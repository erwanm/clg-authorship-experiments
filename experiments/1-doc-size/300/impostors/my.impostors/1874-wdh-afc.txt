error like mine. Sometime, if ever the thought of 
me is a greater pain than it is at this moment, you 
can forgive me. Yes, you can do that for me." 

" But who, who will ever forgive me," she cried, 
"for my blindness ! Oh, you must believe that I 
never thought, I never dreamt " 

" I know it well. It was your fatal truth that 
did it ; truth too high and fino for me to have dis 
cerned save through such agony as .... You too 



 

loved my soul, like the rest, and you would have 
had me no priest for the reason that they would 
have had me a priest I see it. But you had no 
right to love my soul and not me you, a woman. 
A woman must not love only the soul of a man." 

" Yes, yes I " piteously explained the girl, " but 
you were a priest to me ! " 

"That is true, madamigella. I was always a 
priest to you ; and now I see that I never could be 
otherwise. Ah, the wrong began many years be 
fore we met. I was trying to blame you a lit 
tle " - 

" Blame me, blame me ; do ! " 

" but there is no blame. Think that it was 
another way of asking your forgiveness. . . . O my 
God, my God, my God ! " 

He released his hands from her, and uttered this 
cry under his breath, with his face lifted towards 
the heavens. When he looked at her again, he 
said : " Madamigella, if my share of this misery 
gives me the right to ask of you " 

" Oh ask anything of me ! I will give every 
thing, do everything I " 

He faltered, and then, " You do not love me," he 
said abruptly ; " is there some one else that you 
love ? " 

She did not answer. 

"Is it . . . he?" 

She hid her face. 

"I knew it," groaned the priest, kt I knew that, 
too ! " and he turned awav. 



 

" Don Ippolito, Don Ippolito oh, poor, poor 
Don Ippolito ! " cried the girl, springing towards 
him. " Is this the way you leave me ? Where 
are you going ? What will you do now ? " 

"Did I not say? I am going to die a priest." 

" Is there nothing that you will let me be to you, 
hope for you ? " 

" Nothing," said Don Ippolito, after a moment. 
" What could you? " He seized the hands implor 
ingly extended towards him, and clasped them to 
gether and kissed them both. " Adieu ! " he whis 
pered ; then he opened them, and passionately 
kissed either palm ; " adieu, adieu ! " 

A great wave of sorrow and compassion and de 
spair for him swept through her. She flung her 
arms about his neck, and pulled his head down upon 
her heart, and held it tight there, weeping and 
moaning over him as over some hapless, harmless 
thing that she had unpurposely bruised or killed. 
Then she suddenly put her hand against his breast, 
and thrust him away, and turned and ran. 

Ferris stepped back again into the shadow of the 
tree from which he had just emerged, and clung to 
its trunk lest he should fall. Another seemed to 
creep out of the court in his person, and totter 
across the white glare of the campo and down the 
blackness of the calle. In the intersected spaces 
where the moonlight fell, this alien, miserable man 
saw the figure of a priest gliding on before him. 



XVI. 

FLORIDA swiftly mounted the terrace steps, but 
she stopped with her hand on the door, panting, and 
turned and walked slowly away to the end of the 
terrace, drying her eyes with dashes of her hand 
kerchief, and ordering her hair, some coils of which 
had been loosened by her flight. Then she went 
back to the door, waited, and softly opened it. 
Her mother was not in the parlor where she had 
left her, and she passed noiselessly into her own 
room, where some trunks stood open and half- 
packed against the wall. She began to gather up 
the pieces of dress that lay upon the bed and chairs, 
and to fold them with mechanical carefulness and 
put them in the boxes. Her mother's voice called 
from the other chamber, u Is that you, Florida ? " 

" Yes, mother," answered the girl, but remained 
kneeling before one of the boxes, with that pale 
green robe in her hand which she had worn on the 
morning when Ferris had first brought Don Ippo- 
lito to see them. She smoothed its folds and looked 
down at it without making any motion to pack it 
away, and so she lingered while her mother ad 
vanced with one question after another ; " What are 
you doing, Florida ? Where are you ? Why didn 't 
you come to me ? " and finally stood in the door- 




way. " Oh, you're packing. Do you know, Flor 
ida, I'm getting very impatient about going. I 
wish we could be off at once." 

A tremor passed over the young girl and she 
started from her languid posture, and laid the dress 
in the trunk. " So do I, mother. I would give the 
world if we could go to-morrow ! " 

" Yes, but we can 't, you see. I'm afraid we Ve 
undertaken a great deal, my dear. It's quite a 
weight upon my mind, already ; and I don 't know 
what it will be. If we were free, now, I should 
say, go to-morrow, by all means. But we could n t 
arrange it with Don Ippolito on our hands." 

Florida waited a moment before she replied. 
Then she said coldly, " Don Ippolito is not going 
with us, mother." 

" Not going with us ? Why " 

" He is not going to America. He will not leave 
Venice ; he is to remain a priest," said Florida, dog 
gedly. 

Mrs. Vervain sat down in the chair that stood 
beside the door. " Not going to America ; not 
leave Venice; remain a priest? Florida, you as 
tonish me ! But I am not the least surprised, not 
the least in the world. I thought Don Ippolito 
would give out, all along. He is not what I should 
call fickle, exactly, but he is weak, or timid, rather. 
He is a good man, but he lacks courage, resolution. 
I always doubted if he would succeed in America ; 
he is too much of a dreamer. But this, really, goes 



 

a little beyond anything. I never expected this. 
What did he say, Florida? How did he excuse 
himself ? " 

" I hardly know ; very little. What was there 
to say ? " 

" To be sure, to be sure. Did you try to reason 
with him, Florida?" 

" No," answered the girl, drearily. 

" I am glad of that. I think you had said quite 
enough already. You owed it to yourself not to do 
so, and he might have misinterpreted it. These 
foreigners are very different from Americans. No 
doubt we should have had a time of it, if he had 
gone with us. It must be for the best. I'm sure 
it was ordered so. But all that doesn 't relieve 
Don Ippolito from the charge of black ingratitude, 
and want of consideration for us. He's quite made 
fools of us." 

"He was not to blame. It was a very great step 
for him. And if " .... 

" I know that. But he ought not to have talked 
of it. He ought to have known his own mind fully 
before speaking ; that's the only safe way. Well, 
then, there is nothing to prevent our going to-mor 
row." 

Florida drew a long breath, and rose to go on 
with the work of packing. 

" Have you been crying, Florida ? Well, of 
course, you can 't help feeling sorry for such a man. 
There's a great deal of good in Don Ippolito, a 



 

great deal. But when you come to my age you 
won 't cry so easily, my dear. It's very trying," 
said Mrs. Vervain. She sat awhile in silence be 
fore she asked : " Will he come here to-morrow 
morning ? " 

Her daughter looked at her with a glance of ter 
rified inquiry. 

"Do have your wits about you, my dear ! We 
can 't go away without saying good-by to him, and 
we can 't go away without paying him." 

" Paying him ? " 

" Yes, paying him paying him for your les 
sons. It's always been very awkward. He hasn t 
been like other teachers, you know : more like a 
guest, or friend of the family. He never seemed 
to want to take the money, and of late, I Ve been 
letting it run along, because I hated so to offer ic, 
till now, it's quite a sum. I suppose he needs it, 
poor fellow. And how to get it to him is the ques 
tion. He may not come to-morrow, as usual, and 
I could n t trust it to the padrone. We might 
send it to him in a draft from Paris, but I d rather 
pay him before we go. Besides, it would be rather 
rude, going away without seeing him again." Mrs. 
Vervain thought a moment ; then, " I'll tell you," 
she resumed. " If he doesn 't happen to come here 
to-morrow morning, we can stop on our way to the 
station and give him the money." 

Florida did not answer. 

"don 't you think that would be a good plan ? " 



 

" I don 't know," replied the girl in a dull way 

" Why, Florida, if you think from anything Don 
Ippolito said that he would rather not see us again 
that it would be painful to him why, we could 
ask Mr. Ferris to hand him the money." 

" Oh no, no, no, mother! " cried Florida, hiding 
her face, " that would be too horribly indelicate ! " 

" Well, perhaps it would n t be quite good taste," 
said Mrs. Vervain perturbedly, "but you needn t 
express yourself so violently, my dear. It's not a 
matter of life and death. I'm sure I don 't know 
what to do. We must stop at Don Ippolito's 
house, I suppose. don 't you think so ? " 

" Yes," faintly assented the daughter. 

Mrs. Vervain yawned. "Well I can 't think 
anything more about it to-night ; I'm too stupid. 
But that's the way we shall do. Will you help me 
to bed, my dear ? I shall be good for nothing to 
morrow." 

She went on talking of Don Ippolito's change of 
purpose till her head touched the pillow, from 
which she suddenly lifted it again, and called out to 
her daughter, who had passed into the next room : 
" But Mr. Ferris why didn t he come back with 
you?" 

" Come back with me ? " 

" Why yes, child. I sent him out to call you, 
just before you came in. This Don Ippolito busi 
ness put him quite out of my head. didn 't you 
see him ? . Oh ! What's that ? "
