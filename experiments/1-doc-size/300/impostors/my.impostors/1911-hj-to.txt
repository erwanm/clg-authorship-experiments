opinion?--which is but another name for the chatter of all the fools one
doesn’t know, in addition to all those (and plenty of ‘em!) one damnably
does.”

Lady Sandgate, by a turn of the hand, dropped oil from her golden cruse.
“Ah, you did that, in your own grand way, before you went abroad!”

“I don’t speak of the matter, my dear man, in the light of its effect on
you,” Lord John importantly explained--“but in the light of its effect
on Bender; who so consumedly wants the picture, if he is to have it,
to be a Mantovano, but seems unable to get it taken at last for anything
but the fine old Moretto that of course it has always been.”

Lord Theign, in growing disgust at the whole beastly complication,
betrayed more and more the odd pitch of the temper that had abruptly
restored him with such incalculable weight to the scene of action.
“Well, isn’t a fine old Moretto good enough for him; confound him?”

It pulled up not a little Lord John, who yet made his point. “A fine old
Moretto, you know, was exactly what he declined at Dedborough--for its
comparative, strictly comparative, insignificance; and he only thought
of the picture when the wind began to rise for the enormous rarity--”

“That that mendacious young cad who has bamboozled Grace,” Lord Theign
broke in, “tried to befool us, for his beggarly reasons, into claiming
for it?”

Lady Sandgate renewed her mild influence. “Ah, the knowing people
haven’t had their last word--the possible Mantovano isn’t exploded
yet!” Her noble friend, however, declined the offered spell. “I’ve
had enough of the knowing people--the knowing people are serpents! My
picture’s to take or to leave--and it’s what I’ve come back, if you
please, John, to say to your man to his face.”

This declaration had a report as sharp and almost as multiplied as the
successive cracks of a discharged revolver; yet when the light smoke
cleared Lady Sand-gate at least was still left standing and smiling.
“Yes, why in mercy’s name can’t he choose which?--and why does he
write him, dreadful Breckenridge, such tiresome argumentative letters?”

Lord John took up her idea as with the air of something that had been
working in him rather vehemently, though under due caution too, as a
consequence of this exchange, during which he had apprehensively watched
his elder. “I don’t think I quite see how, my dear Theign, the poor
chap’s letter was so offensive.”

In that case his dear Theign could tell him. “Because it was a tissue
of expressions that may pass current--over counters and in awful
newspapers--in his extraordinary world or country, but that I decline
to take time to puzzle out here.”

“If he didn’t make himself understood,” Lord John took leave to laugh,
“it must indeed have been an unusual production for Bender.”

“Oh, I often, with the wild beauty, if you will, of so many of his
turns, haven’t a notion,” Lady Sandgate confessed with an equal gaiety,
“of what he’s talking about.”

“I think I never miss his weird sense,” her younger guest again loyally
contended--“and in fact as a general thing I rather like it!”

“I happen to like nothing that I don’t enjoy,” Lord Theign rejoined with
some asperity--“and so far as I do follow the fellow he assumes on my
part an interest in his expenditure of purchase-money that I neither
feel nor pretend to. He doesn’t want--by what I spell out--the picture
he refused at Dedborough; he may possibly want--if one reads it so--the
picture on view in Bond Street; and he yet appears to make, with great
emphasis, the stupid ambiguous point that these two ‘articles’ (the
greatest of Morettos an ‘article’!) haven’t been ‘by now’ proved
different: as if I engaged with him that I myself would so prove them!”

Lord John indulged in a pause--but also in a suggestion. “He must
allude to your hoping--when you allowed us to place the picture with
Mackintosh--that it would show to all London in the most precious light
conceivable.”

“Well, if it hasn’t so shown”--and Lord Theign stared as if
mystified--“what in the world’s the meaning of this preposterous
racket?”

“The racket is largely,” his young friend explained, “the vociferation
of the people who contradict each other about it.”

On which their hostess sought to enliven the gravity of the question.
“Some--yes--shouting on the housetops that’s a Mantovano of the
Mantovanos, and others shrieking back at them that they’re donkeys if
not criminals.”

“He may take it for whatever he likes,” said Lord Theign, heedless of
these contributions, “he may father it on Michael Angelo himself if
he’ll but clear out with it and let me alone!”

“What he’d like to take it for,” Lord John at this point saw his way
to remark, “is something in the nature of a Hundred Thousand.”

“A Hundred Thousand?” cried his astonished friend.

“Quite, I dare say, a Hundred Thousand”--the young man enjoyed clearly
handling even by the lips so round a sum.

Lady Sandgate disclaimed however with agility any appearance of having
gaped. “Why, haven’t you yet realised, Theign, that those are the
American figures?”

His lordship looked at her fixedly and then did the same by Lord John,
after which he waited a little. “I’ve nothing to do with the American
figures--which seem to me, if you press me, you know, quite intolerably
vulgar.”

“Well, I’d be as vulgar as anybody for a Hundred Thousand!” Lady
Sandgate hastened to proclaim.

“Didn’t he let us know at Dedborough,” Lord John asked of the master of
that seat, “that he had no use, as he said, for lower values?”

“I’ve heard him remark myself,” said their companion, rising to the
monstrous memory, “that he wouldn’t take a cheap picture--even though a
‘handsome’ one--as a present.”

“And does he call the thing round the corner a cheap picture?” the
proprietor of the work demanded.

Lord John threw up his arms with a grin of impatience. “All he wants to
do, don’t you see? is to prevent your making it one!”

Lord Theign glared at this imputation to him of a low ductility. “I
offered the thing, as it was, at an estimate worthy of it--and of me.”

“My dear reckless friend,” his young adviser protested, “you named no
figure at all when it came to the point----!”

“It didn’t come to the point! Nothing came to the point but that I put
a Moretto on view; as a thing, yes, perfectly”--Lord Theign accepted the
reminding gesture--“on which a rich American had an eye and in which he
had, so to speak, an interest. That was what I wanted, and so we left
it--parting each of us ready but neither of us bound.”

“Ah, Mr. Bender’s bound, as he’d say,” Lady Sand-gate
interposed--“‘bound’ to make you swallow the enormous luscious plum that
your appetite so morbidly rejects!”

“My appetite, as morbid as you like”--her old friend had shrewdly turned
on her--“is my own affair, and if the fellow must deal in enormities I
warn him to carry them elsewhere!”

Lord John, plainly, by this time, was quite exasperated at the absurdity
of him. “But how can’t you see that it’s only a plum, as she says, for
a plum and an eye for an eye--since the picture itself, with this huge
ventilation, is now quite a different affair?”

“How the deuce a different affair when just what the man himself
confesses is that, in spite of all the chatter of the prigs and pedants,
there’s no really established ground for treating it as anything but
the same?” On which, as having so unanswerably spoken, Lord Theign shook
himself free again, in his high petulance, and moved restlessly to where
the passage to the other room appeared to offer his nerves an issue; all
moreover to the effect of suggesting to us that something still other
than what he had said might meanwhile work in him behind and beneath
that quantity. The spectators of his trouble watched him, for the time,
in uncertainty and with a mute but associated comment on the perversity
and oddity he had so suddenly developed; Lord John giving a shrug of
almost bored despair and Lady Sandgate signalling caution and tact for
their action by a finger flourished to her lips, and in fact at once
proceeding to apply these arts. The subject of her attention had still
remained as in worried thought; he had even mechanically taken up a book
from a table--which he then, after an absent glance at it, tossed down.

“You’re so detached from reality, you adorable dreamer,” she began--“and
unless you stick to that you might as well have done nothing. What
you call the pedantry and priggishness and all the rest of it is exactly
what poor Breckenridge asked almost on his knees, wonderful man, to
be allowed to pay you for; since even if the meddlers and chatterers
haven’t settled anything for those who know--though which of the elect
themselves after all does seem to know?--it’s a great service rendered
him to have started such a hare to run!”

Lord John took freedom to throw off very much the same idea. “Certainly
his connection with the whole question and agitation makes no end for
his glory.”

It didn’t, that remark, bring their friend back to him, but it at least
made his indifference flash with derision. “His ‘glory’--Mr. Bender’s
glory? Why, they quite universally loathe him--judging by the stuff they
print!”

“Oh, here--as a corrupter of our morals and a promoter of our decay,
even though so many are flat on their faces to him--yes! But it’s
another affair over there where the eagle screams like a thousand
steam-whistles and the newspapers flap like the leaves of the forest:
there he’ll be, if you’ll only let him, the biggest thing going; since
sound, in that air, seems to mean size, and size to be all that counts.
If he said of the thing, as you recognise,” Lord John went on, “‘It’s
going to be a Mantovano,’ why you can bet your life that it is--that
it has got to be some kind of a one.”

His fellow-guest, at this, drew nearer again, irritated, you would
have been sure, by the unconscious infelicity of the pair--worked up
to something quite openly wilful and passionate. “No kind of a furious
flaunting one, under my patronage, that I can prevent, my boy! The
Dedborough picture in the market--owing to horrid little circumstances
that regard myself alone--is the Dedborough picture at a decent,
sufficient, civilised Dedborough price, and nothing else whatever; which
I beg you will take as my last word on the subject.”

Lord John, trying whether he could take it, momentarily mingled his
hushed state with that of their hostess, to whom he addressed a helpless
look; after which, however, he appeared to find that he could only
reassert himself. “May I nevertheless reply that I think you’ll not be
able to prevent anything?--since the discussed object will completely
escape your control in New York!”

“And almost any discussed object”--Lady Sand-gate rose to the occasion
also--“is in New York, by what one hears, easily worth a Hundred
Thousand!”

Lord Theign looked from one of them to the other. “I sell the man a
Hundred Thousand worth of swagger and advertisement; and of fraudulent
swagger and objectionable advertisement at that?”

“Well”--Lord John was but briefly baffled--“when the picture’s his you
can’t help its doing what it can and what it will for him anywhere!”

“Then it isn’t his yet,” the elder man retorted--“and I promise you
never will be if he has sent you to me with his big drum!”

Lady Sandgate turned sadly on this to her associate in patience, as
if the case were now really beyond them. “Yes, how indeed can it ever
become his if Theign simply won’t let him pay for it?”

Her question was unanswerable. “It’s the first time in all my life I’ve
known a man feel insulted, in such a piece of business, by happening
not to be, in the usual way, more or less swindled!”

“Theign is unable to take it in,” her ladyship explained, “that--as I’ve
heard it said of all these money-monsters of the new type--Bender simply
can’t afford not to be cited and celebrated as the biggest buyer who
ever lived.”

“Ah, cited and celebrated at my expense--say it at once and have it
over, that I may enjoy what you all want to do to me!”

“The dear man’s inimitable--at his ‘expense’!” It was more than Lord
John could bear as he fairly flung himself off in his derisive impotence
and addressed his wail to Lady Sandgate.

“Yes, at my expense is exactly what I mean,” Lord Theign
asseverated--“at the expense of my modest claim to regulate my behaviour
by my own standards. There you perfectly are about the man, and it’s
precisely what I say--that he’s to hustle and harry me because he’s a
money-monster: which I never for a moment dreamed of, please understand,
when I let you, John, thrust him at me as a pecuniary resource at
Dedborough. I didn’t put my property on view that he might blow about
it------!”

“No, if you like it,” Lady Sandgate returned; “but you certainly didn’t
so arrange”--she seemed to think her point somehow would help--“that
you might blow about it yourself!”

“Nobody wants to ‘blow,’” Lord John more stoutly interposed, “either hot
or cold, I take it; but I really don’t see the harm of Bender’s liking
to be known for the scale of his transactions--actual or merely imputed
even, if you will; since that scale is really so magnificent.”

Lady Sandgate half accepted, half qualified this plea. “The only
question perhaps is why he doesn’t try for some precious work that
somebody--less delicious than dear Theign--can be persuaded on bended
knees to accept a hundred thousand for.”

“‘Try’ for one?”--her younger visitor took it up while her elder more
attentively watched him. “That was exactly what he did try for when he
pressed you so hard in vain for the great Sir Joshua.”

“Oh well, he mustn’t come back to that--must he, Theign?” her ladyship
cooed.

That personage failed to reply, so that Lord John went on, unconscious
apparently of the still more suspicious study to which he exposed
himself. “Besides which there are no things of that magnitude knocking
about, don’t you know?--they’ve got to be worked up first if they’re
to reach the grand publicity of the Figure! Would you mind,” he
continued to his noble monitor, “an agreement on some such basis as
this?--that you shall resign yourself to the biggest equivalent you’ll
squeamishly consent to take, if it’s at the same time the smallest he’ll
squeamishly consent to offer; but that, that done, you shall leave him
free----”

Lady Sandgate took it up straight, rounding it off, as their companion
only waited. “Leave him free to talk about the sum offered and the sum
taken as practically one and the same?”

“Ah, you know,” Lord John discriminated, “he doesn’t ‘talk’ so much
himself--there’s really nothing blatant or crude about poor Bender. It’s
the rate at which--by the very way he’s ‘fixed’: an awful way indeed, I
grant you!--a perfect army of reporter-wretches, close at his heels, are
always talking for him and of him.”

Lord Theign spoke hereupon at last with the air as of an impulse that
had been slowly gathering force. “You talk for him, my dear chap,
pretty well. You urge his case, my honour, quite as if you were assured
of a commission on the job--on a fine ascending scale! Has he put you
