meddle with what don't concern me. All I got to 
do is to cook the victuals, and take care of the 
cabin." 

Dick was utterly indifferent in regard to the 
conspirators, and went on scraping his potatoes, 
as though nothing unusual was in progress. As 



 

long as tliey had not carried off his cooking stove, 
or separated him from the ice chest, he. was per- 
fectly contented, and undoubtedly would call all 
hands to supper at the proper time, precisely as 
though every thing was proceeding in a proper 
and regular manner on board the Flyaway. Dick 
prided himself upon minding his own business; 
and if the yacht had been seized by a gang of 
West India buccaneers, his culinary operations 
would have proceeded with their accustomed order 
and promptness. 

It was not so with Paul ; for the creaking of 
the windlass, and the activity that seemed to be 
manifested on deck, had already suggested to him 
a suspicion in regard to the purpose of the crew. 
He was not long left in doubt, for the sounds 
from above soon indicated that a portion of the 
conspirators were hoisting the mainsail. But he 
found it very difficult to accept the conclusion 
that these indications forced upon him. Txie boys 
on deck were certainly getting the yacht in read- 
iness to sail ; yet it seemed scarcely credible to 




 

him that they intended to run away with her. 
A scheme so bold and wicked passed his compre- 
hension, and he was not prepared to believe that 
even Tom and Frank had the hardihood to carry 
it out. But the evidences were fast increasing ; 
he heard the voice of Tom Nettle, as he stood at 
the helm, issuing his orders with as much assurance 
as though he had been regularly placed in au- 
thority. 

Presently he heard the anchor strike against 
the hawse-hole, and the jib rattling up the stay. 
He could no longer cherish a hope that their pur- 
pose was less criminal than he had feared. He 
almost cried with sorrow and vexation when he 
considered that his brother John was one of the 
mutineers. 

" They are running away with the yacht," said 
he to his fellow-prisoner. 

" That's none of my business," replied Dick, 
with his accustomed stoicism. " All I got to say 
is, that supper will be ready at six o'clock ; be- 
cause why — that's the time Captain Gordon told 
me to have supper." 



 

" But do you mean to let them run away with 
the yacht ? " 

-"Don't see that I can help myself;" and the 
steward suspended his labors for a moment, glan- 
cing at Paul as though he had a vague suspicion 
that he might be in some degree responsible for 
his inactivity. 

" I think we have a duty to what perform," con- 
tinued Paul. 

"What can we do?" 

" We must get the vessel away from them, and 
take her back to her anchorage." 

" But we can't do that. We are prisoners here ; 
can you break through that hatchway ? " 

" Then you are willing to do something ? " 

" Certainly I am," replied Dick. " If you can 
tell me what to do, I will do it." 

Paul seated himself by the side of the steward, 
and proposed to him that, at a suitable time, they 
should make an effort to recover the yacht, and 
return her to her lawful commander. Dick con- 
sented, but he was afraid they would have no 



 

opportunity to put the plan in execution, for they 
could hardly overcome the eleven mutineers. Yet 
each pledged himself to the other to do whatever 
could be done ; but it was agreed that they should 
not attempt any thing without a reasonable pros- 
pect of success. 

There was a stiff breeze from the north-east, 
and the prisoners saw the yacht lying over upon 
her side, which gave some indication of the rate 
at which she was passing through the water. 
They knew how dense was the fog outside, and 
they had some fears that her reckless managers 
would run her upon the rocks, which was not a 
pleasant prospect to them, confined as they were 
in the cabin. 

An hour by the clock had elapsed since the 
yacht got under way, and it was evident from her 
motion that she was laboring through a heavy 
sea. Paul had begun to be uneasy, for he had 
very little confidence in the seamanship of Tom 
Nettle, who, he judged, was the new master of 
the Flyaway, and he was in momentary expecta- 



 

tion that she would strike upon a rock, and the 
cabin be filled with water. 

When the yacht first got under way there had 
been a great deal of confusion on deck. Frank 
had rebelled at the authority of Tom, and claimed 
the right to command ; but this dispute had been 
settled, and new causes of difficulty had appeared 
every momenti. But now the conspirators were 
very quiet, and Paul perceived that they had 
come to realize the full peril of their position. 
He could hear their low and earnest tones, as 
they consulted together in the standing room. 
More than once he had heard his own name men- 
tioned, but he could not hear enough of the con- 
versation to determine what they intended to do 
with him. We will leave Paul and his fellow- 
prisoner below for a time, and notice the condition 
of things on deck. 

The weather was decidedly threatening. The 

wind was increasing in violence, and there was a 

heavy sea. In short there was every indication 

of a regular north-easter. Tom Nettle had the 

 

helm, but his face no longer wore the confident 
assurance which had given him the victory over 
his rival in the contest for the command, and 
which had strengthened the doubting hearts of 
his more timid followers. His eye was restless, 
and his movements uneasy. He was not a stupid 
boy — only a reckless one ; and he could not help 
seeing that he was leading those who had trusted 
in him into hardship and perils which neither 
party had foreseen. 

The Flyaway was lying close to the wind, un- 
der jib and mainsail, and was completely enveloped 
in the dense fog that covered the ocean. Her 
bowsprit was slapping the waves, and the spray 
sweeping the entire length of the deck. Frank 
Thompson was lying out upon the bowsprit, wet 
to the skin, peering through the fog to give 
timely notice of breakers, or of any vessel which 
might lie in the path, of the yacht. The rest of 
the crew were seated in the standing room, most 
of them engaged in watching the anxious face of 
Tom Nettle, whose boasted seamanship was now 
put to the severest test. 



 

The Flyaway dashed on, and the faces of the 
rebel crew became more and more anxious every 
moment. Another hour elapsed, and the wind 
continued to freshen, and the sea to rise. Dense 
volumes of fog rolled by the vessel, and the mu- 
tineers were all wet to the skin. John Duncan 
was the only one who seemed to enjoy the scene, 
and it was evident at times that even he had 
some painful misgivings in regard to the future. 

" Hard a-lee ! hard a-lee ! " shouted Frank, sud- 
denly jumping down from the bowsprit, and mak- 
ing the most violent gestures. 

Tom, startled and confused by the frantic move- 
ments of Frank, unfortunately put the helm the 
wrong way ; and the yacht, getting the wind more 
a-beam, plunged deeper than ever into the huge 
waves. 

" The other way, you confounded fool ! " roared 
Frank, as he let go of the jib sheet. 

The bewildered helmsman obeyed this order ; 
but the movement had been so long delayed that 
the whole crew could hear the roar of the breakers 



 

ahead of the yacht. With the assistance of his 
companions Tom put the hehn hard-a-lee, and the 
Flyaway came up into the wind. 

But Frank had made a greater blunder, if pos- 
sible, than the confused skipper ; for when he had 
cast oif the jib sheet, long before he should have 
done so, the sail had blown out as far as it could, 
carrying the end of the sheet with it. 

My young and non-nautical readers must not 
suppose that a sheet is a sail ; it is a rope. The 
jib-sheet is the rope attached to the lower part 
of the sail, by which it is hauled in or let out, as 
occasion may require. On the Flyaway this rope 
ran through a double block, or tackle. The sail 
was now slapping and banging in the fresh wind, 
so that Frank could not get hold of it ; for the 
heavy block threatened to knock his brains out, 
as it threshed in every direction. 

In consequence of this blunder, when the yacht 
came up into the wind, and there was no jib to 
help her round, she fell off, lost her headway, and 
drifted helplessly towards the rocks. Tom was 




appalled at the danwhatjer that menaced them, and 
gave all sorts of orders ; but none of them were 
heeded by the panic-stricken crew. 

'/Draw the slide, and call up Paul," gasped 
the disheartened skipper ; and this order was un- 
derstood and instantly obeyed. 



 



CHAPTER. XIX. 

PAUL TAKES COMMAND OF THE FLYAWAY. 

" Help us, Paul, if you can," cried Tom, as 
the prisoners rushed up the ladder. '' You take 
the helm, Dick." 

"Me!" exclaimed the steward. " I don't know 
no more about handling a vessel than I do about 
making a watch. Paul must help you." 

" Forgive me, Paul, for shutting you up down 
there, and get us out of this scrape if you can." 

At this moment the keel of the Flyaway grazed 
upon a rock, and then bumped heavily as she 
sank down with the sea. 

" We are lost ! We shall all be drowned ! " 
exclaimed Frank Thompson. 

Paul's quick eye instantly measured the peril 
that menaced the Flyaway, and though she con- 
tinued to thump and grind on the rocks at the 



 

bottom, lie did not lose all hope of saving her.
