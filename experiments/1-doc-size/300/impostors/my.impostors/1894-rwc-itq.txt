"That is for me, in case of need. I will need 
it too, very soon!" 

His companion glared at him, and bit her lip. 

"If you and I are to remain dear friends," 
continued Mr. Pick, "we must manage to raise 
money, somehow. You know that as well as I 
do." 

Still she said nothing, but kept her eyes on 
his face. He glanced up, and looked away un 
easily. 

"I have seen my uncle again. He knows all 
about your sister and the American. He says 
it is only because of him that she refuses the 
handsome offer." 

The woman's face grew tigerish, and she 



 

nodded rapidly, muttering, "Ah! yes! Mais oui! 
the American. I do not forget him!" 

"My dear uncle thinks it is our fault that your 
sister refuses to forget him, which is more to 
the purpose," sneered Pick. "He says you did 
not press that offer he made Yvonne with any 
skill, else she would never have refused it again; 
that makes four times," he added. "Four 
times she has refused an establishment and " 

"Pst! what are you raising your voice for?" 
hissed the woman. "And how is it my fault?" 
she went on. 

"I don't say it is. I know better who could 
wish more than we that your sister should be 
come the mistress of my dear rich uncle? But 
when I tried to tell him just now that we had 
done our best, he raved at me. He has guessed 
somehow that they mean to marry. I did not 
tell him that we too had guessed it. But he 
said I knew it, and was concealing it from him. 
I asked him for a little money to go on with. 
Curse him, he would not lend me a sou! Said 
he never would again Curse him!" 

There was a silence, while Pick smoked on. 
The woman did not smoke too, because she had 





no cigarette, and Pick did not offer her any. 
Presently he spoke again. 

"Yes, you certainly are an expensive luxury, 
under the circumstances, And since you have 
so mismanaged your fool of a sister's affair, I 
don't see how the circumstances can improve." 

She watched him. "And the ten thousand 
francs? You will throw me off and enjoy them 
at your ease?" 

He cringed at her tone. "Not enjoy with 
out you " 

"No," she said coolly, "for I shall kill you." 

Mr. Pick smiled uncomfortably. "That would 
please the American, "he said, trying to jest, but 
his hand trembled as he touched the stem of his 
cigar-holder to shake off the ashes. 

A sudden thought leaped into her face. "-Why 
not please me instead?" she whispered. 

Their eyes met. Her face was hard and bold 
his, cowardly and ghastly. She clenched her 
hands and leaned forward; her voice was scarcely 
audible. Mr. Pick dropped his oily black head 
and listened. 

"He turned me out of his box at the Opera; 
he struck you do you hear? he kicked you!" 



 

The Jew's face grew chalky. 

"To-day he stands between you and your 
uncle, you and wealth, you and me! Do you 
understand? Cowards are stupid. You claim 
Spanish blood. But Spanish blood does not 
forget insults. Is yours only the blood of a 
Spanish Jew? Bah! Must I talk? You saw 
him? He is here. Alive. And he kicked you. 
And he stands between you and riches, you 
and me, you and life!" 

They sat silent, she holding him fascinated 
with her little black eyes. His jaw fallen, the 
expression of his loose mouth was horrible. 
Suddenly she thrust her face close to his. Her 
eyes burned and the blood surged through the 
distended veins under the cracking rouge. Her 
lips formed the word, "To-night!" 

Without a word he crept from his seat and fol 
lowed her out of the room by a side door. 

Gethryn lounging in the smoking-room mean 
while, was listening with delight to the bellow 
ing of Sir Griffin Damby, who stood at the clerk's 
desk in the hall. 

"Don't contradict me!" he roared; the weak- 
eyed clerk had not dreamed of doing so, "Don't 





you contradict me! I tell you it's the same 
man!" 

"But Excellence," entreated the clerk, "we 
do not know " 

"What! Don't know! Don't I tell you?" 

"We will telegraph to Paris" 

"Telegraph to hell! Where's my man? Here! 
Dawson! Do you remember that infernal Jew 
at Monaco? He's here. He's in there!" jerk 
ing an angry thumb at the cafe door. "Keep 
him in sight, till the police come for him. If 
he says anything, kick him into the lake." 

Dawson bowed. 

The clerk tried to say that he would tele 
graph instantly, but Sir Griffin barked in his 
face, and snorted his way down the hall followed 
by the valet. 

Rex, laughing, threw down his cigarette, and 
sauntered over to the clerk. 

"Whom does the Englishman want kicked 
out?" 

The clerk made a polite gesture, asking Rex 
to wait until he had finished telegraphing. At 
that moment the postillion's horn heralded the 
coming of the mail coach, and that meant the 



 

speedy arrival of the last western train. Rex 
forgot Sir Griffin and strolled over to the post 
office to watch the distribution of the letters and 
to get his own. 

A great deal of flopping arid pounding seemed 
to be required as a preliminary to postal distri 
bution. First the mail bags seemed to be 
dragged all over the floor, then came a long 
series of thumps, while the letters were stamped, 
finally the slide was raised and a face the color 
of under-done pie crust, with little angry eyes, 
appeared. The owner had a new and ingenious 
insult for each person who presented himself. 
The Tweelers were utterly routed, and went 
away, not knowing whether there were any let 
ters for them or not. Several valets and ladies 
maids exchanged lively but ineffectual compli 
ments with the face in the post office window. 
Then came Sir Griffin. Rex looked on with 
interest. What the ill-natured brute behind the 
grating said, Rex couldn't hear, but Sir Griffin 
burst out with a roar, "Damnation!" that made 
everybody jump. Then he stuck his head as 
far as he could get it in at the little win 
dow, and shouted, in fluent German, awfully 





pronounced, "Here! You! It's enough that 
you're so stupid you don't know what you're 
about. Don't you try to be impudent too! 
Hand me those letters!" The official bully 
handed them over without a word. 

Rex took advantage of the lull, and stepped 
to the window. "Any letters for Mr. Gethryn?" 

"How you spell him?" Rex spelled him. 

"Yet once again!" demanded the intelligent 
person. Rex wrote it in English and in Ger 
man script. 

"From Trauerbach Yes?" 

"Yes." 

The man went away, looked through two 
ledgers, sent for another, made out several sets 
of blanks, and finally came back to the window, 
but said nothing. 

"Well?" said Rex, pleasantly. 

"Well," said the man. 

"Anything for me?" 

"Nothing for you." 

"Kindly look again," said Rex. "I know there 
are letters for me." 

In about ten minutes the man appeared again, 
-"Well?" said Gethryn. 



 

"Well," said the man. 

"Nothing for me?" 

"Something." And with ostentatious delay 
he produced three letters and a newspaper, 
which Rex took, restraining an impulse to knock 
him down. After all, the temptation was not 
very great, presenting itself more as an act of 
justice than as a personal satisfaction. The 
truth was, all day long a great gentleness tinged 
with melancholy had rested on Gethryn's spirit. 
Nothing seemed to matter very much. And 
whatever engaged his attention for a moment, it 
was only for a moment, and then his thoughts 
returned where they had been all day. 

Yvonne, Yvonne! She had not been out of 
his thoughts since he rose that morning. In a 
few steps he reached his room, and read his let 
ters by the waning daylight. 

The first began: 

"My Darling: In three more days I shall 
stand before a Paris audience. I am not one 
bit nervous. I am perfectly happy. Yesterday 
at rehearsal the orchestra applauded and 
Madame Bordier kissed me. Some very droll 
things happened, Achilles was intoxicated and 





chased Ajax the Less with a stick. Ajax fled into 
my dressing-room, and although I was not there 
I told Achilles afterward that I would never for 
give him. Then he wept." 

The letter ran on for a page more of lively 
gossip, and then with a sudden change, ended: 

"But why do I write these foolish things to 
you? Ah! you know it is because I am too 
happy! too happy! and I cannot say what is in 
my heart. I dare not. It is too soon. I dare 
not! 

"If it is that I am happy, who but you knows 
the reason? And now listen to my little secret. 
I pray for you, yes, every morning and every 
evening. And for myself too now. 

"God forgives. It is in my faith. Oh! my
