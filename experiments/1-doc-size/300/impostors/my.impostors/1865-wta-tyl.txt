Perhaps not," replied Somers, bewildered at the 

suggestion. 

" I know you are, my dear boy. I was sent for just 
four weeks after the battle of Solferino, and made a 
brigadier-general," persisted the captain. 
Ah ! then you are General de Banyan?" 
No, no : I dropped the title when I ceased to hold 
the office." 

" That was modest, general." 

" Captain, if you please." 

" You are entitled by courtesy to the use of the title, 
and you shall not be robbed of any of your honors.'' 



' A? a particular favor. Somers, never call me gen- 
eral. I do not wish to rise above my actual rank. I 



have never mentioned the little circumstance of my pro- 
motion before. Your srood fortune was so similar to my 



own. that I was surprised into doing so." 

" What do you mean by my good fortune, captain?" 
TThv. you are promoted asrain. I will bet my vear's 
pay you have had another lift." 


" Nonsense ! I have just been promoted." 

Bah ! what was that to a man of your merit, with a 



senator to speak at court for you ? A petty first-lieu- 
tenancv is nothing for a brilliant fellow like you." 


' I am not half so brilliant a fellow as you declare, 



and I think that a commission as first lieutenant is a 
bis: thins: for a young man like me. I'm sure I never 



had an idea of being an officer at all ; and, when I was 
made a sergeant, I didn't think I deserved it." 

" AVhat do you suppose a major-general can want 
with you t You have heard from Senator Guilford once 
before, and I am satisfied you will hear from him aorain. 


Now. Somers, what do you suppose the general wants 
of you?" 

" I don't know : I think it very likely he wants a man 
of my size to go up the river, or on the other side, scouting ; 
nothing more than that. I am satisfied. But I must obey 
the order.'' added Somers, who had been making his 
preparations during the conversation. 



 

" Well, good-by, my boy ; and I shall have to stand 
one side for you after this, and salute you as major." 

"As what?" 

" Major." 

" How absurd you are, captain ! You always talk 
like a sensible fellow ; that is, when you mean what 
you say." 

" A hard hit ; and very likely the first thing you do, 
when you get to be a major, will be to arrest me for 

lying." 

" Your hit is the hardest, my dear captain. .We have 
seen some hard times together ; and you may be sure, 
that, whatever I am, I shall never forget you." 

" That's hearty, my boy ! Your hand once more," 
replied De Banyan, extending his own. "After the 
battle of Solferiuo " 

" Really, captain, you must excuse me this' time, or 
the general will put me under arrest for my want of 
promptness, instead of sending me on special duty." 

"Well, good luck to you, Somers," said the captain, as 
the lieutenant started for the division headquarters. 

As he passed out of sight, an expression of sadness 
-ottled clown upon Captain de Banyan's face. He looked 
disappointed and uncomfortable, and it is quite probable 
that he envied the good fortune of his young companion 
in arms. If Somers had been brave, and attentive to his 
duty, he had been no less so himself: and he could not 


help feeling that the destruction of those railroad cars 
had made the young man's fortune ; that his rapid 
advancement was a mere stroke of good luck. 

Lieutenant Somers, wondering what could possibly be 
wanted of him, hastened to the headquarters of the 
division. He had no faith whatever in the prognosti- 
cations of Captain de Banyan, and was too modest to 
believe that he had done any thing to merit another pro- 
motion so soon. Recalling the incidents of his career 
since his eventful expedition within the rebel lines, there 
was nothing in his conduct to merit even the notice of 
his superiors, unless it was what others called his skill 
and courage in rallying the broken company at Glendale. 
He had been warmly praised for this act ; but he deemed 
it of little importance, for the memory of AVilliamsburg 
cast into the shade any thing that had occurred to him 
since that bloody day. 

He was ushered into the presence of the general, who 
gave him the kindly welcome which he always bestowed 
upon those of humble rank. Now, Somers cherished 
an intense admiration for this distinguished officer, and 
esteemed it a greater honor to stand in his presence than 
in that of the most powerful sovereign of the earth. 

" Lieutenant Somers?" said the general, extending his 
hand ; a piece of condescension which made our officer 
blush, and appear as awkward as a country school- 
boy. 



 

" Yes, sir ; thank you, sir," stammered Somers, as he 
took the proffered hand. 

" You behaved well at Glendale, Somers," said the 
general bluntly. 

" I endeavored to do my duty, general." 

"You did well on that scout, too ; and I'm going to 
send you out on another, if you have any fancy for such 
work." 

" I will do the best I can," 

" But, my brave fellow, I wish you to be very careful ; 
for we can't afford to lose officers like you." 

" I am always careful, general," said Somers with a 
smile. 

" Can you handle a boat?" 

" Yes, sir : I was brought up among boats." 

" You will go over the river. There is rebel cavalry 
over there, and very likely a considerable force of 


infantry. I am inclined to think they are building 
batteries in the woods, to close up the navigation of 
the river, or perhaps to shell us out of our position. 
In a word, I am instructed to solve the problem, and I 
have selected you to do the work. "What do you 
say?" 

" I am all ready, sir, to undertake that, or any service 
to which I may be ordered." 

"That's the right spirit, Captain Somers ; and I thank 
you for the promptness with which you enter into my 



 

plans. I am satisfied, captain, that you will discharge 
the duty to my entire satisfaction." 

" Thank you, sir."  

" Well, Captain Somers, you shall take what force 
you think necessary. As it will not be prudent for you 
to go over before dark, you may make up your plan, and 
I will listen to the details before you go. How many 
boats shall you want, captain ? ' 

" Only one, sir," replied Somers promptly ; though he 
was wondering with all his might how the general hap- 
pened to make so many blunders in regard to his military 
title, for he had called him captain four or five times. 

"Only one? You will need force enough to protect 
you, captain," replied the general. 

Captain again ! 

" I do not intend to fight the whole rebel army, if it 
is over there. I do not propose to take more than half 
a dozen men with me." 

" I think that is a sensible view of the enterprise ; for 
the more men you take, the greater your chances of being 
discovered. Select your own men, Captain Somers." 

Captain Somers ! The general had certainly forgotten 
that he was only a first lieutenant, or else he was 
amusing himself at his modest subordinate's expense. 

" I know of several men in our regiment who are just 
what I want," replied Somers, hardly able to speak from 
embarrassment, on account of the general's often-repeated 
mistake. 



 

" Very well : you shall have the necessary authority 
to select whom you please. You may go now, and 
arrange your plans." 

Somers saluted the general, and was about to retire, 
when the thought occurred to him that he might at least 
gratify his friend Captain de Banyan, and perhaps bring 
him favorably to the general's notice. 

" May I be allowed to select an officer to go with 
me ? " he asked. 

" Certainly, if you desire ; but you will remember 
that you are a young officer, going out on difficult and 
dangerous service, and that officers will not- be so 
obedient as privates," suggested the general. "Whom 
do you desire to go with you?" 

" Captain de Banyan, of our regiment." 

" Captain ! Why, then he will be your equal in rank, 
and, by priority of commission, your superior." 

" We shall agree remarkably well, general, though he 
is my superior in rank, without regard to dates," replied 
Somers, who by this time had come to the conclusion 
that the general meant something by calling him 
captain. 

" No : you are both captains," added the general with 
apparent indifference. 

" I beg your pardon, general : you have probably forgotten
that the commission which was forwarded to me 
only about two weeks ago was that of first lieutenant." 



 

" I remember all about it, Captain Somers ; but, by 
the time you reach your quarters, there will be another 
commission there for you. By the way, captain, do you 
remember Senator Guilford ? " 

" I do, general : I have good reason to remember him ; 
for he takes a deep interest in my affairs," replied 
Somers, whose brown face was red with blushes. 

"Has a pretty daughter, hasn't he? Fell out of a 
railroad car and broke her arm, didn't she ? " 

" That was the only time I ever saw her, general,'' 
stammered Somers ; "and probably I shall never see her 



again."
