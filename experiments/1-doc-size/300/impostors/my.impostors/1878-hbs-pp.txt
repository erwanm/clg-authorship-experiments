"You will trust Him?"

Zeph paused a moment, then rose up with a new and different
expression in his face, and said, in a subdued and earnest voice, "I
will."

"Amen!" said the Doctor, who stood listening; and he silently grasped
the old man's hand.




CHAPTER XXXI.

THE JOY OF HARVEST.


When Zeph turned from the little red school-house to go home,
after the prayer-meeting, he felt that peace which comes after
a great interior crisis has passed. He had, for the first time
in his life, yielded his will, absolutely and thoroughly. He had
humbled himself, in a public confession of wrong-doing, before all
his neighbors, before those whom he had felt to be enemies. He
had taken the step convulsively, unwillingly, constrained thereto
by a mighty overmastering power which wrought within him. He had
submitted, without love, to the simple, stern voice of conscience
and authority--the submission of a subject to a monarch, not that
of a child to a father. Just then and there, when he felt himself
crushed, lonely, humbled and despairing, the touch of that child's
hand on his, the pleading childish face, the gentle childish voice,
had spoken to him of the love of Christ.

There are hard, sinful, unlovely souls, who yet long to be loved,
who sigh in their dark prison for that tenderness, that devotion,
of which they are consciously unworthy. Love might redeem them; but
who can love them? There is a fable of a prince doomed by a cruel
enchanter to wear a loathsome, bestial form till some fair woman
should redeem him by the transforming kiss of love. The fable is a
parable of the experience of many a lost human soul.

The religion of Christ owes its peculiar power to its revealing a
Divine Lover, the one Only Fair, the altogether Beautiful, who can
love the unlovely back into perfectness. The love of Christ has been
the dissolving power that has broken the spells and enchantments
which held human souls in bondage and has given them power to rise to
the beauty and freedom of the sons of God.

As Zeph walked homeward through the lonely stillness of the night,
again and again the words thrilled through his soul, "Christ loves
you"--and such tears as he had never wept before stood in his eyes,
as he said wonderingly, "Me--me? Oh, is it possible? Can it be?" And
Christ died for him! He had known it all these years, and never
thanked him, never loved him. The rush of new emotion overpowered
him; he entered his house, walked straight to the great family Bible
that lay on a stand in the best room of the house; it was the very
room where the coffin of his wife had stood, where he had sat, stony
and despairing, during the funeral exercises. Zeph opened the Bible
at random and began turning the leaves, and his eye fell on the
words, "Unto Him that LOVED US and washed us from our sins in his
own blood and hath made us to our God kings and priests, to him be
glory!" His heart responded with a strange new joy--a thrill of hope
that he, too, might be washed from his sins.

Who can read the awful mysteries of a single soul? We see human
beings, hard, harsh, earthly, and apparently without an aspiration
for any thing high and holy; but let us never say that there is not
far down in the depths of any soul a smothered aspiration, a dumb
repressed desire to be something higher and purer, to attain the
perfectness to which God calls it.

Zeph felt at this moment that Christ who so loved him could purify
him, could take away his pride and willfulness; and he fell on his
knees, praying without words, but in the spirit of him of old who
cried, "If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." As he prayed a great
peace fell upon him, a rest and stillness of soul such as he had
never felt before; he lay down that night and slept the sleep of a
little child.

But when next day Zeph Higgins walked into Deacon Dickenson's store
and of his own accord offered to put back the water-pipes that led
to his spring, and to pay whatever cost and damage the Deacon might
have incurred in throwing them out, there was then no manner of doubt
that some higher power than that of man had been at work in his soul.

The Deacon himself was confounded, almost appalled, by the change
that had come over his neighbor. He had been saying all his life that
the grace of God could do anything and convert anybody, but he never
expected to see a conversion like that. Instead of grasping eagerly
at the offered reparation he felt a strange emotion within himself,
a sort of choking in his throat; and now that he saw the brother
with whom he had contended yielding so unconditionally, he began to
question himself whether he had no wrong to confess on his side.

"Wal now, I expect I've ben wrong too," he said. "We ain't perfectly
sanctified, none on us, and I know I hain't done quite right, and I
hain't felt right. I got my back up, and I've said things I hadn't
orter. Wal, we'll shake hands on't. I ain't perticklar 'bout them
water-pipes now; we'll let bygones be bygones."

But Zeph had set his heart on reparation, and here was a place where
the pertinacity of his nature had an honest mission; so by help of
reference to one or two neighbors as umpires the whole loss was
finally made good and the long-standing controversy with all its
ill-feeling settled and buried forever out of sight.

The news of this wonderful change spread through all the town.

"I declar' for't," said Liph Kingsley to Bill Larkins, "this ere's a
reel thing, and it's time for me to be a-thinkin'. I've got a soul to
be saved too, and I mean to quit drinkin' and seek the Lord."

"Poh!" said Bill, "you may say so and think so; but you won't do it.
You'll never hold out."

"Don't you believe that; Christ will help you," said Zeph Higgins,
who had overheard the conversation. "He has helped me; he can help
you. He can save to the uttermost. There 'tis in the Bible--try it.
We'll all stand by ye."

A voice like this from old Zeph Higgins impressed the neighbors as
being almost as much of a miracle as if one of the gray cliffs of
old Bluff Head had spoken; but his heart was full, and he was ready
everywhere to testify to the love that had redeemed him. No exhorter
in the weekly prayer-meeting spoke words of such power as he.

The few weeks that followed were marked in the history of the town.
Everywhere the meetings for preaching and prayer were crowded.
Glazier's bar-room was shut up for want of custom, and Glazier
himself renounced the selling of liquor and became one of the
converts of the revival. For a while every member of the church in
the village acted as if the wonderful things which they all professed
to believe were really true--as if there were an immortality of glory
to be gained or lost by our life here.

The distinction between the aristocracy of Town Hill and the outlying
democracy of the farming people was merged for the time in a sense
of a higher and holier union. Colonel Davenport and Judge Gridley
were seen with Doctor Cushing in the school-houses of the outlying
districts, exhorting and praying, and the farmers from the distant
hills crowded in to the Town Hill meetings. For some weeks the
multitude was of one heart and one soul. A loftier and mightier
influence overshadowed them, under whose power all meaner differences
sunk out of sight. Such seasons as these are like warm showers that
open leaf and flower, buds that have been long forming. Everybody in
those days that attended Christian services had more or less of good
purposes, of indefinite aspiration to be better, of intentions that
related to some future. The revival brought these out in the form of
an immediate practical purpose, a definite, actual beginning in a new
life.

"Well, Mother," said Hiel Jones, "I've made up my mind to be a
Christian. I've counted the cost, and it will cost something, too. I
was a-goin' up to Vermont to trade for a team o' hosses, and I can't
make the trade I should 'a' made. If I jine the church I mean to live
up to 't, and I can't make them sharp trades fellers do. I could
beat 'em all out o' their boots," said Hiel, with rather a regretful
twinkle in his eye, "but I won't; I'll do the right thing, ef I
don't make so much by 't. Nabby and me's both agreed 'bout that. We
shall jine the church together, and be married as soon as I get back
from Vermont. I allers meant to git religion sometime--but somehow,
lately, I've felt that now is the time."

On one bright autumnal Sabbath of that season the broad aisle of the
old meeting-house was filled with candidates solemnly confessing
their faith and purpose to lead the Christian life. There, standing
side by side, were all ages, from the child to the gray-haired man.
There stood Dolly with her two brothers, her heart thrilling with
the sense of the holy rite in which she was joining; there Nabby and
Hiel side by side; there all the sons of Zeph Higgins; and there,
lastly, the gray, worn form of old Zeph himself. Although enrolled as
a church member he had asked to stand up and take anew those vows of
which he had never before understood the meaning or felt the spirit,
and thus reunite himself with the church from which he had separated.

That day was a recompense to Dr. Cushing for many anxieties and
sorrows. He now saw fully that though the old r√©gime of New
England had forever passed, yet there was still in the hands of her
ministry that mighty power which Paul was not ashamed to carry to
Rome as adequate to regenerate a world. He saw that intemperance and
profanity and immorality could be subdued by the power of religious
motive working in the hearts of individual men, taking away the
desire to do evil, and that the Gospel of Christ is to-day, as it was
of old and ever will be, the power of God and the wisdom of God to
the salvation of every one that believeth.




CHAPTER XXXII.

SIX YEARS LATER.


Six years step softly, with invisible footsteps, over the plain of
life, bearing us on with an insensible progress. Six years of winter
snows and spring thaws, of early blue-birds and pink May-flower buds
under leafy banks, of anemone, crowfoot and violet in the fields, of
apple-blossoms in the orchards, and new green leaves in the forest;
six years of dark-green summers in the rustling woods, of fire-lilies
in the meadow-lots and scarlet lobelias by the water-brooks, of roses
and lilies and tall phloxes in the gardens; six years of autumnal
golden rod and aster, of dropping nuts and rainbow-tinted forests,
of ripened grain and gathered corn, of harvest home and thanksgiving
proclamation and gathering of families about the home table to
consider the loving-kindness of the Lord:--by such easy stages, such
comings and goings, is our mortal pilgrimage marked off. When the
golden rod and aster have bloomed for us sixty or seventy seasons,
then we are near the banks of the final river, we are coming to the
time of leaving the flowers of earth for the flowers of Paradise.

The six years in Poganuc had brought their changes, not in external
nature, for that remained quiet and beautiful as ever; the same
wooded hills, with their sylvan shades and hidden treasures of fruits
and flowers, the same brown, sparkling river, where pickerel and
perch darted to and fro, and trout lurked in cool, shadowy hollows:
but the old graveyard bore an added stone or two; mounds wet with
bitter tears had grown green and flowery, and peaceable fruits of
righteousness had sprung up from harvests sown there in weeping.

As to the Parsonage and its inmates, six years had added a little
sprinkle of silver to the Doctor's head, and a little new learning
of the loving-kindness of the Lord to his heart. The fruits of the
revival gathered into his church were as satisfactory as ordinary
human weakness allows. The Doctor was even more firmly seated in
the respect and affection of his parish than in old days, when the
ministry was encompassed by the dignities and protections of law.
Poganuc was a town where an almshouse was almost a superfluous
institution, and almsgiving made difficult by the fact that there
were no poor people; for since the shutting of Glazier's bar-room,
and the reformation of a few noted drunkards, there was scarce
anybody not in the way of earning a decent and comfortable living.
Such were our New England villages in the days when its people were
of our own blood and race, and the pauper population of Europe had
not as yet been landed upon our shores.

As to the characters of our little story, they, also, had moved on a
stage in the journey of life.

Hiel Jones had become a thriving man; had bought a share in the
stage-line that ran through the town, and owned the finest team
of horses in the region. He and our friend Nabby were an edifying
matrimonial firm, comfortably established at housekeeping in a trim,
well-kept dwelling not far from the Parsonage, with lilac bushes over
the front windows, and red peonies and yellow lilies in the door-yard.

A sturdy youngster of three years, who toddled about, upsetting
matters generally, formed a large part of the end and aim of Nabby's
existence. To say the truth, this young, bright-eyed, curly-pated
slip of humanity was enough to furnish work for a dozen women, for he
did mischief with a rapidity, ingenuity and energy that was perfectly
astonishing. What small efforts the parents made in the direction of
family government were utterly frustrated by the fond and idolatrous
devotion of old Zeph, who evidently considered it the special
privilege of a grandfather to spoil the rising generation.

Scarce a day passed that Zeph was not at the house, his pockets
stuffed with apples, cakes or nuts for the boy. The old man bowed his
grey head to the yoke of youth; he meekly did the infant's will; he
was the boy's horse and cantered for him, he was a cock and crowed
for him, he was a hen and cackled for him; he sacrificed dignity and
consistency at those baby feet as the wise men of old laid down their
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

Zeph had ripened like a winter apple. The hard, snarly astringency of
his character had grown sweet and mild. His was a nature capable of a
great and lasting change. When he surrendered his will to his God he
surrendered once for all, and so the peace of God fell upon him and
kept him. He was a consistent and most useful member of the church,
and began to be known in the neighborhood by the semi-affectionate
title of "Uncle Zeph," a sort of brevet rank which indicated a
certain general confidence in his disposition to neighborly good
offices.

The darling wish of his wife's heart had been accomplished in his
eldest son Abner. He had sent him through college, sparing no labor
and no hardship in himself to give the youth every advantage. And
Abner had proved an able scholar; his college career had been even
brilliant, and he had now returned to his native place to pursue his
theological studies under Dr. Cushing.

It will be well remembered that in the former days of New England
there were no specific theological institutions, but the young
candidate for the ministry took his studies under the care of some
pastor, who directed his preparatory course and initiated him into
his labors, and this course of things once established was often
continued from choice even after institutions of learning were
founded.

The Doctor had an almost paternal pride in this offshoot that had
grown up in his parish; he taught him with enthusiasm; he took him
in his old chaise to the associations and ministerial meetings about
the State, and gave him every opportunity to exercise his gifts in
speaking.

It was a proud Sunday for old Zeph when his boy preached his
first sermon in the Doctor's pulpit. The audience in the Poganuc
meeting-house, as we have indicated, was no mean one in point of
education, ability and culture, but every one saw and commended the
dignity and self-possession with which the young candidate filled the
situation, and there was a universal approval of his discourse from
