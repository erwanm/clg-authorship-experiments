under the sense of wrong, as well as the loss of her greatest 
comfort. For two days she felt and looked forlorn ; and 
smihng now seemed to be a difficult matter. Mr. Lindsay 
happened to be remarkably busy those two days, so that he 
did not notice what was going on. At the end of them, 
however, in the evening, he called Ellen to him, and whisperingly asked what was the matter." 

" Nothing, sir," said Ellen, "only grandmother will not let 
me do something I cannot be happy without doing." 

" Is it one of the things you want to do because it is right, 
whether it is convenient or not ?" he asked smiling. Ellen 
could not smile. 

" father," she whispered, putting her face close to his, 
if you would only get grandmother to let me do it !" 

The words were spoken with a sob, and Mr. Lindsay felt 
her warm tears upon his neck. He had however far too 
much respect for his mother to say anything against her proceedings while Ellen was present ; he simply answered that 
she must do whatever her grandmother said. But when 
Ellen had left the room, which she did immediately, he took 
the matter up. Mrs. Lindsay explained, and insisted that 
Ellen was spoiling herself for life and the world by a set of 
dull religious notions that were utterly unfit for a child ; th.at 
she would very soon get over thinking about her habit of 
morning prayer, and would then do much better. Mr. Lindsay 






looked grave ; but with Ellen's tears yet wet up on his 
cheek he could not dismiss the matter so lightly, and persisted in desiring that his mother should give up the point, 
which she utterly refused to do. 

Ellen meanwhile had fled to her own room. The moon- 
light was quietly streaming in through the casement ; it 
looked to her like an old friend. She threw herself down on 
the floor, close by the glass, and after some tears, which she 
could not help shedding, she raised her head and looked 
thoughtfully out. It was very seldom now that she had a 
chance of the kind ; she was rarely alone but when she was 
busy. 

" I wonder if that same moon is this minute shining in at the 
glass door at home ? — no, to be sure it can't this minute — what 
am I thinking of? — but it was there or will be there — let me 
see — east — west — it was there some time this morning I suppose ; looking right into our old sitting-room. moon, I wish I 
was in your place for once, to look in there too ! But it is 
all empty now — there's nobody there — Mr. Humphreys 
would be in his study — how lonely, how lonely he must be ! 
O I wish I was back there with him ! — John isn't there though 
— no matter — he will be, — and I could do so much for Mr. 
Humphreys in the meanwhile. He must miss me. I wonder 
where John is — nobody writes to me; I should think some 
one might. I wonder if I am ever to see them again. he 
will come to see me surely before he goes home I — but then 
he will have to go away without me again — I am fast 
now — fast enough — but oh ! am I to be separated from them 
for ever ? Well ! — I shall see them in heaven !" 

It was a " Well" of bitter acquiescence, and washed down 
with bitter tears. 

" Is it my bonny Miss Ellen ?" said the voice of the house- 
keeper coming softly in ; — " is my baim sitting a' her lane 
in the dark ? Why are ye no wi' the rest o' the folk, Miss 
Ellen?" 

" I like to be alone, Mrs. Allen, and the moon shines in 
here nicely." 

" Greeting !" exclaimed the old lad), drawing nearer, — " I
ken it by the sound o' youi* voice ; — greeting eenow ! Are 
ye no weel, Miss Ellen ? What vexes my bairn ? but your 
father would be vexed an he kenned it !" 







" Never mind, Mrs. Allen," said Ellen ; " I shall get over 
it directly ; don't say anything about it." 

" But I'm wae to see ye," said the kind old woman, 
stooping down and stroking the head that again Ellen had 
bowed on her knees ; — " will ye no tell me what vexes ye ? Ye 
suld be as blithe as a bird the lang day." 

" I can't, Mrs. Allen, while I am away from my friends." 

" Frinds ! and wha has mair frinds than yoursel, Miss Ellen, 
or better frinds ? — father and mither and a' ; where wad ye 
find thae that will love you mair." 

" Ah, but I haven't my brother !" sobbed Ellen. 

" Your brither. Miss Ellen ? An' wha's he ?" 
He's everything, Mrs. Allen ! he's everything I I shall 
never be happy without him ! — never ! never !" 

" Hush, dear Miss Ellen ! for the love of a' that's gude ; — . 
dinna talk that gate ! and dinna greet sae ! your father wad 
be sair vexed to hear ye or to see ye." 

I cannot help it," said Ellen ; — "it is true." 

" It may be sae ; but dear Miss Ellen, dinna let it come to 
your father's ken ; ye're his very heart's idol ; he disna merit 
auglit but gude frae ye." 

" I know it, Mrs. Allen," said Ellen weeping, and so I do 
love hira — better than anybody in the world, except two. 
But oh !, I want my brother ! — I don't know how to be happy 
or good either without him. I want him all the while." 

" Miss Ellen, I kenned and loved your dear mither weel 
for mony a day — will ye mind if I speak a word to her 
bairn ?" 

" No, dear Mrs. Allen — I'll thank you ; — did you know 
my mother ?" 

" Wha suld if I didna? she was brought up in my arms, 
and a dear lassie. Ye're no muckle like her. Miss Ellen ; — 
ye're mair bonny than her ; and no a' thegither sae frack ; — 
though she was douce and kind too." 

" I wish" — Ellen began, and stopped. 

" My dear bairn, there is Ane abuve wha' disposes a 
things for us ; and he isna weel pleased when his children 
fash themselves wi' his dispensations. He has ta'en and 
placed you here, for your ain gude I trust, — I'm sure it's 
for the gude of us a', — and if ye haena a' things ye wad 







wish, Miss Ellen, ye hae Him ; dinna forget that my ain 
bairn." 

Ellen returned heartily and silently the embrace of the old 
Scotchwoman, and when she left her, set herself to follow 
her advice. She tried to gather her scattered thoughts and 
smooth her ruffled feehngs, in using this quiet time to tho 
best advantage. At the end of half an hour she felt like 
another creature ; and began to refresh herself with softly 
singing some of her old hymns. 

The argument which was carried on in the parlor sunk at 
length into silence without coming to any conclusion. 

" Where is Miss Ellen ?" Mrs. Lindsay asked of a servant 
that came in. 

" She is up in her room, ma'am, singing." 

" Tell her I want her." 

"No — stop," said Mr. Lindsay; — "I'll go myself." 

Her door was a little ajar, and he softly opened it without 
disturbing her. Ellen was still sitting on the floor before the 
window, looking out through it, and in rather a low tone 
singing the last verse of the hymn Rock of Ages." 

WTiile I draw this fleeting breath, — 
When my eyelids close in death, — 
When I rise to -worlds unknown, 
And behold thee on thy throne, — 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me. 
Let me hide myself in thee ! 

Mr. Lindsay stood still at the door. Ellen paused a minute, 
and then sung " Jerusalem my happy home." Her utter-ance was so distinct that he heard every word. He did not 
move till she had finished, and then he came softly in. 

" Singing songs to the moon, Ellen ?" 

Ellen started and got up from the floor. 

" No sir ; I was singing them to myself." 

" Not entirely, for I heard the last one. Why do you 
make yourself sober singing such sad things ?" 

" I don't, sir ; they are not sad to me ; they are delightful. 
I love them dearly." 

" How came you to love them ? it is not natural for a child 
of your age. What do you love them for, my little daughter ?" 

" sir, there are a great many reasons, — I don't know how 
many." 





"I will have patience, Ellen ; I want to hear them all." 

" I love them because I love to think of the things the 
hymns are about, — I love the tunes, dearly, — and I like both 
the words and the tunes better, I believe, because I have 
sung them so often with friends." 

" Humph ! I guessed as much. Isn't that the strongest 
reason of the three ?" 

" I don't know sir ; I don't think it is." 

" Is all your heart in America, Ellen, or have you any left 
to bestow on us ?" 

" Yes sir." 

" Not very much !" 

"I love you, father," said Ellen, laying her cheek gently 
alongside of his. 

" And your grandmother, Ellen ?" said Mr. Lindsay, 
clasping his arms around her. 

" Yes sir." 

But he well understood that the " yes" was fainter. 
" And your aunt ? — speak, Ellen." 

" I don't love her as much as I wish I did," said Ellen ; — 
" I love her a little I suppose. why do you ask me such 
a hard question, father ?" 

" That is something you have nothing to do with," said 
Mr. Lindsay half laughing. " Sit down here," he added, 
placing her on his knee, " and sing to me again." 

Ellen was heartened by the tone of his voice, and pleased 
with the request. She immediately sang with great spirit a 
little methodist hymn she had learned when a mere child. 
The wild air and simple words singularly suited each other. 

Canaan — bright Canaan — 

I am bound for the land of Canaan. 

O Canaan ! it is my happy, happy home— 
lamboundfor the land of Canaan. 

" Does that sound sad, sir ?" 

" Why yes, — I think it does, rather, Ellen. Does it make 
you feel merry ?" 

" Not merry, sir, — it isn't merry ; but I like it very much." 
" The tune or the words ?" 
" Both, sir." 

" What do yon mean by the land of Canaan ?" 
" Heaven, sir." 




And do you like to think about that ? at your age ?" 
" Why certainly, sir ! Why not ?" 
" Why do you ?" 

" Because it is a bright and happy place," said Ellen 
gravely ; — where there is no darkness, nor sorrow, nor death, 
neither pain nor crying ; — and my mother is there, and my 
dear Alice, and my Saviour is there ; and I hope I shall be 
there too." 

"You are shedding tears now, Ellen." 

" And if I am, sir, it is not because I am unhappy. It 
doesn't make me unhappy to think of these things — it makes 
me glad ; and the more I think of them the happier I am." 

" You are a strange child. I am afraid your grandmother 
is right, and that you are hurting yourself with poring over 
serious matters that you are too young for." 

" She would not think so if she knew," said Ellen sighing. 
I should not be happy at all without that, and you would 
not love me half so well, nor she either. father," she exclaimed, pressing his hand in botli her own and laying her 
face upon it, — " do not let me be hindered in that ! forbid me 
anything you please, but not that ! the better I learn to 
please my best Friend, the better I shall please you." 

"Whom do you mean by 'your best friend?' "
