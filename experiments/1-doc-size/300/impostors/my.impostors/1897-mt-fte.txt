that matter. He said it was wingless, but a swift runner. 
The natives used to ride it. It could make forty miles an 
hour, and keep it up for four hundred miles and come out 
reasonably fresh. It was still in existence when the railway 
was introduced into New Zealand ; still in existence, and 
carrying the mails. The railroad began with the same schedule 
it has now : two expresses a week — time, twenty miles an 
hour. The company exterminated the moa to get the mails. 

Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels, the 
naturalist said that the coniferous and bacteriological output of 
Australasia was remarkable for its many and curious depart- 
ures from the accepted laws governing these species of tuber- 
cles, but that in his opinion Nature's fondness for dabbling in 
the erratic was most notably exhibited in that curious combina- 
tion of bird, fish, amphibian, burrower, crawler, quadruped, and 
Christian called the Ornithorhyncus — grotesquest of animals, 
king of the animalculae of the world for versatility of character 
and make-up. Said he — 

"You can call it anything you want to, and be right. It is a fish, for it 
lives in the river half the time ; it is a land animal, for it resides on the land 
half the time ; it is an amphibian, since it likes both and does not know which 
it prefers ; it is a hybernian, for when times are dull and nothing much going 
on it buries itself under the mud at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates 
there a couple of weeks at a time ; it is a kind of duck, for it has a duck-bill 
and four webbed paddles ; it is a fish and quadrliped together, for in the 
water it swims with the paddles and on shore it paws itself across country with 
them ; it is a kind of seal, for it has a seal's fur ; it is carnivorous, herbivorous, 
insectivorous, and vermifuginous, for it eats fish and grass and butterflies, 
and in the season digs worms out of the mud and devours them ; it is clearly 

a bird, for it lays eggs, 
and hatches them ; it is 
clearly a mammal, for it 
nurses its young ; and it 
is manifestly a kind of 
Christian, for it keeps the 
Sabbath when there is 
anybody around, and 
when there isn't, doesn't. 
It has all the tastes there 
are except refined ones, 
it has all the habits there 
are except good ones. 

"It is a survival — a 
survival of the fittest. 
Mr. Darwin invented the 
theory that goes by that 
name, but the Ornitho- 
rhyncus was the first to 
put it to actual experi- 
ment and prove that it 
could be done. Hence it 
should have as much of 
the credit as Mr. Darwin 
It was never in the Ark ; 
you will find no mention 
of it there ; it nobly 
stayed out and worked the 
theory. Of all creatures 
in the world it was the 
only one properly equip- 
ped for the test. The 
Ark was thirteen months 
afloat, and all the globe 
submerged ; no land visi- 
ble above the flood, no 
vegetation, no food for a 
mammal to eat, nor water 
for a mammal to drink ; 
for all mammal food was 
destroyed, and when the 
pure floods from heaven 
and the salt oceans of the 
earth mingled theirwaters 
and rose above the moun- 
tain tops, the result was 
a drink which no bird or 


beast of ordinary construction could use and live. But this combination was 
nuts for the Ornithorhyncus, if I may use a term like that without offense. Its 
river home had always been salted by the flood tides of the sea. On the face of 
the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were floating. Upon these the 
Ornithorhyncus voyaged in peace ; voyaged from clime to clime, from hemis- 
phere to hemisphere, in contentment and comfort, in virile interest in the con- 
stant change of scene, in humble thankfulness for its privileges, in ever-in- 
creasing entlmsiam in the development of the great theory upon whose 
validity it liad staked its life, its fortunes, and its sacred honor, if I may use 
such expressions without impropriety in connection with an episode of this 
nature. 

"It lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of independent 
means. Of things actually necessary to its existence and its happiness not a 
detail was wanting. "When it wished to walk, it scrambled along the tree- 
trunk ; it mused in the shade of the leaves by day, it slept in their shelter by 
night ; when it wanted the refreshment of a swim, it had it ; it ate leaves 
when it wanted a vegetable diet, it dug under the bark for worms and grubs; 
when it wanted tish it caught them, when it wanted eggs it laid them. If the 
grubs gave out in one tree it swam to another ; and as for fish, the very opu 
lence of the supply was an embarrassment. And finally, when it was thirsty it 
smacked its chops in gratitude over a blend that would have slain a crocodile. 

"When at last, after thirteen months of travel and research in all the 
Zones it went aground on a mountain-summit, it strode ashore, saying in its 
heart, ' Let them that come after me invent theories and dream dreams about 
the Survival of the Fittest if they like, but I am the first that has done it ! 

" This wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other 
Australian hydrocephalous invertebrates, to an age long anterior to the advent 
of man upon the earth ; they date back, indeed, to a time when a causeway 
hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, joined Australia to 
Africa, and the animals of the two countries were alike, and all belonged to 
that remote geological epoch known to science as the Old Red Grindstone 
Post-Pleosaurian. Later the causeway sank under the sea ; subterranean con- 
vulsions lifted the African continent a thousand feet higher than it was before, 
but Australia kept her old level In Africa's new climate the animals neces- 
sarily began to develop and shade off into new forms and families and species, 
but the animals of Australia as necessarily remained stationary, and have so 
remained until this day. In the course of some millions of years the African 
Ornithorhyncus developed and developed and developed, and sluffed off 
detail after detail of its make-up until at last the creature became wholly dis- 
integrated and scattered. Whenever you see a bird or a beast or a seal or an 
otter in Africa you know that he is merely a sorry surviving fragment of that 
sublime original of whom I have been speaking — that creature which was 
everything in general and nothing in particular — the opulently endowed e 
pluribus unum of the animal world. 

" Such is the history of the most hoary, the most ancient, the most vener- 
able creature that exists in the earth today — Ornithorhyncus Platypus Ex- 
traordinariensis — whom God preserve ! " 

When he was strongly moved he could rise and soar like 
that with ease. And not only in the prose form, but in the 
poetical as well. He had written many pieces of poetry in his 
time, and these manuscripts he lent around among the passen- 
gers, and was willing to let them be copied. It seemed to me 
that the least technical one in the series, and the one which 
reached the loftiest note, perhaps, was his 

INVOCATION. 

"Gome forth from thy oozy couch, 
O Ornithorhyncus dear ! 
And greet with a cordial claw 
The stranger that longs to hear 

"From thy own own lips the tale 
Of thy origin all unknown: 
Tliy misplaced bone where flesh should be 
And flesh where should be bone ; 

" And fishy fin where should be paw, 
And beaver-trowel tail, 
And snout of beast equip'd with teeth 
"Where gills ought to prevail. 

"Come, Kangaroo, the good and true ! 
Foreshortened as to legs, 
And body tapered like a churn, 
And sack marsupial, i' fegs, 

"And tells us why you linger here. 
Thou relic of a vanished time, 
When all your friends as fossils sleep,  
Immortalized in lime ! " 

Perhaps no poet is a conscious plagiarist ; but there seems 
to be warrant for suspecting that there is no poet who is not 
at one time or another an unconscious one. The above verses 
are indeed beautiful, and, in a way, touching; but there is a 
haunting something about them which unavoidably suggests 
the Sweet Singer of Michigan. It can hardly be doubted that 
the author had read the works of that poet and been im- 
pressed by them. It is not apparent that he has borrowed 
from them any word or yet any phrase, but the style and swing 


and mastery and melody of the Sweet Singer all are there. 
Compare this Invocation with " Frank Dutton " — particularly 
stanzas first and seventeenth — and I think the reader will feel 
convinced that he who wrote the one had read the other : * 



'Frank Dutton was as fine a lad 

As ever you wish to see, 
And he was drowned in Pine Island Lake 

On earth no more will he be. 
His age was near fifteen years, 

And he was a motherless boy, 
He was living with his grandmother 

When he was drowned, poor boy. 



XVII. 

" He was drowned on Tuesday afternoon, 

On Sunday he was found, 
And the tidings of that drowned boy 

Was heard for miles around. 
His form was laid by his mother's side, 

Beneath the cold, cold ground. 
His friends for him will drop a tear 

When they view his little mound." 





CHAPTEK IX. 

It is your human environment that makes climate. 

— Puddnhead Wihwi's New Calendar. 

SEPT. 15 — Night. Close to Australia now, Sydney 50 
miles distant. 
That note recalls an experience. The passengers 
were sent for, to come up in the bow and see a fine sight. It 
was very dark. One could not follow with the eye the surface 
of the sea more than fifty yards in any direction — it dimmed 
away and became lost to sight at about that distance from us. 
But if you patiently gazed into the darkness a little while, 
there was a sure reward for you. Presently, a quarter of a 
mile away you would see a blinding splash or explosion of 
light on the water — a flash so sudden and so astonishingly bril- 
liant that it would make you catch your breath ; then that 
blotch of light would instantly extend itself and take the cork- 
screw shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent, 
with every curve of its body and the " break " spreading away 
from its head, and the wake following behind its tail clothed 
in a fierce splendor of living fire. And my, but it was coming 
at a lightning gait ! Almost before you could think, this mon- 
ster of light, fifty feet long, would go flaming and storming 
by, and suddenly disappear. And out in the distance whence 
he came you would see another flash ; and another and 
another and another, and see them turn into sea-serpents on 
the instant ; and once sixteen flashed up at the same time and 
came tearing towards us, a swarm of wiggling curves, a mov- 
ing conflagration, a vision of bewildering beauty, a spectacle 

of fire and energy whose equal the most of those people will 
not see again until after they are dead. 

It was porpoises — porpoises aglow with phosphorescent 
light. They presently collected in a wild and magnificent 
jumble under the bows, and there they played for an hour, 
leaping and froUicking and carrying on, turning summersaults 
in front of the stem or across it and never getting hit, never 
making a miscalculation, though the stem missed them only 
about an inch, as a rule. They were porpoises of the ordinary 
length — eight or ten feet — but every twist of their bodies 
sent a long procession of united and glowing curves astern. 
That fiery jumble was an enchanting thing to look at, and we 
stayed out the performance ; one cannot have such a show as 
that twice in a lifetime. The porpoise is the kitten of the 
sea ; he never has a serious thought, he cares for nothing but 
fun and play. But I think I never saw him at his winsomest 
until that night. It was near a center of civilization, and he 
could have been drinking. 

By and by, when we had approached to somewhere within 
thirty miles of Sydney Heads the great electric light that is 
posted on one of those lofty ramparts began to show, and in 
time the little spark grew to a great sun and pierced the firm- 
ament of darkness with a far-reaching sword of light. 

Sydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends 
some miles like a wall, and exhibits no break to the ignorant 
stranger. It has a break in the middle, but it makes so little 
show that even Captain Cook sailed by it without seeing it. 
Near by that break is a false break which resembles it, and 
which used to make trouble for the mariner at night, in the 
early days before the place was lighted. It caused the memo- 
rable disaster to the Duncan Dunbar  one of the most pathetic 
tragedies in the history of that pitiless ruffian, the sea. The 
ship was a sailing vessel ; a fine and favorite passenger packet, 

commanded by a popular captain of high reputation. She was 
due from England, and Sydney was Waiting, and counting the 
hours ; counting the hours, and making ready to give her a 
heart-stirring welcome; for she was bringing back a great 
company of mothers and daughters, the long-missed light and 
bloom of life of Sydney homes; daughters that had been 
years absent at school, and mothers that had been with them 
all that time watching over them. Of all the world only India 
and Australasia have by custom freighted ships and fleets with 
their hearts, and know the tremendous meaning of that
