composition was a hunting frieze, modelled, in which were 
introduced fanciful combinations of leaf and scroll work, dogs, 
hunters, and children. Figures of 'almost every animal and 
plant were modelled ; the drawings and modellings from mem- 
ory were wonderful, and showed, in* their combination, great 
richness of fancy. Scattered about the room were casts of 
the best classic figures of the Louvre, placed there, as M. 
Belloc gracefully remarked, not as models, but as inspirations, 
to cultivate the sense of beauty. 

I was shown, moreover, their books of mathematical 
studies, which looked intricate and learned, but of which I 
appreciated only the delicate chirography. u And where," 
said I, " are these young mechanics taugh to read and write ? " 
" In the brothers' schools," he said. Paris is divided into 
regular parishes, centring round different churches, and con- 
nected with each church is a parochial school, for boys and 
girls, taught by ecclesiastics and nuns. 

With such thorough training of the sense of beauty, it may 
be easily seen that the facility of French enthusiasm in esthet- 
ics is not, as often imagined, superficial pretence. The nerves 
of beauty are so exquisitely tuned and strung that they must 
thrill at every touch. 

One sees this, in French life, to the very foundation of soci- 
ety. A poor family will give, cheerfully, a part of their bread 
money to buy a flower. The idea of artistic symmetry per- 
vades every thing, from the arrangement of the simplest room 
to the composition of a picture. At the chateau of Madame 
V. the whiteheaded butler begged madame to apologize for 
the central flower basket on the table. He " had not had time 
to study the composition." 

The English and Americans, seeing the French so serious 



and intent on matters of beauty, fancy it to be mere affectation. To be serious on a barrel of flour, or a bushel of 
potatoes, we can well understand ; but to be equally earnest 
in the adorning of a room or the " composition " of a bouquet 
seems ridiculous. But did not He who made the appetite for 
food make also that for beauty ? and while the former will 
perish with the body, is not the latter immortal ? With all 
New England's earnestness and practical efficiency, there is a 
long withering of the soul's more ethereal part, — a crushing 
out of the beautiful, — which is horrible. Children are born 
there with a sense of beauty equally delicate with any in the 
world, in whom it dies a lingering death of smothered desire 
and pining, weary starvation. I know, because I have felt it. 

One in whom this sense has long been repressed, in coming 
into Paris, feels a rustling and a waking within him, as if the 
soul were trying to unfold her wings, long unused and mildewed. Instead of scorning, then, the lighthearted, mobile, 
beauty-loving French, would that we might exchange instructions with them — imparting our severer discipline in religious lore, accepting their thorough methods in art; and, 
teaching and taught, study together under the great Master 
of all. 

I went with M. Belloc into the gallery of antique sculpture. 
How wonderful these old Greeks ! What set them out on 
such a course, I wonder — anymore, for instance, than the 
Sandwich Islanders ? This reminds me to tell you that in the 
Berlin Museum, which the King of Prussia is now finishing 
in high style, I saw what is said to be the most complete 
Egyptian collection in the world; a whole Egyptian temple, 
word for word — pillars, paintings, and all; numberless sarcophagi, and mummies ad nauseam I They are no more fragrant than the eleven thousand virgins, these mummies ! and 
my stomach revolts equally from the odor of sanctity and of 
science. 

I saw there a mummy of a little baby ; and though it was 
black as my shoe, and a disgusting, dry thing, nevertheless 
the little head was covered with fine, soft, auburn hair. Four 
thousand years ago, some mother thought the poor little thing 
a beauty. Also I saw mummies of cats, crocodiles, the ibis, 
and all the other religious bijouterie of Egypt, with many cases 
of their domestic utensils, ornaments, &c. 

The whole view impressed me with quite an idea of bar- 
barism ; much more so than the Assyrian collection. About 
the winged bulls there is a solemn and imposing grandeur; 
they have a mountainous and majestic nature. These Egyp- 
tian things give one an idea of inexpressible ungainliness. 
They had a clumsy, elephantine character of mind, these 
Egyptians. There was not wanting grace, but they seemed 
to pick it up accidentally ; because among all possible forms 
some must be graceful. They had a kind of grand, mammoth 
civilization, gloomy and goblin. They seem to have floun- 
dered up out of Nile mud, like that old, slimy, pre-Adamite 
brood, the what's-their-name — megalosaurus, ichthyosaurus, 
pterodactyle, iguanodon, and other misshapen abominations, 
with now and then wreaths of lotus and water lilies round 
their tusks. 

The human face, as represented in Assyrian sculptures, is 
a higher type of face than even the Greek : it is noble and 
princely ; the Egyptian faces are broad, flat, and clumsy. If 
Egypt gave birth to Greece, with her beautiful arts, then truly 
this immense, clumsy roc's egg hatched a miraculous nest of 
loves and graces. 





Among the antiques here, my two favorites are Venus de 
Milon, which I have described to you, and the Diane Chas- 
seresse : this goddess is represented by the side of a stag ; 
and so completely is the marble made alive, that one seems to 
perceive that a tread so airy would not bend a flower. Every 
side of the statue is almost equally graceful. The small, 
proud head is thrown back with the freedom of a stag ; there 
is a gay, haughty self-reliance, an airy defiance, a rejoicing 
fulness of health and immortal youth in the whole figure. 
You see before you the whole Greek conception of an immor- 
tal — a creature full of intellect, full of the sparkle and elixir 
of existence, in whom the principle of life seems to be crystal- 
lized and concentrated with a dazzling abundance ; light, airy, 
incapable alike of love and of sympathy ; living for self, and self 
only. Alas for poor souls, who, in the heavy anguish of life, 
had only such goddesses to go to ! How far in advance is 
even the idolatry of Christianity ! how different the idea of 
Mary from the Diana ! 

Yet, as I walked up and down among these remains of 
Greek art, I could not but wonder at the spectacle of their 
civilization : no modern development reproduces it, nor ever 
can or will. It is well to cherish and make much of that 
ethereal past, as a specimen of one phase of humanity, for it 
is past forever. Those isles of Greece, with their gold and 
purple haze of light and shadow, their exquisite, half-spiritual, half-bodily formation — islands where flesh and blood 
became semi-spiritual, and where the sense of beauty was an 
existence — have passed as a vision of glory, never to return. 
One scarcely realizes how full of poetry was their mythology ; 
all successive ages have drawn on it for images of beauty 
without exhausting it ; and painters and artists, to this day, 




are fettered and repressed by vain efforts to reproduce it. 
But as a religion for the soul and the heart, all this is vain and 
void ; all powerless to give repose or comfort. One who should 
seek repose on the bosom of such a mythology is as one who 
seeks to pillow himself on the many-tinted clouds of evening ; 
soft and beautiful as they are, there is nothing real to them but 
their dampness and coldness. 

Here M. and Madame Belloc entered, and as he wanted 
my opinion of the Diane, I let her read this part of the letter 
to him in French. You ought to have seen M. Belloc, with 
tears in his eyes, defending the old Greeks, and expounding 
to me, with all manner of rainbow illustrations, the religious 
meanings of Greek mythology, and the morale of Greek 
tragedy. Such a whole souled devotion to a nation dead 
and gone could never be found but in France. 

Madame Belloc was the translator of Maria Edgeworth by 
that lady's desire ; corresponded with her for years, and still 
has many of her letters. Her translation of Uncle Tom has 
to me all the merit and all the interest of an original composition. In perusing it I enjoy the pleasure of reading the story 
with scarce any consciousness of its ever having been mine. 
In the evening Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall called. They are 
admirably matched — he artist, she author. The one writes 
stories, the other illustrates them. Madame M. also called. 
English by birth, she is a true Parisienne, or, rather, seems to 
have both minds, as she speaks both languages, perfectly. Her 
husband being a learned Oriental scholar, she, like some other 
women enjoying similar privileges, has picked up a deal 
of information, which she tosses about in conversation, 
in a gay, piquant manner, much as a kitten plays with a pin 
ball. 







Madame remembers Mesdames Recamier and De Stael, 
and told me several funny anecdotes of the former. Madame 
R., she said, was always coquetting with her own funeral ; con- 
versed with different artists on the arrangements of its details, 
and tempting now one, now another, with the brilliant hope of 
the " composition " of the scene. Madame M. offered me her 
services as cicerone to Paris, and so to-day out we went — 
first to the Pantheon, of which, in her gay and piquant style, 
she gave me the history. 

Begun first in the time of Louis XVI. as a church, in the 
revolution its destination was altered, and it was to be a tem- 
ple to the manes of great men, and accordingly Rousseau, Vol- 
taire, and many more are buried here. Well, after the revo- 
lution, the Bourbons said it should not be a temple for great 
men, it should be a church. The next popular upset tipped it 
back to the great men again ; and it staid under their jurisdiction until Louis Napoleon, who is very pious, restored it to 
the church. It is not possible to say how much further this 
very characteristic rivalry between great men and their Creator is going to extend. All I have to say is, that I should 
not think the church much of an acquisition to either party, 
lie that sitteth in the heavens must laugh sometimes at what 
man calls worship. This Pantheon is, as one might suppose 
from its history, a hybrid between a church and a theatre, and 
of course good for neither — purposeless and aimless. The 
Madeleine is another of these hybrid churches, begun by 
D'lvry as a church, completed as a temple to victory by Napoleon, and on second thoughts, re-dedicated to God. 

After strolling about a while, the sexton, or some official of 
the church, asked us if we did not want to go down into the 
vaults below. As a large party seemed to be going to do 







the same, I said, " O, yes, by all means ; let us see it out." 
Our guide, with his cocked hat and lantern, -walked ahead, 
apparently in a flow of excellent spirits. These caverns 
and tombs appeared to be his particular Ibrte, and he mag- 
nified his office in showing them. Down stairs we went, 
none of us knowing what we wanted to see, or why. Our 
guide steps forth, unlocks the gates of Hades, and were enter a 
dark vault with a particularly earthy smell. Bang ! he 
shuts the door after him. Clash ! he locks it ; now we are in 
for it! and elevating his lantern, he commences a deafening 
proclamation of some general fact concerning the very unsa- 
vory place in which we find ourselves. Of said proclamation 
I hear only the thundering " Voila " at the commencement. 
Kext he proceeds to open the doors of certain stone vaulted 
chambers, where the great men are buried, between whose 
claims and their Creator's there seems to be such an uncertainty in France. TTell, here they were, sure enough, maintaining their claim by right of possession. 

" Voila le tombeau de Rousseau ! " says the guide. All 
walked in piously, and stood to see a wooden tomb painted red. 
At one end the tomb is made in the likeness of little doors, 
which stand half open, and a hand is coming out of them 
holding a flambeau, by which it is intimated, I suppose, that 
Rousseau in his grave is enlightening the world. After a short 
proclamation here, we were shown into another stone chamber 
with " Voila le tombeau de Voltaire ! " This was of wood also, 
very nicely speckled and painted to resemble some kind of 
marble. Each corner of the tomb had a tragic mask on it, 
with that captivating expression of countenance which belongs 
to the tragic masks generally. There was in the room a 
marble statue of Voltaire, with that wiry, sharp, keen, yet 




 



somewhat spiteful expression which his busts commonly 
have. 

But our guide has finished his prelection here, and is striding off in the plenitude of his wisdom. Now we are shown a 
long set of stone apartments, provided for future great men. 
Considering the general scarcity of the article in most countries, these sleeping accommodations are remarkably ample. 
Nobody need be discouraged in his attempts at greatness in 
Paris, for fear at last there won't be room to bury him. After 
this we were marched to a place where our guide made a long 
speech about a stone in the floor — very instructive, doubtless, 
if I had known what it was : my Parisian friend said he spoke 
with such a German accent she could not understand ; so we 
humbly took the stone on trust, though it looked to the eye of 
sense quite like any other. 

Then we were marched into a part of the vault celebrated 
for its echo. Our guide here outdid himself; first we were 
commanded to form a line en militaire with our backs to the 
wall. Well, we did form en militaire. I did it in the innocence of my heart, entirely ignorant of what was to come 
next. Our guide, departing from that heroic grandeur of manner which had hitherto distinguished him, suddenly commenced 
screaming and hooting in a most unparalleled style. The echo 
was enough to deafen one, to be sure, and the first blast of it 
made us all jump. I could think of nothing but Apollyon 
amusing himself at the expense of the poor pilgrims in the 
valley of the shadow of death ; for the exhibition was persisted 
in with a pertinacity inscrutable to any wisdom except his own. 
It ended by a brace of thumps on the wall, each of which 
produced a report equal to a cannon ; and with this salvo of 
artillery the exhibition finished. 







This worthy guide is truly a sublime character. Long may 
he live to show the Pantheon; and when he dies, if so disagreeable an event must be contemplated, may he have the 
whole of one of these stone chambers to himself ; for nothing 
less could possibly contain him. He regretted exceedingly 
that we could not go up into the dome ; but I had had enough 
of stair climbing at Strasbourg, Antwerp, and Cologne, and 
not even the prospect of enjoying his instructions could 
tempt me.
