going to help him." 

" If you really want to help me, I'll tell you what 
you can do," said Lawry. 

"What's that?" 

" You can run the ferry." 

"Run the ferry!" exclaimed Ben. "Why, I know 
more about steamboats than you and your engineer 
put together. Do you suppose I'm going to run a 
ferry-boat when there's a job of this sort on hand ? " 

" You can help more in this way than in any 
other," persisted Lawry. 

" Run a ferry-boat ! " sneered Ben ; " that isn't 
my style." 

" We don't need any help on the steamer." 

" Yes, you do. At any rate, I'll go down and see 
what you are about." 

" If you would only take care of the ferry, you 
would help me ever so much, Ben," added Lawry. 

" I don't see it," said the older brother, as he rose 



 

from the table, and followed Lawry out of the 
house. 

Ben was not to be shaken off so easily. When 
the pilot and engineer took their places in the bateau, 
he lighted his pipe, and took a seat on the platform, 
entertaining the boys with an animated description 
of his abilities as a " steamboat man." There was 
nothing he did not know, and there was no position 
he was not competent to fill. When the ferry-boat 
reached the Goblins, he stepped upon the raft, and 
proceeded to inspect the machinery used in sub- 
merging the casks. 

" What's that rock for ? " he demanded, pointing 
to the sinker which lay on the skids. 

" To sink the casks with," replied Ethan ; and he 
explained the process by which the hogsheads were 
attached to the hull of the Woodville. 

" Well, Lawry, if you had been studying seven 
years to get up the stupidest thing that could be 
thought of, you could not have got up a more ridicu- 
lous idea than this," said Ben, laughing contempt- 
uously. 

" How would you raise her ? " asked Lawry, 
 







quietly, though his cheeks burned at the words of 
his brother. 

" Well, I wouldn't do it in this way, I can tell you. 
If you want me to take this job in hand for you, I'll 
do it. You might as well try to raise the Goblins as 
the steamer in this way." 

"It is very easy to condemn the method," added 
Ethan, indignantly ; " but it isn't so easy to find a 
better one." 

" You say you don't want any help from me," said 
Ben, who believed that he had impaired the confi- 
dence of the young engineers in their method. 

" If you can tell me any better way, I should like 
to hear it," replied Lawry. 

" If you want me to raise your steamer, say the 
word." 

" Let me know how you intend to do it, first," 
persisted Lawry, who had carefully considered sev- 
eral methods of accomplishing the work, and finally 
adopted the only one within the compass of his 
means. " It's easier to talk than it is to do." 

"You're smart, Lawry; but you can't raise the 
steamer with those casks in seven years." 



 

" I'll have her on the top of the water by to. 
morrow night," said the young pilot. 
" No, you won't." 

" You see ! But we must go to work, Ethan." 

" That's just my idea," said the engineer, as he 
threw off his coat, and jumped into the wherry to 
bring out another cask from the boom. 

" Then you don't want me to do the job ? " added 
Ben, evidently disappointed to find he had not 
produced the impression he intended. 

" No, I think not," replied Lawry, rather coldly. 

" I think my way is the best." 

" Perhaps it is ; but I don't know what your 
way is." 

" I'll tell you, Lawry, for I don't like to have you 
waste your time and strength doing nothing ; besides, 
we want the steamer as soon as we can get her, or 
the season will be over." 

" What do you mean by we, Ben ? " asked Lawry, 
quietly. 

" Why, you and me, of course. I know something 
about steamers, and perhaps I should be willing to 
go captain of your boat, if you ever get her into 
working order." 



, 



" Perhaps you would," answered Lawry, greatly 
refreshed by this cool proposit-on. 

" Of course you mean to use the boat for the 
benefit of the family, now the old man is jugged, 
and can't do anything more for them." 

" To be sure I do." 

" I'm willing to do my part ; and as I'm older than 
you, and know all about steamboats, it would be a 
good deal more fitting for me to take charge of the 
boat than for you to do it. You can be the pilot, 
and the other fellow can be the engineer." 

" And we can both of us have the privilege of 
obeying your orders," laughed Lawry. 

" Well, I shouldn't be likely to interfere with you; 
your place would be in the wheel-house." 

" And yours in the cabin, Captain Wilford. I 
can't stop to talk about this now. There comes 
Ethan with the cask." 

" You might as well stop this foolish work first 
as last," sneered the would-be captain of the Wood- 
ville. " I was going to tell you how to raise her." 

"Go on ; we'll hear you, and work at the same 
time," said Ethan, as they rolled the hogshead upon 



 

the raft, where Lawry proceeded to put on the 
slings. 

" I should get two of those canal boats, having 
about eight feet depth of hold," continued Ben. 

" Where would you get them ? " demanded Lawry. 

" Get them ? Hire them, of course. You can get 
plenty of them at Port Henry." 

" Have you any money in your pocket ? " 

" They wouldn't cost more than fifty or a hundred 
dollars," 

" I haven't got even fifty dollars," said Lawry. 
" They would trust you on the security of your 
steamer." 

" I don't want to be trusted for any such purpose. 
What would you do with your canal boats when you 
had got them ? " asked Lawry, who knew perfectly 
well what plan his brother was about to propose. 

" I would moor one on each side of the steamer, 
put a couple of timbers across them, pass a chain 
under the bow and stern of the sunken hull, and 
make fast to the timbers. Then I would let the 
water into the canal boats, and sink them down to 
the rails. When I got them down as deep as I 



 



HASTE ANB WASTE, OR 



could, I would tighten the chains, till they bore taut 
on the timbers. Do you u.nderstand it, Lawry ? " 

" Certainly ; I know all about the plan," replied 
the young pilot, with a smile. 

" I don't believe you do," said Ben, incredulously. 
" What would you do next ? " 

*' Pump the water out of the two canal boats, 
which would take about two days' time," 

" You could rig extra pumps." 

" Three of us, with three puinps, couldn't pump 
them out in two days." 

" Well, the job is done when you have pumped 
them out." 

" When you get the water out of the boats, you 
will have raised the steamer but three or four feet 
at most." 

" Six feet, at least, for the canal boats will come 
up where they were before." 

" No, they won't ; the weight of the steamer will 
press them down two or three feet." 

An excited discussion followed upon this question ; 
but Lawry and Ethan carried their point. It was 
plain that the buoyant powers of the two boats, as 



 

the water was pumped out of them, would raise the 
steamer three or four feet, leaving her suspended 
half way between the surface and the bottom of the 
lake. Lawry wanted the aspirant for the captaincy 
of the Woodville to tell him what he would do next, 
for she could not be repaired while she was under 
water ; but Ben was " nonplussed," and unable to 
answer. 

" I can finish that job for you," said Lawry, 
smiling at the weakness of his brother. 

" She could be moored on the ways, and then 
hauled up." 

" Perhaps she might, but I should rather put her 
on the ways from the top of the water. When I got 
her three feet from the bottom, I should move her 
towards the shore till she grounded." 

" What then ? " asked Ben. 

" I should sink the canal boats again, pump them 
out once more, and thus raise her three feet more ; 
but it would take about three days every time we 
lifted her three feet. Ben, I think we could get 
her to the top of the water in about a fortnight by 
your plan. By mine, I shall have her up by to- 
morrow night." 



 



" I'll bet you won't ; or in a month either. You 
know too much, Lawry," said Ben, disgusted at the 
confidence of his brother.
