The soft silk morning dress ; the delicate laces, rumpled but 
still beautiful ; the diamond shining on her finger ; the ear 
rings and brooch of pearl that suited so well her lovely com 
plexion, and she was glad she had stung her with that one 
word, "pauper!" 

"Papa ! Are you quite sure ?" in a slow, dazed way. 

"Am I sure?" 

The ponderous jaw seemed to bite off the word in indignation. 

Then Sylvia was kneeling at her feet, crying with a kind of 
hysteric passion 

"Oh, Mrs. McRae, take me to him! Poor papa, whom 
we have thought dead so long, so long ! He used to love me 
so dearly, and call me his little Sylvia, and hold me on his 
knee.- Oh, is it true ? You are not mistaken ?" 

The eyes were wide open with feverish light, and the dry 
lips quivered piteously. 

"Then you did not know " 

''Know! How should I? Why did he not come here/ 
Oh papa, poor, friendless, and dying !" and a sob choked her 
voice. 

"Child," Janet McRae said, softening, " get yourself ready, 
and let us go. We have not a moment to lose. " 

Sylvia changed her dress, and smoothed her soft shining hair. 
Her tern pies throbbed, for the old ache had returned, and every 
nerve in her body felt strained at the shock, though she could 
hardly credit the tidings. But to go away under Janet McRae 's 
strong wing almost promised liberty. Ah, little did she guess 
how it was to come. 

" I must write a note for mamma. I think they will bring 
her over immediately, if she is not too tired." 

Mrs. McRae's lips curled. Might there not be something 
besides fatigue ? 

Sylvia was ready presently. She slipped her hot, throbbing, 
ungloved hand within the one so cool and calm, whose life had 



 

been like a broad, placid river. An infinite pity stole into the 
great stern heart for this poor little girl, with all her hideously 
brilliant prospects. Oh, how could a mother thus sacrifice her 
child, wed her to a base, unprincipled profligate ? for already 
there had been more than one wild story afloat concerning 
Eustace Gilliat. But it was the way of the world. Truth, un 
stained honor, and manhood counted for nothing against gold, 
and having that, vice was glossed over. 

When Mrs. McRae's first heat of prejudice began to subside 
she scanned Sylvia's face more narrowly perhaps to find the 
traces of vanity and self-love that could feed upon this glitter 
ing prospect. 

The smooth outline of pink and pearly flesh was worn and 
sharpened a little ; the careless girl's mouth, with its brilliant 
smiles and small petulancies, had been shaped into something 
noble, tender, and patient. No one but herself would ever 
know the pains that had cultured it to a finer heritage than 
mere physical beauty, a positive strength quite capable of ex 
erting itself in any great strait, yet veiled and tempered by some 
sad knowledge that had dawned too soon over this young soul. 
And in the drooping eyes there was strange dreariness, as if 
she had sounded the hollowness of the rocks whereon she ex 
pected to place her feet, and found that some black, dangerous 
current swept through the interstices beneath. And then the 
great sympathetic heart warmed to her, as it had used to the 
little child she held upon her knee. 

"They shall not blight her whole life," she mused inwardly. 
" She is better and finer than I thought. Some drops of gold 
have mingled with the weak white clay her parents had to 
give her." 

"Tell me about papa," Sylvia said presently, in a broken 
voice. 

"There is not much, my dear," and the tone softened un 
consciously. "I saw him for a mere half-hour. But you 
shall have that little." 



 

"Victor Hurst was very kind," after the story had ended. 
" Poor, poor papa ! You do not think he could have come to 
St. Albans?" 

Even as she spoke a conscious shiver sped through her 
pulses. She had learned so much of her mother's petty weak 
ness, false pride, and numerous little subterfuges that were 
hardly truth. And if she had believed it would interfere with 
her social standing, or the luxuries she deemed so essential 
to her well-being ah, she was her mother still, and it was 
cruel so to judge her. 

"It is very probable, my dear;" in a dry, hard tone. She 
could not excuse Margaret Redmond's weak, narrow, pleasure- 
loving nature. 

There was no word spoken after that. The ponies were 
flecked with foam long ere they reached the quarry and saw the 
old watch-tower of Cragness standing on its hill, with the 
higher one behind keeping guard in its purple-gray afternoon 
haze. 

Mrs. Hurst came out to meet them. She took Sylvia in her 
arms and kissed the tired face. Motherly caresses came so 
natural to this woman. 

" You must rest a little," she said, in her cooing, persuasive 
voice. " Here is a plate of peaches and cream, it will refresh 
you." 

She took off Sylvia's hat, brought a napkin wet in fresh 
lavender water, and softly wiped the heat and dust from the 
fevered skin. Here was a cluster of Malmaison roses in a tall, 
slender vase, and a spray or two of heliotrope diffusing its 
pungent odor. If Sylvia dared but lay her head on this tender 
bosom and cry noiselessly until the bitter ache in her heart 
tvas washed away ! 

"Now take me to him, please." 

She passed Victor in the hall. At the door Mrs. Hurst drew 
back. 

" Come, " Sylvia entreated. " I think you will pity, judge 




mercifully. All these careless years I have thought him dead, 
you know ;" as if to justify her past volatile girlhood. 

She went up to the bed with a strange awe. She had never 
seen anything so wan and weak, so pinched and sunken. It 
was as if you might read a story of genteel hunger, privation, 
and loneliness in every line of the face. The lips had shrunken 
to a mere thread. 

He was dozing and dreaming, but the respirations were so 
short and feeble, the greenish pallor so marked. 

"Let me see her only once, Margaret !" the gasping voice 
murmured faintly. "My little Sylvia ! If I could have one 
kiss from her fresh young lips I might give her up to this 
lover, who is not worthy of her, Margaret, not worthy !" 

" Papa !" The voice was curiously steady, for in that brief 
instant she had decided her fate anew. Did God demand that 
she should wreck her own soul for another's bodily comfort 
and satisfaction ? 

" Papa, I am here, little Sylvia !" 

She bowed until her soft curls brushed against his cheek. 
She kissed the cold lips, took the wasted hands in hers. 

A quiver ran through his frame with the power and agony 
of a mortal spasm. He glanced wildly at her and rolled his 
head feebly upon the pillow. 

' ' No, it is not Sylvia. Margaret, you deceive me. Sylvia 
has gone with her young lover." 

"I could not always remain little as when I sat upon your 
knee and pulled your soft beard about, or listened to stories of 
beautiful brave queens, of kings and knights and crusaders. 
But I remember the long evenings at cousin Braisted's, when 
mamma would be ill upon the sofa, and we sat and studied 
the fire, built castles and palaces and flame-pictures such as 
no artist ever painted. Look at me, dear. It is the child 
grown into the woman, but the child's heart still aches for 
the empty years out of which you have fallen. Papa I 
Papa !" 



 

The pathetic cry, the voice strong and sad as death itself, 
shook the centre of his unbelief. The eyes stared with 
spasmodic brightness, the hands clutched at her garments. 

"And through all these years, when I have thought of you 
as being at rest in heaven, I have treasured up all the old 
remembrances, the walks we used to take, the poems you 
taught me, the books we read together. Ah, why did you not 
come sooner ? Why did you linger desolate and forlorn, when 
your child's heart would have been full of tender love for 
you." 

She buried her face in the pillow and sobbed softly. Ah, it was 
well that she was never to know the sufferings of those years. 
The long illness in a hospital, from whence had come the 
rumor of his death ; his hesitation to announce himself when 
he found that his wife had been received into her father's house; 
his weak ambition to do something that would give him the 
success other men gained ; the struggles, the defeats, the drear 
nights in miserable attics, trying to extract from his confused 
and wandering brain brilliant ideas that never even came ; days 
when he had hovered at the doors and gratings of restaurants 
for a little warmth and savory odor to appease his hunger. A 
poor, weak, but proud and honorable gentleman, pushed to 
the wall by the stronger ones. Perhaps a true woman's love 
ir.ight have imparted stamina, encouraged and brightened ; but 
when Margaret Redmond came to the dregs of poverty, she 
could do nothing but bemoan her own sad fate. 

He touched the soft cheek with his finger, that shook like a 
stray leaf in a November blast, caught feebly at the floating 
curls, and then smiled. 

"Yes, it is Sylvia !" 

She uttered a wild little cry, for she thought him dying. 
Mrs. Hurst came and bathed the pallid face, and chafed the 
cold hands. 

"Don't leave me!" he entreated, pitifully, grasping at the 
air. 



 

"No, I shall not. Dear, dear papa !" 

Afterward he dozed again. The room began to be shrouded 
in twilight, and when Mrs. Hurst brought in a lamp she begged 
her to leave it on the hall-table. She sat on the bed's side now, 
talking sweet and slow, and listening to the broken sentences, 
kissing the wrinkled cheek, the straggling hair, and the cold 
hands that began to grow mysteriously useless. All the vehe 
ment child's love came back to her. She had never been 
ashamed of him in those old days, for there was no pride to 
be stung by unsuccess. And now that he was dying, the 
chivalrous girl's heart, so much finer and nobler than any of 
them had dreamed, would have covered sins as well as mistakes 
and failures, and kissed down the fluttering eyelids that none 
might see their secret. 

The frail life floated on and on. Trewartha came and 
looked at him and whispered softly "At midnight." Janet 
McRae wandered up and down as if held by some curious 
spell ; but Anah Hurst was strangly sweet and tranquil. 

Sometime after the night had set in, and fitful gusts were 
blowing blue-black drifts about the pale moon-tinted sky, they 
heard a sound of furious driving that stopped at the door, and 
then a rather thick, imperious voice demanding "Miss Red 
mond." 

Sylvia shivered with mental anguish and shame 

Presently Victor came up-stairs. 

" Your mother is ill," he said, "and in great alarm. She 
has sent for you. " 

Sylvia Redmond straightened her slight figure, though her 
face was deathly white. But her tone was clear and untrem- 
bling. 

"Tell Eustace Gilliat that my place is here, at my father's 
side, until God frees me. Even if it were otherwise, I could 
not return with him to-night" 

Victor remarked the convulsive shiver. Ah, how could she 
have given that despicable creature any power over her ? 



 

' ' But your mother ?" 

" Mamma will understand. I think I am right ;" with slow 
hesitation, glancing into his eyes. 

"You are right." He could not help but utter the words, 
for if she had been willing he must have kept her from the 
questionable journey. 

"Ask him to take my love and sympathy to mamma. She 
has kind friends, and he needs me."
