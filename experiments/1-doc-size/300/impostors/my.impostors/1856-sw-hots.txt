took it up and looked out, but in all bright nature she could
find nothing which did not side against her. She got up and
walked the room; then she sat down and began to consider what
arrangements would be necessary, and what would be possible.
Then confessed to herself that it would not be all bad to have
somebody to break her solitude, even anybody; then got over
another qualm of repugnance, and drew the table near her and
opened her desk.


Shahweetah, Sept. 26, 1817.

"Dear Rose,

"I am all alone, like you. Will you come here and let us do
the best we can together? I am at a place you don't like, but
I shall not stay here all the time, and I think you can bear
it with me for a while. I shall have things arranged so as to
make you as comfortable as you can be in such straitened
quarters, and expect you will come as soon as you can get a
good opportunity. Whether you come by boat or not, part of the
way, you will have to take the stage-coach from Pimpernel
here; and you must stop at the little village of Mountain
Spring, opposite Wut-a-qut-o. From there you can get here by
wagon or boat. I can't send for you, for I have neither one
nor the other.

"Yours truly, dear Rose,

"Elizabeth Haye."


With the letter in her hand, Elizabeth went forth to the
kitchen.

"Karen, is there any sort of a cabinet-maker at Mountain
Spring?"

"What's that?" said Karen.

"Is there any sort of a cabinet-maker at the village? -- a
cabinet-maker, -- somebody that makes tables and bedsteads, and
that sort of thing?"

"A furnitur' shop?" said Karen.

"Yes -- something of that kind. Is there such a thing in
Mountain Spring?"

Karen shook her head.

"They don't make nothin' at Mountain Spring."

"Where do the people get their tables and chairs? where do
they go for them?"

"They go 'most any place," said Karen; -- "sometimes they goes
to Pimpernel, -- and maybe to Starlings, or to Deerford; they
don't go much nowheres."

"Can I get such things at Pimpernel?"

"If you was there, you could, I s'pose," said Karen.

"Could Anderese get a horse and cart at the village, to go for
me?"

"I guess he can find a wagon round somewheres," said Karen.
"You couldn't go in a cart handy."

"I! -- no, but I want to send him, to fetch home a load of
things."

"How'll he know what to get?"

"I will tell him. Couldn't he do it?"

"If he knowed what was wanted, he could," said Karen. "Me and
him 'll go, Miss Lizzie, and we'll do it."

"You, Karen! I don't want to send you."

"Guess I'll do the best," said the old woman. "Anderese
mightn't know what to fetch. What you want, Miss Lizzie?"

Elizabeth thought a moment whether she should ask Winthrop to
send up the things for her; but she could not bear to do it.

"I want a bedstead, Karen, in the first place."

"What sort'll a one?"

"The best you can find."

"That'll be what'll spend the most money," said Karen
musingly.

"I don't care about that, but the nicest sort you can meet
with. And a bureau --"

"What's that?" said Karen. "I dun' know what that means."

"To hold clothes -- with drawers -- like that in my room."

"A cupboard?" said Karen; -- "some sort like that?"

"No, no; I'll shew you what I mean, in my room; it is called a
bureau. And a washstand -- a large one, if you can find it. And
a rocking-chair -- the handsomest one that can be had."

"I know them two," said Karen. "That'll be a load, Miss
Lizzie. I don't b'lieve the wagon 'll hold no more."

"The first fine day, Karen, I want you to go."

"The days is all fine, I speck, hereabouts," said Karen.
"We'll start as quick as Anderese gets a wagon."

"Who's comin', Miss 'Lizabeth?" said Clam as she met her young
lady coming out of the kitchen.

"I don't know -- possibly Mrs. Haye. I wish all things to be in
readiness for her."

"Where'll she sleep, Miss 'Lizabeth," said Clam with opening
eyes.

"Here."

"Will she have this for her bedroom? -- And what'll you do,
Miss 'Lizabeth?"

"If she comes, we will eat in the kitchen." And with the
thought the young lady stepped back.

"I forgot -- Karen, do you think the wagon will hold no more?
Anderese must get a large one. I want a few neat chairs --
plain ones -- cane-bottomed, or rush-bottomed will do; I want
them for this room; for if this lady comes we shall have to
take this for our eating-room. I don't want a table; we can
make this do; -- or we can take the one I use now; but we want
the chairs."

"Well, Miss Lizzie, you'll have to have 'em -- we'll manage to
pile 'em on someways."

And Miss Haye withdrew.

"Ain't this a start now?" said Clam after she had rubbed her
knives in silence for several minutes. "Didn't I tell you so?"

"Tell what?" said Karen.

"Why! that Miss 'Lizabeth couldn't keep quiet more'n long
enough to get her spunk up. What in the name of variety is she
at work at now!"

"What's the matter with you?" grumbled Karen.

"Why I tell you," said Clam facing round, "them two love each
other like pison!"

"That's a queer way to love," said Karen.

"They hate each other then -- do you understand me? they hate
so, one wouldn't thaw a piece of ice off the other's head if
it was freezin' her!"

"Maybe 'tain't jus' so," said Karen.

"What do you know about it!" said Clam contemptuously.

"What do you, perhaps?" suggested Karen.

"I know my young lady," said Clam rubbing her knives, "and I
know t'other one. There ain't but one person in this world
that can make Miss 'Lizabeth keep her fire down -- but she does
have an idee of mindin' him."

"Who's that?" said Karen.

"Somebody you don't know, I guess," said Clam.

"If 'twas all true, she wouldn't want her here," said Karen.

"It's all true," said Clam, -- "'cept the last. You don't know
nothin', Karen. We'll see what a time there'll be when she
comes. Eat in here! --"

"She's eat in here afore now -- and I guess she can again,"
said old Karen, in a tone of voice which spoke her by no means
so discomposed as Clam's words would seem to justify.

Perhaps Elizabeth herself had a thought or two on the close
quarters which would be the infallible result of Mrs. Haye's
seizure of the old 'keeping-room.'

The twenty-seventh, spite of Karen's understanding of the
weather, was a rainy day. The twenty-eighth, Karen and
Anderese went to Pimpernel on their furniture hunting, and
came back at night with the articles, selected somewhat in
accordance with a limited experience of the usual contents of
a cabinet-maker's warehouse. The very next day, Elizabeth set
Anderese to foisting out and putting together her little old
boat, the Merry-go-round. Putting together, literally; she was
dropping to pieces from the effects of years and confinement.
Anderese was hardly equal to the business; Elizabeth sent for
better help from Mountain Spring, and watched rather eagerly
the restoring of her favourite to strength and beauty. Watched
and pressed the work, as if she was in a hurry. But after
tightening and caulking, the boat must be repainted. Elizabeth
watched the doing of that; and bargained for a pair of light
oars with her friend the workman. He was an old, respectable-
looking man, of no particular calling, that appeared.

"Where was this here boat built?" he inquired one day as he
was at work and Elizabeth looking on.

"It was built in Mannahatta."

"A good while ago, likely?"

"Yes, it was."

"Did this here belong to old Squire Landholm?"

"No."

"'Twa'n't fetched here lately, I guess, was it?"

"No -- it has lain here a long time."

"Who did it belong to, then?"

"It belonged to me."

"Is it your'n now?" said the man looking up at her.

"No," said Elizabeth colouring, -- "it is not; but it belongs
to a friend of mine."

"Was you ever in these parts before?"

"Some time ago."

"Then you knew the old family, likely?"

"Yes, I did."

"There was fine stuff in them Landholms," said the old man,
perhaps supplied with the figure by the timber he was nailing,
-- "real what I call good stuff -- parents and children. There
was a great deal of good in all of 'em; only the boys took
notions they wouldn't be nothin' but ministers or lawyers or
some sort o' people that wears black coats and don't have to
roll up their trowsers for nothin'. They were clever lads,
too. I don't mean to say nothin' agin 'em."

"Do you know how they're gettin' on?" he asked after a pause
on his part and on Elizabeth's.

"I believe Asahel is with his father, -- gone West."

"Ay, ay; but I mean the others -- them two that went to
College. I ha'n't seen Rufus for a great spell -- I went down
and fetched up Winthrop when his mother died."

"Will you have paint enough to finish that gunwale?"

"Guess so," said the old man looking into his paint-pot.
"There's more oil in the bottle. What be them two doing now?
Winthrop's a lawyer, ain't he?"

"Yes."

"Well, he's made a smart one, ha'n't he? -- ain't he about as
smart as any one they've got in Mannahatta?"

"I'm not a judge," said Elizabeth, who could not quite keep
her countenance. "I dare say he is."

"He was my favourite, always, Winthrop was, -- the Governor, as
they called him. Well -- I'd vote for him if he was sot up for
that office -- or any other office -- if they'd do it while I'm
above ground. Where is he now? -- in Mannahatta?"

"Yes."

"Where's t'other one -- the oldest -- Rufus -- where's he?"

"I don't know where he is. How soon will this do to be put in
the water, Mr. Underhill?"

"Well -- I guess it'll want somethin' of a dryin' fust. You can
get along without it till next week, can't you?"

"Next week! and this is Tuesday! --"

"Yes -- will you want it afore that? It hadn't ought to be put
in the water one day afore Monday -- if you want it to look
