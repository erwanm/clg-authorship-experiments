the figure remained perfectly quiet, I concluded that these 
whites had discovered a means of preserving their great 
men after death, that they might be offered up as sacrifices 
to the good spirits. Awed and terrified, I sat still until 




  

my master awoke, and sent me away, to my great joy, for 
I was but ill at ease with these people, who appeared to 
me to live in an atmosphere of unholy magic. At this 
place they called me Jacob; on board of the vessel they 
had called me Michael, but my real name at home was 
Olandah Equiand. 

Tn this miserable situation, where I had no one to speak 
with, life became every day more burdensome, and I should 
certainly have died of grief if the Almighty had not 
pleased to deliver me from such distress. A young man 
came one day to see my master on business, and saw me by 
chance in the house ; I pleased him, and he bought me for 
about four pounds. He was, as I learned afterwards, a 
lieutenant in the British navy, but was at present com- 
manding a merchant vessel, which was anchored further 
down the river. An elderly negro immediately took me 
before him on horseback — a new and most delightful way 
of travelling to me, and carried me down the river's bank 
to where the beautiful vessel lay at anchor. I was carried 
on board, and we soon set sail. 

My fortune had now taken the most favorable turn ; I 
had a hammock, in which I slept, and had plenty to eat 
and drink ; every one on board treated me kindly, very 
differently from any of the other whites whom I had seen, 
and I began to think that they were not all of the same 
stamp. I had already learnt a few words of Enghsh, and 
after we had been several days upon the sea, I inquired of 
one and another where we were going. Some told me, either 
to make sport of me or from a desire to please me, that 
they were going to take me to my home ; this gave me the 




greatest delight ; I thought over all the wondrous things I 
should have to relate to my father and mother. But I 
was soon undeceived and learned that we were sailing for 
England, the birth place of my master. He named me 
Gustavus Vasa, and although I remonstrated as well as I 
could, and told him that I wished to he called Jacob as 
before, he told me shortly that it was to be as he said, and 
always called me Gustav. At first I pretended not to 
hear and thus suffered many a box on the ear, but at last 
I reconciled myself to being called Gustav. 

The ship was delayed by contrary winds and the voyage 
wan uncommonly long ; of course the rations grew smaller, 
and at last each man was restricted to a pound and a half 
of bread, about as much meat, and a can of water. The 
whole time that we were at sea we saw no other vessel, 
and only once caught a few fish. Some of the sailors and 
the captain said to me in joke, that they should have to kill 
Rnd eat me, and in my simplicity, I took it all for earnest ; 
grew very melancholy, and feared that each moment would 
be my last. While I was in this distress the sailors caught 
a large fish, and I was delighted, for I felt sure that they 
would eat it before they killed me; but to my consterna- 
tion, they only cut off a piece of the tail, and threw the 
fish back into the water. I was now more anxious than 
ever; I was indeed afraid that these whites, whom I could 
not understand, wpuld kill and eat me. 

There was on board a young man about four years older 
than I, named Eichard. He was an American by birth, had 
been very well educated, and was of a most amiable dispo- 
sition. Before I had been many days on- board he showed 


quite a liking for me, and I became very warmly attached 
to him. The friendship commenced on this voyage con- 
tinued as long as we knew each other, and never can I 
forget the faithful friend who, at the age of fifteen, pos- 
sessed a soul superior to prejudice, and did not disdain to 
be the teacher and companion of a poor ignorant negro 
slave. 

Once a man fell overboard in the night, and as they 
stopped the vessel, such a noise and confusion ensued that 
my great terror returned; as I ceuld not understand what 
was going on, I felt convinced that they were about to 
sacrifice me to the spirit of the wavys, which were very 
high and stormy, for I could never believe that these 
whites were not arch-magicians. I did not close my eyes 
through the whole night, and although I was somewhat 
relieved when the daylight appeared, yet when ever I waa 
called, I imagined that I must prepare for death. 

Soon afterwards we met several very large fishes, which, 
as I afterwards learned, were called whales ; as it was just 
beginning to grow dark when they came in sight, they 
looked particularly frightful as they spouted up the water 
so that the deck was sprinkled. I believed them to be the 
rulers of the sea, and angry that the white men had made 
no sacrifice. I was strengthened in this belief by a sudden 
lull in the wind, which I was sure was occasioned by the 
fishes, and fearing lest I should be immediately sacrificed, I 
concealed myself on, the forward deck. My friend Richard 
soon came to find me, and I asked him what those fishes 
were, and what they wanted. As my English was very 
imperfect T could scarcely make myself intelligible to him; 



still less could he comprehend me when I asked whether 
they were about to offer a sacrifice to the fishes; he told 
me that these fishes could easily swallow a man, and this 
was enough to terrify me almost to death. Before I could 
procure any further information the captain called Richard, 
and they stood talking and looking at the fishes, while the 
crew were busied setting fire to a tar barrel, which they 
were going to throw out to the fishes for sport. Eichard 
told the captain of the fright I was in, and I was called, 
trembling and weeping, firmly convinced that my last hour 
was at hand. They made game of me and my terrors for 
a while, and then let me go, and threw the burning barrel 
into the water; as it was a very dark night the fishes 
were attracted by the blazing light, and to my unspeaka- 
ble joy we saw no more of them.

My fears entirely vanished when at last, after a tedious 
voyage of thirteen weeks, we came in sight of land, and 
anchored at Falmouth. All on board rejoiced, and cer- 
tainly, no one more than I. The captain immediately went 
ashore and sent us fresh provisions, which we were really 
in need of. We fell to without delay, and a long feast 
succeeded our weary fast. 

IV. 

When I arrived in England I was twelve years old ; I 
beheld with astonishment the large buildings and paved 
streets of Falmouth ; every thing that I saw increased my 
wonder. One morning when I went on deck I found it 
covered with Vhite spots ; as I had never seen any thing 
like it before. I ran to the helmsman and informed him that 



during the night some one had strewn the deck with salt. 
He immediately perceived my ridiculous mistake, and 
asked me to bring him some of the salt. I gathered a 
handful of it, but felt a strange sensation of cold, and 
when he asked me to taste of it, my amazement exceeded 
all bounds. I asked him what it was, but could not under- 
stand when he told me snow. He inquired if we had not 
the same in our country ; I said no, and curiously asked 
who made it ; he replied that a great man in heaven, called 
Ood, made it, and I was again puzzled and in the dark, 
 especially as I now saw the whole air filled with the white 
fQOw flakes. 

Some days after our arrival, I went with several of the 
crew to church, and as I had never been in such a place 
before, my curiosity dnd wonder was unbounded. I asked 
ftbout every thing as well as I could, and was told that 
liere the God who made us and all things, was worshipped. 
t asked a thousand questions, but most of them were unin- 
telligible, or so strange that they could not be answered. 
My friend Eichard always understood me best, as well 
because I spoke to him freely and without fear, as because 
he explained every thing to me simply and with the great- 
est pleasure. What he told me about this God pleased 
me much, as far as I could understand it ; but I was par- 
ticularly pleased to see that these white people did not 
buy and sell each other, as is the custom with us blacks, 
and I concluded that in this respect they were much hap- 
pier than the negroes. The superior understanding of the 
whites, which did not escape me, filled me with admira- 
tion, and great was my astonishment when I saw that they 



never offered sacrifices to their God, and ate with unwashed 
hands. The slender form of their women struck me; I 
did not like it and thought my country women much 
handsomer. 

I had often seen my master and Richard reading, and I 
was very desirous to be able to speak with books also, and 
learn from them about every thing in the world. I often 
took a book when I was alone, spoke to it, and then held 
it to my ear to hear its reply, but as it was always per- 
fectly silent, I was extremely disappointed 

My master was stajdng in Falmouth, at the house of a 
iriend, who had a little daughter six or seven years old, 
who took a violent fancy to me, so that we were together 
all day long, took our meals together, and had the same 
servants to wait upon us. They treated me so kindly in 
this family, that I was often reminded involuntarily of thft 
happy days that I had passed in Africa with my good 
little master. After I had been in this house some time 
they took me again on board of the vessel, which wa» 
about to sail again with a fresh cargo, but the child wepl 
80 bitterly at my departure, that I was carried on shore to 
pacify her. I now began seriously to fear that they would 
marry me to her, and when my master asked me if I 
would stay with the little girl, I began to cry, and begged 
him so earnestly not to leave me behind, that they carried 
me on board again secretly by night, and on the following 
day we sailed for the island of Guernsey, on the coast of 
Normandy, whither our cargo was destined. 
' As I now lived among a people who neither disfigured 
their faces with gashes, nor filed their teeth to a point, as 



some of my former Afirican masters had done, I was glad 
that I had not complied with these foolish customs. At 
Guernsey I lived at the house of our pilot, who had several 
little boys and girls, and with them I passed many happy 
nours. I often noticed that the mother washed the chil- 
dren's faces, which then looked red as a rose, and I tried 
-epeatedly to produce the same effect upon my fece by 
washing it, but in vain. I was vexed that I never suc- 
ceeded ; I was as black as ever. The wife of the pilot 
Ireated me very gently and kindly ; she taught me as she 
Jid her own children. 

I remained several months in this pleasant home, until 
jay master, who had received an appointment as first lieutenant on a man-of-war, came for me, and carried me to 
Ciondon. We had scarcely got to the mouth of the 
Thames, when the boat of a man-of-war came alongside to 
take away our crew, for it is the custom in England, as I 
afterwards learned, when there is need of soldiers in time 
of war, to provide for it in this unjust manner. This 
business is called pressing, and the officers and men enga- 
ged in it a press-gang. Every one on board hastened to 
conceal himself. I was terribly frightened, and could not 
understand what it was all about, but I immediately crept 
behind a chicken coop ; the press-gang came on board with 
drawn swords, pulled the men out from their hiding-places, 
and threw them into the boat. At last my turn came ; 
the man who discovered me held me up in the. air by my 
legs, and they all made game of me, while I screamed and 
shrieked until the helmsman heard me, and came to my 



rescue. He did every thing to soothe me, but I was not 
satisfied until the boat rowed away. 

Soon after, to my great joy, our master carried us on 
board of his vessel, which was called " The Gazelle," and I 
was again amazed at the multitude of men and cannons 
that I saw here, but as I gained in experience, my wonder 
at what I saw decreased, and I soon lost entirely all terror 
of the white people. I went to the other extreme, and 
instead of being jfrightened at the fire-arms and weapons 
that I saw, I longed for nothing more fervently than a 
lonflict with the enemy. All anxiety of any kind van- 
fehed from my mind. I was well contented with my lot. 
There were many boys beside myself on board, and we 
were continually together, and passed most of our time in 
play. One day, all the boys were assembled on board, 
and divided into couples, that they might measure their 
strength by wrestling for the amusement of the officers. 
It was the first time that I ever received a bloody nose. I 
was greatly excited, and fought for more than an hour 
with my opponent, until we were separated, when thor- 
oughly exhausted. I now joined repeatedly in these trials 
of strength, and the captain and officers used to encourage 
me in every way to do so. 

V. 

I had learned much of a sailor's duty, and could fire off 
a cannon very readily, but had never had the good fortune 
to assist in a battle, although we had coasted along the 
French coast for a long time, and had captured seventeen 
ships, which surrendered without any resistance. We now 



returned back to Portsmouth harbor, and my master, to 
my great delight, carried me with him to the capital, 
which I had long desired to see. But my curiosity was 
destined not to be satisfied, for I had been seized with very 
painful chillblains in the cold climate to which I was so 
flnaccustomed, and they grew so much worse that I had to 
be carried to a hospital, where the evil increased to such a 
degree that the physicians feared mortification, and tried 
to persuade me to have my leg amputated ; but I obsti- 
nately refused to submit to the operation, declaring that I 
would rather die. My leg grew better at last without it. 
but just as I began to recover, I took the small-pox, and 
was obliged to keep my bed again.
