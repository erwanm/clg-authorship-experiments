list government. Farm-houses dot the valley, and 
now and then we passed villages, abounding in blonde 
girls, so rare elsewhere in Italy, but here so numer- 
ous as to give Titian that type from which he 
painted. 

At Oliero we learned not only which was the 
road to the Sette Communi, but that we were in it, 
and it was settled that we should come the next day 
and continue in it, with the custodian of the cave, 
who for his breakfast and dinner, and what else we 
pleased, offered to accompany us. We were early 
at Oliero on the following morning, and found our 
friend in waiting ; he mounted beside our driver, 
and we rode up the Brenta to the town of Valstagna 
where our journey by wheels ended, and where we 



 

were to take mules for the mountain ascent. Our 
guide, Count Giovanni Bonato (for I may as well 
give him his title, though at this stage of our prog- 
ress we did not know into what patrician care we 
had fallen), had already told us what the charge for 
mules would be, but it was necessary to go through 
the ceremony of bargain with the muleteer before 
taking the beasts. Their owner was a Cimbrian, 
with a broad sheepish face, and a heavy, awkward 
accent of Italian which at once more marked his 
northern race, and made us feel comparatively se- 
cure from plunder in his hands. He had come down 
from the mountain top the night before, bringing 
three mules laden with charcoal, and he had waited 
for us till the morning. His beasts were furnished 
with comfortable pads, covered with linen, to ride 
upon, and with halters instead of bridles, and we 
were prayed to let them have their heads in the 
ascent, and not to try to guide them. 

The elegant leisure of Valstagna (and in an Ital- 
ian town nearly the whole population is elegantly at 
leisure) turned out to witness the departure of our 
expedition ; the pretty little blonde wife of our inn- 
keeper, who was to get dinner ready against our re- 
turn, held up her baby to wish us boun viaggio, and 
waved us adieu with the infant as with a handker- 
chief; the chickens and children scattered to right 
and left before our advance ; and with Count Gio- 
vanni going splendidly ahead on foot, and the Cim- 
brian bringing up the rear, we struck on the broad 
rocky valley between the heights, and presently 



 

began the ascent. It was a lovely morning ; the sun 
was on the heads of the hills, and the shadows 
clothed them like robes to their feet ; and I should 
be glad to feel here and now the sweetness, fresh- 
ness, and purity of the mountain air, that seemed 
to bathe our souls in a childlike delight of life. A 
noisy brook gurgled through the valley ; the birds 
sang from the trees ; the Alps rose, crest on crest, 
around us ; and soft before us, among the bald peaks 
showed the wooded height where the Cimbrian vil- 
lage of Fozza stood, with a white chapel gleaming 
from the heart of the lofty grove. Along the moun- 
tain sides the smoke curled from the lonely huts of 
shepherds, and now and then we came upon one of 
those melancholy refuges which are built in the hills 
for such travelers as are belated in their ways, or 
are overtaken there by storms. 

The road for the most part winds by the brink of 
precipices, walled in with masonry of small stones, 
where Nature has not shored it up with vast mono- 
liths, and is paved with limestone. It is, of course, 
merely a mule-path, and it was curious to see, and 
thrilling to experience, how the mules, vain of the 
safety of their foothold, kept as near the border of 
the precipices as possible. For my own part, I 
abandoned to my beast the entire responsibility in- 
volved by this line of conduct ; let the halter hang 
loose upon his neck, and gave him no aid except such 
slight service as was occasionally to be rendered by 
shutting my eyes and holding my breath. The mule 
of the fairer traveler behind me was not only ambi- 



 

tious of peril like my own, but was envious of my 
beast's captaincy, and continually tried to pass him 
on the outside of the path, to the great dismay of 
the gentle rider ; while half-suppressed wails of ter- 
ror from the second lady in the train gave evidence 
of equal vanity and daring in her mule. Count 
Giovanni strode stolidly before, the Cimbrian came 
behind, and we had little coherent conversation until 
we stopped under a spreading haw-tree, half-way up 
the mountain, to breathe our adventurous beasts. 

Here two of us dismounted, and while one of the 
ladies sketched the other in her novel attitude of cav- 
alier, I listened to the talk of Count Giovanni and 
the Cimbrian. This Cimbrian's name in Italian was 
Lazzaretti, and in his own tongue Briick, which, pro- 
nouncing less regularly, we made Brick, in compli- 
ment to his qualities of good fellowship. His broad, 
honest visage was bordered by a hedge of red beard, 
and a light of dry humor shone upon it : he looked, 
we thought, like a Cornishman, and the contrast be- 
tween him and the visa sciolto, pensieri stretti expres- 
sion of Count Giovanni was curious enough. 

Concerning his people, he knew little ; but the 
Capo-gente of Fozza could tell me every thing. Va- 
rious traditions of their origin were believed among 
them ; Brick himself held to one that they had first 
come from Denmark. As we sat there under the 
spreading haw-tree, Count Giovanni and I made him 
give us the Cimbrian equivalent of some Italian 
phrases, which the curious may care to see in correspondence with English and German. Of course, 
German pronunciation must be given to the words : 

A general resemblance to German and English 
will have been observed in these fragments of Cim- 
brian, while other words will have been noticed as 
quite foreign to either. 

There was a poor little house of refreshment be- 
side our spreading haw, and a withered old woman 
came out of it and refreshed us with clear spring 
water, and our guides and friends with some bitter 
berries of the mountain, which they admitted were 
unpleasant to the taste, but declared were very good 
for the blood. When they had sufficiently improved 
their blood, we mounted our mules again, and set 
out with the journey of an hour and a quarter still 
between us and Fozza. 

As we drew near the summit of the mountain our 
road grew more level, and instead of creeping along 
by the brinks of precipices, we began to wind through 
bits of meadow and pleasant valley walled in by 
lofty heights of rock. 

Though September was bland as June at the foot 
of the mountain, we found its breath harsh and cold 
on these heights ; and we remarked that though 
there were here and there breadths of wheat, the 
land was for the most part in sheep pasturage, and 
the grass looked poor and stinted of summer warmth. 
We met, at times, the shepherds, who seemed to be 
of Italian race, and were of the conventional type 
of shepherds, with regular faces, and two elaborate 



 

curls trained upon their cheeks, as shepherds are 
always represented in stone over the gates of villas. 
They bore staves, and their flocks went before them. 
Encountering us, they saluted us courteously, and 
when we had returned their greeting, they cried with 
one voice, " Ah, lords ! is not this a miserable 
country ? The people are poor and the air is cold. 
It is an unhappy land ! " And so passed on, pro- 
foundly sad ; but we could not help smiling at the 
vehement popular desire to have the region abused. 
We answered cheerfully that it was a lovely country. 
If the air was cold, it was also pure. 

We now drew in sight of Fozza, and, at the last 
moment, just before parting with Brick, we learned 
that he had passed a whole year in Venice, where he 
had brought milk from the main-land and sold it in 
the city. He declared frankly that he counted that 
year worth all the other years of his life, and that he 
would never have come back to his native heights 
but that his father had died, and left his mother and 
young brothers helpless. He was an honest soul, 
and I gave him two florins, which I had tacitly ap- 
pointed him over and above the bargain, with some- 
thing for the small Brick-bats at home, whom he 
presently brought to kiss our hands at the house of 
the Capo-gente. 

The village of Fozza is built on a grassy, oblong 
plain on the crest of the- mountain, which declines 
from it on three sides, and on the north rises high 
above it into the mists in bleaker and ruggeder ac- 
clivities. There are not more than thirty houses in 



 

the village, and I do not think it numbers more than 
a hundred and fifty souls, if it numbers so many. 
Indeed, it is one of the smallest of the Sette Com- 
muni, of which the capital, Asiago, contains some 
thousands of people, and lies not far from Vicenza. 
The poor Fozzatti had a church, however, in their 
village, in spite of its littleness, and they had just 
completed a fine new bell tower, which the Capo- 
gente deplored, and was proud of when I praised it. 
The church, like all the other edifices, was built of 
stone ; and the village at a little distance might look 
like broken crags of rock, so well it consorted with 
the harsh, crude nature about it. Meagre meadow- 
lands, pathetic with tufts of a certain pale-blue, tear- 
ful flower, stretched about the village and southward 
as far as to that wooded point which had all day been 
our landmark in the ascent. 

Our train drew up at the humble door of the Capo- 
gente (in Fozza all doors are alike humble), and, 
leaving our mules, we entered by his wife's invita- 
tion, and seated ourselves near the welcome fire of 
the kitchen welcome, though we knew that all the 
sunny Lombard plain below was purple with grapea 
and black with figs. Again came from the women 
here the wail of the shepherds : " Ah, lords I is it not 
a miserable land ? " and I began to doubt whether 
the love which I had heard mountaineers bore to their 
inclement heights was not altogether fabulous. They 
made haste to boil us some eggs, and set them before 
us with some unhappy wine, and while we were eat- 
ing, the Capo-gente came in. 



 

He was a very well-mannered person, but had, of 
course, the bashfulness naturally resulting from lonely 
life at that altitude, where contact with the world 
must be infrequent. His fellow-citizens seemed to 
regard him with a kind of affectionate deference, and 
some of them came in to hear him talk with the 
strangers. He stood till we prayed him to sit down, 
and he presently consented to take some wine with 
us. 

After all, however, he could not tell us much of 
his people which we had not heard before. A tradi- 
tion existed among them, he said, that their ances- 
tors had fled to these Alps from Marius, and that 
they had dwelt for a long time in the hollows and 
caves of the mountains, living and burying their dead 
in the same secret places. At what time they had 
been converted to Christianity he could not tell ; 
they had, up to the beginning of the present century, 
had little or no intercourse with the Italian popula- 
tion by which they were surrounded on all sides. 
Formerly, they did not intermarry with that race, 
and it was seldom that any Cimbrian knew its lan- 
guage. But now intermarriage is very frequent ; 
both Italian and Cimbrian are spoken in nearly all 
the families, and the Cimbrian is gradually falling 
into disuse. They still, however, have books of re- 
ligious instruction in their ancient dialect, and until 
very lately the services of their church were per- 
formed in Cimbrian. 

I begged the Capo to show us some of their books, 



 

and he brought us two, one a catechism for chil- 
dren, entitled " Dar Kloane Catechism vor z' Belose- 
land vortraghet in z' gaprecht von siben Komiinen, 
un vier Halghe Gasang. 1842. Padova." The other 
book it grieved me to see, for it proved that I was 
not the only one tempted in recent times to visit 
these ancient people, ambitious to bear to them the 
relation of discoverer, as it were. A High-Dutch 
Columbus, from Vienna, had been before me, and I 
could only come in for Amerigo Vespucci's tempered 
glory. This German savant had dwelt a week in 
these lonely places, patiently compiling a dictionary 
of their tongue, which, when it was printed, he had 
sent to the Capo. I am magnanimous enough to 
give the name of his book, that the curious may 
buy it if they like. It is called " Johann Andreas 
Schweller's Cimbrisches Worterbuch. Joseph Berg- 
man. Vienna, 1855." 

Concerning the present Cimbri, the Capo said that 
in his community they were chiefly hunters, wood- 
cutters, and charcoal-burners, and that they prac- 
ticed their primitive crafts in those gloomier and
