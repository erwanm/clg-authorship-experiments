overtaken by sudden illness, and asked if I was 
faint? 

"No," I said. 

He asked if I was ill ? 

" I am not going back there again," said I. " Do 
not mind me. Only tell me which way I must go 
to get home." 

" Home ! you cannot go home alone," he said decidedly. 

"Yes. I can. I would rather. Which is the 
way? for I do not know where I am. Only put 
me in the way, and I can get home." 

"Not alone, at this hour; that is impossible. 
The performance will be over soon. Hadn't you 
better just go back and sit it out quietly ? Miss 
Forella expects you to take supper with her; she 
will be disappointed." 

"I am not going back again," said I; "either to 
supper or anything else. Leave me ; I will find my 
way." And I drew my shawl round me, and looked 
this way and that, to see if I could make out any 
thing of my whereabouts. At the instant a figure 
passed me that I was sure I knew. With a flash 
of determination I took my measures. I let the 
figure pass and get a few yards away, and then I 
broke from Mr. Francis and hurried off, running, 



 

upon the same track. He made a start to follow in, I think; but I dodged him in the ill lighted 
street; the figure ahead of me turned a corner, so 
did I turn, and my pursuer missed me. I ran, for 
the swift stride of my protector or guide was not 
otherwise to be successfully followed; it went on 
before me steady, straight and quick, and I had to 
make a few springs very much in earnest to enable 
me to catch up with him. Till I had done that, I 
had a pang of anxiety lest some fancied resem 
blance had misled me; but when I was close be 
hind him I knew I was not mistaken and all was 
right. But then immediately I began to think 
how much was not "all right," as I panted along. 
Which way was my unconscious guide leading 
me ? and how far and how long could I follow at 
this rate ? and if he was allowed to remain unconscious that I was behind him, might he not sudden 
ly go into some house and disappear and leave me 
indeed in darkness, literal and figurative? And if 
I made myself known, what ever would he think 
of me ? And meanwhile, how he walked ! I was 
losing breath again. This would never do. I 
must make myself known, at all risks, if I could. 
So I made another spring to get quite near, and 
spoke out, for I was growing desperate and spoke 
his name. 

"Mr. Iredell!" 

He did not hear, and I had to speak again and 
louder, and again. Then he stopped and turned 
I came up breathless 



 

" Mr. Iredell, could you would you be so good, 
as to walk a little slower ? " 

" Miss Burgoyne ! " he said in great astonish 
ment, " It cannot be Miss Burgoyne ? Alone ? 
How came you here ? " 

"You walked so fast," I said panting; "I could 
hardly keep up, and I had to speak to you." 

"To speak to me? " 

"Yes, for I was afraid you might get away from 
me." 

" But where are you going ? " 

"I want to go home, if I knew which way it 
is." 

"You don't know?" 

"No; I do not know at all where I am. It 
happened " 

"What has happened?" And then he offered 
his arm to me ; and I felt so glad and so ashamed, 
both at once, that I did not know what to say. 

"What has happened?" he repeated. "But, Miss 
Burgoyne, how came you here ? You are a long 
way from home." 

" If you can tell me which way to go," said I still
panting, "I will not trouble you." 

"Tell you which way to go?" said he half laughing ; " what do you mean ? Don't you know, little 
girls must not run about Philadelphia alone in the 
dark ? And how came you to lose your way ? " 

We began to walk again now, slowly, and I ob 
served my protector changed the direction of his 
steps, as well as moderated the pace of them. 



 

was greatly embarrassed what to say, or where to 
begin; with what could I begin? but I saw he 
waited for my answer. 

"I have not known my way all the evening," I 
began. "Miss Forella invited me to dine with her." 

"Miss Forella! Ah?" 

" And when I got there, to her house, I mean, 
she said she was going to take me to see a picture ; 
a great picture ; and I was very glad to go, for I 
like to see things, and I have never seen pictures 
much. So after dinner we went; she, and her 
mother, and Mr. Francis, and I." 

"To see a picture ? " 

"So she said. And I cannot tell you where we 
went, or what the name of the place is ; but it was 
a play of some sort, Mr. Iredell." 

He was silent now, listening. 

"And the house must have been a theatre, i 
never saw one before, so at the first I did not 
know. And I cannot tell you the name of the 
play, either, for it was French ; and I do not understand French by ear though I do by eye. I be 
gan not to like it, but being there I did not see 
how I could get away; so I made the best of 
circumstances ; and some of the music was very 
beautiful " 

" Music ? " said my companion. 

" Music and dancing. I did not like to be there, 
but as I could not help myself I was amused, at 
first. And then " 

I paused, but he waited. 



 

"Then, after a time, I did not like the way of 
things ; and I saw one or two looks pass between 
my companions, and I grew uneasy and suspicious ; 
and at last, I don't know what they were doing on 
the stage, but Mr. Francis put himself in front of 
us and told Miss Forella if she looked at them he 
would never bring her there again. I felt then, 
Mr. Iredell, as if I could not stay another minute. 
I burst out, and got down to the street; and Mr. 
Francis followed me, thinking I was faint; but I 
was not faint, only I could not bear to go back 
into that place again, and I would not." 

Mr. Iredell did not speak for a block or two ; and 
I wondered what he thought of me. 

" Did he, did Francis, let you come off by your 
self alone, to find the way home on foot ? " 

"Not exactly. He told me I could not do it. 
He tried to make me go back. Ought I to have 
gone back ? I could not bear to do it." 

" And he let you set off alone ? " 

" Not exactly. He would have hindered me if 
he could. I ran away. I would not be kept." 

" But you were going quite the wrong way, and 
very far from home." 

"Yes, because I " 

Here I stopped. What was I going to say? 
Such a feeling of shame came over me, as I never 
felt in my life before and hope never to feel again. 
I was silent, and Mr. Iredell was silent. This would 
not do. At last I plucked up courage. 

" Mr. Iredell, I saw you pass I was sure it was 



 

yon --and I thought you would tell me the way, 
or I could follow you rather, and I should be safe 
where you were. I did not want to speak to you 
at first ; and then you walked so fast I got a terror
of losing sight of you somehow; and then I made 
a spring and spoke your name." 

" Where did you see me pass ? " 

"At that place when Mr. Francis and I were 
standing in the street." 

"You followed me from there? You must be 
tired out," said he gently. 

" No, I am not a bit tired now," I insisted. 

" You are trembling. My dear Miss Rurgoyne, 
I might read you several lessons upon the text of 
this evening's work ; but the first thing that comes 
to me is, Do not dine with Miss Forella any more." 

"I never shall ! " 

"And the next thing is, Go to drive with me 
to-morrow afternoon." 

"That is a very pleasant lesson," I said. "Your 
teaching, considering all things, is very indulgent, 
Mr. Iredell." 

"There is no telling what I shall say to you tomorrow," said he pleasantly. And then the rest 
of the way we had a quiet nice talk, and I felt alright and quite myself when I got home. Mr. 
Iredell had been out of town, which was the reaction why he had not come for me before. 

Somehow I felt no necessity to tell my sister 
and her husband all my experiences. I was content and quiet, and had no mind to go over the 



 

whole thing again, nor to encounter their criticisms. They would be shocked at my running 
through Philadelphia streets alone, following the 
steps of somebody who did not so much as know 
of my being there; and I could not much blame 
them ! I was tempted to be shocked myself when 
I considered it. Yet I could not fancy that Mr. 
Iredell thought ill of me. All his words and man 
ner forbade me to think so. Meanwhile my brother 
and sister rather rallied me for being silent and 
meditative, and so I took up my shawl and came 
off to bed. 



Oct. 20. 

MK. IREDELL was as good as his word, and the 
weather this time did not hinder. I had my 
drive that next day, and I have had several more. 
Caroline says it is ridiculous, for Mr. Iredell to 
be taking me to drive. I cannot see why; and 
Mr. Birkenstall, when she made the remark the 
other day at table, said he could not. 

"What's the matter with Iredell?" he asked. 
"He's as fine a looking fellow as you'll easily find." 

" Looks are nothing " said Caroline. 

"Aren't they? Well, he has money enough." 

"What does he do with it? " 

" I don't know. Takes care of it, I suppose. He 
is a safe man." 

"He is close," said my sister. "He has loads, 



 

and he does nothing with it. Keeps his mother at 
that place out of town; when he might give her 
as good a house as anybody has in Philadelphia." 

" He has as good a house as anybody in Philadelphia; a beautiful old-fashioned house in Poulteney Place."
