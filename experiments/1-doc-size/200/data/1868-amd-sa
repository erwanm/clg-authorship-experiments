ways, and has evinced such a tender consideration for 
my happiness. He has youth, rare personal endowments, 
wealth, and a certain winsomeness that attracts friends on 
every side. Few would fail of being perfectly happy with 
him. Why does it nut satisfy me? 

Ah, why ? Heart, what have you done ? Why this 
wandering in gloomy places for a glance from perverse 
eyes that freeze me with their coldness? Why sip this 
draught of bitter rue while the goblet of life's sweetest 
wine stands untasted? Weak and unwomanly as it may 
be, I can confess here to myself, with no other eyes to 
witness my humiliation, that I do care for one to whom I 
am as nothing. 

He has attracted me strongly from the very sense of 
invincible power that is generous only as a conqueror ; 
and if he had striven to subdue, I think I must have 
yielded eventually, even if I had resisted at first. Once 
or twice he has carried me along the current of his im- 
petuous desires, and I have learned how sweet it was to 
yield to so superior a force. But does he care? He has 
been unjust, impatient, cruel; and that a man can never 
be to the woman he loves. Ah, dream too sweet for me ; 
the thought tortures my very being! 



 

I can never decide with any certainty upon Mr. St. 
John. A short time ago he threw me constantly in Ayl- 
mer Channing's society, never accompanied us anywhere, 
pleaded urgent business, letters to write, or persons to see ; 
and now lie lias changed inexplicably. I have a con- 
sciousness that he follows me everywhere. I catch a 
glimpse of fierce, restless eyes when I least expect ; and 
now and then he confronts rne in a manner so peculiar that 
it startles me. 

Mrs. Lawrence has had the house full of company, 
though I believe he first proposed inviting some guests. 
We have had outdoor amusements; and within, music, 
charades, tableaux, and the like. It has been quite a gala 
time ; and Aylmer lias proved a strong attraction. Mrs. 
Lawrence admires him exceedingly. 

I think he remarked this curious surveillance, for one 
morning, as we were rambling in the grounds, he spq.ke of 
it. I laughed at first. 

"He means to frighten away any possible lover by 
those portentous looks, and keep you here in his castle 
until you consent to become humble Esther to his mag- 
nificence." 

"A remarkably distant event," I replied, rather curtly. 

"I should hope so. I cannot imagine a woman loving 
him. His haughty pride, imperious will, and cold, dis- 
dainful nature, his lack of tenderness, and his utter ina- 
bility to enjoy the highest and keenest happiness, would 
repel any true woman." 

"Are you quite just?" I ventured to say, under a pas- 
sionate heart throb. 

"Just? Haven't you used your own eyes? Ah, Miss 
Adiiance, you cannot lead me very far astray in regard to 
yourself. He is barbarous to you sometimes, and you 
suffer from it as any high-toned, sensitive nature would. 



 

I know him so well that his sharp-pointed shafts never 
wound me. I forgive for relation's sake." 

Was it really his dainty, generous philosophy ? I did 
not want to misjudge one so amiable, and yet I wondered 
how deeply he could be wounded. His bright, exuberant 
nature seemed akin to a summer day with its great waves 
of sunshine, singing birds, and wafts of fragrance. How 
would it be in winter in trouble or sorrow ? 

" Of all things wonderful ! My amiable cousin coming 
to meet us I He has certainly developed a phase of jeal- 
ousy ; " and Aylmer gave a light, rippling laugh. 

I turned suddenly in a half incredulous mood. Mr. St. 
John had caught the sound. O, that bitter gesture of 
contempt, as if he could have struck some one to the 
earth ; those scornful eyes dilated and sparkling ! What 
unseen fire fed them jealousy or hate ? 

Aylmer opened the conversation in a most courteous 
manner. I debated how I could escape from them both, 
for I knew this covert peace would prove of short dura- 
tion. But when I would have left them, Mr. St. John 
Baid, pointedly, 

"Pardon my intrusion, Miss Adriance, and remain. I 
am the unlucky third." 

" My dear cousin, allow me to appease your tender con- 
science. Our ramble was most unimportant, and you were 
no interruption whatever." 

I fancy he did not like the tone, for Aylmer gave it a 
peculiar sound, and his reply was sharp. He must have 
been strangely out of humor. I was really glad when a 
turn in the walk brought us in sight of the house. 

Most of the guests had left us, and he showed a dis- 
position to retire into his former impassibility, but Aylmer 
was really tormenting with his light ridicule. St. John's 
ready wit seemed to have deserted him, for, though he 



 

was bitter, his adversary gained all the triumphs. It was 
excessively wicked ; but I really enjoyed seeing him 
vanquished. What was in those deep, mysterious eyes ? 
Great waves of something, that kept coming and going 
with phosphorescent light, showing depths and heights, 
but giving no clew to the translation thereof. 

Quite late in the evening I remember I was lingering 
over the piano, when Aylmer asked him a question about 
some musical composer. He had been making a pretence 
of reading, but did not progress very rapidly, if one 
might judge from the slowness with which the leaves 
were turned. He sat now quite unconscious, his face 
compressed with some strange, strong purpose. 

" Stuart, are you in love ? " and Aylmer's dainty lips 
gave out their musical ripple. 

He started up nervously, and shot a rapid glance 
around. 

"What foolish trifles amuse you," he said, haughtily. 

" I have asked one question half a dozen times at least. 
I know of nothing else that can render a man so oblivi- 
ous do you, Miss Adriance ? " 

"I am not experienced in such matters," I returned, 
confusedly. 

" You are, at least. A man who has a new love every 
month, must be a competent judge ! " and St. John glanced 
at him scathingly. 

" What says your poet ? " replied the other. 

' ' "Tis better to have loved and lost, 
Than never to have loved at all ; ' 

and then it^doesn't affect one so powerfully as to take 

away one's senses." 

" Some people never would suffer in that respect." 

" Stuart, you have been in a most unamiable mood all

day. Something must certainly be weighing upon your 
mind." 

"What weak, womanish nonsense!" "St. John declared, 
loftily. "Since love and its accessories suit you so ad- 
mirably, keep to your own sphere. You will find suffi- 
cient attraction in it." 

The look, as he strode out of the room, was for me. 
Scorn, anger, and derisive pity, quite as if he despised me. 
My heart was under my feet in a moment, and I know I 
repaid him glance for glance. 

"The tiger lias been caught in the toils. Bravo, Miss 
Adriance ! " Aylmer said, gayly; but I turned away, 
humiliated and pained to my inmost soul.
