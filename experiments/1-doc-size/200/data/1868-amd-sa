senior Mrs. Channing, she could not approve Aylmer's mar- 
riage cordially, and held me in some degree answerable for 
it. Besides this, she experienced a pang of secret mortifi- 
cation that, with my many advantages, I was not married. 

The weather was growing intensely warm. A great 
cloud appeared to envelop me, full of slumbrous magnetic 
influences, not sufficiently charged for a crisis. I had a 
sensation of being cut off from the rest of the world. The 
very air about me grew stifling, and I drew my breath 
with great gasps of apprehension. And in this mood I 
counted up the days, until one morning, when I heard a 
stir among the servants. 

The master of Laurehvood had come! 

There were joyous greetings in the hall, the sweet voice 
of Mrs. Lawrence murmuring a pleasant welcome. Had I 
any part or lot in the matter? Should I thrust myself 
upon his attention in this first moment of his return ? 
Pride held me back. If he was very desirous of my pres- 
ence, he might signify it. But I waited in vain for any 
summons. What little events change the purposes of our 
lives! Any time dui ing that morning I could have been 
convinced by a word or a look of the great fact of his love j 



 

when the bell rang for luncheon, the hour of grace had 
passed. I felt calm, but bitter and cold. 

I hurried down, hoping to enter the dining-room first. 
He intercepted me in the hall. Somehow, I shall always 
remember the picture he made. The voyage had com- 
pleted the work of the tropical sun, and left him almost 
swarthy. His hair had been cut quite closely, displaying 
his broad forehead, and leaving a few stray curls at the 
temple. His eyes had a set look, that was fairly stern, 
while the flowing beard, with its peculiar bronze glitter, 
gave him a weird, foreign appearance. 

He flushed deeply in spite of the olive hue, and appeared 
at the first moment absolutely disconcerted. 

" You seem in no haste to welcome me," he said, rather 
sharply. " I had been counting on that, at least." 

" Your sister had the first right, I am sure," I answered, 
gravely. 

"And you none?" This was uttered in a tone of in- 
quiry. 

" None," I repeated. 

" At least you might ask if I were well ; " and he laughed 
rather nervously. 

" The fact is apparent. Allow me to congratulate you 
upon your safe return." 

At this juncture Mrs. Lawrence joined us. She looked 
somewhat discomposed, and glanced curiously at me. My 
sensitive pride took alarm at once. Did she fear that her 
brother would foolishly rush to the rescue, and marry me? 

Each one made an effort, and the meal passed most 
pleasantly, though the conversation was all upon Mr. St. 
John's journey. He was really delighted to be at home 
again ; that I could plainly see. We lingered over our 
dessert of fruit a long while, and as we rose he said, turn- 
ing to me, 



 

"May I see you in the library, Miss Adrinnce?" 

I crossed the hall with him, and then went over to the 
window. Just here we discussed my foolish engagement 
with such bitterness. How vividly it all carne back ! 

"Miss Adriance," he began presently, "my sister has 
informed me of your misfortune. I am most sorry that I 
should be absent at such a time; but I doubt if it is as bad. 
as she thinks. You are not quite disheartened." 

" I have sufficient courage to bear a reverse of fortune," 
I said, proudly. 

" You have both been looking at the darkest side. Such 
things alarm Isabelle a good deal. She knows so little 
about business." 

Then, after a pause, seeing that I made no reply, 

"I think I understand the matter perfectly, and can as- 
sure you that your fortune is not all gone. Have you no 
faith in my assertion, that you look so incredulous?" 

" Besides the lawyer's statement, I have heard from my 
friends at Baltimore, who were anxious to soften the blow 
as much as possible. There maybe a few thousands saved, 
but even that is doubtful." 

" Half at least," he said-, walking down the room, his face 
turned partly from me. 

I imagined his motive in an instant, and though it gave 
me a quick thrill, I could not endure to be the recipient 
of his generosity. 

"Mr. St. John," I said, trying to keep the touch of ex- 
citement out of my voice, "I can understand that you con- 
sider yourself in some manner answerable for this misfor- 
tune ; but I do not hold you so. It was Mr. Anthon's 
investment, and one cannot always guard against losses. 
I am satisfied that it is nearly all gone, and have made 
some arrangements for the future." 

He paused suddenly. " What arrangements ? " he asked, 
in a sharp tone. 



 

u I have already obtained a situation ns governess. It 
is necessary that I should depend upon my own exertions, 
and this offer came to me with a very litt'e trouble." 

"Governess!" He accompanied the word with such a 
disdainful gesture that it angered me. 

'You are in haste, I think, Miss Adriance. "It is pay- 
ing a poor compliment to your friends," he went on, with 
a scornful inflection. 

"I do not propose to test friendship that far," I said, 
haughtily. "Dependence would not be pleasant for me." 

"O, you arc strong-minded. It will not harm you to 
nir your theories occasionally; but you have forgotten one 
important fact. I am still your guardian." 

'There is no longer a necessity for supervision. When 
people are at work, they seldom fall into mischief." 

"It is still tin/ duty to provide you a home, and yours 
to remain there," he said, not attempting to disguise the 
power in his tone. 

"You can insist upon this for some time longer," I re- 
turned, coldly; "but it would not be an agreeable experi- 
ment. I question if a young lady with no fortune would 
be considered a valuable acquisition to Laurel wood society." 

"That is pure pride." 

"I am proud; I confess it." 

"And willing to make everything bow to this demon !" 

His tone was bitter, unjust, I thought. 

"The demon, as you style it, will not have many wor- 
ship] ers. There is nothing to be rendered subservient." 

"Nothing!" 

lie strode up and down the room, his face clouded, his 
lips compressed, and his eyes coming to points of flame. 
Had I gone too far? At all events, I could not be a sup- 
pliant for his love, and, truth to tell, he seemed in no haste 
to offer it. 



 

"This governessing is an absurd idea," he flung' out 
angrily. 

" I see nothing so absurd in a woman having courage to 
meet any exigency, and a desire not to become a burden 
to her friends." 

" I believe friends never were very weighty considera- 
tions with you." 

The taunt was too bitter. A scarlet heat flamed up in 
my face. 

"I have consulted some friends, in whom I have confi- 
dence," and my breath as well as my words came slowly, 
for I knew this was a cruel thrust.
