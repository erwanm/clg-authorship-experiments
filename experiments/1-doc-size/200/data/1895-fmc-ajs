The young girl felt her mother's eyes upon her, looked up herself, and
smiled faintly, almost mechanically, as before. It was a sort of habit
they both had--a way of acknowledging one another's presence in the
world. But this time it seemed to Clare that there was a question in the
look, and after she had smiled she spoke.

"No," she said, "I don't understand how anybody can forget the past. It
seems to me that I shall always remember why I did things, said things,
and thought things. I should, if I lived a hundred years, I'm quite
sure."

"Perhaps you have a better memory than I," answered Mrs. Bowring. "But
I don't think it is exactly a question of memory either. I can remember
what I said, and did, and thought, well--twenty years ago. But it seems
to me very strange that I should have thought, and spoken, and acted,
just as I did. After all isn't it natural? They tell us that our bodies
are quite changed in less time than that."

"Yes--but the soul does not change," said Clare with conviction.

"The soul--"

Mrs. Bowring repeated the word, but said nothing more, and her still,
blue eyes wandered from her daughter's face and again fixed themselves
on an imaginary point of the far southern distance.

"At least," said Clare, "I was always taught so."

She smiled again, rather coldly, as though admitting that such teaching
might not be infallible after all.

"It is best to believe it," said her mother quietly, but in a colourless
voice. "Besides," she added, with a change of tone, "I do believe it,
you know. One is always the same, in the main things. It is the point of
view that changes. The best picture in the world does not look the same
in every light, does it?"

"No, I suppose not. You may like it in one light and not in another,
and in one place and not in another."

"Or at one time of life, and not at another," added Mrs. Bowring,
thoughtfully.

"I can't imagine that." Clare paused a moment. "Of course you are
thinking of people," she continued presently, with a little more
animation. "One always means people, when one talks in that way. And
that is what I cannot quite understand. It seems to me that if I liked
people once I should always like them."

Her mother looked at her.

"Yes--perhaps you would," she said, and she relapsed into silence.

Clare's colour did not change. No particular person was in her thoughts,
and she had, as it were, given her own general and inexperienced opinion
of her own character, quite honestly and without affectation.

"I don't know which are the happier," said Mrs. Bowring at last, "the
people who change, or the people who can't."

"You mean faithful or unfaithful people, I suppose," observed the young
girl with grave innocence.

A very slight flush rose in Mrs. Bowring's thin cheeks, and the quiet
eyes grew suddenly hard, but Clare was busy with her work again and did
not see.

"Those are big words," said the older woman in a low voice.

"Well--yes--of course!" answered Clare. "So they ought to be! It is
always the main question, isn't it? Whether you can trust a person or
not, I mean."

"That is one question. The other is, whether the person deserves to be
trusted."

"Oh--it's the same thing!"

"Not exactly."

"You know what I mean, mother. Besides, I don't believe that any one who
can't trust is really to be trusted. Do you?"

"My dear Clare!" exclaimed Mrs. Bowring. "You can't put life into a
nutshell, like that!"

"No. I suppose not, though if a thing is true at all it must be always
true."

"Saving exceptions."

"Are there any exceptions to truth?" asked Clare incredulously. "Truth
isn't grammar--nor the British Constitution."

"No. But then, we don't know everything. What we call truth is what we
know. It is only what we know. All that we don't know, but which is, is
true, too--especially, all that we don't know about people with whom we
have to live."

"Oh--if people have secrets!" The young girl laughed idly. "But you and
I, for instance, mother--we have no secrets from each other, have we?
Well? Why should any two people who love each other have secrets? And if
they have none, why, then, they know all that there is to be known about
one another, and each trusts the other, and has a right to be trusted,
because everything is known--and everything is the whole truth. It seems
to me that is simple enough, isn't it?"

Mrs. Bowring laughed in her turn. It was rather a hard little laugh, but
Clare was used to the sound of it, and joined in it, feeling that she
had vanquished her mother in argument, and settled one of the most
important questions of life for ever.

"What a pretty steamer!" exclaimed Mrs. Bowring suddenly.

"It's a yacht," said Clare after a moment. "The flag is English, too. I
can see it distinctly."

She laid down her work, and her mother closed her book upon her
forefinger again, and they watched the graceful white vessel as she
glided slowly in from the Conca, which she had rounded while they had
been talking.

"It's very big, for a yacht," observed Mrs. Bowring. "They are coming
here."

"They have probably come round from Naples to spend a day," said Clare.
"We are sure to have them up here. What a nuisance!"

"Yes. Everybody comes up here who comes to Amalfi at all. I hope they
won't stay long."

"There is no fear of that," answered Clare. "I heard those people saying
the other day that this is not a place where a vessel can lie any length
of time. You know how the sea sometimes breaks on the beach."

Mrs. Bowring and her daughter desired of all things to be quiet. The
visitors who came, stayed a few days at the hotel, and went away again,
were as a rule tourists or semi-invalids in search of a climate, and
anything but noisy. But people coming in a smart English yacht would
probably be society people, and as such Mrs. Bowring wished that they
would keep away. They would behave as though the place belonged to them,
so long as they remained; they would get all the attention of the
proprietor and of the servants for the time being; and they would make
everybody feel shabby and poor.

The Bowrings were poor, indeed, but they were not shabby. It was perhaps
because they were well aware that nobody could mistake them for average
tourists that they resented the coming of a party which belonged to what
is called society. Mrs. Bowring had a strong aversion to making new
acquaintances, and even disliked being thrown into the proximity of
people who might know friends of hers, who might have heard of her, and
who might talk about her and her daughter. Clare said that her mother's
shyness in this respect was almost morbid; but she had unconsciously
caught a little of it herself, and, like her mother, she was often quite
uselessly on her guard against strangers, of the kind whom she might
possibly be called upon to know, though she was perfectly affable and at
her ease with those whom she looked upon as undoubtedly her social
inferiors.

They were not mistaken in their prediction that the party from the yacht
would come up to the Cappuccini. Half an hour after the yacht had
dropped anchor the terrace was invaded. They came up in twos and threes,
nearly a dozen of them, men and women, smart-looking people with
healthy, sun-burnt faces, voices loud from the sea as voices become on a
long voyage--or else very low indeed. By contrast with the frequenters
of Amalfi they all seemed to wear overpoweringly good clothes and
perfectly new hats and caps, and their russet shoes were resplendent.
They moved as though everything belonged to them, from the wild crests
of the hills above to the calm blue water below, and the hotel servants
did their best to foster the agreeable illusion. They all wanted chairs,
and tables, and things to drink, and fruit. One very fair little lady
with hard, restless eyes, and clad in white serge, insisted upon having
grapes, and no one could convince her that grapes were not ripe in May.

"It's quite absurd!" she objected. "Of course they're ripe! We had the
most beautiful grapes at breakfast at Leo Cairngorm's the other day, so
of course they must have them here. Brook! Do tell the man not to be
absurd!"

"Man!" said the member of the party she had last addressed. "Do not be
absurd!"

"SÃ¬, Signore," replied the black-whiskered Amalfitan servant with
alacrity.

"You see!" cried the little lady triumphantly. "I told you so! You must
insist with these people. You can always get what you want. Brook,
where's my fan?"

She settled upon a straw chair--like a white butterfly. The others
walked on towards the end of the terrace, but the young man whom she
called Brook stood beside her, slowly lighting a cigarette, not five
paces from Mrs. Bowring and Clare.

"I'm sure I don't know where your fan is," he said, with a short laugh,
as he threw the end of the match over the wall.

"Well then, look for it!" she answered, rather sharply. "I'm awfully
hot, and I want it."
