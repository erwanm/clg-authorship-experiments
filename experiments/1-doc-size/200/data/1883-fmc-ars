"Excuse me, maestro," said Hedwig, as Nino 
bowed himself out; "it was a question of arranging 
certain lessons." 

"Do not mention it," said he indifferently; "my 
time is yours, signorina. Shall we go through with 
this solfeggio once more ? " 

The good maestro did not seem greatly disturbed 
by the interruption. Hedwig wondered, dreamily, 
whether he had understood. It all seemed like a 
dream. The notes were upside down in her sight, 
and her voice sought strange minor keys unconsciously, as she vainly tried to concentrate her attention upon what she was doing. 

"Signorina," said Ercole at last, "what you sing 
is very pretty, but it is not exactly what is written 
here. I fear you are tired." 

"Perhaps so," said she. "Let us not sing any 
more to-day." Ercole shut up the music and rose. 
She gave him her hand, a thing she had never done 
before; and it was unconscious now, as everything 
she did seemed to be. There is a point when dream 
ing gets the mastery, and appears infinitely more real 
than the things we touch. 

Nino, meanwhile, had descended the steps, expect 
ing every moment to meet the count. As he went 



 

down the street, a closed carriage drove by with the 
Lira liveries. The old count was in it, but Nino 
stepped into the shadow of a doorway to let the equipage pass, and was not seen. The wooden face of 
the old nobleman almost betrayed something akin to 
emotion. He was returning from the funeral, and 
it had pained him; for he had liked the wild baroness, in a fatherly, reproving way. But the sight of 
him sent a home thrust to Nino's heart. 

"Her death is on my soul for ever, he muttered 
between his set teeth. 

Poor innocent boy, it was not his fault if she had 
loved him so much. Women have done things for 
great singers which they have not done for martyrs 
or heroes. It seems so certain that the voice that 
sings so tenderly is speaking to them individually. 
Music is such a fleeting, passionate thing that a 
woman takes it all to herself; how could he sing like 
that for an} one else ? And yet there is always some 
one for whom he does really pour out his heart, and 
all the rest are the dolls of life, to be looked at, and 
admired for their dress and complexion, and to laugh 
at when the fancy takes him to laugh; but not to 
love. 

At midnight Nino was at his post, but he waited 
long and patiently for a sign. It was past two, and 
he was thinking it hopeless to wait longer, when his 
quick ear caught the sound of a window moving on 
its hinges, and a moment later something fell at his 
feet with a sharp, metallic click. The night was 
dark and cloudy, so that the waning moon gave little 
light He picked up the thing, and found a small 



 

pocket handkerchief wrapped about a minute pair 
of scissors, apparently to give it weight. He expected a letter, and groped on the damp pavement 
with his hands. Then he struck a match, shaded it 
from the breeze with his hand, and saw that the 
handkerchief was stained with ink and that the stains 
were letters, roughly printed to make them distinct. 
He hurried away to the light of a street lamp to read 
the strange missive. 



 



CHAPTER X. 

HE went to the light and spread out the handker 
chief. It was a small thing, of almost transparent 
stuff, with a plain "H. L." and a coronet in the corner. The steel pen had torn the delicate fibres here 
and there. 

" They know you have been here. I am watched. 
Keep away from the house till you hear." 

That was all the message, but it told worlds. He 
knew from it that the count was informed of his 
visit, and he tortured himself by trying to imagine 
what the angry old man would do. His heart sank 
like a stone in his breast when he thought of Hedwig 
so imprisoned, guarded, made a martyr of, for his 
folly. He groaned aloud when he understood that it 
was in the power of her father to take her away suddenly and leave no trace of their destination, and he 
cursed his haste and impetuosity in having shown 
himself inside the house. But with all this weight 
of trouble upon him, he felt the strength and indomitable determination within him which come only to 
a man who loves, when he knows he is loved again. 
He kissed the little handkerchief, and even the scissors she had used to weight it with, and he put them 
in his bosom. But he stood irresolute, leaning 
against the lamp-post, as a man will who is trying to 



 

force his thoughts to overtake events, trying to shape 
the future out of the present. Suddenly, he was 
aware of a tall figure in a fur coat standing near him 
on the sidewalk. He would have turned to go, but 
something about the stranger's appearance struck him 
so oddly that he stayed where he was and watched 
him. 

The tall man searched for something in his pockets, 
and finally produced a cigarette, which he leisurely 
lighted with a wax match. As he did so his eyes 
fell upon Nino. The stranger was tall and very thin. 
He wore a pointed beard and a heavy moustache, 
which seemed almost dazzlingly white, as were the 
few locks that appeared, neatly brushed over his temples, beneath his opera hat. His sanguine complex 
ion, however, had all the freshness of youth, and his 
eyes sparkled merrily, as though amused at the spectacle of his nose, which was immense, curved, and 
polished, like an eagle's beak. He wore perfectly 
fitting kid gloves, and the collar of his fur wrapper, 
falling a little open, showed that he was in evening 
dress. 

It was so late past two o clock that Nino had 
not expected anything more than a policeman or some 
homeless wanderer, when he raised his eyes to look 
on the stranger. He was fascinated by the strange 
presence of the aged dandy, and returned his gaze 
boldly. He was still more astonished, however, 
when the old gentleman came close to him, and 
raised his hat, displaying, as he did so, a very high 
and narrow forehead, crowned with a mass of smooth 
white hair. There was both grace and authority in 



 

the courteous gesture, and Nino thought the old gentleman moved with an ease that matched his youthful complexion rather than his hoary locks. 

"Signer Cardegna, the distinguished artist, if I 
mistake not?" said the stranger, with a peculiar 
foreign accent, the like of which Nino had never 
heard. He, also, raised his hat, extremely surprised 
that a chance passer-by should know him. He had 
not yet learned what it is to be famous. But he 
was far from pleased at being addressed in his present mood. 

"The same, signore," he replied coldly. "How 
can I serve you ? " 

" You can serve the world you so well adorn better 
than by exposing your noble voice to the midnight 
damps and chills of this infernal I would say, eter 
nal city," answered the other. "Forgive me. I 
am, not unnaturally, concerned at the prospect of 
losing even a small portion of the pleasure you know 
how to give to me and to many others." 

"I thank you for your flattery," said Nino, drawing his cloak about him, "but it appears to me that 
my throat is my own, and whatever voice there may 
be in it. Are you a physician, signore ? And pray 
why do you tell me that Rome is an infernal city ? " 

" I have had some experience of Rome, Signer Car 
degna," returned the foreigner, with a peculiar smile, 
"and I hate no place so bitterly in all this world 
save one. And as for my being a physician, I am an 
old man, a very singularly old man in fact, and I 
know something of the art of healing." 

"When I need healing, as you call it," said Nino 



 

rather scornfully, " I will inquire for you. Do you 
desire to continue this interview amid the damps 
and chills of our infernal city ? If not, I will 
wish you good-evening." 

"By no means," said the other, not in the least 
repulsed by Nino's coldness. "I will accompany
