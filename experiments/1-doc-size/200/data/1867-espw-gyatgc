Don't you want some flag- root?" 

" Thank you. I know it, and Miss Ayre was
just as white and angry, all except her chin; 
that is always red." 



They do really say they are engaged, any 
way; Jack Delancey found her sitting in his 
lap in the front parlour she says. Poor Mr, 
Goss! He can't get over it; and he goes 
about so meekly, and blushes every time he 
sees a girl. Altogether, he is the most sub 
limely uncomfortable mortal I ever looked at. 
Peanuts? Why! why not?" 

" Why, I 'm sorry," said Gypsy, the twink 
ling dying away. "I never meant anything 
but fun. I should like to tell him so. What 
do you suppose Jane said about it, though?" 

" Oh ! that you had broken the Ten Com 
mandments, perhaps." 

" No. She just said she shouldn't think it 
would pay." 

"Just like Jane. Have a cream-cake?" 

" No, thank you. If you will let me have 
your little hammer you said I might? I 'll 
go back now and fix my trunk. I shan't get 
packed till midnight at this rate, and neithef 
will you, if you don't stop eating." 

She stopped in the doorway, thinking. 



" I wonder if It did pay. I wonder if it ever 
pays." 

Mary was too much engaged in emptying 
her pockets of cooky crumbs to make answer; 
so Gypsy went away to her own room. 

The end of the long winter term had come, 
and six ecstatic weeks of vacation were at 
hand. 

Gypsy stuffed her stove with compositions, 
packed her trunks, and went home. 

And no sooner was she there, as it seemed, 
than it was time to turn about and go back 
again. 

Jane Bruce had spent her vacation in having 
a severe influenza, and was not strong enough 
to come back at the beginning of the term. 

Maude Clare 's sister was going to be married, 
and Maude was to stay over the wedding. 

Gypsy, left alone, invited Josephine Courtis 
to share her room with her till Jane or Maude 
came back. 

" Oh, my good gracious ! " cried Miss 
Delancey. "Why, she sha n t! Why, I wouldn't 



be hired to sleep alone one night, for any 
money you could give me. My sister Belle 
always has to sleep with me at home ; and if 
she is away visitiag, I make mother come ; or 
else I have one of the servants sleep on the 
couch. Why, I should die of fright before 
morning ! " 

"Fright! What can you find to be afraid 
of, I should like to know? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; robbers, and ghosts, 
and spiritual rappings, and fifty things. I have 
an aunt who saw her candlestick walk right 
out into the air off the mantelpiece, one night, 
and how do I know but that I should see mine 
walking, if I slept alone ! I always cover my 
head up in the clothes, anyway, and I always 
make Josephine sleep the front side; don't I, 
Jo?" 

"Were?" said contemptuous Gypsy, slowly. 
" If I enjoyed being an infant, I 'd be an infant, 
but it would be a good while before I would 
boast of it." 

" It is very nice to talk," said Jacqueline, 






colouring, " but I should like to know what 
you want of my room-mate if you re not afraid 
just as much as I am." 

" I want her because she is funny, and good 
company to have round, and I never was afraid 
to sleep alone, since I dispensed with nurses ! 
If you won't believe me, I 'll go and spend a 
night up garret, for I should be ashamed to 
have anybody think I was afraid." 

Now, the garret at the Golden Crescent was 
a dismal place; dark with cobwebs, frowning 
with shadows, ghostly with old quilts and cast- 
off garments ; moreover, the wind shrieked, 
with an extremely unpleasant sound, down the 
huge old-fashioned chimneys. Therefore, in 
credulous Jacqueline screamed at Gypsy 's pro 
posal, and said that it made her cold so much 
as to think of it. 

Gypsy made herself up a bed under the 
eaves, and at nine o'clock that night, went up, 
a stout-faced, white-robed little figure, dragging 
a pillow, and slept there, true to her word, till 
morning. 


Jacqueline went up herself at six o'clock 
to wake her, and be sure that there was no 
hoax about it. 

The girls rushed to Gypsy 's room while she 
was dressing, to hear about it. 

" How did you ever dare to? " 

" Weren't you awfully scared? " 

" Didn't you lie awake all night?" 

"And didn't you once think you saw a 
ghost?" 

" Or a candlestick walking? " 

" Oh, I wouldn't have done it for anything ! ** 

Nor I ! " 

" Think of it ! " 

" Such a quantity of rats and spiders ! Why, 
I 'm as afraid of a mouse as I can be." 

" Well," said Jacqueline, finishing the chorus, 
" it is very well for you ; you don't mind thun 
der-showers, and you didn't scream when we 
upset on that sleigh-ride, and you re not afraid 
of robbers, but I am nervous. I am so timid 
mother says I am the most timid child she 

ever had." 


It required all Gypsy 's politeness to keep 
out of her face and tones the little flash of 
scorn with which she heard this remark. 

"Jacqueline Delancey, you really talk as 
if you thought it were a pretty thing to be 
timid ! " 

And Jacqueline looked very much as if she 
thought so, which was more. 

" I really don't see," persisted Gypsy, "I 
really don't see why a girl should be a goose, 
because she is a girl. Now, if my brother Tom 
were here, and had slept up garret, would you 
ask him if he was afraid, or would you think it 
an insult? " 

" Of course I shouldn't ask him ! " 

" Well, then, if it would be unmanly in him 
to be afraid of nothing, I say it is unwomanly 
in me to be afraid of nothing, and what 's more 
I won't be ! Now, where did I leave that hair 
brush?" 

Mademoiselle, when she heard of the matter, 
proposed to sleep with Jacqueline, in order that
