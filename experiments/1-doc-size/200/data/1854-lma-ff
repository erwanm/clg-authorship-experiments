hoping one day to see the friends they had lost; while the joy of
their own hearts made their life full of happiness.
One day came little Bud to them, saying,--
"Listen, dear friends.  I have a hard task to offer you.  It is a
great sacrifice for you light loving Fairies to dwell through the long
winter in the dark, cold earth, watching over the flower roots, to keep
them free from the little grubs and worms that seek to harm them.
But in the sunny Spring when they bloom again, their love and
gratitude will give you happy homes among their bright leaves.
"It is a wearisome task, and I can give you no reward for all your
tender care, but the blessings of the gentle flowers you will have
saved from death.  Gladly would I aid you; but my winged friends are
preparing for their journey to warmer lands, and I must help them
teach their little ones to fly, and see them safely on their way.
Then, through the winter, must I seek the dwellings of the poor
and suffering, comfort the sick and lonely, and give hope and courage
to those who in their poverty are led astray.  These things must I do;
but when the flowers bloom again I will be with you, to welcome back
our friends from over the sea."
Then, with tears, the Fairies answered, "Ah, good little Bud, you have
taken the hardest task yourself, and who will repay you for all your
deeds of tenderness and mercy in the great world? Should evil befall
you, our hearts would break.  We will labor trustingly in the earth,
and thoughts of you shall cheer us on; for without you we had been
worthless beings, and never known the joy that kindly actions bring.
Yes, dear Bud, we will gladly toil among the roots, that the fair
flowers may wear their gayest robes to welcome you."
Then deep in the earth the Fairies dwelt, and no frost or snow
could harm the blossoms they tended.  Every little seed was laid
in the soft earth, watered, and watched.  Tender roots were folded
in withered leaves, that no chilling drops might reach them; and
safely dreamed the flowers, till summer winds should call them forth;
while lighter grew each Fairy heart, as every gentle deed was
tenderly performed.
At length the snow was gone, and they heard little voices calling them
to come up; but patiently they worked, till seed and root were green
and strong.  Then, with eager feet, they hastened to the earth above,
where, over hill and valley, bright flowers and budding trees smiled
in the warm sunlight, blossoms bent lovingly before them, and rang
their colored bells, till the fragrant air was full of music; while
the stately trees waved their great arms above them, and scattered
soft leaves at their feet.
Then came the merry birds, making the wood alive with their gay
voices, calling to one another, as they flew among the vines,
building their little homes.  Long waited the Elves, and at last
she came with Father Brown-Breast.  Happy days passed; and
summer flowers were in their fullest beauty, when Bud bade the Fairies
come with her.
Mounted on bright-winged butterflies, they flew over forest and
meadow, till with joyful eyes they saw the flower-crowned walls
of Fairy-Land.
Before the gates they stood, and soon troops of loving Elves
came forth to meet them.  And on through the sunny gardens they went,
into the Lily Hall, where, among the golden stamens of a graceful
flower, sat the Queen; while on the broad, green leaves around it
stood the brighteyed little maids of honor.
Then, amid the deep silence, little Bud, leading the Fairies to the
throne, said,--
"Dear Queen, I here bring back your subjects, wiser for their sorrow,
better for their hard trial; and now might any Queen be proud of them,
and bow to learn from them that giving joy and peace to others
brings it fourfold to us, bearing a double happiness in the blessings
to those we help.  Through the dreary months, when they might have
dwelt among fair Southern flowers, beneath a smiling sky, they toiled
in the dark and silent earth, filling the hearts of the gentle Flower
Spirits with grateful love, seeking no reward but the knowledge of
their own good deeds, and the joy they always bring.  This they have
done unmurmuringly and alone; and now, far and wide, flower blessings
fall upon them, and the summer winds bear the glad tidings unto those
who droop in sorrow, and new joy and strength it brings, as they look
longingly for the friends whose gentle care hath brought such
happiness to their fair kindred.
"Are they not worthy of your love, dear Queen? Have they not won
their lovely home? Say they are pardoned, and you have gained
the love of hearts pure as the snow-white robes now folded over them."
As Bud ceased, she touched the wondering Fairies with her wand,
and the dark faded garments fell away; and beneath, the robes
of lily-leaves glittered pure and spotless in the sun-light.
Then, while happy tears fell, Queen Dew-Drop placed the bright crowns
on the bowed heads of the kneeling Fairies, and laid before them
the wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful.
They turned to thank little Bud for all her patient love,
but she was gone; and high above, in the clear air, they saw
the little form journeying back to the quiet forest.
She needed no reward but the joy she had given.  The Fairy hearts
were pure again, and her work was done; yet all Fairy-Land had learned
a lesson from gentle little Bud.
"Now, little Sunbeam, what have you to tell us?" said the Queen,
looking down on a bright-eyed Elf, who sat half hidden in the deep
moss at her feet.
"I too, like Star-Twinkle, have nothing but a song to offer,"
replied the Fairy; and then, while the nightingale's sweet voice
mingled with her own, she sang,--
CLOVER-BLOSSOM.
   IN a quiet, pleasant meadow,
     Beneath a summer sky,
   Where green old trees their branches waved,
     And winds went singing by;
   Where a little brook went rippling
     So musically low,
   And passing clouds cast shadows
     On the waving grass below;
   Where low, sweet notes of brooding birds
     Stole out on the fragrant air,
   And golden sunlight shone undimmed
     On all most fresh and fair;--
   There bloomed a lovely sisterhood
     Of happy little flowers,
   Together in this pleasant home,
     Through quiet summer hours.
   No rude hand came to gather them,
     No chilling winds to blight;
   Warm sunbeams smiled on them by day,
     And soft dews fell at night.
   So here, along the brook-side,
     Beneath the green old trees,
   The flowers dwelt among their friends,
     The sunbeams and the breeze.
   One morning, as the flowers awoke,
     Fragrant, and fresh, and fair,
   A little worm came creeping by,
     And begged a shelter there.
   "Ah! pity and love me," sighed the worm,
     "I am lonely, poor, and weak;
   A little spot for a resting-place,
     Dear flowers, is all I seek.
   I am not fair, and have dwelt unloved
     By butterfly, bird, and bee.
   They little knew that in this dark form
     Lay the beauty they yet may see.
   Then let me lie in the deep green moss,
     And weave my little tomb,
   And sleep my long, unbroken sleep
     Till Spring's first flowers come.
   Then will I come in a fairer dress,
     And your gentle care repay
   By the grateful love of the humble worm;
     Kind flowers, O let me stay!"
   But the wild rose showed her little thorns,
     While her soft face glowed with pride;
   The violet hid beneath the drooping ferns,
     And the daisy turned aside.
   Little Houstonia scornfully laughed,
     As she danced on her slender stem;
   While the cowslip bent to the rippling waves,
     And whispered the tale to them.
   A blue-eyed grass looked down on the worm,
     As it silently turned away,
   And cried, "Thou wilt harm our delicate leaves,
     And therefore thou canst not stay."
   Then a sweet, soft voice, called out from far,
     "Come hither, poor worm, to me;
   The sun lies warm in this quiet spot,
     And I'll share my home with thee."
   The wondering flowers looked up to see
     Who had offered the worm a home:
   'T was a clover-blossom, whose fluttering leaves
     Seemed beckoning him to come;
   It dwelt in a sunny little nook,
     Where cool winds rustled by,
   And murmuring bees and butterflies came,
     On the flower's breast to lie.
   Down through the leaves the sunlight stole,
     And seemed to linger there,
   As if it loved to brighten the home
     Of one so sweet and fair.
   Its rosy face smiled kindly down,
     As the friendless worm drew near;
   And its low voice, softly whispering, said
     "Poor thing, thou art welcome here;
   Close at my side, in the soft green moss,
     Thou wilt find a quiet bed,
   Where thou canst softly sleep till Spring,
     With my leaves above thee spread.
   I pity and love thee, friendless worm,
     Though thou art not graceful or fair;
   For many a dark, unlovely form,
     Hath a kind heart dwelling there;
   No more o'er the green and pleasant earth,
     Lonely and poor, shalt thou roam,
   For a loving friend hast thou found in me,
     And rest in my little home."
   Then, deep in its quiet mossy bed,
     Sheltered from sun and shower,
   The grateful worm spun its winter tomb,
     In the shadow of the flower.
   And Clover guarded well its rest,
     Till Autumn's leaves were sere,
   Till all her sister flowers were gone,
     And her winter sleep drew near.
   Then her withered leaves were softly spread
     O'er the sleeping worm below,
   Ere the faithful little flower lay
     Beneath the winter snow.
   Spring came again, and the flowers rose
     From their quiet winter graves,
   And gayly danced on their slender stems,
     And sang with the rippling waves.
   Softly the warm winds kissed their cheeks;
     Brightly the sunbeams fell,
