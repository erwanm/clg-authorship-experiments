You know that kind of mistress — 'who is 
only vexed when she is neglected. You 
may tell this to your daughter — 'you will 
restore her to the arms of her husband, 
from whom she has no longer anything to 
fear, and I will guarantee that you will 
be a happy grandfather two years from 
now.'' 

Monsieur Loches at last showed that he 
was weakened in his resolution. 

"Doctor,'' he said, ''I do not know that 
I can ever go so far as forgiveness, but I 
promise you that I will do no irreparable 
act, and that I will not oppose a reconcilia- 



 

tion if after the lapse of some time — I 
cannot venture to say how long — 'my poor 
child should make up her mind to a recon- 
ciliation.' 

"Very good.' said the other. "But 
let me add this: If you have another 
daughter, take care to avoid the fault 
which you committed when you married 
off the first." 

"But.' said the old man, "I did not 
know." 

"Ah, surely!" cried the other. "You 
did not know! You are a father, and you 
did not know! You are a deputy, you have 
assumed the responsibility and the honor 
of making our laws — and you did not know! 
You are ignorant about syphilis, just as 
you probably are ignorant about alcohohsm 
and tuberculosis." 

"No," exclaimed the other, quickly. 

"Very well," said the doctor, "I will 
leave you out, if you wish. I am talking 
of the others, the five hundred, and I 
don't know how many more, who are there 
in the Chamber of Deputies, and who call 
themselves representatives of the people. 



 

They are not able to find a single hour to 
discuss these three cruel gods, to which 
egotism and indifference make every day 
such frightful human sacrifices. They have 
not sufficient leisure to combat this fero- 
cious trinity, which destroys every day 
thousands of lives. Alcoholism! It would 
be necessary to forbid the manufacture of 
poisons, and to restrict the number of 
hcenses; but as one has fear of the great 
distillers, who are rich and powerful, and 
of the little dealers, who are the masters 
of universal suffrage, one puts one's con- 
science to sleep by lamenting the immorality 
of the working-class, and publishing httle 
pamphlets and sermons. Imbeciles! . . . 
Tuberculosis! Everybody Imows the true 
remedy, which would be the paying of 
sufficient wages, and the tearing down of the 
filthy tenements into which the laborers 
are packed — those who are the most useful 
and the most unfortunate among our popu- 
lation ! But needless to say, no one wants 
that remedy, so we go round begging the 
workingmen not to spit on the sidewalks. 
Wonderful! But syphiHs — why do you 



 

not occupy yourself with that? Why, 
since you have ministers whose duty it 
is to attend to all sorts of things, do you 
not have a minister to attend to the public 
health? '' 

''My dear Doctor.' responded Monsieur 
Loches, ''you fall into the French habit of 
considering the government as the cause 
of all evils. Show us the way, you learned 
gentlemen! Since that is a matter about 
which you are informed, and we are igno- 
rant, begin by telling us what measures you 
believe to be necessary." 

'' Ah, ah ! " exclaimed the other. '' That's 
fine, indeed! It was about eighteen years 
ago that a project of that nature, worked 
out by the Academy of Medicine, and 
approved by it unanimously, was sent to 
the proper minister. We have not yet heard 
his reply." 

''You really believe," inquired Monsieur 
Loches, in some bewilderment, ''you beheve 
that there are some measures " 

"Sir," broke in the doctor, "before we 
get through, you are going to suggest some 
measures yourself. Let me tell you what 

 



 



happened today. When I received your 
card I did not know that you were the 
father-in-law of George Dupont. I saw 
that you were a deputy, and I thought that 
you wanted to get some information about 
these matters. There was a woman patient 
waiting to see me, and I kept her in my 
waiting-room — saying to myseh, ''This 
is just the sort of person that our deputies 
ought to talk to.'' 

The doctor paused for a moment, then 
continued, with a smile: ''Be reassured, 
I will take care of your nerves. This 
patient has no trouble that is apparent 
to the eye. She is simply an illustration 
of the argument I have been advancing — 
that our worst enemy is ignorance. Igno- 
rance — 'you understand me? Since I have 
got you here, sir, I am going to hold 
you until I have managed to cure a 
httle of your ignorance! For I tell you, 
sir, it is a thing which drives me to distrac- 
tion — 'we must do something about these 
conditions! Take this case, for example. 
Here is a woman who is very seriously 
infected. I told her— well, wait; you 
shall see for yourself." 



 

The doctor went to the door and sum- 
moned into the room a woman whom Mon- 
sieur Loches had noticed waiting there. She 
was verging on old age, small, frail, and 
ill-nourished in appearance, poorly dressed, 
and yet with a suggestion of refinement 
about her. She stood near the door, twist- 
ing her hands together nervously, and 
shrinking from the gaze of the strange 
gentleman. The doctor began in an angry 
voice. ''Did I not tell you to come and 
see me once every eight days? Is that not 
true?" 

The woman answered, in a faint voice, 
''Yes, sir.'' 

''Well," he exclaimed, ''and how long 
has it been since you were here? " 

"Three months, sir." 

"Three months! And you believe that 
I can take care of you under such con- 
ditions! I give you up! Do you under- 
stand? You discourage me, you discourage 
me." There was a pause. Then, seeing 
the woman's suffering, he began, in a 
gentler tone, "Come now, what is the rea- 
son that you have not' come? Didn't you 



 



know that you have a serious disease — 
most serious?''
