Did Henderson believe? After all, what did it 
matter ? Perhaps, after all, the woman had a right 
to her game, a's he had to his. 

" Oh, well," he said, " don't take on about it. 
I'll fix it. I'll make a memorandum this minute. 
Only don't you bother me in the future with too 
many private kites." 

Carmen dried her eyes. She did not look tri- 
umphant ; she just looked sweet and grateful, like a 
person who had been helped. She went over and 
kissed her lord on the forehead, and sat on the arm 
of his chair, not too long, and then patted him on 
the shoulder, and said he was a good fellow, and 
she was a little bother, and so went away like a 
dutiful little wife. 

And Henderson sat looking into the fire and 
musing, with the feeling that he had been at the 
theatre, and that the comedy had been beautifully 
played. 

His part of the play was carried out next day 
in good faith. One of the secrets of Henderson's 



success was that he always did what he said he 
would do. This attracted men to him personally, and 
besides he found, as Bismarck did, that it was more 
serviceable to him than lying, for the crafty world 
usually banks upon insincerity and indirectness. 
But while he kept his word he also kept his schemes 
to himself, and executed them with a single re- 
gard to his own interest and a Napoleonic selfish- 
ness. He did not lie to enemy or friend, but he 
did not spare either when either was in his way. 
He knew how to appeal to the self - interest of his 
fellows, and in time those who had most to do with 
him trusted him least when he seemed most gener- 
ous in his offers. 

When, the next day, his secretary reported to 
him briefly that Delancy was greatly elated with 
the turn things had taken for him, and was going 
in again, Henderson smiled sardonically, and said, 
" It was the worst thing I could have done for 
him." 

Jack, who did not understand the irony of his 
temporary rescue, and had little experience of com- 
mercial integrity, so called, was intent on fulfilling 
his part of the understanding with Carmen. This 
could best be effected by a return dinner to the 
Hendersons. The subject was broached at break- 
fast in an off-hand manner to Edith. 

It was not an agreeable subject to Edith, that 
was evident ; but it was not easy for her to raise 





objections to the dinner. She had gone to the 
Hendersons to please Jack, in her policy of yield- 
ing in order to influence him ; but having accepted 
the hospitality, she could not object to returning it. 
The trouble was in making the list. 

" I do not know," said Edith, " who are the 
Hendersons' friends." 

"Oh, that doesn't matter. Ask our friends. 
If we are going to do a thing to please them, no 
use in doing it half - way, so as to offend them, by 
drawing social lines against them." 

" Well, suggest." 

" There's Mavick ; he'll be over from Washing- 
ton next week." 

" That's good ; and, oh, I'll ask Father Damon." 

" Yes ; he'll give a kind of flavor to it. I shouldn't 
wonder if he would like to meet such a man as 
Henderson." 

"And then the Yan Dams and Miss Tavish; they 
were at Henderson's, and would help to make it 
easy." 

" Yes ; well, let's see. The Schuyler Blunts ?" 

" Oh, they wouldn't do at all. They wouldn't 
come. She wouldn't think of going to the Hen- 
dersons." 

" But she would come to us. I don't think she 
would mind once in a way." 

" But why do you want them ?" 

" I don't want them particularly ; but it would 







no doubt please the Hendersons more than any 
other thing we could do and, well, I don't want 
to offend Henderson just now. It's a little thing, 
anyway. What's the use of all this social non- 
sense? We are not responsible for either the Hen- 
dersons or the Blunts being in the world. No harm 
done if they don't come. You invite them, and 
I'll take the responsibility." 

So it was settled, against Edith's instinct of pro- 
priety, and the dinner was made up by the addi- 
tion of the elder Miss Chesney. And Jack did 
persuade Mrs. Blunt to accept. In fact, she had a 
little curiosity to see the man whose name was in 
the newspapers more prominently than that of the 
President. 

It was a bright thought to secure Mr. Mavick. 
Mr. Thomas Mavick was socially one of the most 
desirable young men of the day. Matrimonially 
he was not a prize, for he was without fortune and 
without powerful connections. He had a position 
in the State Department. Originally he came from 
somewhere in the West, it was said, but he had 
early obtained one or two minor diplomatic places; 
he had lived a good deal abroad ; he had travelled 
a little a good deal, it would seem, from his oc- 
casional Oriental allusions. He threw over his 
past a slight mystery, not too much ; and he always 
took himself seriously. His salary was sufficient 
to set up a bachelor very comfortably who always 





dined out ; he dressed in the severity of the fash- 
ion ; he belonged only to the best clubs, where he 
unbent more than anywhere else ; he was credited 
with knowing a good deal more than he would tell. 
It was believed, in fact, that he had a great deal 
of influence. The President had been known to 
send for him on delicate personal business with re- 
gard to appointments, and there were certain tick- 
lish diplomatic transactions that he was known to 
have managed most cleverly. His "friends could 
see his hand in state papers. This he disclaimed, 
but he never denied that he knew the inside of 
whatever was going on in Washington. Even those 
who thought him a snob said he was clever. He 
had perfectly the diplomatic manner, and the re- 
serve of one charged with grave secrets. What- 
ever he disclosed was always in confidence, so that 
he had the reputation of being as discreet as he 
was knowing. With women he was of course a 
favorite, for he knew how to be confidential with- 
out disclosing anything, and the hints he dropped 
about persons in power simply showed that he was 
secretly manoeuvring important affairs, and could 
make the most interesting revelations if he chose. 
His smile and the shake of his head at the club 
when talk was personal conveyed a world of mean- 
ing. Tom Mavick was, in short, a most accom- 
plished fellow. It was evident that he carried on 
the State Department, and the wonder to many 



was that he was not in a position to do it openly. 
His social prestige was as mysterious as his diplo- 
matic, but it was now unquestioned, and he might be 
considered as one of the first of a class who are to 
reconcile social and political life in this country. 



CHAPTER Vlli 

LOOKING back upon this dinner of the Delancys, 
the student of human affairs can see how Provi- 
dence uses small means for the accomplishment of 
its purposes. Of all our social contrivances, the 
formal dinner is probably the cause of more anx- 
iety in the arrangement, of more weariness in the 
performance, and usually of less satisfaction in the 
retrospect than any other social function. How-
