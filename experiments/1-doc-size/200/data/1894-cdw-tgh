passage opposite. A woman opened the door 
wide enough to show her head and to make it 
evident that she was not sufficiently dressed to 
come out, and said that Father Damon had gone. 
He was very much better, and his friend had taken 
him up-town. Dr. Leigh thanked her, and said 
she was very glad. 

She was so glad that, as she walked away, scarce- 
ly heeding her steps or conscious of the chaffing, 
chattering crowd, all interest in her work and in 
that quarter of the city seemed dead. 



CHAPTER XIII 

IT is well that there is pleasure somewhere in 
the world. It is possible for those who have a 
fresh-air fund of their own to steam away in a 
yacht, out of the midsummer ennui and the weary 
gayety of the land. It is a costly pleasure, and 
probably all the more enjoyed on that account, 
for if everybody had a yacht there would be no 
more feeling of distinction in sailing one than in 
going to any of the second-rate resorts on the 
coast. There is, to be sure, some ennui in yacht- 
ing on a rainy coast, and it might be dull but for 
the sensation created by arrivals at watering-places 
and the telegraphic reports of these sensations. 

If there was any dulness on the Delancy yacht 
means were taken to dispel it. While still in the 
Sound a society was formed for the suppression of 
total abstinence, and so successful was this that 
Point Judith was passed, in a rain and a high and 
chopping sea, with a kind of hilarious enjoyment 
of the commotion, which is one of the things de- 
sired at sea. When the party came round to New- 
port it declared that it had had a lovely voyage, 
and inquiry brought out the great general princi- 



pie, applicable to most coast navigation for pleas- 
ure, that the enjoyable way to pass Point Judith 
is not to know you are passing Point Judith. 

Except when you land, and even after you have 
got your sea-legs on, there is a certain monotony in 
yachting, unless the weather is very bad, and unless 
there are women aboard. A party of lively women 
make even the sea fresh and entertaining. Other- 
wise, the game of poker is much what it is on land, 
and the constant consulting of charts and reckon- 
ing of speed evince the general desire to get some- 
where that is, to arrive at a harbor. In the recol- 
lections of this voyage, even in Jack's recollections 
of it after he had paid the bills, it seemed that it 
had been simply glorious, free from care, generally 
a physical-setting-up performance, and a lark of 
enormous magnitude. And everybody envied the 
fortunate sailors. 

Mavick actually did enjoy it, for he had that 
brooding sort of nature, that self-satisfied atti- 
tude, that is able to appropriate to its own uses 
whatever comes. And being an unemotional and 
very tolerable sailor, he was able to be as cyn- 
ical at sea as on land, and as much of an oracle, 
in his wholly unobtrusive way. The perfect per- 
sonal poise of Mavick, which gave him an air of 
patronizing the ocean, and his lightly held scep- 
tical view of life, made his company as full of fla- 
vor on ship as it was on shore. He didn't know 





anything more about the weather than the Weath- 
er Bureau knows, yet the helmsman of the yacht 
used to consult him about the appearances of the 
sky and a change of wind with a confidence in his 
opinion that he gave to no one else on board. 
And Mavick never forfeited this respect by being 
too positive. It was so with everything ; he evi- 
dently knew a great deal more than he cared to 
tell. It is pleasing to notice how much credit 
such men as Mavick obtain in the world by cir- 
cumspect reticence and a knowing manner. Jack, 
blundering along in his free-hearted, emotional 
way, and never concealing his opinion, was really 
right twice where Mavick was right once, but he 
never had the least credit for wisdom. 

It was late in August that the Delancy yacht 
steamed into the splendid Bar Harbor, making its 
way slowly through one of the rare fogs which 
are sometimes seen by people who do not own real 
estate there. Even before they could see an island 
those on board felt the combination of mountain 
and sea air that makes this favored place at once a 
tonic and a sedative to the fashionable world. 

The party were expected at Bar Harbor. It had 
been announced that the yacht was on its way, 
and some of the projected gayeties were awaiting 
its coming, for the society re-enforcement of the 
half-dozen men on board was not to be despised. 
The news went speedily round that Captain De> 





lancy's flag was flying at the anchorage off the 
landing. 

Among the first to welcome them as they landed 
and strolled up to the hotel was Major Fairfax. 

" Oh yes," he said ; " we are all here that is, all 
who know where they ought to be at the right 
moment." 

To the new-comers the scene was animated. The 
exotic shops sparkled with cheap specialties ; lan- 
daus, pony-phaetons, and elaborate buckboards 
dashed through the streets ; aquatic and lawn-ten- 
nis costumes abounded. If there was not much 
rowing and lawn-tennis, there was a great 'deal of 
becoming morning dressing for these sports, and in 
all the rather aimless idleness there was an air of 
determined enjoyment. Even here it was evident 
that there was a surplus of women. These lovers 
of nature, in the summer season, who had retired 
to this wild place to be free from the importunities 
of society, betrayed, Mavick thought, the common 
instinct of curiosity over the new arrival, and he 
was glad to take it as an evidence that they loved 
not nature less but man more. Jack tripped up 
this ungallant speech by remarking that if Mavick 
was in this mood he did not know why he came 
ashore. And Yan Dam said that sooner or later 
all men went ashore. This thin sort of talk was 
perhaps pardonable after the weariness of a sea 
voyage, but the Major promptly said it wouldn't 





do. And the Major seemed to be in charge of the 
place. 

" No epigrams are permitted. We are here to 
enjoy ourselves. I'm ordered to bring the whole 
crew of you to tea at the Tavish cottage." 

" Anybody else there ?" asked Jack, carelessly. 

" Well, it's the most curious coincidence, but 
Mrs. Henderson arrived last night ; Henderson has 
gone to Missouri." 

" Yes, he wrote me to look out for his wife on 
this coast," said Mavick. 

" You kept mighty still about it," said Jack. 

" So did you," retorted Mavick. 

" It is very curious," the Major explained, " how 
fashionable intelligence runs along this coast, ap- 
parently independent of the telegraph ; everybody 
knows where everybody else is." 

The Tavish cottage was a summer palace of the 
present fashion, but there was one good thing about 
it : it had no tower, nor any make-believe balconies 
hung on the outside like bird - cages. The rooms 
were spacious, and had big fireplaces, and ample 
piazzas all round, so that the sun could be courted 
or the wind be avoided at all hours of the day. It 
was, in short, not a house for retirement and pri- 
vacy, but for entertainment. It was furnished lux- 
uriously but gayly, and with its rugs and portieres 
and divans it reminded Mavick of an Oriental mar- 
quee. Miss Tavish called it her tepee, an evolution 





of the aboriginal dwelling. She liked to entertain, 
and she never appeared to better advantage than
