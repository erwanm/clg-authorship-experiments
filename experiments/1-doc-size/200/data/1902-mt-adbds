and he wasn't left-handed. With the 
exception of these errors, the distin- 
guished guest's statement of the case 
is substantially correct.'' 

A comfortable laugh rippled over 
the house; friend nodded to friend, as 
much as to say, ''That's the word, 
with the bark on it. Good lad, good 
boy. He ain't lowering his flag 
any!" 

The guest's serenity was not disturbed. 
Stillman resumed: 

" I also have some witnesses ; and I 
will presently tell you where you can 
find some more.'' He held up a piece 
of coarse wire; the crowd craned their 
necks to see. " It has a smooth coating 
of melted tallow on it. And here 
is a candle which is burned half-way 
down. The remaining half of it has 
marks cut upon it an inch apart. 

Soon I will tell you where I found 
these things. I will now put aside 
reasonings, guesses, the impressive 
hitching of odds and ends of clews 
together, and the other showy theatricals 
of the detective trade, and tell you 
in a plain, straightforward way just 
 how this dismal thing happened' 

' He paused a moment, for effect — to 

happened allow silence and suspense 
to intensify and concentrate the house's interest; 
then he went on : 

"The assassin studied out his plan 
with a good deal of pains. It was a 
good plan, very ingenious, and showed 
an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. 
It was a plan which was well calcu- 
lated to ward off all suspicion from its 
inventor. In the first place, he marked 
a candle into spaces an inch apart, 
and lit it and timed it. He found it 
took three hours to burn four inches 
of it. I tried it myself for half an hour, 
awhile ago, upstairs here, while the 
inquiry into Flint Buckner's character 
and ways was being conducted in 
this room, and I arrived in that way 
at the rate of a candle's consumption 
when sheltered from the wind. Hav- 
ing proved his trial-candle's rate, he 
blew it out — I have already shown it 
to you — and put his inch-marks on a 
fresh one. 

"He put the fresh one into a tin 
candlestick. Then at the five-hour 
mark he bored a hole through the 
candle with a red-hot wire. I have 
already shown you the wire, with a 
smooth coat of tallow on it — tal- 
low that had been melted and had 
cooled. 

"With labor — very hard labor, I 
should say — he struggled up through 
the stiff chaparral that clothes the 
steep hill-side back of Flint Buckner's 
place, tugging an empty flour-barrel 
with him. He placed it in that ab- 
solutely secure hiding-place, and in 
the bottom of it he set the candlestick. 
Then he measured off about thirty- 
five feet of fuse — the barrel's distance 
from the back of the cabin. He bored 

Lavfria barrel — here 
the mine he large gimlet he did it with. He 

went on and finished his work; and 
when it was done, one end of the fuse 
was in Buckner's cabin, and the other 
end, with a notch chipped in it to ex- 
pose the powder, was in the hole in 
the candle — timed to blow the place 
up at one o'clock this morning, pro- 
vided the candle was lit about eight 
o'clock yesterday evening — which I 

am betting it was — and provided there 
was an explosive in the cabin and 
connected with that end of the fuse — ddaits 

which I am also betting there was, 
though I can't prove it. Boys, the 
barrel is there in the chaparral, the 
candle's remains are in it in the tin 
stick ; the burnt-out fuse is in the gim- 
let-hole, the other end is down the hill 
where the late cabin stood. I saw 
them all an hour or two ago, when 
the Professor here was measuring off 
unimplicated vacancies and collecting 
relic5.ihat hadn't anything to do with 
the case,!' v 

He paused. The house drew a 
long, deep breath, shook its strained 
cords and muscles free and burst 
into cheers. 


"Dang him'' said Ham Sandwich, 
"that's why he was snooping around 
in the chaparral, instead of picking 
up points out of the P'fessor's game. 
Looky here — he ain't no fool, boys' 
"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" 
But Stillman was resuming: 
" While we were out yonder an hour 
or two ago, the owner of the gimlet 
and the trial-candle took them from a 
place where he had concealed them — 
it was not a good place — and carried 
them to what he probably thought 
was a better one, two hundred yards 
up in the pine woods, and hid them 
there, covering them over with pine 
needles. It was there that I found 
them. The gimlet exactly fits the 
hole in the barrel. And now — " 

The Extraordinary Man interrupted 
him. He said, sarcasticall} : 

"We have had a very pretty fairy- f 
tale, gentlemen — very pretty indeed.  

Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot
