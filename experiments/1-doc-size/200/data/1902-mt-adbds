bed three hours ago, tuckered out 
tramping the trails the way he's al- 
ways doing, and went up stairs. Ham 
Sandwich, run up and roust him out; 
he's in No. 14." 
The youth was soon downstairs 
and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan 
for particulars. 
''Bless you, dear, there ain't any; 
I wish there was. I put her to sleep 
at seven in the evening, and when I 
went in there an hour ago to go to bed
myself, she was gone. I rushed for 
your cabin, dear, and you wasn't 
there, and Tve hunted for you ever 
since, at every cabin down the gulch, 
and now Tve come up again, and 
Fm that distracted and scared and 
heart-broke; but, thanks to God, Tve 
found you at last, dear heart, and 
you'll find my child. Come on I come 
quick !'' 
"Move right along; Fm with you, 
madam. Go to your cabin first." 
The whole company streamed out 
to join the hunt. All the southern 
half of the village was up, a hundred 
men strong, and waiting outside, a 
vague dark mass sprinkled with twin- 
kling lanterns. The mass fell into 
columns by threes and fours to ac- 
commodate itself to the narrow road, 
and strode briskly along southward 
in the wake of the leaders. In a 
few minutes the Hogan cabin was 
reached. 
"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Ho- 
gan; "there's where she was; it's 
where I laid her at seven o'clock; but 
where she is now, God only knows." 
" Hand me a lantern," said Archy. 
He set it on the hard earth floor 
and knelt by it, pretending to exam- 
ine the ground closely. "Here's her 
track," he said, touching the ground 
here and there and yonder with his 
finger. " Do you see?" 
Several of the company dropped 
upon their knees and did their best 
to see. One or two thought they 
discerned something hke a track; 
the others shook their heads and con- 
fessed that the smooth hard surface 
had no marks upon it which their 
eyes were sharp enough to discover. 
One said, " Maybe a child's foot could 
make a mark on it, but I don't see 
how." 
Young Stillman stepped outside, 
held the light to the ground, turned 
leftward, and moved along three steps. 
On the trail closely examining; then said,
"I've got the direction — come along; take 
the lantern, somebody." 
He strode off swiftly southward. 
The files following, swaying and bending 
in and out with the deep curves 
of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the 
mouth of the gorge was reached; 
before them stretched the sage-brush 
Following an plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman 
called a halt, saying, "We mustn't 
start wrong, now; we must take the 
direction again.'' He took a lantern 
and examined the ground for a matter 
of twenty yards; then said, "Come 
on; it's all right," and gave up the 
lantern. In and out among the sage- 
bushes he marched, a quarter of a 
mile, bearing gradually to the right; 
then took a new direction and made 
another great semicircle; then changed 
again and moved due west nearly 
half a mile — and stopped. 
"She gave it up, here, poor little 
chap. Hold the lantern. You can 
see where she sat' 
But this was in a slick alkali flat 
which was surfaced like steel, and no 
person in the party was quite hardy 
enough to claim an eyesight that 
could detect the track of a cushion 
on a veneer like that. The bereaved 
mother fell upon her knees and kissed 
the spot, lamenting. 
"But where is she, then?'' some 
one said. "She didn't stay here. 
We can see that much, anyway." 
Stillman moved about in a circle 
around the place, with the lantern, 
pretending to hunt for tracks. " Well ! ' ' 
he said presently, in an annoyed 
tone, "I don't understand it." He 
examined again. ''No use. She was 
here — that's certain; she never walked 
away from here — and that's certain. 
It's a puzzle; I can't make it out." 
The mother lost heart then. 
"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! 
some flying beast has got her. I'll 
never see her again!" 
"Ah, don't give up," said Archy. 
"We'll find her— don't give up." 
"God bless you for the words, 
Archy Stillman!" and she seized his 
hand and kissed it fervently. 
Peterson, the new-comer, whispered 
satirically in Ferguson's ear: 
"Wonderful performance to find 
this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth 
while to come so far, though; any 
other supposititious place would have 
answered just as well — hey?" 
Ferguson was not pleased with 
the innuendo. He said, with some 
warmth : ' 
"Do you mean to insinuate that 
the child hasn't been here? I tell 
you the child has been here! Now 
if you want to get yourself into as 
tidy a little fuss as — '' 
''All right!" sang out Stillman 
"Come, everybody, and look at this! 
It was right under our noses all the 
time, and we didn't see it' 
There was a general plunge for 
the ground at the place where the 
child was alleged to have rested, and 
many eyes tried hard and hopefully to 
see the thing that Archy's finger was 
resting upon. There was a pause, 
then a several-barrelled sigh of disappointment. 
Pat Riley and Ham 
Sandwich said, in the one breath: 
"What is it, Archy? There's nothing 
here.' 
"Nothing? Do you call that noth- 
ing?'' and he swiftly traced upon 
the ground a form with his finger. 
"There — don't you recognize it now? 
It's Injim Billy's track. He's got 
the child." 
"God be praised!" from the mother. 
"Take away the lantern. I've got 
the direction. Follow!" 
He started on a run, racing in and 
out among the sage-bushes a matter 
of three hundred yards, and disap- 
peared over a sand-wave; the others 
struggled after him, caught him up, 
and foimd him waiting. Ten steps 
 
away was a little wickieup, a dim 
and formless shelter of rags and old 
horse-blankets, a dull light showing 
through its chinks. 
''You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the 
lad. ''It's your privilege to be 
first." 
All followed the sprint she made 
for the wickieup, and saw, with her, 
the picture its interior afforded. Injun 
Billy was sitting on the ground; tost one 
the child was asleep beside him. The 
mother hugged it with a wild embrace, 
which included Archy Stillman, the 
grateful tears running down her face, 
and in a choked and broken voice 
she poured out a golden stream of 
that wealth of worshipping endear- 
ments which has its home in full
richness nowhere but in the Irish 
he. 
" I find her b3nneby it is ten oclock' 
Billy explained. " She 'sleep out yon- 
der, ve'y tired — face wet, been cry- 
Injan's' spose; fetch her home, feed her, 
she heap much hungry — go 'sleep.'
In her limitless gratitude the happy 
mother waived rank and hugged him 
too, calling him ''the angel of God 
in disguise." 
And he probably was in disguise 
if he was that kind of an official. He 
was dressed for the character. 
At half past one in the morning 
the procession burst into the village, 
singing " When Johnny Comes March- 
ing Home," waving its lanterns, and 
swallowing the drinks that were
