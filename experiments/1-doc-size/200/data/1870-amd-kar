swallowed a bitter pang and tried to smile bravely, 
understanding that there were soldiers in common 
life as well as on the battle-field. 

Kathie did not enter at the hall door as usual, but 
at the area, in order to leave her muddy rubber boots 
down stairs. Passing the office door quietly, she 
caught a sentence, in Dr. Markham's voice, that trans- 
fixed her with surprise. 

" I really did not think she was so weak. She stood 
the operation very well, but it was as much as we 
could do to keep life in her afterward. I am afraid 
she fancies that she never will get well. Somehow, I 
shall be most sorry to have Kathie go away. The 
child is so bright and cheerful, and serves to keep up 
her spirits ' : 





Just then the door, slightly ajar, was pushed open, 
and Kathie entered, her face as white as a ghost's. 

Dr. Markham uttered an exclamation of surprise, 
and Mrs. Markham would have caught the child in 
her arms, but Kathie spoke. 

."I couldn't help hearing, Dr. Markham, and I 
know it is about Aunt Kuth. doctor, will she ever 
get well ? " 

" My dear child, physicians are sometimes power- 
less, or no one would be allowed to die ; but it seems 
quite possible to me that your aunt will recover. Do 
not distress yourself." 

" And you have had this afternoon ' 

" The second operation. The physician who has 
been here is very sanguine of perfect success, and I 
feel the same." 

Kathie's lip was quivering with intense emotion, 
and the nervous weakness that makes one want to 
cry, but she restrained herself bravely. 

" It was her wish that you should not be told," the 
doctor said, kindly, taking the little hand in his. " She 
thought it would cause you much anxiety, and it 
could not lessen her suffering, you know. She will 
be a little worse, or rather weaker, for a few days, 



 

doubtless, -but you must be courageous and hope- 
ful." The kindly eyes gave her their most encour- 
aging smile. 

" Dr. Markhani," she began, slowly, " I shall not 
go home at Christmas, or indeed until Aunt Euth 

gets well." 

" My brave child ! But is it because - 
"No" she interrupted, "I was thinking of it 
before. Dr. Markham, you don't know, but when 
Uncle Eobert came home he seemed like a prince 
from fairy-land, and he gave me three wishes. One 
was that Aunt Euth should be cured. The pain 
and suffering didn't come into my mind then. I 
only thought how splendid it would be to have her 
walk around like other people, and enjoy all the 
delightful things in the world, for we had never been 
rich before. So it is right that I should stay with 
her instead of going away for my own pleasure. I 
had made up my mind coming home, and what you 
said only strengthened it." 

Dr. Markhani looked at her in the utmost admira- 
tion. There were tears swimming upon her long 
lashes, and every feature seemed to tremble with 
the effort thus made; and Kathie appeared so sim- 





ply lovely in her pure heroism, that the doctof 
stooped and kissed her forehead. 

" My child/' he said, tenderly, " you do not know 
how much your resolve pleases me. Your aunt 
is very fragile and delicate. She has "been deprived 
of air and exercise, and doubtless overtasked her 
strength in the past clays, so that now, when all the 
vital forces are needed, she has comparatively few at 
her command. Since we have talked of this second 
operation, I think she has taken a fancy that she 
was not doing as well as she ought, and it is of the 
utmost importance that she should be kept cheerful. 
She is very fond of you, and so if you can decide 
to remain - 

" I . have already." Kathie's voice was low but 
steady. 

"God will reward you, I am sure," said Mrs. 
Markham. 

" Can I go up ? " asked Kathie, timidly. 

" Not just this moment, nay dear ; I hope she 
is asleep. And now you must try and encourage 
her, will you ? ' 

"Yes," said Kathie, under her breath, though it 
sounded almost like a sob. 



 

" Come to my room and take off your cloak," 
exclaimed Mrs. Markham. "My little darling, I 
don't wonder that they all love you, you are so 
sweet and generous." 

" Mrs. Markham, don't praise me too much ! I 
felt at first as if I could n't. The Christmas at 
Cedarwood would be so very delightful if we could 
all be together. It seems as if it was the first real 

o 

Christmas in my life." 

" And this is why I honor you for the sacrifice, 
because I know it must have been hard." 

Kathie leaned her head against the friendly bosom, 
and her tears fell silently, though they were not all 
tears of pain or disappointment. 







CHAPTEE X. 

A FRESH TRIAL. 

KATHIE could only go in and kiss Aunt Euth that 
evening. Her face was as colorless as the pillow ; 
even her lips had lost their usual pale tint, and 
somehow her features looked sharp and sunken, 
and Kathie felt, almost as if she were dying. When 
she was alone by herself in her little bed, she gave 
vent to the tears that had been so hard to repress. 

It was a little strange, perhaps, but presently 
comfort came to her in the remembrance of some 
of the old talks she and Aunt Ruth had enjoyed 
together. It made her braver and more patient, and 
brought a firmer trust in God. It did not altogether 
seem as if Tie meant to send any great trouble upon 
them, like death, when they were all so happy. In 
this Kathie forgot her own disappointment. 

The nurse remained in constant attendance on 
Sunday. Aunt Euth was too weak for conversation, 
but Kathie glanced up now and then with a bright 



 

smile. Hard as it was, she determined to follow 
Dr. Markham's wishes as near as she could, and be 
cheerful even if she did not feel quite so buoyant 
at heart. 

The event of Monday was Uncle Eobert's visit, of 
course. He had been down twice, but only for a day 
or two, and this time he did not mean to hurry 
home. He was a good deal surprised at the turn 
affairs had taken, but, after an interview with Dr. 
Markham, felt satisfied that the wisest course had 
been followed. 

Miss Jessie was delighted to see Kathie. She told 
her how all Brookside had missed her, and was laden 
with such a host of messages, from Charlie down to 
poor old Granny Thomas at the alnishouse.
