In the course of two or three years spent in 
exceptional solitude, I had read a good deal in 
the direction of my ruling thoughts and feeling, 
and came to the writing of my little book, not 
ignorant of what had been written for and by 
the mourning. The results of this reading, of 
course, went into the book, and seemed to me 
at the time by far the most useful part of it. 

How the book grew, who can say ? More of 
nature than of purpose, surely. It moved like 
a tear or a sigh or a prayer. In a sense I 
scarcely knew that I wrote it. Yet it signified 
labor and time, crude and young as it looks to 
me now ; and often as I have wondered, from 
 

my soul, why it has known the history that it 
has, I have at least a certain respect for it, my 
self, in that it did not represent shiftlessness or 
sloth, but steady and conscientious toil. There 
was not a page in it which had not been sub 
jected to such study as the writer then knew 
how to offer to her manuscripts. 

Every sentence had received the best atten 
tion which it was in the power of my 
inexperience and youth to give. I wrote and rewrote. 
The book was revised so many times that I 
could have said it by heart. The process of 
forming and writing "The Gates Ajar" lasted, 
I think, nearly two years. 

I had no study or place to myself in those 
days ; only the little room whose one window 
looked upon the garden cross, and which it was 
not expected would be warmed in winter. 

The room contained no chimney, and, until I 
was sixteen, no fire for any purpose. At that 
time, it being supposed that some delicacy of 
the lungs had threatened serious results, my 
father, who always moved the sods beneath 
him and the skies above him to care for a sick 
child, had managed to insert a little stove into 
the room, to soften its chill when needed. But 
I did not have consumption, only life ; and one 
was not expected to burn wood all day for 
private convenience in our furnace-heated house. 


Was there not the great dining-room where the 
children studied ? 

It was not so long since I, too, had learned 
my lessons off the dining-room table, or in the 
corner by the register, that it should occur to 
any member of the family that these opportu 
nities for privacy could not answer my needs. 

Equally, it did not occur to me to ask for any 
abnormal luxuries. I therefore made the best 
of my conditions, though I do remember sorely 
longing for quiet. 

This, at that time, in that house, it was
impossible for me to compass. There was a grow 
ing family of noisy boys, four of them, of 
whom I was the only sister, as I was the old 
est child. When the baby did not cry (I have 
always maintained that the baby cried pretty 
steadily both day and night, but this is a point 
upon which their mother and I have affection 
ately agreed to differ), the boys were shouting 
about the grounds, chasing each other through 
the large house, up and down the cellar stairs, 
and through the wide halls, a whirlwind of 
vigor and fun. They were merry, healthy boys, 
and everything was done to keep them so. I 
sometimes doubt if there are any happier
children growing anywhere than the boys and girls 
of Andover used to be. I was very fond of 
the boys, and cherished no objection to their 

 



privileges in the house. But when one went 
down, on a cold day, to the register, to write 
one's chapter on the nature of amusements in 
the life to come, and found the dining-room 
neatly laid out in the form of a church congre 
gation, to which a certain proportion of brothers 
were enthusiastically performing the duties of 
an active pastor and parish, the environment 
was a definite check to inspiration. 

I wonder if all Andover boys played at 
preaching? It certainly was the one sport in our 
house which never satiated. 

Coming in one day, I remember, struggling 
with certain hopeless purposes of my own, for 
an afternoon's work, I found the dining-room 
chairs all nicely set in the order of pews ; a 
table, ornamented with Bible and hymn-books, 
confronted them ; behind it, on a cricket, 
towered the bigger brother, loudly holding forth. 
The little brother represented the audience 
it was usually the little one who was forced to 
play this duller role and, with open mouth, 
and with wriggling feet turned in on the rounds 
of the chair, absorbed as much exhortation as 
he could suffer. 

"My text, brethren," said the little minister, 
" is, * Suffer the little children to come unto 
me. " Pausing here to make a fit and full 
impression he solemnly proceeded : 


"My subject is, God ; Joseph ; and Moses in 
the bulrushes ! " 

Discouraged by the alarming breadth of the 
little preacher's topic, I fled upstairs again. 
There an inspiration did, indeed, strike me ; for 
I remembered an old fur cape, ox pelisse, of my 
mother s, out of fashion, but the warmer for 
that ; and straightway I got me into it, and 
curled up, with my papers, on the chilly bed in 
the cold room, and went to work. 

It seems to me that a good part of "The 
Gates Ajar " was written in that old fur cape. 
Often I stole up into the attic, or into some 
unfrequented closet, to escape the noise of the 
house while at work. I remember, too, writing 
sometimes in the barn, on the haymow. 
The book extended over a wide domestic to 
pography. 

I hasten to say that no person was to blame 
for inconveniences of whose existence I had 
never complained. Doubtless something would 
have been done to relieve them had I asked for 
it ; or if the idea that my work could ever be 
of any consequence had occurred to any of us. 
Why should it ? The girl who is never " do 
mestic " is trial enough at her best. She can 
not cook ; she will not sew. She washes dishes 
Mondays and Tuesdays under protest, while 
the nurse and parlor maid are called off from 
 

their natural avocations, and dusts the drawing- 
room with resentful obedience. She sits cutting 
out underclothes in the March vacations, 
when all the schools are closed, and when the 
heavy wagons from the distant farming region 
stick in the bottomless Andover mud in front 
of the professor's house. The big front door 
is opened, and the dismal, creaking sounds 
come in. 

The kind and conscientious new mother, to 
whom I owe many other gentle lessons more 
valuable than this, teaches how necessary to a 
lady's education is a neat needle. 

The girl does not deny this elemental fact ; 
but her eyes wander away to the cold sky above 
the Andover mud, with passionate entreaty. 
To this day I cannot hear the thick chu-chunk ! 
of heavy wheels on March mud without a sud 
den mechanical echo of that wild, young outcry : 
" Must I cut out underclothes forever ? Must 
I go on tucking the broken end of the thread 
into the nick in the spool ? Is this LIFE ? " 

I am more than conscious that I could not 
have been an easy girl to "bring up," and am 
sure that for whatever little difficulties beset 
the earlier time of my ventures as a writer, no 
person was in any fault. They were doubtless 
good for me, in their way. We all know that 
some of the greatest of brain-workers have 
selected the poorest and barest of spots in which 
to study. Luxury and bric-a-brac come to easy 
natures or in easy years. The energy that very 
early learns to conquer difficulty is always worth 
its price. 

I used, later, to hear in Boston the story of 
the gentleman who once took a friend to see 
the room of his son at Harvard College. The 
friend was a man of plain life, but of rich men 
tal achievement. He glanced at the Persian 
rugs and costly draperies of the boy's quarters
