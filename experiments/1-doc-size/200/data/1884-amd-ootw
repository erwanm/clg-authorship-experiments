of poverty. You may make sacrifices for yourself, but to 



 

offer the sweet, innocent souls of your children to the 
crushing, devouring Moloch, to see them grow • hard and 
common before your eyes, compelled to minister to the 
miserable weakness of one who has lost all regard for 
them ! His kindness helped me to rescue them. Judge, 
then, how much gratitude I owe him. That is the bond 
between us. And, since you have unconsciously added to 
it, let me say in all truth there is no one to whom I 
would so soon owe another favor save to yourself." 

The fine, calm eyes were passion-pure. Never in that 
old time had she loved this man, Thierry felt, no matter 
what sentiment might have actuated him then. 

" More than a year ago the obligation ceased. Since 
then I have not seen him. If you think it best, for Celia's 
sake, will you say that I am ready to welcome any friend, 
but — I am not a free woman — " she stood up proud 
and straight before him, her brow marble clear. " Having 
saved my children from one evil, I have no right to bring 
another upon them." 

"Yes, I understand." He took her slender fingers in 
his with a respect that thrilled her. " For Celia's sake I 
am glad to count him her friend." 

She stood looking after him when he had gone, but 
seeing only vacancy, and thinking how strange it was 
that fate should have sent Mr. Howarth into her child's 
life when she had held back for very fear. 

Thierry walked briskly down the street, pondering the 
strange tangle as well. Howarth's money had helped her 
to complicate her life, and yet, what would it have been 
without the assistance ? How odd that he had stumbled 
upon this very point ! 

Celia's joy was too delicious an emotion to dampen. 
Up to this time Mrs. Marshall had allowed herself to be 
disturbed by fears of an over-sanguine verdict. In her 
wider knowledge of the world she knew the struggle that 
lay before Celia, the hard fight it would be to win back the 





lost vantage-ground. Yet she had the boundless hope of 
youth that believes all things possible, while the mother 
had gathered much sad lore by experience. 

Paul Thierry puzzled his brains a long while to plan 
how a meeting could be brought about with no embar- 
rassment to any party. That Mrs. Marshall was not a 
free woman, that she had a peculiar position to sustain in 
the eyes of the world, complicated it. 

Mrs. Howarth cut the Gordian knot, innocent of any 
secret intent in it. Thierry met her at an art reception, 
where he was wandering around forlornly. The Van 
CI eves had some interruption at the last moment. Mrs. 
Thierry declared she was too tired to take doses of art 
conversation. The artist was to meet some committee, bo 
he went off grumbling, — quite an unusual temper for him. 

Mrs. Howarth put out her hand as she sat in an easy- 
chair, a little fatigued from exertion. 

" Oh, how glad I am to see you," he said. " I began to 
think my familiars had mostly disappeared. There are so 
many new faces to-night, and so many old ones have 
been turned country-ward or mountain-ward." 

" Sit down here," and she motioned to a chair. "Mr. 
Howarth is showing about two very aesthetic young ladies, 
strangers in the city. And I want to thank you for the 
lovely surprise you placed in his way. How well you 
knew what would suit me ! I felt complimented to think 
that you considered the rightful owner of such a picture 
should be Stacy Van Cleve or myself. And Mr. Howarth 
said you would relate the romance points of the story. 
The artist is your pupil and very young ; and he knew her 
mother long ago, he tells me. But all the remainder I 
was to extract from you, and you know you are always 
stumbling over romantic people." 

" Am I ? Howarth insists that one half my swans are 
geese ! I wish I could interest you in her behalf; " and 
he glanced wistfully at the lady. 



 

" I am interested already. Does that mean that you 
want me to take her up ? Shall I give her a reception ? " 

"I wonder if you would have the courage to ?" 

" Does it require courage ? Isn't she presentable ? n 

" She is a very lovely young girl. I do not mean with 
merely a pretty face, but her figure is exquisitely graceful, 
her air quaint and serious, her voice low and trained, her 
manners refined, her intelligence quite up to the average. 
I am not sure but she has some accomplishments." 

" What are the defects? though I cannot see that you 
have left room for any." 

" Poverty for one." 

"But how does she come by all these charms and 
graces ? " There was an amused light in Mrs. Howarth's 
eye. 

" Her mother is a lady." 

" Well, poverty is an accident that befalls many of us. 
There are changes of that kind going on continually. 
And now about the father ? " 

" Her father is worse than dead ; indeed, the only hope 
about him is that he may be dead. For three years or 
more the mother has made her way, with her children to 
care for. The crime society will bring against her is, 
that she is a business woman." 

" Paul Thierry ! As if we were not all outgrowing that ! 
What an absurd idea for you to advance ! " 

"Are we outgrowing it? I am not so sure. Certain 
kinds of accomplishments are allowed the privilege of 
coining money, if they can with no detriment to social 
position. We talk a great deal about making labor re- 
spected, but we do shrink a little from respecting the 
laborer. He seems a useful piece of machinery that we 
can admire as one of the parts of a grand theory, but we 
like best to poise him at a distance. And a woman is made 
to feel the disadvantages more keenly. You are not 
always remembering that an elegant and cultivated man 





of present luxury was once engaged in some inferior em- 
ployment." 

" But — allow me to offset this with one question — are 
your people of inferior employment always cultured and 
refined ? That they often do succeed to wealth I admit." 

"We will premise that they had all at first, as the 
mother of my little artist unquestionably did. Then 
comes bravely borne misfortune. Instead of sinking down 
and drifting about in search of the proper vantage ground, 
she took hold with a firm grasp of the work that came in 
her way, and succeeded." 

" And that was ? — " 

" Millinery ! " 

Mrs. Howarth's level brows rose the least trifle un- 
consciously. 

" She had the taste, the genius for that. She has made 
a home and is educating her children. But I am well 
aware that as a prima donna, a literary woman, or even an 
artist, it would have enhanced her social value. This is 
what I complain of, and it seems to be the weak point of 
the woman and the industrial questions." 

" How does Mrs. Thierry take it? " 

" Ah, you know that Mrs. Thierry is a born aristocrat, 
and that I pay my price for superior civilization" — he 
gave the merest elevation to his shoulders, and a light, 
humorous smile crossed his face. " Mrs. Marshall makes 
Mrs. Thierry look so transcendently lovely in new bon- 
nets that I go near to ruining myself in order to be the 
more deeply captivated. But to Mrs. Thierry the stain 
of labor on white hands is the unpardonable sin — as bad 
as Lady Macbeth's ; and the perfumes of the whole Orient 
cannot wash it out." 

" I wonder you and Marguerite never quarrel," she said, 
with a peculiar smile. 

" Does a man go out and hale his heliotrope bed that it 
has not borne him Jacqueminot roses ? I have a fondness
