bitterly. Was it indeed too late ? O, if he could persuade 
Robert to return for one brief act of justice ! 

Under any circumstances Mother Davis's was no proper 
place for Margaret. He must provide a new home with some 
one whose kindness and discretion were undoubted out of 
the reach of idle gossip, yet not too far from him. He could 
not yield her entirely to stranger hands. Who would take 
a motherly interest in this poor, friendless child ? 

For several days he revolved the perplexing subject. Mabel 
wondered to see him so entirely pre-occupied. But he had 
never been tenderer to the children. 

Some conversation he was holding with a patient one day 
concerning a nurse, recalled to his mind a lady his father had 
placed great confidence in a childless widow, who had for- 
merly supported herself by attending the sick. About the 
time of Dr. Bertrand's death she had removed to a pretty 
country place, in order to take care of her father-in-law, who 
had been left entirely alone by the death of his last daughter. 
She possessed one of those full, cheerful natures that invari- 



 

ably carry sunshine with them at every step. He had called 
occasionally at the little cottage, when business took him in 
that direction, for Mr. Wilcox was both old and infirm. He 
knew, too, that the daughter-in-law eked out her small in- 
come by taking a boarder or two in the summer. The season 
would be over now, and he might persuade her to take charge 
of Margaret. She would be trusty and kind ; the place waa 
secluded, yet with Mrs. Wilcox one could hardly be lone- 
some. It was worth trying, at all events. 







CHAPTER XVII. 

O sweet, pale Margaret ! 

O rare, pale Margaret ! 
What lit your eyes with tearful power, 
Like moonlight on a falling shower? 
Who lent you, love, your mortal dower ? 

TENNYSON. 

THE sun was going westward as Dr. Bertrand rode 
through the main street of the pretty town of Orange, 
turned to the right, and passed Llewellyn Park, whose 
short, crisp grass and groups of beautiful trees were tinted 
with the tawny hues of an autumn sunset. The bright yel- 
lows and flaming reds of the ripening leaves gave a warm 
coloring to the lovely landscape. He only glanced at it ; in 
his heart rang an echo of cool, sweet tones, more musical 
than this plashing wayside brook ; and the vision of a sad, 
tender face came between him and this dreamy beauty. 

He turned down a by-road, and soon paused before a lit- 
tle tasteful cottage, almost hidden by two giant sycamores, 
through which you caught glimpses of a pointed roof and a 
vine-covered porch. There was a small front yard, gay 
with late flowers of brilliant beauty ; and a wide piazza at 
the side, with two entrances one nearly in the centre, the 
other at the farther end. 

He fastened his horse, and walked up the path, bordered 
with scarlet geraniums. Old Mr. Wilcox sat in the hall, 
his withered hands clasped over the head of his cane. His 
face was placid, and his kind blue eyes still shone with 
human interest, though the silver of nearly fourscore years 
rested on his straggling locks. 

" Good evening, Dr. Bertram!. I'm glad to see you 



 

once again ; " and he shook hands, warmly, calling, a mo- 
ment after, " Mary ! " 

Mrs. Wilcox answered the summons. Fair, rosy, and 
well kept, with a genial face and hearty, pleasing voice. 

" Why, Dr. Bertrand, what a surprise ! You are a great 
stranger ; " and she placed a chair for him. 

There was some general conversation, which happened to 
turn at length on the fine season it had been for fruit ; and 
Mr. Wilcox proposed Mary should take the doctor through 
the garden, and see if she could not find a peach or a pear 
for him. He rose with alacrity. 

" Father is childish about the garden," she exclaimed, 
with a smile. " But we have done remarkably well with it 
this summer." 

" I am obliged to him for sending us out," Richard re- 
turned. " I wanted to see you particularly, and ask a great 
favor." 

" A favor ? " she repeated, in surprise. 

" Yes ; are your boarders gone ? " 

" They leave next week. Old Mrs. McLean is very fee- 
ble. I doubt if she ever comes again." 

" Would you object to having any one through the winter ?" 

" dear, no. Winter is a lonely time with me. I can't 
leave father, except to run into the nearest neighbor's, and 
sometimes I feel quite lost. My old life used to be so 
busy ! " 

" I must tell my story first, and then trust your kindness. 
There is scarcely any one else I could apply to, except a 
perfect stranger." Then, after a long pause, he simply 
said, " Robert was privately married last February," and 
gave the main incidents of neglect and desertion. He spoke 
touchingly of Margaret her youth, her friendlessness, 
her unfavorable surroundings, ^and the urgent necessity of 
her being in good hands ; ending with, " It would be utterly 
impossible for me to take her home at this juncture, even if 
I wanted to." 





"Even if he wanted to ! " That, to Mrs. Wilcox, impli'ed 
his unwillingness. She fancied she understood Dr. Ber- 
trand's feelings. Robert's wife was not just the woman he 
cared to have on an equality with his sisters, but his gener- 
ous disposition would not allow him to act in the heartless 
manner Robert had. Her pity was deeply stirred, and after 
a few perplexing revolutions of her mind, she said, 

" Yes ; I think I could take her." 

The expression of relief in Richard's face repaid her. 

" Thank you a thousand times ! " he exclaimed, warmly. 
" I wish you could see her first ; but, believe me, it will be 
quite impossible not to take her to your heart at once." 

" Your recommendation is amply sufficient. I only hope 
she will be satisfied." 

" I can answer for her. When may she come ? " 

" The 1st of October, if she pleases. And your frequent 
visits will be a decided comfort. Indeed," she continued, 
wanning with her subject, since she had resolved upon it, 
" you may set your heart entirely at rest about the secret. 
Her coming from New York will cover all questions ; and I 
have no very curious acquaintances here." 

" You have done me an invaluable kindness," Richard 
said, in a heartfelt tone. " You are sharing a great bur- 
den with me." 

So the next morning he went to New York with a lighter 
heart. His impatience to see Margaret was so great that 
he could hardly endure settling the preliminaries with Mrs. 
Davis, though she readily relinquished Margaret to his care. 

He hurried up stairs to the child's room. How neat and 
faultless its appointments were ! The daintily flowered car- 
pet, the light, graceful chairs, a red and white willow work- 
stand, books and pictures ; nothing very costly, but all things 
evincing true and elegant taste. And there was Margaret, 
robed in a French print, with pale tinted ground and minut- 
est flowers in lovely coloring. At the throat and wrists it 
was relieved with soft ruffles, and instead of a brooch, she 



 

wofe a deep, velvety rose and bud. Her hair was smooth 
and glossy ; her feet, in tiny resetted slippers, seemed the 
extreme of neatness. There was such a regard for finish in 
detail about her, that Richard wondered how she had man- 
aged to retain her love of order and beauty in this place. 

She was shy and distant this morning. Indeed, she could 
not divest herself of a feeling that Dr. Bertrand was dis- 
pleased, and justly so, at her imprudent marriage with his 
brother. Mrs. Davis's present haste to consign her to other 
hands wounded her deeply. From the grave face before 
her she judged every duty would be steadfastly performed,
