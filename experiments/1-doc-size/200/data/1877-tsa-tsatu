voices of his children, going up in their evening 
prayer, and from the chamber in which they 
kneeled by their mother he has gone back 
through nearly forty years to another chamber 
and another mother. The treasure-house of good 
affections and pious thoughts, stored in infancy 
and childhood, is unlocked now. He has gone in 
among its precious things, and comprehending 
their value, he says " Love is left and duty 
and God 's kingdom, into which we may enter by 
love and duty." It was by misfortune that the 
key came into his hands. And so in the loss of 
worldly treasure, he has found the way to a store 
house of celestial riches. 

" When this cup touched my lips." It is still 
later in the evening, and there has been long and 
earnest communion with the past, the present, and 
the future. "When this cup touched my lips," 
Mrs. Lea is speaking " its bitterness made me 
shudder ; yet, now I can see that it brought me 
water from a sweet fountain. I am happier to- 



 

night than I was one year ago, when no dread of 
the storm that has swept over us sent a chill to 
my heart. There is a foundation, dear husband, 
on which we may build and rest secure, though 
the floods beat, and the tempests rage." 

" Let us build thereon," is answered in low, 
earnest tones, " a building that shall endure for 
ever." 




 



IV. 

COMFORTED. 

drawn curtains stillness; such deep 
^ surrounding stillness that breathing was audi 
ble. In this dimness and silence sat, through 
the long days, refusing to be comforted, a mother 
who had lost her child : Not a child in the in 
nocence of infancy, but in the fragrance and pu 
rity of young womanhood. 

A sorrow like this is hard to bear. It touches 
the very springs of life, and dashes their waters 
with bitterness. It weighs down the heart with a 
burden that makes every pulsation weak and 
painful. Clouds envelop the sun and the earth 
is in shadow. 

" If I could only see her in my dreams," said 
Mrs. Ellsworth to a friend, who had left the out 
side cheerful world, and come into the gloomy 



 

apartment where the bereaved one sat nursing her 
sorrow. " If I could only see her in my dreams, 
it would be something. But since the day her 
face was shut from me by the coffin lid, neither 
to outward sight nor inward vision has it again 
been visible. Through how many hours of the 
night have I kept awake, hoping that I'm ight see 
her in the darkness. I was not afraid. Dear, 
dear child ! She has gone from me as completely 
as if I were sailing over an ocean, and she had 
dropped down into its fathomless depths. Is 
there no return of our beloved? My faith begins 
to fail. I had not thought of the spiritual world 
as very distant. T had believed the separating 
veil but thin. Thought gives presence, and love 
conjunction, as to the spirit, whether we be in the 
body or out of the body ; so I had said, and so I 
had believed. But now I sit and think of Mar 
garet for hours, yet do not perceive her presence." 
The friend made no attempt to meet the state 
of Mrs. Ellsworth by theory or doctrine. She 
understood her case, and knew that there was no 



 

comfort in words. So after sitting silent for a. 
little while, she said 

" You knew Mrs. Garland ?" 

"Yes." 

" Have you heard about her ?" 

" No ! what about her ?" 

" Not that her husband was killed at Gettys 
burg?" 

" Why, no ! Killed at Gettysburg !" 

"Yes; and what makes the case sadder, his 
body could not be found. She will never know 
the place of his burial !" 

" Have you seen her ?" asked Mrs. Ellsworth. 

"No; my acquaintance was too slight to war 
rant intrusion. But you were an intimate friend, 
I think." 

"We have been quite intimate. Poor Mrs. 
Garland ! How does she bear this terrible afflic 
tion ?" 

"I have not happened to meet with any one 
who has visited her." 

Mi s. Ellsworth, who had been sitting in a Ian- 



 

guid attitude, almost too spiritless to move, loft 
her chair, and began walking about the room. A 
new interest had been awakened in her mind. 
The grief of a friend had for the moment over 
shadowed her own. 

"You will go and see her?" suggested the 
visitor. 

Mrs. Ellsworth stood still. She had not been 
out of her house scarcely out of her chamber 
since her daughter 's death. 

" The words of a very near friend give comfort 
in sorrow. The heart is sustained by sympathy," 

" We are near and dear friends ; her affliction 
is heavier than mine; I will go to her," said Mrs. 
Ellsworth. 

Temperaments are different, and so are the 
principles on which character is based. No two 
minds bear sorrow alike. The heart of Mrs. 
Ellsworth failed her as she crossed the threshold 
of her friend 's dwelling. She had come to offer 
the comfort of her presence not to deal in fruit 
less words and now she felt that even her pre- 



 

sence could only add gloom to the darkness in 
which Mrs. Garland was enshrouded. A few 
moments of waiting, and then a servant invited 
her up stairs. The chamber in which she found 
her friend was not in twilight shadows, but cheer 
ful with tempered light. As she entered, she met 
a pale, suffering face, and eyes running over. 
The face hid itself on her bosom. Tears mingled 
with tears, and sobs answered to sobs. 

" It was so kind in you to come," said Mrs. 
Garland, as they sat down together. "I have 
thought of you so many times, and wished to see 
you." 

A baby sat on the floor a baby ten months 
old. His nurse had gone down stairs. He was 
half alarmed at the presence of a stranger, and 
put up his hands to be taken. His mother lifted 
him into her arms, and he nestled his head close 
down against her bosom, but with his eyes on 
Mrs. Ellsworth 's face. 

" Dear baby !" said Mrs. Ellsworth, the mois 
ture glistening in her eyes.
