" What am I going to do ? Nothing. The boy ? He 
must take his chances. Let him grow up under the new 
rtgime ; I have told him nothing of the old. It may be that 
he will prosper ; people do prosper, they tell me. It seems 
we were wrong, all wrong ; then we must be very right now, 
for the blacks are our judges, councilors, postmasters, repre 
sentatives, and law-makers. That is as it should be, isn't it ? 
What ! not so ? But how can it be otherwise ? Ah, you 
think that a new king will arise who knows not Joseph that 
is, that a new generation will come to whom these questions 



 

will be things of the past. It may be so ; I do not know. I 
do not know anything certainly any more, for my world has 
been torn asunder, and I am uprooted and lost. No, you can 
not help me, no one can help me. I can not adjust myself to 
the new order of things ; I can not fit myself in new soil ; the 
fibers are broken. Leave me alone, and give your help to the 
young ; they can profit by it. The child ? Well, if if you 
really wish it, I will not oppose you. Take him, and bring 
him up in your rich, prosperous North ; the South has no 
place for him. Go, and God speed you ! But, as for me, I 
will abide in mine own country. It will not be until such as 
I have gone from earth that the new blood can come to her. 
Let us alone ; we will watch the old life out with her, and 
when her new dawning comes we shall have joined our dead, 
and all of us, our errors, our sins, and our sufferings will be 
forgotten." 



Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven 
With intricate shades of the vines that, myriad cloven, 
Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs. 

.... Green colonnades 

Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods, 
Of the heavenly woods and glades, 
That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within 
The wide sea-marshes of Glynn. 

.... Free 

By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea. 
Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band 
Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land. 

Inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and 

curl 
As a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows the firm, sweet limbs of 

a girl. 

A league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade, 
Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade. 

SIDNEY LAMER. 

CHRISTINE and I found her there. She was a small, dark- 
skinned, yellow-eyed child, the offspring of the ocean and the 
heats, tawny, lithe and wild, shy yet fearless not unlike one 
of the little brown deer that bounded through the open reaches 
of the pine-barren behind the house. She did not come to 
us we came to her ; we loomed into her life like genii from 
another world, and she was partly afraid and partly proud of 
us. For were we not her guests ? proud thought ! and, bet 
ter still, were we not women ? "I have only seen three wo 
men in all my life," said Felipa, inspecting us gravely, " and I 
like women. I am a woman too, although these clothes of 
the son of Pedro make me appear as a boy ; I wear them on 



 

account of the boat and the hauling in of the fish. The son 
of Pedro being dead at a convenient age, and his clothes fit 
ting me, what would you have ? It was a chance not to be 
despised. But when I am grown I shall wear robes long and 
beautiful like the senora s." The little creature was dressed 
in a boy's suit of dark-blue linen, much the worse for wear, 
and torn. 

" If you are a girl, why do you not mend your clothes? " 
I said. 

" Do you mend, senora ? " 

" Certainly : all women sew and mend." 

" The other lady ? " 

Christine laughed as she lay at ease upon the brown car 
pet of pine-needles, warm and aromatic after the tropic day's 
sunshine. " The child has divined me already, Catherine," 
she said. 

Christine was a tall, lissome maid, with an unusually long 
stretch of arm, long sloping shoulders, and a long fair throat ; 
her straight hair fell to her knees when unbound, and its clear 
flaxen hue had not one shade of gold, as her clear gray eyes 
had not one shade of blue. Her small, straight, rose-leaf lips 
parted over small, dazzlingly white teeth, and the outline of 
her face in profile reminded you of an etching in its distinct 
ness, although it was by no means perfect according to the 
rules of art. Still, what a comfort it was, after the blurred out 
lines and smudged profiles many of us possess seen to best 
advantage, I think, in church on Sundays, crowned with flower- 
decked bonnets, listening calmly serene to favorite ministers, 
unconscious of noses ! When Christine had finished her 
laugh and she never hurried anything she stretched out 
her arm carelessly and patted Felipa's curly head. The child 
caught the descending hand and kissed the long white fingers. 

It was a wild place where we were, yet not new or crude 
the coast of Florida, that old-new land, with its deserted plan 
tations, its skies of Paradise, and its broad wastes open to the 
changeless sunshine. The old house stood on the edge of the 




dry land, where the pine-barren ended and the salt-marsh 
began ; in front curved the tide-water river that seemed ever 
trying to come up close to the barren and make its acquaint 
ance, but could not quite succeed, since it must always turn 
and flee at a fixed hour, like Cinderella at the ball, leaving not 
a silver slipper behind, but purple driftwood and bright sea 
weeds, brought in from the Gulf Stream outside. A planked 
platform ran out into the marsh from the edge of the barren, 
and at its end the boats were moored ; for, although at high 
tide the river was at our feet, at low tide it was far away out 
in the green waste somewhere, and if we wanted it we must 
go and seek it. We did not want it, however ; we let it glide 
up to us twice a day with its fresh salt odors and flotsam of 
the ocean, and the rest of the time we wandered over the bar 
rens or lay under the trees looking up into the wonderful blue 
above, listening to the winds as they rushed across from sea 
to sea. I was an artist, poor and painstaking. Christine was 
my kind friend. She had brought me South because my cough 
was troublesome, and here because Edward Bowne recom 
mended the place. He and three fellow sportsmen were down 
at the Madre Lagoon, farther south ; I thought it probable we 
should see him, without his three fellow sportsmen, before 
very long. 

" Who were the three women you have seen, Felipa ? " 
said Christine. 

" The grandmother, an Indian woman of the Seminoles 
who comes sometimes with baskets, and the wife of Miguel 
of the island. But they are all old, and their skins are curled : 
I like better the silver skin of the sefiora." 

Poor little Felipa lived on the edge of the great salt-marsh 
alone with her grandparents, for her mother was dead. The 
yellow old couple were slow-witted Minorcans, part pagan, 
part Catholic, and wholly ignorant; their minds rarely rose 
above the level of their orange-trees and their fish-nets. 
Felipa's father was a Spanish sailor, and, as he had died only 
the year before, the child's Spanish was fairly correct, and we 



 

could converse with her readily, although we were slow to 
comprehend the patois of the old people, which seemed to 
borrow as much from the Italian tongue and the Greek as 
from its mother Spanish. " I know a great deal," Felipa remarked confidently, " for my father taught me. He had sailed 
on the ocean out of sight of land, and he knew many things. 
These he taught to me. Do the gracious ladies think there is 
anything else to know ? " 

One of the gracious ladies thought not, decidedly. In 
answer to my remonstrance, expressed in English, she said, 
" Teach a child like that, and you ruin her." 

" Ruin her?" 

" Ruin her happiness the same thing." 

Felipa had a dog, a second self a great gaunt yellow 
creature of unknown breed, with crooked legs, big feet, and 
the name Drollo. What Drollo meant, or whether it was an 
abbreviation, we never knew ; but there was a certain satis 
faction in it, for the dog was droll : the fact that the Minorcan 
title, whatever it was, meant nothing of that sort, made it all 
the better. We never saw Felipa without Drollo. " They 
look a good deal alike," observed Christine " the same col 
oring." 

" For shame ! " I said.
