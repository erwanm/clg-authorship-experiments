but never-resting feet which trod the dust of Pales- 
tine over in search of unhappy people whom he 
could comfort. 

The storm of her tears became a deluge, and 
drenched the bare feet of the Rabbi where they 
lay upon the low cushions of his couch. She was 
half frightened at this, and, seeing what she had 
done, she hurriedly wiped away the wetness with 
her thick long hair. She tried to stop crying, but 
could not. Suddenly he felt a strange thing. 
The lips of the woman had touched his feet ; timid 
and reverent and delicate kisses fell one upon 
another, an outburst of humiliation and adora- 
tion such as the lowest soul on earth might offer 
to the highest God in heaven. The woman had 
reached one of those moments of spiritual exalta- 
tion when one neither knows nor cares what may 
happen next. Until she saw and heard the pro- 
phet, she had not understood what disgrace meant. 
Now, at the very crisis when she first had know- 
ledge of the nature of shame, she had her first ex- 
perience of a communication between God and the 
soul, we give it different names : repentance, or 
forgiveness, or some word which is all too definite 
to hold it ; but the most that we know is, that 
there is a beautiful mystery which extinguishes 
shame and never tells us how. 

She forgot the angry host, the sneering company ; 
even the silence of the Jtabbi himself ceased to

trouble her. She Had forgotten herself, her misery, 
and her error. She remembered nothing in the 
world but him. 

The little, white alabastron had fallen from her 
trembling hand and hung forward by its chain. She 
took it up and unsealed it. One of the powerful 
perfumes of the East flowed out pungently and filled 
the air of the diniiig-halL The alabaster vial con- 
tained a precious, scented unguent, much favored by 
all classes of society that could afford it. The wo- 
man poured it out lavishly, covering her hands and 
the feet of the Nazarene with it, while she humbly 
anointed them. She asked for nothing; not even 
a sign that would give her a breath of confidence 
in the new feeling which she had begun to dare to 
call respect for herself. She only offered all she 
had or could. She was sorry, and happy, and dif- 
ferent. She wanted the Rabbi to understand. She 
longed that he should know how she felt about him. 

Up to this time the Nazarene had not spoken ; but 
his delicate features had shown many varying and 
fine emotions during the progress of this touching 
scene. Now, unexpectedly, he spoke. But he spoke 
to his host, who, restrained by politeness from inter- 
fering with the conduct of his guest during this 
unprecedented episode, had taken no pains to con- 
ceal either his displeasure or his personal skepticism 
in the matter. 

" Simon," observed Jesus suddenly, " if this man 
were a prophet, he would have known what kind of 
a woman she is who touched him." 

The face of the Pharisee crimsoned with embar- 



196 THE STOBY OP JESUS CHEIST 

rassment, for in these precise words his thought had 
been at that moment cast. The Nazarene read him 
as if he had been a Hebrew scroll. Simon flung 
out his hands in Oriental deprecation, but Ms eyes 
dropped. With a quiet sarcasm, all the more cut- 
ting because perfectly courteous, Jesus proceeded to 
suggest the number and variety of social attentions 
omitted in his own case by his host. No one had 
anointed the visitor's head when he came in. He 
had observed the absence of the Oriental kiss of 
greeting. Nay, even the usual courtesy, the com- 
monest one of all, had been overlooked by careless 
servants whom a none too careful master had not 
rebuked for their neglect. This country Rabbi had 
not been so ignorant of the world, after all! He 
had noted the slight of every little lapse of etiquette. 
And, worst of all, he had detected his host in the 
very breach of it most galling to a Pharisee. For 
Simon belonged to the sect whose god was an inces- 
sant lavation. A Pharisee might cheat, or lie, or 
oppress, or evict his tenants, or slander, or do as he 
pleased about the moral law; but he knew which 
way every drop of water ought to run, and fully ex- 
pected to bathe his soul into the kingdom of Heaveii. 
An eminent Sadducee once said of a distinguished 
Pharisee that he would wash the sun itself, if he could 
get at it. 

The woman was still weeping. She could not 
altogether follow the conversation which now took 
place at the table, partly because she was crying so, 
partly because it was so foreign to her habit of mind 
that it was not easy for her to understand it. But 



THE HABBI, ASD THE TTO31AX 197 

she soon perceived that it concerned herself, and 
began to concentrate her attention upon it. Was 
the Rabbi saying a kind thing of her her ? In- 
credible ! 

" Thou, Simon, didst not kiss me, nor anoint, nor 
give me any water for my feet. But she has washed 
my feet with her tears, . . . wiped them with her 
hair, . . . anointed them; . . . she has not yet 
ceased to kiss my feet." 

The words were said in a low tone, but the humil- 
iated woman heard them with broken distinctness. 
For very joy and awe she stopped weeping ; sud- 
denly, like a comforted child. Impossible! Did 
she hear correctly? Was she deaf, or dazed? 

"She has loved much. . . . Much is forgiven 
her." 

Did the Rabbi, could the Rabbi, say that? 

She raised her tear-stained face, pushed her liair 
back from it, and courageously lifted her head. 

Oh, wonderful ! He had turned to her at last. 
His glorious eyes, like altar fires, were lighted for 
her. His grave lip, fine with feeling, moved for her. 
His pity, now she knew what his pity was I His 
own heart seemed to ache or break with it. It gave 
her a bewildering feeling, she a ci'eature scorned 
and stained, as if, for his sake, because he pitied 
her she must have value, she must be worth what it 
cost him to think of her as he did. 

His exquisite compassion, tenderer than woman's, 
stronger than man's, a quality undreamed of before 
in the world, seemed to lift her from the dust to 
the stars. Jesus regarded the woman for some 



198 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

minutes in one of the profound silences for which 
his manner was distinguished. He seemed to be 
gauging her nature, taking careful account of her 
genuineness, whether it would hold or not. His 
next words vere the result of careful reflection, and, 
when they came, no one in the room wondered that 
they were uttered with the solemnity of a man who 
weighs the full force and consequence of what he 
says. 

" Thy sins," he slowly said, " are forgiven thee." 

" Are forgiven me ! " she repeated with pathetic 
incredulity, "forgiven we?" She had fallen 
upon the floor before his blinding face. Now she 
raised herself awkwardly to her feet. He did not 
extend his hand to help her. She felt that it de- 
pended on herself from this hour how she stood 
before the world. She walked tottering but erect. 
His look was as if it would dismiss her ; perhaps as 
if he would spare her the inevitable consequences 
of this scene, and shelter her from rude comment, 
in solitude, and in white thoughts. 

" Go," he added gently, " and in peace," With 
lifted head and shining eyes she went. Not a sneer 
from the coldest lip in the company followed her out. 
No one smiled. The servants made way for her 
without a glance of disrespect. She did not even 
look back at the Rabbi, for she felt that he would 
not wish it. The silken curtain parted and fell; 
and in the thrilling echo of his last great words she 
was gone. 

The woman had gone, but the fact remained. The 
Kabbi had done a wholly reprehensible and danger-
