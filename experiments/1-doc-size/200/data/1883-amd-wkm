sends them to such people, when there is many a hunger- 
ing soul that would welcome a baby. But young people 
rush into marriage without thinking of the sacred respon- 
sibility." And Mrs. Fleming checked herself suddenly, 
coloring. " Is the poor thing any better?" she asked. 

' ' She can never be restored in mind ; otherwise she is 
well, " Mr. Conover made answer. 

There was a brief pause, and then Mrs. Alston said in 
a low, gentle tone : 

" We have decided, my brother and I, that the proper 
place for the child is with us, since its mother will never 
be competent to care for it. But she is so fond of you, I 
hardly know how we will be able to get her home. Robert, 
it will tux your ingenuity." And she smiled. 

" I should like to keep her always." The tears came in 
Mrs. Fleming's eyes. "If the parents had been very 
poor, I should have proposed it, but I could only bring her 
up plainly." 

Mrs. Alston felt self-condemned. Not that she should 





ever grudge the child anything money could procure, she 
was not selfish in that respect, she was even sympathetic, 
but she could not instantly open her heart to love. In her 
soul she had blamed her son for this hardness, and she 
must struggle to overcome it. Simple duty was not all 
that was required ; there was a higher point. And how 
teach Robert to see it if she evaded it herself? 

" It is right and best that the child should be brought 
up among her relatives," she answered kindly. il I think 
we shall be able to manage. When will you be likely to 
return ? " glancing at Mr. Conover. 

" Oh, you will want to see the city before you leave it ! 
There is no hurry. We can come in and visit the little 
one again." 

He managed to coax a kiss out of her before he went 
away. 

. Then they started on their sad and distasteful errand. 
It was one of the poor creature's quiet days. She sat by 
a sunny window turning the leaves of a child's picture- 
book in gaudy colors. There was a lovely flush on her 
cheek, yet hardly the tint of health, and her vacant face 
had a curious, unearthly beauty. 

Mrs. Alston looked and turned away with a sigh. 

" Poor thing ! " said the nurse. " She gives very little 
trouble. My opinion is that she 's not so long for this 
world as they think, though some of them do live beyond 
everything ; but that 's more likely when they go insane 
naturally, without any accident, I mean. There's some- 
thing wrong with her spine, the doctors say. Mercy 
grant that she may not lie helpless years and years ! " 

They both echoed the prayer. Mrs. Alston turned 
away and her brother followed. 

" I think," she began, after they were in the carriage 
and driving slowly along, "that in some respects we can 
excuse Rob. He has always been hasty and impulsive. I 
can imagine the fascination this girl's beauty exercised 





over him, and no doubt she did lay a trap for him, if she 
fancied him the heir to a fortune. Evidently there was 
some object in marrying him ; it was not merely the love 
of flirtation. Still, it seems to me she might have done 
better, taken some one whose fortune was secure." 

" She had no doubt seen a good deal of the world, and 
on her part, I fancy, there was no very deep sentiment. 
But in the first place Robert should have kept away from 
such people. It serves to lower any young man's respect 
and regard for womanhood. He had been taught better, 
nay, he kmw better. Then, as Mrs. Fleming said, there is 
too much careless taking on of the most solemn vows of 
life. Marriage seems so easy, so delightful, that our 
young people take it up with about as much deliberation 
as going to an opera. They do not ask if it is the thing 
they want for thirty or fifty years, that they are not to 
thrust lightly aside, but endure with patience, realizing 
that it is an obligation of their own choosing, or their own 
haste and unwisdom. Then the ease with which these ties 
are sundered seems to offer a premium on thoughtlessness, 
and does weaken the sense of responsibility." 

" It is a bitter lesson. I fancy Robert will feel it more 
keenly as time goes on. But you thought he accepted it 
bravely," as if she could not bear to have him so 
severely blamed. 

" Yes, I think he displayed a great deal of courage and 
true manliness in his course, even to keeping the secret. 
He might have come to us then with his burden, and I 
shall always respect him that he bore it in silence as long 
as it was possible. The true test now is his living out of 
this, the kind of man he makes under this discipline. He 
has always been thoughtless as to consequences ; the pres- 
ent want has dominated him. He will have time now to 
ponder over the impatience of youth." 

" But, Robert, if she " 

" Hush, Dora, we must not allow ourselves to think of 




that," he answered solemnly. " With God alone belong 
the issues of life and death. It is the now that we are in, 
the present, and our work is to do the duty of the 
present." 

She did not make any immediate answer ; but after a 
considerable silence, said in a low, awed tone, " There 
Is one thing that I shall feel thankful for always, that she 
did not openly disgrace her child. A misfortune can be 
borne with dignity, but a scandal is never entirely over- 
lived." 

Robert Alston had saved his mother this bitter sorrow. 

They spent several pleasant days in going about the 
city that Mrs. Alston had not seen in years. Uncle 
Robert managed to make quite friends with Bertha, but 
at the last they took the little thing away in the evening, 
asleep, to spare the sad scene of a violent parting. Mrs. 
Fleming was deeply moved at separation from the little 
one who had become so like her very own. 

Their first day and evening were exceedingly trying. 
Bertha could be amused for a brief while ; then her sense 
of loss and strangeness would overwhelm her. Uncle 
Robert proved an admirable nurse, and before the jour- 
ney's end Mrs. Alston's heart had gone out to the little 
one, who displayed so many reminders of her father. She 
was large of her age and brimming with vitality, piquant 
rather than beautiful, and so little like her mother that it 
was a positive relief. 

They were watching for the travellers at Aunt Ruth's. 
Kathie saw the coach stop and ran down. 

" Oh ! " she cried with eager delight, l * is it really Rob's 
baby ? How pretty ! O mamma, how wonderfully like 
Rob ! Why, she hardly looks like a girl." 

Bertha was growing accustomed to strange faces. 
Something in Kathie's glad voice attracted her, and she 
stretched out her hands at once. 

" O you sweet little darling ! " 





" Republics are ungrateful," declared Uncle Robert, 
with an air of injured dignity. 

Kathie took her up to Aunt Ruth's room, and stood her 
on the floor while she was unfastening her cap and cloak. 
Bertha glanced around surprised, then startled, and 
stretched out her small hands with unforgotten longing. 

" I want my own mamma ! " in a pitiful, quivering tone 
that went to each heart. 

" O baby, we will all try to be your mamma." And she 
kissed her with tender fervor. 

Bertha leaned her head on Kathie's shoulder and gave a 
few sobs. They were fast friends then. 

It made a great diversion in the house, and baby soon 
settled to two prime favorites, Kathie and Uncle Robert. 
In a few days she recovered her wonted equilibrium, and 
proved herself a bright little mischief. Rob studied her 
with a curious feeling of awe, and secretly confessed to 
Kathie that he could not make her seem his, but he was 
deeply grateful to his mother for the love she gave her. 
In fact, the advent of the baby made Rob more of a hero 
than ever with the boys, He had a pathetic history, an 
unusual misfortune, and even at this early stage he felt his 
uncle's wisdom had proved invaluable.
