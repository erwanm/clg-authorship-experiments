help a few of them and I’m going to try.”

“May I humbly ask if these decayed gentlewomen are to inhabit their
palatial retreat rent-free?”

“That was my first plan, but Uncle showed me that it was wiser not
make genteel paupers of them, but let them pay a small rent and feel
independent. I don’t want the money, of course, and shall use it in
keeping the houses tidy or helping other women in like case,” said Rose,
entirely ignoring her cousin’s covert ridicule.

“Don’t expect any gratitude, for you won’t get it; nor much comfort with
a lot of forlornities on your hands, and be sure that when it is too
late you will tire of it all and wish you had done as other people do.”

“Thanks for your cheerful prophecies, but I think I’ll venture.”

She looked so undaunted that Charlie was a little nettled and fired his
last shot rather recklessly: “Well, one thing I do know you’ll never get
a husband if you go on in this absurd way, and by Jove! you need one to
take care of you and keep the property together!”

Rose had a temper, but seldom let it get the better of her; now,
however, it flashed up for a moment. Those last words were peculiarly
unfortunate, because Aunt Clara had used them more than once when
warning her against impecunious suitors and generous projects. She was
disappointed in her cousin, annoyed at having her little plans laughed
at, and indignant with him for his final suggestion.

“I’ll never have one, if I must give up the liberty of doing what I know
is right, and I’d rather go into the poorhouse tomorrow than ‘keep the
property together’ in the selfish way you mean!”

That was all but Charlie saw that he had gone too far and hastened to
make his peace with the skill of a lover, for, turning to the little
cabinet piano behind him, he sang in his best style the sweet old song:

    “Oh were thou in the cauld blast,”

dwelling with great effect, not only upon the tender assurance that “My
plaid should shelter thee,”

but also that, even if a king,

    “The brightest jewel in my crown
    Wad be my queen, wad be my queen.”

It was very evident that Prince Charming had not gone troubadouring
in vain, for Orpheus himself could not have restored harmony more
successfully. The tuneful apology was accepted with a forgiving smile
and a frank “I’m sorry I was cross, but you haven’t forgotten how to
tease, and I’m rather out of sorts today. Late hours don’t agree with
me.”

“Then you won’t feel like going to Mrs. Hope’s tomorrow, I’m afraid,”
 and Charlie took up the last note with an expression of regret which was
very flattering.

“I must go, because it is made for me, but I can come away early and
make up lost sleep. I do hate to be so fractious,” and Rose rubbed the
forehead that ached with too much racketing.

“But the German does not begin till late I’m to lead and depend upon
you. Just stay this once to oblige me,” pleaded Charlie, for he had set
his heart on distinguishing himself.

“No I promised Uncle to be temperate in my pleasures and I must keep my
word. I’m so well now, it would be very foolish to get ill and make him
anxious not to mention losing my beauty, as you are good enough to call
it, for that depends on health, you know.”

“But the fun doesn’t begin till after supper. Everything will be
delightful, I assure you, and we’ll have a gay old time as we did last
week at Emma’s.”

“Then I certainly will not, for I’m ashamed of myself when I remember
what a romp that was and how sober Uncle looked as he let me in at three
in the morning, all fagged out my dress in rags, my head aching, my feet
so tired that I could hardly stand, and nothing to show for five
hours’ hard work but a pocketful of bonbons, artificial flowers, and
tissue-paper fool’s caps. Uncle said I’d better put one on and go to
bed, for I looked as though I’d been to a French bal masque. I never
want to hear him say so again, and I’ll never let dawn catch me out in
such a plight anymore.”

“You were all right enough, for mother didn’t object and I got you
both home before daylight. Uncle is notional about such things, so I
shouldn’t mind, for we had a jolly time and we were none the worse for
it.”

“Indeed we were, every one of us! Aunt Clara hasn’t gotten over her cold
yet. I slept all the next day, and you looked like a ghost, for you’d
been out every night for weeks, I think.”

“Oh, nonsense! Everyone does it during the season, and you’ll get used
to the pace very soon,” began Charlie, bent on making her go, for he
was in his element in a ballroom and never happier than when he had his
pretty cousin on his arm.

“Ah! But I don’t want to get used to it, for it costs too much in the
end. I don’t wish to get used to being whisked about a hot room by men
who have taken too much wine, to turn day into night, wasting time that
might be better spent, and grow into a fashionable fast girl who can’t
get along without excitement. I don’t deny that much of it is pleasant,
but don’t try to make me too fond of gaiety. Help me to resist what I
know is hurtful, and please don’t laugh me out of the good habits Uncle
has tried so hard to give me.”

Rose was quite sincere in her appeal, and Charlie knew she was right,
but he always found it hard to give up anything he had set his heart on,
no matter how trivial, for the maternal indulgence which had harmed the
boy had fostered the habit of self-indulgence, which was ruining the
man. So when Rose looked up at him, with a very honest desire to save
him as well as herself from being swept into the giddy vortex which
keeps so many young people revolving aimlessly, till they go down or
are cast upon the shore, wrecks of what they might have been, he gave a
shrug and answered briefly: “As you please. I’ll bring you home as early
as you like, and Effie Waring shall take your place in the German. What
flowers shall I send you?”

Now, that was an artful speech of Charlie’s, for Miss Waring was a fast
and fashionable damsel who openly admired Prince Charming and had given
him the name. Rose disliked her and was sure her influence was bad, for
youth made frivolity forgivable, wit hid want of refinement, and beauty
always covers a multitude of sins in a man’s eyes. At the sound of
Effie’s name, Rose wavered, and would have yielded but for the memory
of the “first mate’s” last words. She did desire to “keep a straight
course”; so, though the current of impulse set strongly in a southerly
direction, principle, the only compass worth having, pointed due north,
and she tried to obey it like a wise young navigator, saying steadily,
while she directed to Annabel the parcel containing a capacious pair of
slippers intended for Uncle Mac: “Don’t trouble yourself about me. I can
go with Uncle and slip away without disturbing anybody.”

“I don’t believe you’ll have the heart to do it,” said Charlie
incredulously as he sealed the last note.

“Wait and see.”

“I will, but I shall hope to the last.” And kissing his hand to her, he
departed to post her letters, quite sure that Miss Waring would not lead
the German.

It certainly looked for a moment as if Miss Campbell would, because she
ran to the door with the words “I’ll go” upon her lips. But she did not
open it till she had stood a minute staring hard at the old glove on
Psyche’s head; then like one who had suddenly gotten a bright idea, she
gave a decided nod and walked slowly out of the room.




Chapter 6 POLISHING MAC

“Please could I say one word?” was the question three times repeated
before a rough head bobbed out from the grotto of books in which Mac
usually sat when he studied.

“Did anyone speak?” he asked, blinking in the flood of sunshine that
entered with Rose.

“Only three times, thank you. Don’t disturb yourself, I beg, for I
merely want to say a word,” answered Rose as she prevented him from
offering the easy chair in which he sat.

“I was rather deep in a compound fracture and didn’t hear. What can I do
for you, Cousin?” And Mac shoved a stack of pamphlets off the chair near
him with a hospitable wave of the hand that sent his papers flying in
all directions.

Rose sat down, but did not seem to find her “word” an easy one to
utter, for she twisted her handkerchief about her fingers in embarrassed
silence till Mac put on his glasses and, after a keen look, asked
soberly: “Is it a splinter, a cut, or a whitlow, ma’am?”

“It is neither. Do forget your tiresome surgery for a minute and be the
kindest cousin that ever was,” answered Rose, beginning rather sharply
and ending with her most engaging smile.

“Can’t promise in the dark,” said the wary youth.

“It is a favor, a great favor, and one I don’t choose to ask any of the
other boys,” answered the artful damsel.

Mac looked pleased and leaned forward, saying more affably, “Name it,
and be sure I’ll grant it if I can.”

“Go with me to Mrs. Hope’s party tomorrow night.”

“What!” And Mac recoiled as if she had put a pistol to his head.

“I’ve left you in peace a long time, but it is your turn now, so do your
duty like a man and a cousin.”

“But I never go to parties!” cried the unhappy victim in great dismay.

“High time you began, sir.”

“But I don’t dance fit to be seen.”
