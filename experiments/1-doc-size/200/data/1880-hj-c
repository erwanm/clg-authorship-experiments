" I am not a professional model," said the young 
lady. K. 

" No, That 's my difficulty," Longueville answered, 
laughing. " I can't propose to remunerate you." 

The young lady seemed to think this joke in indifferent taste. She turned away in silence; but 
something in her expression, in his feeling at the 
time, in the situation, incited Longueville to higher 
play. He felt a lively need of carrying his point. 

" You see it will be pure kindness," he went on, — 
"a simple act of charity. Five minutes will be 
enough. Treat me as an Italian beggar." 

She had laid down his sketch and had stepped forward. He stood there, obsequious, -clasping his hands 
and smiling. 

His interruptress stopped and looked at him again, 
as if she thought him a very odd person ; but she 
seemed amused. Now, at any rate, she was not 
frightened. She seemed even disposed to provoke 
him a little. 

" I wish to go to my mother," she said. 

" "Where is your mother ? " the young man asked. 

" In the church, of course. I didn' t come here 
alone ! " 

"Of course not; but you may be sure that your 
mother is very contented. I have been in that little 
church. It is charming. She is just resting there ; 
she is probably tired. If you will kindly give me 
five minutes more, she will come out to you." 

" Five minutes ? " the young girl asked. 

" Five minutes will do. I shall be eternally'rateful." Longueville was amused at himself as he said 
this. He cared infinitely less for his sketch than the 
words appeared to imply ; but, somehow, he cared 
greatly that this graceful stranger should do what he 
had proposed. 

The graceful stranger dropped an eye on the sketch 
again. 

" Is your picture so good as that ? " she asked. 

" I have a great deal of talent," he answered, laughing. 
" You shall see for yourself, when it is finished." 





She turned slowly toward the terrace again. 

" You certainly have a great deal of talent, to induce me to do what you ask." And she walked 
to where she had stood before. Longueville made a 
movement to go with her, as if to show her the attitude he meant ; but, pointing with decision to his 
easel, she said — 

"You have only five minutes." He immediately 
went back to his work, and she made a vague attempt to take up her position. " You must tell me 
if this will do," she added, in a moment. 

" It will do beautifully," Longueville answered, in 
a happy tone, looking at her and plying his brush. 
"It is immensely good of you to take so much 
trouble." 

For a moment she made no rejoinder, but presently 
she said — 

" Of course if I pose at all I wish to pose well." 

" You pose admirably,'' said Longueville. 

After this she said nothing, and for several minutes 
he painted rapidly and in silence. He felt a certain 
excitement, and the movement of his thoughts kept 
pace with that of his brush. It was very true that 
she posed admirably; she was a fine creature to 
paint. Her prettiness inspired him, and also her 
audacity, as he was content to regard it for the moment. He wondered about her — who she was, and 
what she was — perceiving that the so-called audacity was not vulgar boldness, but the play of an 
original and probably interesting character. It was 
obvious that she was a perfect lady, but it was 
equally obvious that she was irregularly clever. 
Longueville's little figure was a success — a charming success, he thought, as he put on the last touches. 
While he was doing this, his model's companion 
came into view. She came out of the church, pausing a moment as she looked from her daughter to the 
young man in the corner of the terrace; then she 
walked straight over to the young girl. She was a 
delicate little gentlewoman, with a light, quick step. 

Longueville's five minutes were up ; so, leaving 
his place, he approached the two ladies, sketch in 
hand. The elder one, who had passed her hand into 
her daughter's arm, looked up at him with clear, 
surprised eyes ; she was a charming old woman. 
Her eyes were very pretty, and on either side of 
them, above a pair of fine dark brows, was a band of 
silvery hair, rather coquettishly arranged. 

" It is my portrait," said her daughter, as Longue- 
ville drew near. " This gentleman has been sketch- 
ing me." 

" Sketching you, dearest ? " murmured her mother. 
" Wasn 't it rather sudden ? " 

"Very sudden — very abrupt!" exclaimed the 
young girl with a laugh. 

" Considering all that, it 's very good," said Longue- 





ville, offering his picture to the elder lady, who took 
it and began to examine it. " I can't tell you how 
much I thank you," he said to his model. 

" It 's very well for you to thank me now," she replied. " You really had no right to begin." 

" The temptation was so great." 

"We should resist temptation. And you should 
have asked my leave." 

" I was afraid you would refuse it ; and you stood 
there, just in my line of vision." 

" You should have asked me to get out of it." 

" I should have been very sorry. Besides, it would 
have been extremely rude." 

The young girl looked at him a moment. 

"Yes, I think it would. But what you have done 
is ruder." 

" It is a hard case ! " said Longueville. " What 
cojild I have done, then, decently ? " 

"It's a beautiful drawing," murmured the elder 
lady, handing the thing back to Longueville. Her 
daughter, meanwhile, had not even glanced at it. 

"You might have waited till I should go away," 
this argumentative young person continued. 

Longueville shook his head. 

" I never lose opportunities ! " 

"You might have sketched me afterwards, from 
memory." 

Longueville looked at her, smiling. 


"Judge how much better my memory will be 
now ! " 

She also smiled a little, but instantly became 
serious. 

" For myself, it 's an episode I shall try to forget. 
I don't like the part I have played in it." 

" May you never play a less becoming one ! " cried 
Longueville. " I hope that your mother, at least, will 
accept a memento of the occasion." And he turned 
again with his sketch to her companion, who had 
been listening to the girl's conversation with this en- 
terprising stranger, and looking from one to the other 
with an air of earnest confusion. " Won't you do me 
the honor of keeping my sketch ? " he said. " I 
think it really looks like your daughter." 

" Oh, thank you, thank you ; I hardly dare," mur- 
mured the lady, with a deprecating gesture. 

" It will serve as a kind of amends for the liberty 
I have taken," Longueville added ; and he began to 
remove the drawing from its paper block. 

" It makes it worse for you to give it to us," said 
the young girl. 

" Oh, my dear, I am sure it 's lovely ! " exclaimed 
her mother. " It 's wonderfully like you." 

" I think that also makes it worse ! "
