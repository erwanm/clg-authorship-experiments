Adam had always treated her in a half insolent way 



 

as if she were inferior and of little account ; and usually 
took pains to give things a direction, if possible, adverse 
to her wishes. This he was able to do, in consequence 
of his position as purse-bearer and account-keeper for 
the family. From this position, Mrs. Harte meant to 
have him removed ; but, she was in no haste. First of 
all, she must be well seated. There must be no doubt 
as to her influence over Mr. Guy. 

" How much do you ffive Adam for housekeeping 
purposes?" She put the question one evening when 
they sat alone together. Mr. Guy had no intimate 
acquaintances, and so went out in the evening but rarely. 
Mrs. Harte had him, therefore, so much in her power ; 
and in the most unobtrusive and unapparent way, 
managed to interest some of the lonely hours he spent 
at home. 

" Twenty dollars a week," answered Mr. Guy. 

Mrs, Harte looked down at the work in her hands, 
and remained silent. 

" Why do you ask ? " After a pause of nearly a 
minute, Mr. Guy put this question. He had been 
waiting all that time for the housekeeper ; but she did 
not seem inclined to any further remark. 

" Adam manages things very well for a boy better, 
probably, than one boy in a dozen could manage. Still, 
he is only a boy, and cannot be expected to understand 
the requirements of a household like this. Twenty 
dollars a week, if spent with judgment, should go farther 
than he makes it go." 

Mr. Guy did not answer. He felt a shade of per 
plexity coming over his mind. 



 

" It is nothing to me, of course," resumed Mrs. Harte. 
" I only express a passing thought. Another thino- I 
have observed is this. The position occupied hy Adam, 
puts him in a kind of forced antagonism towards the 
other children. Between him and John there is a con 
stant feud, growing mainly out of the fact that Adam's 
will regulates much in the family. He markets to suit 
his own tastes and whims ; and, I observe, takes pains to 
omit buying the very articles for which John and Lydia 
manifest a preference. If it goes on, a permanent 
alienation between him and the other children, as they 
grow up, will assuredly take place ; and, of all things, 
this should be guarded against as the worst of evils." 

" Is that so ? Does Adam really annoy his brothers 
and sisters in the way you intimate ? " said Mr. Guy. 

" Have they never complained ? " asked Mrs. Harte. 

" O yes. They're always complaining. But I'm 
used to that, and pay little heed to what they say." 

" They have cause." The housekeeper's voice had g, 
shade more of feeling. After a moment she added, 

'' One child in a family should not have as much 
power over the other children as Adam now possesses. 
He does not know how to rule wisely ; and they live 
daily in a state of half angry rebellion against him. 
Besides, sir, the boy's mind should be educated towards 
a man's duties in life, and not towards a woman's. 
You design him for regular business for a merchant, 
like yourself not a boarding-house keeper. His pres 
ent office at home is not, therefore, good for him. It 
will belittle his mind narrow it down to the smallest 
things incapacitate him for the larger sphere in which 


you look to see him move. But, excuse me, sir, for 
this freedom of speech. I have been led to say more 
than I intended." 

" There is reason in what you urge," returned Mr. 
Guy, " and I must think it over. Adam is a little in 
clined to be overbearing, I know ; but, as affairs have 
been, I could do no better than place things in his 
hands ; and, all circumstances considered, it seems to 
me that he has managed admirably. Not one boy in 
ten would have done so well," 

" Probably not one in a hundred," answered Mrs. 
Harte. 

And there the conversation dropped. But Mr. Guy 
understood his housekeeper. She was not satisfied to 
remain any longer subject to the will and direction of 
a boy. He must pass out of her way. 

Mr. Guy did not act immediately on the suggestion 
of Mrs. Harte. Too much was involved in this. It 
included the fact of a new disbursing agent in the 
household, and that agent the lady herself. Would it 
be wise to admit her to this place of power ? Over, 
and over, and over again the question was revolved, and 
yet without decision. In the meantime, Mrs. Harte, 
from behind the screen of an unimpassioned exterior, 
watched, eagle-eyed, the progress of things, drawing all 
the \yhile a little and a little more firmly on the reins 
of government that were in her hands. 

" Adam," said she, one morning, as the boy passed 
her in the hall, She knew that it was market day. 

He stopped, turning his head partly towards her, with 
an air of indifference. 



 

" Are you going to market ? " 

" Yes." 

" I wish you would get a pair of chickens for to-day's 
dinner." 

"I shall get corned beef;" was almost insolently 
answered. 

" Oh, very well." And Mrs. Harte turned from 
him in her calm, quiet way. An observer would have 
detected no indication of a quicker heart-throb. 

At dinner time, Mrs. Harte said, speaking across the 
table to Mr. Guy 

" I asked Adam to get a pair of chickens for dinner 
to-day." Her tones were cold and even. 

Mr. Guy turned his eyes on Adam, whose face col 
ored a little. 

" Why didn't you do as Mrs. Harte desired ? " The 
boy was not prepared for the sternness with which this 
question was asked, and stammered out an unsatisfacto 
ry reply. 

" Don't let it occur again." Mr. Guy spoke in ear 
nest. 

No more was said at the time ; but the spirit destined 
to rule in that house had gained a victory, and soon 
every inmate had an impression of the fact. It took 
only a week or two from this time for Mrs. Harte to 
bring Adam to the position of a mere agent of her will 
in the household administration. He bought as she 
gave direction, being little more than purse-bearer. 
There were no contentions between him and Mrs. Harte. 
If he rebelled, and was insolent, she did not stoop to 
his level, but, with subtle management, turned his fa- 



 

ther's iron hand upon him. In six months after the 
death of Mrs. Guy, the housekeeper's will was supreme 
in the family where wife and mother had been thrust 
aside, and held as of no account. 




CHAPTER XXIV. 



RS. Harte was a woman of superior 
mind, and some cultivation. Her 
husband, a lawyer of considerable 
promise, died just as he was rising 
to an eminent position at the bar, 
and she was left without an income. 
In order to sustain herself, she 
taught for a few years ; but not find 
ing, in this occupation, anything 
congenial, she gave up her scholars, and accepted the 
place of housekeeper in Mr. Guy's family. Her position 
there proved very far from being agreeable, and she was 
simply waiting for an opportunity to change, when the
