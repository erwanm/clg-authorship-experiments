" I wanted it " Matilda answered. 

What for ? " 

" I wanted it to give away," Matilda said 
in a low voice, being obliged to speak. 

Mrs. Candy waited till they were out of 
the shop, and then desired to know particulars. For whom Matilda wanted it; where 
she took it ; when she went ; who went with 
her. 

" Is it a clean place ? " was her inquiry at 
last. Matilda was obliged to confess it was 
not. 



 

" Don't go there again without my knowledge, Matilda. Do you hear?" 

" I hear. But aunt Candy," said Matilda 
in great dismay, " it doesn't hurt me." 

" No. I mean it shall not. Have you 
always gone wandering just where you 
liked ? " 

" Yes, always. Shadywalk is a perfectly 
safe place." 

" For common children perhaps. Not for 
you. Do not go near Lilac lane again. It 
is a mercy you have escaped safe as it is." 

Escaped from what, Matilda wondered? 
Even a little soil to her clothes might be 
washed off; and she did not think she had 
got so much harm as that. If she could 
only meet Norton, now, before reaching 
home ! there would never be another chance. 
Matilda longed to see him, with an intensity 
which seemed almost as if it must bring him 
before her; but it did not. In vain she 
watched every corner and every group of 
boys or cluster of people they passed ; Norton's trim figure was not to be seen ; and the 
house door shut upon Matilda in her despair. 
She went up to her room, and kneeling down 
laid her head on the table. 

" It's almost tea-time," said Maria. " What 
is the matter now ? " 

But Matilda was not crying; she was in 
despair. 

" Come ! " said Maria. " Come, what ails 
you ? Tired ? It is time to get tea, Matilda, 
and I want your help. What is the matter 
now ? " 

Matilda lifted a perfectly forlorn face to her 
sister. 

" I can't go anywhere ! " she said. " I am 
in prison. I can't go to Lilac lane any more. 
I cannot do anything any more. And they 
want me so ! " 

Down went Matilda's head. Maria stood, 
perhaps a little conscience struck. 

" Who wants you so much ? " 

" The poor people there. Mrs. Eldridge 
and Mrs. Rogers. They want me so much." 



 

"What for, Tilly?" said Maria, a little 
more gently than her wont. 

" O for a great many things," said Matilda, 
brushing away a tear or two ; " and now I 
can go no more I cannot do anything O 
dear ! " 

The little girl broke down. 

" She's the most hateful, spiteful, masterful 
woman, that ever was ! " Maria exclaimed ; 
" too mean to live, and too cunning to breathe. 
She's an old witch ! " 

O don't, Maria ! " 

" I will," said Maria. " I will talk. It is 
the only comfort I have. What is she up to 
now ? " 

" Just that," said Matilda. " She found I 
had been to Lilac lane, and she said I must 
not go again without her knowing ; and she 
will never let me go. I needn't ask her. She 
doesn't like me to go there. And I wanted 
to do so much! If she could only have 
waited only have waited " 

" What made you let her know you had 
been there ? " 




" She found out. I couldn't help it. Now 
she will not let me go ever again. Never, 
never ! " 

" What did you want to do in Lilac lane, 
Tilly?" 

" O, things. I wanted to do a great deal. 
Things. They'll never be done!" cried 
Matilda in bitter distress. " I cannot do 
them now. I cannot do anything." 

" She is as mean as she can live ! " said 
Maria again. " But Tilly, I don't believe 
Lilac lane is a good place for you, neither. 
What did you want to do there? what 
could you do ? " 

" Things " said Matilda, indefinitely. 

" You are not old enough to go poking 
about Lilac lane by yourself." 

" I can't go any way," said Matilda. 

She cried a long while to wash down this 
disappointment; and the effects of it did not 
go off in the tears. The child became very 
silent and sober. Her duties she did, as she 
had done them, about the house and in Mrs. 




 

Candy's room ; but the bright face and the 
glad ways were gone. In the secret of her 
private hours Matilda had struggles to go 
through that left her with the marks of care 
upon her all the rest of the time. 

The next Sunday she was made to go to 
church with her aunt. She went to her own 
Sunday school in the afternoon ; but she was 
not allowed to get off early enough for the 
reading and talk with Mary and Ailie. Lem 
Dow however was on hand ; that was one 
single drop of comfort. He looked for his 
sugared almonds, and they were on hand too ; 
and besides that, Matilda was able to see that 
he was quite pleased with the place and the 
singing and the doings in his class, and making friends with the boys. 

" Will you come next Sunday ? " Matilda 
asked him as they were going out. He 
nodded. 

" Won't Jemima come too, if you ask her ? " 

" I won't ask her." 

" No ? why not ? " 



 

" I don't want her to come." 

" You don't want her to come ? Why it 
is a pleasant place, isn't it? " 

" It's a heap more jolly if she ain't here," 
said Lem knowingly. 

It was a difficult argument to answer, with 
one whose general benevolence was not very 
full grown yet. Matilda went home thinking 
how many people wanted something done 
for them, and how she could touch nobody. 
She was not allowed to go to church in the 
evening.
