Ben walked aft into the saloon, followed by his 
companions. Ethan was sitting in a chair by the 
side of the state-room door. The fireman passed 
round behind, and suddenly fell upon him, throwing 
him on the floor, and pinioning his arms to his back. 

" What are you about ? " cried Ethan, struggling 
to release himself. " Help ! help ! " 







" Stop his mouth ! " said Ben, fearfully. 

Vainly poor Ethan endeavored to shake off his 
assailants ; his arms were tied together hehind him, 
and a handkerchief stuffed into his mouth. In this 
condition he was lashed to a stanchion, so that he 
could move neither hand nor foot. 

The commotion of this outrage attracted the atten- 
tion of Mrs. Light and the two waiter-girls, who were 
employed in the lower cabin. The fireman exhibited 
a pistol to them, drove them below again, and threat- 
ened to shoot them if they made any noise. A 
similar demonstration quieted the fireman, and com- 
pelled him to return to the fire-room. 

" The job is done," said Baker, the leader of the 
enterprise. 

" But we haven't got the money," added Flint, 
the deck hand. 

" We don't want that yet. It is safe where it is. 
Now both of you to your stations," continued Baker ; 
and he went down into the fire-room. 

Ben's station was in the wheel-house, Flint's at the 
fasts, and Baker's at the engine, as it appeared from 
their subsequent movements ; and it was evident, from 



 

the operations in progress, that the villains intended 
to make their escape in the steamer. Baker stopped 
the hissing steam which was going to waste, and 
compelled the fireman to renew the fires. 

" Be lively ! " shouted Ben, from the wheel-house, 
as he discovered Lawry on the shore, hastening back 
to the steamer with his bundle of clothes. 

" All ready ! " replied Baker, finding there was 
steam enough to start the boat. 

Flint had already cast ofi" the fasts, without waiting 
for orders, and was standing on the forecastle, as 
impatient to be off as a man can be who is engaged 
in the commission of a crime. 

Ben rang the bell to back her ; the wheels turned, 
but as the stern line had been cast ofi", her bow was 
not carried out from the wharf. By this time Lawry 
had discovered that the Woodville was in motion. 
He was astonished and alarmed, though he was far 
from surmising that his boat had been captured by 
robbers. Running with all his speed, he reached the 
head of the vharf just as the boat had backed far 
enough to permit Ben to see him, and for him 
to see that Ben was at the wheel. Then he 







realized that his brother was engaged in another 
conspiracy. 

Notwithstanding his extensive knowledge of 
" steamboating " in general, Ben Wilford was a 
very unskilful pilot. If he had understood the man- 
agement of a boat half as well as Lawry, the nefa- 
rious scheme might have been successful. He saw 
his brother ; he did not wish to have him come on 
board, for Lawry might be so obstinate as to induce 
one of his dissolute companions to fire at him. He 
rang the bell to stop her, and then to go ahead, at 
the same time putting the helm hard a-port. 

The Woodville went forward, and as she met the 
helm her bow came round, and she was headed out 
into the middle of the lake. As she went ahead, 
her stern swept in a circle within a few feet of the 
wharf, just as Lawry, breathless with haste and alarm, 
reached the end of the pier. The little captain knew 
nothing of the state of things on board, except that 
his brother Ben was at the wheel, which, however, 
was a sufficient explanation to him. The Woodville 
was going, and he could not let her depart without 
him. Dropping his bundle, he leaped to the plank- 



 

shear, grasping the rail with both hands. Jumping 
over the bulwark, he stood on the guard from which 
opened the windows of the saloon. 

Neither of the three conspirators were in a sit- 
uation to see this movement on the part of Lawry. 
Ben was too much occupied in steering — for he was 
not a little fearful of getting aground in some shoal 
water between the ferry and the wharf — to notice 
anything ; but as soon as he had obtained his course, 
he looked for his brother on the pier. He was not 
there ; but Ben did not suspect that he was on 
board the Woodville. Baker, who knew just enough 
about an engine to stop and start it, was working 
the valves with the bar ; and he could think of 
nothing else. Doubtless he was conscious by this 
time that he had " taken a big job," in assuming 
the control of the engine. 

Lawry was bewildered by the situation. When 
his feet struck the deck, his first impulse was to 
rush up to the wheel-house, and confront the diffi- 
culty as the case might require. He started to carry 
out his purpose, when he happened to look through 
one of the saloon windows, and discovered Ethan, 



 



with the handkerchief in his mouth, tied to the 
stanchion. Deeply as he sympathized with his friend 
in his unpleasant position, he was still cheered by 
the sight, for it assured him that the engineer had 
been faithful to his duties, and was not a party to 
the conspiracy. 

The little captain went round and entered the 
saloon by the door, without being seen by either 
of the conspirators. He removed the gag from 
Ethan's mouth, and proceeded to unfasten the cords 
with which he was bound. 

" What does all this mean, Ethan ? " demanded 
Lawry, in excited tones, and almost crying with 
vexation. 

" Hush ! Do they know you are here ? " asked 
the engineer. 

" I think not ; I don't know." 

" Keep still, then. They are after the gold." 

" Who are they ? " 

" Ben and two other fellows. I don't know 
them." 

" We'll stop this thing very quick," said Lawry, 
in hurried tones. 



 

" They are armed with pistols, and threatened to 
shoot all hands. Be careful, Lawry, or you will 
get a bullet through your head." 

" What shall we do ? " demanded the young pilot, 
who had no desire to be shot. 

Ethan was an accomplished strategist ; he had 
fought the Indians both with his wits and his weap- 
ons, and he promptly undertook the management 
of the affair. He led the way to the lower cabin, 
where the terrified women had been driven by 
the ruffians. Mrs. Light declared she was fright- 
ened out of her senses, and she " never did hear 
of such goings on." 

" If any of those men ask for me, tell them I 
got loose, jumped overboard, and swam ashore,"
