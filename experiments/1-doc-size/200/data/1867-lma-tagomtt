money and letter informing him that Peggy had spent her first two nights
preparing for flight, and on the third had gone away to marry and sail
with Jack. The noises had been produced by the artist, who was a
ventriloquist, the skeleton had been smuggled from the surgeons, and the
whole thing was a conspiracy to help Peggy and accommodate the
fishermen.”

“It is evident that roguery is hereditary,” laughed Rose as the
narrator paused.

“I strongly suspect that Sir Jasper the second was the true hero of that
story,” added Mrs. Snowdon.

“Think what you like, I’ve done my part, and leave the stage for
you, madam.”

“I will come last. It is your turn, dear.” As Mrs. Snowdon softly
uttered the last word, and Octavia leaned upon her knee with an
affectionate glance, Treherne leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the
two changed faces, and looked as if bewildered when both smiled at him,
as they sat hand in hand while the girl told her story.

“Long ago a famous actress suddenly dropped dead at the close of a
splendidly played tragedy. She was carried home, and preparations were
made to bury her. The play had been gotten up with great care and
expense, and a fine actor was the hero. The public demanded a
repetition, and an inferior person was engaged to take the dead lady’s
part. A day’s delay had been necessary, but when the night came the
house was crowded. They waited both before and behind the curtain for
the debut of the new actress, with much curiosity. She stood waiting for
her cue, but as it was given, to the amazement of all, the great
tragedienne glided upon the stage. Pale as marble, and with a strange
fire in her eyes, strange pathos in her voice, strange power in her
acting, she went through her part, and at the close vanished as
mysteriously as she came. Great was the excitement that night, and
intense the astonishment and horror next day when it was whispered
abroad that the dead woman never had revived, but had lain in her coffin
before the eyes of watchers all the evening, when hundreds fancied they
were applauding her at the theater. The mystery never was cleared up,
and Paris was divided by two opinions: one that some person marvelously
like Madame Z. had personated her for the sake of a sensation; the other
that the ghost of the dead actress, unable to free itself from the old
duties so full of fascination to an ambitious and successful woman, had
played for the last time the part which had made her famous.”

“Where did you find that, Tavie? It’s very French, and not bad if you
invented it,” said Sir Jasper.

“I read it in an old book, where it was much better told. Now, Edith,
there is just time for your tale.”

As the word “Edith” passed her lips, again Treherne started and eyed
them both, and again they smiled, as Mrs. Snowdon caressed the
smooth cheek leaning on her knee, and looking full at him began the
last recital.

“You have been recounting the pranks of imaginary ghosts; let me show
you the workings of some real spirits, evil and good, that haunt every
heart and home, making its misery or joy. At Christmastime, in a country
house, a party of friends met to keep the holidays, and very happily
they might have done so had not one person marred the peace of several.
Love, jealousy, deceit, and nobleness were the spirits that played their
freaks with these people. The person of whom I speak was more haunted
than the rest, and much tormented, being willful, proud, and jealous.
Heaven help her, she had had no one to exorcise these ghosts for her,
and they goaded her to do much harm. Among these friends there were more
than one pair of lovers, and much tangling of plots and plans, for
hearts are wayward and mysterious things, and cannot love as duty bids
or prudence counsels. This woman held the key to all the secrets of the
house, and, having a purpose to gain, she used her power selfishly, for
a time. To satisfy a doubt, she feigned a fancy for a gentleman who once
did her the honor of admiring her, and, to the great scandal of certain
sage persons, permitted him to show his regard for her, knowing that it
was but a transient amusement on his part as well as upon hers. In the
hands of this woman lay a secret which could make or mar the happiness
of the best and dearest of the party. The evil spirits which haunted her
urged her to mar their peace and gratify a sinful hope. On the other
side, honor, justice, and generosity prompted her to make them happy,
and while she wavered there came to her a sweet enchantress who, with a
word, banished the tormenting ghosts forever, and gave the haunted woman
a talisman to keep her free henceforth.”

There the earnest voice faltered, and with a sudden impulse Mrs. Snowdon
bent her head and kissed the fair forehead which had bent lower and
lower as she went on. Each listener understood the truth, lightly veiled
in that hasty fable, and each found in it a different meaning. Sir
Jasper frowned and bit his lips, Annon glanced anxiously from face to
face, Octavia hid hers, and Treherne’s flashed with sudden intelligence,
while Rose laughed low to herself, enjoying the scene. Blanche, who was
getting sleepy, said, with a stifled gape, “That is a very nice, moral
little story, but I wish there had been some real ghosts in it.”

“There was. Will you come and see them?”

As she put the question, Mrs. Snowdon rose abruptly, wishing to end the
séance, and beckoning them to follow glided up the great stairway. All
obeyed, wondering what whim possessed her, and quite ready for any jest
in store for them.




Chapter VIII


JASPER

She led them to the north gallery and, pausing at the door, said
merrily, “The ghost--or ghosts rather, for there were two--which
frightened Patty were Sir Jasper and myself, meeting to discuss certain
important matters which concerned Mr. Treherne. If you want to see
spirits we will play phantom for you, and convince you of our power.”

“Good, let us go and have a ghostly dance, as a proper finale of our
revel,” answered Rose as they flocked into the long hall.

At that moment the great clock struck twelve, and all paused to bid the
old year adieu. Sir Jasper was the first to speak, for, angry with Mrs.
Snowdon, yet thankful to her for making a jest to others of what had
been earnest to him, he desired to hide his chagrin under a gay manner;
and taking Rose around the waist was about to waltz away as she
proposed, saying cheerily, “‘Come one and all, and dance the new year
in,’” when a cry from Octavia arrested him, and turning he saw her
stand, pale and trembling, pointing to the far end of the hall.

Eight narrow Gothic windows pierced either wall of the north
gallery. A full moon sent her silvery light strongly in upon the
eastern side, making broad bars of brightness across the floor. No
fires burned there now, and wherever the moonlight did not fall deep
shadows lay. As Octavia cried out, all looked, and all distinctly
saw a tall, dark figure moving noiselessly across the second bar of
light far down the hall.

“Is it some jest of yours?” asked Sir Jasper of Mrs. Snowdon, as the
form vanished in the shadow.

“No, upon my honor, I know nothing of it! I only meant to relieve
Octavia’s superstitious fears by showing her our pranks” was the
whispered reply as Mrs. Snowdon’s cheek paled, and she drew nearer
to Jasper.

“Who is there?” called Treherne in a commanding tone.

No answer, but a faint, cold breath of air seemed to sigh along the
arched roof and die away as the dark figure crossed the third streak
of moonlight. A strange awe fell upon them all, and no one spoke, but
stood watching for the appearance of the shape. Nearer and nearer it
came, with soundless steps, and as it reached the sixth window its
outlines were distinctly visible. A tall, wasted figure, all in black,
with a rosary hanging from the girdle, and a dark beard half
concealing the face.

“The Abbot’s ghost, and very well got up,” said Annon, trying to laugh
but failing decidedly, for again the cold breath swept over them,
causing a general shudder.

“Hush!” whispered Treherne, drawing Octavia to his side with a
protecting gesture.

Once more the phantom appeared and disappeared, and as they waited for
it to cross the last bar of light that lay between it and them, Mrs.
Snowdon stepped forward to the edge of the shadow in which they stood,
as if to confront the apparition alone. Out of the darkness it came, and
in the full radiance of the light it paused. Mrs. Snowdon, being
nearest, saw the face first, and uttering a faint cry dropped down upon
the stone floor, covering up her eyes. Nothing human ever wore a look
like that of the ghastly, hollow-eyed, pale-lipped countenance below the
hood. All saw it and held their breath as it slowly raised a shadowy arm
and pointed a shriveled finger at Sir Jasper.

“Speak, whatever you are, or I’ll quickly prove whether you are man or
spirit!” cried Jasper fiercely, stepping forward as if to grasp the
extended arm that seemed to menace him alone.

An icy gust swept through the hall, and the phantom slowly receded into
the shadow. Jasper sprang after it, but nothing crossed the second
stream of light, and nothing remained in the shade. Like one possessed
by a sudden fancy he rushed down the gallery to find all fast and empty,
and to return looking very strangely. Blanche had fainted away and Annon
was bearing her out of the hall. Rose was clinging to Mrs. Snowdon, and
Octavia leaned against her cousin, saying in a fervent whisper, “Thank
God it did not point at you!”

“Am I then dearer than your brother?” he whispered back.

There was no audible reply, but one little hand involuntarily pressed
his, though the other was outstretched toward Jasper, who came up white
and startled but firm and quiet. Affecting to make light of it, he said,
forcing a smile as he raised Mrs. Snowdon, “It is some stupid joke of
the servants. Let us think no more of it. Come, Edith, this is not like
your usual self.”

“It was nothing human, Jasper; you know it as well as I. Oh, why did I
bring you here to meet the warning phantom that haunts your house!”

“Nay, if my time is near the spirit would have found me out wherever
I might be. I have no faith in that absurd superstition--I laugh at
and defy it. Come down and drink my health in wine from the Abbot’s
own cellar.”
