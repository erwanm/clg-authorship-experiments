By this time they were in the kitchen, and Mrs. Young went out to the
porch to receive and pay for the fish, her niece Ruth silently
following. Croom took off his old hat and made a backward scrape with
his foot by way of salutation; his small head was covered with a mat of
boyish-looking yellow curls, which contrasted strangely with his red
face.

"Here's yer fish," he said, holding them out toward Anne.

But she could not take them: she was gazing, fascinated, at his
hand--that broad short left hand which haunted her like a horrible
phantom day and night. She raised her handkerchief to her lips in order
to conceal, as far as possible, the horror she feared her face must
betray.

"You never could abide a fishy smell, Ruth," said Mrs. Young,
interposing. She paid the fisherman, and asked whether he fished in the
winter. He said "no," but gave no reason. He did not, as she had hoped,
pronounce the desired word. Then, after another gaze at Anne, he went
away, but turned twice to look back before he reached the end of the
garden.

"It can not be that he suspects!" murmured Anne.

"No; it's your face, child. Happy or unhappy, you can not help having
just the same eyes, hair, and skin, thank the Lord!"

They went upstairs and watched him from the window; he pushed off his
dug-out, got in, and paddled toward the village.

"More whiskey!" said Miss Lois, sitting down and rubbing her forehead.
"I wish, Ruth Young--I devoutly wish that I knew what it is best to do
now!"

"Then you think with me?" said Anne, eagerly.

"By no means. There isn't a particle of certainty. But--I don't deny
that there is a chance. The trouble is that we can hardly stir in the
matter without arousing his suspicion. If he had lived in the village
among other people, it would not have been difficult; but, all alone in
that far-off cabin--"

Anne clasped her hands suddenly. "Let us send for Père Michaux!" she
said. "There was a picture of the Madonna in his cabin--he is a Roman
Catholic. Let us send for Père Michaux."

They gazed at each other in excited silence. Miss Lois was the first to
speak. "I'm not at all sure but that you have got hold of the difficulty
by the right handle at last, Anne," she said, slowly, drawing a long
audible breath. It was the first time she had used the name since their
departure from New York.

And the letter was written immediately.

"It's a long journey for a small chance," said the elder woman,
surveying it as it lay sealed on the table. "Still, I think he will
come."

"Yes, for humanity's sake," replied Anne.

"I don't know about humanity," replied her companion, huskily; "but he
will come for yours. Let us get out in the open air; I'm perfectly
tired out by this everlasting whispering. It would be easier to roar."

The letter was sent. Four days for it to go, four days for the answer to
return, one day for chance. They agreed not to become impatient before
the tenth day.

But on the ninth came, not a letter, but something better--Père Michaux
in person.

They were in the fields at sunset, at some distance from the house, when
Anne's eyes rested upon him, walking along the country road in his old
robust fashion, on his way to the farm-house. She ran across the field
to the fence, calling his name. Miss Lois followed, but more slowly; her
mind was in a turmoil regarding his unexpected arrival, and the
difficulty of making him comprehend or conform to the net-work of fable
she had woven round their history.

The old priest gave Anne his blessing; he was much moved at seeing her
again. She held his hand in both of her own, and could scarcely realize
that it was he, her dear old island friend, standing there in person
beside her.

"Dear, dear Père Michaux, how good you are to come!" she said,
incoherently, the tears filling her eyes, half in sorrow, half in joy.

Miss Lois now came up and greeted him. "I am glad to see you," she said.
Then, in the same breath: "Our names, Father Michaux, are Young;
Young--please remember."

"How good you are to come!" said Anne again, the weight on her heart
lightened for the moment as she looked into the clear, kind, wise old
eyes that met her own.

"Not so very good," said Père Michaux, smiling. "I have been wishing to
see you for some time, and I think I should have taken the journey
before long in any case. Vacations are due me; it is years since I have
had one, and I am an old man now."

"You will never be old," said the girl, affectionately.

"Young is the name," repeated Miss Lois, with unconscious
appositeness--"Deborah and Ruth Young."

"I am glad at least that I am not too old to help you, my child,"
answered Père Michaux, paying little heed to the elder woman's anxious
voice.

They were still standing by the road-side. Père Michaux proposed that
they should remain in the open air while the beautiful hues of the
sunset lasted, and they therefore returned to the field, and sat down
under an elm-tree. Under ordinary circumstances, Miss Lois would have
strenuously objected to this sylvan indulgence, having peculiarly
combative feelings regarding dew; but this evening the maze of doubt in
which she was wandering as to whether or not Père Michaux would stay in
her web made dew a secondary consideration. Remaining in the fields
would at least give time.

Père Michaux was as clear-headed and energetic as ever. After the first
few expressions of gladness and satisfaction, it was not long before he
turned to Anne, and spoke of the subject which lay before them. "Tell me
all," he said. "This is as good a time and place as any we could have,
and there should be, I think, no delay."

But though he spoke to Anne, it was Miss Lois who answered: it would
have been simply impossible for her not to take that narrative into her
own hands.

He listened to the tale with careful attention, not interrupting her
many details with so much as a smile or a shrug. This was very unlike
his old way with Miss Lois, and showed more than anything else could
have done his absorbed interest in the story.

"It is the old truth," he said, after the long stream of words had
finally ceased. "Regarding the unravelling of mysteries, women seem
sometimes endowed with a sixth sense. A diamond is lost on a turnpike. A
man goes along the turnpike searching for it. A woman, searching for it
also, turns vaguely off into a field, giving no logical reason for her
course, and--finds it."

But while he talked, his mind was in reality dwelling upon the pale girl
beside him, the young girl in whom he had felt such strong interest, for
whom he had involuntarily cherished such high hope in those early days
on the island.

He knew of her testimony at the trial; he had not been surprised. What
he had prophesied for her had come indeed. But not so fortunately or so
happily as he had hoped. He had saved her from Erastus Pronando for
this! Was it well done? He roused himself at last, perceiving that Anne
was noticing his abstraction; her eyes were fixed upon him with anxious
expectation.

"I must go to work in my own way," he said, stroking her hair. "One
point, however, I have already decided: you must leave this
neighborhood immediately. I wish you had never come."

"But she can not be separated from me," said Miss Lois; "and of course
I shall be necessary in the search--I must be here."

"I do not see that there is any necessity at present," replied Père
Michaux. "You have done all you could, and I shall work better, I think,
alone." Then, as the old quick anger flashed from her eyes, he turned to
Anne. "It is on your account, child," he said. "I must make you go. I
know it is like taking your life from you to send you away now. But if
anything comes of this--if your woman's blind leap into the dark proves
to have been guided by intuition, the lime-light of publicity will
instantly be turned upon this neighborhood, and you could not escape
discovery. Your precautions, or rather those of our good friend Miss
Lois, have availed so far: you can still depart in their shadow
unobserved. Do so, then, while you can. My first wish is--can not help
being--that you should escape. I would rather even have the clew fail
than have your name further connected with the matter."

"This is what we get by applying to a man," said Miss Lois, in high
indignation. "Always thinking of evil!"

"Yes, men do think of it. But Anne will yield to my judgment, will she
not?"

"I will do as you think best," she answered. But no color rose in her
pale face, as he had expected; the pressing danger and the fear clothed
the subject with a shroud.

Miss Lois did not hide her anger and disappointment. Yet she would not
leave Anne. And therefore the next morning Mrs. Young and her niece,
with health much improved by their sojourn in the country, bade good-by
to their hostess, and went southward in the little stage on their way
back to "Washington."

Père Michaux was not seen at the farm-house at all; he had returned to
the village from the fields, and had taken rooms for a short sojourn at
the Timloe hotel.

The "Washington," in this instance, was a small town seventy miles
distant; here Mrs. Young and her niece took lodgings, and began, with
what patience they could muster, their hard task of waiting.

As for Père Michaux, he went fishing.
