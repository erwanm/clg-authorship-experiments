"Oh, with pleasure. I think I know your little 
gift-book all by heart," and she raised apprecia- 
tive eyes. She never knew how near she had 
come to losing it. 



CHAPTER XI 

A GIRL IN LOVE 

She found in the guest chamber a box of 
pansies in bloom. There was Daisy's room much 
more ornate than when she had last seen it, full 
of all manner of keepsakes and souvenirs. How 
strange it was to be here and not see Daisy. 
She would marry presently and go away, and 
Willard also. They would be left here alone, â€” 
oh, no, there would be grandchildren. If she 
had been horn in just such a home and with just 
such a mother! This mother would understand 
the many wants and mysteries that often crowded 
a girl's heart to pain. She had envied girls with 
charming mothers, she had played at daughter- 
hood, but to have it real and like this! And a 
father to take delight in one's girlish fancies! 

She uttered a very earnest prayer. It was 
full of thankfulness for all the good and blessed 
things that had come in her life and that God 
would keep her continually thankful. Then she 
put out the light and fell asleep. 
' Christmas morning was beautiful ; she was glad 
 



 

of that. They were to drive over to Woody 
Crest, five miles, and keep Christmas with the 
Reverend Lawrence Hollis, since he could not 
have his betrothed. It was one of the new rail- 
road stations on a sort of knoll with a slope of 
two miles or so down to the river. There were 
some beautiful residences shut up now for the 
winter, a cluster of smaller houses and country 
streets with well made side walks, then to the 
eastward farms and woodland. A pretty chapel 
had been erected in the summer, mostly a gift 
from a generous woman, and by spring there was 
to be a rectory and a bride. 

"Come and help me gather my Christmas offer- 
ing," Mrs. Bell said, leading the way to a room 
turned into a conservatory. "It is my diversion 
in the winter, for I do not care much for driving 
about in the cold." 

Helen drew a long breath. She wondered 
where the pansies had come from. There were 
brilliant geraniums in bloom, not a few lovely 
roses and clusters of white ageratum. The 
violets had been cut and bunched the day before, 
and now Mrs. Bell filled a great basket, fairly 
rifling the small place. 

Helen was in a maze of delight, and most en- 
thusiastic. 




"Now you must put on your wraps at once as 
we must get there before service, and when we 
come home we will talk flowers," she said. 

It was just delightfully cold, the girl in- 
sisted with glowing eyes and cheeks, and far 
down the valley a chime seemed to answer the 
soft bell on the hill. How beautiful it all was, 
and how it had changed since the summer she 
had driven about here. Afar off was the slow- 
tided river, looking blue in the reflection of the 
sky. Every branch and twig seemed to stand 
out with a tip of gold. 

There had been some flowers sent from the 
city and the small chapel was beautifully deco- 
rated with evergreens. Helen remembered that 
Willard had spoken of his friend Mr. Hollis, and 
suggested a possible lover for Marjorie. He had 
a fine face and figure, and a clear well-trained 
voice, and Helen was much moved by the impres- 
sive service and the ready responses. 

Afterward he came to speak to them. There 
was to be a Christmas tree for the children at 
three in the afternoon, and at four he was to 
take the train to Rutledge, some thirty miles be- 
low on the same road, to the Townes', where he 
was to enjoy a Christmas dinner with his be- 
trothed. 



 

The Bells were to have a noon dinner so that 
both servants could have the evening. 

"We have not been alone for years on this 
day," Mr. Bell said. "So, Helen, we are doubly 
glad to have you. This wonderful wedding was 
appointed first for New Year's eve, but for some 
reason the bridal party wanted to sail on Satur- 
day, so it was hurried up a little. And Apnis 
pleaded to have Marjorie stay with her. But we 
will keep the feast all the same." 

It seemed to Helen that she was the entertainer. 
They wanted to hear about her father and how 
near she had come to being spirited away, and 
many things that could not have been explained 
in letters. And she heard about their meeting 
the Duer party at Montreal and traveling with 
them for a fortnight and Miss Duer and her 
brother visiting them in the early fall. Mrs. 
Newell was an older married sister, and there 
was one in San Francisco where Dr. Duer, the 
father, had made his fortune and died. 

It was not until the next day that Helen learned 
the little dissatisfaction that had grown out of 
this intimacy. They had visited the conservatory 
and found some cheerful signs of coming bloom, 
and then Mrs. Bell had brought her sewing. 
Helen was' crocheting a bead bag, just then the 



delight of a girl's heart. The conversation had 
veered around to Daisy. 

"I don't know but that I ought to leave this 
for Daisy to tell you herself, but I would like 
you to know how I, how we feel about it. Daisy 
thinks she is very much in love and we are put- 
ting off the engagement, but I fancy they con- 
sider it that themselves. Mr. Duer left a large 
fortune to each child. Harlan Duer is twenty- 
four, is good-looking, well-mannered, was two 
years at Harvard and a year at a German uni- 
versity. He and Evelyn were abroad with this 
sister after the father died. They are very 
fashionable society people, yet I must admit not 
quite spoiled. Evelyn is what would be called a 
fascinating girl. She marries an Englishman 
who is an under secretary in some governmental 
position, indeed now she is his wife," smiling. 
"She took a tremendous fancy to Daisy, but I 
did not suppose it would be lasting. The three 
were a great deal together since Evelyn's lover 
could not be here. And then Daisy wanted them 
invited here, and to my surprise they came. 
Afterward they insisted that Daisy should come 
to the sister's in New York, Mrs. Newell, who 
it seems lives in elegant style. Willard went up 



 

there, too. And then the young man asked 
Daisy to marry him." 

"Oh I" Helen exclaimed in surprise. 

"The other engagements have been so satis- 
factory to us. Mr. Towne is not rich, but a fine, 
honorable man and has a good position in a 
bank. Mr. Hollis has from an old uncle a life 
income, the principal of which will go to his 
children. It is only a moderate one, but it makes 
him less dependent on his salary. I could not 
wish a better husband for Marjorie, and he has 
qualities which will win for him a fine standing 
in religious work. But this young man is a 
society idler, agreeable, has numberless charming 
traits ; mind, I do not call them qualities. I sup- 
pose most mothers would consider it an excellent 
match. But Daisy still seems such a child to us, 
and whether this is really love or only a girlish 
infatuation we cannot decide. Mr. Bell does not 
approve of it, although we have heard no deroga- 
tory stories about the young man. Several Cali- 
fornian friends have vouched for him. The trus- 
tee of the estate is very anxious for him to marry 
and settle down, though part of the fortune will 
be held in trust for children. But I am afraid
