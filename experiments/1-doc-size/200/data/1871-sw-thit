"A young people?" said Matilda, puzzled. "What do you mean by that?"

"Why yes; it was only in 1776 that we set up for ourselves."

"Seventeen seventy six," repeated Matilda. "And now it is eighteen"--

"Near a hundred years; that is all."

Matilda pondered a little.

"Where must I begin, Norton?"

"O with Romulus and Remus, I guess. And then there's grammar, Pink; did
you ever study grammar?"

"A little. I didn't like it."

"No, and I don't like it; but you have to learn it, for all that. And
geography, Pink?"

"O I was drawing maps, Norton; but then I had to come away from school,
and I was busy at aunt Candy's, and I have forgot nearly all I knew, I
am afraid."

"Never mind," said Norton delightedly; "we'll find it again, and a
great deal more. I'll get you some nice sheets of paper for your maps,
and a box of colours; so that you can make a pretty affair of them. I
declare! I don't know whether we can begin, though, before Christmas."

"O yes, Norton. I have more time than I know what to do with. I would
like to begin about Romus"--

"Romulus. Yes, you shall. And now, if we turn round here we shall not
have too much time to get home, I'm thinking."




CHAPTER X.


Matilda hardly knew whether to welcome Sunday. Her mind was in such a
whirl, she was half afraid to have leisure to think. There was little
chance however for that in the morning; late breakfast and dressing
disposed of the time nicely. The whole family went to church to-day,
David alone excepted; and Matilda was divided between delight in her
new cloak and rich dress, and a certain troubled feeling that all the
sweetness which used to belong to her Sundays in church at Shadywalk
was here missing. Nothing in the service gave her any help. Her dress,
to be sure, was merged in a crowd of just such dresses; silks and laces
and velvets and feathers and bright colours were on every side of her
and other brilliant colours streamed down from the painted windows of
the church. They were altogether distracting. It was impossible not to
notice the dash of golden light which lay across her own green silk
dress and glorified it, so far; or to help watching the effect of a
stream of crimson rays on Judy's blue. What a purple it made! The
colouring was not any more splendid or delicious indeed than one may
see in a summer sunset sky many a day; but somehow the effect on the
feelings was different. And when Matilda looked up again at the
minister and tried to get at the thread of what he was saying, she
found she had lost the connection; and began instead to marvel how he
would look, if the streak of blue which bathed his forehead were to
fall a little lower and lie across his mouth and chin. Altogether, when
the service was ended and the party walked home, Matilda did not feel
as if she had got any good or refreshment out of Sunday yet; more than
out of a kaleidoscope.

"I'll go to Mr. Rush's Sunday school this afternoon"--she determined,
as she was laying off her cloak.

There was no hindrance to this determination; but as Matilda crossed
the lower hall, ready to go out, she was met by Norton.

"Hollo," said he. "What's up now?"

"Nothing is up, Norton."

"Where are you going?"

So Matilda told him.

"Nothing else'll do, hey," said Norton. "Well,--hold on, till I get
into my coat."

"Why, are you going?"

"Looks like it," said Norton. "Why Pink, you are not fit to be trusted
in New York streets alone."

"I know where to go, Norton. But I am very glad you will go too."

"To take care of you," said Norton. "Why Pink, New York is a big trap;
and you would find yourself at the wrong end of a puzzle before you
knew it."

"I have only got two blocks more to go, Norton. I could hardly be
puzzled. Here, we turn down here."

It was no church, nor near a church, the building before which the two
paused. They went up a few steps and entered a little hare vestibule.
The doors giving further entrance were closed; a boy stood there as if
to guard them; and a placard with a few words on it was hung up on one
of them. The words were these

"And the door was shut."

"What sort of a place is this?" said Norton.

"This is the Sunday school," said Matilda. "They are singing; don't you
hear them? We are late."

"It seems a queer Sunday school," said Norton. "Don't they let folks in
here?"

"In ten minutes"--said the boy who stood by the door.

"Ten minutes!" echoed Norton. "It's quite an idea, to shut the door in
people's faces and then hang out a sign to tell them it is shut!"

"O no, Norton;--that door isn't this door."

"That isn't this?" said Norton. "What do you mean, Pink? Of course I
know so much; but it seems to me this is this."

"No, Norton; it means the door spoken of in the Bible--in the New
Testament;--don't you know? don't you remember?"

"Not a bit," said Norton. "I can't say, Pink, but it seems to me this
is not just exactly the place for you to come to Sunday school. Don't
look like it."

"Mr. Richmond told me to come here, you know, Norton."

But Norton looked with a disapproving eye upon what he could see of the
neighbourhood; and it is true that nobody would have guessed it was
near such a region as Blessington avenue. The houses were uncomely and
the people were poor; and more than that. There was a look of positive
want of respectability. But the little boy who was keeping the door was
decent enough; and presently now he opened the door and stood by to let
Norton and Matilda pass in.

There they found a large plain room, airy and roomy and light, filled
with children and teachers all in a great breeze of business. Everybody
seemed to be quite engrossed with something or other; and Norton and
Matilda slowly went up one of the long aisles between rows of classes,
waiting and looking for somebody to speak to them. The children seemed
to have no eyes to give to strangers; the teachers seemed to have no
time. Suddenly a young man stood in front of Norton and greeted the two
very cordially.

"Are you coming to join us?" he asked with a keen glance at them. And
as they did not deny it, though Norton hardly made an intelligible
answer, he led them up the room and at the very top introduced them to
a gentleman.

"Mr. Wharncliffe, will you take charge of these new comers? For to-day,
perhaps it will be the best thing."

So Norton and Matilda found themselves at one end of a circular seat
which was filled with the boys and girls of a large class. Very
different from themselves these boys and girls were; belonging to
another stratum of what is called society. If their dress was decent,
it was as much as could be said of it; no elegance or style was within
the aim of any of them; a faded frock was in one place, and a patched
pair of trowsers in another place, and not one of the little company
but shewed all over poverty of means and ignorance of fashion. Yet the
faces testified to no poverty of wits; intelligence and interest were
manifest on every one, along with the somewhat spare and pinched look
of ill supplied appetites. Norton read the signs, and thought himself
much out of place. Matilda read them; and shrank a little from the
association. However, she reflected that this was the first day of her
being in the school; doubtless when the people saw who and what she was
they would put her into a class more suited to her station. Then she
looked at the teacher; and she forgot her companions. He was a young
man, with a very calm face and very quiet manner, whose least word and
motion however was watched by the children, and his least look and
gesture obeyed. He sent one of the boys to fetch a couple of Bibles for
Matilda and Norton, and then bade them all open their books at the
first chapter of Daniel.

The first questions were about Nebuchadnezzar and his kingdom of
Babylon. Unknown subjects to most of the members of the class; Mr.
Wharncliffe had to tell a great deal about ancient history and
geography. He had a map, and he had a clear head of his own, for he
made the talk very interesting and very easy to understand; Matilda
found herself listening with much enjoyment. A question at last came to
her; why the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into the hands of the
king of Babylon? Matilda did not know. She was told to find the 25th
chapter of Jeremiah and read aloud nine verses.

"Now why was it?" said the teacher.

"Because the people would not mind the Lord's words."

The next question came to Norton. "Could the king of Babylon have taken
Jerusalem, if the Lord had not given it into his hands?"

Norton hesitated. "I don't know, sir," he said at length.
