soft voice calls, '' Lloyd ! " 

The child runs out on the porch, biit espying a strange 
figure, stands still, looking shyly out of great, resolute, 
dark eyes. They are not like Lloyd's ; more like Agatha's 
or his own. He is a strong, hardy, rather brilliant child, 
the picture of health, and bidding fair to inherit the 
Wentworth beauty. 

"Mamma ! " he says. 

''Lloyd, come in at once." 

"But, mamma, a gentleman — " 

Doris walks through the vestibule that is like a square 
room, but stands surprised and motionless when she sees 
her guest. 

" Mrs. Wentworth," he exclaims, holding out his hand 
cordially. "And this is your boy." 

This is the little being who had deprived him of his 
loved heritage. Doris colors redly. Then she ushers him 
within. Lloyd has been seized with the shyness that not 
infrequently makes children appear at their worst, but 
Marie comes to the rescue. Basil hardly knows whether 
he would like best to have him remain or not. Doris is , 
afraid the presence of the child may not prove agreeable. 

They have walked through to the drawing-room, ex- 
changing ordinary commonplaces, and now he is seated. 
Many alterations are apparent here. New pictures, some 
new furniture, but the well-remembered organ is at the 
farther end of the long room. 

"Olive — " he begins, rather hesitatingly. 

" Olive has gone out with Mr. Trevenna. They will be 
back at eight," she says, in her delicate manner. 

Doris is in white, a soft woollen fabric that falls in 
clinging folds and ends in a train lying now about her 
feet like small billows. Her only ornament is a cluster of 
purple pansies. The gold of her hair has not deepened, 
and the face still holds that wonderful childlike simplicity 



 



  

and purity, and though not mature, is thoughtful. A 
pretty, ladylike girl one would call her at a first glance. 
He says that to himself ; but aloud he answers her. 

"It is the first opportunity I have had to come in and 
congratulate her. Trevenna has seemed to belong to us " ; 
and a faint smile crosses his grave face. "But this is a 
nearer tie, and one can be confident that it is for Olive's 
happiness. I had not thought — I believe none of us ever 
contemplated marriage for Olive. No one could persuade 
her to go into society in early girlhood, and her health was 
so uncertain.'' He will make an effort to be just and give 
Doris the credit. "I don't know what magic you have 
used, but your companionship has worked a wonderful 
change." 

There must be a marvellous change for Reese Trevenna 
to desire her above all other women. 

"It has been her interest in others, her wider life, and 
— yes, it has been love," Doris says, with a sweet bravery, 
her eyes kindling as she speaks. " She has learned some 
of life's best lessons." 

Had no one the patience to teach her before? He 
feels self -condemned in the light of these clear, heaven- 
born eyes. 

"And you," he begins, abruptly. It will be better to 
get this part over before the return of the lovers. "Am 
I to congratulate you upon a coming change?" 

" Me ?" and she glances up. Then remembrance comes 
and she flushes distressfully. 

He is embarrassed momentarily. "My brother," he 
begins, in confusion ; she must not believe that he objects 
to the union. In saying that she is Graham's peer, he 
feels that he does not compliment her. 

"There is some mistake." He would hardly believe 
the face could shape itself to this fine haughtiness and 
display so much character. In an instant he is curiously 
interested. 



 



 



 

How shall she explain without humiliating him ? Why 
she should be tender of him is a puzzle, since he has 
shown no sf)ecial consideration for her at any period, but 
her heart is always merciful. To decline to enter the 
Wentworth family a second time may be unwisdom and 
a surprise to its various members save Olive. 

" If your brother — he Aa« discussed the subject, I know, 
but it was without my authority or consent," she says, 
with some confusion. 

Basil Wentworth crosses the apartment, takes her hand, 
and she rises with the impulse, so they stand facing each 
other. 

"Doris!" he exclaims, with a quick sympathy that is 
almost tenderness, quite unaware that he has used her 
Christian name, "do not for an instant imagine that you 
can be unwelcome this time. Let me say what has been 
in my secret heart for a long while, that no one can regret 
more bitterly than I our unkindness to the cousin we all 
loved. For it was to Mm as well as you. Do not hold 
it against us." 

She is in a sad perplexity. Shall she lose her golden 
opportunity by this that she must say ? Not even to win 
the regard of all can she marry Graham. 

" I have not promised anything — " she begins. 

"But you may with the utmost certainty." 

" I have nothing to promise, nothing to give." She 
withdraws her hand at this, and he looks surprised. Their 
overtures have come too late. " If you are all offended, 
I cannot help it. I do not love your brother. I cannot 
marry him." 

Basil studies her with something of the old impression. 
Is she a coquette ? Oh, surely not, with those heavenly 
eyes, with that pure sweet mouth ! 

" I think it is mostly one of many fancies on his part. 
We were friends, very good friends indeed. He was kind 
to me," — she will do him full justice, — " but when he 



 

spoke, I answered him frankly, I cannot be his wife now 
or ever." 

A vague impression finds lodgment in Basil's brain that 
this will be bad for Graham. He has been studying at 
intervals, for many other matters share his attention, 
demand it imperiously in fact, but it comes back as a 
kind of wondering remembrance now that a curious change 
has been going on in Graham. He has paid better attention 
to business, he has done some solid reading, held aloof from 
the crowds of purposeless young men in their frivolous 
pleasures, been more careful of that not uncommon bond- 
age to the social dissipation he,« Basil, has found so preva- 
lent in society circles. Is it the chance of redemption, 
the new starting-point ? Basil has learned ^ many things 
during this winter; he has been in an atmosphere sur- 
charged with the evils most lowering to manly standards. 
He is not so narrow or self-centred that he cannot see his 
brother's opportunity to take one step higher. 

"I wish you might," he replies, earnestly, — ''for 
Graham's sake. He would strive to make himself worthy. 
He is young, bright, joyous, and if he sometimes flies to 
extremes — " 

Her face arrests him. It has grown steadily colder, and 
settles into resolute lines. Yet, oh ! how fair and pure it 
is, how steadfast, how inwrapped, as if she folded herself 
in some snow-cloud ! 

His words have hurt her cruelly, but she dons this armor 
of coldness, and summons her forces to strike back. His 
care for his brother, his utter indifference to her, rouse 
her fire and spirit. 

"There might be some purpose in all this," she says, 
with a dignity that would do credit to Agatha, ' ' if with 
my hand I could give back the Wentworth heritage " ; and
