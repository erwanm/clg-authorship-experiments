WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MY LIFE? 

Miss Minturn's marriage is in everything the most 
striking contrast to that of her beautiful sister-in-law. 
She is married early in the morning at home, in her trav- 
elling-dress, and there are only the immediate relatives. 
Doris is invited, but some intangible influence holds her 
back, and the judge is not slow to express his vexation 
afterward. It was an olive-branch that she should not 
have failed to accept. 

For some reason, — is it that Westwater seeks to distin- 
guish itself above all other towns? — the season of the 
most elegant social life does not begin until late in 
August. People are tired then of journeying about, and 
cities have not put on their most seductive array. Water- 
ing-places have degenerated into fag-ends, — clerks and 
middle classes on brief vacations. But now for two or 
three months Westwater blossoms out like an enchanted 
land. Houses that have been shut up nearly all the year 
are opened. Lawns and the wide hospitable porches are 
brilliant with moving figures in soft and flowing robes and 
tints of cream and azure, with bits of color interspersed, 
and groups of children that may just have stepped out of 
a book. Young men lounging gracefully, dark-eyed or 
golden-haired girls swinging in hammocks in glints of 
sunshine and spaces of shade. Lawn-tennis and garden 
parties, a stately half-dozen or so of horseback riders to 
go cantering by, or the glittering roll of carriage wheels 
with their occupants in the perfection of indolent enjoy- 
ment. 



 



 



 

It seems to Doris almost like the brilliance of a foreign 
town. She drives out with her nurse and baby, and 
Olive or Mrs. Ashmead. Last year it was all so dif- 
ferent, with the Gilberts to assume proprietorship. A 
heat still flies up in Doris's face, and she takes herself to 
task for ingratitude as she thinks of them. Does she 
really owe her uncle any high duty that should demand a 
sacrifice ? And she cannot quite f oiget that it was through 
their ambition and grasping interventton that she has been 
placed in a false light and held up to disapproval. There 
is BO much to live down. Will all her glad young life be 
spent in the endeavor ? 

The marriages have been duly canvassed. The first 
cannot inspire a thought of dissent, and the second is 
warmly approved save by the few who know Basil best. 
That it seems a good marriage in a worldly sense is most 
true. Basil Wentworth is coming up rapidly. He has 
thrown his whole manful energy into his business, and 
friends congratulate the judge on his promising young 
colleague. Indeed, some of the older men do not hesi- 
tate to say that Lloyd's marriage, although seeming so 
hard to bear, has been a most excellent thing, and roused 
the best that was in Basil. Westwater has given him a 
generous sympathy, and now proffers a high admiration. 

It has held severely aloof from Mrs. Lloyd Wentworth, 
who was supposed to be a schemer and intrigante^ and 
who would no doubt endeavor to push herself into the 
circles that were always cordially open to her husband. 
But she has not even knocked at their doors. And at the 
wedding she looked a refined, well-bred little lady, to 
whom Mr. Stirling and Professor Wyse paid special atten- 
tion. They glance at her in the caniage, and more than 
one admits the exceeding purity of her refined, and — 
yes, pretty face. 

Beside the larger gayeties, there are quiet teas and 
social evenings. Doris is met at the Prescotts' and at 



 



 



 

Judge Minturn's, and she proves her right to her social 
standing, independent of her husband's prestige. From 
Mrs. Ashmead she has gathered many hints of West- 
water's social demands and usage, much more than from 
Olive's half -irony and animadversion. Olive sometimes 
accompanies her. She is now domesticated at the Elms. 
Larch Avenue is undergoing repairs and renovations for 
the bride, whose tour of the Lakes and Canada is to be 
but a month. 

There is also a mild discussion over Reese Trevenna 
throwing up such excellent prospects and turning his fine 
abilities to the church. It may be heroic, but more than 
one considers it a pity. His mother is a happy woman, 
for all of heaven seems opened to her in the granting of 
this, her life prayer, her heart's deske. He has come 
home again, and enrolled himself at the seminary, and 
taken the place in many respects that he held years ago. 

Agatha Stirling muses deeply over this. Whatever 
Trevenna may do cannot affect her, outwardly at least. 
She knows now, as she half supposed before, that his 
election was made with more direct reference to herself 
than the little world about her suspected. She has been 
proud of her influence to shape and restrain and deter- 
mine the future for others. Even now, so little has her 
marriage touched her, she still thinks a life akin to that 
olden one, where she could make her intellectual strength 
felt, and be the one peerless soul, with these adoring eyes 
turned to her with the absorbing interest that is not love, 
she would be quite as well content. But it is Doris Went- 
worth who spoiled and flawed that ambition. 

Olive is quite devotee. There is a half -surmise in the 
air that this is the inducement shining on Trevenna's 
path, but Agatha knows better. Still, it can matter 
nothing to her. 

"I liked your cousin's wife so much!" Mr. Stirling 
remarks one day. "She evinces remarkable taste and 



 



 



 

judgment for bo young a person, and displays a culture 
that is rather surprising. Is she going into society now? 
Why not ask her to a quiet little dinner with a few 
friends." 

" Yes," Agatha replies, with an absent acquiescence. 

Richmond Stirling looks at his beautiful wife, quite 
unconscious that she feels, rather than sees, the glance. 
He wanted her so much, he worshipped her from afar for 
so long a time, wondering if it was possible to transplant 
her into his life. He imagined he could add so much to 
it, could make it blossom and fruit, and come to a glorious 
harvest time. A little to his surprise, perhaps, he gained 
it, but it has not met his expectations ; it has not even 
blossomed any further, but stands still in stately radiance, 
fragrant, but he misses the vital glow and warmth, the 
keen interest that made all about her kindle with her own 
enthusiasm. She is very gentle, and defers to him 
readily ; she is an elegant mistress of his house ; nay, she 
is even solicitous about his comfort, wishes, and pleasures, 
but the elusive charm that lured one to follow on is no 
longer there. 

He does not know of any other dissatisfaction with 
Doris than that interfering with Basil's prospects, and 
certainly Basil makes no moan over it. Doris is in the 
family, and very charming he found her; so why not 
bring her into their circle, and brighten the young life 
that has already tasted deeply of the cup of sorrow ? 

Then he meets her one evening at the Minturns. She 
has driven over in the afternoon for some directions, and 
they have kept her to supper. There is only Mrs. Howard 
to entertain the few friends, and she begs her to stay. 
Judge Minturn is proud to present his pretty little client 
to two or three of these graybeards. But Mr. Stu-ling 
captures her, and they have a talk over Doris's life 
abroad. She tells her little incidents so simply ; they are
