" I'm not surprised the girl wants to know how you 
manage your problem — such a girl, standing in the 
shadow of the other world, which is always eclipsing 
this, and seeing how you've caught its awful outline." 

Verrian made a grateful murmur at the praise. 
" That is what my mother felt. Then you have no 
doubt of the good faith — " 

" No," the editor returned, with the same quantity, 
if not the same quality, of reluctance as before. " You 
see, it would be too daring." 

" Then why not let her have the proofs ?" 

" The thing is so unprecedented — " 

" Our doing it needn't form a precedent." 

" No." 

" And if you've no doubt of its being a true caso — " 

 

" We must prove that it is, or, rather, we must make 
her prove it. I quite feel with you ahout it. If I were 
to act upon my own impulse, my own convictions, I 
should send her the rest of the story and take the 
chances. But she may be an enterprising journalist 
in disguise — it's astonishing what women will do when 
they take to newspaper work — and we have no right 
to risk anything, for the magazine's sake, if not yours 
and mine. Will you leave this letter with me ?" 

" I expected to leave the whole affair in your hands. 
Do you mind telling me what you propose to do ? Of 
course, it won't be anything — abrupt — " 

" Oh no ; and I don't mind telling you what has oc- 
curred to me. If this is a true case, as you say, and 
I've no question but it is, the writer will be on con- 
fidential terms with her pastor as well as her doctor; 
and I propose asking her to get him to certify, in any 
sort of general terms, to her identity. I will treat the 
matter delicately — Or, if you prefer to write to her 
yourself — " 

" Oh no, it's much better for you to do it ; you can 
do it authoritatively." 

" Yes, and if she isn't the real thing, but merely 
a woman journalist trying to work us for a ' story ' in 
her Sunday edition, we shall hear no more from her." 

" I don't see anything to object to in your plan," 
Verrian said, upon reflection. " She certainly can't 
complain of our being cautious." 

" No, and she won't. I shall have to refer the matter 
to the house — " 

"Oh, will you?" 

"Why, certainly! I couldn't take a step like that 
without the approval of the house." 

" No," Verrian assented, and he made a note of the 
writer's address from the letter. Then, after a moment 



spent in looking hard at the letter, he gave it back to the 
editor and went abruptly away. 

He had proof, the next morning, that the editor had 
acted promptly, at least so far as regarded the house. 
The house had approved his plan, if one could trust the 
romantic paragraph which Verrian found in his paper 
at breakfast, exploiting the fact concerned as one of the 
interesting evidences of the hold his serial had got with 
the magazine readers. He recognized in the paragraph 
the touch of the good fellow who prepared the weekly 
bulletins of the house, and offered the press literary 
intelligence in a form ready for immediate use. The 
case was fairly stated, but the privacy of the author's 
correspondent was perfectly guarded; it was not even 
made known that she was a woman. Yet Verrian felt, 
in reading the paragraph, a shock of guilty dismay, as 
if he had betrayed a confidence reposed in him, and 
he handed the paper across the table to his mother with 
rather a sick look. 

After his return from the magazine office the day be- 
fore, there had been a good deal of talk between them 
about that girl. Mrs. Verrian had agreed with him 
that no more interesting event could have happened to 
an author, but she had tried to keep him from taking 
it too personally, and from making himself mischievous 
illusions from it. She had since slept upon her anxie- 
ties, with the effect of finding them more vivid at 
waking, and she had been casting about for an opening 
to penetrate him with them, when fortune put this 
paragraph in her way. 

"Isn't it disgusting?" he asked. "I don't see how 
Armiger could let them do it. I hope to heaven she'll 
never see it!" 

His mother looked up from the paragraph and asked, 

"Why?" 

 

" Why ? What would she think of me ?" 

" I don't know. She might have expected something 
of the kind." 

" How expect something of the kind ? Am I one of 
the self -advertisers ?" 

" Well, she must have realized that she was doing 
rather a bold thing." 

"Bold?" 

" Venturesome," Mrs. Verrian compromised to the 
kindling anger in her son's eyes. 

" I don't understand you, mother. I thought you 
agreed with me about the writer of that letter — her 
sincerity, simplicity." 

" Sincerity, yes. But simplicity — Philip, a thor- 
oughly single-minded girl never wrote that letter. You 
can't feel such a thing as I do. A man couldn't. You 
can paint the character of women, and you do it won- 
derfully — but, after all, you can't know them as a 
woman does." 

" You talk," he answered, a little sulkily, " as if 
you knew some harm of the girl." 

" No, my son, I know nothing about her, except that 
she is not single-minded, and there is no harm in not 
being single-minded. A great many single-minded 
women are fools, and some double-minded women are 
good." 

"Well, single-minded or double-minded, if she is 
what she says she is, what motive on earth could she 
have in writing to me except the motive she gives ? You 
don't deny that she tells the truth about herself ?" 

" Don't I say that she is sincere ? But a girl doesn't 
always know her own motives, or all of them. She 
may have written to you because she would like to 
begin a correspondence with an author. Or she may 
have done it out of the love of excitement. Or for 




the sake of distraction, to get away from herself and 
her gloomy forebodings." 

" And should you blame her for that ?" 

" No, I shouldn't. I should pity her for it. But, all 
the same, I shouldn't want you to be taken in by her." 

" You think, then, she doesn't care anything about 
the story?" 

" I think, very probably, she cares a great deal about 
it. She is a serious person, intellectually at least, and 
it is a serious story. Eo wonder she would like to 
know, at first hand, something about the man who 
wrote it." 

This flattered Verrian, but he would not allow its 
reasonableness. He took a gulp of coffee before saying, 
uncandidly, " I can't make out what you're driving at, 
mother. But, fortunately, there's no hurry about your 
meaning. The thing's in the only shape we could pos- 
sibly give it, and I am satisfied to leave it in Armiger's 
hands. I'm certain he will deal wisely with it — and 
kindly." 

" Yes, I'm sure he'll deal kindly. I should be very 
unhappy if he didn't. He could easily deal more wise- 
ly, though, than she has." 

Verrian chose not to follow his mother in this. " All 
is," he said, with finality, " I hope she'll never see that 
loathsome paragraph."
