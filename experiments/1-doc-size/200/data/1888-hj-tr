indefinite stay. They couldn 't face their life in 
Paris. For himself, he was in the breach, fighting 



hard and making, on her behalf, asseverations 
which it was impossible for him to believe, in 
spite of the dreadful defiant confession she had 
appeared to throw at him in the morning, that 
she would not virtually confirm. He would come 
in as soon after nine as possible ; the morrow, up 
to that time, would be severe in the Cours la 
Heine, and he begged her in the meantime not 
to doubt of his perfect tenderness. So far from 
his distress having made it less he had never yet 
felt so much that she had, in his affection, a 
treasure of indulgence to draw upon. 

A couple of hours after this letter arrived 
Francie lay on one of the satin sofas with her eyes 
closed and her hand clinched upon it in her pocket. 
Delia sat near her with a needle in her fingers, 
certain morsels of silk and ribbon in her lap, several 
pins in her mouth, and her attention wandering 
constantly from her work to her sister s face. 
The weather was now so completely vernal that 
Mr. Dosson was able to sit in the court, and he 
had lately resumed this practice, in which he 
was presumably at the present moment absorbed. 
Delia had lowered her needle and was watching 
Francie, to see if she were not asleep she had 
been perfectly still for so long when her glance 
was drawn to the door, which she heard pushed open. 
Mr. Flack stood there, looking from one to the 
other of the young ladies, as if to see which of 
them would be most agreeably surprised by his visit. 





" I saw your father down stairs he says it s 
all right," said the journalist, advancing and smil 
ing. " He told me to come straight up I had 
quite a talk with him." 

"All right all right ?" Delia Dosson repeated, 
springing up. "Yes, indeed, I should say so." 
Then she checked herself, asking in another 
manner : " Is that so ? father sent you up ? " 
And then, in still another : " Well, have you 
had a good time at Nice ? " 

"You'd better all come down and see. It s 
lovely down there. If you 'll come down I 'll go 
right back. I guess you want a change," Mr. 
Flack went on. He spoke to Delia but he looked 
at Francie, who showed she had not been asleep 
by the quick consciousness with which she raised 
herself on her sofa. She gazed at the visitor with 
parted lips, but she said nothing. He hesitated a 
moment, then came toward her, smiling, with his 
hand out. His bright eyes were brighter than 
ever, but they had an odd appearance of being 
smaller, like penetrating points. " Your father 
has told me all about it. Did you ever hear of 
anything so ridiculous ? " 

"All about what? all about what?" said 
Delia, whose attempt to represent happy ignorance 
seemed likely to be spoiled by an intromission of 
ferocity. She might succeed in appearing ignorant, 
but she could scarcely succeed in appearing 
happy. Francie had risen to her feet and had 


suffered Mr. Flack to possess himself for a moment 
of her hand, but neither of the girls had asked 
the young man to sit down. " I thought you were 
going to stay a month at Nice," Delia continued. 

"Well, I was, but your fathers letter started 
me up." 

"Father s letter?" 

" He wrote me about the row didn 't you know 
it? Then I broke. You didn 't suppose I was 
going to stay down there when there were such 
times up here." 

" Gracious ! " Delia exclaimed. 
" Is it pleasant at Nice ? Is it very gay ? Isn 't 
it very hot now?" Francie asked. 

" Oh, it s all right. But I haven 't come up here 
to talk about Nice, have I ? " 

Why not, if we want to ? " Delia inquired. 
Mr. Flack looked at her for a moment very 
hard, in the whites of the eyes ; then he replied, 
turning back to her sister: "Anything you like, 
Miss Francie. With you one subject is as good 
as another. Can 't we sit down ? Can 't AVC be 
comfortable?" he added. 

" Comfortable ? of course we can ! " cried Delia, 
but she remained erect while Francie sank upon 
the sofa again and their companion took posses 
sion of the nearest chair. 

" Do you remember what I told you once, that 
the people will have the plums ? " George Flack 
asked of the younger girl. 





She looked for an instant as if she were trying 
to recollect what he had told her ; then she said, 
" Did father write to you ? " 

"Of course he did. That s why I'm here." 

" Poor father, sometimes he doesn 't know what 
to do ! " Delia remarked. 

"He told me the Reverberator has made a 
sensation. I guessed that for myself, when I saw 
the way the papers here were after it. That thing 
will go the round you 'll see ! What brought me 
was learning from him that they have got their 
backs up." 

" What on earth are you talking about ? " cried 
Delia. 

Mr. Flack turned his eyes on hers in the same 
way as a moment before; Francie sat there 
serious, looking hard at the carpet. " What game 
are you trying, Miss Delia? It ain 't true you 
care what I wrote, is it ? " he pursued, addressing 
himself again to Francie. 

She raised her eyes. "Did you write it 
yourself ? " 

"Wliat do you care what he wrote or what 
does any one care ? " Delia broke in. 

" It has done the paper more good than any 
thing every one is so interested," said Mr. Flack, 
in the tone of reasonable explanation. " And you 
don 't feel that you have anything to complain of, 
do you ? " he added, to Francie, kindly. 

"Do you mean because I told you ? " 







" Why, certainly. Didn 't it all spring out of 
that lovely drive and that walk in the Bois that 
we had, when you took me to see your portrait ? 
Didn 't you understand that I wanted you to know 
that the public would appreciate a column or 
two about Mr. Waterlow s new picture, and about 
you as the subject of it, and about your being 
engaged to a member of the grand mcnde, and 
about what was going on in the grand monde, 
which would naturally attract attention through 
that ? Why, Miss Francie, you talked as if you 
did." 

" Did I talk a great deal ? " asked Francie. 

" Why, most freely it was too lovely. Don 't 
you remember when we sat there in the Bois ? " 

"Oh, rubbish !" Delia ejaculated. 

" Yes, and Mine, de Cliche passed." 

"And you told me she was scandalised. And 
we laughed it struck us as idiotic. I said it 
was affected and pretentious. Your father tells 
me she is scandalised now she and all the rest 
of them at their names appearing in the Rever 
berator. I don 't hesitate to declare that that s 
affected and pretentious too. It ain 't genuine 
and if it is it doesn 't count. They pretend to be 
shocked because it looks exclusive, but in point 
of fact they like it first-rate." 

" Are you talking about that old piece in 
the paper? Mercy, wasn 't that dead and buried
