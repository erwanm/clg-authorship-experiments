and the brilliantly lighted theatre flashed its colours 
and splendours upon them. The floor of the pit had 
been levelled to that of the stage, which, stripped of 
the scenic apparatus, opened vaster spaces for the 
motley crew already eddying over it in the waltz. 
The boxes, tier over tier, blazed with the light of 
candelabra which added their sparkle to that of the 
gas jets. 

"You and Effie go before, said Mrs. Bowen to 
Imogene. She made them take hands like children, 
and mechanically passed her own hand through Col- 
ville's arm. 

A mask in red from head to foot attached him- 
self to the party, and began to make love to her in 
excellent pantomime. 



 

Colville was annoyed. He asked her if he should 
tell the fellow to take himself off. 

"Not on any account!" she answered. "It's 
perfectly delightful. It wouldn't be the veglione 
without it Did you ever see such good acting ? " 

" I don't think it 's remarkable for anything but 
its fervour," said Colville. 

" I should like to see you making love to some 
lady," she rejoined mischievously. 

" I will make love to you, if you like," he said, 
but he felt in an instant that his joke was in bad 
taste. 

They went the round of the theatre. " That is 
Prince Strozzi, Imogene,'' said Mrs. Bowen, leaning 
forward to whisper to the girl. She pointed out 
other people of historic and aristocratic names in the 
boxes, where there was a democracy of beauty 
among the ladies, all painted and powdered to the 
same marquise effect. 

On the floor were gentlemen in evening dress, 
without masks, and here and there ladies waltzing, 
who had masks but no dominoes. But for the most 
part people were in costume ; the theatre flushed 
and flowered in gay variety of tint that teased the 
eye with its flow through the dance. 

Mrs. Bowen had circumscribed the adventure so 
as to exclude dancing from it. Imogene was not to 
dance. One might go to the vegUone and look on 
from a box ; if one ventured further and went on 
the floor, decidedly one was not to dance. 

This was thoroughly understood beforehand, and 



 

there were to be no petitions or murmurs at the 
theatre. They found a quiet corner, and sat down 
to look on. 

The mask in red followed, and took his place at a 
little distance, where, whenever Mrs. Bowen looked 
that way, he continued to protest his passion. 

"You're sure he doesn't bore joni" suggested 
ColviUe. 

" No, indeed. He 's very amusing." 

" Oh, all right ! " 

The waltz ceased ; the whirling and winding con- 
fusion broke into an irregular streaming hither and 
thither, up and down. They began to pick out 
costumes and characters that interested them. 
Clowns in white, with big noses, and harlequins in 
their motley, with fiat black masks, abounded. 
There were some admirable grasshoppers in green, 
with long antennae quivering from their foreheads. 
Two or three Mephistos reddened through the 
crowd. Several knights in armour got about with 
difficulty, apparently burdened by their greaves and 
breastplates. 

A group of leaping and dancing masks gathered 
around a young man in evening dress, with long 
hair, who stood leaning against a pillar near them, 
and who underwent their mockeries with a smile of 
patience, half amused, half tormented. 

When they grew tired of baiting him, and were 
looking about for other prey, the red mask re- 
doubled his show of devotion to Mrs. Bowen, and 
the other masks began to flock round and approve. 



 

" Oh, now,'' she said, with a little embarrassed > 
laugh, in which there was no displeasure, " I think 
you may ask him to go away. But don't be harsh 
with him," she added, at a brusque movement which 
Colville made toward the mask. 

" Oh, why should I be harsh with him ? We 're 
not rivals." This was not in good taste either, Col- 
ville felt. " Besides, I 'm an Italian too," he said, 
to retrieve himself. He made a few paces toward 
the mask, and said in a low tone, with gentle sug- 
gestion, " Madame finds herself a little incommoded." 

The mask threw himself into an attitude of bur- 
lesque despair, bowed low with his hand on his 
heart, in token of submission, and vanished into 
the crowd. The rest dispersed with cries of ap- 
plause. 

" How very prettily you did it, both of you ! " 
said Mrs. Bowen. " I begin to believe you are an 
Italian, Mr. Colville. I shall be afraid of you." 

"You weren't afraid of him." 

" Oh, he was a real Italian." 

" It seems to me that mamma is getting all the 
good of the -veglione,'' said Effie, in a plaintive mur- 
mur. The well-disciplined child must have suffered 
deeply before she lifted this seditious voice. 

"Why, so I am, Elfie," answered her mother, 
" and I don't think it 's fair myself. What shall we 
do about it ? " 

"I should like something to eat," said the child. 

" So should I," said Colville. " That 's reparation 
your mother owes us all. Let 's make her take us 

and get us something. Wouldn't you like an ice, 
Miss Graham ? " 

"Yes, an ice," said Imogene, with an effect of 
adding, "Nothing more for worlds," that made 
Colville laugh. She rose slowly, like one in a 
dream, and cast a look as impassioned as a look 
could be made through a mask on the scene she was 
leaving behind her. The band was playing a waltz 
again, and the wide floor swam with circling 
couples. 

The corridor where the tables were set was 
thronged with people, who were drinking beer and 
eating cold beef and boned turkey and slices of huge 
round sausages. " Oh, how can they ? " cried the 
girl, shuddering. 

" I didn't know you were so ethereal-minded about 
these things," said Colville. " I thought you didn't 
object to the salad at Madame Uccelli's." 

" Oh, but at the veglione ! " breathed the girl for 
all answer. He laughed again, but Mrs. Bowen did 
not laugh with him ; he wondered why. 

When they returned to their corner in the theatre 
they found a mask in a black domino there, who 
made place for them, and remained standing near. 
They began talking freely and audibly, as English- 
speaking people incorrigibly do in Italy, where their 
tongue is all but the language of the country. 

" Eeally," said Colville, " I think I shall stifle in 
this mask. If you ladies will do what you can to 
surround me and keep me secret, I 'll take it off a 
moment." ' 



 

"I believe I will join you, Mr. Colville," said the 
mask near them. He pushed up his little visor of 
silk, and discovered the mild, benignant features of 
Mr. Waters. 

" Bless my soul ! " cried Colville. 

Mrs. Bowen was apparently too much shocked to
