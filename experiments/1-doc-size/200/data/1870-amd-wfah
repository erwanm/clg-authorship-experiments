certainly borne good fruit. 

" So, I shall turn the quarry over into your hands, young 
sir, making only one stipulation. There shall be no drunken 
ness, that curse of the cities." 

" But Hurst's workmen must of necessity be different from 
yours," explained Trewartha. "They will be rough men 
from the town, with no families and no flower-gardens to 
occupy their leisure moments." 

"There's not a pint of liquor to be bought in the village," 
she returned, testily. " If they bring their rum with them 
and drink it out of hours, I hardly know how it can be 
prevented ; but he shall make this rule the first man he 
finds under the influence of liquor shall be discharged. Tell 
them that in the beginning." 

"I will," he said, heartily, remembering how his father 
had fought against the demon of intemperance.

Janet McRae looked up at Doctor Trewartha in the most 
beatific triumph. 

"You are rabid Father Matthew crusaders," he said, with a 
short laugh. "I wish you would come over to the Cedars 
and take a bottle of wine with me. I have some choice, I 
assure you." 

"I have undertaken no crusade against you strong-brained 
people, who have plenty of money to spend, purchase the best 
always, and can afford to sleep all the morning when you have 
held an orgie over-night. It is for the poor wretches who 
starve their wives and children that they may buy vile, poison 
ous stuff that transforms them into something worse than brute 
beasts. If I cannot have the Cragness community sober, I'll 
close the workshops and nail up the cottage-doors. " 

It was her hobby to map out the duties and privileges of 
those who were in any manner subordinate, and Doctor Tre 
wartha confessed inwardly that the plan had not worked ill. 
There were a great many people in the world incapable of 
leading even themselves. 

In the course of a few days the matter was arranged satis 
factorily. Victor felt quite elated. 

" I am glad we came," he said to his mother. "There will 
be an opportunity to make something above our bare living. 
Mrs. McRae was very generous ; for after I had accepted it 
for half the profit, she was afraid that would not be enough ; 
but I am not willing to subject myself to any obligation that 
may gall me by-and-by. I want to remain quite unfettered." 

"Yes ;" with a little sigh. If it had been different. 

"We are to take the cottage. I thought you would like 
better to have a home of your own again. It is a pretty, quiet 
little place ; and here there will be guests coming and going 
continually." 

"It is much better." 

She spoke the simple truth. Indeed, there had been times 
when she felt almost stifled with the luxury for which she 



 

could make no return ; and the sense of supervision that clung 
about her like a shadow. 

As for Victor, he threw himself, heart and soul, into the 
new life. He was not likely to stint ambition or energy in an 
interest which promised as much as this. 

He found in Doctor Trewartha a staunch and peculiar 
friend. His experience in this respect had been rather limited ; 
and the secret in the depths of his soul disposed him to the 
cautiousness one hardly expects of youth. But this man was 
wonderfully fascinating, with his rich, varying moods, his vigor, 
when he chose to call it to the surface, his brilliancy; and the 
half-cynical, half-tender vein perplexed and pleased, lured 
onward, and yet never satisfied. 

By the middle of May they were settled in their new home. 
Ruth had supervised it with her housewifely instincts. Mrs. 
Hurst had drawn quite near to the girl during the past month. 
There was a restful quality in her grave nature, very grateful 
indeed to the woman who had been so long tried with sharp, 
irritable nerves and restless brains, and haunted by a tragic 
under-current. For Ruth had a broad, calm surface, like a 
fair lake, with no hint of storms. It is true that many of these 
women go through life without ever having been roused to one 
magnificent emotion. 

She took a warm interest in the Hursts, partly, perhaps, 
because she had been bidden so to do ; but there was some 
thing in the sad matron's gentleness, the hopeless invalidism 
of the husband, and the energy of the son, that attracted her 
more strongly than anything hitherto in her uneventful life : 
quite a new element at Cragness. Somehow she began to 
feel the burden of the swathing-bands wrapped around her by 
kind hands of friendship, and there were moments when she 
longed to tear them off if she but knew where to begin. A 
new soul was moving upon the face of the waters, troubling it. 



CHAPTER XX. 

THEY were so much engrossed at Cragness, Sylvia Redmond 
thought, that she was fast dropping out of sight or mind. She 
had too much vanity to take neglect complacently ; and then 
the days at cousin Braisted's were monotonous. Even Doctor 
Trewartha was busy, and Black Dick used to traverse the road 
with his long, sweeping gallop, just giving his master time to 
touch his hat to her as he passed. 

And then Victor Hurst was winning golden opinions, becom 
ing quite a hero. Even Ruth was moved from her self-poise, 
and admired with an interest quite new to her. The quarry 
was in successful operation, and a possible fortune hidden in 
its gray depths. 

This lovely golden June afternoon Sylvia had managed to 
get away by herself. She came down stairs in her pretty 
riding costume and her dainty chip hat, with its long white 
plume, sent a week before with a box full of elegant attire, 
part of her mother's purchases in New York. 

"I am going to Cragness," she announced to invalid Re 
becca, who sat placidly knitting. 

Rebecca had a message for friend Janet. Sylvia listened, 
flicking her pearl-handle whip. Somehow she was not in her 
usual delightful humor. 

Indeed, she felt cross. Her mother's letter fretted her. 
She had been sorry to come to this dull little place ; but it 
was that or school, which she disliked still more. For the 
frivolous fashionable woman, a faded beauty, yet a favorite 
with society, had no mind to be troubled with a pretty, wilful 
girl, until she saw some advantages for her. She wanted hei 
glories and her ease quite to herselC 



 

But now, when she was not of the slightest account to any 
one, she told herself that she did not want to go. Every tree 
suddenly took on a peculiar nearness. Yet there was the sen 
tence. In about ten days Mrs. Redmond expected to come 
for her, and promised her a gay summer. Among other gos 
sip, she wrote "Eustace Gilliat returned in March." 

Six months ago it would have proved unfeigned pleasure. 
She was no more used to analyzing or reasoning than Ruth 
Gamier, though her internal processes were so much more 
rapid. But of late it seemed as if she had not been happy, 
and was every day drifting farther and farther away. 

Madame McRae and Ruth were out. So then Sylvia felt 
quite at liberty to ramble about at her own sweet will ; and she 
turned her pony's head villageward. She would doubtless meet 
them there. 

She found herself, after a brisk canter, in the vicinity of the 
quarry ; and though the intervening trees hid the excavation, 
she heard the steady, monotonous drilling. Obeying the first 
impulse that swayed her, she bent her course toward the moun 
tain-side, and wandered slowly round the little ledge, until 
startled by a sight that brought the quick blood to her 
cheeks. 

Just at her feet, it seemed, was a curious, half-hidden nook, 
embowered by a thicket of dwarfed pines, and carpeted by 
rank mosses. A large flat stone was spread out like a desk or 
table, and before it sat Victor Hurst, his hair thrown back from 
his wide white brow, and his eyes intent upon something before 
him a drawing done in crayon, and a block of the gray 
quarry-stone, at which he was hammering with mallet and 
chisel. 

Her quick brain took it in at once, and her heart gave an 
exultant bound. The pony's feet crackled the dry branches, 
breaking the student's solitude, and he glanced up. She nod 
ded, with her gay little laugh, elfin and mischievous. 

He scrambled the few articles hurriedly together, and with
