past all magic in the defeat of his followers at Marston 
Moor by Cromwell. The city yielded to the Puritans, 
whose temperament had already rather characterized it. 
James II., as Duke of York, made it his brief sojourn ; 
" proud Cumberland," returning from Culloden after 
the defeat of the Pretender, visited the city and re- 
ceived its freedom for destroying the last hope of the 
Stuarts; perhaps the twenty-two rebels who were then 
put to death in York were executed in the very square 
where those wicked men thought I was wanting to play 
the horses. The reigning family has paid divers visits 
to the ancient metropolis, which was the capital of 
Britain before London was heard of. The old prophecy 
of her ultimate primacy must make time if it is to 
fulfil itself and increase York's seventy-two thousand 
beyond London's six million.

I should be at a loss to say why* its English memo- 
ries haunted my York less than the Roman associations 
of the place. They form, however, rather a clutter of 
incidents, whereas the few spreading facts of Hadrian's 
stay, the deaths of Severus and Constantius, and the 
election of Constantine, his son, enlarge themselves to 
the atmospheric compass of the place, but leave a 
roominess in which the fancy may more commodi- 
ously orb about. I was on terms of more neighborly 
intimacy with the poor Punic emperor than with any 
one else in York, doubtless because, when he fell sick, 
he visited the temple of Bellona near Bootham Bar, 



and paid his devotions unmolested, let us hope, by any 
prevision of the misbehavior of his son Caracalla 
(whose baths I had long ago visited at Rome) in 
killing his other son Geta. Everywhere I could be an 
early Christian, in company with Constantine, in whom 
the instinct of political Christianity must have begun 
to stir as soon as he was chosen emperor. But I dare 
say I heard the muted tramp of the Sixth Legion about 
the Yorkish streets above all other martial sounds be- 
cause I stayed as long as Doncaster Week would let 
me in the railway hotel, which so many of their bones 
made room for when the foundations of it were laid, 
with those of the adherent station. Their bones seem 
to have been left there, after the disturbance, but their 
sepulchres were respectfully transferred to the museum 
of the Philosophical Society, in the grounds where the 
ruins of St. Mary's Abbey rise like fragments of pen- 
sive music or romantic verse, inviting the moonlight 
and the nightingale, but, wanting these, make shift 
with the noonday and the babies in perambulators neg- 
lected by nurse-girls reading novels. 

The babies and the nurses are not allowed in the 
museum of antiquities, which is richer in Roman re- 
mains than any that one sees outside of Italy. There 
are floors of mosaic, large and perfect, taken from the 
villas which people are always digging up in the neigh- 
borhood of York, and, from the graves uncovered in the 
railway excavations, coffins of lead and stone for civ- 
ilians, and of rude tiles for the soldiers of the Sixth 
Legion; the slaves were cast into burial-pits of tens 
and twenties and left to indiscriminate decay till they 
should be raised in the universal incorruption. Prob- 
ably the slaves were the earliest Christians at York; 
certainly the monuments are pagan, as the inmates of 

the tombs must have been. Some of the monuments 

 

bear inscriptions from loving wives and husbands to 
the partners they have lost, and some of the stone coffins 
are those of children. It is all infinitely touching, and 
after two thousand years the heart aches for the fathers 
and mothers who laid their little ones away in these 
hard cradles for their last sleep. Faith changes, but 
constant death remains the same, and life is not very 
different in any age, when it comes to the end. The 
Roman exiles who had come so far to hold my British 
ancestors in subjection to their alien rule seemed es- 
sentially not only of the same make as me, but the 
same civilization. Their votive altars and inscriptions 
to other gods expressed a human piety of like anxiety 
and helplessness with ours, and called to a like irre- 
sponsive sky. A hundred witnesses of their mortal 
state jars and vases and simple household utensils 
fill the shelves of the museum ; but the most awful, the 
most beautiful appeal of the past is in that mass of 
dark auburn hair which is kept here in a special urn 
and uncovered for your supreme emotion. It is equally 
conjectured to be the hair of a Roman lady or of a 
British princess, but is of a young girl certainly, dress- 
ed twenty centuries ago for the tomb in which it was 
found, and still faintly lucent with the fashionable 
unguent of the day, and kept in form by pins of jet. 
One thinks of the little, slender hands that used to put 
them there, and of the eyes that confronted themselves 
in the silver mirror under the warm shadow that the 
red -gold mass cast upon the white forehead. This 
sanctuary of the past was the most interesting place 
in that most interesting city of York, and the day of 
our first visit a princess of New York sat reading a 
book in the midst of it, waiting for the rain to be 
over, which was waiting for her to come out and then 
begin again. We knew her from having seen her at 


the station in relation to some trunks bearing her in- 
itials and those of her native city; and she could be 
about the age of the York princess or young Roman 
lady whose hair was kept in the urn hard by. 



There is in York a little, old, old church, whose dear 
and reverend name I have almost forgotten, if ever I 
knew it, but I think it is Holy Trinity Goodramgate, 
which divides the heart of my adoration with the Min- 
ster. We came to it quite by accident, one of our sad 
September afternoons, after we had been visiting the 
Guildhall, Venetianly overhanging the canal calm of 
the Ouse, and very worthy to be seen for its York 
histories in stained glass. The custodian had surprised 
us and the gentlemen of the committee by taking us 
into the room where they were investigating the claims 
of the registered voters to the suffrage; and so, much 
entertained and instructed, we issued forth, and, pass- 
ing by the church in which Guy Fawkes was baptized, 
only too ineffectually, we came quite unexpectedly upon 
Holy Trinity Goodramgate, if that and not another is 
indeed its name. N 

It stands sequestered in a little leafy and grassy 
space of its own, with a wall hardly overlooked on one 
side by low stone cottages, the immemorial homes of 
rheumatism and influenza. The church had the air of 
not knowing that it is of Perpendicular and Decorated 
Gothic, with a square, high - shouldered tower, as it 
bulks up to a very humble height from the turf to 
the boughs overhead, or that it has a nice girl sketching 
its doorway, where a few especially favored weddings 
and funerals may enter. It is open once a year for 

 

service, and when the tourist will, or can, for the sight 
of the time-mellowed, beautiful stained glass of its east- 
ward window. The oaken pews are square and high- 
shouldered, like the low church tower; and, without, 
the soft yellow sandstone is crumbling away from the 
window traceries. The church did not look as if it 
felt itself a thousand years old, and perhaps it is not; 
but I never was in a place where I seemed so like a 
ghost of that antiquity. I had a sense of haunting it, 
in the inner twilight and the outer sunlight, where a 
tender wind was stirring the leaves of its embowering 
trees and scattering them on the graves of my eleventh 
and twelfth century contemporaries.

We chose the sunniest morning we could for our 
visit to Clifford's Tower, which remains witness of the 
Norman castle the Conqueror built and rebuilt to keep 
the Danish-Anglian-Roman-British town in awe. But 
the tower was no part of the original castle, and only 
testifies of it by hearsay. That was built by Roger do 
Clifford, who suffered death with his party chief, the 
Earl of Lancaster, when Edward of York took the city, 
and it is mainly memorable as the refuge of the Jews 
whom the Christians had harried out of their homes. 
They had grown in numbers and riches, when the Jew- 
hate of 1190 broke out in England, as from time to 
time the Jew-hate breaks out in Russia now, to much 
the same cruel effect. They were followed and be- 
sieged in the castle, and, seeing that they must be 
captured, they set fire to the place, and five hundred 
slew themselves. Some that promised to be Christians 
came out and were killed by their brethren in Christ. 



In New York the Christians have grown milder, and 
now they only keep the Jews out of their clubs and 
their homes. 

The Clifford Tower leans very much to one side, so 
that as you ascend it for the magnificent view from the 
top you have to incline yourself the other way, as you 
do in the Tower of Pisa, to help it keep its balance.
