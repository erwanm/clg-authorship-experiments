Brinsley's, and a cordial recognition of his courage 
and ability. A more vigorous life seemed marked 
out for him. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

THE BUTTERFLY'S BRIEF SUMMER 

MRS. OTIS had been much interested through 
the winter in a Home for convalescents under 
taken by some kindly women, among whom were 
two enthusiastic young physicians. There seemed 
a great need of a house of rest for girls and 
women who had no comfortable place to spend the 
interim between the Hospital discharge and the 
establishment of normal strength to enable them 
to take up the daily work of life again. 

One morning early in May Helen wended .her 
way thither, being on the list of helpers for that 
week. The Home was not able to dispense with 
this kindly assistance as yet. 

" Oh," the matron exclaimed, " you are just the 
one we want to come and read. There are three 
poor women who cannot use their eyes. So few 
people read well, and among the patients no one 
has a really good voice. Miss Guyon was here 
yesterday, and they enjoyed her so much." 

Helen expressed her willingness, and laid aside 
her wraps. Then they entered a large, airy 


room, very simply furnished, but with several 
easy chairs. Two women sat sewing, both re 
covering from a severe attack of bronchitis. One 
still had her arm in a sling. Two others had a 
shade over their eyes ; but one, who sat in a high- 
backed rocker by the window, glanced up at the 
sound of the footsteps, yet her eyes seemed to 
wander about vaguely. 

Helen gave a sudden start. 

"That poor girl has been badly burned," ex 
plained Mrs. Laird. " Mrs. Van Cort brought her 
here. Some friends pay a generous board for 
her, but I believe her case has not been positively 
decided upon. She was an actress, and met with 
a sad accident. The burns are healed, and her 
hair is beginning to grow again. She can dis 
tinguish light and darkness with one eye, and 
she counts confidently on having her sight re 
stored ; but the doctors at the hospital thought it 
doubtful." 

Mrs. Laird shook her head in a slow fashion, as 
if it was certainty rather than doubt. Helen had 
a sudden impulse to excuse herself, to say that 
Mrs. Otis would come in her stead in the after 
noon. Then she remembered her mother had an 
engagement. In a tone she vainly tried to render 
steady, she asked the name of the unfortunate girl. 

" Fay Western is what she was registered at 



 

the hospital. Her company, I believe, were on 
the eve of going abroad when the accident oc 
curred, and have gone now, but this provision was 
made for her. She is so young, too not much 
beyond twenty. What will you do read aloud 
for the next hour ? This room is very much in 
terested in one of the new novels. You cannot 
hold their attention by anything else." 

" Yes, I will read." She looked curiously 
toward Miss Western. Was there any other simi 
larity except that Bessie Palmer was an actress in 
her fashion ? But Fay Western was not her stage 
name. 

The girl turned her chair slightly, when Helen 
had fairly begun. The eyes seemed to wander 
in her direction, and an intent expression clouded 
the face still red and discolored, and Helen had 
a presentiment that sent a shiver through every 
pulse, a protest she could not understand. Some 
occult power seemed to impel her to watch. She 
was not easily tired, and read on to the end. Her 
listeners drew a long breath of satisfaction, and at 
once there was a flood of exclamations, approval 
and criticisms. The girl in the corner with her 
slow-moving eyes said nothing, but peered curi 
ously at the reader. She shook off the nurse's 
hand, laid lightly on her arm, and made her way 
over to the visitor as the dinner bell sounded. 



Helen Otis gave a gasp. With all the disfigure 
ment there were traces of Bessie Deane. 

" You don't know me ! Am I so horribly 
changed ? I recognized your voice. I " 

" You are Bessie Deane ; at least, you were 
when I knew you." 

" And I'm so solitary now, I'm glad to see 
any one. I want to ask you ever so many 
things." 

" After dinner, then," returned Helen, gravely. 

Bessie scarcely ate anything. Helen was down 
at the foot of the table, and felt Bessie's vain 
efforts to single her out. 

" Then you know this Miss Western ? " said 
the nurse later on. " She is eager to see you 
alone, and is waiting in the reception-room." 
Thither went Helen, with a strange feeling of 
repugnance. Oh, why had fate sent her here 
just at this juncture ? If only she had remained 
in ignorance ! 

Bessie put out her hand. That was scarred as 
well, and two fingers badly drawn. " I thought 
at first that I didn't want any one to know," 
she began " any one at Westhorpe, I mean. 
The doctors said that after a little I wouldn't 
be scarred much. Do you think it will all go 
away ? I had such a beautiful skin, you remem 
ber," and she sighed. " My hair is growing ; 



 



does it look as if it would be golden as before ? 
It was horrible, and all to be done in a mo 
ment!" 

" How did it happen ? " Helen's tone was 
unconsciously strained, and she felt a shrinking 
in every nerve. She could not suddenly assume 
a tenderness, though she pitied her profoundly. 

" I was all dressed in gauze for my part. It 
was just elegant, and I had made a success with 
the dance. I was to go to London with a new 
company. It would have been splendid," and 
Bessie began to cry. 

" My poor child ! " Helen was moved in spite 
of her aversion. 

" We were all in the green room. It was at 
L - , and there were lamps on one dressing- 
table. How it happened no one quite knew, 
but I am sure it was the fault of that nasty, 
clumsy pug that belonged to the star. The 
table tipped over, and the blaze flashed up in 
my face, and all was in confusion. Some one 
covered me, but the heat and smoke oh, it 
was horrible ! That was what hurt my eyes. 
The burns were not so deep, and everything 
was done right away. I was partly unconscious, 
and they said at first it wouldn't be very bad." 
Her lips quivered pitifully and she began to 
cry again, but it was simply bewailing her lost 




prettiness. "They had to go away without me. 
It was such a splendid company, and I wanted 
to go abroad. I had been a real success, and 
Violet Fair was ever so jealous after a while ; 
but her husband ran away with Rose O'Mara, 
and then she made much of me again. She's 
in the new company. Oh, don't you think I 
will be able to go back ? I should want to die 
if I could not." 

Helen was silent. There was no apparent 
promise. 

"I've been here a week. I'm about well, now, 
and when the redness gets out of my skin 
does it look very bad ? You know I can't see
