After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose — and 
the whole house with him — and drank from a portly 
golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth; from 
her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed 
the general assemblage. So the banquet began. 

By midnight the revehy was at its height. Now 
came one of those picttiresque spectacles so admired 
in that old day. A description of it is still extant 
in the quaint wording of a chronicler who wit- 
nessed it; 

“Space being made, presently entered a baron 
and an earl appareled after the Turkish fashion in 
long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on 
their heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of 
gold, girded with two swords, called simitars, hang- 
ing by great bawdricks of gold. Next came yet 
another baron and another earl, in two long gowns 
of yellow satin, traversed with white satin, and in 
every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin, 
after the fashion of Russia, wdth furred hats of gray 
on their heads; either of them having an hatchet in 
their hands, and boots with pykes” (points a foot 
long), “turned up. And after them came a knight, 
then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five 
nobles, in doublets of crimson velvet, voyded low 
on the back and before to the cannel-bone, laced 
on the breasts with chains of silver; and, over that, 
short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads 
hats after the dancers' fashion, with pheasants’ 
feather in them. These were appareled after the 
fashion of Prussia. The torch-bearers, which were 
about an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin 
and green, like Moors, their faces black. Next 
came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which 
were disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies 
did wildly dance also, that it was a pleasure to 
behold.” 

And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing up 

this “wild” dancing, lost in adnairation of the 
commingling of kaleidoscopic colors which 
the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him pre- 
sented, the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was 
proclaiming his rights and his wrongs, denotmcing 
the impostor, and clamoring for admission at the 
gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode 
prodigiously, and pressed forward and craned their 
necks to see the small rioter. Presently they began 
to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad 
tiim into a higher and still more entertaining fury. 
Tears of mortification sprung to his eyes, but he 
stood his ground and defied the mob right royally. 
Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, 
and he exclaimed: 

“I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, 'I 
am the Prince of Wales! And all forlorn and friendless 
as I be, with none to give me word of grace or 
help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from 
my ground, but will maintain it!” 

“Though thou be prince or no prince, ’tis all one, 
thou be’st a gallant lad, and not friendless neither! 
Here stand I by thy side to prove it; and mind I 
tell thee thou might’s! have a worser friend than 
Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. 
Rest thy small jaw, my child, I talk the language of 
these base kennel-rats like to a very native.” 

The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in 
dress, aspect, and bearing. He was tall, trim-built, 
muscular. His doublet and trunks were of rich 
material, but faded and threadbare, and their goldlace 
adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was 


rumpled and damaged; the plume in his slouched 
hat was broken and had a bedraggled and disrepu- 
table look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a 
rusty iron sheath; his swaggering carriage marked 
him at once as a ruffler of the camp. The speech 
of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion
of jeers and laughter. Some cried, “’Tis 
another prince in disguise!” “’Ware thy tongue, 
friend, belike he is dangerous!” “Marry, he looketh 
it — mark his eye!” “Pluck the lad from him — to 
the horse-pond wi’ the cub!” 

Instantly a hand was laid upon the prince, under 
the impulse of this happy thought; as instantly the 
stranger’s long sword was out and the meddler went 
to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of 
it. The next moment a score of voices shouted 
“Eill the dog! kill him! km him!” and the mob 
closed in on the warrior, who backed himself against 
a wall and began to lay about him with his long 
weapon like a madman. His victims sprawled this 
way and that, but the mob-tide poured over their 
prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion 
with undiminished fury. His moments seemed 
numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a 
trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, “Way for 
the king’s messenger!” and a troop of horsemen 
came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of 
harm’s reach as fast as their legs could carry them. 
The bold stranger caught up the prince in his arms, 
and was soon far away from danger and the multitude. 

Retiun we within the Guildhall. Suddenly, high 


above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel, 
broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. There was 
instant silence — a deep hush; then a single voice 
rose — that of the messenger from the palace — and 
began to pipe forth a proclamation, the whole 
multitude standing, listening. The closing words, 
solemnly pronounced, were; 

“The king is dead!” 

The great assemblage bent their heads upon their 
breasts with one accord; remained so, in profound 
silence, a few moments; then all sunk upon their 
knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward 
Tom, and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to 
shake the building: 

“Long live the king!” 

Poor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this 
stupefying spectacle, and finally rested dreamily 
upon the kneeling princesses beside him a moment, 
then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden ptirpose 
dawned in his face. He said, in a low tone, at Lord 
Hertford’s ear: 

“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honor! 
Uttered I here a command, the which none but a 
king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter, 
would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise 
up to say me nay?” 

“None, my liege, in all these realms. In thy 
person bides the majesty of England. Thou art the 
king — thy word is law.” 

Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and 
with great animation; 

“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from 
this day, and never more be law of blood! Up 
from thy knees and away! To the Tower and say 
the king decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”  
The words were caught up and carried eagerly 
from lip to Hp far and wide over the hall, and as 
Hertford hurried from the presence, another pro- 
digious shout burst forth; 

“The reign of blood is ended! Long live Edward 
king of England!” 


CHAPTER XII 

AS soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince 
were clear of the mob, they struck down 
through back lanes and alleys toward the river. 
Their way was unobstructed until they approached 
London Bridge; then they plowed into the multitude 
again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the prince’s 
—no, the king’s— wrist. The tremendous news 
was already abroad, and the boy learned it from a 
thousand voices at once — “The king is dead!” 
The tidings struck a ctdll to the heart of the poor 
little waif, and sent a shudder through his frame. 
He realized the greatness of his loss, and was filled 
with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who had 
been such a terror to others had always been gentle 
with him. The tears sprung to his eyes and blurred 
all objects. For an instant he felt himself the most 
forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s creatures — 
then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching 
thunders; “Long live King Edward the Sixth!” 
and this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with 
pride to his fingers’ ends. “Ah,” he thought, 
“how grand and strange it seems — am king!” 

Our friends threaded theh way slowly through the 
throngs upon the Bridge. This structure, which had 
stood for six hundred years, and had been a noisy 
and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious 
affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and 
shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along 
both sides of it, from one bank of the river to the 
other. The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it 
had its inn, its beerhouses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries,
