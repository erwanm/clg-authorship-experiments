"Did they give it to you?"

"Yes.  And more to stay here.  But this is the first bit of dishonest
work I ever did."

"Well, remember what I have said.  Another misstep and I'll make an end
to you.  Don't think I'm trying to scare you.  You have witnessed
enough to know that it's life and death in this house.  Now run along."

At the garden Jim and Florence sauntered among the crowd, not having
any particular objective point in view.

"Sh!" whispered Jim.

"What is it?"

"Olga Perigoff is yonder in a box."

"Very well; let us go and sit with her.  Is she alone?"

"Apparently.  But don't you think we'd better go elsewhere?"

"My dear young man," said Florence with mock loftiness, "Olga Perigoff
has written me down as a simple young fool, and that is why, sooner or
later, I'm going to put the shoe on the other foot.  You and Jones have
coddled me long enough.  Inasmuch as I am the stake they are playing
for, I intend to have something more than a speaking part in the play."

"All right; you're the admiral," he said with pretended lightness.

So the two of them joined their subtle enemy, conscious of a tingle of
zest as they did so.  On her part, the countess was always suspicious
of this sleepy-eyed reporter.  She never could tell how much he knew.
But of Florence she was reasonably certain; and so long as she could
fool the pretty infant the suspicions of the reporter were a negligible
quantity.  She greeted them effusively and offered them chairs.  For
half an hour they sat there, chatting inanities, all the while each
mind was busy with deeper concerns.

When the man in search of Florence eventually arrived and asked the
manager of the garden if he knew Miss Hargreave by sight the manager
pointed toward the box.  The man wound his way in and out of the idlers
and by the time he reached the box Jim and Florence had made their
departure.  The man bowed, approached, and asked the countess if she
was Miss Hargreave.  For a moment Olga suspected a trap.  Then it
appealed to her mind that if there was no trap it might be well to pose
as Florence, if only to learn what the outcome might be.

"Yes.  What is wanted?" she asked.

The man took a letter from his pocket and handed it to Olga, saying:
"Give this to your father.  He knows how to read it."



Before she could reply the man had turned and was hurrying away.

Olga opened the note, her heart beating furiously.  It was utterly
blank.  At first she thought it was a hoax.  Then she happened to
remember that there was such a thing as invisible ink.  At last!
Hargreave was alive; this letter settled all doubt in her mind on this
question.  Alive!  And not only that, but the girl and Jones were
evidently in communication with him.  She summoned a waiter, made a
secret sign, and he bowed and approached.  She slipped the letter into
his hand and whispered: "Show that at the cave to-morrow.  It is in
invisible ink and meant for Hargreave."

"He's alive?"

"Positively."

"Very well."  The waiter bowed and strolled away nonchalantly.

Braine was in Boston over night, otherwise the countess would have
taken the mysterious note at once to him.  She remained for perhaps a
quarter of an hour longer and then left the garden.  She would have
taken the letter to her own apartment but for the fact that the
chemicals needed were hidden in the cave.

Now it happened that Florence went out for her early ride the next
morning, and crossing a field she saw a man with a bundle under his
arm.  The sun struck his profile and limned it plainly, and Florence
uttered a low cry.  The man had not observed her.  So, very quietly,
she slipped from the horse, tethered it to a tree, and started after
the man to learn what he was doing so far from the city.  She would
never forget that face.  She had seen it that dreadful night when the
note had lured her into the hands of her enemies.  The face belonged to
the man who had impersonated her father.

It occurred to her that she might just as well do a little detective
work on her own hook.  She had passed through so many terrifying
episodes that she was beginning to crave for the excitement, strange as
this may seem.  Like a gambler who has once played for high stakes, she
no longer found pleasure in thimbles and needles and pins.  She
followed the man with no little skill and at length she saw him
approach a knoll, stoop, apparently press a spring, and a hole suddenly
yawned.  The man vanished quickly, and the spot took on again its
virginal appearance.  A cave.  Florence had the patience to wait.  By
and by the man appeared again and slunk away.

When she was sure that he was beyond range, she came out from the place
of concealment, crept up the knoll, and searched about for the magic
handle of this strange door.  Diligence rewarded her, and she soon
found herself in a large, musty, earth-smelling cave.  Loot was
scattered about, and there were boxes and chairs and a large chest.
Men evidently met here, possibly after some desperate adventure against
society.  She found nothing to reward her hardihood, and as she was in
the act of moving toward the cave's door she beheld with terror that it
was moving!



She was near the chest at that moment.  The cave was not a deep one.
There was no tunnel, only a wall.  Resolutely she raised the lid of the
chest, stepped inside, and drew the lid down.  She was just in time.
The door opened and three men entered, talking volubly.  They felt
perfectly secure in talking as loudly as they pleased.  To Florence it
seemed almost impossible that they did not hear the thunder of her
heart?  Strain her ears as she might, she could gather but little of
what they said, except:

"If Hargreave had this paper we might all be put on the defensive.  To
an outsider it is a blank paper.  But the boss will be able to read
it...."  The speaker moved away from the vicinity of the chest and she
heard no more.

Very deftly Florence raised the lid just enough to peep out.  The man
who had been talking was putting the note in his hip pocket.  As he
turned toward the chest he sat down on the soap-box immediately in
front of the chest.  An inspiration came to the girl, an exceedingly
daring one.  She took her liberty in her hands as she executed the
deed.  But the dimness of the cave aided her.  When she crouched down
again the magic paper was hers.

It seemed hours to her before the men left the cave.  As she heard the
hidden door jar in closing she raised the lid and stepped out,
breathing deeply.  The paper she had purloined was indeed blank, but
Jones or Jim would know what to do with it.  And wouldn't they be
surprised when she told them what she had accomplished all alone?  Her
exultation was of short duration.  She heard the whine of the door on
its hinges.  The men were returning.  Why?

They were returning because they had discovered a woman's shoeprint
outside.  It pointed toward the cave, freshly, and there was none
coming away.  To re-enter the chest would be foolhardy.  It would be
the first place the men would look.  She glanced about desperately.
She saw but one chance, the well.  And even while the door was swinging
inward, letting the brilliant sunshine enter, she summoned up the
courage and let herself down into the well, which proved to be nothing
more nor less than an underground river!

The men came in with a rush.  They upset boxes, looked into the chest,
and the man who was evidently in command, gazed down the well, shaking
his head.  Their search was thorough, but they found no one.  And at
length they began to reason that perhaps a woman had got as far as the
door and then turned away, walking on the turf.

Meantime Florence was borne along by the swift current of the river,
which gained in swiftness every moment.  From time to time she bumped
along the rocky walls, but she clung to life valiantly.  In ten minutes
she was swept to the other side of the hill, into the rapids; but the
blue sky was overhead, she was out in the familiar world again.  On, on
she was carried.  Even though she was half dead, she could hear the
roar of a falls somewhere in advance.


Braine thought he really had a clue to the treasure, and with his usual
promptness he set about to learn if it was worth anything.  He procured
a launch and began to prowl about, using a pole as a feeler.  All the
while he was being closely watched by Norton, who had concluded to hang
on to Braine's trail till he found something worthy of note.  Braine
was disguised, but this time Jim was not to be fooled.  But what was he
looking for, wondered the reporter?  Braine continued to pole along,
sometimes pausing to look over the gunwale down into the water.  In
raising his head after the last investigation, he discerned something
struggling in the water, about three hundred yards away.  The current
leisurely brought the object into full view.  It was a young woman with
just power enough to keep herself afloat.  The golden head roused
something in him stronger than curiosity.  It might be!

Braine proceeded to move the launch in the direction of the girl.  It
was this movement that turned the reporter's gaze.  He, too, now saw
the woman in the water and wondered how she had come there.  When
Braine reached the girl and pulled her into the launch Jim saw her face
plainly.



He flew from his vantage point, found a skiff and started after Braine.

"By the Lord Harry!" murmured the rogue.  "Well, they can talk of manna
from heaven, but this is what I call luck.  Florence Hargreave, out of
nowhere, into my arms!  The god of luck has cast another horseshoe and
it's mine."

He had a flask in his pocket, and he forced some of the biting spirits
down the girl's throat.  She opened her eyes.

"Well, my beauty?"
