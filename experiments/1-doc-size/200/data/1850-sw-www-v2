them if there was any places wanted mending." 

" I am afraid I don't know how to manage that," said 
Ellen very gravely. — " There is one thing I can do, — I can 
darn stockings very nicely ; but that's only one kind of mend- 
ing. I don't know much about the other kinds." 

" Ah well, but she did, however," said Margery, searching 
in her basket of clothes for some particular pieces. " A beautiful mender she was to be sure ! Look here. Miss Ellen, 
— just see that patch — the way it is put on — so evenly by a 
thread all round ; and the stitches, see — and see the way this 
rent is darned down ; — oh that was the way she did every- 
thing !" 







" I can't do it so," said Ellen sighing, — " But I can learn ; — 
that I can do. You will teach me Margery, won't you ?" 

" Indeed Miss Ellen, dear, it's more than I can myself ; 
but I will tell you who will ; and that's Mrs. Vawse. I am 
thinking it was her she learned of in the first place, — but I 
aint certain. Anyhow she's a first-rate hand." 

" Then I'll get her to teach me," said Ellen ; — " that will 
do very nicely. And now Margery, what else ?" 

" dear, Miss Ellen, — I don't know, — there was a thou- 
sand little things that I'd only recollect at the minute ; she'd 
set the table for me when my hands was uncommon full ; and 
often she'd come out and make some little thing for the master when I wouldn't have the time to do the same myself ; — 
and i can't tell — one can't think of those things but just at 
the minute. Dear Miss Ellen, I'd be sorry indeed to see you 
a trying your little hands to do all that she done." 

" Never mind Margery," said Ellen, " and she threw her 
arms round the kind old woman as she spoke, — "I won't 
trouble you — and you won't be troubled if I am awkward 
about anything at first, will you ?" 

Margery could only throw down her holder to return most 
affectionately as well as respectfully Ellen's caress and press 
a very hearty kiss upon her forehead. 

Ellen next went to Mrs. Vawse to beg her help in the 
mending and patching line. Her old friend was very glad to 
see her take up anything with interest, and readily agreed to 
do her best in the matter. So some old clothes were looked 
up ; pieces of hnen, cotton, and flannel gathered together ; a 
large basket found to hold all these rags of shape and no 
shape ; and for the next week or two Ellen was indefatigable. 
She would sit making vain endeavors to arrange a large linen 
patch properly, till her cheeks were burning with excitement ; 
and bend over a darn, doing her best to take invisible stitches, 
till Mrs. Vawse was. obliged to assure her it was quite unnecessary to take so much pains. Taking pains, however, is 
the sure way to success. Ellen could not rest satisfied till 
she had equalled Alice's patching and darning ; and though 
when Mrs. Vawse left her she had not quite reached that 
point, she was bidding fair to do so in a little while. 

In other things she was more at home. She could skim 
milk well enough, and immediately began to do it for Margery. She at once also took upon herself the care of the 
parlor cupboard and all the things in it, which she well knew 
had been Alice's office ; and thanks to Miss Fortune's training, 
even Margery was quite satisfied with her neat and orderly 
manner of doing it. Ellen begged her when the clothes came 
up from the wash, to show her where everything went, so 
^hat for the future she miglit be able to put them away ; and 
she studied the shelves of the linen closet, and the chests of 
drawers in Mr. Humphreys' room, till she almost knew them 
by heart. As to the library, she dared not venture. Slie 
law Mr. Humphreys at meals and at prayers, — only then. 
He had never asked her to come into his study since the 
night she sang to him, and as for her asking — nothing could 
have been more impossible. Even when he was out of the 
house, out by the hour, Ellen never thought of ffoino- where 
she had not been expressly permitted to go. 

When Mr. Van runt informed his wife of Ellen's purpose 
to desert her service and make her future home at the parsonage, the lady's astonishment was only less than her indignation ; the latter not at all lessened by learning that Ellen 
was to become the adopted child of the house. For a while 
her words of displeasure were poured forth in a torrent ; Mr. 
Van Brunt meantime saying very little, and standing by like a 
steadfast rock that the waves dash past, not vpon. She declared this was " the cap-sheaf of Miss Humphreys' doings ; 
she mi(jht have been wise enough to have expected as much ; 
she wouldn't haye been such a fool if she had ! This was what 
she had let Ellen go there for ! a pretty return !'' But she 
went on. " She wondered who they thought they had to 
deal with ; did they think she was going to let Ellen go in 
that way ? she had the first and only rigiit to her ; and Ellen 
had no more business to go and give herself away than one 
of her oxen ; they would find it out, she guessed, pretty 
quick ; Mr. John and all ; she'd have her back in no time !" 
What were her thoughts and feelings, when after having 
spent her breath she found her husband quietly opposed to this 
conclusion, words cannot tell. Her words could not ; she 
was absolutely dumb, till he had said his say ; and then, 
nppalled by the serenity of his manner she left indignation on 
one side for the present and began to argue the matter. But 
Mr. Van Brunt coolly said he had promised ; she might get 







as many help as she Hked, he would pay for them and welcome ; but Ellen would have to stay where she was. He 
had promised Miss Alice ; and he wouldn't break his word 
" for kings, lords, and commons." A most extraordinary 
expletive for a good republican, — which Mr. Van Brunt had 
probably inherited from his father and grandfather. What 
can waves do against a rock ? The whilome Miss Fortune 
disdained a struggle which must end in her own confusion, 
and wisely kept her chagrin to herself ; never even approaching the subject afterwards, with him or any other person. 
Ellen had left the whole matter to Mr. Van Brunt, expecting 
a storm and not wishing to share it. Happily it all blew 
over. 

As the month drew to an end, and indeed long before, 
Ellen's thoughts began to go forward eagerly to John's coming home. She had learned by this time how to mend 
clothes ; she had grown somewhat wonted to her new round 
of little household duties ; in everything else the want of him 
was felt. Study flagged ; though knowing what his wish 
would be, and what her duty was, she faithfully tried to go 
on with it. She had no heart for riding or walking by herself. She was lonely ; she was sorrowful ; she was weary ; 
all Mrs. Vawse's pleasant society was not worth the mere 
knowledge that he was in the house ; she longed for his 
coming. 

He had written what day they might expect him. But 
when it came Ellen tound that her feeling had changed ; it 
did not look the bright day she had expected it would. Up 
to that time she had thought only of herself ; now she remembered what sort of a coming home this must be to him ; and 
she dreaded almost as much as she wished for the moment 
of his arrival. Mrs. Vawse was surprised to see that her face 
was sadder that day than it had been for many past ; she 
could not understand it. Ellen did not explain. It was late 
in the day before he reached home, and her anxious watch of 
hope and fear for the sound of his horse's feet grew very 
painful. She busied herself with setting the tea-table ; it was 
all done ; and she could by no means do anything else. She 
could not go to the door to listen there ; she remembered too 
well the last time ; and she knew he would remember it. 







He came at last. Ellen's feeling had judged rightly of his, 
for the greeting was without a word on either side ; and when 
he left the room to go to his father, it was very very long 
before h% came back. And it seemed to Ellen for several 
days that he was more grave and talked less than even the 
last time he had been at home. She was sorry when Mrs. 
Vawse proposed to leave them. But the old lady wisely 
said they would all feel better when she was gone ; and it 
was so. Truly as she was respected and esteemed, on all 
sides, it was felt a relief by every one of the family when she 
went back to her mountain-top. They were left to themselves ; they saw what their numbers were ; there was no 
restraint upon looks, words, or silence. Ellen saw at once 
that the gentlemen felt easier, that was enough to make her 
so. The extreme oppression that had grieved and disap- 
pointed her the first few days after John's return, gave place 
to a softened gravity ; and the household fell again into all 
its old ways ; only that upon every brow there was a 
chastened air of sorrow, in everything that was said a tone of 
remembrance, and that a little figure was going about where 
Alice's used to move as mistress of the house. 

Thanks to her brother, that little fioure was an exceedingly
busy one. She had in the first place her household duties, 
in discharging which she was perfectly untiring. From the 
cream skimmed for Margery, and the cups of coffee poured 
out every morning for Mr. Humphreys and her brother, to the 
famous mending which took up often one half of Saturday, 
whatever she did was done with her best diligence and care ; 
and from love to both the dead and the living, Ellen's zeal 
never slackened. These things however filled but a small 
part of her time, let her be as particular as she would ; and 
Mr. John effectually hindered her from being too particular. 
He soon found a plenty for both her and himself to do. 

Not that they ever forgot or tried to forget Alice ; on the 
contrary. They sought to remember her, humbly, calmly, 
hopefully, thankfully ! By diligent performance of duty, by 
Christian faith, by conversation and prayer, they strove to 
do this ; and after a time succeeded. Sober that winter 
was, but it was very far from being an unhappy one. 

" John," said Ellen one day, some time after Mrs. Vawse
