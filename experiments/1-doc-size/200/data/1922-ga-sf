"Glad to see you looking so well. I've 
wanted to call for a long time, but as you 
dropped us all like so many hot potatoes, I 
hesitated, and was delighted today when 
Howard gave me an excuse.'' 

" Howard?" 

" Yes, he wants you to go back to him." 

" That I'll never do." 

" Don't be hasty. He is willing to forget 
everything — he asked me to make you understand that he would never mention the subject. 
He will also put your share of your father's 
estate unreservedly in your hands as soon as the 
usual legal delays are over. You knew that 
your father was dead, did you not? And your 
mother also?" 

" Oh yes, I knew. It didn't seem to make 
any difference. I knew I never should see them 
again anyhow." 

" Howard was appointed trustee of your inheritance, but as I said, he does not mean to take 
advantage of the fact. I am informed, by the 
way, that your brother never told your parents 
that you had left Howard. He knew nothing 
beyond the fact, of course." 

« Well, I am glad of that." 

She had no intention of shedding any tears 
before Mr. McLane. Let him think her callous 
if he must. 

"About Howard?" 

" I'll never go back to him. I never want 
to see him again." 

"Not if he would take you to Europe to live? 
There is ^n opening for an American doctor in 
Paris." 

" I never want to see him again. I know he 



 

is a good man but I hate him. And if I did go
back it would be worse. You may tell him 
that.'' 

" Is your decision irrevocable?" 

" Yes, it is.'' 

" Then I must tell you that if there is no 
prospect of your return he will divorce you." 

"Divorced — I divorced?" Her eyes expanded with horrified astonishment. But only 
for a moment. She threw bade her head and 
laughed. "That was funny, wasn't it? Well, 
let him do as he thinks best. And he may be 
happy once more if I am out of his life altogether. He won't have much trouble getting 
a divorce!" 

" He will obtain it on the ground of desertion." 

"Oh! Well, he was always a very good 
man. Poor Howard! I hope he'll marry 
again and be happy." 

" Better think it over. I — by the way — 
I'm not sure the women wouldn't come round in 
time} particularly if you lived abroad for a 
few years." 

She curled her lip. " And I should have my 
precious position in Society again! How much 



 

do you suppose that means to me? Have the 
fatted calf killed and coals of fire poured on 
my humbled head! Do you think I have no 
pride?" 

"You appear to have regained it. I wish 
you could regain the rest and be the radiant 
creature you were when you came to us. God! 
What a lovely stunning creature you were! It 
hurts me like the devil, I can tell you. And 
it's hurt the women too. They were fond of 
you. Do you know that Sally is dead?" 

" Yes. She had everjrthing to live for and 
she died. Life seems to amuse herself with 
us.'' 

" She's a damned old hag." He rose and 
took up his hat and cane. " Well, I'll wait a 
week, and then if you don't relent the proceedings will begin. I shan't get the divorce. Not 
my line. But he asked me to talk to you and I 
was glad to come. Good-by." 

She smiled as she shook hands with him. As 
he opened the door he turned to her again. 

" That young Holt is a good fellow and has 
a head on his shoulders. Better be guided by 
him if he offers you any advice." 



XXXIX 

ALMOST insensibly and without comment 
Madeleine fell into the habit of sleeping 
at night and going abroad with Holt in the day- 
time. Nor did he take her to any more dives. 
They went across the Bay, either to Oakland 
or Sausalito, and took long walks, dining at 
some inn where they were sure to meet no one 
they knew. She had asked hiiti to buy her 
books, as she did not care to venture either into 
the bookstores or the Mercantile Library. She 
now had a part of her new income to spend as 
she chose, and moved into more comfortable 
rooms, although far from the fashionable 
quarter. She was restless and often very 
nervous but Holt knew that she drank no 
longer. There had been another revolution of 
the wheel : she would have a large income, freedom impended, the future was hers to dispose 
of at will. Her health was excellent  she had 
regained her old proud bearing. 

"What are you going to do with it?" he 





 

asked her abruptly one evening. They were 
sitting in the arbor of a restaurant on the water 
front at Sausalito and had just finished dinner. 
The steep promontory rose behind them a wild 
forest of oak and pine, madrona and chaparral. 
Across the sparkling dark green water San 
Francisco looked a pale blue in the twilight and 
there was a banner of soft pink above her. 
Lights were appearing on the military islands, 
the ferry boats, and yachts. " You will be free 
in about a month now. Have you made any 
plans? You will not stay here, of course." 

" Stay here ! I shall leave the day the decree 
is granted, and Pll never see California again 
as long as I live." 

" But where shall you go?'' 

" Oh — it would be interesting to live in 
Europe." 

" Whether you have admitted it to yourself 
or not you have not the remotest idea of going 
to Europe." 

"Oh?" 

" You are going to Langdon Masters. Nothing in the world could keep you away from 
him — or should." 

" I wish women smoked. You look so placid. 
And I am glad you smoke cigarettes." 



 

"Why not try one?" 

" Oh, no! " She looked scandalized. " I 
never did that — before. The other was for 
a purpose, not because I liked it." 

" I am used to your line of ratiocination. But 
you haven't answered my question." 

" Did you ask one?" 

" In the form of an assertion, yes."
