San Giacinto left the room. When he was gone, Sara 
cinesca stood still for a moment, and then sank into a chair. 
His strong nature had sustained him through the meeting 
and would sustain him to the end, but he was terribly shaken, 
and felt a strange sensation of numbness in the back of his 
head, which was quite new to him. For some minutes he 
sat still as though dazed and only half conscious. Then he 
rose again, shook himself as though to get rid of a bad dream 
and rang the bell. He sent for Giovanni, who appeared 
immediately. 

' San Giacinto has been here,' he said quickly. ' He is 
the man. You had better tell your wife, as she will want 
to collect her things before we leave the house.' 

Giovanni was staggered by his father's impetuosity. He 
had realised that the danger existed, but it had always seemed 
indefinitely far removed, 

' I suppose there will be some legal proceedings before 
everything is settled,' he said with more calmness than he 
felt. 



' What is that to us ? We must go, sooner or later.' 
' And if the courts do not decide in his favour, what then ? ' 
' There is no doubt about it,' answered the prince, pacing 
the room as his excitement returned. 'You and I are 
nobody. We had better go and live in an inn. That man 
is honest. I hate him, but he is honest. Why do you 
stand there staring at me ? Were you not the first to say 
that if we are impostors we should give up everything of our 
own free-will? And now you seem to think that I will 
fight the suit ! That is your logic ! That is all the con 
sistency you have acquired in your travels ! Go and tell 
your wife that you are nobody, that I am nobody ! Go and 
tell her to give you a title, a name for men to call you by ! 
Go into the market and see whether you can find a name 
for your father ! Go and hire a house for us to live in, 
when that Neapolitan devil has brought Flavia Montevarchi 
to live in the palace where your mother died, where you 
were born poor Giovanni ? Not that I pity you any more 
than I pity myself Why should I ? You are young and 
have done this house the honour to spend most of your life 
out of it. But after all poor Giovanni ! ' 

Saracinesca seized his son's hand and looked into his 
eyes. The young man's face was perfectly calm, almost 
serene in its expression of indifference to misfortune. His 
whole soul was preoccupied by greater and nobler emotions 
than any which could be caused by worldly loss. He had 
been with Corona again, had talked with her and had seen 
that look in her face which he had learned to dread more 
than he had ever dreaded anything in his life. What was 
life itself without that which her eyes refused ? 



CHAPTER XIX 

PRINCE MONTEVARCHI was very much surprised when he was 
told that Anastase Gouache wished to see him, and as he 
was very much occupied with the details of the suit his first 
impulse was to decline the visit. Although he had no idea 
that matters had already gone so far between the Zouave and 



 

Faustina, he was not, however, so blind as the young girl 
had supposed him to be. He was naturally observant, like 
most men who devote their lives to the pursuit of their own 
interests, and it had not escaped him that Faustina and 
Gouache were very often to be seen talking together in 
the world. Had he possessed a sense of humour he might 
possibly have thought that it would be inexpressibly comical 
if Gouache should take it into his head to fall in love with 
the girl ; but the Italians are not a humorous people, and 
the idea did not suggest itself to the old gentleman. He 
consented to receive Gouache because he thought the oppor 
tunity would be a good one for reading the young man 
a lecture upon the humility of his station, and upon the 
arrogance he displayed in devoting himself thus openly to 
the daughter of Casa Montevarchi. 

' Good-day, Monsieur Gouache,' he said solemnly, as 
Anastase entered. ' Pray be seated. To what do I owe the 
honour of your visit ? ' 

Anastase had put on a perfectly new uniform for the 
interview, and his movements were more than usually alert 
and his manners a shade more elaborate and formal than on 
ordinary occasions. He felt and behaved as young men of 
good birth do who are serving their year in the army, and 
who, having put on their smartest tunic, hope that in a half 
light they may be taken for officers. 

' Will you allow me to explain my position in the first 
place?' he asked, seating himself and twisting his cap slowly 
in his hands. 

' Your position ? By all means, if you desire to do so. 
It is an excellent rule in all discourses to put the definition 
before the argument. Nevertheless, if you would inform me 
of the nature of the affair, it might help me to understand 
you. better.' 

' It is very delicate but I will try to be plain. What 
I am, I think you know already. I am a painter and I have 
been successful For the present, I am a Zouave, but my 
military service does not greatly interfere with my profession. 
We have a good deal of time upon our hands. My pictures 
bring me a larger income than I can spend.' 





' I congratulate you,' observed Montevarchi, opening his 
small eyes in some astonishment. ' The pursuit of the fine 
arts is not generally very lucrative. For myself, I confess 
that I am satisfied with those treasures which my father has 
left me. I am very fond of pictures, it is true ; but you 
will understand that, when a gallery is filled, it is full You 
comprehend, I am sure? Much as I might wish to own 
some of the works of the modern French school, the double 
disadvantage of possessing already so many canvases, and 
the still stronger consideration of my limited fortune yes, 
limited, I assure you ' 

' Pardon me,' interrupted Gouache, whose face reddened 
suddenly, 'I had no intention of proposing to sell you a 
picture. I am not in the habit of advertising myself nor of 
soliciting orders for my work.' 

'My dear sir !' exclaimed the prince, seeing that he was 
on a wrong tack, ' have I suggested such a thing ? If my 
words conveyed the idea, pray accept all my excuses. Since 
you had mentioned the subject of art, my thoughts naturally 
were directed to my gallery of pictures. I am delighted to 
hear of your success, for you know how much interest we 
all feel in him who was the victim of such an unfortunate 
accident, due doubtless to the carelessness of my men.' 

' Pray do not recall that ! Your hospitality more than 
repaid me for the little I suffered. The matter concerning 
which I wish to speak to you is a very serious one, and I 
hope you will believe that I have considered it well before 
taking a step which may at first surprise you. To be plain, 
I come to ask you to confer upon me the honour of Donna 
Faustina Montevarchi's hand.' 

Montevarchi leaned back in his chair, speechless with 
amazement. He seemed to gasp for breath as his long fingers 
pressed the green table-cover before him. His small eyes 
were wide open, and his toothless jaw dropped. Gouache 
feared that he was going to be taken ill 

' You ! ' cried the old man in a cracked voice, when he 
had recovered himself enough to be able to speak. 

' Yes,' answered Anastase, who was beginning to feel very 
nervous as he observed the first results of his proposal. He 




had never before quite realised how utterly absurd the match 
would seem to Montevarchi. ' Yes,' he repeated. ' Is the 
idea so surprising ? Is it inconceivable to you that I should 
love your daughter ? Can you not understand ' 

' I understand that you are wholly mad ! ' exclaimed the 
prince, still staring at his visitor in blank astonishment. 

' No, I am not mad. I love Donna Faustina ' 

' You ! You dare to love Faustina ! You, a painter, a 
man with a profession and with nothing but what you earn ! 
You, a Zouave, a man without a name, without ' 

' You are an old man, prince, but the fact of my having 
made you an honourable proposition does not give you the 
right to insult me.' The words were spoken in a sharp, 
determined voice, and brought Montevarchi to his senses. 
He was a terrible coward and would rather go to a consider 
able expense than face an angry man. 

' Insult you, my dear sir ? I would not think of it ! ' he 
answered in a very different tone. ' But my dear Monsieur 
Gouache, I fear that this is quite impossible ! In the first 
place, my daughter's marriage is already arranged. The 
negotiations have been proceeding for some time she is to 
marry Frangipani you must have heard it. And, moreover, 
with all due respect for the position you have gained by 
your immense talent immense, my dear friend, I am the 
first to say it the instability of human affairs obliges me
