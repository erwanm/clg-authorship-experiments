shoulder. “Who is coming? You look as if 
a great anxiety had been lifted.” 

Did she show things so plainly? 

“ There, you needn’t gloom over so quickly. 



I know something has been troubling you, and 
if a friend can’t help she has no right to add 
curiosity to the burden. Don’t you suppose 
I know there are things girls can't tell each 
other because they belong to a third person’s 
confidence? They never trouble me.” 

“ You are a sweet and dear friend. Yes, 
I have had a cause for anxiety, but it is over 
for the present.” 

“ Then come down and help decorate for 
the concert. Oh, I forget — you are in the 
singing! ” 

“ Only in the choruses. There were two 
fine contralto soloists, and I had too much 
other work to do.” 

The seats had been arranged in tiers for 
the audience, the posts had been decorated 
with flags and college colors, the background 
of the stage was a mass of greenery and 
branches of bloom. Girls were putting in 
effective flowers, rich-tinted peonies, pendant 
pink acacias, and yellow laburnum. Helen 
joined eagerly, then she was called to the last 
practice. 

Just at dusk they hung the colored lanterns, 



reserving the white for the edge of the stage. 
It was a veritable fairy-land. Spectators gath- 
ered early and rambled around full of praise 
for the admirable effects. 

Then the singers stole in behind the green- 
ery as noiselessly as if they had been fairies 
dropping into seats, their soft, white gowns 
flowing around them like waves. The con- 
ductor, with her baton, arose. The audience 
studied programmes. There were some grand 
choruses, a Latin hymn from “ Stabat Mater, ’’ 
a soft Sicilian melody, duets and trios, with 
violin and harp accompaniment, and two 
beautiful songs, compositions of the seniors, 
one entitled “ At Dusk,’ the refrain of which 
was full of exquisite melody. There were to 
be no encores, but at the last some special re- 
quests were heeded, and the “ Good Night,’ 
sung over again. 

“ It certainly is the finest concert we have 
had yet! ” declared Miss Van Meter. “ There 
never has been such an excellent musical body 
as this year’s seniors, and I tremble for a 
decadence next year.” 

“ We must endeavor to keep them up to the 


mark. I hope we shall hear a good account 
of our best singers. Miss Van Blascom has 
a fine offer to go abroad as an understudy to 
quite a noted singer, who is to train her. That 
‘ At Dusk ’ was an exquisite little thing. Miss 
Hays can write beautiful music. She always 
‘ weds it to the words, as some one says.” 

The gay throng promenaded round. The 
moon had just come up. One and another 
carried off Helen to see a mother or sister 
or even a father; she was so bright and viva- 
cious, so ready to answer questions and ex- 
plain. 

Then she espied solitary Shirley. She need 
not have been alone, but she was hovering 
about waiting the chance of seeing Helen.- 

“ I wonder if it is wrong and envious to de- 
sire some of these people for your very own? 
The girls seem so proud and happy with their 
parents and friends. I don’t suppose you ever 
longed for any one’s father?” glancing up 
with lustrous eyes, the red lips quivering, the 
hands clasped. 

“ Why, that’s odd.” and Helen drew a long 
breath. “ Yes, the father of my friend who 



died was an ideal parent. Well — the mother 
also.” 

“ You loved your father very much, I sup- 
pose," musingly. 

“We were together such a very little, and 
his life had been spent mostly among men 
students. He did not understand girls at all.” 

“ I’ve been watching that tall man with a 
long white beard. How proud he is of that 
slim girl beside him, and how she loves him. 
Fathers are not all alike," and Shirley sighed. 

“ That's Edna Bradford. She will be in 
next year’s juniors. She has no mother, I 
believe.” 

“ Are many of your friends here? ” 

“ Not one of any standing, outside of col- 
lege, I believe. Most of my friends and all 
my relatives live at such a distance they could 
not come if they wanted to. And they are 
not college people.” 

“ Then we are alike, though you have so 
many friends it is not lonesome for you. I 
do so like some one with whom to enjoy 
things. But I know I couldn’t give much. 
Oh, you have been very kind to me! And 


 

listening to the music, the songs, a thought 
came into my mind — a song it was, and it 
sung itself in my brain. If I could write 
music — ” in a wistful tone. 

“ Take it up next year. Why do I you want 
Greek? ” 

“ Oh, there are so many splendid things in 
it! And I guess my father would be better 
satisfied. But music stirs me so, and that 
‘ Good Night ’ — 

“ ‘ Good night to all sweet tender things 
That haunt the underwold, ’ ” 

she chanted in a soft, untrained voice. “ I 
want to write a beautiful song and set it to 
exquisite music. Then I shall dedicate it to 
you.” 

“Oh, thank you! I shall look for it next 
year. Now I know you will surely come 
back, and I hope we shall have nice times. 
It will seem a good deal better to you.” 

Shirley glanced up with smiling eyes. She 
was a sweet-natured child, and it seemed as 
if she had gone astray among such a host of 
girls. 


“ I shall count on it all the vacation.” 


Was there not a duty here? Was not hap- 
piness a charm to be diffused about, rather 
than gathered in little circles? She slipped 
Shirley's arm through hers and began leading 
her about, introducing her to several. Miss 
Van Blascom passed. 

“Here is an ardent admirer!” exclaimed 
Helen, “ who deeply and entirely appreciated 
the setting you gave that beautiful song,” and 
she introduced Shirley, who glanced up with 
shy hesitation that made her more charming. 

“ Miss Chardavoyne — let me see — ” and 
the tall girl knit her brow in thought. 
“Wasn’t there — oh! I have it, a poem in 
February’s Miscellany. It was brimming over 
with music. Why, you could write songs. It 
is a fine gift to be able to get the lilt, the swing, 
the tenderness, the melody that can be wedded 
to notes. Some day, I may be singing one of 
your songs.” 

“ Then I must write one just for you,” 
Shirley returned simply with charming candor
