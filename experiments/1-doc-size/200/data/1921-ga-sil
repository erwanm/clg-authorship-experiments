Gathbroke, gratefully rested in her brother's room while 
she kept watch on the roof. It was night but the very 
atmosphere seemed ablaze and the dynamiting as well as 
the approaching wall of fire looked very close. Finally 
when sparks fell on the roof she descended hastily and 



 

awakened her guest, making him welcome" to her 
brother's linen as well as to a basin of precious water. 
When he joined her in the kitchen he had even shaved 
himself and she saw that he looked both older and 
younger than Americans of his age; which, he had told 
her, was twenty-three. His fair well-modeled face 
was now composed and his hazel eyes were brilliant and 
steady. He had a tall trim military body, and very 
straight bright brown hair; a rather conventional figure 
of a well-bred Englishman, Gora assumed; intelligent, 
and both more naif and more worldly-wise than young 
Americans of his class; but whose potentialities had 
hardly been apprehended even by himself. 

They ate as substantial a breakfast as could be prepared hastily over a spirit lamp, filled their pockets with 
stale bread, cake, and small tins ot food, and then carried a narrow wire mattress from one of the smaller 
bedrooms to the front room on the first floor. 



CHAPTER X 



'THE patrol had been relieved by another, an older 
 man, and sober. He merely reproved them for disobeying orders, glanced sympathetically at the presumed 
invalid, and directed them to one of the temporary hospitals some blocks farther west. 

Gora, like all imaginative people, had a horror of the 
corpse, and averted her eyes from the head of the dead 
girl outlined under the veil she had thrown over it. 
Gathbroke was obliged to walk backward, and as both 
were extremely uncomfortable, there was no attempt at 
conversation until they reached the gates of the old 
cemetery the great pioneers had called Lone Mountain 
and their more commonplace descendants rechristened 
Laurel Hill. 

The glare of the distant fire illuminated the silent 
city where a thousand refugees slept as heavily as the 



 

dead, and as they ascended the steep path they examined 
anxiously the vaults on either side. Finally Gora exclaimed : 

"There! On the right." 

The iron doors of a once eminent resident's last dwelling had been half twisted from their rusty hinges. 
Gathbroke threw his weight on them and they fell at his 
feet. He and Gora carried in the body and lifted it to 
an empty shelf. 

"Good!" Gora gave a long sigh of relief. "Nothing 
can happen to her now. Even the entrance faces away 
from the fire and there is nothing but grass in the cemetery to burn, anyhow." She held her electric torch to 
the inscription above the entrance. "Better write down 
the name — Eandolph. There's one of the tragedies of 
the sixties for you! An Englishman the hero, by the 
way. Nina Randolph is a handful of dust in there somewhere. Heigho! What's the difference, anyway? Even 
if she'd been happy she'd be dead by this time — or too 
old to have a past." 

Gathbroke replaced the gates, for he feared prowling 
dogs, and they walked down to the street and sat on the 
grass, leaning against the wall of the cemetery, as dissociated as possible from the rows of uneasy sleepers. 





They slept a little between blasts of dynamite, the 
snoring of men and women and cries of children ; finally 
at Gora's suggestion climbed to the steep bare summit of 
Calvary to observe the progress of the fire. 

The unlighted portion of the city beneath them looked 
like a dead planet. Beyond was a tossing sea of flame 
whose far-reaching violent glare seemed to project it 
inimitably. 

"Nothing can stop it!" gasped Gora; and that terrific 
red mass of energy and momentum did look as if its only 
curb would be the Pacific Ocean. 

They talked until morning. He was very frank about 
himself, finding no doubt a profound comfort in human 



 

companionship after those long hours of ghastly communion down in that flaming jungle. 

He was a younger son and in the army, not badly off, 
as his mother made him a goodish allowance. She had 
come of a large manufacturing family in the North and 
had brought a fortune to the empty treasury of the 
young peer she had — happily for both — fallen in love 
with. 

He had wanted to go into business — politics later perhaps — after he left Eton, feeling that he had inherited 
some of the energy of his maternal grandfather, but his 
mother had insisted upon the army and as he reaUy 
didn't care so very much, he had succumbed. 

"But I'm not sure I shan't regret it. It isn't as if 
there were any prospect of a real war. I'd like a fighting career well enough, but not picayune affairs out in 
India or Africa. I can't help thinking I have a talent 
for business. Sounds beastly conceited," he added 
hastily. It was evident that he was a modest youth. 
"But after all one of us should inherit something of the 
sort. Perhaps, later, who knows? At least I can thank 
heaven that I wasn't born in my brother's place. He 
likes politics, and his fate is the House of Lords. A 
man might as well go and embalm himself at once. Do 
you know Gwynne ? Elton Gwynne ? John Gwynne he 
calls himself out here. ' ' 

"I've heard of him. He's been written up a good 
deal. I don't know any one of that sort. " 

"Really? Well, don't you see? he inherited a peer- 
age; grandfather died and his cousin shot himself to 
cover up a scandal. Gwynne was in the full tide of his 
career in the House of Commons and simply couldn't 
stand for it. He cut the whole business and came out 
here where he and his mother had a large estate — Lady 
Victoria's mother or grandmother was a Spanish-Californian. Of course he chucked the title. He 's a sort of 
cousin of mine and I looked him up, and dined with 
him the other night. He was bom in the United States, 
by a fluke as it were, and has made up his mind to be an 
American for the rest of his life and carve out a political 
career in this country. I'd have done the same thing, 



 

by Jove! First-class solution . . . although it's a pretty 
hard wrench to give up your own country. But when a 
man is too active to stagnate — there you are. ... I wish 
I had known where to find him to-day, but he lives on 
his ranch and I 've only seen him once since. Lady Victoria took me to a ball night before last — Good God! 
Was it only that? . . . and we were to have met again 
for lunch to-day." 

"It is very easy and picturesque to renounce when 
you possess just about everything in life! If I attempted to renounce any of my privileges, for instance- 
I should simply move down and out." 





He turned his head and regarded her squarely for the 
first time. Heretofore she had been simply a friend in 
need, a jolly good sport, incidentally a female. If she 
had been beautiful he should have noted that fact at 
once, for he could not imagine the circumstances in which 
beauty would not exert an immediate and powerful influence, however transitory. 

Miss Dwight was not beautiful, but he concluded during that frank stare that her face was interesting; disturbingly so, although he was unable at the moment to 
find the reason. It was possible that in favorable conditions she would be handsome. 

She had a mass of dark brown hair that seemed to 
sink heavily over her low forehead until it almost met 
the heavy black eyebrows. She had removed her hat 
and the thick loose coils made her look topheavy; for 
the face, if wide across the high cheek-bones and sharply 
accentuated with a salient jaw, was not large. The eyes 
were a light cold gray, oval and far apart. Her nose 
was short and strong and had the same cohibitive expression as the straight sharply-cut mouth — when not 
ironic or smiling. Her teeth were beautiful. 

She had put on her best tailored' suit and he saw that 
her "figger" was good although too short and full for 
his taste. He liked the long and stately slenderness 
that his own centuries had bred. But her hands and 



 

well-shod feet were narrow if not small, and he decided 
that she just escaped possessing what modern slang so 
aptly expressed as "class." Possibly it was the defiance 
in her square chin, the almost angry poise of her head,
