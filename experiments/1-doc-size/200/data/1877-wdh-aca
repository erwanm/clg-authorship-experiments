Constance, in abject despair: "Well, then I 
go back to what I always knew; I was too 
slight, too foolish, too tiresome for his life-long 
love. He saw it in time, I don't blame him. 
You would see it, too." 

Bartlett : " What devil's vantage enabled that 
infernal scoundrel to blight your spirit with his 
treason ? Constance, is this my last answer ? " 

Constance : " Yes, go ! I am so sorry for you, 

sorrier than I ever thought I could be for 
anything again." 

Bartlett: "Then if you pity me, give me a 
little hope that sometime, somehow " 

Constance: " Oh, I have no hope, for you, for me. 
for any one. Good-by, good, kind friend ! Try, 

you won't have to try hard to forget me. 
Unless some miracle should happen to show me 
that it was all his fault and none of mine, we are 
parting now forever. It has been a strange 
dream, and nothing is so strange as that it should 
be ending so. Are you the ghost or I, I wonder ! 
It confuses me as it did at first; but if you are 
he, or only you Ah, don't look at me so, or 



 

I must believe he has never left me, and implore 
you to stay ! " 

Bartlettj quietly : " Thanks. I would not stay 
a moment longer in his disguise, if you begged 
me on your knees. I shall always love you, 
Constance, but if the world is wide enough, please 
Heaven, I will never see you again. There are 
some things dearer to me than your, presence. 
No, I won't take your hand ; it can't heal the 
hurt your words have made, and nothing can 
help me, now I know from your own lips that 
but for my likeness to him I should never have 
been anything to you. Good-by ! " 

Constance : " Oh ! " She sinks with a long 
cry into the arm-chair beside the table, and drops 
her head into her arms upon it. At the door 
toward which he turns Bartlett meets General 
Wyatt, and a moment later Mrs. Wyatt enters by 
the other. Bartlett recoils under the concen- 
trated reproach and inquiry of their gaze. 



V. 



GENERAL WYATT, MRS. WYATT, CONSTANCE, 
and BARTLETT. 

Mrs. Wyatt, hastening to bow herself over 
Constance's fallen head : " Oh, what is it, Con- 
stance ? " As Constance makes no reply, she lifts 
her eyes again to Bartlett's face. 

General Wyatt) peremptorily : " Well, sir ! " 

Bartlett, with bitter desperation : " Oh, you 
shall know ! " 

Constance, interposing : " I will tell ! You 
shall be spared that, at least." She has risen, 
and with her face still hidden in her handkerchief, 
seeks her father with an outstretched hand. He 
tenderly gathers her to his arms, and she droops 
a moment upon his shoulder ; then, with an elec- 
trical revolt against her own weakness, she lifts 
her head and dries her tears with a passion- 



 

ate energy. "He Oh, speak for me!" Her 
head falls again on her father's shoulder. 

Bartlett, with grave irony and self-scorn : " It 's 
a simple matter, sir; I have been telling Miss 
Wyatt that I love her, and offering to share with 
her my obscurity and poverty. I " 

General Wyatt, impatiently : " Curse your 
poverty, sir ! I 'm poor myself. Well ! " 

Bartlett: "Oh, that's merely the beginning; I 
have had the indecency to do this, knowing that 
what alone rendered me sufferable to her it was 
a cruel shame for me to know, and an atrocity 
for me to presume upon. I " 

General Wyatt: "I authorized this knowledge 
on your part when I spoke to your friend, and 
before he went away he told me all he had said 
to you." 

Bartlett, in the first stages of petrifaction : 
" Cummings ? " 

General Wyatt: "Yes." 

Bartlett : " Told you that I knew whom I was 
like ? " 

General Wyatt: "Yes." 



 

Bartlett, very gently : " Then I think that man 
will be lost for keeping his conscience too clean. 
Cummings has invented a new sin." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " James, James ! You told me 
that Mr. Bartlett didn't know." 

General Wyatt, contritely : " I let you think so, 
Margaret ; I didn't know what else to do." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Oh, James ! " 

Constance : " Oh, papa ! " She turns with 
bowed head from her father's arms, and takes 
refuge in her mother's embrace. General Wyatt, 
released, fetches a compass round about the par- 
lor, with a face of intense dismay. He pauses in 
front of his wife. 

General Wyatt : " Margaret, you must know the 
worst, now." 

Mrs. Wyatt, in gentle reproach, while she softly 
caresses Constance's hair: "Oh, is there anything 
worse, James ? " 

General Wyatt, hopelessly : " Yes : I 'm afraid 
I have been to blame," 

Bartlett : " General Wyatt, let me retire. I " 

General Wyatt: "No, sir. This concerns you, 
 



 

too, now. Your destiny has entangled you with 
our sad fortunes, and now you must know them 
all." 

Constance, from her mother's shoulder: "Yes, 
stay, whatever it is. If you care for me, 
nothing can hurt you any more, now." 

General Wyatt : " Margaret, Constance ! If I 
have been mistaken in what I have done, you must 
try somehow to forgive me ; it was my tenderness 
for you both misled me, if I erred. Sir, let me ad- 
dress my defense to you. You can see the whole 
matter with clearer eyes than we." At an implor- 
ing gesture from Bartlett, he turns again to Mrs. 
Wyatt. " Perhaps you are right, sir. Margaret, 
when I had made up my mind that the wretch 
who had stolen our child's heart was utterly unfit 
and unworthy " 

Constance, starting away from her mother with a 
cry : " Ah, you did drive him from me, then ! I 
knew, I knew it ! And after all these days and 
weeks and months that seem years and centuries of 
agony, you tell me that it was you broke my heart ! 
No, no, I never will forgive you, father ! Where 



 

is he? Tell me that! Where is my husband the 
husband you robbed me of? Did you kill him, 
when you chose to crush my life ? Js he dead ? 
If he 's living I will find him wherever he is. No 
distance and no danger shall keep me from him.
