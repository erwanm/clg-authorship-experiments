ballast, too ; I never see the balloon so steady 
before. 

Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and 
wondered what we better do with it ; it was good 
sand, and it didn't seem good sense to throw it 
away. Jim says : 

' Mars Tom, can't we tote it back home en sell 
it ? How long'll it take ? ' 

' Depends on the way we go.' 

' Well, sah, she's wuth a quarter of a dollar a 
load at home, en I reckon we's got as much as 
twenty loads, hain't we ? How much would dat 
be?' 

' Five dollars.' 

' By jings, Mars Tom, le's shove for home right 
on de spot ! Hit's more'n a dollar en a half apiece, 
hain't it ? ' 

'Yes.' 

' Well, ef dat ain't makin' money de easiest 
ever I struck ! She jes' rained in — never cos' us a 
lick o' work. Le's mosey right along, Mars Tom.' 

But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so 
busy and excited he never heard him. Pretty soon 
he says : 

' Five dollars — sho ! Look here, this sand's 
worth— worth — why, it's worth no end of money.' 

' How is dat, Mars Tom ? Go on, honey, go 
on!' 

 Well, the minute people knows it's genuwyne 
sand from the genuwyne Desert of Sahara, they'll 
just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold of 
some of it to keep on the whatnot in a vial with a 
label on it for a curiosity. All we got to do is to 
put it up in vials and float around all over the 
United States and peddle them out at ten cents 
apiece. We've got all of ten thousand dollars' 
worth of sand in this boat.' 

Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and 
begun to shout whoopjamboreehoo ; and Tom says : 

'And we can keep on coming back and fetching 
sand, and coming back and fetching more sand, 
and just keep it a-going till we've carted this whole 
Desert over there and sold it out ; and there ain't 
ever going to be any opposition, either, because 
we'll take out a patent.' 

' My goodness ! ' I says. ' We'll be as rich as 
Creosote, won't we, Tom ? ' 

' Yes — Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish 
was hunting in that little hill for the treasures of 
the earth, and didn't know he was walking over 
the real ones for a thousand miles. He was 
blinder than he made the driver.' 

'Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be 
worth ? ' 

' Well, I don't know yet. It's got to be ciphered, 
and it ain't the easiest job to do, either, because 
it's over four million square miles of sand at ten 
cents a vial.' 

Jim was awful excited, but this faded it out 
considerable, and he shook his head and says : 

'Mars Tom, we can't 'ford all dem vials — a 
king couldn't. We better not try to take de whole 
Desert, Mars Tom — de vials gwyne to bust us, sho.' 

Tom's excitement died out too, now, and I 
reckoned it was on account of the vials, but it 
wasn't. He set there thinking, and got bluer and 
bluer, and at last he says : 

' Boys, it won't work ; we got to give it up.' 

' Why, Tom ? ' 

' On account of the duties.' 

I couldn't make nothing out of that, neither 
could Jim. I says : 


' What is our duty, Tom ? Because if we can't 
git around it, why can't we just do it? People 
often has to.' 

But he says : 

' Oh, it ain't that kind of duty. The kind I 
mean is a tax. Whenever you strike a frontier — 
that's the border of a country, you know — you find 
a Custom house there, and the Gov'ment officers 
comes and rummages amongst your things and 
charges a big tax, which they call a duty, because 
it's their duty to bust' you if they can ; and if you 
don't pay the duty they'll hog your sand. They 
call it confiscating, but that don't deceive nobody — 
it's just hogging, and that's all it is. Now, if we 
try to carry this sand home the way we're pointed 
now, we got to climb fences till we git tired — just 
frontier after frontier — Egypt, Arabia, Hindostan, 
and so on — and they'll all whack on a duty, and so 
you see, easy enough, we can't go that road.' 

'Why, Tom,' I says, 'we can sail right over 
their old frontiers ; how are they going to stop us ? ' 

He looked sorrowful at me, and says, very 
grave : 

' Huck Finn, do you think that would be 
honest ? ' 

I hate them kind of interruptions. I never 
said nothing, and he went on : 

' Well, we're shut off the other way, too. If we 
go back the way we've come, there's the New York 
Custom house, and that is worse than all of them 
others put together, on account of the kind of 
cargo we've got.' 

'Why?' 

' Well, they can't raise Sahara sand in America, 
of course, and when they can't raise a thing there, 
the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent, on 
it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise 
it.' 

' There ain't no sense in that, Tom Sawyer.' 

' Who said there was ? What do you talk to 
me like that for, Huck Finn ? You wait till I say 
a thing's got sense in it before you go to accusing 
me of saying it.' 

' All right ; consider me crying about it, and 
sorry. Go on.' 

Jim says : 

' Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty on to every- 
thing we can't raise in America, en don't make no 
'stinction twix' anything ? ' 

' Yes, that's what they do.' 

 Mars Tom, ain't de blessin' o' de Lord de mos' 
valuable thing dey is ? ' 

' Yes, it is.' 

' Don't de preacher stan' up in de pulpit en call 
it down on de people ? ' 

' Yes.' 

' Whan do it come from ? ' 

' From heaven.' 

' Yassir ! you's jes' right, 'deed you is, honey — 
it come from heaven, en dat's a foreign country. 
Now den ! do dey put a tax on dat blessin' ? ' 

' No, they don't.' 

 'Course dey don't ; en so it stan' to reason 
dat you's mistaken, Mars Tom. Dey wouldn't put 
de tax on po' truck like san', dat everybody ain't 
'bleeged to have, en leave it off'n de bes' thing 
dey is, which nobody can't git along widout.' 

Tom Sawyer was stumped ; he see Jim had got 
him where he couldn't budge. He tried to wiggle 

out by saying they had forgot to put on that tax, but 
they'd be sure to remember about it next Session 
of Congress, and they'd put it on ; but that was 
a poor lame come-off, and he knowed it. He said 
there warn't nothing foreign that warn't taxed but 
just that one, and so they couldn't be consistent
