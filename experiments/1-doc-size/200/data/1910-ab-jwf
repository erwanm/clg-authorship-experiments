Winterbournc thumped the floor with his stick and set a 
guard upon his tongue. 

" 1 should rather," he said at length, " put the girl into a 
factory and let her earn day's wages." 

" What, Lilian ? Don't, John. She couldn't work in a 
factory." 

" Then let her starve," said Winterbourne, opening the 
door and stepping out. " We'll all starve before we conjure 
up patronesses out of Jelly bys and the women's clubs where 
they riot and batten." 

Not once had it happened, when he threw himself with a 
kind of abandon into these futile rages, that his wife had 
laughed. She never could laugh. They were solemn earnest 
to her. Now he saw the tears coming, in the old way, and 
grasped his stick and strode off, furious. Catherine stood a 
moment watching him, despair in her heart and on her face. 
Then she went droopingly in and Hunter met her at the 
door, saying in a wheedling voice, — 

" Could I help you, Mrs. Winterbourne, about moving 
furniture round, or anything? " 



 



IT was "down the road" where the Ramsays lived, 
though Clyde had streets now, properly bricked, and the 
road, according to the old sense, began outside the assem- 
blage of commodious houses and ran straight to the wharyes, 
smelling ever more and more of clams and tar. But Clyde 
was all country, even in the heart of it, where a few of the 
old houses had been hatefully transformed, the fences re- 
placed by a stone coping, verandas and bow-windows cruelly 
blotching old-time simplicities. Living was very peaceful 
here because the individual found such elbow-room. If a 
man performed the oddest antics, he was not perpetually 
reminded of them and his after peace endangered. The 
listeners in twenty houses where the little bird of casual 
rumor flew at once, might laugh, for the general sense of 
humor was robust, but the laughter was indulgent, veined 
redly with the recognition that human nature is of an eccen- 
tric pattern, and who knows where it might break next, 
with so many seams across ? 

It was a kindly place, the old dovetailing so closely into 
the new that after all it didn't know how new it was, how 
ready for seed which should not be all poppy and balm, as 
it used to be in past days when the best families were about 
all heaven was expected to see and take note of, and the 
others worked for the best ones and touched caps to them 
almost feudally. It was quite diflFerent now, the outsider 
could have seen, though Clyde itself still looked at its own 
image in the pond and thought there was nothing else to 
be mirrored there, except of course the blue heaven, and 



 





that was intended for a background. But in the outskirts, 
people of another sort were populous. They were clammers, 
and Dwight Hunter was sending the clams up to market. 
Certain other of the men were working for him " by the day," 
and he was letting them out to the more prosperous who 
wanted lawns kept up and gardens petted. Then there was 
talk of starting creameries down by the Point, and of these 
also Hunter was chief prophet. The town was not asleep, 
and though it kept its older attitude of somnolence, it 
would have you understand that presently it meant to be 
broad awake. 

Winterbourne went striding along, pounding with his 
stick which he did not need with any middle-aged man's 
necessity, but adopted as another vehicle of utterance. So, 
when he was a boy, had he seen his grandfather stride and 
stamp, but, he would innocently have told you, his grand- 
father had a whirlwind of a temper and behaved tempestu- 
ously indoors and out. When he reached the Ramsays' 
house, he stood for a moment at the end of the garden-path, 
chuckling with anticipatory delight to see how many faces 
were at the window awaiting him. There were four, exactly 
the count he had expected, and he prolonged the moment 
in artful contemplation of an imaginary something he was 
turning over with his stick, to whet anticipation to its limit. 

The house, a rambling square, three-storied, with yellow 
paint coming off in blisters, had more of the look of departed 
grandeur than Winterbourne's own. But the buds had be- 
gun to swell on the jessamine wreathing the tall rounded 
trellis at the door, and it could be seen that, when spring 
was fairly at work upon it, the tangled luxuriance of the 
growth would be wonderful. A window came up, and child- 
ish voices rose in a tyrannous treble. 

" Come along, Jackie 1 Come along ! Come along ! " 



 





Winterbourne raised his stick and shook it at them. 

" Put down that window ! " he returned, in stentorian 
measure, " or you'll catch your deaths. Put it down ! If 
you don't, I'll turn myself into a snow man and melt." 

The cries broke into giggles, and the window went down 
swiftly. Winterbourne, vainglorious over his own discipline, 
strode on to the house where he was nobody but Jack, by 
his own decree, when it had been found that small tongues 
stuck on the plentiful syllables of his appropriate name. 
The door had not closed on him when, with a chorus of 
squeals, the four were upon him : Teeny, the baby, very 
little, in blue trousers ridiculously small ; Tiny, the next, 
also trousered, who had been the previous year what Teeny 
was now; Tony, very much of a boy, he thought himself; 
Tonty, the girl whose hair had begun to be long ; and Tim, 
really grown-up, who lay on the sitting-room sofa with his 
long legs over the end, figuring on a piece of paper backed 
against a book. Winterbourne loved the welcome he was 
getting, three children clinging to his hands and legs and 
trying to climb up to the vantage-ground of his shoulders, 
Tonty standing off a step in maiden modesty but looking 
her shy adoration and her plain desire to be at the climbing, 
and Tim calling from the sitting-room, — 

" Come in here. Jack." He could compass the three syl- 
lables, being grown-up, but he liked the privilege of short- 
ening, because it made him more a man. " Come in here 
before you let those nimshis scuttle you." 

They all went in, Tonty now by Tim, saying in her 
motherly little way, — 

" Get up, Tim. You don't want to lie there, and make 
Jackie come to you." 

"Do, too," said Tim. 

He said it impudently, but no one would have cared. 



 



JOHN WINTERBOURNFS FAMILY 6$ 

because he was such a pleasing youth, with blue eyes, guile- 
less and full of glee, and beauties that fulfilled all the worn 
poetic similes. It was true that his skin was roses and milk, 
his hair as yellow as the sun. It curled with a vigor he re- 
sented, because it feminized him in a hateful way. Tim was 
a beautiful youth, although he did not look at all as he 
could have wished. A black-eyed brigand was the man he 
would have liked to be. Winterbourne, seeing him in his 
sun-god radiance, wondered again, as he often had, how 
Mrs. Jellyby, with her weatherworn skin and her unbusked 
redundances, could have given birth to such glorious 
children. 

The floor about the reclining Timothy was strewn with 
scraps of paper, all closely figured. He made a sweep of his 
long arm and gathered them up. 

" See here. Jack," said he. " See what I 've found out this 
morning.'' 

Winterbourne, listening, took up the youngest child and 
settled her on his shoulder, where she sat still, looking gravely 
down at the others, as if being enthroned were enough. She 
had no sense of triumph, it was evident, only a grave recog- 
nition that fortune had come to her. It might hit any of the 
others next time, this Olympian shower, but now she was 
the beloved. Tim was arranging his slips with deft motions 
of his long white fingers. 

" If I had bought a hundred shares of Anakim," he de- 
livered with conviction, " bought it, that is, four weeks ago, 
I could have sold it in three days and made eight hundred
