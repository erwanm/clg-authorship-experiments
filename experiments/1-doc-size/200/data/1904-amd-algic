it then, but marriage was supposed to settle a man. 

The figure of Polly Morrison flashed up before me. 
Why, I could not tell, for I had not thought of her 
until she appeared like a strange, splendid vision. 
There was a mocking light in her glittering eyes. Why 
did she not forbid the bans ? She only smiled in a sort 
of triumph. 

The next morning Nanette came for me to go shop 
ping with her, and though we had not a very extensive 
array of stores, still we had a nice variety of goods. 
Some of the older people thought there was too much 
catering to the pride of life. We made one or two 
calls, we chatted with the clerks we knew, and when I 
reached home Dan was just going away. He and 
father had been examining some business papers. We 
merely spoke. I ran in the kitchen to hurry Jolette 
about the dinner. 

Chris came in the next morning. There was a won 
derful preacher from England who could give our 
town but this one evening. Mrs. Hayne wanted me to 
come over to supper and we would both go. "And I'll 
see you home," said Chris, "if you can't stay all night." 

I kissed father and went away. We had grown so 
much more caressing since his hurt. There was 
another neighbor in to tea. We started early and it 





was well we did, for before service time the church was 
packed. 

As I said, I liked the full, hearty singing. The 
strange clergyman had a rather imposing presence. I 
may as well confess that I was not particularly fond 
of sermons, but after a little I became strangely inter 
ested in this. There was the heroic self-sacrifice in it 
that appeals strongly to youth, taking up the duty set 
plainly before one and not making mean and shifty 
evasions. But unless the sacrifice or the work had 
some high purpose in view for God or the neighbor, it 
was in vain and useless. We were to help in the daily 
life that God gave us, to live out at our very best and 
truest. Simply praying for our neighbor was not all, 
when there was something to do. 

I think I lost sight of the spiritual application. I 
kept looking at a thing that seemed set before me to 
do, and it grew clearer and clearer even if I did 
shrink from it. I was to trust to the promise "My 
grace shall be sufficient." I was moved, exalted. I 
can do the sermon no sort of justice, but every one for 
weeks afterward talked of it, and Chris was most 
enthusiastic. 

When we came home father and Dan were playing 
checkers, and they were both excellent players. Father 
held up his finger and merely nodded to Chris, who 
said good-night, for he knew how Dan hated to be 
interrupted in a game. I came and stood by them. 
This was the rubber, each had won one game. They 
were almost at the last and so evenly balanced that it 
seemed to me there was something more at stake 



 

than a mere king row. A human soul was to be 
crowned or Is there such a determining power as 
fate ? If father won I should be free, if Dan, I should, 
I must be his wife. I watched with strained eyes. Fin 
gers were hardly touched, then lifted. Father's fore 
head seemed gathered in a knot, Dan's face was smil 
ing with that wonderful ease he had, the French call it 
insouciance. Father moved Dan's last man went into 
the king row, and Dan smiled over at me. 



CHAPTER XV 

HOW MUCH WAS LOVE? 

WE went on just the same for a week or two, friendly, 
pleasant, but some influence I could not shake off drew 
me nearer. Even now I suppose Dan was a fascinating 
man, since girls yielded so readily to his sway and older 
women made friends with him. 

It was the full of the harvest moon, a magnificent, 
glowing night. There were some corn-husking bees 
to wind up with a dance in a new barn. There were 
boats going out rowing, for the lake was like a sea of 
glass. Dan really hated the water I loved it dearly, 
but the great lake was occasionally deceitful at its 
blandest, and often a monster in its power to small 
craft. The larger vessels were safe enough. Father 
and I took a sail now and then, but Dan never went for 
pleasure. 

"Ruth," he said this evening, "do you remember the 
ride you once had on Chita? Come out and take an 
other. There may not be a night like this in a year 
again." 

"Oh, I was such a little girl then. And we cannot 
both ride her now," I protested. 



 

"Why not?" In the moon floods of light his eyes 
transfixed me. 

"Because I am so much larger. And you have grown 
stouter." 

He laughed. "See here," and catching me with one 
hand he whirled me off the steps and clear around. 

"You weigh about seventy-five pounds," gravely. 
"If I asked Chita to carry seventy-five pounds of grain 
and my stoutness she would go off like a bird." 

"I weigh ninety-two," I returned with dignity. 

"If it was ninety-four you would have to ride all the 
same," in a determined tone. "Do you want anything 
about you? But it is like a summer night. Come, I 
told your father I was going to take you. Or would 
you rather go to the dance?" 

"Suppose I would?" I said saucily. 

"We could go to the dance afterward." 

For a week we had gone on as if nothing had hap 
pened. But every day the duty had grown clearer to 
me. Here was the son father needed. I could make 
all of his life easier. He was the dearest person in the 
world to me, and why should I not think of him first? 
There seemed two sides to me, which there would not 
have been if I had loved and understood truly what 
marriage meant, that it was not all father's comfort and 
interest. 

"Come." He sprang on Chita. Then he made a 
sudden decisive motion with his arm, and gathered me 
up in front of him. 

"I should have a pillion," I began complainingly. 

"I want you here, just here, where I can see you and 





cannot lose you. If I did, your father would beat out 
my brains with his crutch, and I would deserve it. 
There, are you comfortable?" 

He settled me and placed his arm tightly about me, 
turning Chita with his right hand. 

"I am very uncomfortable," I retorted petulantly. 

"You won't mind it in a moment when we get out 
of this beastly street." 

"Oh, don't !" I tried to loosen his arm. "I can't get 
my breath. I don't want to go." 

"Will that do? I want you to be comfortable and 
happy. Five different girls have asked me to the dance 
to-night. Four of them would have been miserable if 
I had confined my attentions to one, and the whole five 
would have been indignant if I had distributed them im 
partially. And you are ungrateful." 

Something in his tone touched me. After a pause 
he said, "And you have them all. Ruth, I want you 
to love me with your whole soul and body. I want you 
to marry me." 

"There is Miss Campbell and Miss Conover. Think 
how much finer looking they are. Oh, I can't think 
why you should want to marry me." 

"Well, queer as it may seem, and indifferent as you 
are now, there are some other points. I want you. 
I've resolved to win you, and shall do my best. And 
your father needs my assistance, may for some time to
