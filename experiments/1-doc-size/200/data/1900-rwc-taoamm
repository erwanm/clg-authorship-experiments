TROUBLE FOR TWO


A Note Found by Young Harroll on his Dresser the Evening of his Arrival
at Palm Beach.

  "11.30 A.M.

     "DEAR JIM--Everything is spoiled, after all! Father's failing health
     has suddenly become a serious matter, and we are going to try the
     'nature cure,' or whatever they call it, at Avalon Island. I had no
     idea he was really ill. Evidently he is alarmed, for we have only
     been here six days, and in a few minutes we are to start for
     Avalon. Isn't it perfectly horrid? And to think that you are
     coming this evening and expecting to find us here!

      "Father says you can't come to Avalon; that only invalids are
      received (I didn't know I was one, but it seems I'm to take the
      treatment, too!), and he says that nobody is received for less
      than a month's treatment, so I suppose that bars you even if you
      were self-sacrificing enough to endure a 'nature cure' for the
      pleasure of spending two weeks with [me, crossed out] us.

      "I'm actually on the verge of tears when I think of all we had
      planned to do together! And there's my maid at the door, knocking.
      Good-by. You will write, won't you?

  "CATHARINE DELANCY."

       

Mr. James Harroll to Miss Catharine Delancy, Avalon, Balboa County,
Florida.

  "HOLY CROSS LIGHT, FEBRUARY 15.

     "DEAR CATHARINE--Your father was right: they refuse to take me at
     Avalon. As soon as I found your note I telegraphed to Avalon for
     accommodations. It seems Avalon is an island, and they have to wait
     for the steamers to carry telegrams over from the mainland. So the
     reply has just reached me that they won't take me for less than a
     month; and my limit from business is two weeks or give up my
     position with your father.

      "Yesterday I came out here to Holy Cross Spring to shoot ducks.
      I'd scarcely begun shooting, at dawn, when along came a couple of
      men through the fog, rowing like the mischief plump into my
      decoys, and I shouted out, 'What the deuce are you about?' and
      they begged my pardon, and said they had thought the point
      unoccupied, and that the fog was thicker than several
      things--which was true.

      "So I invited them into the blind to--oh, the usual ceremony--and
      they came, and they turned out to be Jack Selden--the chap I told
      you about who was so decent to me in Paris--and his guide.

      "So we had--ceremonies--several of them--and Selden stayed to
      shoot with me over my decoys, and our bag was fifty-three, all big
      duck except fifteen bluebills.

      "Selden is a godsend to me. We're going to stay out here to-night
      at the lighthouse, and shoot all to-morrow if it doesn't blow too
      hard. It's blowing great guns now. I'm here in the lighthouse,
      writing in the glow of a lamp in the keeper's living-room, with
      his good little wife sewing by the fire and a half-dozen of his
      kids tumbling about on the floor. It's a pretty sight; I love
      children and firesides and that sort of thing. They've got hold of
      Selden now, and are making him tell stories of adventure. He's
      been all over the world, and is perfectly crazy to get married.
      Says he would prefer a widow with yellow hair and blue eyes. Do
      you know any? He's a nice chap."

      "Catharine, I wish I were in Avalon. They could put me in a
      strait-jacket and I wouldn't care as long as [you were, crossed
      out] I could be with [you, crossed out] your father and you in
      Avalon.

      "It's growing late, and Selden and I should be on the
      ducking-grounds to-morrow before dawn. The keeper's wife says it
      will blow too hard, but Selden only smiles. He's a cool one, and
      if he has the nerve to go out I'll go, too.

      "With sincere regards to your father and every wish for his speedy
      recovery, I remain

  "Yours faithfully,
  "JAMES HARROLL."

  "FEBRUARY 16.

     "CATHARINE--I think this is the end. Selden and I have been blown
     out to sea in a rowboat, and it's leaking. I only want to say
     good-by. Telegraph Selden's mother, Lenox, Massachusetts. I have
     nobody to notify. Good-by.

  "JAMES HARROLL."

       

Telegram to James Harroll, Received and Opened by the Keeper while

Missing.

  "JAMES HARROLL, HOLY CROSS LIGHT, FLORIDA, EAST COAST:

     "Don't run any risks. Be careful for our sakes. Terrible storm on
     the coast reported here. Wire me that you are safe.

  "CATHARINE DELANCY,
  "Avalon, Florida."

       

Telegrams Addressed to Young Harroll, and Opened by the Keeper of the
Lighthouse after the Search-boats Had Returned.

No. 1.

     "Why don't you telegraph us? Your silence and the reports of the
     storm alarm us. Reply at once.

  "CATHARINE."

No. 2.

     "Wire Catharine, Jim. You surely were not ass enough to go out in
     such a storm.

  "S. DELANCY."

No. 3.

     "For pity's sake telegraph to me that you are safe. I cannot sleep.

  "CATHARINE."

       

Telegram to Miss Catharine Delancy, Avalon, Florida.

  "HOLY CROSS LIGHT.

     "MISS CATHARINE DELANCY:

      "Rowboat containing Mr. Harroll and Mr. Selden blown out to sea.
      Search-boats returned without finding any trace of them.

  "CASWELL, Keeper."

       

Telegram from Mr. Delancy to Keeper of Holy Cross Light.

     "CASWELL:

      "Charter a fast ocean-going tug and as many launches as necessary.
      Don't give up the search. Spare no expense. Check mailed to you
      to-day.

      "I will give ten thousand dollars to the man who rescues James
      Harroll. You may draw on me for any amount necessary. Keep me
      constantly informed of your progress by wire.

  "STEPHEN DELANCY."

       

In from the open sea drifted the castaways, the sun rising in tropic
splendor behind them, before them a far strip of snowy surf edging green
shores.

Selden sat in the bow, bailing; Harroll dug vigorously into the Atlantic
with both oars; a heavy flood-tide was doing the rest. Presently Selden
picked up the ducking-glass and examined the shore.

Harroll rested his oars, took a pull at the mineral water, and sighed
deeply. "Except for the scare and the confounded leak it's been rather
amusing, hasn't it?" he said.

"It's all right.... Hope you didn't set that farewell message afloat."

"What message?"

"Oh--I thought I saw you scribbling in your notebook and----"

"And what?"

"And stick the leaf into the bottle of gun-oil. If I was mistaken,
kindly give me my bottle of gun-oil."

"Pooh!" said Harroll. "The storm was magnificent. Can't a man jot down
impressions? Open a can of sardines, will you? And pass me the bread,
you idiot!"
