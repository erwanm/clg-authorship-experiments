Once more the tender word touched him. He passed his hand over his
eyes as if to hide something.

‘If you were only free!’ he sighed.

Maria made a little movement.

‘The very thought of that is wrong,’ she answered bravely. ‘You
must not think of it, you must never say it.’

‘I wish your husband no ill,’ Castiglione answered, in a sterner
tone than she had heard yet. ‘I did him a great injury. I would
make reparation if I knew how. But I am a man, Maria, a man like
any other, and I love you in a man’s way, and if Montalto died I
should want you for my wife, as you should be. We have promised
that between us there shall be no word or thought of which we need
be ashamed, even before your husband, if he were here; but more
than that I will not promise, and that is already as much as any
man could keep.’

Maria shook her head gravely and waited a moment before she
answered.

‘I should owe myself to his memory if he were dead,’ she said at
last. ‘A lifetime of faithfulness, cost what it may, is not enough
to expiate what I did.’

Castiglione judged her as men judge the women they love, and he
knew that for the present it was useless to oppose her. He folded
his hands and listened, and she did not see that his fingers
strained upon each other; nor could she guess that his heart was
not beating as quietly now as when he had sat down opposite her a
little while ago.

‘That is the one condition on which we can see each other,’ she
went on. ‘There must be no thought of any earthly union--ever! If
you feel that you are strong enough for that, Balduccio, then come
back to Rome as soon as you can. If you can exchange into your old
regiment again, do so. If not, come now and then, when you can get
leave. We may see each other once a week, at least once a week! The
world cannot blame us for that, after all these years. It will be
little enough, once a week! And sometimes, perhaps, we might meet
in some gallery, in some quiet museum where only the foreigners go,
and we could walk about and talk, and the world will never know it.’

Castiglione smiled at her innocent ignorance of lovers’ tricks,
for he was quieter now, and very happy at the thought of seeing
her often. It would never have occurred to him to do the foolish
thing of which Teresa Crescenzi had suspected him on the previous
afternoon.

‘The great matter is that I am to see you,’ he said; ‘that the
separation is over, and that we love each other!’

‘That--yes! Oh, that above and beyond all things, and for ever and
ever.’

The lovelight was in her eyes as she gazed at him, and her parted
lips were delicately beautiful. Again his hands pressed one another
very hard, and he felt that he set his teeth. He suddenly wondered
how long he could keep his promise, and by what manner of death
he would choose to end his life when he felt that he was going to
break it. She was putting upon him a heavier trial and a far harder
expiation than she knew. Her eyes were so dark and tender, her
parted lips were so sweet to see! In her reliance on herself and
him she had already loosened the great restraint that had bound her
since the evil hour; she cared not to hide the outward looks of
love. She even longed to see in his eyes what she felt in her own.

‘You love me less than I love you, dear,’ she said softly. ‘You are
less happy than I am, because we are to meet often!’

Without a word Castiglione rose from his seat and went to the
window at the further end of the room, and stood there, looking
down through the slits of the blinds. Maria half understood, and
sighed.

‘Forgive me,’ she said, rather sorrowfully.

‘I’m only a man, Maria,’ he answered, turning his head. ‘You must
not make it too hard for me. I love you in a man’s way, and you
have made me promise to love you in yours. I must learn, before I
can be sure of myself.’

Maria reflected a moment. Her thoughts were full of an ideal
sacrifice.

‘Balduccio!’ She called to him gently, for he was looking down at
the street again. ‘Shall I give you back your word and tell you to
go away for a long time, if it’s going to be so hard for you?’

‘No!’

The single syllable was rough and strong, for he resented what she
had said. She rose too and went to him at the window.

‘Are you angry with me?’ she asked humbly.

His hand grasped her bare wrist and tightened upon it almost as if
he meant to hurt her, and he spoke in short, harsh sentences.

‘No, I am not angry. I love you too much. You don’t understand what
I feel. How should you? I’ve been as faithful to you as you’ve
been to your husband all these years. And now I’m with you, and we
are alone, and we love each other, and I’m nothing but a man after
all--and if you look at me in the old way I shall go mad or kill
you.’

He drew her wrist roughly to him and kissed her hand once,
roughly, and dropped it. He had done that in the old days too, and
Maria saw it all again in a violent flash, as men see danger ahead
in a storm at night, lit up by quivering lightning.

She drew breath sharply and turned away from him. She leaned upon
the mantelpiece and rested her throbbing forehead upon her hands.

‘Oh, why have we these earthly bodies of ours?’ she moaned. ‘Why?
why? Why could not God have made us like the angels?’

‘Why not, indeed!’ echoed Castiglione, in bitter unbelief.

‘Even like the fallen angels!’ she cried desperately. ‘They fell
by pride, but not by this! Are there not temptations for heart and
soul and mind enough to try us, to raise us up if we overcome, to
damn us if we yield? Enough to send us to hell or heaven--without
this? O God, that what Thou hast made in Thine own image should be
so vile, so vile, so vile!’

Her despair was real; her cry came from an almost breaking heart.
Castiglione came to her now and laid his hand gently upon her
shoulder.

‘Maria! Look at me, dear! Don’t be afraid!’

She raised her head timidly from her hands and turned her eyes
slowly to him, more than half afraid. But when she saw that his own
were calm and grave again, she gave one little cry of relief and
buried her face upon his shoulder, clinging to him with both hands;
and her touch did not stir his pulse now.

‘No, I’m not afraid of you!’ she softly cried. ‘It was only a
moment, dear, only one dreadful moment, for I trust you with myself
as I would trust you with my soul! Sometimes--’ she looked up
lovingly to his face--‘sometimes each of us must be brave for both,
you know. As we are now, you might even kiss me once and I should
fear nothing!’

He smiled and bent down and kissed her cheek; and there was no
thought in him that he would not have told her. But then he gently
took her hands from his shoulder and made her sit down as they had
sat before.

‘That was not wrong, was it?’ she asked, with a happy smile.

‘No,’ he answered quietly, ‘there was no wrong in that, neither to
you nor to the others.’

‘I’m glad,’ she answered, ‘so glad! But it would not be right to do
it often.’

‘No, not often. Not for a long time again.’

They were both silent in the ebbing of the tide which at the full
had nearly swept them from their feet. At heart, in spite of all,
there was something strangely innocent in them both. Castiglione’s
friends would have wondered much if they could have understood
him, as some of the graver sort might. Few men of his age, beyond
the cloister, knew less of women’s ways and women’s love than he;
few soldiers, indeed, and surely not one of his brother officers.
To wear the King’s uniform ten years in the gayest and smartest
cavalry regiment of the service is not a school for austere virtue
or innocence of heart. All that Castiglione’s comrades noticed
was that he talked but little of women, who were often the chief
subject of the others’ conversation, and that he was very reticent
about the ones he knew. They respected him for that, on the whole,
though they sometimes chaffed him a little in a friendly way. They
all agreed among themselves that he had some secret and lasting
attachment for a woman of their own class whose name he succeeded
in keeping from them in spite of their repeated attempts to find
it out. He was such a manly man that they liked him the better
for it; the more, because great reticence was not their own chief
quality. For the rest, though, he was poorer than most of them,
he was always ready to join in anything except a general raid on
womankind. He played cards with them, and when he could lose no
more, he said so; he was honest in matters of horseflesh and gave
sound advice; he never shirked his duty and left it for another
to do; he was good-natured in doing a comrade’s work when he was
asked to do it for any good reason; he was the best rider in the
regiment, and he never talked about what he had done, or could
do, with a horse; he was not over clever, but he was good company
and told a story with a touch of humour; and he never borrowed
from a brother officer, nor refused to lend, if he had any money.
Altogether, he was the best comrade in the world and everybody
liked and respected him, from the rather supercilious colonel, who
was an authentic duke, and the crabbed old major, who had been
wounded at Dogali, to the rawest recruit that was drafted in from a
Sardinian village or a shepherd’s hut in the Apennines.

But none of all those who liked and respected him guessed that in
