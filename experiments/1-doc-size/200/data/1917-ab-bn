comely, almost a heroic figure, standing there in her pose 
of strength, a woman built on large lines, of flowing curves 
and yet not an abundant flesh. Her blonde hair was 
parted and went waving back from her face, to be con- 
fined in a heavy coil. She was fair, of velvety skin; her 
eyes were serene and her chin firm. She looked the 
mother, of an old-fashioned type. The eyes were of those 
that gaze out at us from dim portraits, and no one, per- 
haps not even the painter or the owner of the eyes her- 
self, knows their serenity is attained by the goading of a 
persistent will. 

" Mary ! " came the loud, imperious voice. " Mary ! " 
She did not move. A slight flush ran into her cheeks, 



 

and her eyes brightened. She was as still as some wood 
creature in its defensive trance. Only when the voice came 
nearer, to the tune of striding feet, did she break her pose 
and seem to waken to the need of answering. 

" Yes," she called. The tone was even silky, in its inno- 
cence. " I'm in the kitchen.'' 

The striding steps came on, and Neale's tall, tight-knit 
form came to the doorway and seemed to fill it. He was 
a gaunt, big man,, nearly fifty, his face keenly interroga- 
tive, his eyes sterr> They looked out questioningly, Mary 
sometimes thought, as if they were asking who meant to 
withstand his will. If he found anybody, the eyes said, 
he would make short work even of the possibility. Really 
he was a handsome man, his shaven face of a noble con- 
tour, and in any country assembly eyes turned toward 
him at his entrance and lingered on him. Perhaps they 
did not always note that his firm lips were slightly too 
thin. He stood there frowning a little, one hand above 
him on the casing of the door. Yet he was looking pleas- 
antly enough at Mary. Only it was his habit to frown 
with the intentness he gave to even the small demands of 
life. To him they were never small. He would have 
things scrupulously ordered. 

"IVyou go into Ardelia Brock's?" he inquired. His 
voice, deep enough but somewhat dry, was imperious in 
a negative way. He was so sure of getting what he 
wanted. 

" Yes," said Mary. She was looking down at her hand, 
studying it apparently but only perhaps to avoid looking 
at him. 

He had no doubt of the honesty of her intent. 

" You hurt your hand? " he inquired, frowning a little 
more. It always seemed to him foolish to get into difficulties. 


 

" No." She dropped it at her ;-'«ic, and now, conscious 
of her feint, she blushed a little. 

" Well," he continued, in some impatience at a waste of 
time over nothmg, " what'd she say? " 

" Nothing." 

" Nothin'? You asked her, didn't you? " 

Mary did not answer for perhaps a minute, and 
she was alive to the length of the Iiitvr> 1, irritated by 
it, too, because she could hear the the sitting- 
room, and it seemed to be ticking av\a  reprieve. 

"No," she said then, " in a low, relucant tone. "I 
didn't ask her. I couldn't." 

" Didn't ask her? " His voice sounded naive in its be- 
trayal. He hadn't quite realized he could even suggest 
anything that would not instantly be done. " Why didn't 
you?" 

A beautiful flush ran into her face. She seemed, in the 
glow of it, to make a little forward movement toward him, 
an entreating of her whole body, a suppliance so wanp 
that it was difficult to see how any man could resist it. 

" Thomas, I couldn't. Only you thinks Her husband 
buried yesterday. To ask her to sell the place." 

He stood considering her, in a perfect obtuseness to 
another point of view. He was not even meeting her won- 
derful flush and entreating charm with any recognizing 
warmth of his own. " Yes," he might have said, " I see, 
Mary. I know how much you feel it. But — " Then 
they would have gone on discussing it, he as implacable 
and she as reluctant as before ; but there would have been 
between them that consonant note, modulating their differ- 
ences to another key. 

" Well," he said, " she don't have to sell it unless she 
wants to. There's no harm findin' out whether she wants 
to, is there? " 



 

"But, Thomas, so soon. It's just as if" she hesitated, and then the tide of her emotion rose again. 
" What if it had been you and me, and somebody came to 
me and asked me to sell — " She stopped. His face had 
darkened in a threatening way. She remembered too late 
that a hint of his own departure from the world where 
he held so tight a rein always mysteriously offended him. 

" You go over there to-night," he said, " an' have a talk 
with her. I happen to know there's one or two thinkin' 
of that place. She needn't come to any conclusions now. 
Only get me the refusal. She needn't sign anything, tell 
her — not for a day or two." 

He turned away, not waiting for consent, it was so 
inevitable to him, and Mary's gaze followed him out of the 
room. But hearing his steps through the shed to the 
stable and his quick call to one of her sons, she went on 
into the sitting-room and sat down by the front window 
where she could just see the comer of Ardelia Brock's 
house. Mary's little sewing table was in front of her, and 
on it a billowing pile of unfinished work. She liked the 
nearness of the table, even when she had no mind to sew- 
ing. She knew then, if her husband came in, she could 
draw the soft, absorbing stuff toward her and, her eyes 
bent on it, talk to him, whatever topic he introduced, 
the more at ease. He never proposed light subjects that 
needed no consideration, either of her concurrence or soft 
preambles of almost incredible retreat. But now, her 
serious gaze on the corner of Ardelia Brock's little house, 
her mind was indubitably there, though it never ran far 
enough from her husband to dull her sensitiveness toward 
what he was sure to feel- and think. Ardelia's house stood 
for an old discontent in the Neale family. Thomas 
Neale's grandfather had been a warm-natured, generous 
man, given to seeing other-worldly values to the irritating

exclusion of present ones. He had taken compassion on 
David Brock, the grandfather of the David just now dead, 
living in a one-room shack and taking weekly trips to his 
courting which had no chance of being ended, and had told 
him he would give him a building lot out of his own farm, 
and lend him the money to put up a house. It was incred- 
ible, even in that country town where everybody was kind 
but never thought of crossing the line of customary benev- 
olence, that any landowner should do such an unheard-of 
deed. But the fact was accepted until Tom Neale's son 
grew up and then, suddenly, after the death of his father, 
he made it known that three acres out of the corner of 
his own front lot was an eyesore and an abomination, and 
he asked the Brock then inheriting, after the first owner, 
to sell the land. David the second was precisely like his 
father, earnest, hard working, but with an uncertain 
clutch that let opportunity slip, and he replied, in even 
a wounded earnestness, that the land was his and he had 
his family to support and couldn't sell. So it had been 
with the present Neale. On coming into his inheritance 
he had strenuously objected to the square cut out of his 
broad frontage, and begun, with the force of an inherited 
passion, to make offers for the land. But the Brocks had 
a sentiment for it. They were men of sentiment, of a shy 
sort, and it seemed to them just like a story that they 
had got their land by such an incredible gift — the more 
incredible because so many Neales wanted to take it back 
again, proving that old Tom Neale was one of a kind — 
and neither would the third Brock sell. And now he was 
dead and Thomas Neale thought his widow, in her pov- 
erty, might be prevailed upon, and was sending his wife 
to make inquiry. Mary had truly tried to ask the ques- 
tion last night when she went in, but Ardelia had received 
her so gladly so touched, in a wistful way, because Mary 



 

had come to her, that she had not been able to deliver 
her sordid errand. And she saw no better prospect of it 
now. 

As she sat and thought, her brows knit, her mouth set, 
she shook her head impatiently, hearing Aunt Tab sing- 
ing formlessly in a room above. It made it harder for 
her to think. Aunt Tab was Neale's sister, unmarried, 
older than he, and of a shrinking disposition that irritated him exceedingly. He had never known a Neale to 
be shy and quavering, and it filled him with a distaste he
