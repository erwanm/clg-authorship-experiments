it, since now it is for the convenience of passengers coming 
back, and she will not he subjected to curious eyes. There 
is a somewhat gruff, elderly man and a foolishly indul- 



 

gent mother of three children. Both parties rather divert 
her. 

It is a fine day early in September, but vegetation of 
all kinds has kept fresh and lovely from heavy dews and 
occasional rains. Here and there a maple hangs out a soli- 
tary twig of red leaves. The gardens are bright with a 
profusion of imperious autumnal flowers that hold up their 
heads like marching regiments. The bird songs are not so 
jubilant as those of June, and the insects prolong their 
notes in a wavering manner that is almost pathetic. 

Eegina finds that the tenant has gone out of the cottage, 
and two men are there making some repairs. She looks up 
a woman to come in and do the cleaning — the household 
matters gravitate naturally to her. Then she strolls up the 
hill, busy with a tangle of thoughts that surprises her. For 
all of life appears changed to her. The future has an in- 
scrutable cloud hovering about its most familiar aspects. 
Not two years since she came here with such high resolves, 
with a vital force that seemed ready to take hold of the 
highest purposes. She has educated herself up to an impos- 
sible standard, yes, she has disdained the common round. 
Oh, what is the meaning of all this unrest ? The unhesi- 
tating belief in the possibility of many things has merged 
into a kind of cynical enlightenment. She has been com- 
pelled to recede from the hasty generalizations that she has 
taken for truth, and feels stranded on a strange shore. 

Mr. Bradley is sitting on the porch in the afternoon sun- 
shine. He is like a picture with his thin, clear-cut face 
that would be at once pronounced aristocratic, his fine white 
skin where the wrinkles seem to lie delicately instead of 
taking the triumphant clutch of coming age. His silvery 
hair, his sloping shoulders, his white hands with their long 
nails, have such a gentlemanly aspect that you can hardly 
imagine him as being of any real service to the world, 
except for adornment. 

" Ah," he says with a nod, rubbing the thin hands cau- 
tiously, " I thought you would come. Did my boy surprise 
you beyond measure ? " and he gives a weak little laugh 





verging on insolence. " I could imagine the scene when he 
walked in with the youngest of you all on his arm. You 
girls do not appear to be in tremendous demand" — 

" There was no scene/' interrupts Kegina. " Mother felt 
hurt, as was natural, at the lack of confidence and respect. 
r)ut we supposed it would end that way presently." 

" No — did you really ? Why, I thought once it would 
be you. But you are rather too high, too grand. A man 
don't want such an overwhelming sort of wife. I don't 
believe you are the kind to marry. And your sister had 
better take that long-headed chap over yonder," nodding 
his head down the river. "Though I doubt if he will 
always come out on top ! " and he gives another rather 
shrill, unmeaning laugh. 

Regina's face flushes with indignation. It almost seems 
as if Mr. Bradley must have been drinking. His eyes 
have a shifty, exultant light, as if he gloated over some- 
thing. Surely marrying Perdita cannot have proved such a 
great victory when there was no real opposition. 

" Your son told you that we were making preparations to 
go in town ? " she questions coldly. 

"Yes." He nods and laughs again unpleasantly. "I 
shall miss your mother. I like your mother very much. 
Well, I like you all. We have had a pleasant summer 
together, but winter comes to every season, to life, to all 
things. It is best that you should go, of course. You 
came first, but you had no real right." 

" We never pretended to have the sole right to Bradley 
House," Regina says in a somewhat contemptuous tone. 
"You have decided then to keep it" — 

" My dear youug woman, there has been no question of 
keeping it that I know of. It always belonged to us, to 
me; I was born here. Circumstances " — and he pauses, 
looks terrified, and seems to shrink into himself. 

" Jasper will return here ? " 

" Why, where else would he go ? " irritably. " He can- 
not leave me alone for more than a few days. My health 
is not sood. Of course he will come back. He and PerJila 



 

can amuse themselyes fiddling and dancing if they like. 
Good heavens ! You should have seen her dance before 
she grew too stout. That put an end to it only in character 
pieces. What was I saying ? " his eyes full of alarm. 
"I was dreaming. I used to be fond enough of theatres 
when I was a young man. Jasper hated them aftei 
a while." 

Eegina walks across the porch, and raises the old-time 
lion's-head knocker. 

"Have yon come back to stay?" he asks, rising and 
turning his eyes sharply upon her. 

" I have not." Miss Halford is incensed. 

" But I want you to," he declares fretfully. " It's very 
lonesome without Jasper. Your mother and you, and — 
and Cynthia. When will you come? Come to-morrow, 
and stay until he returns. Have you any idea why he 
married that little brown thing ? She isn't pretty " — 

Martha opens the door. She only returned yesterday, 
and is surprised at the turn affairs have taken. 

"And you mean to leave such a child as Miss Perdita 
alone with them two men, and one on 'em half crazy ! ' ' 
she exclaims. " I'd as soon put her in the lion's den, au' 
be done with it ! Whatever possessed her to qo off and 
get married that way ? He's charmed her in my opinion, 
an' you ought all of yon to kept a better lookout. What 
does make you go way just at this time ? " 

Eegina explains that it is no new thought, that "Mr. 
Bradley will become the absolute owner of the house, and 
there will be a new master and new mistress, and it will be 
much more prudent for them to be quite away. Mrs. Crouse 
will look after Mrs. Jasper's comfort." 

"Well, I'd never leave her here, never!" is Martha's 
asseveration. 

 " You would have to leave her with her husband : " and 
.Eegina gives a dry, unmirthful smile. "It would be un- 
lawful to separate them." 

"Whatever possessed that child, Heaven only knows. 
He must have done it along of his violin. She was just 





like a charmed ereetur when he played, and them brown 
eyes of hern would grow bigger and wider, and she'd 
follow him round. Yes, depend upon it, the music did the 
business. Lord ! I've heard him make his fiddle cry real 
tears, I know." 

£egina goes through the rooms that Martha has been 
putting in very tolerable order. Some stores are to be 
sent up. 

" And we may come to-morrow," says the young lady. 

" To-morrow ! That's Friday. O Miss Eegina, don't ! 
I wouldn't take a journey or come into a house on Friday, 
for there'd be nothing but bad luck ; " and Martha's tone 
is imploring. 

Eegina smiles at the superstition, but she has a respect 
for the woman's feelings, a certain forethought also of 
having dismal verifications later on, that will not be cheer- 
ful to listen to, and impossible to combat. 

" Very well. Our week doesn't end until Saturday, and 
I suppose we will need to-morrow to pack. Then on the 
very first of the following week, we shall make ready to 
go to the new house. I have no idea when Jasper means 
to return." 

They have adopted his Christian name to avoid confu- 
sion, and partly on his own insistence ; but Eegina is glad 
of an excuse to go back to the more formal order. There 
is a curious fear in her soul already concerning Perdita. 
It is not any bodily harm she apprehends, but an intangi- 
ble premonition of coming unhappiness. For if Jasper 
cared at all for her, then he married Perdita from pique. 
The deeper significance is whether he is capable of a 
generous, tender love. 

She gets matters settled with Martha, and then goes her 
way. On the porch Mr. Bradley stops her again, and begs
