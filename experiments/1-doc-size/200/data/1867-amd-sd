 

the Vennard reign from a sort of angry compulsion, 
since the lives of their wives and little ones depended 
on their submission. 

Stephen Dane had not espoused either side very 
warmly. He was reticent, self-contained, or rather 
would be when the coming manhood had sufficient force 
to assert itself. He had been indifferent, for these re- 
strictions did not touch him. He was quite too proud 
to defraud his employer that rugged, ungracious sort 
of pride one meets with now and then. He did his 
work well on the same principle. All had gone rightly 
enough with him until within a week or so. But now 
he had begun a process dangerous to a weak mind, and 
the first step was dissatisfaction with the grovelling life 
he had hitherto led. 

In six months Mr. Vennard could see just where he 
stood, and glance down a golden future. But pros- 
perity did not mellow his heart, nor send any rich, gen- 
erous juices through his frame. He seemed to con- 
tract instead. He drew the reins tighter everywhere. 
He was building a large house on the hill, and was 
also within a month of his wedding-day. It was rather 
too soon to begin to use capital in this fashion, and it 
pinched him a little. So he pinched others. 

He was supreme master of the Ellicott Works. 
Moreover, the people in the town began to look up 
to him. His advice was sought on various topics, from 
real estate to railroad stock. Drowsy old men nodded 



 

sagaciously, with their eyes half closed. Miss Ellicott 
plumed herself upon her conquest, and proudly dis- 
played her diamond ring. The field before him looked 
so fair with its ripening yellow harvest ! 

But Stephen Dane peered into the dusky, impenetra- 
ble desert, and tortured himself with vain questionings. 



 


STEPHEN DANE was in a good mood to listen to 
John Gilbert that night. He didn't exactly 
understand what Gilbert was driving at with his " right 
of labor." The tyranny of employers appeared more 
tangible. But how the reform was to be made, how 
workmen were to acquire shops of their own, com- 
fortable homes, leisure for reading and recreation, an 
occasional journey, and some of the pleasures of life, 
he did not clearly see. Indeed, to tell the truth, he 
had been considerably muddled, whether it was owing 
to Gilbert's lack of clearness or his own dull brain. 

Joe had playfully stretched her arms across the door 
to bar him in. 

"I don't see what you are off for every night," she 
had said with girlish petulance. 

"Don't you? Well, I do. It's a man's business, 
and women haven't the brains to understand it." 

Some of the new theories. He did not know then 
that he had taken up the wrong end by undervaluing 
women. 



W O, they haven't!" snapped Joe. "They've brains 
enough to understand when they're left at home alone 
night after night." 

He made no reply, but turned away. Joe watched 
him down the lane, pouted a little, and then ran into 
Sally Fawcett's for a good gossip. 

Stephen went to the Star. It was a rather better 
class tavern than the one his father frequented, but 
bad enough, though it boasted a reading-room. Two 
or three tables were on the side opposite the bar, con- 
taining a few stray newspapers, and generally occupied 
by a motley group, who played " Seven up " and 
"Euchre." Some of the more ambitious had organized 
a Club, and of these John Gilbert was leader. 

He was a little, nervous, hungry-looking man, with 
restless eyes and a great sallow forehead, the sandy 
hair being very thin on the top, which seemed to add 
to its height. He had long, angular arms, bony, blood- 
less fingers, and was much given to gesticulating. 
Like many another reformer, he had a chronic quar- 
rel with the world. He saw its faults and wrongs, 
and held them up to the indignation of others ; but he 
could not seem to get hold of the great cure for these 
evils. 

The sanded floor was ornamented with pools of 
tobacco juice, stumps of cigars, and charred matches. 
There was a vile odor in the place, liquoy, smoke, and 
unclean men each adding their mite. Somehow, it 



went against Stephen Dane, and he lingered in the 
doorway many moments. 

"Hillo, Dane ! " said a rather thick, unsteady voice. 
" Come in and treat, old fellow ! " 

" Treat yourselves ; " and Dane threw some loose 
change towards him and the few stragglers around. 

"You needn't be so huffy," was the reply, as the 
man scrambled on the floor for the money. 

John Gilbert came up the street. He had a peculiar 
uneasy gait, and was continually fumbling with his 
hands. 

"Well, Dane," was his salutation, accompanied by a 
brief nod, " what's the news ? " 

" Don't apply to me ; " and Stephen gave a short, 
forced laugh. 

"Why not? Doesn't Thomas Vennard, Esquire, 
keep the world going straight? If it swerved the mil- 
lionth of an inch on its axis, we should hear of it. 
Business pretty good ? " 

" Good enough with him, and always will be," was 
the half-sullen rejoinder. 

"You're right there, Dane. Vennard and that crew 
are always prosperous men, let the world go as it will. 
Now, why should they have all the good luck ? " 

"I don't know, I'm sure, "said Stephen, grimly. 

" They shouldn't. If God made men, which I some- 
times question., he didn't mean one should be a slave to 
the other. And it amounts to just that, Dane. You 




belong to Vennard about as much as a negro slave to 
his master. I'm opposed to slavery of any kind. I 
say one man hasn't any right to lord it over another. 
Don't you s'pose to-night that \ have as much brains as 
Thomas Vennard ? " 

Judging from looks, allowing one's forehead was 
filled with brains, a great deal more, thought Stephen 
Dane. And yet he was not quite sure but quality, as 
well as quantity, had something to do with it. So he 
only nodded a half assent. 

 "Well, why am not I a rich man ? If I had chosen," 

and the speaker stretched up to his utmost capacity, 

"I might have ground the flesh and blood of my fel- 
low-creatures into gold. It's only just turning a vice 
little tighter every day. Some one groans, to be sure ; 
who cares? Here comes Thomas Vennard to look at 
Reai'don's share of the Works. Things were going to 
the dogs, sharp. It looked worse than it was. No one 
was there to bid against him, and Ellicott's an old fool. 
'Now,' says my gentleman, 'you'll all have to stand 
round. Any man that I can't buy may go to the 
devil. And those I do buy will have a long row to 
hoe, I can tell you. No fooling with me.' Now, 
what is the result?" 

Stephen Dane ground his teeth, but made no reply. 

"You work twice as hard as before, and get the same 
pay. The profit goes into the pocket of T. Vennard. 
And if one man of you dares to say his soul's his own, 



 

what then? Off he marches. What can a poor man 
do ? Here's his family starving if he is out of work a 
week. I say, Capital is the greatest tyrant in the world. 
It fights labor down to the lowest point, and chains it 
there. It means to keep workmen ignorant. Educa-
