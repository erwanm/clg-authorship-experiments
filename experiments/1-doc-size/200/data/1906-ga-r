Not only had he no longer the courage to witness 
their misery, but his fortune and his career were 
at stake. His entire capital was invested in the 
company he had founded, and he had failed in 
his embassy to Japan — to the keenest mortification of the Tsar and the jubilance of his enemies. 
If he left the Emperor's northeastern dominions 
unreclaimed and failed to rescue the Company 
from its precarious condition, he should hardly 
care to return to St. Petersburg. 

Dona Concha had listened to this eloquent harangue — they sat alone at one end of the long 
sala while Luis at the other toiled over letters to 
the Governor and his father advising them of the 


formidable honor of the Russian's visit — in exactly the temper he would have chosen. Her fine 
eyes had melted and run over at the moving tale 
of the sufferings of the servants of the Company 
— until his own had softened in response and he 
had impulsively kissed her hand ; they had dilated 
and flashed as he spoke of his personal apprehensions ; and when he had given her a practical 
explanation of his reasons for coming to California she had given him advice as practical in 
return. 

He must withhold from her father and the Governor the fact of his pressing need; they were 
high officials with an inflexible sense of duty, and 
did all they could to enforce the law against trad- 
ing with foreigners. He was to maintain the 
fiction of belting the globe, but admit that he had 
indulged in a dream of commercial relations — for 
a benefit strictly mutual — between neighbors as 
close as the Spanish and Russians in America. 
This would interest them — what would not, on the 
edge of the world? — and they would agree to lay 
the matter, reinforced by a strong personal plea, 
before the Viceroy of Mexico ; who in turn would 
send it to the Cabinet and King at Madrid. 
Meanwhile, he was to confide in the priests at the 



 

Mission. Not only would their sympathies be 
enlisted, but they did much trading under the very 
nose of the government. Not for personal gain 
— they were vowed to a life of poverty; but for 
their Indian converts, and there were twelve hundred at the Mission of San Francisco, they would 
wink at many things condemnable in the abstract. 
He had engaged to visit them on the morrow, and 
he must take presents to tempt their impersonal 
cupidity, and invite them to inspect the rest of 
his wares — which the Governor would be informed he had been forced to buy with the Juno 
from the Yankee skipper, D'Wolf, and would rid 
himself of did opportunity offer. 

Rezanov had never received sounder advice, 
and had promptly accepted it. Now, as he re- 
flected that it had been given by a girl of sixteen, 
he was divided between admiration of her precocity and fear lest she be too young to keep a 
secret. Moreover, there were other considerations. 

Eezanov, although in his earher years he had 
so far sacrificed his interests and played into the 
hands of his enemies, in avoiding the too em- 
barrassing partiality of Catherine the Great, had 
nevertheless held a high place at court by right 



 

of birth, and been a man of the world always; 
rarely absent from St. Petersburg during the 
last and least susceptible part of the imperial 
courtesan's life, the brief reign of Paul, and the 
two years between the accession of Alexander 
and the sailing of the Nadeshda. Moreover, 
there was hardly another court of importance 
in Europe with which he was not familiar, and 
few men had had a more complete experience of 
life. And the life of a courtier, a diplomat, a 
traveller, noble, wealthy, agreeable to women by 
divine right, with active enemies and a horde of 
flatterers, in daily contact with the meaner and 
more disingenuous corners of human nature, is 
not conducive to a broad optimism and a sweet 
and immutable Christianity. Rezanov inevitably 
was more or less cynical and blase, and too long 
versed in the ways of courts and courtiers to 
retain more than a whimsical tolerance of the 
naked truth and an appreciation of its excellence 
as a diplomatic manoeuvre. Nevertheless, he was 
by nature too impetuous ever to become under any 
provocation a dishonest man, and too normally a 
gentleman to deviate from a certain personal 
code of honor. He might come to California with 
fair words and a very definite intention of annexing it to Enssia at the first opportunity, but he 
was incapable of abusing the hospitality of the 
Arguellos by making love to their sixteen-year- 
old daughter. Had she been of the years he 
had assumed he would have had less scruple 
in embarking upon a flirtation, both for the pas- 
time and the use he might make of her. A Spanish beauty of twenty, still unmarried, would be 
more than his match. But a child, however precocious, inevitably would fall in love with the first 
uncommon stranger she met; and Rezanov, less 
vain than most men of his kind, and with a fundamental humanity that was the chief cause in his 
efforts to improve the condition of his wretched 
promuschleniki, had no taste for the role of heart- 
breaker. 

But the girl had proved her timeliness, would, 
if trustworthy, be of further use in inclining her 
father and the Governor toward such of his designs as he had any intention of revealing; and 
weighing carefully his conversations with her, he 
was disposed to believe that she would screen and 
abet him through vanity and love of intrigue. 
After the dinner, in the seclusion of the sala, he 
had taken pains to explore for the causes of her 
mental maturity. Concha had told him of Don 



 

Jose Argiiello's ambition that his children in 
their youth should have the education he had 
been forced to acquire in his manhood; he had 
taught them himself, and notwithstanding his 
piety and the disapproval of the priests, had permitted them to read the histories, travels, and 
biographies he received once a year from the 
City of Mexico. Eezanov had met Madame de 
Stael and other has bleus, and given them no 
more of his society than politeness demanded, 
but although astonished at the amount of information this young girl had assimilated, he found 
nothing in her manner of wearing her intellectual 
crown to oifend his fastidious taste. She was 
wholly artless in her love of books and of 
discussing them; and nothing in their contents 
had disturbed the sweetest innocence he had ever 
met. Of the little arts of coquetry she was mistress by inheritance and much provocation, but 
her unawakened inner life breathed the simplicity 
and purity of the elemental roses that hovered 
about her in his thoughts. Her very unsusceptibility made the game more dangerous ; if it piqued 
him — and he aspired to be no more than human — 
he either should have to marry her, or nurse a 
sore spot in his conscience for the rest of his 




life; and for neither alternative had he the least 
relish. 

He dismissed the subject at last with an impatient shrug. Perhaps he was -a conceited ass, 
as his English friends would say; perhaps the 
Governor would be more amenable than she had 
represented. No man could forecast events. It 
was enough to be forearmed. 

But his thoughts swung to a theme as little disburdening. His needs, as he had confided to 
Concha, were very pressing. The dry or frozen 
fish, the sea-dogs, the fat of whales, upon which 
the employees of the company were forced to 
subsist in the least hospitable of climes, had ravaged them with scorbutic diseases until their numbers were so reduced by death and desertion 
there was danger of depopulation and the consequent bankruptcy of the Company. Since 
June of the preceding year until his departure 
from New Archangel in the previous month, he had 
been actively engaged in inspection of the Company's holdings from Kamchatka to Sitka: reforming abuses, establishing schools and libraries, 
as well as measures to protect the fur-bearing 
animals from reckless slaughter both by the 
promuschleniki and marauding foreigners; punishing and banishing the worst offenders against 
the Company's laws; encouraging the faithful, 
and sharing hardships with them that sent 
memories of former luxuries and pleasures 
scurrying off to the realms of fantasy. But his 
rule would be incomplete and his efforts end in 
failure if the miserable Eussians and natives in 
the employ of the Company were not vitalized by 
proper food and cheered with the hope of its permanence. 

In Santiago's story of the Russian visitor's 
achievements and status there was the common 
mingling of truth and fiction the exalted never 
fail to inspire. Rezanov, although he had accomplished great ends against greater odds, was too 
little of a courtier at heart ever to have been a 
prime favorite in St. Petersburg until the accession of a ruler with whom he had something in 
common. A dissolute woman and a crack-brained 
despot were the last to appreciate an original and 
independent mind, and the seclusion of Alexander 
had been so complete during the lifetime of his 
father that Rezanov had barely known him by 
sight. But the Tsarovitz, enthusiastic for reform 
and a passionate admirer of enterprise, knew of 
Rezanov, and no sooner did he mount his gory
