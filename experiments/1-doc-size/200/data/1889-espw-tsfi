believers a right as clear as the ecstasy of an 
aged saint at the communion table. 

There is no reason, in the nature of things, 
why a man should not question the benevo- 
lence of God. This may be done as honestly 
(I do not say as intelligently), and it may be 
done as honorably, as to question the good- 
nature of the Czar, or the poetic rank of Mil- 
ton, or the disposition of any other being superior 
to the questioner. 

God is an unknown force. He is expressed 
to us through facts. It is our right to interpret 
the nature of that force through these 

facts. It is our duty to exercise this right in 
a manner worthy of a right so solemn, of facts 
so grave, of a force so vast. 

Human impressions are of a singularly limited 
reliability, but if there is one which can 
be said to be trustworthy, it is that people 
know when they suffer. In the infinitely 
complicated system of pain and pleasure that gov- 
erns this world we find, I premise, the 
emphatic predominance of pain. Did we not re- 
member that there have been great teachers 
who deny (as there are those who admit) this, 
and that they have found important and noble 
disciples, we might presume that none but a 
shallow or selfish nature could fail to be aware 
of this predominance. 

There are two ways of viewing such a system. 
It is natural to be chiefly struck with 
the sadness of it. It is possible to be chiefly 
moved by the error in it. It is thought by 
many people — the world contains no better — 
that the latter is the natural, as it should be 
the habitual, avenue by which an upright intelligence 
ought to approach the facts of life. 
This I doubt. It seems to me rather that 
it is mainly by its perception of pain that a 
limited or created nature can constitute itself 
the appraiser of blame ; and that precisely in 
proportion to the purity of a soul must the 
misery of a sight appeal in advance of the 
guilt of it. " I want," said the villain, in a 
thoughtful story, to the unsuccessful clergyman, 
who was opening his Testament upon 
him, — "I want to talk with a man whose 
first impulses are always warm towards the 
worst of men. Your best thoughts seem to 
be your second thoughts." "Do you know 
what keeps the gin palaces open ? " cried the 
pure and consecrated Robertson. " Misery ! 
The miserable go there to forget." 

I should wish, however, to add that I believe 
so thoroughly in the reality of what we call 
sin, that I shall have nothing to say of it here 
as a disconnected fact in the human economy, 
but, in speaking of the miseries of life, shall 
class it, first and finally, as the greatest human 
misery that we know anything about. 

There will be readers of an essay like this to 
whom it will seem that the uncandidness of 
unnecessary gloom pervades it, and that the 
distresses of life, upon which it is always
possible to look from at least two sides, are
presented with unfair emphasis. Be it said, once 
for all, that the writer is not unaware of the 
absence from this discussion of certain genial 
aspects of the world's mystery, nor of the 
sliohtness with which others are brought forward. 
It is my intention, at this time, to leave 
the task of urging these aspects to other 
hands. We are perhaps all of us more familiar 
with their force than with that of argument 
wrested from the reluctance of fate. Let it be 
ours, just now, to see what can be said for human 
life upon its darkest side. Let us look, 
for once, at the divine, as we often do at the 
human problem, and, taking things at their 
worst, see what our chances are. We do this, 
in the one case, for good cheer's sake. For 
good cheer's sake I ask to be trusted in saying
we may do it in the other, too. 

Further, I urge, especially, that we owe it to 
our faith to make it less easy than it is for 
shrewd atheists to say, " Those who believe in 
a God of love must close their eyes to the phenomena
of life, or garble the universe to suit 
their theory" 

It not being our object to furnish a full 
index, or even a concordance, to the miseries 
of mankind, I have selected only three avenues, 
from which, with merciful brevity, to 
approach our problem. 

Let us review for a moment our impressions 
of the Creator, as received through the mani- 
festations of natural law. 

Nature is orderly, wise, beautiful, mysterious, 
terrible, remorseless, cruel. Surrender 
yourself to her awful moods. Test her at her 
tenderest. Try her at her strongest. Shall 
we bask in her midsummer sun ? It is a fire 
from which we must guard ourselves as if 
from the very glory of an offended God. 
Would we have the iron of her snows in our 
blood ? It is at our peril that they do not 
pierce our hearts. If the eternal resurrection 
of her spring does not pour freshets on our 
homes and mildew on our seeds, we kneel to 
thank her. If the red flags of her autumn 
wave no signals of disease or death about our 
firesides, we draw our held breath for another 
cycle of her seasons, and trust her still. She 
bestows the harvest at the chances of the 
famine. She gives her shine on condition of 
her storm. She blazons with beauty the heavens 
in which the bolt lurks to strike us down. 


She stimulates our courage by her seas. She 
forms our fortitude by her deserts. She creates 
our nations by her mountains. The ava- 
lanche, the shipwreck, and the sirocco are the 
cost. Behind every blessing she hides its 
penalty. Beneath every faculty of mind and 
body she secures its denial. Every bestowal 
is a danger. Acceptance measures bereave- 
ment. Possession is the gauge of loss. 

" Life," says a " scientific " historian, " is 
one long tragedy ; creation is one great 
crime." 

The holder of happier faiths must at least 
confess that the mass of evidence, in the great 
trial of Nature before the bar of man, is vo- 
luminous and stern. Forever the temperament 
will select for itself, and certain points in the 
case will intensify the prcejudicia with which 
each of us comes to the hearing. There are 
some minds for which the gentlest caprice of 
the accused can never blot the memory of 
sternly isolated facts in her history. There 
are nicely poised perceptions to which the 
dark corners of her past are always unveiled. 
There are tenderly balanced sympathies for 
which no personal immunity from infliction 

can muffle the wail of recorded anguish. It is 
probably through a small, finely varied, and 
strictly characteristic collection of illustrations 
that each of us practically views a subject like 
this. Is Nature merciful ? It may be natural 
for you to give the historic answer, — to turn 
to ages when the world existed only for the 
propagation of monstrous animal growths, 
that breed, attack, rend each other, die, and 
give place to the next phase of apparently 
purposeless suffering. You recall primitive 
man, who dwelt in caves, like cubs ; who was 
without intelligible speech or human sympathy, 
or the decency of any wild beast known 
to the observation of science. Or you think 
of the highly develoj)ed savage, whose language 
resembled the hissing of serpents ; or of 
him, still ascending in the type, who fed upon 
the quivering flesh of live elephants, cultivated 
what is known as tribal marriage, and buried 
his dead with awful laughter ; or of him whose 
war-phrase, being interpreted, signifies, " Let 
us go and eat that nation." Or you point to 
cities that confide in a crater, and in an hour 
are seething into lava, like the inorganic rock ; 
or to those waste places where famine has 

preceded the traveler, and where the starved 
corpses of entirely vanished communities offer 
him their gaunt hospitality. 

Is Nature merciful ? It may be that your 
impulse gives the poetic answer. You turn 
the query over to the tiger in the jungles, the 
death within the fruit, the venom in the 
thicket, the poison in the flower, the wreck 
beneath the sea, the plague upon the air. To 
many readers and lovers of Frederick Robertson 
his awful illustration of the ichneumon fly 
will stand apart in their minds, and reply for 
them with the convincing vividness by which
