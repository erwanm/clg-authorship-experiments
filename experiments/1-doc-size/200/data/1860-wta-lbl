his Sunday school lesson. 

" I wasn't speaking of fun. Up to the time I 
went to sleep last night I was thinking how I 
should make money ; this morning, the first Ards 
I saw when I opened the Testament to get my 
Sunday school lesson, were, ' For what is a man 
profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and 
lose his own soul ? "

" I guess you had the nightmare last night, and 
have got the blues this morning," said John, trying 
to get up a laugh, in which, however, he did not 
succeed very well, for it is hard, even for a tol- 
erably well-disrposed boy, to make fun of serious 
things. 

" I mean just what I say, John ; you needn't 
laugh. I feel that we have something else to 



 

live for besides money. It is a very pleasant 
thing to make money " 

" Little by little," added John, adopting his 
brother's favorite motto. 

" But I wouldn't be a rich man, if I had to be 
as mean and selfish as old â€” no matter who. 
He is poorer than I am now, with his hundreds 
of thousands. I mean to lay up good prin- 
ciples " 

"little by little," interpolated John. 

" Little by little, if you please ; but even a 
little every day will make a good man one of 
these days. A good thought every day will make 
a man rich in good principles ; at any rate, my 
book says so." 

" How can a fellow help thinking- of the boat, 
if it is Sunday ? " 

'' We must try to think of our lesson, and 
when we go to church, of what the minister says. 
I am going to try and not think of the Fawn 
again till I wake up to-morrow morning." 

" I am willing to try, but it's no use. I wish 
Sunday was over, and Monday had come." 



 

How many boys and girls have thought the 
same thing ! That Sunday, whose moments seemed 
so heavy, was a golden opportunity which may 
have passed never to be recalled. We are in- 
debted to the still hours of the quiet Sabbath, to 
the leisure moments of our daily life, nay, to the 
sleepless couch of pain and suffering, and to the 
bitter time of woe and bereavement, for some of 
the best and truest thoughts which illuminate our 
mortal pilgrimage, and which give birth to our 
good resolutions. A single instant may produce 
an impression upon the heart which shall last to 
the end of life. 

The words of the Scripture which Paul had 
read and heard read a hundred times, without 
feeling the tremendous truth they contain, were 
now full of meaning. They seemed to connect 
themselves with his individual future, and to have 
produced an impression which the excitement of 
possessing the new boat could not overcome. He 
was in the right frame of mind to receive such 
an impression, and it had an important influence 
on all his subsequent career. 



 

As the family seated themselves at the break- 
fast table, Mrs. Duncan improved the opportunity 
to enlarge upon the duties we owe to ourselves 
and to others, in connection with the Sabbath 
day. It is true that John's levity occasionally 
detracted from the effect of the lesson ; but it was 
not wholly lost, even upon that wayward youth. 

Paul struggled hard with his thoughts during 
the day, and he was surprised, when night came, 
to find how successful he had been. It had been 
a good day to him, and he had profited by the 
instruction it afforded him ; for the first step 
towards moral or spiritual improvement is to 
fasten the mind earnestly upon some moral or re- 
ligious topic. 

Long before the sun rose the next morning, 
Paul and John were on the beach. And when 
Mrs. Duncan rang the bell out the window for 
them to come to breakfast, they had dug a bucket 
of olams, and had prepared the Fawn for her first 
trip down the bay. 

" You won't be anxious about us now, mother, 



 

for we have a boat that can't sink," said Paul, as 
he took the luncheon prepared for them. 

"I shall feel easier now." 

" Besides, you know we have two good berths 
on board the boat, and we should be just as 
comfortable, if out all night, as though we were in 
our own beds up stairs." 

" That may be, but I hope you will never stay 
out all night, when you can help it." 

'' We shall not, mother ; you may depend upon 
it ; but we might get aground ; or the wind might 
die out, and the Fawn is too large to be rowed up." 

" I shan't worry about you, if I can help it, for 
I know you are very careful, Paul." 

The boys hastened down to the boat, and Mrs. 
Duncan went out upon the bluff to see them off. 
The wind blew fresh from the south-west when 
they started, and the Fawn went out under jib 
and mainsail, only ; but even with this sail, she 
flew like a racehorse over the waters. 

"Shall I hoist the foresail, Paul?" asked John. 

" I think not ; she is doing very well." 



 

" But she will do better with the foresail." 

" Let well enough alone." 

" I want to see her do her best." 

" I have promised mother a hundred times that 
I would be careful ; and if she should see us put 
on all sail in this wind, though there might not 
be any danger, she would think we were going 
straight to the bottom. We will not hoist the 
foresail." 

This answer satisfied the impatient boy, and 
in a short time they reached the perch ground ; 
but either there were no fish there, or they had 
not got the hang of the new boat ; for the fisher- 
men could hardly get a bite. After trying for an 
hour, and catching only half a dozen small perch, 
the boys became disgusted with their ill luck, 
and it required but little persuasion on the part 
of John to induce Paul to get up the anchor, and 
go farther down the bay. 

An hour's sail brought them to a reef of rocks, 
which was quite a noted locality with the fisher- 
men. The Fawn was anchored in a safe place, 




and the young fishermen threw over their lines. 
Better success attended their efforts here, and in 
three hours they had caught eight dozen fine 
perch, besides ten handsome rock-cod. 

While they were fishing under the lee of the 
rocks, they had scarcely noticed that the wind had 
been steadily increasing, and that it was pro- 
ducing a heavy sea in the bay. 

" We shall have a chance to find out what 
kind of a sea boat the Fawn is," said Paul, as 
he weighed the anchor. 

"I am glad of it," replied John.
