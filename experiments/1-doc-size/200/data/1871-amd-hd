" and will give good satisfaction. Your friend can- 
not do better." 

Mr. Strong and Sarah came down one Saturday. 
He had " heard that you could get a pretty fair me- 
lodeon for fifty dollars, and Sarah would be wanting 
a new gown by and by, and ribbons and things 

" O, I will go without them all ! " Sarah exclaimed, 
in a tremor of excitement. " Why, it is almost as 
large as the one in church, and it is lovely. I would 
rather earn the twenty dollars some way." 

" I don't know what has come over the girl," said 
Mr. Strong, " but she always does manage to have 
her own way. She is a good girl, though, and her 
larnin' hasn't spoiled her a bit." 

" I cannot make him say every word just right," 
Sarah whispered, blushingly ; " but he has given up 
a good many of the old-fashioned habits. It is so 
nice to feel that you are a little like cultivated 
people." 

So Sarah succeeded in getting her melodeon after 
much patient talking. 

" She was so good and sweet about it," Kathie said, 
afterward. " Her whole heart was in it, yet she did 



 

not tease, and was not cross. And how wonderfully 
she has improved ! Mamma, I think her quite a 
good-looking girl." 

" That is exactly it, Kathie, good-looking ; and 
often that is really better than beauty." 

One morning Lou Eossiter surprised them with an 
astounding piece of news. " Belle Hadden is mar- 
ried," she announced, " and there is quite a romance 
about it. She met a French count in Baltimore, who 
pretended to be very rich, and the affair culminated 
in a grand wedding." 

" And he turned out to be somebody's valet," inter- 
polated Sue. 

" Not quite so bad as that ; but he was poor, and 
dreadfully in debt, and very angry that ma'm'selle 
had no dowry. So they quarrelled, and Belle went 
back to her mother." 

" What a sad thing ! " was Emma's comment. 

"Moral: Beware of French counts," added some 
one else. 

Kathie missed Aunt Kuth everywhere, and, most 
of all, in the garden when spring came. It did not 
seem half as delightful to her to work alone, for Mrs. 
Alston could not be out a great deal with her daugh- 



 

ter; and Kathie, being much engrossed with her 
studies, turned the matter over to Mr. Morrison. 

Ethel's father had gone West to claim his tract of 
government land and settle upon it. He was very 
well and prospering nicely. 

Several of the larger girls in school would graduate 
this year, and leave. That was another sad thing for 
Kathie. 

" There are so many changes all the time," she said, 
disconsolately, to Uncle Robert. " I believe I would 
like to be a little child again, or a woman." 

" You cannot be the child, but you are going rap- 
idly to the other bound. And I shall be very sorry 
to lose my bright little fairy." 

"It is so strange, - - all the life, and the going on, 
and the being something to-day that you were not 
yesterday. It puzzles me. I feel at times as if I 
hardly dared to take a step." 

" God gives us grace and strength, my darling, if 
we ask of him. And if we keep in the shadow of his 
great love, we cannot go very far astray." 

There was a certain thoughtful intentness in Ka- 
thie's eyes that was still more question than satis- 
faction. 



 

" Is the puzzle there yet, little one ? " asked Uncle 
Eobert, kindly. 

" It is about the fruit, Uncle Kobert. When I am 
very happy and in the midst of pleasure I am afraid 
I do not think of it, and when the enjoyment is over 
the work looks a little bit hard. But I don't 
want to live a barren, useless life, or a purely self- 
ish one." 

" My dear, it is not the fruit season yet with you, 
but rather spring and the planting-time. And in the 
Lord's gardening there is much for delight and orna- 
ment and refreshment. If we looked at the duties 
only, I am afraid we should become cold and rigid ; 
so he wills that we shall have the pleasures as well, 
only the idleness must not unfit us for work." 

Kathie tried with a very earnest heart. There 
were many discouragements with herself, to be sure . 
but it is step by step in this life, and not a wide 
going from one phase to another. 

The nearer Kob came to the end of the term the 
more glowing his accounts were. " I have worked 
like a Trojan," he wrote to his uncle, " but I have 
achieved something by it. I am going in strong for 
one of the prizes, and I have the Latin oration. I 



 

want you and mother to come, for I think you may 
justly be a little proud of me now." 

" And we must surely go,' said Uncle Robert. 

It so happened that Mrs. Wilder's school closed at 
the same time this year. 

" It is too bad,' Kathie declared, " but I would a 
great deal rather have you go to Clifton Hall, though 
ours will be very much nicer than last year. But 
Rob must not be disappointed." 

They did have a very appreciative and quite a 
large audience. The graduating class acquitted 
themselves finely, and reflected much credit upon 
Mrs. Wilder. There were bouquets and compliments, 
and satisfaction was expressed in every form. Quite 
a number of the girls were invited to Mrs. Coleman's 
afterward. Kathie had been delegated to ask Mr. 
Laugdon. 

" It is not a real party," Sue said, " but a little 
supper and a little talk." 

So Mr. Langdon and Kathie called for Emma, who 
looked very neat and simple in her white dress. 

" You take your honors very meekly, Miss Lauris- 
ton," Mr. Langdon said. " I thought you one of the 
stars of the occasion." 



 



" 



Because I happened to have a special gift. I did 
not study any harder than the other girls, and in 
some branches I really had superiors." 

" And now are you going to neglect your talents, 
after the fashion of young ladies ? ' 

Emma colored. " It is rather hard to find out what 
to do in this world," she said, slowly. " The women 
who are rich can indulge their tastes, and those who 
are very poor take the first thing that offers, since 
they must work. But it is quite difficult for those 
between."
