Slade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver. 
The legends say that one morning at Rocky Ridge, when he was 
feeling comfortable, he saw a man approaching who had of- 
fended him some days before — observe the fine memory he 
had for matters like that — and, " Gentlemen," said Slade, 
drawing, " it is a good twenty-yard shot — I'll clip the third 
button on his coat ! " Which he did. The bystanders all 
admired it. And they all attended the funeral, too. 

On one occasion a man who kept a little whisky-shelf at 
the station did something which angered Slade — and went 
and made his will. A dav or two afterward Slade came in 
and called for some brandy. The man reached nnder the 
counter (ostensibly to get a bottle — possibly to get something 
else), but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and 
satisfied smile of his which the neishbors had Ions; ago learned 
to recognize as a death-warrant in disguise, and told him to 

"none of that!— pass out the high-priced article." So the 
poor bar-keeper had to turn his back and get the high-priced 
brandy from the shelf; and when he faced around again he 
was looking into the muzzle of Slade's pistol, " And the next 
instant," added my informant, impressively, " he was one of 
the deadest men that ever lived." 

The stage-drivers and conductors told us that sometimes 
Slade would leave a hated enemy wholly unmolested, un- 
noticed and unmentioned, for weeks together — had done it 
once or twice at any rate. And some said they believed he 
did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness, so that 
he could get the advantage of them, and others said they pe- 
lieved he saved up an enemy that way, just as a schoolboy 
saves up a cake, and made the pleasure go as far as it would 
by gloating over the anticipation. One of these cases was 
that of a Frenchman who had offended Slade. To the sur- 
prise of everybody Slade did not kill him on the spot, but let 
him alone for a considerable time. Finally, however, he went 
to the Frenchman's house very late one night, knocked, and 
when his enemy opened the door, shot him dead — pushed the 
corpse inside the door with his foot, set the house on fire and 
burned up the dead man, his widow and three children! I 
heard this story from several different people, and they evi- 
dently believed what they were saying. It may be true, and 
it may not. " Give a dog a bad name," etc. 

Slade was captured, once, by a party of men who intended 
to lynch him. They disarmed him, and shut him up in a 
strong log-house, and placed a guard over him. He prevailed 
on his captors to send for his wife, so that he might have a last 
interview with her. She was a brave, loving, spirited woman. 
She jumped on a horse and rode for life and death. When 
she arrived they letvlier in without searching her, and before 
the door could be closed she Mdiipped out a couple of revolvers, 
and she and her lord marched forth defying the party. And 
then, under a brisk fire, they mounted double and galloped 
away unharmed ! 

In the fulness of time Slade's myrmidons captured his 
ancient enemy Jules, whom they  foimd in a well-chosen 
hi ding-place in thenmote fastnesses of the mountains, gaining 
a precarious liveliliood with his rifle. They brought him to 
Rocky Ilidge, bound hand and foot, and deposited him in the 
middle of the cattle-yard with his back against a post. It is 
said that the pleasure that lit Slade's face when he heard of it 
was something fearful to contemplate. He examined his ene- 
my to see that he was securely tied, and then went to bed, 
content to wait till morning before enjoying the luxury of 
killing him. Jules spent the night in the cattle-yard, and it is 
a region where warm nights are never known. In the morn- 
ing Slade practised on him Math his revolver, nipping the flesh 
here and there, and occasionally clipping oft' a flnger, while 
Jules begged him to kill him outright and put him out of his 
misery. Finally Slade reloaded, and walking up close to his 
victim, made some characteristic remarks and then dispatched 
him. The body lay tliere half a day, nobody . venturing to 
touch it without orders, and then Slade detailed a party and 
assisted at the burial himself. But he first cut oft" the dead 
man's ears and put them in his vest pocket, where he carried 
tliem for some time with great satisfaction. That is the story 
as I have frequently heard it told and seen it in print in Cali- 
fornia newspapers. It is doubtless correct in all essential par- 
ticulars. 

In due time we rattled up to a stage-station, and sat down 
to breakfast with a half-savage, half-civilized company of 
armed and bearded mountaineers, ranchmen and station em- 
ployees. The most gentlemanly-appearing, quiet and affable 
officer we had yet fomid along the road in the Overland Com- 
pany's service was the person who sat at the head of the table, 
at my elbow. Never youth stared and shivered as I did when 
I heard them call him Slade ! 

Here was romance, and I sitting face to face with it ! — 
looking upon it — touching it — hobnobbing with it, as it were ! 
Here, right by my side, was the actual ogre who, in fights and 
brawls and various ways, had taken the lives of twenty-six 
human heings, or all men lied about him ! I suppose I was 

the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands 
and wonderful people. 

He was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to 
him in spite of his awful history. It was hardly possible to re- 
alize that this pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of the 
outlaws, the raw-head-and-bloody-bones the nursing mothers 
of the mountains terrified their children with. And to this day 
I can remember nothing remarkable about Slade except that 
his face was rather broad across the cheek bones, and that the 
cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and straight. 
But that was enough to leave something of an effect upon me, 
for since then I seldom see a face possessing those characteristics 
without fancying that the owner of it is a dangerous man. 
The coffee ran out. At least it was reduced to one tin- 
cup ful, and 
Slade was 
about to take 
it when he saw 
that my cup 
was empty. 
He politely of- 
fered to fill it, 
but although 
I wanted it, 
I politely declined. I was afraid he had 
not killed anybody that 
morning, and might be still with 
firm politeness he insisted on filling my cup, and said I had 
traveled all night and better deserved it than he — and while 
he talked he placidly poured the fluid, to the last drop. I 
thanked him and drank it, but it gave me no comfort, for I 
could not feel sure that lie would not be sorry, presently, that 
he had given it away, and proceed to kill me to distract his. 
thoughts from the loss. But nothing of the kind occurred. 
We left him with only twenty-six dead people to account 
for, and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought that in 
so judiciously taking care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table 
I had pleasantly escaped being No. 27. Slade came out to 
the coach and saw us olF, first ordering certain rearrangements 
of the mail-bags for our comfort, and then we took leave of 
him, satisfied that we should hear of him again, some day, and 
wondering in what connection. 


OHAPTEE XI. 

AND sure enough, two or three years afterward, we did 
hear of him again. News came to the Pacific coast 
that the Vigilance Committee in Montana (whither Slade had 
removed from Rocky Ridge) had hanged him. I find an 
account of the atiair in the thrilHng little book I quoted a 
paragraph from in the last chapter — " The Vigilantes of Mon- 
tana; being a Reliable Account of the Capture, Trial and 
Execution of Henry Plummer's Notorious Road Agent Band: 
By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M. T." Mr. 
Dimsdale's chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of 
how the people of the frontier deal with criminals when the 
courts of law prove ineflicient. Mr. Dimsdale makes two re- 
marks about Slade, both of which are accurately descriptive, 
and one of which is exceedingly picturesque : " Those who 
saw him in his natural state only, M'ould pronounce him to be 
a kind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentle- 
man ; on the contrary, those who met him when maddened 
with liquor and surrounded by a gang of armed roughs, would 
pronounce him a fiend incarnate." And this: "From Fort 
Kearney, west, he was feared a great deal more than the Al- 
"niightyP For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expres- 
sion, I will " back " that sentence against anything in literature. 
Mr. Dimsdale's narrative is as follows. In all places where 
italics occur, they are mine : 

After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the Vigi- 
lantes considered that their work was nearly ended. They had freed the 
country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and they deter- 
mined that in the absence of the reguhr civil authority they would estab. 
lish a People's Court where all offenders should be tried by judge and jury. 
This was the nearest approach to social order that the circumstances per- 
mitted, and, though strict legal authority was wanting, yet the people were 
firmly determined to maintain its efficiency, and to enforce its decrees. It 
may here be mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the 
fatal ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished, was the tearing 
in pieces and stamping vpon a writ of this court, foUoired by his arrest of 
the Judge, Alex. Davis, by authority of a presented Derringev, and icith his 
own hands. 

J. A. Slade was limself, we have been informed, a Vigilante ; he openly 
boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew. He was never accused, 
or even suspected, of either murder or robbery, committed in this Territory 
(the latter crime was never laid to his cliarge, in any place) ; but that he 
had killed several men in other localities was notorious, and his bad repu- 
tation in this respect was a most powerful argument in determining his 
fate, when he was finally arrestod for the offence above mentioned. On 
returning from Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking, 
until at last it was a common feat for him and his friends to " take the 
town." lie and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one 
horse, galloping through the streets, shouting and yelling, firing revolvers, 
etc. On many occasions he would ride his horse into stores, break up 
bars, toss the scales out of doors and use most insulting language to par- 
ties present. Just previous to the day of his arrest, he had given a fearful 
beating to one of his followers ; but such was his ii.fiuoice over them that
