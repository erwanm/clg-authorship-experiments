Olmstead came to his relief, and asked how it 
had fared with Pearl's errand to the city. 

They had been very successful. They had 
found a pretty suite of partly furnished rooms in 
a very desirable neighborhood ; and only the home- 







like accessories would need to be added. But 
Mrs. Duane and Rhea were to make a visit at 
Wendover before their essay at housekeeping. 
Rhea would begin with her music and singing les- 
sons as soon as they were settled in the city. 
And only this morning a letter had come from 
Miss Searle, who was pleasantly situated and con- 
tent. 

Olmstead had placed a chair for Miss Disbrowe, 
but she had only rested her hand lightly on the 
back of it. Winchester was glad she did not sit 
down. The slim, graceful figure was like a pic- 
ture. The slight movements were so harmonious, 
the expressions of her fine face so attractive. She 
was like a dream that haunted one, or a strain of 
music that recurred frequently, and one could 
always remember. If he never saw her again, he 
should be able to recall every rare point, the deli- 
cate expressions of her face when she spoke. 

She turned to him presently. It was as if she 
had given him time to recover from the first 
awkwardness of a return to Chester House. 
" We have all been so interested in your 
recovery," she began. " And I am glad you came today ; 
for we go away so soon. We have had a 

;' happy summer in your old house," glancing up 

I with eyes that had a soft radiance in them. 

" He flushed with a sense of shame. How he 


had hated their coming here! He had never been 
near the place, and heretofore it had been his 
Sunday morning ride, with a curious solemnity, 
like that of church-going. " Your old house.' 
How tenderly the words fell from her lips ! 

" I hope you will leave a breath of the happi- 
ness,' he returned almost abruptly. " The place 
will be the better to me because you all have been 
here " — yes, he would include them all, though 
her presence alone would have sanctified it. 

''Will you see Miss Eastwood now, Winchester.? 
This is the longest ride he has taken," turning to 
Pearl in an explanatory fashion, " and I had strict 
injunctions not to tire him out." 

She smiled and went to summon Sabrina. Olmstead paced up and down the room until he heard 
the soft stir of the trailing silken gown in the hall. 
He just spoke as he pressed her hand. 

" Miss Disbrowe," he said, " come and have a 
walk in the old garden." 

Winchester rose and leaned against the chair- 
back. His illness had changed him greatly. He 
looked older, and the dominant imperiousness had 
gone out of his face. His hand that hung against 
the cushion was as white as her own, and much 
thinner. 

" I owe you a boundless debt of gratitude," and 
there was the strain of emotion in his voice. 




" Let me say it before I lose courage, Miss East- 
wood. I have not deserved this recognition at 
your hands. I have been obstinate and wrong-headed 
enough to fight against established facts. 
I was a boor and a bully that time, two years and 
more ago," and his face turned almost swarthy 
with the remembrance. " I sincerely beg your 
pardon. I want you to know that I regret it, that 
I would take back every rude and unjust word if I 
could. I have changed my own opinion of myself 
since then." 

She bowed her head in acknowledgment. He 
stood there in the agonizing mortification of a cul- 
prit, quite at her mercy. True, she had offered to 
be merciful, else he had not dared to come at all. 

She was more beautiful than when he had seen 
her before ; but it was not the beauty that moved 
him, — the kind of princess-like elegance, the high- 
bred face, the perfection of training in every line, 
the subtle coldness that could wither one with its 
glance. And he had once imagined she might 
marry him ! What utter idiocy had possessed 
him.

She caoae straight to the point. Other men 
had asked her in marriage, and this incident was 
no triumph to remember. In fact, just now, she 
did not think of it. 

"You considered the proposal," she began in 





her clear, trained tone. " The Land Improvement 
Company made it in the summer. My guardian 
did not think it exorbitant " — - 

She felt at that moment she would like to offer 
it back for half the money. Something in his air 
and attitude touched, — a kind of manly humility. 

" And I thought if it was to be sold, you should 
have a chance with " — 

That was not quite true. She flushed a little. 

" It is more consideration than I had any right 
to expect. And I am glad to purchase my old 
home at any price. I may — nay, I shall have 
to ask for a little favor in some respects. I con- 
template a change in all my business relations, 
which will take time. And my physician insists 
upon a long holiday. When we have settled this 
I shall go away for some weeks, and not take up 
my new life until later on. But if you do not 
object to this being concluded now" — 

He raised his eyes to her calm, fair face. 

"I should like it finished. We are all going 
away. The house would be shut up." 

"And I may take possession ?"

" Whenever you like." 
" '' Shall I send some one in the city to see Mr. 
Vantine ? " 

" It would be better. Still, if you prefer, I will 
make my part of the bargain secure here and 




now ; then I shall have no opportunity to repent ; " 
Miss Eastwood said in a softer tone. 

" You do not mean — I had thought you did not 
care for Chester House ?" What if she had come 
to a curious regard for it ? 

" I should never be likely to live here. I have 
no tender associations with it. All the interest 
has been in this summer. I do not think it could 
ever be repeated." 

She moved toward the desk, and opened it. As 
she did so her eye caught sight of Pearl and Olm- 
stead wandering about the faded garden. Would 
any other woman ever fit so into the old-time 
pleasance.? What plans had they? Was there 
something between the three that she was shut 
out oi? Would they have a life, a joy quite out- 
side of anything she could give. 

Winchester came over to the desk and wrote. 
It did not look like his usual decisive business 
hand. Then he laid down a check, and she gave 
him a receipt, and signed the other paper. 

"Will you go out with them ? " she asked, mak- 
ing a little gesture. 

"Yes." He picked up his cane, and she saw 
that he walked carefully and with an effort. 

"Would Thursday suit you ? " he asked. "I 
will come over with my lawyer. I will send to 
Mr. Vantine to-day."
