the other shrme was opened, but it went sorely inst the 
heart of the guardians of the mosque. The chief went 
in before the prince, and prayed to Abraham — " O friend of 
God, forgive this intrusion." But when the party were come 
to the shrine of Isaac, in the interior of the mosque, the 
guardians of the mosque begged that they would not enter. 
It was asked, why i and they were told that Abraham was 
goodness itself ; he was full of loving-kindness, and would 
overlook an affront. But Isaac was of a jealous temper, and 
it was very unsafe to provoke him. 'When Ibrahim Pasha 
had tried to enter, he had been driven out by Isaac, and fell 
back as if thunderstruck.' So you see, Tiny, it is true as I 
said ; those people suppose Abraham and his sons are still 
in possession of the cave of Machpelah. The guardians 
groaned when Jacob's tomb was opened." 

"What sort of tombs were in those places ?"

" Built up of stone or marble, about six feet high, and 
covered with hangings of green carpet embroidered with 
gold. At least that is the description of Abraham's. The 
shrines of Isaac and Eebecca were closed with iron gates. 
Jacob and Leah were farther on." 

" What did the people do when the prince and his party 
came out ? " 

"From the mosque? Oh, nothing. The truth is, they 
thought if the old patriarchs did not resent it, all was safe; 
and they were awe-struck. It has been a superstition 
among the Mussulmans, that if anybody ventured to go into 
the very cave itself, even a Mussulman, he would be instantly 
struck with death." 

" How I would like to go there ! " said Dan. 

"And so would I," said my uncle. "There is scarce a 
spot in all the earth that would be so interesting to me. 
For there, beyond all reasonable doubt, lie the remains of 
Abraham and Sarah, of Isaac and Eebecca, and of Jacob and 
Leah ; undisturbed since the day when they were laid to 
rest. Things are pretty well changed outside the cave. The 
field of Ephron the Hittite, which used to be green and fresh 
with its oaks and olives, wild and solitary very likely, is 



covered now, in part, with the black Jewish endosnre wall 
and the inner Mohammedan temple, and the rest builded 
upon with the houses of the town ; but down in the cave
where that old dust lies, all is most likely imchanged. No- 
body at any rate that we are aware of has gone into it for an 
unknown time past. And in the old time, as I told you, 
while sepulchres were honoured as sacred from molestation, 
they were not reverenced as worthy of pilgrimage or as 
shrines of sanctity, like the holy places of modern Christian 
times. They would be just let alone. The Jews give a 
clinging honour and affection to the cave of Machpelah now; 
it is one of their four holy places, as well as one of the 
Mohammedan four. But they are cast out of their possession; and where their great forefather's dust is laid, their 
eyes may not even look. There is a small hole in the wall I 
have described to you, near the entrance ; and at certain 
times it is permitted to the Jews to put their faces to that 
hole and see what they can see through it. And there at 
those times they come, to weep and pray and kiss the stones. 
They can get no nearer." 

" I would never go to Hebron, if I were a Jew," said 
Eliphalet. 

" You do not know a Jew's feeling." 

"And has nobody ever gone into the cavel" Priscilla 
asked 

" They say not ; there is not any tradition of such an attempt, since one that is said to have been made twenty-five 
hundred years ago. Then, the story is, some great king's 
servant went into the cave, and came out blind, deaf, and 
crippled. Since then, they say, the entrance into the cave 
has been closed ; and only one little opening is left. The 
prince and his party saw this opening; it is a small round 
hole in the rock, not a foot across, close by the shrine of 
Abraham. It seemed to open into a dark empty space below, which was supposed to be the real cave of Machpelah; 
and the reason it was left open was, that the holy air might 
come up and do good to the faithful Moslems who breathed 
it. Besides this use, there was a chain with a lamp let down 





by it into the dark space below, to bum there at night. 
Some of the party asked if it could not be lighted then .
The guardians said no ; the saint liked it at night, but would 
object to a lamp lit at noontide." 

"They are very absurd people," said Priscilla. 

"Ignorant, and therefore bigoted," said my uncle. "The 
people of Hebron are particularly bigoted and unruly ; but 
bigotry is a Moslem characteristic. I was lodged with a 
Jewish family when I was in Hebron, and they were exceed- 
ingly kind to me, too. One of them went with me to show 
me the sights of the place ; and we only stopped a few 
minutes to look at the grand old wall that is very likely as 
old as the time of the Jewish kings, and up the marble stair- 
way that leads to the door of entrance ; when a furious Turk 
came out and got a crowd together and drove us away." 

" And you might not even look at the wall ! " said Daniel. 

" Yes, I did, farther off I sat on the roof of the house at 
evening, when the sun was going down, and looked at the 
wall, the black Jewish wall of marble, and at the roof of the 
mosque peeping over it ; while from the top of the minaret 
the call to evening prayer sounded out over the city. Jew 
and Christian are pushed away from Abraham's tomb; and 
strange sounds of a false religion go forth over the cave of 
Machpelah now." 

"What are the other holy places of the Mohammedans, 
uncle Sam ? " 

" Jerusalem, Medina, and Mecca. On Mount Arafat, near 
Mecca, their tradition is that Ishmael was bound for sacrifice ; not Isaac ; and there a sacrifice is killed yearly and a 
sermon is preached ; for which special occasions the grand 
pilgrimage to Mecca is made every year, and caravans used 
to come from east and west, north and south. Seventy 
thousand persons would be in the assembly, and people 
speaking a vast variety of tongues ; all worshipping the false 
prophet." 

" Was the cave of Machpelah a square room, cut out with 
niches, uncle Sami" 

" Nobody certainly knows, Tiny. But I should think not. 



 

Abraham cut probably one niche for Sarah and another for 
himself; and others in process of time were made for Isaac 
and Jacob and their wives. That was all ; and I do not believe 
the cave was much altered from its natural proportions to 
accommodate those few. In ordinary cases, in later times, 
the niches were cut so as to make good use of the room there 
might be ; and in the niches the bodies were laid, dressed 
but not enclosed in coffins. In the case of great people, 
sometimes stone sarcophagi were used. The door of the 
tomb was a heavy stone. The hills' and valleys around 
Jerusalem are full of these rock-hewn sepulchres ; the city 
has not nearly so many houses as tombs. 

" So ' Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the 
field of Machpelah before Mamre;' she was a hundred and 
twenty-seven years old; and she is the only woman men- 
tioned in the Bible who is honoured with the record of ail 
these particulars concerning her ; age, death, and burial" 

" Yet I do not like her much, uncle Sam ? " 

"She has a nobler mention in the 11th chapter of Hebrews ; where she is said to have been a woman of faith. 
She bore a son in her old age, and this blessing was given 
her, ' because she judged Him faithful who had promised.' 
See that you deserve as good a record as Sarah did. Prissy. 
And there is another honourable mention of her, made by 
the apostle Peter. He says she was a good wife, being 
obedient to her husband ; ' whose daughters ye are, as long 
as ye do well.' We would have thought from the story in 
Genesis, that Abraham was a very indulgent husband ; but 
you see here he had reason for it. The Bible does not stop 
to tell us all we would like to know about everybody; never- 
theless, by careful looking we can sometimes find out a good 
deal." 




Sept. 20.— ISAACS WIFK 

" We have the 24th chapter of Genesis to talk about to-day," 
said Priscilla. " We are getting on.", 

"We are not getting on very fast," said Idph. 

"Fast enough," said Dan. 

" There are different ways of getting on," said uncle Sam. 
" But to-day we have to take a wedding journey. The first 
wedding we are told of in history. Abraham was growing 
to be a very old man — towards a hundred and forty years 
old — and he and his son were left alone by Sarah's death. 
Isaac took it hard; the loss of his mother was grievous to 
him ; and as soon as time enough had passed, Abraham bethought him to make arrangements for his son's marriage."
