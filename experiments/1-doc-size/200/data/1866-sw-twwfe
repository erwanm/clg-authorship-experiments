every part of the world. From every part of the world men 
look back at it ; through more and less mist of the atmosphere through which they look." 

" From every part of the world?"  said liph. 

" From every quarter of the world. Do you think such a 
thing would be forgotten by Noah's children ? But as they 
wandered away from other truths, so they lost a great deal 
of this. It is just the distant blue mountain. As you might 
expect, the people who live near the spot where the ark 
rested, have kept the clearest traditions of the matter. They 
all say Armenia was the place. But Noah goes under all 
sorts of names. 

"For instance. One of the best traditions is the Chaldean. An old historian of that nation gives it in this 
way : There was a king of Babylon, the tenth king, called 
Xisuthrus. The god .Kronos told him that on such a day 
a flood would come which would destroy the earth. So he 
bade Xisuthrus build a vessel, stock it with provisions, fill 
it with animals, and take on board all the people that he 
cared about; which Xisuthrus did. He built a ship three 
quarters of a mile long, and more than a quarter of a mile 
broad, which would hold a good deal. The flood came, and 
in process of time went off again. Then Xisuthrus sent out 
birds from his ship, which came back to him. He waited, 
and sent them out a second time. This time they came 



back with mud on their feet. Afterwards he made a third 
trial, and the birds came home no more. Then Xisnthrus 
made an opening in his vessel— it seems to have been an odd 
kind of a ship— and looked out, and found that he was high 
and dry on a mountain in Armenia. So he came forth and 
offered sacrifices to the gods." 

" That is a pretty good story, unde Sam," said Daniel

"Pretty good. The Persians got further off from the 
truth They had it, that the world had grown wicked, and 
it was needful to purify it by bringing a flood of waters over 
all living inhabitants. So the water came down in drops 
as large as the head of a bull, and the flood rose until all 
men were killed. They had no tradition of Noah and the 
ark ; they held that after the flood there was a new creation 
of human creatures. But then, over against this lame story, 
there was a city in Phrygia— in Asia Minor, you know — 
which was named Kihotos, or 'the ark;' and so late as 
the time of the emperor Septimlus Severus — how late was 
that, Liph?" 

" I do not remember, sir, exactly." 

" It was two hundred years after Christ," said Dan ; " the 
time of the fifth persecution of the Christians." 

"Ay," said my unde. "Well, the town I speak of — a 
great trading town of Asia Minor— had a coin struck in 




the time of Severus, having on its face the representation 
of a square box of a vessel, floating on water, with the heads 
of a man and a woman appearing at an opening. On the 




Tessel a bird is perched, and another bird is flying towards 
it with a branch in its claws. Outside of the vessel the 
man and woman are seen again, got out upon dry land, and 
with hands lifted up in attitude of adoration. On some of 
the coins the letters N. O. E. are struck in Greek characters." 

" Why, isn't that extraordinary ?" said Priscilla. 

" It was the custom in that age to have the coins of cities 
relate some point of their religious history. But none came 
SO near the truth as this little town of Apamea. That was 
its later name." 

"Well, uncle Sam ?" said Daniel. 

" I cannot tell you all the stories, my boy. They are all 
over the world. In China they had one in many respects 
very close to the Bible account. Fdh-he is the name of 
Noah there. He escaped, they said, with his wife, three 
sons, and three daughters, from whom the earth was peopled 
again. Dr Qutzlaff saw a beautiful picture in China, which 
showed Noah in his ark, on the waters, the dolphins swimming around, and the dove coming with the olive branch
But in India we find it all mixed up. The god Brama told 
the good man Manu that the flood was coming, and bade 
him build a ship and store it with all kinds of seeds. Then 
Brama took the form of a homed fish, and making the vessel 
fast to himself, he drew it about for a long, long time. At 
last landed it on the loftiest peak of Mount Himerat — in 
the Himalaya range. Then Manu was permitted to create 
a new race of men, who were called Manudsha, or ' bom of 
Manu.' That is the Hindoo story. Then when we come 
over to America, we find a new set of stories," 

" Where, uncle Sam ? " said I, wondering. 

"Among the North American Indians, Tiny— and the 
Mexicans, and the neighbouring nations. They have their 
traditions ; and the old nations of Europe had theirs." 

" The Greeks had a beautiful one," said Dan, " about 
Deucalion." 

" Let us have it, Dan. I don't like to do all the talking." 

"The first race of men were violent and wicked," Dan 
begaoy " and they were punished for their wickedness by a 



 

dreadful rain which flooded everything. But besides the 
rain, the water burst out from all parts of the earth Deucalion was a good man and was saved. He packed all his 
wives and children into a large chest which he had"— 

" It must have been very big ! " said Priscilla. 

— "And went in himself; and just as he was going in, 
came beasts and creeping things and all sorts of creatures 
running to him two by two. So he took them in, and 
Jupiter made them so good and peaceable that they made no 
disturbance, but behaved themselves together to the end of 
the voyage." 

" Well ! " said Priscilla ; " that was a most extraordinary 
chest!" 

" Deucalion's voyage lasted only nine days; then his chest 
came to land on the top of Mount Parnassus — that is a 
famous mountain in Greece, Tiny. Deucalion and his wife 
came out, and seeing the earth was left without inhabitants, 
they went to consult the oracle at Delphi as to what was to 
be done." 

" But what is an oracle ? " said I. 

"Tiny ought to read history," said LipL 

" The oracles were places where the gods were supposed 
to give answers to the questions of men," my uncle said; "or 
they were the answers themselves. There were many famous 
such places ; Delphi was one, where Apollo was consulted. 
There the answer was delivered through a priestess, who was 
thought to be inspired, and delivered the answer in a fit of 
raving. At other oracles the answers were differently given. 
Go on, Dan." 

" Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha consulted the oracle at 
Delphi, what should be done to repeople the earth; and 
they were told they must throw behind them the bones of 
their grandmother. At first that seemed a perplexing direction; but finally they guessed what it meant. The bones 
of their grandmother were the stones of the earth. So Deucalion and Pyrrha stood and threw stones over their shoulders ; and all he threw became men, and all she threw became women." 



"That is very ridiculous ? " exclaimed Priscilla. "Did 
people believe such stuff? " 

" It is hard to say what people will not believe, when they 
wander away from the truth," said my uncle. " Wise philosophers, of course, did not believe such a fable ; and they did 
not know what was truth ; but groped about in the dark for 
"it, after it had been lost. This legend, you know, belonged 
to the refined and cultivated Greek nation. A great philosopher of modem times had a desire to get to some region 
of the earth that was quite removed from all communication 
with these peoples of Europe and Asia, that may be supposed to have learned from each other. So he travelled off 
and wandered away, till he got among a tribe of savages on 
the banks of the Orinoco, in Western America. And there, 
where certainly the Jews and the Greeks had never taught 
anybody, he was told this story. Once there was a great 
flood that overwhelmed everything; and one man and his wife 
escaped to the top of a certain high mountain and were saved. 
Then, seeing that everybody else was dead, to supply the 
land with inhabitants, they threw over their heads date- 
stones, or the fruit of a palm-tree, which sprung up men and 
women. I suppose, after that, M. Von Humboldt concluded 
he could not get away from traditions of the deluge. 

" How very curious ! " said Dan. " That is good." 

" Humboldt says that the different Mexican nations have 
paintings representing the flood and Noah. There he is 
called Coxcox, and Tezpi, and Teocipactli ; and his wife is 
XochiquezatL And Colhuacen, one of the Mexican mountains, stands for Ararat. Coxcox was saved in a vessel or 
on a raft, they think, with his wife and children, some 
animals and grain. When the waters subsided, Coxcox sent 
out a vulture first, which found so many dead bodies floating about that it did not come back. Then he sent out some 
other birds, and a humming-bird brought him a green branch. 
80 Coxcox, or Tezpi, came out of his vessel. And even in 
the ilji islands there is a tradition of the flood. They say 
that eight persons were saved by the god of the carpenters 
and his head workmen, in two large double canoes ; and
