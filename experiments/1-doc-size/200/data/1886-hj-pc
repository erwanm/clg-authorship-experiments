' I've seen him at Eustace's. I know that you and he 
are as thick as thieves.' 

'He will distinguish himself some day, very much,' 
said Hyacinth, who was perfectly willing, and indeed very 
proud, to be thought a close ally of the chemist's assistant. 

'Very likely very likely. And what will he do with 
you?' the fiddler inquired. 

Hyacinth got up ; the two men looked at each other 
for an instant. ' Do get me two good places in the second 
balcony,' said Hyacinth. 

Mr. Vetch replied that he would do what he could, and 
three days afterwards he gave the coveted order to his 
young friend. As he placed it in his hands he exclaimed, 
' You had better put in all the fun you can, you know ! ' 



BOOK SECOND 



XII 



HYACINTH and his companion took their seats with extreme 
promptitude before the curtain rose upon the Pearl of 
Paraguay. Thanks to Millicent's eagerness not to be late 
they encountered the discomfort which had constituted her 
main objection to going into the pit : they waited for twenty 
minutes at the door of the theatre, in a tight, stolid crowd, 
before the official hour of opening. Millicent, bareheaded 
and very tightly laced, presented a most splendid appear- 
ance and, on Hyacinth's part, gratified a certain youthful, 
ingenuous pride of possession in every respect save a 
tendency, while ingress was denied them, to make her 
neighbours feel her elbows and to comment, loudly and 
sarcastically, on the situation. It was more clear to him 
even than it had been before that she was a young lady who 
in public places might easily need a champion or an 
apologist. Hyacinth knew there was only one way to 
apologise for a ' female,' when the female was attached very 
closely and heavily to one's arm, and was reminded afresh 
how little constitutional aversion Miss Henning had to a 
row. He had an idea she might think his own taste ran 
even too little in that direction, and had visions of violent, 
confused scenes, in which he should in some way distinguish 
himself: he scarcely knew in what way, and imagined him- 




self more easily routing some hulking adversary by an 
exquisite application of the retort courteous than by flying 
at him with a pair of very small fists. 

By the time they had reached their places in the balcony 
Millicent was rather flushed and a good deal ruffled ; but 
she had composed herself in season for the rising of the curtain 
upon the farce which preceded the melodrama and which 
the pair had had no intention of losing. At this stage a 
more genial agitation took possession of her, and she 
surrendered her sympathies to the horse -play of the 
traditional prelude. Hyacinth found it less amusing, but 
the theatre, in any conditions, was full of sweet deception for 
him. His imagination projected itself lovingly across the 
footlights, gilded and coloured the shabby canvas and 
battered accessories, and lost itself so effectually in the 
fictive world that the end of the piece, however , long, or 
however short, brought with it a kind of alarm, like a 
stoppage of his personal life. It was impossible to be more 
friendly to the dramatic illusion. Millicent, as the audience 
thickened, rejoiced more largely and loudly, held herself as 
a lady, surveyed the place as if she knew all about it, leaned 
back and leaned forward, fanned herself with majesty, gave 
her opinion upon the appearance and coiffure of every 
woman within sight, abounded in question and conjecture, 
and produced, from her pocket, a little paper of peppermint- 
drops, of which, under cruel threats, she compelled Hyacinth 
to partake. She followed with attention, though not always 
with success, the complicated adventures of the Pearl of 
Paraguay, through scenes luxuriantly tropical, in which the 
male characters wore sombreros and stilettos, and the ladies 
either danced the cachucha or fled from licentious pursuit ; 



 

but her eyes wandered, during considerable periods, to the 
occupants of the boxes and stalls, concerning several of 
whom she had theories which she imparted to Hyacinth 
while the play went on, greatly to his discomfiture, he being 
unable to conceive of such levity. She had the pretension 
of knowing who every one was ; not individually and by 
name, but as regards their exact social station, the quarter 
of London in which they lived, and the amount of money 
they were prepared to spend in the neighbourhood of 
Buckingham Palace. She had seen the whole town pass 
through her establishment there, and though Hyacinth, 
from his infancy, had been watching it from his own point 
of view, his companion made him feel that he had missed a 
thousand characteristic points, so different were most of her 
interpretations from his, and so very bold and irreverent. 
Miss Henning's observation of human society had not been 
of a nature to impress her with its high moral tone, and she 
had a free off-hand cynicism which imposed itself. She 
thought most ladies were hypocrites, and had, in all ways, a 
low opinion of her own sex, which, more than once, before 
this, she had justified to Hyacinth by narrating observations 
of the most surprising kind, gathered during her career as a 
shop-girl. There was a pleasing inconsequence, therefore, 
in her being moved to tears in the third act of the play, 
when the Pearl of Paraguay, dishevelled and distracted, 
dragging herself on her knees, implored the stern hidalgo 
her father, to believe in her innocence in spite of the cir- 
cumstances which seemed to condemn her a midnight 
meeting with the wicked hero in the grove of cocoanuts. 
It was at this crisis, none the less, that she asked Hyacinth 
who his friends were in the principal box on the left of the 



stage, and let him know that a gentleman seated there had 
been watching him, at intervals, for the past half hour. 

' Watching me ! I like that ! ' said the young man. 
' When I want to be watched I take you with me.' 

' Of course he has looked at me,' Millicent answered, as 
if she had no interest in denying that. ' But you're the one 
he wants to get hold of.' 

'To get hold of!' 

' Yes, you ninny : don't hang back. He may make your 
fortune.' 

' Well, if you would like him to come and sit by you I'll 
go and take a walk in the Strand,' said Hyacinth, entering 
into the humour of the occasion but not seeing, from where 
he was placed, any gentleman in the box. Millicent explained 
that the mysterious observer had just altered his position; 
he had gone into the back of the box, which had consider- 
able depth. There were other persons in it, out of sight ; 
she and Hyacinth were too much on the same side. One 
of them was a lady, concealed by the curtain ; her arm, 
bare save for its bracelets, was visible at moments on the 
cushioned ledge. Hyacinth saw it, in effect, reappear there, 
and even while the play went on contemplated it with a 
certain interest ; but until the curtain fell at the end of the 
act there was no further symptom that a gentleman wished 
to get hold of him. 

' Now do you say it's me he's after ? ' Millicent asked 
abruptly, giving him a sidelong dig, as the fiddlers in the 
orchestra began to scrape their instruments for the interlude. 

' Of course ; I am only the pretext,' Hyacinth replied, 
after he had looked a moment, in a manner which he 
flattered himself was a proof of quick self-possession. The 



 

gentleman designated by his companion was once more at 
the front, leaning forward, with his arms on the edge. 
Hyacinth saw that he was looking straight at him, and our 
young man returned his gaze an effort not rendered the 
more easy by the fact that, after an instant, he recognised 
him. 

' Well, if he knows us he might give some sign, and if 
he doesn't he might leave us alone,' Millicent declared, 
abandoning the distinction she had made between herself 
and her companion. She had no sooner spoken than the 
gentleman complied with the first mentioned of these con- 
ditions ; he smiled at Hyacinth across the house he 
nodded to him with unmistakable friendliness. Millicent, 
perceiving this, glanced at the young man from Lpmax 
Place and saw that the demonstration had brought a deep 
colour to his cheek. He was blushing, flushing ; whether 
with pleasure or embarrassment was not immediately 
apparent to her. ' I say, I say is it one of your grand 
relations ? ' she promptly exclaimed. ' Well, I can stare 
as well as him ; ' and she told Hyacinth it was a ' shime ' 
to bring a young lady to the play when you hadn't so much 
as an opera-glass for her to look at the company. ' Is he 
one of those lords your aunt was always talking about in 
the Plice ? Is he your uncle, or your grandfather, or your 
first or second cousin ? No, he's too young for your grand- 
father. What a pity I can't see if he looks like you !' 

At any other time Hyacinth would have thought these 
inquiries in the worst possible taste, but now he was too
