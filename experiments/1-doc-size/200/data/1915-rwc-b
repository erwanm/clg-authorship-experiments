and undiminished vigour. 

The tall one with the crisp hair and clear, 
grayish eyes he of the three chickens 
was already achieving the third a crisply 
browned bird, fresh from the spit, fragrant 
and smoking hot. At intervals he buttered 
great slices of rye bread, or disposed of an 
entire young potato, washing it down with a 
goblet of red wine, but always he returned 
to the rich roasted fowl which he held, still 
impaled upon its spit, and which he carved 









as he ate, wings, legs, breast falling in steam 
ing flakes under his skillful knife blade. 

Sticky Smith finally pushed aside his drained 
glass and surveyed an empty plate frankly 
and regretfully, unable to continue. He said: 

"I'm going to bed and I'm going to sleep 
twenty-four hours. After that I'm going to 
eat for twenty-four more hours, and then I'll 
be in good shape. Bong soir." 

"Aw, stick around with the push!" remon 
strated Kid Glenn thickly, impaling another 
potato upon his fork and gesticulating with it. 

Smith gazed with surfeited but hopeless 
envy upon Burley's magnificent work with 
knife and fork, saw him crack a seventh bottle of Bordeaux, watched him empty the first 
goblet. 

But even Glenn's eyes began to dull in 
spite of himself, his head nodded mechanically at every mouthful achieved. 

"I gotta call it off, Jack," he yawned. 
"Stick and I need the sleep if you don t. 
So here's where we quit " 

"Let me tell you about that girl," began 
Burley. "I never saw a prettier " But 









Glenn had appetite neither for food nor 
romance : 

"Say, listen. Have a heart, Jack! We 
need the sleep!" 

Stick had already risen; Glenn shoved back 
his chair with a gigantic yawn and shambled 
to his feet. 

"I want to tell you," insisted Burley, "that 
she's what the French call tray, tray 
chick " 

Stick pointed furiously at the fowl: 

"Chick? I'm fed up on chick! Maybe she 
is some chick, as you say, but it doesn't in 
terest me. Goo bye. Don't come battering 
at my door and wake me up, Jack. Be a 
sport and lemme alone " 

He turned and shuffled out, and Glenn followed, his Mexican spurs clanking. 

Burley jeered them: 

"Mollycoddles! Come on and take in the 
town with us !" 

But they slammed the door behind them, 
and he heard them stumbling and clanking 
up stairs. 

So Burley, gazing gravely at his empty 









plate, presently emptied the last visible bottle of Bordeaux, then stretching his mighty 
arms and superb chest, fished out a cigarette, 
set fire to it, unhooked the cartridge-belt and 
holster from the back of his chair, buckled 
it on, rose, pulled on his leather-peaked cap, 
and drew a deep breath of contentment. 

For a moment he stood in the centre of 
the room, as though in pleasant meditation, 
then he slowly strode toward the street door, 
murmuring to himself : "Tray, tray chick. The 
prettiest girl in the world. ... La ploo belle 
fille du monde ... la ploo belle. . . ." 

He strolled as far as the corral down in 
the meadow by the stream, where he found 
the negro muleteers asleep and the mules 
already watered and fed. 

For a while he hobnobbed with the three 
gendarmes on duty there, practicing his kind 
of French on them and managing to under 
stand and be understood more or less prob 
ably less. 

But the young man was persistent; he desired to become that easy master of the 
French language that his tongue-tied comrades believed him to be. So he practiced 
garrulously upon the polite, suffering gendarmes. 

He related to them his experience on ship 
board with a thousand mutinous mules to 
pacify, feed, water, and otherwise cherish. 
They had, it appeared, encountered no sub 
marines, but enjoyed several alarms from 
destroyers which eventually proved to be 
British. 

"A cousin of mine," explained Burley, 
"Ned Winters, of El Paso, went down on the 
steamer John B. Doty, with eleven hundred 
mules and six niggers. The Boches torpedoed 
the ship and then raked the boats. I'd like 
to get a crack at one Boche before I go back 
to God's country." 

The gendarmes politely but regretfully 
agreed that it was impracticable for Burley 
to get a crack at a Hun; and the American 
presently took himself off to the corral, after 
distributing cigarettes and establishing cordial relations with the Sainte Lesse Gendarmerie. 

He waked up a negro and inspected the 








mules; that took a long time. Then he sought 
out the negro blacksmith, awoke him, and 
wrote out some directions. 

"The idea is," he explained, "that when 
ever the French in this sector need mules 
they draw on our corral. We are supposed 
to keep ten or eleven hundred mules here all 
the time and look after them. Shipments 
come every two weeks, I believe. So after 
you've had another good nap, George, you 
wake up your boys and get busy. And 
there'll be trouble if things are not in run 
ning order by tomorrow night." 

"Yas, suh, Mistuh Burley," nodded the 
sleepy blacksmith, still blinking in the after 
noon sunshine. 

"And if you need an interpreter," added 
Burley, "always call on me until you learn 
French enough to get on. Understand, 
George?" 

"Yas, suh." 

"Because," said Burley, walking away, "a 
thorough knowledge of French idioms is 
necessary to prevent mistakes. When in 
doubt always apply to me, George, for only
