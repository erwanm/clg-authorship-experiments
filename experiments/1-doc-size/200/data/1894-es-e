" Not read ? You surprise me. I have 





not seen a magazine in which his name does 
not appear." 

" Precisely," Stitt answered, with that pontifical mien which only a novelist may as- 
sume. " No one reads magazines except " 
and -he raised a finger tragically " except the advertiser." 

At this Lord Cloden looked expectant, 
Mrs. Smithwick perplexed. Myrrha alone, 
her eyes fastened on the Englishman, seemed 
indifferent. But Mr. Stitt, sure of his effect, 
launched forth. 

" The advertiser, you must know, wishes 
his wares to penetrate everywhere. To 
facilitate that penetration, he has his adver- 
tisements written in a lively and engaging 
fashion. Do you imagine for one second 
that he will pay to have those advertisements 
inserted in a periodical whose reading-matter 
is absorbing ? Why, never in the world. He 
wants his wares heralded in magazines in 
which the reading-matter is so soporific, that 
the subscriber will turn to the advertise- 
ments for relief. The editor, who is not 





half as stupid as he looks, is aware of all 
this, and fully aware, too, that it is not the 
subscriber but the advertiser who must be 
coddled. For it is from the latter that profit 
comes. As a consequence, the contributors 
whom he selects are, considered as writers, 
below par, but as anaesthetists they are un- 
rivalled." 

" Anaesthetist, anaesthetist ! what is 
that ? " 

" Lexicographically, dear Mrs. Smithwick, 
an anaesthetist is a gentleman who holds 
chloroform at you until you sink into the 
gentle and innocent sleep of the cradle. 
Colloquially he is one whose literary produc- 
tions make you regard the advertisement of 
a cure for ' That Tired Feeling ' as a wild 
and thrilling thing, that stamp it indelibly 
on your memory, that force you out of sheer 
cussedness to go and purchase the stuff, by 
the quart at that. Oh, believe me, anaesthe- 
tists have their value, and Mr. Howells has 
his ! " 

" Dear, dear ! " exclaimed Mrs. Smith- 





wick, removing as she spoke her elbows 
from the table. " How delightful it is to 
hear men of talent talk ! But come, Myrrha, 
let us leave them to their smoke. They 
mustn't stay long, though," she concluded 
archly. " Must they, Myrrha ?" 

And circling the girl's waist, she almost 
tripped from the room. 

The men had risen. 

" Harris," said the novelist, as he reseated 
himself, "is there any whiskey in the 
house ? Very good, get me a glass of 
brandy, then. You will have some, won't 
you, Lord Cloden ? " 

" No. I never touch it. I would like 
another drop of Apollinaris, though, if I 
might." 

''Yes, my lord. Thank your lordship." 

And Harris poured out the water with the 
solemnity of an augur offering a libation. 
But presently he disappeared, and the earl 
looked up. 

"That is a most ingenious theory of yours 
about the advertiser. It explains so much. 





But does it explain why the public buy the 
magazines ? " 

"The public the public?" Mr. Stitt 
with grand contempt had raised a hand, the 
fingers extended. " But let me ask you how 
many idiots does it take to make a public ? " 

" Ah, yes, I see ! the little guinea-pigs 
again. But do give a stranger and a pilgrim 
some information. Are you living here ? " 

The earl had crossed his legs, lit a cigar- 
ette, and Mr. Stitt promised himself an 
agreeable ten minutes. 

" I ? Good Lord, no ! I only ran down 
for the day. Family matter. I'm off again 
to-morrow. There will be hardly any one 
here for a month yet. Should you come to 
town, I wish you would look me up." 

" Thanks ; you are very good. But tell 
me, I should think these ladies would find it 
rather dull here." 

Mr. Stitt had also crossed his legs; he, 
too, was smoking ; he was at his second 
glass of brandy, and altogether he felt com- 
fortable and expansive. 





" Dull ? Of course. But then, you see, it 
is rather obligatory. Miss Attersol's father 
has been dead hardly a year ; and he died, 
moreover, in er well, what I might call 
rather oddly, don't you know." 

" Ah ! " And the earl manifested such 
civil interest as earls may. 

" Yes ; a burglar got into the room and 
frightened him to death. Then there was 
no end of a rumpus. A chap named Ban- 
croft, a lawyer, who was stopping here, had 
a shy at him ; but Mr. Burglar was one too 
many, he bowled him over and knifed him 
too." 

Lord Cloden raised the Apollinaris to his 
lips. " But the burglar " 

" Oh, he got off ! Bancroft couldn't give 
any description Here, take my handker- 
chief." 

"Thanks, the napkin will do." And the 
earl began mopping at his shirt on which 
some of the Apollinaris had spilled. "By 
the way, I think I will take a drop of that 
brandy." 





Mr. Stitt passed the decanter, and his 
companion filled a little glass. 

"But the lawyer? Didn't you say that 
the burglar killed him ? " 

"No. Thought he did, I fancy. Ban- 
croft was on his feet in no time. You will 
meet him if you remain a day or two. I 
think it's a match between him and " 

" It's my nerves," exclaimed the earl with 
a smile that was its own apology, for the 
glass had fallen from his hand. "A fellow 
doesn't have yellow fever for nothing. Sup- 
pose we join the ladies."

THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE 

" O LORD CLODEN, do permit me ; this is 
Mr. Bancroft."
