of having slipped their guard upon the chancel for 
a moment; he had but turned his head politely, 
though a bit impatiently, to reply to some trivial 
remark of his wife's, when, behold, the preacher 
stood before him. 

Afterwards it was rumored that two or three
persons in the audience had not been taken by surprise 
in this way, but had fully observed the manner of 
the stranger's entrance; yet these persons, when 
they were sought, were difficult to find. There was 
one shabby woman who sat in the gallery among the 




" poor " seats ; she was clad in rusty mourning, and 
had a pale and patient face, quite familiar to the 
audience, for she was a faithful church-goer, and 
had attended Saint Agatha's for many years. It 
came to be said, through the sexton's gossip or 
otherwise, that this poor woman had seen the 
preacher's approach quite clearly, and had been 
much moved thereat; but when some effort was 
made to find her, and to question her on this point, 
unexpected obstacles arose, she was an obscure 
person, serving in some menial capacity for floating 
employers ; she was accustomed to slip in and out of 
the church hurriedly, both late and early, and 
nothing of importance was added from this quarter 
to the general interest which attended the 
eccentricities of the supply. 

The stranger was a man a trifle above the ordinary 
height, of majestic mien and carriage, and 
with the lofty head that indicates both fearlessness 
and purity of nature. As he glided to his place 
behind the lectern, a hush struck the frivolous audi 
ence, as if it had been smitten by an angel's wing : 
such power is there in noble novelty, and in the 
authority of a high heart. 

When had the similar of this preacher led the 
service in that venerable and fashionable house of 
worship? In what past years had his counterpart 
served them? 

Whom did he resemble of the long line of eminent 
clerical teachers with whose qualities this elect 
people was familiar? What had been his history, 
his ecclesiastical position, his social connections? 
It was characteristic of the audience that this last 
question was first in the minds of a large proportion 
of the worshipers. Whence came he ? His name ? 
His titles? What was his professional reputation 
his theology? What were his views on choir 
boys, confessionals, and candles on mission 
chapels and the pauperizing of the poor? 

These inquiries swept through the inner con 
sciousness of the audience in the first moment of 
his appearance. But in the second, neither these 
nor any other paltry queries fretted the smallest 
soul before him. 

The stranger must have had an impressive coun 
tenance ; yet afterwards it was found that no two 
descriptions of it agreed. Some said this thing, 
some said that. To this person he appeared a 
gentle, kindly man with a persuasive manner; to 
that, he looked majestic and commanding. There 



were some who spoke of an authoritative severity 
in the eye which he turned upon them ; but these 
were not many. There were those who murmured 
that they had melted beneath the tenderness of his 
glance, as snow before the sun ; and such were 
more. As to the features of his face, men differed, 
as spectators are apt to do about the lineaments of 
extraordinary countenances. What was the color 
of his eyes, the contour of his lips, the shape of his 
brow ? Who could say ? Conflicting testimony 
arrived at no verdict. In two respects alone 
opinions agreed about the face of this man : it 
commanded, and it shone ; it had authority and 
light. The shrewdest heresy-hunter in the congregation 
would not have dared question this clergy 
man's theology, or the tendencies of his ritualistic 
views. The veriest pharisee in the audience quailed 
before the blinding brilliance of the preacher's face. 
It was a moral fire. It ate into the heart. Sin and 
shame shriveled before it. 

One might say that all this was apparent in the 
preacher before he had spoken a word. When he 
had opened his lips these impressions were intensified. 
He began in the usual way to read the usual 
prayers, and to conduct the service as was expected 




of him. Nothing eccentric was observable in his 
treatment of the preliminaries of the occasion. The 
fashionable choir, accustomed to dictate the direction 
of the music, met with no interference from 
the clergyman. He announced the hymns and 
anthems that had been selected quite in the ordinary 
manner; and the critics of the great dailies 
took the usual notes of the musical programme. 
In fact, up to the time of the sermon, nothing out 
of the common course occurred. 

But having said this, one must qualify. Was it 
nothing out of the common course that the congregation
in Saint Agatha's should sit as the people 
sat that day, bond-slaves before the enunciation of 
the familiar phrases in the morning's confession ? 

" What a voice ! " whispered the wife of the 
vestryman. But her husband answered her not a 
word. Pale, agitated, with strained eyes uplifted, 
and nervous hands knotted together, he leaned 
towards the stranger. At the first articulate sentence 
from the pulpit, he knew that the success of 
his supply was secured. 

What a voice indeed ! It melted through the 
great house like burning gold. The heart ran after 
it as fire runs through metal. Once or twice in a 

generation one may hear the liturgy read like that 
perhaps. In a lifetime no longer to be counted 
short, the vestryman had heard nothing that 
resembled it. 

" Thank God ! " he murmured. He put his hat 
before his face. He had not realized before what a 
strain he had endured. Cold drops stood upon his 
brow. He shook with relief. From that moment 
he felt no more concern about the service than if he 
had engaged one of the sons of God to " supply." 

" Are you faint ? " asked his wife in a tone of 
annoyance. She offered him her smelling-salts. 

Had there existed stenographic records of that 
sermon, this narrative, necessarily so defective, 
would have no occasion for its being. One of the 
most interesting things about the whole matter is 
that no such records can to-day be found. Report 
ers certainly were in the gallery. The journals had 
sent their picked men as usual, and no more. 
Where, then, were their columns of verbal record ? 
Why has so important a discourse gone afloat upon 
vague, conflicting rumor? No person knows; the 
reporters least of all. One, it is said, lost his 
position for the default of that report; others 




received the severest rebukes of their experience 
from their managing editors for the same cause. 
None had any satisfactory reason to give for his 
failure. 

" I forgot,' said he who lost his position for his 
boyish excuse. " All I can say, sir, is I forgot. 
The man swept me away. I forgot that such a 
paper as The Daily Gossip existed. Other matters,'
he added with expensive candor, "seemed 
more important at the time." 

"When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find 
faith on the earth ? " 

The stranger announced this not unusual text 
with the simple manner of a man who promised 
nothing eccentric in the sermon to come. Yet 
something in the familiar words arrested attention. 
The phrase, as it was spoken, seemed less a hackneyed
biblical quotation than a pointed personal 
question to which each heart in the audience-room 
was compelled to respond. 

The preacher began quietly. He reminded his 
hearers in a few words of the true nature of the 
Christian religion, whose interests he was there to 
represent. One felt that he spoke with tact, and 




with the kind of dignity belonging to the enthusiast 
of a great moral movement. It occurred to one, 
perhaps for the first time, that it was quite manly 
in a Christian preacher to plead his cause with as
