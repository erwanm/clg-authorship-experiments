The boy spoke of this af terwards ? and remembered 
it long for a boy. But at the time he did but 
stare. He stopped grumbling, however, and plunged 
on into the drifts, ahead of the old rector, kicking 
a path for him to right and left in the wet, packed 
snow ; for the widow Peek lived at least a mile away, 
and the storm was now become a virulent thing. 

What passed between the unloved, neglected, 
dying parishoner and her pastor was not known to 
any but themselves, nor is there witness now to tes 
tify thereof. Neither does it in any way concern 
the record of this narrative, except as the least may 
concern the largest circumstance in human story. 
For, in view of what came to pass, it is impossible 
not to put the old, judicial question : Did it pay ? 
Was it worth while ? When the miser's soul went 




out, at midnight, on the wings and the rage of that 
blind, black storm, did it pass gently, a subdued, 
forgiven spirit, humble to learn how to live again, 
for Christ's sake and his who gave himself as his 
Master had before him to comfort and to save? 
Did it pay? Do such things pay? God knows. 
But as long as men do not know, there will always 
be found a few among them who will elect to dis 
regard the doubt, to wear the divinity of 
uncalculating sacrifice, and to pay its price. 

For the soul of the widow Peek the price was 
large, looked at in our mathematical way ; for, when 
the old clergyman, having shrived her soul and 
closed her eyes, started to come home at one o'clock 
of the morning, the storm had become a malignant 
force. Already wet through and through his thin 
coats and worn flannels, weak from the exposure, the 
watching, and the scene of death, every breath a 
sword athwart his inflamed lungs, with fire in his 
brain, and ice at his heart, he staggered against the 
blizzard. 

Dobson's boy had long since sought the shelter 
of his own home, and the old man was quite unattended. 
True, the neighbor who watched with the 
dead woman suggested that he remain till morning ; 

but the widow Peek's house was cold (she was 
always especially "near" about fuel), and he thought 
it more prudent to get back to his own stove and 
his bed. 

Whether he lost his way ; whether he crossed and 
recrossed it, wandering from it in the dark and 
drift; whether he fell and lay in the snow for a 
time, and rose again, and staggered on, and fell 
again, and so pushed on again, cannot be known. 
It is only known that at half-past two on Saturday 
morning his landlady put her wrinkled face out of 
the window, for the twentieth time, in search of him 
(for she had a thought for him in her own hard- 
featured way), and saw him fallen, and feebly trying 
to crawl on his hands and knees up the drifted 
steps. 

She got him in to his warm study, past the chair 
where the flowered dressing-gown and old slippers 
awaited him, and as far as the carpet-covered lounge, 
Beyond this he could not be taken. 

By morning the whole parish rang the door-bell ; 
the hands and hearts and horses, the purses, the 
nurses, the doctors, the watchers, the tears, and the 
prayers of the village, were his for he was dearly 
beloved and cherished in that parish. But he lay 

on his old lounge in his study among his books, and 
asked of them nothing at all. The kerosene lamp, 
behind its green shade, went out; and the Bible, 
with the pile of sermons on the table, looked large 
in the snow-light of a day when the storm ceases 
without sun. He did not talk; but his thoughts 
were yet alive. He remembered Saint Agatha's, 
and the sermon which he was to preach to-morrow. 
He knew that not one of his people (ignorant of 
such matters) would understand how to get word 
to the city vestry. He tried to give directions, but 
his voice refused his bidding. He knew that he 
would be supposed to have failed to meet his
appointment, perhaps to have been thwarted a rural 
clergyman, old and timorous, baffled in an important 
professional engagement by a little snow. He 
was to have taken the evening train. He was to be 
the guest of the vestryman who wrote that pleasant 
letter. He was to preach in Saint Agatha's 
to-morrow. He was to 

Nay, he was not, nay. He was to do none 
of these things. A sick man, mortally a sick man, 
past power of speech, he lay upon his carpet lounge, 
shivering under the pile of thin blankets and cotton 
comforters that had been wrapped around him, and 


 

gently faced his fate. He could not preach at Saint 
Agatha s. And he could not explain to the vestry. 
Perhaps his heart-sickness about this matter 
subsided a little one likes to think so as his disease 
grew upon him ; but there are men who will under 
stand me when I say that this was the greatest 
disappointment of his humble, holy life. 

As Saturday night drew on, and the stars came 
out, he was heard to make such efforts to speak 
articulately, that one of his weeping people (an 
affectionate woman of a brighter wit than the rest) 
made out, as she bent lovingly over him, to 
understand so much as this : 

" Lord," he said, " into thy hands I commit my 
s-p " 

" He commits his spirit to the Lord ! " sobbed the 
landlady. 

But the listening parishioner raised her finger to 
her lips. 

" Lord," he said again, and this time the dullest 
ear in the parish could have heard the words 
"Lord," he prayed, "into thy hands I commit 
my supply." 

Sunday morning broke upon the city as cold and 




clear as the sword of a rebuking angel. People on 
the way to the West End churches exchanged notes 
on the thermometer, and talked of the destitution of 
the poor. It was so cold that the ailing and the 
aged for the most part stayed at home. But the 
young, the ennuye, the imitative, and the soul-sick, 
got themselves into their furs and carriages when 
the chimes rang, and the audiences were, on the 
whole, as comfortable and as devout as usual. 

The vestryman sat nervously in his pew. He 
had not fully recovered from the fact that his 
supply had disappointed him. Having sent his coach 
man in vain to all the Saturday evening trains to 
meet his country parson, the vestryman had passed 
but an uneasy night. 

" I had supposed the old man had principles 
about Sunday travel," he said to his wife, " but it 
seems he is coming in the morning, after all. He 
might at least have sent me word." 

" Telegraphing in the country is difficult, 
sometimes, I have heard," replied the lady, vaguely. 
She was a handsome, childless woman, with the 
haughty under lip of her class. Her husband spoke 
cheerily, but he was not at ease, and she did not 
know how to make him so. 




The Sunday morning train came in from the 
country station forty miles back, but the old clergy 
man was not among its passengers. Now thoroughly 
alarmed, the vestryman had started for his hat and 
coat, when his parlor-maid brought him a message. 
It had been left at the door, she said, by a 
messenger who brooked neither delay nor question, but 
ordered her to tell the master of the house that the 
supply for Saint Agatha's was in the city, and would 
meet the engagement at the proper time and place. 
The old clergyman, the messenger added, had been 
suddenly stricken with a dangerous illness, and 
could not be expected; but his substitute would 
fill the pulpit for the day. The vestryman was 
requested to feel no concern in the matter. The 
preacher preferred retirement until the hour of the 
service, and would fulfil his duties at the church at 
the appointed hour. 

But when the vestryman, feeling flurried despite 
himself, tapped at the door of the luxurious vestry- 
room, gracefully refurnished that winter for the 
rector with the sore throat who was in the south of 
France, he found it locked ; and to his unobtrusive 
knock no answer came. At this uncomfortable moment
