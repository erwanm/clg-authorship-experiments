their piratical cruises in the lagoons ; gave aid and 
comfort to those enemies of Venice, the Visconti, the 
Carraras, and the Genoese ; revolted from St. Mark 
whenever subjected to his banner, and finally, rather 
than remain under his sway, gave themselves five 
centuries ago to Austria. 

The objects of interest in Trieste are not many. 
There are remains of an attributive temple of Jupiter 
under the Duomo, and there is near at hand the 
Museum of Classical Antiquities founded in honor of 
Winckelmann, murdered at Trieste by that ill-advised 
Pistojese, Ancangeli, who had seen the medals be- 
stowed on the antiquary by Maria Theresa and 
believed him rich. There is also a scientific museum 
founded by the Archduke Maximilian, and, above 
all, there is the beautiful residence of that ill-starred 
prince, the Miramare, where the half-crazed Em- 
press of the Mexicans vainly waits her husband's re- 
turn from the experiment of paternal government in 
the New World. It would be hard to tell how Art 
has charmed rock and wave at Miramare, until the 
spur of one of those rugged Triestine hills, jutting 
into the sea, has been made the seat of ease and 



 

luxury, but the visitor is aware of the magic as soon 
as he passes the gate of the palace grounds. These 
are in great part perpendicular, and are over clam- 
bered with airy stairways climbing to pensile arbors. 
Where horizontal, they are diversified with mimic 
seas for swans to sail upon, and summer-houses for 
people to lounge in and look at the swans from. On 
the point of land furthest from the acclivity stands 
the Castle of Miramare, half at sea, and half adrift 
in the clouds above : 

" And fain it would stoop downward 

To the mirrored wave below ; 
And fain it would soar upward 
In the evening's crimson glow." 

I remember that a little yacht lay beside the pier 
at the castle's foot, and lazily flapped its sail, while 
the sea beat inward with as languid a pulse. That 
was some years ago, before Mexico was dreamed of 
at Miramare : now, perchance, she who is one of the 
most unhappy among women looks down distraught 
from those high windows, and finds in the helpless 
sail and impassive wave the images of her baffled 
hope, and that immeasurable sea which gives back 
its mariners neither to love nor sorrow. I think 
though she be the wife and daughter of princes, we 
may pity this poor Empress at least as much as we 
pity the Mexicans to whom her dreams have brought 
so many woes. 

It was the midnight following my visit to Mira- 
mare when the fiacre in which I had quitted my 
friend's house was drawn up by its greatly bewil- 



 

dered driver on the quay near the place where the 
steamer for Venice should be lying. There was no 
steamer for Venice to be seen. The driver swore 
a little in the polyglot profanities of his native city, 
and descending from his box, went and questioned 
different lights blue lights, yellow lights, green 
lights to be seen at different points. To a light, 
they were ignorant, though eloquent, and to pass the 
time, we drove up and down the quay, and stopped 
at the landings of all the steamers that touch at 
Trieste. It was a snug fiacre enough, but I did not 
care to spend the night in it, and I urged the driver 
to further inquiry. A wanderer whom we met, de- 
clared that it was not the night for the Venice 
steamer ; another admitted that it might be ; a third 
conversed with the driver in low tones, and then 
leaped upon the box. We drove rapidly away, and 
before I had, in view of this mysterious proceeding, 
composed a fitting paragraph for the Fatti Diversi of 
the Osservatore Triestino, descriptive of the state in 
which the Guardie di Polizia should find me floating 
in the bay, exanimate and evidently the prey of a 
triste evvenimento the driver pulled up once more, 
and now beside a steamer. It was the steamer for 
Venice, he said, in precisely the tone which he would 
have used had he driven me directly to it without 
blundering. It was breathing heavily, and was just 
about to depart, but even in the hurry of getting on 
board, I could not help noticing that it seemed to 
have grown a great deal since I had last voyaged in 
it. There was not a soul to be seen except the mute 



 

steward who took my satchel, and guiding me below 
into an elegant saloon, instantly left me alone. Here 
again the steamer was vastly enlarged. These were 
not the narrow quarters of the Venice steamer, nor 
was this lamp, shedding a soft light on cushioned 
seats and paneled doors and wainscotings the sort of 
illumination usual in that humble craft. I rang the 
small silver bell on the long table, and the mute 
steward appeared. 

Was this the steamer for Venice ? 

Sicuro ! 

All that I could do in comment was to sit down ; 
and in the mean time the steamer trembled, groaned, 
choked, cleared its throat, and we were under way. 

" The other passengers have all gone to bed, I sup- 
pose," I argued acutely, seeing none of them. Never- 
theless, I thought it odd, and it seemed a shrewd 
means of relief to ring the bell, and pretending 
drowsiness, to ask the steward which was my state- 
room. 

He replied with a curious smile that I could have 
any of them. Amazed, I yet selected a state-room, 
and while the steward was gone for the sheets and 
pillow-cases, I occupied my time by opening the doors 
of all the other state-rooms. They were empty. 

" Am I the only passenger ? " I asked, when he 
returned, with some anxiety. 

" Precisely," he answered. 

I could not proceed and ask if he composed the 
entire crew it seemed too fearfully probable that 
he did. 



 

I now suspected that I had taken passage with 
the Olandese Volante. There was nothing in the 
world for it, however, but to go to bed, and there, 
with the accession of a slight sea-sickness, my views 
of the situation underwent a total change. I had 
gone down into the Maelstrom with the Ancient 
Mariner I was a Manuscript Found in a Bottle ! 

Coining to the surface about six o'clock A. M., I 
found a daylight as cheerful as need be upon the 
appointments of the elegant cabin, and upon the good- 
natured face of the steward when he brought me 
the caffe latte, and the buttered toast for my break 
fast. He said "Servitor suo!" in a loud and com- 
fortable voice, and I perceived the absurdity of hav- 
ing thought that he was in any way related to the 
Nightmare-Death-in-life-that-thicks-man's-blood-with- 
cold. 

" This is not the regular Venice steamer, I sup- 
pose," I remarked to the steward as he laid my 
breakfast in state upon the long table. 

No. Properly, no boat should have left for Venice 
last night, which was not one of the times of the tri- 
weekly departure. This was one of the steamers 
of the line between Trieste and Alexandria, and it 
was going at present to take on an extraordinary 
freight at Venice for Egypt. I had been permitted 
to come on board because my driver said I had a 
return ticket, and would go. 

Ascending to the deck I found nothing whatever 
mysterious in the management of the steamer. The 
captain met me with a bow in the gangway ; seamen 



 

were coiling wet ropes at different points, as they 
always are ; the mate was promenading the bridge, 
and taking the rainy weather as it came, with his 
oil-cloth coat and hat on. The wheel of the steamer 
was as usual chewing the sea, and finding it unpala- 
table, and making vain efforts at expectoration. 

We were in sight of the breakwater outside Mala- 
mocco, and a pilot-boat was making us from the land. 
Even at this point the innumerable fortifications of 
the Austrians began, and they multiplied as we drew
