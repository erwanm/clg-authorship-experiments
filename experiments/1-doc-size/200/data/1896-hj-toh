" It is what I wish," Tony interrupted ; " strangely 
as it may strike you that, in regard to such a 
matter as we refer to, one should be eager for 
such a responsibility. The question of time 
doesn't signify what signifies is one's sincerity. 



 

I had an impression, I confess, that the prospect 
I a good while ago supposed you to have accepted 
had what shall I call it? rather faded away. 
But at the same time I hoped " and Tony 
invited his companion to resume their walk 
"that it would charmingly come up again." 

Jean moved beside him and spoke with a 
colourless kindness which suggested no desire to 
challenge or cross-question, but a thoughtful in 
terest in anything, in the connection in which 
they were talking, that he would be so good as 
to tell her, and an earnest desire to be clear about 
it. Perhaps there was also in her manner just 
the visible tinge of a confidence that he would 
tell her the absolute truth. "I see. You hoped 
it would charmingly come up again." 

"So that on learning that it is charmingly 
coming up, don't you see," Tony laughed, "I'm 
so agreeably agitated that I spill over on the 
spot. I want without delay to be definite to 
you about the really immense opinion I have of 
dear Paul. It can't do any harm, and it may 
do a little good, to mention that it has always 
seemed to me that we've only got to give him 
time. I mean, of course, don't you know," he 
added, "for him quite to distinguish himself." 





Jean was silent a little, as if she were thor 
oughly taking this home. " Distinguish himself 
in what way?" she asked with all her tran 
quillity. 

"Well in every way," Tony handsomely re 
plied. " He's full of stuff there's a great deal 
of him: too much to come out all at once. Of 
course you know him you've known him half 
your life; but I see him in a strong and special 
light, a light in which he has scarcely been shown 
to you, and which puts him to a real test. He 
has ability; he has ideas; he has absolute hon 
esty; and he has moreover a good stiff back of 
his own. He's a fellow of head; he's a fellow 
of heart. In short he's a man of gold." 

" He's a man of gold," Jean repeated with 
punctual acceptance, yet as if it mattered much 
more that Tony should think so than that she 
should. "It would be odd," she went on, "to 
be talking with you on a subject so personal to 
myself, if it were not that I felt Paul's attitude 
for so long past to be rather publicly taken for 
granted. He has felt it so, too, I think, poor 
boy, and, for good or for ill, there has been in 
our situation very little mystery and perhaps 
not much modesty." 



 

"Why should there be, of the false kind, 
when even the true has nothing to do with the 
matter ? You and Paul are great people : he's 
the heir-apparent, and you're the most eligible 
princess in the Almanach de Gotha. You can't 
be there and be hiding behind the window- 
curtain: you must step out on the balcony to 
be seen of the populace. Your most private 
affairs are affairs of state. At the smallest hint 
like the one I just mentioned, even an old dunder 
head like me catches on he sees the strong 
reasons for Paul's attitude. However, it's not 
of that, so much, that I wanted to say a word. 
I thought perhaps you'd just let me touch on 
your own." Tony hesitated; he felt vaguely 
disconcerted by the special quality of stillness 
that, though she moved beside him, her atten 
tion, her expectation put forth. It came over 
him that for the purpose of his plea she was 
almost too prepared, and this made him speculate. 
He stopped short again, and, uneasily, "May I 
light one more cigarette?" he asked. She as 
sented with a flicker in her dim smile, and while 
he lighted he was increasingly conscious that 
she waited. He met the deep gentleness of her 
eyes and reflected afresh that if she was always 





beautiful, she was beautiful at different times 
from different sources. What was the source of 
the impression she made on him at this moment 
if not a kind of refinement of patience in which 
she seemed actually to hold her breath? "In 
fact," he said as he threw away his match, "I 
have touched on it I mean on the great hope 
we all have that you do see your way to meeting 
our friend as he deserves." 

"You 'all' have it?" Jean softly asked. 

Tony hesitated again. "I'm sure I'm quite 
right in speaking for Wilverley at large. It 
takes the greatest interest in Paul, and I needn't, 
at this time of day, remind you of the interest 
it takes in yourself. But I repeat, what I meant 
more particularly to utter was my own special 
confidence in your decision. Now that I'm fully 
enlightened, it comes home to me that, as regards 
such a possibility as your taking your place here 
as a near neighbour and a permanent friend " 
and Tony fixedly smiled " why, I can only feel 
the liveliest suspense. I want to make thor 
oughly sure of you ! " 

Jean took this in as she had taken the rest; 
after which she simply said: "Then I think I 
ought to tell you that I shall not meet Paul in 



 

the way that what you're so good as to say seems 
to point to." 

Tony had made many speeches, both in public 
and in private, and he had naturally been exposed 
to replies of the incisive no less than of the 
massive order. But no check of the current 
had ever made him throw back his head quite 
so far as this brief and placid announcement. 
"You'll not meet him ?" 

"I shall never marry him." 

He undisguisedly gasped. "In spite of all 
the reasons ? " 

" Of course I've thought the reasons over 
often and often. But there are reasons on the 
other side too. I shall never marry him," she 
repeated.

SOMETHING strange occurred for Tony Bream 
as he listened to the words in which Jean Martle 
dispelled such obscurity as had hitherto attached 
to her position something consisting of the fact 
that though half an hour before he had not felt 
the want of the assurance he had just asked of 
her, yet now that he saw it definitely withheld 
it took an importance as instantly as a mirror 
takes a reflection. This importance was so great 
that he found himself suddenly scared by what 
he heard. He thought an instant, with intensity. 
" In spite of knowing that you'll disappoint " 
he paused a little "the universal hope?" 

" I know whom I shall disappoint ; but I must 
bear that. I shall disappoint Cousin Kate." 

"Horribly," said Tony. 

" Horribly." 

" And poor Paul to within an inch of his life." 

" No, not poor Paul, Mr. Bream ; not poor Paul
