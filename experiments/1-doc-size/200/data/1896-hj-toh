Tony fixed her an instant. " Not Miss Martle," 
he repeated. 

" But who then ? And where is she now ? " 

" It's positive she's not here ? " the Doctor 
asked of Rose. 

" Positive Mrs. Beever knew. Where is she ? " 
Rose rang out. 

"Where in the name ?" passed, as with 

the dawn of a deeper horror, from their companion 
to Tony. 

Tony's eyes sounded Rose's, and hers blazed 



 

back. His silence was an anguish, his face a 
convulsion. " It isn't half an hour," he at last 
brought out. 

" Since it happened ? " The Doctor blinked at 
his sudden knowledge. "Then when ?" 

Tony looked at him straight. " When I was 
there." 

"And when was that?" 

"After I called for you." 

" To leave word for me to go ? " The Doctor 
set his face. "But you weren't going home 
then." 

"I did go I had a reason. You know it," 
Tony said to Rose. 

" When you went for your paper ? " She 
thought. "But Effie wasn't there then." 

"Why not? She was there, but Miss Martle 
wasn't with her." 

"Then, in God's name, who was?" cried the 
Doctor. 

" I was," said Tony. 

Rose gave the inarticulate cry of a person who 
has been holding her breath, and the Doctor an 
equally loud, but more stupefied " You ? " 

Tony fixed upon Rose a gaze that seemed to 
count her respirations. "I was with her," he 





repeated ; " and I was with her alone. And 
what was done I did." He paused while they 
both gasped; then he looked at the Doctor. 
"Now you know." They continued to gasp; 
his confession was a blinding glare, in the shock 
of which the Doctor staggered back from Rose 
and she fell away with a liberated spring. " God 
forgive me!" howled Tony he broke now into 
a storm of sobs. He dropped upon a bench with 
his wretched face in his hands, while Rose, with 
a passionate wail, threw herself, appalled, on 
the grass, and their companion, in a colder dis 
may, looked from one prostrate figure to the other. 



BOOK THIRD 



XXVIII 

THE greatest of the parlour-maids came from 
the hall into the drawing-room at Eastmead 
the high, square temple of mahogany and tapes 
try in which, the last few years, Mrs. Beever 
had spent much time in rejoicing that she had 
never set up new gods. She had left it, from 
the first, as it was full of the old things that, 
on succeeding to her husband's mother, she had 
been obliged, as a young woman of that period, 
to accept as dolefully different from the things 
thought beautiful by other young women whose 
views of drawing-rooms, all about her, had also 
been intensified by marriage. She had not un- 
assistedly discovered the beauty of her heritage, 
and she had not from any such subtle suspicion 
kept her hands off it. She had never in her 
life taken any course with regard to any object 
for reasons that had so little to do with her 
duty. Everything in her house stood, at an 






angle of its own, on the solid rock of the disci 
pline it had cost her. She had therefore lived 
with mere dry wistfulness through the age of 
rosewood, and had been rewarded by finding 
that, like those who sit still in runaway vehicles, 
she was the only person not thrown out. Her 
mahogany had never moved, but the way people 
talked about it had, and the people who talked 
were now eager to sit down with her on every 
thing that both she and they had anciently 
thought plainest and poorest. It was Jean above 
all who had opened her eyes opened them in 
particular to the great wine-dark doors, polished 
and silver-hinged, with which the lady of East- 
mead, arriving at the depressed formula that 
they were "gloomy," had for thirty years, pru 
dently, on the whole, as she considered, shut 
out the question of taste. One of these doors 
Manning now softly closed, standing, however, 
with her hand on the knob and looking across 
as if, in the stillness, to listen at another which 
exactly balanced with it on the opposite side of 
the room. The light of the long day had not 
wholly faded, but what remained of it was the 
glow of the western sky, which showed through 
the wide, high window that was still open to 



 

the garden. The sensible hush in which Man 
ning waited was broken after a moment by a 
movement, ever so gentle, of the other door. 
Mrs. Beever put her head out of the next 
room; then, seeing her servant, closed the door 
with precautions and came forward. Her face, 
hard but overcharged, had already asked a ques 
tion. 

" Yes, Ma'am Mr. Vidal. I showed him, as 
you told me, into the library." 

Mrs. Beever thought. "It may be wanted. 
I'll see him here." But she checked the woman's 
retreat. " Mr. Beever's in his room ? " 

"No, Ma'am he went out." 

" But a minute ago ? " 

"Longer, Ma'am. After he had carried in " 

Mrs. Beever stayed the word on Manning's 
lips and quickly supplied her own. " The poor 
sick little girl yes. He went to Mr. Bream?" 

"No, Ma'am the other way." 

Mrs. Beever thought afresh. " But Miss Armi- 
ger's in?" 

" Oh, yes in her room." 

"She went straight?" 

Manning, on her side, reflected. " Yes, Ma'am. 
She always goes straight." 





" Not always," said Mrs. Beever. " But she's 
quiet there?" 

"Very quiet?" 

" Then call Mr. Vidal." While Manning obeyed 
she turned to the window and stared at the gath 
ering dusk. Then the door that had been left 
open closed again, and she faced about to Dennis 
Vidal. 

" Something dreadful has happened ? " he in 
stantly asked. 

"Something dreadful has happened. You've
