"And if it could be Russia leather! That 
would last him all his life. At all events, we 
will spend half on him ; and I am sure he will 
deserve it. He will, likely, be the greatest suf- 
ferer by the confusion." 

"The boys will be out of doors much of the 


time, no doubt. "We must try to improve our 
invalid as rapidly as possible. Poor boy ! ' 

"Mamma," I said, "what a great generous 
heart you have ! You always pity every one. I 
have a suspicion that Mr. Louis is cross as well 
as sick." 

"Then we must minister to the mind as well 
as the body." 

"I am o-lad that Stuart is bright and cheerfull." 

" O, those children must come in ! she said, 
starting up. "Fanny is so thoughtless!' 

They answered the summons, but sat down 
on the porch step, where Stuart finished a story 
of boyish school-pranks, which was very amusing, 
to say the least. Papa came in time to hear the 
last of it, and shook his head rather sagely. 
It is past ten," announced mamma. 


Country bed-time ! ' said Stuart, gayly. '' I 
suppose, Mrs. Endicott, that is a hint for me to 
go stir up my bear, and listen to a few growls. 
A menagerie ; ten cents admittance. Who'll 
venture in ? Don't all speak at once, or the 
place may be crowded." 

" Perhaps, since he is not very well, you had 
better sleep in another room to-night," mamma 
said. 

" Because he might eat me up in the night, 
since he refused his supper. I am much obliged, 
Mrs. Endicott." 

Mamma came around a trifle, so that she faced 
him, and, standing in the shaded light, raised 
her soft, dark eves to his, and said, 



"This is out of consideration to him, and not 
the fear of what will happen to you. That will 
be the thought for vou to go to bed with, and 


see if you cannot resolve it into a lesson worth 
the learning. If I adopt you into my household, 
I shall train you as one of my children. And 
you will be astonished to see what marvels a 
little care for the feelings of others will work." 
Stuart blushed and smiled, said good night, 
and followed papa to the best guest-chamber, 
that I had put in such lovely order. And so 
there was quiet through the night. 


Louis did not make his appearance at break- 
fast ; but Stuart had been in stirring him up, for 
we heard the growls. But he was so merry and 
good-natured when he came down, that one had 
not the heart to find any fault. Indeed, he kept 
the children laughing all through the meal. 



"What is there to do in this queer little town, 
Mr. Endicott ? ' he asked presently. "Fishing. 
I suppose the staple amusement of lazy people. 
Any hunting ? ' 

"Xot at this season; and very little at any. 
There are some nice rambles, and the fishing, as 
you say." 

"Any young fellows that one would like ? ' 

"Yes a number; though some of them keep 
pretty busy during the day. And I forgot row- 
ing. There are boats to be had." 

"Thank you. I'll take a saunter round. I 
always do have the luck of finding some one." 

" And there are books in the library. You 
may like to keep fresh for fall. So your broth- 
er was a good deal disappointed at not passing '! ' 



"Yes. It wouldn't have troubled me. Steve 
was not a bit anxious ; so I should have let itj. 
go without a sigh. There is nothing like rejig 

Kit ion in this world.' 



 

"You are an admirable pattern of it," said 
Fanny. "I feel tempted to envy you. I have 
another fortnight of school ; and fearful exami- 
nations are hanging over my devoted head. 

"Couldn't I go in your stead? I am fresh 
from it all, and might save you much vanity 
and vexation of spirit." 

" Especially the vanity. Your kindness is only 
exceeded by your great beauty. Shakespeare" 

" Fanny ! ' said papa. 

Mamma rose from the table, and prepared a 
dainty breakfast upon a waiter, pouring the coffee 
in a pretty medallion cup that had been 
given her at Christmas. Then she took it her- 
self. Stuart sprang up with an instinct of gen- 
tlemanliiiess. 

" You are not going to carry that up stairs ? ' 
he asked, in surprise. 

"Why not?" 

"If you are not going to send a servant, I 
will take it." 

"You may carry it for me, if you like ; but I 
wish to make a call upon your brother." 

He was her attendant as far as the door ; but 
a - when her summons was answered, she dismissed 
tha\ m . Then she walked straight to the bedside, 
there -i n g her tray on a small table. 



 

' ' Are you rested this morning ? : she asked, 
gently. "I think you w r ill feel better for some 
breakfast. I am sorry that you should be so 
fatigued and ill, for a place seldom looks bright 
under such circumstances. But we will do our 
best for you, and you must try as well." 

The scowl remained in his forehead. He raised 
himself on his elbow, and turned towards her, 
though his eyes were still averted. 

"I am obliged for the trouble, though I do 
not need any breakfast," he said, rather gruffly. 

"I think you do need it. Here is a glass of 
cool spring water, and some fragrant coffee. A 
little of both may revive you. Does your head 
still ache ? If I had known just what to do for 
you, I should have come again last night." 

"Was it you who ' and his face flushed a 
swarthy scarlet. 

" Yes ; ' and mamma looked steadily at him 
out of her sweet brown eyes. 

lie moved uneasily, and in his heart wished 
she were away. 

"Was it you who* came last evening?' he 
asked, in a low, wondering tone. 

"Yes. I felt anxious about you. I knew you 
were in a strange place, and, doubtless, feeling 


awkward and lonesome. That must be my 
apology." 

"O," he exclaimed, "don't make any to me. 
I acted like a boor ! I am sorry and ashamed. 
And I don't deserve that you should take all 
this trouble for me. But I had been " 

"And I did sympathize with you to the ut- 
most. The disappointment must have proved
