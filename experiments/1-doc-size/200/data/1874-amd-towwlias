He took a trip to Madison one day. The cottage was nothing but a heap
of crumbling boards. Had they ever lived there, and been so happy?

"It'll never be the same place again," said Granny, listening to the
summer's improvements. "I am glad we came away. I couldn't have seen
the old house torn down. Maybe it's the flowers here, and the children,
that makes it seem like home to me; but most of all I think it must be
you, dear Hal. And so I'm satisfied, as the good Lord knows."

Her caps were a trifle more pretentious, and her gowns more in modern
style; but she was Granny still, and not one of them would have had her
changed. When she sat in her rocking-chair, with her hands crossed in
her lap, Hal thought her the prettiest thing in the house.

"Hooray!" exclaimed Kit, rushing home one evening out of breath, and
covered with snow. "What do you think? Granny, you could never guess!"

"I never was good at guessing," returned Granny meekly.

"Something wonderful! Oh, a new fiddle!" said Dot.

"No: and Hal won't try. Well"--with a long breath--"I'm going--to
play--at a concert!"

"Oh!" the three exclaimed in a breath.

"And it's the oddest thing," began Kit, full of excitement. "You see,
there's to be a concert given in New York, to help raise funds to give
the newsboys, and other homeless children, a great Christmas dinner.
Mr. Kriessman has it in hand; and, because it's for boys, he wants me
to play--all alone."

"O Kit! you can't," said Hal. "When you faced the audience, it would
seem so strange, and you would lose your courage."

"No I wouldn't, either! I'd say to myself, 'Here's a dinner for a
hungry boy,' and then I wouldn't mind the people. Mr. Kriessman is sure
I can do it; and I've been practising all the evening. A real concert!
Think of it. Oh, if Joe can only be here!"

Dot put her arms round his neck, and kissed him. Hal winked his eyes
hard, remembering the old dreams in the garret.

He went to see Mr. Kriessman the next day.

"The boy is a genius, I tell you, Mr. Kenneth," said the enthusiastic
professor. "He will be a great man,--you see, you see! He has the soul,
the eyes, the touch. He fail!" and an expression of lofty scorn crossed
the fair, full face.

"But he has had so little practice"--

"It will all be right. You see, you see! Just leave him to me. And he
is so little!"

Hal smiled. Kit did not bid fair to become the family giant, it was
true.

Not a moment did the child lose. Dot declared that he could hardly eat.
Charlie was in high delight when she heard of it; for Mr. Darol was
going to take her and Miss Charteris. Hal hardly knew whether he dared
venture, or not.

But Joe did come just in the nick of time, and insisted that everybody
should go, ordering a carriage, and bundling Dot and Granny into it;
poor Granny being so confused that she could hardly make beginning or
end of it. And, when they were seated in the great hall that was as
light as day, she glanced helplessly around to Joe.

"Never you mind, Granny! I'm not a bit afraid," he whispered. "He will
fiddle with the best of them."

'The wonderful boy violinist,' it said on the programme. "If he should
not be so wonderful," thought Hal quietly, with a great fear in his
soul. He could not tell what should make him so nervous.

Mr. Darol came and spoke to them. "Isn't it odd?" he said with a laugh.
"Why, I never dreamed of it until Charlie told me! I wouldn't have
missed it for any thing."

The concert began. There was an orchestral overture, then a fine
quartet, a cornet solo, and so they went on. Hal followed the programme
down. Then he drew a long breath, and looked neither to the right nor
the left. That little chap perched up on the stage, Kit? making his
bow, and adjusting his violin, and--hark!

It was not the story of the child lost in the storm, but something
equally pathetic. Mr. Kriessman had made a fortunate selection.
Curiosity died out in the faces of the audience, and eagerness took its
place. Ah, what soft, delicious strains! Was it the violin, or the
soul of the player? Not a faltering note, not a sign of fear; and Hal
laughed softly to himself. On and on, now like the voice of a bird,
then the rustle of leaves, the tinkle of waters, fainter, fainter, a
mere echo,--a bow, and he was gone.

There was a rapturous round of applause. It nearly subsided once, then
began so vehemently that it brought Kit out again. But this time he was
the gayest little fiddler that ever played at an Irish fair. People
nodded and smiled to each other, and felt as if they must dance a jig
in another moment.

Joe bent over to Granny.

"Isn't that gay?" he asked. "Kit has beaten the lot of us. Granny, if
you are not proud of him, I'll take you straight home, and keep you on
bread and water for a month."

Proud of him! Why, Granny sat there crying her old eyes out from pure
joy. Her darling little Kit!

"Dot," exclaimed Mr. Darol as they were going out, "we shall hear of
you as an actress next. I never knew of such wonderful people in my
life."

"Oh, it was magnificent!" said Charlie. "And the applause!"

"That I should have lived to see the day!"

"Why, Granny, it would have been very unkind of you if you had not,"
declared Joe solemnly.

How they all reached home, they never exactly knew. They laughed and
cried, and it was almost morning before they thought of going to bed.

But the notices next day were as good as a feast. There could be no
doubt now. Hal understood that from henceforth Kit and his fiddle would
be inseparable. It was "born in him," as Joe said. As for Kit, he
hardly knew whether he were in the body, or out of the body.

Hal and Dot set about making up accounts the day before Christmas. The
three-months' proceeds had been two hundred and sixty dollars; pretty
fair for a beginning, and a whole green-house full of flowers coming
into bloom. He was on the high road to prosperity. So he fastened his
glasses, put on his coal, and arranged his heat cut-offs for the night,
and came into the house. There were Dot and Kit and Charlie, and the
supper waiting.

"And there is the six-months' interest," said Hal. "Next year we can
let up a little on dear, generous Joe. And to-night is Christmas Eve."

Joe rushed in.

"What do you think, Granny? I've just come from Flossy's. They have a
beautiful little boy named Hal Kenneth,--a real Christmas gift, and no
mistake. Here's to your namesake, Hal; though, try his best, he can
never be half as good as you."

I do believe poor, foolish Hal had his eyes full of tears, thinking
of Flossy's great joy. But Charlie and Kit cheered in a tremendous
fashion.

After the supper was cleared away, they sat in a little circle, and
talked. There always was so much to say, and Joe liked nothing half so
well as to hear of every event that had transpired in his absence. They
all kept such a warm interest in each other!

Somehow they strayed back to the last Christmas, and the "songs in the
night."

"Sing again," besought Granny.

Dot's birdlike voice was first to raise its clear notes. One hymn was
dearer than all the rest. The music quivered a little when they came to
this verse, as if tears and heart-throbs were not far off:--

      "Wonderful night!
    Sweet be thy rest to the weary!
    Making the dull heart and dreary
    Laugh with a dream of delight.
      Wonderful, wonderful night!"

And then a tender silence fell over them. They clasped each other's
hands softly, and the breaths had a strangled sound. Granny alive, Joe
raised from the dead, Kit some day to be a famous musician!

Joe crept up to Granny, and kissed her wrinkled face. Somehow it seemed
as if the furrows began to fill out.

"Oh," he said huskily, "there's nothing in the world so wonderful,
nor so sweet, nor so precious as 'The Old Woman who lived in a Shoe!'
When I think of her love, her patient toil, her many cares, and the
untiring devotion with which she has labored for us all, I feel that we
can never, never repay her. O Granny!"

"I've been glad to have you all, God knows. There wasn't one too many."

Not one of the loving arms that encircled her could have been spared.
There she sat enthroned, a prouder woman to-night, poor old Granny
Kenneth, than many a duchess in a blaze of diamonds. Fair Florence;
laughing Joe, with his great, warm heart; sweet, tender Hal; racketing
Charlie; Kit, with his scalp-lock waving in the breeze; and dear little
Dot,--jewels enough for any woman, surely!

Ah, children! love her with the best there is in your fresh young
souls. Make the paths smooth for her weary feet, remembering the years
she has trudged on the thorny highway of life for your sakes. When the
eyes grow dim, bring the brightest in your lives to glorify her way.
Cling to her, kiss warmth into the pale lips; for when she has gone to
heaven it will seem all too little at the best. True, she will reap her
