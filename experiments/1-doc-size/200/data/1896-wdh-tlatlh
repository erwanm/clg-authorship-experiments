He did not know at first how to break the silence 
which she let follow upon her words. At last he said : 
" You spoke, just now, about taking it with you. Of 
course you don't think of leaving Lion's Head ! " 

She did not answer for so long a time that he 
thought she had not perhaps heard him, or heeded 
what he said, but she answered, finally : " We did think 
of it. The day you come we had about made up our 
minds to leave.*' 

" Oh ! " 

" But I've been thinkin' of something since you've 
been here that I don't know but you'll say is about as 
wild as wantin' to buy a three-hundred-dollar picture 
with a week's board." She gave a short self-scornful 
laugh ; but it was a laugh, and it relieved the tension. 

" It may not be worth any more," he said, glad of 
the relief. 

" Oh, I guess it is," she rejoined, and then she 
waited for him to prompt her. 

" Well ? " 

" Well, it's this ; and I wanted to ask you, anyway. 
You think there'd be any chance of my gettin' sum- 
mer folks to come here and board, if I was to put an 
advertisement in a Boston paper ? I know it's a lone- 
some place, and there ain't what you may call attrac- 
tions. But the folks from the hotels, sometimes, when 
they ride over in a stage to see the view, praise up the 
scenery, and I guess it is sightly. I know that well 
enough; and I ain't afraid but what I can do for 
boarders as well as some, if not better. What do you 
think?" 



 

" I think that's a capital idea, Mrs. Durgin." 

" It's that, or go," she said. " There ain't a livin' 
for us on the farm any more, and we got to do some- 
thin'. If there was anything else I could do ! But 
I've thought it out, and thought it out, and I guess 
there ain't anything I can do but take boarders — if I 
can get them." 

" I should think you'd find it rather pleasant on 
some accounts. Your boarders would be company for 
you," said Westover. 

" We're comjiany enough for ourselves," said Mrs. 
Durgin. " I ain't ever been lonesome here, from the 
first minute. I guess I had company enough when I 
was a girl to last me — the sort that hotel folks are. I 
presume Mr. Whitwell spoke to you about my father ? " 

"Yes; he did, Mrs. Durgin." 

" I don't presume he said anything that wa'n't true. 
It's all right. But I know how my mother used to 
slave, and how I used to slave myself ; and I always 
said I'd rather do anything than wait on boarders ; 
and now I guess I got to come to it. The sight of 
summer folks makes me sick ! I guess I could 'a' had 
'em long ago, if I'd wanted to. There ! I've said 
enough." She rose, with a sudden lift of her power- 
ful frame, and stood a moment as if expecting West- 
over to say something. 

He said, " Well, when you've made your mind up, 
send your advertisement to me, and I'll attend to it 
for you." 

" And you won't forget about the picture ? " 
" No. I won't forget that." ♦ 



 

The next morning he made ready for an early start, 
and in his preparations he had the zealous and even 
affectionate help of Jeff Durgin. The boy seemed to 
wish him to carry away the best impression of him, or 
at least to make him forget all that had been sinister 
or unpleasant in his behavior. They had been good 
comrades since the first evil day ; they had become 
good friends even ; and Westover was touched by the 
boy's devotion at parting. He helped the painter get 
his pack together in good shape, and he took pride in 
strapping it on Westover's shoulders, adjusting and 
readjusting it with care, and fastening it so that all 
should be safe and snug. He lingered about at the 
risk of being late for school, as if to see the last 
of the painter, and he waved his hat to him when 
Westover looked back at the house from half down 
the lane. Then he vanished, and Westover went 
slowly on till he reached that corner of the orchard 
where the slanting gravestones of the family burial- 
ground showed above the low wall. There, suddenly, 
a storm burst upon him. The air rained apples, that 
struck him on the head, the back, the side, and pelted 
in violent succession on his knapsack and canvases, 
camp-stool and easel. He seemed assailed by four or 
five skilful marksmen, whose missiles all told. 

When he could lift his face to look round, he heard 
a shrill, accusing voice, " Oh, Jeff Durgin ! " and he 
saw another storm of apples fly through the air tow- 
ard the little Whitwell girl, who dodged and ran along 
the road below, and escaped in the direction of the 
school-house. Then the boy's face showed itself over 



 

the top of one of the gravestones, all agrin with joy. 
He waited and watched Westover keep slowly on, as 
if nothing had happened, and presently he let some 
apples fall from his hands, and walked slowly back to 
the house, with his dog at his heels. 

When Westover reached the level of the road, and 
the shelter of the woods near Whitwell's house, he 
unstrapped his load to see how much harm had been 
done to his picture. He found it unhurt, and before 
he had got the burden back again, he saw JefE Durgin 
leaping along the road toward the school-house, whirl- 
ing his satchel of books about his head, and shouting 
gayly to the girl, now hidden by the bushes at the 
other end of the lane, " Cynthy ! Oh, Cynthy ! Wait 
for me ! I want to tell you something." 



IX. 

Westover received next spring the copy for an 
advertisement from Mrs. Durgin, which she asked to 
have him put in some paper for her. She said that 
her son Jackson had written it out, and Westover 
found it so well written that he had scarcely to change 
the wording. It offered the best of farm-board, with 
plenty of milk and eggs, berries and fruit, for five 
dollars a week at Lion's Head Farm, and it claimed for 
the farm the merit of the finest view of the celebrated 
Lion's Head Mountain. It was signed, as her letter 
was signed, " Mrs. J. M. Durgin," with her post-office 
address, and it gave Westover as a reference. 

The letter was in the same handwriting as the adver- 
tisement, which he took to be that of Jackson Durgin. 
It inclosed a dollar note to pay for three insertions of 
the advertisement in the Evening Transcript, and it 
ended, almost casually : " I do not know as you have 
heard that my husband, James Monroe Durgin, passed 
to spirit life this spring. My son will help me to run 
the house." 

This death could not move Westover more than it 



 

had apparently moved the widow. During the three 
weeks he had passed under his roof, he had scarcely 
exchanged three words with James Monroe Durgin, 
who remained to him an impression of large, round, 
dull blue eyes, a stubbly upper lip, and cheeks and 
chin tagged with coarse hay-colored beard. The im- 
pression was so largely the impression that he had 
kept of the dull blue eyes and the gaunt, slanted figure 
of Andrew Jackson Durgin that he could not be very 
distinct in his sense of which was now the presence, 
and which the absence. He remembered with an effort 
that the son's beard was straw-colored, but he had to 
make no effort to recall the robust effect of Mrs. Dur- 
gin and her youngest son. He wondered now, as he 
had often wondered before, whether she knew of the 
final violence which had avenged the boy for the pro- 
longed strain of repression Jeff had inflicted upon him- 
self during Westover's stay at the farm. After several 
impulses to go back and beat him, to follow him to 
school and expose him to the teacher, to write to his 
mother and tell her of his misbehavior, Westover had 
decided to do nothing. As he had come off unhurt in 
person and property, he could Afford to be more gen- 
erously amused than if he had suffered damage in 
either. The more he thought of the incident, the more 
he was disposed to be lenient with the boy, whom he 
was aware of having baffled and subdued by his supe- 
rior wit and virtue in perhaps intolerable measure. He
