observe that she was as pretty as their friend 
Littledale had promised. She was thirty years 
old, with the eyes and the smile of a girl of seventeen, and she was extremely light and graceful, 
elegant, exquisite. Mrs. Westgate was extremely 
spontaneous. She was very frank and demonstrative, and appeared always while she looked 
at you delightedly with her beautiful young eyes 
to be making sudden confessions and concessions, after momentary hesitations. 

" We shall expect to see a great deal of you," 
she said to Lord Lambeth, with a kind of joyous 
earnestness. " We are very fond of Englishmen 
here; that is, there are a great many we have 
been fond of. After a day or two you must come 
and stay with us ; we hope you will stay a long 
time. Newport 's a very nice place when you 
come really to know it, when you know plenty 
of people. Of course you and Mr. Beaumont 
will have no difficulty about that. Englishmen 
are very well received here ; there are almost always
two or three of them about. I think they 
always like it, and I must say I should think they 
would. They receive ever so much attention. I 
must say I think they sometimes get spoiled ; but 
I am sure you and Mr. Beaumont are proof against 
that. My husband tells me you are a friend of 
Captain Littledale ; he was such a charming man. 
He made himself most agreeable here, and I am 
sure I wonder he didn 't stay. It couldn 't have 
been pleasanter for him in his own country, 
though, I suppose, it is very pleasant in England, 
for English people. I don 't know myself ; I 
have been there very little. I have been a great 
deal abroad, but I am always on the Continent. 
I must say I'm extremely fond of Paris ; you 
know we Americans always are ; we go there 
when we die. Did you ever hear that before? 
that was said by a great wit, I mean the good 
Americans ; but we are all good ; you'll see that 
for yourself. All I know of England is London, 
and all I know of London is that place on that 
little corner, you know, where you buy jackets 
jackets with that coarse braid and those big buttons. They make very good jackets in London, 
I will do you the justice to say that. And some 
people like the hats ; but about the hats I was 
always a heretic ; I always got my hats in Paris. 
You can 't wear an English hat at least I never 
could unless you dress your hair d 'Anglaise ; 
and I must say that is a talent I have never 
possessed. In Paris they will make things to 
suit your peculiarities ; but in England I think 
you like much more to have how shall I say it ? 
one thing for every body. I mean as regards 
dress. I don 't know about other things ; but I 
have always supposed that in other things every 
thing was different. I mean according to the 
people according to the classes, and all that. I 
am afraid you will think that I don 't take a very 
favorable view ; but you know you can 't take a 
very favorable view in Dover Street in the month 
of November. That has always been my fate. 
Do you know Jones 's Hotel in Dover Street? 
That 's all I know of England. Of course every one admits that the English hotels are your 
weak point. There was always the most fright 
ful fog; I couldn 't see to try my things on. 
When I got over to America into the light 
I usually found they were twice too big. The 
next time I mean to go in the season ; I think 
I shall go next year. I want very much to take 
my sister; she has never been to England. I 
don 't know whether you know what I mean by 
eaying that the Englishmen who come here some 
times get spoiled. I mean that they take things 
as a matter of course things that are done for 
them. Now, naturally, they are only a matter of 
course when the Englishmen are very nice. But, 
of course, they are almost always very nice. Of 
course this isn't nearly such an interesting coun 
try as England ; there are not nearly so many 
things to see, and we haven 't your country life. 
I have never seen any thing of your country life ; 
when I am in Europe I am always on the Continent. But I have heard a great deal about it ; I 
know that when you are among yourselves in the 
country you have the most beautiful time. Of 
course we have nothing of that sort, we have 
nothing on that scale. I don 't apologize, Lord 
Lambeth ; some Americans are always apologizing ; you must have noticed that. We have the 
reputation of always boasting and bragging and 
waving the American flag ; but I must say that 
what strikes me is that we are perpetually making excuses, and trying to smooth things over. 
The American flag has quite gone out of fashion; it 's very carefully folded up, like an old 
table-cloth. Why should we apologize? The 
English never apologize do they ? Xo ; I must 
say I never apologize. You must take us as we 
come with all our imperfections on our heads. 
Of course we haven 't your country life, and your 
old ruins, and your great estates, and your leisure 
class, and ail that. But if we haven 't, I should 
think you might find it a pleasant change I think 
any country is pleasant where they have pleasant 
manners. Captain Littledale told me he had never seen such pleasant manners as at Newport, 
and he had been a great deal in European society. Hadn 't he been in the diplomatic service? 
He told me the dream of his life was to get ap 
pointed to a diplomatic post in Washington. But 
he doesn 't seem to have succeeded. I suppose 
that in England promotion and all that sort of 
thing is fearfully slow. With us, you know, it 's 
a great deal too fast. You see, I admit our draw 
backs. But I must confess I think Newport is 
an ideal place. I don 't know any thing like it 
any where. Captain Littledale told me he didn 't 
know any thing like it any where. It 's entirely 
different from most watering-places ; it 's a most 
charming life. I must say I think that when 
one goes to a foreign country one ought to en 
joy the differences. Of course there are differences, otherwise what did one come abroad for ? 
Look for your pleasure in the differences, Lord 
Lambeth ; that 's the way to do it ; and then I am 
sure you will find American society at least Newport society most charming and most interesting. I wish very much my husband were here ; but he 's dreadfully confined to New York. I 
suppose you think that is very strange for a 
gentleman. But you see we haven 't any leisure 
class." 

Mrs. "Westgate 's discourse, delivered in a soft, 
sweet voice, flowed on like a miniature torrent, 
and was interrupted by a hundred little smiles, 
glances, and gestures, which might have figured 
the irregularities and obstructions of such a 
stream. Lord Lambeth listened to her with, it 
must be confessed, a rather ineffectual attention, 
although he indulged in a good many little mur 
murs and ejaculations of assent and deprecation. 
He had no great faculty for apprehending gener 
alizations. There were some three or four indeed 
which, in the play of his own intelligence, he had 
originated, and which had seemed convenient at 
the moment ; but at the present time he could 
hardly have been said to follow Mrs. Westgate as 
she darted gracefully about in the sea of speculation. Fortunately she asked for no especial rejoinder, for she looked about at the rest of the 
company as well, and smiled at Percy Beaumont, 
on the other side of her, as if he too must understand her and agree with her. He was rather 
more successful than his companion ; for besides 
being, as we know, cleverer, his attention was not 
vaguely distracted by close vicinity to a remarkably interesting young girl, with dark hair and 
blue eyes. This was the case with Lord Lambeth, 
to whom it occurred after a while that the 
young girl with blue eyes and dark hair was the 
pretty sister of whom Mrs. Westgate had spoken. 
She presently turned to him with a remark which 
established her identity. 

" It 's a great pity you couldn 't have brought 
my brother-in-law with you. It 's a great shame 
he should be in New York in these days." 

" Oh yes ; it 's so very hot," said Lord Lambeth. 

" It must be dreadful," said the young girl. 

"I dare say he is very busy," Lord Lambeth 
observed. 

" The gentlemen in America work too much," 
the young girl went on. 

" Oh, do they ? I dare say they like it," said 
her interlocutor. 

" I don 't like it. One never sees them." 

"Don 't you, really?" asked Lord Lambeth. 
" I shouldn 't have fancied that." 

" Have you come to study American manners ?" 
asked the young girl. 

"Oh, I don 't know. I just came over for a 
lark. I haven 't got long." Here there was a 
pause, and Lord Lambeth began again. "But 
Mr. Westgate will come down here, will not he ?" 

"I certainly hope he will. He must help to 
entertain you and Mr. Beaumont." 





Lord Lambeth looked at her a little with his 
handsome brown eyes. "Do you suppose he 
would have come down with us if we had urged 
him ?" 

Mr. Westgate 's sister-in-law was silent a moment, and then, " I dare say he would," she answered. 

" Really !" said the young Englishman. " He 
was immensely civil to Beaumont and me," he 
added. 

"He is a dear good fellow," the young lady 
rejoined, " and he is a perfect husband. But all
