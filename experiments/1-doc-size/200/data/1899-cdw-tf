ever, not to be predicated of those who are famil- 
iar only with the great masterpieces of liter- 
ature, for if they are masterpieces, little or great, 
they exhibit human nature in all its aspects. 
And, further than this, it ought to be demonstra- 
ble, a priori^ that a mind fed on the best and 
not confused by the weak and diluted, or cor- 
rupted by images of the essentially vulgar and 
vile, would be morally healthy and best fitted to 
cope with the social problems of life. The Testa- 
ments reveal about everything that is known 
about human nature, but such is their clear, hiffh 
spirit, and their quality, that no one ever traced 
mental degeneration or low taste in literature, or 
want of virility in judgment, to familiarity with 
them. On the contrary, the most vigorous in- 
tellects have acknowledged their supreme in- 
debtedness to them. 

It is not likely that Philip made any such elab- 
orate analysis of the girl with whom he was in 
love, or attempted, except by a general reference 
to the method of her training, to account for the 
purity of her mind and her vigorous discernment. 
He was in love with her more subtle and hidden 
personality, with the girl just becoming a woman, 
with the mysterious sex that is the inspiration of 
most of the poetry and a good part of the hero- 
ism in the world. And he would have been in 




 

love with her, let her education have been what 
it might. He was in love before he heard her 
speak. And whatever she would say was bound 
to have a quality of interest and attraction that 
could be exercised by no other lips. It might be 
argued — a priori again, for the world is bound 
to go on in its own way — that there would be 
fewer marriages if the illusion of the sex did not 
suffice for the time to hide intellectual poverty, 
and, what is worse, ignobleness of disposition. 

It was doubtless fortunate for this particular 
love-making, though it did not seem so to Philip, 
that it was very much obstructed by lack of op- 
portunities, and that it was not impaired in its 
lustre by too much familiarity. In truth, Philip 
would have said that he saw very little of Evelyn, 
because he never saw her absolutely alone. To 
be sure he was much in her presence, a welcome 
member of the group that liked to idle on the 
veranda of the inn, and in the frequent excur- 
sions, in which Philip seemed to be the compan- 
ion of Mrs. Mavick rather than of her daughter. 
But she was never absent from his thought, his 
imagination was wholly captive to her image, 
and the passion grew in these hours of absence 
until she became an indispensable associate in all 
that he was or could ever hope to be. Alice, who 
discerned very clearly Mrs. Mavick and her am- 
bition, was troubled by Philip's absorption and 




 

the cruel disappointment in store for him. To 
her he was still the little boy, and all her tender- 
ness for him was stirred to shield him from the 
suffering she feared. 

But what could she do ? Philip liked to talk 
about Evelyn, to dwell upon her peculiarities and 
qualities, to hear her praised ; to this extent he 
was confidential with his cousin, but never in re- 
gard to his own feeling. That was a secret con- 
cerning which he was at once too humble and 
too confident to share with any other. None 
knew better than he the absurd presumption of 
aspiring to the hand of such a great heiress, and 
yet he nursed the vanity that no other man could 
ever appreciate and love her as he did. 

Alice was still more distracted and in sympathy 
with Philip's evident aspirations by her own love 
for Evelyn and her growing admiration for the 
girl's character. It so happened that mutual sym- 
pathy — who can say how it was related to Philip? 
— had drawn them much together, and chance 
had given them many opportunities for knowing 
each other. Alice had so far come out of her 
shell, and broken the reserve of her life, as to 
make frequent visits at the inn, and Mrs. Mavick 
and Evelyn found it the most natural and agree- 
able stroll by the river-side to the farm-house, 
where naturally, while the mother amused her- 
self with the original eccentricities of Pa- 




 

tience, her daughter grew into an intimacy with 
Alice. 

As for the feelings of Evelyn in these days — 
her first experience of something like freedom in 
the world — the historian has only universal ex- 
perience to guide him. In her heart was work- 
ing the consciousness that she had been singled 
out as worthy to share the confidence of a man 
in his most secret ambitions and aspirations, in 
the dreams of youth which seemed to her so 
noble. For these aspirations and dreams con- 
cerned the world in which she had lived most 
and felt most. If Philip had talked to her as he 
had to Oelia about his plans for success in life she 
would have been less interested. Eut there was 
nothing to warn, her personally in these un- 
worldly confessions. Nor did Philip ever seem 
to ask anything of her except sympathy in his 
ideas. And then there was the friendship of 
Alice, which could not but influence the girl. In 
the shelter of that the intercourse of the summer 
took on natural relations. For some natures 
there is no nurture of love like the security of 
family protection, under cover of which there is 
so little to excite the alarm of a timid maiden. 

It was fortunate for Philip that Miss McDon- 
ald took a liking to him. They were thrown 
much together. They were both good walkers, 
and liked to climb the hills and explore the wild 




 

mountain streams. Philip ^vould have confessed 
that he was fond of nature, and fancied there 
was a sort of superiority in his attitude towards 
it to that of his companion, who was merely in- 
terested in plants — just a botanist. This attitude, 
which she perceived, amused Miss McDonald. 

" If you American students," she said one day 
when they were seated on a fallen tree in the 
forest, and she was expatiating on a rare plant 
she had found, "paid no more attention to the 
classics than to the world you live in, few of you 
would get a degree." 

" Oh, some fellows go in for that sort of thing," 
Philip replied. "But I have noticed that all 
English women have some sort of fad — plants, 
shells, birds, something special." 

"Fad!" exclaimed the Scotchwoman. "Yes, 
I suppose it is, if reading is a fad. It is one way 
of finding out about things. You admire what 
the Americans call scenery; we, since you pro- 
voke me to say it, love nature — I mean its indi- 
vidual, almost personal manifestations. Every 
plant has a distinct character of its own. I 
saw the other day an American landscape pict- 
ure with a wild, uncultiv^ated foreground. There 
was not a botanical thing in it. The man who 
painted it didn't know a sweetbrier from a 
thistle. Just a confused mass of rubbish. It 
was as if an animal painter should compose 




 

a group and you could not tell whether it was 
made up of sheep or rabbits or dogs or foxes or 
griffins." 

" So, you want things picked out like a photo- 
graph ?" 

" I beg your pardon, I want nature. You can- 
not give character to a bit of ground in a land- 
scape unless you know the characters of its de- 
tails. A man is no more fit to paint a land- 
scape than a cage of monkeys, unless he knows
