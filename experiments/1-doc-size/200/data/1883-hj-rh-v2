" Cousin Sarah, the other evening," she said, "asked 
you to leave us to ourselves. I think she hardly knew 
what she was saying, and I hope you have not taken 
offence." 

"By no means ; but I honestly believe that my leav 
ing you would contribute greatly to Mrs. Hudson 's comfort. I can be your hidden providence, you know ; I 
can watch you at a distance and come upon the scene at 
critical moments." 

The girl looked for a moment at the ground ; and 
then, with sudden earnestness, " I want you to come 
with us !" she said. 

It need hardly be added that after this Rowland went 
with them. 



XXIII. 

ROWLAND had a very friendly memory of a little moun 
tain inn, accessible with moderate trouble from Lucerne, 
where he had once spent a blissful ten days. He had at 
that time been trudging, knapsack on back, over half 
Switzerland, and not being a particularly light weight 
on his legs it was no shame to him to confess that he 
was mortally tired. The inn of which I speak presented 
striking analogies with a cow-stable ; but in spite of this 
circumstance it was crowded with hungry tourists. It 
stood in a high shallow valley, with flower-strewn Alpine 
meadows sloping down to it from the base of certain 
rugged rocks whose outlines were grotesque against the 
evening sky. Rowland had seen grander places in 
Switzerland that pleased him less, and whenever after 
wards he wished to think of Alpine opportunities at their 
best he recalled this grassy concave among the higher 
ridges, and the August days he spent there, resting 
deliciously at his length in the lee of a sun-warmed 



 

boulder, with the light cool air stirring about his temples, 
the wafted odours of the pines in his nostrils, the tinkle 
of the cattle-bells in his ears, the vast progression of the 
mountain shadows before his eyes, and a volume of 
Wordsworth in his pocket. His face, on the Swiss hill 
sides, had been scorched to a brilliant hue, and his bed 
was a pallet in a loft, which he shared with a German 
botanist of colossal stature every inch of him quaking 
at an open window. These had been drawbacks to 
felicity, but Rowland hardly cared whether or how he 
was lodged, for he spent the livelong day under the sky, 
on the crest of a slope that looked at the Jungfrau. He 
remembered all this on leaving Florence with his friends, 
and he reflected that, as the midseason was over, accommodations would be more ample and charges more modest. 
He communicated with his old friend the landlord, and 
while September was yet young his companions estab 
lished themselves under his guidance in the grassy valley. 
He had crossed the Saint Gothard Pass with them in 
the same vehicle. During the journey from Florence, 
and especially during this portion of it, the cloud that 
hung over the little party had been almost dissipated, 
and they had looked at each other, in the close intimacy 
of the train and the posting carriage, without either 
retributive or argumentative glances. It was impossible 
not to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Apennines 
and the Italian Alps, and there was a tacit agreement 
among the travellers to abstain from sombre allusions. 
The effect of this delicate compact seemed excellent ; it 
ensured them a week 's intellectual sunshine. Roderick 
sat and gazed out of the windpw with a fascinated stare, 
and with a perfect docility of attitude. He concerned 
himself not a particle about the itinerary or about any 
of the wayside arrangements ; he took no trouble and 
he gave none. He assented to everything that was pro 
posed, talked very little, and led for a week a perfectly 
contemplative life. His mother rarely removed her eyes 



 

from him ; and if a while before this would greatly have 
irritated him, he now seemed perfectly unconscious of 
her observation, and profoundly indifferent to anything 
that might befall him. They spent a couple of days 
on the Lake of Como, at an hotel with white porticoes 
smothered in oleander and myrtle, and terrace steps lead 
ing down to little boats with striped awnings. They 
agreed it was the earthly paradise, and they passed the 
mornings strolling through the cedarn alleys of classic 
villas, and the evenings floating in the moonlight in a 
circle of outlined mountains, to the music of silver-trickling oars. One day, in the afternoon, the two young 
men took a long stroll together. They followed the 
winding footway that led towards Como, close to the 
lake side, past the gates of villas and the walls of vine 
yards, through little hamlets propped on a dozen arches, 
and bathing their feet and their pendent tatters in the 
gray -green ripple ; past frescoed walls and crumbling 
campaniles and grassy village piazzas and the mouth of 
soft ravines that wound upward through belts of swinging vine and vaporous olive and splendid chestnut, to 
high ledges where white chapels gleamed amid the paler 
boskage, and bare cliff surfaces, with their blistered lips, 
drank in the liquid light. It all was consummately 
picturesque ; it was the Italy that we know from the 
steel engravings in old keepsakes and annuals, from 
the vignettes on music sheets and the drop-curtains at 
theatres ; an Italy that we can never confess ourselves 
in spite of our own changes and of Italy 's that we 
have ceased to believe. Rowland and Roderick turned 
aside from the little paved footway that clambered and 
dipped and wound and doubled beside the lake, and 
stretched themselves idly beneath a fig-tree on a grassy 
promontory. Rowland had never known anything so 
divinely soothing as the dreamy softness of that early 
autumn afternoon. The iridescent mountains shut him 
in ; the little waves beneath him fretted the white pebbles 



 

at the laziest intervals ; the festooned vines above him 
swayed just visibly in the all but motionless air. 

Roderick lay observing it all with his arms thrown 
back and his hands under his head. "This suits me," 
he said ; I could be happy here and forget everything. 
Why not stay here for ever?" He kept his position for 
a long time, and seemed lost in his thoughts. Rowland 
spoke to him, but he made vague answers ; at last he 
closed his eyes. It seemed to Rowland also a place to 
stay in for ever ; a place for perfect oblivion of the 
disagreeable. Suddenly Roderick turned over on his 
face and buried it in his arms. There had been some 
thing passionate in his movement ; but Rowland was 
nevertheless surprised when he at last jerked himself 
back into a sitting posture, to perceive the trace of tears 
in his eyes. Roderick turned to his friend, stretching 
his two hands out towards the lake and mountains, and 
shaking them with an eloquent gesture, as if his heart 
had been too full for utterance. 

" Pity me, my friend ; pity me !" he presently cried. 
Look at this lovely world, and think what it must be 
to be dead to it ! " 

"Dead?" said Rowland. 

" Dead, dead ; dead and buried ! Buried in an open 
grave, where you lie staring up at the sailing clouds, 
smelling the waving flowers, and hearing all nature live 
and grow above you ! That 's the way I feel ! " 

"I am glad to hear it," said Rowland. "Death of 
that sort is very near to resurrection." 

"It 's too horrible," Roderick went on; "it has all 
come over me here ! If I were not ashamed I could 
shed a bushel of tears. For one hour of what I have 
been I would give up anything I may be !" 

"Never mind what you have been; be something 
better ! " 

" I shall never be anything again ; it 's no use talking ! 
But I don 't know what secret spring has been touched 



since I have lain here. Something in my heart seems 
suddenly to open and let in a flood of beauty and desire. 
I know what I have lost, and I think it horrible ! Mind 
you, I know it, I feel it ! Remember that hereafter. 
Don 't say that he was stupefied and senseless ; that his 
perception was dulled, and his aspiration dead. Say that 
he trembled in every nerve with a sense of the beauty 
and sweetness of life ; that he rebelled, and protested, 
and struggled ; that he was buried alive, with his eyes 
open, and his heart beating to madness ; that he clung 
to every blade of grass and every wayside thorn as he 
passed ; that it was the most pitiful spectacle you ever 
beheld ; that it was a scandal, an outrage, a murder ! " 

"Good heavens, man, are you insane?" Rowland 
cried. 

" I have never been saner. I don 't want to be bad 
company, and in this beautiful spot, at this delightful 
hour, it seems an outrage to break the charm. But I 
am bidding farewell to Italy, to beauty, to honour, to 
life I I only want to assure you that I know what I 
lose. I know it in every pulse of my heart ! Here, 
where these things are all loveliest, I take leave of them. 
Good-bye, charming world ! "
