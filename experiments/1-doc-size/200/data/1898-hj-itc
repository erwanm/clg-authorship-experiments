Do, do hunt it up ! he repeated. 

I dare say we could get it for you, the 
girl sweetly returned. 

Get it ? he looked aghast. When ? 

Probably by to-morrow. 

Then it isn' t here? his face was pitiful. 

She caught only the uncovered gleams 
that peeped out of the blackness, and she 
wondered what complication, even among 
the most supposable, the very worst, could 
be bad enough to account for the degree 
of his terror. There were twists and turns, 
there were places where the screw drew 
blood, that she couldn't guess. She was 
more and more glad she didn' t want to. It 
has been sent on. 

But how do you know if you don't look? 

She gave him a smile that was meant to 
be, in the absolute irony of its propriety, 
quite divine. It was August 23rd, and we 
have nothing later here than August 27th. 

Something leaped into his face. 27th 
23rd? Then you're sure? You know? 

She felt she scarce knew what as if she 
might soon be pounced upon for some lurid 
connection with a scandal. It was the 
queerest of all sensations, for she had heard, 
she had read, of these things and the wealth 
of her intimacy with them at Cocker 's might 
be supposed to have schooled and seasoned 
her. This particular one that she had really 
quite lived with was, after all, an old story ; 
yet what it had been before was dim and 
distant beside the touch under which she 
now winced. Scandal? it had never been 
but a silly word. Now it was a great palpa 
ble surface, and the surface was somehow, 
Captain Everhard 's wonderful face. Deep 
down in his eyes was a picture, the vision of 
a great place like a chamber of justice, 
where, before a watching crowd, a poor girl, 
exposed but heroic, swore with a quavering 





voice to a document, proved an alibi, sup 
plied a link. In this picture she bravely 
took her place. It was the 23rd. 

Then can't you get it this morning or 
some time to-day? 

She considered, still holding him with her 
look, which she then turned on her two 
companions, who were by this time unre 
servedly enlisted. She didn' t care not a 
scrap, and she glanced about for a piece of 
paper. With this she had to recognize the 
rigour of official thrift a morsel of black 
ened blotter was the only loose paper to be 
seen. Have you got a card? she said to 
her visitor. He was quite away from Pad- 
dington now, and the next instant, with a 
pocket-pook in his hand, he had whipped a 
card out. She gave no glance at the name 
on it only turned it to the other side. She 
continued to hold him, she felt at present, as 
she had never held him ; and her command 
of her colleagues was, for the moment, not 
less marked. She wrote something on the 
back of the card and pushed it across to him.

He fairly glared at it. Seven, nine, 
four 

Nine, six, one she obligingly completed 
the number. Is it right? she smiled. 

He took the whole thing in with a flushed 
intensity; then there broke out in him a 
visibility of relief that was simply a tremen 
dous exposure. He shone at them all like 
a tall lighthouse, embracing even, for sym 
pathy, the blinking young man. By all the 
powers it 's wrong! And without another 
look, without a word of thanks, without 
time for anything or anybody, he turned on 
them the broad back of his great stature, 
straightened his triumphant shoulders and 
strode out of the place. 

She was left confronted with her habitual 
critics. "If it 's wrong it 's all right!" she 
extravagantly quoted to them. 

The counter-clerk was really awe-stricken. 
But how did you know, dear? 

I remembered, love! 

Mr. Buckton, on the contrary, was rude. 
And what game is that, Miss? 





No happiness she had ever known came 
within miles of it, and some minutes elapsed 
before she could recall herself sufficiently 
to reply that it was none of his business. 



XXIV 

If life at Cocker 's with the dreadful drop 
of August, had lost something of its savour, 
she had not been slow to infer that a heavier 
blight had fallen on the graceful industry of 
Mrs. Jordan. With Lord Rye and Lady 
Ventnor and Mrs. Bubb all out of town, 
with the blinds down on all the homes of 
luxury, this ingenious woman might well 
have found her wonderful taste left quite on 
her hands. She bore up, however, in a way 
that began by exciting much of her young 
friend 's esteem; they perhaps even more 
frequently met as the wine of life flowed 
less free from other sources, and each, in 
the lack of better diversion, carried on with 
more mystification for the other an inter 
course that consisted not a little of peeping 
out and drawing back. Each waited for 
the other to commit herself, each profusely 

curtained for the other the limits of low 






horizons. Mrs. Jordan was indeed probably 
the more reckless skirmisher ; nothing could 
exceed her frequent incoherence unless it 
was indeed her occasional bursts of con 
fidence. Her account of her private affairs 
rose and fell like a flame in the wind 
sometimes the bravest bonfire and some 
times a handful of ashes. This our young 
woman took to be an effect of the position, 
at one moment and another, of the famous 
door of the great world. She had been 
struck in one of her ha penny volumes with 
the translation of a French proverb accord 
ing to which a door had to be either open or 
shut; and it seemed a part of the precari- 
ousness of Mrs. Jordan 's life that hers mostly 
managed to be neither. There had been 
occasions when it appeared to gape wide 
fairly to woo her across its threshold ; there 
had been others, of an order distinctly dis 
concerting, when it was all but banged in 
her face. On the whole, however, she had 
evidently not lost heart ; these still belonged 
to the class of things in spite of which she 





looked well. She intimated that the profits 
of her trade had swollen so as to float her 
through any state of the tide, and she had, 
besides this, a hundred profundities and 
explanations. 

She rose superior, above all, on the happy 
fact that there were always gentlemen in 
town and that gentlemen were her greatest 
admirers ; gentlemen from the city in 
especial as to whom she was full of in 
formation about the passion and pride 
excited in such breasts by the objects of
