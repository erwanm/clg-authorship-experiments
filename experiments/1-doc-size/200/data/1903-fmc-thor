" When a man has such a voice as that, it is impos- 
sible not to hear him," said Malipieri, rising and 
answering before Sabina had time to speak. 

Sabina rose, too, rather reluctantly. 

" And of course you agreed with everything 
he said," the Baroness replied. " All anarchists 
do!" 

"I beg your pardon. I do not agree with him at 
all, and I am really not an anarchist." 

He smiled politely, and Sabina noticed with an un- 
accountable little thrill of satisfaction that the smile 
was quite different from the one she had seen in his 
face more than once while they had been talking to- 
gether. As for the deputy's discourse, she had not 
heard a word of it. ' 





The Baroness sat down on the sofa, and Sabina 
slipped away. She was not supposed to be in society 
yet, as she was not quite eighteen, and there was cer- 
tainly no reason why she should stay in the drawing- 
room that evening, while there were many reasons why 
she should go away. The Baroness breathed an audible 
sigh of relief when she was gone, for it was never pos- 
sible to predict what some excited politician might say 
before her in the heat of argument. 

In the silence of her own room she sat down to 
think over the unexpected events of the evening. 
Very young girls love to look forward to the mo- 
ment when they shall be able to " think " of what 
has happened, after they have met men they are in- 
clined to like, and who interest them. But when 
the time really comes they hardly ever think at all. 
They see pictures, they hear voices, they feel again 
what they have felt, they laugh, they shed tears all 
alone, and they believe they are thinking, or even 
reasoning. Their little joys come back to them, the 
little triumphs of their vanity, and also all the little 
hurts their sensitiveness has suffered, and which men 
do not often guess and still more rarely under- 
stand. 

There must be some original reason why all boys 
call girls silly, and all girls think boys stupid. It 
must be part of the first manifestation of that enor- 
mous difference which exists between the point of 
view of men and women in after life. 

Women are, in a sense, the embodiment of practice. 



 

while men are the representatives of theory. In 
practice, in a race for life, the runner who jumps 
everything in his way is always right, unless he 
breaks his neck. In theory, he is as likely to break 
his neck at the first jump as at the second, and the 
chances of his coming to grief increase quickly, 
always in theory, as he grows tired. So theory says 
that it is safer never to jump at all, but to go round 
through the gates, or wade ignominiously through 
the water. Women jump ; men go round. The dif- 
ference is everything. Women believe in what often 
succeeds in practice, and they take all risks and 
sometimes come down with a crash. Men theorize 
about danger, make elaborate calculations to avoid it 
and occasionally stick in the mud. When women 
fall at a stone wall they scream, when men are stuck 
in a bog they swear. The difference is fundamental. 
In nine cases out of ten it is the woman who enjoys 
the ecstatic delight of saying "I told you so," and 
there are plenty of women who would ask no greater 
joy in paradise than to say so to their husbands for 
ever and ever. Indeed, eternal reward and punish- 
ment could thus be at once combined and distributed 
in a simple manner. 

Sabina took her first fence that evening, for when 
she put out her candle she was sure that Malipieri 
was already her friend, and that she could trust him 
in any emergency. Moreover, though she would not 
have acknowledged it, she inwardly hoped that some 
emergency might not be far in the future. 





But Malipieri walked all the way from the Via 
Ludovisi to the Palazzo Conti, which is more than a 
mile, without noticing that he had forgotten to light 
the cigar he had taken out on leaving Volterra's 
house. 



CHAPTER VI 

Malzpieki had the Palazzo Conti to himself. The 
main entrance was always shut now, and only a small 
postern, cut in one side, of the great door, was left 
ajar. The porter loafed about in the great court 
with his broom and his pipe; in the morning his 
wife went upstairs and opened a few windows, merely 
as a formality, and late in the afternoon she shut 
them again. Malipieri's man generally went out 
twice every day, carrying a military dinner-pail, 
made in three sections, which he brought back half 
an hour later. Malipieri sometimes was not seen for 
several days, but frequently he went out in the 
morning and did not come back till dark. Now and 
then, things were delivered for him at the door, â€” a 
tin of oil for his lamps, a large box of candles, pack- 
ages of odd shapes, sometimes very heavy, and which 
the porter was told to handle with care. 

The old man tried to make acquaintance Tvith 
Malipieri's man, but foun'd it less easy than he had 
expected. In the first place, Masin came from some 
outlandish part of Italy where an abominable dialect 
was spoken, and though he could speak school Italian 
when he pleased, he chose to talk to the porter in 
his native jargon, when he talked at all. He might 







just as well have spoken Greek. Secondly, he re- 
fused the porter's repeated offers of a litre at the 
wine shop, always saying something which sounded 
like a reference to his delicate health. As he was 
evidently as strong as an ox, and as healthy as a 
savage or a street dog, the excuse carried no convic- 
tion. He was a hig, quiet fellow, with china-blue 
eyes and a reddish moustache. The porter was not 
used to such people, nor to servants who wore mous- 
taches, and was inclined to distrust the man. On 
the other hand, though Masin would not drink, he 
often gave the porter a cigar, with a friendly smile. 
One day, in the morning. Baron Volterra came to 
see Malipieri, and stayed over an hour, a part of 
which time the two men spent in the courtyard, 
walking up and down in the north-west corner, and 
then taking some measurements with a long tape 
which Malipieri produced from his pocket. When 
the Baron went away he stopped and spoke with the 
porter. First he gave him five francs ; then he in- 
formed him that his wages would be raised in future 
by that amount; and finally he told him that Signor 
Malipieri was an architect and would superintend the 
repairs necessary to the foundations at the north-west 
corner, that while the woA; was going on even the 
little postern door was to be kept shut all day, and 
no one was to be admitted on any condition without 
Signor Malipieri's express permission. The fat Baron 
fixed his eyes on the porter's with an oddly hard 
look, and said that he himself might come at any 



 

moment to see how the work was going on, and that 
if he found anybody inside the gate without Signor 
Malipieri's authority, it would be bad for the porter. 
During this conversation, Malipieri stood listening, 
and when it ended he nodded, as if he were satisfied, 
and after shaking hands with the Baron he went up 
the grand staircase without a word. 

It was all very mysterious, and the porter shook his 
head as he turned into his lodge after fastening the 
postern ; but he said nothing to his wife about what 
had passed. 

From what he had been told, he now naturally ex- 
pected that a number of masons would come in a day 
or two in order to begin the work of strengthening the 
foundations ; but no one came, and everything went 
on as usual, except that the postern was kept shut. 
He supposed that Malipieri was not ready, but he 
wisely abstained from asking questions. Then Mali- 
pieri asked him for the address of Pompeo Sassi, . 
and wrote it down in his pocket-book, and went out. 
That was on the morning after he had dined at the 
Baron's house, for it was not his habit to waste time
