answered. "There may be something more." 

" No, she has been alone with the monster, all these 
centuries. I am sure of it. There cannot be anything 
else." 

"We had better look, nevertheless," said Malipieri. 
" I want you to see everything there is, and you cannot 
come here again — not in this way." 

" Well, let us go round." Sabina moved. 

" Besides," continued Malipieri, going slowly forward 
and lighting the way, " I am going to leave the palace 
the day after to-morrow." 

" Why ? " asked Sabina, in surprise. 



 

" Because Volterra has requested me to go. I may 
have to leave Rome altogether." 

» Leave Rome ? " 

Her own voice sounded harsh to her as she spoke 
the words. She had been so sure that he was in love 
with her, she had begun to know that she would soon 
love him ; and he was going away already. 

" Perhaps," he answered, going on. " I am not 
sure." 

" But — " Sabina checked herself and bit her lip. 

" What ? " 

"Nothing, Go on, please. It must be getting late." 

There was nothing more in the vault. They went all 
round the gilt statue without speaking, came back to 
the feet of the Aphrodite from the further side and 
stopped to look again. Still neither spoke for a long 
time. Malipieri held the light's in several positions, 
trying to find the best. 

" Why must you leave Rome ? " Sabina asked, at 
last, without turning her face to him. 

"I am not sure that I must. I said I might, that 
was all." 

Sabina tapped the ground impatiently with her foot. 

" Why ' may ' you have to go, then ? " she asked a 
little sharply. 

"Volterra may be able to drive me away. He will 
try, because he is afraid I may wish to get a share in 
the discovery." 

" Oh ! Then you will not leave Rome, unless you 
are driven away ? " 





Malipieri tried to see her eyes, but she looked steadily 
down at the statue. 

" No," he said. « Certainly not." 

Sabina said nothing, but her expression changed and 
softened at once. He could see that, even in the play 
of the shadows. She raised her head, glanced at him, 
and moved to go on. After making a few steps in the 
direction of the aperture she stopped suddenly as if 
listening. Mallpieri held his breath, and then he 
heard, too. 

It was the unmistakable sound of water trickling 
faster and faster over stones. For an instant his 
blood stood still. Then he set the lamp down, grasped 
Sabina's wrist and hurried her along, carrying only the 
lantern. 

" Come as fast as you can," he said, controlling his 
voice. 

She understood that there was danger and obeyed 
without losing her head. As he helped her up through 
the hole in the vault, she felt herself very light in hie 
hands. In a moment he was beside her, and they were 
hurrying towards the inclined passage, bending low. 



CHAPTER XIV 

A BEOAD stream of water was pouring down, and 
spreading on each side in the space between the vaults. 
In a flash, Malipieri understood. The dry well had 
filled, but the overflow shaft was covered with the 
weighted boards, and only a little water could get 
down through the cracks. The rest was pouring 
down the passage, and would soon fill the vault, 
which was at a much lower level. 

" Stay here ! Do not move ! " 

Sabina stood still, but she trembled a little, as he 
dashed up through the swift, shallow stream, not 
ankle deep, but steady as fate. In a moment he had 
disappeared from her sight, and she was all alone in 
the dismal place, in darkness, save for a little light 
that forced its way up from below through the hole. 
It seemed five minutes before his plashing footsteps 
stopped, up there in the passage ; then came instantly 
the noise of stones thrown aside into the water, and 
of heavy pieces of board grating and bumping, as 
they floated for a moment. Almost instantly a loud 
roar came from the same direction, as the inflowing 
stream from the well thundered down the shaft. 
Sabina heard Malipieri's voice calling to her, and his 
approaching footsteps. 







" The water cannot reach you now ! " he cried. 

It had already stopped running down the passage, 
when Malipieri emerged, dripping and holding out 
the lantern in front of him, as his feet slipped on 
the wet stones. Sabina was very pale, but quite 
quiet. 

" What has happened ? " she asked mechanically. 

" The water has risen suddenly," he said, paler than 
she, for he knew the whole danger. " We cannot 
get out till it goes down." 

" How soon will that be ? " Sabina asked steadily. 

"I do not know." 

They looked at each other, and neither spoke for a 
moment. 

"Do you think it may be several hours?" asked 
Sabina. 

"Yes, perhaps several hours." 

Something in his tone told her that matters might 
be worse than that. 

" Tell me the truth," she said. " It may be days 
before the water goes down. We may die here. Is 
that what you mean ? " 

" Unless I can make another way out, that is what 
may happen. We may starve here." 

"You will find the other way out," Sabina said 
quietly. "I know you will." 

She would rather have died that moment than have 
let him think her a coward ; and she was really brave, 
and was vaguely conscious that she was, and that she 
could trust her nerves, as long as her bodily strength 



 

lasted. But it would be very horrible to die of hunger, 
and in such a place. It was better not to think of 
it. He stood before her, with his lantern, a pale, 
courageous, strong man, whom she could not help 
trusting ; he would find that other way. 

" You had better get down again," he said, after a 
little reflection. " It is dry below, and the lamp is there." 

" I can help you." 

Malipieri looked at the slight figure and the little 
gloved hands and smiled. 

" I am very strong," Sabina said, " much stronger 
than you think. Besides, I could not sit all alone 
down there while you are groping about. The water
