The Mutiny broke out so suddenly, and spread with such 

rapidity that there was but little time for occupants of weak 

outlying stations to escape to places of safety. Attempts were 

made, of course, but they were attended by hardships as bitter 

as death in the few cases which were successful ; for the heat 

ranged between 120 and 138 in the shade ; the way led through 

hostile peoples, and food and water were hardly to be had. 

For ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and 

plenty, such a journey must have been a cruel experience. 

Sir G. O. Trevelyan quotes an example : 

"This is what befell Mrs. M , the wife of the surgeon at a certain 

station on the southern confines of the insurrection. ' I heard,' she says, 'a 
number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw my husband driving furiously 
from the mess-house, waving his whip. I ran to him, and, seeing a bearer 
with my child in his arms, I caught her up, and got into the buggy. At the 
mess-house we found all the officers assembled, together with sixty sepoys, 
who had remained faithful. We went off in one large party, amidst a general 
conflagration of our late homes. We reached the caravanserai at Chattapore 
the next morning, and thence started for Callinger. At this point our sepoy 
escort deserted us. We were fired upon by matchlockmen, and one officer was 
shot dead. We heard, likewise, that the people had risen at Callinger, so we 

returned and walked back ten miles that day. M and I carried the child 

alternately. Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke. We had no food 
amongst us. An officer kindly lent us a horse. We were very faint. The 
Major died, and was buried ; also the Sergeant-major and some women. The 
bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June. We were fired at again by match- 
lockmen, and changed direction for Allahabad. Our party consisted of nine 
gentlemen, two children, the sergeant and his wife. On the morning of the 
twentieth. Captain Scott took Lottie on to his horse. I was riding behind my 
husband, and she was so crushed between us. She was two years old on the 
first of the month. We were both ,weak through want of food and the effect 

of the sun. Lottie and I had no head covering. M had a sepoy's cap I 

found on the ground. Soon after sunrise we were followed by villagers 
armed with clubs and spears. One of them struck Captain Scott's horse on 
the leg. He galloped off with Lottie, and my poor husband never, saw his 
child again. We rode on several miles, keeping away from villages, and then 

crossed the river. Our thirst was extreme. M had dreadful cramps, so • 

that I had to hold him on the horse. I was very uneasy about him. The day 
before I saw the drummer's wife eating chupatties, and asked her to give a 
piece to the child, which she did. I now saw water in a ravine. The 

descent was steep, and our only drinking-vessel was M 's cap. Our horse 

got water, and I bathed my neck. I had no stockings, and my feet were torn 
and blistered. Two peasants came in sight, and we were frightened and rode 
off. The sergeant held our horse, and M put me up and mounted. I think 

he must have got suddenly faint, for I fell and he over me, on the road, when 
the horse started off. Some time before he said, and Barber, too, that he 
could not live many hours. I felt he was dying before we came to the ravine. 
He told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took leave. My 
brain seemed burnt up. No tears came. As soon as we fell, the sergeant let 
go the horse, and it went off ; so that escape was cut off. We sat down on 
the ground waiting for death. Poor fellow ! he was very weak ; his thirst 
was frightful, and I went to get him water. Some villagers came, and took 
my rupees and watch. I took off my wedding-ring, and twisted it in my 
hair, and replaced the guard. I tore off the skirt of my dress to bring water 
in, but was no use, for when I returned my beloved's eyes were fixed, and, 
though I called and tried to restore him, and poured water into his mouth, it 
only rattled in his throat. He never spoke to me again. I held him in my 
arms till he sank gradually down. I felt frantic, but could not cry. I was 
alone. I bound his head and face in my dress, for there was no earth to bury 
him. The pain in my hands and feet was dreadful. I went down to the 
ravine, and sat in the water on a stone, hoping to get off at night and look for 
Lottie. When I came back from the water, I saw that they had not taken 
her little watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat. In an 
hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the ravine, and 
took off my jacket, and found the little chain. They then dragged me to a 
village, mocking me all the way, and disputing as to whom I was to belong 
to. The whole population came to look at me. I asked for a bedstead, and 
lay down outside the door of a hut. They had a dozen of cows, and yet 
refused me milk. When night came, and the village was quiet, some old 
woman brought me a leafful of rice. I was too parched to eat, and they 
gave me water. The morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin 
and a horseman to fetch me, who told me that a little child and three Sahibs 
had come to his master's house. And so the poor mother found her lost one, 
'greatly blistered,' poor little creature. It is not for Europeans in India to 
pray that their flight be not in the winter." 

In the first days of June the aged general, Sir Hugh 

Wheeler commanding the forces at Cawnpore, was deserted by 

his native troops ; then he moved out of the fort and into an 

exposed patch of open flat ground and built a four-foot mud 

wall around it. He had with him a few hundred white 

soldiers and officers, and apparently more women and children 

than soldiers. He was short of provisions, short of arms, short 

of ammunition, short of military wisdom, short of everything 

but courage and devotion to duty. The defense of that open 

lot through twenty-one days and nights of hunger, thirst, 

Indian heat, and a never-ceasing storm of bullets, bombs, and 

cannon-balls — a defense conducted, not by the aged and infirm 
general, but by a young officer named Moore — is one of the 
most heroic episodes in history. When at last the Nana found 
it impossible to conquer these starving men and women with 
powder and ball, he resorted to treachery, and that succeeded. 
He agreed to supply them with food and send them to 
Allahabad in boats. Their mud wall and their barracks were 
in ruins, their provisions were at the point of exhaustion, they 
had done all that the brave could do, they had conquered an 
honorable compromise, their forces had been fearfully reduced 
by casualties and by disease, they were not able to continue 
the contest longer. They came forth helpless but suspecting 
no treachery, the Nana's host closed around them, and at a 
signal from a trumpet the massacre began. About two 
hundred women and children were spared — for the present — 
but all the men except three or four were killed. Among the 
incidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan, is 

this: 

"When, after the lapse of some twenty minutes, the dead began to out- 
number the living ; — when the fire slackened, as the marks grew few and far 
between ; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the right of the temple 
plunged into the river, sabre between teeth, and pistol in hand. Thereupon 
two half-caste Christian women, the wives of musicians in the band of the 
Fifty-sixth, witnessed a scene which should not be related at second-hand. 
' In the boat where I was to have gone,' says Mrs. Bradshaw, confirmed 
throughout by Mrs. Setts, ' was the school-mistress and twenty -two misses. 
General Wheeler came last in a palkee. They carried him into the water 
near the boat. I stood close by. He said, ' Carry me a little further towards 
the boat.' But a trooper said, ' No, get out here.' As the General got out of 
the palkee, headforemost, the trooper gave him a cut with his sword into the 
neck, and he fell into the water. My son was killed near him. I saw it ; 
alas! alas! Some were stabbed with bayonets; others cut down. Little in- 
fants were torn in pieces. We saw it; we did; and tell you only what we 
saw. Other children were stabbed and thrown into the river. The school- 
girls were burnt to death. I saw their clothes and hair catch fire. In the 
water, a few paces off, by the next boat, we saw the youngest daughter of 
Colonel Williams. A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet. She 
said, 'My father was always kind to sepoys.' He turned away, and just 
then a villager struck her on the head with a club, and she fell into the water. 
These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff, the clergyman, take a book 

from his pocket that he never had leisure to open, and heard him commence 
a prayer for mercy which he was not permitted to conclude. Another de- 
ponent observed an European making for a drain like a scared water-rat, 
when some boatmen, armed with cudgels, cut off his retreat, and beat him 
down dead into the mud." 

The women and children who had been reserved from the 
massacre were imprisoned during a fortnight in a small build- 
ing, one story high — a cramped place, a slightly modified 
Black Hole of Calcutta. They were waiting in suspense; 
there was none who could forecaste their fate. Meantime the 
news of the massacre had traveled far and an army of rescuers 
with Havelock at its head was on its way — at least an army 
which hoped to be rescuers. It was crossing the country by 
forced marches, and strewing its way with its own dead — 
men struck down by cholera, and by a heat which reached 
135°. It was in a vengeful fury, and it stopped for nothing — 
neither heat, nor fatigue, nor disease, nor human opposition. 
It tore its impetuous way through hostile forces, winning vic- 
tory after victory, but still striding on and on, not halting to 
count results. And at last, after this extraordinary march, it 
arrived before the walls of Cawnpore, met the Nana's massed 
strength, delivered a crushing defeat, and entered. 

But too late — only a few hours too late. For at the last 

moment- the Nana had decided upon the massacre of the 

captive women and children, and had commissioned three 

Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work. Sir G. O, 

Trevelyan says : 

"Thereupon the five men entered. It was the short gloaming of Hindo- 
stan — the hour when ladies take their evening drive. She who had accosted 
the officer was standing in the doorway. With her were the native doctor 
and two Hindoo menials. That much of the business might be seen from the
