a flood of white-hot Italian lava, and the next moment he was 
bowing, and the soldier and I were moving in procession again

CHAPTEK XXI. 

Man will do many things to get himself loved, he will do all things to get 
himself envied. — Paddti'head Wilsori's New Calendar. 

BEFORE I saw Australia I had never heard of the 
" weet-weet " at all. I met but few men who had seen 
it thrown — at least I met but few who mentioned 
having seen it thrown. Roughly described, it is a fat wooden 
cigar with its butt-end fastened to a flexible twig. The whole 
thing is only a couple of feet long, and weighs less than two 
ounces. This feather — so to call it — is not thrown through 
the air, but is flung with an underhanded throw and made to 
strike the ground a little way in front of the thrower ; then it 
glances and makes a long skip ; glances again, skips again, and 
again and again, like the flat stone which a boy sends skating 
over the water. The water is smooth, and the stone has a 
good chance; so a strong man may make it travel fifty or 
seventy-five yards ; but the weet-weet has no such good chance, 
for it strikes sand, grass, and earth in its course. Yet an 
expert aboriginal has sent it a measured distance of two 
hundred and twenty yards. It would have gone even further 
but it encountered rank ferns and underwood on its passage 
and they damaged its speed. Two hundred and twenty yards ; 
and so weightless a toy — a mouse on the end of a bit of wire, 
in effect ; and not sailing through the accomodating air, but 
encountering grass and sand and stuff at every jump. It looks 
wholly impossible ; but Mr. Brough Smyth saw the feat and 
did the measuring, and set down the facts in his book about 
aboriginal life, which he wrote by command of the Victorian 
Government. 



"What is the secret of the feat? No one explains. It 
cannot be physical sti-ength, for that could not drive such a 
feather-weight any distance. It must be art. But no one ex- 
plains what the art of it is; nor how it gets around that law 
of nature which says you shall not throw any two-ounce thing 
220 yards, either through the air or bumping along the ground. 
Eev. J. G. Woods says : 

"The distance to which the weet-weet or kangaroo-rat can be thrown is 
truly astonishing. I have seen an Australian stand at one side of Kennington 
Oval and throw the kangaroo rut completely across it." (Width of Kenning- 
ton Oval not stated.) " It darts through the air with the sharp and menac- 
ing hiss of a rifle-ball, its greatest height from the ground being some seven 

or eight feet When properly thrown it looks just like a living 

animal leaping along Its movements have a wonderful 

resemblance to the long leaps of a kangaroo-rat fleeing in alarm, with its long 
tail trailing behind it." 

The Old Settler said that he had seen distances made by the 
weet-weet, in the early days, which almost convinced him that 
it was as extraordinary an instrument as the boomerang. 

There must have been a large distribution of acuteness 
among those naked skinny aboriginals, or they couldn't have 
been such unapproachable trackers and boomerangers and 
weet-weeters. It mast have been race-aversion that put upon 
them a good deal of the low-rate intellectual reputation which 
they bear and have borne this long time in the world's estimate 
of them. 

They were lazy — alwaJT's lazy. Perhaps that was their 
trouble. It is a killing defect. Surely they could have in- 
vented and built a competent house, but they didn't. And 
they could have invented and developed the agricultural arts, 
but they didn't. They went naked and houseless, and lived 
on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits, and were just 
plain savages, for all their smartness. 

With a country as big as the United States to live and 
multiply in, and with no epidemic diseases among them till the 
white man came with those and his other appliances of 
civilization, it is quite probable that there was never a day in 
his history when he could muster 100,000 of his race in all 
Australia. He diligently and deliberately kept popu- 
lation down by infanticide — largely; but mainly by 

certain other methods. He 
did not need to practise 
these artificialities any more 
after the white man came. 
The white man knew ways 
of keeping down population 
which were worth 
several of his. The 
white man knew ways 
of reducing a native 
population 80 per 
cent, in 20 years. The 
native had never seen anything as fine as that before. 

For example, there is the case of the country now called 
Victoria — a country eighty times as large as Rhode Island, as 
I have already said. By the best official guess there were 
4,500 aboriginals in it when the whites came along in the 
middle of the ' Thirties. Of these, 1,000 lived in Gippsland, 
a patch of territory the size of fifteen or sixteen Rhode Islands : 
they did not diminish as fast as some of the other communities; 
indeed, at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them 
left. The Geelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily : from 
173 persons it faded to 34 in twenty years ; at the end of 
another twenty the tribe numbered one person altogether. 
The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300 when the 
white man came ; they could muster but twenty, thirty-seven 
years later, in 1875. In that year there were still odds and 
ends of tribes scattered about the colony of "Victoria, but I 
was told that natives of full blood are very scarce now. It is 
said that the aboriginals continue in some force in the huge 
territory called Queensland. 

The early whites were not used to savages. They could 
not understand the primary law of savage life : that if a man 
do you a wrong, his whole tribe is responsible — each individual 
of it — and you may take your change out of any individual 
of it, without bothering to seek out the guilty one. When a 
white killed an aboriginal, the tribe applied the ancient law, 
and killed the first white they came across. To the whites 
this was a monstrous thing. Extermination seemed to be the 
proper medicine for such creatures as this. They did not kill 
all the blacks, but they promptly killed enough of them to 
make their own persons safe. From the dawn of civilization 
down to this day the white man has always used that very 
precaution. Mrs. Campbell Praed lived in Queensland, as a 
child, in the early days, and in her " Sketches of Australian 
life," we get informing pictures of the early struggles of the 
white and the black to reform each other. 

Speaking of pioneer days in the mighty wilderness of 
Queensland, Mrs. Praed says : 

"At first the natives retreated before the whites; and, except that they 
every now and then speared a beast in one of the herds, gave little cause for 
uneasiness. But, as the number of squatters increased, each one taking up 
miles of country and bringing two or three men in his train, so that shepherds' 
huts and stockmen's camps lay far apart, and defenseless in the midst of 
hostile tribes, the Blacks' depredations became more frequent and murder 
was no unusual event. 

"Tlie loneliness of the Australian bush can hardly be painted in words. 
Here extends mile after mile of primeval forest where perhaps foot of white 
man has never trod — interminable vistas where the eucalyptus trees rear their 
lofty trunks and spread forth their lanky limbs, from which the red gum 
oozes and hangs in fantastic pendants like crimson stalactites ; ravines along 
the sides of which the long-bladed grass grows rankly ; level untimbered 
plains alternating with undulating tracts of pasture, here and there broken 
by a stony ridge, steep gully, or dried-up creek. All wild, vast and desolate ; 
all the same monotonous gray coloring, except where the wattle, when in 

blossom, shows patches of feathery gold, or a belt of scrub lies green, glossy, 
and impenetrable as Indian jungle. 

"The solitude seems intensified by the strange sounds of reptiles, birds, 
and insects, and by the absence of larger creatures ; of which in the day- 
time, the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd of kangaroo, or the 
rustle of a wallabi, or a dingo stirring the grass as it creeps to its lair. But 
there are the whirring of locusts, the demoniac chuckle of the laughing jack- 
ass, the screeching of cockatoos and parrots, the hissing of the frilled lizard, 
and the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the dense undergrowth. 
And then at night, the melancholy wailing of the curlews, the dismal howling 
of dingoes, the discordant croaking of tree-frogs, might well shake the 
nerves of the solitary watcher." 

That is the theater for the drama. When you comprehend 
one or two other details, you will perceive how well suited for 
trouble it was, and how loudly it invited it. The cattlemen's 
stations were scattered over that profound wilderness miles 
and miles apart — at each station half a dozen persons. There 
was a plenty of cattle, the black natives were always ill- 
nourished and hungry. The land belonged to them. The 
whites had not bought it, and couldn't buy it ; for the tribes 
had no chiefs, nobody in authority, nobody competent to sell 
and convey ; and the tribes themselves had no comprehension 
of the idea of transferable ownership of land. The ousted 
owners were despised by the white interlopers, and this opinion 
was not hidden under a bushel. More promising materials for 
a tragedy could not have been collated. Let Mrs. Praed speak : 

"At Nie Nie station, one dark night, the unsuspecting hut-keeper, having, 
as he believed, secured himself against assault, was lying wrapped in his 
blankets sleeping profoundly. The Blacks crept stealthily down the chimney 
and battered in his skull while he slept."
