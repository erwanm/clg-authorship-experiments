PATIENT (rousing). No more than his patients had in him.
DR. CARVER. Irritable! Very irritable! A significant symptom, Dr.
Gazell. In my opinion, this extreme irritability demands an operation
for appendicitis.
FIRST NURSE (listening, laughs; addresses SECOND NURSE). Now, if one
could only apply that! Take a cross man,--any cross man,--say a brother,
or a husband, or even a doctor, and if he carried it too far, just call
on Dr. Carver. Why, it would revolutionize society. And he is so expert!
He doesn’t mind it any more than carving a goo--oose. Yes, sir! I’m
coming. (Demurely obedient; hurries to DR. GAZELL.)
(SECOND NURSE moves to the rear of the ward to a patient behind a
screen.)
(DR. THORNE advances slowly; stands in the middle of the ward,
unnoticed.)
PATIENT NO. 21 (louder). I say, when a man’s dead is the time to speak
for him. And I’ll stand up for my dear dead doctor as long as I live.
VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. And so would I,--and longer, if I got the
chance.
ANOTHER VOICE. He doesn’t need anybody to stand up for him. His deeds do
follow him. And he rests from his labors.
(DR. THORNE smiles bitterly; stands with his face towards the speaker.
He knots his hands in front of him, and thus advances with a motion so
slow as to be almost stealthy.)
VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. He wouldn’t care so much for that. It’s Bible.
He was not a religious man. But he was as kind to me! (Weeps.)
OTHER VOICES. And to me! Oh, yes, and to me,--as kind!
PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR. I couldn’t move in my bed when I came
here. I’d been so three years. Look what he’s done for me. (Sobs.)
DR. THORNE (in a low tone). Miss Jessie? Don’t cry so. You’ll make
yourself worse. Go back to bed, Jessie, and--see. I’ll tell you a
secret. Don’t tell the others just yet. I wasn’t killed, Jessie. That
was a newspaper canard. I’m a live man yet. See! Look up, Jessie. Look
at me,--can’t you? (Pleads.) Won’t you, Jessie?
PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR (stares past him at DR. GAZELL and DR.
CARVER). And to think of the likes of them,--in his place! What ever’ll
become of this hospital without him?
DR. THORNE (with trembling lip). You don’t hear me, do you, Jessie?
Well--well. I must have met with some cerebral shock affecting the
organs of speech. It is a clear case of aphasia. I can’t make myself
understood. It--it’s hard. Jessie? (Louder.) I can’t see things go
wrong with you,--no matter how it is with me. You’ve been in that
chair long enough for to-day. (Imperiously.) Jessie, go back to bed!
Stop crying about me, and go back to your bed.
(JESSIE wavers; shades her eyes with her hands; stares about her;
slowly turns her wheeled chair and moves away.)
       [Exit JESSIE.
DR. THORNE (moves more naturally and rapidly; stands by the cot of No.
21; speaks). Good-morning, Mrs. True. I meant to have seen you last
night. I was--unavoidably detained. I hope you’re not worse this
morning?
PATIENT (with tears). I’ve cried half the night.
DR. THORNE. That’s a pity. But you won’t cry any more. I’ll take care of
you now.
PATIENT (looks up wearily; turns her face on her pillow and sobs).
DR. THORNE. Clearly aphasia. She does not understand a word I say. Dr.
Gazell! Gazell! Dr. Carver?
(The two physicians murmur together.)
DR. THORNE. Gazell? What’s that? The knife? For Mrs. True? Excuse me,
but I cannot permit it.
DR. CARVER. It would be such a pretty little operation. The students are
getting restless for something. I told them--
DR. GAZELL. It is well-defined appendicitis.
DR. THORNE. Well-defined appendi--fiddlesticks! It is nothing but
pleurisy. I tell you, Gazell, I will not have it!
DR. GAZELL (looks around uncomfortably; speaks with hesitation). Of
course, Thorne would not have agreed with us.
DR. THORNE (grips DR. GAZELL by the arm). I tell you it would be
butchery, Gazell! What are you thinking of? Gazell!
DR. GAZELL. But he was a very opinionated man,--everybody knew that.
(DR. THORNE drops DR. GAZELL’S arm and walks away with a gesture of
distress.)
SECOND NURSE (to FIRST NURSE; moves out from behind the screen).
Very invigorating day!
FIRST NURSE (to SECOND NURSE). Father Sullivan’s late with the
Sacrament. I hope Norah, yonder, won’t get ahead of him. She’s ’most
gone. (Approaching the cot of the patient behind the screen.)
SECOND NURSE (moves away). Yes. She’s been unconscious half an hour.
Enter PRIEST. (He advances to offer Extreme Unction to the dying
patient.)
FIRST NURSE. Lovely morning, Father.
DR. THORNE (standing in the middle of the ward). They used to call my
name when I came in. “Oh, there’s the doctor!” “The doctor’s come!” It
ran from cot to cot--like light. And everybody used to smile. Seems to
me some of them blessed me. Now--
(Sobs from the ward.)
DR. THORNE (tremulously). My patients! Isn’t there one of you who
knows me? Doesn’t anybody hear me? Don’t cry so! All the symptoms
will be worse for it.
THE DYING PATIENT. Doctor? Doctor?
DR. THORNE. That sounds like Norah.
PRIEST (recites behind the screen at NORAH’S bedside the prayer for
the passing soul). “Proficiscere, anima Christiana, de hoc mundo, in
nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, qui te creavit; in nomine Jesu Christi
Filii Dei vivi, qui pro te passus est; in nomine Spiritus Sancti”--
DR. THORNE (softly). Thank you, Father. (Stands silently with bowed
head.)
Reënter the patient in the wheeled chair.
JESSIE (happily). I’ve had such a lovely dream! I thought Dr. Thorne
was here--in this ward. Oh! (With disappointment.)
DR. THORNE. Jessie!
JESSIE (sadly). It was such a lovely dream! (Droops and turns away.)
(DR. THORNE walks apart; stands drearily, with downcast eyes.)
Enter MRS. FAYTH. (She looks pale and
agitated, but quite happy. She is
dressed as before, for the street, but
her head is bare; is wrapped from
head to foot in her long, pale, dove-colored
opera cape. She goes straight
to DR. THORNE, and touches him upon
the arm; speaks softly.)
MRS. FAYTH. Doctor?
DR. THORNE (starts). Oh! Mary Fayth! You? (He grasps her hand with
pathetic eagerness.) Oh, I never was so glad! You are the first
person--the only one--nobody else seemed to know me. I might have known
you would. Where’s Helen? Isn’t she with you? And you weren’t hurt at
all, were you? I have been--anxious about you. Those cowardly papers
said--I tried to get right over and see you. And, after all, you’re not
hurt. I thank-- (Looks around confusedly.) Ah, what shall I thank?
PRIEST. Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.
(DR. THORNE listens with troubled interest, like a child learning a
hard lesson.)
MRS. FAYTH (smiling). I can only stay a minute. I must get back to my
poor Fred.
DR. THORNE. Don’t leave me.
MRS. FAYTH. Oh, poor doctor! Don’t you see? The carriage overturned. I
was badly hurt. I only died an hour ago.
DR. THORNE (gasps, and stares at MRS. FAYTH. He tries to speak, but
can only articulate). You died an hour ago? And I? And I?
MRS. FAYTH (still smiling, with her sweet, mysterious smile). Don’t
take it so hard, doctor. I came to ex-plain it to you. Why, it’s the
most beautiful thing in the world! (Glides away slowly, but smiling to
the last.)
DR. THORNE (throws up his arms in anguish). I am dead! My God! I am a
dead man!
(His face falls into his hands, his whole body collapses slowly, he
drops.)
END OF SCENE I.
SCENE II.
It is night on a street in the West End of the city.
At the right stands a church, dimly lighted for a choir
to practice. An anthem on the organ can be heard.
At the left appears Dr. Thorne’s house, viewed from
the outside. It has high stone steps, and lights are
in the window. One window on the ground floor has
the curtain raised. The interior of the library can be
seen through the window,--glimpses of the books, the
pictures, the table, the lamp with the white lace shade.
The room is empty. Into it--
Enter MRS. THORNE. (She is dressed in
deep black. Her face is drawn with
grief. Her hands are clasped in front
of her. She paces the room drearily.
She is alone. She seats herself by the
table; tries to read; lays the book
down, and rises; paces the room.)
       [Exit MRS. THORNE.
Enter DR. THORNE at the far end of the
street near the church. (He is dressed
as before. He is still pale. His manner
has increased in agitation, but a
new resolution gives more firmness to
his wasted countenance. He speaks,
meditatively.)
DR. THORNE. After all, there is another life. I really did not think
it. (Stops and passes his hand over his eyes; muses.) God knows--if
there is a God--how it is with me. If I have never done anything, or
been anything, or felt anything that was fit to last, I have loved one
woman, and her only--and thought high thoughts for her, and felt great
emotions for her, and I could forget myself for her sake--and I would
have had joy to suffer for her, and I’ve been a better man for love of
her. And I have loved her,--oh, I have so loved her that ten thousand
deaths could not murder that living love! (Falters.) And I spoke to
her--I said to her--like any low and brutal fellow, any common
wife-tormentor--I went from her dear presence to this. (Brokenly.)
... And here there is neither speech nor language. Neither earth nor
heaven, nor my love ... nor my shame ... can give my famished eyes the
sight of her dear face,--nor my sealed lips the power to say, Forgive!
(The organ can be heard from the church.)
DR. THORNE (without noticing the anthem). I will not bear it. No--no.
I will not! I will go to her! (Starts to rush up the street, whose
familiar precincts he seems for the first time to recognize.) Why,
there is my own house! She can’t be two rods away. I wonder if a dead
man can get into his own home? Helen? (His feet lag heavily; he moves
like one who is wading in water. He makes the motions of one who
withstands a strong blast or an invisible force. He is beaten back.
Suddenly he raves.) You are playing with me! You torture a miserable
man. Who and what are you? Show me what I have to fight, and let me
wrestle for my liberty! Though I am a ghost, let me wrestle like a man!
Let me to my wife! Give way and let me seek her! (Slowly recedes, as if
beaten back; bows his head. The man sobs.)
CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH (chant).
    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     And they that worship Him”--
(Choir breaks off. The organ sounds on.)
(DR. THORNE seems to listen, but with a kind of anger. He slowly
recedes, as if pushed back.)
       [Exit DR. THORNE.
Enter the Veiled Woman. (She stands
mutely and wretchedly. Watches the
