lumps. When mixed, beat together to a cream. Season and stir in the
fish (which should be “picked” very fine) with a silver fork, heaping
it as you stir, instead of beating the mixture down. Do this quickly
and lightly, fill the shells, set in the oven to heat through, and when
smoking-hot draw to the oven door, and cover with the paste of egg and
butter. A little cream may be added to this paste if it be not soft
enough to spread easily. Shut the oven-door for two minutes, to heat
the paste.

Serve the dish very hot, and send around sliced lemon with it, as some
persons like to squeeze a few drops over the paté before eating.

Canned lobster and salmon are very good, thus prepared. Smoked salmon
can be made palatable for this purpose by soaking over night, and
boiling in two waters.


SWISS PATÉS.

Some slices of stale bread.

A little good dripping or very sweet lard mixed with the same quantity
of butter.

Two or three eggs beaten light.

Very fine cracker-crumbs.

Minced fowl or veal mixed with white sauce, and well seasoned. Cut
thick slices of stale bread—baker’s bread is best—into rounds with
a cake-cutter. With a smaller cutter extract a piece from the middle
of each round, taking care not to let the sharp tin go quite through
the bread, but leaving enough in the cavity to serve as a bottom to
the paté. Dip the hollowed piece of bread in the beaten egg, sift
the pulverized cracker over it, and fry in the dripping, or lard and
butter, to a delicate brown. Drain every drop of fat from it. Arrange
upon a hot dish when all are done, heap up with the “mince,” and eat
without delay.

Devilled crab or lobster is nice served in this style.

Bread patés are a convenience when the housekeeper has not time to
spare for pastry-making. You can, if you like, fry them without the egg
or cracker; but most persons would esteem them too rich.


STELLA PATÉ.

3 cups minced veal or lamb—either roast or boiled. If underdone, it is
an advantage, and if lamb be used, every particle of fat must be left
out.

1 can French mushrooms, or a pint of fresh ones.

4 hard-boiled eggs cut into slices, and a sliced onion.

4 table-spoonfuls melted butter, or a cupful strong veal, lamb or fowl
gravy.

3 cups fine bread-crumbs soaked in a cup of milk.

2 raw eggs beaten light and mixed with the milk.

Fry the mushrooms brown in dripping, or butter, with the onion, then
chop rather coarsely. Work the crumbs, milk and raw eggs into a thick,
smooth batter, with which line the bottom and sides of a well-greased
mould or baking dish. Within this put a layer of the minced meat,
seasoned to taste, wet with gravy or a little melted butter, and lay
sliced egg over it. Next should come a layer of mushrooms, then another
of meat, and so on, repeating the order given above until all your
materials are used up, or the mould is full. The upper layer should be
of the soaked crumbs. Cover closely and bake in a moderate oven half
an hour, or until the outer crust is well “set.” Then set the mould,
still covered, in a baking-pan half full of boiling water. Keep in
the oven, which should be hotter than at first, fifteen minutes longer.
Pass a thin sharp knife around the inside of the mould to loosen the
paté from the sides, and turn out with care upon a hot flat dish.
You should have a little brown gravy ready to pour over it.

If veal be the only meat used in preparing this dish, a layer of minced
ham will improve the flavor.

If these directions be strictly followed, the entrée will be pleasing
to both eye and palate.


PATÉ OF BEEF AND POTATO.

This is made according to the foregoing receipt, but substituting for
the bread-crumb crust one of mashed potato beaten soft and smooth
with a few spoonfuls of cream and raw egg. In place of mushrooms, put
a layer of chopped potatoes (previously boiled), mixed with a boiled
onion also chopped. Season with beef gravy, from which the fat has been
skimmed.


IMITATION PATÉ DE FOIE GRAS. +

Livers of four or five fowls and as many gizzards.

3 table-spoonfuls melted butter.

A chopped onion.

1 table-spoonful Worcestershire, or other pungent sauce.

Salt and white pepper to taste.

A few truffles, if you can get them.

Boil the livers until quite done, drain and wipe dry, and when cold,
rub them to a paste in a Wedgewood mortar. Let the butter and chopped
onion simmer together very slowly at the side of the range for ten
minutes. Strain them through thin muslin, pressing the bag hard to
extract the full flavor of the onion, and work this well into the
pounded liver. Turn into a larger vessel, and mix with it the rest of
the seasoning, working all together for a long while. Butter a small
china or earthen-ware jar or cup, and press the mixture hard down
within it, interspersing it with square bits of the boiled gizzards to
represent truffles. Of course, the latter are preferable, but being
scarce and expensive, they are not always to be had. If you have them,
boil them and let them get cold before putting them into the paté.
Cover all with melted butter and set in a cool, dry place. If well
seasoned it will keep for a fortnight in winter, but should be kept
closely covered.

This paté is a delicious relish, and is more easily attainable than
would at first appear. The livers of a turkey and a pair of chickens
or ducks will make a small one, and these can be saved from one
poultry-day to another by boiling them in salt water, and keeping in a
cool place. Or, one can often secure any number of giblets by previous
application at the kitchen of a restaurant or hotel.

Or,—

A fair imitation of the foregoing dish can be made from the liver of a
young calf, with bits of the tongue for mock truffles.




CROQUETTES.


THESE popular little roulettes, although comparatively new to the
tables of most private families in America, hold their place well where
they have been once introduced. Like the paté, their name is Legion
as regards shape, nature and quality.

In a housewifely conversation with a lady a few months since, the word
“croquette” chanced to escape me, and I was caught up eagerly.

“Now,” with an ingenuous blush, “do you know, I was offered some at a
dinner-party the other day, and was completely nonplussed! I thought
croquet was a game.”

“Croquette!” I interposed, making the most of the final t, and e.

“The gentleman who sat next me said ‘croquay,’ very plainly, I assure
you. But never mind the name. What are they made of? Hominy?”

“Yes,” returned I. “Or rice, or potato, or lobster, crab, salmon,
halibut, cod, chicken, turkey, duck, game, veal, lamb, or beef. In
short, of all kinds of fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetable. The smaller
varieties are familiarly known to readers of cookery-books as ‘olives’
of meat, poultry, or game; the larger as rissoles or croquettes,
the largest as cannelons or mirotons.”

“Good gracious!” uttered my overwhelmed friend. “Before I would bother
my brain with such puzzling nonsense, I would set my family down to
cold meat three times a day three days in a week!”

I believed she meant what she said. But not the less is it a “good”
and a “gracious” thing for the housewife to conjure out of such
unconsidered and unsightly trifles as the mutilated cold fowl from
which half the breast and both legs are missing, or the few chops
“left over,” or “that bone” of lamb or veal, or three square inches of
cold fish, a pretty plat for breakfast or luncheon, of golden-brown
croquettes, imbedded in parsley, or in a ruby setting of pickled beets,
that shall quicken John’s flagging appetite, and call from the little
ones the never stale plaudit, “Mamma can always get up something nice.”

“Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost,” is a text
from which the thoughtful house-mother may preach to herself, as well
as to her servants. That no opportunity of making home fairer, and even
one hour of the day a little brighter, be lost or overlooked. That no
possibility of proving her constant, active love for the least of her
flock be passed by. These daily cares and hourly assiduities are the
rivets in the chain that binds her best beloved ones unto THE FAMILY.
Lacking them, the relation, instituted by law and continued by custom,
has no stancher securities than habit and convenience—a hay-rope that
will shrivel at the first touch of Passion, be rent by one resolute
wrench of Expediency.

“A serious view to take of croquettes?” do I hear you say. Then hearken
to something positive and practical.

Unpalatable food is not wholesome. It may be medicinal. Nothing
forced upon an unwilling appetite, and that does not gratify the
palate, can impart that freshness of animal spirit and vigor which we
