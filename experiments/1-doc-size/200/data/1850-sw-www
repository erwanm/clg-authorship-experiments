CHAPTER XXVII. 




Before Ellen's eyes were open the next morning — almost 
before she awoke — the thought of the Christmas visit, the 
sleigh-ride, John Humphreys, and the weather, all rushed 
into her mind at once ; and started her half up in the bed to 
look out of the window. Well frosted the panes of glass were, 
but at the corners and edges unmistakeable bright gleams of 
light came in. 

" Alice, it's beautiful !" exclaimed Ellen ; " look how 
the sun is shining ! and 'tisn't very cold. Are we going to- 
day?" 

" I don't know yet Ellie, but we shall know very soon. 
We'll settle that at breakfast." 

At breakfast it was settled. They were to go, and set off 
directly. Mr. Humphreys could not go with them, because 
he had promised to bury little John Dolan ; the priest had declared he would have nothing to do with it ; and the poor 
mother had applied to Mr. Humphreys, as being the clergyman 
her child had most trusted and loved to hear. It seemed 
that little John had persuaded her out of half her prejudices 
by his affectionate talk and blameless behavior during some 
time past. Mr. Humphreys therefore must stay at home that 
day. He promised however to follow them the next, and 
would by no means permit them to wait for him. He said 
the day was fine and they must improve it ; and he should 
be pleased to have them with their friends as long as possible. 







So the little travelling bag was stuffed, with more things 
than it seemed possible to get into it. Among the rest Ellen 
brought her little red Bible, which Alice decided should go in 
John's pocket ; — the little carpet-bag could not take it. 
Ellen was afraid it never would be locked. By dint of much 
pushing and crowding however, locked it was ; and they 
made themselves ready. Over Ellen's merino dress and 
coat went an old fur tippet ; a little shawl was tied round her 
neck ; her feet were cased in a pair of warm moccasins, which 
belonging to Margery were of course a world too big for her, 
but " anything but cold," as their owner said. Her nice blue 
hood w r ould protect her head well, and Alice gave her a green 
veil to save her eyes from the glare of the snow. When 
Ellen shuffled out of Alice's room in this trim, John gave her 
one of his grave looks, and saying she looked like Mother 
Bunch, begged to know how she expected to get to the sleigh ; 
he said she w r ould want a footman indeed to wait upon her, 
to pick up her slippers, if she went in that fashion. However 
he ended by picking her up, carried her and set her down 
safely in the sleigh. Alice followed, and in another minute 
they were off. 

Ellen's delight was unbounded. Presently they turned 
round a corner and left the house behind out of sight ; and 
they were speeding away along a road that was quite new to 
her. Ellen's heart felt like dancing for joy. Nobody would 
have thought it, she sat so still and quiet between Alice and 
her brother ; but her eyes were very bright as they looked 
joyously about her, and every now and then she could not 
help smiling to herself. Nothing was wanting to the pleasure 
of that ride. The day was of winter's fairest ; the blue sky 
as clear as if clouds had never dimmed or crossed it. None 
crossed it now. It was cold, but not bitterly cold, nor 
windy ; the sleigh skimmed along over the smooth frozen surface of the snow as if it was no trouble at all to Prince 
Charlie to draw it ; and the sleigh-bells jingled and rang, the 
very music for Ellen's thoughts to dance to. And then with 
somebody she liked very much on each side of her, and pleasures untold in the prospect, no wonder she felt as if her 
heart could not hold any more. The green veil could not be 
kept on, everything looked so beautiful in that morning's sun. 
The long wide slopes of untrodden and unspotted snow, too 







bright sometimes for the eye to look at ; the shadows that 
here and there lay upon it, of woodland and scattered trees ; 
the very brown fences, and the bare arms and branches of 
the leafless trees showing sharp against the white ground and 
clear bright heaven ; — all seemed lovely in her eyes. For 

M It is content of heart 
Gives nature power to please." 

She could see nothing that was not pleasant. And besides 
they were in a nice little red sleigh, with a warm buffalo 
robe, and Prince Charlie was a fine spirited grey that scarcely 
ever needed to be touched with the whip ; at a word of encouragement from his driver he would toss his head and set 
forward with new life, making all the bells jingle again. To 
be sure she would have been just as happy if they had had 
the poorest of vehicles on runners, with old John instead ; but 
still it was pleasanter so. 

Their road at first was through a fine undulating country 
like that between the Nose and Thirlwall ; farmhouses and 
patches of woodland scattered here and there. It would seem 
that the minds of all the party were full of the same thoughts, 
for after a very long silence Alice's first word, almost sigh, was, 

" This is a beautiful world, John !" 

" Beautiful ! — wherever you can escape from the signs of 
man's presence and influence." 

" Isn't that almost too strong ?" said Alice. 

He shook his head, smiling somewhat sadly, and touched 
Prince Charlie, who was indulging himself in a walk. 

" But there are bright exceptions," said Alice. 

" I believe it ; — never so much as when I come home." 

" Are there none around you then in whom you can have 
confidence and sympathy ?" 

He shook his head again. " Not enough, Alice. I long  
for you every day of my life." 

Alice turned her head quick away. 

" It must be so, my dear sister," he said presently ; " we 
can never expect to find it otherwise. There are, as you say, 
bright exceptions, — many of them ; but in almost all I find 
some sad want. We must wait till we join the spirits of the 
just made perfect, before we see society that will be all we 
wish for." 







" What is Ellen thinking of all this while ?" said Alice 
presently, bending down to see her face. " As grave as a 
judge ! — what are you musing about V* 

" I was thinking," said Ellen, " how men could help the 
world's being beautiful." 

" Don't trouble your little head with that question," said 
John smiling ; — " long may it be before you are able to answer 
it. Look at those snow-birds !" 

By degrees the day wore on. About one o'clock they 
stopped at a farm-house to let the horse rest, and to stretch 
their own limbs, which Ellen for her part was very glad to 
do. The people of the house received them with great hospitality and offered them pumpkin pies and sweet cider. 
Alice had brought a basket of sandwiches, and Prince Charlie 
was furnished with a bag of corn Thomas had stowed away 
in the sleigh for him ; so they were all well refreshed and 
rested and warmed before they set off again. 

From home to Ventnor, Mr. Marshman's place, was more 
than thirty miles, and the longest, because the most difficult, 
P'-irt of the way was still before them. Ellen, however, soon 
became sleepy, from riding in the keen air ; she was content 
now to have the green veil over her face, and sitting down in 
the bottom of the sleigh, her head leaning against Alice, and 
covered well with the buffalo robe, she slept in happy unconsciousness of hill and dale, wind and sun, and all the remaining hours of the way. 

It was drawing towards four o'clock when Alice with some 
difficulty roused her to see the approach to the house and 
get wide awake before they should reach it. They turned 
from the road and entered by a gateway into some pleasure- 
grounds, through which a short drive brought them to the 
house. These grounds were fine, but the wide lawns were a 
smooth spread of snow now ; the great skeletons of oaks and 
elms were bare and wintry ; and patches of shrubbery offered 
little but tufts and bunches of brown twigs and stems. It 
might have looked dreary, but that some well-grown ever- 
greens were clustered round the house, and others scattered 
here and there relieved the eye ; — a few holly bushes, singly 
and in groups, proudly displayed their bright dark leaves 
and red berries ; — and one unrivalled hemlock on the west 
threw its graceful shadow quite across the lawn, on which, 







as on itself, the white chimney tops, and the naked branches 
of oaks and elms, was the faint smile of the afternoon sun.
