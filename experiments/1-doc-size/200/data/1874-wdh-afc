The moon was shining brightly into the garden. 



XV. 

FLORIDA and Don Ippolito had paused in the 
pathway which parted at the fountain and led in 
one direction to the water-gate, and in the other out 
through the palace-court into the campo. 

" Now, you must not give way to despair again," 
she said to him. " You will succeed, I am sure, 
for you will deserve success." 

" It is all your goodness, madamigella," sighed 
the priest, " and at the bottom of my heart I am 
afraid that all the hope and courage I have are also 
yours." 

" You shall never want for hope and courage 
then. We believe in you, and we honor your pur 
pose, and we will be your steadfast friends. But 
now you must think only of the present of how 
you are to get away from Venice. Oh, I can un 
derstand how you must hate to leave it ! What a 
beautiful night ! You must n t expect such moon 
light as this in America, Don Ippolito." 

"It is beautiful, is it not?" said the priest, 
kindling from her. " But I think we Venetians are 
never so conscious of the beauty of Venice as you 



strangers are. 



" I don 't know. I only know that now, since we 
have made up our minds to go, and fix?d the day and 



 

hour, it is more like leaving my own country than 
anything else I Ve ever felt. This garden, I seem 
to have spent my whole life in it ; and when we 
are settled in Providence, I'm going to have mother 
send back for some of these statnes. I suppose 
Signer Cavaletti would n t mind our robbing his 
place of them if he were paid enough. At any rate 
we must have this one that belongs to the fountain. 
You shall be the first to set the fountain playing 
over there, Don Ippolito, and then we'll sit down 
on this stone bench before it, and imagine ourselves 
in the garden of Casa Vervain at Venice." 

" No, no : let me be the last to set it playing 



here," said the priest, quickly stooping to the pipe 
at the foot of the figure, " and then we will sit 
down here, and imagine ourselves in the garden of 
Casa Vervain at Providence." 

Florida put her hand on his shoulder. " You 
must n t do it," she said simply. " The padrone 
doesn 't like to waste the water." 

"Oh, we'll pray the saints to rain it back on him 
some day," cried Don Ippolito with willful levity, 
and the stream leaped into the moonlight and 
seemed to hang there like a tangled skein of silver. 

" But how shall I shut it off when you are 
gone ? " asked the young girl, looking ruefully at 
the floating threads of splendor. 

" Oh, I will shut it off before I go," answered 
Don Ippolito. " Let it play a moment," he con 
tinued, gazing rapturously upon it. while the moon 



 

painted his lifted face with a pallor that his black 
robes heightened. He fetched a long, sighing 
breath, as if he inhaled with that respiration all 
the rich odors of the flowers, blanched like his own 
visage in the white lustre ; as if he absorbed into 
his heart at once the wide glory of the summer 
night, and the beauty of the young girl at his side. 
It seemed a supreme moment with him ; he looked 
as a man might look who has climbed out of life 
long defeat into a single instant of release and tri 
umph. 

Florida sank upon the bench before the fountain, 
indulging his caprice with that sacred, motherly 
tolerance, some touch of which is in all womanly 
yielding to men's will, and which was perhaps 
present in greater degree in her feeling towards a 
man more than ordinarily orphaned and unfriended. 

" Is Providence your native city ? " asked Don 
Ippolito, abruptly, after a little silence. 

" Oli no ; I was born at St. Augustine in Flor 
ida." 

" Ah yes, I forgot ; madama has told me about 
it; Providence is her city. But the two are near 
together ? " 

" No," said Florida, compassionately, " they are 
a thousand miles apart." 

" A thousand miles ? What a vast country ! " 

" Yes, it's a whole world." 

" Ah, a world, indeed ! " cried the priest, softly. 
" I shall never comprehend it." 


 

" You never will," answered tlie young girl 
gravely, " if you do not think about it more practi 
cally." 

" Practically, practically ! " lightly retorted the 
priest. u What a word with you Americans ! 
That is the consul's word : practical." 

"Then you have been to see him to-day ? " 
asked Florida, witli eagerness. " I wanted to ask 
you"- 

kt Yes. I went to consult the oracle, as you bade 
me." 

" Don Ippolito " 

" And he was averse to my going to America. 
He said it was not practical." 

" Oh ! " murmured the girl. 

" I think," continued the priest with vehemence, 
"that Signor Ferris is no longer my friend.* 

" Did he treat you coldly harshly ? " she asked, 
with a note of indignation in her voice. " Did he 
know that I that you came " 

" Perhaps he was right. Perhaps I shall indeed 
go to ruin there. Ruin, ruin ! Do "I not live ruin 
here ? " 

" What did he say what did Ira tell you ? " 

"No, no; not now, madamigella ! I do not 
want to think of that man, now. I want you to 
help me once more to realize myself in America, 
where I shall never have been a priest, where I 
sluill at least battle even-handed with the world. 
Come, let us forget him ; the thought of him p.d- 



 

sies all my hop: . He could not see me save in this 
robe, in this figure that I abhor." 

" Oh, it was strange, it was not like him, it was 
cruel ! What did he's ay ? " 

" In everything but words, he bade me despair ; 
he bade me look upon all that makes life dear and 
noble as impossible to me ! " 

" Oh, how ? Perhaps he did not understand 
you. No, he did not understand you. What did 
you say to him, Don Ippolito ? Tell me ! " She 
leaned towards him, in anxious emotion, as she 
spoke. 

The priest rose, and stretched out his arms, as if 
he would gather something of courage from the in 
finite space. - In his visage were the sublimity and 
the terror of a man who puts everything to the risk. 

" How will it really be with me, yonder ? " he
