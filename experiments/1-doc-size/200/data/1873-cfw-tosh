and, accompanied by the captain, ran back 
through the cabin, arousing the passengers and 
telling them of the danger. In an instant all 



 

was confusion, agony, and despair ; some of the 
men leaped overboard, buc the women with their 
instinctive shrinking from the dark water, could 
not be persuaded to leave the deck. A few 
passengers and part of the crew got off in one 
of the small boats, but the other boats were 
swamped by the rush into them ; a cry went up 
that the steamer was sinking, and Hugh was 
seen to jump overboard with a little child in his 
arms, a baby whose mother had held it implor- 
ingly towards him, as he tried to persuade her to 
take the dangerous leap. " Take the child," 
she said ; " I will follow you," and then as they 
disappeared, with a wild cry the poor woman 
flunsf herself over after them. In the mean 
time the captain and some of the hands and pas- 
sengers had ascended to the hurricane deck, 
and when the America sank, the force of the 
waves separated the deck from the hull, and it 
floated off, a frail support for the little group it 
carried. The lake was strewn with fragments, 
spars and barrels, and to these many persons 
were clinging. Hugh had managed to secure a 

piece of broken mast with spars attached, and 

with its aid he supported the mother and child 

until an iron-bound cask, caught in the cordage, 

struck him heavily in the darkness. The mother 

heard him groan, and his grasp loosened. 

" Quick ! " he said hoarsely- ; " I cannot hold 

you. I must fasten you with these floating 

ropes ; I am badly hurt, but I think I can hold 

the child." 

He bound the ropes and rigging about her, 

and told her how she could best support herself ; 

then he was silent, but every now and then she 

heard him moaning as though in pain. How 

long they floated in this way the mother could 

not tell ; it seemed to her many hours, — it was, 

in reality, less than four. They saw the lights of 

the Empire in the distance, but they could not 

make themselves heard, although they shouted 

with all their strength. At the first glimmering 

of dawn they discovered the hurricane deck not 

far distant, and Hugh said, " shout with all your 
 

might. I cannot hold on much longer, my head 
is on fire ! " So the mother exerted all her 
strength in a piercing scream, and to her joy, an 
answering cry came back through the rain. 
Hugh made an effort to steer the spars towards 
the floating deck, and those on board pushed 
their raft towards him as well as they could. 
Still it was slow work, and as the dawn grew 
brighter, the mother saw her preserver's haggard 
face, and the blood matted in his curly hair. He 
did not speak, as, holding the baby in one arm, 
with the other he tried to guide the broken 
mast, but his eyes were strangely glazed and the 
shadow of death was on his brow. They 
reached the deck at last, and kind have lifted 
them on board ; it was only a raft, but it seemed 
a support after the deep, dark watc. The 
mother took her baby, and Hugh sank down at 
her feet. Some one had a flask of bra/\dy, and 
they succeeded in pouring a little tV.-ough his 
clenched teeth ; after a moment o? two he 
revived, sat up, looked about him, and murmured 




some incoherent words. Then he tiiecl to take 
out his little note-book, but it was wet, and 
the pencil was gone ; the captain gave him his 
own, and Hugh had scrawled a few words upon 
it, spoke to the mother and smiled when she 
held up the child. But gradually he relapsed 
into unconsciousness, grew more and more 
death-like, and, after breathing heavily for an 
hour, passed away without a struggle The 
mother and her child were safe ; all the others on 
the floating deck were rescued, — but Hugh, 
dear Hugh was dead ! 

Mr. Leslie had preceded the funeral cortege by 
a few moments ; slowly he alighted from the 
carriage and passed up the garden-walk towards 
the old stone house. His heart was heavy, and 
words of comfort came not to his lips ; in the 
presence of so great a sorrow he bowed his 
head in silence. The friends who were in the 
house, came out to meet him, but no one spoke ; 
they knew by his face that the worst was true. 
They did not follow him into the presence of 



 

the mourners, but going down to the gate, they 
waited there. 

' Mr. Leslie entered the sitting-room. " The 
Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away," he 
said solemnly. "Blessed be the name of the 
Lord. Hugh, our dear Hugh is dead." 

Sibyl screamed and fell back fainting, the 
children burst into tears, and Aunt Faith knelt 
down by her chair and hid her face in her hands. 
Bessie alone was calm. " Are they bringing 
him home ? " she asked, lifting her tearless eyes 
to Mr. Leslie's face. 

" Yes Bessie ; they will soon be here, now." 

Without reply she rose, smoothed her dis- 
ordered curls and arranged her dress. " Sibyl," 
she said, " do not cry ; Hugh never could bear 
to hear any one cry! Aunt Faith, Hugh is 
coming. Let us go to meet him." 

Her strange composure awed the violent 
grief of the others into silence, and they followed 
her mechanically as she led the way to the piazza; 
involuntarily they all took the positions of the 





previous evening, and, with Bessie standing 
alone in the centre, they waited for their dead. 

The young men bore their burden up the 
walk slowly and solemnly, and behind followed 
a train of sorrowing friends, two and two, thus 
rendering respect to the youth who had so 
suddenly been taken from them in all the flush 
and vigor of early manhood. On came the sad 
procession, and when the bearers reached the 
piazza, the friends fell back and stood with 
uncovered heads, as up the steps, and under the 
faded triumphal arch, Hugh Warrington came 
home for the last time to the old stone house. 

At midnight Aunt Faith went softly into the 
parlor ; a faint light shone from the chandelier 
upon the still figure beneath, and Bessie with 
her face hidden in her hands, sat by its side. 
She did not move as Aunt Faith came to her ; 
she did not answer when Aunt Faith spoke to 
her ; she seemed almost as cold and rigid as the 
dead. 

" Bessie dear, I have something to show you," 



 

said Aunt Faith, in a low tone ; " I have a letter 
to you from Hugh." 

Bessie started and looked up ; her face was 
pinched and colorless, and her dark eyes wild 
and despairing. 

" I have a letter to you, dear, from Hugh," 
repeated Aunt Faith; "he wrote it on board
