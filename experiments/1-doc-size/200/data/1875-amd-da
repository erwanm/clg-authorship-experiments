"It was not my fault, my poor darling, you know 
that. Your papa had such a terrible will ; and no one 
can say but that I obeyed, like a little child. Not that 
I mean to find any fault, and he cold in his grave — " 

" Never mind, mamma — it cannot be helped now. 
But for that letter, I should have married Ralph, and 
been a happy wife — yet I do not blame you." 

" You are such a dear, generous girl, Edith — my 
only comfort in this world of care. Poor Ralph ! Of 
course, he will get a divorce." 




"Mamma, you are tired and agitated, and must go 
to bed. We will talk it all over at our leisure — for, at 
present, it is such a surprise." 

She uttered this very gently, and her mother yielded, 
as she usually did. Edith Merrivour had learned to 
gain her point without any unladylike show of temper 
or displeasure. Her most intimate friends abroad 
pronounced her an angel; but it was indolence and 
apathy, rather than any high principle or sacrifice of 
self. 

Standing there in silence, she said over again — 
but for that letter I should have married Ralph Tre- 
maine. ,, She believed it firmly now, in the light of 
her years of experience, and the mean, barren, unsat- 
isfactory life she had led. And yet, if she could have 
gone back to that day and been Edith Lester and looked 
on Ralph Tremaine, struggling to gain for her sake the 
position and wealth he # had given up for his father's 
good name, poor and reduced to the strictest economies 
of life, and on the other hand on Archibald Merrivour 
worth a million, and ready to lay it at her feet, she 
would have made the same choice. For the petted and 
aristocratic Edith Lester had a horror of poverty. I 
doubt if even now she would have given up her fortune 
and become a poor man's wife, for love of Ralph Tre- 
maine. 

Events had fostered the regard. She and Ralph had 
been thrown much together through their early years, 



and loved almost unconsciously. During the latter 
part of Mr. Tremaine's life, he had become deeply im- 
mersed in speculations that proved most disastrous. 
Dying suddenly, Ralph found upon examination, that 
not only were there no assets, but that several sums 
his father had been entrusted with, were also swallowed 
up. x The fortune he had inherited from his mother, 
was applied to the instant liquidation of these debts, 
and Woodlea mortgaged to its utmost, for Ralph Tre- 
maine was prouder of a good name than of all the 
wealth of the world. When no man could say that he 
had been wronged a farthing, Ralph took his place in 
the ranks with- an undaunted front, and commenced 
the hard fight for the world's favor and prosperity. 
For awhile, it seemed as if circumstances were all against 
him. Mr. Lester was among the first to ridicule the 
j-oung man's Quixotism, as he called it, in so scrupu- 
lously fulfilling his father's engagements. It had also 
led to a coolness between himself and Edith, who fore- 
saw a wearisome engagement, or a marriage that did 
not look attractive to her j-outhful eyes, dazzled with 
continual glitter and homage. 

The Lesters had always lived in elegant style ; but 
those best informed on the subject, believed that the 
fair Edith's portion would be by no means extrava- 
gant. At this juncture, Mr. Merrivour laid his hand 
and fortune at her feet, won by her beauty and fasci- 
nations. 



A man worth a million, rumor said, and apparently 
well enough in all other respects. Not a bad-looking 
person, and holding his age remarkably, affable, lavish 
in his gifts and his attentions — and Edith was not a 
little elated with her triumph. Day by day, the temp- 
tation grew upon her ; and if anything more was needed, 
her father supplied it* Indeed, they had more than one 
stormy scene. A word to Ralph would have ended the 
persecution — but she was not quite sure that it was 
wisest to relinquish Mr. Merrivour. 

One evening, Ralph had an interview with Mr. Lester, 
Edith being at the opera. It must be confessed that 
he rather exceeded the bounds of truth in announcing 
his daughter's engagement in such positive terms, yet 
it had greeted Ralph's ears before this night. To make 
it still more certain, he instructed the servants if Mr. 
Tremaine called, to say that Miss Edith was out or 
engaged. Failing to see her, Ralph had recourse to a 
note which the weak, obedient wife placed in the hands 
of her lord and master. 

Edith Lester fancied that she yielded to circumstan- 
ces, when, had Mr. Merrivour been a man of ordinary 
means, no pressure would have induced her to take the 
step. She knew of the prohibition, and, before her 
wedding day her mother, foolishly confessed the ab- 
stracted letter. 

Ralph was away at this juncture. 

"It is too late now,". Edith said, heroically, and 




made the most elegant bride of the season in satin and 
point lace. When Ralph returned she was in Europe, 
whither her parents soon followed her, and the next 
announcement was Mr. Lester's death. 

I think Edith Merrivour might have forgotten this 
little episode, had her life been a tolerably pleasant one. 
Mr. Merrivour proved a jealous, tyrannical, unresona- 
ble husband. Edith went clothed in velvet and dia- 
monds, indeed her husband spared no expense, but one 
dollar unaccounted for, was sufficient to make him storm 
fearfully. He was proud of the admiration she excited, 
but the most simple word or look set him raving like a 
madman. At first, Edith met these demonstrations 
with fire and spirit. She even declared to her mother 
that she would not endure it, but return to her native . 
land alone, if need were. 

" My poor darling, what could we do!" exclaimed 
the mother in terror. " My income you know is barely 
sufficient for my simple wants — not but that you would 
be welcome to every dollar, if it could help you. And 
Mr. Merrivour might compel you to return. He has 
never done anything cruel, you know, and the law is all 
on a man's side." 

The argument was neither logical nor convincing, 
but a consciousness stronger than that swayed Edith. 
When it came to the truth, she was too proud to own 
herself beaten with a weapon of her own choosing. 
She steeled herself to these petty insults and tyrannies, 



grew regally indifferent, and in her heart dreamed over 
Ralph Tremaine's tenderness, fancying herself more of 
a martyr every day. His marriage was a heavy blow — 
she had taken great comfort in believing that he could 
never love another woman. Then came her husband's 
illness and death, and Edith Merrivour was free, while 
she still had youth and beauty. 

She was glad to give up foreign life, for so much 
of it had become hateful in her eyes. Mrs. Lester 
agreed to anything that her daughter proposed. She 
hardly knew herself when free from bondage, and 
would willingly have let her daughter play the tyrant, 
had she so desired. But Edith's experience had ren- 
dered her rather cold, self-contained, and with a lofty 
indifference, quoted by most people as the perfection of 
temper. 

This was Edith Merrivour's story. She had grown 
no grander or tenderer for her trials. Looking back at 
them she blamed fate, and her father, and believed 
sincerely that she would have been a true, noble and 
loving woman, if she had been free to follow her own 
desires. 

How she should meet Ralph Tremaine, or if at all, 
she had hardly thought. Fate had opened a door for 
her. Should she hesitate and let the opportunity pass. 

She drew a dainty little writing case towards her, 
opened to the black edged paper with its fanciful an- 
tique monogram. Then she found her pen as if under 
the influence of some spell, and began to write. 



" Dear Friend — If you could know atl, j r ou would 
believe that I have not forfeited every claim to friend- 
ship. Still, I had not thought to call myself to your 
remembrance, and might have lived for years at your 
very side without making any sign, but for a singular 
circumstance. I have just heard your story from a gen- 
tleman whom I met abroad, and who has been one of 
the unwitting actors in the sad tragedy. My mother's 
heart is almost broken about you. Does not the kinship 
of suffering lead us to forget what was painful in our 
past, and draw us together as friends in truth, as well 
as word ? It has emboldened me to send you this card
