We must marry at once! The doctor may put 
me on the boat and force you to remain behind  
otherwise ' 

''And you want me to find a minister?" she asked, 
with ready comprehension. 

"That's it!"— eagerly. "Bring him back with 
you. Some of the hotel guests can act as witnesses. 
Make haste!" 

Ruth hurried off to her own room. Before she 
put on her sun-helmet, she paused before the mirror. 
Her wedding gown! She wondered if the spirit of 
the unknown mother looked down upon her. 

"All I want is to be happy!" she said aloud, as if 
she were asking for something of such ordinary value 
that God would readily accord it to her because there 
was so little demand for the commodity. 

Thrilling, she began to dance, swirled, glided, and 
dipped. Whenever ecstasy — any kind of ecstasy — 
filled her heart to bursting, these physical expres- 
sions eased the pressure. 

Fate has two methods of procedure —  the sudden 
and the long-drawn-out. In some instances she 
tantalizes the victim for years and mocks him in the 
end. In others, she acts with the speed and surety of 
the loosed arrow. In the present instance she did not 
want any interference; she did not want the doctor's 
wisdom to edge in between these two young fools 
and spoil the drama. So she brought upon the stage 
the Reverend Henry Dolby, a preacher of means> 





worldly-wise and kindly, cheery and rotund, who, 
with his wife and daughter, had arrived at the Vic- 
toria that morning. Ruth met him in the hall as he 
was following his family into the dining room. She 
recognized the cloth at once, waylaid him, and with 
that directness of speech particularly hers she ex- 
plained what she wanted. 

" To be sure I will, my child. I will be up with my 
wife and daughter after lunch.'' 

"We'll be waiting for you. You are very kind." 
Ruth turned back toward the stairs. 

Later, when the Reverend Henry Dolby entered 
the Spurlock room, his wife and daughter trailing 
amusedly behind him, and beheld the strained eager- 
ness on the two young faces, he smiled inwardly and 
indulgently. Here were the passionate lovers! What 
their past had been he neither cared nor craved to 
know. Their future would be glorious; he saw it in 
their eyes; he saw it in the beauty of their young 
heads. Of course, at home there would have been 
questions. Were the parents agreeable? Were they 
of age? Had the license been procured? But here, 
in a far country, only the velvet manacles of wedlock 
were necessary. 

So, forthwith, without any preliminaries beyond 
introductions, he began the ceremony; and shortly 
Ruth Enschede became Ruth Spurlock, for better or 
for worse. Spurlock gave his full name and trem- 
blingly inscribed it upon the certificate of marriage. 



 

The customaiy gold band was missing; but a soft gold 
Chinese ring Spurloek had picked up in Singapore — 
the characters r resenting good luck and prosperity 
— was slipped over Ruth's third finger. 

'' There is no fee," said Dolby. " I am very happy 
to be of service to you. And I wish you all the hap- 
pmess in the world." 

Mrs. Dolby was portly and handsome. There 
were lines in her face that age had not put there. 
Guiding this man of hers over the troubled sea of life 
had engraved these lines. He was the true optimist; 
and that he should proceed, serenely unconscious of 
reefs and storms, she accepted the double buffets. 

This double buffetting had sharpened her shrewd- 
ness and insight. Where her husband saw only two 
youngsters in the mating mood, she felt that tragedy 
in some phase lurked in this room —  if only in the 
loneliness of these two, without kith or kin appar- 
ently, thousands of miles from home' Not once 
during the ceremony did the two look at each other, 
but riveted their gaze upon the lips of the man who 
was forging the bands: gazed intensively, as if they 
feared the world might vanish before the last word 
of the ceremony was spoken. 

Spurloek relaxed, suddenly, and sank deeply into 
his pillows. Ruth felt his hand grow cold as it 
slipped from hers. She bent down. 
"You are all right?" —  anxiously. 
VYes . . . but dreadfully tired." 





Mrs. Dolby smiled. It was the moment for smiles. 
She approached Ruth with open arms; and something 
in the way the child came into that kindly embrace 
hurt the older woman to the point of tears. 

These passers-by who touch us but lightly and are 
gone» leaving the eternal imprint! So long as she 
lived, Ruth would always remember that embrace. 
It was warm, shielding, comforting, and what was 
more, full of understanding. It was in fact the first 
embrace of motherhood she had ever known. Even 
after this woman had gone, it seemed to Ruth that 
the room was kindlier than it had ever been. 

Inexplicably there flashed into vision the Chinese 
wedding procession in the narrow, twisted streets 
of the city, that first day: the gorgeous palanquin, 
the tom-toms, the weird music, the ribald, jeering 
mob that trailed along behind. It was surely odd 
that her thought should pick up that picture and 
recast it so vividly. 

At half after five that afternoon the doctor and his 
friend McClintock entered the office of the Victoria. 

"It's a great world,'' was the manager's greeting. 

"So it is,'' the doctor agreed. "But what, may I 
ask, arouses the thought? " 

The doctor was in high good himiour. Within forty- 
eight hours the girl would be on her way east and 
the boy see-sawing the South China Sea, for ever 
moving at absolute angles. 



 

''Then you haven't heard?'' 
"'Of what?" 

''Well, well!" cried the manager, delighted at the 
idea of surprising the doctor. ''Miss Enschede and 
!Mj. Spurlock —  for that's his real name —  were 
married at high noon." 

 Emptiness; that was the doctor's initial sensation: 

liis vitals had been whisked out of him and the earth 

from under his feet. All his interest in Ruth, all his 

care and solicitude, could now be translated into a 

single word —  love. Wanted her out of the way 

because he had been afraid of her, afraid of himself! 

He, at fifty-four! Then into this void poiu  a 

flaming anger, a blind and unreasoning anger. He 

took the first step toward the stairs, and met the 

restraining hand of McClintock. 

"Steady, old top! What are you going to do?" 
"The danmed scoundrel!" 
"I told you that child was opal." 
"She? My God, the pity of it! She knows noth- 
ing of life. She no more realizes what she has done 
than a child of eight. Marriage! . . . without 
the least conception of the physical and moral responsibilities! It's a crime, Mac!" 

"But what can you do? " McClintock turned to 
the manager. " ' It was a 11 perfectly legal? 

".My word for it. The Reverend Henry Dolby 
performed the cermony, and his wife and daughter 
were witnesses."
