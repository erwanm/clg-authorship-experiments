destination, thousands of miles away, an infinitesimal 
spot in a terrifying space. 

She could visualize the picture she had presented, 
particularly the battered papier-match kitbag at her 
feet. In Europe or in America people would have 
smiled; but in Singapore — the half-way port of the 
world — where a human kaleidoscope tumbles con- 
tinuously east and west, no one had remarked her. 
She would never forget the agony of that first 
meal in the great dining room. She could have 
dined iilone in her room; but courage had demanded 
that she face the ordeal and have done with it. 
Every eye seemed focussed upon her; and yet she had 
known the sensation to be the conceit of her imagination. 

The beautiful gowns and the flashing bare shoulders and arms of the women had disturbed and dis- 
tressed her. Women, she had been taught, who 
exposed the flesh of their bodies under the eyes of 
man were in a special catagory of the damned. 
Almost instantly she had recognized the fallacy of 
such a statement. These women could not be bad. 





else the hotel would not have permitted them to 
enter! Still, the scene presented a riddle: to give 
immunity to the black women who went about all but 
naked and to damn the white for exposing their 
shoulders! 

She had eaten but little; all her hunger had been in 
her eyes —  and in her heart. Loneliness —  something 
that was almost physical: as if the vitaKty had been 
taken out of the air she breathed. The longing to 
talk to someone! But in the end she had gone to 
her room without giving in to the craving. 

Once in the room, the door locked, the sense of 
loneliness had dropped away from her as the mists 
used to drop away from the mountain in the morning. 
Even then she had understood vaguely that she had 
touched upon some philosophy of life: that one was 
never lonely when alone, only in the midst of crowds. 

Another picture slid across her vision. She saw 
herself begin a slow, sinuous dance: and stop suddenly in the middle of a figure, conscious that the 
dance was not impromptu, her own, but native — 
the same dance she had quitted but a few minutes 
gone. She had fallen into it naturally, the only 
expression of the dance she had ever seen or known, 
and that a stolen sweet. That was odd : when young 
people were joyous, they had to express it physically. 
But native ! She must watch out. 

She remembered that she had not gone to bed 
until two o'clock in the morning. She had carried a 




 

chair into the room veranda and had watched and 
listened until the night silences had lengthened and 
only occasionally she heard a voice or the rattle of 
rickshaw wheels in the courtyard. 

The great ordeal —  that which she had most 
dreaded —  had proved to be no ordeal at all. The 
kindly American consul-general had himself taken 
her to the bank, where her banknotes had been ex- 
changed for a letter of credit, and had thoroughly 
advised her. Everything had so far come to pass as 
the withered old Kanaka woman had foretold. 

"The Golden One knows that I have seen the 

world; therefore follow my instructions. Never 

glance sideways at man. Nothing else matters." 

The prison bars of circumstance, they no longer 

encompassed her. Her wings were oddly weak, but 

for all that she could fly. That was the glorious if 

bewildering truth. She had left for ever the cage, 

the galling leash : she was free. The misty caravans 

of which she had dreamed were become actualities. 

She had but to choose. All about her, hither and 

yon, lay the enticing Unknown. Romance! The 

romance of passing faces, of wires that carried voices 

and words to the far ends of the world, of tremendous 

mechanisms that propelled ships and trains! And, 

oh the beautiful books ! 

She swiftly knelt upon the floor and once more 
gathered the books to her heart. 



CHAPTER V 

AT DINNER the spinsters invited Ruth to sit 
at their table, an invitation she accepted 
JLL gratefully. She was not afraid exauctly, but 
there was that about her loneliness to-night she distrusted. Detached, it was not impossible that she 
would be forced to leave the dining room because of 
invading tears. To be near someone, even someone 
who made a pretense of friendliness, to hear voices, 
her own intermingling, would serve as a rehabilitating tonic. The world had grown dark and wide, and 
she was very small. Doubts began to rise up all 
about her, plucking at her confidence. Could she 
go through with it? She must. She would never, 
never go back. 

As usual the substantive sister —  Prudence — did all 
the talking for the pair; Angelina, the shadow, 
offered only her submitting nods. Sometimes she 
missed her cue and nodded aflSrmatively when the 
gesture should have been the reverse; and Prudence 
would send her a sharp glance of disapproval. 
Angelina's distress over these mischances was 
pathetic. 

None of this by-play escaped Ruth, whose sense of 
humour needed no developing. That she possessed 

 



 

any sense of humour was in itself one of those human 
Tniracles which metaphysicians are always pothering 
over without arriving anywhere; for her previous 
environment had been particularly humourless. But 
if she smiled at all it was with her eyes. To-night 
she could have hugged both the old maids. 

"Somebody ought to get hold of that young man ' 
said Prudence, grimly, as she nodded in Spurlock's 
direction. " Look at him ! '' 

Ruth looked. He was draining a glass, and as he 
set it down he shuddered. A siphon and a whisky 
bottle stood before him. He measured out the 
portion of another peg, the bottle wavering in his 
hand. His food lay untouched about his plate. 
There was no disgust in Ruth's heart, only an infinite 
pity; for only the pitiful understand. 
"I'm sorry," she said. 

"I have no sympathy," replied Prudence, "with a 
man who deliberately fuddles himself with strong 
drink." 

"You would, if you had seen what I have. Men in 
this part of the world drink to forget the things they 
have lost." 

"And what should a young man like this one have 
to forget?" Prudence demanded to know. 

"I wonder," said Ruth. "Couldn't you speak to 
him?" 

"What? —  and be insulted for my trouble? No, 
thank you ! " 





" That is it. You complain of a condition, but you 
leave the correction to someone else." 

The spinster had no retort to oflFer such directness. 
This child was frequently disconcerting. Prudence 
attacked her chicken wing. 

"I spoke to him, my interest might be mis- 
interpreted." 

"Where did you go to school?" Prudence asked, 
seeking a new channel, for the old one appeared to be 
full of hidden reefs.
