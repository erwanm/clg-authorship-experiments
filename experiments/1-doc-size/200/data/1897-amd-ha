people, leaving the two friends to discuss their 
business. He, too, found much to interest him; 
and he was amused at Delia's running comments, 
some of them very bright indeed. She was quite 
a spur to Ben, he found ; and he was surprised 
at the varied stock of knowledge Ben had 
accumulated. 

It did not seem as if they had explored half, 
when Mr. Whitney opened the door. 

; Young folks, we must be going, if we expect 
to reach home that very same night, like the old 
woman with her pig," he said. 

"Are you talked out?' asked Delia, archly; 
"for we haven't half looked through things.' 

"I want your brother to stay and have some 
supper with me. I 'in my own housekeeper now; 
but I think we could manage.'' 

" What fun it would be, " said Delia. " As there 
are no stores, we should have to start at the 
foundation of things." 

 

"I have a loaf of bread, and some cold mutton, 
and eggs, I think, and tea and coffee. Come, 
you had better accept my hospitality." 

"I must be home in the early evening," re- 
marked Doctor Joe. 

"And Hanny 's not to stay out after dark," 
appended Ben. 

"We are going down to Cockloft Hall," ex- 
plained Mr. Whitney. " I am sorry we cannot 
accept." 

"Then you must bring your happy family again. 
If they are fond of curiosities, the old house could 
entertain them all day long." 

" And if they are fond of adventures, which 
they are, they might put you to the test," said 
Delia, daringly. 

Herbert laughed at the vivacious tone. 

"Then you 'd have to find me in the mood. In 
that respect, I am variable." 

"Do you have a mood for each day? Then 
your friends could be sure ' 

" A good idea, like the ladies' reception-days. 
Must I put on the card, Serious, Jolly, Adventur- 
ous, etc. ? ' 

"And supernatural. I should come on the 
ghost days. For if ever a ghost walked out of its 
earthy habitation, I should think it would be here. 
Did you ever see a ghost, Mr. Herbert? ' 

" I have seen some queer things. But these up 
here," nodding his head, "seem a very well 
behaved community. I can't say that they have 
troubled me; and I've come down the road at 



twelve or so at night. Perhaps my imagination 
is not vivid enough in that line. Have you ever 
seen a ghost, Miss Whitney? ' 

' No, I have not, except the ghosts of my imagi- 
nation. I can shut my eyes now, and see them come 
trooping down that lonely road by twos and threes. " 

Herbert laughed again. "A vivid imagination 
is worth a good deal at times," he said. "There 
ought to be a ghost-walk about here; and next 
time you come over, we 'll arrange one so perfectly 
that he shall defy detection. I 'll walk a bit with 
you, if I am not a ghost." 

When he put on his wide-brimmed, rather 
high-crowned hat, he looked more Spanish than 
English. They went through another room that 
opened on a porch, and, from thence, through the 
garden, or an attempt at one that did not betoken 
signal success. 

The cemetery sloped down from a high hill that 
was such a thicket of woods it hid all indications 
of the City of the Dead. The placid river, in 
which there was only a gentle tide up here, lapped 
the shores with a little murmur as it came up 
from the bay. The green, irregular shore oppo- 
site showed here and there a house. The wood- 
robins were beginning their vespers already. 
Hanny thought them the sweetest singers she had 
ever heard. 

Just here there was a terraced garden-spot and 
an old house adorned with all kinds of blossoming 
shrubbery. 

" You see we two are guardians of the place, at 

 

either end. Miss Whitney, this house could 
tell some interesting tales of the bygone time; 
but the glory is departing. In a few years the 
city will stretch out and invade our solitude.' 

A wild spot of ground it was below, hilly, 
gravelly, sloping sharply down to the river. But 
people were beginning to take advantage of the 
shore-edge for business. There were shops, and 
a foundry stretching out smoky, dingy arms in 
various directions. 

They said their good-byes here, as they were in 
'sight of the old Gouverneur mansion. And no one 
guessed then that a tragedy of love and despera- 
tion to madness was soon to follow, and that in 
the dreary old house " Frank Forrester " was to lie, 
slain by his own hand, that he waved so jauntily 
to them as he bade them "Come again." 

They scrambled up the small ascent, and sprang 
over the wall. Here was 'where the Nine Worthies 
used to come for their merry-making in their 
exuberant youth, and, as one of their number said 
afterward, "enlivened the solitude by their mad- 
cap pranks and juvenile orgies." The house had 
not been much modernised up to that period. Its 
young owner, Mr. Kemble, who was the Patroon 
of the merry company, still held it. They found 
the old honeydew cherry-tree standing; but some 
of its long-armed branches were going to decay. 
The odd. octagonal summer-house had not then 


fallen down. 

They went up to the old room in the south- 
western angle, the green moreen chamber, as it 



had been called, where the Nine Worthies used to 
congregate, and where Irving concocted some 
choice bits of fun for the Salamagundi Club. 
And here was the great drawing-room where they 
disposed themselves to sociable naps on Sunday 
afternoons, the vine-covered porch on which they 
sat and smoked starlit evenings, and the grassy 
lawn over which they rambled. And now Mr. 
Washington Irving had been minister to Spain, 
and the guest of noted people in England and on 
the continent. He had won fame in more than 
one line, and hosts of appreciative readers. 

Hanny could hardly realise it all, as she thought 
of the still handsome though rather delicate man, 
past middle life, gracious and dignified and 
kindly, sitting on his own porch at Sunnyside. 
She couldn't help going back to her first love, 
the old "Knickerbocker History" that seemed so 
real to her, even now. 

The hand of improvement touched Cockloft 
Hall shortly after. The old summer-house was 
taken down; the famous cherry-tree, where the 
robins sang and reared their young for so many 
generations, succumbed to old age and wintry 
blasts ; but she was glad she had seen it in its 
romantic halo. 

They were not far from the upper railroad 
station then, - -the old Morris and Essex that had 
stirred up the country people mightily when it 
first went thundering through quiet vales, and 
screaming out at little way-stations. They were 
just in time for a train. The sun had dropped 

 

down behind the Orange Mountain, though the 
whole west was alive with changeful gold and 
scarlet, melting to fainter tints, changing to 
indescribable hues and visionary islands floating 
in seas of amber and chrysoprase.
