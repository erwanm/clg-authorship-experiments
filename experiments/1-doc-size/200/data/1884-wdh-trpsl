word in those days, they 'd considered him pretty 
much of a crank about it. He was trying as long 
as he lived to get that paint introduced ; but he 
couldn't make it go. The country was so poor they 
couldn't paint their houses with anything ; and father 
hadn't any facilities. It got to be a kind of joke 
with us ; and I guess that paint-mine did as much 
as any one thing to make us boys clear out as soon 
as we got old enough. All my brothers went West, 
and took up land ; but I hung on to New England, 
and I hung on to the old farm, not because the 
paint-mine was on it, but because the old house was 
and the graves. Well," said Lapham, as if unwill 
ing to give himself too much credit, " there wouldn't 
been any market for it, anyway. You can go 
through that part of the State and buy more farms 
than you can shake a stick at for less money than it 
cost to build the barns on 'em. Of course, it 's turned 
out a good thing. I keep the old house up in good 
shape, and we spend a month or so there every 
summer. M' wife kind of likes it, and the girls. 
Pretty place ; sightly all round it. I 've got a force 
of men at work there the whole time, and I Ve got 
a man and his wife in the house. Had a family 
meeting there last year ; the whole connection from 



 

out West. There !" Lapham rose from his seat and 
took- down a large warped, unframed photograph 
from the top of his desk, passing his hand over it, 
and then blowing vigorously upon it, to clear it of 
the dust. "There we are, all of us." 

" I don't need to look twice at you" said Bartley, 
putting his finger on one of the heads. 

" Well, that 's Bill," said Lapham, with a gratified 
laugh. " He 's about as brainy as any of us, I guess. 
He's one of their leading lawyers, out Dubuque 
way ; been judge of the Common Pleas once or 
twice. That's his son just graduated at Yale 
alongside of my youngest girl Good-looking chap, 
ain't he?" 

" SJie's a good-looking chap," said Bartley, with 
prompt irreverence. He hastened to add, at the 
frown which gathered between Lapham's eyes, 
" What a beautiful creature she is ! What a lovely, 
refined, sensitive face ! And she looks good, too." 

" She is good," said the father, relenting. 

"And, after all, that's about the best thing in a 
woman," said the potential reprobate. " If my wife 
wasn't good enough to keep both of us straight, I 
don't know what would become of me." 

"My other daughter," said Lapham, indicating 
a girl with eyes that showed large, and a face of 
singular gravity. "Mis' Lapham," he continued, 
touching his wife's effigy with his little finger. " My 
brother Willard and his family farm at Kankakee. 
Hazard Lapham and his wife Baptist preacher in 
Kansas. Jim and his three girls milling business 



 

at Minneapolis. Ben and his family practising 
medicine in Fort Wayne." 

The figures were clustered in an irregular group 
in front of an old farm-house, whose original ugliness 
had been smartened up with a coat of Lapham's own 
paint, and heightened with an incongruous piazza. 
The photographer had not been able to conceal the 
fact that they were all decent, honest-looking, sensible 
people, with a very fair share of beauty among the 
young girls ; some of these were extremely pretty, in 
fact. He had put them into awkward and constrained 
attitudes, of course ; and they all looked as if they 
had the instrument of torture which photographers 
call a head-rest under their occiputs. Here and there 
an elderly lady's face was a mere blur ; and some of 
the younger children had twitched themselves into 
wavering shadows, and might have passed for spirit- 
photographs of their own little ghosts. It was the 
standard family-group photograph, in which most 
Americans have figured at some time or other ; and 
Lapham exhibited a just satisfaction in it " I pre 
sume," he mused aloud, as he put it back on top of 
his desk, " that we sha'n't soon get together again, 
all of us." 

" And you say," suggested Bartley, " that you 
stayed right along on the old place, when the rest 
cleared out West V 

" No-o-o-o," said Lapham, with a long, loud drawl ; 
" I cleared out West too, first off. Went to Texas. 
Texas was all the cry in those days. But I got 
enough of the Lone Star in about three months, and 



 

I come back with the idea that Vermont was good 
enough for me." 

" Fatted calf business ? " queried Bartley, with his 
pencil poised above his note-book. 

"I presume they were glad to see me," said 
Lapham, with dignity. "Mother," he added gently, 
" died that winter, and I stayed on with father. I 
buried him in the spring ; and then I came down to 
a little place called Lumberville, and picked up what 
jobs I could get. I worked round at the saw-mills, 
and I was ostler a while at the hotel I always <li<l 
like a good horse. Well, I wa'n't exactly a college 
graduate, and I went to school odd times. I got to 
driving the stage after while, and by and by I Imnjld 
the stage and run the business myself. Then I hired 
the tavern-stand, and well to make a long story 
short, then I got married. Yes," said Lapham, with 
pride, " I married the school-teacher. We did pretty 
well with the hotel, and my wife she was always at 
me to paint up. Well, I put it off, and jM it off, as 
a man will, till one day I give in, and says I, ' Well, 
let 's paint up. Why, Pert,' m'wife's name 's Persis, 
' I 've got a whole paint-mine out on the farm. 
Let's go out and look at it.' So we drove out. I 'd 
let the place for seventy-five dollars a year to a 
shif'less kind of a Kanuck that had come down that 
way ; and I 'd hated to see the house with him in it ; 
but we drove out one Saturday afternoon, and we 
brought back about a bushel of the stuff in the buggy- 
seat, and I tried it crude, and I tried it burnt ; and 
I liked it. M'wife she liked it too. There wa'n't 




any painter by trade In the village, and I mixed it 
myself. Well, sir, that tavern's got that coat of 
paint on it yet, and it hain't ever had any other, and 
I don't know 's it ever will. Well, you know, I felt 
as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment, all 
the while ; and I presume I shouldn't have tried it, 
but I kind of liked to do it because father 'd always 
set so much store by his paint-mine. And when I'd 
got the first coat on," Lapham called it cut, " I 
presume I must have set as much as half an hour, 
looking at it and thinking how he would have enjoyed 
it. I 've had my share of luck in this world, and I 
ain't a-going to complain on my own account, but I Ve 
noticed that most things get along too late for most 
people. It made me feel bad, and it took all the 
pride out my success with the paint, thinking of 
father. Seemed to me I might 'a taken more inte 
rest in it when he was by to see ; but we've got to 
live and learn. Well, I called my wife out, I'd 
tried it on the back of the house, you know, and 
she left her dishes, I can remember she came out 
with her sleeves rolled up and set down alongside of 
me on the trestle, and says I, ' What do you think, 
Persis ?' And says she, ' Well, you hain't got a 
paint-mine, Silas Lapham ; you 've got a gold-mine.' 
She always was just so enthusiastic about things. 
Well, it was just after two or three boats had burnt 
up out West, and a lot of lives lost, and there was 
a great cry about non-inflammable paint, and I guess 
that was what was in her mind. ' Well, I guess it 
ain't any gold-mine, Persis,' says I ; ' but I guess it 



 

is a paint-mine. I 'm going to have it analysed, and 
if it turns out what I think it is, I 'm going to work 
it. And if father hadn't had such a long name, I 
should call it the Nehemiah Lapham Mineral Paint. 
But, any rate, every barrel of it, and every keg, 
and every bottle, and every package, big or little, 
has got to have the initials and figures N. L. f. 1835, 
S. L. t. 1855, on it. Father found it in 1835, and 
I tried it in 1855.'" 

" ' S. T. 1860 X.' business," said Bartley. 

" Yes," said Lapham, " but I hadn't heard of 
Plantation Bitters then, and I hadn't seen any of 
the fellow's labels. I set to work and I got a man 
down from Boston ; and I carried him out to the
