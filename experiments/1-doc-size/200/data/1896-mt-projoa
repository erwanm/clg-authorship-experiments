of that. We seem so delicately made, so destructible, so 
insubstantial ; yet it is easier to reduce a granite statue to 
ashes than it is to do that with a man's body. 

The sight of the stake sent physical pains tingling 
down the nerves of my body ; and yet, turn as I would, 
my eyes would keep coming back to it, such fascination 
has the gruesome and the terrible for us. 

The space occupied by the platforms and the stake was 
kept open by a wall of English soldiery, standing elbow to 
elbow, erect and stalwart figures, fine and sightly in their 
polished steel ; while from behind them on every hand 
stretched far away a level plain of human heads ; and 
there was no window and no housetop within our view, 
howsoever distant, but was black with patches and masses 
of people. 

But there was no noise, no stir ; it was as if the world 
was dead. The impressiveness of this silence and solem- 
nit) was deepened by a leaden twilight, for the sky was 
hidden by a pall of low-hanging storm-clouds ; and above 
the remote horizon faint winkings of heat-lightning played, 
and now and then one caught the dull mutterings and 
complainings of distant thunder. 

At last the stillness was broken. From beyond the 
square rose an indistinct sound, but familiar — curt, crisp 
phrases of command ; next I saw the plain of heads 
dividing, and the steady swing of a marching host was 
glimpsed between. My heart leaped for a moment. Was 
it La Hire and his hellions ? No — that was not their gait. 
No, it was the prisoner and her escort ; it was Joan of 



Arc, under guard, that was coming ; my spirits sank as 
low as they had been before. Weak as she was, they 
made her walk ; they would increase her weakness all 
they could. The distance was not great — it was but a 
few hundred yards — but short as it was it was a heavy 
tax upon one who had been lying chained in one spot for 
months, and whose feet had lost their powers from in- 
action. Yes, and for a year Joan had known only the cool 
damps of a dungeon, and now she was dragging herself 
through this sultry summer heat, this airless and suffocating 
void. As she entered the gate, drooping with exhaustion, 
there was that creature Loyseleur at her side with his 
head bent to her ear. We knew afterwards that he had 
been with her again this morning in the prison wearying 
her with his persuasions and enticing her with false 
promises, and that he was now still at the same work at 
the gate, imploring her to yield everything that would be 
required of her, and assuring her that if she would do this 
all would be well, with her: she would be rid of the 
dreaded English and find safety in the powerful shelter 
and protection of the Church. A miserable man, a stony- 
hearted man ! 

The moment Joan was seated on the platform she 
closed her eyes and allowed her chin to fall ; and so sat, 
with her hands nestling in her lap, indifferent to everything, 
caring for nothing but rest. And she was so white again ; 
white as alabaster. 

How the faces of that packed mass of humanity lighted 
up with interest, and with what intensity all eyes gazed 
upon this fragile girl ! And how natural it was ; for these 
people realised that at last they were looking upon that 
person whom they had so long hungered to see ; a person 
whose name and fame filled all Europe, and made all other 
names and all other renowns insignificant by comparison : 
Joan of Arc, the wonder of the time, and destined to be 
the wonder of all times ! And I could read as by print, 
in their marvelling countenances, the words that were 
drifting through their minds : ' Can it be true ; is it 
believable, that it is this little creature, this girl, this child 
with the good face, the sweet face, the beautiful face, the 
dear and bonny face, that has carried fortresses by storm, 
charged at the head of victorious armies, blown the might 
of England out of her path with a breath, and fought a 
long campaign, solitary and alone, against the massed 
brains and learning of France — and had won it if the fight 
had been fair ! ' 

Evidently Cauchon had grown afraid of Manchon 
because of his pretty apparent leanings toward Joan, for 
another recorder was in the chief place here, which left 
my master and me nothing to do but sit idle and look on. 

Well, I supposed that everything had been done which 
could be thought of to tire Joan's body and mind, but 
it was a mistake ; one more device had been invented. 
This was to preach a long sermon to her in that oppressive 
heat. 

When the preacher began, she cast up one distressed 

and disappointed look, then dropped her head again. This 

preacher was Guillaume Erard, an oratorical celebrity. 

He got his text from the Twelve Lies. He emptied upon 

Joan all the calumnies, in detail, that had been bottled up 

in that mess of venom, and called her all the brutal names 

that the Twelve were labelled with, working himself into a 

whirlwind of fury as he went on ; but his labours were 

wasted, she seemed lost in dreams, she made no sign, she 

did not seem to hear. At last he launched this apostrophe : 

' O France, how hast thou been abused ! Thou hast 

always been the home of Christianity ; but now, Charles, 

who calls himself thy King and governor, indorses, like the 

heretic and schismatic that he is, the words and deeds of a 

worthless and infamous woman ! ' Joan raised her head, 

and her eyes began to burn and flash. The preacher 

turned toward her : ' It is to you, Joan, that I speak, and 

I tell you that your King is schismatic and a heretic ! ' 

Ah, he might abuse her to his heart's content ; she 




could endure that ; but to her dying moment she could 
never hear in patience a word against that ingrate, that 
treacherous dog our King, whose proper place was here, 
at this moment, sword in hand, routing these reptiles and 
saving this most noble servant that ever King had in this 
world — and he would have been there if he had not been 
what I have called him. Joan's loyal soul was outraged, 
and she turned upon the preacher and flung out a few 
words with a spirit which the crowd recognised as being 
in accordance with the Joan of Arc traditions — 

' By my faith, sir ! I make bold to say and swear, on 
pain of death, that he is the most noble Christian of all 
Christians, and the best lover of the faith and the Church ! ' 
There was an explosion of applause from the crowd, 
which angered the preacher, for he had been aching long to 
hear an expression like this, and now that it was come at 
last it had fallen to the wrong person : he had done all the 
work, the other had carried off all the spoil. He stamped 
his foot and shouted to the sheriff — 
' Make her shut up ! ' 
That made the crowd laugh. 

A mob has small respect for a grown man who has to 
call on a sheriff to protect him from a sick girl. 

Joan had damaged the preacher's cause more with one 
sentence than he had helped it with a hundred ; so he was 
much put out, and had trouble to get a good start again. 
But he needn't have bothered ; there was no occasion. It 
was mainly an English-feeling mob. It had but obeyed a 
law of our nature — an irresistible law — to enjoy and ap- 
plaud a spirited and promptly delivered retort, no matter 
who makes it. The mob was with the preacher ; it had 
been beguiled for a moment, but only that ; it would 
soon return. It was there to see this girl burnt ; so that 
it got that satisfaction — without too much delay — it would 
be content. 

Presently the preacher formally summoned Joan to 
submit to the Church. He made the demand with confidence, 
for he had gotten the idea from Loyseleur and 
Beaup6re that she was worn to the bone, exhausted, and, 
would not be able to put forth any more resistance ; and, 
indeed, to look at her it seemed that they must be right. 
Nevertheless, she made one more effort to hold her 
ground, and said, wearily — 

' As to that matter, I have answered my judges before. 
I have told them to report all that I have said and done 
to our holy Father the Pope — to whom, and to God first, 
I appeal.' 

Again, out of her native wisdom, she had brought 
those words of tremendous import, but was ignorant of their 
value. But they could have availed her nothing in any 
case, now, with the stake there and these thousands of 
enemies about her. Yet they made every churchman there 
blench, and the preacher changed the subject with all 
haste. Well might those criminals blench, for Joan's 
appeal of her case to the Pope stripped Cauchon at once of 
jurisdiction over it, and annulled all that he and his judges 
had already done in the matter and all that they should do
