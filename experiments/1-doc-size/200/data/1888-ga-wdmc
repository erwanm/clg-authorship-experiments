candles lit and Sir Iltyd standing on the hearth- 
rug beside his daughter. The old gentleman 
came forward at once and greeted him with 
stately, old-fashioned courtesy, his stern, 
somewhat sad features relaxing at once under Dart- 
mouth's rare charm of manner. He was a fine- 
looking man, tall and slim like his daughter, but 
Very fair. His head, well developed, but by no 
means massive, and scantily covered with gray 
hair, was carried with the pride which was the 
bone and fibre of his nature. Pride, in fact, 
albeit a gentle, chastened sort of pride, was 
written all over him, from the haughty curve of his 
eyebrow to the conscious wave of his small,
delicate hand — pride, and love for his daughter, 
for he followed her every movement with the 
adoring eyes of a man for the one solace of a 
sad and lonely old age. 

" It is so awfully good of you to let me come 
up here so soon," exclaimed Dartmouth. " But 
what do you suppose I have done to prove my 
gratitude?" 

" Made the castle your own, I hope." 

" I have. I proceeded at once to make my- 
self, at home by smashing up the furniture. One 
of your handsomest cabinets is now in ruins 
upon my bedroom floor." 

Sir Iltyd looked at him with a somewhat puzzled
glance. He had lived in seclusion for 
nearly thirty years, and was unaccustomed to the 
facetiousness of the modern youth. " Has anything 
happened ' " he demanded anxiously. 

Dartmouth smiled, but gave an account of the 
disaster in unadorned English, and received 
forgiveness at once. Had he confessed to having 
chopped his entire tower to pieces. Sir Iltyd 
would have listened without a tightening of the 
lips, and with the air of a man about to invite 
his guest to make a bonfire of the castle if so it 
pleased him. As for Weir, her late education 
made her appreciate the humor of the situation, 
and she smiled sympathetically at Harold over 
her father's shoulder. 

They went into dinner a few moments later, 


and Sir Iltyd talked a good deal. Although a 
man of somewhat narrow limitations and one-
sided views, as was but natural, taking into 
consideration the fact that his mental horizon had 
not been widened out by contact with his fellow- 
men for twenty-five years, he was, for a recluse, 
surprisingly well-informed upon the topics of 
the day. Dartmouth could not forbear making 
some allusion to the apparent paradox, and his 
host smiled and told him that as history had 
been his favorite study all his life, he could 
hardly be so inconsistent as to ignore the work 
which his more active contemporaries were making 
for the future chronicler. He then drew 
from Dartmouth a detailed account of that restless
young gentleman's political experience in 
Russia, and afterward questioned him somewhat 
minutely about the American form of government 
He seemed to be pleased with the 
felicity of expression and the well-stored mind 
of his would-be son-in-law, and lingered at the 
table longer than was his habit. There were no 
formalities at Rhyd-Alwyn. Weir remained 
with them, and when her father finally rose and 
went over to the hearth-rug, as if loth to leave 
the society of the young people, she went and 
stood beside him. He laid his arm across 
her shoulders, then turned to Dartmouth with a 
sigh. "You would take her from me," he said, 
sadly, " do you know that you will leave me to 
a very lonely life ? " 



 

" Oh, you will see enough of us," replied Har- 
old, promptly. " We shall be back and forth all 
the time. And Crumford Hall, I can assure you, 
is not a bad place to come to for the shooting." 

Sir Iltyd shook his head: " I could not live 
out of Wales," he said; "and I have not slept 
under another roof for a quarter of a century. 
But it is good of you to say you would not 
mind coming once in a while to this lonely old 
place, and it would make the separation easier 
to bear." 

He left them shortly after, and as he took 
Harold's hand in good-night, he retained it a 
moment with an approving smile, then passed a 
characteristic Welsh criticism: "It is a small 
hand," he said, "and a very well-shaped hand; 
and your feet, too. I am willing to acknowledge 
to you that I am weak enough to have a horror 
of large hands and feet. Good-night. I have 
to thank you for a very pleasant evening." 

II. 

" Harold," said Weir, the next morning after 
breakfast, as the door closed behind Sir Iltyd, 
"I shall entertain you until luncheon by showing 
you the castle." 

" My dear girl," said Harold, smiling, " let 
your role of hostess sit lightly upon you. I do 
not want to be entertained. I am perfectly 
happy." 




" Of that I have no doubt. Nevertheless I 
want you to see the castle, particularly the
picture-gallery, where all my ancestors be." 

" Then, by my troth, will I go, fair Mistress 
Penrhyn, for a goodly show your ancestors be, I 
make no doubt; " and Dartmouth plunged his 
hands into his pockets and looked down at her 
with a broad smile. 

Weir lifted her head. " My English is quite 
as pure as yours," she said. "And you certainly 
cannot accuse me of using what the London girls 
call 'slang. ' " 

This time Dartmouth laughed aloud. " No, 
my dear," he said, '' not even Shaksperean slang. 
But let us investigate the mysteries of the castle 
by all means. Lead, and I will follow." 

" There are no mysteries," said Weir; " we 
have not even a ghost. Nor have we a murder, 
or crime of any sort, to m'ake us blush for our 
family tree." 

" Happy tree ! Mine has a blush for every 
twig, and a drop curtain for every branch. 
Thank God for the Penrhyn graft! Let us hope 
that it will do as much good as its fairest flower 
has already done the degenerate scion of all the 
Dartmouths. But, to the castle! I would get 
through — I mean, I would gaze upon its an- 
tiquities as soon as possible." 

"This castle is very interesting, Mr. Dart- 
mouth," replied Weir, elevating her chin; "you 
have nothing so old in England." 




" True, nor yet in Jerusalem, O haughtiest of 
Welsh maidens ! I esteem it a favor that I am 
not put below the salt." 

Weir laughed. " What a tease you are ! But 
you know that in your heart your pride of 
family is as great as mine. Only it is the ' fad ' 
of the day to affect to despise birth and lineage. 
We of Wales are more honest.'' 

" Yes, it is your sign and seal, and it sits well 
upon you. I don't affect to despise birth and 
lineage, my dear. If I could not trace my ancestry
back to the first tadpole who loafed his 
life away in the tropical forests of old, I should 
be miserable." 

He spoke jestingly, but he drew himself up as 
he spoke, his lip was supercilious, and there was 
an intolerant light in his eye. At that moment he 
did not look a promising subject for the Liberal 
side of the House, avowedly as were his sympathies 
in that quarter. Weir, however, gave him 
an approving smile, and then commanded him to 
follow her. 

She took him over the castle, from the dungeons 
below to the cell-like rooms in the topmost towers. 
She led him through state bedrooms, in which had 
slept many a warlike Welsh prince, whose bones 
could scarcely be in worse order than the magnificence 
which once had sheltered them. She piloted 
him down long galleries with arcades on one
