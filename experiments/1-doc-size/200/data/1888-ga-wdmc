to him in this soft, quiet Southern night. 



VII. 

Dartmouth opened his eyes and looked 
about him. The storm had died, the waves were 
at rest, and he was alone. He let his head fall 
back against the frame of the window, and his 
eyes closed once more. What a dream ! — so 
vivid! — so realistic! Was it not his actual life? 
Could he take up the threads of another ? He 
felt ten years older; and, retreating down the 
dim, remote corridors of his brain, were trooping 
memories of a long, regretted, troubled, eventful 
past. In a moment they had vanished like 
ghosts and left no trace; he could recall none of 
them. He opened his eyes again and looked 
down the gallery, and gradually his perceptions 
grasped its familiar lines, and he was himself 
once more. He rose to his feet and put his hand 
to his head. That woman whom he had taken 
for the ghost of one dead and gone had been 
Weir, of course. She had arisen in her sleep 
and attired herself like the grandmother whose 
living portrait she was; she had piled up her 
hair and caught her white gown up under her 
bosom; and, in the shadows and mystery of night, 
small wonder that she had looked as if the can- 
vas in the gallery below had yielded her up! But 
what had her words meant ? — her words, and that 
dream ? — but no — they were not what he wanted. 
There had been something else — what was it? 



He felt as if a mist had newly arisen to cloud 
his faculties. There had been something else 
which had made him not quite himself as he had 
stood there with his arms about the woman who 
had been Weir, and yet not Weir. Above the 
pain and joy and passion which had shaken him, 
there had been an unmistakable perception of — 
an attribute — a quality — of another sort — of a 
power, of which he, Harold Dartmouth, had 
never been conscious— of — of — ah, yes ! of the 
power to pour out at the feet of that woman, in 
richest verse, the love she had awakened, and 
make them both immortal. What were the 
words ? They had been written legibly in his 
brain; he remembered now. He had seen and 
read them — yes, at last, at last! " Her face ! her 
form!" No! no! not that again. Oh, why would 
they not come ? They had been there, the words; 
the sense must be there, the inspiration, the bat- 
tling for voice and victory. They were ready to 
pour through his speech in a flood of song, but 
that iron hand forced them back — down, down, 
setting blood and brain on fire. Ah ! what was 
that ? Far off, at the end of some long gallery, 
there was a sweet, dying strain of music, and 
there were words — gathering in volume; they 
were rolling on; they were coming; they were 
thundering through his brain in a mighty chorus! 
There ! he had grasped them — No ! that iron 
hand had grasped them — and was hurling them 




back. In another moment it would have forced 
them down into their cell and turned the key ! 
He must catch and hold one of them ! Yes, he 
had it! Oh ! victory ! — "Her eyes, her hair." 

Dartmouth thrust out his hands as if fighting 
with a physical enemy, and he looked as if he had 
been through the agonies of death. The con- 
flict in his brain had suddenly ceased, but his 
physical strength was exhausted. He turned and 
walked uncertainly to his room; then he collected 
his scattered wits sufficiently to drop some lauda- 
num and take it, that he might ward off, if pos- 
sible, the attack of physical and spiritual prostra- 
tion which had been the result of a former ex, 
perience of a similar kind. Then, dressed as he 
was, he flung himself on the bed and slept. 

VIII. 

When Dartmouth awoke the next day, the sun 
was streaming across the bed and Jones's 
anxious face was bending over him. 

" Oh, Mr. 'Arold," exclaimed Jones, " you've 
got it again." 

Dartmouth laughed aloud. " One would think 
I had delirium tremens," he said. 

He put his hand over his eyes, and struggled 
with the desire to have the room darkened. The 
melancholy had fastened itself upon him, and he 
knew that for three or four days he was to be 



the victim of one of his unhappiest moods. The 
laudanum had lulled his brain and prevented 
violent reaction after its prolonged tension; but 
his spirits were at zero, and his instinct was to 
shut out the light and succumb to his enemy 
without resistance. If he had been anywhere 
but at Rhyd-Alwyn he would not have thought 
twice about it; but if he shut himself up in his 
room, not only would Weir be frightened and un- 
happy, but it was probable that Sir Iltyd would 
question the desirability of a son-in-law who was 
given to prolonged and uncontrollable attacks of 
the blues. He dressed and went down-stairs, 
but Weir was nowhere to be found, and after a 
search through the various rooms and corners of 
the castle which she was in the habit of 
frequenting, he met her maid and was informed that Miss 
Penrhyn was not well and would not come down- 
stairs before dinner. The news was very 
unwelcome to Dartmouth. Weir at least would have 
been a distraction. Now he must get through a 
dismal day, and fight his enemy by himself. To 
make matters worse, it was raining, and he could 
not go out and ride or hunt. He went into Sir 
Iltyd's library and talked to him for the rest of 
the morning. Sir Iltyd was not exciting, at his 
best, and to-day he had a bad cold; so after 
lunch Dartmouth went up to his tower and 
resigned himself to his own company. He sat 
down before the fire, and taking his head 
between his hands allowed the blue devils to 
triumph. He felt dull as well as depressed; but for 
a time he made an attempt to solve the problem 
of the phenomenon to which he had been twice 
subjected. That it was a phenomenon he did not 
see any reason to doubt. If he had spent his life 
in a vain attempt to write poetry and an 
unceasing wish for the necessary inspiration, there 
would be nothing remarkable in his mind 
yielding suddenly to the impetus of accumulated 
pressure, wrenching itself free of the will's 
control, and dashing off on a wild excursion of its 
own. But he had never voluntarily taken a pen 
in his hand to make verse, nor had he even felt 
the desire to possess the gift, except as a part of 
general ambition. He may have acknowledged 
the regret that he could not immortalize himself 
by writing a great poem, but the regret was the 
offspring of personal ambition, not of yearning 
poetical instinct. But the most extraordinary 
phase of the matter was that such a tempest 
could take place in a brain as well regulated as 
his own. He was eminently a practical man, and 
a good deal of a thinker. He had never been 
given to flights of imagination, and even in his 
attacks of melancholy, although his will might be 
somewhat enfeebled, his brain could always work 
clearly and cleverly. The lethargy which had 
occasionally got the best of him had invariably 
been due to violent nervous shock or strain, and 

was as natural as excessive bodily languor after 
violent physical effort. Why, then, should his 
brain twice have acted as if he had sown it with 
eccentric weeds all his life, instead of planting it 
with the choicest seeds he could obtain, and 
watering and cultivating them with a patience 
and an interest which had been untiring ? 

But the explanation of his attempt to put his 
unborn poem into words gave him less thought 
to-day than it had after its first occurrence; 
there were other phases of last night's 
experience weirder and more unexplainable still. 
Paramount, of course, was the vision or dream — 
which would seem to have been induced by some 
magnetic property possessed and exerted by 
Weir. Such things do not occur without cause, 
and he was not the sort of man to yield himself, 
physically and mentally, his will and his 
perceptions, to the unconscious caprice of a somnam- 
bulist. And the scene had cut itself so deeply 
into the tablets of his memory that he found 
himself forgetting more than once that it was not an 
actual episode of his past. He wished he could 
see Weir, and hear her account of her mental 
experiences of those hours. If her dream should 
have been a companion to his, then the 
explanation would suggest itself that the scene might 
have been a vagary of her brain; that in some 
way which he did not pretend to explain, she had 
hypnotized him, and that his brain had received
