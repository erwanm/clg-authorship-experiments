should have this faculty, but it does ap- 
pear to produce a curious kind of com- 
bustion. Did you ever feel your fingers 




tingle and burn when yon touched three 
or four pennies in your pocket, and could 
you not almost taste the delightful taffy- 
candy that the little old woman, two 
doors from the school, sold? 

Mrs. Adams ' pale face and troubled 
eyes interfered with Jessie’s peace of 
mind. She certainly thought yesterday 
that if she had a dollar she would give 
it to her. Why did she not want to now ? 

Clara Adams hasn’t been to school 
to-day,” Miss Trusdell said. "Who 
goes near her house?” 

Jessie swallowed a great lump that 
seemed to rush up from her heart. 

'I’ll call. Miss Trusdell.” 

Thank you, Jessie. Clara ought not 
miss a day. I am afraid she is sick. ’ ’ 

So Jessie went around by another path, 
almost afraid to pass Warner’s again. 




It was a cold December day, cloudy now, 
and with the appearance of snow. The 
wind nipped Jessie’s rosy cheeks, but 
she did not mind. Here was the little 
cottage— rather cold and forlorn-looking, 
it must be confessed. Jamie answered 
her tap at the door. 

‘‘Oh! come in. Miss Jessie!” Mrs. 
Adams exclaimed; and Jamie shut the 
door quickly, so the biting air would 
not rush in. 

“I called to see why Clara wasn’t at 
school to-day,” Jessie said. 

Clara blushed. Mrs. Adams looked 
rather troubled. 

“You’re not sick!’ 

“No, Miss Jessie, it wasn’t that. But 
Clara hasn’t any shoes. She would 
freeze her feet in thosfe old ones ; besides 
they’re out to the ground.” 




Jessie cast a furtive glance at them — 
old and shabby, indeed. She thought of 
her own half-worn boots, but although 
Clara was a smaller girl, her feet were 
larger than Jessie’s. No, that would not 
do. 

‘‘I ordered her a pair at Mr. Gregg’s, 
and they ’re done, only he will not let me 
have them until I pay down a little. 
And I’ve just money enough for my rent, 
which is due to-morrow. Mr. Dallas is a 
hard landlord.” 

‘'Then you have all the money?” 
Jessie said, gladly. 

' ‘ Yes, I am thankful for that ; hut Clara 
must wait until next week. I shall have 
to earn some more.” 

Jessie talked to Jamie and Charley 
quite a while, and listened to the praises 
of her own dear mamma, who was always 




doing a kind turn for everybody. And 
a plan came into her mind ; but then she 
could not have a crying doll, nor a paint- 
box, nor any of those charming toys that 
she half coveted. She said good-by to 
them presently, and went straight to Mr. 
Gregg’s. 

A woman in a faded shawl was stand- 
ing by the untidy counter. She had been 
binding some shoes, and brought them 
home. 

can’t give it to you, because I 
haven’t a cent in the place,” Mr. Gregg 
was saying. ‘ ' People won ’t pay me, and 
I can’t pay others.” 

"But we actually haven’t anything in 
the house— not a mouthful of dinner 
even”; and here the poor woman’s 
tremulous voice broke down. 

Jessie felt like crying, too; but she 




winked away the tears with a great 
effort. Then she asked Mr. Gregg about 
Clara 's shoes. 

‘ ' There they are, ’ ' he said, rather 
brusquely, and nodded his head toward 
a stout pair standing on a little shelf. 
‘'Good, strong ones, too, and dirt cheap, 
yet they can’t pay for them. I’m done 
trusting; it’s a poor plan, and keeps me 
like a beggar.” 

Then he hammered spitefully upon 
his lapstone, and looked savage. He was 
a surly old fellow. 

‘‘Will you let her have them if I give 
you a dollar now, and promise to pay 
the rest if they can’t?” Jessie asked, 
bravely. 

“Yes, Miss.” 

Out came Jessie’s dollar. Spent for a 
pair of coarse shoes that had not a bit of 



beauty or grace, like the fairy or the 
doll, or twenty other things. 

The poor woman approached again. 
‘'Oh, Mr. Gregg— 

‘'Well, take it,’' he said, ungraciously. 

The thin fingers clutched it nervously, 
and she almost stared at Jessie. 

‘‘Will you send them down to Mrs. 
Adams, to-night? I'll ask papa for 
the rest of the money. How much is 
it!’' 

‘ ‘ Only a dollar. Cheap enough, I must 
say; but I work for about nothing.’’ 

When Jessie was in the fresh air, try- 
ing to breathe out the smell of wet 
leather and shoemaker’s wax, a hand 
was laid upon her shoulder. 

“Heaven bless you, child,” a faint 
voice said. “You’ve done a kind deed 
for a friend and been the means of 



blessing a stranger. My poor old 
mother and I were absolutely at starva- 
tion point. God must have sent you 
hither. " 

Jessie’s heart swelled too full for 
utterance. The temptations in W arner ’s 
window were nothing to her then. She 
ran down the street with a light, happy 
heart. 

‘ ‘How late you are I ’ ’ Mrs. Marsh said, 
as Jessie entered. It was dusk in the 
cozy sitting-room. 

“Mamma,” she said, presently, “I 
must tell you, I have spent my dollar. 
And I’ve had such an odd time! I’m 
satisfied, though.”
