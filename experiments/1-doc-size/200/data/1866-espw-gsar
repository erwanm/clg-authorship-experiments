thorne, I should like — well, I think I should 
like to pound that doctor with a tack-hammer, 
and then put some cayenne pepper on his hand- 
kerchief, and then pinch him, and then choke 
him a little, — just a little, not enough to be 
impolite, exactly, you know.” 


“ He docs all he can for me,” said Peace, 
laughing, “ and he is very kind, I ’m sure.” 

“ If it weren’t for his whiskers,” considered 
Gypsy, “ such solemn-looking things ! They 
look like grave-stones, exactly, — little black 
slate grave-stones, fringed on the edge.” 

“ He ’s good enough to her, I 'm sure,” ob- 
served Aunt Jane, who sat sewing by the 
window, “ and what with the jelly, and tongue, 
and books, and nobody knows what not, your 
ma keeps sendin’ her, I don’t think Peace has 
much to complain of” 

” Perhaps you would if you had to lie from 
morning to night with a pain in your back, and 
your father and mother dead, and nobody to ” — 
began Gypsy, with flashing eyes, and stopped. 
Then there was the old story over again, — 
Peace was grieved, and Aunt Jane was angry, 
and Gypsy was sorry. Presently Aunt Jane went 
out on an errand, and Gypsy said so. Peace 
sighed, but made no answer. Only, after a time, 
she said something, half to herself, about “ a little 
while,” that Gypsy did not exactly understand. 



“ The worse you feel, the more of an angel 
you are,” said Gypsy, in a pause. 

“ Oh, Gypsy ! ” 

“Yes, you are,” nodded Gypsy; “and I’m 
cross and bothered and worried about Tom, 
and, put it all together, I don’t begin to have 
as hard a time as you. When I come here, and 
look right into your eyes, I am so ashamed of 
myself, — why, I ’m so ashamed. Peace ! ” 

Peace raised her quiet eyes, and then she 
turned them away, for they had grown suddenly 
dark and dim. 

“ But I don’t have anything but myself to 
bear, Gypsy. It is a great deal easier to take 
things ourselves than to see them coming on 
somebody we love so very dearly.” 

“Yes,” said Gypsy, thinking for the moment 
how thankful she would be if she could be the 
soldier in Tom’s place; or how it seemed as if 
she would go to bed and lie there like Peace, 
if she could only make Tom the noble, prin- 
cipled, successful man that he might be, — that 
she was afraid at times he would never be. 



‘Ye-cs; but then, you see, I have Tom, to 
begin ivithT 

And Peace said nothing to that. 

Presently, she wanted to know what they 
heard from him. 

“ Well, we had a letter day before yesterday, 
and he said he was pretty well, and was over 
that terrible neuralgia, — he has had it almost 
ever since he has been there. But he thought 
there was going to be another fight, and so, you 
know, I have to go and think about it, and 
mother sits upstairs in the dark, and I know 
she ’s been crying, as well as I want to.” 

Peace did not say, “ Oh, he won’t get hurt. 
He wasn’t last time. The way not to have a 
thing happen is not to expect it. Look on the 
bright side,” &c., &c., &c. That sorry sort 
of sympathy it was not her fashion to give. 
Of course it was as possible for Tom to be 
wounded as any one else, and she could not have 
deluded Gypsy into thinking it was not, if she 
had tried. But she turned and kissed the cheek 
that was touching hers. 




“ It was so dreadful at first,” said Gypsy, 
who, when she once began to talk to Peace 
about Tom, never knew where to stop; “you 
sec, father, — I guess I told you, didn’t I? — 
well, he was so angry ! I never saw him look 
so in all my life. He said Tom was a disgrace 
to the family, and he said he would go right on 
and bring him home, — Tom is under age, you 
know, and he could do it, and I was so terribly 
afraid he would, and that would make Tom just 
as wicked as he could be, I know, he ’d be so 
angry. But mother talked him over. Well, 
then he sat right down and wrote a letter to 
Tom, and I never saw what was in it, but I 
guess it was awful. I don’t believe but what 
mother talked him round not to send that, too, 
for I saw her tearing up some letter-paper that 
night, and she was just as pale ! But by-and- 
by father didn’t seem to be angry, but just 
sorry. He was walking back and forth, back 
and forth, in the entry, and he never knew I 
saw him, and he shut up his hands together 
tight, and once I heard him groan right out 



loud, and say ‘ Poor boy, poor boy ! ’ and you ’d 
better believe I thought I was going to cry. 
Then did I tell you about our having prayers?” 

“No.” 

“Didn’t? Well, that was the worst of it. 
You see they had been shut up together almost 
all the afternoon and evening, talking it over, I 
suppose, — he and mother, I mean, — and no- 
body ate any supper but Winnie (he ate six 
slices of bread and two baked apples, and 
wanted to know if Tom got killed if he couldn’t 
have his gun), and I couldn’t go to bed, and 
Winnie would n’t, — he acted just as if it was a 
holiday, and said he was going to sit up till nine 
o’clock, because Tom had gone to the wars ; — 
so we just sat round and looked at each other, 
and it grew dark, and we could hear them 
talking upstairs, and it was dreadful. Then 
when Winnie saw me feeling for my handkerchief, 
he began to think he must cry too; so he 
stood up against the wall, and opened his mouth, 
and set up such a shout, — it was enough to 
wake the dead ! and I had enough to do hush- 



ing him up, but it made me laugh, and I 
couldn’t help it to save me. Well, then, it 
kept growing darker, and pretty soon they came 
down, and father called in Patty, just as if 
somebody were dead or something, and told her 
that Mr. Tom had enlisted; then he sent her 
out, and we all sat down, and he said : ‘ Children, 
Tom has done wrong, and we are sorry; 
but we have decided to let him stay in the army 
if he wishes, and now we will pray God to bless 
it to him, and to bring him home to us if it be 
His will.’ And then we all knelt down, and he 
began to pray, and I tell you, Peace, he loves 
Tom Breynton ! I did wish Tom could have 
heard him, and then, perhaps, he would forget 
about some of the times he has worried him 
so. I guess we were all choking before we 
got up, — except Winnie; he was sound asleep 
on the floor when we went to pick him 
up. 

“ So after that they wrote to Tom, but I 
don’t know what they said, and we all wrote to 
him, and his next letter sounded dreadfully 


sorry. Now, I believe something, Peace Maythorne.” 

“What is it?” 

“Well, Tom is just sick of it, only he won’t 
say so.” 

“ Why, what makes you think that? ” 

“ Oh, he keeps praising it up so much, for 
one thing. When Tom likes a thing firstrate, 
he doesn’t keep talking about it. Then once in 
a while he lets out a sentence about the rations 
being rather different from mother’s sponge cake 
and mince pies, and he says the marches tire 
him dreadfully. Then there ’s the neuralgia. 
He’s real patriotic, Tom is, and just as brave; 
but mother says he isn’t strong enough for it, 
and father says such young boys always go 
more from love of adventure than anything else, 
and almost always wish they had stayed at home.
