Petrarch, referring to himself, de- 
clared and, Tiberius might have said 
the same thing. He was in love with 
solitude; ill with efforts for the unattained; sick with the ingratitude of 
man. Presently it was decided that 
he had lived long enough. He was 
suffocated —beneath a mattress at that. 
Csesar had dreamed of a universal 
monarchy of which he should be 
king; he was murdered. That dream 
was also Anthony's; he killed himself. 
Cato had sought the restoration of 
the republic, and Brutus the attainment of virtue ; both committed 
suicide. Under the empire dreamers 
fared ill. Tiberius was a dreamer. 



 



In a palace where ii curious conception of the love of Atalanta and 
Meleager was said to figure on the 
walls, there was a door on which was 
a legend, imitated from one that overhung the Theban hbrary of Osy- 
mandias — Pharmacy of 
the Soul. It v;is there Tiberius 
dreamed. 

On the ivory shelves were the 
philters of Parthenius, libeled De 
Amatoriis A ecHonibtis  the Sybaris 
of Clitonymus, the Erotopmgnia of 
Lsevius, the maxims and instructions 
of Elephantis, the nine books of 
Sappho. There also were the pathetic 
adventures of Odatis and Zariadres, 
which Chares of Mitylene had given 
to the world; the astonishing tales of 
that early Cinderella, Rhodopis; and 
with them those romances of Ionian 
nights by Aristides of Milet, which 
Crassus took with him when he set 



 



out to subdue the Parthians, and 
which, found in the booty, were read 
aloud to the people that they might 
judge the morals of a nation that pretended to rule the world. 

Moral, certainly they were not; but 
like everything else which came from 
Greece, they were the work of a mas- 
ter in art. Concerning Aristidcs of 
Milet history is silent, but it may be 
safel}- conjectured that his life differed 
from' that of his heroes. As often as 
not the man who sounds the cymbals 
to the proprieties and plaj-s the flute 
to ethereal affection, conceals beneath 
obsequious cant the stigmata of satisfied vice. It is he who in vichy-water 
phrases pays to virtue the tribute of 
sin. On the other hand a tendency 
toward eroticism is the surest indication of chastity. It is continence that 
makes the St. Anthony. In the blood 
of the chaste cantharides abound. 



 



Whether such medicaments are serviceable to the soul is a different matter. Tiberius had other drugs on the 
ivory shelves — magic preparations that 
transported him to fabulous hetds. 
There was a work by Hecatsus, with 
which he could visit Hyperborea, that 
land where happiness was a birthright, 
inalienable at that; et a happiness so 
sweet that it must have been cloying; 
for the people who enjoyed it, and with 
it the appanage of limitless life, killed 
themselves from sheer ennui. Theo- 
pompus disclosed to him a stranger 
vista — a continent beyond the ocean — 
one where there were immense cities, 
and where two rivers flowed — the 
River of Pleasure and the River of 
Pain. With larabulus he discovered 
the Fortunate Isles, where there were 
men with elastic bones, bifurcated 
tongues ; men who never married, who 
worshipped the sun, whose life was an 



 



uninterrupted delight, and who, when 
overtaken by age, lay on a perfumed 
grass that produced a voluptuous 
death. Evhemerus, a terrible atheist, 
whose Sacred History the early bishops 
wielded against polytheism until 
they discoviired it was double-edged, 
took him to Panchaia, an island where 
incense grew; where property was 
held in common; where there was but 
one law —  Justice, yet a justice different from our own, one which Hugo 
must have intercepted when he made an entrancing yet enigmatical apparition exclaim: 


And in this paradise, where nature 
laughed the seasons through, there 
was a temple, and before it a column, 
about which, in Panchaian characters, 
ran a history of ancient kings, who, to 
the astonishment of the tourist, were 
found to be none other than the gods 



 



whom the universe adored, and who 
in earlier days had announced themselves divinities, the better to rule the 
hearts and minds of man. 

With other guides Tiberius journeyed through lands where dreams 
come true. Aristeas of Proconnesus 
led him among the Arimaspi, a curious 
people who passed their lives fighting 
for gold with griffons in the dark. 
With Isogonus he descended the 
valley of IsmSus, where wild men 
were, whose feet turned inwards. In 
Albania he found a race with pink 
eyes and white hair; in Sarmatia 
another that ate only on alternate 
days. Agatharcides took him to 
Libya, and there introduced him to 
the Psyllians, in whose bodies was a 
poison deadly to serpents, and who, to 
test the fidelity of their wives, placed 
their children in the presence of 
snakes; if the snakes fled they 



 

their wives were pure, Callias took 
him further yet, to the home of 
the hermaphrodites ; Nymphodorus 
showed him a race of fascinators who 
used enchanted words. With Apollonides he encountered women who 
killed with their eyes those on whom 
they looked too long. Megasthenes 
guided him to the Astomians, whose 
garments were the down of feathers, 
and who lived on the scent of the 



In his cups they all passed, confusedly, before him; the hermaphrodites 
whispered to the rose  — breathers 
secrets of impossible love; the griffons bore to him women with magical 
eyes; the Albanians danced with 
elastic feet; he heard the shrill call of 
the Psyllians, luring the serpents to 
death; the column of Panchaia un- 
veiled its mysteries; the Hyperboreans 
the reason of their fear of life, and on 



 

the wings of the chimera he set out 
again in search of that continent 
which haunted antiquity and which 
lay beyond the sea. 




"Another Phaethon for the universe," Tiberius is reported to have 
muttered, as he gazed at his nephew 
Caius, nicknamed Caligula, who was
