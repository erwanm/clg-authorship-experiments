"From which direction did you come?"

"West. I'm from the Upper Mississippi."

"Ah!"

"I went to Galena some five or six months ago; and have since been
actively engaged in lead-mining. A great business that, Mr. Jasper."

"Ah?" This "ah?" was particularly chilling.

"There are more rapid fortunes made at the lead-mines in the
neighbourhood of Galena, at present, than in any part of the United
States," said Martin, approaching, by rapid advances, the subject
nearest to his thoughts.

"You think so?" returned Jasper, with cold incredulity.

"I know so," was the positive response. "I could point you to a dozen
men who have made their tens of thousands annually for the last five
or ten years."

"It is easy to talk about making tens of thousands, Martin; but the
fact itself is a more difficult matter."

"A fact is a fact, however, Mr. Jasper," said the other. "What is
done, is done."

"Of course."

"It is a fact that money is made at the lead-mines, hand over fist,"
continued Martin. "Of this I am prepared to give you the strongest
kind of evidence."

"Why should you be so anxious to convince me of this fact?" returned
the merchant. "I have quite as many irons in the fire now as I can see
to."

"Ah! That may be," said Martin, forcing to his rather hard features a
bland smile. "But these new irons I will keep from burning."

"It's no use, Martin, to talk of lead-mines to me," said Jasper
firmly. "I am spread out enough already. Contraction, not expansion,
is my present motto. I've met with more than one heavy loss since I
saw you."

"Have you, indeed? I'm sorry for that. But a false card will turn up
now and then, you know. The game in the long run is sure."

"We're sure of nothing," replied Jasper, with considerable feeling.

"I wouldn't like to say that. Of course, all plans will not succeed;
for man's judgment is far from possessing the virtue of infallibility.
But human reason would be a poor endowment, did it not lead us, in
most cases, to right conclusions, if we are careful in our modes of
using this high faculty."

"The purpose of your visit to the East," said Jasper, who understood
perfectly the man with whom he was dealing, and, therefore, determined
to know at once the length and breadth of what he was expected to
do, "is, I presume, to enlist some capitalists here in a lead-mining
speculation?"

"My ideas do not extend quite that far," was Martin's answer. "Too
many cooks, you are aware, sometimes spoil the broth. To come to the
point at once, let me explain the purpose of my present journey to the
East."

"Well; I am all attention."

"My fur-trade business, as I wrote you a year ago, turned out
disastrously."

"Yes."

"After that, I opened a small store in one of the frontier towns, and
I did very well, all things considered. But the gain was too slow to
suit my ideas of things; so, meeting with a fair chance, I sold out,
and bought a lead-mine, which I have been working ever since to
good profit. Recently, I struck upon one of the richest veins ever
discovered. If properly worked, it will yield a rapid fortune. But I
have not sufficient capital to avail myself of the advantages offered,
and have come on here to lay the matter before you, and to offer you a
share in the business."

Jasper shook his head, saying--

"I have more business on my hands now, Martin, than I can possibly
attend to."

"You don't know what you are declining, Mr. Jasper," urged Martin
warmly. "You havn't yet looked at the statements which I am prepared
to lay before you."

"I do know one thing," was the feeling answer, "and that is, that I am
declining trouble and cost. About that part of the business, there can
be little question."

"Then," said Martin, his manner changing, "I am to understand that you
do not wish to join me in this matter?"

"Yes. I would like you to understand that distinctly."

"Very well. I am sorry you refuse so advantageous an investment of
money; for right sure am I that no other investment you can make will
turn out as this would have done. But, as you have declined, I will
not offer a share in my good fortune to any one else; but prosecute
the work to my own advantage."

"I thought you hadn't the capital to do that," said Jasper, speaking
with ill-repressed eagerness.

"Nor have I," coolly answered Martin. "The proposition I was about to
make was this--an advance of twenty thousand dollars capital on your
part, to constitute you an equal partner in the mine. But this you
decline."

"Certainly! certainly! I would not have entertained it for a moment."

"Exactly. So I have already inferred. I will, therefore, as just said,
retain this advantage in my own hands. But, Mr. Jasper, I shall need
some help."

The visitor fixed his eyes keenly on the merchant as he said this.
There was a momentary pause. Then he resumed.

"I shall only want about ten thousand dollars, though; and this you
must obtain for me."

"Martin! Do you think I am made of money?" exclaimed Jasper, starting
to his feet, and facing his companion, in the attitude and with the
expression of a man who, finding himself in the presence of an enemy,
assumes the defensive.

"Oh no," was the quiet answer--"not made of money. But, for a
particular friend, you can no doubt, easily raise such a trifle as ten
thousand dollars?"

"Trifle! You mock me, sir!"

"Don't get excited about this matter, Mr. Jasper," coolly returned
Martin, whose name the reader has probably recognised as that of
an agent employed by the merchant and Grind, the lawyer, some years
before, in making investigations relative to the existence of coal on
certain lands not far from Reading, Pennsylvania. "Don't get excited,"
he repeated. "That will do no good. I have not come to rob you. I
don't ask you to give me ten thousand dollars. All I want is a loan,
for which I will pledge good security."

"What kind of security?" asked Jasper quickly.

"Security on my lead-mine."

"Pooh! I wouldn't give the snap of a finger for such security!"

Jasper, thrown off his guard, spoke more contemptuously than was
prudent.

An instant change was visible in Martin, who, rising, commenced
buttoning up his coat. There was about him every mark of a man deeply
offended.

"Good evening, sir!" said he, with a low, formal bow, yet with his
eyes fixed searchingly in those of the merchant.

"Martin,"--Jasper did not smile, nor was there in his voice the
slightest affectation of good feeling--yet his manner and tone were
both decisive,--"Martin, sit down again. Talk in reason, and I will
hear."

The man resumed his seat, and, with his eyes still in those of Jasper,
said--

"I have talked in reason. You are worth, so report says, not less than
three hundred thousand dollars. How the first hundred thousand came,
is known, certainly, only to one man beside you and me. In procuring
that large sum I was a very prominent agent."

"You have already been paid for your services a dozen times over."

"There may be a difference of opinion about this," replied the man
boldly--"and there is a difference of opinion."

"I have already advanced you over five thousand dollars."

"What of that! Five thousand to three hundred thousand that you have
made by the operation."

"You are in error, Martin," said Jasper, with a blended look
of perplexity and distress. "I am not worth the sum you have
mentioned--nothing like it. My losses during the past six months have
been very heavy."

"It is your interest to say this. I can credit as much of it as I
please."

"You are insulting! You presume on the power a knowledge of my affairs
has given you. I will look for a more honourable agent the next time."

"Honourable! Ha! ha!" The visitor laughed in a low, guttural voice.
