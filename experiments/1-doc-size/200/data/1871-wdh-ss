after nightfall, when they are brilliantly lighted from 
within ; and when, if it is a dark, warm night, and 
the briny fragrance comes up strong from the falling 
tide, the lights reflected far down in the still water, 
bring a dream, as I have heard travelled Bostonians 
say, of Venice and her magical effects in the same 
kind. But for me the beauty of the scene needs the 
help of no such association ; I am content with it for 
what it is. I enjoy also the hints of spring which 
one gets in riding over the Long Bridge at low tide 
in the first open days. Then there is not only a 
vernal beating of carpets on the piers of the draw- 
bridge, but the piles and walls left bare by the re- 
ceding water show green patches of sea-weeds and 
mosses, and flatter the willing eye with a dim hint 
of summer. This reeking and saturated herbage, 
— which always seems to me, in contrast with dry- 




land growths, what the water-logged life of seafaring 
folk is to that which we happier men lead on shore, 
— taking so kindly the deceitful warmth and bright- 
ness of the sun, has then a charm which it loses 
when summer really comes ; nor does one, later, have 
so keen an interest in the men wading about in the 
shallows below the bridge, who, as in the distance 
they stoop over to gather whatever shell-fish they 
seek, make a very fair show of being some ungainlier 
sort of storks, and are as near as we can hope to come 
to the spring-prophesying storks of song and story. 
A sentiment of the drowsiness that goes before the 
awakening of the year, and is so different firom the 
drowsiness that precedes the great autumnal slumber, 
is in the air, but is gone when we leave the river 
behind, and strike into the straggling village be- 
yond. 

I maintain that Boston, as one approaches it and 
passingly takes in the line of Bunker Hill Monument, 
soaring preeminent among the emulous foundry- 
chimneys of the sister city, is fine enough to need 
no comparison with other fine sights. Thanks to the 
mansard curves and dormer-windows of the newer 
houses, there is a singularly picturesque variety 
among the roofs that stretch along the bay, and rise 
one above another on the city's three hills, grouping 
themselves about the State House, and surmounted 
by its India-rubber dome. But, after all, does human 
weakness crave some legendary charm, some grace 
of uncertain antiquity, in the picturesqueness it sees ? 
I own that the fiiture, to which we are often re- 



 

ferred for the " stuff that dreams are made of," is 
more difBcult for the fancy than the past, that the 
airy amplitude of its possibilities is somewhat chilly, 
and that we naturally long for the snug quarters of 
old, made warm by many generations of life. Be- 
sides, Em-ope spoils us ingenuous Americans, and 
flatters our sentimentality into ruinous extrava- 
gances. Looking at her many-storied former times, 
we forget our own past, neat, compact, and conven- 
ient for the poorest memory to dwell in. Yet an 
American not infected with the discontent of travel 
could hardly approach this superb city without feel- 
ing something of the coveted pleasure in her, without 
a reverie of her Puritan and Revolutionary times, 
and the great names and deeds of her heroic annals. 
I think, however, we were well to be rid of this 
yearning for a native American antiquity ; for in its 
indulgence one cannot but regard himself and his 
contemporaries as cumberers of the ground, delay- 
ing the consummation of that hoary past which will 
be so fascinating to a semi-Chinese posterity, and 
will be, ages hence, the inspiration of Pigeon-English 
poetry and romance. Let us make much of our two 
hundred and fifty years, and cherish the present as 
our golden age. We healthy-minded people in the 
horse-cars' are loath to lose a moment of it, and are 
aggrieved that the draw of the bridge should be up, 
naturally looking on what is constantly liable to hap- 
pen as an especial malice of the fates. All the dri- 
vers of the vehicles that clog the draw on either side 
have a like sense of personal injury ; and apparently 



 

it would go hard with the captain of that leisurely 
vessel below if he were delivered into our hands. 
But this impatience and anger are entirely illusive. 

We are really the most patient people in the world, 
especially as regards any incorporated, non-pohtical 
oppressions. A lively Gaul, who travelled among us 
some thirty years ago, found that, in the absence of 
political control, we gratified the human instinct of 
obedience by submitting to small tyrannies unknown 
abroad, and were subject to the steamboat-captain, 
the hotel-clerk, the stage-driver, and the waiter, who 
all bullied us fearlessly ; but though some vestiges of 
this bondage remain, it is probably passing away. 
The abusive Frenchman's assertion would not at least 
hold good concerning the horse-car conductors, who, 
in spite of a lingering preference for touching or 
punching passengers for their fare instead of asking 
for it, are commonly mild-mannered and good-tem- 
pered, and disposed to molest us as little as possible. 
I have even received from one of them a mark of 
such kindly familiarity as the offer of a check which 
he held between his lips, and thrust out his face to 
give me, both his hands being otherwise occupied ; 
and their lives are in nowise such luxurious careers 
as we should expect in public despots. The oppres- 
sion of the horse-car passenger is not from them, and 
the passenger himself is finally to blame for it. When 
the draw closes at last, and we rumble forward into 
the city street, a certain stir of expectation is felt 
among us. The long and eventfiil journey is nearly 
ended, and now we who are to get out of the cars 



can philosophically amuse ourselves with the passions 
and sufferings of those who are to return in our 
places. You must choose the time between five and 
six o'clock in the afternoon, if you would make this 
grand study of the national character in its perfec- 
tion. Then the spectacle offered in any arriving 
horse-car will serve your purpose. At nearly every 
corner of the street up which it climbs stands an 
experienced suburban, who darts out upon the car, 
and seizes a vacant place in it. Presently all the 
places are taken, and before we reach Temple Street, 
where helpless groups of women are gathered to 
avail themselves of the first seats vacated, an alert 
citizen is stationed before each passenger who is to 
retire at the summons, "Please pass out forrad." 
When this is heard in Bowdoin Square, we rise and 
push forward, knuckling one another's backs in our 
eagerness, and perhaps glancing behind us at the tu- 
mult within. Not only are all our places occupied, 
but the aisle is left fiill of passengers precariously 
supporting themselves by the straps in the roof. The 
rear platform is stormed and carried by a party with 
bundles; the driver is instantly surrounded by an- 
other detachment ; and as the car moves away from 
the office, the platform steps are filled. 

" Is it possible," I asked myself, when I had 
written as far as this in the present noble history, 
" that I am not exaggerating ? It can't be that this 
and the other enormities I have been describing are 
of daily occurrence in Boston. Let me go verify, 
at least, my picture of the evening horse-car." So 



I take my way to Bowdoin Square, and in the con- 
scientious spirit of modem inquiry, I get aboard the 
first car that comes up. Like every other car, it is 
meant to seat twenty passengers. It does this, and 
besides it carries in the aisle and on the platform 
forty passengers standing. The air is what you may 
imagine, if you know that not only is the place so 
indecently crowded, but that in the centre of the car 
are two adopted citizens, far gone in drink, who have 
the aspect and the smell of having passed the day in 
an ash-heap. These citizens being quite helpless 
themselves, are supported by the public, and repose 
in singular comfort upon all the passengers near 
them; I, myself, contribute an aching back to the 
common charity, and a genteelly dressed young lady 
takes one of them from time to time on her knee. But 
they are comparatively an ornament to society till the 
conductor objects to the amount they offer him for 
fere ; for after that they wish to fight him during the 
journey, and invite him at short intervals to step out 
and be shown what manner of men they are. The 
conductor passes it off for a joke, and so it is, and a 
very good one. 

In that unhappy mass it would be an audacious 
spirit who should say of any particular arm or leg, 
" It is mine," and all the breath is in common. 
Nothing, it would seem, could add to our misery; 
but we discover our error when the conductor 
squeezes a tortuous path through us, and collects the 
money for our transportation. I never can tell, dur-
