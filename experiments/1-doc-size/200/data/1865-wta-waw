Bertha. I'm not half so much to blame as you think I am; but I set the
fire, and they are after me for it. They have used all sorts of tricks
to catch me; but I'm not going into any court-house, or any tinker's
shop."

"What tricks do you mean?"

"They said they had a lot of money for me, and that Squire Wriggs
wouldn't do me any harm."

"Well, I don't know anything about that. Father went over to Whitestone
with Squire Wriggs, after you ran away. He went over again last night,
after he came from the city, and I haven't seen him for more than a
moment since."

"He is going to send me to the court-house," said Noddy, fully satisfied
that Bertha knew nothing about the proceedings of her father. "I am
going to sea, now."

"To sea, Noddy?"

"Yes, I'm going to work and win, as you told me, and when I come back I
shall be respectable."

Bertha had her doubts on this point. She had almost lost all hope of her
protégé, and she did not think that a voyage in the forecastle of a
ship would be likely to improve his manners or his morals.

"I can't let you go, Noddy," said she.

"I must go; if I stay here they will put me in prison. You don't want to
see me put in prison, Bertha."

"I don't."

"Then what can I do? The officers are after me this moment."

"But I shall have to tell my father that I have seen you."

"You may do that; and you may tell him, too, that it won't be any use
for him to try to find me, for I shall keep out of the way. If they
catch me they will be smarter than I am," added Noddy, confidently.

"I want to see you again, Noddy, after I have talked with father about
you. I don't believe he intends to send you to prison."

"I know he does. I come over here to see you before I went away. I
couldn't go without seeing you, or I shouldn't have come. I may never
see you again, for I shan't run any more risks after this."

Bertha said all she could to induce him to meet her again; but the
cunning youth was afraid that some trap might be set to catch him, and
he assured her that this was positively his last appearance at Woodville
for the present. He was satisfied that Mr. Grant had taken the case into
his own hands, and that she could not save him if she would.

"Now, good-bye, Miss Bertha," said he, wiping a tear from his face.

"Don't go, Noddy," pleaded she.

"I must."

"You haven't any clothes but those you have on, and you have no money."

"I don't want any. I can get along very well. Won't you shake hands with
me before I go?"

"Certainly, I will," replied she, giving him her hand. "You will not let
me do anything for you now?"

"You have done more than I deserve. Good-bye, Miss Bertha," said he,
pressing the hand he held.

"Good-bye, Noddy," replied she. "Good-bye, if you must go."

"There comes your father," exclaimed he, as he bounded off into the
grove with the speed of an antelope.

"Was that Noddy?" asked Mr. Grant, as he joined Bertha a few minutes
later.

"Yes, father."

"Why didn't you tell me he was here, Bertha?"

"He came but a few moments ago. He came to bid me good-bye."

"Where is he going?"

"He is going to sea. He says you intend to take him to the court-house."

"This is very unfortunate. A most remarkable event in regard to the boy
has occurred, which I haven't time to tell you about now. It is very
important that I should find him at once."

"I don't think you can catch him. He is very much afraid of being sent
to prison."

"I had no intention of sending him to prison," laughed Mr. Grant.

"But he heard Squire Wriggs say he must take him over to the court."

"That was for another matter--in a word, to have a guardian appointed,
for Noddy will be a rich man when he is of age."

"Noddy?" exclaimed Bertha.

"Yes; but I haven't a moment to spare. I have been at work on his
affairs since yesterday morning. They are all right now; and all we want
to enable us to complete the business is the presence of the boy."

"Poor fellow! He is terribly worked up at the idea of going to the
court-house, or even to a tinker's shop, as he calls it."

"Well, he is running away from his own fortune and happiness; and I must
find him."

"I hope you will, father," said Bertha, earnestly, as Mr. Grant hastened
away to organize a pursuit of the refugee.

All the male servants on the place were summoned, and several started
off in the direction in which Noddy had retreated. The boatman and
others were sent off in the boats; and the prospect was, that the
fugitive would be captured within a few hours. As our story relates more
especially to the runaway himself, we shall follow him, and leave the
well-meaning people of Woodville to pursue their investigations alone.

When Noddy discovered Mr. Grant, he was satisfied that the gentleman saw
him, for he quickened his pace, and walked towards the place where he
stood holding Bertha's hand. He ran with all his might by the familiar
paths till he reached the Glen. There were, at present, no signs of a
pursuit; but he was confident that it would not be delayed, and he did
not even stop to take breath. Rushing down to the water, he embarked in
the skiff, and rowed up the river, taking care to keep in shore, where
he could not be seen from below.

Above Van Alstine's Island, he crossed the river, and began to work his
way down; but the white sails of the Greyhound were seen, with all the
boats belonging to the estate, headed up stream. They were chasing him
in earnest, and he saw that it was not safe to remain on the river.

"Do you know where Mr. Grover lives?" he asked of a ragged boy who was
fishing on the bank of the river.

"Below Whitestone?"

"Yes."

"Will you take this boat down there?"

"I will," replied the boy, glad of the job, and willing to do it without
any compensation.

Noddy had taken off the tights belonging to the circus company, and
rolled them up in a bundle. In order to be as honest as Bertha had
taught him to be,--though he was not always so particular,--he engaged
the boy to leave them at the circus tent.

The boy got into the boat, and began his trip down the river. Noddy felt
that he had been honest, and he was rather proud of the record he was to
leave behind him; for it did not once occur to him that borrowing the
boat without leave was only a little better than stealing it, even if he
did return it.

The servants at Woodville and the constables at Whitestone were on his
track, and he had no time to spare. Taking a road leading from the
river, he walked away from it as fast as he could. About three miles
distant, he found a road leading to the northward; and thinking it
better to suffer by excess of prudence than by the want of it, he took
this direction, and pursued his journey till he was so tired he could go
no farther.

A farmer on the road gave him some dinner; and when he had rested
himself, he resumed his walk. At sunset he reached a large town on the
river, where he felt safe from pursuit until he saw the flaming
hand-bills of the Great Olympian Circus, which was almost as bad as
meeting one of the constables, for these worthies would expect to find
him at the tent, and probably were on the watch for him.

Noddy was too tired to walk any farther that day. He wanted to reach
some large seaport, like New York or Boston, where he could find a
vessel bound on a foreign voyage. He was almost afraid to go to the
former city, for he had heard about the smart detectives they have
there, who catch any person guilty of crime, though they never saw him
before. He had told Bertha that he intended to go to sea; and he was
afraid that Mr. Grant would be on the watch for him, or set some of
these detectives to catch him, if he went there.

It was almost time for the steamers for Albany, which went up in the
night, to reach the town, and he determined to go on board of one, and
proceed as far up the river as he could with the small sum of money in
his possession. He soon found the landing-place, and presently a steamer
came along.

"Where do you want to go, boy?" asked one of the officers of the boat.

"I want to go to Albany; but I haven't money enough to pay my fare."

"How much money have you got?"
