"I'll let you know who I am," was the swaggering reply.

Though he was but one man opposed to two, he had no fears. The farmer
was evidently cowed and terrified, while the Quaker seemed, though
large, to be peaceable and harmless.

But in his judgment of Luke the outlaw was very much at fault. When
threatening the farmer he had covered him with his revolver, but as he
was preparing to leave the buggy he carelessly lowered it. Luke, who
was aching to attack him, noticed this.

While Fox, for it was one of the notorious brothers, was standing in
careless security the Quaker sprang upon him like a panther upon his
prey. He knocked the revolver from his hand with one powerful blow,
felled him to the ground, and placed his foot upon his prostrate form.

Never, perhaps, in a career crowded with exciting adventures had the
outlaw been so thoroughly surprised.

"What the mischief does this mean?" he ejaculated, struggling to rise.

"It means that thee has mistaken thy man," answered Luke coolly.

"Let me go or I'll kill you!" shrieked the outlaw fiercely.

"If you try to get up I'll put a bullet through your head," replied
Luke, pointing at him with his own revolver.

In his excitement he had dropped his Quaker speech, and this the
outlaw noted.

"Are you a Quaker? he asked abruptly.

"No more than you are," answered Luke. "Farmer, bring out the rope."

Ezekiel Mason, from the bottom of the buggy, produced a long and stout
piece of clothes-line.

"What do you mean to do?" inquired the outlaw uneasily.

"You will see soon enough. No, don't try to get up, as you value your
life. Now tie him, Mason, while I keep him covered with the revolver."

[Illustration: "Now tie him, Mason, while I keep him covered with the

"We've had enough of this," said the outlaw sullenly. "Let me go, and
I'll do you no harm."

"I don't mean that you shall, my honest friend."

"But if you persist in this outrage, I swear that you will be a dead
man within thirty days."

"Be careful how you talk, or you may be a dead man within thirty
minutes," answered Luke.

While the outlaw was covered by Luke's revolver, farmer Mason, though
his tremulous hands showed that he was nervous, managed to tie him
securely. Fox began to under stand the sort of man with whom he was
dealing and remained silent, but his brain was busy trying to devise
some method of escape.

At length the dangerous prisoner was securely tied.

"What shall we do with him?" asked Ezekiel.

"Where's the nearest prison?

"At Crampton."

"How far away?"

"Twelve miles."

"In what direction?"

"It is four miles beyond Claremont," answered the farmer.

"Where you live?"

"Yes."

"Then we will go there first."

"But how shall we carry this gentleman?" asked the farmer, who could
not get over a feeling of deference for the celebrated outlaw.

[Illustration: "NOW TIE HIM, MASON, WHILE I KEEP HIM COVERED WITH THE
REVOLVER."]

"We'll put him into the back part of the buggy."

By the united efforts of both, the outlaw, like a trussed fowl, was
deposited bodily in the rear of the carriage, where he lay in a most
uncomfortable position, jolted and shaken whenever the road was rough
or uneven. It was a humiliating position, and he felt it.

"You'll repent this outrage," he said fiercely.

"Doesn't thee like it?" asked Luke, relapsing into his Quaker dialect.

"Curse you and your Quaker lingo!" retorted Fox, his black eyes
sparkling vindictively.

"It wouldn't do thee any harm to turn Quaker thyself," suggested Luke.

"I'll be bruised to death before the ride is over," growled the
outlaw.

"There is one way of saving you the discomfort of the ride."

"What is that?"

"I might shoot you through the head. As the reward is the same whether
I deliver you alive or dead, I have almost determined to do it."

The outlaw was made still more uncomfortable by these words. He had
wholly misunderstood Luke at first, and the revelation of his real
character had impressed him not only with respect, but with fear. He
did not know of what this pseudo Quaker might be capable. He longed in
some way to get out of his power. Force was impracticable, and he
resolved to resort to finesse.

"Look here, my friend," he began.

"So you regard me as a friend? Thank you, brother Fox; I won't forget
it."

"Oh, bother your nonsense! I suppose you are after the thousand
dollars offered for my apprehension."

"You have guessed right the first time. I am not a rich man, and I
don't mind telling you that a thousand dollars will be particularly
acceptable just about now."

"So I supposed. You don't feel particularly unfriendly to me?"

"Oh, no. I might under different circumstances come to love you like a
brother."

"Or join my band?"

"Well, no; I draw the line there. As a Quaker I could not consistently
join a band of robbers."

"Who are you?" asked Fox abruptly. "You weren't raised around here."

"No."

"Where, then?"

"I come from Iowa."

"What is your name?"

"My friend, I haven't any visiting cards with me. You can think of me
as the Quaker detective."

"Then I will come to business. You want a thousand dollars?"

"You are correct there."

"Then I will show you a way to get it."

"I know one way already."

"You mean by delivering me up?"

"Yes."

"That would not suit me. Let me go, and I will give you a thousand
dollars."

"Have you got it with you?"

"No, but I can arrange to give it to you within a week. You see,"
added the outlaw dryly, "I have been prosperous in my business, and
can snare that sum in return for the favor you are going to do me in
giving me my liberty."

"I am afraid, friend Fox, that my chance of securing the money in that
way would be very slender."

"I am a man of my word. What I promise, that I will do."

"If you have so much money, why did you want to take the five hundred
dollars of my friend here?"

"It was all in the way of business. Well, what do you say?"

"That I won't trust you. If I should take your thousand dollars for
releasing you I should be as bad as you are."

"Very well; drive on, then," said the outlaw sullenly.

In less than an hour Ezekiel Mason's home was reached. When they drove
into the yard it made quite a sensation. Mrs. Mason and the hired man
stood staring at them with mouths agape.
