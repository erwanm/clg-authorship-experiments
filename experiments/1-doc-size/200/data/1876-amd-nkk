"Nelly," began her mother presently with a sympa 
thetic smile, ' ' perhaps your mission-work is from within. 
All are not called to go into the highways, or even the 
temples. There are wayside shrines in many lowly 
valleys. And, as in the creation, to every work there is- 
its appointed day." 

' ' I wonder if I am a little impatient ? But, if I felt 
that I was doing ever so small a work, I should be more 
content. Really, mamma, I feel afraid of my tempta 
tion to idleness and listlessness. I realize the truth of 
the adage, that ' labor is worship.' ' 

" And that home is the central pivot. It is one of 
the misfortunes, Nelly, that your life should be taken on 
such terms : so you must look to other duties to counter- 



 

balance it. The difficulties were there when you took 
it." 

"Yes: I cannot plead being deceived in any point. 
But neither does it seem right to give up idly, to fritter 
away my days in uselessness." 

" It is not right. Human life is too short." 

" Then I must find some way out, and some duties. 
O mamma ! how' did you make your life so rich and full 
and outflowing? " 

" It was not so all at once, Nelly. And then I had 
papa to counsel me." 

Papa, who was then twenty-eight. Ah ! it was not the 
years alone, but something finer and deeper in the man ; 
and Nelly Kinnard had seen glimpses of it in her 
husband, long before he had become that to her. How 
did one get at all. these deep and hidden things? the 
precious stones on which every true soul builds its way up ; 
for shifting sand never yet reared a stable character. 
She understood, then, the long years of study that were 
needed, the undoing of some other persons' work, just as 
it had been teaching Gerty to sew. It would have been 
so much easier to do it the first time herself ; but there 
was given us in this world a good deal of second-hand 
work to do ; with crumpled and frayed edges, and puckered 
seams. And, in gardens, how many weeds come up to 
one flower ! 

Then papa sauntered in, and looked at his darling with 
an odd, wistful expression, as if he was not sure how much 
belonged to him any more. She must see some new books 
in the study, and some new flowers in the garden ; and 
there was the girls' room to inspect, with its pretty new 
carpet, and the picture that Fan had painted for the birth 
day of Queen Bess, as they had taken to calling her since 
she had shot up into such a tall, elegant-looking girl. 

Then there was dinner, and, after that, Fan and the 
babies. And Nelly drove down to the station in the 





Churchill carriage for her husband, who sat and studied 
her curiously all the way back. 

He was in a very bright, jolly mood, and would fain 
have taken some of the numerous sisters home with them ; 
but mamma was to have the honor of a first visit. 

"If you like, Nelly, I'll ask Henderson to exchange 
with me ; and then we can spend Sunday," said her fa 
ther. 

' ' Excellent ! " returned Dr. Kinnard with a cordial 
shake of the hand. 

Then he placed his wife in the corner of the seat by the 
open window, and seated himself beside her. 

" Are you sorry?" he asked. 

" Sorry for what?" 

" That you are leaving the Delectable Mountains be 
hind ; " and a half-smile crossed his face. 

" But the Delectable Mountains were not the last, nor 
the best thing in the journey." 

" I am glad you think so, very glad ; " and he gave her 
hand a fond pressure. 

And Nelly Kinnard realized more deeply than ever, 
as they entered the quiet house together that evening, 
the magnitude of her work here, to make a home, a 
woman's duty and province : it had never been a home 
yet. She was not to have the sweet and tender assistance 
that had been vouchsafed to both Rose and Fan. When 
there was peace in the house, Dr. Kinnard did not want 
it disturbed. So long as squabbles were kept out of his 
sight and hearing, the rest of the family might indulge 
in them twenty times a day. The little time he was in 
the house, he insisted upon having peace; and.it had 
been every one's desire to stand well with him. In fact, 
the three women of his household had each adored him 
in her way, his mother, because he was her only son, 
and had been, in the earlier part of his life, very man 
ageable. Aunt Adelaide honored him, secretly, for his 



 

patience with her sister ; then he had the sort of half-im- 
periousness that sways women irresistibly. Perhaps, too, 
she had allowed herself to care as much for him as a 
woman of her temperament could care for a man before 
marriage ; and that he should be foolish enough to choose 
a young thing of twenty, so liberally endowed with girlish 
prettiness, was another affront. Jane tyrannized over him 
in some respects, and was his slave in others. Every thing 
that could minister to his appetite was liberally provided. 
Meals at any time were no trouble, if they were for him ; 
but she would hardly go out of her way for another mem 
ber of the household. 

Great had been the consternation when the proposed 
marriage was known to be a certainty. 

" New wives make new laws," Mrs. Kinnard had said 
to her son. " I suppose, in my old age, 'I must seek 
another home. I did hope, Barton, never to have to 
separate from }^ou again. If it had only been Adelaide, 
we could have gone right along, without any change. But 
a young girl? like Miss Endicott, will want her 
own friends and pleasures ; and old people must be pushed 
aside." 

"What nonsense, mother! This is to be your home 
as long as you care to stay in it, which I hope will be 
always. I don't see why two or three women in a house 
cannot agree." 

' ' I am sure I should like to stay here while I live ; and 
T sometimes feel that will not be very long. Our people 
are healthy while they do live ; but none of them have 
reached old age ; " and Mrs. Kinnard wiped her eyes 
pathetically. 

He hated to see a woman cry : so he comforted her, and 
assured her that she would soon learn to love Nelly 
Endicott like a daughter. 

Which might not have been so difficult a thing, after 
all, if Aunt Adelaide had not been there. The ready 





affection of Nelly Endicott would have thrown out some 
irresistible tendril ; for, at heart, she was not an unkind 
woman : but her son, certainly, had not inherited his self- 
reliance and sturdy independence from her. She had, 
too, a fatal facility of believing and mistrusting the worst ; 
and her fears had been easily- swayed by Miss Grove's 
strong and rigid mind. 

" I consider it my duty to stay and look after these 
motherless children, who will have no real friend now but 
me. I have seen too often the influence a second wife 
gains over a man. She can persuade him into any line 
of conduct respecting his children. ' Second mothers are 
invariably jealous and envious unless, as it sometimes 
happens, they are a connection of the first." 

"If he had only married you, Adelaide!" groaned 
Mrs. Kinnard. 

" I have no necessity for marrying any man," returned 
Miss Grove in her loftiest, tone. " Miss Endicott, of 
course, feels differently. There are a host of girls ; and 
their mother, no doubt, understands the art of getting 
them off her hands. Not that I blame the poor woman. 
Girls with no means of their own have no resource but 
marriage ; while a woman who has an assured income 
can afford to be independent. My sister and I enjoyed 
this exceedingly, I do not understand how any woman 
can endure the thought of marrying a man for a mere 
support." 

" And I daresay she is idle and extravagant," went
