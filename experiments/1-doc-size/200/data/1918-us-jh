through other men's back yards. For once people heard him 
without threats of lynching. 

So on through this night of anguish. Jimmie lost old man 
Drew in the darkness, and was all alone when the dawn came, 
and he could see the sweep of desolation about him, and the 
awe-stricken faces of the spectators. Soon afterwards came the 
climax. He saw a crowd gathered, and as he came up, this 
crowd parted for him. Nobody seemed to want to speak, but 
they all watched, as if curious to see what he would do. One 
of the men bore a burden, wrapped in a horse-blanket; Jimmie 
gazed, and after a moment's hesitation the man threw back 
part of the blanket, and there before Jimmie's eyes was a most 
horrible sight a human leg, a large white leg, the lower half 
covered with a black stocking tied at the top with a bit of 
tape. It was such a leg as you see in the windows of stores 
where they sell pretty things for ladies; only this leg was soft, 
mangled at the top, smeared with blood, and partly charred 
black. One glance was enough for Jimmie, and he put his 
hands over his eyes and turned and ran out to the road and 
away, away anywhere from this place of nightmares ! 



VII 

Jimmie's whole world was wiped out, ended. He had no 
place to go, no care what became of him. He stumbled on 





till he came to the trolley-track, and got on the first car which 
came along. It was pure chance that it happened to be going 
back to Leesville, for Jimmie had no longer any interest in 
that city. When the car came to the barn, he got out and 
wandered aimlessly, until he happened to pass a saloon where 
he had been accustomed to meet Jerry 'Coleman, distributor of 
ten dollar bills. Jimmie went in and ordered a drink of 
whiskey; he did not tell the saloon-keeper what had happened, 
but took the drink to a table and sat down by himself. When 
he had finished, he ordered another, because it helped him not 
to think ; he sat there at the table, drinking steadily for an hour 
or more. And so upon his confused mind there dawned a 
strange, a ghastly idea, climax of all that night of horror. 
Which leg of Lizzie was it the man had been carrying wrapped 
in a horse-blanket? The right leg or the left? If it was the 
left leg, why, nothing; but if it was the right, why then, under 
the stocking was sewed a bandage, and in that bandage was 
wrapped a package containing seven faded yellow twenty dollar 
bills! 

And what would they do about it? Would they bury the 
leg without investigation ? Or would the man who had found 
it happen to undress it? And what was Jimmie to do? A 
hundred and forty dollars was not to be sneezed at by a work- 
ing-man it was more money than he had ever had in his life 
before, or might ever have again. But could he go to the 
man and say, "Did you find any money on my wife's leg?" 
Could he say, "Please give me my wife's leg, so that I can 
undress it and unsew the bandage, and get the money that I was 
paid for keeping quiet about the surgical operation on Lacey 
Granitch, that was done in my house before it was blown to 
pieces by the explosion." 

Jimmie thought it all over while he took a couple more 
drinks, and finally settled it to himself : "Aw hell ! What do I 
want with money? I ain't a-goin' to live no more !" 






TMMIE HIGGINS was wandering down the street, when he 
 ran into "Wild Bill," who was, of course, greatly surprised 
to see his friend in a drunken condition. When he heard the 
reason, he revealed an unexpected side of his nature. If you 
judged "Wild Bill" by his oratory, you thought him a creature 
poisoned through and through, a soul turned rancid with envy, 
hatred and malice and all uncharitableness. But now the tears 
came into his eyes, and he put his arm over Jimmie's shoulder. 
"Say, old pal, that's bum luck! By God, I'm sorry!" And 
Jimmie, who wanted nothing so much as somebody to be sorry 
with, clasped Bill in his arms, and burst into tears, and told 
over and over again how he had gone to what had been his 
home, and found only a huge crater blown out by the explosion, 
and how he had gone about calling his wife and babies, until 
at last they had brought him one leg of his wife. 

"Wild Bill" listened, until he knew the story through, and 
then he said, "See here, old pal, let's you and me quit this 
town." 

"Quit?" said Jimmie, stupidly. 

"Every time I open the front of my face now, the police 
jump in it. Leesville's a hell of a town, I say. Let's get out." 

"Where'll we go?" 

"Anywhere what's the diff? It's coming summer. Let's 
slam the gates." 

Jimmie was willing why not? They went back to the 
lodging-house where Bill lived, and he tied up his worldly 
goods in a gunny-sack the greater part of the load consisting 
of a diary in which he had recorded his adventures as leader 
of an unemployed army which had started to march from Cali- 
fornia to Washington, D. C., some four years previously. They 



took the trolley, and getting off in the country, walked along the 
banks of the river, Jimmie still sobbing, and Bill in the grip of 
one of his fearful coughing spells. They sat down beside the 
stream, not so far from where Jimmie had gone in swimming 
with the Candidate; he gave a touching account of this adven- 
ture, but fell asleep in the middle of it, and Bill wandered off 
and begged some food at a farm-house, using his cough as a 
convenient lever for moving the heart of the house-wife. When 
night came, they sought the railroad and got on board a south- 
ward-moving freight ; so Jimmie Higgins went back to the hobo 
life, at which he had spent a considerable part of his youth. 

But there was a difference now; he was no longer a blind 
and helpless victim of a false economic system, but a revolution- 
ist, fully class-conscious, trained in a grim school. The country 
was going to war, and Jimmie was going to war on the country. 
The two agitators got off the train at a mining-village, and 
got a job as "surface-men," and proceeded to preach their gospel 
of revolt to the workers in a lousy company boarding-house. 
When they were found out, they "jumped" another freight, and 
repeated the performance in another part of the district. 

The companies were too vigilant for there to be any chance 
of a strike; but "Wild Bill" whispered to the young workers 
that he knew a trick worth two of that he would teach them 
the art of "striking on the job" ! This idea of course had great 
charm for embittered men ; enabling them to pay back the boss, 
while at the same time continuing on his pay-roll. Bill had 
read whole books in which the theory and practice of "sabotage" 
were worked out, and he could tell any sort of workman tricks 
to make his employer sweat under the collar. If you worked 
in a machine-shop, you dropped emery-powder into the bear- 
ings; if you worked on a farm, you drove copper nails into the 
fruit-trees, which caused them to die; if you packed apples, you 
stuck your thumb-nail into one, which made sure that the whole 
box would be rotten when it arrived ; if you worked in a saw-mill, 
you drove a spike into a log ; if you worked in a restaurant, you 
served double portions to ruin the boss, and spit in each por- 
tion, to make sure the customer did not derive any benefit. 
All these things you did in a fervour of exaltation, a mood of 
frenzied martyrdom, because of the blaze of hate which had been 
fanned in your soul by a social system based upon oppression 
and knavery. 



 



II 

To Jimmie, living the obscure and comparatively peaceful 
life of a Socialist propagandist, the question of "sabotage, vio- 
lence and crime'' had been a more or less academic one, about 
which the comrades debated acrimoniously, and against which 
they voted by a large majority. But now Jimmie was out among 
the "wobblies," the "blanket-stiffs" the unskilled workers who 
had literally nothing but their muscle-power to sell; here he 
was in the front-line trenches of the class war. These men 
wandered about from one job to another, at the mercy of the 
seasons and the fluctuations of industry. They were deprived 
of votes, and therefore of their status as citizens; they were de- 
prived of a chance to organise, and therefore of their status as 
human beings. They were lodged in filthy bunk-houses, fed 
upon rotten food, and beaten or jailed at the least word of 
revolt. So they fought their oppressors with any and every 
weapon they could lay hands on. 

In the turpentine-country, in a forest, Jimmie and his pal 
came to a "jungle' a place where the "wobblies" congregated, 
living off the country. Here around the camp-fires Jimmie met 
the guerrillas of the class-struggle, and learned the songs of 
revolt which they sang some of them parodies on Christian 
hymns which would have caused the orthodox and respectable 
to faint with horror. Here they rested up, and exchanged data 
on the progress of their fight, and argued over tactics, and 
cussed the Socialists and the other "politicians" and "labour- 
fakirs," and sang the praises of the "one big union' and the 
"mass strike' and "direct action" against the masters of indus- 
try. They told stories of their sufferings and their exploits, and 
Jimmie sat and listened. Sometimes his eyes were wide with 
consternation, for he had never met men so desperate as these. 

For example, "Strawberry" Curran named for his red hair 
and innumerable freckles an Irish boy with the face of a choir-
