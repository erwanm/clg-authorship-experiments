suggested that this might be because he had a wife and six 
children; but the other was too much absorbed in his tirade to 
notice Jimmie's grin. He blustered on, in a tone so loud that 
several times people on the street overheard, and gave him a 
black look. Jimmie, being less in the mood of martyrdom, 
parted from him and went to see the Meissners. 

The little bottle-packer was living in the same place, having 
rented the upper part of his house to a Polish family to help 
meet his constantly rising expenses. He welcomed Jimmie with 
open arms patted him on the back with delight, and opened 
a bottle of beer to treat him. He asked a hundred questions 
about Jimmie's adventures, and told in turn about events in 
Leesville. The local as a whole had stood firm against the war, 



and was still carrying on propaganda, in the face of ferocious 
opposition. The working classes were pumped so full of "patri- 
otic dope.' you could hardly get them to listen; as for the 
radicals, they were marked men their mail was intercepted, 
their meetings attended by almost as many detectives as spec- 
tators. A number had been drafted which Meissner con- 
sidered deliberate conspiracy on the part of the draft-boards. 

Who had been taken? Jimmie asked. The other answered: 

Comrade Claudel, the jeweller he wanted to go, of course; 

and Comrade Koeln, the glass-blower he was a German, but 

 had been naturalised, so they had taken him, in spite of his 

protests; and Comrade Stankewitz 

"Stankewitz !" cried Jimmie, in dismay. 

"Sure, he's gone." 

"Was he willing?" 

"They didn't ask if he was willing. They just told him to 
report.' " 

Somehow that seemed to bring the war nearer to Jimmie's 
consciousness than anything that had happened so far. The 
little Roumanian Jew had given him the greater part of his 
education on this world-conflict; it was over the counter of the 
cigar-store that Jimmie had got the first geography lessons of his 
life. He had learned that Russia was the yellow country, and 
Germany the green, and Belgium the pale blue, and France the 
light pink ; he had seen how the railroads from the green to the 
pink ran through the pale blue, and how the big fortresses in the 
pale blue all faced towards the green something which Meis- 
sner and Schneider and the rest of the green people considered a 
mortal affront, a confession of guilt on the part of the pale blue 
people. Comrade Stakewitz's wizened up, eager little face rose 
before Jimmie; he heard the shrill voice, trying to compose the 
disputes in the local. "Comrades, all this vill not get us any- 
vere ! There is but vun question ve have to answer, are ve inter- 
nationalists, or are ve not !" 

"My God!" cried Jimmie. "Ain't that awful?" 

He had got to the point where he was willing to admit that 
perhaps the Kaiser had got to be licked, and maybe it was all 
right for a fellow that felt like Emil Forster to go and lick 
him. But to lay hold of a man who hated war with all his heart 
and soul, to drag him away from the little business he had 
painfully built up, and compel him to put on a uniform and 



 

obey other men's orders well, when you saw a thing like that, 
you knew about the atrocities of war! 





Comrade Meissner went on. Worse than that they had 
taken Comrade Gerrity. And Jimmie stared. "But he's mar- 
ried!" 

"I know," explained Meissner, "but that ain't what counts. 
What you got to have is a dependent wife. An' the Gerritys 
didn't know that Comrade Evelyn held on to her job as 
stenographer, and somebody must have told on them, for the 
board jacked him up, and cancelled his exemption. Of course, 
it was only because he was organiser of the local; they want to 
put us out of business any way they can." 

"What did Gerrity do?" 

"He refused to serve, and they sent a squad of men after 
him and dragged him away. They took him to Camp Sheridan, 
and tried to put him in uniform, and he refused he wouldn't 
work, he wouldn't have anything to do with war. So they tried 
him and sentenced him to twenty-five years in jail ; they put him 
in solitary confinement, and he gets nothin' but bread and 
water they keep him chained up by his wrists a part of the 



"Oh! OUT cried Jimmie. 

"Comrade Evelyn's most crazy about it. She broke down 
and cried in the local, and she went around to the churches 
they have women's sewing-circles, you know, and things for the 
Red Cross, and her and Comrade Mary Allen gets up and 
makes speeches an' drives the women crazy. They arrested 'em 
once, but they turned 'em loose they didn't want it to get in 
the papers." 

Comrade Meissner could not have foreseen how this par- 
ticular news would affect Jimmie ; Meissner knew nothing about 
the strange adventure which had befallen his friend, the ama- 
tory convulsion which had shaken his soul. Before Jimmie's 
mind now rose the lovely face with the pert little dimples and 
the halo of fluffy brown hair; the thought of Comrade Evelyn 
Baskerville in distress was simply not to be endured. "Where 
is she?" he cried. He had a vision of himself rushing forth- 
with to take up the agitation; to raid the church sewing-circles 





and brave the wrath of the she-patriots; to go to jail with 
Comrade Evelyn; or perhaps who could say? to put about 
her, gently and reverently, a pair of fraternal and comforting 
arms. 

Jimmie had the temperament of the dreamer, the idealist, to 
whom it is enough to want a thing to see that thing forthwith 
coming into being. His imagination, stimulated by the image 
of the charming stenographer, rushed forth on the wildest of 
flights. He realised for the first time that he was a free man ; 
while, as for Comrade Evelyn, suppose the worst were to happen, 
suppose Comrade Grerrity were to perish of the diet of bread 
and water, or to be dragged into the trenches and killed 
then the sorrowing widow would be in need of some one to 
uphold her, to put fraternal and comforting arms about her 

"Where is she?" Jimmie asked again; and Comrade Meis- 
sner dissipated his dream by replying that she had gone off to 
work for an organisation in New York which was agitating 
for humane treatment for "conscientious objectors." Meissner 
hunted up the pamphlet published by this organisation, telling 
most hideous stories of the abusing of such victims of the mili- 
tary frenzy; they had been beaten, tortured and starved, sub- 
jected to ridicule and humiliation, in many cases dragged 
before courts-martial and sentenced to imprisonment for twenty 
or thirty years. Jimmie sat up a part of the night reading 
these stories with the result that once more the feeble sprout 
of patriotism was squashed flat in his soul! 





Jimmie went to the next meeting of the local. It was a 
slender affair now, for some of the members were in jail, and 
some in the training-camps, and some afraid to come for fear of 
their jobs, and some discouraged by incessant persecution. But 
the old war-horses were there Comrade Schneider, and gentle 
old Hermann Forster, and Comrade Mabel Smith, with an 
account of her brother's mistreatment in the county jail, and 
Comrade Mary Allen, the Quaker lady. This last was still tak- 
ing it as a personal affront that America should be going into 
the bloody mess, in spite of all her denunciations and protests; 
she was even paler and thinner than when Jimmie had seen her 
last her hands trembled and her thin lips quivered as she 



 

spoke, you could see that she was burning up with excitement 
over the monstrous wickedness of the world's events. She read 
to the local a harrowing story of a boy who had registered as 
a conscientous objector in New York, and had been taken 
out to a training-camp and subjected to such indignities that 
he had shot himself. Comrade Mary had no children of her 
own, so she had adopted these conscientious objectors, and as 
she read of their experiences, her soul was convulsed with a 
mingling of grief and rage. 

Jimmie went back to the Empire Shops and applied for a 
job. They needed thousands of men, so the "Herald" declared 
but they did not need a single one like Jimmie ! The man 
to whom he applied recognised him at once, and said, "Nothin' 
doin'." For the sake of being nasty, Jimmie went to the head- 
quarters of the newly formed union, and asked them to force 
old Abel Granitch to give him work, according to the terms of 
the agreement with the government. But the union secretary, 
after thinking the matter over, decided that the provision against 
blacklisting applied only to men who had been out on the last
