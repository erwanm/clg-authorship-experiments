Merrimack, the sea when he caught a glimpse of 
it, the dam at Lawrence, and the Lowell bells, 
and the wind that sprang up in an afternoon, and 
gray clouds, and red sunsets, and the cattle on 
the road, especially, he said, to trees ; but always 
rather to these things than to a human hearer. 

" They listened to me," he said, turning shrewd 
eyes and a foolish smile upon his visitor. " They 
always listen to me. It 's a free country and I 'm 
a troublesome character, but they listen — they 
listen. It 's a free country and there 's room for 
them and me. I 'm an old man to be turned out 
o' work. One night I sat down on Lawrence 
Bridge and said'so. It was coming dark, and all 
the little trees were green. No, marm, I 'm not 
out o' my head. I 'm only a troublesome 
character out of work in a free country. The mill- 
gals they went by, but I 'd rather tell the little 
trees. I hadn't eat no dinner nor no supper. It 
was dark ag'in the water and ag'in the sky ; all 
the lights in the mills was blazin', and the streets 
was full ; if I 'd been a younger man I 'd not have 
took it quite so hard, mebbe. A younger man 
might set his hand to this and that ; but I've 
worked to factories fifty-six years, and I was very 





old to get my notice unexpected. I 'm sixty-six 
years old. 

" ' We know you,' says they to me, ' we don't 
want you ! ' says they. Here and there, up to 
New Hampshyre and back ag'in, this place and 
that and t'other, ' We know you,' says they. 

" So I set on Lawrence Bridge ; there was cars 
and ingines come screechin' by ; ' We know you,' 
says they ; and the little trees held up like as 
it was their hands to listen. ' They know me,' 
says I, ' I 'm a troublesome character out o' work ! ' 
There was a little Irish gal come by that night 
and took me home to supper. She lived in one 
o' them new little houses adown the road. 

" There, there, there ! Well, well, it 's oncom- 
mon strange how much more cheery-like it is a 
talkin' to women-folks than it is to trees. And 
clearin' to the head. But you 'd never guess, 
unless you was a troublesome character and out 
of work; how them trees would listen — 

" I like the looks of you setting up ag'in the 
chair ; it makes a variety about the wall. You 'd 
never know, onless you 'd come to the end on 't, 
how little of what you may call variety there is 
about that wall. 


" Now I remember what I had to say ; I remem- 
ber clear. I think I 've had a fever-turn about 
me, and a man gets muddled now and then from 
talking to so many trees and furrests. There 's 
a sameness about it. They 're good listeners, 
but there 's a sameness about 'em ; and a lone- 
someness. 

" Now this is what I had to say ; in the name of 
the State of Massachusetts, this is what I 've got 
to say : I 've worked to factories fifty-six years. 
I haven't got drunk not since I was fifteen year 
old. I 've been about as healthy, take it off and 
on, as most folks, and I guess about as smart. 
I 'm a moral man, and I used to be a Methodist 
class-leader. I 've worked to factories fifty-six 
years steady, and I 'm sixty-six year old, and in 
the poor-US. 

" I don't know what the boys would say if they 
see me in the poor-us. 

" I 've married a wife and buried her. I 've 
brought up six children and buried 'em all. Me 
and the bed and the chair and the wall are the 
end on 't. 

" It kmd o' bothers me, off and on, wonderin' 
what the boys would say. 





" There was three as had the scarlet fever, and 
two as I lost in the war (three and two is five ; 
and one — ) there 's one other, but I don't rightly 
remember what she died on. It was a gal, and 
kinder dropped away. 

" I 've worked fifty-six years, and I 've earned 
my bread and butter and my shoes and hats, and 
I give the boys a trade, and I give 'em harnsome 
coffins ; and now I 'm sixty-six year old and in 
the poor-US. 

" Once when I broke my leg, and the gal was 
sick, and the boys was in the tin-shop, and their 
mother she lay abed with that baby that kep' 
her down so long, I struck for higher wages, and 
they turned me off. There was other times as I 
struck for wages, I forget what for, and they 
turned me off. But I was a young man then, 
and so I sawed wood and waited my chances, and 
got to work ag'in, and bided my time, in the 
name of the State of Massachusetts. 

" Now I 've testified afore the Legislature, and 
I 've got my notice ; and away up in New Hamp- 
shyre they knew the yellow ochre on my close, 
and I couldn't get the toothache out o' my voice, 
and I wouldn't disown my honest name, — in 





the name of the State of Massachusetts, I would 
n't beg for honest work, unless I got it in my 
honest name, — and so I am sixty-six year old, 
and in the poor-us. 

" Tell Hayle and Kelso, — will you ? — that 
I 'm sixty-six year old, and an honest man, and 
dead beat out and in the poor-us ! Curse 'em ! 

" All the leaves o' the trees o' the State of Mas- 
sachusetts knows it. All the fields and the rivers 
and the little clouds and the winds o' dark nights 
and the grasses knows it. I told 'em, I told 'em ! 
And you' d never know how they listened — 
See here, marm. I 'm no fool, except for the fever 
on me. I knew when I set out what I 'd got 
to say. I 'm no fool, and I never asked no 
favors from the State of Massachusetts. See 
here ! A workingman, as is only a workingman, 
and as lives and dies a workingman, he 'll earn 
enough to get him vittels, and to get him close, 
and to get him a roof above his head, and he 
genrilly won't earn much more ; and I never 
asked it of the State of Massachusetts as he 
should. But now, look here ! When I was to 
Boston on my journey, I picked up a newspaper 
to the depot, and I read as how a man paid forty 





thousand dollars for the plate-glass winders in 
his house. Now, look here ! I say there 's something 
out o' kilter in that Commonwealth, and in 
that country, and in that lot of human creeturs, 
and in them ways of rulin', and in them ways of 
thinkin', and in God's world itself, when a man 
ken spend forty thousand dollars on the plate- 
glass winders of his house, and I ken work 
industrious and honest all my life and be be- 
holden to the State of Massachusetts for my 
poor-US vittels when I 'm sixty-six year old ! 

" Not but what I 've had money in the bank in 
my day, a many times. I had forty-six dollars 
laid by to once. I went into the dye-rooms that 
year, and my rubber boots was wore out. We 
stand about in dye, and it 's very sloppy work, 
you know. I 'd been off work and out o' cash, 
and so I tried to get along without ; so I wet my 
feet and wet my feet, standing round in the stuff. 
So there was lung fever and doctors' bills enough 
to eat that bank account out as close as famine. 

" Why wasn't I far-seein' enough to get my 

boots to the first place and save my fever .'' Now 

that 's jest sech a question as I 'd look to get 

from them as is them of property. That 's jest a 





specimen o' the kind of stoopidity as always
