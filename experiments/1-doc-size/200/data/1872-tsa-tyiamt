At this moment, piercing the air sharply, came a 
howl of fear from across the corridor. Tom started 
and turned pale. 

" What is that, Hiram ?" he asked, with quivering 
lips. 

" Some poor fellow with mania," I replied. 

" Oh, isn 't it dreadful !" 

Another and more prolonged cry, full of pain 
and terror, smote upon our ears, and we could hear 
struggling in the cells opposite. Tom 's face grew 
whiter. 

For nearly an hour we had to listen to these awful 
cries. Then they died away, and we were thankful 
for the silence that followed. We had commenced 
talking again, when we heard some one unlocking 
our cell door. It was swung open, and the man I 
had seen in the court-room that morning stepped in. 

" Sorry to see you here again," he said, in a kind 
voice, speaking to Tom. " Thought you were going 
to sign the pledge and be a better boy ? What 's the 
matter? What are you here for now?" 

Tom told his story, which was listened to atten 
tively. When he had finished, I said, 

" You may believe every word he says, Mr. Mul 
len. I know him." 



 

" You do ?" and the agent turned on me quickly. 
" How came you to know him ?" 

&lt;; I am in business with his father," I replied, not 
stopping to think what the business was. 

" Oh, are you ?" and he fixed his eyes on me so 
steadily that I had to look away from him. "Then 
all I have to say about it is, that it 's a very bad 
business." 

I turned from him abashed. 

" And you 've been a good, sober boy since you 
left here ?" said Mr. Mullen, the old kindness and in 
terest coming back into his voice as he turned to 
Tom. 

" Haven t touched a drop of liquor. You can ask 
them at the bindery. Mr. Ashley will tell you. Oh, 
Mr. Mullen, if there 's any way to get me out before 
mother knows it It will be dreadful for her. I'm 
all the hope she has now. Oh, Mr. Mullen, help me 
if you can ;" and he burst out crying. 

" There ! there ! Don 't take on about it," said the 
agent, kindly. " I 'll see what can be done." 

He drew hrs watch out from his pocket and looked 
at the time, stood thinking for a few moments and 
then said, with a twinkle of humor in his eyes, 

" If I go your bail, you won t go back on me ?" 

" Not if I die for it !" answered Tom, quickly. 

" Don 't be afraid," I spoke up. " I 'll make it all 
right." 

He gave me a look that said plainly enough, " I 'd 
rather take the boy 's word than your bond !" 



  

I turned away hurt and abashed. I was only a 
liquor-seller, capable in his eyes of any baseness ! 

" Very well. I 'll see the alderman, and you shall 
be with your mother by six o clock," said the agent, 
and he went away. 

In about an hour he came back. 

"All right!" he said, cheerily, as he entered the 
cell again. He did not take any notice of me, and 
was going out with Tom when I put my hand on 
him, saying, 

"Won 't you come and see me, sir? I 'd like to 
talk with you." 

" What about ?" he asked, coldly. 

I dare not say why I wished to see him, for were 
I to do so, I felt that he might deny me wholly. I 
wanted his influence to get me out. 

" A good many things," I answered, evasively. 

"Very well. I'm the prisoner 's friend, and if I 
can help you any shall be glad to do so." 

And he went out with the boy, leaving me lone 
lier and more depressed than ever. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

I SLEPT but little that night. The horrors of 
" purgatory " kept me awake. 

I looked for Mr. Mullen all the next day, but he 
did not come. I heard his voice in the corridor two 
or three times during the afternoon, but he passed 
my cell without calling. A whole week of impris 
onment, and I had not seen him again. I was losing 
heart. There was no hope for me if I could not get 
him to take. up my case. Lloyd, to my surprise and 
indignation, had not come near me. " I might die 
like a dog, for all he cared," I said to myself. Nor 
had any other of my many friends. I was left alone 
in my calamity. 

I was, besides, greatly troubled about my affairs. 
Lloyd had borrowed nearly all my ready money, 
and I more than feared its loss in gambling. He 
was too much under the influence of liquor all the 
while to be any match for the sharpers who had him 
in hand. If I could not get out of this horrid place 
in less than two months, everything would go to 
ruin. He was in danger of being cleaned out at any 
moment would be, I doubted not, before I could be 
at hand to save myself. Then there was the assault- 
and-battery case to be tried in a day or two. He 


might be sent down here for six or nine months, and 
who was to take care of things until I could get out ? 
I chafed and worried and tormented myself with 
evil forebodings helplessly and fruitlessly. 

One afternoon, a little over a week after my sen 
tence, I heard the key turn in my cell door. It 
opened, and the prison agent came in. I did not read 
the kindness and sympathy in his face that I had seen 
there when he interceded for the poor woman in court 
and when he spoke to Tom Lloyd. 

" You don 't  find this quite as pleasant as a room 
in the Girard," he said, betraying a little sarcasm in 
his tones. 

"Not quite," I replied, forcing as much indiffer 
ence into my voice as was possible. 

" Nor are your fellow-lodgers as agreeable," he 
added, giving his head a nod toward the corridor. 
I understood him, and felt irritated would have 
answered roughly, but dared not do so, for I wanted 
him to befriend me. 

" You wished to see me ?" 

" Yes, sir," I replied. 

" I 've been too much occupied in looking after the 
poor creatures rum has brought here to see you be 
fore. And now, what can I do for you ?" 

I saw no hope in his face. It wore a cold severity 
that seemed a stranger to it. 

" I don 't  know that you can or will do anything," 
I replied, with the bitterness I felt. " Men like you 
don 't  have much charity for us." 



 

why should we?" he asked, a softer tone 
coming into his voice. " You are not on our side. 
While we are trying to help and save, you are hurt 
ing and destroying." 

" You judge us too harshly," I said. 

" By their fruits ye shall know them," he replied. 
" What brought to prison the poor boy I found in
