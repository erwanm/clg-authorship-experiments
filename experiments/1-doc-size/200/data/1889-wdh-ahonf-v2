extremely gratified ; and it 's no use pretending that 
I shouldn't be happy beyond bounds to get posses- 
sion of Every Other Week But I don't feel quite 
free to talk about it apart from Mr. Fulkcrson." 

" Oh, all right ! " said the old man, with quick 
offence. 

March hastened to say, " I feel bound to Mr. Ful- 
kerson in every way. He got me to come here, and 
I couldn't even seem to act without him." 

He put it questioningly, and the old man an- 
swered, "Yes, I can see tliat. When 'll he be in ? I 
can wait." But he looked impatient. 

"Very soon, now," said March, looking at his 
watch. " He was only to be gone a moment," and 
while he went on to talk with Dryfoos, he wondered 
why the old man should have come first to speak 
with hira, and whe the r it was from some obscure 
wish to make him reparation for displeasures in the 
past, or from a distnist or dislike of Fulkerson. 
Whichever light he looked at it in, it was flattering. 

"Do you think of going abroad soon ?" he asked. 

" What ? Yes — I don't know— I reckon. We 




  

got our passage engaged. It's on one of tlicm 
French boats. "We 're goin' to Paris." 

" Oh ! That will be interesting to the young 
ladies." 

"Yes. I reckon we 're goin' for them. "Tain't 
likely my wife and me would want to pull up stakes 
at our age," said the old man sorrowfully. 

"But you may find it do you good, Mr. Dryfoos," 
said March, with a kindness that was real, mixed as 
it was with the selfish interest he now had in the 
intended voyage. 

" "Well, may be, may be," sighed the old man ; and 
he dropped his head forward. " It don't make a 
great deal of difference what we do or we don't do, 
for the few years left." 

"I hope Mrs. Di-yfoos is as well as usual," said 
March, finding the ground delicate and difficult. 

"Middhn', middlin'," said the old man. "My 
daughter Christine, she ain't very well." 

"Oh," said March. It was quite impossible for 
him to affect a more explicit interest in the fact. 
He and Dryfoos sat silent for a few moments, and 
he was vainly casting about in his thought for some- 
thing else which would tide them over the interval 
till Fulkerson came, when he heard his step on the 
stairs. 

" Hello, hello !" he said. " Meeting of the clans !" 
It was always a meeting of the clans, with Fulker- 
son, or a field day, or an extra session, or a regular 
conclave, whenever he saw people of any common 
interest together. " Hain't seen you here for a good 



  

while, Mr. Dryfoos. Did think some of running 
away with Evcrji Olhcr JFecIc one while, but couldn't 
seem to work March up to the point," 

He gave Dryfoos his hand, and pushed aside the 
papers on the corner of March's desk, and sat dowii 
there, and went on briskly with the nonsense ho 
could always talk, while he was waiting for another 
to develop any matter of business ; he told March 
afterward that he scented business in the air as soon 
as he came into the room where he and Dryfoos 
were sitting. 

Dryfoos seemed determined to leave the word to 
March, who said, after an inquiring look at him, 
" Mr. Dryfoos has been proposing to let us have 
Every Other Week, Fulkerson." 

" Well, that 's good ; that suits yours truly ; March 
& Fulkerson, publishers and proprietors, won't pre- 
tend it don't, if the terms are all right." 

" The terms," said the old man, " are whatever 
you want 'em. I haven't got any more use for the 

concern " He gulped, and stopped ; they knew 

what he was thinking of, and they looked down in 
pity. He went on. " I woon't put any more money 
in it ; but what I 've put in a'ready, can stay ; and 
you can pay me four per cent." 

He got upon his feet ; and March and Fulkerson 
stood, too. 

" Well, I call that pretty white," said Fulkerson. 
" It 's a bargain as far as I 'm concerned. I suppose 
you'll want to talk it over with your wife, March ? " 

*•' Yes ; I shall," said March. " I can see that it 's 



  

a great cliauce ; but I want to talk it over vith my 
wife." 

"Well, that's right," said the old man. "Let me 
hear from you to-morrow." 

He went out, and Fulkerson began to dance round 
the room. He caught !March about his stalwart girth 
and tried to make him valtz ; the office-boy came to 
the door, and looked on with approval. 

" Come, come, you idiot ! " said March, rooting 
himself to the carpet. 

"It's just throwing the thing into our mouths," 
said Fulkerson. " The wedding will be this day 
week. No cards ! Teedle-lumpty diddle ! Tfcdlc- 
lumpty-dee ! What do you suppose he means by it, 
March ? " he asked, bringing himself soberly up, of a 
sudden. " What is his little game ? Or is he crazy ? 
It don't seem like the Dryfoos of idij previous 
acquaintance." 

" I suppose," March suggested, " that he 's got 
money enough, so that lie don't care for this " 

" Pshaw ! You 're a poet ! Don't you know that 
the more money that kind of man has got, the more 
he cares for money ? It 's some fancy of his — like 

ha\'ing Lindau's funeral at his house By j.ings, 

March, I believe you 're his fancy !" 

" Oh, now ! Don't , be a poet, Fulkerson ! " 

" I do ! He seemed to take a kind of shine to you 
from the day you wouldn't turn off old Lindau ; he 
did indeed. It kind of shook him up. It made him 
think you had something in you. He was deceived 
by appearances. Look here ! I 'm going round to 



see Mrs. March with you, and explain the tiling to 
her. I hiow Mrs. March ! She wouldn't believe 
you knew what you were going in for. She has a 
great respect for your mind, but she don't think 
you 've got any sense. Heigh \ " 

" All right," said March, glad of the notion ; and 
it was really a comfort to have Fulkerson with him 
to develop all the points ; and it was delightful to 
see how clearly va\\ quickly she seized them ; it 
made March proud of her. She was only angry 
that they had lost any time in coming to submit 
so plain a case to her. Mr. Dryfoos might change 
his mind in the night, and then everything would 
be lost. They must go to him instantly, and tell 
him that they accepted ; they must telegraph him. 

"Might as well send a district messenger; he'd 
get there next week," said Fulkerson. " No, no ! 
It'll all keep till to-morrow, and be the better for 
it. If he 's got this fancy for March, as I say, he 
ain't agoing to change it in a single night. People 
don't change their fancies for March in a lifetime. 
Heigh ? " 

When Fulkerson turned up very early at the 
office next morning, as March did, he was less 
strenuous about Dryfoos's fancy for March. It was 
as if Miss Woodburn might have blown cold upon 
that theory, as something unjust to his own merit, 
for which she would naturally be more jealous than 
he.
