upon cushions and bow heads while they did so; but that in a
common-roofed house, on no particular occasion, anybody should
kneel down to pray when he was alone and for his own sake, was
something that had never come under her knowledge; and it gave
her a disagreeable sort of shock. She lay awake and watched to
see how soon Mrs. Landholm's light would go away; it died, the
faint moonlight stole in through the window unhindered; and
still there was no stir in the next room. Elizabeth watched
and wondered; till after a long half hour she heard a light
step in the kitchen and then a very light fall of the latch.
She sprang up to look at the moon; it had but little risen;
she calculated the time of its rising for several nights back,
and made up her mind that it must be long past twelve. And
this a woman who was tired every day with her day's work and
had been particularly tired to-night! for Elizabeth had
noticed it. It made her uncomfortable. Why should she spend
her tired minutes in praying, after the whole house was
asleep? and why was it that Elizabeth could not set her down
as a fool for her pains? And on the contrary there grew up in
her mind, on the instant, a respect for the whole family that
wrapped them about like a halo.

One morning when Elizabeth came through the kitchen to mount
her horse, Mrs. Landholm was doing some fine ironing. The blue
habit stopped a moment by the ironing-table.

"How dreadfully busy you are, Mrs. Landholm."

"Not so busy that I shall not come out and see you start," she
answered. "I always love to do that."

"Winnie," said Elizabeth putting a bank bill into the little
girl's hand, "I shall make you my messenger. Will you give
that to the man who takes care of my horse, for I never see
him, and tell him I say he does his work beautifully."

Winifred blushed and hesitated, and handing the note back said
that she had rather not.

"Won't you give it to him!"

The little girl coloured still more. "He don't want it."

"Keep your money, my dear," said Mrs. Landholm; "there is no
necessity for your giving him anything."

"But why shouldn't I give it to him if I like it?" said
Elizabeth in great wonderment.

"It is a boy that works for my father, Miss Haye," said
Winthrop gravely; "your money would be thrown away upon him."

"But in this he works for me."

"He don't know that."

"If he don't -- Money isn't thrown away upon anybody, that ever
I heard of," said Elizabeth; "and besides, what if I choose to
throw it away?"

"You can. Only that it is doubtful whether it would be picked
up."

"You think he wouldn't take it?"

"I think it is very likely."

"What a fool! -- Then I shall send away my horse!" said
Elizabeth; "for either he must be under obligation to me, or I
to him; and I don't choose the latter."

"Do you expect to get through the world without being under
obligation to anybody?" said Winthrop smiling.

But Elizabeth had turned, and marching out of the house did
not make any reply.

"What's the objection to being under obligation, Miss
Elizabeth?" said Mrs. Landholm. Elizabeth was mounting her
horse, in which operation Winthrop assisted her.

"It don't suit me!"

"Fortune's suits do not always fit," said Winthrop. "But then
--"

"Then what?" --

"She never alters them."

Elizabeth's eyes fired, and an answer was on her lip, but
meeting the very composed face of the last speaker, as he put
her foot in the stirrup, she thought better of it. She looked
at him and asked,

"What if one does not choose to wear them?"

"Nothing for it but to fight Fortune," said Winthrop smiling;
-- "or go without any."

"I would rather go anyhow!" said Elizabeth, -- "than be obliged
to anybody, -- of course except to my father."

"How if you had a husband?" inquired Mrs. Landholm with a
good-humoured face.

It was a turn Elizabeth did not like; she did not answer Mrs.
Landholm as she would have answered her cousin. She hesitated.

"I never talk about that, Mrs. Landholm," she said a little
haughtily, with a very pretty tinge upon her cheek; -- "I would
not be obliged to anybody but my father; -- never."

"Why?" said Mrs. Landholm. "I don't understand."

"Don't you see, Mrs. Landholm, -- the person under obligation
is always the inferior."

"I never felt it so," she replied.

Her guest could not feel, what her son did, the strong
contrast they made. One little head was held as if certainly
the neck had never been bowed under any sort of pressure; the
other, in its meek dignity, spoke the mind of too noble a
level to be either raised or lowered by an accident.

"It is another meaning of the word, mother, from that you arc
accustomed to," Winthrop said.

Elizabeth looked at him, but nothing was to be gained from his
face.

"Will you have the goodness to hand me my riding-whip," she
said shortly.

"You will have to be obliged to me for that," he said as he
picked it up.

"Yes," said Elizabeth; "but I pay for this obligation with a
'thank you'!"

So she did, and with a bow at once a little haughty and not a
little graceful. It was the pure grace of nature, the very
speaking of her mind at the moment. Turning her horse's head
she trotted off, her blue habit fluttering and her little head
carried very gracefully to the wind and her horse's motion.
They stood and looked after her.

"Poor child!" said Mrs. Landholm, -- "she has something to
learn. There is good in her too."

"Ay," said her son, "and there is gold in the earth; but it
wants hands."

"Yes," said Mrs. Landholm, -- "if she only fell into good hands
--"

It might have been tempting, to a certain class of minds, to
look at that pretty little figure flying off at full trot in
all the riot of self-guidance, and to know that it only wanted
good hands to train her into something really fine. But Mrs.
Landholm went back to her ironing, and Winthrop to drive his
oxen a field.

Elizabeth trotted till she had left them out of sight; and
then walked her horse slowly while she thought what had been
meant by that queer speech of Winthrop's. Then she reminded
herself that it was of no sort of consequence what had been
meant by it, and she trotted on again.

Asahel as usual came out to hold her bridle when she returned.

"Asahel, who takes care of my horse?" she said as she was
dismounting.

"Ain't it handsomely done?" said Asahel.

"Yes, -- beautifully. Who does it?"

"It's somebody that always does things so," said Asahel
oracularly, a little in doubt how he should answer.

"Well, who?"

"Don't you know?"

"Of course I don't! Who is it?"

"It's Winthrop."

"Winthrop!" --

"Yes. He does it."

Elizabeth's cheeks burnt.

"Where's that man of yours -- why don't he do it?"

"Sam? -- O he don't know -- I guess he ain't up to it."
