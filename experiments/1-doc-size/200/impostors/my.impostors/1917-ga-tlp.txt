The poor of France do not invest their money in 
savings' banks. They buy bonds. On the Monday 
after mobilization the banks of France announced 
that they would buy no bonds. These poor bewildered 
women would have starved if the women of the more 
fortunate classes had not immediately begun to organize relief stations and ouvroirs. 

Madame Lepauze, better known to the reading public of France as Daniel Lesauer, who is also the wife 
of the curator of the Petit Palais, was the first to 
open a restaurant for soup, and this was besieged 
from morning until night even before the refugees 
from Belgium and the invaded districts of France 
began to pour in. Her home is in the Petit Palais, 
and in the public gardens behind was Le Pavillion, one 
of the prettiest and most popular restaurants of Paris. 
She made no bones about asking the proprietor to 
place the restaurant and all that remained of his staff 
at her disposal, and hastily organizing a committee, 
began at once to ladle out soup. Many other depots 
were organized almost simultaneously (and not only 
in Paris but in the provincial towns), and when women 
were too old or too feeble to come for their daily 
ration it was left at their doors by carts containing 



 

immense boilers of that nourishing soup only the 
French know how to make. 

Madame Lepauze estimates that her station alone 
fed a million women and children. Moreover, she 
and all the other women engaged in this patriotic duty- 
had soon depleted their wardrobes after the refugees 
began streaming down from the north; it was generally said that not a lady in Paris had more than 
one useful dress left and that was on her back. 

Many of these charitable women fled to the South 
during that breathless period when German occupation seemed inevitable, but others, like Madame Pierre 
Goujon, of whom I shall have much to say later, and 
the Countess Greffuhle (a member of the valiant 
Chimay family of Belgium), stuck to their posts and 
went about publicly in order to give courage to the 
millions whose poverty forced them to remain. 

II 

The next step in aiding this army of helpless women 
was to open ouvroirs, or workrooms. Madame 
Paquin never closed this great branch of her dress- 
making establishment, and, in common with hundreds 
of other ouvroirs that sprang up all over France, paid 
the women a wage on which they could exist (besides 
giving them one meal) in return for at least half a 
day's work on necessary articles for the men in the 
trenches : underclothing, sleeping bags, felt slippers, 
night garments; sheets and pillow-cases for the hospitals. As the vast majority of the peasant farmers 
and petite bourgeoisie had been used to sleeping in airtight rooms they suffered bitterly during that first 
long winter and spring in the open. If it had not been 
for these bee-hive ouvroirs and their enormous output 
there would have been far more deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis, and far more cases of tuberculosis than there were. 

A good many of these ouvroirs are still in existence, 
but many have been closed ; for as the shops reopened 
the women not only went back to their former situations but by degrees either applied for or were invited to fill those left vacant by men of fighting age. 



And then there were the munition factories! The 
manager of one of these Usines de Guerre in Paris 
told me that he made the experiment of employing 
women with the deepest misgiving. Those seeking 
positions were just the sort of women he would have 
rejected if the sturdy women of the farms had applied and given him any choice. They were girls or 
young married women who had spent all the working years of their lives stooping over sewing-machines ; 
sunken chested workers in artificial flowers; confectioners ; florists ; waitresses ; clerks. One and all looked 
on the verge of a decline with not an ounce of reserve 
vitality for work that taxed the endurance of men. 
But as they protested that they not only wished to 



 

support themselves instead of living on charity, but 
were passionately desirous of doing their bit while 
their men were enduring the dangers and privations 
of active warfare, and as his men were being withdrawn daily for service at the Front, he made up his 
mind to employ them and refill their places as rapidly 
as they collapsed. 

He took me over his great establishment and showed 
me the result. It was one of the astonishing examples not only of the grim courage of women under 
pressure but of that nine-lived endowment of the 
female in which the male never can bring himself to 
believe save only when confronted by practical demonstration. 

In the correspondence and card-indexing room 
there was a little army of young and middle-aged 
women whose superior education enabled them to do 
a long day's work with the minimum output of physical energy, and these for the most part came from 
solid middle-class families whose income had been 
merely cut by the war, not extinguished. It was as I 
walked along the galleries and down the narrow passages between the noisy machinery of the rest of that 
large factory that I asked the superintendent again 
and again if these women were of the same class as 
the original applicants. The answer in every case was 
the same. 

The women had high chests and brawny arms. 
They tossed thirty- and forty-pound shells from one 
to the other as they once may have tossed a cluster of 



 

artificial flowers. Their skins were clean and often 
ruddy. Their eyes were bright. They showed no 
signs whatever of overwork. They were almost without exception the original applicants. 

I asked the superintendent if there were no danger 
of heart strain. He said there had been no sign of 
it so far. Three times a week they were inspected by 
women doctors appointed by the Government, and any 
little disorder was attended to at once. But not one 
had been ill a day. Those that had suffered from 
chronic dyspepsia, colds, and tubercular tendency were 
now as strong as if they had lived their lives on farms. 
It was all a question of plenty of fresh air, and work 
that strengthened the muscles of their bodies, developed their chests and gave them stout nerves and 
long nights of sleep. 

As I looked at those bare heavily muscled arms I 
wondered if any man belonging to them would ever 
dare say his soul was his own again. But as their 
heads are always charmingly dressed (an odd effect 
surmounting greasy overalls) and as they invariably 
powder before filing out at the end of the day's work, 
it is probable that a comfortable reliance may still 
be placed upon the ineradicable coquetry of the French 
woman. And the scarcer the men in the future the 
more numerous, no doubt, will be the layers of powder. 

I asked one pretty girl if she really liked the heavy, 
dirty, malodorous work, and she replied that making 
boutonnieres for gentlemen in a florist-shop was paradise by contrast, but she was only too happy to be 



 

doing as much for France in her way as her brother 
was in his. She added that when the war was over 
she should take off her blue linen apron streaked with 
machine grease once for all, not remain from choice 
as many would. But meanwhile it was not so bad! 
She made ten francs a day. Some of the women received as high as fifteen. Moreover, they bossed the 
few men whose brawn was absolutely indispensable 
and must be retained in the usine at all costs. 

These men took their orders meekly. Perhaps they 
were amused. The French are an ironic race. Perhaps they bided their time. But they never dreamed 
of disobeying those Amazons whose foot the Kaiser 
of all the Boches had placed on their necks.

One of the greatest of these U sines de Guerre is 
at Lyons, in the buildings of the Exposition held 
shortly before the outbreak of the war. I went to 
this important Southern city (a beautiful city, which 
I shall always associate with the scent of locust-blossoms at the suggestion of James Hazen Hyde. He 
gave me a letter to the famous Mayor, M. Herriot, 
who was a member of the last Briand Cabinet. 

M. Herriot was also a Senator, and as he was leaving for Paris a few hours after I presented my letter 
he turned me over to a friend of his wife, Madame 
Castell, a native of Lyons, the daughter of one silk 
 
merchant and the widow of another. This charming 
young woman, who had spent her married life in New 
York, by the way, took me everywhere, and although 
we traversed many vast distances in the Mayor's auto- 
mobile, it seemed to me that I walked as many miles 
in hospitals, factories, ateliers (workrooms for teaching the mutilated new trades), and above all in the 
Usine de Guerre. 

Here not only were thousands of women employed 
but a greater variety of classes. The women of the 
town, unable to follow the army and too plucky to live 
on charity, had been among the first to ask for work. 
The directeur beat his forehead when I asked him how 
they behaved when not actually at the machines, but 
at least they had proved as faithful and skillful as their 
more respectable sisters. 

Lyons was far more crowded and lively than Paris,
