ing until I had taken a stiff glass or two of brandy 
and water. After that I was all right, and drew and 
poured and mixed liquors with as ready a will as my 
partner and without a care for the good or evil 
of any one. 



 

Among our visitors from the bindery and printing- 
office this evening was Harry Glenn, the young 
printer mentioned in the preceding chapter. He had 
a wife and one child. 

" Why, Harry ! Glad to see you !" I heard one 
of the men exclaim as he came in. 

Glenn returned the greeting cordially, and then 
said, 

" Take a glass of beer with me ?" 

" Don 't care if I do," was answered, and they 
stepped forward to the bar. 

"Thought of your nice, cozy place after supper, 
Hiram," said Glenn as he stood with glass in hand, 
" and couldn 't stay away. I declare ! You and Lloyd 
have done the thing up elegantly. And then one 
can meet the fellows here, and it 's pleasant to see 
people. Don 't know when I was in a tavern before 
last night." 

"Always glad to have you come in," I replied. 

" I wonder what his wife would say if she knew 
where he was?" remarked a fellow-journeyman as 
Glenn crossed to the other side of the bar-room. 

" Growl, like some other women I know, instead 
of trying to make home comfortable," was answered 
by a man who was leaning on the bar. He had 
been drinking before he came in, and was consider 
ably in liquor. 

" I don 't  know about her growling," said another. 
" She isn 't that kind." 

" Who was she ?" asked the first speaker. 





" Heniy Lawrence 's daughter." 

" Katy Lawrence ?" 

"Yes." 

" Oh ! I knew Katy very well. She was a pretty, 
gay little thing. I 'd forgotten about her marrying 
Glenn. I wonder what sort of a wife she makes ?" 

" So-so-ish," was answered with a lifting of the 
speaker 's brows and a meaning shrug of his shoul 
ders. " It was very nice to get married. Most girls 
think so, but I have my guess about the house 
keeping and all that. Men about to marry are apt, 
you know, to draw fancy pictures of home-life the 
cozy room, the warm evening fire, the dressing-gown 
and slippers, and, above all, the smiling young wife 
daintily attired, with, maybe, a white rosebud in her 
hair, to crown her husband 's blessings. But he 
doesn 't always find it so. The young wife has her 
fancies too. She may be fonder of social life than 
her husband, may have a love of dress and admi 
ration, may have no taste for household affairs, may 
be weak, vain, selfish, self-indulgent and slovenly at 
home. The more of them we have, friend Hiram, 
the better for you." 

And the man laughed, but not heartily. There 
was an undertone of pain in his voice. 

" Then we re likely to see Glenn once in a while ?" 
I remarked. 

" Treat him well, and you 'll see him often," was 
the reply. 

" We expect to do that to every one," said I. 


 

" Of course. You know your business ;" and the 
man turned and went away. 

There were now in the room four boys who 
worked in the bindery. They were between the 
ages of fourteen and seventeen. Only two of them 
had, so far, come to the bar for liquor. The others 
had not yet acquired an appetite for drink, and 
merely dropped in to meet each other and pass the 
time away. Two were the sons of widowed moth 
ers and another the son of a poor clergyman, all of 
whom would have been in great trouble of mind if 
they had known into what associations and peril 
their sons were drifting. 

" Let 's have some beer, Ned Allen," I heard one 
of these lads say to the clergyman 's son. 

The boy shook his head, at the same time laying 
his hand against his empty pocket. 

"Oh, I 'll stand treat. Come along!" urged the 
other, and the two boys came up. Small glasses of 
beer were called for, and I drew and set them on 
the counter. They were minors ; it was against the 
law to sell them intoxicating drinks, and punishable 
with fine and imprisonment. I knew this, and 
thought of it as I handed them the beer, but I was 
reckless now. The brandy I had taken made it all 
right with my conscience, and I silently cursed the 
law. 

The boys emptied their glasses, young Allen in a 
half-shy way, as if conscious that he was out of 
place and doing wrong. 





When I next took notice of the lads, they were 
listening, with evident satisfaction, to some very dirty 
and obscene talk that was going on among two or 
three men of the coarser sort, joining in the laugh 
when anything witty was said, the wit always turn 
ing on something grossly indelicate. So their minds 
were filled with lewd ideas and their imaginations 
corrupted. 

" I wonder if John Ashley has gone home yet ?" 
I remarked to Lloyd, about half-past ten o clock that 
evening. 

" I guess so," he replied. 

" Haven t seen him come down," I said. 

"Went out at the side door, most likely." 

I ran up stairs to see if this were so, and found 
him leaning on a table fast asleep. I aroused him 
with some difficulty. To my great relief, he was 
not drunk. He was tired, having been at work all 
day, and, after spending an hour or two in talking 
and playing cards, bent down over the table at which 
he was sitting, and fell asleep. 

As soon as he came fairly to his senses he looked 
scared and hurried away. I said to him as he was 
going, 

" Mind, John, it won t do to say you were here." 

" Oh no. Trust me for that," he answered, 
promptly. Then, with a sly, comical look, " Been 
to the reading club. That 's the go! All right!" 
and away he went, taking the side door instead of 
passing through the bar. 



CHAPTER IX. 

WE could not have asked a better beginning. 
Our customers were at our very door, and 
came without invitation. We needed no drummers 
nor travelers, no advertising nor expensive ways 
of drawing attention to our wares. Men 's appetites 
were all on our side, and brought us into favor. 

For the first two or three months scarcely a day 
went over that I was not surprised at the character 
of some of our customers. Men from all grades of 
life came in to drink, among them citizens of high 
social and even religious standing. Old gray-headed 
men and youngsters in their teens often stood side 
by side at the bar drinking. The father would come 
in, get his glass and go, and soon after the son would 
stand in his place, just missing each other. Now 
and then a father and his son would come face to 
face, each surprised maybe pained and shocked 
at the encounter. Clerks and employers would 
have like meetings, often to the chagrin and un
