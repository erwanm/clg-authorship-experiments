"It tires me a little--generally. Not to-day."

"No, I see it has not; and how you come out of that den, looking as you
do, I confess is an incomprehensible thing to me. What has pleased you
there?"

A smile came upon Eleanor's face, so bright as shewed it was but the
outbreaking of the light he had seen there before. His question she met
with another.

"Did nothing there please you?"

"Do you mean to evade my inquiry?"

"I will tell you what pleased me," said Eleanor. "Perhaps you
remarked--whereabouts were you?"

"A few feet behind you and your scholars."

"Then perhaps you remarked a boy who came in when the lesson was partly
done--midway in the time--a boy who came in and took his seat in my
class."

"I remarked him--and you will excuse me for saying, I do not understand
how pleasure can be connected in anybody's mind with the sight of him."

"Of course you do not. That boy has been a most notorious pickpocket
and thief."

"Exactly what I should have supposed."

"Did you observe that he had washed his face?"

"I think I observed how imperfectly it was done."

"Ah, but it is the first time probably in years that it has touched
water, except when his lips touched it to drink. Do you know, that is a
sign of reformation?"

"Water?"

"Washing. It is the hardest thing in the world to get them to forego
the seal and the bond of dirt. It is a badge of the community of guilt.
If they will be brought to wash, it is a sign that the bond is
broken--that they are willing to be out of the community; which will I
suppose regard them as suspected persons from that time. Now you can
understand why I was glad."

Hardly; for the fire and water sparkling together in Eleanor's eyes
expressed so much gladness that it quite went beyond Mr. Carlisle's
power of sympathy. He remained silent a few moments.

"Eleanor, I wish you would answer one question, which puzzles me. Why
do you go to that place?"

"You do not like it?"

"No, nor do you. What takes you there?"

"There are more to be taught than there are teachers for," said Eleanor
looking at her questioner. "They want help. You must have seen, there
are none too many to take care of the crowds that come; and many of
those teachers are fatigued with attendance in the week."

"Do you go in the week?"

"No, not hitherto."

"You must not think of it! It is as much as your life is worth to go
Sundays. I met several companies of most disorderly people on my
way--do you not meet such?"

"Yes."

"What takes you there, Eleanor, through such horrors?"

"I have no fear."

"No, I suppose not; but will you answer my question?"

"You will hardly be able to understand me," said Eleanor hesitating. "I
like to go to these poor wretches, because I love them. And if you ask
me why I love them,--I know that the Lord Jesus loves them; and he is
not willing they should be in this forlorn condition; and so I go to
try to help get them out of it."

"If the Supreme Ruler is not willing there should be this class of
people, Eleanor, how come they to exist?"

"You are too good a philosopher, Mr. Carlisle, not to know that men are
free agents, and that God leaves them the exercise of their free
agency, even though others as well as themselves suffer by it. I
suppose, if those a little above them in the social scale had lived
according to the gospel rule, this class of people never would have
existed."

"What a reformer you would make, Eleanor!"

"I should not suit you? Yes--I do not believe in any radical way of
reform but one."

"And that is, what?--counsellor."

"Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you."

"Radical enough! You must reform the reformers first, I suppose you
know."

"I know it."

"Then, hard as it is for me to believe it, you do not go to Field-Lane
by way of penance?"

"The penance would be, to make me stay away."

"Mrs. Powle will do that, unless I contrive to disturb the action of
her free agency; but I think I shall plunge into the question of
reform, Eleanor. Speaking of that, how much reformation has been
effected by these Ragged institutions?"

"Very much; and they are only as it were beginning, you must remember."

"Room for amendment still," said Mr. Carlisle. "I never saw such a
disorderly set of scholars in my life before. How do you find an
occasional somersault helps a boy's understanding of his lesson?"

"Those things were constant at first; not occasional," said Eleanor
smiling; "somersaults, and leaping over the forms, and shouts and
catcalls, and all manner of uproarious behaviour. That was before I
ever knew them. But now, think of that boy's washed face!"

"That was the most partial reformation I ever saw rejoiced in," said
Mr. Carlisle.

"It gives hope of everything else, though. You have no idea what a bond
that community of dirt is. But there are plenty of statistics, if you
want those, Mr. Carlisle. I can give you enough of them; shewing what
has been done."

"Will you shew them to me to-night?"

"To-night? it is Sunday. No, but to-morrow night, Mr. Carlisle; or any
other time."

"Eleanor, you are very strict!"

"Not at all. That is not strictness; but Sunday is too good to waste
upon statistics."

She said it somewhat playfully, with a shilling of her old arch smile,
which did not at all reassure her companion.

"Besides, Mr. Carlisle, you like strictness a great deal better than I
do. There is not a law made in our Queen's reign or administered under
her sceptre, that you would not have fulfilled to the letter--even down
to the regulations that keep little boys off the grass. It is only the
laws of the Great King which you do not think should be strictly kept."

She was grave enough now, and Mr. Carlisle swallowed the reproof as
best he might.

"Eleanor, you are going to turn preacher too, as well as reformer?
Well, I will come to you, dear, and put myself under your influences.
You shall do what you please with me."

Too much of a promise, and more of a responsibility than Eleanor chose
to take. She went into the house with a sober sense that she had a
difficult part to play; that between Mr. Carlisle and her mother, she
must walk very warily or she would yet find herself entangled before
she was aware. And Mr. Carlisle too had a sober sense that Eleanor's
religious character was not of a kind to exhale, like a volatile oil,
under the sun of prosperity or the breezes of flattery. Nevertheless,
the more hard to reach the prize, the more of a treasure when reached.
He never wanted her more than now; and Mr. Carlisle had always, by
skill and power, obtained what he wanted. He made no doubt he would
find this instance like the others.

For the present, the thing was to bring a bill into parliament "for the
reformation of juvenile offenders"--and upon its various provisions Mr.
Carlisle came daily to consult Eleanor, and take advice and receive
information. Doubtless there was a great deal to be considered about
the bill, to make it just what it should be; to secure enough and not
insist upon too much; its bearings would be very important, and every
point merited well the deepest care and most circumspect management. It
enlisted Eleanor's heart and mind thoroughly; how should it not? She
spent hours and hours with Mr. Carlisle over it; wrote for him, read
for him, or rather for those the bill wrought for; talked and discussed
and argued, for and against various points which she felt would make
for or against its best success. Capital for M. Carlisle. All this
brought him into constant close intercourse with her, and gave him
opportunities of recommending himself. And not in vain. Eleanor saw and
appreciated the cool, clear business head; the calm executive talent,
which seeing its ends in the distance, made no hurry but took the steps
and the measures surest to attain them, with patient foresight. She
admired it, and sometimes also could almost have trembled when she
thought of its being turned towards herself. And was it not, all the
while? Was not Eleanor tacitly, by little and little, yielding the
ground she fought so hard to keep? Was she not quietly giving her
affirmative to the world's question,--and to Mr. Carlisle's too? To the
