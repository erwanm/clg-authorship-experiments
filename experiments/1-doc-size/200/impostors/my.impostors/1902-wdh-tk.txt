FEW witnesses of the fact that Julia Easmith 
and her mother had found themselves on the same 
steamer with the Kev. Hugh Breckon would have 
been of such a simple mind as to think they were 
there by accident, if they had also been witnesses 
of their earlier history. The ladies could have urged 
that in returning from California only a few days 
before the Amstel sailed, and getting a state-room 
which had been unexpectedly given up, they had 
some claim to a charitable interpretation of their 
behavior, but this plea could not have availed them 
with any connoisseur of women. Besides, it had 
been a matter of notoriety among such of Mr. Breck- 
on 's variegated congregation as knew one another 
that Mrs. Rasmith had set her heart on him, if 
Julia had not set her cap for him. In that pied 
flock, where every shade and dapple of doubt, from 
heterodox Jew to agnostic Christian, foregathered, 
as it had been said, in the misgiving of a blessed 
immortality, the devotion of Mrs. Rasmith to the 
minister had been almost a scandal. Nothing had 
saved the appearance from this character but Mr. 
Breckon 's open acceptance of her flatteries and 



 

hospitalities; this was so frank, and the behavior 
of Julia herself so judicious under the circum 
stances, that envy and virtue were, if not equally 
silenced, equally baffled. So far from pretending not 
to see her mother 's manoauvres, Julia invited public 
recognition of them; in the way of joking, which 
she kept within the limits of filial fondness, she 
made fun of her mother 's infatuation to Breckon 
himself, and warned him against the moment when 
her wiles might be too much for him. Before other 
people she did not hesitate to save him from her 
mother, so that even those who believed her in the 
conspiracy owned that no girl could have managed 
with more cleverness in a situation where not every 
one would have refused to be placed. In this situ 
ation Julia Rasmith had the service of a very clear 
head, and as was believed by some, a cool heart; 
if she and her mother had joint designs upon the 
minister, hers was the ambition, and her mother 's 
the affection that prompted them. She was a long, 
undulant girl, of a mixed blondness that left you 
in doubt, after you had left her, whether her hair 
or her complexion were not of one tint; but her 
features were good, and there could be no question 
of her captivating laugh, and her charming mouth, 
which she was always pulling down with demure 
irony. She was like her mother in her looks, but 
her indolent, drolling temperament must have been 
from her father, whose memory was lost in that 
antiquity which swallows up the record of so many 
widows husbands, and who could not have left 



 

her what was left of her mother 's money, for none 
of it had ever been his. It was still her mother s, 
and it was supposed to be the daughter 's chief 
attraction. There must, therefore, have been a good 
deal of it, for those who were harshest with the 
minister did not believe that a little money would 
attract him. Not that they really thought him 
mercenary; some of his people considered him gay 
to the verge of triviality, but there were none that 
accused him of insincerity. They would have liked 
a little more seriousness in him, especially when 
they had not much of their own, and would have 
had him make up in severity of behavior for what 
he lacked, and what they wished him to lack, in 
austerity of doctrine. 

The Amstel had lost so much time in the rough 
weather of her first days out that she could not 
make it up with her old-fashioned single screw. 
She was at best a ten -day boat, counting from 
Sandy Hook to Boulogne, and she had not been 
four days out when she promised to break her 
record for slowness. Three days later Miss Ras- 
mith said to Breckon, as he took the chair which 
her mother agilely abandoned to him beside her: 
" The head steward says it will be a twelve-day trip, 
and our bedroom steward thinks more. What ia 
the consensus of opinion in the smoking-room? 
Where are you going, mother? Are you planning 
to leave Mr. Breckon and me alone again? It isn 't 
necessary. We couldn 't get away from each other 
if we tried, and all we ask Well, I suppose age 



 

must be indulged in its little fancies," she called 
after Mrs. Kasmith. 

Breckon took up the question she had asked him. 
" The odds are so heavily in favor of a fifteen- 
days run that there are no takers." 

" Now you are joking again," she said. " I 
thought a sea-voyage might make you serious." 

" It has been tried before. Besides, it 's you that 
I want to be serious." 

"What about? Besides, I doubt it." 

" About Boyne." 

" Oh ! I thought you were going to say some one 
else." 

" No, I think that is very well settled." 

"You 'll never persuade my mother," said Miss 
Rasmith, with a low, comfortable laugh. 

" But if you are satisfied " 

" She will have to resign herself ? Well, perhaps. 
But why do you wish me to be serious about 
Boyne?" 

" I have no doubt he amuses you. But that doesn 't 
seem a very good reason why you should amuse 
yourself with him." 

"No? Why not?" 

"Well, because the poor boy is in earnest; and 
you 're not exactly contemporaries." 

" Why, how old is Boyne ?" she asked, with affect 
ed surprise. 

"About fifteen, I think," said Breckon, gravely. 

" And I 'm but a very few months past thirty. I 
don 't see the great disparity. But he is merely a 



 

brother to me an elder brother and he gives me 
the best kind of advice." 

" I dare say you need it, but all the same, I am 
afraid you are putting ideas into his head." 

" Well, if he began it ? If he put them in mine 
first?" 

She was evidently willing that he should go fur 
ther, and create the common ground between them 
that grows up when one gives a reproof and the 
other accepts it ; but Breckon, whether he thought 
that he had now done his duty, and need say no more, 
or because he was vexed with her, left the subject. 

" Mrs. Rasmith says you are going to Switzer 
land for the rest of the summer." 

"Yes, to Montreux. Are you going to spend it 
in Paris?" 

" I 'm going to Paris to see. I have had some 
thoughts of Etretat; I have cousins there." 

" I wish that I could go to the sea-side. But this 
happens to be one of the summers when nothing 
but mountains can save my mother 's life. Shall 
you get down to Rome before you go back?" 

" I don 't know. If I sail from Naples I shall 
probably pass through Rome." 

"You had better stop off. We shall be there in 
November, and they say Rome is worth seeing." 
She laughed demurely. " That is what Boyne un 
derstands. He 's promised to use his influence with 
his family to let him run down to see us there, if 
he can 't get them all to come. You might offer 

to personally conduct them."
