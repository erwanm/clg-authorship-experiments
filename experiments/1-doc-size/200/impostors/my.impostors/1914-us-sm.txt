— was at supper with some theatrical women; and 
one of them, not having any idea that Freddie 
knew me, proceeded to talk about me, and how 
she had met me, and where we had been together 
— about my yacht, and my castle in Scotland, and 
I don't know what all else. It seems that this 
woman had been my mistress for several years; 
she told quite glibly about me and my habits. 
Freddie got the woman's picture, on some pretext 
or other, and brought it to me; I had never laid 
eyes on her in my life. He could hardly beheve 
it, and to prove it to him I offered to meet the 
woman, under another name. We sat in a res- 
taurant, and she told the tale to Freddie and 
myself together — until finally he burst out laugh- 
ing, and told her who I was." 



 

He paused, to let this sink in. "Now, suppose 
your friend Mary Abbott had met that woman! 
I don't imagine she is particularly careful whom 
she associates with; and suppose she had come 
and told you that she knew such a woman — 
what would you have said? Can you deny that 
the tale would have made an impression on you? 
Yet I've not the least doubt there are scores of 
women who made such tales about me a part of 
their stock ia trade; there are thousands of 
women whose fortunes would be made for life if 
they could cause such a tale to be believed. 
And imagiae how well-informed they would be, 
if anyone were to ask them concerning my habits, 
and the reason why our baby is blind! I tell 
you, when the rumor concerning our child has 
begun to spread, there will be ten thousand people 
in New York City who will know of first-hand, 
personal knowledge exactly how it happened, and 
how you took it, and everything that I said to 
you about it. There will be sneers in the society- 
papers, from New York to San Francisco; and 
smooth-tongued gentlemen calling, to give us 
hints that we can stop these sneers by purchasing 
a de-luxe edition of a history of om* ancestors for 
six thousand dollars. There will be well-meaning 
and beautiful-souled people who will try to get you 
to confide in them, and then use their knowledge 
of your domestic unhappiness to blackmail you; 
there will be threats of law-suits from people who 
will claim that they have contracted a disease 
from you or yoiu" child — your laundress, perhaps, 
or your maid, or one of these nurses " 



 

"Oh, stop! stop!" she cried. 

" I am quite aware," he said, quietly, " that these 
things are not calculated to preserve the peace of 
mind of a young mother. You are horrified when 
I tell you of them — yet you clamor for the right 
to have Mrs. Abbott tell you of them ! I warn you, 
Sylvia — you have married a rich man, who is 
exposed to the attacks of cimning and unscru- 
pulous enemies. You, as his wife, are exactly 
as much exposed — possibly even more so. There- 
fore when I see you entering into what I know to 
be a dangerous intimacy, I must have the right 
to say to you. This shall stop. And I tell you, 
there can never be any safety or peace of mind 
for either of us, so long as you attempt to deny 
me that right." 



 



 

Dr. Gibson took his departirre three or four 
days later; and before he went, he came to give 
her his final blessing; talking to her, as he phrased 
it, "like a Dutch tmcle". "You must under- 
stand," he said, "I am almost old enough to be 
your grandfather. I have four sons, any one of 
whom might have married you, if they had had 
the good fortune to be in Castleman County at 
the critical time. So you must let me be frank 
with you." 

Sylvia indicated that she was willing. 

"We don't generally talk to women about these 
matters; because they've no standard by which 
to judge, and they almost always fly off and have 
hysterics. Their case seems to them exceptional 
and horrible, their husbands the blackest crinodnals 
in the whole tribe." 

He paused for a moment. "Now, Mrs. van 
Tuiver, the disease which has made yorn* baby 
blind is probably what we call gonorrhea. When 
it gets into the eyes, it has very terrible results. 
But it doesn't often get into the eyes, and for the 
most part it's a trifling affair, that we don't worry 
about. I know there are a lot of new-fangled 
notions, but I'm an old man, with experience of 
my own, and I have to have things proven to 
me. I know that with as much of this disease as 
we doctors see, if it was a deadly disease, there'd 



 

be nobody left alive in the world. As I say, I 
don't like to discuss it with women; but it was not 
I who forced the matter upon your attention " 

"Pray go on, Dr. Gibson," she said. "I really 
wish to know all that you will tell me." 

"The question has come up, how was this dis- 
ease brought to your child? Dr. Perrin suggested 
that possibly he — you imderstand his fear; and 
possibly he is correct. But it seems to me an 
illustration of the imwisdom of a physician's 
departing from his proper duty, which is to cure 
people. If you wish to find out who brought a 
disease, what you need is a detective. I know, 
of course, that there are people who can combine 
the duties of physician and detective — and that 
without any previous preparation or study of 
either profession." 

He waited for this irony to sink in; and Sylvia 
also waited, patiently. 

At last he resumed, "The idea has been planted 
in your mind that your husband brought the 
trouble; and that idea is sure to stay there and 
fester. So it becomes necessary for some one to 
talk to you straight. Let me tell you that eight 
men out of ten have had this disease at some time 
in their lives; also that very few of them were 
cured of it when they thout they were. You 
have a cold; and then next month, you say the 
cold is gone. So it is, for practical purposes. 
But if I take a microscope, I find the germs of 
the cold still in yoxir membranes, and I know 
that you can give a cold, and a bad cold, to some 



 

one else who is sensitive. It is true that you may 
go through all the rest of your life without ever 
being entirely rid of that cold. You understand 
me?" 

"Yes," said Sylvia, in a low voice. 

"I say eight out of ten. Estimates woiild 
differ. Some doctors would say seven out of ten — 
and some actual investigations have shown nine 
out of ten. And imderstand me, I don't mean 
bar-room loafers and roustabouts. I mean your 
brothers, if you have any; yoirr cousins, your 
best friends, the men who came to make love 
to you, and whom you thought of marrying. 
If you had found it out about any one of them, 
of course you'd have cut the acquaintance; yet 
you'd have been doing an injustice — for if you had 
done that to all who'd ever had the disease, you 
might as well have retired to a nunnery at once." 

The old gentleman paused again; then frowning 
at her imder his bushy eye-brows, he exclaimed, 
"I tell you, Mrs. van Tuiver, you're doing your 
husband a wrong. Your husband loves you, 
and he's a good man — I've had some talks with 
him, and I know he's not got nearly so much on 
his conscience as the average husband. I'm a 
Southern man, and I know these gay yoxmg 
bloods you've danced and flirted with all your 
young life. Do you think if you went probing 
into their secret affairs, you'd have had much 
pleasure in their company afterwards? I tell 
you again, you're doing your husband a wrong! 
You're doing something that very few men
