Send John for what you want;" said Mr. Read.--She was slipping out
through the back parlor.

"I will be gone but a second," she answered; and Mr. Read was still
telling Richard how opportune his visit was when she returned. She was
the collected, urbane hostess, only an eager glance at each arrival,
betrayed nervousness or expectation. Mr. Read watched the door, also;
and his displeasure at the tardiness of his favorite was audibly vented.

"Helen! why don't Mr. Ashlin come?" he said, in Ida's hearing. Ears
less acute would not have distinguished his wife's reply.

"Hush! these people are jealous of your preference already. He will be
here before long."

Ida had mislaid her handkerchief, or not brought it into the room; and
Richard offered to favor her retreat by a journey into the next room,
to look at some green-house plants. Leaving him bending over them, she
ran up-stairs, found the missing article, and was hurrying down, when a
ring arrested her upon the lower landing. Thinking to let the visitor
enter before her, she stepped back out of sight.

"Mr. Ashlin, I beg your pardon, sir," said John, "my mistress told me
to give you this before you went into the drawing-room, sir."

Mr. Ashlin paused--she judged, to read a note.

"All right!" said he. "Tell your mistress, I regret exceedingly that I
am called into the country, on account of a friend's danger, and cannot
comply with my engagement to Mr. Read this evening. Deliver the message
as I have given it. This is for yourself, John. Good day."

"Thank you, sir. Good afternoon."

Ida's limbs shook beneath her. She had not time to unravel the
mystery--for mystery she knew it to be;--Mrs. Read's fright at her
brother's entrance; her incoherence and exit; the strangely worded
message; the bribe to the servant--swam in a chaotic medley through her
mind. She was sick with terror, until warned to conceal her emotions
by Richard's saying that "Helen's queer symptoms had become epidemic."
Partaker of the alarms of guilt, by her knowledge of the sin,--averse
as she was to participation in its concealment, she was possessed with
the idea, that to her was committed the work of blinding Richard. While
her ears were alert to every sentence uttered around her, and she
was quaking at the least approach to a mention of the absentee, she
aimed to monopolize Mr. Copeland's sense and thoughts. She anticipated
their quitting the table as a blessed change; then a cold agony
came over her, at the remembrance that the gentlemen would remain.
Discovery, in this case, was inevitable. His wife's caution would not
restrain Mr. Read from pledging Mr. Ashlin's health. She thought of
bantering Richard into withdrawing with the ladies;--it would be too
bold--too forward. He would obey, but his respect for her would be
diminished;--as a final alternative, she must venture it--but was there
no other?

"Our patient does us credit, Miss Ida." Her next neighbor was Dr.
Ballard.

"Does you credit, Doctor. I am only your custodian--a daring one,
however, for I have a petition to submit. Will it not be imprudent
for Mr. Read to remain long at table, after the cloth is removed? His
system is still inflammatory." Her conscience reproved her for the
deception, although she spoke the truth, but the case was desperate.
The doctor's professional cap was on instantly.

"Unquestionably, my child!--unquestionably! well thought of, Miss Ida!
We must guard against a relapse. How shall we get him into the parlor?"

Ida consulted Richard, who referred the case to Charley and returned
her the reply, that if the ladies would delay their departure, a little
longer than was customary,--not to startle those who loved to tarry at
the wine, he would concert with most of the company to rise at the same
time. Charley was at the helm, and Ida could safely have slept upon
her watch. Mr. Read demurred at an infringement upon banquetting laws,
but the seceders gallantly insisted upon attending their fair leaders;
and the most disaffected had not courage to stand their ground. It was
a weary, weary evening to Ida; she looked and felt wretchedly ill,
after the guests dispersed. Richard looked in again, after saying "good
night."

"I have purchased a buggy to-day," said he, to Ida; "and my pet horse
is in town. Shall I have the pleasure of driving you out in the
morning?"

She assented.

"At what hour?" he asked.

"I wonder what has happened, that Ashlin stayed away!" said Mr. Read.

Richard started violently. "Ashlin!" he echoed with a fiery look at his
sister. "Ashlin--Ashlin;" he repeated, sensible of his imprudence. "I
have heard the name--who is he?"

"An old friend of your sister's," replied Josephine.

Richard's face was profoundly meditative. "A small man--is he not?
red-haired, stoops in the shoulders, and wears spectacles?"

Mr. Read spoke up indignantly. "A magnificent fellow! gentlemanly,
intelligent, and one of the best hearts in the world."

"I do not know him then!" said Richard, emphatically. "Now I think
of it, the red head's name may have been Ashton. Say eleven
o'clock,"--to Ida--"it will be pleasantly warm then."

"It will suit me," she rejoined, trembling before his gaze.

He was punctual to the hour. Mr. Read hobbled to the door to admire
his "turn-out." To him, Richard was lively and friendly as usual, but
he refused his sister's invitation to come in, and his bow, as his
horse sprang off at the loosened rein, was to him. They left the city
by the shortest route. Beyond the houses, Richard slackened their
headlong speed.

"Miss Ross!" he said, abruptly facing her, "I have classed you among
the limited number of your sex, who are upright and truthful. Within
twelve hours past, I have doubted you. You are under no personal
obligations to answer my questions;--but as a brother--for the honor of
my family, I demand of you, all that you know of this Ashlin."

"Which is very little. I never saw him until Mr. Cranleigh's marriage,
when he was introduced to me at Mrs. Morris'."

"By whom? by Helen?"

"By Mrs. Morris, herself. He made a party call, and has continued to
visit the house."

"Artful as ever!" he said, through his shut teeth. "Does Mrs. Read see
him?"

"Yes; and Mr. Read."

"The old blinkard! Does Helen receive him as your friend or as hers?"

"As the friend of the family."

"Tush! I might commend your diplomacy, Miss Ross, if I were not so
thoroughly in earnest. It is clear you will not advance a step, without
knowing why you are questioned. Having more confidence in you, than
you have in me, I will set you an example of candor. Ashlin and my
sister were betrothed when he was at college. We were 'chums.' He is
ardent--generous in some of his impulses, but as I perceived, even with
my boyishly irregular notions, lax in principle. Helen was not ignorant
of my opinion, and with a woman's faith and perseverance, set herself
to break it down. You do not know her as she was then--high-spirited,
proud and passionate, but tractable as a child to the voice of
affection. Her will was more ungovernable than mine, and she almost
reconciled me to her choice. He had just completed his course at the
University, when the death of an uncle put him in possession of a
valuable estate in Cuba. The marriage, which was to have taken place
immediately, was postponed for twelve months. Meantime, he was to
visit his property, and prepare for a permanent residence in the
West Indies. The year elapsed--he did not return--and suddenly his
letters were suspended. Helen was insanely trustful; he might be ill
or dead--dying, or in the grave, he was true! Her romantic independent
disposition led her to the formation of a mad project--to search for
him in person, since she could learn nothing in any other way. I
could not dissuade her;--she made but one concession,--that I might
accompany her. The object and direction of our expedition was known
only to ourselves. We were ready--a day before that fixed for starting,
a letter came! He was enamored of an Italian cantatrice; 'designed
marrying her, if Helen would liberate him;--if not, he would redeem his
early pledge to her.' She was ill for weeks; and upon what, I believed
was her death-bed, she extorted from me a vow not to revenge her. She
'should have foreseen how it would end,' she said, 'blind, confiding
dupe, that she was!' She arose--a hardened, I think, sometimes, a
heartless woman of the world:--with her trust in him, had perished her
faith in God and man; an unfeminine panting for wealth and distinction
filling its place. Chance threw this gold-fish, Read, in her net; and
she clutched him. I had sorrowed for, and commiserated her until then;
but so sordid, so wickedly weak was this act, that I reproached her
angrily. I said it sprang from wounded vanity, and a mean desire to
glitter, a hollow-hearted, tinselled doll in the view of those who
would gibe, while pretending to applaud;--that her conduct was as
degrading to her, as mortifying to us,--and she bore my vituperations,
without attempting to defend herself, 'Richard!' she said, when I
had exhausted my indignation, 'better reason with a tornado, than a
slighted woman!'

"You regard me as a chattering coxcomb, Miss Ida; but I solemnly
declare that I could have gone to the block more resignedly, than
I saw my beautiful sister sold to her hoary bridegroom. These were
circumstances, with which I could not cope--but the diabolical schemes
of this assassin of her peace shall not mature! This is the sad
tale--is it quite new to you?"

"In its details;" and she related Celestia's version.

"Which furnished you with a key--you have a clear head, and a woman's
wit--have you found no locks that it fitted?"

No reply.

"Did you divine the cause of Helen's embarrassment at my appearance,
yesterday?"

"Not at the time."
