were going to do with the dinner you brought me ? " 

" No, I went to the store room, and got it. She 
didn't see me ; but I don't like to do any thing un- 
known to her." 

" You mustn't do it again." 

" You must have something to eat." 

'* You have brought enough to last me while I
itop here. To-morrow morning I must start ; so I 
suppose I shall not see you again. But I shall never 
forget you," said Harry, locking as sad as he felt. 

" Xo, you mustn't go off without any breakfast. 
Promise me you will not go till I have brought yon 
some." 





Harry assured Julia he had enough, and ried Ifi 
persuade her not to bring him any more food ; bu« 
Julia was resolute, and he was obliged to promise 
Having finished his dinner, she gathered up the rem- 
nants of the feast, and put them in the cabin for hia 
supper. She was afraid to remain any longer, lest 
she might be missed at home ; and Harry gallantly 
escorted her beyond the brook on her return home. 

He busied himself during the greater part of the 
afternoon in gathering dry grass and dead leaves for 
the improvement of his bed in the cabin. About an 
hour before sundown, he was surprised to receive 
another visit from Julia Bryant. She had her little 
basket in one hand, and in the other she carried a 
little package. 

" I didn't expect to see you again," said Harry, as 
she approached. 

" I don't know as you will like what I have done," 
shfi began, timidly ; " but I did it for the best." 

" I shall like any thing that you have done," an- 
swered Harry, promptly, " even if you should send 
mo back to lledfield." 

" I wouldn't do such a mean thing as that ; but I
have told somebody that you are here." 





" Huve you ? " asked Harry, not a little alarmed. 

" You will forgive me if I have done wrong —  
won t you: 

Harry looked at her. He mistook her anxious 
appearance for sorrow at what she had done. He 
could not give her pain ; so he told her that, what- 
ever she had done, she was forgiven. 

" But vchom have you told." 

" John Lane." 

"Who is he?" 

" Mrs. Lane's oldest son. He drives the baggage 
«iigon that goes to Boston every week. He prom- 
ted not to lisp a word to a single soul, and that he 
^ould be your friend for my sake." 

" Why did you tell him?" 

" Well, you see, I was afraid you would never get 
to Boston; and I thought what a nice thing it would 
be if you could only ride all the way there with John 
Lane. John likes me because I carry things to hia 
mother, and I am sure he won't tell." 

" How good you are, Julia!" exclaimed lL.rry, 
" may forget every body else in the wjrld; bat I 
shall never forgot you." 



£

A tear moistened his eye, as he uttered his enthu- 
iiastic declaration. 

'* The worst of it is, John starts at two o'clock— 
right in the middle of the night." 

" So much the better," replied Harr) r , wiping iviay 
the tear. 

" You will take the wagon on the turnpike, whew 
the cart path comes out. P-ii you won't- wake up." 

" Yes, I shall." 

" I am sorry to have yo^ go ; for I like you, 
Harry. You will be a very good boy, when you gel 
to Boston ; for they say the city is a wicked place." 

" I will try." 

" There are a great many temptations there, peopl* 
say." 

" I shall try to be as good as you are," replied 
Harry, who could imagine nothing better. " If I 
fail once, I shall try again." 

" Here, Harry, I have brought you a good book — - 
the best of all books. I have written your name 
and mine in it ; and I hope you will keep it and read 
it as long as you live. It is the Bible." 

Harry took the package, and thanked her for it 



"I never read the Bible much; but I shall lead 
this for your sake." 

" No, Harry ; read it for your own sake." 

" I will, Julia." 

" How I shall long to hear from you ! John Lane 
goes to Boston every week. Won't you write me 
a few lines, now and then, to let me know how you 
prosper, and whether you are good or not ? " 

" I will. I can't write much ; but I suppose I 
can " 

*' Never mind how you write it, if I can only 
read it." 

The sun had gone down, and the dark shadows 
of night were gathering over the forest when they 
parted, but a short distance from Mr. Bryant's house. 
With the basket which contained provisions for  his 
journey and the Bible in his hand, he returned to 
the hut, to get what sleep he might before the wagon 
ttarted. 






CHAPTER XI. 

IK WHICH HARRY REACHES THE CUT, AND THOUGH 
OFTEN DISAPPOINTED, TRIES AGAIN. 

Harry entered the cabin, and stretched himself 
on his bed of straw and leaves ; but the fear that he 
should not wake in season to take the wagon at the 
appointed place, would scarcely permit him to close 
his eyes. He had not yet made up for the sleep he 
had lost ; and Nature, not sharing his misgiving, at 
last closed and sealed his eyelids. 

It would be presumptuous for me to attempt to 
inform the reader what Harry dreamed about on that 
eventful night ; but I can guess that it was about 
angels, about bright faces and sweet smiles, ard that 
they were very pleasant dreams. At any rate, ha 
slspt very soundly, as tired boys are apt to sleep, 
even when they arc anxious about gt tting up earl} 
in the morning. 





He woke, at last, with a start ; for with his first 
consciousness came the remembrance of the early 
\ppointment. He sprang from his bed, and threw 
down the door of the cabin. It was still dark ; the 
stars twinkled above, the owls screamed, and the 
frogs sang merrily around him. He had no means 
of ascertaining the time of night. It might be 
twelve ; it might be four ; and his uncertainty on 
this point filled him with anxiety. Better to < early 
than too late ; and grasping the basket and thr Bible, 
which were to be the companions of his journey, he 
hastened down the cart path to the turnpike.
