bom of Mrs. Donaldson's mischievous impression, flashes 
up to the surface. He has not come a moment too soon. 
He feels that it is his right and duty to guard this woman, 
as a brother might, from the dangers this unlucky inherit- 
ance has thrown in her way. It is hardly likely either 
of them understand the peril, and he knows Donaldson 
too well to suppose he would rush into it blindly, but some 
of the greatest miseries of life have come from this fatal 
lack of sight until it was too late. 

It is quite safe to begin about the play, and St. George 
makes an effort to restore the usual friendly feeling. 
Miss Ormiston responds readily ; she desires a change of 
mood, and she has felt a little disappointed at not finding 





him with Donaldson in the first instance, for of late he 
has always been in the. counting-room. Donaldson is 
secretly annoyed, and Ms fine cheerfulness deserts him; 
he is coldly ungracious, but it is simply because he cannot 
forgive his friend this wretched blunder, and just now, he 
recognizes that he cannot make the merciless onslaught 
that would restore his composure. 

Miss Ormiston breaks the silence that is as inharmoni- 
ous as the worst discord. 

" Isn't this a new order?" she inquires, holding up the 
slip. 

" Tes, I was going to speak of it.'' He is at home 
again, the business man. " Look at the references ; there 
is only one we know. I was in some doubt." 

" A new house ? " inquired St. George. " Let me see." 
Miss Ormiston hands the paper oyer to him. 

"This Herrick is a man of the highest integrity. He 
would not recommend any one he did not know well." 

"Thoresley, ditto," appends Donaldson. " Had it 
been an order for half the amount, I should have risked 
it at once. We are not likely to have much idle time by 
present indications. I hope everything wHl not fall flat 
as autumn comes on." 

" Well," says St. George, rather gayly, " you are in 
excellent shape this time, if it should come." Christmas 
Ormiston rises. " With your permission I will go up 
to the Glen," he announces, " and pay my respects to 
the ' star of the goodly company.' " 

" Some friend who has Miss Allaire's best interests at 
heart ought to advise her to take to acting in earnest, 
exclaims Donaldson. " Women of fashion and pleasure 
generally develop an incapacity for being of any earthly 
use in this world, but she might arouse a certain admira- 
tion that would be equal to fame. I never saw an ama« 
teur more at home on the boards." 

A flush stains St. George's delicate face, but he makes 



no reply. Donaldson is too really angry to detain him by 
any sabterfnge. Indeed, he almost hopes, in a half -say- 
age way, that he may come to know a man's deep, 
exhaustless love for Christmas Ormiston, and writhe in 
the evil bonds wherewith he has bound himself. 

They take the longest way, because it is shady and there 
need be no hurry; Dolly will not be up until noon, if 
then. Nothing more is said of the play or the evening ; 
it seems to both an unwholesome subject, seen in this peer- 
less morning atmosphere. Floating drifts of gossamer 
sail in the blue above their heads tending to some magic 
country. The air is warm and golden, and sweet with the 
spice of orchards and suggestions of wild grape. There 
are intense and tender contrasts of color ; the ledges of 
rock are already donning the reddish-brown hue of sun- 
dried furze, but here and there from a shady hollow, where 
the water trickles through at every shower, shoots out a 
branching frond of fern in its deepest green. The blue 
green of the firs and spruce, the yellowish tint of dwarf 
cedars, the glossy oaks and sienna-brown shrubs meet and 
mingle and are full of shifting lights. Now and then a 
bright-eyed squirrel peers out, or flies up some steep with 
his store, and but for this, they might be in perfect soli- 
tude. 

If there has been any suggestion or counsel in his mind, 
he does not utter it. He cannot startle that serene and 
impassioned womanhood with the awful earnest of danger, 
nor vex it with worldly, narrow platitudes. Can she not 
move as safely through this apparent peril as women do 
through the lurid fires society allows to be lighted? If 
she is cold, so much the better for her own work in life ; 
but he knows he has misread her, and under the calm ex- 
terior lie summer seas no man has fathomed, that perhaps 
no man ever will. If her growth has been slow, it is not 
lacking in richness and strength ; there is no mental pau- 
city, and as little dominant boldness. Society has not 



 



 





made her what she is ; it has been her ardent communing 
with nature, and her sympathy with all of the finer forms 
of excellence. 

There is one curious episode before the drive ends. 
Just as they are turning down the gentle sweep of road, a 
man suddenly emerges from the Glen. His dress and air 
are that of extreme fashion, but not foppishness. He is 
tall, rather slender, compact and well rounded, with a flow- 
ing grace in every motion ; and what is more rare, the pose, 
as he suddenly pauses, is grace itself. The face under the 
summer hat of yellow straw is certainly handsome, with a 
rather long black mustache, silken and curling, a cleft 
chin, a slender nose inclining to aquiline. He glances at 
them with a frank sort of passing curiosity, far removed 
from impertinence. 

" What a handsome face ! " St. Greorge exclaims invol- 
untarily ; then a movement on his companion's part, under- 
stood rather than seen, startles him, — a sudden shiver that 
runs down to her very finger-ends. 

She gives a short, nervous laugh as she raises her eyes, 
amazed at the impression herself. 

" What is the old superstition about some one walking 
over your grave ? " she asks. 

" Did you know the man? " 

" I have seen him in some other life," she makes an- 
swer, '' some remote existence, and yet I am sure I should 
remember the tones of his voice." 

"Do you not believe these vague impressions are 
about people we really have seen, but for such a brief 
while that they pass out of our minds? " 

" It may be." 

They go down the hill and turn into the drive. Dolly's 
shutters are still tightly closed, yet Miss Ormiston asks 
him in, and he follows her with his leisurely grace. 

Mrs. Byrne comes out into the hall. 

" There was a gentleman here ten minutes ago," she an- 



 



 



 

noonces, glancing at the great dock, " and he wiahed tofind 
Mr. St. Greorge. He had been at Cliff HooBe and yonr 
lodgings," she continues, taming to him, "and I begged 
him to wait nntil Miss Ormiston returned, when we should 
likely hear about you, if you did not accompany her.'' 
Christmas smiles brightly at her guest. " He is to return 
in Just half an hour." 

" How fortunate you came in, though I knew Ddly 
would not be visible," says Miss Ormiston. 

" I wonder if it is your business or mine? " he inquires 
with an odd expression. 

" When he comes I will leave him to yon ; I shall not 
run the risk of dismal reminders again." But she sits 
chatting until they see the graceful figure they both 
recognize, when she flits indoors and upstairs for a change 
of apparel. The greeting reaches her, it is surely some 
old acquaintance, and then they settle to a talk, in which 
there is earnest persuasion on the stranger's part and in- 
difference on that of St. Greorge. The moments go on,
