“This? ‘Received of Charles Gas-pill-er!’” said she, reading just what
the letters of my new name spelled.

How stupid I was! Why had I not told her in so many words, that we were
to go, instead of doing the thing in this sensational way?

“Precisely so; that is the French for Glasswood,” I replied, laughing
as gaily as my confusion would permit. “I don’t want Frenchmen in Paris
to call me Bois de Verre, which means wood made of glass, or anything
of that sort. The name is Gas-pee-ay, and not Gas-pill-er.”

“But how does it happen that the receipt is given to you under this
name?”

“Because I don’t want to be called Glasswood in Europe. But, my dear,
we have no time to spare now, and we shall have ten days of idleness
as soon as the steamer sails. So we must not stop to discuss this
matter at the present time. We must be on board at half-past twelve,
and it is after eleven now,” I continued, with sufficient excitement in
my manner to change the current of her thoughts.

“Then we are really going!” exclaimed she, opening her bright eyes.

“Certainly we are; and going immediately.”

“Why, I wanted to go shopping in New York, if we were really going.”

“Shopping! That’s absurd! Ladies never go shopping in New York, when
they are on their way to Paris.”

“But I must write a letter to mother.”

“Certainly; you have time to do that while I speak for a carriage and
pay the bill.”

I procured note paper and envelopes for her, and went down to settle my
account at the office. The polite book-keeper asked me to indicate the
name on the register. I told him I had not written it. I had wound my
handkerchief around my right hand, which I held up to him, and declared
that I was unable to use a pen. He was kind enough to offer to render
me the service himself.

“C. Gaspiller,” I added, when he was ready to write.

“What is it, sir?”

“C. Gaspiller.”

He wrote “C. Caspeare,” and I was entirely satisfied.

“Three dollars, Mr. Caspeare,” said he; and I gave him the amount,
though it was one dollar more than the regular charge.

I was confident that I was leaving no trace of myself here. A carriage
was ordered for me, and my trunks were loaded. I went up for Lilian,
and found that she had finished her letter. She gave it to me to be
stamped and mailed. I took a stamp from my porte-monnaie, carefully
adjusted it upon the envelope, and put the letter in my pocket. Of
course I was not stupid enough to mail it, since it would betray my
secret to those who could not see the necessity of keeping it.

“This is very sudden, Paley,” said Lilian, as the carriage drove off.

“Sudden? Why, I told you this was the way it would have to be done, if
it was done at all,” I replied.

“I know you did. Won’t dear ma be astonished when she reads my letter?”

“Probably she will be,” I answered; but I thought she would be
astonished, long before she read it.

I confess that my conscience reproached me when I thought of the letter
in my pocket, and of the deception towards my wife, of which I was
guilty. Her father, mother and sisters would wonder, and be permitted
to wonder, for weeks if not for months, that they did not hear from
her. It was cruel for me to deceive Lilian, and to subject her family
to all the anxiety to which I thus doomed them, but I believed that it
was a stern necessity, and I silenced the upbraidings of the inward
monitor. With thirty thousand dollars of stolen money in my pocket,
it may be supposed that I did not trouble myself much upon such an
insignificant matter as the peace of my wife’s friends.

We went on board of the steamer and I found our state-room. Being one
of the last engaged, it was not the best on board, though it was a very
comfortable one. Lilian was delighted with it, and declared that she
should be as happy as a queen in it. I was afraid she was mistaken. She
had never traveled any except on our bridal tour, and I expected she
would be sea-sick all the way. But now she was excited by the prospect
before her, and by the busy scene which surrounded us. The steamer was
crowded with those who were going, and with their friends who had come
to see them off. There was no one to say adieu to Lilian or to me.

If, of the multitude on the wharf, there was any one who felt an
interest in me, it could only be a detective. I was a fugitive, and I
felt like one. While Lilian was full of life and animated by the scene,
I could not help feeling depressed. I was bidding farewell to my native
land, perhaps forever. It might never be safe for me to return. I could
not get rid of a certain sense of insecurity. It seemed to me, after
I saw the men casting off the huge hawsers that held the ship to the
pier, that those infernal detectives must come on board and hurry me
back to a prison cell in the city from which I had fled.

Any flurry in the crowd, the arrival of a belated passenger, gave me
a pang of anxiety which I cannot describe. It was only when the huge
steamer was clear of the dock, and the great wheels began to turn, that
I dared to breathe in a natural manner. Even then I was thrown into
a fresh agony, when a steam-tug came out to us to put the mails on
board. I was sure, until it was alongside, that it had been specially
chartered by the detectives to arrest me. I was determined to jump
overboard and perish in the waves, in sight of my wife, rather than be
borne back to a long term of imprisonment in a dungeon. It was better
to die than confront my friends in Boston.

I asked one of the officers what the tug was, as she came alongside,
that I need not be tempted to do a deed for which there was no real
necessity. He assured me it contained only the mails, and I breathed
easier; but I was not entirely satisfied that the officers had not
availed themselves of this last opportunity to arrest their victim,
until the tug had cast off, and the steamer started on her long voyage.
I was safe then. My throbbing heart returned to its natural pulsations.

But I could not forget the ruin and disgrace which would soon cover my
name and fame in Boston. I could not shut out from my view the horror
of my mother when she learned that I was a fugitive from justice, and
that I had mocked her fondest hopes. I was miserable for the time,
and Lilian rallied me upon my gloomy appearance. There was a remedy
which I had tried before for this mental suffering. Leaving my wife
for a moment, I went down to the steward’s room, and drank a glass of
whiskey. I found that lunch was on the table, and I conducted Lilian to
the saloon. I ordered a bottle of sherry, and a few glasses of this,
in addition to what I had already taken, soon gave my reproaches of
conscience to the winds for the time.

I do not intend to describe our voyage. It was an unusually pleasant
one, and Lilian suffered but very little from sea-sickness. In a few
days, as the distance from my native land increased, I felt tolerably
secure from the consequences of my crime; but I found it impossible to
get rid of the thought of my mother and other friends at home. Even
whiskey and wine soon failed to stupefy me unless I partook of them in
inordinate quantities. Lilian told me I drank too much, and begged me
not to do so any more. She was so gentle and so tender that I could not
refuse, for I had not acquired a decided appetite for the intoxicating
cup. I only drank it for the solace it afforded me, and I was fully
convinced that the severe headaches and the disordered stomach which
troubled me were the effects of this excess. I would gladly refrain,
but there was “no peace for the wicked.”

I will not attempt to describe my sufferings, though I appeared
cheerful and happy to my wife. I could not wholly conceal them from
her, and she worried me with her questions, anxious to know what ailed
me. We arrived at Liverpool and hastened on to London, for I wished to
cash my bill before it was possible for anything to go wrong. I had
no trouble in doing so. My signature had already reached the bankers,
having come out in the same steamer with me. With the gold which I
had brought, I had four thousand five hundred pounds. To prevent
any trace being had of me, I went to another banker and purchased a
circular letter of credit for a thousand pounds, investing the rest in
securities which paid me about five per cent.

We spent a month in London, seeing the sights, and Lilian was as happy
as a woman could be. I had satisfied her that the change of name was
purely a matter of convenience, and she soon became accustomed to it.
She wrote letters to her mother and other friends, and gave them to me
to be mailed. I lighted my cigar with them. We had rooms at Morley’s,
but we saw no one, knew no one in the house, except the servants. One
day, after dinner, I went out to obtain some tickets to visit Windsor
castle, leaving Lilian in the room. When I came back I found her in
terrible excitement. She had a Boston newspaper in her hand, which the
landlord, as a special favor, had sent up to our apartments.

“O Charles—Paley!” said she; and I saw that she had been weeping.
“What does this mean?”

“What, my dear?” I asked, appalled at the tempest which was rising.

“This paper says there is a rumor of a defalcation in the Forty-Ninth
National Bank, and that the paying teller has disappeared. Were not you
the paying teller, Paley?”

She suddenly ceased to call me Charles, as I had instructed her to
do. Evidently she knew more than I wished her to know. I took the
newspaper. It was dated about a week after our departure from Boston.
The paragraph said it was rumored that there was a heavy defalcation in
the Forty-Ninth. The paying teller had been missing for a week. That
was all. It was merely an item which some industrious reporter had
picked up; and the particulars had not yet been published. Doubtless
the detectives were looking for me.

With tears in her eyes Lilian again demanded an explanation of the
paragraph. What could I say?
