Sylvie would sit beside him and listen, a fascinated 
auditor. Her slim hand would rest on his knee, some- 
times to be clasped by his, which was still soft. It was 
delightful to have a new listener. 

“But were they really charms?” the child queried. 
“Could they wish for things and have them come to pass ? 
And did they hear their lovers’ names truly called on 
St. John’s night ?” 

“They thought so. There was an old -slave woman 





that was devoted to my papa who had a curious amulet. 
She herself had come from Africa. She had only to 
rub it and wish for some one and he was sure to come. 
She had a lover, and one night she wanted to go to a 
dance ; so she wished for him. But the drawback was 
that the person you wished for must never be across 
water. The poor lover was, and in trying to cross the 
river he was drowned.” 

'‘Oh, how could she have forgotten !” 

“She might not have known where he was,” said 
Angelique. 

“But the amulet, what did she do with that?” ques- 
tioned Sylvie, eagerly. 

Monsieur Fleurien smiled a little. 

“I wanted her to give it to me, but one day she went 
out and dropped it in the river. And shortly afterward 
she died.” 

“And there is the story of the ring that makes one 
invisible, and ever so many legends.” 

“I wish I had it,” said Sylvie, eagerly. “I would wish 
at once for Gervaise. It is getting to be very lonesome 
without him.” 

“But he might be across water.” 

“Oh, dear! Why, you couldn't always be certain.” 

“There are so many superstitions among the slaves,” 
said Claire. “And some really horrible Voudoux things. 
Then there are the children -born with a caul or a thin 
membrane over the head and face. The child can see 
into futurity and tell fortunes.” 

“And a sea captain will sometimes pay a big price for 
the caul,” exclaimed M. Fleurien, “as he thinks no bad 
luck will happen to him while it is on board. So the 
superstitions are not all confined to the blacks.” 

“And all the foolish signs the girls have in the convent,” 





laughed Claire. '‘But I wore a yellow garter and found 
a lover,” she added, triumphantly. ”And we used to cut 
our nails on Monday morning before breakfast to get a 
present.” 

“And did you get the present?” asked Sylvie, all 
interest. 

“Well, we often forgot to do it, eager as we were for 
the present. Yes, we surely did sometimes.” 

“And the old women in the city who sell love powders 
and charms !” 

“All nations have much the same superstitions,” said 
the host with his good night. “Little one, do not spend 
any time dreaming, but sleep sweetly.” 

There was the great red brick structure with its 
furnaces and chimneys, its long sheds where rows of 
hogsheads were like bristling fortifications. The new 
methods with the sacharometer and polariscope and 
other modern ideas had not come in yet. M. de 
Bore’s methods led on to fortune in those days and 
were satisfactory. And the crowds of half-clad negroes 
looking weird enough in the atmosphere of steam, dip- 
ping from kettle to kettle until the overseer discerns the 
sparkling grains, and then the shout of triumph. Every 
day apparently the same anxiety, the same rejoicing. 

Then came the message that Monsieur Poydras would 
be pleased to receive them. Eugene heroically insisted 
that his father should attend the ladies, as one of them 
must remain on the plantation for authority. 

The slaves rowed them down, keeping time with 
musical notes that had no real words to them, only 
sounds. And there was their host to receive them. 
At this period he was about sixty, tall and still finely 
formed, like a man in the prime of life, and attired in the 
quaint French costume he never changed. A pleasing 





face, rather grave, but a most kindly, cheerful voice, and 
he gave the visitors a cordial greeting, for every one was 
welcome when he was at home. 

In this simple, unostentatious house and fashion lived 
one of the wealthiest men of his time, leading a most 
kindly and beneficent life, beloved by all who had ever 
dealt with him, and adored by his slaves. Wife and 
children were not among his earthly possessions; yet in 
his earlier days, when he had gone from plantation to 
plantation with his wares, children had run to greet him, 
and mothers had been delighted to receive him as a 
welcome guest. And now society paid him all the honor 
he would accept, and although he did not mingle largely 
in it, he was no recluse. Indeed, later on, when he had 
reached the age of seventy, he was elected a delegate to 
Congress from the Territory of Orleans, and took the 
long journey on horseback with a favorite servant. 

He also had a love for the accomplishments of the time. 
He was a fine performer on the old-fashioned lyre, and 
sang his own songs, often the heroic deeds of the early 
explorers, and found time to write poetry. If it was a 
little pompous and stilted, that was the tenor of the time, 
in which heroes were likened to those of mythology. 

He remembered at once that he had seen Mam’selle 
Saucier and the little one at one of the entertainments of 
the exiled Princes and greeted them with pleasure. 

‘T remarked your perfect accent,” he said. “We get 
our language so mixed up that it is a delight to hear one’s 
native tongue in its early elegance. For one can never 
quite resign the country of his childhood. It is still my 
dream to visit it again, though I have much affection for 
the land of my adoption, yet I hope to see it some day. 
Little one, why dost thou look incredulous ?” 

“Are you not afraid of the big ocean?” 




He smiled. ,“Why our river has nearly as much terror 
in its bosom. It is sleepy enough in these tranquil times, 
but in its stormy fury quite a giant. Hardly a year but 
some place is swept away. More than once the city has 
been inundated. Some day, perhaps, there will be suf- 
ficient wisdom to protect us and to manage it. Ah, how 
magnificent it must have looked to those early travellers 
with its great reaches of unbroken forests, its myriads 
of birds, its beautiful creatures that were wild vet not 
afraid, the glow and brilliance of its sunrise and sunset. 
From St. Louis down to the Gulf, and then across the 
Gulf — it is all a marvellous country! Yet one dreams 
occasionally of the other far side — but one would not 
wish to see the storm and terror that have fallen upon it.” 

The grave eyes had so much soul in them that 
Angelique felt he was a poet, though her intellectual 
knowledge was extremely limited. 

‘T am so glad we came away,” said Sylvie proudly. 
“And I do not mean ever to go back. I do not know but 
two or three people in all France, and they may be dead; 
but there are so many delightful folks here, and it is so 
amusing to go down in the town and see all the strange 
sights and the little black children tumbling about ready 
to make any funny antics for you if you only smile on 
them. And every flower-covered house, almost it seems 
like a great garden.” 

“Ah, what a happy light youth lends ! Child, keep 
these eyes that can see so much joy as long as you can.” 

“I shall keep them always.” She raised them in their 
azure softness. “I want to be merry and glad all the days 
of my life.” 

“I think thou wilt be.” 

She was like a bird darting hither and thither. Claire 
was vivacious as well, and was quite at home in the old
