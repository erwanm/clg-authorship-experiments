jes’ want to die an’ be put in the ground. I wisht I could be laid
’long-side of her, an’ I’d stretch out my arms, an’ she’d come creepin’
to them, jes’ as she used. She’d know how to find me. An’ when you come
back you can’t see her no more. Oh, ’f we only could ’a’ started that
day! An’ mammy burned up Christiana an’ my beautiful picture, so I’m all
alone. There ain’t nothin’ left,” and she sighed drearily.

Where was he? “’Crost the ’Lantic Oshin,” as Bess had said. She had no
more idea of the Atlantic Ocean than she had of the location of heaven;
not as much, for it seemed as if heaven might be over beyond the setting
sun. But John Travis was still in the world. And as she sat there it
seemed as if she must live to tell him about Bess, and an aim brightened
her dreary life. Two months and a little more. She would come over often
when the weather grew pleasanter. Already she began to feel better.

But she could not take the heartfelt glow back to Barker’s Court. The
loneliness settled down like a pall. The long, long evenings were
intolerable. Sometimes she crept down and spent an hour with Mrs. Minch;
but she was afraid her mother might come home inopportunely.

Mrs. Quinn was growing much worse in her habits; and she lost her best
place, which did not improve her temper. Dil’s apathetic manner angered
her as well; yet the house was kept cleaner than ever, her mother’s
clothes were always in order, and there was nothing to find fault about,
except the lack of babies, which Dil could not help.

One night in February there was quite a carouse at Mrs. MacBride’s. It
was midnight when Mrs. Quinn returned. Poor Dil should have been in bed,
out of harm’s way; but she had been living over that fateful night,
believing with the purest and most passionate fervor that she might have
called Bess back to life if she could have gone to her.

A man helped Mrs. Quinn up the stairs, and tumbled her in the door. Dil
sprang up in affright.

Mrs. Quinn stared at Dil with bleared eyes.

“What yer doin’ up this time o’ night? Yees do be enough to set wan
crazy wid yer mewlin’, pinched-up mug that’s humbly as a stun! Why d’n’
ye laugh an’ hev a good time, an’ make the house decent, stead er like a
grave? I’m not goin’ to stan’ it—d’y hear?”

Dil glanced about in alarm, and would have fled to her room, but her
mother caught her by the arm.

“Come,” she cried, “I’ll shake the glumness outen yer. Why, ye’d spile
vinegar even! I’ll tache ye a little friskiness.”

Dil struggled to free herself, but uttered no word.

“I’ll tache ye!” she shouted, the devil put into her by rum driving her
to fury. “Ye measlin’, grouty little thing! forever moanin’ an’ cryin’
fer the sickly brat that’s gone, good riddance to her! Come, now, step
up lively. We’ll make a night of it, an’ ye shall hev a sup o’ gin to
wet yer t’roat whin ye get warm.”

She whirled Dil about savagely, until she was dizzy and faint, and broke
away in desperation. But her mother clutched her again, and gave her a
resounding box on the ear. She managed, as she was whirled round, to
open the door into the hall, and scream with all the strength she could
summon. Her mother seized her again with a dreadful imprecation. What
happened, how it happened in the dark, Dil could never clearly remember.

Fred Minch sprang up and opened the door. Something bumped down the
stairs, and lay in a heap at his feet.

“It’s that poor little girl, mother. She’s bleeding, killed maybe. I’ll
run for a policeman.”

Mrs. Minch picked up the senseless child. Mrs. Quinn went on yelling,
swearing, smashing things, and dancing like a mad woman.

Rows were no uncommon thing in the court. Windows were thrown up. Who
was it? Some wretched wife being beaten? And when they found it was Mrs.
Quinn, they shook their heads. She had been going to the dogs of late,
it was plain to see.

When the officer came, she made such a vigorous onslaught that he was
forced to call assistance. She was after Owen now, and Dil had hidden
him. The threats she uttered were enough to make one shudder. They
mastered her at length, and dragged her down-stairs, where Mrs. Minch
was waiting to explain poor Dil’s plight.

She was still unconscious when the ambulance came. There was a bad cut
up in the edge of her hair, but no bones seemed to be broken that any
one could discover.

“Poor child!” said Mrs. Minch, when quiet was restored. “It would be a
blessing if she could go with Bess. She’ll never get over the loss.
She’s not been the same since, and many a day my heart’s ached for her.”

“She were a nice smart woman, that Mrs. Quinn, if she’d a let rum
alone,” was the general verdict. “An’ though she took the child’s death
in a sensible manner, it broke her all up,” said some of the court
people, “and she went to hard drinking at once.”

When Mrs. Quinn’s trial came on, Dil’s life was still hanging in a
doubtful balance. She was sent to the Island for ninety days, for
drunkenness and assaulting the policeman, and would there await the
final result.

But Mrs. MacBride went on adding to her bank account and her real
estate, to the wreck of youth and womanhood, to the prisons and paupers’
graves. She kept such a very respectable place, the law never meddled
with her.

Dilsey Quinn lay on her hospital pallet delirious, but never violent,
and lapsing into unconsciousness. She had a dislocated shoulder, two
broken ribs, and sundry bruises; but it was the years of hard work, foul
air, dark rooms, and unsanitary conditions that the doctors had to fight
against blindly. Her bruised and swollen face, her stubby, red-brown
hair that had been cut short, her wide mouth and short nose, made no
appeal in the name of beauty. She was merely a “case.”

Her nurse was a youngish, kindly woman, used to such incidents. Beaten
wives and children were often sent to her ward. In the early part of her
experience she had suffered with them. Now she had grown—not
unsympathetic, but wiser; tender she would always be.

Now and then there was something so wistful in the child’s eyes that it
touched her heart. She lay so patient and uncomplaining, she made so
little trouble.

But sometimes the woman wondered why they were brought into the world to
suffer, starve, and die. What wise purpose was served?




XI—WHEN HE AND SUMMER COMES


One morning Dilsey Quinn looked slowly and curiously around the ward,
and then asked the nurse how she came there.

She lay a long while, piecing out the story, remembering what was back
of it.

“As you did not die, your mother will come out of the Island early in
June. I suppose it was a sort of accident. Was she used to beating you?”

A flush went over the pallid face.

“No,” she replied quietly.

“Do you want to go back to her?”

“O, no, no!” with a note of terror in the voice. “I couldn’t live with
her no more.”

“Have you any friends?”

There was a hesitating look, but the child did not answer. Had she any
friend? Yes, Patsey.

“How would you like to go to some of the Homes? You would be well
treated and taught some trade,” the nurse ventured kindly.

“I can work for myself,” returned Dil, with quiet decision. “I can keep
house, an’ tend babies, an’ wash an’ iron.”

“Would you like a nice place in the country?”

“I want to stay in the city,” she said slowly. “There’s some one I want
to see. It’s ’bout my little sister that’s dead. I can soon get some
work.”

“How old are you?”

“I shall be fifteen long in the summer, a spell after Fourth of July.”

“You are very small. Are you quite sure?”

“Oh, yes. Why, you see, I was fourteen last summer. Jack was next to me.
Then Bess. She was ’leven, but she hadn’t grown any ’cause she was
hurted.”

“Hurt? How?” the nurse asked with interest. The children told their
stories so simply.

“Along o’ father’s bein’ nawful drunk an’ slammin’ her agin the wall. He
went to prison ’cause he most killed a man. Bess died just before
Christmas. We was goin’—”

Dil paused. Would nurse know anything about a journey to heaven?

“Were you going to run away? But if the poor little girl was hurt, she
is better off. God is taking care of her in heaven.”

“Oh, no. She isn’t there. She’s just dead. We was goin’ together in the
spring, and—and some one was going with us who knew all ’bout the way.”

“My child, what do you know about heaven?” asked the nurse, struck by
the confident tone.

“I didn’t know—much. I heard ’bout it at the Mission School, and told
Bess. We wanted to go like Christiana. We met a man in the square last
summer, an’ he told us ’bout his Lord Jesus, that he could cure little
hurted legs that hadn’t ever grown any and couldn’t walk. An’ he
promised to go to heaven with us. We was goin’ to start then, but we
