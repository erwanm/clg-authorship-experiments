"I don't think it does," replied Paul.

"The State of Massachusetts, for instance, or the State of Ohio, makes
laws against games of chance. Why not make a law, if a man gambles, that
all his money shall be taken from him?"

"The state has no right to make such a law, I suppose."

"But the principal goes a long reach beyond that. He takes every man's
money away from him, whether he is accused of gambling or not. Do you
think he had any right to do that?"

"He hasn't made any law; but if you want law, I'll give you some!"
laughed Paul, who was disposed to treat the subject very good-naturedly,
especially as there was so much loose indignation floating about the
decks.

"I don't mean law alone, but justice," added Shuffles. "I call it
high-handed injustice to take the fellows' money away from them."

"Let me give you a little law, then," persisted Paul. "How old are you,
Shuffles?"

"Eighteen."

"Good! You are an infant."

"In law, I am."

"Suppose your uncle, or somebody else, should die to-day, and leave you
fifty thousand dollars: wouldn't you have a good time with it?"

"I should, as soon as I got hold of it, you had better believe," replied
Shuffles.

"As soon as you got hold of it!" exclaimed Paul.

"I suppose I should have a guardian till I became of age."

"Who would appoint your guardian?"

"The court, I believe."

"Exactly so! The law! What, take your money away from you, or not let
you touch it!"

"That's law, certainly."

"Well, wouldn't the law have just as much right to take off a fellow's
head, as to take his money?" demanded Paul, triumphantly.

"Mr. Lowington is not our guardian."

"Yes, he is, for the time being; and I hold that he has just as much
right to take your money from you as your father would have."

"I don't see it; I don't believe it. The money was given us by our
fathers to spend in Europe when we get there."

"Mr. Lowington is to pay all our expenses on shore, by the terms of the
contract. Besides, the regulations of the Academy Ship, to which all the
parents assented, require that the control of the boys shall be wholly
given up to the principal. It's a plain case, Shuffles."

Mr. Lowington and his policy had an able and zealous defender in the
person of Paul Kendall, who, by his arguments, as well as his influence,
had already reconciled several of the students to the new regulation.

"If I were willing to grant the right of the principal to take the
fellows' money from them--which I am not--I think it is treating them
like babies to do so. It is punishing the innocent with the guilty."

"Mr. Lowington said, in so many words, that the measure was not
intended as a punishment; that it was purely a matter of discipline,
intended to meet certain evils which must appear when we landed in
Europe, as well as to prevent gambling."

Paul certainly had the best of the argument; but Shuffles was not
convinced, because he did not wish to be convinced.

At eight bells, when the first part of the port watch went on duty, the
wind had shifted from west to north; the studding-sails had been taken
in, the spanker, main spencer, and all the staysails had been set, and
the ship, close-hauled, was barely laying her course. The wind was
fresh, and she was heeled over on the starboard side, so that her decks
formed a pretty steep inclined plane. Under these circumstances, it
required a great deal of skill and watchfulness on the part of the
wheelmen to keep the sails full, and at the same time to lay the course.
As the ship's head met the heavy seas, a great deal of spray was dashed
on deck, and the position of the lookout-men on the top-gallant
forecastle was not as comfortable as if the weather had been warmer.
There was no dodging; every student was obliged to stand at his post,
wet or dry, blow high or blow low.

Wilton had been discharged from confinement in the brig, where Mr.
Agneau had visited him, giving him good advice and religious
instruction, as he did to all who were punished in any manner, and was
now with his watch on deck. The new regulation was particularly odious
to "our fellows," and Wilton regarded himself as a martyr to the popular
cause, forgetting that he had been punished for the lies he had told.
He and twenty others were forward to say they "wouldn't stand it;" and
the indignation seemed to be increasing rather than subsiding.

"Well, Wilton, how do you like the inside of the brig?" asked Shuffles,
when they met in the maintop, having been sent aloft to clear away the
bowline bridle on the main-topsail.

"I like it well enough," replied Wilton. "I wasn't going to blow on the
fellows; I would stay in there a month first."

"Did you give up your money?"

"Of course I did; I couldn't help myself."

"How do you like the new regulation?"

"I don't like it any better than the rest of the fellows do," answered
Wilton, in surly tones. "I won't stand it, either."

"O, I guess you will," laughed Shuffles. "I told you Lowington was a
tyrant, but you wouldn't believe me."

"Yes, I would; and I did."

"The fellows will find out what he is before they are many days older."

"I think they have found out now, I say, Shuffles, was this the row you
spoke about last night?"

"Yes; only there's more of it than I expected."

"How did you know anything about it beforehand?"

"I have a way of finding out these things," replied the artful
conspirator, mysteriously. "I have one or two friends at court."

"Is Paul Kendall one of them?"

"No; he is a simpleton. He don't know which side his bread is buttered.
If Lowington takes snuff, Kendall sneezes."

"I have seen you talking with him two or three times to-day."

"I was only pumping him."

"Well, there is a jolly row on board now, anyhow," added Wilton, as he
prepared to descend over the cat-harpings.

"Hold on; don't let's go on deck yet," interposed Shuffles. "I want to
know what our fellows are going to do."

"They will call us down, if we stop here."

"When they do, we will go down, then," replied Shuffles, as he seated
himself in the top, with his legs through the lubber's-hole. "What are
our fellows going to do? Do they mean to stand this thing?"

"They can't help themselves; they are mad enough to do anything; but
what's the use?" added Wilton, as he seated himself by the side of his
companion.

"Don't you think they will join the League now?"

"They would join anything that would give them their rights. I'll join
now; but I don't want to be toggled in such a way as you said last
night."

"Then you can't be toggled at all."

"I haven't any idea of falling overboard accidentally. I'd rather lose
my money than do that."

"It's nothing but a form, Wilton. Between you and me, it's only a
bugbear, intended to work upon the nerves and the imagination. Of course
we shouldn't help any fellow overboard; no one would dare to do any such
thing."

"I don't like the sound of the thing."

"If you really mean to expose the secrets which are intrusted to you, I
advise you not to join."

"I don't mean any such thing," added Wilton, indignantly.

"If you didn't, you wouldn't be afraid of the penalty."

"Toggle me, then; and see what I mean."

"I don't want you to go in if you don't believe in it."

"But I do believe in it; so go ahead."

Shuffles pronounced the ridiculous obligation again, and Wilton repeated
it after him.

"Now you are toggled," said the leader.

"What are we going to do?"
