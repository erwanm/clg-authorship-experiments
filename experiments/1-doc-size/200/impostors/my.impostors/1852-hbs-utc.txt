tickle Andy as he did so, which occasioned Andy to split out 
into a laugh, greatly to Haley's indignation, who made a cut 
at him with his riding-whip. 

" I's 'stonished at yer, Andy," said Sam, with awful 
gravity. "This yer's a seris business, Andy. Ter 
musn't be a makin' game. This yer an't no way to help 
mas'r." 

" I shall take the straight road to the river," said Haley, 
decidedly, after they had come to the boundaries of the 
estate. " I know the way of all of 'em they makes tracks 
for the underground." 

" Sartin," said Sam, " dat's de idee. Mas'r Haley hits de 
thing right in de middle. Now, der's two roads to de river 
de dirt road and der pike which mas'r mean to take ? " 

Andy looked up innocently at Sam, surprised at hearing 
this new geographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he 
said by a vehement reiteration. 

" 'Cause," said Sam, " I'd rather be 'clined to 'magine that 
Lizzy 'd take de dirt road, bein' it's the least travelled." 

Haley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and 
naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought 
up by this view of the case. 

" If yer warn't both on yer such cussed liars now ! " he 
said, contemplatively, as he pondered a moment. 

The pensive, reflective tone in which this was spoken 
appeared to amuse Andy prodigiously, and he drew a little 
behind and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of 
falling off his horse, while Sam's face was immoveably 
composed into the most doleful gravity. 

" Course," said Sam, "mas'r can do as he'd ruther ; go de 
straight road, if mas'r thinks best it's all one to us. Now, 
when I study 'pon it, I think de straight road de best 



"She would naturally go a lonesome way," said Haley, 
thinking aloud, and not minding Sam's remark. 

" Dar a'nt no sayin'," said Sam ; " gals is pecular. They 
never does nothin' ye thinks they will ; mose gen'lly the 
contrar. Grals is nat'lly made contrary ; and so, if you thinks 
they've gone one road, it is sartin you'd better go t'other, 
and then you'll be sure to find 'em. Now, my private 'pinion 





is, Lizzy took der dirt road; so I think w'd better take de 
straight one." 

This profound generic view of the female sex did not 
seem to dispose Haley particularly to the straight road ; and 
he announced decidedly that he should go the other, and 
askedJSam when they should come to it. 

".A little piece a-head," said Sam, giving a wink to Andy 
with the eye which was on Andy's side of the head ; and he 
added gravely, " but I've studded on de matter, and I'm 
quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way. I nebber been 
over it no way. It's despit lonesome, and we might lose 
our way whar we'd come to, de Lord only knows." 

" Nevertheless," said Haley, " I shall go that way." 

" Now I think on't, I think I hearn 'em tell that dat ar road 
was all fenced up and down by der creek, and thar ; an't it, 
Andy?" 

Andy wasn't certain, he'd only "hearn tell" about that 
road, but never been over it. In short, he was strictly 
non-committal. 

Haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities 
between lies of greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it 
lay in favour of the dirt road aforesaid. The mention of the 
thing he thought he perceived was involuntary on Sam's 
part at first ; and his confused attempts to dissuade him he 
set down to a desperate lying, on second thoughts, as being 
unwilling to implicate Eliza. 

When, therefore, Sain indicated the road, Haley plunged 
briskly into it, followed by Sam and Andy. 

Now, the road, in fact, was an old one that had formerly 
been a thoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many 
years after the laying of the new pike. It was open for 
about an hour's ride, and after that it was cut across by 
various farms and fences. Sam knew this fact perfectly 
well ; indeed, the road had been so long closed up that Andy 
had never heard of it. He therefore rode along with an air 
of dutiful submission, only groaning and vociferating 
occasionally that " 'twas desp't rough, and bad for Jerry's 
foot." 

" Now, I jest give yer warning," said Haley, " I know 
yer ; yer won't get me to turn off" this yer road, with all yer 
fussin' so you shet up ! " 





" Mas'r will go his own way ! " said Sam, with rueful submission, at the same time winking most portentously to 
Andy, whose delight was now very near the explosive point. 

Sain was in wonderful spirits ; professed to keep a very 
brisk look-out at one time exclaiming that he saw " a gal's 
bonnet " on the top of some distant eminence, or calling to 
Andy "if that thar was'nt Lizzy down in the hollow" 
always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy 
part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed was 
a special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus 
keeping Haley in a state of constant commotion. 

After riding about an hour in this way, the whole party 
made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard 
belonging to a large farming establishment. Not a soul was 
in sight, all the hands being employed in the fields; but, 
as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the 
road, it was evident that their journey in that direction had 
reached a decided finale. 

" Wan't dat ar what I tell'd mas'r ? " said Sam, with an 
air of injured innocence. "How does strange gentlemen 
'spect to know more about a country dan de natives born 
and raised?" 

" You rascal ! " said Haley, " you knew all about this." 

" Didn't I tell yer I know'd, andyer wouldn't believe me ? 
I tell'd mas'r it was all shet up, and fenced up, and I didn't 
'spect we could get through Andy heard me." 

It was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man 
had to pocket his wrath with the best grace he was able, and 
all three faced to the right about, and took up their line of 
march for the highway. 

In consequence of all the various delays, it was about 
three quarters of an hour after Eliza had laid her child to 
sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into 
the same place. Eliza was standing by the window, looking 
out in another direction, when Sam's quick eye caught a 
glimpse of her. Haley and Andey were two yards behind. 
At this crisis Sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and 
uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation, which startled 
her at once, she drew suddenly back ; the whole train swept 
by the window, round to the front door. 

A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one 





moment to Eliza. Her room opened by a side-door to the 
river. She caught her child, and sprang down the steps 
towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of her, just as 
she was disappearing down the bank ; and throwing himself 
from his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was 
after her like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment, 
her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the water's edge. Bight on behind they 
came ; and, nerved with strength such as Grod gives only to 
the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she vaulted, 
sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of 
ice beyond. It was a desperate leap impossible to any- 
thing but madness and despair ; and Haley, Sam, and Andy 
instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she 
did it. 

The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted 
pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she stayed 
there not a moment. "With wild cries and desperate energy 
she leaped to another and still another cake ; stumbling 
leaping slipping springing upwards again ! Her shoes 
are gone her stockings cut from her feet while blood 
marked every step ; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till 
dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man 
helping her up the bank. 

" Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar ! " said the man, 
with an oath. 

Eliza recognised the voice and face of a man who owned a 
farm not far from her old home. 

" Oh Mr. Symmes ! save me do save me do hide me ! " 
said Eliza. 

"Why, what's this?" said the man. "Why, if 'tant
