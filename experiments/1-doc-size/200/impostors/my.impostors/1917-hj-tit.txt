fact of. I warned him, I sincerely, passionately 
warned him, that I'm not fit, in the smallest de- 
gree, for the use, for the care, for even the most 
rudimentary comprehension, of a fortune; and 
that exactly it was which seemed most to settle 
him. He wanted me clear, to the last degree, 
not only of the financial brain, but of any sort 
of faint germ of the money-sense whatever — 
down to the very lack of power, if he might be 
so happy (or if / might!) to count up to ten on 
my fingers. Satisfied of the limits of my arith- 
metic he passed away in bliss." 

To this, as fairly lucid, Horton had applied 
his understanding. "You can't count up to ten ?" 





 

"Not all the way. Still," our young man 
smiled, "the greater inspiration may now give 
me the lift." 

His guest looked as if one might by that time 
almost have doubted. But it was indeed an ex- 
traordinary matter. "How comes it then that 
your want of arithmetic hasn't given you a want 
of order? — unless indeed I'm mistaken and you 
were perhaps at sixes and sevens?" 

"Well, I think I was at sixes — though I never 
got up to sevens ! I've never had the least rule 
or method; but that has been a sort of thing I 
could more or less cover up — from others, I mean, 
not from myself, who have always been help- 
lessly ashamed of it. It hasn't been the disorder 
of extravagance," Gray explained, "but the 
much more ignoble kind, the wasteful thrift that 
doesn't really save, that simply misses, and that 
neither enjoys things themselves nor enjoys their 
horrid little equivalent of hoarded pence. I 
haven't needed to count far, the fingers of one 
hand serving for my four or five possessions; 
and also I've kept straight not by taking no 
liberties with my means, but by taking none 
with my understanding of them. From fear of 
counting wrong, and from loathing of the act 
of numerical calculation, and of the humiliation 
of having to give it up after so few steps from 
the start, I've never counted at all — and that, 
you see, is what has saved me. That has been 





 

my sort of disorder — which you'll agree is the 
most pitiful of all." 

Horton once more turned away from him, but 
slowly this time, not in impatience, rather with 
something of the preoccupation of a cup-bearer 
whose bowl has been filled to the brim and who 
must carry it a distance with a steady hand. So 
for a minute or two might he have been taking 
this care; at the end of which, however, Gray 
saw him stop in apparent admiration before a 
tall inlaid and brass-bound French bahut; with 
the effect, after a further moment, of a sharp 
break of their thread of talk. "You've got some 
things here at least to enjoy and that you ought 
to know how to keep hold of; though I don't 
so much mean," he explained, "this expensive 
piece of furniture as the object of interest perched 
on top." 

"Oh the ivory tower! — yes, isn't that, Vinty, 
a prize piece and worthy of the lovely name?" 

Vinty remained for the time all admiration, 
having, as you would easily have seen, lights 
enough to judge by. "It appears to have been 
your uncle's only treasure — as everything else 
about you here is of a newness ! And it isn't so 
much too small, Gray," he laughed, "for you 
to get into it yourself, when you want to get 
rid of us, and draw the doors to. If it's a 
symbol of any retreat you really have an eye on 
I much congratulate you; I don't know what 





 

I wouldn't give myself for the 'run' of an ivory 
tower." 

"Well, I can't ask you to share mine," Gray 
returned; "for the situation to have a sense, I 
take it, one must sit in one's tower alone. And 
I should properly say," he added after an hesi- 
tation, "that mine is the one object, all round 
me here, that I don't owe my uncle: it has been 
placed at my disposition, in the handsomest way 
in the world, by Rosanna Gaw." 

"Ah that does increase the interest — even if 
susceptible of seeming to mean, to one's bewilder- 
ment, that it's the sort of thing she would like 
to thrust you away into; which I hope, however, 
is far from the case. Does she then keep ivory 
towers, a choice assortment ? " Horton quite 
gaily continued; "in the sense of having a row 
of them ready for occupation, and with tenants 
to match perchable in each and signalling along 
the line from summit to summit ? Because" — 
and, facing about from his contemplation, he 
piled up his image even as the type of object 
represented by it might have risen in the air — 
"you give me exactly, you see, the formula of 
that young lady herself: perched aloft in an ivory 
tower is what she is, and I'll be hanged if this 
isn't a hint to you to mount, yourself, into just 
such another; under the same provocation, I 
fancy her pleading, as she has in her own case 
taken for sufficient." Thus it was that, suddenly 





 

more brilliant than ever yet, to Graham's ap- 
prehension, you might well have guessed, his 
friend stood nearer again — stood verily quite 
irradiating responsive ingenuity. Markedly would 
it have struck you that at such instants as this, 
most of all, the general hush that was so thick 
about them pushed upward and still further 
upward the fine flower of the inferential. Follow- 
ing the pair closely from the first, and beginning 
perhaps with your idea that this life of the in- 
telligence had its greatest fineness in Gray Fielder, 
you would by now, I dare say, have been brought 
to a more or less apprehensive foretaste of its 
possibilities in our other odd agent. For how 
couldn't it have been to the full stretch of his 
elastic imagination that Haughty was drawn out 
by the time of his putting a certain matter beau- 
tifully to his companion ? " Don't I, 'gad, take 
the thing straight over from you — all of it you've 
been trying to convey to me here ! — when I see 
, you, up in the blue, behind your parapet, just 
gracefully lean over and call down to where I 
mount guard at your door in the dust and com- 
parative darkness ? It's well to understand" — 
his thumbs now in his waistcoat-holes he measured 
his idea as if Gray's own face fairly reflected it : 
"you want me to take all the trouble for you 
simply, in order that you may have all the fun. 
And you want me at the same time, in order that 
things shall be for you at their ideal of the easiest, 





 

to make you believe, as a salve to your conscience, 
that the fun isn't so mixed with the trouble as 
that you can't have it, on the right arrangement 
made with me, quite by itself. This is most in- 
genious of you," Horton added, "but it doesn't 
in the least show me, don't you see ? where my 
fun comes in." 

"I wonder if I can do that," Gray returned, 
"without making you understand first some- 
thing of the nature of mine — or for that mat- 
ter without my first understanding myself 
perhaps what my queer kind of it is most likely 
to be." 

His companion showed withal for more and 
more ready to risk amused recognitions. "You 
are 'rum' with your queer kinds, and might make 
my flesh creep, in these conditions, if it weren't 
for something in me of rude pluck." Gray, in 
speaking, had moved towards the great French 
meuble with some design upon it or upon the 
charge it carried; which Horton's eyes just won-
