am betting it was — and provided there 
was an explosive in the cabin and 
connected with that end of the fuse — ddaits 

which I am also betting there was, 
though I can't prove it. Boys, the 
barrel is there in the chaparral, the 
candle's remains are in it in the tin 
stick ; the burnt-out fuse is in the gim- 
let-hole, the other end is down the hill 
where the late cabin stood. I saw 
them all an hour or two ago, when 
the Professor here was measuring off 
unimplicated vacancies and collecting 
relic5.ihat hadn't anything to do with 
the case,!' v 

He paused. The house drew a 
long, deep breath, shook its strained 
cords and muscles free and burst 
into cheers. 


"Dang him'' said Ham Sandwich, 
"that's why he was snooping around 
in the chaparral, instead of picking 
up points out of the P'fessor's game. 
Looky here — he ain't no fool, boys' 
"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" 
But Stillman was resuming: 
" While we were out yonder an hour 
or two ago, the owner of the gimlet 
and the trial-candle took them from a 
place where he had concealed them — 
it was not a good place — and carried 
them to what he probably thought 
was a better one, two hundred yards 
up in the pine woods, and hid them 
there, covering them over with pine 
needles. It was there that I found 
them. The gimlet exactly fits the 
hole in the barrel. And now — " 

The Extraordinary Man interrupted 
him. He said, sarcasticall} : 

"We have had a very pretty fairy- f 
tale, gentlemen — very pretty indeed.  

Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot 

"In-deed? This is interesting — this 
is very interesting. Perhaps you en- 
countered the assassin yourself?" 

"No, I encoimtered no one." 

"Ah. Then — if you will excuse 
the remark — I do not quite see the 
relevancy of the information." 

"It has none. At present. I say 
it has none — at present." He paused. 
Presently he resumed: "I did not en- 
counter the assassin, but I am on his 
track, I am sure, for I believe he is in 
this room. I will ask you all to pass 
one by one in front of me — here, where 
there is a good light — so that I can 
see your feet' 

A buzz of excitement swept the 
place, and the march began, the guest 
looking on with an iron attempt at 
gravity which was not an unqualified 
success. Stillman stooped, shaded 
his eyes with his hand, and gazed 
down intently at each pair of feet as 
it passed. Fifty men tramped monot- 
onously by — with no result. Sixty. 
Seventy. The thing was beginning 
to look absurd. The guest remarked, 
with suave irony, 

"Assassins appeal to be scar ce 
this evening." 

The house saw the humor of it, and 


refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. 
Ten or twelve more candidates tramped 
by — no, danced by, with airy and 
ridiculous capers which convulsed the 
spectators — then suddenl} Stillman 
put out his hand and said, 

" This is the assassin !" 
" Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhe- 
drim!'' roared the crowd; and at once 
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and 
dazzle and confusion of stirring re- 
marks inspired by the situation. 

At the height of the turmoil the 
guest stretched out his hand, com- 
manding peace. The authority of a 
great name and a great personality 
laid its mysterious compulsion upon 
the house, and it obeyed. Out of the 
panting calm which succeeded, the 
guest spoke, saying, with dignity 
and feeling: 

"This is serious. It strikes at an 
innocent life. Innocent beyond sus- 
picion! Innocent beyond perad vent- 
ure! Hear me prove it; observe how 
simple a fact can brush out of existence 
this witless lie. Listen. My friends, 
that lad was never out of my sight 
yesterday~evenTng at any time \" 

It made a deep impression. Men 
turned their eyes upon Stillman with 
grave inquiry in them. His face 
brightened, and he said, 

"I knew there was another one!" 
He stepped briskly to the table and 
glanced at the guest's feet, then up at 
his face, and said: "You were with 
him! You were not fifty steps from 

him when he lit the candle that by- 
and-by fired the powder .' (Sensor 
tion.) "And what is more, you furnished 
the matches yourself!'' matches 

plainly the guest seemed hit; it 
looked so to the public. He opened 
his mouth to speak; the words did 
not come freely. 

'' This — er — this is insanity — 
this—"
