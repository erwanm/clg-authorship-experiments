' yes ! to my post.' 

' I hope she will make you happy, Evan,' Diana said 
gently and cordially. 

' You are very good, I am sure. I don't want you to 
think, Diana, that I that I, in fact, have forgotten anything ' 

' You cannot forget too soon,' she answered smiling, 
 everything that Clara would not wish you to remember.' 

' A fellow is so awfully lonely out there on the frontiers ' he said mumbling his words through his moustache 
in a peculiar way. 

' You will not be lonely now, I hope.' 

' You see, Di,' you were lost to me. If I could only 
think of you as happy ' 

' You may.' 

'Happy?' he repeated, looking at her. He had 
avoided her eyes until now. 

' Yes.' 



 

' Then you have forgotten ? ' 

' One does not forget,' said Diana, with again a grave 
smile. ' But I have ceased to look back sorrowfully.' 

' But you are married ' 

Then light flushed into Diana's face. She understood 
Evan's allusion. 

' Yes,' she said, ' to somebody who has my whole 
heart.' 

' But you are married to Mr. Masters ? ' he went on 
incredulously. 

' Certainly. And I love my husband with all the strength 
there is in me to love. I hope your wife will love you as 
well,' she added with another smile, a different one, which 
was exceedingly aggravating to the young man. No 
other lips could wreathe so with such a mingling of softness 
and strength, love, and yes, happiness. Captain Knowlton had seen smiles like that upon those lips once, long 
ago, never a brighter or more confident one. He felt 
unaccountably injured. 

' You did not speak so when I saw you last,' he remarked. 

' No. I was a fool,' said Diana with somewhat unreasonable perverseness. ' Or, if I was not a fool, I was weak.' 

' I see you are strong now,' said the young officer bitterly. ' I was never strong; and lam weak still. I have 
not forgotten, Diana.' 

' You ought to forget, Evan,' she said gently. 

' It's impossible ! ' said he, hastily turning over photo- 
graphs on the table. 

Diana would have answered, but the opportunity was 
gone. Other people came near ; the two fell apart from 
each other, and no more words were interchanged between 
them. 



 

It grieved but did not astonish Basil to perceive when 
he joined Diana in their own room that night, that she had 
been weeping; and it only grieved him to know that the 
weeping was renewed in the night. He gave no sign that 
he knew it, and Diana thought he was asleep through it all. 
Tears were by no means a favourite indulgence with her 
this night the spring of them seemed to be suddenly 
unsealed, and they flowed fast and free and were not to 
be checked. Neither did Diana quite clearly know what 
moved them. She was very sorry for Evan ; yes, but these 
tears she was shedding were not painful tears. It came 
home to her, all the sorrowful waiting months and years 
that Basil had endured on her account ; but sympathy was 
not a spring large enough to supply such a flow. She was 
glad those months were ended ; yet they were not ended, 
for Basil did not know the facts she had stated with so 
much clearness tohiswhilome rival ; she had not told himself, and he did not guess them. ' He might,' said Diana 
to herself, ' he ought ' at the same time she knew now 
there was something for her to do. How she should do 
it, she did not know. 




CHAPTER XXXVII. 



THEY returned to Pleasant Valley that day, and Basil 
was immediately plunged in arrears of business. For the 
present Diana had to attend to her mother, whose con- 
versation was anything but agreeable after she learned that 
her son-in-law had accepted the call to Mainbridge. 

' Ministers are made of stuff very like common people, 
she declared. ' Every one goes where he can get the most.' 

' You know Mr. Masters has plenty already, mother ; 
plenty of his own.' 

' Those that have most already are always the ones that 
want more. I've seen that a thousand times. If a man's 
property lies in an onion, he'll likely give you half of it 
if you want it ; if he's got all Pleasant Valley, the odds are 
he won't give you an onion.' 

Diana would have turned the conversation, but Mrs. 
Starling came back to the subject. 

' What do you suppose you are going to do with me ? ' 

' Mother, that is for you to choose. You know, where- 
ever we are, there's a home for you if you will have it.' 

' It's a pleasure to your husband to have me too, ain't 
it?' 

' It is always a pleasure to him to do what is right.' 

' Complimentary ! You have grown very fond of him, 
haven't you ? all of a sudden.' 

But this subject Diana would not touch. Not to her 




mother Not to any one, till the person most concerned 
knew the truth ; and most certainly after that not to any 
one else. Evan had been told ; there had been a reason ; 
she was glad she had told him. 

' What do you suppose I'd do in Mainbridge ? ' Mrs. 
Starling went on. 

' There is plenty to do, mother. It is because there is 
so much to do, that we are going.' 

' Dressing and giving parties. I always knew your husband held himself above our folks. He'll be suited there.' 

This tried Diana, it was so very far from the truth. She 
fled the field. It was often the safest way. But she was 
very sorry for her mother. She went to Basil's study, 
where now no one was, and sat down by the window that 
looked into the garden. There Rosy presently caught 
sight of her ; came to her, and climbed up into her lap ; 
and for a good while the two entertained one another ; the 
child going on in wandering sweet prattle, while the 
mother's thoughts, though she answered her, kept a deeper 
current of their own all the while. She was pondering as 
she sat there and smelled the roses in the garden and talked 
to the small Rose in her lap, she was pondering what she 
should do to let her husband know what she now knew 
about herself. One would say, the simplest way would be, 
to tell him ! but Diana, with all her simplicity and sweetness, had a New England nature ; and though she could 
speak frankly enough when spoken to, on this or any other 
subject, she shrank from volunteering revelations that were 
not expected of her ; revelations that were so intimate and 
belonged to her very inner self ; and that concerned be- 
sides so vitally her relations with another person, even 
though that person were her husband. At the mere thought 
of doing it, the colour stirred uneasily in Diana's face 



 

Why could not Basil divine ? Looking out into the garden, 
both mother and child, and talking very busily one of them, 
thinking very busily the other, neither of them heard Basil 
come in. 

' Where's papa ? ' Rosy was at the moment asking, in 
a tone sufficiently indicating that in her view of things he 
had been gone long enough. 

' Not very far off ' was the answer, close behind them. 
Rosy started and threw herself round towards her father, 
and Diana also started and looked up ; and in her face not 
less than in the little one there was a flash and a flush of 
sudden pleasure. Basil stooped to put his lips to Rosy's, 
and then, reading more than he knew in Diana's eyes, he 
carried the kiss to her lips also. It was many a day since
