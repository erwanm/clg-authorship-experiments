most cases.”

Still she was not satisfied. “More peculiar than mine?”

“Than yours?”--Clement Yule knew nothing about that.

Something, at this, in his tone, his face--it might have been his
“British” density--seemed to pull her up. “I forgot--you don’t
know mine. No matter. What is yours?”

He took a few steps in thought. “Well, the fact that I’m asked to
change.”

“To change what?”

He wondered how he could put it; then at last, on his own side,
simplified. “My attitude.”

“Is that all?”--she was relieved again. “Well, you’re not a
statue.”

“No, I’m not a statue; but on the other hand, don’t you
see? I’m not a windmill.” There was good-humour, none the less, in
his rigour. “The mortgages I speak of have all found their way, like
gregarious silly sheep, into the hands of one person--a devouring wolf,
a very rich, a very sharp man of money. He holds me in this manner
at his mercy. He consents to make things comfortable for me, but he
requires that, in return, I shall do something for him that--don’t
you know?--rather sticks in my crop.”

It appeared on this light showing to stick for a moment even in
Mrs. Gracedew’s. “Do you mean something wrong?”

He had not a moment’s hesitation. “Exceedingly so!”

She turned it over as if pricing a Greek Aldus. “Anything immoral?”

“Yes--I may literally call it immoral.”

She courted, however, frankly enough, the strict truth. “Too bad to
tell?”

He indulged in another pensive fidget, then left her to judge. “He
wants me to give up----” Yet again he faltered.

“To give up what?” What could it be, she appeared to ask, that was
barely nameable?

He quite blushed to her indeed as he came to the point. “My
fundamental views.”

She was disappointed--she had waited for more. “Nothing but
them?”

He met her with astonishment. “Surely they’re quite enough,
when one has unfortunately”--he rather ruefully smiled--“so very
many!”

She laughed aloud; this was frankly so odd a plea. “Well, I’ve a
neat collection too, but I’d ‘swap,’ as they say in the West, the
whole set----!” She looked about the hall for something of equivalent
price; after which she pointed, as it caught her eye, to the great cave
of the fireplace. “I’d take that set!”

The young man scarcely followed. “The fire-irons?”

“For the whole fundamental lot!” She gazed with real yearning at
the antique group. “They’re three hundred years old. Do you mean
to tell me your wretched ‘views’----?”

“Have anything like that age? No, thank God,” Clement Yule
laughed, “my views--wretched as you please!--are quite in their
prime! They’re a hungry little family that has got to be fed. They
keep me awake at night.”

“Then you must make up your sleep!” Her impatience grew with her
interest. “Listen to me!”

“That would scarce be the way!” he returned. But he added
more sincerely: “You must surely see a fellow can’t chuck his
politics.”

“‘Chuck’ them----?”

“Well--sacrifice them.”

“I’d sacrifice mine,” she cried, “for that old fire-back with
your arms!” He glanced at the object in question, but with such a
want of intelligence that she visibly resented it. “See how it has
stood!”

“See how I’ve stood!” he answered with spirit. “I’ve glowed
with a hotter fire than anything in any chimney, and the warmth and
light I diffuse have attracted no little attention. How can I consent
to reduce them to the state of that desolate hearth?”

His companion, freshly struck with the fine details of the desolation,
had walked over to the chimney-corner, where, lost in her deeper
impression, she lingered and observed. At last she turned away with her
impatience controlled. “It’s magnificent!”

“The fire-back?”

“Everything--everywhere. I don’t understand your haggling.”

He hesitated. “That’s because you’re ignorant.” Then seeing
in the light of her eye that he had applied to her the word in the
language she least liked, he hastened to attenuate. “I mean of
what’s behind my reserves.”

She was silent in a way that made their talk more of a discussion than
if she had spoken. “What is behind them?” she presently asked.

“Why, my whole political history. Everything I’ve said, everything
I’ve done. My scorching addresses and letters, reproduced in all
the papers. I needn’t go into details, but I’m a pure, passionate,
pledged Radical.”

Mrs. Gracedew looked him full in the face. “Well, what if you
are?”

He broke into mirth at her tone. “Simply this--that I can’t
therefore, from one day to the other, pop up at Gossage in the purple
pomp of the opposite camp. There’s a want of transition. It may be
timid of me--it may be abject. But I can’t.”

If she was not yet prepared to contest she was still less prepared to
surrender it, and she confined herself for the instant to smoothing
down with her foot the corner of an old rug. “Have you thought very
much about it?”

He was vague. “About what?”

“About what Mr. Prodmore wants you to do.”

He flushed up. “Oh, then, you know it’s he?”

“I’m not,” she said, still gravely enough, “of an intelligence
absolutely infantile.”

“You’re the cleverest Tory I’ve ever met!” he laughed. “I
didn’t mean to mention my friend’s name, but since you’ve done
so----!” He gave up with a shrug his scruple.

Oh, she had already cleared the ground of it! “It’s he who’s the
devouring wolf? It’s he who holds your mortgages?”

The very lucidity of her interest just checked his assent. “He holds
plenty of others, and he treats me very handsomely.”

She showed of a sudden an inconsequent face. “Do you call that
handsome--such a condition?”

He shed surprise. “Why, I thought it was just the condition you could
meet.”

She measured her inconsistency, but was not abashed. “We’re
not talking of what I can meet.” Yet she found also a relief in
dropping the point. “Why doesn’t he stand himself?”

“Well, like other devouring wolves, he’s not personally adored.”

“Not even,” she asked, “when he offers such liberal terms?”

Clement Yule had to explain. “I dare say he doesn’t offer them to
everyone.”

“Only to you?”--at this she quite sprang. “You are personally
adored; you will be still more if you stand; and that, you poor lamb,
is why he wants you!”

The young man, obviously pleased to find her after all more at
one with him, accepted gracefully enough the burden her sympathy
imposed. “I’m the bearer of my name, I’m the representative of my
family; and to my family and my name--since you’ve led me to it--this
countryside has been for generations indulgently attached.”

She listened to him with a sentiment in her face that showed how now,
at last, she felt herself deal with the lawful heir. She seemed to
perceive it with a kind of passion. “You do of course what you will
with the countryside!”

“Yes”--he went with her--“if we do it as genuine Yules. I’m
obliged of course to grant you that your genuine Yule’s a Tory of
Tories. It’s Mr. Prodmore’s belief that I should carry Gossage in
that character, but in that character only. They won’t look at me in
any other.”

It might have taxed a spectator to say in what character Mrs. Gracedew,
on this, for a little, considered him. “Don’t be too sure of
people’s not looking at you!”

He blushed again, but he laughed. “We must leave out my personal
beauty.”

“We can’t!” she replied with decision. “Don’t we take in
Mr. Prodmore’s?”

Captain Yule was not prepared. “You call him beautiful?”
