must elapse before he could be of any assistance, if indeed 
assistance were needed then. 

Bertram was shocked at first and could not keep the 
tears from his eyes. He glanced over the paper but 
everything blurred, he looked out on the dreary March 
landscape as it whirled by and it seemed to express deso- 
lation rather than the coming of spring. After awhile 
he turned to his books, he had counted on passing away 
the tedium with study, but he could only think of Sher- 
burne House and the anxious, sorrowing household, his 
dear mother ! Of course, papa could not die. He had 
never known him in any state but robust health. Yet 
there would be days when no one would know except 
each in his secret heart. 

Doctor Carew found a friend on the train and they fell 
into a discussion. Sherburne sat gloomily, his thoughts 
a curious chaos. Not any more than Bertram would he 
believe death possible, but an awful fear tugged at his 
heart. He went out to the smoking car, but the cigar 
had no flavor, and the men were laughing at some rough 





stories. The air was stifling. So he returned and picked 
up the paper. If one could only get along without 
thinking ! But it was better even to see the stricken 
household with that far sight, than it was to live over the 
last two months and his woes. 

The journey seemed endless, but few things really are 
in this world. Doctor Carew had tried to lighten the 
burthen for both boys, but only Bertram had responded. 
More than once he had stolen a glance at Sherburne's 
handsome, gloomy face, and thought of his own disap- 
pointment in the lad. Could he have made the path 
more attractive for youthful feet ? He had a feeling that 
he had not done his cordial best, because he had not 
quite approved. 

Yet he did feel thankful Sherburne had not plunged 
into dissipation. He would be saved the mortifying con- 
sciousness of not having been able to cope with that 
viciousness. And perhaps a shock like this would rouse 
the latent manhood in him. 

They reached Sherburne House just at the edge of the 
evening. Tessy came to meet them in the spacious hall. 
She put out her hand to Doctor Carew, then went to the 
strong arms of her firstborn son, and in an instant seemed 
to live over the first absorbing year of her happy married 
life, crowned indeed by his coming. 

How small and sweet, and exhausted she was ! What 
if all the rest of her life he was to be her protector and 
try to fill a vacant place that after all never could be 
filled. A solemn impression of responsibility seemed to 
overwhelm him. No one had spoken. Doctor Carew, 
so used to the house, had hurried up to the sick chamber. 
What if 

"O mamma, mamma!" cried Bertram, crowding in 





and kissing the wet face in a passion of sorrow, " God 
will be good to us ! It has been in my heart every 
moment of the journey from Washington, and isn't 
that strong desire prayer? I know he will hear and 
answer." 

"How is he?" asked Sherburne, huskily. 
"He has been unconscious since noon." 
To Tessy Beaumanoir the bitterness of death had al- 
ready passed. When she had looked upon the white, 
still face, the half-closed eyes, and kissed down on the 
damp cool brow she felt it was the last farewell. She 
had not dared to plead for a word. Doctor Underwood 

had said 

" You may come in a moment if you will not speak or 
utter the slightest sound." 

Then she had gone out again and tried to comfort the 
household. 

"You have had no supper." Then she put an arm 
about each of her boys, both so much taller than she, 
and they walked through to the dining-room. But no one 
could eat. Sherburne drank a cup of tea. Princess 
came in and afterward they adjourned to the sitting- 
room, where the other children were huddled together, 
waiting in breathless awe. 

Tessy Beaumanoir knew she has been blessed among 
women. All these years no evil had come nigh her. 
There had been few illnesses, not at all alarming, there 
had been prosperity, satisfaction, happiness and worldly 
advancement. Yesterday she had wept and prayed, and 
said she could not yield up this best love of her life upon 
God's altar. But to-day she knew it all belonged to God, 
husband, children, prosperity, happiness. Whatever He 
sent she must accept. She would suffer in the sorrow, 





had not even He wept over his friend's grave, but it 
would not be as those without hope. 

They did not try to talk after the first few questions 
Princess asked. Doctor Carew came down for some sup- 
per and took their mother out with him. Years ago, he 
remembered he had fought for the young life, and rea- 
son with it as well. 

Tessy looked her wordless question. 

" No one can tell," he answered. " There is nothing 
I can do or suggest, yet I am glad you sent for me. 
Dr. Underwood has been splendid." 

"They were not so alarmed at first. I think if he 
had come home at once — but we cannot distrust God's 
wisdom. And when they thought there would be a turn 
for the better, it was worse instead. Everybody has 
been full of kindness and solicitude. ' ' 

"Now there is only waiting. There comes a time 
when the issues of life and death rest alone with God. 
My great hope is in Leonard's splendid constitution. 
If he should go through the night, the test of that will 
come afterward." 

Then he returned to the patient. There was no 
change. 

"You will remain?" he inquired of Doctor Under- 
wood. 

" O yes. I have had some one with me the last two 
nights. Somehow I can't give him up." 

After awhile the children kissed their mother good- 
night and went to bed. Bertram was both tired and 
sleepy. 

" Will you not go as well ? " she asked of Sherburne. 

" No. I couldn't sleep. Let me stay with you," and 
the voice was beseeching. 





"Then we will go upstairs." 

Sherburne followed his mother to the room adjoining 
that in which his father lay. The door was closed. 
There was a cheerful fire upon the wide hearth and a 
lounge with a slumber robe thrown carelessly over it. 

"You had better lie down," he said, softly. "You 
look exhausted." 

She suffered herself to be placed comfortably and cov- 
ered. Then he drew his chair up beside her. 

"Thank you," she said, softly. "We cannot talk 
lest we disturb them. But there will be time enough for 
that." 

She was so white and wan that his heart was moved 
immeasurably. 

In his father's young life there had been two years of 
invalidism from an accident, and everybody had joined 
in attention and caresses until he had felt as if the world 
was really made for his enjoyment. And though this 
luxury of indulgence had not been Sherburne's, nothing 
had been demanded from him. His two years abroad 
had been quite self-indulgent, and he had enjoyed no 
little admiration. To consider another's comfort would 
be an acquired rather than inherited virtue. Not that he 
was more selfish than hundreds of young people to whom 
fate has been kindly. 

But as he sat here now his heart warmed strangely to 
his mother. If any one had suggested that he did not 
truly love her, he would have been angry enough to 
knock him down. And yet — what was love but readiness 
to do another's pleasure, not simply the pleasure of one
