minded his glances very much before, she had become 
accustomed to being almost stared at, but this sent 
strange little shivers over her which were neither heat 
nor cold but a vague sort of deliciousness. And he was 
saying odd suggestive things that did not mean anything 
of course, but occasionally she wished he would not. 
Others might use this sort of society flattery, but he had 
no need. She hoped they had come to something better, 
to friendship. 





It was not a tiresomely long concert. He made a few 
notes and some approving nods, and then wrapped her 
fur cape about her and put up the collar, elbowing a 
way through the crowd for her. What a manly, fine- 
looking person he was. She recalled the fact that these 
solicitous attentions were natural to him when he was on 
his best behavior and not afflicted with laziness. He 
was not putting on anything special to-night, she told 
herself. 

But it was a new thing to be almost carried up the 
stairs, and then have him fumble with the key and come 
to his assistance, and feel her hand crumpled up in his 
as she opened the door. 

He turned up the gas just a little. How warm it felt 
after the keenness outside, and the suggestive softness 
through the ground globe made shadows in the corners 
and gave a weird look to the pile of cushions as if some 
one might be hiding there. 

"Take off your wraps," he said. "I am going to 
stay until Mrs. Townsend comes home. She has never 
entrusted you to my care before, and I want to return 
you in good order. Were you paid for going? " 

"Why, yes — since I had none of the expense," she 
answered, laughingly. 

"And the little tickets were complimentary." 

"There were car fares," sententiously. 

"Yes. Gertrude, you will make an admirable wife 
for a poor man. You must insist upon having a house- 
hold account book. A penny saved is as good as a 
penny earned, I have heard, so be careful of the pen- 
nies." 

" When I find the poor man." 

" Is your heart so set upon poverty? That is youthful 





and romantic, but rather unwise at the end of the cen- 
tury, when money seems such a factor." 

He had dropped on the sofa. She stood beside him, 
wondering a little at his mood. He caught her hand 
and drew her down. 

"Gertie," he said, "considerably more than a year 
ago there was some incipient love-making. He was a 
rather oldish fellow, and she was a young girl who had 
seen nothing of the world, and who, if she had been just 
a tint more scheming would have heard him through, 
and maybe accepted him. But she refused him as any 
good honorable girl would have who wasn't quite certain 
what either of them meant. It was one of those wise 
blunders that sometimes occur when people are not sure 
of themselves or each other. And now the old fellow is 
a year older, and the girl has had some experience and a 
young lover, and she knows there is more than one man 
in the world. Do you think she can love well enough to 
bridge over all the years between and be happy with 
him? " 

Gertrude Maurice sat upright, stiff and surprised, and 
simply looked at Mr. Murray. 

"Will I do — Gertie?" he said, softly, and his arm 
was about her, drawing her down to his shoulder. 

" O, you don't mean — " there was a little convulsive 
catch in her voice. 

"I mean that I love you and want you. I mean a 
great many more things that you will go on finding out 
year by year, if you conclude to take me. Some you 
will like, some won't suit you at all, but you see I am an 
oldish fellow and can't fly around like a weather cock at 
every young girl's whim. But taking it all in all, if you 
think you can love me we may get along fairly. I shall 





want a great deal of love — quite as much as any young 
fellow." 

" O ! " with a soft cry. Then she hid her face. Did 
he really want her ? If she had asked her gift out of all 
the world, it would have been this. A week ago she had 
settled to a delightful friendship, and thought the world 
had nothing more to give her. 

" Gertrude? " 

" O, I think now you must know, that you must 
have known it all along. One day — on the sand sat Mel- 
chias Island. It was just a look. I could not think you 
would come to care for me. I envied the girl for whom 
you would care. And that night on the boat — I was not 
sure how much you meant, and I didn't want any one to 
say I had taken a mean advantage of your lovely hospi- 
tality. I would rather have given you up." 

" And now you don't mind what any one thinks? " 

There was a strand of mirthfulness in his tone. 

"I am afraid I don't." 

He drew the flushed face up to his and gave her her 
first lover's kisses. 

" Gertrude," he began, seriously, some moments later, 
"I want you to consider this subject of age. When I 
am sixty you will be at the finest period of a woman's 
life. And it is only fair to warn you there is very little 
chance of widowhood. My father is hale and hearty, 
and I feel within me the certain premonitions of old age. 
I shall want to be loved and coddled and cared for — I 
dare say I shall be jealous and unreasonable. I won't 
begin by painting those years in rose color, even if we 
have violets in their sweetness all along first. And this is 
a grave question." 

" But you are not old ! " she protested. " And did it 





ever occur to you that I am not young for twenty years ? 
Or else I have lived in some other life and have vague 
experiences of it ? " 

"I want you young. That's a bit of my unreason- 
ableness. And I want you sweet and fond and bright to 
take me back to that magical land. I want love enough 
to make up for all these years. And I will promise to be 
better than the Browning lover, I will love you the whole 
year round, not merely < half the year.' " 

She laughed delightedly. 

" Do you think Princess will like it ? " she asked, pres- 
ently. " She loves you so." 

" She has given me permission." 

" I wonder if I had never come into your life after 
that night on the boat — " she said, hesitatingly. 

"Ah, but you were not going out. I will tell you 
now — Mrs. Townsend wrote to me while we were at the 
island. I thought the place would suit you better than 
the teaching you abhorred. I did not think of myself 
just then, that came a little later. I saw her that day in 
New York. She had written to Mrs. St. John and re- 
ceived her commendation, and made an appointment to 
meet you. She taxed me with a suspicious fondness, 
and on condition that I was not to interfere, neither see 
you nor write to you for a year, she engaged to keep you 
tolerably safe, unless some enchanting young man came 
along." 

"They were rather middle aged," said Gertrude, 
mirthfully. "There were two of them, one rich, and 
famous in his own estimation." 

"And I am famous in other people's estimation. That 
makes a great difference." 

" And you knew all the while? " 



" I was not going to let you out into the great world 
with no watchful care. And if the young man had ap- 
peared I should have hurried to the fray at once."
