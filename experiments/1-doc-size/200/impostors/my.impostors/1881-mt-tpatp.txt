“Who art thou? What is thy business here?” 

“Leave thy foolery,” said the man, “and quiet 
thyself. My disguise is none so good that thou 
canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through 
it.” 

“Thou art not my father. I know thee not. I 
am the king. If thou hast hid my servant, find him 
for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast 
done.” 

John Canty replied, in a stem and measured 
voice: 

“It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to ptm- 
ish thee; but if thou provoke me, I must. Thy 

prating doth no harm here, where there are no eais 
that need to mind thy follies, yet is it well to 
practise thy tongue to wary speech, that it may do no 
hurt when our quarters change. I have done a 
murder, and may not tarry at home — neither shalt 
thou, seeing I need thy service. My name is 
changed, for wise reasons; it is Hobbs — John 
Hobbs; thine is Jack — charge thy memory accordingly.
Now, then, speak. Where is thy mother? 
Where are thy sisters? They came not to the place 
appointed — knowest thou whither they went?” 

The king answered, sullenly: 

"Trouble me not with these riddles. My mother 
is dead; my sisters are in the palace.” 

The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, 
and the king would have assaulted him, but Canty — 
or Hobbs, as he now called himself — prevented 
him, and said; 

"Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, 
and thy ways fret him. Sit thee down. Jack, and 
quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat, 
anon.” 

Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low 
voices, and the king removed himself as far as he 
could from their disagreeable company. He with- 
drew into the twilight cf the farther end of the bam, 
where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep 
with straw. He lay down here, drew straw over 
himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed 
in thinking. He had many griefs, but the minor 
caies were swept almost into forgetfulness by the 
supreme one, the loss of his father. To the rest of 
tire world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, 
aid suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed de- 
stiuction and whose hand dealt scourgings and 
death; but to this boy the name brought only sen- 
satons of pleasure, the figure it invoked wore a 
countenance that was all gentleness and affection. 
He called to mind a long succession of loving pas- 
sages between his father and himself, and dwelt 
fondly upon them, his unstinted tears attesting how 
deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart. 
As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with 
his troubles, sunk gradually into a tranquil and heal- 
ing slumber. 

After a considerable time — he could not tell how 
long — his senses struggled to a half-consciousness, 
and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely wondering 
where he was and what had been happening, he 
noted a murmurous soimd, the sullen beating of rain 
upon the roof. A snug sense of comfort stole over 
him, which was rudely broken, the next moment, 
by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. 
It startled him disagreeably, and he unmuffled his 
head to see whence this interruption proceeded. A 
grim and unsightly picture met his eye. A bright 
fire was burning in the middle of the floor, at the 
other end of the bam; and around it, and lit weirdly 
up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the mothest 
company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of 
both sexes, he had ever read or dreamed of. There 
were huge, stalwart men, brown with exposure, long- 
haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; the were 
middle-azed youths, of truculent countenance, and 

similarly dad; there were blind mendicants, with 
patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones, with 
wooden legs and crutches; there was a villain- 
iooking peddler with his pack; a knife-grinder, a 
tinker, and a barber-surgeon, wnth the implements 
of their trades; some of the females were hardly 
grown girls, some were at prime, some were old and 
wrinlded hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul- 
mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were 
three sore-faced babies; there were a couple of 
starveling curs, with strings about their ned, whose 
office w'as to lead the blind. 

The night was come, the gang had just finished 
feasting, an orgy was beginning, the can of liquor 
was passing from mouth to mouth. A general cry 
broke forth: 

“A song! a song from the Bat and Dick Dot- 
and-go-One!” 

One of the blind men got up, and made ready by 
casting aside the patches that sheltered his excdlent 
eyes, and the pathetic placard which recited the 
cause of his calamity. Dot-and-go-One disencum- 
bered himself of his timber leg and took his place, 
upon sound and healthy limbs, beside his fellow- 
rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty, and 
were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of 
each stanza, in a rousing chorus. By the time the 
last stanza was reached, thehalf-drunken enthusiasm 
had risen to such a pitch that everybody joined in 
and sang it dear through from the beginning, pro- 
ducing a volume of villainous sound that made the 
rafters quake. These were the inspiring words: 

“Bien Daxkmans then, Bouse Mort and Ken, 

The bien Coves bings awast, 

On Chates to trine by Ronae Coves dine 
For his long lib at last. 

Bing’d out bien Morts and toure, and toure, 

Bing out of the Rome vile bine. 

And toure the Cove that cloy’d yoirr duds. 

Upon the Chates to trine.”* 

Conversation followed; not in the thieves’ dialect 
of the song, for that was only used in talk when 
unfriendly ears might be listening. In the course of 
it it appeared that Hobbs” was not altogether 

a new recruit, but had trained in the gang at some 
former time. His later history was called for, and 
when he said he had “accidentally” Idiled a man, 
considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he 
added that the man was a priest, he was rotmdly 
applauded, and had to take a drink with everybody. 
Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new 
ones were proud to shake him by the hand. He 
was asked why he had “tarried away so many 
months.” He answered: 

“London is better than the country, and safer 
these late years, the laws be so bitter and so
diligently enforced. An I had not had that accident, 
I had stayed there. I had resolved to stay, and 
nevemxore venture countrywards — but the accident 
had epded that.” 

He inquired how many persons the gang numbered 
now. The “Rufler,” or chief, answered: 

“Five and twenty sturdy bpdges, bulks, files, 
dapperdogeons and maunders, counting the dells

and doxies and other morts.* Most are here, the 
rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. 
We follow at dawn.” 

“I do not see the Wen among the honest folk 
about me. Where may he be?” 

“Poor lad, his diet is brimstone now, and over 
hot for a delicate taste. He was killed in a brawl, 
somewhere about midsummer.” 

“I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable 
man, and brave.” 

“That was he, truly. Black Bess, his dell, is 
of us yet, but absent on the eastward tramp; a 
fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none 
ever seeiag her drunk above four dass in the seven.” 

“She was ever strict — remember it well — a 
goodly wench and worthy all commendation. Her 
mother was more free and less particular; a 
troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with 
a wit above the common.” 

“We lost her through it. Her gift of palmistry 
and othffl* sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at 
last a witch’s name and fame. The law roasted her
