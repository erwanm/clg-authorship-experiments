Captain John. 

" I told you the squall was coming half an hour 
ago, Captain John. Why didn't you come on deck, 
and attend to your vessel ? " 



 



" Don't be sassy,*' said Captain John, in reply 
to this unanswerable argument. 

" I'm not the skipper of this craft. If I had 
been, that sail would have been safe, I told you 
the squall was coming, and after that I did the 
best I could." 

" You ain't good for nothin' 'board a vessel. I 
thought you knew enough to take in sail when you 
saw a squall comin'." 

" I should have taken in sail long ago if I had 
thought the captain didn't know enough to come on 
deck when there was a squall coming up," replied 
Lawry, as he walked aft, disgusted with the conduct 
of the skipper. 

" I don't want nothin' more of you." 

" And I don't want anything more of you," added 
Lawry, smartly. " I've got almost home." 

" What do you s'pose I"m goin' to do here, 
eighty mile from Whitehall, with the mainsail blowed 
clean out ? " snarled Captain John, as he followed 
Lawry. 

" Mmd your vessel better than you have, I hope." 
" Don't be sassy, boy." 



 



" You needn't growl at me because you neglected 
your duty. I did mine. I was casting off the hal- 
yards when the squall came." 

" Why didn't you do it before ? That's what I 
want to know." 

" I had no orders from the captain. Men on board 
a vessel don't take in sail till they are told to do 
so. When I saw the squall coming, half an hour 
ago, I let you know it ; that was all I had to do 
with it, if your old tub went to the bottom." 

" I don't want you in this vessel ; you are too 
smart for me," continued Captain John, who could 
not combat the clinching argument of the youth. 

" I'll leave her just as soon as we get to Port 
Kock," said Lawry, sitting down on the rail. 

The rain ceased in a few moments, and the skip- 
per ordered the jib, which had before been useless, 
to be set. At the invitation of Mrs. Captain John, 
Lawry went below and ate his dinner, to which he 
felt himself entitled, for he was working his passage 
up from Plattsburg. By the time he had disposed 
of the last piece of green-apple pie on board, the 
Missisque was before Port Eock, which was the home 






of the young pilot, and he saw his father's ferry- 
boat at the shore as he came on deck. 

" Will you put me ashore here, Captain John ? " 
asked Lawry. 

" Yes, I will ; and I'm glad to get rid of you," 
replied the captain, testily. 

" I think I will land here, also," added the bank 
director. " Now you have lost your sail, I'm afraid 
you won't get along very fast." 

" I don't expect I shall. I shan't get to Shore- 
ham till to-morrow morning with this wind. I'm 
sorry it happened so ; but that boy didn't mind 
what he was about." 

" The captain didn't mind what he was about," 
added Lawry. " He needn't lay it to me, when it 
was all his own fault." 

" I will cross the lake, and get a horse at Point- 
ville, so that I shall be in Shoreham by five o'clock," 
continued the bank director, who was disposed to 
remain neutral between the contending parties. 

Captain John ordered one of the men to pull Mr. 
Ilandall and Lawry ashore in tlic boat, and in a 
few minutes they were Imded at Port Rock. 







CHAPTER II. 

THE PORT HOCK FEKKY. 

Lawrence Wileord was a full-fledged water- 
fowl. From his earliest childhood he had paddled 
in Lake Champlain. His father had a small place, 
consisting of ten acres of land with a small cottage ; 
but it was still encumbered with a mortgage, as it 
had been for twenty years, though the note had 
passed through several hands, and had been three 
times renewed. John Wilford was not a very sa- 
gacious nor a very energetic man, and had not dis- 
tinguished himself in the race for wealth or for fame. 
He wanted to be rich, but he was not M'illing to 
pay the price of riches. 

llh place was a short distance from the village 
of Port Eock, and John Wilford, at the time he 
had purchased the land and built his house, had 
established a ferry, whicli had been, and was still. 




his principal means of support ; for there was con- 
siderable travel between Port Rock and Pointville, 
on the Vermont side of the lake. 

The ferryman was a poor man, and was likely to 
remain a poor man to the end of his life. Hardly 
a day passed in which he did not sigh to be rich, 
and complain of the unequal and unjust distribution 
of property. He could point to a score of men who 
had not worked half so hard as he had, in his own 
opinion, tliat had made fortunes, or at least won a 
competence, while he was as poor as ever, and in 
danger of having his place taken away from him. 
People said that John Wilford was lazy; that he 
did not make the most of his land, and that his 
ferry, with closer attention to the wants of passen- 
gers, might be made to pay double the amount he 
made from it. He permitted the weeds to grow in 
his garden, and compelled people to wait by the 
hour for a passage across tho lake. 

John Wilford wondered that he coidd not grow 
rich, that he could not pay off the mortgage on his 
place. He seldom sat down to dinner without grum- 
bling at his hard lot. His wife was a sensible wo- 



man. She did not wonder that he did not grow 
rich ; only that he contrived to keep out of the 
poorhouse. She "was the muther of eight children, 
and if he had been half as smart as she was, pros- 
perity would have smiled upon the family. As it 
was, her life was filled up with struggles to make the 
ends meet ; but, though she had the worst of it, she 
did not complain, and did all she could to comfort 
and encourage her thriftless husband. 

The oldest son was as near like his father as one 
person could be like another. He was eighteen years 
old, and was an idle and dissolute fellow. Law- 
rence, the second son, inherited his mother's tact 
and energy. He was observing and enterprising, 
and had already made a good reputation as a boat- 
man and pilot. He had worked in various capaci- 
ties on board of steamers, canal boats, sloops, and 
schooners, and in five years had visited every part 
of the lake from Whitehall to St. John's. 

Speaking technically, his bump of locality was 
large, and he was as familiar with the navigation 
of the lake as any pilot on its waters. Indeed, he 
had occasionally served as a pilot on board steamers
