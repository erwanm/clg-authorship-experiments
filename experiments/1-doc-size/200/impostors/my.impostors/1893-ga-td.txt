clouds were those heavy brows, lowered to the 
lightning which sprang fro»n depths below. 
I looked again at Chonita. The pink color was 
in her marble face ; pinker were her carven 
lips. 

'God of my soul ! " I said to Estenega. 
"Go home.'' 

"My Prudencia," said Don Guillermo. He 
lifted her to the pink saddle, adjusted her foot 
in the pink ribbon, climbed up behind her, 
placed one arm about her waist, took the bridle 
in his other hand, and cantered out of the 
court- yard. Reinaldo sprang to his horse, 
lifted his mother in front of him, and followed. 
Then went the bridesmaids ; and the rest of 
us fell into line as we listed. As we rode up 
the valley, those awaiting us joined the caval- 
cade, the populace closing it, spreading out 
like a fan attached to the tail of a snake. The 
bells rang out a joyful discordant peal ; the 
long undulating line of many colors wound 
through the trees, passed the long corridor of 
the Mission, to the stone steps of the church. 

The ceremony was a long one, for com- 
munion was given the bride and groom ; and 
during the greater part of it I do not think 
Estenega removed his gaze from Chonita. I 

could not help observing her too, although I 
was deeply impressed with the solemnity of the 
occasion. Her round womanly figure had 
never appeared to greater advantage than in 
that close-fitting gown ; her hips being rather 
wide, she wore fewer gathers than was the 
fashion. Her faultless arms had a warmth in 
their whiteness ; the filmy lace of her mantilla 
caressed a throat so full and round and white 
and firm that it seemed to invite other caresses ; 
even the black pearls clung lovingly about it. 
Her graceful head was bent forward a little, 
and the soft black lashes brushed her cheeks. 
The pink flush was still in her face, like the 
first tinge of color on the chill desolation of 
dawn. 

" Is she not beautiful.? " whispered Estenega, 
eagerly. "Is not that a woman to make 
known to herself.? Think of the infinite possi- 
bilities, the sublimation of every "' 

Here I ordered him to keep quiet, reminding 
him that he was in church, a fact he had quite 
forgotten. I inferred that he remembered it 
later, for he moved restlessly more than once 
and looked longingly toward the door. 

It was over at last, and as the bride and 
groom appeared in the door of the church and 
descended the steps, a salute was fired from 


the Presidio. On the long corridor a table had 
been built from end to end and a goodly ban- 
quet provided by the padres. We took our 
seats at once, the populace gathering about a 
feast spread for them on the grass. 

Padre Jimeno, the priest who had officiated at 
the ceremony, sat at the head of the table ; the 
other priests were scattered among us, and good 
company all of them were. We were a very 
lively party. Prudencia was toasted until her 
calm important head whirled. Reinaldo made 
a speech as full of flowers as the occasion
demanded. Alvarado made one also, five sentences 
of plain well-chosen words, to which the 
bridegroom listened with scorn. Now and 
again a girl swept the strings of a guitar or a 
caballero sang. The delighted shrieks of the 
people came over to us ; at regular intervals 
cannons were fired. 

Estenega found himself seated between Cho- 
nita and Valencia. I was opposite, and begin- 
ning to feel profoundly fascinated by this drama 
developing before my eyes. I saw that he was 
amused by the situation and not in the least 
disconcerted. Valencia was nervous and eager. 
Chonita, whose pride never failed her, had 
drawn herself up and looked coldly indif- 
ferent. 



"Senor,' murmured Valencia, "thou wilt 
tarry with us long, no ? We have much to 
show thee in Santa Barbara, and on our ran- 
chos." 

"I fear that I can stay but a week, senorita. 
I must return to Los Angeles. " 

" Would nothing tempt thee to stay, Don 
Diego ? " 

He looked into her rich Southern face and 
approved of it : when had he ever failed to 
approve of a pretty woman ? ' ' Thine eyes, 
senorita, would tempt a man to forget more 
than duty." 

"And thou wilt stay?" 

"When I leave Santa Barbara what I take 
of myself will not be worth leaving." 

" Ay ! and what thou leavest thou never 
shalt have again. " 

"There is my hope of heaven, senorita." 

He turned from this glittering conversation 
to Chonita. 

"You are a little tired," he said, in a low 
voice. " Your color has gone, and the shadows 
are coming about your eyes." 

The suspicion was borne home to her that 
he must have observed her closely to detect 
those shades of difference which no one else 
had noted 
 

"A little, sefior. I went to bed late and 
rose early. Such times as these tax the endu- 
rance. But after a siesta I shall be refreshed." 

" You look strong and very healthy." 

"Ay, but I am ! I am not delicate at all. 
I can ride all day, and swim — which few of 
our women do. I even like to walk ; and I 
can dance every night for a week. Only, this 
is an unusual time." 

Her supple elastic figure and healthy white- 
ness of skin betokened endurance and vitality, 
and he looked at her with pleasure. "Yes, 
you are strong," he said. ''You look as if you 
would last, — as if you never would grow brown 
nor stout." 

" What difference, if the next generation be 
beautiful ? " she said, lightly. " Look at Don 
Juan de la Borrasca. See him gaze upon Pan- 
chita Lopez, who is just sixteen. What does 
he care that the women of his day are coffee- 
colored and stringy or fat ? You will care as 
little when you too are brown and dried up, 
afraid to eat dulces, and each month seeking a 
new parting for your hair. " 

' ' You are a hopeful seer ! But you — are you 
resigned to the time when even the withered 
old beau will not look at you, — you who are 
the loveliest woman in the Californias ? " 


It was the first compliment he had paid her, 
and she looked up with a swift blush, then low- 
ered her eyes again. " With truth, I never im- 
agine myself except as I am iiow ; but I should 
have always my books, and no husband to 
teach me that there were other women more 
fair." 

" And books will suffice, then ? " 

"Sure." She said it a little wistfully. Then 
she added, abruptly, " I shall go to confession 
this week." 

^'Ah!" 

"Yes ; for although I hate you still — that is, 
I do not like you — I have forgiven you. I believe
you to be kind and generous, although 
the enemy of my brother ; that if you did op- 
pose him and cast him into prison, you did so 
with a loyal motive ; you cannot help making 
mistakes, for you are but human. And I do 
not forget that if it were not for you he would
