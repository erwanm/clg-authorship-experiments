coming to him. And I would rather be in 
his arms and have him bless me, if I were 
you, than be anywhere else, or have anything 
else. And so would you, Tilly." 
"But, Mr. Richmond it is because I am 
not good." 
" Yes, I know it. But that is a reason for 
 
giving yourself to the Lord Jesus. He will 
make you good ; and there is no other way." 
But Tilly's trouble at this got beyond management. She left her seat and came to Mr. 
Richmond, letting his arm draw her up to 
him, and dropping her head on his shoulder. 
"O Mr. Richmond," she said, "I don't 
know how ! " 
" Don't know how to give yourself to Jesus ? Do it in your heart, Tilly. He is 
there. Tell him he may have you for his 
own child. He is at the door of your heart 
knocking; open the door and bid him come 
in. He will make it a glad place if you 
do." 
" Mr. Richmond," said the child with great 
difficulty between her sobs, "won't you tell 
him that I will ? " 
They kneeled down and the minister madt 
a short prayer. But then he said, 
" Now, Tilly, I want you to teU the Lord 
yourself." 
"I can't, Mr. Richmond " 
 
" I think you can. And I want you to
try." 
They waited and waited. Tilly sobbed 
softly, but the minister waited still. At last 
Tilly's tears ceased ; then with her little 
hands spread before her face, she said very 
slowly, 
" O Lord, I am a naughty child. I want to 
be good. I will do everything that you tell 
me. Please take my heart and make it all 
new, and help me to be strong and do right. 
Amen." 
They rose up, but Mr. Richmond kept the 
child within his arm, where she had been 
standing. 
" Now, Tilly, how do we know that our 
prayers are heard ? " 
" God has promised, hasn't he, Mr. Richmond?" 
" Where ? in what words ? " 
Tilly hesitated, and then repeated part of 
the verse, " Ask, and it shall be given you 
Seek, and ye shall find." 
* And look here," said Mr. Richmond, half 
turning, so as to bring her and himself within 
reach of the Bible that lay at his elbow on 
the table, " see here, Matilda. Read these 
words." 
" ' If ye shall ask anything in my name, I 
will do it."' 
And here," 
" ' Whatsover ye shall ask the Father in my 
name, he will give it you.' " 
" Does Jesus ever break his promises? " 
" No, Mr. Richmond ; he can't." 
" Then remember that, whenever you think 
of to-day, and whenever you feel troubled or 
weak. You are weak, but he is strong; 
and he cannot break his promises. So 
you and I are safe, as long as we hold to 
him." 
There was silence a little while, and Mr. 
Richmond set the apple to twirling again. 
It had untwisted its string and was hanging 
still. 
" I am to put your name now, I sup- 
pose, Tilly, among the names of our Band 
ami?" 
" Yes, Mr. Richmond." 
"What work would you like specially to 
do?" 
" I do not know, Mr. Richmond ; I will 
think." 
<r Very well; that is right. And there is 
another place where your name ought to go 
is there not ? " 
" I don't know, sir." 
" Yes among those who desire to be 
members of the church to tell the world 
they are Christ's people." 
" O no, Mr. Richmond ! " 
" Why O no, Mr. Richmond ' ? " 
"I am not good enough. I want to be 
better first." 
" How do you expect to get better ? " 
Silence. 
" I suppose your thought is, that Jesus will 
make your heart new, as you asked him just 
now, and help you to be strong. Is that it ? 
Yes. And you do not expect to accomplish the change or grow strong by your own 
power ? " 
O no, sir." 
" Don't you think Jesus loves you now as 
Well as he will by and by, and is as ready to 
nelp you ? " 
" Yes, Mr. Richmond." 
" Then, Tilly, I call it just distrust of him, 
to hold off from what he commands you to 
do, for fear he will not help you to do it. I 
would be ashamed to offer such an excuse to 
him." 
"But has he commanded that, Mr. Richmond?" 
" He has commanded us to confess openly 
that we are his servants, hasn't he? and to 
be baptized in token of the change he has 
wrought in us, and as a sign that we belong 
to him? How can we do either the one or 
the other without joining the church ? " 
' I thought" Matilda began, but seemingly did not like to tell what she had thought. 
"Let us have it, Tilly," said her friend, 
drawing her closer to him. " You and I are 
talking confidentially, and it is best in those 
cases to talk all out. So what did you 
think?" 
" I thought there were people who were the 
servants of Christ, and yet did not join any 
church," Matilda said softly. 
" By not doing it, they as good as say to 
the world that they are not his servants. 
And the world judges accordingly. I have 
known people under such a delusion ; but 
when they were honest, I have always 
known them to come out of it. If you give 
all you have to the Lord Jesus, you must 
certainly give your influence." 
"But, I thought I might wait" Tilly 
said again. 
"Till when?" 
" I don't know," she whispered. 
"Wait for what?" 
" Till T was more like what I ought to 
be, Mr. Richmond." 
"Till you were more like the Lord Jesus ? " 
Yes, sir." 
"Do you not think the quickest way to 
grow like him would be to do and obey 
every word he says ? " 
Matilda bowed her head a little. 
" You will be more likely to grow good 
and strong that way than any other ; and I 
am sure the Lord will be more likely to help 
you if you trust him, than if you do not 
trust him." 
" I think so too," Matilda assented. 
" Then we will do everything, shall we, 
that we think our Lord would like to have us 
do ? and we will trust him to help us through 
with it ? " Mr. Richmond said, with an 
affectionate look at the child beside him ; 
and Matilda met the look and answered it 
with another. 
"But, Mr. Richmond" 
" What is it ? " 
" There is one question I should like to 
ask." 
Ask it." 
" Why ought people to be baptized ? " 
Because our Lord commands it. Isn't 
that a good reason ? " 
" Yes, sir; but what does it mean, Mr. 
Richmond ? " 
" It is a way of saying to the world, that 
we have left it, and belong to the Lord 
Jesus Christ. It is a way of saying to the 
world, that his blood has washed away our 
sins and his Spirit has made our hearts clean ; 
or that we trust him to do both things for us. 
And it is the appointed way of saying all 
this to the world ; his appointed way. Do 
you understand ? " 
" Yes, sir." 
" Now do you not think that those who 
love the Lord Jesus, ought to be glad to 
follow his will in this matter ? " 
" Yes, sir," Matilda said again, raising hei 
eyes frankly to Mr. Richmond's face. 
" "Would you be willing to be left out, 
when next I baptize some of those who wish 
to make it publicly known that they are 
Christ's?" 
" No, sir." And presently she added. 
" When will that be, Mr. Richmond ? " 
" I do not know," he answered thoughtfully. " Not immediately. You and I must 
have some more talks before that time." 
" You are very good to me, Mr. Rich- 
mond," Matilda said gratefully. 
" Have we said all we ought to say this 
time ? Are there any more questions to 
bring up ? " 
"I haven't any to bring up," Matilda 
said.
