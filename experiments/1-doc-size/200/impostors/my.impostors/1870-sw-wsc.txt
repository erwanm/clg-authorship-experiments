course ; and in a hurry." 



 

And Anne and Letty ? " 
" Certainly ; and Issa too." 
Matilda said no more, but hastily made her 
self ready, and went down with the rest. 



CHAPTER IX. 

ANNE and Letitia were to leave home in 
the afternoon of Monday; and Maria 
and Matilda went to school that morning as 
usual. But when the noon hour came, Matilda called her sister into a corner of the emptied schoolroom, and sat down with a face of 
business. 

" What is the matter? " said Maria. " We 
must go home to dinner." 

" I should like to speak to you here first." 

" About what ? Say it and be quick ; for 
I am ever so hungry. Aunt Candy cut my 
breakfast short this morning." 

" I wanted to say to you, that we had better take home our books." 

"What for?" said Maria with opening 
eyes. 




" Because, Maria, mamma was talking to 
me last night about it. You know there will 
be no one at home now, after to-day, but you 
and me." 

" Aunt Erminia and Clarissa ? " 

" Nobody to do anything, I mean." 

" Can't they do anything? I don't know 
what you are talking of, Matilda; but I know 
I want my dinner." 

" Who do you think will get dinner to- 
morrow ? " 

" Well mother's sick of course ; and Anne 
and Letty are going. I should think aunt 
Candy might." 

" No, she won't." 

" How do you know ? " 

" Because mother said so. She won't do 
anything." 

" Then she'll have to get a girl to do things, 
I suppose." 

" But Maria, that is just what mother wants 
she shouldn't do ; because she'd have to pay 
for it." 



 

" Who would have to pay for it?" 

" Mamma." 

" Why would she ? " 

" She said so." 

" I don't see why she would, I am sure. 
If aunt Erminia hires a girl, she'll pay for 
her." 

" But that will come out of what aunt Erminia pays to mamma ; and what aunt 
Erminia pays to mamma is what we have got 
to live upon." 

"Who said so?" 

" Mamma said so." Matilda answered with 
her lip trembling; for the bringing facts all 
down to hard detail, was difficult to bear. 

Well I do think," exclaimed Maria, " if I 
had a sister sick and not able to help herself, 
I would not be so mean ! " 

Matilda sat still and cried and said noth- 
ing. 

" Who is going to do all the work then, 
Tilly ? " 

There would have been something comical, 



 

if it had not been sad, in the way the little 
girl looked up and said, " You and I." 

" I guess we will!" said Maria with open- 
ing eyes. " You and I ! Take care of the 
house, and wash the dishes, and cook the din- 
ner, and everything! You know we couldn't, 
Matilda; and what's more, 7 know we 
won't." 

" Yes, mamma wishes it. We must ; and 
so we can, Maria." 

" I can't," said Maria, taking down her 
school cloak. 

" But Maria ! we must. Marnma will be 
more sick if we do not ; you heard what aunt 
Candy said at breakfast, that she is fearfully 
nervous; and if she hears that there is a 
hired girl in the house, it will worry her dread- 
fully." 

" It will be aunt Candy's fault then," said 
Maria, fastening her cloak. " I never heard 
of anybody so mean in all my life! never." 

" But that don't help anything, Maria. 
And you and I must do what mamma said. 



You know we shall have little enough to 
live on, as it is, and if you take the pay of 
a hired girl out of it, there will be so little 
left." 

" I've got my twenty-five dollars, that I can 
get summer dresses with ; I am glad I haven't 
spent it," said Maria. " Corne, Tilly ; I'm 
going home." 

" But Maria, you have not said what you 
ought to say yet." 

What ought I to say ? " 

" I will help and do my part. We can 
manage it. Come, Maria, say that you 
will." 

" Your part," said Maria. " What do you 
suppose your part would come to ? What 
can such a child as you do ? " 

" Maria, now is the time to shew whether 
you are really one of the Band of workers." 

" I am, of course. I joined it." 

" That would not make you one of them, 
if you don't do what they promised to do." 

"When did I ever promise to be aunt 




 

Candy's servant girl ? " said Maria fiercely 
I should like to know." 

But ' we are the servants of Christ,' " said 
Matilda softly, her eyes glistening through 



What then?" 

" We promised to try to do whatever would 
honour him." 

" I don't know what all this affair has to 
do with it," said Maria. " You say we 
promised ; you didn't ? "
