stone has got to be rolled up hill ! But at least, John Rod 
man, you need not go to work at it ; you are not called upon 
to lend your shoulder." 

None the less, however, did he call out Pomp that very 
afternoon and sternly teach him " E " and " Y," using the 
smooth white sand for a blackboard, and a stick for chalk. 
Pomp's primer was a Government placard hanging on the 
wall of the office. It read as follows : 

IN THIS CEMETERY REPOSE THE REMAINS 

OF 

FOURTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE 
UNITED STATES SOLDIERS. 

" Tell me not in mournful numbers 

Life is but an empty dream ; 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
And things are not what they seem. 

" Life is real ! Life is earnest ! 

And the grave is not its goal ; 

Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 

Was not written of the soul ! " 

"The only known instance of the Government's conde 
scending to poetry," the keeper had thought, when he first 
read this placard. It was placed there for the instruction and 




edification of visitors; but, no visitors coming, he took the 
liberty of using it as a primer for Pomp. The large letters 
served the purpose admirably, and Pomp learned the entire 
quotation ; what he thought of it has not transpired. Miss 
Ward came over daily to see her cousin. At first she brought 
him soups and various concoctions from her own kitchen 
the leaky cavern, once the dining-room, where the soldier 
had taken refuge after his last dismissal from hospital ; but 
the keeper's soups were richer, and free from the taint of 
smoke ; his martial laws of neatness even disorderly old Pomp 
dared not disobey, and the sick man soon learned the differ 
ence. He thanked the girl, who came bringing the dishes 
over carefully in her own dimpled hands, and then, when she 
was gone, he sent them untasted away. By chance Miss 
Ward learned this, and wept bitter tears over it ; she con 
tinued to come, but her poor little soups and jellies she 
brought no more. 

One morning in May the keeper was working near the 
flag-staff, when his eyes fell upon a procession coming down 
the road which led from the town and turning toward the 
cemetery. No one ever came that way : what could it mean ? 
It drew near, entered the gate, and showed itself to be negroes 
walking two and two old uncles and aunties, young men and 
girls, and even little children, all dressed in their best ; a very 
poor best, sometimes gravely ludicrous imitations of " ole 
mars " or " ole miss ," sometimes mere rags bravely patched 
together and adorned with a strip of black calico or rosette of 
black ribbon ; not one was without a badge of mourning. All 
carried flowers, common blossoms from the little gardens be 
hind the cabins that stretched around the town on the out 
skirts the new forlorn cabins with their chimneys of piled 
stones and ragged patches of corn ; each little darkey had his 
bouquet and marched solemnly along, rolling his eyes around, 
but without even the beginning of a smile, while the elders 
moved forward with gravity, the bubbling, irrepressible gayety 
of the negro subdued by the new-born dignity of the freeclman. 



 

" Memorial Day," thought the keeper; " I had forgotten it." 
" Will you do us de hono , sah, to take de head ob de pro- 
cessio , sah ? " said the leader, with a ceremonious bow. Now, 
the keeper had not much sympathy with the strewing of flow 
ers, North or South ; he had seen the beautiful ceremony more 
than once turned into a political demonstration. Here, how 
ever, in this small, isolated, interior town, there was nothing 
of that kind ; the whole population of white faces laid their 
roses and wept true tears on the graves of their lost ones in 
the village churchyard when the Southern Memorial Day came 
round, and just as naturally the whole population of black 
faces went out to the national cemetery with their flowers on 
the day when, throughout the North, spring blossoms were 
laid on the graves of the soldiers, from the little Maine village 
to the stretching ranks of Arlington, from Greenwood to the 
far Western burial-places of San Francisco. The keeper 
joined the procession and led the way to the parade-ground. 
As they approached the trenches, the leader began singing 
and all joined. " Swing low, sweet chariot," sang the freed- 
men, and their hymn rose and fell with strange, sweet harmony 
one of those wild, unwritten melodies which the North heard 
with surprise and marveling when, after the war, bands of 
singers came to their cities and sang the songs of slavery, in 
order to gain for their children the coveted education. " Swing 
low, sweet chariot/ sang the freedmeri, and two by two they 
passed along, strewing the graves with flowers till all the 
green was dotted with colon It was a pathetk sight to see 
some of the old men and women, ignorant field-hands, bent, 
dull-eyed, and past the possibility of education even in its 
simplest forms, carefully placing their poor flowers to the best 
advantage. They knew dimly that the men who lay beneath 
those mounds had done something wonderful for them and 
for their children ; and so they came bringing their blossoms, 
with little intelligence but with much love. 

The ceremony over, they retired. As he turned, the keeper 
eaught a glimpse of Miss Ward's face at the window; 


" Hope we's not makin too free, sah," said the leader, as 
the procession, with many a bow and scrape, took leave, " but 
we's kep de day now two years, sah, befo you came, sah, an 
we's teachin de chil en to keep it, sah." 

The keeper returned to the cottage. " Not a white face," 
he said. 

" Certainly not," replied Miss Ward, crisply. 

" I know some graves at the North, Miss Ward, graves of 
Southern soldiers, and I know some Northern women who do 
not scorn to lay a few flowers on the lonely mounds as they 
pass by with their blossoms on our Memorial Day." 

" You are fortunate. They must be angels. We have no 
angels here." 

" I am inclined to believe you are right," said the keeper. 

That night old Pomp, who had remained invisible in the 
kitchen during the ceremony, stole away in the twilight and 
came back with a few flowers. Rodman saw him going down 
toward the parade-ground, and watched. The old man had 
but a few blossoms ; he arranged them hastily on the mounds 
with many a furtive glance toward the house, and then stole 
back, satisfied ; he had performed his part. 

Ward De Rosset lay on his pallet, apparently unchanged ; 
he seemed neither stronger nor weaker. He had grown 
childishly dependent upon his host, and wearied for him, as 
the Scotch say ; but Rodman withstood his fancies, and gave 
him only the evenings, when Miss Bettina was not there. 
One afternoon, however, it rained so violently that he was 
forced to seek shelter ; he set himself to work on the ledgers ; 
he was on the ninth thousand now. But the sick man heard 
his step in the outer room, and called in his weak voice, 
" Rodman, Rodman." After a time he went in, and it ended 
in his staying ; for the patient was nervous and irritable, and 
he pitied the nurse, who seemed able to please him in nothing. 
De Rosset turned with a sigh of relief toward the strong 
hands that lifted him readily, toward the composed manner, 
toward the man's voice that seemed to bring a breeze from 




outside into the close room ; animated, cheered, he talked 
volubly. The keeper listened, answered once in a while, and 
quietly took the rest of the afternoon into his own hands. 
Miss Ward yielded to the silent change, leaned back, and 
closed her eyes. She looked exhausted and for the first time 
pallid ; the loosened dark hair curled in little rings about her 
temples, and her lips were parted as though she was too tired 
to close them; for hers were not the thin, straight lips that 
shut tight naturally, like the straight line of a closed box. 
The sick man talked on. " Come, Rodman," he said, after a 
while, " I have read that lying verse of yours over at least ten 
thousand and fifty-nine times ; please tell me its history ; I 
want to have something definite to think of when I read it for 
the ten thousand and sixtieth." 

" Toujours femme vane, 
Bien fou qui's y fie ; 
Unc femme souvent 
N est qu une plume au vent," 

read the keeper slowly, with his execrable English accent. 
" Well, I don't know that I have any objection to telling the 
story. I am not sure but that it will do me good to hear it 
all over myself in plain language again." 

" Then it concerns yourself," said De Rosset ; " so much 
the better. I hope it will be, as the children say, the truth, 
and long." 

" It will be the truth, but not long. W T hen the war broke 
out I was twenty-eight years old, living with my mother on 
our farm in New England, My father and two brothers had 
died and left me the homestead ; otherwise I should have 
broken away and sought fortune farther westward, where the
