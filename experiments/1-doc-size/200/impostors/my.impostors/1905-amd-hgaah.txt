It came swiftly down to them, its beacon light 
shining and showing up the young oarsman who 
called out: 

"Hello ! Be you the crowd fast in the rift?" 



 

They answered. But where was May? And 
had he come by pure providential accident? 

"Is there any such thing?" queried one of the 
girls. 

Tim made his explanations. Then he gave 
a shout that made the woods ring. It was soon 
answered. 

"Jack and the lady ain't far off. You see you 
would have been safe even in a shower. But 
it's rather funny that you should have been druv 
jest in here. I don't s'pose you could have done 
it on a try !" 

"The gust of wind did it. Rude Boreas sure 
enough." 

There tvas another call through the woods. 
Then the sound of voices and the rustling of 
shrubbery and the two figures emerged in the 
moonlight. 

"Oh, Mayl" exclaimed the girls in a breath. 

"Did you get tired waiting? But I found 
some one at last. It's rather lonely up here and 
not thickly settled," with a laugh. 

Tim and Jack did a little sparring at first. Then 
the elder said to the girls : 

"I'll hold my boat stiddy up to your stern and 
you step over keerful, jest one at a time, though 
you'd only get a ducking if you tumbled, you 



 

wouldn't drown. We'll see 'bout your boat to- 
morrow. Danged if I b'Heve she'll run away. 
How many of you gals can row ?" 

"Six of us." 

"Then we won't need Jack, and the boat will 
be full enough without him." 

They were taken off without any misadventure. 
Even the flowers followed suit. Miss Bradshaw 
expressed her warmest thanks to Jack, who said 
in country awkwardness â€” " 'Twas jest nothin' at 
all, only I don't b'lieve you could have found your 
way alone." 

Although they were cold, their spirits rose as 
they went spinning down the stream. Then 
they caught sight of another light and were 
greeted with a signal cry. 

In truth, as time passed the two ladies at the 
school began to feel very anxious, especially when 
the shower threatened. The younger girls had 
retired, the elder ones were gathered about Mrs. 
Aldred, never wearying of hearing the interesting 
episodes of her journey. Yet Helen Grant's 
thoughts strayed off now and then to the grace- 
ful, dainty figure that had stood in the hall an- 
nouncing her plans and pleasures with such a 
triumphant air. Only a few days more and they 
would give each other a careless good-bye and 


the old difference would never be made up. But 
then, other girls had gone their way, other youth- 
ful friendships had been sundered. Still she did 
regret that she must go out of the life of Mr. 
and Mrs. Bell. 

Presently there was a note of alarm. "I think 
we had better walk down to the dock," Mrs. 
Aldred said. "And it might be wisdom to send 
a boat up to meet them." 

Several of the older girls begged to go, so 
quite a party set out. No alarm was felt, as the 
girls had been up the river many a time and 
there really was no chance of an accident; they 
had gone farther than they meant, or spent more 
time gathering flowers, and the little squall 
had been only momentary. But down in the 
south there were some suspicious looking clouds 
and the wind was hovering about the east. 

However a boat went out with two men. But 
it needed not to go very far and then there was 
a cheerful shout floating down to them that told 
everybody was safe. 

"It was quite romantic," declared Miss Brad- 
shaw, with the brightest laugh she could sum- 
mon, for she was really cold and tired. "We ran 
into a rift and were wedged fast. There wasn't 
a bit of danger, but we had to hunt up someone 



 

to come to the rescue, which Mr. Beecroft did 
gallantly, and so, like the old woman with her 
misadventures, we were enabled to get home that 
very same night. Your thanks are due to him." 

He was explaining how they had failed to 
blow the rift out of the river and left it in a 
rather dangerous condition. Half a dozen vol- 
unteered to go up the next day and settle the 
matter after rescuing the boat. 

They hurried homeward, and though there had 
been no real danger there was a feeling of grati- 
tude in every heart. There were hot baths and 
ginger tea and everybody was safe in bed about 
midnight. 

"Though I think we shall get the shower after 
all," said Mrs. Aldred. "It is growing quite close 
and warm again, and the south looks suspicious. 
It would be an improvement to have a little cooler 
weather." 



CHAPTER III 

WAS IT A WISH FULFILLED? 

While the stars were still out in the north 
there were vivid flashes of lightning and purple 
black clouds seemed to rush up from the south 
while the northerly gust tore them in tatters, 
veering this way and that. Suddenly a glow 
seemed to set the world on fire, and a tremendous 
peal of thunder crashed everywhere and rolled 
off to the gulf of Mexico, followed by a sharp 
dash of rain. 

Just after the peal there was a wild cry of 
terror and when Miss Wiley opened her door to 
listen she saw a white figure running to and fro 
talking and sobbing. 

"Oh, Miss Daisy, what is it? You are safe, 
dear," and she clasped her in her arms. 

But the girl was confused and past reasoning, 
her eyes distraught, her whole frame shaking as 
with an ague. Mrs. Aldred joined her and they 
tried to tranquilize Daisy, but in vain. She talked 
of some awful danger and held tightly to the 
friendly arm. 




 

Miss Wiley glanced into her room and made a 
light. "There is nothing amiss," she explained, 
"but the peal of thunder was terrific." 

The girls came out in affright to see what had 
happened. Mrs. Aldred entreated them to re- 
turn to their rooms, and begged Miss Wiley to 
take Daisy to hers while she prepared a com- 
posing draught, and called up the nurse. There 
was no real danger, and in all probability Miss 
Bell had been roused from her first sleep and was 
hysterical. 

"Of course their adventure was trying to the 
nerves and I noticed that Miss Daisy looked 
utterly exhausted. But if we can get her to sleep 
again I think she will be all right." 

Mary came and tried her soothing powers but 
Daisy appeared possessed by some wild idea of
