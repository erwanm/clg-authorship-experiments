I was called to Olive at eleven. She enquired 
about my breakfast, and I told her. 

" You were pleased with the music last night," 
said she carelessly. 

" Very much ! Were not you ? " 

" I was rather tired. I don't fancy violins so 
much." 

" Violins ! But Ms violin ? " 

"Yes, it's very fine, no doubt; but I like the 
voice better. I would rather hear Lucetti." 

" Who is Lucetti ? " 

" To ask that ! But you have come from the 
mountains. Doesn't the world look curious to you 
after living with the crows so long ? " 

" Quite curious. But who is Lucetti ? " 

"Madame Lucetti. She is the great singer of 
the present moment; that is, of the present winter; 
the prima donna of the Italian opera." 

" Does she give concerts too ? " I asked innocently. 

Olive hesitated, and then said, " No." 

" 0, then you have not heard her." 

Olive paused again, longer this time, and looking up at me from her cup of chocolate, said, 

" I have heard her." 

" Where ? " 

" In La Sonnambula and  II Flauto magico. " 

" In the opera ? " said I, not believing my ears. 
" You do not mean in the opera ? " 

Olive nodded. " Why not ? I mean in the 
opera." 



 

" Olive, Olive, Olive ! " I cried, and could not 
Bay a word more. I was fairly gasping. 

"Why not? " repeated Olive coolly and eyeing me. 

" You know Mr. Iredell would not like it." 

" How do you know that ? " 

" I know. And you know." 

" It does not signify," said Olive. " People must 
go according to their different convictions. Mine 
are not the same as Mr. Iredell's. It does not follow that they are not as likely to be right." 

" But, Olive ! " and I stopped. " Does he know 
it?" 

" What ? that my convictions are not the same 
as his, on some points? Probably. He must be 
convinced of that by this time, I should think. 
That is no harm. Life would be stupid if every 
body thought alike." 

" No, no, Olive; I mean, does your husband know 
that you have been to the opera ? " 

" How you roll out those words my husband 
with solemn emphasis ! " said she laughing slightly. 
" They are very tremendous words to your inexpe 
rience, are they not ? " 

" Olive, don't laugh." 

"Why not?" 

" It is not a laughing matter." 

"That is how you look at it. It is a laughing 
matter to me to see your face when you say those 
words, your husband. When you have one of 
those articles for yourself, it will seem less terribly 
significant." 



 

" You do not. answer me," I observed. 

" I do not know why I should." 

" Then I am very glad I came from Chesterfield 
Olive, dear Olive, you must not do this." 

" Do what? " said she, eyeing me. 

"You must not try to do things unknown to Mr. 
Iredell. You must not, sister ! Nothing but trouble 
will come of it." 

Olive eyed me in a curious way. If I had not had 
a good conscience, I should not have liked it. 

"You think I should tell him everything I do, like 
a good little child? My dear, the relations between 
us are not of that sort. We do not live in the old 
times of social bondage; marriage leaves both husband and wife free now-a-days, within certain limits, to do their pleasure." 

" Not to each other's displeasure ? " 

Olive shrugged her shoulders. " That is as it may 
be. I cannot be bound by Mr. Iredell's conscience. 
In my judgment there is not the slightest harm in
going to the opera." 

" Against Mr. Iredell's wish ? " 

" I have not asked him! " 

"But you know it, without asking." 

" I cannot help that." 

" Olive, do not displease him ! " I said very 
earnestly. 

" What do you suppose he would do ? " she asked, 
with a curious half smile and that regarding look 
again. 

" I suppose he would be greatly grieved." 



 

" Pooh! nonsense ! About such a trifle." 

" He would not think it a trifle. And you do not. 
And if you love him, Olive, you will not try the 
question. No more will you, if you love your own 
happiness." 

" That will do," said she coldly. "We will say no 
more about it, if you please. You can say no more ; 
and I have no wish to discuss the subject further." 

We talked of other things accordingly, but I was 
extremely disturbed. I do not believe that game 
succeeds with most men; and that it would not 
succeed with Mr. Iredell I was very sure. 

We were scarcely seated at luncheon to-day, 
when Miss Forella came in. She came in as one 
familiar there; greeted me very coolly, but the 
master of the house with more observance. Olive, 
I thought, was hardly glad to see her. 

"So you took all your household to that stupid 
concert last night," she began, addressing Mr. Iredell. " Wasn't it awfully heavy ? " 

"You found it so?" said he calmly. 

" I thought it was dull," said Olive. 

" Dull ! If anything is dull, it is a violin, pure 
and simple, without anything to help it. Look at 
Miss Burgoyne's eyes ! " she burst out laughing. 
" It is good to see somebody from the country once 
in a while, who shews us how we onght to be af 
fected; we, blase and spoiled city people. I saw 
you last night," she went on, nodding at me. " It 
was a treat to look at you. I was quite near you 
all, though you didn't know it." 

 

"You enjoyed the music?" asked Mr. Iredell, 
looking at me now. 

" Enjoyed it ! " cried Ernestine. " You don't know 
what you lost by sitting off at one side as you did 
Enjoy ? Why, she was like an enchanted princess ; 
and she entered fairyland by the gates of her ears 
just as soon as ever the music began to play. Then 
sometimes the tears rolled down her face "
