" that all these things will drive you out of my 
mind." 

" Well, my dear, perhaps they will." 

" Please don't say that," Catherine answered, gen- 
tly, as they walked along. " Poor father will be dis- 
appointed." 

Morris gave a little laugh. " Yes, I verily believe 
that your poor father will be disappointed. But 
you will have seen Europe," he added, humorously. 
" What a take-in !" 

" I don't care for seeing Europe," Catherine said. 

" You ought to care, my dear ; and it may mol- 
lify your father." 

Catherine, conscious of her obstinacy, expected lit- 
tle of this, and could not rid herself of the idea that 
in going abroad and yet remaining firm, she should 





play her father a trick. " Don't you think it would 
be a kind of deception ?" she asked. 

" Doesn't he want to deceive you ?" cried Morris. 
"It will serve him right. I really think you had 
better go." 

" And not be married for so long ?" 

" Be married when you come back. You can buy 
your wedding-clothes in Paris." And then Morris, 
with great kindness of tone, explained his view of 
the matter. It would be a good thing that she 
should go; it would put them completely in the 
right. It would show they were reasonable, and 
willing to wait. Once they were so sure of each 
other, they could afford to wait what had they to 
fear ? If there was a particle of chance that her 
father would be favorably affected by her going, 
that ought to settle it ; for, after all, Morris was very 
unwilling to be the cause of her being disinherited. 
It was not for himself, it was for her and for her 
children. He was willing to wait for her ; it would 
be hard, but he could do it. And over there, among 
beautiful scenes and noble monuments, perhaps the 
old gentleman would be softened ; such things were 
supposed to exert a humanizing influence. He 
might be touched by her gentleness, her patience, 
her willingness to make any sacrifice but that one ; 
and if she should appeal to him some day, in some 
celebrated spot in Italy, say, in the evening ; in 
Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight if she should 
be a little clever about it, and touch the right chord, 
perhaps he would fold her in his arms, and tell her 
that he forgave her. Catherine was immensely 
struck with this conception of the affair, which 





seemed eminently worthy of her lover's brilliant in- 
tellect, though she viewed it askance in so far as it 
depended upon her own powers of execution. The 
idea of being " clever " in a gondola by moonlight 
appeared to her to involve elements of which her 
grasp was not active. But it was settled between 
them that she should tell her father that she was 
ready to follow him obediently anywhere, making 
the mental reservation that she loved Morris Towns- 
end more than ever. 

She informed the Doctor she was ready to em- 
bark, and he made rapid arrangements for this 
event. Catherine had many farewells to make, but 
with only two of them are we actively concerned. 
Mrs. Penniman took a discriminating view of her 
niece's journey ; it seemed to her very proper that 
Mr. Townsend's destined bride should wish to em- 
bellish her mind by a foreign tour. 

" You leave him in good hands," she said, press- 
ing her lips to Catherine's forehead. (She was very 
fond of kissing people's foreheads ; it was an invol- 
untary expression of sympathy with the intellectual 
part.) " I shall see him often ; I shall feel like one 
of the vestals of old tending the sacred flame." 

"You behave beautifully about not going with 
us," Catherine answered, not presuming to examine 
this analogy. 

" It is my pride that keeps me up," said Mrs. Pen- 
niman, tapping the body of her dress, which always 
gave forth a sort of metallic ring. 

Catherine's parting with her lover was short, and 
few words were exchanged. 

"Shall I find you just the same when I come 





back ?" she asked ; though the question was not the 
fruit of scepticism. 

" The same only more so," said Morris, smiling. 

It does not enter into our scheme to narrate in 
detail Doctor Sloper's proceedings in the Eastern 
hemisphere. He made the grand tour of Europe, 
travelled in considerable splendor, and (as was to 
have been expected in a man of his high cultivation) 
found so much in art and antiquity to interest him, 
that he remained abroad, not for six months, but for 
twelve. Mrs. Penniman, in Washington Square, 
accommodated herself to his absence. She enjoyed 
her uncontested dominion in the empty house, and 
flattered herself that she made it more attractive to 
their friends than when her brother was at home. 
To Morris Townsend, at least, it would have appear- 
ed that she made it singularly attractive. He was 
altogether her most frequent visitor, and Mrs. Pen- 
niman was very fond of asking him to tea. He had 
his chair a very easy one at the fireside in the 
back parlor (when the great mahogany sliding doors, 
with silver knobs and hinges, which divided this 
apartment from its more formal neighbor, were 
closed), and he used to smoke cigars in the Doctor's 
study, where he often spent an hour in turning over 
the curious collections of its absent proprietor. He 
thought Mrs. Penniman a goose, as we know ; but 
he was no goose himself, and, as a young man of 
luxurious tastes and scanty resources, he found the 
house a perfect castle of indolence. It became for 
him a club with a single member. Mrs. Penniman 
saw much less of her sister than while the Doctor 
was at home ; for Mrs. Almond had felt moved to 





tell her that she disapproved of her relations with 
Mr. Townsend. She had no business to be so 
friendly to a young man of whom their brother 
thought so meanly, and Mrs. Almond was surprised 
at her levity in foisting a most deplorable engage- 
ment upon Catherine. 

" Deplorable !" cried Lavinia. " He will make 
her a lovely husband." 

"I don't believe in lovely husbands," said Mrs. 
Almond ; " I only believe in good ones. If he mar- 
ries her, and she comes into Austin's money, they 
may get on. He will be an idle, amiable, selfish, 
and, doubtless, tolerably good-natured fellow. But 
if she doesn't get the money, and he finds himself 
tied to her, Heaven have mercy on her! He will 
have none. He will hate her for his disappoint- 
ment, and take his revenge ; he will be pitiless and 
cruel. Woe betide poor Catherine ! I recommend 
you to talk a little with his sister ; it's a pity Cathe- 
rine can't marry her!" 

Mrs. Penniman had no appetite whatever for 
conversation with Mrs. Montgomery, whose acquaint- 
ance she made no trouble to cultivate ; and the ef- 
fect of this alarming forecast of her niece's destiny 
was to make her think it indeed a thousand pities 
that Mr. Townsend's generous nature should be em- 
bittered. Bright enjoyment was his natural ele- 
ment, and how could he be comfortable if there 
should prove to be nothing to enjoy ? It became a 
fixed idea with Mrs. Penniman that he should yet en- 
joy her brother's fortune, on which she had acuteness 
enough to perceive that her own claim was small. 

" If he doesn't leave it to Catherine, it certainly 
won't be to leave it to me," she said.
