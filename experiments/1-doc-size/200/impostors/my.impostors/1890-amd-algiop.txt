Captain Nevitt.

"They went on up the Schuylkill, on the other side, to Whitemarsh first,
and then to Valley Forge."

"A blacksmithy town?"

"There was once an old forge there. It is not a town."

"There seems many comfortable country houses about, as if there might be
gentry."

"Some of them now are filled with the wounded and the ill. They were
worth seeing in the summer."

Then they discussed horses and found the young Quaker no mean authority.
The horn blew to summon them within, where a bountiful feast was spread,
to which they all did ample justice and talked of family affairs.
Captain Nevitt had another view of his father from his brother's
comprehension of him, and though it was much narrower, not less
complimentary than that of Madam Wetherill. Certainly there was nothing
to regret on the Henry side. He was beginning to feel proud of these
clean, wholesome people of strong character.

When they had risen Madam Wetherill said they must leave presently. The
sky was getting to be rather lowering, with a grayish cloud in the south
that betokened snow, Friend Henry said.

"I will go out with thee, Andrew, and see about the horses," said the
lady.

"Nay," interposed Captain Nevitt smilingly. "It is hardly a lady's
business----"

"I have some privacy with Andrew," she returned. "I have had some useful
hints from him, young as he is, and you must know if women are not
equipped for soldiering, they make excellent farmers at times. But you
may all come, though if I extract any grand secret from Andrew as to how
to double the value of a crop next year, I shall not bruit it abroad, I
promise you."

Faith looked up wistfully.

"Child," she said, "thou and Primrose go take a little run in the keen
air. Thou art not very rosy for a farmer's maid, and Primrose hath been
housed overmuch of late, our streets are so full of roysterers."

"Faith hath some work----"

"Nay," interposed Madam Wetherill, "ten minutes' run will make her all
the brisker for work. Run along, children; and have a little visit with
each other."

There was something in Madam Wetherill not easily gainsaid. Rachel saved
up her displeasure for a scolding presently.

Andrew attended the lady to the stalls where the horses had been led.

"Thou hast not been in to market of late?"

"There had been so much disorder, and I believe a permit is needed. Then
there have been people about, buying up produce of all kinds."

"Dost thou know anything of the other army?" Her voice was very low.

"Somewhat," in a hesitating tone.

"They are likely to need many things. Howe's purpose to attack them was
frustrated by a timely warning. There may be other warnings as well, for
the army contains many braggarts. And their winter of dissipation, of
gambling and betting and carousing, will not fit them for a spring
campaign. I heard it said that Philadelphia was capturing them by
allurements, and it may be a poor victory for General Howe. I have a
faith--I cannot tell thee of any tangible groundwork, but I feel assured
we shall win."

"It is dark enough now."

"But there was the splendid capture of Burgoyne, and our army made much
richer by stores sorely needed. Canst thou get things to Valley Forge?"

"I know of someone who can," and he studied her eyes.

"Even if it is gold--British gold? It will not stick to anyone's
fingers?"

"I will warrant that," and the delight encouraged her.

"I have a small fund that will come in from time to time. Here is a
little bag. It is not much, but it will help. And if I could get needful
things to them, clothes and blankets? If thou wilt sell provisions to me
for them--thy father keeps a sharp lookout?"

"He hath a shrewd mind and far sight. And I would not render him liable
to trouble. I think I could manage that way. Oh, madam, I ought to be
with those brave fellows whom nothing disheartens. The general's wife
hath left her pleasant, peaceful home to share his hardships. It is my
country."

"Wait a little and be patient. It is a pity this fine cousin is on the
wrong side. It would amuse thee to hear Primrose dispute with him. Now I
trust thee to get this gold thither."

"Thank thee a hundred times for them. There are many loyal hearts in
town, as I well know."

"And many disloyal ones. It angers me. Come in some time. Primrose will
be overjoyed to see thee. She is growing tall fast, too fast for my
pleasure. I would fain keep her a little girl."

"I am jealous of my cousin," declared Captain Nevitt coming out to them
with the air of a spoiled boy. "When wilt thou give me a confidence?"

"All the way home," she answered readily. "And I have so many good
points I think I shall bet on the next race. How many of you will ride?"

"Why do we not have some hunts?" he asked eagerly. "If there is no
fighting there must be diversion."

They mounted the ladies and rode up to the door of the cottage to say
good-by.

"I shall dream of thee to-night," Faith whispered to Primrose.

The wind blew up colder and sharper. They were glad to get home. There
was a slight fall of snow and everything was frozen up hard enough to
last all winter.

The streets seemed merrier than ever. All the creeks were frozen solid,
it seemed, and the Schuylkill was a sparkling white band, winding about.
Skating had broken out into fashion, and the prettiest belles of the day
were out with trains of military men at their beck. The river banks
would be lined with spectators, who envied, criticised, and carped.
Women were muffled up in furs and carried huge muffs, their wide hats
tied down under their chins with great bows, some wearing the silken
mask, in much the fashion of a veil, to protect their skins from frosty
touches. The skaters, in skirts that betrayed trim and slender ankles,
spun along like a whirl of the wind, or with hands crossed with a
partner, went through graceful rocking evolutions, almost like a waltz.

The scarlet uniforms of the officers made a brilliant pageant. It was
indeed a winter long to be remembered, and recalled with keen relish
when the British, with lovers and friends, had flown.

Captain Nevitt had insisted upon taking his sister out, as Primrose was
a very fair skater, and, under his tuition, improved wonderfully. She
looked so pretty in her skating dress with her soft, yellow hair flying
in the wind, and her lovely face half hidden in her hat, to be revealed
like a vision at the various turns.

Nevitt had been taken on General Howe's staff for the present. Foiled in
his endeavor to call out Washington by any maneuver, and feeling that
another battle was quite impossible and useless in the extreme cold,
which was more bitter than for years, he too, gave himself over to
diversion, and looked leniently on the frivolities of his officers and
the ruder dissipations of his men.

The most fascinating game on the ice was skating after a ball. A man
called the hurlie propelled half a dozen balls along with a long,
sharp-pointed stick, between two given points, often far enough apart to
make a trial of speed and endurance. The fortunate one was he or she who
caught a ball before it reached the goal, and then the merriest shout
would ring out on the air.

A tall, fine-looking young fellow in civilian attire had captured two of
the balls one afternoon and was flying at his most vigorous speed for
another. Primrose had paused for a moment while her brother stopped to
chaff a companion. The ball rolled swiftly along, and from some slight
inequality in the ice deflected. The arm was outstretched to catch it,
and she could not quite remember afterward whether she had stooped, but
he came against her with sufficient force to knock her over. He caught
the ball and held it up in triumph, with a joyous hurrah, and then
turned to see what the oath and the exclamation meant.

"Good Heavens! you have killed her, you brute!" Captain Nevitt cried
angrily.

"I was under such headway and I had no thought the ball would go in that
direction. Let us see at once. Is she unconscious? Dr. Shippen is here.
I passed him not ten seconds ago. I will find him."

Nevitt took Primrose in his arms, limp and white as a lily. There was a
little circle about them, but the others went on with their gayety. A
fall was no such uncommon thing.

Dr. Shippen had been out for a little exercise, and withal had some
curiosity to see the mad carnival that had broken out in the staid city.

"Ah, it is Madam Wetherill's little girl!" looking sharply at Nevitt.

"I thought I had seen the child somewhere," said the young man who had
caused the accident. "Can we not take her home at once?"

"I am her brother," was Nevitt's stiff reply. "You have done enough
mischief with your awkwardness. I hope your silly victory repays you.
Let me pass, with no further parley on your part."

"What do you think, Dr. Shippen?"

"It is a faint, of course. Whether she is more severely injured I cannot
