CHAPTER XVI. 

WHO WINS ? 

THE June day on which Harle College 
competed for the highest oratorical prize of 
the course dawned gloriously. A well-regulated 
excitement pervaded the whole institu 
tion. The boys usually behaved very well 
on that day. The honor appertaining to 
the De Courtney was felt to be great. The 
prize was a long-established one, full of his 
toric interest. Some of the most eminent 
men in America, in politics, in the bar, in 
the pulpit, had been De Courtney men in 
Junior year at Harle. Even Marcy 's preoc 
cupied father had blazed out in a little flash 
of interest in his son 's chances. He wrote : 

" It 's the thing, you know, it 's quite the 
thing, De Courtney. It will help you on. It 
will give you prestige. I will come on, if I can 
possibly get off. Your mother sends her best 
wishes, and regrets. She would come, if it were 
not for the condition of her spine or her heart, 
I forget which. She is quite under the weather 
just now." 



 

Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Marcy was present 
to hear Donald, but many strangers were. 
Guests came from near and far. Each one of 
the other competitors was honored by a group 
of adoring relatives, all believing that their 
individual darling was sure to be the suc 
cessful man. Many visitors, also, came 
from a merely general interest in the occasion, 
which was always a pleasant one to 
the university town and its suburbs. 

Summer toilets filled the streets, and glis 
tened in the packed hall. Smiling nods and 
bright eyes dotted the audience with little 
sparks of good humor and expectation. The 
house was thronged. An hour before two 
o clock, not a seat was to be had. 

Dr. Fleet had come on from Vermont, 
and was securely packed away by Jamie in 
one of the seats of honor by half-past one. 
A reserved seat was empty beside him. It 
was a great event for the minister to take 
that journey to Harle. But Dr. Fleet had a 
very important engagement at Smith Col 
lege the day before. Fay was graduating. 
Besides, he said that he thought he'd better 
see Jamie, who was going to the seaside to
tutor some boys directly after Commencement, 
and would not be in Tipton till who knew 







when? Jamie knew very well that his 
father would not have lost the chance to 
hear his " other boy " compete for the De 
Courtney, if he had to wear his old overcoat 
all winter to make up for the travel 
ing expense. It was a " real trial " (so she 
said, and she seldom said that of anything) 
to gentle Mrs. Fleet not to go, too ; but 
that was out of the question. She had to 
content herself with sewing and praying for 
Fay. As for Donald, Mrs. Fleet wrote 
him the prettiest little good-luck note in the 
world, and made him a special necktie for 
the occasion out of a piece of her wedding- 
dress. 

Jamie himself was keenly excited. He 
was as pale as if he had been going to speak 
himself ; paler than Don, whose rich, live 
color was a trifle abated, but no more. 
Jamie hovered over Don till the last mo 
ment, with his lingering, loving eyes, then 
wrung his hand hard, said, " Good luck to 
you, old boy ! " and pulled his hat over his 
eyes and ran off. Donald was in the green 
room. He called after his chum : 

" Say ! You 'll take a carriage from the 
station? Put it on my bill, please. Oh, 
come ! you will, won't you ? " 



 



" Y-yes," answered Jamie "if you want 
it so much." 

" And be sure you're in plenty of time," 
cried Don nervously. u Get in early, sure 
pop ! " 

Nobody had ever seen Don nervous before. 
But when it came quarter of two o clock he 
was to be seen fidgeting up and down in 
front of the hall at a great rate. The green 
room couldn't hold him. The boy, in his 
dress-suit, with Mrs. Fleet 's wedding-tie
exquisitely knotted under his well-cut chin, 
and the blue ribbon binding The Influence 
of Imagination upon Science sticking out 
from his breast pocket, marched to and fro 
with a restlessness not calculated to calm 
the nerve that was to win the great De 
Courtney prize. 

Fifteen minutes ! ten minutes before 
two ! Where was Jamie ? What could 
this mean ? Nine minutes eight seven ! 
Don dashed his watch into his pocket in a 
rage of anxiety. Six minutes ! 

Ah, there ! A carriage rolling madly up 
the blazing, dusty road ! It dashed up, the 
door was flung open, and Jamie leaped out, 
wiping his hot face, and looking as if he had 
been the horse, and had pulled that hack the 
whole wav- 





" Train late ! " he panted. " Go in, Don, 
go in ! Father 'll keep the seat. She 's all 
right." 

A pretty figure in a plain, pale-brown, sum 
mer traveling-dress, and little, brown straw 
bonnet, with a dash of blue in it, jumped 
after Jamie and held out both hands to Don, 
impulsively. She held a blue fan in one. 
Blue was Fay 's color. 

" I thought you'd never come ! " cried 
Donald rapturously. " I shall get it now, 
I shall win, now you're here." 

" Of course you 'll win, anyhow ! " said 
Fay, blushing delightfully. They talked in 
ecstatic snatches as Jamie hurried them 
toward the hall. 

" So you graduated yesterday ! " 

" Wasn't it nice ? That 's why I could 
come to-day." 

" It 's cruel I couldn't come. But you 
see I couldn't. You don't look a bit more 
learned, that I see. You haven't got that 
Greek expression yet." 

" Greek met Greek, sir, I don't need it. 
Are you scared ? " 

" Not a bit. I was a little. I'm not 
now." 

" Good-luck go with you, Mr. Don ! I 



 

asked that you should get it," said Fay, in 
a low, sober tone. 

"You asked?" 

She nodded. Then Donald understood 
that Fay had been praying that he might 
succeed on that great day. 

But Jamie dragged her off then. Donald 
wruiiff her hand and dashed back to the 


green-room, and tried to cool his emotions in
