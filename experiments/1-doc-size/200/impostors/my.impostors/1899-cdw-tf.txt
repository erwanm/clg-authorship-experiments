could be explained to her, without putting her 
in terror hourly, why she must always be watched 
and guarded. 

It had required all the tact and sophistry of 
her governess to make her acquiesce in a system 
of education — so it was called — that had been de- 
vised in order to give her the highest and purest 
development. That the education was mainly 
left to McDonald, and that her parents were 
simply anxious about her safety, she did not 
learn till long afterwards. In the first years 
Mrs. Mavick had been greatly relieved to be 
spared all the care of the baby, and as the years 
went on the arrangement seemed more and more 
convenient, and she gave little thought to the 
character that was being formed. To Mr. Ma- 
vick, indeed, as to his wife, it was enough to see 
that she was uncommonly intelligent, and that 
she had a certain charm that made her attrac- 
tive. Mrs. Mavick took it for granted that Avhen 
it came time to introduce her into the world she 
would be like other girls, eager for its pleasures 
and susceptible to all its allurements. Of the di- 
rection of the undercurrents of the girl's life she 
had no conception, until she began to unfold to 
her the views of the world that prevailed in her 
circle, and what (in the Carmen scheme of life) 
ought to be a woman's ambition. 




 

That she was to be an heiress Evelyn had long 
known, that she Avould one day have a great 
fortune at her disposal had indeed come into her 
serious thought, but the brilliant use of it in re- 
lation to herself, at which her mother was always 
lately hinting, came to her as a disagreeable 
shock. For the moment the fortune seemed to 
her rather a fetter than an opportunity, if she 
was to fulfil her mother's expectations. These 
hints were conveyed with all the tact of Avhich 
her mother was master, but the girl was never- 
theless somewhat alarmed, and she began to re- 
gard the " coming out " as an entrance into servi- 
tude rather than an enlargement of liberty. One 
day she surprised Miss McDonald by asking her 
if she didn't think that rich people were the only 
ones not free to do as they pleased ? 

"Why, my dear, it is not generally so con- 
sidered. Most people fancy that if they had 
money enough they could do anything." 

" Yes, of course," said the girl, putting down 
her stitching and looking up ; " that is not exactly 
what I mean. They can go in the current, they 
can do what they like with their money, but I 
mean with themselves. Aren't they in a condi- 
tion that binds them half the time to do what 
they don't wish to do?" 

" It's a condition that all the world is trying 
to get into." 





 

"I know. I've been talking with mamma 
about the world and about society, and what is 
expected and what you must live up to." 

" But you have always known that you must 
one day go into the world and take your share 
in hfe." 

"That, yes. But I would rather liye up to 
myself. Mamma seems to think that society 
will do a great deal for me, that I will get a 
wider view of life, that I can do so much for so- 
ciety, and, with my position, mamma says, have 
such a career. McDonald, what is society for?" 

That was such a poser that the governess 
threw up her hands, and then laughed aloud, and 
then shook her head. " Wiser people than you 
have asked that question." 

" I asked mamma that, for she is in it all the 
time. She didn't like it much, and asked, ' "What 
is anything for?' You see, McDonald, I've been 
with mamma many a time when her friends 
came to see her, and they never have anything 
to say, never — what I call anything. I wonder 
if in society they go about saying that? "What 
do they do it for?" 

Miss McDonald had her own opinion about 
what is called society and its occupations and 
functions, but she did not propose to encourage 
this girl, who would soon take her place in it, in 
such odd notions. 





 

" Don't you know, child, that there is society 
and society? That it is all sorts of a world, that 
it gets into groups and circles about, and that is 
the way the world is stirred up and kept from 
stagnation. And, my dear, you have just to do 
your duty where you are placed, and that is all 
there is about it." 

" Don't be cross, McDonald. I suppose I can 
think my thoughts?" 

" Yes, you can think, and you can learn to keep 
a good deal that you think to yourself. 'Now, 
Evelyn, haven't you any curiosity to see what 
this world we are talking about is like?" 

" Indeed I have," said Evelyn, coming out of 
her reflective mood into a girlish enthusiasm. 
" And I want to see what I shall be like in it. 
Only — well, how is that?" And she held out the 
handkerchief she had been plying her needle on. 

Miss McDonald looked at the stitches critically, 
at the letters T.M. enclosed in an oval. 

" That is very good, not too mechanical. It will 
please your father. The oval makes a pretty ef- 
fect; but what are thosesigns between theletters?" 

"Don't you see? It is a cartouche, and those 
are hieroglyphics — his name in Egyptian. I got 
it out of Petrie's book." 

" It certainly is odd." 

" And every one of the twelve is going to be 
different. It is so interesting to hunt up the

signs for qualities. If papa can read it he will 
find out a good deal that I think about him." 

The governess only smiled for reply. It was 
so like Evelyn, so different from others even in 
the commonplace task of marking handkerchiefs, 
to work a little archaeology into her expression 
of family affection. 

Mrs. Maviok's talks with her daughter in 
which she attempted to give Evelyn some con- 
ception of her importance as the heiress of a 
great fortune, of her position in society, what 
would be expected of her, and of the brilliant 
social career her mother imagined for her, had 
an effect opposite to that intended. There had 
been nothing in her shielded life, provided for at 
every step without effort, that had given her any 
idea of the value and importance of money. 

To a girl in her position, educated in the ordi- 
nary way and mingling with school companions, 
one of the earliest lessons would be a comprehen- 
sion of the power that wealth gave her ; and by 
the time that she was of Evelyn's age her opinion 
of men would begin to be colored by the notion 
that they were polite or attentive to her on ac- 
count of her fortune and not for any charm of 
hers, and so a cruel suspicion of selfishness would 
have entered her mind to poison the very thought 
of love. 

No such idea had entered Evelyn's mind. She
