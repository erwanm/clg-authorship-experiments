of England ; and poor Bessie Alden, like many 
a Yankee maiden, was terribly at the mercy of 
picturesqueness. 

" I have often wished I were at Newport again," 
said the young man. "Those days I spent at 
your sister 's were awfully jolly." 

" We enjoyed them very much ; I hope your 
father is better." 

" Oh dear, yes. When I got to England, he 
was out grouse-shooting. It was what you call in 
America a gigantic fraud. My mother had got 
nervous. My three weeks at Newport seemed like 
a happy dream." 

" America certainly is very different from England," said Bessie. 

"I hope you like England better, eh?" Lord 
Lambeth rejoined, almost persuasively. 

"No Englishman can ask that seriously of a 
person of another country." 

Her companion looked at her for a moment. 
" You mean it 's a matter of course ?" 

" If I were English," said Bessie, " it would cer 
tainly seem to me a matter of course that every 
one should be a good patriot." 

" Oh dear, yes, patriotism is every thing," said 





Lord Lambeth, not quite following, but very contented. " Now, what are you going to do here ?" 

" On Thursday I am going to the Tower." 

"The Tower?" 

" The Tower of London. Did you never hear 
of it?" 

" Oh yes, I have been there," said Lord Lam 
beth. "I was taken there by my governess when 
I was six years old. It 's a rum idea, your going 
there." 

" Do give me a few more rum ideas," said Bessie. " I want to see every thing of that sort. I 
am going to Hampton Court, and to Windsor, and 
to the Dulwich Gallery." 

Lord Lambeth seemed greatly amused. "I 
wonder you don 't go to the Rosherville Gardens." 

" Are they interesting ?" asked Bessie. 

" Oh, wonderful." 

"Are they very old? That 's all I care for," 
said Bessie. 

" They are tremendously old ; they are all falling 
to ruins." 

" I think there is nothing so charming as an old 
ruinous garden," said the young girl. " We must 
certainly go there." 

Lord Lambeth broke out into merriment. " I 
say, Woodley," he cried, " here 's Miss Alden wants 
to go to the Rosherville Gardens !" 



  

Willie Woodley looked a little blank ; he was 
caught in the fact of ignorance of an apparently 
conspicuous feature of London life. But in a 
moment he turned it off. " Very well," he said, 
" I'll write for a permit." 

Lord Lambeth 's exhilaration increased. " Gad, 
I believe you Americans would go any where !" ho 
cned. 

" We wish to go to Parliament," said Bessie. 
" That 's one of the first things." 

u Oh, it would bore you to death !" cried the 
young man. 

"We wish to hear you speak." 

"I never speak except to young ladies," said 
Lord Lambeth, smiling. 

Bessie Alden looked at him a while, smiling, too, 
in the shadow of her parasol. "You are very 
strange," she murmured. " I don 't think I ap 
prove of you." 

"Ah, now, don 't be severe, Miss Alden," said 
Lord Lambeth, smiling still more. " Please don 't 
be severe. I want you to like me awfully." 

" To like you awfully ? You must not laugh 
at me, then, when I make mistakes. I consider 
it my right as a free-born American to make 
as many mistakes as I choose." 

 Upon my word, I didn 't laugh at you," said 
Lord Lambeth. 





" And not only that," Bessie went on ; "but I 
hold that all my mistakes shall be set down to my 
credit. You must think the better of me for them." 

"I can 't think better of you than I do," the 
young man declared. 

Bessie Alden looked at him a moment again. 
" You certainly speak very well to young ladies. 
But why don 't you address the House ? isn't that 
what they call it ?" 

"Because I have nothing to say," said Lord Lambeth. 

" Haven't you a great position ?" asked Bessie 
Alden. 

He looked a moment at the back of his glove. 
" I'll set that down," he said, " as one of your mistakes to your credit." And as if he disliked 
talking about his position, he changed the subject. 
" I wish you would let me go with you to the Tower, and to Hampton Court, and to all those other 
places." 

" We shall be most happy," said Bessie. 

" And of course I shall be delighted to show 
you the House of Lords some day that suits you. 
There are a lot of things I want to do for you. I 
want to make you have a good time. And I should 
like very much to present some of my friends to 
you, if it wouldn 't bore you. Then it would be 
awfully kind of you to come down to Branches." 



  

" We are much obliged to you, Lord Lambeth," 
said Bessie. " What is Branches ?" 

" It 's a house in the country. I think you might 
like it." 

Willie Woodley and Mrs. Westgate at this mo 
ment were sitting in silence, and the young man 's 
ear caught these last words of Lord Lambeth's. 
"He 's inviting Miss Bessie to one of his castles," 
he murmured to his companion. 

Mrs. Westgate, foreseeing what she mentally 
called " complications," immediately got up ; and 
the two ladies, taking leave of Lord Lambeth, returned, under Mr. Woodley 's conduct, to Jones 's 
Hotel. 

Lord Lambeth came to see them on the morrow, 
bringing Percy Beaumont with him the latter 
having instantly declared his intention of neglecting none of the usual offices of civility. This declaration, however, when his kinsman informed him 
of the advent of their American friends, had been 
preceded by another remark. 

" Here they are, then, and you are in for it." 

" What am I in for ?" demanded Lord Lambeth. 

" I will let your mother give it a name. With 
all respect to whom," added Percy Beaumont, " I 
must decline on this occasion to do any more police duty. Her Grace must look after you her 
self." 



" I will give her a chance," said her Grace 
a trifle grimly. " I shall make her go and see 
them." 

" She won 't do it, my boy."
