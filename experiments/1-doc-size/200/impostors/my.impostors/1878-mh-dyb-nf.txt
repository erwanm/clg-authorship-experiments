MÉLANGE SOUP.

  1 cup of rice (scant).
  3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef.
  Some mutton bones.
  2 carrots.
  2 turnips.
  1 onion.
  Essence of celery, two teaspoonfuls.
  Pepper and salt.
  4 quarts of cold water.
  1 cup of tomato-juice.

Cut the meat into dice, and put on in the water. Boil gently two hours,
when add the rice, tomato-juice, and the vegetables cut into small
squares, and already cooked five minutes in hot water, to take off
the rank taste. Stew half an hour, or until the vegetables and rice
are tender, but not a pulp; season; boil up once and pour out—meat,
vegetables, and all—into the tureen.


Ragoût of Mutton.

  3 lbs. of mutton—lean and boneless—cut into strips four inches long
          by one inch wide.
  1 cup of gravy, made of bones, etc.
  A tablespoonful of walnut catsup.
  Browned flour.
  Salt and pepper.
  1 slice of lemon.
  Parsley.
  A slice of ham or fat pork, cut small.
  Dripping.

Fry the mutton to a nice brown, quickly, in the dripping. Lay in a
saucepan, the chopped ham upon it, and cover with the gravy, highly
seasoned. Stew slowly until very tender; take up, and keep hot, while
you add the lemon to the gravy, with the catsup. Boil five minutes;
strain, and return the gravy to the saucepan. Thicken, and put in the
parsley minced fine. Boil up, and pour over the meat in a flat dish.
Put sippets of fried bread around the edge of the dish.


CANNED CORN PUDDING.

  1 can of corn, drained.
  3 eggs.
  2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.
  1 tablespoonful of sugar.
  A little salt.
  2 cupfuls of milk.
  1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet up in the milk.

Beat eggs, sugar, and butter together; then add the corn. Salt the
milk, and dissolve the corn-starch well in it, and pour, by degrees,
upon the rest, mixing well. Bake in a greased bake-dish three-quarters
of an hour. Keep covered until nearly done; then, brown.


BAKED TOMATOES.

Drain off the liquor from a can of tomatoes, and put it into your soup.
Pare the crust from some slices of bread, cut them to fit the bottom
of a greased pie-dish, and fry to a light brown in dripping. Dip each
in boiling, salted milk, fit to their places in the dish, pour the
tomatoes upon them, season with pepper, salt, butter, and a little
sugar. Strew thickly with crumbs, and bake, covered, twenty minutes;
then, brown.


PEACH BATTER PUDDING.

  1 quart of milk.
  2 cups of prepared flour, or enough for soft batter.
  4 beaten eggs.
  1 tablespoonful of butter, slightly warmed.
  1 saltspoonful of salt.
  1 can of peaches, drained.

Lay the drained peaches in a buttered bake-dish. Salt the flour, and
sift into a pan. Beat eggs and butter together, stir in the milk, and
pour, by degrees, into a hole in the middle of the flour, until you
have a smooth batter. Pour upon the peaches, and bake in a brisk oven.
Add a glass of brandy to the peach syrup; sweeten to taste; stir in two
tablespoonfuls of butter, and set in boiling water until the butter is
melted. Serve the pudding in the bake-dish and eat with this sauce.

EEL SOUP.

  4 lbs. of eels.
  1 onion.
  12 whole peppers.
  3 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  Tablespoonful of chopped parsley.
  1 cup of milk.
  2 tablespoonfuls of flour, rubbed into the butter.
  2 quarts of water.
  2 slices of toast cut into strips.
  Dripping.

Clean the eels with care, removing all the fat; cut them into short
pieces, and fry for five minutes in dripping. Drain, put into a
saucepan with the water, onion, and pepper, and stew slowly one hour,
or until they are tender, without breaking. Strain through a colander;
pick out the eels and cover in a tureen, the bottom of which is lined
with strips of buttered toast. Strain the soup, through a soup-sieve,
back into the saucepan; heat, and stir in butter, flour, and parsley.
Boil up, add the milk, already heated, and pour over the eels and toast.


BOILED CHICKEN.

Clean and stuff as for roasting. Bind legs and wings to the sides; tie
in a net, and put on in boiling water—if tender. If doubtful, use cold
water, and cook very slowly. When the fork-test shows that it is done,
unwrap and lay on a dish. Salt, pepper, and butter well, and cover
while preparing the sauce. Take out a cup of the liquor, cool, and
skim, put on in a saucepan; put in a tablespoonful of butter, rolled
in flour, and stir to a boil. Take off, and pour gradually over two
beaten eggs. Return to the fire, with minced parsley, almost boil,
and pour over the fowl.

Salt the liquor and set aside for soup.


POTATOES À LA CRÈME.

Mash thin, whip up with a fork, at first, with butter, salt, and milk;
at last, with the frothed white of an egg. Heap roughly upon a dish,
set upon the upper grating of the oven until they begin to color, and
serve.


RICE CROQUETTES.

  2 cups cold boiled rice.
  2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.
  2 beaten eggs.
  1 tablespoonful of flour.
  1 raw egg, and some cracker dust.
  2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.
  A pinch of grated lemon peel, and the same of nutmeg.
  Lard for frying.

Work the butter into the rice, then the seasoning, lastly, the beaten
eggs. Make into long balls, roll in egg, then in powdered cracker, and
fry, a few at a time, in hot lard.


STEAMED CORN-MEAL PUDDING.

  2 cups Indian meal.
  1 cup of flour.
  2 tablespoonfuls of white sugar.
  2½ cups of “loppered” milk, or buttermilk.
  1 teaspoonful of soda, sifted twice through the flour.
  1 teaspoonful of salt.
  1 heaping tablespoonful of butter, melted.

Put meal, flour, salt, sugar, and soda in a bowl; mix thoroughly; make
a hole in the middle and work in the milk and butter. Beat hard and
long when all are in; put into a buttered mould with a tight top, and
steam one hour and a half. If you have no regular steamer, fit the
mould in the top of a pot of boiling water, taking care it does not
hang into the water. Lay a thick wet towel, folded, over the top of
the mould to keep in all the heat. Or, you may simply boil it. Eat hot,
with butter and sugar.
