read into, seeing it in an awful light, something 
that has just befallen him. It seems to me that 
I get it and give it, for my best interest, by our 
having it all in the form in which her taxing him 
with being in a state, a state that she divines, 
yet but only half understands, determines his 
at last more or less abjectly confessing to. He 
breaks down under the beautiful pity of her 
divination, the wonder of her so feeling for him 
that she virtually knows, or knows enough; and 
the question is here of course, isn't it ? whether 





  

for full lucidity of interest, full logic of movement, 
he doesn't let her know all or, in vulgar fictional 
parlance, reveal his secret. That's what it comes 
to, what it has to come to, very much indeed it 
would seem; that's what the situation would 
seem to mean, would appear to have to give, as 
who should say, of finest: their being face to 
face over all the prodigious truth which I think 
there ought to be a magnificent scene a faire in 
illustration of. The beauty, the pathos, the 
terror of it dwells thus in his throwing himself 
upon her for help for help to "get out,'   literally, 
help which she can somehow give him. The 
logic, the exquisite, of this to be kept tight hold 
of, with one's finger on every successive link of 
the chain. But voyons un peu the logic; which, 
expressed in the plainest, the most mathematical 
terms possible, is that what this "retributive" 
admonition signifies for him is, he feels, that he 
is going to be left, handed over to the conditions 
of where and what and above all when he is; 
never saved, never rescued, never restored again, 
by the termination of his adventure and his ex 
perience, to his native temporal conditions, which 
he yearns for with an unutterable yearning. He 
has come to have his actual ones, the benighted, 
the dreadful ones, in horror and he just lets her 
know how horrible everything that surrounds 
her, everything that she herself is surrounded 
with and makes part of, have become for him, 





  

and under what a weight of despair he sinks if 
what has just again for the third time happened 
to him means that his fate is sealed. He breaks 
down to her, has the one outward, the one com 
municated despair that I see for him in the course 
of the affair; his throwing himself upon her for 
what she can do to avert that doom, his beseech 
ing her, all selfishly, to help him. I say all selfishly 
for the dramatic, clumsily so to call it, value, 
working value, of this; connected, identical, as 
it is with his readiness, in fact his intense hope 
of being able to, profit by the idea of a liberation 
for him purchased on her part by some sacrifice 
sacrifice, by no means sufficiently, of any hope 
of him, but of the very stuff of herself, and this 
up to the hilt. The more I look into this, the 
more I see in it; but with proportionately much 
therefore to be stated about it with a supreme 
lucidity. Reduced to its simplest expression, the 
case stands that he has fallen in love with her 
done so in absolute rebound from the distress 
that her sister's, her mother's, breach has brought 
to an end for him; leaving him originally to throw 
himself so much on her by reaction, by already 
acquired and assimilated sense that with her, too 
blessedly, almost any ease for him, whether but 
comparatively or absolutely, is possible. Thus 
had he given way to his having, as who should 
say, fallen in love with her; and thus does that 
fact work, to his perception, both toward his 





  

prime relief and toward his understanding of 
what he has to fear. Here I come to something 
pretty intricate and difficult, yet full of life and 
force, say frankly of beauty, if I can get it straight; 
which is what I must proceed to. Why has what 
passes, what has passed up to then, between this 
pair, why does it bring on or draw down the third, 
the "retributive" recurrence? Well, let us see 
if we don't make out, and thereby but store up 
still more beauty and intensity. Put it simply 
for the moment that the Predecessor has been 
in love with the elder sister while, all unknowably 
(at the time,) the younger has been in love with 
him. That condition on her part, it appears to 
me, gives the link I want, the exact one, for what 
Ralph finds of prepared, as it were, of reciprocal, 
of ground laid, for his first understandings with 
her when once he has begun to feel the interfering 
malaise of the others. I am here, I quite recognise, 
brought up against the question of why if the 
Predecessor has been so in love, then and there, 
in the old time, he should have had this impulse 
to swing off into conditions so remote from those 
of the object of this sentiment. I get partly in 
answer to this the fact that Ralph, shown as so 
much in love in the first Book, has all the same 
embraced his opportunity to swing off into where 
we now have him; but I want something more 
than this, and I don't get it by simply leaning 
strongly on the attachment inspired in the man 





  

of 1820; inasmuch as the more he has been at 
tached the more explaining will the matter take, 
the matter flowering into that inordinate phe 
nomenon of the original nocturnal meeting of the 
two men. If I give full value to the idea that 
the present Pendrel's pressure, his hovering, 
penetrating force has had much the most to do 
with what has taken place, that though the 
man of 1820 has drawn the man of 1910, exact, 
(though as to this I must make no modern date 
explicit of that) back into his own age, while 
the latter has drawn the former forward into 
his, though I do this, I take care, I soigner the 
effect that Ralph has begun it, has exerted the 
original force, has been the determinant for the 
other and thrust at him his opportunity. This 
in a general way clears up a little the particular 
aspect of the case that I am turning over; but 
don't I still nevertheless want something more 
than that ? I want something that the prede 
cessor may affect Ralph as definitely uttering to 
him and direfully reproaching him with; and 
perhaps as I dig into my material and insist on 
gouging what I want out of it I meet this ground 
of resentment and reprobation for the predecessor 
that he feels, or rather that Ralph feels him to 
feel for it can all only be imputation on R's part 
that he isn't, as it were, playing the game; 
ceases quite to play it from the moment that he 
inspires the elder girl, whom one had hit it off so 






  

with dans le temps, with the alarm of distress 
and dislike that has operated for her rupture. I 
find something in that, I find I think enough in 
that find it enough that Ralph recognises him 
self as under displeasure, under vindictive dis 
pleasure for not, as it were, playing the game. 
Let me make him put it for himself that the other 
man doesn't play the game either, from the mo 
ment that he thus "comes in," reappears, as 
it were, as with the conscious purpose so to 
"brouiller" things. Have it clear that Ralph 
has no theory at all of what his double's situa 
tion is off in his sphere; put it that he is by way 
of having no sort of constructive or inferential 
or divinatory notion of that at all: which it would 
make an extraordinary complication to under 
take to give him by which I mean an impossible 
one, an unspeakable tangle, within the limits, 
altogether. Yes, yes; the more I think the more 
I seem to see this conception of Ralph's to be 
that the other fellow is endangered and incom 
moded in his sphere by what strikes him as R's 
practical perfidy and non-accomplishment. What 
"Tnakes this is that the two women, the two other 
men etc., and the object of his preference above 
all, are thereby handed over to their intensity of 
malaise I give Ralph as seeing and feeling and 
understanding him as rendered thereby vindictive, 
as convicting him accordingly of "perfidy," and 
of decreeing the punishment which shall consist
