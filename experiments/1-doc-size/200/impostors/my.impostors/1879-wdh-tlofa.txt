" Let me introduce you to my niece, Colonel 
Pazzelli," said Mrs. Erwin. 

" Ah ! Too much honor, too much honor ! " 
murmured the cavaliere. He brought his heels to- 
gether with a click, and drooped towards Lydia till 
his head was on a level with his hips. Recovering 
himself, he caught up his eye-glasses, and bent them 
on Lydia. " Very please, very honored, much " — 
He stopped, and looked confused, and Lydia turned 
pale and red. 

" Now, won't you play that pretty barcarole you 
played the other night at Lady Fenleigh's ? " en- 
treated Mrs. Erwin. 

Colonel Pazzelli wrenched himself from the fasci- 
nation of Lydia's presence, and lavished upon Mrs. 
Erwin the hoarded English of a week. " Yes, 
yes ; very nice, very good. With much pleasure. 
I thank you. Yes, I play." He was one of those 
natives who in all the great Italian cities haunt 
English-speaking societies ; they try to drink tea 
without grimacing, and sing for the ladies of our 
race, who innocently pet them, finding them so 
very like other women in their lady-like sweet- 
ness and softness ; it is said they boast among their 
own countrymen of their triumphs. The cavaliere 
unbuckled his sword, and laying it across a chair 
sat down at the piano. He played not one but 
many barcaroles, and seemed loath to leave the in- 
strument. 

" Now, Lydia," said Mrs. Erwin, fondly, " won't 
you sing us something ? " 



 

" Do I " called Mr. Rose-Black from the sofa, 
with the intonation of a spoiled first-cousin, or half- 
brother. 

" I don't feel like singing to-day," answered 
Lydia, immovably. Mrs. Erwin was about to urge 
her further, bat other people came in, — some Jew- 
ish ladies, and then a Russian, whom Lydia took at 
first for an American. They all came and went, 
but Mr. Rose-Black remained in his corner of the 
sofa, and never took his eyes from Lydia's face. 
At last he went, and then Mr. Erwin looked in. 

" Is that beast gone ? " he asked. " I shall be 
obliged to show him the door, yet, Josephine. 
You ought to snub him. He 's worse than his pict- 
ures. Well, you 've had a whole raft of folks to- 
day, — as your countrymen say." * 

" Yes, thank Heaven," cried Mrs. Erwin, " and 
they 're all gone. I don't want Lydia to think 
that I let everybody come to see me on Sunday. 
Thursday is my day, Lydia, but a few privileged 
friends understand that they can drop in Sunday 
afternoon." She gave Lydia a sketch of the life 
and character of each of these friends. " And 
now I must tell you that your manner is very good, 
Lydia. That reserved way of yours is quite the 
thing for a young girl in Europe : I suppose it 's a 
gift ; I never could get it, even when I ivas a girl. 
But you mustn 't show any hauteur, even when you 
dislike people, and you refused to sing with rather 
too much aplomb. I don't suppose it was noticed, 



 

though, — those ladies coming in at the same time. 
Really, I thought Mr. Rose-Black and Colonel 
Pazzelli were trying to outstare each other ! It 
was certainly amusing. I never saw such an evi- 
dent case, Lydia ! The poor cavaliere looked as if 
he had seen you somewhere before in a dream, and 
was struggling to make it all out." 

Lydia remained impassive. Presently she said 
she would go to her room, and write home before 
dinner. When she went out Mrs. Erwin fetched a 
deep sigh, and threw herself upon her husband's 
sympathy. 

" She 's terribly unresponsive," she began. " I 
supposed she 'd be in raptures with the place, at 
least, but you wouldn 't know there was anything 
at all remarkable in Venice from anything she 's 
said. We have met ever so many interesting 
people to-day, — the Countess Tatocka, and Lady 
Fenleigh, and Miss Landini, and everybody, but I 
don't really think she 's said a word about a soul. 
She 's too queer for anything." 

" I dare say she hasn 't the experience to be 
astonished from," suggested Mr. Erwin easily. 
" She 's here as if she 'd been dropped down from 
her village." 

" Yes, that 's true," considered his wife. " But 
it 's hard, with Lydia's air and style and self-posses- 
sion, to realize that she is merely a village girl." 

a She may be much more impressed than she 
chooses to show," Mr. Erwin continued. " I re- 



 

member a very curious essay by a French writer 
about your countrymen : he contended that they 
were characterized by a savage stoicism through 
their contact with the Indians." 

" Nonsense, Henshaw ! There hasn 't been an 
Indian near South Bradfield for two hundred years. 
And besides that, am I stoical ? " 

"I'm bound to say," replied her husband, "that 
so far as you go, you 're a complete refutation of the 
theory." 

" I hate to see a young girl so close," fretted 
Mrs. Erwin. " Rut perhaps," she added, more 
cheerfully, " she 'll be the easier managed, being so 
passive. She doesn't seem at all willful, — that's 
one comfort." 

She went to Lydia's room just before dinner, and 
found the girl with her head fallen on her arms 
upon the table, where she had been writing. She 
looked up, and faced her aunt with swollen eyes. 

" Why, poor thing ! " cried Mrs. Erwin. " What 
is it, dear ? What is it, Lydia ? " she asked, ten- 
derly, and she pulled Lydia's face down upon her 
neck. 

" Oh, nothing," said Lydia. "I suppose I was a 
little homesick ; writing home made me." 

She somewhat coldly suffered Mrs. Erwin to kiss 
her and smooth her hair, while she began to talk 
with her of her grandfather and her aunt at home. 
" But this is going to be home to you now," said 
Mrs. Erwin, " and I 'm not going to let you be sick 



 

for any other. I want you to treat me just like a 
mother, or an older sister. Perhaps I shan't be the 
wisest mother to you in the world, but I mean to 
be one of the best. Come, now, bathe your eyes, 
my dear, and let 's go to dinner. I don't like to 
keep your uncle waiting." She did not go at once, 
but showed Lyclia the appointments of the room, 
and lightly indicated what she had caused to be 
done, and what she had done with her own hands, 
to make the place pretty for her. " And now shall 
I take your letter, and have your uncle post it this 
evening ? " She picked up the letter from the table. 
" Hadn 't you any wax to seal it ? You know 
they don't generally mucilage their envelopes in Eu- 
rope." 

Lydia blushed. " I left it open for you to read. 
I thought you ought to know what I wrote." 

Mrs. Erwin dropped her hands in front of her, 
with the open letter stretched between them, and 
looked at her niece in rapture. " Lydia," she 
cried, " one would suppose you had lived all your 
days in Europe ! Showing me your letter, this 
way, — why, it 's quite like a Continental girl." 

" I thought it was no more than right you should 
see what I was writing home," said Lydia, unre- 
sponsively. 

" Well, no matter, even if it ivas right," replied 
Mrs. Erwin. " It comes to the same thing. And 
now, as you 've been quite a European daughter, 
I 'm going to be a real American mother." She 



 

took up the wax, and sealed Lydia's letter without
