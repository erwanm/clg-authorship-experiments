take in all she could, to make all the advance 
possible, for she was proud of her standing, 
she sometimes grew quite weary, and the 
thought that this was her last year would in- 


 

trude. Never had girls seemed so charming 
to her, or the faculty so delightful. And it 
was hard to refuse joining different organiza- 
tions. 

“If you’ll only come in, we won't ask you 
to do much of anything,’ they pleaded. 

Out-of-doors was exhilarating. After all, 
few of the seniors stood on their dignity; in 
the games and sports they were not a day 
over sixteen. 

One of the juniors said, “ Why, I do not 
feel as old as when I was a freshman! And 
I was afraid I should be almost superannuated 
when I was through; twenty-two looked old 
to me. And now I think I shall be just in the 
most charming dawn of womanhood.” 

“ That is the way to look at it,” rejoined 
Professor Jordan, who stood among a bevy 
of girls. “ You are not to allow yourselves to 
get old. Think how many splendid women 
there are who are doing the world’s work and 
have passed the half-century. They have 
bright eyes, and eager, smiling faces, and 
are up-to-date in everything.” 

Miss Carol Saybrook had worked her way 




to the senior class and was considered a rather 
fascinating girl. She did dress elegantly, had 
a bright sort of wit, and a pathetic side that 
she allowed to crop out now and then, but 
drew it back again with the brief explanation 
that every one had trouble of some kind and 
did not want to be bored with that of other 
people. Her sigh would end with a beguiling 
smile. 

Her father had married a second time, and 
she was not on good terms with her step- 
mother. There were two younger children, 
“ and there may be a great houseful,” rather 
indignantly. “ Father is not a rich man, 
either, and if he should die we should all be 
beggars, I suppose.” 

She did not appear in any great straits now. 

Helen had experienced a rather curious in- 
terest in her, and of late they had taken some 
walks together, just by accident, it seemed. 

“ I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” 
Lorraine exclaimed complainingly, as she 
came up the walk only a few moments before 
dinner hour. “ I went to your room, Miss 
Morse’s, and the library, and out on the tennis 


 

court. They were having’ a fine game. And 
two days ago you disappeared mysteriously. 
If you were a soph, I should say you had been 
given a bad afternoon with a mountain of 
shortcomings.’ ’ 

“ I was walking.” 

“What sent you off alone?” 

Helen laughed, but just then the dinner bell 
pealed out its summons, and she ran. Lor- 
raine was the least bit jealous, not tiresomely 
so, and Leslie Brooks was very dear to her. 
She had also taken a great fancy to Miss 
Chardavoyne, but somehow she did not alto- 
gether like Miss Saybrook. She accepted 
Leslie's estimate of her. 

“ Leslie isn’t quite fair to her, I think,” 
Helen mused. “ She is curious, and though 
many of her epigrams are second-hand, they 
are always pat. And it must be hard to be 
crowded out of her father’s affection.” 

And not long after, Helen found herself 
straying off again with Miss Saybrook with- 
out the least design on her own part. 

“ I don't know just why you win one to a 
confidential mood," Miss Saybrook said. 




“ You are so different from the average girl. 
I do hope you will be very happy, Miss Grant, 
and yet I always fear for these large-hearted, 
generous, sympathetic girls. Commonplace 
people get more out of life, more out of their 
friends, and suffer less. You see, misfortunes 
never rest very heavily on them; they know 
how to shift them off on others. But when 
you keep sorrows to yourself — oh, I don't 
want to bore you — ” 

Her tone fell to pathos, her beautiful eyes 
were limpid and had the look of a hunted 
animal appealing for pity. They moved Helen 
in a sympathizing manner. 

“Oh, do not think of that! If you have 
any trouble — " Did she really want the con- 
fidence? How many other girls had it been 
given to, she wondered. 

“ I have a big question to decide. I'd like 
to know how it looks to some one with a little 
common sense. The ordinary girl is all for 
love, or the quality she thinks is love, and she 
scouts anything less in a marriage, but with 
a little experience she learns a great many 


 

things, and that one cannot live altogether 
on love.” 

“ No,” returned Helen seriously. She did 
not especially care about a dissertation on 
love. 

“No, you cannot live on love!” she said 
with a peculiar emphasis. “ It may be a defect 
in education,” with a touch of sarcasm. 
“ And I’m tired of being poor.” 

“ But it doesn’t seem to me that you are 
very poor.” 

“ Not up to this point, perhaps. Almost 
six years ago father married a young woman 
of twenty-three. He was just past forty. My 
mother left me some handsome jewels and a 
thousand dollars. My stepmother didn’t like 
me, wanted to get rid of me, in fact. Oh, 
there’s no love lost between us ! I said I 
would go to college, that would be all I would 
ask of him. Davenport is a wretched little 
place ; father has a big house, and hundreds 
of acres of land pretty well worn out, as 
Southern farms are. There is no society 
there. I like college life for the fun and vari- 
ety, the friends one makes. I’ve had a nice 



time every vacation, and my nice times, of 
course, end next summer. I should just hate 
to teach; I could not abide the confinement 
of office work, or waiting in a store.” 

She glanced up at Helen in an inquiring 
manner, as if testing her listener. 

“ I expect to teach,” Helen said with de- 
cision. Yet, she really could not imagine Miss 
Saybrook succeeding in that capacity. She 
was superficial; she would not get a diploma. 

“ Well — I just couldn’t, there now! I 
should want to shut myself in a room and turn 
on the gas. There’s no use in living unless 
you can have some of the things you want. 
I hate poverty and everything belonging to 
it. Father thinks he has done his duty by me; 
no doubt there’ll be a houseful of children to 
educate. He should have had more sense than 
to marry that way.” 

“ But what will you do? ” asked Helen with 
a puzzled air. She did not for an instant be- 
lieve Miss Saybrook would lay down life 
easily.
