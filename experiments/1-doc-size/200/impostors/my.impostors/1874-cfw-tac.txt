But I would not let him proceed; I felt for that woman down stairs as
though she had been a man and a brother, and I was determined to save
her from the rest. I threw my book and a great piece of rock over the
side of that perfidious old demi-lune, the startled Professor rushed up
the stairs, and there I was, innocently waking up, and regretting that
the wind had blown the new volume off the parapet. I took that man’s
arm, and I walked him home, and I never stopped talking one instant
until I had masked the retreat of the governess up stairs to her own
room; and then I went back to Hospital Street and told Sara.

“No doubt she is sitting there now, surrounded by her relics, the
vicious-looking roots, the shells, the lumps of coquina, the spiny
things, and the bone,” said Sara, laughing.

“Don’t laugh, Sara; it is too real. She liked that man.”

“So much the worse for her, then,” replied my companion. “She had better
tear out her heart and throw it to the dogs at once.”

When Sara answered me after that fashion, I generally let her alone.

“Aunt Diana is really going to-morrow,” I said, the next evening, as
John Hoffman and I stood leaning on the Plaza railing, waiting for the
mail.

“Yes; shall you go also?”

“No; we have decided to remain another week, Sara and I. But I am really
surprised; I thought Iris would carry the day; she was determined to
stay longer.”

“I think I can account for that,” said John, smiling. “We were walking
together last evening in the moonlight on the sea-wall, and, happening
to stroll into the demi-lune--”

“Oh, that demi-lune!”

“Yes, that demi-lune. There we found the Captain.”

“The Captain?”

“The Captain. But not alone. Miss Arabella--Miss Van Amsterdam was with
him!”

Now Miss Van Amsterdam was a beauty and an heiress.

The next morning we bade farewell to the departing half of our party.
“Do you think that impervious old Professor will try it again between
here and New York?” I said, as we strolled back from the little dépôt.

“I doubt it,” answered Sara. “He is the kind that goes in ankle deep,
and then hesitates over the final plunge. But probably all the rest of
his life he will cherish the delusion that he had only to speak, and he
will intimate as much to his cronies over a temperate and confidential
glass of whisky on winter nights.”

“After all, Miss Sharp is worth twenty Professors. How silently and even
smilingly she bore her fate! Iris, now, pouted openly over the Captain’s
desertion.”

“She will forget all about it before she is half way to Tocoi, and there
will be a new train of admirers behind her before the steamer enters the
Savannah harbor,” said Sara, smiling.

“Do you know who has been the real heroine of the romance of these last
weeks, Sara?”

“Who?”

“The demi-lune!”

Our one remaining week rolled its hours swiftly along. Every morning the
Sabre-boy began the day by ringing his great bell, beginning on the
ground-floor, then up the stairs, a salvo in our little entry-way, a
flurry around the corner, and a long excursion down the gallery, with a
salute to all outdoors on the rear balcony; then counter-march, ringing
all the time, back to the second-story stairs, up the stairway, and a
tremendous clanging at the three blue doors; then, face about, and over
the whole route again down to the ground-floor, where a final flourish
in jig time always brought the sleepy idea that he was dancing a
double-shuffle of triumph in conclusion.

“I don’t know which is the worst,” said Sara, “the dogs that
bark all night, the roosters that crow all day, the Sabre and
his morning clanging, or the cathedral chimes, those venerable and
much-written-about relics that ring in the hours like a fire-alarm of
cow-bells gone mad.”

“Do you know that to-morrow will be Easter?” I said, when we had but two
days left. “We must ask Mr. Hoffman to take us out this evening to hear
the Minorcans sing; to-morrow we will go to the Episcopal church, and
then, on Monday, ho! for the bonny North.”

“Very bonny!” said Sara.

“Do you agree to the programme, mademoiselle?”

“All save the church-going.”

“We are not Episcopalians, I know, but on Easter-Sunday--”

“Oh, it isn’t that, Martha. I don’t want to go to church at all. I am
not in the mood.”

“But, Sara, my dear--”

“Yes, and Sara, my dear! Religion is for two classes--the happy and the
resigned. I belong to neither. I am lost out of the first, and I haven’t
yet found the second. I took this journey to please you, Martha. I don’t
blame you; it was all chance; but--You think you know all my life. You
know nothing about it. Martha, I was once engaged to John Hoffman.”

“What! engaged?”

“Yes, for six short months. But it was ten years ago, and I was only
eighteen. He had forgotten both it and me, as I could see by his face
when you first introduced him on that New York steamer. I am only one of
a succession, I presume,” continued Sara, in a bitter tone. (I thought
it very likely, but did not say so.) “I was at home up in the mountains
then, and he came that way on a hunting expedition. It was the old, old
story, and I was so happy! I knew little and cared less about his social
position. I was educated, therefore I was his peer. But he was stern,
and I was proud; he was unyielding, and I rebellious; he wished to rule,
and I would obey no one, although I would have given him freely the
absolute devotion of every breath had he not demanded it. We parted,
still up in the mountains, where he had lingered for my sake, and I had
never seen him since that day until, when fairly out at sea, he appeared
on the deck of that steamer. He took the initiative immediately with his
calm politeness, and I was not to be outdone. I flatter myself that not
one of you suspected that we had ever met before. And now, Martha, not
one word, please. There is nothing to say. We shall soon be parted
again, very likely for another ten years, as he does not return North
with us. Do not fancy that I am unhappy about it. I am like Esther in
Bleak House, when, after that unwished-for and unpleasant offer of
marriage, she nevertheless found herself weeping as she had not done
since the days when she buried the dear old doll down in the garden. It
is only that the old chords are stirred, Martha dear; nothing more.”



When, late in the evening, John sent up word that he was waiting for us,
I hesitated; but Sara rose and said, “Come,” in her calm, every-day
manner, and I went.

“What will it be like, Mr. Hoffman?” I said, as soon as we reached the
street, in order to make talk.

“Principally singing,” he replied, “according to an old custom of the
Minorcans. On Easter-even the young men assemble with musical
instruments, and visit the houses of all their friends. Before they
begin singing they tap on the shutter, and if they are welcome there is
an answering tap within. Then follows the long hymn they call
Fromajardis, always the same seven verses, with a chorus after each
verse, all in the Minorcan dialect. Next comes a recitative soliciting
the customary gifts, a bag is held under the window, and the people of
the house open the shutter, and drop into it eggs, cheese, cakes, and
other dainties, while the young men acknowledge their bounty with a
song, and then depart.”

We followed the singers for an hour, listening to the ancient song,
which sounded sweetly through the narrow streets in the midnight
stillness. My two companions talked on as usual, but I could not. I was
haunted by that picture of ten years ago.

Easter-Sunday morning I went to church alone; Sara would not go with me.
John Hoffman sat near me. I mentioned it when I returned home.

“I hate such religion as his,” said Sara. She was lying on the couch,
with her defiant eyes fixed on the blank wall opposite.

“Dear child,” I said, “do not speak in that tone. It is ten years since
you knew him, and indeed I do think he is quite earnest and sincere. No
doubt he has changed--”

“He has not changed,” interrupted Sara; “he is the same cold, hard,
proud--”

Her voice ceased, and looking up, I saw that she had turned her face to
the wall, and was silently weeping.

In the evening I begged her to come with me to the Sunday-school
festival. “It will do you good to see the children, and hear them sing,”
I said.

She went passively; she had regained her composure, and moved about,
pale and calm.

The church stood on the Plaza; it was small, but beautiful and complete,
with chancel and memorial windows of stained glass. Flowers adorned it,
intertwined with the soft cloudy gray moss, a profusion of blossoms
which could not be equaled in any Northern church, because of its very
carelessness. Not the least impressive incident, at least to Northern
eyes, was the fact that the ranks of the children singing, “Onward,
Christian soldiers,” were headed by an officer in the United States
uniform, the colonel commanding the post, who was also the
superintendent of the Sunday-school. And when, in reading his report,
the superintendent bowed his head in acknowledgment of the rector’s
cordial aid and sympathy, those who knew that the rector had been
himself a soldier all through those four long years, and fighting, too,
on the other side, felt their hearts stirred within them to see the two
