him at all. 

" What do you suppose became of your letters? " 
she asked when he had done. For Pitt had not 
said that they went to his father's hands. 

" I suppose they shared the fate of all letters 
uncalled-for; if not the dead-letter office, the 
fire." 

" It was not very strange that you could not find 
us when you came to New York. We really 
troubled the post office very little, having after a 
while nothing to expect from it; and that was the 
only place where you could hope to get a clue." 
Neither would Esther mention Mr. Dallas. With 
a woman's curious fine discernment she had ween 



 

that all was not right in that quarter; indeed had 
suspected it long ago. 

" But you got some letters from me ? " Pitt went 
on, " while you were in Seaforth. One or two, I 
know." 

"Yes, several. yes! while we were in Seaforth." 

"And I got answers. Do you remember one 
long letter you wrote me ? the second year after 
I went?" 

" Yes," she said without looking at him. 

"Esther, that letter was worth everything to 
me. It was like a sunbeam coming out between 
misty clouds and shewing things for a moment in 
their true colours. I never forgot it. I never could 
forget it, though I fought for some years with the 
truth it revealed to me. I believed what you told 
me, and so I knew what I ought to do; but I struggled against my convictions. I knew from that 
time, that it was the happiest thing and the worth 
iest thing, to be a saint; all the same, I wanted to 
be a sinner. I wanted to follow my own way and 
be my own master. I wanted to distinguish my 
self in my profession, and rise in the world, and 
tower over other men ; and I liked all the delights 
of life, as well as other people do, and was unwill 
ing to give up a life of self-indulgence, which I 
had means to gratify. Esther, I fought hard ! I 
fought for years, can you believe it? before 
I could make up my mind." 

"And now? " she said, looking at him. 

"Now? Now," said he lowering his voice a 





little, u now I have come to know the truth of what 
you told me; I have learned to know Christ; and I 
know, as you know, that all things that may be 
desired are not to be compared with that knowledge. 
I understand what Paul meant when he said he had 
suffered the loss of all things for it and counted 
them less than nothing. So do I; so would I; so 
have I, as far as the giving up of myself and them 
to their right owner goes. That is done." 

Esther was very glad; she knew she ought to be 
very glad, and she was; and yet, gladness was not 
precisely the uppermost feeling that possessed her. 
She did not know what in the world could make 
her think of tears at that moment; but there was a 
strange sensation as if, had she been alone, she 
would have liked to cry. No shadow of such a 
softness appeared, however. 

"What decided you at last?" she said softly. 
" I can scarce tell you," he answered. " I was 
busy studying the matter, arguing for and against ; 
and then I saw of a sudden that I was lighting a 
lost battle; that my sense and reason and conscience 
were all gained over, and only my will held out. 
Then I gave up fighting any more." 

" You came up to the subject on a different side 
from what I did," Esther remarked. 

"And you, Esther? have you been always as 
happy as you were when you wrote that letter?" 
" Yes," she said quietly. "More happy." But 
she did not look up. 

" The happiness in your letter was the sunbeam 



 

that cleared up everything for me. Now I have 
talked enough ; tell me of yourself and your father." 
"There is not much to tell," said Esther with 
that odd quietness. She felt somehow oppressed. 
"We are living in the old fashion; have been living so, all along." 

" But- Quite in the old fashion ? " he said with a 
swift glance at the little room where they were sit 
ting. " It does not look so, Esther." 

" This is not so pleasant a place as we were in 
when we first came to New York," Esther confessed. " That was very pleasant." 
" Why did you change V " 

" It was necessary," she said with a smile. " 
you may as well know it; papa lost money." 
" How ? " 

"He invested the money from the sale of the  
place at Seaforth, in some stocks that gave out 
somehow. He lost it all. So then we had nothing 
but the stipend from England; and I think papa 
somehow lost part of that, or was obliged to take 
part of it to meet obligations." 
" And you? " 

" We did very well," said Esther with another 
smile. " We are doing very well now. We are 
out of debt, and that is everything. And I think 
papa is pretty comfortable." 
"And Esther?" 
" Esther is happy." 

" But I should think, forgive me ! that this bit 
of a house would hardly hold you." 





"See how mistaken you are! We have two 
rooms unused." 

Pitt's eye roved somewhat restlessly over the one 
in which they were, as he remarked, 

" I never comprehended just why you went away 
from Seaforth." 

" For my education, I believe." 

" You were getting a very good education when 
I was there ! " 

" When you were there," repeated Esther smiling ; 
but then she went on quickly, " Papa thought he 
could not give me all the advantages he wished, 
if we staid in Seaforth. So we came to New York. 
And now, you see, I am able to provide for him. 
The education is turning to account." 

" How ? " asked Pitt suddenly. 

" I help out his small income by giving lessons." 

"You, giving lessons? Not that, Esther ! " 

"Why not?" she said quietly. "The thing 
given one to do. is the thing to do, you know; 
and this certainly was given me. And by means 
of that we get along nicely." 

Again Pitt's eye glanced over the scanty little 
apartment. What sort of " getting along " was it 
which kept them here ? 

" What do you teach ? " he asked, speaking out 
of a confusion of thoughts the one thing that 
occurred which it was safe to say. 

"Drawing, and music, and some English 
branches." 

"Do you eit?" 



 

She hesitated. " I am very thankful to have it 
to do. I do not fancy that teaching for money is 
just the same as teaching for pleasure. But I am 
very glad to be able to do it. Before that, there 
was a time when I did not know just what was 
going to become of us. Now I am very happy."
