You know that in your heart you would not quite believe me, if I 
spoke, and that you would always fancy I had some object in 
view, until all were accomplished. Even then you might never 
forget the disagreeable association between my personality and 
your calamities. I prefer to remain where I am in your estimation. 
Besides, why should I cause you all the -pain of anticipation, when 
it can do no good ? After all, nobody is infallible. What if I had 
made a mistake in my calculations ? ' 

' That is true,' answered Greif, though his tone showed some 
doubt. Although he really did not believe that calculation or 
mathematics of any sort had anything to do with Rex's seeming 
knowledge of future events, the possibility of a mistake seemed 
small indeed, when Rex himself suggested it. 

'I knew you would not insist,' said Rex. 'Indeed it is much 
better to watch those two fellows drumming on each other's heads, 
and to drink our early draught in peace without speculating about 
the future. Look at them ! It is nearly a quarter of an hour, 
and not a scratch yet, though they hit each other with every 
tierce, flat as a soup-plate falling upon a millpond. But it is a 
pretty sight.' 

Greif did not answer. The gladiatorial show had lost its 
charms for him and his mind brooded gloomily over coming 
events. The sun was not up, though it was broad dawn when he 
and his companions went out into the cool, silent streets, realising 
when they breathed the morning air the closeness of the heated 
atmosphere they had quitted. They separated by degrees, dropping 
off, one after the other, as each approached his lodgings, but before 
going home they all accompanied Rex to the street door of his 
dwelling. 

When Greif was alone he threw open his window to the fresh 
morning breeze, and sitting down as he was, drank in the air, 
which to him seemed so delightfully sweet, though it would have 
chilled a weaker man to the bone. It was all the refreshment he 
needed, in spite of a sleepless night, spent chiefly in an atmosphere 



 

heated by gas and heavy with the fumes of tobacco. The morning, 
too, was exceptionally clear and beautiful. A scarcely perceptible 
mist blended the neutral tints of the old town with the faint 
colours of the sky, which changed by gentle degrees from dark 
blue to violet, from violet to palest green, then to yellow and 
then at last to the living blue of day above, while a vast fan 
of golden light trembled above the spot whence the sun would 
presently rise. The level rays gilded the slender cathedral spire, 
and the glass of many a pointed gable-window in the town sent 
back the flaming reflexion. All above was warm, and all below 
was cold in the blue shadow that still darkened the flowing river 
and the narrow streets beyond. 

For a time Greif gave himself up to the pleasure of the sight 
and sensation. His instinctive love of nature was strong enough 
to absorb his whole being at certain moments, for it was real, 
and not cultivated, thorough and altogether unconscious of itself. 
But when the exceptional loveliness of the dawn and sunrise was 
drowned in the flooding light of an ordinarily fine day, Greif rose 
from his seat by the window and went about the business of 
dressing regretfully, as though he wished that the morning might 
sink back again into the twilight, as quickly as in the far north, 
when the sun first shows the edge of his disc above the horizon in 
early spring. 

He had no thought of taking any rest, and intended to go to 
the University as usual, for it was a part of his Teutonic character 
to take his amusement at the expense of his sleep rather than to 
the detriment of his work. After such a night an Italian would 
have gone to bed, a Frenchman would have swallowed a brimming 
glass of absinthe and would have passed the day in visiting his 
fellow-students, or fellow-artists, an Englishman would have taken 
a plunge in the icy river and would have gone for a walk in the 
country. But Greif did none of these things. He drank his 
coffee and went to his books and his lectures as though nothing 
unusual had happened. He did it mechanically and felt himself 
obliged to do it, as much as any guard -officer in Berlin, who 
comes home from a ball at dawn, exchanges the inadmissible kid 
gloves and varnished boots he wears in society for the regulation 
articles of leather, smooths his hair with the little brushes he 
always has in his pocket, draws his sword and marches out with 
his company of grenadiers to the exercising ground, as merrily and 
as naturally as though he had spent the night in bed. 

Before he left the house again, Greif received a letter from 
his father. It was some time since the latter had mentioned 



 

Rieseneck and Greif did not now expect any news concerning him. 
He turned pale as he read the contents. It appeared that 
Rieseneck had landed in Europe and intended to proceed without 
delay to Berlin, in order to report himself at the Home Office as 
one who desired to take advantage of the amnesty with the 
intention of residing in his native country. 

' I myself,' wrote Greifenstein, ' have serious doubts in this 
matter. I cannot believe that your uncle is included in the 
general pardon for political offenders. He committed a crime 
against both civil and military law and was condemned by a 
court-martial. It would have been more respectable to shoot him 
at once. As this was not done, I have actually been obliged to 
write to him, now, warning him that in my opinion he is not safe. 
In the meanwhile, be careful, my dear boy, and keep amongst 
your own Korps, where you are not likely to have trouble about 
your infamous relation. He is not worth fighting for, though you 
would of course be obliged to go out if a stranger made disagree- 
able remarks. Happily, in a little more than a month, you will 
be at home, where such things cannot occur. Praise be to Heaven, 
we are very well, though your mother continues to be more silent 
than usual. Hexerl has got over the distemper very well and is a 
fine pup. I have decided not to fell the old wood, though it is 
quite time. What need have I for the money ? Let the trees 
stand till the wind blows them down. Perhaps you will be glad, 
though you do not often go to that part of the forest. I have 
sent your rifle to Stuttgardt to be re -sigh ted as you wished. 
And so, good-bye. 5 

Greif put the letter into his pocket and went gloomily on his 
way to the lecture, reflecting that at that very moment Rieseneck 
was probably on his way to Berlin. 



CHAPTER X 

THE snow fell heavily in the Black Forest during the third week 
of December. It lay in great white drifts against the huge 
rampart of Greifenstein, blown against the rough masonry by 
the bitter north wind, until the approach to the main gate was a 
deep trench dug in the white covering of the earth. The driving 
blast had driven great patches of flakes against the lofty wall so 
that they stuck to the stones and looked like broad splashes of 
white paint. The north sides of the pointed roofs on the towers 
were white, too, and gleamed in the occasional bursts of sunshine 
that interrupted the fierce weather. In the forest, the slanting 
branches of the firs were loaded down with irregular masses of 
snow, through which the needle foliage looked as black as ink. 
Not a spot of colour was visible anywhere, for everything was 
either black or white. 

Old Greifenstein was no more afraid of the weather than he 
was of anything else. Day after day he went out with his gun 
and his dog, to fight his way for miles through the drifts, 
up and down hill, over the open moor where the snow was not 
knee-deep, under the giant trees from which great lumps of it 
fell now and then upon his fur cap and grizzled hair, down into 
the dells and gorges where it was nearly up to his neck, and 
where his sturdy dog struggled wildly through the passage his 
master had made. Greifenstein pursued the only amusement of 
his life in his own solitary fashion, rarely shooting at anything, 
never missing when he did, killing a buck once or twice in a week 
and bringing it home on his own shoulders for the use of his 
household, or lying in wait for six or seven hours at a time to 
get a shot at a stag ; grimly pleased to be always alone, and silently 
satisfied in the thought that all was his, and his only, to kill or 
to let live at his seigneurial discretion. The keepers knew that he 
wanted no companions, and they kept out of his way when he 


 

was abroad, not dissatisfied perhaps that their tireless master 
should do most of their work in the bitter weather, leaving them to 
smoke their pipes in their cottages or to drink their beer and 
cherry spirits in the inn of the distant village. He left the house 
in the morning and rarely returned before dusk. It is not strange 
that his humour should have grown more stern and melancholy 
under such circumstances. 

Greifenstein and his wife seemed to understand each other, 
however, and though days passed during which they scarcely 
exchanged a word, neither complained of the other's silence nor 
felt the slightest desire to do so. From time to time one of the 
servants declared that he could bear the life no longer, and gave 
up his large wages and gorgeous apparel to return to the city. 
He was replaced by another, without any remark. Contrary to 
German custom, Greifenstein never expected any one to stay long 
in the house, and merely stipulated that any one who wished to 
leave should give warning a fortnight previously. Neither he nor 
his wife were yet so old as to tempt servants to stay on for the 
death, in the hope of picking up something worth having in the 
general confusion. There was something strange in the way the 
pair lived, lonely and unloved in their ancient home, amidst a 
crowd of ever-changing attendants, who succumbed one by one to 
the awful dreariness of the isolated life, and went away to give 
place to others, who, in their turn would give it up after six 
months or a year. And yet neither Greifenstein nor Clara would 
have changed their existence. 

Greifenstein had abandoned the attempt to explain his wife's 
illness, if she were really ill, but he could not help seeing the 
alteration that was going on for the worse in her appearance and 
character, and the sight did not contribute to his peace. He him- 
self looked much the same as ever. After receiving the news that
