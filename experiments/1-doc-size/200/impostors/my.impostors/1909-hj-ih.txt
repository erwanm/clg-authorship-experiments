of such a consummate thing is its great secret as well as its great
merit--a taste which seems one of the lost instincts of mankind. Go and
enjoy this supreme expression of Vandyck’s fine sense, and admit that
never was a politer production.

Milan speaks to us of a burden of felt life of which Turin is innocent,
but in its general aspect still lingers a northern reserve which makes
the place rather perhaps the last of the prose capitals than the first
of the poetic. The long Austrian occupation perhaps did something
to Germanise its physiognomy; though indeed this is an indifferent
explanation when one remembers how well, temperamentally speaking, Italy
held her own in Venetia. Milan, at any rate, if not bristling with the
æsthetic impulse, opens to us frankly enough the thick volume of her
past. Of that volume the Cathedral is the fairest and fullest page--a
structure not supremely interesting, not logical, not even, to some
minds, commandingly beautiful, but grandly curious and superbly rich. I
hope, for my own part, never to grow too particular to admire it. If
it had no other distinction it would still have that of impressive,
immeasurable achievement. As I strolled beside its vast indented base
one evening, and felt it, above me, rear its grey mysteries into the
starlight while the restless human tide on which I floated rose no
higher than the first few layers of street-soiled marble, I was tempted
to believe that beauty in great architecture is almost a secondary
merit, and that the main point is mass--such mass as may make it a
supreme embodiment of vigorous effort. Viewed in this way a great
building is the greatest conceivable work of art. More than any other
it represents difficulties mastered, resources combined, labour, courage
and patience. And there are people who tell us that art has nothing to
do with morality! Little enough, doubtless, when it is concerned,
even ever so little, in painting the roof of Milan Cathedral within
to represent carved stone-work. Of this famous roof every one has
heard--how good it is, how bad, how perfect a delusion, how transparent
an artifice. It is the first thing your cicerone shows you on entering
the church. The occasionally accommodating art-lover may accept it
philosophically, I think; for the interior, though admirably effective
as a whole, has no great sublimity, nor even purity, of pitch. It
is splendidly vast and dim; the altarlamps twinkle afar through the
incense-thickened air like foglights at sea, and the great columns rise
straight to the roof, which hardly curves to meet them, with the girth
and altitude of oaks of a thousand years; but there is little refinement
of design--few of those felicities of proportion which the eye caresses,
when it finds them, very much as the memory retains and repeats some
happy lines of poetry or some haunting musical phrase. Consistently
brave, none the less, is the result produced, and nothing braver than a
certain exhibition that I privately enjoyed of the relics of St.
Charles Borromeus. This holy man lies at his eternal rest in a small but
gorgeous sepulchral chapel, beneath the boundless pavement and before
the high altar; and for the modest sum of five francs you may have his
shrivelled mortality unveiled and gaze at it with whatever reserves
occur to you. The Catholic Church never renounces a chance of the
sublime for fear of a chance of the ridiculous--especially when the
chance of the sublime may be the very excellent chance of five francs.
The performance in question, of which the good San Carlo paid in the
first instance the cost, was impressive certainly, but as a monstrous
matter or a grim comedy may still be. The little sacristan, having
secured his audience, whipped on a white tunic over his frock, lighted a
couple of extra candles and proceeded to remove from above the altar,
by means of a crank, a sort of sliding shutter, just as you may see
a shop-boy do of a morning at his master’s window. In this case too a
large sheet of plate-glass was uncovered, and to form an idea of the
étalage you must imagine that a jeweller, for reasons of his own, has
struck an unnatural partnership with an undertaker. The black mummified
corpse of the saint is stretched out in a glass coffin, clad in his
mouldering canonicals, mitred, crosiered and gloved, glittering with
votive jewels. It is an extraordinary mixture of death and life; the
desiccated clay, the ashen rags, the hideous little black mask and
skull, and the living, glowing, twinkling splendour of diamonds,
emeralds and sapphires. The collection is really fine, and many great
historic names are attached to the different offerings. Whatever may be
the better opinion as to the future of the Church, I can’t help thinking
she will make a figure in the world so long as she retains this
great fund of precious “properties,” this prodigious capital
decoratively invested and scintillating throughout Christendom at
effectively-scattered points. You see I am forced to agree after all, in
spite of the sliding shutter and the profane swagger of the sacristan,
that a certain pastoral majesty saved the situation, or at least made
irony gape. Yet it was from a natural desire to breathe a sweeter air
that I immediately afterwards undertook the interminable climb to the
roof of the cathedral. This is another world of wonders, and one which
enjoys due renown, every square inch of wall on the winding stairways
being bescribbled with a traveller’s name. There is a great glare from
the far-stretching slopes of marble, a confusion (like the masts of a
navy or the spears of an army) of image-capped pinnacles, biting the
impalpable blue, and, better than either, the goodliest view of level
Lombardy sleeping in its rich transalpine light and resembling, with its
white-walled dwellings and the spires on its horizon, a vast green sea
spotted with ships. After two months of Switzerland the Lombard plain is
a rich rest to the eye, and the yellow, liquid, free-flowing light--as
if on favoured Italy the vessels of heaven were more widely opened--had
for mine a charm which made me think of a great opaque mountain as a
blasphemous invasion of the atmospheric spaces.

I have mentioned the cathedral first, but the prime treasure of Milan at
the present hour is the beautiful, tragical Leonardo. The cathedral is
good for another thousand years, but we ask whether our children will
find in the most majestic and most luckless of frescoes much more than
the shadow of a shadow. Its fame has been for a century or two that, as
one may say, of an illustrious invalid whom people visit to see how
he lasts, with leave-taking sighs and almost death-bed or tiptoe
precautions. The picture needs not another scar or stain, now, to be the
saddest work of art in the world; and battered, defaced, ruined as it
is, it remains one of the greatest. We may really compare its anguish
of decay to the slow conscious ebb of life in a human organism. The
production of the prodigy was a breath from the infinite, and the
painter’s conception not immeasurably less complex than the scheme, say,
of his own mortal constitution. There has been much talk lately of the
irony of fate, but I suspect fate was never more ironical than when she
led the most scientific, the most calculating of all painters to spend
fifteen long years in building his goodly house upon the sand. And yet,
after all, may not the playing of that trick represent but a deeper
wisdom, since if the thing enjoyed the immortal health and bloom of a
first-rate Titian we should have lost one of the most pertinent lessons
in the history of art? We know it as hearsay, but here is the plain
proof, that there is no limit to the amount of “stuff” an artist may put
into his work. Every painter ought once in his life to stand before the
Cenacolo and decipher its moral. Mix with your colours and mess on your
palette every particle of the very substance of your soul, and this lest
perchance your “prepared surface” shall play you a trick! Then, and then
only, it will fight to the last--it will resist even in death. Raphael
was a happier genius; you look at his lovely “Marriage of the Virgin” at
the Brera, beautiful as some first deep smile of conscious inspiration,
but to feel that he foresaw no complaint against fate, and that he knew
the world he wanted to know and charmed it into never giving him away.
But I have left no space to speak of the Brera, nor of that paradise
of book-worms with an eye for their background--if such creatures
exist--the Ambrosian Library; nor of that mighty basilica of St.
Ambrose, with its spacious atrium and its crudely solemn mosaics, in
which it is surely your own fault if you don’t forget Dr. Strauss and M.
Renan and worship as grimly as a Christian of the ninth century.

It is part of the sordid prose of the Mont Cenis road that, unlike those
fine old unimproved passes, the Simplon, the Splügen and--yet awhile
longer--the Saint-Gothard, it denies you a glimpse of that paradise
adorned by the four lakes even as that of uncommented Scripture by
the rivers of Eden. I made, however, an excursion to the Lake of Como,
which, though brief, lasted long enough to suggest to me that I too was
a hero of romance with leisure for a love-affair, and not a hurrying
tourist with a Bradshaw in his pocket. The Lake of Como has figured
largely in novels of “immoral” tendency--being commonly the spot to
which inflamed young gentlemen invite the wives of other gentlemen to
fly with them and ignore the restrictions of public opinion. But even
the Lake of Como has been revised and improved; the fondest prejudices
yield to time; it gives one somehow a sense of an aspiringly high tone.
I should pay a poor compliment at least to the swarming inmates of the
hotels which now alternate attractively by the water-side with villas
old and new were I to read the appearances more cynically. But if it is
lost to florid fiction it still presents its blue bosom to most other
refined uses, and the unsophisticated tourist, the American at least,
may do any amount of private romancing there. The pretty hotel at
Cadenabbia offers him, for instance, in the most elegant and assured
form, the so often precarious adventure of what he calls at home summer
board. It is all so unreal, so fictitious, so elegant and idle, so
framed to undermine a rigid sense of the chief end of man not being to
float for ever in an ornamental boat, beneath an awning tasselled like
a circus-horse, impelled by an affable Giovanni or Antonio from one
stately stretch of lake-laved villa steps to another, that departure
seems as harsh and unnatural as the dream-dispelling note of some
punctual voice at your bedside on a dusky winter morning. Yet I
wondered, for my own part, where I had seen it all before--the
pink-walled villas gleaming through their shrubberies of orange and
oleander, the mountains shimmering in the hazy light like so many
breasts of doves, the constant presence of the melodious Italian voice.
Where indeed but at the Opera when the manager has been more than
usually regardless of expense? Here in the foreground was the palace of
the nefarious barytone, with its banqueting-hall opening as freely on
the stage as a railway buffet on the platform; beyond, the delightful
back scene, with its operatic gamut of colouring; in the middle the
scarlet-sashed barcaiuoli, grouped like a chorus, hat in hand,
awaiting the conductor’s signal. It was better even than being in a
novel--this being, this fairly wallowing, in a libretto.





THE OLD SAINT-GOTHARD LEAVES FROM A NOTE-BOOK


Berne, September, 1873.--In Berne again, some eleven weeks after
having left it in July. I have never been in Switzerland so late, and
I came hither innocently supposing the last Cook’s tourist to have paid
out his last coupon and departed. But I was lucky, it seems, to discover
an empty cot in an attic and a very tight place at a table d’hôte.
People are all flocking out of Switzerland, as in July they were
flocking in, and the main channels of egress are terribly choked. I
have been here several days, watching them come and go; it is like
the march-past of an army. It gives one, for an occasional change
from darker thoughts, a lively impression of the numbers of people now
living, and above all now moving, at extreme ease in the world. Here
is little Switzerland disgorging its tens of thousands of honest folk,
chiefly English, and rarely, to judge by their faces and talk, children
of light in any eminent degree; for whom snow-peaks and glaciers
and passes and lakes and chalets and sunsets and a café complet,
“including honey,” as the coupon says, have become prime necessities
for six weeks every year. It’s not so long ago that lords and
nabobs monopolised these pleasures; but nowadays in a month’s tour in
Switzerland is no more a jeu de prince than a Sunday excursion. To
watch this huge Anglo-Saxon wave ebbing through Berne suggests, no doubt
