man or woman tries three times to find happiness in love, and fails each
time, we have a right to assume that the fault must lie with that
person, and not with the three partners.

I think we may go further yet; having made wise laws of love and
marriage, taking into consideration all human needs, we have a right to
require that men and women shall obey the laws. At present the great
mass of the public has sympathy for the law-breaker; just as, in old
days, the peasants could not help admiring the outlaw who resisted
unjust land laws and robbed the rich, or as today, under the capitalist
régime, we can not withhold our sympathy from political prisoners, even
though they have committed acts of violence which we deplore. But when
we have made sex laws that we know are just and sensible--then we shall
consider that we have the right to restrain sex criminals, and in
extreme cases we shall avail ourselves of the skill of science to
perform a surgical operation which will render him unable in future to
prey upon the love needs of people who are placed at his mercy by their
best qualities, their unselfishness and lack of suspicion.

We clear out foul-smelling weeds from our garden, because we wish to
raise beautiful flowers and useful herbs therein. There lives in
California a student of plant life, who has shown us what we can do, not
by magic or by superhuman efforts, but simply by loving plants, by
watching them ceaselessly, understanding their ways, and guiding their
sex-life to our own purposes. We can perform what to our ignorant
ancestors would have seemed to be miracles; we can actually make all
sorts of new plants, which will continue to breed their own kind, and
survive forever if we give them proper care. In other words, Luther
Burbank has shown us that we can "change plant nature."

There flash back upon my memory all those dull, weary, sick human
creatures, who have repeated to me that dull, weary, sick old formula,
"You cannot change human nature." I do not think I am indulging either
in religious superstition or in blind optimism, but am speaking
precisely, in saying that whenever human beings get ready to apply
experimental science to themselves, they can change human nature just as
they now change plant nature. By putting human bodies together in love,
we make new bodies of children more beautiful than any who have yet
romped on the earth; and in the same way, by putting minds and souls
together, we can make new kinds of minds and souls, different from those
we have previously known, and greater than either the man-soul or the
woman-soul alone.

Also, by that magic which is the law of mind and soul life, each new
creation can be multiplied to infinity, and shared by all other minds
and souls that live in the present or may live in the future. We have
shown elsewhere how genius multiplies to infinity the joy and power of
life by means of the arts; and one of the greatest of the arts is the
art of love. Consider the great lovers, the true lovers, of history--how
they have enriched the lives of us all. It does not make any difference
whether these men and women lived in the flesh, or in the brain of a
poet--we learn alike from Dante and Beatrice, from Abélard and Héloïse,
from Robert and Elizabeth Browning, from Tristan and Isolde, from Romeo
and Juliet, what is the depth and the splendor of this passion which
lies hidden within us, and how it may enrich and vivify and glorify all
life.




PART FOUR

THE BOOK OF SOCIETY




CHAPTER XLVIII

THE EGO AND THE WORLD

     (Discusses the beginning of consciousness, in the infant and in
     primitive man, and the problem of its adjustment to life.)


We have now to consider the relationship of man to his fellows, with
whom he lives in social groups. Upon this problem floods of light have
been thrown by the new science of psycho-analysis. I will try to give,
briefly and in simple language, an idea of these discoveries.

One of the laws of biology is that every individual, in his development,
reproduces the history of the race; so that impulses and mental states
of a child reveal to us what our far-off ancestors loved and feared. The
same thing is discovered to be true of neurotics, people who have failed
in adjusting themselves to civilized life, and have gone back, in some
or all of their mental traits, to infantile states. If we analyze the
unconscious minds of "nervous patients," and compare them with what we
find in the minds of infants, and in savages, we discover the same
dreams, the same longings and the same fears.

The mental life of man begins in the womb. We cannot observe that life
directly, but we know that it is there, because there cannot be organic
life without mind to direct it, and just as there is an unconscious mind
that regulates the bodily processes in adults, so in the embryo there
must be an unconscious mind to direct the flow of blood, the building of
bones, muscle, eyes and brain. The mental life of that unborn creature
is of course purely egotistical; it knows nothing outside itself, and it
finds this universe an agreeable place--everything being supplied to it,
promptly and perfectly, without effort of its own.

But suddenly it gets its first shock; pain begins, and severe
discomfort, and the creature is shoved out into a cold world, yelling in
protest against the unsought change. And from that moment on, the
new-born infant labors to adjust itself to an entirely new set of
conditions. Discomforts trouble it, and it cries. Quickly it learns that
these cries are answered, and satisfaction of its needs is furnished.
Somehow, magically, things appear; warm and dry covering, a trickle of
delicious hot milk into its mouth. At first the infant mind has no idea
how all this happens; but gradually it comes to realize objects outside
itself, and it forms the idea that these objects exist to serve its
wants. Later on it learns that there are particular sounds which attach
to particular objects, and cause them to function. The sound "Mama," for
example, produces a goddess clothed in beauty and power, performing
miracles. So the infant mind arrives at the "period of magic gestures"
and the "period of magic words"; corresponding to a certain type of myth
and belief which we find in every race and tribe of human being that now
exists or ever has existed on earth. All these stories about magic
wishes and magic rings and magic spells of a thousand sorts; and nowhere
on earth a child which does not listen greedily to such fancies! The
reason is simply that the child has passed through this stage of mental
life, and so recently that the feelings are close to the surface of his
consciousness.

But gradually the infant makes the painful discovery that not everything
in existence can be got to serve him; there are forces which are proof
against his magic spells; there are some which are hostile, and these
the infant learns to regard with hatred and fear. Sometimes hatred and
fear are strangely mixed with admiration and love. For example, there is
a powerful being known as "father," who is sometimes good and useful,
but at other times takes the attention of the supremely useful "mother,"
the source of food and warmth and life. So "father" is hated, and in
fancy he is wished out of the way--which to the infant is the same thing
as killing. Out of this grows a whole universe of fascinating mental
life, which Freud calls by the name "the [OE]dipus complex"--after the
legend of the Greek hero who murdered his father and committed incest
with his mother, and then, when he discovered what he had done, put out
his own eyes. There is a mass of legends, old as human thought,
repeating this story; we cannot be sure whether they have grown out of
the greeds and jealousies of this early wish-life of the infant, or
whether they had their base in the fact that there was a stage in human
progress in which the father really was killed off by the sons.

This latter idea is discussed by Freud, in his book, "Totem and Taboo."
It appears that primitive man lived in hordes, which were dominated by
one old male, who kept all the women to himself, and either killed the
young males, or drove them out to shift for themselves; so the young men
would combine and murder their father. The forming of human society, of
marriage and the family, depended upon one factor, the decision of the
young victors to live and let live. The only way they could do this was
to agree not to quarrel over the women of their own group, but to seek
other women from other groups. This may account for what is known as
"exogamy," an almost universal marriage custom of primitive man, whereby
a man named Jones is barred by frightful taboos from the women named
Jones, but is permitted relations with all the women named Smith.

To return to our infant: he is in the midst of a painful process of
adjusting himself to the outside world; discovering that sometimes all
his magic words and gestures fail, his wishes no longer come true. There
are beings outside him, with wills of their own, and power to enforce
them; he has to learn to get along with these beings, and give up his
pleasures to theirs. These processes which go on in the infant soul, the
hopes and the terrors, the griefs and the angers, are of the profoundest
significance for the later adult life. For nothing gets out of the mind
that has once got into it; the infantile cravings which are repressed
and forgotten stay in the unconscious, and work there, and strive still
for expression. The conscious mind will not tolerate them, but they
escape in the form of fairy-tales and stories, of dreams and delusions,
slips of the tongue, and many other mental events which it is
fascinating to examine. Also, if we are weakened by ill health or
nervous strain, these infantile wishes may take the form of "neuroses,"
and fully grown people may take to stammering, or become impotent, or
hysterical, or even insane, because of failures of adjustment to life
that happened when they were a year or two old. These things are known,
not merely as a matter of theory, but because, as soon as by analysis
these infant secrets are brought into consciousness and adjusted there,
the trouble instantly ceases.

So it appears that the whole process of human life, from the very hour
of birth, consists of the correct adjustment of men and women in
relation to their fellows. Not merely is man a social being, but all the
prehuman ancestors of men, for ages upon geologic ages, have been
social beings; they have lived in groups, and their survival has
depended upon their success in fitting themselves snugly into group
relationships. Failure to make correct adjustments means punishment by
the group, or by enemies outside the group; if the failure is serious
enough, it means death. We may assert that the task of understanding
one's fellow men, and making one's self understood by them, is the most
important task that confronts every individual.

And if we look about the world at present, the most superficial of us
cannot fail to realize that the task is far from being correctly
performed. So many people unhappy, so many striving for what they cannot
get! So many having to be locked behind bars, like savage beasts,
because they demand something which the world is resolved not to let
them have! So many having to be killed, by rifles and machine-guns, by
high explosive shells and poison gas--because they misunderstood the
social facts about them, and thought they could fulfill some wishes
which the rest of mankind wanted them to repress! As I read the
psycho-analyst's picture of the newly born infant with its primitive
ego, its magic cries and magic gestures, I cannot be sure how much of it
