His upper-lip was just a little raised. It was as though he had seen
something that pleased him and of which he was about to tell.

"Daddy!"

Jones followed her. He drew down the rug and bent over. After a moment,
he drew the rug up, well up, and, with a forefinger, saluted.

Cassy, tearing the covering back, flung herself there. Jones could not
see her tears. He heard them. Her slim body shook.




XXXI


On leaving the walk-up Jones discovered a restaurant that he judged
convenient and vile. But the convenience appealed, and the villainy of
the place did not extend to the telephone-book, which was the first
thing he ordered.

While waiting for it, it occurred to him that in a novel the death he
had witnessed would seem very pat. Why is life so artificial? he
wonderingly asked.

The query suggested another. It concerned not the decedent but his
daughter.

By the Lord Harry, he told himself, her linen shall not be washed in
public if I can prevent it, and what is the use in being a novelist if
you can't invent?

But now the book was before him. In it he found that Dunwoodie resided
near Columbia University. It was ages since he had ventured in that
neighbourhood, which, when finally he got there, gave him the agreeable
sensation of being in a city other than New York.

Hic Labor, Haec Quies, he saw written on the statue of a tall maiden,
and though, in New York, quiet is to be had only in the infrequent
cemeteries, deep down, yet with the rest of the inscription he had been
engaged all day.

Gravely saluting the maiden, who was but partly false, he passed on to
an apartment-house and to Dunwoodie's door, which was opened by
Dunwoodie himself. In slippers and a tattered gown, he was Hogarthian.

"I thought it a messenger!" he bitterly exclaimed.

Jones smiled at him. "When a man of your eminence is not wrong, he is
invariably right. I am a messenger."

In the voice of an ogre, Dunwoodie took it up. "What is the message,
sir?"

Jones pointed at the ceiling. Involuntarily, Dunwoodie looked up and
then angrily at the novelist.

"An order of release," the latter announced.

Dunwoodie glared. "I suppose, sir, I must let you in, but allow me to
tell you----"

Urbanely Jones gestured. "Pray do not ask my permission, it is a
privilege to listen to anything you may say."

Dunwoodie turned. Through a winding hall he led the way to a room in
which a lane went from the threshold to a table. The lane was bordered
with an underbush of newspapers, pamphlets, magazines. Behind the
underbush was a forest of books. Beside the table were an armchair and a
stool. From above, hung a light. Otherwise, save for cobwebs, the room
was bare and very relaxing.

Dunwoodie taking the chair, indicated the stool. "Now, sir!"

Jones gave him the declaration.

With not more than a glance Dunwoodie possessed himself of the contents.
He put it down.

"If I had not known you had studied law, not for a moment would that
rigamarole lead me to suspect it."

In a protest which was quite futile, Jones raised a hand. "The notary is
unnecessary, I know that. I know also that a dying declaration is not
the best evidence, but----"

"Do you at least know that the declarant is dead?"

Jones, who favoured the dramatic, nodded. "He died in my arms."

Dunwoodie took it in and took it out. "It is curious how crime leads to
bad taste."

Jones leaned forward. "I may tell you for your information----"

"Spare me, I am overburdened with information as it is."

Jones sat back. He had no intention of taking Dunwoodie then behind the
scenes. That would come later. But he did want to try out an invention
that had occurred to him. He sighed.

"Don't you care to hear why he did it?"

"Not in the least."

"But----"

Dunwoodie fumbled in a pocket. "The district attorney may be more
receptive. I shall go to him in the morning and I will thank you to go
with me."

"I am not up in the morning."

"Then don't go to bed."

From the pocket, Dunwoodie extracted an enormous handkerchief. It
fascinated Jones. He had never seen one that resembled it.

"You dispose of me admirably. The district attorney, I suppose, will
enter a nolle prosequi."

In that handkerchief, Dunwoodie snorted. "You may suppose what you
like."

Jones laughed. "It is my business to suppose. I suppose, when the murder
was committed, that Lennox was at home. If I am right, he has an alibi
which his servant can confirm."

Dunwoodie stared. "Whatever your business may be, it is not to teach me
mine."

Jones drew out a cigarette-case. "Let me sit at your feet then. What
does Lennox say?"

"How inquisitive you are! But to be rid of you, he----"

"May I smoke?" Jones interrupted.

"Good God, sir! You are not preparing to make a night of it?"

"I have one or two other little matters in hand. But since I may suppose
all I like, I take it that Lennox intended to go to the opera, though I
fancy also that he had no intention of going to Paliser's box. I suppose
that he intended to wait about and go for him hot and heavy when he came
out. I suppose also that, while dressing, he changed his mind. And, by
the way, isn't there such a writ as a mandamus, or a duces tecum? I
would like my paper-cutter returned."

"Confound your paper-cutter! You don't deserve to have me admit it, but
Lennox' account of it is that before going on to the opera, he stopped
to write a letter to Miss--er--Hum! Ha!"

"Miss Austen?"

"And when he got through it was midnight."

"I'll lay a pippin he didn't send it."

"What, sir?"

"Lennox had a lot to say. It was gagging him. He would have suffocated
if he had kept it in. The effect of getting it on black and white was an
emetic. He read it over, judged it inadequate, tore it up. I have done
the same thing. I daresay you have."

The great man sat back. "His scrap-basket has been visited. The letter
was there."

"Well, then, I suppose the short and long of it is, you will have him
out to-morrow."

"As I said, you may suppose all you like."

"Without indiscretion then, may I suppose that you live here alone?"

Dunwoodie flourished his handkerchief. It was cotton and big as a towel.

"I am not as young as you are, sir, and whether erroneously or not, I
believe myself better informed."

"Ah!" Jones put in. "Your physiognomy corroborates you. I have sometimes
thought that it were difficult for the Seven Sages to be as wise as you
look--which is the reason, perhaps, why I do not quite follow you."

"I did not imagine that you would. You are a sociable being. Every
imbecile is pitiably sociable. But for a thinking man, a man without
vices and without virtues, what is there except solitude?"

Appreciatively Jones motioned. "Thank you for descending to my level. As
it happens, I also have a cloister where I have the double advantage of
being by myself and of not being with others. But now that I am in your
hermitage, there is this Matter of Ziegler, concerning which I would
like the benefit of your professional advice."

"Hum! Ha! Got yourself mixed up with a woman and want me to pull you
out. Well, sir, you will find it expensive. But a hermitage is not an
office. I shall expect you at mine to-morrow. I shall expect you before
ten."
