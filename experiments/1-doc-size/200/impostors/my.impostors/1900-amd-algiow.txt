Roger was, by far.

And then came the plans for housekeeping. Roger and she inspected some
houses. It would be more convenient in Washington, but Georgetown was
much prettier. And there were suburban districts.

"But think of the winter nights in the rain and the mud, and sometimes
sleet, and the time wasted going back and forth. Isn't it a bit of
patriotism to want to build up one's own city? We are a small people as
yet, compared to some other places. If we don't increase and multiply
and spread out, and fill up our vacant squares, our honor may be taken
from us."

"After so noble an argument I shall have to agree with you that it is
our bounden duty to remain," replied Jaqueline with an arch smile.

"Mother would like us at Georgetown, but she has Ralph and his wife."

"Oh, do stay!" cried Annis. "I like Washington so much!"

"The casting vote. We remain. Annis, you are to come with us. We
couldn't give you up now."

"Until mamma comes home. Of course I belong to her."

They went down to the old plantation, and the house slaves made a big
feast; the field hands had an illumination of lanterns and big pine
knots. But Annis thought the great house lonely. Then she recalled what
her father once said--when all the children were married she would
stay there with her mother and him. Jaqueline and Patty and Varina
would have husbands and children, and Annis shivered at a strange
consciousness of solitude.

Jaqueline had been instructed to take her outfit, and anything she
wanted, her father said. Chloe knew all about the bed and table linen:
didn't she bleach it up every spring in May dew? Such a packing, such a
rejoicing time over missy's husband "that she got at last," which meant
nothing derogatory nor that she had made a great effort; only most of
the slaves had great faith in first loves for white folks, and a happy
ending to an engagement.

There was the house to put in order and the "house-warming" to give, a
grand dinner for married friends and a dance for the young people, when
Louis was master of ceremonies, and bright eyes grew still brighter
with pleasure at his notice.

Almost before one had noted, there were cool nights and ripening
foliage, house-cleaning, and preparation for winter. Ah, how lovely
the banks of the Potomac were, and Rock Creek! Jaqueline begged that
they should take their first ride over again. There were various first
things to do. The mother over at Georgetown claimed them frequently.
Ralph's wife was very nice and sweet, but Jaqueline brought a curious
stir and dazzle in the house, and an atmosphere as of a spring morning.

Charles had improved wonderfully. There were some remarkable springs
up the Hudson that had wonderful health-giving properties. And when
they came back to New York he was so taken with the advantages that
he begged to remain. The doctor in whose charge he had been, promised
to watch over him and not allow him to study too severely, and a nice
boarding place had been found for him with a charming motherly woman.

"Oh, Annis!" cried her mother, holding her off after the first fond
embrace, "let me look at you. I have lost my little girl!"

"Mamma, I couldn't stay little always. But the part that loves and
thinks doesn't change, and I have tried very hard sometimes not to want
you when I knew Charles needed you. I am so glad to get you back! Oh,
you do believe that? But there is a queer thing I don't understand.
When we first came to Virginia it was very hard to try to love the
others when they took so much attention."

She was studying her mother with large, earnest, lustrous eyes.

"Yes," said Mrs. Mason, with a fond embrace.

"And now I love them all so much. I'm not quite sure about Varina--I
have not seen her in so long. But I love you the best."

The mother kissed her fondly. No one, not even her husband, who was so
grateful for the sacrifice she had made, knew how hard a trial it had
been to her.

Just as they were considering whether they could leave Annis at school
and do without her, word came from the Pineries. Mrs. Floyd had a
sudden stroke, not so very severe, but at her time of life a serious
matter.

Young Mrs. Floyd and her husband and Varina came North a few days after
this. There was a month of slow wasting away. Mrs. Brandon Floyd had a
new baby, Marian was almost worn out, and Mrs. Mason found herself the
comforter again, and much needed. Then grandmamma slipped out of life,
and was laid by the side of Mr. Floyd; and Mr. Mason, seconded warmly
by his wife, insisted that Marian should spend the winter with them and
rest, perhaps make it her future home.

Varina was a tall, rather distinguished-looking girl who had blossomed
somewhat prematurely into womanhood. Annis was still a little girl
beside her. She was gay and bright, and full of her own good times.
Jaqueline's marriage was delightful; they had enjoyed the account in
the paper. Charles was well again, but what a sad time it had been for
him! As for herself, she and Dolly were the dearest of sisters, and
had had the best of times. She should coax papa to let her return to
Charleston. She knew so many people there, and it would be just horrid
to go back to the old plantation. There were all the others, and surely
papa could spare her.

Dolly was very exigent as well. Mr. Mason realized that it would be
dull for a young girl, with the household in mourning, and Marian half
an invalid and dispirited. But he insisted upon a family gathering at
Christmas, as Charles was to come home.

Mrs. Carrington would fain have had Roger and his wife, and Mr. Brandon
Floyd sent a formal invitation for Jane and her family at the Pineries,
but she chose the Masons instead. Marian was pale and grave, but
improving under the fostering care of Mrs. Mason, who was the kindest
of sisters. Bessy Collaston had a new little brother; and, with Dolly's
one and Mrs. Jettson's four, there was quite an array of children.

But the most joyous of all was the welcome to Charles. Now he showed
his real improvement. He had some color in his cheeks and his eyes were
bright and lustrous; his voice rang with a clear sound.

Curiously enough, he seemed almost a stranger to Annis, and not the
little boy with whom she had poured over Froissart. She had outgrown
him; and as for Varina, she patronized him in a most uncomfortable
fashion. They were all so glad to see him well once more that no one
thought of teasing him, even when he aired his new-found knowledge
unduly. Perhaps he was most flattered by the friendliness of his big
brother-in-law Roger.

Then followed the dispersion. It was best that Annis should stay at
school the coming year, and Jaqueline declared she could not do without
her. Truth to tell, what with her school friends and her various
amusements, Annis began to feel as if Washington was her real home, and
the plantation a place to visit. Her mother had so many long-neglected
duties to take up, and Marian to nurse back to health and better
spirits. She had done without her little girl so long, and clearly this
was to the child's advantage.

Meanwhile the war had gone on with varying fortunes, but the navy of
the country had gained various accessions by capture from the British
and alterations from the merchant vessels. None of the coast cities
had been attacked. Boston, New York, and Philadelphia had been making
their defenses more secure. There was a fine fort at Baltimore. But
Washington made no advances. Congress wrangled over a hundred points.
The country at large was losing faith in the administration. There
was a growing party in favor of suing for peace on the best terms we
could get; another clique were quite certain we would wear out England,
as, after all, she had made no real gains, and we had become quite
formidable on the high seas.

General Armstrong, secretary of war, was confident Washington would
not be attacked; and though he admitted that defenses should be
strengthened, very little was done.

The downfall of Napoleon and his abdication, and the peace with France,
had released the flower of the British army, and many warships. It
was supposed Bermuda was their objective point, but they were ready
to harass the coast line from Florida to Maine, and filled many of the
towns with apprehension.




CHAPTER XIX.

IN THE MIDST OF WAR.


The summer of 1813 was destined to rouse the legislators at Washington
from their supineness. Some fishermen discovered a large fleet of
sail sweeping in between the royal capes and settling at anchor, as
if undetermined what course to pursue. They gave the alarm; and as
the ships sailed up the Chesapeake, Baltimore was believed to be the
objective point.

Commodore Barney's little fleet was chased up the Patuxent. General
Armstrong's orders were to burn it if there was danger of its falling
into the hands of the enemy. Then with his men he was to join General
Winder for the defense of Washington. The vessels were fired without a
single blow, and the men made a forced march across the peninsula.

There were no forts for protection, and only a few hundred regulars and
several militia companies. With fatuous obstinacy it was still believed
Baltimore would take the brunt of the attack, giving time to rally
the troops to the defense of Bladensburg if there should be an inland
march. All the adverse opinions and counsel delayed what might have
been done for the protection of the City.

But that August night, when the intentions of the enemy were beyond
all doubt, a courier spurred post-haste over the heavy, sandy roads and
through long stretches of somber pines and giant oaks, a very prophet
of evil. At the little post-towns of Nottingham and Marlborough the
stentorian tones roused the people from their sleep. "The British have
landed at Benedict and are marching inland. To arms! to arms!"

At Bladensburg he stopped at the ancient tavern, and the quiet town
was thrown into a panic. Everybody was called out for defense. Then on
to Washington, and the startled rulers looked into each other's faces
in dismay. And then Colonel Monroe admitted that though there were
