" You are not changed ; I find you quite the same." 

" I am sorry for that ! " And she turned away. 

"What are you doing?" he asked. "Where are 
you going 1" 

She looked about her, without answering, up and 





down the little terrace. The Casino at Blanquais 
was a much more modest place of reunion than the 
Conversation-house at Baden-Baden. It was a small, 
low structure of brightly painted wood, containing 
but three or four rooms, and furnished all along its 
front with a narrow covered gallery, which offered a 
delusive shelter from the rougher moods of the fine, 
fresh weather. It was somewhat rude and shabby 
— the subscriptioif for the season was low — but it 
had a simple picturesqueness. Its little terrace was 
a very convenient place for a stroll, and the great 
view of the ocean and of the marble- white crags 
that formed the broad gate- way of the shallow bay, 
was a sufficient compensation for the absence of 
luxuries. There were a few people sitting in the 
gallery, and a few others scattered upon the terrace ; 
but the pleasure-seekers of Blanquais were, for the 
most part, immersed in the salt water or dissemi- 
nated on the grassy downs. 

" I am looking for my mother," said Angela Vivian. 

" I hope your mother is well." 

" Very well, thank you." 

" May I help you to look for her ? " Bernard asked. 

Her eyes paused in their quest, and rested a mo- 
ment upon her companion. 

" She is not here," she said presently. " She has 
gone home." 

" What do you call home ? " Bernard demanded. 





"The sort of place that we always call home; a 
bad little house that we have taken for a month." 

" Will you let me come and see it ? " 

" It 's nothing to see." 

Bernard hesitated a moment. 

" Is that a refusal ? " 

" I should never think of giving it so fine a name." 

"There would be nothing fine in forbidding me 
your door. Don't think that!" said Bernard, with' 
rather a forced laugh. 

It was difficult to know what the girl thought; 
but she said, in a moment — 

" We shall be very happy to see you. I am going 
home." 

" May I walk with you so far ? " asked Bernard. 

"It is not far; it's only three minutes." And 
Angela moved slowly to the gate of the Casino. 



XX. 

Bernard walked beside her, and for some moments 
nothing was said between them. As the silence con- 
tinued, he became aware of it, and it vexed him that 
she should leave certain things unsaid. She had asked 
him no question — neither whence he had come, nor 
how long he would stay, nor what had happened to 
him since they parted. He wished to see whether 
this was intention or accident. He was already com- 
plaining to himself that she expressed no interest in 
him, and he was perfectly aware that this was a ridic- 
ulous feeling. He had come to speak to her in order 
to tell her that he was going away, and yet, at the 
end of five minutes, he had asked leave to come and 
see her. This sudden gyration of mind was grotesque, 
and Bernard knew it ; but, nevertheless, he had an 
immense expectation that, if he should give her time, 
she would manifest some curiosity as to his own situ- 
ation. He tried to give her time ; he held his tongue ; 
but she continued to say nothing. They passed along 
a sort of winding lane, where two or three fishermen's 
cottages, with old brown nets suspended on the walls 
and drying' in the sun, stood open to the road, on the 







other side of which was a patch of salt-looking grass, 
browsed by a donkey that was not fastidious. 

"It's so long since we parted, and we have so 
much to say to each other ! " Bernard exclaimed at 
last, and he accompanied this declaration with a 
laugh much more spontaneous than tlie one he had 
given a few moments before. 

It might have gratified him, however, to observe 
that his companion appeared to see no ground for 
joking in the idea that they should have a good deal 
to say to each other. 

" Yes, it 's a long time since we spent those pleas- 
ant weeks at Baden," she rejoined. " Have you been 
there again 1 " 

This was a question, and though it was a very sim- 
ple one, Bernard was charmed with it. 

" I wouldn 't go back for the world ! " he said. 
"And you?" 

"Would I go back? Oh yes; I thought it so 
agreeable." 

With this he was less pleased; he had expected 
the traces of resentment, and he was actually disap- 
pointed at not finding them. But here was the little 
house of which his companion had spoken, and it 
seemed, indeed, a rather bad one. That is, it was 
one of those diminutive structures which are known 
at French watering-places as " chalets," and, with an 
exiguity of furniture, are let for the season to families 





that pride themselves upon their powers of contrac- 
tion. This one was a very humble specimen of its 
class, though it was doubtless a not inadequate abode 
for two quiet and frugal women. It had a few inches 
of garden, and there were flowers in pots in the open 
windows, where some extremely fresh white curtains 
were gently fluttering in the breath of the neighbor- 
ing ocean. The little door stood wide open. 

"This is where we live," said Angela; and she 
stopped and laid her hand upon the little garden-gate. 

" It 's very fair," said Bernard. " I think it 's bet- 
ter than the pastry-cook's at Baden." 

They stood there, and she looked over the gate at 
the geraniums. She did not ask him to come in; 
but, on the other hand, keeping the gate closed, she 
made no movement to leave him. The Casino was 
now quite out of sight, and the whole place was per- 
fectly still. Suddenly, turning her eyes upon Bernard 
with a certain strange inconsequence — 

" I have not seen you here before," she observed. 

He gave a little laugh. 

" I suppose it 's because ! only-arrived this morn- 
ing. I think that if I had been here you would have 
noticed me." 

" You arrived this morning ? " 

" Three or four hours ago. So, if the remark were 
not in questionable taste, I should say we had not lost 
time." 





" You may say what you please," said Angela, sim- 
ply. " Where did you come from ? " 

Interrogation, now it had come, was most satisfac-
