brick-mould. 

By such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks 
obtained. This mill was but one of many others in operation 
at the time. The first one in Nevada was built at Egan Can- 
yon and was a small insignificant aftair and compared most 
unfavorably with some of the immense establishments after- 
wards located at Yirginia City and elsewhere. 

From our bricks a little corner was chipped off" for the- 
"fire-assay" — a method used to detennine the proportions of 
gold, silver and base metals in the mass. This is an interest- 
ing process. The chip is hammered out as thin as paper and 
weio-hed on scales so tine and sensitive that if vou welo;h a 
two-inch scrap of paper ou them and then write your name on 
the paper with a cource, soft pencil and weigh it again, the 

scales will take marked notice of the addition. Then a little 
lead (also weighed) is rolled up with the flake of silver and 
the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a 
cupel, made by compressing bone ashes into a cnp-shape in a 
steel mold. The base metals oxydize and are absorbed with 
the lead into the pores of the cupel. A button or globule of 
perfectl_y pure gold and silver is left behind, and by weighing 
it and noting the loss, the assayer knows the proportion of base 
metal the brick contains. He has to separate the gold from 
the silver now. The button is liammered out flat and thin, 
put in the furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after 
cooling it off it is rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass 
vessel containing niti-ie acid ; the acid dissolves the silver and 
leaves the gold pure and ready to be weighed on its own merits. 

Then salt water is poured into the vessel containing the dis- 
solved silver and the silver returns to palpable form again and 
sinks to the bottom. Nothing now remains but to weigh it ; 
then the proportions of the several metals contained in the 
brick are known, and the assayer stamps the value of the brick 
upon its surface. 

The sagacious reader will know now, without being told, 
that the speculative miner, in getting a " fire-assay " made of a 
piece of rock from his mine (to help him sell the same), was 
not in the habit of picking out the least valuable fragment of 
rock on his dump-pile, but quite the contrary. I have seen 
men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless quartz for an hour, 
and at last find a little piece as large as a filbert, which was 
rich in gold and silver — and this was reserved for a fire-assay ! 
Of course the fire-assay would demonstrate that a ton of such 

rock would yield hundreds 
of dollars — and on such as- 
says many an utterly worth- 
less mine was sold. 

Assaying was a good 
business, and so some men 
engaged in it, occasionally, 
who were not strictly scientific and capable. One 
assayer got siicli rich results 
out of all specimens brought 
to him that in time he 
accpiired almost a monopoly 
of the business. But like 
all men who achieve success, 
he became an object of envy 
and suspicion. The other 
assayers entered into a 
conspiracy against him, and let some prominent citizens into 
the secret in order to show that they meant fairly. Then they 
broke a little fragment off a carpenter's grindstone and got a 
stranger to take it to the popular scientist and get it assayed. 

In the course of an hour the result came — whereby it ap- 
peared that a ton of that rock would yield $1,284.40 in silver 
and $366.36 in gold ! 

Due publication of the whole matter was made in the 
paper, and the popular assayer left town " between two days." 

I will remark, in passing, that I only remained in the 
milling business one week. I told my employer I could not 
stay longer without an advance in my wages ; that I liked 
quartz milling, indeed was infatuated with it ; that I had 
never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in 
so sliort a time ; that nothing, it seemed to me, gave such 
scope to intellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening 
tailings, and nothing so stimulated the moral attributes as 
retorting bullion and washing blankets — still, I felt constrained 
to ask an increase of salary. 

He said he was paying me ten dollars a week, and thought 
it a good round sum. How much did I want ? 

I said about four hundred thousand dollars a month, and 
board, was about all I could reasonably ask, considering the 
hard times. 

I was ordered off the premises ! And yet, when I look 
back to those days and call to mind the exceeding hardness of 
the labor I performed in that mill, I only regret that I did not 
ask him seven hundred thousand. 

Shortly after this I began to grow crazy, along with the 
rest of the population, about the mysterious and wonderful 
" cement mine," and to make preparations to take advantage 
of any opportunity that might offer to go and helD hunt for it. 



CHAPTER XXXYII. 

IT was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that 
the marvellous Whiteman cement mine was supposed to 
lie. Every now and then it would be reported that Mr. W. 
had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of night, in 
dissruise, and then we would have a wild excitement — because 
he must be steering for his secret mine, and now was the time 
to follow him. In less than three hours after daylight all the 
horses and mules and donkeys in the vicinity would be bought, 
hired or stolen, and half the community woidd be oif for the 
mountains, following in the wake of "Whiteman. But W. would 
drift about through the mountain gorges for days together, in 
a purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the miners ran 
out, and they would have to go back home. I have known it 
reported at eleven at night, in a large mining camp, that White- 
man had just passed through, and in two hours the streets, so 
quiet before, would be swarming with men and animals. 
Every individual would be trying to be very secret, but yet 
venturing to whisper to just one neighbor that W. had passed 
through. And long before daylight — this in the dead of Win- 
ter — the stampede would be complete, the camp deserted, and 
the whole population gone chasing after W. 

The tradition was that in the early immigration, more than 
twenty years ago, three young Germans, brothers, who had 
survived an Indian massacre on the Plains, wandered on foot 
through the deserts, avoiding all trails and roads, and simply 
holding a westerly direction and hoping to find California 
before they starved, or died of fatigue. And in a gorge in the 
mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them 
noticed a cmrious vein of cement running along the ground, 
shot full of lumps of duU yellow metal. They saw that it was 
gold, and that here was a fortune to be acquired in a single day. 
The vein was about as wide as a curbstone, and fully two thirds 
of it was pure gold. Every pound of the wonderful cement was 

worth well-nigh $200. Each 
of the brothers loaded himself with aooui twenty-five 
pounds of it, and then they covered up all traces of tne 
ein, made a rude drawing 
of the locality and the principal landmarks in the vicin 
ity, and started westward 
again. But troubles thickened about them. In their 
wanderings one brother fell 
and broke his leg, and 
 the others were obliged to 
" oo on and leave him to die 
in the wilderness. Another, 
worn out and starving, gave  up by and by, and laid down 
to die, but after two or three 
weeks of incredible hard- 
ships, the third reached the 
settlements of California ex- 
hausted, sick, and his mind 
deranged by his suiferings. 
He had thrown away all his 
cement but a few fragments, 
but these were sufficient to 
set everybody wild with excitement. However, he had had 
enough of the cement country, and nothing could induce him 
to lead a party thither, lie was entirely content to work on 
a farm for wages. But he gave Whiteman his map, and 
described the cement resion as well as he could, and thus 
transferred the curse to that gentleman — for when I had my 
one accidental glimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been 
hunting for the lost mine, in hunger and thirst, poverty and 
sickness, for twelve or thirteen years. Some people believed 
he had found it, but most people believed he had not. I saw 
a piece of cement as large as my hst which Mas said to have 
been given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of 
a seductive nature. Luinps of virgin gold were as thick in it 
as raisins in a slice of fruit cake. Tiie privilege of working 
such a mine one week would be sufficient for a man of reason- 
able desires. 

A new partner of ours, a Mr. Higbie, knew Whiteman well 
by sight, and a friend of ours, a Mr. Yan Dorn, was well ac- 
quainted with him, and not only that, but had Whiteman's 
promise that he should have a private hint in time to enable 
him to join the next cement expedition. Van Dorn had prom- 
ised to extend the hint to us. One evening Iligbie came in 
greatly excited, and said he felt certain he had recognized, 
Whiteman, up town, disguised and in a pretended state of in- 
toxication. In a little while Van Dorn arrived and confirmed 
the news ; and so we gathered in our cabin and with heads 
close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers. 

We were to leave town quietly, after midnight, in two 
or three small parties, so as not to attract attention, and 
meet at dawn on the " divide " overlooking Mono Lake, eight
