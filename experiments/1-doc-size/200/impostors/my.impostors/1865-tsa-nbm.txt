John was quieter than usual at the dinner table. 
Occasionally, Mrs-. Guy detected a look of inquiry, sent 
across to her half covertly. John was, evidently, in 
uneasy debate on the question as to her knowledge of 
his guilty inroad on her purse. 

The first course had passed, and they were nearly 
through with the dessert, when Mrs. Guy, without pre 
liminary, or warning, asked, looking at John 

" How much money did you take from my purse this 
morning ? " 

The suddenness with which she put the question dis 
concerted John. His face grew red, and there was 
some hesitation of manner, ere he responded, in an an 
gry, repellant tone, 



 

" I don't know what you mean." 

" You went to my drawer this morning ? " said Mrs. 
Guy, without the slightest sign of weakness in her even 
tones. 

" You sent me to your drawer," asseverated John, ve 
hemently. 

" I know." 

" You asked me to bring your purse. Edwin was 
present." And John glanced towards his brother, whose 
pale face betrayed his knowledge of, and participation in 
wrong. 

" Very true ; and you brought it. My question re 
ferred to the sum you took therefrom before delivering 
it into my hands." 

" Not one dollar ! " said John, angry and positive ; 
and he offered a startling oath in confirmation of his 
denial, shocking and astonishing every one at the table. 

All this while Mr. Guy had remained silent, like one 
half stupefied. Now he aroused himself, and in a loud 
voice, looking at John, cried out, 

" Silence, sir ! How dare you use such language 
here ? " 

" I dare anything when falsely accused, sir," answer 
ed the boy, boldly. 

" When my purse was taken into your hands, it con 
tained twenty-four dollars ; and when you placed it in 
mine, the contents were reduced to eighteen," said Mrs. 
Guy, speaking slowly but firmly. " Ten minutes before 
you went for my purse, you refused to get me a book from 
the library ; but, when the request to bring my purse was 
made, you were off with a spring. It is useless for you to 



 

deny the fact of taking six dollars. I saw it in your face, 
as you handed me my purse. In a little while after 
wards, you went out with Edwin, and were gone all the 
morning spending the money of course, and not, as 
I have satisfied myself, in the best and safest way. The 
stale fumes of an oyster cellar were in your clothes, and 
the smell of liquor on your breaths. I noted the fact 
well." 

John alone, might have braved his stepmother out, in 
positive denial ; but, the tell-tale face and manner of 
Edwin, turned his father's attention to him ; and a few 
sternly put queries brought out a clear confession of the 
truth. 

" There is only one safe thing to be done," said Mrs. 
Guy, to her husband, when they were alone. " Edwin 
must be saved from the ruin into which John will cer 
tainly drag him, if they are left together. Edwin is 
weak and easily influenced. Since John came home, I 
see a change for the worse going on daily." 

" I shall send him away to school," was the positive 
answer of Mr. Guy. " He must not remain at home 
for a single week longer.'' 

And he did not. Just as Mrs. Guy had planned, the 
event came out. Edwin was sent away from home, 
and kept as liberally supplied with pocket money by his 
step-mother, as John had been. Unhappily for the fu 
ture of the boy's life, the effect was just what Mrs. Guy 
designed that it should be. Temptations spread them 
selves all along his unguarded path, and his feet were 
ever wandering;. 




CHAPTER XXVII. 



NOTWITHSTANDING the threatening 
attitude assumed by Mrs. Guy not 
withstanding the marshalling of her for 
ces it was no part of her plan to risk 
a serious battle, if that desperate issue 
could be avoided. By a resolute bear 
ing she made strategy the more success 
ful. The fact, that Mr. Guy believed 
her when she said that she would leave 
his house rather than permit his children to exercise a 
dominant influence, caused him the more readily to 
fall in with her wily plans for removing them to a dis 
tance. 

For awhile John held himself coldly aloof from his 
stepmother ; but she, after Edwin's departure for school, 
gradually broke down the wall of angry reserve which 
he had thrown up between them, and assumed a degree 
of interest in the boy that, with a little indulgence in 
spending money, laid his mind open to almost any influ 
ence she might choose to exercise. 

" This idle life, for one of your age, is dreadful, 
Jonn," she said to him, as they were alone, one morn 
ing, speaking in a tone of interest. 

" Oh, well, father's rich ! " he answered, tossing his 



 

head in an independent, don't care sort of way 
" there's no use in my doing anything. A gentleman's 
life for me." 

" For shame, John ! Anything but a drone or an 
idler. Adam goes to the counting-room every day." t 

" Adam ! Pish ! " And John curled his lip. " He'd 
eat dirt for a dollar, and then bury the money after it 
was earned." 

"Adam loves money too well, I know," said Mrs. 
Guy ; " but he's willing to earn it." 

" Don't quote him to me," returned John, with some 
impatience, " the mean, stingy fellow ! Let him earn 
his money and keep it, if he will ; but don't hold him 
up as my exemplar." 

" I'll tell you what I've been thinking, John," said 
his stepmother, changing her tone, and speaking in a 
way meant to inspire him with the thought in her mind. 
" You'd like to see the world, I know. Every young 
man does. Your father's firm is loading a vessel for 
the Pacific. Now, why not go in her as supercargo ? " 

John started up, and stood, all interest for a moment 
or two ; then clapping his hands together, he replied, 
while a warm flush came into his face 

" I'd like that ! But " And his countenance 
changed a little. 

"What?" 

" Father would say no." 

" I'm not so sure of that, John. But, would you 
really like the place ? " 

" Of supercargo ? " 

"Yes." 



 

"Grandly! I've always had a wish logo to sea." 
There was an eagerness in John's manner that showed 
how strongly the idea was taking hold of him. 

'' I do not believe that your father, on reflection, will 
object," said Mrs. Guy. 

" Will you ask him about it ? " 

" Yes. And I think you'd better leave the matter
