He took the thought with him to the library, 
where he stirred the fire and lighted his cigar. Of 
course sometime he would have his little boy. He 
felt now that it was best not to be in too great 
a hurry, but let them all get familiar with the idea. 
He would have the others over one or two at a 
time. But there ought to be some tender, womanly 
heart to mother Chan when he came. Little Chan 
with the beautiful voice scarcely any one was 
aware of. It must be worth something if Mr. 
Gwynne wanted to take it in hand. 

His cigar went out and he fell into a half-doze 
A woman came and clasped her soft hands under 
his chin, laid her warm cheek against his — his 
wife — the wife of some of the stories he had 
read. Well — he could count on a quarter of a 
century before real old age, and he would have 
her to travel down the decline with. Chan for 
a son, but he could not decide whether the daugh- 
ter should be Prim or Marigold. 

There was another light fall of snow in the 
night, but the morning was fine. The east was all 
aflame with summer-time radiance. The sky was a 
peerless blue with here and there a white drift 


 

sailing over it. Every twig was outlined and shone 
as if crested with diamonds. It was good to be 
alive, Adonijah Mann thought, and he uttered a 
reverent Thanksgiving. 

Dan,” he exclaimed after breakfast, pile the 
sleigh up with blankets and things and bring over 
every soul, if you have to pack the twins on the 
sleigh bottom. Otherwise you will have to go over 
again. Mind, now.” 

The horses came down the drive jingling the 
silvery bells; Lady Betty was the least bit arrogant 
and held her head high. What a pretty team they 
were ! 

Really the avenue was in a sort of gala proces- 
sion. Ridgewood people liked this road, it was so 
wide, straight, and smooth. Gay loads in fine 
array passed and repassed. One stopped at the 
Chedisters’ and let out a stylish party. 

“ So they are going to keep Thanksgiving, too! ” 
Mr. Mann said to himself. 

Everything seemed to fly past. How he hoped 
nothing had happened ! 

There was great flurrying and scurrying in the 
little old house. The children had been scrubbed 
the night before, but if Amaryllis couldn’t put the 
ethics of dust in as exquisite language as Ruskin, 


 

she fought it in a way that would have appalled 
him. She dressed the twins and placed them on 
a chair and told them if they stirred they would 
be left at home, which she didn’t quite mean, of 
course, and they looked at each other with big 
eyes and quivering lips. 

Linn brought in a great pile of wood and some 
splendid kindlings, so they could start the fire at 
night, and he put a big log in the stove so it would 
last some hours. Then they heard the jingling of 
the merriest bells. 

‘‘ Well, if that isn’t supersplacious, and mag- 
nificently grand ! ” declared Marigold. Oh, why 
don’t we live down in the village and set everybody 
wild with envy! Another beautiful horse and a 
sleigh like Noah’s ark! Look, Chan, look!” 

Mrs. Firth had not been quite sure they would 
all go. Now she meekly gave Dan his way. 
There never had been anything like that ride in 
their lives. 

“ I feel as if I wanted to sing, ‘ On a Christmas 
morning,’ ” declared Marigold. ‘‘ Why, isn’t it 
Christmasy and fine? I know we sha’n’t have as 
gay a time at Christmas.” 

“ Maybe we’ll all go over there again,” subjoined 
Chan hopefully. 

“ Oh, children, I hope you won’t act as if you 


 

had just come out of the woods,” said their 
mother. 

“ They’re ob-ster-epper-epperous,” declared Tip. 

“ I should have put in two more syllables,” re- 
marked Prim. 

They huddled up together and their laughter 
made echoes on the frosty air. 

One of the guests was standing in Mrs. 
Chedister’s bay window, and called to her. 

Oh, Emily, come and look at this load of chil- 
dren! Six, seven, eight. Do you suppose they 
are Institution young ones.'' They’re in hoods 
and motley array. And there’s a woman. Who 
lives next door?” 

Gladys came with a quickened step. Now they 
were laughing as they ran up the walk. 

“Well, there is a raft of them!” replied Mrs. 
Chedister. “ A Mr. Mann who is ” 

“What a beautifully matched team! Has he 
plenty of money?” 

“ I should think so. The Gedneys were in 
trouble and the place had to be sold. He’s a wid- 
ower, Grace,” laughing. 

“ Can’t we make some excuse to go in ? Does 
he have these parties often? ” 

“ There were some children there in the summer. 


 


you know, mamma,” interposed Gladys. And 
they had such a good time.” 

“ Good time ! I thought they would tear things 
to pieces. They were Irish, I guess, and one had 
red hair.” 

‘‘ Well, I suppose they don’t belong to him,” 
said Miss Grace Lawton. 

“ They ” were getting out of wraps upstairs in 
one of the rooms and came down in a sort of 
string, the twins bashfully hanging back. Rilla 
said you had to coax them to come to you and 
then coax them to stay away. And oh, how they 
had been scrubbed and scoured and rinsed until 
they shone painfully! Rilla didn’t know about 
talcum powder taking the shine off, and hadn’t 
any if she had known. Those finger nails had 
been a task of long-suffering and patience. 

But somehow they were in a huddle about Mr. 
Mann, their nicely brushed heads being tousled, 
and they nearly all talked at once while he kissed 
here and there and said, Have I been all around ? 
Hadn’t I better go again for fear I’ve missed 
somebody ? ” 

Oh, Miss Lawton, what would you have said 
to that! 

“ I ’ant to put a tiss in the hole in your cheek,” 
exclaimed Laurel, with infinite pains. 


 

So you may.” He lifted her up. How sweet 
and soft all the young lips were. That was the 
joy fathers had. 

I don’t see how you came to have such a dim- 
ple,” Marigold began complainingly. Men don’t 
need them. I wish I had it. Lai, take it out and 
give it to me.” 

Laurel put her small thumb and finger to the 
place and drew a long breath. 

I tan’t det it out.” 

“ Oh, Marigold ! ” said her mother, with a pink 
flush in her face that should have belonged to the 
girl.
