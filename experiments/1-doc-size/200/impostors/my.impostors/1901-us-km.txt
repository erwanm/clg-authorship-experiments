attract attention; and in what followed there was room for every
shading of tone, from delicate softness that showed much feeling and
sympathy, to stunning fortissimos that made everyone stare. The girl
was relieved of any possible fear by the certainty that the
composition was completely beyond her hearers’ understanding, and so
she soon lost herself in her task, and, as her excitement mounted,
played with splendid spirit and abandon. Her calculations proved
entirely well made, for when she stopped she received a real
ovation, having genuinely astonished her hearers; and she crossed
the room, beaming radiantly upon everyone and acknowledging their
compliments, more assured of triumph than ever before. To cap the
climax, when she reached her seat she found Mr. Harrison betraying
completely his profound admiration, his gaze being riveted upon the
glowing girl as she sat down beside him.

“Miss Davis,” he said, with evident sincerity, “that was really
wonderful!”

“Thank you very much,” said Helen, radiantly.

“It was the most splendid piano playing I have ever heard in my life,”
 the other went on. “Pray what was it that you played--something new?”

“Oh, no,” was the answer, “it is very old indeed.”

“Ah,” said Mr. Harrison, “those old composers were very great men.”

“Yes,” said Helen, demurely.

“I was astonished to see with what ease you played,” the other
continued, “and yet so marvelously fast! That must be a fearfully
hard piece of music to play.”

“Yes, it is,” said Helen; “but it is quite exciting,” she added,
fanning herself and laughing.

Helen was at the top of her being just then, and in perfect command
of things; she had no idea of letting herself be dragged down into
the commonplace again. “I think it’s about time I was fascinating
him,” she said to herself, and she started in, full of merriment and
life. Taking her last remark as a cue, she told him funny stories
about the eccentricities of the sonata’s great composer, how he
would storm and rage up and down his room like a madman, and how he
hired a boy to pump water over his head by the hour, in case of
emergency.

Mr. Harrison remarked that it was funny how all musicians were such
queer chaps, but even that did not discourage Helen. She rattled on,
quite as supremely captivating as she had been at the dinner table,
and as she saw that her companion was yielding to her spell, the
color mounted to her cheeks and her blood flowed faster yet.

It is of the nature of such flame to feed itself, and Helen grew the
more exulting as she perceived her success,--and consequently all
the more irresistible. The eyes of the man were soon riveted upon
the gorgeous vision of loveliness before him, and the contagion of
the girl’s animation showed itself even in him, for he brightened a
little, and was clever enough to startle himself. It was a new
delight and stimulus to Helen to perceive it, and she was soon swept
away in much the same kind of nervous delight as her phantasy with
the thunderstorm. The sofa upon which the two were seated had been
somewhat apart from the rest, and so they had nothing to disturb
them. A short half hour fled by, during which Helen’s daring
animation ruled everything, and at the end of which Mr. Harrison was
quite oblivious to everything about him.

There were others, however, who were watching the affair; the
keen-eyed Aunt Polly was comprehending all with joy, but she was as
ever calculating and prudent, and she knew that Helen’s monopoly of
Mr. Harrison would soon become unpleasantly conspicuous, especially
as she had so far introduced him to no one else. She felt that
little would be lost by breaking the spell, for what the girl was
doing then she might do any time she chose; and so after waiting a
while longer she made her way unobtrusively over to them and joined
their conversation.

Helen of course understood her aunt’s meaning, and acquiesced; she
kept on laughing and talking for a minute or two more, and then at a
lull in the conversation she exclaimed: “But I’ve been keeping Mr.
Harrison here talking to me, and nobody else has seen anything of
him.” And so Mr. Harrison, inwardly anathematizing the rest of the
company, was compelled to go through a long series of handshakings,
and finally to be drawn into a group of young persons whose
conversation seemed to him the most inane he had ever heard in his
life.

In the meantime someone else was giving a piano selection, one which
Helen had never heard, but which sounded to every one like a finger
exercise after her own meteoric flight; the girl sat half listening
to it and half waiting for her aunt to return, which Mrs. Roberts
finally did, beaming with gratitude.

“My love,” she whispered, “you are an angel; you have done better
than I ever dreamed of!”

And Helen felt her blood give a sudden leap that was not quite
pleasant; the surging thoughts that were in her mind at that moment
brought back the nervous trembling she had felt in the carriage, so
that she leaned against the sofa for support.

“Now listen, my dear,” the other went swiftly on, perhaps divining
the girl’s state, “I want you to do a great favor for me.”

“Was not that for you, Auntie?” asked Helen, weakly.

“No, my dear, that was for yourself. But this--”

“What is it?”

“I want you to come and talk to my David Howard a little while.”

The girl gave a start, and turned a little paler. “Aunt Polly,” she
exclaimed, “not now! He looks so ill, it makes me nervous even to
see him.”

“But, Helen, my dear, that is nonsense,” was the reply. “Mr. Howard
is one of the most interesting men you ever met. He knows more than
all the people in this room together, and you will forget he is an
invalid when you have talked to him a while.”

Helen was, or wished to think herself, upon the heights of happiness
just then, and she shrunk more than ever from anything that was
wretched. “Not now, Aunt Polly,” she said, faintly. “Please wait
until--”

“But, my dear,” said Aunt Polly, “now is the very time; you will
wish to be with Mr. Harrison again soon. And you must meet Mr.
Howard, for that is what he came for.”

“I suppose then I’ll have to,” said Helen, knitting her brows; “I’ll
stroll over in a minute or two.”

“All right,” said the other; “and please try to get acquainted with
him, Helen, for I want you to like him.”

“I will do my best,” said the girl. “He won’t talk about his
ailments, will he?”

“No,” said the other, laughing, “I fancy not. Talk to him about
music--he’s a great musician, you know.”

And as her aunt left the room, Helen stole a side glance at the man,
who was alone upon the sofa just then. His chin was still resting in
his hand, and he was looking at Helen as before. As she glanced at
him thus he seemed to be all head, or rather all forehead, for his
brow was very high and white, and was set off by heavy black hair.

“He does look interesting,” the girl thought, as she forced a smile
and walked across the room; her aunt entered at the same time, as if
by accident, and the two approached Mr. Howard. As he saw them
coming he rose, with some effort as Helen noticed, and with a very
slight look of pain; it cost her some resolution to give the man her
hand. In a minute or two more, however, they were seated alone upon
the sofa, Aunt Polly having gone off with the remark to Helen that
she had made Mr. Howard promise to talk to her about music, and that
they both knew too much about it for her. “You must tell Helen all
about her playing,” she added to him, laughingly.

And then Helen, to carry on the conversation, added, “I should be
very much pleased if you would.”

“I am afraid it is an ungracious task Mrs. Roberts has chosen me,”
 the man answered, smiling. “Critics are not a popular race.”

“It depends upon the critics,” said Helen. “They must be sincere.”

“That is just where they get into trouble,” was the response.

“It looks as if he were going to be chary with his praise,” thought
Helen, feeling just the least bit uncomfortable. She thought for a
moment, and then said, not without truth, “You pique my curiosity,
Mr. Howard.”

“My criticism could not be technical,” said the other, smiling,
again, “for I am not a pianist.”

“You play some other instrument?” asked Helen; afterwards she added,
mischievously, “or are you just a critic?”

“I play the violin,” the man answered.

“You are going to play for us this evening?”

“No,” said the other, “I fear I shall not.”

“Why not?” Helen inquired.

“I have not been feeling very well to-day,” was the response. “But I
have promised your aunt to play some evening; we had quite a long
dispute.”

“You do not like to play in public?” asked Helen.

The question was a perfectly natural one, but it happened
unfortunately that as the girl asked it her glance rested upon the
figure of her companion. The man chanced to look at her at the same
instant, and she saw in a flash that her thought had been misread.
Helen colored with the most painful mortification; but Mr. Howard
gave, to her surprise, no sign of offense.
