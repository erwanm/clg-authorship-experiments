CHAPTER XXVL 

MISFORTUNES. 

MADAMS FELIX went away the last of October, and for 
a month Queenie was very busy helping with the fall sew- 
ing. Miss Madeira might be an old maid, but few mothers 
could plan and execute so comfortably, or with such skill, 
and with less absolute worry. Dresses were marvellously 
lengthened or turned, or furbished up anew. Patching 
trousers and darning stockings became a fine art, and Tip 
supposed those natty jackets came straight from the 
tailors. 

Early in December Miss Madeira took a severe cold, and 
had an attack of pleurisy. She made a great effort to get 
about at Christmas, and have a nice gala dinner for the 
children, but she was worse afterward, with a run of low 
nervous fever, that kept her very weak, and made her now 
and then rather flighty. Then Moppet must needs get 
pushed down, one slippery day, at school, and break her 
arm. 

If the bad luck had stopped there! But just then it 
came in a pelting shower. Queenie had been so busy that 
it was the middle of January before she could go down to 
Hardham & Co. for their monthly allowance. 

"It is quite impossible to let you have any money to- 
day," said Mr. Jennings. "We have had some heavy losses, 
and hardly know what to do ourselves. Come down again 
in a week or ten days." 

Queenie went home rather dismayed. The rent was due, 
there was very little money in the house, and how could 
ehe stretch it over ten days? True, the grocer and the 





butcher might trust for a while ; they had coal and flour, 
and that was some comfort. 

" You must not worry Miss Madeira about anything," 
the doctor said. " Such a complete state of mental and 
nervous prostration rarely occurs, and unless she is kept 
quiet and cheerful I can hardly answer for the result." 

" Oh, you don't think she will die ? " cried Queenie, in 
sudden terror. 

" Well, I hardly think that. If it was pleasant weather 
I should send her to the sea-side ; indeed, a change would 
be the very best thing for her. Keep the children quiet, 
and, as I said, do not trouble her with the details of house- 
hold affairs." 

Poor Queenie ! She was well, and in spite of her slen- 
derness and delicate, high-bred air, she had a fund of 
strength, but all this was enough to dismay the stoutest 
heart. To whom could she go for counsel? And here 
were a troop of hungry, noisy children. 

" But they are so much better than they used to be," she 
mused, " and Moppet really is quite a thoughtful little lady ; 
but there is her broken arm, which does not improve one'a 
temper, and if there was only plenty of money " 

"Me darlint," said Peggy O'Brian, the good-hearted 
washerwoman, " don't you begin to worry now, jest. I've 
been through a-many tight time, whin I couldn't see bite 
nor sup for the next day, but praised be the saints, they 
made an openin' in the darkest cloud. 'An one time, whin 
I had three helpless little babies, as one may say, me poor 
Pat was brought home, scalded so the flesh dropped off of 
him, and lay for weeks and weeks. An' all his long sick- 
ness at the last but whirra ! I'm an old fool to try to 
brighten you with dead-and-gone troubles. Now look here, 
jest, I'm a little easy now, the two boys bein' in good 
places, thank the Lord, and me keepin' the won room with 
a handful of fire at night, but if ye'd say the word I'd come 
and stay here beside lookin' after the waslun' and ironin', 





and not a cent to pay till such time as you're forehanded 
agen ! " 

" Oh, how good you are ! " and Queenie seized her 
hand, pressing it between her dainty palms. 

" There's Monday at Mrs. Gales til' four, an' Tuesday 
half a day, an' Wednesday here, an' the sweepin' at Mrs. 
Carter's on Friday. That's the big boardin'-house, an' it 
takes all day, jest. But there's nights and mornin's, and 
you ought'nt be alone, ye swate pretty darlint." 

" If you only will come. It is so hard to see to every- 
thing." 

" Sure I'd run me feet off for you and Miss Madeiry, 
an' she's wasted away to a skeleton, jest. A better-hearted 
woman never lived, so me darlint, beauty's not everything 
m this world, though it's swate enough to look at whin 
it's such as you, with beauty for a dozen. An' now I'll 
come in the night, and all the time when I'm not busy." 

The kind offer lifted a load off of Queenie's shoulders, 
for Peggy was a great favorite with the babies. But when 
she went for the money she was put off again, and Peggy 
insisted upon her taking ten dollars of her savings to tide 
her over. 

The doctor finally decided that Miss Madeira must go 
nway. 

" She needs something to rouse her, to change the cur- 
rent of her thoughts. Wouldn't some friend in her native 
town take her for a while ? " he asked. 

Queenie wrote to Mrs. Wardlow, who said, in reply, 
"Send her immediately." 

" I must make one more effort," declared Queenie, and 
again went down to the shipping-house. 

Alas! The news was doubly bad. Hardham & Co. 
had stopped payment, and there was a report that the Lin- 
lithgow had been lost at sea. She went home stunned and 
incredulous. 

" It will never do to tell her," said Queenie, to faithful 




Peggy. "And it may not be quite so bad. Oh, what 
would become of the poor children ! And they are all 
improving so, and growing quite pretty. Miss Madeira 
meant to have them so nice when their poor father came 
back ; " and Queenie finished in a flood of tears. 

" There, me darlint, don't go out over the say to meet 
trouble. I've known people to come home after seven year, 
and everybody belay vin' 'em dead, but whirra ! it's bad 
about the money, jest." 

Then Queenie took Tip into confidence. He had not 
been doing very well through the winter, and business was 
dull now. 

"And I've borrowed of all the fellows I know," con- 
fessed Tip, ruefully. " I meant to beg a little out of aunt 
Madeira I say, Queenie, she has quite a pile of her 
own, hasn't she? She's never had anything to do but just 
save up her money." 

"Oh, Tip! I'm ashamed of you!" cried Qneenie, in- 
dignantly. " Why, when your mother was alive, Miss Ma- 
deira used to be sending little gifts, and she worked almost 
every day of her life at dress-making. And she hasn't 
much beside the house. Then she would not take any of 
the wages your father offered her, because she wanted to 
help him." 

" Well, if I had it I'd do anything. But five dollars a 
week is such a beggarly salary, and I don't see as I can 
help. But you don't believe that about father, Queen- 
ie ? It can't be true." 

" Oh, I hope not ! I pray not ! " returned Queenie, with 
quivering lip. " For I don't see how Miss Madeira could 
take care of everybody, even if she should get well. You 
see she has worked very hard. Oh, Tip, you never can 
know ! I want you to be good, and noble, and unselfish, 
for if part of this burden comes upon you " 

Tip hung his head. He was just a careless, selfish boy, 
iitent upon his own gratification, and feeling that the world 





used him rather hardly, in that it did not pour a golden 
shower at his feet. But to be asked to do something for 
others, why, how could he ? 

They packed off Miss Madeira. Queenie went with her to 
her journey's end, where Mrs. Wardlow met her, and then 
turned straight about for home. It was quite in the even- 
ing when the train returned, but Tip was watching for her, 
and took her on his arm with a sense of manliness and 
protection. How stylish and pretty she was ! And, after
