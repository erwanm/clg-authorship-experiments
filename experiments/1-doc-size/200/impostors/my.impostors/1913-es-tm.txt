distantly:

“The Helley-Quetgens have asked us to the Opéra. I am going. You are
free to do as you like.”

Here, obviously, was something new. At it and at her Barouffski looked
with shifting eyes. Uncertainly he rubbed his hands.

“But how then! I am at your orders. It is a festival to be where you
are.”

But as he did nothing without an object, he wondered what hers was.
Obviously, there was a reason. Yet, what? Could it be an olive branch?
He was too adroit to ask. Even otherwise, he lacked the opportunity.
Leilah had gone from the room.

It was in these circumstances that, on this night, she appeared at the
Opéra where Violet was complaining at having seen her with d’Arcy.

At the complaint, Silverstairs pulled at his moustache.

“I did not know that she had taken up with him.”

“I don’t know that she has either. But she was with him to-day in the
Champs Elysées.”

“Oh, come now! Things haven’t got to such a pass that a woman can’t be
seen with a man----”

“No, but no honest woman can be seen alone with d’Arcy. Leilah ought to
know better. She ought to know better too than to go to the Ritz. As
she does not appear to, I propose to tell her.”

“Do as you like,” replied Silverstairs who would have said the same
thing no matter what his wife had suggested. The lady had not entirely
Americanised this Englishman but she had at least made him realise the
futility of argument.

“Do as you like,” he repeated. “There are the Orlonnas. There are the
Zubaroffs.”

At once to the quick click of an ouvreuse’s key, the door opened and
Tempest appeared, a foulard showing above his coat.

While he removed these things Violet called at him:

“You’re late.”

Silverstairs laughed. “He always is. At Christ Church he was known as
the late Lord Howard.”

Tempest moved forward and sat down between them.

But now, to the volatile sweetmeats of the score, the curtain was
falling. In the stalls there was a movement. Men stood up, put their
hats on, turned their back to the stage or set forth for a chat with
the vestals in the green room.

Silverstairs also stood up.

Violet turned to him:

“I do wish you would look in on the Helley-Quetgens, and ask Leilah to
come to luncheon to-morrow. Say I have a bone to pick with her. That
may fetch her, if nothing else will.”

Tempest ran a hand through his vivid hair.

“A bone over what, if I may ask? You may not know it, but I greatly
admire Madame Barouffska.”

Violet smiled.

“She’s a dear. But I saw her to-day with d’Arcy, and I propose to scold
her for it.”

Tempest showed his teeth.

“D’Arcy is not a man’s man, though he certainly is a woman’s. Yet, when
you come to that, not such a woman as Madame Barouffska. What an odd
thing that was about her first husband!”

“You mean about the dogs?”

“Yes. I never got the rights of it. What was he doing there? Is she
living in the past?”

Violet raised her opera-glass.

“She would be very lucky if she could be; living in the present is so
expensive, don’t you think?”

Again there was a quick click. The door opened. Silverstairs, filling
the entrance with his tall stature, reappeared.

“Violet,” he began, “the Helley-Quetgens are going on to some dance
in the Faubourg, and Leilah wants the three of us to sup with her at
Paillard’s. What do you say?”

Violet laughed. “I say it will be just my chance.” She turned to
Tempest. “You will come?”

“Thanks, yes. Isn’t that de Fresnoy with the Zubaroffs?”

Silverstairs, without sitting down, raised his glass.

“Yes, and I was just saying, this is the first time since his duel that
I have seen him. But what an asinine affair that was! He lunged at
Barouffski’s neck, Barouffski knocked the foil up and pricked himself
on the chin with it. Then Barouffski’s surgeon stopped the fight on
the ground that it might interfere with his breathing. Fancy that!
Afterward, in the account given to the press, the surgeon described
the prick as an incisive wound in the hyoïdian region, accompanied by
a notable flow of blood. Anyone who did not know would have thought
that Barouffski had been nearly done for. But that’s a French duel for
you--a funeral at which everybody giggles.”

Tempest looked gravely up at his friend. “What did you have for dinner?”

Suspiciously, Silverstairs considered him.

“Why do you ask?”

“You are so expansive and brilliant.”

On the stage, the drama continued, poignantly, beatifically, in a
unison of violins and voices that was interrupted at last by the
usual stir in the stalls and boxes, by the haste to be going, to be
elsewhere, and a defile began; a procession of silken robes, gorgeous
cloaks, jeweled headgear, black coats, white ties; a procession that
presently filled the subscribers’ rotunda, from which, at sight of it,
grooms fled, then hurried back, touching their hats, eager and zealous.

Between the columns groups loitered, regarding each other with
indulgence, with indifference, at times with a loftiness that put
isolating zones about them; and women assumed that attitude which
women alone can assume, that attitude of being not only apart from the
crowd, but of being unaware of the crowd’s existence.

In the centre, Mme. Orlonna, an Italian princess, with a slight
moustache and an ancestry that extended to the super-Neronian days
of Heliogabalus, stood, laughing and talking, lisping Bonthoirs to
everybody.

Another princess, a Russian, Mme. Zubaroff, with a young girl at her
side, and an escort of blond giants, passed, inclining her head to the
left, to the right, bowing with a grace mechanical, but sovereign.

Beyond, Leilah appeared, d’Arcy on one side, Barouffski on the other.
Her face, ordinarily pale, was flushed, and her manner, usually
subdued, was animated. She was laughing, not loudly, but noticeably.

Violet, accompanied by Tempest and Silverstairs, approached. As the
men, after saluting the women, greeted each other, Violet tapped Leilah
with her fan.

“My dear, I have a bone to pick with you.”

Leilah, with a levity that was rare with her, interrupted:

“It is just for that we are going to supper. How will you have it,
grilled or deviled?”

“Her ladyship’s carriage is at the door,” a groom announced, in English.

Another added, in French: “The motor of madame la comtesse is advanced.”

“Yes,” Violet retorted. “But my bone belongs to a different kettle of
fish. Now, you come with me.” With a smile, she turned to the others.
“We will go in the brougham, and you take the motor.”

Stooping, she lifted her train, and the two women, accompanied by the
men, followed the groom to the carriage.

There, after seeing them in, Barouffski called:

“To Paillard’s, Chaussée d’Antin.”

At the glass door, which a chasseur opened, Barouffski stopped, spoke
to the man, gave him an order. As the others, conducted by a maître
d’hôtel, approached a table, a fat woman in a pulpit charged them,
before they were seated, with the use of the silver and the cloth.

Beyond, a band of Bohemians, costumed in crimson, were loosing, with
nervous and dirty fingers, whirlwinds of notes. The atmosphere, filled
with vibrations, fevered by the fury of the violins, dripped with
the scent of flowers, with the bouquet of burgundies, the smell of
champagne, the odour of tobacco and food.

At adjacent tables were demi-reps and foreigners, mondaines and
clubmen, a sprinkle of the cream of the venal, the exotic and the
ultra-chic, whom omnibuses and waiters, marshaled by maîtres d’hôtel,
served with the same deference and zeal.
