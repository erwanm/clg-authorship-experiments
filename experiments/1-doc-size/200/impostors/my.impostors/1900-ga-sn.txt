and I believed that it came straight from the Lord. 
It seemed to me that He was there and told me that 
was my only hope, to tell him myself before he found 
it out from your mother or Miss Trumbull. The idea 
never left me for a minute ; it possessed me. I was 
so afraid you wouldn't.have waited when I found out 
I was late, that they would tell him before I got 
home. But I wanted to tell him alone. When you 
ordered me not to leave the room, I felt like I wanted 
to do anything you told me, but when I found you 'd 
gone to sleep, I felt like I couldn't.wait another minute. I crawled out of the window and went to him. 
And perhaps I did right. I can't think it wasn't.an 
inspiration to confess and be forgiven before he found 
out for himself." 

Betty was in the living-room with Senator North 
when a letter from Jack Emory was brought to her. 
With it, also bearing the Washington postmark, was 



 

another, directed in an unfamiliar and illiterate hand. 
Betty, cold with apprehension, tore open Emory's 
letter. It read : 

DEAR BETTY, You know, of course, that my wife 
confessed to me the terrible fact that she has negro blood 
in her veins. My one impulse when she told me was 
to get back to my home like a beaten dog to its kennel. 
I did little thinking on the train ; whether I talked to 
people or whether I was too stupefied to think, I cannot 
tell you. But here I have done thinking enough. At 
first I hated, I loathed, I abhorred her. I resolved merely 
never to see her again, to ask you to send her to Europe 
as quickly as possible, to threaten her with exposure and 
arrest if she ever returned. But, Betty, although I have not 
yet forgiven her, although the thought of her awful hidden 
birthmark still fills me with horror and disgust, I know the 
weakness of man. The marriage is void according to the 
laws of Virginia, and I know that if I returned to her she 
would insist upon remarriage in a Northern State and I 
might succumb. And rather than do that, rather than dishonor my blood, rather than do that monstrous wrong, 
not only to my family but to the South that has my 
heart's allegiance as passionate an allegiance as if I 
had fought and bled on her battlefields I am going to 
kill myself. 

Do not for a moment imagine, Betty, that I hold you to 
account. I can guess why you did not warn me in the 
beginning, why you did not tell me when it was too 
late. Would that I had gone on to the end faithful to my 
ideal of you! My lonely years in this old house were 
brightened and made endurable with the mere thought of 
you. But man was not made to live on shadows, and I 
loved again, so deeply that I dare not trust myself to live. 

I send her only one message she must drop my name. 
She has no legal title to it according to the laws of Virginia ; 
the marriage would be declared void were it known that 
she had black blood in her. I would spare her shame and 



 

exposure, but she shall not bear my name, and it is my 
dying request that you use any means to make her drop it. 
Good-bye. JACK EMORY. 

Betty thrust the letter into Senator North's hand. 
" Read it ! " she said. " Read it ! Oh, do you suppose he has " 

Her glance fell on the other letter and she opened 
it with heavy fingers. It read : 

Mis BETTY, Marse Jack done shot himself. He tole 
me not to telegraf. 

Yours truly, JIM. 

Betty stood staring at Senator North as he read 
Jack's letter. When he had finished it, she handed 
him the other. He read it, then took her cold hands 
in his. 

"You must tell her," he said. "It is a terrible 
trial for you, but you must do it." 

" Ah ! " she cried sharply. " I believe you are 
thinking of me only, not of that poor girl." 

"My dear," he said, "that poor creature was 
doomed the moment she entered the world. No 
amount of sympathy, no amount of help that you or 
I could give her would alter her fate one jot. For 
all the women of that accursed cross of black and 
white there is absolutely no hope so long as they 
live in this country, at all events. They almost invariably have intelligence. If they marry negroes, 
they are humiliated. If they pin their faith to the 
white man, they become outcasts among the respectable 
Blacks by their own act, as the act of others has made 
them outcasts among the Whites. Their one compensation is the inordinate conceit which most of them 
possess. Do not think I am heartless. I have thought 
long and deeply on the subject. But no legislation 
can reach them, and the American character will have 
to be born again before there is any change in the 
social law. It is one of those terrible facts of life that 
rise isolated above the so-called problems. If Harriet 
lives through this, she will fall upon other miseries 
incidental to her breed, as sure as there is life about 
us, for she has the seeds of many crops within her. 
So it is true that all my concern is for you. In 
a way I helped to bring this on you; but you did 
what was right, and I have no regrets. And you 
must think of me as always beside you, not only ready 
to help you, but thinking of you constantly." 

She forgot Harriet for the moment. " Oh, I do," 
she said, " I do ! I wonder what strength I would 
have had through this if you had not been behind me." 

" You are capable of a great deal, but no woman 
is sl:rong enough to stand alone long. Send for Harriet 
to come here. I don't wish you to be alone with 
her when she hears this news." 

Betty rang the bell, and sent a servant for Harriet. 
She put Emory's letter in her pocket. 

"I shall not give her that terrible message of his 
until she quite has got over the shock of his death," 
she said. " Let her be his widow for a little while. 
Then she can go to Europe and resume her own 
name. She soon will be forgotten here." 

Harriet came in a few moments. She barely had 
sat down since she had risen after a restless night. 
But she had refused to talk even to Betty. As she 
entered the room and was greeted by one of those 






silences with which the mind tells its worst news, she 
fell back against the door, her hands clutching at her 
gown. Betty handed her the servant's letter. 

She took it with twitching fingers, and read it as 
if it had been a letter of many pages. Then she 
extended her rigid arms until she looked like a cross. 
" Oh, " she articulated. " Oh ! Oh ! " 

But in a moment she laughed. " I don't feel surprised, somehow," she said sullenly. " I suppose 
I knew all along he 'd do it. Every day that I live 
I'll curse your unjust and murderous race while other 
people are saying their prayers. May the black race 
overrun the world and taint every vein of blood upon 
it. For me, I accept my destiny. I 'm a pariah, an 
outcast. I'll live to do evil, to square accounts with 
the race that has made me what I am. I'll go back 
to that camp, and leave it with whatever negro will 
have me, and when I 'm so degraded I don't care 
for anything, I'll go out and ruin every white man 
I can. I'll keep the money you gave me, so that I'll 
be able to do more harm " 

"You can go," said Betty, "but not yet. You 
shall go with me first and bury your husband. If you 
attempt to escape until I give you permission, I shall 
have you locked up. I shall take two menservants 
with us. Now come upstairs with me and pack your 
portmanteau." 

She slipped her hand into Senator North's. " Good- 
bye," she said hurriedly. " I shall return Friday night. 
Please come over Saturday morning." 

Harriet preceded Betty upstairs, and obeyed her 
orders sullenly. Betty locked her in her room, and 
went to break the news to her mother. Mrs. Madison 



 

received it without excitement, remarking among her 
tears that it was one of the denouements she had imagined, and that on the whole it was the best thing he 
could have done. She consented to go with her maid 
to the hotel till Friday, and the party left for Washington that evening. 



XXIV 

THEY returned late on Friday night. As Betty had 
anticipated, Harriet's exhausted body had not harbored
