Explanations followed. H. was speedily transferred to their 
hotel, where they had bespoken rooms for us ; and we sallied 
forth to the court church to hear the music of high mass. 

This music is celebrated throughout Germany. It is, 
therefore, undoubtedly superior. The organ is noble, the 
opera company royal. But more perfect than all combined 
are the echoes of the church, which (though the guide book 
does not mention it) nullify every effect. 

Monday, 8. Visited the walks and gardens on the banks of 
the Elbe. The sky was clear, the weather glorious, and all 
nature full of joy. We almost think this Elbe another 
Seine ; these Bruhlsche gardens and terraces, these majestic 
old bridges, and cleft city, another Paris ! Here, too, is that 
out-of-doors life, life hi gardens, we admire so much. Break- 
fast in the public gardens ; hundreds of little groups sipping 
their coffee ! Dinner, tea, and supper in the gardens, with 
music of birds and bands ! 

Visited the Picture Gallery. If one were to chance upon 
an altar in tins German Athens inscribed to the "unknown 
god," he might be tempted to suggest that that deity's name 
is Decency. 

The human form is indeed divine, as M. Belloc insists, and 
rightly, sacredly drawn, cannot offend the purest eye. All 
nature is symbolic. The universe itself is a complex symbol 
of spiritual ideas. So in the structure and relation of the human body, some of the highest spiritual ideas, the divinest 
mysteries of pure worship, are designedly shadowed forth. 

If, then, the painter rightly and sacredly conceives the divine 
meaning, and creates upon the canvas, or in marble, forms of 
exalted ideal loveliness, we cannot murmur even if, like Adam 
and Eve in Eden, " they are naked, and are not ashamed." 
 



 



And yet even sacred tilings love mystery, and holiest emotions claim reserve. Nature herself seems to tell us that the 
more sacred some works of art might be, the less they should 
be unveiled. There are flowers that will wither in the sun. 
The passion of love, when developed according to the divine 
order, is, even in its physical relations, so holy that it cannot 
retain its delicacy under the sultry blaze of profane publicity. 

But it is far otherwise with paintings where the animus is 
not sacred, nor the meaning spiritual. No excellences of 
coloring, no marvels of foreshortening, no miracles of mechan- 
ism can consecrate the salacious images of mythologic abom- 
ination. 

The cheek that can forget to blush at the Venus and Cupid 
by Titian, at Leda and her Swan, at Jupiter and Io, and others 
of equally evil intent, ought never to pretend to blush at any 
tiling. Such pictures are a disgrace to the artists that painted, 
to the age that tolerates, and to the gallery that contains them. 
They are fit for a bagnio rather than a public exhibition. 

Evening. Dresden is the home of Madame Jenny Lind 
Goldschmidt. II. sent her card. This evening Mr. G. called 
to express regret that she was unable to see any one, on 
account of her recent confinement. He kindly offered us the 
use of his carriage and assistance in sightseeing. II. discussed 
with him the catalogues of the gallery of paintings. As to 
music, we learn, with regret, that it is out of season for concerts, oratorios, or any thing worth hearing. 

Wednesday, August 10. Dresden to Berlin. Drove to 
Charlottcnburg, and saw the monument of Queen Louisa. 

Thursday, 11. Visited the Picture Gallery, and various 
stores and shops. 

Saturday, August 13. Berlin to Wittenberg, two hours' 





ride. Examined the Schloss-Kirche, where Luther is buried, 
passing on our way through the public square containing his 
monument. 

At nine in the evening took cars for Erfurt. That night 
ride, with the moon and one star hanging beautifully over the 
horizon, was pleasant. There is a wild and thrilling excite- 
ment in thus plunging through the mysterious night in a land 
utterly unknown. Reached Erfurt at two in the morning. 

Monday, August 15. Erfurt to Eisenach by eight. Drove 
to the Wartburg. 







LETTER XLIII. 

Dresden. 

Dear : — 

I went to Dresden as an art-pilgrim, principally to see 
Raphael's great picture of the Madonna di San Sisto, supposing that to be the best specimen of his genius out of Italy. 
On my way I diligently studied the guide book of that indefatigable friend of the traveller, Mr. Murray, in which de- 
scriptions of the finest pictures are given, with the observations 
of artists ; so that inexperienced persons may know exactly 
what to think, and where to think it. My expectations had 
been so often disappointed, that my pulse was somewhat calm- 
er. Nevertheless, the glowing eulogiums of these celebrated 
artists could not but stimulate anticipation. We made our 
way, therefore, first to the salon devoted to the works of 
Raphael and Correggio, and soon found ourselves before the 
grand painting. Trembling with eagerness, I looked up. 
Was that the picture? W. whispered to me, "I think we 
have mistaken the painting." 

" No, we have not," said I, struggling to overcome the disappointment which I found creeping over me. The source 
of this disappointment was the thin and faded appearance of 
the coloring, which at first suggested to me the idea of a 
water-colored sketch. It had evidently suffered barbarously 
in tlie process of cleaning, a fact of which I had been fore- 
warned. This circumstance has a particularly unfavorable 
effect on a picture of Raphael's, because his coloring, at best, 



 



is delicate and reserved, and, as compared with that of Ru- 
bens, approaches to poverty ; so that he can ill afford to lose 
any thing in this way. 

Then as to conception and arrangement, there was much 
which annoyed me. The Virgin and Child in the centre are 
represented as rising in the air ; on one side below them is the 
kneeling figure of Pope Sixtus ; and on the other, that of St. 
Barbara. Now this Pope Sixtus is, in my eyes, a very home- 
ly old man, and as I think no better of homely old men for 
being popes, his presence in the picture is an annoyance. St. 
Barbara, on the other side, has the most beautiful head and 
face that could be represented ; but then she is kneeling on a 
cloud with such a judicious and coquettish arrangement of her 
neck, shoulders, and face, to show every fine point in them, as 
makes one feel that no saint (unless with a Parisian education) 
could ever have dropped into such a position in the abandon 
of holy rapture. In short, she looks like a theatrical actress ; 
without any sympathy with the solemnity of the religious con- 
ception, who is there merely because a beautiful woman was 
wanted to fill up the picture. 

Then that old, faded green curtain, which is painted as 
hanging down on either side of the picture, is, to my eye, a 
nuisance. The whole interest, therefore, of the piece concentrates in the centre figures, the Madonna and Child, and two 
angel children gazing up from the foot of the picture. These 
angel children were the first point on which my mind rested, 
in its struggle to overcome its disappointment, and bring itself 
en rapport with the artist. In order fully to appreciate their 
spiritual beauty, one must have seen an assortment of those 
things called angels, which occur in the works of the old masters. Generally speaking, I know of nothing more calculated 


 

to moderate any undue eagerness to go to heaven than the 
common run of canvas angels. Far the greater part are 
roistering, able-bodied fellows with wings, giving indisputable 
signs of good living, and of a coarseness slightly suggestive 
of blackguardism. Far otherwise with these fair creatures, 
with their rainbow-colored wings, and their serene, upturned 
eyes of thought baptized with emotion. They are the first 
things I have seen worthy of my ideas of Raphael. 

As to the Madonna, I think that, when Wilkie says she is 
" nearer the perfection of female elegance and grace than any 
thing in painting," he does not speak with discrimination. 
Mere physical beauty and grace are not the characteristics of 
the figure : many more perfect forms can be found, both on 
canvas and in marble. But the merits of the figure, to my 
mind, are, first, its historic accuracy in representing the dark- 
eyed Jewish maiden ; second, the wonderful fulness and depth 
of expression thrown into the face ; and third, the mysterious 
resemblance and sympathy between the face of the mother 
and that of the divine child. To my eye, this picture has precisely that which Murillo's Assumption in the Louvre wants : 
it has an unfathomable depth of earnestness. The Murillo 
is its superior in coloring and grace of arrangement. At first 
sight of the Murillo every one exclaims at once, " How beau- 
tiful ! " — at sight of this they are silent. Many are at first 
disappointed ; but the picture fastens the attention, and grows 
upon the thoughts ; while that of Murillo is dismissed with 
the words of admiration on the lips.
