'' You're quite sure her husband's living?" 

" Oh dear, yes."   

" Ah then ! " I 

" Ah then what ? "   

Strether had, after all, to think. " Well, I'm sorry for  
them." 

But it didn't matter, for the moment, more than that, 
He assured his young friend he was quite content. They   
wouldn't stir ; were all right as they were. He didn't   
want to be introduced ; had been introduced already H 
about as far as he could go. He had seen, moreover, an 
immensity ; liked Gloriani, who, as Miss Barrace kept 
saying, was wonderful ; had made out, he was sure, the 
half-dozen other men who were distinguished, the artists, 
the critics, and, oh, the great dramatist — lim it was easy to 
spot ; but wanted — no, thanks, really — to talk with none 
of them ; having nothmg at all to say and finding it would 
do beautifully as it was ; do beautifully because what it 
was — well, was just simply too late. And when, after this, 
little Bilham, submissive and responsive, but with an eye to 
the consolation nearest, easily threw off some " Better 
late than never ! " all he got in return for it was a sharp 
" Better early than late ! " This note, indeed, the next 
thing, overflowed, for Strether, into a quiet stream of 
demonstration that, as soon as he had let himself go, he 
felt as the real relief. It had consciously gathered to a   
head, but the reservoir had filled sooner than he knew, and 
his companion's touch was to make the waters spread. 
There were some things that had to come in time if they 
were to come at all. If they didn't come in time they ; 
were lost forever. It was the general sense of them that 
had overwhelmed him with its long, slow rush. 

" It's not too late for you on any side, and you don't 
strike me as in danger of missing the train ; besides which 
people can be in general pretty well trusted, of course — 
with the clock of their freedom ticking as loud as it seems 
to do here — to keep an eye on the fleeting hour. All the 
same, don't forget that you're young — blessedly young ; be 
glad of it, on the contrary, and live up to it. Live all you 
can ; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter 
what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. 
If you haven't had that, what have you had ? This place 
and these impressions — mild as you may find them to 
wind a man up so ; all my impressions of Chad and of 
people I've seen at his place — well, have had their abun- 
dant message for me, have just dropped that into my 
mind. I see it now. I haven't done so enough before — 
and now I'm old ; too old at any rate for what I see. Oh, 
I do see, at least ; and more than you'd believe or I can 
express. It's too late. And it's as if the train had fairly 
waited at the station for me without my having had the 
gumption to know it was there. Now I hear its faint, re- 
ceding whistle miles and miles down the line. What one 
loses one loses ; make no mistake about that. The affair — 
I mean the affair of life — couldn't, no doubt, have been 
different for me ; for it's at the best, a tin mould, either 
fluted and embossed, with ornamental excrescences, or else 
i smooth and dreadfully plain, into which, a helpless jelly, 
i one's consciousness is poured — s(T that one ' takes ' the 
form, as the great cook says, and is more or less compactly 
1 held by it : one lives, in fine, as one can. Still, one has 
the illusion of freedom ; therefore don't be, like me, 
1 without the memory of that illusion. I was either, at the 
I right time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it ; I don't 
quite know which. Of course, at present, I'm a case of 
reaction against the mistake ; and the voice of reaction 
should, no doubt, always be taken with an allowance. But 
that doesn't affect the point that the right time is now 
yours. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky 
as to have. You've plenty ; that's the great thing ; you're, 
as I say, damn you, so happily and hatefully young. 



Don't, at any rate, miss things out of stupidity. Of course 
I don't take you for a fool, or I shouldn't be addressing you 
thus awfully. Do what you like so long as you don't 
make my mistake. For it was a mistake. Live ! " . . . 
Slowly and sociably, with full pauses and straight dashes, 
Strether had so delivered himself; holding little Bilham, 
from step to step, deeply and gravely attentive. The end 
of all was that the young man had turned quite solemn, 
and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety 
the speaker had wished to promote. He watched for a 
moment the consequence of his words, and then, laying a 
hand on his listener's knee and as if to end, properly, with 
a joke : " And now for the eye I shall keep on you ! " 

" Oh, but I don't know that I want to be, at your age, 
too different from you !" 

" Ah, prepare, while you're about it," Strether said, " to 
be more amusing." 

Little Bilham continued to think ; then at last he had a 
smile. " Well, you at-e amusing — to meP 

" Impayable, as you say, no doubt. But what am I to my- 
self? " Strether had risen with this, giving his attention now 
to an encounter that, in the middle of the garden, was in the 
act of taking place between their host and the lady at whose 
side Mme. de Vionnet had quitted him. This lady, who 
appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends, 
awaited Gloriani's eager approach with words on her lips 
that Strether couldn't catch, but of which her interesting, 
witty face seemed to give him the echo. He was sure she 
was prompt and fine, but also that she had met her match, 
and. he liked — in the light of what he was quite sure was 
the Duchess's latent insolence— the good humour with 
which the great artist asserted equal resources. Were 
they, this pair, of the " great world " .- — and was he himself, 
for the moment, thus related to them by his observation, 
in it? Then there was something in the great world 
covertly tigerish, which came to him, across the lawn, in 
the charming air, as a waft from the jungle. Yet it made 
him admire most of the two, made him envy, the glossy 
male tiger, magnificently marked. These absurdities of 
the stirred sense, fruits of suggestion, ripening on the 
instant, were all reflected in his next words to little Bilhank" 





" I know — if we talk of that — whom I should enjoy being 
like!" 

Little Bilham followed his eyes ; but then, as if with a 
shade of knowing surprise : " Gloriani ? " 

Our friend had in fact already hesitated, though not on 
the hint of his companion's doubt, in which there were 
depths of critical reserve. He had just made out, in the 
now full picture, something and somebody else ; another 
impression had been superimposed. A young girl in a 
white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly 
come into view, and what was next clear was that her 
course was toward them. What was clearer still was that 
the handsome young man at her side was Chad Newsome, 
and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore 
Mile, de Vionnet, that she was unmistakably pretty — bright, 
gentle, shy, happy, wonderful — and that Chad now, with a 
consummate calculation of effect, was about to present her 
to his old friend's vision. What was clearest of all indeed 
was something much more than this, something at the 
single stroke of which — and wasn't it simply juxtaposition? 
— all vagueness vanished. It was the click of a spring — 
he saw the truth. He had by this time also met Chad's 
look ; there was more of it in that ; and the truth, accord- 
ingly, so far as Bilham's inquiry was concerned, had thrust 
in the answer. "Oh, Chad!" — it was that rare youth he 
should have enjoyed being " like." The virtuous attach- 
ment would be all there before him ; the virtuous attachment 
would be in the very act of appeal for his blessing ; Jeanne 
de Vionnet, this charming creature, would be — exquisitely, 
intensely now — the object of it. Chad brought her straight 
up to him, and Chad was, oh yes, at this moment — for the 
glory of Woollett or whatever — better still even than 
Gloriani. He had plucked this blossom ; he had kept it, 
overnight, in water ; and at last, as he held it up to wonder, 
he did enjoy his effect. That was why Strether had felt at 
first the breath of calculation — and why, moreover, as he 
now knew, his look at the girl would be, for the young 
man, a sign of the latter's success. What young man had 
ever paraded about that way, without a reason, a maiden 
in her flower? And there was nothing in his reason at 
present obscure. Her type sufficiently told of it — they 




wouldn't want her to go to Woollett. Poor WooUett, and 
what it might miss ? — though brave Chad indeed, too, and 
what it might gain ! Brave Chad, however, had just ex- 
cellently spoken. " This is a good little friend of mine 
who knows all about you, and has, moreover, a message for 
you. And this, my dear " — he had turned to the child her- 
self — " is the best man in the world, who has it in his power 
to do a great deal for us, and whom I want you to like and 
revere as nearly as possible as much as I do." 

She stood there quite pink, a little frightened, prettier 
and prettier and not a bit like her mother. There was in 
this last particular no resemblance but that of youth to 
youth ; and here in fact, suddenly, was Strether's sharpest 
impression. It went wondering, dazed, embarrassed, back 
to the woman he had just been talking with ; it was a 
revelation in the light of which he already saw she would 
become more interesting. So slim and fresh and fair, she 
had yet put forth this perfection ; so that for really believ- 
ing it of her, for seeing her to any such developed degree 
as a mother, comparison would be urgent. Well, what 
was it now but fairly thrust upon him ? " Mamma wishes 
me to tell you before we go," the girl said, " that she hopes
