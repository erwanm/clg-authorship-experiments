the thing in itself ho was attached. This was Miriam's case, 
but the contrast, which she showed him she also felt, was in 
the number of other things that she got with the thing in 
itself. 

I hasten to add that our young man had hours when this 
fine substance struck him as requiring, for a complete appeal, 
no adjunct whatever as being in its own splendour a sum- 
mary of all adjuncts and apologies. I have related that the 
great collections, the National Gallery and the Museum were 
sometimes rather a series of dead surfaces to him ; but the 
sketch I have attempted of him will have been inadequate if 
it fails to suggest that there were other days when, as he 
strolled through them, he plucked right and left perfect nose- 
gays of reassurance. Bent as he was on working in the 
modern, which spoke to him with a thousand voices, he judged 
it better, for long periods, not to haunt the earlier masters, 
whose conditions had been so different (later he came to see 
that it didn't matter much, especially if one didn't go) ; but 
he was liable to accidental deflections from this theory liable 
in particular to want to take a look at one of the r great 
portraits of the past. These were the things that were the 
most inspiring, in the sense that they were the things that, 
while generations, while worlds had come and gone, seemed 
most to survive and testify. As he stood before them some- 
times the perfection of their survival struck him as the 
supreme eloquence, the reason that included all others, thanks 
to the language of art, the richest and most universal. Em- 
pires and systems and conquests had rolled over the globe and 
every kind of greatness had risen and passed away ; but the 
beauty of the great pictures had known nothing of death or 
change, and the ages had only sweetened their freshness. 
The same faces, the same figures looked out at different cen- 
turies, knowing a deal the century didn't, and when they 
joined hands they made the indestructible thread on which 
the pearls of history were strung. 

Miriam notified her artist that her theatre was to close on 
the 10th of August, immediately after which she was to start, 





with the company, on a tremendous tour of the provinces. 
They were to make a lot of money, but they were to have no 
holiday and she didn't want one ; she only wanted to keep at 
it and make the most of her limited opportunities for practice ; 
inasmuch as, at that rate, playing but two parts a year (and 
such parts she despised them !) she shouldn't have mastered 
the rudiments of her trade before decrepitude would compel 
her to lay it by. The first time she came to the studio after 
her visit with Dashwood she sprang up abruptly, at the end 
of half an hour, saying she could sit no more she had had 
enough of it. She was visibly restless and preoccupied, and 
though Nick had not waited till now to discover that she had 
more moods than he had tints on his palette, he had never yet 
seen her fitfulness at this particular angle. It was a trifle 
unbecoming and he was ready to let her go. She looked 
round the place as if she were suddenly tired of it, and then 
she said mechanically, in a heartless London way, while she 
smoothed down her gloves : " So you're just going to stay on ? " 
After he had confessed that this was his dark purpose she 
continued in the same casual, talk-making manner : " I dare 
say it's the best thing for you. You're just going to grind, eh ? " 

" I see before me an eternity of grinding." 

"All alone, by yourself, in this dull little hole? You will 
be conscientious, you will be virtuous." 

" Oh, my solitude will be mitigated I shall have models 
and people." 

"What people what models'?" Miriam asked, before the 
glass, arranging her hat. 

" Well, no one so good as you." 

"That's a prospect ! " the girl laughed ; "for all the good 
you've got out of me ! " 

" You're no judge of that quantity," said Nick, " and even 
I can't measure it just yet. Have I been rather a brute ? I 
can easily believe it ; I haven't talked to you I haven't 
amused you as I might. The truth is, painting people is a 
very absorbing, exclusive occupation. You can't do much to 
them besides." 

" Yes, it's a cruel honour." 

" Cruel that's too much," Nick objected. 

"I mean it's one you shouldn't confer on people you like, 
for when it's over it's over : it kills your interest in them and 
after you've finished them you don't like them any more." 

" Surely I like you," Nick returned, sitting tilted back, 
before his picture, with his hands in his pockets. 





" We've done very well : it's something not to have 
quarrelled," said Miriam, smiling at him now and seeming 
more in it. " I wouldn't have had you slight your work I 
wouldn't have had you do it badly. But there's no fear of 
that for you," she went on. " You're the real thing and the 
rare bird. I haven't lived with you this way without seeing 
that : you're the sincere artist so much more than I. No, no, 
don't protest," she added, with one of her sudden fine tran- 
sitions to a deeper tone. " You'll do things that will hand on 
your name when my screeching is happily over. Only you do 
seem to me, I confess, rather high and dry here I speak from 
the point of view of your comfort and of my personal interest 
in you. You strike me as kind of lonely, as the Americans 
say rather cut off and isolated in your grandeur. Haven't 
you any confreres fellow-artists and people of that sort ? 
Don't they come near you? " 

" I don't know them much, I've always been afraid of them, 
and how can they take me seriously ? " 

" Well, I've got confreres, and sometimes I wish I hadn't ! 
But does your sister never come near you any more, or is it 
only the fear of meeting me ? " 

Nick was aware that his mother had a theory that Biddy 
was constantly bundled home from Rosedale Road at the ap- 
proach of improper persons : she was as angry at this as if 
she wouldn't have been more so if the child had been suffered 
to stay ; but the explanation he gave his present visitor was 
nearer the truth. He reminded Miriam that he had already 
told her (he had been careful to do this, so as not to let it 
appear she was avoided) that her sister was now most of the 
time in the country, staying with an hospitable relation. 

"Oh yes," the girl rejoined to this, "with Mr. Sherringham's 

sister, Mrs. what's her name ? I always forget it." 

And when Nick had pronounced the word with a reluctance he 
doubtless failed sufficiently to conceal (he hated to talk about 
Mrs. Dallow ; he didn't know what business Miriam had with 
her), she exclaimed : " That's the one the beauty, the wonder- 
ful beauty. I shall never forget how handsome she looked 
the day she found me here. I don't in the least resemble 
her, but I should like to have a try at that type, some day, in 
a comedy of manners. But who will write me a comedy of 
manners ] There it is ! The trouble would be, no doubt, 
that I should push her a la, charge." 

Nick listened to these remarks in silence, saying to himself 
that if Miriam should have the bad taste (she seemed trembling 





on the brink of it) to make an allusion to what had passed 
between the lady in question and himself, he should dislike 
her utterly. It would show him she was a coarse creature 
after all. Her good genius interposed however, as against 
this hard penalty, and she quickly, for the moment at least, 
whisked away from the topic, demanding, apropos of comrades 
and visitors, what had become of Gabriel Nash, whom she had 
not encountered for so many days. 

" I think he's tired of me," said Nick ; " he hasn't been 
near me, either. But, after all, it's natural he has seen me 
through." 

" Seen you through ? Why, you've only just begun." 

" Precisely, and at bottom he doesn't like to see me begin. 
He's afraid I'll do something." 

" Do you mean he's jealous ? " 

" Not in the least, for from the moment one does anything 
one ceases to compete with him. It leaves him the field more 
clear. But that's just the discomfort, for him he feels, as you 
said just now, kind of lonely ; he feels rather abandoned and 
even, I think, a little betrayed. So far from being jealous he 
yearns for me and regrets me. The only thing he really -takes 
seriously is to speculate and understand, to talk about the 
reasons and the essence of things : the people who do that are 
the highest. The applications, the consequences, the vulgar 
little effects belong to a lower plane, to which one must doubt- 
less be tolerant and indulgent, but which is after all an affair 
of comparative accidents and trifles. Indeed he'll probably 
tell me frankly, the next time I see him, that he can't but feel 
that to come down to the little questions of action the little 
prudences and compromises and simplifications of practice is 
for the superior person a really fatal descent. One may be 
inoffensive and even commendable after it, but one can scarcely 
pretend to be interesting. II enfant comme qa, but one doesn't 
haunt them. He'll do his best for me ; he'll come back again, 
but he'll come back sad, and finally he'll fade away altogether.
