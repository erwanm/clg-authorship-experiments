useless; I know; I don't imagine, I don't forestall, I don't predict.
I am not discounting any hopes of mine, because, Phil, I had not
thought--had not planned such a thing--between you and Eileen--I don't
know why. But I had not; there was Suddy Gray--a nice boy, perfectly
qualified; and there were alternates more worldly, perhaps. But I did
not think of you; and that is what now amazes and humiliates me; because
it was the obvious that I overlooked--the most perfectly natural--"

"Nina! you are madder than a March heiress!"

"Air your theories, Phil, then come back to realities. The conditions
remain; Eileen is certainly a little in love with you; and a little with
her means something. And you, evidently, have never harboured any
serious intentions toward the child; I can see that, because you are the
most transparent man I ever knew. Now, the question is, what is to be
done?"

"Done? Good heavens! Nothing, of course! There's nothing to do anything
about! Nina, you are the most credulous little matchmaker that ever--"

"Oh, Phil, must I listen to all those fulminations before you come
down to the plain fact? And it's plain to me as the nose on your
countenance; and I don't know what to do about it! I certainly was a
perfect fool to confide in you, for you are exhibiting the coolness and
sagacity of a stampeded chicken."

He laughed in spite of himself; then, realising a little what her
confidence had meant, he turned a richer red and slowly lifted his
fingers to his moustache, while his perplexed gray eyes began to narrow
as though sun-dazzled.

"I am, of course, obliged to believe that you are mistaken," he said; "a
man cannot choose but believe in that manner. . . . There is no very
young girl--nobody, old or young, whom I like as thoroughly as I do
Eileen Erroll. She knows it; so do you, Nina. It is open and
above-board. . . . I should be very unhappy if anything marred or
distorted our friendship. . . . I am quite confident that nothing will."

"In that frame of mind," said his sister, smiling, "you are the
healthiest companion in the world for her, for you will either cure her,
or she you; and it is all right either way."

"Certainly it will be all right," he said confidently.

For a few moments he paced the room, reflective, quickening his pace all
the while; and his sister watched him, silent in her indecision.

"I'm going up to see the kids," he said abruptly.

The children, one and all, were in the Park; but Eileen was sewing in
the nursery, and his sister did not call him back as he swung out of the
room and up the stairs. But when he had disappeared, Nina dropped into
her chair, aware that she had played her best card prematurely; forced
by Rosamund, who had just told her that rumour continued to be very busy
coupling her brother's name with the name of the woman who once had been
his wife.

Nina was now thoroughly convinced of Alixe's unusual capacity for making
mischief.

She had known Alixe always--and she had seen her develop from a
talented, restless, erratic, emotional girl, easily moved to generosity,
into an impulsive woman, reckless to the point of ruthlessness when
ennui and unhappiness stampeded her; a woman not deliberately selfish,
not wittingly immoral, for she lacked the passion which her emotion was
sometimes mistaken for; and she was kind by instinct.

Sufficiently intelligent to suffer from the lack of it in others,
cultured to the point of recognising culture, her dangerous unsoundness
lay in her utter lack of mental stamina when conditions became
unpleasant beyond her will, not her ability to endure them.

The consequences of her own errors she refused to be burdened with; to
escape somehow, was her paramount impulse, and she always tried to--had
always attempted it even in school-days--and farther back when Nina
first remembered her as a thin, eager, restless little girl scampering
from one scrape into another at full speed. Even in those days there
were moments when Nina believed her to be actually irrational, but there
was every reason not to say so to the heedless scatterbrain whose
father, in the prime of life, sat all day in his room, his faded eyes
fixed wistfully on the childish toys which his attendant brought to him
from his daughter's nursery.

All this Nina was remembering; and again she wondered bitterly at
Alixe's treatment of her brother, and what explanation there could ever
be for it--except one.

Lately, too, Alixe had scarcely been at pains to conceal her contempt
for her husband, if what Rosamund related was true. It was only one more
headlong scrape, this second marriage, and Nina knew Alixe well enough
to expect the usual stampede toward that gay phantom which was always
beckoning onward to promised happiness--that goal of heart's desire
already lying so far behind her--and farther still for every step her
little flying feet were taking in the oldest, the vainest, the most
hopeless chase in the world--the headlong hunt for happiness.

And if that blind hunt should lead once more toward Selwyn? Suppose,
freed from Ruthven, she turned in her tracks and threw herself and her
youthful unhappiness straight at the man who had not yet destroyed the
picture that Nina found when she visited her brother's rooms with the
desire to be good to him with rocking-chairs!

Not that she really believed or feared that Philip would consider such
an impossible reconciliation; pride, and a sense of the absurd, must
always check any such weird caprice of her brother's conscience; and
yet--and yet other amazing and mismated couples had done it--had been
reunited.

And Nina was mightily troubled, for Alixe's capacity for mischief was
boundless; and that she, in some manner, had already succeeded in
stirring up Philip, was a rumour that persisted and would not be
annihilated.

To inform a man frankly that a young girl is a little in love with him
is one of the oldest, simplest, and easiest methods of interesting that
man--unless he happen to be in love with somebody else. And Nina had
taken her chances that the picture of Alixe was already too unimportant
for the ceremony of incineration. Besides, what she had ventured to say
to him was her belief; the child appeared to be utterly absorbed in her
increasing intimacy with Selwyn. She talked of little else; her theme
was Selwyn--his influence on Gerald, and her delight in his
companionship. They had, at his suggestion, taken up together the study
of Cretan antiquities--a sort of tender pilgrimage for her, because,
with the aid of her father's and mother's letters, note-books, and
papers, she and Selwyn were following on the map the journeys and
discoveries of her father.

But this was not all; Nina's watchful eyes opened wider and wider as she
witnessed in Eileen the naissance of an unconscious and delicate
coquetry, quite unabashed, yet the more significant for that; and Nina,
intent on the new phenomena, began to divine more about Eileen in a
single second, than the girl could have suspected of herself in a month
of introspection and of prayer.

Love was not there; Nina understood that; but its germ was--still
dormant, but bedded deliciously in congenial soil--the living germ in
all its latent promise, ready to swell with the first sudden heart-beat,
quicken with the first quickening of the pulse, unfold into perfect
symmetry if ever the warm, even current in the veins grew swift and hot
under the first scorching whisper of Truth.

       

Eileen, sewing by the nursery window, looked up; her little Alsatian
maid, cross-legged on the floor at her feet, sewing away diligently,
also looked up, then scrambled to her feet as Selwyn halted on the
threshold of the room.

"Why, how odd you look!" said Eileen, laughing: "come in, please;
Susanne and I are only mending some of my summer things. Were you in
search of the children?--don't say so if you were, because I'm quite
happy in believing that you knew I was here. Did you?"

"Where are the children?" he asked.

"In the Park, my very rude friend. You will find them on the Mall if you
start at once."

He hesitated, but finally seated himself, omitting the little formal
hand-shake with which they always met, even after an hour's separation.
Of course she noticed this, and, bending low above her sewing, wondered
why.

It seemed to him, for a moment, as though he were looking at a woman he
had heard about and had just met for the first time. His observation of
her now was leisurely, calm, and thorough--not so calm, however, when,
impatient of his reticence, bending there over her work, she raised her
dark-blue eyes to his, her head remaining lowered. The sweet, silent
inspection lasted but a moment, then she resumed her stitches, aware
that something in him had changed since she last had seen him; but she
merely smiled quietly to herself, confident of his unaltered devotion in
spite of the strangely hard and unresponsive gaze that had uneasily
evaded hers.

As her white fingers flew with the glimmering needle she reflected on
conditions as she had left them a week ago. A week ago, between him and
her the most perfect of understandings existed; and the consciousness of
it she had carried with her every moment in the country--amid the icy
tumble of the surf, on long vigorous walks over the greening hills where
wild moorland winds whipped like a million fairy switches till the young
blood fairly sang, pouring through her veins.

Since that--some time within the week, something evidently had
happened to him, here in the city while she had been away. What?

As she bent above the fine linen garment on her knee, needle flying, a
sudden memory stirred coldly--the recollection of her ride with
Rosamund; and instinctively her clear eyes flew open and she raised her
head, turning directly toward him a disturbed gaze he did not this time
evade.

In silence their regard lingered; then, satisfied, she smiled again,
saying: "Have I been away so long that we must begin all over, Captain
Selwyn?"

"Begin what, Eileen?"

"To remember that the silence of selfish preoccupation is a privilege I
have not accorded you?"
