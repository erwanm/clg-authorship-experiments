" It is the hour of siesta," he said. " Let 



 

us lie in these hammocks and wait. Ay ! 
but it is warm, and the sky is blue, and 
the sun looks like the copper lamp of my 
mother the one that came from Boston. 
Who even an Indian would live in 
the mountains when the valleys are so big 
and warm ? " 

They extended themselves in two ham 
mocks swung across the corridor and 
watched the many doors on the several 
sides of the court. All were closed, and 
the forest had hardly been more quiet than 
the Casa Carillo in its hour of siesta. 
Through the arch of the gateway they 
could see the green of fields, a corner of a 
vineyard, and rolling hills. On either side 
of the entrance was a large magnolia-tree 
with broad shining leaves and bunches of 
cream-white fragrance. The oranges were 

 

very yellow, the palms very stately, the 
red tiles on the sloping roofs above the 
white walls looked very fresh and red. 
There was colour and beauty everywhere ; 
and the boys were quite at peace, and con 
tent to be so. Their appetite for 
adventure was dulled for the moment.

ADO OR on the opposite corridor 
opened and a youth came forth. 
He jerked his head diffidently at the 
guests and took the longest way round 
instead of crossing the court ; but when he 
reached the boys, who were risen and 
awaiting him, he wore a dignified air of 
welcome, as befitted a young gentleman 
of his race. 

" Welcome to Casa Carillo, senors," he 
said gravely. " The house is yours. Burn 
it if you will. I, myself, Rafael Carillo, am 
your slave." 

To which Roldan replied : " We are at 
your feet, for you and yours have rescued 
us from death and given us food and cloth 
ing when we most needed it. Our lives 
are yours to do with as you wish." 

" Then would we keep you here always, 
Don Roldan and Don Adan. All guests 



 

are welcome at Casa Carillo, but doubly 
those that need it." 

Then, formalities over, as boys are 
pretty much alike the world round, Rafael 
was soon pouring forth eager questions, 
and our heroes were reliving the events of 
the past weeks. Arm in arm they strolled 
out into the wide beautiful valley, green 
with sprouting winter, the distant moun 
tains of terrible memory quivering under 
a dark blue mist. 

"Hist!" said Rafael, suddenly. "Do 
you know what day this is ? " 

" Day ? " The adventurers had lost all 
count of time. 

" It is the day before Christmas, my 
friends." 

" No ! Madre de dios ! " Roldan and 
Adan stood still. For a moment they felt 
homesick. They saw the reproachful faces 
of their parents and brothers and sisters, to 
say npthing of visions of unclaimed pres 
ents. But Rafael gave them no time for 
regrets. He was the only child at home, 
and delighted with his new companions. 

" To-morrow many people will come, " 



 

he said. " I have ten married sisters and 
brothers. They all come from their 
ranchos, and many more. It will be very 
gay, my friends." 

" Good," said Rolclan, dismissing regret. 
" We will enjoy." 

" And after Christmas is gone I know 
of something else," said Rafael, myste 
riously. He glanced about. They stood 
in the midst of a great vineyard, each en 
gaged upon a large purple bunch. " Come," 
said Rafael, with an air of mystery. " Not 
here. Some one may hide beneath the 



vines." 



It was extremely unlikely, but the ad 
venturers liked the suggestion and followed 
their host breathlessly into the open field. 
" One day in the summer," whispered 
Rafael, his eyes rolling about, " I went with 
four vaqueros with a present of venison to 
Father Osuna. He was not at the Mis 
sion, and a brother told us that he walked 
among the hills. I thought I would go to 
meet him and receive his blessing. For a 
time I saw no one, and I thought, Ca- 
ramba! but the padre has long legs this 



 

hot weather! Just then he stood before 
me. He had walked out of the side of the 
hill through a hole no wider than himself. 
He sweated like a bull after collar, and his 
cassock was gathered in his two hands, 
leaving his bare shanks no more sacred 
than an Indian's. He did not look like a 
priest at all, and I forgot to kneel to him, 
but stared with my mouth open. And 
what do you think he did, my friends ? 
He turned white like the hand of a doiia 
in her teens and and dropped his cas 
sock. And " 

"Well? well?" 

"What do you think rolled to the 
ground, my friends? Chunks of yellow 
stuff that glittered, and a shower of spark 
ling yellow sand beautiful as sunshine 
on the floor. I gave a cry and ran to pick 
it up. I had never seen anything so beau 
tiful, I never had wanted anything so 
much. I felt that I would die for it in 
that moment, my friends. But that priest, 
what do you think he did? He gave a 
yell of rage, as if he could tear me in 
pieces, and flung himself all over that 
sunshine of earth. My gold ! he cried. 
 Mine ! mine ! You shall not take it from 
me! If it is yours it is not mine, my 
father," I said, feeling ashamed, though 
I still wanted it; I will help you to pick 
it up. He got up then, his face very red 
again, and I could see that he was trying 
to put on his dignity as fast as he had put 
down his cassock he looked better with 
both in place. My son, he said, * the day 
is warm and I am very tired, and, I fear, a 
little ill. These rocks are nothing. They 
please my eye, and I pick them up some 
times as I walk among the hills. Leave 
them there. I do not want them. We 
will return to the Mission. If you do 
not want them, then may I have them ? I 
asked the blood flew all over my body, 
my friends. He scowled as if I had asked 
him for the candles on the altar. No, 
he said, you cannot. Then he put his 
big hand on my shoulder he could twist 
your neck in a minute with those hands 
Listen to me, my son, he said, very soft, 
and looking so kind now, you can't think. 
"There is poison in those stones, pretty as
