board," replied the merchant, willing to secure a purchaser. 

He referred to his books for the desired information. 
The watch was brought to the store on the twentieth of 
January by a gentleman who professed to dispose of it on 




behalf of another but, beyond this, Aleck could learn 
nothing. The clerk who had concluded the bargain was 
out, and none of the other employes retained any recollection of the customer's appearance or name. Stipulating 
that he should have the refusal of the watch until a certain 
hour in the afternoon, Aleck left the shop and went to transact some business at the bank where his account had been 
kept ever since he reached his majority. 

He was personally well known to the officials there, and 
the cashier, while paying over the amount he wished to 
draw, observed : " By-the-way, Mr. Lay, I hope your 
brother has no cause of dissatisfaction with us. His deposits 
have usually been heavy, and his drafts so infrequent as to 
leave a large amount always to his credit. But, one day, 
about the middle of January, he surprised us by drawing 
upon us for every cent he had in our hands for more, in fact, 
as he has learned from the statement of account we forwarded 
to him by mail. He overchecked, inadvertently, to the 
amount of five hundred dollars." 

"Impossible!" ejaculated Aleck. "Who presented the 
drafts?" 

" A neighbor of yours, I think Colonel Floyd." 

"What!" 

"Unless I was mistaken that was the name by which 
your brother's letter introduced him," answered the bank 
officer, in some surprise. "I kept it as a voucher, although 
the bearer came to us in company with a well-known and 
highly respectable citizen." 

" I should like to see both letter and draft, if you please !" 
requested Aleck, recovering himself. 

They were quickly produced. The note was brief, and 
dated December 24th ; and it, as well as the drafts, bore 
Robert's signature. 

" The genuineness of which I deny !" said Aleck to the 





alarmed cashier. " In the first place, I do not believe that 
my brother would have taken a step so singular and import 
ant without consulting me ; in the second, I happen to know 
that Colonel Floyd would not be the individual likely to be 
intrusted with this business. Mr. Robert Lay is not at 
home just now, and I ask you, as a favor, to let the matter 
rest until I can privately investigate it." 

The promise was willingly given, and the perturbed 
Aleck directed his steps again to the jewellers, more anxious 
than ever to obtain possession of the watch, and unriddle 
the mystery of its present ownership. 

The head clerk was in the store this time, a sharp, quick 
Yankee, whose wits were always on the alert, and who was, 
in this case, disposed to be very communicative. He recollected perfectly the incident of the watch being offered for 
sale, and the physiognomy, form, etc., of the man who 
brought it to the establishment. His attention was particularly drawn to these by the oddity of the proposed negotiation on the part of a gentleman so imposing in demeanor, 
and stylish in apparel. He could tell more ; for chancing, on 
the day after the purchase, to enter the office of a certain 
fashionable hotel, he had seen the same person sitting there, 
smoking in company with a party of acquaintances had in 
quired his name, and learned that it was Floyd. 

With the watch safe in his pocket, Aleck thanked the 
obliging salesman, and hurried off to follow up another clue 
to the truth of the dark surmise he yet entertained vaguely 
almost blindly. This was an inspection of the hotel register 
of January 20th. He found upon the record of the 18th 
Colonel Floyd's name, written in his dashing hand. He had 
been in the city at that date then, although Aleck had never 
heard of the visit until now. He it was, beyond a question, 
who had presented the false checks, if false they were, and 
sold the watch. Could he be acting as Robert's agent ? accredited, yet secret ? If this were so, there was deep villany 
somewhere ; if not, imagination recoiled at the black abyss 
of crime unveiled by the doubt. Still undergoing the torments of indecision and never-still suspicions, he set out 
upon his return journey. 

The nearest depot to Maple Hill was Hock's Tavern, to 
which place Robert's farewell letter to his brother had directed him to send for his horse. Hero had been found ! 
there, securely stabled, and had now occupied his old stall 
at Greenfield for many weeks ; but motives of delicacy, that 
principal of which was to shield Robert from public remark, 
had deterred" Aleck from making any inquiries as to who 
had left the animal in the hostler's care. Dismissing these 
now as absurd, where issues so momentous were involved, 
he, upon his arrival at the tavern, made it his business to 
search out the negro who had charge of the stables, and 
recalling to his mind the circumstance and the time of its 
occurrence, asked whether he had himself seen Mr. Robert 
Lay while he waited at the house for the afternoon train. 
The fellow professed to recollect every thing connected with 
the matter, and was positive in declaring that the horse had 
not been brought to the stable until two hours after the cars 
had passed, and when it was already dark ; that his rider 
was a negro of gruif speech and few words, who represent 
ed that he had been ordered to leave the horse in his, the 
hostler's, keeping, until Mr. Alexander Lay, of Maple Hill, 
should send for him, and forthwith departed upon foot. He 
would be loath, he subjoined, hesitatingly, to get an inno 
cent person into mischief, but one of the stable-boys had 
recognized the horseman by flashing a lantern into his face 
as he was leaving the yard. He was, the groom was certain, 
a free colored man of questionable character, who lived 
about five miles away. 

Aleck diverged from his road on the way home, to call at 





his fellow's abode a mean cabin, situated in a pine grove 

about midway between Colonel Floyd's plantation and the 

lepot, a sequestered, ill-looking spot, fit to be the scene of 

deeds that shunned the light. The owner of this choice 

Habitation was absent, but his wife appeared at the door 

vhen the carriage stopped, and manifested signs of extreme 

trepidation at beholding the visitor. . Alighting with a sefere, determined countenance, Mr. Lay called her aside, and 

oldly proclaimed his knowledge of her husband's errand to 

the tavern on Christmas night a job that would get him 

hto trouble unless he could show that he came honestly by 

jhe horse, or confessed who had commissioned him to per- 

prm the act. The woman hung back for a time. She knew 

othing of the matter ; she had not seen the animal ; she 

as away from home all Christmas week, and a dozen lies 

ore, which Aleck upset as fast as she brought them forward. 

At last, as he was turning off with the warning that she 
ud her accomplices might shortly find themselves before a 
ibunal where means would be devised to extort the truth, 
be burst into tears, and offered to reveal all she knew, pro- 
ded he would not betray her to her husband. A horse 
ad been brought to their house about three o'clock on 
hristmas day, by Booker, Colonel Floyd's head man. She 
ad peeped at him through the window as he talked in the 
ard with Jeff, her husband, had seen him hand Jeff a bank 
ote, and that the latter led the horse to the rude hut they 
Jled a barn, and shut him in, locking the door and pocket- 
g the key. She did not dare to ask questions, or indeed 
 mention what she had witnessed, unless Jeff should volunteer an allusion to the affair. He made but one remark that 
ould have any bearing upon the subject, and that was at 
night-fall, just after he had despatched his supper. 
"I shan't be home until near midnight," he had said, 




you and I've got one word to say before I start. Whatever 
you've seen to-day, or may hear to-night, hold your tongue, 
or you'll suffer for it." 

With that he went out, and she distinctly heard the 
tramping of hoofs soon afterwards. 

" While anxiety and suspense were wrought to the high 
est pitch by my endeavors to shape a reasonable theory out 
of all this," continued Aleck, " I reached home, and the first 
object I beheld was Colonel Floyd's carriage, with Booker 
standing by it ; heard from you that he himself was waiting 
to see me. His ostensible business was to ask me to fix a 
day for the settlement of his guardianship accounts. He 
offered the intelligence that he could hand over immediately 
that portion of your estate which was in ready money, and 
also render satisfactory statements of sales of property ; the 
yearly crops and servants hire ; sums disbursed for your 
expenses ; and a great deal more plausible talk, to which I 
lent only half an ear. As adroitly as I could in my unsettled 
state, I forced him to speak of his liabilities to Robert, the 
proofs of which I told him my brother had showed me in a 
couple of bonds, executed and signed by Colonel Floyd, covering an amount of nine hundred dollars. Accomplished 
villain as I knew him to be, I was yet thunderstruck when
