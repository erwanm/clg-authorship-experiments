you will play me false?" 

" My good friend, I should expect, in that case, to 
become your victim. However, your request is reason- 


 

able. You shall have one third of the sum stipulated in 
advance. 

He placed twenty dollars in the hands of his compan- 
ion, and, rising, paid his score. He then betook him- 
self to the ship, and, on the arrival of Captain Brace, 
acquainted him with the result of his visit. The latter 
expressed great satisfaction. 

Meanwhile BiU Sturdy and Charlie were speaking of 
the plan they had in view, â€” that of escaping from the 
ship. 

" Suppose," said Charlie, " we cannot!' obtain permis- 
sion to go on shore together." 

" Then I will come to the wharf at midnight, and you 
can leave your bunk unobserved and join me." 



 



XXX. 

THE PASS OF DEATH. 

" Hate I permission to go on shore, Captain Brace?   
inquired Bill Sturdy on the following morning. 

" I shall Tequire your services on board during the 
day," said the captain, acting in accordance with the suggestion and arrangements of the mate.    At nightfall 
you can go if you like." 

Charlie, lemming from Bill Sturdy, the result of his 
application, did not prefer a request till evening. This 
request was unceremoniously refhsed. The captain had 
no desire that our young hero should be present at the 
assault .upon Bill, as his presence might prevent the attack being made, and its success, in consequence of 
Sturdy's great strength, depended on its unexpectedness. 

"Never mind," said Bill, in a low voice, " wait till 
midnight. Meanwhile I will be seeking out a proper 
place of concealment. When the Cathedral clock strikes 
midnight, rise quietly and take a bundle of clothes, if 
you can do it unobserved, and jump upon the wharf. I 
will be waiting for you." 

Cheered by this hope, Charlie was content to wait. 

He went below, and opening his chest, put together 



in a bundle the clothes which he had on when he went 
on board the vessel for the first time. His little prepaiv 
ation having now been made, he sat. down and com- 
menced a letter to his mother which it was his purpose 
to mail in the city, to be completed when the result of 
his attempt to escape should be known. 

We must now follow the movements of the villain with 
whom Randall had conferred. He had no idea of failing 
to carry out his part of the contract. Aside from the 
pecuniary inducement, his savage temper and utter want 
of principle, made him rather court such adventures, 
even for their own sake. Just before nightfall he stationed himself at a point on the wharf where he would 
have an opportunity of observing all that went on board 
the vessel. 

With his keen eyes he scrutinized the forms of the 
sailors with a view of verifying Randall's description, 
and so picking out the one who was destined to be his 
victim. Circumstances conspired to lead him to a wrong 
conclusion upon this point. 

Bill Sturdy was, at that time, below, making preparations to go on shore. It has already been remarked, 
that previous to his enrolment among the crew, Antonio 
had been, physically, the most powerful among them. 
Although inferior to Bill Sturdy, yet he possessed a formidable amount of strength, and on board most vessels 
might have challenged comparison with any. But if 
Antonio was one in a hundred. Sturdy was one in a 
thousand. Seldom, very seldom, is there concentrated 
in the human frame so much power as he possessed. 
He would not have been found unequal to the feats 
of strength which have made famous the name of Rich- 



 



 

ard Coeur d% Lion, the English king, who won, in so re- 
markable a degree, the chivalrous respect and affection 
of the English people, and whose feats still live in the 
pages of the greatest of modern romances. 

Antonio was, in form, not altogether unlike Bill 
Sturdy. At all events, the resemblance was so great 
that the mate's description of Sturdy might easily be 
supposed to apply to him. Hence, when the Brazilian 
cast a scrutinizing glance over the persons of the crew, 
he at once selected Antonio as the one intended. 

'' That is the fellow," he muttered. " He looks pow- 
erful, but my good knife will prevent his being danger- 
ous to me, provided I steal upon him from behind, and 
give him one sharp, decisive blow." 

Bill Stnrdy was not the only one permitted to go on 
shore that evening. Several others had similar permis- 
sion extended to them, leaving behind only enough to 
keep the proper watch on board the vessel. 

A company, including Antonio, left the vessel together 
some five minutes before Bill Sturdy made his appear- 
ance. The Brazilian, fixing his attention upon him, 
followed them at a little distance, cautiously avoiding 
the appearance of doing so, lest he might attract obser- 
vation. He did not expect to carry out his design at 
present, partly because it was not yet dark, and partly 
also because he wished to wait till Antonio was alone. 
He was resolved to keep him in view, for hours, if need 
be, until a favorable opportunity should present itself 
for the commission of the crime he meditated. 

The first place which the men visited was a low drinking saloon, situated on a street considered hardly reputable. It was not long before they became noisy and 
drank. 

One by one they staggered out of the drinking-saloon. 
Among the last to go was Antonio. He had probably 
drank more than any of his comrades, but he had a 
strong head, and showed his potations less in his gait 
than many of the rest. He walked out with a steady 
step, somewhat to the disappointment of the Brazilian, 
who had been keeping vigilant guard, and relied upon 
the effects of the liquor to make him an easier conquest. 

It was already dark, but the street was too public, and 
he would be too liable to interruption and detection to 
make it pradent to attack at present. He therefore cau- 
tiously followed Antonio, hoping that he would presently 
turn into some narrow lane or alley. 

In this hope he was not disappointed. At a little 
distance there was a narrow alley leading fi'om the 
.street in which Antonio was now walking to another 
of  qTial size. Antonio stood a little doubtful at the 
ejitrance, but finally entered. If he had only known 
that there was one close upon his heels, who was track- 
ing him with the keenness of an Indian upon the trail 
of his foreman, he might have hesitated before entering 
what, to him, was destined to prove " the pass of death." 

But he did not know this. 

The alley was a long one, little frequented at that 
hour, and unlighted. Cautiously behind the doomed 
sailor walked the hired assassin. And now Antonio is 
nearly midway. Between them there is a distance of 
fifty feet. Over this interval creeps the murderer with 
noiseless feet. Then, snatching the ever-ready knife 
from his girdle, he lifts his hand, and the descending 







 

knife is buried in the back of Antonio, entering just 
below the neck. He sank to the ground with a convulsive shudder, and a sharp cry of pain. 

The Brazilian stood over him. Antonio looked up 
into his face, supposing it might be Bill Sturdy, whose 
enmity he judged by his own. 

And the thought came to him. 

Half lifting himself from the ground with his last remaining strength, he ejaculated, feebly, "Were you 
hired to do this?" 

" I was," said the assassin, briefly. 

Antonio could have but one thought, as to the one
