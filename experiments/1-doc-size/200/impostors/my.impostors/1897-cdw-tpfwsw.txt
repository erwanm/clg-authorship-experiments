who are liable to be ill-used by street 
boys and apprentices, who collect in 
immense crowds and stop the way. Of 
course Cassandra Stubbes, whose mind 
was set upon a better country, has little 
good to say of his countrymen: "As 
concerning the nature, propertie, and 
disposition of the people they be desir- 
ous of new fangles, praising things past, 
contemning things present, and covet- 
ing after things to come. Ambitious, 
proud, light, and unstable, ready to be 
in 



 

carried away with every blast of wind." 
The French paid back with scorn the 
traditional hatred of the English for 
the French. Perlin (1558) finds the 
people proud and seditious, with bad 
consciences and unfaithful to their 
word — " in war unfortunate, in peace 
unfaithful"; and there was a Spanish 
or Italian proverb : " England, good 
land, bad people." But even Perlin 
likes the appearance of the people : 
" The men are handsome, rosy, large, 
and dexterous, usually fair-skinned ; the 
women are esteemed the most beau- 
tiful in the world, white as alabaster, 
and give place neither to Italian, Flem- 
ish, nor German ; they are joyous, cour- 
teous, and hospitable (de bon recueil)." 
He thinks their manners, however, lit- 
tle civilized : for one thing, they have 
an unpleasant habit of eructation at the 
table (car iceux routent a la table sans 




 

honie & ignominie)', which recalls Chau- 
cer's description of the Trumpington f 
miller's wife and daughter : — 

" Men might her rowtyng hearen a forlong, 
The wenche routeth eek par companye." 

Another inference as to the table man- 
ners of the period is found in Coryat's 
" Crudities " (161 1). He saw in Italy gen- 
erally a curious custom of using a little 
fork for meat, and whoever should take 
the meat out of the dish with his fingers 
would give offence. And he accounts for 
this peculiarity quite naturally : " The 
reason of this their curiosity is, because 
the Italian cannot by any means indure 
to have his dish touched with fingers, 
seeing all mens fingers are not alike 
cleane." Coryat found the use of the 
fork nowhere else iri Christendom, and 
when he returned, and, oftentimes in 
h 



 

England, imitated the Italian fashion, 
his exploit was regarded in a humorous 
light. Busino says that fruits were sel- 
dom served at dessert, but that the 
whole population were munching them 
in the streets all day long, and in the 
places of amusement; and it was an 
amusement to go out into the orchards 
and eat fruit on the spot, in a sort of 
competition of gormandize between the 
city belles and their admirers. And he 
avers that one young woman devoured 
twenty pounds of cherries, beating her 
opponent by two pounds and a half. 

All foreigners were struck with the 
English love of music and drink, of ban- 
queting and good cheer. Perlin notes 
a pleasant custom at table: during the 
feast you hear more than a hundred 
times, " Drink ion" (he loves to air his 
English), that is to say, " Je m'en vois 
boyre a toy." You respond, in their 





 

language, " Iplaigin " ; that is to say, 
" Je vous plege." If you thank them, 
they say in their language, "God tanque 
artelay" ; that is, " Je vous remercie de 
bon coeur." And then, says the artless 
Frenchman, still improving on his Eng- 
lish, you should respond thus : "Bigod, 
sol drink ion agoud oin." At the great 
and princely banquets, when the pledge 
went round and the heart's desire of 
lasting health, says the chronicler, " the 
same was straight wayes knowne, by 
sound of Drumme and Trumpet, and 
the cannon's loudest voyce." It was 
so in Hamlet's day: — 

"And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish 
down, 
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out 
The triumph of his pledge." 

According to Hentzner (1598), the 
English are serious, like the Germans, 




 

and love show and to be followed by 
troops of servants wearing the arms of 
their masters ; they excel in music and 
dancing, for they are lively and active, 
though thicker of make than the French; 
they cut their hair close in the middle 
of the head, letting it grow on either 
side ; " they are good sailors, and bet- 
ter pyrates, cunning, treacherous, and 
thievish"; and, he adds, with a touch 
of satisfaction, " above three hundred 
are said to be hanged annually in Lon- 
don." They put a good deal of sugar 
in their drink; they are vastly fond of 
great noises, firing of cannon, beating of 
drums, and ringing of bells, and when 
they have a glass in their heads they go 
up into some belfry, and ring the bells 
for hours together, for the sake of exer- 
cise. Perlin's comment is that men are 
hung for a trifle in England, and that 
r ou will not find many lords whose par- 




 

ents have not had their heads chopped 
off. 

It is a pleasure to turn to the simple 
and hearty admiration excited in the 
breasts of all susceptible foreigners by 
the English women of the time. Van 
Meteren, as we said, calls the women 
beautiful, fair, well dressed, and modest. 
To be sure, the wives are, their lives 
only excepted, entirely in the power of 
their husbands, yet they have great lib- 
erty; go where they please; are shown 
the greatest honor at banquets, where 
they sit at the upper end of the table 
and are first served ; are fond of dress 
and gossip and of taking it easy ; and 
like to sit before their doors, decked out 
in fine clothes, in order to see and be 
seen by the passers-by. Rathgeb also 
agrees that the women have much more 
liberty than in any other place. When 
old Busino went to the Masque at 




 

Whitehall, his colleagues kept exclaim- 
ing, " Oh, do look at this one — oh, do 
see that ! Whose wife is this ? — and that 
pretty one near her, whose daughter is 
she?" There was some chaff mixed in, 
he allows, some shrivelled skins and 
devotees of S. Carlo Borromeo, but the 
beauties greatly predominated. 

In the great street pageants, it was
