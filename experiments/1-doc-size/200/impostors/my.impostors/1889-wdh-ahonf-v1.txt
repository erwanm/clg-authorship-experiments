noticed his attentions, and I don't say you did, but 
others certainly did ; and I must say that I didn't 
expect he would drop us so." 

" Drop us ! " cried Alma, in a fury. " Oh ! " 

" Yes, droj> us, Alma. He must know where we 
are. Of course, Mr. Wetmore 's spoken to him about 
you, and it 's a shame that he hasn't been near us. 



 

I should have thought common gratitude, common 
decency, would have brought him after — after all 
we did for him." 

" We did nothing for him — nothing f He paid his 
board, and that ended it." 

" No, it didn't, Alma. You know what he used 
to say — about its being like home, and all that ; 
and I must say that after his attentions to you, and 
all the things you told me he said, I expected some- 
thing very dif " 

A sharp peal of the door-bell thrilled through the 
house, and as if the pull of the bell-wire had 
twitched her to her feet, Mrs. Leigh ton sprang 
up and grappled with her daughter in their common 
terror. 

They both glared at the clock and made sure that 
it was five minutes after nine. Then they aban- 
doned them some moments to the unrestricted play 
of their apprehensions. 



II. 



" Why, Alma," whispered the mother, " who in 
the world can it be at this time of night ? You 
don't suppose ho " 

" Well, I 'm not going to the door anyhow, 
mother, I don't care who it is ; and of course he 
wouldn't be such a goose as to come at this hour." 
She put on a look of miserable trepidation, and 
shrank back from the door, while the hum of the 
bell died away in the hall. 

" What shall wo do ? " asked Mrs. Leighton 
helplessly. 

" Let him go away — whoever they are," said 
Alma. 

Another and more peremptory ring forbade them 
refuge in this simple expedient. 

"Oh dear! what shall we do? Perhaps it's 
a despatch." 

The conjecture moved Alma to no more than a 
rigid stare. " I shall not go," she said. A third 
ring more insistent than the others followed, and 
she said : " You go ahead, mamma, and I 'll come 
behind to scream if it's anybody. We can look 
through the sidedights at the door first." 



 

Mrs. Leigliton fearfully led the way from the 
back chamber where they had been sitting, and 
slowly descended the stairs. Alma came behind 
and turned up the hall gas-jet with a sudden flash 
that made them both jump a little. The gas inside 
rendered it more difficult to tell who was on the 
threshold, but Mrs. Leighton decided from a timor- 
ous peep through the scrims that it was a lady and 
gentleman. Something in this distribution of sex 
emboldened her ; she took her life in her hand, and 
opened the door. 

The lady spoke. " Does Mrs. Leighton live heah ]" 
she said, in a rich, throaty voice ; and she feigned a 
reference to the agent's permit she held in her hand. 

" Yes," said Llrs. Leighton ; she mechanically 
occupied the doorway, while Alma already quivered 
behind her "with impatience of her impoliteness. 

" Oh," said the lady, who began to appear more 
and more a young lady, " Ah didn't know but Ah 
had mistaken the ho'se. Ah suppose it 's rather 
late to see the Apawtments, and Ah most ask you 
to pawdon us." She put this tentatively, witli a 
delicately growing recognition of Mrs. Leighton as 
the lady of the house, and a humorous intelligence 
of the situation in the glance she threw Alma over 
her mother's shoulder. " Ah 'm afraid we most 
have frightened you." 

" Oh, not at all!' said Alma ; and at the same 
time her mother said, " Will you walk in, please ? " 

The gentleman promptly removed his hat and 
made the Lei srh tons an inclusive bow. " You awe 



 

very kind, madam, and I am sorry for the trouble 
we awe giving you." He was tall and severe-look- 
ing, vith a grey, trooperisli moustache and iron- 
grey hair, and, as Alma decided, iron-grey eyes. 
His daughter "was short, plump, and fresh-coloured, 
with an effect of liveliness that did not all express 
itself in her broad-vowelled, rather formal speech, 
with its odd valuations of some of the auxiliary 
verbs, and its total elision of the canine letter, 

"We awe from the Soath," she said, "and we 
arrived this mawning, but we got this cyahd from 
the brokah just bcfo' dinnali, and so we awe rathah 
late." 

"Not at all; it's only nine o'clock," said Mrs. 
Lcighton, in condonation. She looked up from the 
card the young lady had given her, and explained, 
" We haven't got in our servants yet, and we had to 
answer the bell ourselves, and " 

" You tcere frightened, of coase," said the young 
lady caressingly. 

The gentleman said they ought not to have come 
so late, and he offered some formal apologies. 

"We should have been just as much scared any 
time after five o'clock," Alma said to the sympathetic 
intelligence in the girl's face. 

She laughed out. " Of coase ! Ah would have 
my hawt in my moath all day long too, if Ah was 
living in a big hoasc alone." 

A moment of stiffness followed ; Mrs. Leighton 
would have liked to withdraw from the intimacy of 
the situation, but she did not know how. It was 



 

very well for these people to assume to be what they 
pretended ; but, she reflected too late, she had no 
proof of it except the agent's permit. They were 
all standing in the hall together, and she prolonged 
the awkward pause while she examined the permit. 
" You are Mr. Woodburn ? " she asked, in a way 
that Alma felt implied he might not be. 

" Yes, madam ; from Charlottesboag, Virginia' 
he answered, with the slight umbrage a man shows 
when the strange cashier turns his check over and 
questions him before cashing it. 

Alma writhed internally, but outwardly remained 
subordinate ; she examined the other girl's dress, 
and decided in a superficial consciousness that she 
had made her own bonnet. 

" I shall be glad to show you my rooms," said 
Mrs Leighton, with an irrelevant sigh. " You must 
excuse their being not just as I should wish them. 
We 're hardly settled yet." 

" Don't speak of it, madam," said the gentleman, 
"if you can overlook the trouble we awe giving you 
at such an unseasonable houah." 

"Ah'm a hoase-keepah mahself," Miss "Woodburn 
joined in, ' ' and Ah know ho' to accyoant fo' every- 
thing." 

Mrs. Leighton led the way upstairs, and the 
young lady decided upon the large front room and 
small side-room on the third story. She said she 
could take the small one, and the other was so large 
that her father could both sleep and work in it. 
She seemed not ashamed to ask if Mrs. Leighton's
