Look up and let me see these pale cheeks. Don't you want 
something to eat ?" 

" I don't know," said Ellen faintly. 

" What would you say to a cup of chicken broth ?" 

"I should like it very much !'' said Ellen with new 
energy. 

" Margery made me some particularly nice, as she always 
does ; and I took it into my head a little might not come 
amiss to you ; so I resolved to stand the chance of Sharp's 
jolting it all over me, and I rode down with a little pail of it 
on my arm. Let me rake open these coals and you shall 
have some directly." 

" And did you come without being spattered ?" said Ellen. 

"Not a drop. Is this what you use to warm things in? 
Never mind, it has had gruel in it ; I'll set the tin pail on the 
fi e ; it won't hurt it." 

" I am so much obliged to you," said Ellen, " for do you 
know I have got quite tired of gruel, and panada I can't 
bear." 

" Then I am very glad I brought it." 

While it was warming Alice washed Ellen's gruel cup and 
spoon ; and presently she had the satisfaction of seeing Ellen 
eating the broth with that keen enjoyment none know but 
those that have been sick and are getting well. She smiled 
to see her gaining strength almost in the very act of swallowing. 

" Ellen," said she presently, " I have been considering your 
dressing-table. It looks rather doleful. I'll make you a 
present of some dimity, and when you come to see me you 
shall make a cover for it that will reach down to the floor 
and hide those Long legs." 

"That wouldn't do at all," said Ellen; "aunt Fortune 
would go off into all sorts of fits." 

" What about ?" 

" Why the washing, Miss Alice — to nave such a great thing 
to wash every now and then. You can't think what a fuss 
she makes if I have more than just so many white clothes in 
the wash every week." 

" That's too bad," said Alice. " Suppose you bring it up 
to me — it wouldn't be often — and I'll have it washed for you, 
— if you care enough about it to take the trouble." 







" indeed I do !" said Ellen ; " I should like it very much ; 
and I'll get Mr. Van Brunt to — no I can't, aunt Fortune 
won't let me ; I was going to say I would get him to saw off 
the legs and make it low r er for me, and then my dressing-box 
would stand so nicely on the top. Maybe I can yet. Oh I 
never showed you my boxes and things." 

Ellen brought them all out and displayed their beauties. 
In the course of going over the -writing-desk she came to the 
secret drawer and a little money in it. 

" Oh that puts me in mind ! she said. " Miss Alice, this 
money is to be spent for some- poor child ; — now I've been 
thinking Nancy has behaved so to me I should like to give 
her something to show her that I don't feel unkindly about 
it — what do you think would be a good thing ?" 

" I don't know Ellen — I'll take the matter into consideration." 

" Do you think a Bible would do ?" 

" Perhaps that would do as well as anything ; — I'll think 
about it." 

" I should like to do it very much," said Ellen, " for she 
has vexed me wonderfully." 

"Well, Ellen, would you like to hear my other pieces of 
news? or have you no curiosity?" 

" yes indeed," said Ellen ; "I had forgotten it entirely ; 
what is it Miss Alice ?" 

" You know I told you one concerns only myself, but it is 
great news to me. I learnt this morning that my brother 
will come to spend the holidays with me. It is many 
months since I have seen him." 

" Does he live far away ?" said Ellen. 

" Yes, — he has gone far away to pursue his studies, and 
cannot come home often. The other piece of news is that I 
intend, if you have no objection, to ask Miss Fortune's leave 
to have you spend the holidays with me too." 

" Oh, delightful !" said Ellen, starting up and clapping her 
hands and then throwing them round her adopted sister's 
neck ; — " dear Alice how r good you are !" 

" Then I suppose I may reckon upon your consent," 
said Alice, " and I'll speak to Miss Fortune without delay." 

" thank you dear Miss Alice ; — how glad I am ! I shall 








be happy all the time from now till then thinking of it. You 
aren't going?" 
" I must." 

" Ah don't go yet ! Sit down again ; you know you're 
my sister, — don't you want to read mamma's letter ?" 

** If you please Ellen, I should like it very much." 

She sat down, and Ellen gave her the letter, and stood by 
while she read it, watching her with glistening eyes ; and 
though as she saw Alice's fill her own overflowed again, she 
hung over her still to the last ; going over every line this 
time with a new pleasure. 

" New York, Saturday, Nov. 22, 18 — . 
" My Dear Ellen, 

" I meant to have written to you before, but have been 
scarcely able to do so. I did make one or two efforts which 
came to nothing ; I was obliged to give it up before finishing 
anything that could be called a letter. To-day I feel much 
stronger than I have at any time since your departure. 

" I have missed you my dear child very much. There is not 
an hour in the day, nor a half hour, that the want of you does 
not come home to my heart ; and I think I have missed you 
in my very dreams. This separation is a very hard thing to 
bear. But the hand that has arranged it does nothing amiss ; 
we must trust Him my daughter that all will be well. I feel 
it is well ; though sometimes the thought of your dear little 
face is almost too much for me. I will thank God lhave had 
such a blessing so long, and I now commit my treasure to 
Him. It is an unspeakable comfort to me to do this, for 
nothing committed to his care is ever forgotten or neglected. 
Oh my daughter never forget to pray ; never slight it. It is 
almost my only refuge, now I have lost you, and it bears me 
up. How often — how often, — through years gone by, — 
when heart-sick and faint, — I have fallen on my knees, and 
presently there have been as it were drops of cool water 
sprinkled upon my spirit's fever. Learn to love prayer, dear 
Ellen, and then you will have a cure for all the sorrows of 
life. And keep this letter, that if ever you are like to forget 
it, your mother's testimony may come to mind again. 

" My tea, that used to be so pleasant, has become a sad meal 
to me. I drink it mechanically and set down my cup, remembering only that the dear little hand which used to minis- 
ter to my wants is near me no more. My child — my child ! 
— words are poor to express the heart's yearnings, — my spirit 
is near you all the time. 

" Your old gentleman has paid me several visits. The day 
after you went came some beautiful pigeons. I sent word 
back that you were no longer here to enjoy his gifts, and the 
next day he came to see me. He has shown himself very 
kind. And all this, dear Ellen, had for its immediate cause 
your proper and ladylike behavior in the store. That 
thought has been sweeter to me than all the old gentleman's 
birds and fruit. I am sorry to inform you that though I have 
seen him so many times I am still perfectly ignorant of his 
name. 

" We set sail Monday in the England. Your father has secured a nice state-room for me, and I have a store of comforts 
laid up for the voyage. So next week you may imagine me 
out on the broad ocean, with nothing but sky and clouds and 
water be seen around me, and probably much too sick to look 
at those. Never mind that ; the sickness is good for me. 

" I will write you as soon as I can again, and send by the 
first conveyance. 

" And now my dear baby — my precious child — farewell. 
May the blessing of God be with you ! 

' Your affectionate mother,
