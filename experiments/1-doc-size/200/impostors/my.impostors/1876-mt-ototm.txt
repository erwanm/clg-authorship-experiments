years afterwards I used to blush even in my sleep 
when I thought of it. I had become a good steers 
man ; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to 

do on our watch, night or day ; Mr. B seldom 

made a suggestion to me ; all he ever did was to 
take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in par- 
ticularly bad crossings, land the boat when she 
needed to be landed, play gentleman of leisure nine 
tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The 
lower river was about bank-full, and if anybody 
had questioned my ability to run any crossing be- 
tween Cairo and New Orleans without help or in- 
struction, I should have felt irreparably hurt. The 
idea of being afraid of any crossing in the lot, in 
the day-time, was a thing too preposterous for con- 
templation. Well, one matchless summer's day I 
was bowling down the bend above island 66, 
brim full of self-conceit and carrying my nose as 
high as a giraffe's, when Mr. B said, — 

"I am going below a while. I suppose you 
know the next crossing ? " 

This was almost an aflfront. It was about the 
plainest and simplest crossing in the whole river. 
One couldn't come to any harm, whether he ran it 
right or not ; and as for depth, there never had 
been any bottom there. I knew all this, perfectly 
well. 

Know how to run it ? Why, I can run it with 
my eyes shut." 


" How much water is there in it ? " 

" Well, that is an odd question. I couldn't get 
bottom there with a church steeple." 
. "You think so, do you?" 

The very tone of the question shook my confi- 
dence. That was what Mr. B was expecting. 

He left, without saying anything more. I began 

to imagine all sorts of things. Mr. B , unknown 

to me, of course, sent somebody down to the fore- 
castle with some mysterious instruction to the 
leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper 

among the officers, and then Mr. B went into 

hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could ob- 
serve results. Presently the captain stepped out on 
the hurricane dock ; next the chief mate appeared ; 
then a clerk. Every moment or two a straggler 
was added to my audience ; and before I got to the 
head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people 
assembled down there under my nose. I began to 
wonder what the trouble was. As I started across 
the captain glanced aloft at me and said, with a 
sham uneasiness in his voice, — 

"Where is Mr. B V* 

" Gone below, sir." 

But that did the business for me. My imagina- 
tion began to construct dangers out of nothing, and 
they multiplied faster than I could keep the run of 
them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal water 
ahead! The wave of coward agony that surged 
through me then came near dislocating every 




joint in me. All my confidence in that crossing 
vanished. I seized the bell-rope ; dropped it, 
ashamed ; seized it again ; dropped it once more ; 
clutched it tremblingly once again, and pulled it so 
feebly that I could hardly hear the stroke myself. 
Captain and mate sang out instantly, and both to- 
gether, — 

" Starboard lead there ! and quick about it ! '' 

This was another shock. I began to climb the 
wheel like a squirrel ; but I would hardly get the 
boat started to port before I would see new dangers 
on that side, and away I would spin to the other ; 
only to find perils accumulating to starboard, and 
be crazy to get to port again. Then came the 
leadsman's sepulchral cry : — 

" D-ee-p four ! " 

Deep four in a bottomless crossing ! The terror 
of it took my breath away. 

" M-a-r-k three ! M-a-r k three ! Quarter less 
three ! Half twain ! " 

This was frightful ! I seized the bell-ropes and 
stopped the engines. 

" Quarter twain ! Quarter twain ! Mark twain !" 

I was helpless. I did not know what in the 
world to do. I was quaking from head to foot, and 
I could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck 
out so far. 

" Quarter less twain ! Nine and a half ! " 

We were drawing nine! My hands were in a 
nerveless flutter. I could not ring a bell intelligible
with them. I flew to the speak into- tube and 
shouted to the engineer, — 

" Oh, Ben, if you love me, hack her ! Quick 
Ben ! Oh, back the immortal soul out of her ! " 

I heard the door close gently. I looked around 

and the'e stood Mr. B , smiling a bland, sweet 

smile. ThcE the audience on the hurricane deck 
sent uj- Si out of humiliating laughter. I saw it 
all, now, and I felt meaner than the meanest man 
in human history. I laid in the lead, set the boat 
in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said, — 

" It was a fine trick to play on an orphan u'osn't 
it ? I suppose I 'll never hear the last of how I was 
ass enough to heave the lead at the head of G6." 

" Well, no, you won't, maybe. In fact I hope you 
won't ; for I want you to learn something by that 
experience. Didn't you Icriow there was no bot- 
tom in that crossing ? " 

" Yes, sir, I did." 

" Ver well, then. You shouldn't have allowed 
me or anybody else to shake your confidence in 
that knowledge. Try to remember that. And 
another thing : when you get into a dangerous 
place, don't turn coward. That isn't going to help 
matters any." 

It was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly 
learned. Yet about the hardest part of it was that 
for months I so often had to hear a phrase which 
I had conceived a particular distaste for. It was, 
" Oh, Ben, if you love me, back her ! " 



CHAPTER VI. 



OFFICIAL RANK AND DIGNITY OF A PILOT. THE 
RISE AND DECADENCE OF THE PILOTS' ASSOCL 
ATION. 

In my preceding articles I have trie&, by going 
into the minutiae of the science of piloting, to carry 
the reader step by step to a comprehension of what 
the science consists of; and at the same time I 
have tried to show him that it is a very curious 
and wonderful science, too, and very worthy of his 
attention. If I have seemed to love my subject, it 
is no surprising thing, for I loved the profession 
far better than any I have followed since, and I 
took a measureless pride in it. The reason is 
plain : a pilot in those days, was the only un- 
fettered and entirely independent huiuan being 
that lived in the earth. Kings are but the ham- 
pered servants of parliament and people ; parlia 
ments sit in chains forged by their constituency ; 
the editor of a newspaper cannot be independent, 
but must work with one hand tied behind him by 
party and patrons, and be content to utter only 
half or two-thirdn of his mind ; no clergyman is a 
free man and may speak the whole truth, regard- 
less of his parish's opinions ; writers of all kinds 
are manacled servants of the public. We write 
frankly and fearlessly, but then we *' modify " 
before we print. In truth, ever man and woman 
and child has a master, and worries and frets in 
servitude ; but in the day I write of, the Missis- 
sippi pilot had 7ione. The captain could stand 
upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp of a very 
brief authority, and give him five or six orders, 
while the vessel backed into the stream, and then
