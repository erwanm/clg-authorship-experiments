" Then I will stay. Do you think it 's my duty to 
go?" she asked, referring her question first to Hal- 
leek and then to Atherton. She turned from the 
silence by which they tried to leave her free. " I 
don 't care for my duty, any more. I don 't want to 
keep him, if it 's so that he left me and and 
meant it and he doesn 't care for me any 
more." 

"Care for you? He never cared for you, Marcia! 
And you may be sure he doesn 't care for you now." 

" Then let him go, and let us go home." 

" Very well ! " said the old man. " We will go 
home, then, and before the week 's out Bartley Hub- 
bard will be a perjured bigamist." 

" Bigamist ? " Marcia leaped to her feet. 

" Yes, bigamist ! Don 't you suppose he had his 
eye on some other woman out there before he began 
this suit ? " 

The languor was gone from Marcia 's limbs. As she 
confronted her father, the wonderful likeness in the 
outline of their faces appeared. His was dark and 
wrinkled with age, and hers was gray with the anger 
that drove the blood back to her heart, but one im 
pulse animated those fierce profiles, and the hoarded 
hate in the old man 's soul seemed to speak in Marcia 's 
thick whisper, " I will go." 



 



XXXVIII. 

THE Athertons sat late over their breakfast in the 
luxurious dining-room where the April sun came in 
at the windows overlooking the Back Bay, and com 
manding at that stage of the tide a long stretch of 
shallow with a flight of white gulls settled upon it. 

They had let Clara 's house on the hill, and she had 
bought another on the new land ; she insisted upon 
the change, not only because everybody was leaving 
the hill, but also because, as she said, it would seem 
too much like taking Mr. Atherton to board, if they 
went to housekeeping where she had always lived ; 
she wished to give him the effect before the world of 
having brought her to a house of his own. She had 
even furnished it anew for the most part, and had 
banished as far as possible the things that remind 
ed her of the time when she was not his wife. He 
humored her in this fantastic self-indulgence, and phi 
losophized her wish to give him the appearance of 
having the money, as something orderly in its origin, 
and not to be deprecated on other grounds, since 
probably it deceived nobody. They lived a very 
tranquil life, and Clara had no grief of her own un 
less it was that there seemed to be no great things 
she could do for him. One day when she whimsi 
cally complained of this, he said : " I 'm very glad of 
that. Let 's try to be equal to the little sacrifices we 
must make for each other ; they will be quite enough. 
Many a woman who would be ready to die for her 




husband makes him wretched because she won 't live 
for him. Don 't despise the day of small things." 

" Yes, but when every day seems the day of small 
things ! " she pouted. 

" Every day is the day of small things," said Ather- 
ton, " with people who are happy. We 're never so 
prosperous as when we can 't remember what happened 
last Monday." 

" Oh, but I can 't bear to be always living in the 
present." 

" It 's not so spacious, I know, as either the past or 
the future, but it 's all we have." 

" There ! " cried Clara. " That 's fatalism ! It 's 
worse than fatalism ! " 

" And is fatalism so very bad ? " asked her hus 
band. 

" It 's Mahometanism ! " 

" Well, it isn 't necessarily a plurality of wives," 're 
turned Atherton, in subtle anticipation of her next 
point. " And it 's really only another name for resig 
nation, which is certainly a good thing." 

" Eesignation ? Oh, I don 't know about that  " 

Atherton laughed, and put his arm round her 
waist : an argument that no woman can answer in a 
man she loves ; it seems to deprive her of her reason 
ing faculties. In the atmosphere of affection which she 
breathed, she sometimes feared that her mental powers 
were really weakening. As a girl she had lived a life 
full of purposes, which, if somewhat vague, were un 
questionably large. She had then had great interests, 
art, music, literature, the symphony concerts, Mr. 
Hunt 's classes, the novels of George Eliot, and Mr. 
Fiske 's lectures on the cosmic philosophy ; and she 
had always felt that they expanded and elevated ex 
istence. In her moments of question as to the shape 
which her life had taken since, she tried to think 
whether the happiness which seemed so little depend- 



 

ent on these things was not beneath the demands of 
a spirit which was probably immortal and was cer 
tainly cultivated. They all continued to be part of 
her life, but only a very small part ; and she would 
have liked to ask her husband whether his influence 
upon her had been wholly beneficial. She was not 
sure that it had ; but neither was she sure that it had 
not. She had never fully consented to the distinct 
ness with which he classified all her emotions and 
ideas as those of a woman : in her heart she doubted 
whether a great many of them might not be those of 
a man, though she had never found any of them ex 
actly like his. She could not complain that he did 
not treat her as an equal ; he deferred to her, and de 
pended upon her good sense to an extent that some 
times alarmed her, for she secretly knew that she 
had a very large streak of silliness in her nature. 
He seemed to tell her everything, and to be greatly 
ruled by her advice, especially in matters of business ; 
but she could not help observing that he often kept 
matters involving certain moral questions from her 
till the moment for deciding them was past. When 
she accused him of this, he confessed that it was so ; 
but defended himself by saying that he was afraid her 
conscience might sway him against his judgment. 

Clara now recurred to these words of his as she sat 
looking at him through her tears across the breakfast 
table. " Was that the reason you never told me about 
poor Ben before ? " 

" Yes, and I expect you to justify me. What good 
would it have done to tell you ? " 

" I could have told you, at least, that, if Ben had 
any such feeling as that, it wasn 't his fault alto 
gether." 

" But you wouldn 't have believed that, Clara," said 
Atherton. " You know that, whatever that poor crea 
ture 's faults are, coquetry isn 't one of them." 



 

Clara only admitted the fact passively. "How did 
he excuse himself for coming back ? " she asked. 

" He didn 't excuse himself ; he defied himself. We 
had a stormy talk, and he ended by denying that he 
had any social duty in the matter." 

" And I think he was quite right ! " Clara flashed 
out. " It was his own affair." 

" He said he had a concrete purpose, and wouldn 't 
listen to abstractions. Yes, he talked like a woman. 
But you know he wasn 't right, Clara, though you talk 
like a woman, too. There are a great many things 
that are not wrong except as they wrong others. I 've 
no doubt that, as compared with the highest love her 
husband ever felt for her, Ben 's passion was as light 
to darkness. But * if he could only hope for its return 
through the perversion of her soul, through teaching 
her to think of escape from her marriage by a divorce, 
then it was a crime against her and against so 
ciety." 

" Ben couldn 't do such a thing ! " 

" No, he could only dream of doing it. When it 
came to the attempt, everything that was good in him 
revolted against it and conspired to make him help
