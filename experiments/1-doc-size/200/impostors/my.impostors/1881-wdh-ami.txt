after him ; but he did not accompany him down the 
street. It was plain that he did not wish to be any 
longer alone with Bartley, and the young man sus 
pected, with a sting of shame, that lie scorned to be 
seen with him. 



 



VIII. 

THE more Bartley dwelt upon his hard case, during 
the week that followed, the more it appeared to him 
that he was punished out of all proportion to his of 
fence. He was in no mood to consider such mercies 
as that he had been spared from seriously hurting 
Bird ; and that Squire Gaylord and Doctor Wills had 
united with Henry 's mother in saving him from open 
disgrace. The physician, indeed, had perhaps in 
dulged a professional passion for hushing the matter 
up, rather than any pity for Bartley. He probably 
had the scientific way of looking at such questions ; 
and saw much physical cause for moral effects. He 
refrained, with the physician 's reticence, from inquir 
ing into the affair ; but he would not have thought 
Bartley without excuse under the circumstances. In 
regard to the relative culpability in matters of the 
kind, his knowledge of women enabled him to take 
much the view of "the woman 's share that other wo 
men take. 

But Bartley was ignorant of the doctor 's leniency, 
and associated him with Squire Gaylord in the feel 
ing that made his last week in Equity a period of 
social outlawry. There were moments in which he 
could not himself escape the same point of view, 
could rebel against the severity of the condemnation 
he had fallen under in the eyes of Marcia and her 
father ; he could, in the light of example and usage, 
\n\vr\i at the notion of harm in his behavior to Han 
nah Morrison ; yet he found himself looking at it as 



 

a treachery to Marcia. Certainly, she had no right 
to question his conduct before his engagement. Yet, 
if he knew that Marcia loved him, and was waiting 
with life-and-death anxiety for some word of love from 
him, it was cruelly false to play with another at the 
passion which was such a tragedy to her. This was 
the point that, put aside however often, still present 
ed itself, and its recurrence, if he could have known 
it, was mercy and reprieve from the only source out 
of which these could come. 

Hannah Morrison did not return to the printing- 
office, and Bird was still sick, though it was now only 
a question of time when he should be out again. 
Bartley visited him some hours every day, and sat 
and suffered under the quiet condemnation of his 
mother 's eyes. She had kept Bartley 's secret with 
the same hardness with which she had refused him 
her forgiveness, and the village had settled down into 
an ostensible acceptance of the theory of a faint as 
the beginning of Bird 's sickness, with such other con 
jectures as the doctor freely permitted each to form. 
Bartley found his chief consolation in the work which 
kept him out of the way of a great deal of question. 
He worked far into the night, as he must, to make up 
for the force that was withdrawn from the office. At 
the same time he wrote more than ever in the paper, 
and lie discovered in himself that dual life of which 
every one who sins or sorrows is sooner or later 
aware : that strange separation of the intellectual 
activity from the suffering of the soul, by which the 
mind toils on in a sort of ironical indifference to the 
pangs that wring the heart ; the realization that, in 
some ways, his brain can get on perfectly well with 
out his conscience. 

There was a great deal of sympathy felt for Bart 
ley at this time, and his popularity in Equity was 
never greater than now when his life there was draw- 



 

ing to a close. The spectacle of his diligence was so 
impressive that when, on the following Sunday, the 
young minister who had succeeded to the pulpit of 
the orthodox church preached a sermon on the beauty 
of industry from the text " Consider the lilies," there 
were many who said that they thought of Bartley the 
whole while, and one a lady asked Mr. Savin if 
lie did not have Mr. Hubbard in mind in the picture 
he drew of the Heroic Worker. They wished that 
Bartley could have heard that sermon. 

Marcia had gone away early in the week to visit in 
the town where she used to go to school, and Bartley 
took her going away as a sign that she wished to put 
herself wholly beyond his reach, or any danger of 're 
lenting at sight of him. He talked with no one about 
her ; and going and coming irregularly to his meals, 
and keeping himself shut up in his room when he was 
not at work, he left people very little chance to talk 
with him. But they conjectured that he and Marcia 
had an understanding ; and some of the ladies used, 
such scant opportunity as he gave them to make sly 
allusions to her absence and his desolate condition. 
They were confirmed in their surmise by the fact, 
known from actual observation, that Bartley had not 
spoken a word to any other young lady since Marcia 
went away. 

" Look here, my friend," said the philosopher from 
the logging-camp, when he came in for his paper on 
the Tuesday afternoon following, " seems to me from 
what I hear tell around here, you 're tryin to kill 
yourself on this newspaper. Now, it won 't do ; I tell 
you it won 't do." 

Bartley was addressing for the mail the papers 
which one of the girls was folding. " What are you 
going to do about it ? " he demanded of his sympa 
thizer with whimsical sullenness, not troubling him 
self to look up at him. 



 

" Well, I haint exactly settled yet," replied the phi 
losopher, who was of a tall, lank figure, and of a 
mighty brown beard. " But I 've been around pretty 
much everywhere, and I find that about the poorest 
use you can put a man to is to kill him." 

" It depends a good deal on the man," said Bart- 
ley. " But that 's stale, Kinney. It 's the old formula 
of the auti-capital-punishment fellows. Try some 
thing else. They 're not talking of hanging me yet." 
He kept on writing, and the philosopher stood over 
him with a humorous twinkle of enjoyment at 
Bartley 's readiness. 

"Well, I ll allow it 's old," he admitted. "So 's 
Homer." 

" Yes ; but you don 't pretend that you wrote Ho 
mer." 

Kinney laughed mightily ; then he leaned forward, 
and slapped Bartley on the shoulder with his news 
paper. " Look here ! " he exclaimed, " I like you ! " 

" Oh, try some other tack ! Lots of fellows like 
me." Bartley kept on writing. "I gave you your 
paper, didn 't I, Kinney ? " 

" You mean that you want me to get out ? " 

" Far be it from rne to say so." 

This delighted Kinney as much as the last refine 
ment of hospitality would have pleased another man. 
" Look here ! " he said, " I want you should come out 
and see our camp. I can 't fool away any more time 
on you here ; but I want you should come out and see 
us. Give you something to write about. Hey ? " 

" The invitation comes at a time when circumstan - 
ces over winch I have no control oblige me to decline 
it. I admire your prudence, Kinney." 

" No, honest Injian, now," protested Kinney. 
"Take a day off , and fill up with dead advertise 
ments. That 's the way they used to do out in Alkali 
City when they got short of help on the Eagle, and 
we liked it just as well." 



 

" Now you are talking sense," said Bartley, looking 
up at him. " How far is it to your settlement ? " 

" Two miles, if you 're goin ; three and a half, if 
you aint." 

" When are you coming in ? " 

"I 'm in, now."
