" There is that last money I drew on the letter of 
credit, you can give that to Mr. Osson." 

" I have told him about that money," said the vice- 
consul, dryly. "It will be handed over to him when 
the estate is settled, if there isn 't enough to pay the 
bequests without it." 

" And the money which Mrs. Landa gave me before 
that," she pursued, eagerly. Mr. Orson had the effect 
of pricking up his ears, though it was in fact merely 
a gleam of light that came into his eyes. 

" That 's yours" said the vice-consul, sourly, almost 
savagely. " She didn 't give it to you without she 
wanted you to have it, and she didn 't expect you to 

pay her bequests with it. In my opinion," he burst 
out, in a wrathful recollection of his own sufferings 
from Mrs. Lander, " she didn 't give you a millionth 
part of your due for all the trouble she made you ; 
and I want Mr. Orson to understand that, right here." 

Clementina turned her impartial gaze upon Mr. 
Orson as if to verify the impression of this extreme 
opinion upon him ; he looked as if he neither accepted 
nor rejected it, and she concluded the sentence which 
the vice-consul had interrupted. " Because I rather 
not keep it, if there isn 't enough without it." 

The vice-consul gave way to violence. " It 's none 
of your business whether there 's enough or not. What 
you 've  got to do is to keep what belongs to you, and 
I 'm going to see that you do. That 's what I 'm here 
for." If this assumption of official authority did not 
awe Clementina, at least it put a check upon her head 
long self-sacrifice. The vice-consul strengthened his 
hold upon her by asking, "What would you do. I 
should like to know, if you gave that up ? " 

" Oh, I should get along," she returned, light-heart 
edly, but upon questioning herself whether she should 
turn to Miss Milray for help, or appeal to the vice- 
consul himself, she was daunted a little, and she 
added, " But just as you say, Mr. Bennam." 

" I say, keep what fairly belongs to you. It 's only 
two or three hundred dollars at the outside," he ex 
plained to Mr. Orson 's hungry eyes ; but perhaps the 
sum did not affect the country minister 's imagination 
as trifling; his yearly salary must sometimes have 
been little more. 



 

The whole interview left the vice-consul out of hu 
mor with both parties to the affair; and as to Clem 
entina, between the ideals of a perfect little saint, and 
a perfect little simpleton he remained for the present 
unable to class her. 



XXXV. 

CLEMENTINA and the vice-consul afterwards agreed 
that Mrs. Lander must have sent the will to Mr. Orson 
in one of those moments of suspicion when she dis 
trusted everyone about her, or in that trouble concern 
ing her husband 's kindred which had grown upon her 
more and more, as a means of assuring them that they 
were provided for. 

" But even then," the vice-consul concluded, " I 
don 't see why she wanted this man to come out here. 
The only explanation is that she was a little off her 
base towards the last. That 's the charitable suppo 
sition." 

" I don 't think she was herself, some of the time," 
Clementina assented in acceptance of the kindly construction. 

The vice-consul modified his good will toward Mrs. 
Lander 's memory so far as to say, "Well, if she'd 
been somebody else most of the time, it would have 
been an improvement." 

The talk turned upon Mr. Orson, and what he would 
probably do. The vice-consul had found him a cheap 
lodging, at his request, and he seemed to have settled 



 

down at Venice either without the will or without the 
power to go home, but the vice-consul did not know 
where he ate, or what he did with himself except at 
the times when he came for letters. Once or twice 
when he looked him up he found him writing, and 
then the minister explained that he had promised to 
"correspond" for an organ of his sect in the North 
west ; but he owned that there was no money in it. 
He Avas otherwise reticent and even furtive in his 
manner. He did not seem to go much about the city, 
but kept to his own room ; and if he was writing of 
Venice it must have been chiefly from his acquaintance with the little court into which his windows 
looked. He affected the vice-consul as forlorn and 
helpless, and he pitied him and rather liked him as a 
fellow-victim of Mrs. Lander. 

One morning Mr. Orson came to see Clementina, 
and after a brief passage of opinion upon the weather, 
he fell into an embarrassed silence from which he 
pulled himself at last with a visible effort. " I hardly 
know how to lay before you what I have to say, Miss 
Claxon," he began, " and I must ask you to put the 
best construction upon it. I have never been reduced 
to a similar distress before. You would naturally 
think that I would turn to the vice-consul, on such an 
occasion ; but I feel, through our relation to the to 
Mrs. Lander ah somewhat more at home with you." 

He stopped, as if he wished to be asked his busi 
ness, and she entreated him, " Why, what is it, Mr. 
Osson? Is there something I can do? There isn 't 
anything I wouldn 't ! " 



 

A gleam, watery and faint, which still could not be 
quite winked away, came into his small eyes. " Why, 
the fact is, could you ah advance me about five 
dollars ? " 

" Why, Mr. Osson ! " she began, and he seemed to 
think she wished to withdraw her offer of help, for 
he interposed. 

" I will repay it as soon as I get an expected remit 
tance from home. I came out on the invitation of 
Mrs. Lander, and as her guest, and I supposed " 

" Oh, don 't say a wo'd ! " cried Clementina, but 
now that he had begun he was powerless to stop. 

" I would not ask. but my landlady has pressed me 
for her rent I suppose she needs it and I have 
been reduced to the last copper " 

The girl whose eyes the tears of self pity so rarely 
visited, broke into a sob that seemed to surprise her 
visitor. But she checked herself as with a quick in 
spiration : " Have you been to breakfast ? " 

" Well ah not this morning," Mr. Orson admit 
ted, as if to imply that having breakfasted some other 
morning might be supposed to serve the purpose. 

She left him and ran to the door. u Maddalena, 
Maddalena ! " she called ; and Maddalena responded 
with a frightened voice from the direction of the 
kitchen : 

" Vengo subito ! " 

She hurried out with the coffee-pot in her hand, as 
if she had just taken it up when Clementina called; 
and she halted for the whispered colloquy between 
them which took place before she set it down on the 




table already laid for breakfast ; then she hurried out 
of the room again. She came back with a cantaloupe 
and grapes, and cold ham, and put them before Clem 
entina and her guest, who both ignored the hunger 
with which he swept everything before him. When 
his famine had left nothing, he said,, in decorous com 
pliment : 

"That is very good coffee, I should think the 
genuine berry, though I am told that they adulterate 
coffee a great deal in Europe." 

" Do they ? " asked Clementina. " I didn 't know 
it." 

She left him still sitting before the table, and came 
back with some bank-notes in her hand. " Are you 
sure you hadn 't betta take moa ? " she asked. 

" I think that five dollars will be all that I shall 
require," he answered, with dignity. "I should be 
unwilling to accept more. I shall undoubtedly receive
