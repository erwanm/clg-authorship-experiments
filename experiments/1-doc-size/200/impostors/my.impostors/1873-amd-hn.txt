of a restful soul. 

" Eleanor and Jessie are very nice," the girl went on 
"but if it wasn't for me, you would all fall asleep. Surplus
energy is one of the results or accidents which is it, 
Eleanor? of the nineteenth century. Doesn't that 
sound sententious, and almost like Carlyle ? Mamma, I'm 
not sure but there has been a mistake. I've crept into 
your family unaware, and though I'm no angel, you have 
all entertained me in the tenderest possible fashion. I am 
restless and uneasy, and when I think of growing up with 
nothing to do " 

" My dear," said her mother, " there is work for every 
one in this world." 

"But a little housekeeping and visiting, and thinking 
about one's dresses " 

" If you paid more attention to yours, Madge, it would 
not be amiss," exclaimed Eleanor, rather warmly. " Read- 
ing Carlyle, and all that, is not specially beneficial to you 
or any other very young girl." 

" But it seems to me that most lives are quite stupid." 

" O ! " said Jessie, in amaze. 

"You are so good and thoughtful, Jessie I I don't be- 
lieve that I could bother over children's dresses and poor 
women's babies, and I fancy that I should like to have 
some real work to do when I am grown. Mamma, do you 
not believe that there are women just fitted for some par- 
ticular employment? Men don't all rush hap-hazard into 
the same thing. Clement now has gone off to China to 
make a fortune, and every one compliments papa upon 
having such a business-like son. His genius is purely 
Commercial. Then Philip is quite crazy about medicine 
and surgery. Eleanor ought to marry a rich man, and be 
a great lady. Jessie would make a missionary, or else one 
of those sweet old maids whom every one adores. But I 
am troubled to know what my destiny will be." 

"You need not be for the next two or three years," said 
her mother. " A good education is the first important step." 

" I wonder why papa does not come ! " and Madge was 
off to the window. 

"It is past his time," remarked Jessie. " He must have 
missed the train." 

Madge peered out in silence for many moments, think- 
ing very rapidly, and yet she could not have separated one 
distinct idea from the confused mass. What she saw was 
a broad, sloping lawn, with an edge of leafless trees fronting 
the street like sentinels, groups of shadowy evergreens 
here and there, and the winding carriage-road, the hard 
path looking whiter than the surrounding ground. Not 
a footstep, not a rumble of wheels, however distant not 
even the wind moaning up and down. Out beyond there 
were millions of human beings ; and were any of them 
living a still, cold life, like this night ? What were they 
all doing, thinking, and suffering ? Ah, there came a 
bright star. Did it point any of them to the God up 
above ? 

She turned suddenly. The grate-fire was sending a 
cheerful glow through the room. It was such a pretty, 
home-like place ! The bright carpet and partly-worn furni- 
ture, without being at all shabby, had reached that pecu- 
liarly comfortable and tempting stage. A lounge with a 
pillow in the corner, easy-chairs, a wire stand in the bay- 
window, containing some geraniums and roses in bloom ; 
choice pictures, reflecting the ruddy fire-light, and here 
and there a gracefully carved bracket in black walnut, sup- 
porting a vase or tiny statue. Every one admitted that 
the sitting-room at Home Nook was the cosiest place in 
the world. The spacious parlor down stairs or drawing- 
room, in Eleanor's aristocratic parlance was nothing in 
comparison. 

There was fair Jessie peering into the changeful blaze, 
thinking, doubtless, of those shivering souls huddled to 
Aether on this cold night over a handful of fire. Eleanor 
sat in an arm-chair, grave and regal, like the queen she 





was. Tall, slender, but with a firm, round figure, that 
gave an expression of decision to what might otherwise 
have been languid grace. A smooth, white forehead, with 
the hair banded plainly above ; large, dark eyes, and a 
rather firm mouth, though the lips were a brilliant scarlet. 
She was a handsome girl, but the grand truths that set a 
seal upon some faces had not become her inheritance as 
yet. Meekness, tenderness, and long-suffering were not 
inborn, and would come to her only in some great strait 
of life after a severe battle. Seeing her there so calm and 
stately, something like this passed through Madge's mind. 
In her crude way, she had begun to speculate. 

But feeling and thought were evanescent with her. 
Another mood swept over her, and the next instant she 
knelt before the fire, and laid her head in her mother's lap. 

"Mamma," she exclaimed, "how very happy we arel 
We seem to have everything that we want ; so you must 
not think that I was discontented a while ago." 

"No, my dear, but I would like to have you remember 
from whom all these good gifts come." 

" Yes ; when anything particularly nice happens, I 
always feel like giving thanks. But, mamma " 

" Well ? " for the pause was a long one. 

"I wonder if any one ever toas thankful for trouble and 
misfortune ? " 

"Not at first, I suppose. After a while we begin to BGO 
where we might have strayed into sin or temptation but 
for this very trial laid upon us. Or we are taught some 
needful lesson brought nearer to God, and led to realize 
that our lives were given for a higher purpose than mere 
selfish aims and pleasures." 

" It is easy to talk about by this lovely fire, but could 
we bear it patiently? I wonder if every one doesn't 
theorize a good deal, and " 

"You do," said Eleanor, with a short laugh. "And 
Hannah must be dreaming and have forgotten the lights ;" 
to she rose and rang the bell. 



 

"O, w exclaimed Madge, disappointedly. "Sitting in 
the dark is so nice ! It always makes me feel like talking 
to mamma." 

A grave, middle-aged woman answered the summons. 
She lighted the lamp, and placed it upon the table in the 
centre of the room. 

" Mr. Ashburton is late," she said, slowly. " The dinner 
has been done some time." 

Mrs. Ashburton glanced at the French clock on tht 
mantel. Eleanor caught the anxious look. 

" They are very busy at the store, you know, and papa 
has staid late several evenings." 

" Yes," thoughtfully. 

Madge raised her brown eyes to her mother's face. 
Something flashed across her brain and rose in her throat 
at the same time a quick, nervous apprehension. She 
possessed one of those natures in which impressions are 
electrical. Eleanor always called them whims. The elder 
sister understood that an undue indulgence would prove 
dangerous to such a temperament. 

" What is the matter ? " asked Jessie. " You look as if 
there was a ghost in the room." 

" Like poor Mrs. Gradgrind ; " and she gave a short 
laugh. " I can't say that I have the ghost I was only 
thinking." 

"Mamma," began Eleanor, rather sharply, "it seems to 
me that Madge is falling into bad habits. She is full of 
fancies and caprices, and has no stability of purpose. She 
xeads too much." 

" Well, I will not look at another book to-night. I'll 
put my head here in mamma's lap and let her sermonize 
me." 

Mrs. Ashburton's slender fingers threaded her darling's 
sunny hair. Somehow, on this night, little Madge, with 
all her faults and short-comings, seemed very dear. She 
watched the bright glow stealing back to the cheek, and 





breathed a prayer for the child's future, that appeared 
much less assured than either of her sisters.' 

Madge thought, " What if something should happen to 
papa! " Nothing ever had, of course. He had come and 
gone daily, been spared accidents and misfortunes ; and
