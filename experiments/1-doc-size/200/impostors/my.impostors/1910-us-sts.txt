had dawned upon him that the Law, an institu- 
tion which he had revered, might be no sucK 
august thing at all, but an instrument of injus- 
tice and oppression. 

In that mood he came to the hotel. Again 
there was no one in the office, so he went directly 
to the room and knocked. There was no answer; 
he knocked again, more heavily. 

" I wonder if she's gone," he thought, and 
looked again at the number, to make sure he was 
at the right room. Then, timidly, he tried the 
door. 

It opened. " Lady," he said, and then louder, 
" Lady." 

There was no response, and he went in. Could 
she be asleep? he thought. No — that was not 
likely. He listened for her breathing. There 
was not a sound. 

And finally he went to the bed, and put his 
hand upon it. Then he started back with a cry 
of terror. He had touched something warm and 
moist and sticky. 

He rushed out into the hall, and as he looked 
at his hand he nearly fainted. It was a mass of 
blood ! 

"Helpl Help!" the boy screamed; and he 
turned and rushed down the stairs into the office. 

The proprietor came running in. "Look!" 
shouted Samuel. "Look what she's done!" 





" Good God ! " cried the man. And he rushed 
upstairs, the other following. 

With trembling fingers the man lit the gas; 
and Samuel took one look, and then turned away 
and caught at a table, sick with horror. The girl 
was lying in the midst of a pool of blood; and 
across her throat, from ear to ear, was a great 
gaping sht. 

"Oh! oh!" gasped Samuel, and then — "I 
can't stand it! " And holding out one hand from 
him, he hid his face with the other. 

Meantime the proprietor was staring at him, 
" See here, young fellow," he said. 

" What is it? " asked Samuel. 

" When did you find out about this? " 

*' Why, just now. When I came in." 

'" You've been out? " 

"Why of course. I went out just after we 
came." 

" I didn't see you." 

" No. I stopped in the office, but you weren't 
there." 

" Htmiph! " said the man, " maybe you did and 
maybe you didn't. You can tell it to the police." 

"The police!" echoed Samuel; and then in 
sudden horror — " Do you think I did it? " 

" I don't know anything about it," replied the 
other. " I only know you brought her here, and 
that you'll stay here till the police come." 





By this time several people had come into the 
room, awakened by the noise. Samuel, without 
a word more, went and sank down into a chair 
and waited. And half an hour later he was on 
his way to the station house again — this time 
with a policeman on either side of him, and grip- 
ping him very tightly. And now the charge 
against him was murder! 



CHAPTER XIII 

THE same corpulent official was seated behind 
the desk at the police station; but on this oc- 
casion he woke up promptly. " The chief had 
better handle this," he said, and went to the tele- 
phone. 

" Where's this chap to go? " asked one of the 
policemen. 

" We're full up," said tKe sergeant. " Put 
him in with Charlie Swift. The chief 'll be over
in a few minutes." 

So once more Samuel was led into a cell, and 
heard the door clang upon him. 

He was really not much alarmed this time, for 
he knew it was not his fault, and that he could 
prove it. But he was sick with horror at the fate 
of the unhappy girl. He began pacing back and 
forth in his cell. 

Then suddenly from one corner growled a 
voice: " Say, when are you going to get quiet? " 

" Oh, I beg pardon," said Samuel. " I didn't 
know you were here." 

" What are you in for? " asked the voice. 

" For murder," said Samuel. 

And he heard the cot give a sudden creak as 
the man sat up. "What! " he gasped. 


" I didn't do it," the boy explained hastily. 
" She killed herself." 

" Where was this? " asked the man. 

" At the Continental Hotel." 

" And what did you have to do with it? " 

" I took her there." 

"Who was she?" 

" Why— she called herself Mary Smith." 

" Where did you meet her? " 

" Up at ' Fairview.' " 

" At ' Fairview ' I " exclaimed the other. 

" Yes," said Samuel. " The Lockman place." 

"Albert Lockman's place?" 

" Yes." 

" How did she come to be there? " 

"Why, she was — a friend of his. She was 
there to dinner." 

"Whatl" gasped the man. "How do you 
know it? " 

" I work there," replied Samuel. 

" And how did she come to go to the hotel? " 

" Master Albert turned her out," said Samuel. 
" And it was raining, and so I took her to a 
hotel." 

" For the love of God! " exclaimed the other; 
and then he asked quickly, " Did you tell the 
sergeant that? " 

" No," said the boy. " He didn't ask me any- 
thing." 





The man sprang up and ran to the grated 
door and shook it. "Hello! Hello there!" he 
cried.
