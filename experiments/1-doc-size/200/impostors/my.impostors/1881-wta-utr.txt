the late pilot's statements seemed to be contradictory.

"What you have told me, Captain Garningham, entirely changes my
opinion. You were present, and you have told me exactly how the affair
happened. I supposed Peverell saw Buckner take the package. That makes
all the difference in the world in a court of law. No one saw Buckner
take the money, according to your evidence, except Nick. The supposed
robber was arrested down the wharf; he was searched, all the holes and
corners, including the river, were searched for the package, but it
could not be found. What evidence is there that Buckner took it?"

"I don't see any, except that of Nick Boomsby; and he don't tell his
story twice alike," I replied. "But, if Buckner did not take the money,
I can't see who did take it. I saw the messenger lay the package on the
counter; and the next thing I saw was Nick leaping over the counter."

"I don't say that Buckner did not take the package; on the contrary, I
believe he did take it; only there is not evidence enough to convict
him without Nick," argued Cornwood. "If I had known that Nick was to be
out of the way, I certainly should have taken the case, for a man who
has stolen four thousand dollars can afford to pay the lawyer well who
gets him out of the scrape."

I was disgusted with this logic, though it was perfectly consistent
with all I knew of the man. I did not care to say anything more about
the case.

"After hearing your version of the affair, Captain Garningham, I am
inclined to return to Jacksonville this afternoon, and offer my
services to the prisoner. When he gets out of jail he will have money
enough to pay me handsomely," chuckled the lawyer; "but perhaps I can
do something better if I can recover Colonel Shepard's lost
steam-yacht."

"Do you think you can recover it?" I asked, curiously.

"I am quite confident I can. I suppose you will sail as soon as the
weather will permit?" continued Cornwood.

"We shall. As I said, I am convinced that Captain Blastblow has simply
misunderstood his orders. I think he will proceed directly to New
Orleans, possibly touching at Key West."

"He will certainly put in at Key West; but he will probably be from ten
to twenty hours ahead of the Sylvania, and he will not wait for you. I
should like to see Colonel Shepard."

I called the colonel up from the cabin, and as it was raining in
torrents, I conducted him and the lawyer to my stateroom.

"For two hundred dollars--I can't work for nothing, and find myself,
though I should be glad to do so for Colonel Shepard--I will recover
and return your yacht to you at Key West, or at some point this side of
there; half down to pay my expenses, and half when the Islander is
delivered to you," said Cornwood.

"I haven't much confidence in you, Mr. Cornwood, and I don't care to
advance any money to you," replied the owner of the lost steamer.

"Quite natural, colonel. I will do it without any advance. But in half
an hour it will be too late to do anything," replied Cornwood, not at
all repelled by the colonel's lack of confidence in him. "I must be in
Cedar Keys to-morrow night; and I must be in Jacksonville this evening
in order to do it. I shall get to Key West Sunday morning, and find the
Islander there."

The plan was considered at length, and finally the colonel assented to
it, and wrote the instructions for Cornwood. He hastened on shore.




CHAPTER X.

INTELLIGENCE OF THE ISLANDER.


It rained very hard all the rest of the day and all night, and it
continued to blow heavily until the next morning. It was not till noon
that the ocean looked quiet enough to induce us to take ladies to sea
again, after the experience of the day before. We had lost twenty-four
hours, and if the Islander had not put in at some inlet, or made a lee
under Cape Canaveral, was half way to Key West. It was useless to think
of overtaking her on the passage, unless she had spent a day in
Mosquito Inlet.

Colonel Shepard's letter was addressed to Captain Blastblow, though it
was an open one, directing him to await the arrival of the Sylvania at
Key West. I had no faith in Cornwood; but I was willing to believe he
thought he could intercept the Islander at Key West, or he would not
have gone on a "wild-goose chase" at his own expense. If he recovered
the steam-yacht he would get two hundred dollars for his services; if
he failed, he would get nothing. So far as I could see, no risk was
incurred by the colonel in allowing the Floridian to go on this
mission.

The weather was delightful after we got outside of the harbor of St.
Augustine. The wind was west, and the air was as balmy as summer. We
placed easy-chairs on the quarter-deck for the ladies. The long swells
of the ocean gave a steady and regular roll to the vessel. The party
declared that the sail was "perfectly delightful," and they did not see
how the sea could be so angry and savage as it had been the day before.

The mate noted the departure from St. Augustine light at half-past
twelve. I had a chart laid out on my table in the stateroom, on which I
had marked the route of the vessel to Key West, with the courses and
distances, in red ink. It was our rule to heave the lead every hour,
though the Sylvania made a regular average of ten knots an hour when
she was not hurried. When we came to a point of land, or any opening in
the coast, we could tell what it was.

According to the Coast Pilot, which was always kept on the shelf, by
the side of the binnacle, it was eighty-five miles to Cape Canaveral.
In just eight hours and a half, if we made our ordinary speed, we
should be abreast of this cape. We kept as close to the coast as the
depth of water would permit, for there were no shoals or other dangers
to fear. If we went out far enough, we should have the current of the
Gulf Stream against us.

As soon as we were fairly on our course I began to think over the
mission of Cornwood. I had no doubt that he was a rascal. I considered
whether or not it would be possible for him to do me or Colonel Shepard
any harm, on the one hand, or any good on the other. He had received no
money, and was to receive none until he earned it.

He was to arrive at Key West on Sunday morning. The Sylvania would not
be likely to reach the same port before Sunday noon. If the Islander
had kept on her course during the twenty-four hours we had been at
anchor, she would be likely to reach Key West on Saturday afternoon. I
did not know that she had any occasion to put in there at all; if she
had, she was not likely to remain there many hours. If the Islander had
not put in at any port during the storm, Cornwood would not arrive at
his destination until after she had departed.

The interesting question was whether she had or had not made a port in
the storm. If I had had no ladies on board, I should not have thought
of such a thing as going into St. Augustine on account of the bad
weather. Captain Blastblow, according to his own statement, was a
thorough seaman, and, judging by my own feelings, it was not probable
that he had made a port.

But I was not quite satisfied on this point, and I had not so much
confidence in the captain of the Islander as he seemed to have in
himself. Our chart indicated only one port where he could have gone in,
and that was Mosquito Inlet, which had hardly water enough at high tide
to allow the Islander to run through the narrow passage that leads from
Hillsboro River out into the ocean. The inlet is sixty-five miles from
St. Augustine light.

The town of New Smyrna is two or three miles up Hillsboro River,
between which and St. Augustine and Jacksonville a small steamer plies
regularly. I had about made up my mind to run up the inlet as far as
the depth of water would permit, and see if I could find any one who
could give me any information in regard to the Islander. I had hardly
reached this conclusion when I was called to dinner. I was to dine in
the cabin, and I told the party what I intended to do.

"I don't care to have you delay your voyage for me, Captain Alick,"
replied Colonel Shepard.

"We started out to catch the Islander, and I am as anxious to do it as
you are," I added.

"I suppose you wish to get rid of us," interposed Miss Edith.

"Not at all; after I invited you to make the trip with us, and was
anxious to have your company, I shall not be in haste to get rid of
you. On the contrary, it must be that you wish to get rid of me, or you
would not have chosen to go in the Islander."

"Forgive me, Captain Alick; I did not mean it," replied the fair
maiden. "But we are so comfortable and so happy that we shall be in no
haste to get out of the Sylvania."

"Isn't there danger in going into such a place, Alick," asked my
father.

"I think not, sir," I answered. "I have a chart with the soundings on
it, and I am sure I can run into the inlet in the day-time; and it will
not be dark at seven, when we get there."

No further objection was raised to my plan. Just before the time set
for reaching the point off the inlet, all hands were on the lookout for
it. From my chart I learned that the inlet, on account of the shifting
sand, had moved to the southward about a quarter of a mile. For a
considerable distance on each side of the narrow channel leading into
the inlet and river, there were breakers, such as we had seen on the
coast of North Carolina, and at various points south of it.

Washburn was the first to discover the opening, and point it out to me.
I looked on the shore for a couple of wrecks whose positions were laid
down on the chart; but I could not find them. The shoals were caused by
the sand brought out of the inlet by the current of the river. The bar
changed with every storm; but I could plainly see the channel, for its
waters were less disturbed and broken by the rollers from the sea.

"It looks a little risky," said Washburn, shaking his head.

"I think not; the tide will be high in about an hour, and that will
give about eight feet and a half on the shoalest places," I replied. "I
