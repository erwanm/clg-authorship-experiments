bargain — women haven't that faculty. But the 
old house will soon need a good deal of repair- 
ing and modernizing, and you never get back the 
money you spend. What a pity it wasn't just 
the new town ! Suburban property is one of 
the things you can never be certain about ; it may 
lie unproductive for years. And I have such a 
fine investment for your money. I am sorry 
you didn't squeeze Winchester a little harder, and 
make him pay down more, but I suppose he 
pleaded misfortunes and all that, and you were 
tender-hearted } " 

She had let him make his own terms. What 
would Mr. Vantine say if he had known of her 
wish to donate the house to a charity. 

" Mr. Winchester has been unfortunate," she 
answered briefly. 

" Yes ; but, my dear girl, if one set out to pity 





all the unfortunate people, one would need to 
have a long purse indeed. And I dare say in 
a few years he will make a big profit on the 
land. Seventy acres! Well, right here in the 
city it would be tremendous ; "and he laughed 
with unction. 

Sabrina was very glad of a few days' quiet in 
which to arrange her future a little. It would 
be different — it must be different. The old 
round of fashion and admiration and pleasure 
no longer satisfied her. There were higher, 
purer joys ; there was a dread accountability she 
could not throw off carelessly. ' To whom much 
was given much would be required.' She could 
not evade. Much had been given to her. Not 
wealth merely. She had all the strength and 
richness of youth, she had many womanly gifts, 
as she was beginning to understand, — To grow 
brave and thoughtful, to make the higher virtues 
attractive, to win others to find pleasure and 
sweet reward in aims worth living for. An 
ideal had been suddenly awakened in her, but 
this, like the sunshine, must warm and revivify 
those without, or it will prove of no avail. 

She had supposed she would be married pres- 
ently ; nearly all girls were, and she had not lacked 
opportunities hitherto. But marriage has a new 
sanctity in her eyes. It is not because she and 



Pearl have discussed it — lovers have been quite 
outside of their summer's efforts. She has simply 
seen a sweet, outgiving woman, too essentially 
true to flirt, and a man who has been " about his 
Master's business," but whose truth and noble- 
ness would glorify any life, perhaps. She will 
not be silly enough to hold herself aloof, to de- 
cline a comforting friendship, because the love 
might have been offered and was not. When the 
time comes she will rejoice in their happiness. 

Meanwhile, she must make beautiful the new 
truths that have found a foothold in her soul. 
There are girls and women in her very circle who 
are longing to be uplifted, encouraged, who can- 
not well go out of it any more than she. A 
warm, sympathetic attitude will bring them to- 
gether, cheer them, render possible the good 
work Pearl has been doing. One need not go to 
the slums. It is " Whatsoever thy hand findeth." 
And she is to make religion look lovely in her 
own circle, to win others, to help those who are 
weakly struggling, who long to believe and do. 
Can she show by her living that she has been in 
the King's Country? 







CHAPTER XVII 

WITH SKIES SERENE 

The season was at its height. There were 
teas, receptions, some notable weddings, — the 
Patriarchs' and the Batchelors where the young 
"buds" were crowding in eagerly. 

Mrs. Vantine was distinctly captious. Other 
chaperons had married off their charges, and 
were patronizing elegant brides. Sabrina was 
twenty-four, and had been in society six years. 
It was mortifying, to say the least. 

Yet, she admitted to herself that Sabrina had 
never been more beautiful, seldom as gracious. 
The little touch of coldness had often kept peo- 
ple at a distance. It was very well with your 
inferiors, and with the nouveaux riches^ but Sabrina 
had unconsciously carried it to extremes where 
men were concerned. And now she would surely 
be relegated to a second or third place, with these 
new " fads." 

" It is mortifying when we have both done our 
best for her," said Mrs. Vantine complainingly 





to her husband. " You have doubled her money, 
and I have given her every advantage. The next 
thing will be her going over to one of those 
'settlements' where you live with the poor and 
nurse them and wait on them. My opinion is 
that we pamper the poor too much. They ought 
to be set to work." 

" Yes,' said her husband indifferently, studying 
the list of stocks. 

Mrs. Vantine sighed. 

"I shall give a dance for the young people,' 
she began presently. "We have been fearfully 
dull this winter. And there are only three weeks 
more of the season. I felt sure Sabrina would 
be married by this Easter. If she will be so 
obstinate " — 

Mr. Vantine began to doze. 

But Miss Eastwood had not found it stupid. 
True, she had not danced as much, not tired her- 
self over trivialities. She had gone a little out of 
the old paths. With a delicate consideration she 
managed to bring pleasures to the fresh young 
souls who, in the first dawn of delight, could not 
believe in any hollowness. Some who had con- 
sidered her cold and exclusive, warmed to her, 
glanced at her wistfully, entreated little favors 
with hesitation, then adored her in so new a man- 
ner that Sabrina was surprised. Could she win 





Others to love her as Stacy had ? Could she be a 
friend to young girls, and influence them if even 
a little in the way of a more serious womanhood? 
It seemed to her as if the world was waking up 
on the subject, but it was only that her eyes were 
opened to discern earnest souls, such as there had 
been from the beginning. There was more heart 
even in conventional charity than she had be- 
lieved. 

Pearl had been called away by the illness of her 
brother, and then had gone to Florida with him 
and his wife. Sabrina had to welcome Mrs. 
Duane and induct her into her new home, to 
which she had added some gifts besides the 
piano. She studied Mrs. Duane with a new 
interest. The graces and dignity of her old- 
fashioned formalisms became her so well. She 
could recall some of the grandmothers in society 
who had just this quaint refinement, supposed to 
be an inheritance of blue blood. A little pros- 
perity and happiness had worked a wonderful 
transformation. How much was wasted every- 
where that might go far toward redeeming worthy 
people, instead of leaving them to want, misery, 
and despair. 

Rhea's bright dark eyes spoke eloquently ; yet 
her nature was not effusive. There had not been 
much sentiment among those with whom her 





early life had been spent, though they were often 
kind to each other. But no matter how intensely 
your soul went into your work, it was mere com- 
modity, and paid for by the money. You could
