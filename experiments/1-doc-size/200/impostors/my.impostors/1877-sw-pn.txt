" I thought, very appropriate." 

"Why they were just in great want, sir; even 
of the most ordinary comforts." 

" A good time to remind themselves of their extraordinary comforts." 

" What had they, to justify them in talking of 
their 4 cup running over ' ? " 

"Something which they know who know, Miss 
Flora, and other people would try in vain to com 
prehend." 

"Well, the other word, 'I shall not want;' they 
were in want already." 

"No," said Meredith, "excuse me. I have read 
what comes after." 

" They were in want, Ditto, certainly." 



 

" Only such want Never mind, I will not forestall my story." 

" What is the other psalm ? " Flora asked. 

"Very beautiful in this connection," said Mr. 
Murray, who had got out his Bible. " It begins, 
 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are 
of a clean heart.'" 

" There again ! " said Flora, " What reason had 
they just then to think that he was good?" 

"That is faith, Miss Flora." 

" Faith ? " the young lady repeated. 

"Yes. Faith takes on trust, when it cannot see." 

Flora looked at the speaker. 

" The psalm goes on to describe the temptations 
to doubt which had beset the psalmist on observing the prosperity of wicked people and the hard times the Lord's people often had ; and then how he 
saw his mistake ; and then he breaks out, Whom 
have I in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon 
earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my 
heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, 
and my portion forever.' " 

"That is beautiful, and appropriate," said Flora. 

"As soon as a man gets where he can say 'Thou 
shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory,' he can stand a few ups and 
downs in this life. The choice of passages made 
by that old man was beautiful in the extreme ; and 
proved not only that he knew the Bible, but that 
it was part of his life." 

"And the chapter of Romans?" 



 

" A worthy third in the trio. That is a chapter 
of triumph in the Christian's privilege and hopes, 
ending 'Who shall separate us from the love of 
Christ ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, 
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . v . 
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquer 
ors, through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor 
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor 
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any 
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the 
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' " 

Flora's eyes filled, and she said nothing; and 
Meredith took up his book again. 

" There is another word in that chapter that fits, 
sir;  All things shall work together for good to 
them that love God.'" 

 ' It would certainly take faith to believe that" 
said Flora. " I can imagine a little that other things 
and hopes might console people suffering trouble 
in their persons and goods; but now, for instance, 
what possible benefit could it be to those people 
to have their houses burned, and to be driven 
into the wild wood with no shelter and nothing 
or very little to eat, and likewise very little to 
put on?" 

" Well, T had better read," said Meredith. ' Pastor Harms stops there, after telling how old Drewes 
recited Scripture, and asks, 4 Could my dear readers 
all of them have done as much ? just ask yourselves 
once quietly ; and whoever is forced to say, " I could 



 

not do it," let him be ashamed from the bottom of 
his heart ! 

"'A special impression was made by the words, 
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow 
of death," etc., and those others, " my heart and my 
flesh faileth," etc., and again, " I am persuaded, that 
neither death nor life," etc., and after they had all 
sat still a while, they raised their heads up cheerfully, took each other's hands, and broke out with 
one voice in the words 

" Dennoch bleibe ich stets an Dir," etc.' " 

"What does that mean, Ditto?" 

" ' Nevertheless, I am continually with thee.' 
'Then they went quietly to sleep in the wood, 
and lodged there beautifully, warm and safe under the wings of their God, and beneath the sheltering arms of the fir-trees; so that the sun was 
already shining through the branches when they 
waked up. Then they milked the cows, to get 
some breakfast for the children, and after that they 
all gathered round the old father to remind him of 
his promise. And the old man did not delay, but 
prayed first the twenty-seventh, and then the forty- 
second and forty-third psalms, and for the last, the 
twelfth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews ; 
so devoutly and so confidingly and so unhesitatingly, that they all could not have supposed but 
that he was reading to them out of the big Bible 
that had been under the arm-chair; and in most 
of the parts they prayed with him -word for word. 
Then they looked gratefully to the old man, and 



 

after they had first asked the blessing, then drunk 
the milk, and at last said grace, the others remained 
in the wood; but the two peasants, Drewes and 
Hinz with their two servants set out to go back to 
the place where their houses had stood. As they 
went off, the old father Hinz called after them, as 
if he were in a dream, " Children, see about the 
books too ! " Slowly they drew near the place of 
the conflagration; carefully listening and looking 
around them ; but nothing was to be seen or heard, 
all was as still as death, only the birds were hopping and singing in the branches. At last they 
came within view of the place where the fire had 
been; but just as they were about to run thither, 
a low moaning came to their ears from the corner 
of the wood, near the place of the fire. They were 
Christians, therefore they did not do like the priest 
and the Levite, but like the kind-hearted Samaritan; they went off towards the quarter from which 
the moans came; and what did they see? Two 
badly wounded soldiers, sitting in the two grand 
father's chairs at the corner of the wood. How came 
they there? The troops on their march through 
had had these wounded fellows with them; who 
for their weakness proved unable to go any further ; so their comrades determined to leave them 
behind. But to let the houses stand for the sake 
of affording them shelter, was more than the in 
flamed rage of the soldiers, disappointed at finding 
everything empty, could see their way to. However, to shew some sort of humanity to their comrades, they had dragged the two old chairs out of 
the houses to the corner of the wood, placed the 
wounded men in them, and then completed their 
work of destruction ; following which they had all 
marched off. And now, when the wounded sol 
diers saw standing before them the four men whose 
houses their comrades had laid in ashes, they look 
ed for nothing else but death. But not anger nor 
revenge, but peace, yes, blessed joy, beamed from 
the faces of those four men; God had certainly 
saved their beloved books for them. Now they did 
not care that their houses were gone. The soldiers 
were treated, not as foes, but as benefactors. They 
carried them away into the wood where the rest of 
the people were ; and when the chairs were seen, 
and the seats were lifted up, and the books found 
uninjured, then there was a thanksgiving and 
praising and glorifying so loud and so glad, that 
the angels in heaven must have joined in; the very 
little children ran to the books and kissed them devoutly and gleefully. The two soldiers were tended 
as if they had been blood kindred ; milk was given 
them to drink ; and now also, since the host of incendiaries had marched away, the way was open 
to fetch food again out of the villages. It was proposed to bring the wounded men to the nearest 
hamlet; but they were too weak for it; and they 
begged that they might be kept in the huts in the 
wood. And now it came to pass that nothing refreshed those two soldiers, more than old Father 
Hinz's talk from the word of God, and his prayers.
