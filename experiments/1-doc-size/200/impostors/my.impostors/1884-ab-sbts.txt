hotel at the other end of the city, anxious to be as far 
as possible from the place where he would expect to 
find her. Then she wrote two notes, one to Mr. 
Rose, giving her present address, and, with no reason, 
charging him to keep it a secret. The shorter the word 
she had promised Oswald, the more easily could it be 
written. Pity and love begged to be heard, but she- 
thrust them back. 

" You must never come near me or write to me. 



 

cannot be changed, so do not trouble me. You must 
make her happy. It hurts me most to think how we 
have wronged her." 

Oswald, as she had expected, did not wait for 
a message, but was early at her rooms. Daylight 
had simplified matters for him. Nothing looked 
as tragic as it had, the night before. He did not 
feel himself as hopelessly at the mercy of two 
jealous women, and, as a result of having been so, he 
was aware of a touch of provocation that acted as a 
wonderful tonic. Victoria's delirium would have 
cooled, as his own had done. And his wife ? He had 
not yet reached the point of deciding upon her dis- 
posal. He was in the habit of feeling that if a rela- 
tion had ceased to be necessary to him, it had ceased 
to exist. Inconvenient encumbrances always dropped 
away of themselves, like dead leaves. He would not 
waste thought on the manner of their going. The 
morning was fine, and with the accompanying courage 
which attends an access of keener animal vigor, he felt 
himself master of the situation. He thought of Vic- 
toria and the strait she had put him in, with a half- 
resentful pride in her. Fierce, beautiful creature ! Do 
you, sir, think the worse of your horse because he cur- 
vets and shies occasionally, if you are convinced that 
his neck is thereby arched and his nostrils dilated, 
even when you know your own bones are in some slight 
danger ? When Oswald reached the door on Tremont 
Street, he found the janitor sweeping down the stairs. 
' She's gone away," said that functionary, laconic- 
ally, stooping for a paper that kept blowing beyond his 
reach. 





u Gone away ? " echoed Oswald, stopping short, but 
only connecting the words with an absence of minutes. 
" Do you know when she will be in ? ' 

" Not yet awhile, I guess. She took her trunks with 

her." 

No questioning could elicit more. Did he know 
where her trunks had been sent ? No, he hadn't 
heard. Oswald hurried away, with his belief in the 
general amiability of events somewhat shattered. So 
she meant to elude him ! . Too thoroughly alarmed for 
anger, he went home first, to see if any letters had been 
delivered. There were none, and as he only stopped 
to open the hall-door and ask the question, no one 
thought to mention his wife's going. He went to the 
theater to find Rose, who received him coolly. The 
manager had Victoria's note in his pocket, and, little 
as it told, he suspected much. Quite ignorant of the 
nature of the wrong, he knew it lay somewhere, and all 
his honest heart was alive with indignation. Victoria's 
general fearlessness put him out of patience. He had 
a strong desire to say, " I told you you'd come to 
grief," but remembered her mother, and the watch- 
dog instinct rose in him. 

" Good morning, Rose," said Oswald, dropping into 
a saunter, and trying to assume the coolness that was 
never so far from his control as at the moment. 
" I called for Miss Lander's address. She neglected 

to give it me." 

" Did she ? " said the manager, looking at him stead- 
ily. " That isn't odd, for she told me nobody was 

to have it." 

Oswald saw he was on the defensive. It annoyed 



 

him to meet a counter-check from so insignificant a 
quarter. 

" Ah ? But she would except me, I think. It will 
be safe with me." 

' It's safer where it is." 

''' Has she gone out of town ? " asked Oswald, pleas- 
antly. 

' Yes," said the watch-dog, lying without the slightest 
compunction. 

" And it's of no use " 

' No," said Rose, advancing ominously, though his 
intentions embraced nothing more serious than an en- 
counter of words. :< And I want to speak to you " 

" Another time, then," answered Oswald, lifting his 
hat and walking away. He had no idea of being called 
to account by a fellow who was generous with his neg- 
atives and sparing of various advantages afforded by 
the English language. 

Going home again, he found the notes written by 
the two women. Victoria's was opened first. So she 
was likely to give him trouble enough, well worth it as 
she was ! Little sympathy as he had with her scruples, 
he felt, at every turn in the pursuit that hid her from 
him, an increasing admiration of her. 

All the trouble she gave him only added to his grow- 
ing bitterness against his wife, for having existed at all. 
But her written line seemed a solution. Courage ! she 
had taken herself away. The probabilities being 
against his inviting her back, she would doubtless have 
the good-sense not to come. When he left Rose that 
morning, it was with a smile on his face. Rose had 
betrayed himself. If Victoria were out of town it was 





at Rose's own house in Birchwood. Nothing was more 
simple. She had no other friend ; the manager's very 
glance showed that she had confided in him, and that 
he had constituted himself her guardian. It was quite 
evident that she feared pursuit. He smiled again at that 
and the thought that she would find herself mistaken. 
Oswald had reduced the subjugation of woman to a 
science. He knew that, under most trying circum- 
stances, a judicious letting alone was a maneuver not 
to be despised. The most untamable easily suc- 
cumbed after she had been left in the dark to sob her- 
self sick. Victoria should have plenty of time for re- 
flection. He would not entreat again, but await the 
rapture of seeing this proud creature creeping toward 
his arms. So he made himself busy that day, to 
avoid thought ; attended to some money matters 
which had been hanging on for weeks, invited Grim- 
wald to lunch, trying to be amused by his rampant 
criticism on certain late music, and at night took 
the boat for New York. Arrived in that gay and busy 
city, he threw himself into its arms and said, ' Enter- 
tain me." The first day passed and he went to the 
theater. The curtain, lights, even the indescribable 
smell of the place musty, but delicious to the theater- 
goercast him back into Boston and before ^j.he stage 
where he had seen her walk so of ten. ? TheT.- comedy 
faded out. Other people about him laughed and ap- 
plauded, but before his eyes moved only ^ white 
vision. Her great worth, his great desire of posses- 
sion, surged up again, and overthrew his interest in 
paltry tactics. Surely his only place was at her feet. 
The next night he was on his way home. Reading 



 

Elizabeth's telegram, which he found there, awoke 
only a mild interest, a little wonder, too, that she 
should have sent for him. He had cut loose from 
that phase of his life ; why should floating things 
come up as impertinent reminders of a shore to 
which he never could return ? 

He meant to see Victoria that night at the theater, 
but as the hours wore on, emotion grew to the limits 
of endurance, urging him to seek her out before. 
It made no vital difference, he told himself, whether 
he saw her a few hours earlier or later. This, the 
conviction born of passion, denied, making both their 
lives seem to depend on it. Consequently, the early 
afternoon found him at Birchwood, where he had little 
trouble in locating the manager's house. 

The servant who answered the bell was very gen- 
uinely surprised at his questions. No, Miss Landor
