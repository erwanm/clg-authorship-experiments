the human spirit. Not only do the pages 
of its history rouse the heart to quicker 
pulsations by their review of the days 
when there were giants, but even the 
face of nature seems here significant. 
Devonshire may be "relaxing" ,as the 
neighbors of Bow Bells declare, with 
fine and almost depreciatory inflection, 
but nevertheless every breath within its 
borders inevitably exhilarates all who 
love a hero. The English Midlands 
spread out into a fair garden, beautified 
by the hand of man, and gaining grace 
from his necessities. Devonshire is 
all warm luxuriance, rolling waste, and 
stormy breaker. Its moorland wastes 
spread on and on, clothed only by coarse 
grass, heath, and furze; but its clefts 
and chasms are enriched by a marvelous 
fern growth, and cooled by clear moun- 
tain streams holding a multitude of fish 
within their limpid shallows. Dartmoor, 
like Salisbury Plain, is one of nature's 
high altars, to be approached with rever- 
ence and dread. A broad expanse, waste 
and wonderful, it lies like a sea caught 
in commotion and fixed in everlasting re- 
 

pose. The touch of cultivation has never 
disturbed its bosom, yet is it a store- 
house of varied wealth. The antiquary- 
may ponder long, unsatisfied, over its 
gigantic mounds and rocky remains, the 
fisherman fill his creel from its waters, 
and countless sheep nibble the unfenced 
pasturage ; but he whom it most delights 
is the pilgrim who fares along its ways, 
mindless of aught save shifting cloud 
beauties and the outline of the billow- 
ing hills. What treasure-house of form 
and color can match the English sky.? 
Taken at its sunniest, here arches no 
crystal vault of blue, but one diversified 
by an ever-changeful pageant made from 
sunlit feather-down and clouds the color 
of a dove's gray wing, — glorified, never- 
theless, by sapphire intervales. Such a 
procession of airy loveliness awakens a 
wondrous sympathy in Dartmoor below. 
Over its tors sweep the shadows, chased 
by a light that turns the heather to rose, 
and transforms the coarse grass to a 
fabric of warm yellow. One hollow lies 
scowling in darkness ; and lo ! beside it 
a hill smiles, and then laughs outright 
under a golden shaft of sun. 

My own course over the moor led from 
 

the little village of Chagford to Tavi- 
stock, thence to seek Plymouth; and 
when I set foot in that historic town, I 
felt the tightening of Kingsley's grasp 
upon my hand. "Come,'' he seemed 
to say; "here was set the tiny stage 
whereon great parts were played, as if 
only Olympus were to be auditor and 
judge. Come, and keep reverent silence ; 
read and remember ! '' 

Plymouth is a town born for the per- 
petual flaunting of England's glory. It 
sits in well-defended pride, looking calm- 
ly over the waves which are Britannia's 
own, and saying in every line of wall 
and fortress, "Behold my impregnable 
strength ! " Should you, on arriving 
there, confide to some inhabitant your 
desire for a pleasant walk, he will say 
substantially although not perhaps in the 
eccentric diction of one kindly woman, 
" Oh, the 'O, my lady, — you must go to 
the 'O ! '' Half a mile from the station 
brings one to this Hoe, or highest part 
of the esplanade and pleasure-grounds 
bordering the water, and themselves 
locked in a wonder of stone outwork and 
coping. Straight across the sound to the 
south runs the breakwater, binding the 
 

waves in such beneficent yet stony fetters 
that they lie tranquil and hospitable be- 
fore the incoming mariner. Fourteen 
miles out stands the Eddystone Light- 
house, on the site of an earlier triumph 
of engineering, at whose firmness even 
its great projector, Smeaton, may have 
wondered, as morning after morning he 
climbed the Hoe, to exult as he found 
the tower still piercing the sunrise mist. 
The tale of the Eddystone Light has 
been one of varied tragedy. The first 
lighthouse erected there was washed 
away, and the second burned. Smea- 
ton's stood the shock of wind and water 
for over a century, and then, having been 
removed on account of its insecure base, 
and replaced by the present structure, 
was set up on the green-carpeted Hoe, 
a perpetually honored pensioner. Com- 
panioned by it, and overlooking fortress 
and wave, stands, counterfeited in bronze, 
the hero of the deep, the scourge of 
Spain, Sir Francis Drake, about whose 
memory clings to-day a legendary glory, 
which, recited by old Devon dames at 
the hour when the thoughts of kid and 
old woman turn homeward, brings a 
parlous creeping along the spine even in 
 

such as are able to summon also that 
expression known in the older novels as 
"a skeptical smile." Who can wonder, 
after reading Drake's exploits, that Spain 
held him to be no man, but devil ? He 
had a soul perpetually drunken with be- 
lief in self and a passionate love of action ; 
he was one of those who do, not the 
things they can, but what they will ; and 
more than all, like Napoleon in his hap- 
pier days, he had a star. His actual 
doings read like fairy tales ; but better 
than them all do I love the folk-lore indi- 
cating his place in the common mind, 
that afterglow sure to depict a vanished 
sunset more faithfully than painter's 
brush or poet's pen. Was she not a 
prudent dame, the Spanish favorite who 
refused to join a water-party with Philip 
of Spain, even at the risk of offending 
her sovereign, because she feared "El 
Draque," that water dragon who, by force 
of his magic arts, might be an)rwhere 
at a moment's notice, — now in Europe, 
now in Prester John's dominions? It 
was he who brought water down into 
Plymouth from clear mountain sources, 
by the simple process of obtaining a 
grant from the queen, and the good-will 
 

of certain influential persons through 
whose ground it must run. But did such 
commonplace means suffice for the popu- 
lar imagination ? Not in the least. Sir 
Francis mounted his great black horse, 
and rode up into Dartmoor. There he 
found a spring by Sheep's Tor. He 
beckoned, it followed, and, as he' galloped 
down into Plymouth town, the stream, a 
docile Jill, came tumbling after. 

" And fine would have been the Diver- 
sion," says a worthy chronicler, "when 
the Water was brought somewhere near 
the Town, to have seen how the Mayor 
and his Brethren, in their Formalities, 
went out to meet it, and bid it welcome 
hither; and that being thus met, they 
all returned together, the Gentlemen of 
the Corporation accompanied with Sir 
Francis Drake, walked before, and the 
Stream followed after into the Town, 
where it has continued to do ever since." 

Though some give Sir Francis the 
mere credit of taking the contract for the 
waterworks, which had been previously 
planned by others, he is never forgotten 
in his capacity of Plymouth's cup-bearer. 
One loving custom of the town is its 
annual survey of the watercourse, amply 
 

described in a programme of the cere- 
mony, dated July, 1891, — a bit of paper 
calculated, as it lies in the hand, to set 
one to dreaming of that heroic past with 
which it forms a solid link. 

" At the Head Weir," says this quaint 
and delightful memorial, " the party be- 
ing assembled, a Goblet filled with pure 
Water taken from the Weir by the Sur- 
veyor is handed by him to the Chairman 
of the Water Committee, who presents
