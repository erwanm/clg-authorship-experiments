LETTER FROM EVA TO HARRY'S MOTHER.


My Dear Mother: I sit down to write to you with a heart full of the
strangest feelings and experiences. I feel as if I had been out in
some other world and been brought back again; and now I hardly know
myself or where I am. You know I wrote you all about Maggie, and her
leaving us, and poor Mary's trouble about her, and how she had been
since seen in a very bad neighborhood: I promised Mary faithfully that
I would go after her; and so, after all our Christmas labors were
over, Harry and I went on a midnight excursion with Mr. James, the
Methodist minister, who has started the mission there.

It seemed to me very strange that a minister could have access to
all those places where he proposed to take us, and see all that was
going on without insult or danger but he told me that he was in the
constant habit of passing through the dance-houses, and talking with
the people who kept them, and that he had never met with any rudeness
or incivility.

He told us that in the very center of this worst district of New
York, among drinking saloons and dance-houses, a few Christian
people had bought a house in which they had established a mission
family, with a room which they use for a chapel; and they hold weekly
prayer-meetings, and seek to draw in the wretched people there.

On this evening, he said, they were about to give a midnight supper at
the Home to any poor houseless wanderer whom they could find in those
wretched streets, or who hung about the drinking-saloons.

"Our only hope in this mission," he said, "is to make these wretched
people feel that we really are their friends and seek their good;
and, in order to do this, we must do something for them that they
can understand. They can all understand a good supper, when they are
lying about cold and hungry and homeless, on a stinging cold night
like this; and we don't begin to talk to them till we have warmed and
fed them. It surprises them to have us take all this trouble to do
them good; it awakens their curiosity; they wonder what we do it for,
and then, when we tell them it is because we are Christians, and love
them, and want to save them, they believe us. After that, they are
willing to come to our meetings, and attend to what we say."

Now, this seemed to me good philosophy, but I could not help saying:
"Dear Mr. James, how could you have the courage to begin a mission
in such a dreadful place; and how can you have any hope of saving
such people?" And he answered: "With God, all things are possible.
That was what Christ came for--to seek and save the lost. The Good
Shepherd," he said, "leaves the ninety and nine safe sheep in the
fold, and goes after one that is lost until he finds it." I asked
him who supported the Home, and he said it was supported by God, in
answer to prayer; that they made no public solicitation; had nobody
pledged to help them; but that contributions were constantly coming
in from one Christian person or another, as they needed them; that
the superintendent and matron of the Home had no stated salary, and
devoted themselves to the work in the same faith that the food and
raiment needed would be found for them; and so far it had not failed.

All this seemed very strange to me. It seemed a sort of literal
rendering of some of the things in the Bible that we pass over as
having no very definite meaning. Mr. James seemed so quiet, so
assured, so calm and unexcited, that one couldn't help believing him.

It seemed a great way that we rode, in parts of the city that I never
saw before, in streets whose names were unknown to me, till finally we
alighted before a plain house in a street full of drinking-saloons.
As we drove up, we heard the sound of hymn-singing, and looked into a
long room set with benches which seemed full of people. We stopped a
moment to listen to the words of an old Methodist hymn;

    "Come, ye weary, heavy-laden,
    Lost and ruined by the fall,
    If you tarry till you're better,
    You will never come at all.
        Not the righteous--
        Sinners, Jesus came to call.

    "Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome,
    God's free bounty glorify.
    True belief and true repentance,
    Every grace that brings us nigh,
        Without money,
        Come to Jesus Christ and buy."

It was the last hymn, and they were about breaking up as we went into
the house. This building, Mr. James told us, used to be a rat-pit,
where the lowest, vilest, and most brutal kinds of sport were going
on. It used to be, he said, foul and filthy, physically as well as
morally; but scrubbing and paint and whitewash had transformed it
into a comfortable home. There was a neat sitting-room, carpeted
and comfortably furnished, a dining-room, a pantry stocked with
serviceable china, a workroom with two or three sewing-machines, and
a kitchen, from which at this moment came a most appetizing smell
of the soup which was preparing for the midnight supper. Above, were
dormitories, in which were lodging about twenty girls, who had fled to
this refuge to learn a new life. They had known the depth of sin and
the bitterness of punishment, had been spurned, disgraced and outcast.
Some of them had been at Blackwell's Island--on the street--in the
very gutter--and now, here they were, as I saw some of them, decently
and modestly dressed, and busy preparing for the supper. When I looked
at them setting the tables, or busy about their cooking, they seemed
so cheerful and respectable, I could scarcely believe that they had
been so degraded. A portion of them only were detailed for the night
service; the others had come up from the chapel and were going to bed
in the dormitories, and we heard them singing a hymn before retiring.
It was very affecting to me--the sound of that hymn, and the thought
of so peaceful a home in the midst of this dreadful neighborhood. Mr.
James introduced us to the man and his wife who take charge of the
family. They are converts--the fruits of these labors. He was once a
singer, and connected with a drinking-saloon, but was now giving his
whole time and strength to this work, in which he had all the more
success because he had so thorough an experience and knowledge of
the people to be reached. We were invited to sit down to a supper in
the dining-room, for Mr. James said we should be out so late before
returning home that we should need something to sustain us. So we
took some of the soup which was preparing for the midnight supper,
and very nice and refreshing we found it. After this, we went out
with Mr. James and the superintendent, to go through the saloons
and dance-houses and drinking places, and to distribute tickets of
invitation to the supper. What we saw seems now to me like a dream.
I had heard that such things were, but never before did I see them.
We went from one place to another, and always the same features--a
dancing-room, with girls and women dressed and ornamented, sitting
round waiting for partners; men of all sorts walking in and surveying
and choosing from among them and dancing, and, afterwards or before,
going with them to the bar to drink. Many of these girls looked young
and comparatively fresh; their dresses were cut very low, so that I
blushed for them through my veil. I clung tight to Harry's arm, and
asked myself where I was, as I moved round among them. Nobody noticed
us. Everybody seemed to have a right to be there, and see what they
could.

I remember one large building of two or three stories, with larger
halls below, all lighted up, with dancing and drinking going on,
and throngs and throngs of men, old and young, pouring and crowding
through it. These tawdrily bedizened, wretched girls and women seemed
to me such a sorrow and disgrace to womanhood and to Christianity
that my very heart sunk, as I walked among them. I felt as if I could
have cried for their disgrace. Yet nobody said a word to us. All the
keepers of the places seemed to know Mr. James and the superintendent.
He spoke to them all kindly and politely, and they answered with the
same civility. In one or two of the saloons, the superintendent asked
leave to sing a song, which was granted, and he sung the hymn that
begins:

    "I love to tell the story
      Of unseen things above,
    Of Jesus and his glory,
      Of Jesus and his love;
    I love to tell the story--
      It did so much for me--
    And that is just the reason
      I tell it unto thee."

At another place, he sung "Home, sweet home," and I thought I saw many
faces that looked sad. Either our presence was an embarrassment, or
for some other reason it seemed to me there was no real gaiety, and
that the dancing and the keeping up of a show of hilarity were all
heavy work.

There seems, however, to be a gradation in these dreadful places.
Besides these which were furnished with some show and pretension,
there were cellars where the same sort of thing was going on--dancing
and drinking, and women set to be the tempters of men. We saw
miserable creatures standing out on the sidewalk, to urge the
passers-by to come into these cellars. It was pitiful, heart-breaking
to see.

But the lowest, the most dreadful of all, was what they called the
bucket shops. There the vilest of liquors are mixed in buckets and
sold to wretched, crazed people who have fallen so low that they
cannot get anything better. It is the lowest depth of the dreadful
deep.

Oh, those bucket shops! Never shall I forget the poor, forlorn,
forsaken-looking creatures, both men and women, that I saw there.
They seemed crouching in from the cold--hanging about, or wandering
uncertainly up and down. Mr. James spoke to many of them, as if he
knew them, kindly and sorrowfully. "This is a hard way you are going,"
he said to one. "Ar'n't you most tired of it?" "Well," he said to
another poor creature, "when you have gone as far as you can, and come
to the end, and nobody will have you, and nobody do anything for you,
then come to us, and we'll take you in."

During all this time, and in all these places, the Superintendent, who
seemed to have a personal knowledge of many of those among whom he
was moving, was busy distributing his tickets of invitation to the
supper. He knew where the utterly lost and abandoned ones were most to
be found, and to them he gave most regard.

But as yet, though I looked with anxious eyes, I had seen nothing of
Maggie. I spoke to Mr. James at last, and he said, "We have not yet
visited Mother Moggs's establishment, where she was said to be. We are
going there now."

"Mother Moggs is a character in her way," he told us. "She has always
treated me with perfect respect and politeness, because I have shown
the same to her. She seems at first view like any other decent woman,
but she is one that, if she were roused, would be as prompt with knife
and pistol as any man in these streets." As he said this, we turned
