leisure to be kind. 

" I wish you would tell me," pleaded Yorke, 



 

" if you don't mind, how you came to have such 
an uncommon supply of initials. I 've never even 
heard your name." 

" Atalanta," said the doctor, looking up pleas 
antly from the powder-paper she was folding with 
mathematical precision. He always liked to see 
her fold powders ; it brought all the little delicate 
motions of her firm hands into play. 

" Ah, the apple-blossom ! " said Yorke impul 
sively. The powder-paper remained for an in 
stant motionless in Doctor 's Zay 's hand ; she 
turned her head slightly in the attitude of atten 
tion towards the hair-cloth sofa. He thought, 
" She meant to do it." Her eyes were bent. He 
thought for a moment he could see the mischief 
beneath the lids, and that she would ripple into 
frolic over his daring speech, like any other young 
lady. Nothing of the sort happened. The doc 
tor 's countenance presented a strictly scientific 
basis. " She dropped it by accident," said Yorke. 

He contented himself with observing that it 
was an unusual name. 

" I had a mother who liked the name," pro 
ceeded the doctor, leaning back in her chair, and 
looking over his head out of the window into the 
young June day. " When I was a baby she had 
this fancy for romantic names. She called me 



 

Zaiclee, to begin with. Then she happened on 
this. She always said it was cruelty to infants 
to impose names on them about which they were 
never consulted, and I should have my choice of 
either. I dropped the first, till I came here to 
practice. Then I had to make some compromise 
with fate as regarded Dr. Adoniram. There was 
something absurd in seeing Atalanta on a Down 
East doctor 's shingle, I have known women do 
such things in that way ! I had a classmate who 
took out her diploma in the name of Oubbie Smith, 
M. D. ; and there was one who was let loose upon 
a defenseless public as Dr. Teasie Trial. So I 
had recourse to the discarded initial. My patients 
have made a pretty use of it. I rather like it, my 
self." 

She gave that ominous snap to the elastic on 
the well-worn green morocco medicine-case which 
had become philosophically associated in the in 
valid 's mind with the cessation of a pleasure. She 
was going. He hurried to say, 

" Do you object to telling me how you came to 
settle in this village ? There are so many things 
I should like to ask. I never knew a lady physi 
cian before. The whole thing interests me. So 
it will my mother ; she is familiar with such sub 
jects. I believe she once consulted a doctress 
herself. I shall tell her about you when I get a little 
better; when it is too late to worry." 

" I will give you any facts about professional 
women that may interest you, certainly," replied 
the doctor, rising, " when I have time." 

" You never have time ! " cried the patient. 

"Have I neglected you, Mr. Yorke?" she asked, 
coloring slightly ; her color became her. She wore 
a black dress that day, of almost extravagantly 
fine cashmere ; she was always well dressed. There 
was a carmine ribbon around her high, close collar 
of immaculate linen. The fastidious sick man 
wondered where this Down East doctress had her 
origin. 


" You have asked me all sorts of personal ques 
tions," he went on, with his masculine insistence. 
" You know all about me." 

"It is my business," said the doctor, coldly, "to 
know all about you." 

" In other words, it is none of mine to feel the 
faintest human curiosity in a scientific fact like 
yourself. Y^ou are candid, Doctor Lloyd." 

" And you are nervous, Mr. Yorke. Good- 
morning. I will send Mrs. Butterwell to read to 
you." 

He held her to her promise, however ; and the 
next time she came he returned to the subject. It 



 

was her mood to be tolerant of him that after 
noon ; indeed, she was tolerant of everything. She 
had just brought a patient triumphantly through 
a mortal attack of erysipelas : she had been a good 
deal worn by the case for some time ; now her 
cruel care had slipped radiantly from her young 
shoulders. He had never heard her talk so nat 
urally, so much like other women. It seemed to 
him at the moment as if she were really com 
municative. Afterwards, he remembered how lit 
tle she had said ; and began to analyze the fine 
reserve upon which all her ease had been poised, 
like the pendulum of a golden clock upon its axis. 
She told him that she had been in active practice 
for four years ; that she was originally a Bangor 
girl ; that she came to Sherman for a complexity 
of reasons which might not interest him. She 
paused there, as if there were nothing more to be 
said. 

." But where did yea get your medical educa 
tion ? " asked Yorke. " I don't even know where 
such things are to be had." 

" At New York, Zurich, and Vienna." 
" But why did you select this wilderness to 
bury yourself in ? " lie repeated, his surprise over 
coming his civility. "You who had seen Is it 
possible you ha,ve been abroad ? " 



 

She laughed outright at this, but did not other 
wise comment upon it. A fine, good-natured 
scorn hovered over and seemed to be about to light 
upon her. He perceived at what a disadvantage 
he was showing himself; he might as well have 
said point-blank, "I thought you a crude, rural 
agitator." He felt his cheeks burn with the quick 
fever of illness, while she went on indulgently to 
say, 

" I used to come here summers, once. I knew 
Mi-s. Butterwell and some people here. I must 
make my blunders somewhere. And then I had 
learned how terrible is the need of a woman by 
women, in country towns. One does not forget 
such things, who ever understands them. There 
is refinement and suffering and waste of delicate 
life enough in these desolate places to fill a circle 
in the Inferno. You do not know!" she said, 
with rare impetuousness. No one knows, Mr. 
Yorke, but the woman healer." 

" What led you to see it ? How came you to 
want to see it ? " he asked, reverently. " How 
came you to make such a sacrifice of yourself ? 
such a young, bright life as yours ! I cannot un 
derstand it." 

She did not answer him at once ; and when he 
raised his eyes he perceived that her own swam 



 

with sudden tears. She held them back royally, 
commanded herself, and answered in a very low 
voice : 

" It was owing to my mother. She had a 
painful illness. There were only we two. I took 
care of her through it all. She spent that last 
summer here in Sherman, it was cool here. 
She suffered so from the hot weather ! My mother 
was greatly comforted, during a part of her ill 
ness, by the services of a woman doctor in Boston. 
There was one when we were in Pnris, too, who 
helped her. I said, When she is gone, I will do 
as much for some one else 's mother." 

Waldo Yorke was lying with his hands clasped 
behind his head, his thin face upturned towards
