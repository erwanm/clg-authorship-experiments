" Jupiter ! " Edmund Ludlow exclaimed. " I hope she isn't 
going to develop any more ! " 

" If I were not sure you only said that for argument, I should 
feel very badly," his wife replied. " But you know you love her." 

" Do you know I love you ? " the young man said, jocosely, to 
Isabel a little later, while he brushed his hat. 

" I am sure I don't care whether you do or not ! " exclaimed 
the girl, whose voice and smile, however, were sweeter than the 
words she uttered. 

" Oh, she feels so grand since Mrs. Touchett's visit," said 
her sister. 

But Isabel challenged this assertion with a good deal of 
seriousness. 

" You must not say that, Lily. I don't feel grand at all." 

" I am sure there is no harm," said the conciliatory Lily. 

" Ah, but there is nothing in Mrs. Touchett's visit to make 
one feel grand." 

" Oh," exclaimed Ludlow, " she is grander than ever ! " 

" Whenever I feel grand," said the girl, " it will be for a better 
reason." 

Whether she felt grand or no, she at any rate felt busy ; busy, 
I mean, with her thoughts. Left to herself for the evening, she 
sat awhile under the lamp, with empty hands, heedless of her 
usual avocations. Then she rose and moved about the room, 
and from one room to another, preferring the places where the 
vague lamplight expired. She was restless, and even excited ; 
at moments she trembled a little. She felt that something had 
happened to her of which the importance was out of proportion 
to its appearance ; there had really been a change in her life. 
What it would bring with it was as yet extremely indefinite  
but Isabel was in a situation which gave a value to any change. 
She had a desire to leave the past behind her, and, as she said 



 

to herself,to begin afresh. This desire, indeed, was not a birth 
of the present occasion; it was as familiar as the sound of the 
rain upon the window, and it had led to her beginning afresh a 
great many times. She closed her eyes as she sat in one of the 
dusky corners of the quiet parlour ; but it was not with a desire 
to take a nap. On the contrary, it was because she felt too 
wide-awake, and wished to check the sense of seeing too many 
things at once. Her imagination was by habit ridiculously 
active ; if the door were not opened to it, it jumped out of the 
window. She was not accustomed, indeed, to keep it behind 
bolts ; and, at important moments, when she would have been 
thankful to make use of her judgment alone, she paid the penalty 
of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing 
without judging. At present, with her sense that the note of 
change had been struck, came gradually a host of images of the 
things she was leaving behind her. The years and hours of her 
life came back to her, and for a long time, in a stillness  broken 
only by the ticking of the big bronze clock, she passed them in 
review. It had been a very happy life and she had been a very 
fortunate girl this was the truth that seemed to emerge most 
vividly. She had had the best of everything, and in a world 
in which the circumstances of so many people made them unen- 
viable, it was an advantage never to have known anything 
particularly disagreeable. It appeared to Isabel that the disa- 
greeable had been even too absent from her knowledge, for she 
had gathered from her acquaintance with literature that it was 
often a source of interest;, and even of instruction. Her father 
had kept it away from her her handsome, much-loved father, 
who always had such an aversion to it. It was a great good 
fortune to have been his daughter ; Isabel was even proud of her 
parentage. Since his death she had gathered a vague impression 
that he turned his brighter side to his children, and that he had 
not eluded discomfort quite so much in practice as in aspiration. 
But this only made her tenderness for 'him greater ; it was 
scarcely even painful to have to think that he was too generous, 
too good-natured, too indifferent to sordid considerations. Many 
persons thought that he carried this indiiference too far; 
especially the large number of those to whom he owed money. 
Of their opinions, Isabel was never very definitely informed ; 
but it may interest the reader to know that, while they admitted 
that the late Mr. Archer had a remarkably handsome head and a 
very taking manner (indeed, as one of them had said, he was 
always taking something), they declared that he had made a 



 

very poor use of his life. He had squandered a substantial 
fortune, he had been deplorably convivial, he was known to 
have gambled freely. A few very harsh critics went so far as to 
say that he had not even brought up his daughters. They had 
had no regular education and no permanent home ; they had 
been at once spoiled and neglected ; they had lived with nurse- 
maids and governesses (usually very bad ones), or had been sent 
to strange schools kept by foreigners, from which, at the end of 
a month, they had been removed in tears. This view of the 
matter would have excited Isabel's indignation, for to her own 
sense her opportunities had been abundant. Even when her 
father had left his daughters for three months at Neufchatel 
with a French bonne, who eloped with a Russian nobleman, 
staying at the same hotel even in this irregular situation (an 
incident of the girl's eleventh year) she had been neither fright- 
ened nor ashamed, but had thought it a picturesque episode in a 
liberal education. Her father had a large way of looking at life, 
of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency of 
conduct had been only a proof. He wished his daughters, even 
as children, to see as much of the world as possible ; and it was 
for this purpose that, before Isabel was fourteen, he had trans- 
ported them three times across the Atlantic, giving them on each 
occasion, however, but a few months' view of foreign lands ; a 
course which had whetted our heroine's curiosity without 
enabling her to satisfy it. She ought to have been a partisan 
of her father, for among his three daughters she was quite his 
favourite, and in his last days his general willingness to take 
leave of a world in which the difficulty of doing as one liked 
appeared to increase as one grew older v was sensibly modified by 
the pain of separation from his clever, his superior, his remark- 
able girl. Later, when the journeys to Europe ceased, he still 
had shown his children all sorts of indulgence, and if he had 
been troubled about money-matters, nothing ever disturbed their 
irreflective consciousness of many possessions. Isabel, though 
she danced very well, had not the recollection of having been in 
New York a successful member of the choregraphic circle ; her 
sister Edith was, as every one said, so very much more popular. 
Edith was so striking an example of success that Isabel could 
have no illusions as to what constituted this advantage, or as to 
the moderate character of her own triumphs. Nineteen persons 
out of twenty (including the younger sister herself) pronounced 
Edith infinitely the prettier of the two ; but the twentieth, 
besides reversing this judgment, had the entertainment of thinking 



 

all the others a parcel of fools. Isabel had in the depths of 
her nature an. even more unquenchable desire to please than 
Edith ; but the depths of this young lady's nature were a very 
out-of-the-way place, between which and the surface communi- 
cation was interrupted by a dozen capricious forces. She saw 
the young men who came in large numbers to see her sister ; 
but as a general thing they were afraid of her; they had a 
belief that some special preparation was required for talking 
with her. Her reputation of reading a great deal hung about 
her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic ; it was 
supposed to engender difficult questions, and to keep the conver- 
sation at a low temperature. The poor girl liked to be thought 
clever, but she hated to be thought bookish ; she used to read in 
secret, and, though her memory was excellent, to abstain from 
quotation. She had a great desire for knowledge, but she really 
preferred almost any source of information to the printed page; 
she had an immense curiosity about life, and was constantly 
staring and wondering. She carried within herself a great fund 
of life, and her deepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity 
between the movements of her own heart and the agitations of 
the world. For this reason she was fond of seeing great crowds 
and large stretches of country, of reading about revolutions and 
wars, of looking at historical pictures a class of efforts to which 
she had often gone so far as to forgive much bad painting for 
the sake of the subject. While the Civil War went on, she was 
still a very young girl ; but she passed months of this long 
period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which she 
felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred almost 
indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course 
the circumspection of the local youth had never gone the 
length of making her a social proscript; for the proportion of 
those whose hearts, as they approached her, beat only just fast 
enough to make it a sensible pleasure, was sufficient to redeem 
her maidenly career from failure. She had had everything that 
a girl could have : kindness, admiration, flattery, bouquets, the 
sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she 
lived in, abundant opportunity for dancing, the latest publica- 
tions, plenty of new dresses, the London Spectator, and a glimpse 
of contemporary aesthetics. 

These things now, as memory played over them, resolved 
themselves into a multitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten 
things came back to her; many others, which she had lately 
thought of great moment, dropped out of sight. The result was 
kaleidoscopic ; but the movement of the instrument was checked 



 

at last by the servant's coming in with the name of a gentleman. 
The name of the gentleman was Caspar Goodwood ; he was a 
straight young man from Boston, who had known Miss Archer for 
the last twelvemonth, and who, thinking her the most beautiful 
young woman of her time, had pronounced the time, according to
