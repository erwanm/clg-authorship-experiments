and at the point of death, Darius was brave, as brave 
men are, to the very last. He would indeed have 
called for help now, but there was no breath in him. 
He still gazed fearlessly into the eyes of his terrible 
conqueror. His voice came in a hoarse whisper. 

" I fear not death. Slay on if thou wilt — thou — 
hast — conquered." 

Nehushta had come near. She trembled now that 
the fight was over, and looked anxiously to the heavy 
curtains of the tent-door. 

" Tell him," she whispered to Zoroaster, " that you 
will spare him if he will do no harm to you, nor to 
me." 

" Spare him ! " echoed Zoroaster scornfully. " He 
is almost dead now — why should I spare him ? " 

" For my sake, beloved," answered Nehushta, with 
a sudden and passionate gesture of entreaty. " He is 
the king — he speaks truth: if he says he will not 
harm you, trust him." 



 

" If I slay thee not, swear thou wilt not harm me 
nor Nehushta," said Zoroaster, removing one knee 
from the chest of his adversary. 

" By the name of Auramazda," gasped Darius, " I 
will not harm thee nor her." 

" It is well," said Zoroaster. " I will let thee go. 
And as for taking her to be thy wife, thou mayest 
ask her if she will wed thee," he added. He rose 
and helped the king to his feet. Darius shook him- 
self and breathed hard for a few minutes. He felt 
his limbs as a man might do who had fallen from his 
horse, and then he sat down upon the chair, and 
broke into a loud laugh. 

Darius was well known to all Persia and Media 
before the events of the last two months, and such 
was his reputation for abiding by his promise that he 
was universally trusted by those about him. Zoroaster had known him also, and he remembered his easy 
familiarity and love of jesting, so that even when he 
held the king at such vantage that he might have 
killed him by a little additional pressure of his weight, 
he felt not the least hesitation in accepting his prom- 
ise of safety. But remembering what a stake had 
been played for in the desperate issue, he could not 
join in the king's laugh. He stood silently apart, and 
looked at Nehushta who leaned back against the tent- 
pole in violent agitation ; her hands wringing each 
other beneath her long sleeves, and her eyes turning 
from the king to Zoroaster, and back again to the 
king, in evident distress and fear. 

"Thou hast a mighty arm, Zoroaster," cried Da- 
rius, as his laughter subsided, " and thou hadst well- 



 

nigh made an end of the Great King and of Persia, 
Media, Babylon and Egypt in thy grip." 

'' Let the king pardon his servant," answered Zo- 
roaster, " if his knee was heavy and his hand strong. 
Had not the king slipped upon the spilt wine, his 
servant would have been thrown down." 

" And thou wouldst have been crucified at dawn," 
added Darius, laughing again. " It is well for thee 
that I am Darius and not Cambyses, or thou wouldst 
not be standing there before me while my guards are 
gossiping idly in the road. Give me a cup of wine 
since thou hast spared my life ! " Again the king 
laughed as though his sides would break. Zoroaster 
hastily filled another goblet and offered it, kneeling 
before the monarch. Darius paused before he took 
the cup, and looked at the kneeling warrior's pale 
proud face. Then he spoke and his voice dropped 
to a less mirthful key, as he laid his hand on Zo- 
roaster's shoulder. 

"I love thee, prince," he said, "because thou art 
stronger than I ; and as brave and more merciful. 
Therefore shalt thou stand ever at my right hand 
and I will trust thee with my life in thy hand. And 
in pledge hereunto I put my own chain of gold about 
thy neck, and I drink this cup to thee ; and whosoever shall harm a hair of thine head shall perish in 
torments." 

The king drank ; and Zoroaster, overcome with 
genuine admiration of the great soul that could so 
easily forgive so dire an offence, bent and embraced 
the king's knees in token of adherence, and as a seal 
of that friendship which was never to be broken until 
death parted the two men asunder. 



 

Then they arose, and at Zoroaster's order, the 
princess's litter was brought, and leaving the en- 
campment to follow after them, they went up to the 
palace. Nehushta was borne between the litters of 
her women and her slaves on foot, but Zoroaster 
mounted his horse and rode slowly and in silence by 
the right side of the Great King. 



 



CHAPTER VI. 

Athwart the gleaming colonnades of the eastern 
balcony, the early morning sun shone brightly, and 
all the shadows of the white marble cornices and 
capitals and jutting frieze work were blue with the 
reflection of the cloudless sky. The swallows now 
and then shot in under the overhanging roof and 
flew up and down the covered terrace ; then with a 
quick rush, they sped forth again into the dancing 
sunshine with clean sudden sweep, as when a sharp 
sword is whirled in the air. Far below, the soft mist 
of the dawn still lay upon the city, whence the distant cries of the water-carriers and fruitsellers came 
echoing up from the waking streets, the call of the 
women to one another from the housetops, and now 
and then the neighing of a horse far out upon the 
meadows ; while the fleet swallows circled over all in 
swift wide curves, with a silvery fresh stream of unceasing twittering music. 

Zoroaster paced the balcony alone. He was fully 
armed, with his helmet upon his head ; the crest of 
the winged wheels was replaced by the ensign Darius 
had chosen for himself, — the half-figure of a likeness 
of the king with long straight wings on either side, 
of w^rought gold and very fine workmanship. The 
long purple mantle hung to his heels and the royal 
chain of gold was about his neck. As he walked the 



 

gilded leather of liis shoes was reflected in the pol- 
ished marble pavement and he trod cautiously, for 
the clean surface was slippery as the face of a mirror. 
At one end of the terrace a stairway led down to the 
lower story of the palace, and at the other end a high 
square door was masked by a heavy curtain of rich 
purple and gold stuff, that fell in thick folds to the 
glassy floor. Each time his walk brought him to this 
end Zoroaster paused, as though expecting that some 
one should come out. But as it generally happens 
when a man is waiting for something or some one 
that the object or person appears unexpectedly, so it 
occurred that as he turned back from the staircase 
towards the curtain, he saw that some one had already 
advanced half the length of the balcony to meet 
him — and it was not the person for whom he was 
looking. 

At first, he was dazzled for a moment, but his 
memory served him instantly and he recognised the 
face and form of a woman he had known and often seen before. She was not tall, but so perfectly proportioned that it was impossible to wish that she were 
taller. Her close tunic of palest blue, bordered with 
a gold embroidery at the neck, betrayed the matchless 
symmetry of her figure, the unspeakable grace of de- 
velopment of a woman in the fullest bloom of beauty. 
From her knees to her feet, her under tunic showed 
the purple and white bands that none but the king 
might wear, and which even for the queen was an undue assumption of the royal insignia. But Zoroaster 
did not look at her dress, nor at her mantle of royal 
sea-purple, nor at the marvellous white hands that 



 

held together a written scroll. His eyes rested on 
her face, and he stood still where he was. 

He knew those straight and perfect features, not 
large nor heavy, but of such rare mould and faultless 
type as man has not seen since, neither will see. The 
perfect curve of the fresh mouth ; the white forward 
chin with its sunk depression in the midst ; the deep-set, blue eyes and the straight pencilled brows ; the 
broad smooth forehead and the tiny ear half hidden
