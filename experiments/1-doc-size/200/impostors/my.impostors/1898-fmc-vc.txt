Gilbert stood still, for they did not make way for 
him. 

" Sir Gilbert," said Sanzay, " I am here to keep 
the Queen's door, and though we be friends, I shall 
not let you pass while I live, if you mean her any 
violence." 

"Sir," answered Gilbert, "I come unarmed, as 
you see, and by no means to fight with you. I pray 





you, sir, go in and tell the Queen that I am without, 
and have her men with me, and would speak with 
her for her safety." 

Then Sanzay bade his men stand back, and the 
knights and men-at-arms crowded the vestibule, 
while he went in ; and immediately he came out 
again, with a clear face. 

" The Queen is alone, and bids the Guide of 
Aquitaine pass," he said. 

All stood aside, and he, taller than they, and 
grave and keen of face, went in ; and the door was 
closed behind him, and within that there was a 
heavy Eastern curtain, so that no voices could be 
heard from one side to the other. 

Eleanor sat under the warm lamplight, near the 
open window, for the night was warm. Her head 
was uncovered, her russet-golden hair fell in great 
waves upon her shoulders and to the ground behind 
her chair, and she wore no mantle, but only a close- 
fitting gown of cream-white silk with deep em- 
broideries of silver and pearls. She was very 
beautiful, but very pale, and her eyes were veiled. 
Gilbert came and stood before her, but she did not 
hold out her hand, as he had expected. 

" Why have you come to me ? " she asked after a 
time, looking out at the balcony, and not at him. 

"The King, Madam, has bidden me take you a 
prisoner to him, in order that he may carry you 
away by sea to Ptolemais and to Jerusalem." 

While he was speaking, she slowly turned her face 
to him, and stared at his coldly. 

" And you are come to do as you are bidden, get- 



 

ting admittance to me stealthily, with men of my own 
who have betrayed me ? " 

Gilbert turned white, and then he smiled as he 
answered her. 

"No. I am come to warn your Grace and to 
defend you against all violence, with my life." 

Eleanor's face changed and softened, and again she 
looked out at the balcony. 

"Why should you defend me?" she asked sadly, 
after a pause. " What am I to you, that you should 
fight for me? I sent you out to die — why should 
you wish me to be safe ? " 

"You have been the best friend to me, and the 
kindest, that ever woman was to man." 

"A friend? No. I was never your friend. I 
sent you out to death, because I loved you, and 
trusted that I might see you never again, and that 
you might die honourably for the Cross and your 
vows. Instead, you won glory, and saved us all — 
all but me ! You owe me no thanks for such friend- 
ship." 

She looked at him long, and he was silent. 

" Oh, what a man you are ! " she cried suddenly. 
" What a man ! " 

He blushed like a girl at the praise, for her soul 
was in the words, and her great love for him, the 
only thing in all her life that had ever been above 
herself. 

" What a man you are ! " she said again, more 
softly. " Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Queen, the fair- 
est woman in the world, would give you her soul and 
her body and the hope of her life to come — and you 





are faithful to a poor girl whom you loved when you 
were a boy ! A hundred thousand brave men stand 
by to see me die, and you alone take death by the 
throat and strangle him off, as you would strangle a 
bloodhound, with those hands of yours ! I send you 
out — oh, how selfishly ! — that you may at least 
die bravely for your vow and leave me at sad peace 
with your memory, and you fight through a hell of 
foes and save the King and me and all, and come 
back to me in glory — my Guide of Aquitaine ! " 

She had risen and stood before him, her face dead 
white with passion, and her eyes deep-fired by a love 
that was beyond any telling. And though she would 
not move, her arms went out toward him. 

" How can any woman help loving you ! " she 
cried passionately. 

She sank into her chair again, and covered her face 
with her hands. He stood still a moment, and then 
came and knelt on one knee beside her, resting his 
hand upon the carved arm of her chair. 

"I cannot love you, but in so far as I may be 
faithful to another I give you my whole life," he 
said very gently. 

As he spoke the last words, the curtain of the 
inner apartments was softly raised, and Beatrix 
stood there ; for she had thought that the Queen 
was alone. But she heard not the beginning of the 
speech, and she grew quite cold, and could not speak 
nor go away. 

Eleanor's hands left her face and fell together upon 
Gilbert's right. 

" I have not mine to give," she answered in a low 



 

voice. " It is yours already — and I would that you 
were not English, that I might be your sovereign 
and make you great among men — or that I were 
England's Queen — and that may come to pass, and 
you shall see what I will do for love of you — I 
would marry that boy of the Plantagenets, if it 
could serve you ! " 

"Madam," said Gilbert, "think of your own 
present safety — the King is very angry — " 

" Did I think of your safety when I sent you out 
to lead us? Now if you are here, am I not safe? 
Gilbert — " 

She let her voice caress his name, and her lips 
lingered with it, and she laid her hands upon his 
shoulders. As he knelt beside her — she bent to his 
face. 

" Best and bravest living man " — it was a whisper 
now — " love of my life — heart of my heart — this 
last time — this only once — and then good-by." 

She kissed him on the forehead, and leapt from 
her seat in horror, for there was another voice in the 
room, with a hurt cry. 

"Oh, Gilbert! Gilbert!" 

Beatrix was reeling on her feet, and caught the 
curtain, lest she fall, and her face of agony was still 
turned toward the two, as they stood together. Gil- 
bert sprang forward, when he understood, and caught 
the girl in his arms and brought her to the light, 
trembling like a falling leaf. Then she started in 
his arms and struggled wildly to be free, and twisted 
her neck lest he should kiss her; but he held her 
fast. 





" Beatrix ! You do not understand — you did not 
hear ! " He tried to make her listen to Mm. 

"I heard ! " she cried, still struggling. "I saw ! I 
know ! Let me go — oh, for God's sake, let me go ! "
