Gilbert had never seen anything made to grow in 
such orderly profusion, and when he reached the top 
by narrow steps built against the wall, he found him- 
self treading on a fine white gravel surface on which 
not even a single dead leaf had been allowed to lie, 
and which extended some thirty yards inwards under 
the trees to a straight bank of moss that had a sheen 
like green velvet where the sun fell upon it through 
the parted leaves overhead. Very far away between 
the trunks of the trees there was the gleam of white 
marble walls. 

Gilbert hesitated a little, and then walked slowly 
forward toward the bank. As yet he had seen no 
trace of any living thing in the garden, but as he 
advanced and changed his position he noticed a small 
dash of colour, like the corner of a dark blue cloak, 
beside the trunk of one of the larger trees. Some one 
was sitting on the other side, and he moved cau- 
tiously and almost noiselessly till he saw that the 
person was a lady, seated on the ground and absorbed 
in a book. He did not remember to have seen more 
than two or three women reading in all his life, 
and one of them was Queen Eleanor; another was 
Beatrix, who, as a lonely child in the solitude 
of her father's castle, had acquired some learning 
from the chaplain, and delighted in spelling out the 
few manuscripts in her father's possession. 

Gilbert Warde was as much a born sportsman as 
he was a fighter, and he had stalked the fallow-deer 
in Stortford woods since he had been old enough to 
draw an arrow's head to his finger. 

Step by step, from tree to tree, with cat-like tread, 





he came nearer, amused by an almost boyish pleasure 
in his own skill. Once the lady moved, but she 
looked in the opposite direction, and then at last, 
when he was within a dozen yards of her, half- 
sheltered by a slender stem, she looked straight across 
toward him, and the light fell upon her face. He 
knew that she saw him, but he could not have moved 
from the spot if it had been to save his life, for the 
lady was Beatrix herself. In spite of a separation 
that had lasted two years, in spite of her final growth 
out of early girlhood, he knew that he was not mis- 
taken, and her dark eyes were looking straight into 
his, telling him that she knew him, too. There was 
no fear in them, and she showed no surprise, but as 
she looked, a very lovely smile came into her sad face. 
He was so glad to see her that he thought little or 
not at all of her looks. But she was not beautiful 
in any common sense, and, saving the expression in 
her face, she could hardly have passed for pretty in 
the presence of Queen Eleanor and of most of her 
three hundred ladies. Her forehead was round and 
full rather than classic, and the thick dark eyebrows 
were somewhat rough and irregular, turning slightly 
upwards as they approached each other, a peculi- 
arity which gave an almost pathetic expression to the 
eyes themselves ; the small and by no means perfectly 
shaped nose was sensitively drawn at the nostrils, 
but had also an odd look of independence and in- 
quiry ; and the wide and shapely lips were more apt 
to smile with a half-humorous sadness than to part 
with laughter. Small and well-modelled ears were 
half covered by dark brown hair that had been almost 



 

black in childhood, and which fell to her shoulders 
in broad waves, in the fashion used by the Queen. 
While Gilbert looked and remained motionless, the 
girl rose lightly to her feet, and he saw that she was 
shorter than he had expected, but slight and delicately 
made. With one hand he could have lifted her from 
the ground, with two he could have held her in the 
air like a child. She was not the Beatrix he remem- 
bered, though he had known her instantly ; she was 
not the solemn, black-eyed maiden of whom he some- 
times dreamed; she was a being full of individual 
life and thought, quick, sensitive, perhaps capri- 
cious, and charming, if she could charm at all, by a 
spell that was quite her own. 

Half-frightened at last by his motionless attitude 
and his silence, she called him by name. 

" Gilbert ! What is the matter ? " 

He shook his broad shoulders as if waking to con- 
sciousness, and the smile in her face was reflected 
in his own. 

The voice, at least, had not changed, and the first 
tones called up the long-cherished record of childish 
years j for scent and sound can span the wastes of 
years and the deserts of separation, when sight is 
dull and even touch is unresponsive. 

Gilbert came forward, holding out both hands; 
and Beatrix took them when he was close to her, 
and held them in hers. The little tears had started 
in her eyes, that were glad as flowers at dew fall, and 
in her very clear, pale cheeks the colour lightened 
like the dawn. 

The man's face was quiet, and his heart was in no 





haste, though he was so glad. He drew her toward 
him, as he had often done, and she seemed light and 
little in his hands. But when he would have kissed 
her cheek as in other times, she turned in his hold 
like a bow that 'is bent but not strung, and straight- 
ened herself again quickly; and something tingled 
in him suddenly, and he tried hard to kiss her; yet 
when he saw that he must hurt her, he let her go, 
and laughed oddly. Her blush deepened to red and 
then faded all at once, and she turned her face 
away. 

"How is it that I have never found you before 
now ? " Gilbert asked softly. " Were you with the 
Queen at V^zelay ? Have you been with her on all 
the march ? " 

"Yes." 

"And did you not know that I was with the 
army?" 

"Yes ; but I could not send you any word. She 
would not let me." The girl looked round quickly 
in sudden apprehension. "If she should find you 
here, it would be ill for you," she added, with a 
gesture of pushing him away. 

But he showed that he would not go away. 

"The Queen has always been kind to me," he 
said. "I am not afraid." 

Beatrix would not turn to him, and was silent. 
He was not timid, but words did not come easily 
just then ; therefore, manlike, he tried to draw her 
to him again. But she put away his hand somewhat 
impatiently and shook her head, whereat he felt the 
tingling warmth in his blood again. Then he remem- 



 

bered how he had felt the same thing on that night 
in V^zelay, when the Queen had pressed his arm 
unexpectedly, and once before, when she had kissed 
him in the tennis-court, and he was angry with him- 
self. 

"Come," she said, "let us sit down and talk. 
There are two years between us." 

She led the way back in the direction whence he 
had come, and when they had reached the bank of 
moss she seated herself and looked out under the 
trees, at the blue water. He stood still a moment as 
though hesitating, and then sat down beside her, 
but not quite close to her, as he would have done in 
earlier years. 

" Yes, " he said thoughtfully, " there are two years 
between us. We must bridge them." 

"And between what we were and what we are 
there is something more than time," she answered, 
still looking far away. 

"Yes." 

He was silent, and he thought of his mother, and 
he knew that Beatrix was thinking of her too, and 
of her own father. It had not occurred to him that 
Beatrix could resent the marriage as bitterly as he, 
nor that she could in any way be as great a loser by 
it as he was. 

"Tell me why you left England," he said at last.
