backed you ? She took you out of the slough, and you give 
yourself fine airs, but they don't go down with me." 

Victor smiled scornfully over his prostrate foe. 

"I have not lorded it over any one," he returned. "It 
has been an even bargain on both sides fair work and fair 
wages. If you do not choose to take them, stay away then. 
Indeed, that was your part of the agreement" 

"I agreed to nothing," sullenly. 

"I believe you did promise to keep the peace, but your 
word is like yourself, not to be trusted. " 



 

Victor ran briefly over the case in his mind. To hand the 
man over to the authorities would be dragging himself into 
notoriety as well, a thing that he did not at all covet. And 
when he caught sight of the bruised face and swollen eye, and 
saw the twinges of pain that passed over the features, his anger 
was satisfied. As for the keener grief, nothing dragged out of 
this brutish nature could compensate for that. So he began 
to gather up the tools and his remaining precious relics. 

Something in Victor Hurst's quiet, superior air maddened 
the low instincts of the prostrate bully more than the bitterest 
speech could have done. The refinement and manly beauty 
roused him, as the contrast always does an ignorant, grovelling 
nature, that is fain to drag every human soul down to its own 
low estate. 

He turned once. Jarvis was making unsteady attempts to 
rise. 

" I give you fair warning ;" and the voice rang out sharply 
clear. "Cross my path again and I will see if there is no law 
to protect a man from a bully and a base, dishonorable coward. 
That is all." 

Jarvis looked after him, and shook his fist in impotent rage. 

" I'll be even with you yet, cursed upstart that you are !" he 
muttered. "Law! There's a way of taking the law in my 
own hands that you mayn't like so well, especially if it 
should chance to spoil your handsome picture.' What a hand 
the man has like a sledge hammer." And Jarvis rubbed him 
self ruefully, groaning at the results of the blow and the fall. 

"Yes, I'll be revenged !" trying to collect his scattered senses. 
"Ill dog him in another way. We'll see who'll win this game, 
my hearty." 

Victor Hurst, walking rapidly away, heard none of the 
threats, though they would not have added to his soreness of 
heart. 

He studied the marble face a long while that night before he 



 

consigned it to the old chest that held the remnant of his 
drawings. The other attempts had long ago perished in the 
flames. 

Was she happy the Sylvia, in that charming nest among the 
mountains ? She had won what women most desired smiling 
with a little pain and scorn. And then if as Trewartha had 
more than half suggested this weak, characterless Eustace 
Gilliat had been her girlish fancy, nothing could have made 
any difference, nothing !



CHAPTER XXIV. 

JANET McRAE was looking out of the window at the old 
oak, struck by lightning many years ago, but not killed. 
Every summer the scattering foliage had grown smaller and 
smaller. This year one twig, high up, had budded, and 
showed a handful of leaves that withered at midsummer. Now 
it was dead. 

She was thinking of herself. It seemed of late that she had 
felt hardly so strong and vigorous. A weak, womanly longing 
to lay down the power in her tired hands and rest a while, 
sometimes seized her. And though she would have confessed 
this to no one, she had not made the headway with Victor 
Hurst that she had counted upon. Something in his silent 
strength baffled her. She could crowd him into no post of 
honor. She could clothe him with no authority. The present 
master of the quarry, filling this one large contract, was all he 
would be. 

Some day they would carry her slowly over to the little plain 
dotted with white gravestones. Who, beside Ruth, would 
reign here ? Ruth, who was slipping out of the stately girl 
hood in which she had enthroned her, coming to have troubled 
lines in her face, and grave, questioning looks in her eyes. 

A light wagon came spinning up the gravelled road, and 
she recognized the figure of Victor Hurst, so she straightened 
herself up stifly, smoothed the mane of white hair, and settled 
her mouth to its grimmest aspect. 

The old servant announced him as if he were quite a 
stranger. 

"Well, lad, "with a brief, cold nod, "what's wrong at the 

I?* 



 

i 

quarry again ? For one may never hope to see you of a morn 
ing unless there is trouble." 

"It is not that, however," bowing, and taking her hand 
with a peculiar deference that made her always think of the 
knightly men in her girlhood's romances. 

She would give him no farther encouragement. If he had 
come upon his own business, he must open the way. She had 
heard not an hour ago that John Hurst was as well as usual, so 
it could not be sickness. 

" I am glad to find you alone," he began, rather hurridly. 
"An incident occurred to me on Monday that has perplexed 
me not a little." 

" You have taken two days to consider it, it seems ;" rather 
tartly, folding and refolding the paper in her hand, a sign 
that she was not in the serenest humor. 

"Yes," in no wise disconcerted by her words or manner. 
' ' And not being able to solve it, I come to you. I think once 
you said there was a doubt whether Sylvia Redmond's father 
was really dead?" 

" And what have you to do with Sylvia Redmond's father ? 
It can be nothing to you whether he is dead or alive." 

"It is something, however," in a grave tone. 

" He is dead, of course. The only sensible thing the man 
ever did was to die when his wife tired of him, which certainly 
was the truth. Such vows are not made for better, for worse, 
it appears." 

Victor looked a little uncertain. Janet McRae was clearly 
not in an amiable mood. 

' ' On Monday I found a poor man not far from my door, 
ill and very much exhausted. Nearly a fortnight before he 
had been at the quarry, asking the most direct route to St. 
Albans ; and recognizing him, I gave him shelter. The next 
day he seemed very weakly, but yesterday he attempted to con 
tinue his journey. He was taken worse only a few rods from 
the house, and last night we thought him dying," 




"What right have you to be receiving tramps in that fashion, 
Victor Hurst?" 

"The divine right of every one to shelter the sick and 
homeless. He is feeble, and wandering in his mind, so I 
hardly dared believe " 

"He doesn't claim to be James Redmond?'' 

Mrs. McRae started as if she had received the shock of a 
galvanic battery. 

"Yes " hesitatingly. "It almost appears as if he must 
have seen Mrs. Redmond lately." 

"The poor, neglected old man ! Perhaps they have thrown 
him off. I think it would be like Margaret Redmond, now 
that she is about to marry her daughter so grandly. A mis 
erable, whining sham and parasite ! I must see this man." 

Her voice was almost shrill in its earnestness. 

"Yes, I came for you. I thought you could tell " 

"I should know James Redmond. A weak, maunder 
ing fellow ; one of your sickly fine gentlemen, whose very 
fingers shrink from contact with anything common or useful. 
\Yhy, Jacob out there, spading, has been of twice the service.
