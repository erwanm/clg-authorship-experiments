only a short time before, learned to pray in this hour of 
need. After prayer each experienced new faith, we all 
felt our courage increased, and found consolation with 
Him who is ever present and ready to befriend the unfor- 
tunate. 

We could not yet relinquish the belief that the boats 
would row quickly to shore, disembark their crews, and 
then turn back to relieve their unfortunate companions 
whom they had left upon the raft. In this hope we saw 
the day depart. After sunset the wind rose, and set the 
waves in motion ; the raft was thrown hither and thither ; 
the soldiers, unaccustomed to the sea, were thrown about 
by every wave, and cried out fearfully, so that the sailors 
fastened various ropes to the raft, to which the soldiers 
clung, and some even lashed themselves down. At mid- 
night the wind grew fiercer, huge waves rolled over us and 
threw the men upon each other. Their shrieks mingled 
with the roar of the sea which now tossed the raft on high 
and then hurled it down to the depths. Some shrieked 
aloud ; some prayed, and others made vows, which they 
were to fulfil after their rescue ; all prepared for death, 
took i';ave of each other, and called upon God for mercy. 

Towards morning the wind subsided somewhat, and the 
sea became more quiet ; but a horrible spectacle was pre- 
sented to our eyes Several unfortunate men had slipped 
into the holes in the raft, and being unable to extricate 
themselves, had miserably perished ; othen? had been lost 
in the sea; in all, twenty people were missing. Although 
each was occup ied with his own saleiy in this druadlul sit- 



 

uation, an instance of filial love drew tears from ail eyea. 
Two young men extricated an old man from under the feel 
of the others and then recognized him for their father. 
At first they thought him dead, and their grief was expres- 
sed in the most heart-rending cries ; but they soon found 
that he yet breathed, and we used every means that were 
in our power, to restore him ; he soon came to himself, to 
the unspeakable joy of his sons, who clung to him and 
covered his neck with kisses. 

While this scene was enacting, two ship boys and a 
baker calmly took leave of their companions, and commit- 
ted suicide by jumping into the sea, boldly as it might 
seem, but in reality it was a cowardly and despairing act, 
or perhaps the result of the insanity that had already 
begun to appear among these wretched men. Some imagined that they saw land ; others, that vessels were coming 
to our relief, and at any of these imaginary discoveries they 
would burst out Into shouts of joy. 

The second day that we passed upon the raft was perfectly clear, and the friendly aspect of the heavens inspired 
us with fresh courage ; most of us were firmly convinced 
that the boats would soon appear. But when the evening 
came and the comfortless night followed, all seemed 
crianged. Not only did all hope vanish, but the spirit of 
rebellion reigned instead ; no one would obey orders and 
cur former prudence was turned to despair. Dark clouds 
agam veiled the heavens and the wind increased so that the 
Bea raged and foamed more fearfully than on the foregoing' 
night. Huge waves rolled over us, throwing us into heaps 
upon one another; fortunately, we had the wind on our 



 

backs so that the force of the sea was somewhat broken by 
the swiftness of our course ; still the waves beat upon us 
from before and behind, and carried off some men spite of 
all their exertions in clinging to the masts that composed 
the raft; all gathered together in the middle of our vessel, 
as that was the point of least danger, and crowded so 
closely that several were stifled. As the raft continually 
turned its broadside to the wind, it stood almost upright, 
so that in order to keep the balance, one was often obliged 
to rush towards the side that was high in the air, spite of 
the foaming waves. 

In this extremity the rage of the soldiers awoke again, 
and as they considered themselves lost, they determined to 
enjoy their last moments and to drink their fill. They 
threw themselves upoil the wine casks, cut great holes in 
them, and filled their tin cups, which had been given to 
them on board of the frigate, as often as they pleased with 
the contents, utterly disregarding all the commands of their 
officers. When the wine had increased their fury and they 
were thoroughly intoxicated, they formed a plan of destroying the raft and .thus releasing themselves and their 
companions from their misery. Scarcely was the plan 
formed when they hastened to carry it into execution. 
One of them, by birth an Asiatic, a gigantic fellow with 
short curling hair and a brqad flat nose, who had already 
made much mischief by his rough and violent temper, step- 
ped to the edge of the raft, with an axe, and began to cut 
the ropes that bound it together. We rushed towards him 
to put a stop to this senseless project; the maniac raised 
his axe against the officer who endeavored to push him 



away, but instantly paid for his madness with his life that 
was terminated by a sword cut. The mutineers now 
seized their swords and knives and rushed upon us. All 
who held their lives dear, seized also their weapons, and 
another soldier who raised his sword against an officer, was 
killed. 

This unexpected resistance somewhat surprised the 
rebels; they grew quieter, but bidding us defiance, re- 
treated slowly io the end of the raft, to carry out their 
intentions there. One of them pretended to stoop and cut 
the rope through with his knife. As soon as we saw this 
we rushed upon him, and threw him overboard, with 
another man who attempted to defend him. Now the 
fight became universal ; part of the mutineers cut and tore 
up the sail, and then threw down the mast, which in 
falling shattered the leg of an officer, and prostrated him 
unconscious upon the raft. The soldiers immediately 
shoved him overboard ; we drew him up and placed him 
upon a cask, but he was pushed off again by the rioters, 
who tried to put out his eyes with a pen-knife. Enraged 
at the sight of such barbarity, we pressed upon the mon- 
sters, sword in hand, broke through their ranks, and killed 
many of them. After this second combat the fury of the 
soldiers suddenly gave place to the most abject cowardice ; 
many of them fell upon their knees and begged for mercy, 
which was granted them. 

It was now midnight, and as we believed that order waa 
finally restored, we returned to our places in the middle 
of the raft, but were upon our guard, and did not lay 
aside our weapons. About an hour afterwards the muti- 



 

neers, who appeared to be entirely beside themselvea, 
arose and rushed upon us again with swords and knives ; 
those of them who had no weapons bit with their teeth, 
so that several of us were quite badly wounded. We 
numbered only fifteen, but we kept so well together, and 
fought with such a scorn of death, that we once again 
gained the victory over our opponents, although they were 
five times as strong in numbers, and threw many of them 
overboard. 

These superhuman exertions deprived many of us, even 
those whom we had always considered as the most self- 
possessed and collected among us, so entirely of all presÂ« 
ence of mind, that they scarcely knew what they were 
doing. Sometimes, for a moment, indeed, the fearful reality 
flashed upon them, like lightning from a thunder-cloud, but 
they were haunted most of the time by the loveliest ima- 
ges. One imagined himself in the midst of the most 
beautiful Italian landscape; another said, very seriously, 
" I know that the boats have forsaken us, but be com- 
forted, I have written to the governor, and in a few hours 
help will arrive." There was need of the greatest self- 
command to keep from being thus bewildered, for who- 
ever gave himself up to such fancies was lost. Thus iti 
was with most of the unhappy soldiers, for they were 
restrained by no consideration. Some of them plunged 
into the sea, crying, " We will soon return and bring you 
help." Others aimed blows at the waves, as if in the 
delirium of fever, not knowing what they were about, and 
others fell upon their companions with their swords, call- 
ing loudly for their favorite dish, a roast fowl The mad- 



 

ness was so universal that inc?t of us did not know in the 
morning whether a fight had really taken place in the 
night, or whether we had only dreamed it. But all were 
overcome with weariness and lamed in every limb. 

III. 

When the day at last broke, we found that, in this fear- 
ful night, sixty men had disappeared, so had the sword, 
the ocean, and a desire for death raged among the ship 
wrecked ; of our party only two were missing, but several 
were wounded, and our clothes were all cut to pieces. 
The deepest dejection was legible upon every counte- 
nance, and many shed bitter tears over their hard fate 
As the sun rose the sea became more calm ; we replaced 
our mast, and did our best to steer for the coast, which we 
several times thought we perceived. 

The mutineers had destroyed, in their fury, two casks 
of wine, and our whole supply of water, so that only a 
small cask of wine yet remained, and the daily measure for 
each man was of course diminished, at which a murmur 
arose among the soldiers. We were all so weary with the
