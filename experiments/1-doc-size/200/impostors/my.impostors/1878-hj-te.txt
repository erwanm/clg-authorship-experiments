finer quality of pluck, than common occasion de- 
manded. Mr. Wentworth would never have risked 
the intimation that Acton was made, in the small- 
est degree, of the stuff of a hero ; but this is small 
blame to him, for Robert would certainly never 
have risked it himself. Acton certainly exercised 
great discretion in all things beginning with his 
estimate of himself. He knew that he was by no 
means so much of a man of the world as he was 
supposed to be in local circles ; but it must be 
added that he knew also that his natural shrewd- 
ness had a reach of which he had never quite given 
local circles the measure. He was addicted to tak- 
ing the humorous view of things, and he had dis- 
covered that, even in the narrowest circles such a 
disposition may find frequent opportunities. Such 
opportunities had formed for some time that is, 
since his return from China, a year and a half be- 
fore the most active element in this gentleman's 
life, which had just now a rather indolent air. 
He was perfectly willing to get married. He was 
very fond of books, and he had a handsome li- 
brary ; that is, his books were much more numer- 
ous than Mr. Wentworth's. He was also very fond 
of pictures ; but it must be confessed, in the fierce 
light of contemporary criticism, that his walls were 
adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces. 
He had got his learning and there was more of 



 

it than commonly appeared at Harvard College ; 
and he took a pleasure in old associations, which 
made it a part of his daily contentment to live so 
near this institution that he often passed it in driv- 
ing to Boston. He was extremely interested in 
the Baroness Miinster. 

She was very frank with him ; or at least she 
intended to be. "I am sure you find it very 
strange that I should have settled down in this 
out-of-the-way part of the world ! " she said to him 
three or four weeks after she had installed herself. 
" I am certain you are wondering about my mo- 
tives. They are very pure." The Baroness by 
this time was an old inhabitant; the best society 
in Boston had called upon her, and Clifford Went- 
worth had taken her several times to drive in his 
buggy. 

Robert Acton was seated near her, playing with 
a fan ; there were always several fans lying about 
her drawing-room, with long ribbons of different 
colors attached to them, and Acton was always 
playing with one, "No, I don't find it at all 
strange," he said slowly, smiling. " That a clever 
woman should turn up in Boston, or its suburbs 
that does not require so much explanation. 
Boston is a very nice place.'* 

" If you wish to make me contradict you," said 
the Baroness, " vous vous y prenez mal. In certain 
moods there is nothing I am not capable of 
agreeing to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in 
the suburbs of Paradise." 

" Just now I am not at all in the suburbs ; I 
am in the place itself," rejoined Acton, who was 
lounging a little in his chair. He was, however, 
not always lounging; and when he was he was 
not quite so relaxed as he pretended. To a cer- 
tain extent, he sought refuge from shyness in this 
appearance of relaxation ; and like many persons 
in the same circumstances he somewhat exagger- 
ated the appearance. Beyond this, the air of being 
much at his ease was a cover for vigilant observa- 
tion. He was more than interested in this clever 
woman, who, whatever he might say, was clever 
not at all after the Boston fashion ; she plunged 
him into a kind of excitement, held him in vague 
suspense. He was obliged to admit to himself 
that he had never yet seen a woman just like this 
not even in China. He was ashamed, for in- 
scrutable reasons, of the vivacity of his emotion, 
and he carried it off, superficially, by taking, still 
superficially, the humorous view of Madame Miin- 
ster. It was not at all true that he thought it 
very natural of her to have made this pious pilgrim- 
age. It might have been said of him in advance 
that he was too good a Bostonian to regard in the 
light of an eccentricity the desire of even the re- 



 

motest alien to visit the New England metropolis. 
This was an impulse for which, surely, no apology 
was needed ; and Madame Miinster was the for- 
tunate possessor of several New England cousins. 
In fact, however, Madame Miinster struck him as 
out of keeping with her little circle ; she was at 
the best a very agreeable, a gracefully mystifying 
anomaly. He knew very well that it would not 
do to address these reflections too crudely to Mr. 
Wentworth ; he would never have remarked to 
the old gentleman that he wondered what the 
Baroness was up to. And indeed he had no great 
desire to share his vague mistrust with any one. 
There was a personal pleasure in it ; the greatest 
pleasure he had known at least since he had come 
from China. He would keep the Baroness, for 
better or worse, to himself ; he had a feeling that 
he deserved to enjoy a monoply of her, for he was 
certainly the person who had most adequately 
gauged her capacity for social intercourse. Before 
long it became apparent to him that the Baroness 
was disposed to lay no tax upon such a monopoly. 
One day (he was sitting there again and play- 
ing with a fan) she asked him to apologize, should 
the occasion present itself, to certain people in 
Boston for her not having returned their calls. 
" There are half a dozen places," she said ; " a 
formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has writ- 



   

ten it out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. 
There is no ambiguity on the subject; I know 
perfectly where I must go. Mr. Wentworth in- 
forms me that the carriage is always at my dis- 
posal, and Charlotte offers to go with me, in a 
pair of tight gloves and a very stiff petticoat. 
And yet for three days I have been putting it off. 
They must think me horribly vicious." 

" You ask me to apologize," said Acton, " but 
you don't tell me what excuse I can offer." 

" That is more," the Baroness declared, " than 
I am held to. It would be like my asking you to 
buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I 
have no reason except that somehow it 's too 
violent an effort. It is not inspiring. Would n't 
that serve as an excuse, in Boston ? I am told 
they are very sincere ; they don't tell fibs. And 
then Felix ought to go with me, and he is never 
in readiness. I don't see him. He is always 
roaming about the fields and sketching old barns, 
or taking ten-mile walks, or painting some one's 
portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with 
Gertrude Wentworth." 

" I should think it would amuse you to go and 
see a few people," said Acton. " You are having 
a very quiet time of it here. It 's a dull life for 
you." 

"Ah, the quiet, the quiet!" the Baroness 



 

exclaimed. " That 's what I like. It 's rest. 
That 's what I came here for. Amusement ? I 
have had amusement. And as for seeing people 
I have already seen a great many in my life. 
If it did n't sound ungracious I should say that 
I wish very humbly your people here would leave 
me alone ! " 

Acton looked at her a moment, and she looked 
at him. She was a woman who took being looked 
at remarkably well. " So you have come here 
for rest ? " he asked. 

"So I may say. I came for many of those 
reasons that are no reasons don't you know ? 
and yet that are really the best : to come away, 
to change, to break with everything. When once 
one comes away one must arrive somewhere, and 
I asked myself why I should n't arrive here." 

" You certainly had time on the way ! " said 
Acton, laughing. 

Madame Miinster looked at him again ; and 
then, smiling : " And I have certainly had time, 
since I got here, to ask myself why I came. How- 
ever, I never ask myself idle questions. Here I 
ain, and it seems to me you ought only to thank 
me." 

" When you go away you will see the difficul- 
ties I shall put in your path."
