ing eyes, oh bald-headed, grim-visaged senior- 
partner! 

— It is my business to show samples of paper. 
I shall learn all about them in a few days, and 
then I shall go at the Greek. 

July 28th. 

Whenever I feel weary I run ofif into a corner 
and whisper into my ear, " It is done! Be not 
afraid!" Instantly my heart goes up like swift 
music. 

July 31st. 

Twelve days since I left The Captive; they 
said it would take three weeks. 

Something strange flashed over me to-day, 
something that sent a shudder through me; I 






have done a strange thing to myself this summer, 
not in metaphor, but in fact. I have seen a ghost; 
I have drunk a potion; I have gazed upon a 
nymph; I have made myself mad! 

I am no longer a man among men — I am 
" the reed that grows never more again " ! 

— I try to lose myself in a book, but the book 
does not hold me. Nothing satisfies me as it 
used to, — I am restless, hungry, ill at ease. Why 
should I read this man's weak efiforts — what 
profits me that man's half-truths? 

— And all the time I know too well what I 
want — I want to fight! 

I want to get back into the woods again! I 
want that vision again! That work again! I 
want myself! 

— And here I am, a bird in a cage, beating the 
bars. What folly to say that I can be strong and 
endure this thing! That I can endure anything, 
dare anything. Yes, so I can — if I can strive! 
Put me out there alone, and set me a task, and 
I will do it though it kill me. But how can I 
conquer when I can not strive? 


Here I am, tied! I am tied — not hand and 
foot — but tied in soul. Tied in time! Tied in 
attention! How can I be anything but beaten 
and wretched? How can I expect anything but 
defeat and ruin? A song comes to me, it calls 
me — and I can not go! I must stare at it and 
watch it leave me! — How can that not drive me 
wild? 

The great wings of my soul begin to beat — I 
go up, I am wild for the air, — and then suddenly 
I am struck back by the hideous impertinences 
of the wholesale-paper business! How can I en- 
dure such things as that — how can I conquer? 
Why, it is like the clashing in my ears of twenty 
trumpets out of tune! 

Do not keep me here long! Do not keep 
me here long! 

— It is something that I find very strange and 
curious to watch — how spontaneously, and 
instinctively, all young men dislike me. Have I 
a brand upon my forehead? 

It is not my habit to stand upon the pedestal 
of my inspiration, and gaze down upon those that 


I meet. Sympathy is my life — I can sympa- 
thize even with men who aspire to rise in busi- 
ness. But I have to Hve many lives, and new 
lives; and I can brook no delay. 

I will make no compromises; I have sworn a 
vow against idle words — they may dislike me as 
they will. I give my work, for which I am paid; 
I can not give my soul. 

August 2d. 
Oh what a horrible thing is "business"! 
Here, where I am, — this is the world. An indus- 
trial era ! 

This is a wholesale-paper house, and the 
three partners who run it call themselves, with 
unconscious irony, "wholesale-paper men"! 
They live their lives in wholesale-paper, — they 
talk it — they dream it — they plan it — they have 
no hope in the world except to find people to buy 
wholesale-paper! And the manager — keen and 
hungry — he is planning to be a wholesale-paper 
man himself. And here are twenty-five men and 
youths apparently having but one virtue in the 
world, the possibility of consecrating their souls 
to wholesale-paper! 

What they make is useful, it may even be 


sublime — in which way the business is unique. 
But none of these men ever thinks of that — they 
would be just as absorbed in the business if it 
were wholesale bonnets. None of them has the 
least care in the world about books. And these 
men who come here to buy the paper — are they 
any better? Or is their interest in the paper the 
profits it may bring to them? 

— Dear God! — That brought me back to The 
Captive. 

— I have been sick to-day, and sickness clips 
your wings. It is an error of mine — I pay for 
my food with my soul, and so I try to eat httle, 
and thereby make myself ill. 

August 3d. 

I got my first twelve dollars to-day! 

August 5th. 
To-day I made a resolution, that I must stop 
this chafing, this panting, this beating my wings 
to pieces. A man's inspiration must be under his 
control, to stop it, as well as to start it. I can not 
write or dream poetry while I am in this slavery, 
and somehow I have to realize it. When I go 






home I will get to some work, and not wander 
around hungering. 

After my glimpse of the forest it is frightful 
to be penned in this steaming city. To have to 
work in an office all day — sometimes it makes 
me reel. And then at night too, when I try to 
read, the room gets sufifocating. 

Then I go out among the tenement-house 
crowds, carrying my little note-book. I stop at 
a lamp-post and look at a couple of words and 
then walk on and learn them ! So I go for hours. 

— Hurry up, publishers! — I wrote to them 
to-night. 

August 7th. 
" In answer to your letter of the 5th instant, 
we beg to inform you that your manuscript is 
now in the hands of our readers, and that you 
may expect a report upon it in a week." 

I am reading Euripides. 

August 8th. 

Oh how will I find words for my delight when 

I have got a little money and can escape from 

dirt and horror. To-night two vile men have 

been quarreling in the room underneath, and I 


have been drinking in all their brutal ugliness. 
Bah!— 

To live in a place where there are not hor- 
rible women in wrappers, reeling, foul-smelling 
men, snuffling children with beer-cans! 

This is more of my " economy "! 

To-night I sat upon the edge of the bed and 
whispered, " To be free! I shall be free! " — until 
I was trembling in every nerve.
