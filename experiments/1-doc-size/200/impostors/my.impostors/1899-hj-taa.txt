go to the Mangers." 

" Happy thought ! And shall I write ?" 

His mother raised a little more a window-blind. "No 
—I will." 

"Delicious mummy !" And Harold blew her a kiss. 

"Yes, rather" — she corrected herself. "Do write — 





  

from Brander. It's the sort of thing for the Mangers. Or 
even wire' 

' Both ?" the young man laughed. "Oh you duck V 
he cried. "And from where will you let them have 
it?" 

"From Pewhur ' she replied without wincing. "Til 
write on Sunday." 

"Good. How d'ye do. Duchess ?" — and Harold, hefore 
he disappeared, greeted with a rapid concentration of all 
the shades of familiarity a large, high lady, the visitor he 
had announced, who rose in the doorway with the manner 
of a person used to arriving on thresholds very much as 
people arrive at stations — with the expectation of being 
" met." 



" Good-by. He's off," Mrs. Brookenham, who had re- 
mained quite on her own side of the room, explained to 
her friend. 

" Where's he off to ?" this friend inquired with a 
casual advance and a look not so much at her hostess as 
at the cushions just rearranged. 

" Oh, to some places. To Brander to-day." 

" How he does run about !" And the Duchess, still 
with a glance hither and yon, sank upon the sofa to 
which she had made her way unaided. Mrs. Brooken- 
ham knew perfectly the meaning of this glance : she had 
but three or four comparatively good pieces, whereas the 
Duchess, rich with the spoils of Italy, had but three or 
four comparatively bad. This was the relation, as be- 
tween intimate friends, that the Duchess visibly pre- 
ferred, and it was quite groundless, in Buckingham 
Crescent, ever to enter the drawing-room with an ex- 
pression suspicious of disloyalty. The Duchess was a 
woman who so cultivated her passions that she would 





 

have regarded it as disloyal to introduce there a now 
piece of furniture in an underhand way — that is without 
a full appeal to herself, the highest authority, and the 
consequent bestowal of opportunity to nip the mistake 
in the bud. Mrs. Brookenham had repeatedly asked 
herself where in the world she might have found the 
money to be disloyal. The Duchess's standard was of a 
height — ! It matched, for that matter, her other ele- 
ments, which were as conspicuous as usual as she sat 
there suggestive of early tea. She always suggested tea 
before the hour, and her friend always, but with so dif- 
ferent a wistfulness, rang for it. "Who's to be at Bran- 
der ?" she asked. 

" I haven't the least idea — he didn't tell me. But 
they've always a lot of people." 

 '' Oh, I know — extraordinary mixtures. Has he been 
there before ?" 

Mrs. Brookenham thought.  ''Oh yes — if I remember 
— more than once. In fact her note — which he showed 
me, but which only mentioned ' some friends ' — was a 
sort of appeal on the ground of something or other that 
had happened the last time." 

The Duchess was silent a moment.  ''She writes the 
most extraordinary notes." 

"Well, this was nice, I thought," Mrs. Brookenham 
said — "from a woman of her age and her immense posi- 
tion to so young a man." 

Again the Duchess reflected. " My dear, she's not an 
American and she's not on the stage. Aren't those what 
you call positions in this country ? And she's also not a 
hundred." 

"Yes, but Harold's a mere baby." 

" Then he doesn't seem to want for nurses !" the Duch- 
ess replied. She smiled at her friend. " Your children 
are like their mother — they're eternally young." 

"Well, I'm not a hundred!" moaned Mrs. Brookcn- 





  

ham as if she wished with dim perversity that she were. 
 '' Every one, at any rate, is awfully kind to Harold." 
She waited a moment, to give her visitor the chance to 
pronounce it eminently natural, but no pronouncement 
came — nothing but the footman who had answered her 
ring and of whom she ordered tea. " And where did you 
say yoiCre going ?" she inquired after this. 

" For Easter ?" The Duchess achieved a direct en- 
counter with her charming eyes — which was not, in gen- 
eral, an easy feat. " I didn't say I was going anywhere. 
I haven't, of a sudden, changed my habits. You know 
whether I leave my child — except in the sense of having 
left her an hour ago at Mr. Garlick's class in Modern 
Light Literature. I confess I'm a little nervous about 
the subjects and am going for her at five." 

'  And then where do you take her ?" 

 '  ' Home to her tea — where should you think ?" 

Mrs. Brookenham declined, in connection with the mat- 
ter, any responsibility of thought ; she did indeed much 
better by saying after a moment : "You are devoted !" 

" Miss Merriman has her afternoon — I can't imagine 
what they do with their afternoons," the Duchess went 
on. " But she's to be back in the school-room at seven." 

"And you have Aggie till then ?" 

" Till then," said the Duchess cheerfully. "You're off, 
for Easter, to — where is it ?" she continued. 

Mrs. Brookenham had received with no flush of be- 
trayal the various discriminations thus conveyed by her 
visitor, and her only revenge, for the moment, was to 
look as sweetly resigned as if she really saw what was in 
them. Where were they going for Easter ? She had to 
think an instant, but she brought it out. "Oh, to Pew- 
bury — we've been engaged so long that I had forgotten. 
We go once a year — one does it for Edward." 

"Ah, you spoil him !" smiled the Duchess. "Who's 
to be there ?" 


"Oh, the usual thing, I suppose. A lot of my lord's 
tiresome supporters.' 

" To pay his debt ? Then why are you poor things 
asked ?" 

Mrs. Brookenham looked, on this, quite adorably — 
that is most wonderingly — grave. "How do I know, 
my dear Jane, why in the world we're ever asked any- 
where ? Fancy people wanting Edward !" she quavered 
with stupefaction. "Yet we can never get off Pew- 
bury." 

"You're better for getting on, cava mia, than for get- 
ting off !" the Duchess blandly returned. She was a 
person of no small presence, filling her place, however, 
without ponderosity, with a massiveness indeed rather 
artfully kept in bounds. Her head, her chin, her shoul- 
ders were well aloft, but she had not abandoned the cul- 
tivation of a "figure," or any of the distinctively finer 
reasons for passing as a handsome woman. She was se- 
cretly at war, moreover, in this endeavor, with a lurking 
no less than with a public foe, and thoroughly aware that 
if she didn't look well she might at times only, and quite 
dreadfully, look good. There were definite ways of es- 
cape, none of which she neglected and from the total of 
which, as she flattered herself, the air of distinction al- 
most mathematically resulted. This air corresponded 
superficially with her acquired Calabrian sonorities, from 
her voluminous title down, but the colorless hair, the 
passionless forehead, the mild cheek and long lip of the 
British matron, the type that had set its trap for her 
earlier than any other, were elements difficult to deal 
with, and were all, at moments, that a sharp observer 
saw. The battle-ground then was the haunting danger
