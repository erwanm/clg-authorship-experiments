drawn from her the little cold question: '' Presents'? 
You don't mean money?" 

He clearly felt the importance of expressing at least 
by his silence and his eye-glass what he meant. " Her 
extravagance is beyond everything, and though there 
:ire bills enough, God knows, that do come in to me, I 
don't see how she pulls through unless there are others 
that go elsewhere." 

Mrs. Brookenham had given him his tea — her own 
she had placed on a small table near her, and she could 
now respond freely to the impulse felt, on this, of set- 
tling herself to something of real interest. Except to 
Harold she was incapable of reproach, though there were 
shades, of course, in her resignation, and her daughter's 
report of her to Mr. Longdon as conscious of an ab- 
sence of prejudice would have been justified, for a spec- 
tator, by the particular feeling that Mr. Cashmere's 
speech caused her to disclose. What did this feeling 
wonderfully appear unless strangely irrelevant ? "  I've 
no patience when I hear you talk as if you weren't hor- 
ribly rich." 

He looked at her an instant as if with the fancy that 
she might have derived that impression from Harold. 
" What has that to do with it ? Does a rich man enjoy 
any more than a poor his wife's making a fool of him ?" 

Her eyes opened wider : it was one of her very few 
ways of betraying amusement. There was little indeed 
to be amused at here except his choice of the particular 
invidious name. ''' You know I don't believe a word you 
say." 

Mr. Oashmore drank his tea, then rose to carry the cup 
somewhere and put it down, declining, with a motion, 
any assistance. When he was on the sofa again he re- 
sumed their intimate talk. " I like tremendously to be 





  

with you, but yon mustn't think Tve come here to let 
yoa say to me such dreadful things as that." He was an 
odd compound, Mr. Oashmore, and the air of personal 
good health, the untarnished bloom whicli sometimes 
lent a monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely 
mentionable, was on occasion balanced or matched by his 
playful application of extravagant terms to matters of 
much less moment. ' You know what I come to you 
for, Mrs. Brook : I won't come any more if you're going 
to be horrid and impossible." 

 ' You come to me, I suppose, because — for my deep 
misfortune, I assure you — I've a kind of vision of things, 
of the wretched miseries in which you all knot your- 
selves up, which you yourselves are as little blessed with 
as if, tumbling about together in your heap, you were a 
litter of blind kittens." 

" Awfully good, that — you do lift the burden of my 
trouble !" He had laughed out, in the manner of the 
man who made notes, for platform use, of things that 
might serve ; but the next moment he was grave again, 
as if his observation had reminded him of Harold's praise 
of his wit. It was in this sj)irit that he abruptly brought 
out : '  Where, by-the-way, is your daughter ?" 

'' I haven't the least idea. I do all I can to enter into 
her life, but you can't get into a railway train while it's 
on the rush." 

Mr. Oashmore swung back to hilarity. '' You give me 
lots of things. Do you mean she's so  ' fast ' ?" He could 
keep the ball going. 

Mrs. Brookenham hesitated. '' No ; she's a tremen- 
dous dear, and we're great friends. But she has her free 
young life, which, by that law of our time that I'm sure 
I only want, like all other laws, once I know what they 
are, to accept — she has her precious freshness of feeling 
which I say to myself that, so far as control is concerned, 
I ought to respect. I try to get her to sit with me, and 





 

she does so often, because she's kind. But before I know 
it she leaves me again : she feels that her presence makes 
a difference in one's liberty of talk." 

Mr. Cashmore was struck by this picture. "That's 
awfully charming of her." 

"Isn't it too dear?" The thought of it, for Mrs. 
Brook, seemed fairly to open out vistas. " The modern 
daughter !" 

" But not the ancient mother !" Mr. Cashmore smiled. 

She shook her head with a world of accepted woe. 
" '-Give me back, give me back one hour of my youth' ? 
Oh, I haven't a single thrill left to answer a compliment. 
I sit here now face to face with things as they are. They 
come in their turn, I assure you — and they find me," 
Mrs. Brook sighed, "ready. Nanda has stepped on the 
stage, and I give her up the house. Besides," she went 
on musingly, " it's awfully interesting. It is the modern 
daughter — we're really ' doing ' her, the child and I ; and 
as the modern has always been my own note — I've gone 
in, I mean, frankly for my very own Time— who is one, 
after all, that one should pretend to decline to go where 
it may lead ?" Mr. Cashmore was unprepared with an 
answer to this question, and his hostess continued in a 
different tone : "It's sweet her sparing one I" 

This, for the visitor, was firmer ground. " Do you 
mean about talking before her ?" 

Mrs. Brook's assent was positively tender. " She won't 
have a difference in my freedom. It's as if the dear thing 
hieiu, don't you see ? what we must keep back. She wants 
us not to have to think. It's quite maternal !" she mused 
again. Then, as if with the pleasure of presenting it to 
him afresh : " That's the modern daughter !" 

" Well," said Mr. Cashmore, "I can't help wishing she 
were a trifle less considerate. In that case I might find 
her with you, and I may tell you frankly that I get more 
from her than I do from you. She has the great merit 





  

for me, in the first place, of not being such an admirer of 
my wife." 

Mrs. Brookenham took this up with interest. '' No — 
you're right ; she doesn't, as I do, see Lady Fanny, and 
that's a kind of mercy." 

 '  There you are, then, you inconsistent creature," he 
cried with a laugh ; ''after all you do believe me. You 
recognize how benighted it would be for your daughter 
not to feel that Fanny's bad." 

"You're too tiresome, my dear man," Mrs. Brook re- 
turned, " with your ridiculous simplifications. Fanny's 
not ' bad'; she's magnificently good — in the sense of being 
generous and simple and true, too adorably unaffected 
and without the least mesquinerie. She's a great calm 
silver statue." 

Mr.Cashmore showed, on this, something of the strength 
that comes from the practice of public debate. " Then 
why are you glad that your daughter doesn't like her ?" 

Mrs. Brook smiled as with the sadness of having too 
much to triumph. ''Because I'm not, like Fanny, with- 
out mesquinerie, I'm not generous and simple. I'm ex- 
aggeratedly anxious about Nanda. I care, in spite of 
myself, for what people may say. Your wife doesn't — 
she towers above them. I can be a shade less brave 
through the chance of my girl's not happening to feel her 
as the rest of us do." 

Mr. Cashmore too heavily followed. "To 'feel' her?" 

Mrs. Brook floated over. " There would be, in that 
case perhaps, something to hint to her not to shriek on 
the house-tops. "When you say," she continued, "that 
one admits, as regards Fanny, anything wrong, you per- 
vert dreadfully what one does freely grant — that she's a 
great glorious pagan. It's a real relief to know such a 
type — it's like a flash of insight into history. None the 
less, if you ask me why then it isn't all right for young 
things to 'shriek' as I say, I have my answer perfectly 





 

ready.'" After which, as her visitor seemed not only too 
reduced to doubt it, but too baffled to distinguish audi- 
bly, for his credit, between resignation and admiration, 
she produced :  '' Because she's purely instinctive. Her 
instincts are splendid — but it's terrific."
