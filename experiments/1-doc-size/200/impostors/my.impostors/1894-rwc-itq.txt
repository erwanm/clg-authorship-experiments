He came from where he had been standing 
by the table and seated himself once more 
among the furs at her feet. 

"Do I, Helene?" 

"Yes ; but you sing it divinely." 

Gethryn began to hum the air ot the dream 
song, smiling, "Yes tis a dream a dream of 
love," he repeated, but stopped. 

Yvonne's temples and throat were crimson. 

"Please open the window," she cried, "it's so 
warm here." 

"Helene, I think you are blushing," said he, 
mischievously. 

She turned her head away from him. He rose 
and opened the window leaning out a moment; 
his heart was beating violently. Presently he 
returned. 



 

"It's one o clock." 
No answer. 

"Helene, it's one o clock in the morning." 
"Are you tired?" she murmured. 
"No." 

"Nor I don't go." 
"But it's one o clock." 
"Don't go yet." 

He sank down irresolutely on the rug again. 
"I ought to go," he murmured. 
"Are we to remain friends?" 
"That is for Helene to say." 
"And Helene will leave it to Homer !" 
"To whom?" said Gethryn. 
"Monsieur Homer," said the girl, faintly. 
"But that was a tragedy." 
"But they were friends." 
"In a way. Yes, in away." 
Gethryn tried to return to alight tone. "They 
fell in love, I believe." No answer. "Very well," 
said Gethryn, still trying to joke, "I will carry 
you oft in a boat, then." 
"To Troy when?" 

"No, to Meudon, when you are well. Do you 
like the country?" 





"I love it," she said. 

"Well, I'll take my easel and my paints along 
too." 

She looked at him seriously. "You are an 
artist I heard that from the concierge." 

"Yes," said Gethryn, "I think I may claim 
the title to-night." 

And then he told her about the Salon. She 
listened, and brightened with sympathy. Then 
she grew silent. 

"Do yon paint landscapes?" 

"Figures," said the young man, shortly. 

"From models?" 

"Of course," he answered, still more drily. 

"Draped," she persisted. 

"No." 

"I hate models!" she cried out, almost fiercely. 

"They are not a pleasing set, as a rule," he 
admitted. "But I know some decent ones." 

She shivered and shook her curly head. "Some 
are very pretty, I suppose." 

"Some." 

"Do you know Sarah Brown?" 

"Yes, I know Sarah." 

"Hen go wild about her." 



 

"I never did." 

Yvonne was out of humor. "Oh," she cried, 
petulantly, "you are very cold you Americans, like ice." 

"Because we don't run after Sarah?" 

"Because you are a nation of business, and " 

"And brains," said Gethryn, drily. 

There was an uncomfortable pause. Gethryn 
looked at the girl. She lay with her face turned 
from him. 

"Helene!" No answer. "Yvonne, Made 
moiselle!" No answer. "It's two o clock." 

A slight impatient movement of the head. 

"Good-night." Gethryn rose. "Good-night," 
he repeated. He waited for a moment. 
"Good-night, Yvonne," he said, for the third 
time. 

She turned slowly toward him, and as he 
looked down at her, he felt a tenderness as for 
a sick child. 

"Good-night," he said, once more, and, bend 
ing over her, gently laid the little gold clasp in 
her open hand. She looked at it in surprise; 
then suddenly she leaned swiftly toward him, 
rested a brief second against him, and then sank 





back again. The golden fleur-de-lis glittered 
over his heart. 

"You will wear it?" she whispered. 

"Yes." 

"Then good-night." 

Half unconsciously he stooped and kissed her 
forehead; then went his way. And all that 
night one slept until the morning broke, and 
one saw morning break, then fell asleep. 



CHAPTER VI. 

It was the first day of June. In the Luxem 
bourg Gardens a soft breeze stirred the tender 
chestnut leaves, and blew sparkling ripples across 
the water in the Fountain of Marie de Medicis. 

The modest little hot-house flowers had quite 
recovered from the shock of recent transplant 
ing, and were ambitiously pushing out long 
spikes and clusters of crimson, purple and gold, 
filling the air with spicy perfuma, and drawing 
an occasional battered butterfly, gaunt and seedy, 
from his long winter's sleep, but still remembering the flowery days of last season's brilliant 
debut. 

Through the fresh young leaves the sunshine 
fell, dappling the glades and thickets, bathing 
the gray walls of the Palais du Senat, and almost warming into life the queer old statues of 
long departed royalty, which, for so many 
years, have looked down from the great terrace 

to the Palace of the King. 







Through every gate the people drifted into 
the gardens, and the winding paths were dotted 
and crowded with brightly- colored, slowly-moving groups. 

Here a half dozen meager, black-robed priests
