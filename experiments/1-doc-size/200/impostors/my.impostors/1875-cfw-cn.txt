"An evil beast is in this house. Let him de- 
part." 

"Do you mean me?" said Eaymond, who had 
made himself comfortable in a rocking-chair. 

" Nay ; I refer to the four-legged beast," continued 
the voice. " Come forth, Apollyon ! " 

Poor Captain Kidd seemed to feel that he was the 
person in question, for he hastened under the table 
with drooping tail and mortified aspect. 

" Roxana, send forth the beast," said the voice. 

The woman put down her dishes and went toward 
the table ; but I interposed. 

" If he must go, I will take him," I said, rising. 

" Yes ; he must go," replied Eoxana, holding open 
the door. So I ordered out the unwilling Captain, 
and led him into the passageway. 

" Out of the house, out of the house/' said "Wait- 
ing Samuel. " His feet may not rest upon this 
sacred ground. I must take him hence in the boat." 

" But where ? " 



 

"Across the channel there is an islet large enough 
for him ; he shall have food and shelter, but here he 
cannot abide," said the man, leading the way down 
to the boat. 

The Captain was therefore ferried across, a tent 
was made for him out of some old mats, food was 
provided, and, lest he should swim back, he was 
tethered by a long rope, which allowed him to prowl 
around his domain and take his choice of three runs 
for drinking-water. With all these advantages, the 
ungrateful animal persisted in howling dismally as 
we rowed away. It was company he wanted, and 
not a " dear little isle of his own " ; but then, he 
was not by nature poetical. 

" You do not like dogs ? " I said, as we reached 
our strand again. 

"St. Paul wrote, 'Beware of dogs/" replied Sam- 
uel. 

" But did he mean " 

" I argue not with unbelievers ; his meaning is 
clear to me, let that suffice," said my strange host, 
turning away and leaving me to find my way back 
alone. A delicious repast was awaiting me. Years 
have gone by, the world and all its delicacies have 
been unrolled before me, but the memory of the 
meals I ate in that little kitchen in the Flats haunts 
me still. That night it was only fish, potatoes, bis- 
cuits, butter, stewed fruit, and coffee; but the fish 
u* u 



 

was fresh, and done to the turn of a perfect broil, 
not burn; the potatoes were fried to a rare crisp, 
yet tender perfection, not chippy brittleness ; the bis- 
cuits were light, flaked creamily, and brown on the 
bottom ; the butter freshly churned, without salt ; 
the fruit, great pears, with their cores extracted, 
standing whole on their dish, ready to melt, but not 
melted; and the coffee clear and strong, with yellow 
cream and the old-fashioned, unadulterated loaf-sugar. 
We ate. That does not express it ; we devoured. 
Roxana waited on us, and warmed up into something 
like excitement under our praises. 

" I do like good cooking," she confessed. " It 's 
about all I have left of my old life. I go over to 
the mainland for supplies, and in the winter I try all 
kinds of new things to pass away the time. But Sam- 
uel is a poor eater, he is; and so there isn't much 
comfort in it. I'm mighty glad you've come, and 
I hope you'll stay as long as you find it pleasant." 
This we promised to do, as we finished the pota- 
toes and attacked the great jellied pears. "There's 
one thing, though," continued Eoxana; "you'll have 
to come to our service on the roof at sunrise." 

"What service?" I asked. 

" The invocation. Dawn is a holy time, Samuel says, 
and we always wait for it ; ' before the morning watch,' 
you know, it says so in the Bible. Why, my name 
' the dawn,' Samuel says ; that 's the reason he 



 

gave it to me. My real name, down in Maine, was 
Maria, Maria Ann." 

" But I may not wake in time," I said. 

" Samuel will call you." 

" And if, in spite of that, I should sleep over ? " 

" You would not do that ; it would vex him," replied 
Roxana, calmly. 

"Do you believe in these visions, madam?" asked 
Raymond, as we left the table, and seated ourselves in 
front of the dying fire. 

"Yes," said Roxana; emphasis was unnecessary, 
of course she believed. 

" How often do they come ? " 

" Almost every day there is a spiritual presence, but 
it does not always speak. They come and hold long 
conversations in the winter, when there is nothing else 
to do ; that, I think, is very kind of them, for in the 
summer Samuel can fish, and his time is more occupied. 
There were fishermen in the Bible, you know ; it is a 
holy calling." 

" Does Samuel ever go over to the mainland ? " 

" No, he never leaves the Flats. I do all the busi- 
ness; take over the fish, and buy the supplies. I 
bought all our cattle," said Roxana, with pride. " I 
poled them away over here on a raft, one by one, when 
they were little things." 

" Where do you pasture them ? " 

" Here, on the island ; there are only a few acres, to 



 

be sure ; but I can cut boat-loads of the best feed with- 
in a stone's throw. If we only had a little more solid 
ground ! But this island is almost the only solid piece 
in the Flats." 

" Your butter is certainly delicious." 

" Yes, I do my best. It is sold to the steamers and 
vessels as fast as I make it." 

" You keep yourself busy, I see." 

" O, I like to work ; I couldn't get on without it." 

" And Samuel ? " 

" He is not like me," replied Eoxana. " He has great 
gifts, Samuel has. I often think how strange it is that 
I should be the wife of such a holy man ! He is very- 
kind to me, too ; he tells me about the visions, and all 
the other things." 

" What things ? " said Eaymond. 

" The spirits, and the sacred influence of the sun ; 
the fiery triangle, and the thousand years of joy. The 
great day is coming, you know ; Samuel is waiting for 
it." 

" Nine of the night. Take thou thy rest. I will lay 
me down in peace, and sleep, for it is thou, Lord, only, 
that makest me dwell in safety," chanted a voice in the 
hall ; the tone was deep and not without melody, and 
the words singularly impressive in that still, remote 
place. 

" Go," said Eoxana, instantly pushing aside her half- 
washed dishes. " Samuel will take you to your room." 



 

" Do you leave your work unfinished ? " I said, with 
some curiosity, noticing that she had folded her hands 
without even hanging up her towels.
