dawned upon her slowly, at no precise epoch, but made 
itself manifest at length. The tender conscience had 
striven up to every point of duty. There has been no 
going after forbidden gods. And, though there was sor- 
sow and penitence, there was no shame. 

"It is because I know what it will be to him," she 
cried, with remorseful tenderness. " He loves me so ! He 
would take the half-love and be content, trusting for it to 
grow and blossom. How can I make myself fit and 
worthy ? What must I do ? " 

She asked it in all earnestness. He knew how reso- 
lutely she would go at her task if he decided it was her 
duty, but she could do no more than she had already done 
out of her pure heart. It was a sad mistake for both. 
He seemed almost unable to counsel 

" There is only one thing," he said presently ; " waiting. 
Some light may come. But it would be a sin to marry 
this way, unless it were an expiation. If you had tried 
for this love, if you had detached it from some other joy 
It might have had, you would owe it a solemn duty. Such 
debts have been paid, and the soul has come to a higher 
living through sacrifice. But I cannot see that this would 
be }T>ur duty." 

She was weeping softly now. What havoc these young 
people had made with their lives ! 

But he comforted her and bade her be patient with what 
was to come. The way would be made plain. 

Charlie Darrell waited as well. If this would bring her 





nearer ; if the outgrowth of it all could be such love as a 
man had a right to expect ! But her answer, touching 
and tender as it was, gave him no thread for a nearer 
hope. 

What if it was a greater thing than a love to hold for 
his own comforting and delight, a love to give away some 
time? 

He said at first, as youth is prone to cry out in the dark- 
ness and sense of bitter loss, that he could not, that God 
would not have placed this lovely blossom in his garden 
only to be transplanted. Some other thing, some other 
cross to bear ; another duty to test his ready obedience, 
not the sacrifice of the first dear object. 

But she gave no sign of drawing nearer. Tender, sym- 
pathetic, interested, saying so many comforting things to 
make up for the loss of the one thing she could not say in 
highest truth to herself. He read through the lines as 
well, missing keenly what was not there. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

' UOBERT," Mrs. Conover said one evening, as she sat 
sewing some dainty trifle for baby Bertie, who had come to 
be a great favorite with her grandmother, ' ' have you any 
idea that matters are not quite as they should be between 
Charlie andKathie?" 

Mr. Conover glanced up from his book, then down again, 
rather perplexed for an answer. 

" I fancy something is wrong. Kathie will not talk 
about it, but seems to evade it at every turn. I think," 
in a slightly wounded tone, " I am entitled to my child's 
confidence in this matter. Has she said anything to you ? " 

" We discussed a few points of duty, one morning," in 
a slow tone. It was a delicate matter. He could see just 
the lack of fine agreement on which Kathie and her mother 
would miss. 

" She has grown so so different; I should say grave, 
only she is bright and interested in all other matters. Yet 
a young girl's marriage one would think might be a great 
event to her, touching, as it does, all the deep chords of the 
soul." 

''It will be to her." 

He was thinking how he could smooth the way for his 
darling, for he could foresee there would be rough places. 

" Has it been put off for any cause? " 

" I do not know, Dora, that they have come near the 
real thing, the marriage." 

" But Charlie is settled, as one may say. And he could 
have been before if Kathie had cared." 





It must come some time The mother would be sadly 
hurt, angered, perhaps. Since the engagement, and the 
coming of baby Bertie, she had held her own child with 
a loose clasp, so to speak, ready to transfer her rights to 
another, the other she loved so well. 

" I believe the young people have made a mistake, and 
time only can right it. I was a little afraid from the 
beginning." 

"The engagement is not broken?" Mrs. Alston let 
her work fall, and her hands held themselves nerveless, 
while varied expressions seemed to flash over her face. 

' ' The engagement stands just as it did, for aught I 
know. But it seems to me Kathie is coming no nearer 
the vital joy and anticipation. I doubt if she is as near as 
on that first night. I suppose the question with her, with 
any thoughtful person, would be whether this is the love 
with which to prove a lifetime, to make the sum of all joys 
come right." 

" You never did cordially like it, Robert, and you will 
encourage her to give it up. Why, T wonder?" And the 
tears stood in Mrs. Alston's eyes. 

"My dear Dora, you are mistaken m some points. I 
was surprised, and a little afraid that it might be nearness, 
the tender feeling of the boy and girl who had always been 
friends, and whose hopes, beliefs, and aims were much 
alike. I think she could choose no better man if she 
searched the world over. And if it had gone on to com- 
plete fruition " 

"You don't think the winter with Aunt Ruth, with 
Bruce, changed anything?" she interrupted. 

" I do not think it consciously changed anything. I do 
not believe Kathie has any thought of Bruce in her heart 
that she could not show the whole world, and if Bruce 
cared deeply he kept his feelings well under control. 
Besides, he grew very fond of Charlie ; but we will let all 
that alone. The only point to be considered is, whether 





Kathie loves Charlie sufficiently to maKe a happy, con- 
tented marriage." 

"But, Robert, are these feverish, extravagant loves to 
be preferred ? Look at poor Rob's sad mistake ; yet I sup- 
pose he thought he loved Miss Weeks madly." 

" I have no more faith in mad loves, certainly." And a 
rather sad smile crossed his face. 

" What do you want, then ? What does Kathie want ? " 
she asked rather sharply. 

" What Kathie wants is to love with her whole heart and 
soul, which she has not done yet. Think a little of all this 
time of probation. Even that first year a girl in love 
would have found many shy, sweet ways of seeing her 
lover alone a moment." 

"But they were both very true and honest. I liked it 
in him," she answered decisively. 

"It was extremely honorable in him. Yet we should 
have forgiven Kathie some little aside, a quick blush, or a 
girl's longing. This troubled me, I must confess. And 
when they came to the time of declared lovers it was just 
the same. They are near and tender friends * but her heart 
does not beat or her pulse quicken when he comes. No 
sweet, tell-tale blood flushes her face. There is no steal- 
ing away into corners for a word, no lingering as if the 
moments were precious. Dora, go back to your own girl- 
hood and remember what it was to you." 

Her face softened and a delicate flush stole over it, while 
the eyes drooped almost girlishly. 

" But Kathie is different." 

" What should make her so different? She is a sweet, 
fond, ardent girl, quickly moved by her emotions, tender, 
responsive, capable of much that is highest and best in 
life, in joy, in enduring happiness. Why should she not 
taste the brimming cup of that sweet satisfaction ? " 

" And if she should be deceived in her ideal? In Char-
