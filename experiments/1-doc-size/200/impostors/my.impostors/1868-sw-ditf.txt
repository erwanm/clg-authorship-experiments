height of the hill. There we sat down. The westering sun was
casting lines of light all over the landscape, which would be
soon floods of colour. Papa and I sat down to look and wait.

"It certainly is worth coming for," said papa. "Our journey
realises more than all I had hoped from it, Daisy."

"I am so glad, papa!"

"But you, Daisy, how is it with you? You seem to me a little,
and not a little, distraite."

"I have so much to think of, papa."

"More than I have?"

"Why, yes, papa," I said, half laughing. "I think so."

"You must have fields of speculation unknown to me, Daisy."

"Yes, papa. Some time I want to talk to you about them."

"Isn't now a good time?" said papa, carelessly.

I was silent a while, thinking how to begin. It was a good
time, I knew, and I dared not let it pass. I had been waiting
till Mr. Dinwiddie should have left us and papa and I be quite
alone; and he was to join us again as soon as we started on
our northward journey. Now was my best opportunity. All the
more, for knowing that, my heart beat.

"Papa," I began, "may I ask you a few questions, the better to
come at what I want?"

"Certainly. Your questions, Daisy, I have always found
stimulating."

"Then first, what is it you think of most, in looking over
from this place to Jerusalem?"

"Of course," said papa, rousing himself, "the prominent
thought must be the wonderful scene that was acted there
eighteen hundred years ago; not the course of history before
or after. Is that what you mean?"

"I mean that, papa. I mean the death of Christ. Papa, what was
that for?"

"Why, as I understand it, Daisy, it was a satisfaction to the
justice of God for the sins of the world. Are you going to put
me through a course of theology, Daisy?"

"No, papa. But do you think it was for all the world, or only
for a part of them?"

"For all, of course. The Bible words I take to be quite clear
on that point, even if it were possible that it should have
been otherwise."

"Then it was for you and me, papa?"

"Yes."

"And for those ignorant Moslems that live in the city now?"

"Yes, of course it was; though I think they will not have much
good of it, Daisy."

"Never mind that, papa. Then it was for my old June, and for
Maria and Darry and Pete and Margaret, and all the rest of our
people at Magnolia?"

"Yes," said papa, rousing up a little. I did not look at him.

"Papa, don't you think the Lord Jesus loves the people for
whom He died?"

"Certainly. It is inconceivable that He should have died for
them if He did not love them. Though that is also a great
mystery to me, Daisy."

"Papa, don't you think that, having died for them, He holds
them precious?"

"I suppose so," said papa slowly.

"Every one?"

"Yes."

"Do you think He loves one man less than another because his
skin is darker?"

"Certainly not, Daisy."

"Then papa - should we?"

"I do not know that we do," papa said, after a pause.

"Papa, think. What would you say to our, or anybody's, holding
white men in slavery - making them work without wages - and
forcing them to obey under the lash?"

"They are an inferior race, Daisy," papa answered again after
a pause. His voice showed he did not enjoy the conversation;
but it was needful for me to go on.

"Papa, they have been kept down. But suppose they were
inferior, - since Christ died for them, does He not love
them?"

"I have no doubt of it."

"Then, papa, what will He say to us, for keeping those whom He
loves and died for, at arms' length or under our feet? and
what will He say to us for keeping them out of the good He
died to give them?"

"We do not, Daisy! They have their religious privileges."

"Papa, I have lived among them as you never did. They may not
meet together to pray, on pain of the lash. They cannot have
Bibles, for they are not allowed to read. They have no family
life; for husbands and wives and parents and children are
parted and torn from each other at the will or for the
interest of their owners. They live like the animals."

"Not on my estates!" said papa, rousing himself again. "There
is no selling and buying of the people there."

"Pete's wife was forcibly taken from him, papa, and then sent
South."

"By whom?"

"By Edwards. And the rest of the hands were in mortal fear of
him; utterly cowed. They dared not move without his pleasure."

"Abuses," papa muttered; - "nothing to do with the system."

"What must the system be where such things are possible? where
one such thing is possible? And oh, papa, they suffer! there
is no such thing as real comfort of life; there is no scope or
liberty for the smallest upward tendency. Nothing is their
own, not their own time; they have no chance to be anything
but inferior."

"They have all the essentials of comfortable living, and they
are comfortable," said my father.

"Papa, they do not think so."

"Few people do think so," said papa. "It is a vice of
humanity."

I was silent a little bit, and then I ventured to say, -

"Papa, the Lord Jesus loved them well enough to die for them."

"Well," said papa, rather growlingly, "what then?"

"I am thinking, what will He say to us for handling them so."

"What would you do for them, Daisy?"

"All I could, papa," I said softly.

"How much could you, do you suppose?"

"Papa, I would not stop as long as there was anything more to
be done."

"I suppose you would begin by setting them all free?"

"Wouldn't you wish it, papa, for yourself and me, if we were
two of them? - and for mamma and Ransom, if they were two
more?"

"You are mistaken in thinking it is a parallel case. They do
not wish for liberty as we should."

"Then it only shows how much harm the want of liberty has done
them already. But they wish for it quite enough, papa; quite
enough. It breaks my heart to think how much they do wish for
it."

"My child, you do not know what you are talking about!" papa
answered; half worried, I thought, and half impatient. "In the
first place, they would not be better off if they were set
free; though you think they would; and in the second place, do
you know how it would affect our own condition?"

"Papa," I said low, - "it has nothing to do with the question.
I do not care."

"You would care."

"I care for this other more, papa."

"Daisy, understand. Instead of being well off, you would be
