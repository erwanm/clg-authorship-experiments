" What you have said would be mortal sin, my 
daughter, were it not that you are laboring under 
strong and natural excitement; and I shall absolve you freely when you have done the penance 
I must impose. You have always been such a 
good child that I am able to forgive you even in 
this terrible moment. But, my daughter, surely 
you know that this marriage can never take 
place " 

"It shall! It shall! '' 

" Control yourself, my daughter. You cannot 
bring this man into the true church. His character is long since formed and cast — it is iron. Even 
love will not melt it. Were he younger '' 

" I should hate him. All young men are insufferable to me — always have been. I have 




found my mate, and have liim I will if I have to 
hide in the hold of his ship. Ah, padre mio, I 
know not what I say. But you will help me. Only 
you can. My father thinks you as wise as a saint. 
And there are other things — my head turns round 
— I can hardly think — but you dare not lose the 
friendship of this Eussian. And my marriage 
to him would be as much for the good of the Mis- 
sions as for California herself. If you champion 
our cause, point out that not only would it be a 
great match for me, but that many ends would 
be lost by ruining my life, the Governor will find 
himself in a position to grant your prayers for 
the cargo, particularly if you first persuaded my 
father — so long they have been friends, the Gov- 
ernor could not resist if he joined our forces. 
"What is one girl that she should be held of greater 
account than the welfare of this country to which 
you are devoting your life! The happier are 
your converts the more kijidly will they take to 
Christianity — which they do not love as yet ! — the 
more faithful and contented will they be, in the 
prospect of the luxuries and the toys and the 
trinkets of the Eussian north. What is one girl  
against the friendship of Eussia for Spain? Who 
am I that I should weigh a peseta in the scale? " 




" You are Conclia Argiiello, the flower of all 
the maidens of California, and the daughter of 
the best of our men,' replied Father Abella 
musingly. " And until to-day there has been no 
Catholic more devout " 

' ' It lies with you, mi padre, whether I continue 
to be the best of Catholics or become the most 
abandoned of heretics. You know me better than 
anyone. You know that I will not weaken and 
bend and submit, like a thousand other women. I 
could be bad — bad — bad — and I will be ! Do you 
hear? '' And she shook his arm violently, while 
her hoarse voice filled the church. 

" My child ! My child ! I have always believed 
that you had it in you to become a saint. Yes, yes, 
I feel the strength and maturity of your nature, 
I know the lengths to which it might lead an- 
other ; but you could not be bad, Conchita. I have 
known many woinen. In you alone have I per- 
ceived the capacity for spiritual exaltation. You 
are the stuff of which saints and martyrs are 
made. The violent will, the transcendent passions 
— they have existed in the greatest of our saints, 
and been conquered. ' ' 

" I will not conquer. I — Oh, padre — for the 
love of heaven '' 




He left the box hastily and lifted her where she 
had fallen and carried her into the room adjoining the church. He laid her on the floor, and ran 
for Doha Ignacia who, refreshed with wine and 
chocolate, came swiftly. But when Concha, under 
practical administrations and maternal endearments, finally opened her eyes, she pushed her 
mother coldly aside, rose and steadied herself 
against the wall for a moment, then returned to 
the church, closing the door behind her. 

When a woman has borne thirteen children in 
the lost corners of the world, with scarce a thought 
in thirty years for aught else save the husband 
and his comforts, it is not to be expected that her 
wits should be rapiers or her vocabulary distinguished. But Doiia Ignacia 's unresting heart 
had an intelligence of its own, and no inner convulsion could alter the superb dignity of mien 
which Nature had granted her. As she rose and 
confronted Father Abella he moved forward with 
the instinct to kiss her hand, as he had seen 
Eezanov do. 

" Mi padre,'' she said, " Concha is the first 
of my children to push me aside, and it is like a 
blow on the heart; but I have neither anger nor 
resentment, for it was not the act of a child to 
its parent, but of one woman to another. Alas! 




this Eussian, what has he done, when her own 
mother can give her no comfort! We all love 
when young, but this is more. I loved Jose so much 
I thought I should die when they would have 
compelled me to marry another. But this is more. 
She will not die, nor even go to bed and weep for 
days, but itns more. I should not have died, I 
know that now, and in time I should have married 
another, and been as happy as a woman can be 
when the man is kind. Concha will love but once, 
and she will suffer — suffer — She may be more 
than I, but I bore her and I know. And she cannot marry him. A heretic ! I no longer think of 
the terrible separation. Were he a Catholic I 
should not think of myself again. But it cannot 
be. Oh, padre, what shall we do! '' 

They talked for a long while, and after further 
consultation with Don Jose and Father Landaeta, 
it was decided that Concha should remain for the 
present in the house of Juan Moraga, where she 
could receive the daily counsels of the priests, 
and be beyond the reach of Eezanov. Meanwhile, 
all influence would be brought to bear upon the 
Governor that the Eussian might be placated even 
while made to realize that to loiter longer in California waters would be but a waste of precious 
time.

Theke was no performance after all in the Pre- 
sidio square that night, for the bear brought in 
from the hills to do honor to the Eussians died 
of excitement, and it rained besides. Eezanov 
made the storm his excuse for not dining and 
dancing as usual at the house of the Comandante. But the relations between the Presidio and 
the Juno during the next few days were by no 
means strained. Davidov and Khostov were always with the Spanish officers, drinking and card 
playing, or improving their dancing and Spanish 
with the girls, whose guitars were tuned for the 
waltz day and night. The dignitaries met as usual 
and conversed on all topics save those paramount 
in the minds of each. Nevertheless, there were 
three significant facts as well known to Rezanoy 
as had they been aired to his liking. 

He had sought an interview with Father Abella, 
and tactfully ignoring the question of his marriage, had persuaded that astute and influential 
priest to make the proposition regarding his cargo 
that Concha had suggested. The priest, backed 



 

by his three coadjutors, had made it, and been repulsed with fury. From another quarter Kezanov 
learned that during his absence little else was discussed in the house of the Comandante save his 
formidable matrimonial project, and the supposed 
designs of his country. Troops had been ordered 
from the south to reinforce the San Francisco garrisons, and were even now massed at Santa Clara, 
within a day's march of the bay. 

About a mile from the Presidio and almost opposite the Jimo's anchorage were six great stone 
tubs sunken in the ground and filled by a spring 
of clear water. Here, once a week, the linen, fine 
and heavy, of Fort and Presidio was washed, the 
stoutest serving women of households and barracks meeting at dawn and scrubbing for half a 
day. Rezanov had watched the bright picture 
they made— for they wore a bit of every hne they 
could command— with a lazy interest, which 
quickened to thirst when he heard that they were 
the most reliable newsmongers in the country. In 
every Presidial district was a similar institution, 
and the four were known as the " Wash Tub 
Mail. ' ' Many of the women were selected by the 
tyrants of the tubs for their comeliness, and each 
had a lover in the couriers that went regularly 




witli mail and official instructions from one end 
of the Californias to the other. All important 
news was known first by these women, and much 
was discussed over the tubs that was long in reaching higher but no less interested circles ; and do- 
mestic bulletins were as eagerly prized. The 
sailor that brought this information to Eezanov
