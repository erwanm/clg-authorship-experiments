Yesterday afternoon, being worried and wearied with the day before, I
left your letter, as you see, and teased Ida to go out driving with me
in the Park. She had promised Effie St. Clere to sketch some patterns of
arbors and garden seats that are there, for her new place at Fern
Valley, and I had resolved on a lonely ramble to clear my heart and
brain.

Moreover, the last time I was there I saw from one of the bridges a very
pretty cascade falling into a charming little wooded lake in the
distance. I resolved to go in search of this same cascade which is deep
in a shady labyrinth of paths.

Well, it was a most lovely perfect day, and we left our carriage at the
terrace and started off for our ramble, Ida with her sketch-book in
hand. She was very soon hard at work at a rustic summer-house while I
plunged into a woody tangle of paths guided only by the distant sound of
the cascades. It was toward evening and the paths seemed quite solitary,
for I met not a creature. I might really have thought I was among the
ferns and white birches up in Conway, or anywhere in the mountains, it
was so perfectly mossy and wild and solitary. A flock of wild geese
seemed to be making an odd sort of outlandish noise, far in a deep, dark
tangle of bushes, and it appeared to me to produce the impression of
utter solitude more than anything else. Evidently it was a sort of wild
lair seldom invaded. I still heard the noise of the cascade through a
thicket of leaves, but could not get a sight of it. Sometimes it seemed
near and sometimes far off, but at last I thought I hit upon a winding
path that seemed to promise to take me to it. It wound round a declivity
and I could tell by the sound I was approaching the water. I was quite
animated and ran forward till a sudden turn brought me to the head of
the cascade where there was a railing and one seat, and as I came
running down I saw suddenly a man with a book in his hand sitting on
this seat, and it was Mr. Henderson.

He rose up when he saw me and looked pale, but an expression of
perfectly rapturous delight passed over his face as I checked myself
astonished.

"Miss Van Arsdel!" he said. "To what happy fate do I owe this good
fortune!"

I recovered myself and said that "I was not aware of any particular
good fortune in the case."

"Not to you, perhaps," he said, "but to me. I have seen nothing of
you for so long," he added, rather piteously.

"There has been nothing that I am aware of to prevent your seeing me," I
said. "If Mr. Henderson chooses to make himself strange to his friends
it is his own affair." He looked confused and murmured something about
"many engagements and business."

"Mr. Henderson, you will excuse me," said I, resolved not to have this
sort of thing go on any longer. "You have always been treated at our
house as an intimate and valued friend; of late you seem to prefer to
act like a ceremonious stranger."

"Indeed, you mistake me, entirely, Miss Van Arsdel," he said, eagerly.
"You must know my feelings; you must appreciate my reasons; you see
why I cannot and ought not."

"I am quite in the dark as to both," I said. "I cannot see any reason
why we should not be on the old footing, I am sure. You have acted of
late as if you were afraid to meet me; it is all perfectly unaccountable
to me. Why should you do so? What reason can there be?"

"Because," he said, with a sort of desperation, "because I love you,
Miss Van Arsdel. Because I always shall love you too well to associate
with you as the wife or betrothed bride of another man."

"There is no occasion you should, Mr. Henderson. I am not, so far as I
understand, either wife or betrothed to any man," I said.

He looked perfectly thunderstruck.

"Yet I heard it from the best authority."

"From what authority?" said I, "for I deny it."

"Your mother."

"My mother?" I was thunderstruck in my turn; here it was to be sure.
Poor mamma! I saw through the whole mystery.

"Your mother told me," he went on, "that there was a tacit engagement
which was to be declared on Mr. Sydney's return, and cautioned me
against an undue intimacy."

"My mother," I said, "has done her utmost to persuade me to this
engagement. I refused Mr. Sydney out and out in the beginning. She
persuaded me to allow him to continue his attentions in hope of changing
my mind, but it never has changed."

He grew agitated and spoke very quickly.

"Oh, tell me, Miss Van Arsdel, if I may hope for success in making the
same effort?"

"I shouldn't be surprised if you might," said I.

There followed a sort of electric flash and a confusion of wild words
after this--really my dear I cannot remember half what he said--only the
next I knew, somehow, we were walking arm in arm together.

"What a talk we had, and what a walk up and down those tangled alleys!
going over everything and explaining everything. It was a bright long
twilight and the great silver moon rose upon us while yet we were
talking. After a while I heard Ida calling up and down the paths for me.
She came up and met us with her sketch-book under her arm."

"Ida, we're engaged, Harry and I," I said.

"So I thought," she said, looking at us kindly and stretching out both
hands.

I took one and he the other.

"Do you think I have any chance with your parents?" asked Harry.

"I think," said Ida, "that you will find trouble at first, but you may
rely on Eva, she will never change; but we must go home."

"Yes," said I, "it would not do to introduce the matter by getting up a
domestic alarm and sending a party to drag the lake for us; we must
drive home in a peaceable, orderly manner," and so, it being agreed
among us that I should try my diplomatic powers on mamma first, and
Harry should speak to papa afterward, we drove home.

Well, now Belle, it is all over--the mystery I mean; and the struggle
with the powers, that bids to begin. How odd it is that marriage, which
is a thing of all others most personal and individual, is a thing where
all your friends want you to act to please them!

Mamma probably in her day felt toward papa just as I feel, but I am sure
she will be drowned in despair that I cannot see Wat Sydney with her
eyes, and that I do choose to see Harry with mine. But it isn't mamma
that is to live with him, it is I; it is my fearful venture for life,
not hers. I am to give the right to have and to hold me till life's
end. When I think of that I wonder I am not afraid to risk it with any
man, but with him I am not. I know him so intimately and trust him so
entirely.

What a laugh I gave him last night, telling him how foolishly he had
acted; he likes to have me take him off, and seemed perfectly astonished
that I had had the perspicuity to read his feelings. These men, my dear,
have a kind of innocent stupidity in matters of this kind that is
refreshing!

Well, if I am not mistaken, there was one blissful individual sent home
in New York last night, notwithstanding the terrors of the 'stern
parents,' that are yet to be encountered.

How I do chatter on! Well, my dear Belle, you see I have kept my word. I
always told you that I would let you know when I was engaged, the very
first of any one, and now here it is. You may make the most of it and
tell whom you please, for I shall never change. I am as firm as Ben
Lomond.

  Ever your loving    EVA.




CHAPTER XXXV.

DOMESTIC CONSULTATIONS.


On the afternoon after the croquet party Aunt Maria Wouvermans and Mrs.
Van Arsdel, withdrawn to the most confidential recess of the house, held
mysterious council.

"Well, Nelly," said Aunt Maria, "how did you think things looked
yesterday?"

"I thought a crisis was impending, but after all nothing came. But you
see, Maria," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "that girl! she is the most
peculiar creature. She wouldn't give him the least chance; she just held
herself away from him. Two or three times I tried to arrange that they
should be alone together, but she wouldn't. She would keep Susan and
Jane Seaton at her elbow as if they had been glued to her."

"It was so provoking," said Aunt Maria, "because all the Elmores were
there watching and whispering. Those Elmores are in such an elated state
on account of the wedding in their family. You'd really think it was a
royal marriage at the very least; and they whisper about and talk as if
we had been trying to catch Sydney and couldn't; that's what provokes
me! they were all on tiptoe watching every turn, and I did long to be
able to come down on them with an announcement! What ails Eva? Of course
she must mean to have him; no girl at her age would be fool enough to
refuse such an offer; you see she's three-and-twenty."

"Well, if you'll believe me, Eva actually went and gave that croquet pin
Sydney gave her to Sophie Elmore! I overheard her urging it on her, and
he overheard it too, and I know he didn't like it; it was so very marked
a thing, you see!"

"Eva gave that pin to Sophie Elmore! The girl is crazy. She is too
provoking for anything! I can't think what it is, Nelly, makes your
girls so singular."
