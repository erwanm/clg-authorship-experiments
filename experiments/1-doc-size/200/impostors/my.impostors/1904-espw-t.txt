" The polyaphron ! " interrupted Philip, 
" what a delicious name ! I suppose that 
means all kinds of a fool?" 

"Does it?" said Mrs. Jeffries. "Just 
listen. * The polyaphron is found only in 
one cave in the world. It has rudimentary 
wings, and it is supposed that in prehistoric 
times it could have flown out if it had de- 



 

sired. It is born nearly blind, and dies 
wholly so.' " 

Mrs. Jeffries laid down her book and looked 
over her spectacles at the young attorney — 
a thing which he had never seen her do 
before. It made her look suddenly an old 
woman. 

"My dear boy," she observed, with that 
half-whimsical affectionateness which ahvays 
commanded the young man's chivalry, " I 
was born too early, or you too late. If you 
had been studying law when I was a young 
lady, I should have taken you myself — that 
is, if I had never met Mr. Jeffries, and if you 
had asked me." 

" Which," said Philip gallantly, " you may 
rest assured, madam, that I should have done 
— or else, despairing, envied Mr. Jeffries." 

" Gracefully answered," pursued Mrs. Jef- 
fries placidly, " like yourself — and like your 
father, too. Here 's Miriam ! You two run 
and get your dinner, while I finish my poly- 
aphron." 

" Is it possible," thought Philip, " that she 
extemporized that ? I shouldn't have given 
her credit for it." He put his hand out for 



 

the book, but Aunt Cornelia laughed, and 
turned it face down upon her lap. 

She read no more in that remarkable scien- 
tific volume which had served perhaps a bet- 
ter purpose than it ever had before, or would 
again. Her eyes did not follow the young 
people ; but her mouth had the wistf ulness 
that age feels for youth, and loneliness for 
life. 

When Miriam and Philip sat down together 
opposite each other in the bright dining-room 
Philip uttered a low exclamation. 

In the soft penumbra of the rose-shaded 
candles she seemed to arise before him as the 
spectrum had arisen from the sea, in a sud- 
den sheen of color — the first that he had 
seen her wear since her father died. This 
miracle was nothing more nor less than a 
prismatic summer silk, but to the young man 
she seemed to be clothed in a rainbow. 

They talked little and lightly, and by a 
mutual instinct sought the presence of a third 
as soon as possible. But when they got back 
to the lace-covered lamp, Aunt Cornelia was 
not there. They sat down in the large empty 
room in something like constraint. Philip 



 

found himself monotonously repeating, — 
" The polyaphron is born nearly blind, and 
dies wholly so." 

Miriam was restless, and shimmered over to 
the long window, where she stood looking out 
upon the water. 

The dead August night was breathless and 
soundless. Scarcely a sigh crept up the cliffs. 
On Miriam's face rested the expression which 
the man who should win her would never see. 
Like all women whose thoughts are high, and 
whose years are young, she had never con- 
sidered the nature of a second love. It would 
not be too much to say that she had never 
thought of it as for her a possible experience. 
She had reached the inevitable emergency of 
a fine and ardent soul that has given its first, 
but not its noblest passion. 

She had reversed the great quotation. She 
had begun by loving Love. If she loved again, 
she would love the lover. If she did so, if 
she could do so, where was the dream of her- 
self, which is dearer to such a woman than 

j°y ? 

A subtle allegiance, though to a misguided 
feeling, oppressed her. There were times when 



 

a sense of something almost mystical disturbed 
her ; winds had speech and tides language ; 
the sea lifted arms as if it would drag her ; 
from the spaces between the stars peremptory 
tones addressed her inarticulately ; the atmos- 
phere inclosed her as if it clasped; she seemed 
to be hunted by a thwarted, but still relent- 
less will. 

" Do you mind my coming, too ? " asked 
Surbridge. 

Philip had the personality that will elect 
to lose rather than to win by intrusion. The 
heart that would not give itself to him hap- 
pily he would disdain to capture ; he had 
never spoken a commanding word to Miriam ; 
he had treated her with the quiet strength 
which has no need to assert itself ; he had 
never lacked in consideration, but he had 
never urged her will. Sometimes Miriam 
had thought that the woman to whom Philip 
should offer his chartered affection " for sun 
and candlelight " would be exceptionally cher- 
ished. 

Now, when he spoke, she turned a gentle 
invitation. Her manner was without anima- 
tion, as her eyes were without hope. She ex- 



 

perienced the profound, unnatural weariness 
of one who in a baffled struggle for freedom 
had shattered herself against an imprisoning 
attraction. To that captivity she had been mis- 
directed by force ; now, her sensibility looked 
everywhere for the trodden roads of tender- 
ness. All she could think of in the world that 
she wanted was kindness — the daily shelter 
of a safe character ; she craved common com- 
fort, she needed simple rest, as though she 
had been a much older woman than she was. 
It seemed to her as if her youth had been 
stunned ; she came back gravely to conscious- 
ness of it. She found herself inhaling life 
slowly, and with a certain reluctance foreign 
to her healthy, joyous temperament. She 
knew she must breathe the sympathy that 
she could trust. 

Her old friend's firm but lenient nature 
seemed to encroach upon hers. Her heart 
leaned towards his bosom. But was this love ? 
She felt as if only he could answer, or teach 
her how to do so. 

" Do you remember," asked Philip quietly, 
" telling Dan — that night — that I always 
found everything I wanted ? " 



 

" No," said Miriam, " you haven't got it 
right. I said you found everything you 
tried to." 

Then the crimson dismay of a woman un- 
wooed fled across her face. She remembered 
that Philip had never spoken a word of love 
to her, not one. 

" But, dear, I have loved you all my life," 
he began.
