without either we or our guards being obliged to leave them. They
pulled us through thickets and woods, and at last we found ourselves
on the top of a high hill. We could not conceive what possible object
the Japanese could have in drawing across the land, with so much
trouble, boats of no inconsiderable size. We concluded, at last, that
they must have seen our vessel, and feared lest they should lose their
prize. But the solution of the riddle was soon apparent, for when they
had got the boats up to the top of the hill, they allowed them to
slide down the other side by the force of their own gravity, and then
launched them on a small stream, which, after having navigated for two
days, we left in order to continue our journey by land. They loosened
the bands from our legs, and having drawn on our boots, asked us
whether we would walk or be carried in litters, by which name they
designated boards, some four feet in length, fastened to ropes, by
which they were borne along. We chose to walk, and accordingly the
chief formed the procession. First walked two of the natives, side by
side, with red staves in their hands, who pointed out the way. After
them came three soldiers, and then myself. On one side of me walked a
soldier, and on the other a servant, who, with a green bush, brushed
the flies from me. After me walked a guard, who held the rope that
bound me, and then followed people bearing my litter. In the same
manner, Moor, Chleb Nikow, and the sailors, were led along, and the
procession closed with soldiers and a crowd of servants, who carried
the baggage and provisions. Each one of the latter had fastened to his
girdle a small wooden tablet, marked so as to designate to which of us
he was attached, and what was his duty. During the whole of the
journey, the Japanese preserved the same order, and the day was spent
in the following manner: At dawn we prepared to start, breakfasted,
and set out on our march. At the villages through which we passed, we
generally stopped to rest, to drink tea, and smoke tobacco. At noon we
dined. An hour after dinner, we started again, and two or three hours
before sunset halted for the night, generally in some village, or
where a garrison lay. Immediately on our arrival, we were led to the
chief's dwelling, and seated on benches, until that magnate reviewed
and mustered us. We were then taken to a house appropriated to us, and
bound fast to iron clamps. Afterwards they pulled off our boots, and
washed our feet with salt and water. We ate regularly three times a
day; in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Our food varied very
little, consisting of rice-broth, instead of bread, with salted
radishes, instead of salt, a mess of greens, balls of pastry, or
roasted fish. Sometimes we received mushroom soup, and a hard boiled
egg. The food was not measured out to us, but each one was at liberty
to eat as much as he pleased. Our drink was generally bad tea, without
sugar, and sometimes, though rarely, beer. In this manner we were
taken to our place of destination, which was as yet unknown to us.

By degrees they loosened the ropes, which had been put round our
necks, and when, after a time, a man of higher rank took the command
of our party, he permitted our hands to be untied, so that we could
feed ourselves. Only when we were carried across some strait or river,
did they bind us so unmercifully tight, and this did not happen often,
nor last long. Our conductors were very careful of us, and carried
their caution and watchfulness so far, that for a long time they would
not suffer us to approach the shore. However, as we pleaded hard to be
allowed to do so, because we could walk so much easier on the wet
sand, they at last gave a reluctant consent, taking care to keep
between us and the water, even where they were obliged to wade in it.
When, also, they allowed us to smoke pipes, they held them with both
hands, or fastened to the mouth-pieces wooden balls of the size of
hen's eggs, for they seemed to imagine that if we were not restrained,
we would choke ourselves with them. We laughed heartily at this
proceeding, and made them understand, by signs, that it was much
easier to strangle ourselves with these balls than with pipe-stems. At
this they laughed too, but told us that they had most positive orders
to prevent us in every possible way from committing suicide. They were
so very anxious about our health, that they watched us from the tops
of our heads to the soles of our feet, carried us across the smallest
brooks or puddles, and asked us every morning how we felt.

On the eighth of August, we arrived at Khakodade, a large town, which
they told us was to be our abode for the present. An immense multitude
came forth to meet us. The road was lined on both sides with
spectators, but they behaved themselves very soberly, none of them
betraying in their looks, as I saw to my satisfaction, either hatred,
scorn, or malicious pleasure; still less did they attempt to annoy us
with either mockery or outrage. After we had passed through the town
gates, and a long and very narrow street, we turned into a by-lane,
and saw on a high piece of ground before us, which was surrounded by
an earthen wall and thick-set hedge, and guarded by armed soldiers, a
building which was, perhaps, to be our prison during life.

As soon as we entered we were mustered by an officer, according to the
instructions given him by the captain of our guards, and then led
farther into the court, where we saw a large, dark shed, in which
stood cages made of strong bars of wood, and resembling bird-cages in
every thing but size. After the Japanese had taken counsel among
themselves for some time, as to how they should dispose of us, they
led me along a passage, and forced me to go into one of the little
apartments, which was partitioned off by means of wooden posts. I
looked around for my companions, and judge of my horror, when I found
that they had vanished. After the guards had taken off my bonds, and
also, taken off my boots, they fastened the door of my cage, without
saying a word, and left me to myself. The thought that I was separated
from my comrades, overcame me, and I threw myself on the ground in
despair.


III.

I had lain there, almost unconscious, for some time, when I perceived
a man at the window, who, by signs, invited me to approach him. As I
did so, he handed me through the grating, a couple of little sweet
cakes, and signified to me that I was to eat them quickly, without
letting any one see me do so, for if that was to happen it might be
all the worse for him. Although at this moment I felt a positive
aversion towards all kinds of food, yet with a great exertion, I
gulped them both down, because I did not wish either to anger or
injure him. He now left me, with a pleased countenance, promising to
provide me in future, with the same kind of food. I thanked him as
well as I was able, and wondered not a little, that a man, who to
judge from his appearance, was of the lowest rank in life, should
possess so much goodness of heart, as to resolve on comforting a
stranger, at his own peril. Pretty soon they brought me food, but as I
had not the least appetite, I sent it back untouched, as I did again
in the evening.

One object now wholly occupied my thoughts, and that was my escape
from imprisonment. With this view I examined my cage very carefully.
It was six feet long, about as broad, and some eight feet high.
Tolerably thick beams separated it from the passage, and in the wall
were a couple of windows, having on the outside, a strong wooden
grating, and within, paper curtains which could be rolled up or let
down. From one of these windows you looked out on a wall about two
feet distant, but the other commanded a beautiful view of mountains,
fields, and the sea. All the furniture which the apartment could boast
of, was a little bench, so small that one could hardly lie down on it,
and some mats spread out on the floor.

I was thoroughly convinced that with the aid of an ordinary knife, it
would be very easy to cut through the wooden grating of the window,
and that in a dark night, I could, with very little difficulty, find
my way into the court-yard and over the wall. But then, where was the
knife to come from, when they had not trusted us with even a needle?
And suppose that I was lucky enough to escape, whither could I turn my
steps? The fear too of aggravating the already hard lot of my
companions, turned aside any ideas which I might have entertained of
attempting a flight. Moreover, our guards were not by any means remiss
in their duties. During the whole night, I heard very plainly, people
walking round the walls, and striking the hours by means of a couple
of dry sticks. My attendants too came very often into the entry with a
light, in order to see what I was doing. Before night set in, they
brought me a thick cotton covering, and a night-gown, wide and wadded,
but which smelt so badly, as it was old and dirty, that I threw it
aside into one corner of my cage.

On the following morning, whilst every thing was yet still, I heard,
to my great joy, some Russian words very plainly pronounced. I sprang
up from the bench on which I was lying, and going to the window, which
looked out on the next building, heard midshipman Moor in conversation
with one of the sailors. Most fervently did I thank God for this
unexpected discovery, for I now knew that my companions not only were
under the same roof, but were not imprisoned in separate cells, and
had, therefore, opportunity for comforting each other, and making the
time appear shorter. After several days, during which the tedious and
solitary life I led had well nigh driven me to despair, there walked
into my cell a Japanese officer, whom I took to be of some rank and
importance. After lamenting that they had thus far been obliged to
confine me by myself, he agreeably surprised me by asking which of the
sailors I would like to have as a companion? I replied that they were
all equally dear to me, and that I wished to have them all with me in
turns; he immediately gave orders to have my wish attended to. I asked
him if the Japanese intended to treat us always in this manner?

"No," answered he; "in future you will all live together, and after a
while be sent home."

"Will this soon happen?" I asked.

"Not so very soon," replied he, shortly, and left without further
explanations.

Men who find themselves in a situation like ours, catch up every word,
and meditate on it closely. Had he said "soon," I would have regarded
his words as a mere attempt at consolation; but now I believed him,
and grew more contented. Hardly was this officer gone, when one of the
sailors was brought to me. The man was not a little astonished to see
what a pleasant apartment I had, and feasted his eyes on the objects
he saw from my window. My prison seemed a paradise compared to the
cells in which he and the rest had been put. These cells, it was
true, were built like mine, but far more narrow and penable, and they
stood one on the other in a kind of shed, so that there was a free
passage all round them. Instead of a door, they had an opening so low
that you had to creep through it. No friendly ray of light ever
penetrated to them, and they were surrounded by gloom and darkness.

The conversation I held with the sailor invigorated, in some degree,
the sorrow I felt, and I now ate the food that was brought to me for
the first time since our arrival at Khakodade. Our food now was worse
by far than when we were on our way to the town. They gave us by
turns, rice-broth, warm water, with grated radishes, but no herbs,
finely cut leeks, boiled beans, salted cucumbers, a soup with balls of
meal, made from beans and spoiled fish. Our drink was generally warm
water; sometimes, but seldom, they gave us poor tea, without sugar.
When we complained of this wretched fare to one of the officers of the
guard, he promised us meat, butter, and milk, but excused himself
afterwards, when we reminded him of his promise, by jocosely telling
us that the cows were still at pasture. When, in order to accomplish
our purpose in another manner, we feigned illness, he asked us, in a
sympathizing manner, what the Russians did when they were sick? and
what they ate?
