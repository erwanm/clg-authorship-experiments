and rebuked them. Being ashamed, they lied, and 
said they were married ; that they had been privately 
married. Then the old foreigner's hurt was healed, 
and he forgave and blessed them. After that, they 
were able to continue their sin without concealment. 
By and by the foreigner's wife died; and presently he 
followed after her. Friends of the family assembled to 
mourn ; and among the mourners sat the two young 
sinners. The will was opened and solemnly read. It 
bequeathed every penny of that old man’s great wealth 
to Mrs. George Johnson  

And there was no such person. The young sinners 
fled forth then and did a very foolish thing : married 
themselves before an obscure justice of the peace, and 
got him to antedate the thing. That did no sort of 
good. The distant relatives flocked in and exposed 
the fraudful date with extreme suddenness and sur- 
prising ease, and carried off the fortune, leaving the 
Johnsons very legitimately, and legally, and irrevocably 
chained together in honorable marriage, but with not 
so much as a penny to bless themselves withal. Such 
are the actual facts ; and not all novels have for a base 
so telling a situation. 



CHAPTER L. 

THE “ORIGINAL JACOBS rl 

WE had some talk about Captain Isaiah Sellers, now 
many years dead. He was a fine man, a high- 
minded man, and greatly respected both ashore and on 
the river. He was very tall, well built, and hand- 
some; and in his old age — as I remember him — his 
hair was as black as an Indian’s, and his eye and hand 
were as strong and steady and his nerve and judgment 
as firm and clear as anybody’s, young or old, among 
the fraternity of pilots. He was the patriarch of the 
craft; he had been a keelboat pilot before the day of 
steamboats; and a steamboat pilot before any other 
steamboat pilot, still surviving at the tim£ I speak of, 
had ever turned a wheel. Consequently, his brethren, 
held him in the sort of awe in which illustrious survi- 
vors of a bygone age are always held by their asso- 
ciates. He knew how he was regarded, and perhaps 
this fact added some trifle of stiffening to his natural 
dignity, which had been sufficiently stiff in its original 
state. 

He left a diary behind him ; but apparently it did 
not date back to his first steamboat trip, which was 
said to be 1811, the year the first steamboat disturbed 
the waters of the Mississippi. At the time of his death 
a correspondent of the St. Loins Republican culled the 
following items from the diary : 


In February, 1825, he shipped on board the steamer Rambler , at 
Florence, Ala., and made during that year three trips to New Orleans and 
back — this on the General Carrol, between Nashville and New Orleans. 
It was during his stay on this boat that Captain Sellers introduced the tap 
of the bell as a signal to heave the lead; previous to which time it was the 
custom for the pilot to speak to the men below when soundings we
wanted. The proximity of the forecastle to the pilot-hov' , no doubt, len- 
dered this an easy matter; but how different on one oi our palaces of the 
present day ! 

In 1827 we find him onboard the President, a boat of two hundred and 
eighty-five tons burden, and plying between Smithland and New Orleans. 
Thence he joined the Jubilee in 1828* and on this boat he did his first 
piloting in the St. Louis trade; his first watch extending from Herculaneum 
to St. Genevieve. On May 26, 1836, he completed and left Pittsburg in 
charge of the steamer Prairie , a boat of four hundred tons, and the first 
steamer with a state-room cabin ever seen at St. Louis. In 1857 he intro- 
duced the signal for meeting boats, and which has, with some slight change, 
been the universal custom of this day; in fact, is rendered obligatory by 
act of Congress. 

As general items of river history, we quote the following marginal notes 
from his general log : 

In March, 1825, General Lafayette left New Orleans for St. Louis on 
the low-pressure steamer Natchez . 

In January, 1S28, twenty-one steamers left the New Orleans wharf to 
celebrate the occasion of General Jackson’s visit to that city. 

In 1830 the North American made the run from New Orleans to 
Memphis in six days — best time on record to that date. It has since been 
made in two days and ten hours. 

In 1831 the Red River cut-off formed. 

In 1832 steamer Hudson made the run from White River to Helena, a 
distance ‘of seventy-five miles, in twelve hours. This was the source of 
much talk and speculation among parties directly interested. 

In 1839 Great Horseshoe cut-off formed. 

Up to the present time, a term of thirty -five years, we ascertain, by
reference to the diary, he has made four hundred and sixty round trips to New 
Orleans, which gives a distance of one million one hundred and four thou- 
sand miles, or an average of eighty-six miles a day. 

Whenever Captain Sellers approached a body of 
gossiping pilots, a chill fell there, and talking ceased. 


For this reason: whenever six pilots were gathered to- 
gether, there would always be one or two newly-fledged 
ones in the lot, and the elder ones would be always 
“showing off” before these poor fellows; making 
them sorrowfully feel how callow they were, how recent 
their nobility, and how humble their degree, by talking 
largely and vaporously of old-time experiences on the 
river; always making it a point to date everything back 
as far as they could, so as to make the new men feel 
their newness to the sharpest degree possible, and 
envy the old stagers in the like degree. And how 
these complacent baldheads would swell, and brag, 
and lie, and date back — ten, fifteen, twenty years, and 
how they did enjoy the effect produced upon the 
marveling and envying youngsters ! 

And perhaps just at this happy stage of the proceed- 
ings, the stately figure of Captain Isaiah Sellers, that 
real and only genuine Son of Antiquity, would drift 
solemnly into the midst. Imagine the size of the 
silence that would result on the instant ! And imagine 
the feelings of those baldheads, and the exultation of 
their recent audience, when the ancient captain would 
begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a 
reminiscent nature — about islands that had disap- 
peared, and cut-offs that had been made, a generation 
before the oldest baldhead in the company had ever 
set his foot in a pilot-house ! 

Many and many a time did this ancient mariner 
appear on the scene in the above fashion, and spread 
disaster and humiliation around him. If one might 
believe the pilots, he always dated his islands back to 
the misty dawn of river history ; and he never used 
the same island twice ; and never did he employ an 
island that still existed, or give one a name which 
anybody present was old enough to have heard of before. 
If you might believe the pilots, he was always 


conscientiously particular about little details; never 
spoke of “the State of Mississippi* for instance — 
no, he would say, “ When the State of Mississippi was 
where Arkansas now is”; and would never speak of 
Louisiana or Missouri in a general way, and leave an 
incorrect impression on your mind — no, he would 
say, “When Louisiana was up the river farther* or 
“When Missouri was on the Illinois side* 

The old gentleman was not of literary turn or 
capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of 
plain, practical information about the river, and sign 
them “Mark Twain* and give them to the New 
Orleans Picayune . They related to the stage and con- 
dition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; 
and thus far they contained no poison. But in speak- 
ing of the stage of the river to-day at a given point, 
the captain was pretty apt to drop in a little remark 
about this being the first time he had seen the water 
so high or so low at that particular point in forty-nine 
years; and now and then he would mention Island so 
and so, and follow it, in parentheses, with some such 
observation as “ disappeared in 1807, if I remember 
tightly* In these antique interjections lay poison 
and bitterness for the other old pilots, and they used 
to chaff the “ Mark Twain ** paragraphs with unsparing 
mockery. 

It so chanced that one of these paragraphs* became 
The original MS. of it, in the captain’s own hand, has been sent to me 
from New Orleans. It reads as follows: 

Vicksburg, May 4, 1859. 

“My opinion for the benefit of the citizens of New Orleans: The 
water is higher this far up than it has been since 1815. My opinion is that 
the water will be 4 feet deep in Canal Street before the first of next June.

and it has not been since 1815,

it broadly, very broadly, stringing my fantastics out to 
the extent of eight hundred or a thousand words. I 
was a “ cub ” at the time. I showed my performance 
to some pilots, and they eagerly rushed it into print in 
the New Orleans True Delta . It was a great pity; for 
it did nobody any worthy service, and it sent a pang
