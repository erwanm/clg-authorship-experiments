" My wife's sister is to stand," Dr. Kinnard said, when 
he had made arrangements for the service. " We have 
kept her for that." 

He had not the courage to call her "Daisy" to Mr. 
Dude's face. 

" We want you to come to tea. No one else will 
be in." 

" Very well. I shall be happy to." 

Nelty had mentioned the matter with unwonted trepida 
tion, ending rather meekly with, " If you do not mind." 

"Mind! Why should I?" 

Daisy Endicott meant to put a little careless surprise 
in her tone ; but it was not quite that. 

Mr. and Mrs. Endicott came over for the Sunday. A 
quiet, solemn service it was ; and they two stood strangely 
side by side, never once glancing at each other, but try - 
ing to think only of the little child, yet unconsciously 
taking a wider range, both, perhaps, understanding what 
ttuyr might have been to each other. 

She was very self-possessed at supper, neither coloring 
nor trembling when any incident brought them nearer. 
In truth, she wondered at herself. 

"It is because he has forgotten so complete!}*, " she 
thought. " He has forgotten, and it is better: one could 
not remember so long without any hope." 

On the Thursday following was the consecration. One 
of the church-wardens was to have a dinner prepared for 
the clergy. Mrs. Newbury had arranged to give them a 
supper, as there was to be a service at four. And if Miss 
Endicott would only come over, and help her about the 
entertaining ! 

"You are used to clergymen's wants and ways," she 
said. " I shall feel so much better and safer, if you are 
there." 

So Daisy went, and made herself not only useful, but 
agreeable. The girlish timorousness had been succeeded 



 

by a sweet and genial gracious ness, that forgets all about 
itself in rendering others at ease, and then learns that 
this is happiness. 

Arthur Dudley watched her. Not handsome and stately, 
like Mrs. Kinnard ; not with that dazzling wild-bird flutter 
and lightness of Queen Bess ; but a womanly serenity, a 
sort of everyday refinement and ease, as if it was no best 
garment for company, -just the one to adorn a clergy 
man's house, friend and companion for all time. 

The brethren sat until quite in the evening. Two or 
three were to take trains : two were to be Mr. Dudley's 
guests, and were sent home in the carriage. And, pres 
ently, they had all said good-night, save one. 

" Are you going, Miss Endicott? I want to walk over 
to Dr. Kinnard' s." 

" Oh, yes ! " she cried eagerly ; and then went for her 
hat. 

It was a soft, summer night, with a young moon rising 
tremulously over the tree-tops. Somewhere in the edge 
of the woods a whippoorwill sang, mingled with the note 
of a late homeward-going thrush or was she croon 
ing over her birdlings? Arthur Dudley drew her hand 
through his arm in that manly fashion of appropriation 
that somehow takes possession of a woman for the time. 
Once she stumbled over some half-bare tree-root grow 
ing across the path, and he caught her quickly. Both 
exclaimed "Oh!" with a little laugh, and, recovering, 
walked on. It broke the spell of silence ; and they went 
to saying amusing trifles to one another. 

Dr. Kinnard had just come in. He would drive Mr. 
Dudley, home, and they would have their talk going 
along. 

" Good-night! " she said, in a sort of joyous, ringing 
tone, as if she was at peace with every body. 

" I do believe she is still to be won," Arthur Dudley 
thought to himself. " Her heart has never been touched." 



 

He made some excuse to come over the next day. No, 
she had not changed, but was frank and genial, like her 
olden self. He would be wary, now, and win her by slow 
degrees. 

But after a little she had to return home. Bess's 
wedding was at hand, gay, enchanting Queen Bess, 
who was hardly more than a child. 

They all liked Eugene Mallory so much. Yet there 
was an awe in the thought of Bessie going away for 
years. The others had not fluttered so far, but that, now 
and then, they could look into the old home-nest. 

And then it sounded so curious to hear Mrs. Mallory 
settle what she was to have by saying, "You can pur 
chase such a thing in Paris for a mere trifle : I would 
not bother about it. I would not waste my time making 
dresses : }"ou can get them as }T>u want them, fresh, with 
out any of the crumpling of packing. I would not have 
this or that,'' until she narrowed the trousseau to the 
smallest dimensions. AVas it her delicate way of not 
taking much for Bessie now, when she was to have such 
an abundance afterwards? 

So she went to church in simple white, one morning, 
and came back Mrs. Mallory. There was a church full to 
be sure ; but they did not see any blaze of diamonds, 
or shimmer of pearls. There were some real orange- 
flowers in her hair, and a cluster on her bosom ; but she 
looked sweet and stately, as if she had come back to her 
child's name, and was a pure white lily. 

They had cake and wine and kisses. Mrs. Mallory was 
so dazzling in her old-lady brightness, that no one could 
be sad ; and she talked about the steamer, and the voyage, 
and the time of reaching Liverpool, with as much noncha 
lance as if she had said a palace-car and Niagara. They 
were to spend a day or two in New York. The Duncans 
went back with them in the afternoon. 

" I cannot believe it, mother," Mr. Endicott said as he 

sat in his quiet study after supper. " Only the other clay, 
she was a wild little thing. Don't you remember how 
she used to swing round, holding on my arm, and scam 
per off like a kitten? Let me see, how did it all begin? 
Stephen Duncan came here first, and asked me to take his 
brothers ; and then and then Mother, arc we grow 
ing old? It is so strange to have all these married daugh 
ters and their husbands ! It's a queer sort of addition, 
that, after all, leaves you but very little, I think : " and he 
paused to wipe his eyes with his white silk handkerchief. 
Mrs. Mallory had brought him a dozen, the best that 
could be found. 

Mrs. Endicott came around, and kissed him. 

"How fortunate tnat Edith was born! " with a rift 
of simple gladness. "For, you see, there will be many 
years before she is grown." 

The next thing for Nelly Kinnard was her step-daugh 
ter's return, a week or so before school began. Maud 
would not have confessed it to a living soul ; but she was 
really thankful to get away from Aunt Garland's dull 
house. Her hitherto narrow life and experience had 
widened somewhat ; while Aunt Adelaide, fretted and 
soured, drew closer within her shell, and was correspond 
ingly bitter, though she tried to assume a demeanor of 
lofty indifference. There were still many things in life 
that she could have made the best of, if it had been her 
nature to make the best of incongruous materials, to pick 
out bits of comfort and brightness among every-day inci 
dents ; but it was not, and never would be. And, all this 
time, she held a grudge against Dr. Kinnard, as if he, 
somehow, had forced her into her present dissatisfaction. 

Maud came from that austere, unloving house to her 
father's, so radiant with an atmosphere of kindliness. 
Bertie was quite a little gentleman. Grandmother might 
have a few childish ways, to be sure ; but they softened her, 
and were really no detriment. Dr. Kinnard evinced a 



 

decided disposition to be jolly. He was fall of odd little 
jests and half caresses : he no longer shut himself in his 
" den," and locked the door. The parlor was always 
open and inviting ; neighbors were dropping in with bits 
of outflowing social life ; and Mrs. Kinnard was in the 
midst, the sun around which they converged. 

"When Aunt Adelaide trained Maud in carping, critical 
ways, she little dreamed that the weapon might be
