never be jealous. 

“ That was a youthful dream. We both had 
to struggle somewhat for our education. And 
now I have reached a nice position and a good 
salary. I can lay by something every year, ‘ if 
no one comes to marry me,’ ” quoting With 
laughing eyes. “ It would be a wild, useless 
thing to throw up my opportunity since he 
does not truly need me. But we talk about it, 



or have, as brother and sister dear to each 
other often do, building air castles. But I 
really wanted him to marry, when the right 
woman came within his orbit. A clergyman, 
of all men, ought to be careful in this respect. 
A woman of the suitable kind can be a true 
helpmate, another may mar his work. His 
wife is differently placed from other women. 
Leslie has a rare quality, you may have re- 
marked it, of setting one at ease with a cor- 
diality that is not obtrusive nor yet promising 
too much, but winning, heartfelt.’ 

“ Oh, it charmed me the first time I met her. 
She took me in hand with friendliness, so much 
to a stranger in a strange place. No, she is not 
gushing, either,’ with a responsive smile. 

“ It will stand her in good stead as a clergy- 
man’s wife. And her principles are so high 
and firm, he will never drop down. You 
know we often pick out lovers and sweethearts 
for others. My choice lay between Leslie and 
you. Helen, I should have loved you fondly 
for a sister.” 

“ Oh, this is much better ! ” cried Helen 
with all humility. 


 

“We both thought you the beloved of an- 
other, — Willard Bell. I suppose you did not 
love him? ” 

“ Not in that way.” And then she recalled 
in her girlish fashion how she had measured 
the two men and found that in some high char- 
acteristics one distanced the other. 

“ Your turn will come some day. It is not 
wise to hurry these matters. Leslie will be a 
dear younger sister to me, and I shall always 
be welcome to their home. I do sincerely re- 
joice in the engagement, and I know they will 
be happy in doing the work God has set for 
them. See, there is some one signaling to you. 
Oh, it is Mr. Hildreth ! I met him at Professor 
Yarrow’s. What a fine strong man, — a gen- 
tleman ! ” 

They waited for him to rejoin them and had 
a pleasant chat. Then they met Mr. Howard 
and two delighted girls. Mrs. Howard was 
chaperoning them. Miss Craven had gone to 
a meeting, of which she was secretary. Mr. 
Morse and Leslie rejoined them presently. 

“ What pretty, well-bred girls,” Leslie said, 
“ and so enthusiastic. They are growing out 




of their shyness, but they do not betray the 
awkward age.” 

“No one could who was trained by Mrs. 
Aldred,” said Helen. If she could do some- 
thing like this for her girls ! 

They were going to a pretty, wholesome play 
that evening. Mr. Morse had secured four 
tickets for “ The Messiah.” Would not Helen 
go with them? 

She would be very happy to. 

“ I want you for Saturday’s matinee,” said 
Mr. Hildreth afterward. “ I have enjoyed 
your friends very much. I shall venture to 
call them mine hereafter. But I want a little 
bit of you for myself, to recall sometime when 
I sit alone. The opera is ‘ Lohengrin,’ and 
there are three exceptionally fine singers in it.” 

Helen flushed with pleasure. “ I shall be 
very glad to go,” she exclaimed eagerly. 

And it was delightful to sit quietly and 
glance up now and then to find him enjoying 
the same fine acting, or the glorious strain in 
the music. Every thing had seemed to be a 
little crowded. There were sweet and heart- 
felt talks with Leslie, who was looking for- 


 

ward not only to a life of happiness but useful- 
ness as well. The training of her busy girl life 
had confirmed her in habits of industry; she 
could not have spent hours in light and careless 
dreaming even if the dreams were sweet. 

Juliet had taken the girls home this after- 
noon. They had enjoyed a most fascinating 
time. 

“ I am glad they are going back to school 
or they would grow up altogether too fast, at 
least Wilma would. She does go so to the heart 
of everything. I only hope she will not exhaust 
the delights and have none left for woman- 
hood. I keep finding new things all the time,” 
smiling. 

So Helen had said good-by to them. The 
Morse party were to go early on Monday. 

“ For I want a feast day on Sunday, listen- 
ing to my brethren who have a surfeit of riches 
in this wonderful city,” said Mr. Morse. “ And 
then I shall distribute gladly, and try to give 
my people a taste of these good things.” 

Helen would be glad to have a quiet day 
with her dear Mrs. Bell, if she were allowed, 
she put in a sort of mental parenthesis. 




But now she dismissed all other thoughts 
and just devoted her soul to the mysterious 
sway of the music. Mr. Hildreth watched the 
face so instinct with understanding, not mere 
sensuous delight. How replete life would be 
with breadth and fineness if she were in the 
place of her rich friend ! Not but what Miss 
Craven’s life would be blest, and blessing all 
those about her, and make many hearts happy. 
Perhaps it would be nobler, no, it could hardly 
be that, but there was such a vigorous growth 
to this girl, there was a vivid life in the very 
atmosphere about her. 

“ Oh ! ” she cried, in her full rich voice 
tremulous with emotion. “ I want to thank 
you so much! I like some one who does not 
want to talk at such a time, but just listen and 
let the melody permeate every fiber of his or 
her being. And though you have heard it many 
times, I dare say, you are capable of making it 
seem fresh to yourself, and that gratified me.” 

He smiled. It was exquisite to be so well 
understood. 

When they left the trolley there was a short 
distance to walk. 


 

“ I am going back to-night,” Mr. Hildreth 
said. “ My holiday is over. Are you? ” 

“ On Monday. The first day of the ne\y 
year I shall devote to getting settled. I feel 
as if I had been in an enchanted country.” 

He felt the smile in her voice. 

“ I hope you have had a happy time, a time 
to remember. I shall come in to wish you a 
Happy New Year.” 

Then they shook hands lingeringly and 
parted.
