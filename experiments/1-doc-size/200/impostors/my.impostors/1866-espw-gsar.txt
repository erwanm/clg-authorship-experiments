soned Tom; everybody was talking about it, 
since that last defeat at the West; two of his 
own class-mates had left within a fortnight ; he 
felt so mean to stay at home. Sometimes his 
letters would come embellished with flags and 




shields and various national devices of Ids own 
painting; sometimes he copied for Gypsy cer- 
tain stirring patriotic songs which were popular 
in college, and privately instructed her to sing 
them to her father every night when he came 
home from the store. Once in a while he 
undertook a very particular appeal to his mother, 
but received for answer only a gentle, “ I am 
sorry, my son, but I agree with your father 
perfectly about this thing. We do not think it 
best for you to go till you are older and stronger. 
Then if you are needed, we would not keep you 
back a moment. Try to be a good boy, mean- 
time, and wait patiently.’- 

Finally Tom had to content himself with sly 
hints and innuendoes, and with the most remarkable 
patriotic orations, covering sixteen pages 
of note-paper, in which the Star-Spangled 
Banner and the American Eagle figured largely. 
These sublime abstractions were evidently intended
as a severe and dignified way of stinging 
the family conscience. In a confidential note 
to Gypsy, he said once what he had not said 



to any one else. “ You see, Gypsy, I ’m sick of 
college through and through. I haven’t taken 
the stand, nor behaved the way I meant to, and 
I wish I were out of it once for all.” 

So the winter passed, and the spring vacation 
came, and Tom with it. The army question 
had rather subsided, and they thought he had 
forgotten it. But once or twice, when the sub- 
ject was mentioned, GypvSy, looking up sud- 
denly, caught an expression in his eye which 
made her doubt and think. 

Somebody made up a party one bright day to 
visit Belden’s Falls, and Tom and Gypsy were of 
it. The Rowes were there, and the Guests, the 
Holmans, Miss Cardrew, and Mr. Guernsey, — 
nearly all the teachers and scholars of the High 
School, and many of Tom’s old friends. The 
day was charming, and the company was charm- 
ing, and the Falls were so interesting, Delia 
said. The ride was a long one, and led through 
sunny valleys where the early birds were singing, 
up rocky hills where the carriages jolted 
and the girls screamed, through patches of 


forest cooled by the snow that still lay in the 
hollows and under the shadow of the walls. 

They drove into the woods that surrounded 
the Falls, tied their horses, and voted to walk 
the rest of the way through the cool, damp 
shadow and the perfume of the pines. Not 
that they thought very much about perfume or 
shadow. Tom and Francis were telling college 
stories, and after the fashion of a party of very 
young people, they were fast getting into a 
“ gale,” when they turned a sudden corner and 
stopped. 

A flash of light, a roar, a dizziness, — and 
there it all was. A sheer fall of foam broken 
and tossed about by huge black, jagged rocks ; 
the stealthy under-current showing through in 
green, swift lines ; showers of spray falling in 
feathers, breaking in bubbles, flashing into 
silver, touched into gold ; and, spanning the 
roar and brightness and bewilderment, a tiny 
rainbow, quivering, like a thing imprisoned. 
Above, the terrible rushing on of the black 
current to its fall, through gorges and caverns. 



through sunlight and shade, — a thing untamed 
and untamable. Beyond, the tree-tops tossing, 
and a sky with silver clouds, 

“Oh, I never! Isn’t it sweet pretty? He 
he, ha I ” said Delia Guest. 


“ Elegant ! splendid ! Why, how 
handsome it is ! ” from Sarah. 

Gypsy had thrown off her hat, — she was 


sure she could not have told why, — and stood 
with it hanging by one string from her dropped 
hands, her face upturned, her eyes as still as 
a statue’s. 

“ Look at Gypsy Breynton ! ” said somebody, 
presently. “Why don’t you talk, for pity’s 
sake? ” 

“ Oh ! ” said Gypsy, with a jump ; “ yes, — I 
forgot. What was it you wanted? ” 

They looked to their hearts’ content, and 
looked again, and went away and came back 
and looked again ; they crawled round into the 
cave, and threw stones into the boiling vortex, 
and tried to measure the sides of the gorge with 
a fish-line, and crouched where they could feel 
the spray on their faces, and explored the 
wooded banks, and crossed the tiny foot-bridge 
that hung, old and trembling, over a chasm 
where the black water lay two or three hundred 
feet down. 


“ I feel so sorry for it,” said Gypsy, as she 
stood looking down, leaning rather recklessly 
on the frail railing. 

“ Sorry for it ! ” called Sarah, from a safe 
place on the bank, — she said that the bridge 
made her nervous. 

“ Why, it looks so like a great creature leap- 
ing along to be killed,” said Gypsy, under her
breath. Sarah stared, and wanted to know if 
she read that in a fairy story. 

“ Oh, look at Tom Breynton ! ” called one of 
the Holmans, suddenly. He had crawled to the 
very edge of the chasm, past some trees and a 
bush or two, and was sitting on a sharp, pro- 
jecting rock, both feet hanging down, and his 
hands in his pockets. Of course everybody 
exclaimed, and the girls screamed, which was, 
probably, exactly what Tom wanted. 

“Tom, I don’t like to look at you very 
much,” said Gypsy, quietly ; she had not any 
of that way which so many sisters have, of 
worrying Tom if she thought that he was doing a 
dangerous thing. She knew that he was old 



enough and sensible enough to take care of 
himself; and, further, that boys don’t like to be 
interfered with by their younger sisters “ before 
folks ; ” and, also, that boys will do things that 
girls cannot do, and dangerous things, and be 
hurt or not, as the chance may be, and that 
there is no more use in trying to stop them than 
there would be in putting down a little pine 
branch into that great writhing current, to dam 
it up. So she said what she had to say, and 
then let him alone. 

“Look the other way, then,’’ said Tom, 
coolly, leaning far over, with both hands in his 
pockets ; it did have an ugly look, — as if a 
breath would blow him off. 

Gypsy made him no answer, but she pressed 
forward instinctively to watch him, leaned 
heavily upon the railing, and it cracked with a 
loud, sharp noise. 

Tom heard it and sprang. Gypsy was on the 
shore at a bound, safe enough, and the bridge, 
too. Tom, with his hands encumbered, slipped 
and fell. 



There was a cry, — the vacant rock, — and 
horrible silence. 

Into it a groan broke, and Gypsy, leaning 
over with rigid face where all the rest had 
fallen back to make room for her, saw that the 
rock shelved and jutted eight feet down, into a 
narrow ledge. Tom, swinging by the bush 
with one free hand, had fallen here and lay 
helpless, one ankle sprained by a cruel twist in 
a crevice.
