imitates a row of machicolations. Carven chimneys 
and tall dormer windows, covered with imagery, rise 
from the roofs; turrets on brackets, of elegant shape, 
hang with the greatest lightness from the angles of 
the building. The soberness of the main lines, the 
harmony of the empty spaces and those that are 
filled out, the prominence of the crowning parts, the 
delicacy of all the details, constitute an enchanting 





whole." And then the Abbe speaks of the admirable 
staircase which adorns the north front, and which, 
with its extention inside, constitutes the principal 
treasure of Azay. The staircase passes beneath one 
of the richest of porticos, a portico over which a 
monumental salamander indulges in the most deco 
rative contortions. The sculptured vaults of stone 
which cover the windings of the staircase within, the 
fruits, flowers, ciphers, heraldic signs, are of the 
noblest effect. The interior of the chateau is rich, 
comfortable, extremely modern; but it makes no 
picture that compares with its external face, about 
which, with its charming proportions, its profuse yet 
not extravagant sculpture, there is something very 
tranquil and pure. I took a particular fancy to the 
roof, high, steep, old, with its slope of bluish slate, 
and the way the weather-worn chimneys seemed to 
grow out of it, like living things out of a deep soil. 
The only defect of the house is the blankness and 
bareness of its walls, which have none of those delicate 
parasites attached to them that one likes to see on the 
surface of old dwellings. It is true that this bareness 
results in a kind of silvery whiteness of complexion, 
which carries out the tone of the quiet pools and even 
that of the scanty and shadeless park. 



  



IX. 

I HARDLY know what to say about the tone of 
Langeais, which, though I have left it to the end of 
my sketch, formed the objective point of the first ex 
cursion I made from Tours. Langeais is rather dark 
and gray; it is perhaps the simplest and most severe 
of all the castles of the Loire. I don't know why I 
should have gone to see it before any other, unless it 
be because I remembered the Duchesse de Langeais, 
who figures in several of Balzac 's novels, and found 
this association very potent. The Duchesse de Lan 
geais is a somewhat transparent fiction; but the 
castle from which Balzac borrowed the title of his 
heroine is an extremely solid fact. My doubt just 
above as to whether I should pronounce it excep 
tionally grey came from my having seen it under a 
sky which made most things look dark. I have, how 
ever, a very kindly memory of that moist and melan 
choly afternoon, which was much more autumnal than 
many of the days that followed it. Langeais lies 
down the Loire, near the river, on the opposite side 
from Tours, and to go to it you will spend half an 
hour in the train. You pass on the way the Chateau 
de Luynes, which, with its round towers catching 
the afternoon light, looks uncommonly well on a hill 
at a distance; you pass also the ruins of the castle 
of Cinq-Mars, the ancestral dwelling of the young 
favorite of Louis XIIL, the victim of Richelieu, the 





hero of Alfred de Vigny 's novel, which is usually re 
commended to young ladies engaged in the study of 
French. Langeais is very imposing and decidedly 
sombre; it marks the transition from the architecture 
of defence to that of elegance. It rises, massive and 
perpendicular, out of the centre of the village to 
which it gives its name, and which it entirely domi 
nates; so that, as you stand before it, in the crooked 
and empty street, there is no resource for you but to 
stare up at its heavy overhanging cornice and at the 
huge towers surmounted with extinguishers of slate. 
If you follow this street to the end, however, you 
encounter in abundance the usual embellishments of 
a French village: little ponds or tanks, with women 
on their knees on the brink, pounding and thumping 
a lump of saturated linen; brown old crones, the tone 
of whose facial hide makes their nightcaps (worn by 
day) look dazzling; little alleys perforating the thick 
ness of a row of cottages, and showing you behind, 
as a glimpse, the vividness of a green garden: In 
the rear of the castle rises a hill which must formerly 
have been occupied by some of its appurtenances, 
and which indeed is still partly enclosed within its 
court. You may walk round this eminence, which, 
with the small houses of the village at its base, shuts 
in the castle from behind. The enclosure is not 
defiantly guarded, however; for a small, rough path, 
which you presently reach, leads up to an open gate. 
This gate admits you to a vague and rather limited 
pare, which covers the crest of the hill, and through 



  

which, you may walk into the gardens of the castle. 
These gardens, of small extent, confront the dark 
walls with their brilliant parterres, and, covering the 
gradual slope of the hill, form, as it were, the fourth 
side of the court. This is the stateliest view of the 
chateau, which looks to you sufficiently grim and gray 
as, after asking leave of a neat young woman who 
sallies out to learn your errand, you sit there on a 
garden bench and take the measure of the three tall 
towers attached to this inner front and forming sever 
ally the cage of a staircase. The huge bracketed cor 
nice (one of the features of Langeais) which is merely 
ornamental, as it is not machicolated, though it looks 
so, is continued on the inner face as well. The whole 
thing has a fine feudal air, though it was erected on 
the ruins of feudalism. 

The main event in the history of the castle is the 
marriage of Anne of Brittany to her first husband, 
Charles VIII., which took place in its great hall in 
1491. Into this great hall we were introduced by 
the neat young woman, into this great hall and 
into sundry other halls, winding staircases, galleries, 
chambers. The cicerone of Langeais is in too great a 
hurry; the fact is pointed out in the excellent Guide- 
Joanne. This ill-dissimulated vice, however, is to be 
observed, in the country of the Loire, in every one 
who carries a key. It is true that at Langeais there 
is no great occasion to indulge in the tourist 's weak 
ness of dawdling; for the apartments, though they 
contain many curious odds and ends of antiquity, are 





not of first-rate interest. They are cold and musty, 
indeed, with that touching smell of old furniture, as 
all apartments should be through which the insatiate 
American wanders in the rear of a bored domestic, 
pausing to stare at a faded tapestry or to read the 
name on the frame of some simpering portrait. 

To return to Tours my companion and I had counted 
on a train which (as is not uncommon in France) 
existed only in the "Indicateur des Chemins de Fer;" 
and instead of waiting for another we engaged a vehicle 
to take us home. A sorry carriole or patache it proved 
to be, with the accessories of a lumbering white mare 
and a little wizened, ancient peasant, who had put on, 
in honor of the occasion, a new blouse of extraordinary 
stiffness and blueness. We hired the trap of an energetic 
woman who put it "to" with her own hands; women 
in Touraine and the Blesois appearing to have the 
best of it in the business of letting vehicles, as well as 
in many other industries. There is, in fact, no branch 
of human activity in which one is not liable, in France, 
to find a woman engaged. Women, indeed, are not 
priests; but priests are, more or less, women. They 
are not in the army, it may be said; but then they are 
the army. They are very formidable. In France one 
must count with the women. The drive back from 
Langeais to Tours was long, slow, cold; we had an 
occasional spatter of rain. But the road passes most 
of the way close to the Loire, and there was some 
thing in our jog-trot through the darkening land, beside 
the flowing river, which it was very possible to enjoy. 



  



X. 

THE consequence of my leaving to the last my little 
mention of Loches is that space and opportunity fail 
me; and yet a brief and hurried account of that extra 
ordinary spot would after all be in best agreement with 
my visit. We snatched a fearful joy, my companion 
and I, the afternoon we took the train for Loches. 
The weather this time had been terribly against us: 
again and again a day that promised fair became hope 
lessly foul after lunch. At last we determined that if 
we could not make this excursion in the sunshine, we
