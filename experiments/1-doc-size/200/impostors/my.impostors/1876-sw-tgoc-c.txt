'Theories, and scientific business. Pray explain, Hazel.'

'I once heard a short lecture on magnetism,' said Miss Wych, all 
grave except the gleam in her eyes; 'and it occurred to me to put it 
to the proof. So I stood by the door and saw the people go in.'

Dr. Arthur laughed, but asked no further questions.

'Your true lovers of science are always ready to venture a good 
deal in the pursuit of it,' observed Dane drily.

Wych Hazel's lips curled with mischief.

'When I got in,' she said, 'before the reading, I heard a good deal 
about the reader. Most of it striking, and some of it new.'

'That at least all may hear,' remarked Dr. Arthur. 'Science may 
have its reserves; but public news about Dane!'

'It's very old indeed,' said the person concerned. 'Only new to this 
witness. May be safely passed over.'

If Mr. Rollo was good at reading faces, he might see that remarks 
about him were considered quite too much her own personal 
property to be repeated to anybody in the world but himself. Wych 
Hazel sat silent, stirring her coffee.

'We are ready to hear the rest,' he remarked with a smile. 'Go on to 
the broken arm. How did you get hold of that?'

'One of the children came for you. And somebody had to go,' she 
answered simply.

'And "somebody" had to keep the broken arm in place, I suppose. 
But how came you to think of doing that?' said Rollo, who all the 
while was looking after the comfort of his two guests in his own 
fashion of quick-eyed ministry.

'I did not, till I had the child in my lap,' said Hazel; 'and then I 
remembered all of a sudden something in one of my old 
Edgeworth story books. So I tried, and succeeded.'

'I wish every one read story books to as good purpose,' said Dr. 
Arthur. 'There is no describing from what you saved the child. But 
at first I suppose she made great resistance?'

'Very great.'Hazel did not want to enlarge upon that part of the 
subject. And here Reo entered.

'Ha, Reo! are you made up for your journey already?' said Rollo. 
'You can report to Mrs. Bywank that Miss Wych was too much 
fatigued to take the drive home; and bring the carriage over in the 
morning.'

Wych Hazel looked up, but her courage failed her for a protest. 
She was obliged to let the order stand.

The fire was bright, the coffee was excellent, the little party so 
oddly thrown together were happy in mutual confidence and 
sympathy. Such hours are not too common, and a certain kindly 
recognition of this one sat upon every face. Gyda was busy 
preparing a room for Miss Kennedy and had not joined them.

'How does the work of the world look to you, Arthur, from this 
corner?' said Dane, when they had subsided a little from supper to 
the consideration of each other.

'Every spot of true Christian work is a centre,' said his friend. 'The 
"corners" are for darknessnot light. Work is the most enticing 
thing in the world to me, Dane!'

'Gyda's fireside was the corner I meant,it's not dark just now!
and I was thinking, that from this nook of quiet the work looks 
easy. So it is! It is a hand to hand and foot to foot battle; but it is 
easy to follow the captain that one loves.'

'I don't know that it is always easy,' said Dr. Arthur; 'but it can be 
done. Once in a while, you know, we are sent to carry a redoubt 
with only his orders before us. The Lord himself seems to be in 
quite another part of the field.'

'That is, to those who do not know.'

'Of course. I speak only of the seeming. But I like the fight, and I 
like the struggle. I like to measure battlements and prepare my 
scaling ladders, and lead a forlorn hope. It suits me, I believe.'

'Battlements?' Hazel repeated. 'Do you mean heights of difficulty?'

'Guarded by depths of sin,' said Dr. Arthur.

Hazel looked from one to the other. Yes, she could like that too, if 
she were a man. How much could she do, being a woman?

'And that is all seeming too, Arthur,' his friend went on. 'Really, 
the fighter need never be out of that "feste Burg." I was thinking 
just now, not only that work looks easy, but that it looks small. 
Individual effort, I mean; the utmost that any one man can do. It is 
a mere speck. The living waters that shall be "a river to swim in," 
are very shallow yet; and where the fishers are to stand and cast 
their nets, it is a waste of barrenness. You have never been on the 
shores of the Dead Sea, Arthur; you do not know how a little 
thread of green on the mountain side shews where a spring of 
sweet water runs down through the waste.'

'What then, Mr. Rollo?' said Wych Hazel.

'It is such a tiny thread of life upon the universal brown death.'

'Is that what the world looks like to you?' said Hazel, wondering.

'And the work is even far smaller than that, if you look at it in its 
minute details. Did you ever read the life of Agnes Jones, Arthur?'

'Yes.'

'Prim lent me the book; and I found a good word in it the other 
day. The writer says, I cannot give you the exact words,"If we 
do every little thing that comes to us, God may out of our many 
littles make a great whole." Therein lies the very truth of our work. 
It is so in Morton Hollow. Not building schoolhouses or making 
villages; anybody can do that; it is the word of interest to one, the 
word of sympathy to another; the holding a broken arm; giving 
help and refreshment in individual cases. Love, in short, like the 
sun, working softly and everywhere. As those threads of green on 
the mountain side are made up of multitudinous tiny leaves and 
mosses, nourished by countless invisible drops of spray.'

'Working in all sorts of ways'said the Doctor; while Hazel sat 
thinking of the green that was beginning to line the banks of 
Morton Hollow. 'You may notice that a real spring goes literally 
wherever it can. Men may wall it in with stone channels, or force it 
into the air; but let it alone, it follows every possible opening. The 
deep main stream, and the little side rills, and the single drops that 
go each to a single leaf.'

Rollo looked up and smiled. 'There is Gyda coming to fetch you, 
Hazel.'

'Well,' said Hazel. 'And you will go on talking all sorts of things 
that I ought to hear.'

She rose up and stood looking down into the fire. The other two 
rose also and stood looking at her. It was a pretty picture. Gyda, a 
little apart, watched them all with her little bright eyes.

'But,' Hazel began again,'to do that,for every little drop to do 
thatthere must be a head of water. It is not the mere trickling 
down of something which happens to be at the top!'Whereupon 
the little fingers took an extra knot.

'Each drop may do the ministry of one, may it not?' said Rollo. 
'You need not count the drops. The only thing is that they be living 
water.'

'Yes, the living water comes with a will. I remember,in Mme. 
Lasalle's brook,how busy the drops were. Not in a hurry, but in 
such sweet haste.'

'True!' said Dr. Arthur. 'Each with a clear bright purpose, if not a 
plan.'

'Perhaps, best not the plan,' said Rollo.

She stood gravely thinking for a moment, then looked up and 
shook hands with Dr. Arthur, wishing him good night. But no 
words came when she gave her hand to Mr. Rollo; onlyperhaps 
in default of wordsa beautiful, vivid blush.

The room to which the old Norsewoman conducted her was a very 
plain little place, with whitewashed walls and the simplest of 
furniture. Gyda manifested some concern lest her guest should 
suffer for want of a fire. 'But the gentlemen had to have the other 
room,' she said.

'O the fire is no matter,' said Hazel. 'But where do you sleepwith 
such a houseful?'

'I have my little nest just by, my lady. I'd be glad to keep it! And 
yet this is a strange place for my lad to have his home; and it's 
been his home now for a year, nearly. How much longer will I 
keep him, my lady?'

Gyda asked the most tremendous questions with a sort of 
privileged simplicity; she looked now for her answer.

'Keep him?'Hazel repeated the words in a maze.

'Yes, my lady. I know I must lose my lad from this home; but 
when is it to be?'

'A great whileI don't know,nobody knows,' said Hazel very 
much disturbed. 'Nobody thinks anything about it yet. So you need 
not even recollect it, Mrs. BoÃ«rresen.'

Gyda looked at her with a tender, incredulous, pleased smile upon 
her face. 'Do you think he will wait a great while, my lady?' she 
said. And then she came up and kissed Wych Hazel's hand, and 
went away.
