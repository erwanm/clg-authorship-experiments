been blind and proud. But if my love will comfort 
you, it is all yours now." 

"No." There was a little thrill of delight in her 
voice, too. " I don't want it all, Stephen. The old, 
jealous torture has died away, and I am coming to 
peace, rest. I am not ungrateful, nor ruled by any 
mean, sullen spirit. Heaven knows I ought to have 
done with all such now. And I take my share of your 
love gladly." 

" Which must be all, Joe. Let me make amends for 
the past, wherein I have made you suffer. Until God 
separates us " 

She guessed what he would have said, for her wo- 
man's intuition had been quickened. She placed her 
hand gently over his lips. 

" No, Stephen. Hope's place must be kept sacred, 
if she never comes to fill it. But she will. And hav- 
ing your love, I am content." 

" You don't quite understand it," he said, gently. 
" When I told my love, I did not dare repeat the story. 
I had a misgiving of the shock it would cause her. 
God did not mean that she should be mine." 

" We don't know what God means until it comes. 
We have only to wait. I told you before that I could 



 

not fill your heart, and a name was nothing. But you 
are princely generous, Stephen." 

"Will you take the gift?" 

"No," softly and tearfully. "Only love me to the 
end." 

They clasped hands in the silence, coming nearer to 
each other then than ever before in their whole lives. 
And both hearts yearned for the absent one. 

Far into the night Stephen Dane sat and watched his 
cousin. When the wind died down he fanned her 
gently, and with tenderest hands put aside the heavy 
hair clustering about her temples. Poor Joe, how hard 
life had been with her ! 

The next day Stephen consulted an eminent physi- 
cian. It was, as he had feared, too late for recovery. 
But Joe no longer cared for life. 

The shock and her remorse made fearful inroads upon 
her enfeebled frame. She amended a little, so that she 
came down stairs, and walked about the garden. Every 
day Stephen took her to drive. Such lovely haunts as 
he found, full of the later summer's greenery and fra- 
grance ! Rambles through quiet lanes, or by the wind- 
ing river ; tender talks, for there was nothing withheld 
now. It seemed to Joe as if she was entering heaven 
almost before her time. 

As the days wore on, an odd wish came to her. She 
wanted to see the clergyman who had read the funeral 
service that had so deeply impressed her. Stephen 



 

found him easily a Mr. Leighton, a stranger in the 
place, who had been at his post barely two months. 

A very curious mood took possession of Joe on this 
afternoon. She begged Katy to braid her hair as 
Hope used, and wreathe stems of Madeira blossoms in 
it. Her snowy wrapper was as faultless as Katy's 
fond care could make it, and the loving heart insisted 
upon her being adorned with a knot of scarlet ribbon 
at her throat "Jest as dear Miss Hope used to 
fix it." 

Joe sighed. 

" I 'clare, Miss Joe, you look handsome as a pic- 
tur' ! " 

The coming death was giving her a strange beauty. 
The features were large and irregular, but the eyes 
held in them a wonderful light ; the skin was trans- 
parent, with a slight fever flush on the cheeks. She 
had subsided into a languor of movement that was 
grace, compared with her former abruptness, and her 
voice had grown low and soft. Sitting in an easy- 
chair by the open window, she watched the vines 
swaying idly in the light air, until Katy announced, 

"Mr. Leighton." 

The young man paused an instant, then walked 
directly over to her, holding out his hand frankly. 

"Do not rise," he said in the tone she recognized so 
well. " I am glad to find you able to enjoy this lovely 
day. Have I not seen you before ? " 



 

"I was at the chapel nearly a month ago, at a 
funeral," she answered. 

" Yes, I remember now. You were kneeling, and 
your paleness attracted me. I was a stranger, and 
hardly knew the congregation." 

" I don't know why I went that day ; I was very 
wretched. Something in your voice soothed me, and 
I wanted to hear you talk again." 

"Thank you." He glanced away from her for a 
moment to a picture in an oval frame, hanging in the 
recess by the chimney. It was an exquisite ivorytype 
of Hope. She noted the direction of his eyes, and 
glanced also. 

" Is she not lovely ? " Joe asked involuntarily. 

He rose and approached nearer. "Yes," he an- 
swered. "I think I met her in Baltimore a Miss 
Hope Forsyth, is it not?" 

The room whirled round to Joe's dazed brain. 
Hope so near ! Hope given back tp Stephen ! O, 
no ! she must be dreaming. 

" Pardon me," he began, surprised at her agitation ; 
but Joe interrupted him with an eager, tremulous 
voice, 

" You have seen her ! Is she alive safe ? Can you 
find her again for me ? " 

" If it is the lady I mean " 

"When did you see her?" 

"First in April. I was assistant at a church in 



 

Baltimore. She came to stay with Dr. Cutter ; at 
least, that is where I met her. But I heard her sing 
in church, one morning, and such a glorious voice one 
never forgets ; " and Mr. Leighton's eyes wandered 
absently out on the porch, his memory returning, as it 
often did, to Hope Forsyth. 

" O Hope ! my darling, my darling ! " Joe rocked 
herself to and fro, and repeated the words softly, while 
Mr. Leighton, strangely puzzled, glanced from her to 
the picture. 

" Can you find her for me ? " The tone and face 
were alike sharp and eager. 

"I don't understand " 

" No ; how should you ? " Joe made a long pause 
to collect her scattered thoughts. What should she 
tell this stranger? 

" She was the ward of my cousin Mr. Stephen 
Dane a sacred charge to him. I sent her away; 
God forgive me !. I had something else to tell you 
to ask you. There was a tender pity in your voice 
that day at the funeral. I've dreamed of it so often ! 
I felt that I wanted some one to be just so tender and 
pitiful to me, for the way is thorny and tangled, and I 
cannot find any straight path. It will not be long 
before I'm done with it alL" 

"If I can help you try me, be frank with me. 
We stumble over so many hard things in life ! " 

The voice found its way to her heart. For a mo- 



 

ment she struggled with tears; then, steadying her
