tunes. Some were forgotten and dried up, 
some had too much nursing, others were left to 



take their chance. One girl had splendid luck 
with a pot of sweet alyssum that was a mass of 




white bloom. There were hyacinths, crocuses, 
geraniums, primroses, and the ordinary plants 
that did not require a wide knowledge. Alice 
had chosen a Bermuda lily. They were not as 
plentiful then as now. Last Spring she had 
spent a month at Bermuda with her parents 
and had fallen in love with the sweet white 
blossoms. She had studied the soil, she had 
never neglected it a day, and it had thriven 
wonderfully. Such a stout stalk, such deep- 
green leaves and then a bud head growing 
larger and larger, showing white in their long 
points, just ready to burst open. It was almost 
like a living thing to her and somehow sug- 
gested tall, pale mamma. She put it at the 
other end of the window to catch the last rays 
of light and stood a chair a short distance away 
while she went to Mrs. Allen’s for her cloth 
skirt that had a bad tear. Mrs. Allen mended 
and sometimes made garments for the girls. 

There were two very plain rooms, a sleep- 
ing chamber and living room, neat as a new

pin. And there was little Sadie Allen, who 
years ago had been thrown out of a wagon and 
crippled so that she seldom left the wheeling- 

 


chair. When her mother was out sewing the 
days were very long to her. 

‘‘I hope they will send me some of the 
church flowers to-morrow,’’ she said wistfully. 
‘*Or it will be Monday, I suppose, when they 
send them around to the hospital, and the 
orphans, and the old ladies. We had a gera- 
nium, but mother let it get frosted. And it 
must be just lovely to have a lot of flowers to 
keep Easter with. Why, it would be almost 
like heaven, where 

“ ‘Everlasting Spring abides 
And never withering flowers.’ ” 

Alice drew a long breath. Could she make 
an Easter offering of her firstfruits, her two 
lovely lilies that would open their white gates 
and show their golden treasures to celebrate 
the resurrection morning? No one has 
thought of poor little Sadie Allen. There 
would be more lilies out afterward, for her — 
but she should feel so proud of them all day 

 


long. She had meant to carry it down in the 
library where the girls spent Sunday after- 
noon talking with Mrs. Trevor. 

Then she looked at the pale little girl with 
longing, wistful eyes, who had so few delights. 

“I ’ll bring you two beautiful lilies in the 
morning,” she began hurriedly, lest she should 
repent. “I don’t believe you have ever seen 
anything like them, and they are so delicately 
fragrant. You can have them all day long and 
you can imagine you are in church.” 

The child caught Alice’s hands and kissed 
them rapturously, but she could not speak, 
and then Alice bent over and kissed her and 
said good-by in a tremulous voice, hurrying 
away so moved that her own eyes were filled. 

She went to her room and hung her skirt 
in the closet, then crossed to the window. O, 
what had happened! The two big lily buds 
lay on the .floor, one had opened. Had there 
been some untoward condition loosening them 
before their time ? What was this — she picked 
up a note with one corner folded, directed to 
Miss May Anderson. 

The tempest rose mountains high and she 
caught the chair to steady herself. Her tem- 
ples throbbed, the blood surged in her ears, 
she could have smashed May’s lovely vase, or 
torn to fragments the photograph she valued 
so highly. But she stood quite still. If she 
had conquered other times, could she not do 
it now? Mamma would be so glad. May 
could n’t have been so cruel as to have done 
such a deed wilfully. And now Alice remem- 
bered that May had made a great many efforts 
at carefulness. Not an article of her’s was 
lying round. She stooped and picked up her 
lilies and somehow could n’t forbear kissing 
them. Sadie could have them to-morrow 
morning all the same since they were not 
crushed or broken. Then she finished up her 
little tablet with a victory. It was better, oh 
so much better than the wild passion of anger. 
She would listen to May’s explanation and try ' 

 


not to say one angry word. Then the supper 
bell rang. 

May Anderson had come in to put up her 
hair afresh — it was often coming down. She 
went straight to the mirror and flung her golf 
cape on the chair with such force it nearly 
toppled over, but she caught it. And then she 
saw the mischief she had done and stood 
aghast for an instant. O, what could she do! 

She was going out with Jennie King to buy 
some Easter gifts. Instead she went to the 
florist. ‘‘Every Easter lily was engaged; he 
could have sold twenty more if he had been 
smart enough to raise them.” There was 
another place and she trudged over to that. 
Not one could be had for love or money. 

“But several of mine are only hired,” the 
man said. “Now on Tuesday I could sell 
you one.” 

“Save the most beautiful one you have, and 
send it to Mrs. Trevor’s on Tuesday.” There 
was an end to all other Easter gifts, for lilies 
came high at that time. 




She was late for supper. How lovely and 
tranquil Alice Dane looked. She was red and 
flurried. 

Then they brought their lists of endeavors 
to Mrs. Trevor. There was a grate fire in the 
library, and as Mrs. Trevor read she smiled 
and commended every one with a verse from 
the Bible, and the red flame swallowed up the 
confession. 

“He that ruleth his spirit is better than he 
who taketh a city,’^ came to Alice. How many 
times mamma had said that to her. 

Then they had a delightful talk, a sort of 
conference meeting before they said good 
night. 

“I don’t know how you can ever forgive me 
for breaking your lily,” cried May as she 
entered the room. “I never thought of it 
being in this corner. But this was your chair 
and I had no business to throw my cape over 
it. Oh, Alice, don’t keep so still. Call me 
anything! Say the worst things you can; I 




deserve them all. Even a saint would be 
angry !” 

“I ’ve been trying,” and Alice’s voice was all 



“They had a delightful talk ”
