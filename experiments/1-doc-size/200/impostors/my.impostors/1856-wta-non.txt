bound copy of the same work morocco, full gilt 
and handed it to our hero. 

" I shall make you a present of this. Are you an 
admirer of Moore ? ' 

" No, sir ; not exactly that is, I don't know 
much about it ; but Annie Lee does, and I want to 
get the book for her." 

Bobby's cheeks reddened as he turned the leaves 
of the beautiful volume, putting his head down to the 
page to hide his confusion. 

" Annie Lee ? " said Mr. Bayard with a quizzing 
smile. " I see how it is. Rather young, Bobby." 

" Her father has been very good to me and to my 
mother ; and so has Annie, for that matter. Squire 
Lee would be a great deal more pleased if I should 
make Annie a present than if I made him one. I 
feel grateful to him, and I want to let it out some 
how." 

" That's right, Bobby ; always remember your 
friends. Timmins, wrap up this book." 

Bobby protested with all his might ; but the bookseller
insisted that he should give Annie this beautiful 
edition, and he was obliged to yield the point. 

That evening he was at the little black house again, 
and his mother examined his ledger with a great deal 
of pride and satisfaction. That evening, too, another 
ten dollars was indorsed on the note, and Annie re- 
ceived that elegant copy of Moore's Poems. 



 



CHAPTER XIV. 
IN WHICH BOBBY'S AIR CASTLE is UPSET, AND 

TOM! SPICER TAKES TO THE WOODS. 

DURING the next four weeks Bobby visited various 
places in the vicinity of Boston ; and at the end of 
that time, he had paid the whole of the debt he owed 
Squire Lee. He had the note in his memorandum 
book, and the fact that he had achieved his first great 
purpose afforded him much satisfaction. Now he 
owed no man any thing, and he felt as though he 
could hold up his head among the best people in the 
world. 

The little black house was paid for, and Bobby was 
proud that his own exertions had released his mother 
from her obligation to her hard creditor. Mr. Hard- 
hand couM no longer insult and abuse her. 

The apparent results which Bobby had accom- 
plished, however, were as nothing compared with 




the real results. He had developed those energies 
of character which were to make him, not only a 
great business man, but a useful member of society. 
Besides, there was a moral grandeur in his humble 
achievements which was more worthy of consideration 
than the mere worldly success he had obtained. Mo- 
tives determine the character of deeds. That a boy 
of thirteen should display so much enterprise and 
energy was a great thing ; but that it should be dis- 
played from pure, unselfish devotion to his mother 
was a vastly greater thing. Many great achievements 
are morally insignificant, while many of which the 
world never hears mark the true hero. 

Our hero was not satisfied with what he had done, 
and far from relinquishing his interesting and profit- 
able employment, his ambition suggested new and 
wider fields of success. As one ideal, brilliant and 
glorious in its time, was reached, another more bril- 
liant and more glorious presented itself, and demanded 
to be achieved. The little black house began to appear 
rusty and inconvenient; a coat of white paint.would 
marvellously improve its appearance ; a set of nice 
Paris-green blinds would make a palace of it ; and a 



 

neat fence around it would positively transform the 
place into a paradise. Yet Bobby was audacious 
enough to think of these things, and even to promise 
himself that they should be obtained. 

In conversation with Mr. Bayard a few days be- 
fore, that gentleman had suggested a new field of 
labor ; and it had been arranged that Bobby should 
visit the State of Maine the following week. On the 
banks of the Kennebec were many wealthy and im- 
portant towns, where the intelligence of the people 
created a demand for books. This time the little 
merchant was to take two hundred books, and be 
absent until they were all sold. 

On Monday morning he started bright and early 
for the railroad station. As usual, he called upon 
Squire Lee, and informed Annie that he should proba- 
bly be absent three or four weeks. She hoped no 
accident would happen to him, and that his journey 
would be crowned with success. Without being 
sentimental, she was a little sad, for Bobby was a 
great friend of hers. That elegant copy of Moore's 
Poems had been gratefully received, and she was so 
fond of the bard's beautiful and touching melodies, 

that she could never read any of them without think- 
ing of the brave little fellow who had given her the 
volume ; which no one will consider very remarkable, 
even in a little miss of twelve. 

After he had bidden her and her father adieu, 
he resumed his journey. Of course he was thinking 
with all his might ; but no one need suppose he was 
wondering how wide the Kennebec River was, or how 
many books he should sell in the towns upon its 
banks. Nothing of the kind ; though it is enough 
even for the inquisitive to know that he was thinking 
of something, and that his thoughts were very inter- 
esting, not to say romantic. 

" Hallo, Bob ! " shouted some one from the road 
side.

Bobby was provoked ; for it is sometimes very un- 
comfortable to have a pleasant train of thought inter- 
rupted. The imagination is buoyant, ethereal, and 
elevates poor mortals up to the stars sometimes. It 
was so with Bobby. He was building up some kind 
of an air castle, and had got up in the clouds amidst 
the fog and moonshine, and that aggravating voice 
brought him down, slap, upon terra firma. 



 

He looked up and saw Tom Spicer seated upon the 
fence. In his hand he held a bundle, and had evi- 
dently been waiting some time for Bobby's coming. 

He had recovered from the illness caused by his 
broken arm, and people said it had been a good les- 
son for him, as the squire hoped it would be. Bobby 
had called upon him two or three times during his 
confinement to the house ; and Tom, either truly re- 
pentant for his past errors, or lacking the opportunity 
at that time to manifest his evil propensities, had 
stoutly protested that he had " turned over a new leaf," 
and meant to keep out of the woods on Sunday, stop 
lying and swearing, and become a good boy. 

Bobby commended his good resolutions, and told 
him ty3 would never want friends while he was true to 
himself. The right side, he declared, was always the 
best side. He quoted several instances of men, whose 
lives he had read in his Sunday school books, to show 
how happy a good man may be in prison, or when all 
the world seemed to forsake him. 

Tom assured him that he meant to reform and be 
a good boy ; and Bobby told him that when any one 
meant to turn over a new leaf, it was " now or never." 



 

If he put it off, he would only grow worse, and the 
longer the good work was delayed, the more difficult 
it would be to do it. Tom agreed to all this, and was 
sure he had reformed. 

For these reasons Bobby had come to regard Tom 
with a feeling of deep interest. He_ considered him 
as, in some measure, his disciple, and he felt a per-
