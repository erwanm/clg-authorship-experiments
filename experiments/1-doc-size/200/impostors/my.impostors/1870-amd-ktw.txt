“Mamma,” she exclaimed that afternoon, as she 
was sewing away very industriously, “ could you 
afford to buy me a new dress too ? ” 

Mrs. Alston did not reply immediately. 

“ I suppose you couldn’t ” ; and Kathie’s voice 
as well as her face fell a little. 

“ I really can’t afford to get Eob’s clothes. His 
being sick has spent me a good deal of time when I 
might have worked ; then the extra fire consumed 


so much coal that I must get another ton next 
week. There ’s the doctors hill also.” 

“O mamma, if we weren’t quite so poor I ” 
Katliie’s lip quivered, and before she was aware 
a tear dropped. 

“ My darling,” her mother said, “ I am so sorry 
to disappoint you. I think Bob needs his clothes 
the most ; and I shall order them at Mr. Brown’s 
and pay for them as I can. I haven’t the money 
to spare now to buy you a dress ; and your scarlet 
one still looks very nice. The white one, I suppose, 
is altogether too small.” 

“ And there ’s that great tear in the skirt, you 
know. Yes, I ’d rather wear the scarlet.” 

It was a severe trial to Kathie. The scarlet 
dress had been her only nice one all winter ; and 
Lottie Thorne, who had quantities of pretty clothes, 
had declared that she must have a new dress or 
she would not go ; she would be ashamed to be 
seen in any of her old ones at such a place as the 
Darrells’. 

What if she didn’t go ? A great pang seized 

her heart. Oh, she wanted to so much ! Miss 
Jessie had treated her as if she were the greatest 


 


lady in the land ; and if it didn’t make any dif- 
ference to her, why should she mind ? But would 
she be happy when she saw the rest looking so 
gay and pretty ? 

Kathie had many anxious moments on the subject. 
She knew she ought to be content, and she tried 
hard ; yet, in spite of her efforts, wishes and un- 
comfortable feelings would rush over her heart. 
Sometimes she felt that it would be better to give 
it up, then she thought she should be quite ashamed 
to say to Miss Jessie that she stayed at home because 
she had no new dress to wear. She wouldn’t call 
that very brave ; and Kathie seemed to have a 
consciousness that it was a very mean kind of pride. 

She hoped no one would ask her what she meant 
to wear, and she managed to evade a confession of 
her poverty until Monday. Then Lottie Thorne was 
seized with a teasing fit and bantered her ungener- 
ously. 

“ She means to outshine us all, so she won’t tell. 
White satin, I suppose, and lace and diamonds. 
You ’ll be the star of the evening.” 

“ But you have a new dress, Kathie,” said one of 
the girls. “Tell her and stop her talking.” 


 


Kathie choked down a big lump in her throat, 
and felt as if she must cry. 

“ I haven’t any new dress at all,” she said, des- 
perately. 

“ You don’t mean to wear that old scarlet thing ? ” 
was the next disdainful question. 

“ If I go I shall have to, for I can’t have any 
other.” 

Kathie summoned all her courage to utter that, 
and then she resolved to stay at home. Rob made 
his appearance on the scene just then, so the girls 
desisted from their tormenting. 

“ Come, Kathie,” he said, rather gruffly, “ let ’s go 
home.” 

Such an invitation was very unusual from Rob, 
and Kathie was glad to get away, even if the shelter 
of his wing did look rather threatening. 

“ You ’re a little fool, Kathie,” he began, angrily. 
“ What did you want to tell them for, and have them 
all laughing at you ? ” 

“ I couldn’t help it, Rob ” ; and there was a great 
tremble in Kathie’s voice. “ Besides, it was the 
truth, and I think we ought not to be ashamed of 
that. But — I believe I won’t go.” 


 


“ Yes, you must ; Charlie would be awfully disap- 
pointed if you did n’t, and then he doesn’t care half 
so much for fine things as you girls.” 

That was rather cruel. “ I ’m sure I wouldn’t 
care if the rest didn’t make fun of me ” ; and Kathie 
failed to choke off the sob this time. 

Rob was silent, for conscience gave him a hard 
pinch. He remembered how glad Kathie had been 
about his new clothes, and how pleased she always 
was to see him enjoy himself. And here he had 
talked crossly to her and had been angry when she 
was not at all at fault. 

“ Kathie,” his voice had a softened inflection, as if 
he was almost crying, and he slipped his arm around 
her waist very gently, — “ Kathie, I don’t seem to 
have much luck making war on my giants. I re- 
solved, when I was sick, that I would never be cross 
or rough to you again, and I ’ve been both. I ’m 
sorry. I wish you had the new clothes instead of 
me. I don’t deserve them anyhow.” 

“ Oh Rob dear, my dress is good and pretty, only 
I ’ve worn it for nice all winter, and I suppose it 
doesn’t look real party-like. I ’m glad you came 
along just then, for it made the girls stop teasing 


 


“ Lottie Thorne is a hateful little thing] I guess 
I wouldn’t be so ready to show her sums and all ! ” 
Rob returned, decisively. 

“ That ’s giants, Rob.” 

“ Well, there’s no use in my trying to be good.” 

“ Yes, it is best for us all to try. If we don’t suc- 
ceed, there is a good endeavor which shows that we 
thought about it.” 

“ Dreadfully discouraging, though.” 

Katliie glanced up with her bright smile, yet some- 
thing like tears were still shining in her eyes. 

“ I believe you are the best little girl in the world, 
as Charlie Darrell says.” 

That was some comfort to Kathie. For the re- 
mainder of the afternoon Rob was quiet and helpful, 
and did not go out to play, but read stories to Freddy. 
When Kathie had gone to put him to bed after sup- 
per, Rob said, huskily, and in a rapid tone, as if he 
was afraid he shouldn’t get through in time. “ Moth- 
er, if I had given up my clothes could Kathie have 
had a new dress ? ” 

“ You needed the clothes, Rob, even if you were 
not going to the party.” 

“ But — I’m sorry about Kathie. The girls are all 
making such a row over their new dresses.” 


 


There was a silence of a moment, half an hour it 
seemed to Bob, then lie said, almost heart-broken, 
“ Don’t you care a bit, mother ? Didn’t you like 
to have pretty things when you were a little girl ? ” 

“ Can you keep a secret, Bob ? ” Aunt Buth asked. 

“ Oh yes. What is it ? ” and he was all animation.
