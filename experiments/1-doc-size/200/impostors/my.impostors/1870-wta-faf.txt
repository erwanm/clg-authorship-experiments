hand. The barge was painted white, and was a shining mark in the night
for the savages to fire at.

"O, mercy!" cried Ella.

"Did it hit you?" I asked, alarmed by her cry.

"No, no--but----"

"Don't make any noise, then."

"Run the barge ashore hyer, boy," said Kit Cruncher, quietly.

I obeyed instantly; but another shot followed the first one, though,
fortunately, neither of them did any harm.

"Let the gal go ashore," added Kit.

I understood his plan, and assisted Ella to land.

"Run up the bank into the woods, and get behind a tree," I said to her,
as a third shot came across the river.

But the Indians were firing blindly in the dark, and though the last
bullet hit the boat, we were still safe. Kit stepped on the shore, and
we dragged the boat out of the water. The hunter paused on the bank of
the river, and gazed across in the direction from which the shots came.

"There's three on 'em over thyer," said Kit. "The shots was too near
together to come out of one barrel. Haul the barge up the bank afore
they hev time to load up agin."

The barge was light, and we had no difficulty in taking it up the bank
into the woods. For the present we were safe; but it was certain that
there were three savages on the bank of the river, and between us and
the Castle. We had, luckily, escaped injury so far, and Kit was not the
man to lead us into any unnecessary peril. We were now on the tongue of
land between the Big and the Little Fish Rivers, and only a short
distance above their junction. At the point where we landed it was less
than a quarter of a mile from one river to the other.

"We can't go down Fish River to-night," said I, when we had pulled the
boat up the bank.

"Not without resk, boy," replied Kit.

"What shall we do?" asked the frightened Ella.

"Don't be skeered, little gal," interposed Kit, in a tone more tender
than he was in the habit of using. "You are as safe hyer as you'd be in
your marm's lap."

"Can't the savages come over here?" she inquired.

"'Pears like they can't; leastwise, not without swimming, and we kin
stop 'em faster'n they kin come over. Rifle-balls travels fast,"
answered Kit, sagely. "But I don't reckon they'll want to come over
hyer."

"Do you suppose they know there are soldiers at the clearing?" I asked.

"I don't reckon they do. They mought know it, and they mought not; but
from what you say, I cal'late they hain't had time to go down and see."

"Perhaps they intended to go there to-night," I suggested.

"It mought be."

"I think they were looking for something to eat first. I believe the
two Indians who came across the river on the log were to meet the other
two at the camp on the brook where I went. They knew they could get
plenty of fish there. After I shot one of the party at the camp, the
remaining one must have come across the other two. They will keep
between us and the Castle."

"Most like they've been lookin' for the gal all the evenin'," added
Kit.

"It seems to me, if they knew the soldiers were at the clearing, they
would not stay here."

"'Tain't much use to guess at these things. You mought as well shoot at
nothin' in the dark. We can't go down Fish River to-night; that's all
that's sartin."

"That is very true."

"And I cannot see my mother to-night, then," said Ella.

"I dunno, little gal; 'pears like you can't; but mebbe you kin see your
father," replied Kit. "And it mought be you kin see both. I dunno. We
must be keerful. Better not see 'em till to-morrer 'n not see 'em at
all."

"What do you mean by seeing her father tonight, Kit?" I inquired,
afraid that he was kindling vain hopes in the mind of the suffering
maiden.

"I'll tell you, boy. Ef, as you say, them soldiers is rampagin' over
the country 'tween the Fish and Crooked River, we mought find 'em afore
mornin'. We kin kerry this boat over to the Big Fish, and land on
t'other side on't."

"That's a capital plan, Kit, and our safest course," I replied.

We wasted no time in debating a question on which we were perfectly
agreed. We carried the light barge across the tongue of land, and
launched it in the Big Fish. Our party embarked, and I pulled up the
river. I realized that it would not be an easy matter to find the
soldiers, for they would not kindle any camp fire, which would betray
their presence to the savages.

I pulled vigorously, for half an hour, against the current; and we were
satisfied that the three Indians had not crossed the river, for we were
not again annoyed by them. As the barge approached the rapids, beyond
which we could not go by water, we heard a noise on the shore.

"Who goes there?" shouted a soldier.

"Friends," I replied.

"Advance, friends, and give the countersign."

We had no countersign, but I immediately ran the boat ashore, and we
landed.




CHAPTER XV.

IN WHICH PHIL AND HIS COMPANIONS START FOR THE CASTLE.


"Who are you?" demanded the soldier who had hailed the boat, probably
astonished to find himself answered in plain English.

"Friends," I replied.

"What is your name?"

"Phil Farringford."

"You are the boy that came on board the steamer this morning?"

"I am; have you seen any Indians to-day?"

"Not an Indian."

"You didn't go where they were," I added.

"We have been beating about the woods all day; but the Indians who
captured the girl have dodged us."

"Then you haven't recovered her yet?"

"No."

"I have; and here she is," I continued; helping Ella out of the boat,
and up the bank of the river.

By this time half a dozen soldiers had gathered on the shore, with
their blankets on their arms. When they understood that the young lady
had been recovered from the Indians, they gave an involuntary cheer.

"Where is my father?" asked Ella, anxiously.

"I suppose he is with Lieutenant Pope," replied Corporal Flint, who was
the spokesman of the party. "The headquarters are about a mile up the
river."

"I must go to him at once," added Ella, nervously.

"You shall, miss. The hunt's up now, and we needn't stay here any
longer," continued the corporal. "We are divided into three squads, and
posted on the river to keep the Indians from crossing."

"There hasn't been an Indian on this neck for six hours," I added; and
I proceeded to inform the corporal in what manner the Indians had made
their escape.

"They are cunning," said he. "They know the country better than we do."

"Whar's the cap'n?" demanded Kit, who had been engaged in hauling the
barge out of the water, and concealing it in the bushes.

"Who are you?" replied Corporal Flint, as the tall hunter loomed up
before him.

"I don't reckon it makes any matter who I am; but I want to see the
cap'n, and show him whar the redskins is."

"Lieutenant Pope commands the troops, and he will be very glad to know
where the redskins are."

"My father is with him; do let us make haste," said Ella, dragging me
by the hand in the direction of the next post of the soldiers.

"We will escort you, miss," added the corporal, ordering his squad to
march.
