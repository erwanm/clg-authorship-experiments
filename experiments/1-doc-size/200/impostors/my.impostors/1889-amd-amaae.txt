my labors, when an incident occurred that enabled 
me to do a good deed as well. Going down for the 
noon train, I saw a ragged tramp sitting on a step at 
the end of the freight-room. After the train had 
gone, he shambled along in a downcast way, watching 
me wistfully. He was not more than twenty, but a 
pitiable object ; still, I had seen so many poor, half- 
starved railroad lads, that my heart went out to him. 

" Well ? " I said in a tone of inquiry, as he halted 
within speaking distance. 

"Then, you don't know me, Thurston?"' and the 
pale face flushed, partly with shame I think. 

As I studied him doubtfully, he said with some 
hesitation, " Crawford. I was down at Great 
Mammoth Beach two summers ago." 

" Not Joe Crawford ! " 

The tears came into the poor lad's eyes. 

Twenty months ago I had parted from a nice, 
bright, rosy-cheeked lad, who had been but two years 



 

in service. Now he was pale, gaunt, sodden as to 
complexion, and his eyes showed traces of dissipation. 

" I've seen awful hard times this winter," he said ; 
" and I have a promise of a place in Jersey City the 
1st of May. I've been staying a week with Jim 
Turner at Field's Landing, and he passed me on, 
if the boys hadn't been good to me " and the poor 
fellow broke down. 

The old, old story. Jim Turner was good-hearted, 
and a first-class man when he was sober ; but once a 
month or so he would go on what he called a u tear." 
Likely he and Crawford had been drinking together. 

"When did you leave Jim?*' I asked. 

"Last Friday. I've tramped since then, and 
begged. I heard some one say you were here. 
Thurston, I haven't had a crust since noon yester 
day, and I crawled under a shed last night. I can't 
see why some boys should have such bad luck." 

" First, then, you want a good square meal," I 
said. " Come into the station. I am living here." 

" Oh ! you're married." 

" No : my sister is with me," was my brief reply ; 
and I was rather glad Eve was up at the house. 

He followed me in. There was a little fire in the 
stove, and he went close to it with a sigh of relief. 
How wan and wretched he looked, a travesty upon 
youth, and the health he used to have ! 



 

" Sit down, and rest yourself," I said, " and I will 
hunt you up something." 

I was to take some lunch to Eve, who was busy 
with closets, painting the shelves and floors, and did 
.not want the walk just then. I prepared a bountiful 
plateful for Crawford, cold beef, biscuits, and a 
great slice of cake, and then put up ours. 

" Now," I said cheerfully to him, " you eat this ; 
then take this cushion, and curl up in the corner, 
and go to sleep. I'll be back in about an hour and 
a half," for I did not want to alarm Eve by any pro 
longed stay. "Make yourself at home. You're 
used to a railroad station." 

" You're such a good fellow ! " he said grate- 
fully. 

I locked the door of my office as usual, but the 
waiting-room was always kept open. 

Eve and I had our lunch, and then went on with 
our work. Hers was finished presently, but I had to 
leave mine with the same hopeless aspect. I should 
not get over to the berries before midsummer. 
Against Farmer Montgomery's advice, I had spaded 
up some ground, and planted pease. 

Going down, I told Eve of my tramp, and what I 
knew of him. I had met him first at the beach. 
He was a country lad, an orphan, and had learned 
telegraphing. When his married sister went West, 


he floated out to the great city, to add one more to 
the waifs and strays. 

" Poor fellow ! " said Eve pitifully. 

" If they would not spend their money for drink ! " 
I returned, rather impatiently. 

" Yet you have said, Adam, that you could hardly 
blame them, either, when their lives were so hard." 

I sighed. There was and is a great wrong some 
where, when destruction is set in the way of thou 
sands. Arid I remembered the first time I had seen 
Joe Crawford drunk : some of the boys had done it 
as a joke. He was very sick for a day or two, and 
very much ashamed ; and I had taken him in hand. 

He was asleep now, curled up in the corner-seat, 
with the cushion back of his head. He looked pallid 
in the extreme, and his lips were a kind of purplish 
blue. Deep shades of the same tint were under his 
eyes. His rusty felt hat was pulled down over his 
forehead ; but his nose was fine, and his chin had a 
certain character and determination, as if he might 
overcome evil if he once resolved earnestly. I re 
membered my own turning-point. 

Eve was busy about housewifely matters up-stairs. 
She was employing her time in the manufacture of 
marvellous lambrequins and curtains and chair- 
covers. Trains came and went. I wrote a little 
and at six Joe was still sleeping. 



 

" We shall have to keep him all night," said Eve ; 
and then she glanced in dismay at his rough and 
soiled attire. 

" Well, he can sleep anywhere : the trouble with 
such lads is often where to find a place to sleep." 

Joe started then, roused himself, and flushed 
redly. 

" I've had such a splendid nap ! " he began. 
" Why, it's never that late ! " glancing at the clock. 
" Well, I suppose I must tramp along," regretfully. 
"I'm obliged to you, Thurston, for this good rest 
and my dinner." 

"Were you going anywhere in particular?" 

" Well, no ; " and his face was scarlet. " I must 
tramp out a couple of weeks somehow." 

" Then, I think you had better remain here all 
night," I said quietly. " We can make you a bed." 

" I ain't fit to stay with with decent people," he 
blurted out on a half cry. 

"You can make yourself a little better. You 
would feel ever so much improved by a nice wash, 
and I can hunt up a clean garment or two." 

Joe Crawford did not speak, but winked his eyes 
hard ; yet, in spite of that, some tears rolled down 
his cheeks. 

"Come," I began cheerfully, "we'll fix you up 
so that you will hardly know yourself. I have a 



 

nice little corner up-stairs, and I'll get some warm 
water." 

I had manufactured a screen out of an old-fashioned 
clothes-horse, that shut my room off from the stair 
way. I consulted Eve, and she found an old suit of 
underwear and a shirt laid by for charitable uses. I 
filled a pail nearly full of warm water, brought towels 
and soap, and spread down an old mat. Then we 
retired to the office, and left him free from any 
danger of interruption. 

" I wish you had some clothes that would fit him. 
See here," said Eve eagerly. " He is just about Mr. 
Corwin's size ; and Mrs. Corwin was complaining a
