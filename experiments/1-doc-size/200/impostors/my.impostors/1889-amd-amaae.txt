a little water on the coffee. 

" Will you tell me whom you have been drinking 
with?" I asked. 

"No one. At least, this is the solemn truth, 
Thurston. While I was in Pryor's, he had a bottle 
of lager, and I took a glass. It stirred up all the 
devil of longing in me. I started to come home, 
then I went down the street to a saloon ; but I said 
I wouldn't go in, and I went past it, and on down 
to the boat-house. There is a little place below 
there " 

" Yes." A low den it was too. There had been 
strenuous objections to having the man's license 
renewed, but somehow it had worked through. 

" I went in, and had a drink of whiskey, and then 



 

my brain was all on fire. And I took another drink. 
I had only a quarter." 

" Where did you get it, Joe ? " I had been very 
careful not to give him any spending-money, and a 
horrible reflection on his honesty flashed through my 
mind. 

" Miss Thurston gave it to me. Oh, what a vile, 
thankless creature I have been ! I've carried that 
quarter since last Friday. Kick me out, Ad, dear 
old chap ! I'm not worthy of shelter and kindness." 

He began to cry again, and sprang up as if to go. 
I forced him back into his chair, and poured the 
coffee, which was black. 

" Here, drink it ! " I exclaimed. " Then lie down 
on my cot, and take a nap." 

" I will never touch another drop, I swear I will 
not, Thurston ! That is the last of the devilish stuff. 
Oh, what a good, good friend you are ! Do believe 
me, do ! " he entreated: 

"We will talk it over to-morrow. Now lie down." 
I led him to my bed, over which I had thrown a 
blanket, and went down-stairs. Eve did not arrive 
in that train ; but there were several of the business 
men I had come to know pretty well, and we chatted 
a bit. The next one was in at six-forty. I gave out 
some express parcels, looked over my accounts, and 
whiled away the time, half expecting a telegram, 



 

though none came. But she stepped out of the 
next train, and gave a careless nod to the polite 
conductor. 

"I am quite late," she began eagerly. "I hope 
you did not worry, and that you and Joe have had 
some supper. I have done such lots of things, and 
seen such crowds of people ! and, oh, it is so lovely 
to get back, even to a railroad station ! " 

We were in the waiting-room by this time. I had 
her satchel and parcel in one hand ; and the other 
arm I put around her, drawing her to me in a tender 
embrace, as I kissed her. She seemed so especially 
dear. 

" O Adam ! we might pass for lovers ! " with a 
curious little thrill in her voice. 

We went up-stairs, she talking rapidly; and then 
she threw her hat and mantle on the bed. I had set 
the dishes on the table, and the kettle was again 
boiling. 

" Where's Joe ? " she asked, as she lighted the lamp. 

" We had some coffee a while ago, and, as he was 
rather used up, I sent him to bed." 

"He is not ill?" 

" Oh, no ! rather tired out," I replied carelessly. 

I had resolved that I would not let Joe Crawford 
go ; and this secret, if kept between us two, might 
prove a bond. 



 

" I have had two dinners, or luncheons, or whatever 
they may be," she said gayly, " and a treat of cream, 
and some bananas; but I brought the last home 
to you and Joe. And now you must have some 
supper." 

I went out, and found Joe sleeping heavily as I 
expected. 

Eve poured my tea, and sliced the cold meat, 
dished out some jelly, and then leaned back in her 
chair. 

" You will laugh when I tell you all," and her face 
was radiant with mischief. " I have nearly furnished 
my house, and I have boarders and boarders ! " 

" O Eve ! " I exclaimed reproachfully. 

" I will begin at the very first. I went in to see 
Mrs. Harwood ; and she grows sweeter and sweeter, 
with just spice enou'gh to keep her from spoiling. 
She proposes to come over the first two weeks in 
June, and stipulated that she should be received as a 
boarder. She wants to go out driving every day, 
and it will be your business to hunt up the quadru 
ped and the vehicle. Then I went to the Browers's, 
for she told me they were going away. O Ad ! some 
people do have a lovely side to their misfortunes, after 
all. You know Mr. Brower failed in February ; and 
of course he gave up every thing, but that only paid 
thirty per cent. And now, through some friend, he 



 

has a situation to go out to a great fruit-importing 
house, at Zante I think it is, and he will take the 
family. Living is very cheap, and he has a good 
salary. Mrs. Brower is just wild with delight. Of 
course, she is charming any way ; but I couldn't help 
thinking that they never really suffered in any 
misfortune. They are selling off their furniture at 
private sale : that was hers, and the really valuable 
has all gone at a fairly good price. Next week they 
break up. Mrs. West will go to Tennessee to her 
other daughter's to live. That lady is coming on 
just after Fourth of July, when they will go to 
Saratoga, and up to Canada. Meanwhile Mrs. West 
must board somewhere, and she is very fond of the 
country. I don't know just who proposed this ; but 
I am going to have some household goods, and Mrs. 
West will take it out in board. She is the dearest, 
sweetest old lady, and will make very little trouble." 

" Upon my word," I said laughingly, " it is a 
clear case of barter! Eve, you are setting the 
improvements of political economy at defiance. It 
is only in the early stages of civilization that people 
trade in this manner." 

"I always get tangled up on political economy, 
but I can make bargains. She pays eight dollars a 
week, a pretty good price, I think ; and there will 
be eight weeks, sixty-four dollars. For that I get 



 

a really pretty cottage suite, springs and mattress, 
lots of odds and ends of carpets that will make over 
into rugs, and some beautiful glass and china, odd 
pieces that are not salable. In fact, I think I shall 
have a good deal for my trouble and small ex 
pense." 

" But and you are to teach music and painting, 
and keep house, and every thing ! You will wear 
yourself out." 

"I shall have a handmaiden. I had partly bar 
gained for her. Then, in July, six girls are coming 
over for a week. I am so afraid I shall get lonesome 
in the country," and she made an amusing face. 
"What makes you look so grave? does the prospect 
frighten you ? " 

I smiled then. "It is not the girls," I said, "but 
the one girl dearest to me. You seem to be doing 
every thing ; and I cannot make a dollar more, try 
my very best." 

" But you save it, you see," with her bright look, 
which certainly is inspiriting. " Do you not remem 
ber several of the neighbors said it would cost at
