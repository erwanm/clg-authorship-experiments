The girl met her eyes a minute, then 
quite surrendered. What was there else 
about it? 

Why, don't you know? Mrs. Jordan was 
almost compassionate. 

Her interlocutress had, in the cage, 
sounded depths, but there was a suggestion 
here somehow of an abyss quite measureless. 
Of course I know that she would never let 
him alone. 

How could she fancy ! when he had so 
compromised her? 

The most artless cry they had ever uttered 





broke, at this, from the younger pair of lips. 
Had he so ? 

Why, don't you know the scandal? 

Our heroine thought, recollected; there 
was something, whatever it was, that she 
knew, after all, much more of than Mrs. 
Jordan. She saw him again as she had seen 
him come that morning to recover the tele 
gram she saw him as she had seen him leave 
the shop. She perched herself a moment 
on this. Oh, there was nothing public. 

Not exactly public no. But there was 
an awful scare and an awful row. It was all 
on the very point of coming out. Some 
thing was lost something was found. 

Ah, yes, the girl replied, smiling as if 
with the revival of a blurred memory; 
something was found. 

It all got about and there was a point 
at which Lord Bradeen had to act. 

Had to yes. But he didn' t. 

Mrs. Jordan was obliged to admit it. 
No, he didn' t. And then, luckily for them, 
he died. 





I didn' t know about his death, her com 
panion said. 

It was nine weeks ago, and most sudden. 
It has given them a prompt chance. 

To get married this was a wonder 
within nine weeks? 

Oh, not immediately, but in all the cir 
cumstances very quietly and, I assure you, 
very soon. Every preparation 's made. 
Above all, she holds him. 

Oh yes, she holds him! our young friend 
threw off. She had this before her again a 
minute; then she continued: You mean 
through his having made her talked about? 

Yes, but not only that. She has still 
another pull. 

Another? 

Mrs. Jordan hesitated. Why, he was 
in something. 

Her comrade wondered. In what? 

I don't know. Something bad. As I 
tell you, something was found. 

The girl stared. Well 5 

It would have been very bad for him. 





But she helped him some way she recov 
ered it, got hold of it. It 's even said she 
stole it! 

Our young woman considered afresh. 
Why, it was what was found that precisely 
saved him. 

Mrs. Jordan, however, was positive. I 
beg your pardon. I happen to know. 

Her disciple faltered but an instant. Do 
you mean through Mr. Drake? Do they 
tell him these things? 

A good servant, said Mrs. Jordan, now 
thoroughly superior and proportionately 
sententious, doesn' t need to be told! Her 
ladyship saved as a woman so often saves ! 
the man she loves. 

This time our heroine took longer to 
recover herself, but she found a voice at 
last. Ah, well of course I don't know! 
The great thing was that he got off. They 
seem, then, in a manner, she added, to 
have done a great deal for each other. 

Well, it 's she that has done most. She 
has him tight. 





I see, I see. Good-bye. The women 
had already embraced, and this was not 
repeated ; but Mrs. Jordan went down with 
her guest to the door of the house. Here 
again the younger lingered, reverting, 
though three or four other remarks had 
on the way passed between them, to Captain 
Everard and Lady Bradeen. Did you 
mean just now that if she hadn't saved him, 
as you call it, she wouldn't hold him so 
tight? 

Well, I daresay. Mrs. Jordan, on the 
doorstep, smiled with a reflection that had 
come to her ; she took one of her big bites 
of the brown gloom. Men always dislike 
one when they have done one an injury. 

But what injury had he done her? 

The one I've mentioned. He must marry 
her, you know. 

And didn' t he want to? 

Not before. 

Not before she recovered the telegram? 

Mrs. Jordan was pulled up a little. Was 
it a telegram? 





The girl hesitated. I thought you said 
so. I mean whatever it was. 

Yes, whatever it was, I don't think she 
saw that. 

So she just nailed him? 

She just nailed him. The departing 
friend was now at the bottom of the little 
flight of steps; the other was at the top, 
with a certain thickness of fog. And when 
am I to think of you in your little home? 
next month? asked the voice from the 
top. 

At the very latest. And when am I to 
think of you in yours? 

Oh, even sooner. I feel, after so much 
talk with you about it, as if I were already 
there! Then Goodbye ! came out of 
the fog. 

Good I went into it. Our young lady 
went into it also, in the opposed quarter, 
and presently, after a few sightless turns, 
came out on the Paddington canal. Distin 
guishing vaguely what the low parapet 
enclosed, she stopped close to it and stood
