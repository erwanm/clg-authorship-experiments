I occupy a seat in church which is an admira 
ble one for reflection, but I cannot see or hear 
much that is going on in what we like to call the 
apse. There is a splendid stone pillar, a clus 
tered column, right in front of me, and I am as 
much protected from the minister as Old Put's 
troops were from the British, behind the stone 
wall at Bunker's Hill. I can hear his voice occa 
sionally wandering round in the arches overhead, 
and I recognize the tone, because he is a friend 
of mine. and an excellent man, but what he is say 
ing I can very seldom make out. If there was any 
incense burning I could smell it, and that would 
be something. I rather like the smell of incense, 
and it has its holy associations. But there is 
no smell in our church, except of bad air, for 
there is no provision for ventilation in the splen 
did and costly edifice. The reproduction of the 
old Gothic is so complete that the builders even 
seem to have brought over the ancient air from 



 

one of the churches of the Middle Ages, you 
would declare it hadn't been changed in two 
centuries. 

I am expected to fix my attention during the 
service upon one man, who stands in the centre 
of the apse and has a sounding-board behind 
him in order to throw his voice out of the sacred 
semicircular space (where the altar used to stand, 
but now the sounding-board takes the place of 
the altar) and scatter it over the congregation at 
large, and send it echoing up in the groined roof. 
I always like to hear a minister who is unfamiliar 
with the house, and who has a loud voice, try to 
fill the edifice. The more he roars and gives 
himself with vehemence to the effort, the more 
the building roars in indistinguishable noise and 
hubbub. By the time he has said (to suppose a 
case), " The Lord is in his holy temple," and has 
. passed on to say, " let all the earth keep silence," 
the building is repeating " The Lord is in his 
holy temple " from half a dozen different angles 
and altitudes, rolling it and growling it, and is 
not keeping silence at all. A man who under 
stands it waits until the house has had its say, 



I/O  



and has digested one passage, before he launches 
another into the vast, echoing spaces. I am 
expected, as I said, to fix my eye and mind on 
the minister, the central point of the service. 
But the pillar hides him. Now if there were sev 
eral ministers in the church, dressed in such gor 
geous colors that I could see them at the distance 
from the apse in which my limited income com 
pels me to sit, and candles were burning, and 
censers were swinging, and the platform was 
full of the sacred bustle of a gorgeous ritual 
worship, and a bell rang to tell me the holy 
moments, I should not mind the pillar at all. I 
should sit there, like any other Goth, and enjoy 
it. But, as I have said, the pastor is a friend of 
mine, and I like to look at him on Sunday, and 
hear wliat he says, for he always says something 
worth hearing. I am on such terms with him, 
indeed we all are, that it would be pleasant to 
have the service of a little more social nature, 
and more human. When we put him away off 
in the apse, and set him up for a Goth, and 
then seat ourselves at a distance, scattered about 
among the pillars, the whole thing seems to me 



 



I/I 



a trifle unnatural. Though I do not mean to 
say that the congregations do not "enjoy their 
religion" in their splendid edifices which cost so 
much money and are really so beautiful. 

A good many people have the idea, so it 
seems, that Gothic architecture and Christianity 
are essentially one and the same thing. Just as 
many regard it as an act of piety to work an 
altar cloth or to cushion a pulpit. It may be, 
and it may not be. 

Our Gothic church is likely to prove to us a 
valuable religious experience, bringing out many 
of the Christian virtues. It may have had its 
origin in pride, but it is all being overruled for 
our good. Of course I needn't explain that it is 
the thirteenth century ecclesiastic Gothic that is 
epidemic in this country ; and I think it has 
attacked the Congregational and the other non- 
ritual churches more violently than any others. 
We have had it here in its most beautiful and 
dangerous forms. I believe we are pretty much 
all of us supplied with a Gothic church now. 
Such has been the enthusiasm in this devout 
direction, that I should not be surprised to see 



 

our rich private citizens putting up Gothic 
churches for their individual amusement and 
sanctification. As the day will probably come 
when every man in Hartford will live in his own 
mammoth, five-story granite insurance building, 
it may not be unreasonable to expect that every 
man will sport his own Gothic church. It is 
beginning to be discovered that the Gothic sort 
of church edifice is fatal to the Congregational 
style of worship that has been prevalent here in 
New England ; but it will do nicely (as they say 
in Boston) for private devotion. 

There isn't a finer or purer church than ours 
anywhere, inside and outside Gothic to the last. 
The elevation of the nave gives it even that 
" high - shouldered " appearance which seemed 
more than anything else to impress Mr. Haw 
thorne in the cathedral at Amiens. I fancy that 
for genuine high-shoulderness we are not exceed 
ed by any church in the city. / Our chapel in the 
"rear is as Gothic as the rest of it, a beautiful 
little edifice. The committee forgot to make any 
more provision for ventilating that, than the 
church, and it takes a pretty well-seasoned Chris- 



 

tian to stay in it long at a time. The Sunday 
school is held there, and it is thought to be best 

to accustom the children to bad air before they 

go into the church. The poor little dears should 

n't have the wickedness and impurity of this 
world break on them too suddenly. J If the stran 
ger noticed any lack about our church, it would 
be that of a spire. There is a place for one ; 
indeed, it was begun, and then the builders seem 
to have stopped, with the notion that it would 
grow itself from such a good root. It is a mis 
take, however, to suppose that we do not know 
that the church has what the profane here call 
a " stump-tail " appearance. But the profane are 
as ignorant of history as they are of true Gothic. 
All the Old World cathedrals were the work of 
centuries. That at Milan is scarcely finished 
yet ; the unfinished spires of the Cologne cathe 
dral are one of the best-known features of it. I 
doubt if it would be in the Gothic spirit to finish 
a church at once. We can tell cavillers that we 
shall have a spire at the proper time, and not 
a minute before. It may depend a little upon 
what the Baptists do, who are to build near us. 



 

I, for one, think we had better wait and see how 
high the Baptist spire is before we run ours up. 
The church is everything that could be desired 
inside. There is the nave, with its lofty and 
beautiful arched ceiling ; there are the side aisles, 
and two elegant rows of stone pillars, stained so 
as to be a perfect imitation of stucco ; there is 
the apse, with its stained glass and exquisite 
lines ; and there is an organ-loft over the front 
entrance, with a rose window. Nothing was 
wanting, so far as we could see, except that we 
should adapt ourselves to the circumstances ; and 
that we have been trying to do ever since. It 
may be well to relate how we do it, for the bene 
fit of other inchoate Goths.
