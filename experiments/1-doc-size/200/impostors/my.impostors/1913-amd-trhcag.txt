Mrs. Mann was coming down the stairs, and 
greeted Mrs. Keen cordially. “ Are you pretty 
well ? ” she asked. 


“No, I jest ain’t. I’ve had colds and rheumatiz 
all winter. And Pine’s old wagon hain’t any 
springs to speak of an’ jounces turrible. I feel as 
if my hips and my spine was unjinted. But beg- 
gars can’t be choosers. He stopped to see Joe and 
mentioned that he was cornin’ over to Ridgewood, 
so I jest begged a chance. I wanted to see with 
my own eyes if ’twas true what they said. Bessy 
Firth, you’ve struck ile this time, if ther’s enough 
to last. You can’t alwers tell ’bout a man. Some 
are awful brags. An’ sometimes another wife 
comes to hand and there’s a big row. Don’t you 
feel afraid? ” 

She dropped her shawl and was taking off her 
coat, and now sank breathless into a chair. 

Bessy flushed and said with dignity, “ He is a 
well-known business man in New York, and has 
lived there all his life.” 

“ And you didn’t have to put the twins in some 
of them charity homes! I guess some of the 
women were awful riled to think it wasn’t their 
chance. Queer now, wasn’t it? Is he reel good 
to the children?” 

“ He is an excellent husband and father,” was 
the dignified reply. 

“ Well, I ain’t one to be eat up with envy over 
other folks’s good fortune. But the way of Provi- 




dence is mysterious, and when onlikely things hap- 
pen you can’t find ’em out. One of them Terry 
gals was in, an’ she said Cap was livin’ here an’ 
thought she was in clover. An’ she said that there 
was a sort of overseer, besides. It does beat all ! ” 
“ Yes, we like Cap very much.” 

Old man Terry used to growl ’bout havin’ so 
many gals, an’ now he’s kinder mad that they’re 
goin’ off. The one at the creamery is goin’ to be 
married an’ savin’ up her money for herself. An’ 
Cap’s got a beau. Then there’s some of the Denby 
women with money that never seem to catch one. 
An’ here you are young an’ well an’ have servants 
to wait on you, an’ I’m a poor old lady all alone, 
as you may say, for Joe’s wife wouldn’t do a 
hand’s turn unless I was sick in bed. I haven’t 
struck that queer place where your bones never 
return, though I’ve been mighty near it.” 

‘‘ I wonder if you wouldn’t like to look about 
the house ? ” asked Bessy. She was not so in- 
hospitable, but she thought it best to satisfy the 
old lady’s curiosity before Mr. Pine’s return. 

“ I jest would,” returned the guest delightedly. 

I slipped on an extry pair of stockings, but I 
won’t take ’em off, seeing as old Pine is cornin’ 
back this way, an’ if I don’t go with him the Lord 
only knows how I’ll get back.” 




Mrs. Mann rose. This is our library and gen- 
eral sitting-room, and this is the children’s play- 
room to keep their books and toys.” 

‘‘Massy me! Well, if you ain’t fixed! An’ 
what’s all this ? ” 

“ The dining-room, and here’s the kitchen and 
laundry.” 

Cap greeted her from the washtub. 

“Was it all fixed this way before? Did his 
other wife live here? ” 

“ No, it was the Gedney place. It was mort- 
gaged to him, and he had to take it. That was 
some time ago.” 

“Then he had to look up a wife!” The old 
lady gave a cackle. 

Bessy smiled a little. “ He was very fond of 
the children,” she said. 

“Well, if there ain’t everything here! Do you 
reely use that sparkly glass and them queer dishes ? 
Don’t you feel afraid of their getting broke? 
What a lot of handsome things ! ” 

It was Denby fashion to take a visitor all 
through the house if there was anything new in it, 
so now they walked upstairs. Rilla came out and 
greeted her. 

“ I shouldn’t think you’d hardly know yourself, 
Rilla ! Las’ time I see you, you was flyin’ round 




like a bee in a bottle makin’ jam. Grape time. 
Don’t you take any hand in housekeepin’ ? ” 

Rilla is going to school again. She has had to 
stay at home so much the last year.” 

The old lady was full of astonishment as she 
went through the rooms. 

Well, this is a change for you. Ain’t you 
afraid the children’ll get vain and haughty and 
won’t think they ought to work? Rich people’s 
children so often go to the bad, and there’s so many 
of yourn ’tain’t in reason that they’ll all turn out 
well. There’s many temptations before you can 
go through the eye of a needle. An’ your room’s 
fine enough for the President’s wife. Jest to think 
of that little old red house! ” 

Then they went downstairs. 

Perhaps you’d like a cup of tea after your 
jaunting about,” remarked Mrs. Mann. 

Well, I jest would. ’Tain’t summer, though it 
feels so here with them queer renovator things that 
look something like a Chinese temple.” 

Rilla made some tea and brought in biscuits and 
cold chicken. 

“ My I but this is good tea ! I can’t afford to 
make a good cup of tea but once a day, an’ then 
I heat it over. But you was poor yourself, an’ I 
dare say you had to scrimp, so you know how ’tis.” 




Granny Keen was hungry, but she spiced her 
meal with queer comments. 

“ I ain’t had such a feast in a dog’s age. They 
did ask me in to a Christmas dinner, but their old 
hen was tough and Joe’s wife’s a mighty poor 
cook; an’ Joe says the short’nin’ in the pie-crust 
gets in lengthways. Takes plenty of good things 
to make first-class cookin’, but when you ain’t got, 
you can’t use. You don’t let all the children come 
in to this fine table, do you? ” 

Oh, yes. Mr. Mann wants them all here.” 

But don’t you think you ought to have left 
that oldest boy in Beers’s store ? There’s so many 
of them, an’ stepfathers get tired of it, after a 
while.” 

“ Mr. Mann wanted him to go to school.” 

“ Well, well, I don’t see how all this happened to 
you.” 

There was a stir out-of-doors, and Prim rushed 
in. 

Mr. Pine’s come,” she announced. 

“ Pm sure it ain’t been an hour ! And I ain’t 
seen the garden. An’ I jest want to talk to Cap a 
minnit.” 

They went through the kitchen, and Mr. Pine 
was taking a survey of the grounds. 

Well, I swow!” he ejaculated. ‘‘Folks said 




'twas a miracle, your goin’ from that little old 
house an’ cornin’ here. Shouldn’t think you’d
