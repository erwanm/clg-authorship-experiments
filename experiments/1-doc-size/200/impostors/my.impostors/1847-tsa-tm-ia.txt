wears upon her brow a sunny smile. All who 
look upon her as she really is, must love her." 

" Truly said, for she is the very embodiment of 
beauty. But, how few there are who see her and 
know her." 

''Too few indeed." 

''Still, Anna, we are dealing but in generals. 
How are we to educate our child upon religious 
principles ?" 

" First of all, we should, as I have already endea- 
voured to do, impress upon her mind the idea of a 
God, and that he loves her, watches over her, and 
protects her from harm. This is easily done. No 
idea is so readily conveyed to a child's mind as 
that of the existence of God as a good Being. — 
When I talk to Marien, young as she is, about 
God and the angels who live in Heaven, she will 
look me steadily in the eyes, and listen with the 
most fixed attention. She cannot yet speak her 
thoughts, but I know that she more than half Com- 
prehends me, and that in the tender and most im- 
pressible substances of her mind, I am fixing ideas 
that can never be eradicated. As she grows older, 
and her mind expands, I shall not only teach her 
to regard the good of others, but instruct her in 



 

the right means of promoting it. The whole Law 
and the Prophets hang upon the precept: 'Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
thy neighbour as thyself.' Here is the starling 
point in all religion. With this fundamental doc- 
trine, must all olher doctrines square. To love 
God, is to live according to his commandments; 
and to love our neighbour is to seek his good — his 
highest good. If we live only for ourselves, and 
regard only ourselves, we live a false and irreligious 
life, and cannot be happy. No matter what doc- 
trines we profess — no matter by what name we call 
ourselves — if we do not seek the good of others we 
are irreligious." 

"With what truth may it be said — 'There is 
none good — no, not one,' " remarked Hartley, as his 
wife ceased speaking. " How easy it is to see the 
truth of a precept, and declare it ; but how hard a 
thing is it to live according to the tenor of that 
precept." 

" Yes — and how easy it is to talk about the 
education of our child, but how almost impossible 
will it be for us to accomplish the important task," 
replied Anna. " Already do J find myself at a loss 
how to meet and correct certain evil tendencies 
thus early apparent in our dear little one. These 
will grow stronger as she grows older. I cannot 



 

remove them — all I can do will be to prevent their 
attaining suificient strength to rule in her minil, at 
the same time that I seek to sow the seeds of op- 
posite good principles, that when she attains the 
age of rational accountability, and the great strug- 
gle commences, that takes place with every one, 
she may have the means of a sure conquest. If 
we could remove the evil tendencies with which 
our children are born, our duties would be lighter, 
for we could then work with more confidence. 
But this we cannot do. Each one has to do it for 
himself, when he comes to mature age — or rather, 
he has then to fight against the evils in himself, 
and when from right motives he does this, the 
Lord will remove them. All we can do for our 
child, is to keep, as far as it is in our power, her 
evils quiescent, and fill her mind with active prin- 
ciples of goodness. These will be weapons and 
proof armour in the strife that must take place, 
sooner or later. Fighting with these, she must 
come off conqueror." 




This was the first serious conversation that had 
taken place between Mr. and Mrs. Hartley on the 
subject of the education of their child. As their 
thoughts became more and more steadily directed to 
the subject, they saw their duty clearer and clearer. 
At least, such was the case with Mrs. Hartley, for 
her's was the task of making the first impression 
upon her child's mind — the first and most lasting 
impression. Upon the character of the mother de 
pends, almost entirely, the future character and' 
position of the child. No matter how wise and 
good the father may be, his influence will do but 
little if opposed to that of an injudicious mother. 
Take ten instances where men have risen from 
humble stations into eminence, and nine of these 
at least will be found the result of a mother's in- 
fluence. Her love is a different one; it is more 
concentrated— and the more we love an object, the 
more accurate becomes our perception of tlie means 
of benefitting that object. The father is, usually, 


all absorbed in the pursuit of a business or profes- 
sion by which to secure the temporal good of his 
family, and has little time, and too often less incli- 
nation to devote himself to his children. When 
he retires into his family, his mind seeks rest from 
the over excitements of the day, and he is unpre- 
pared to give to his children judicious instruction, 
or to administer wise correction. He cannot adopt 
a system, and regularly carry it out, because he is 
with them only for a short time each day, and can- 
not know their characters thoroughly, nor the 
means that best re-act upon and keep their evils 
quiescent. Upon the mother devolves, therefore, 
of necessity, the high and important duty of mould- 
ing the characters of her children — of impressing 
them for good or evil — of giving them true strength 
for their trials in after life. 

Sensibly did Mrs. Hartley feel this. The path 
of duty lay clearly defined before her, and she 
shrunk not from walking therein. Love for her 
child, and a high religious principle, were her 
prompters — that religious principle was a reverence 
for God, and a purified love of the neighbor. Tt 
was a religion that showed itself less in external 
acts of piety (though these were never omitted) 
than in an orderly and blameless life — an upright 
walk and a chaste conversation. Her charity con- 



 

sisted in the faithful performance of all known du- 
ties — the filling up of her measure of usefulness in
the sphere where Providence had placed her. 

Her first efforts with her child, as reason began to 
dawn, were the best a mother can use. She sought to 
impress upon the mind of her little Marien one idea. 
Among the first words she taught her to say, were, 
" Good Man in Heaven." And she always uttered 
these words with a quiet, thoughtful face, and point- 
ed upwards. Soon, the answer to " Who loves little 
Marien ?" would be " Papa." " Who else ?" " Mam- 
ma." " Who else ?" " Good Man in Heaven." 

At every step she endeavored to fix more deep- 
ly this impression. The lisped prayer on retiring 
to bed was never omitted. 

The next eflbrt she made was to counteract the 
selfish tendency of the child. She began with 
teaching her that she must love God — the second 
step was to cause her to regard the good of others- 

If her husband, from the very nature of his occu- 
pation, could not aid her much in the practical ap- 
plication of right means, he was ever ready to con- 
fer with her, and to aid her in discovering these 
means. They thought much, and conversed much 
together upon the subject. 

'' The hardest thing I have to do, is to cause 
Marien to obey me," said xMrs. Hartley, as they sat 



 

conversing about their child, one evening after she 
had been put to bed. 

" No doubt of it," replied her husband. " And 
yet obedience is, of all things, most necessary. In 
the young mind must be formed vessels into which 
principles of action that are to govern in manhood, 
can flow. Obedience to parents forms in tlie mind 
vessels that become recipients of obedience to civil 
laws, without which all social order would be de- 
stroyed ; — and, by an easy process, obedience to law 
changes as the mind rises into higher and better 
states, into obedience to divine laws. Obedience to 
these laws involves all the rest. A good Christian is 
of necessity a good citizen. He does not obey the
