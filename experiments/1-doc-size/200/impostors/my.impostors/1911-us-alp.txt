sistent and perplexing. The world was pressing them, 
jealous of their dream of delight. 

Their little fund of money was gone, and so Thyrsis 
went back to his hack-work. All day he sat by the 



 

window and slaved at it, while Corydon lay upon the 
bed and read, or wandered about the park by herself. 
Thyrsis' burden was twice as heavy now, for he had to 
earn for two; and when in the ecstasies of love she 
cried out to him that she was his forever, the cruel 
mockery of circumstance translated this to mean that 
he would forever have to earn for two ! 

He wrote more book-reviews, and peddled them about ; 
sometimes he was forced to exchange them for books 
he reviewed, and then to sell the books for twenty or 
thirty cents apiece. He wrote up some ideas for po- 
litical cartoons, and got three dollars for one of them. 
He wrote a parody upon a popular poem, and got six 
dollars for that. He met a college friend, just re- 
turned from a trip in the Andes, and he patiently col- 
lected the material for a narrative, and sold it to a 
minor magazine for fifteen dollars. 

And meanwhile he toiled furiously at another pot- 
boiler, a tale of Hessians and Tories and a red-cheeked 
and irresistible revolutionary heroine, to fill the insa- 
tiable maw of the readers of the "Treasure Chest." On 
one occasion, when everything went wrong, Corydon took 
the half-dozen solid silver coffee-spoons and the heavy 
gold-plated berry-spoon which had constituted her out- 
fit of wedding-presents, and sold them to a nearby 
jeweler for two dollars and a quarter. 

But through all this bitter struggle they looked for- 
ward to a glorious ending. In April the book would 
be out and then they would be free! They would go 
away to the country perhaps to the little cabin of 
last summer ! Ah, how they dreamed of that cabin, how 
they hungered for it ! They pictured it, covered in 
snow, with the ice-bound brook in front of it both 





the cabin and the brook asleep, and dreaming of the 
spring-time. 

Thyrsis was dreaming of it also, with tears in his 
eyes v and a mighty passion in his heart; for his new 
book was calling to him he had to fight hard to keep 
it from taking possession of his thoughts and driving 
the pot-boilers out of the temple. 

There came the joyful excitement of reading the 
proofs of his book ; also of inspecting the cover-de- 
sign, and the sample of the paper, and the "dummy". 
And then it was two weeks from now ! Then it was 
only ten days then only one week. And finally the 
raptures of the first sample copy ! 

It was time the publishers had begun to advertise it, 
and Thyrsis went to see Mr. Taylor about the matter. 
Mr. Taylor was vague in his replies. Then came publi- 
cation-day, and still no advertisements ; and Thyrsis 
called again, and insisted and expostulated, and learned 
to his consternation that they were not going to ad- 
vertise it ; the season was a bad one, the firm had met 
with unexpected expenses, and so on. When Thyrsis re- 
minded them of their promises, and threatened and 
stormed, Mr. Taylor informed him quietly that there 
was nothing in the contract about advertising. 

So Thyrsis went home, and tried to forget his rage 
in the work of disposing of his hundred copies. He 
had prepared himself for the possibility of everything 
else failing, but here he had a plan whereby he felt that 
his deliverance was assured. He had made up a list 
of a hundred of the best-known men of letters in the 
country college presidents and professors, editors and 
clergymen, novelists and poets and critics ; and he had 
done more hack-work, and earned the twenty dollars 
it would take to send to each of them a copy of the 



 

book, together with his manifesto, and a little type- 
written note. This, he felt, would make certain of the 
book's being read ; and once let the book be read by the 
real leaders of the country's thought, and his siege 
would be at an end! 

So the packages went to the post-office, freighted with 
the burden of his hopes and longings. And two or three 
times a week Thyrsis went to see his publishers, and 
find out how the book was going. He was never able to 
ascertain just what they were doing with it, or how 
they expected to sell it; Mr. Taylor would tell him 
vaguely that it was doing fairly well the season was 
"slow", and he must give the book time to "catch on". 

And then came the reviews. A clipping-bureau had 
written, offering to furnish them at five cents apiece ; 
and this was moderate, considering that there were only 
a dozen altogether. Most of these were from unim- 
portant out-of-town papers, whose book-reviews are 
written by the high-school nieces and the elderly maiden- 
aunts of the publishers. Of the metropolitan news- 
papers and literary organs, only three noticed the book 
at all; and two of these gave perfunctory mention, 
evidently made up from the publisher's statement on 
the cover. 

The third writer had connected the book with the 
interview in the "Morning Howl", and he wrote a bur- 
lesque review of it, in which he hailed it as the "Great 
American Novel". His method was to retell the story, 
quoting the most highly-wrought passages, with just 
enough comment to keep it in the vein of farce. To 
Thyrsis this mockery came like a blast of fire in the 
face; he did not know that it was the regular method 
of the newspaper a method by means of which it had 





made itself known as the cleverest and most readable 
paper in the country. 

3. ALL this was the harder for him, because it 
came at a black and spectral hour of his life. It was 
not enough that the book was falling flat, and that 
all their hopes were collapsing; a new and most terrible 
calamity befell them. For three months now they had 
been dissolved in the bliss of their young dream of 
love; and now suddenly had come a thunderbolt, split- 
ting the darkness about them, and revealing the grim 
hand of Fate closing down ! 

For several years of her life Corydon had carried a 
trying burden once each month she would have to lie 
down for three or four days and be a semi-invalid. And 
last month this had not happened; the time had come 
and gone, and she was as well as ever. She had told 
Thyrsis about it, and how it disturbed her; it might 
mean nothing, it had happened several times before to 
her; but then again it might mean that she had con- 
ceived. 

The idea had been too frightful to contemplate, 
however, and they had put it aside. It was not possible 
the doctor had told them how to prevent it; he had 
told them that "everybody" did it, and that they could 
feel safe. 

But now came the second month; and Corydon, filled 
with a vague terror, waited for the day. And horrible 
beyond all telling the day came and went once more! 
And two days came three days ! And so finally Cory- 
don went to see the doctor. 

When she came home again, and entered the room, 
Thyrsis saw it all in her face, without her uttering a 



 

word. He went sick, all at once; and Corydon sank 
down upon the bed. 

"Well?" he asked, in a hoarse voice. 

"It's true," she said. 

"And what did he say?" 

"He said he said I was in splendid shape, and that 
I would have a fine baby !" 

And Thyrsis stared at her, and then suddenly burst 
into wild laughter, and hid his head in his arms. Such 
was their mood that she could not feel sure whether 
he was laughing or crying. 

Now, indeed, they were facing the reality of life. All 
the problems with which they had ever wrestled were 
'as child's play to this problem; they could sit and read 
the deadly terror in each other's eyes. Corydon's lip 
was trembling, and her face was white and drawn and 
old. So swiftly had fled her young dream of joy!
