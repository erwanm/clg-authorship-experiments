not have been long afterward, Mrs. Faith came suddenly again across my
path.  She radiated happiness and health and beauty, and when she held
out both her hands to me in greeting they seemed to glitter, as if she
had stepped from a bath of delight.

"Oh," she said joyously, "have you seen Him yet?"  It embarrassed me
to be forced to answer in the negative; it gave me a strange feeling,
as if I had been a convict in the country, and denied the passport of
honourable men.  I therefore waived her question as well as I might,
and proceeded to make known to her the thought which had been occupying
me.

"You have the entr√©e of the dear earth," I said sadly.  "They do
not treat you in the--in the very singular manner with which I am
treated.  It is important beyond explanation that I get a message to my
wife.  A beggar in the street may be admitted to her charity,--I saw
one at the door the night I stood there.  I, only I, am forbidden to
enter.  Whatever may be the natural laws which are sot in opposition to
me, they have extraordinary force; I can do nothing against them.  I
suppose I do not understand them.  If I had an opportunity to study
them--but I have no opportunities at anything.  It is a new experience
to me to be so--so disregarded by the general scheme of things.  I seem
to be of no more consequence in this place than a bootblack was in the
world, or a paralytic person.  It seems useless for me to fly in the
face of fate, since this is fate.  I have no hope of being able to
reach my wife.  You have privileges in this condition which are
evidently far superior to mine.  I have been thinking that possibly you
may be able--and willing--to approach her for me?"

"I don't think it would succeed, Doctor," replied my old patient
quickly.  "I'd do it!  You know I would!  But if I were Helen--She is
a very reserved person; she never talks about her husband, as different
women do; her feeling is of such a sort; I do not think she would
understand, if another woman were to speak from you to her."

"Perhaps not," I sighed.

"I am afraid it would be the most hopeless experiment you could make,"
said Mrs. Faith.  "She loves you too much for it," she added, with the
divination of her sex.  Comforted a little by Mrs. Faith, I quickly
abandoned this project; indeed, I soon abandoned every other which
concerned itself with Helen, and yielded myself with a kind of
desperate lethargy, if I may be allowed the expression, to the fate
which separated me from her.  Of resignation I knew nothing.  Peace was
the coldest stranger in that strange land to me.  I yielded because I
could not help it, not because I would have willed it; and with that
dull strength which grows into the sinews of the soul from necessity,
sought to adjust myself in such fashion as I might to my new
conditions.  It occurred to me from time to time that it would have
been an advantage if I had felt more interest in the conditions
themselves; that it would even have spared me something if I had ever
cultivated any familiarity with the possibilities of such a state of
existence.  I could not remember that I had in the old life
satisfactorily proved that another could not follow it.  It seemed to
me that if I had only so much as exercised my imagination upon the
possible course of events in case another did, it would have been of
some practical service to me now.  I was in the position of a man who
is become the victim of a discovery whose rationality he has
contemptuously denied.  It was like being struck by a projectile while
one is engaged in disproving the existence of gunpowder.

If a soul may properly be said to be stunned, mine at this time, was
that soul.

In this condition solitude was still so natural to me that I made no
effort to approach the people of the place, and contented myself with
observing them and their affairs from a distance.  They seemed a very
happy people.  There could be no mistake about that.  I did not see a
clouded countenance; nor did I hear an accent of discomfort, or of
pain.  I wondered at their joyousness, which I found it as impossible
to share as the sick find it impossible to share what has been called
"the insolence of health."  It did, indeed, appear to me as something
almost impertinent, as possession always appears to denial.  But I had
never been denied before.  I perceived, also, that the inhabitants of
this country were a busy people.  They came and went, they met and
parted, with the eagerness of occupation; though there was a
conspicuous absence of the fretful haste to which I had been used in
the conduct of business.  I looked upon the avocations of this strange
land, and wondered at them.  I could not see with what they were
occupied, or why, or to what end.  They affected me perhaps something
as the concerns of the human race may affect the higher animals.  I
looked on with an unintelligent envy.

One day, as I was strolling miserably about, a child came up and spoke
to me.  He, like myself, was alone.  He was a beautiful child,--a
little boy; he seemed scarcely more than an infant.  He appeared to be
in search of some one or of something; his brilliant eyes roved
everywhere; he had a noble little head, and carried himself
courageously.  He gave no evidence of fear or sadness at his isolated
position but ran right on,--for he was running when I saw him,--as if
he had gone forth upon some happy, childish errand.

But at sight of me he paused; regarded me a moment with the piercing
candour of childhood, as if he took my moral measure after some
inexplicable personal scale of his own; then came directly and put his
hand into my own.

I grasped it heartily,--who could have helped it?--and lifting the
little fellow in my arms kissed him affectionately, as one does a
pretty stranger child.  This seemed to gratify him rather than to
satisfy him; he nestled in my neck, but moved restlessly, slipping to
the ground, and back again into my arms; jabbering incoherently and
pleasantly; seeming to be diverted rather than comforted; ready to
stay, but alert to go; in short, behaving like a baby on a visit.
After awhile the child adjusted himself to the situation; grew quiet,
and clung to me; and at last, putting both his arms about my neck, he
gave the long, sweet sigh of healthy infant weariness, and babbling
something to the general effect that Boy was tired, he dropped into a
sound and happy sleep.

Here, indeed, was a situation!  It drew from me the first smile which
had crossed my lips since I had died.  What, pray, was I, who seemed to
be of no consequence whatever in this amazing country, and who had more
than I knew how to do in looking after myself, under its mysterious
conditions,--what was I to do with the spirit-baby gone to sleep upon
my neck?

"I must go and find the Orphan Asylum," I 'thought; "doubtless they
have them in this extraordinary civilization.  I must take the little
fellow to some women as soon as possible."  At this juncture, my friend
Mrs. Faith appeared, making a mock of being out of breath, and laughing
heartily.

"He ran away from me," she merrily explained.  "I had the care of him,
and he ran on; he came straight to you.  I couldn't hold him.  What a
comfort he will be to you!...  Why, Doctor!  Do you mean to say you
don't know who the child is?"

"It seems to me," she added, with a mother's sublime superiority, "I
should know my own baby!  If I were so fortunate as to find one
here!--How much less you know," she proceeded naively, "than I used to
think you did!"

"Did the child die?" I asked, trembling so that I had to put the
little fellow down lest he should fall from my startled arms.  "Did
something really ail him that night when his mother--that miserable
night?"

"The child died," she answered gravely.  "Dear little Boy!  Take him up
again, Doctor.  Don't you see?  He is uneasy unless you hold him fast."

I took Boy up; I held him close; I kissed him, and I clung to him, and
melted into unintelligible cries above him, never minding Mrs. Faith,
for I quite forgot her.

But what I felt was for my child's poor mother, and all my thought was
for her, and my heart broke for her, that she should be so bereft.


"I should like to know if you suppose for one minute that she wouldn't
rather you would have the little fellow, if he is the least bit of
comfort to you in the world?"

Mrs. Faith said this; she spoke with a kind of lofty, feminine scorn.

"Why, Helen loves you!" she said, superbly.




CHAPTER XIII

"I believe," said my old patient, "I believe that was the highest
moment of your life."

A man of my sort seldom comprehends a woman of hers.  I did not
understand her, and I told her so, looking at her across the clinging
child.

"There was no self in it!" she answered eagerly.

"Oh," I said indifferently, "is that all?"

"It is everything," replied the wiser spirit, "in the place that we
have come to.  It is like a birth.  Such a moment has to go on living.
One is never the same after as one was before it.  Changes follow.  May
the Lord be in them!"

"But stay!" I cried, as she made a signal of farewell, "are you not
going to help me--is nobody going to help me take care of this child?"

She shook her head, smiling; then laughed outright at my perplexity;
and with a merry air of enjoyment in my extraordinary position, she
went her ways and left me.

There now began for me a singular life.  Changes followed, as Mrs.
Faith had said.  The pains and the privileges of isolation were
possible to me no longer.  Action of some sort, communion of some kind
with the world in which I lived, became one of the imperative
necessities about which men do not philosophize.  For there was the
boy!  Whatever my views about a spiritual state of existence, there
always was the boy.  No matter how I had demonstrated the
unreasonableness of living after death, the child was alive.  However I
might personally object to my own share of immortality, I was a living
father, with my motherless baby in my arms.

Up to this time I had lived in an indifferent fashion; in the old
world, we should have called it "anyhow."  Food I scarcely took, or if
at all, it was to snatch at such wild fruits as grew directly before
me, without regard to their fitness or palatableness; paying, in short,
