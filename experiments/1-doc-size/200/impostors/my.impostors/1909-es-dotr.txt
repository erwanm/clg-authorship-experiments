"Very good," he said. "We will go to the 
Orient since you wish it." 

With a feline twist of the tongue SalJy 
moistened her lips. She had the sensation 
of being lifted lightly in the air. It was the 
last fence. She had reached the post a winner. 

Alone in his room that night Welden still 
heard the leaves. They fell slowly, solemnly, burying the past beneath their slender 
weight, raising between him and it a veil, 
tenuous and aerial. Higher it rose, higher 
still, ever higher until, sinking again, it en 
veloped memory in it. 

A fortnight later Welden and Sally, at- 
tended by their servants, embarked from 
Southampton on a voyage that took them 
first to India, where they loitered, then to 
Hong Kong, where they were married and 
finally to White Peacocks. 

There the journey ended. There, for one 
of them, eternity began. 




"Well, William, how are you? Is Miss 
Barhyte at home?" 

"Yes, sir, Miss Barhyte has just come in. 
I hope I see you very well, sir. It's a long 
time, sir " 

Taking Welden's hat and stick, the servant showed him into the library, which apparently, was unaltered. The cushions on 
the sofa were as colourful as before. Oppo 
site, the piano stood, and from the walls powdered heads looked down. But, from the 
table, the Sicilians had gone. In place of 
Greek poetry there was now a book of 





French verse. Otherwise the room was quite 
as it had been the year previous and, apart 
from a black band on the sleeve of his grey 
coat, Welden himself was unchanged. There 
was the same smile in his eyes, the same glint 
in his hair, the same appearance of suppleness and strength. 

He had opened the book and was loitering 
in its languors when William reappeared. 

"I am sorry, sir. I made a mistake. Miss 
Barhyte is not at home." 

The mistake must have been anticipated. 
Welden manifested no surprise. 

"Is the general in?" he asked, his eyes still 
on the book. 

"No, sir. The general is not at home 
either." 

But now Welden put the book aside and 
nodded. 

"Give him my compliments and say that 
I will wait on him at nine to-night. How is 
he?" 



 

"Pretty well, sir." The man moved out 
through the reception room to the marble 
of the hall, where he handed Welden his hat 
and stick. "That was a nasty accident he 
had last summer. He limps a little still. 
Yes, sir." 

Opening the door, he held it open until 
Welden reached the street. 

Welden sauntered on. Five days previous 
he had left Santa Barbara. It was but an 
hour or two before that he had reached New 
York. In his head he could still feel the motion of the cars. That would pass, he told 
himself, as all things do. It would pass, as 
would also pass a girl's disinclination to be 
at home. 

He sauntered on, turned into Fifth ave 
nue, and sauntered up. At once, a man whom 
he knew stopped him, buttonholed, ques 
tioned, platitudinised. From passing traps 
and motors, women bowed, two other men 
joined him and, at the curb, a withered creature tossed from a barrel-organ a strain of 
Italian love. 

The men annoyed him. It wearied him 
to talk about what had happened. It wearied him as much to be told about stocks. Pretexting a pretext he hailed a hansom and 
sailed away. 

Presently, at the Plaza, where he had put 
up, it was comforting to find that his luggage had arrived. After the philistinism of 
the West, it was agreeable to be lodged in 
an artistic inn. After the horrors of a transcontinental trip, it was a pleasure to dress 
at ease. After the convict fare of the Limited, food properly served was a relief. After a tragedy, a change of air is good for the 
nerves. 

Welden, as he sat at table that evening, 
his recent mourning indicated in his shirt by 
two small black studs, considered momen 
tarily these minor gifts of the minor gods. 
But he had work ahead of him and, at five 



 

minutes to nine, hailing a hansom, he sailed 
back to Madison avenue. 

At a door there, as he rang, a melody of 
Beethoven's which was being played within, 
ceased abruptly. The door opened and Wil 
liam, after taking his hat and coat, showed 
him into the dining-room where, before a 
wide table, the general sat, looking, as perhaps a general should, very fierce. 

"William," he ordered, "close the door be 
hind you." 

Then, rising, he turned at Welden. 

"Had you left your address this after 
noon, I would have warned you not to call 
here. Your conduct has been dastardly. 
Dastardly! God bless my soul, there is no 
other word for it." 

He paused, removed his glasses and shook 
them. 

"After an accident which I experienced 
and Maud had joined me at Frascati's, you 
picked a quarrel with Malakoff , induced the 




duchess to obtain a divorce and married the 
lady, married her, God bless my soul, when 
you were engaged to my daughter and to 
day, your wife barely cold in her grave, you 
have the impudence to come here. Damn 
me, sir, if I had acted as you have I would 
have come expecting the cowhide." 

As the tirade proceeded the general's voice 
mounted to the diapason of a roar. At its 
conclusion he stamped a foot. 

"Yes, damn me, the cowhide." 

Immediately, but without heat, Welden 
took it up. 

"From no other man living would I en 
dure for an instant that expression, nor yet 
the one which preceded it. But you are 
right, right, that is, from your point of view. 
It would be dastardly, and it would be the 
cowhide I should expect, if I had acted as 
you say I have, intentionally." 

"Intentionally," the general shouted. 
"Intentionally" 



 

He would have run on but Welden cut in. 

"When your daughter left Deauville I 
was on my way to Paris. She wrote me of 
your accident, telling me she was going to 
you at once, and asking me to join you both 
at Frascati's " 

"Damn me, sir, this is ancient history."
