first glance at her face assured me that I was no unwelcome visitor.

“Thank you, Doctor,” she said, as she extended her hand, “for this early
call. Our meeting last night for the first time can hardly be called a
pleasant one--or the associations connected with it such as either of us
might wish to recall.”

“Our control over events is so slight,” I made answer as I resumed my
seat, “that we should separate unpleasant feelings as far as possible
from any memories connected with them.”

A faint, sad smile just lightened up her placid face as she said, in
reply to the remark.

“Ah, Doctor, that may not be. Lives are too intimately blended here for
any one to suffer or do wrong without leaving a burden of sadness on
other memories.”

“True; but the burden will be light or heavy according to our strength.”

She looked at me without replying, for the remark was so palpable, that
it seemed to involve nothing beyond a literal fact.

“Or rather,” I said, “the burden will be heavy or light according to our
state or quality.”

There was a sign of awakening interest in her countenance as if my
remark had touched some hidden spring of thought.

“If we are right with ourselves,” I went on, “the disturbance produced
by others’ misconduct will not reach very far down. The pressure of
sadness may lie upon us for a season; but cannot long remain; for the
pure heart will lift itself into serene atmospheres.”

“But, who is right with himself?” she said. “Whose heart is pure enough
to dwell in these serene atmospheres? Not mine, alas!”

I looked into the suddenly illuminated face as she put these questions,
in surprise at the quick change which had passed over it. But the
tone in which she uttered the closing sentence was touched with tender
sadness.

“Rather let me say,” I made answer, “in the degree that we are right
with ourselves. None attain unto perfection here.”

“Yet,” said the lady, with a sweet calmness of manner that made her
look beautiful, “is it not pleasant to imagine a state of perfection--or
rather a state in which evil is quiescent, and the heart active with all
good and loving impulses? How full of inspiration is such an ideal of
life! But the way by which we must go, if we would rise into this state,
is one of difficulty and perpetual warfare. The enemies of our peace are
numbered by myriads; and they seek with deadly hatred to do us harm.”

“And yet are powerless,” said I, “if we keep the outworks of our lives
in order.”

“Yes,” she answered, “it is the very ultimate or last things of our
lives where the power of repulsion resides. We can, in temptation, be it
ever so strong, refuse to act in the wrong direction--refuse to do an
evil thing, because it is sinful. And this is our bulwark; this is our
tower of safety; for it is only in wrong doing that our enemies gain
the victory over us. They may assault us never so fiercely--may dazzle
our eyes with the glitter of this world’s most alluring things--may
stir the latent envy, malice, pride, or dishonesty, that lurks in every
heart; but if we stand still, hold back our hands and stay our feet--if
we give our resolute ‘No’ to all enticements, and keep our actions
free from evil, all hell cannot prevail against us. God will take care
of the interior of our lives, and make them pure and heavenly, if we
resist evil in the exterior. But, pardon me; I did not mean to read you
a homily.”

She smiled with a grave sort of smile, and then sat silent.

“I like your way of talking,” said I. There was something about the lady
that put me at ease with her, and I said this without reserve, as if
I were speaking to a friend. “It looks to higher things in life than
people usually regard as worthy of our chief consideration. To most of
us, the outer world offers the highest attractions; only the few turn
inwardly to the more beautiful world of mind.”

“Outward things fade--change--die; only spiritual things dwell in
unfading beauty. We are in a world of mere effects as to our bodies;
but the soul lives in the world of causes. Do we not spend a vain
and unprofitable life, then, if we go on building, day after day, our
tabernacle on the ever-shifting sands of time, instead of upon the
immovable Rock of Ages? But who is guiltless of this folly? Not I! not
I!”

Again that calm, earnest voice fell to a lower key, and was veiled by a
tender sadness.

“It is something gained,” she added, with returning firmness of tone,
“if, even after the sharp lessons of many years, we get glimpses of
Truth, and are willing to follow, though it be at a far distance, the
light she holds aloft. Yes, it is something gained--something gained!”

She spoke the last words as if merely thinking aloud, and not addressing
an auditor.

“Can I aid you in anything, madam?” said I, breaking in upon a state
of reverie into which her mind seemed to be falling. “The circumstances
under which you find yourself are peculiar--I refer to the death of Mrs.
Allen, following so quickly on your arrival among strangers--and you
may stand in need of friendly service from one who knows the people and
their ways. If so, do not hesitate to command me.”

“I thank you sincerely,” she answered, unbending still more from
her almost stately manner. “Friendly consideration I shall need, of
course--as who does not in this world? And I repeat my thanks, that
you have so kindly and so promptly anticipated my needs So far as the
remains of my unhappy kinswoman are concerned, I have referred all to
the undertaker. He will carry out my wishes. To-morrow the interment
will take place. On the day following, if it it is altogether agreeable
to yourself, I would esteem a call as a particular favor.”

I arose, as she concluded the last sentence, saying as I did so,

“I will be sure to call, madam; and render any service in my power. You
may regard me as a friend.”

“Already you have extorted my confidence,” she answered, faintly
smiling.

I bowed low, and was retiring when she said--

“A moment, Doctor!”

I turned toward her again.

“Doctor, it may be well for you to see my daughter.”

“Is she indisposed?” I asked.

“Not exactly that. But the excitement and alarm of the last two or three
days have been, I fear, rather too much for her nerves. I say alarm, for
the poor girl was really frightened at Mrs. Allen’s wild conduct--and no
wonder. Death following in so sad a way, shocked her painfully. She did
not sleep well last night; and this morning she looks pale and drooping.
In all probability, quiet of mind and body will soon adjust the balance
of health; still, it may be safest for you to see her.”

“A mere temporary disturbance, no doubt, which, as you suggest, quiet of
mind and body will, in all probability, overcome. Yet it will do no harm
for me to see her; and may save trouble.”

“Excuse me a moment,” she said, and left the room. In a little while she
returned, and asked me to accompany her up stairs.

I found the daughter in a black and gray silk wrapper, seated on a
lounge. She arose as I entered, a slight flush coming into her face,
which subsided in a few moments, leaving it quite pale, and weary
looking. After we were all seated, I took her hand, which was hot in the
palm, but cold at the extremities. Her pulse was feeble, disturbed, and
quick.

“How is your head?” I asked.

“It feels a little strangely,” she replied, moving it two or three
times, as if to get some well defined sensation.
