 

"Yes." returns Cynthia, making a mental note of this 
suggestion. 

They manage to sing a little song very well at the last, 
a street melody to be sure. Miss Milliard drives down in 
time to see the motley throng dismissed, and picks up 
Cynthia for a drive over autumn ways, much entertained 
by a report of the day's proceedings. 

" If there were some one who would come in and give the 
women a few lessons it would be a great advantage. The 
garments the children wear are fearful to behold! A 
woman was here this morning with a jacket for her boy, 
cut out of some old stuff, and it puzzled us both," declared 
Cynthia. 

" But we do not expect you to embark in that business," 
says Miss Hilliard. " Why couldn't that be the aim of the 
mothers' afternoon ? There ought to be some competent 
person found in the church capable of directing, and will- 
ing to undertake it. The talks on clothes might be as good 
as the talks on some other subjects. We cannot have so 
many burdens laid on you, even if you should develop 
' various sorts of knowledge.' " 

" I do not pretend to all kinds," and she smiles gayly. 
" How curiously ignorant the children are about the true 
meaning of most everything ! When they stare at you 
wide-eyed and open-mouthed, you are lost in a sort of won- 
der as to how you will ever be able to arouse the dormant 
faculties. And there are so many provincialisms ! Why, 
it is as good as going abroad ! I shall be excellently 
entertained." 

" Norman was afraid " — 

" Oh, there is no cause for fear ! " Cynthia's eyes are 
touched with a mirthful light. " I am resolved to earn my 
money by shaking the tree of knowledge vigorously. 
They nmst catch some fruit." 

"It is not that — all things will be so different. But we 
mean to do our best for you ; " and Miss Hilliard smiles 
back to the eyes looking out of the sun-beamed face, carry- 
ing an inspiriting glow. 





It is one of the soft, melancholy days. The leaves have 
mostly, fallen. The hillsides are gray with dead grasses 
and branching shrubs holding out empty hands. The sky 
is in a haze, as if some vague trouble had come to it, and 
it was undecided as to what another day might bring forth. 

She is very bright and adds a charm to their, of late, 
quiet evenings. Winterburne has been much engrossed 
with his books and business matters, but he puts them by 
and watches the face so piquant, and full of cheerful satis- 
factions. Yet he thinks of that other high nature, restless, 
self-tormenting, with its subtle pride and unanswered de- 
sires. His own hearty vitality will not allow him to drop 
into despondency, even where she is concerned. It is 
really not her time to love, and he is proud of her now 
that she did not take his generous proffer. If she had 
been kindlier, if she had softened the denial by some of 
the little arts the women in stories use, he would be glad 
to remember it, to recall a droop of the figure, a turning 
away of the face, a sweet pity in the eyes, a divine anguish 
in the voice. It would be like the lingering fragrance of 
flowers, given in some unguarded moment, yet not the 
revelation of love. 

There is so much work for the strong, high-hearted man. 
Since he has not the key to that other soul, he cannot go 
fumbling around in darkened, out-of-the-way places, vainly 
searching. There are too many things needing to be done. 
Some of them may be wrong, and he will be compelled to 
retrace his steps, wiser by the experience. He will find new 
ways. Ah, if he might infuse a little of that glowing 
endeavor into the nature striving so blindly for what 
belongs to her true growth. 

By the week's end Cynthia has her school in tolerable 
order. She takes all the amusing points home with her, 
the opening of the hall and the addresses, the various plans 
for bringing some mental electric lighting to stolid, be- 
nighted Warwick. Her bright energy lifts even Eegina 
out of the shadow of herself, and infuses new life. 

Tor a while every one seems much engrossed. Miss 



 

Hilliard is kept extremely busy, but she comes up with 
Cynthia and helps to cheer Mrs. Halford's despondency. 
Wiuterburne has kept his own counsel too well even for his 
cherished sister to suspect the passage between him and 
Regina. All her indignation would be roused, he knows 
well, and in his tender soul he will not have the other 
blamed for what she cannot give. 







CHAPTER XXII 

WINTER SOWING 
To do some one good and win some love. — DiCKENS. 

It seems to be a fact that has puzzled more than one re- 
generator of his species that the so-called lower classes are 
not easily awakened to any sense of mental improvement, 
hardly to greater physical comforts. They may not be 
satisfied with the present state of things, but they have 
also a wholesome fear of something worse, since most of 
their changes are for the worse. And Wayne Armitage 
finds this a great stumbling-block in his work. A number 
of them are easily swayed in their religious feelings, the 
women especially. They come to church on Sunday, and 
the sermon may move them emotionally. They believe 
the larger truths ; they have, as they put it, made their 
peace with God, and they are quite sure of heaven at the 
last. The fatal lack seems to lie in the belief that they 
are doing their best when they do not apply one truth to 
their daily living. What shall arouse them, what shall 
bring them to the grand comprehension of true living, of 
real working when one comes to depend not on bread alone ? 

He has, in his inexperience, imagined that fine simplicity 
approaching grandeur among country folk who commune 
much with nature in her lofty splendor. It may be in 
purely pastoral lives, removed from the ordinary strife of 
business; but here they ape the sins of the cities, and 
seem more immovably fixed in their ways. 

Instead of mountain and sky and changing seasons, they 
study the week's wages and how to get the greatest amount 
of personal indulgence without actually starving the 
household. They have no expectation of doing any better. 



 

few of them have any ambition for their children. They 
will come up and find something to do, they will marry or 
go to new places and forget about their parents The 
blending of different races with wild ideas of liberty 
grafted on the older systems of repression, the aggregation
