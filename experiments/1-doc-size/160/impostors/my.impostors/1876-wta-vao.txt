a corner, under which reposed three pigs, while a lot
of hens were picking up crumbs thrown to them by
a couple of half–naked children. It was the proper
habitation of the pigs, rather than the human beings.
The onslaughts of the beggars were so savage that the
visitors were compelled to beat a hasty retreat. The
women teased the surgeon to enter their grottos in
order to get the fee.

In the evening some British officers from “Gib,” as
they always call the great fortress, had a gypsy dance
at the Siete Suelos. The doctor and his pupils were
invited to attend. There were two men dressed in full
Spanish costume, and three girls, also in costume, one
of whom was quite pretty. One of the men was the
captain of the gypsies, and played the guitar with marvellous
skill, an exhibition of which he gave the party.
There was nothing graceful about the dancing: it was
simply peculiar, with a curious jerking of the hips. At
times the dancers indulged in a wild song. When the
show was finished, the gypsy girls made an energetic
demonstration on the audience for money, and must
have collected a considerable sum from the officers, for
they used all the arts of the coquette.

Just at dark a small funeral procession passed the
hotel. It was preceded by half a dozen men bearing
great candles lighted. The coffin was borne on the
shoulders of four more, and was highly ornamented.
The funeral party were singing or chanting, but so
irreverently that the whole affair seemed more like a
frolic than a funeral.

“That is a gay–looking coffin,” said Murray to
Mariano Ramos, the best guide and courier in Spain,
who had been in the employ of the principal since the
squadron arrived at Malaga.

“That is all for show,” laughed Mariano. “The
men will bring it back with them.”

“Don’t they bury the dead man in it?”

“No: that would make it too expensive for poor
folks. They tumble the dead into a rough box, or
bury him without any thing.”

The next morning the excursionists started for Cordova,
and arrived late at night, going by the same route
they had taken to Granada as far as Bobadilla.




CHAPTER XXIV.

AN ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD.


In twelve hours after she started, the American
Prince was in the harbor of Cadiz. Bark Lingall
was on board; and Jacob Lobo, who spoke five languages,
had been engaged at the Hotel de la Alameda
as his companion. Mr. Pelham sent them ashore as
soon as the anchor went over the bow.

“Do you expect to find the Count de Escarabajosa
in Cadiz?” asked the interpreter, as they landed.

“Of course not: I told you he would not be here,”
replied Bark. “I may find out where he went to from
here, and I may not. I left him at the Hotel de Cadiz;
and we will go there first.”

“I can tell you where he went without asking a
question,” added Lobo, to whom Bark had told the
whole story of Raymond.

“I can guess at it, as you do; but I want information
if I can obtain it,” replied Bark.

“You would certainly have been caught if you hadn’t
thrown the detective off the track by going over to
Oran.”

“We went to Oran for that purpose.”

“The count has got out of Spanish territory, and he
will keep out of it for the present. Our next move will
be to go to Gibraltar. He is safe there.”

“I think we shall find him there.”

The landlord of the hotel recognized Bark, who had
been a guest in his house for several weeks. Raymond
had not told him where he was going when he left. He
had gone from the hotel on foot, carrying his bag in his
hand.

“Where do you think he went?” asked Bark.

“My opinion at the time was that he went to Gibraltar;
for a steamer sailed for Algeciras that day, and
there was none for any other port,” replied the landlord.

“But he might have left by the train,” suggested
Bark.

“He went away in the middle of the day, and the
steamer left at noon.”

“He did not leave by train,” added the guide.

“I don’t think he did,” said Bark. “Now, when
does the next steamer leave for Gibraltar?”

“You will find the bills of the steamers hanging in
the hall,” replied the landlord.

One of these indicated that a Spanish steamer
would sail at noon the next day.

“Perhaps she will, and perhaps she will not,” said
Lobo.

“But she is advertised to leave to–morrow,” added
Bark.

“Very likely before night you may find another bill,
postponing the departure till the next day: they do
such things here.”

“What shall we do?”

“Wait till a steamer sails,” replied Lobo, shrugging
his shoulders.

“Is there any other way to get there?” asked Bark,
troubled by the uncertainty.

“Some other steamer may come along: we will go
to the office of the French line, and inquire when one
is expected,” replied Jacob.

They ascertained that the French steamer did not
touch at Gibraltar; and there was no other way than
to depend upon the Spanish line. As Jacob Lobo had
feared, the sailing of the boat advertised was put off
till the next day.

“You can go by land, if you are not afraid of the
brigands,” said the interpreter.

“Brigands?”

“Within a year a party of English people were
robbed by brigands, on the way from Malaga to
Ronda; but that is the only instance I ever heard of.
The country between here and Malaga used to be
filled with smugglers; and there are some of that trade
