social inequality exists between you and me?"

"Between you and your servant?" she inquired mockingly.  And tried to
pass me.

"You didn’t mean that!  You meant something entirely different.  Who are
you, Thusis?  And I don’t care a sou who you are,—what you are! I am
in love with you——"

"—And with my sister?"

"I’m in love with you!  You know it!"

"I do not!"

"You do know it!  And it disturbs you——"

My voice shook.

"It leaves me utterly indifferent," she said disdainfully; but her gray
eyes were lifted slowly to mine and the color came into her beautiful
face.

"What sort of man are you!" she demanded. "You see how young my sister
is—how silly and inexperienced!  And yet——"

"I’d as soon kiss a healthy kitten," said I.  "She’s attractive because
she is your sister.  Anyway Smith is in love with her——"

"I won’t permit it!" cried Thusis.  "I’ll not tolerate such a thing!"

She clenched her hands; there was a glint of something in her eyes—but
if it came from angry tears they dried before I was sure.

"I’ve brought this on myself," she said.  "I laid myself open to
it—invited familiarity and disrespect from you!  The very devil must
have been in me to so utterly forget myself!  Now I’ve got to pay for
it—pay for it in bitter humiliation—witness such a scene as I have just
witnessed—and then stand here and hear you tell me that—that you are in
love with me!—endure what you say——"

Suddenly it became clear to me what Clelia had meant when she said that
Thusis was afraid of me.

"Thusis," said I, "you won’t have to listen to any more of that from me.
I shall not tell you again that I care for you.  And anyway, in a little
while it will no longer be true.  Because I shall get over it."

She looked up.

"And I want you to know that I am not angry. And even if I were I want
you to understand that you need not be afraid of my resentment."

"I am not!" she flashed out.

"You are!  You are afraid that I might be the sort of creature to
revenge wounded amour propre by proving faithless to the confidence you
gave me. Don’t worry," I added angrily, "because I’d cut my tongue out
or face a firing squad before I’d utter one word to anybody concerning
what you told me about your mission here."

There was a silence.  Then Thusis’ smile came back, a trifle
tremulously:

"You silly boy!" she said.  "Did you think I was afraid of that!"

"You say that, in my case, noblesse oblige means nothing to me."

She blushed scarlet: "I was angry—hurt.  I did not mean that."

"You meant it."

"I did not!  I tried to believe I meant it.  I knew it wasn’t true.  I
knew it would anger you; that is why I said it."

"Then why are you afraid of me?"

"I?"

"Yes, you, Thusis."

"I am not.  I am afraid of nobody....  Except ... myself."

She looked up at me again, flushed, lovely, and her gray eyes seemed
distressed.

"It’s just myself, Don Michael," she said with a forced smile.  "I seem
changed, different,—and it alarms me—scares me—to find myself capable of
behaving so—so imprudently—with you."

"Thusis!"

But she had passed me in a flash and I heard her light feet flying up
the stairs.  I followed.  She was at the top of the staircase, but heard
me and turned on the landing to look down.

"My behavior with you mortifies me!" she repeated in a hurried whisper.
"Why do you follow me, Michael?"

"Do you have to ask me, Thusis?"

"You mustn’t ever again pursue me," she repeated in a low, breathless
voice.

"Why do you say that?"

"Because—possibly I couldn’t run as fast as you can.  Do you think I
would endure it to be overtaken?  Do you suppose I could tolerate being
run down and caught?  By you?  Can’t you comprehend that such a thing
is unthinkable?"

Again that slightest hint of contempt in her voice, not entirely
recognized yet vaguely divined.

I said slowly: "If I really understand, Thusis, then you need not worry.
Because I shall never again take a single step in the world to follow
you."

She seemed to consider this very deeply, standing on the landing and
looking down at me out of her beautiful and serious eyes.

"Suppose," she said, "that you do follow me—not very fast—just saunter
along—so that I need not run?"

She did not smile; neither did I.

"Would that be agreeable to you, Michael?"

"Would it be agreeable to you, Thusis?"

"Yes, it would....  Please don’t come upstairs! Does it give you any
pleasure to scare me and see me run?"

I had one foot on the stairs; and let it remain there.

"When I say saunter, I mean it, Michael.  Just stroll around—in my
vicinity—describing a few leisurely circles—so that I’ll not notice your
approach.  Couldn’t you do that—and keep within sight?"

"I’ll try."

Suddenly her eyes grew brilliant and she smothered a laugh with her
hands.  Then, as both palms clung flat to her laughing lips she
deliberately kissed them and, with a pretty gesture, threw the reckless
salute at me.

"Your humble servant, Don Michael!" she whispered, "your housekeeper
salutes you—and runs!"

Which she did, vanishing like a flash of sunlight in the dusky corridor.

I dropped one hand on the newel-post quite unbalanced by a complexity of
emotions which no experience in life had so far taught me to analyze and
catalogue.

"It’s probably love," said I to myself, calmly enough.  "And what the
devil am I to do about it?"

There was no answer.  Reason, instinct, emotion, appeared to be
paralyzed.
