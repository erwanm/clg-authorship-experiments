Rupert had been a bell-boy for more than a year. He found his employers
very pleasant and considerate, and his salary was larger, probably, than
he could get anywhere else. Still the position was not likely to lead to
anything better, unless he might in time qualify himself to be a hotel
clerk.

Sometimes he talked over the matter with Leslie, but the latter had the
advantage of knowing just what he aspired to. He was determined some day
to be an actor, and was content to remain in his present place till
there was an opening for him on the stage.

One day Rupert received a letter from Colorado. He knew, of course, that
the letter was written by his old acquaintance, Giles Packard, from whom
he heard occasionally. This was the letter:


     "FRIEND RUPERT--

     "I have been meaning for some time to write to you, but my mode of
     life is not favorable to letter-writing, and whenever I take my pen
     in hand I feel as awkward as a Chinaman would with a knife and
     fork. I think it is three months since I heard from you, but I hope
     you are well and getting on nicely. How is the little boy you took
     charge of? It was a pretty big responsibility for a lad of your
     age, but I am sure you would take better care of him than a good
     many older persons.

     "Don't forget that you promised to let me know if you needed some
     help. Even small boys cost something to bring up, and I have
     plenty, while you are only beginning life. I suppose you are still
     a bell-boy at the Somerset Hotel. Now that is a good position for a
     boy, but it seems to me that it is about time you took up something
     else. Before choosing what it shall be, I want you to come out and
     make me a visit. I feel pretty lonely sometimes, having neither
     'chick nor child,' unless I count you. I think it would do you good
     to see a little something of the far West. I inclose a draft for
     two hundred dollars for your expenses out here. If all is right I
     want you either to ask for a vacation or leave your situation, and
     start as soon as you can. Don't be afraid, for I will see that you
     don't suffer, even if you don't get a new place right off."


Here followed some directions as to finding him, and then the letter
ended.

The proposal struck Rupert favorably. He had a natural desire to
travel, and had a great anxiety to see Chicago and other places, of
which he had heard a great deal.

He went at once to the proprietor of the hotel and showed him the
letter.

"You want to accept the invitation, I suppose?" said the landlord.

"Yes, sir, if it won't inconvenience you."

"As it happens, one of my old friends wants me to give his son a place
in the hotel. I had thought of discharging Leslie to make room for him,
but if you really wish to give up your position I will put him in your
place."

"That will suit me, sir."

"But in that case I cannot take you back on your return."

"I will not expect you to do so. I think I can find something outside,
and Mr. Packard agreed to see me through."

"That draft looks like it. I will send for the boy at once, and during
the balance of the week you can instruct him in his duties."

"I am sorry you are going, Rupert," said Leslie. "If you get acquainted
with any managers on your Western trip, speak a good word for me."

"I will."

"I am going to play at a benefit next week, Wednesday. It is a variety
entertainment, and I am to give imitations of celebrated actors. I've
got Irving down fine. You ought to stay and see me."

"Perhaps you will give me a private rehearsal. It wouldn't be convenient
for me to put off my journey."

"I will. Come into my room to-night, and you shall see me imitate
Irving, Booth and Joe Jefferson."

Rupert stayed two days in Chicago, and visited the principal localities,
including Jackson Park, soon to become known all over the country as the
site of the World's Fair. He was impressed with the business activity
and greatness of the Queen City of the West, and left it reluctantly at
the end of two days. At the railroad station, while purchasing his
ticket to Denver, his attention was called to a tall old man who looked
to be nearly seventy. He was thin and bent, and his face was sad. His
suit was black, but it was well-worn and looked shabby. His eyes were
fixed on Rupert as he bought his ticket, and he heaved a sigh.

"I envy you, young man," he said in answer to Rupert's inquiring look.

"Why so?" asked the bell-boy.

"Because you are going to Denver."

"Do you wish to go there?"

"Yes, but it is impossible."

"Why is that? Won't your business permit you?"

"Alas, I have no business. I came to Chicago from my old home in
Rochester, New York, hoping to get a situation as bookkeeper. I
understand bookkeeping thoroughly, and for fifteen years occupied that
position in one of the largest firms in Buffalo. But they went out of
business, and I was thrown on my own resources."

"Had you not laid up any money?"

"Yes. I took what I had, and went by invitation to make my home at the
house of a niece in Rochester who was married to a man named Jackson. I
had three thousand dollars, and I thought that if I should get
something to do I might with the help of that live comfortably for the
balance of my days. That was a year ago, and I was then sixty-five. I
can hardly expect to live many years, and I considered myself well
provided for.

"Well, I sought out my niece, and was cordially received by her husband
and herself after they learned that I had money. I agreed to board with
them, and sought a position in my old line. But a man over sixty is at a
disadvantage when he is seeking employment. In vain I showed a
first-class recommendation from my past employers in Buffalo.

"'I dare say you understand your business,' one and another said to me,
'but you are too old for us. We want a young man who can hustle.'

"'But I can hustle, too,' I said.

"They only laughed.

"'You are too old to work. You ought to retire,' they said.

"I reported my disappointment to my niece and her husband.

"'Uncle John,' said my nephew, 'I feel for you, and I will try to do
something for you. I think I can make a place for you in my store. I
can't afford to pay you high wages. If you will work for ten dollars a
week I will employ you.'

"I was very glad to accept this proposal, though I had in my time been
paid a hundred dollars a month.

"I entered the store, and had reason to think that I was doing
satisfactory work. But at the end of three weeks Eben Jackson called me
aside and said: 'Uncle John, I have been figuring up my expenses, and I
don't see how I can afford to employ you.'

"'You wish me to go, then?'

"'I shall have to dispense with your services unless I can get
additional capital to enlarge my business.'
