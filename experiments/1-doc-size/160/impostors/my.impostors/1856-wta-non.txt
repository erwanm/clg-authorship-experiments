" When you want any assistance of any kind, came 
to me. I live in Boston ; here is my business card." 

Mr. Bayajd handed him a card, on which Bobby 
read, " F. Bayard & Co., Booksellers and Publishers, No. : Washington Street, Boston," 
"You are very land, sir.'' 


" I want you should come to Boston and see us 
too," interposed Ellen. " I should be delighted to 
show you the city, to take you to the Athenaeum and 
the Museum." 

" Thank you." 

Mr. Bayard inquired of Bobby about his parents, 
where he lived, and about the circumstances of his 
family. He then took out his memorandum book, in 
which he wrote the boy's name and residence. 

" I am sorry to leave you now, Robert, but J. have 
over twenty miles to ride to-day. I should be glad 
to visit your mother, and next time I come to Riverdale, I shall certainly do so." 

'' Thank you, sir ; my mother is a very poor woman, 
but she will be glad to see you." 

" Now, good by, Robert." 

" Good by," repeated Ellen. 

" Good by." 

Mr. Bayard drove off, leaving Bobby standing on 
the bridge with the gold pieces in his hand. 

" Here's luck ! ' said Bobby, shaking the coin. 
" Won't mother's eyes stick out when she sees these 
shiners ? There are no such shiners in the river as 
these.' 




Bobby was astonished, and the more he gazed at 
the gold pieces, the more bewildered he became. He 
had never held so much money in his hand before. 
There were three large coins and one smaller one. 
He turned them over and over, and finally ascertained 
that the large coins were ten dollar pieces, and the 
smaller one a five dollar piece. Bobby was not a 
great scholar, but he knew enough of arithmetic to 
calculate the value of his treasure. He was so excited, 
however, that he did not arrive at the conclusion half 
so quick as most of my young readers would have 
done. 

" Thirty-five dollars ! " exclaimed Bobby, whei> the 
problem was solved. " Gracious I ' ! 

" Hallo, Bob ! ' shouted Tom Spicer, who had 
got tired of fishing ; besides, the village clock was 
just striking twelve, and it was time for him to go 
home. 

Bobby made no answer, but hastily tying the gold 
pieces up in the corner of his handkerchief, he threw 
the broken rail he had used in stopping the horse 
where it belonged, and started for the place where he 
had left his fishing apparatus. 



 

"Hallo, Bob!" 

"Well, Tom?" 

" Stopped him didn't you ? ' : 

"I did." 

" You were a fool ; he might have killed you." 

" So he might ; but I didn't stop to think of that. 
The lady's life was in danger." 

"What of that?" 

" Every thing, I should say." 

" Did he give you any thing ? ' 

" Yes ; ' and Bobby continued his walk down to 
the river's side. 

" I say, what did he give you, Bobby ? " persisted 
Tom, following him. 

" O, he gave me a good deal of money." 

" How much?' ! 

" I want to get my fish line now ; I will tell you 
all about it some other time," replied Bobby, who 
rather suspected the intentions of his companion. 

" Tell me now ; how much was it ? ' : 

" Never mind it now." 

" Humph ! Do you think I mean to rob you ? " 

"No." 


"Ain't you going halveses ? ' : 
Why should I?" 

"Wasn't I with you?" 

" Were you ? ' 

" Wasn't I fishing with you ? " 

" You did not do any thing about stopping the 
horse." 

"I would, if I hadn't been afraid to go up to the 
road." 

" Afraid ? " 

" Somebody might have seen me, and they would 
have known that I was hooking jack." 

" Then you ought not to share the money." 

" Yes, I had. When a fellow is with you, he ought 
to have half. It is mean not to give him half." 

" If you had done any thing to help stop the horse, 
I would have shared with you. But you didn't." 

" What of that ? " 

Bobby was particularly sensitive in regard to the 
-inarge of meanness. His soul was a great deal bigger than his body, and he was always generous, even 
to his own injury, among his companions. It was 
evident to him that Tom had no claim to any part of 




the reward ; but he could not endure the thought 
even of being accused of meanness. 

" I'll tell you what I will do, if you think I ought 
to share with you. I will leave it out to Squire Lee ;
