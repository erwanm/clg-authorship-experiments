" But people remember you are alive. O, 
Maria, they remember you too. Mr. Rich 
mond don't forget you ; and Miss Benton 
asked you to come to tea with her." 

" It is all very well talking," said Maria. 
" I know what I know ; and I am getting 
tired of it. You are the only one that has 
any really good times." 

It soon appeared that one of Matilda's 
good times was not to be to-day. Mrs. Can- 




dy and Clarissa looked on her coldly, spoke 
to her dryly, and made her feel that she was 
not in favour. Matilda could bear this down 
stairs pretty well ; but when she found her 
self in Mrs. Candy's room for her morning 
hours of reading and darning, it became 
heavy. Reading was not the first thing to 
day. Mrs. Candy called Matilda to stand 
before her while she proceeded to give her a 
species of correction in words. 

" You were baptized a few weeks ago, 
Matilda." 

" Yes, ma'am." 

" And by so being, you became a member 
of the church ; of your church." 

" Yes, ma'am." 

" What do you think are the duties of a 
member of the church ? " 

A comprehensive question, Matilda thought. 
She hesitated. 

" I ask you, what do you think are the 
duties of a member of the church ? in any 
branch of it." 



 

" I suppose they are the same as anybody 
else's duties," Matilda answered. 

" The same as anybody else's duties." 

" Yes, aunt Candy." 

" You think it makes no change in one's 
duties ? " 

" What change does it make, aunt Can 
dy?" 

Matilda spoke in all innocence; but Mrs. 
Candy flushed and frowned. It did not 
sweeten her mood, that she could not readily 
find an answer for the child. 

" You allow, at least, that it is one of your 
duties to obey the fifth commandment?" 

" Yes, aunt Candy. I try to do it." 

" Did you try last night ? " 

Matilda was silent. 

" You made me guilty of rudeness by not 
delivering the message I had charged you 
with ; and you confessed it was not through 
forgetfulness. Will you tell me now why it 
was ? " 

It had been through a certain nice sense on 




Matilda's part that the message was uncalled 
for, and even a little officious. She would 
have been mortified to be obliged to repeat it 
to Mrs. Laval. There had never been the 
least intercourse between the ladies, and Mrs. 
Laval had sought none. If Mrs. Candy 
sought it, Matilda was unwilling it should 
be through her means. But she could not 
explain this to her aunt. 

" You did not choose it," that lady said 
again, with kindling anger. 

" I did not mean to offend you, aunt Candy." 

" No, because you thought I would never 
hear of it. I have a great mind, as ever I 
had to eat, to whip you, Matilda. You are 
not at all too old for it, and I believe it would 
do you a great deal of good. You haven't 
had quite enough of that sort of thing." 

"Whether Matilda had or had not had 
enough of that sort of thing, it seemed to 
her that it was very far from Mrs. Candy's 
place to propose or even hint at it. The 



 

indignity of the proposal flushed the child 
with a sense of injury almost too strong to 
be borne. Mrs. Candy, in all her years of 
life, had never known the sort of keen pain 
that her words gave now to a sensitive 
nature, up to that time held in the most 
dainty and tender consideration. Matilda 
did not speak nor stir ; but she grew pale. 

" The next time you shall have it," Mrs. 
Candy went on. " I should have no hesita 
tion at all, Matilda, about whipping you; and 
my hand is not a light one. I advise you as 
your friend not to come under it. Your 
present punishment shall be, that I shall 
refuse you permission to go any more to Mrs. 
Laval's." 

The child was motionless and gave no 
sign, further than the paleness of her cheeks 
which indeed caught Clarissa's observant eye 
and made her uneasy. But she did not tremble nor weep. Probably the rush of feeling 
made such a storm in her little breast that 
she could not accurately measure the value of 



 

this new announcement, or know fairly what 
it meant. Perhaps too it was like some 
other things to her limited experience, too 
bad to be believed; and Matilda did not 
really receive it as a fact, that her visits to 
Mrs. Laval had ceased. She realized enough, 
however, poor child, to make it extremely 
difficult to bear up and maintain her dignity ; 
but she did that. Nothing but the pale 
ness told. Matilda was quite erect and steady 
before her aunt ; and when she was at last
