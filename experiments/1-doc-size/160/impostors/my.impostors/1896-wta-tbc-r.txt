voters" of Rippleton had at the town meeting they had attended.

Frank, in the words of the newspaper reporters, "made a neat and
appropriate speech," on the occasion of taking possession of the new
hall. After this important matter had been disposed of, the coxswain
remarked that the first business of the club would be to select a name
for the hall.

"Mr. Chairman," said Charles Hardy, rising with the utmost gravity and
decorum.

Uncle Ben laughed outright; but immediately apologized for his unseemly
mirth, and fearful lest he should disturb the dignified body again, he
withdrew from the hall, and busied himself in polishing up the brass
work of the boat.

"Charles Hardy," said the young chairman, bowing to the member who had
obtained the floor.

"I move that this hall, hereafter, henceforward, and for all time to
come, be called Sedley Hall," said Charles, who, in the absence of any
work on parliamentary tactics in his father's library, had carefully
studied the "Business Man's Assistant," from which he had stored his
memory with a variety of legal and technical phrases. He had the jingle
of them in his head, and did not mind much about the substance.

Captain Sedley entered the hall just as he made his motion.

"Second the motion," said Fred Harper.

"It is moved and seconded that this room be called Sedley Hall,"
continued the coxswain, rising from the chair. "The question is open
for discussion."

"Mr. Chairman," said Captain Sedley, scarcely able to control his
inclination to indulge in a hearty laugh at the dignity and formality
of the proceedings, "though not, strictly speaking, a member of the
club, perhaps you will indulge me in a few remarks on the question
before the house. I am very grateful to you for the honor to my name
and family which is contemplated by the excellent member on the other
side of the table; but for reasons of my own, I must beg the gentleman
to withdraw his motion."

"He cannot withdraw without the consent of the house--of the club, I
mean," said Frank, blushing at his blunder.

"It is customary when no objection is made," replied Captain Sedley
gravely, "to permit a motion to be withdrawn."

"Mr. Chairman," said Charles, rising, "for the obvious reasons
mentioned by the honorable and distinguished gentleman, I withdraw my
motion."

At the risk of disturbing the dignity of the meeting, Captain Sedley
remarked that he had stated no reasons.

"I move that the room be called Zephyr Hall," said Tony Weston.

"Second the motion," said Charles.

Frank stated the question, and observed that it was open for any
remarks. But the members, not feeling disposed to indulge in any
flights of eloquence before Captain Sedley, maintained an obstinate
silence for full five minutes. The chairman, impressed with the idea
that some speeches must be made, anyhow, did not interrupt the
dignified quiet by putting the question.

At last the silence was broken by a hearty laugh on the part of Captain
Sedley.

"Why don't you put the question, Frank?" asked he.

"The debate has not taken place yet."

"There are some questions which it is not necessary to debate."

"Question!" said Fred Harper, who had been to town meeting.

"Those in favor of calling the room Zephyr Hall, please manifest it by
raising the right hand."

"All up!" cried Fred Harper.

"It is a unanimous vote," added the chairman.

"Let the clerk record the vote," whispered Captain Sedley to his son.

"We have no clerk yet."

"Doing business without a clerk!" laughed his father.

"The next business will be to choose a clerk," continued Frank,
laughing. "Please to bring in your ballots for a clerk."

There were paper and pens at the other end of the table; and Fred
Harper, who seemed to have a very good idea of "the manner in which the
public business is transacted," commenced writing votes. In a few
moments they were all supplied.

"I move that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to collect,
sort, and count the votes, and report to the meeting," said Fred.

"Second the motion," added Tom Greene.

The motion was put and carried.

"The chair appoints Frederic Harper, Thomas Greene, and Mark Leman."

The votes were collected and reported.

"Whole number of votes, thirteen," repeated Frank; "necessary for a
choice, seven; Frederic Harper has one; Anthony Weston has twelve, and
is elected."

Captain Sedley clapped his hands at this evidence of good will on the
part of the members, and the club all joined heartily in the
demonstration. Three days before, the grand jury had found a bill
against Tony; but his friends still continued to regard and treat him
as an innocent person.

"I thank you for your kindness," said Tony, rising; "I am sure, I--"
but the poor fellow choked up, and could say no more.

His heart was full, and the great tears rolled down his cheeks.

"Never mind it, Tony; here is the record-book," said Fred Harper,
taking it from the library case.

Tony wiped away his tears, and seated himself at the foot of the table,
where a small desk had been placed for the use of the clerk.

"Mr. Chairman," said Charles Hardy.

Frank nodded to him to indicate that he had the floor.

"I move that a committee of three be appointed to draft and report a
constitution for the club."

"Second the motion," added Sam Harper.

The motion prevailed. Charles Hardy, Tony Weston, and Fred Harper were
nominated "at large," and chosen to serve on this committee. Leaving
the hall, they retired to the boat-room for deliberation; but the
constitution had already been prepared by Frank and Charles, with the
assistance of Captain Sedley. To make the business look more important
and dignified, Charles insisted on remaining out a few moments, during
which time they talked over the matter with Uncle Ben.

When they returned, the constitution was duly reported, and adopted
article by article.

Perhaps my young readers would not readily appreciate the moral of my
story without reading this important document; therefore I add, in
full, the

    CONSTITUTION.

    ARTICLE I.

    This association shall be called the Zephyr Boat Club.
