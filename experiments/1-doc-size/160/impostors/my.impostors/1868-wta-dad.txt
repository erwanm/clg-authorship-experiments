exultingly.

"By no means. Enough has been shown to warrant an inquiry. I will make
an investigation immediately."

This was all Mr. Hamblin could ask; and, confident that Captain Kendall
would be convicted, he left the cabin, as the captain of the Belgian
steamer came in to settle for the towage.




CHAPTER XVI.

CAPTAIN KENDALL'S DEFENCE.


The squadron remained off Flushing long enough for Mr. Fluxion to visit
the shore, and ascertain the condition of the "Wel tevreeden." The
repairs were going on, but were not completed, and the cost of them
could not yet be determined. The vice-principal, however, obtained such
information in regard to the probable expense, as to enable him to make
a final settlement. Captain Schimmelpennink came off to the Josephine
with him on his return. It was certain that eleven hundred guilders
would cover the whole expense of putting the galiot in perfect repair,
and the balance of this sum was handed to the skipper.

If there ever was a grateful man in the world, that man was the captain
of the "Wel tevreeden." In addition to the energetic speeches he made
through the interpreter, he indulged in some very pretty and significant
gesticulations, which the officers and crew could comprehend. The
students were happy in the good deed they had done--quite as happy as
the the skipper himself. In addition to the sum expended, there was five
hundred and fifty-four guilders in the hands of the treasurer, which was
to be used for some similar object when presented to them.

While Mr. Fluxion was absent at Flushing, Mr. Lowington had gone on
board of the Josephine, and, taking Paul into his state-room, had
exhibited the fictitious note to him, stating the charge made against
him by Mr. Hamblin.

"I need not say, Captain Kendall, that this is a very serious charge,"
added the principal, solemnly.

"I think it is, sir," replied Paul, blushing deeply. "If you think I
wrote that letter, sir, I hope you will do your duty."

"I certainly shall, though it break my heart."

"Whatever you do, sir, it will not alter my regard for you."

"I am already accused of partiality towards you, Captain Kendall," added
Mr. Lowington. "I confess that I never had a pupil for whom I cherished
so high an esteem and so warm a regard."

"Thank you, sir. You are now, as you always have been, very kind to me,"
replied Paul, hardly able to restrain the tears in which his emotions
demanded expression.

"I must say that I deem this charge groundless and absurd; but I cannot
explain it away. The writing in the note resembles yours in some
respects; and the fact that the kind of paper on which the note is
written is found in your possession alone has not been explained. Do you
know anything about this note?"

"Nothing, sir; only that it came in the mail with the rest of the
Josephine's letters."

"When did you get the paper which Mr. Hamblin found in your writing
desk?"

"I bought it in Antwerp on Tuesday afternoon, when we went on shore,"
replied Paul, promptly.

"I shall be obliged to inquire further into this matter. You will have
all hands called."

They left the state-room together, and the first lieutenant ordered the
ship's company to be piped to quarters. Without any definite
explanation, the principal directed all the students to bring their
stock of stationery on deck, and they passed in review before him,
exhibiting the quality of their paper. At the same time Mr. Stoute
searched the steerage for any which might have been concealed. If any
student had purchased paper in Antwerp, it was not of the kind on which
the forged letter had been written.

"Young gentlemen," said Mr. Lowington, mounting his rostrum, "a
practical joke is the stupidest thing in the world, when perpetrated at
the expense of the feelings of others. Some one has put such a joke upon
Mr. Hamblin, the very last person in the world to appreciate this
species of humor. One of your number is charged with the act."

"The old lunatic has laid it to the captain," whispered Terrill, who
thus interpreted the mysterious proceedings of the principal and Paul.

"The particular kind of paper on which the letter to Mr. Hamblin was
written is found only in the possession of that one student," continued
the principal, with an emotion he could not wholly conceal. "I desire,
if any of you have any information in regard to the note, that you will
communicate it at once."

Mr. Lowington paused, and the boys looked blankly at each other. Even to
them, at that moment, a practical joke seemed to be the stupidest thing
in the world. There was a tremendous sensation among them; but no one
volunteered to give the desired information.

"Young gentlemen, although the evidence in my possession is not
sufficient to condemn the student charged with the offence, it is enough
to justify grave suspicions, and I shall be under the painful necessity
of suspending him, and sending him on board of the ship for further
examination."

Paul was not half so much disturbed by this announcement as he had been
by the trying scene with Mr. Hamblin, a few days before. It is the
guilt, and not the loss of honor, the disgrace, which is hard to bear
when one is charged with misconduct or crime. He stood with folded arms,
submissive to the authority of the principal, and satisfied that the
truth would prevail in the end.

"Who is he?" asked one of the students in a suppressed tone, when the
silence became painful.

"Captain Kendall," replied the principal; and this name produced a
tremendous thrill in the hearts of the ship's company.

"No, sir! No, sir!" shouted some of the students.

"Silence, young gentlemen! I know how you feel," interposed Mr.
Lowington. "Although it would seem to me impossible that Captain Kendall
should have written this letter, Mr. Hamblin distinctly charges him with
the act, and I am sorry to add that there is some evidence to prove the
charge."

Mr. Lowington was more grieved than any other person on board, and it is
more than probable that, in his great anxiety to avoid partiality, he
ran into the opposite extreme, and exposed himself to the peril of
doing injustice to his young friend.

"Captain Kendall, you will consider yourself under arrest, and report on
board of the ship," added the principal, turning to Paul.

The young commander bowed submissively, and the boys wondered how he was
able to take the matter so coolly.

"It's a shame!" exclaimed Terrill, in a low tone, to Pelham.

"Mr. Terrill," continued Mr. Lowington, "the command of the Josephine
devolves upon you until further orders, and you will go to sea as soon
as Mr. Fluxion returns."

The first lieutenant started when his name was called, and suspected
that he was to be taken to task for the remark he had just made. It was
fortunate for him, perhaps, that the principal did not hear his
energetic words, or the command might have been given to the second
lieutenant, for Terrill's impulsive nature would have led him into some
intemperate speech, so deeply did he feel for the captain.

"I hope my command will be of very short duration, sir," said he, as the
principal stepped down from the hatch.
