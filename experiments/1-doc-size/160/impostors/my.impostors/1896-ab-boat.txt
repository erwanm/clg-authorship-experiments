and through a gate out upon this 
free moorland wilderness, where, on a 
day of sun overhead and bloom under 
foot, one finds a delight and exhilaration 
suited to the mountain-tops of life. One 
lonely figure only did we overtake on the 
afternoon of our visit, — a tall, gaunt 
woman, with shawl thrown over her 
head, who, swinging her great house-key, 
had been to the churchyard where lay 
her husband's grave. This was the way 
to the " moors," she told us, with an in- 
describable broadening of the vowels. 
 

This path was called the Bronte Walk, 
for Charlotte and her sisters had been 
said to delight in it. It was a lonely 
region, she confessed. She herself had 
come here from the north to be near her 
husband's people ; and now he was dead, 
and she alone. A forlorn place, — but 
the "mo-ors" were company. It was 
easy to see that they might be, in that 
region of gray villages, of sky too often 
clouded, of sweeping winds and drizzling 
rain. It rained as we walked along the 
ling-bordered path, and talked of those 
three women whose hearts and lips had 
been touched with the immortal fire of 
the ideal, and yet to whom duty was ever 
that "stern law-giver" from whose de- 
cree they could never swerve. As we 
wound about one knoll after another of 
the curving moor, lo! the clouds were 
swept aside, and blue sky briefly smiled. 
What tongue can speak the sad beauty 
of the heather with the sun upon it, and 
fleeting shadows chasing the light over 
low-lying valleys in the distance ! That 
day the ling was in full bloom, and 
heather, somewhat earlier in its coming, 
still showed rosy in the sun-patches. 
Ling is far more sober in its general 
 

effect than the common heath ; its tones 
are colder, verging on lilac and gray. 
Yet, close to the eye, it declares even a 
finer grace, a more delicate loveliness, 
than those of its hardy sister. It is the 
Quaker maiden of the barren hills. On 
the left, the moor goes billowing on like 
the fixed heavings of an amethystine sea. 
Leave the path, and take footing in the 
crisp heather that crackles under foot 
with a husky protest, — a ringing of 
whispering chimes, — with the delusive 
hope of hurrying to the top of some 
knoll forming the horizon line, and from 
which you fancy yourself able to see all 
the countries of the earth. It is no easy 
task. Traverse hill and hollow, and 
there are still more knolls, heather-cov- 
ered, and a new horizon line. Perhaps 
he is happier who does not seek the 
highest vantage-ground to over-sweep 
villages in distant valleys, but goes away 
rich in the certainty that he has not seen 
the confines of the moors, and that their 
extent is infinite. On and on sweeps the 
heavenly monotony of these brown-gray 
solitudes. If you cling only to the path, 
you meet an occasional flock of feeding 
sheep ; a tiny watercourse bars the way, 


or a dismal stone house, more cheerless 
company than none, sits frowning at the 
sky. 

But what must they be, these bleak 
hillsides, when the winter wind rages 
across them, and lays waste the land 
with his invisible sword ? One shudders 
as fancy pictures the spot, and shudders 
again, remembering how winter as well 
as summer found three tender women 
here imprisoned in a hermitage they 
loved. Skies might be scowling, and the 
heather a withered waste ; indoors they 
must sit beneath the shadow of their 
father's rigorous life and their brother's 
ruin. Yet were they undaunted, and 
clung to patience, fanning the fire of im- 
agination until their chilled hearts were 
warmer from the glow. Nay, happier 
than that, they were still starved and 
cold ; but for us, for whom they uncon- 
sciously lived, they builded a great bon- 
fire ; for they have stirred us anew with 
that mighty lesson of the power of the 
spirit. O marvelous sway of the few 
endowed with the gift we call genius, 
that though the body faint, and per- 
sonal happiness dies or is still-bom, they 
have yet the strength to build for them- 


selves monuments more enduring than 
brass, which are as finger-posts to all 
other striving souls ! 

Over a little stationer's shop in the 
village was then a sparse collection of 
Bronte relics : pencil drawings, finished 
with the exquisite care characterizing 
every work from Charlotte's fingers, her 
little old-fashioned shawl (somehow so 
like her that it is more precious than 
the whole collection), and various house- 
hold articles bought from the auction- 
sale after her death. The keeper of this 
little store of curiosities was a relative 
of that Martha who had been Tabby's 
helpmate in the kitchen, when she be- 
came too old for work, and yet could 
not be discharged; and it was through 
Martha that many of the articles were 
obtained. Now there is a Bronte Soci- 
ety and a Museum : strange antitheses 
to the seclusion of those shrinking lives. 

It is impossible to look at the Black 
Bull without an unjust feeling of rancor, 
remembering its fascination for Bran- 
well, and its share in his wrong-doing. 
It is a small tavern of the gray stone so 
unfortunately common in the region, and 
such near neighbor is it to the church- 
 

yard that one can easily fancy him leap- 
ing from its window into the yard, as he 
was said to do, when he heard Char- 
lotte's voice, on her way to seek and 
draw him home. 

" Do you want some one to help you 
with your bottle, sir ? " a stranger would 
be asked at the inn. "If you do, I'll 
send up for Patrii:k." And then poor 
Branwell (or Patrick, as he was familiarly 
called) would be swept into those orgies, 
of which the very suspicion covered his 
sisters with shame and horror. 

The actually " passionate pilgrim " 
who leaves unturned no stone beneath 
which lies the weed of remembrance,
