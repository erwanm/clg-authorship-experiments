inner stillness. It grew louder toward morning, and 
then Dryfoos knew from the watcher's deeper 
breathing that he had fallen into a doze. 

He crept by him to the drawing-room, where his 
son was ; the place was full of the awful sweetness 
of the flowers that Fulkerson had brought, and that 
lay above the pulseless breast. The old man turned 
up a burner in the chandelier, and stood looking on 
the majestic serenity of the dead face. 

He could not move when he saw his wife coming 
down the stairway in the hall. She was in her long 
white flannel bedcrown, and the candle she carried 



  

shook with lior nervous tremor. Ho thought slic 
might be -walking in her sleep, but she said, quite 
simply, " I woke up, and I couldn't git to sleep ag'in 
without comin' to have a look." She stood beside 
their dead son with him. " "Well, he 's beautiful, 
Jacob. He was the prettiest baby ! And ho was 
always good, Coonrod was ; I 'll say that for him. 
I don't believe he ever give me a minute's care in 
his whole life. I reckon I liked him about the best 
of all the childern ; but I don't know as I ever done 
much to show it. But you was always good to him, 
Jacob ; you always done the best for him, ever since 
he was a little feller. I used to be afraid you 'd spoil 
him sometimes in them days ; but I guess you 're glad 
now for every time you didn't cross him. I don't 
suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a 
lick." She stooped and peered closer at the face. 
" Why, Jacob, what's that there by his pore eye ?" 
Dryfoos saw it too, the wound that he had feared 
to look for, and that now seemed to redden on his 
sight. He broke into a low, wavering cry, like a 
child's in despair, like an animal's in terror, like a 
soul's in the anguish of remorse. 



VII. 



The evening after the funeral, while the Marches 
sat together talking it over, and making approaches, 
through its shadow, to the question of their own 
future, which it involved, they were startled by the 
twitter of the electric bell at their apartment door. 
It was really not so late as the children's having 
gone to bed made it seem ; but at nine o'clock it was 
too late for any probable visitor except Fulkerson. 
It might be he, and March was glad to postpone the 
impending question to his curiosity concerning the 
immediate business Fulkerson might have with him. 
He went himself to the door, and confronted there 
a lady deeply veiled in black, and attended by a 
very decorous serving-woman. 

"Are you alone, Mr. March — you and Mrs. 
March ? " asked the lady, behind her veil ; and as he 
hesitated, she said, " You don't know me ! Miss 
Vance ; " and she threw back her veil, showing her 
face wan and agitated in the dark folds, "I am 
very anxious to see you — to speak with you both. 
May I come in ? " 

" Why, certainly. Miss Vance," he answered, still 
too much stupefied by her presence to realise it. 




  

She promptly entered, nnti sayincr, wiih a glance 
at the hall chair by the door, "My maid can sit 
here ? " followed him to the room whcre he had left 
his wife. 

Mrs. !March showed herself more capable of coping 
 with the fact. She welcomed Miss Vance with the 
liking they both felt for the girl, and with the 
sympathy which her troubled face inspired. 

"I won't tire you with excuses for coming, Mrs. 
March," she said, "for it was the only thing left for 
me to do ; and I come at my aunt's suggestion." 
She added this as if it would help to account for her 
more on the conventional plane, and she had the 
instinctive good taste to address herself throughout 
to INIrs. March as much as possible, though what she 
had to say was mainly for March. "I don't know 
how to begin-I don't know how to speak of this 
terrible affair. But you know what I mean. I feel 
as if I had lived a whole lifetime since it — happened. 
I don't want you to pity me for it," she said, fore- 
stalling a politeness from Mrs. March. "I'm the 
last one to be thought of, and you mustn't mind mo 
if I try to make you. I came to find out all of the 
truth that I can, and when I know just what that is 
I shall know what to do. I have read the inquest ; 
it's all burnt into my brain. But I don't care for 
that — for myself : you must let me say such things 
without minding me. I know that your husband — 
that Mr. March was there ; I read his testimony ; 

and I wished to ask him — to ask him " She 

stopped and looked distractedly about, " But what 



  

folly ! He must have said everything he knew — he 
had to." Her eyes wandered to him from his wife, 
on whom she had kept them with instinctive tact. 

"I said everything — yes," he replied. "But if 
you would like to know " 

"Perhaps I had better tell you something first. 
I had just parted with him — it couldn't have been 
more than half an hour — in front of Brentano's ; he 
must have gone straight to his death. We were 
talking, and I — I said, Why didn't some one go 
among the strikers and plead with them to be peace- 
able, and keep them from attacking the new men. 
I knew that he felt as I did about the strikers; 
that he M\as their friend. Did you see — do you 
know anything that makes you think he had been 
trying to do that ? " 

"I am sorry," March began, "I didn't sec him at 
all till — till I saw him lying dead." 

"My husband was there purely by accident," 
Mrs. March put in. " I had begged and entreated 
him not to go near the striking anywhere. And he 
had just got out of the car, and saw the policeman 
strike that wretched Lindau — he's been such an 
anxiety to me ever since we have had anything to 
do with him here ; my husband knew him when he 
was a boy in the West. Mr. March came home 
from it all perfectly prostrated ; it made us all sick ! 
Nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before. 
I assure you it was the most shocking experience." 

Miss Vance listened to her with that look of 
patience which those who have seen much of the
