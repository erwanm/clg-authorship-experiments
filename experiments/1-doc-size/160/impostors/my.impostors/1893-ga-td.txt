In the evening the lingering guests of the 
house and the neighbors of the town assembled 
as usual for the dance. Only Estenega ab- 
sented himself. Valencia stood her ground : 
she would not go while Estenega remained. 
Chonita moved proudly among her guests, and 
never had been more gracious. Valencia dared 
not meet her eyes nor mine, but, seeing that 
Prudencia was watching her, avenged her 
own disquiet by enhancing that of the bride. 
Never did she flirt so imperiously with Reinaldo 
as she did that fateful night ; and Reinaldo, 
who was man's vanity collected and com- 
pounded, devoted himself to the dashing beauty. 
Her cheeks burned with excitement, her eyes 
were restless and flashing. 

The music stopped. The women were 
eating the dulces passed by the Indian servants. 
The men had not yet gone into the dining-

room. Valencia dropped her handkerchief; 
Reinaldo, stooping to recover it, kissed her 
hand behind its flimsy shelter. 

Then Prudencia arose. She trailed her long 
gown down the room between the two rows of 
people staring at her grim eyes and pressed lips ; 
her little head, with its high comb, stiffly erect. 
She walked straight up to Reinaldo and boxed 
his ears before the assembled company. 

" Thou wilt flirt no more with other women," 
she said, in a loud, clear voice. "Thou art 
my husband, and thou wilt not forget it again. 
Come with me." 

And, amidst the silence of mountain-tops in 
a snow-storm,, he stumbled to his feet and fol- 
lowed her from the room. 

I could not sleep that night In spite of the 
amusement I had felt at Prudencia's coup-d'etat, 
I was oppressed by the chill and foreboding 
which seemed to emanate from Chonita and 
pervade the house. I knew that terrible calm 
was like the menacing stillness of the hours 
before an earthquake. What would she do in 
the coming convulsion ? I shuddered and 
tormented myself with many imaginings. 

I became so nervous that I rose and dressed 
and went out upon the corridor and walked up 


and down. It was very late, and the moon was 
risen, but the corners were dark. Figures 
seemed to start from them, but my nerves were 
strong ; I never had given way to fear. 

My thoughts wandered to Estenega. Who 
shall judge the complex heart of a man? the 
deep, intense, lasting devotion he may have for 
the one woman he recognizes as his soul's 
own, and yet the strange wayward wanderings 
of his fancy, — the nomadic assertion of the 
animal ; the passionate love he may feel for 
this woman of all women, yet the reserve in 
which he always holds her, never knowing her 
quite as well as he has known other women ; 
the last test of highest love, passion without 
sensuality? And yet the regret that she does 
not gratify every side of his nature, even while 
he would not have her ; regret for the terrible 
incongruity of human nature, the mingling of 
the beast and the divine, which cannot find 
satisfaction in the same woman ; whatever the 
fire in her, she cannot gratify the instincts 
which rage below passion in man, without 
losing the purity of mind which he adores in 
her. She, too, feels a vague regret that some 
portion of his nature is a sealed book to her, 
forever beyond her ken. But her regret is 
nothing to his ; he knows, and she does not. 

My meditations were interrupted suddenly. 
I heard a door stealthily opened. I knew be- 
fore turning that the door was that of Chonita's 
room, the last at the end of the right wing. It 
opened, and she came out. It was as if a face 
alone came out. She was shrouded from head 
to foot in black, and her face was as white as 
the moon. Possessed by a nameless but over- 
whelming fear, I turned the knob of the door 
nearest me and almost fell into the room. I 
closed the door behind me, but there was no 
key. By the strip of white light which entered 
through the crevice between the half-open 
shutters I saw that I was in the room of Valen- 
cia Menendez ; but she slept soundly and had 
not heard me. 

I stood still, listening, for many minutes. 
At first there was no sound ; I evidently had 
startled her, and she was waiting for the house 
to be still again. At last I heard some one 
gliding down the corridor. Then, suddenly, I 
knew that she was coming to this room, and, 
possessed by a horrible curiosity and growing 
terror, I sank on my knees in a corner. 

The door opened noiselessly, and Chonita 
entered. Again I saw only her white face, 
rigid as death, but the eyes flamed with the 
terrible passions that her soul had flung up 

from its depths at last. Then I saw another 
white object, — her hand. But there was no 
knife in it. Had there been, I think I should 
have shaken off the spell which controlled me : 
I never would see murder done. It was the 
awe of the unknown that paralyzed my muscles. 
She bent over Valencia, who moved uneasily 
and cast her arms above her head. I saw her 
touch her finger to the sleeping woman's mouth, 
inserting it between the lips. Then she moved 
backward and stood by the head of the bed, 
facing the window. She raised herself to her 
full height and extended her arms horizontally. 
The position gave her the form of a cross — a 
black cross, topped and pointed with malevolent 
white ; one hand was spread above Valencia's 
face. She was the most awful sight I ever 
beheld. She uttered no sound ; she scarcely 
breathed. Suddenly, with the curve of a pan- 
ther, her figure glided above the unconscious 
woman, her open hand describing a strange 
motion ; then she melted from the room. 

Valencia awoke, shrieking. 

"Some one has cursed me!" she cried. 
" Mother of God ! Some one has cursed me ! " 

I fled from the room, to faint upon my own 
bed. 



XXVI. 

The next morning Casa Grande was thrown 
into consternation. Valencia Menendez was 
in a raging fever, and had to be held in her bed. 

After breakfast I sent for Estenega and told 
him of what I had seen. In the first place I 
had to tell some one, and in the second I 
thought to end his infatuation and avert further
