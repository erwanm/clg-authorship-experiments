thou?" 

"Thou knowest that the Great King with his 
queens and his court are at the palace of Stakhar," 
replied the man. " I go thither from time to time to 
sell cheeses to the slaves. The Great King has made 
a proclamation that whosoever shall bring before him 
Zoroaster shall receive a talent of gold and a robe of 
purple. I am a poor shepherd â€” fearest thou to go 
to the palace ? " 

" I fear nothing. I am past fear these three years." 

" Will the Great King harm thee, thinkest thou ? 
Thou hast paid me well for my pains since I first 
saw thee, and I would not have thee hurt." 

" No man can harm me. My time is not yet come." 

" Wilt thou go with me ? " cried the shepherd, in 
sudden delight. " And shall I have the gold and the 
robe ? " 

" I will go with thee. Thou shalt have all thou 
wouldest," answered Zoroaster. "Art thou ready? 
I have no goods to burden me." 

" But thou art old," objected the shepherd, coming 




 

nearer. " Canst thou go so far on foot ? I have a 
beast; I will return with him in the morning, and 
meet thee upon the height. I came hither in haste, 
being but just returned from Stakhar with the news." 

" I am younger than thou, though my hair is white. 
I will go with thee. Lead the way." 

He stooped and drank of the fountain in the moon- 
light, from the hollow of his hand. Then he turned, 
and began to ascend the steep side of the valley. 
The shepherd led the wa}y in silence, overcome be= 
tween his awe of the man and his delight at his own 
good fortune. 



 



CHAPTER XIV. 

It was now three years since Nehushta had been 
married to Darius, and the king loved her well. But 
often, in that time, he had been away from her, called 
to different parts of the kingdom by the sudden out- 
breaks of revolution which filled the early years of 
his reign. Each time he had come back in triumph, 
and each time he had given her some rich gift. He 
found indeed that he had no easy task to perform 
in keeping the peace between his two queens ; for 
Atossa seemed to delight in annoying Nehushta and 
in making her feel that she was but the second in 
the king's favour, whatever distinctions might be 
offered her. But Darius was just and was careful 
that Atossa should receive her due, neither more nor 
less. 

Nehushta was glad when Zoroaster was gone. She 
had suffered terribly in that moment when he had 
spoken to her out of the crowd, and the winged word 
had made a wound that rankled still. In those three 
years that passed, Atossa never undeceived her con- 
cerning the sight she had seen, and she still believed 
that Zoroaster had basely betrayed her. It was im- 
possible, in her view, that it could be otherwise. 
Had she not seen him herself? Could any man do 
such an action who was not utterly base and heart- 
less ? She had, of course, never spoken to Darius of 



 

the scene upon the terrace. She did not desire the 
destruction of Atossa, nor of her faithless lover. 
Amid all the tender kindness the king lavished upon 
her, the memory of her first love endured still, and 
she could not have suffered the pain of going over 
the whole story again. He was gone, perhaps dead, 
and she would never see him again. He would not 
dare to set foot in the court. She remembered the 
king's furious anger against him, when he suspected 
that the hooded man in the procession was Zoro- 
aster. But Darius had afterwards said, in his usual 
careless way, that he himself would have done as 
much, and that for his oath's sake, he would never 
harm the young Persian. By the grace of Aura- 
mazda he swore, he was the king of kings and did 
not make war upon disappointed lovers ! 

Meanwhile, Darius had built himself a magnificent 
palace, below the fortress of Stakhar, in the valley of 
the Araxes, and there he spent the winter and the 
spring, when the manifold cares of the state would 
permit him. He had been almost unceasingly at war 
with the numerous pretenders who set themselves up 
for petty kings in the provinces. With unheard-of 
rapidity, he moved from one quarter of his dominions 
to another, from east to west, from north to south ; 
but each time that he returned, he found some little 
disturbance going on at the court, and he bent his 
brows and declared that a parcel of women were 
harder to govern than all Media, Persia, and Babylon 
together. 

Atossa wearied him with her suggestions. 

" When the king is gone upon an expedition," she 



 

said, " there is no head in the palace. Otanes is a 
weak man. The king will not give me the control 
of the household, neither will he give it to any one 
else." 

" There is no one whom I can trust," answered 
Darius. " Can you not dwell together in peace for a 
month ? " 

" No," answered Atossa, with her winning smile, " it 
is impossible ; the king's wives will never agree among 
themselves. Let the king choose some one and make 
a head over the palace." 

" Whom shall I choose ? " asked Darius, moodily. 

" The king had a faithful servant once," suggested 
Atossa. 

" Have I none now? " 

" Yea, but none so faithful as this man of whom I 
speak, nor so ready to do the king's bidding. He de- 
parted from Shushan when the king took Nehushta 
to wife " 

"Mean you Zoroaster?" asked Darius, bending his 
brows, and eyeing Atossa somewhat fiercely. But she 
met his glance with indifference. 

" The same," she answered. " Why not send for
