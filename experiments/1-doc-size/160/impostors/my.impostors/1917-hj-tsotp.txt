mystery that Molly herself, from a year ago, 
wrote to you under my approval." 

"He wrote to me under my own," Molly said, 
while her bold eyes, all provoking indulgence, 
suggested to him again in that connection more 
matters than any he immediately grasped. But 
he felt he must try to grasp, having somehow 
got so ridiculously off and away. Of course he 
would have written to her, of course he must and 
with the lapse of another moment he had ex 
pressed this for his relief making the point to 
extravagance in fact, in order to make it at all. 

"I wrote you three to your one, you know 
which I dare say you will have noticed," he ob 
served to her mother, "since I hope she was 
always pleased enough." 

"I grant you, cousin," Perry interposed, "that 
there has gone on here for months past such a 
sight of writing and reading as would have done 
credit to a lawyer's office. I congratulate you 





  

and congratulate them on what it seems to have 
meant." He had spoken in franker accommoda 
tion than had yet come from him, and now walked 
away to the window, where, looking out, he drew 
a deep breath again; Ralph remaining struck 
with his odd alternations, those, as who should 
say, of a man who could lose his ease and fail of 
his balance and then once more recover them 
which was in fact very much what was happening 
to our friend himself. 

"I suppose you've kept my letters, every one 
of which I remember, as I've kept yours," Molly 
resumed in her great gaiety "so that I can 
bring them down to you tied up with pink rib 
bons, and then, if we compare, we'll see who 
wrote oftenest; though of course I quite allow," 
she smiled, "who wrote best." 

Ralph met afresh on this one of his needs to 
consider. "You have 'em tied up with pink 
ribbon?" 

"You mean," Molly asked, "that you've tied 
up mine with blue? Or that you've tied up 
mother's with black?" 

He was conscious, once more, that the truth 
of this would come to him but meanwhile, just 
for the instant, he wondered and waited. "You've 
really got mine to show me?" 

"In return for your showing me mine; which 
look at him, look at him!" she said to her 
mother "I don't half believe you've kept." 





  

He was obliged to hang fire but a moment 
longer it was like that question of her portrait 
in his pocket. He hadn't been sure of that, but 
the miniature was nevertheless there. Her letters 
weren't secreted about his person of course, but 
where would they be else than at the bottom of 
that box at his inn? "If you can prove one of 
them missing," lie was thus in twenty seconds 
ready to answer, "I'll chew the rest of 'em up 
and swallow 'em, red tape and all." 

"Have you tied mine with red tape?" Mrs. 
Midmore asked in full amusement. 

The pleasure of being certain when he could 
be certain was, he rejoiced to note, as great to 
him as ever. "We don't deal in that article as 
much in America, no .doubt, as you do here, but 
one always takes it, you know, for binding 
and if I'm bound with pink ribbon," he said to 
Molly, "I'll have you understand that you re 
tied, my dear, as the lawyers tie up deeds and 
contracts. So that's the way," he laughed, "I 
hold you to your bargain." With which indeed, 
however, he had but to hear the elder lady enrich 
the air with her assurance that their bargain was 
the best witnessed as well as the fairest she had 
ever had to do with, in order to feel anew that 
pinch of conscience, as he could only have called 
it, which he had a few minutes before too in 
sufficiently soothed. He might really have been 
telling lies within these later instants by the 





  

measure, that is, of his recurrent wish to establish 
his innocence of the other recognition. His need 
in this connection withal was to be clearest to 
Mrs. Midmore. "Ten times on the voyage did 
I read them all over, and in fact if she dares to 
doubt of it I'll repeat every word of 'em before 
you and her brother which is a threat, my love, 
that I think will keep you quiet," he gaily con 
tinued to the girl herself. And he had on it an 
extraordinary further inspiration so far as one 
such was more extraordinary than another, and 
so far as what was now before him, for instance, 
was more so than that quick vividness, just re 
corded, of his sense, his positive exact vision, of 
the red-taped packets in the portmanteau. "I 
have them by heart with the funny spelling and 
all; and if our company only hear, without seeing, 
your sweetest passages, my dear, they won't 
know, they won't know !" 

"That I did once write 'affection   with one 
'P, you mean?" Molly broke in with so little 
resentment as to convert into light banter on 
his part a stretch of allusion which he had risked 
with a slight fear of excess. "You'll find also 
when you look again that I once spelled 'fright 
ful' ite I remembered it after my letter had 
gone. And I remember something else too 
which, however, I'll not confess to before them." 

"You confess so charmingly," Ralph returned, 
"that it only makes me love you the more" 





  

for indeed it really touched him that she didn't 
protest with blushes or other missish arts, but 
showed herself, as he might have said, splendidly 
shameless. This after a fashion drew them closer 
still for what was it but the success of his 
pleasantry ? and it struck him that she had at 
no moment yet "told" for so frankly handsome 
as in seeming thus to invite him but to come on 
with what humour he would. This allowed him 
once more all the taste of finding himself right
