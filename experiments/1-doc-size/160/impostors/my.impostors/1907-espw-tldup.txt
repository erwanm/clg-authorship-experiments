phrase. There are certain high-minded adjectives 
not apt to be used except by natures capable of 
that which they represent, and this may be called 
one of them. The sick woman closed her eyes 
before the subject wearily ; and Carolyn crept away. 
In the hall she met her cousin, coming from the 
great blue drawing-room. He looked something 
startled at seeing her where she was, but asked 
no questions. They met and passed with a strong 

 

and silent hand grasp, and the preacher went on, 
and up the stairs. 

" I see that you have no strength to talk. Can 
you put in a few words what it is you wish to say 
to me?" Sterling Hart sat by the elaborate bed, 
and looked with a solemn pity at its occupant. 

" It is about this business of dying," said Mrs. 
Marriot. " You understand the subject ; I do not. 
What is one to do under the circumstances ? " 

" Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, His only 
Son, our Saviour," replied Mr. Hart, devoutly. 

" Oh, I have always been a good churchwoman," 
pleaded Mrs. Marriot. " I never doubted the doc- 
trines. ... Is that all?" 

" No, that is not all. You should repent of your 
sins." 

" My— what?" 

" I said ' your sins.' " 

"Oh, you mean my — indiscretions? My follies, 
I suppose. I admit that I have been imprudent." 

" It is a difference in definition," replied the 
preacher. " You have sent for me. I am a clergy- 
man of the Christian faith. I cannot play with 
words or blunt the facts to you. If you do not wish 
to hear the truth, I can do nothing for you." 

"A dying woman ! You are hard !" 

"No! No! God forbid! Not hard. Only honest, 
only true." 

 

"The follies of a gay life! Every society woman 
makes some mistakes." 

" I do not speak of follies. I do not refer to your 
mistakes. I am talking about your sins. I say you 
must repent of them before you die." 

" I never was spoken to so before," Douce Mar- 
riot whispered, " not in all my life." 

Panting, she tried to struggle up against her 
pillows, but fell back. She looked at the gilded 
loves upon the foot of the bed, and quoted with 
a dreary smile : — 

"What became of them, I wonder, 
When the kissing had to stop ? " 

In the long mirror, between the folds of 
chalk-pale tulle her own shrunken face gazed back at 
her. 

" I am a Protestant priest," replied the preacher, 
kindly. " I have no right to force a confession 
from you. You are an intelligent woman; you can 
deal with God directly." 

"God?" she repeated. "God! What's that? I 
have been interested in other matters. God, — sins, 
— repenting?" She repeated the three words with 
a curious intonation. " It is a foreign language," 
she said, with one of her shrewd smiles. 

Mr. Hart looked across the gilded bed at the 
knights and ladies who rode forever through dead 

 

leaves upon the tapestry. His eyes assumed a 
strange luminosity, as if he saw nothing without 
them, but dwelt on images which came from 
within. 

" If your time is as short as you think," he 
said in a changed voice, " I ought to tell you the 
whole truth, or none of it. I ought to tell you 
the utter truth, or I ought to hold my peace forever." 

" The truth ! " she gasped. " The truth ! I want 
it. I want just that. Tell me what you mean by 
that word ' sin.' I am a reputable woman. I have 
never compromised myself." 

" No," said Sterling Hart, unexpectedly. " You 
have been too prudent to compromise yourself. 
Yourself you have protected. Others you have not 
protected. There are women with ruined reputa- 
tions who are less to blame, in the sight of God, 
than you. You have gone to the very verge of 
evil — as far as you could — without hurling 
yourself down. You have played with the greatest 
danger of a human soul and a human body. You 
have made this the business of your life." 

He was stopped by a low, protesting cry. 

" Let me call your husband, your nurses ! " urged 
the preacher, himself almost as pale as she, with 
the tension of the scene. " You are too weak for 
this. I will stop where I am. I will offer a prayer 

 



for you — if you wish me to — and leave you at 
once. I will not go on." 

But she commanded, "Go on! Go on!" 

"It is all in a few words," he explained. His 
face worked with an infinite compassion, while yet 
it recoiled with an exquisite abhorrence. 

" You have played with the natures — with the 
lower natures — of men as if they had been chil- 
dren's toys. You have broken the hearts of women 
as if they had been shells beneath your feet. You 
have made yourself a drunkard of admiration as a 
man becomes a drunkard of wine. You had the 
gift of beauty, and you degraded it; of charm, and 
you debased it. You have been a light woman. 
This is a sin. The things that you call imprudences 
are sins. Your indiscretions — they are sins. Re- 
pent of them : there is time. Call them by their 
true names — it is too late to call them by any 
other. This is one of the things," added the 
preacher, brokenly, " that Jesus Christ lived and 
died for . . . to understand a position like yours 
... to forgive ... to be gentle ... to overlook, 
to forget, to reinstate you in your own soul . . . 
to restore a precious thing you miss — your self- 
respect." 

Then she cried out upon him, " My self-respect ? 
I lost it so long, so long ago ! If I had my life to
