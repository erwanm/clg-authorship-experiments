Meanwhile what of Theo and Mr. Ross? He still came. 
Sometimes Theo wore her ring, but she was oftener with- 
out. Now and then she broke out into a tempest of gayety 
and flirtation, then she was demure as a nun. Mr. Ross 
was so patient, so generous, that I began to feel sorry for 
him when Theo was in her wilful moods. One evening he 
tried to restrain her a little, and incidental referred to 
something he could or would do, with an air of authority. 

‘ ‘ I will tell you what you can do ; ” and Theo gave a 
light, bitter laugh. “You can leave the house, and never 
come into it again. You worry my life out with your love 
and your care, and every thing. It stifles me ; it kills me ! 
A lifetime of it would set me cmzy. Go! ” And she 
stamped her foot, while her eyes fairly blazed. 

He rose slowly, said good-evening in the quietest of 
tones, and went out. 





“There, it is all over! Chris, am I a termagant, a 
sharp, ungrateful vixen? Why do people love and care 
for me? When they stay at a distance, I like them pretty 
well : when they come near — well, sometimes I hate them ; 
yes, I really do. Was there ever an instance, think, of 
one being born an old maid from the very beginning ? I 
must have been, I believe. But isn’t it queer how quick 
he took it, how he marched olf in high disdain I Was he 
very angry, I wonder? ” And her voice began to fall a 
little from its shrill key, and take on a tremulous quiver. 
“ Do you suppose he loves me very much Chris? I hope 
not. If he only would take to some one else ! ” 

Then she threw herself on the sofa, buried her face in 
the pillow, and sobbed softly

‘ ‘ O Theo ! ’ ’ Could I comfort her ? Did she love him ? 
“ I am glad it is all at an end,” she began presently. 
“ I shall never have another lover, Chris, never. And 
now I am going to turn over a new leaf. I mean to prac- 
tise my music, and see if I cannot get a few scholars. 
The discipline will be good, and the money will be better. 
I can’t consent to be the only drone in the hive, when you 
and Della are working so industriously.” 

“ Why, you do work,” I replied energetically. “ See 
what you save me in hats and dresses, and how much 
you help mother ! One pair of hands could not do all the 
work of this family.” 

“ I am glad you think me of some use, Chris. If I 
should — well,” with a kind of hysterical laugh, — “if 
I should marry, and go away with some one, I hope you 
would miss me a little. I should like to think that some 
one said, ‘ Dear Theo’s fingers did this or that, or she 
said thus and so.’ I cannot bear the idea of being quite 
forgotten. I wonder if an}- one would ever be foolish 
enough to — to kiss a little ribbon, for instance, that some 
other body had worn, and tied in a cunning little bow, 
or to read over the poems one had loved, when that one 
was miles and miles away? ” 


 


“ How queer you are talking, Theo, for a girl who 
does not intend to marry ! 

“ Oh, yes ! ” in a kind of absent way, her eyes seeming 
to look into the future. ‘‘ I am queer and flighty. Next 
thing I’ll be having spells, like Mrs. Sandborn.” 

Mrs. Sandborn still indulged in her periodical “mys- 
teries.” Mr. Sandborn had been drafted, and did really 
want to go to war : indeed, would have enlisted at first, 
if she had not “gone on” so terribly. When she heard 
of the result of the draft, she just passed from one swoon 
to another, called in the neighbors and several doctors, 
and lay at the point of death, until her husband promised 
to get a substitute. Having no ready money, he was 
compelled to mortgage his house ; but his whole heart 
went out to the brave men who were struggling for their 
country’s weal. 

Afterward I came to know that it was not the chanse 
and absence of marriage that was in Theo’s mind this 
evening. 

“ The best thing, Theo, is to go to bed, and get a little 
tranquillized,” I replied: so we shut up the parlor, and 
betook ourselves to our room. 

Why was Theo so different from most girls? for she 
was, as I well understood. I began to envy real com- 
monplace people, and wish somehow that she — no, I 
didn’t want her changed, either. If only — ah, how 
much of anxious desire those two words may comprehend ! 

We went to bed. I was healthily and unromantically 
sleepy. Theo lay very quiet, save that I could hear her 
heart beat, as if it were under my very pillow. 

“What is the matter, dear?” I asked presently. 
“ Are you unhappy? ” 

“My darling!” She turned, and kissed me in the 
dark. “ No, I am not unhappy. I ought to have some 
compunctions of conscience ; ” and she gives the old, gay, 
mischievous laugh, by which I knew her sweet temper is 





quite restored. “But if one could learn in some way, 
Chris, just what God meant to have one do. It puzzles 
me so. There must be some design in it all. When so 
many things point in one direction, it seems as if the way 
was plain ; but is it the right way? Can one judge simply 
from the personal desire ? Some one said ‘ Duty was the 
thing that you did not want to do, but that was put 
straight in your way.’ Is it, I wonder? ” 

“ I do not think it means marriage, Theo.” 

“Yet how many women would, if they had listened to 
the promptings of their hearts, have married unworthily 
and wrongly ! You pray to be shown a way, and, if one 
opens before you, how decide that it is of God? ” 

“I do not know how we can be sure.” 

I said this solemnly, and in no cavilling frame of mind. 
Is it that the mistakes are given to us also, not that we 
went into them by fault, or shortsightedness, but that the 
discipline was simply the living out of them ? 

“ Pray that I may be right, Chris. The rest I shall 
not trouble about.” 

“ You were right, Theo, to give him up. I do not 
believe you would have been really happy with him.” 

She was not looking at it in this view ; but I did not 
know then. 

Is there some fatal strength in circumstances ? and must 
one go on straight in the path of destiny ? These questions 
confuse and stagger me. 

We were at dinner the next day, when aunt Hetty came 
in. Some friend of hers, quite out in the suburbs, had 
been buried that morning ; “ and though she could just as 
well have ridden clear home in the coach,” she thought 
she would stop. “We girls had grown so grand since
