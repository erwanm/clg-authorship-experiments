"Yes, child; I begin to realize that this is no 
sort of life for you." He studied her with secret 
sympathy. 

" No, it isn't, Roy." She came and snuggled in 



 

his lap like a kitten. " Could not we let some one 
take the house and go up in town to board ? " 

" It would be very inconvenient, you see. Sam 
is needed here on the farm, and over to the mill, 
and in half a dozen places at once, it seems to me; 
and there would not be any room for boarders if 
the men came." 

" I'm just miserable, Roy. I don't have any 
pleasure." 

"There's the piano, and the pony carriage," 

" Do you suppose I want to play everlastingly 
to myself ? And if a friend would go driving with 
me but I don't want the old frumps and some 
one with a sick baby. I hate charity work ! " 

He looked down at the baby face, drawn with 
pettishness. The soft golden hair was in pretty 
disorder, the mouth was red and pleading in 
spite of the frown. He bent over and kissed 
her. 

" Bessie," he said regretfully, " I ought not to 
have married you. I am worlds too old for you 
not in years exactly, but in most things. Then I 
am a busy man and care so little for parties." 

It seemed to him he had grown much more 
serious since Aunt Hannah's death. She had 
been so brisk and alert with commonplace cheer 
fulness. 

"Well, why did you?" Bessie cried wilfully. 


" I thought you loved me. And it seemed the 
best thing to do then." 

" But you are so different. You were always 
bright and full of talk and plans last summer, 
and taking Miss Otis out to every pretty place, 
as if you were in love with her. I do believe you 
were, a little. She tried hard enough to make 
you." 

" Bessie ! " His voice was unconsciously stern. 
" Do you not remember they were paying for the 
drives and the attention ? I take the railroad 
directors out, the mill proprietors. I even point 
out advantages to them." His tone was a little 
dry and harsh. "And as for Miss Otis I dare 
say she has forgotten about Westhorpe and all of 
us." 

" But she did like you, and she tried to keep 
you from caring about me. She was always put 
ting high ideas in your mind, and you were so 
much nicer without them. Not that she would 
have married you " 

" No, she would not have married me," taking 
up Bessie's sentence quickly. " Such a thought 
never entered her mind, nor mine. She belongs 
to a different world, to a world of culture and 
refinement. So we can dismiss her." 

" But you did like her. You took more trouble 
for her than you do for me. Why do you 




not drive out with me on pleasant afternoons ? 
Oh, if people would only come in and play and 
sing and talk ! It's so stupid ! " 

She gave a little stretch and yawn that deepened 
her expression of dissatisfaction, her indifference. 
He felt it in every pulse of his being. She was 
a soft little bundle, and he could feel her pulses 
beating gently as if she had not been deeply 
moved, but just a little fretted. He remembered 
the night a year ago he had brought her in his 
arms and placed her in the old chair over yonder, 
to Aunt Hannah's great disgust. She had stirred 
all his pity and sympathy then and many a time 
since. But he knew when he married her that he 
did not love her as it was possible for him to love. 
He did believe he would grow to love her 
through her very fondness for him. But he 
understood, now, that her nature had no depth, no 
real affection, though she could be jealous enough. 
He was not yet thirty. There was before him ten 
of the most ardent years of a man's life. Perhaps 
at forty love would cease to exert such a sway, 
such a longing. He could honestly say that he 
had tried at first to awaken a deeper regard. 
There had been very little real love-making, the 
silly fondness he despised. Must all their years 
pass like this ? 

He made no moan that he had so thrown away 


his life. Not to have done it would have exposed 
Bessie to gossip. But what could he do for her if 
she would not be lifted up by his love ? 

"Bessie" his voice had a strange solemnity 
in it "we have not done so very well so far. 
It has been a great mistake. But other people 
have outlived mistakes and come to a true under 
standing. Can't we begin again ? If you would 
try a little ! You are so young. There are many 
things for you to learn. I will help you to the 
best of my ability 

" I hate preaching ! " and Bessie sat up with 
a touch of resolution, " and I wish I wasn't mar 
ried. I'd like to have years of good times. But 
one can't have them without money. Thirza 
Rolfe and some other women keep house and do 
quite as they like, and there's so much going on 
in a great city. Roy, people do get divorced 

" Bessie ! " The sternness of his face and voice 
frightened her, and dropping her head on his 
breast she began to cry. 

" My dear Bessie, we must try how near to 
gether we can bring our lives. We must remem 
ber what we have promised each other first of 
all, to love. And we both said of our own free 
will ' till death do us part.' " 

He felt her shudder at the mention of death. 

" Bessie, shall we try ? " 



 

"You're awfully good, Roy." She reached up 
and kissed .him. " And now I am going to bed, 
and you can go back to your books."
