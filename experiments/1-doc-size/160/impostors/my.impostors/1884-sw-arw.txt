rest went, but she went making silent protest. 

" You do not care for the poets, Miss Betty," remarked Mr. Dallas jocosely. 

" I see here very few names of poets that I care 
about," she responded. " To judge by the rest, I 
should say it was about as much of an honour to 
be left out of Westminster Abbey as to be put in." 

" Fie, fie, Miss Betty ! what heresy is here ! 
Westminster Abbey? why it is the one last desire 
of ambition." 

" I am beginning to think ambition is rather an 
empty thing, sir." 

" See, here is Butler. Don't you read Hudibras?" 

" No, sir." 

"You should. It's very clever. Then here is 



 

Spenser, next to him. You are devoted to the 
Faerie Queene, of course ! " 

" I never read it." 

" You might do worse," remarked Pitt, who was 
just before them with his mother. 

"Does anybody read Spenser now?" 

" It is a poor sign for the world if they do not." 

" One cannot read everything," said Betty. " I 
read Shakspeare; I am glad to see his monument." 

It was a relief to pass on at last from the crowd 
of literary folk into the nobler parts of the Abbey; 
and yet, as the impression of its wonderful beauty 
and solemn majesty first fully came upon Miss 
Frere, it was oddly accompanied by an instant 
jealous pang. * He will bring somebody else here 
some day, who will come as often as she likes; 
be at home here; and enjoy the Abbey as if it 
were her own property." And Betty wished she 
had never come; and in the same inconsistent 
breath was exceedingly rejoiced that she had come. 
Yes, she would take all of the beauty in that she 
could; take it and keep it in her memory for ever; 
taste it while she had it, and live on the after taste 
for the rest of her life. But the taste of it was at 
the moment sharp with pain. 

Pitt had procured from one of the canons who 
had been his uncle's friend, an order which permitted them to go their own way and take their 
own time, unaccompanied and untrammelled by 
vergers. No showman was necessary in Pitt's presence; he could tell them all, and much more than 





they cared about knowing. Mrs. Dallas indeed 
cared for little beyond the tokens of England's antiquity and glory; her interest was mostly expended 
on the royal tombs and thoss connected with them. 
For was riot Pitt now, virtually, one of the favoured 
nation? by habit and connection as well as in 
blood ? and did not England's greatness send down 
a reflected light on all her sons? only poetical 
justice, as it was earlier sons who had made the 
greatness. But of that Mrs. Dallas did not think. 
" England " was an abstract idea of majesty and 
power, embodied in a land and a government; and 
Westminster Abbey was in a sort the record and 
visible token of the same, and testimony of it, in 
the face of all the world. So Mrs. Dallas enjoyed 
Westminster Abbey, and her heart swelled in contemplation of its glories; but its real glories she 
saw not. Lights and shadows, colouring, forms of 
beauty, associations of tenderness, majesties of age, 
had ail no existence for her. The one feeling in 
exercise, which took its nourishment from all she 
looked upon, was pride. But pride is a dull kind of 
gratification; and the good lady's progress through 
the Abbey could not be called satisfactory to one 
who knew the place. 

Mr. Dallas was neither proud nor pleased. He 
was however an Englishman, and Westminster 
Abbey was intensely English, and to go through 
and look at it was the right thing to do; so he 
went; doing his duty. 

And beside these two went another bit of humnanity, all alive and quivering, intensely sensitive 
to every impression, which must needs be more or 
less an impression of suffering. Her folly, she told 
herself, it was which had so stripped her of her natural 
defences and exposed her to suffering. The one 
only comfort left was, that nobody knew it; and 
nobody should know it. The practice of society 
had given her command over herself, and she exerted 
it that day; all she had. 

They were making the tour of St. Edmund's 
chapel. 

" Look here, Betty," cried Mrs. Dallas, who was 
still a little apart from the others with her son, 
"come here and see this! Look here the tomb 
of two little children of Edward the Third!" 

"After going over some of the other records, 
ma 'am,.! can but call them happy to have died little." 

"But isn't it interesting? Pitt tells me there 
were six of the little princess's brothers and sisters 
that stood here at her funeral, the Black Prince 
among them. Just think of it! Around this tomb!" 

" Why should it be more interesting to us than 
any similar gathering of common people ? There 
is many a spot in country graveyards at home 
where more than six members of a family have 
stood together." 

" But my dear ! These were Edward the Third's 
children." 

"Yes. He was something when he was alive; 
but what is he to us now? And why should we 
care," Betty hastily went on to generalities, seeing 





the astonishment in Mrs. Dallas's face, " why 
should we be more interested in the monuments 
and deaths of the great, than in those of lesser 
people? In death and bereavement all come down 
to a common humanity." 

" Not a common humanity ! " said Mrs. Dallas, 
rather staring at Betty. 

"All are alike on the other side, mother," observed 
Pitt. " The king's daughter and the little village 
girl stand on the same footing, when once they 
have left this state of things. There is only one 
nobility that can make any difference then." 

" One nobility " repeated Mrs. Dallas, bewildered. 

" You remember the words * Whosoever shall 
do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the 
same is my mother, and my sister, and brother. The
