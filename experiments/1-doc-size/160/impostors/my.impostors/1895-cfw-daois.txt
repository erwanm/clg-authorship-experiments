"Not at all; I ask only the simple and retiring womanly graces. But
anything retiring was hard to find in the eighteenth century."

"You dislike literary women very much," said Mrs. Winthrop. She had
crossed the room to examine an old mirror made of squares of glass,
welded together by little leaden frames, which had once been gilded.

"Hardly. I pity them."

"You did not know, then, that I was one?"

He had crossed the room also, and was now standing behind her; as she
asked the question she looked at his image in the glass.

"I did not know it," he answered, looking at hers.

"I am, anonymously."

"Better anonymously than avowedly."

"Will you read something I have written?"

"Thanks. I am not in the least a critic."

"I know that; you are too prejudiced, too narrow, to be one. All the
same, will you read?"

"If you insist."

"I do insist. What is more, I have it with me. I have had it for several
days, waiting for a good opportunity." She drew from her pocket a small
flat package, and gave it to him.

"Must it be now?"

"Here and now. Where could we find a more appropriate atmosphere?"

He seated himself and opened the parcel; within was a small square book
in flexible covers, in decoration paper and type, a daintily rich little
volume.

"Ah! I know this," he said. "I read it when it first came out."

"So much the better. You can give me your opinion without the trouble of
reading."

"It received a good deal of praise, I remember," he said, turning over
the leaves.

She was silent.

"There was a charming little description somewhere--about going out on
the Campagna to gather the wild narcissus," he went on, after a pause.

And then there was another silence.

"But--" said Mrs. Winthrop.

"But, as you kindly suggest, I am no judge of poetry. I can say nothing
of value."

"Say it, valuable or not. Do you know, Mr. Ford, that you have scarcely
spoken one really truthful word to me since we first met. Yet I feel
sure that it does not come natural to you, and that it has cost you some
trouble to--to--"

"To decorate, as I have, my plain speech. But if that is true, is it not
a compliment?"

"And do I care for your compliments? I have compliments in abundance,
and much finer ones than yours. What I want from you is the truth, your
real opinion of that little volume in your hand. You are the only man I
have met in years who seems to feel no desire to flatter me, to make me
think well of myself. I see no reason why I should not think well of
myself; but, all the same, I am curious. I can see that you judge me
impartially, even severely."

She paused. He did not look up or disclaim; he went on turning the pages
of the little volume.

She had not seated herself; she was standing beside a table opposite
him. "I can see that you do not in the least like me," she added, in a
lower tone.

"My dear lady, you have so many to like you!" said Ford.

And then he did look up; their eyes met.

A flush came to her cheeks. He shut the little book and rose.

"Really, I am too insignificant a victim," he said, bowing as he
returned it.

"You mean that I--that I have tried--"

"Oh no; you do it naturally."

For the moment her self-possession had failed her. But now she had it in
hand again. "If I have tried, naturally or artificially, I have made a
failure--have I not?"

"It must be a novel experience for Mrs. Winthrop."

She turned away and looked at a portrait of Voltaire. After some
moments, "Let us come back to the real point between us," she said, as
he did not speak--"that is, your opinion of my little book."

"Is that the real point between us?"

"Of course it is. We will walk up and down Corinne's old rooms, and you
shall tell me as we walk."

"Why do you force me to say unpleasant things?"

"They are unpleasant, then? I knew it! Unpleasant for me."

"For us both."

"For you, I doubt it. For me, they cannot be more unpleasant than the
things you have already said. Yet you see I forgive them."

"Yes; but I have not forgiven you, Mrs. Winthrop."

"For what, pray?"

"For proposing to make me a victim."

"Apparently you had small difficulty in escaping."

"As you say--apparently. But perhaps I conceal my wounds."

"You are trying to turn the subject, so that I will not insist about the
little book."

"I wish, indeed, that you would not insist."

"But if I am the sort of woman you have indicated, I should think you
would enjoy punishing me a little."

"A little, perhaps. But the punishment would be too severe."

They were walking slowly through the rooms; she turned her head and
looked at him. "I have listened to you, Mr. Ford; I have let you say
pretty much what you pleased to me, because it was amusing. But you
cannot seriously believe that I really care for what you say, severe or
otherwise?"

"Only as any right-minded woman must care."

"Say on. Now I insist."

"Good-bye to Miolans, then. You will never admit me within its gates
again; that is, unless you have the unusual justice--unusual in a
woman--to see that what I say is but the severity of a true friend."

"A friend is not severe."

"Yes, he is; in such a case as this, must be."
