At this there was a great shout that rang up to 
the vault of the lofty vestibule, and down the stone 
steps and out into the courtyard. Eleanor smiled 
serenely, for she laiew her men. 

" Go with me, then," she said, " and see that no 
bodily harm comes to me. But in this matter I shall 
do the King's will." 

In the room behind, the words echoed clearly, and 
Beatrix turned to Gilbert. 

"You see," she said, "it is but a play that you 
have thought of between you, and nothing more." 

"Can you not believe us? "he asked reproachfully. 

" I shall believe you when I know that you love 
me," she answered, and turned away, towards the 
door of the inner apartments. 

Gilbert followed her. 

" Beatrix ! " he cried. " Beatrix I Hear me ! " 

She turned once more, with a face like stone. 

"I have heard you, I have heard her, and I do 
not believe you," she answered. 

Without another word she left him and went out. 
He stood looking after her for a moment, while his 
calm face darkened slowly ; and his anger was slow 
and lasting, as the heating of a furnace for the smelt- 
ing. He stooped and picked up his cap, which had 
fallen to the floor, and then he, too, followed the 
Queen, through the vestibule and stairs and court- 
yard, to the King's presence. 

That niglit they left hastily and went down to 
the sea with torches ; but it was dawn when they 
were on board one of the great ships, and the hawsers 
were cast off, and the crew began to heave up 
the anchor. In his anger, Gilbert had called his men, 
and had gone on board also, and many hours passed 
before he realized what he had done. Then he began to torment himself. 

His angry manhood told him that he was just 
and that he should not bear a girl's unbelief when 
he was manifestly in the right ; and his love an- 
swered that he had left Beatrix without protection 
and perhaps at the mercy of her father, since he might 
come by sea at any moment and claim her from 
Count Raymond, who would give her up without 
opposition. He wondered also why Sir Arnold had 
not appeared, and whether, having sailed from 
Ephesus, he had been shipwrecked. But his thoughts 
soon turned back to his work, and he sat on the low 
rail by the main-rigging, looking down at the blue 
water as the ship ran smoothly along. What was 
there in Beatrix to hold him, after all? It was 
nothing but a boyish memory, revived by a mis- 
taken idea of faith. 

But suddenly he felt within him the aching hollow 
and the grinding hunger of heart that the loved 





 

woman leaves behind her, and. he knew well that his 
anger was playing a comedy with him, as Beatrix 
had accused him and the Queen of playing a play in 
the past night. 

It was hard that she should not have believed 
him ; and yet when one has seen and heard, it is 
harder still to believe against sight and hearing. If 
she had loved him, he said to himself, she could not 
have doubted him. He would never have doubted 
her, no matter what he might have seen her do. But 
at this he began to realize and understand ; for in 
order to persuade himself, he pictured her sitting as 
the Queen had sat, and a man bending over her and 
kissing her and calling her the love of his life and 
heart, and he felt another sort of anger rising fiercely 
in him, because the imagined sight was vivid and 
bad to see. Thereupon he grew calmer, seeing that 
she was not wholly wrong, and he began to curse his 
evil fate and to wish that he had not followed the 
Queen, but had stayed behind at Antioch. 

But it was too late now, for Antioch was gone in 
the purple distance, and it was towards evening. 

The day dawned again, and darkened, and days 
after that, while he perpetually blamed himself more 
and more and began to find a fault in every doing of 
his life, and the gloom of the northern temper settled 
upon him and oppressed him heavily, so that his 
companions wondered what had happened to him. 

During all that time the Queen never showed her- 
self, but remained in her cabin with the Lady Anne, 
who had come with her and would not be denied. 
For Eleanor hated to see the King, and she was 





afraid to see Gilbert, whom she knew to be in the 
ship's company, and she was very sad, also, and 
cared not for the daylight nor for men's voices. It 
made it worse that she had tried to sacrifice herself 
for the woman Gilbert loved, since it had been in 
vain, and she had not been believed, and since he had 
after all come vnth her, she knew not why. As for the 
King, he sat all day long on the quarter-deck under 
an awning, telling beads, and praying fervently that 
the presence of the woman of Belial might not dis- 
tract his thoughts when he should at last come to 
the holy places ; for before anything else he con- 
sidered his own soul as of great importance. 

So they came to Ptolemais, which some called 
Acre, and they rode a weary way to Jerusalem, till 
the young King Baldwin of Jerusalem, the third of 
that name, came out to meet them with a very rich 
train. Then Gilbert lagged behind, for he had no 
heart in any rejoicing or feasting, seeing that he 
should not have been there at all, and had left 
Beatrix in anger. But Eleanor had come out of the 
ship to the shore, more beautiful than ever, and 
serenely scornful of the King, since he had not even 
dared to use the power she had put into his hands, 
in order to tell her his mind, and speak out his 
reproaches ; and he was more ridiculous than ever in 
her eyes. From that time she paid no more attention 
to him than if he had not existed, for she despised a 
man who would not use the power he had. 

As for Gilbert, though he was in such melancholy 
mood, when he saw the walls and towers of Jeru- 
salem at last, a hope of peace sprang up in him, 



 

and a certainty of satisfaction not like anything which 
he had known before ; and it seemed to him that if 
he could but be alone in the holy places he should 
find rest for his soul. Therefore he rode in the rear 
of the train, though he was a man of consequence, 
and many young knights and squires looked up to
