a good ancestor to my descendants," Plank would say 
laughingly. " They shall have a chance, every one of 
them. And it will be up to them if they don't make 
good." 

Sipping their tea in the pleasant, sunny room, they 
discussed matters of common interest — Plank's recent 
fishing trip on Long Island and the degeneracy of liver- 
fed trout ; the North Side Club's Experiments with Euro- 
pean partridges ; Bilh Fleetwood's new stables ; forestry, 
and the chance of national legislation concerning it — 
a subject of which Plank was very fond, and on w hich 
he had exceedingly sound ideas. 

Drifting from one topic to another through the haze 
of their cigars, silent when it pleased them to be so, 
there could be no doubt of their liking for each other 
upon a basis at least superficially informal; and if 
Plank's manner retained at times a shade of quaint re- 
serve, Siward's was perhaps the more frankly direct for 
that reason. 

" I think," observed Plank, laying his half-consumed 
cigar on the silver tray, " that I'd better go down town 
and see what our pre-glacial friend Quarrier wants. I 
may be able to furnish him with a new sensation." 

" I wonder if Quarrier ever experienced a genuine 
sensation," mused Siward, arranging the papers before 
him into divisional piles. 

"Plenty," said Plank drily. 

" I don't think so." 

" Plenty," repeated Plank. " It's your thin-lipped, 
thin-nosed, pasty-pale, symmetrical brother who is closer 
to the animal under his mask than any of us imagine. 
I — " He hesitated. " Do you want to know my opin- 
ion of Quarrier? I've never told you. I don't usually 
talk about my — dislikes. Do you want to know.'' " 





 



" Certainly," said Siward curiously. 

" Then, first of all, he is a sentimentalist." 

" Oh ! oh! " jeered Siward. 

" A sentinientaHst of the weakest type," continued 
Plank obstinately ; " because he sentimentalises over him- 
self. Siward, look out for the man with elaborate whis- 
kers ! Look out for a pallid man with eccentric hair 
and a silky beard ! He's a sentimentalist of the sort 
I told you, and is usually utterly remorseless in 
his dealings with women. I suppose you think me a 
fool." 

" I think Quarrier is indifferent concerning women," 
said Siward. 

" You are wrong. He is a sensualist," insisted 
Plank. 

" Oh, no, Plank— not that ! " 

" A sensualist. His sentimental vanity he lavishes 
upon himself — the animal in him on women. His cau- 
tion, born of self-consideration, is the caution of a 
beast. Such men as he believe they live in the focus 
of a million eyes. Part of his vanity is to deceive those 
eyes and be what he is under the mask he wears ; and 
to do that one must be the very master of caution. 
That is Quarrier's vanity. To conceal, is his mono- 
mania." 

" I cannot see how you draw that conclusion." 

" Siward, he is a bad man, and crafty — every inch 
of him." 

" Oh, come, now ! Only characters in fiction have 
no saving qualities. You never heard of anybody in real 
life being entireW bad." 

" No, I didn't ; and Quarrier isn't. For example, 
he is kind to valuable animals — I mean, his own." 

" Good to animals ! The bad man's invariable char- 




 



acteristic ! " laughed Siward. " I'm kind to 'em, too. 
What else is he good to ? " 

" Everybody knows that he hasn't a poor relation 
left; not one. He is loyal to them in a rare way; he 
filled one subsidiary company full of them. It is known 
down town as the ' Home for Destitute Nephews.' " 

" Seriously, Plank, the man must have something 
good in him." 

" Because of your theory ? " 

" Yes. I believe that nobody is entirely bad. So do 
the great masters of fiction." 

Plank said gravely : " He is a good son to his father. 
That is perfectly true — kind, considerate, dutiful, loyal. 
The financial world is perfectly aware that Stanley 
Quarrier is to-day the most unscrupulous old scoundrel 
who ever crushed a refinery or debauched a railroad! 
and his son no more believes it than he credits the 
scandalous history of the Red Woman of Wall Street. 
Why, when I was making arrangements for that chapel 
Quarrier came to me, very much perturbed, because he 
understood that all the memorial chapels for the cathe- 
dral had been arranged for, and he had desired to build 
one to the memory of his father! His father \ Isn't 
it awful to think of! — a chapel to the memory of the 
briber of judges and of legislatures, the cynical defier 
of law ! — this hoary old thief, who beggared the widow 
and stripped the orphan, and whose only match, as a 
great unpunished criminal, was that sinister little pre- 
decessor of his, who dreamed even of debauching the 
executive of these United States ! " 

Siward had never before seen Plank aroused, and he 
said so, smiling. 

" That is true," said Plank earnestly ; " I waste little 
temper over my likes and dislikes. But what I. know, 





 



and what I legitimately infer concerning the younger 
Quarrier is enough to rouse any man's anger. I won't 
tell you what I know. I can't. It has nothing to do 
with his financial methods, nothing to do with this busi- 
ness; but it is bad — bad all through! The blow his
