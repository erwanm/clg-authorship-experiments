himself. Rodman lighted a match ; there was no candle, 
only a piece of pitch-pine stuck in an iron socket on the 
wall ; he set fire to this primitive torch and looked around. 

" There is nothing there," said the man outside, making 
an effort to speak carelessly ; " my servant went to town for 
supplies. Do not trouble yourself to wait ; he will come pres 
ently, and and I want nothing." 

But Rodman saw through proud poverty's lie ; he knew 
that irregular quavering of the voice, and that trembling of 
the hand ; the poor fellow had but one to tremble. He con 
tinued his search ; but the bare room gave back nothing, not 
a crumb. 

" Well, if you are not hungry," he said, briskly, " I am, 
hungry as a bear; and I'll tell you what I am going to do. I 
live not far from here, and I live all alone too ; I haven't a 
servant as you have. Let me take supper here with you, just 
for a change ; and, if your servant comes, so much the better, 
he can wait upon us. I'll run over and bring back the 
things." 

He was gone without waiting for reply; the shattered 
ankle made good time over the waste, and soon returned, 
limping a little, but bravely hasting, while on a tray came the 
keeper's best supplies, Irish potatoes, corned beef, wheaten 
bread, butter, and coffee ; for he would not eat the hot bis 
cuits, the corn-cake, the bacon and hominy of the country, 
and constantly made little New England meals for himself in 
his prejudiced little kitchen. The pine-torch flared in the 
doorway; a breeze had come down from the far mountains 
and cooled the air. Rodman kindled a fire on the cavernous 
hearth, filled the kettle, found a saucepan, and commenced 
operations, while the other lay outside and watched every 
movement in the lighted room. 

" All ready ; let me help you in. Here we are now ; fried 
potatoes, cold beef, mustard, toast, butter, and tea. Eat, 
man ; and the next time I am laid up you shall come over and 
cook for me." 


Hunger conquered, and the other ate, ate as he had not 
eaten for months. As he was finishing a second cup of tea, 
a slow step came around the house ; it was the missing Pomp, 
an old negro, bent and shriveled, who carried a bag of meal 
and some bacon in his basket. " That is what they live on," 
thought the keeper. 

He took leave without more words. " I suppose now I 
can be allowed to go home in peace," he grumbled to con 
science. The negro followed him across what was once the 
lawn. " Fin Mars Ward mighty low," he said apologeti 
cally, as he swung open the gate which still hung between its 
posts, although the fence was down, " but I hurred and hurred 
as fas as I could ; it's mighty fur to de town. Proud to see 
you, sah ; hope you'll come again. Fine fambly, de Wards, 
sah, befo de war." 

" How long has he been in this state ? " asked the keeper. 

" Ever sence one ob de las battles, sah ; but he's worse 
sence we come yer, bout a mont back." 

" Who owns the house ? Is there no one to see to him ? 
has he no friends ? " 

" House b long to Mars Ward's uncle ; fine place once, 
befo de war ; he's dead now, and dah's nobuddy but Miss 
Bettina, an she's gone off somewhuz. Propah place, sah, fur 
Mars Ward own uncle's house," said the old slave, loyally 
striving to maintain the family dignity even then. 

" Are there no better rooms no furniture ? " 

" Sartin ; but but Miss Bettina, she took de keys ; she 
didn't know we was comin " 

" You had better send for Miss Bettina, I think," said the 
keeper, starting homeward with his tray, washing his hands, 
as it were, of any future responsibility in the affair. 

The next day he worked in his garden, for clouds veiled 
the sun and exercise was possible ; but, nevertheless, he could 
not forget the white face on the old rug. " Pshaw ! " he said 
to himself, " haven't I seen tumble-down old houses and bat 
tered human beings before this ? " 


At evening came a violent thunderstorm, and the splendor 
of the heavens was terrible. " We have chained you, 
mighty spirit," thought the keeper as he watched the light 
ning, " and some time we shall learn the laws of the winds 
and foretell the storms ; then, prayers will no more be offered 
in churches to alter the weather than they would be offered 
now to alter an eclipse. Yet back of the lightning and the 
wind lies the power of the great Creator, just the same." 

But still into his musings crept, with shadowy persistence, 
the white face on the rug. 

" Nonsense ! " he exclaimed ; " if white faces are going 
around as ghosts, how about the fourteen thousand white 
faces that went under the sod down yonder ? If they could 
arise and walk, the whole State would be filled and no more 
carpet-baggers needed." So, having balanced the one with 
the fourteen thousand, he went to bed. 

Daylight brought rain still, soft, gray rain; the next 
morning showed the same, and the third likewise, the nights 
keeping up their part with low-down clouds and steady pat 
tering on the roof. " If there was a river here, we should 
have a flood," thought the keeper, drumming idly on his win 
dow-pane. Memory brought back the steep New England 
hillsides shedding their rain into the brooks, which grew in a 
night to torrents and filled the rivers so that they overflowed 
their banks ; then, suddenly, an old house in a sunken corner 
of a waste rose before his eyes, and he seemed to see the rain 
dropping from a moldy ceiling on the straw where a white 
face lay. 

" Really, I have nothing else to do to-day, you know," he 
remarked in an apologetic way to himself, as he and his um 
brella went along the old road ; and he repeated the remark 
as he entered the room where the man lay, just as he had fan 
cied, on the damp straw. 

" The weather is unpleasant," said the man. " Pomp, 
bring a chair." 

Pomp brought one, the only one, and the visitor sat down. 
A fire smoldered on the hearth and puffed out acrid smoke 
now and then, as if the rain had clogged the soot in the long- 
neglected chimney ; from the streaked ceiling oozing drops 
fell with a dull splash into little pools on the decayed floor ; the 
door would not close ; the broken panes were stopped with 
rags, as if the old sen-ant had tried to keep out the damp ; in 
the ashes a corn-cake was baking. 

" I am afraid you have not been so well during these long 
rainy days," said the keeper, scanning the face on the straw. 

"My old enemy, rheumatism," answered the man; "the 
first sunshine will drive it away." 

They talked awhile, or rather the keeper talked, for the 
other seemed hardly able to speak, as the waves of pain 
swept over him ; then the visitor went outside and called 
Pomp out. "Is there any one to help him, or not?" he 
asked impatiently. 

" Fine fambly, befo de war," began Pomp. 

" Never mind all that ; is there any one to help him now 
yes or no ? "
