boy on my knee ; I felt as though I should never move or 
speak again. But after the army came the army-followers 
and stragglers, carrion-birds who flew behind the conquerors 
and devoured what they had left. They swept the town clean 
of food and raiment ; many houses they wantonly burned ; 
what they could not carry with them they destroyed. My 
own home did not escape : rude men ransacked every closet 
and drawer, and cut in ribbons the old portraits on the wall. 
A German, coming in from the smoke-house, dripping with 
bacon-juice, wiped his hands upon my wedding-veil, which 
had been discovered and taken from its box by a former in 
truder. It was a little thing ; but, oh, how it hurt me ! At 
length the last straggler left us, and we remained in the ashes. 
We could not sit down and weep for ourselves and for our 
dead ; the care of finding wherewithal to eat thrust its coarse 
necessity upon us, and forced us to our feet. I had thought 
that all the rest of my life would be but a bowed figure at the 
door of a sepulchre ; but the camp-followers came by, took 
the bowed figure by the arm, and forced it back to e very-day 





life. We could no longer taste the luxury of tears. For clays 
our people lived on the refuse left by the army, the bits of 
meat and bread they had thrown aside from their plenty ; we 
picked up the corn with which they had fed their horses, ker 
nel by kernel, and boiled it for our dinner ; we groped in the 
ashes of their camp-fires ; little children learned the sagacity 
of dogs seeking for bones, and quarreled over their findings. 
The fortune of war, do you say ? Yes, the fortune of war ! 
But it is one thing to say, and another thing to feel ! 

" We came away, madam, for our home was in ashes old 
Cassy, the child, and I ; we came on foot to this place, and 
here we have staid. No, the fields are never cultivated now. 
The dike has been broken down in too many places, and 
freshets have drained all the good out of the soil ; the land is 
worthless. It was once my father's richest field. Yes, Cassy 
is dead. She was buried by her own people, who forgave her 
at the last for having been so spiritless as to stay with young 
missis, when she might have tasted the glories of freedom 
over in the crowded hollow where the blacks were enjoying 
themselves and dying by the score. In six months half of 
them were gone. They had their freedom oh, yes, plenty of 
it ; they were quite free to die ! For, you see, madam, their 
masters, those villainous old masters of theirs, were no longer 
there to feed and clothe them. Oh ! it was a great deliver 
ance for the enfranchised people ! Bitter, am I ? Put your 
self in my place. 

" What am I going to do ? Nothing. The boy ? He 
must take his chances. Let him grow up under the new 
rtgime ; I have told him nothing of the old. It may be that 
he will prosper ; people do prosper, they tell me. It seems 
we were wrong, all wrong ; then we must be very right now, 
for the blacks are our judges, councilors, postmasters, repre 
sentatives, and law-makers. That is as it should be, isn't it ? 
What ! not so ? But how can it be otherwise ? Ah, you 
think that a new king will arise who knows not Joseph that 
is, that a new generation will come to whom these questions 



 

will be things of the past. It may be so ; I do not know. I 
do not know anything certainly any more, for my world has 
been torn asunder, and I am uprooted and lost. No, you can 
not help me, no one can help me. I can not adjust myself to 
the new order of things ; I can not fit myself in new soil ; the 
fibers are broken. Leave me alone, and give your help to the 
young ; they can profit by it. The child ? Well, if if you 
really wish it, I will not oppose you. Take him, and bring 
him up in your rich, prosperous North ; the South has no 
place for him. Go, and God speed you ! But, as for me, I 
will abide in mine own country. It will not be until such as 
I have gone from earth that the new blood can come to her. 
Let us alone ; we will watch the old life out with her, and 
when her new dawning comes we shall have joined our dead, 
and all of us, our errors, our sins, and our sufferings will be 
forgotten." 



Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven 
With intricate shades of the vines that, myriad cloven, 
Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs. 

.... Green colonnades 

Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods, 
Of the heavenly woods and glades, 
That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within 
The wide sea-marshes of Glynn. 

.... Free 

By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea. 
Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band 
Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land. 

Inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and 

curl 
As a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows the firm, sweet limbs of 

a girl. 

A league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade, 
Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade. 

SIDNEY LAMER. 

CHRISTINE and I found her there. She was a small, dark- 
skinned, yellow-eyed child, the offspring of the ocean and the 
heats, tawny, lithe and wild, shy yet fearless not unlike one 
of the little brown deer that bounded through the open reaches 
of the pine-barren behind the house. She did not come to 
us we came to her ; we loomed into her life like genii from 
another world, and she was partly afraid and partly proud of 
us. For were we not her guests ? proud thought ! and, bet 
ter still, were we not women ? "I have only seen three wo 
men in all my life," said Felipa, inspecting us gravely, " and I 
like women. I am a woman too, although these clothes of 
the son of Pedro make me appear as a boy ; I wear them on 



 

account of the boat and the hauling in of the fish. The son 
of Pedro being dead at a convenient age, and his clothes fit 
ting me, what would you have ? It was a chance not to be 
despised. But when I am grown I shall wear robes long and 
beautiful like the senora s." The little creature was dressed 
in a boy's suit of dark-blue linen, much the worse for wear, 
and torn. 

" If you are a girl, why do you not mend your clothes? " 
I said. 

" Do you mend, senora ? " 

" Certainly : all women sew and mend." 

" The other lady ? " 

Christine laughed as she lay at ease upon the brown car 
pet of pine-needles, warm and aromatic after the tropic day's 
sunshine. " The child has divined me already, Catherine," 
she said. 

Christine was a tall, lissome maid, with an unusually long 
stretch of arm, long sloping shoulders, and a long fair throat ; 
her straight hair fell to her knees when unbound, and its clear 
flaxen hue had not one shade of gold, as her clear gray eyes 
had not one shade of blue. Her small, straight, rose-leaf lips 
parted over small, dazzlingly white teeth, and the outline of
