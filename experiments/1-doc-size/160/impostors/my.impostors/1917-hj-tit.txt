"Yes," said Gray consistently, "isn't he a 




 

wise old specimen ? It's rather horrid for me 
having thus to mention, as if you had applied 
to me for a place, that I've picked up a good 
'character' of you, but since you insist on it he 
assured me that I couldn't possibly have a better 
friend." 

"Well, he's a most unscrupulous old person 
and ought really to be ashamed. What it comes 
to," Haughty added, "is that though I've re- 
peatedly stayed with them they've to the best 
of his belief never missed one 6£ the spoons. The 
fact is that even if they had poor Davey wouldn't 
know it." 

"He doesn't take care of the spoons?" Gray 
asked in a tone that made his friend at once swing 
round and away. He appeared to note an un- 
expectedness in this, yet, "out" as he was for 
unexpectedness, it could grow, on the whole, 
clearly, but to the raising of his spirits. "Well, 
I shall take care of my loose valuables and, un- 
warned by the Bradhams and likely to have such 
things to all appearance in greater number than 
ever before, what can I do but persist in my 
notion of asking you to keep with me, at your 
convenience, some proper count of them ? " After 
which as Horton's movement had carried him 
quite to the far end of the room, where the force 
of it even detained him a little, Gray had him 
again well in view for his return, and was prompted 
thereby to a larger form of pressure. "How can 





 

you pretend to palm off on me that women mustn't 
in prodigious numbers 'trust' you?" 

Haughty made of his shoulders the most pro- 
digious hunch. "What importance, under the 
sun, has the trust of women — in numbers how- 
ever prodigious ? It's never what's best in a man 
they trust — it's exactly what's worst, what's most 
irrelevant to anything or to any class but them- 
selves. Their kind of confidence," he further 
elucidated, "is concerned only with the effect of 
their own operations or with those to which they 
are subject; it has no light either for a man's 
other friends or for his enemies : it proves nothing 
about him but in that particular and wholly de- 
tached relation. So neither hate me nor like me, 
please, for anything any woman may tell you." 

Horton's hand had on this renewed and em- 
phasised its proposal of good-night; to which his 
host acceded with the remark: "What superfluous 
precautions you take!" 

"How can you call them superfluous," he asked 
in answer to this, "when you've been taking them 
at such a rate yourself? — in the interest, I mean, 
of trying to persuade me that you can't stand on 
your feet?" 

"It hasn't been to show you that I'm silly about 
life — which is what you've just been talking of. 
It has only been to show you that I'm silly about 
affairs," Gray said as they went at last through 
the big bedimmed hall to the house doors, which 





 

stood open to the warm summer night under the 
protection of the sufficient outward reaches. 

"Well, what are affairs but life?" Vinty, at 
the top of the steps, sought to know. 

"You'll make me feel, no doubt, how much 
they are — which would be very good for me. 
Only life isn't affairs — that's my subtle distinc- 
tion," Gray went on. 

"I'm not sure, I'm not sure!" said Horton 
while he looked at the stars. 

"Oh rot — / am!" Gray happily declared; to 
which he the next moment added: "What it 
makes you contend for, you see, is the fact of my 
silliness." 

"Well, what is that but the most splendid fact 
about you, you jolly old sage ?" — and his visitor, 
getting off, fairly sprang into the shade of the 
shrubberies. 







BOOK FOURTH 
I 

Again and again, during the fortnight that fol- 
lowed his uncle's death, were his present and his 
future to strike our young man as an extraordi- 
nary blank cheque signed by Mr. Betterman and 
which, from the moment he accepted it at all, he 
must fill out, according to his judgment, his cour- 
age and his faith, with figures, monstrous, fan- 
tastic, almost cabalistic, that it seemed to him 
he should never learn to believe in. It was not 
so much the wonder of there being in various New 
York institutions strange deposits of money, to 
amounts that, like familiar mountain masses, ap- 
peared to begin at the blue horizon and, sloping 
up and up toward him, grew bigger and bigger 
the nearer he or they got, till they fairly overhung 
him with their purple power to meet whatever 
drafts upon them he should make; it was not the 
tone, the climax of dryness, of that dryest of men 
Mr. Crick, whose answering remark as to any 
and every particular presumption of credit was 
"Well, I guess I've fixed it so as you'll find some- 
thing there"; that sort of thing was of course 
fairy-tale enough in itself, was all the while and in 





 

a hundred connections a sweet assault on his 
credulity, but was at the same time a phase of 
experience comparatively vulgar and that tended 
to lose its edge with repetition. The real, the 
overwhelming sense of his adventure was much 
less in the fact that he could lisp in dollars, as it 
were, and see the dollars come, than in those vast 
vague quantities, those spreading tracts, of his 
own consciousness itself on which his kinsman's
