none or all of these things could quench, Teen had carried
a sweet dignity of her own as the racer in the old 
Promethean festival carried the torch while he ran 




against the wind. Jack knew, — oh yes, he knew. 
But he grew sullen, suspicious. When he was drunk 
he was always jealous ; it began to take that form. 
When he was sober he still admired his wife ; sometimes
he went so far as to remember that he loved her.
When this happened, Teen dried her eyes, and brushed 
her yellow hair, and washed up the kitchen floor, and 
made the coffee, and said to the grocer when she paid 
for the sugar : 

"My husband has reformed." 

One night Jack came home unexpectedly ; a strange 
mood sat upon him, which his wife did not find herself 
able to classify by any of the instant and exquisite 
perceptions which grow, like new faculties, in wives. He 
had been drinking heavily when he left her, and she had 
not looked for him for days ; if he sailed as he was, it 
would be a matter of weeks. Teen went straight to 
him ; she thought he might be hurt ; she held out her 
arms as she would to one of her children ; but he met 
her with a gesture of indifference, and she shrank back. 

"She's here," said Jack. " Mother Mary 's in this 
d town. I see her." 

"I wish she'd talk to you," said Teen, saying pre- 
cisely the wrong thing by the fatal instinct which so 
often possesses drunkards' wives. 

" You do, do you ? " quoth Jack. " Well, I don't. I 
haven't give her the chance." He crushed on his hat 
and stole out of the house again. 

But his mood was on him yet ; the difference being 
that his wife was out of it. He sulked and skulked 
about the streets alone for a while ; he did not go back 
to the boys just then, but wandered with the apparent 
aimlessness in which the most tenacious aims are 


hidden. Mother Mary and her husband were holding 
sailors' meetings in the roughest quarter of the town. 
There was need enough of Mother Mary in Fairharbor. 
A crowd had gathered to hear the novelty. Fairharbor 
seamen were none too used to being objects of consideration ; 
it was a matter of mark that a parson and a lady 




should hire a room from a rich fish-firm, pay for it out 
of their own scanty pockets, and invite one in from deck 
or wharf, in one's oil-clothes or jumper, to hear what a 
messmate of Jack's called a "high-toned prayer." He 
meant perhaps to convey the idea that the petition 
treated the audience politely. 

Jack followed the crowd in the dark, shrinking in its 
wake, for he was now sober enough not to feel like himself.
He waited till the last of the fellows he knew had 




gone into the place and then crept up on tiptoe, and 
put his face against the window of the salt-cod warehouse 
where the little congregation was gathered, and 
looked in. The room was full and bright. It wore that 
same look of peace and shelter which he remembered. 
Mother Mary stood, as she had stood before, tall and 
pale in her black dress, with the white covering on her 
bosom. Her husband had been speaking to the fishermen, 
and she, as Jack put his gnarled hand to his ex- 
cited eyes and his eyes to the window -glass, turned 
her face full about, to start the singing. She seemed 
to Jack to look at him. Her look was sad. He felt 
ashamed, and cowered down below the window-sill. 
But he wanted to hear her sing. — he had never heard 
anybody sing like Mother Mary, — and so he stayed there 
for a little while, curled against the fish-house. It 
began to rain, and he was pretty wet ; but Jack was in his 
jumper, and a ragged old jumper at that; he knew he 
was not so handsome as he used to be ; he felt that he 
cut a poor figure even for a drunken fisherman ; all the 
self-respect that life had left him shrank from letting 
Mother Mary see him. Jack would not go in. A con- 
fused notion came to him, as he crouched against the 
warehouse, in the showers, that it was just as well it 
should rain on him ; it might wash him. He pushed up 
his sleeves and let the rain fall on his arms. He found 
an old Cape Ann turkey - box there was lying about, 
turned it edgewise so that one ragged knee might rest 
upon it, and thus bring his eye to a level with the window-sill, 
while yet he could not be seen from within. So 
he crouched listening. The glimmer from the prayer- 
room came across the fisherman's bared right arm, and 
struck the crucifix. Jack had the unconscious attitude 
of one sinking, who had thrown up his arms to be saved. 
The Christ on the crucifix looked starved and sickly. 
Jack did not notice the crucifix. 

At this moment Mother Mary's yearning voice rang 
out above the hoarse chorus of the fishermen, whose 
weather-ragged and reverent faces lifted themselves 



" I'm reformed:' 

mistily before her, as if they had been the countenance 
of one helpless man : 

" Rock of Ages, cleft for me ! " 

" Oh, my God ! " cried Jack. 

IV. 

It was the next day that some one told Mother Mary, 
at the poor boarding-house where she stayed, that a 
woman wanted a few words with her. The visitor was 
Teen. She was worn and wan and sobbing with excite- 
ment. Her baby was soon to be born. She did not 
look as if she had enough to eat. She had come, she 
said, just to see Mother Mary, just to tell her, for Jack 
never would tell himself, but she was sure her husband 
had reformed ; he would never drink again ; he meant to 
be a sober man ; and Mother Mary ought to know she 
did it, for she did, God bless her ! 

" I 've walked all this way to bless you for myself," 
said Teen. " I ain't very fit for walkin', nor I can't afford 
a ferry-ticket, for he didn't leave me nothin' on this 
trip, but I Ve come to bless you. My husband come to 
your meetin', Mother Mary, by himself, Jack did. He 
never goes to no meetin's, — nobody couldn't drove 
him ; but he come to yours because he says you treat a 
man like folks, and he wouldn't go inside, for he 'd ben 
drinkin' and he felt ashamed. So he set outside upon 
a box behind the winder and he peeked in. And he said 
it rained on him while he set peekin', for he wanted to 
get a look at you. And he come home and told me, 
for we 'd had some words beforehand, and I was glad to 
see him. I was settin' there and cryin' when he come. 
'I wouldn't, Teen,' says he, 'for I've seen Mother 



Mary, and I 'm reformed,' says he. So he told me how 
he set upon the box and peeked. He says you looked 
straight at him. He says you stood up very tall and 
kind of white. He says you read something out of a
