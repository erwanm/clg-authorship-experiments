"I suppose the key note is jealousy. Only a 
large-minded woman ought ever to accept the 
children of a dead mother." 

"Or a woman hungering for love and never 
having been satisfied." 

Helen caught her friend's hand in an eager 
clasp. "Something lovely ought to happen to 
you," she said in a kind of impassioned tone. "A 
great house full of people, little and big, and all 
the love you want." 

Why had so many people loved her, Helen 
wondered? 

"Girls, come in and let us have a good sing," 
exclaimed Miss Aldred. "Miss Craven must play 





for US. We have lengthened out our holiday, and 
I hope you have had a good time." 

"And you are just lovely!" declared one en- 
thusiastic girl presently. "The clock is striking 
ten and you lengthen out the indulgence. Will 
you give us another half -hour?" 

"We are just a family now and not a school," 
said Mrs. Aldred. "And, girls, you cannot think 
how gratifying it is to have you so glad to come 
back, so eager to go on with your studies, so am- 
bitious, so cordial to each other. I hope it will be 
a happy and successful year, and that we shall not 
only strive for some new virtues, but practise 
those we have already acquired, that our char- 
acters may not be like the shifting sand of the sea 
shore, sparkling, fascinating but forever chang- 
ing. And now you may have your half-hour for 
singing." 

A very delightful time it proved, and there 
were heartfelt good nights, as they trooped up the 
stairs. 

"Oh," Helen said with a long breath, "it is so 
satisfying to live among girls in your girlhood." 
Yet she looked with a sweet resignation at those 
months when she was without any such delight, 
when the vitality of hope and joy was relegated 
to the background. "Poor father." How many 



 

a time she had breathed a little prayer for the 
dead. It would not harm her. 

Sunday was another glorious day. The girls 
went to their different churches, the smaller ones 
in the care of Miss Wiley. Miss Craven had 
spent a few moments with her two little girls and 
somehow she felt very happy herself and at rest. 
A year without any changes or anxiety looked 
attractive. She was beginning to enjoy being 
settled. 

Mrs. Danforth hurried out of church a little to 
meet them, smiling and eager. 

"Oh," she exclaimed, "wasn't it odd that you 
should meet Gordon down there at Balem ! He 
has been such friends with the Travis family, but 
he had not seen you, Miss Grant, in such a long 
time, yet he said you had grown into just the big 
girl one could surely predict And your charm- 
ing friend, Mrs. Wilmarth! He did enjoy the 
fortnight so. You must come to the Parsonage 
some afternoon and let us talk it all over. To 
think I shall not see him for two, perhaps three, 
years. But his father was very proud of the 
appointment.** 

"We all had a delightful time," Helen replied 
with her bright smile. She was glad he had en-

joyed it as well. It brought a peculiar nearness 
to another mother. There were some charming 
mothers in the world. 



CHAPTER X 

THE BEGINNING OF THINGS 

A WHOLE school year with no break, nothing 
of importance happening, for there was no one 
now who had a first claim on her, Helen Grant 
thought, as she took her place in her classes with 
enthusiastic gladness. She did so love to study, 
to acquire knowledge, to reach out into the rich- 
ness of the whole earth. Not all of it, but a bit 
here and there ; no brain could hold it all. She 
was a born student. Her old teacher, Mr. War- 
field, thought he had made her one, but he had 
only tilled the ground ; the seed had been planted 
by a Higher Hand. 

And beside the study, she found life was grow- 
ing in breadth and meaning, that each day the 
mystery was unfolding, the joy becoming more 
intense, the influences all pervading. It was not 
a straight line, though duty is often considered 
that; it was a step one way and another, some- 
times the wrong way and then one had to retrace. 
Why couldn't God have made people so clear- 
eyed they could see at once ! 


Yet with her quick sense of fun she soon be- 
came the same favorite with the larger girls as 
she had been with, the smaller ones two years be- 
fore. And girls began to give her confidences. 
Polly Henderson told her of her engagement. 

'*Of course you know I had to tell Mrs. Aldred, 
and mother wrote explaining, but Tm not going 
to breathe it to another soul. Only I did want 
you to know. I must have some one to rejoice 
with me. Did you ever know of such a perfect 
romance ?" 

Helen was interested. Love matters are such 
a sweet mystery to the girl who knows nothing 
about them. 

"Generally the mothers don't like it, you see. 
They're jealous to have their sons love any one 
else. But Mrs. Stopford isn't. It's queer, but 
she seems as if she might be Ernest's grand- 
mother. Her hair is snowy white, and she was 
forty years old when Ernest was born, and had 
been married seven years. And she wishes she 
had five, like mother. So she wants Ernest to be 
married, and she's just old-fashioned enough to 
think I am real pretty. I have a lovely com- 
plexion and color and my hair is a pretty shade. 
Ernest likes light hair, his is brown, quite dark. 
He's â€” well, he isn't handsome, but he is quite tall
