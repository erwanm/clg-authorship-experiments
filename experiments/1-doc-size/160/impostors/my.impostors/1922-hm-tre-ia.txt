Girl, you've gone and done it!" 

He leaned down and caught her by the hand, and 
then raced with her to the bungalow. 

Five hours later she tiptoed down the hall and 





paused at the threshold of what they now called his 
study. There were no doors in the bungalow; in- 
steady there were curtains of strung bead and bam- 
boo, always tinkling mysteriously. His pipe hung 
dead in his teeth, but the smoke was dense about 
him. His hand flew across the paper. As soon as 
he finished a sheet, he tossed it aside and began 
another. Occasionally he would lean back and 
stare at the window which gave upon the sea. But 
she could tell by the dullness of his eyes that he saw 
only some inner vision. 

  Unobserved, she knelt and kissed the threshold: 
for she knew what kisses were now. The curtain 
tinkled as her head brushed it, but he neither saw 
nor heard. 



CHAPTER XXn 

EVERY morning at dawn it was Spurlock's 
custom to take a plunge in the lagoon. Ruth 
took hers in the sea, but was careful never to 
go beyond her depth because of the sharks. She 
always managed to get back to the bungalow be- 
fore he did. 

As she came in this morning she saw that the 
lamp was still burning in the study; so she stopped 
at the door. Spurlock lay with his head on his 
arms, asleep. The lamp was spreading soot over 
everything and the reek of kerosene was stronger 
than usual. She ran to the lamp and extinguished 
it. Spurlock slept on. It was still too dark for 
reading, but she could see well enough to note the 
mmiber of the last page —  fifty-six. 

Ruth wore a printed cotton kimono. She tied 
the obi clumsily about her waist, then gently laid 
her hand on the bowed head. He did not move. 
Mischief bubbled up in her. She set her fingers in 
the hair and tugged, drawing him to a sitting pos- 
ture and stooping so that her eyes would be on the 
level with his when he awoke. 

He opened his eyes, protestingly, and beheld the 
realization of his dream. He had been dreaming of 

 





Ruth — an old recurrency of that dream he had h td 
in Canton, of Ruth leading him to the top of tibe 
mountain. For a moment he believed this mereljr 
a new phase of the dream. He smiled. 

"The Dawn Pearl!" he said, making to recline 
again. 

But she was relentless. "Hoddy, wake up!'' 
She jerked his head to and fro imtil the hair stung. 

"What? .... Oh! ... . Well, good Lord!'' 
He wrenched loose his head and stood up, sending  
the chair clattering to the floor. Rollo barked. 

" Go and take your plunge while I attend to break- 
fast." 

He started to pick up a sheet of manuscript, but 
she pushed him from t}ie table toward the door- 
way; and he staggered out of the bungalow, sud- 
denly stretched his arms, and broke into a trot. 

Ruth returned to the table. The tropical dawn 
is swift. She could now see to read; so she stirred 
the manuscript about until she came upon the first 
page. "The Beachcombers." 

Romance! The Seven Seas are hers. She roves the blue 
fields of the North, with the dean North Wind on her lips and her 
blonde head jewelled with frost — smocking valour and hardihood! 
Out of the West she comes, riding the great ships and the endless 
steel ways that encompass the earth, and smoke comes with her 
and the glare of furnace fires — commerce! From the East she 
brings strange words upon her tongue and strange raiment 
upon her shoulders and the perfume of myrrh —  antiquity! But 
oh! when she springs from the South, her rosy feet trailing the 
lotus, ripe loquats wreathing her head, in one hand the bright 



 

torch of danger and in the other the golden apples of love, with 
her eyes full of sapphires and her mouth full of pearls! 

"With her eyes full of sapphires and her mouth 
full of pearls." All day long the phrase interpo- 
lated her thoughts. 

A week later the manuscript was polished and 
typewritten, ready for the test. Spurlock felt very 
well pleased with himself. To have written a short 
story in a week was rather a remarkable feat. 

It was at breakfast on this day that he told Ruth 
he had sent to Batavia for some dresses. They 
would arrive sometime in June. 

"That gown is getting shabby." 

Ruth spread out the ruffled skirt, sundrily torn 
and soiled. "I haven't worn anything else in weeks. 
I haven't touched the other." 

"Anything like that?'' 

"Yes; but the colour is lavender." 

"Wear that to-night, then. It fits your style. 
You are very lovely, Ruth." 

She wanted to dance. The joy that filled her 
veins with throbbing fire urged her to rise and go 
swinging and whirling and dipping. She sat per- 
fectly still, however. 

"I am glad you think that," she replied. "Please 
tell me whenever I am at fault." 

"I wish you did have some faults, Ruth. You're 
an angel of goodness." 

"No, no! I have had wicked thoughts." 



. 

He laughed and pushed back his chair. ''So has 
the butterfly evil thoughts. We re to be given a 
treat to-night. McClintock will be tuning up the 
piano to-day. I say, I'll take the yam over and read 
it to McClintock. That old chap has a remarkable
