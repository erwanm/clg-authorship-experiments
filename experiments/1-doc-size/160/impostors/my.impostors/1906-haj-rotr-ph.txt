accident was clearly of your own making. We gave you plenty of room,
but you turned directly into our course twice. Be thankful that you
weren't ground up under the paddle-wheel."

"Yes, and be thankful that Randy Thompson threw you a life preserver,"
put in Jones.

At the mention of our hero's name Bob Bangs looked around in surprise.
He had not noticed Randy before.

"What, you here!" he exclaimed and did not seem particularly happy over
the meeting.

"I am," answered Randy.

"Did you throw out that line with the preserver?" asked the captain.

"I did, sir," and Randy touched his cap.

"I am glad to know it," and the captain's face showed his appreciation
of Randy's prompt action.

"What are you doing here--in that outfit?" asked Bob Bangs, curiously.

"I am a deckhand on this steamboat."

"Pooh! a deckhand!" and the rich boy's nose went up into the air in
disdain. He would give Randy no credit for helping to save his life.

"Clear the deck, please!" called out Captain Hadley, to the crowd that
was pressing in on all sides. "The excitement is over. The boy is
safe."

"I want you to put me ashore," said Bob Bangs.

"We'll make a landing a mile below here," said the Captain.

"I don't want to go to the next landing."

"Sorry, but we can't turn back," answered Captain Hadley.

"What about my boat?"

"We'll take it in tow."

This was done, and in a few minutes the Helen Shalley had resumed her
journey. Bob Bangs was led to one of the staterooms and offered a dry
suit of clothes, which he put on.

"I'll take your name and address," said Captain Hadley.

"What for?"

"As a matter of record. And remember, I want the clothing returned."

"Humph! Maybe my father will sue you for damages!"

"If he does he will lose the case."

Inside of five minutes the next landing place was made, and Bob Bangs
went ashore, taking his wet suit with him. The damaged sloop was tied
up at the dock, and having discharged and taken on passengers and
baggage the steamboat sped on her way once more.

"He's as mad as a wet hen," said Jones to Randy. "And he ought to be
thankful for having his life spared."

"He always was a mean sort of fellow," answered our hero. "And his
folks are just as mean as he is."

"Then maybe they will try to make trouble for the steamboat owner."

Amos Bangs did try to make trouble. Two days after the accident on the
river Andrew Shalley received a letter which ran in part as follows:

    "As you perhaps know, my son, Robert Bangs, was out on the Hudson
    on the 6th inst., in his sloop, when, without any cause whatsoever,
    your steamboat, the Helen Shalley, ran into his boat, smashed it
    completely and put him in peril of his life.

    "I am a man of few words, sir, and I demand damages for this
    outrage. If you wish to settle, you may send me your check for one
    thousand dollars; if not, I will sue you for that amount."




CHAPTER XX

WHAT CAME OF A DEMAND


The letter from Amos Bangs worried Andrew Shalley a little and he at
once called on Captain Hadley, as soon as the steamboat made a landing
at Nyack.

"It seems you ran down a boy a few days ago," said the steamboat owner.

"He tried to run us down," answered the captain, quietly.

"Was he hurt?"

"Not in the least."

"His father wants a thousand dollars' damages."

"I wouldn't pay him a cent."

"Did you run him down?"

"No, he tried to run us down."

"This is no joke, Captain Hadley."

"I know it, Mr. Shalley. But to threaten us with a suit at law is
absurd. I can bring a dozen witnesses to prove that the accident was
entirely of the boy's making."

"I am glad to hear that," and Andrew Shalley breathed a sigh of relief.
He did not care so much for the money, but he wanted to know that
Captain Hadley was not to blame.

"That boy acted like a little fool from beginning to end," went on the
captain of the steamboat and then told his story. Later Randy was
called up, to relate what he had done, and also Jones.

"If there is any trouble some of the passengers will testify for us,"
said Captain Hadley, and mentioned half a dozen who had said they would
stick to the captain, in case of trouble. The passengers were
well-known citizens, whose testimony would be sure to carry weight in
any court of law.

Having satisfied himself that Amos Bangs had no case against him, the
steamboat owner wrote to the rich manufacturer to that effect. By
return mail he received this reply:

    "Your bluff will not work with me. You are to blame and must pay.
    If I do not receive your check for one thousand dollars by the
    middle of next week I shall bring suit. My son is now in bed and
    under the doctor's care because of the accident."

"Humph! Under the doctor's care, eh?" mused the steamboat owner. "This
certainly seems to be serious after all. He will certainly make trouble
for me even if he doesn't win his case."

Again the steamboat owner interviewed Captain Hadley, and then the pair
called in Randy, to learn what he could tell about the Bangs family in
general. Our hero told all he knew, including the trouble Mr. Bartlett
was having with the iron manufacturer.

"Evidently he is a man to get money in any manner possible," mused
Andrew Shalley. "He will certainly bring suit."

"I don't believe Bob is sick," said Randy. "He must be shamming."

"I wish I knew for sure."

"Perhaps I can find out for you--if you'll give me a day or two off,"
said our hero, struck by a sudden idea.
