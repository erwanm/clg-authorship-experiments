and be happy. But at the same time I was afraid of the 
world for him ; it was so dangerous and dreadful so 
mixed. No doubt I know very little about it. I never 
suspected, I confess, that it contained persons of such 
liberality as yours." 

Rowland replied that evidently she had done the world 
but scanty justice. 

"No," objected Miss Garland after a pause, "it is 
like something in a fairy tale." 

"What, pray?" 

" Your coming here all unknown, so rich and so polite, 
and carrying off my cousin in a golden cloud." 

If this was badinage Miss Garland had the best of it, 
for Rowland almost fell a-musing silently over the ques 
tion whether there were a possibility of irony in the young 
lady 's lucid glance. Before he withdrew Mrs. Hudson 
made him tell her again that Roderick 's powers were 
extraordinary. He had inspired her with a clinging, 
caressing faith in his wisdom. " He will really do great 
things ?" she asked " the very greatest ?" 

" I see no intrinsic reason why he should not." 

"Well, we shall think of that as we sit here alone," 
she rejoined. " Mary and I will sit here and talk about 
it. So I give him up," she went on, as he was going. 
" I am sure you will be the best of friends to him ; but 




if you should ever forget him or grow tired of him if 
you should lose your interest in him and he should come 

to any harm or any trouble, please, sir, remember " 

and she paused, with a tremulous voice. 

" Remember, my dear madam ? " 

" That he is all I have that he is everything and 
that it would be very terrible." 

"In so far as I can help him he shall succeed," was 
all Rowland could say. He turned to Miss Garland to 
bid her good-night, and she rose and put out her hand. 
She was very straightforward, but he could see that if 
she was too modest to be bold she was much too simple 
to be shy. " Have you no injunctions to give me ? " he 
asked to ask her something. 

She looked at him a moment, and then, although she 
was not shy, she blushed. "Make him do his best," 
she said. 

Rowland noted the soft intensity with which the words 
were uttered. "Do you take a great interest in him?" 
he demanded. 

"Certainly." 

" Then if he will not do his best for you he will not 
do it for me." She turned away with another blush and 
Rowland took his leave. 

He walked homeward, thinking of many things. The 
great Northampton elms inter-arched far above in the 
darkness, but the moon had risen and through scattered 
apertures was hanging the dusky vault with silver lamps. 
There seemed to Rowland something intensely serious in 
the scene in which he had just taken part. He had 
laughed and talked and braved it out in self-defence ; 
but when he reflected that he was really meddling with 
the simple stillness of this little New England home, and 
that he had ventured to disturb so much living security 
in the interest of a far-away fantastic hypothesis, he 
paused, amazed at his temerity. It was true, as Cecilia 
had said, that for an unofficious man it was a singular 



 

position. There stirred in his mind an odd feeling of 
annoyance with Roderick for having so peremptorily 
taken possession of his mind. As he looked up and 
down the long vista, and saw the clear white houses 
glancing here and there in the broken moonshine, he 
could almost have believed that the happiest lot for any 
man was to make the most of life in some such tranquil 
spot as that. Here were kindness, comfort, safety, the 
warning voice of duty, the perfect absence of temptation. 
And as Rowland looked along the arch of silvered 
shadow and out into the lucid air of the American night, 
which seemed so doubly vast, somehow, and strange and 
nocturnal, he felt like declaring that here was beauty 
too beauty sufficient for an artist not to starve upon it. 
As he stood there lost in the darkness, he presently 
heard a rapid tread on the other side of the road, accom 
panied by a loud jubilant whistle, and in a moment a 
figure emerged into an open gap of moonshine. He had 
no difficulty in recognising Hudson, who was presumably 
returning from a visit to Cecilia. Roderick stopped 
suddenly and stared up at the moon, with his face vividly 
illumined. He broke out into a snatch of song 

" The splendour falls on castle walls 
And snowy summits old in story ! " 

And with a great musical roll of his voice he went 
swinging off into the darkness again as if his thoughts 
had lent him wings. He was dreaming of the inspira 
tion of foreign lands of castled crags and historic 
landscapes. What a pity, after all, thought Rowland, 
as he went his own way, that he shouldn't have a taste 
of it ! 



 



IV. 

IT had been a very just remark of Cecilia 's that Roderick 
would change with a change in his circumstances. 
Rowland had telegraphed to New York for another berth 
on his steamer, and from the hour the answer came 
Hudson 's spirits rose to incalculable heights. He was 
radiant with good humour, and his charming gaiety 
seemed the pledge of a brilliant future. He had forgiven 
his old enemies and forgotten his old grievances he 
seemed every way reconciled to a world in which he was 
going to count as an active force. He was inexhaust 
ibly jocose and suggestive, and, as Cecilia said, he had 
suddenly become so good that it was only to be feared 
he was going to start not for the Old World, but for the 
Next ! He took long walks with Rowland, who felt 
more and more the fascination of his brilliant disposition. 
Rowland returned several times to Mrs. Hudson s, and 
found the two ladies doing their best to be happy in 
their companion 's happiness. Mary Garland, he thought, 
was succeeding better than her demeanour on his first 
visit had promised. He tried to have some especial 
talk with her, but her extreme reserve forced him to 
content himself with such response to his rather urgent 
overtures as might be extracted from a keenly attentive 
smile. It must be confessed, however, that if the re 
sponse was vague, the satisfaction was great, and that 
Rowland after his second visit kept seeing a lurking 
reflection of this smile in the most unexpected places. 
It seemed strange that she should please him so well at 
so slender a cost ; but please him she did, extraordinarily, 
and his pleasure had a quality altogether new to him.
