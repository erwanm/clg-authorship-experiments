was a little more at leisure, he would go to Catherine 
Dawson, for the particulars of the sad story, or, rather, 
when he could bear to hear of Dora's love for another. 

At this juncture, urgent business summoned him to 
St. Louis. A branch house in that city was reported 
to be in a very critical condition, owing to some fraud- 
ulent dealings. 

" It is too bad ! " Mrs. Lester moaned, " and just 
as we were all feeling so comfortable and happy ! " 

" You will soon have me back !" he exclaimed, with 
a grateful smile for her regard. 

The case was quite a complicated one, involving some 
loss, at the best — but Mr. Tremaine went at it with his 




cool, well-trained business faculties, and soon made 
himself master of the situation. Speculation and liv- 
ing beyond his means, had made a scoundrel of one, 
who, a few years before, had been a most promising 
man. Tremaine felt sick at each new development. 

Having lingered over the details longer than usual, 
one evening, instead of going directly to his hotel, he 
turned into a quiet street for a walk. It was not 
strange that his thoughts should revert to his own home, 
and the faces that watched by his fireside ; Edith in her 
proud, but tender beauty, her soft tones and refined 
ways — well, she was young, and would doubtless marry 
again, it would be a shame to keep such loveliness 
moped up at quiet Woodlea. 

Something startled him — a kind of scuffling and half- 
suppressed oaths. In the shadow of this doorway were 
two figures — and just as he reached them, he saw an 
upraised, gleaming steel, and heard a wild cry, followed 
by a horrible imprecation. The wounded man fell 
heavily, while his assailant sped by like a flash ; and 
ere Tremaine had summoned sufficient presence of mind 
to give an alarm, was out of sight. 

He raised the wounded man, and glanced at him, by 
the glimmer of the nearest lamp. A ghastly face, dis- 
torted with rage and pain, and yet strangely familiar. 
Where had he seen it? 

A crowd poured out of the room above — a second 
or third rate gambling den. An instant confusion of 




tongues, a dozen officious hands, and fifty eager ques- 
tions. Tremaine stood still, aghast. For, surely, that 
face, growing into a dead, frightful composure, was 
Jasper Cameron's ! 

He followed the men up-stairs, while an officer, just 
arrived, commanded silence, and began to make in- 
quiries. Tremaine told his story, and some one was 
despatched for the murderer — for the man had breathed 
his last. 

Of Cameron, they all appeared to know very little in- 
deed. He had frequented the place for the last fort- 
night, plaj-ing quite heavily, and invariably winning. 
The evening before, there bad been a violent altercation 
between him and his opponent, a well-known gambler, 
who had openly accused Cameron of cheating. Yet 
they had met again, and played together with the same 
result. The man had uttered no threats, but left a mo- 
ment after his adversary, and this had been the result. 

Tremaine stayed until after midnight. The dead 
body had been searched, and more than one evidence 
of his nefarious practices found, beside a considerable 
sum of money, and a packet of papers very securely 
sealed. 

" Gentleman," he said, " I have met this man in 
New York. Any private papers that he may have about 
him, should be delivered to his wife, I think. If you 
please, I will be responsible for their safe keeping and 
return. 



No one could guess, what it cost Tremaine to say 
that. Dora's husband ! The man with whom she had 
chosen to link her fate. 

Further than his few pergonal interviews with the 
deceased, Tremaine could give them no information. 
The inquest was appointed for the ensuing day, and the 
party dispersed. 

Ralph Tremaine's first business, the next morning, 
was to discover Cameron's place of abode, and if possi- 
ble, Dora. He shrank from seeing her, but it seemed 
doubly cruel to desert her in this hour of need. He 
found Cameron's name entered at a first-class hotel, 
but no wife. Had she been already condemned to ob- 
scurity? 

The coroner's jury brought in a verdict of murder. 
Selden, the assailant, was still at large. It was known 
that he was in the habit of carryiDg a sword-cane, and 
the two wounds had evidently been given with such a 
weapon. The body of the dead man was turned over 
to his friends, if, indeed, there were any, and efforts to 
capture the murderer redoubled. 

Tremaine gave orders for a quiet burial. He would 
see that his enemy lacked nothing — for Dora's sake. 
The papers being found to relate merely to personal 
matters, were delivered into his custody. 

He perused them, hoping to find some trace of Dora ; 
and a very curious one it was, that he could not under- 
stand at all ; a long, closely written letter, containing thr 



history of a child, and its mother's address, a foreign 
one, with an assumed name. There was also the copy 
of a marriage certificate between Eleanor Duprez and 
Giles Walsingham, a birth record of Dora Walsingham, 
child of the above parties, the address of Mildred 
Cameron in New York, and copy of a deposition sworn 
to by her, concerning the child. 

It seemed to him, that he had heard or read of a for- 
tune, claimed some time before by certain heirs named 
Walsingham. This letter was addressed to Gilbert 
Verner, and the child was not his sister's. Dora, fated 
always to be enveloped in some mystery. Did she 
know of this? 

He was not a man to puzzle or conjecture, he had no 
taste for plunging into secrets, or arranging difficult 
details from a slight clue. He could make nothing 
much out of the papers, neither could he remember the 
story he had heard, so he hurried his business into shape, 
and left for New York at the earliest possible moment. 

He had no desire to look in upon Edith and her 
mother, first of all. The hours seemed interminable- 
long, until he could set to work, and reach some fact, 
that would aid him to unravel the whole. And most of 
all, a desperate fear for Dora's safety and comfort nearly 
drove him wild. What if she were ill, neglected and 
suffering? Oh, why had he resigned her to the care of 
this plausible, treacherous villain ? Why had he not 
insisted upon hearing the truth from her own lips?
