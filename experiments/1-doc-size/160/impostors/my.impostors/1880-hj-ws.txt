a good man ; Catherine wondered a good deal what 
he had meant by that. The statement failed to ap- 
peal to her credence, and it was not grateful to any 
resentment that she entertained. Even in the ut- 
most bitterness that she might feel, it would give 
her no satisfaction to think him less complete. Such 
a saying as that was a part of his great subtlety 
men so clever as he might say anything and mean 
anything ; and as to his being hard, that surely, in 
a man, was a virtue. 

He let her alone for six months more six months 
during which she accommodated herself without a 
protest to the extension of their tour. But he spoke 
again at the end of this time : it was at the very last, 
the night before they embarked for New York, in 
the hotel at Liverpool. They had been dining to- 
gether in a great, dim, musty sitting-room ; and then 
the cloth had been removed, and the Doctor walked 
slowly up and down. Catherine at last took her 
candle to go to bed, but her father motioned her to 
stay. 

" What do you mean to do when you get home ?" 
he asked, while she stood there with her candle in 
her hand. 

" Do you mean about Mr. Townsend ?" 

"About Mr. Townsend." 

" We shall probably marry." 





The Doctor took several turns again while she 
waited. " Do you hear from him as much as ever ?" 

" Yes, twice a month," said Catherine, promptly. 

"And does he always talk about marriage? 1 ' 

" Oh yes ; that is, he talks about other things too, 
but he always says something about that." 

" I am glad to hear he varies his subjects ; his let- 
ters might otherwise be monotonous." 

" He writes beautifully," said Catherine, who was 
very glad of a chance to say it. 

" They always write beautifully. However, in a 
given case that doesn't diminish the merit. So, as 
soon as you arrive, you are going off with him ?" 

This seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and 
something that there was of dignity in Catherine 
resented it. " I cannot tell you till we arrive," she 
said. 

" That's reasonable enough," her father answered. 
" That's all I ask of you that you do tell me, that 
you give me definite notice. When a poor man is 
to lose his only child, he likes to have an inkling of 
it beforehand." 

u Oh, father ! you will not lose me," Catherine 
said, spilling her candle wax. 

" Three days before will do," he went on, " if you 
are in a position to be positive then. He ought to 
be very thankful to me, do you know. I have done 
a mighty good thing for him in taking you abroad; 
your value is twice as great, with all the knowledge 
and taste that you have acquired. A year ago, you 
were perhaps a little limited a little rustic; but 
now you have seen everything, and appreciated ev- 
erything, and you will be a most entertaining com- 





panion. We have fattened the sheep for him be- 
fore he kills it." Catherine turned away, and stood 
staring at the blank door. " Go to bed," said her 
father ; " and as we don't go aboard till noon, you 
may sleep late. We shall probably have a most un- 
comfortable voyage." 



 




CHAPTEE XXY. 




THE voyage was indeed uncomfortable, and Cath- 
erine, on arriving in New York, had not the com- 
pensation of "going off," in her father's phrase, 
with Morris Townsend. She saw him, however, 
the day after she landed ; and in the mean time he 
formed a natural subject of conversation between 
our heroine and her aunt Lavinia, with whom, the 





night she disembarked, the girl was closeted for a 
long time before either lady retired to rest. 

" I have seen a great deal of him," said Mrs. Pen- 
niman. " He is not very easy to know. I suppose 
you think you know him ; but you don't, my dear. 
You will some day ; but it will only be after you 
have lived with him. I may almost say I have 
lived with him," Mrs. Penniman proceeded, while 
Catherine stared. " I think I know him now ; I 
have had such remarkable opportunities. You will 
have the same or, rather, you will have better;" 
and Aunt Lavinia smiled. " Then you will see 
what I mean. It's a wonderful character, full of 
passion and energy, and just as true." 

Catherine listened with a mixture of interest and 
apprehension. Aunt Lavinia was intensely sym- 
pathetic, and Catherine, for the past year, while she 
wandered through foreign galleries and churches, 
and rolled over the smoothness of posting roads, 
nursing the thoughts that never passed her lips, had 
often longed for the company of some intelligent 
person of her own sex. To tell her story to some 
kind woman at moments it seemed to her that this 
would give her comfort, and she had more than once 
been on the point of taking the landlady, or the nice 
young person from the dress-maker's, into her con- 
fidence. If a woman had been near her, she would 
on certain occasions have treated such a companion 
to a fit of weeping ; and she had an apprehension 
that, on her return, this would form her response to 
Aunt Lavinia's first embrace. In fact, however, the 
two ladies had met, in Washington Square, without 
tears ; and when they found themselves alone to- 





gether a certain dryness fell upon the girl's emo- 
tion. It came over her with a greater force that 
Mrs. Penniman had enjoyed a whole year of her 
lover's society, and it was not a pleasure to her to
