but the rich can have the real comforts of life — 
fires that never go out, and other luxuries. Rilla, 
fill up the kettle so that the hens can have some 
warm water. 

“ Come, Dan — this way.” 

Prim rushed out with them. Isn’t it funny? ” 
she began. “We were going to have Speckly for 
our Christmas dinner. She hadn’t laid an egg all 
the fall. To be sure, she was moulting and getting 
old, mother thought, and here are two beautiful 
eggs ! ” 

Speckly had flown off the nest with a great flap 
of the wings, and cackled with all her might. 

“ Do you suppose she laid them both this morn- 
ing ? ” Dan asked gravely. “ They’re fine. What 
is she? ” 

“ Oh, just a common hen, and not much to look 
at. But she laid nearly all summer. She’s rather 
lopsided. Mother thinks she must have been hurt 
in her chickenhood.” 

Speckly was ungainly, with long legs and some- 
thing like a Houdan topknot, and her feathering 



comprised nearly every hue. Linn said she was 
like the man’s zebra that had “ nary stripe alike.” 
Even the tail-feathers varied. 

“ And now that she has begun, she’ll go on 
and on, just taking a few days’ rest now and 
then.” 

She’s worth having, then, if it isn’t for her 
beauty,” said Dan. Then he began to catch them 
and tie their legs together and put them in a coarse 
bag. Such a squawking and screeching and flap- 
ping of wings, and the two big chanticleers lifting 
up their stentorian tones! The three human be- 
ings added their heartiest laughs. 

Marigold came in with her four eggs. 

Did you hear the tremendous, uproarious bom- 
bilation? They weren’t getting hurt, but I sup- 
pose they thought they were being murdered. Do 
hens have a thinking machine? Oh, Tabby, are 
you enjoying a share of our prosperity? I’m 
sorry we can’t take you home, but you’ve lived 
here so long that I know you would run away. 
But what we will do with you I can’t imagine, only 
you shall not starve.” 

Tabby purred her delight, and rubbed against 
them, talking in her cat language. Prim declared 
she understood every word you said to her, but 
that you couldn’t always translate her replies. 




Amaryllis gathered up the articles her mother 
wanted, and looked about to see that everything 
was right. Linn took the warm water out for the 
hens that were to be left. The kettle, which was 
quite thick, would keep it warm a long while. 

Will it be safe to leave the fire? ” asked Dan. 

Oh, there isn’t much now. And if you are 
ready ” 

I have bagged the hens like any other 
marauder,” and Dan laughed. ‘‘ I suppose you 
are not afraid of thieves.” 

I think everybody knows we have nothing of 
any value, and never any money,” returned Ama- 
ryllis gravely. ‘‘ It’s always spent the day it’s 
earned.” 

Then they hurried off home. The hennery at 
Grafton was quite fine, Mr. Gedney having wasted 
considerable money on it. Mr. Mann’s fancies had 
not run largely that way. He had sold off the 
games and the high-priced fowls. The Firth hens 
were turned into a compartment by themselves 
until they were accustomed to the new sur- 
roundings. 

‘‘If you children are hungry, will you go into 
the kitchen and have some lunch?” said Mrs. 
Alden. “ Dinner will be at three, as Lide wishes 
to go home.” 



No one demurred, neither did they disdain the 
bread and butter and delicious ham. To be made 
welcome in the kitchen seemed very homelike. 
Primrose presented her eggs with a most elaborate 
and amusing speech. 

The rest of the family were in the library. It 
was clouding over now, and the wind blew up in 
gusts, but what did it matter to them? Two days 
had changed everything. 

“ Primrose,” began her new father, why are 
you studying your mother so intently? I hope 
you are not plotting a conspiracy to return her to 
the Little Old Red House.” 

The voice was mirthful and the eyes had a 
twinkle in them. 

Oh, she wouldn’t go,” was the frank rejoinder. 

And don’t you always have to stay in your hus- 
band’s house? No, but I was thinking that we 
ought to do something for Christmas Day. Of 
course, yesterday was lovely ” 

Oh, Primrose, don’t beg for anything else,” 
exclaimed her mother deprecatingly. 

Let us hear it,” said Mr. Mann. “ I can’t 
promise you half of my fortune, since there are 
eight of you, but I will do my best.” 

It is this — and it won’t cost any money. Why 
can’t mother put on her marriage dress, and we our 




white frocks, and have a Christmas wedding din- 
ner ? There will never be another Christmas quite 
like this.” 

Oh, yes.” Chan went around and took his 
mother’s hand in both of his. “ We never saw you 
in anything so beautiful before.” 

Primrose, you deserve a silver dollar for that 
thought, new coinage. Yes, we will have it over 
to ourselves to-day. Go and make yourselves en- 
chanting Hebes to grace the feast.” 

Primrose took her mother’s arm and Linn went 
around on the other side, as he said : 

It was all so strange yesterday that somehow 
we didn’t half see you.”
