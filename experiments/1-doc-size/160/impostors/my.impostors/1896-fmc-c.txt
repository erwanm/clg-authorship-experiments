meeting. 'Now go!' she added quickly. 'Go, before she comes to herself.
Do not let her see you again. Go--please go!'

'Yes--I had better go,' he answered. 'Can I not see you again?
Vittoria--I cannot go away like this--'

As he realised that it might be long before he saw her again, his voice
trembled a little, and there was a pleading accent in his words which
she had never heard.

'Yes--no--how can I see you?' she faltered. 'There is no way--no
place--when must you leave?' Maria Carolina stirred, and seemed about to
open her eyes. 'Go--please go!' repeated Vittoria, desperately. 'She
will open her eyes and see you, and it will begin again! Oh, for
Heaven's sake--'

Orsino kissed her suddenly while she was speaking, once, sharply, with
all his heart breaking. Then he swiftly left the room without looking
back, almost trying not to think of what he was doing.

He closed the door behind him. As he turned to look for the way out, in
his confusion of mind, the door opposite, which was ajar, opened wide,
and he was confronted by Tebaldo, who smiled sadly and apologetically.
Orsino stared at him.

'I am afraid you have had an unpleasant scene,' said the Sicilian,
quickly. 'It was a most unfortunate accident--a mistake of the servant,
who took you for the doctor. The fact is, my mother seems to be out of
her mind, and she will not be persuaded that Ferdinando is alive and
well, till she sees him. She was so violent an hour ago that I sent for
a doctor--a specialist for insanity. I am afraid I forgot that you were
coming, in my anxiety about her. I hope you will forgive me. Of course,
you have seen for yourself how she feels towards you at present, and in
any case--at such a time--'

He had spoken so rapidly and plausibly that Orsino had not been able to
put in a word. Now he paused as if expecting an answer.

'I regret to have been the cause of further disturbing your mother, who
indeed seems to be very ill,' said Orsino, gravely. 'I hope that she
will soon recover.'

He moved towards the outer hall, and Tebaldo accompanied him to the door
of the apartment.

'You will, of course, understand that at such a time it will be wiser
not to broach so serious a matter as my sister's marriage,' said
Tebaldo. 'Pray accept again my excuses for having accidentally brought
you into so unpleasant a situation.'

He timed his words so that he uttered the last when he was already
holding the door open with one hand and stretching out the other to
Orsino, who had no choice but to take it, as he said goodbye. Tebaldo
closed the door and stood still a moment in thought before he went back.
As he turned to go in, Vittoria came quickly towards him.

'How did it happen that Don Orsino was brought into the drawing-room?'
she asked, still very pale and excited.

'I suppose the servant took him for the doctor,' said Tebaldo, coolly,
for he knew she would not stoop to ask questions of the footman. 'I am
very sorry,' he added.

He was going to pass on, but she stopped him.

'Tebaldo--I must speak to you--it will do as well here as anywhere. The
nurse is with her,' she said, looking towards the drawing-room. 'She
fainted. Don Orsino told me in two words, before he went away, that he
had spoken to you last night, and that you had told him to come here
to-day.'

'That is perfectly exact, my dear. I have no doubt you have found out
that your admirer, our brother's assassin, is a strictly truthful
person. He insisted upon seeing you; it was impossible to talk at ease
at a party, and I told him to come here, intending to see him myself. I
told him to come at three o'clock--I daresay you know that, too?'

'Yes--he said it was to be at three o'clock.'

Tebaldo took out his watch and looked at it.

'It is now only four minutes to three,' he observed, 'and he is already
gone. He came a good deal before his time, or I should have been in the
antechamber to receive him and take him into my room, out of harm's way,
where I could have explained matters to him. As it is, I was obliged to
show him out with some apology for the mistake.'

'How false you are!' exclaimed Vittoria, her nostrils quivering.

'Because I refuse to ruin you, and our own future position here? I think
I am wise, not false. Yes, I myself assured him last night that he did
not kill our brother, but one of the Pagliuca di Bauso. I took the hand
that did it, and shook it--to save your position in Roman society. You
seem to forget that poor Ferdinando had turned himself into an
outlaw--in plain language, he was a brigand.'

'He was worth a score of his brothers,' said Vittoria, who was not
afraid of him. 'You talk of saving my position. It is far more in order
to save your own chance of marrying the American girl with her fortune.'

'Oh yes,' answered Tebaldo, with perfect calm. 'I include that in the
general advantages to be got by what I say. I do not see that it is so
very false. On the one hand, Ferdinando was my brother. I shall not
forget that. On the other, to speak plainly, he was a criminal. You see
I am perfectly logical. No one is obliged to acknowledge that he is
related to a criminal--'

'No one is obliged to lie publicly, as you do,' broke in Vittoria,
rather irrelevantly. 'As you make me lie--rather than let people know
what kind of men my surviving brothers are.'

'You are not obliged to say anything. You do not go out into the world
just now, because you have to stay with our mother. I will wager that
you have not once told the lie you think so degrading.'

'No--I have not, so far. No one has forced me to.'

'You need only hold your tongue, and leave the rest to me.'

'You make me act a lie--even in not wearing mourning--'

'Of course, if you make morality and honesty depend upon the colour of
your clothes,' said Tebaldo, scornfully, 'I have nothing more to say
about it. But it is a great pity that you have fallen in love with that
black Saracinesca, the assassin. It will be a source of considerable
annoyance and even suffering to you, I daresay. It even annoyed me. It
would have been hard to refuse so advantageous an offer without accusing
him of Ferdinando's death, which is precisely what I will not do, for
the sake of all of us. But you shall certainly not marry him, though you
are inhuman enough to love him--a murderer--stained with your own
blood.'

'He is not a murderer, for it was an accident--and you know it. I am not
ashamed of loving him--though I cared for Ferdinando more than any of
you. And if you talk in that way--if you come between us--' she stopped.

'What will you do?' he asked contemptuously.

'I will tell the truth about Ferdinando,' she said, fixing her eyes upon
him.

'To whom, pray?'

'To Miss Slayback and her aunt,' answered Victoria, her gentle face
growing fierce.

'Look here, Vittoria,' said Tebaldo, more suavely. 'Do you know that
Orsino Saracinesca is going back to Camaldoli? Yes. And you know that
Ferdinando had many friends there, and I have some in the neighbourhood.
A letter from me may have a good deal to do with his safety or danger,
as the case may be. It would be very thoughtless of you to irritate me
by interfering with my plans. It might bring your own to a sudden and
rather sad conclusion.'

Vittoria turned pale again, for she believed him. He was playing on her
fears for Orsino and on her ignorance of the real state of things at
Camaldoli. But for the moment his words had the effect he desired. He
instantly followed up his advantage.

'You can never marry him,' he said. 'But if you will not interfere with
