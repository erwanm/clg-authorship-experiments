lowed her ! I fled, but still it followed, still it kept — 
right across my bows ! I never looked to see where I 
was going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent. 
Why didn’t that villain come? If I commuted the 
crime of ringing a bell I might get thrown overboard. 
But better that than kill the boat. So in blind despera- 
tion, I started such a rattling << shivaree ,, down below 
as never had astounded an engineer in this world before,. 
I fancy. Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines 
began to back and fill in a curious way, and my reason 
forsook its throne — we were about to crash into the 
woods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. 
Bixby stepped calmly into view on the hurricane deck. 
My soul went out to him in gratitude. My distress 
vanished ; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara 
with Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck. He blandly 
and sweetly took his toothpick out of his mouth be- 
tween his fingers, as if it were a cigar, — we were just 
in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree, and the 
passengers were scudding astern like rats, — and lifted 
up these commands to me ever so gently : 

'' Stop the starboard ! Stop the larboard! Set her 
back on both ! ” 

The boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among 
the boughs a critical instant, then reluctantly began to 
back away t 

“ Stop the larboard ! Come ahead on it ! Stop the 
starboard ! Come ahead on it ! Point her for the 
bar!” 

I sailed away as serenely as a summer’s morning. 
Mr. Bixby came in and said, with mock simplicity: 

“ When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap 
the big bell three times before you land, so that the 
engineers can get ready.” 

I blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn’t had 
any hail, 

“Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The 
officer of the watch will tell you when he wants to 
wood up.” 

I went on consuming, and said I wasn’t after wood' 



“ Indeed? Why, what could you want over here in 
the bend, then? Did you ever know of a boat follow- 
ing a bend up-stream at this stage of the river? ” 

“ No, sir — and I wasn’t trying to follow it. I was 
getting away from a bluff reef.” 

“No, it wasn’t a bluff reef; there isn’t one within 
three miles of where you were.” 

“ But I saw it. It was as bluff as that one yonder.” 
“Just about. Run over it! ” 

“ Do you give it as an order? ” 

“ Yes. Run over it ! ” 

“ If I don’t, I wish I may die.” 

“All right; I am taking the responsibility.” 

I was just as anxious to kill the boat, now, as I had 
been to save it before. I impressed my orders upon 
my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a 
straight break for the reef. As it disappeared under 
our bows I held my breath ; but we slid over it like oil. 

“ Now, don’t you see the difference? It wasn’t any- 
thing but a wind reef. The wind does that.” 

“ So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How 
am I ever going to tell them apart? ” 

“ I can’t tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you 
will just naturally know one from the other, but you 
never will be able to explain why or how you know 
them apart.” 

It turned out to be true. The face of the water, in 
time, became a wonderful book — a book that was a 
dead language to the uneducated passenger, but which 
told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its most 
cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with 
a voice. And it was not a book to be read once and 
thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day. 
Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was 
never a page that was void of interest, never one that 
you could leave unread without loss, never one that you 
would want to skip, thinking you could find higher en- 
joyment in some other thing. There never was so 
wonderful a book written by man; never one whose 
interest was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparklingly 
renewed with every re-perusal. The passenger who 
could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of 
faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions when 
he did not overlook it altogether) ; but to the pilot that 
was an italicized passage; indeed, it was more than 
that, it was a legend of the largest capitals, with a string 
of shouting exclamation points at the end of it, for it 
meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that 
could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever 
floated. It is the faintest and simplest expression the 
water ever makes, and the most hideous to a pilot's eye. 
In truth, the passenger who could not read this book 
saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it, 
painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas 
to the trained eye these were not pictures at all, but the 
grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading matter. 

Now when I had mastered the language of this water, 
and had come to know every trifling feature that bor- 
dered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters 
of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. 
But I had lost something, too. I had lost something 
which could never be restored to me while I lived. All 
the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the 
majestic river ! I still kept in mind a certain wonderful 
sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new 
to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to 
blood ; in the middle distance the red hue brightened 
into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, 
black and conspicuous ; in one place a long, slanting 
mark lay sparkling upon the water ; in another the surface 
was broken by boiling, tumbling rings, that were 
as many-tinted as an opal ; where the ruddy flush was 

faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with grace- 
ful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately traced ; 
the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the 
somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in 
one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; 
and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead 
tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame 
in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the 
sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, 
woody heights, soft distances; and over the whole 
scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, 
enriching it every passing moment with new marvels of 
coloring. 

I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a 
speechless rapture. The world was new to me, and I 
had never seen anything like this at home. But as I 
have said, a day came when I began to cease from 
noting the glories and the charms which the moon and 
the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's face; 
another day came when I ceased altogether to note 
them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, 
I should have looked upon it without rapture, and
