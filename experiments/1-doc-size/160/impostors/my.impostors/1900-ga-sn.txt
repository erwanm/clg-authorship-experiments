uncle used to say that nothing amounted to much 
when you got it, but he didn't.know, he didn't know. 
This room is so big, and the light is so soft, and this 
chair is so lazy, and the fire is so warm " She 
looked at Emory with the first impulse of coquetry she 
had ever experienced ; and her eyes were magnificent. 

"Are you, too, happy? " she asked softly. 

He stood up suddenly and gave a little nervous 
laugh, darting an embarrassed glance over his shoulder. 

" I feel uncommonly better than usual," he admitted.

BETTY awoke the next morning with the impression 
that she was somewhere on the border of a negro 
camp-meeting. She had passed more than one when 
driving in the country, and been impressed with the 
religious frenzy for which the human voice seemed the 
best possible medium. As she achieved full consciousness, she understood that it was not a chorus of voices 
that filled her ear, but one, rich, sonorous, impassioned. It was singing one of the popular Methodist 
hymns with a fervor which not even its typical African 
drawl and wail could temper. It was some moments 
before Betty realized that the singer was Harriet 
Walker, and then she sprang out of bed and flung on 
her wrapper. 

" Great heaven ! " she thought. " How shall we 
ever be able to keep her secret ? A bandanna gown 
and a voice like a cornfield darky's ! I suppose all 
the servants are listening in the hall." 

They were, even the upper servants, who were Eng- 
lish, but they scuttled away as their mistress appeared. 
She crossed the hall to Harriet's room, rapped loudly, 
and entered. Her new sister, still in her nightgown, 
was enjoying the deep motion of a rocking-chair, 
hymn-book in hand. She brought her song to a halt 
as Betty appeared, but it was some seconds before the 
inspired expression in her eyes gave place to human 
greeting. Her face happened to be in shadow, and 
for the moment Betty saw her black. Her finely cut 




features were indistinct, and the ignorant fanaticism of 
a not remote grandmother looked from her eyes. 

" Harriet ! " exclaimed Betty. " I don't want to be 
unkind, but you must not do that again. If you want 
to keep your secret, never sing a hymn again as long 
as you live." 

" Ah ! " Harriet gave a gasp, then a half-sob. " Ah ! 
But I love to sing them, honey. I have sung them 
every Sunday all my life, and he loved them. He said 
I could sing with anybody, he wouldn't.except angels. 
I 'most felt he was listening." 

" You have a magnificent voice, and you must have 
it cultivated. But never sing another hymn." 

" When I go to church I know I'll just shout 
without knowing what I 'm doing." 

" Then don't go to church," said Betty, desperately. 

" I must ! I must ! What'll the Lode say to me ? 
Oh, my po' old uncle ! " 

She was weeping like a passionate child. Betty sat 
down beside her and took her hand. 

" Come," she said, "listen to me. The first time I 
saw you the deepest impression I received of you was 
one of fine self-control. Doubtless you wept and 
stormed a good deal before you acquired it at all 
the different stages of what was both renunciation and 
acquisition. The last few days have unsettled you a 
little because you have found yourself in a new world, 
minus all your old responsibilities and trials, and the 
experience has made you feel younger, robbed you of 
some of your hold on yourself. But that habit of self- 
control is in your brain, it is the last to leave us, 
and all you have to do is to sit down and think hard 
and adjust yourself. It is even more important that 



you make no mistakes now than it was before. Fate 
seldom gives any one two chances to begin life over 
again. Think hard and keep a tight rein on yourself." 

Betty had more than negro hymns in her mind, but 
she did not care to be explicit. The generalities of 
the subject were disagreeable enough. 

Harriet had ceased her sobbing and was listening 
intently. She dried her eyes as Betty finished 
speaking. 

"You are right, honey," she said. "And I reckon 
you haven't.spoken any too soon, for I was likely to 
get my head turned. I'll go to church and I won't 
sing. First I'll tie a string round my neck to remember, and after that it'll be easy. I 'm afraid I 'm just 
naturally lazy, and if I didn't.watch myself I 'd soon 
forget all the hard lessons I 've learned and get to be 
like some fat ornary old nigger who 's got an easy job." 

Betty shuddered. " The white race is not devoid of 
laziness. If you want a reason for yours, just remember 
that the Southern sun has prevented many a man from 
becoming great. Keep your mind as far away from 
the other thing as possible." 

Oh, I think I'll forget it. I felt that way yesterday. But perhaps I 'd better not," she added anxiously, as her glance fell on the hymn-book. " No cross, 
no crown." 

" You will find crosses enough as you go through 
life," said Betty, dryly. She rose to go, and Harriet 
rose also and drew herself up to her full height. For 
the moment she looked again the tragic figure of the 
first day of their acquaintance. 

" You must have seen by this time how ignorant I 
am," she said mournfully. " Poor old uncle gave me 




all the schooling he had himself, but I knew even then 
it wasn't.what they have nowadays. And I've had so 
few books to read. Once I found a five-dollar bill, 
and as he wouldn't.take it the most I could do 
I tramped all the way to the nearest town and back, 
twenty miles, and bought a big basket full of cheap 
reprints of English standard novels. Those and the 
few old Latin books and the Bible and the Pilgrim's 
Progress are about all I've ever read. I felt like writing 
you that when I read his letter, and also telling you 
that I was afraid you wouldn't.find me a lady in your 
sense of the word " 

"You are my sister," interrupted Betty; "of course 
you are a lady. Dismiss any other idea from your 
mind. And in a year you will know so much that I 
shall be afraid of you. I have neglected my books for 
several years." 

" You are mighty good, and I'll humbly take all the 
advice you'll give me." 

Betty went back to her room and sought the warm 
nest she had left. " She makes me feel old," she
