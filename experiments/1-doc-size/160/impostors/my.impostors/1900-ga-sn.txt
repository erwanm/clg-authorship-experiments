lake in the cold brilliant sunshine, or in the more mysterious depths of the forest, listening to the silence or 
watching the drops of light fall through the matted tree- 
tops, felt more at peace with the world than she had 
done since her fatal embarkation on the political sea. 
She put the memory of Harriet Walker, insistent at 
first, impatiently aside, and in a day or two that shadow 
crept back to its grave. 

For a few days her mind, in its grateful repose, hesi- 
tated to grapple with the question which had sent her 
to the mountains ; and on one of them, while thinking 
idly on the great political questions which had mag- 
netized so much of her thought during the past year, 
the inspiration for which she had so often longed shot 
up from the concentrated results of thinking and experience, and revealed in what manner she could be of 
service to her country. This was, whatever her personal life, to gather about her, once a week, as many 
bright boys of her own condition as she could find, 
and interest and educate them in the principles of patriotic statesmanship. With her own burning interest 
in the subject and her personal fascination, she could 
accomplish far more than any weary professor could 
do. 

She had come up to these fastnesses to decide the 
future happiness of one or two of three people, and 
she felt sober enough ; but for almost a week she wished 
that she could live here alone for the rest of her life : 
she believed that in time she would be serenely content. She had the largest capacity for human happiness, but she guessed that the imagination could be so 
trained that when far from worldly conditions it could 
create a world of its own, and would shrink more and 
more from the practical realities. For Imagination has 
the instinct of a nun in its depths and loves the cloister of a picturesque solitude. It is a Fool's Paradise, 
but not inferior to the one which mortals are at liberty 
to enter and ruin. 

But Betty could not live here alone, she could not 
ignore her responsibilities in any such primitive fashion ; and so long as her heart was alive it would make 
battle for real and tangible happiness. 

She had a question to decide which involved not 
only the heart but the mind : if she made a mistake 
now, she would be at odds with her higher faculties for 
the rest of her life. She dreaded the sophistry which 
sat on either side of the subject ; and it was a question 
whether the very strength of her impulse toward the 



 

man she had loved for a year was not the strongest 
argument in its favor. 

But she had given her word to another man, and she 
had the high and almost fanatical sense of honor of the 
Southern race. On the other hand, she had a practical modern brain, and during the last year she had 
been living in close contact with much hard common- 
sense. She had imagination, and she knew that she 
already had made Burleigh suffer deeply, and had it in 
her power to raise that suffering to acuteness ; and if 
that buoyant nature were soured, a useful career might 
be seriously impaired. On the other hand, she had 
made a greater man more miserable still, and while he 
was finding life black enough she had rushed into the 
camp of the enemy ; and his capacity for suffering was 
far deeper and more enduring than that of the younger 
man. 

She tried to put herself as much aside from the question as possible, but she had her rights and they made 
themselves heard. She knew, had known at once, that 
she had outraged all she held most dear, in engaging 
herself to one man when she loved another, and she 
had begun to wonder in irresistible flashes before 
the news had come which sent her to the mountains, if 
she should falter at the last moment. But breeding 
has carried many a woman over the ploughshares of 
life, and her mind was probably strong enough to go 
on to the inevitable without theatric climax. At the 
same time the idea of marriage with one man when she 
loved another was abhorrent ; that it was particularly 
so since marriage with the other had become possible, 
she understood perfectly. And although she continued 
to reason and to argue, she had a lurking suspicion that 



 

while she might be strong enough to conquer a desire 
she might not be able to conquer a physical revolt, 
and that it would rout her standards and decide the 
issue. 

She had made up her mind that she would hesitate 
for a month and no longer, and she also had determined that she would decide the question for herself 
and throw none of the responsibility on Senator North ; 
she felt the impulse to write to him impersonally more 
than once. (Perhaps her sense of humor also re- 
strained her.) She wondered if it were one year or 
twenty years since she had gone to him for advice ; 
and she knew that whichever way she decided, the desire for his good opinion would have something to do 
with it. 

There are only a certain number of arguments in 
any brain, and after they have been reiterated a sufficient number of times they palL From argument 
Betty lapsed naturally into meditation, and the subject of these meditations, tender, regretful, and impassioned, was one man only ; and Burleigh had no place 
in them. Occasionally she forced him into her mind, 
but he seemed as anxious to get out as she was to drive 
him ; and after the ice melted and she was able to 
spend hours on the lake, and rest under spreading 
oaks, where she had only to shut her eyes to imagine 
herself companioned, she felt herself unfaithful if she 
cast a solitary thought to Burleigh. 

At the end of the month she was not tired of solitude, but she was tired of her intellectual attitude. 
She was human first and mental afterward; and she 
wanted nothing on earth but to be the wife of the 
man whom she had loved for a lifetime in a year. The 



 

moment she formulated this wish, hesitation fled and 
she could not wind up her engagement with Burleigh 
rapidly enough. Her letter, however, was very sweet 
and apologetic, and it was also very honest. She knew 
that unless she told him she loved another man and 
intended to marry him, he would take the next train 
for the Adirondacks and plead his cause in person. 
His reply was characteristic. 

" Very well," it ran. " I do not pretend to say I was not 
prepared after your last letter from New York. And al- 
though I could not guess your motive in accepting me, I 
knew that you did not love me. But if I am not overwhelmed 
with surprise, the pain is no easier on that account, and will 
not be until the grass has had time to grow over it a little. 
And at least it is a relief to know the worst. Of course I 
forgive you. I doubt if any man could feel bitterly toward 
you. You compel too much love for that. 

" Don't worry about me. I have work enough to do a 
State to talk sense into and a nation to which to devote my 
poor energies. My brain such as it is will be constantly 
occupied, which is the next best good a man can have. 

" ROBERT BURLEIGH." 

Betty wrote him four pages of enthusiastic friendliness in reply, and paid him the compliment of post- 
poning her letter to Senator North until the following 
day. 

But on that day she rose with the feeling that the 
sun never would set. 

She was as brief as possible, for she knew that he 
hated long letters. Nevertheless, she conveyed an 
exact impression of her weeks of deliberation and 
analysis.
