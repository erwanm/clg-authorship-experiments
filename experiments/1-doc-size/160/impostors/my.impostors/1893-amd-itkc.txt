"I feel as if I'd done more than look at the 
promised land ; I've fairly been in it. And the 
Lord just put this in 'your heart, Sabrina. What 
I have to give thanks for is, that you listened and 
went about the Father's business, which, as I take 
it, is giving comfort and joy to human souls. My 
dear, if you and Pearl go on, you'll make the 
waste places blossom like the rose." 

A new and strange humility filled Sabrina East- 
wood's soul. Could she do something besides the 
mere giving of money ? 

" And now," she said, "we must go on to Alex- 
andria Bay. It would be a shame to come so 
near and not see the famous Thousand Isles. It 
doesn't really take us out of our way." 

" My dear, you're too generous to an old woman 
like me!" 




What a world of beauty this was ! What bits 
of poetry it suggested ! They could have lin- 
gered forever in this scene. And then there was 
Lake Champlain and the Au Sable, romantic and 
historic ground. They sailed and drove and ram- 
bled, took railroad journeys hither and thither, 
coming at last down the State of Vermont to the 
little south-westerly corner of New Hampshire, 
with its farms glowing in all the plenitude of 
late summer. 

Mrs. Ford gave the travellers a most hospitable 
welcome. There were suggestions of Aunt Jane 
about her ; but, even with the interest of children 
who had grown up and married, her life had set- 
tled into narrower lines. There had been no wide 
outlooks into the greater world. 

A very plain, old-time farmhouse it was, with 
its high-peaked roof and overhanging eaves, its 
low ceilings and great rooms, its small windows 
with greenish panes of glass, its wide chimneys, 
and high, narrow mantels. The kitchen floor was 
worn and uneven, in spite of its yearly coat of 
paint. Here and there a rug of braided rags ; 
chairs with seats of stout list, the original splints 
having gone their way half a century before. 

It was mid-afternoon when they reached this 
primitive haven of rest. Mrs. Ford was alone, her 
remaining home daughter having gone to visit a 





married sister. She gave them a hearty welcome, 
though she could not forbear bantering her sister 
on " trapesing about as if she were not more than 
twenty,'

"I've almost gone back to twenty," declared 
Mrs. Herrick. " I never felt so young and so re- 
solved to make the best of what remains to life. 
'To whom much is given' — you remember, Mar- 
tha ? I feel as if the whole storehouse of God's 
beautiful earth had been opened to me." 

And if she felt so, how ought it to be with 
herself, Sabrina Eastwood asked in the thinking 
fashion so much her wont of late. 

Stacy had planned to return to Chester House 
with Sabrina. But she had unconsciously learned 
some lessons she thought she had all by heart, from 
sheer necessity, long ago. Sabrina's unassuming 
solicitude had put even her best efforts to shame. 

The two were sitting on the old porch in the 
soft light of the new moon. A neighbor had 
come in, and the elders were having an old-time 
chat in the sitting-room. 

Stacy had said, "Must you go to-morrow.?" and 
Sabrina had answered. 

"You won't mind if I don't return to Greenfields 
with you — will you.?" Stacy began hesitatingly. 

"Why!" Sabrina exclaimed, "I thought" — 

"Yes, I meant to. I was quite tired of this 




place every summer. But I have changed even 
to myself. I can't explain, only I seem to have 
grown out of my careless girlhood, the complacent 
satisfaction with myself that I look back to with 
a feeling of shame. I have always thought if I 
wanted a lovely pattern for my life, I should take 
Pearl Disbrowe" — 

"There could not be a purer or sweeter one," 
Sabrina subjoined softly, in a pause. 

Stacy's hand slipped gently over Sabrina's, and 
in the vague light she could see the shine of the 
beautiful fire opal on the white finger. 

"I want to say something" — her voice had a 
hurried, half-tremulous sound, as if she were try- 
ing to gather courage as she went along. " I have 
never done you full justice. I have looked at you 
from my own narrow point of view. I think I have 
been secretly envious. I didn't want to accept 
your lovely invitation — can you understand that.? 
It was my own pride, because I could not give you 
anything back." 

"O Stacy, as if" — Sabrina's tone showed the 
wound. 

"Yes. Pearl set it before me in its true light. 
You see I am confessing my evil-mindedness. I 
want to say now that it has been one of the les- 
sons, and one of the delights of my life, that I 
shall always treasure. Thanking you for it won't 







express anything. And I am more than grateful 
for Aunt Jane's pleasure."

"It was a pleasure to me; you must believe 
that. And when I recall the many kindnesses in 
my childhood" — Sabrina's voice trembled with 
tender remembrance. 

"I didn't half do you justice. I was afraid you 
might be secretly mortified because we did not 
come up to the modern standards of style. I 
meant to watch over her and check any exuber- 
ance; but you made her appear so simply at home 
everywhere, so at ease, so absolutely ladylike and 
pretty — I must tell you what two ladies said," 
and Stacy repeated the incident of their first day's 
journey. 

" If you hold in such esteem your small debt to
