Like a certain class of modern philosophers, Dinah perfectly scorned logic and reason in every shape, and always 
took refuge in intuitive certainty ; and here she was perfectly 
impregnable. No possible amount of talent or authority, or 
explanation, could ever make her believe that any other way 
was better than her own, or that the course she had pursued 
in the smallest matter could be in the least modified. This 
had been a conceded point with her old mistress, Marie's 
mother ; and " Miss Marie," as Dinah always called her 
young mistress, even after her marriage, found it easier to 
submit than contend; and so Dinah had ruled supreme. 
This was the easier, in that she was perfect mistress of that 
diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of 
manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure. 

Dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of 
excuse-making in all its branches. Indeed, it was an axiom 
with her that the cook can do no wrong ; and a cook in a 
Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on 
which to lay off every sin and frailty, so as to maintain her 
own immaculateness entire. If any part of the dinner was 
a failure, there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it ; 





and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people whom 
Dinah berated with unsparing zeal. 

But it was very seldom that there was any failure in 
Dinah's last results. Though her mode of doing everything 
was peculiarly meandering and circuitous, and without any 
sort of calculation as to time and place, though her kitchen 
generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane 
blowing through it, and she had about as many places for 
each cooking utensil as there were days in the year, yet, if 
one would have patience to wait her own good time, up 
would come her dinner in perfect order, and in a style of 
preparation with which an epicure could find no fault. 

It was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner. 
Dinah, who required large intervals of reflection and repose, 
and was studious of ease in all her arrangements, was seated 
on the kitchen floor, smoking a short stumpy pipe, to which 
she was much addicted, and which she always kindled up, as 
a sort of censer, whenever she felt the need of an inspiration 
in her arrangements. It was Dinah's mode of invoking the 
domestic Muses. 

Seated around her were various members of that rising 
race with which a Southern household abounds, engaged in 
shelling peas, peeling potatoes, picking pin-feathers out of 
fowls, and other preparatory arrangements, Dinah every 
once in a while interrupting her meditations to give a poke 
or a rap on the head to some of the young operators, with 
the pudding-stick that lay by her side. In fact, Dinah ruled 
over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of 
iron, and seemed to consider them born for no earthly 
purpose but to " save her steps," as she phrased it. It was 
the spirit of the system under which she had grown up, and 
she carried it out to its full extent. '  

Miss Ophelia, after passing on her reformatory  
through all the other parts of the establishment, now 

what was going on, and resolved to stand on defensive and 
conservative ground, mentally determined to oppose and  
ignore every new measure, without any actual and observable
contest. 

The kitchen was a large brick-floored apartment, with a 
great old-fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it, 





an arrangement which St. Clare had vainly tried to persuade 
Dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cook- 
stove. Not she. No Puseyite, or Conservative of any 
school, was ever more inflexibly attached to time-honoured 
inconveniences than Dinah. 

"When St. Clare had first returned from the north, im- 
pressed with the system and order of his uncle's kitchen 
arrangements, he had largely provided his own with an array 
of cupboards, drawers, and various apparatus, to induce 
systematic regulation, under the sanguine illusion that it 
would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her 
arrangements. He might as well have provided them for a 
squirrel or a magpie. The more drawers and closets there 
were, the more hiding-holes could Dinah make for the 
accommodation of old rags, hair-combs, old shoes, ribbons, 
cast-off artificial flowers, and other articles of virtue, wherein 
her soul delighted. 

When Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen, Dinah did not 
rise, but smoked on in sublime tranquillity, regarding her 
movements obliquely out of the corner of her eye, but 
apparently intent only on the operations around her. 

Miss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers. 

" What is this drawer for, Dinah ? " she said. 

" It's handy for most anything, missis," said Dinah. So 
it appeared to be. From the variety it contained, Miss 
Ophelia pulled out first a fine damask table-cloth stained 
with blood, having evidently been used to envelope some 
raw meat. 

" What's this, Dinah ? You don't wrap up meat in your 
mistress's best table-cloths ? " 

" Lor, missis, no ; the towels was all a missin' so 
I jest did it. I laid out to wash that ar that's why I put 
it thar." 

" Shiftless ! " said Miss Ophelia to herself, proceeding to 
tumble over the drawer, where she found a nutmeg-grater 
and two or three nutmegs, a Methodist hymn-book, a couple 
of soiled Madras handkerchiefs, some yarn and knitting 
work, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one or 
two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them, one 
or two thin old shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up 
inclosing some small white onions, several damask table 





napkins, some coarse crash towels, some twine and darning- 
needles, and several broken papers, from which sundry sweet 
herbs were sifting into the drawer. 

" Where do you keep your nutmegs, Dinah ? " said Miss 
Ophelia, with the air of one who prayed for patience. 

" Most anywhar, missis ; there's some in that cracked 
teacup, up there, and there's some over in that ar cupboard." 

" Here are some in the grater," said Miss Ophelia, holding 
them up. , 

" Laws, yes, I put 'em there this morning. I likes to 
keep my things handy," said Dinah. " You, Jake ! what are 
you stopping for! You'll cotch it ! Be still, thar!" she 
added, with a dive of her stick at the criminal. 

" What's this ? " said Miss Ophelia, holding up the saucer 
of pomade. 

"Laws, it's my har grease; I put it thar to have it 
handy." 

" Do you use your mistress's best saucers for that ? " 

" Law ! it was cause I was driv, and in sich a hurry ; I 
was gwine to change it this very day."
