The child clung shyly to 'the woman. 

" Come, Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you 
know that he has got to be kept away from you ? " 

"I know it's foolish," said Eliza, "yet I can't bear to 
have him turn away from me. But come where's my 
cloak ? Here how is it men put on cloaks, George ? " 

" You must wear it so," said her husband, throwing it 
over his shoulders. 

" So then," said Eliza, imitating the motion ; " and I must 
stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy." 

" Don't exert yourself," said George. " There is, now and 
then, a modest young man ; and I think it would be easier 
for you to act that character." 

" And these gloves ! mercy upon us ! " said Eliza, " why, 
my hands are lost in them." 

"I advise you to keep them on pretty strictly," said 
George. " Your little slender paw might bring us all out. 
Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be 
our aunty you mind." 

"I've heard," said Mrs. Smyth, "that there have been 
men down, warning all the packet-captains against a man 
and woman, with a little boy." 

" They have ! " said George. " Well, if we see any such 
people we can tell them." 

A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family 
who had received the fugitives crowded around them with 
farewell greetings. 

The disguises the party had assumed were in accordance 
with the hints of Tom. Loker. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable 
woman from the settlement in Canada, whither they were 
fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the lake to return 
thither, had consented ta appear as the aunt of little Harry ; 





and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to 
remain, the two last days, under her sole charge ; and an 
extra amount of petting, joined to an indefinite amount of 
seed-cakes and candy, had cemented a very close attachment 
on the part of the young gentleman. 

The hack drove to the wharf. The two young men, as 
they appeared, walked up the plank into the boat, Eliza 
gallantly giving her arm to Mrs. Smyth, and George attending 
to their baggage. 

George was standing at the captain's office, settling for 
his party, when he overheard two men talking by his side. 

" I've watched every one that came on board," said one; 
" and I know they're not on this boat." 

The voice was that of the clerk of the boat. The speaker 
whom he addressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, 
with that valuable perseverance which characterise him, 
had come on to Sandusky, seeking whom he might devour. 

" You would scarcely know the woman from a white one," 
said Marks. " The man is a very light mulatto. He has a 
brand in one of his hands." 

The hand with which George was taking the tickets and 
change trembled a little ; but he turned coolly round, fixed 
an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker, and 
walked leisurely toward another part of the boat, where Eliza 
stood waiting for him. 

Mrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of 
the ladies' cabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed 
little girl drew many flattering comments from the 
passengers. 

George had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal, to see Marks walk down the plank to the shore ; 
and drew a long sigh of relief when the boat had put a 
returnless distance between them. 

It was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced 
rippling and sparkling in the sunlight. A fresh breeze blew 
from the shore, and the lordly boat ploughed her way right 
gallantly onward. 

Oh, what an untold world there is in one human heart ! 
Who thought, as George walked calmly up and down the 
deck of the steamer, with his shy companion at his side, of 
all that was burning in his bosom ? The mighty good that 





seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a 
reality ; and he felt a jealous dread every moment of the 
day that something would rise to snatch it from him. 

But the boat swept on hours fleeted, and, at last, clear 
and full rose the blessed English shor,e shores charmed by 
a mighty spell with one touch to dissolve every incantation 
of slavery, no matter in what language pronounced, or by 
what national power confirmed. 

Gleorge and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat neared 
the small town of Amherstberg, in Canada. His breath 
grew thick and short ; a mist gathered before his eyes ; he 
silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his 
arm. The bell rang the boat stopped. Scarcely seeing 
what he did, he looked out his baggage, and gathered his 
little party. The little company were landed on the shore. 
They .stood still till the boat had cleared; and then, with 
tears and embracings, the husband and wife, with their 
wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted up 
their hearts to Grod ! 

" 'T was something like the burst from death to life ; 

From the grave's cerements to the robes of heaven ; 
From sin's dominion, and from passion's strife, 

To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven ; 

Where all the bonds of death and hell are riven, 
And mortal puts on immortality, 
When Mercy's hand hath turned the golden key, 
And Mercy's voice hath said, Eejoice, thy soul is free ! ' " 

The little party were soon guided by Mrs. Smyth to the 
hospitable abode of a good missionary, whom Christian 
charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and 
wandering, who are constantly finding an asylum on this 
shore. 

"Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of free- 
dom ? Is not the sense of liberty a higher and a finer one 
than any of the five ? To move, speak, and breathe, go out 
and come in, unwatched and free from danger ! Who can 
speak the blessings of that rest which conies down on the 
free man's pillow, under laws which ensure to him the rights 
that God has given to man ? How fair and precious to that 
mother was that sleeping child's face, endeared by the 
 





memory of a thousand dangers ! How impossible was it to 
sleep in the exuberant possession of such blessedness ! And
