to mean it. I try to tell myself that I will take the 





child and go away, and crush my own hopes and yearn- 
ings, and give my life to him. But no I cannot, I 
cannot ! It is perfectly futile for me to think of that 
I crave for life, and I cannot give up. There is that 
in me that will never yield, that will take no refusal. 
Sometimes I see myself as a woman of seventy, still 
seeking my life. Do you not realize that? I feel that 
I shall never grow old ! 

"How strange a thing it is, Thyrsis, that you and I, 
who might do so much with so little chance, should have 
no chance at all. I read of other poets and their wives 
at least they managed to have a hut on some hillside, 
and they did not absolutely starve. 

"I am tired now; perhaps I can sleep. But I will 
tell you something, Thyrsis does it sound so very 
foolish? Not only will I never grow old, but I will never 
give up your love! Yes, some day you will find out 
how to seek your vision in spite of the fact that I am 
your wife !" 

8. ANOTHER day, there would be moods of peace, 
and even of merriment ; it was always like putting one's 
hand into a grab-bag, to open a new letter from Cory- 
don. In after years he would read them, and strange 
were the memories they brought ! 

"My Thyrsis," she wrote: "I have been reading a 
story of Heine in ZangwilPs "Dreamers of the Ghetto". 
I did not know about Heine. He loved and married a 
sweet little woman of the people Mathilde who didn't 
appreciate his writings. I am not only going to love 
you, but I am going to appreciate your writings ! Some 
day I am going to be educated and won't it be fine 
when I am educated? 

''I keep very busy, but I have not so much time as I 





had last summer. I live almost all my life in hope the 
present is nothing. I think I get more strength by 
gazing at my baby than in any other way. I wonder 
if I can ever infuse into him my inspiration and my 
desire. It is wonderfully exciting to me to think of 
what a free soul could do, if it possessed my spirit and 
my dreams. Ah, even you don't know ! I smile to my- 
self when I think how surprised you might some day 
be! Oh, my baby, my baby, surely you will not fail 
me little soul that is to be. This is what I say to him, 
and then I squeeze him in ecstasy, and he coughs up his 
milk. Dear funny little thing, that is so pleased with 
a red, white and blue rattle. At present he is grinning 
at it ecstatically and he is truly most horribly cun- 
ning. His favorite expression is 'Ah-boo, ah-boo' ; and 
is not that just too bright? Everybody tries to spoil 
him even a twelve-year-old boy here wanted to kiss 
him. And wonder of wonders, he has two teeth appear- 
ing in his lower gums ! Poor me he bites hard enough 
as he is." 

And then again : 

"My Beloved : I am sitting with my candle once more. 
It is too hot for a lamp. I have been reading 'Paradise 
Lost', and truly I am astonished that it is so beautiful. 
Also I have been reading a book about Unitarianism, and 
I did not know that such things had been written. But 
I think it is hardly worth while to call one's self a 
Unitarian. I was thinking that I will go back and read 
the Bible through. I would not mind, if I knew I did 
not have to believe it. 

"Also', this week, I read 'Paul and Virginia*. Oh, 
do not write anything to me about our meeting, until 
you are sure it can be ! It breaks my heart. 

"Did it ever occur to you that we might embark 





for the tropics? We'd have a hut, and I might learn to 
raise fruits and vegetables. I sigh for some verdant 
isle and I am not joking. We might find some place 
where steamers came now and then, and some one in 
New York coul$ attend to your manuscripts. 

"To-night I was trying to put my baby to sleep and 
he wouldn't go, but just lay in my lap and kicked and 
grinned. I tried to coax him to go to sleep, but if I 
was the least bit impatient he'd begin to cry. And 
then he'd grin at me so roguishly, as if to say, 'Let's 
play before I go to sleep !' Finally I looked right at 
him and said, 'Now, you have played long enough, and 
I wish you to be a good boy and g'o to sleep !' And 
then he laughed, and I put him on his side and he went 
to sleep! Wasn't that bright for a baby just seven 
months old? 

"I think I write you much more interesting letters 
than you write me. To be sure I have no books into 
which to put my thoughts. Also, I have a great deal 
of time to compose letters to you ; Cedric wakes me up 
so much in the night, and often I cannot go to sleep 
again. It plays havoc with me as a rule ; and yet 
sometimes, when I'm not too exhausted, there is a certain 
joy in watching by the dim candle light the rosy up- 
turned face and the little groping mouth. Oh Thyrsis, 
he is all mine and yours, and we must make him glad 
he was borned, mustn't we?" 

9. SUCH letters would come at a time when Thyrsis 
was almost prostrated with exhaustion ; and great waves 
of loneliness and yearning would sweep over him. Ah 
God, what a fate it was to labor as he labored, and 
then to have no means of recreation or respite, no hand 





to smooth his forehead, no voice to whisper solace! 
Who could know the tragedy of that aspect of his life ? 

There came one day an incident that almost broke 
his heart. Down the lake came a private yacht, beauti- 
ful and swift, clean as a new penny, its bronze and white 
paint glistening in the sunlight. It anchored not far 
out from the point where Thyrsis camped, and a boat 
put off, and from it three young girls stepped ashore. 
They were slender and graceful, clad all in white as 
spotless as the vessel itself, and glowing with health 
and joyfulness. They cast shy glances at the tent, and 
asked Thyrsis to direct them to the nearest farm-house ; 
he watched them disappear through the woods, and saw 
them return with a basket of fruit. 

It was just at sunset, and there was a new moon in 
the sky, and the evening star trembled upon the bosom 
of the waters. There in the magic stillness lay the 
vessel and suddenly came the sounds of a guitar, and 
of young voices singing. Wonderful to tell, they sang 
not "ragtime" and "college songs," but the chorus 
of the "Rheintochter," and Schubert's "Auf dem Was- 
ser zu singen", and other music, unknown to Thyrsis, 
exquisite almost beyond enduring. It pierced him to 
the heart ; he sat with his hands clenched, and every 
nerve of him a-quiver, and the hot tears raining down 
his cheeks. It was loveliness not of this earth, it was an
