as a surprise each time. The war-cloud hanging black over 
England and America made no trouble for me. I was a 
prospective prisoner of war, but at dinners, suppers, on the 
platform, and elsewhere, there was never anything to remind 
me of it. This was hospitality of the right metal, and would 
have been prominently lacking in some countries, in the cir- 
cumstances. 

And speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring 
to light the unexpected, in a detail or two. It seemed to rele- 
gate the war-talk to the politicians on both sides of the water ; 
whereas whenever a prospective war between two nations had 
been in the air theretofore, the public had done most of the 
talking and the bitterest. The attitude of the newspapers was 
new also. I speak of those of Australasia and India, for I 
had access to those only. They treated the subject argumenta- 
tively and with dignity, not with spite and anger. That was 
a new spirit, too, and not learned of the French and German 
press, either before Sedan or since. I heard many public 



speeches, and they reflected the moderation of the journals. 
The outlook is that the English-speaking race will dominate 
the earth a hundred years from now, if its sections do not get 
to fighting each other. It would be a pity to spoil that pras- 
pect by baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would 
settle their differences so much better and also so much more 
definitely. 

No, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great cap- 
itals of modern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne 
could not be told from the familiar stock exchange of other 
countries. Wool brokers are just like stockbrokers ; they all 
bounce from their seats and put up their hands and yell in 
unison — no stranger can tell what — and the president calmly 
says — " Sold to Smith & Co., threppence farthing — next ! " — 
when probably nothing of the kind happened ; for how should 
he know ? 

In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and 
fascinating things ; but all museums are fascinating, and they 
do so tire your eyes, and break your back, and burn out your 
vitalities with their consuming interest. You always say you 
will never go again, but you do go. The palaces of the rich, 
in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the rich in America, 
and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblance 
ends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not 
often large, and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case 
the grounds are often ducally spacious, and the climate and 
the gardeners together make them as beautiful as a dream. It 
is said that some of the country seats have grounds — domains 
— about them which rival in charm and magnitude those which 
surround the country mansion of an English lord ; but I was 
not out in the country ; I had my hands full in town. 

And what was the origin of this majestic city and its 
efflorescence of palatial town houses and country seats ? Its 

first brick was laid and its first house built by a passing convict. 
Australian history is almost always picturesque ; indeed, it 
is so curious and strange, that it is itself the chiefest novelty the 
country has to offer, and so it pushes the other novelties into 
second and third place. It does not read like history, but like 
the most beautiful lies. And all of a fresh new sort, no mouldy 
old stale ones. It is full of surprises, and adventures, and 
incongruities, and contradictions, and incredibilities ; but they 
are all true, they all happened. 





CHAPTER XVIL 

The English are mentioned in the Bible : Blessed are the meek, for they shall 
inherit the earth. — Puddri'Tiead Wilson's New Calendar. 

WHEN we consider the immensity of the British Empire 
in territory, population, and trade, it requires a stern 
exercise of faith to believe in the figures which 
represent Australasia's contribution to the Empire's commercial 
grandeur. As compared with the landed estate of the British 
Empire, the landed estate dominated by any other Power 
except one — Russia — is not very impressive for size. My 
authorities make the British Empire not much short of a 
fourth larger than the Russian Empire. Roughly pro- 
portioned, if you will allow your entire hand to represent 
the British Empire, you may then cut off the fingers a trifle 
above the middle joint of the middle finger, and what is left 
of the hand will represent Russia. The populations ruled by 
Great Britain and China are about the same — 400,000,000 
each. No other Power approaches these figures. Even 
Russia is left far behind. 

The population of Australasia — 4,000,000 — sinks into 
nothingness, and is lost from sight in that British ocean of 
400,000,000. Yet the statistics indicate that it rises again and 
shows up very conspicuously when its share of the Empire's 
commerce is the matter under consideration. The value of 
England's annual exports and imports is stated at three 
billions of dollars,* and it is claimed that more than one-tenth 
of this great aggregate is represented by Australasia's exports 
to England and imports from England.* In addition to this, 
Australasia does a trade with countries other than England, 
amounting to a hundred million dollars a year, and a domestic 
intercolonial trade amounting to a hundred and fifty millions.* 

In round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about $600,- 
000,000 worth of goods a year. It is claimed that about half 
of this represents commodities of Australasian production. 
The products exported annually by India are worth a trifle over 
$500,000,000. t Now, here are some faith-straining figures: 

Indian production (300,000,000 population), $500,000,000. 

Australasian production (4,000,000 population), $300,000,000. 

That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, 
annually (for export some whither), is worth $1.75 ; that of the 
individual Australasian (for export some whither), $75 ! Or, 
to put it in another way, the Indian family of man and wife 
and three children sends away an annual result worth $8.75, 
while the Australasian family sends away $375 worth. 

There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Eichard 
Temple and others, which show that the individual Indian's 
whole annual product, both for export and home use, is worth 
in gold only $7.50 ; or, $37.50 for the family -aggregate. 
Ciphered out on a like ratio of multiplication, the Australasian 
family's aggregate production would be nearly $1,600. Truly, 
nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once get started. 

We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the 
vast Province of South Australia — a seventeen-hour ex- 
cursion. On the train we found several Sydney friends ; among 
them a Judge who was going out on circuit, and was going to 
hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver mine is. 
It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region. Broken 
Hill is close to the western border of New South "Wales, and 
Sydney is on the eastei-n border. A fairly straight line, 700 

miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would strike Broken 
Hill, just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston 
would strike Buffalo. The way the Judge was traveling would 
carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said ; southwest from 
Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide, 
then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New 
South Wales once more — to Broken Hill. It was like going 
from Boston southwest to Richmond, Virginia, then northwest 
up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over 
the border — to Buffalo, New York. 

But the explanation was simple. Years ago the fabulously 
rich silver discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an 
unexpectant world. Its stocks started at shillings, and went 
by leaps and bounds to the most fanciful figures. It was one of 
those cases where the cook puts a month's wages into shares, 
and comes next month and buys your house at your own 
price, and moves into it herself ; where the coachman takes a
