his father's partnership in an old business firm that was 
equivalent to a fortune. Tom was gay, a charming good 
fellow, much sought after, easy, pleasure-loving, generous 

to a fault, and a delightful companion in prosperity. If 
all goes smoothly with men of this type they command 
admiration on the right hand and on the left, but in 
adversity they betray a fatal lack of the grand and sturdy 
strength that buffets through storms. 

They lived in an open-handed, delightful manner. Mrs. 
Marshall gave the most elegant little dinners, the daintiest 
of high teas, with now and then a musicale, or a compli- 
mentary reception to some friend going abroad or return- 
ing home. Two pretty little girls were added to the 
family, then two boys. 

The winter of Bertie's birth was an especially hard one. 
Old Mr. Deering of the firm died, and, when affairs came 
to be settled and his money withdrawn, the younger mem- 
bers looked aghast at each other. They had all been liv- 
ing extravagantly, and two or three heavy losses followed 
this misfortune. Friends who were appealed to shook 
their heads dubiously, and deemed it a sinking ship. Tom 
applied to his sister, but Mrs. Vanduyne was too prudent 
to risk her money, and it would have proved of no avail 
if she had ; so the firm gave up business honorably. 

Tom accepted a position until he should find a new 
opening. His expensive habits clung to him ; indeed, he 
thought it hard enough to give up all the rest. There 
were champagne suppers and various divertisements. 
Then his eldest boy died, and Tom plunged more deeply 
into amusements to drown his grief. 

The next year they took a smaller house, and Eleanor 
dispensed with her trusty nurse and kept a young girl in 
her place. Bertie's birth and the sickness and death of 
the other child had confined her closely, and now she 
began to note with dismay that Tom never stayed at home 
evenings. She exerted herself to the utmost ; she wore her 
pretty dresses, she played and sang; but that was not it. 
He wanted the excitement of crowds and jollity. His 
gay, good humor gave way to impatience, depression, and 




he had recourse to stimulants long before Eleanor became 
aware of his true state. Through carelessness he lost his 
position and was out of employment. Business men be- 
gan to look askance at him and put him off with excuses. 
"Luck was against him," he said. 

When Eleanor found unpaid bills accumulating, she 
asked herself seriously if there was nothing she could do. 
There was music-teaching, she might get a few scholars ; 
but if she could make the home brighter and pleasanter 
for Tom, and keep him in it, — for she began to have a 
strange and sickening fear concerning him. So she 
opened her house and took in a young married couple to 
board. They were gay and charming, but it did not seem 
to win Tom back to a love for home. Indeed, he often 
accepted the Gedneys' invitation to the theatre or some 
little company when she could not go. 

Then her eyes were opened rudely. Thomas Marshall 
was discharged for drunkenness and insolence. He came 
home to his wife at midnight in a terrible state, and 
Eleanor went almost crazy. When he recovered he 
upbraided himself fiercely, and called himself all the 
monsters in the world. If Nelly only would forgive 

him! 

She forgave him and loved him, and learned to think of 
him pityingly. She tried to be strong for both, to rouse 
and inspire him; but he was a slave to the fatal weakness. 
With a wife's faith and enthusiasm she blamed the mis- 
fortunes, the world, the friends who no longer stood 
ready to help, and with the utmost loyalty clung to him. 
She felt then that she must be the bread-winner until bet- 
ter times, and filled her house with boarders, for she was 
much too proud to complain to Aunt Clara. The defec- 
tion of friends was borne bravely, sacrifices were made 
without a murmur. She prayed, she counselled, she 
pleaded, and it seemed as if her faith might almost 
inspire the dead; but presently her soul took in the sad, 



 

desolating truth, that her husband was not trying as a 
man should try in so great a strait. She importuned no 
more for promises, though she endeavored in every other 
way to rouse him. Was there some fatal weakness in 
the man? 

By slow degrees she found her position much changed. 
Old friends went in other directions, or, when they met, 
gave her a kind of patronizing sympathy that cut to the 
quick. The style of her boarders became different. The 
refined and courteous gentlemen gave way to a lower 
grade, not absolutely uncultured, but of the jolly, indif- 
ferent type. Tom took the head of the table, sometimes 
in a captious state, where he was loud and insolent, some- 
times, which was much worse to bear, foolishly maudlin 
with an unmeaning smile upon his flushed face. O 
Heaven ! could she parade the shame to strange eyes ? 

Two cruel wounds came to her presently. A Mr. 
Westlake, a plain, kindly man, was going West on some 
business and might possibly remain. Tom confessed to 
his wife that he had two or three times borrowed a little 
change from him and he would like Eleanor to pay it. 

"You borrowed money from him?" she asked in her 
clear, incisive tone, while a scarlet spot burned on her 
cheek. " How much ? " 

"I don't remember. You needn't be so confounded 
sharp about it ! He'sa good fellow, and he said it didn't 
make any difference." 

"Next time come to me for money." Her heart 
swelled in secret shame, and she sought out Mr. West- 
lake, stumbling through a most mortifying explanation. 

" It doesn't matter, Mrs. Marshall. I never meant to 
mention it when I found — when he — please let it go." 

" No, Mr. Westlake, if you are the true friend I take 
you to be, you cannot refuse me the honesty of paying 
this debt, which is as sacred to me as if I had borrowed 
it." 





Westlake searched his memorandum. He hated dread- 
fully to take the money from her. Most of it had been 
borrowed months ago, before he understood Mr. Mar- 
shall's devious ways. 

" I wish you 'd let it go ! " in a voice of entreaty. 

" I cannot," she answered firmly. 

"Well — altogether it is twenty-three dollars." He 
did not dare falsify with her clear eyes upon him, but for 
all that she wrung the truth out of him reluctantly". 

Mrs. Marshall paid the bill, and Mr. Westlake bade 
her a kindly good-by, his soul deeply moved to pity. 

Was there anyone else? she wondered. 

She asked her husband that evening. He shambled
