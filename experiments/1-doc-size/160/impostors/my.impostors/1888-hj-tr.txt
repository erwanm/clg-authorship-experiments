"I told him everything it s all me, me, ME I" 
the girl replied, exaltedly, without pretending to 
hesitate an instant as to what he might mean. 

Gaston looked at her with deep eyes ; then he 
walked straight away to the window and remained 
there in silence. Francie said nothing more. 
At last the young man went on, " And I who 
insisted to them that there was no natural 
delicacy like yours ! " 

" Well, you 'll never need to insist about any 
thing any more ! " she cried. And with this she 
dashed out of the room by the nearest door. When 
Delia and Mr. Dosson returned the red salon was 
empty and Francie was again locked into her 
room. But this time her sister forced an entrance. 



XIII. 

MR. DOSSON, as we know, was meditative, and 
the present occasion could only minister to that 
side of his nature, especially as, so far at least as 
the observation of his daughters went, it had not 
urged him into uncontrollable movement. But 
the truth is that the intensity, or rather the con 
tinuity, of his meditations did engender an act 
which was not perceived by these young ladies, 
though its consequences presently became definite 
enough. While he waited for the Proberts to 
arrive in a phalanx and noted that they failed to do 
so he had plenty of time to ask himself and also 
to ask Delia questions about Mr. Flack. So far 
as they were addressed to his daughter they were 
promptly answered, for Delia had been ready from 
the first, as we have seen, to pronounce upon the 
conduct of the young journalist. Her view of it 
was clearer every hour ; there was a difference 
however in the course of action which she judged 
this view to demand. At first he was to be blown 







up for the mess he had got them into (profitless as 
the process might be and vain the satisfaction) ; 
he was to be visited with the harshest chastise 
ment that the sense of violated confidence could 
inflict. Now he was simply to be dropped, to be 
cut, to be let alone to his dying day : the girl 
quickly recognised that this was a much more dis 
tinguished way of showing displeasure. It was in 
this manner that she characterised it, in her 
frequent conversations with her father, if that can 
be called conversation which consisted of his 
serenely smoking while she poured forth argu 
ments which combined both variety and repetition. 
The same cause will produce consequences tho 
most diverse : a truth according to which the 
catastrophe that made Delia express freely the 
hope that she might never again see so much as 
the end of Mr. Flack s nose had just the opposite 
effect upon her father. The one thing he wanted 
positively to do at present was to let his eyes 
travel over his young friend s whole person : it 
seemed to him that that would really make him 
feel better. If there had been a discussion about 
this the girl would have kept the field, for she had 
the advantage of being able to tell her reasons, 
whereas her father could not have put his into 
words. Delia had touched on her deepest con 
viction in saying to Francie that the correspondent 
of the Reverberator had played them that trick 
on purpose to get them into such trouble with the 







Proberts that he might see his own hopes bloom 
again under cover of their disaster. This had 
many of the appearances of a strained interpreta 
tion, but that did not prevent Delia from placing 
it before her father several times an hour. It 
mattered little that he should remark, in return, 
that he didn 't see what good it could do Mr. Flack 
that Francie and he and Delia, for all he could 
guess should be disgusted with him : to Mr. 
Dosson s mind that was such a queer way of 
reasoning. Delia maintained that she understood 
perfectly, though she couldn 't explain and at any 
rate she didn 't want the manoeuvring creature to 
come flying back from Nice. She didn 't want 
him to know that there had been a scandal, that 
they had a grievance against him, that any one 
had so much as heard of his article or cared what 
he published or didn 't publish : above all she 
didn 't want him to know that the Proberts had 
cooled off. Mixed up with this high rigour on 
Miss Dosson s part was the oddest secret com 
placency of reflection that in consequence of what 
Mr. Flack had published the great American 
community was in a position to know with what 
fine folks Francie and she were associated. She 
hoped that some of the people who used to call on 
them when they were " off to-morrow " would take 
the lesson to heart. 

While she glowed with this consolation as well 
as with the resentment for which it was required 







her father quietly addressed a few words, by 
letter, to George Flack. This communication 
was not of a minatory order; it expressed 
on the contrary the loose sociability which was 
the essence of Mr. Dosson s nature. He wanted 
to see Mr. Flack, to talk the whole thing over, 
and the desire to hold him to an account would 
play but a small part in the interview. It was 
much more definite to him that the soreness of 
the Proberts was a kind of unexpected insanity 
(so little did his experience match it), than that 
a newspaper-man had misbehaved in trying to 
turn out an attractive article. As the newspaper 
man happened to be the person with whom he 
had most consorted for some time back he felt 
drawn to him in the presence of a new problem, 
and somehow it did not seem to Mr. Dosson to 
disqualify him as a source of comfort that it was 
just he who had been the fountain of injury. 
The injury was a sort of emanation of the crazy 
Proberts. Moreover Mr. Dosson could not dislike 
at such short notice, a man who had smoked 
so many of his cigars, ordered so many of his 
dinners and helped him so loyally to spend his 
money : such acts constituted a bond, and when 
there was a bond people gave it a little jerk 
in time of trouble. His letter to Nice was the 
little jerk. 

The morning after Francie had turned her back 
on Gaston and left him planted in the salon (he
