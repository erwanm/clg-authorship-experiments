so fine. The Lady was pleased with the church, but 
yet she had not said she would stay all winter; we 
were still anxious. How she preached to us that 
day ! We had made a screen of young spruces set 
in boxes, and her figure stood out against the dark 



 

green background like a thing of light. Her silvery 
voice rang through the log-temple, her face seemed 
to us like a star. She had no color in her cheeks 
at any time ; her dress, too, was colorless. Although 
gentle, there was an iron inflexibility about her slight, 
erect form. We felt, as we saw her standing there, 
that if need be she would walk up to the lion's 
jaws, the cannon's mouth, with a smile. She took a 
little book from her pocket and read to us a hymn, 
' O come, all ye faithful,' the old ' Adeste Fideles.' 
Some of us knew it; she sang, and gradually, shame- 
facedly, voices joined in. It was a sight to see 
Nightingale Jack solemnly singing away about / choirs 
of angels'; but it was a treat to hear him, too, 
what a voice he had ! Then our Lady prayed, kneel- 
ing down on the little platform in front of the ever- 
greens, clasping her hands, and lifting her eyes to 
heaven. We did not know what to do at first, but 
the Doctor gave us a severe look and bent his head, 
and we all followed his lead. 

" When service was over and the door opened, we 
found that it had been snowing ; we could not see out 
through the windows because white cloth was nailed 
over them in place of glass. 

" ' Now, my Lady, you will have to stay with us,' said 
the Doctor. We all gathered around with eager faces. 

" ' Do you really believe that it will be for the good 
of your souls ? ' asked the sweet voice. 



 

The Doctor believed for us all. 

" ' Do you really hope ? ' 

" The Doctor hoped. 

" ' "Will you try to do your best ? ' 

" The Doctor was sure he would. 

" ' I will,' answered the Flying Dutchman, earnest- 
ly. 'I moost not fry de meat any more; I moost 
broil ! ' 

" For we had begged him for months to broil, and 
he had obstinately refused ; broil represented the good, 
and fry the evil, to his mind; he came out for the 
good according to his light ; but none the less did we 
fall upon him behind the Lady's back, and cuff him 
into silence. 

"She stayed with us all winter. You don't know 
what the winters are up here ; steady, bitter coM for 
seven months, thermometer always below, the snow 
dry as dust, the air like a knife. We built a com- 
pact chimney for our Lady, and we cut cords of wood 
into small, light sticks, easy for her to lift, and stacked 
them in her shed ; we lined her lodge with skins, and 
we made oil from bear's fat and rigged up a kind of 
lamp for her. We tried to make candles, I remember, 
but they would not run straight ; they came out hump- 
backed and sidling, and burned themselves to wick in 
no time. Then we took to improving the town. We 
had lived in all kinds of huts and lean-to shanties ; 
now nothing would do but regular log-houses. If it 



 

had been summer, I don't know what we might not 
have run to in the way of piazzas and fancy steps ; 
but with the snow five feet deep, all we could accom- 
plish was a plain, square log-house, and even that took 
our whole force. The only way to keep the peace was 
to have all the houses exactly alike ; we laid out the 
three streets, and built the houses, all facing the 
meeting-house, just as you found them." 

" And where was the Lady's lodge ? " I asked, for I 
recalled no stockaded fortress, large or small. 

My companion hesitated a moment. Then he said 
abruptly, " It was torn down." 

" Torn down ! " I repeated. " Why, what " 

Keufren waved his hand with a gesture that silenced 
me, and went on with his story. It came to me then 
for the first time, that he was pursuing the current 
of his own thoughts rather than entertaining me. I 
turned to look at him with a new interest. I had 
talked to him for two weeks, in rather a patronizing 
way; could it be that affairs were now, at this last 
moment, reversed? 

" It took us almost all winter to build those houses," 
pursued Eeuben. "At one time we neglected the 
hunting and trapping to such a degree, that the Doc- 
tor called a meeting and expressed his opinion. Ours 
was a voluntary camp, in a measure, but still we had 
formally agreed to get a certain amount of skins ready 
for the bateaux by early spring; this agreement was 



 

about the only real bond of union between us. Those 
whose houses were not completed scowled at the 
Doctor. 

" ' Do you suppose I 'm going to live like an Injun 
when the other fellows has regular houses ? ' inquired 
Black Andy, with a menacing air. 

" ' By no means,' replied the Doctor, blandly. ' My 
plan is this: build at night.' 

"'At night?' 

" ' Yes ; by the light of pine fires.' 

" We did. After that, we faithfully went out hunt- 
ing and trapping as long as daylight lasted, and then, 
after supper, we built up huge fires of pine logs, 
and went to work on the next house. It was a 
strange picture: the forest deep in snow, black with 
night, the red glow of the great fires, and our mov- 
ing figures working on as complacently as though 
daylight, balmy air, and the best of tools were ours. 

" The Lady liked our industry. She said our new 
houses showed that the 'new cleanliness of our inner 
man required a cleaner tabernacle for the outer.' I 
don't know about our inner man, but our outer was 
certainly much cleaner. 

"One day the Flying Dutchman made one of his 
unfortunate remarks. 'De boys t'inks you 'll like 
dern better in nize houses,' he announced when, hap- 
pening to pass the fortress, he found the Lady stand- 
ing at her gate gazing at the work of the preceding
