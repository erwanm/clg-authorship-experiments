manding a merchant vessel, which was anchored further 
down the river. An elderly negro immediately took me 
before him on horseback â€” a new and most delightful way 
of travelling to me, and carried me down the river's bank 
to where the beautiful vessel lay at anchor. I was carried 
on board, and we soon set sail. 

My fortune had now taken the most favorable turn ; I 
had a hammock, in which I slept, and had plenty to eat 
and drink ; every one on board treated me kindly, very 
differently from any of the other whites whom I had seen, 
and I began to think that they were not all of the same 
stamp. I had already learnt a few words of Enghsh, and 
after we had been several days upon the sea, I inquired of 
one and another where we were going. Some told me, either 
to make sport of me or from a desire to please me, that 
they were going to take me to my home ; this gave me the 




greatest delight ; I thought over all the wondrous things I 
should have to relate to my father and mother. But I 
was soon undeceived and learned that we were sailing for 
England, the birth place of my master. He named me 
Gustavus Vasa, and although I remonstrated as well as I 
could, and told him that I wished to he called Jacob as 
before, he told me shortly that it was to be as he said, and 
always called me Gustav. At first I pretended not to 
hear and thus suffered many a box on the ear, but at last 
I reconciled myself to being called Gustav. 

The ship was delayed by contrary winds and the voyage 
wan uncommonly long ; of course the rations grew smaller, 
and at last each man was restricted to a pound and a half 
of bread, about as much meat, and a can of water. The 
whole time that we were at sea we saw no other vessel, 
and only once caught a few fish. Some of the sailors and 
the captain said to me in joke, that they should have to kill 
Rnd eat me, and in my simplicity, I took it all for earnest ; 
grew very melancholy, and feared that each moment would 
be my last. While I was in this distress the sailors caught 
a large fish, and I was delighted, for I felt sure that they 
would eat it before they killed me; but to my consterna- 
tion, they only cut off a piece of the tail, and threw the 
fish back into the water. I was now more anxious than 
ever; I was indeed afraid that these whites, whom I could 
not understand, wpuld kill and eat me. 

There was on board a young man about four years older 
than I, named Eichard. He was an American by birth, had 
been very well educated, and was of a most amiable dispo- 
sition. Before I had been many days on- board he showed 


quite a liking for me, and I became very warmly attached 
to him. The friendship commenced on this voyage con- 
tinued as long as we knew each other, and never can I 
forget the faithful friend who, at the age of fifteen, pos- 
sessed a soul superior to prejudice, and did not disdain to 
be the teacher and companion of a poor ignorant negro 
slave. 

Once a man fell overboard in the night, and as they 
stopped the vessel, such a noise and confusion ensued that 
my great terror returned; as I ceuld not understand what 
was going on, I felt convinced that they were about to 
sacrifice me to the spirit of the wavys, which were very 
high and stormy, for I could never believe that these 
whites were not arch-magicians. I did not close my eyes 
through the whole night, and although I was somewhat 
relieved when the daylight appeared, yet when ever I waa 
called, I imagined that I must prepare for death. 

Soon afterwards we met several very large fishes, which, 
as I afterwards learned, were called whales ; as it was just 
beginning to grow dark when they came in sight, they 
looked particularly frightful as they spouted up the water 
so that the deck was sprinkled. I believed them to be the 
rulers of the sea, and angry that the white men had made 
no sacrifice. I was strengthened in this belief by a sudden 
lull in the wind, which I was sure was occasioned by the 
fishes, and fearing lest I should be immediately sacrificed, I 
concealed myself on, the forward deck. My friend Richard 
soon came to find me, and I asked him what those fishes 
were, and what they wanted. As my English was very 
imperfect T could scarcely make myself intelligible to him; 



still less could he comprehend me when I asked whether 
they were about to offer a sacrifice to the fishes; he told 
me that these fishes could easily swallow a man, and this 
was enough to terrify me almost to death. Before I could 
procure any further information the captain called Richard, 
and they stood talking and looking at the fishes, while the 
crew were busied setting fire to a tar barrel, which they 
were going to throw out to the fishes for sport. Eichard 
told the captain of the fright I was in, and I was called, 
trembling and weeping, firmly convinced that my last hour 
was at hand. They made game of me and my terrors for 
a while, and then let me go, and threw the burning barrel 
into the water; as it was a very dark night the fishes 
were attracted by the blazing light, and to my unspeaka- 
ble joy we saw no more of them.

My fears entirely vanished when at last, after a tedious 
voyage of thirteen weeks, we came in sight of land, and 
anchored at Falmouth. All on board rejoiced, and cer- 
tainly, no one more than I. The captain immediately went 
ashore and sent us fresh provisions, which we were really 
in need of. We fell to without delay, and a long feast 
succeeded our weary fast. 

IV. 

When I arrived in England I was twelve years old ; I 
beheld with astonishment the large buildings and paved 
streets of Falmouth ; every thing that I saw increased my 
wonder. One morning when I went on deck I found it 
covered with Vhite spots ; as I had never seen any thing 
like it before. I ran to the helmsman and informed him that 



during the night some one had strewn the deck with salt. 
He immediately perceived my ridiculous mistake, and 
asked me to bring him some of the salt. I gathered a 
handful of it, but felt a strange sensation of cold, and 
when he asked me to taste of it, my amazement exceeded 
all bounds. I asked him what it was, but could not under- 
stand when he told me snow. He inquired if we had not 
the same in our country ; I said no, and curiously asked 
who made it ; he replied that a great man in heaven, called 
Ood, made it, and I was again puzzled and in the dark, 
 especially as I now saw the whole air filled with the white 
fQOw flakes. 

Some days after our arrival, I went with several of the 
crew to church, and as I had never been in such a place 
before, my curiosity dnd wonder was unbounded. I asked 
ftbout every thing as well as I could, and was told that 
liere the God who made us and all things, was worshipped. 
t asked a thousand questions, but most of them were unin- 
telligible, or so strange that they could not be answered. 
My friend Eichard always understood me best, as well 
because I spoke to him freely and without fear, as because 
he explained every thing to me simply and with the great- 
est pleasure. What he told me about this God pleased 
me much, as far as I could understand it ; but I was par- 
ticularly pleased to see that these white people did not 
buy and sell each other, as is the custom with us blacks, 
and I concluded that in this respect they were much hap- 
pier than the negroes. The superior understanding of the 
whites, which did not escape me, filled me with admira- 
tion, and great was my astonishment when I saw that they 



never offered sacrifices to their God, and ate with unwashed
