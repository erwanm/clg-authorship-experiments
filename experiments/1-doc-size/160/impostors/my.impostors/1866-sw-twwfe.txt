" Of that day and that hour knoweth no man.' It may 
come to-morrow. And if those I love were all ready for it 
I wish it would ! " 

" But, uncle Sam," I ventured, " won't it be a dreadful 
day?" 

" When Jesus comes ? Not to those that love His appearing, Tiny. That will not be the day that the world will be 
burned up — there will be a long space between ; but whether 
Christ comes to the world, or death takes us to Him, in 
either case our part and lot in the transactions of that last 
great day will be equally fixed and settled beforehand." 
 , " Uncle Sam," said Eliphalet, " how do you suppose all 
the animals were got into the ark ? " 

" How do you suppose they were got into the garden of 
Eden?" 

" O sir," said Liph—" if you mean a miracle" 



 

''I do not mean anything," said my nnde. "If you can 
make anything but a miracle out of it, you are welcome." 

" Uncle Sam," said I, " how high is Mount Ararat ? " 

" How shall I tell yon, Tiny  I told yon, you would 
not be able to imagine it. The glory of it is, that it sprmgs 
right up from the plain, almost alone, instead of being surrounded with other high grounds which would half conceal 
it. Right up from the plain, more than fourteen thousand 
feet ; a beautiful great cone, with its head in eternal snow, 
and a crown of glittering ice on its brow, that shines in the 
blue heaven in the sunlight like a crown of glory. I have 
seen it from different quarters, near and far off; always the 
same regular white cone, in solitary height and majesty, with 
its glittering ice diadeuL I do think it is the most beautiful 
mountain in the world." 

" Is it a volcano, sir ? " 

" The whole land of Armenia is volcanic ; that is, it was 
thrown up at some time by volcanic action ; and Ararat 
seems to have been once a volcano itself ; for below the 
region of snows on its head, there is a barren terrible tract 
covered with great masses of lava and cinders and porphjrry. 
However, within the memory of man there has never been 
an eruption there, nor tradition of such a thing. I suppose, 
if the mountain was ever at work, it has not been since 
Noah's time. It is thought that a great cleft on the north 
side may be the token of a former crater. A village used to 
stand there a few years ago, until a terrible earthquake shook 
down such masses of rock and rubbish from the upper part 
of the mountain, that the village was buried. The principal 
shock happened in the day time, so that but some fifty lives 
were lost. But there were clouds of smoke and a strong 
smell of sulphur about, after the earthquake, which spoke 
for the old character of the mountain." 

" It is time to go into the house, children," said my grand- 
mother. 

"One minute, ma'am," said Priscilla, "Uncle Sam, do 
you know what gopher-toood is ? " 

"It is cypress- wood my dear, I believe the same wood 
 

which the ancient Phoenicians used for their ship-building. 
It is both light and durable, and grows in those regions of 
Asia." 

"How beautiful this talk about Noah and Ararat has 
been !" I said, as uncle Sam put me down from his knee. He 
stooped down and kissed me. 

" But remember the other Day, Tiny, and the Ark. ' A 
prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself.' '' 






Sept. 9.— SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH, 

Ajteb a morning of business we had oar dinner out in the 
woods again ; uncle Sam this time taking with him one or 
two books, which as the boys said looked like work. To-day 
we changed our place, and went a little farther, to the top 
of a spreading rock which gave us a most beautiful view 
through one of the forest glades, with a blue mountain 
rising up far in the distance. The rock was warm with the 
uninterrupted rays of the sun ; and the moss gray and crisp 
as if it had been dried. We found a shelter  some 
scrubby pines which had foliage enough to serve ilB for a 
canopy ; and though uncle Sam declared that the xock was 
hard, I think he liked it as well as we did. Grandtiiamma 
had a carpet of shawls to sit upon and the trunk Cff a pine- 
tree to lean against ; and I cannot tell how beautiful the 
lights were across the grassy glade below and upoa ttue faint 
blue mountain far away. 

" How far is it, uncle Sam ? " the boys asked. 

" That mountain ? " said my uncle. " It must be at least 
seventy miles away. So events look to us throught  distance of ages. We get the outline — we get a notion cC their 
greatness — but the features of the case, the lights and 
colours, are all faded away in the undistinguishable vast of 
the space between."  

" Does the Flood look so to us, uncle Sam ?"

" Ay, Tiny ! We read it like a story that has grown cold 
with telling. We hardly see any of its features. Imagine 
that this was the time of the Flood; and that we were 
gathered on this high place as the nearest point of safety ; 
and that over that lower ground, and between us and yonder 
blue mountain, all over, there was a heaving tide of water; 




coming in from we could not tell where, and growing, growing, higher and higher, creeping up the sides of our rock, 
and np the stems of the forest trees. Suppose we had been 
here two days already, with scarce any food; and while 
watching for our lives to see whether the water would goin 
to go down, we could only see that it was constantly, 
steadily creeping up. And suppose that, away in the distance, we could see the fioatmg ark ; carrying off its little 
company in the safety which we had ref usckI to share." 

''I wish you would not talk about it, uncle Sam," I 
said. 

" Now we look back at it as we look at that blue moim- 
tain. Only it is like a mountain which can be seen from 
every part of the world. From every part of the world men 
look back at it ; through more and less mist of the atmosphere through which they look." 

" From every part of the world?"  said liph. 

" From every quarter of the world. Do you think such a 
thing would be forgotten by Noah's children ? But as they 
wandered away from other truths, so they lost a great deal 
of this. It is just the distant blue mountain. As you might 
expect, the people who live near the spot where the ark 
rested, have kept the clearest traditions of the matter. They 
all say Armenia was the place. But Noah goes under all 
sorts of names. 

"For instance. One of the best traditions is the Chaldean. An old historian of that nation gives it in this 
way : There was a king of Babylon, the tenth king, called 
Xisuthrus. The god .Kronos told him that on such a day 
a flood would come which would destroy the earth. So he 
bade Xisuthrus build a vessel, stock it with provisions, fill 
it with animals, and take on board all the people that he 
cared about; which Xisuthrus did. He built a ship three
