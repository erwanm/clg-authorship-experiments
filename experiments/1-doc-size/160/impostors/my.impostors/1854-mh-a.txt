theirs in the long run.' Those were your very words--deny them if you
can, or that you were ridiculing them. You are, like myself, more than
a Sabbath-day's journey from being a Christian; and you assert that
they are not much better off. The plain English of which is, that you
are consistent to your professions;--they say they believe one thing,
and practise the opposite. Pretending to despise the vanities of this
life, they pursue them more eagerly than the things which are unseen
and eternal. If a man unites himself with the church, let him live as
if he were changed. I go to the theatre, although I do not consider it
the best school of morals one can frequent; but it grieves me to see,
in my neighbor, a so-called pious man. I am ashamed for him--my respect
for the reputation of his church is greater than his. I dance--and
sleep afterwards with an easy conscience; but if you ever see me
'tripping on the light fantastic toe,' with an angelic creature who
is a communicant in a Bible-reading sect, you may write it down as an
immutable fact, that she asked me--not I her!"

Charley was lawless. Nobody criticised or was offended with him; and
Ida was always certain of finding in him, an ally and advocate; but
grateful as she was for his ready aid, upon occasions like the present,
she prized more highly the counsels, which his knowledge of mankind,
and his undeviating sense of rectitude qualified him to give. She had
faults,--he pointed them out; she erred in judgment,--he corrected the
evil as far as he could. The spectacle of his daily life was useful.
He possessed almost boundless influence over his associates, and their
attachment to him was close and strong. They understood, intuitively,
the worth of the inner man,--never fully unveiled to the majority of
them, and could not but admire and esteem. And Ida's constant thought
of him was--"If he, calling himself unconverted, accomplishes so
much--what ought not I--a Christian, to attempt?"




CHAPTER XXIV.


Mr. Read was in his private sitting-room;--it adjoined his chamber,
and his longest walk was from one apartment to the other. The sun
beamed cheerfully through the damask curtains, and the fire blazed
and crackled in the grate; but wrapped in his wadded dressing-gown,
his feet sunk heavily into a cushion, and his face contracted into
a fretful frown, he appeared to be enduring the extreme of cold and
discomfort. He was a sorry picture of a three months' bridegroom.
His surroundings were tasteful and luxurious,--books and papers and
pictures and handsome furniture, and at his elbow stood a silver
hand-bell, whose tongue would bring an obsequious servant, ready to
perform his bidding; yet his sigh, as he fidgeted uneasily in his downy
fauteuil, was a groan of repining.--"Like a jaded old hack! they
won't knock him in the head, in consideration of past services; but he
may die as soon as he can--the quicker the better!"

"The Northern papers have come, sir, and I thought you would like to
see them;" said a gentle voice. It was his ward. A grunt and a gesture
bade her put them upon the stand.

"Are you in pain this afternoon?" she asked, sympathizingly.

"I am always in pain!"

"Can I do anything for you?"

"No!" He reached for the papers; but a twinge in his shoulder forced
him to drop them. Ida picked them up. The desolate old man excited her
sincerest pity.

"It must weary you, holding those large sheets; and the print is fine.
If you will designate the articles you wish read, I will do it for you
with pleasure."

The offer was tempting, although its acceptance was ungracious. He
pointed to a piece, and she removed her bonnet and seated herself near
him. He did not inquire if she were going out, and she did not make her
sacrifice meritorious in his eyes, by informing him that she gave up
her walk to minister to his enjoyment. She read well;--her voice was
exquisitely modulated; her enunciation perfect; Mr. Read forgot to be
peevish, and his corrugated forehead lost half its wrinkles. When she
ceased, he seemed to have been lulled by a strain of music. The article
selected was an editorial leader on political economy, unintelligible
and prosy to Ida; but she endeavored not to let this appear. He nodded,
and stripped the envelope from another sheet. His eye gleamed, and with
an approach to a smile, he showed her six columns of an oration;--a
grand effort of the immortal sage of Marshfield. Ida was appalled at
the superficies of the solid mass, but she said over to herself, a
verse she had lisped at her mother's knee.

  "Did I this day, for small or great,
    My own pursuits forego,
  To lighten, by a feather's weight,
    The load of human woe?"

and began the terrible undertaking. The preamble over, she became
insensibly interested. Her soul-lit face and ringing intonations
supplied to the auditor, the actual presence of the orator; he looked
and listened until the light failed; then rang for candles. Mrs. Read,
returning from her airing, seated herself silently by the fire. It
was the prettiest domestic scene that had ever been witnessed in that
house; and how little reality was there in its air of home-happiness!

"Is that all?" asked Mr. Read, at supper-time.

"Almost, sir. I can soon finish it. I will not detain you Mrs. Read."
But she waited to hear the conclusion. A gruff "Thank you," was Ida's
only reward, besides the praise of her conscience; and her tired
throat obliged her to refuse Charley his favorite song that night,
but she did not repent. She volunteered her services whenever she
knew that there were new books or journals, and at length, the latest
intelligence was distasteful, unless it came through her lips. It was
a selfish gratification; and she did not delude herself with illusions
of personal attachment. She strove to live for the benefit and pleasure
of her fellow-beings; to leave her interest and ease out of sight; and
she could not have been in a better school. The woman's heart was not
still. There were moments of weariness and longing, and passionate
regrets. The soul, refusing the realities, which made up the sum of
every-day duty, pined for the remembered "Dream Land;"--its retreat,
and the scene of its holiday revels;--and when the aching and thirst
were at their height, it was a trial to smile at a caress from Mrs.
Dana, or a friendly act of Charley's--dear and thoughtful brother! when
she could have rested her tired head upon the kind bosom, and wept her
life away--but she did smile, and bore up bravely until God gave her
strength to rise above the weakness.

The Sabbath was a season of delight. A band of little girls watched
eagerly for her at Sabbath-school. Inclement indeed must the day
be, that saw their form vacant; for she was always at her post, and
regarded snow and rain as minor hindrances when her flock nestled
closely to "dear Miss Ida." No class loved their teacher and their
Bible so well as hers; her co-laborers said she had a secret spell,
by which she won and governed them; and she had,--for she was ever
mindful that she had another account to render than her report to the
Superintendent, and prayed that it might be--"Those whom Thou gavest
me, I have kept, and none of them is lost." She loved her pastor; but
her acquaintance with him was slight. He visited her at stated times,
and esteemed her an "amiable girl, with a creditable fund of general
information;" he "could not know the exercises of all his members;"
and that a woman whose life was so uncheckered, should have any
difficulties and sorrows, but such as are incidental to the experience
of every Christian, never crossed his brain. But he was a faithful
expounder of the Scriptures; and if he did not remark the changeful
light of the eyes, which never released him from the text to the "Amen"
of his discourse;--she felt that consolations and advice so applicable,
must be meant for her; and remembered him in her orisons, as a Shepherd
who cared for his sheep, and selected for each, food convenient for
him. She resolved repeatedly, to thank him for his fidelity; but her
courage melted when the opportunity arrived; and she would rebuke the
vanity that bred the desire. She read that in the primitive church,
"those who loved the Lord, spake often to one another;" and imagined,
in her simplicity, that such intercourse would be of mutual comfort
and profit; yet a seal was upon her mouth, and she waited and wished
in vain, for a word in the conversation of her brethren, which would
dissolve it. It was strange that she could speak freely and heartily
to Carry and to Charley, and be restrained by the presence of those,
who had tasted like joys--were bound upon the same pilgrimage as
herself.

There was an exception--a minister from another State, with whom she
once dined at Mr. Dana's; a merry-hearted, whole-souled man, whose
store of anecdote and pleasantry enlivened the company at table;--and
after dinner, gathering from a passing remark, that she was a
professing Christian, he sought her out; and while the rest were busy
