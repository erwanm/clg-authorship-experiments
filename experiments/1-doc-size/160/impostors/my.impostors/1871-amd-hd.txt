had her breakfast." 

" And the bread and biscuit ? " said Hannah. " We 
had just about enough to last over till to-morrow." 



 

" The biscuits may as well be cold, as they are 
really better for the children." 

" Why, I can make them too. It will seem quite 
like old times. I haven't done any kitchen work in 
ever so long." 

Kathie cleared the "pastry-table," and began to 
bring out some materials. 

"You had better put your room in order," said 
her mother, " and then you will have the whole 
morning." 

So Kathie ran up stairs. The bed had been airing 
in the morning sunshine, so she spread it up and 
dusted, and brought in a few fresh flowers. At that 
juncture Ada called. 

" I have had such a lovely sleep ! " she exclaimed. 

JL suppose you have been up an hour or two, and 
you look as bright as a rose. Dear, if I ever could 
look well again ! I am getting real sallow, - - am I
not ? and I did have such a sweet complexion. 
But it doesn't matter, after all. I shall never care 
much for anything again. O Kathie, if you only 
would do up my back hair I You can always manage 
it so nicely. Are you going to wear curls forever ? " 

Kathie' s curls were tied in a knot behind with 



 

a blue ribbon, and looked both cool and comforta- 
ble. 

"I don't know. Why are they not as good as 
' boughten ones, as Fred calls them ? " 

" But if you would braid part of it " 

" I will wait until I have to," Kathie returned, 
laughingly, taking up the comb. 

Kathie packed and padded after the requirements 
of fashion. She did not wonder that Ada's head often 
ached, with the cushion and the rolls and the great 
braid that was stuffed inside with just hair enough to 
cover the top. 

" It is a beautiful morning, isn't it ? Could 
not we go out driving, Kathie, before it gets so very 
warm ? >: 

" You may. I shall be busy. Uncle Eobert will 
take you with pleasure." 

" What are you going to do ? " 

" Jane has been sent for ; her mother is sick." 

" Something is always happening to servants, or to 
their fathers and mothers. However, I will excuse 
yon then " ; for she felt that she would full as lief go 
with Uncle Robert. 

Kathie washed her hands and ran down stairs, 



 

made a little toast and a cup of fresh coffee. Then 
she sat and chatted with Ada, who did seem in a 
very gracious mood. But as she heard Uncle Rob- 
ert's step, she ran out into the hall and preferred her 
request. 

" That just suits me," he said, good-humoredly. " I 
want to go over to the village." 

Ada put on her hat and stepped into the basket 
phaeton as if it was all her very own, and threw a 
rose-colored shawl over her light dress for effect, 
while she played with her inevitable sandal-wood 
fan, brought from Paris by mamma. 

Kathie carried the few dishes out to the kitchen, 
stood a great vase of flowers on the table, and dark- 
ened the blinds a trifle, to give the room a cool, 
shady look. Then she ran up stairs. Ada always 
did litter a room so. Here was her night-dress, there 
her sack, her slippers nearly in the middle of the 
floor, all her toilet articles about, and yesterday's 
dress thrown over a chair. She often laughed at 
Kathie for hei old-maidish ways, but the child could 
not help thinking how much time and trouble orderly 
habits saved. 

It was just nine when she went back to the kitchen. 



 

Hannah was washing dishes between, now, to fill up 
the vacancy. 

" I will have time to make your biscuit," she said. 

" Hannah, if you would only make some of your 
delightful macaroons instead ! ' 

" Would you like them, really ? Yes, I will do 
that and anything I can. And we will have the 
cream all right this afternoon. Children always do 
have such a good time when they come to this house." 

Kathie thought so too as she went at the biscuits. 
Two large pans full, looking absolutely flaky in the 
dough. Hannah held her hand in the oven a minute. 
" I guess it won't be too hot. They are beauties, 
Miss Kathie." 

Then she went to beating eggs. Hannah declared 
that it was too hard, and took the bowl and the beater 
herself. 

" You ought to be a little careful, Miss Kathie, and 
not spread your hands now while you are growing. 
Little girls' hands are tender." 

Kathie laughed. " Mamma's hands are pretty, and 
she has done a great deal of work." 

" It was after she had her growth. People's bones 
settle then, and are not so easily strained." 

 



 

Kathie did not take exception in physical or logi- 
cal view of the case, for beating eggs on a warm day 
was hard work.
