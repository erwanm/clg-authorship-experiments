" To-morrow many people will come, " 



 

he said. " I have ten married sisters and 
brothers. They all come from their 
ranchos, and many more. It will be very 
gay, my friends." 

" Good," said Rolclan, dismissing regret. 
" We will enjoy." 

" And after Christmas is gone I know 
of something else," said Rafael, myste 
riously. He glanced about. They stood 
in the midst of a great vineyard, each en 
gaged upon a large purple bunch. " Come," 
said Rafael, with an air of mystery. " Not 
here. Some one may hide beneath the 



vines." 



It was extremely unlikely, but the ad 
venturers liked the suggestion and followed 
their host breathlessly into the open field. 
" One day in the summer," whispered 
Rafael, his eyes rolling about, " I went with 
four vaqueros with a present of venison to 
Father Osuna. He was not at the Mis 
sion, and a brother told us that he walked 
among the hills. I thought I would go to 
meet him and receive his blessing. For a 
time I saw no one, and I thought, Ca- 
ramba! but the padre has long legs this 



 

hot weather! Just then he stood before 
me. He had walked out of the side of the 
hill through a hole no wider than himself. 
He sweated like a bull after collar, and his 
cassock was gathered in his two hands, 
leaving his bare shanks no more sacred 
than an Indian's. He did not look like a 
priest at all, and I forgot to kneel to him, 
but stared with my mouth open. And 
what do you think he did, my friends ? 
He turned white like the hand of a doiia 
in her teens and and dropped his cas 
sock. And " 

"Well? well?" 

"What do you think rolled to the 
ground, my friends? Chunks of yellow 
stuff that glittered, and a shower of spark 
ling yellow sand beautiful as sunshine 
on the floor. I gave a cry and ran to pick 
it up. I had never seen anything so beau 
tiful, I never had wanted anything so 
much. I felt that I would die for it in 
that moment, my friends. But that priest, 
what do you think he did? He gave a 
yell of rage, as if he could tear me in 
pieces, and flung himself all over that 
sunshine of earth. My gold ! he cried. 
 Mine ! mine ! You shall not take it from 
me! If it is yours it is not mine, my 
father," I said, feeling ashamed, though 
I still wanted it; I will help you to pick 
it up. He got up then, his face very red 
again, and I could see that he was trying 
to put on his dignity as fast as he had put 
down his cassock he looked better with 
both in place. My son, he said, * the day 
is warm and I am very tired, and, I fear, a 
little ill. These rocks are nothing. They 
please my eye, and I pick them up some 
times as I walk among the hills. Leave 
them there. I do not want them. We 
will return to the Mission. If you do 
not want them, then may I have them ? I 
asked the blood flew all over my body, 
my friends. He scowled as if I had asked 
him for the candles on the altar. No, 
he said, you cannot. Then he put his 
big hand on my shoulder he could twist 
your neck in a minute with those hands 
Listen to me, my son, he said, very soft, 
and looking so kind now, you can't think. 
"There is poison in those stones, pretty as 



 

they are, deadly poison. It has murdered 
millions of souls and hundreds of bodies. 
Therefore I will not let you touch it 
only a priest can touch it without ruining 
his soul. Therefore I forbid you I for 
bid you he shouted this over me, to 
tell any one of what you have seen to-day. 
Neither your father nor your mother no 
one. Do you understand ? I said Yes, 
but I did not promise, and he was excited 
and did not notice. Then he dragged me 
away, and I looked about for other rocks 
that glittered. But there were none not 
anywhere. And then I knew that they 
had come out of the hill ; but I said noth 
ing, and when we got back to the Mission 
and had had dinner and he was himself 
again and would have spoken alone with 
me, I ran and got on my horse, and all the 
brothers stood on the corridor to see me 
go. He came up to me and blessed me, 
and whispered : 'Tell no one, my son. If 
you do and he gave me a look that made 
my hair crackle at the roots. And to this 
clay I have told no one. Did I tell my 
parents the priest would know in six 



 

hours. No boy has stayed here that I 
like. But now " 

" We will go to the hill and see for our 
selves," said Roldan, promptly, and Aclan 
gasped with horror and delight. 

" Ay, I knew you would. I am brave, 
but I dared not go myself that padre is 
too big. I wake up in the night and see 
his hands pawing in the air. But three of 
us we need fear no one." 

" We will go as soon as the guests are 
gone. I have heard of this gold. In 
Europe I have an uncle who has trav 
elled and has told me many things 
bueno, in Europe, they make it into 
money and give it for things in big houses 
they call shops. Even here, in Monterey, 
and perhaps the other towns, they have a 
little it comes from Mexico. My uncle 
said that one reason we were so happy was 
because we had so little money none at 
all, we might say. That we got what we
