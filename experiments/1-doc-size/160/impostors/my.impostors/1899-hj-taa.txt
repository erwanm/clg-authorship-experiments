eyes of the elder, which, during a moment's silence, 
moved from the retreating visitor, now formally taken 
over at the door by Edward Brookenham, to Lady Fanny 
and her hostess, who, in spite of the embraces just per- 
formed, had again subsided together while Mrs. Brook 
gazed up in exalted intelligence. ' It's a funny house," 
said the Duchess at last.  '' She makes me such a scene 
over my not bringing Aggie, and still more over my very 
faint hint of my reasons for it, that I fly off, in com- 
punction, to do what I can, on the spot, to repair my ex- 
cess of prudence. I reappear, panting, with my niece — 
and it's to this company I introduce her !" 

Her companion looked at the charming child, to whom 
Lord Petherton was talking with evident kindness and 
gaiety — a conjunction that evidently excited Mitchy's in- 
terest. " May toe then know her ?" he asked with an ef- 
fect of drollery. '  May I — if he may ?" 

The Duchess's eyes, turned to him, had taken another 
light. He even gaped a little at their expression, which 
was, in a manner, carried out by her tone.  '' Go and 
talk to her, you perverse creature, and send him over to 
me." Lord Petherton, a minute later, had joined her ; 
Brookenham had left the room with Mrs. Donner ; his 
wife and Lady Fanny were still more closely engaged ; 
and the young Agnesina, though visibly a little scared at 
Mitcliy's queer countenance, had begun, after the fashion 
he had touched on to Mrs. Brook, politely to invoke the 
aid of the idea of habit. " Look here — you must help 
me," the Duchess said to Petherton. " You can, perfect- 
ly — and it's the first thing I've yet asked of you." 





 

" Oh, oh, oh !" her interlocutor laughed. 

"I must have Mitchy/' she went on without noticing 
his particular shade of humor. 

'' Mitchy too ?" — he appeared to wish to leave her in 
no doubt of it. 

   How low you are !" she simply said. " There are 
times when I despair of you. He's in every way your 
superior, and I like him so that — well, he must like her. 
Make him feel that he does." 

Lord Petherton turned it over as something put to him 
practically. "I could wish for him that he would. I see 
in her possibilities !" he continued to laugh. 

 ' I dare say you do. / see them in Mitchett, and I 
trust you'll understand me when I say that I appeal to 
you.'' 

' Appeal to Mm straight. That's much better," Peth- 
erton lucidly observed. 

The Duchess wore for a moment her proudest air, 
\ hich made her, in the connection, exceptionally gentle. 
 'He doesn't like me." 

Her interlocutor looked at her with all his bright bru- 
tality. '  Oh, my dear, I can speak for you — if thafs what 
you want !" 

The Duchess met his eyes, and so, for an instant, they 
sounded each other. "You're so abysmally coarse that I 
often wonder — " But, as the door reopened, she caught 
herself. It was the effect of a face apparently directed 
at her. " Be quiet. Here's Edward."

BOOK THIRD 
MR. LONGDON 



If Mitchy arrived exactly at the hour, it was quite by 
design and on a calculation — over and above the little 
pleasure it might give him — of ten minutes clear with 
his host, whom it rarely befell him to see alone. He 
had a theory of something special to go into, of a plum- 
met to sink or a feeler to put forth; his state of mind, 
in short, was diplomatic and anxious. But his hopes 
had a drop as he crossed the threshold. His precaution 
had only assured him the company of a stranger, for the 
person in the room, to whom the servant announced him, 
was not old Van. On the other hand this gentleman 
would clearly be old — what was it ? the fellow Vander- 
bank had made it a matter of such importance he should 
"really know.'' But were they then simply to have tea 
there together ? No ; the candidate for Mr. Mitchett's 
acquaintance, as if quickly guessing his apprehension, 
mentioned on the spot that their entertainer would be 
with them : he had just come home in a hurry, fearing he 
was late, and then had rushed off to make a change. 
"Fortunately," said the speaker, who offered his ex- 
planation as if he had had it on his mind — " fortunately 
the ladies haven't yet come." 

" Oh, there are to be ladies ?" Mr. Mitchett genially 
replied. 





  

His fellow-guest, who was sliy and apparently nervous, 
sidled about a little, swinging an eye-glass, yet glancing 
in a manner a trifle birdlike from object to object. 
"Mrs. Edward Brookenham, I think." 

"Oh I" Mitchy himself felt, as soon as this comment 
had quitted his lips, that it might sound even to a 
stranger like a sign, such as the votaries of Mrs. Edward 
Brookenham had fallen into the way of constantly throw- 
ing off, that he recognized her hand in the matter. There 
was, however, something in his entertainer's face that 
somehow encouraged frankness ; it had the sociability of 
surprise — it hadn't the chill. Mitchy saw, at the same 
time, that this friend of old Van's would never really 
understand him ; though that was a thing he at times 
liked people as much for as he liked them little for it at 
others. It was in fact when he most liked that he was 
on the whole most tempted to mystify. " Only Mrs. 
Brook ? — no others ?" 

"'Mrs. Brook'?'' his friend echoed; staring an in- 
stant, as if literally missing the connection ; but quickly 
after, to show he was not stupid — and indeed it seemed 
to show he was delightful— smiling with extravagant in- 
telligence. " Is that the right thing to say ?" 

Mitchy gave the kindest of laughs. " Well, I dare 
say I oughtn't to." 

" Oh, I didn't mean to correct you," his interlocutor 
hastened to profess; "I meant, on the contrary, will it 
be right for me too ?" 

Mitchy's great goggle attentively fixed him. " Try it." 

''To her?"
