 

occupied the benches near him, till Bartley was left 
sitting alone with his counsel. We are beginning to 
talk here at the East of the decline of oratory ; but it 
is still a passion in the West, and his listeners now 
clustered about the Squire in keen appreciation of his 
power ; it seemed to summon even the loiterers in the 
street, whose ascending tramp on the stairs continu 
ally made itself heard ; the lawyers, the officers of 
the court, the judge, forgot their dinner, and posed 
themselves anew in their chairs to listen. 

No doubt the electrical sphere of sympathy and 
admiration penetrated to the old man 's consciousness. 
When he pulled off his black satin stock the relic 
of ancient fashion which the piety of his daughter 
kept in repair and laid it on the table, there was a 
deep inarticulate murmur of satisfaction which he 
could not have mistaken. His voice rose again : 

" If the plaintiff indeed came at that time, the 
walls of those empty rooms, into which he peered like 
a thief in the night, might have told him if walls 
had tongues to speak as they have ears to hear a 
tale that would have melted even his heart with 
remorse and shame. They might have told him of a 
woman waiting in hunger and cold for his return, and 
willing to starve and freeze, rather than own herself 
forsaken, waiting till she was hunted from her 
door by the creditors whom he had defrauded, and 
forced to confess her disgrace and her despair, in order 
to save herself from the unknown terrors of the law, 
invoked upon her innocent head by his villany. 
This is the history of the first two weeks of those two 
years, during which, as his perjured lips have sworn, 
he was using every effort to secure her return to him. 
I will not enlarge now upon this history, nor upon 
that of the days and weeks and months that followed, 
wringing the heart and all but crazing the brain of 
the wife who would not, in the darkest hours of her 



 

desolation, believe herself wilfully abandoned. But 
we have the record, unbroken and irrefragable, which 
shall not only right his victim, but shall bring yonder 
perjurer to justice." 

The words had an iron weight ; they fell like blows. 
Bartley did not stir ; but Marcia moved uneasily in 
her chair, and a low pitiful murmur broke from behind 
her veil. Her father stopped again, panting, and his 
dry lips closed and parted several times before lie 
could find his voice again. But at that sound of 
grief he partially recovered himself, and went on 
brokenly. 

" I now ask this Court, for due cause, to set aside 
the default upon which judgment has been rendered 
against the defendant, and I shall then ask leave to 
file her cross-petition for divorce." 

Marcia started half-way from her chair, and then 
fell back again ; she looked round at Halleck as if for 
help, and hid her face in her hands. Her father cast 
a glance at her as if for her approval of this develop 
ment of his plan. 

" Then, may it please the Court, upon the rendition 
of judgment in our favor upon that petition a result 
of which I have no more doubt than of my own exist 
ence I shall demand under your law the indictment 
of yonder perjurer for his crime, and I shall await in 
security the sentence which shall consign him to a 
felon 's cell in a felon 's garb " 

Marcia flung herself upon her father 's arm, out 
stretched toward Bartley. " No ! No ! No ! " she 
cried, with deep, shuddering breaths, in a voice thick 
with horror. " Never ! Let him go ! I will not have 
it ! I didn 't understand ! I never meant to harm 
him ! Let him go ! Tt is my cause, and I say " 

The old man 's arm dropped ; he fixed a ghastly, be 
wildered look upon his daughter, and fell forward 
across the table at which he stood. The judge started 



 

from his chair ; the people leaped over the benches, 
and crushed about the Squire, who fetched his breath 
in convulsive gasps. " Keep back ! " " Give him 
air ! " " Open the window ! " " Get a doctor ! " cried 
those next him. 

Even Hartley 's counsel had joined the crowd about 
the Squire, from the midst of which broke the long, 
frightened wail of a child. This was Hartley 's oppor 
tunity. When his counsel turned to look for him, 
and advise his withdrawal from a place where he 
could do no good, and where possibly he might come 
to harm, he found that his advice had been anticipated : 
Hartley 's chair was vacant. 



 



XLI. 

THAT night when Halleck had left the old man to 
the care of Marcia and Olive, for the time, a note was 
brought to him from Bartley 's lawyer, begging the 
favor of a few moments interview on very important 
business. It might be some offer of reparation or 
advance in Marcia 's interest, and Halleck went with 
the bearer of the note. The lawyer met him hos 
pitably at the door of his office. " How do you do, 
sir ? " he said, shaking hands. Then he indicated a 
bulk withdrawn into a corner of the dimly-lighted 
room ; the blinds were drawn, and he locked the door 
after Halleck 's entrance. "Mr. Hubbard, whom I 
think you know," he added. " I 'll  just step into the 
next room, gentlemen, and will be subject to your 
call at any moment." 

The bulk lifted itself and moved some paces toward 
Halleck ; Bartley even raised his hand, with the vague 
expectation of taking Halleck s, but seeing no respon 
sive gesture on his part, he waved a salutation and 
dropped it again to his side. 

" How d ye do, Halleck ? Rather a secret, black, 
and midnight interview," he said jocosely. " But I 
couldn 't very well manage it otherwise. I 'm not 
just in the position to offer you the freedom of the 
city." 

" What do you want, Hubbard ? " asked Halleck, 
bluntly. 

"How is the old Squire? * 

" The doctor thinks he may rally from the shock." 



 

" Paralysis ? "
