might serve as one of the stretcher-bearers.

Half way down the block we came to the Palace Hotel, and uniformed
men came pouring out of that. I heard the shrieks of a woman, and
put my foot on the edge of a store-window, and raised myself up by
an awning, to see over the heads of the crowd. Half a dozen rowdies
had got hold of a girl; I don’t know what she had done--maybe her
skirts were too short, or maybe she had been saucy to one of the
gang; anyhow, they were tearing her clothes to shreds, and having
done this gaily, they took her on their shoulders, and ran her out
to the wagon, and tossed her up beside the Red Prophet. “There’s a
girl for you!” they yelled; and the drunken fellow who wanted
Carpenter to cure him, suddenly thought of a new witticism: “Hey,
you goddam Bolsheviki, why don’t you nationalize her?” Men laughed
and whooped over that; some of them were so tickled that they danced
about and waved their arms in the air. For, you see, they knew all
the details concerning the “nationalization of women in Russia,” and
also they had read in the papers about Mary Magna, and Carpenter’s
fondness for picture-actresses and other gay ladies. He stretched
out his hand to the girl, to save her from falling off; and at this
there went up such a roar from the mob, that it made me think of
wild beasts in the arena. So to my whirling brain came back the
words that Carpenter had spoken: “It is Rome! It is Rome! Rome that
never dies!”

The cortege came to the “Hippodrome,” which is our biggest theatre,
and which, like everything else, had declared open house for Brigade
members during the convention. Some one in the crowd evidently knew
the building, and guided the procession down a side street, to the
stage-entrance. They have all kinds of shows in the “Hippodrome,”
 and have a driveway by which they bring in automobiles, or
war-chariots, or wild animals in cages, or whatever they will. Now
the mob stormed the entrance, and brushed the door-keepers to one
side, and unbolted and swung back the big gates, and a swarm of
yelling maniacs rushed the lumbering prairie-schooner up the slope
into the building.

The unlucky girl rolled off at this point, and somebody caught her,
and mercifully carried her to one side. The wagon rolled on; the
advance guard swept everything out of the way, scenery as well as
stage-hands and actors, and to the vast astonishment of an audience
of a couple of thousand people, the long string of rope-pullers
marched across the stage, and after them came the canvas-covered
vehicle with the red-painted letters, and the red-painted victim
clinging to the top. The khaki-clad swarm gathered about him,
raising their deafening chant: “Hi! Hi! The Bolsheviki prophet. Hi!
Hi! The Bolsheviki prophet!”

I had got near enough so that I could see what happened. I don’t
know whether Carpenter fainted; anyhow, he slipped from his perch,
and a score of upraised hands caught him. Some one tore down a
hanging from the walls of the stage set, and twenty or thirty men
formed a cirfcle about it, and put the prophet in the middle of it,
and began to toss him ten feet up into the air and catch him and
throw him again.

And that was all I could stand--I turned and went out by the rear
entrance of the theatre. The street in back was deserted; I stood
there, with my hands clasped to my head, sick with disgust; I found
myself repeating out loud, over and over again, those words of
Carpenter: “It is Rome! It is Rome! Rome that never dies!”

A moment later I heard a crash of glass up above me; I ducked, just
in time to avoid a shower of it. Then I looked up, and to my
consternation saw the red-painted head and the red and white
shoulders of Carpenter suddenly emerging. The shoulders were quickly
followed by the rest of him; but fortunately there was a narrow shed
between him and the ground. He struck the shed, and rolled, and as
he fell, I caught him, and let him down without harm.

I expected to find my prophet nearly dead; I made ready to get him
onto my shoulders and find some place to hide him. But to my
surprise he started to his feet. I could not see much of him,
because of the streams of paint; but I could see enough to realize
that his face was contorted with fury. I remembered that gentle,
compassionate countenance; never had I dreamed to see it like this!

He raised his clenched hands. “I meant to die for this people! But
now--let them die for themselves!” And suddenly he reached out to me
in a gesture of frenzy. “Let me get away from them! Anywhere,
anyway! Let me go back where I was--where I do not see, where I do
not hear, where I do not think! Let me go back to the church!”

With these words he started to run down the street; hauling up his
long robes--never would I have dreamed that a prophet’s bare legs
could flash so quickly, that he could cover the ground at such
amazing speed! I set out after him; I had stuck to him thus far, and
meant to be in at the finish, whatever it was. We came out on
Broadway again, and there were more crowds of soldier boys; the
prophet sped past them, like a dog with a tin-can tied to its tail.
He came to a cross-street, and dodged the crowded traffic, and I
also got through, knocking pedestrians this way and that. People
shouted, automobiles tooted; the soldiers whooped on the trail. I
began to get short of breath, a little dizzy; the buildings seemed
to rock before me, there were mobs everywhere, and hands clutching
at me, nearly upsetting me. But still I followed my prophet with the
bare flying legs; we swept around another corner, and I saw the goal
to which the tormented soul was racing--St. Bartholomew’s!

He went up the steps three at a time, and I went up four at a time
behind him. He flung open the door and vanished inside; when I got
in, he was half way up the aisle. I saw people in the church start
up with cries of amazement; some grabbed me, but I broke away--and
saw my prophet give three tremendous leaps. The first took him up
the altar-steps; the second took him onto the altar; the third took
him up into the stained-glass window.

And there he turned and faced me. His paint-smeared robes fell down
about his bare legs, his convulsed and angry face became as gentle
and compassionate as the paint would permit. With a wave of his
hand, he signalled me to stand back and let him alone. Then the hand
sank to his side, and he stood motionless. Exhausted, dizzy, I fell
against one of the pews, and then into a seat, and bowed my head in
my arms.

I don’t know just how much time passed after that. I felt a hand on
my shoulder, and realized that some one was shaking me. I had a
horror of hands reaching out for me, so I tried to get away from
this one; but it persisted, and there was a voice, saying, “You must
get up, my friend. It’s time we closed. Are you ill?”

I raised my head; and first I glanced at the figure above the altar.
It was perfectly motionless; and--incredible as it may seem--there
was no trace of red paint upon either the face or the robes! The
figure was dignified and serene, with a halo of light about its
head--in short, it was the regulation stained glass figure that I
had gazed at through all my childhood.

“What is the matter?” asked the voice at my side; and I looked up,
and discovered the Reverend Mr. Simpkinson. He recognized me, and
cried: “Why, Billy! For heaven sake, what has happened?”

I was dazed, and put my hand to my jaw. I realized that my head was
aching, and that the place I touched was sore. “I--I---” I
stammered. “Wait a minute.” And then, “I think I was hurt.” I tried
to get my thoughts together. Had I been dreaming; and if so, how
much was dream and how much was reality? “Tell me,” I said, “is
there a moving picture theatre near this church?”

“Why, yes,” said he. “The Excelsior.”

“And--was there some sort of riot?”

“Yes. Some ex-soldiers have been trying to keep people from going in
there. They are still at it. You can hear them.”

I listened. Yes, there was a murmur of voices outside. So I realized
what had happened to me. I said: “I was in that mob, and I got
beaten up. I was knocked pretty nearly silly, and fled in here.”
