the place ? It is a fine situation just in the Corso and only 
one flight of stairs, a beautiful position for the Carnival Of 
course, if you are inclined to pay more than Signor Gouache, 
I do not say but what ' 

' I do not want your lodgings, my good woman,' returned 
Giovanni in gentler tones. ' I want to know who comes to 
gee your lodger.' 

'Who should come? His friends of course. Who 
elsef 

'A lady, perhaps,' said Giovanni in a thick voice. It 
hurt him to say it, and the words almost stuck in his throat. 
' Perhaps a lady comes sometimes,' he repeated, pulling out 
some loose bank notes. 

The old woman's filmy eyes suddenly twinkled in the 
gloom. The sound of the crisp pieces of paper was delight 
ful to her ear. 

' Well,' she said after a moment's hesitation, ' if a beautiful 
lady does come here, that is the Signore's affair. It is none 
of my business.' 

Giovanni thrust the notes into her palm, which was 
already wide open to receive them. His heart beat wildly. 

' She is beautiful, you say V 

' Oh ! As beautiful as you please ! ' chuckled the hag. 

' Is she dark V 

' Of course,' replied the woman. There was no mistaking 
the tone in which the question was asked, for Giovanni was 
no longer able to conceal anything that he felt. 

' And tall, I suppose ? Yes. And she was here a 
quarter of an hour ago, you say ? Speak out ! ' he cried, 
advancing a step towards the old creature. 'If you lie to 
me, I will kill you ! She was here do not deny it.' 

'Yes yes,' answered the woman, cowering back in some 








terror. ' Per cariiA ! Don't murder me I tell you the 
truth.' 

With a sudden movement Giovanni turned on his heel 
and entered Gouache's sitting-room. It was now almost 
dark in the house and he struck a match and lighted a 
candle that stood on the table. The glare illuminated his 
swarthy features and fiery eyes, and the veins stood out on 
his forehead and temples like strained and twisted cords. 
He looked about him in every direction, examining the table, 
strewn with papers and books, the floor, the furniture, ex 
pecting every moment to find something which should prove 
that Corona had been there. Seeing nothing, he entered 
the bedroom beyond. It was a small chamber and he had 
scarcely passed through the door when he found himself 
before the toilet table. The note San Giacinto had left was 
there pinned upon the little cushion with the gold pin, as he 
had placed it. 

Giovanni stared wildly at the thing for several seconds 
and his face grew deadly white. There was no evidence 
lacking now, for the pin was Corona's own. It was a 
simple enough object, made of plain gold, the head being 
twisted into the shape of the letter C, but there was no 
mistaking its identity, for Giovanni had designed it himself. 
Corona used it for fastening her veil. 

As the blood sank from his head to his heart Giovanni 
grew very calm. He set the candle upon the toilet -table 
and took the note, after putting the pin in his pocket. The 
handwriting seemed to be feigned, and his lip curled scorn 
fully as he looked at it and then, turning it over, saw that 
the envelope was one of Corona's own. It seemed to him a 
pitiable piece of folly in her to distort her writing when 
there was such abundant proof on all sides to convict her. 
Without the slightest hesitation he opened the letter and read 
it, bending down and holding it near the candle. One perusal 
was enough. He smiled curiously as he read the words, ' I 
am so watched that I can do nothing. Some one suspects 
something.' His attention was arrested by the statement 
that a trusty person the words were underlined would 
Ving the note. The meaning of the emphasis was explained 




by the pin ; the trusty person was herself, who, perhaps by 
an afterthought, had left the bit of gold as a parting gift in 
case Gouache marched before they met again. 

Giovanni glanced once more round the room, half expect 
ing to find some other convicting piece of evidence. Then 
he hesitated, holding the candle in one hand and the note in 
the other. He thought of staying where he was and waiting 
for Gouache, but the idea did not seem feasible. Nothing 
which implied waiting could have satisfied him at that 
moment, and after a few seconds he thrust the note into his 
pocket and went out. His hand was on the outer door, when 
he remembered the old woman who sat crouching over her 
pan of coals, scarcely able to believe her good luck, and 
longing for Giovanni's departure in order that she might 
count the crisp notes again. She dared not indulge herself 
in that pleasure while he was present, lest he should repent 
of his generosity and take back a part of them, for she had 
seen how he had taken them from his pocket and saw that 
he had no idea how much he had given. 

'You will say nothing of my coming,' said Giovanni, 
fixing his eyes upon her. 

' I, Signore ? Do not be afraid ! Money is better than 
words.' 

' Very good,' he answered. ' Perhaps you will get twice 
as much the next time I want to know the truth.' 

' God bless you ! ' chuckled the wrinkled creature. He 
went out, and the little bell that was fastened to the door 
tinkled as the latch sprang back into its place. Then the 
woman counted the price of blood, which had so unexpectedly 
fallen into her hands. The bank-notes were many and broad, 
and crisp and new, for Giovanni had not reckoned the cost. 
It was long since old Caterina Ranucci had seen so much 
money, and she had certainly never had so much of her own. 

' Qualche innamorato ! ' she muttered to herself as she 
smoothed the notes one by one and gloated over them and 
built castles in the air under the light of her little oil lamp. 
' It is some fellow in love. Heaven pardon me if I have 
done wrong! He seemed so anxious to know that the 
woman had been here why should I not content himl 



Poveretto ? He must be rich. I will always tell him what 
he wants to know. Heaven bring him often and bless 
him.' 

Then she rocked herself backwards and forwards, hugging 
her pot of coals and crooning the words of an ancient Roman 
ditty
