departed, and gave place to an easy and confident 
bearing. He worked the whipping-boy mine to 
ever-increasing profit. 

He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady 
Jane Grey into his presence when he wanted to play 
or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with 
them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed 
to such performances. It no longer confused him 
to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at 
parting. 

He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state 
at night, and dressed with intricate and solemn 
ceremony in the morning. It came to be a proud 
pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering 
procession of officers of state and gentlemen-at- 
arms; insomuch, indeed, that he doubled his guard 
of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. 
He liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long 
corridors, and the distant voices responding, “Way 
for the King!” 

He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state 
in council, and seeming to be something more than 
the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He liked to receive 
great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, 
and listen to the affectionate messages they brought 
from illustrious monarchs who called him “brother.” 
Oh, happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court! 

He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered 
more; he found his four hundred servants too few 
for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. The 
adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet 
music to his ears. He remained kind and gentle, 
and a sturdy and determined champion of all that 
were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon 
unjust laws; yet upon occasion, being offended, he 
could turn upon an earl, or even a duke, and give 
him a look that would make him tremble. Once, 
when his royal “sister,” the grimly holy Lady 
Mary, set herself to reason with him against the 
wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people 
who would otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, 
and reminded him that their august late father’s 
prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty 
thousand convicts at one time, and that during his 

admirable reign lie had delivered seventy-two 
thousand thieves and robbers over to death by the 
executioner, the boy was filled with generous 
indignation, and commanded her to go to her closet, and 
beseech God to take away the stone that was in her 
breast, and give her a human heart. 

Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the 
poor little rightful prince who had treated him so 
Idndly, and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge 
him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace gate? 
Yes; his flrst royal days and nights were pretty well 
sprinkled with painful thoughts about the lost prince, 
and with sincere longings for his return and happy 
restoration to his native rights and splendors. But 
as time wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s 
mind became more and more occupied with his new 
and enchanting experiences, and by little and little 
the vanished monarch faded almost out of his 
thoughts; and finally, when he did intrude upon 
them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome 
specter, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed. 

Tom’s poor mother and sisters traveled the same 
road out of his mind. At first he pined for them, 
sorrowed for them, longed to see them; but later, 
the thought of their coming some day in their rags 
and dirt, and betraying him with their kisses, and 
pulling him down from his lofty place, and dragging 
him back to penury and degradation and the slums, 
made him shudder. At last they ceased to trouble 
his thoughts almost wholly. And he was content, 
even glad; for, whenever their mournful and accusing
faces did rise before Hm now, they made 
him feel more despicable than the worms that crawl. 

At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty 
was sinking to sleep in his rich bed in the palace, 
guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded by the 
pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for to-morrow was 
the day appointed for his solemn crowning as king 
of England, At that same hour, Edward, the true 
king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn 
mth travel, and clothed in rags and shreds — his 
share of the results of the riot — was wedged in 
among a crowd of people who were watc hing with 
deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen 
who streamed in and out of Westminster Abbey, 
busy as ants; they were making the last preparation 
for the royal coronation. 



THE RECOGNITION PROCESSION 

WHEN Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the 
air was heavy with a thunderous murmiur; all 
the distances were charged with it. It was music to 
him; for it meant that the English world was out in 
its strength to give loyal welcome to the great day. 
Presently Tom found himself once more the chief 
figure in a wonderful floating pageant on the Thames ; 
for by ancient custom the “recognition procession” 
through London must start from the Tower, and he 
was bound thither. 

When he arrived there, the sides of the venerable 
fortress seemed suddenly rent in a thousand places, 
and from every rent leaped a red tongue of flame 
and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion 
followed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude,
and made the ground tremble; the flame-jets, 
the smoke, and the explosions were repeated over 
and over again with marvelous celerity, so that in a 
few moments the old Tower disappeared in the vast 
fog of its own smoke, all but the very top of the tall 
pile called the White Tower; this, with its banners, 
stood out above the dense bank of vapor as a 
mountain peak projects above a cloud-rack. 

Tom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing 
war-steed, whose rich trappings almost reached 
to the ground; his “uncle,” the Lord Protector 
Somerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; 
the Kang’s Guard formed in single ranks on either 
side, clad in burnished armor; after the Protector 
followed a seemingly interminable procession of 
resplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after 
these came the lord mayor and the aldermanic body, 
in crimson velvet robes, and with their gold chains 
across their breasts; and after these the officers and 
members of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, 
and bearing the showy banners of the several cor- 
porations. Also in the procession, as a special 
guard of honor through the city, was the Ancient 
and Honorable Artillery Company — an organization 
already three htmdred years old at that time, and 
the only military body in England possessing the 
privilege (which it still possesses in our day) of
holding itself independent of the commands of Parlia- 
ment. It was a brilliant spectacle, and was hailed 
with acclamations all along the line, as it took 
its stately way through the packed mtiltitudes of 
citizens. The chronicler says, “The king, as he 
entered the dty, was received by the people with 
prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and 
all signs which argue an earnest love of subjects 
toward their sovereign; and the king, by holding 
up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, 
and most tender language to those that stood nigh 
his Grace, showed himself no less thankful to
