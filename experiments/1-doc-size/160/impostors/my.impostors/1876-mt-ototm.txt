go. He could not forget anything. It was simply 
impossible. The most trivial details remained as 
distinct and luminous in his head, after they had 
lain there for years, as the most memorable 
events. His was not simply a pilot's memory ; its 
grasp was universal. If he were talking about a 
trifling letter he had received seven years before, 
he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed 
from memory. And then, witliout observing that 
he was departing from the true line of his talk, he 
was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn par- 
enthetical biography ol the writer of that letter ; 
and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up 
that writer's relatives, one by one, and give you 
their biographies, too. 

Such a memory as that is a gi'eat misfortune. To 
it, all occurrences are ol the same size. Its posses- 
sor cannot distinguish an interesting circumstance 
from an uninteresting one. As a talker, he is bound 
to clog his narrative with tiresome details and make 
himself an insufferable bore. Moreover, he cannot 
stick to his subject. He picks up every little grain 
of memory he discerns in his way, and so is led 

aside. Mr. J would start out with the honest 

intention of telling you a vastly funny anecdote 
about a dog. He would be " so full of laugh" that 
he could hardly begin ; then his memory would 
start with the dog's breed and personal appearance; 
drift into a history of his owner; of his owner's 
family, with descriptions of weddings and burials 
that had occurred in it, together with recitals of 
congratulatory verses and obituary poetry provoked 
by the same; then this memory would recollect 
that one of these events occurred during the cele- 
brated " hard winter " of such and such a year, and 
a minute description of that winter would follow, 
along with the names of people who were frozen to 
death, and statistics showing the high figures which 
pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay would 
suggest com and fodder; com and fodder would 
suggest cows and horses ; the latter would suggest 
the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders ; 
the transition from the circus to the menagerie was 
easy and natural ; from the elephant to equatorial 
Africa was but a step ; then of course the heathen 
savages would suggest religion ; and at the end of 
three or four hours' tedious jaw, the watch would 
change and J would go out of the pilot-house 
muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years 
before about the efficacy of prayer as a means of 
grace. And the original first mention would be all 
you had learned about that dog, after all this wait- 
ing and hungering. 

A pilot must have a memory ; but there are two 
higher qualities which he must also have. He must 
have good and quick judgment and decision, and a 
cool, calm courage that no peril can shake. Give a 
man the merest trifle of pluck to start with, and by 
the time ho has become a pilot he cannot be unman- 
ned by any danger a steamboat can get into; but one 
cannot quite say the same for judgment. Judg- 
ment is a matter of brains, and a man must start 
with a good stock of that article or he will never 
succeed as a pilot. 

The growth of courage in the pilot-house is 
steady all the time, but it does not reach a high 
and satisfactory condition until some time after the 
young pilot has been " standing his own watch," 
alone and under the staggering weight of all the 
responsibilities connected with the position. When 
an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquain- 
ted with the river, he goes clattering along so fear- 
lessly with his steamboat, night or day, that he 
presently begins to imagine that it is his courage 
that animates him ; but the fii-st time the pilot 
steps out and leaves him to his own devices he finds 
out it was the other man's. He discovers that the 
article has been left out of his own cargo altogether. 
The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a 
moment ; he is not prepared for them ; he does not 
know how to meet them ; all his knowledge for- 
sakes him ; and within fifteen minutes he is as 
white as a sheet and scared almost to death. There- 
fore pilots wisely train these cubs by various strat- 
egic tricks to look danger in the face a little more 
calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to play a 
friendly bwindle upon the candidate. 



Mr. B served me in this fashion once, and for 

years afterwards I used to blush even in my sleep 
when I thought of it. I had become a good steers 
man ; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to 

do on our watch, night or day ; Mr. B seldom 

made a suggestion to me ; all he ever did was to 
take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in par- 
ticularly bad crossings, land the boat when she 
needed to be landed, play gentleman of leisure nine 
tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The 
lower river was about bank-full, and if anybody 
had questioned my ability to run any crossing be- 
tween Cairo and New Orleans without help or in- 
struction, I should have felt irreparably hurt. The 
idea of being afraid of any crossing in the lot, in 
the day-time, was a thing too preposterous for con- 
templation. Well, one matchless summer's day I 
was bowling down the bend above island 66, 
brim full of self-conceit and carrying my nose as 
high as a giraffe's, when Mr. B said, â€” 

"I am going below a while. I suppose you 
know the next crossing ? " 

This was almost an aflfront. It was about the 
plainest and simplest crossing in the whole river. 
One couldn't come to any harm, whether he ran it 
right or not ; and as for depth, there never had 
been any bottom there. I knew all this, perfectly 
well. 

Know how to run it ? Why, I can run it with 
my eyes shut." 


" How much water is there in it ? " 

" Well, that is an odd question. I couldn't get 
bottom there with a church steeple." 
. "You think so, do you?" 

The very tone of the question shook my confi- 
dence. That was what Mr. B was expecting. 

He left, without saying anything more. I began 

to imagine all sorts of things. Mr. B , unknown 

to me, of course, sent somebody down to the fore- 
castle with some mysterious instruction to the 
leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper 

among the officers, and then Mr. B went into 

hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could ob- 
serve results. Presently the captain stepped out on 
the hurricane dock ; next the chief mate appeared ; 
then a clerk. Every moment or two a straggler 
was added to my audience ; and before I got to the 
head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people 
assembled down there under my nose. I began to 
wonder what the trouble was. As I started across
