interspersed that made a sort of jolliness in 
her face. 

"Don't you want to read it?'’ she asked, 
rather timidly. 

"Mrs. Borden just did. She and Florence 
had wondered whether Marilla had made any 
invidious comparisons about the change to 
actual service instead of being treated as a 
guest in a fine house. 

'If — you'd like me to," with the proper 
hesitation. 




"Oh, yes. And I used to tell him about the 
babies, that they were so good and hardly 
ever cried, and how I told them stories and 
they laughed just as if they understood — 
didn't they?'’ 

"You made them understand. You're an 
odd little girl, Marilla, and I don't know 
what we would do without you, but then you 
do really belong to us. I do suppose the 
baths would be a good thing if you were not 
afraid. Now, we can't coax Jack to go in the 
water, though he delights to run along the 
edge barefooted. That's fun for the children. 
But you see if we all went some one must 
look after the children. Then there's the time 
for their nap and there'd be no one to go with 
you. There seems so many things to do in the 
afternoon now that we have joined the 
Clubs. And there's teas and things " 

"Yes," Marilla returned, meekly. 

"Why wouldn't you go in the water?" she 
asked Jack a few days afterward. 

'"Cause there's sharks. Stevie said so. An' 
they eat up people." 

"Why don't they eat up — well, they haven't 
eaten up any one yet. We should have heard 
of it." 



'They only eat up children. The big folks 
kick ’em out of the way. But you’ve got to 
be real strong an’ have a big foot. You just 
give it to ’em by the side of the jaw and they 
flop down in the water. That big Jimmy Lane 
has seen them lots of times.” 

There was a great sand heap where the 
smaller children went to play and tumble 
about and build forts and ovens and some- 
times sand each other. Marilla took the babies 
out in the carriage after they had their dinner 
and were dressed afresh. Sometimes she met 
the girls sauntering about, sometimes with the 
nurse maids. The two ladies went to a 
Whist Club, and one afternoon played Bridge, 
and between times they met on each others’ 
porches. 

The afternoon of the children’s lawn party 
the street was fairly thronged. There were 
growing people within the enclosure by special 
invitation. And how pretty the young people 
were in their beautiful summer attire with 
laces and ribbons and bead chains and white 
ties with a great bow almost as big as the foot. 

There were four pieces of music. Oh, the 
dancing was just bewitching? Marilla drew 





long breaths and wished she was among them ; 
every pulse in her body kept time. The trees 
waved and nodded, some birds sang and there 
were sounds of happy laughter. 

"Get away from here with this big caboose 
of yourn!'' said a rough voice, "you take up 
too much room,’’ and he wheeled the carriage 
around so suddenly the babies almost toppled 
over. "Other people want a chance. Get 
along, I say!” 

She had no choice but to go on. 

'I’m glad he sent off that nurse girl,” ex- 
claimed a woman with two children clinging 
to her skirts. "Those great wagons are such 
a nuisance!” 

Marilla crossed the street and went slowly 
up and down. When the throng moved about 
a little she could see the white fairy figures 
floating over the greensward, and hear the 
music that set one’s nerves a-tingle. The 
outside crowd began to disperse, but the man 
loitered about, so she did not dare go back. 

Then they brought out some tables on the 
lawn and began to arrange them. Oh, how 
daintily pretty it was! She recognized some 



of the girls, and in spite of her courage, 
sighed as she turned away. 

Those were the sisters for whom the coach 
and four waited, with the footman and 
outriders, and who would be made welcome 
at all the grand functions of life, while the 
Cinderellas were relegated to the chimney 
comer. And’the godmother must come out of 
fairy land, if she came at all, and transformed 
one with a wand. That was why the glories 
were so unsubstantial, and why the dream 
must end at midnight. 

The babies were clamoring for supper. 
The house was all alone. She lifted them out 
and helped them up the steps, then gave them 
each a biscuit while she prepared their bread 
and milk. The ladies came home from their 
Whist. Mrs. Borden had won the first prize 
and they were talking as eagerly as boys over 
a baseball score. There was Jack, dirty and 
tousled as any tramp. 

' Wash him up Marilla and put him in some 
clean clothes or we’ll be late for dinner. 
Come, be quick, child.” 

That was the portion of the Cinderellas. 


CHAPTER IX 


THE LITTLE THORNS 

They were all very glad to be home again. 
The house was so clean and orderly and there 
were so many closets and drawers in which 
to pack away things. Bridget had scoured
