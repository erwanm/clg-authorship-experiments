quiet voice. 

"But if your physical strength should get exhausted too 
soon ?" with a look of intense anxiety. 

"It will not. Do not feel troubled about me, dear 
friend." 

She listened when he spoke of Victor, but asked no ques 
tions. It seemed quite impossible to rouse her to any warm, 
human interest ; and Trewartha had a wild fear that her 
mother's death would snap the frail chords that bound her to 
earth. 

The blow was mercifully sudden. Mrs. Redmond would 
hear nothing of death, and seemed to shrink from it with a 
peculiar horror. It was well, therefore, that the closing pang 
should be brief. 

They laid her beside her husband one dull, lowering Feb- 



 

ruary cKv, as if in keeping with the shady part of her life, now 
gone up to be judged of God. 

Sylvia was unnaturally grave and composed, and rode back 
with her cousins. But Trewartha followed her to the sitting- 
room before she could divest herself of her wrappings. 

"I am to be master, now," and an under-current of power 
that she had no strength to resist floated in with the words 
from his strong, tender tone. "You need a change, or I will 
not answer for your life." 

' ' Does it matter much ?" in her weary manner. 

"I think it does. Miss Rachel, you will trust me, I know." 

He carried her down to his own light wagon that stood at 
the gate, and wrapped her well with the robes. Then touch 
ing the coal-black horses, they were off like the wind. Sylvia 
was forced to gasp for breath ; and the exertion brought a tint 
of color to her pale lips, though the white face looked very 
wan and tired. 

He paused at length at Cragness. She would fain have 
resisted, but he lifted her out, led her up the broad steps with 
his strong arm around her, the small feet barely touching 
the ground. 

"Friend Janet," he exclaimed, "here is a work and a 
duty to bring this bit of marble back to the rosy flesh and 
blood we found here a year ago. " 

Only a year ! Sylvia shivered. It seemed ten at least. 

Ruth came over, her slow-moving eyes full of tender pity, 
and began to unfasten the wraps as if Sylvia had been a 
baby. 

' ' You will care for her tenderly.'' 

If he had asked Ruth Gamier to walk to the mouth of a 
fiery, burning crater, she would have obeyed. 

"Child, there has been many a sad hour in the year," and 
Janet McRae drew her down to the ample lap, and pressed hei 
to the beating heart still firm and strong; "but, please God, 
there will be sunshine again." 



 

"Never for me," the aching heart cried inwardly. 

The change did not come a moment too soon. For a 
week Sylvia wavered, lying on the sofa most of the time, 
brightening only through Trewartha's visits. 

Ruth watched them with a peculiar fascination. Why had 
she felt so much more satisfied and at ease when she heard 
that Sylvia was to marry Eustace Gilliat ? What pain was this 
running through her pulses like a bit of fie ry, jagged light 
ning ? 

And as Sylvia gained she began to lose. For presently a 
gleam of health shone in the eyes, and the hollow cheeks 
began to round to their olden -contour. The little hands no 
longer shook like a stray leaf in the autumn blast, but had a 
firm, warm clasp of their own. And hers were always cold 
now, save for these fitful flashes. 

She tried to think how it would be. Especially one day, 
when Doctor Trewartha took them both over to the Cedars to 
lunch. She sat at the head of the table after a little demur, but 
it was to Sylvia he talked, and Sylvia who gave back sweet, 
dainty, answering smiles. What was it that made women loved 
so easily, that thrust the less fortunate ones aside? 

Sylvia ran over the house and exhumed mines of treasures, 
questioned, teased, thereby giving out glimpses of her olden 
self. Was it because she was tired that she should pause 
presently before the wide grate, and slip into a great cushioned 
chair, where Trewartha found her, with her eyes shut but not 
asleep, the firelight crowning her drooping head ? 

The fitful March day had vibrated from gusts to sunshine. 
Now a flurry of snow thickened the air and made a kind of 
hoar twilight. 

Trewartha went in search of Ruth, who was standing alone 
by the great basin of lilies, herself as white as they, save the 
crown of dusky hair. 

"Come," he said. 

She turned with a sharp pain. Would they not let her have 



 

a moment in which she could escape from the vivid picture of 
their love and happiness? And then she shook her head. 

" Go to Sylvia," she cried, with sudden heat and emphasis. 

"Sylvia is resting, curled up in a great chair like a kitten. 
Will you come and look at her ?" 

He reached over for her hand. It was cold and passive, and 
the lips trembled. 

" I will not disturb her," she said. "Go yourself." 

He laughed low and provokingly, reading what she thought 
so securely hidden. 

"Why are your hands so cold? And why are you pale 
and grave? Has the winter taken away your warmth and 
bloom ?" 

"You hurt me!" as his clasp tightened. "I came here 
to be alone, to think " 

"And of what avail is the endless thinking? Does it 
bring you any nearer the great truth ? Why do you not open 
the eyes of your soul, of your spirit ?" 

"Because I was born blind !" passionately. 

" No, you were not. No woman ever is until she makes 
some black, wilful blindness for herself. Look up at me, Ruth. 
Can you read any secret in my face ?" 

A faint color stirred in ,hers and the lips trembled. Then
