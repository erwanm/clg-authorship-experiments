Ellen promised, a good deal gratified at her aunt's last 
words ; and once more asked if she could do anything for 
her. 

"I don't know !" said Miss Fortune, flinging herself 
back on her pillow ; — " I don't care what you do, if you only 
keep the house clear. There's the clothes in the basket 
under the table down stairs — you might begin to iron 'em ; 
they're only rough dry. But don't come asking me about 
anything ; I can't bear it. — Ellen, don't let a soul go into the 
buttery except yourself. — And Ellen ! I don't care if you 
make me a little catnip tea ; — the catnip's up in the store- 
room, — the furthest door in the back attic — here's the keys. 
Don't go to fussing with anything else there." 

Ellen thought the prospect before hel* rather doleful 
when she reached the kitchen. It was in order, to be sure, 
and clean ; but it looked as if the mistress was away. The 
fire had gone out, the room was cold ; even so little a matter 
as catnip tea seemed a thing far off and hard to come by. 
While she stood looking at the great logs in the fireplace, 
which she could hardly move, and thinking it was rather a 
dismal state of things, in came Mr. Van Bnmt with his good- 
natured face, and wanted to know if he could do anything for 
her. The very room seemed more comfortable as soon as his 
big figure was in it. He set about kindling the fire forthwith, 
while Ellen went up to the storeroom. A well-filled store- 
room ! Among other things, there hung at least a dozen 
bunches of dried herbs from one of the rafters. Ellen thought 
she knew catnip, but after smelling of two or three she became utterly puzzled and was fain to carry a leaf of several 
kinds down to Mr. Van Brunt to find out which was which. 
When she came down again she found he had hung on the 

 





kettle for her, and swept up the hearth ; so Ellen, wisely 
thinking it best to keep busy, put the ironing blanket on the 
table, and folded the clothes, and set the irons to the fire. 
By this time the kettle boiled. How to make catnip tea 
Ellen did not exactly know, but supposed it must follow the 
same rules as black tea, in the making of which she felt herself very much at home. So she put a pinch or two of 
catnip leaves into the pot, poured a little water on them, and 
left it to draw. Meanwhile came in kind Mr. Van Brunt with 
an armfull or two of small short sticks for the fire, which 
Ellen could manage. 

" I wish I could stay here and take care of you all the 
while," said he ; " but I'll be round. If you want anything 
you must come to the door and holler." 

Ellen began to thank him. 

" Just don't say anything about that," said he, moving his 
hands as if he were shaking her thanks out of them ; "I'd 
back all the wood you could burn every day for the pleasure 
of having you hum again, if I didn't know you was better 
where you was; but I can't help that. Is'ow, who am I 
going to get to stay with you ? Who would you like to have." 

" Nobody, if you please, Mr. Van Brunt," said Ellen ; 
" aunt Fortune don't wish it, and I had rather not, indeed." 

He stood up and looked at her in amazement. 

" Why you don't mean to say," said he, " that you are 
thinking, or she is thinking, you can get along here alone 
without help ?" 

" I'll get along somehow," said Ellen. " Never mind, 
please let me, Mr. Van Brunt ; it would worry aunt Fortune 
very much to have anybody ; don't say anything about it." 

''Worry her!" said he ; and he muttered something Ellen 
did not quite understand, about bringing the old woman to 
reason." 

However he went off for the present ; and Ellen filled up 
her teapot and carried it up stairs. Her old grandmother was 
awake ; before, when Ellen w as in the room, she had been 
napping ; now she showed the greatest delight at seeing her ; 
fondled her, kissed her, cried over her, and finally insisted 
on getting up directly and going down stairs. Ellen received and returned her caresses with great tenderness, and 
then began to help her to rise and dress. 







" Yes, do," said Miss Fortune ; " I shall have a little betier 
chance of sleeping-. My stars ! Ellen, what do you call this ?" 
Isn't it catnip ?" said Ellen, alarmed. 

" Catnip ! it tastes of nothing but the teakettle. It's as 
weak as dish water. Take it down and make some more. 
How much did you put in ? you want a good double hand- 
ful, stalks and all ; make it strong. I can't drink such stuff 
as that. I think if I could get into a sweat I should be better." 

Ellen went down, established her grandmother in her old 
corner, and made some more tea. Then, her irons being hot, 
she began to iron ; doing double duty at the same time, for 
Mrs. Montgomery had one of her talking fits on, and it was 
necessary to hear and answer a great many things. Presently 
the first visiter appeared in the shape of Nancy. 

" Well, Ellen !" said she ; " so Miss Fortune is really sick 
for once, and you are keeping house. Aint you grand !" 

I don't feel very grand," said Ellen. " I don't know 
what is the matter with these clothes ; I cannot make 'em look 
smooth." 

" Irons aint hot," said Nancy. 

" Yes they are, too hot. I've scorched a towel already." 

" My goodness, Ellen ! I guess you have. If Miss Fortune 
was down you'd get it. Why they're bone dry !" said 
Nancy, plunging her hand into the basket ; — you haven't 
sprinkled 'em, have you ?" 

"To be sure," said Ellen, with an awakened face, " I forgot it !" 

" Here, get out of the way, I do it for you," said Nancy, 
rolling up her sleeves and pushing Ellen from the table ; 
" you just get me a bowl of water, will you, and we'll have 
'em done in no time. Who's a-coming to help you ?" 

" Nobody." 

" Nobody ! — you poor chicken ; do you think you're agoing 
to do all the work of the house yourself?" 

" No," said Ellen, " but I can do a good deal, and the rest 
will have to go." 

" You aint going to do no such a thing ; I'll stay myself." 

" No you can't, Nancy," said Ellen, quietly. 

" I guess I will if I've a mind to. I should like to know 
how you'd help it ; Miss Fortune's abed." 







" I could help it though," said Ellen ; " but I am sure you 
won't when I ask you not." 

" I'll do anything you please," said Nancy, " if you'll get 
Miss Fortune to let me stay. Come do, Ellen ! It will be
