to carry out a plan she had long had, to delight the whole 
family with some eggs scrambled in Margery's fashion ; 
after the milk was strained and put away she went about it, 
while Nancy set the table. A nice bed of coals was prepared ; the spider set over them ; the eggs broken in, peppered and salted ; and she began carefully to stir them as 
she had seen Margery do. But instead of acting right the 
eggs maliciously stuck fast to the spider and burned. Ellen 
was confounded. 

" How much butter did you put in ?" said Mr. Yan Brunt, 
who had come in, and stood looking on. 

" Butter !" said Ellen looking up, — " I forgot all about 
it ! — I ought to have put that in, oughtn't I ? — I'm sorry !" 

" Never mind," said Mr. Van Brunt, — 't aint worth your 
being sorry about. Here Nancy — clean us off this spider, 
and we'll try again." 

At this moment Miss Fortune was heard screaming ; Ellen 
ran up. 

What did she v>^ant?" said Mr. Van Brunt when she 
came down again. 

" She wanted to know what was burning." 
" Did you tell her ?" 







" Yes." 

"Well what did she say?" 

" Said I mustn't use any more eggs without asking her." 

" That aint fair play," said Mr. Van Brunt ; — " you and I 
are the head of the house now, I take it. You just use as 
many on 'em as you've a mind ; and all you spile I'll fetch 
you again from hum. 'i hat's you, Nancy ! Now Ellen, 
here's the spider ; try again ; let's have plenty of butter in 
this time, and plenty of eggs too." 

This time the eggs were scrambled to a nicety, and the 
supper met with great favor from all parties. 

Ellen's day was done when the dishes were. The whole 
family went early to bed. She was weary ; — but she could 
rest well. She had made her old grandmother comfortable ; 
she had kept the peace with Nancy ; she had pleased Mr. 
Van Brunt ; she had faithfully served her aunt. Her sleep 
was uncrossed b};- a dream, untroubled by a single jar of 
conscience. And her awaking to another day of labor, 
thougli by no means joyful, was yet not vmhopeful or un- 
happy. 

She had a hard trial a day or two after. It was in the 
end of the afternoon, she had her big apron on, and was in 
the buttery skimming the milk, when she heard the kitchen 
door open, and footsteps enter the kitchen. Out went 
little Ellen to see who it was, and there stood Alice and old 
Mr. Marshman! He was going to take Alice home with 
him' the next morning, and wanted Ellen to go too ; and they 
had come to ask her. Ellen knew it was impossible, that is, 
that it would not be right, and she said so ; and in spite of 
Alice's wistful look, and Mr. Marshman's insisting, she stood 
her ground. Not without some difficulty, and some glisten- 
ing of the eyes. They had to give it up. Mr. Marshman 
then wanted to know what she meant by swallowing hei'self 
up in an apron in that sort of a way ? so Ellen had him into 
the buttery and showed him what she had been about. He 
would see her skim several pans, and laughed at her pro- 
digiously ; though there was a queer look about his eyes, 
too, all the time. And when he went away, he held her in 
his arms, and kissed her again and again ; and said that some 
of these days he would take her away from her aunt, and she 
should have her no more." Ellen stood and looked aftei 





them till they were out of sight, and then went up staiis 
and had a good cry. 

Tlie butter-making soon became quite too much for Ellen to 
manage ; so Jane Huff and Jenny Hitchcock were engaged 
to come by turns and do the heavy part of it ; all within the 
buttery being still left to Ellen, for Miss Fortune would have 
no one else go there. It was a great help to have them 
take even so much off her hands ; and they often did some 
other little odd jobs for her. The milk however seemed to 
increase as fast as the days grew longer, and Ellen could not 
find that she was much less busy. The days were growing 
pleasant too ; soft airs began to come ; the grass was of a 
beautiful green ; the buds on the branches began to swell, and 
on some trees to put out. When Ellen had a moment of 
time she used to run across the chip-yard to the barn, or 
round the garden, or down to the brook, and drink in the 
sweet air and the lovely sights which never had seemed 
quite so lovely before. If once in a while she could get half 
an hour before tea, she used to take her book and sit down 
on the threshold of the front door, or on the big log under 
the apple-tree in the chip-yard. In those minutes the 
reading was doubly sweet ; or else the loveliness of earth 
and sky was such that Ellen could not take her eyes from 
them ; till she saw Sam or Johnny coming out of the cow- 
house door with the pails of milk, or heard their heavy 
tramp over the chips ; — then she had to jump and run. 
Those were sweet half hours. Ellen did not at first know 
how much reason she had to be delighted with her " Pilgrim's Progress ;" she saw to be sure that it was a fine copy, 
well bound, with beautiful cuts. But when she came to 
look further, she found all through the book, on the margin 
or at the bottom of the leaves, in John's beautiful hand- 
writing, a great many notes ; simple, short, plain, exactly 
what was needed to open the whole book to her and make 
it of the greatest possible use and pleasure. Many things 
she remembered hearing from his lips when they were reading it together ; there was a large part of the book where 
all was new; the part he had not had time to finish. How 
Ellen loved the book and the giver when she found these 
beautiful notes, it is impossible to tell. She counted it her
greatest treasure next to her little red Bible. 



CHAPTER XXXVI. 




In the course of time Miss Fortune showed signs of mending ; and, at last, towards the latter end of April, she was 
able to come down stairs. All parties hailed this event for 
different reasons ; even Nancy was grown tired of her regular 
life, and willing to have a change. Ellen's joy was, "however, 
soon diminished by the terrible rummaging which took place. 
Miss Fortune's hands were yet obliged to lie still, but her 
eyes did double duty ; they were never known to be idle in 
the best of times, and it seemed to Ellen now as if they were 
taking amends for all their weeks of forced rest. Oh, those 
eyes ! Dust was found where Ellen never dreamed of looking for any ; things were said to be dreadfully " in the way" 
where she had never found it out ; disorder and dirt were 
groaned over, where Ellen did not know the fact or was 
utterly ignorant how to help it ; waste was suspected where 
none had been, and carelessness charged where rather praise 
was due. Impatient to have things to her mind, and as yet 
unable to do anything herself, Miss Fortune kept Nancy and 
Ellen running, till both wished her back in bed ; and even Mr. 
Van Brunt grumbled that " to pay Ellen for having grown 
white and poor, her aunt was going to work the little flesh 
she had left off her bones." It was rather hard to bear, just 
when she was looking for ease too ; her patience and temper 
were more tried than in all those weeks before. But if there 
was small pleasure in pleasing her aunt, Ellen did earnestly 
wish to please God ; she struggled against ill temper, prayed 
against it ; and though she often blamed herself in secret, she
