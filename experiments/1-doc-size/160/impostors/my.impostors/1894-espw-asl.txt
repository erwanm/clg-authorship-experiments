“He don’t scare worth a cent,” thought Ben. Aloud he said:--

“So you’re goin’ to fight us, be you?”

“Till I die,” answered Bayard solemnly; “and if I die!”

“You won’t take no warnin’ then?” asked Ben with a puzzled air.

“Neither from you, Ben, nor from any other man.”

“The worse for you, then!” returned Ben in an ugly tone.

“I’ll risk it,” replied Bayard serenely.

“There’s them that says you’re goin’ to fight it out at the polls,”
said Ben, more sullenly now than savagely. “Folks says you’re
goin’ to get away Father’s license.”

“I hadn’t thought of it till this minute!” exclaimed the preacher.
“But it would be a good idea.”

Ben made an inarticulate noise in his throat. Bayard instinctively
thrust out his elbow; he thought for the moment that Ben would
spring upon him out of sheer rage. They were out on the open downs,
now; but still only the witness of the sky and sea and rocks
remained to help him.

“Look here,” said Ben, suddenly stopping. “Are you going to tell of
me?”

“That you were so uncivil as to put your hands on my throat,
Ben?--I haven’t decided.”

“Not that I care a ----!” muttered Ben. “But Jane”--

“I shall never mention any circumstance of this--rather unpleasant
evening--which would bring Miss Granite’s name into publicity,”
replied the preacher quickly. “She is a good, modest girl. She
should be sheltered and cared for. You might better toss a woman
off Ragged Rock--as you intended to do by me--than to turn the
gossip of Windover loose upon her.”

“It is a hell of a town, if you come to that,” said Ben with calm
conviction.

“She is much too good for you, Ben Trawl,” remarked Bayard quite
politely, as if he were offering the other a glass of lemonade.

“Lord!” groaned Ben, writhing under the minister’s manner. “Don’t
you suppose that’s the worst on’t?”

“I think I’ll cut across here towards the hotel,” observed Bayard
pleasantly. “We seem to have talked out, for this time. Good-night,
Ben.”

“Say,” said Ben, “why don’t you spout temperance to me? Why ain’t
you talked religion? Why ain’t you set out to convert me? I give
you chance enough!”

“You are an intelligent man,” replied the preacher; “you know what
you are about. I don’t waste sacred powder on useless shot.”

“Queer Dick, you,” mused Ben. “It’s just as I said. You don’t
belong to any kind of folks I ever see before. I can’t make you
out.”

“Next time you want to murder me, Ben,” called the minister
cheerily, “don’t try anonymous traps! Show up like a man, and have
it out in the open air!”

He walked on towards the beach. Ben watched him for a perplexed and
sullen moment, then took his course thoughtfully in the direction
of the town.

When the two men had disappeared from the dark map of the downs,
a woman’s figure swiftly and quietly crossed it. Jane Granite had
followed the minister like the spaniel that she was, and, hidden
in the shadows of Ragged Rock, thinking to save him, God knew
how, from Heaven knew what fate, had overheard the interview from
beginning to end.




XVIII.


A fiery July was followed by a scorching August. There was a long
drought, and simooms of fine, irritating dust. The gasping town and
inland country flocked to the coast in more than the usual force.
The hotels brimmed over. Even Windover fanned herself, and lay in
hammocks lazily, watching for the two o’clock east wind to stir the
topsails of the schooners trying under full canvas to crawl around
the Point. In Angel Alley the heat was something unprecedented; and
the devil shook hands with discomfort as he is fain to, and made
new comrades.

Bayard was heavily overworked. He gave himself few pleasures,
after the fashion of the man; and the summer people at the Point
knew him not. He was not of them, nor of their world. Afterwards,
he recalled, with a kind of pain lacking little of anguish, how
few in number had been his evenings in the cool parlor of the
cottage, where the lace curtains blew in and out through the
purple twilight, or on the impearled harbor, in the dory, when
the sun went down, and he drifted with her between earth and
heaven, between light and reflection, in a glamour of color, in
alternations of quiet, dangerous talk, and of more dangerous
silence; brief, stolen hours when duty seemed a dimming dream, and
human joy the only reality, the sole value, the decreed and eternal
end of life. Upon this rare and scanty substitute for happiness he
fed; and from it he fled.

Between his devotions and his desertions the woman stood mute and
inscrutable. And while they still moved apart, saying, “The summer
is before us,” lo, the petals of the Cape roses had flown on the
hot winds, the goldenrod was lifting its sword of flame on the
undulating gray downs, and the summer was spent.

And yet, at every march and countermarch in the drill of duty, he
was aware of her. It could not be said that she ever overstepped
the invisible line which he had elected to draw between them;
though it might be said that she had the fine pride which did not
seem to see it. Helen had the quiet, maidenly reserve of an elder
and more delicate day than ours. To throw her young enthusiasm
into his work without obtruding herself upon his attention, was a
difficult procedure, for which she had at once the decorum and the
wit.

At unexpected crises and in unthought-of ways he came upon her
footprints or her sleight-of-hand. Helen’s methods were purely her
own. She followed neither law nor gospel; no rules or precedents
controlled her. She relieved what suffering she chose, and omitted
where she did elect; and he was sometimes astonished at the common
sense of her apparent willfulness. She had no more training in
sociological problems than the goldenrod upon the bosom of her
white gown; yet she seldom made a serious mistake. In a word, this
summer girl, playing at charity for a season’s amusement, poured
a refreshing amount of novelty, vigor, ingenuity, and feminine
defiance of routine into the labors of the lonely man. His too
serious and anxious people found her as diverting as a pretty
parlor play. A laugh ran around like a light flame whenever she
came upon the sombre scene. She took a bevy of idle girls with her,
and gave entertainments on which Angel Alley hung, a breathless
and admiring crowd. She played, she sang, she read, she decorated.
Pictures sprang on barren walls; books stood on empty shelves;
games crowded the smoking-room; a piano replaced the painstaking
melodeon; life and light leaped where she trod, into the poor and
unpopular place. The people took to her one of the strong, loyal
fancies of the coast. Unsuspected by her, or by himself, she began,
even then, to be known among them as “the minister’s girl.” But
this hurt nobody, neither herself nor him, and their deference to
her never defaulted. In the indulgence of that summer’s serious
mood, Helen seldom met, he was forced to suspect that she purposely
avoided, the preacher. Often he entered a laughing home from which
she had just vanished. Sometimes--but less often--he found that
she had preceded him where death and trouble were. Their personal
interviews were rare, and of her seeking, never.

“She is amusing herself with a novelty,” he thought. Then came the
swift, unbidden question, If this is her beautiful whim, what would
