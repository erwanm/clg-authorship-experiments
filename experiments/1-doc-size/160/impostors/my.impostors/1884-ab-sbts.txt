treat you very pleasantly," she went on. ' If I 
didn't know Grandmother so well I should think she 
couldn't help liking you. But I know she could." 

" See, here's our programme," said Oswald, after a 
minute's thought. "I'll goto the Sea View to-night. 
If you think best, I won't even walk home with you, 
and to-morrow I'll come round and lay siege to the 
Grandmother's heart. Will that do ? "' 

" Yes, I think so, better than any thing. And don't 
come any further with me, please. We are so near 
home." 

There were minutes of whispered words and fond 
looks. Elizabeth's hair curled in rings about her face; 
her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes alive from sur- 
face to depth. Oswald confided to himself, as he 
turned away, that she was an exceptional girl of rare 
possibilities, and that he was very much in love with 
her. 

There is no doubt that he was, and that circum- 
stances had conspired to make him realize the fact. 
He had put out from Scone with the fishermen, but, 
warned by the persistent rain, they had come back to 
port the same day. Oswald took a room at the little 
hotel there, and spent his days over the fire, reading a 
week-old paper and the almanac, waiting for fair 
weather. It seemed easier to do that than to make 
the exertion necessary for reaching another place, in 
the storm. 





The summer stir of life had not begun there. Only 
two boarders were at the hotel, an old lady and her 
niece, who came early every year and staid late. 
They and Oswald had the house very much to them- 
selves, and as they were not disposed to enter his field 
of vision, he found not the slightest difficulty in the 
way of becoming desperately bored. With plenty of 
time for thought, Elizabeth's charm for him was not 
broken by absence. It grew as, in the lack of other 
employment, he endeavored to analyze it, until he 
found it impossible to wait for fair weather before go- 
ing back to her. And now, this finding her willing to 
own she loved him had all the sweetness anticipation 
had promised, which was, for him, something remark- 
able. 

The next morning, with the pleasant sense of a vic- 
tory to be won, he went to make his call on Madam 
Nye. She was alone, and knitting. Elizabeth had 
told her mother how it had happened, and Mrs. Nye, 
with the true maternal gladness of a woman who had 
been happy in her own married life, showed a deeper 
tenderness than Elizabeth had ever seen in her. She 
had no thought yet of that .sweet selfishness which will 
not let a mother give up her child without a pang. 

' If he's coming to-morrow, we'd better keep out of 
the way," she said. " I should rather he'd see Grand- 
mother alone. I'm sure I can't imagine what she'll say ! " 

But Elizabeth, quite at rest now that Oswald had 
come back, did not care. A great love seemed omnipo- 
tent, its shelter second only to that of the heavenly 
powers. So, while her mother was pale and nervous, 
she felt only a proud joyousness. 



 

Oswald's manner showed a quiet gravity when he 
came in at the open door, and, without knocking, enter- 
ed the sitting-room. 

' I hoped to find you alone, Madam Nye," he began, 
with not too great an effusion of cordiality. " My call 
was intended for you, in fact." 

Grandmother, who was apparently quite unconscious 
of his entrance, anwound some yarn from her ball, and 
put her needle in, before looking up. 

Well, what is it ? " she asked monotonously. 
' You remember me, perhaps ? " said Oswald, ventur- 
ing to take a chair, and drawing it near her. " I had 
the pleasure of seeing you last winter." 

Madam Nye would waste no time in vague plati- 
tudes ; they were always frivolous, and, from Oswald 
especially, not to be borne. 

' Did you say you wanted to see me ? " she asked, 
the click of her needles growing more steady, "If it's 
about your clothes, I believe they're where you left 
'em. Philip 'll help you fetch the trunk down stairs." 

Oswald realized that a circuitous mode of attack 
would not do. ' No, it is not my trunk. I came to ask 
your consent to my marrying your granddaughter." 
Then, indeed, Grandmother laid down her work. 

'' I've no time to talk nonsense," she said. '' Eliza- 
beth never will marry a man like you. What have you 
got to support her on ? Where did the money come 
from ? " 

Oswald went on, with unmoved fluency. " I can't 
give you the precise figure of my income, at such short 
notice, but I assure you it is a comfortable one. As 
for the cleanness of the money, my father gave it to me 



unconditionally and without explanation. Can I say 
more than that ? ' 

"Yes," said Grandmother, a faint flush appearing 
high on her cheeks. ' You can tell me whether you've 
got the name of an honest man to offer. Like father, 
like son. I wouldn't have trusted your father, and I 
won't see you Elizabeth's husband." 

The most successful diplomacy sometimes demands 
a bold push. 

' Elizabeth has promised to marry me," said Oswald, 
in his quietest voice. '' I know she wont break her 
word. If you think there's any thing questionable 
about my right to the house opposite, I shall be very 
glad to give my wife the deed of it." 

With such great issues at stake, the offer seemed 
lightening the load of her aversion by a straw's weight 
only, and yet, she felt that it was not a bad thing to 
say. But she loved Elizabeth with all the hidden 
strength of her heart ; better, now, than any thing 
except the memory of her dead son. She could not 
see her sacrificed in a marriage founded on wrong. 

' Elizabeth, come here," she called, hearing a step 
in the kitchen, and as the girl appeared, she cried with 
real feeling, " Elizabeth, you'll do what I tell you, wont 
you ? I know what will be best. You can't marry him." 
But she noted with a sinking heart how, when Elizabeth 
turned to her lover, a flush rose in her face, and the 
tenderest of slight smiles came. The two did not 
speak, but Oswald rose and kept her hand while she 
answered: 'I told you I cared for him, Grandmother. 
I do care very much. It is best for me to do what he 
says." Oswald flashed such a glad smile at her that
