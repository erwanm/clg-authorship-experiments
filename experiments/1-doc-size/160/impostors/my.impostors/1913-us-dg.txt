on my savings as long as I could; then I 
had to leave my baby in a foundling's 
home, and I went out to do my five hours 
on the boulevards. You know the game, 
I've no doubt." 

Yes, George knew the game. Somehow 
or other he no longer felt bitter towards 
this poor creature. She was part of the 



 

system of which he was a victim also. 
There was nothing to be gained by hating 
each other. Just as the doctor said, what 
was needed was enlightenment. " Listen' 
he said, ''why don't you try to get cured?" 

''I haven't got the price," was the 
answer. 

''Well," he said, hesitatingly, ''I know 
a doctor — one of the really good men. He 
has a free clinic, and I've no doubt he 
would take you in if I asked him to." 

'' You ask him?" echoed the other, looking 
at George in surprise. 

The young man felt somewhat uncom- 
fortable. He was not used to playing the 
role of the good Samaritan. ''I — I need 
not tell him about us," he stammered. 
''I could just say that I met you. I have 
had such a wretched time myseK, I feel 
sorry for anybody that's in the same plight. 
I should Hke to help you if I could." 

The girl sat staring before her, lost in 
thought. ''I have treated you badly, I 
guess," she said. '' I'm sorry. I'm ashamed 
of myself." 

George took a pencil and paper from his 

 



 

pocket and wrote the doctor's address. 
''Here it is' he said, in a business-Hke 
way, because he felt that otherwise he could 
become sentimental. He was half tempted 
to tell the woman what had happened to 
him, and all about Henriette and the sick 
child; but he realized that that would not 
do. So he rose and shook hands with her 
and left. 

The next time he saw the doctor he 
told him about this girl. He decided to 
tell him the truth — Shaving already made 
so many mistakes trying to conceal things. 
The doctor agreed to treat the woman, 
making the condition that George promise 
not to see her again. 

The young man was rather shocked at 
this. "Doctor," he exclaimed, ''I assure 
you you are mistaken. The thing you have 
in mind would be utterly impossible.'' 

"I know," said the other, "you think so. 
But I think, young man, that I know more 
about life than you do. When a man and a 
woman have once committed such a sin, 
it is easy for them to slip back. The less 
time they spend talking about their mis- 



 

fortunes, and being generous and for- 
bearing to each other, the better for them 
both." 

''But, Doctor," cried George. ''I love 
Henriette! I could not possibly love any- 
one else. It would be horrible to me!" 

"Yes," said the doctor. "But you are 
not living with Henriette. You are wander- 
ing round, not knowing what to do with 
yourseK next." 

There was no need for anybody to tell 
George that. "What do you think?" he 
asked abruptly. "Is there any hope for 
me?" 

"I think there is," said the other, who, 
in spite of his resolution, had become a 
sort of ambassador for the unhappy hus- 
band. He had to go to the Loches house 
to attend the child, and so he could not 
help seeing Henriette, and talking to her 
about the child's health and her own 
future. He considered that George had 
had his lesson, and urged upon the young 
wife that he would be wiser in future, and 
safe to trust. 

George had indeed learned much. He 



 

got new lessons every time he went to call 
at the physician's office — 'he could read 
them in the faces of the people he saw there. 
One day when he was alone in the waiting- 
room, the doctor came out of his inner 
office, talking to an elderly gentleman, 
whom George recognized as the father of 
one of his classmates at college. The 
father was a little shopkeeper, and the 
young man remembered how pathetically 
proud he had been of his son. Could it be, 
thought George, that this old man was a 
victim of syphilis? 

But it was the son, and not the father, 
who was the subject of the consultation. 
The old man was speaking in a deeply 
moved voice, and he stood so that George 
could not help hearing what he said. 
'Terhaps you can't understand,'' he said, 
''just what it means to us — the hopes we 
had of that boy! Such a fine fellow he was, 
and a good fellow, too, sir! We were so 
proud of him; we had bled our veins to 
keep him in college — and now just see!" 

'' Don't despair, sir," said the doctor, 
"we'll try to cure him." And he added, 



 

with that same note of sorrow in his voice 
which George had heard, ''Why did you 
wait so long before you brought the boy 
to me?''
