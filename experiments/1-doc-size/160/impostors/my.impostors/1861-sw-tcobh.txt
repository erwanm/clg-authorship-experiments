“Oh, a very nice time,” said Jane; 



“and here’s some cake for you, mother 
And I walked with such a nice little girl in 
red shoes. They looked so pretty, mother, 
you can’t think!” 

Her mother looked down at Jane’s little 
bare feet, and said nothing. 



CHAPTER IV. 

It was the next day after the strawberry 
feast, and Debby Delaine and her mother 
sat at work in the front porch. Debby 
thought she was at work; but indeed it 
was only an apron for her doll; and, as 
the doll was very patient and willing to 
wait, there was really no hurry about it. 
So Debby sewed a little, and then she 
laid down the apron and played with the 
eat. And presently puss began to bite 
Debby ’s shoes. Debby watched her. The 
black shoes were on to-day, or, you may 
be sure, Debby would have stopped the 
cat’s sport quick enough. 

“Mother,” she said, suddenly, “I wish 
you would tell me more about the little 




travellers. The next verse says, ‘ who are 
they?'” 

“ Take notice, first,” said her mother, 
“that they who reach that heavenly seat 
have been journeying on towards it peeping 
it in view all the time. They have not been 
turning their backs on the Celestial City, 
so that it should be a surprise and a new 
idea to find themselves there.” 

“What does ‘facing’ mean?” said 
Debby?” 

“In this place it means going along, 
step by step. That is the way people follow Jesus towards heaven, Debby, — step 
by step. And sometimes the steps are 
very little ones; but they are all after 
him.” 

“The hymn says, ‘their little feet,’ ” 
said Debby, looking down at her own 
small, black shoes, on which pussy had laid 
her white paws. 


“ Yes ; their little feet,” said her mother. 
“Oh, how many little feet are even now 
treading those heavenly courts ! And how 
many more are on the way ! And you 
see, Debby, they come from all parts of 
the world : — 



‘I from Greenland’s frozen land 
' I from India’s sultry plain 
'I from Afric’s barren sand ;’ 

‘ I from islands of the main.’ ” 

“ All these far-away places,” said Debby. 

“Yes,” said her mother, “very far 
away from us, and from each other, but 
not from heaven. Heaven is near every 
part of the world to those who follow 
Jesus. And then, when their earthly 
journey is all past, the little travellers 
will all meet together at those heavenly 
gates.” 

“And the gates will let ’em come in,” 
said Debby. “ The hymn says so.” 


 


“Oh, yes,” said her mother, “and the 
Bible says so too: — ‘Open ye the gates, 
that the righteous nation which keepeth 
the truth may enter in.’ And who will 
welcome them, Debby?” 

“The Lord Jesus, first,” said Debby. 

‘There, to welcome, Jesus waits, — 

Gives the crowns his followers win.’ ” 

“Then they will be welcomed and 
crowned by Jesus!” said Mrs. Delaine. 
“Will not that be a reward for a weary 
little traveller?” 

“Will they be weary ?” said Debby. 

“ Some of them will be weary,” her 
mother answered. “ Look at Jane King, 
Debby: don’t you think she sometimes 
gets weary of going barefoot, and of having little to eat, and not much fire in 
the cold weather, and having to work 
hard?” 



“I don’t know,” said Debby. “She 
didn’t look so.” 

“Then, if all that does not trouble her,” 
said Mrs. Delaine, “I can tell you what 
she does get weary of sometimes. Of 
not loving Jesus enough, — of being but 
a poor, unfaithful little traveller, after 
all.” 

“Oh, I guess that’s true,” said Debby. 
‘ ‘ She said something like that. 

“And what does the last verse mean, 
when it says, — 

‘Each the welcome ‘Come’ awaits’? 



What does the Bible tell about that?” 

“ I don’t know, mother,” said Debby. 

“If you turn to the twenty-fifth chapter 
of Matthew,” said her mother, “you will 
find that it tells about a day when the Son 
of Man (that means the Lord Jesus, you 
know, Debby) shall come in his glory. 




When he came to this world before, it 
was in poverty and humiliation; but the 
next time it shall be ‘in his glory, and
