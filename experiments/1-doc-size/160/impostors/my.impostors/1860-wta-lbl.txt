"We will." 

" And obey the orders of Captain Gordon in 
all things, whether you are on board or on shore ? " 

"We will," replied all the boys at once. 

" Very well ; I shall trust you. If I return 
soon enough to join you at Portsmouth, I shall 
do so. Good by, now, and a pleasant cruise to 
you ; " and Captain Littleton went over the side. 

" Good by, sir," replied the crew. 

"That's first rate — isn't it?" whispered Tom 



 

Nettle, as the captain departed. " I am glad he 
isn't going." 

" So am I," replied Frank Thompson. 

" We shall not have him watching ns all the 
time. Let me tell you, there is fun ahead now," 
added Thomas. 

Captain Briskett, who was to be first officer of 
the Flyaway, as well as pilot, summoned them io 
the windlass to heave up the anchor ; and in a 
few minutes the yacht was standing down the 
harbor under all sail. The Teneans gave three 
rousing cheers, and then distributed themselves in 
various parts of the deck to enjoy the exciting 
scene. 

'' All hands aft," said Captain Gordon, when 
the yacht had reached the open bay. 

"Ay, ay, sir," replied several, as the crew took 
their places in the standing room. 

" Now, boys, we must make our arrangements. 

When a ship goes to sea, it is customary to 

divide the crew into two watches. I shall take 

the starboard watch, and Captain Briskett the lar- 


 

board. Each of us will choose a man in his turn 
till all are taken." 

"Go on," said Captain Briskett. 

" Henry Littleton," replied the skipper- 

"Paul Duncan," added the pilot. 

And so they proceeded till all the boys were 
chosen, except John, who resented the slight thus 
put upon him. To satisfy him, therefore, he was 
taken into the captain's watch. 

" There are only eight berths in the cabin, 
boys, and you must draw lots for them," contin- 
ued the master; "but they are all wide enough 
to hold two each. Now, if you want to pair off, 
you can do so." 

Lots were drawn, and Paul and Henry were to 
occupy the same berth. Again John found him- 
self thrown out of the calculation ; but the captain 
said he would make a bed for him on a locker, 
and he was satisfied. The boys then went below 
to see their berths, which had all been numbered 
for the occasion. 



 



CHAPTER XVI. 

PAUL WITNESSES A MUTINY. 

« When the Flyaway had passed Farm Island, 
and reached the fishing ground, she lay to, for 
the purpose of enabling the crew to catch a few 
cod and haddock, for the chowder and fry. But 
cod and haddock are singularly obstinate at times, 
and persistently refuse to appreciate the angler's 
endeavors in their behalf They were so on the 
present occasion, and it was two hours before the 
chief of the culinary department could say there 
were enough to satisfy the ravenous appetites of 
the sixteen persons on board. Some of the boys 
had actually decided that fishing was a nuisance, 
but they were just as fond of chowder as those 
who enjoyed the fun even of catching only one 
fish per hour. 

As fast as they were caught, Dick aressed them 



 

and prepared them for the chowder pot or the 
frying pan. There were some queer fish caught, 
including quite a number of sculpins, " a wolfer 
eel," — so Captain Briskett called him, — and a 
large catfish. The latter was an ugly monster, 
having dangerous-looking teeth, with which he 
laid hold of every thing that came in his way. 
There was also in the collection a large scate, or 
ray, which called forth some rather large fish 
stories from the two experienced skippers on 
board. 

As the culinary department was How supplied, 
the yacht stood away for Gloucester, which was 
to be her first port. They had a fine wind, and 
before the chowder was ready, the Flyaway was 
in sight of the Reef of Norman's Woe. 

" Dinner is ready," said Dick, at last, for the 
stomachs of the boys had been in a state of re- 
bellion for two hours. 

There was a grand rush for the cabin ; but, to 
the astonishment of the hungry crew, Captain 
Gordon placed himself at the companion way, and 




would not permit a single one of them to go 
below, 

" That's not the way to do on board ship," 
said he. " Are you all going below at once ? " 

"Why not?" asked Tom Nettle. 

" Suppose we should have occasion to tack, or 
to take in sail in a hurry ? Have we got to wait 
for you to finish your plate of chowder ? " 

"We are all as hungry as bears, Captain Gor- 
don," added Frank Thompson. " We can't stand 
it any longer."
