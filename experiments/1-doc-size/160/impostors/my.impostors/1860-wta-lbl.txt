at the cove, I will be just as much obliged to 

you as though you carried me all the way to 

the Point." 

'' Let's not back out, Tom." 

" I don't back out ; and I'm sure you don't." 

" It looks a little like backing out to give up 

the chase." 

"You ought to be satisfied, if I am." 

" I shan't be satisfied till I land you at the 

Point." 

"Come, come, Paul, don't carry the joke too 

far. The sea is gettifig heavier and heavier, and 

the windows a young hurricane." 

" O, well, if you really want to back out, I'm 

willing." 


'' I don't want to do any thing of the sort. If 
you think I can't stand it as long as you can, 
you are mistaken," replied Thomas, proudly ; and 
taking the dipper, he continued to bale out the 
water, whistling an air to indicate his indifference 
to the perils that surrounded them. 

" Put her through, then ; we shan't be much 
longer, if we don't get swamped." 

The boat was now standing out from the shore, 
and while Thomas was still busy, whistling off 
his fears, a violent gust of wind struck the sail, 
causing the boat to heel over so far that she 
drank up several buckets of water, and would 
have filled if the sprit had not broken, thus removing the pressure. 

" Come, Paul, I have got enougli of this," cried 
Thomas, uneasily. 

" I don't think you will be able to get any 
more of it, for the sprit has snapped, and we 
can't carry sail any longer," replied Paul, apparently unmoved by the accident. " Bale her out 
as fast as you can, and I will take an oar, 
and keep her head up to the sea," 



 

'' What will you do now ? " asked Thomas, 
whose courage was sorely tried by the perilous 
situation of the boat. 

" Get the water out, and we will see what can 
be done,"' answered Paul, who, though he had 
already decided this important question, would 
not permit his passenger to enter into his coun- 
sels, preferring to tantalize him by his mysteri- 
ous manner. 

" Let us get ashore, Paul, as soon as possible." 

'' Going to back out?" 

"No; what's the use of talking in that way, 
about backing out, when you can't carry sail ? " 
replied Thomas, whose pride was still uncon- 
quered, though his courage was rapidly failing 
him. 

" I shall rig a new sprit ; there's the boat-hook, 
which will make a very good one ; it is just the 
right length." 

'' I'll give up then, and back out," said Thomas, 
despairing of any relief from the misfortunes that 
had beMlen the boat. 




"Don't back out on my account; I will jut 
you ashore at the Point, if you say the word," 
replied Paul, satisfied noy that he had kept his 
promise and given his friend enough of it. 
" Run for the shore, Paul." 

"Just as you say;" and the boatman, proud 
of the triumph he had won over his boastful 
companion, turned the boat's head towards the 
shore. 

The corner of the sail hung dpwn for the want 
of a sprit to support it, but as they had the wind 
free, there was canvas enough to drive her rap- 
idly towards the shore. While they were still 
half a mile from the cove, Thomas called Paul's 
attention to a horse and chaise on the beach, 
from which a man was making violent gestures 
for them to come ashore. 




CHAPTER III. 

PAUL HEARS BAD NEWS. 

"Who is it, Tom?" asked Paul, very anxiously. 

"I don't know; can't make him out." 

" What can he want with us ? " 

'' Perhaps your mother has sent him after her 
runaway boy; but whoever he is, I will tell him 
you are a fellow of the right spunk." 

" Who can it be ? " 

"What matter who it is? Your mother won't 
whip you â€” will she?" 

"No, of course not. My mother don't whip 

me." 

" I thought she did, you seem so much afraid 

of her." 

" I am not afraid of her." 

"If you are, there is nothing else that can 
frighten you." 



 

'' I mind my mother because slie is my mother; 
because I like to do so, and not because I am 
afraid of her. You had better not say much more 
about being afraid, Tom." 

" Do you mean to say I was afraid ? " said 
Thomas, smartly.
