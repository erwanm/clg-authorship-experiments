'Yet you imagined the fable yourself, when you likened me to a palm and
to a tower. But I am no lover of allegories. The sword is my argument,
and my wit is in my arm. The wall by the tree is the wall of love, and
the chief foundation of the tower is the love of Zehowah. If you destroy
that, the tree will wither and the tower will fall.'

'Surely there was never such a man as you,' Zehowah answered, half
jesting but half in earnest. 'You are as one who has bought a white
mare; and though she is fleet, and good to look at, and obedient to his
voice and knee, yet he is discontented because she cannot speak to him,
and he would fain have her black instead of white, and if possible would
teach her to sing like a Persian nightingale.'

'Is it then not natural in a woman to love man? Have you heard no tales
of love from the story-tellers of the harem?'

'I have heard many such tales, but none of them were told of me,'
Zehowah replied. 'Will you drink again? Is the drink too sweet, or is it
not cool?'

She had risen from her seat and held the golden cup, bending down to
him, so that her face was near his. He laid his hand upon her shoulder.

'Hear me, Zehowah,' he said. 'I want but one thing in the world, and it
was for that I came out of the Red Desert to be your husband. And that
thing I will have, though the price be greater than rubies, or than
blood, or than life itself.'

'If it is mine, I freely give it to you. If it is not mine, take it by
force, or I will help you to take it by a stratagem, if I can. Am I not
your wife?'

She spoke thus, supposing from his face that he meant some treasure that
could be taken by strength or by wile, for she could not believe a man
could speak so seriously of a mere thought such as love.

'Neither my right hand nor your wit can give me this, but only your
heart, Zehowah,' he answered, still holding her and looking at her.

But now she did not laugh, for she saw that he was greatly in earnest.

'You are still talking of love,' she said. 'And you are not jesting. I
do not know what to answer you. Gladly will I say, I love you. Is that
all? What is it else? Are those the words?'

'I care little for the words. But I will have the reality, though it
cost your life and mine.'

'My life? Will you take my life, for the sake of a thought?'

'A thought!' he exclaimed. 'Do you call love a thought? I had not
believed a woman could be so cold as that.'

'If not a thought, what then? I have spoken the truth. If it were a
treasure, or anything that can be taken, you could take it, and I could
help you. But if the possibility of possessing it lie not in deeds, it
lies in thoughts, and is itself a thought. If you can teach me, I will
think what you will; but if you cannot teach me, who shall? And how will
it profit you to take my life or your own?'

'Is it possible that love is only a thought?' asked Khaled, speaking
rather to himself than to her.

'It must be,' she answered. 'The body is what it is in the eyes of
others, but the soul is what it thinks itself to be, happy or unhappy,
loving or not loving.'

'You are too subtle for me, Zehowah,' Khaled said. 'Yet I know that this
is not all true.'

For he knew that he possessed no soul, and yet he loved her. Moreover he
could think himself happy or unhappy.

'You are too subtle,' he repeated. 'I will take my sword again and I
will go out and fight, and pursue the enemy and waste their country, for
it is not so hard to cut through steel as to touch the heart of a woman
who does not love, and it is easier to tear down towers and strongholds
of stone with the naked hands than to build a temple upon the moving
sand of an empty heart.'

Khaled would have risen at once, but Zehowah took his hand and entreated
him to stay with her.

'Will you go out in the heat of the day, wounded and wearied?' she
asked. 'Surely you will take a fever and die before you have followed
the Shammars so far as two days' journey.'

'My wounds are slight, and I am not weary,' Khaled answered. 'When the
smith has heated the iron in the forge, does he wait until it is cold
before striking?'

'But think also of the soldiers, who have striven hard, and cannot thus
go out upon a great expedition without preparation as well as rest.'

'I will take those whom I can find. And if they will go with me, it is
well. But if not, I will go alone, and they and the rest will follow
after.'

'It is summer, too,' said Zehowah, keeping him back. 'Is this a time to
go out into the northern desert? Both men and beasts will perish by the
way.'

'Has not Allah bound every man's fate about his neck? And can a man cast
it from him?'

'I know not otherwise, but if heat and hunger and thirst do not kill the
men, they will certainly destroy the beasts, whose names are not
recorded by Asrael, and who have no destiny of their own.'

'You hinder me,' said Khaled. 'And yet you do not know how many of the
Shammar may be yet lurking within a day's march of the city, slaying
your people, burning their houses and destroying their harvest. Let me
go. Will you love me better if I stay?'

'You will be the better able to get the victory.'

'Will you love me better if I stay?'

'If you go now, you may fail in your purpose and perish as well. How
could I love you at all then?'

'It is the victory you love then--not me?'

'Could I love defeat? Nay, do not be angry with me. Stay here at least
until the evening. Think of the burning sun and the raging thirst and
the smarting of your wounds which have only been dressed this first
time. Think of the soldiers, too----'

'They can bear what I can bear. Was it not summer-time when the Prophet
went out against the Romans?'

'I do not know. Stay with me, Khaled.'

'I will come back when I have destroyed the Shammars.'

'And if the soldiers will not go with you, will you indeed go out
alone?'

'Yes. I will go alone. When they see that they will follow me. They are
not foxes. They are brave men.'

Khaled rose and girt his sword about him. Zehowah helped him, seeing
that she could not persuade him to stay.

'Farewell,' he said, shortly, and without so much as touching her hand
he turned and went out. She followed him to the door of the room and
stood watching as he went away.

'One of us two was to rule,' she said to herself, 'and it is he, for I
cannot move him. But what is this talk of love? Does he need love, who
is himself the master?'

She sighed and went back to the carpet on which they had been sitting.
Then she called in her women and bid them tell her all they had heard
about the fight in the morning; and they, thinking to please her,
extolled the deeds of Khaled and of the tens he had slain they made
hundreds, and of the thousands of the enemy's army, they made tens of
thousands, till the walls of Riad could not have contained the hosts of
which they spoke, and the dry sand of the desert could not have drunk
