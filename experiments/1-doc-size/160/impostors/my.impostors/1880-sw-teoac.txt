Dolly started and would have freed herself, but 
she found she could not do it without making 
more effort than she was willing to use. She 
stood still, fluttering, trembling, and at the same 
time not a little abashed. 

" What is troubling you, Dolly ? " 
Dolly dared not look and could not speak. Silence made an admission, she knew; nevertheless 
she could find no words to say. 

"Don't you love me well enough to tell me?" 
"0 it isn't that," cried Dolly; "it's because " 
Here Dolly's revelations came to an end, and yet 
she had revealed a good deal. A dark glow came 
into the young officer's eyes. Truly, she had before never told him so much as that she loved 
him. But his next words were spoken in the 
same tone with the foregoing. It was very affectionate, and withal there was a certain accent 
of authority in it. I think it awed Dolly a little. 
She had known really very little of authority, as 
 



 

exercised towards herself. This was something 
very unlike her father's careless acquiescence, or 
his careless opposition; very unlike the careless 
way in which he would sometimes throw his arm 
round her, affectionate though that was. The af- 
fection here was different, Dolly felt with an odd 
sort of astonishment ; and the care, and the asserted 
right of ownership. It gave the girl a thrill of joy ; 
at the same time it had upon her a kind of sub- 
duing effect. So came his next question, gently 
as it was put, and it was put very gently. 
" Do you not think I have a right to know ? " 
"Perhaps," she stammered. "I don't know 
but you ought to know, but how can I tell you ! 

I don't know how I can tell you ! " 

Dolly trembled in her doubt and distress; she 
fought down tears. Both hands went up to cover 
her face. 

" Is it a trouble in which I can help ? " 

" I don't know ! " 

"If I am to help, you must tell me something 
more, Dolly." 

" Yes, but I cannot. if you knew, you would 
know that I cannot. I think perhaps you ought 
to know, but I cannot tell you ! I don't see how 

I can tell you ! " 

"Then do not try to tell me, until we are 
married," said he soothingly. "It will be easier 
then." 

" But I think you ought to know before," said 
Dolly, and he felt how she trembled in his arms. 



 

" If you don't know, you will not be able to understand " 

" What ? " for Dolly paused. 

" What I do. You will not understand it." 

"What are you going to do ? " said Mr. Shubrick 
smiling ; she knew he was smiling. " You are going home to be ready to meet me; and the day 
I come, we are going to be married. Then you 
can tell me what you like. Hey ? " 

" But you don't know ! " cried Dolly. " I can't 
tell when we shall go home. I don't know whether 
father will quit England for all I can say. I don't 
know whether he will ever quit it ! " 

"Then, as I remarked before, I will have the 
honour to come to England and fetch you." 

"Ah but I could not go then." 

"Why not?" 

"I could not leave them alone here." 

" Why not here as well as in America ? " 

"My father needs me here " said Dolly in a 
low voice, and with tears, what sharp tears of bitterness ! coming into her eyes. 

" Needs you ! Do not I need you ? " said Mr. 
Shubrick. 

" No," said Dolly. " I am so glad you don't ! " 
And her brown eyes gave one flash of undoubted, 
albeit inexplicable, pride and rejoicing into his 
face. 

" How do you dare say that, Dolly ? " he asked 
in growing curiosity and mystification. 

"You can stand alone," she said, her voice again 



 

drooping. Mr. Shubrick was silent a moment, considering what this might mean. They had not altered their relative positions during this little dialogue. Dolly's face was again covered by her 
hands. 

" I don't know if I can stand alone," said San- 
die at last slowly; "but I am not going to try." 

" Perhaps you must," said Dolly sadly, lifting 
her face again. "If I can get father to go home, 
I will ; maybe you can do it if I cannot. But I am 
not sure that anybody can do it. Mr. Shubrick, 
he did not use to be like this; he was everything 
different ; he was what you would have liked ; but 
now he has got in with some people here in whose 
company he how can I tell you ! " cried Dolly, 
bursting into tears ; but then she fought them back 
and struggled for voice and went on with sad 
bravery. " I have told you so much, I must tell 
you the whole. He is not just master of himself; 
temptation takes liold of him and he cannot resist 
it. They lead him to play and betting and he 
loses money, and then comes wine." Dolly's 
voice fell. " I have been trying and trying to get 
him back; sometimes I almost thought I had done 
it; but the temptation gets hold of him again, and 
then everything goes. And so, I cannot be sure," 
Dolly went on, as Mr. Shubrick remained silent, 
"what he will do about going home. Once he 
would have done it for me; but I do not know 
what he will do now. I cannot tell. And if there 
is a hope for him, it is in me. I have not been 



 

able to do much, yet; but if I cannot, no one can. 
Unless you, perhaps; but you cannot be with him. 
And you see, Mr. Shubrick, that even if I can be 
of no use to him, I could not leave mother all 
alone. I could not. I am glad you know it all 
now; but "
