"See here, steward, can't we arrange this thing," replied Dock, turning
to his remorseless captor.

"Ring the bell! We'll arrange it in the court."

Dock rang the bell. Little did the father and mother of Bessie sleep
while she was away from them, and they heard the bell the first time it
was rung.

"Who's there?" called Mr. Watson from a second-story window.

"Augustus, sir," replied the steward, in the mildest of tones. "There's
a gentleman here to see you, sir."

"I will be down in a moment;" and presently a light appeared in the
dining-room.

"Walk in," said Mr. Watson, opening the door.

"Walk in!" repeated Augustus, in stern tones.

Dock followed the merchant into the dining-room, closely attended by
his guard.

"Vincent!" exclaimed Mr. Watson, when he turned to see who his midnight
visitor was.

"Yes, sir," replied the steward. "You will pardon me for bringing him
here, sir; but I did not know what else to do with him."

"Vincent, where is my daughter?" demanded the merchant, earnestly.

"She is on her way to Australia," replied Dock, who was now beginning
to recover his self-possession, and to measure the consequences of his
misfortune.

"I beg to suggest, Mr. Watson, that his reply is a wretched falsehood,"
interposed the steward. "I heard him tell Mr. Fairfield that his vessel
wasn't a great ways from New York."

"In the latitude of New York, I meant merely. Mr. Watson, this man is
making a mess of it for you. I made my demand of you by letter. Give me
the money, and your daughter shall be restored. If you don't, you will
never see her again, whatever may happen to me," said Dock.

"Not a dollar! Not a penny!" replied Mr. Watson, with emphasis.

"Very well, Mr. Watson. You will discover your mistake soon enough,"
added Dock.

"We want an officer and a pair of handcuffs," said Mr. Watson. "Can you
keep him while I procure assistance?"

"I can," answered Augustus, confidently, as he displayed his pistol.

Mr. Watson called his two men, and sent one of them for Constable
Cooke, who was the only officer available at that hour of the night. He
came, and the villain was ironed. The constable and the steward kept
guard over him till morning.




CHAPTER XXIII.

OFF SANDY HOOK.


Levi did not learn that the great enemy had been captured till he went
up in the morning to relieve the steward; but the news was spreading
rapidly, and it came to his ear before he reached his station. He
hastened to the house of Mr. Watson, where Constable Cooke and the
steward still kept vigil over the fallen foe. The officer evidently did
not relish his employment; but Mr. C. Augustus Eb√©nier had proved that
he was a first-class tiger, as well as an exquisite of the first water.

Mr. Watson had another interview with the wretch as soon as Levi
arrived; but Dock Vincent was as obstinate as a mule. He took no pains
to conceal the fact that he enjoyed the distress of the suffering
father and the intense anxiety of Levi. The prisoner was to be examined
before Squire Saunders during the forenoon, and it was hoped that some
development of the plan of the conspirator would be obtained.

By the morning train came Mr. Gayles. The steamer sent in pursuit of
the Caribbee had returned to Boston in the night. Of course she had not
seen or heard of the vessel, which had gone through Vineyard Sound,
while the steamer followed the track of ships bound round the Cape of
Good Hope.

"Has he been searched?" asked Mr. Gayles, when he had reported the
result of his mission to his employer.

"No; I proposed it to Mr. Cooke, but he declined to do it until a
warrant had been obtained," replied Mr. Watson.

"It should be done at once;" and Mr. Gayles hastened to attend to this
important duty.

Dock blustered, and attempted to resist the indignity, as he termed it;
but the constable was determined, and heeded not the prisoner's protest
or his struggles. On his person was found a variety of papers, and
among them the letter which Captain Gauley had written in the cabin of
the Caribbee. But this document had no signature, and was hardly more
satisfactory than the letter which Mr. Watson had received from Bessie;
at least it contained no accurate information. One sentence, however,
was sufficiently definite to make a beginning upon. "We are somewhere
inside of Sandy Hook, ready to go to sea at a moment's notice," Captain
Gauley wrote. "You know where to leave a letter in New York, when you
are ready to go on board; and one of us goes up to the city every day
now."

"It's no use," said Dock, maliciously. "You can't find the Caribbee.
Mr. Watson, I may rot in jail; but you will never see your daughter
again if you go on with this matter. If you want to get her back, pay
me the money I ask, let me go, and you shall have her in a week."

"I will not pay you a dollar," replied Mr. Watson, firmly.

"All right," added Dock, with a sneer. "You will wish you had in the
course of a year or two. I know what I'm about this time."

Mr. Watson, Mr. Gayles, and Levi went to another room to consider the
situation, leaving Constable Cooke in charge of the prisoner.

"Cooke, do you want to make a hundred dollars easy?" said Dock, in a
whisper.

"I don't know," replied the officer. "I can't compromise myself."

"You run no risk," added Dock, as he wrote with a pencil, on half a
sheet of note paper, the letter which Captain Gauley received just
before the Caribbee sailed. "Put this in an envelope, direct it to
Captain John Gauley, care of E. G. Baines & Co., No. ---- Maiden Lane,
New York, and put it into the post office. That's all; and here is a
hundred dollars."

Constable Cooke took the note and the money. Dock wrote the direction
for the letter on a piece of paper. He thrust the whole into his
pocket. He had his doubts, as well he might, about the propriety of
mailing the letter.

Levi, from the information obtained, was satisfied that the Caribbee
was at anchor in one of the secluded inlets below New York, waiting for
Dock to join her. It was not likely that she would go to sea without
her owner, whose family were on board of her.

"Dock says she will go to Australia, whether he joins her or not," said
Mr. Gayles.

"She will not sail till those on board have heard from Dock. We must
take care that he does not send any letter or message," added Levi.

"Perhaps it would be better to let him do so, if we could only stop the
letter at the post office."

"But we don't know who has charge of the vessel. It is plain that he
has a captain on board of her; but he does not sign his name to the
letter we found upon Dock," interposed Mr. Watson.
