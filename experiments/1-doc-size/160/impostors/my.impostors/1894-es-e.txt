" What ! " 

" Primo, as you say, how should he ? I 
didn't know it myself until you told me. 
He has been in this country but seven days, 
and five he has passed at the Logerot. The 
letter he got for Aunt Adelaide was given 
before father died. Since then he has been 
in Brazil. Why, Brazil is as far as another 
planet. There was no one there to tell him, 
and since he has been here he has met no 
one who could. Is that enough for primo ? 
It is, is it ? Now for secundo. He has told 
me everything about himself, everything ; 
about Eton, about Oxford, about his regiment, and about his people. He told me 
that his grandfather had been very extravagant, his father also ; that it had been arranged he was to marry his second cousin, 
Lady Maud Manners; that he might 'have 
done so had he cared for her, but that she 
was an heiress, and that, to quote his own 





expression, stuck in his throat. Then he 
told me that he was a democrat, that he had 
determined to make money for himself, that 
his botanizing tour was but a refuge in case 
of failure, that in Brazil he had gone into 
coffee, that he had succeeded with it, and 
that now, instead of his second cousin the 
heiress, he proposed, should he marry at all, 
to marry a girl of his choice. Is that enough 
for secundo ? It is, is it ? Very good ; when 
he told me all that yesterday afternoon, he 
knew no more about my wampum than I 
know about yours. So there ! " 

Bancroft nodded with an air of relief. 
Apparently the premises and conclusion sat- 
isfied him amply. But he had not made a 
study of direct, cross, and redirect examina- 
tion for nothing. He looked at the rug, 
then at the window, finally at the girl, and 
in another tone and rather sadly he asked : 

" Do you really love him ? " 

The girl, her eyes lowered, walked straight 
into the trap. 

" I don't know ; I thought I did last night. 





But I have been mistaken before. Besides, 
does a girl ever know ? " 

"Where a title is concerned she usually 
does. Girls like them, and with reason. A 
title can be divided, a duke makes a duch- 
ess ; whereas a man of brains cannot share 
his intellect with a fool." 

Myrrha looked up ; the twin roses re- 
turned. "Arthur, that is unfair of you. I 
may be a fool, but I am not a snob. You 
know I care nothing for his title." 

"Ah ! Supposing it should appear that he 
has none, would you marry him then, provid- 
ing, I mean, you intend to marry him at 
all ? " 

" And how could such a thing appear ? " 
Myrrha with an assumption of great haughti- 
ness and defiance inquired. 

" From his own account, that botanizing 
tour was a sham ; might not the title be one 
as well ? " 

On the girl's face the roses deepened ; but 
when she spoke, as she instantly did, their 
warmth was not in her tone. 





" Do you mean that you think him an 
impostor ? " 

" I mean that I have seen him before, 
and not at the siege of Troy, either." 

So measured were the words, and so sig- 
nificant too, that autumn must have touched 
the roses they disappeared. 

" So have you," he added. " Now tell 
me where." 

The girl was trembling, her face ashen. 

" Tell me," he insisted ; and projecting 
his teeth, contracting his features, his face 
took on the horror of a Chinese mask. 

" I don't know, I don't know," she cried. 
" You drive me mad. O Arthur, don't " 

The features relaxed. 

" Myrrha, will you promise me that this 
engagement shall remain in abeyance until 
I can learn something about him ? Will 
you ? Will you promise me that ? " 

"Yes," she gasped, "anything." 

Bancroft stood up, crossed the room, unlocked the door and touched a bell. In a 
moment the butler appeared. 





" Harris " 

"Yes, sir." 

" Harris, have you ever seen Lord Cloden 
before this week ? " 

The man stared. 

"Answer me, can't you?" 

" No, sir, I never have. Leastway, not 
that I remember." 

" Have you ever seen any one who at 
all resembled him ? " 

" That I have, sir." 

"Well, where?" 

"At Ascot 'Eath, sir, when I see'd his 
honored pa. I remember it like it was 
yesterday, his lordship stood that near " 

"There, Harris, that will do." 

"Yes, sir; thank you, sir." 

Bancroft turned to the girl again. The
