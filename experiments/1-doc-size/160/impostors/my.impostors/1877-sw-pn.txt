" But I mean, isn't it right for us to do what we 
like with it?" 

" I should like to do that," murmured Meredith. 

"Miss Flora, the question is, rightly stated, May 
a steward use his lord's money for his own or his 
lord's pleasure ? " 

Flora coloured, and pouted. "But that makes 
religion Why, I never thought religion was strict 
like that. Then it isn't right to buy jewels, or 
dresses." 

" Dresses certainly." 



 

"But I mean, rich dresses; dresses for company. 
And pictures and horses and books and " 

"Stop, Miss Flora. The servant himself belongs 
to his lord; therefore he must make of himself the 
very best he can. For this, books will certainly be
needed and to some degree all the other things 
you have named, except jewels and what you call 
rich dresses. The only question in each case is 
' How can I do the Lord's work best ? how can I 
spend this money to honour and please him most?' 
That will not always be by the cheapest dress that 
can be bought ; nor by checking the cultivation of 
taste and the acquiring of knowledge, nor even 
by the foregoing of arts and accomplishments. 
Only the question comes back at every step, and 
must at every step be answered ' What does the 
Lord want me to do here? Does he wish me to 
spend this money or time on myself, or on some 
body else ? ' " 

"Why it would be always on somebody else," 
said Flora, looking ready to burst into tears ; " and 
there would be no real living at all ! no enjoying 
of life." 

"A mistake" said Mr. Murray quietly. "The 
Lord told us long ago ' He that will save his life 
shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake, 
the same shall find it.' " 

Flora put up her hand over her eyes, but Mere 
dith's eyes sparkled. 

" Then you think well of my plan, Mr. Murray ? " 
he said. 



 

" As far as I understand it." 

" How would the Pavilion do, for a skeleton of 
the church?" 

" Ditto ! the dear old Pavilion ! " exclaimed 
Maggie. 

"Why not? I do not want to shut myself off 
from everybody now and I have the whole house ; 
more than enough. And the Pavilion stands in a 
good place, near the road." 

Mr. Murray and Meredith went into a discussion 
of the plan, and Maggie listened, while Flora after 
a while resumed her work and went moodily on 
with it. At last Mr. Murray remarked, 

"This is not so interesting to everybody, Meredith, and we have time enough to talk it over. 
Suppose you go on reading." 

"Do you like these Saxon stories?" said Meredith, pleased. 

"Very much." 

"There is some more here about not Dageforde 
exactly, but that same fight, which I think you 
would like perhaps to hear." 

"And Meredith, you did not read us about that 
minister who was converted by the catechism," 
said Maggie. 

"No, that is another story Pastor Griinhagen. 
I will read to you first about the fight at the 
Hunenburg. 

"'The Hunenburg is situated in a deep dell in 
the midst of the heath about an hour from Hermannsburg; and I will relate to you what I have 



 

found in the chronicle about it. It is nine hundred 
years now since a hard-fought and terrible battle 
took place here, which was fought between the 
Christians and the heathen. At that time the pious and Christian kaiser, Otto the Great, ruled in 
Germany (A. D. 936-973), who loved the Lord his 
God with all his heart. He had gone away out of 
Germany into Italy, in order to free a captive queen 
who was kept in prison there by some godless folk. 
But he would not leave Germany without protection ; therefore he made over this country to Duke 
Hermann, to govern it and to take care of it. In 
like manner Adaldag, archbishop of Hamburg and 
Bremen, who went with the kaiser, confided his 
dominions to the same guardianship. Now the 
Wends, who lived on the other side of the Elbe, 
especially in Mechlenburg, and had spread them 
selves abroad on this side the Elbe also, were at 
that time still heathen. And now when the kaiser 
was absent, they thought the time was come for 
marauding and plundering, hunting the Christians 
out of their country, or utterly destroying them. 
So they summoned up all their warriors, and that 
so secretly that the Christians knew nothing of it 
until they came breaking into the country. As 
there was nowhere any preparation for defence 
against them, they robbed and plundered all that 
came in their way, burned down the churches, 
killed the priests, and dragged the rest into captivity for slaves. Duke Hermann was just then in 
the Bremen territory, from whence he had expelled 



 

the piratical Northmen (the Danes). There the 
terrible news found him. In the greatest haste he 
collected his warriors to come and save his coun 
try. For the Wends had already penetrated to 
Luneburg, as far as this heath, and had laid every 
thing waste with fire and sword; the Hermannsburg church was destroyed by them at that time. 
Here upon this ground they had made a strong encampment, and surrounded it with ditches and fortifications like a fortress ; they were from fifty to six 
ty thousand men strong, in horsemen and footmen, 
and all of them alive with the same enraged hatred 
of the Christians, and determined that every trace 
of Christianity should be wiped away from the land. In August of the year 945 Duke Hermann 
marched hither out of the Bremen country, over 
the northern heights of Liddernhausen and Dohnsen. When he saw himself with his eight thou 
sand men on foot and two thousand horsemen confronted by the great host of the Wends, he said to 
his faithful followers "We must fight; whether 
God will give us the victory, we must leave with 
him." Then stepped up one of his knights before 
him, who is called in the chronicle "the brave 
Conrad," of the now extinct race of them of Haselhorst, and spoke: 

"Let us get a token from God. I will go forward and challenge one of the enemy to single
