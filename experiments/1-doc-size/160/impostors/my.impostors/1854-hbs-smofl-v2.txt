Ever and anon H. was amused at the pathetic air, at once 
genuinely French and thoroughly sincere, with which the 
master assured her, that he was " desole " to put her to so 
much trouble. 

As to Christianity not making men happier, methinks M. 
Belloc forgets that the old Greek tragedies are filled with 
despair and gloom, as then' prevailing characteristic, and that 
nearly all the music of the world before Christ was in the 
minor scale, as since Christ it has come to be in the major. The 
whole creation has, indeed, groaned and travailed in pain together until now ; but the mighty anthem has modulated since 
the cross, and the requiem of Jesus has been the world's 
birthsong of approaching jubilee. 

Music is a far better test, moreover, on such a point, than 
painting, for just where painting is weakest, namely, in the 



 

expression of the highest moral and spiritual ideas, there 
music is most sublimely strong. 

Altogether this morning in the painter's studio was one of 
the most agreeable we ever spent. But what shall I say then 
of the evening in a salon musicale ; with the first violoncello 
playing in the world, and the Princess Czartoryski at the 
piano ? We were invited at eight, but it was nine before we 
entered our carriage. TVe arrived at the hotel of Mrs. Ers- 
kine, a sister of Lord Dundalk, and found a very select party. 
There were chairs and sofas enough for all without crowding. 

There was Frankomm of the Conservatoire, with his Stradivarius, an instrument one hundred and fifty years old, which 
cost six thousand dollars. There was his son, a little lad of 
twelve, who played almost as well as his father. I wish F. 
and M. could have seen this. He was but a year older than 
F., and yet played with the most astonishing perfection. 
Among other things the little fellow performed a morceau of 
his own composition, which was full of pathos, and gave tokens 
of uncommon ability. His father gave us sonatas of Mozart, 
Chopin, &c, and a polonaise. The Princess Czartoryski accompanied on the piano with extraordinary ability. 

That was an evening to be remembered a lifetime. One 
heard, probably, the best music in the world of its kind, 
performed under prepared circumstances, the most perfectly 
adapted to give effect. There was no whispering, no noise. 
All felt, and heard, and enjoyed. I conversed with the prin- 
cess and with Frankomm. The former speaks English, the 
latter none. I interpreted for II., and she had quite a little 
conversation with him about his son, and about music. She 
told him she hoped the day was coming when art would be 
consecrated to express the best and purest emotions of humanity. He had read Uncle Tom ; and when he read it he 
exclaimed, " This is genuine Christianity " — " Ceci est la 
vraie Christiamsme ! * 

The attentions shown to H. were very touching and agreeable. 
There is nothing said or done that wearies or oppresses her. 
She is made to feel perfectly free, at lar«ge, at ease ; and the 
regard felt for her is manifested in a way so delicate, so imperceptibly fine and considerate, that she is rather strengthened 
by it than exhausted. This is owing, no doubt, to the fact 
that we came determined to be as private as possible, and 
with an explicit understanding with Mrs. C. to that effect. 
Instead of trying to defeat her purpose, and force her into 
publicity, the few who know of her presence seem to try to 
help her carry it out, and see how much they can do for her, 
consistently therewith. 

Tuesday, June 14. To-day we dined at six P. M., and read 
till nine. Then drove to an evening salon — quite an early 
little party at Mrs. Putnam's. Saw there Peter Parley and 
La Rochejaquelin, the only one of the old nobility that joined 
Louis Napoleon. Peter Parley is consul no longer, it seems. 
We discussed the empire a very little. " To be, or not to be, 
that is the question." Opinions are various as the circles. 
Every circle draws into itself items of information, that tend 
to indicate what it wishes to be about to happen. Still, Peter 
Parley and I, and some other equally cautious people, think 
that this cannot always last. By this, of course, we mean 
this " thing " — this empire, so called. Sooner or later it 
must end in revolution ; and then what ? Said a gentleman the 
other day, " Nothing holds him up but fear of the Red."  
That is, fear of the Red Republicans. 







After chatting a while, Weston and I slipped out, and drove 
to the Jardin Mabille, a garden in the Champs Elysees, whither thousands go every night. We entered by an avenue of 
poplars and other trees and shrubs, so illuminated by jets of 
gas sprinkled amongst the foliage as to give it the effect of 
enchantment. It was neither moonlight nor daylight, but a 
kind of spectral aurora, that made every thing seem unearthly. 

As we entered the garden, we found flower beds laid out 
in circles, squares, lozenges, and every conceivable form, with 
diminutive jets of gas so distributed as to imitate flowers of 
the softest tints, and the most perfect shape. This, too, 
seemed unearthly, weird. We seemed, in an instant, transported into some Thalaba's cave, infinitely beyond the common 
sights and sounds of every-day life. In the centre of these 
grounds there is a circle of pillars, on the top of each of which 
is a pot of flowers, with gas jets, and between them an arch 
of gas jets. This circle is very large. In the midst of it is 
another circle, forming a pavilion for musicians, also brilliantly illuminated, and containing a large cotillon band of 
the most finished performers. 

Around this you find thousands of gentlemen and ladies 
strolling singly, in pairs, or in groups. There could not be 
less than three thousand persons present. While the musicians repose, they loiter, sauntering round, or recline on seats. 

But now a lively waltz strikes the ear. In an instant 
twenty or thirty couples are whirling along, floating, like 
thistles in the wind, around the central pavilion. Their feet 
scarce touch the smooth-trodden earth. Round and round, in 
a vortex of life, beauty, and brilliancy they go, a whirlwind of 
delight. Eyes sparkling, cheeks flushing, and gauzy draperies 
floating by ; while the crowds outside gather in a ring, and 







watch the giddy revel. There are countless forms of symmetry and grace, faces of wondrous beauty, both among the 
dancers and among the spectators. 

There, too, are feats of agility and elasticity quite aerial. 
One lithe and active dancer grasped Ins fair partner by the 
waist. She was dressed in a red dress ; was small, elastic, 
agile, and went by like the wind. And now and then, in 
the course of every few seconds, he would give her a whirl 
and a lift, sending her spinning through the air, around him- 
self as an axis, full four feet from the ground. 

Then the music ceases, the crowd dissolves, and floats and 
saunters away. On every hand are games of hazard and 
skill, with balls, tops, wheels, &c, where, for five cents a trial, 
one might seek to gain a choice out of glittering articles exposed to view. 

Then the band strike up again, and the whirling dance 
renews its vortex ; and so it goes on, from hour to hour, till 
two or three in the morning. Not that we staid till then ; 
we saw all we wanted to see, and left by eleven. But it is 
a scene perfectly unearthly, or rather perfectly Parisian, and 
just as earthly as possible ; yet a scene where earthliness is 
worked up into a style of sublimation the most exquisite 
conceivable. 

Entrance to this paradise can be had for, gentlemen, a dollar ; ladies, free. This tells the whole story. Nevertheless, 
do not infer that there are not any respectable ladies there. 
It is a place so remarkable, that very few strangers stay long 
in Paris without taking a look at it. And though young 
ladies residing in Paris never go, and matrons very seldom, 
yet occasionally it is the case that some ladies of respectability look in. The best dancers, those who exhibit such
