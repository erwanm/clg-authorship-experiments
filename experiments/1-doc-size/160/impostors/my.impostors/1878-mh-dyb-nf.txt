and peas. Boil slowly half an hour. Pulp through a colander; stir in a
tablespoonful of corn-starch wet with cold water, and a tablespoonful
of white sugar. Simmer five minutes, and pour out.


SALMI OF DUCKS.

Cut the meat neatly from the bones, having the slices as nearly as
possible of uniform size. Make a gravy of the bones, stuffing, skin,
etc., and a quart of water, boiling gently down to one large cupful.
Skim and strain this into a saucepan. Add the juice of a lemon, and
browned flour for thickening; stir smooth, and lay in the sliced duck.
Warm slowly at one side of the range, but do not let it boil. When very
hot, pour upon oblong slices of fried toast covering the bottom of a
hot dish.


MASHED SQUASH.

Peel, quarter, and boil soft. Mash in a hot colander, pressing hard.
Serve in a deep dish, with butter, pepper, and salt beaten in.


STRING-BEANS.

Cut off the strings from both sides; cut into short lengths, and cook
tender in boiling salt water. They require twice as much time as
peas. Drain, season with pepper, salt, and butter. Set aside half for
to-morrow’s salad.


CUCUMBERS.

Peel and lay in ice-water one hour. Slice; put upon a lump of ice in a
salad-dish, and season to taste upon saucers after they are helped out.


ALMOND CORN-STARCH BLANC-MANGE.

1 quart of milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch; 3 eggs; ¼ lb.
almonds, blanched, dried, and pounded; rose-water and bitter almond; ¾
cup of powdered sugar.

Scald the milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in. Have the almonds
beaten to a paste with a teaspoonful of rose-water, and stir into
the hot milk. Simmer five minutes; then strain through thin muslin,
pressing hard upon the almonds. Add this, hot, to the beaten eggs and
sugar; put upon the fire, and stir in, with the eggs, the corn-starch
wet up in cold milk, never taking the spoon out until it is thick. Take
off; flavor, and pour into a wet mould. Set in ice, and it will soon
form. Eat with sugar and cream.

RICE SOUP.

Take the fat from your cold stock, and strain it from the meat. Boil up
once and skim. Add half a cup of rice, and simmer until this is very
tender. Add the water in which have been soaked two tablespoonfuls of
burnt sugar, and pour out.


STUFFED VEAL WITH GARNISH OF GREEN PEAS.

Take the large bones from a piece of loin of veal; stuff the cavities
thus made with a good force-meat of chopped pork crumbs and seasoning—a
few chopped mushrooms are an improvement—cover the sides with greased
sheets of thick writing-paper; put a cupful of soup stock or other
gravy in the dripping-pan, and baste well, for one hour with butter
and water, afterwards with the gravy. Cook fully twelve minutes to
the pound. Take off the paper during the last half hour; dredge with
flour, baste with butter, and brown nicely. Take up and keep hot while
you skim the fat from the gravy, stir into it half a cupful of chopped
mushrooms and a little browned flour. Serve this—having cooked it three
minutes—in a boat. Have ready some green peas, boiled and seasoned, and
make a fence of them about the veal when dished.


NEW POTATOES.

Refer to Thursday, Second Week in July.


BOILED CORN.

See Thursday, Fourth Week in June.


BEAN SALAD.

Cut the beans into inch-lengths, pile in a salad-dish and pour upon
them such a dressing as you compounded for the raw tomatoes on Friday
of Second Week in July. Garnish with curled lettuce.


ORANGE SNOW.

4 large sweet oranges, all the juice, and the grated peel of one; juice
and half the grated peel of 1 lemon; 1 package of Coxe’s gelatine
soaked in a cup of cold water; whites of 4 eggs, whipped stiff; 1 large
cup of white sugar; 3 cups of boiling water.

Mix the juice, and peel of the fruit with the soaked gelatine, also the
sugar. Leave them covered for one hour, then pour on the boiling water
and stir clear. Strain through flannel, wringing hard. When quite cold,
whip in the frothed whites very gradually until the mixture is a white
sponge. Put into a wet mould on Saturday, and set on the ice.


ICED TEA AND CAKE.

Set the tea aside after breakfast in a pitcher, or bottle, which you
can keep in ice. When you serve it, half fill each glass with ice, put
in more sugar than you would use for hot tea, and pour on the cold
liquid.

SUMMER SQUASH, OR CYMBLING SOUP.

The bones from your cold veal; 2 lbs. lean, raw veal, chopped fine;
1 onion; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed in flour; 1 cup of milk,
with a pinch of soda; 1 tablespoonful of white sugar; 2 beaten eggs;
2 good-sized white squash pared and quartered; pepper and salt; fried
bread; 4 quarts of water.

Boil bones, meat, and onions in four quarts of water until this is
reduced to two. Strain, cool, and take off the fat. Cook the squash
in one pint of the stock until soft enough to rub through a colander;
pulp, and put this, with its liquor, in the remaining three pints of
broth; also the sugar, seasoning, and floured butter, and cook slowly
without boiling, five minutes. Heat the milk, pour upon the eggs, stir
over the fire until it begins to thicken. Put dice of fried bread into
the tureen; pour on the milk and eggs, then the soup, and stir up well.


SCALLOPED VEAL.
