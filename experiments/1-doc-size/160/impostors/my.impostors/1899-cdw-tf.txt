when he applied to his publishers and told them 
of his decision, they gave him some work as a 
reader for the house. At first this was fitful and 
intermittent, but as he showed both literary dis^ 
crimination and tact in judging of tlie market, 
his services were more in request, and slowly he 
acquired confidential relations with the house. 
Whatever he knew, his knowledge pf languages 
and his experience^ abroad, canje into play, and 
he began to have*more confidence in himself, as 
he saw'that his somewhat desultory education 
had, after all, a market value. 

The rather long period of his struggle, which 
is a common struggle, and often disheartening, 
need not be dwelt on here. We can anticipate 





 

by saying that he obtained in the house a per- 
manent and responsible situation, with an in- 
come sufficient for a bachelor without habits of 
self-indulgence. It was not the crowning of a 
noble ambition, it was not in the least the 
career he had dreamed of, but it gave him sup- 
port and a recognized position, and, above all, 
did not divert, him from such creative work 
as he was competent to do. Nay, he found very 
soon that the feeling of security, without any 
sordid worry, gave freedom to his imagination. 
There was something stimulating in the atmos- 
phere of books and manuscripts and in that 
world of letters which seems so large to those 
who live in it. Fortunately, also, having a sup- 
port, he was not tempted to debase his talent by 
sensational ventures. What he wrote for this or 
that magazine he wrote to please himself, and, 
although he saw no fortune that way, the little 
he received was an encouragement as well as an 
appreciable addition to his income. 

There are two sorts of success in letters as in 
life generally. The one is achieved suddenly, by 
a dash, and it lasts as long as the author can 
keep the attention of the spectators upon his 
scintillating novelties. When the sparks fade 
there is darkness. How many such glittering 
spectacles this century has witnessed ! There is 
another sort of success which does not startlingly 




 

or at once declare itself. Sometimes it comes 
with little observation. The reputation is slowly- 
built up, as by a patient process of nature. It is 
curious, as Philip wrote once in an essay, to see 
this unfolding in Lowell's life. There was no 
one moment when he launched into great popu- 
larity — nay, in detail, he seemed to himself not 
to have made the strike that ambition is always 
expecting. But lo ! the time came when, by uni- 
versal public consent, which was in the nature of 
a surprise to him, he had a high and permanent 
place in the world of letters. 

In anticipating Philip's career, however, it 
must not be understood that he had attained any 
wide public recognition. He was simply en- 
rolled in the great army of readers and was 
serving his apprenticeship. He was recognized 
as a capable man by those who purvey in letters 
to the entertainment of the world. Even this 
little foothold was not easily gained in a day, as 
the historian discovered in reading some bundles 
of old letters which Philip wrote in this time of 
his novitiate to Celia and to his cousin Alice. 

It was against Celia's most strenuous advice 
that he had trusted himself to a literary career. 
" I see, my dear friend," she wrote, in reply to 
his announcement that he was going that day to 
Mr. Hunt to resign his position, " that you are 
not happy, but whatever your disappointment or 
disillusion, you will not better yourself by sur- 
rendering a regular occupation. You live too 
much in the imagination already." 

Philip fancied, with that fatuity common to 
his sex, that he had worn an impenetrable mask 
in regard to his wild passion for Evelyn, and did 
not dream that, all along, Celia had read him like 
an open book. She judged Philip quite accu- 
rately. It was herself that she did not know, 
and she would have repelled as nonsense the sug- 
gestion that her own restlessness and her own 
changing experiments in occupation were due to 
the unsatisfied longings of a woman's heart. 

"You must not think," the letter went on, 
" that I want to dictate, but I have noticed that 
men — it may be different with women- — only 
succeed by taking one path and diligently walk- 
ing in it. And literature is not a career, it is 
just a toss up, a lottery, and woe to you if you 
once draw a lucky number — ^you will always be ex- 
pecting another. . . . You say that I am a pretty 
one to give advice, for I am always chopping 
and changing myself. "Well, from the time you 
were a little boy, did I ever give you but one 
sort of advice? I have been constant in that. 
And as to myself, you are unjust. I have always 
had one distinct object in life, and that I have 
pursued. I wanted to find out about life, to have 
experience, and then do what I could do best, 




 

and what needed most to be done. Why did I 
not stick to teaching in that woman's college? 
"Well, I began to have doubts, I began to experi- 
ment on my pupils. You will laugh, but I will 
give you a specimen. One day I put a question 
to my literature class, and I found out that not 
one of them knew how to boil potatoes. They 
were all getting an education, and hardly one of 
them knew how much the happiness of a home 
depends upon having the potatoes mealy and 
not soggy. It was so in everything. How are 
we going to live when we are all educated, with- 
out knowing how to live ? Then I found that 
the masses here in New York did not know any 
better than the classes how to live. Don't think 
it is just a matter of cooking. It is knowing 
how, generally, to make the most of yourself and 
of your opportunities, and have a nice world to 
live in, a thrifty, self-helpful, disciplined world. 
Is education giving us this ? And then we think 
that organization will do it, organization instead 
of self-development. "We think we can organize 
life, as they are trying to organize art. They 
have organized art as they have the production 
of cotton. 

" Did I tell you I was in that ? No ? I used 

to draw in school, and after I had worked in the 

Settlement here in New York, and while I was 

working down on the East Side, it came over
