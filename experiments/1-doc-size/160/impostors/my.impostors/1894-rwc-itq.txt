called the hunting excursion planned with such 
enthusiasm weeks before. After that first day 
in the trout stream, Ruth not only suffered more 
from fatigue than she had expected, but the 
little cough came back, causing her parents 
to draw the lines of discipline very tight in 
deed. 

Ruth, whose character seemed made of equal 
parts of good taste and reasonableness, sweet 
temper and humor, did not offer the least opposition to discipline, and when her mother remarked that after all there was a difference be 
tween a school-girl and a young lady, she did not 
deny it. The colonel and Rex went off once or 
twice with the Jaegers, but in a half-hearted 
way, bringing back more experience than game. 
Then Rex went on a sketching tour. Then the 
colonel was suddenly called again to Munich to 
meet some old army men just arrived from 
home, and so it was not until about a week 
after Mr. Blumenthal's departure that one even 
ing, when the Sennerins were calling the cows 
on the upper Aim, a party of climbers came up 





the side of the Red Peak, and stopped at "Nani's 
Hutterl." 

Sepp threw down the green sack from his 
shoulders to the bench before the door, and 
shouted: 

"Nani! du! Nani!" No answer. 

"Marie und Josef!" he muttered; then raising 
his voice, again he called for Nani with all his 
lungs. 

A muffled answer came from somewhere 
around the other side of the house. "Ja! komm 
glei!" And then there was nothing to do but 
sit on the bench and watch the sunset fade from 
peak to peak while they waited. 

Nani did not come "glei" but she came pretty 
soon, bringing with her two brimming milk-pails 
as an excuse for the delay. 

She and Sepp engaged at once in a conver 
sation, to which the colonel listened with feel 
ings that finally had to seek expression. 

"I believe," he said in a low voice, "that 
German is the language of the devil." 

"I fancy he's master of more than one. And 
besides, this isn't German, any more than our 
mountain dialects are English. And really," 



 

Ruth went on, "if it comes to comparing dia 
lects, it seems to me ours can't stand the test. 
These are harsh enough. But where in the 
world is human speech so ugly, so poverty- 
stricken, so barren of meaning and feeling, and 
shade, and color, and suggestiveness as the 
awful talk of our rustics? A Bavarian, a Tyro- 
ler, often speaks a whole poem in a single word, 
like" 

"Do you think one of those poems is being 
spoken about our supper now, Daisy?" 

"Sybarite!" cried Ruth, with that tinkle of 
fun in her voice, which was always sounding 
between her and her parents; "I won't tell you." 
The truth was she did not dare to tell her 
hungry companions that, so far as she had been 
able to understand Sepp and Nani, their con 
versation had turned entirely on a platform 
dance, which they called a "Schuh-plattl" and 
which they proposed to attend together on the 
following Sunday. 

But, Sepp having had his gossip, like a true 
South German hunter man, finally did ask the 
important question: 

"Ach! supper! du lieber Himmel! there was 





little enough of that for the Herrschaften. There 
was black bread and milk, and there were some 
Semmel, but those were very old and hard." 

"No cheese?" 

"Nein!" 

"No butter?" 

"Nein!" 

"Coffee?" 

"Yes, but no sugar." 

"Herr Je !" 

When Sepp delivered this news to his party 
they all laughed and said black bread and milk 
would do. So Nani invited them into her only 
room, the rest of the "Hiitterl" was kitchen 
and cow-shed, and brought the feast. 

A second Sennerin came with her this time, 
in a costume which might have startled them, 
if they had not already seen others like it. It 
consisted of a pair of high blue cotton trousers 
drawn over her skirts, the latter bulging all round 
inside the jeans. She had no teeth, and there 
was a large goiter on her neck. 

"Good Heavens!" muttered the colonel, set 
ting down his bowl of milk and twisting around 
to stare out of the window behind him. 



 

"Poor thing! she can't help it!" murmured 
Ruth. 

"No more she can, you dear, good girl!" said 
Rex, and his eyes shone very kindly, Ruth 
caught her breath at the sudden beating of her 
heart. 

What was left of day-light came through the 
little window and fell upon her face; it was as 
white as a flower, and very quiet. 

Dusk was setting in when Sepp made his ap 
pearance. He stood about in some hesitation, 
and finally addressed himself to Ruth, as the 
one who could best understand his dialect. She 
listened and then turned to her father. 

"Sepp doesn't exactly know where to lodge me. 
He had thought I could stay here with Nani
