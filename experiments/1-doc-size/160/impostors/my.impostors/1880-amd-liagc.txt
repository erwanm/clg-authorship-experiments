"There, you may come down now. It wasn't so bad 
after all, but you 'll have to do it a sight better than that. 
Gad ! just think of an audience watching such a mite of a 
thing way up there, and not knowing whether she 'll come 
down alive or not. It's like the harrowin' part of a novel, 
when the hero's in some awful fix. People like that kind 
of suspense." 

He had her safely in his arms, but the heart beat fear- 
fully against his shoulder. 

" Sit down and rest. Here's a sup of wine for you ; 
why, you ain't much in the way of daring, after all. I hope 
I shan't lose money on you, and I must make a lot if you 
pay. I've a chap engaged that will beat Barretti all to 
nothing." 

Titania shuddered as she listened to the man's loud, im- 
portant voice, whose tones were exaggerated by the space 
and ghostly quiet. 

" There, you feel better now, don't you ? The wine put 
a little color in your face. Now I want you to try it 
again." 

She had hoped the cruel test was over, for this time. 
One glance she gave at the dizzy height, and then she 
almost shrieked, 





" Oh, don't make me ! I am tired, sick ! I should 
throw myself off, and be killed I Only wait until to-morrow. 
I will try then, indeed I will. Let me go home, and go to 
bed!" 

Her beseeching voice might have moved the mythical 
heart of a stone, and her strained, despairing face did touch 
the man. 

" Well," he returned, ungraciously, " but it won't do for 
you to cut up many such shines. I'll let you off to-day, 
you're a bit strange, I know. Get your hat, and come. 
Women always are the devil for contrariness, it's born in 
'em. But don't you try this trick over too often, or you'll 
see who is master I " 

She followed him through the tortuous piles of stage 
trumpery, and they emerged to daylight. Thomas kept a 
sharp eye on her, but he need not have feared. She was 
too spiritless to escape. 

The streets were full of children at play, with now and 
then a brawling mother rushing out to meet a little one, or 
a shrill voice calling from a window. Was everybody 
cruel to children ? It seemed so in her small experience. 
But Dick had loved her. 

Indeed, her life with Dick Bridger was clean and whole- 
some. Beyond the inseparable hardships of the training 
he had been indulgent. He had cared for her physical 
comforts with something beyond the mere reference to 
bodily well-being, tenderness, for the man was not hard 
or cruel from any delight in torture. When a point must 
be attained he took the shortest and most decisive way, 
even if it were sharp. 

Though the months with Kate had been delightfully 
luxurious, still she had missed the strong, sustaining 
affection. But to be plunged into this dreary desert ! 

" If I might go to my own room ? " she said, timidly, to 
Mrs. Thomas, as they entered the house. 

"Why, child, wait up and have some supper, do. 





Ranny's real good-natured now, and wants to see the 
pretty girl. I don't believe but what you could make 
quite friends with him. Come and see." 

"Oh no! no!" Titania cried convulsively. "I am so 
tired ! I do not want any supper. Please let me go to 
bed." 

"Let the child do as she likes!" said Owen Thomas, 
gruffly. 

" But it's so early." Then she caught sight of the tired 
little face. " Well," she continued, " maybe it will be best. 
There's nothing like a good rest, only it looks so queer to 
see a child willing to go to bed before dark. Come along, 
then. Your things are all up- stairs." 

She followed her hostess to the third floor, an old- 
fashioned attic, with dormer windows, the house being 
shared with another family. The Thomases had but one 
room up here. It was clean, but close and warm, and the 
bed looked inviting. 

" I expect you feel a bit strange, poor thing," and there 
was a motherly kindness in the voice. " Still, 'twould a 
been different if the woman that married what was her 
name ? had been any real kin. Blood's thicker 'n water, I 
always say, and you can't feel for anybody quite as you 
can for your own. I often think if I was dead there 'd be 
no one to care for Ranny, for fathers never seem to have 
the same feeling," and the illogical woman paused. 
" Shan't I help you take off your clothes ? " 

" No," said Titania, " And if you wouldn't mind going 
down-stairs." 

" O dear, no. But you're a queer little thing. Suppose 
I bring you up some tea ? " 

" No ! I don't want anything." 

" You're dead tired, that's it. I hope you'll rest comfortably. 
Good-by till morning." 

After she had gone a few steps she came back. 





" Maybe you'll leel safer to lock your door on the in 
side," she added, and changed the key. 

Titania locked it immediately. Then she threw hersell 
on the bed, and gave way to a flood of bitter, passionate 
tears. So young, and so miserable ! Cast out of home 
and love a thing for public amusement merely. How 
hideous it was! There were dim and undefined strivings 
of womanhood within, chaotic fancies, and remembrances 
that eluded her on every hand. Was life always to be 
thus? 

She hardly realized until now what a blow Kate's mar- 
riage had been to her, and she hated Mr. Chippenham 
with an unreasoning, impotent, but enduring hate. What 
would he do after he had taken all Kate's money ? Oh, 
if Kate could come back and care for her while she went 
on the stage, and if she could earn money enough for them 
both. And what right had Mr. Chippenham to sell her 
to this man ; for to her childish understanding she appeared 
as truly sold as the pretty dogs that changed owners now 
and then. First it had been Mother Mell who wanted to 
get rid of her, and then that vile, wolfish-looking man in 
the hideous den and Dick dear Dick oh, why did 
God take him away ! She did not hold against him the 
blows and severity, she remembered only the love, the 
care, the tenderness, and cried as if her heart were break- 
ing, until she fell asleep, still in her dress, overcome by
