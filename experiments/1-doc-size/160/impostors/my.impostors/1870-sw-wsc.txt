" I should say, if you doubt about any of 
her commands, you had better ask your 
mother, Tilly." 

" But I cannot see my mother, Mr. Richmond ; that is one of the things. Mamma 
is sick, and aunt Candy has forbidden me to 
go into her room. Must I stay out ? " 

" Is your mother so ill ? " 

" No sir, I do not think she is ; I don't 
know ; but aunt Candy says she is nervous ; 
and I must not go in there without leave." 
And Matilda raised appealing eyes to the 
minister. 

" That is hard, Tilly. I am very sorry to 
hear it. But I am of opinion that the authority of nurses must not be disputed. I think 
if Mrs. Candy says stay out, you had better 
stay out" 

" And everything else ? " said Matilda. 




" Must I mind what she says in everything 
else?" 

" Are you under her orders, Matilda ? " 

" That is what I want to know, Mr. Richmond. She says so. She told me not to 
go out to church last Sunday night ; and all 
the others were going, and I went too ; and 
she scolded about it and said I must mind 
her. Must I? in everything? I can't ask 
mamma." 

Mr. Richmond turned a paper-weight over 
and over two or three times without speak- 
ing. 

" You know what the fifth commandment 
is, Tilly." 

" Yes, Mr. Richmond. But she is not my 
mother." 

" Don't you think she is in your mother's 
place just now ? Would not your mother 
wish that your obedience should be given to 
your aunt for the present? " 

Matilda looked grave, not to say gloomy. 

" I can tell you what will make it easy," 




said Mr. Richmond. " Do it for the sake of 
the Lord Jesus. He set us an example of 
obedience to all lawful authorities ; he has 
commanded us to liv? in peace with everybody as far as we possibly can ; and to submit ourselves to one another in the fear of 
God. Besides that, I must think, Tilly, the 
command to obey our parents means also 
that we should obey whoever happens to 
stand in our parents' place to us. Will it not 
make it easy to obey your aunt, if you think 
that you are doing it to please God ! " 

" Yes, Mr. Richmond," Matilda said 
thoughtfully. 

" I always feel that God's command sweet- 
ens anything," the minister went on. " Do 
you feel so ? " 

I think I do ; " the little girl answered. 

" So if you stay at home for Mrs. Candy's 
command, you may reflect that it is for Jesus' 
sake ; and that will please him a great deal 
better than your" going to church to please 
yourself." 



" Yes, Mr. Richmond," Matilda said cheer- 
fully. 

" Was that all you had to talk to me 
about?" 

" Yes, sir all except about Band work." 

" We will talk about that in the meeting. 
If you have a question to ask, write it here ; 
and I will take it in and answer it." 

He gave Matilda paper and pen, and him- 
self put on his overcoat. Then taking her 
little slip of a question, the two went to 
gether into the Lecture room. 



CHAPTER XL 



was a good little gathering of the 
Workers, many of whom were quite 
young persons. Among them Matilda was 
not a little surprised to see Maria. But she 
warily sheered off from comments and questions, and took a seat in another part of the 
room. 

" We are here for a good talk to-night," 
said the minister, after they had sung and 
prayed. " I stand ready to meet difficulties 
and answer questions. All who have any 
more little notes to lay on the desk, please 
bring or send them up, or ask their questions 
by word of mouth. I will take the first of 
these that comes to hand." 

Mr. Richmond unfolded a paper and read 
it over to himself, in the midst of a hush of 
expectation. Then he read it aloud. 




" If a member of the Relief Committee 
visits a sick person in want of help, and finds 
another member of some other Committee 
giving the help and doing the work of the 
Relief Committee, which of them should take 
care of the case ? " 

" It is almost as puzzling," said Mr. Richmond, " as that other question, what husband 
the woman should have in the other world 
who had had seven in this. But as we are 
not just like the angels in heaven yet, I should 
say in this and similar cases, that the one 
who first found and undertook the case 
should continue her care, or his care, if 
he or she be so minded. The old rule of ' first 
come, first served,' is a good one, I think. 
The Relief Committee has no monopoly of 
the joy of helping others. Let us see what 
comes next." 

" There are four people I know, who go to 
read the Bible to one blind person and I 
know of at least two who are sick and unable 
to read, that nobody goes to."
