more of the harmonising to do, since they were four 
to one; but then she had gone through so much 



 

greater trials before. When the door of their 
carriage closed and it drove off with her and her 
husband to the station, she fetched a long sigh. 

" What is it ? " asked Corey, who ought to have 
known better. 

" Oh, nothing. I don't think I shall feel strange 
amongst the Mexicans now." 

He looked at her with a puzzled smile, which 
grew a little graver, and then he put his arm round 
her and drew her closer to him. This made her 
cry on his shoulder. " I only meant that I should 
have you all to myself." There is no proof that she 
meant more, but it is certain that our manners and 
customs go for more in life than our qualities. The 
price that we pay for civilisation is the fine yet im 
passable differentiation of these. Perhaps we pay 
too much ; but it will not be possible to persuade 
those who have the difference in their favour that 
this is so. They may be right ; and at any rate, the 
blank misgiving, the recurring sense of disappoint 
ment to which the young people's departure left the 
Coreys is to be considered. That was the end of 
their son and brother for them ; they felt that ; and 
they were not mean or unamiable people. 

He remained three years away. Some changes 
took place in that time. One of these was the pur 
chase by the Kanawha Falls Company of the mines 
and works at Lapham. The transfer relieved Lap- 
ham of the load of debt which he was still labouring 
under, and gave him an interest in the vaster enter 
prise of the younger men, which he had once vainly 



 

hoped to grasp all in his own hand. He began to 
tell of this coincidence as something very striking ; 
and pushing on more actively the special branch of 
the business left to him, he bragged, quite in his old 
way, of its enormous extension. His son-in-law, he 
said, was pushing it in Mexico and Central America : 
an idea that they had originally had in common. 
Well, young blood was what was wanted in a thing 
of that kind. Now, those fellows out in West 
Virginia : all young, and a perfect team ! 

For himself, he owned that he had made mis 
takes ; he could see just where the mistakes were 
put his finger right on them. But one thing he 
could say : he had been no man's enemy but his 
own ; every dollar, every cent had gone to pay his 
debts ; he had come out with clean hands. He said 
all this, and much more, to Mr. Sewell the summer 
after he sold out, when the minister and his wife 
stopped at Lapham on their way across from the 
White Mountains to Lake Champlain ; Lapham had 
found them on the cars, and pressed them to stop 
off. 

There were times when Mrs. Lapham had as great 
pride in the clean-handedness with which Lapham 
had come out as he had himself, but her satisfaction 
was not so constant. At those times, knowing the 
temptations he had resisted, she thought him the 
noblest and grandest of men ; but no woman could 
endure to live in the same house with a perfect 
hero, and there were other times when she reminded 
him that if he had kept his word to her about 



 

speculating in stocks, and had looked after the in 
surance of his property half as carefully as he had 
looked after a couple of worthless women who had 
no earthly claim on him, they would not he where 
they were now. He humbly admitted it all, and 
left her to think of Rogers herself. She did not 
fail to do so, and the thought did not fail to restore 
him to her tenderness again. 

I do not know how it is that clergymen and phy 
sicians keep from telling their wives the secrets 
confided to them ; perhaps they can trust their 
wives to find them out for themselves whenever 
they wish. Sewell had laid before his wife the 
case of the Laphams after they came to consult 
with him about Corey's proposal to Penelope, for 
he wished to be confirmed in his belief that he had 
advised them soundly ; but he had not given her 
their names, and he had not known Corey's him 
self. Now he had no compunctions in talking the 
affair over with her without the veil of ignorance 
which she had hitherto assumed, for she declared 
that as soon as she heard of Corey's engagement 
to Penelope, the whole thing had flashed upon her. 
"And that night at dinner I could have told the 
child that he was in love with her sister by the way 
he talked about her ; I heard him ; and if she had 
not been so blindly in love with him herself, she 
would have known it too. I must say, I can't help 
feeling a sort of contempt for her sister." 

"Oh, but you must not !" cried SewelL "That 



 

is wrong, cruelly wrong. I 'm sure that s out of 
your novel-reading, my dear, and not out of your 
heart. Come ! It grieves me to hear you say such 
a thing as that." 

" Oh, I dare say this pretty thing has got over it 
how much character she has got ! and I suppose 
she'll see somebody else." 

Sewell had to content himself with this partial 
concession. As a matter of fact, unless it was the 
young West Virginian who had come on to arrange 
the purchase of the Works, Irene had not yet seen 
any one, and whether there was ever anything be 
tween them is a fact that would need a separate in 
quiry. It is certain that at the end of five years 
after the disappointment which she met so bravely, 
she was still unmarried. But she was even then 
still very young, and her life at Lapham had been 
varied by visits to the West. It had also been 
varied by an invitation, made with the politest re 
solution by Mrs. Corey, to visit in Boston, which the 
girl was equal to refusing in the same spirit. 

Sewell was intensely interested in the moral spec 
tacle which Lapham presented under his changed 
conditions. The Colonel, who was more the Colonel 
in those hills than he could ever have been on the 
Back Bay, kept him and Mrs. Sewell over night at 
his house ; and he showed the minister minutely 
round the Works and drove him all over his farm. 
For this expedition he employed a lively colt which 
had not yet come of age, and an open buggy long 
past its prime, and was no more ashamed of his
