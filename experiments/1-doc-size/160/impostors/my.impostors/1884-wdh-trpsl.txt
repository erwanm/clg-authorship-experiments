" Why ! didn't you have a pleasant call ? " asked 
Penelope. 

Irene threw her arms round her. " Oh, it was a 
splendid call ! I didn't suppose I could make it go 
off so well. We talked nearly the whole time about 
you ! " 

" I don't think that was a very interesting sub 
ject." 

" He kept asking about you. He asked every 
thing. You don't know how much he thinks of 
you, Pen. Pen ! what do you think made him 
come ? Do you think he really did come to see how 
papa was ? " Irene buried her face in her sister's 
neck. 



 

Penelope stood with her arms at her side, sub 
mitting. "Well," she said, "I don't think he did, 
altogether." 

Irene, all glowing, released her. " Don't you 
don't you really ? Pen ! don't you think he is 
nice ? Don't you think he 's handsome ? Don't you 
think I behaved horridly when we first met him this 
evening, not thanking him for coming ? I know he 
thinks I Ve no manners. But it seemed as if it would 
be thanking him for coming to see me. Ought I to 
have asked him to come again, when he said good 
night ? I didn't ; I couldn't. Do you believe he 'll 
think I don't want him to ? You don't believe he 
would keep coming if he didn't want to " 

" He hasn't kept coming a great deal, yet," sug 
gested Penelope. 

" No ; I know he hasn't But if he if he 
should?" 

" Then I should think he wanted to." 

" Oh, would you would you ? Oh, how good you 
always are, Pen ! And you always say what you 
think. I wish there was some one coming to see 
you too. That's all that I don't like about it. 

Perhaps He was telling about his friend there 

in Texas " 

" Well," said Penelope, " his friend couldn't call 
often from Texas. You needn't ask Mr. Corey to 
trouble about me, 'Rene. I think I can manage to 
worry along, if you 're satisfied." 

" Oh, I am, Pen. When do you suppose he 'll 
come again ? " Irene pushed some of Penelope's 



 

things aside on the dressing-case, to rest her elbow 
and talk at ease. Penelope came up and put them 
back. 

"Well, not to-night," she said; "and if that's 
what you 're sitting up for " 

Irene caught her round the neck again, and ran 
out of the room. 

The Colonel was packed off on the eight o'clock 
boat the next morning; but his recovery did not 
prevent Corey from repeating his visit in a week. 
This time Irene came radiantly up to Penelope's 
room, where she had again withdrawn herself. 
" You must come down, Pen," she said. " He 's 
asked if you 're not well, and mamma says you 've 
got to come." 

After that Penelope helped Irene through with 
her calls, and talked them over with her far into 
the night after Corey was gone. But when the im 
patient curiosity of her mother pressed her for some 
opinion of the affair, she said, " You know as much 
as I do, mother." 

" Don't he ever say anything to you about her 
praise her up, any ? " 

" He 's never mentioned Irene to me." 

" He hasn't to me, either," said Mrs. Lapham, 
with a sigh of trouble. " Then what makes him 
keep coming ? " 

" I can't tell you. One thing, he says there isn't 
a house open in Boston where he's acquainted. 
Wait till some of his friends get back, and then if 
he keeps coming, it 'll be time to inquire." 



 


" Well ! " said the mother ; but as the weeks 
passed she was less and less able to attribute Corey's 
visits to his loneliness in town, and turned to her 
husband for comfort. 

" Silas, I don't know as we ought to let young 
Corey keep coming so. I don't quite like it, with 
all his family away." 

" He '& of age," said the Colonel. " He can go 
where he pleases. It don't matter whether his 
family 's here or not." 

" Yes, but if they don't want he should come ? 
Should you feel just right about letting him ?" 

" How 're you going to stop him ? I swear, 
Persis, I don't know what 's got over you ! What 
is it ? You didn't use to be so. But to hear you 
talk, you'd think those Coreys were too good for 
this world, and we wan't fit for 'em to walk on." 

" I'm not going to have 'em say we took an 
advantage of their being away and tolled him on." 

" I should like to hear 'em say it ! " cried Lapham. 
" Or anybody ! " 

" Well," said his wife, relinquishing this point of 
anxiety, " I can't make out whether he cares any 
thing for her or not. And Pen can't tell either ; or 
else she won't." 

" Oh, I guess he cares for her, fast enough," said 
the Colonel. 

" I can't make out that he 's said or done the 
first thing to show it." 

" Well, I was better than a year getting my 
courage up." 



 

"Oh, that was different," said Mrs. Lapham, in
