with gay stamps, giving them a very curious appearance.

“My dears! what new play have you got now? Are you wild Indians?
or letters that have gone round the world before finding the right
address?” she asked, laughing at the ridiculous sight, for both were as
sober as judges and deeply absorbed in some doubtful specimen.

“Oh, we just stuck them there to keep them safe; they get lost if we
leave them lying round. It’s very handy, for I can see in a minute what
I want on Jill’s face and she on mine, and put our fingers on the
right chap at once,” answered Jack, adding, with an anxious gaze at his
friend’s variegated countenance, “Where the dickens is my New Granada?
It’s rare, and I wouldn’t lose it for a dollar.”

“Why, there it is on your own nose. Don’t you remember you put it there
because you said mine was not big enough to hold it?” laughed Jill,
tweaking a large orange square off the round nose of her neighbor,
causing it to wrinkle up in a droll way, as the gum made the operation
slightly painful.

“So I did, and gave you Little Bolivar on yours. Now I’ll have Alsace
and Lorraine, 1870. There are seven of them, so hold still and see how
you like it,” returned Jack, picking the large, pale stamps one by one
from Jill’s forehead, which they crossed like a band.

She bore it without flinching, saying to herself with a secret smile, as
she glanced at the hot fire, which scorched her if she kept near enough
to Jack to help him, “This really is being like a missionary, with a
tattooed savage to look after. I have to suffer a little, as the good
folks did who got speared and roasted sometimes; but I won’t complain a
bit, though my forehead smarts, my arms are tired, and one cheek is as
red as fire.”

“The Roman States make a handsome page, don’t they?” asked Jack, little
dreaming of the part he was playing in Jill’s mind. “Oh, I say, isn’t
Corea a beauty? I’m ever so proud of that;” and he gazed fondly on a big
blue stamp, the sole ornament of one page.

“I don’t see why the Cape of Good Hope has pyramids. They ought to go in
Egypt. The Sandwich Islands are all right, with heads of the black kings
and queens on them,” said Jill, feeling that they were very appropriate
to her private play.

“Turkey has crescents, Australia swans, and Spain women’s heads, with
black bars across them. Frank says it is because they keep women shut
up so; but that was only his fun. I’d rather have a good, honest green
United States, with Washington on it, or a blue one-center with old
Franklin, than all their eagles and lions and kings and queens put
together,” added the democratic boy, with a disrespectful slap on a
crowned head as he settled Heligoland in its place.

“Why does Austria have Mercury on the stamp, I wonder? Do they wear
helmets like that?” asked Jill, with the brush-handle in her mouth as
she cut a fresh batch of flaps.

“May be he was postman to the gods, so he is put on stamps now. The
Prussians wear helmets, but they have spikes like the old Roman fellows.
I like Prussians ever so much; they fight splendidly, and always beat.
Austrians have a handsome uniform, though.”

“Talking of Romans reminds me that I have not heard your Latin for two
days. Come, lazybones, brace up, and let us have it now. I’ve done my
compo, and shall have just time before I go out for a tramp with Gus,”
 said Frank, putting by a neat page to dry, for he studied every day like
a conscientious lad as he was.

“Don’t know it. Not going to try till next week. Grind away over your
old Greek as much as you like, but don’t bother me,” answered Jack,
frowning at the mere thought of the detested lesson.

But Frank adored his Xenophon, and would not see his old friend,
Caesar, neglected without an effort to defend him; so he confiscated the
gum-pot, and effectually stopped the stamp business by whisking away at
one fell swoop all that lay on Jill’s table.

“Now then, young man, you will quit this sort of nonsense and do your
lesson, or you won’t see these fellows again in a hurry. You asked me to
hear you, and I’m going to do it; here’s the book.”

Frank’s tone was the dictatorial one, which Jack hated and always found
hard to obey, especially when he knew he ought to do it. Usually, when
his patience was tried, he strode about the room, or ran off for a race
round the garden, coming back breathless, but good-tempered. Now both
these vents for irritation were denied him, and he had fallen into
the way of throwing things about in a pet. He longed to send Caesar
to perpetual banishment in the fire blazing close by, but resisted the
temptation, and answered honestly, though gruffly: “I know I did, but I
don’t see any use in pouncing on a fellow when he isn’t ready. I haven’t
got my lesson, and don’t mean to worry about it; so you may just give me
back my things and go about your business.”

“I’ll give you back a stamp for every perfect lesson you get, and you
won’t see them on any other terms;” and, thrusting the treasures into
his pocket, Frank caught up his rubber boots, and went off swinging them
like a pair of clubs, feeling that he would give a trifle to be able to
use them on his lazy brother.

At this high-handed proceeding, and the threat which accompanied it,
Jack’s patience gave out, and catching up Caesar, as he thought, sent
him flying after the retreating tyrant with the defiant declaration,--

“Keep them, then, and your old book, too! I won’t look at it till you
give all my stamps back and say you are sorry. So now!”

It was all over before Mamma could interfere, or Jill do more than
clutch and cling to the gum-brush. Frank vanished unharmed, but the poor
book dashed against the wall to fall half open on the floor, its gay
cover loosened, and its smooth leaves crushed by the blow.

“It’s the album! O Jack, how could you?” cried Jill, dismayed at sight
of the precious book so maltreated by the owner.

“Thought it was the other. Guess it isn’t hurt much. Didn’t mean to
hit him, any way. He does provoke me so,” muttered Jack, very red and
shamefaced as his mother picked up the book and laid it silently on
the table before him. He did not know what to do with himself, and was
thankful for the stamps still left him, finding great relief in making
faces as he plucked them one by one from his mortified countenance. Jill
looked on, half glad, half sorry that her savage showed such signs of
unconverted ferocity, and Mrs. Minot went on writing letters, wearing
the grave look her sons found harder to bear than another person’s
scolding. No one spoke for a moment, and the silence was becoming
awkward when Gus appeared in a rubber suit, bringing a book to Jack from
Laura and a note to Jill from Lotty.

“Look here, you just trundle me into my den, please, I’m going to have a
nap, it’s so dull to-day I don’t feel like doing much,” said Jack, when
Gus had done his errands, trying to look as if he knew nothing about the
fracas.

Jack folded his arms and departed like a warrior borne from the
battle-field, to be chaffed unmercifully for a “pepper-pot,” while Gus
made him comfortable in his own room.

“I heard once of a boy who threw a fork at his brother and put his eye
out. But he didn’t mean to, and the brother forgave him, and he never
did so any more,” observed Jill, in a pensive tone, wishing to show that
she felt all the dangers of impatience, but was sorry for the culprit.

“Did the boy ever forgive himself?” asked Mrs. Minot.

“No, ‘m; I suppose not. But Jack didn’t hit Frank, and feels real sorry,
I know.”

“He might have, and hurt him very much. Our actions are in our own
hands, but the consequences of them are not. Remember that, my dear, and
think twice before you do anything.”

“Yes, ‘m, I will;” and Jill composed herself to consider what
missionaries usually did when the natives hurled tomahawks and
boomerangs at one another, and defied the rulers of the land.

Mrs. Minot wrote one page of a new letter, then stopped, pushed her
papers about, thought a little, and finally got up, saying, as if she
found it impossible to resist the yearning of her heart for the naughty
boy,--

“I am going to see if Jack is covered up, he is so helpless, and liable
to take cold. Don’t stir till I come back.”
