It was about this time that Miss Kelso at- 
tempted, in view of Sip's increasing care, a long- 
cherished plan of experiment in taking the girl 
out of the mills. 

" It is not a girl to spend life in weaving 
cotton," said the young lady to Stephen Garrick. 
" That would be such exorbitant waste." 

" There 's waste enough at those looms," said 
Mr. Garrick, pointing to his mills, " to enrich a 
Commonwealth perceptibly. We live fast down 
there among the engines. It is hot-house 
growth. There's the difference between a man 
brought up at machinery and a man brought 





up at a hoe, for instance, that there is between 
forced fruit and frozen fruit. Few countries 
understand what possibilities they possess in 
their factory population. We are a fever in the 
national blood that it will not pay to neglect ; 
there 's kill or cure in us." 

" What 's the use .' " said Sip, with sullen, 
unresponsive eyes. " You 'll have all your bother 
for nothing. Miss Kelso. If I get away from my 
loom, I shall come back to my loom. Look at 
the factory-folks in England ! From father to 
child, from children to children's children, — a 
whole race of 'em at their looms. It 's in the 
blood." 

"Try it," urged Perley. "Try it for Catty's 
sake, at least. There are so many ways in which 
it would be better for Catty." 

"I should like it," said Sip, slowly, "to get 
Catty among some other folks than mill-folks. 
It seems as if I could have done it once ; but 
it 's too late now." 

Now Sip was barely twenty-one. She said 
this with the unconscious assurance of fifty. 

" I 'd try anything for Catty ; and almost 
anything for you ; and almost anything to get 
out of the mills ; but I 'm afraid it 's too late." 




But Perley was persistent in her fancy, and 
between them they managed to " try it " 
faithfully. 

Sip went out as somebody's cook, and burned 
all the soup and made sour bread. She drew 
about a baby's carriage for a day and a half, and 
left because the baby cried and she was afraid 
that she should shake it. She undertook to be a 
hotel table-girl, and was saucy to the house- 
keeper before night. She took a specimen of 
her sewing to a dressmaker, and was told that 
the establishment did not find itself in need of 
another seamstress. She stood behind a dry- 
goods counter, but it worried her to measure off 
calico for the old ladies. Finally, Perley put her 
at the printer's trade, and Sip had a headache 
and got inky for a fortnight. 

Then she walked back to her overseer, and 
" asked in " for the next morning. 

" I told you it was no use," she said, shaking 
her head at Miss Kelso, half whimsically, half 
sadly too. " It 's too late. What am I fit for ?
Nothing. What do I know .' Nothing. I can 
weave ; that 's all. I 'm used to that. I 'm used 
to the noise and the running about. I 'm used to 





the dirt and the roughness. I can't sit still on 
a high stool all day. I don't know how to spell, 
if I do. They 're too fussy for me in the ,shops. 
I hate babies. It's too late. I'm spoiled. I 
knew I should come back. My father and mother 
came back before me. It 's in the blood." 

Parley would have liked even then, had it 
seemed practicable, to educate the girl ; but Sip 
shook her dogged head. 

" It 's too late for that, too. Once I would 
have liked that. There 's things I think I could 
ha' done." Sip's sullen eyes wandered slowly 
to the plunging dream and the solitary dreamer 
behind the china-closet door, and, resting there, 
flashed suddenly. " There 's things I seem to 
think I might ha' done with that ; but I 've lost 
'em now. Nor that ain't the worst. I 've lost the 
caring for 'em, — that's the thing I've lost. If I 
was to sit still and study at a grammar, I should 
scream. I must go back to the noise and the 
dirt. Catty and me must stay there. Some- 
times I seem to think that I might have been a 
little different someways ; if maybe I 'd been 
helped or shown. There was an evening school 
to one place where I worked. I was running four 





looms twelve hours and a half a day. You 're so 
dull about the head, you see, when you get home 
from work ; and you ache so ; and you don't feel 
that interest in an education that you might." 

" Sometimes," added Sip, with a working of 
the face, " it comes over me as if I was like a — 
a patchwork bed-quilt. I 'd like to have been 
made out of one piece of cloth. It seems as if 
your kind of folks got made iirst, and we down 
here was put together out of what was left. 

" Sometimes, though," continued the girl, " I 
wonder how there came to be so much of me as 
there is. I don't set up for much, but I wonder 
why I wasn't worse. I believe you would your- 
self, if you knew." 

" Knew what ? " 

"Knew what ! " echoed the factory-girl. " Knew 
that as you know no more of than you know of 
hell ! Haven't I told you that you cant know ? 
You can't understand. If I was to tell you, you 
couldn't understand. It ain't so much the 
bringing up I got, as the smooch of it. That 's 
the wonder of it. You may be ever so clean, 
but you don't feel clean if you 're born in the 
black. Why, look here ; there was my mother, 






into the mills off and on between her babies. 
There 's me, from the time I run alone, run- 
ning alone. She comes home at night. I 'm 
off about the street all day. I learned to swear 
when I learned to talk. Before I 'd learned to
