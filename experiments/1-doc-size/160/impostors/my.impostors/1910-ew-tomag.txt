BETTON did not for a moment believe that Vyse suspected the valet of
having written the letters.

“Why the devil don’t he say out what he thinks? He was always a tortuous
chap,” he grumbled inwardly.

The sense of being held under the lens of Vyse’s mute scrutiny became
more and more exasperating. Betton, by this time, had squared his
shoulders to the fact that “Abundance” was a failure with the public:
a confessed and glaring failure. The press told him so openly, and
his friends emphasized the fact by their circumlocutions and evasions.
Betton minded it a good deal more than he had expected, but not nearly
as much as he minded Vyse’s knowing it. That remained the central
twinge in his diffused discomfort. And the problem of getting rid of his
secretary once more engaged him.

He had set aside all sentimental pretexts for retaining Vyse; but a
practical argument replaced them. “If I ship him now he’ll think it’s
because I’m ashamed to have him see that I’m not getting any more
letters.”

For the letters had ceased again, almost abruptly, since Vyse had
hazarded the conjecture that they were the product of Strett’s devoted
pen. Betton had reverted only once to the subject--to ask ironically,
a day or two later: “Is Strett writing to me as much as ever?”--and, on
Vyse’s replying with a neutral head-shake, had added with a laugh: “If
you suspect him you might as well think I write the letters myself!”

“There are very few to-day,” said Vyse, with his irritating evasiveness;
and Betton rejoined squarely: “Oh, they’ll stop soon. The book’s a
failure.”

A few mornings later he felt a rush of shame at his own tergiversations,
and stalked into the library with Vyse’s sentence on his tongue.

Vyse started back with one of his anaemic blushes. “I was hoping you’d
be in. I wanted to speak to you. There’ve been no letters the last day
or two,” he explained.

Betton drew a quick breath of relief. The man had some sense of decency,
then! He meant to dismiss himself.

“I told you so, my dear fellow; the book’s a flat failure,” he said,
almost gaily.

Vyse made a deprecating gesture. “I don’t know that I should regard
the absence of letters as the ultimate test. But I wanted to ask you
if there isn’t something else I can do on the days when there’s no
writing.” He turned his glance toward the book-lined walls. “Don’t you
want your library catalogued?” he asked insidiously.

“Had it done last year, thanks.” Betton glanced away from Vyse’s face.
It was piteous, how he needed the job!

“I see. ... Of course this is just a temporary lull in the letters.
They’ll begin again--as they did before. The people who read carefully
read slowly--you haven’t heard yet what they think.”

Betton felt a rush of puerile joy at the suggestion. Actually, he hadn’t
thought of that!

“There was a big second crop after ‘Diadems and Faggots,’” he mused
aloud.

“Of course. Wait and see,” said Vyse confidently.

The letters in fact began again--more gradually and in smaller numbers.
But their quality was different, as Vyse had predicted. And in two
cases Betton’s correspondents, not content to compress into one rapid
communication the thoughts inspired by his work, developed their views
in a succession of really remarkable letters. One of the writers was
a professor in a Western college; the other was a girl in Florida. In
their language, their point of view, their reasons for appreciating
“Abundance,” they differed almost diametrically; but this only made
the unanimity of their approval the more striking. The rush of
correspondence evoked by Betton’s earlier novel had produced nothing
so personal, so exceptional as these communications. He had gulped the
praise of “Diadems and Faggots” as undiscriminatingly as it was offered;
now he knew for the first time the subtler pleasures of the palate. He
tried to feign indifference, even to himself; and to Vyse he made no
sign. But gradually he felt a desire to know what his secretary thought
of the letters, and, above all, what he was saying in reply to them.
And he resented acutely the possibility of Vyse’s starting one of his
clandestine correspondences with the girl in Florida. Vyse’s notorious
lack of delicacy had never been more vividly present to Betton’s
imagination; and he made up his mind to answer the letters himself.

He would keep Vyse on, of course: there were other communications that
the secretary could attend to. And, if necessary, Betton would invent an
occupation: he cursed his stupidity in having betrayed the fact that his
books were already catalogued.

Vyse showed no surprise when Betton announced his intention of dealing
personally with the two correspondents who showed so flattering a
reluctance to take their leave. But Betton immediately read a criticism
in his lack of comment, and put forth, on a note of challenge: “After
all, one must be decent!”

Vyse looked at him with an evanescent smile. “You’ll have to explain
that you didn’t write the first answers.”

Betton halted. “Well--I--I more or less dictated them, didn’t I?”

“Oh, virtually, they’re yours, of course.”

“You think I can put it that way?”

“Why not?” The secretary absently drew an arabesque on the blotting-pad.
“Of course they’ll keep it up longer if you write yourself,” he
suggested.

Betton blushed, but faced the issue. “Hang it all, I sha’n’t be sorry.
They interest me. They’re remarkable letters.” And Vyse, without
observation, returned to his writings.

The spring, that year, was delicious to Betton. His college professor
continued to address him tersely but cogently at fixed intervals, and
twice a week eight serried pages came from Florida. There were other
letters, too; he had the solace of feeling that at last “Abundance” was
making its way, was reaching the people who, as Vyse said, read slowly
because they read intelligently. But welcome as were all these proofs
of his restored authority they were but the background of his happiness.
His life revolved for the moment about the personality of his two
chief correspondents. The professor’s letters satisfied his craving for
intellectual recognition, and the satisfaction he felt in them proved
how completely he had lost faith in himself. He blushed to think that
his opinion of his work had been swayed by the shallow judgments of
a public whose taste he despised. Was it possible that he had allowed
himself to think less well of “Abundance” because it was not to
the taste of the average novel-reader? Such false humility was less
excusable than the crudest appetite for praise: it was ridiculous to
try to do conscientious work if one’s self-esteem were at the mercy
of popular judgments. All this the professor’s letters delicately
and indirectly conveyed to Betton, with the result that the author of
“Abundance” began to recognize in it the ripest flower of his genius.

But if the professor understood his book, the girl in Florida understood
him; and Betton was fully alive to the superior qualities of
discernment which this process implied. For his lovely correspondent
his novel was but the starting-point, the pretext of her discourse: he
himself was her real object, and he had the delicious sense, as their
exchange of thoughts proceeded, that she was interested in “Abundance”
 because of its author, rather than in the author because of his book. Of
course she laid stress on the fact that his ideas were the object of
her contemplation; but Betton’s agreeable person had permitted him some
insight into the incorrigible subjectiveness of female judgments, and he
was pleasantly aware, from the lady’s tone, that she guessed him to be
neither old nor ridiculous. And suddenly he wrote to ask if he might see
her. ...

The answer was long in coming. Betton fumed at the delay, watched,
wondered, fretted; then he received the one word “Impossible.”

He wrote back more urgently, and awaited the reply with increasing
eagerness. A certain shyness had kept him from once more modifying the
instructions regarding his mail, and Strett still carried the letters
directly to Vyse. The hour when he knew they were passing under the
latter’s eyes was now becoming intolerable to Betton, and it was a
