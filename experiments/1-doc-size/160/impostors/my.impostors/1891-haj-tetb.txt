"Just as I thought," he said, with a nod to the clerk.

"What is that?' gasped Fred.

"It appears to be a watch and chain," answered Ferguson coolly.
"Possibly you can tell me how it came there."

"I know nothing about it," said Fred in dire amazement.

"You do not claim it as yours, then?"

"Certainly not. I never saw it before in my life."

"Is this shirt yours?"

"Yes."

"You brought it with you?"

"Yes."

"Let me open the watch. Do you see this inscription?"

Fred and the clerk approached, and on the inside of the case read the
name, "Philo Carver, Elmira, 1865."

"You see? This is one of the articles stolen from Mr. Carver's house
yesterday afternoon. It is a little odd that this young man in whose
bundle I find it cannot explain its presence."

"You may believe me or not," said Fred desperately, "but it is true all
the same. I know nothing of this watch or chain, and I never saw either
before. Can you tell me what other articles were taken by the burglar?"

"Some government bonds, and a small sum of bank bills."

"Then you had better search for them also here: I will help you all I
can."

"Well, you are a cool hand."

"No; I am innocent, that is all."

"It is pretty clear you have nothing else with you, or you wouldn't be
so willing. However, I consider it my duty to do as you suggest."

He hunted under the mattresses, and finally examined Fred's pockets. At
last he felt in the inside vest pocket and drew out the gold coins.

"Ha, we have something here!" he exclaimed.

"Yes," answered Fred, "but those happen to belong to me."

"Where did you get them?"

"From a friend in New York. He intrusted them to me to use if I needed.
Meanwhile I was to put them in the savings bank."

"Not a very likely story," said the detective suspiciously.

"Likely or not, it is a true story. Does this man Carver claim to have
lost any gold coins?"

"No."

"I thought not."

"However, we come back to the inquiry--where did you get the watch?"

"The man who slept in the room with me must have left it here to throw
suspicion on me," said Fred, with sudden inspiration.

"That is possible," said the clerk, who was favorably impressed by
Fred's manner.

"We must not jump at conclusions," said the detective warily. "I shall
feel justified in detaining the boy after what I have found."

"You won't take me to the station house?" said Fred nervously.

"No; it will answer the purpose if you are locked up in this room--for
the present."

"Then," said Fred, turning to the clerk, "I shall be much obliged if
you will send me up some breakfast."

"It shall be done."

Within half an hour Fred was discussing a beefsteak and fried potatoes
with hearty enjoyment. It takes a good deal to spoil the appetite of a
healthy boy of seventeen.




CHAPTER XII.

FRED AS A PRISONER.

After breakfast Fred became restless. It was tantalizing to be so near
the Falls, and yet to be locked up, and prevented from seeing them. Of
course it would all come right in time, but it was hard to bear the
suspense and confinement. Hunting round the room he found a juvenile
book, and sitting down at the window read it. It helped to while away
the time till twelve o'clock. He had scarcely read the last page when
he heard the key turning in the lock outside. The door opened and two
persons appeared at the entrance. One was the clerk the other a boy,
rather short, with a bright, attractive face.

"I thought you might like company," said the clerk in a friendly
manner. "This is my young cousin, Frank Hamblin, who will remain with
yon for a while."

"I am glad to see you, Frank," said Fred offering his hand. "You are
very kind to come and see a bold, bad burglar."

"You don't look much like it," said Frank, laughing. "Still appearances
are deceitful."

"I don't think I look wicked," said Fred meditatively, as he glanced at
his reflection in a small mirror that hung over the washstand. "Yet it
appears that I have broken into a gentleman's house in Elmira, and
stolen a gold watch and chain and some government bonds."

"How could you do it?" asked Frank with much seriousness. "So young and
yet so wicked!"

"That's the question that puzzles me," said Fred. "How could I do it
when at the time the burglary was committed I was speeding over the
Erie road at the rate of thirty miles an hour?"

"Can you prove this?" asked Frank eagerly.

"Certainly I could, if the conductor or brakeman of my car were here."

"Where are they?"

"Probably on their way back to New York."

"Do you live there?"

"Yes."

"I have always wanted to see the city of New York. It must be a gay
place."

"You are right there, Frank. Whenever you do come, just inquire for
Fred Fenton, and I will show you round. There is my address."

"Thank you! I should like it ever so much. Have you ever been here
before?"

"No. I wanted very much to see the Falls, but here I am locked up in a
hotel chamber. I wish the Falls were visible from the window."

"They are on the other side of the house."

"Do you know this detective--the one that searched me?"
