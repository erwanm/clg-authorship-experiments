fully tug them out in search of the sea. I shall 
convert all these wandering investments into cash 
as soon as possible, at any reasonable sacrifice, for 
I fancy there can't be more than three or four 
thousand involved at most. The property is 
widely scattered, much of it in local loans, like 
that of most Maine merchants. My share, as you 
remember, is more concise. Write when you can. 
Remember me to cousin Don. Don't miss me. It 
doesn't  pay. Your affectionate son, 

WALDO YORKE. 

Waldo Yorke had started in search of the post- 
office to mail this letter, when Mrs. Isaiah Butter- 
well followed her guest to the door, and stood, 
while he was gathering the reins over the now 
gayly-recuperated Bangor pony. Mrs. Butterwell 
was a well-di-essed woman, in the Maine sense of 
the term. She had a homely, independent face, 
with soft eyes, not unlike a linnet's, as Yorke 
had said. She regarded him closely for a moment, 
and without speaking. 

" What a charming day ! " said Yorke, feeling 
it necessary to be polite even at the expense of 
originality. 

" I'm too busy to bother with the weather," re- 



 

plied Mrs. Isaiah, briskly. " Can't spare the time 
for that Down East." 

" Indeed ! That is a frugal sentiment, at all 
events," Yorke ventured. 

" There 's no sentiment about it," retorted Mrs. 
Butterwell. " It 's sense ; as you 'd find out if 
you lived here. If I 'd spent myself noticing 
weather, I should have been in my grave ten win 
ters ago. Are you fond of young women? " 

The linnet put this startling question with gen 
tle eyes, in which it was impossible to capture a 
ray of satire or of fun. 

" As I am of the State of Maine, with reservations," 
said Yorke guardedly, visions of
Sherman " society " presenting themselves at once. 

" Are you fond of an early dinner, then ? " pur 
sued Mrs. Butterwell, with the serene air of one 
who clearly sees the links of her own syllogism. 

" Passionately, madam." 

"We dine," said the hostess, bowing herself 
away with a certain dignity, " at half past 
twelve." 

" I will be at my post," said the guest, smiling, 
" dead or alive I " 

" I wouldn't say that if I was you," urged Mrs. 
Isaiah Butterwell, returning to the door-step, and 
looking gravely at the young man. " I 've always 



 

thought, if I 'd been God, I 'd have been tempted 
to take people up that way, just for the sake of it. 
Talk about his tempting folks ! Folks throw a 
terrible lot of temptation in his way. But there 
it is. It just shows he isn't made up like other 
people, after all. How that horse of yours does 
fuss ! " 

The Bangor pony was nervous indeed that 
morning ; highly grained, after the journey, in Mr. 
Isaiah 's generous stable. The buggy sped along 
the village street with emphasis. 

It is doubtful if the caryatid would have offered 
her services as guide to its occupant that day, 
through the beautiful heart of the forest, four 
miles deep. 

Waldo Yorke, as he clattered through that 
pleasant representative Maine town, where the 
meeting-house, post-office, and " store " were the 
important features, and impressed him chiefly as 
reminiscences of American novels which he had 
tried to read and failed at the third chapter, 
amused himself by a rapid acquaintance with the 
business signs. 

"Goodsell, Merchant." "Cole and Wood: 
Lumber Dealers." " Dr. A. Lloyd." " Coffins, 
cheap for Cash." " Smith and Jones, formerly 
Jedediah Yorke," and so on. He got these 



 

things into his head as he had the rhyme of Lucy 
Gray, the day before, with that idiocy which as 
serts itself in this exasperating form, and which 
threatens to prove the human intellect more law 
less than the passions or the will. He found him 
self particularly a victim to the cheerful refrain of 
" Coffins, cheap for Cash." 

His host overtook him before he had driven far. 
Mr. Isaiah Butterwell, as Yorke had observed, 
shared the apparently well-spread Maine appreciation
of a good horse. He reined up his heavy, 
handsome sorrel, and the two men rode abreast 
for a mile ; they chatted, across wheels, of horses, 
the estate and Uncle Jed, and Maine politics, and 
the price of lumber, and horses again. The Bos 
ton boy listened deferentially to the gray Maine 
merchant ; perceiving in him something of the 
same rugged dignity that Uncle Jed had borne in 
Beacon Street. Yorke felt that here was a king 
in his own country ; he regarded the hard-worked 
man with respect, and pleased himself with draw 
ing his points out, and storing them up, so to 
speak, with a sense of increasing one 's knowledge 
of " types." 

" I 've got to leave you, to collect some inter 
est," said Mr. Butterwell presently. " That 's 
my turn, the first right. You keep straight on 



 

till you find your man. Drive easy over the 
bridges. They're plaguey rickety, some of em. 
That pony of yours ain't used to em in Bangor. 
Back to dinner ? Hope so. There, now, I 
wonder if my wife has told you whoa ! told 
you about whoa, Zach Chandler ! about 
Whoa!" 

" Oh, yes, she told me ! " called Yorke politely,
