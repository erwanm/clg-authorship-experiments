her deliverance from doubt and fear, and before she could twinkle them
back, broke into smaller brilliants upon her cheeks and the bosom of
her dress. It was very babyish and foolish, but it is to be questioned
whether she could have contrived a more telling situation had she
studied it for a month.

“What is it!” inquired Frederic, kindly, not releasing the fingers that
twitched, more than struggled, in his. “Have you been frightened?”

“Yes,” with grieved, but fearless simplicity, “I was frightened because
I thought I had offended you--perhaps driven you away--and that I should
never be able to ask your forgiveness for my cruel abruptness last
night! In thinking about and worrying over this, I somehow lost my way,
and was just trying to remember by what route I reached this strange
neighborhood, when your appearance startled me.”

“You did not know, then, that this is Bachelor’s Hall--the haunt of
unmated Benedicts, wifeless visitors to the city, and celibate M. C.’s?”
 he rejoined, pleasantly. “Let me be your guide to more desirable as well
as more accessible quarters!”

On the stairs he bent to scan her blushing countenance.

“How am I to punish you for your naughty distrust of my friendship and
common sense? I have been too busy all day to spare a minute for social
pleasure. I dined at two o’clock, having an appointment at three,
returned at half-past five, and was just coming down to your parlor to
look you up. Another bit of unimportant news, with which I should
not have annoyed you if you had not merited a little vexation by your
preposterous fancies, is, that, instead of taking an early train to
Philadelphia, I have to-day entered into engagements that will oblige me
to prolong my stay in this place until the first of February.”

He looked bright and cheerful, ready for sport or badinage. Rosa caught
herself wondering many times during that evening, and the succeeding
days of the three weeks they passed under the same roof, if she had
dreamed of--not beheld with her bodily optics--that one stormy burst
of passion which had been his farewell to the hope of a final
reconciliation with Mabel Aylett.

He never spoke of her again, or referred, in the most distant manner,
to his visit at Ridgeley. The omission was an agreeable one to Rosa for
several reasons. Silence, she believed, was to oblivion as a means to an
end. Judging from herself, she adopted the theory that people were apt
to forget what they never talked of themselves, nor heard mentioned by
others. Furthermore, she was relieved from the necessity of concocting
diplomatic evasions, dexterously skirting the truth, to say nothing
of plump falsehoods. These last cost her conscience some unpleasant
twinges. To avoid narrating in full what had happened was a work of art.
A downright lie was a stroke of heavy business, unsuited to her airy
genius--and when the Aylett-Chilton complication was upon the tapis, it
was difficult to avoid undertaking such.

For three weeks, then, Mr. Frederic Chilton and the Virginian belle
visited concert, theatre, and assembly-room in company, sat side by
side in the spectators’ gallery of House and Senate chamber, walked
in daylight along the broad avenues from one magnificent distance to
another, and on home-evenings--which were not many--chatted together
familiarly, the well-pleased Masons thought confidentially, by the
fireside in the family parlor. It must not be inferred from their
constant intercourse that he had the field entirely to himself.
Gallants of divers pretensions--first-class, mediocre, and
contemptible--considered with a practical eye to “settlement,” hovered
about the fascinating witch as moths about a gas-burner, and had no
citable cause of complaint of non-appreciation, inasmuch as she shed
equal light upon all, save one. “My very old friend, Mr. Chilton,”
 she was wont to denominate him in conversation with those who inwardly
called themselves fools for their jealousy of a man of whom she spoke
thus frankly, with never a stammer or blush; yet they acknowledged to
themselves all the while that they were both suspicious and envious of
his superior advantages. However backward Frederic may have been in the
beginning to monopolize the notice and time of his “sisterly friend,”
 he was not an insensate block, who could not perceive and value
the compliment paid him by her partiality--ever apparent, but never
unmaidenly. Impute it to whatever motive he might, the distinction
titillated his vanity, touched, at least, the outermost covering of
his heart. It might be pity, it might be pleasant, mournful memories of
other days--it was most likely of all a sincere platonic affection, for
one with tastes and feelings akin to hers that gave lustre to her eyes,
and gentle meaning to her smile when he drew near. At any rate, it would
be churlish not to accept the preference these conveyed, and to like
her and his position as her chosen knight better every day; it was
inevitable that he should marvel--not without melancholy-at the flight
of time that brought so soon the day of parting.

The Masons, with himself, were engaged to attend a large party on the
last evening of January. Without analyzing the impulse that constrained
him to do so, he had refrained from reminding Rosa that his stay in
Washington was so nearly over, and, with masculine consistency, he was
half disposed to be affronted that she had forgotten what he had said
to her of its extent. He had never seen her more lively--in more radiant
spirits and looks--than she was upon the night of the 30th. He had
dropped into her aunt’s parlor about ten o’clock, and detected Rosa in
the act of dragging her new ball-dress from the box in which the mantua
maker had sent it home.

“Conceive, if you can--but you can’t, being a man--what I have undergone
for an hour and more!” she cried, at seeing him. “My treasure--the
darlingest love of a dress I have ever ordered--was brought in exactly
two seconds before a brace of honorables--lumbering machines that they
are! knocked at the door. So, lest they should brand me as a frivolous
doll (as if anybody with a soul, and an infinitesimal degree of love for
the beautiful, COULD help admiring the divine thing!), I pushed the poor
box under the sofa, and there it has lain in ignominious neglect, like
a pearl of purest ray serene smothered in an oyster, all the time they
were here. I was purposely cross and stupid, too, in the hope of
getting rid of them the sooner. If you despise what most of your
undiscriminating sex call fancy articles, consider a woman’s fondness
for a ravishing robe despicable and irrational, Mr. Chilton, you need
not look this way. You could hardly have a severer--certainly not a more
appropriate--punishment.”

“You depreciate my aesthetic proclivities,” he rejoined, catching her
tone. “You would not trust my bungling fingers to help excavate the
gem, I know; but I may surely use my eyes--admire, as we bid children
do--with my hands behind my back.”

Notwithstanding his boast of knowingness in the mysteries of feminine
apparel, he could not have told of what material the divine robe was
made--except that it was some shiny white stuff, with wide embroidery
upon the flounces. But Rosa, her aunt, and cousin had gone into
ecstacies over it, and instigated by kind-hearted Mrs. Mason, the
enraptured owner had rushed off to Mrs. Mason’s chamber to try it on,
returning presently in full array, elate at the “perfect fit,” and
insisting upon a unanimous declaration that she “had never before worn
anything one-thousandth part as becoming.”

“It is a winsome, fantastic, enchanting little being!” remarked Mr.
Chilton, in soliloquy at his dressing-table, the next evening. “I hope
she will enjoy the gathering to-night, as she hopes to do. Will she miss
me at the next she attends?”

Then--laughing at the sentimental visage portrayed upon the mirror--“It
would be the acme of ludicrous folly for me to disturb myself on that
score. We have had a pleasant time together--she and I--and tomorrow it
will be over. There is the whole story--except that, in a month I shall
cease to think of her, unless her name is accidentally uttered in my
hearing--I wish I could forget some other things as easily!--and
she will probably be the affianced darling of one of the lumbering
Honorables--the elder and homelier of the brace, I fancy, since he is
the wealthier, and the humming-bird should have a fitting cage.”

Expressing in his composed lineaments and firm stride nothing like
disconsolateness at the programme, he flung his cloak over his arm, took
his white gloves in his hand, cast a passing glance at the glass to see
that his whiskers and hair were in order, and ran down the two flights
of stairs lying between Bachelor’s Hall and the Masons’ private parlor.

“Come in!” said a plaintive voice, in answer to his knock.

Rosa was alone in the cosy apartment. She was curled up in a great
padded chair, set upon the hearth-rug. Her dress was a plain black
silk; she wore a scarlet shawl, and her head-gear was some odd, but
distractingly pretty construction of white lace, a square folded in two
unequal triangles, and knotted loosely, handkerchief-wise, the points in
front, under her chin.

“Not ready!” exclaimed Frederic, in merry reproach. “You, the model of
punctual women!”
