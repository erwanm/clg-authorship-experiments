Jeffrey Andsdell had stated his case. He was tired of desultory
wandering, and seven-and-twenty was high time to take up some life
work. He was the fourth son of a titled family, with no especial
longing for the army or the church, therefore he, like other young men
without prospects, had emigrated. The heir to the title and estates,
the elder brother, was married and had two sons, the next one was
married also, but so far had only girls, and the entail was in the
male line. The brother next older than Jeffrey had been a sort of
imbecile, and died. But there was no chance of his succeeding, so he
must make his own way. He had spent two years at Richmond and
Williamsburg, then at Philadelphia. At Williamsburg he had taken quite
a fancy to the stage, and achieved some success, but the company had
disbanded. It was a rather precarious profession at best, though he
had tried a little of it in London.

The straightforward story tallied with Captain Forbes' information.
True, there was one episode he had not dwelt upon, it would never come
up in this new life. How he had been crazy enough to take such a step
he could not now imagine. But it was over, and done with, and
henceforward life should be an honorable success.

Daffodil listened between counting her stitches. She stole shy glances
now and then, he sat so the firelight threw up his face in strong
relief. The brown hair had a little tumbled look, the remnant of some
boyish curls. The features were good, rather of the aquiline order,
the eyes well opened, of a sort of nondescript hazel, the brown beard
worn in the pointed style, with a very narrow moustache, for the upper
lip was short and the smiling aspect not quite hidden.

When he rose to go the ladies rose also. He shook hands, and held
Daffodil's a moment with a pressure that brought a faint color to her
soft cheek.

"He is very much of a gentleman," commented Mrs. Bradin. "And, taking
up a steady occupation is greatly to his credit. Though it seems as if
a soldier's life would have been more to his taste."

"I am glad he did not fight against us," said Barbe.

"Some have, and have repented," added her husband, with a touch of
humor in his tone. "And we are large-minded enough to forgive them."

Daffodil did not see him until she went over to the Fort. Langdale
dropped in to see her, but there was no cordial invitation to remain.
He knew later on that Andsdell was there, and in his heart he felt it
was not Archie who would be his strongest rival. If there was
something that could be unearthed against the Englishman!

The Remsens, mother and son, were very agreeable people, quite
singers, but there was no piano for accompaniment, though there were
flutes and violins at the Fort. Andsdell, after some pressing, sang
also, and his voice showed training. Then he repeated a scene from
"The Tempest" that enchanted his hearers. Daffodil was curiously proud
of him.

"You did not haunt the woods much," he began on the way home. "I
looked for you."

"Did you?" Her heart beat with delicious pleasure. "But I did not
promise to come."

"No. But I looked all the same, day after day. What were you so busy
about?"

"Oh, I don't know. I thought--that perhaps it wasn't quite--right;"
hesitatingly.

"It will be right now." He pressed the arm closer that had been
slipped in his. Then they were silent, but both understood. There was
something so sweet and true about her, so delicate, yet wise, that
needed no blurting out of any fact, for both to take it into their
lives.

"And who was there to-night?" asked her mother, with a little fear.
For Mrs. Forbes would hardly know how matters stood between her and
Lieutenant Langdale.

"The Remsens only. And they sing beautifully together. Oh, it was
really charming. Mrs. Remsen asked me to visit her. It's odd, mother,
but do you know my friends have mostly fallen out! So many of the
girls have married, and I seem older than the others. Does a year or
two change one so? I sometimes wonder if I was the eager little girl
who went to Philadelphia, and to whom everything was a delight."

"You are no longer a little girl."

"And at the nutting the other day, I went to please Felix, you know.
But the boys seemed so rough. And though I climbed a tree when they
all insisted, I--I was ashamed;" and her face was scarlet.

Yes, the Little Girl was gone forever.

Her mother kissed her, and she felt now that her child would need no
one to tell her what love was like. For it took root in one's heart,
and sprang up to its hallowed blooming.

It was too soon for confidences. Dilly did not know that she had any
that could be put into words. Only the world looked beautiful and
bright, as if it was spring, instead of winter.

"You've changed again," Felix said observantly. "You're very sweet,
Dilly. Maybe as girls grow older they grow sweeter. I shan't mind your
being an old maid if you stay like this. Dilly, didn't you ever have a
beau? It seems to me no one has come----"

"Oh, you silly child!" She laughed and blushed.

There were sleighing parties and dances. It is odd that in some
communities a girl is so soon dropped out. The dancing parties, rather
rough frolics they were, took in the girls from twelve to sixteen, and
each one strove boldly for a beau. She was not going to be left behind
in the running. But Daffodil Carrick was already left behind, they
thought, though she was asked to the big houses, and the dinners, and
teas at the Fort.

Andsdell dropped in now and then ostensibly to consult Mr. Carrick.
Then he was invited to tea on Sunday night, and to dinner at the
holidays, when he summoned courage to ask Bernard Carrick for his
daughter.

For he had begun a new life truly. The past was buried, and never
would be exhumed. And why should a man's whole life be blighted by a
moment of folly!

They grew brave enough to look at one another in the glowing
firelight, even if the family were about. One evening she stepped out
in the moonlight with him. There was a soft snow on the ground, and
some of the branches were yet jewelled with it. Half the lovers in the
town would have caught a handful of it and rubbed crimson roses on her
cheeks. He said, "Daffodil," and drew her closely in his arms, kissed
the lips that throbbed with bashful joy and tremulous sweetness.

"Dear, I love you. And you--you are mine."

There was a long delicious breath. The story of love is easily told
when both understand the divine language.

She came in glowing, with eyes like stars, and went straight to her
mother, who was sitting alone. Both of the men had gone to some
borough business. She kissed her joyous secret into the waiting heart.

"You love him. You know now what love is? That is the way I loved your
father."

"It is wonderful, isn't it? You grow into it, hardly knowing, and then
it is told without words, though the words come afterward. Oh, did you
think----"

"Foolish child, we all saw. He carried the story in his eyes. Your
father knew. He has been very honest and upright. Oh, my dear, I am so
glad for you. Marriage is the crown of womanhood."

Her mother drew her down in her lap. Daffodil's arms were around her
neck, and they were heart to heart, a happy mother and a happy child.

"You will not mind if I go to bed? I--I want to be alone."

"No, dear. Happy dreams, whether you wake or sleep."
