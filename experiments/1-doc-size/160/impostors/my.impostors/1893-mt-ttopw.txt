decided condition of irritation with each other. Tom was charmed; so
pleased, indeed, that he cautiously did what he could to increase the
irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives.
By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing-point, and he might
have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up, in another moment,
but for the interruption of a knock on the door--an interruption which
fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson opened the door.

The visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, energetic, middle-aged
Irishman named John Buckstone, who was a great politician in a small
way, and always took a large share in public matters of every sort. One
of the town's chief excitements, just now, was over the matter of rum.
There was a strong rum party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone was
training with the rum party, and he had been sent to hunt up the twins
and invite them to attend a mass-meeting of that faction. He delivered
his errand, and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall
over the market-house. Luigi accepted the invitation cordially, Angelo
less cordially, since he disliked crowds, and did not drink the powerful
intoxicants of America. In fact, he was even a teetotaler
sometimes--when it was judicious to be one.

The twins left with Buckstone, and Tom Driscoll joined company with them
uninvited.

In the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting
down the main street, and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum, the
clash of cymbals, the squeaking of a fife or two, and the faint roar of
remote hurrahs. The tail-end of this procession was climbing the
market-house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when
they reached the hall it was full of people, torches, smoke, noise and
enthusiasm. They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone--Tom
Driscoll still following--and were delivered to the chairman in the
midst of a prodigious explosion of welcome. When the noise had moderated
a little, the chair proposed that "our illustrious guests be at once
elected, by complimentary acclamation, to membership in our
ever-glorious organization, the paradise of the free and the perdition
of the slave."

This eloquent discharge opened the flood-gates of enthusiasm again, and
the election was carried with thundering unanimity. Then arose a storm
of cries:

"Wet them down! Wet them down! Give them a drink!"

Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins. Luigi waved his aloft, then
brought it to his lips; but Angelo set his down. There was another storm
of cries:

"What's the matter with the other one?" "What is the blond one going
back on us for?" "Explain! Explain!"

The chairman inquired, and then reported--

"We have made an unfortunate mistake, gentlemen. I find that the Count
Angelo Capello is opposed to our creed--is a teetotaler, in fact, and
was not intending to apply for membership with us. He desires that we
reconsider the vote by which he was elected. What is the pleasure of the
house?"

There was a general burst of laughter, plentifully accented with
whistlings and cat-calls, but the energetic use of the gavel presently
restored something like order. Then a man spoke from the crowd, and said
that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made, it would
not be possible to rectify it at the present meeting. According to the
by-laws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action. He would
not offer a motion, as none was required. He desired to apologize to the
gentleman in the name of the house, and begged to assure him that as far
as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty, his temporary
membership in the order would be made pleasant to him.

This speech was received with great applause, mixed with cries of--

"That's the talk!" "He's a good fellow, anyway, if he is a teetotaler!"
"Drink his health!" "Give him a rouser, and no heeltaps!"

Glasses were handed around, and everybody on the platform drank Angelo's
health, while the house bellowed forth in song:

   For he's a jolly good fel-low,
   For he's a jolly good fel-low,
   For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,--
      Which nobody can deny.

Tom Driscoll drank. It was his second glass, for he had drunk Angelo's
the moment that Angelo had set it down. The two drinks made him very
merry--almost idiotically so--and he began to take a most lively and
prominent part in the proceedings, particularly in the music and
cat-calls and side-remarks.

The chairman was still standing at the front, the twins at his side. The
extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other
suggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll, and just as the chairman began a
speech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to
the audience--

"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you
out a speech."

The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house, and a mighty
burst of laughter followed.

Luigi's southern blood leaped to the boiling-point in a moment under the
sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four
hundred strangers. It was not in the young man's nature to let the
matter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple
of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back
and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over
the footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons
of Liberty.

Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him
when he is not doing any harm; a person who is not sober cannot endure
such an attention at all. The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll
landed in had not a sober bird in it; in fact there was probably not an
entirely sober one in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly and
indignantly flung on to the heads of Sons in the next row, and these
Sons passed him on toward the rear, and then immediately began to pummel
the front-row Sons who had passed him to them. This course was strictly
followed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and
airy flight toward the door; so he left behind him an ever lengthening
wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity. Down
went group after group of torches, and presently above the deafening
clatter of the gavel, roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing
benches, rose the paralyzing cry of "Fire!"

The fighting ceased instantly; the cursing ceased; for one distinctly
defined moment there was a dead hush, a motionless calm, where the
tempest had been; then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and
energy again, and went surging and struggling and swaying, this way and
that, its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and
gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass.

The fire-boys were never on hand so suddenly before; for there was no
distance to go, this time, their quarters being in the rear end of the
market-house. There was an engine company and a hook-and-ladder company.
Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti-rummies,
after the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the
frontier town of the period. Enough anti-rummies were loafing in
quarters to man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes they had
their red shirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in
unofficial costume--and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the
long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade, the
deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which
washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water
was preferable to fire, and still the stampede from the windows
continued, and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the
building was empty; then the fire-boys mounted to the hall and flooded
it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was
there; for a village fire-company does not often get a chance to show
off, and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it. Such
citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious
temperament did not insure against fire; they insured against the
fire-company.

The Shame of Judge Driscoll.

Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear.
