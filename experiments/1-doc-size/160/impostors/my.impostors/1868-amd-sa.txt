"Elsie is ill," she exclaimed, with much concern. " She 
was very feverish and restless all night, and her head 
aches severely this morning. I wanted to have a physi- 
cian, but she would not listen to it, and declares she will 



 

be better presently. I'm so sorry Stuart is away. If any- 
thing should happen to her " 

It was the first time I had ever seen tears in the lovely 
eyes of Mrs. Lawrence, ncd they moved me indescribably. 

" A sudden cold," I said, trying to encourage her. 
* Doubtless she will recover in a few days." 

"I hope so. She was out driving yesterday, and may 
Lave been a little careless; but I never knew her to act in 
tliis manner. She is usually so sweet and gentle; now she 
will not have the slightest thing done for her." 

I thought of Gerald's alarm when he should hear these 
tidings, and was quite disappointed that he did not call 
during the day or evening, 

I sent to inquire after Elsie on the following morning. 
She had improved somewhat, but was not able to leave 
her room. 

Gerald's continued absence filled me with a strange 
foreboding. Even Mrs. Dorrance spoke of it. I sent a 
note to learn the cause ; and to my satisfaction he answered 
in person, by coming to lunch. 

" Gerald, you have been ill ! " Mrs. Dorrance exclaimed, 
as he entered the room, 

He did look unlike the bright, handsome man we were 
used to seeing. Yet I kept silence, for I knew it had an- 
other than a physical cause. 

"Balls, and parties, and dissipations have proved too 
much for me, Bertha," he said, with an attempt at gayety. 
tt I think of going to some quiet country place to recruit." 

She looked grave, and presently said, 

" I hope your fortune will not prove a bane instead of a 
blessing." 

"Nonsense, Bertha!" he replied, sharply. 

It was an effort to keep up the conversation. Perhaps 
I did less than my share, because I was so startled by the 




possible realization of my late fears. He was absent and 
dispirited, but after our return to the library, proposed a 
walk, to which I readily assented. 

"Gerald," I said, after we had gone some distance, "this 
suspense is torture." 

"My dear friend, forgive me. There is no longer any 
blessed suspense for me, and I have grown selfishly ab- 
sorbed in my misery." 

"It is all over then?" I returned, with a gasp, for I 
could see how he suffered. 

" Hope is over, if that is what you mean ; " and he gave 
a sickly smile. " But the rest can end only with life. Syd- 
nie, I wonder if our uncle, in bequeathing his fortune to 
me, unwittingly transferred his own sad inheritance ? I 
have thought of his life continually for the few past days. 
One blighted blossom in early youth, and no golden fruit- 
age for the later years. Is love fatal to us Cliffords ? My 
parents were happy, I believe, but yours soon came to the 
black shadow of a cruel fate." 

In his pause I thought of myself. How strangely we 
were all linked together by suffering! Even Bertha's 
bright prospect had soon been overclouded by death. 

" I think she loves me," he began, with sudden vehe- 
mence. " She could not deny it, though, for some reason, 
she would not confess. I believe no torture could draw it 
from her. Childish, impulsive, and eager as she is, there's 
something so grand and heroic about her that it fairly 
awed me. She never thought of my falling in love and I 
know she was honest there. It's her fashion to be happy, 
and to make others so; and we have gone on for weeks 
in such a simple, familiar manner, that my proposal took 
her quite by surprise. I don't know as I should have found 
the courage if she had not spoken of her return to Laurel- 
wood." 



 

"But what reason does she assign?" I asked^ much 
amazed at his words. 

" She declared a marriage between us impossible, while 
she has nothing to urge against me, my position, or my 
fortune. I can't describe to you her manner, but her an* 
guish rose from some deeper cause than the mere idea of 
giving me pain. I think she was hurt herself, though she 
would not own it. If she did not love me, I would endure 
it all in silence " 

" But I cannot see any reason sufficiently strong to sway 
her in opposition to her own feelings." 

" It's some fancied duty, or an idea of right, that she 
dings to rigidly. All my persuasions could not move her, 
and she refused utterly to see me again. It was only mis- 
ery to us both, she said. But I could not believe her 
decision final, and the next day wrote to her, entreating 
another interview. All in vain, however. What can 
I do?" 

It was a case where I, certainly, was powerless to advise. 
What motive could urge Elsie to so mysterious a course? 
She was no foolish coquette, no finished actress. Indeed, 
her perfect simplicity had attracted me from the first* I 
seemed to be thrown out of my usual course of reasoning 
in every respect, and felt unable to counsel. 

"I need not talk much of my love," he went on, pres* 
ently. " You must know what it has been and what it 
will be to me; but to think of her as suffering drinking 
some bitter draught that should have missed lips so sweet, 
is intolerable. Sycluie, must it be ? " 

"Gerald, Heaven knows that if I could be of any as- 
sistance to you, I would do anything in my power gladly. 
But I, too, seem helpless." 

" You can see her. She has grown strangely fond of 
you. If her decision arises from a cause where change is 
 



 

impossible, I must submit. Women are better judges of 
each other, perhaps." 

" Suppose she shuns me also?" 

" No, that cannot be. At least, she will see you before 
she leaves the city."
