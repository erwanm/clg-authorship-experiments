compelling power of her, he must not think. He lighted 
candles now, and in the ray of them she stole a look at him 
and saw how pale he was and how set his mouth had grown. 
She had not known in the least what sort of a man it was she 
juggled with. He began to seem a very potent force indeed. 
He had taken a candle, and seemed waiting for her. 

" Let me show you your room," he said now. " The bed- 
room there. You mustn't be afraid, though it's the ground 
floor. I shall be out here." 

Celia rose wearily. She was stiff with tiredness,and hermus- 
cles ached. Midway to take the candle from him, she paused 
and stretched her arms to heaven, overcome with the con- 
tradictions of her lot. She was homesick, and yet she had no 
home. She was passionately anxious to be loved — was not 
the vanity Winterbourne had credited her with the obverse 
side of true desire? — and here was a man who, but a minute 
ago, had loved her. She wanted with every fibre of her to be 
approved, and if ever woman had been admired, she had 
been. Yet it did her no good because she had become hate- 
ful to herself. She stood there now looking past him, her 
great eyes widening. 

"The trouble is — "she said. 

" Well," said Lovell, " the trouble is ? " 

The trouble was, her fighting soul was crying, if she had 
made so many veils between her and the truth, should she 
ever see it ? But she put out her hand and took the candle 
from him. 

" Good-night," she said. The door closed behind her and 
Lovell went back to the mantel, put out the candles, and sat 
down in his chair by the window. 

And there he sat all night and thought chiefly, it seemed 



 





to him for no reason, of his ancestor, the soldier, whose life 
had been devoted to a woman — the wife who never left her 
bed, who was beset with peevishness from the reaction of torn 
nerves, and to whom he hastened in every absence from af- 
fairs, as to the perfect mate. That was love fulfilled. But this, 
too, was more than the winning of the woman creature, the 
transcendent bride; it was the challenge of life itself "I 
must keep my head," he kept commanding himself above 
that tumult of the mind. " I must keep my head." But what 
gibes beset him in the darkness. He was paying penalty, as 
he always did in actual life, for the creative nature, the seeing 
eye, the quick comparison, the too responsive nerve. What- 
ever Lovell might accomplish, he was of those who look upon 
life, recoil from it perhaps, suffer horribly with what seems 
at times the disease of it, and recreate it in some form of art. 
All the phantoms that understand how to rend and tear 
thronged upon him ; here, a thousand voices told him, was 
another joke on him out of the unexpectedness of the general 
comedy. He was Time's fool. But a savage conviction had 
been strengthening in him, in this fallow, silent interval, that 
it is of no use to see, or even write, if you cannot also get your 
grip on circumstance, the jade, and whirl her about to be your 
handmaid. The one real stint is to be a man. And again he 
told himself " I must keep my head." 



 



XXXIII 

CELIA was so tired that she slept ail night, waking 
only once, for a minute or two of homesick terror; 
but before the mind could rouse itself really, she 
was off again, and it was the late morning before she woke 
for good. Then care leaped upon her. Grief had her by 
the throat, and she succumbed to that sickness of the mind 
which is the young's own and the old are never likely to feel 
again, the blessed old who have learned " this too will pass." 
But here she was, every nerve on fire and her blood hurry- 
ing to augment the flame. Something had to be done. As 
she dressed she thought intently. Nothing, it seemed, would 
make the place where she found herself in any slight degree 
better save to take herself away. When she went out, Lovell 
was waiting, and the table, fastidiously laid, was ready. He 
turned at once, after their good-morning, to the spirit-lamp, 
and asked her in the tone of the camping chum how she 
liked her eggs. She thought she didn't want any; but when 
she saw him put his in, it seemed to her she did, and he was 
adroitly ready, timing them. 

Then they sat down together, and Celia had no small talk 
afoot. In the glance she stole at him, she saw his night had 
not been the truce between miseries that hers had been. He 
looked jaded. His eyes wore the look of pain. She would 
have been surprised to know how persistently all night he 
had been thinking, not of her, but of the desirability that he 
should not fail. Of his sharp need of her, his sense of out- 
rage at the trick she and fortune together had combined for 
him, he did not dare, now even at the sight of her, to think. 



 





Lovcll had learned that in time of grief you have to husband 
your power for the actual siege ; you have none to spare for 
fusillades. And over and over again, sitting opposite her at 
the table, he thought of the old colonel and his chivalric serv- 
ice. But he did talk a little, about the house, and Hopkins, 
who was a perpetual question-mark, and Celia was grateful to 
him. And then, breakfast being over, he asked her if she 
didn't want to go down the brook path behind the house and 
leave the scene to Mary Manahan. She agreed at once, un- 
derstanding, from his manner and also from her sense of what 
must come, that she was to have her trial there. 

For Celia now had no idea that she was to escape or that 
she wished to. Something had got to be done to reconstruct 
the disorder of her life. Some hidden self was speaking in 
her, some inheritance from her working ancestors who had 
bent themselves to bring comeliness out of disarray. They 
went out together and down the path to the fringing woods, 
small trees on the border, oaks and birches, and within, a 
higher knoll where pines began. These had been thinned 
persistently and with wisdom, so that something great had 
been attained by tall clean-growing trees with space between. 
But Lovell chose the little path down to the singing brook, 
and by its plashy solitude he halted and showed her the seats 
under trees and asked if they should stay. Celia sat down 
and began at once, looking up at him with a serious strained 
face from which consciousness of self and the vanity of 
beauty's challenge had gone utterly. 

" Let 's have it over," she said. 

"What?" he asked. He, too, seated himself, but where 
it would not be easy to see her face. He wanted to give her 
every chance. 

" I have got to tell you," said Celia, " everything about 
me."
