"Good-night, then. Look in on me if you 
leave before I'm up." 

And that is how Gray saw him before he 
sailed stopped at his door, knocked, and, receiving no response, opened and looked in. 
After a few moments silence he understood 
that the "Seed of Death" had sprouted. 



CHAPTEE XIII 



Lying far to the southwest of the battle 
line, only when a strong northwest wind blew 
could Sainte Lesse hear the thudding of cannon beyond the horizon. And once, when the 
northeast wind had blown steadily for a 
week, on the wings of the driving drizzle had 
come a faint but dreadful odour which hung 
among the streets and lanes until the wind 
changed. 

Except for the carillon, nothing louder than 
the call of a cuckoo, the lowing of cattle or 
a goatherd's piping ever broke the summer 
silence in the little town. Birds sang; a 
shallow river rippled; breezes ruffled green 
grain into long, silvery waves across the valley; sunshine fell on quiet streets, on scented 
gardens unsoiled by war, on groves and 









meadows, and on the stone-edged brink of 
brimming pools where washerwomen knelt 
among the wild flowers, splashing amid floating pyramids of snowy suds. 

And into the exquisite peace of this little 
paradise rode John Burley with a thousand 
American mules. 

The town had been warned of this impend 
ing visitation; had watched preparations for 
it during April and May when a corral was 
erected down in a meadow and some huts 
and stables were put up among the groves of 
poplar and sycamore, and a small barracks 
was built to accommodate the negro guardians of the mules and a peloton of gendarmes 
under a fat brigadier. 

Sainte Lesse as yet knew nothing person 
ally of the American mule or of Burley. 
Saine Lesse heard both before it beheld either 
Burley's loud, careless, swaggering voice 
above the hee-haw of his trampling herds: 

"All I ask for is human food, Smith not 
luxuries just food! and that of the com 
monest kind." 

And now an immense volume of noise and 




dust enveloped the main street of Sainte 
Lesse, stilling the quiet noon gossip of the 
town, silencing the birds, awing the town 
dogs so that their impending barking died 
to amazed gurgles drowned in the din of the 
mules. 

Astride a cream-coloured, wall-eyed mule, 
erect in his saddle, talkative, gesticulating, 
good-humoured, famished but gay, rode Burley at the head of the column, his reckless 
grey eyes glancing amiably right and left at 
the good people of Sainte Lesse who clus 
tered silently at their doorways under the 
trees to observe the passing of this noisy, 
unfamiliar procession. 

Mules, dust; mules, dust, and then more 
mules, all enveloped in dust, clattering, ambling, trotting, bucking, shying, kicking, halt 
ing, backing; and here and there an Ameri 
can negro cracking a long snake whip with 
strange, aboriginal ejaculations; and three 
white men in khaki riding beside the 
trampling column, smoking cigarettes. 

"Sticky" Smith and "Kid" Glenn rode 
mules on the column's flank; Burley continued 









to lead on his wall-eyed animal, preceded now 
by the fat brigadier of the gendarmerie, upon 
whom he had bestowed a cigarette. 

Burley, talking all the while from his saddle to whoever cared to listen, or to himself 
if nobody cared to listen, rode on in the van 
under the ancient bell-tower of Sainte Lesse, 
where a slim, dark-eyed girl looked up at 
him as he passed, a faint smile hovering on 
her lips. 

"Bong jour, Mademoiselle," continued Burley, saluting her en passant with two fingers 
at the vizor of his khaki cap, as he had seen 
British officers salute. "I compliment you on 
your silent but eloquent welcome to me, my 
comrades, my coons, and my mules. Your 
charming though slightly melancholy smile 
bids us indeed welcome to your fair city. I 
thank you; I thank all the inhabitants for 
this unprecedented ovation. Doubtless a municipal banquet awaits us 

Sticky Smith spurred up. 

"Did you see the inn?" he asked. "There 
it is, to the right." 

"It looks good to me," said Burley. 






"Everything looks good to me except these 
accursed mules. Thank God, that seems to 
be the corral down in the meadow there, 
Brigadeer I" 

The fat brigadier drew bridle; Burley burst 
into French: 

"Esker esker " 

"Oui" nodded the brigadier, "that is where 
we are going." 

"Bong!" exclaimed Burley with satisfaction; and, turning to Sticky Smith: "Stick, 
tell the coons to hustle. We're there!" 

Then, above the trampling, whip-cracking, 
and shouting of the negroes, from somewhere 
high in the blue sky overhead, out of limpid, 
cloudless heights floated a single bell-note, 
then another, another, others exquisitely
