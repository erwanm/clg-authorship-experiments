New World we have not quite turned out to be; but 
once I met an Englishman who had lived in Canada, 
and who, gentleman-bred as he was, looked back with 
fond homesickness to the woods where he had taken 
tip land, and built himself a personable house, chiefly 
with his own hands. He had lived himself out of 
touch with his old English life in that new country, 
and had drawn breath in an opener and livelier air 
which filled his lungs as the home atmosphere never 



could again.

Yet he was standing stiffly up for himself, and strew- 
ing his convictions and opinions broadcast as the Eng- 
lish all do when pressed by circumstance, while we, 
with none of their shyness, mostly think our thoughts 
to ourselves. I suppose we do it because we like better 
than they to seem of one effect with the rest of our 
kind. In England one sees a variety of dress in men 
which one rarely sees at home. They dress there not 
only in keeping with their work and their play, but in 
the indulgence of any freak of personal fancy, so that 
in the street of a provincial town, like Bath, for in- 
stance, you will encounter in a short walk a greater 
range of trousers, leggings, caps, hats, coats, jackets, 
collars, scarfs, boots and shoes, of tan and black, than 
you would meet at home in a month of Sundays. The 
differences do not go to the length of fashions, such as 
reduce our differences to uniformity, and clothe, say, 
our legs in knickerbockers till it is found everybody is 
wearing them, when immediately nobody wears them. 
Only ladies, of fashions beyond men's, gratify caprices 
like ours, and even these perhaps not voluntarily. In 
the obedience they show to the rule that they must 
never wear the same dinner or ball gown twice, it was 
said (but who can ever find out the truth of such 
things ?) that they sometimes had sent home from the 
dressmaker's a number of dresses on liking, and wore 
them in succession, only to return them, all but one at 
least, as not liked, the dressmaker having found her ac- 
count in her work being shown in society. 

I do not know just what is to be inferred from a 
social fact or statement like this, but I may say that 
the devotion to an ideal of social position is far deeper 


with the English than with us. Whether we spend more 
or not, I believe that the English live much nearer their 
incomes than Americans do. I think that we save more 
out of our earnings than they out of theirs, and that in 
this we are more like the Continental peoples, the French 
or the Italians. They spend vastly more on state than 
we do, because, for one thing, they have more state to 
spend on. A man may continue to make money in 
America, and not change his manner of living till he 
chooses, and he may never change it. Such a thing 
could not happen to an Englishwoman as happened to 
the elderly American housewife who walked through 
the magnificent house which her husband had bought 
to surprise her, and sighed out at last, " Well, now I 
suppose I shall have to keep a girl!" The girl would 
have been kept from the beginning of her husband's 
prosperity, and multiplied, till the house was full of 
servants. If you have the means of a gentleman in 
England, you must live like a gentleman, apparently; 
you cannot live plainly, and put by, and largely you 
must trust to your life-insurance as the fortune you 
will leave your heirs. It cannot be denied that the 
more generous expenditure of the English adds to the 
grUce of life, and that they are more hospitable accord- 
ing to their means than we are; or than those Conti- 
nental peoples who are not hospitable at all. 

A thing that one feels more and more irritatingly in 
England is that, while with other foreigners we stand 
on common ground, where we may be as unlike them as 
we choose, with the English we always stand on Eng- 
lish ground, where we can differ only at our peril, and 
to our disadvantage. A person speaking English and 
bearing an English name, had better be English, for 
if he cannot it shows, it proves, that there is something 

wrong in him. Our misfortune is that our tradition, 

 

and perhaps our inclination, obliges us to be un-Eng- 
lish, whereas we do not trouble ourselves to be un- 
French, or un-Italian, for we are so by nature. The 
effort involved in distinguishing ourselves breeds a sort 
of annoyance, or call it no more than uneasiness, which 
is almost as bad as a bad conscience; and in our sense 
of hopeless perdition we turn vindictively upon our 
judge. But that is not fair and it is not wise; he does 
not mean to be our judge, except when he comes to 
us for the purpose; in his own house, he is civilly un- 
aware of putting us to any test whatever. If you ask 
him whether he likes this thing or that of ours, he will 
tell you frankly; he never can see why he should not 
be frank ; he has a kind of helplessness in always speak- 
ing the truth ; and he does not try to make it palatable.

An English Radical, who would say of his King no 
more than that he was a good little man, and most use- 
ful in promoting friendship with France, was inclined 
to blame us because we did not stay by at the time of 
our Revolution, and help them fight out as Englishmen 
the fight for English freedom. He had none of the 
loyalty of sentiment which so mystifies the American, 
but plenty of the loyalty of reason, and expected a 
Utopia which should not be of political but of econom- 
ical cast. But one was always coming upon illustra- 
tions of the loyalty of sentiment with which of course 
one could have no quarrel, for their patriotism seldom 
concerned us, except rather handsomely to include us. 
The French have ceased to be the hereditary enemy, 
and the Russians have now taken their place in the 
popular patriotism. I always talked with the lower 

 

classes when I could, perhaps because I felt myself 
near them in my unworthy way, and one evening in 
a grassy lane I made the acquaintance of a friendly 
man letting his horse browse the wayside turf. He 
was in the livery-stable line, but he had been a soldier 
many years. Upon this episode he became freely auto- 
biographical, especially concerning his service in India. 
He volunteered the declaration that he had had enough 
of war, but he added, thoughtfully, " I should like to 
go out for a couple of years if there was any trouble 
with Russia." 

The love of England comes out charmingly in the 
swarming of English tourists in every part of their 
country. Americans may sometimes outnumber them 
at the Continental shrines, but we are in a pitiful mi- 
nority at the memorable places in England ; in fact, we 
are nowhere beside the natives. I liked their fondness 
for their own so much that I never could feel the fine 
scorn for " trippers " which I believe all persons of 
condition ought to assume. Even when the trippers 
did not seem very intelligently interested in what they
