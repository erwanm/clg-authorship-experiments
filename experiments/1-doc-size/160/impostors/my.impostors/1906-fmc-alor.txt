After all, it was but to wait one day more, and that would be the
fourth, and the draft could still reach Palermo in time.




CHAPTER XIX


On the following morning Castiglione’s orderly had a severe shock.
The Captain had been in the saddle early, and hard at work, and
as it had rained heavily on the previous day and night, he and
his charger had come in looking as if they had taken a mud-bath
together. If Castiglione had known Greek, he might have thought
of Hector declining Hecuba’s invitation to go up and pray at the
temple of Zeus, on the ground that he was not fit to be seen. The
orderly was doing what he could for boots and breeches when the
bell rang. He opened the door and beheld an old Capuchin monk
whose gaunt head towered far above his own. But this was not
what surprised him, for mendicant brothers and nuns of various
charitable Orders came at intervals to ask for alms at every
landing of the apartment house. When Castiglione was in, he
gave them a few pennies; his chum rarely gave anything. To-day
Castiglione was at home and his friend was out; this meant pennies.

‘I will ask the Captain,’ said the trooper civilly, leaving the
door open and turning to go into the sitting-room.

Then came the shock.

‘Excuse me, but I wish to see the Conte del Castiglione on private
business,’ said the monk. ‘Be good enough to give him my card.’

Now the trooper was a young man who came of decent people in
Umbria, and had been brought up in the fear of God, and went to
hear a mass now and then on a Sunday when he had time. But the
idea that a bare-footed friar could ever, under any conceivable
circumstances, have private business with an officer of the
Piedmont Lancers had never presented itself to him. He stood
staring at the card like an idiot.

‘That is my name,’ the monk said impatiently. ‘Padre Bonaventura of
the Capuchins.’

‘I can read,’ answered the orderly, offended.

‘But apparently,’ retorted the monk, ‘you cannot walk. Now take
my card to the Captain, and say that I must see him on private
business of the utmost importance to him, and at once. Right about
face, march!’

The order was delivered in such a commanding tone, and with such
a military air, that the trooper obeyed mechanically, swung round
on his heels, and tramped into the sitting-room with the card and
the message, shutting the door behind him. When he reappeared a
moment later, he left it open, stood at attention while the monk
went in, and then shut it after him. He returned to his master’s
boots fully resolved to play at the public lottery with the numbers
corresponding to ‘Capuchin,’ ‘officer,’ and ‘surprise’ in the Book
of Dreams, which contains the correct numbers for everything under
the sun except winning.

The sunshine was streaming into the sitting-room when Padre
Bonaventura entered, and Castiglione stood near the door to
receive him, in slippers and a brown dressing-gown of nearly the
same colour as his visitor’s frock.

‘As your business is urgent, Father, you will excuse my
appearance,’ he said politely, but with distinct coldness, for he
was almost as much surprised as his orderly had been. ‘May I ask
what brings you to see me?’

Padre Bonaventura looked round the room, and then at Castiglione.

‘Shall we be interrupted here?’ he inquired. ‘My errand is very
private.’

Castiglione’s bright blue eyes scrutinised the monk’s great head
and eagle features. Being tolerably satisfied that the man was a
genuine Capuchin and not a disguised thief, he opened the door and
called to his orderly.

‘Let no one come in,’ he said, and he came back at once.

The two sat down on straight chairs by a table and looked at each
other.

‘I come to you on behalf of a Roman lady,’ the monk began.

‘A lady!’

Castiglione moved and his face hardened at once. He thought he had
been mistaken after all, and that his visitor was some scoundrel in
disguise, whom he should presently throw downstairs or hand over to
the police.

‘I do not know her name,’ continued Padre Bonaventura with perfect
calm. ‘She only told me yours yesterday. She has been to confess to
me three times since last May. She is in great danger and you must
help her.’

A romantic foreigner might have scented some strange mystery of
the imaginary Italian life described by English poets. Castiglione,
who knew his own country well, only suspected that a fraud was
being attempted, with a view to extracting money from him; or else
that the monk was the ignoble emissary of some one of the fair and
free who live between two worlds and feed the altar of Ashtaroth
with human sacrifice.

‘Unless you can be more explicit,’ he said coldly, ‘I shall not
listen to any more of this.’

An angry light came into the old Capuchin’s deep-set eyes, for he
understood what Castiglione was thinking. But he checked the retort
and told the facts quickly.

‘The lady has seven letters written to her by you during last April
and May.’

The soldier’s manner changed instantly.

‘Have you come from her to bring them back to me, Father?’ he asked
sadly.

‘No. They were stolen by a steward, photographed, and returned. The
man has absconded, and he, or his accomplices, demand a hundred and
fifty thousand francs; if the money is not paid in four days, the
letters will be published here and in Naples.’

‘Not if I am alive,’ said Castiglione, whose face was not good to
see just then, though he sat quite quietly in his chair.

Padre Bonaventura was so much pleased with this answer that he
actually smiled. It was rather a grim performance of its kind, but
it was unmistakably meant to express satisfaction. The Captain had
turned out to be the sort of man he had hoped to find.

‘May I say a few words more?’ he asked.

‘Certainly. I must have more details. Does her husband know of
this?’

The Capuchin told him the story as he had heard it from Maria’s
lips, omitting nothing. He had an extremely good memory.
Castiglione noted the names to which the drafts were to be
addressed. Padre Bonaventura pointed out that it would be worse
than useless to pay the money for reproductions which could be
multiplied and used to extort more.

‘Is that all, Father?’ asked Castiglione.

‘I have a word to say, Captain,’ returned the monk, ‘first as
one man to another, and then as a priest. So far as the one is
concerned we shall agree, for you are evidently a man of honour; as
for the rest, I presume your views about priests are those of most
young military men.’

‘They are,’ Castiglione admitted.
