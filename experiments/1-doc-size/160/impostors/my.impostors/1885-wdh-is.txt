loveliest and wisest head in the world." 



 

" Oh, do you really think so ? I would give any- 
thing if you did." 

"What?" 

"Think I was pretty," she pleaded, with full eyes. 
"Do you?" 

" No, but I think you are wise. Fifty per cent, of 
truth — it 's a large average in compliments. What 
are you going to wear ? " 

" Wear ? Oh ! At the ball ! Something Egyp- 
tian, I suppose. It 's to be an Egyptian ball. Didn't 
you understand that ? " 

" Oh yes. But I supposed you could go in any 
sort of dress." 

" You can't. You must go in some Egyptian char- 
acter." 

" How would Moses do ? In the bulrushes, you 
know. You could be Pharaoh's daughter, and re- 
cognise me by my three hats. And toward the end 
of the evening, when I became very much bored, I 
could go round killing Egyptians." 

"No, no. Be serious. Though I like you to joke, 
too. I shall always want you to joke. Shall you, 
always ? " 

" There may be emergencies when I shall fail — 
like family prayers, and grace before meat, and 
dangerous sickness." 

"Why, of course. But I mean when we're to- 
gether, and there 's no reason why you shouldn't ? " 

" Oh, at such times I shall certainly joke." 

" And before people, too ! I won't have them 
saying that it 's sobered you — that you used to be 



 

very gay, and now you 're cross, and never say any- 
thing." 

" I will try to keep it uj) sufficiently to meet the 
public demand." 

" And I shall want you to joke me, too. You must 
satirise me. It does more to show me my faults than 
anything else, and it will show other people how per- 
fectly submissive I am, and how I think everything 
you do is just right." 

" If I were to beat you a little in company, don't 
you think it would serve the same purpose ? " 

" No, no ; be serious." 

" About joking ? " 

" No, about me. I know that I 'm very intense, 
'and you must try to correct that tendency in me." 

" I will, with pleasure. Which of my tendencies 
are you going to correct ? " 

" You have none." 

" Well, then, neither have you. I 'm not going 
to be outdone in civilities." 

" Oh, if people could only hear you talk in this 
light way, and then know what I know ! " 

Colville broke out into a laugh at the deep sigh 
which accompanied these words. As a whole, the 
thing was grotesque and terrible to him, but after a 
habit of his, he was finding a strange pleasure in its 
details. 

"No, no," she pleaded. "Don't laugh. There 
are girls that would give their eyes for it." 

"As pretty eyes as yours ? " 

" Do you think they 're nice i " 



 

" Yes, if they were not so mysterious." 

" Mysterious ? " 

"Yes, I feel that your eyes can't really, be as 
honest as they look. That was what puzzled me 
about them the fii-st night I saw you." 

" No— (lid it, really ? " 

" I went home saying to myself that no girl could 
be so sincere as that Miss Graham seemed." 

" Did you say that ? " 

" Words to that effect." 

" And what do you think now ? " 

"Ah, I don't know. You had better go as the 
Sphinx." 

Imogene laughed in simple gaiety of heart. 
" How far wc 've got from the ball ! " she said, as if 
the remote excursion were a triumph. " What 
shall we really go as ? " 

" Isis and Osiris." 

" Weren't they gods of some kind ? " 

" Little one-horse deities — not very much." 

" It won't do to go as gods of any kind. They 're 
always failures. People expect too much of 
them." 

" Yes," said Colville. " That 's human nature 
under all circumstances. But why go to an Egyp- 
tian ball at all ? " 

" Oh, we vncst go. If we both stayed away it 
would make talk at once, and my object is to keep 
people in the dark till the very last moment. Of 
course it's unfortunate your having told Mrs. 
Amsden that you were going away, and then telling 



 

her just after you came back with me that you were 
going to stay. But it can't be helped now. And I 
don't really care for it. But don't you see why I 
want you to go to all these things ? "
