"I never knew any," responded Fenton.
"Do you care to know them?"
"If they are reasons," Fenton rejoined impudently, "it would be
unreasonable not to care."
"Very true," said Mr. Murray smiling. "I will begin with the lesser of
the two. It is found in the nature of man, Fenton. Man is so
constituted that he cannot, year in and year out, stand a seven days'
strain. Neither brain nor muscle will bear it. That has been tested and
proved. In the long run, man cannot do as much working seven days, as he
can do working only six days."
Fenton knew that what his uncle gave as a fact was likely to be a fact;
he had no answer ready at first. Then he said, "I spoke of fishing, sir;
that is play, not work."
"As you do it, I suppose it is. But we are talking of the fact of one
day in seven being set apart from the rest, and the reasons. You see one
reason."
"What's the other?"
"The other is still more difficult to deal with. It consists in
this--that God says the day is His. As Ruler and King of the world, He
lays His hand upon that seventh day and says, This is mine."
"I don't see any reason in that," said Fenton.
"No. But you see the claim and the command. Those must be met, or
disobeyed at our peril."
"What's the use?"
"One great use is, to remember and acknowledge that God is Ruler and
Owner of all. So when we cross the boundary between Saturday and Sunday,
we step over on ground that is not ours."
"There is no good in being stiff and pokey," said Fenton.
"No. It is only a stranger on the ground who can be that. One who knows
the Lord and loves Him is specially at home and free on the Lord's day."
"But I thought the Jewish Sabbath was done away?" said Flora.
"The formal Jewish Sabbath. But not the spiritual. If you study the
matter, you will see that Christ made careful exceptions to the literal
rule in only three cases--where mercy, or necessity, or God's service
demand that it shall be broken."
"Don't you think a farmer ought to get in his hay on Sunday, sir, if he
saw a storm coming up?" Fenton asked.
"I dare not make any other exceptions than the Lord made," his uncle
answered.
"Don't you think trains ought to run on Sunday, Mr. Murray?" said Flora.
"I must say the same thing to you, Miss Flora."
"But in cases of sickness and accident, sir?"
"Have you the notion that Sunday trains are filled with persons who have
been summoned somewhere by telegraph?"
"No--but there are such cases."
"Yes; well. Do you think, honestly, that thousands of people ought to
break the Lord's rule every Sunday, in order to give relief here and
there to the anxiety of one?"
"I can tell you," Fenton broke out, "your doctrine is furiously
unfashionable. There is not a fellow in our school that doesn't do as he
has a mind to on Sunday."
"Other days too, I suppose."
"Of course."
"That is just what, in your sense, a Christian gives up; not on Sunday
more than on other days. That is the difference between a Christian and
another man; one does his own will and the other the will of God, which
is also his own."
Fenton muttered something to Esther, who sat next him, about an "old
foggy," but the subject of conversation was carried no further. Mr.
Murray purposely changed it, and the evening passed in very pleasant
talk, alternating with some Bible reading. Only, towards the close of
the evening Fenton started the question, "where they would go the next
day?"
"Suppose we leave that for Monday to take care of," Mr. Murray answered.
"But, sir, there might be some arrangements to make."
"To-night?"
"Perhaps; but at any rate I might want to give some orders in the
morning."
"I don't think we should have a good time, if we consulted about it
now."
"Why not, sir?"
"You forget. It is the Lord's time. And if we want Him to give us His
favour on our expedition, it seems to me we had better not offend Him
about it beforehand."
"But, sir!"----
"But, Mr. Murray!" put in Flora. "Just to speak about things?"
"Time enough to-morrow, Miss Flora. And this is the Lord's time, you
know."
"But just talking--not doing anything?"
"Doing a good deal in imagination. What's the difference? Study the
fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, the last two verses. Sir Matthew Hale
gave it as his testimony, that he found business concocted on Sunday did
not run off well in the week. No, we will leave the question till
to-morrow at breakfast, if you please."
"I can't understand it!" said Flora, as she went upstairs.
"Study those verses in Isaiah," said Meredith, who overheard her.
CHAPTER XVIII.
A bright little party gathered round the breakfast table Monday morning.
"Now, Uncle Eden," cried Maggie, "where shall we go to-day? It is Monday
now."
"What is proposed?"
Several plans were ready.
"Down in the cove of the bay," said Fenton, "where the lower brook comes
in--then I can fish off Old Woman's rock till lunch is ready."
"I propose the Indian falls," said Esther. "Flora and Meredith have
never seen them."
"I say, Fort Montgomery," said Maggie.
"Fort Montgomery!" There was a general exclamation.
"Where is that?" Meredith asked.
"Seven miles down the river. Oh it is just lovely!" Maggie explained.
"We go down with the tide and come back with the tide, and spend the day
down on the hill there, opposite Anthony's Nose. I showed you from the
front door which Anthony's Nose is, Ditto."
"That would be delightful. The day is going to be perfectly quiet and
warm and sunny--just the thing."
"Seven miles," Fenton grunted. "Who's going to do the rowing?"
"I," said Meredith.
"And I," said Mr. Murray.
"And we can take Fairbairn," said Maggie; "and we had better, for there
will be the baskets to carry."
"Nonsense--I can carry baskets," said Meredith; "and get wood, and all
that."
"I think we can do without Fairbairn," said Mr. Murray. "I like the
plan. It is just the day for it. If it only turn out to be just the time
of tide also!"--
"We'll soon see about that," cried the boys. There was a rush and a
whoop and a race to the boat-house, and then a more leisurely return.
"It's all right," said Meredith. "Couldn't be better. It is half-past
eight now, and the tide just beginning to turn. It will be running down
till two o'clock--and just give us a nice current home."
"And a good pull, too," said Ponton.
"That's all right, old boy. Come! don't you pull backwards. Now, how
soon can we be ready?"
"Just as soon as we can get our lunch ready, and the things," said
Maggie. "You might pack the things, Ditto, and get them into the boat,
while we see about lunch."
"What are 'things'?"
"Why, cups and saucers, and tea-kettle, and matches and plates, and
paper to light the fire, and everything, you know."
"Go off," said Mr. Murray, "and see about victualling the ship. I can
manage the cups and saucers."
So Maggie and Esther ran to consult Betsey, who now held a nondescript
position of usefulness in the family, and was acting cook while Mrs.
Candlish was away--cook proper being absent on leave.
"O Betsey! we are going out, to be gone all day; and now, what can we
have for lunch?"
"Lunch, Miss Maggie!"--
"Yes, and you know we want a good deal. There are six of us."
"You know, it's Monday."
"Well, what of it?"
"There h'aint so much as if t'was any other day. You see, yesterday it
was Sunday."
"Oh well! what have we got, Betsey? I know you have got something."
"There's bread, Miss h'Esther."
"We want more than bread. And butter, and tea and coffee and all that.
We must have something more, Betsey. What have you got?"
"The chickens is nothing left of 'em; and that 'am bone h'aint got much
on it. I do think, Miss Maggie, ye consume a great deal in the woods!"
"Of course we do. And we want a good, hearty lunch to-day, because the
boys and Uncle Eden will have a long way to row. Come, Betsey, make
haste."
"There h'aint a living thing in the 'ouse, but h'oysters, and h'eggs,
and potatoes. That is, nothing cooked. And ye want dressed meat."
"Oysters?" said Maggie doubtfully.
"Capital," said Esther. "And sweet potatoes. We can bake them in the
ashes. And eggs are good. Meredith will make us another friar's omelet."
"There's nothing else for ye," said Betsey, summing up.
So Fairbairn carried a great bag of oysters down to the boat, and a
basket with the potatoes and eggs, and the kettle, and a pail to fetch
water in. And into other baskets went everything else that everybody
