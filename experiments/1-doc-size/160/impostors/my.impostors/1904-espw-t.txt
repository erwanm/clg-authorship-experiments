thoress," observed Steele. 

" I am not an authoress/' flashed Miriam, 
"and no reading man ever uses that word, 
Dr. Steele. Let me have my proof-sheet, if 
you please." 

" Oh, forgive me ! " cried Steele. " I am 
always saying or doing the wrong thing." 

" And I am always forgiving you," she 
answered in an unsteady voice. 

Steele read the verses. There were but two, 
and they ran like this : 

SONG 

To the spaces between the stars 
We went, my love and I, 
Among the uttermost things. 
For my love hath wings; 
With twain he covers his face, 
With twain his feet, 
With twain he doth fly. 

To the earth and our rose-red door, 

We came, my love and I. 

Among the dear, daily things, 

He folded his wings. 

But the winged watch their time. 

And when he starts, 

Ah, how shall I fly ? 



 

He returned the proof-sheet to her. " I 
don't understand it," he said perplexedly. 
" It is graceful, but I don't think I know 
what you mean." 

Miriam put the verses back in her pocket. 

" Now your taste for painting," began Dr. 
Steele, " that appeals to me. I have never 
lost my interest in art. There are so many 
things that a man does lose, you know. I 
hope you have not given up whatever you 
were doing at the school? I like to think of 
you in that peaceful and aesthetic place." 

" I have not been there this summer," said 
Miriam, in a constrained tone. 

" Why not ? " 

Miriam made no reply. Her attraction for 
Dr. Steele had now reached a stage where she 
was conscious of wishing to harmonize with 
him in everything, and uncomfortable when 
she might not. She could not have explained 
to herself why it was that she often found it 
impossible to give him a confidence which she 
longed to offer. His presence brought her 
pleasure, but not peace. He came often ; the 
summer passed dreamily ; and she slowly be- 
gan to admit to herself — but not as yet to 



 

him — that he was becoming necessary to her. 
As the doctor's visits increased in frequency, 
those of the lawyer diminished. Miriam, who 
had been often beloved, had never counted 
Philip Surbridge among her suitors, and when 
she found that she missed him, felt quite at 
liberty to tell him so. 

Dear Philip [she wrote one day] : Aunt 
Cornelia is playing Mariana in the Moated 
Grange for your sweet sake. I mind it a little 
myself, that you stay away. 

Yours faithfully, 

Miriam Lauriat. 

Surbridge responded to this recall, but lei- 
surely, and it was the second week in Septem- 
ber before he came out to dme and spend the 
evening. Miriam was unaffectedly and heartily 
glad to see him. He took her out to row, for 
there was a rowing moon, and she sat in the 
stern, in her white boating dress, with her 
hands clasped behind her head, and looked at 
him affectionately. 

He rowed well, and she thought how square 
his shoulders were, and how sturdy his arm — 
for so studious a man. The values of his face 



 

in the strong, soft light were like those of a 
Reynolds portrait, which had the repose of an 
earlier, calmer age than ours. His very pre- 
sence quieted her ; it always had. Did he 
soothe most people in the same way? She 
sometimes asked herself the question. She 
was conscious of that old impulse to tell things 
to Philip Surbridge. It was not only that he 
belonged to one of the confessional profes- 
sions ; but he had the confessor's temperament. 

As he rowed her out from the shore she 
regarded him wistfully. There were no other 
boats about them, and they seemed to be quite 
alone with the sea and the sky. She thought 
of that other moon-bright night when she and 
Steele had stood upon the shore. But she and 
Surbridge were going straight out to sea. 

"It is the same sea, the same sky, the same 
moon," thought Miriam, " but it 's not the 
same woman." 

They talked little and lightly, with long 
silences between their quiet words. She felt 
a distinct relief from the mental turmoil of 
the summer. For this one hour it was not per- 
emptory to decide anything, and she was 
conscious of a sense of reprieve. 



 

Philip's boyish smile in itself was a comfort 
to her, as it always was, and his dark, mute 
eyes seemed to protect her from herself. He 
did not urge her confidence ; indeed, she was 
half aware that he fended it off. 

To Miriam, as to all high-minded girls, love
