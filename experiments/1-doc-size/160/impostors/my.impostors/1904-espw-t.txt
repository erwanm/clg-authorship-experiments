people rose to their strong feet, and — not 
knowing and not caring that it was against 
court rules to do so — cheered and roared 
like the lion that they are for Dan and 
Trixy. 



CHAPTER XIV 

The vivisector turned painfully upon his bed ; 
he had lain there now six weeks. He had 
always been a well man, and by the mystery 
of physical suffering and disability he was as 
much astonished as he was infuriated. For 
the last twelve months he had worked with a 
concentration never exceeded in his studious 
life. His laboratory had not listened in vain 
for his expected feet, and the lights in its win- 
dows had often burned late into the night. 
During the year his colleagues had noted 
that he had shifted his research away from 
the surgical direction. Whether he had been 
moved to do this through one of those delu- 
sions by which we excuse to ourselves our 
forsworn resolves, he himself could not have 
told. At all events, the work upon which he 
was now engaged — that of serum inoculation 
— was alleged to be the more merciful form 
of experimentation. 

He had not spoken to Miriam Lauriat since 



 

that morning when he was exiled from the 
paradise of her presence. He had written to 
her several times, but had received no replies. 
Beyond a passing glimpse of her in the street, 
or in some place of entertainment, he had not 
seen her face. These instantaneous views, 
caught on the sensitized plate of his conscious- 
ness, had caused him so much misery that he 
had finally withdrawn himself from all but the 
necessary attrition of life. The vow he had 
made to her still reverberated through his be- 
ing, but he excused himself from its fulfillment 
with the easy sophistry of his avocation. It 
was a conditional promise. She had not met 
the condition ; why should he sacrifice himself ? 
At midsummer, about two months ago, he 
came home from his laboratory one day with 
a slight abrasion upon his finger. He thought 
nothing of it at the time. The guinea pig 
that he had inoculated sickened and died, as 
it was intended that it should. On the day 
when the patient creature drew its last miser- 
able breath, Dr. Steele was appalled to dis- 
cover in himself the too familiar symptoms 
of the malady that he had imposed upon his 
timid and unimportant victim. 



 

His knowledge of the nature and conse- 
quences of the disorder constituted its acutest 
feature. He longed for the happy simplicity 
of the layman ; he prayed that certain cells of 
his brain might be dispossessed of their techni- 
cal training ; he would have bartered twenty 
years of education for the dull foresight of a 
man who would know only what his physician 
chose to tell ; he would have sold his brilliant 
reputation for a merciful nescience of his ad- 
vancing fate. 

Steele, as we say, had never been really ill 
before ; we might add that he had never truly 
been alone before. The inevitable solitude of 
sickness — at its best neither tolerated nor un- 
derstood by the well and the gregarious — was 
in his instance rather pitiably uncompanioned. 
His mother was dead ; his brother was in Cali- 
fornia ; and his sister's infrequent visits came 
like ice in April. The attendance of the staff of 
Galen College did not mitigate his desolation, 
any more than it cured his disorder. He was 
alone with his nurse, his servants, and his old 
dog. Tibbs and Barry were about the same 
age, so to speak, and both had well outgrown 
the impatience that youth feels with the sick. 



 

Olin's sister came in on the day of which 
we tell, to make a little duty call. It was with 
evident reluctance that she crossed the sick- 
room. She sat down on a chair at some 
distance from the bed, and prattled her per- 
functory sympathy. 

Did he en j oy the flowers ? Should she send 
another tumbler of that jelly ? Could he read 
some wholesome, cheerful novels? Her hus- 
band sent his kindest regards. Any more let- 
ters from Dick ? How well he was doing at 
the head of that institution ! All her friends 
were proud of him. He was a credit to the 
family, he enjoyed the climate, and said he 
never was so well in his life. 

" I must say, Olin — of course, you know, 
I am very sorry for you, but I should have 
thought you had experience enough not to get 
yourself into such a scrape as this. Still, I sup- 
pose, it 's very interesting studying your own 
symptoms, especially when they are so rare. 
You 'll be writing a pamphlet about it some 
day." 

" Oh, do be still, Jess! " groaned Olin. He 
buried his face in his pillow savagely. 

" Well, I 'm sure ! " exclaimed Jess. " It 's 



 

no use trying to sympathize with you." She 
pouted, and he heard her skirts swishing out 
of the room. 

Agitated by the disturbance of his sister's 
call, Olin flung himself into a rise of tempera- 
ture, and feverishly rang for water and an 
open window. The nurse was off duty, being 
out for her two hours' relief, and Tibbs did 
not hear the bell. Steele called and called 
again, but no one answered him. The sudden 
tears of weakness scalded his eyes. He thought 
of his mother with a boyish, almost a senti- 
mental longing. 

"Nobody cares," he muttered. "I am a 
sick — I am a desolate man." 

His reflections ran a bitter race. He who 
had achieved almost supremely ; he whose 
value science had rated so highly ; he whose
