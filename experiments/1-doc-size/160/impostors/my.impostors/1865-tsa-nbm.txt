while others linger in wasting sickness. Of the day 
and the hour of his departure knows no man." 

Mr. Guy's countenance became even more troubled. 
His eyes, that were very restless, glancing from one ob 
ject to another, continually, had a staring look. 

" Do you believe in a hell, Doctor ? " he said, abrupt- 

iy- 

" Yes," replied the Doctor. 

" Well, I don't, then ! You can't frighten me with 
your fire and brimstone." He grew angry and excited. 
There was a wild play of all the facial muscles ; and a 
fierce gleaming of the eyes. " So don't talk to me about 
hell and damnation ! All stuff and nonsense ! " 

A hand rattled at the door. " Let me open it," said 
the Doctor. " It is your wife." 

" No ! No ! No ! I say NO ! " Guy shouted the 
last utterance of the word " No," with a mad vehe 
mence. " She isn't going to come in here," he added, 
lowering his voice. " D'you know, Doctor," leaning 
closer and speaking in a hushed tone, " that I'm afraid 
of her. She's got designs on my life I'm sure of 
it." 

" Don't, I pray you, entertain so absurd an idea," 
answered the Doctor. 

" There's one thing to be considered," said Guy bright 
ening up, " She hasn't got the new will out of me yet ; 
and I'm safe until that work is done Ha ! Ha ! I'm 
ahead of her, Doctor aint I?" He laughed in a 
low, chuckling way, that chilled the Doctor's blood. 

" This being the case, there is no fear of any harm, 



and so I will admit your wife," replied the Doctor, 
crossing to the door, against the sick man's remonstrance, 
and opening it. As Mrs. Guy, on whose face the Doc 
tor read doubt and questioning suspicion, glided into 
the room, her husband shrunk down, and, turning his 
face to the wall, lay motionless as if asleep. Crossing 
to the bed, she spoke in a kind voice ; but he made no 
response. Two or three times she addressed him ; but 
he still refused to recognize her presence. 

Doctor Hofland retired from the chamber, silently, 
motioning to Mrs. Guy, as he did so. She followed him 
out. 

" It will not do to leave him alone, madam," said the 
Doctor. 

" He's not growing violent, is he ! " Mrs. Guy turn 
ed a little pale. 

" His condition is such, that harm might come of his 
being left to himself. The door was locked when I came. 
Has that occurred before ? " 

"No." 

" It must not occur again." 

As the Doctor said this, Mrs. Gny, who stood near 
the chamber door, which was partly closed, moved for 
ward with a spring. As she did so, it was shut with a 
quick jar, and the key turned on the inside. Her move 
ment was too late. 

The Doctor and Mrs. Guy looked at each other in 
surprise and alarm. Then the former caught at the 
door, and rattled it violently, calling, in a demanding 
tone 

" Mr. Guy ! Mr. Guy ! Open this door ! " 



 

" You can't come in ; so, there's no use in making a 
noise ! " answered Guy resolutely. 

" If you will go down stairs, ma'am,' said the Doc 
tor, " I think he will open the door for me. Where is 
Adam?" 

" At the store." 

" Send for him immediately." 

" I don't think that necessary,'Doctor. And besides, 
Adam is only a boy, and has little influence with his 
father. If you can induce him to open the door, I will 
not leave the room asain." 



" I think you had better send for Adam, ma'am. We 
may need him. There is no telling how violent he may 
become." 

" Then you really think he's losing his mind ? O, 
dear ! " And Mrs. Guy clasped her hands together, 
and put on a look of the deepest distress. 

" We are losing time, ma'am," said the Doctor, in 
an anxious, impatient "way. " Go down stairs, and 
send for Adam." 

The Doctor waited until Mrs. Guy was out of hear 
ing ; then putting his mouth close to the chamber door, 
he called, in a loud whisper, 

" Let me in, Mr Guy ! She's gone down stairs." 

But no answer came. 

" Mr. Guy ! " He repeated the call two or three 
times, but with no better success. 

Listening intently, the Doctor heard the sick man 
movino- about the floor. Then there was a noise like 



the opening of a window. A thrill of fear went through 
his heart. 




[r. Guy ! " He cried loudly, and struck the door 
two or three times with imperative raps. 

" You can't come in," answered Guy, now speaking 
for the first time. 

" Open the door ! I've something very important to 
communicate." 

" What is it ? " The voice sounded nearer, to the
