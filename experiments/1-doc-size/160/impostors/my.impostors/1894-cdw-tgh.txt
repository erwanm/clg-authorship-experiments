when Jack entered, and his first impression was 
that the scream of conversation would be harder to 
talk against than a Wagner opera ; but he presently 
got his cup of tea, and found a snug seat in the 
chimney-corner by Miss Tavish ; indeed, they moved 
to it together, and so got a little out of the babel. 
Jack thought the girl looked even prettier in her 
walking-dress than when he saw her at the studio ; 







she had style, there was no doubt about that; and 
then, while there was no invitation in her manner, 
one felt that she was a woman to whom one could 
easily say things, and who was liable at any moment to say things interesting herself. 

" Is this your first appearance since last night, 
Mr. Delancy?" 

" Oh no; I've been racing about on errands all 
day. It is very restful to sit down by a calm per- 
son." 

"Well, I never shut my eyes till nine o'clock. I 
kept seeing that Spanish woman whirl around and 
contort, and do you mind my telling you? I 
couldn't just help it, I " (leaning forward to Jack) 
" got up and tried it before the glass. There ! Are 
you shocked ?" 

" Not so much shocked as excluded," Jack dared 
to say. " But do you think " 

" Yes, I know. There isn't anything that an 
American girl cannot do. I've made up my mind 
to try it. You'U see." 

"Will I?" 

" No, you won't. Don't flatter yourself. Only 
girls. I don't want men around." 

" Neither do I," said Jack, honestly. 

Miss Tavish laughed. "You are too forward, 
Mr. Delancy. Perhaps some time, when we have 
learned, we will let in a few of you, to look in at the 
door, fifty dollars a ticket, for some charity. I don't 





see why dancing isn't just as good an accomplish, 
ment as playing the harp in a Greek dress." 

" Nor do I ; I'd rather see it. Besides, you've 
got Scripture warrant for dancing off the heads of 
people. And then it is such a sweet way of doing 
a charity. Dancing for the East Side is the best 
thing I have heard yet." 

" You needn't mock. You won't when you find 
out what it costs you." 

" What are you two plotting ?" asked Mrs. Traf- 
ton, coming across to the fire-place. 

" Charity," said Jack, meekly. 

" Your wife was here this morning to get me to 
go and see some of her friends in Hester Street." 

" You went ?" 

" Not to-day. It's awfully interesting, but I've 
been." 

"Edith seems to be devoted to that sort of 
thing," remarked Miss Tavish. 

"Yes," said Jack, slowly, "she's got the idea 
that sympathy is better than money ; she says she 
wants to try to understand other people's lives." 

"Goodness knows, I'd like to understand my 
own." 

" And were you trying, Mr. Delancy, to persuade 
Miss Tavish into that sort of charity ?" 

" Oh dear, no," said Jack ; " I was trying to interest the East End in something, for the benefit of 
Miss Tavish." 





" You'll find that's one of the most expensive re- 
marks you ever made," retorted Miss Tavish, rising 
to go. 

"I wish Lily Tavish would marry," said Mrs. 
Trafton, watching the girl's slender figure as it 
passed through the portiere; "she doesn't know 
what to do with herself." 

Jack shrugged his shoulders. " Yes, she'd be a 
lovely wife for somebody"; and then he added, as 
if reminiscently, " if he could afford it. Good-by." 

" That's just a fashion of talking. I never knew 
a time when so many people afforded to do what 
they wanted to do. But you men are all alike. 
Good-by." 

When Jack reached home it was only a little 
after six o'clock, and as they were not to go out to 
dine till eight, he had a good hour to rest from the 
fatigues of the day, and run over the evening pa- 
pers and dip into the foreign periodicals to catch a 
topic or two for the dinner-table. 

" Yes, sir," said the maid, " Mrs. Delancy came in 
an hour ago." 



CHAPTER IV 

EDITH'S day had been as busy as Jack's, notwith- 
standing she had put aside several things that de- 
manded her attention. She denied herself the morn- 
ing attendance on the Literature Class that was 
raking over the eighteenth century. This week 
Swift was to be arraigned. The last time when 
Edith was present it was Steele. The judgment, on 
the whole, had been favorable, and there had been 
a little stir of tenderness among the bonnets over 
Thackeray's comments on the Christian soldier. It 
seemed to bring him near to them. " Poor Dick 
Steele!" said the essayist. Edith declared afterwards that the large woman who sat next to her, 
Mrs. Jerry Hollowell, whispered to her that she always thought his name was Bessemer; but this 
was, no doubt, a pleasantry. It was a beautiful essay, and so stimulating ! And then there was 
bouillon, and time to look about at the toilets. 
Poor Steele, it would have cheered his life to 
know that a century after his death so many 
beautiful women, so exquisitely dressed, would have 
been concerning themselves about him. The func- 
tion lasted two hours. Edith made a little calcula'
