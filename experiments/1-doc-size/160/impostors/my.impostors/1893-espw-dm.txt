Then it was that he felt his arm seized by 
a mighty grasp. He knew that clutch. Who 
in all Harle could mistake it ? Nobody but 
Trouncey O Grian could grip a man like 
that. 

To say that the Junior crew were paralyzed 
when they saw Marcy disappear would 
be putting it mildly. Were it not for the 
superior weight and buoyancy of their craft 
and their presence of mind when the gust 
struck them abeam, they, too, would have 
gone under. A wild thought swept through 
Trouncey O Grian 's whirling brain. Don 
ald must be saved at any cost ; he would 
be the man to do it. The feat which he 
now performed is yet talked of in Harle 
College. 

" My God, boys ! " came from his sternly- 
set lips. His voice hissed like a musket-ball 
through the storm. "Rest on your oars. 
Balance for your lives ! Steady ! Don't 
mind the water, or you're goners. I've got 
to jump ! " 

He had let his oar drift aside. Dexter- 





ously he had slipped his feet from the straps, 
and without so much as letting a teaspoonful 
of water in the shell, already half-swamped, 
the trained athlete had jumped in the air, 
and landed in the water. 

" O Trouncey ! " gasped Don reproach 
fully. " God bless you ! " he spluttered 
tenderly. 

But Trouncey O Grian said nothing. 
Holding the exhausted boy with his tremen 
dous clasp, he set out mightily for shore. He 
wasted no breath in words. Donald felt that 
they were making headway, but that he 
was very cold ; the blackness settled in be 
tween them and the shore. 

" You can't do it, Trouncey,". he 
muttered ; and then the sky seemed to go out 
utterly, like a quenched lamp. At that 
moment another hand grasped his shoulder. 
The reinforcement of a fresh, unchilled man, 
unexhausted by the exercise of rowing, and 
the better able to bear the shock of the 
water, came bravely up to the relief of the 
two boys. 

It was Lee Calhoun. 

He had learned to swim in Charleston 
harbor, warmer waves than these ; but 
it seemed they trained no colder hearts. 



 

That night, when the captain sat in his 
room, a little pale, a little shivery, coddled 
by Jamie, with a soapstone hot enough to 
burn his shoes, and lemonade that tasted of 
the rust in the bottom of the pan adorning 
the top of the stove ; and when the captain 
was generally " receiving " the Junior crew, 
Trouncey O Grian said, in a lower voice than 
Trouncey was in the habit of using : 

" Don't mention it, Marcy ! Eemember 
you let on Sophomore year, to let me out, 
eh ? I don't come of a good family, I know," 
added honest Trouncey, " but I don't forget 
a thing like that, captain." 

" Ya-as," drawled Lee Calhoun, " I 
thought of that affair myself. I couldn't 
omit it from the curriculum when I saw you 
going down." 

He did not explain himself further. But 
everybody remembered that it was Marcy who 
took the Freshman out of the coffin, not 
many minutes too soon. The three principals 
in that memorable event looked at each 
other with something of the curious tender 
ness of reconciled sections after civil war. 
Donald colored slightly. Trouncey shook his 
big head. But Lee was quiet, self-possessed, 
and cool. It is the delightful thing about 





college friendships, that they easily override 
grudges and trifles, and gather together all 
sorts of sympathies and loyalties, from all 
kinds of natures ; each bound to many by 
that young glow and fervor of feeling which 
adoration for his Alma Mater, and nothing 
else in life, can give a man. 

But Donald was thinking of another 
thing. 

Donald had a sore throat. He was won 
dering what effect this was likely to have 
upon the daily elocutionary drill which he 
practiced for the De Courtney. 

There was but one competitor whom Marcy 
really feared ; his most important rival, 
a fellow by the name of Hallo well, who had 
entered Harle and the Junior class that year. 
Tom Hallowell was four years older than 
Donald ; and a more practiced writer. But 
he was a poorer speaker. Donald depended 
upon his own elocution, perhaps quite as 
much as he was justified in doing. For 
some reason, nobody could tell just why, 
Hallowell was not popular in Harle College. 
For one thing, he had gone too hard and too 
fast into class politics. He was a brilliant, 
black - mustached, self - satisfied fellow, who 
had a vague name for being too shrewd, 



 

what is called " a little tricky," in short, a 
college politician. Yet no misdemeanor had 
ever been clearly proved against him ; and 
Don used to say good-naturedly : 

"What 's the matter with Hallowell? 
He 's all right." 

Donald was on excellent terms with his 
rival. This was considered good form.
