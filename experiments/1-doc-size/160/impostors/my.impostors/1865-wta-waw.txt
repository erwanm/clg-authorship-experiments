"Big heap thigs," added the savage, pointing to the tent filled with
stores and merchandise.

"They are mine," said Noddy.

"Americals--yes."

"What do you want?"

"Big wreck," said the visitor, pointing over to the schooner. "Big lot
mel ol the other islal."

"Americans?" asked Noddy, clearly understanding the speaker, whose
enunciation was principally defective in the substitution of l's for
n's.

"Four Americals; big storm; come in boat."

"Do you hear that, Mollie?" exclaimed Noddy. "He says that four
Americans came to the other island in a boat."

"They must be some of the crew of the Roebuck."

"Big wreck; log time; fild it low," said the savage, pointing to the
schooner again.

They had been looking for the wreck from which the four men had been
saved, but had not been able to find it before.

"Whale ship over there," added he. "Take four mel off."

"Is she there now?" asked Noddy, breathless with interest.

"Go sool--to-morrow--lext week."

This was not very definite; but the way to his native land seemed to be
open to him, and he listened with deep emotion to the welcome
intelligence.

"Can we go over there?" asked Noddy, pointing to his companion.

"Go with we."

"We will."

"Big heap thigs," added the savage, pointing to the storehouse again.
"Walt to trade?"

"Yes; what will you give for the lot?" asked Noddy, facetiously.

"Big heap thigs," replied the man, not comprehending the wholesale
trade.

It was of no use to attempt to bargain with these people; they had no
money, and they could help themselves to what they pleased. Noddy gave
them heavy articles enough to load their boat, for he felt that he had
no further use for them, if there was a whale ship at the other island.
He questioned the savage very closely in regard to the vessel, and was
satisfied that he spoke the truth. The welcome intelligence that a
portion of the Roebuck's crew had been saved, rendered the exiles the
more anxious to visit the island.

The savages all landed and gazed at Mollie with the utmost interest and
curiosity. Probably they had never before seen an American girl. But
they were respectful to her, and she soon ceased to be afraid of them.
She laughed with them, and soon became quite intimate with the whole
party. They treated her like a superior being; and certainly her pretty
face and her gentle manners were quite enough to inspire them with such
an idea.

The savages had loaded their goods into the canoe, and were ready to
return. The man who spoke English offered them a passage in his craft;
but Noddy decided that it would be better and safer for them to go over
in their own boat. He proceeded to secure all his valuables, including
all his own money and that he had saved from the state-room of the
captain, which he concealed about his clothes. The boat was well loaded
with such articles as he thought would be useful to Mollie, or would
sell best when a chance offered. He had quite a cargo, and the savages
began to be impatient before his preparations were completed.

While he was thus employed, Mollie gathered fresh flowers, and paid her
last visit, as she supposed, to the grave of her father. She wept there,
as she thought of leaving him in that far-off, lonely island; but she
was consoled by the belief that her father's spirit dwelt in the happy
land, where spring eternal ever reigns.

The boat was ready; she wiped away her tears, and stepped on board. Both
of them felt sad at the thought of leaving the island; but home had
hopes which reconciled them to the change.




CHAPTER XX.

HOMEWARD BOUND.


Noddy shook out the sail of the boat, and pushing her off, followed the
canoe. Though the exiles had been on the island but little over two
months, they had become much attached to their new home, and it was with
a feeling of sadness that they bade adieu to it. The house and other
improvements had cost Noddy so much hard labor that he was sorry to
leave them before he had received the full benefit of all the comfort
and luxury which they were capable of affording.

"Don't you think we ought to live on the island for a year or so, after
all the work we have done there?" said Noddy, as the boat gathered
headway, and moved away from the shore.

"I'm sure I should be very happy there, if we had to stay," replied
Mollie, "But I don't think I should care to remain just for the sake of
living in the house you built."

"Nor I; but it seems to me just as though I had done all the work for
nothing."

"You worked very hard."

"But I enjoyed my work, for all that."

"And you think you did not win anything by it," added she, with a smile.

"I don't think that. I used to hate to work when I was at Woodville. I
don't think I do hate it now."

"Then you have won something."

"I think I have won a great deal, when I look the matter over. I have
learned a great many things."

Noddy had only a partial appreciation of what he had "won," though he
was satisfied that his labor had not been wasted. He had been happy in
the occupation which the necessities of his situation demanded of him.
Many a boy, wrecked as he had been, with no one but a weak and timid
girl to support him, would have done nothing but repine at his hard lot;
would have lived "from hand to mouth" during those two months, and made
every day a day of misery. Noddy had worked hard; but what had he won?
Was his labor, now that he was to abandon the house, the cisterns, the
stores, and the garden,--was it wasted?

Noddy had won two months of happiness.

He had won a knowledge of his own powers, mental and physical.

He had won a valuable experience in adapting means to ends, which others
might be years in obtaining.

He had won a vast amount of useful information from the stubborn toil he
had performed.

He had won the victory over idleness and indifference, which had beset
him for years.

He had won a cheerful spirit, from the trials and difficulties he had
encountered.

He had won a lively faith in things higher than earth, from the gentle
and loving heart that shared his exile, for whom, rather than for
himself, he had worked.
