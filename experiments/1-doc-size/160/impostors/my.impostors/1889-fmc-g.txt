CHAPTER XII 

As the words escaped Clara's lips, Greifenstein started violently 
and made as though he would rise, laying his hands on the edge of 
the table and leaning forward towards his wife. The echo of 
Rieseneck's name had not died away when the unhappy woman 
realised what she had done. Rieseneck himself turned suddenly 
towards her and the blood rushed to his pale face. Clara's head 
fell forward and she covered her eyes with her hands, uttering a 
short, sharp cry like that of an animal mortally wounded. The 
servant stood still at Rieseneck's side, staring stupidly from one to 
the other. Fully ten seconds elapsed before Greifenstein recovered 
his presence of mind. 

' You are ill, Clara/ he said in a choking voice. ' I will take 
you to your room.' 

He did not understand the situation, and he could not guess 
how his wife had learned that the visitor was not Herr Brandt but 
Kuno von Rieseneck. But he was horrified by the thought that 
she should have made the discovery, and his first idea was to get 
her away as soon as possible. He came to her side, and saw that 
she was helpless, if not insensible. Then he lifted her from her 
chair and carried her through the wide door and the small apart- 
ment beyond into the drawing-room. Rieseneck followed at a 
distance. 

' You can go,' said Greifenstein to the servant. ' We shall not 
want any more dinner to-night.' 

The man went out and left the three together. Clara lay upon 
a great divan, her husband standing at her side, and Rieseneck at 
her feet. Her eyes were open, but they were glassy with terror, 
though she was quite conscious. 

' Clara are you better ? ' asked Greifenstein anxiously. 

She gasped for breath and seemed unable to speak. Greifenstein 
looked at his brother. 



 

' I cannot imagine how she knew your name/ he said. ' Did 
you know her before ? ' 

Rieseneck had turned white again and stood twisting his fingers 
as though in some terrible distress. Greifenstein had not noticed 
his manner before, and gazed at him now in considerable surprise. 
He fancied that Rieseneck feared discovery and danger to himself. 

' What is the matter ? ' he asked impatiently. * You are safe 
enough yet 

While he spoke Clara endeavoured to rise, supporting herself 
upon one hand, and staring wildly at Rieseneck. The presentiment 
of a great unknown evil came upon Greifenstein, and he laid his 
hand heavily upon his brother's arm. 

' What is the meaning of this ? ' he asked sternly. * Do you 
know each other ? ' 

The words roused Rieseneck. He drew back from his brother's 
touch and answered in a broken voice : 

' Let me go. Let me leave this house 

' No ! ' exclaimed the other firmly. ' You shall not go yet.' 

Again he grasped Rieseneck's arm, this time with no intention 
of relinquishing his hold. 

' Let him go, Hugo ! ' gasped Clara. She struggled to her feet 
and tried to unloose the iron grip of her husband's fingers, strain- 
ing her weak hands in the useless attempt. ' Let him go ! ' she 
repeated frantically. ' For God's sake let him go ! ' 

' What is he to you ? ' asked Greifenstein. Then, as though he 
guessed some fearful answer to his question he repeated it in a 
fiercer tone. ' What is he to you ? And what are you to her ? ' he 
cried, facing his brother as he shook him by the arm. 

' You have cause to be angry,' said Rieseneck. ' And so have 
I.' He fixed his eyes on Clara's, and something like a smile 
flitted over his features. 

' Speak ! ' commanded Greifenstein, to whom the suspense was 
becoming unbearable. 

Clara saw that Rieseneck was about to utter the fatal words, 
and with a last remnant of energy she made a desperate attempt 
to cover his mouth with her hand. But she was too late. 

' This woman is my wife, not yours ! ' he cried in ringing tones. 

In an instant Greifenstein thrust his brother from him, so that 
he reeled back against the wall. 

' Liar ! ' he almost yelled. 

Clara fell upon the floor between the two men, a shapeless heap 
of finery. Rieseneck looked his brother in the face and answered 
the insult calmly. From the moment when he had recognised 



 

Clara, he had felt that he must see the whole horror of her fall 
with his own eyes in order to be avenged for his wrongs. 

I told you my wife was dead/ he said slowly. ' I believed it. 
She is alive. She has lived to ruin you as she ruined me. Clara 
von Rieseneck that is your name stand upon your feet lift up 
your infamous face, and own your lawful husband ! ' 

Even then Clara might have saved herself. One vigorous 
protest, and Greifenstein would without doubt have slain his 
brother with his hands. But she had not the strength left to 
speak the strong lie. She dragged herself to her accuser's feet and 
threw her arms about his knees. 

' Mercy ! ' she could not utter any other word. 

'You see,' said Rieseneck. 'She is alive, she knows me !' 

'Mercy!' groaned the wretched creature, fawning upon him 
with her wasted hands. 

' Down, beast ! ' answered the tall old man with savage contempt. 
' There is no mercy for such as you.' 

Greifenstein had stood still for some seconds, overcome by the 
horror of his shame. One glance told him that his brother had 
spoken the truth. He turned away and stood facing the empty 
room. His face was convulsed, his teeth ground upon each other, 
his hands were clenched as in the agony of death. From his 
straining eyes great tears rolled down his grey cheeks, the first 
and the last that he ever shed. And yet by that strange instinct 
of his character which abhorred all manifestation of emotion, he 
stood erect and motionless, as a soldier on parade. The death- 
blow had struck him, but he must die on his feet. 

Then after a long pause, broken only by Clara's incoherent 
groans and sobs, he heard Rieseneck's footstep behind him, and 
then his brother's voice, calling him by his name. 

' Hugo what has this woman deserved V 

' Death,' answered Greifenstein solemnly. 

' She helped to ruin me through my faults, she has ruined you 
through no fault of yours. She must die.' 

' She must die,' repeated Greifenstein. 

' She has given you a son who is nameless. She cast off the
