It was at this inopportune moment that they met 
Mortimer. If Alexina had remembered that this was his 
homing hour she would have parted from her visitor at 
the drawing-room door; but in truth she had dismissed 
Mortimer from her mind. 

He halted some paces off and glared from his wife's 




diaphanous costume to the workman in his rough clothes 
and flannel shirt. As the avenue sloped abruptly he was 
at a disadvantage, and it was all he could do to keep 
from grinding his teeth. 

Alexina went forward and placed her hand within his 
arm, giving it a warning pressure. 

"Now, at last, you and Mr. Kirkpatrick will meet. 
You've always so snubbed our little attempts to understand some of the things that men know all about, that 
you've never met any of our teachers. But no one has 
taught me as much as Mr. Kirkpatrick, so shake hands 
at once and be friends. ' ' 

Mortimer extended a straight and wooden hand. 
Kirkpatrick touched and dropped it as if he feared contamination. Mortimer ascended a few steps and from 
this point of vantage looked down his unmitigated disapproval and contempt. Kirkpatrick would have given 
his hopes of the speedy demise of capitalism if Alexina 
had picked up her periwinkle skirts and fled up the 
avenue. His big hands clenched, he thrust out his pugnacious jaw, his hard little eyes glowed like poisonous 
coals. Mortimer, to do him justice, was entirely without 
physical cowardice, and continued to look like a stage 
lord dismissing a varlet. 

Kirkpatrick caught Alexina 's imploring eyes and 
turned abruptly on his heel. "So long," he said. 
"Guess I'd better be getting on."

"I won't have that fellow in the house," said Mortimer, in a low tone of white fury. "To think that my 

wife — my wife " 

' ' If you don 't mind we won 't talk about it. " 
Alexina was on the opposite side of the avenue and 
her head was in the air. She had long since ceased to 
carry her spine in a tubercular droop and when she 
chose she could draw her body up until it seemed to 
elongate like the neck of a giraffe, and overtop Mortimer or whoever happened to have incurred her wrath. 



 

Mortimer glowered at her. He had many grievances. 
For the moment he forgot that she might have any 
against him. 

"And out here in broad daylight, almost on the street, 
in that tea gown " 

' ' I have often been quite on the street in similar ones. 
Going over to Aileen's. You forget that the Western 
Addition is like a great park set with the homes of 
people more or less intimate." 

Mortimer made no further remarks. He had never 
pretended to be a match for her in words. But the 
agitating incident seemed to have lifted him temporarily 
at least out of the nether depths of his depression, for 
although he talked little at dinner he appeared to eat 
with more relish. As he settled himself to his cigar in a 
comfortable wicker chair on the terrace and she was 
about to return to the house he spoke abruptly in a 
faint firm voice. 

"Will you stay here? I've got something to say to 
you." 

"Oh?" 

She wheeled about. His face was a sickly greenish 
white in the heavy shade of the trees. 

"It's — it's — something I've been' wanting to say — tell 
you ... as well now as any time." 

' ' Oh, very well. I must write just one letter. ' ' 

She ran into the house and up the stairs and shut her- 
self in the library, breathless, panic-stricken. He was 
going to confess ! How awful ! How awful ! How could 
she ever go through with it? Why, why, hadn't she 
spoken at once and got it over? 

She sat quite still until she had ceased trembling and 
her heart no lorger pounded and affected her breathing. 
Then she set her teeth and went downstairs. 



 



CHAPTER XII 



TV/f ORTIMER was walking up and down the hall. 
'* "Come in here," he said. He entered the 
drawing-room, and Alexina followed like a culprit' 
led to the bar. Nevertheless, it crossed her mind that he 
wanted the moral support of a mantelpiece. 

She almost stumhled into a chair. Mortimer did not 
avail himself of the chimneypiece toward which he had 
unconsciously gravitated, but walked back and forth. 
Two electric lights hidden under lamp shades were burning, but the large room was rather somber. 

Alexina composed herself once more with a violent 
effort and asked in a crisp tone : ' ' Well ? What is this 
mystery? Are you in love with some one else? Been 
making love " 

"Alexina!" 

He confronted her with stricken eyes. "You know 
that I am literally incapable of such a thing. But of 
course you were jesting." 

"Of course. But something is so manifestly wrong 
with you, and . . . well ... of course you would be 
justified." 

"Not in my own eyes. Besides, I shall never give up 
the hope of winning you back again. I live for that . . . 
although now ! . . . that is the whole trouble. . . . How 
am I going to say it?" 

""Well, let me help you out. You took the bonds." 

"You've been to the bank! I wanted to tell you first 
. . . the day you came back. ... I couldn't. ..." 

"There is only one thing I am really curious about. 
How did you get in ? Of course you knew where I kept 
the key, but " 

"I " His voice was so lifeless that if dead men 

could speak it must be in the same flat faint tones. 
"I had the old power of attorney."
