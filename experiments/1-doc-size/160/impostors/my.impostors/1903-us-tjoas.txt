It has been another week. I could not stand 
it any more. I am going over to the publishers' 
again this afternoon. 



— What in Heaven's name does this thing 
mean? I met the satisfied smile of the clerk 
again. " We have never seen the manuscript, 
Mr. Stirling! " 

If you could only see how positive she is! 
" I don't know anything about what the editor 
told you, I can only tell you positively that he 
has never submitted any such manuscript to 
the firm, or to anybody connected with the 
firm." 

That thing drove me wild. I don't know 
what to make of it. Surely he's given it to some 
one, for he told me so. 

I went up to the magazine rooms, and he 
was in his office; but he had left word that he 
would not see any one, and they would not even 
take in my name. 

April 4th. 
I can do nothing but haunt that place till I 
find out what it means! It has been three weeks 
and a half since he gave it to them, and he 
said I would hear at once. What  in the world 
does he think it means to me? Can't I pre- 
sume the slightest gleam of interest, of care, 
on his part? 


April 5th. 

To-day I could not stand it any longer. I 
went to the place again. I saw the manuscript 
clerk once more — the same answer. I went up- 
stairs; he was there again, but busy. I wrote a 
note and left it. I explained that I did not in the 
least wish to trouble him, but that the thing 
meant a great deal to me, and that I had the 
utmost need of promptness; that it had been 
almost four weeks since he gave it to the firm, 
and that nobody there seemed to know anything 
about it. 

April 7th. 

He did not answer my letter! I thought I 
should hear to-day. O God, this is the most 
tormenting thing! Think what it means! And 
what in Heaven's name has he done? Surely 
some one — he must have given it to some one! 

Only why in the world doesn't he under- 
stand my perplexity and explain? 

April 9th. 

No letter yet. I went back to the publishers' 

again this morning. I have been wandering by 

the place every day since. They had not seen it 

yet. She said she'd have the firm inquire, but I 



said not to, as it might annoy him. " He surely 
has given it to some one, you know." — She 
laughed at me. 

I went up to the magazine office again. He 
was not there, but I saw his associate. The as- 
sociate did not know anything about it either. 

April loth. 
I waited one day more and no answer. I 
wrote to him again to-night, begging him to 
please reply. 

— I have begun several novels, but I can't get 
interested in them. I am simply sick. I came 
out of that horrible restaurant with money 
enough to do me for ten weeks, and here are 
over five of them gone in this hideous way. Oh, 
it is monstrous! 

It has been nine weeks and 'a half since I gave 
him that poem in the beginning! I never spent 
nine such weeks of horror in my life. 

April 1 2th. 
" In answer to your letter I beg to inform you 
that the manuscript of The Captive is now in 
the hands of the firm, and that you may expect 
a decision in about a week." 



So! It is a relief at any rate to know that 
the thing is all right. I can wait a little better 
now. 

Of course I knew it must be there. A plague 
on that foolish clerk! 

April 14th. 
All the while that I am writing about this 
thing I keep up my courage by thinking what 
it will mean to me. It is something so immense 
that I can hardly realize it. I shall be famous! 
And he really liked it, there can be no doubt 
about that ! He was too busy to talk much, but 
he showed he liked it. 

April 17th. 
Oh my soul, I think this is the most frightful 
thing — is it not simply a nightmare? I have 
been pacing the floor to-night in an agony. 
They have never seen that manuscript! 

I was going by there to-day, and I couldn't 
withstand the temptation; the week was not up, 
but I said: " If I inquire, there's no reason why 
he should know about it." I went in. 

And that terrible clerk — she smiled at me 
still! The more I talked, the more she shook 
her head. " There's no such manuscript ever 



been seen here," she said. I showed her the let- 
ter, and that decided her to go in and see the 
firm. They sent out word that neither they nor 
their readers had ever heard of it, but that they 
would write to the editor at once. 

Oh, I think this is horrible— horrible! And 
then just guess what I did! I couldn't bear the 
agony — I went to the other place, and he wasn't 
there, and so at last I went to his club. 

He wasn't at the club, but they told me where 
he was; and I spent ten cents telephoning him. 
At this place they said he had an engagement to 
be there later, so I spent another ten cents, and 
that time I found him. I told him who I was. 
" The week isn't up yet," I said, " but the firm 
say they have never received the manuscript." 

"So?" he said; his voice sounded hard, I
