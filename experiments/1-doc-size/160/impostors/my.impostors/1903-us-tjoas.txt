I said Yes, and had a palace and a large waist- 
coat too. 

" Then what will you be? " asked the great- 
uncle. 

" I will be a poet," said I. 

" You mean you will be a loafer? " said he. 

" Yes," said I — disliking argument — " I will 
be a loafer." 

And so I went away, and while I went I was 
thinking, far down in my soul. And I said: " It 
must be everything or nothing; either I am a 
poet or I am not. I will act as if I were; I will 
burn my bridges behind me. If I am, I will win 
— for you can not kill a poet; and if I am not, I 
will die." 

Thus is it perilous. 

I fight the fight with all my soul; I give every 
ounce of my strength, my will, my hope, to the 
making of myself a poet. And when the time 
comes I write my poem. Then if I win, I win 
empires; and if I lose — 

" You put all your eggs into one basket," 
some one once said to me. 

" Yes," I replied, " I put all my eggs into one 
basket — and then I carry the basket myself." 

Xow I have come to the last stage of the jour- 
ney — the " one fight more, and the last." And 
can I give any idea of what is back of me, to nene 
me to that fight? I will try to tell you. 

For seven years I have borne poverty and 
meanness, sickness, heat, cold, toil — that I might 
make myself an artist. The indignities, the deg- 
radations — I could not tell them, if I spent all the 
time I have in writing a journal. I have lived in 
garrets — among dirty people — vulgar people — 
vile people; I have worn rags and unclean 
things; I have lived upon bread and water and 
things that I have cooked myself; I have seen my 
time and my strength wasted by a thousand hate- 
ful impertinences — I have been driven half mad 
with pain and rage; I have gone without friends 
— I have been hated by every one; I have 
worked at all kinds of vile drudgery — or stan'ed 
myself sick that I might avoid working. 

But I have said, " I will be an artist! " 


Day and night I have dreamed it; day and 
night I have fought for it. I have plotted and 
planned — I have plotted to save a minute. I 
have done menial work that I might have my 
brain free — all the languages that I know I have 
worked at at such times. I have calculated the 
cost of foods — I have lived on a third of the pit- 
tance I earned, that I might save two-thirds of 
my time. I once washed dishes in a filthy res- 
taurant because that took only two or three hours 
a day. 

I have said, " I will be an artist! I will fix my 
eyes upon the goal; I will watch and wait, and 
fight the fight day by day. And when at last I 
am strong, and when my message is ripe, I will 
earn myself a free chance, and then I will write 
a book. All the yearning, all the agony of this 
my life I will put into it; every hour of trial, 
every burst of rage. I will make it the hope of 
my life, I will write it with my blood — give every 
ounce of strength that I have and every dollar 
that I own; and I will win — I will win! 

" So I will be free, and the horror will be 
over." 

I have done that — I am doing that now. I 
mean to finish it if it kills me. — 


But I was sitting on the edge of the bed to- 
night, and the tears came into my eyes and I 
whispered: " But oh, you must not ask me to do 
any more! I can not do any more! It will leave 
me broken! " 

Only so much weight can a man carry. The 

next pound breaks his back. 

April 22d. 

I am happy to-night; I am a little bit drunk. 

To-day was one day in fifty. Why should it 
be? Sometimes I have but to spread my wings 
to the wind. Yesterday I might have torn my 
hair out, and that glory would not have come to 
me. But to-day I was filled with it — it lived in 
me and burned in me — I had but to go on and 
go on. 

The Captive! It was the burst of rage — the 
first glow in the ashes of despair. I was walking 
up and down the room for an hour, thundering 
it to myself. I have not gotten over the joy of it 
yet: "Thou in thy mailed insolence!" 

I wonder if any one who reads those thirty 
lines will realize that they meant eight hours of 
furious toil on my part! 

Stone by stone I build it. 
The whole possibility of a scene — that is what 


I pant for, always; that it should be all there, and 
yet not a line to spare; compact, solid, each 
phrase coming like a blow; and above all else, 
that it should be inevitable! When you stand 
upon the height of your being, and behold the 
thing with all your faculties — the thing and the 
phrase are one, and one to all eternity. 

April 24th. 

I was looking at a literary journal to-day. 
Oh, my soul, it frightens me! All these libraries 
of books — who reads them, what are they for? 
And each one of them a hope ! And I am to leap 
over them all — I — I? I dare not think about it. 

I have been helpless to-day. I can not find 
what I want — I struggled for hours, I wore my- 
self out with struggling. And I have torn up 
what I wrote. 

Blank verse is such a — such a thing not to be 
spoken of! Is there anything worse, except it 
be a sonnet? How many miles of it are ground 
out every day — sometimes that kind comes to 
me to mock me — I could have written a whole 
poem full of it this afternoon. If there are two 
lines of that sort in The Captive, I'll bum it all. 

An awful doubt came to me besides. Somebody 
had sown it long ago, and it sprouted to- 
day. " Yes, but will it be interesting? " 

Heaven help me, how am I to know if it will
