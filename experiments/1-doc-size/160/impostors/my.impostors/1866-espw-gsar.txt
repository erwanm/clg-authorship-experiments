somewhat less of his lordly style, — 

“ Well, I don’t care if I do. Come along.” 
Gypsy came along with a brighter face. 

The lane was looking somewhat seared and 
brown in the late August sun ; but the hazelnuts 
were ripe on the long row of bushes that 
grew by the wall, so that one could pick and 
eat as one walked ; then the sunlight was cool, 
and the wind was sweet and strong, — so that, 
on the whole, the half-mile walk to the pond 
was quite as pleasant as in the earlier summer. 
Upon the water it was much more comfortable 
than it would be under a burning July sun. 

Tom and Gypsy took each an oar, and 
pushed off into the shade of the Kleiner Berg. 
Then they let the Dipper float idly back and 
forth at the foot of the mountain, framed in by 
shadow and coolness and stillness. 


“ I wish you ’d tell me what you were going 
to say,” said Gypsy, leaning over the side of 
the boat to let her hand fall in the water. 

” Oh, nonsense ! let that go. I wasn’t going 
to say anything, and if I was, I ’ve forgotten it 
now. See here, do you know I go week after 
next? ” 

“Week after next! So soon! Why, I’d 
forgotten.” 

“Week after next Monday, at six A. M., 
ma’am.” 

“Tom, what do you suppose I ’m going to do 
without you?” 

“ Mend your dresses and run after puppies.” 

“ No, but,” said Gypsy, laughing in spite of 
herself, “ I mean really. I shall miss you 
terribly, Tom.” 

“ I ’ll risk it.” 

“Thom-as Breynton!'' 

She pulled her hand up suddenly out of the 
water, and jumped into his lap, throwing both 
her arms around his neck, her soft brown eyes 
looking into his. 



“Tom, don’t you know I shall miss you? 
Don’t you know I love you better than anything 
on this earth but mother ? And I haven’t been 
away from you more than a fortnight in all my 
life. Oh, Tom ! ” 

“You’ll tip the boat over,’’ said undemon- 
strative Tom. Nevertheless, he kissed her. 

“ I do believe you ’re glad to go,” said Gypsy, 
putting up her red lips reproachfully. 

“ Yale College is a jolly place. Swe-de-le- 
we-tchu-hi-ra-sa ! ” sang Tom. “ Can’t say I ’m 
sorry. I expect to have a gay time. Swe-de- 
le-we-dum ” 

“ I believe it ’s you that are glad to get rid of 
me, Tom.” 

“ Oh, no,” said Tom, coolly, “ not at all ; I ’ve 
no desire to get rid of you. You do very well 
for a girl.” 

“Well,” said Gypsy, half mollified, for this 
was Tom’s way of saying how much he loved 
her, “ anyway, I don’t think you ought to be 
glad to go.” 

Tom snapped a hazel-nut into the water, took 


off his cap, put it on, and then said, his manner 
suddenly changing, — 

“ I say. Gyp, it ’s rather queer work, a chap’s 
ending everything up so all at once, and starting 
out fresh.” 

“ Ending everything up? ” 

“The old high-school days, — there were a 
jolly set of boys there, Gypsy, no mistake, — 
and home and mother and all together.” 

“ Yes,” said Gypsy, musingly, “ it seems as 
if you needed something to start on, doesn’t 
it?” 

“ What do you mean? ” 

“ Why, I don’t know exactly ; something to 
make you know what to do and not make mis- 
takes.” 

“ I don’t believe you know what you ’re talking 
about,” said Tom. But Gypsy did know 
very well. She had a thought which it was 
hard for her to express, and which Tom’s manner 
of receiving it stopped short. But she did not 
forget it ; it came up another time. 

“ Let ’s go ashore ; I ’m tired of this,” said 




Tom, suddenly. Gypsy took her oar, and they 
rowed ashore in silence. 

“ Gypsy ! ” said Tom, when they had walked 
a little way. 

“ Tom ! ” 

“How much do you suppose father’s going 
to put me on a year? ” 

Gypsy felt at once that she had come to the 
root of matters ; this was what Tom had come 
out into the barn to talk about. 

“ I don’t know, I ’m sure. How much? ” 

“Only six hundred.” 

“ Only six hundred ! Why, Tom, I think 
that’s ever so much.” 

“That’s because you ’re a girl,” said Tom, 
with his superior smile, “ and that ’s all you 
know.” 

“ Why, if / had six hundred dollars ! ” 
began Gypsy. But Tom interrupted. 

“ I ’d as lief be put on rations and kept in a 
guard-house, while I ’m about it. I call it 
mean.” 

“ Mean ! Why, Tom, father wouldn’t be
