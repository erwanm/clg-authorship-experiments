courage to go in. 

While she stood there, one of the neighbours 
opened the door and came out crying. Gypsy 
caught a glimpse of Peace, and slipped in, and 
all her fear was gone. 

The doctor was there, dropping medicine at 
a little table by the window. Aunt Jane was 



there, fanning Peace gently, her stern face 
softened and shocked. Peace was lying with 
her hands folded, her face turned over on the 
pillow in the old way, her eyes closed. The 
Sabbath-like sunlight was falling in as it always 



fell into that room, — turning its bare floor 
and poor furnishing to gold, painting the 
patchwork quilt in strange patterns of light 
and shade, like some old tapestry, glorifying 
the face of Peace where it fell around and 
upon it. Gypsy, as she came in, had a fancy 
that it must look something like the faces of 
pictured saints framed in dusky niches of old 
cathedrals across the sea, — she had heard her 
mother tell about them. 

Peace did not hear her come in, and Gypsy 
had knelt down on the floor beside the bed, right 
in the light, which struck out sharply the con- 
trast between the two, before she knew that 
she was there. She opened her eyes suddenly 
and saw her. 

“ Oh — why, Gypsy ! ” 

Gypsy put up her hand, and Peace took hold 
of it. 

“ I ’m so glad you ’ve come,” she said, in her 
quiet voice, with the old quiet smile. And 
Gypsy said not a word for wonder. How 
could anybody smile who was going to die? 



“ Would it trouble you too much to stay a 
little while?” asked Peace, forgetting herself, 
remembering how to think for the comfort of 
others to the very last, as only Peace could do. 

“Trouble me! Oh, Peace! do you think 
I could go away?” 

“ I want to talk a little,” whispered Peace ; 
“ not now, — I can’t now. Perhaps I shall 
get a little breath by and by.” 

She said no more after that for a long time, 
and Gypsy knelt upon the floor, and held her 
hand, and watched her suffer, and could not 
help her, could not bear it for her, could only 
look on and break her heart in looking. 

How much Peace suffered, probably none of 
them knew. In her death as in her life, she 
made no complaint, uttered no cry of pain. 
Only once she called the doctor and said : — 

“If you could give me something! It 
seems as if I had borne as much as I can!' 

For weeks after, the pitiful, appealing words 
used to ring in Gypsy’s ears at night when she 
was alone. 



Tlicy gave her laudanum and she slept, and 
woke to lie in waking stupors, and slept again. 
The neighbours — rough-faced women in rags — 
came in, through the morning, to look their last 
at her, and go out crying. “ God bless her,” 
they said, “ the swate craythur ! — she always 
’ud lay so patient-like, there in the sunshine, 
an’ hear about a body’s throubles, whin the 
childer was sick an’ the man was took to drink, 
an’ sech a way of smilin’ as she had, the Houly 
Mither rest her soul ! ” ” It ’s greeting sair I 

shall be for her,” said one pale Scotchwoman, 
“ greeting sae sair.” The children — all the 
little, freckled, frowzy, dirty children that Peace 
always would find something beautiful about — 
came in to say good-bye and go out wondering 
who would tell them stories now. Mrs. Breyn- 
ton came down at noon, and stayed till her 
strength gave out, but long enough to see Peace 
look up conscious and smiling, and to under- 
stand the thanks which she could not speak. 
Aunt Jane sat by the bed, and moved gently 
about the room, and did what was to be done. 



still with that shocked, softened look upon her 
face, and Gypsy, watching her, wondered. 

The doctor left, and went to other patients. 
Peace passed from the stupor to sleep, and 


from sleep to stupor, and the clay wore on, but 
Gypsy never left her. 

She had no fear now of this mysterious 
presence which was coming; she did not dread 
to look upon it. The light that, sliding from 
window to window, still flooded the bed, made 
the face of Peace, even then, less like the face 
of death than like the pictured saint. 

As Gypsy knelt there on the floor through 
the long hours, awed and still, watching for 
Peace to waken, she did not wonder any more 
that Peace could smile when she was going 
to die. 

Her dream of the night came back to her 
suddenly. She saw again, as vividly as if she 
had lived it through, the warm waves of Galilee, 
the line of gold ; she heard the voice upon the 
shore, and saw the Figure with its hand upraised. 
And suddenly it came to her what 
dying meant to Peace, — all the freedom and 
the strength and the rest from pain. 

The thought was in her heart when Peace 
awoke at last, conscious and quiet. It was at 


the end of the afternoon, and the light was 
stealing into the west. They were all gone 
now but Aunt Jane and herself. 

“ Peace,” said her aunt, gently, “ Peace, 
dear.” 

But Peace, in her joy at seeing Gypsy there, 
saw nothing and heard nothing besides. Aunt 
Jane shrank back; she deserved it, and she 
knew it, but it was a little hard, now when she 
might — who knows? — have asked in death 
forgiveness for that which she had done and 
left undone to make life bitter.
