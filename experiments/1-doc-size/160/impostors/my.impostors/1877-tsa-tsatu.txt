been felt as a humiliation ; and so, she had been 



 

content to let her remain with those who had received her to their hearts and homes when God removed her widowed mother. But a change in her 
own life had come, bringing sorrow, bereavement, 
and misfortune ; and now her thought went out 
towards Grace, her sister 's child not lovingly, 
but selfishly not with a desire to be miuistrant to 
her conditions of life, but with a desire of being 
ministered to herself. From this state she sum 
moned, rather than invited, her niece ; and from 
this state sought to read her character and disposition, when she came, with eyes that endeavored 
to look into her very consciousness. That she 
was baffled in this will hardly be a matter of surprise. Persons of her class are without the key 
that unlocks the inner chambers of a soul whose 
life-mansions are not built on earthly foundations. 
Mrs. Fleetwood was a church- woman whose religion, up to the time when her sky became over 
cast, consisted in formal service alone. Beyond 
this she had no conception of duty to God. 
After all the blessedness of her natural life had 



 

been extinguished after children, fortune, 
frienis, were gone, and darkness drew down 
over her world like a curtain, then her selfish 
heart began to sigh for the blessedness of a life 
to come then she lifted her eyes toward the 
far-off mountains of heaven, which her imagina 
tion painted as beautiful with verdure, and balmy 
with the odors of immortal flowers. And still, as 
the pictures spread themselves all lovely to be 
hold, and fancy, as she dwelt upon them, gave 
ever multiplying attractions, she grew almost im 
patient to put off the poor, torn vestments of 
mortality, and rise into life eternal. 

You understand Mrs. Fleetwood now, and are 
not surprised at the curious look and falling brow 
with which she regarded her niece, whose coun 
tenance did not answer to her warmly uttered 
" Thank God for the life to come !" As the eyes 
of Grace fell away from those of her aunt, and 
thought-shadows crept about her lips and brow, 
Mrs. Fleetwood said, with a slight tremor of im 
patience in her tones 



 

" Maybe you don 't believe in another life." 

Instantly the eyes of Grace flashed up into 
those of Mrs. Fleetwood; not with any fire of in 
dignation in them, but with a light as pure as 
that which dew-drops gather from sunbeams a 
light full of hope and sweet anticipation. 

" I have been taught to thank God for the life 
to come, aunt, and to seek for it in duty and self- 
denial," replied Grace, a smile playing softly 
around her lips. 

A change was apparent in Mrs. Fleetwood 's 
face. Its expression was slightly puzzled. The 
brief answer was not satisfactory to her state, for 
it involved things admitted by common percep 
tion, yet not clearly seen. 

"I'm ean life in another world life in heaven, 
Grace." Mrs. Fleetwood 's manner was subdued. 

" There is no life in another world that is not 
born in this, aunt. So I have been taught." 

Mrs. Fleetwood gazed at her niece with a look 
of half perplexed inquiry. 



 

" The life to come must come here, or it can 
never come at all," added Grace. 

" Child, you talk in riddles !" said Mrs. Fleet- 
wood, moving impatiently. " I can 't get at your 
meaning. Life in this world is the present life, 
and life in the next world is the life to come. 
Isn 't that so ?" 

" There is natural life and there is spiritual life, 
aunt." 

" Well, child ?" 

" Natural life is the earthly life, and spiritual 
life the heavenly life." 

" Yes. Every Christian knows that." 

"Natural life, that into which we are born, 
and spiritual life, the life to come," said Grace, 
speaking slowly, and with significant emphasis. 

Mrs. Fleetwood, with lips slightly apart, sat 
looking into the earnest face of her niece, which 
seemed all at once to become instinct with 
thought. 

"The beginning in each of us of this life to 

come - -this heavenly life, aunt I have been 

taught to regard as the new-birth, without which, 
as our Lord has expressly said, we cannot en 
ter the kingdom of heaven. That which is 
born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born 
of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said 
unto you, ye must be born again. This is the 
life to come, aunt ; this is the actual rising into 
another state of existence. Death can make no 
change in the quality of our lives, aunt so I 
have been taught, and so do I believe. As our 
life is at death, so will it remain to eternity. We 
shall only pass from the world of material, to the 
world of spiritual things; and these spiritual things 
will be such as agree with our states and qualities 
of soul such as we have loved and delighted in 
here. If we have passed, by regeneration a new 
birth and a new growth into the full stSture of a 
spiritual man, then, our lives having been in hea 
ven while our bodies were yet upon the earth, we 
shall simply rise, by death, out of the material 
into the spiritual plane of existence, and live con 
sciously, as we lived before actually, among the 



 

angels. But, if our lives have been selfish and 
worldly, we shall pass by death into a conscious 
association with spirits of a like character, who 
have been our soul 's companions while our bo 
dies and our thoughts have been in this outward 
world." 

" You bewilder me, Grace," said Mrs. Fleet- 
wood, with a troubled look. " I can 't see clear. 
By God 's mercy, I hope to pass into heaven, 
when I leave this world. My Saviour died for 
me. I trust in him. He is able to save to the 
uttermost."
