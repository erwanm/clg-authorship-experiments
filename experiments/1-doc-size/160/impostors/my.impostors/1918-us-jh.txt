as to understand how such fanaticism had come to be. So 
Jimmie told about starvation and neglect, about overwork and 
unemployment, about strikes and jails and manifold oppressions. 
The other listened, nodding his head. Yes, of course, that was 
enough to drive any man to extremes. And then, thinking 
further, "I wonder," said he, "which of us two got the worse 
deal from life." 

Jimmie was without means of understanding that remark. 
Lacey had had everything, hadn't he ? To which Lacey answered, 
"I had too much, and you had too little; and which is worse 
for a man ?" 

By way of making clear what was in his mind, he told Jimmie 
a little about his own life. He pictured a big household, with a 
father beset by business cares, and turning over the managing 
of his home to employes. "My mother was a fool," said 
Lacey. "I suppose it sounds bad for a man to say that, but 
I've known it all my life. Maybe the old man was too busy 
to look up a woman with sense or maybe he didn't believe 
there were any. Anyhow, my mother's idea was to be seen 
spending more money than any other woman in town ; that was 
her 'position,' and her children were part of the show we must 
wear more clothes and bully more servants than anybody else's 
children. I've thought it all out I've had lots of opportunity 
for thinking of late. I can't remember when I didn't hit my 
nurse in the face if she tried to take away a toy from me. 
I never had to ask for anything twice if I did, I went into a 
tantrum and got it. I learned to smoke and to drink wine, 
and then came the women the women finished me. as you 
know." 





He paused; and Jimmie nodded sympathetically, remem- 
bering the story of the eight chorus-girls about whom "Wild 
Bill" had read out in the local. 

"If s hell for a boy to have a lot of money' said Lacey, 
"and to be preyed on by women. You have your human emo- 
tions, of course you're absolutely compelled to believe in some 
woman; and they're all perfectly cold-blooded at least the 
kinds that a rich boy meets. I don't mean only adventuresses 
I mean the society-girls, the ones you're supposed to marry. 
Their damned old harpies of mothers are pushing behind them, 
of course laying out everything they own for clothes, and 
not knowing how they can pay the bills for last season. They 
set out to catch you, they're mad with the determination, they 
don't care about reputation, they'll do any damned thing. You 
take them out in your car, and then they want to get out and 
pick flowers, and they draw you into the woods, and presently 
you've got hold of their hands, and then you're hugging and 
kissing them, and then you go the limit. But then you've got to 
marry them; and when they find you won't, they have hys- 
terics, and say they're going to shoot their heads off; only 
they don't shoot their heads off, they kiss you some more, and 
borrow your diamond scarf-pin and forget to return it." 

The young lord of Leesville fell silent. Sombre memories 
possessed him, and Jimmie, darting a swift glance at him, 
saw the look of weary age on his face. "I've never talked with 
anybody about what happened at the end," said he, "and I 
never mean to; but I'll say this much the time I loved a 
married woman was the only honest love I ever had, because 
she was the only woman who wasn't looking to marry me!" 

That was of course too subtle for a man like Jimmie Higgins. 
But this much the little Socialist got that the heir of the 
Granitch fortune had been in truth a miserably unhappy mortal. 
And this was an extraordinary revelation to Jimmie, who had 
taken it for granted that the rich were the lucky ones of earth. 
He had hated them on the supposition that they were without 
care; they were the Lotus-eaters, of whom the poet wrote that 
they 

"live and lie reclined 

On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind, 
For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd 
Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd 
Bound their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world: 



 

Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, 

Blight of famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands, 

Clanging fights and flaming towns, and sinking ships and praying 

hands. 

But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song 
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, 
Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong ; 
Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, 
Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, 
Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil. 

But now Jimmie had crossed the social chasm, he had seen the 
other side of the problem of riches and poverty. After that 
revelation, he would be more merciful in his judgments of his 
fellow-mortals; he would understand that the system in which 
we are trapped makes true happiness impossible for those 
who have too much as well as for those who have too little. 




WHILE Jimmie wandered through the streets of this French 
 town, letting his broken arm get strong again, the death- 
grapple of the war continued. In mid- July the Germans made 
a last desperate lunge at the Marne; they were stopped dead 
in a couple of days by the French and Americans combined; 
and then the Allied commander-in-chief struck back, smashing 
in the side of the German salient, and driving the enemy, still 
fighting furiously, but moving back from the soil of France. 
All France caught its breath with excitement, with relief 
mingled with dread. So many times they had hoped, through 
these four weary, hideous years, and so many times their hopes 
had been dashed ! But this time there was no mistake it was 
really the turning of the tide. The enemy resisted at every 
step, but he went on moving out of the salient, and the Allies 
went on lunging now here, now there, see-sawing back and 
forth, and keeping their opponents bewildered. 

Jimmie read about it in the army paper, the "Stars and 
Stripes"; and now, for the first time in four years, Jimmie's 
mind was one mind on the war. Jimmie was on the field of 
every battle, his teeth set, his hands clenched, his whole soul 
helping at the job. He had got over the disorders of anaes- 
thesia, and was forgetting the shock of his wound; he had 
realised that wounds, and even death, were something a man 
could bear not cheerfully, of course, not lightly, but you could 
bear them, if only you knew that the Beast was being put out 
of business. 

In the old days the word German had meant to Jimmie 
fellows like Meissner and Forster and Schneider; but now it 
meant a huge grey form looming over the edge of a shell-hole, 




its face distorted with hate, its bayonet poised to plunge. Per- 
haps the most vivid impression of Jimmie's whole life was the 
relief he had felt when he realised that some doughboy had 
shot a bullet into that looming figure. Let there be more 
doughboys, more and more, until the last figure had been shot ! 
Jimmie knew, of course, that the policy he had been advocating 
in America had not tended to that end; if Jimmie in Leesville 
had had his way, there would have been no doughboys to 
rescue Jimmie at Chatty Terry! Jimmie was quite clear on 
that point now, and for the time being the pacifist was dead 
in him.
