down in the dirt. The jerkins and 
cloaks are of all colors and fashions ; 
some short, reaching to the knee ; others 
dragging on the ground ; red, white, 
black, violet, yellow, guarded, laced, and 
faced ; hanged with points and tassels 
of gold, silver, and silk. The hilts of 






VELVET BREECHES AND CLOTH BREECHES 



 

daggers, rapiers, and swords are gilt 
thrice over, and have scabbards of vel- 
vet. And all this while the poor lie in 
London streets upon pallets of straw, 
or else in the mire and dirt, and die 
like dogs ! 

Stubbes was a stout old Puritan, bent 
upon hewing his way to heaven through 
all the allurements of this world, and 
suspecting a devil in every fair show. I 
fear that he looked upon woman as only 
a vain and trifling image, a delusive toy, 
away from whom a man must set his 
face. Shakespeare, who was country- 
bred when he came up to London, and 
lived probably on the roystering South 
Side, near the theatres and bear-gardens, 
seems to have been impressed with the 
painted faces of the women. It is prob- 
able that only town-bred women painted. 
Stubbes declares that the women of Eng- 
land color their faces with oils, liquors, 





 

unguents, and waters made to that end, 
thinking to make themselves fairer than 
God made them â€” a presumptuous au- 
dacity to make God untrue in his word ; 
and he heaps vehement curses upon the 
immodest practice. To this follows the 
trimming and tricking of their heads, the 
laying out their hair to show, which is 
curled, crisped, and laid out on wreaths 
and borders from ear to ear. Lest it 
should fall down it is under-propped with 
forks, wires, and what not. On the edges 
of their bolstered hair (for it standeth 
crested round about their frontiers, and 
hanging over their faces like pendices 
with glass windows on every side) is laid 
great wreaths of gold and silver curious- 
ly wrought. But this is not the worst 
nor the tenth part, for no pen is able to 
describe the wickedness. " The women 
use great ruffs and neckerchers of Hol- 
land, lawn, camerick, and such cloth, as 




 

the greatest thread shall not be so big as 
the least hair that is : then, lest they 
should fall down, they are smeared and 
starched in the Devil's liquor, I mean 
Starch ; after that dried with great dili- 
gence, streaked, patted and rubbed very 
nicely, and so applied to their goodly 
necks, and, withall, under-propped with 
supportasses, the stately arches of pride ; 
beyond all this they have a further fetch, 
nothing inferior to the rest ; as, namely, 
three or four degrees of minor ruffs, 
placed gradatim, step by step, one be- 
neath another, and all under the Master 
devil ruff. The skirts, then, of these 
great ruffs are long and side every way, 
pleted and crested full curiously, God 
wot." 

Time will not serve us to follow old 
Stubbes into his particular inquisition of 
every article of woman's attire, and his 
hearty damnation of them all and several. 





 

He cannot even abide their carrying of 
nosegays and posies of flowers to smell 
at, since the palpable odors and fumesof 
these do enter the brain to degenerate 
the spirit and allure to vice. They must 
needs carry looking-glasses with them; 
" and good reason," says Stubbes, sav- 
agely, " for else how could they see the 
devil in them ? for no doubt they are the 
devil's spectacles [these women] to al- 
lure us to pride and consequently to de- 
struction forever." And, as if it were 
not enough to be women, and the devil's 
aids, they do also have doublets and 
jerkins, buttoned up the breast, and made 
with wings, welts, and pinions on the 
shoulder points, as man's apparel is, for 
all the world. We take reluctant leave 
of this entertaining woman-hater, and 
only stay to quote from him a " fearful 
Judgment of God, shewed upon a gen- 
tlewoman of Antwerp of late, even the 




 

27th of May, 1582," which may be as 
profitable to read now as it was then : 
" This gentlewoman being a very rich 
Merchant man's daughter: upon a time 
was invited to a bridal, or wedding, which 
was solemnized in that Toune, against 
which day she made great preparation, 
for the pluming herself in gorgeous ar- 
ray, that as her body was most beauti- 
ful, fair, and proper, so her attire in ev- 
ery respect might be correspondent to 
the same. For the accomplishment 
whereof she curled her hair, she dyed 
her locks, and laid them out after the 
best manner, she colored her face with 
waters and Ointments : But in no case 
could she get any (so curious and dainty 
she was) that could starch, and set her 
Ruffs and Neckerchers to her mind : 
wherefore she sent for a couple of Laun- 
dresses, who did the best they could to 
please her humors, but in any wise they 
could not. Then fell she to swear and 
tear, to curse and damn, casting the Ruffs 
under feet, and wishing that the Devil
