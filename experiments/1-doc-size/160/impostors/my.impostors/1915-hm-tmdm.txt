at the masked ball of the Princess Parlova, who, by the way,
disappeared from New York shortly after the fire, no doubt because of
her fear of the Black Hundred.  The fire did not destroy the house, but
most of the furnishings were so thoroughly drenched by water that they
were practically ruined.  Her coming and going were a nine-days'
wonder, and then the public found something else to talk about.

Norton was a constant visitor at the Hargreave place.  There was to him
a new interest in that mysterious house, with its hidden panels, its
false floors, its secret tunnels; but he treated Jones upon the same
basis as hitherto.  One thing, however: He felt a sense of security in
regard to Florence such as he had not felt before.  So, between
assignments, he ran out to Riverdale and did what he could to amuse his
sweetheart.  Later they took short rides in the runabout, and at length
she became as lively as she had ever been.

But often she would catch Norton brooding.

"What makes you frown like that?"

"Was I frowning?" innocently enough.

"I find you this way a dozen times in an afternoon.  What is the
matter?  Are they after you again?"

"Heavens, no!  I'm only a vague issue.  They will not bother me so long
as I do not bother them.  It has dwindled into a game of truce."

"Do you think so?" eying him curiously.

"Why, yes."

"What's the use of trying to fool me, Jim?  If they haven't been after
you, you are sensing a presage of evil.  I'm not a child any longer.
Haven't I been through enough to make me a woman?  Sometimes I feel
very old."

"To me you are the most charming in all this wide world.  No, you're
not a child any longer.  You are a woman, brave and patient; and I know
that I could trust you with any secret I have or own.  But sometimes a
person may have a secret which is not his and which he hasn't any right
to disclose."

She became silent for a while.  "I hate money," she said.  "I hate it,
hate it!"

"It's mighty comfortable to have it around sometimes," he countered.

"As in my case, for instance.  If I were poor and had to work no one
would bother me."

"I would!" he declared, laughing.  "Come; let's throw off moods and go
into town for tea at the Rose Garden; and if you feel strong enough
we'll trip the light fantastic."

They had been gone from the house less than an hour when a man ran up
the steps of the veranda and rang the bell.  Jones being busy at the
rear of the house, the maid came to the door.

"Is Miss Hargreave in?" the stranger asked.

"No," abruptly.  The door began to close ever so slowly

"Do you know where I can find her?"

The maid eyed him with covert keenness; then, remembering that the
reporter was with Florence, said: "I believe she is at the Rose Garden
this afternoon."

"That is in town?"

"Yes."

"Thanks."  The man turned abruptly and ran down the steps.

The maid ran back to Jones.

"Why didn't you call me?" he demanded impatiently.

"There wasn't time."

"Did you tell him where she was?"

"Yes.  But I shouldn't have told him if Mr. Norton had not been with
Miss Florence."

Jones ran to the front, dashed out, eyed the back of the man hastening
down the street, smiled, and returned to his work, or, rather, to the
maid.  He took her by the shoulder, whirled her about, and shot a look
into her eyes that quailed her.

"Always call me hereafter, no matter what I'm doing.  That man has
never laid eyes on Florence and has no idea what she looks like.  Why
did you drug my coffee the night of that ball?"

She stepped back.

"And how much did they pay you for letting that doctor send Florence to
Atlantic City?  I know everything.  Hereafter, walk straight.  If you
play another trick I'll kill you with these two hands.  And listen and
tell this to your confederates: I always know every move they make;
that is why no one is missing from this house.  There is a traitor.
Let them find him if they can.  Will you walk straight, or will you
leave?"

"I--I will walk straight," she faltered.  "The money was too big a
temptation."

"Did they give it to you?"

"Yes.  And more to stay here.  But this is the first bit of dishonest
work I ever did."

"Well, remember what I have said.  Another misstep and I'll make an end
to you.  Don't think I'm trying to scare you.  You have witnessed
enough to know that it's life and death in this house.  Now run along."

At the garden Jim and Florence sauntered among the crowd, not having
any particular objective point in view.

"Sh!" whispered Jim.

"What is it?"

"Olga Perigoff is yonder in a box."

"Very well; let us go and sit with her.  Is she alone?"

"Apparently.  But don't you think we'd better go elsewhere?"

"My dear young man," said Florence with mock loftiness, "Olga Perigoff
has written me down as a simple young fool, and that is why, sooner or
later, I'm going to put the shoe on the other foot.  You and Jones have
coddled me long enough.  Inasmuch as I am the stake they are playing
for, I intend to have something more than a speaking part in the play."

"All right; you're the admiral," he said with pretended lightness.

So the two of them joined their subtle enemy, conscious of a tingle of
zest as they did so.  On her part, the countess was always suspicious
of this sleepy-eyed reporter.  She never could tell how much he knew.
But of Florence she was reasonably certain; and so long as she could
fool the pretty infant the suspicions of the reporter were a negligible
quantity.  She greeted them effusively and offered them chairs.  For
half an hour they sat there, chatting inanities, all the while each
mind was busy with deeper concerns.

When the man in search of Florence eventually arrived and asked the
manager of the garden if he knew Miss Hargreave by sight the manager
pointed toward the box.  The man wound his way in and out of the idlers
and by the time he reached the box Jim and Florence had made their
departure.  The man bowed, approached, and asked the countess if she
was Miss Hargreave.  For a moment Olga suspected a trap.  Then it
appealed to her mind that if there was no trap it might be well to pose
as Florence, if only to learn what the outcome might be.

"Yes.  What is wanted?" she asked.

The man took a letter from his pocket and handed it to Olga, saying:
"Give this to your father.  He knows how to read it."
