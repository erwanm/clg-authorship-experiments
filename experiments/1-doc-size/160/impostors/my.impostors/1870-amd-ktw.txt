“ But why didn’t you write ? ” 

“ I have written many times. It is so strange 
that no letter ever reached you, for I sent several 
to different friends. I ’ve been away over ten years, 
and yet the time appears very short to me. I ’m so 
glad to get back to you.” 


 


He kissed Aunt Ruth again fondly. “ My dear 
sisters,” he said, “ how you have waited and suffered ! 
My whole life shall be devoted to making amends for 
these years of absence.” 

There was a noisy raid at the kitchen door, and 
voices in high discussion. Mrs. Alston rose and 
went out. 

“ Mightn’t he let me have his top a teeny little 
while, mamma ? ” 

“ You don’t know how to spin it, Fred ; what ’s the 

use ? ” 

“ Hush, children. Freddy, wash your hands and 
face. There \s a great stranger in the parlor. Oh 
Rob ! ” Mrs. Alston’s voice quivered, and her eyes 
filled again. 

“Dear mother,” and Rob’s arms were around her 
neck, “ what has happened ? I’m sure we were poor 
enough, and have had our share of misfortunes — ” 

“ It ’s a wonderful joy, Rob. It has quite un- 
settled my nerves.” 

Rob kissed her and winked away a tear. Of late 
he had learned to love her better, and care for all her 
little anxieties. “ Well, if it ’s joy, I think I can 
stand it. But I don’t know of any one — ” 


 


“ It is dear Uncle Robert, whom we all thought 
dead.” 

“ Uncle Robert ! Hurrah ! Really and truly, 
mother ? Where is lie, — in the other room ? ” and 
Rob made a dash, then stopped suddenly. 

Uncle Robert came out. “ Here is the one I 
remember ; but he has changed, it must be confessed, 
from the wee baby with whom I used to frolic. 
Robert, my namesake, your mother ought to be 
proud of such a hue, manly boy.” 

Rob was seized with an unaccountable fit of shy- 
ness. This handsome great fellow, still young 
enough to be a boon companion in many things, was 
his own uncle ! He felt as if he had suddenly 
discovered a treasure. 

“ Me too, Uncle Robert,” said Fred, rushing in 
with a sublime disregard of grammar and a scorn of 
common introductions. 

“ He recalls poor Fred,” said Uncle Robert, taking 
him in his arms. “Dora, if the struggle has been 
hard, you have a nice family, and I ’m thankful they 
are all alive. While I live they shall have a father’s 
care.” 

Kathie came too. “ Oh Rob,” she exclaimed, “ I 




can’t make uncle seem a bit real. Doesn’t it sound 
like — like - — ” 

“ A fairy-story. Now, Katliie, here s a real live 
one. He ’s been in some enchanted palace seven 
years !” 

“ And I was playing with Lucy and Annie Gardi- 
ner when he came along, and he asked me the 
way.” 

“ Then I suppose he is your prince.” 

“ That’s just it,” said Uncle Eob. “She looked 
like a fairy out there on the hill, and she is to be 
mine. I ’ll build a castle for her — ” 

“ And take me too,” exclaimed Fred, enforcing his 
request with a thrust from his heel. 

“ Oh Freddy, don’t be so rough,” entreated Kathie. 
“ Uncle Eob, if you take me, all the rest will have 
to go.” 

“ Are you everybody’s good fairy ? ” 

“ Mine especially,” said her happy mother, passing 
her hand over Kathie’s shoulder. 

“ But, uncle,” began Eob, “ where have you been 
all these years ? You must have travelled a good 
deal.” 

“ I ’ve been half over the world, shipwrecked, 



murdered, taken prisoner, run away, hunted elephants 
in India, lions in Africa, dug gold in Australia — ” 

“ Oh Uncle Rob ! Mother, I want dreadfully to say 
' bully ’ for this once ! And you ’ll tell me all 
about it ? ” 

“ Let Uncle Robert get his breath. Don’t eat him 
quite up,” said their mother. 

“ I should be doubly unfortunate if, escaping all 
those dangers, I fall into the hands of cannibals 
now”; and Uncle Rob laughed as he kissed them 
all round. 

“ Katliie, we must be preparing some supper,” Mrs. 
Alston remarked. 

“We ’ll go entertain Aunt Ruth in the mean 
while ” ; and Uncle Rob marshalled the boys off to 
the parlor. It seemed as if everybody talked at once. 

“We ought to have something real nice,” Kathie 
said, reflectively. “ I ’ll make some biscuits.” 

“ If you will run to the store I ’ll attend to that.” 
Kathie found the basket, listened to her mother’s 
orders, and ran off cheerfully. Yet it was real hard 
to leave Uncle Rob, and she felt almost afraid that 
when she returned she would find it a dream. Just 
at the store door Miss Jessie passed her. 


 


“ Are they all well at home ? ” she asked. “ Why, 
you look bright as a rose.” 

“ Oh Miss Jessie, our Uncle Eobert that I once
