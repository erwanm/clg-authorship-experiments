THE MISTRESS. Don't interrupt, unless you 
have something to say ; though I should like to 
know how much gossip there is afloat that the 
minister does not know. The newspaper may 
be needed in society, but how quickly it drops 



 

out of mind when one goes beyond the bounds 
of what is called civilization. You remember 
when we were in the depths of the woods last 
summer how difficult it was to get up any inter 
est in the files of late papers that reached us, 
and how unreal all the struggle and turmoil of 
the world seemed. We stood apart, and could 
estimate things at their true value. 

THE YOUNG LADY. Yes, that was real life. 
I never tired of the guide's stories ; there was 
some interest in the intelligence that a deer had 
been down to eat the lily-pads at the foot of the 
lake the night before ; that a bear's track was 
seen on the trail we crossed that day ; even 
Mandeville's fish-stories had a certain air of 
probability ; and how to roast a trout in the 
.ashes and serve him hot and juicy and clean, 
and how to cook soup and prepare coffee and 
heat dish-water in one tin-pail, were vital prob 
lems. 

THE PARSON. You would have had no such 
problems at home. Why will people go so far 
to put themselves to such inconvenience ? I hate 
the woods. Isolation breeds conceit ; there are 



 

no people so conceited as those who dwell in 
remote wildernesses and live mostly alone. 

THE YOUNG LADY. For my part, I feel hum 
ble in the presence of mountains, and in the vast 
stretches of the wilderness. 

THE PARSON. I 'll be bound a woman would 
feel just as nobody would expect her to feel, 
under given circumstances. 

MANDEVILLE. I think the reason why the 
newspaper and the world it carries take no hold 
of us in the wilderness is that we become a kind 
of vegetable ourselves when we go there. I 
have often attempted to improve my mind in 
the woods with good solid books. You might 
as well offer a bunch of celery to an oyster. 
The mind goes to sleep : the senses and the 
instincts wake up. The best I can do when it 
rains, or the trout won't bite, is to read Dumas's 
novels. Their ingenuity will almost keep a man 
awake after supper, by the camp-fire. And there 
is a kind of unity about them that I like ; the 
history is as good as the morality. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I always wondered where 
Mandeville got his historical facts. 



 







THE MISTRESS. Mandeville misrepresents 
himself in the woods. I heard him one night 
repeat " The Vision of Sir Launfal " 

(THE FIRE-TENDER. Which comes very near 
being our best poem.) 

as we were crossing the lake, and the guides 
became so absorbed in it that they forgot to 
paddle, and sat listening with open mouths, as 
if it had been a panther story. 

THE PARSON. Mandeville likes to show off 
well enough. I heard that he related to a 
woods' boy up there the whole of the Siege of 
Troy. The boy was very much interested, and 
said " there 'd been a man up there that spring 
from Troy, looking up timber." Mandeville al 
ways carries the news when he goes into the 
country. 

MANDEVILLE. I 'm going to take the Par 
son's sermon on Jonah next summer ; it 's the 
nearest to anything like news we Ve had from 
his pulpit in ten years. But, seriously, the boy 
was very well informed. He 'd heard of Albany ; 
his father took in the Weekly Tribune, and he 
had a partial conception of Horace Greeley. 



 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I never went so far out of 
the world in America yet that the name of Hor 
ace Greeley didn't rise up before me. One of 
the first questions asked by any camp-fire is, 
" Did ye ever see Horace ? " 

HERBERT. Which shows the power of the 
press again. But I have often remarked how 
little real conception of the moving world, as it 
is, people in remote regions get from the news 
paper. It needs to be read in the midst of 
events. A chip cast ashore in a refluent eddy 
tells no tale of the force and swiftness of the 
current. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I don't exactly get the 
drift of that last remark ; but I rather like a 
remark that I can't understand ; like the land 
lady's indigestible bread, it stays by you. 

HERBERT. I see that I must talk in words of 
one syllable. The newspaper has little effect 
upon the remote country mind, because the remote country mind is interested in a very limited 
number of things. Besides, as the Parson says, 
it is conceited. The most accomplished scholar 
will be the butt of all the guides in the woods, 



 







because he cannot follow a trail that would puz 
zle a sable (saple the trappers call it). 

THE PARSON. It's enough to read the sum 
mer letters that people write to the newspapers 
from the country and the woods. Isolated from 
the activity of the world, they come to think 
that the little adventures of their stupid days 
and nights are important. Talk about that
