and spend the nights with him. It is all so different from 
what it used to be ! I can't exactly tell, but wonderfully 
enjoyable ; and it made me think continually of you." 

Mr. Van Alstyne felt a good deal annoyed at the 
"parson's freedom," as he termed it. In a fit of morti 
fied vanity, he half resolved to go away. The little 
Endicott might get fond of him." 

Then he discovered, with a man's sharp eyes, that 


Arthur Dudley was not altogether insensible to her 
charms. No, he would stay and see the fun out. 

The party had diminished so much, that Mr. Dudley 
and Mr. Van Alstyne were the only constant attendants. 
The drives, the sails, and rambles were to be taken over 
again. He had either Daisy or Mrs. Kinnard for a 
companion. 

He used to fancy sometimes, that, if he had met her 
before her foolish marriage, it was always foolish to 
him, she might have been the one woman to awaken 
his ambition, and lead him in some useful path. He 
quite forgot the many brilliant and rarely endowed women 
who had crossed his way. Still there was something 
eminently attractive in her very directness, her truth, and 
honor. Even a friendship with her there would be no 
breach of decorum in that. 

Ah ! her eyes were too clear. She had been trained, in 
her simple home, to finer reasonings than the picturesque 
imaginings of what might have been under different cir 
cumstances, or the so-called metaphysical distinctions 
that confuse vice and virtue. He was a handsome, 
attractive, cultured man ; but his specious arguments had 
no more weight with her from that fact. His dangerous 
beauty could make no impression on this woman ; and it 
stung him keenly. 

There was a week or ten days of odd, under-current 
skirmishing. Mrs. Kinnard was throwing her sister into 
Mr. Dudley's hands, that was evident ; and Dudley was 
going into the realms of fancy with rapid strides. But 
he could summon Miss Endicott back again. There was 
a subtle understanding between, something that would 
have been quite indescribable on Daisy's part, had she 
wanted to confess it ; and no pure, sweet soul like hers 
could have talked over a suspected love. It had not come 
near enough to isolate her, not even to set her thinking 
what this friendly tenderness on Mr. Dudley's part meant. 





September came in brilliantly, with magnificent sun 
sets that made the sea a glow of fire. Dr. Kinnard was 
to come for a week, and then the household would break 
np ; Mrs. Glyndon going on a westward tour with her 
husband. Nelly counted the daj's from no spirit of 
ungraciousness, but a positive longing for relief from the 
strain upon her. A thrilling fear had taken possession 
of her. Save Daisy she must, if she exerted herself to 
the utmost ; and never had Van Alstyne made himself 
more dangerous. She had the strong safeguard of a 
husband's love., and her own honor; but how was Daisy, 
to know the shoals and quicksands of this desperate 
tide! 

This was what Van Alstyne liked. He could not 
understand her noble impulse ; but he saw she was re 
solved to keep him away from her sister, even if she 
made the utmost exertion. It brought out the latent 
forces of her nature, many charming little ways that a 
society-belle might have envied for their dainty piquancy. 

"I shall have one more entertainment," said Mrs. 
Gbyndon. ' ' I want to ask the Daventrj-s and the Max 
wells ; but I am a little puzzled ; ' ' and there she 
paused. 

"About what?" asked Daisy, looking up from her 
game of chess with Van Alstyne, who was playing shame 
fully into her hands. 

"I want it to be real charming, of course. If the 
Howe party were here, we would make it music and con 
versation ; but the Daventry girls are extravagantby fond 
of dancing. Dr. Kinnard and Mr. Dudley will be here, 
and how to suit the different tastes " 

" "Why, have everything," said Van Alstyne, looking 
up with a glow of interest, talking for the sedate, music 
for the sentimental, and dancing for such commonplace 
people as Miss Endicott and I. There ! why do you not 
say ' check ? ' You may never have so good a chance 
again." 





" You have not been tiying in real earnest." 

"And j-ou consider me of so little worth, that you 
won't even take me at a game of chess." 

"I oh!" and Daisj' blushed distressfully under the 
glance of the deep eyes. 

" Yes, Mrs. Glyndon, that will be the best of all," he 
went on. " And then one of your dainty suppers." 

" There is not much space for dancing; but, if I do 
undertake it, I want your very best assistance, Mr. Van 
Alstyne. No indolent indifference, mind you. I should 
hate to have a failure." 

" We could open Nelly's room, you know," said Daisy. 

" And have the band from the hotel. Why, let me see, 
next Wednesdaj-, it will be almost full moon." 

' ' Just magnificent ! Now you have it all without any 
trouble." 

"I think we might make it really delightful. And 
there is Mrs. Kinnard and Bertie." 

Van Alstyne bent over to pick up a fallen chessman. 
"Remember," he said, "you are engaged to me fora 
good share of the dancing. Have you forgotten that my 
very first introduction to you was as partner for a qua 
drille?" 

No, she had not. And she was touched by his remem 
brance of it. 

They sent out their invitations, and everybody began to 
count on the pleasure. Afterward there would be a gen 
eral dispersion. Even Van Alstj'ne spoke of taking a 
little run up in Canada. 

Tuesday brought Dr. Kinnard. Nelly welcomed him 
with an hysterical cry of joy. 

" Well, you see I am not worn to skin and bone by 
any means," he said laughingly. " I think I could go 
through another summer with tolerable comfort, though I 
prefer an autumn sandwiched between. But I am quite 
satisfied with you. Why, you are positively radiant. 
Won't you be ashamed of an old chap like me? " 





" I am so glad to have you, so glad ! " she cried with
