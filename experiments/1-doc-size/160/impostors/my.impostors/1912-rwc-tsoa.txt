Amused yet resentful, perplexed, uncertain of this new phase of the man
beside her, she leaned back, head slightly lowered; but her gray eyes
were swiftly lifted every few moments to watch him. Suddenly she became
acutely conscious of her extended arm where her hand now was lightly in
touch with the rough cloth of his sleeve; and she checked a violent
impulse to withdraw her hand. Then, once more, and after all these
months, the same strange sensation passed through her--a thrilling
consciousness of his nearness.

Absolutely motionless, confused yet every instinct alert to his
slightest word or movement, she sat there, gray eyes partly lowered.

He neither spoke nor moved; his pleasant glance rested absently on her,
then wandered toward the quiet lake; and venturing to raise her eyes she
saw him smile to himself and wondered uneasily what his moment's thought
might be.

He said, still smiling: "What is it in that curious combination of
individualities known as Strelsa Leeds, that rejects one composite
specimen known to you as Mister Quarren?"

She smiled, uncertainly:

"But I don't reject you, Mister Quarren."

"Oh, yes, you do. I'm sensible of an occult wall between us."

"How absurd. Of course there is a wall."

"I've got to climb over it then----"

"I don't wish you to!"

"Strelsa?"

"W-what?"

"That wall isn't a golden one, is it?"

"I--I don't know what you mean."

"I mean money," he said; and she blushed from neck to hair.

"Please don't say such things----"

"No, I won't. Because if you cared enough for me you wouldn't let that
kind of a wall remain between us----"

"I ask you not to talk about such----"

"You wouldn't," he insisted, smiling. "Nor is there now any reason why
such a man as I am becoming, and ultimately will be, should not tell you
that he cares----"

"Please--if you please--I had rather not----"

"So," he concluded, still smiling, "the matter, as it stands, is rather
plain. You don't care for me enough. I love you--I don't know how much,
yet. When a girl interposes such an occult barrier and a man comes slap
up against it, he's too much addled to understand exactly how seriously
he is in love with the unknown on the other side."

He spoke in a friendly, almost impersonal way and, as though quite
thoughtlessly, dropped his left hand over her right which lay extended
along the back of the seat. And the contact seemed to paralyse every
nerve in her body.

"Because," he continued, leisurely, "the unknown does lie on the other
side of that barrier--your unknown self, Strelsa--undiscovered as yet by
me----"

Her lips moved mechanically:

"I wrote you--told you what I am."

"Oh, that?" He laughed: "That was a mood. I don't think you know
yourself----"

"I do. I am what I wrote you."

"Partly perhaps--partly a rather frightened girl, still quivering from a
sequence of blows----"

"Remembering all the other blows that have marked almost every year of
my life!--But those would not count--if I were not selfish, dishonest,
and a coward."

His hand closed slightly over hers; for a moment or two the pressure
left her restless, ill at ease; but she made no movement. And gradually
the contact stirred something within her to vague response. A strange
sense of rest subtly invaded her; and she remained silent and
motionless, looking down at the still lake below.

"What is the barrier?" he asked quietly.

"There is no barrier to your friendship--if you care to offer it, now
that you know me."

"But I don't know you. And I care for more than your friendship even
after the glimpse I have had of you."

"I--care only for friendship, Mr. Quarren."

"Could you ever care for more?"

"No.... I don't wish to.... There is nothing higher."

"Could you--if there were?"

But she remained silent, disturbed, troubled once more by the light
weight of his hand over hers which seemed to be awaking again the new
senses that his touch had discovered so long ago--and which had
slumbered in her ever since. Was this acquiescence, this listless
relaxation, this lassitude which was becoming almost painful--or
sweet--she did not understand which--was this also a part of friendship?
Was it a part of anything intellectual, spiritual, worthy?--this
deepening emotion which, no longer vague and undefined, was threatening
her pulses, her even breathing--menacing the delicate nerves in her hand
so that already they had begun to warn her, quivering----

She withdrew her hand, sharply, and straightened her shoulders with a
little quick indrawn breath.

"I've got to tell you something," she said abruptly--scarcely knowing
what she was saying.

"What, Strelsa?"

"I'm going to marry Langly Sprowl. I've said I would."

Perhaps he had expected it. For a few moments the smile on his face
became fixed and white, then he said, cheerfully:

"I'm going to fight for you all the same."

"What!" she exclaimed, crisply.

"Fight hard, too," he added. "I'm on my mettle at last."

"You have no chance, Mr. Quarren."

"With--him?" He shrugged his contempt. "I don't consider him at
all----"

"I don't care to hear you speak that way!" she said, hotly.

"Oh, I won't. A man's an ass to vilify his rival. But I wasn't even
thinking of him, Strelsa. My fight is with you--with your unknown self
behind that barrier. Garde Ã  vous!"

"I decline the combat, Monsieur," she said, trying to speak lightly.

"Oh, I'm not afraid of you--the visible you that I'm looking at and
which I know something about. That incarnation of Strelsa Leeds will
fight me openly, fairly--and I have an even chance to win----"

"Do you think so?" she said, lip between her teeth.

"Don't you?"
