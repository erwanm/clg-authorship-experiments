 





There could not in the nature of things be a perfect 
friendship between two such women. While many of 
their fancies tended to the same end, the processes were 
widely different: the one leisurely, cheerily, sweet, with 
fastidious ways and beliefs ; the other so direct, and both 
reticent: Mrs. Donaldson, from a fine, innate delicacy, 
and Christmas, because she has so little to conceal, and 
none of that longing dependence necessary to confidence. 

She is interested in the young girl, as any older woman 
might be; still her own affairs are paramount. Glen 
Ormiston was never really her home; in this cottage, 
small by comparison, yet roomy enough, Clara Donaldson 
stamps her individuality everywhere. It is the perfection 
of harmony, not the perfection of wealth. She would 
never destroy the former through any vulgar ambition. 
The home she had given up when her husband was overwhelmed 
by financial breakers had been very much more 
elegant in certain ways. But for her long and serious 
illness the blow might have brought out some stronger 
mental and moral characteristics. She had only to endure. 
Other hands must minister to her, and at Glen Ormiston 
the world of nature medicined her too kindly for her to 
repine at other losses. She had her husband and her 
children, and oh, blessed boon, life I Society was repre- 
sented in Leighton St. George I 

At Heath Avenue she established a position again. 
Her air of fine breeding impressed people ; her delicacy 
extorted that kind of reverential appreciation that is in- 
voluntarily paid to some women who are not always the 
highest and finest of types. She gave a few elegant after- 
noon teas, they were just coming in ; she had an evening, 
and a morning for calls. The remainder of her time be- 
longed to herself and family. 

As Miss Ormiston gathered a circle about her, there was 
less intimacy. They were always hearing of each other ; 
they met in some charitable works, and neither had any 

 

real need of the other, since their friendliness was more 
the sharing of ideas than thoughts. 

As misfortunes lower again, a new feeling haunts the 
elder woman. Why should her husband be so taxed, so 
weighted by Miss Ormiston's business? Why should he 
strain every nerve to keep her in luxury, since it cannot 
add anything to him? Indeed, when she learns that it 
has diminished his income, — for husband and wife have 
no secrets from each other, — a dull, smouldering, resentful 
heat withers up what has hitherto been kindly and generous. 

'' Why should you be so troubled?" she says, one even- 
ing, with voice and manner warmly sympathetic with him, 
but full of distaste for the cause. " You and St. Greorge 
did your duty grandly toward Miss Ormiston when it was a 
duty. If ill-fortune comes now, it is owing to the vary- 
ing contingencies of trade, not any fault of yours. Is it 
fair that you should waste your strength and energy, that 
belong to your family, gathering wealth for her?" 

Philip Donaldson looks steadily at his fair, graceful 
wife. She would inspire an artist ; she would stir a poet's 
blood to fine enthusiasm ; but he is a commercial man. 
What the painting and the poem are to the others, business 
is to him. If fate had made a soldier of him, she would 
have found him resolute and undaunted at the head of a 
forlorn hope. For the first time in his life he realizes — 
he has known it before, but it seems never to have been 
put to the test — that in these matters she cannot follow 
him, and it would be madness to let her lead. 

" It is not that alone, Clara. I have my standing as a 
business man. I should not like to be caught in a ruin 
the second time. Other people are full of perplexities, 
and we cannot step out of them as one might from a dis- 
agreeable call on a mere acquaintance." 

" If she is so strong and so wise, by this time she might 
have been trained to take the anxiety. You are merely 
her agent.'' 



 



 





" And if I was any other person's agent, he or she 
would expect the utmost in fidelity and perseverance.' 

" Would he or she," inflecting the pronouns curiously, 
" have a right to your strength, your very life? " 

" Not so bad as that" ; and he gives a dry little laugh. 
" Men do not die so easily, and duty is duty." 

Philip Donaldson turns back to his paper. His wife 
has a horror of nagging, and in all their married life they 
have never had a quarrel. She is silent now, but the 
resentment increases. To be jealous, in the vulgar sense, 
does not enter her mind. She would no more suspect her 
husband of gallant little familiarities than she would of 
crime ; perhaps, too, a deeper knowledge that light free- 
doms are utterly out of Miss Ormiston's sphere. But if 
another is to take time and strength, interest and en- 
deavor, nay, even accept sacrifices, — for surely in this 
question of wages he was not asked to begin with himself, 
— where is the limit? what will be the end? 

The next day another brand is thrown into the camp by 
the kindliest hand imaginable. Mrs. Donaldson's cousin 
writes to sound Philip concerning a position in a bank in 
a distant city, pretty, old, and rather provincial. The 
salary is not as high as that he is now receiving, but the 
responsibilities are much less. For a moment the prob- 
able ease tempts him. If St. George were here, he might 
be absolved from his trust. There are messages in the 
letter to his wife, and any word from Cousin Frank is 
most welcome. To keep the letter from Clara would be 
cowardly, and it might lead to an untruth at some future 
time ; but there is one sentence he wishes he could blot 
out before her eyes see it : — 

" Isn't Ormiston Mills rather shaky or run down or 
something? The foreman who is now at Price & Law- 
son's — Redding, I think his name is — gives a rather 
blue account of the concern. My dear Philip, I think it 
would be wisdom to quit a leaky ship before it goes quite 



 



 



 

down. TUnk serioiidy of my offer. We should like to 
have you." 

Clara's eyes brighten oyer the page of family gossip,
