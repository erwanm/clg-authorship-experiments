of Rezanov and Concha Arguello, who would 
have married before that humble altar and 



the history of California changed if the ironic 
fates had permitted. The story had been told 
him by Mrs. Hathaway, who was the daughter 
of one of the last of the grandees, and whose 
mother had lived in the Presidio when 
Rezanov sailed in through the Golden Gate 
and Concha Arguello had been La Favorita of 
Alta California. 

The little church was very quiet. The rest 
of the world seemed far away. Madeleine's 
fervid yielding imagination swept her back to 
that long-forgotten past when a woman to 
whom the earlier fates had been as kind as to 
herself had scaled all but the highest peaks of 
happiness and descended into the prof oundest 
depths of despair. Her sympathies, enhanced 
by her own haunting premonition of disaster, 
shattered her guard. She dropped her head 
into her hands and wept hopelessly. Masters 
felt his own moorings shake. He half rose 
to flee. But he too had been living in the 
romantic and passionate past and he too had 
been visited by moments of black forebodings. 
Love had tormented him to the breaking point 
before this and his ambition had often been 
submerged in his impatience for the excess of 



 

work which his newspaper would demand, exhausting to body and imagination alike. He 
had long ceased to doubt that she loved him, 
but her self-command had protected them 
both. He had believed it would never desert 
her and when it did his pulses had their way. 
He took her in his arms and strained her to 
him as if with the strength of his muscles and 
his will he would defy the blundering fates. 

Madeleine made no resistance. She was 
oblivious of everything but the ecstasy of the 
moment. When he kissed her she clung to 
him as ardently, and felt as mortals may, when, 
in dissolution, they have the vision of immortal bliss. She had the genius for completion and neither the past nor the future intruded upon the perfect moment when love 
was all. 

But the moment was brief. A priest entered and knelt before the altar. She disengaged herself and adjusted her hat with hands 
that trembled violently, then almost ran out 
of the church. Masters followed her. As they 
descended the steps Travers and his companion 
passed again, after their short canter down the 
peninsula. He stared so hard at Madeleine's 



 

revealing face that he almost forgot to take 
off his hat, and half reined in as if he would 
pause and gratify his curiosity} but thought 
better o£ it and rode on. 

Masters and Madeleine did not exchange a 
word until they had walked nearly a mile. 
But his brain was working as clearly as if passion had never clouded it, and although he 
could see no hope for the future he was determined to gain time and sacrifice anything 
rather than lose what little he might still 
have of her. He said finally, in a matter-of-fact voice: 

" I want you to use your will and imagination and forget that we ever entered that 
church.''

" Forget ! The memory of it will scourge 
me as long as I live. I have been unfaithful 
to my husband! '' 

" Oh, not quite as bad as that! " 

" What difference? I had surrendered completely and forgotten my vows, my religion, 
every principle that has guided my life. If 
— if — circumstances had been different that 
would not have been the end. I am a bad 
wicked woman.^ 



 

"Oh, no, you are not. You are a terribly 
good one. If you were not you would take 
your life in your hands and make it over." 

He did not dare mention the word divorce, 
and lest it travel from his mind to hers and 
cause his immediate repudiation, he added 
hastily: 

" You were immortal for a moment and it 
should be your glory, not a whip to scourge 
you. The time will come when you will remember it with gratitude and without a blush. 
You know now what you could be and feel. 
If we part at least you will have been saved 
from the complete aridity — '' 

" Part? " She looked at him for the first 
time, and although she had believed she never 
could look at him again without turning scarlet, 
there was only terror in her eyes. 

" I have been afraid of banishment." 
" It was my fault as much as yours." 
"I am not so sure. We won't argue that 
point. Is anything perfect arguable? But if 
I am to stay in San Francisco I must see you." 
" I'll never see you alone again." 
" I have no intention of pressing that point ! 
But the open is safe and you must walk with 
me every day." 



 

" I don't know! Oh — I don't know! And 
I think that I should tell Howard." 

" You will not tell Howard because you are 
neither cowardly nor cruel. Nor will you ruin 
a perfect memory that belongs to us alone. 
You do love me and that is the end of it — or 
the beginning of God knows what! " 

" Love ! " She shivered. " Yes, I love 
you. Why do poets waste so many beautiful 
words over love? It is the most terrible thing 
in the world." 

"Let us try to forget it for the present," 
he said harshly. " Forget everything we can- 
not have — " 

"You have your work. You have only to 
work harder than ever. What have I? " 

" We will walk together every day. We can 
take a book out on the beach and sit on the 
rocks. Read more fiction. That is its mission 
— to translate one for a time from the terrible 
realities of life. Your religion should be of 
some use to you. It is almost a pity there is 
no poverty out here. Sink your prejudices and 
seek out poor Sibyl Forbes. Every woman in 
town has cut her. In healing her wounds you
