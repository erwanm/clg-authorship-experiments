       [Exit.

Re-enter (speaks).

I must get home. I will get home. I will see Helen! (Stops
sharply, as if smitten by an unseen force; cannot take another step;
contends, as if with an invisible power; droops, as if vanquished;
turns, and retraces his way; his head hangs to his breast. He speaks.)
What thwarts me from my home? Who constrains me from my wife?
(Lifts his face angrily to the sky.) Is this hypnotism? (Laughs
sarcastically.) Am I an infant--or a maniac? It must be anæsthesia
passing off. Perhaps I was etherized by some blank fool after that
shock.--The accident! That is it, of course, of course! It is the
cerebral concussion--a simple case.... I shouldn’t like this to get out.
I believe I’ll go into my office--if I can find my office--and wait till
this passes off. It is a perfectly simple case. (Walks feverishly up
and down the street, searching for his own office; mutters.) Ever since
I yielded to that demand for a noon office hour downtown for business
men--it has crowded me without mercy. If they hadn’t been my old
patients, I wouldn’t have succumbed to it. It’s just another strand in
the whiplash that has driven me to death. Well (draws a long
breath)--I seem to be out of sorts to-night. I shall get over all this
nonsense when I see Helen. Helen will set me right. Helen will make a
live man of me again.


END OF SCENE II.


SCENE III.

The interior of a down-town office. DR. THORNE
is seen in the consulting room; the door is closed into
the reception room. One gas-jet burns over the desk;
patient’s chair and physician’s chair are seen in the
usual places; the desk is in order for the night; a
movable telephone, of the kind in use in offices, stands
upon the desk.

DR. THORNE (throws himself heavily
into his revolving chair). What the devil
am I here for? (Violently. The light
grows dim as he says this.) Why in--why
in the name of all the laws of Nature
cannot I get home? (After a pause, brokenly.)
Well--well! It’s something to
be here; to get out of the street--in out
of the night--it’s a good deal. I’d begun
to understand how outcasts feel--felons,
apparitions, fugitives. In the name of the
laws of mystery, thank Heaven for so much!
(The light brightens. It reveals his face,
which is haggard and pinched. He pushes
his case books about, aimlessly. Suddenly
his hand hits the receiver of the telephone.
He springs and cries out:) The telephone!
The telephone! I must have gone stark
mad not to think of it.--See! I’m not a
drinking man, am I? (Puts his hand to
his head.) No. I do not drink. Helen
would not like to have me.--No. And
I’ve been all these hours without telephoning
to Helen. She’ll think I did it on purpose--poor
Helen--because of the words
I said. If a man could slay the words he
says.... They harry me--like ghosts.
(Rings the telephone violently.) Central?
48.4--48.4, I say. Why don’t you give
me 48.4? I tell you I’m in a hurry. 48.4!
And be quick with it! (Rings again.) Why
in--why don’t you attend to your business
there? It is Dr. Thorne--Dr. Esmerald
Thorne. My errand is most urgent. Give
me my home, and make short work of it.
48.4! Do you hear? (Rings again.)

(A MAN’S VOICE FROM THE EXCHANGE
comes faintly over the wire, reverberating
through the transmitter, so as to be audible
at a distance from the instrument.) Why
don’t you speak? We cannot make out a
word you say.

DR. THORNE (rings again, wildly). I
tell you I want my home--48.4! I must
speak to my wife. Give me 48.4--Helen?
Helen!

VOICE FROM THE TELEPHONE. Stop
ringing your bell if you can’t use your
tongue. Put your mouth close to the transmitter.
Are you drunk? Or are you dead?

DR. THORNE (still ringing). I will report
you for this. It shall cost you your
place. 48.4, I say. Give me my house.
I will not submit to this. Give me 48.4!

(The telephone ceases to reply.)

DR. THORNE (rises, hangs up the receiver,
and paces the office tempestuously;
speaks). The very forces of Nature are in
league against me.... My own nervous
system--the night--the atmosphere--electricity--they
are all gone foes to me.
They are serried like an army between myself
and her. Helen will be--Helen will
suffer--oh, poor girl!

(The telephone call bell rings suddenly.)

DR. THORNE (leaping to the receiver).
Who calls? I am here. Who wants Dr.
Thorne? (He snatches the receiver greedily
to his ear; listens a moment; cries
wildly:) Oh, Helen! Is that you, dear?
Speak louder, darling.... Yes, I’m
here--at my office down-town. I’ll be
home soon. Don’t be frightened--but I
met with a trifling accident. Helen? Helen!
What’s the trouble? Don’t you hear me,
Helen?

WOMAN’S VOICE FROM THE TELEPHONE.
Is my husband there? Esmerald! Are
you there?

DR. THORNE. Why, Helen! Don’t you
hear me? What does ail this cursed telephone?
Central! Give me a decent wire.
My wife can’t hear a word I say....
Helen? I’m not at all hurt--only shaken
up a little. I’ll get back just as soon as--Helen?
Helen!

WOMAN’S VOICE FROM THE TRANSMITTER.
Central? I cannot find my husband at his
office. Please give me the Hospital.--I
must communicate with my husband.

(VOICE FROM THE TRANSMITTER dies
away.)

DR. THORNE (rings madly). Central,
you’ve cut me off! You’ve cut me off
from my home. Give me 48.4 again.
Helen?--Helen! Can’t you hear me?
Don’t you understand me, Helen? Oh, I
could hear you--your own dear voice, my
girl! I wanted to tell you--I can’t wait
till I see you to say--Helen? She does
not hear me.--Helen!

(The transmitter is silent.)

(DR. THORNE lays the receiver down. He
hides his face in his hands.)
