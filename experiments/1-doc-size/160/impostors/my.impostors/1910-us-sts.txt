When the boy had finished, he sprang up excited- 
ly and grasped his hand. " Samuel Prescott," 
he cried, " put it there! You are a brick! " 

" Then you'll stand by me ! " exclaimed Sam- 
uel, breathless with relief. 

"Stand by you?" echoed the other. "I'll 
stand by you till hell freezes sohd! " 

Then he sat down again, and began tapping 
nervously on the desk with his pencil. " I'll call 
a special meeting of the local," he said. " They 
must take you up. The movement's been slow 
in Lockmanville of late, and a fight like this is 
just what the comrades need." 

"But I'm not a Socialist!" objected Samuel. 

" That's all right," replied Everley, " we don't 
care about that." 

Samuel had not meant it that way, but he 
could not think how to make his trouble clear. 

" I can get the local together to-morrow night," 
went on the other. " There's no time to be lost. 
We must get out a lot of circulars and cover the 
town." 

" But I only wanted the people of the church 
to come," said the boy. 

" But others will come anyway," said Everley. 
" And haven't the people a right to know how 
.they've been robbed? " 

" Yes," said Samuel, " they have." 

" And perhaps," added the other with a smile. 





" if the congregation has a little pressure from 
outside, it will be much more apt to take action. 
What we've got to do with this thing is to make 
a free speech fight out of it, and open the eyes of 
the whole town. Otherwise the police will nip 
the thing in the bud, and no one will ever know 
what we had." 

" You must be careful how you give out those 
circulars," put in Johann. " They will nip you 
there, if they can." 

" That's all right," laughed Everley. " You 
trust the comrades for that ! We know a printer 
we can rely on I " 

Samuel drew a deep breath of satisfaction. 
Here was a man who understood things, and 
took hold with conviction — a man who was really 
willing to do something. It was very disconcert- 
ing that he happened to be a Sociahst! 

Everley took up a pencil and wrote the new 
announcement: 

"PEOPLE OF LOCKMANVILLE ! 

" Having made the discovery that members of 
the vestry of St. Matthew's Church had been 
bribing the city council, I demanded an investi- 
gation, and I was turned out of the church. 

" I called a meeting to tell the congre- 
gation about it, but I was refused a permit 
to speak. Chief of Police McCullagh declared 





to me that I should never make my speech in 
this town. 

" Will you stand by me? 

" I intend to speak on Wednesday night, at 8 
P.M., at the vacant lot opposite the church. 

" In the name of Free Speech and Civic Dey' " Samuel Pbescott." 

" How's that? " he asked. 

" Fine! " exclaimed Samuel in delight. 

" I'll take the risk of having it set up," added 
the lawyer. " And I'll get the notices to the 
members of the local off in this evening's mail. 
Come, we'll go to see one or two of them now 
and talk it over with them." 

So they went down, and while Johann hurried 
back to his work, Samuel and Everley stopped 
in a cigar store a couple of doors down the street, 
kept by a little Russian Jew with a merry face 
and dancing black eyes. " Comrade Lippman," 
'ssaid Everley, " this is Mr. Prescott." 

"Biiere came also " Comrade Minsky," from the 
rear workroom, a cigarmaker, bare-armed and 
very yellow and emaciated. To them Everley 
told briefly the story of Samuel's adventures and 
what he proposed to do. The glow of excitement 
with which they received the tidings left no doubt 
as to their attitude. And a couple of blocks 
around the corner was a little shop where a 





grizzled old carpenter, " Comrade 'Beggs," 
clutched Samuel's hand in a grip like one of his 
vises, while he expressed his approval of his coiu-se. 
And then they called on Dr. Barton, a young 
physician, whom Everley declared to be one of 
the mainstays of the local of the town. " He got 
his education abroad," he explained, " so he has 
none of the narrowness of our physicians. His 
wife's quite a speaker, too." 

Mrs. Barton was a sweet-faced and mild-look- 
ing lady, who reminded Samuel of the picture 
of his mother. All the while that Everley was 
telling his story the boy was staring at her, and 
trying to straighten out the tangle of perplexity 
that was caused in his mind by the idea of her 
being a Socialist speaker! 

By and by the doctor came in, and the story 
had to be told yet again. They were so much 
interested and excited that they begged their 
visitors to remain to luncheon. They talked the 
whole problem out, and Samuel was struck by 
the certainty with which their minds took hold 
of it. There was no need of any long explana- 
tions with them — they seemed to know just what 
to expect ; it was as if they possessed some magic 
key to the inner life of Lockmanville, enabling 
them to understand everyone in it, and exactly 
how he felt and exactly how he would act under 
any given circximstances.
