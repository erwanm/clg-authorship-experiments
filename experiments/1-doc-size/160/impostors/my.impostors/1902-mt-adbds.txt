ish match — the kind one rubs on a 
safety-box. I found it in the road, 
622 feet from the abolished cabin. 
What does it say? This: that the 
train was fired from that point. What 
further does it tell us? This: that 
the assassin was left-handed. How 
do I know this? I should not be able 
to explain to you, gentlemen, how I 
know it, the signs being so subtle "uferte 

signs 

that only long experience and deep 
study can enable one to detect them. 
But the signs are here, and they are 
re-enforced by a fact which you must 
have often noticed in the great detec- 
tive narratives — that all assassins are 
left-handed." 

"By Jackson, that's so!'' said Ham 
Sandwich, bringing his great hand 
down with a resounding slap upon 
his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought 
of it before." 

"Nor II" "Nor I!" cried several. 
" Oh, there can't anything escape him 
— look at his eye!" 

"Gentlemen, distant as the mur- 
derer was from his doomed victim, he 
did not wholly escape injury. This 
fragment of wood which I now ex- 
hibit to you struck him. It drew 
blood. Wherever he is, he bears the 
telltale mark. I picked it up where 
he stood when he fired the fatal train." 

He looked out over the house from 
his high perch, and his countenance 
began to darken; he slowly raised 
his hand, and pointed — 
"There stands the assassin !"

For a moment the house was para- criminal 
lyzed with amazement ; then twenty 
voices burst out with: 

"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, Ml, not
Him? It's pure foolishness !" 

" Take care, gentlemen — be not 
hasty. Observe — he has the blood- 
mark on his brow' 

Hillyer turned white with fright. 
He was near to crying. He turned 
this way and that, appealing to every 
face for help and sympathy ; and held 
out his supplicating hands toward 
Holmes and began to plead: 



"Don oh, don't! I never did it; 
I give my word I never did it. The 
way I got this hurt on my forehead 
was — " 

"Arrest him, constable I" cried 
Holmes. "I will swear out the war- 
rant." 

The constable moved reluctantly for- 
ward — hesitated — stopped. 

Hillyer broke out with another ap- 
peal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do 
it; it would kill mother! You know 
how I got the hurt. Tell them, and 
to the rescue save me, Archy; save me!'' 

Stillman worked his way to the 
front, and said : 

"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be 
afraid." Then he said to the house, 
" Never mind how he got the hurt ; it 
hasn't anything to do with this case, 
and isn't of any consequence' 

"God bless you, Archy, for a true 
friend!" 

"HuiTah for Archyl Go in, boy, 
and play 'em a knock-down flush to 
their two pair 'n' a jack!" shouted 
the house, pride in their home talent 
and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty 
to it rising suddenly in the public 
heart and changing the whole atti- 
tude of the situation. 

Young Stillman waited for the noise 
to cease ; then he said, 

"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand 
by that door yonder, and Constable 
Harris to stand by the other one here, 
and not let anybody leave the room." 

" Said and done. Go on, old man!" 

"The criminal is present, I believe. 
I will show him to you before long, 
in case I am right in my guess. Now 
I will tell you all about the tragedy, 
from start to finish. The motive 
wasn't robbery ; it was revenge. The 
murderer wasn't light - witted. He 
didn't stand 622 feet away. He didn't 
get hit with a piece of wood. He didn't 
place the explosive against the cabin. 
He didn't bring a shot-bag with him, 
and he wasn't left-handed. With the 
exception of these errors, the distin- 
guished guest's statement of the case 
is substantially correct.'' 

A comfortable laugh rippled over 
the house; friend nodded to friend, as 
much as to say, ''That's the word, 
with the bark on it. Good lad, good 
boy. He ain't lowering his flag 
any!" 

The guest's serenity was not disturbed. 
Stillman resumed: 

" I also have some witnesses ; and I 
will presently tell you where you can 
find some more.'' He held up a piece 
of coarse wire; the crowd craned their 
necks to see. " It has a smooth coating 
of melted tallow on it. And here 
is a candle which is burned half-way 
down. The remaining half of it has 
marks cut upon it an inch apart. 

Soon I will tell you where I found 
these things. I will now put aside 
reasonings, guesses, the impressive 
hitching of odds and ends of clews 
together, and the other showy theatricals 
of the detective trade, and tell you 
in a plain, straightforward way just 
 how this dismal thing happened'
