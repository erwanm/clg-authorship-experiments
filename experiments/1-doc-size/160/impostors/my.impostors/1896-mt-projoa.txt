but because of the loveliness of her character. These 
names she kept, and one other — the Brave. 

We grew along up, m thaF plodding and peaceful 
region, and got to be good-sized boys and girls — big 
enough, in fact, to begin to know as much about the wars 
raging perpetually to the west and north of us as our elders, 
and also to feel as stirred up over the occasional news 
from those red fields as they did. I remember certain of 
these days very clearly. One Tuesday a crowd of us were 
romping and singing around the Fairy Tree, and hanging 
garlands on it in memory of our lost little fairy friends, 
when little Mengette cried out : 
' Look ! What is that ? ' 

When one exclaims like that, in a way that shows 
astonishment and apprehension, he gets attention. All 
the panting breasts and flushed faces flocked together, and 
all the eager eyes were turned in one direction — down the 
slope, toward the village. 

' It's a black flag.' 

' A black flag ! No— is it ? ' 

' You can see for yourself that it is nothing else.' 

' It was a black flag, sure ! Now, has any ever seen the 
like of that before ? ' 

' What can it mean ? ' 

' Mean ? It means something dreadful — what else ? ' 

' That is nothing to the point ; anybody knows that 
without the telling. But tvhat? — that is the question.' 



' It is a chance that he that bears it can answer as well 
as any that are here, if you can contain yourself till he 
come.' 

' He runs well. Who is it ? ' 

Some named one, some another ; but presently all saw 
that it was Etienne Roze, called the Sunflower, because he 
had yellow hair and a round, pock-marked face. His 
ancestors had been Germans some centuries ago. He 
came straining up the slope, now and then projecting his 
flag-stick aloft and giving his black symbol of woe a wave 
in the air, whilst all eyes watched him, all tongues dis- 
cussed him, and every heart beat faster and faster with 
impatience to know his news. At last he sprang among 
us, and struck his flag-stick into the ground, saying : 

' There ! Stand there and represent France while I 
get my breath. She needs no other flag, now.' 

All the giddy chatter stopped. It was as if one had an- 
nounced a death. In that chilly hush there was no sound 
audible but the panting of the breath-blown boy. When 
he was presently able to speak, he said : 

' Black news is come. A treaty has been made at 
Troyes between France and the English and Burgundians. 
By it France is betrayed and delivered over, tied hand and 
foot, to the enemy. It is the work of the Duke of Bur- 
gundy and that she-devil the Queen of France. It marries 
Henry of England to Catharine of France ' 

' Is not this a lie ? Marries the daughter of France to 
the Butcher of Agincourt ? It is not to be believed. You 
have not heard aright.' 

' If you cannot believe that, Jacques d'Arc, then you 
have a difficult task indeed before you, for worse is to 
come. Any child that is born of that marriage — if even a 
girl — is to inherit the thrones of both England and France, 
and this double ownership is to remain with its posterity 
for ever ! ' 

' Now that is certainly a lie, for it runs counter to our 
Salic law, and so is not legal and cannot have eff"ect,' said 
Edmond Aubrey, called the Paladin, because of the armies 
he was always going- to eat up some day. He would have 
said more, but he was drowned out by the clamours of the 
others, who all burst into a fury over this feature of the 
treaty, all talking at once and nobody hearing anybody, 
until presently Haumette persuaded them to be still, saying

' It is not fair to break him up so in his tale ; pray let 
him go on. You find fault with his history because it 
seems to be lies. That were reason for satisfaction—
kind of lies— not discontent. Tell the rest, Etienne.' 

' There is but this to tell : Our King, Charles VI., is to 
reign until he dies, then Henry V. of England is to be 
Regent of France until a child of his shall be old enouo-h 
to '  

' Tza man is to reign over us— the Butcher  It is 

lies! all lies!' cried the Paladin. ' Besides, look you— 

what becomes of our Dauphin ? What says the treaty 
about him ? ' 

' Nothing. It takes away his throne and makes him 
an outcast.' 

Then everybody shouted at once and said the news was 
a he ; and all began to get cheerful again, saying, ' Our 
Kmg would have to sign the treaty to make it good ; and 
that he would not do, seeing how it serves his own son.' 

But the Sunflower said : ' I will ask you this : Would 
the Queen sign a treaty disinheriting her son ? ' 
 That viper? Certainly. Nobody is talking of her 
Nobody expects better of her. There is no villany she will 
stick at, if It feed her spite ; and she hates her son. Her 
signing It is of no consequence. The King must sign ' 

I will ask you another thing. What is the King's con- 
dition ? Mad, isn't he ? ' 

' Yes, and his people love him all the more for it It 
brings him near to them by his sufferings ; and pityinp- 
him makes them love him.' 

' You say right, Jacques d'Arc. Well, what would you 

of one that is mad ? Does he know what he does ? No. 
Does he do what others make him do ? Yes. Now, then, 
I tell you he has signed the treaty.' 

' Who made him do it ? ' 

' You know, without my telling. The Queen.' 

Then there was another uproar — everybody talking at 

once, and all heaping execrations upon the Queen's head. 

Finally Jacques d'Arc said : 

' But many reports come that are not true. Nothing 
so shameful as this has ever come before, nothing that cuts 
so deep, nothing that has dragged France so low ; there- 
fore there is hope that this tale is but another idle rumour. 
Where did you get it ? ' 

The colour went out of his sister Joan's face. She 
dreaded the answer ; and her instinct was right. 

' The cure of Maxey brought it.' 

There was a general gasp. We knew him, you see, for 
a trusty man.
