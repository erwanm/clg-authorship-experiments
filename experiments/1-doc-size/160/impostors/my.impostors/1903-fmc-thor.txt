rotting and mouldy nest for hideous spiders and 
noisome creatures that haunt the dark. 

The air was very cold, and was laden with the inde- 
scribable smell of dried slime which belongs to deep 
wells which have long been almost quite dry. It was 
clearly a long time since the little stream had over- 
flowed its channel, but at the first examination he had 
made Malipieri had understood that in former times 
the water had risen to within three feet of the vault. 
Up to that height there was a thin coating of the dry 
mud, which peeled off in irregular scales if lightly 
touched. The large fragments of masonry that half 
covered the floor were all coated in the same way with 
what had once been a film of slime. 

The air, though cold, could be breathed easily, and 
the lights did not grow dim in it as they do in sub- 
terranean places where the atmosphere is foul. The 
stream of water, flowing swiftly in its deep channel 
from under the little arch, brought plentiful ventilation 
into it. Above, there was no aperture in the vault- 
ing, but there was one in the mediaeval masonry that 
projected into the chamber. There, on the side towards 
the right, where the water flowed in, Malipieri had 
found a narrow slit, barely wide enough to admit a 
man's open hand and wrist, but nearly five feet high, 
evidently a passage intended for letting the water flow 
into the interior of the construction when it overflowed 
its channel and rose above the floor of the chamber. 





At first Malipieri tad supposed that this aperture 
eommunicated with some ancient and long-forgotten 
drain by which the water could escape to the Tiber ; 
it was not until he had gained an entrance to the 
hollow mass of masonry that he understood the hideous 
use to which it had been applied. 

It had not been hard to enlarge it. Any one who 
has worked among ruins in Italy could tell, even blind- 
fold, the difference between the w^ork done in ancient 
times and that of the middle ages. Roman brickwork 
is quite as compact as solid sandstone, but mediaeval 
masonry was almost invariably built in a hurry by bad 
workmen, of all sorts of fragments embedded in poorly 
mingled cement, and it breaks up with tolerable ease 
under a heavy pickaxe. - 

In half a day Malipieri and Masin had widened the 
slit to a convenient passage, but as soon as it had been 
possible to squeeze through, the architect had gone in. 
He never forgot what he felt when he first looked 
about him. Masin could not follow him until many 
blows of the pick had widened the way for his bulkier 
frame. 

Malipieri stopped at the entrance now, holding his 
lantern close to the ground, and looking for traces of 
footsteps. He found none, but as he was about to 
move forward he uttered an exclamation of surprise, 
and picked up a tiny object which he held close to the 
light. It was only a wax match, of which the head 
had been broken off when it had been struck, so that 
it had not been lighted. That was all, but neither he 



 

nor Masin carried wax matches in the vaults, because 
the dampness soon made them useless. They took 
common sulphur matches in tin match-boxes. Be- 
sides, this was an English wax light, as any one could 
tell at a glance, for it was thicker, and stiffer, and 
longer than the cheaper Italian ones. 

Malipieri drew back and showed it to his man, who 
examined it, understood, and put it into his pocket 
without a word. Then they both went in through the 
aperture in the wall. 

The masonry outside was rectangular, as far as it 
could be seen. Inside, it was built like a small circular 
cistern, smoothly cemented, and contracting above in a 
dome, that opened by a square hole to the well-shaft 
above. Like the stones in the outer cjiamber, the 
cement was coated with scales of dried mud. The 
shaft was now certainly closed at the top, for in the 
daytime not a ray of light penetrated into its blackness. 

The lanterns illuminated the place completely, and 
the two men looked about, searching for some new trace 
of a living being. The yellow light fell only on the 
remains of men dead long ago. Some of the bones lay 
as they had lain since then, when the drowned bodies 
had gently reached the floor as the " lost water " sub- 
sided! Malipieri had not touched them, nor Masin 
either. Two skeletons lay at full length, face down^ 
wards, as a drowned body always sinks at last, when 
decay has done its loathsome work. A third lay on its 
side, in a frightfully natural attitude, the skull a little 
raised up and resting against the cemented wall, the 





arms stretched out together, the hands still clutching a 
rusty crowbar. This one was near the entrance, and if, 
in breaking their way in, Malipieri and Masin had not 
necessarily destroyed the cement on each side of the 
slit, they would have found the marks where the dead 
man's crowbar had worked desperately for a few min- 
utes before he had been drowned. Malipieri had im- 
mediately reflected that the unfortunate wretch, who 
was evidently the mason of whom Sassi had told him, 
had certainly not entered through the aperture formerly 
made from above in the outer chamber, since the narrow 
slit afforded no possible passage to the well. That 
doubtless belonged to some other attempt to find the 
treasure, and the fact that the mason's skeleton lay in- 
side would alone have shown that he had got in from 
above, most likely through a low opening just where 
the dome began to curve inward. A further search 
had discovered some bits of wood, almost rotted to 
powder, which had apparently once been a ladder. 

A much less practised eye than the architect's would 
have understood at a glance that if a living man were 
let down through the shaft in the centre of the dome, 
and left on the floor, he could not possibly get up even 
as far as the other hole, since the smooth cement offered 
not the slightest hold; and that if the outflow o*f the 
stream from the first chamber were arrested, the water 
would immediately fill it and rise simultaneously in the 
well, to drown the victim, or to strip his bones by its 
action, if he had been allowed to die of hunger or thirst. 
It was clear, too, that if the latter form of death were 



 

chosen, he must have suffered to the last minute of his 
life the agony of hearing the stream flowing outside, not 
three paces from him, beyond the slit. Human imagi- 
nation could hardly invent a more hideously cruel 
death-trap, nor one more ingeniously secret from the 
world without. 

The unhappy mason's ladder had perhaps broken 
with his weight, or his light had gone out, and he had 
then been unable to find the horizontal aperture, but he 
had probably entered through the latter, when he had 
met his fate. The fact was, as Malipieri afterwards 
guessed, that the hole through the vault outside had
