must; but Ben could elude his father under his father's 
eyes. 

Next morning while he was dressing he took up the 
money and unrolled it, and sat down, aghast. He had 
thought it some such sum as was commensurate with their 
modest uses, perhaps double the six dollars he had given 
Ardelia, in her trouble. But now he sat there slipping the 
bills and counting in a perfect daze. He swore a little
too, picturesquely. His habit of eccentric swearing al- 
ways amused the boys and made him the more indubitably 
a leader. For he was a leader. His audacity of speech 

and act, his idleness they dared not emulate, his success in 

 

escaping logical penalties, carried him far. Now, when 
he had convinced himself that he had made no mistake, 
he rolled up the bills again and slipped a band about them. 
Where could he put them? Mother had a way of going 
over the room, straightening clothes and corralling un- 
tidy treasures. She was seized with a madness for clean- 
ing closets and setting Hannah to wash the floor. There 
was an old husk bed under his mattress, and he tucked the 
roll into one comer of it. But in another minute, when 
he heard his father calling, he answered hastily, and then 
hurried to the bed and pulled the money out. This 
would be the day, by some malicious fate, when mother 
would be moved by a desire to sun and air the husks. 
Now he put his booty into an old shoe in the closet, and 
snatched it out again because mother would take the shoe 
away to be mended. At last he tied the roll in a handker- 
chief and thrust it deep into his pocket, grinning as he 
did it: for he remembered a day when one of the little 
Gleasons had been playing about the house while the 
mother was helping Hannah wash blankets and Ben had, 
in sportiveness, stood him on his head. The Gleason boy 
had begged piteously not to be reversed, and rightly, for 
out of his pocket fell the solder he had just stolen from 
the barn. Ben was glad he was of suflBcient height to es- 
cape betraying indignities. 

When he went down to breakfast, his father and mother 
were both at the table and in silence. Mary looked like 
a beautiful pale image of some sad but exalted emotion, 
and Thomas bent over his plate and ate fast, regardless 
of her. He looked up, frowningly. 

" You'll have to get up with the sun after this," he said. 
" Trueman an' I've done a day's work a'ready." 

"I overslept," said Ben. "I don't know how it is," 
he added> with the smooth frankness that always made some 



 

headway with his father, "but I'm sort of tired, now 
school's over. I guess studying does tire you out. You 
know the minister broke down." 

" You go into the hayfield," said Neale. " You've had 
books enough for one spell." 

When the meal was over, he pushed his chair back and 
looked at his wife. It was the first direct glance he had 
given her since the night of her revolt. Her heart gave 
a responsive throb of sick foreboding; but on the whole 
she was glad. Any reproach, any penalty even, would 
be better than his silence. The depleting effect of that 
was more than she felt within herself the strength to bear. 

" Well," said he, as if he grudged the words, " where's 
he gone to? " 

Mary looked at him in a pallid courage. This was, she 
believed, the supreme trial of her life, and she was in haste 
to meet it. She felt the warmth of Hugh's arms about 
her ; but most she felt the softer touch of his baby fingers. 
He was something she had to be loyal to, at every ex- 
pense of her own blood and sorrow, and to defend. So 
she said nothing. But in an instant she recalled herself. 

" Ben, you run out doors," she said, as if she were send- 
ing him from his elders' troublesome controversies, to play. 

Neale struck the table with the side of his hand : not an 
alarming blow, â€” only a masterful tap to bid the two re- 
member he was governing the scene. 

"You stay here. I'll ask you first. Do you know 
where he is? " 

" No," said Ben, open-eyed in innocence. " I don't. 
Honest, I don't." 

" You seen him since the dance at the 'Cademy ? " 

"No," said Ben guilelessly. "I guess he rvm away 
right after the dance, didn't he? We came home alone, 
you know." 



 

Thomas believed him. He was likely to believe Ben. 
Indeed he was always inclined to believe everybody in di- 
rect address, because he lacked imagination to picture an 
actual defiance of his authority. 

" Now," said he, turning his eyes upon Mary, " what 
you got to say? " 

Mary's gaze upon him was of a liquid beauty he could 
not read. The past had blurred his power to scan such 
a page. There was warning in her look, not reproach but 
warning to him not to disturb the fair certainties of life 
too rudely. And there was love, too, perhaps not for him, 
since he was showing himself her adversary, but for her son. 

" Thomas,'' said she, " I haven't a word to say." 

His questions came short and gruff. 

" Do you know where he's gone? " 

"Yes," said Mary. The answer was beautiful in its 
beseeching intonation. " No farther," she seemed to be 
bidding him, " no farther, or you will step on sacred 
things." 

" You seen him since he went? " 

"Yes." 

"When?" 

" I saw him after you forbid him the house." Wounded 
pride was in that. She did resent Hugh's banishment 
from the place where she worked for her sons and their 
father. " I called him to come in. I told you I was 
going to. He was out there in the dark, and I did call 
him." 

"D'he come in?" 

" No," said Mary, rather haughtily. " He wouldn't. 
You'd forbid him your house and he took you at your 
word." 

" You seen him since? " 

" Yes."
