"And Mr. Henderson," said she, "may we depend on you, too?"

"By all means," said I, as I sat industriously gathering up the lilies
into bunches and tying them.

"Mr. Henderson is in a hopeful way," said Eva. "I think we may have him
in the true church some of these times."

"I am afraid," said Ida, "that Mr. Henderson, having seen you only in
Lent, won't be able to keep track of you when the Easter rejoicings
begin, and the parties recommence."

"Oh dear me!" said Eva, with a sort of shudder, "To think of that horrid
wedding!"

"That's just like Eva," said Alice. "She's been, and been, and been to
these things till she's tired out with them; whereas, I am just come
out, and I like them, and want more of them. I don't think they are
horrid at all. I am perfectly delighted about that Elmore wedding. One
will see there all the new things, and all the stunning things, and all
the latest devices from Paris. I was in at Tullegig's the other day, and
you never saw such a sight as her rooms are! Somebody said it looked as
if rainbows had been broken to pieces and thrown all round. She showed
me all the different costumes that she was making up for the various
parties. You know there are to be seven bride's-maids, and each of them
is to wear a different color. Madame thinks 'C'est si gentil.' Then,
you know, they are making such grand preparations up at that chateau
of theirs. The whole garden is to be roofed in and made a ball room of.
I think it will be gorgeous. I say, Mr. Fellows, if you and Mr.
Henderson would like it, I know I could manage cards for you."

Jim assented, heartily, for both of us; and I added that I should like
to see the affair; for I had never seen enough of that sort of thing to
take away the novelty.

After tea we all sallied out to the church with our trophies. We went in
two carriages, for the better accommodation of these, and had a busy
time disembarking at the church and carrying them in. Here we met a
large committee of co-workers, and the scene of real business commenced.
Jim and I worked heroically under the direction of our fair
superintendents. By midnight the church was a bower of fragrance and
beauty. The chancel seemed a perfect bed of lilies, out of which rose
the great white cross, shedding perfume upon the air. The baptismal font
was covered with a closely woven mosaic of fragrant violets, and in each
panel appeared an alternate red or white cross formed of flowers. The
font was filled with a tall bouquet of white saint's-lilies, such as
gardeners force for Easter.

Eva and I worked side by side this evening, and never had I seemed to
know her more intimately. The fact is, among other dangerous situations
to a young man's heart, none may be mentioned more seductive than to be
in a church twining flowers and sorting crosses and emblems in the still
holy hours of the night. One's head gets, somehow, bewildered; all
worldly boundaries of cold prudence fade away; and one seems to be
lifted up to some other kind of land where those that are congenial
never part from each other. So I felt when, our work being all done, I
retired with Eva to the shadow of a distant pew to survey the whole
result. We had turned on the gas-light to show our work, and its beams,
falling on thousands of these white lily-bells and on all the sacred
emblems, shed a sort of chastened light. Again, somehow, as if it had
been a rose-leaf floating down from heaven, I found that little hand in
mine; and we spoke low to each other, in whispers, of how good and how
pleasant it was to be there, and to unite in such service and
work--words that meant far more than they seemed to say. Once, in the
course of the evening, I saw her little glove where it had fallen into a
nest of cast-off flowers, and, as no one was looking, I seized upon it
as a relic, and appropriated it to my own sacred memories. Nor would I
surrender it, though afterward I heard her making pathetic inquiries for
it. Late at night I went home to think and dream, and woke with the
first dim gray of morning, thinking of my appointment to meet her at the
church.

It is a charming thing to go out in the fresh calm morning before any
one is stirring. The bells for early service were dropping their notes
here and there, down through the air, as if angels were calling men to
awake and remember that great event which happened so silently and so
unregarded, many, many years ago. I thought as I walked through the dim
streets and saw here and there an early worshiper, prayer-book in hand,
stealing along, of the lonely women who, years ago, in Jerusalem, sought
the sepulchre to see where they had laid Him.

Little twittering sparrows filled the ivy on the outside of the church
and made it vibrate with their chirpings. There was the promise in the
brightening skies of a glorious sunrise. I stood waiting awhile, quite
alone, till one by one the bands of youths and maidens came from
different directions.

I had called Jim as I went out, but he, preferring to take the utmost
latitude for sleep, looked at his watch and told me he would take
another half hour before he joined us.

Eva was there, however, among the very first. The girls, she said, were
coming. We went into the dim church together and sat ourselves down in
the shady solitude of one of the slips waiting for the morning light to
pour through the painted windows. We said nothing to each other; but the
silence was sociable and not blank. There are times in life when silence
between two friends is better than speech; for they know each other by
intuition.

Gradually the church filled with worshipers; and as the rising sun
streamed through the painted windows and touched all the lilies with
brightness, a choir of children in the organ-loft broke forth into
carols like so many invisible birds. And then, the old chant,

  "Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more,"

seemed to thrill every heart.

After the service came a general shaking of hands and greetings from
neighbors and friends, as everybody walked round examining the
decorations.

"Now, Mr. Henderson," said Eva, as she stood with me surveying this
scene, "is not a church which preserves all these historical memorials a
most lovely one? Ought we not thus to cherish the memory of that
greatest event that ever happened in this world? And how beautiful it
is to bring up children year after year by festivals like these, to mark
off their life in acts of remembrance."

"You speak truly," I said, sharing her enthusiasm. "I could wish the
church of all good people had never ceased to keep Easter; indeed, they
who do disregard it seem to me a cold minority out of the great
fellowship. I think it is fortunate that the Romish and the Episcopal
churches are bringing us, descendants of the Puritans, back to those
primitive customs. I, for one, come back willingly and joyfully."


[Eva Van Arsdel to Isabel Convers.]

My Darling Belle:--I have been a naughty girl to let your letter lie
so long. But my darling, it is not true, as you there suggest, that the
bonds of sisterly affection, which bound us in school, are growing
weaker, and that I no longer trust you as a confidential friend. Believe
me, the day will never come, dearest Belle, when I shall cease to unfold
to you every innermost feeling.

And now to come to the point about "that Mr. Henderson." Indeed, my
love, your cautions are greatly mistaken. It is true that, much to my
surprise, he has taken a fancy to visit quite intimately at our house,
and has made himself a general favorite in the family. Mamma, and Aunt
Maria, and all the girls like him so much. But, then, you must know he
is generally set down as Ida's admirer. At all events Ida and he are
extremely good friends; and when he calls here he generally spends the
largest part of the evening in her sanctum; and they have most edifying
conversations on all the approved modern topics--the Darwinian theory,
woman's rights, and everything else you can think of. One thing I admit
is a little peculiar--he notices everything that I say in
conversation--I must own. I never saw such an observing creature. For
example, the first evening he was at our house, I just accidentally
dropped before him the remark that I was going to early morning
services in Lent, and would you believe it?--the next morning he was
there too, and walked home with me. I was the more astonished, because
he does not belong to the Church--so one would not expect it, you know.
He is a member of the Bethany Church himself, but he seems delighted
with our services, and talks about them beautifully--as well as our
rector could. I really wish you could have heard him! He seems to have
such an earnest, thoughtful mind; and what I like in him is, that he
never flatters, and talks that matter-of-course complimentary nonsense,
that some men think is the thing to be talked to ladies; neither has he
that way of talking down to one that superior men sometimes have, when
