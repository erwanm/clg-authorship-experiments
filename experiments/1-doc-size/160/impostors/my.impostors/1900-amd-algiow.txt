Family funerals were almost as grand occasions as marriages at this
period. The great house was filled with guests, and there was no
unseemly haste to bury the dead out of their sight. The funeral
procession might have been that of a famous man. When they returned
the relatives were gathered in the darkened parlor where the candles
stood lighted on a table, and Archibald Floyd's will was read in a dry,
decorous tone by the little old lawyer who had made wills for half a
century.

As was expected, the Pineries and slaves and appurtenances of all kinds
went to Brandon, who was the only son. The girls had an equal money
portion. The widow was provided with a home; certain rooms were set
apart for her, certain slaves were bequeathed to her with the bed and
table linen and some of the furnishings that she had brought with her;
and Brandon was to pay her a regular income out of the estate, which
was to cease at her death. A very fair and just will, it was agreed on
every side.

Meanwhile there had been no perceptible change in Mr. Greaves. He did
not suffer much; he was fed and cared for like a child. Some days he
brightened and talked with encouraging coherence, but it was mostly
about his early life, and he now and then mistook his sister for his
dead wife. And though Marian had gone over several times, he had not
seemed to recall her specially.

Miss Greaves was in her element. She had not taken kindly to the
prospect of being deposed, though the training of women in her day
led them to accept the inevitable without complaining. She was rather
proud, too, that her brother had won a young woman; and Marian's sudden
gravity after her engagement had given her considerable satisfaction.

"The doctor holds out very little hope of perfect recovery," she said
to the younger woman at one call. "He thinks brother's mind will never
be quite right again. He has a good appetite now and sleeps well, but
it is very sad to be stricken down in the very prime of life. On our
mother's side we are a long-lived race. I had an aunt who lay paralyzed
for seven years, and was eighty when she died."

Marian shuddered. Her father's failing health had demanded most of
her attention. Was she in any way relieved? She tried not to think of
it. No one referred to the marriage, except now and then some of the
slaves, who counted up all the bad signs in an awesome fashion.

Dolly had enjoyed everything to the uttermost, and was delighted
with her new home and her new relatives. Communication between even
the most important cities was tardy at that time, and often sent by
private messenger. Yet the political interest of the States was kept
up keenly, almost to rivalry. New England, whose commerce had been
injured the most, complained loudly. The States were between two fires.
England was bringing all her power to bear upon the Emperor Napoleon.
Neither country paid any attention to the rights of neutrals. There
was the old romantic remembrance of France coming to our assistance
in our mighty struggle with the mother country; but there were a
hundred relationships with England where there was one with France,
and Napoleon's ruthlessness had alienated the noblest sense of the
community.

Yet living went on in the lavish, cordial Virginian fashion at the
old plantation, if it was not quite so full of gayety. There were two
attractive young women now, and the young men were haunting the house,
planning riding parties and a day's outing to some grove or wood, a
sail down or up the Potomac, and a three-days' visit to some neighbor
who rather regretfully gave up dancing on account of the recent death.
Louis had been putting in law with his other studies, and was not to
graduate for another year.

Roger Carrington was now a steady visitor, and all the household knew
he was young missy's lover. Her father's assent had been cordially
given. Her own was still in abeyance. Jaqueline had a willful streak
in her nature. If someone had opposed, she would have sided at once
with her lover. But everybody agreed. Mrs. Carrington treated her as
a daughter already, and longed to have the engagement announced. Roger
pleaded.

"I want to be quite sure that I love you better than anybody," she
would say with a kind of dainty sweetness. "If one should make a
mistake!"

"But we are such friends already. We have been for a long time. Surely
if you disliked me you would have found it out before this."

"But I don't dislike you. I like you very much. Only it seems that
things which come so easy----"

She let her lovely eyes droop, and the color came and went in her face.
How exquisite her rose-leaf cheeks were! He wished he had the right
to kiss them fifty times an hour. A husband would have. But there was
a fine courtesy between lovers of that day. And there was always some
curling tendril of shadowy hair clustering about her fair temples. Her
ear, too, was like a bit of sculpture, and the lines that went down her
neck and lost themselves in the roundness of her shoulders changed with
every motion, each one prettier than the last, and were distractingly
tempting.

"I'm sure it doesn't come easy to me," he said in a rather curt tone.

"Oh, doesn't it? I thought there really was no mistaking the grand
passion on a man's part--that he was convinced in the flash of an eye."

"It is when he wishes to convince that his doubt arises. If I could
persuade you----" longingly.

"I am always afraid I shall be too easily persuaded," she returned
plaintively. "I sometimes wonder if I really have a good strong mind of
my own. Do you know, I should like to be one of the heroic women; then
in case war should come--there are such talks about it, you know--and
I had to send you away----"

She looked so utterly bewitching that he had much ado not to clasp her
to his heart.

"You are heroic enough. And you are tormenting to the last degree. I
wonder sometimes if you even like me!"

"Oh, you know I like you," carelessly.

"If you would once say 'I love you.' You like so many people--young
men, I mean."

"Why, when you have been brought up with them, so to speak----" and she
looked up out of large, innocent eyes. "There are the Bakers, you know.
Georgie, Rob, Teddy, and I have played together always. Would you have
me turn haughty now?"

"I don't mind the Bakers, and Teddy is as good as engaged to Hester
Fairfax, who really does adore him."

"Yes, I think she does," gravely. "He is always describing her
perfections and her sweetnesses, as if we hadn't quarreled and declared
we wouldn't speak to each other and done little spiteful tricks that
girls always do, and--and gotten over it, and know all about each
other."

"I don't believe you were ever very spiteful. That takes a small
nature."

She looked furtively from under her long lashes, as if considering.

"Well--Patty and I quarrel. You must know that I haven't the most
amiable temper in the world when I am roused."

"Yes." She could be very tormenting.

"And I like to have my own way. Papa generally gives in. And sometimes
I feel self-condemned that mamma is so good to me."

"Then you have a conscience?"

"I don't believe my own mother would have been so easy. And there's
grandmamma----"

"Who would have led you to find out your mind in short order," he
commented quickly.

"Her mind, you mean. And if she had resolved that I shouldn't marry
you, you would have been sent to the right-about at once. And that
reminds me--Lieutenant Ralston is coming down next week. But I suppose
you are not afraid of him, since his heart is--oh, can you tell where
it is? Sometimes I think he still cares for Marian, and then he is so
