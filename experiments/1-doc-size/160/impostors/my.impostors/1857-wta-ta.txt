" You dzee ! " exclaimed Joe, doubling hid fiat, 
and bringing it down with the intention of hitting 
the table by his side to emphasize his resolution; 
but, unfortunately, he missed the table — a circum- 
stance which seemed to foreshadow the fate of nis 
resolve. 

Jce proceeded to declare in his broken speech what 
a shock he had received when he went home, half an 
hour before, — the first time for several days, — and 
heard the reproaches of his suffering wife, how grate- 
ful he was to Harry, and what a villain he considered 
himself. Either the sufferings of his family, on the 
rum he had drank, melted his heart, and he was as 
eloquent as his half-paralyzed tongue would permit. 
He was a pitiable object ; and having assured him- 
self that Joe's family were comfortable for the night, 
Major Phillips put him to bed in his own house. 

Harry was not satisfied with himself; he had per- 
mitted his temper to get the better of him. He 
thought of Julia on her bed of suffering, wept for her, 
and repented for himself. That night he heard toe 
clock on the Boylston market strike twelve before ft« 
ciosevi his eyes t" sleep. 




The next day, while he was at work in the s'.able, 
i hoy of about fifteen called to see him, and desired 
to speak with him alone. Harry, much wondering 
who his visitor was, and what he wanted, conducted 
him to the ostler's chamber. 

" You are Harry West," the boy began. 

" That is my name, for the want of a better," re- 
plied Harry. 

" Then there is a little matter to be settled be« 
tween you and me. You helped my folks out his* 
night, and I want to pay you for it." 

" Your folks ? " 

" My name is Edward Flint." 

" Then you are Joe's son." 

" I am," replied Edward, who did not seem to fee] 
much honored by the relationship. 

'* Your folks were in a bad condition last night." 

:< That's a fact ; they were." 

" But I didn't know Joe had a son as old as jou 
are." 

" I am the oldest ; but I don't live at home, *n«J 
Vave not for three years. How much did you nay 
out for them last night ? " 




*' One dollar and twenty cents." 

" As much as that ? " 

" Just that." 

Edward Flint manifested some uneasiness ai the 
announcement. He had evidently come with a pur- 
pose, but had found things different from what he 
had expected. 

" I didn't think it was so much." 

" What matter how much ? " asked Ham 

" Why, I want to pay you." 

u You needn't mind that." 

" The fact is, I have only three dollars just now; 
and I promised to go out to ride with a fellow next 
Sunday. So, you see, if I pay you, I shall not have 
enough left to foot the bills." 

Harry looked at his visitor with astonishment ; he 
did not know what to make of him. Was he in 
earnest ? Would a son of Joseph Flint go out to 
ride, — on Sunday, too, — while his mother and his 
brother and sisters were on the very brink of starva- 
tion ? Our hero had some strange, old-fashioned 
uoticns of his own. For instance, he considered it 
son's duty to take care of his mother, even if he




were obliged to forego the Sunday ride ; that he 
ought to do all he could for his brothers and sisters, 
even if he had to go without stewed oysters, staj 
away from the theatre, and perhaps wear a little 
coarser cloth on his back. If Harrv was unreasona- 
ble in his views, my young reader will remember that 
he was brought up in the country, where young 
America is not quite so " fast-" as in the city. 

" I didn't ask you to pay me," continued Harry. 

" I know that ; but, you see, I suppose I ought to 
pay you. The old man don't take much care of the 
family." 

Harry wanted to say that the young man did not 
appear to do much better ; but he was disposed to 
oe as civil as the circumstances would permit. 

" You needn't pay me." 

" O, yes, I shall pay you ; but if you can wait till 
the first of next month, I should like it." 

" I can wait. Do you live out ? " 

" Live out ? What do you mean by that ? I am 
a clerk in a store down town," replied Edwaro with 
ifiended dignity. 

" How are you ? Do they pay you well ? " 



" Pretty fair ; I get five dollars a week." 

" Five dollars a week ! Thunder ! I should thiai 
you did get paid pretty well ! " exclaimed Harry, 
astonished at the vastness of the sum for a week'l 
work. 

" Fair salary," added Edward, complacently. 
" What are you doing here ? " 

" I work in the stable and about the house." 

" That's mean business," said Mr. Flint, turning 
up his nose. 

" It does very well." 

" How much do you get ? ' 

" Six dollars a month and perquisites."
