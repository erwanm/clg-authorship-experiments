practical at the moment, and, in fact, so far as we are con- 

cerned, a question tackled, later on and in private, only by   

Strether himself. He was to reflect later on and in private 

that it was mainly ke who had explained — as he had had, ;l 

moreover, comparatively little difficulty in doing. He was ? 

to have, at all events, meanwhile, the worrying thought of 

their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having plotted   

this coincidence, taking such pains as might be to give it 

the semblance of an accident. That possibility — as their 

imputation — didn't, of course, bear looking into for an 'i 

instant ; yet the whole incident was so manifestly, arrange 

it as they would, an awkward one, that he could scarce ! 

keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from 

rising to his lips. Disclaimers of intention would have 

been as tactless as his presence was, practically, gross ; and 

the narrowest escape any one of them had was his lucky 

escape, in the event, from so blundering. Nothing either a 

like a challenge or like an apology was, so far as surface ' 

and sound were involved, even in question ; surface and 

sound all made for their common ridiculous good fortune, l 

for the general invraiscmblance of the occasion, for the 

charming chance that they had, the others, in passing, ; 

ordered some food to be ready, the charming chance that ; 

he had himself not eaten, the charming chance, even more,  

that their little plans, their hours their train, in short,  





from Id-bas, would all match for their return together to 
Paris. The chance that was most charming of all, the 
chance that drew from Mme. de Vionnet her clearest, 
gayest " Covime cela se trouve ! " was the announcement 
made to Strether after they were seated at table, the word 
given him by their hostess in respect to his carriage for 
ithe station, on which he might now count. It settled the 
j matter for his friends as well ; the conveyance — it was all 
too lucky ! — would serve for them ; and nothing was more 
delightful than his being in a position to make the train 
so definite. It might have been, for themselves — to hear 
, Mme. de Vionnet — almost unnaturally vague, a detail left 
to be fixed, though Strether indeed was afterwards to 
remember that Chad had promptly enough intervened to 
forestall this appearance, laughing at his companion's 
flightiness and making the point that he had, after all, in 
spite of the bedazzlement of a day out with her, known 
what he was about. 

Strether was to remember afterwards, further, that this 
had had for him the effect of forming Chad's almost sole 
intervention ; and indeed he was to remember further still, 
in subsequent meditation, many things that, as it were, 
fitted together. Another of them was, for instance, that 
the wonderful woman's overflow of surprise and amuse- 
ment was wholly into French, which she struck him as 
speaking with an unprecedented command of idiomatic 
turns, but in which she got, as he might have said, some- 
what away from him, taking all at once little brilliant 
jumps that he could but lamely match. The question of 
his own French had never come up for them ; it was the 
one thing she wouldn't have permitted — it belonged, for a 
person who had been through much, to mere boredom ; 
but the present result was odd, fairly veiling her identity, 
shifting her back into the mere voluble class or race 
with whose intense audibility he had by this time made 
his terms. When she spoke the charming, slightly strange 
English he best knew her by, he seemed to feel her as a 
creature, among all the millions, with a language quite to 
herself, the real monoply of a special shade of speech, 
beautifully easy for her, yet of a colour and a cadence 
that were both inimitable and matters of accident. She 





came back to these things after they had shaken down, 
the inn-parlour and knew, as it were, what was to becom< 
of them ; it was inevitable that mere ejaculation over th«j 
prodigy of their convergence should at last wear itself out   
Then it was that his impression took fuller form — th<' 
impression, destined only to deepen, to complete itselj   
that they had something to put a face upon, to carry ot) 
and make the best of, and that it was she v/ho, admirabb ( 
on the whole, was doing this. It was familiar to him o  
course that they had something to put a face upon ; thei  
friendship, their connection, took any amount of explain 
ing — that would have been made familiar by his twent    
minutes with Mrs. Pocock if it hadn't already been sc 
Only, his theory, as we know, had bountifully been tha 
the facts were, specifically, none of his business, and were ; 
over and above, so far as one had to do with them, intrinsi ( 
cally beautiful ; and this might have prepared him fo 
anything, as well as rendered him proof against mystifica   
tion. When he reached home that night, however, hi ? 
knew he had been, at bottom, neither prepared nor proof   
and since we have spoken of what he was, after his return 
to recall and interpret, it may as well immediately be sai(   
that his real experience of these few hours put on, in tha 
belated vision — for he scarce went to bed till morning— . 
the aspect that is most to our purpose. « 

He then knew more or less how he had been affected— 
he but half knew at the time. There had been plenty to ( 
affect him even after, as has been said, they had shaker! 
down ; for his consciousness, though muffled, had iti 
sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop intcj 
innocent, friendly Bohemia. They then had put theiii 
elbows on the table, deploring the premature end of their 
two or three dishes; which they had tried to make upj 
with another bottle while Chad joked a little spasmodically. I 
perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess. What, 
it all came to had been that fiction and fable zi'Cfr, inevit-i 
ably, in the air, and not as a simple term of comparison, 
but as a result of things said ; also that they were blinking 
it, all round, and that they yet needn't, so much as that, I 
have blinked it — though positively if they hadn't Strether« 
didn't quite see what else they could have done. Strether  





didn't quite see that even at an hour or two past midnight, 
even when he had, at his hotel, for a long time, without a 
light and without undressing, sat back on his bedroom sofa 
and stared straight before him. He was, at that point of 
vantage, in full possession, to make of it all what he could. 
He kept making of it that there had been simply a lie in 
the charming affair — a lie on which one could now, de- 
tached and deliberate, perfectly put one's finger. It was 
with the lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and 
laughed, that they had waited for their carriole rather 
impatiently, and had then got into the vehicle and, sensibly 
subsiding, driven their three or four miles through the
