At this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand. 
Sat down to listen, I suppose. Never mind 
what he heard, I stopped apostrophi sing 
and convinced him 
that I was not a man 
to allow contempt of 
Court on the part of 
a horse. I broke the back -bone of a Chief 
over his rump and 
set out to join the 
cavalcade again. 



Very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 
9 o'clock at night, myself in the lead — for when my horse 
finally came to understand that he was homeward bound and 
hadn't far to go, he turned his attention strictly to business. 

This is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information. 

There is no regular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in any 
part of the kingdom of Hawaii ; therefore unless you are acquaint- 
ed with wealthy residents (who all have good horses), you must 
hire animals of the wretchedest description from the Kanakas, 
(i. e. natives.) Any horse you hire, even though it be from a white 
man, is not often of much account, because it will be brought 
in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been leading 
a hard life. If the Kanakas who have been caring for him 
(inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death 
every day themselves, you can depend upon it they have been 
doing the same thing by proxy, by clandestinely hiring him 
out. At least, so I am informed. The result is, that no horse 
has a chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or look well or feel 
well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as I was 
to-day. 

In hiring a horse from a Kanaka, you must have all your 
eyes about you, because you can rest satisfied that you are dealing 
with a shrewd unprincipled rascal. You may leave your door 
open and your trunk unlocked as long as you please, and he 
will not meddle with your property ; he has no important vices 
and no inclination to commit robbery on a large scale ; but if 
he can get ahead of you in the horse business, he will take a 
genuine delight in doing it. This trait is characteristic of horse 
jockeys, the world over, is it not ? He will overcharge you if 
he can ; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night (an}- 
body's — may be the King's, if the royal steed be in conve- 
nient view), and bring you the mate to my Oahu in the morn- 
ing, and contend that it is the same animal. If you make trou- 
ble, he will get out by saying it was not himself who made 
the bargain with you, but his brother, "who went out in the 
country this morning." They have always got a " brother " to 
shift the responsibility upon. A victim said to one of these fel- 
lows one day : 

" But I know I hired the horse of you, because I noticed 
that scar on your cheek.'' 



The reply was not bad : " Oh, yes — yes — my brother all 
same — we twins !" 

A friend of mine, J. Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the 

Kanada warranting him to be in excellent condition. Smith 
had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the Kan- 
aka to put these on the horse. The Kanaka protested that he 
was perfectly willing to trust the gentleman with the saddle 
that was already on the animal, but Smith refused to use it. 
The change was made ; then Smith noticed that the Kanaka 
had only changed the saddles, and had left the original blanket 
on the horse ; he said he forgot to change the blankets, and so, 
to cut the bother short, Smith monnted and rode away. The 
horse went lame a mile from town, and afterward got to cutting 
up some extraordinary capers. Smith got down and took off 
the saddle, but the blanket stuck fast to the horse — glued to a 

procession of raw places. 
The Kanaka's mysterious 
conduct stood explained. 

Another friend of mine 
bouglit a pretty good horse 
from a native, a day or two 
ago, after a tolerably thorough examination of the 
animal. He discovered today that the horse was as 
blind as a bat, in one eye. 
He meant to have examined 
that eye, and came honje with a general notion that he 
had done it ; but he remembers now that every time he made the attempt his attention 
was called to something else by his victimizer. 

One more instance, and then I will pass to something else. 
I am informed that when a certain Mr. L., a visiting stranger, was 
here, he bought a pair of very respectable-looking match horses 
from a native. They were in a little stable with a partition 
through the middle of it — one horse in each apartment. Mr. 
L. examined one of them critically through a window (the 
Kanaka's " brother" having gone to the country with the key), 
and then went around the house and examined the other through 
a window on the other side. He said it was the neatest match 
he had ever seen, and paid for the horses on the spot. "Where- 
upon tlic Kanaka departed to join his brother in the country. 
The fellow had shamefully swindled L. There was only one 
" match " horse, and he had examined his starboard side through 
one window and his port side through another ! I decline to 
believe this story, but I give it because it is worth something 
as a fanciful illustration of a fixed fact — namely, that the Kanaka 
horse-jockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience. 
You can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars, 
and a good enough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars 
and a half. I estimate " Oahu" to be worth somewhere in 
the neighborhood of thirty-five cents. A good deal better animal 
than he is was sold here day before yesterday for a dollar and sev- 
enty-five cents, and sold again to-day for two dollars and twenty- 
five cents ; Williams bought a handsome and lively little pony yesterday
for ten dollars ; and about the best common horse on the 
island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with Mexican 
saddle and bridle, for seventy dollars — a horse which is well and 
widely known, and greatly respected for his speed, good disposition
and everlasting bottom. You give your horse a little grain 
once a day ; it comes from San Francisco, and is worth about 
two cents a pound ; and you give him as much hay as he wants ; it 
is cut and brought to the market by natives, and is not very good 
it is baled into long, round bundles, about the size of a large 
man; one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a six 
foot pole, and the Kanaka slioulders the pole and walks about 
the streets between the upright bales in search of customers. 
These hay bales, thus carried, have a general resemblance to a 
colossal capital H. 

The hay-bundles cost twenty-five cents apiece, and one will 
last a horse about a day. You can get a horse for a song, a 
week's hay for another song, and you can turn your animal loose 
among the luxuriant grass in your neighbor's broad front yard 
without a song at all — you do it at midnight, and stable the 
beast again before morning. You have been at no expense thus 
far, but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will cost 
you from twenty to thirty-five dollars. You can hire a horse, 
saddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week, and the 
owner will take care of them at his own expense. 

It is time to close this day's record — bed time. As I prepare 
for sleep, a rich voice rises out of the still night, and, far as this 
ocean rock is toward the ends of the earth, I recognize a famil- 
iar home air. But the words seem somewhat out of joint : 

*' Waikiki lantoni oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo."
