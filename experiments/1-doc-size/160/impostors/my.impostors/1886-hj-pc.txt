would not fail to produce Madame Grandoni some day, 
Hyacinth (though he doubted whether the presentation 
would really take place) guessed how much she wished her 
old friend might have heard the strange bedizened little 
invalid make that speech. 

There were only three other seats, for the introduction 
of the sofa (a question so profoundly studied in advance), 
had rendered necessary the elimination of certain articles ; 
so that Muniment, on his feet, hovered round the little 
circle, with his hands in his pockets, laughing freely and 
sociably but not looking at the Princess; though, as Hyacinth 
was sure, he was none the less agitated by her presence. 

' You ought to tell us about foreign parts and the grand 
things you have seen ; except that, doubtless, our dis- 
tinguished visitor knows all about them,' Muniment said to 
Hyacinth. Then he added, ' Surely, at any rate, you have 
seen nothing more worthy of your respect than Camber- 
well.' 

' Is this the worst part ? ' the Princess asked, looking up 
with her noble, interested face. 





' The worst, madam ? What grand ideas you must have ! 
We admire Camberwell immensely.' 

' It's my brother's ideas that are grand ! ' cried Rose 
Muniment, betraying him conscientiously. ' He does want 
everything changed, no less than you, Princess ; though he 
is more cunning than you, and won't give one a handle 
where one can take him up. He thinks all this part most 
objectionable as if dirty people won't always make every- 
thing dirty where they live ! I dare say he thinks there 
ought to be no dirty people, and it may be so ; only if every 
one was clean, where would be the merit ? You would get 
no credit for keeping yourself tidy. At any rate, if it's a 
question of soap and water, every one can begin by himself. 
My brother thinks the whole place ought to be as handsome 
as Brompton.' 

' Ah, yes, that's where the artists and literary people live, 
isn't it ? ' asked the Princess, attentively. 

' I have never seen it, but it's very well laid out,' Rosy 
rejoined, with her competent air. 

' Oh, I like Camberwell better than that,' said Muniment, 
hilariously. 

The Princess turned to Lady Aurora, and with the air of 
appealing to her for her opinion gave her a glance which 
travelled in a flash from the topmost bow of her large, mis- 
fitting hat to the crumpled points of her substantial shoes. 
' I must get you to tell me the truth,' she murmured. ' I 
want so much to know London the real London. It seems 
so difficult ! ' 

Lady Aurora looked a little frightened, but at the same 
time gratified, and after a moment she responded, ' I 
believe a great many artists live in St. John's Wood.' 



 

' I don't care about the artists ! ' the Princess exclaimed, 
shaking her head, slowly, with the sad smile which some- 
times made her beauty so inexpressibly touching. 

'Not when they have painted you such beautiful pictures?' 
Rosy demanded. ' We know about your pictures we have 
admired them so much. Mr. Hyacinth has described to us 
your precious possessions.' 

The Princess transferred her smile to Rosy, and rested 
it on that young lady's shrunken countenance with the same 
ineffable head-shake. ' You do me too much honour. I 
have no possessions.' 

' Gracious, was it all a make-believe ? ' Rosy cried, flash- 
ing at Hyacinth an eye that was never so eloquent as when 
it demanded an explanation. 

' I have nothing in the world nothing but the clothes 
on my back ! ' the Princess repeated, very gravely, without 
looking at the young man. 

The words struck him as an admonition, so that, though 
he was much puzzled, he made no attempt, for the moment, 
to reconcile the contradiction. He only replied, ' I meant 
the things in the house. Of course I didn't know whom 
they belonged to.' 

' There are no things in my house now,' the Princess 
went on ; and there was a touch of pure, high resignation 
in the words. 

' Laws, I shouldn't like that ! ' Rose Muniment declared, 
glancing, with complacency, over her own decorated walls. 
' Everything here belongs to me.' 

'I shall bring Madame Grandoni to see you,' said the 
Princess, irrelevantly but kindly. 

' Do you think it's not right to have a lot of things 





about ? ' Lady Aurora, with sudden courage, queried of her 
distinguished companion, pointing her chin at her but look- 
ing into the upper angle of the room. 

' I suppose one must always settle that for one's self. I 
don't like to be surrounded with objects I don't care for ; and 
I can care only for one thing that is, for one class of things 
at a time. Dear lady,' the Princess went on, ' I fear I 
must confess to you that my heart is not in bibelots. When 
thousands and tens of thousands haven't bread to put in 
their mouths, I can dispense with tapestry and old china/ 
And her fair face, bent charmingly, conciliatingly, on Lady 
Aurora, appeared to argue that if she was narrow at least 
she was candid. 

Hyacinth wondered, rather vulgarly, what strange turn 
she had taken, and whether this singular picture of her 
denuded personality were not one of her famous caprices, a 
whimsical joke, a nervous perversity. Meanwhile, he heard 
Lady Aurora urge, anxiously, 'But don't you think we 
ought to make the world more beautiful ? ' 

' Doesn't the Princess make it so by the mere fact of her 
existence?' Hyacinth demanded; his perplexity escaping, 
in a harmless manner, through this graceful hyperbole. He 
had observed that, though the lady in question could dis- 
pense with old china and tapestry, she could not dispense 
with a pair of immaculate gloves, which fitted her like a 
charm. 

'My people have a mass of things, you know, but I 
have really nothing myself,' said Lady Aurora, as if she 
owed this assurance to such a representative of suffering 
humanity. 

' The world will be beautiful enough when it becomes 



 

good enough/ the Princess resumed. ' Is there anything 
so ugly as unjust distinctions, as the privileges of the few 
contrasted with the degradation of the many? When we 
want to beautify, we must begin at the right end.'
