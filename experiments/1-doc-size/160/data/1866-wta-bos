"To the letter, I said."

"Were you ordered to shoot Mr. Pillgrim?"

"Yes, if necessary."

"Thank'ee, Mr. Somers. You have taken a weight heavier than the best
bower off my stomach. I'd rather be where Jonah was--in the whale's
belly--than see any harm come to you. I feel better now."

"You shall know all about it, Tom, in a few days, or perhaps a few
hours."

"I'm satisfied, Mr. Somers. Shiver my kevel-heads, but I ought to have
been satisfied with anything you do."

By this time the steamer came up with the Chatauqua, and both vessels
stopped their engines, as the Ben Nevis rounded to under the stern of
the man-of-war.

"Chatauqua, ahoy!" shouted Somers.

"On board the prize!" replied the officer of the deck.

"Send the surgeon on board, if you please."

"Ay, ay."

In a few moments the third cutter, in charge of Mr. Transit, the master,
put off from the ship, with Dr. De Plesion on board.

"Where is Mr. Pillgrim, sir?" asked the master of Somers.

"Wounded, below."

"Mr. Hackleford wishes your report forthwith on board the ship."

"Mr. Transit, Mr. Pillgrim is under arrest. You will permit no one to
communicate with him except the surgeon."

"Under arrest!" exclaimed Mr. Transit.

"I have no time to explain," replied Somers, as he directed his coxswain
to pipe down his boat's crew.

When the second cutter was hauled up to the accommodation ladder, Somers
stepped on board, and a few moments later, touched his hat to the first
lieutenant on the quarter deck of the Chatauqua.

"I have to report that I have captured the Ben Nevis," said Somers.

"Where is Mr. Pillgrim?" asked Mr. Hackleford, the captain standing by,
an interested and excited listener.

"He is wounded, and under arrest, sir."

"How wounded?"

"He fired at me, and in self-defence I was obliged to shoot him. I think
he is not seriously wounded. He boarded the Ben Nevis, and had given the
captain of her permission to proceed, though the vessel was headed
towards Cape Fear."

"You have done well, Mr. Somers," said Captain Cascabel. "Beat to
quarters, Mr. Hackleford."

When the crew were at quarters, Mr. Hackleford explained to them what
had occurred, and fully justified the course of the fourth lieutenant;
whereupon an earnest and enthusiastic cheer rang through the ship.

"Are you satisfied, Tom?" asked Somers of the boatswain.

"Bless ye! I was satisfied before, Mr. Somers. There is only one dark
thing in the whole of it."

"What's that, Tom?"

"If Captain Cascabel and Mr. Hackleford both knew that Mr. Pillgrim was
a traitor, why did they send him out to capture that steamer? That's
what I can't see through."

"Can't you? Well, if they had not sent him, we should not have captured
the Ben Nevis."

"I don't see why."

"Don't you? Well, you are not as sharp as you are sometimes."

"I know I'm dull, Mr. Somers, but splinter my figger head if I can see
through it."

"The Ben Nevis is good for fifteen knots at least."

"I know that; she did it while we were coming up."

"The Chatauqua can't make more than twelve."

"That's true."

"Then, of course, the Chatauqua could not catch the Ben Nevis."

"That's clear enough. But we were out in the boats, and were close
aboard of her."

"And just then she sheered off. Could the boats have overhauled her?"

"Sartinly not; but you could have put a shot through her hull."

"Which might, at that distance, have disabled her, and might not. The
chances were all against us. But the moment Mr. Pillgrim hailed her, and
swung his cap, she stopped her wheels. They knew very well he would not
detain her."

"I see now."

"Probably the captain of the Ben Nevis knew the Chatauqua, and knew that
Pillgrim was on board of her, and they were on the lookout for him. If
any other officer than myself had been in the second cutter, I am
satisfied Mr. Pillgrim would not have returned to his boat, but would
have staid on board the Ben Nevis."

"He's a horrible villain--arn't he?" said the honest boatswain.

This conversation took place while Captain Cascabel was preparing his
despatches to be sent by the prize steamer to the navy department. When
they were completed, Somers was sent for, and he repaired at once to the
captain's cabin.

"Mr. Somers, though I can hardly spare you, I feel compelled to send you
home as prize master in the Ben Nevis. I have commended you to the
department," said Captain Cascabel, as he handed him the despatches.

"Thank you, sir."

A prize crew was at once detailed, with two master's mates to act as
first and second officers, and a corporal and three marines to guard the
prisoner who was to be sent back in the prize. Somers bade a hasty good
by to his brother officers, and with his crew was sent on board the Ben
Nevis, whose deck he was now to tread for a brief period as her
commander. His orders required him to take the Ben Nevis to Fortress
Monroe, and there communicate with the navy department.

"Well, doctor, how is your patient?" asked Somers, when he reached the
deck of the prize.

"He will do very well. If you had put the bullet half an inch nearer his
brain, you would have finished him. The skin is torn off the side of his
head, and I suppose the ball stunned him. He is sitting up now, and
appears to be as well as ever, though in no very amiable frame of mind."

"I suppose not."

"He says you are a rebel and a traitor, and he intends to prove it. I
told him I thought his wound had affected his brain."

"It would require a long story to explain what he means. Mr. Hackleford
has the papers, and I doubt not he will tell you all about it, doctor,"
replied Somers, as he proceeded to arrange for the return voyage.

All who were not going home in the Ben Nevis were sent back to the
