summer I mean to take a real vacation. I shall 
spend it nearly all in the garden. I do begin to 
envy you and Larry." 

" We shall make you welcome in the garden," I 
returned, with a quick beat of the heart. 

"Do you know," Celia said, turning her sweet 
face to me, " that I am so glad and thankful that 
Lawrence is going to be settled here? And he is 
growing stronger. Oh! do you remember the first 
time I walked up this hill with you ? How strangely 
events get shaped, just by a chance word ! " 

Would they shape themselves to my desire, I 
wondered. She seemed so much nearer, so infinitely 
dear, in these worn and tired moods. I wanted to 


stretch out my arms and take her for all time. If 
my new plans worked well 

We could not do a great deal at this season of 
the year, but Lawrence and I spent our spare 
moments in " straightening up." We altered some 
things in our greenhouse, and began to hurry the 
other to completion. Many of the young trees and 
shrubs looked poorly. We decided not to buy 
much, but to bring all the cuttings we could from 
my house. We would make the ground profitable 
in this manner until we saw our way clear to do 
something else with it. 

" One could easily build a house at the upper 
end," Hildreth said. " I do not suppose we shall 
even want two acres in greenhouses. But what a 
superb place for graperies ! Really, one almost 
wishes for thousands to invest; but we must not 
rush on too fast, rather take warning by our 
young friend's over-ambitious schemes." 

It was a lovely plot of ground, and Mr. Teall's 
two houses were very handsome. He proposed to 
build two more on the avenue, and was much 
pleased with the hotel project. 

It was a week after this, I think, that Mr. Benson 
and his son Walter came out. The lad was small 
and fragile-looking, with one high shoulder. There 
had been a wrench to the spine, but it was not a pos- 



 

itive hump-back. He was fair, with a sweet, almost 
imploring face ; and somehow my heart went out to 
him at once. 

I took him through my chicken-yards. We had 
hatched out one hundred and twenty-three chickens 
this year, and had already used a good many. My 
Leghorns had been culled of every thing not quite 
true, and they were a handsome lot. They and 
some games were all that I kept separate. The 
young chicks were in a yard by themselves, and the 
hens in another, about thirty-seven extremely hand 
some fowls. I explained to him very freely my ex 
periments and successes. I had not done it on a 
purely business basis, but I saw how it could be car 
ried forward to a considerable profit. 

" It would be good to have more land," said Mr. 
Benson. " I wonder if one could buy some of that 
lying above." 

The remark startled me. 

" If my son should make such a venture, I should 
want him to have a chance of success. It seems as 
if one ought to be able to do the work he is inter 
ested in, and there are things that would be much 
too wearing for Walter." 

" I mean to try the experiment somewhere," said 
the lad. "And this is such a lovely place ! I do 
not like real country ; that is, large farms with houses 



 

ever so far apart. What a nice show of fruit ! " and 
he glanced around. "Can you sell any of it?" 

I told him I had sold both fruit and berries. 

" Do you suppose, now, that a young fellow could 
make his living on a place like this well, by 
branching out a little ? " asked Mr. Benson. 

" One young fellow certainly could. I have not 
given half my time to it, and it was very much run 
down when I came." 

"You have matters in excellent shape. Now, 
Walter, do you imagine you have as much genius as 
Mr. Thurston ? " 

" This is my first attempt," I said. " I did not 
suppose I had any special genius for farming. I 
should not hesitate to undertake it on a larger 
scale." 

" Is that your purpose ? " 

" Not exactly. I am to try raising flowers with a 
friend." 

" You have a splendid showing here ; " and he 
glanced about. "Will you take us through the 
house ? Isn't five thousand pretty steep fox a place 
like this?" and he turned rather sharply upon 
me. 

" It is in excellent order, and there is" a great deal 
that can be made profitable all the time," I said, 
with a show of being indifferent ; " and I really had 



 

not thought of selling it until Mr. Pryor mentioned 
you." 

Walter was really enchanted with the interior. I 
think Mr. Benson was very much pleased. He 
asked about the water and the drains, and inspected 
the cellar. Every thing was as neat as a pin. 

Afterward I walked down to the station with 
them, and was a little amused by the backward 
looks they bestowed. 

" We shall want a little time to think this over ! " 
exclaimed Mr. Benson. " Walter may run up some 
day by himself, if you have no objection." 

I said he would be welcome at any time. 

Eve came down an hour later to walk up home 
with me. 

" What did those people want? " she asked. " My 
mind misgave me. They had a sort of buying-look." 

" Would you sell under any circumstances ? " and 
I looked her square in the eyes.
