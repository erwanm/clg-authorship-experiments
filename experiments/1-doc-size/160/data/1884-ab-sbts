had fallen in love with some one who proved to be 
divorced, and her family declared she shouldn't marry 
him. They had worked on her feelings and con- 
science, so that the poor little thing was afraid it 
wouldn't be right for her to be his wife." 
" What did you tell her ? " 



 

" I told her that if she loved him and believed lu 
him, she'd no business to give him up for such a 
reason ; that the fact of having been deceived in 
another woman was his misfortune. And I saw the 
family and reasoned till they yielded. The little 
thing and her husband have gone West. They went 
the day you came." 

' Suppose his wife, the first one, had not been what 
he thought, and was happier without him. In fact, 
suppose the marriage to have been really null, though 
for some reason they couldn't or wouldn't ask for a 
divorce, would you advise her to love him then ? " 

[ Yes," said Victoria, gravely. ' That is, if I were 
sure they had large natures and could love greatly 
enough to be true. Human sanctions would weigh 
for nothing with me, either in marriage or divorce." 

Oswald felt a glowing intoxication of triumph. So, 
gaining her love was to be all ! 

Victoria was at the image-breaking period of a ques- 
tioning mind. Her own large truth and purity of 
heart made her intolerant of all bonds, but spiritual 
ones. She was so young, too, that she scorned the 
conventional aspect of great questions. 

At the moment, Oswald had in his pocket an 
unread letter from his wife. It was only as great a 
drawback on his happiness as the coming of a bill may 
be to a man who knows he shall be able to meet it 
somehow and sometime. That night he read it, with 
some admiration for Elizabeth's common-sense. She 
wrote quietly, with solicitous interest in the happiness 
of his summer, asking when he would be at home or 
in Stratford. She should be very glad to see him 



 

there ; the sky and sea were the same. It was a letter 
which would have driven a husband in love or still 
loving, to take the next train for Stratford, to woo his 
wife over again. But its tone seemed to Oswald 
deserving only of reward, and he wrote her a brightly 
affectionate answer, that very night. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

"HOLKS talks a good deal about 'Lizabeth Craig," 
JL said Mrs. Potter, looking up placidly from her 
knitting, at Felix. " Too bad, ain't it ? " 

" Talk about her ? How ? " 

' Oh, they say her husband wasn't good to her, and 
she's left him, V more things 'n' I can think of. But 
there ain't a voice against 'Lizabeth." 

" Well, I should think not ! Nor her husband, 
'either," he added, with an impulse of diplomacy. " I 
know him, and nobody could be brighter or more 
entertaining than he is." 

" There ! ' said the little widow, in her comfortable 
voice. " To think there should be such things said ! 
But folks thinks it's strange she come home alone, and 
Jerry says there don't no letters go between 'em." 

: Jerry is far too communicative on the subject of 
the mail, I should say. Why, Mrs. Potter, Craig 
went to Grand Man an, with an artist, for sketching. It 
will be a great benefit to him ; think of the scenery 
and climate and queer people ! ' 

Felix could scarcely repress an inclination to call 
her attention to his stroke of policy. A man who 
seldom works with a purpose to deceive is likely to do 
it by the wholesale, and frankly admire himself after the 
effort. 

" Do tell ! ' said Mrs. Potter, in benign apprecia- 



 

tion. ' Do they have all that up there ? I should 
think board must be high." 

Felix rose, feeling that any further enlargement on 
the subject might induce his hostess to tell the next 
comer that Mr. Craig had gone to hunt hippogriffs or 
convert anacondas. After that, he was careful to al- 
lude frequently and familiarly to Oswald, for the bene- 
fit of Stratford ears. This was somewhat to Elizabeth's 
wonder, but she understood it, finally. Susan Fitts 
came in, ostensibly to call, but it was fair to suppose 
she had an errand. All the family knew her well 
enough to be sure of that ; nobody resented the fact 
as belligerently as did Grandmother. 

You goin' back this fall, 'Lizabeth'? '" with a suav- 
ity, the effect of which was quite counteracted by her 
small, watchful eyes. 

' Oh yes, indeed, some time in the fall." 

' I thought maybe you wa'n't, from somethin' that 
was said to me." Silence followed. Elizabeth looked 
up, politely attentive, and, with no idea that there was 
reason for her being uncomfortable, waited for some 
one to start up the conversation. She never could 
think of topics both agreeable and correct for discus- 
sion with Miss Fitts. Most subjects were unsafe, un- 
less one wanted to hear scandal. But Susan went on 
unaided. " Somebody says to me this mornin', ' I guess 
'Lizabeth didn't like Boston as well as she expected 
to.' Then, indeed, poor Elizabeth scented the battle. 
Grandmother headed the charge to the rescue. 

' Susan Fitts, didn't I tell you once that them that 
would fetch a bone would carry one ? Now, here's 
one for you to carry. You can tell any body that's 



 

anxious to know any thing about Elizabeth's husband, 
to come to me. I'll settle 'em ! ' 

" Lor', Mis' Nye, how quick you be ' ' said the at- 
tacking force, in a conciliatory manner signifying 
truce, though her eyes flashed a little and a flush rose 
to her cheek-bones. " I didn't mean a thing out o' the 
way." 

" No," said Grandmother. " I believe that. Gossip 
has come to be your meat and drink You don't know 
when you do it any more than Job Haddon knows 
when he's drunk ! ' 

" If you come to twittin' honest women of bein' 
drunk, Mis' Nye, it's time somebody told you what's
