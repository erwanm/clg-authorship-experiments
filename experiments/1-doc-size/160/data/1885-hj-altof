pledge, and who bequeathed the duty to her son. He 
died shortly afterwards, and his widow assumed the 
pious task. According to Murray, she intrusted the 
erection of the church to "Maistre Loys von Berghem," 
and the sculpture to "Maistre Conrad." The author 
of a superstitious but carefully prepared little Notice, 
which I bought at Bourg, calls the architect and 





sculptor (at once) Jehan de Paris, author (sic) of the 
tomb of Francis II. of Brittany, to which we gave some 
attention at Nantes, and which the writer of my 
pamphlet ascribes only subordinately to Michel Colomb. 
The church, which is not of great size, is in the last 
and most flamboyant phase of Gothic, and in admirable 
preservation; the west front, before which a quaint old 
sun-dial is laid out on the ground, a circle of num 
bers marked in stone, like those on a clock face, let 
into the earth, is covered with delicate ornament. 
The great feature, however (the nave is perfectly bare 
and wonderfully new-looking, though the warden, a 
stolid yet sharp old peasant, in a blouse, who looked 
more as if his line were chaffering over turnips than 
showing off works of art, told me that it has never 
been touched, and that its freshness is simply the 
quality of the stone), the great feature is the ad 
mirable choir, in the midst of which the three monu 
ments have bloomed under the chisel, like exotic 
plants in a conservatory. I saw the place to small 
advantage, for the stained glass of the windows, which 
are fine, was under repair, and much of it was masked 
with planks. 

In the centre lies Philibert-le-Bel, a figure of white 
marble on a great slab of black, in his robes and his 
armor, with two boy-angels holding a tablet at his 
head, and two more at his feet. On either side of 
him is another cherub: one guarding his helmet, the 
other his stiff gauntlets. The attitudes of these charm 
ing children, whose faces are all bent upon him in 



  

pity, have the prettiest tenderness and respect. The 
table on which he lies is supported by elaborate 
columns, adorned with niches containing little images, 
and with every other imaginable elegance; and be 
neath it he is represented in that other form, so com 
mon in the tombs of the Renaissance, a man naked 
and dying, with none of the state and splendor of the 
image above. One of these figures embodies the duke, 
the other simply the mortal; and there is something 
very strange and striking in the effect of the latter, 
seen dimly and with difficulty through the intervals 
of the rich supports of the upper slab. The monu 
ment of Margaret herself is on the left, all in white 
marble, tormented into a multitude of exquisite pat 
terns, the last extravagance of a Gothic which had 
gone so far that nothing was left it but to return upon 
itself. Unlike her husband, who has only the high 
roof of the church above him, she lies under a canopy 
supported and covered by a wilderness of embroidery, 
flowers, devices, initials, arabesques, statuettes. 
Watched over by cherubs, she is also in her robes 
and ermine, with a greyhound sleeping at her feet 
(her husband, at his, has a waking lion); and the 
artist has not, it is to be presumed, represented her 
as more beautiful than she was. She looks, indeed, 
like the regent of a turbulent realm. Beneath her 
couch is stretched another figure, a less brilliant 
Margaret, wrapped in her shroud, with her long hair 
over her shoulders. Round the tomb is the battered 
iron railing placed there originally, with the myste- 





rious motto of the duchess worked into the top, 
fortune inf or tune fort une. The other two monuments 
are protected by barriers of the same pattern. That 
of Margaret of Bourbon, Philibert 's mother, stands on 
the right of the choir; and I suppose its greatest dis 
tinction is that it should have been erected to a 
mother-in-law. It is but little less florid and sump 
tuous than the others; it has, however, no second re 
cumbent figure. On the other hand, the statuettes 
that surround the base of the tomb are of even more 
exquisite workmanship: they represent weeping wo 
men, in long mantles and hoods, which latter hang 
forward over the small face of the figure, giving the 
artist a chance to carve the features within this holloAv 
of drapery, an extraordinary play of skill. There is 
a high, white marble shrine of the Virgin, as extra 
ordinary as all the rest (a series of compartments, re 
presenting the various scenes of her life, with the 
Assumption in the middle); and there is a magnifi 
cent series of stalls, which are simply the intricate 
embroidery of the tombs translated into polished oak. 
All these things are splendid, ingenious, elaborate, 
precious; it is goldsmith 's work on a monumental 
scale, and the general effect is none the less beautiful 
and solemn because it is so rich. But the monuments 
of the church of Brou are not the noblest that one 
may see; the great tombs of Verona are finer, and 
various other early Italian work. These things are 
not insincere, as Ruskin would say; but they are pre 
tentious, and they are not positively na ifs. I should 



  

mention that the walls of the choir are embroidered 
in places with Margaret 's tantalizing device, which 
partly, perhaps, because it is tantalizing is so very 
decorative, as they say in London. I know not whether 
she was acquainted with this epithet; but she had 
anticipated one of the fashions most characteristic of 
our age. 

One asks one 's self how all this decoration, this 
luxury of fair and chiselled marble, survived the 
French Revolution. An hour of liberty in the choir 
of Brou would have been a carnival for the image- 
breakers. The well-fed Bressois are surely a good- 
natured people. I call them well-fed both on general 
and on particular grounds. Their province has the 
most savory aroma, and I found an opportunity to 
test its reputation. I walked back into the town from 
the church (there was really nothing to be seen by 
the way), and as the hour of the midday breakfast 
had struck, directed my steps to the inn. The table 
d hote was going on, and a gracious, bustling, talkative 
landlady welcomed me. I had an excellent repast 
the best repast possible which consisted simply of 
boiled eggs and bread and butter. It was the quality 
of these simple ingredients that made the occasion 
memorable. The eggs were so good that I am ashamed 
to say how many of them I consumed. "La plus 
belle fille du monde," as the French proverb says, 
"ne peut donner que ce qu elle a;" and it might 
seem that an egg which has succeeded in being fresh 
has done all that can reasonably be expected of it, 





But there was a bloom of punctuality, so to speak, 
about these eggs of Bourg, as if it had been the in 
tention of the very hens themselves that they should 
be promptly served. "Nous sommes en Bresse, et le 
beurre n est pas mauvais," the landlady said, with a 
sort of dry coquetry, as she placed this article before
