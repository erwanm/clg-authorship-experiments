rey in order, but he wouldn’t take them out to-day 
— maybe that wasn’t quite a Sunday treat. He 
wanted them to have some fun when they had the 
ride. 

Just as he was going to call to Dan he espied 
two gentlemen coming up the street. They were 


 


about of a size, one a little stouter than the other; 
they had the nattiest of gray cloth suits, the 
smoothest of high silk hats, and each carried a 
gold-headed cane. They paused, then with a half 
nod came up his walk, and he knew they 
were the bachelor brothers, Peter and Ira Con- 
sadine. 

“ Good-afternoon,’’ began Peter, who was the 
stouter one, and not very stout either, only Ira 
was a little thinner. They both had that curious, 
well-preserved look as if they had been laid away 
in spices but had not quite reached the mummy 
stage. 

“ Good-afternoon, Mr. Mann. I’ve been saying 
to Ira for a month or more we must be neigh- 
borly ” 

“ Yes, we must be neighborly,” re-echoed Ira. 

“ We’re not the kind to rush headlong into an 
acquaintance. It’s best to go slowly, to learn what 
kind of person your neighbor is likely to be, for 
you know there are people you never can fra- 
ternize with.” 

“ That you never can fraternize with,” added 
Ira. 

“ And I said : ' We’ll see how they keep the 
place.’ We are very neat people, Mr. Mann, and I 
must say Linden Avenue is a street to be proud 


 

of. All the tenants are of the refined and better 
class.” 

They had ascended the porch steps by this time. 
There were some large armchairs, and Mr. Mann 
said, “ Will you walk in or sit out here? ” 

“ Oh, out here. We are great believers in pure 
air. It is bad enough to be housed up all winter, 
though we endeavor to have every room thor- 
oughly aired every day. But it seems more social 
to be out of doors in the summer; ‘there is such 
a variety.’ The clouds are continually changing, 
the wind moves among the trees, and the branches 
sway never twice alike; and the trees on this ave- 
nue are very fine. We haven’t allowed them to 
be hacked and trained until they are no longer 
the trees God meant them to be, but mere traves- 
ties. Nature knows pretty well what she is about, 
I take it.” 

“ It is a beautiful spot,” remarked Mr. Mann. 

“ Yes. It was a great farm and meadow in 
the time of my ancestors three and four genera- 
tions back. The Consadines settled here more than 
two hundred years ago, and the Bradleys, the Up- 
hams, and the Geers have all married in until they 
were like one great family. They laid out the 
town at Grafton, and in my father’s time much 
of the property was divided, and some thirty years 


 

ago this was planned for gentlemen’s residences, 
people who had retired from business or given up 
their farms, or come from cities for quiet and 
where they could be sure of not having the shoddy 
element jostle them. There is so much of that 
now in the world, sir. Men who began life as 
errand-boys, or ditchers, or what-not, getting rich 
and aping their betters; men who haven’t even a 
grandfather to fall back upon. We try to keep 
clear of that sort of gentry.” 

Mr. Mann was amused. What would they say 
if they knew he had no pedigree to fall back 
upon? 

Then Mr. Peter Consadine gave him quite a 
detailed account of his family, and his forbears in 
England that seemed to go back to William the 
Conqueror. 

“ We have the whole tree down to the present 
time. When you do us the honor to come over you 
will be interested in seeing it, and we have some 
family portraits two hundred years old, and silver 
of Queen Anne’s time. I think we shall donate the 
curiosities to some historical association, seeing we 
are the last of our branch. A man ought to marry 
and have sons to succeed him, but there is such a 
risk in bringing up sons nowadays. One cannot 
approve of modern education. It does not make 


 

gentlemen or gentlewomen. And if you had a son 
that insisted upon going to business or out on 
a ranch to mingle with cowboys, your heart would 
be torn with anguish. So we never quite 
dared ” 

No, we never quite dared. Women are so 
different from the time of our mothers.” 

So the two old gentlemen prosed on, giving this 
one’s and that one’s pedigree and virtues. They 
were not captious gossips; indeed, it seemed 
as if all of their acquaintances were of the 
way-high-up sort and possessed of all possible 
virtues. 

Then they rose to go, and said they had enjoyed 
the call very much, and cordially invited Mr. Mann 
to return it, which was quite a compliment, for 
they had decided if they had not found him ad- 
missible they would not continue the acquaint- 
ance. 

He laughed a little as the two dapper old gen- 
tlemen trotted down the street; but it was too late 
then to go over to the Firths. 

Mr. Mann was at his post early on Monday 
morning. Two of the workmen had kept Sunday 
in such a fashion that they were good for nothing. 
One was very impudent and was discharged. The 
other turned penitent and promised to come the 


 

next morning ‘‘ straight as a string.” Late in the 
afternoon word came from Mr. Ross that was not 
encouraging, so Mr. Mann put his “ shoulder to 
the wheel,” as the saying is, and made it go around 
with a rush. It was well that he understood just 
what was to be done or they would have been in
