carefully. To be honest, I know nothing about them, 
and I will not assume to know anything. I heard from 
authority which I could not suspect of posing for omni- 
science that the English rustics were apt to be very 
depraved, but they may on the other hand be saints 
for all that I can prove against them. They are super- 
stitious, it is said, and there are few villages or old 
houses that have not their tutelary spectres. The be- 
lief in ghosts is almost universal among the people ; as 
I may allow without superiority, for I do not know but 
I believe in them myself, and there are some million of 
American spiritualists who make an open profession of 
faith in them. It is said also that the poor in Eng- 
land are much spoiled by the constant aid given them 

 

in charity. This is supposed to corrupt them, and to 
make them dependent upon the favors of fortune, rather 
than the sweat of their brows. On the other hand, they 
often cannot get work, as I infer from the armies of 
the unemployed, and, in these cases, I cannot hold them 
greatly to blame if they bless their givers by their readi- 
ness to receive. If one may infer from the incessant 
beneficences, and the constant demands for more and 
more charities, one heaped upon another, there are more 
good objects in England than anywhere else under the 
sun, for one only gives to good objects, of course. The 
oppression of the subscriptions is tempered by the small- 
ness of the sum which may satisfy them. " Five shil- 
lings is a subscription," said a friend who was accused 
of really always giving five pounds.

The English rich do not give so spectacularly as our 
rich do that is, by handfuls of millions, but then the 
whole community gives more, I think, than our com- 
munity does, and when it does not give, the necessary 
succor is taxed out of its incomes and legacies. I do 
not mean that there is no destitution, but only that 
the better off seem to have the worse off more uni- 
versally and perpetually in mind than with us. All 
this is believed to be very demoralizing to the poor, and 
doubtless the certainty of soup and flannel is bad for 
the soul of an old woman whose body is doubled up 
with rheumatism. The Church seems to blame for 
much of the evil that ensues from giving something to 
people who have nothing ; but I dare say the Dissenters 
are also guilty. 

Just how much is wanted to stay the stomach of a 

 

healthy pauper, it would be hard to say; but now arid 
then the wayfarer gets some hint of the frequency if 
not the amount of feeding among the poor who are 
able to feed themselves. One day, in the outskirts 
they were very tattered and draggled of Liverpool, 
we stopped at a pastry-shop, where the kind woman 
" thought she could accommodate " us with a cup of 
tea, though she was terribly pressed with custom from 
all sorts of minute maids and small boys coming in 
for " penn'orths " of that frightful variety of tart and 
cake which dismays the beholder from innumerable shop 
windows in England. When we were brought our 
safer refection, we noted her activities to the hostess, 
and she said, " Yes, they all want a bit of cake with 
their tea, even the poorest " ; and when we ventured 
our supposition that they made their afternoon tea the 
last meal of the day, she laughed at the notion. " Last 
meal ! They have a good supper before they go to bed. 
Indeed, they all want their four meals a day." 

Another time, thriftily running in a third-class car- 
riage from Crewe to Chester, I was joined by a friend- 
ly man who addressed me with the frank cordiality of 
the lower classes in recognizing one of their sort. 
" They don't know how to charge !" he said, with an 
irony that referred to the fourpence he had been obliged 
to pay for a cup of station tea; and when I tried to 
allege some mitigating facts in behalf of the company, 
he readily became autobiographical. The transition 
from tea to eating generally was easy, and he told 
me that he was a plumber, going to do a job of work 
at Llandudno, where he had to pay fourteen bob, which 
I knew to be shillings and mentally translated into 
$3.50, a week for his board. His wages were $1.50 
a day, which the reader who multiplies fourpence by 
twenty, to make up the difference in money values, 

 

will find to be the wages of a good mechanic in the 
first Edward's time, five hundred years ago. On this 
he professed to live very well. He rose every morning 
at half - past four, and at six he had a breakfast of 
bread, butter, and coffee; at nine he had porridge and 
coffee; at one, he had soup, meat, and eggs, and per- 
haps beer; at night, after he got home from work, he 
had a stew and a bit of meat, and perhaps beer, with 
Mother. He thought that English people ate too much, 
generally, and especially on Sunday, when they had 
nothing else to do. Most men never came home with- 
out asking, " Well, Mother, what have you got for me 
to eat now?" When I remembered how sparely our 
farm people and mechanics fared, I thought that he was 
right, or they were wrong; for the puzzling fact re- 
mained that they looked gaunt and dyspeptic, and he 
hale and fresh, though the difference may have had as 
much to do with the air as the food. I liked him, and 
I cannot leave him without noting that he was of the 
lean-faced, slightly aquiline British type, with a light 
mustache ; he was well dressed and well set up, and he 
spoke strongly, as North Britons do, with nothing of 
our people's husky whine. I found him on further ac- 
quaintance of anti-Chamberlain politics, pro-Boer as to 
the late war, and rather socialistic. He blamed the 
labor men for not choosing labor men to office instead 
of the gentry who offered themselves. He belonged to a 
plumbers' union, and he had nothing to complain of, 
but he inferred that the working-man was better off in 
America, from the fact that none of his friends who 
had gone to the States ever came home to stay, though 
they nearly all came home for a holiday, sooner or 
later. He differed from my other friend, the account- 
ant, in being very fond of the Welsh ; it must be owned 
their race seemed to have acquired merit with him 

 

through the tip of two sovereigns which his last em- 
ployer in Llandudno had given him. On the other 
hand, he had no love for the Italians who were com- 
ing in, especially at Glasgow. In Glasgow, he said, 
there were more drunken women than anywhere else in 
the world, though there was no public-house drinking 
with them as in London. This, so far as I got at it, 
formed his outlook on life, but I dare say there was 
more of it.

I was always regretting that I got at the people so 
little, and that only chance hints of what they were 
thinking and feeling reached me. Now and then, a 
native observer said something about them which seem- 
ed luminous. " We are frightfully feudal," such an 
observer said, " especially the poor." He did not think 
it a fault, I believe, and only used his adverb intensi- 
fyingly, for he was of a Tory mind. He meant the 
poor among the country people, who have at last mas- 
tered that principle of the feudal system which early 
enabled the great nobles to pay nothing for the benefits 
they enjoyed from it. But my other friend, the 
plumber, was not the least feudal, or not so feudal 
as many a lowly ward-heeler in New York, who helps 
to make up the muster of some captain of politics, un- 
der the lead of a common boss. The texture of so-
