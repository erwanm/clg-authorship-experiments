it. Well, perhaps we had better begin with 
something secular, and work round to that." 

So an excursion was arranged for the next 
day. And as Philip walked home, thinking how 
brilliant Evelyn had beea in their little talk, he 
began to dramatize the excursion. 

All excursions are much alike, exhilarating in 
the outset, rarely up to expectation in the object, 
wearisome in the return ; but, nevertheless, de- 
lightful in the memory, especially if attended 
with some hardship or slight disaster. To be 
free, in the open air, and for a day unconven- 
tional and irresponsible, is the suflBlcient justifi- 
cation of a country picnic; but its common at- 
traction is in the opportunity for bringing young 
persons of the opposite sex into natural and un- 
restrained relations. To Philip it was the first 
time in his life that a picnic had ever seemed a 
defensible means of getting rid of a day. 

The two persons to whom this excursion was 
most novel and exciting were Evelyn and the 
elder maiden, Alice, who sat together and speed- 
ily developed a sympathy with each other in the 




 

enjoyment of the country, and in a similar poetic 
temperament, very shy on the part of Alice and 
very frank on the part of Evelyn. The whole 
wild scene along the river was quite as novel to 
Alice as to the city girl, because, although she 
Avas familiar with every mile of it and had driven 
through it a hundred times, she had never in all 
her life before, of purpose, gone to see it. No 
doubt she had felt its wildness and beauty, but 
now for the first time she looked at it as scenery, 
as she might have looked at a picture in a gallery. 
And in the contagion of Evelyn's outspoken en- 
thusiasm she was no longer afraid to give timid 
expression to the latent poetry in her own soul. 
And daring to express this, she seemed to herself 
for the first time to realize vividly the nobility 
and grace of the landscape. And yet there was 
a difference in the appreciation of the two. More 
widely read and travelled, Evelyn's imagination 
took a wider range of comparison and of admira- 
tion, she was appealed to by the large features 
and the grandiose effects ; while Alice noted 
more the tenderer aspects, the wayside flowers 
and bushes, the exotic-looking plants, which she 
longed to domesticate in what might be called 
the Sunday garden on the terraces in front of her 
house. For it is in these little cultivated places 
by the door-step, places of dreaming in the sum- 
mer hours after meeting and at sunset, that the 





 

New England maiden experiences something of 
that tender religious sentiment which was not 
much fed in the barrenness of the Congregational 
meeting-house. 

The Pulpit Rock, in the rough pasture land of 
Zoar, was reached by a somewhat tedious climb 
from the lonely farm-house, in a sheltered nook, 
through straggling woods and gray pastures. It 
was a vast exposed surface rising at a slight 
angle out of the grass and undergrowth. Along 
the upper side was a thin line of bushes, and, 
pushing these aside, the observer was always 
startled at the unexpected scene â€” as it were the 
raising of a curtain upon another world. He 
stood upon the edge of a sheer precipice of a 
thousand feet, and looked down upon a green 
amphitheatre through the bottom of which the 
brawling river, an amber thread in the summer 
foliage, seemed trying to get an outlet from this 
wilderness cul de sac. From the edge of this 
precipice the first impulse was to start back in 
surprise and dread, but presently the observer 
became reassured of its stability, and became 
fascinated by the lonesome wildness of the 
scene. 

"Why is it called Pulpit Eock?" asked Mrs. 
Mavick ; " I see no pulpit." 

" I suppose," said Philip, " the name was nat- 
urally suggested to a religious community, whose 




 

poetic images are mainly Biblical, and who 
thought it an advantageous place for a preacher 
to stand, looking down upon a vast congregation 
in the amphitheatre." 

" So it is," exclaimed Evelyn. " I can see John 
the Baptist standing here now, and hear his voice 
crying in the wilderness." 

" Very likely," said Mrs. Mavick, persisting in 
her doubt, " of course in Zoar. Anywhere else in 
the world it would be called the Lover's Leap." 

" That is odd," said Alice ; " there was a party 
of college girls came here two years ago and 
made up a story about it which was printed, how 
an Indian maiden pursued by a white man ran 
up this hill as if she had been a deer, disappeared 
from his sight through these bushes, and took the 
fatal leap. They called it the Indian Maiden's 
Kock. But it didn't take. It will always be 
Pulpit Eock." 

"So you see, Miss McDonald," said Philip, 
"that writers cannot graft legends on the old 
stock." 

" That depends upon the writer," returned the 
Scotch woman, shortly. " I didn't see the school- 
girl's essay." 

"When the luncheon was disposed of, with the 
usual adaptation to nomadic conditions, and the 
usual merriment and freedom of personal com- 
ment, and the wit that seems so brilliant in the 




 

open air and so flat in print, Mrs. Mavick de- 
clared that she was tired by the long climb and 
the unusual excitement. 

" Perhaps it is the Pulpit," she said ; " but I 
am sleepy, and if you young people will amuse 
yourselves, I will take a nap under that tree." 

Presently, also, Alice and the governess with- 
drew to the edge of the precipice, and Evelyn 
and Philip were left to the burden of entertain- 
ing each other. It might have been an embar- 
rassing situation but for the fact that all the rest
