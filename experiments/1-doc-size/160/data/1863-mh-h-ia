contrast to the dark verdure of the evergreens. Once she 
heard a gun not very far away it seemed in the still, clear 
day but the report did not startle her only as it served 
to awaken more poignant reminiscences than those upon 
which she was meditating when the sharp echo rolled 
through the leafless woods, was caught and repeated by the 
ravines, and died away sullenly among the distant hills. 
Did Aleck ever think of her last hunt ? of the watch she 
had kept beside him in the Greenfield woodlands ? Was 
the scar yet upon his shoulder ? What a cruel wound it 
was ! how fast the blood trickled through her fingers as she 
renewed the compress Robert had applied, when it became 
deranged by the incautious movement of the injured lad! 
Had he forgotten all these things ? Did he hate and despise 
her when he looked at the mark left by the shot ? 

She wished, at times, that he did hate her, and that she 
knew, for certain, that he felt this aversion. Any active 
sentiment would be preferable to his unvarying coldness, his 
studied civility, his constrained address. 

" How little I imagined in the dear old times " 
She did not finish the sentence, but a single tear forced 
its way from under the lid and dropped upon her hand. She 
shed but that one. 





Again, a crow sailed slowly between her and the sun, and 
the shadow crossing the gully, made her look up. He utter 
ed a hoarse croak, just as the shade of his black pinions fell 
upon her brow. 

" A bird of ill-omen !" she thought, languidly. " Portents 
cannot terrify me now ! I am like the man upon the wheel, 
to whom has been mercifully dealt the coup de grace as the 
first blow!" 

Awhile later, she did not trouble herself to think or care 
how long afterwards, there arrived another interruption to 
the sluggish current of ideas. This was the tramp of a horse's 
hoofs, breaking the dry sticks, and rustling the dead leaves 
that strewed the ground under the trees. 

" It will be time enough to move, or take flight, when I 
am seen," was her reflection ; and her indolence or listless- 
ness prompted her to the wisest plan for avoiding discovery. 

The rider was forcing his way through the undergrowth, 
there being not even a bridle-path in that part of the forest. 
It could not be the hunter, whose gun she had heard, for the 
Belleview lands were posted, and no sportsman in the neigh 
borhood was so reckless or intrepid as to trespass upon a 
domain guarded by the law and a master like the proprietor 
of this plantation. It must be Colonel Floyd himself or his 
colored overseer, or, possibly, some other negro belonging 
to the estate, taking a near cut to the house from the main 
road. Yet this would be an unusual procedure. In spiritless 
curiosity, she leaned slightly to one side, wherfe a gap in the 
bushes promised a sight of the equestrian. It was but a 
glimpse, and an imperfect one, which she obtained, the head 
and neck of the horse and the upper part of the rider's body 
only being visible above the high bank. The animal stepped 
proudly, and manifested some symptoms of restiveness, cur 
vetting in such a style as to elicit a sharp reprimand from 
the man who bestrode him- 






" Go on, you fool !" he said, angrily. 

It seemed that a prick of the spur or a cut from a whip 
followed, for the mettled creature gave a forward spring and 
a neigh of pain or viciousness. The human brute was 
Booker, Colonel Floyd's confidential agent. He was looking right ahead, and was, moreover, too busy with his ill- 
mannered steed to notice her. She was glad of this, for his 
intolerable surveillance, and reports based upon it, were not 
confined to the cases of his fellow-servants, as Mrs. Floyd, 
his nominal mistress, had occasionally learned to her sorrow, 
after having covertly transgressed some of the by-laws her 
lord had seen fit, in his sovereign pleasure, to enact for the 
government of the household. Helen disliked the man with 
a heartiness she took no pains to dissemble, and, crafty as he 
was, he had contrived to express to her, at seasonable opportunities, his reciprocation of the antipathy. It was very 
fortunate that he had not descried her, hiding like a lost or 
fugitive thing in that out-of-the-way spot, where no other 
lady of the family or region would ever think of coming. 
Her guardian would otherwise have been supplied with a 
subject for sneering ridicule which he would have improved 
to the utmost advantage, and whenever she least desired its 
introduction. She waited, therefore, where she was, until 
there was no longer any danger of encountering the spy in 
his forest-beat, or of falling in with one she cared still less 
to face, Colonel Floyd. Like hunter and hound, they were 
seldom far apart in their business rounds, by day or by 
night. 

Stiff and chill, from having sat for such a length of time 
upon the ground, she arose with difficulty, climbed the pre 
cipitous side of the ravine ; listened for a moment, to make 
sure that the way was clear, and set out for home. When 
free of the woods, she was surprised to see that the sun had 
passed the meridian. Mrs. Floyd, like Miss Ruth, had ordered an early dinner, and Helen was not so careless of what 
gossiping tongues might say, as wilfully to provoke the 
hubbub of inquiries and teasing observations to which she 
would be subjected, should she be missing from the table 
and the house when the rest were summoned to that repast. 

She found Gabriel at the spring, leisurely filling a pail 
with a gourd. 

" Is dinner nearly ready ?" she asked. 

He jumped up, letting go the gourd, and it splashed back 
into the spring. 

" Oh, is dat you, Miss Helen? How you skeered me !" 

She repeated her question. 

"No, ma 'am, not as I knows on; leastways, marster ain't 
come home, nohow !" 

He raised the pail to his head in a mighty hurry, and 
began his journey up the acclivity towards the house. 

"Has anybody called to see me since I went out?" 
Helen quickened her pace to overtake him. 

" No, ma 'am," walking yet faster. 

"And no letter or message sent that you have heard 
of?" 

" None as I've heerd on, ma 'am !" puffing onwards, the 
water dashing in great streams from the brimming vessel, 
down upon his shoulders and sooty physiognomy. 

" There is no need of such haste, Gabriel !" said Helen, 
smiling, in spite of her heavy heart, at this ostentatious celerity 
in one who had the reputation of being the laziest fellow on 
the place. " I may not have another opportunity of speak 
ing with you alone." 

Gabriel was almost running now, but she kept up with 
him. 

" I want to tell you how sorry poor Sally is for her un* 
kindness to you this morning, and how much I blame her 
for it. She is disposed to be hasty, but she is a good-hearted 




girl, and likes you. I do not want you to bear a grudge
