of the authorities of the land, instead of the suspect, 
homeless and hunted, that he was. He shot out the 
truth, and disdained the results. He startled his 
audience. He made astounding assertions : 



A DECISIVE CRISIS 257 

" This is the work of God," he said. " I am the 
bread of life. . . . He that cometh to me shall 
never be hungry. I came from Heaven, not to do 
mine own will. I came to do the will of Him who 
sent me. . . . He that believeth on me hath ever- 
lasting life. . . . The living Father sent me. . * . 
The words that I speak are spirit and are life." 

So he spoke, commandingly and courageously. 
But his heart was heavy ; so many abandoned him 
suddenly that he felt like a man shunned. Perhaps 
he had not expected this trouble to come so quickly, 
so sorely. He was so loving a man, he depended so 
much on human tenderness, as all highly organized 
souls do, that coldness and desertion almost broke 
his heart. 

One day he turned pitifully to his chosen, the 
twelve, who clung to him while others left him. 

" Will ye also go away ? " he asked with pathetic 
wistfulness. Tears started to his sad eyes. His 
delicate face pleaded with the fishermen, his rough 
friends, as if he cried out to them for something that 
he must have. To their dying hour these men 
remembered that moment, and the time came when 
they thanked God that Peter had answered for them 
all: 

"Master, to whom shall we go? The words of 
eternal life tTiou hast." 

But the public agitation was now so great that 
Jesus found it necessary to escape it for a time. 
He resumed at once his interrupted plans of travel, 
aud went with the twelve towards Tyre and Sidon ; 
a calmer region, where temporary safety allowed him

to continue the work which was more important to 
him than his own fate* 

But there were indications of a certain change in 
him which his followers observed. He had lost 
something of his cheerfulness and ease of manner. 
He grew more grave, more sad. He was much 
alone. He was often absorbed. He sat sunken in 
thought. He knew many sleepless nights. He 
spent his vigils in prayer. He seemed somehow 
removed from his friends by a consciousness of 
trouble untold. At times he looked at them long- 
ingly, lovingly, as if he would have said something 
which yet he never said. He turned away in silence 
which they did not dare to break. His lips parted, 
trembled, and closed. What sorrowful secret did he 
withhold from them ? 



CHAPTER XH 

THE MOUNTAIN: ANI> THE TOMB 

THE time came soon enough when he told them ; 
concealing nothing, revealing all that they could 
understand and more. But he bore his dark secret 
for a while yet, in the loneliness which he had en- 
dured so long that every nerve now began to writhe 
away from it, and his heart to cry for a little human 
comprehension. No man is so sensitive to sympa- 
thy as he who has lived the longest and the most 
strongly without it. The time comes when he must 
have it, -or sink ; the very force of character which 
has enabled him to dispense with it turns again and 
rends an exquisite organization by force of tender- 
ness. The very depth of nature, which has been 
lord of the emergency, now becomes its subject* 
Jesus was approaching such a mental crisis* 

He was now an unpopular wanderer, homeless, 
and in peril. The malice of the church which had 
already excommunicated him was backed by the 
power of the state which hated and feared him. As 
long as the mass of the people supported him, nei- 
ther palace nor Sanhedrin dared resort to extreme 
measures. But the people had begun to desert him. 
He had known their delusive attachment. He was 
to know their caprice and their cruelty. 



260 THE STOEY OF JESUS CHRIST 

The last sir months of His life in Galilee he spent 
as a hunted man, practically an outlaw from the 
more dangerous centres of population; pursuing 
Ms missionary labors as well as he could against 
odds in remote places. Some of the most interest- 
ing work of his life was done in this despairing 
time. He treated the deaf, the dumb, the blind, 
the leper, the maniac, Jews or Gentiles, it mat- 
tered nothing to him, every anguish that needed 
him fed upon him. Dramatic cures and eloquent 
discourses, bountiful mercy and beautiful thought, 
crowded his days. He seemed to press them with 
kindness, with pity to all the world. He gave him- 
self passionately, utterly, to suffering soul or suffer- 
ing body. He lived as great spirits do who know 
that their time is short. But the greatest goes 
dumb before this record of spiritual royalty. 

Yet was he so watched and suspected that he was 
obliged to conceal even his kindnesses, if he could. 
He made many unsuccessful attempts to keep his 
greatest cures as secrets, but the nervous excitement 
of his healed patients prevented this. 

It was one of the special hardships of his life 
that its noblest objects created its gravest dangers. 
The necessity to be silent, to repress, was always 
upon Mm. It took difficult forms. A man living 
to a certain great end, yet was he forced continually 
to withhold its furtherance. About to die for a 
supreme truth, yet he was often obliged to check its 
expression. 

One day at Caesarea Philippi, a significant con- 
versation took place between, himself and his twelve 
friends. 



THE MOUNTAIN : AND THE TOMB 261 

" Whom," he asked suddenly, " do men say that 
Iain?" 

"John the Baptist, or Elijah Jeremiah, or some 
other prophet," was the prompt reply. 

" But whom do ye say ?" persisted the Nazarene. 

Then Peter uttered these memorable words: 
"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." 

" Blessed art thou ! " murmured the Rabbi, much 
moved. "Thou art a rock. I build my church 
upon thee ! "
