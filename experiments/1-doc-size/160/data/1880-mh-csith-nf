Wash, but do not touch with a knife before they are boiled. If cut
while raw, they bleed themselves pale in the hot water. Boil until
tender—if full-grown at least two hours. When done, rub off the skins,
slice round if large, split if young, and butter well in the dish. Salt
and pepper to taste.

A nice way is to slice them upon a hot dish, mix a great spoonful of
melted butter with four or five of vinegar, pepper and salt, heat to
boiling, and pour over the beets.

Instead of consigning the cold ones “left over” to the swill pail, pour
cold vinegar upon them and use as pickles with cold or roast meat.


STEWED BEETS.

Boil young, sweet beets, until nearly done; skin and slice them. Put
into a saucepan with a minced shallot and parsley, two tablespoonfuls
melted butter, a like quantity of vinegar, some salt and pepper. Set on
the fire and simmer twenty minutes, shaking the saucepan now and then.
Serve with the gravy poured over them.


BOILED PARSNIPS.

If young, scrape before cooking. If old, pare carefully, and if large,
split. Put into boiling water, salted, and boil, if small and tender,
from half to three-quarters of an hour, if full-grown, more than an
hour. When tender, drain and slice lengthwise, buttering well when you
dish.


FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Boil until tender, scrape off the skin, and cut in thick lengthwise
slices. Dredge with flour and fry in hot dripping or lard, turning when
one side is browned. Drain off every drop of fat; pepper, and serve hot.


PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Boil tender, mash smooth and fine, picking out the woody bits.
For three large parsnips allow two eggs, one cup rich milk, one
tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful salt, three tablespoonfuls flour.
Beat the eggs light, stir in the mashed parsnips, beating hard; then
the butter and salt, next the milk, lastly the salt. Fry as fritters,
or as griddle-cakes.


MASHED PARSNIPS.

Boil and scrape them, mash smooth with the back of a wooden-spoon, or a
potato beetle, picking out the fibres; mix in three or four spoonfuls
of cream, a great spoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Heat to
boiling in a saucepan, and serve. Heap in a mound as you would potato
cooked in the same way.


BUTTERED PARSNIPS.

Boil tender and scrape. Slice a quarter of an inch thick lengthwise.
Put into a saucepan with three tablespoonfuls melted butter, pepper
and salt, and a little chopped parsley. Shake over the fire until the
mixture boils. Lay the parsnips in order upon a dish, pour the sauce
over them, and garnish with parsley. It is a pleasant addition to this
dish to stir a few spoonfuls of cream into the sauce after the parsnips
are taken out; boil up, and pour upon them.


BOILED SEA-KALE.

Tie up in bunches when you have picked it over carefully, and lay in
cold water for an hour. Put into salted boiling water, and cook twenty
or thirty minutes until tender. Lay some slices of buttered toast
in the bottom of a dish, clip the threads binding the stems of the
sea-kale, and pile upon the toast, buttering it abundantly. Or, you can
send around with it a boat of drawn butter.


STEWED SEA-KALE.

Clip off the stems, wash well, tie in neat bunches, and when it has
lain in cold water an hour or so, put into a saucepan of boiling water,
slightly salted. Boil fifteen minutes, drain well, clip the threads,
and return to the saucepan, with a little rich gravy if you have it.
If not, pour in three or four tablespoonfuls of butter drawn in milk,
pepper and salt, and simmer eight or ten minutes.


ARTICHOKES.

Strip off the outer leaves, and cut the stalks close to the bottom.
Wash well and lay in cold water two hours. Immerse in boiling water,
the stalk-ends uppermost, with an inverted plate upon them to keep them
down. Boil an hour and a half, or until very tender. Arrange in circles
upon a dish, the tops up, and pour drawn butter over them.


SUMMER SQUASH OR CYMBLING.

There are many varieties of this vegetable, but the general rules
for cooking them are the same. Unless they are extremely tender, it
is best to pare them, cutting away as little as possible besides the
hard outer rind. Take out the seeds, when you have quartered them,
and lay the pieces in cold water. Boil until tender throughout. Drain
well, pressing out all the water; mash soft and smooth, seasoning with
butter, pepper, and salt. Do this quickly, that you may serve up hot.


WINTER SQUASH.

Pare, take out the seeds, cut into small pieces, and stew until soft
and tender. Drain, press well, to rid it of all the water, and mash
with butter, pepper, and salt. It will take much longer to cook than
the summer squash, and before you put it into hot water, should lie in
cold at least two hours.


STEWED PUMPKIN.

Cut in two, extract the seeds, slice, and pare. Cover with cold
water for an hour; put over the fire in a pot of boiling water and
stew gently, stirring often, until it breaks to pieces. Drain and
squeeze, rub through a cullender, then return to the saucepan with a
tablespoonful of butter, pepper, and salt to taste. Stir rapidly from
the bottom until very hot, when dish, rounding into a mound, with
“dabs” of pepper on the top.


BAKED PUMPKIN.

Choose the richest pumpkin you can find; take out the seeds, cut in
quarters or eighths, pare, and slice lengthwise half an inch thick.
Arrange in layers—not more than two or three slices deep—in a shallow
but broad baking-dish. Put a very little water in the bottom, and
bake very slowly until not only done, but dry. It requires a long
time, for the heat should be gentle. Butter each strip on both sides
when you dish, and eat hot with bread and butter for tea.

I have been assured, by people who have tried it, that this is a
palatable dish to those who are fond of the flavor of pumpkin. I insert
it here upon their recommendation—not my own.


POKE STALKS.

When the young stalks are not larger than a man’s little finger, and
show only a tuft of leaves at top a few inches above ground, is the
time to gather them. They are unfit for table-use when larger and
older. Scrape the stalks, but do not cut off the leaves. Lay in cold
water, with a little salt, for two hours. Tie in bundles, as you
do asparagus, put into a saucepan of boiling water, and cook fast
three-quarters of an hour. Lay buttered toast in the bottom of a
dish, untie the bundles, and pile the poke evenly upon it, buttering
very well, and sprinkling with pepper and salt. This is a tolerable
substitute for asparagus.


MUSHROOMS.
