I can testify, from experience, that they make a delightful morning
dish, and hereby return thanks to the unknown friend to whom I am
indebted for the receipt.


ASPARAGUS (boiled.)

Cut your stalks of equal length, rejecting the woody or lower portions,
and scraping the white part which remains. Throw into cold water as
you scrape them. Tie in a bunch with soft strings—muslin or tape—and
put into boiling water slightly salted. If very young and fresh, it is
well to tie in a piece of coarse net to protect the tops. Boil from
twenty to forty minutes, according to the age. Just before it is done,
toast two or three slices of bread, cutting off the crust; dip in the
asparagus liquor, butter, and lay in a hot dish. When you take up the
asparagus, drain, unbind the bundle, and heap it upon the toast, with
bits of butter between the stalks.


ASPARAGUS AND EGGS.

Cut twenty-five or thirty heads of asparagus into bits half an inch
long, and boil fifteen minutes. Have a cupful of rich drawn butter in a
saucepan, and put in the asparagus when you have drained it dry. Heat
together to a boil, seasoning with pepper and salt, and pour into a
buttered bake dish. Break five or six eggs carefully over the surface;
put a bit of butter upon each; sprinkle with salt, and pepper, and put
in the oven until the eggs are set.


Or, 

You may beat the eggs—yolks and whites separately—to a froth; season
with butter, pepper, and salt; stir them together, with the addition
of three tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, and pour evenly over the
asparagus mixture in the dish. This is decidedly the better way of the
two, although somewhat more troublesome.


ASPARAGUS IN AMBUSH. 

Cut off the tender tops of fifty heads of asparagus; boil and drain
them. Have ready half a dozen (or more) stale biscuit or rolls, from
which you have cut a neat top slice and scraped out the crumb. Set them
in the oven to crisp, laying the tops beside them that the cavities
may be well dried. Meanwhile, put into a saucepan a sugarless custard
made of a pint—if you need so much—of milk, and four well-whipped eggs.
Boil the milk first, before beating in the eggs; set over the fire and
stir until it thickens, when add a great spoonful of butter, a little
salt and pepper; lastly, the asparagus tops, minced fine. Do not let
it boil, but take from the fire so soon as the asparagus is fairly
in; fill the rolls with the mixture, put on the tops, fitting them
accurately; set in the oven three minutes, and arrange on a dish, to be
eaten hot.

The number of rolls will depend upon their size. It is better to have
them small, so that one can be served to each person. They will be
found extremely nice.


BOILED ONIONS.

Cut off tops and tails, and skin them. Lay in cold water half an hour,
then put into a saucepan with enough boiling water to cover them. Cook
fifteen minutes and drain off the water, re-covering them with more
from the boiling tea-kettle. Boil until a straw will pierce them; drain
and put into a dish with pepper, salt, and plenty of butter. Send
around drawn butter with them. Never cook onions in an iron pot.


STEWED ONIONS. 

Young onions should always be cooked in this way. Top, tail, and skin
them, lay them in cold water half an hour or more, then put into a
saucepan with hot water enough to cover them. When half done, throw off
all the water, except a small teacupful—less, if your mess be small;
add a like quantity of milk, a great spoonful of butter, with pepper
and salt to taste. Stew gently until tender, and turn into a deep dish.

If the onions are strong and large, boil in three waters, throwing away
all of the first and second, and reserving a very little of the third
to mix with the milk.

It ought to be more generally known that the disagreeable odor left by
any of the onion family upon the breath may be removed by chewing and
swallowing a few grains of roasted coffee. No more nutritious vegetable
ever finds its way to our tables, and it is greatly to be regretted
that the unpleasant result just named should deter so many from
eating it. It is especially beneficial to brain-workers and nervous
invalids—the very people who are least likely to taste it.


BAKED ONIONS.

The large Spanish or Bermuda onions are the only kinds which are
usually baked. Wash clean, but do not remove the skins. Boil an
hour—the water should be boiling when they are put in, and slightly
salt. Change it twice during this time, always replenishing with more,
boiling-hot. Turn off the water, take the onions out and lay upon a
cloth, that all the moisture may be absorbed or evaporate. Roll each
in a round piece of buttered tissue-paper, twisting it at the top to
keep it closed, and bake in a slow oven nearly an hour. When tender
all through, peel them, put them into a deep dish, and brown slightly,
basting with butter freely. This will take perhaps a quarter of an hour
more. Serve in a vegetable dish, and pour the melted butter over them
when you have sprinkled with pepper and salt.


STUFFED ONIONS.

Wash and skin very large Bermuda onions. Lay in cold water an hour.
Parboil in boiling water half an hour. Drain, and while hot extract
the hearts, taking care not to break the outer layers. Chop the inside
thus obtained very fine, with a little cold fat pork or bacon. Add
bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, mace, and wet with a spoonful or two of
cream. Bind with a well-beaten egg, and work into a smooth paste.
Stuff the onions with this; put into a dripping-pan with a very little
hot water, and simmer in the oven for an hour, basting often with
melted butter. When done, take the onions up carefully, and arrange
the open ends uppermost in a vegetable dish. Add to the gravy in the
dripping-pan the juice of half a lemon, four tablespoonfuls of cream or
milk, and a little browned flour wet with cold milk. Boil up once, and
pour over the onions.


STEWED TOMATOES. 

Loosen the skins by pouring scalding water upon them; peel and cut them
up, extracting the cores or hard parts of the stem end, and removing
all unripe portions. Stew in a saucepan (tin or porcelain) half an
hour, when add salt and pepper to taste, a teaspoonful of white sugar,
and a tablespoonful of butter. Stew gently fifteen minutes longer, and
serve.

Some cooks thicken the tomatoes with a little grated bread. A minced
onion—a small one—improves the flavor. Another pleasant variety is to
put a quarter as much green corn as you have tomatoes into the saucepan
when it is first set on the fire, and stew gently.


STUFFED BAKED TOMATOES. 

Choose large, smooth tomatoes, and cut a thin slice from the blossom
end of each, laying it aside for further use. Scoop out the inside, and
chop fine with a little grated bread, some green corn, salt, pepper,
a teaspoonful white sugar, and a tablespoonful butter. Mix well, and
stuff the hollowed tomatoes. Fit the tops on neatly, place in circular
rows in a deep dish and bake three-quarters of an hour, to a light
brown. Fill the interstices with the force-meat if you have any left,
before you bake. Do not peel them.


SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Peel and cut in slices a quarter of an inch thick. Pack in a
pudding-dish in alternate layers, with a force-meat made of
bread-crumbs, butter, salt, pepper, and a little white sugar. Spread
thickly upon each stratum of tomatoes, and when the dish is nearly
full, put tomatoes uppermost, a good bit of butter upon each slice.
