ennui. His grandmother had cherished the 
conviction that he was an undeveloped genius; but 
in regard to what particular field his genius was 
to enrich, she had never clearly expressed 
herself, and his own consciousness had not been 
more explicit. He had long ago made up his 
mind, indeed, that his grandmother's convictions 
had been the fond delusions of a doting parent, 
and that the sooner he unburdened himself of that 
particular legacy the better. The unburdening, 
however, had been accomplished .with a good 
deal of bitterness, for he was very ambitious and 
very proud, and to be obliged to digest the fact 
that he was but a type of the great majority was 
distinctly galling. True, politics were left. His 
father, one of the most distinguished of 
England's statesmen, and a member of the present 
cabinet, would have been delighted to assist his 
career; but Harold disliked politics. With the 
exception of his passing interest in the Russian 
socialists — an interest springing from his 
adventurous nature — he had never troubled himself 
about any party, faction, or policy, home or 
foreign. He would like to write a great poem, but 
he had never felt a second's inspiration, and had 
never wasted time in the endeavor to force it. 
Failing that, he would like to write a novel; 
but, fluently and even brilliantly as he 
sometimes talked, his pen was not ready, and he was 
conscious of a conspicuous lack of imagination. 
To be sure, one does not need much in these 
days of realistic fervor; it is considered 
rather a coarse and old-fashioned article; but 
that one needs some sort of a plot is indisputable, 
and Dartmouth's brain had consistently 
refused to evolve one. Doubtless he could 
cultivate the mere habit of writing, and achieve 
reputation as an essayist. His critical faculty 
was pronounced, and he had carefully developed 
it; and it was possible that when the world had 
completely palled upon him, he would shut 
himself up at Crumford Hall and give the public the 
benefit of his accumulated opinions, abstract 
and biographical. But he was not ready for 
that yet; he needed several years more of experience, 
observation, and assiduous cultivation of 
the habit of analysis; and in the meantime he 
was in a condition of cold disgust with himself 
and with Fate. It may also have been gathered 
that Mr. Dartmouth was a young man of decidedly 
reckless proclivities. It is quite true that 
he never troubled himself about any question of 
morals or social ethics; he simply calculated the 



 

mathematical amount of happiness possible to 
the individual. That was all there was in life. 
Had he lived a generation or two earlier, he 
would have pursued his way along the paths of 
the prohibited without introspective analysis; 
but being the intellectual young man of the 
latter decades of the '19th century, it amused 
him to season his defiance of certain conventional 
codes with the salt of philosophy. 

Miss Penrhyn reached the Legation a few 
moments after Dartmouth's arrival, and he 
watched her as she entered the ballroom. She 
wore a simple white gown, embroidered about 
the corsage with silver crescents; and her 
richly-tinted brown hair was coiled about her 
head and held in place by a crescent-shaped 
comb. She was a tall, slim, shapely girl, with an 
extreme grace of carriage and motion, and a 
neck and arms whose clear olive was brought out 
with admirable effect by the dead white of her 
gown. Her face, somewhat listless and preoccupied 
as she entered, quickly brightened into 
animation as a number of men at once sur- 
rounded her. Dartmouth continued to watch 
her for a few moments, and concluded that he 
would like to know her, even if she were a girl 
and an ingenue. She was fascinating, apart from 
her beauty ; she looked different from other 
women, and that was quite enough to command 
his interest. It would be too much trouble to 



 

struggle for an introduction at present, however, 
and he allowed himself to be taken possession of 
by his cousin, Margaret Talbot, who, with the 
easy skill of a spoiled beauty, dismissed several 
other cavaliers upon his approach. They wan- 
dered about for a time, and finally entered a tiny 
boudoir fitted up to represent a bird's nest in 
tufted blue satin, with an infinite number of tea- 
cups so arranged as to be cunningly suggestive 
of eggs whose parents had been addicted to Dec- 
orative Art. 

" What do you think of the new beauty ? " 
demanded Mrs. Talbot, as they established 
themselves upon an extremely uncomfortable little 
sofa upheld between the outstretched wings of 
the parent bird, which was much too large for the 
eggs. 

" She does very well," replied Harold, who 
was wise in his generation. 

Mrs. Talbot put her handkerchief suddenly to 
her face and burst into tears. Dartmouth turned 
pale. 

" What is it, Margaret ? " he said. " Do 
not cry here ; people will notice, and make 
remarks." 

She made no reply, and he got up and moved 
restlessly about the room ; then returning he 
stood looking moodily down upon her. 

Some years before, just about the time he was 
emerging from knickerbockers, he had been madly 



 

in love with this golden-haired, hazel-eyed cousin 
of his, and the lady, who had the advantage of 
him in years, being unresponsive, he had haunted 
a very large and very deep ornamental pond in 
his grandmother's park for several weeks with 
considerable persistency. Had the disease at- 
tacked him in summer it is quite probable that 
this story would never have been written, for his 
nature was essentially a high-strung and tragic 
one ; but fortunately he met his beautiful 
cousin in mid-winter, and 'tis a despairing lover 
indeed who breaks the ice. Near as their relationship 
was, he had not met her again until the 
present winter, and then he had found that years 
had lent her additional fascination. She was 
extremely unhappy in her domestic life, and 
naturally she gave him her confidence and awoke 
that sentiment which is so fatally akin to 
another and sometimes more disastrous one. 

Dartmouth loved her with that love which a 
man gives to so many women before the day 
comes wherein he recognizes the spurious metal 
from the real. It was not, as in its first stage, 
the mad, unreasoning fancy of an unfledged boy,
