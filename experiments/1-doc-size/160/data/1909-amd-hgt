better come out now and sit in the sun a bit to 
dry out the dampness.” 

They followed his advice. Then Helen 
brought out a paper bag of cookies that Mrs. 
Stirling had insisted upon her taking, and the 
girls hailed them with delight. 

“ Some one ought to tell a story.” 

“Lois, you relate a composition about a fern, 
where he or she lived year after year and then 
was transplanted. Do it in the first person. 
‘ I was a tiny baby fern covered with pinkish 
gray fur when I poked my head out of the 
ground ’ ” 

“ Oh, isn’t that funny ! I do believe I 




could,” and she went on with an eagerness that 
was almost inspiration. 

“ I guess you young people better be getting 
back in the surrey,” advised Martin. 

“ Indeed it is full time.” 

“ And we can’t hear the other stories,” 
lugubriously. 

“ You can take them for compositions next 
week.” 

It did seem as if the sun was in a great 
hurry to get to the other side of the world and 
wake up the Chinese, Sadie said. But it left 
such a magnificent trail behind in all gorgeous 
tints. When that began to fade there came 
curious long streaks in the lavender gray. 

“ It’s drawing wind. There’ll be a change 
in the weather. And I shouldn’t wonder if 
we had rain,” announced Martin. 

The children were taken to their several 
homes, full of delight and wishing it could be 
over again. 

“ Please tell Mr. Hildreth it was a perfect 
success and he made a number of people very 
happy,” Helen Grant said to Martin. “ I 
shall write him a note of thanks.” 




He had been sitting in his library all the 
afternoon, reading a little, thinking a good 
deal, and half envying Martin with the merry 
group and the chatter. Yes, years ago he 
should have begun to fill the place with chil- 
dren. They would be growing up now. One 
tall, fine girl the eldest, who would be a charm- 
ing companion. They would drive and ride 
about the country’s ways, they would sit here 
in the library and read to each other, talk over 
poets and plays, compare the book heroes they 
liked best. By her choice he would have an 
insight into a cultivated, well-trained, broad- 
minded girl’s heart. They would travel and 
he would find new delights, looking through 
the fresh, sweet eyes of youth. 

Oh, yes, he had missed a good deal by an 
unlucky turn of fate. It was too late to begin 
now. 

The ideally perfect autumn came to a sud- 
den end. Sunday was cloudy and cold, a gray 
day with a sort of sullen wind that seemed to 
be looking for all the weak places in the sum- 
mer’s worn armor. Helen went to church. 
How people grumbled, as if it was hardly a 



fair thing after the serene weather. The 

roasted chicken and the sweet potatoes went to 
Helen’s heart. Mrs. Stirling had a cheerful 
wood fire kindled in the sitting-room, and the 
pine cones and hemlock branches gave out a 
penetrating fragrance. 

She read a while afterward, then she wrote 
some letters. It seemed to bring the friends 
so near. Shirley was still enthusiastically 
happy, and Mrs. Bell’s content was so sweet a 
thing it brought tender tears to Helen’s eyes. 
And Juliet was so happy and busy. The girls 
wrote every week, but they thought the 
happiest time of all would be when they had 
graduated and come home for good. “ And 
I think of the pleasure we shall have. I hope 
their father, in some mysterious manner, can 
see their joy. It gladdens my life so much,” 
Juliet wrote, and Helen knew how sweet a 
smile irradiated her face. Baby was the 
sweetest and most affectionate little thing. “ I 
don’t see how she can be so sweet and good, a 
weed growing in the slums, but there might 
have been some virtues back of her. I thank 
God every day that he placed me where I 


 

could save her, and I pity the poor woman 
whose husband had not enough faith in God 
to allow her to rescue ‘ one of these little 
ones!  What if I had had a husband who 
objected ! ” 

Helen smiled a little over that. 

Then there was Mrs. Yarrow’s enthusiasm, 
and the professor’s joy. “ It is the loveliest 
and grandest thing of all my life. I thought I 
had made him happy before, but this exquisite 
satisfaction is quite indescribable. I think he 
looks on all girls with tenderer eyes, but I hope 
he will not be too indulgent. You can’t think 
how much we want you to come to see our 
happy household.” 

How alike the real and the assumed mother- 
hood was ! Only in Juliet’s life there was no 
third person to share the blessing. 

The storm came on fiercely now and the 
wind blew in long sweeps and with a roar, like 
. some unhappy monster striving to escape. 
Mrs. Stirling always took a nap on Sunday 
afternoon; she never called it a siesta. It 
grew darker. Helen put up her portfolio and 
drew a rocking-chair nearer the fire just for 




sociability. Lilian sat on the other side. It 
seemed as if she looked rather despondent. 

Helen wondered a little if she had been quite 
as friendly as was her duty. They had not 
assimilated in any great degree. Helen’s 
training had made her sufficient for herself and
