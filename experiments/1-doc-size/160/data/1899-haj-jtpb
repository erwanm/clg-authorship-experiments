"Yes."

"I didn't expect so much."

"I like to pay liberally, and expect to be well served."

"When shall I commence, sir?"

"At once. I want to take the next train for the city. As I go down
stairs I will tell them that you are to take your meals here. Now,
Chester, I will leave you with your new friend, as I have barely time to
reach the next train for New York."




CHAPTER XV.

TWO ODD ACQUAINTANCES.


"Ten dollars a week!" repeated Harry Bertram, to who Jed communicated
his good luck. "Why, that is famous!"

"Ten dollars a week and my meals!"

"Better still. That is better than acting."

"I don't know how I shall suit Mr. Holbrook."

"You will suit him if you suit the boy."

By this time Chester made his appearance.

"I want to walk on the beach," he said. "Come, Jed."

And the boy put his hand confidingly in that of Jed.

They descended the steps that led from the bluff to the beach, and
walked leisurely up and down on the sand. Presently Chester expressed a
wish to sit down, and before long was engaged with a small wooden spade
in making a sand fortification.

Relieved from duty, since his young charge could come to no harm, Jed
had leisure to watch the crowds passing him in both directions.

Presently a thin, dark-complexioned man, of perhaps thirty-five, after
walking up and down the beach, came to a stop, and, apparently without
motive, seated himself on the sand beside Chester and his youthful
guardian.

"A pleasant day," he remarked, looking at Jed.

"Yes," answered Jed politely.

He was not favorably impressed by the stranger's appearance, but
recognized the claims of courtesy.

"Is this little boy your brother?"

"No," answered Jed.

"I thought perhaps you brought him down to the beach."

"I did."

"I have seen him about before--with a girl."

"That was Clara, my old nurse," said Chester, who caught the drift of
the conversation. "I haven't got any nurse now," he added proudly. "I
saw you talking to Clara one day," he added, after a closer examination
of the stranger's features.

"Oh, no, my little boy!" said the man, seeming annoyed. "I don't know
Clara, as you call her."

"Then you look just like the man that was talking with her."

The stranger opened his mouth and smiled unpleasantly.

"I dare say there are people that look like me," he said, "though I
can't say I ever met one. What is your name, my little friend?"

"I am not your friend," said Chester, who did not appear favorably
impressed by his new acquaintance.

"My little enemy, then."

"My name is Chester Holbrook."

"And how old are you?"

"Ten years old. How old are you?"

Again the man's lips opened in an unpleasant smile.

"You have an inquiring mind, Chester," he said. "I am--thirty years
old."

"You look older than that."

"I am afraid that is not polite, Chester," said Jed gently.

"Why isn't it?" asked Chester innocently.

"People don't like to be thought older than they are."

"Oh, never mind," said the dark man. "A child is licensed to say what he
pleases. So he is your charge?"

"Yes, sir."

"I don't think I have seen you here before. Have you known Mr. Holbrook
long?"

"No." Then upon the impulse of the moment Jed inquired, "Do you know
him?"

The man's face changed, and he looked a shade embarrassed.

"Why do you think I know him?" he asked.

"I don't think it, but as you seemed interested in the boy, I asked you
the question."

"Oh, that's it. I have seen Mr. Holbrook, and I may have spoken to him.
I can't be sure on the subject, as I meet a good many people. Are you
going in bathing?"

"Do you want to bathe, Chester?" asked Jed.

"No; papa told me not to go to-day, as I have a cold."

"I thought perhaps I would have had your company in the surf. Well, I
must be going or I shall be late for the bath."

The stranger got up slowly and sauntered away.

"I don't like that man. Do you, Jed?" asked Chester.

"Not very much. I never saw him before."

"I have seen him. I saw him one day last week."

"Did you see him on the beach?"

"Yes; he came up and talked with Clara."

"But he said you were mistaken about that."

"I was not mistaken," said Chester positively. "I remember him very
well."

"Do you remember what he was talking about?" asked Jed, struck by what
the boy said.

"Yes; he was asking questions about me."

"He seems a good deal interested in you. Perhaps he is especially fond
of small boys."
