She was fresh and bright this morning as she greeted 
Kathie. Her clear eyes had a curiously limpid look, and 
a little something about her was changed. Kathie guessed, 
but held her peace. 

"We are to have a nice, long day to ourselves," the 
young hostess said, as she led her up-stairs. " I have an- 
nounced on the right hand and on the left that I am 
engaged." 

" How good you are to give up all other plans and 
friends for me ! " And Sarah turned toward her with an 
appreciative smile. 

" There isn't much virtue in it when you are really in- 
terested yourself," answered Kathie. 

" Sometimes it quite puzzles me" and a dreamy look 
filled Sarah's eyes "how it is that you can care, that 
others care." And a softened inflection marked the words. 
" If I could give you back a tithe of the pleasure you have 
given me." 

" You have given me back an interest. One does tire 
of pure pleasures sometimes. I did last winter. I was 
really glad to get away from the gayeties, the round that 
never leads anywhere. And yet I enjoyed it. I realty 
am afraid sometimes of growing quite frivolous ; but it 
hasn't taken awaj" my appetite for solid food. When it 
does I shall have to turn over a new leaf." 

She looked so bright and enchanting that she seemed to 
Sarah, as she had more than once before, a denizen of a 
different world. Something beside wealth and culture had 
given her this. What was it? The glad heartsomeness 
that she put into everything, the truth that seemed better 
for being uttered in such a winsome voice. 





"I should like to go to Washington just once," Sarah 
began slowly. " Not for balls or parties, but to see the 
capital of the nation, and the men who make and obey 
her laws, the foreign ministers who come to us from other 
great countries. Did you ever think that seems our widest 
and greatest life? Then comes the State centre, then the 
family, and it reaches out to every one ; we all have a part 
in it, and it belongs to us just as truly as our own lives. I 
don't understand how people can become indifferent ; and yet 
nations do, and let themselves drop into decay. Individ- 
uals do, as well. Little towns and hamlets seem to go to 
sleep, and the slumber is dangerous. It is the old story of 
the enchanted lands, and the lotus-eaters crying, ' Let 
us alone.' " 

"I think you could rouse some of them, the near-by 
ones," said Kathie. " You make me feel as if I had been 
lazy and careless " 

" No one will accuse you" ; and Sarah colored a little. 
" I think you have roused a great many, and what is bet- 
ter, you reach out your hand to lead them over rough 
places. So many of them are like me, wandering about 
unguided, and needing to be put in the right way. But oh, 
there are so many things to see and to hear that I must 
not keep the floor, and dream aloud ! " 

Kathie thought how Bruce would enjoy a stirring talk 
with Sarah. He seemed always to be the one she wanted 
to share such things with. 

" And now," the visitor said, quietly, " I want to see the 
pictures and go on the journey with you. We did not 
finish last time, you remember, and that is six months 
ago." 

" Then we shall have to go to the library." And Kathie 
led the way. 

Uncle Robert had arranged the photopraphs and engrav- 
ings in portfolios, and the girls could sit at their ease 
and turn them over as they stood on the low easel. The 





library had taken on a deeper tone. It seemed to Kathie 
that everything had changed with her growth and develop- 
ment. 

Their first journey with the pictures had been in Paris 
and Rome. They went through Kathie's Russian expe- 
rience now, until luncheon was announced. Afterward 
they took up Scotland ; and here Kathie was vivid and en- 
thusiastic. 

The day grew warmer and lovelier. 

" We ought to go out and enjoy it," Kathie said, pres- 
ently. " Let us save the others for the next visit, then 
you will be sure to come again." 

" I shall want to come again, often : it is like a bit of 
fairy-land here ; but I would like a walk down around the 
lake. Do you ever go out rowing now? " 

" Not so much," returned Kathie. " You see the boys 
are grown up and busy or away, and there seem new pleas- 
ures. It is archery and lawn-tennis now ; and I have a friend 
who is fond of painting, so we go out together sketch- 
ing and studying up nature. Now and then Uncle Robert 
takes a row for exercise. How bright and happy it was ! " 

They turned into a half-shady path. The sunshine glim- 
mered through the young leaves and sifted golden grains 
upon the ground until it seemed to quiver, a shining mass. 
The air was sweet with manifold blossoming, and the soft 
fragrance of a ripened spring, more delicate and fine- than 
that of summer before the stronger and richer scents are 
blended. 

Sarah put her arm around Kathie's slender figure and 
drew her nearer with a little pressure. She was hardly as 
tall, but her ample figure gave her a more matronly air. 

" I ought to tell you something," she began, presently. 
''Iwant to tell you first of all, for it has come partly 
through you ; that is, I should not have been fitted for it, 
and it would have passed me by. And it seems so strange 
to have a great and blessed thing come into your life, when 





you realize how easily you might have missed it, and gone 
hungering for something all your days, without ever being 
able to tell just what it was." 

There was the faint tremulousness of deep emotion in 
Sarah's voice. 

"You did not think but how could you? that " 
Then her tone swelled to a certain joy fulness. ' l Kathie, 
some one loves me, has chosen me, and will set me in a 
blessed place. It seems so strange, unreal." 

" Mr. Truesdell," said Kathie, softly. 

" Oh ! did it appear so back to that little visit when you 
saw him ? I never dreamed how could I ? that any 
one would ask me to share such a life. I don't think I 
ever looked on marriage as a thing for myself. I liked 
teaching, and it seemed quite reasonable to fancy that I 
should some time get into a larger sphere, go Westward, 
perhaps, and devote my whole life to the work. I used to
