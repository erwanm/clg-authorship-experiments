Jeff seemed to think a moment before he answered : 

" Just exactly the same ! " 

"A little older?" 

" Not as I can see." 

" Does she hate keeping a hotel as badly as she 
expected ? " 

" That's what she says," answered Jeff, with a twin- 
kle. All the time, while he was talking with West- 
over, he was breaking out to his horses, which he 

 

governed with his voice, trotting them up hill and 
down, and walking them on the short, infrequent lev- 
els, in the mountain fashion. 

Westover almost feared to ask, " And how is Jack- 
son?" 

"First rate. That is, for him. He's as well as ever 
he was, I guess, and he don't appear a day older. 
You've changed some," said Jeff, with a look round 
at Westover. 

" Yes ; I'm twenty-nine, now, and I wear a heavier 
beard." Westover noticed that Jeff was clean shaved 
of any sign of an approaching beard, and artistically 
he rejoiced in the fellow's young, manly beauty, which 
was very regular and sculpturesque. " You're about 
eighteen ? " 

" Nearer nineteen." 

" Is Jackson as much interested in the other world 
as he used to be ? " 

" Spirits ? " 

"Yes." 

" I guess he keeps it up with Mr. Whitwell. He 
don't say much about it at home. He keeps all the 
books, and helps mother run the house. She couldn't 
very well got along without him." 

" And where do you come in ? " 

" Well, I look after the transportation," said Jeff, 
with a nod toward his horses. " When I'm at home, 
that is. I've been at the Academy in Lovewell the 
last three winters, and that means a good piece of the 
summer too, first and last. But I guess I'll let mother 
talk to you about that." 



 

" All right," said Westover. " What I don't know 
about education isn't worth knowing." 

JeS laughed, and said to the ofi horse, which seemed 
to know that he was meant, " Get up, there ! " 

" And Cynthia ? Is Cynthia at home ? " Westover 
asked. 

" Yes. They're all down in the little wood-colored 
house, yet. Cynthia teaches winters, and summers she 
helps mother. She has charge of the dining-room." 

" Does Franky cry as much aa ever ? " 

" No. Frank's a fine boy. He's in the house too. 
Kind of bell-boy." 

"And you haven't worked Mr. Whitwell in, any- 
where ? " 

" Well, he talks to the ladies, and takes parties of 
'em mountain-climbing. I guess we couldn't get along 
without Mr. Whitwell. He talks religion to 'em." 
He cast a mocking glance at Westover over his shoul- 
der. " Women seem to like religion, whether they 
belong to church or not." 

Westover laughed, and asked, "And Fox? How's 
Fox ? " 

" Well," said Jeff, " we had to give Fox away. He 
was always cross with the boarders' children. My 
brother was on from Colorado, and he took Fox back 
with him." 

" I didn't suppose," said Westover, " that I should 
have been sorry to miss Fox. But I guess I shall be." 

Jeff seemed to enjoy the implication of his words. 
"He wasn't a bad dog. He was stupid." 

When they arrived at the foot of the lane, mounting 



 

to the farm, Westover saw what changes had been 
made in the house. There were large additions, taste- 
less and characterless, but giving the rooms that were 
needed. There was a vulgar modernity in the new 
parts, expressed with a final intensity in the four-light 
windows, which are esteemed the last word of domes- 
tic architecture in the country. JefE said nothing as 
they approached the house, but Westover said, " Well, 
you've certainly prospered. You're quite magnificent." 

They reached the old level in front of the house, 
artificially widened out of his remembrance, with a 
white flag-pole planted at its edge, and he looked up 
at the front of the house, which was unchanged, ex- 
cept that it had been built a story higher back of the 
old front, and discovered the window of his old room. 
He could hardly wait to get his greetings over with 
Mrs. Durgin and Jackson, who both showed a decorous 
pleasure and surprise at his coming, before he asked, 
" And could you let me have my own room, Mrs. Dur- 
gin?" 

" Why, yes," she said. " If you don't want some- 
thing a little nicer." 

" I don't believe you've got anything nicer," West- 
over said. 

" All right, if you think so," she retorted. " You 
can have the old room, anyway." 



X. 

Westover could not have said he felt very much 
at home on his first sojourn at the farm, or that ho 
had cared greatly for the Durgins. But now he felt 
very much at home, and as if he were in the hands of 
friends. 

It was toward the close of the afternoon that he 
arrived, and he went in promptly to the meal that was 
served shortly after. He found that the farm-house 
had not evolved so far in the direction of a hotel as 
to have reached the stage of a late dinner. It was tea 
that he sat down to, but when he asked if there were 
not something hot, after listening to a catalogue of the
