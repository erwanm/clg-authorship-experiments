" What will become of you ? what will become 
of you?" he went on as if he had not heard 
her. 

"You pity me too much," she answered after 
an instant. " I've failed, but I did what I could. 
It was all that I saw it was all that was left 



 

me. It took hold of me, it possessed me : it was 
the last gleam of a chance." 

Paul flushed like a sick man under a new 
wave of despair. " A chance for what ? " 

"To make him hate her. You'll say my cal 
culation was grotesque my stupidity as ignoble 
as my crime. All I can answer is that I might, 
none the less, have succeeded. People have 
in worse conditions. But I don't defend myself 
I'm face to face with my mistake. I'm face 
to face with it for ever and that's how I wish 
you to see me. Look at me well ! " 

" I would have done anything for you ! " He 
broke out as if all talk with her were vain. 

She considered this ; her dreadful face was 
lighted by the response it kindled. "Would 
you do anything now?" Paul answered noth 
ing ; he seemed lost in the vision of what was 
carrying her through. " I saw it as I saw it," 
she continued : " there it was and there it is. 
There it is there it is," she repeated in a tone 
sharp, for a flash, with all the excitement she 
contrived to keep under. "It has nothing to do 
now with any part of me any other possibility 
even of what may be worst in me. It's a storm 
that's past, it's a debt that's paid. I may liter- 





ally be better." At the expression this brought 
into his face she interrupted herself. " You 
don't understand a word I say ! " 

He was following her as she showed she 
could see only in the light of his own emo 
tion ; not in that of any feeling that she herself 
could present. " Why didn't you speak to me 
why didn't you tell me what you were think 
ing? There was nothing you couldn't have told 
me, nothing that wouldn't have brought me 
nearer. If I had known your abasement " 

" What would you have done ? " Rose de 
manded. 

" I would have saved you." 

" What would you have done ? " she pressed. 

" Everything." 

She was silent while he went to the window. 
" Yes, I've lost you I've lost you," she said at 
last. " And you were the thing I might have had. 
He told me that, and I knew it." 

" ' He ' told you ? " Paul had faced round. 

" He tried to put me off on you. That was 
what finished me. Of course they'll marry," she 
abruptly continued. 

"Oh, yes, they'll marry." 

" But not soon, do you suppose ? " 



 

"Not soon. But sooner than they think." 

Rose looked surprised. " Do you already know 
what they think?" 

" Yes that it will never be." 

" Never ? " 

" Coming about so horribly. But some day 
it will be." 

" It will be," said Rose. " And I shall have 
done it for him. That's more," she said, " than 
even you would have done for we." 

Strange tears had found their way between 
Paul's close lids. " You're too horrible," he 
breathed ; " you're too horrible." 

" Oh, I talk only to you : it's all for you. Re 
member, please, that I shall never speak again. 
You see," she went on, " that he daren't come." 

Paul looked afresh at his watch. " I'll go with 
you." 

Rose hesitated. "How far?" 

" I'll go with you," he simply repeated. 

She looked at him hard ; in her eyes too there 
were tears. " My safety my safety ! " she mur 
mured. 

Paul went round for his hat, which, on his 
entrance, he had put down. " I'll go with you," 
he said once more. 







Still, however, she hesitated. " Won't he need 
you?" 

"Tony? for what?" 

" For help." 

It took Paul a moment to understand. "He 
wants none." 

" You mean he has nothing to fear ? " 

" From any suspicion ? Nothing." 

"That's his advantage," said Rose. "People 
like him too much." 

"People like him too much," Paul replied. 
Then he exclaimed: "Mr. Vidal!" to which, 
as she looked, Rose responded with a low, deep 
moan. 

Dennis had appeared at the window ; he gave 
signal in a short, sharp gesture and remained 
standing in the dusk of the terrace. Paul put 
down his hat ; he turned away to leave his com 
panion free. She approached him while Dennis
