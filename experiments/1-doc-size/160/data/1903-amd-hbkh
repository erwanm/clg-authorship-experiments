her mother. ‘‘And as a reward yon 
shall have a nice, pleasant week at 
Grandma’s. Annt Lucy will be glad to 
have you.” 

There was a great lump in Bessie’s 
throat, but she had not the courage to 
speak, and afternoon came so soon. Her 
mother laid out her pretty lawn dress, 
and her father took her to the station and 
gave her into the conductor’s charge. 
But Bessie’s heart was not as light as it 
should have been for a little girl who was 
going to make a pleasant visit. 

Bessie had a delightful visit with her 
Aunt Lucy. Grandmother was just be- 
ginning to sit up a little, and she was a 
very pleasant old lady to wait upon. She 

read aloud from an entertaining book, 
sewed a little, and had one tea-party with 
some neighboring girls. 

‘'How much you have improved!’' her 
Aunt Lucy would say. "How thought- 
ful you are! What a help your mother 
must find you ! " 

Bessie would flush at this praise and 
feel that she did not deserve it. If she 
only could make Aunt Lucy stop ! 

I said in the beginning that Bessie was 
not a persistently deceitful girl. She 
sometimes did naughty things and let 
them '‘blow over,’’ as people say; but 
they always troubled her, and made her 
much more conscientious while they were 
in her mind. And the pretty lawn dress 
that she put on every afternoon kept it 
all fresh. She was very glad she had 
succeeded in repairing it, and there was 

 


no real harm done anywhere, only she 
had not been trusty nor truthful, nor kind 
to Freddy. It wasn 't at all likely any of 
it would come to light, but she wished it 
never had happened. 

The next Saturday Dick came over, 
and on Monday morning he took her 
home. School was to begin, so she could 
only kiss her mother and the children and 
run away ; but her mother had looked up 
her books and her lunch-box. 

That afternoon she said to Bessie — 
'‘Did you see anything of a handsome 
piece of thread lace, Bessie, that I have 
been wearing in my silk dress? I did it 
up the very day I went to Grandmother 's, 
and laid it in the top of my drawer. I 
was in a hurry, and so did not stop to put 
it in my lace-box. ’ ’ 

said Bessie, slowly. 

 


You did not go to the drawer for anything ! ’

‘‘I am sure I did not!" 

'‘Well, it is strange. I would not care 
so much, hut it was expensive, and that 
for my sleeves matched. Still, I may 
have mislaid it.'’ 

Bessie felt warm and confused. She 
remembered now that Carrie Lanham 
had been accused at school of being 
light-fingered." She had lingered in 
the rooms after Bessie came down, and 
said she had been looking out of every 
window. Of course she had broken 
Dick’s beautiful cologne bottle, but she 
surely could not have had the face to 
steal— that was just it. Oh, if she only 
had not asked her to come ! Her mother 
had often said, would so much rather 
have you ask girls in when I am home 

 


than when I am out, Bessie’’; but the 
little girl had been so intent upon suiting 
herself those few days. 

She asked Carrie Lanliam at recess 
next morning, in* a rather confused and 
delicate maner to be sure, but Carrie was 
very indignant, and denied ‘'up and 
down, ’ ’ as the children say. 

"But you did break Dick’s cologne bot- 
tle,” Bessie exclaimed, decisively. '‘No 
one else was in the room ; and you came 
down drenched with cologne. ’ ’ 

‘'It’s no such thing! You are the 
meanest girl I ever heard of, Bessie Col- 
lins! I would not be hired to step in 
your house again, and I won’t speak to- 
you this whole term ; you see if I do. ’ ’ 
Bessie went to her seat and dropped a 
few quiet tears over her book. Her 
mother knew best, of course. She 

 


thought her so strict, so almost queer at 

times, and yet it was wisest, no doubt. 

Her judgment had not brought about 

very good results, she had to confess. If 

she only could have found her mother’s 

beautiful lace ; but it never came to light. 

" Have you read the book I gave you ! ’ ’ 
Dick asked one evening when they were 
in the kitchen making candy. "But of 
course you have, and it’s just splendid, 
isn’t it?” 

Bessie’s eyes dropped and her brow 
flushed, for her cheeks were red as roses 
before. 

I— no, I haven’t,” she answered, 
with much confusion. 

"Why?” and Dick’s bright face was 
full of disappointment. ‘‘Didn’t you 
like to have it, or had you read it 
before?”
