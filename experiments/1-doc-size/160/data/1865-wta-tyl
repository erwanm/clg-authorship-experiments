 

those leer-eyed, grinning debauchees, who seemed to be 
opening the gate of hell, and bidding him enter. 

" Tom Somers," said the still small voice which had 
spoken to him a thousand times before in the perils and 
temptations through which he had passed, " you have 
behaved yourself very well thus far. You have been 
promoted for bravery on the battle-field ; and now will 
you cower in the presence of this brilliant brawler, and 
these weak-minded, cowardly tipplers? What would 
your mother say if she could see you now, with your 
shaking hand fastened to the wine-cup? What would 
Lilian Ashford say ? Dare you drink the health of Em- 
mie Guilford in such a place as this? You should have 
smote the lips that mentioned her name in such a pres- 
ence ! ' 

He drew back his hand from the glass. His muscles 



tightened up, as they had on the bloody field of Williams- 
burg. Tom Somers was himself again. 



" Come, Somers, you don't drink," added the captain 
sarcastically. 

" No, I thank you ; I never drink," he answered resO' 
lutely, as he cast a steady glance of pity and contempt at 
the bloated crew who had been revelling in his embarrass- 
ment. 

" You won't refuse now?" 

" Most decidedly." 

'' Lieutenant Somers, I took you for a young man of 



 

pluck. I'm disappointed. You will pardon me, my 
dear fellow ; but I can't help regarding your conduct as 
rather shabby." 

" I never drink, as I have said before ; and I do not 
intend to begin now. If I have been shabby, I hope you 
will excuse me." 

" Certainly I will excuse you, when you atone for 
your folly, and drink with me." 

The spectators laughed, and evidently thought the captain
had made a point. 

" Then I can never atone for my folly, as you call 
it," replied Somers, his courage increasing as the trial 
demanded it. 

""What would Lord Raglan have said if I had refused 

to drink his Sicily Madeira?" 

" Very likely he would have said just what you said ; 
but there would have been no more sense in it then than 
now.' 




Bully for young 'un ! "' said a seedy dandy, whose 
love of fancy drinks had made a compromise with his 
love of dress. 

" I will leave it to these gentlemen to decide whether 
I have not spoken reason and good sense." 

" I will leave you and these gentlemen to settle that 
question to suit yourselves, and I will bid you good 
evening/' said Somers, rising from his chair. 

The unpleasant emphasis which he placed upon the 



 

word " gentlemen " created a decided sensation among 
the group of idlers ; and, as he stepped from behind the 
table, he was confronted by a young man with blood- 
shot eyes and bloated cheeks, but dressed in the ex- 
treme of fashion. 

" Sir, you wear the colors of the United-States army," 
said the juvenile tippler ; " but you can't be permitted to 
insult a gentleman with impunity." 

Lieutenant Somers wanted to laugh in the face of 
this specimen of bar-room chivalry, for he forcibly re- 
minded him of a belligerent little bantam-rooster that 
paraded the barnyard of his mother's cottage at Pinch- 
brook ; but he was prudent enough not to give any further 
cause of offence. Bestowing one glance at this champion 
of the tippler's coterie, he turned aside, and attempted to 
move towards the door. 

" Stop, sir," continued the young man, who plainly 
wanted to make a little capital out of a fight, in defence 
of the dignity of his friends. " You can't go without an 
apology, or or a fight," added the bully, shaking his 
head significantly, as he placed himself in front of the 
young lieutenant. 

"What am I to apologize for?" asked Somers. 

" You insulted the whole party of us. You intimated 
that we were no gentlemen." 

" I haven't spoken to any of you since I came in.'' 
protested Somers. " I never had any thing to do with 



 

you, and I don't know whether you are gentlemen or 
not." 

" You hear that, gentlemen ! "' added the bully. 

" I think I have said all that is necessary to say, and 
with your leave I will go," said Somers. 

" Stop, sir ! " snarled the young ruffian, putting his hand 
on the lieutenant's collar. 

" Take your hand off! " said he sternly. 

The fellow complied. 

"This thing has gone far enough, sir," said Captain 
de Banyan, stepping between Somers and his assailant. 
" Lieutenant Somers is my friend ; and, if you put the 
weight of your little finger upon him, I'll annihilate you 
quicker than I did a certain Austrian field-marshal at 
the battle of Solferino. Gentlemen, permit me to apolo- 
gize for my inexperienced friend if he has uttered any 
indiscreet word." 

"He must apologize!" blustered the young ruffian. 
"He says AVC are no gentlemen. Let him prove it." 

" You have proved it yourself, you little ape," replied 
the captain, as he stepped up to the bar, and paid liis 
reckoning, bestowing no more attention upon .the ruffled
