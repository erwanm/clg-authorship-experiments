the burial of the prophet, that he almost thought she 
had wished to take advantage of a trifle for the sake 
of annoying him. He felt that doubt which never 
comes so suddenly and wounds so keenly as when 
a man feels the most certain of his position and of 
himself. 

He retired to his apartment in the palace with a 
burden of unhappiness and evil presentiment that 
was new to him. It was very different from the 
sincere sorrow he had felt and still suffered for the 
death of his master and friend. That misfortune had 
not affected him as regarded Nehushta. But now he 
had been separated from her during all the week by 
the exigencies of the funeral ceremonies, and he had 
looked forward to meeting her this evening as to a 



 

great joy after so much mourning, and he was disap- 
pointed. She had affected to be offended with him, 
yet his reason told him that he had acted naturally 
and rightly. Could he, the bearer of the prophet's 
body, the captain of all the fortress, the man of all 
others upon whom all eyes were turned, have exchanged love glances or spoken soft words to the 
princess by his side at such a time ? It was absurd ; 
she had no right to expect such a thing. 

However, he reflected that a new kind of life was 
to begin on the morrow. For the best part of a 
month he would ride by her litter all day long, and 
sit at her table at noonday and evening ; he would 
watch over her and take care of her, and see that her 
slightest wants were instantly supplied ; a thousand 
incidents would occur whereby he might re-establish 
all the loving intimacy which seemed to have been so 
unexpectedly shaken. And so, consoling himself 
with the hopes of the future, and striving to overlook 
the present, he fell asleep, wearied with the fatigues 
and sorrows of the day. 

But Nehushta lay all night upon her silken cushions, and watched the flickering little lamp and the 
strange shadows it cast among the rich, painted carvings of the ceiling. She slept little, but waking she 
dreamed of the gold and the glitter of Shushan, of the 
magnificence of the young king, and of the brilliant 
hard-featured beauty of Atossa, whom she already 
hated or had determined to hate. The king inter- 
ested her most. She tried to recall his features and 
manner as he had appeared when he tarried one night 
in the fortress a year previous. She remembered a 



 

black-browed man in the prime of youth, with heavy 
brows and an eagle nose ; his young beard growing 
black and square about his strong dark features, 
which would have seemed coarse saving for his bright 
eyes that looked every man fearlessly in the face. 
A short man he seemed in her memory, square built 
and powerful as a bloodhound, of quick and decisive 
speech, expecting to be understood before he had 
half spoken his thoughts; a man, she fancied, who 
must be untiring and violent of temper, inflexible 
and brave in the execution of his purpose — a strong 
contrast outwardly to her tall and graceful lover. 
Zoroaster's faultless beauty was a constant delight 
to her eyes ; his soft deep voice sounded voluptuously 
passionate when he spoke to herself, coldly and 
deliberately dominating when addressing others. He 
moved with perfect certainty and assurance of purpose, his whole presence breathed a high and superior 
wisdom and untainted nobility of mind; he looked 
and acted like a god, like a being from another world, 
not subject to mortal passions, nor to the temptations 
of common mankind. She gloried in his perfection 
and in the secret knowledge that to her alone he 
was a man simply and utterly dominated by love. 
As she thought of him she grew proud and happy in 
the idea that such a man should be her lover, and she 
reproached herself for doubting his devotion that 
evening. After all, she had only complained that he 
had neglected her — as he had really done, she added. 
She wondered in her heart whether other men would 
have done the same in his place, or whether this 
power of coldly disregarding her presence when he 



 

was occupied with a serious matter were not due to 
a real and unconquerable hardness in his nature. 

But as she lay there, her dark hair streaming over 
the yellow silk of her pillows, her mind strayed from 
her lover to the life before her, and the picture rose 
quickly in her imagination. She even took up the 
silver mirror that lay beside her and looked at herself 
by the dim light of the little lamp, and said to herself that she was beautiful, and that many in Shushan 
would do her homage. She was glad that Atossa 
was so fair — it would be a better contrast for her 
own dark southern beauty. 

Towards morning she slept, and dreamed of the 
grand figure of the prophet, as she had seen him 
stretched upon his death-bed in the upper chamber 
of the tower ; she thought the dead man stirred and 
opened his glazed eyes and pointed at her with his 
bony fingers, and spoke words of anger and reproach. 
Then she woke with a short cry in her terror, and the 
light of the dawn shone gray and clear through the 
doorway of the corridor at the end of her room, 
where two of her handmaids slept across the threshold, their white cloaks drawn over their heads 
against the chill air of the night. 

Then the trumpets rang out in long-drawn clang- 
ing rhythm through the morning air, and Nehushta 
heard the trampling of the beasts that were being got 
ready for the journey, in the court without, and the 
cries of the drivers and of the serving-men. She rose 
quickly from her bed — a lithe white-clad figure in 
the dawn light — and pushed the heavy curtains 
aside and looked out through the lattice; and she 



 

forgot her evil dream, for her heart leaped again at 
the thought that she should no more be shut up in 
Ecbatana, and that before another month was over 
she would be in Shushan, in the palace, where she 
longed to be. 



 



CHAPTER V. 

The sun was almost setting, and his light was 
already turning to a golden glow upon the vast plain 
of Shushan, as the caravan of travellers halted for 
the last time. A few stades away the two mounds 
rose above the royal city like two tables out of the 
flat country ; the lower one surmounted by the mar- 
ble columns, the towers and turrets and gleaming 
architraves of the palace ; and in front, upon the 
right, the higher elevation crowned by the dark and 
massive citadel of frowning walls and battlements. 
The place chosen for the halt was the point Avhere 
the road from Nineveh, into which they had turned 
when about half-way from Ecbatana, joined the broad 
road from Babylon, near to the bridge. For some 
time they had followed the quiet stream of the
