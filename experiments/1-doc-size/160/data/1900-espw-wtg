that when your evil had you. (I couldn’t get there when you were good,
you know.) I tried to take the reins. I tried to get the whip--I could
not do it. I meant to hit the horse--my arm was held. (There are
always so many of these holy busybodies about--angels and messengers of
sanctity--to interfere with one!) Oh, then I sprang out--over the wheel
into the street. You didn’t see me, but Donna did. When she shied I
clung to her bit. And then she bolted.... It was a very simple thing.

(DR. THORNE recoiling slowly, an expression of cold horror chills his
features.)

CLEO (still raving). Yes, I’ve murdered you--if you will--and Mary
Fayth besides. And I’ve broken Helen’s heart. Do you suppose that
counts? Who counts? Nobody on earth, or in heaven, or in hell. I’ve got
you away from your wife.... And in earth, or in heaven, or in hell,
I’ll have you yet....

DR. THORNE (throwing out his hands; holds her off with evidences of
unbearable repulsion; speaks with difficulty). And I pitied you a
moment since. Now I cannot scorn you. It is too fine a word.

CLEO (more calmly). I can abide my time.

       Enter LADDIE, running rapidly.

LADDIE. Papa, Papa! Oh, I missed you, Papa!

CLEO (starting). I did not know the child was dead! (Looks
disconcerted.)

DR. THORNE (catches the child, and holds him to his heart; speaks).
No. You only knew you left him fatherless. (With much agitation,
continues.) How did you get here, Laddie? How did you find the way?
Papa hadn’t forgotten his little boy. I was coming right back to you, my
son.

LADDIE (mysteriously; looking about). A man with wings brought me. We
flowed over.... He is waiting out there to take us back. (Observing
CLEO, LADDIE slips down to the ground, and backs up against his
father’s knees; points at the woman.) Papa, I don’t like that lady.

DR. THORNE (cruelly). My son, I cannot deny that I respect your taste.
(Clasps the boy to his heart again; then puts him down once more, and,
with a fine motion, holds the child at arm’s-length between himself and
the woman.)

CLEO (averting her face). I perceive the importance of the obstacle. I
admit ... that to love a man who is the father of another woman’s
child--

DR. THORNE (interrupting). And who loves the mother of his child--

(CLEO sobs.)

DR. THORNE. Come, Laddie. (He does not glance at the woman again.)

       [Exeunt DR. THORNE and LADDIE.

CLEO (yearning after him; stretches out her arms, but does not follow;
calls mournfully). Oh, if you would come back a minute--only a
minute!... In heaven, or earth, or hell, I’d never ask anything of you
again. A minute, a minute!

(DR. THORNE does not return, and does not reply. CLEO is left alone
in the dead world. She falls flat upon the slag and ashes.)


       END OF SCENE II.


SCENE III.

Picturesquely visible among the trees of a grove
appears a small, rustic cottage, curiously interwoven
of bark, vines, boughs, leaves, and flowers--a building
which seems to have grown from the conditions
and the colors of the grove. The sea and the sails
show beyond, through the trees. In the distant perspective
can be seen the city on the hill; in the intervale,
the foliage, flowers, fields, as before.

The hour approaches sunset. A deep rich glow
mellows and melts the outlines of every object.

(Spirits pass and repass in the distance.)

Enter DR. THORNE and HARVEY, conversing
in low tones.

       Enter NORAH and JERRY.

JERRY. The brim of the avenin’ to yez, Doctor! Och! but this is a foine
counthree now.

NORAH (happily). Me father is getting acquainted here.

JERRY. I’m about to discover where the ... angels ... I’m at.

DR. THORNE (smiling). You’ve got ahead of me then, Jerry.

       [Exeunt NORAH and JERRY.

DR. THORNE (to HARVEY). And why, for instance, was I directed or
allowed to take that astronomical tour before I had investigated my
immediate surroundings?

HARVEY. A patient may ask questions. In your experience, did you
always answer them?

Enter LADDIE (running after his father,
whose hand he hurries to catch and
clasp).

DR. THORNE (pointing to the architecture beyond). And those public
buildings yonder--what do you call them?

HARVEY. Those are our institutions of education and of mercy. They are a
great pleasure to us. We have our temples, colleges, music halls,
libraries, schools of science, hospitals, galleries of art, as a matter
of course. What did you suppose we did with our intellects and our
leisure?

DR. THORNE. I never supposed anything on the subject. I never thought
about it.

HARVEY. Precisely. You are very ignorant--for a man of your gifts. Now,
our hospitals--

DR. THORNE. Pray do not mock me, Doctor Harvey. If you had a hospital,
you could find me something to do. The humiliating idleness of this
place crushes me. I seem to be of no more use here than a paralytic
patient was in my own charity ward at home. I am become of no more
social importance than the janitor or the steward used to be. I am of no
consequence. I am not in demand. No person desires my services. The
canker of idleness eats upon me. Here, in this world of spirits, I am an
unscientific, useless fellow. If you have anything whatever in the shape
of a hospital, I beg you to find me employment in it. At least, I could
keep the temperature charts, if I am not to be trusted with any cases.

HARVEY (smiling sadly). Your cure proceeds but slowly, my patient. I
did not think you were a dull man. Must you be taught the elements?
Our sick are not of the body, but are sick of soul. Our patients are
chiefly from among the newly arrived who are at odds with the spirit of
the place; hence, they suffer discomfort. Can you administer holiness
to a will and heart diseased?

(DR. THORNE shakes his head; bows it in bitter silence. He stands lost
in thought. As he does so, sunset deepens to twilight on the land.
LADDIE drops his father’s hand; plays among the annunciation lilies.
HARVEY, with a courtly salute, retires. He does not speak further to
DR. THORNE.)

       [Exit HARVEY.

LADDIE (breaks one of the tall lily-stalks--gently, for a boy. As he
does so, the cup opens, and a little white bird flies out, hangs poised
in the air a moment). Oh, the beautiful! (Catches the bird, which he
handles tenderly.) Papa! Papa! I went to pick a lily, and I picked a
bird! Oh, Papa, what a pretty country!
