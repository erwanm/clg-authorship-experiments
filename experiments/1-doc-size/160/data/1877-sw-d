' The woods are full of them.' 

' Don't you think it is a pity to catch them ? ' 

' For you ? ' said Basil. He was removing her empty 
plate, and putting before her another with an orange upon 
it, so accurately prepared that it stirred her admiration. 

' Oranges ! ' cried Diana. ' How did you learn to do 
everything, Basil ? ' 

' Don't be too curious,' said he. As he spoke, he softly 
put back of her ear a stray lock of the beautiful brown 
hair, which fell behind her like a cloud of wavy brightness. 
Even from that touch she inwardly shrank ; outwardly she 
was impassive enough. 

'Basil, 'said Diana suddenly, ' didn't I talk foolishly 
sometimes ? when I was sick I mean.' 

' Don't you ever do it when you are well ? ' 

'Do I?' 

' What do you think ? ' said he laughing, albeit his 
heart was not merry at the moment, but Diana's question 
was naive. 

' i did not think I was in the habit of talking foolishly.' 

' Your thoughts are true and just, as usual. It is so 
far from being in your habit, that it is hardly in your 
power,' he said tenderly. ' 



 

Diana eat her orange, for she was very fond of the 
fruit, and it gave occupation to hands and eyes while Basil 
was standing by. She did not like his evasion of her 
question, and pondered how she could bring it up again, 
between wish and fear. Before she was ready to speak 
the chance was gone. As Basil took away her plate he 
remarked that he had to go down to see old Mrs. Barstow ; 
and arranging her pillows anew, he stooped down and 
kissed her. 

Left alone, Diana sat still propped up in bed and 
stared into the fire, which grew brighter as the light without waned. How she rebelled against that kiss. ' No, he 
has no right to me ! ' she cried in her passionate thoughts ; 
' he has no right to me ! I am Evan's ; every bit of me is 
Evan's, and nobody's else. O how eame I to marry this 
man ! and what shall I do ? I wonder if I shall go mad ? 
for I am riot going to die. But how is it possible that I 
can live so ? ' 

She was slow in regaining strength. Yet little by little 
it came back, like a monarch entering a country that has 
rebelled against him. By and by she was able to sit up. 
Her husband had a luxurious easy chair sent from Boston 
for her and placed in her room ; and one evening, it was 
in February now, Diana got up and put herself in it. She 
had never known such a luxurious piece of furniture in her 
life ; she was dressed in a warm wrapper also provided by 
her husband and which seemed to her of extravagant 
daintiness ; and she sank into the depths of the one and 
the folds of the other with a helpless feeling of Basil's 
power over her, symbolized and emphasized by these 
things. Presently came Basil himself, again bringing her 
supper. He placed a small table by her side and set the 
tray there ; put the teapot down by the fire  and taking a 



 

view of his wife, gave a slight smile at the picture. He 
might well, having so good a conscience as this man had. 
Diana was one of those magnificent women who look well 
always and anywhere ; with a kitchen apron on and hands 
in flour, or in the disabille of careless undress ; but as her 
husband saw her then she was lovely in an exquisite degree. 
She was wrapped in a quilted dressing gown of soft grey 
stuff, with a warm shawl about her shoulders ; her beautiful abundant hair, which she had been too weak of hand 
and of heart too to dress elaborately, lay piled about her 
head in loose bright wavy masses, much more picturesque 
than Diana would have known how to make them by 
design. I think there is apt too to be about such women a 
natural grace of motion or of repose ; it was her case. To 
think of herself or the appearance she might at any time 
be making, was foreign to Diana ; the noble grace of unconsciousness, united to her perfectness of build, made 
her always faultless in action or attitude. If she moved or 
if she sat, it might have been a duchess, for the beautiful 
unconscious ease with which she did it. Nature's high 
breeding; there is such a thing; and there is such an 
effect of it, when the constitution of mind and body are 
alike noble. 

Basil poured out her cup of tea, and divided her quail 
and then sat down. It was hard for her to bear. 

' You are too good to me,' said Diana humbly. 

' I should like to see you prove that.' 

' I am not sure but you are too good to everybody.' 

' Why ? how can one be too good ? ' 

' You won't get paid for it.' 

' I think I shall,' said Basil ; in a quiet confident way 
he had, which was provoking if you were arguing with him. 
But Diana was not arguing with him. 



 

' Basil, I can never pay you,' she said with a voice that 
faltered a little. 

' You are sure of that in your own mind ? ' 

' Very sure ! ' 

' I am a man of a hopeful turn of nature. Shall I 
divide that joint for you ? ' 

' My hands cannot manage a quail ! ' said Diana yielding 
her knife and fork to him. 'What can make me so weak?' 

' You have had fever.' 

' But I have no fever now, and I do not seem to get 
my strength back.' 

' After the unnatural tension, Nature takes her re- 
venge.' 

' It is very hard on you ! ' 

' What ? ' 

Diana did not answer. She had spoken that last word 
with almost a break in her voice ; she gave her attention 
now diligently to picking the quail bones. But when her 
supper was done, and the tray delivered over to Miss Collins, Basil did not as sometimes he did, go away and leave 
her ; but sat down again and trimmed the fire. Diana lay 
back in her chai^looking at him. 

' Basil,' she said at last after a long silence, ' do you 
think mistakes, I mean, life-mistakes, can ever be mended 
in this world ? ' 

' You must define what you mean by mistakes,' he said 
without looking at her. ' There are no mistakes, love, but 
those which we make by our own fault.'
