hole in the top of the Rotonda" that is our Roman 
name for the Pantheon " that it would be very 
dark." 

"Precisely," said she. "I will go there at night, 
and see the moon shining through the hole in the 
dome." 

"Eh," cried Nino, laughing, "you will see the 
moon better outside in the piazza. Why should you 
go inside, where you can see so little of it?" 

" I will go, " replied the contessina. " The Italians 
have no sense of the beautiful the mysterious." 
Her eyes grew dreamy as she tried to call up the 
picture she had never seen. 

" Perhaps, " said Nino, humbly. " But, " he added, 
suddenly brightening at the thought, "it is very 
easy, if you would like to go. I will arrange it. 
Will you allow me ? " 

"Yes, arrange it. Let us go on with our lesson." 

I would like to tell you all about it; how Nino 
saw the sacristan of the Pantheon that evening, and 
ascertained from his little almanach which has all 



 

kinds of wonderful astrological predictions, as well 
as the calendar when it would be full moon. And 
perhaps what Nino said to the sacristan, and what 
the sacristan said to Nino, might be amusing. I am 
very fond of these little things, and fond of talking 
too. For since it is talking that distinguishes us 
from other animals, I do not see why I should not 
make the most of it. But you who are listening to 
me have seen very little of the Contessina Hedwig 
as yet, and unless I quickly tell you more you will 
wonder how all the curious things that happened to 
her could possibly have grown out of the attempt of 
a little singer like Nino to make her acquaintance. 
Well, Nino is a great singer now, of course, but he 
was little once ; and when he palmed himself off on 
the old count for an Italian master without my knowledge, nobody had heard of him at all. 

Therefore since I must satisfy your curiosity before 
anything else, and not dwell too long on the details 
the dear, commonplace details I will simply say 
that Nino succeeded without difficulty in arranging 
with the sacristan of the Pantheon to allow a party 
of foreigners to visit the building at the full moon, 
at midnight. I have no doubt he even expended a 
franc with the little man, who is very old and dirty, 
and keeps chickens in the vestibule but no details I 

On the appointed night Nino, wrapped in that old 
cloak of mine, which is very warm, though it is 
threadbare, accompanied the party to the temple, or 
church, or whatever you like to call it. The party 
were simply the count and his daughter, an Austrian 
gentleman of their acquaintance, and the dear baroness that sympathetic woman who broke so many 
hearts and cared not at all for the chatter of the people. Every one has seen her, with her slim, grace 
ful ways, and her face that was like a mulatto peach 
for darkness and fineness, and her dark eyes and 
tiger-lily look. They say she lived entirely on 
sweetmeats and coffee, and it is no wonder she was 
so sweet and so dark. She called me "count" 
which is very foolish now, but if I were going to fall 
in love I should have loved her. I should not love 
a statue. As for the Austrian gentleman, it is not 
of any importance to describe him. 

These four people Nino conducted to the little 
entrance at the back of the Pantheon, and the sac 
ristan struck a light to show them the way to the 
door of the church. Then he put out his taper, and 
let them do as they pleased. 

Conceive if you can the darkness of Egypt, the 
darkness that can be felt, impaled and stabbed 
through its whole thickness by one mighty moon 
beam, clear and clean and cold, from the top to the 
bottom. All around, in the circle of the outer 
black, lie the great dead in their tombs, whispering 
to each other of deeds that shook the world; whis 
pering in a language all their own as yet the lan 
guage of the life to come the language of a stillness 
so dread and deep that the very silence clashes against 
it, and makes dull, muffled beatings in ears that 
strain to catch the dead men's talk: the shadow of 
immortality falling through the shadow of death, and 
bursting back upon its heavenward course from the 
depth of the abyss ; climbing again upon its silver 



 

self to the sky above, leaving behind the horror of 
the deep. 

So in that lonely place at midnight falls the moon 
upon the floor, and through the mystic shaft of rays 
ascend and descend the souls of the dead. Hedwig 
stood out alone upon the white circle on the pavement beneath the dome, and looked up as though she 
could see the angels coming and going. And, as 
she looked, the heavy lace veil that covered her head 
fell back softly, as though a spirit wooed her and 
would fain look on something fairer than he, and 
purer. The whiteness clung to her face, and each 
separate wave of hair was like spun silver. And she 
looked steadfastly up. For a moment she stood, and 
the hushed air trembled about her. Then the silence 
caught the tremor, and quivered, and a thrill of 
sound hovered and spread its wings, and sailed forth 
from the night. 

"Spirto gentil dei sogni miei " 

Ah, Signorina Edvigia, you know that voice now, 
but you did not know it then. How your heart 
stopped, and beat, and stopped again, when you first 
heard that man sing out his whole heartful you in 
the light and he in the dark ! And his soul shot out 
to you upon the sounds, and died fitfully, as the 
magic notes dashed their soft wings against the 
vaulted roof above you, and took new life again and 
throbbed heavenward in broad, passionate waves, till 
your breath came thick and your blood ran fiercely 
ay, even your cold northern blood in very triumph that a voice could so move you. A voice in 
the dark. For a full minute after it ceased you stood 



 

there, and the others, wherever they might be in the 
shadow, scarcely breathed. 

That was how Hedwig first heard Nino sing. 
When at last she recovered herself enough to ask 
aloud the name of the singer, Nino had moved quite 
close to her. 

" It is a relation of mine, signorina, a young fellow who is going to be an artist. I asked him as a 
favour to come here and sing to you to-night. I 
thought it might please you." 

" A relation of yours ! " exclaimed the contessina. 
And the others approached so that they all made a 
group in the disc of moonlight. "Just think, my 
dear baroness, this wonderful voice is a relation of 
Signor Cardegna, my excellent Italian master!" 
There was a little murmur of admiration ; then the 
old count spoke.
