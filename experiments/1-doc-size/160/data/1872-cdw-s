THE tip-top of the Villa Nardi is a flat roof, with a 
wall about it three feet high, and some little tur- 
reted afiairs, that look very much like chimneys. Joseph, 
the gray-haired servitor, has brought my chair and table 
up here to-day ; and here I am, established to write. 

I am here above most earthly annoyances, and on a 
level with the heavenly influences. It has always seemed 
to me that the higher one gets, the easier it must be to 
write ; and that, especially at a great elevation, one could 
strike into lofty themes, and launch out, without fear of 
shipwreck on any of the earthly headlands, in his aerial 
voyages. Yet, after all, he would be likely to arrive 
nowhere, I suspect ; or, to change the figure, to find, that, 
in parting with the taste of the earth, he had produced a 
flavorless composition. If it were not for the haze in the 
horizon to-day, I could distinguish the very house in 
Naples — that of Manso, Marquis of Villa — where Tasso 
found a home, and where John Milton was entertained 
at a later day by that hospitable nobleman. I wonder, 
if he had come to the Villa Nardi and written on the 
roof, if the theological features of his epic would have 
been softened, and if he would not have received new 
suggestions for the adornment of the garden. Of course, 
it is well that his immortal production was not composed 
on this roofj and in sight of these seductive shores, or it 
would have been more strongly flavored with classic 
mythology than it is. But, letting Milton go, it may be 
necessary to say, that my writing to-day has nothing to 
 


do with my theory of composition in an elevated posi- 
tion ; for this is the laziest place that I have yet found. 

I am above the highest olive-trees ; and, if I turned 
that way, should look over the tops of what seems a vast 
grove of them, out of which a white roof, and an old 
time-eaten tower here and there, appears ; and the sun 
is flooding them with waves of light, which I think a 
person delicately enough organized could hear beat. 
Beyond the brown roofs of the town, the terraced hilis 
arise, in semi-circular embrace of the plain ; and the fine 
veil over them is partly the natural shimmer of the heat, 
and partly the silver duskiness of the olive-leaves. I sit 
with my back to all this, taking the entire force of this 
winter sun; which is full of life and genial heat, and 
does not scorch one, as I remember such a full flood of it 
would at home. It is putting sweetness, too, into the 
oranges ; which, I observe, are" getting redder and softer 
day by day. We have here, by the way, such a habit 
of taking up an orange, weighing it in the hand, and 
guessing if it is ripe, that the test is extending to other 
things. I saw a gentleman this morning, at breakfast, 
weio-hino- an eofs in the same manner; and some one 
asked him if it was ripe. 

It seems to me that the Mediterranean was never 
bluer than it is to-day. It has a shade or two the advan- 
tage of the sky : though I like the sky best, after all ; for 
it Is less opaque, and offers an illimitable opportunity of 
exploration. Perhaps this is because I am nearer to it. 
There are some little ruffles of air on the sea, which I 
do not feel here, making broad spots of shadow, and here 
and there flecks and sparkles. But the schooners sail 
idly ; and the fishing-boats that have put out from the 
marina float in the most dreamy manner. I fear that 
the fishermen who have made a show of industry, and 
got away from their wives, who are busily weaving nets 
on shore, are yielding to the seductions of the occasion, 
and making a day of it. And, as I look at them, I found 
myself debating which I would rather be, a fisherman 
 

there in the boat, rocked by the swell, and warmed by 
the sun, or a friar, on the terrace of the garden on the 
summit of Deserto, lying perfectly tranquil, and also 
soaked in the sun. There is one other person, now that 
I think of it, who may be having a good time to-day, 
though I do not know as I envy him. His business is a 
new one to me, and is an occupation that one would not 
care to recommend to a friend until he had tried it : it is 
being carried about in a basket. As I went up the new 
Massa road the other day, I met a ragged, stout, and 
rather dirty woman, with a large shallow basket on her 
head. In it lay her husband, — a large man, though I 
think a little abbreviated as to his legs. The woman 
asked alms. Talk of Diogenes in his tub ! How must 
the world look to a man in a basket, riding about on his 
wife's head ? When I returned, she had put him down 
beside the road in the sun, and almost in danger of the 
passing vehicles. I suppose that the affectionate creature 
thought, that, if he got a new injury in this way, his 
value in the beggar market would be increased. I do 
not mean to do this exemplary wife any injustice ; and I 
only suggest the idea in this land, where every beggar 
who is born with a deformity has something to thank the 
Virgin for. This custom of carrying your husband on 
your head in a basket has something to recommend it, 
and is an exhibition of faith on the one hand, and of 
devotion on the other, that is seldom met with. Its 
consideration is commended to my countrywomen at 
home. . It is, at least, a new commentary on the apos- 
tolic remark, that the man is the head of the woman. 
It is, in some respects, a happy division of labor in the 
walk of life : she furnishes the locomotive power, and he 
the directing brains, as he lies in the sun and looks 
abroad ; which reminds me that the sun is getting hot 
on my back. The little bunch of bells in the convent 
tower is jangling out a suggestion of worship, or of the 
departure of the hours. It is time to eat an orange. 
Vesuvius appears to be about on a level with my eyes ; 



and I never knew him to do himself more credit than to- 
day. The whole coast of the bay is in a sort of obscura- 
tion, thicker than an Indian summer haze ; and the veil 
extends almost to the top of Vesuvius. But his summit 
is still distinct ; and out of it rises a gigantic billowy 
column of white smoke, greater in quantity than on any 
previous day of our sojourn ; and the sun turns it to sil- 
ver. Above a long line of ordinary-looking clouds, float 
great white masses, formed of the sulphurous vapor. 
This manufacture of clouds in a clear, sunny day has an 
odd appearance ; but it is easy enough, if one has such 
a laboratory as Vesuvius. How it tumbles up the white 
smoke ! It is piled up now, I should say, a thousand 
feet above the crater, straight into the blue sky, — a 
pillar of cloud by day. One might sit here all day, 
watching it, listening the while to the melodious spring 
singing of the hundreds of birds which have come to 
take possession of the garden, receiving Southern re- 
enforcements from Sicily and Tunis every morning, and 
think he was happy. But the morning has gone ; and I 
have written nothing. 



 

IF ever a Northern wanderer could be suddenly trans- 
ported to look down upon the Piano di Sorrento, he 
would not doubt that he saw the Garden of the Hes- 
perides. The orange-trees cannot well be fuller : their 
branches bend with the weight of fruit. With the 
almond-trees in full flower, and with the silver sheen of 
the olive leaves, the oranges are apples of gold in pic- 
tures of silver. As I walk in these sunken roads, and 
between these high walls, the orange boughs everywhere 
hang over ; and, through the open gates of villas, I look 
down alleys of golden glimmer, roses and geraniums by 
the walk, and the fruit above, — gardens of enchantment, 
with never a dragon, that I can see, to guard them. 

All the highways and the byways, the streets and
