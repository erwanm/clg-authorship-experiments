Meantime, where is the agricultural fair and cattle- 
show ? You must know that we do these things differ- 
ently in Bavaria. On the fair-ground, there is very lit- 
tle to be seen of the fair. There is an enclosure where 
steam-engines are smoking and puffing, and threshing- 
machines are making a clamor ; where some big church- 
bells hang, and where there are a few stalls for horses 
and cattle. But the competing horses and cattle are 
led before the judges elsewhere ; the horses, for instance, 
by the royal stables in the city. I saw no such general 
exhibition of domestic animals as you have at your fairs. 
The horses that took the prizes were of native stock, a 
very serviceable breed, excellent for carriage-horses, and 
admirable in the cavalry service. The bulls and cows 
seemed also native and to the manor born, and were 
worthy of little remark. The mechanical, vegetable, 
and fruit exhibition was in the great glass palace, in the 
city, and was very creditable in the fruit department, — in 
the show of grapes and pears especially. The products 
of the dairy were less, though I saw one that I do not 
recollect ever to have seen in America, — a landscape in 
butter. Enclosed in a case, it looked very much like a 
wood-carving. There was a Swiss cottage, a milkmaid, 
with cows in the foreground ; there were trees, and in 
the rear rose rocky precipices, with chamois in the act 
of skipping thereon. I should think something might be 
done in our country in this line of the fine arts ; cer- 
tainly, some of the butter that is always being sold so 
cheap at St. Albans, when it is high everywhere else, 
must be strong enough to warrant the attempt. As to 
the other departments of the fine arts in the glass palace, 
I cannot give you a better idea of them than by saying 
that they were as well filled as the like ones in the 
American county fairs. There were machines for 
threshing, for straw-cutting, for apple-paring, and gene- 
rally such a display of implements as would give one a 
favorable idea of Bavarian agriculture. There was an 
interesting exhibition of live fish, great and small, of 

nearly every sort, I should think, in Bavarian waters. 
The show in the fire-department was so antiquated, that 
I was convinced that the people of Munich never intend 
to have any fires. 

The great day of the fete was Sunday, Oct. 5 ; for on 
that day the king went out to the fair-ground, and dis- 
tributed the prizes to the owners of the best horses, and, 
as they appeared to me, of the most ugly-colored bulls. 
The city was literally crowded with peasants and coun- 
try people ; the churches were full all the morning with 
devout -masses, which poured into the waiting beer- 
houses afterward with equal zeal. By twelve o'clock, 
the city began to empty itself upon the Theresien 
meadow ; and long before the time for the king to arrive 
— two o'clock — there were acres of people waiting for 
the performance to begin. The terraced bank, of which 
I have spoken, was taken possession of early, and held 
by a solid mass of people ; while the fair-ground proper 
was packed with a swaying concourse, densest near the 
royal pavilion, which was erected immediately on the 
race-course, and opposite the bank. 

At one o'clock the grand stand opposite to the royal 
one is taken possession of by a regiment band and by 
invited guests. All the space, except the race-course, 
is, by this time, packed with people, who watch the red 
and white gate at the head of the course with growing 
impatience. It opens to let in a regiment of infantry, 
which marches in and takes position. It swings, every 
now and then, for a solitary horseman, who gallops down 
the line in all the pride of mounted civic dignity, to the 
disgust of the crowd ; or to let in a carriage, with some 
over-dressed officer or splendid minister, who is entitled 
to a place in the royal pavilion. It is a people's fete 
and the civic officers enjoy one day of conspicuous 
glory. Now a majestic person in gold lace is set down; 
and now one in a scarlet coat, as beautiful as a flamingo. 
These driblets of splendor only feed the popular impa- 
tience. Music is heard in the distance, and a procession 







with colored banners is seen approaclimg from the city. 
That, like every thing else that is to come, stops beyond 
the c osed gate; and there it halts, ready to stream down 
before our lyes in a variegated pageant. The tmie goes 
on: the crowd gets denser, for there have been steady 
rivers of people pouring into the grounds for m?re than 
an hour. "The military bands pay m the lonn 
the peasants jabber in unmtelligible dialects the high 
functionaries in the royal stand are good enough to move 
around, and let us see how brave and majestic they aie. 
At last the firing of cannon announces the coming ot 
royalty. There is a commotion in the vast crowd yonder, 
the ea-erly-watched gates swing wide, and a well-mounted 
company of cavalry dashes down the turf, m unifor of 
liaht blue and gold. It is a citizen s company of bu ch- 
ers and bakers and candlestick-makers, which would do 
no discredit to the regular army. Driving close alter is 
a four-horse carriagewith two of the king's ministers; 
Ld then, at a rapid pace, six coal-black horses in sier 
harness, with mounted postilions, drawing  long, slen 
der, open carriage with one seat, m which ride the km- 
and his brotherr Prince Otto, come down the way, and 
are pulenp in front of the pavilion; while the cannon 
oarrlhe b S bells ring, all the flags of Bavaria, Prussia 
and Aus?riaron innum;rable polel, are blowing straight 
out tte band plays " God save the King," tl-P-P break 
into enthusiastic shouting, and the young king, thiowmg 
off his cloak, rises and stands m his carnage foi a 
moment bowino- right and left before he descends. He 
we"rrto-day the simple uniform of the citi-ns' com 
which has escorted him, and is consequently more plamly 
and neatly dressed than any one else on the Pattorm, — a 
Ull (say L feet), slender, gallant-looking young tellow 
of three and twenty, with an open face and a graceful 

manner. , . . ,  „ cfonrl  

But, when he has arrived, things again come to a stand , 

and we wait for an hour, and watch the thickening of 

the clouds, while the king goes from this to that delighted 





dignitary on the stand and converses. At the end of 
this time, there is a movement. A white dog has got 
into the course, and runs up and down between the 
 walls of people in terror, headed off by soldiers at 
either side of the grand stand, and finally, becoming 
desperate, he makes a dive for the royal pavilion. The 
consternation is extreme. The people cheer the dog and 
laugh : a white-handed official, in gold lace, and without 
his hat, rushes out to " shoo " the dog away, but is unsuc- 
cessful ; for the animal dashes between his legs, and 
approaches the royal and carpeted steps. More men of 
rank run at him, and he is finally captured and borne 
away ; and we all breathe freer that the danger to royalty 
is averted. At one o'clock six youths in white jackets, 
with clubs and coils of rope, had stationed themselves by 
the pavilion, but they did not go into action at this 
juncture ; and I thought they rather enjoyed the activity 
of the great men who kept off the dog. 

At lensth there was another stir : and the king de- 
scended from the rear of his pavilion, attended by his 
ministers, and moved about among the people, who made 
way for him, and uncovered at his approach. He spoke 
with one and another, and strolled about as his fancy 
took him. I suppose this is called mingling with the 
common people. After he had mingled about fifteen
