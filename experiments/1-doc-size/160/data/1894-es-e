daged in bed, he roamed through the past, 
out again into the future, ravening at the 
fate which had drawn him from that room 
before the will was signed, furious at the 
fatality which had prevented him from being 
there to receive Quain when he came, deter- 





mining even as he lay to land that highway- 
man in jail. 

The motor forces of human activity are 
gold and woman. It was the gold for 
which Quain had striven; the woman in 
the case was an incident. To Bancroft the 
woman was all. It was for her he was 
planning. And as his thoughts roamed 
forward and back, it was she that repre- 
sented the future. She might, he knew, 
never recompense him with more than a 
touch of the hand ; the embrace of her lithe 
white arms might be the destined bliss of 
another. But the love which little by little 
had grown within him until it mastered his 
being, though it gave no rights, brought 
duties, and those duties were every one to 
her. 

Of these duties, one, which the admission 
of the girl's father had made imperative, 
was the ablation from her heart of all affec- 
tion for Quain. 

Another was the prevention of further 
enterprise on the part of that brigand. 





To accomplish both, one thing was need- 
ful Quain's capture, prosecution, and im- 
prisonment. 

Unaware, indeed, that the spectacle which 
the girl had beheld had already enlightened 
her sufficiently, yet convinced that no one 
save himself now knew of the consanguinity 
which, had Mr. Attersol lived, would have 
prevented criminal proceedings, it was with 
the determination to let the assault go by 
the board, but to press the charge of forgery, that he finally fitted himself to receive 
a detective who, on presentation of the 
Philadelphia draft, had been employed to 
shadow Quain. 

The man who was then admitted did not, 
however, look like a detective. There was 
nothing of the Central Office about him. 
He looked shabby, but not genteel ; the 
air of one to whom the world owes a liv- 
ing and has shirked the debt. It was 
when he spoke that confidence came, for 
if uncertain of others he seemed quite 
sure of himself. 





" He has been too quick for us, Mr. 
Bancroft," he began, when the nurse had 
gone. " He was off before I got to his 
lodgings. It took me some time to discover 
he had come here. When I did, I followed. 
But he had cut again. It was then I learned 
what had occurred. Am I wrong in think- 
ing it has altered your intentions ? " 

" No. Before I wanted him shadowed. 
Now I want him sent up. You must find 
him, sergeant." 

" Will it be forgery, sir, or felonious 
assault ? " 

Bancroft stared. 

" You suspected, then " 

" I knew. But I knew too late. Which 
is it to be, sir, or is it to be both ? " 

" Forgery will do. Have you any idea 
where he is ? " 

" If I hadn't, I should not be here. It 
may take a little time, it may take longer, 
but in the end I can have him." 

" Very good, sergeant. Terms which are 
satisfactory to you will be entirely satisfactory to me. You will want something for 
your expenses, will you not ? " 

The detective coughed. 

" Hand me that cheque-book, will you, 
the red one on the table ; and the pen. 

" And now, sergeant," he continued, when 
the red book had been replaced, " how 
did you get your clew ? " 

" From the waiter in a restaurant where 
he went after leaving here." 

Bancroft closed his eyes. It seemed 
hap-hazard, the chance of capture remote. 
While the detective was off on a false trail 
perhaps, and he either pinioned where he 
was, or it might be recowered and at his 
Wall Street desk, what was there to pre- 
vent Quain from swooping down on Myrrha 
and carrying her off in his ape-like arms? 
What, indeed, unless he gave her the facts ? 
But at the moment she was in no condition 
to receive them. 

" Sergeant," he said suddenly, " money 
is of no moment in this matter, but it is an 
incentive. The sooner you arrest Quain 





the sooner you will get five thousand 
dollars." 

The detective rose from his seat, looked 
at his watch, and turned to the door. 

" There is a train at two for Providence. 
I may have him to-night." 

" If you do," Bancroft called after him, 
" I'll make it what you like." 

But not on that night nor on the sub- 
sequent one did any news of Quain's cap- 
ture reach him. A week passed, and then 
one morning, as he turned over the pages 
of the Herald, the following item sprang 
out and caressed his eye : 

LONDON, May 29. The Sidonia, from Boston, which 
arrived at Liverpool yesterday, reports that Oswald
