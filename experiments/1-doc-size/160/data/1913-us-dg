 

told her that all men were bad, and that 
no man was worthy of such a beautiful 
love, she was quite ravished, and wiped 
away tears from her eyes. 

It would have been a shame to spoil 
such a heavenly mood by telling the real 
truth. Instead, George contented him- 
self with telling of the new resolutions 
he had formed. After all, they were the 
things which really mattered; for Henriette 
was going to live with his future, not with 
his past. 

It seemed to George a most wonderful 
thing, this innocence of a young girl, 
which enabled her to move through a 
world of wickedness with unpolluted mind. 
It was a touching thing; and also, as a 
prudent young man could not help reahzing, 
a most convenient thing. He realized the 
importance of preserving it, and thought 
that if he ever had a daughter, he would 
protect her as rigidly as Henriette had been 
protected. He made haste to shy off from 
the subject of his '' badness'' and to turn 
the conversation with what seemed a clever 
jest. 



 

''If I am going to be so good' he said, 
"don't forget that you will have to be 
good also!'' 

"I will try," said Henriette, who was 
still serious. 

"You will have to try hard," he per- 
sisted. "You will find that you have a 
very jealous husband." 

"Will I?" said Henriette, beaming with 
happiness â€” 'for when a woman is very 
much in love she doesn't in the least 
object to the man's being jealous. 

"Yes, indeed," smiled George. "I'll 
always be watching you." 

"Watching me?" echoed the girl with 
a surprised look. 

And inmaediately he felt ashamed of 
himself for his jest. There could be no 
need to watch Henriette, and it was bad 
taste even to joke about it at such a time. 
That was one of the ideas which he had 
brought with him from his world of evil. 

The truth was, however, that George 
would always be a suspicious husband; 
nothing could ever change that fact, for 
there was something in his owti con- 



 

science which he could not get out, and 
which would make it impossible for him 
to be at ease as a married man. It was 
the memory of something which had hap- 
pened earlier in his life, before he met 
Lizette. There had been one earlier expe- 
rience, with the wife of his dearest friend. 
She had been much younger than her 
husband, and had betrayed an interest 
in George, who had yielded to the tempta- 
tion. For several years the intrigue con- 
tinued, and George considered it a good 
solution of a young man's problem. There 
had been no danger of contamination, 
for he knew that his friend was a man of 
pure and rigid morals, a jealous man who 
watched his wife, and did not permit her 
to contract those new relations which are 
always dangerous. As for George, he 
helped in this worthy work, keeping the 
woman in terror of some disease. He told 
her that almost all men were infected, for 
he hoped by this means to keep her from 
deceiving him. 

I am aware that this may seem a dreadful 
story. As I do not want anyone to think 



 

too ill of George Dupont, I ought, perhaps, 
to point out that people feel differently 
about these matters in France. In judging 
the unfortunate young man, we must 
judge him by the customs of his own 
country, and not by ours. In France, 
they are accustomed to what is called the 
manage de convenance. The young girl 
is not permitted to go about and make 
her own friends and decide which one of 
them she prefers for her husband; on the 
contrary, she is strictly guarded, her train- 
ing often is of a religious nature, and her 
marriage is a matter of business, to be 
considered and decided by her parents 
and those of the young man. Now, 
whatever we may think right, it is hu- 
manly certain that where marriages are 
made in that way, the need of men and 
women for sympathy and for passionate 
interest will often lead to the forming of 
irregular relationships after marriage. It 
is not possible to present statistics as to 
the number of such irregular relationships in 
Parisian society; but in the books which 
he read and in the plays which he saw, 



 

George found everything to encourage 
him to think that it was a romantic and 
delightful thing to keep up a secret intrigue 
with the wife of his best friend. 

It should also, perhaps, be pointed out 
that we are here telling the truth, and 
the whole truth, about George Dupont; 
and that it is not customary to tell this 
about men, either in real life or in novels. 
There is a great deal of concealment 
in the world about matters of sex; and 
in such matters the truth-telling man is 
apt to suffer in reputation in comparison 
with the truth-concealing one. 

Nor had George really been altogether 
callous about the thing. It had happened 
that his best friend had died in his arms; 
and this had so affected the guilty pair 
that they had felt their relationship was 
no longer possible. She had withdrawn
