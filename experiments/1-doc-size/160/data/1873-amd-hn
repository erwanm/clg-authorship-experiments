with words of sincerest welcome. 

It was stormy on Sunday, and Greta not being very 
well, neither of the girls went out. But Philip brought a 
report at noon. 

" You notice the changes most of all in church," he said. 
"Yet Mr. Kenneth's place seems to be well supplied, and 
there is no lack among the audience. But, O, the strange 
faces ! I can hardly imagine myself at Riverside." 

"But you are not sorry?" Madge asked, just under her 
breath. 

"Sorry! What put such an idea into your head, little 
sister? I enjoyed it all so much, kneeling in the old 
place, and remembering our childish wishes and vague 
aspirations, until I could not help thinking of Jacob at 
Bethel. If we ever made any vows, how scrupulously 
they ought to be fulfilled ! for God has brought us back 
in safety." 

Mr. Maurice, the clergyman, called the ensuing week, 
and they found him a Christian gentleman. He had met 
Jessie at Miss Hetty's, and heard part of their story; so he 
hardly appeared like a stranger. 

When they came to regular living, Madge was installed 
as housekeeper, as Eleanor's duties called her away three 
or four days in the week. But they could hardly consider 
themselves really settled until they had all the household 
back again. 

It was a month before Jessie returned, taking them 
quite by surprise one evening. How pretty she had 
grown, and how happy she looked ! It seemed as if Mr. 
Graham's smile was less grave, and the tender inflections 
of his voice touched Madge with a peculiar nearness to 
tears. 





" O," exclaimed Jessie, " how lovely it all it ! It gives 
one such a sense of home to walk np the avenue under the 
familiar trees, and have the doors open to you vistas of 
remembered pleasure ! You and Nelly have made a bower 
of this library." 

" It was Nelly's taste " 

" And Madge's labor," said Eleanor. 

Madge had worked indeed. The two large bronze lawn 
vases had been brought in, still rich with summer bloom 
and beauty, and stood at either side of the large bay- 
window, the English and German ivy trailing overhead in 
its shadowy greenness. Some rustic baskets, filled with 
mosses and clusters of scarlet berries amid the ferns, de- 
pended here and there. A little fire was burning in the 
grate, lending a ruddy glow, and through all there was a 
sense of warmth and home-tenderness, the sweet and fra- 
grant scents of woody growths, a quiver of leaves and 
depths of cool greenery, as if the recess opened into the 
hush of a forest at summer noon. 

Jessie could scarcely bear to leave it, but Madge had 
a hospitable desire to display the rest of the house. 

" We thought, Nelly and I, that you might like the 
rooms on this side, and we have kept ours as they were. 
Here is the dear old sitting-room. O, Jessie, you remem- 
ber that night, the last dear time we were all so happy 
together! Somehow I had not the heart to put it in 
order. For we shall never be quite the same again, and 
Nelly fancied that you might like it for some purpose. 
For, after all, the whole house is yours." 

"I do not look at it in that light. I believe Mrs. Rachel 
meant that I should do all the good and give all the pleas- 
ure that I could with her legacy. While papa and mamma 
live, it is to be their home, no matter what changes may 
come to the rest of us. I saw mamma to-day." 

" And she was delighted, I know. You heard the good 
news ? " 



 

" That papa's operation was satisfactory, so far ? Yes. 
O, Madge, my darling, it seems as if my life was one con- 
tinual thanksgiving! I wonder how so much happiness 
has come to me ! " 

The lustrous eyes and pure, sweet face were radiant with 
content. 

" One of us ought to be happy," said Madge, gravely. 

Jessie studied her sister's serious mood. Was there the 
shadow of some old pain making a pensive gloom in her 
heart ? 

" Are you satisfied to be here ? " she asked, timidly. 

" Quite. Don't think of that for a moment. Jessie, I 
saw them one Sunday. We came face to face, and they 
all recognized me politely. Since then he has been as one 
utterly lost to me not that there was any hope before, 
you know, only it was like a seal being placed on a coffin 
lid. I seem to understand how he has changed. But let 
it all go." 

Jessie read the underlying depth of pain that Madge 
had hidden. Her own life for the past month told her 
what her more demonstrative sister's hopes had been. 

They returned to the library, where the others were 
waiting, Philip and Mr. Graham in the midst of an ani- 
mated conversation. 

" O, and one thing I came near forgetting, Jessie. Old 
Mrs. Deane is dead. She sent last week for some of us 
to come, and I, being the only available person, went. She 
groaned a great deal over the deceitfulness of riches, and 
thought Mrs. Dormer ought to have given her money to 
a hospital. Then she was very much afraid your husband 
and your fortune would be a snare to lead you astray, and 
supposed that papa had completely lost his faculties by 
this time, and was desperately lugubrious over our affairs, 
What a miserable, unhappy being ! " 

Jessie sighed softly for the poor souls that went astray 
and wondered if they found heaven at the last. 







CHAPTER XXI. 

DAYS BUNNY AND SHADY. 

MADGE ASHBTJRTON, bright, restless, and excited, Jis 
gered by the window again, watching. The fire burned 
brightly, the tremulous leaves swung in the vine-covered 
window, shaking out a faint, summer-like perfume. El- 
eanor sat at the library table copying music, Greta was 
playing with her picture-book and talking to herself, and 
Jessie sewing. Madge, alone, could do nothing but 
watch. 

A carriage turned up the drive, and she flashed through 
the hall, down the steps, and stood in breathless expecta- 
tion, her cheeks flushed, her soft hair blown about by the
