Maisie, at this, emitted a low but length- 
ened sigh, a meagre note of reluctant assent, 
which would certainly have been amusing to 
an auditor. " Then there is n't anything 
else?" 

" I vow I don't quite see what there is." 

Maisie waited a moment. Her silence 
seemed to signify that she too had no al- 
ternative to suggest. But she made another 
appeal. " If I come here you 'll come and 
see me?" 

" I won't lose sight of you." 

"But how often will you come? " As he 





hung fire she pressed him. " Often and 
often?" 

Still he faltered. " My dear old woman ! " 
he began; then he paused again, going on 
the next moment with a change of tone. 
"You're too funny! Yes, then," he said, 
"often and often." 

"All right" and Maisie jumped out of 
the cab. Mrs. Beale was at home, but not 
in the drawing-room, and when the butler 
had gone for her the child suddenly broke 
out : " But when I 'm here what will Mrs. 
Wix do?" 

"Ah, you should have thought of that 
sooner ! " said her companion with the first 
faint hint of asperity she had ever heard him 
produce.

MRS. BEALE fairly swooped upon her, and 
the effect of the whole hour was to put be- 
fore her how much, how quite formidably 
indeed after all, she was loved. This was 
the more the case as her stepmother, so 
changed in the very manner of her mother 
that she really struck her as a new ac- 





quaintance, somehow recalled more famil- 
iarity than Maisie could feel. A rich, strong, 
expressive affection, in short, pounced upon 
her in the shape of a handsomer, nobler, 
older Mrs. Beale. It was like making a fine 
friend, and they had n't been a minute to- 
gether before she felt elated at the way she 
had met the choice imposed upon her in the 
cab. There was a whole future in the com- 
bination of Mrs. Beale's beauty and Mrs. 
Beale's hug. She seemed to Maisie charm- 
ing to behold, and also to have no connection 
at all with anybody who had once had meals 
in the nursery and mended underclothing. 
The child knew one of her father's wives 
was a woman of fashion, but she had always 
dimly made a distinction, not applying that 
epithet without reserve to the other. Mrs. 
Beale, since their separation, had acquired 
a conspicuous right to it, and Maisie's first 
flush of response to her present delight col- 
ored all her splendor with meanings that, 
this time, were sweet. She had told Sir 
Claude that she was afraid of the lady in 
the Regent's Park; but she was not too 
much afraid to rejoice aloud on the very 
spot. "Why, aren't you beautiful? Isn't 
she beautiful, Sir Claude isn't she?" 





" The handsomest woman in London, 
simply," Sir Claude gallantly replied. " Just 
as you 're the best little girl ! " 

Well, the handsomest woman in London 
gave herself up with tender, lustrous looks 
and every demonstration of fondness to a 
happiness at last recovered. There was al- 
most as vivid a bloom in her maturity as in 
mamma's, and it took her but a short time 
to give her little friend an impression of 
positive power an impression that opened 
up there like a new source of confidence. 
This was a perception on Maisie's part that 
neither mamma, nor Sir Claude, nor Mrs. 
Wix, with their immense and so varied re- 
spective attractions, had exactly kindled and 
that made an immediate difference when the 
talk, as it promptly did, began to turn to 
her father. Oh yes, Mr. Farange was a 
complication, but she saw now that he 
would not be one for his daughter. For 
Mrs. Beale certainly he was an immense 
one; she speedily made known as much: 
but Mrs. Beale from this moment presented 
herself to Maisie as a person to whom a 
great gift had come. The great gift was 
just for handling complications. Maisie ob- 
served how little she made of them when, 





after she had dropped, to Sir Claude, some 
reference to a previous meeting he ex- 
claimed with an air of consternation and yet 
with something of a laugh that he had de- 
nied to their companion their having, since 
the day he came for her, seen each other till 
that moment. 

Mrs. Beale diffused surprise. "Why did 
you do anything so silly?" 

" To protect your reputation." 

"From Maisie?" Mrs. Beale was much 
amused. " My reputation with Maisie is too 
good to suffer." 

" But you believed me, you rascal, did n't 
you?" Sir Claude asked of the child. 

She looked at him she smiled. " Her 
reputation did suffer. I discovered you had 
been here." 

He was not too chagrined to laugh. 
" The way, my dear, you talk of that sort of 
thing ! " 

" How should she talk," Mrs. Beale in- 
quired, " after all this ruinous time with 
her mother?" 

" It was not mamma who told me," Maisie
