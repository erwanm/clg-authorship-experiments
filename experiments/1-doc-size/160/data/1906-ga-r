and convalescence lasted for eight weeks. Then, 
in spite of the supplications of his friends, chief 
among whom was his faithful Jon, and the prohibition of the doctor, he began the second stage 
of his journey. 

The road from Yakutsk to Irkutsk, some two 
thousand six hundred versts, or fifteen hundred 
and fifty English miles, lay for the most part alternately on and along the river Lena in a south- 
easterly direction ; there being no attempt to cross 



 

Siberia at any point in a straight line. By this 
time the river was frozen, and the only concession 
Eezanov would make to his enfeebled frame was 
an arrangement to cover the entire journey by 
private sledge instead of employing the swifter 
course of post sledge on the long stretches and 
horseback on the shorter cuts. 

The weather was now intensely cold, the river 
winding, the delays many, but there were adequate 
stations for the benefit and accommodation of 
travellers every hundred versts or less. Rezanov 
felt so invigorated by the long hours in the open 
after the barbarous closeness of his sick room, 
that at the end of a fortnight he was again possessed with all his old ardor of desire to reach the 
end of his journey. He vowed he was well again, 
abandoned his comfortable sledge and pushed on 
in the common manner. In the wretched post 
sledges he was often exposed to the full violence 
of a Siberian winter, and although the horseback 
exercise stirred his blood and refreshed him for 
the moment, he suffered in reaction and was 
several times forced to remain two nights instead 
of one at a station. But he was muffled in sables 
to his very eyes, and the road was diverting, 
often beautiful, with its Gothic mountains, its 




white plains set with villages and farms, high thin 
crosses above the open or swelling domes of the 
little churches. Sometimes the Lena narrowed 
until its frozen surface looked like a mass of ice 
that had ground its way between perpendicular 
walls or overhanging masses of rock that awaited 
the next convulsion of nature to close the pass altogether. Then the dogs trotted past caves and 
grottos, left the abrupt and craggy banks, crossed 
level plains once more; where herds of cattle 
grazed in the summer time, now a vast uncheckered expanse of white. The Government and 
Company agents fawned upon him, the best of 
horses and beds, food and wine, were eagerly 
placed at the disposal of the favorite of the Tsar. 
Eezanov's spirit, always of the finest temper, suf- 
fered no eclipse for many days. He revelled in 
the belief that his sorely tried body was regenerating its old vigors. 

From Wercholensk to Katschuk the journey 
was so winding by river that it consumed more 
than twice the time of the land route, wliich al- 
though only thirty versts in extent was one of the 
most difficult in Siberia. Rezanov chose the latter 
without hesitation, and would listen to no dissuasion from the Commissary of the little town or 





from his distracted Jon : the journey from Yakutsk 
had now lasted five weeks and the servant 's watchful eye noted signs of exhaustion. 

The hills were very high and very steep, the 
roads but a name in smnmer. Had not the snow 
been soft and thin the horses could not have made 
the ascent at all; and as it was, the riders were 
forced to walk the greater part of the way and 
drag their unwilling steeds behind them. They 
were twelve hours covering the thirty versts, and 
at Katschuk Eezanov succumbed for two days, 
while Jon scoured the country in search of a 
telega; as sometimes happened there was a long 
stretch of country without snow, and sledges, by 
far the most comfortable method of travel in 
Siberia, could not be used. The rest of the 
journey, but one hundred and ninety-six versts, 
must be made by land. Eezanov admitted that 
he was too weary to ride, and refused to travel 
in the post carriage. On the third day the servant 
managed to hire a telega from a superior farmer 
and they started immediately, the heavy luggage 
having been consigned to a merchant vessel at 
Yakutsk. 

Eezanov stood the telega exactly half a day. 
Little larger than an arm-chair and far lighter. 




it was drawn by horses that galloped up and down 
hill and across the intervening valleys with no 
change of gait, and over a road so rough that the 
little vehicle seemed to be propelled by a succession of earthquakes. Eezanov, in a fever which 
he attributed to rage, dismissed the telega at a 
village and awaited the coming of Jon, who followed on horseback with the personal luggage. 

It was a village of wooden houses built in the 
Russian fashion, and inhabited by a dignified tribe 
wearing long white garments bordered with fur. 
They spoke Russian, a language little heard farther north and east in Siberia, and when Rezanov 
declined their hospitality they dispatched a courier at once to the Governor-General of Irkutsk 
acquainting him with the condition of the Cham- 
berlain and of his imminent arrival. In consequence, when Rezanov drew rein two days later 
and looked down upon the city of Irkutsk with its 
pleasant squares and great stone buildings beside the shining river, the gilded domes and 
crosses of its thirty churches and convents glittering in the sun, the whole picture beckoning to 
the delirious brain of the traveller like some 
mirage of the desert, his appearance was the 
signal for a salute from the fort; and the 



Governor-General, privy counsellor and senator 
de Pestel, accompanied by the civil governor, the 
commandant, and the archbishop, and with a military escort, sallied forth and led the guest, with 
the formality of officials and the compassionate 
tenderness of men, into the capital. 

For three weeks longer Rezanov lay in the 
palace of the Governor. Between fever and lassitude his iron will seemed alternately to melt in 
the fiery furnace of his body, then, a cooling but 
still viscous and formless mass, sink to the utmost 
depths of his being. But here he had the best of 
nursing and attendance, rallied finally and insisted upon continuing his journey. His doctor 
made the less demur as the travelling was far 
smoother now, in the early days of March, than 
it would be a month hence, when the snow was 
thinner and the sledges were no longer possible. 
Nevertheless, he announced his intention to accompany him as far as Krasnoiarsk, where the 
Chamberlain could lodge in the house of the principal magistrate of the place. Counsellor Keller, 
and be able to command fair nursing and medical 
attendance ; and to this Eezanov indifferently assented. 

The prospect of continuing his journey and the 



 

bustle of preparation raised the spirits of the invalid and gave him a fictitious energy. He had 
fought depression and despair in all his conscious 
moments, never admitted that the devastation in 
his body was mortal. With but a remnant of his 
former superb strength, and emaciated beyond 
recognition, he attended a banquet on the night 
preceding his departure, and on the following
