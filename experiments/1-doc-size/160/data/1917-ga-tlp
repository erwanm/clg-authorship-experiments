the United States of America might as well prepare to 
black the boots of Germany. 

When this war is over it is to be hoped that all the 
censors will be taken out and hanged. In view of the 
magnificent account of itself which Kitchener's Army 
has given since that miserable day, to say nothing of 
the fashion in which the British Navy lived up to its 
best traditions in that Battle of Jutland, it seems nothing short" of criminal that the English censor should 
have permitted the world to hold Great Britain in contempt for twenty-four hours and sink poor France in 
the slough of despond. However, he is used to abuse, 
and presumably does not mind it. 

On the following day he condescended to release 
the truth. We all breathed , again, and I kept one of 
my interesting engagements with Madame Pierre 
Goujon. 

ii 

This beautiful young woman's husband was killed 
during the first month of the war. Her brother was 
reported missing at about the same time, and although 
his wife has refused to go into mourning there is 
little hope that he will ever be seen alive again or that 
his body will be found. There was no room for doubt 
in the case of Pierre Goujon. . 

Perhaps if the young officer had died in the natural 



 

course of events his widow would have been over- 
whelmed by her loss, although it is difficult to imagine Madame Goujon a useless member of society at 
any time. Her brilliant black eyes and her eager 
nervous little face connote a mind as alert as Monsieur 
Reinach's. As it was, she closed her own home — she 
has no children — returned to the great hotel of her 
father in the Pare Monceau, and plunged into work. 

It is doubtful if at any period of the world's history 
men have failed to accept (or demand) the services 
of women in time of war, and this is particularly true 
of France, where women have always counted as units 
more than in any European state. Whether men have 
heretofore accepted these invaluable services with 
gratitude or as a matter-of-course is by the way. 
Never before in the world's history have fighting nations availed themselves of woman's co-operation in 
as wholesale a fashion as now ; and perhaps it is the 
women who feel the gratitude. 

Of course the first duty of every Frenchwoman in 
those distracted days of August, 1914, was, as I have 
mentioned before, to feed the poor women so suddenly thrown out of work or left penniless with large 
families of children. Then came the refugees pouring down from Belgium and the invaded districts of 
France; and these had to be clothed as well as fed. 

In common with other ladies of Paris, both French 
and American, Madame Goujon established ouvroirs 
after the retreat of the Germans, in order to give useful occupation to as many of the destitute women as 



 

possible. But when these were in running order she 
joined the Baroness Lejeune (born a Princess Murat 
and therefore of Napoleon's blood) in forming an 
organization both permanent and on the grand scale. 

The Baroness Lejeune also had lost her husband 
early in the war. He had been detached from his 
regiment and serit to the Belgian front to act as body- 
guard to the Prince of Wales. Receiving by a special 
messenger a letter from his wife, to whom he had 
been married but a few months, he separated himself 
from the group surrounding the English Prince and 
walked off some distance alone to read it. Here a 
bomb from a taube intended for the Prince hit and 
killed him instantly. 

Being widows themselves it was natural they should 
concentrate their minds on some organization that 
would be of service to other widows, poor women 
without the alleviations of wealth and social eminence, 
many of them a prey to black despair. Calling in 
other young widows of their own circle to help (the 
number was already appalling) , they went about their 
task in a business-like way, opening offices in the Rue 
Vizelly, which were subsequently moved to 20 Rue 
Madrid. 

When I saw these headquarters in May, 1916, the 
ceuvre was a year old and in running order. In one 
room were the high chests of narrow drawers one sees 
in offices and public libraries. These were for card 
indexes and each drawer contained the dossiers of 
widows who had applied for assistance or had been 



 

discovered suffering in lonely pride by a member of 
the committee. Each dossier included a methodical 
account of the age and condition of the applicant, of 
the number of her children, and the proof that her 
husband was either dead or "missing." Also, her own 
statement of the manner in which she might, if assisted, support herself. 

Branches of this great work — Association d'Aide 
aux Veuves Militaires de la Grande Guerre — have 
been established in every department of France; there 
is even one in Lille. The Central Committee takes 
care of Paris and environs, the number of widows 
cared for by them at that time being two thousand. 
No doubt the number has doubled since. 

In each of the rooms I visited a young widow sat 
before a table, and I wondered then, as I wondered 
many times, if all the young French widows Teally 
were beautiful or only created the complete illusion 
in that close black-hung toque with its band of white 
crepe just above the eyebrows and another from ear 
to ear beneath the chin. When the eyes are dark, the 
eyebrows heavily marked, no hair visible, and the profile regular, the effect is one of poignant almost sensational beauty. Madame Goujon looks like a young 
abbess. 

I do not wish to be cynical but it occurred to me 
that few of these young widows failed to be consoled 
when they stood before their mirrors arrayed for public view, however empty their hearts. Before I had 
left Paris I had concluded that it was the mothers who 



 

were to be pitied in this accursed war. Life is long 
and the future holds many mysteries for handsome 
young widows. Nevertheless the higher happiness is 
sometimes found in living with a sacred memory and 
I have an idea that one or two of these young widows 
I met will be faithful to their dead. 

Smooth as this oeuvre appeared on the surface it 
had not been easy to establish and every day brought 
its frictions and obstacles. The French temperament 
is perhaps the most difficult in the world to deal with, 
even by the French themselves. Our boasted individuality is merely in the primal stage compared with 
the finished production in France. Even the children 
are far more complex and intractable than ours. They 
have definite opinions on the subject of life, character, and the disposition of themselves at the age of six. 

Madame Goujon told me that every widow in need 
of help, no matter how tormented or however worthy, 
had to be approached with far more tact than possible 
donors, and her idiosyncrasies studied and accepted 
before anything could be done with her, much less
