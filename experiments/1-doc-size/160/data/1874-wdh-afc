wish I could ask you to sit down again ; but I have 
an engagement which I must make haste to keep. 
Are you going out through the campo ? Pray wait 
a minute, and I will walk with you." 

Mr. Ferris went into another room, through the 
open door of which Don Ippolito saw the parapher 
nalia of a painter's studio : an easel with a half- 
finished picture on it ; a chair with a palette and 
brushes, and crushed and twisted tubes of colors ; a 
lay figure in one corner ; on the walls scraps of 
stamped leather, rags of tapestry, desultory sketches 
on paper. 

Mr. Ferris came out again, brushing his hat. 

" The Signer Console amuses himself with paint 
ing, I see," said Don Ippolito courteously. 

Not at all," replied Mr. Ferris, putting on his 
gloves ; " I am a painter by profession, and I amuse 
myself with consuling ; ? and as so open a matter 
needed no explanation, he said no more about it. 
Nor is it quite necessary to tell how, as he was one 

Since these words of Mr. Ferris were first printed, I have been told 
that a more eminent painter, namely Rubens, made very much the same 
reply to very much the same remark, when Spanish Ambassador in 
England. "The Ambassador of His Catholic Majesty, I see, amuses 
himself by painting sometimes," said a visitor who found him at his 
easel. "I amuse myself by playing the ambassador sometimes." an 
swered Rubens. In spite of the similarity of the speeches, I let that of 
Mr. Ferris stand, for I am satisfied that he did not know how unhand 
somely Rubens had taken the words out of his mouth. 



 

day painting in New York, it occurred to him to 
make use of a Congressional friend, and ask for 
some Italian consulate, he did not care which. That 
of Venice happened to be vacant : the income was 
a few hundred dollars ; as no one else wanted it, 
no question was made of Mr. Ferris's fitness for 
the post, and he presently found himself possessed 
of a commission requesting the Emperor of Austria 
to permit him to enjoy and exercise the office of 
consul of the ports of the Lombardo- Venetian king 
dom, to which the President of the United States 
appointed him from a special trust in his abilities 
and integrity. He proceeded at once to his post 
of duty, called upon the ship's chandler with whom 
they had been left, for the consular archives, and 
began to paint some Venetian subjects. 

He and Don Ippolito quitted the Consulate to 
gether, leaving Marina to digest with her noonday 
porridge the wonder that he should be walking 
amicably forth with a priest. The same spectacle 
was presented to the gaze of the campo, where they 
paused in friendly converse, and were seen to part 
with many politenesses by the doctors of the neigh 
borhood, lounging away their leisure, as the Vene 
tian fashion is, at the local pharmacy. 

The apothecary craned forward over his counter, 
and peered through the open door. " What is that 
blessed Consul of America doing with a priest? " 

" The Consul of America with a priest ? " de 
manded a grave old man, a physician with a beauti- 



ful silvery beard, and a most reverend and senatorial 
presence, but one of the worst tongues in Venice. 
" Oh ! " he added, with a laugh, after scrutiny of 
the two through his glasses, " it's that crack-brain 
Don Ippolito Rondinelli. He isn 't  priest enough 
to hurt the consul. Perhaps he's been selling him 
a perpetual motion for the use of his government, 
which needs something of the kind just now. Or 
maybe he's been posing to him for a picture. He 
would make a very pretty Joseph, give him Poti- 
phar's wife in the background," said the doctor, who 
if not maligned would have needed much more to 
make a Joseph of him. 



II. 



MR. FERRIS took his way through the devious 
footways where the shadow was chill, and through 
the broad campos where the sun was tenderly warm, 
and the towers of the church rose against the speck- 
less azure of the vernal heaven. As he went along, 
he frowned in a helpless perplexity with the case 
of Don Ippolito, whom he had begun by doubting 
for a spy with some incomprehensible motive, and 
had ended by pitying with a certain degree of 
amusement and a deep sense of the futility of his 
compassion. He presently began to think of him 
with a little disgust, as people commonly think of 
one whom they pity and yet cannot help, and he 
made haste to cast off the hopeless burden. He 
shrugged his shoulders, struck his stick on the 
smooth paving-stones, and let his eyes rove up and 
down the fronts of the houses, for the sake of the 
pretty faces that glanced out of the casements. 
He was a young man, and it was spring, and this 
was Venice. He made himself joyfully part of the 
city and the season ; he was glad of the narrowness 
of the streets, of the good-humored jostling and 
pushing ; he crouched into an arched doorway to 
let a water-carrier pass with her copper buckets 


dripping at the end of the yoke balanced on her 
shoulder, and he returned her smiles and excuses 
with others as broad and gay ; he brushed by the 
swelling hoops of ladies, and stooped before the 
unwieldy burdens of porters, who as they staggered 
throuo-h the crowd with a thrust here and a shove 

there forgave themselves, laughing, with " We are 
in Venice, signori ; " and he stood aside for the files 
of soldiers clanking heavily over the pavement, their 
muskets kindling to a blaze in the sunlit campos and 
quenched again in the damp shadows of the calles. 
His ear was taken by the vibrant jargoning of 
the boatmen as they pushed their craft under the 
bridges he crossed, and the keen notes of the cana 
ries and the songs of the golden-billed blackbirds 
whose cages hung at lattices far overhead. Heaps 
of oranges, topped by the fairest cut in halves, 
gave their color, a!- frequent intervals, to the dusky 
corners and recesses and the long-drawn cry of the 
venders, " Oranges of Palermo ! " rose above the 
clatter of feet and the clamor of other voices. At 
a little shop where butter and eggs and milk 
abounded, together with early flowers of various 
sorts, he bought a bunch of hyacinths, blue and 
white and yellow, and he presently stood smelling 
these while he waited in the hotel parlor for the 
ladies to whom he had sent his card. He turned at 
the sound of drifting drapery, and could not forbear 
placing the hyacinths in the hand of Miss Florida 
Vervain, who had come into the room to receive 
him.
