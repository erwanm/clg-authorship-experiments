ace Greeley didn't rise up before me. One of 
the first questions asked by any camp-fire is, 
" Did ye ever see Horace ? " 

HERBERT. Which shows the power of the 
press again. But I have often remarked how 
little real conception of the moving world, as it 
is, people in remote regions get from the news 
paper. It needs to be read in the midst of 
events. A chip cast ashore in a refluent eddy 
tells no tale of the force and swiftness of the 
current. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I don't exactly get the 
drift of that last remark ; but I rather like a 
remark that I can't understand ; like the land 
lady's indigestible bread, it stays by you. 

HERBERT. I see that I must talk in words of 
one syllable. The newspaper has little effect 
upon the remote country mind, because the remote country mind is interested in a very limited 
number of things. Besides, as the Parson says, 
it is conceited. The most accomplished scholar 
will be the butt of all the guides in the woods, 



 







because he cannot follow a trail that would puz 
zle a sable (saple the trappers call it). 

THE PARSON. It's enough to read the sum 
mer letters that people write to the newspapers 
from the country and the woods. Isolated from 
the activity of the world, they come to think 
that the little adventures of their stupid days 
and nights are important. Talk about that 
being real life ! Compare the letters such peo 
ple write with the other contents of the news 
paper, and you will see which life is real. That 's 
one reason I hate to have summer come, the 
country letters set in. 

THE MISTRESS. I should like to see some 
thing the Parson doesn't hate to have come. 

MANDEVILLE. Except his quarter's salary, 
and the meeting of the American Board. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. I don't see that we are 
getting any nearer the solution of the original 
question. The world is evidently interested in 
events simply because they are recent. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I have a theory that a 
newspaper might be published at little cost, 
merely by reprinting the numbers of years be- 



 

fore, only altering the dates ; just as the Parson 
preaches over his sermons. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. It 's evident we must 
have a higher order of news-gatherers. It has 
come to this, that the newspaper furnishes 
thought-material for all the world, actually pre 
scribes from day to day the themes the world 
shall think on and talk about. The occupation 
of news-gathering becomes, therefore, the most 
important. When you think of it, it is aston 
ishing that this department should not be in the 
hands of the ablest men, accomplished scholars, 
philosophical observers, discriminating selectors 
of the news of the world that is worth thinking 
over and talking about. The editorial com 
ments frequently are able enough, but is it 
worth while keeping an expensive mill going to 
grind chaff? I sometimes wonder, as I open my 
morning paper, if nothing did happen in the 
twenty-four hours except crimes, accidents, defal 
cations, deaths of unknown loafers, robberies, 
monstrous births, say about the level of po 
lice-court news. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I have even noticed that 



 

murders have -deteriorated ; they are not so high- 
toned and mysterious as they used to be. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. It is true that the news 
papers have improved vastly within the last 
decade. 

HERBERT. I think, for one, that they are 
very much above the level of the ordinary gos 
sip of the country. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. But I am tired of having 
the under-world still occupy so much room in 
the newspapers. The reporters are rather more 
alert for a dog-fight than a philological conven 
tion. It must be that the good deeds of the 
world outnumber the bad in any given day ; 
and what a good reflex action it would have 
on society if they could be more fully reported than the bad ! I suppose the Parson 
would call this the Enthusiasm of Humanity . 

THE PARSON. You 'll see how far you can 
lift yourself up by your boot-straps. 

HERBERT. I wonder what influence on the 
quality (I say nothing of quantity) of news the 
coming of women into the reporter's and editor's 
work will have. 



 

OUR NEXT DOOR. There are the baby-shows ; 
they make cheerful reading. 

THE MISTRESS. All of them got up by specu 
lating men, who impose upon the vanity of weak 
women. 

HERBERT. I think women reporters are more 
given to personal details and gossip than the 
men. When I read the Washington correspond 
ence I am proud of my country, to see how 
many Apollo Belvederes, Adonises, how much 
marble brow and piercing eye and hyacinthine 
locks, we have in the two houses of Con 
gress. 

THE YOUNG LADY. That 's simply because 
women understand the personal weakness of 
men ; they have a long score of personal flat 
tery to pay off too. 

MANDEVILLE. I think women will bring in el 
ements of brightness, picturesqueness, and purity 
very much needed. Women have a power of 
investing simple ordinary things with a charm ; 
men are bungling narrators compared with them.
