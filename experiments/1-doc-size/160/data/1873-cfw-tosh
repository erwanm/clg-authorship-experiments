attention," said Hugh, taking another paper from 
the basket, " is a grave and scholarly essay upon 
that momentous subject, ambition. After the 
story and the poem, no doubt our minds will re- 
ceive much enjoyment from the contemplation 
of this instructive theme : — 

 AMBITION. 

Ambition is the curse of nations. 

If it was not for ambition, America would be .a 
better country. 

Ambition is wrong. ' 

Americans are very ambitions. 

It is always better to be content with what we 
have got. 

Especially when we have got so much. 

It is not right to be too ambitious. 

It is said we are going to have Cuba, Mexico 
and Canada. 

Of course we can have them if we want to. 

Or anything else. 



 

But we must always remember that ambition 
is wrong. Thomas Morris.' " 

" Very good, my boy," said Mr. Gay to Tom, 
whose scarlet face had betrayed the authorship 
of this profound essay long before his name was 
read; "adhere to that moral, and, mark my 
words, you will — never be President of the 
United States." 

Tom's embarrassment checked the smiles of 
the audience, and Hugh took up another 
paper. " Ah ! " he said with enthusiasm, " this 
seems to be a poem in earnest, breathing the real 
afflatus, written with the pen of Melpomene ! 
With your permission, ladies and gentlemen, I 
will refresh myself with a glass of water before I 
begin : — 

'A JUNE LYRIC. 

After all, not to labor only, — 
But to breathe in the essence of vivified sheen, 
The fragrance of rarefied thoughts as they surge to and 

fro, 
Heaving the unknown depths up to mountains of light, 

Crystalline, luminous, rare, opalescently rare, — 
Graham Mark.'" 

This, — this is June ! 



" Ah, blank verse," said Sibyl to her compan- 
ion, with admiring interest. He bowed and 
stroked his moustache with a dreamy air. 

" Very blank, I should say," murmured Bessie 
to Mr. Gay. 

" It seems to me as though I had heard the be- 
ginning of it before, somewhere," answered the 
Boston bachelor in the same tone. 

" The next contribution consists of a series of 
illustrations," said Hugh, unfastening some loose 
sheets of drawing paper ; " the following intro- 
duction is appended : — 

" The hand is not only an index of character, 
but it has a character of its own. We may dis- 
guise or droll our features, cultivate our voices 
and expression, but our hands betray us ; I pro- 
pose to illustrate this principle by a series of 
sketches. To begin : when you see an irregular 
hand with large, broad palm, strong wrist, but 




shapely, tapering fingers, you may know that 
hand betokens a duplex temperament, where op- 
posite characteristics are constantly struggling 
for the mastery. The palm may denote strength 
and industry, but the fingers may overbalance 
these qualities by their love of ease or generous 
prodigality. For instance, when you see a hand 
of this nature, you may know that its owner 
might give you half his fortune, might even give 
you his life, and yet would be very likely to keep 
the household in discomfort for months, for want 
of one new shingle on the roof. In short, my 
friends, you might know it was — ' " 

Here the reader paused, and held up a large 
drawing of two hands, so lifelike and alive with 
character that the whole company cried out with 
one voice, " Hugh ! " 

"Rather embarrassing for the editor," said 
Hugh, hastening on with his task as the laughter 
subsided. " Here, my friends is another design. ' 
When you see a hand proportioned in careful 
outlines, beautiful, but also firm ; white, but also 



 

strong to the playing of a sonata, you may know 
the owner will be prompt, even-tendered and 
calm ; you may know the owner will be such a 
one as — " here Hugh held up another design ; 
" Sibyl ! " said the audience, as the two hands 
appeared. 

Mr. Leslie rose, and crossed the room to ex- 
amine the drawing ; he did not lay it aside, but 
carried it back to his seat, as though it was the 
most natural thing in the world. Sibyl's color 
rose, but she turned with marked interest to- 
wards Graham Marr, and listened to his remarks 
with a bright smile. 

" The next design," Hugh read, " requires no 
explanation. It is the strong, broad, long palm, 
and strong, long, shapely fingers of the well- 
balanced, resolute man, who will fight the battle 
of life with all his strength, and never give up 
until it is won. In short, it is — " 

" Mr. Leslie ! " said the audience, as the illustra- 
tion was held up for inspection. Sibyl's eyes 
brightened as she saw the life-like picture, but 

she sat silent as the others poured forth criticisms 
and comments.
