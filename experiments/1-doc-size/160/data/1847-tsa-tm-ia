who gives his book or his top away, cannot re- 
claim it again. Do you understand, Henry .'" 

" O yes, ma'am, I understand. I'm not going to 
give any body my top, I know." 

"Very well, my son. You can do so if you 
wish. But remember, after you have once given 
it away, you cannot get it back again." 

"Why can't I, mother ?" asked the little boy. 

" Because, after you have given any thing away, 
it is no lonoer vours." 



 

" I'm not going to give it away," he said, in a 
positive voice, as he ran off to spin his top in the 
play room. 

For about an hour Clarence was very much inte- 
rested in his book, while Henry continued to spin 
his top with undiminished pleasure. After this 
time the interest of Clarence began to flag, and the 
sound of Henry's humming top came more and 
more distinctly to his ears from the adjoining room. 
At last he closed the book and sought his brother. 

'' Let me spin it once, won't you, Henry ?" he 
said. 

" Yes, I will," returned the generous-minded 
boy, and instantly handed the top and cord to 
Clarence, who wound it up, and sent it humming 
and skipping about the floor at a grand rate. 

Henry reached out iiis hand for the cord, but his 
brother held it back, saying, 

"Just let me spin it once more." 

" Well, you may once more," was replied. 

But it was " once more," and " once more," 
until Henry's tears restored to him his toy. 

"You are a selfish fellow," said Clarence, as he 
flung the top and cord at his brother's feet. 

Clarence did not resume his book, but stood 
looking at Henry's top, as he spun it, with a covet- 
ous expression on his face. 



 

"If you'll let me spin your top, you may read 
my book," he at length said. 

" I will," quickly returned Henry. 

The top and book were exchanged, and, for a 
time, both were well pleased. But the book was 
rather beyond the grasp of Henry's mind. He 
tired of it soon. 

"You may have your book now, Clarence. — 
I'm done reading it. Give me my top, won't you .'" 

" I'm not done with it yet. I let you read my 
book until you were tired, and now you must let 
me spin your top until I am tired." 

Henry rarely contended with his brother. He 
did not like contention. Knowing how resolute 
Clarence was in doing any thing that suited his 
humor, he said no more, but went and sat down 
quietly upon a litde chair, and looked on wishfully 
while Clarence spun his top. 

It was half an hour before Henry again got pos- 
session of his top; but the zest with which he had 
at first played with it was gone. Afier throwing it 
for a few times he said — 

" Here, Clarence, you may have it. I don't 
-want it." 

" May I have it for good .'" eagerly asked Cla- 
rence. 

'' Yes, for good." 



 

"You'll want it back." 

" No, I won't. You may keep it for ever." 

Clarence took possession of the top with right 
good will, and went on spinning it to his heart's 
content. After dinner Henry wanted it back again, 
and when his brother refused to give it up, went 
crying to his mother. Mrs. Hartley called up 
Clarence, and asked him why he did not give 
Henry his top. 

" It isn't his top, mother ; it is mine," said 
Clarence. 

" Yours ! How came it yours ." 

" Henry gave it to me." 

" Did you give it to him, Henry ?" 

"Yes, ma'am, this morning.: But it's my top, 
and I want it." 

"No, it is not your top any longer if you have 
given it to Clarence. It is his, and he must keep 
it. Have you forgotten what I told you when [ 
gave it to you. If you give away your things, 
they are no longer yours, and you cannot expect 
to get them back again. I hope, my son, that, 
hereafter, you will be more careful what you 
do." 

Henry cried bitterly, but his mother would not 
compel Clarence, upon whom Henry's tears had 
no effect, to restore the toy. The poor litde fel- 



 

low's lieart was almost broken at this hard lesson 
in the school of human life. 

In about a week, Mrs. Hartley tried it over again. 
Gifts were made to the children, and soon Clarence 
\vent to work to get possession of what his brother 
had. But Henry had not forgotten the top, and 
vas, therefore, not quite so generous as before. 
He withstood every effort for the first day. On 
the second, however, he yielded. On the follow- 
ing day he reclaimed his toys ; but his mother in- 
terposed again, and maintained Clarence's right to 
what Henry had given him. 

The poor child seemed unable to comprehend 
the justice of this decision, and grieved so much 
about it, that Mrs. Hartley felt unhappy. But ulti- 
mate good, she was sure, would be the result,
