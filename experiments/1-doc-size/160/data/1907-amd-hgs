were with them, and sisters, also. One girl 
she remembered as a last summer senior who 
was evidently instilling fortitude into an ir- 
resolute face that betrayed hesitancy in every 
line. 

“ Another sacrifice,” thought Helen. “ She 
will never make a college girl." 

Leslie Brooks stood on the platform, and 
grasped her hand warmly. 

“ I came last evening,” she announced, 
“ and was down to meet the noon train. 
We’re filling up fast. Girls are entering for 
the second year, several of them from other 
places. Jarvis Hall will overflow. Our fame 
has gone abroad.” 

A group was standing uncertainly, and 
Leslie approached them. 

“ It's such an awful big place ! ” declared 
a young woman in amazement. “ And such 
beautiful buildings and grounds! We’re from 
the West, and everything is strange. Where 
ought we to go? I hate to seem so ignorant. 
I’ve been teaching in a seminary, too.” 

Leslie made a few inquiries and piloted 



them to a place of refuge until their standing 
was established, explaining to them where 
they were to go for examinations, which were 
in progress now and would be for several 
days. 

“ I thought you lived in little houses, a 
dozen or so girls together,” said another. “ I 
read about it in a story.” 

“ It is considered better to live in the halls, 
though some do go outside. You will soon 
get acquainted. Many of the girls are just as 
much strangers as you. Come this way.” 

“ Are you one of the teachers? ” 

“ Oh, no!” 

“ I thought you looked young for a teacher. 
I’m twenty-four. That isn’t too old to begin, 
is it? I’ve been teaching to get enough money 
together; I’ve always wanted to go to college, 
and we six girls are all friends.” 

“ I’m glad you know some one,” returned 
Leslie. “ That is a cheerful outlook.” 

“ It’s hard in the beginning, isn’t it?” said 
Leslie to Helen. 

“ I found you in the beginning,” returned 
Llelen, with gratitude shining in her eyes. 


 

They went to the Seniors’ Hall. That, too, 
was filling up, and trunks and boxes stood 
about in the corridors. There were glad 
greetings and welcomes, bits of splendid vaca- 
tions, and wretched ones wthout a bit of fun, 
dismal anticipations of the thorny path before 
them, a wonder if the seniors could have as 
much fun as the juniors, and one girl said : 

“ The sophs is the place for pure, un- 
adulterated fun. You have gotten over the 
scare of the profs., and the girls’ snubs, for 
you find they are no better or wiser than you, 
and you just don’t care whether you get in 
the juniors or not. I wish I'd slipped up on 
more problems and stayed there another 
year.” 

“What a curious hodgepodge it all is!" 
declared Helen, her eyes twinkling with mirth. 
“ It sounds like reading across the columns of 
a newspaper, as the sentences and complaints 
break in upon one another, but if you waited 
for one or two to finish, you would never get 
a chance yourself.” 

“ Let us go to our room and put things in 
order. I have a nice, new rug that will look 




very well, though it was a heart-break for my 
new sister-in-law. They had been furnishing 
simply and prettily in soft grays and browns, 
with a bit of lovely red for contrast, and this 
queer blue killed everything. It was terrible, 
so we just changed off with some articles I 
was going to pack away. I think Miss Bond 
will want to buy it, she is so fond of bizarre 
effects, but we will use it for awhile. ” 

It was rather a queer pattern, with some- 
thing that suggested Chinese dragons crawl- 
ing about, but which were only impossible 
growths of sedgy blooms that must have 
grown in a blue and yellow sea. 

“ It really made the poor girl nervous. I 
can’t see any sense in such things. But we 
will put the lounge across the corner with the 
bookcase back of it. I don’t like my books too 
handy, selfish mortal that I am. You see, this 
will make quite a cosy corner with the orna- 
ments and hangings.” 

“ Why, it will be very artistic, and we will 
tread the dragons underfoot.” 

They worked industriously for awhile, 
Leslie breaking out now and then with enthu- 


 

siasm over her visit to Miss Craven. There 
was a tap at the door. 

“ That’s the tenth girl I've refused,” began 
Leslie impatiently. “ Hammer and nails and 
tack drawer and needles and thread. Oh!” 
in delighted surprise. “ Miss Morse, is my 
face full of all ungracious lines? You are 
doubly welcome,” and she caught the out- 
stretched hand in both of hers. 

“ Were you indulging in tempers ? It 
couldn't have been very bad,” smilingly. 

“ Please have a subject given out for the 
first public essay on ‘ The Evils of Borrow- 
ing.’ ” 


“ And the worse evil of never returning,” 
laughed Helen, her face radiant with pleasure.
