in literary Boston, was Celia Thaxter. 

She had, if not more leisure, perhaps more 
temperament and, at all events, more strength 
for social life than some others of the group ; 
and she was always sure of a welcome which, 
in itself, was a great temptation to earn it. 
She was the best of good company. Every 
body wanted her. Hearty, happy, wholesome, 
she rose through a decorous drawing-room or 
sedate library, like a breeze from her own 
island waves. When she had gone, one felt as 
if an East wind had suddenly died down. 

She was the most fearless, the most independent 
of beings. It mattered little to her what 
other people did or thought ; at least, on 
secondary subjects. She was never afraid to be her 
self. To certain modulations of manner she 
never consented. " Celia Thaxter's laugh " is 
well remembered. No subdued and conventional 
mirth softly rippled from her broad chest 
and honest larynx. When she laughed, she 
pealed. This merry ring was infectious. It 
was as impossible to hear it, and not laugh too, 
as it is for the feet that love dance music to 
keep still before it. She was the incarnation of 
good spirits. 

Her vigorous physique had much to do with 
this, for she had her share of the sorrows of 
life. These she bore characteristically, with 
out much complaint, with some suppressed 
cynicism, and with that bubbling faith in 
brighter futures so easy to the sanguine nature. 

I knew her as one does a comrade with whom 
one is never intimate ; but whom one regards 
affectionately, and whose history one makes 
guesses at, or forms opinions of, from a definite 
distance. I do not offer of her, in any sense, 
the reminiscences of a confidential friend. 

Once, I remember, I vexed her by something 
in a letter which I wrote her apropos of a religious 
discussion that we had held, in an interrupted 
form. She was then at the bitterest turn in 
the long avenue that leads through defiance to 
acceptance of religious truth. But she forgave 
me, I think, I am sure I did her, and I 
am very sure that in the later years of her life 
she would have given the plea of any Christian 
a different reception. I did not know her 

intimately enough to say just how far the 
growth of her religious character carried her, in 
intellectual form, and I have no right to mark 
its boundaries. But I think the longing for it 
was always in her. 

"If I believed as you do," she said to me 
once, fiercely, " nothing would daunt me ! 
Nothing would daunt me ! " 

I was present one day when she was describ 
ing to a .little group a wreck off Appledore : 
how she sat at her window, watching one of the 
cruelest gales of the midwinter Atlantic gather 
its forces. The breakers upon her own rocks 
were at their worst. A solitary sail blurred 
on the racing horizon, and beat up ; the vessel 
struck on the reef, and broke to pieces. The 
Islands were helpless to help. It was impossible
to extend an oar. Watchers on that little 
spot of life could only sit and see the game of 
death go on : it was not a snarl and a snap, 
but a slow torture. For the crew had hung and 
clung to the teeth of a rock around which the 
whirlpool played ; and there their distant figures, 
drenched and drowning, pleaded for their 
lives in the sight of the warm-hearted woman 
who could only watch them slip and drop off, 
one by one. 

I think she said they clung there for five 
hours before they surrendered to the sea. 
 

When Mrs. Thaxter had told the story in her 
own inimitable manner, with the vividness of 
vitriol she lifted her eyes, flung them straight 
at mine, with the dreariest look that I ever saw 
on the face of any doubter in the darkest den of 
despair. 

" Fools to cling ! " she cried. " They were 
fools fools to cling ! " 

I have never been one of those fortunate 
people who have their happy thoughts at 
tongue's end ; my repartees are apt to wait for 
my pen ; else I should have answered her : 

" Philosophers to cling ! While there is 
hope of life eternal, the saddest mortal life is 
worth the living. Philosophers to cling ! " 

It is a pleasant thought to me that this gifted 
woman, with the luxurious heart and the eager 
brain, was herself philosopher enough to cling, 
until a distinct measure of spiritual light and 
peace came to her later on. 

She was full of a certain wit, or perhaps 
more exactly, humor, which was native to her 
self, and strong of the salt of her own sea 
weeds. 

One day, I remember, she sat painting china 
which she did after a graceful and original 
fashion when some one present ventured a 
commonplace about the delights of her island 
life : its solitude, its peacefulness, its 
opportunities to study nature, and so on. It was in win 
ter, and it was snowing. She looked out of the 
window into the clashing Boston street, then 
threw back her head, and laughed out long and 
joyously. 

" Did you ever try it ? " she said ; " I've had 
enough of the wilderness. Give me a horse- 
car!" 

Mrs. Thaxter was of attractive personal 
appearance, retaining some suggestion of the 
beauty for which she was distinguished in her 
first youth ; when, betrothed as a mere child, 
and a bride at sixteen, the Miranda of the 
Shoals wedded the first man whom she had 
known, and ventured upon the mainland of life 
at the age when, if she had been a girl of our 
day under the usual conditions, she would have 
been preparing to " come out," or fitting for 
college. 

Like a pale purple aster beside a gorgeous 
golden-rod, the sweet wraith of Lucy Larcom 
flits in beside that of Mrs. Thaxter in my 
memory. 

It falls away again quickly, for I saw Miss 
Larcom but seldom : I knew her chiefly through 
her letters, which reached me at irregular in 
tervals. I had the sincerest respect both for her 
personality and for her work. One of the ex- 
 editors of the " Atlantic Monthly," himself a 
brilliant writer, once reviewed a book of hers in 
these words : 

" There is something in this volume which
