Not a syllable. She simply emptied her purse. " 

Rowland turned over and buried his face in his arms. 
He felt a movement of irrepressible elation, and he barely 
stifled a cry of joy. Now, surely, Roderick had shattered 
the last link in the chain that bound Mary to him, and 
after this she would be free ! . . . When he turned 
about again, Roderick was still sitting there, and he had 
not touched the keys which lay on the grass. 

"I don 't know what is the matter with me," said 



 

Roderick, "but I have an insurmountable aversion to 
taking your money." 

" The matter, I suppose, is that you have a grain of 
wisdom left." 

" No, it 's not that. It 's a kind of brute instinct. I 
find it extremely provoking ! " He sat there for some 
time with his head in his hands and his eyes on the 
ground. His lips were compressed, and he was evidently, 
in fact, in a state of high disgust. " You have succeeded 
in making this thing uncommonly unpleasant !" he ex 
claimed. 

"I am sorry," said Rowland, "but I can't see it in 
any other way." 

" That I believe, and I resent the range of your vision 
pretending to be the limit of my action. You can't feel 
for me or judge for me, and there are certain things you 
know nothing about. I have suffered, sir !" Roderick 
went on, with increasing emphasis and with the ring of 
his fine old Virginian pomposity in his tone. I have 
suffered damnable torments. Have I been such a placid, 
contented, comfortable man this last six months that 
when I find a chance to forget my misery I should take 
such pains not to profit by it ? You ask too much, for a 
man who himself has no occasion to play the hero. I 
don 't say that invidiously ; it 's your disposition, and you 
can't help it. But decidedly there are certain things you 
know nothing about." 

Rowland listened to this outbreak with open eyes, 
and Roderick, if he had been less intent upon his own 
eloquence, would probably have perceived that he turned 
pale. " These things what are they ?" Rowland asked. 

"They are women, principally, and what relates to 
women. Women for you, by what I can make out, 
mean nothing. You have no imagination no sensi 
bility, nothing to be touched !" 

"That 's a serious charge," said Rowland, gravely. 

" I don 't make it without proof!" 



 

"And what is your proof?" 

Roderick hesitated a moment. The way you treated 
Christina Light. I call that grossly obtuse." 

"Obtuse?" Rowland repeated, frowning. 

"Thick-skinned, beneath your good fortune." 

"My good fortune?" 

" There it is it 's all news to you ! You had pleased 
her. I don 't say she was dying of love for you, but she 
took a fancy to you." 

" We will let this pass !" said Rowland, after a silence. 

"Oh, I don 't insist. I have only her own word for 
it." 

" Her own word?" 

"You noticed, at least, I suppose, that she was not 
afraid to speak ! I never repeated it, not because I was 
jealous, but because I was curious to see how long your 
ignorance would last if it were left to itself. " 

" I frankly confess it would have lasted for ever. And 
yet I don 't consider that my insensibility is proved." 

"Oh, don 't say that," cried Roderick, " or I shall 
begin to suspect what I must do you the justice to say 
that I never have suspected that you too have a grain 
of conceit ! Upon my word, when I think of all this, 
your protest, as you call it, against my following Chris 
tina Light seems to me thoroughly offensive. There is 
something monstrous in a man 's pretending to lay down 
the law to a sort of emotion with which he is quite un 
acquainted in his asking a fellow to give up a lovely 
woman for conscience sake when he has never had the 
impulse to strike a blow for one for passion 's !" 

"Oh, oh !" cried Rowland. 

" It 's very easy to exclaim," Roderick went on ; "but 
you must remember that there are such things as nerves 
and senses and imagination and a restless demon within, 
that may sleep sometimes for a day, or for six months, 
but that sooner or later wakes up and thumps at your 
ribs till you listen to him ! If you can't understand it, 



 

take it on trust and let a poor visionary devil live his life 
as he can !" 

Roderick 's words seemed at first to Rowland like 
something heard in a dream ; it was impossible they had 
been actually spoken so supreme an expression were 
they of the insolence of egotism. Reality was never so 
consistent as that ! But Roderick sat there balancing 
his beautiful head, and the echoes of his strident accent 
still lingered along the half-muffled mountain-side. Row 
land suddenly felt that the cup of his chagrin was full to 
overflowing, and his long-gathered bitterness surged into 
the simple wholesome passion of anger for wasted kind 
ness. But he spoke without violence, and Roderick 
was probably at first far from measuring the force that 
lay beneath his words. 

"You are incredibly ungrateful," he said. "You are 
talking arrogant nonsense. What do you know about 
my senses and my imagination ? How do you know 
whether I have loved or suffered ? If I have held my 
tongue and not troubled you with my complaints, you 
find it the most natural thing in the world to put an 
ignoble construction on my silence ! I loved quite as 
well as you ; indeed I think I may say rather better. 
I have been constant. I have been willing to give more 
than I received. I have not forsaken one mistress because 
I thought another more beautiful, nor given up the other 
and believed all manner of evil about her because I had 
not my way with her. I have been a good friend to 
Christina Light, and it seems to me my friendship does 
her quite as much honour as your love ! " 

"Your love your suffering your silence your 
friendship!" cried Roderick. "I declare I don 't 
understand ! " 

"I daresay not. You are not used to understanding
