remembered the sickly-looking man who had sold it, in a little 
shop, far down Broadway; she recollected Rollo's cheery talk to 
the man and some counsel he had given him about his health; 
which counsel, coming from so free a purchaser, who paid cash 
with so ready a hand, stood a fair chance of being followed. Here 
were books, and there were books; here were pictures; there was a 
package of hardware. Well Hazel remembered a little corner shop 
into which her husband had turned to get a dog-chain; and where, 
finding a slim girl keeping shop, and learning that she was doing it 
for her father who was ill, he had gone on to buy a bewildering 
variety of things, which he would not order sent to Chickaree, 
there being perhaps no one in the shop to pack them. Hazel smiled 
as she recollected how Rollo found out that he wanted all sorts of 
things from that little establishment, and how the little girl had 
looked at him and sprung to serve him before he got through.

Byrom was busy unpacking and Hazel examining; the room was in 
a confusion of papers and twines and ropes; when the door opened, 
and there entered upon the scene no less a person than Josephine 
Charteris, n√©e Powder. The lady's look, on taking the effect of 
things, it is impossible to describe. Hazel was gloved in dainty buff 
gauntlets, the folds of her scarlet dress half smothered in the great 
white apron, ruffled and fluted and spotless,and looked 
indescribably busy.

'Josephine Powder!I am not receiving company!' she exclaimed.

'Nonsense! I am glad of it. I want to see you, and I don't want to 
see other people. How you do look, Hazel! Wellhave you really 
gone and got married, and told nobody? Is it true?'

'Telling people is not one of my strong points,' said Hazel. 'Phoebe, 
bring a duster to this chair for Mrs. Charteris.'

'It is one your weak points, I think,' said Josephine. 'Never mind 
the chair. What made you do things in that way?'

Wych Hazel dismissed her attendants, and went back to her foot-
cushion among the packages. 'What makes one do anything?' she 
asked, beginning upon a series of troublesome knots.

'Hm!' said Josephine.'Not being able to help yourself.'

'O is that it?' said Hazel. 'Therehappily for you, I have found 
some sugarplums. Do you buy so many now-a-days that you have 
no taste for more?'

'What on earth are you about?'

'Hard at work on chaos!'

'What sort of chaos?'

'Don't you see?' said Wych Hazel. 'Here are six brackets together, 
for instance, which should be one in a place; and I am puzzled in 
what light to hang these pictures;and these books have no place 
where to be. And if you want needles, Josephine, or a thimbleor 
a sewing-bird, or any little trifle like notepaper or a clotheshamper, 
help yourself!'And her sweet laugh rung out, half for 
nervousness and half for fun.

'How long have you been married?' was the other lady's impetuous 
question.

'Since some time last year,' said Hazel, dragging up another 
package.

'Don't be wicked, Hazel! Were you married at Christmas? Kitty 
Fisher says so, and I didn't believe it. Were you really?'

'I suppose Dr. Maryland does such things "really," when he does 
them at all.'

'Yes!' said Josephine, after a moment's pause and with a half 
groan, 'that's the worst of it. I wish I could know it was a sham. I 
think marriages ought to be broken, if people want them broken. 
The law ought to be so.'

Hazel was silent.

'Don't you think, that when people are tired of each other, they 
ought not to be bound to live together?'

'But you were tired to begin with.'

'No, I wasn't; not so. I thought I could get along with John 
Charteris. He wasn't a beauty, nor a distinguished speaker, but I 
thought I could get along with him. Hazel, I hated him before I had 
been married a week. Men are at your feet till you are tied to them, 
fast; and thenit's very hard, Hazel!the man is the master, and 
he likes it.'

'Is that Mr. Charteris?' said Hazel.

'It is every man!'

'Some flourish their sceptres with a difference,' said Hazel, her lips 
at play. 'Take another bonbon?'

'It's nothing to laugh at!' said the girl bitterly. 'I know you will tell 
me you warned me,but what could I do? They were all at me; 
mamma said I must be married some time; and I thought it didn't 
make much difference; and nowI think I'll run away. Do you 
like your husband?'

'No,' said Hazel with indescribable arch of her brows, which was 
however extremely stately. But as she spoke, the very flush of the 
morningall light and joy and promisestirred and mantled and 
covered her face. It was unmistakeable; words could not have been 
clearer. She bent down over her parcels. And Josephine, watching 
her keenly, saw and read. It was very bitter to her.

'Why,' she said incredulously, though she was not incredulous, 
'you used to hate him a year ago. Do you remember when he 
would not let you ride home with us from the Seatons' one night, 
and how furious you were? Has he changed?'

'As I never remember hating anybody in my life,' said Wych hazel, 
'it is perhaps useless to discuss the question. Do you spend the 
winter here?'

'He had money enough of his own,' Josephine went on,'he had 
no business to marry you. Wellmarriage is a lottery, they say; 
and I have drawn John Charteris. I suppose I must wear him out. If 
I could wear him out!If it was only Jack Charteris!but he is 
the sort of man you couldn't say "Jack" to. Spend the winter here? 
No, I think not. I shall go to Washington by and by. But I don't see 
that it signifies much where one is; life is flat when one can't flirt; 
and John won't let me do that any more, unless I do it on the sly. 
Do you expect to have anything in the world your own way, with 
Dane Rollo?'

Hazel felt herself (privately) getting rather "furious" now. Yet the 
girl at her side stirred her pity, too.

'What sort of man can you say "Jack" to?' she enquired, as if she 
had heard no question.

'You know. A fellow that's anyhow jolly. What are all these things 
here for?'

'If I were you,' said Hazel, 'I would make Mr. Charteris so "jolly" 
(lend me your word for once) that he would be delighted to have 
me say "Jack." '

'I don't want him to be delighted,' said Josephine, 'nor to call him 
Jack. And a man that smokes all the time can't be made jolly. He 
didn't use to let me see it, you know; and now he don't care. He 
ought to live in a house by himself, that's all chimney!'

'Counter attractions would work a cure,' said Wych Hazel, ready to 
laugh at her own suddenly developed wisdom. 'If you make 
yourself disagreeable, Josephine, I should think he would smoke, 
and hide you in a haze.'

'I don't!' said the girl indignantly. 'And nothing on earth will cure a 
man who smokes. He likes it better than anything except money; 
far better than me. Try to get your husband'

Josephine broke suddenly off. The door had opened noiselessly,
