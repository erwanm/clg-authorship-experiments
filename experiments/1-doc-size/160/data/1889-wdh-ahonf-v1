" Ah, how d' ye do, Conrad ? Brought our friend, 
Mr. Beaton, with me," those within heard him say ; 
and then, after a sound of putting off overcoats, they 
saw him fill the doorway, with his feet set square 
and his arms akimbo. 



IX. 



"Ah! hello! hello!" Fulkerson said, in recognition 
of the Marches. " Regular gathering of the clans. 
How are you, Mrs. Dryfoos ? How do you do, Mrs. 
IMandel, Miss Christine, Mela, Aunt Hitty, and all 
the folks ? How you wuz ? " He shook hands 
gaily all round, and took a chair next the old lady, 
whose hand he kept in his own, and left Conrad to 
introduce Beaton. But he would not let the shadow 
of Beaton's solemnity fall upon the company. He 
began to joke with Mrs. Dryfoos, and to match 
rheumatisms with her, and he included all the 
ladies in the range of appropriate pleasantries. 
"I've brought Mr. Beaton along to-night, and I 
want you to make him feel at home, like you do mc, 
Mrs. Dryfoos. He hasn't got any rheumatism to 
speak of ; but his parents live in Syracuse, and he 's 
a kind of an orphan, and we 've just adopted him 
down at the office. "When you going to bring the 
young ladies down there, Mrs. Mandel, for a cham- 
pagne lunch ? I will have some hydro-Mela, and 
Christine it, heigh ? How 's that for a little starter ? 
We dropped in at your place a moment, Mrs. March, 
and gave the young folks a few pointers about their 




studies. My goodness ! it docs me good to sec a 
boy like that of yours ; business, from the word go ; 
and your girl just scoops my youthful affections. 
She 's a beauty, and I guess she 's good too. Well, 
well, what a world it is ! Miss Christine, won't you 
show Mr. Beaton that seal ring of yours ? He 
knows about such things, and I brought him here 
to see it as much as anything. It 's an intaglio I 
brought from the other side," ho explained to Mrs. 
March, '  and I guess you 'll like to look at it. Tried 
to give it to the Dryfoos family, and when I couldn't, 
I sold it to 'em. Bound to see it on Miss Christine's 
hand somehow ! Hold on ! Let him see it where 
it belongs, first ! " 

He arrested the girl in the motion she made to 
take off the ring, and let her have the pleasure of 
showing her hand to the company with the ring on 
it. Tlicu he left her to hear the painter's words 
about it, which he continued to deliver dissyllabically 
as he stood with her under a gas jet, twisting his 
clastic figure and bending his head over the ring. 

"Well, Mely, child," Fulkerson went on, with an 
open travesty of her mother's habitual address, 
" and how are you getting along ? Mrs. Mandel 
hold you up to the proprieties pretty strictly ? Well, 
that 's right. You know you 'd be roaming all over 
the pasture if she didn't." 

The girl gurgled out her pleasure in his funning, 
and everybody took him on his own ground of 
privileged character. He brought them all together 
in their friendliness for himself, and before the 



 

evening was over he had inspired Mrs. Mandel to 
liave them served with coffee, and had made both 
the girls feel that they had figured brilliantly in 
society, and that two young men had been devoted 
to them. 

" Oh, I think he 's just as lovely as he can live ! " 
said Mela, as she stood a moment with her sister 
on the scene of her triumph, where the others had 
left them after the departure of their guests. 

" Who ? " asked Christine deeply. As she 
glanced down at her ring, her eyes burned with a 
softened fire. She had allowed Beaton to change 
it himself from the finger where she had worn it to 
the finger on which he said she ought to wear it. 
She did not know whether it was right to let him, 
but she was glad she had done it. 

" Who ? Mr. Fulkersou, goosie-poosie ! Not 
that old stuck-up Mr. Beaton of yours ! " 

"He is proud," assented Christine, with a throb 
of exultation. 

Beaton and Fulkerson went to the elevated 
station with the Marches ; but the painter said he was 
going to walk home, and Fulkerson let him go alone. 

" One way is enough for me," he explained. 
" When I walk up, I don't walk down, By-by, my 
son ! " He began talking about Beaton to the 
Marches as they climbed the station stairs together. 
" That fellow puzzles me. I don't know anybody 
that I have such a desire to kick, and at the same 
time that I want to flatter up so much. Affect you 
that way ? " he asked of March. 



 

" Well, as far as the kicking goes, yes." 

" And how is it with you??, Mrs. March ? " 

" Oh, I want to flatter him up." 

" No ; really . Why ?â€” Hold on ! I 've got the 
change." 

Fulkerson pushed March away from the ticket- 
office window, and made them his guests, with the 
inexorable American hospitality, for the ride down- 
town. " Three ! " he said to the ticket-seller ; and 
wlien he had walked them before him out on the 
platform and dropped his tickets into the urn, he 
persisted in his inquiry, " Why ? " 

''Why, because you always want to flatter con- 
ceited people, don't you ? " Mrs. March answered, 
with a laugh. 

"Do you? Yes, I guess you do. You think 
Beaton is conceited ? " 

" Well, slightly, Mr. Fulkerson." 

"I guess you're partly right," said Fulkerson, 
with a sigh, so unaccountable in its connection that 
they all laughed. 

"An ideal 'busted' ?" March suggested. 

" No, not that, exactly," said Fulkerson. " But I had 
a notion may be Beaton wasn't conceited all the time." 

"Oh!" Mrs. March exulted, "nobody could be 
so conceited all the time as Mr. Beaton is most of 
the time. He must have moments of the direst 
modesty, when he 'd be quite flattery-proof."
