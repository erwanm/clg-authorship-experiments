" But they could not hear anybody tell them to 
praise." 

"You are a literalist. How can 'the trees of the 
field clap their hands ' ? " 



 

" Does the Bible say they do ? " 

" It says they will. And it says * Let the floods 
clap their hands; let .the hills be joyful together before the Lord ; for he cometh ! ' " 

" But that is very strange too," said Flora. " ' He 
cometh to judge the earth; ' I know the chant; but 
it seems solemn and dreadful, and it is sung in the 
''minor key." 

"I know" said Mr. Murray. "The composer 
did not understand the rejoicing either." 

" But how can any one, Mr. Murray ? " 

"Those 'that love his appearing,' Miss Flora?" 

"I suppose I am very bad, Mr. Murray; but I 
tell you just how I feel. That seems to me the 
most awful of times, and nothing but awful." 

" Perfectly correct, Miss Flora, and just as it is 
described in the Bible. When the kings and the 
great men and the rich men will say to the mountains and to the rocks, ' Fall on us, and hide us ! ' " 

"But you talk of being glad? " said Flora look 
ing a good deal troubled. 

"Ay, but I was thinking of the other party," 
said Mr. Murray gravely, "from whom will go 
up a very different cry, a shout of gladness ' Lo, 
this is our God ! we have waited for him, and he 
will save us.' " 

" Save them from what ? " 

" From all the oppressions and miseries inflicted 
upon them by the rulers of this world; and more, 
from all the evils under which humanity has been 
groaning ever since the fall. Then will strike the 



 

hour of the world's freedom. That will be the time 
when the bridegroom cometh, and they that are 
ready will go in with him to the marriage. Don't 
you think they will be glad ? who have been waiting in darkness and weariness for so long ? Then 
comes the marriage supper, and the everlasting 
union between Christ and his church. Should not 
the church be glad?" 

" You said,  they that are ready. ' ' 

"Yes." 

" Who are they ? " 

" Do you remember the parable of the marriage 
supper ? Don't you recollect, one man had not on 
a wedding garment ? " 

" But what is the wedding garment?" said Flora, 
who looked as if she had some difficulty to keep 
her composure. 

" Shall I answer you in the words of one of old 
time ? ' I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul 
shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me 
with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me 
with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom 
decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride 
adorneth herself with her jewels.' " 

" Then it is something given " said Flora slowly. 

"Given, by the King to the guests; a free gift, 
Miss Flora, to all who accept the King's invitation." 

Flora asked no more, but lay still on her couch 
of pine branches, looking out on the calm and glorified hills. Nobody else broke the silence ; I think 



 

Fenton was gone to sleep; and the others were 
quiet. 

" The shadows are going the wrong way," said 
Flora at last. "I wish this day would last longer! " 

"'A thing of beauty is a joy forever'" said 
Meredith. 

" Don't quote such a dreadfully hackneyed sentiment ! " said his sister. " How comes, it Mr. Mur 
ray, that beautiful things in nature never grow 
hackneyed ? " 

"They are always fresh. No two days in one's 
experience are just like each other." 

"There never was a day in my experience like 
this one," said Flora. " Ditto, aren't you going to 
read some more ? " 

" It will be a variety, if I do." 

"We are made to like variety as Mr. Murray 
has just reminded you." 

Meredith guessed that his sister cared more about 
putting off the hour of departure than about the 
reading in the abstract; and he opened his book 
again, for nobody else made any objection to Flora's 
proposal. 

" I shall read you," said he, " the story of a pastor and a farmer." 

" Those are the people your stories are generally 
about," said Flora. " I hope the variety will lie in 
the treatment. Go on. I don't care what you 
read." 

" In a certain country, that I am not going to 
name, there is a parish village. In the parsonage 



 

lives a pastor; it is not I however. This pastor 
faithfully serves our beloved church with the word 
of God, which he preaches in truth, and with the 
holy sacraments, which he administers as he ought. 
And wherever this is done, the fruit will not be 
wanting; for God has promised it, and he keeps 
his word still, although among men there is little 
truth or faith any longer to be found. 

"'With temporal goods, however, this pastor is 
not specially well provided; and were it not that 
he has a living God in the heavens, he must many 
a time grow anxious and dispirited ; which in truth 
he does not always escape, as he himself humbly 
confesses. For if you have a small benefice, a large 
family, and a couple of children at school to boot, 
sometimes that gives even a believer the headache;
