Early next morning Ellen awoke with a sense that something pleasant had happened. Then the joyful reality darted 
into her mind, and jnmping out of bed she set about her 
morning work with a better heart than she had been able to 
bring to it for many a long day. When she had finished she 
went to the window. She had found out how to keep it 
open now, by means of a big nail stuck in a hole under the 
sash. It was very early, and in the perfect stillness the soft 
gurgle of the little brook came distinctly to her ear. Ellen 
leaned her arms on the window-sill, and tasted the morning 
air ; almost wondering at its sweetness and at the loveliness 
of field and sky and the bright eastern horizon. For days 
and days all had looked dark and sad. 

There were two reasons for the change. In the first place 
Ellen had made up her mind to go straight on in the path of 
duty ; in the second place, she had found a friend. Her 
little heart bounded with delight and swelled with thankfulness at the thought of Alice Humphreys. She was once 
more at peace with herself, and had even some notion of 
being by and by at peace with her aunt; though a sad 
twinge came over her whenever she thought of her mother's 
letter. 

"But there is only one way for me," she thought; "I'll 
do as that dear Miss Humphreys told me — it's good and early, 
and I shall have a fine time before breakfast yet to myself. 







And I'll get up so every morning and have it ! — that'll be 
the very best plan I can hit upon." 

As she thought this she drew forth her Bible from its place 
at the bottom of her trunk ; and opening it at hazard she 
began to read the 18th chapter of Matthew. Some of it she 
did not quite understand ; but she paused with pleasure at 
the 14th verse. "That means me," she thought. The 21st 
and 22nd verses struck her a good deal, but when she came 
to the last she was almost startled. 

" There it is again !" she said. " That is exactly what 
that gentleman said to me. I thought I was forgiven, but 
how can I be, for I feel I have not forgiven aunt Fortune." 

Laying aside her book, Ellen kneeled down ; but this one 
thought so pressed upon her mind that she could think of 
scarce anything else ; and her prayer this morning was an 
urgent and repeated petition that she might be enabled " from 
her heart " to forgive her aunt Fortune ** all her trespasses." 
Poor Ellen ! she felt it was very hard work. At the very 
minute she was striving to feel at peace with her aunt, one 
grievance after another would start up to remembrance, and 
she knew the feelings that met them were far enough from 
the spirit of forgiveness. In the midst of this she was called 
down. She rose with tears in her eyes, and " what shall I 
do?" in her heart. Bowing her head once more she earnestly prayed that if she could not yet feel right towards her 
aunt, she might be kept at least from acting or speaking 
wrong. Poor Ellen ! In the heart is the spring of action ; 
and she found it so this morning. 

Her aunt and Mr. Van Brunt were already at the table. 
Ellen took her place in silence, for one look at her aunt's 
face told her that no " good morning " would be accepted. 
Miss Fortune was in a particularly bad humour, owing among 
other things to Mr. Van Brunt's having refused to eat his 
breakfast unless Ellen were called. An unlucky piece of 
kindness. She neither spoke to Ellen nor looked at her ; Mr. 
Van Brunt did what in him lay to make amends. He helped 
her very carefully to the cold pork and potatoes, and handed 
her the well-piled platter of griddle-cakes. 

" Here's the first buckwheats of the season," said he, — 
" and I told Miss Fortune I warn't a going to eat one on 'em 
if you didn't come down to enjoy 'em along with us. 





Take two — take two ! — you want 'em to keep each other 
hot." 

Ellen's look and smile thanked him, as following his advice 
she covered one generous " buckwheat " with another as 
ample. 

" That's the thing ! Now here's some prime Maple. You 
like 'em I guess, don't you?" 

" I don't know yet — I have never seen any," said Ellen. 

" Never seen buckwheats ! why they're 'most as good as 
my mother's splitters. Buckwheat cakes and maple molasses, 
— that's food fit for a king, I think — when they're good ; 
and Miss Fortune's is always first-rate." 

Miss Fortune did not relent at all at this compliment. 

" What makes you so white this morning ?" Mr. Van 
Brunt presently went on ; — " you aint well, be you ?" 

" Yes," — said Ellen doubtfully, — I'm well — 

" She's as well as I am, Mr. Van Brunt, if you don't go 
and put her up to any notions !" Miss Fortune said in a kind 
of choked voice. 

Mr. Van Brunt hemmed, and said no more to the end of 
breakfast-time. 

Ellen rather dreaded what was to come next, for her aunt's 
look was ominous. In dead silence the things were put 
away, and put up, and in course of washing and drying, 
when Miss Fortune suddenly broke forth. 

" What did you do with yourself yesterday afternoon?" 

" I was up on the mountain," said Ellen. 

" What mountain ?" 

" I believe they call it the * Nose.' " 

" What business had you up there ?" 

" I hadn't any business there." 

" What did you go there for?'' 

" Nothing." 

" Nothing ! — you expect me to believe that ? you call 
yourself a truth-teller, I suppose ?" 

" Mamma used to say I was," said poor Ellen, striving to 
swallow her feelings. 

" Your mother ! — I dare say — mothers always are blind. 
I dare say she took everything you said for gospel !" 

Ellen was silent, from sheer want of words that were pointed 
enough to suit her. 







" I wish Morgan could have had the gumption to marry 
in his own country ; but he must go running after a Scotch- 
woman ! A Yankee would have brought up his child to be 
worth something. Give me Yankees ! 

Ellen set down the cup she was wiping. 

" You don't know anything about my mother," she said.
