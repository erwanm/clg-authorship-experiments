"I was only joking about it. They'll miss 
her in the s'ciety that's what they will." 

Aunt Letty Perkins was dreadful! a thorn 
in the flesh ; a sort of bitter, puckery presence, 
as if you had just tasted an unripe persimmon. 

"And it'll be a puzzle to get husbands for 
'em all. That's the most unfort'net thing about 
girls." 

I suppose she meant ws, not the society. My 
face was in a blaze of indignation. Then the 
door was shut, and I went on with my dusting. 

It was a sunny April morning, and a pair of 
 
swallows were ^tmttejingV^l/out! ie windows. 
Another sirl and heye-wra -seven of us. Some 

one in the parish c !*aid*' eater that Mrs. Endicott 

would always feel  ! uiiday school class, 
for she could fill it up with her own children. 
I couldn't help wishing that there was just one 
boy among us, even if it were that wee bairnie 
they had been discussing. Boys are nice in 
some ways. 


I don't know that I should have modified my 
opinion so suddenly but for two things. My eye 
happened to fall on my pretty pearl paper- 
cutter, that had been sent to me at Christmas. 
On one side of the handle was my monogram, 
done in scarlet and gold, on the other a little 
trail of blue forget-me-nots. A few weeks ago 
Harry Denliam had been in spending the eve- 
ning with us,- -that means Fan and I, the elders. 
He and Fanny were having a little scrimmage, 
and, in a half tragic manner, he seized my pretty 
gift, pretending to arm himself with a dagger, 
and, somehow, in the melee, the poor thing 
snapped in twain. 

Hal was very sorry. Then he had such great, 
beseeching brown eyes, that when he turned them 
so appealingly to me, I pitied him more than I 
did myself. It was very foolish, I know". I 
ought to have scolded. I should have said, 

You great, rough, careless boy! now see 
what you have done ! I wish you would never 
come here again ! ' 

"I can get it mended, I know. There is 
some beautiful white cement used for such ar- 
ticles. O, Rose, I am so sorry ! I'd get you 
another one, only it wouldn't be it."' 



"Never mind," I said, meekly, with a wonderful 
tendency towards tears, though whether 
they would have been for Harry, or the knife, 
or myself, I could not exactly tell. 

So he had it mended, and it looked as good 
as new. But little Frank Mortimer came to call 
with his mother, and brought it to grief again. 

The other event that reconciled me to the 
advent of my little sister, whom I had not yet 
seen, was Tabby, who sprang up on the window 
sill, with her cunning salutation, like three or 
four n's, strung together in a prolonged musical 
fashion, not quite a mew. I don't want you to 
think the word back there was meant for a pun, 



for it wasn't. I'll tell you in the beginning that 
I am not a bit bright, or sharp, or funny. I 
have even heard jokes that I did not see the 
point of until the next day. 

Tabby is just as beautiful as she can be. A 
Maltese cat, with a white nose and two white 
front paws. She is very cunning, and knows 
almost everything within the domain of cat 
knowledge. If there is one thing I do love bet 
ter than another, in the way of pets, it is cats

household a feeling of contentment. Then the 
kittens are always so funny and frolicksome ! 

" Tabby," I said, as she arched her back and 
rubbed her head against my sleeve, "Tabby, 
you wouldn't be half so happy if there was a 
boy in the house. He would lift you by the 
tail, turn your ears back, put walnut shells on 
your feet, and make you dance on your hind 
legs. Then he would be forever tormenting 
}'our kittens. Boys are bad naturally. Maybe 
they are born so, and can't help it," I con- 
tinued, reflectively. "I suppose they do have a 
good deal more of the old Adam in them than 
girls, because, you see, we inherit Eve's pro- 
pensity to curiosity; but then boys are fully as 
curious aren't they, Tabby? and as full of 
curiosity ! ' 

"Yes," answered Tabby. 

She says it as plainly as you do. In fact, we 
sometimes hold quite lengthy conversations. 

"So we don't care do we? If Aunt Letty 
Perkins would not make such a row about it! 
How would she like to have a lot of boys, I 
wonder ? ' 

Tabby shook her head sagely, and scratched 
her left ear. I knew she felt just the same at 
I did. 

I finished the parlor, and shut down the win- 
dows. Then I went to papa's study, took the 
ashes softly out of the grate, and laid another 
fire, in case the evening should be cool, picked 
up papers and magazines, and dusted with the 
very lightest of touches. It was my part of the 
work to look after the study. I was so glad to 
be able to suit papa ! 

Just then the door opened. It was papa him- 
self, fresh from a walk. / think him ever and 
ever so handsome, though sometimes I wish he 

was not quite so thin. He is rather tall, has a 
fine chest and shoulders ; but it is his sweet, 
dear old face that I like so much. It's a little 
wrinkled, to be sure, and may be his mouth is a 
trifle wide. I never considered it any defect, 
however, for he shuts his lips together with such 
a cordial smile ! He has lovely deep-gray eyes, 
and his hair, which was once a bright brown, 
begins to be toned with silvery threads, as well 
as his soft brown beard, which he wears full, 
except a mustache. 

" O, papa ! ' I cried, clasping my arms around 
his neck, "are you very sorry?' 

" Sorry for what, my daughter ? ' And he 
looked a good deal surprised.
