future. 

"I never thought I should want to stay here 
so much," he said. "I was glad enough to get 
away last summer. I cannot forgive myself for 
being such a boor ! Now I shall want to come 
again and again." 

"Well why not?" I returned. 
"I am afraid you will become tired of me." 
" Try us and see. We are not easily wearied.'' 
"You are all so generous with yourselves." 
I smiled a little. "Why not jnve of your 


best?" 

" True." Then there was a silence. We 
reached the gate presently. " Do not go in just 
yet ; ' he pleaded, so we remained in the silvery 
light that was flooding the whole earth. Moon- 
light always stirs the tender and thoughtful side- 
. of one's soul. 

" I am glad that to-morrow will be Sunday. I 
can just think how I shall enjoy going to church 
and hearing your father preach." 

This from him who had despised religion and 
sneered at sermons. It did startle me. 

" And to have Stephen here." 

I am rejoiced that you feel so kindly toward 
one another," I replied. " You are getting to be 
brothers indeed." 

" And then will come weeks and weeks of 
study," he went on in a musing tone. " I like 
it. Books seem to me well, better than some 
people. Only if you could all come down in 
the winter. Stephen and Mrs. Whitcomb were 
planning for it, but there ! it was a secret and 
I have betrayed it." 

"I can keep secrets;' and I smiled up into 
his remorseful face. 

 

"Yes; I have proved that. Rose" after a 
pause- -"I have half a mind to tell you another, 
to ask some - - advice ; at least, I would like to 
know how it appears to you." 

" Will it be of any real avail ? ' I asked, 
noting the perplexed lines on his countenance. 
" I am not as wise as you think. Because I 
just happened to stumble into one matter with- 
out making a mess of it 

" This is only an idea. I cannot ask Stephen. 
I think it would please him and he might judge 
wrongfully." 

" If I can help you ; ' I replied encouragingly. 

"It is about the future. It may never come 
to anything to be sure, and perhaps I never can 
be good enough. Stuart will go into business. 
He does not love study and he needs an active 
life. He wanted Stephen to put him in a store 
this Autumn. But I- 

I knew then what he meant. Somehow I 
could not help laying my hand on his arm with 
a touch of confidence. 

" Whether I ever could so govern my temper 
and my impatient desires ; ' bowing his head 
humbly. " But if I had some guard about me, 
if I felt that I must try continually would it 
be wrong to think of it ? ' 



 

" Surely not ; ' I returned warmly. " Nor to 
do it if God gives the strength and the grace.'
" I like to think of that grand, earnest Saint 
Paul, with his 4 thorn in the flesh.' Perhaps it 
was some giant temper or desire. I fancy it 
must have been, for you know how he persecuted 
the Christians unto de,ath. And though God 
would not take it away, there was the promise 
of His grace being sufficient." 

" As it is, always." 

" There are some years to live before I decide 
positively. But if they were spent in a worthy 
manner, and I mean them to be, with God's 
help." 

" Oh, you could, surely. And papa would be 
your best friend ; ' I rejoined eagerly. 

"Keep my secret I have your promise," he 
said in a hurried manner, for a step sounded on 
the walk. 

"It is sacred to me until you wish to take 
others into your confidence." 

Stephen spoke and we turned, walking slowly 
up to the house. Louis sat down on the step 
beside papa. I stood undecided whether to be
in or not, \vlien Stephen took my arm and divw 
me around the corner of the porch. There was 



 

a long grape arbor whose gloom was made a 
pleasant twilight by the silver sifted through 
the openings between the leaves, and we took a 
turn up and down. 

" I want to tell you," he began almost abruptly, 
and his voice had a hard, strained sound, "that 
I heard- -the last of what you said. I could 
not help it. And I know your secret." 

I was a trifle annoyed, but I controlled my- 
self. 

"Oh," I said, "then you will be tender and 
helpful and do all in your power to strengthen 
Louis. He feels so humble. I would hardly have 
thought it of him. And there are so few young 
men who have any desire to take such a life 
upon them. With his means and his talents he 
can do so much good." 

He stopped suddenly. " Rose, what are you 
talking about?" he asked. "Did not Louis " 

"He confessed to me his desire- -110, it was 
hardly that, as he is afraid he can never be good 
enough for a clergyman. But you will assist 
hun you do not disapprove of it? ! 

" Louis ! Ah, I understand. It would be the 
delight of my heart. But I thought- -I knew 
he liked you so much. Oh, my little darling ! '
