regated from each other and be separate individuals, 
like other men. But of course as soon as his mind 
cleared and these diseased imaginings passed away, 
he shuddered at the repulsive thought, and earnest- 
ly prayed that it might visit him no more. To be 
separate, and as other men are! How awkward it 
would seem; how unendurable. What would he 
do with his hands, his arms? How would his legs 
feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every 
action, attitude, movement, gesture would be. To 
sleep by himself, eat by himself, walk by himself — 
how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any 





 

fate but that. In every way and from every point, 
the idea was revolting. 

This was of course natural; to have felt other- 
wise would have been unnatural. He had known 
no life but a combined one; he had been familiar 
with it from his birth; he was not able to conceive 
of any other as being agreeable, or even bearable. 
To him, in the privacy of his secret thoughts, all 
other men were monsters, deformities: and during 
three-fourths of his life their aspect had rilled him 
with what promised to be an unconquerable aver- 
sion. But at eighteen his eye began to take note of 
female beauty; and little by little, undefined long- 
ings grew up in his heart, under whose softening 
influences the old stubborn aversion gradually di- 
minished, and finally disappeared. Men were still 
monstrosities to him, still deformities, and in his 
sober moments he had no desire to be like them, but 
their strange and unsocial and uncanny construction 
was no longer offensive to him. 

This had been a hard day for him, physically and 
mentally. He had been called in the morning be- 
fore he had quite slept off the effects of the liquor 
which Luigi had drunk; and so, for the first half- 
hour had had the seedy feeling, and languor, the 
brooding depression, the cobwebby mouth and 
druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill 
a preparation for bodily or intellectual activities; 
the long violent strain of the reception had followed ; 
and this had been followed, in turn, by the dreary 
sight-seeing, the Judge's wearying explanations and 
laudations of the sights, and the stupefying clamor 





 

of the dogs. As a congruous conclusion, a fitting 
end, his feelings had been hurt, a slight had been 
put upon him. He would have been glad to forego 
dinner and betake himself to rest and sleep, but he 
held his peace and said no word, for he knew his 
brother, Luigi, was fresh, unweary, full of life, spirit, 
energy; he would have scoffed at the idea of wast- 
ing valuable time on a bed or a sofa, and would have 
refused permission. 



CHAPTER IV 

SUPERNATURAL CHRONOMETRY 

ROWENA was dining out, Joe and Harry were 
belated at play, there were but three chairs 
and four persons that noon at the home dinner- 
table — the twins, the widow, and her chum, Aunt 
Betsy Hale. The widow soon perceived that An- 
gelo's spirits were as low as Luigi's were high, and 
also that he had a jaded look. Her motherly solici- 
tude was aroused, and she tried to get him interested 
in the talk and win him to a happier frame of mind, 
but the cloud of sadness remained on his counte- 
nance. Luigi lent his help, too. He used a form and 
a phrase which he was always accustomed to employ 
in these circumstances. He gave his brother an affec- 
tionate slap on the shoulder and said, encouragingly : 

"Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!" 

But this did no good. It never did. If anything, 
it made the matter worse, as a rule, because it 
irritated Angelo. This made it a favorite with 
Luigi. By and by the widow said: 

"Angelo, you are tired, you've overdone your- 
self; you go right to bed after dinner, and get a 
good nap and a rest, then you'll be all right." 

"Indeed, I would give anything if I could do 
that, madam." 

"And what's to hender, I'd like to know? Land, 





 

the room's yours to do what you please with! The 
idea that you can't do what you like with your 
own!" 

"But, you see, there's one prime essential — 
an essential of the very first importance — which 
isn't my own." 

"What is that?" 

"My body." 

The old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt Betsy 
Hale said: 

"Why bless your heart, how is that?" 

"It's my brother's." 

"Your brother's! I don't quite understand. I 
supposed it belonged to both of you." 

"So it does. But not to both at the same time." 

"That is mighty curious; I don't see how it can 
be. I shouldn't think it could be managed that 
way." 

"Oh, it's a good enough arrangement, and goes 
very well; in fact, it wouldn't do to have it other- 
wise. I find that the teetotalers and the anti- 
teetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their 
meetings. Both parties don't use it at the same 
time, do they?" 

"You bet they don't!" said both old ladies in a 
breath. 

"And, moreover," said Aunt Betsy, "the Free- 
thinkers and the Baptist Bible class use the same 
room over the Market house, but you can take my 
word for it they don't mush up together and use it 
at the same time." 

"Very well," said Angelo, "you understand it
