He was asleep there on the bed when Richard 
came home to dinner and looked softly in. He 
decided not to wake him, and Mary said the sleep 
would do him more good than the dinner. At table 



 

they talked him over, and she told her husband what 
she knew of the morning 's adventure. 

"That was pretty tough for father," said Rich- 
ard. " I wouldn 't go into the house with him, be 
cause I knew he wanted to have it to himself; and 
then to think of that dirty hound skulking in! 
Well, perhaps it 's for the best. It will make it 
easier for father to go and leave the place, and 
they ve got to go. They ve got to put the Atlantic 
Ocean between Ellen and that fellow." 

" It does seem as if something might be done," 
his wife rebelled. 

" They ve done the best that could be done," said 
Richard. " And if that skunk hasn 't got some sort 
of new hold upon father, I shall be satisfied. The 
worst of it is that it will be all over town in an 
hour that Bittridge has made up with us. I don 't 
blame father; he couldn 't help it; he never could 
be rude to anybody." 

" I think I 'll try if I can 't be rude to Mr. Bit 
tridge, if he ever undertakes to show in my presence 
that he has made it up with us" said Mary. 

Richard tenderly found out from his father 's 
shamefaced reluctance, later, that no great mischief 
had been done. But no precaution on his part avail 
ed to keep Bittridge from demonstrating the good 
feeling between himself and the Kentons when the 
judge started for New York the next afternoon. 
He was there waiting to see him off, and he all 
but took the adieux out of Richard 's hands. He 
got possession of the judge 's valise, and pressed past 



 

the porter into the sleeping-car with it, and remain 
ed lounging on the arm of the judge 's seat, making 
conversation with him and Richard till the train 
began to move. Then he ran outside, and waved 
his hand to the judge 's window in farewell, before 
all that leisure of Tuskingum which haunted the 
arrival and departure of the trains. 

Mary Kenton was furious when her husband came 
home and reported the fact to her. 

" How in the world did he find out when father 
was going?" 

"He must have come to all the through trains 
since he say him yesterday. But I think even you 
would have been suited, Mary, if you had seen his 
failure to walk off from the depot arm-in-arm with 
me." 

" I wouldn 't have been suited with anything short 
of your knocking him down, Dick." 

" Oh, that wouldn 't have done," said Richard. 
After a while he added, patiently, " Ellen is making 
a good deal of trouble for us." 

That was what Mary was thinking herself, and 
it was what she might have said, but since Dick 
had said it she was obliged to protest. " She isn 't 
to blame for it." 

" Oh, I know she isn 't to blame." 



The father of the unhappy girl was of the same 
mixed mind as he rode sleeplessly back to New York 
in his berth, and heard the noises of slumber all 
round him. From time to time he groaned softly, and 
turned from one cheek to the other. Every half- 
hour or so he let his window-curtain fly up, and 
lay watching the landscape fleeting past; and then 
he pulled the curtain down again and tried to 
sleep. After passing Albany he dozed, but at Pough- 
keepsie a zealous porter called him by mistake, and 
the rest of the way to New York he sat up in the 
smoking-room. It seemed a long while since he had 
drowsed; the thin nap had not rested him, and the 
old face that showed itself in the glass, with the 
frost of a two days beard on it, was dry-eyed and 
limply squared by the fall of the muscles at the 
corners of the chin. 

He wondered how he should justify to his wife 
the thing which he felt as accountable for having 
happened to him as if he could have prevented it. 
It would not have happened, of course, if he had 
not gone to Tuskingum, and she could say that to 
him; now it seemed to him that his going, which 
had been so imperative before he went, was al- 



 

together needless. Nothing but harm had come of 
it, and it had been a selfish indulgence of a culpable 
weakness. 

It was a little better for Kenton when he found 
himself with his family, and they went down to 
gether to the breakfast which the mother had en 
gaged the younger children to make as pleasant 
as they could for their father, and not worry 
him with talk about Tuskingum. They had, in fact, 
got over their first season of homesickness, and were 
postponing their longing for Tuskingum till their 
return from Europe, when they would all go straight 
out there. Kenton ran the gantlet of welcome 
from the black elevator-boys and bell-boys and the 
head-waiter, who went before him to pull out the 
judge 's chair, with commanding frowns to his un 
derlings to do the like for the rest of the family; 
and as his own clumsy Irish waiter stood behind 
his chair, breathing heavily upon the judge 's head, 
he gave his order for breakfast, with a curious 
sense of having got home again from some strange 
place. He satisfied Boyne that his pigeons and 
poultry had been well cared for through the winter, 
and he told Lottie that he had not met much of 
anybody except Dick 's family, before he recollected 
seeing half a dozen of her young men at different 
times. She was not very exacting about them, and 
her mind seemed set upon Europe, or at least she 
talked of nothing else. Ellen was quiet as she al 
ways was, but she smiled gently on her father, and 
Mrs. Kenton told him of the girl 's preparations for 



 

going, and congratulated herself on their wisdom 
in having postponed their sailing, in view of all 
they had to do; and she made Kenton feel that 
everything was in the best possible shape. As soon 
as she got him alone in their own room, she said, 
" Well, what is it, poppa?"
