sister of mine would be allowed to do such a thing. 



She can't love him ! Why, she has only been 
driving out with him a few times." 

" If she 's sold, she has done the business herself. 
She 's a girl to look out for the main chance. 
Weir, I hope you haven't been hovering too near 
the flame. The Ludlow is capital to flirt with, 
quick, spicy, sentimental by spells, not the kind 
of a girl to waste herself on a young, impecunious 
fellow like our friend Jim, here, so he goes scot- 
free. Weir, I hope you 're not hard hit. We 've 
all had a good time ; but I think now we must 
address ourselves to the examinations in hand, 
and let the girls go. Though I am in for two 
big weddings, presently." 

There was a summons to the class-room that 
stopped the chaffing. Jim felt very sober. Lily 
had indirectly led him to think she cared a great 
deal about him, and if matters only were a little 
different ! He ought not to get engaged ; but the 
preference was flattering when a man like Weir 
was head over heels in love with her ! 

But to marry an old man like Gerald William- 
son ! thought the young fellow, disdainfully. 



 



CHAPTER XVI 

COUNTING UP THE COST 

JlM failed miserably. What was the matter? 
He couldn't seem to remember the simplest 
thing. Did it make any difference to him whom 
she married ? Well - - if it had been Weir ; but that 
imperious, pretentious, half-dissipated Williamson, 
who report said had run though with one fortune, 
and two years ago had fallen heir to another ! Why 
were some people so lucky ! Grandmother Van 
Kortlandt had some money ; but Hanny was named 
for her, and Joe was a great favourite. Then Jim 
flushed hotly. The idea of counting on any one's 
money ! 

Still he had a boyish, chivalric idea that he would 
like to snatch Lily from this awful peril, as it seemed 
to him. Could it be really true? The older men 
said Williamson was a braggart. There might be 
no truth in it. He would ask Lily. 

Several days passed before Jim achieved his 
desire. Then, as he loitered around one afternoon, 
he saw Williamson leave the house. After a few 
moments he knocked. 

" Miss Lily is indisposed, and cannot see any 
one," announced the maid. 



"She will see me," returned Jim, with an air of 
dignity; and he walked into the parlour that had 
an atmosphere of twilight, quite determined to 
remain until she came down. 

She seemed in no hurry, and Jim's temper began 
to loose its serenity. The maid came and lighted 
the gas jet in the hall. Then there was a rustle 
of silken garments on the stair. 

" Oh, Jim dear," the entreating voice said, 
" I 've had such a horrid headache all the after- 
noon. I 've been in the bed. I really did not 
feel fit to see any one," with a languid, indifferent 
air. 

And Williamson had just gone away ! 

" So you will excuse me, if I 'm stupid - 

"Is the story true about your- -your engage- 
ment? ' asked the young fellow, abruptly. 

" My engagement? Well, I've had an offer of 
marriage, - - two of them. Wouldn't you advise 
me to take the best one?' rather archly. 

The tone rang flippantly. Jim felt she was 
evading. 

" You see I can't be young always. And Aunt 
Nicoll may go without a moment's warning. She 
had a bad spell yesterday ; and she does get in such 
horrid tantrums ! Mother is awfully tired of stay- 
ing with her. And most girls get married - - those 
who have a chance." She ended with a forced 
little laugh. 

"Is it Williamson? You don't know the sort 
of man he is," and Jim's voice was husky with 
emotion. 

 

" Oh, everybody gets talked about sooner or 
later ! He has been rather wild ; but he wants to 
settle down now. And I 'm not a sentimental girl. 
Yes, I do think I 'll take him," hesitatingly. 

"Lily!" 

" Oh, Jim, you are very young and inexperienced ! 
If you were ten years older, there wouldn't be a 
man on the whole earth I 'd marry as soon. But 
you know I said we could only be friends ; and 
I hope you haven't been cherishing any silly 
romances about me," tossing her head coquettishly. 
" I shall always like you, and I want us to keep 
friends. But you can't understand all the reasons. 
Some girls might drag you into an engagement, 
and waste all your young years ; but I could not 
be so mean to any friend I cared about. We have 
settled all this matter." 

Her tone took on a rather sharp business accent. 
It was almost curt. 

Yes, it had been settled. Yet she had de- 
manded a lover-like devotion, and allowed him to 
speculate on what might have been if she were 
rich or he older. And though Jim's sturdy com- 
mon-sense had kept him from going very deep, 
he felt wretched and jealous that any other man 
should have the supreme right ; and yet he had a 
conviction that the friendship or flirtation ought 
to end. 

"He thinks you are Mrs. Nicoll's heiress." 

She gave a light laugh. "Oh, that will do to 
talk about ; and she may leave me a little. If I 
was her heiress ' 



The glance roused Jim's anger. He rose 
suddenly. 

" I hope you love Williamson," he said, in 
a tone that he meant to sound bitterly cutting.
