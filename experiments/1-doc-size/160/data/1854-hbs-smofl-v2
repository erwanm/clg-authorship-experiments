black as my shoe, and a disgusting, dry thing, nevertheless 
the little head was covered with fine, soft, auburn hair. Four 
thousand years ago, some mother thought the poor little thing 
a beauty. Also I saw mummies of cats, crocodiles, the ibis, 
and all the other religious bijouterie of Egypt, with many cases 
of their domestic utensils, ornaments, &c. 

The whole view impressed me with quite an idea of bar- 
barism ; much more so than the Assyrian collection. About 
the winged bulls there is a solemn and imposing grandeur; 
they have a mountainous and majestic nature. These Egyp- 
tian things give one an idea of inexpressible ungainliness. 
They had a clumsy, elephantine character of mind, these 
Egyptians. There was not wanting grace, but they seemed 
to pick it up accidentally ; because among all possible forms 
some must be graceful. They had a kind of grand, mammoth 
civilization, gloomy and goblin. They seem to have floun- 
dered up out of Nile mud, like that old, slimy, pre-Adamite 
brood, the what's-their-name — megalosaurus, ichthyosaurus, 
pterodactyle, iguanodon, and other misshapen abominations, 
with now and then wreaths of lotus and water lilies round 
their tusks. 

The human face, as represented in Assyrian sculptures, is 
a higher type of face than even the Greek : it is noble and 
princely ; the Egyptian faces are broad, flat, and clumsy. If 
Egypt gave birth to Greece, with her beautiful arts, then truly 
this immense, clumsy roc's egg hatched a miraculous nest of 
loves and graces. 





Among the antiques here, my two favorites are Venus de 
Milon, which I have described to you, and the Diane Chas- 
seresse : this goddess is represented by the side of a stag ; 
and so completely is the marble made alive, that one seems to 
perceive that a tread so airy would not bend a flower. Every 
side of the statue is almost equally graceful. The small, 
proud head is thrown back with the freedom of a stag ; there 
is a gay, haughty self-reliance, an airy defiance, a rejoicing 
fulness of health and immortal youth in the whole figure. 
You see before you the whole Greek conception of an immor- 
tal — a creature full of intellect, full of the sparkle and elixir 
of existence, in whom the principle of life seems to be crystal- 
lized and concentrated with a dazzling abundance ; light, airy, 
incapable alike of love and of sympathy ; living for self, and self 
only. Alas for poor souls, who, in the heavy anguish of life, 
had only such goddesses to go to ! How far in advance is 
even the idolatry of Christianity ! how different the idea of 
Mary from the Diana ! 

Yet, as I walked up and down among these remains of 
Greek art, I could not but wonder at the spectacle of their 
civilization : no modern development reproduces it, nor ever 
can or will. It is well to cherish and make much of that 
ethereal past, as a specimen of one phase of humanity, for it 
is past forever. Those isles of Greece, with their gold and 
purple haze of light and shadow, their exquisite, half-spiritual, half-bodily formation — islands where flesh and blood 
became semi-spiritual, and where the sense of beauty was an 
existence — have passed as a vision of glory, never to return. 
One scarcely realizes how full of poetry was their mythology ; 
all successive ages have drawn on it for images of beauty 
without exhausting it ; and painters and artists, to this day, 




are fettered and repressed by vain efforts to reproduce it. 
But as a religion for the soul and the heart, all this is vain and 
void ; all powerless to give repose or comfort. One who should 
seek repose on the bosom of such a mythology is as one who 
seeks to pillow himself on the many-tinted clouds of evening ; 
soft and beautiful as they are, there is nothing real to them but 
their dampness and coldness. 

Here M. and Madame Belloc entered, and as he wanted 
my opinion of the Diane, I let her read this part of the letter 
to him in French. You ought to have seen M. Belloc, with 
tears in his eyes, defending the old Greeks, and expounding 
to me, with all manner of rainbow illustrations, the religious 
meanings of Greek mythology, and the morale of Greek 
tragedy. Such a whole souled devotion to a nation dead 
and gone could never be found but in France. 

Madame Belloc was the translator of Maria Edgeworth by 
that lady's desire ; corresponded with her for years, and still 
has many of her letters. Her translation of Uncle Tom has 
to me all the merit and all the interest of an original composition. In perusing it I enjoy the pleasure of reading the story 
with scarce any consciousness of its ever having been mine. 
In the evening Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall called. They are 
admirably matched — he artist, she author. The one writes 
stories, the other illustrates them. Madame M. also called. 
English by birth, she is a true Parisienne, or, rather, seems to 
have both minds, as she speaks both languages, perfectly. Her 
husband being a learned Oriental scholar, she, like some other 
women enjoying similar privileges, has picked up a deal 
of information, which she tosses about in conversation, 
in a gay, piquant manner, much as a kitten plays with a pin 
ball. 







Madame remembers Mesdames Recamier and De Stael, 
and told me several funny anecdotes of the former. Madame 
R., she said, was always coquetting with her own funeral ; con- 
versed with different artists on the arrangements of its details, 
and tempting now one, now another, with the brilliant hope of 
the " composition " of the scene. Madame M. offered me her 
services as cicerone to Paris, and so to-day out we went — 
first to the Pantheon, of which, in her gay and piquant style, 
she gave me the history. 

Begun first in the time of Louis XVI. as a church, in the 
revolution its destination was altered, and it was to be a tem- 
ple to the manes of great men, and accordingly Rousseau, Vol- 
taire, and many more are buried here. Well, after the revo- 
lution, the Bourbons said it should not be a temple for great 
men, it should be a church. The next popular upset tipped it 
back to the great men again ; and it staid under their jurisdiction until Louis Napoleon, who is very pious, restored it to 
the church. It is not possible to say how much further this 
very characteristic rivalry between great men and their Creator is going to extend. All I have to say is, that I should 
not think the church much of an acquisition to either party, 
lie that sitteth in the heavens must laugh sometimes at what 
man calls worship. This Pantheon is, as one might suppose 
from its history, a hybrid between a church and a theatre, and 
of course good for neither — purposeless and aimless. The 
Madeleine is another of these hybrid churches, begun by 
D'lvry as a church, completed as a temple to victory by Napoleon, and on second thoughts, re-dedicated to God. 

After strolling about a while, the sexton, or some official of 
the church, asked us if we did not want to go down into the 
vaults below. As a large party seemed to be going to do 







the same, I said, " O, yes, by all means ; let us see it out." 
Our guide, with his cocked hat and lantern, -walked ahead, 
apparently in a flow of excellent spirits. These caverns 
and tombs appeared to be his particular Ibrte, and he mag- 
nified his office in showing them. Down stairs we went, 
none of us knowing what we wanted to see, or why. Our 
guide steps forth, unlocks the gates of Hades, and were enter a 
dark vault with a particularly earthy smell. Bang ! he 
shuts the door after him. Clash ! he locks it ; now we are in 
for it! and elevating his lantern, he commences a deafening 
proclamation of some general fact concerning the very unsa- 
vory place in which we find ourselves. Of said proclamation 
I hear only the thundering " Voila " at the commencement. 
Kext he proceeds to open the doors of certain stone vaulted 
chambers, where the great men are buried, between whose
