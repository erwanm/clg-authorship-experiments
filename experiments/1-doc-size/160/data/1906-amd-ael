Easter she could make it bloom. It would be 
a good study of care and conditions. 

The other was an experiment in self-culture 
that called a flush to some of the faces. 

‘‘Girls,” Mrs. Trevor said smilingly, “I know 
you have often made me an Easter gift. I am 
going to make my own choice this time. I 
want every girl to write down her besetting 
sin or worst fault, and then set against it every 
time she has conquered it. Some of you are 
untidy, some indolent, a great many forgetful 
and careless, others given to exaggeration. 
Then if you will, hand them to me on Easter 

 


Even. You know the old Jews had a scape- 
goat they sent out in the wilderness bearing 
the burthen of their sins.” 

‘‘O, but Mrs. Trevor, that would be making 
you a sort of scapegoat,” said one girl with a 
very red face. 



“No, we will put them all in the fire; that 
will be the scapegoat. And I shall be proud of 
every time a girl has conquered any bad habit. 
It will benefit you, and I shall feel that you 
were willing to make the effort for my sake.” 

 


It was a novel endeavor. The girls really 
did try. You could see the difference in the 
school. 

May Anderson was Alice’s room-mate. In 
the large rooms with two windows there were 
two beds. May was very careless. She slung 
things about ; no other word expresses it. 
Alice was neat and orderly for a little girl. 

'It seems a funny gift,” said Edith Mains, 
‘to hand over your faults — oh, if we could get 
rid of them that way.” 

“It is for the effort and discipline,” explained 
another. “I ’ve had some difficulty in telling 
things just as they happened, and I ’ve made 
trouble for myself without meaning to be 
untrue. And I find it helps me with my 
lessons.” 

“And I have been learning that most of the 
faults you indulge in add to the burthen of 
some other person. You gratify your own 
self-will.” 

As for the flowers, they had varying for- 



tunes. Some were forgotten and dried up, 
some had too much nursing, others were left to 



take their chance. One girl had splendid luck 
with a pot of sweet alyssum that was a mass of 




white bloom. There were hyacinths, crocuses, 
geraniums, primroses, and the ordinary plants 
that did not require a wide knowledge. Alice 
had chosen a Bermuda lily. They were not as 
plentiful then as now. Last Spring she had 
spent a month at Bermuda with her parents 
and had fallen in love with the sweet white 
blossoms. She had studied the soil, she had 
never neglected it a day, and it had thriven 
wonderfully. Such a stout stalk, such deep- 
green leaves and then a bud head growing 
larger and larger, showing white in their long 
points, just ready to burst open. It was almost 
like a living thing to her and somehow sug- 
gested tall, pale mamma. She put it at the 
other end of the window to catch the last rays 
of light and stood a chair a short distance away 
while she went to Mrs. Allen’s for her cloth 
skirt that had a bad tear. Mrs. Allen mended 
and sometimes made garments for the girls. 

There were two very plain rooms, a sleep- 
ing chamber and living room, neat as a new

pin. And there was little Sadie Allen, who 
years ago had been thrown out of a wagon and 
crippled so that she seldom left the wheeling- 

 


chair. When her mother was out sewing the 
days were very long to her. 

‘‘I hope they will send me some of the 
church flowers to-morrow,’’ she said wistfully. 
‘*Or it will be Monday, I suppose, when they 
send them around to the hospital, and the 
orphans, and the old ladies. We had a gera- 
nium, but mother let it get frosted. And it 
must be just lovely to have a lot of flowers to 
keep Easter with. Why, it would be almost 
like heaven, where 

“ ‘Everlasting Spring abides 
And never withering flowers.’ ” 

Alice drew a long breath. Could she make 
an Easter offering of her firstfruits, her two 
lovely lilies that would open their white gates 
and show their golden treasures to celebrate 
the resurrection morning? No one has 
thought of poor little Sadie Allen. There 
would be more lilies out afterward, for her — 
but she should feel so proud of them all day 

 


long. She had meant to carry it down in the 
library where the girls spent Sunday after- 
noon talking with Mrs. Trevor. 

Then she looked at the pale little girl with 
longing, wistful eyes, who had so few delights. 

“I ’ll bring you two beautiful lilies in the 
morning,” she began hurriedly, lest she should 
repent. “I don’t believe you have ever seen 
anything like them, and they are so delicately 
fragrant. You can have them all day long and 
you can imagine you are in church.” 

The child caught Alice’s hands and kissed 
them rapturously, but she could not speak, 
and then Alice bent over and kissed her and
