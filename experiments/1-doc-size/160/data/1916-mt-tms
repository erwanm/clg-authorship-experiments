He saw that I was thinking a sarcasm, and he explained his position.

“I have wrought well for the villagers, though it does not look like
it on the surface. Your race never know good fortune from ill. They
are always mistaking the one for the other. It is because they cannot
see into the future. What I am doing for the villagers will bear good
fruit some day; in some cases to themselves; in others, to unborn
generations of men. No one will ever know that I was the cause, but
it will be none the less true, for all that. Among you boys you have
a game: you stand a row of bricks on end a few inches apart; you push
a brick, it knocks its neighbor over, the neighbor knocks over the
next brick--and so on till all the row is prostrate. That is human
life. A child’s first act knocks over the initial brick, and the rest
will follow inexorably. If you could see into the future, as I can,
you would see everything that was going to happen to that creature;
for nothing can change the order of its life after the first event
has determined it. That is, nothing will change it, because each act
unfailingly begets an act, that act begets another, and so on to the
end, and the seer can look forward down the line and see just when each
act is to have birth, from cradle to grave.”

“Does God order the career?”

“Foreordain it? No. The man’s circumstances and environment order it.
His first act determines the second and all that follow after. But
suppose, for argument’s sake, that the man should skip one of these
acts; an apparently trifling one, for instance; suppose that it had
been appointed that on a certain day, at a certain hour and minute and
second and fraction of a second he should go to the well, and he didn’t
go. That man’s career would change utterly, from that moment; thence
to the grave it would be wholly different from the career which his
first act as a child had arranged for him. Indeed, it might be that
if he had gone to the well he would have ended his career on a throne,
and that omitting to do it would set him upon a career that would lead
to beggary and a pauper’s grave. For instance: if at any time--say in
boyhood--Columbus had skipped the triflingest little link in the chain
of acts projected and made inevitable by his first childish act, it
would have changed his whole subsequent life, and he would have become
a priest and died obscure in an Italian village, and America would
not have been discovered for two centuries afterward. I know this. To
skip any one of the billion acts in Columbus’s chain would have wholly
changed his life. I have examined his billion of possible careers, and
in only one of them occurs the discovery of America. You people do not
suspect that all of your acts are of one size and importance, but it is
true; to snatch at an appointed fly is as big with fate for you as in
any other appointed act--”

“As the conquering of a continent, for instance?”

“Yes. Now, then, no man ever does drop a link--the thing has never
happened! Even when he is trying to make up his mind as to whether he
will do a thing or not, that itself is a link, an act, and has its
proper place in his chain; and when he finally decides an act, that
also was the thing which he was absolutely certain to do. You see, now,
that a man will never drop a link in his chain. He cannot. If he made
up his mind to try, that project would itself be an unavoidable link--a
thought bound to occur to him at that precise moment, and made certain
by the first act of his babyhood.”

It seemed so dismal!

“He is a prisoner for life,” I said sorrowfully, “and cannot get free.”

“No, of himself he cannot get away from the consequences of his first
childish act. But I can free him.”

I looked up wistfully.

“I have changed the careers of a number of your villagers.”

I tried to thank him, but found it difficult, and let it drop.

“I shall make some other changes. You know that little Lisa Brandt?”

“Oh yes, everybody does. My mother says she is so sweet and so lovely
that she is not like any other child. She says she will be the pride of
the village when she grows up; and its idol, too, just as she is now.”

“I shall change her future.”

“Make it better?” I asked.

“Yes. And I will change the future of Nikolaus.”

I was glad, this time, and said, “I don’t need to ask about his case;
you will be sure to do generously by him.”

“It is my intention.”

Straight off I was building that great future of Nicky’s in my
imagination, and had already made a renowned general of him and
hofmeister at the court, when I noticed that Satan was waiting for me
to get ready to listen again. I was ashamed of having exposed my cheap
imaginings to him, and was expecting some sarcasms, but it did not
happen. He proceeded with his subject:

“Nicky’s appointed life is sixty-two years.”

“That’s grand!” I said.

“Lisa’s, thirty-six. But, as I told you, I shall change their lives
and those ages. Two minutes and a quarter from now Nikolaus will wake
out of his sleep and find the rain blowing in. It was appointed that
he should turn over and go to sleep again. But I have appointed that
he shall get up and close the window first. That trifle will change
his career entirely. He will rise in the morning two minutes later
than the chain of his life had appointed him to rise. By consequence,
thenceforth nothing will ever happen to him in accordance with the
details of the old chain.” He took out his watch and sat looking at it
a few moments, then said: “Nikolaus has risen to close the window. His
life is changed, his new career has begun. There will be consequences.”

It made me feel creepy; it was uncanny.

“But for this change certain things would happen twelve days from now.
For instance, Nikolaus would save Lisa from drowning. He would arrive
on the scene at exactly the right moment--four minutes past ten, the
long-ago appointed instant of time--and the water would be shoal, the
achievement easy and certain. But he will arrive some seconds too late,
now; Lisa will have struggled into deeper water. He will do his best,
but both will drown.”

“Oh, Satan! oh, dear Satan!” I cried, with the tears rising in my eyes,
“save them! Don’t let it happen. I can’t bear to lose Nikolaus, he is
my loving playmate and friend; and think of Lisa’s poor mother!”

I clung to him and begged and pleaded, but he was not moved. He made me
sit down again, and told me I must hear him out.

“I have changed Nikolaus’s life, and this has changed Lisa’s. If I had
not done this, Nikolaus would save Lisa, then he would catch cold from
his drenching; one of your race’s fantastic and desolating scarlet
fevers would follow, with pathetic after-effects; for forty-six years
he would lie in his bed a paralytic log, deaf, dumb, blind, and praying
night and day for the blessed relief of death. Shall I change his life
back?”

“Oh no! Oh, not for the world! In charity and pity leave it as it is.”

“It is best so. I could not have changed any other link in his life
and done him so good a service. He had a billion possible careers,
but not one of them was worth living; they were charged full with
miseries and disasters. But for my intervention he would do his brave
deed twelve days from now--a deed begun and ended in six minutes--and
get for all reward those forty-six years of sorrow and suffering I told
you of. It is one of the cases I was thinking of awhile ago when I said
that sometimes an act which brings the actor an hour’s happiness and
self-satisfaction is paid for--or punished--by years of suffering.”

I wondered what poor little Lisa’s early death would save her from. He
answered the thought:

“From ten years of pain and slow recovery from an accident, and then
from nineteen years’ pollution, shame, depravity, crime, ending with
death at the hands of the executioner. Twelve days hence she will die;
her mother would save her life if she could. Am I not kinder than her
mother?”

“Yes--oh, indeed yes; and wiser.”
