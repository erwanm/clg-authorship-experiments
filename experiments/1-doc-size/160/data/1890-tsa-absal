III. 

One evening the whole party, after a long day's march, 
quite wearied out, arrived at our place of encampment, and 
as the servants were especially fatigued with carrying our 
heavy baggage, d'Allemand and I undertook the first 
watch and from time to time replenished the fire that 
was burning in our midst. About midnight we perceived 
a shaking and quaking of the earth as if a squadron of 
cavalry were dashing upon us. We immediately aroused 
our whole company except the baker, whom we allowed to 
snore on quietly, as he had as usual taken too much drink, 



 

and might perhaps, in such a confused state of mind, have 
committed some folly which would have ruined us all. 

Scarcely had friend Templyn, upon whose cool courage 
I placed the greatest reliance, rubbed the sleep from hia 
eyes, when we heard just behind us, from the crashing 
thicket, a clear piercing cry, and turning our frightened 
gaze in that direction, we saw the monster from whose 
throat it had proceeded, illuminated by the light of our 
fire — a huge elephant, who was glaring directly at us, and 
who whirled his trunk aloft in such a threatening manner, 
and so quickly, that we seemed to hear the whirring of a 
great spinning-wheel. We were just about to greet our 
unwelcome guest with a few bullets, when one of the 
servants, who had all hastily climbed the nearest treej 
besought us to desist, as the terrible creature would, if 
our balls did not happen to strike it just in the spot where 
a wound would be mortal, trample us all under his feet 
in his mad fury. If we took this advice we were entirely 
without means of defence, for unfortunately our torches 
and rockets lay so near the dreadful creature that any one 
attempting to seize them would meet with certain death. 
In this extremity we thought of our gongs, and instantly 
sounded them, with, as it proved, the very best success, 
for no sooner did the sound reach his ear than the monstei 
uttered a yell so loud and so terrible that the boldest heart 
quaked for fear. At the same time, in his fierce rage, he 
tore up with his trunk a young tree that stood near him 
by the roots, bent it up together, and crushed it under his 
feet like a cabbage-stalk. After thus moderately giving 
vent to his anger, he turned towards us again and appeared 



 

to be meditating a like destruction of our baggage. Invol- 
untarily we pressed forward to the rescue of our treasures, 
and uttered a loud piercing shout which was echoed back 
by our people in the tree, who now gave us up for lost. 
And as our gongs were all the while going like mad, our 
disagreeable guest found it so intolerable that, shaking his 
ears in a waggish manner to express his disapprobation of 
orur concert, he at last fairly turned round and made off. 
His retreat soon changed into such a hasty flight that in a 
few minutes he was out of the reach of the balls that we 
sent after him. 

So ended, happily enough, an adventure which had well- 
nigh put an end to our expedition ; at which we were all 
abundantly rejoiced, not merely because we had escaped 
with only a good fright, but also because in this first real 
danger we had discovered and learnt well how far we 
might depend upon our servants in such a time of need ; 
we immediately divided among them our torches and 
rockets that we might have something at hand to serve 
for weapons, for we had often heard, and can now testify, 
that nothing frightens even the most savage animals, so 
certainly as fire. 

Afl I had always been accustomed in any urgent situa- 
tion to rely upon myself I kept myself always prepared to 
meet the enemy at any moment, and earnestly warned our 
servants every evening to be upon their guard, and never 
during their watch allow themselves to be overcome by 
deep. But words are always easier than deeds, and on the 
following night I was unconsciously nodding when the two 
ervants wlio were watching with me, roused me with the 

 



 

cry of " master, a tiger !" Wide awake in a moment, I 
looked around, and they pointed me to two spar kling little 
balls that gleamed upon us from the thicket not far from 
our outermost watch-fire. There was no doubt that they 
were the eyes of a tiger who only awaited a favourable 
opportunity to seize and carry off some one of us. Father 
Templyn, our ever ready protector, was awakened, and we 
agreed to aim at the same time for the spot just between 
the two points of light. We shot and immediately heard 
a struggling and writhing as of some creature in the death 
struggle, which grew less and less distinct, and then 
oea,sed. In the meantime the noise of our rifles had roused 
the rest of our party, and as I really could keep awake 
no longer, the baker undertook to watch in my stead for 
the rest of the night. But at break of day we were again 
aroused by a joyful shout from him. He informed us that 
we had been fortunate enough to kill a Royal tiger of the 
largest size, and our servants were already engaged in skin- 
ning him. We found that both balls had taken effect, and 
had shattered his skull ; as then we had each an equal 
claim to the beautifully spotted hide, we drew lots for it, 
and fortune favored me. As soon as our people had 
finished their task of skinning the tiger, we again started 
on our way. 

We were now quite near to the mountains which cross 
the island, and as the path in the plain swarmed so with 
ants that we every moment simk deep into their nests 
and progress was most difiicult, we determined to ascend 
the mountains for a little distance in hopes of finding a 
better path and satisfying our curiosity as to the surround- 



 

ing country. This plan d'Allemand did not relish at all 
and he did his best to dissuade us from adopting it ; yet, 
had it not been for a sad accident which we shortly 
met with, and which frustrated our purpose, he would 
hardly have succeeded in altering our fixed determi- 
nation. 

We had already turned our steps in the direction deci- 
ded upon, when in passing by a thinly-clothed tree we 
observed a mass of honey — a bee hive so immense that it 
awakened in us a strong desire to possess it; but the 
bough from which it hung was so high as to preclude the 
possibility of smoking out the bees according to the usual 
custom. We were just turning from it when one of our 
servants offered to climl) the tree and chop off the bough 
with an axe, so that we could easily overcome our little 
enemies. We accepted his offer and promised him a 
double share of the sweet booty for his daring. The poor 
fellow climbed the tree and reached the heavily-laden 
bough in safety ; it already quivered with the first stroke 
of his axe, but he was prevented from giving another by 
the bees, who rushed raging in thick swarms fi"om their 
cells, and so cruelly attacked his naked body that he 
uttered a loud cry, and closing his eyes, turned to come 
down ; unfortunately, in his descent he made a mis-step, 
fell and broke his leg. This misfortune drew a cross 
through our reckoning — a continuation of our former plan 
was not to be thought of, as we could not possibly leave 
the sufferer to the mercy of fate, or rather to certain des- 
truction. Nothing was left for us but to place him upon a 
litter of boughs, hastily woven together, and seek the
