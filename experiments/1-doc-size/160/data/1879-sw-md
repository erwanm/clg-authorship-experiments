are generally somebody with whom Mr. Iredell has 
business to talk about, or somebody who is in want 
of social or material comfort. I can see that, in 
variety, from evening to evening; and I can see 
too how the comfort walks into them. People who 
are lonely ; people who are in trouble ; people who 
are poor; or people who are in feeble health and 
needing good food. They all get that, for the, dinners are excellent; and they get it along with so 
much true hospitality, such genial kindness, such 
lively, happy, good talk, that they all get comforted 
up. It is strange, pitiful and glad at once, to sea 
the lines of a weary face change after the first 
spoonful of soup. It is lovely to see how the saJ 
consciousness of a threadbare coat and generally 
shabby exterior is gradually charmed out of a man's 
mind by kindness and the mental and spiritual play 
of the conversation; charmed away, so that the 
brow is lifted up, and the eyes look straight out, 
and timidity and hesitancy vanish and give place 
to a free manner. The people are made to forget 
themselves. It is a study to me, night after night. 
Night after night I see Mr. Iredell have a new 
variety of character to deal with, or a new phasia 
of human downheartedness to lift up; and I see 
him do it; and I wonder and admire, sometimes 
till the tears come into my eyes, at the grace and 
skill and versatility of resources with which he does 
it. I help all I can, of course ; and enjoy the whole thing mightily. Olive does her part as the lady of 



 

the house; no more. The arrangement is not to 
her taste. 

" Such a fancy ! " she broke out one evening, 
when she and I had withdrawn to the library. 
"No other woman in town, I am sure, has such 
dinner guests." 

" I do not believe there is one," I assented. 

" Such a crazy hobby ! " she went on. 

" Do you think so ? " 

" Mr. Iredell does not seem to care whom he 
brings home with him." 

" Only, it is sure to be somebody who is in need 
of it." 

"Need!" said Olive. "Don't you think he might 
consider my need a little ? This worn-out old mis 
sionary now, this evening ! My dear, his coat was 
buttoned up close because he had not a shirt fit to 
shew under it." 

" But how delicious his telling of shooting grouse 
at the West ! " 

"I wonder why he did not stay there ! " 

" But, Olive, did you see how good the grouse 
was to him in another capacity to-day? not to 
shoot, but to eat ? " 

" They all want to eat," said Olive. "J would 
have a different sort of dinner for them; and I 
would give it to them in a restaurant." 

"It would not do them the good, Olive," said I. 
And I thought of the, " Inasmuch as ye have done 
it unto one of the least of these " 

"So unreasonable?" said Olive, not minding me. 



 

" But do you recollect, the Bible says, if thou 
bring the poor that are cast out to thine house ; it 
does not say, to a restaurant." 

" I suppose there were no restaurants in those 
days." 

Presently Mr. Iredell came in. He brought no 
strangers to the library. By eight o'clock, or half 
past eight at latest, they are gone, and he comes 
to us there. And then, for the remainder of the 
evening, he reads aloud to us. Reads and talks; 
for reading leads to talking inevitably ; and our entertainment is of the richest description. Sometimes it is a new book, sometimes an old one. 
Sometimes it is science, sometimes art, sometimes 
fiction; in fact it is of all possible sorts, and the 
talk takes all possible lines, conforming or diverg 
ing. The pleasure of these evenings, I am afraid, 
is too much. I am in danger of getting too fond 
of them ; for these are not a part of my life ; only 
a casualty. I cannot help it; I must enjoy while I 
have them. The very room in which we sit height 
ens the effect. Like all the rest of the house, it is 
dark and quaint; it is large, holds a great many 
books, and is built round an angle of the central 
hall, in a very odd way, forming an L. It has a 
dark waxed floor, with rugs and mats and carpets 
laid down here and there ; and of course an open 
fireplace, in front of which we gather. At half 
past ten, or eleven, Olive and I take our departure. 



 



Dec. 22. 

I HAD last evening what I did not want; the 
hearing, namely, of a talk that I was not 
meant to hear. It was afternoon, rather, not just 
evening. Mr. Iredell was going out to dinner, as 
I understood, and I made sure the library was 
empty; so I took the opportunity to go there and 
study at my leisure Dore's illustrations of the Bible. 
I was in the easiest of easy chairs, with the great 
book on a stand before me; and as long as light 
served I looked and studied to my heart's content. 
Light failed at last, and I meant to light the gas 
and go on; but I was in no hurry. I was very 
comfortably placed ; I was willing to rest my eyes 
and head for a little, during the "blind man's holiday " ; and I fell into a long muse, in which light 
and dark were so blended that I no longer knew 
which was which. As the daylight waned, by and 
by a ray of moonlight faintly stole in at the window. I do not know why, but as straight and as 
cold as itself it carried my thoughts home. That 
same moon was shining on Chesterfield valley: 
there was my place ; what did I here in Philadelphia, in Mr. Iredell's library, luxuriating in Dore 
and an easy chair? Would this sort of thing fit 
me for my own proper sphere and life-work, to 
which I must give myself? In Chesterfield valley 
art was not known; luxury not regarded; the hard 
business of every -day concerns filled all hands. 
Not all heads so exclusively but that Farmer Binnacle could philosophize and Deacon Parsons specu 
late; and they and others read the debates in 
Congress, and held in sober and sharp review the 
doings and the characters of public men. There 
was interest in more liberal knowledge too; and 
some of the women of Chesterfield were great 
readers. But of that delicate world of art, where
