seem a little pushing, if she does wish to withdraw herself 
though I am bound to say I think she makes a mistake; 
we could work up these last hours for her ! But can't 
you tell me any little personal items the sort of thing the 
pepple like? What is she going to have for supper? or 
is she going to speak a without previous nourishment ? ' 

'Really, sir, I don't know, and I don't in the least 
care ; I have nothing to do with the business ! ' Mrs. Luna 
cried, angrily. 

The reporter stared ; then, eagerly, ' You have nothing 
to do with it you take an unfavourable view, you pro- 
test?' And he was already feeling in a side -pocket for 
his note-book. 

' Mercy on us ! are you going to put that in the paper? ' 
Mrs. Luna exclaimed ; and in spite of the sense, detestable 
to him, that everything he wished most to avert was fast 
closing over the girl, Ransom broke into cynical laughter. 

' Ah, but do protest, madam ; let us at least have that 
fragment !' Mr. Pardon went on. ' A protest from this 
house would be a charming note. We must have it 
we've got nothing else ! The public are almost as much 



 

interested in your sister as they are in Miss Verena ; they 
know to what extent she has backed her : and I should 
be so delighted (I see the heading, from here, so attract- 
ive ! ) just to take down " What Miss Chancellor's Family 
Think about It!"' 

Mrs. Luna sank into the nearest chair, with a groan, 
covering her face with her hands. ' Heaven help me, I am 
glad I am going to Europe !' 

'That is another little item everything counts,' said 
Matthias Pardon, making a rapid entry in his tablets. 
' May I inquire whether you are going to Europe in con- 
sequence of your disapproval of your sister's views?' 

Mrs. Luna sprang up again, almost snatching the memo- 
randa out of his hand. ' If you have the impertinence 
to publish a word about me, or to mention my name in 
print, I will come to your office and make such a scene ! ' 

' Dearest lady, that would be a godsend ! ' Mr. Pardon 
cried, enthusiastically ; but he put his- note-book back into 
his pocket. 

' Have you made an exhaustive search for Miss Tarrant?' 
Basil Ransom asked of him. Mr. Pardon, at this inquiry, 
eyed him with a sudden, familiar archness, expressive of 
the idea of competition ; so that Ransom added : ' You 
needn't be afraid, I'm not a reporter.' 

' I didn't know but what you had come on from New 
York.' 

' So I have but not as the representative of a news- 
paper.' 

' Fancy his taking you ' Mrs. Luna murmured, with 

indignation. 

' Well, I have been everywhere I could think of,' Mr. 
Pardon remarked. ' I have been hunting round after your 
sister's agent, but I haven't been able to catch up with 
him ; I suppose he has been hunting on his side, Miss 
Chancellor told me Mrs. Luna may remember it that 
she shouldn't be here at all during the week, and that she 
preferred not to tell me either where or how she was to 
spend her time until the momentous evening. Of course 
I let her know that I should find out if I could, and you 
may remember,' he said to Mrs. Luna, '  the conversation 



 

we had on the subject. I remarked, candidly, that if they 
didn't look out they would overdo the quietness. Doctor 
Tarrant has felt very low about it. However, I have done 
what I could with the material at my command, and the 
" Vesper " has let the public know that her whereabouts 
was the biggest mystery of the season. It's difficult to 
get round the " Vesper." ' 

' I am almost afraid to open my lips in your presence.' 
Mrs. Luna broke in, 'but I must say that I think my 
sister was strangely communicative. She told you ever so 
much that I wouldn't have breathed.' 

'I should like to try you with something you know !' 
Matthias Pardon returned, imperturbably. ' This isn't a 
fair trial, because you don't know. Miss Chancellor came 
round came round considerably, there's no doubt of that ; 
because a year or two ago she was terribly unapproachable. If 
I have mollified her, madam, why shouldn't I mollify you ? 
She realises that I can help her now, and as I ain't ran- 
corous I am willing to help her all she'll let me. The 
trouble is, she won't let me enough, yet ; it seems as if she 
couldn't believe it of me. At any rate/ he pursued, ad- 
dressing himself more particularly to Ransom, 'half an 
hour ago, at the Hall, they knew nothing whatever about 
Miss Tarrant, beyond the fact that about a month ago she 
came there, with Miss Chancellor, to try her voice, which 
rang all over the place, like silver, and that Miss Chancellor 
guaranteed her absolute punctuality to-night.' 

' Well, that's all that is required,' said Ransom, at 
hazard; and he put out his hand, in farewell, to Mrs. 
Luna. 

' Do you desert me already ? ' she demanded, giving him 
a glance which would have embarrassed any spectator but 
a reporter of the 'Vesper.' 

' I have fifty things to do ; you must excuse me.' He 
was nervous, restless, his heart was beating much faster than 
usual ; he couldn't stand still, and he had no compunction 
whatever about leaving her to get rid, by herself, of Mr. 
Pardon. 

This gentleman continued to mix in the conversation, 
possibly from the hope that if he should linger either Miss 



 

Tarrant or Miss Chancellor would make her appearance. 
' Every seat in the Hall is sold ; the crowd is expected to 
be immense. When our Boston public does take an idea ! ' 
Mr. Pardon exclaimed. 

Ransom only wanted to get away, and in order to 
facilitate his release by implying that in such a case he 
should see her again, he said to Mrs. Luna, rather hypo- 
critically, from the threshold, 'You had really better come 
to-night.' 

' I am not like the Boston public I don't take an idea!' 
she replied. 

'Do you mean to say you are not going?' cried Mr. 
Pardon, with widely-open eyes, clapping his hand again to 
his pocket. ' Don't you regard her as a wonderful genius ?' 

Mrs. Luna was sorely tried, and the vexation of seeing 
Ransom slip away from her with his thoughts visibly on 
Verena, leaving her face to face with the odious newspaper- 
man, whose presence made passionate protest impossible 
the annoyance of seeing everything and every one mock at 
her and fail to compensate her was such that she lost her
