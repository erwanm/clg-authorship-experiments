bright with earnest affection. Tessy reached out her arms 
to him, and was kissed again and again. 

" Why did you think of coming for me?" he asked, in 
surprise. 

" O, we do every day," was Tessy's joyous answer. 

" Because you expect me ? " and he laughed. 

" Not quite. And Bel didn't want to come to-day, 
but " 

"You made her, I suppose, little tyrant. You look im- 
proved already. Are you not going to offer me a seat ? or 
do you purpose to have me walk r " 

She sprang up, and as soon as he was settled, nestled in 
his lap. Mabel bestowed wondering glances on him, and 
asked for the third or fourth time if he was well. 

" Entirely so." He put the reins in Tessy's hands, hold- 
ing his own over them, and bending down, whispered, " I 
was not wanted at Newport. I have come back to be all 
yours." 

The words gave her a pang as she took in their full 
meaning. Yet she hardly knew what an aching heart the 
tender manner to Tessy covered. 

They were all overjoyed to have him back so unexpect- 
edly. Lily and Archie had quantities of adventures to re- 





late. Indeed, Mabel scarcely had a look at him until they 
were all sent off to bed, after he had, as a special favor, 
sung Tessy to sleep. Then he bade Mabel find a shawl, 
and come to walk on the beach with him. 

The tide was going out, leaving the shining sand smooth 
as a floor. The dim and lonely reaches of the broad ocean 
flowed onward with a sad, mighty pulsation, the slow, regu- 
lar swells breaking into a rhythmic melody a grand chant 
of ceaseless sorrow. Along the western sky sailed fleecy 
islands in a sea of wondrous azure. Above them were hosts 
of golden stars, the crown of the summer night. It was 
just the hour for a fond confidence, and Richard opened his 
heart to the fair girl blossoming into pure and lovely 
womanhood. Her tender sympathy soothed him immeasu- 
rably. He said calmly, but not in despair, that his dream 
of love was over. Henceforth he was to fill the position of 
elder brother in its truest, widest sense. There was nothing 
to come between him and his duty now ; no temptation to 
lure him from that precious household. 

It was well, perhaps, that Mabel did not see all. Alone 
in his room, with the sorrowful midnight stars for watchers, 
he laid aside the mask from his heart, and glanced at it, as 
he only might do for many a weary day to come. He did 
not so much regret Ada ; he seemed to understand now the 
wants and trivialities of her nature, the petty trials to which 
she would have continually subjected him. He was content 
to have her choose another. But the keen sense of desola- 
tion after he had shrouded the corse of a sweet first love, 
and silently borne it to a place of sepulture, was what re- 
mained with him, and left a nameless pain. As in death no 
faults are remembered, so he recalled the earlier days of 
their acquaintance, when love was haloed with the rose-hue 
of newness. Could any after passion be so sweet? He 
said then for him there could be no second spring. The 
grave in his heart could never outgrow its greenness. He 
felt how truly, how tenderly, he had loved. 





And so came one of life's sorest lessons to Richard Ber- 
trand. Was it to teach him patience, forbearance ? He 
took it in that wise, quite humbly, as a little child. He re- 
membered who had said, " All things shall work together 
for good." Others had walked in shaded pathways, and 
found rest at last. And for him, hereafter, love and duty 
would be as one word. 







CHAPTER X. 

So many feet that day by day 
Still wander from the fold astray. 

GOLDEN LEGEND. 

As it was impossible for Richard to remain at Cape May, 
he compromised with the children by promising to come 
once a week during their stay. Tessy improved as if by 
magic. When September arrived, aunt Sophy begged for 
another month, but Mabel longed to be again at home. Mrs. 
Hall and Ann were delighted with their return. Robert 
came back in a high state of satisfaction, and had plenty 
of adventures to relate to the younger ones. Yet there was 
something in his light-heartedness that rather pained than 
pleased. Excitement and enjoyment appeared to be his 
continual study. He possessed the brilliant and dangerous 
qualities that make 'men favorites of society and slaves to 
temptation. Easy and generous they are called, yet many 
a weary burden do they lay upon others. 

Richard could only pray for him when they separated. 
And in his frequent letters he strove to keep up an interest 
in home affairs for the absent one. Mabel, who had given 
up school, devoted herself assiduously to the household, and 
endeavored to make all around her happy. Love reigned 
perfect among them. 

It was a quiet, uneventful winter. Christmas brought 
aunt Sophy and the cousins. Yet the day was not gone 
through without tears. There was a missing voice, a place 
unfilled memories infinitely tender and infinitely sad. 

Ada Townley's marriage occurred at this period. It as- 





sistcd Richard to recover his mental tone somewhat. He 
no longer asked himself, in weak moments, if he had not 
been hasty or unjust. No good, faithful, affectionate man 
can easily tear up the tendrils that have twined around his 
very life. He will not in a moment forget the hope that was 
to have made glad all his future years. He may say, "I 
will dream no more," but in lonely hours 

" The spirit that no exorcism can bind " 

will rise from the deepest grave. But Richard's sorrow 
strengthened and ennobled him. He did not look on the 
passion dreams of his young summer with hard, scornful re- 
gret. Duty and sacrifice were no self-scourging bonds whose 
chain clanked with every movement. He had been " wounded 
in the house of a friend," but he did not forget there were 
others to heal. Glancing down the days yet to come, he saw 
himself the ready helper, the comforter in trouble, and the 
sharer of others' joys. He would bless their marriage vows 
when the birdlings left the old home nest. And if, at tne 
last, he was left alone by the fireside, he would be content 
with whatever God should send him. 

They went on evenly again until one March night. In the 
very room where their father had gayly frolicked with them 
that last dear evening, and kissed them with tenderest affec-
