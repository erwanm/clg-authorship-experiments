" I will not believe" it ! " said Mrs. Walsingham, in- 
dignantly. 

"But Tremaine must know where she is. There is 
a look about the affair, that I do not like, and I shall 
fathom it to the bottom. But if she should have a 
lingering regard for this scoundrel ! " 

"My sweet, suffering child ! Who will find her. Oh, 
that I had never given her up ! " 

" Mother dear, we will make amends for all that," 
said her son, fondly. " Did you not say that Cameron 
was coming this evening ? " 

"Yes. If we can compel him to tell?" and she 
looked up uncertainly. 

"I think I had better see Tremaine," said Mr. 
Eastman. 

It was noon, then, and the little party dispersed until 
evening. Eastman found himself unexpectedly busy, 
and when he called at Tremaine's store, learned that it 
it was quite possible he might go directly to Woodlea, 
if he should be a little late. 

So to Woodlea went Mr. Eastman, with what success 
the reader already knows . It puzzled him, not a little, 
to think such an event could have occurred in their 
very midst, as tins episode of Mr. Tremaine's wife, and 
led to no gossip. He had met Tremaine several times, 
within the past month, though, now, he remembered that 
he had a rather careworn look. To get at the truth, 
with as little delay as possible, was his business f 





Then he bethought himself of the evening and 
Cameron's promised visit. He could be better em- 
ployed elsewhere, and Mrs. Walsingham's extreme in- 
terest might work all parties harm. So he telegraphed 
to her not to see Cameron, until after he had been, 
rather to go out, for awhile, in the evening. He would 
explain when he saw her. 

" Now for Catherine Dawson, and the link she may 
be able to add ; " he thought, and, then — if this Dora 
Tremaine, or Cameron were really worth the fortune and 
the love awaiting her ! 

He had some difficulty in finding the place, and Mark 
Dawson was on guard. He eyed Mr. Eastman in a 
suspicious manner, but was initially persuaded into sum- 
moning his wife. 
. Catherine seemed sharper still, than her husband. 

" I want to know if Mrs. Tremaine is, at present, re- 
siding or staying here?" he asked, in a quiet tone, 
though he was somewhat vexed with the woman's air of 
caution. 

"Whatright have you to be questioning?*' he de- 
manded, brusquely. 

" If }'ou are Mrs. Tremaine's sincere friend, you may 
believe in me fully. I came altogether in her behalf. 
I know nearly all her history. Jasper Cameron, her 
former husband, has had it in his power to work her 
much difficulty and suffering. I cannot believe that she 
loves him, and it is to thwart his schemes, that I ha~ 
come." 



"Q, from Mr. Tremaine— ? " 

."No, from a dearer friend, still, mayhap. If I could 
but see her." 

Catherine was unbelieving, again. 

"Mrs. Tremaine is an invalid," she replied stiffly. 
u I will give her any message you may choose to leave, 
but she cannot be disturbed." 

Had the face been less steadfast and true, the lawyer's 
patience would have been sorely tried. 

" Then you must assist me," he continued. u First, 
I want to know if Dora Verner, as she was called, was, 
in reality, Mr. Verner's niece ; or was she given to Mrs. 
Denver by her own mother? " 

"She always believed herself Mrs. Denver's daugh- 
ter ; " said Catherine, astonished. 

" And does she really love Mr. Cameron?" 

"Love him? She hates the sight of him ! Oh sir — " 

"Has Mr. Tremaine been here? Does he know?" 

"He knows, I am quite sure. She wrote to him. 
And she saw him once, but it was not here." 

"It is an awkward position, certainly. Do you not 
think you can persuade her to see me? She can have 
no firmer friend than I shall prove. An interview with 
her is important." 

Catherine went, rather unwillingly, and yet she waji 
beginning to have a certain confidence in the man. 

"No," Dora said, in reply, " I cannot see him. Tell 
him anything he desires to know, Catherine, but it 




would half kill me to be questioned. There, go back 
to him and excuse me. I cannot gratify any one's 
curiosity." 

Mr. Eastman was a good deal disconcerted, but he 
addressed himself to Mrs. Dawson in a business-like 
manner, and learned from her the particulars of Dora's 
marriage to Cameron, and the miserable secret, it had 
been to her. There was a link between, that Jasper 
Cameron could best supply, doubtless, with his stolen 
papers, but, that she was truly Mrs. Walsingham's child, 
hardly admitted of dispute. 

u And, now, in return for your confidence, I will ex- 
plain my mystery," Eastman said, with a smile. " Mrs. 
Tremaine has both friends and fortune awaiting her. 
It is one of the queer romances we lawyer's occasionally 
unravel. She was not Mrs. Denver's child, and her 
own mother has returned from Europe. And, as I men- 
tioned before, she is heiress to a considerable fortune." 

" It was that, that Jasper Cameron wanted ! I knew, 
and so did she, poor darling, that it was not love ; " said 
Catherine, her face full of amazement. 

" You are quite sure she does not care for him ? For, 
by his own showing, he is a villain." 

" And you can get her free? " was the eager inquiry. 

" At her desire, easily." 

"Then, the Lord be praised !" she ejaculated, clasp- 
ing her hands.
