afterwards ; " but Mrs. Marshall will make a very queen 
of milliners. She has perfectly bewitching taste, and her 
manners are simply superb. No fear but she will keep 
her place, and that regal air of hers does inspire confi- 
dence. She must have had some training ; no 'one could 
take up a business and understand all its little niceties so 
thoroughly. I do wonder what has become of her hus- 
band, and if she is divorced. One can find out from the

cousin. 

That lady was not a gossip in the ordinary sense, but 
the circle in which Mrs. Marshall had once moved was 
soon duly astounded by the news of such an unheard-of 
undertaking. If it had been school or music teaching, 
or any graceful trifle ; but to fly in the face of family 
tradition I 



CHAPTER VII. 

M Everyone is as God made him, and oftentimes a great deal worse." 

— Cebvaxtes. 

What had become of Thomas Marshall? Eleanor as 
well as others asked it in vain. She might have learned ; 
she was seized with a wild longing to disguise herself and 
revisit the old haunts, but she was too busy day and even- 
ing for any such escapade. The season, the taste displayed 
by the "new milliner," and curiosity, led many hither. 
Was it really Eleanor Marshall who had married so ele- 
gantly, who had been their guest, whose dinners and 
receptions had been quite the rage ten or twelve years 
ago? The young mothers and the older mothers remem- 
bered her well ; and the young girls heard the story, and 
sauntered down Main Street with a strange feeling of in- 
terest and wonder that so elegant a woman should take 
up such an occupation after the education she must have 
received. 

Mrs. Marshall was simply a woman of business. Her 
innate dignity, and the delicate pride that ever baffles, 
stood her in good stead now ; but there was a mystery. 
No one had heard any complaints ; in fact no one seemed 
to know exactly what the Marshalls had been doing for 
the last three or four years ; and, whatever it was, it had 
not rested very heavily upon her was the verdict of 
society. She showed no unusual traces of care or per- 
plexity. 

In truth Eleanor had one of those — shall I say fortu- 
nate or unfortunate temperaments of intense and exceed- 
ing vitality, and a buoyancy often mistaken for hope, as 
well as a degree of indifference. So far her physical health 



had not suffered materially. The change, activity, and 
excitement of her new business acted like a draught of 
some rare century-old wine. Her step grew more elastic, 
her smile more frequent, and it had always been a fasci- 
nating one. She tried honestly and earnestly to make 
herself a success, and the very energy she threw into it 
seemed to vitalize every pulse, r 

Celia, too, interested her curiously. The child made 
her half a dozen Easter panels in various colored velvets 
and satins, and fastened clusters of flowers to them. But 
the one in which she took the greatest delight was a cross 
of white silk violets with golden stamens on a black vel- 
vet background. She had obtained from a stationer, in 
small gilt letters, the words, " Christ is risen." It was so 
neatly and artistically done that the mother praised gen- 
erously. 

" Dear mamma," began Celia, " I hope no one will want 
to buy it, for I feel as if this should be your Easter gift. 
I have never made you anything choice and beautiful, — 
there always were so many necessary things to do." 

But, alas ! the very first one to be sold was this. 

They had talked the price over with sensible Miss 
Parker. Celia said, — 

" Those we saw in New York were from two to five 
dollars. Mine are all prettier than the cheapest, but not 
quite so elaborate as the dearest." 

"Then say three-fifty for the two finest, three for the 
next, and two-and-a-half for the others. If they hang a 
little, you can lower the price." 

So Celia put four of them in the window the next 
Saturday, and three were sold, her cross, as I have 
said, going first of all. Early in the next week, the 
rest went; and she made two more, one a cross of purple 
violets on a white satin background. This caught the 
eye of Ada Brocklehurst, who was extremely enthusiastic 
over it. 



 

When Celia paid her mother for materials used, she 
found she had nearly seventeen dollars left. 

"O mamma!" and her eyes sparkled with delight; 
" would you have dreamed that I could do anything like 
that ? And now I want to buy some paints ; and, if you 
will teach me a little, I know I could learn." 

She was in a tremor of happy excitement. 

" My darling," said her mother tenderly, " listen to me 
a moment. My painting was merely a young lady's 
accomplishment, and I have mostly forgotten that. 
I would rather have you take lessons of some good 
teacher. But you know we both feel anxious about your 
examination for the High School, and you will have some 
hard studying to do. Suppose you lay away your money, 
and wait until vacation, when you have nothing else 
to do ; and then you can devote your whole attention to 
it." 

Celia consented with secret reluctance, although she 
knew it was the wisest plan. A new possibility had 
opened before her child, Eleanor realized. A month ago 
her highest ambition for Celia had been the vocation of a 
teacher. True, this might prove only a girl's enthusiasm, 
but her inmost soul responded to the earnest belief that 
it was something higher. Work would be Celia's por- 
tion; and she wanted to choose something that would 
inspire her years of womanhood, not merely to make a 
temporary bridge to marriage. 

After Easter, business went steadily on. An appren- 
tice was taken and a new worker engaged. Eleanor was 
very quick and deft, and she employed every moment, 
making her household duties as light as possible. Many 
a night her lamp burned late, and her busy fingers flew as 
if by magic. Until she was out of debt she must strain 
every nerve. 

Often during these quiet hours she thought of her hus- 
band. April had passed. The new tenant had taken 





possession of Mrs. Beach's apartments, doubtless; and 
where was he? a homeless vagrant, sleeping and eating 
wherever he could find shelter for a trifle ! There were 
times when she felt she must go out and search the 
streets, and bring home the wanderer, when her heart 
ached and her eyes overflowed with tears, when she
