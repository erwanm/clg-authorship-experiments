yet tired of driving about the country roads and 
swinging in a hammock with a gown that would 
bear crushing. 

To some people you gave bread. There was 
shelter, clothing, sympathy ; then came pleasure. 
Why had she been so blind to it all ? Why, the 
world was full of work, necessity, and delight ! 
The Lord had made the grass to grow and the 
green herb. He had made the flowers as well. 
There were the countless stars, the mountains 
and the seas, the works that praised him. And 
here was a longing soul she could delight. How 
. had she been so slow to understand } 

When Pearl came back she found many things 
to say to Mrs. Slater. The woman answered in 
her phlegmatic fashion ; but the lines of her face 
relaxed, and she might have smiled if she had not 



been so out of practice. The warmth of the im- 
pulse stirred her soul, and the bunch of flowers 
Pearl gathered and begged her to take home to 
the children was received with awkward gratitude. 

" I'd rather granny had 'em, if it's all the same 
to you. We ain't much hands for posy gardenin' ; 
there's too much work for such things, but granny 
— she'll be mighty pleased." 

Yes, Pearl could always remember the cup of 
cold water. 

After Aunt Jane had come home and laid aside 
her things and looked out that everybody was 
comfortable, Sabrina carried her off to her own 
room. 

"I've something to ask of you. Aunt Jane," she 
said in her persuasive way, and put her hand out 
over the one that had toiled for so many years. 
"I want to take Stacy to Niagara, but two young 
girls couldn't well go alone. There must be some 
elder woman to care for them. And if you would ! 
Then you could go on to your sister's afterward." 

"My dear! And Niagara! An old woman like 
me!" 

Sabrina smiled with a warmth and sweetness 
that went far toward rendering refusal impossible. 

" But — well, I'd hardly know how to act ! " Mrs. 
Herrick laughed, with a ring of positive pleas- 
ure in the mellow notes. "I dare say I'd be like 




some of the women they laugh about in the pa- 
pers ; Td bristle all over with exclamation points, 
and stand gaping about, until you'd be ashamed. 
But Stacy'd be just wild. The professor stayed a 
couple of weeks later than usual this summer, and 
he used to sit out on the stoop a while in the even- 
ings and talk, and somehow he stirred Stacy all up 
telling of the wonderful places and countries he had 
seen. She's been kinder quiet and dumpy since, 
and reading over some of his books. It's a great, 
beautiful world, Miss Eastwood, but everybody 
doesn't get leave to travel all round it. I comfort 
myself with the thought that there'll be all heaven ; 
and if God made the earth so wonderful, he isn't 
going to fail the poor souls who can never see 
more than their own little corner. There'll be 
rivers of delight and plains spread out in some- 
thing more glorious than sunshine, and valleys 
and heights. And you'll have all eternity to see 
it. That isn't to say there's no need of enjoying 
what you can here. I ain't that narrow. And 
Stacy'U be just wild! I had half a mind to let 
her go off with some of the girls, but I didn't feel 
quite forehanded enough to fix her up nice and 
give her plenty to spend. Stacy's a good, sensi- 
ble girl. But you two would be so pretty and 
nice that an old woman like me would most shame 
you." 





She looked so entii;ply pleased with the compli- 
ment that had been paid her! It was almost as 
good as the journey. 

''But pretty girls could not go alone, and nice 
girls would not,' Sabrina smiled in her most 
persuasive fashion. "We must have you for the 
dignity and propriety. And I hoped you would 
like to go." 

" Like to go ! My dear child ! Why, it would 
be a bit of heaven beforehand ! You are as sweet 
as a rose to think of it. I don't know but you'll 
get to be like Pearl, planning out things for 
people." 

"Thank you for that compliment," and a limpid- 
ness suffused Sabrina's eyes. "Now, you must 
let Stacy understand that you care to go, that it 
is not all on our account." 

" O my dear, I haven't grown too old to 
hanker a little after the pleasures of the world 
that God made. If he'd put them way up to the 
North Pole, then we'd known for sure they were 
out of the reach of most people ; but he lets folks 
live right around the Falls, and out West in those 
wonderful places, and all over Europe; so he 
means there shall not be any question. It's only 
whether people have the time and the money. 
And I've got to get a new carpet for one of the 
rooms — young fellows do scrape out things so." 





"And I really owe you all this and more," cried 
Sabrina. "You were so good to me" — 

"That's nothing, child. No one could have 
been cross to such a delicate little mite as you 
used to be, never giving a bit of trouble. But 
you'll never know how good it was to see you 
come back, grown up into such a tall, pretty girl, 
and remembering little things that had been 
a'most crowded out of my mind." 

Her voice broke a little, and she put her arms 
about Sabrina and kissed her. Women or girls 
rarely kissed Miss Eastwood. She always held 
herself aloof from effusiveness. 

That very evening, as she was rambling about 
the old garden with Stacy, she laid the plan before 
her. These two girls had been curious, outside 
friends. Both felt a little afraid of the other. 
Stacy had rather a sharp, satiric tongue, and she 
had said to Aunt Jane, "she wasn't going to bow 
down to Miss Eastwood's money." She had her 
own dignity, and she was not the kind of a girl to 
be patronized. All the same, she secretly coveted 
about half the fortune. Half would make her 
"passing rich;" and more than once Sabrina had 
longed for Stacy's "good times," and the genu- 
ine love and admiration so frankly proffered. She
