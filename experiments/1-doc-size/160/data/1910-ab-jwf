justice when she could. 

Winterbourne found he liked the atmosphere. Here was 
a table and a fire burning on the hearth, here were three 
pretty women to look at. As he ate he warmed, and forgot, 
for a moment, the curtailment of his liberties. It was Celia 
who led the talk, with charming insincerities of interest in 
what, Winterbourne knew, did not fit her actual tastes. But 
he was being fed and munificently forgave her ; he need not 
listen very hard. One touch of nature there was in her real 
curiosity about Dwight Hunter. He was quite unusual, she 
proclaimed ; but when it was explained to her that he was 
not really an expressman or really a ploughman, except by 
choice, and that he had a college career behind him, she 
seemed to welcome the harmonizing of things. 

" That explains it," she said, with great satisfaction. 



 





" Explains what?" Winterbourne asked. 

" Why, he 's a gentleman. Lilian, didn't you feel that he 
was a gentleman ? '' 

The other girl always seemed to respond patiently when 
she was called Lilian ; but she was bringing in the omelet, 
evidently soothed in all ways by its completeness, and could 
answer out of that primary interest, " I didn't know." 

" What is a gentleman ? " asked Winterbourne. 



 



VII 

LOVELL was lost without his friend and his evening 
haunt. For the last three years he had spent several 
hours of every day with Winterbourne, keeping 
pace with him, approximately, in Greek ; and when Win- 
terbourne dropped off after his wife got home, Lovell felt 
bereft. He stepped about his little camping house, — a long 
living-room, a bedroom and a kitchen, — and even after 
Mary Manahan had done her daily adjusting in an ever- 
fresh domain, made himself homespun tasks, then to settle 
down in the austere quiet of it, to read and write. He had a 
hatred of disorder in the measure of Winterbourne's toler- 
ance of it, and his little shell, though it was wholly lacking in 
touches of ornamentation, gave a feeling of light and space. 
A workman of any sort, in the arts, or even a lover of the 
aspects of life, would have been happy there. It had two 
requisites of beauty and comfort : the fireplaces were large 
and the furniture was old. Lovell, a hermit in a village way, 
had not thought before how much he depended on Winter- 
bourne for the bread of life, — silent accord, great laughter, 
kindred tastes. Perhaps without him and his own careless 
days undisturbed by womenfolk or concession to civil de- 
mands, he might not have been living so contentedly in his 
little house, mirthfully escaping ladies who forced upon him 
gentle hospitalities. Winterbourne had, without effort, made 
the eccentric way seem perfectly feasible and natural : to 
Hunter, also, who lived alone, when he was not driving about 
the country on his various missions, he too relying on Mary 
Manahan to keeo for him a pretence of outer comfort. 



 





On the fifth night, when Lovell was settling to his book, 
— a solitary pursuit now, almost become a task, — Winter- 
bourne came. Lovell heard him pounding down the path, an 
offshoot from the driveway to the great house, threw open 
the door, and stood there, an image of the ready host. It 
was a night suddenly cold, and Winterbourne had resumed 
his winter greatcoat with the cape. He wore a slouch hat 
and carried a stick ; he was a picturesque figure of another 
time when, even in men's attire, the flowing line prevailed. 
He came in silently, laid his books on the table, and threw 
aside his coat. 

Lovell, in his anticipation of renewed comradeship, looked 
quite boyish. His eyes glowed and his sanguine cheeks had 
color. These last nights the room had been expectant of 
Winterbourne's coming, table ready to be drawn up, two 
chairs waiting by it, and the mugs yawning for beer. 

Winterbourne threw himself into one of the chairs and 
drew a long breath. He wrinkled his forehead as if pathet- 
ically remembering forsaken cares, and then looked about 
the room. He spoke interrogatively and with a suggestion 
of weariness, — 

" I guess we shall like this just as well, Jim ? " 

Lovell nodded. It was to be perfectly recognized between 
them that Winterbourne's own house had been rendered 
uninhabitable by the advent of sprightliness and beauty. 
Lovell laid his hand upon a book. 

"Ready?" he asked. 

Winterbourne was too tired with some subtile weariness 
of nerve or spirit. He did not answer, but sat soaking in 
the quiet of the place. 

" Hunter 's there all the time,'' he volunteered. 

"At your house?" 

" I believe he likes it. He moves furniture and puts up 



 





curtains. They 're putting up curtains, Jim, over the whole 
damned place." 

"By George!" 

Lovell glanced about his own living-room and thought 
how clever be had been to abjure a curtain-breeding creature 
there. But Winterbourne, head raised, was looking at him 
as if he had in that instant made a discovery. 

" It isn't the curtains," he said. "I vow I believe it isn't 
the curtains." 

"What is it?" 

The pregnant " it " was, Lovell knew, his discontent at 
the general complexion life had suddenly assumed. 

"The curtains are well enough. I don't know but I 
think they soften the light a little. It 's what they stand 
for." 

He was going too fast now, for Lovell had not learned 
exactly what species of womankind the marauders were. 
He had even stayed out of the public streets as much as 
possible and taken to the spongy woods, because he was
