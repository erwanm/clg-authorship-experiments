of recognized defects. The main points of excellence, more or less
perfectly attained, may be stated to be a decent entrance examination
for all, a special, strict, and particular examination for some who
are to undertake technical duties, and a secure tenure of office. The
federal Act of 1886, which has since been amended in details, was not
arrived at without many experiments and the accumulation of testimonies
and diverse reports; and it did not follow exactly the majority report
of 1881, but leaned too much, in the judgment of many, to the English
system, the working of which has not been satisfactory. The main
features of the Act, omitting details, are these: The service has two
divisions—first, deputy heads of departments and employés in the Ottawa
departments; second, others than those employed in Ottawa departments,
including customs officials, inland revenue officials, post-office
inspectors, railway mail clerks, city postmasters, their assistants,
clerks, and carriers, and inspector of penitentiaries. A board of three
examiners is appointed by the Governor in council. All appointments
shall be “during pleasure,” and no persons shall be appointed or
promoted to any place below that of deputy head unless he has passed the
requisite examination and served the probationary term of six months;
he must not be over thirty-five years old for appointment in Ottawa
departments (this limit is not fixed for the “outside” appointments),
nor under fifteen in a lower grade than third-class clerk, nor under
eighteen in other cases. Appointees must be sound in health and of good
character. Women are not appointed. A deputy head may be removed “on
pleasure,” but the reasons for the removal must be laid before both
Houses of Parliament. Appointments may be made without reference to
age on the report of the deputy head, on account of technical or
professional qualifications or the public interest. City postmasters,
and such officers as inspectors and collectors, may be appointed without
examination or reference to the rules for promotion. Examinations are
dispensed with in other special cases. Removals may be made by the
Governor in council. Reports of all examinations and of the entire civil
service list must be laid before Parliament each session. Amendments
have been made to the law in the direction of relieving from examination
on their promotion men who have been long in the service, and an
amendment of last session omitted some examinations altogether.

It must be stated also that the service is not free from favoritism, and
that influence is used, if not always necessary, to get in and to get
on in it. The law has been gone around by means of the plea of “special
qualifications,” and this evasion has sometimes been considered a
political necessity on account of service to a minister or to the party
generally. I suppose that the party in power favors its own adherents.
The competitive system of England has a mischievous effect in the
encouragement of the examinations to direct studies towards a service
which nine in ten of the applicants will never reach. This evil, of
numbers qualified but not appointed, has grown so great in Canada that
it has lately been ordered that there shall be only one examination in
each year.

The federal pension system cannot be considered settled. A man may be
superannuated at any time, but by custom, not law, he retires at the
full age of sixty. While in service he pays a superannuation allowance
of two and a half per cent, on his salary for thirty-five years; after
that, no more. If he is superannuated after ten years’ service, say, he
gets one-fiftieth of his salary for each year. If he is not in fault in
any way, Government may add ten years more to his service, so as to give
him a larger allowance. If a man serves the full term of thirty-five
years he gets thirty-five fiftieths of his salary in pension. This
pension system, recognized as essential to a good civil service, has
this weakness: A man pays two and a half per cent, of his salary for
twenty years. If the salary is $3000, his payments would have amounted
to $1200, with interest, in that time. If he then dies, his widow gets
only two months’ salary as a solatium; all the rest is lost to her,
and goes to the superannuation fund of the treasury. Or, a man is
superannuated after thirty-five years; he has paid perhaps $2100, with
interest; he draws, say, one year’s superannuative allowance, and then
dies. His family get nothing at all, not even the two months’ salary
they would have had if he had died in service. This is illogical and
unjust. If the two and a half per cent, had been put into a life policy,
the insurance being undertaken by the Government, a decent sum would
have been realized at death.

A civil service is also established in the provinces. That in Quebec is
better organized than the federal; the Government adds to the pension
fund one-fourth of that retained from the salaries, and half pensions
are extended to widows and children.

It will be seen that this pension is an essential part of the civil
service system, and the method of it is at once a sort of insurance and
a stimulation to faithful service. Good service is a constant inducement
to retention, to promotion, and to increase of pension. The Canadians
say that the systems work well both in the federal and provincial
services, and in this respect, as well as in the matter of responsible
government, they think their government superior to ours.

The policy of the Dominion Government, when confederation had given
it the form and territory of a great nation, was to develop this into
reality and solidity by creating industries, building railways, and
filling up the country with settlers. As to the means of carrying out
this the two parties differed somewhat. The Conservatives favored active
stimulation to the extent of drawing on the future; the Liberals favored
what they call a more natural if a slower growth. To illustrate: the
Conservatives enacted a tariff, which was protective, to build up
industries, and it is now continued, as in their view a necessity
for raising the revenue needed for government expenses and for the
development of the country. The Liberals favored a low tariff, and
in the main the principles of free-trade. It might be impertinence
to attempt to say now whether the Canadian affiliations are with the
Democratic or the Republican party in the United States, but it is
historical to say that for the most part the Unionists had not the
sympathy of the Conservatives during our Civil War, and that they had
the sympathy of the Liberals generally, and that the sympathy of the
Liberals continued with the Republican party down to the Presidential
campaign of 1884. It seemed to the Conservatives a necessity for the
unity and growth of the Dominion to push railway construction. The
Liberals, if I understand their policy, opposed mortgaging the future,
and would rather let railways spring from local action and local
necessity throughout the Dominion. But whatever the policies of parties
may be, the Conservative Government has promoted by subsidies of money
and grants of land all the great so-called Dominion railways. The chief
of these in national importance, because it crosses the continent, is
the Canadian Pacific. In order that I might understand its relation
to the development of the country, and have some comprehension of the
extent of Canadian territory, I made the journey on this line—3000
miles—from Montreal to Vancouver.

The Canadians have contributed liberally to the promotion of railways.
The Hand-book of 1886 says that $187,000,000 have been given by the
governments (federal and provincial) and by the municipalities towards
the construction of the 13,000 miles of railways within the Dominion.
The same authority says that from 1881 to July, 1885, the Federal
Government gave $74,500,000 to the Canadian Pacific. The Conservatives
like to note that the railway development corresponds with the political
life of Sir John A. Macdonald, for upon his entrance upon political life
in 1844 there were only fourteen miles of railway in operation.

The Federal Government began surveys for the Canadian Pacific road in
1871, a company was chartered the same year to build it, but no results
followed. The Government then began the construction itself, and built
several disconnected sections. The present company was chartered in
1880. The Dominion Government granted it a subsidy of $25,000,000 and
25,000,000 acres of land, and transferred to it, free of cost, 713 miles
of railway which had been built by the Government, at a cost of
about $35,000,000. In November, 1885, considerably inside the time of
contract, the road was finished to the Pacific, and in 1886 cars were
running regularly its entire length. In point of time, and considering
the substantial character of the road, it is a marvellous achievement.
Subsequently, in order to obtain a line from Montreal to the maritime
ports, a subsidy of $186,000 per annum for a term of twenty years was
granted to the Atlantic and North-west Railway Company, which undertook
to build or acquire a line from Montreal via Sherbrooke, and across the
State of Maine to St. John, St. Andrews, and Halifax. This is one of the
leased lines of the Canadian Pacific, which finished it last December.

The main line, from Quebec to Montreal and Vancouver, is 3065 miles. The
leased lines measure 2412 miles, one under construction 112, making a
total mileage of 5589. Adding to this the lines in which the company’s
influence amounts to a control (including those on American soil to St.
Paul and Chicago), the total mileage of the company is over 6500. The
branch lines, built or acquired in Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba,
are all necessary feeders to the main line. The cost of the Canadian
Pacific, including the line built by the Government and acquired
(not leased) lines, is: Cost of road, $170,689,629.51; equipment,
$10,570,933.22; amount of deposit with Government to guarantee three
per cent, on capital stock until August 17, 1893, $10,310,954.75. Total,
$191,571,517.48.

Without going into the financial statement, nor appending the leases
and guarantees, any further than to note that the capital stock
