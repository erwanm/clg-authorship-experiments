or Boston, was widely, in its social life, separated from its sisters.
Indeed, in early days, before the slavery agitation, there was, owing
to the heritage of English traditions, more in common between Boston and
Charleston than between New Orleans and Charleston. And later, there was
a marked social difference between towns and cities near together—as,
for instance, between agricultural Lexington and commercial Louisville,
in Kentucky.

The historian who writes the social life of the Southern States will be
embarrassed with romantic and picturesque material. Nowhere else in
this levelling age will he find a community developing so much of the
dramatic, so much splendor and such pathetic contrasts in the highest
social cultivation, as in the plantation and city life of South
Carolina. Already, in regarding it, it assumes an air of unreality,
and vanishes in its strong lights and heavy shades like a dream of
the chivalric age. An allusion to its character is sufficient for the
purposes of this paper. Persons are still alive who saw the prodigal
style of living and the reckless hospitality of the planters in
those days, when in the Charleston and Sea Island mansions the guests
constantly entertained were only outnumbered by the swarms of servants;
when it was not incongruous and scarcely ostentatious that the courtly
company, which had the fine and free manner of another age, should dine
off gold and silver plate; and when all that wealth and luxury could
suggest was lavished in a princely magnificence that was almost barbaric
in its profusion. The young men were educated in England; the young
women were reared like helpless princesses, with a servant for every
want and whim; it was a day of elegant accomplishments and deferential
manners, but the men gamed like Fox and drank like Sheridan, and the
duel was the ordinary arbiter of any difference of opinion or of any
point of honor. Not even slavery itself could support existence on such
a scale, and even before the war it began to give way to the conditions
of our modern life. And now that old peculiar civilization of South.
Carolina belongs to romance. It can never be repeated, even by the aid
of such gigantic fortunes as are now accumulating in the North.

The agricultural life of Virginia appeals with scarcely less attraction
to the imagination of the novelist. Mr. Thackeray caught the flavor of
it in his “Virginians” from an actual study of it in the old houses,
when it was becoming a faded memory. The vast estates—principalities in
size—with troops of slaves attached to each plantation; the hospitality,
less costly, but as free as that of South Carolina; the land in the
hands of a few people; politics and society controlled by a small number
of historic families, intermarried until all Virginians of a certain
grade were related—all this forms a picture as feudal-like and foreign
to this age as can be imagined. The writer recently read the will of
a country gentleman of the last century in Virginia, which raises a
distinct image of the landed aristocracy of the time. It devised
his plantation of six thousand acres with its slaves attached, his
plantation of eighteen hundred acres and slaves, his plantation of
twelve hundred acres and slaves, with other farms and outlying property;
it mentioned all the cattle, sheep, and hogs, the riding-horses in
stables, the racing-steeds, the several coaches with the six horses that
drew them (an acknowledgment of the wretched state of the roads), and
so on in all the details of a vast domain. All the slaves are called
by name, all the farming implements were enumerated, and all the homely
articles of furniture down to the beds and kitchen utensils. This whole
structure of a unique civilization is practically swept away now, and
with it the peculiar social life it produced. Let us pause a moment
upon a few details of it, as it had its highest development in Eastern
Virginia.

The family was the fetich. In this high social caste the estates were
entailed to the limit of the law, for one generation, and this entail
was commonly religiously renewed by the heir. It was not expected that
a widow would remarry; as a rule she did not, and it was almost a matter
of course that the will of the husband should make the enjoyment of even
the entailed estate dependent upon the non-marriage of the widow. These
prohibitions upon her freedom of choice were not considered singular or
cruel in a society whose chief gospel was the preservation of the family
name.

The planters lived more simply than the great seaboard planters of South
Carolina and Georgia, with not less pride, but with less ostentation
and show. The houses were of the accepted colonial pattern, square, with
four rooms on a floor, but with wide galleries (wherein they differed
from the colonial houses in New England), and sometimes with additions
in the way of offices and lodging-rooms. The furniture was very simple
and plain—a few hundred dollars would cover the cost of it in most
mansions. There were not in all Virginia more than two or three
magnificent houses. It was the taste of gentlemen to adorn the ground
in front of the house with evergreens, with the locust and acanthus, and
perhaps the maple-trees not native to the spot; while the oak, which is
nowhere more stately and noble than in Virginia, was never seen on the
lawn or the drive-way, but might be found about the “quarters,” or in
an adjacent forest park. As the interior of the houses was plain, so the
taste of the people was simple in the matter of ornament—jewellery was
very little worn; in fact, it is almost literally true that there were
in Virginia no family jewels.

So thoroughly did this society believe in itself and keep to its
traditions that the young gentleman of the house, educated in England,
brought on his return nothing foreign home with him—no foreign tastes,
no bric-à-brac for his home, and never a foreign wife. He came back
unchanged, and married the cousin he met at the first country dance he
went to.

The pride of the people, which was intense, did not manifest itself in
ways that are common elsewhere—it was sufficient to itself in its own
homespun independence. What would make one distinguished elsewhere
was powerless here. Literary talent, and even acquired wealth, gave no
distinction; aside from family and membership of the caste, nothing
gave it to any native or visitor. There was no lion-hunting, no desire
whatever to attract the attention of, or to pay any deference to, men of
letters. If a member of society happened to be distinguished in letters
or in scholarship, it made not the slightest difference in his social
appreciation. There was absolutely no encouragement for men of letters,
and consequently there was no literary class and little literature.
There was only one thing that gave a man any distinction in this
society, except a long pedigree, and that was the talent of oratory—that
was prized, for that was connected with prestige in the State and the
politics of the dominant class. The planters took few newspapers, and
read those few very little. They were a fox-hunting, convivial race,
generally Whig in politics, always orthodox in religion. The man of
cultivation was rare, and, if he was cultivated, it was usually only on
a single subject. But the planter might be an astute politician, and
a man of wide knowledge and influence in public affairs. There was one
thing, however, that was held in almost equal value with pedigree, and
that was female beauty. There was always the recognized “belle,” the
beauty of the day, who was the toast and the theme of talk, whose memory
was always green with her chivalrous contemporaries; the veterans liked
to recall over the old Madeira the wit and charms of the raving beauties
who had long gone the way of the famous vintages of the cellar.

The position of the clergyman in the Episcopal Church was very much what
his position was in England in the time of James II. He was patronized
and paid like any other adjunct of a well-ordered society. If he did not
satisfy his masters he was quietly informed that he could probably
be more useful elsewhere. If he was acceptable, one element of his
popularity was that he rode to hounds and could tell a good story over
the wine at dinner.

The pride of this society preserved itself in a certain high, chivalrous
state. If any of its members were poor, as most of them became after the
war, they took a certain pride in their poverty. They were too proud to
enter into a vulgar struggle to be otherwise, and they were too old to
learn the habit of labor. No such thing was known in it as scandal.
If any breach of morals occurred, it was apt to be acknowledged with
a Spartan regard for truth, and defiantly published by the families
affected, who announced that they accepted the humiliation of it.
Scandal there should be none. In that caste the character of women was
not even to be the subject of talk in private gossip and innuendo. No
breach of social caste was possible. The overseer, for instance, and
the descendants of the overseer, however rich, or well educated, or
accomplished they might become, could never marry into the select
class. An alliance of this sort doomed the offender to an absolute and
permanent loss of social position. This was the rule. Beauty could no
more gain entrance there than wealth.

This plantation life, of which so much has been written, was repeated
with variations all over the South. In Louisiana and lower Mississippi
it was more prodigal than in Virginia. To a great extent its tone was
determined by a relaxing climate, and it must be confessed that it had
in it an element of the irresponsible—of the “after us the deluge.”
The whole system wanted thrift and, to an English or Northern
visitor, certain conditions of comfort. Yet everybody acknowledged its
fascination; for there was nowhere else such a display of open-hearted
hospitality. An invitation to visit meant an invitation to stay
indefinitely. The longer the visit lasted, if it ran into months,
the better were the entertainers pleased. It was an uncalculating
hospitality, and possibly it went along with littleness and meanness, in
