recitation, and forget it within an hour in 
the formation of solid habits of study. Mrs. 
McMunn was just what she looked to be, an 
awkward, good-natured, easy-going, and by no 
means scholarly woman. In fact, she owed her 
position to the reputation of a distinguished 
brother, rather than to any attainments or suit 
abilities for the work of a teacher which any 
body had ever been so fortunate as to discover 
in her. Miss Ayre was a severe disciplinarian, 
and Chaplain Goss a thorough mathematical 
instructor; but under-teachers cannot guide 


the helm. Mrs. McMunn was careless about 
enforcing their rules, and made herself no sys 
tem of marks, rewards, or punishments, to 
serve as incitement to the ambitious, or threat 
to the lazy; so it was small wonder that 
even Gypsy 's most violent efforts to become 
that " exemplary scholar " flagged after a 
day or two, and subsided into taffy and 
novels. 

But Jane 's did not Nor Lou Armstrong s. 
Nor the efforts of one or two others. Had 
Gypsy shown a little of the application of any 
one of them, she might have outstripped them 
all. She was simply spending her school-days 
as many another thoughtless, talented girl is 
spending them, the world over; neither better 
nor worse, " I won't be a dunce, but I can't 
be a model," just expressed it. 

But Gypsy was not, as she used to say for 
lornly sometimes to her mother, " just a 
jumble of naughtiness, without any goodness 
sprinkled in." Taking, for instance, a thing 
that happened soon after the beginning of the 



term; it was a very little thing, but not too 
small to be without its uses. 

It was one Sunday noon, just after church; 
several of the girls had come up into Gypsy 's 
room ; one or two with a headache or " the 
blues," hunting for Jane; the rest Gypsy 's 
friends. It chanced that they were all busy 
for a few moments about Jane, who was ex 
plaining the Bible lesson to them, and that 
Gypsy, turning away to the table to hunt for 
her Testament, came upon " The Shadow of a 
Life-time." It lay open where she had left it 
at eleven o'clock Saturday night. The lachry 
mose Lorina was in a thrilling crisis of her 
history ; tangled by her hair in a thorn-bush, I 
believe, or something of the sort, with two 
wild bulls, three robbers, and a rattlesnake 
funning after her if rattlesnakes may, with 
zoological propriety, be said to run. 

Gypsy took up the book, thinking that she 

would close it and put it on the shelf; turned 

the leaves a little, glanced up and down a page 

or two, looked at the next illustration, thought 



she would just see whether Adolphe did not 
come to the rescue, sat down and read for 
twenty minutes. 

Suddenly the girls heard a great noise. It 
was " The Shadow of a Life-time " flying across 
the room, and going crash ! against the wall. 

" You old thing ! " 

"Why, Gypsy Breynton! What old thing? 
The book?" 

" No, not the book." 

"Well, then; what is to pay?" 

" I 've been breaking the Sabbath, and I 'm 
ashamed of myself, and that 's what 's to pay ! " 
said Gypsy, with hot cheeks. One or two of 
the girls laughed. Nobody said anything for 
a minute, till Jo Courtis had recovered from her 
astonishment. 

"My stars! Why, I read Bleak House, 
all last Sunday, and The Woman in White 
all the Sunday before, and Harper stories Sun 
day before that, and why, when would you 
do your reading if you couldn t?" 

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, 


Courtis," said Maude Clare, with a virtuous 
look of reproof. " If I did such things, I 
wouldn't boast of them." 

"Miss Smith didn't carry her Euclid to 
church, and study behind her muff, all sermon 
time, I suppose? Oh, no!" said Jacqueline, 
with her inevitable effort to be sarcastic. 

"Well," said Maude Clare, sharply, but with 
brightened colour, "that is a different thing. 
Besides, it was a very unusual case ; I hadn't 
learned a solitary proposition, and if I go into 
recitation in that trim, Brother Ayre annihilates 
me." 

" I think it was just the same thing," pro 
nounced Gypsy, boldly, "we were all wrong; 
T was wrong, and Jo was wrong, and it was 
wrong in you, Maude, and there! I won't 
preach a sermon, but I believe it is our busi 
ness to keep the Sabbath holy." 

To say just that, before a crowded roomful, 
before Maude Clare 's vexed eyes, required - 
did it not, girls? some courage.
