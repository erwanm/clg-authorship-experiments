disagreeably wide, when any one wishes to cross to the opposite side.

Returning to the square, Dr. Winstock pointed down a street by the
steamboat landing, which extended along the west shore of the bay. The
driver understood him promptly, for this street led to the Botanical
Gardens, which is a popular place of resort for the people. It was
about a mile from the town, and on the arrival of the party a band was
playing in front of a large building which contained a very handsome
restaurant, sometimes used as a ball-room. The tourists entered this
place, and seated themselves at one of the tables.

"What's the use of coming in here, when we can't speak a word of the
lingo?" laughed Paul.

"I never go hungry for the want of language," replied the doctor, as a
very polite waiter presented himself.

"Do you speak English?" he added to this man.

The waiter shook his head.

"Do you speak French?" asked the doctor in this language.

The attendant shook his head again.

"Sprechen sie Deutsch?"

"Ya; ein wenig; nicht fiel," replied the man, a gleam of sunshine
lighting up his face, when the difficulty seemed to be solved.

But his knowledge of German was exceedingly limited, though after
several blunders he brought the lunch and coffee which the surgeon
ordered. The feast consisted of the same "snack" which is served in
Sweden--little fishes, thin slices of sausage, and of salmon, and the
inevitable sandwich of caviar, or fish spawn. As in Sweden, the
coffee was excellent; but none of the party had yet conquered their
repugnance to the slimy caviar. When they had about finished the
lunch, the attentive waiter appeared with half a dozen dishes of veal
cutlets.

"What have you there?" asked the surgeon.

"Kalbfleisch,"--which means veal,--replied the waiter.

"I did not order it."

"Ja, mein herr."

"No; I said kalt Fleisch," added the doctor; and Paul laughed
heartily, though this was only a specimen of the blunders the man made.

The surgeon had called for kalt Fleisch, or cold meat, and the first
word is not unlike Kalb.

"Rechnung," said Dr. Winstock, which means, "Bring me the bill;" as
the French say, "Addition," for the same thing, and the Austrians,
"Bezahlen."

The bill, which doubtless included the veal cutlets, was three marks,
or sixty cents, for each person--a foretaste of Russian prices, dearer
than in any other part of Europe. It was paid, and the party took a
walk through the gardens, extending down to the sea-shore. It is simply
a pleasant place, without being very attractive. A hill near the point
of the peninsula commands a fine view of Sveaborg and the Gulf. There
is an extensive bathing-house near the rocky shore. A trip among the
islands in the vicinity is very agreeable, and little steamers may
be chartered for such excursions at three rubles an hour. The party
returned to the town, and drove to the landing-place, where they were
fortunate enough to find Professor Badois, to act as interpreter in
paying the drosky fares; for however bland the drivers were in their
manners, they were evidently familiar with the tricks of their craft.

The several ship's companies went on board at once. The next morning
the squadron sailed for Wyborg, where she arrived after a day and a
night at sea, though the steamers make the trip in twelve hours.
Twelve versts from the town, the vessels passed into the harbor, which
is an extensive bay, through a narrow passage, on both sides of which
were vast piles of lumber, from which craft of all sizes and kinds
were loading. Off the town the squadron came to anchor, but no one was
permitted to go on shore until after the recitations in the afternoon.




CHAPTER VII.

WYBORG AND THE SECOND DEGREE.


"I should like to know what the name of this place is," said Lincoln
to Dr. Winstock, who was seated near him in the commodore's barge,
which was leading the line to the shore. "In one book it is Viborg; in
another, Wiborg; in a third, Wyborg." "The different spellings of the
same word simply indicate the attempts of authors to render the foreign
sounds into English," replied the surgeon. "We have the same variety
in many other words. On the English maps of Russia, you will find the
names of rivers, provinces, and towns given in many different ways;
as, Kief, Kiev, and Kiew, the latter being the German rendering of the
word; Nyzni, Nysni, Nezhnii, and a dozen other forms. Of course you can
take your choice. As for Wyborg, I think it will hardly pay to land,
for there is really nothing to be seen here. Like Constantinople, the
best view of the town is from the outside."

"It certainly looks well from the bay."

The students landed at the town, which is built on uneven ground. Most
of the streets are narrow and crooked, and the travellers soon realized
the truth of the surgeon's view. At the east side of the place is an
old castle in ruins. On a rock, rising from an arm of the sea, is a
lofty old tower, which has played its part in many a battle and siege,
for Wyborg was long a bone of contention between Sweden and Russia,
before the latter obtained possession, of it. Looking to the eastward
of the town, vast sheets of water may be seen, on which small steamers
ply, as at Stockholm, and a few miles distant are a garden and summer
resort for the people. A series of rivers and lakes connects Lakes
Ladoga and Saima, and a canal at Wyborg joins both of these great
sheets of water to the Gulf of Finland. Lakes Onega and Ladoga are
united by the River Svir, upon which plies a small steamer. The waters
of Lake Onega also mingle with those of the Volga. The Volkof River
flows from Lake Ilmen into Ladoga, and is navigable for barges; and
Lake Ilmen, by the help of a canal, is also connected with the Volga. A
boat may, therefore, start from the upper waters of the Finnish lakes,
and go through to the Caspian Sea.

A couple of hours in Wyborg fully satisfied the party, and they
returned to the boats for an excursion by water around the town. The
scenery in the vicinity is very pleasant, and at seven o'clock the
students landed at a green island.

"Now, fellows, we can attend to the second degree," said Scott, when he
had gathered some of the Bangwhangers around him, and found a retired
place.

The members of the fraternity knew each other so well, that there was
no difficulty in separating themselves from the rest of the ship's
company. The eight officers assembled near the shore, on a point of
land where there was a wooden shanty, that had evidently been used for
cleaning and curing fish, for a villainous smell came from it, which
was very trying to the olfactories of the members.

"How will this do?" asked Jones, as he opened the door of the shanty.

"First rate. We shall initiate the candidates into the mysteries of a
horrible odor at the same time," replied Scott, as the officers entered
the rude building.

"A fellow that has been to sea three months needn't mind this," laughed
Jones.

"All right; place the O. L. M. outside of the building, the I. L. M.
inside, near the door," said Scott, as he turned over a fish-tub for
his own throne as C. B., and placed it at one end of the building,
while Wainwright, the D. C. B., located himself at the other end.

"Officers, to your stations; proceed to open a lodge of Bangwhangers.
Y. D. K., on my right; Q. D., on my left; R. P. F. and L. P. F., on my
left. Brother D. C. B., are you a Bangwhanger?"

"Of course I am."
