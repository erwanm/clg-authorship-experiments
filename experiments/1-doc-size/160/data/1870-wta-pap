at the skylight, but the detective was not in sight upon the roof, and
though I called his name as loud as I dared to speak he did not respond.

I descended the stairs to the next floor, where I had understood the
room of the invalid was located. The door of his apartment was open,
and I discovered Mr. Gracewood in the act of ransacking his bed. He
was very nervous and excited, and I saw that the hand he was able to
use trembled violently.

  [Illustration: THE LOST MONEY. Page 281.]

"What is the matter, Mr. Gracewood?" I asked, as he continued to tumble
over the mattress and the pillows.

"All is lost!" exclaimed he, in the tones of despair.

"What is lost?"

"My money!" he gasped, in a hoarse whisper.

"Do you mean to say that it is gone!" I asked, startled at the
suggestion.

"All gone!" groaned he. "Twenty-four thousand dollars!"

"But where did you put it, sir?"

"Between the two beds, when Lynch sent for me to come up into his room."

"Did he send for you, sir?" I interposed.

"He did."

"Then it was a plot to rob you, sir."

"I fear that it was; but I was careless. I had hardly been out of my
room before; but when I did leave it, I took my money with me. I had
become accustomed to its possession, and I did not think of it. I did
not believe Lynch was a bad man. He was very kind to me, and attended
to my wants after I was hurt."

"Did he know you had this money?"

"I did not tell him, but I think he did. He must have stolen it."

"Don't be alarmed, sir. I don't think you will lose it," I added.

"It is gone already, and I shall never see it again."

"Perhaps you will, sir."

"No, never! The men in this house are all villains," said he, bitterly,
as he dropped into a chair, apparently from sheer exhaustion, and in
utter despair.

"No, sir; I happen to know that the eyes of a detective were upon him
at the very moment when he left the room above. I have no doubt he has
been arrested by this time."

"Detective?"

"Yes, sir;" and I gave a brief account of the manner in which Lynch had
swindled me, and stated the purpose for which I had returned to the
house.

"But I shall be exposed!" exclaimed Mr. Gracewood, bitterly. "I would
rather lose my money than have my wife and children know that I have
been gambling, and that I frequent such places as this. I wrote them
a miserable lie--that I was obliged to go to Memphis--to explain my
absence. If God will forgive and spare me this time, never will I be
guilty again!"

"Calm yourself, sir. I am sorry you have done wrong; but seeing and
repenting the wrong half undoes it--so your brother taught me."

"I shall never be at peace again in this world," groaned the sufferer.
"But let the money go; I can sell another estate, though a third of all
I had is gone already."

"The money is not gone, Mr. Gracewood. I am satisfied that Lynch is
arrested by this time."

"So much the worse! I shall be exposed."

"Perhaps not. Let us look the matter over. Why did Lynch send for you
to go up into his room?"

"He sent me a note by the young man who was with him. Here it is," he
added, rising and taking a piece of paper from the table.

I took the paper, which contained a few lines, as follows: "I have seen
the young fellow, Phil Farringford, who was with your brother. If you
will come up to my room, I will tell you what he says."

"You seem to have known about me before," I added, when I had read the
note.

"As I said, this Lynch took care of me when I was hurt. I did not
intend that any one here should know my name, but I think he read it
where the tailor had written it on the inside of my coat; at any rate,
he called me by name. I think he must have seen me take the package
of bank notes from my pocket and put it under the pillow, before the
surgeon came. When the doctor left, and I was more comfortable, he told
me that he had met my brother on board of a steamer up the Missouri,
and said there was a boy with him whom he had since seen in the city. I
was very anxious to know when my brother was coming, so that I might be
prepared to see him.

"Lynch did not know where my brother was, and I asked him if he
knew where to find you. He thought he should be able to see you,
and to-night I was very glad to learn that he had succeeded, and I
hastened up stairs to obtain the intelligence of the absent one."

The plan of the villain appeared to me to be past finding out. I
concluded that I had been sent for to assist in some manner in the
plundering of the unhappy gentleman. But they had done the job, so
far as I could see, without any help from me, unless my presence was
intended to lure the victim from his room, and thus enable them to do
the work. Why they had skirmished by robbing me of sixty-five dollars
was not at all clear to me. I explained to Mr. Gracewood that I had
left Mr. Rockwood and an officer outside of the house.

"I will go down and see if they are there now," I added. "Perhaps I
shall be able to tell you something about Lynch."

"Don't leave me, young man. I am miserable."

"But I want to know what has become of Lynch."

"No matter; let him go. Do not allow them to expose me."

I did not wonder that this man's conscience stung him, and that he
dreaded to have his name in the newspapers in connection with his
presence at the gambling-house. The only safety for men, young or old,
is to keep away from evil haunts. Those who enter gambling-houses from
curiosity may be impelled to repeat the visit from stronger motives.

While I was discussing the question with the miserable man, I heard
footsteps in the entry. I opened the door, and found Mr. Rockwood and
the detective, who had come to look for me.

"We have nabbed them both, Phil," said Mr. Rockwood. "They are in irons
at the next station-house. And a big haul it was, too."

"Whose room is that you came out of just now?" asked Mr. Bogart.

"It is occupied by a gentleman who is stopping here," I replied.

"Do you know what Lynch stole from that room?"

"I do--a package containing twenty-four thousand dollars. Did you see
him take it?"

"I did," answered Mr. Bogart. "But I don't understand this business."

"Neither do I."

"Where is the gentleman? I want to see him."

"I wouldn't see him to-night. He is quite sick, and suffering terribly."
