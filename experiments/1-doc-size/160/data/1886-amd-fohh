know what any one can do." 

He leads her to the sofa, and then seats himself beside 
her. The little hands are folded in her lap ; they look 
pearl-tipped on her black dress. There is such an ex- 
ceeding daintiness about her, that it invests her with 
a sort of sanctity. 

''Has any one threatened you? " There is an ominous 
look in his eye, as if it would not be best for the one who 
endeavored it. " You know I told you no one outside of 
yourself could break the will, or attempt it." 

" Could I be placed under any restraint? " she asks, in 
a soft breath ; but there is an unconf essed terror in her 
eyes, — the terror that has more than once to-day struck a 
chill to her very soul. 

'' You do not surely mean that anybody — " Then he 
laughs, — not exactly a mirthful sound, — rather contemp- 
tuous, indeed. 

"Could I be held as incapable of caring for my house 
or my child, or deciding what I should do ? " 

There is a little fine pride in her voice. 

''Not unless you should show some signs of mental 



 



 



 

aberration." He studies the sweet face that is raised 
for his examination. There is a peculiar strength in it, 
the latent strength that is forced to the surface when the 
hour of need comes, but can never show itself in any 
blatant force. She is one who should be taken care of 
and shielded in some strong man's love. Thorns will go 
deep into her tender soul. 

" No," he rejoins, decisively, after a moment's thought. 
" Do not allow yourself any uneasiness ; I am here to 
fight for you. I don't look like a man who can be easily 
overcome, do I ? " 

He laughs genially. He wants to break her tense mood, 
to restore something like girlish buoyancy, if, haply, it 
may not be quite crushed by her sorrows. 

" I should like to see your little babe," he begins, in a 
tone of friendly interest, — '' Lloyd Wentworth's son, who 
has such a fair heritage awaiting him." 

Doris sighs as she rings the bell and summons Marie. 
Master Lloyd has just awakened from his nap, and has 
the celestial rosiness of good-humored babies at this stage. 
He is indeed a very fair specimen of babyhood, consider- 
ing the many changes that have already come to him, and 
he always awakes in a maze of delight, if he does not go 
to sleep in one. Certainly he has not inherited this robust 
appearance from either parent ; though his father, the 
judge remembers, caused no anxiety until after his first 
long illness. The child has large brown eyes and a fine 
brow ; the rest of the features have the uncertainty of 
very early life ; but for a child not quite three months old, 
he is a sufficiently healthy specimen for hope to build 
upon ; and he praises him generously, as the baby stares 
with wondering eyes. 

" Do you think your relatives would grant me an inter- 
view?" he asks, when the baby has ended his visit. ''I 
am sorry they chanced to fall into the hands of Mr. 
Matthewson, and it seems as if we might come to an 



 



 



 

anderstanding on so simple a matter. They can do 
nothing, so long as you are satisfied ; I doubt if much 
could be done in any event." 

Doris prefers to summon them herself, and taps lightly 
at their door, explaining her errand. 

Anson Gilbert looks up contemptuously. 

" I shall see him on my own account and at my own 
convenience," he answers, with what he intends for severe 
dignity. 

Doris glances inquiringly at her aunt. 

" I surely haven't anything to say to your Judge Min- 
turn," is her lofty answer. 

" I shall offer the will for probaJ;e to-morrow," that 
gentleman says, as he rises to depart. " Basil Went- 
worth has been away, or I should have done it before. 
He, of course, has some interest in it." 

" Can you keep him as guardian for the baby?" she 
inquires, timidly. 

" Well, I shall make a big effort in that direction. You 
must not mind if the Wentworths are a little distant at 
first. It is a great change for them. I have set my heart 
on it all coming out right in the end." And there is 
strength and encouragement in his tone. 

" Oh, I hope it will ! I hope it will ! " Doris Went- 
worth replies, in a manner that is really impassioned. 

''You will come to me with every little trouble," he 
continues, confidently. " You have no brother or father, 
and you are so young to have this great weight on your 
shoulders." 

She looks up at him through tears, and her little hands 
have a clinging clasp. She is too timid and too sore at 
heart to know how important this, her first victory really 
is, but it is so good to have one friend. 

For the rest, the day is very quiet. The Gilberts make 
her feel as if she was indeed a thankless being, but her 
sense of right upholds her. She can see their side, unjust 



 



 



 

as it is ; she can also understand the Wentworth view ; 
and theirs, she feels, has more claim to sympathy. 

Yet it must be confessed, as Doris wanders about the
