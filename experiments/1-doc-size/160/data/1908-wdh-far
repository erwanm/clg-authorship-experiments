His impulse really had failed him. It had been to 
tell Miss Macroyd about his adventure and frankly 
trust her with it. He had liked her at several former 
meetings rather increasingly, because she had seemed 
open and honest beyond the most of women, but her pig- 
gish behavior at the station had been rather too open and 
honest, and the sense of this now opportunely inter- 
vened between him and the folly he was about to com- 
mit. Besides, he had no right to give Miss Shirley's 
part in his adventure away, and, since the affair was 
more vitally hers than his, to take it at all out of her 
hands. The early - falling dusk had favored an un- 
noticed advent for them, and there were other chances 
that had helped keep unknown their arrival together at 
Mrs. Westangle's in that squalid carryall, such as 
Miss Shirley's having managed instantly to slip in-doors 
before the man came out for Verrian's suit-case, and of 
her having got to her own appointed place long before 
there was any descent of the company to the after- 
noon tea. 

It was not for him now to undo all that and begin 
the laughing at the affair, which she had pathetically 
intimated that she would rather some one else should 
begin. He recoiled from his imprudence with a shock, 
but he had the pleasure of having mystified Miss 
Macroyd. He felt dismissal in the roving eye which 
she cast from him round the room, and he willingly 
let another young man replace him at her side. 

 

Yet he was not altogether satisfied. A certain meaner 
self that there was in him was not pleased with his 
relegation even merely in his own consciousness to the 
championship of a girl who was going to make her 
living in a sort of menial way. It had better be owned 
for him that, in his visions of literary glory, he had 
figured in social triumphs which, though vague, were 
resplendent with the glitter of smart circles. He had 
been so ignorant of such circles as to suppose they would 
have some use for him as a brilliant young author; 
and though he was outwearing this illusion, he still 
would not have liked a girl like Julia Macroyd, whose 
family, if not smart, was at least chic, to know that he 
had come to the house with a professional mistress of 
the revels, until Miss Shirley should have approved 
herself chic, too. The notion of such an employment as 
hers was in itself chic, but the girl was merely a paid 
part of the entertainment, as yet, and had not risen 
above the hireling status. If she had sunk to that level 
from a higher rank it would be all right, but there was 
no evidence that she had ever been smart. Verrian 
would, therefore, rather not be mixed up with her â€” at 
any rate, in the imagination of a girl like Julia Mac- 
royd; and as he left her side he drew a long breath of 
relief and went and put down his teacup where he had 
got it. 

By this time the girl who was " pouring " had ex- 
hausted one of the two original guards on whom she had 
been dividing her vision, and Verrian made a pre- 
tence, which she favored, that he had come up to push 
the man away. The man gracefully submitted to be 
dislodged, and Verrian remained in the enjoyment 
of one of the girl's distorted eyes till, yet another man 
coming up, she abruptly got rid of Verrian by pre- 
senting him to yet another girl. In such manoeuvres 

 

the hour of afternoon tea will pass ; and the time really 
wore on till it was time to dress for dinner. 

By the time that the guests came down to dinner they 
were all able to participate in the exchange of the 
discovery which each had made, that it was snowing out- 
doors, and they kept this going till one girl had the 
good-luck to say, " I don't see anything so astonishing 
in that at this time of year. Now, if it was snowing in- 
doors, it would be different." 

This relieved the tension in a general laugh, and a 
young man tried to contribute further to the gayety 
by declaring that it would not be surprising to have it 
snow in-doors. He had once seen the thing done in 
a crowded hall, one night, when somebody put up a 
window, and the freezing current of air congealed the 
respiration of the crowd, which came down in a light 
fall of snow-flakes. He owned that it was in Boston. 

" Oh, that excuses it, then," Miss Macroyd said. But 
she lost the laugh which was her due in the rush which 
some of the others made to open a window and see 
whether it could be made to snow in-doors there. 

" Oh, it isn't crowded enough here," the young man 
explained who had alleged the scientific marvel. 

" And it isn't Boston," Miss Macroyd tried again on 
the same string, and this time she got her laugh. 

The girl who had first spoken remained, at the risk 
of pneumonia, with her arm prettily lifted against the 
open sash, for a moment peering out, and then reported, 
in dashing it down with a shiver, " It seems to be a 
very soft snow." 

" Then it will be rain by morning," another pre- 
dicted, and the girl tried hard to think of something 
to say in support of the hit she had made already. But 
she could not, and was silent almost through the whole 
first course at dinner. 



In spite of its being a soft snow, it continued to fall 
as snow and not as rain. It lent the charm of stormy 
cold without to the brightness and warmth within. 
Much later, when between waltzes some of the dancers 
went out on the verandas for a breath of air, they came 
back reporting that the wind was rising and the snow 
was drifting. 

Upon the whole, the snow was a great success, and her 
guests congratulated Mrs. Westangle on having thought 
to have it. The felicitations included recognition of the 
originality of her whole scheme. She had downed the 
hoary superstition that people had too much of a good 
time on Christmas to want any good time at all in the 
week following ; and in acting upon the well-known fact 
that you never wanted a holiday so much as the day 
after you had one, she had made a movement of the 
highest social importance. These were the ideas which 
Verrian and the young man of the in-doors snow-storm 
urged upon her; his name was Bushwick, and he and 
Verrian found that they were very good-fellows after 
they had rather supposed the contrary. 

Mrs. Westangle received their ideas with the twit- 
tering reticence that deceived so many people when they 
supposed she knew what they were talking about.

At breakfast, where the guests were reasonably 
punctual, they were all able to observe, in the rapid 
succession in which they descended from their rooms, 
that it had stopped snowing and the sun was shining 
brilliantly. 

" There isn't enough for sleighing," Mrs. Westangle 
proclaimed from the head of the table in her high twit- 
ter, " and there isn't any coasting here in this flat coun-
