Blood, " he said gravely, "that you pay me a very 
high compliment ? " 

" How ? " she asked. 

" You rate my maximum as my mean tempera- 
ture." He felt that she listened inquiringly. " I 
don't think I 'm habitually up to a thing of that 
kind," he explained. 

" Oh, no," she assented, quietly ; " but when he 
struck at you so, you had to do everything." 

" Ah, you have the pitiless Puritan conscience 
that takes the life out of us all ! " cried Staniford, 
with sudden bitterness. Lydia seemed startled, 
shocked, and her hand trembled on his arm, as if 
she had a mind to take it away. " I was a long 
time laboring up to that point. I suppose you are 
always there ! " 

" I don't understand," she said, turning her head 
round with the slow motion of her beauty, and look- 
ing him full in the face. 

" I can't explain now. I will, by and by, — when 
we get to Venice," he added, with quick lightness. 

" You put off everything till we get to Venice," 
she said, doubtfully. 

" I beg your pardon. It was you who did it the 
last time." 

" Was it ? " She laughed. " So it was ! I was 
thinking it was you." 

It consoled him a little that she should have con- 
fused them in her thought, in this way. " What 
was it you were to tell me in Venice? " he asked. 



 

" I can't think, now." 

" Very likely something of yourself — or myself. 
A third person might say our conversational range 
was limited." 

" Do you think it is very egotistical ? " she asked, 
in the gay tone which gave him relief from the 
sense of oppressive elevation of mind in her. 

" It is in me, — not in you." 

" But I don't see the difference." 

" I will explain sometime." 

" When we get to Venice ? " 

They both laughed. It was very nonsensical ; 
but nonsense is sometimes enough. 

When they were serious again, " Tell me," he 
said, " what you thought of that lady in Messina, 
the other day." 

She did not affect not to know whom he meant. 
She merely said, " I only saw her a moment." 

u But you thought something. If we onty see 
people a second we form some opinion of them." 

" She is very fine-appearing," said Lydia. 

Staniford smiled at the countrified phrase ; he 
had observed that when she spoke her mind she 
used an instinctive good language ; when she would 
not speak it, she fell into the phraseology of the 
people with whom she had lived. " I see you don't 
wish to say, because you think she is a friend of 
mine. But you can speak out freely. We were 
not friends ; we were enemies, if anything." 

Staniford's meaning was clear enough to himself ; 



 

but Lydia paused, as if in doubt whether he was 
jesting or not, before she asked, " Why were you 
riding with her then ? " 

" I was driving with her," he replied, " I suppose, 
because she asked me." 

" Asked you ! " cried the girl ; and he perceived 
her moral recoil both from himself and from a 
woman who could be so unseemly. That lady 
would have found it delicious if she could have 
known that a girl placed like Lydia was shocked at 
her behavior. But he was not amused. He was 
touched by the simple self-respect that would not 
let her suffer from what was not wrong in itself, 
but that made her shrink from a voluntary sem- 
blance of unwomanliness. It endeared her not only 
to his pity, but to that sense which in every man 
consecrates womanhood, and waits for some woman 
to be better than all her sex. Again he felt the 
pang he had remotely known before. What would 
she do with these ideals of hers in that depraved 
Old World, — so long past trouble for its sins as to 
have got a sort of sweetness and innocence in them, 
— where her facts would be utterly irreconcilable 
with her ideals, and equally incomprehensible ? 

They walked up and down a few turns without 
speaking again of that lady. He knew that she 
grew momently more constrained toward him ; that 
the pleasure of the time was spoiled for her ; that 
she had lost her trust in him ; and this half amused, 
half afflicted him. It did not surprise him when, 



 

at their third approach to the cabin gangway, she 
withdrew her hand from his arm and said, stiffly, 
" I think I will go down.' But she did not go at 
once. She lingered, and after a certain hesitation 
she said, without looking at him, " I didn 't ex- 
press what I wanted to, about Mr. Hicks, and — 
what you did. It is what I thought you would do." 
" Thanks," said Staniford, with sincere humility. 
He understood how she had had this in her mind, 
and how she would not withhold justice from him 
because he had fallen in her esteem ; how rather 
she would be the more resolute to do him justice 
for that reason.

He could see that she avoided being alone with 
him the next day, but he took it for a sign of re- 
lenting, perhaps helpless relenting, that she was in 
her usual place on deck in the evening. He went 
to her, and, " I see that you haven 't forgiven me," 
he said. 

" Forgiven you ? " she echoed. 

" Yes," he said, " for letting that lady ask me 
to drive with her."
