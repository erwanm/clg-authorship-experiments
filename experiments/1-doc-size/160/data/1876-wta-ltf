to punish a second one with me, and we separated. I went home with
my shares in my pocket. When the fumes of the champagne passed off, I
was uneasy again. I felt that I stood upon the brink of a precipice.
If Bustumups went down instead of going up, I was ruined. There was no
possible way for me to redeem myself.

Though my uncle knew I was dealing in stocks—or rather took my word
for it—and was plunging into a sea of speculation, he did not warn me
against it. He had not a word of caution to utter, and probably had no
suspicion that I might be tempted to meddle with the funds of the bank.
If he had been as solicitous as he pretended to be for my welfare, he
would have warned me of the perils of my course. For my own part, my
uncle was a mystery to me.

Lilian with the black silk in prospect, was as happy as a queen. In the
evening Tom Flynn called. He was hardly seated before Mrs. Oliphant
and Bertha made us a call. “Dear ma” appeared to be cured of her evil
propensity, probably because another daughter, through my indirect
agency, was in a fair way of being disposed of. We had sacred music,
and a lively time generally. I was quite satisfied that Tom would, at
no distant day, make my wife’s sister his bride. This prospect was
quite enough to appease Mrs. Oliphant, and she really looked quite
amiable under the indications of this happy event.

Tom escorted Bertha and her mother home at ten o’clock, and the next
day the noble fellow told me with a blush, that he did not leave the
house on Tremont Street till the clock struck twelve. A question or two
from me brought out the fact that they were engaged. I envied Tom—he
was so happy. Why should he not be? He owed the bank nothing. He had
not soiled his soul by taking what did not belong to him. He was a
strictly moral and religious young man. He would have gone without his
dinner rather than stay away from the evening prayer-meeting. I say I
envied him. I did; and I would have given all the world, had it been
mine to give, for his peace of mind.

I could not sleep that night when I went to bed. I got up and drank
nearly half a bottle of Smith’s old sherry, which stupefied my brain,
and gave me the needed rest from the goadings of conscience and the
terrors of the future. My fate depended upon the success of the
Bustumup Company. If that went down, I might be called at any time to
flee from my wife, and wander in fear and trembling as an exile in
some strange land. If I was in peril of exposure I could not remain to
face the blast of popular condemnation. My pride would not permit me to
live where any man could look down upon me with either pity or contempt.

At twelve o’clock, when I run out for a lunch, I found that Bustumups
were quoted at twenty-five. This fact assured me, for already I had
practically paid off more than one-third of my debt. The stock went a
little higher before two o’clock, and my courage was correspondingly
increased. I was rather disturbed, however, at the close of the bank,
to see my uncle in close conversation with Mr. Bristlebach. I fancied
that I was the subject of their remarks, especially as the president
cast frequent glances at me. Captain Halliard looked ugly.

I had shown him a portion of the certificates which Cormorin had lent
me. He was a shrewd business man, and though he had not objected to
the statement that I had saved half my salary, and invested it in
stocks, he might well have doubted the truth of it. Perhaps he had
been thinking over my affairs, and had come to the conclusion that my
assertions were doubtful. On two occasions he had driven me up to the
payment of money, and both times I had met the demand.

Cormorin told me that he always ascertained when the directors intended
to make an examination. Captain Halliard meant mischief. He intended,
at least, to put me in condition to let Aunt Rachel alone. I am
confident he did not really believe that I had borrowed any thing of
the bank; but probably he wanted to satisfy himself that I did not
obtain my ready money from the drawer. As the conversation continued
I became alarmed. The President almost invariably left the bank soon
after two o’clock. To-day he remained. As he had done once before since
I occupied my position, he might examine the condition of the cash
department.

I meant to be on the sure side. I ran into the bank where Cormorin was,
and told him what I suspected. He promptly offered to help me out, on
the same terms that I had performed a similar service for him.

“I want eight thousand,” I whispered. “I will return it to-morrow
morning.”

“Eight thousand!” exclaimed he. “Why, you are only five thousand
short.”

“Eight,” I replied, firmly.

“How’s that?”

“I was three thousand short when I made the little arrangement.”

“Thunder!” ejaculated he, impatiently. “Then you are the eagle and I am
the lamb.”

“We are both honest fellows, and mean to pay all we owe,” I replied.
“Do you suppose I would have accommodated you, the other day, if I had
not been in hot water myself? Of course if I go down, you go with me.”

“But the security?” he asked.

“Two hundred and fifty shares of Bustumups.”

“They are worth only six thousand or so.”

“But will be worth more than eight in a few days; you shall have your
bills back to-morrow morning, without fail.”

I gave him my certificates and he handed me the money; but he gnashed
his teeth as he did so. If I fell, I should drag him down with me.

“Is everything right in your drawer?” asked Heavyside, the cashier,
slyly, of me, when I returned.

“Certainly it is,” I replied. “Why do you ask?”

“Bristlebach is going to look over our accounts and cash this
afternoon.”

“All right,” I answered, carelessly.

I deposited the eight thousand in my drawer, balanced my cash, and put
the trunk into the safe. Paying no attention to any one, and especially
not to my uncle, I sauntered leisurely out of the bank.




CHAPTER XVIII.

BUSTUMUPS AT FIFTY.


BY the ruse in which Cormorin had instructed me, and for which he had
furnished the funds, I had provided against any exposure. By this time
I was fully satisfied that my uncle was working against me; not that he
intended to ruin me, but only to maintain his own power and influence
over me. There are men of this stamp in the world, who will punish
their best friends when they refuse to be guided by them. Captain
Halliard was as jealous of his influence as he was of his money.

As my account with the bank was now square, I had no fear of the
investigation which was in progress. Mr. Heavyside, who had never been
suspected of even an irregularity, had been so kind as to inform me of
the proposed examination. I had in him a good friend, and a mortgage on
his future fidelity to me. I should defeat my uncle this time, as I had
before, but it was annoying to be subjected to his espionage, though I
could not afford to have a serious quarrel with him.

I went home at about the usual hour. My Bustumups had done so well
that I was tolerably light-hearted. Lilian was as joyous as a dream
in June. Bertha had been with her all the forenoon, and I heard much
in praise of Tom Flynn. We dined, and then I proposed to Lilian that
we should ride out into the country. She was glad to go, and we went.
On my return home at six o’clock, Biddy handed me a note from Mr.
Bristlebach. I recognized his heavy hand-writing, and my blood ceased
to flow in its channels. I tore open the envelope. It was simply a
request to appear at the bank immediately.

What could it mean? My cash was all right. They could not have
discovered the truth. That was simply impossible. If there was any
trouble at the present time, Cormorin, and not myself, would be the
sufferer. If there had been a discovery of the whole truth, Mr.
