time a spark of personal vanity had ever inflamed her mind. She knew
that she was admired; she believed, because she amused people by her
sprightly repartee; compliments upon her appearance were forgotten
as soon as heard, leaving, as their only trace, contempt for their
author. To-night, the thoughtful eyes were alive with light; the
cheeks, usually colorless, as rosy as Carry's; and the wreathing
smile imparted a wondrous beauty to the proud lips. A softer, sweeter
happiness succeeded the girlish exultation--pardonable since it was
short-lived--she turned from the mirror, with indifference, as she
murmured--

  "Young, loving and beloved!
  These are brief words, but--"

An exclamation interrupted the quotation. She snatched up a letter
from the table. "It must have come this afternoon, and they forgot
to give it me. How unkind!" This was too public a place, there was
constant passing in and out; but she could not be debarred its perusal
until the guests' departure. A closet opened beyond the chamber; she
carried a lamp in thither, and bolted the door. He wrote kindly, but
more constrainedly than formerly; and the sense of some phrases was
confused, as if he had commenced them, meaning to say one thing, and
changed his mind ere the conclusion. His sister had been very ill, he
said, but was now out of danger; and his statement of this simple fact
appeared embarrassed. She read two pages in perplexity whether to chide
his ambiguity, or her unsettled thoughts; "And now, my dear friend," so
ran the third, "I have to solicit indulgence for my egotism, while I
speak of an event of incomparable importance--and than which, nothing
was more remote from my thoughts, four months ago. Annie has another
nurse besides myself this summer; an early playmate of ours, a gentle
girl, who, I think, must resemble your friend Carry, in character and
person. She visited Annie early in April; and an angel of healing she
has proved to our beloved sufferer. It is an affecting sight--one
so young and fair, deserting the society she would adorn, for the
wearisome offices of a sick-room. I have said that she is gentle, and
in disposition and deportment essentially feminine;--add to these, the
intelligence and accomplishments of a strong and thoroughly-trained
mind; and you will not be surprised that she has gained our
hearts;--will not accuse me of precipitancy, when you hear that I have
sought and obtained her promise to return to us, united by a dearer tie
than the bonds of friendship. I do not merit this gift at the hands of
Providence; for I have rebelled, in times past, at the strokes I knew
were just, but could not acknowledge were merciful. There is nothing
earthly which can compare with the love of a true-hearted woman.--If I
ever needed an incentive to industry I have it in this. Months--years,
perhaps--must elapse before our union. It may be said, I have not acted
prudently in forming an engagement, whose consummation is so distant;
but I have obeyed the voice of my heart and conscience."

Aye! crumple the sheet in your grasp, and sink to the earth--a crushed
thing! struck down from the zenith of your pride and bliss--crushed
and mangled--but living and feeling! Grief does not always stun--it
seldom kills--you must live, although each lacerated heart-string is
crying out for death! Say not that it came without warning! Was there
no voice in your early bereavement--in the stern lessons of your
girlhood--in the frustration of an hundred cherished purposes--in
Lynn's suicidal madness--in Ellen's remorse--in Charley's withered
heart? Why were you made to feel, see, know these, if not to teach
you, that they who lean upon mortal's love trust to the weakest of
rotten reeds--they "who sow the wind, must reap the whirl wind"--black,
bitter, scorching!




CHAPTER XX.


"I never thought you unreasonable before, Ida."

"I am sorry you should now, Carry."

"How can I help it, when after travelling with us for weeks you
suddenly resolve to return to Eastern Virginia by yourself; and to that
lonesome place in the country, which you have not visited for years!"

"I have an escort; a gentleman who is on his way to Richmond, and will
take charge of me."

"But why this notion, just as we decided to go north? Has your
curiosity to behold Niagara diminished since your sight of 'the
Bridge?'"

"Frankly and truly, I do not care to see it. I would not ride to the
House Mountain yonder, if Mont Blanc, the Lake of Como, and the Great
Fall were to be seen from the other side."

"Do you hear that, Arthur?" said Carry, despairingly, to her husband,
who was reading.

"No--what is it?"

"This obstinate young lady is about to deprive us of the honour of her
company. She is going back to Staunton to-morrow."

"To the Lunatic Hospital?" inquired Arthur, putting aside his book.
"You are not in earnest, Ida? Are you tired of us; or do you dislike
our sketched route? If the last, we will alter it."

"And if the first, we will alter ourselves," interposed Carry,
laughingly.

"I would have you and your plans remain as they are. I am not well,
and require rest--not change. My desire to see old Sunnybank is not a
caprice, as Carry supposes; I have had it in contemplation for a long
time. Mr. Read deterred me from it by representations of the discomfort
I would encounter; the only white man left on the plantation being the
overseer. This summer he has been removed, and his place given to a
former tenant of mother's; a man of family; and the accommodations,
which serve for them, will keep me from hardship."

"She is sick," said Carry, when Ida retired. "She has not been herself
lately. Were it not that she is used to dissipation, I should think
that the round of parties, after our wedding, overtasked her strength.
Yet, she enjoyed them."

"Her malady may be of the mind," said Dr. Dana, thoughtfully. "Do you
consider this probable?"

"Oh, no! she was well and happy when she came to us; and what can have
occurred since to affect her?"

"You are right, I dare say;" returned he, absently. He was pondering
upon her behaviour after Charley's departure.

Argument did not dissuade, and conjecture was baffled in the effort
to explain this unexpected movement. They parted in Lexington--Ida
to recross the mountains eastward; they, to travel north by way of
Harper's Ferry.

If there is an enjoyment, which is purely of the intellect, its
usurpation is man's high prerogative; the sticklers for woman's "equal
rights" will never establish her title to it. The mind masculine may
be nourished and exercised, and attain its full size, while the heart
is dwarfed and sickly;--as with twin children, one sometimes grows to
man's stature, healthy and strong; and the other pines and dies in
childhood. In woman, intellect and the affections are united from their
birth;--like the Siamese brothers, one refuses food, which is denied
its companion; and who dare peril the life of both by severing the
ligament which joins them?

Ida's route was through the garden-spot of our State--the magnificent
Valley, with its heaven-bathed, impregnable eyries, among which
our country's Father selected a resting-place for Freedom's
standard--America's Thermopylae, should the invader's power drive him
from every other hold;--where one may travel for days, encircled by
the Briarean arms, the sister ridges stretch, in amity, towards each
other--each rolling its streams and clouds down to the verdant plains
between;--where morning and evening, the sun marshals his crimson and
gold-colored array upon the purple heights, which are coeval with
him and Time; and flings shadows and hues athwart them, in his day's
march, he never vouchsafes to Lowland countries;--and this region
was traversed with not a thought beyond a feverish wish to be at her
journey's end and rest. She stopped in Richmond but one night. Mr. Read
and his daughter were out of town, and she went to a hotel. At dawn
she was upon the road, with no attendant but the driver of her hack.
Rachel had gone to Sunnybank a month before, to see her relations,
little expecting her mistress to come for her. Ida's spirits and health
declined alarmingly, now that the necessity of eluding suspicion was
over. She had never been sick a day in her life; but she began to feel
