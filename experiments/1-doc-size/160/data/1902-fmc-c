stamp on any of them! How could that be? He used to write them on half
sheets of very thick note paper, and I never gave him any stamps."

"He probably had some in his pocket-book," said Monsieur Leroy. "At all
events, they are there."

"So much the better. But it is very strange that I should never have
noticed them."

Like many of those singular beings whom we commonly call "mediums,"
Monsieur Leroy was a degenerate in mind and body, and his character was
a compound of malign astuteness, blundering vanity, and hysterical
sensitiveness, all directed by impulses which he did not try to
understand. Without the Princess's protection through life, he must have
come to unutterable grief more than once. But she had always excused his
mistakes, made apologies for him, and taken infinite pains to make him
appear in the best light to her friends. He naturally attributed her
solicitude to the value she set upon his devotion to herself, since
there could be no other reason for it. Doubtless a charitable impulse
had at first impelled her to take in the starving baby that had been
found on the doorstep of an inn in the south of France. That was all he
knew of his origin. But he knew enough of her character to be sure that
if he had not shown some exceptional gifts at an early age, he would
soon have been handed over to servants or peasants to be taken care of,
and would have been altogether forgotten before long. Instead, he had
been spoiled, sent to the best schools, educated as a gentleman, treated
as an equal, and protected like a son. The Princess had given him money
to spend though she was miserly, and had not checked his fancies in his
early youth. She had even tried to marry him to the daughter of a rich
manufacturer, but had discovered that it is not easy to marry a young
gentleman who has no certificate of birth at all, and whose certificate
of baptism describes him as of unknown parents. On one point only she
had been inexorable. When she did not wish him to dine with her or to
appear in the evening, she insisted that he should stay away. Once or
twice he had attempted to disobey these formal orders, but he had
regretted it, for he had found himself face to face with one of the most
merciless human beings in existence, and his own character was far from
strong. He had therefore submitted altogether to the rule, well
satisfied with the power he had over her in most other respects, but he
felt that he must not lose it. The Princess was old and was growing
daily more capricious. She had left him a handsome competence in her
will, as much, indeed, as most bachelors would consider a fortune, but
she was not dead yet, and she might change her mind at the last moment.
He trembled to think what his end must be if she should die and leave
him penniless to face the world alone at his age, without a profession
and without real friends. For no one liked him, though some people
feared his tongue, and he knew it. Perhaps Guido would take pity on him
and give him shelter, for Guido was charitable, but the thought was not
pleasant. Never having been hungry since he could remember, Monsieur
Leroy thought starvation would be preferable to eating Guido d'Este's
bread. There was certainly no one else who would throw him a crust, and
though he had received a good deal of money from the Princess, and had
managed to take a good deal more from her, he had never succeeded in
keeping any of it.

It was necessary to form some plan at once for extracting money by means
of Guido's receipts, since the marriage was not to take place, and as
Monsieur Leroy altogether failed to hit upon any satisfactory scheme he
consulted a lawyer in confidence, and asked what could be done to
recover the value. The lawyer was a man of doubtful reputation but of
incontestable skill, and after considering the matter in all its
bearings he gave his client some slight hope of success, proportionate
to the amount of money Guido could raise by the sale of his effects and
by borrowing from his many friends. He was glad to learn that Guido had
never borrowed, except, as Monsieur Leroy explained, from his aunt. A
man in such a position could raise a round sum if suddenly driven to
extremities to save his honour.

The lawyer also asked Monsieur Leroy for details concerning Guido's life
during the last four or five years, inquiring very particularly about
his social relations and as to his having ever been in love with a woman
of his own rank, or with one of inferior station. Monsieur Leroy
answered all these questions with a conscientious desire to speak the
truth, which was new to him, for he realised that only the truth could
be of use in such a case, and that the slightest unfounded invention of
his own against Guido's character must mislead the man he was
consulting. In this he showed himself wiser than he often was.

"Above all," the lawyer concluded, "never mention my name to any one,
and try to appear surprised at anything unexpected which you may hear
about Signor d'Este."

Monsieur Leroy promised readily enough, though reticence was not his
strong point, and he went away well pleased with himself, after signing
a little paper by which it was agreed that the lawyer should receive
twenty per cent of any sums obtained from Guido through him. He had not
omitted to inform his adviser of the celebrated Doctor Baumgarten's
favourable opinion on the Andrea del Sarto and the small Raphael. The
lawyer told him not to be impatient, as affairs of this sort required
the utmost discretion.

But the man saw that he had a good chance of being engaged in one of
those cases that make an unnecessary amount of noise and are therefore
excellent advertisements for a comparatively unknown practitioner who
has more wit than scruples. He did not believe that all of Guido's many
high and mighty relations would take the side of Princess Anatolie, and
if any of them took the trouble to defend her nephew against her, the
newspapers would be full of the case and his own name would be famous in
a day.




                              CHAPTER XXII


Cecilia told her mother what Lamberti had advised her to do for Guido's
sake, and that she had sent her message by him. The Countess was
surprised and did not quite like the plan.

"Either you love him, or you do not, my dear," she said. "You were sure
that you did not, and you told him so. That was sensible, at least,
though I think you might have found out earlier what you felt. It is
much better to let him understand at once that you will not marry him.
Men would always rather know the truth at once and get over it than be
kept dangling at a capricious woman's beck and call."

Cecilia did not explain that Lamberti feared for his friend's life. In
broad daylight that looked dramatic, and her mother would not believe
it. She only said that she was sure she was acting for the best and that
the engagement was to stand a little longer, adding that she wished to
leave Rome, as it was very hot. In her heart she was hurt at being
called capricious, but was too penitent to deny the charge.

The Countess at once wrote a formal note to Princess Anatolie in which
she said that she had been hasty and spoken too soon, that her daughter
seemed undecided, and that nothing was to be said at present about
breaking the engagement. The marriage, she added, would be put off until
the autumn.

The Princess showed this communication to Monsieur Leroy when he came
in. He did not mean to tell her about his visit to the lawyer, for he
had made up his mind to play on her credulity as much as he could and to
attribute any advantage she might gain by his manoeuvres to
supernatural intervention. The Countess's letter surprised him very
much, and as he did not know what to do, it seemed easy to do nothing.
He expressed his disgust at Cecilia's vacillation.

"She is a flirt and her mother is a fool," he said, and the speech
seemed to him pithy and concise.

The old Princess raised her aristocratic eyebrows a little. She would
have expressed the same idea more delicately. There was a vulgar streak
in his character that often jarred on her, but she said nothing, for she
was inexplicably fond of him. For her own part, she was glad that
Cecilia had apparently changed her mind again.

Later in the day she received a few words from Guido, written in an
unsteady hand, to say that he was sorry he could not come and see her as
he had a bad attack of influenza. At the word she dropped the note as if
it burnt her fingers, and called Monsieur Leroy, for she believed that
influenza could be communicated in almost any way, and it was the only
disease she really feared: she had a presentiment that she was to die of
it.

"Take that thing away, Doudou!" she cried nervously. "Pick it up with
the tongs and burn it. He has the influenza! I am sure I have caught
it!"

Monsieur Leroy obeyed, while she retired to her own room to spend half
