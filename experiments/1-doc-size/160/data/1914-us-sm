Even as the thought came to me, however, I 
saw Claire start. "Look!" she exclaimed. 

"What is it?" 

"That woman there — in the green velvet! 
The fourth table." 

"I see her." 

"Do you know who she is?" 

"Who?" (I remembered Lady Dee's maxim 
about Ijong!) 

"Sylvia Castleman!" whispered Claire. (She 
always referred to her thus — seeming to say 
"I'm as much van Tuiver as she is!") 

"Are you sure?" I asked — lq order to say 
something. 

"I've seen her a score of times. I seem to be 
always running into her. That's Freddie Atkins 
she's talking to." 

"Indeed!" said I. 

"I know most of the men I see her with. But 
I have to walk by as if I'd never seen them. A 
queer world we live in, isn't it?" 

I could assent cordially to that proposition. 



"listen," I broke in, quickly. "Have you got 
anything to do? If not, come down to the 
Royalty and have tea with me." 

"Why not have it here?" 

"I've been waiting for some one from there, and 
I have to leave a message. Then I'll be free." 

She rose, to my vast relief, and we walked out. 
I could feel Sylvia's eyes following me; but I 
dared not try to send her a message — I would 
have to make up some explanation afterwards. 
"Who was your  well-dressed friend?" I could 
imagine her asking; but my mind was more 
concerned with the vision of what would happen 
if, in full sight of her companion, Mr. Freddie 
Atkins, she were to rise and walk over to Claire 
and myself! 



 



 

Seated in the "palm-room" of the other hotel, 
I sipped a cup of tea which I felt I had earned, 
while Claire had a little glass of the fancy-colored 
Hquids which the ladies in these places affect. 
The room was an aviary, with tropical plants and 
splashing fomitains — and birds of many gorgeous 
hues; I gazed from one to another of the splendid 
creatures, wondering how many of them were 
paying for their plumage in the same way as my 
companion. It would have taken a more prac- 
ticed eye than mine to say which, for if I had been 
asked, I would have taken Claire for a diplomat's 
wife. She had not less than a thousand dollars 
worth of raiment upon her, and its style made 
clear to all the world the fact that it had not 
been saved over from a previous season of pros- 
perity. She was a fine creature, who could 
carry any amount of sail; with her bold, black 
eyes she looked thoroiyhly competent, and it 
was hard to beheve in the fundamental softness 
of her character. 

I sat, looking about me, annoyed at having 
missed Sylvia, and only half listening to Claire. 
But suddenly she brought me to attention. 
"Well," she said, "I've met him." 

"Met whom?" 

"Douglas." 

I stared at her. "Douglas van Tuiver?" 



 



She nodded; and I suppressed a cry. 

"I told you he'd come back," she added, with 
a laugh. 

"You mean he came to see you?" 

I could not hide my concern. But there was 
no need to, for it flattered Claire's vanity. "No 
— not yet, but he will. I met him at Jack 
Taylor's — at a supper-party." 

"Did he know you were to be there?" 

"No. But he didn't leave when he saw me." 

There was a pause. I could not trust myself 
to say anything. But Claire had no intention of 
leaving me curious. "I don't think he's happy 
with her," she remarked. 

"What makes you say that?" 

"Oh, several things. I know him, you know. 
He wouldn't say he was." 

"Perhaps he didn't want to discuss it with 
you." 

'Oh, no — not that. He isn't reserved with 



me." 





'I should think it was dangerous to discuss 
one's wife under such circumstances," I laughed. 

Claire laughed also. "You should have heard 
what Jack had to say about his wife! She's 
down at Palm Beach." 

"She'd better come home," I ventured. 

"He was telling what a dance she leads him; 
she raises Cain if a woman looks at him — and 
she darons every woman he meets before the 
woman has a chance to look. Jack said marriage 
was hell — just hell. Reggie Channing thought it
