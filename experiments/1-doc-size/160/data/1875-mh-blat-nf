6 eggs—beaten very light.

Flavoring to taste.

Boil the milk, and stir in the corn-starch. Stir one minute and pour
into a bowl containing the yolks, the whites of two eggs and half
the sugar. Whip up for two or three minutes and put into a nice
baking-dish, buttered. Set in a pan of boiling water and bake half an
hour, or until firm. Just before withdrawing it from the oven, cover
with jelly or jam, put on dexterously and quickly, and this, with a
méringue made of the reserved whites and sugar. Shut the oven until
the méringue is set and slightly colored.

Eat cold, with cream.


CHERRY SOUFFLÉ PUDDING.

1 cup prepared flour.

2 cups of milk.

5 eggs.

3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.

Bitter almond flavoring.

½ pound crystallized or glacé cherries.

A pinch of salt.

Scald the milk, and stir into it the flour, wet up with a cup of
the milk. Boil one minute, stirring well up from the bottom of the
farina-kettle; mix in the yolks beaten light with the sugar, flavor,
and let it get perfectly cold. Then whip the whites until you can cut
them with a knife, and beat, fast and hard, into the custard. Butter a
mould thickly; strew with the cherries until the inside is pretty well
covered; put in the mixture—leaving room for puffing—and boil for an
hour and a half.

Dip into cold water; take it out and let it stand, after the lid is
removed, a full minute, before turning it out.

Eat warm with wine, or lemon sauce.


SPONGE-CAKE SOUFFLÉ PUDDING. +

12 square (penny) sponge-cakes—stale.

5 eggs.

1 cup milk.

2 glasses sherry.

½ cup of powdered sugar.

Put the cakes in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish; pour the wine
over them, and cover while you make the custard. Heat the milk and pour
over the yolks of the eggs, beaten and strained, and half the sugar.
Return to the fire, and stir until quite thick. Pour this upon the
soaked cakes, slowly, that they may not rise to the top; put in the
oven, and when it is again very hot, spread above it the whites whisked
stiff with the rest of the sugar.

Bake ten minutes, or until the méringue is lightly browned and firm.
Serve in the baking-dish.

Eat cold. It will be found very nice.


APPLE SOUFFLÉ PUDDING. +

6 or 7 fine juicy apples.

1 cup fine bread-crumbs.

4 eggs.

1 cup of sugar.

2 table-spoonfuls butter.

Nutmeg and a little grated lemon-peel.

Pare, core and slice the apples, and stew in a covered farina-kettle,
without a drop of water, until they are tender. Mash to a smooth pulp,
and, while hot, stir in butter and sugar. Let it get quite cold, and
whip in, first the yolks of the eggs, then the whites—beaten very
stiff—alternately with the bread-crumbs. Flavor, beat hard three
minutes, until all the ingredients are reduced to a creamy batter, and
bake in a buttered dish, in a moderate oven. It will take about an
hour to cook it properly. Keep it covered until ten minutes before you
take it out. This will retain the juices and prevent the formation of a
crust on the top.

Eat warm with “bee-hive sauce.”


RICE SOUFFLÉ PUDDING. +

½ cup raw rice.

1 pint of milk.

6 eggs.

4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.

1 table-spoonful butter.

Soak the rice in warm water enough to cover it well for two hours.
Put it over the fire in the same water, and simmer in a farina-kettle
until the rice is dry. Add the milk, shaking up the rice—not stirring
it—and cook slowly, covered, until tender throughout. Stir in the
butter, then the yolks of the eggs, beaten and strained, whatever
flavoring you may desire, and when these have cooled somewhat, the
whipped whites. Bake in a handsome pudding-dish, well buttered, half an
hour.

Eat warm—not hot—or very cold.


ARROWROOT SOUFFLÉ PUDDING.

3 cups of milk.

5 eggs.

1 large table-spoonful butter.

3 table-spoonfuls sugar.

4 table-spoonfuls Bermuda arrowroot, wet up with cold milk.

Vanilla or other flavoring.

Heat the milk to a boil, and stir into this the arrowroot. Simmer,
using your spoon freely all the time, until it thickens up well. Put in
the butter; take from the fire and beat into it the yolks and sugar,
previously whipped together. Stir hard and put in the whites, whisked
very stiff, and the flavoring.

Butter a neat baking-dish; put in the mixture and bake half an hour.

Sift powdered sugar over it, and serve immediately.


A VERY DELICATE SOUFFLÉ.

5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.

2 table-spoonfuls of arrowroot wet up in 4 table-spoonfuls cold water.

4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.

Rose-water flavoring.
