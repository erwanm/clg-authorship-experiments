you think." 

" I think you are very simple." And Madame Merle kept 
her eye upon her cup. " I have come to that with time. I 
judged you, as I say, of old ; but it is only since your marriage 
that I have understood you. I have seen better what you have 
been to your wife than I ever saw what you were for me. Please 
be very careful of that precious object." 

"It already has a small crack," said Osmond, dryly, as he put 
it down. "If you didn't understand me before I married, it 
was cruelly rash of you to put me into such a box. However, I 
took a fancy to my box myself ; I thought it would be a 
comfortable fit. I asked very little ; I only asked that she 
should like me." 

" That she should like you so much ! " 

" So much, of course ; in such a case one asks the maximum. 
That she should adore me, if you will. Oh yes, I wanted that." 

" I never adored you," said Madame Merle. 

" Ah, but you pretended to ! " 

" It is true that you never accused me of being a comfortable 
fit," Madame Merle went on. 

" My wife has declined declined to do anything of the sort," 
said Osmond. " If you are determined to make a tragedy of 
that, the tragedy is hardly for her." 

" The tragedy is for me ! " Madame Merle exclaimed, rising, 
with a long low sigh, but giving a glance at the same time at 
the contents of her mantel-shelf. "It appears that I am to be 
severely taught the disadvantages of a false position." 

" You express yourself like a sentence in a copy-book. We 
must look for our comfort where we can find it. If my wife 
doesn't like me, at least my child does. I shall look for com- 
pensations in Pansy. Fortunately I haven't a fault to find 
with her." 

" Ah," said Madame Merle, softly, " if I had a child- 
Osmond hesitated a moment and then, with a little formal 
air " The children of others may be a great interest ! " he 
announced. 

" You are more like a copy-book than I. There is something, 
after all, that holds us together.' 

" Is it the idea of the harm I may do you ? " Osmond asked. 

" No ; it's the idea of the good I may do for you. It is that," 
said Madame Merle, " that made me so jealous of Isabel. I 
want it to be my work," she added, with her face, which had 
grown hard and bitter, relaxing into its usual social expression. 





Osmond took up his hat and his umbrella, and after giving 
the former article two or three strokes with his coat-cuff " On 
the whole, I think," he said, "you had better leave it to me." 

After he had left her, Madame Merle went and lifted from 
the mantel-shelf the attenuated coffee-cup in which he -had 
mentioned the existence of a crack ; but she looked at it rather 
abstractedly. " Have I been so vile all for nothing ? " she 
murmured to herself. 





As the Countess Gemini was not acquainted with the ancient 
monuments, Isabel occasionally offered to introduce her to these 
interesting relics and to give their afternoon drive an antiquarian 
aim. The Countess, who professed to think her sister-in-law a 
prodigy of learning, never made an objection, and gazed at masses 
of Eoman brickwork as patiently as if they had been mounds of 
modern drapery. She was not an antiquarian ; but she was so 
delighted to be in Rome that she only desired to float with the 
current. She would gladly have passed an hour every day in 
the damp darkness of the Baths of Titus, if it had been a con- 
dition of her remaining at the Palazzo Roccanera. Isabel, 
however, was not a severe cicerone ; she used to visit the ruins 
chiefly because they offered an excuse for talking about other 
matters than the love-affairs of the ladies of Florence, as to which 
her companion was never weary of offering information. It 
must be added that during these visits the Countess was not 
very active ; her preference was to sit in the carriage and exclaim 
that everything was most interesting". It was in this manner 
that she had hitherto examined the Coliseum, to the infinite 
regret of her niece, who with all the respect that she owed her 
could not see why she should not descend from the vehicle 
ind enter the building. Pansy had so little chance to ramble 
ihat her view of the case was not wholly disinterested ; it may 
be divined that she had a secret hope that, once inside, her 
aunt might be induced to climb to the upper tiers. There came 
a day when the Countess announced her willingness to under- 
take this feat a mild afternoon in March, when the windy 
month expressed itself in occasional puffs of spring. The three 
ladies went into the Coliseum together, but Isabel left her com- 
panions to wander over the place. She had often ascended to 
those desolate ledges from which the Roman crowd used to 



 

bellow applause, and where now the wild flowers (when they are 
allowed), bloom in the deep crevices ; and to-day she felt weary, 
and preferred to sit in the despoiled arena. It made an inter- 
mission, too, for the Countess often asked more from one's 
attention than she gave in return ; and Isabel believed that when 
she was alone with her niece she let the dust gather for a moment 
upon the ancient scandals of Florence. She remained below, 
therefore, while Pansy guided her undiscriminating aunt to the 
steep brick staircase at the foot of which the custodian unlocks 
the tall wooden gate. The great inclosure was half in shadow ; 
the western sun brought out the pale red tone of the great blocks 
of travertine the latent colour which is the only living element 
in the immense ruin. Here and there wandered a peasant 
or a tourist, looking up at the far sky-line where in the clear 
stillness a multitude of swallows kept circling and plunging. 
Isabel presently became aware that one of the other visitors, 
planted in the middle of the arena, had turned his attention to 
her own person, and was looking at her with a certain little 
poise of the head, which she had some weeks before perceived to 
be characteristic of baffled but indestructible purpose. . Such an 
attitude, to-day, could belong only to Mr. Edward Rosier ; and 
this gentleman proved in fact to have been considering the 
question of speaking to her. When he had assured himself that 
she was unaccompanied he drew near, remarking that though 
she would not answer his letters she would perhaps not wholly 
close her ears to his spoken eloquence. '"She replied that her 
step-daughter was close at hand and she could only give him five 
minutes ; whereupon he took out his watch and sat down upon 
a broken block. 

" It's very soon told," said Edward Eosier. " I have sold all 
my bibelots ! " 

Isabel gave, instinctively, an exclamation of horror ; it was as 
if he had told her he had had all his teeth drawn. 

" I have sold them by auction at the Hotel Drouot," he went 
>n. " The sale took place three days ago, and they have tele- 
graphed me the result. It's magnificent." 

" I am glad to hear it ; but I wish you had kept your pretty 
things."
