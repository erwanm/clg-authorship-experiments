"Better let it alone; I'll only rumple it some 
more!" he cried, omniously. 
"You mustn t! I forbid you!" 
"But I want to!" 
"Not now, then " 
"Yes immediately !" 
    "Rex you mustn't O, Rex II" 
"What?" he laughed, holding her by her slen 
der wrists. 
She flushed scarlet and struggled to break 
away. 
"Only one," 
 
"No." 
"One." 
"None." 
"Shall I let you go?" 
"Yes," she said, but catching sight of his 
face, stopped short. 
He dropped her hands with a laugh and looked 
at her. Then she came slowly up to him, and 
flushing crimson, pulled his head down to hers. 
"Yvonne, do you love me? Truthfully?" 
"Rex, can you ask?" Her warm little head 
lay against his throat, her heart beat against his, 
her breath fell upon his cheek, and her curls 
clustered among his own. 
"Yvonne Yvonne," he murmured, "I love 
you, once and forever." 
"Once and forever," she repeated, in a half 
whisper. 
"Forever," he said.

An hour later they were seated tete-a-tete at 
Gethryn's little table. She had not permitted 
him to poach the eggs, and perhaps they were 
better on that account. 
"Bachelor habits must cease," she cried, with 
a little laugh, and Gethryn smiled in doubtful 
acquiescence. 
"Do you like grilled sardines on toast?" she 
asked. 
"I seem to," he smiled, finishing his fourth; 
"they are delicious, yours," he added. 
"Oh, that tea!" she cried, "and not one bit 
of sugar. What a hopelessly careless man!" 
But Gethryn jumped up, crying, "Wait a mo 
ment!" and returned triumphantly with a huge 
mass of rock-candy, the remains of one of 
Clifford's abortive attempts at "rye-and-rock." 
They each broke off enough for their cups, 
and Gethryn, tasting his, declared the tea "de 
licious." Yvonne sat, chipping an egg and 
casting sidelong glances at Gethryn, which were 
always met and returned with interest 
"Yvonne, I want to tell you a secret." 
"What, Rex?" 
"I love you." 
"Oh!" 
"And you?" 
"No not at all!" cried the girl, shaking her 
pretty head. Presently she gave him a swift 
glance from beneath her drooping lashes, 
 
"Rex?" 
"What, Yvonne?" 
"I want to tell you a secret." 
"What, Yvonne?" 
"If you eat so many sardines " 
"Oh!" cried Gethryn, half angrily, but laugh 
ing, "you must pay for that!" 
"\Vhat?" she said, innocently, but jumped 
up and kept the table between him and herself. 
"You know!" he cried, chasing her into a 
corner. 
"We are two babies," she said, very red, 
following him back to the table. The pate was 
eaten in comparative quiet. 
"Now," she said, with great dignity, setting 
down her glass, "behave and get me some hot 
water." 
Gethryn meekly brought it. 
"If you touch me while I am washing these 
dishes!!!" 
"But let me help?" 
"No, go and sit down instantly." 
He fled in affected terror, and ensconced him 
self upon the sofa. Presently he inquired, in a 
plaintive voice: "Have you nearly finished?" 
"No," said the girl, carefully drying and ar 
ranging the quaint Egyptian tea-set, "and I 
won't for ages." 
"But you're not going to wash all those 
things? The concierge does that." 
"No, only the wine-glasses and the tea-set. 
The idea of trusting such fragile cups to a con 
cierge! What a boy!" 
But she was soon ready to dry her slender 
hands, and caught up a towel with a demure 
glance at Gethryn. 
"Which do you think most of, your dogs, 
or me?" 
"Pups." 
"That parrot, or me?" 
"Poll." 
"The raven, or me? The cat, or me?" 
"Bird and puss." 
She stole over to his side and knelt down. 
"Rex, if you ever tire of me, if you ever are 
unkind, if you ever leave me, I think I shall 
die." 
He drew her to him. "Yvonne," he whispered, 
"we can't always be together." 
"I know it, I'm foolish," she faltered. 
"I shall not always be a student. I shall not 
always be in Paris, dear Yvonne." 
She leaned closer to him. 
"I must go back to America some day." 
"And and marry?" she whispered, chok- 
"No not to marry," he said, "but it is my 
home." 
"I I know it, Rex, but don't let us think of 
it. Rex," she said, some moments after, "are 
you like all students?" 
"How do you mean?" 
"Have you ever loved, before, a girl, here 
in Paris, like me?" 
"There are none, like you." 
"Answer me, Rex." 
"No, I never have," he said, truthfully. 
Presently he added, "And you, Yvonne?" 
She put her warm little hand across his mouth. 
"Don't ask," she murmured. 
"But I do!" he cried, struggling to see her 
eyes, "won't you tell me?" 
She hid her face tight against his breast. 
"You know I have; that is why I am alone 
here, in Paris," 
"You loved him?" 
"Yes, not as I love you." 
Presently she raised her eyes to his. 
"Shall I tell you all? I am like so many so 
many others. When you know their story, you 
know mine." 
He leaned down and kissed her. 
"Don't tell me," he said. 
But she went on. 
"I was only seventeen I am nineteen now. 
He was an officer at at Chartres, where we 
lived. He took me to Paris." 
"And left you." 
"He died of the fever in Tonquin." 
"When?" 
"Three weeks ago." 
"And you heard?" 
"To-night." 
"Then he did leave you." 
"Don t, Rex, he never loved me, and I I 
never really loved him. I found that out." 
"When did you find it out?"
