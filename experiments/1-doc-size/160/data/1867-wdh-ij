of the conventual character of the place was dispelled 
by the assistant's hurrying to say, "And when we 
can get the poor things well married, we are glad 
to do so." 

" But how does any one ever see them ? " 
" Eh ! well, that is easily managed. Once a 
month we dress the marriageable girls in their best, 
and take them for a walk in the street. If an hon- 
est young man falls in love with one of them going 




by, he comes to the Superior, and describes her as 
well as he can, and demands to see her. She is 
called, and if both are pleased, the marriage is ar- 
ranged. You see it is a very simple affair." 

And there was, to the assistant's mind, nothing odd 
in the whole business, insomuch that I felt almost 
ashamed of marveling at it. 

Issuing from the backdoor of the convent, we as- 
cended by stairs and gateways into garden spaces, 
chiefly planted with turnips and the like poor but 
respectable vegetables, and curiously adorned with 
fragments of antique statuary, and here and there a 
fountain in a corner, trickling from moss-grown rocks, 
and falling into a trough of travertine, about the feet 
of some poor old goddess or Virtue who had forgot- 
ten what her name was. 

Once, the assistant said, speaking as if the thing 
had been within her recollection, though it must 
have been centuries before, the antiquities of the 
Conservatorio were much more numerous and strik- 
ing ; but they were now removed to the different 
museums. Nevertheless they had still a beautiful 
prospect left, which we were welcome to enjoy if we 
would follow her ; and presently, to our surprise, we 
stepped from the garden upon the roof of the Temple 
of Peace. The assistant had not boasted without 
reason : away before us stretched the Campagna, a 
level waste, and empty, but for the umbrella-palms 
that here and there waved like black plumes upon 
it, and for the arched lengths of the acqueducts that 
seemed to stalk down from the ages across the 



 

melancholy expanse like files of giants, with now 
and then a ruinous gap in the line, as if one had 
fallen out weary by the way. The city all around 
us glittered asleep in the dim December sunshine, 
and far below us, on the length of the Forum over 
which the Appian Way stretched from the Capito- 
line Hill under the Arch of Septimius Severus and 
the Arch of Titus to the Arch of Constantino, leav- 
ing the Coliseum on the left, and losing itself in 
the foliage of the suburbs, the Past seemed strug- 
gling to emerge from the ruins, and to reshape 
and animate itself anew. The effort was more suc- 
cessful than that which we had helped the Past to 
make when standing on the level of the Forum ; 
but Antiquity must have been painfully conscious of 
the incongruity of the red-legged Zouaves wander- 
ins over the grass, and of the bewildered tourists 



trying to make her out with their Hurrays. 

In a day or two after this we returned again to 
our Conservatorio, where we found that the excite- 
ment created by our first visit had been kept fully 
alive by the events attending the photographing of 
Virginia for her father. Not only Virginia was 
there to receive us, but her grandmother also an 
old, old woman, dumb through some infirmity of 
age, who could only weep and smile in token of her 
content. I think she had but a dim idea, after all, 
of what went on beyond the visible fact of Virginia's 
photograph, and that she did not quite understand 
how we could cause it to be taken for her son. 
She was deeply compassionated by the Superior, who 



 

rendered her pity with a great deal of gesticulation, 
casting up her eyes, shrugging her shoulders, and 
sighing grievously. But the assistant's cheerfulness 
could not be abated even by the spectacle of extreme 
age ; and she made the most of the whole occasion, 
recounting with great minuteness all the incidents of 
the visit to the photographer's, and running to get 
the dress Virginia sat in, that we might see how ex- 
actly it was given in the picture. Then she gave us 
much discourse concerning the Conservatorio and its 
usages, and seemed not to wish us to think that life 
there was altogether eventless. " Here we have a 
little amusement also,"' she said. " The girls have 
their relatives to visit them sometimes, and then in 
the evening they dance. Oh, they enjoy themselves ! 
I am half old (mezzo-vecchia). I am done with 
these things. But for youth, always kept down, 
something lively is wanted." 

When we took leave of these simple folks, we 
took leave of almost the only natural and unprepared 
aspect of Italian life which we were to see in Rome ; 
but we did not know this at the time. 





INDEED, it seems to me that all moisture of ro- 
mance and adventure has been wellnigh sucked out 
of travel in Italy, and that compared with the old 
time, when the happy wayfarer journeyed by vettura 
through the innumerable little states of the Penin- 
sula, - halted every other mile to show his passport, 



 

and robbed by customs officers in every color of 
shabby uniform and every variety of cocked hat, 
the present railroad period is one of but stale and 
insipid flavor. Much of local life and color re- 
mains, of course ; but the hurried traveller sees little 
of it, and, passed from one grand hotel to another, 
without material change in the cooking or the meth- 
ods of extortion, he might nearly as well remain at 
Paris. The Italians, who live to so great extent by 
the travel through their country, learn our abomina- 
ble languages and minister to our detestable comfort 
and propriety, till we have slight chance to know 
them as we once could, musical, picturesque, and 
full of sweet, natural knaveries, graceful falsehood, 
and all uncleanness. Rome really belongs to the 
Anglo-Saxon nations, and the Pope and the past 
seem to be carried on entirely for our diversion. 
Every thing is systematized as thoroughly as in a 
museum where the objects are all ticketed ; and our 
prejudices are consulted even down to alms-giving. 
Honest Beppo is gone from the steps in the Piazza, di 
Spagna, and now the beggars are labeled like police- 
men, with an immense plate bearing the image of St. 
Peter, so that you may know you give to a worthy 
person when you bestow charity on one of them, and 
not, alas ! to some abandoned impostor, as in former 
days. One of these highly recommended mendicants 
gave the last finish to the system, and begged of us
