forbore to speak again, for never in all his life had he seen a 
man who conveyed to him the impression of such resistless 
force as this man. He was truly a superhuman creature, terri- 
fying, panoplied in lightnings of wrath. 

The door of the house opened again, and Lacey Granitch 
came in, with a man on each side holding him by the arms, 
and a pair of handcuffs on his wrist. Of all the dreadful 
spectacles that Jimmie had seen that dreadful night, the worst 
was the face of the young master of the Empire Machine Shops. 
It was green absolutely and literally green. His knees trembled 
so that he seemed about to sink to the floor, and his dark eyes 
were those of an animal in a trap. 

There came another man behind him carrying two black 
cases in his hands. He opened one, and took out some instru- 
ment with wires attached, and hung part of it to a hook on the 
wall; he pressed a switch, and a soft white radiance flooded the 
room. The man who was in command, the one whom the lady 
had called "Paul," now turned to Jimmie and his wife. "You 
may take your lamp' he said. "Go into the other room and 
stay there till we call you, please' 

"W-w-what are you goin' to do ?" Jimmie found courage to 
stammer again. But the other merely bade him to go into the 
other room and stay, and it would be all right, and he would be 
well paid for his time and trouble. There was no use trying 
to interfere; no use trying to get away, for the house would be 
watched. 



Jimmie Junior had been wakened by the uproar, and was 
whimpering; so Lizzie hurried to quiet him, and Jimmie set 
the little smoky lamp on the dresser, and went and sat on the 
bed beside her, holding her hand in his. Both their hands were 
shaking in a way that was amazing. 

Every sound from the other room was plainly audible. 
Lacey was pleading, and "Paul" commanded him to hold his 
tongue. There was a scuffle, and then terrified moans, which 
died away. There began to steal into the Higgins bed-room 
a most ghastly odour; they could not imagine what it was. 



 

And then they began to hear wild clamour from Lacey Granitch, 
as if he were suffering in hell. It was awful beyond words; 
the perspiration came out in beads on the faces of the listeners, 
and Jimmie was just about making up his mind that it was 
his duty to rush in and protest, or perhaps to climb out of the 
window and make an effort to steal away and summon help, 
when the door opened and the man called "Paul" came in, 
closing the door behind him. 

"It's all right' said he. "People always make a fuss 
when they're given an anaesthetic, so don't let it frighten you." 
And he stood here waiting, rigid, grim, while the sounds went 
on. Finally they died away and silence fell a long, long 
silence. He opened the door and went back into the ether 
room, and the two Jimmies were left holding each other's shak- 
ing hands. 

Now and then they heard a man speak in a low voice, or 
some one move across the room; and always that ghastly, over- 
powering odour kept creeping in, making them think they would 
die of suffocation, and their three babies also. The suspense 
and horror had become almost unbearable when finally they 
began to hear Lacey Granitch again, moaning, sobbing most 
harrowing sounds. "My God! My God!" whispered Lizzie. 
"What are they doing?" And when Jimmie did not answer, 
she whispered again. "We ought to stop them! We ought to 
get help!" 

But then once more the door opened, and "Paul" came in. 
"It's all right now," he said. "He's coming out." Neither of 
the Jimmies had the least idea what "coming out" meant, but 
they were reassured to know that the masterful person at least 
was satisfied. They waited; they heard Lacey vomiting, as it 
seemed and then they heard him cursing, in between his feeble 
gasps. He called the men the same foul name that he had 
called Jimmie; and that somehow made the whole affair seem 
better it brought one down to earth again ! 

"Paul" went out and stayed for a while, and when he came 
back, he said, "We're going now; and understand, there's 
nothing for you to worry about. We shall leave the patient 
here, and as soon as we get to a telephone, we'll notify the 
hospital to send an ambulance. So all you have to do is to wait, 
and keep quiet and don't worry. And here's something for 
the use of your house " The man put out his hand with a 





roll of bills, which Jimmie mechanically took "and if any- 
body asks you about what happened to-night, just say you didn't 
see anything and don't know anything whatever about it. I'm 
sorry to have troubled you, but it couldn't be helped. And 
now, good night." 

And so the masterful young man went out, and they heard 
him and his companions tramping down the porch-steps. They 
listened, until they heard the automobile start up and disappear 
in the darkness. Then from the next room they heard a moan. 

Trembling with terror, Jimmie got up and stole to the door, 
and opened it a tiny crack. The room was in utter darkness. 
"Get me some water !" the voice of Lacey groaned ; and Jimmie 
tiptoed back, and got the little smoky lamp, and came to the 
door again. He peered in, and saw that Lacey was lying on the 
floor with a sheet over him everything but his head, which was 
resting on a pillow. His face was yellow and twisted with 
pain. "Water ! Water !" he sobbed ; and Jimmie rushed to get 
a glass and fill it from the pail. When he brought it, Lacey 
first tried to drink, and then began to vomit; then he lay, 
sobbing softly to himself. He saw Jimmie staring at him, and 
his eyes filled with sudden hate and he whispered, "This is 
what you got me in for, you damned little skunk!" 






THE ambulance arrived, and the two attendants who came 
 with it brought in a stretcher and carried young Granitch 
away. Jimmie opened the windows to get rid of the odour of 
ether, and meantime he and Lizzie sat for hours, discussing 
every aspect of the dreadful scene they had witnessed, and 
speculating as to its meaning. When Jimmie investigated the 
roll of bills which had been slipped into his hand, he found 
that there were ten of them, new, crisp, and bright yellow, 
each having the figure twenty printed upon it. It was more 
money than these two humble little people had ever had or 
expected to have in all their lives. It was literally blood-money, 
they felt, but it would be hard to see who would be benefited 
if they rejected it. Certainly the deed which had been done 
that night could not be undone not for all the money that 
old Granitch had heaped up in his vaults. 

Jimmie kept quiet, as he had been bidden, and apparently 
no one told about his part in the affair no reporters came out to 
his country home to ask for interviews. But when he went to 
the cross-roads store a couple of nights later he found that the 
story was all over nobody was talking or thinking about any- 
thing else. The news, in fact, had gone by telegraph all over 
the world, and wherever people read it they shuddered with 
horror, and the Socialists had a choice illustration of the effect 
of excessive wealth upon morals. 

There were half a dozen versions of the story, Jimmie 
found; some declared that the outraged husband had caught 
young Granitch in his home and had fetched a surgeon there; 
others that he had taken him to a hospital; others that the 
operation had been performed in a road-house nearby. But none
