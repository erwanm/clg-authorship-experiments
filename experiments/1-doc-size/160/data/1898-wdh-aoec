“Oh no,” she answered pathetically, as if she were quite past expecting
that or anything like it.

We were silent again.  At the end of the next piece they all rose, and
the wife said timidly to me, “Well, good-evening,” as if she might be
venturing too far; and her husband came to her rescue with “Well,
good-evening, sir.”  The young girl merely bowed.

I did not stay much longer, for I was eager to get home and tell my wife
about my adventure, which seemed to me of a very rare and thrilling kind.
I believed that if I could present it to her duly, it would interest her
as much as it had interested me.  But somehow, as I went on with it in
the lamplight of her room, it seemed to lose colour and specific
character.

“You are always making up these romances about young girls being off and
disappointed of a good time ever since we saw that poor little Kitty
Ellison with her cousins at Niagara,” said Mrs. March.  “You seem to have
it on the brain.”

“Because it’s the most tragical thing in the world, and the commonest in
our transition state,” I retorted.  I was somewhat exasperated to have my
romance treated as so stale a situation, though I was conscious now that
it did want perfect novelty.  “It’s precisely for that reason that I like
to break my heart over it.  I see it every summer, and it keeps me in a
passion of pity.  Something ought to be done about it.”

“Well, don’t you try to do anything, Basil, unless you write to the
newspapers.”

“I suppose,” I said, “that if the newspapers could be got to take hold of
it, perhaps something might be done.”  The notion amused me; I went on to
play with it, and imagined Saratoga, by a joint effort of the leading
journals, recolonised with the social life that once made it the paradise
of young people.

“I have been writing to the children,” said my wife, “and telling them to
stay on at York Harbour if the Herricks want them so much.  They would
hate it here.  You say the girl looked cross.  I can’t exactly imagine a
cross goddess.”

“There were lots of cross goddesses,” I said rather crossly myself; for I
saw that, after having trodden my romance in the dust, she was willing I
should pick it up again and shake it off, and I wished to show her that I
was not to be so lightly appeased.

“Perhaps I was thinking of angels,” she murmured.

“I distinctly didn’t say she was an angel,” I returned.

“Now, come, Basil; I see you’re keeping something back.  What did you try
to do for those people?  Did you tell them where you were stopping?”

“Yes, I did.  They asked me, and I told them.”

“Did you brag the place up?”

“On the contrary, I understated its merits.”

“Oh, very well, then,” she said, quite as if I had confessed my guilt;
“they will come here, and you will have your romance on your hands for
the rest of the month.  I’m thankful we’re going away the first of
August.”

THE next afternoon, while we were sitting in the park waiting for the
Troy band to begin playing, and I was wondering just when they would
reach the “Washington Post March,” which I like because I can always be
sure of it, my unknown friends came strolling our way.  The man looked
bewildered and bored, with something of desperation in his troubled eye,
and his wife looked tired and disheartened.  The young girl, still in
white duck, wore the same air of passive injury I had noted in her the
night before.  Their faces all three lighted up at sight of me; but they
faded again at the cold and meagre response I made to their smiles under
correction of my wife’s fears of them.  I own it was base of me; but I
had begun to feel myself that it might be too large a contract to attempt
their consolation, and, in fact, after one is fifty scarcely any romance
will keep overnight.

My wife glanced from them to me, and read my cowardly mind; but she
waited till they passed, as they did after an involuntary faltering in
front of us, and were keeping on down the path, looking at the benches,
which were filled on either hand.  She said, “Weren’t those your
friends?”

“They were the persons of my romance.”

“No matter.  Go after them instantly and bring them back here, poor
things.  We can make room for them.”

I rose.  “Isn’t this a little too idyllic?  Aren’t you rather overdoing
it?”

“Don’t speak to me, Basil!  I never heard of anything so atrocious.  Go
on your knees to them if they refuse!  They can sit here with me, and you
and he can stand.  Fly!”

I knew she was punishing me for her own reluctance; but I flew, in that
sense of the term, and easily overhauled them in the tangle of people
coming and going in the path, and the nursemaids pushing their
perambulators in either direction.  Hat in hand I delivered my message.
I could see that it gave the women great pleasure and the man some doubt.
His mouth fell open a little; their cheeks flushed and their eyes shone.

“I don’t know as we better,” the wife hesitated; “I’m afraid we’ll crowd
you.”  And she looked wistfully toward my wife.  The young girl looked at
her.

“Not at all!” I cried.  “There’s an abundance of room.  My wife’s keeping
the places for you,”—in fact, I saw her putting her arm out along the
bench, and explaining to a couple who had halted in front of her that the
seats were taken—“and she’ll be disappointed.”

“Well,” the woman consented, with a little sigh of triumph that touched
me, and reanimated all my interest in her and in her friend.  She said,
with a sort of shy, instinctive politeness, “I don’t know as you and Mr.
Deering got acquainted last night.”

“My name is March,” I said, and I shook the hand of Mr. Deering.  It was
rather thick.

“And this—is our friend,” Mrs. Peering went on, in presentation of me to
the young lady, “Miss Gage, that’s come with us.”

I was delighted that I had guessed their relative qualities so perfectly,
and when we arrived at Mrs. March I glibly presented them.  My wife was
all that I could have wished her to be of sympathetic and intelligent.
She did not overdo it by shaking hands, but she made places for the
ladies, smiling cordially; and Mrs. Deering made Miss Gage take the seat
between them.  Her husband and I stood awhile in front of them, and then
I said we would go off and find chairs somewhere.

We did not find any till we had climbed to the upland at the south-east
of the park, and then only two iron ones, which it was useless to think
of transporting.  But there was no reason why we should not sit in them
where they were: we could keep the ladies in plain sight, and I could not
mistake “Washington Post” when the band came to it.  Mr. Deering sank
into one of the chairs with a sigh of satisfaction which seemed to
complete itself when he discovered in the thick grass at his feet a twig
from one of the tall, slim pines above us.  He bent over for it, and
then, as he took out his penknife and clicked open a blade to begin
whittling, he cast up a critical glance at the trees.

“Pretty nice pines,” he said; and he put his hand on the one next to us
with a sort of appreciation that interested me.

“Yes; the trees of Saratoga are the glory of the place,” I returned.  “I
never saw them grow anywhere else so tall and slim.  It doesn’t seem the
effect of crowding either.  It’s as if there was some chemical force in
the soil that shot them up.  They’re like rockets that haven’t left the
ground yet.”

“It’s the crowding,” he said seriously, as if the subject were not to be
trifled with.  “It’s the habit of all these trees—pines and oaks and
maples, I don’t care what they are—to spread, and that’s what we tell our
