"I knew 'Fat Jack' and 'Tickle-me-Foot,'" answered Fosdick.

"This of course increases the difficulty of finding and identifying the
boy," said Mr. Bates. "Here," he said, taking a card photograph from
his pocket, "is a picture of my daughter at the time of her marriage. I
have had these taken from a portrait in my possession."

"Can you spare me one?" asked Dick. "It may help me to find the boy."

"I will give one to each of you. I need not say that I shall feel most
grateful for any service you may be able to render me, and will gladly
reimburse any expenses you may incur, besides paying you liberally for
your time. It will be better perhaps for me to leave fifty dollars with
each of you to defray any expenses you may be at."

"Thank you," said Dick; "but I am well supplied with money, and will
advance whatever is needful, and if I succeed I will hand in my bill."

Fosdick expressed himself in a similar way, and after some further
conversation he and Dick rose to go.

"I congratulate you on your wealth, Fosdick," said Dick, when they
were outside. "You're richer than I am now."

"I never should have got this money but for you, Dick. I wish you'd
take some of it."

"Well, I will. You may pay my fare home on the horse-cars."

"But really I wish you would."

But this Dick positively refused to do, as might have been expected.
He was himself the owner of two up-town lots, which he eventually sold
for five thousand dollars, though they only cost him one, and had three
hundred dollars besides in the bank. He agreed, however, to let Fosdick
henceforth bear his share of the expenses of board, and this added two
dollars a week to the sum he was able to lay up.

CHAPTER IV.

A DIFFICULT COMMISSION.


It need hardly be said that Fosdick was punctual to his appointment at
the Astor House on the following day.

He found Mr. Bates in the reading-room, looking over a Milwaukie paper.

"Good-morning, Mr. Fosdick," he said, extending his hand. "I suppose
your time is limited, therefore it will be best for us to go at once to
the bank."

"You are very kind, sir, to take so much trouble on my account," said
Fosdick.

"We ought all to help each other," said Mr. Bates. "I believe in that
doctrine, though I have not always lived up to it. On second thoughts,"
he added, as they got out in front of the hotel, "if you approve of my
suggestions about the purchase of bank shares, it may not be necessary
to go to the bank, as you can take this cheque in payment."

"Just as you think best, sir. I can depend upon your judgment, as you
know much more of such things than I."

"Then we will go at once to the office of Mr. Ferguson, a Wall Street
broker, and an old friend of mine. There we will give an order for some
bank shares."

Together the two walked down Broadway until they reached Trinity
Church, which fronts the entrance to Wall Street. Here then they
crossed the street, and soon reached the office of Mr. Ferguson.

Mr. Ferguson, a pleasant-looking man with sandy hair and whiskers, came
forward and shook Mr. Bates cordially by the hand.

"Glad to see you, Mr. Bates," he said. "Where have you been for the
last four years?"

"In Milwaukie. I see you are at the old place."

"Yes, plodding along as usual. How do you like the West?"

"I have found it a good place for business, though I am not sure
whether I like it as well to live in as New York."

"Shan't you come back to New York some time?"

Mr. Bates shook his head.

"My business ties me to Milwaukie," he said. "I doubt if I ever return."

"Who is this young man?" said the broker, looking at Fosdick. "He is
not a son of yours I think?"

"No; I am not fortunate enough to have a son. He is a young friend
who wants a little business done in your line and, I have accordingly
brought him to you."

"We will do our best for him. What is it?"

"He wants to purchase twenty shares in some good city bank. I used to
know all about such matters when I lived in the city, but I am out of
the way of such knowledge now."

"Twenty shares, you said?"

"Yes."

"It happens quite oddly that a party brought in only fifteen minutes
since twenty shares in the ---- Bank to dispose of. It is a good bank,
and I don't know that he can do any better than take them."

"Yes, it is a good bank. What interest does it pay now?"

"Eight per cent."[2]

"That is good. What is the market value of the stock?"

"It is selling this morning at one hundred and twenty."

"Twenty shares then will amount to twenty-four hundred dollars."

"Precisely."

"Well, perhaps we had better take them. What do you say, Mr. Fosdick?"

"If you advise it, sir, I shall be very glad to do so."

"Then the business can be accomplished at once, as the party left us
his signature, authorizing the transfer."

The transfer was rapidly effected. The broker's commission of
twenty-five cents per share amounted to five dollars. It was found on
paying this, added to the purchase money, that one hundred and nineteen
dollars remained,--the cheque being for two thousand five hundred and
twenty-four dollars.

The broker took the cheque, and returned this sum, which Mr. Bates
handed to Fosdick.

"You may need this for a reserve fund," he said, "to draw upon if
needful until your dividend comes due. The bank shares will pay you
probably one hundred and sixty dollars per year."

"One hundred and sixty dollars!" repeated Fosdick, in surprise. "That
is a little more than three dollars a week."

"Yes."

"It will be very acceptable, as my salary at the store is not enough to
pay my expenses."

"I would advise you not to break in upon your capital if you can avoid
