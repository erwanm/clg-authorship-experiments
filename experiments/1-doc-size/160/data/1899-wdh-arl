did." 

" It didn 't matter ; it could only have made bad 
worse. It can 't help me to say that somehow I was 
wishing and trying to do what was right ; but I was." 

" Oh, I know that, Mr. Gregory," said Clementina, 
generously. 

"Then you didn 't doubt me, in spite of all?" 



 

" I thought you would know what to do. No, I 
didn 't doubt you, exactly." 

" I didn 't deserve your trust ! " he cried. " How 
came that man to mention me ? " he demanded, abrupt 
ly, after a moment 's silence. 

" Mr. Belsky ? It was the first night I saw him, 
and we were talking about Americans, and he began 
to tell me about an American friend of his, who was 
very conscientious. I thought it must be you the 
fust moment," said Clementina, smiling with an im 
personal pleasure in the fact. 

" From the conscientiousness ? " he asked, in bitter 
self-irony. 

" Why, yes," she returned, simply. " That was 
what made me think of you. And the last time when 
he began to talk about you, I couldn 't stop him, al 
though I knew he had no right to." 

" He had no right. But I gave him the power to 
do it ! He meant no harm, but I enabled him to do 
all the harm." 

" Oh, if he 's only alive, now, there is no harm ! " 

He looked into her eyes with a misgiving from 
which he burst impetuously. " Then you do care for 
me still, after all that I have done to make you detest 
me ? " He started toward her, but she shrank back. 

" I didn 't mean that," she hesitated. 

" You know that I love you, that I have always 
loved you ? " 

" Yes," she assented. " But you might be sorry 
again that you had said it." It sounded like coquetry, 
but he knew it was not coquetry. 



 

"Never! I 've  wished to say it again, ever since 
that night at Middlemount ; I have always felt bound 
by what I said then, though I took back my words 
for your sake. But the promise was always there, 
and my life was in it. You believe that ? " 

" Why, I always believed what you said, Mr. Greg 
ory." 

"Well?" 

Clementina paused, with her head seriously on one 
side. " I should want to think about it before I said 
anything." 

" You are right," he submitted, dropping his out 
stretched arms to his side. " I have been thinking 
only of myself, as usual." 

" No," she protested, compassionately. " But 
doesn 't it seem as if we ought to be su a, this time ? 
I did ca e for you then, but I was very young, and I 
don 't know yet I thought I had always felt just as 
you did, but now Don 't you think we had both 
betta wait a little while till we ah moa suttain ? " 

They stood looking at each other, and he said, with 
a kind of passionate self-denial, "Yes, think it over 
for me, too. I will come back, if you will let me." 

" Oh, thank you ! " she cried after him, gratefully, 
as if his forbearance were the greatest favor. 

When he was gone she tried to release herself from 
the kind of abeyance in which she seemed to have 
gone back and been as subject to him as in the first 
days when he had awed her and charmed her with 
his superiority at Middlemount, and be again older 
and freer as she had grown since. 



 

He came back late in the afternoon, looking jaded 
and distraught. Hinkle, who looked neither, was 
with him. " Well," he began, " this is the greatest 
thing in my experience. Belsky 's not only alive and 
well, but Mr. Gregory and I are both at large. I did 
think, one time, that the police would take us into 
custody on account of our morbid interest in the thing, 
and I don 't believe we should have got off, if the 
Consul hadn 't gone bail for us, so to speak. I thought 
we had better take the Consul in, on our way, and it 
was lucky we did." 

Clementina did not understand all the implications, 
but she was willing to take Mr. Hinkle 's fun on trust. 
" I don 't believe you 'll convince Mrs. Landa that Mr. 
Belsky 's alive and well, till you bring him back to say 
so." 

" Is that so ! " said Hinkle. " Well, we must have 
him brought back by the authorities, then. Perhaps 
they 'll bring him, anyway. They can 't try him for 
suicide, but as I understand the police, here, a man 
can 't lose his hat over a bridge in Florence with im 
punity, especially in a time of high water. Anyway, 
they 're identifying Belsky by due process of law in 
Rome, now, and I guess Mr. Gregory " he nodded 
toward Gregory, who sat silent and absent " will be 
kept under surveillance till the whole mystery is 
cleared up." 

Clementina responded gayly still, but with less and 
less sincerity, and she let Hinkle go at last with the 
feeling that he knew she wished him to go. He 
made a brave show of not seeing this, and when he 



 

was gone, she remembered that she had not thanked 
him for the trouble he had taken on her account, and 
her heart ached after him with a sense of his sweet 
ness and goodness, which she had felt from the first 
through his quaint drolling. It was as if the door 
which closed upon him shut her out of the life she 
had been living of late, and into the life of the past 
where she was subject again to the spell of Gregory 's 
mood ; it was hardly his will. 

He began at once : " I wished to make you say 
something this morning that I have no right to hear 
you say, yet ; and I have been trying ever since to 
think how I could ask you whether you could share 
my life with me, and yet not ask you to do it. But 
I can 't do anything without knowing You may
