wrist, and he never hits the bandage by mistake never ! You 
strike high tierce like lightning and your blade is back in guard 
oh yes ! but before you are there his deep-carte sits in the middle 
of your cheek. Whatever you do, it is the same.' 

Every one was listening, and Greif frowned at the speaker, whose 
intention was evident. He wanted to frighten Rex by an account 
of his adversary's prowess. Rex looked grave but did not appear 
in the least disturbed. 

' So ? ' he ejaculated. * Really ! Well, I can put a silver thaler 
in my cheek and save my teeth, at all events. They are very good.' 

A roar of laughter greeted this reponse. 

' But that is contrary to the code,' objected the student, laughing 
with the rest. He was not an ill-humoured man in reality. 

' Yes I was joking,' said Rex. ' But I once saw a man fight 
with an iron nose on his face.' 

' How was that ? ' was asked by every one. 

' He was a brave fellow of the right sort,' said Rex, ' but he 
had a long nose and a short arm. In fact he had formed the habit 
of parrying with his nose, like a Greek statue you know, all those 
they find have had their noses knocked off by Turks. Now the 
nose is a noble feature, and is of great service to man, when he 
wants to find out whether he is in Italy or Germany. But as a 
weapon of defence it leaves much to be desired. The man of whom 
I am telling you had grown so much used to using it in this way, 
that whenever he saw anything coming in the shape of a carte he 
thrust it forward as naturally as a pig does when he sees an acorn, 
After a couple of semesters the cartes sat on his nose from bridge 
to tip, one after the other, like the days of the week in a calendar. 
But when the third semester began, and the cartes began to fall too 
near together, and sometimes two in the same place, the doctors said 
that the nose was worn-out, though it had once been good. And 
the man told the second in charge, and the second told the first, and 
the first laid the matter before the assembled Korps. Thereupon 
the whole Seniorum Conventus sat in solemn committee upon this 
war-worn nose, and decided that its owner need fight no more. 
But he was not only brave ; he possessed the invention of Prome- 



 

theus, combined with the diabolical sense of humour which so much 
distinguished the late Mephistopheles. He offered to go on fighting 
if he might be allowed an iron nose. Goetz of Berlichingen, he 
said, had won battles with an iron hand, and the case was analogous. 
The proposition was put to the vote and carried unanimously 
amidst thunders of applause. The iron nose was made and fitted 
to the iron eye-pieces, and my friend appeared on the fighting 
ground looking like a figure of Kladderadatsch disguised as Arminius. 
He wore out two iron noses while he remained in the Korps, but 
the destruction of the enemy's weapons more than counterbalanced 
this trifling expense. When he left, his armour was attached to 
a life-sized photograph of his head, which hangs to this day 
above two crossed rapiers in the Kneipe. That is the history of 
the man with the iron nose/ 

There had been much half-suppressed laughter while Rex was 
telling his story, and when he had finished, the students roared 
with delight. Rex had never before given himself so much trouble 
to amuse them, and the effect of his narrative was immense. 

' He talks as if he knew something about it,' said one, nudging 
his neighbour. 

' Perhaps he helped to wear out the nose,' answered the other 
still laughing. 

'A health to you all,' cried Rex, draining his full measure. 
'And may none of you parry carte with the proboscis,' he added, 
as he set down the empty cup. 

' Ha ! That is a good thing ! ' laughed the voice of the burly 
second as he entered the room, his face beaming with delight. 
' Out with the foxes, there is business here for a few minutes.' 

The foxes, who were not privileged to hear the deliberations of 
their elders upon such grave matters, rose together and filed out, 
carrying their pipes and drinking-cups with them. Then the second 
sat down in his vacant place. 

' Well ? ' asked Greif. < Is it all settled.' 

' Yes. The cattle wanted to fight you first. I said the Phil- 
istine insisted excuse me, no offence. Good. Now that was all. 7 

The second buried his nose in a foaming tankard. 

' Is it for to-morrow morning ? ' asked Rex calmly. 

' Palmengarten, back entrance, four sharp.' 

' What do you mean ? ' asked Greif. ' Are we to fight in the 
Palmengarten, in the restaurant ? ' 

The second nodded, and lighted his pipe. 

' Poetic,  he observed. 4 Marble floor fountain playing palm 
trees in background.' 



 

' Then we must go there at that hour so as not to be seen ? ' 

'The Poodle thinks it is at Schneckenwinkel, and is going 
out by the early train to lie in wait/ chuckled the burly student. 
' There he will sit all the morning like a sparrow limed on a twig.' 

' Have we any other pairs ? ' asked Greif absently. 

' Three others. Two foxes and Hollenstein. He is gone to bed 
and I am going to send the foxes after him. We can make a night 
of it, if you like.' 

' I will stay with you,' said Rex, who seemed jovially inclined. 

Neither Greif nor the second thought it their business to suggest 
that their combatant had better get some rest before the battle. 
When two o'clock struck, Rex was teaching them all a new song, 
which was not in the book, his clear strong voice ringing out 
steadily and tunefully through the smoky chamber, his smooth 
complexion neither flushed nor pale from the night's carousal, his 
stony eyes as colourless and forbidding, as his smile was genial 
and unaffected. 

As they rose to go, he caught sight of a huge silver-mounted 
horn that hung behind his chair. 

' I will drink that out to-morrow night, with your permission,' 
he said with a light laugh. 

' Bravo ! ' shouted the excited chorus. 

'He is a little drunk,' whispered the student whom Bauer had 
wounded, addressing his neighbour. 

' Or a boaster, who will back down the floor,' answered the 
other shrugging his shoulders. 

' I hope you may do it,' said the first speaker aloud and turning 
to Rex. ' If you do, I will empty it after you to your health, and 
so will every Swabian here.' 

'Ay, that will we!' exclaimed Greif, and the others joined 
readily in the promise. Seeing how probable it was that by the 
next evening Rex would be in bed, with a bag of ice on his head, 
it was not likely that they would be called upon to perform the 
feat. 

' It is a beer-oath then ! ' said Rex. ' Let us go and fight.' 

And they filed out into the narrow street, silently and quietly,
