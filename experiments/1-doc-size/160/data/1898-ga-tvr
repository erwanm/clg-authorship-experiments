" If we only don't meet a bear," thought 
Roldan, who dared not speak lest his voice 
should shake courage and terrors apart. 

It was midnight when Adan announced 
with what emphasis was left in him, 

" We are lost." 




Roldan answered through his teeth : 
" Yes, but I think I hear the creek. When 
we find that, all we have to do is to follow 
it south." 

" My heart is in the South," muttered 
Adan. " We might follow that." 

" I am ashamed of you," said Roldan, 
with a lofty scorn which was good for five 
words and no more. 

It was a half hour later that they stood 
upon the high bank of the creek and looked 
gratefully up at the broad strip of night 
light. After the dense shadows of the 
forest the cold light of stars seemed more 
radiant than noon-day. 

" We cannot follow along the bank for 
more than a little way at a time, on 
account of the ferns and brush," said Roldan. 
" We should walk three times the distance, 
and perhaps get lost again. I am going 
to wade. Will you ? " 

" Madre de dios ! And get rheumatism ? 
My teeth clack together at the thought." 

" You will not be able to keep still long 
enough to get rheumatism, my friend. By 
the grace of Mary we shall be on horse- 
back all day to-morrow. The water is not 
a foot deep, and the chill only lasts a 
moment. Take off your boots." 

" What is left of them," muttered Adan. 
But they were better than no boots, and 
he took them off, and slung them round 
his neck. Roldan scrambled down the 
bank and plunged into the creek. Adan, 
after a moment's hesitation, followed with 
audible reluctance. He thrust the tip of 
one foot into the icy water, withdrew it 
with a shout, tried the other; then seeing 
that Roldan was splashing far ahead, 
jumped in with both feet and ran along 
the slippery rocks, wondering when the 
change of temperature would occur. His 
teeth clattered loudly. He pulled in and 
executed a war-dance on the stones, then 
sat down on a fallen boulder and rubbed 
his feet violently. Roldan kept steadily 
on, mindful of his dignity as leader; but 
only as Adan joined him had his teeth 
ceased from clattering and the warmth 
crawled back to his feet. 

Cold, hungry, inexpressibly weary, the 
boys plodded on, sometimes in the clear 
light of stars, sometimes under the chill 
blackness of meeting trees. Fish and 
other slimy things darted across their feet ; 
they stepped to their waists into more 
than one treacherous pool. The dark 
blue of the sky had turned to grey when 
Roldan raised his arm and pointed to a 
squat dark object on the summit of the 
cliff. 

"A hut," he said. " We are at the 
pueblo." 

The boys crawled softly up the almost 
perpendicular bank and peered over the 
edge. To all appearances the pueblo was 
deserted. If the soldiers were there 
and their horses were not they slept 
within the huts. The animal instinct, so 
bravely repressed, overcame the 
adventurers. They ran across the open to the hut 
where the food was kept, and ate for fifteen 
minutes without speaking or taking the 
trouble to hide themselves.

WHEN they had satisfied their ap 
petites they made two large pack 
ages of dried meat and fruit, tying them 
securely with straw to their right arms: 
saddle-bags there were none. 

" Not a horse," whispered Adan. " Do 
you think the soldiers have gone ? " 

" I think they are lost, and as they did 
not stop to tie their horses when they 
started after us, they won't see them again 
until they get back to camp. Come." 

Roldan peered cautiously into each of 
the huts in turn ; all were empty. Then 
the boys started for the corral, which the 
soldiers would not have passed either on 
their way to the pueblo or in pursuit of the 
runaways. They found the Indians in 
charge sound asleep in their hut, and did 
not think it worth while to awaken them. 
The two mustangs they led forth, vicious 
brutes at best, were very restless from 
prolonged inactivity. Roldan's submitted to 
the saddle, but bolted as soon as he felt 
a determined pair of legs about his sides ; 
and as our adventurer had neither whip 
nor spurs, all he could do was to hang on 
and shout to Adan to follow close. This 
was the only thing that Adan's mustang 
was willing to do, and the boys were borne 
blindly on, down one path, up another, 
plunging deeper into the black recesses of 
the forest until they knew no more of their 
whereabouts than if they had dropped from 
another sphere. 

After many weary miles the mustangs 
slackened, and the boys dismounted and 
cut two slender but stinging whips. After 
that they rose once more to the proud 
supremacy of man over brute. But the 
situation was full of peril. They were 
hopelessly lost, the redwoods were the 
home of the grizzly and the panther, and 
they might come upon the soldiers at any 
moment. But there was nothing to do 
but to ride on, and at least they had horses 
and food. 

They descended whenever descent was 
possible, for at the foot of the mountain 
lay the open valley ; but there were no 
trails; in all likelihood they were where 
no man, red or white, had ever been before ; 
they had to force their way where the 
brusn was thinnest, and as often their
