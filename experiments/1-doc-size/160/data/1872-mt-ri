The Book op Mormon: an account -wtiitten by the Hand op Mor- 
mon, UPON Plates taken from the Plates op Nephi. 
Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, 
and also of the Lamanites ; written to the Lamanites, vvho are a remnant of 
the House of Israel ; and also to Jew and Gentile ; written by way of com- 
mandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. Written 
nd sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed ; 
to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof ; 
sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in 
due time by the way of Gentile ; the interpretation thereof by the gift of 
•God. An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also ; which is a 
record of the people of Jared ; who were scattered at the time the Lord 
confounded the language of the people when they were building a tower to 
et to Heaven. 

" Hid up " is good. And so is " wherefore" — though why 
'' wherefore" ? Any other word would have answered as well 
- — though in truth it would not have sounded so Scriptural. 

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto whom 
this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the Father, and 
our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which 
is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their breth- 
ren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which 
hath been spoken ; and we also know that they have been translated by the 
gift and power of God, for His voice hath declared it unto us ; wherefore 
we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we 
have seen the engravings which are upon the plates ; and they have been 
shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with 
words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he 
brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and 
the engravings thereon ; and we know that it is by the grace of God the 
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that 
these things are true ; and it is marvellous in our eyes ; nevertlieless the 
voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it ; where- 
fore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of 
these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid 
our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the 
judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens. 
And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, 
which is one God. Amen.

Some people have to have a world of evidence before they 
can come anywhere in the neighborhood of believing any- 
thing ; but for me, when a man tells me that he has " seen the 
engravings which are upon the plates," and not only that, but 
an angel was there at the time, and saw him see them, and 
probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the road to 
conviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before 
or not, and even if I do not know the name of the angel, or 
his nationality either. 
Next is this : 

AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OP EIGHT WITNESSES. 

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto whom 
this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of this work, 
has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the 
appearance of gold ; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has trans- 
lated, we did handle with our hands ; and we also saw the engravings 
thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious 
workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said 
Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a 
surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. 
And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which 
we have seen ; and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

And when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight 
men, be they grammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell 
me that they have seen the plates too; and not only seen 
those plates but " hefted " them, I am convinced. I could not 
feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family 
had testified. 

The Mormon Bible consists of fifteen " books " — being the 
books of Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zenifi", Alma, 
Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two " books " of Mormon, and three 
of Nephi. 

In the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Tes- 
tament, which gives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem 
of the " children of Lehi " ; and it goes on to tell of their 
wanderings in the wilderness, during eight years, and their 
supernatural protection by one of their number, a party by the 
name of Nephi. They finally reached the land of " Bounti- 
ful," and camped by the sea. After they had remained there 
" for the space of many days " — which is more Scriptural than 
definite — Nephi was commanded from on high to build a ship 
wherein to " carry the people across the waters." He traves- 
tied Noah's ark — but he obeyed orders in the matter of the 
plan. He finished the ship in a single day, while his breth- 
ren stood by and made fun of it — and of him, too — " saying, 
our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship." 
They did not wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe 
or nation sailed the next day. Then a bit of genuine nature 
cropped out, and is revealed by outspoken Nephi with Script- 
ural frankness — they all got on a spree ! They, " and also 
their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch that 
they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much 
rudeness ; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness." 

Nephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings ; but they 
tied him neck and heels, and went on with their lark. But 
observe how Nephi the prophet circumvented them by the aid 
of the invisible powers : 

And it came to pass that after they had hound me, insomuch that I could 
not move, the compass, which had heen prepared of the Lord, did cease to 
work ; wherefore, they  knew not whither they should steer the ship, inso- 
much that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest, and 
we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days ; and they 
began to be frightened exceedinglj-, lest they should be drowned in the sea ; 
nevertheless they did not loose me. And on the fourth day, which we had 
been driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore. 

And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the 
depths of the sea. 

Then they  untied him. 

And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, 
and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed 
unto the Lord ; and after I had prayed, the winds did cease, and the storm 
did cease, and there was a great calm. 


THE MIRACULOUS COMPASS. 

Equipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have 
had the advantage of !N'oah. 
Their voyage was toward a "promised land" — the only 
name they give it. They reached it in safety. 

Polygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and 
was added by Brigham Yonng after Joseph Smith's death. 
Before that, it was regarded as an " abomination." This verso 
from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter II. of the book of 
Jacob : 

For behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in iniquity ; 
they understand not the Scriptures ; for they seek to excuse themselves in 
committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concern- 
ing David, and Solomon his son. Behold, David and Solomon truly had 
many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable oefore me, saith 
the Lord ; wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out 
of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up
