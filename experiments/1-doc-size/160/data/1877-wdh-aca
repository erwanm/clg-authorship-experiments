Cummings : " I won't conceal my belief that he 
will think so. But there can be no question with 
him when " 

General Wyatt : " When you tell him our 
story ? " After a moment : u Yes, he has a right 
to know it as the rest of the world knows it. 
You must tell him, sir." 

Cummings, gently : " No, he need know nothing 
beyond the fact of this resemblance to some one 
painfully associated with your past lives. He is 



 

a man whose real tenderness of heart would revolt 
from knowledge that could inflict further sorrow 
upon you." 

General Wyatt : " Sir, will you convey to this 
friend of yours an old man's very humble apology, 
and sincere prayer for his forgiveness ? " 

Cummings : " He will not exact anything of 
that sort. The evidence of misunderstanding will 
be clear to Mm at a word from me." 

General Wyatt : " But he has a right to this ex- 
planation from my own lips, and Sir, I am 
culpably weak. But now that I have missed see- 
ing him here, I confess that I would willingly 
avoid meeting him. The mere sound of his voice, 
as I heard it before I saw him, in first coming upon 
you, was enough to madden me. Can you excuse 
my senseless dereliction to him ?" 

Cummings : " I will answer for him." 

General Wyatt : " Thanks. It seems monstrous 
that I should be asking and accepting these great 
favors. But you are doing a deed of charity to a 
helpless man utterly beggared in pride." He 
chokes with emotion, and does not speak for a mo- 



 

merit. " Your friend is also he is not also a 
clergyman ? " 

Cummings, smiling : " No. He is a painter." 

General Wyatt : " Is he a man of note ? Succes- 
ful in his profession ? " 

Cummings : " Not yet. But that is certain to 
come." 

General Wyatt : " He is poor ? " 

Cammings : " He is a young painter." 

General Wyatt : " Sir, excuse me. Had he 
planned to remain here some time, yet ? " 

Cummings, reluctantly : " He has been sketch- 
ing here. He had expected to stay through Octo- 
ber." 

General Wyatt: "You make the sacrifice hard 
to accept I beg your pardon ! But I must ac- 
cept it. I am bound hand and foot." 

Cummings : " I am sorry to have been obliged to 
tell you this." 

General Wyatt : " I obliged you, sir ; I obliged 
you. Give me your advice, sir; you know your 
friend. What shall I do ? I am not rich. I don't 
belong to a branch of the government service in 



 

which people enrich themselves. But I have my 
pay ; and if your friend could sell me the pictures 
he 's been painting here " 

Gummings : " That 's quite impossible. There 
is no form in which I could propose such a thing to 
a man of his generous pride." 

General Wyatt : " Well, then, sir, I must satisfy 
myself as I can to remain his debtor. Will you 
kindly undertake to tell him ? " 

An Elderly Serving- Woman, who appears timidly 
and anxiously at the right-hand door : " General 
Wyatt." 

General Wyatt, with a start: "Yes, Mary! 
Well?" 

Mary, in vanishing: "Mrs. Wyatt wishes to 
speak with you." 

General Wyatt, going up to Cummings : " I 
must go, sir. I leave unsaid what I cannot even 
try to say." He offers his hand. 

Cummings, grasping the proffered hand: "Every- 
thing is understood." But as Mr. Cummings re- 
turns from following General Wyatt to the door, 
his face does not confirm the entire security of his 



 

words. He looks anxious and perturbed, and 
when he has taken up his hat and stick, he stands 
pondering absent-mindedly. At last he puts on his 
hat and starts briskly toward the door. Before 
he reaches it, he encounters Bartlett, who advances 
abruptly into the room. "Oh! I was going to 
look for you." 



VI. 

CUMMINGS and BARTLETT. 

Bartlett, sulkily: "Were you?" He walks, 
without looking at Cummings, to where his paint- 
er's paraphernalia are lying, and begins to pick 
them up. 

Cummings: "Yes." In great embarrassment: 
" Bartlett, General Wyatt has been here." 

Bartlett, without looking round : " Who is Gen- 
eral Wyatt?" 

Cummings: "I mean the gentleman who 
whom you wouldn't wait to see." 

Bartlett: "Urn!" He has gathered the things 
into his arms, and is about to leave the room. 

Cummings, in great distress: "Bartlett, Bart- 
lett! Don't go! I implore you, if you have any 
regard for me whatever, to hear what I have to 
say. It's boyish, it's cruel, it's cowardly to be- 
have as you 're doing ! "
