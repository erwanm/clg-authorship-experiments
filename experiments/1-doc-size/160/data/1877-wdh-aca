V. 

CONSTANCE and MRS. WYATT ; then BARTLETT. 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Oh, Constance ! How can you 
treat your father so coldly ? You will suffer some 
day for the pain you give him ! " 

Constance : " Suffer ? No, I 'm past that. I Ve 
exhausted my power of suffering."  

Mrs. Wyatt: "You haven't exhausted your 
power of making others suffer." 

Constance, crouching listlessly down upon the 
sofa: "I told you that I lived only to give pain. 
But it 's my fate, not my will. Nothing but that 
can excuse me." 

Mrs. Wyatt, wringing her hands : " Oh, oh ! Well, 
then, give me pain if you must torment somebody. 
But spare your father, spare the heart that loves 
you so tenderly, you unhappy girl." 

Constance, with hardness : " Whenever I see 



 

papa, my first thought is, If he had not been so 
harsh and severe, it might never have happened ! 
What can I care for his loving me when he hated 
him ? Oh, I will do my duty, mother ; I will 
obey ; I have obeyed, and I know how. Papa 
can't demand anything of me now that isn't easy. 
I have forgiven everything, and if you give me 
time I can forget. I have forgotten. I have been 
laughing at something so foolish, it ought to make 
me cry for shame." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Constance, you try me beyond all 
endurance ! You talk of forgiving, you talk of 
forgetting, you talk of that wretch ! Forgive him, 
forget him, if you can. If he had been half a man, 
if he had ever cared a tithe as much for you as for 
himself, all the hate of all the fathers in the world 
could not have driven him from you. You talk of 
obeying " 

Mary, the serving woman, flying into the room : 
" Oh, please, Mrs. Wyatt ! There are four men 
carrying somebody up the hill. And General Wy- 
att just went down, and I can't see him anywhere, 
and " 



 

Mrs. Wyatt : " You 're crazy, Mary ! He hasn't 
been gone a moment ; there isn't time ; it can't be 
he ! " Mrs. "Wyatt rushes to the gallery that over- 
looks the road to verify her hope or fear, and then 
out of one of the doors into the corridor, while 
Constance springs frantically to her feet and runs 
toward the other door. 

Constance : " Oh, yes, yes ! It 's papa ! It 's 
my dear, good, kind papa ! He 's dead ; he 's 
drowned ; I drove him away ; I murdered him ! 
Ah-h-h-h!" She shrinks back with a shriek at 
sight of Bartlett, whose excited face appears at the 
door : " Go ! It was you, you who made me hate 
my father! You made me kill him and now I 
abhor you! I" 

Bartlett: "Wait! Hold on! Wfcat is it all?" 

Constance : " Oh, forgive me ! I didn't mean 
I didn't know it was you, sir ! But where is he? 
Oh, take me to him! Is he dead?" She seizes his 
arm, and clings to it trembling. 

Bartlett: "Dead? No, he isn't dead. He was 
knocked over by a team coming behind him down 
the hill, and was slightly bi*uised. There 's no 



 

cause for alarm. He sent me to tell you ; they 've 
carried him to your rooms." 

Constance: "Oh, thank Heaven!" She bows 
her head with a sob, upon his shoulder, and then 
lifts her tearful eyes to his : " Help me to get to 
him ! I am weak." She totters and Bartlett me- 
chanically passes a supporting arm about her. 
"Help me, and don't don't leave me!" She 
moves with him a few paces toward the door, her 
head drooping; but all at once she raises her face 
again, stares at him, stiffly releases .herself, and with 
a long look of reproach walks proudly away to 
the other door, by which she vanishes without a 
word. 

Bartlett) remaining planted, with a bewildered 
glance at his empty arm : " Well, I wonder who 
and what and where I am ! " 



III. 

NOT AT ALL LIKE. 



BARTLETT and CUMMINGS. 

Bartlett : " Six weeks since you were here ? I 
shouldn't have thought that." Bartlett's easel 
stands before the window, in the hotel parlor ; he 
has laid a tint upon the canvas, and has retired a 
few paces for the effect, his palette and mahl-stick 
in hand, and his head carried at a critical angle. 
Cummings, who has been doing the duty of art- 
culture by the picture, regards it with renewed in- 
terest. Bartlett resumes his work : " Pretty good, 
Cummings ? " 

Cummings : " Capital ! The blue of that dis- 
tance " 

Bartlett with a burlesque sigh : " Ah, I looked 
into my heart and painted for that! Well, you 
find me still here, Cummings, and apparently more 
at home than ever. The landlord has devoted this 



 

parlor to the cause of art, makes the transients 
use the lower parlor, now, and we have this all 
to ourselves: Miss Wyatt sketches, you know. 
Her mother brings her sewing, and the General his 
bruises ; he hasn't quite scrambled up, yet, from 
that little knock-down of his ; a man doesn't, at 
his time of life, I believe ; and we make this our 
family-room ; and a very queer family we are ! 
Fine old fellow, the General ; he 's behaved himself 
since his accident like a disabled angel, and hasn't 
sworn, well, anything worth speaking of. Yes, 
here I am. I suppose it 's all right, but for all I 
know it may be all wrong." Bartlett sighs in un-
