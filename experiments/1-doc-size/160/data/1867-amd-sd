And Hope, unconscious of this, made herself sweeter 
every day. For him, alone. As a little girl, pleasing 
him had been her first duty. Now it grew into some- 
tiring tenderer. I do not know as she understood her- 
self why his approbation was so much to her, why she 
treasured every smile, why she spurred up Joe's latent 
energies to make home more attractive. 

Hope Vennard's nature had that delicate finish, call 
it tact, if you will, though that hardly expresses it, the 
rare faculty of understanding and meeting the moods of 
another. Joe lacked this entirely ! Some things she 
avoided from a sort of dumb terror, like admitting her 
knowledge of Stephen's secret ; but in so many respects 



 

she was deficient in that womanly adaptiveness that 
renders some so charming ! More than once she had 
been made absolutely cross and miserable by its exercise 
in Hope. And through these years she had come to 
perceive that her vague dreams respecting Stephen 
could never be reality. She could see the inharmonious- 
ness of their natures that while his had broadened and 
deepened, while he had grown to be the perfect gentle- 
man, she had taken on few new graces. Hope played 
and sang to him ; when she met with a choice little 
poem, she read it aloud, or, better still, repeated it in 
her rich, enchanting tones, just at twilight, when it was 
most effective. She embroidered slippers, or put his 
initials in the corners of pocket handkerchiefs, with her 
dainty needle, that seemed endowed with magic. If she 
twined a flower in her hair, it drooped in the most 
exquisite manner. Everything she touched grew lovelier 
from the contact. 

And then she was in the first flush of girlhood, Joe 
fading in her" thirties. Yet it must be confessed the 
years improved her, or else Hope's influence. I think 
the young girl, in the lavish generosity of her nature, 
would have endowed Joe with half her beauty, and half 
her gifts, had such a thing been possible. As it was, 
she always brought her out into the best light, when Joe 
was not sullen and ungracious, as she never could be 
long with Hope. 



 

And her eyes at last saw what both were unconscious 
of betraying. There had always been a little dull 
jealousy regarding Hope. Yet Stephen seldom petted 
her as one naturally might a child, and Hope had been 
shy in this one respect, though free enough in all others. 
But the certainty had come gradually upon Joe. first 
that Stephen could never love her, and then that he 
loved another. It roused her to a sort of angry despera- 
tion. How dared Stephen think of the child, when his 
hand was red with the father's blood ! 

For all this time the belief had clung stubbornly to 
Joe that she alone had solved the mystery. I am not 
sure but it rendered her the more persistently tender 
towards him, knowing there was one thing that his new 
life and position could never efface, a deed that brought 
him down to the lowest level. She had received Hope 
the more kindly because she felt Stephen owed her some 
amends, and she was willing to share his burden. But 
that any warmer interest should exist, seemed monstrous 
even to her narrow mind. 

Yet the years had been very pleasant to them all, 
interspersed with an occasional visit to New York, the 
first of which had been the grandest holiday in Joe's life. 
Many quiet little home pleasures had brightened the 
time, for Stephen had truly endeavored to make them 
both happy. He had meant to devote his whole life to 
this object. Every indulgence was lavished upon Hope. 



 

If she had so willed, she might have reigned a queen. 
She was neither imperious nor selfish ; she liked better 
to give than to receive ; and since in so many things she 
must be a recipient, she gave daily of her abundant 
sweetness. 

And so they came around to March to a time that 
was always a little festival. They were rather late at 
breakfast, for Joe had been suffering from a severe cold 
for several days. As Stephen rose from the table he 
said, 

"Hope, run up to my room and bring me a roll of 
drawings lying on my desk. I forgot them." 

Hope was off like a flash, up to the apartment before 
Joe had found the energy to say, 

"Why, you laid them in the book-case last night, 
Stephen, after you finished the model." 

" Did I ? I believe you're right, though ; " and as he 
went to the sitting-room, he called out, "They're down 
here, Hope." 

She met him at the doorway, flushed and smiling. 
He was slowly buttoning his coat. 

" Too bad ! " he began, with a smile. "I'm growing 
old and forgetful." 

"Are you?" There was a sort of merry light in her 
face. 

"Do you know what day it is?" he asked. 

"My birthday." 



 

"And what do you want, girlie? I ought to have 
thought sooner, and given you a party." 

" Next year you may. I shall be a woman grown 
then. So don't be too lavish, for I have a fancy I shall 
live to be a venerable dame, and there's a many birth- 
days from seventeen to seventy." 

" Seventeen ! " he repeated, looking her over. Hard- 
ly medium size, slender and round, with pliant, shapely 
limbs, and the fair face full of softest pencillings. How 
wonderfully beautiful it was ! The tiny veins filling 
with the lightest emotion, making her flush with a 
thought ; the tender, luminous eyes ; and the ripe, full 
mouth inviting caresses with its dainty curves. Oh, if 
she could be his ! He drew a long, long breath. 

" Does it frighten you the prospect of my growing 
old ? You look so grave." 

He placed both arms around her, and, yielding to the 
half-unconscious pressure, her head sunk upon his 
breast. 

"No, it was not that." His voice had a strange, 
strangled sound, and then he paused for many seconds. 

" Something came in my mind just then a subject 
that has troubled me sorely. Help me to decide, 
Hope." 

" If I can."
