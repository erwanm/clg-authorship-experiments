" ' I do said I, coolly, though I didn't feel as cool as 
I.appeared. 

"'Ha!' he exclaimed, in surprise. 'What is it?' 

" ' It is the Red Rover said I, making believe to be 
unconcerned. . 

"'And are you acquainted with its character?' said 
the captain, with another of his sharp looks. 

" ' I believe so,' said I. 

" ' Name it.' 

" ' I think it is a pirate,' said I, not moving a muscle. 

" ' Ha ! ' he exclaimed, looking at me rather curiously. 
' Are you not afraid to find yourself on board a pirate?' 

" ' Why should I be ? ' I answered. ' But for you, I 
should have died on the hen-coop, and I suppose, if you 
had meant to take away my life, you wouldn't have 
taken the trouble to save me, since death was certain.' 

'"A bold fellow!' said the captain, aside, to the 
mate. He spoke in the Spanish language, but I had 
managed to pick up some odd phrases in that lingo, so 
I knew what he was driving at. The mate seemed to 
agree, and they talked a little more. I didn't under- 
stand, but guessed it was about me. 

" The pirate captain, after a short confab with the 
mate, turned round, and spoke to me. ' Well, my man,' 
said he, ' I don't mind telling you that you've hit the 
mark in guessing that this is the Red Rover, and a pirate. 
I believe she has made something of a reputation for 
herself,' he added, proudly. 

" I bowed. 

" ' Now I have a proposal to make to you. We're 
rather short-handed. We need two or three brave fel- 
lows, and I am inclined to think, from your bearing, 



 





that you will suit us. Now, if you would like it, yon 
shall be admitted to equal privileges with the rest of the 
crew, with an equal share of whatever booty we manage 
to pick up, and that, I may tell you, is not small. Here, 
Roderigo, step forward, and tell this man how much 
your share was last year.' 

" Roderigo, a villanous-looking fellow, stepped for- 
ward, and answered, ' Nearly two thousand dollars in 
goods and money.' 

" ' You see, then, what are the inducements. Will 
you join us or not? ' 

" Now I very well knew what the consequences of my 
refusal would be, so I replied, without a moment's liesi- 
tation, ' I will.'" 

"What, did you become a pirate?" asked Charlie, 
horror-struck. 

" Pretty much in the same way that you became a 
sailor, my lad ; because I couldn't help it." 

"And did you join in robbing vessels, and killing all 
onboard?" 

"Hold OQ, my lad; you're a little too fast forme. 
You'll know in due time. The pirate captain seemed 
pleased with my promptness, and made me sign the 
books. I should have given a wrong name, only I had 
given the right one when I was hailed, though, for that 
matter. Sturdy isn't my right name. The captain told 
me, in a very polite sort of way, that if I should under- 
take to play them false, or interfere with them in any 
way, I should be pitched overboard. As this threat did 
not seem to trouble me much, he seemed to be satisfied 
that it was all right with me. In the course of a day or ' 
two, I got acquainted with the crew. They were mostly 

 



 

Spaniards, bat there was a sprinkling of other nations, 
â€” French, Danes, Germans, and one Englishman." 

" Were there any Yankees? " 

" No, Tm proud to say there wasn't one except my- 
self, and I wasn't there of my own free will. Piracy 
doesn't chime in with our Yankee notions, and it's my 
belief you'll find precious few Ml-blooded Yankees that 
are engaged in the business." 

"How did you get out of their clutches?" asked 
Charlie. 

'' That's what Fm coming to by and by. For a few 
days we didn't meet a vessel, or, at least, one that was 
alona, and so would do to attack. I was glad of that, 
for I was ready enough to do my duty on board the . 
ship, but I knew that, just as soon as we met a vessel, I 
should be expected to do my share of the fighting, and" 
it went against my grain to engage in any such villain- 
ous business as that. However, I thought I wouldn't 
borrow trouble, but wait till it came, and then I could 
decide what to do. 

"At last I heard the cry I so much dreaded, 'Sail 
ho ! ' from one of the crew, who had been sent aloft to 
give notice of an approaching vessel. 

" 'Where away?' shouted the pirate captain. 

" ' To the eastward.' 

" Orders were at once given to change the course of 
the vessel, and to make for the stranger. As soon as 
she saw us she made every effort to get away, but the 
Bed Rover was too swift for her. When we got within 
a short distance, I made out the vessel to be the Sally 
. Ann, which had left port about the time the Peregrine 
did. I knew some of those on board very well, and the 
captain was an old school-mate of mine. 

" ' What would they think,' I couldn't help saying to 
myself, with a groan, ' if they knew their old messmate 
was regularly enrolled among the crew of the pirate 
that is o7erhauling them? ' " 


Bill Sturdy paused to take a whiff at his pipe, and 
then resumed his story, in which Charlie manifested no 
slight interest. 

" I was taken all aback," he continued, " when I 
found it was the Sally Ann I was expected to join hands 
with the pirates against. I couldn't help thinking of 
tlie many pleasant hours I had spent on board that ves- 
sel, chatting and spinning yarns with the crew. What 
to do I didn't know. 

" The pirates were already clearing for action, and 
all seemed as busy as bees. You ought to have seen the
