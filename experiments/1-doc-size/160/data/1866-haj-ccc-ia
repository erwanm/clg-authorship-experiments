from the cabin and began to pace the deck." 

The captain assented. 

'' As you passed I observed one of the crew take a 
hasty glance at your finger. I looked also, and saw 
that you were not wearing your ring as usual." 

"Well?" 

" The sailor that I mentioned just now." 

"Whow she?" 

" I would rather not mention his name just at present  
unless you insist upon it." 

The captain did not insist, and Sturdy proceeded. 





'' I thought I would just keep my eyes open, and see 
what followed. Pretty soon the sailor I spoke of looked 
about him to see if he was unnoticed, and crept slyly 
down below. A little later he came up and went to 
work again." 

"Was that all?'' 

" It was not," answered Sturdy. " He kept at work 
about ten minutes longer, and then stole towards the 
forecastle with the same secrecy as before. I should 
have followed him down, but I thought he would notice 
me. My mind misgave me that he was in some mis- 
chief. I determined I would remember what happened, 
and if anything turned up, I should know how it came 
about." 

'' And what do you make of all this?" said Eandall, 
sneering. " To my mind it is a foolish story, and, even 
if true, aipounts to nothing." 

" I'll tell you what I think, and am about sure of, Mr. 
Randall," said Bill, without betraying a particle of ex- 
citement, but continuing to speak with the same calm 
composure as before, "I believe that man in the first 
place stole the captain's ring, and then went and put it 
into the lad's chest, in order that it might be found 
there, and the guilt fixed on him." 

This assertion made a sensation among the crew, and 
there was a general feeling that Charlie was innocent. 

" Who is this man of whom you have been speak- 
ing? " said the captain. 

" I don't need to name Mm," said Bill. " I don't 
need even to look at him. If you will look around you, 
Captain Brace, you can tell by his looks who the man is 



 



 

that has hatched this wicked plot against an innocent 
boy." 

Instantly the 'eyes of all, as if by some confmon im- 
pulse, were fixed upon the form of Antonio, who, con- 
fused, thunderstruck by the minute detail of his move- 
ments, which he had supposed unnoticed by any one, 
now stood with his face alternately flushing and paling, 
looking the very picture of confession and detected guilt. 

Unable to bear the glances fixed upon hifti, he ex- 
claimed, in a voice hoarse with passion, " It is false. I 
never did it." 

" No one has accused you that I know of," said Bill 
Sturdy, coolly. '' Leastways, nobody that I know of, 
excepting yourself, and your face is enough to do that. 
However, I don't mind saying that you are the man I 
mean. If Captain Brace will take the trouble to re- 
member, you are the first one that thought of searching 
for the ring, and told him falsely that you had seen it in 
the hands of that lad there. Then again, when the 
chest had been searched, and the ring couldn't be found, 
you came forward and offered to look for it yourself, and 
finally you did find it. That's all I've got to say, only, 
if you are not the real thief I am a liar, and so is that 
face of yours." 

Carried away by his rage, Antonio, forgetting the 

pruden9e which his past experience might have taught 

him, threw himself suddenly upon. Bill Sturdy, and 

nearly succeeded in laying him prostrate upon the 

deck. 





 



XXYI. 

A STORM BREWING. 

Antonio's assault was so unexpected that Bill Sturdy, 
being, of course, quite, unprepared for it, staggered and 
seemed about to fall. But, as, one who slips upon the 
ice instinctively makes an effort to preserve his equi- 
librium, so Sturdy immediately recovered from the mo- 
mentary disadvantage, and seizing Antonio with both 
hands threw him to the deck without any great apparent 
effort. 

Probably if Antonio had gained the advantage, Cap- 
tain Brace would have been in no haste to put a stop to 
the conflict. As it was, his brows knit with anger as 
he exclaimed, in a stentorian voice, — 

" Stop this fighting, you lubbers ! Don't you know 
better the respect which is due to my presence, you 
— rascals ! I'll let you know that I am not to be 
insulted on my own deck." 

" It wasn't a fight of my seeking. Captain Brace' 
said Bill, coolly. " I ain't disposed to be quarrelsome, 
and I gness he won't want to try it again immediately." 

As he said this he glanced at Antonio, who, sorely 
bruised by the fall, was slowly rising from the deck, and 

slinking away with a crestfallen and malignant look. 
Had he not been moved by an uncontrollable impulse 
of rage and disappointment, he would scarcely have 
ventured upon this open attack, knowing, as had been 
 ncontestably proved, that he was no match for the 
Herculean strength of Bill Sturdy. 

" Silence ! " roared the captain, in answer to Bill's 
vindication of himself. " One would think from your 
manner that you were the captain of .this ship instead 
of me." 

" If I were the captain," said Bill, bluntly, '' I'd have 
that man," pointing to Antonio, " put ashore at the first
