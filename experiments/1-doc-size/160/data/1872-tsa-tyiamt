She stayed a couple of weeks, and came back 
stronger and brighter. Her father was much elated 
by the result, and wanted to go with her to the moun 
tains. But she begged so not to be taken away 
again that he had not the heart to compel her. 

After that she led a quiet, dreamy sort of life. 
She read but little. Books seemed to disturb her. 
Of her two younger brothers she was very fond, and 
had them with her a great deal. 

So it went on for another year. Then a new life 
began to awaken in her. She had become interested 
in some poor people living near by, and in her visits 
to their houses met one day a lady who was drawn 
toward her at once. This lady, a member of one of 
the churches, was devoting herself to works of char 
ity among the poor. She saw in Maggy all the qual 
ities of mind and heart needed for a companion and 
helper, while Maggy found in her a friend and guide 
who could lead her into new paths of life and lift 
her mind into more peaceful regions than it had ever 
been able alone to reach. 



 

Through the influence of this lady, Maggy was 
led to join the church and to become a Sunday- 
school teacher. 

Lloyd told me about it one day with a pleased 
manner, at which I could not but wonder, seeing 
that our interests were all on the other side. 

" It won t work well," I answered. 

" Why not ?" he asked. 

" Can t you see ? It won t be a month before 
every teacher and every scholar in the school will 
know that her father keeps a liquor-saloon." 

" Confound you, Hiram ! Haven t you anything 
else to say?" An angry flush reddened Lloyd 's 
face as he spoke. " And suppose they do know it, 
what then ?" 

" It won t be long before some good Christian 
among them will draw back the skirts of her gar 
ment as she passes, lest the touch be pollution." 

" Christian ! Faugh ! Better say Pharisee !" 

" Christian or Pharisee, it will be all the same to 
Maggy," I returned. 

I had troubled the waters of his spirit. The light 
went out of his face ; he looked very sober. 

"And then," I continued, "it won t be a great 
while after that before some other good and wise 
Christian brother or sister will feel moved to talk 
with her about the iniquity of your business, and 
urge her to use her influence to get you to abandon 
it." 

" Good heavens !" Lloyd ejaculated, beginning to 



 

walk about and show considerable agitation. " No, 
no, Hiram. I don 't  believe any one would be so 
thoughtless and cruel. Why, it would almost kill 
the poor child. She 'd never hold up her head 
among people again." 

" I'm sorry she 's got into this thing, Tom," I replied, speaking seriously. " It can t go on long. 
You must look for a break at any time, and be pre 
pared for it. Sunday-schools and churches are not 
in our line, and Sunday-school and church people 
don 't  tolerate us. They re down on us in every way 
set us over to the devil 's side and there is nothing 
too bad for them to say about us. No, Tom. It 
isn 't the place for one like Maggy. She isn 't strong 
enough to bear what will surely come upon her. 
Just imagine some cur of a boy looking up into her 
face and saying, 

" Doesn 't your father sell rum ? " 

Lloyd fairly caught his breath and seemed to 
stagger back as I said this, while he grew dark with 
anger and pain. 

" But I see no help for it," I went on. " Poor 
thing ! It 's gone hard with her ever since we went 
into this business, and it is sure to get no better. 
I'm beginning to think, with our temperance friends, 
that it 's under a curse. You can make money, and 
money 's about everything in this world at least 
you and I thought so once. But peace of mind 
and a good conscience, if they are of any account, 
don 't  come, I'm thinking, in this way. If my pile 


was large enough, I 'd shut up shop or sell out 
to-morrow." 

" Yes, if the pile were large enough, Hiram," 
Lloyd answered, moodily, "but it isn t, you see. 
We can t afford to shut up shop: what would you 
and I be worth as bookbinders? Not much, I 
take it. My hand 's out, and I couldn 't make my 
salt." 

" I don 't  intend trying," I returned. " In for a 
penny, in for a pound. Going to get my pile, and 
so be able to snap my fingers in the world 's face. 
After that the gentleman !" 

The trouble for poor Maggy was not in the far 
distance. She was a liquor-seller 's daughter, and in 
a Sunday-school and among religious and charitable 
people out of place. The needy and suffering poor 
whose miseries she sought to alleviate were in most 
cases made poor and miserable through the very 
traffic that she was aware gave her a pleasant home, 
good food and fine clothing. 

One day she went to visit a poor woman who 
she learned was sick and unable to work. She took 
food to her hungry children, and did all in her power 
to comfort and help her. But the woman seemed 
hard and unthankful, and had a look in her face 
that hurt Maggy. 

Just as she was going away, this woman, whose 
drunken husband spent most of his earnings in 
dram-shops, took hold of Maggy 's dress, which was

of some fine material, and said, with a bitter sneer in 
her voice,
