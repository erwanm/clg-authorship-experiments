tion. They spoke to me in a language I had not 
heard for a long, long time. 

" We walked for several squares, the chairman of 
the Blessing talking all the while hopefully, and 
saying that I 'd find plenty of friends to stand by and 
help me if I kept true to my pledge, and I answering 
over and over again, 

" God helping me, I will ! Weak, broken, almost 
gone, I was now desperately in earnest. I said to 
myself, I will stand or die ! 

" My God-sent friend went with me to a house 
down in Seventh street, where I was taken in and 
kept for a few days. At first I was refused admis 
sion. But my friend would take no denial. He 
pleaded for me as if I had been a son or a brother. 
I heard him say, God has sent him to your door, 
a lost sheep of his fold just ready to perish; you 
dare not refuse to take him in. It may be the salva 
tion of a soul precious in his sight. 

" And so he prevailed. I had a warm bath, a clean 
shirt and a clean bed to lie down upon, a strong cup 
of coffee and something to eat. My filthy garments 
were all taken away, and my friend said, as he left 
me for the night, after having brought in a physician 
to give me something to take the place of liquor in 
my worn-out nervous system, and so keep me if 
possible from mania, In the morning I will bring 
you some better clothing. 

"What a night that was! I was afraid to lose 



 

myself in sleep, lest I should be seized by delirium. 
I got up and down, sometimes walking about the 
floor, sometimes kneeling and begging God to help 
and save me, sometimes so overcome with fear and 
despair as to cry like a child. None but the un 
happy ones who have had similar experiences can 
imagine anything of what I suffered. 

" Toward day I fell asleep, and when I woke, dear 
brother Heritage was sitting at my bedside. He 
took my hand and said, It is well. 

" God bless you ! I sobbed, and tears made me 
so blind that I could not see his face. He had 
brought me an old suit of clothes. They were lying 
across a chair. He pointed to them, saying, 

" We re going to have you all right, brother 
going to give you a good chance, going to help you 
up and make a man of you again. 

" I tried to rise, but sunk back weak and trem 
bling. All my strength was gone. I was like a 
man just over some crisis in a long sickness. But 
oh, words cannot tell the deep thankfulness that was 
in my heart. I was on the shore, far inside the 
bieakers, yet with their awful roar still sounding in 
my ears. 

"The woman to whose house I had been taken 
had now become interested in my case, and she 
cared for me as if I had been her own son. May 
God reward her ! as I know he will. 

" Entire rest, with nourishing food, gave a new 
life to the forces of nature, which were wellnigh ex- 



 

hausted. In a few days I was strong enough to go 
out, and now the peril came. 

" Dear brother, I said to the friend who had 
rescued me as I stood on the brink of destruction, 
what am I to do ? 

" Go to work, of course," he answered. It won t 
do to be idle. You 'd be down again before three 
days went over your head. 

" * Where am I to get work ? I asked. Nobody 
that knows me will have me about. 

" What can you do ? he asked, * and who do you 
know ? 

" I told him what my business had been and who 
had known me in my better days As I went over 
name after name he listened, and when I mentioned 
that of Mr. H , he said, 

" All right. I know H very well. He 'll 

give you a chance. 

"And so he did. I got into his store to do 
some odds and ends, for which he paid me five dol 
lars a week to begin with, and said if I did well he 
would increase my pay or help me to get another 
place. 

" But I wanted more than this for safety. Em 
ployment would only help me through the day, but 
what was I to do in the evening ? I should not dare 
to go on the street. In every square, and at almost 
every corner, hung red alluring lights. I could not 
turn my eyes in any direction without an invitation 
to drink, and appetite, only repressed, not destroyed, 

 



 

would arouse and plead for the draught so long 
denied. 

" My friend and brother knew all this, for he had 
himself walked the same dreary and perilous way, 
and walked it safely. He knew just what I needed 
and how the strength to keep on my feet must come. 
So he said to me on the morning of the day I went 
to work, 

" I will call for you this evening at your board 
ing-house. I want you at the " Blessing." 

" So I waited for him after supper. 

"As we walked toward Independence Hall he 
said, Now, brother Oldham, as God has saved you, 
you must gratefully consecrate yourself to the work 
of saving others. That was what I did. I was just 
as near destruction as you, and in my weakness and 
despair I looked to my Father in heaven, and he 
helped me, and as I felt a little strength of purpose 
coming in answer to my prayer, I promised that if I 
were saved I would give my very life to save others, 
if that must be. And so as soon as I had strength 
to get out I began to work among the intemperate, 
and my heart got so full of this work in a little while 
that I had stimulus enough, and so the old craving 
died. Now, what I want you to do to-night is to 
tell in the " Blessing " the story of your deliverance. 
It will come home to somebody, and help somebody. 
And I want you, if you see a poor worn-down 
drunkard drag himself up and sign the pledge just 
as you did, to look after him as I looked after you.
