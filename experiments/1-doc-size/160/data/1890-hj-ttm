she knew that she was moving, that she would always move, 
in its guiding light. This conviction was the one artless thing 
that glimmered like a young joy through the tragic mask of 
Constance, and Sherringham' s heart beat faster as he caught 
it in her face. It only made her appear more intelligent ; and 
yet there had been a time when he had thought her stupid ! 
Intelligent was the whole spirit in which she carried the scene, 
making him cry to himself from point to point : " How she 
feels it how she sees it how she creates it ! " 

He looked at moments at Madame Carre and perceived 
that she had an open book in her lap, apparently a French 
prose version, brought by her visitors, of the play ; but she 
never either glanced at him or at the volume ; she only sat 
screwing into the girl her hard bright eyes, polished by expe- 





rience like fine old brasses. The young man uttering the lines 
of the other speakers was attentive in another degree ; he 
followed Miriam in his own copy of the play, to be sure not 
to miss the cue ; but he was elated and expressive, was evi- 
dently even surprised ; he coloured and smiled, and when he 
extended his hand to assist Constance to rise, after Miriam, 
acting out her text, had seated herself grandly on " the huge, 
firm earth," he bowed over her as obsequiously as if she had 
been his veritable sovereign. He was a very good-looking 
young man, tall, well-proportioned, straight-featured and fair, 
of whom manifestly the first thing to be said on any occa- 
sion was that he looked remarkably like a gentleman. He 
carried this appearance, which proved inveterate and impor- 
tunate, to a point that was almost a negation of its spirit ; 
that is it might have been a question whether it could be in 
good taste to wear any character, even that particular one, so 
much on one's sleeve. It was literally on his sleeve that this 
young man partly wore his own ; for it resided considerably 
in his attire and especially in a certain close-fitting dark 
blue frock-coat (a miracle of a fit), which moulded his young 
form just enough and not too much and constituted (as 
Sherringham was destined to perceive later) his perpetual 
uniform or badge. It was not till later that Sherringham 
began to feel exasperated by Basil Dashwood's " type " (the 
young stranger was of course Basil Dash wood), and even by 
his blue frock-coat, the recurrent, unvarying, imperturbable 
" good form " of his aspect. This unprofessional air ended by 
striking the observer as the profession that he had adopted, 
and was indeed (so far as had as yet been indicated) his 
theatrical capital, his main qualification for the stage. 

The powerful, ample manner in which Miriam handled her 
scene produced its full impression, the art with which she 
surmounted its difficulties, the liberality with which she met 
its great demand upon the voice, and the variety of expression 
that she threw into a torrent of objurgation. It was a real 
composition, studded with passages that called a suppressed 
"Brava!" to the lips and seeming to show that a talent 
capable of such an exhibition was capable of anything. 

" But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy, 
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great : 
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast, 
And with the half-blown rose." 

As Miriam turned to her imagined child with this exquisite 
apostrophe (she addressed Mr. Dashwood as if he were playing 





Arthur, and he lowered his book, dropped his head and his 
eyes and looked handsome and ingenuous), she opened at a 
stroke to Sherringham's vision a prospect that they would 
yet see her express tenderness better even than anything else. 
Her voice was enchanting in these lines, and the beauty of 
her performance was that while she uttered the full fury of 
the part she missed none of its poetry. 

" Where did she get hold of that where did she get hold 
of that ?" Sherringham wondered while his whole sense 
vibrated. " She hadn't got hold of it when I went away." 
And the assurance flowed over him again that she had found 
the key to her box of treasures. In the summer, during their 
weeks of frequent meeting, she had only fumbled with the 
lock. One October day, while he was away, the key had 
slipped in, had fitted, or her finger at last had touched the 
right spring, and th capricious casket had flown open. 

It was during the present solemnity that Sherringham, 
excited by the way she came out and with a hundred startled 
ideas about her wheeling through his mind, was for the first 
time and most vividly visited by a perception that ended by 
becoming frequent with him that of the perfect presence of 
mind, unconfused, unhurried by emotion, that any artistic 
performance requires and that all, whatever the instrument, 
require in exactly the same degree : the application, in other 
words, clear and calculated, crystal-firm as it were, of the 
idea conceived in the glow of experience, of suffering, of joy. 
Sherringham afterwards often talked of this with Miriam, 
who however was not able to present him with a neat theory 
of the subject. She had no knowledge that it was publicly 
discussed ; she was just practically on the side of those who 
hold that at the moment of production the artist cannot have 
his wits too much about him. When Peter told her there 
were people who maintained that in such a crisis he must lose 
himself in the flurry she stared with surprise and then broke 
out : " Ah, the idiots ! " She eventually became in her judg- 
ments, in impatience and the expression of contempt, very 
free and absolutely irreverent. 

" What a splendid scolding ! " Sherringham exclaimed when, 
on the entrance of the Pope's legate, her companion closed the 
book upon the scene. Peter pressed his lips to Madame Carre's 
finger-tips ; the old actress got up and held out her arms to 
Miriam. The girl never took her eyes off Sherringham while 
she passed into Madame Carre's embrace and remained there. 
They were full of their usual sombre fire, and it was always 





the case that they expressed too much anything that they 
expressed at all ; but they were not defiant nor even triumph- 
ant now they were only deeply explicative ; they seemed to 
say : " That's the sort of thing I meant ; that's what I had 
in mind when I asked you to try to do something for me." 
Madame Carre folded her pupil to her bosom, holding her 
there as the old marquise in a comedie de mceurs might, in the 
last scene, have held her god-daughter the ingenue. 

" Have you got me an engagement ? " Miriam asked of 
Sherringham. " Yes, he has done something splendid for 
me," she went on to Madame Carre, resting her hand caress- 
ingly on one of the actress's while the old woman discoursed 
with Mr. Dashwood, who was telling her in very pretty 
French that he was tremendously excited about Miss Rooth. 
Madame Carre looked at him as if she wondered how he 
appeared when he was calm and how, as a dramatic artist, he 
expressed that condition. 

" Yes, yes, something splendid, for a beginning," Sherring- 
ham answered, radiantly, recklessly ; feeling now only that he 
would say anything, do anything, to please her. He spent 
on the spot, in imagination, his last penny. 

" It's such a pity you couldn't follow it ; you would have 
liked it so much better," Mr. Dashwood observed to his hostess. 

"Couldn't follow it ? Do you take me for une sotte ?" the 
celebrated artist cried. " I suspect I followed it de plus pres 
que vous, monsieur ! " 

" Ah, you see the language is so awfully fine," Basil Dash- 
wood replied, looking at his shoes. 

" The language ] Why, she rails like a fish-wife. Is that 
what you call language I Ours is another business."
