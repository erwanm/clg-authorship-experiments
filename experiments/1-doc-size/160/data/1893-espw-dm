the negro was respected, and the prize-fight 
er 's son personally respectable, Calhoun was 
not at home. The Vermont clergyman 's boy 
and the New York gentleman 's son knew 
how to adapt themselves to the social
problems of that world-in-little which a large New 
England college represents. But Calhoun 
had received a different education. 

The accident at the interrupted rush, in 
which Calhoun had been so unpleasantly 
prominent, gave the final touch to his 
unpopularity. A fellow who would spoil a 
rush, hit foul, and turn on a classmate, met 
with small favor at Harle College. From 
the date of that event Calhoun was doomed 
for the severest hazing of the year. 

Donald Marcy went into the affair hotly 
enough. The vigorous sense of chivalry in 



 

him, which Calhoun had so offended, was not 
balanced enough to keep him out of a secret 
personal attack, ten men to one. It did 
not occur to him that he might be doing as 
mean a deed as Calhoun 's ; clearly a meaner 
one from certain points of view, such as 
regulate the conditions of conflict between man 
and man in any other civilized set of 
circumstances outside of a college world. He 
plunged in, and thought about it as little as 
possible. 

Calhoun was in his room when the boys 
came upon him, a group of ten, disguised, 
masked, and determined. The door was 
locked. The hazors demanded admittance. 
Calhoun requested them, firmly enough, to 
visit a region geographically warmer than 
the entry of North Middle, top floor, upon 
that chilly night. 

" May as well let us in," insisted Donald 
Marcy. " We're bound to have you." 

" I 'll see you further, first ! " replied the 
Freshman. 

" It would save you some expense in locks," 
suggested one of the Sophomores. 

Calhoun made no answer. The pleasant 
puff of a plantation cheroot came out through 
the cracks of the door. The hazing party 



 

agreeably suggested that if he kept such a 
weed as that, he should invite them in for one 
apiece all round. Receiving no hospitality 
of this nature, they put their shoulder to the 
locked and bolted door, burst it in, and piled 
pell-mell into the Freshman 's room. 

Calhoun was standing there in the middle 
of the room, in his embroidered slippers and 
quilted dressing-gown, looking as pale and 
as plucky as was possible. He knew that he 
was unpopular in Harle College, and he 
knew that his hour had come. 

" Why didn't you let us in? " asked one 
of the fellows. " It would have been better 
for you." 

" I open my doors to gentlemen," replied 
the Southerner, " not to burglars." 

There was something in the justice and 
in the dignity of this reply not calculated to 
soothe the hazing party, who revenged them 
selves by proceeding to extreme measures 
with their victim without further parley. 
One of the boys produced a pair of hand 
cuffs, with which he intimated the intention 
of securing the Freshman, to start with ; for, 
as they all knew, he was a hot-blooded fellow. 
This particular Sophomore, his name, by 
the way, was Braggs ; Ben Braggs, when 



 

he had taken ten steps toward Calhoun, 
uttered an exclamation more warm than 
polite, and retreated more heartily than he had 
advanced. He was confronted by a fine 
Southern rifle, held straight to his face ; so 
close, that he could feel the cold lips of the 
weapon upon his forehead. 



CHAPTER IV. 

BURIED ALIVE. 

HARDLY had Calhoun presented the rifle 
when he observed that he would be some- 
thing-or-othered if they tried that again. 

" Oh, come," said Don Marcy. " What 's 
the use, Calhoun ? Why don't you put 
up with college fun as other fellows do ? 
There 's no sense in shooting. We're not 
blacklegs." 

" Oh, aren't you ? " asked Calhoun with 
his cold sneer. " It 's just as well you 
mentioned it. Pray, what are you, then ? " 

" Gentlemen and scholars," replied Don 
promptly. 

" Really ? " scoffed Calhoun. " Dear me ! 
I'm so glad you told me." 

" Look here ! " roared Trouncey O Grian 
in his big, bass voice, " we've fooled with 
you long enough, Calhoun. I'll put those 
handcuffs on, if you please, in the name of 
the Sophomore class of Harle College." 

Trouncey presented himself, breast to the 



 

rifle, with incredible coolness, and made a 
magnificent spring upon the Freshman, whose 
arms he pinioned with his own mighty ones 
sooner than the time it takes to tell it. As 
Calhoun sank into the scientific embrace of 
the prize-fighter 's son the trigger snapped, 
and the rifle dropped harmlessly to the floor 
as the handcuffs closed upon the Freshman 's 
writhing wrists. 

Trouncey O Grian smiled. He did not 
stop just then to explain to his host that he 
had climbed into that room at supper-time 
four stories up by the blinds and a peg or
