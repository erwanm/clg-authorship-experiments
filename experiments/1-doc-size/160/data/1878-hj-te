peated, smiling. 

Then she appeared to understand. " Another 
marriage ? " And she looked at the others. Fe- 
lix was chattering to Gertrude ; Charlotte, at a 
distance, was watching them ; and Mr. Brand, in 
quite another quarter, was turning his back to 
them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and 
his large head on one side, was looking at the 
small, tender crescent of a young moon. " It 
ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte," said Eu- 
genia, " but it does n't look like it." 

"There," Acton answered, "you must judge 
just now by contraries. There is more than there 
looks to be. I expect that combination one of 
these days ; but that is not what I meant." 

" Well," said the Baroness, " I never guess my 
own lovers ; so I can't guess other people's." 

Acton gave a loud laugh, and he was about to 



   

add a rejoinder when Mr. Wentworth approached 
his niece. " You will be interested to hear," the 
old man said, with a momentary aspiration to- 
ward jocosity, " of another matrimonial venture in 
our little circle." 

"I was just telling the Baroness," Acton ob- 
served. 

" Mr. Acton was apparently about to announce 
his own engagement," said Eugenia. 

Mr. Wentworth's jocosity increased. " It is 
not exactly that; but it is in the family. Clif- 
ford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had 
expressed a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his 
sister, took it into his head to arrange that, while 
his hand was in, our good friend should perform a 
like ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton." 

The Baroness threw back her head and smiled 
at her uncle; then turning, with an intenser ra- 
diance, to Robert Acton, " I am certainly very 
stupid not to have thought of that," she said. Ac- 
ton looked down at his boots, as if he thought 
he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate 
experimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said 
nothing more. It had been, in fact, a sharp knock, 
and she needed to recover herself. This was done, 
however, promptly enough. " Where are the young 
people ? " she asked. 

" They are spending the evening with my 
mother." 



 

" Is not the thing very sudden? " 

Acton looked up. " Extremely sudden. There 
had been a tacit understanding ; but within a day 
or two Clifford appears to have received some mys- 
terious impulse to precipitate the affair." 

" The impulse," said the Baroness, *' was the 
charms of your very pretty sister." 

" But my sister's charms were an old story ; he 
had always known her." Acton had begun to 
experiment again. 

Here, however, it was evident the Baroness 
would not help him. " Ah, one can't say ! Clif- 
ford is very young ; but he is a nice boy." 

" He's a likeable sort of boy, and he will be a 
rich man." This was Acton's last experiment. 
Madame Miinster turned away. 

She made but a short visit and Felix took her 
home. In her little drawing-room she went almost 
straight to the mirror over the chimney-piece, and, 
with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. "I 
shall not wait for your marriage," she said to her 
brother. " To morrow my maid shall pack up." 

" My dear sister," Felix exclaimed, " we are to 
be married immediately ! Mr. Brand is too un- 
comfortable." 

But Eugenia, turning and still holding her 
candle aloft, only looked about the little sitting- 
room at her gimcracks and curtains and cushions. 



   

"My maid shall pack up," she repeated. " Bont
divine, what rubbish I I feel like a strolling act- 
ress ; these are my 4 properties.' " 

" Is the play over, Eugenia ? " asked Felix. 

She gave him a sharp glance. " I have spoken 
my part." 

" With great applause ! " said her brother. 

"Oh, applause applause!" she murmured. 
And she gathered up two or three of her dispersed 
draperies. She glanced at the beautiful brocade, 
and then, " I don't see how I can have endured 
it I " she said. 

" Endure it a little longer. Come to my wed- 
ding." 

" Thank you ; that 's your affair. My affairs 
are elsewhere." 

" Where are you going ? " 

" To Germany by the first ship." 

" You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton ? " 

" I have refused him," said Eugenia. 

Her brother looked at her in silence. " I am 
sorry," he rejoined at last. " But I was very dis- 
creet, as you asked me to be. I said nothing." 

" Please continue, then, not to allude to the 
matter," said Eugenia. 

Felix inclined himself gravely. " You shall be 
obeyed. But your position in Germany?" he 
pursued. 



 

" Please to make no observations upon it." 

" I was only going to say that I supposed it 
was altered." 

" You are mistaken."
