to time they stopped, in the earnestness of their 
parley, and stood talking, and then loitered on again 
in the summer security from oversight which they 
were too rapt to recognise. They reached the top of 
the hill, and came to a door where she stopped. He 
fell back a pace. " Good-bye It was eternal 

loss, but it was escape. 

She smiled in timorous hesitation. " Won't you 
come in \ And I will get Mr. Berry 's letter." 

She opened the door with a latch-key, and he 
followed her within ; a servant-girl came half-way 
up the basement stairs to see who it was, and then 
wenfr down. She left him in the dim parlour a 
moment, while she went to get the letter. When 
she returned, "I have a little room for my work at 
the top of the house," she said, " but it will never be 
like the St. Albans. There 's no one else here yet, 
and it 's pretty lonesome without Madeline." 

x She sank into a chair, but he remained standing, 
and seemed not to heed her when she asked him to 
sit down. He put Berry 's letter into his pocket 
without looking at it, and she rose again. 

She must have thought he was going, and she 
said with a smile of gentle trust, "It 's been like 
having last winter back again to see you. We 
thought you must have gone home right after the 
fire ; we didn't see anything of you again. We went 
ourselves in about a week." 

Then she did not know, and he must tell her 
himself. 



 

" Did Mr. Berry say anything about me at the 
fire that last day ? " he began bluntly. 

" No ! " she said, looking at him with surprise ; 
there was a new sound in his voice. " He had no 
need to say anything ! I wanted to tell you to 
write and tell you how much I honoured you for 
it how ashamed I was for misunderstanding you 
just before, when " 

He knew that she meant when they all pitied him 
for a coward. 

Her voice trembled ; he could tell that the tears 
were in her eyes. He tried to put the sweetness of 
her praise from him. "Oh, it wasn't that that I 
meant," he groaned; and he wrenched the words 
out. " That fellow, who said he was a friend of mine, 
and got into the house that way, was a thief ; and 
Mr. Berry caught him robbing his room the day of 
the fire, and treated me as if I knew it and was 
helping him on 

" Oh ! " cried the girl. " How cruel ! How could 
lie do that ? " 

Lemuel could not suffer himself to take refuge in 
her generous faith now. 

" When I first came to Boston, I had my money 
stolen, and there were two days when I had nothing 
to eat ; and then I was arrested by mistake for 
stealing a girl 's satchel ; and when I was acquitted, 
I slept the next night in the tramp 's lodging-house, 
and that fellow was there, arid when he came to the 
St. Albans I was ashamed to tell where I had known 
him, and so I let him pass himself off for my friend." 



 

He kept his eyes fixed on hers, bat he could not 
see them change from their pity of him, or light up 
with a sense of any squalor in his history. 

"And I used to think that my life had been 
hard ! " she cried. " Oh, how much you have been 
through ! " 

" And after that," he pursued, " Mr. Sewell got me 
a place, a sort of servant 's place, and when I lost that 
I came to be the man-of-all work at the St. Albans." 

In her eyes the pity was changing to admiration ; 
his confession which he had meant to be so abject 
had kindled her fancy like a boastful tale. 

"How little we know about people and what 
they have suffered ! But I thank you for telling me 
this oh yes ! and I shall always think of myself 
with contempt. How easy and pleasant my life 
has been ! And you 

She stopped, and he stood helpless against her 
misconception. He told her about the poverty he 
had left at home, and the wretched circumstance of 
his life, but she could not see it as anything but 
honourable to his present endeavour. She listened 
with breathless interest to it all, and, " Well," she 
sighed at last, " it will always be something for you 
to look back to, and be proud of. And that girl 
did she never say or do anything to show that she 
was sorry for that cruel mistake ? Did you ever see 
her afterwards ? " 

"Yes," said Lemuel, sick at heart, and feeling how 
much more triumphantly he could have borne 
ignominy and rejection than this sweet sympathy. 

 

She seemed to think he would say something more, 
but he turned away from her, and after a little 
silence of expectance she let him go, with promises 
to come again, which she seemed to win from him 
for his own sake. 

In the street he took out Berry 's letter and read 
it. 

" DEAR OLD MAN, I've been trying to get off a letter to 
you almost any time the last three months ; but I've  been 
round so much, and upside down so much since I saw you 
out to W. T. and on my head in Western Mass. that I've  
not been able to fetch it. I don't know as I could fetch it 
now, if it wasn't for the prospective Mrs. A. W. B., Jr., 
standing over me with a revolver, and waiting to see me do 
it. I've  just been telling her about that little interview of 
ours with Williams, that day, and she thinks I ought to be 
man enough to write and say that I guess I was all wrong 
about you ; I had a sneaking idea of the kind from the start 
almost, but if a fellow 's proud at all, he 's proiul of his mis 
takes, and he hates to give them up. I' m pretty badly balled 
lip now, and I can't seem to get the right words aboub 
remorse, and so forth ; but you know how it is yourself. I 
am sorry, there 's no two ways about that ; but I've  kept 
my suspicions as well as my regrets to myself, and now I do 
the best thing I can by way of reparation. I send this letter 
by Miss Carver. She hasn't read it, and she don't know 
what it 's all about ; but I guess you'd better tell her. 
Don't spare, yours truly, A. W. BERRY, JR."
