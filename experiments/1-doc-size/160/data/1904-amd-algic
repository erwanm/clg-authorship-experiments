thing. Dan wanted to be married quietly at home. 
But I coaxed Mother Hayne over to my views, and we 
settled upon the old Methodist Church. 

"I shall be married there or not at all !" I said to Dan 
decidedly. 

So we were married in the new Methodist Church on 
Washington Street, at noon, and I had three brides 
maids. My gown was white Suisse with plenty of 



 

lace, and Dan gave a dinner at the hotel. It was very 
merry and pleasant. Healths were proffered, good 
wishes and kisses, for everybody kissed a bride then. 
I think Dan glowered a little over this. He had to take 
a good deal of chaffing and I was advised to "keep him 
with a pretty tight rein and make him toe the mark." 
There was the old joke of starting him out in the 
morning to kindle the fire, and having him split the 
kindlings and bring the water. 

The infare was to be at our new house, and invita 
tions were scattered freely. 

I wondered if there were any heart burnings among 
the girls. I did not feel at all elated that I had cap 
tured him. Rather he had captured me. I could say 
honestly I had never made an effort. 

Then we returned home to our little old house and 
had to take a horrible serenade. Dan went out and 
made a speech, gave the ringleader of the party some 
money and quiet was restored. 

A fortnight after that we moved. Dan's mother 
gave him a feather bed and pillows, two heavy blank 
ets and two light ones and six teaspoons that had been 
her mother's. She thought the oldest son ought to have 
them, and a tablecloth that had been in her wedding 
outfit. 

The new house was very nice and comfortable, but 
a modern bride would have rather disdained it. The 
infare was a success. After that we were let to go our 
way, for there were several other brides, Miss Camp 
bell being one, and she had married a promising young 
lawyer. 





Father improved a good deal that summer. Jolette 
had gone with us and there was a half -grown boy who 
did chores, worked in the garden and went home 
nights. 

Before father had finished his stores he was offered 
such an advantageous price for them that he sold and 
reinvested in land farther out. Dan hardly considered 
that wise. 

"Everybody thought I was bit with the old Towner 
place," and father laughed. "The city is going to 
stretch out, and the lake shore is going to be valuable." 
"Was I happy and in love?" Truly I could not tell. 
I counted on the time when Dan's vehemence should be 
toned down. He bought a pretty new horse, broken 
for a lady's riding, and we used to have splendid gal 
lops. 

Norman Hayne was travelling in Prussia and Russia. 
Ben entered Harvard. I think he did not altogether 
approve my marriage, but I gave him good reasons for 
it. Homer had a little son. Everybody seemed pros 
perous, though there were troublous times about money. 
The world was set ablaze then about the wonderful 
discovery of gold in California, the dream of the old 
Spanish explorers. Men rushed to the gold fields in 
perfect armies. And now we felt as a nation there 
was a great deal of grandeur in owning from ocean to 
ocean. Marvels were told of the western coast. 

I settled down into a housewifely body. Father said 
now and then, "Oh, that is so like your mother." 

He could not discard his crutches. He still kept up 
his interest in the Prairie Farmer, and had begun to 



 

write other articles. The water works were occupying 
a good deal of attention. The lead mines were inex 
haustible. Yet it took almost a week to get to New 
York. The Illinois and Michigan canal was opened. 
There were some brick buildings, and two aristocratic 
blue limestone ones that were pointed out as curiosities, 
having been built of stone that had been brought in 
ballast from the lower lakes. Michigan Avenue that 
was. 

The Chicago River was being widened. Sidewalks 
were laid as the streets were filled up. Old Chicago 
was passing away, just as the Little Girl had vanished, 
though father often used the name. Dan had given me 
all sorts of pet names at first, then he settled down to 
Ruth. 

And so a year passed, two years. Dan was much 
interested in city affairs, father was making money in 
the old ways. We had settled down, and I supposed I 
had all the happiness that comes to married life. No, 
not all. There was no child to gladden our hearts and 
draw us together. Homer had another little boy. 

In the third year of our married life an incident hap 
pened that, perhaps, was an entering wedge in the dis 
satisfaction that came afterwards. One day father re 
ceived a letter from a cousin who had married another 
cousin by the name of Gaynor. She had been left a 
widow some years before. The homestead had been 
willed to the eldest son, subject to her life-right in four 
rooms one side of the hall, and her living from the farm. 
The three daughters between had married, there was 
one son, now sixteen, who did not get on at all well 





with his elder brother. He was a smart, bright boy, 
with a fair education. Now, he was wild to go to 
California, but she could not bear to think of the rough 
life and the temptations, so she was emboldened to write 
to her cousin, who she heard had done well in Chicago. 
"Could he put John in the way of anything?" 

There was an appeal to old memories that touched 
me. Father so seldom mentioned his people. 

"That's queer, isn't it?" he said, looking up with a 
dry sort of smile. "John Gaynor! Why, I had for 
gotten that I had a namesake." 

"You might send for him," I suggested. "Sixteen. 
And if he is a nice boy why do you give that absent 
sort of smile?" 

"I was thinking. When I was a young fellow of 
nineteen or so I fell headlong in love with a second 
cousin, Sarah Parks. She was twenty-three. She rea 
soned me mostly out of it, and I found she had a fancy 
for an own cousin, Luther Gaynor. So she married him. 
Then I went to the western part of the State, and when
