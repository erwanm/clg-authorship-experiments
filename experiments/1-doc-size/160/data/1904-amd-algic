we growing nearer each other, reading the same books, 
enjoying thrilling or tender verses, walks and talks, 
and then I knew there would not have been any re 
pulsion, that I should have been glad, glad with su 
preme joy, just as Sophie had been. 

I laid the package down on the table. Father was in 
his office, but I could not go in. I went up to our 
room, took off my bonnet and glanced around. Dan 
had been in and changed his clothes. Trousers thrown 
over a chair, collar and stock on the bureau, shoes 
and a soiled handkerchief on the floor. Dan had gone 
off somewhere. The most curious repulsion came over 
me. I could not touch one article to put them away. 
Oh, if I could run away somewhere but there was 
father. Keeping together "as long as ye both do 
live." 

"Ruth!" called father. 

It might have been minutes or hours, it seemed an 
endless while to me. 

"Did you get the paper? Come down. I want to 
make out some bills. Dan's gone to Batavia for two 
days, left his good-by. Why, Ruth, you look like a 
ghost, what is the matter?" 





"Do I?" I tried to laugh, but my mouth was stiff, 
and I felt numb all over. "I don't think it anything. 
I may have walked too fast. The sun is hot." 

He put me in the big rocking chair. I picked up 
a fan. I was cold enough, Heaven knew, but I wanted 
to make some movement. 

"Ruth, I think you are not well. You grow thinner 
all the time, and you have no flesh to lose. We must 
have the doctor. Child, I have been comforting my 
self that matters were better with you " 

His kindly eyes were full of solicitude. 

I made a great effort. "If you mean with Dan," 
I said, "they are. He is much pleasanter. I think he 
has gotten over the trouble about the house, though 
sometimes I have wondered whether he might not have 
it when I am gone." 

"No," father replied, almost with set teeth. "You 
need not go for that. I'm not sure but it would be 
better for you to deed it back to me. Still if things 
go on, well " 

He hobbled to the closet and brought me some wine. 
That refreshed me. Then he opened the package, 
made out some bills, straightened his accounts when 
it was supper-time. 

John came over in the evening, and father would 
keep him all night. I felt quite as well as usual. 
When I went upstairs I laid the soiled things away, 
hung up his trousers, but his vest fell to the floor, and 
his knife and pencil rolled out with a bit of paper. I 
put the two back, crumpled up the paper, then be 
thought myself it might be a memorandum of some- 



 

thing and spread it out, took it over to the candle. It 
was a pencil scrawl. 

"You will find me at Weesaukie's lodge at twi 
light." It was not Dan's writing. 

There was no name. He had taken Duke and gone 
in the buggy. Was he to have a companion? It 
turned me sick and cold again. Polly's glittering, 
mocking eyes and her insolent tones with their half 
veiled gayety swept over me. Was it would it be 
Polly? Oh, no, no, Dan could not do such a thing as 
that! 

For all Polly's brave show of mourning it was 
whispered that her married life had not been altogether 
serene, and that she made little ado about the loss of 
her grandeur. 

All night something haunted me, a kind of imper 
sonal agency, treacherous, trying to lure me some 
where in darkness and vagueness, while I had to make 
a great effort to hold back. And then I was wandering 
over wild, dreary prairie land, at last coming out to 
a strange black, silent lake. What splashed into it? 
The cry woke me, and my heart beat with a great 
terror. 

"John," I said to the young cousin, "I want you to 
go down to the Morrison house this noon and take a 
note, but do not give it to any one except Polly. If 
she isn't home, and she may not be, you say it is all 
right, and be sure to bring the note back to me. Don't 
leave your name or anything. Come back to 
night." 

It was a daring thing if Polly was home. 





I busied myself about household duties, and in the 
afternoon a neighbor came in with her two little ones. 
What made every one so anxious to know how much 
fortune Norman would have? Still I was glad of the 
break, for father had gone out to look after the men. 
The weather was fine and he was anxious to get in 
some of the crops. Then he took a rest in his easy 
chair. 

I walked down the street a short distance. John 
came hurrying along whistling, but stopped, thrust his 
hand in his pocket. 

"She wasn't home, Cousin Ruth. The woman 
wanted the note, but I wouldn't give it to her. She 
told me to come on Friday." 

"Yes," I returned breathlessly. "Do not mention 
it to father," and I took the missive. 

Then Polly was away as well ! 

Dan came home late Friday night, good natured, 
bustling, and announced that he must start early the 
next morning for Galena on some important business. 
He hoped I had not missed him much. He was sorry 
to go away at this busy season, but he would make it 
all right with father. Indeed, he began to think with 
so much business of his own they would really need a 
regular overseer. 

"Now if that Gaynor boy was four or five years 
older, he might come." 

I was thunderstruck. "I thought you did not like 
him," I half faltered. 

"I don't, but your father seems to like him." 

The tone was rather sarcastic. I made no reply. I
