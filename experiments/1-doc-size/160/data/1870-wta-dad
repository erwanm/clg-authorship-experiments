a very anxious expression.

"We are certainly following the Florina, though we are at least three
miles from her. I don't think we shall overhaul her till she comes
about, or makes a harbor."

There was another pause: and when I saw how anxious Miss Collingsby
was, I could not help feeling a strong sympathy with her. The scream
had not yet been explained to me; but I concluded that the gallant
skipper had alarmed her by being too demonstrative in his attentions.

"Do you know where we are going?" she inquired.

"I do not; only that we are to join Mr. Whippleton."

"I wish I was on shore again," said she, with a sigh.

"Why?" I asked, in the simplicity of my heart; for I thought, if she
was fond of sailing, that she ought to enjoy the trip, for certainly
nothing could be pleasanter.

"I have been very imprudent. I ought not to have come," she replied, in
a low tone.

"Did you scream?" I ventured to inquire, in a whisper.

"I did."

"What was the matter?"

"I have been very imprudent," she repeated, her face glowing with
confusion.

"I hope he didn't harm you."

"O, no! He didn't mean to harm me; but he was impudent and insulting. I
will never speak to him again, as long as I live!"

"Of course your father knew you were coming with Mr. Waterford."

"No; he did not; but my mother did. My father is very stern, and very
particular, I suppose you know. He hates Mr. Waterford, while my mother
thinks he is a very fine man. But my mother told me not to come with
him unless there were other ladies in the party."

"He seems to have a very high regard for you," said I. "He has named
his boat after you."

"But I have been very imprudent, Phil. I am afraid of Mr. Waterford."

"You need not be afraid of him. I will see that no harm comes to you,
and that you return home safely."

"You are my father's clerk--are you not?"

"I am."

"I saw you at the house this morning; and I have heard that you were a
very good young man. You will not let him harm me."

"Certainly not."

She was really terrified, though I could not see any good reason for
her fears.

"You must be very watchful, too," she added.

"Why, what do you fear?"

"He means to get rid of you," she answered, her face crimson with
blushes.

"To get rid of me!" I exclaimed.

"He said so to me. You will not expose my weakness, if I tell you all,
Philip?" said she, the tears starting in her beautiful eyes; and really
I felt like crying myself.

"Not a word, nor a hint," I protested.

"Mr. Waterford has been very attentive to me for a year; and I confess
that I liked him. But my father said he was an unprincipled man."

"Your father was right."

"I fear he was. Mr. Waterford asked me, several weeks ago, to run away
with him, and be married in some town on the other side of the lake. I
was weak enough to listen to him, but not to accept his proposition. He
repeated it to-day, and with some familiarity which frightened me, and
made me scream. I never was so alarmed before in my life."

"What did he do?"

"He put his arm around me, and attempted to kiss me," said she,
desperately. "Now you know the worst."

I did not think it was so bad as it might be, after she had encouraged
him by listening to his proposals.

"He is a bad man. I begin to be of my father's opinion in regard to
him."

"Mr. Whippleton is another bad man," I added.

"Mr. Whippleton! What, my father's partner?"

At the risk of letting the beef be burned, I told her briefly the
history of the man, and that he was even then running from the officer,
while I was in pursuit of him.

"Dear me! What will become of me!" she exclaimed.

"Don't be afraid of anything. I will protect you."

"But you don't know the worst!"

"Do you?"

"I think I do. He has decoyed me into this boat, and he means to get
rid of you. He told me so. Then he will take me to some town on the
lake, if he can persuade me to accept his proposal. Don't leave me,
Phil! Don't let him get rid of you!"

"I will not."

"I think I understand him perfectly, now; and I feel very miserable to
think I disregarded the instructions of my mother. He will persecute me
till I consent to his proposal," continued the poor girl, wiping away
her tears. "I shall depend upon you for my safety, Philip."

"I will not fail you, Miss Collingsby. I do not mean to lose sight of
Mr. Whippleton, and I have no idea of being thrust out of the way," I
replied, as I dished up the beefsteak, and put the plate on the table.

"Dinner is ready," I shouted, when I had placed the potatoes and coffee
on the table.

My mission below for the present was accomplished, and I went on deck
by the fore scuttle. I looked for the Florina as soon as I went up, and
found that she had hauled her wind, and was standing towards the
Illinois shore of the lake. The Marian had followed her example. I saw
the former enter a creek soon after, where she disappeared from our
view. I knew the locality very well, for I had been up the creek in the
Florina with Mr. Whippleton. The mouth of it was a broad lagoon, which
extends into a series of swamps.

"Take the helm, Phil," said Mr. Waterford, as I walked aft to the
standing-room. "Is dinner on the table?"

"Yes, all ready."

"Head her into the creek, Phil, and we will land there," added he, as
he went below, leaving me in charge of the yacht.

I could not help thinking that Miss Collingsby was more frightened than
hurt. She was certainly a beautiful girl, and was sure to have a
princely dowry when she was married. I could not blame Mr. Waterford
for wanting her, and I was confident Mr. Collingsby would never consent
to such a match. Without appearing to be suspicious, I intended to
watch the skipper closely, and if he attempted to get rid of me, he
