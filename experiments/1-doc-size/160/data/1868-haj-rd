"Keep up a little longer," they shouted, bending to their oars,
"and we will save you."

Dick heard the shout, and it put fresh strength into him. He battled
manfully with the treacherous sea, his eyes fixed longingly upon the
approaching boat.

"Hold on tight, little boy," he said. "There's a boat coming."

The little boy did not see the boat. His eyes were closed to shut
out the fearful water, but he clung the closer to his young
preserver. Six long, steady strokes, and the boat dashed along side.
Strong hands seized Dick and his youthful burden, and drew them into
the boat, both dripping with water.

"God be thanked!" exclaimed the father, as from the steamer he saw
the child's rescue. "That brave boy shall be rewarded, if I
sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it."

"You've had a pretty narrow escape, young chap," said one of the
boatmen to Dick. "It was a pretty tough job you undertook."

"Yes," said Dick. "That's what I thought when I was in the water. If
it hadn't been for you, I don't know what would have 'come of us."

"Anyhow you're a plucky boy, or you wouldn't have dared to jump into
the water after this little chap. It was a risky thing to do."

"I'm used to the water," said Dick, modestly. "I didn't stop to
think of the danger, but I wasn't going to see that little fellow
drown without tryin' to save him."

The boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the Brooklyn side.
The captain of the ferry-boat, seeing the rescue, did not think
it necessary to stop his boat, but kept on his way. The whole
occurrence took place in less time than I have occupied in
telling it.

The father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy, with
what feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood. With a
burst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms. Dick was about to
withdraw modestly, but the gentleman perceived the movement, and,
putting down the child, came forward, and, clasping his hand, said
with emotion, "My brave boy, I owe you a debt I can never repay.
But for your timely service I should now be plunged into an anguish
which I cannot think of without a shudder."

Our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions, but always
felt awkward when he was praised.

"It wasn't any trouble," he said, modestly. "I can swim like a top."

"But not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger,"
said the gentleman. "But," he added with a sudden thought, as his
glance rested on Dick's dripping garments, "both you and my little
boy will take cold in wet clothes. Fortunately I have a friend
living close at hand, at whose house you will have an opportunity
of taking off your clothes, and having them dried."

Dick protested that he never took cold; but Fosdick, who had now
joined them, and who, it is needless to say, had been greatly
alarmed at Dick's danger, joined in urging compliance with the
gentleman's proposal, and in the end our hero had to yield. His
new friend secured a hack, the driver of which agreed for extra
recompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage, and they
were whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street, where
matters were quickly explained, and both boys were put to bed.

"I aint used to goin' to bed quite so early," thought Dick. "This is
the queerest excursion I ever took."

Like most active boys Dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending
half a day in bed; but his confinement did not last as long as he
anticipated.

In about an hour the door of his chamber was opened, and a servant
appeared, bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout.

"You are to put on these," said the servant to Dick; "but you
needn't get up till you feel like it."

"Whose clothes are they?" asked Dick.

"They are yours."

"Mine! Where did they come from?"

"Mr. Rockwell sent out and bought them for you. They are the
same size as your wet ones."

"Is he here now?"

"No. He bought another suit for the little boy, and has gone back to
New York. Here's a note he asked me to give you."

Dick opened the paper, and read as follows,--


"Please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of
a debt which I can never repay. I have asked to have your wet suit
dried, when you can reclaim it. Will you oblige me by calling
to-morrow at my counting room, No. --, Pearl Street.

  "Your friend,
  "JAMES ROCKWELL."



CHAPTER XXVII

CONCLUSION


When Dick was dressed in his new suit, he surveyed his figure with
pardonable complacency. It was the best he had ever worn, and fitted
him as well as if it had been made expressly for him.

"He's done the handsome thing," said Dick to himself; "but there
wasn't no 'casion for his givin' me these clothes. My lucky stars
are shinin' pretty bright now. Jumpin' into the water pays better
than shinin' boots; but I don't think I'd like to try it more'n once
a week."

About eleven o'clock the next morning Dick repaired to Mr.
Rockwell's counting-room on Pearl Street. He found himself in front
of a large and handsome warehouse. The counting-room was on the
lower floor. Our hero entered, and found Mr. Rockwell sitting at a
desk. No sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose, and,
advancing, shook Dick by the hand in the most friendly manner.

"My young friend," he said, "you have done me so great service that
I wish to be of some service to you in return. Tell me about
yourself, and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future."

Dick frankly related his past history, and told Mr. Rockwell of his
desire to get into a store or counting-room, and of the failure of
all his applications thus far. The merchant listened attentively to
Dick's statement, and, when he had finished, placed a sheet of paper
before him, and, handing him a pen, said, "Will you write your name
on this piece of paper?"

Dick wrote in a free, bold hand, the name Richard Hunter. He had
very much improved in his penmanship, as has already been mentioned,
and now had no cause to be ashamed of it.

Mr. Rockwell surveyed it approvingly.

"How would you like to enter my counting-room as clerk, Richard?" he
asked.

Dick was about to say "Bully," when he recollected himself, and
answered, "Very much."

"I suppose you know something of arithmetic, do you not?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a
week. You may come next Monday morning."
