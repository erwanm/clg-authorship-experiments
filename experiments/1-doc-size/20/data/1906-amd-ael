boys usually returned from school. 
“Do you believe they will come to-day. 
Aunt Sarah?” he asked, after he had fidgeted 
about awhile, and she had tried very hard not 
to be nervous. 
“Not so soon, perhaps,” in the most soothing 
tone. 
“O dear! I ’d rather be back at school. 
How dull it is without anybody.” 
“I wish I could make it brighter for you, 
Frank,” and Aunt Sarah’s eyes filled with 
tears. 
“Oh ! you are good enough.” 
Then the boy’s restless eyes wandered down 
the street. If there only was some one to 
play with, to talk to, or even to share a walk. 
After the crowd of boys at school, it was very 
lonesome indeed. And somehow the Crosbys 
seemed so much nicer than Dan Price.
