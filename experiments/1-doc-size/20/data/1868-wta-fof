"You run no risk," added Dock, as he wrote with a pencil, on half a
sheet of note paper, the letter which Captain Gauley received just
before the Caribbee sailed. "Put this in an envelope, direct it to
Captain John Gauley, care of E. G. Baines & Co., No. ---- Maiden Lane,
New York, and put it into the post office. That's all; and here is a
hundred dollars."

Constable Cooke took the note and the money. Dock wrote the direction
for the letter on a piece of paper. He thrust the whole into his
pocket. He had his doubts, as well he might, about the propriety of
mailing the letter.

Levi, from the information obtained, was satisfied that the Caribbee
was at anchor in one of the secluded inlets below New York, waiting for
Dock to join her. It was not likely that she would go to sea without
her owner, whose family were on board of her.

"Dock says she will go to Australia, whether he joins her or not," said
Mr. Gayles.
