Namur, are crumbling; Louvain has been swept by shells.  The great
cupola forts are in ruins; everything is on fire; they are shooting the
people in their houses, in the streets—the dead lie everywhere—women,
children, in the ditches, in the fields, on the highroads.  Ah, Monsieur
Warner, c’est triste, allez!"

"Where did you hear such things, François?"
