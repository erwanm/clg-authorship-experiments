"What!"
"Certainly, I brought my effects!  I have some money—not very much.  I
shall go to the inn and remain there until you have decided what it is
best for me to do."
The situation began to strike him as sufficiently ludicrous—the tragic
mask is always on the verge of a grin—but he did not feel like smiling.
For a few minutes he occupied himself with collecting, strapping, and
slinging his kit; and when he was ready to go, he looked down at the
girl Philippa, where she was seated watching him out of her trustful
grey eyes.
"I can employ you as a model," he said, "until Monsieur Wildresse sends
for you.  What do you think of the idea?"
"As a—a model, Monsieur?" she stammered.
"Yes.  You could pose for me, if you like."
A delicate scarlet flush slowly mounted to her hair.
Perplexed, he watched her.
"Don’t you like the idea?"  And suddenly he divined what was troubling
her.  "Not that sort of model," he said, amused.  "You shall wear your
clothes, Philippa."
"Oh....  Yes, I should like it, I think."
