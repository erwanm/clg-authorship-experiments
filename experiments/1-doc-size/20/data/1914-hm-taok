Matters came to pass as Ramabai had planned: the night work in the
arena, the clearing of the tunnel, the making of the trap, the
perfecting of all the details of escape.  Ahmed would be given charge
of the exit, Lal Singh of the road, and Ali (Bruce's man) would arrange
that outside the city there should be no barriers.  All because Ramabai
thought more of his conscience than of his ambitions for Pundita.
And when, late in the afternoon, the exhibition was over, Kathlyn
stepped upon the trap, threw aside her veil and revealed herself to the
spectators.  For all her darkened skin they recognized her, and a deep
murmur ran round the arena.  Kathlyn, knowing how volatile the people
were, extended her hands toward the royal box.  When the murmurs died
away she spoke in Hindustani:
"I will face the arena lions!"
The murmurs rose again, gaining such volume that they became roars,
which the disturbed beasts took up and augmented.
Again Kathlyn made a sign for silence, and added: "Provided my sister
stands at my side!"
To this Umballa said no.  The multitude shouted defiance.  In the arena
they were masters, even as the populace in the old days of Rome were
masters of their emperors.
