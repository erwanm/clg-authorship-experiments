"Bring the net!" shouted Ahmed.  To the trembling bearer he said: "Lead
us; we follow.  And if you have spoken the truth you shall not only
have your freedom, but rupees for your old age."

A lion's net is a heavy affair, but with the aid of the keepers the men
ran as quickly and lightly as if burdenless.  Smoke.  There was a fire.
The hearts of the white men beat painfully.  And the same thought
occurred to both of them; they should have gone to Ramabai's house
first, then turned their attention to the lions.  And Umballa was
hiding in a house near by!

Well for them that they entered the doomed quarter as they did.
Kathlyn saw them, and the muzzle of the revolver which she was pressing
to her heart lowered, the weapon itself slipping from her hand to the
roof.  God was not going to let her die like this.

"Spread out the net!" commanded Bruce.  "Kathlyn, can you hear me?" he
shouted, cupping his hands before his mouth.  Faintly he heard her
reply.  "When I give the word, jump.  Do not be afraid."
