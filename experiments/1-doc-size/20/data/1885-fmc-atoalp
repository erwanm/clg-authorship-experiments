corner where they were repairing the street. The horse went down with a
smash, shafts, lamp, everything broken to smithereens, as they say. The
policeman jumps off the box with the cabby to see what is the matter. One
of the bobbies--the policemen I would say--it's a technical term, Mr.
Juxon--gets out of the cab to see what's up, leaving Goddard in charge of
the other. Then there is a terrific row; more carts come up, more
fourwheelers--everybody swearing at once. Presently the policeman who
had got out comes back and looks in to see if everything is straight. Not
a bit of it again. Other door of the cab was open and--no Goddard. But
the policeman was lying back in the corner and when they struck a light
and looked, they found he was stone dead. Goddard had brained him with
the irons on his wrists. No one ever saw him from that day to this. He
must have known London well--they say he did, and he was a noted quick
runner. Being nightfall and rather foggy as it generally is in those
parts he got clear off. But he killed the man who had him in charge and
if he lives he will have to swing for it. May be Mrs. Goddard does not
know that---may be she does. That is the reason I don't want her to be
left alone with him. No doubt she is very good and all that, but she
might just take it into her head to save the government twenty feet of
rope."
