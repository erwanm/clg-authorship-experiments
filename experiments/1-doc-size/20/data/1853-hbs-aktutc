  outward show of insolence. His contempt for the humane feelings of
  the audience and community about him was too true to require any
  assumption of that kind. He neither paraded nor attempted to conceal
  the worst features of his calling. He treated it as a matter of
  business which he knew the community shuddered at, but the moral
  nature of which he was utterly indifferent to, beyond a certain
  secret pleasure in thus indirectly inflicting a little torture on
  his hearers.
  I am not, however, altogether clear, to do John Caphart justice,
  that he is entirely conscience-proof. There was something in his
  anxious look which leaves one not without hope.
  At the first trial we did not know of his pursuits, and he passed
  merely as a police-man of Norfolk, Virginia. But, at the second
  trial, some one in the room gave me a hint of the occupations many
  of these police-men take to, which led to my cross-examination.

      at Boston, in June and Nov., 1851, and October, 1852.
  Question. Is it a part of your duty, as a police-man, to take up
  colored persons who are out after hours in the streets?
  Answer. Yes, sir.
