Boil and chop very fine, or rub through a cullender. Season with
pepper and salt. Beat in, while warm, three tablespoonfuls melted
butter (this is for a large dish). Put into a saucepan and heat,
stirring constantly. When smoking hot, add three tablespoonfuls of
cream and a teaspoonful white sugar. Boil up once, still stirring, and
press firmly into a hot bowl or other mould. Turn into a hot dish and
garnish with boiled eggs.


GREEN PEAS.

Shell and lay in cold water until you are ready to cook them. Put into
salted boiling water, and cook from twenty minutes to half an hour.
If young and fresh, the shorter time will suffice. If just gathered
from your own vines and tender, season only with salt. Market peas are
greatly improved by the addition of a small lump of white sugar. It
improves taste and color. The English always put it in, also a sprig
of mint, to be removed when the peas are dished. Drain well, and dish,
with a great lump of butter stirred in, and a little pepper. Keep hot.
