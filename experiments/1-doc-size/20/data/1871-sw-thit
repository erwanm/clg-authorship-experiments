of the river and all, because God made them? and you thought I ought to
like poor people and things for the same reason."
"O, that!" said Norton. "Well, why don't you?"
"That is what I could not tell, Norton, and I was puzzling to find out;
and now I know."
"Well, why?"
"Because, God did not make them, Norton."
"Yes, he did. Doesn't he make everything?"
"In one way he does, to be sure; but then, Norton, if everybody did
just right, there would be no poor people in the world; so it is not
something that God has made, but something that comes because people
won't do right."
"How?" said Norton.
"Why Norton, you know yourself. If everybody was good and loved
everybody else as well as himself, the people who have more than enough
would give to the people who are in want, and there would not be
uncomfortable poor people anywhere. And that is what the Bible says.
'He that hath two coats,'--don't you remember?"
"No, I don't," said Norton. "Most people have two coats, that can
afford it. What ought they to do?"
