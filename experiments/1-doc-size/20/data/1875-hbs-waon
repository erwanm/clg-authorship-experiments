"And we've got both kinds of trouble in our family. Eva's husband is
reading all What's-his-name's works--that evolution man, and all that;
and then Eva and the girls going after this St. John--and he's leading
them as straight to Rome as they can go."

Poor Mrs. Van Arsdel was somewhat fluttered by this alarming view of
the case, and clasped her pretty, fat, white hands, that glittered
with rings like lilies with dew-drops, and looked the image of gentle,
incapable perplexity.

"I don't believe Harry is an infidel," she said at last. "He has to
read Darwin and all those things, because he has to talk about them
in the magazine; and as to Mr. St. John--you know Eva is delicate and
can't walk so far as our church, and this is right round the corner
from her; and Mr. St. John is a good man. He does ever so much for the
poor, and almost supports a mission there; and the Bishop doesn't
forbid him, and if the Bishop thought there was any danger, he would."
