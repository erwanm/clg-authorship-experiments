The girl, silenced, looked at him without belief.

He said: "I am not surprised that you distrust what I say. But the man
you are going to marry was a junior officer in my command. I have no
closer friend than Jack Stormont. Ask him whether I am to be believed."

Astounded, the girl turned a flushed, incredulous face to Stormont.

He said: "You may trust Darragh as you trust me. I don't know what he
has to say to you, dear. But whatever he says will be the truth."

Darragh said, gravely: "Through a misunderstanding your father came into
possession of stolen property, Eve. He did not know it had been stolen.
I did. But Mike Clinch would not have believed me if I had told him that
the case of jewels in his possession had been stolen from a woman....
Quintana stole them. By accident they came into your father's
possession. I learned of this. I had promised this woman to recover her
jewels.
