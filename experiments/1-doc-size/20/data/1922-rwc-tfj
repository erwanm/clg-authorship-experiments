In the centre lay blazing the great Erosite gem,--the Flaming Jewel
itself. Priceless diamonds, sapphires, emeralds ringed it. In his hands
he held nearly four millions of dollars.

Gingerly he balanced the emblazoned case, fascinated. Then he replaced
the empty tray, closed the box, thrust it into the bosom of his flannel
shirt and buttoned it in.

Now there was little more for this excited young man to do. He was
through with Clinch. Hal Smith, hold-up man and dish-washer at Clinch's
Dump, had ended his career. The time had now arrived for him to vanish
and make room for James Darragh.

Because there still remained a very agreeable r√¥le for Darragh to play.
And he meant to eat it up--as Broadway has it.

For by this time the Grand Duchess of Esthonia--Ricca, as she was called
by her companion, Valentine, the pretty Countess Orloff-Strelwitz--must
have arrived in New York.
