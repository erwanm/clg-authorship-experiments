me very attentively, Karen!" And he tucked up his cuffs and made a few
short passes in the air. Then he smiled at her.
"Kervyn! I thought you meant to take them. Do you know you really did
frighten me?"
"I have got them," he said.
The colour came back into her cheeks; she smiled at him in a breathless
way.
"You did frighten me," she said. She came slowly back and seated herself
on the carpet of fir-needles. He sat down beside her.
"Karen, dear," he said, "you are a brick and I'm a brute. I took your
papers this morning. I had to, dear."
And he drew them from his breast pocket and showed them to her.
The girl sat in wide-eyed amazement for a moment. Suddenly her face
flushed and the tears flashed in her eyes.
"You have ridiculed me!" she said. "You have treated me like a child!"
"Karen----"
"I will not listen! I shall never listen to you again! You have played
with me, hurt me, humiliated me. You have ruled and overruled me! You
gained my friendship and treated it--and me--without ceremony. And I let
you! I must have been mad----"
