"A man must have money to make money. If now you had a little money----"

"I've got ten dollars to pay my expenses."

"Is that all?"

"No; I've got fifteen dollars to buy a shawl and dress for marm, and
some shirts for dad. He thought he'd like some boughten shirts. The
last marm made for him didn't fit very well."

"You must take good care of your money, Mr. Bascom. I regret to say
that we have a great many pickpockets in New York."

"So I've heerd. That's what Jim Duffy told me. He went to York last
spring. But I guess Jim was keerless or he wouldn't have been robbed.
It would take a smart pickpocket to rob me."

"Then you keep your money in a safe place?"
