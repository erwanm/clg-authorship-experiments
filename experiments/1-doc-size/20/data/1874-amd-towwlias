Ten days after his visit to Salem, he received a little note from Mr.
Thomas on this wise.

    "Bring me on Thursday morning, if you have them, three dozen roses,
    assorted colors, heliotrope, and fine sprays of fuchsia, if yours
    are still in bloom."

    "F. THOMAS."

Hal was delighted. Through September they had managed to get along on
the proceeds of their garden, and the fruit; but his first month's pay
had to go for clothes. It almost broke Granny's heart to take it.

"Why, I shall earn some more!" Hal exclaimed with his gay laugh. "It is
just what it is for, Granny, to spend. I'm thankful to be able to earn
it."

It was the middle of October now; and there had been some severe frost
already. Tender out-doors plants were a mass of blackened ruins.
