CHAPTER XXXVII


It was two o'clock and ten minutes. The eleven remaining spectators, one
of them a woman in evening dress, were sound asleep. The sheriff was
pacing up and down with his hands behind his back, his perturbed glance
ranging between the clock and the door leading into the jury-room.
Occasionally he slipped on a bit of the debris and kicked it aside. The
reporters slumbered at their tables or stared moodily ahead. One gnawed
his pencil; another tore leaves of copy paper into morsels and
laboriously built something that looked like a child's house of blocks.
Outside it was deathly still. The snow was falling softly. It was too
early for a cock-crow. Occasionally some one snored. The footfalls of
the sheriff made no noise.

Suddenly every reporter present sat up with the scent of blood in his
nostrils. Their ears twitched. The fumes blew out of their highly
organised brains like mist before a bracing wind. An automobile was
dashing down the road, its horn shrieking a series of brief peremptory
notes, which sounded like "Wait! Wait! Wait!"
