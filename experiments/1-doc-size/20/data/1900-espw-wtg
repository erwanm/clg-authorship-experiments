friend--the gentlest, the most obedient,
most trustful, the bravest patient I ever
had--Mrs. Fayth. I saw her face as the carriage
went over.... She stretched out her
hands, and said: “Doctor!” It was Mary
Fayth. (His face falls into his hands.
For a moment he sinks down on the wreck of
the buggy; but springs up.) Now that accounts
for it.--The crowd are all there. The
accident was so bad nobody has thought of
me. She is the victim. I have escaped.
Dead or alive, she is done for. She never
could recover from a shock like that. I
must go and find her. I must find Mrs.
Fayth. (Starts and hurriedly walks down
the street, peering everywhere.)

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

(In his absence no person passes the street.)
