side, the fasting and prayer, must originate in the other sex.  It never
does if we betray such symptoms.  They always wait to see whether we’ll
break out.  And when we do they treat us as though we were sick—kindly
but condescendingly.  You get me?"

"Vaguely."

"All right.  But here’s the other aspect: when we fall in love, and say
so, and then take the object of our vows gayly, amiably, and with
perfect good humor always—no matter how inwardly we doubt and fear and
rage—then, Michael, the girl we worship becomes very, very
serious—even ponderous at times—and if she’s got any brain at all it
gets busy and remains busy.  And what preoccupies her mind are questions
concerning whether or not you really do love her seriously enough; and,
if not, whether she can make you do it, which state of intellect causes
perpetual anxiety and chronic uncertainty. And only when these emotions
perpetually preoccupy a girl, can she finally fall in love with you
sufficiently to forget what an ass you really are."
