Finally, in concluding this picture of our present-day sex arrangements,
there is a brief word to be said about divorce. In the year 1916, the
last statistics available as I write, there were just over a million
marriages in the United States, and there were over one hundred and
twelve thousand divorces. This would indicate that one marriage in every
nine resulted in shipwreck. But as a matter of fact the proportion is
greater, because the marriages necessarily precede the divorces, and the
proportion of divorces in 1916 should be calculated upon the number of
marriages which took place some five or ten years previously. Of the one
million marriages in 1916, we may say that one in seven or one in eight
will end in the divorce courts. Let this suffice for a glimpse of the
system of marriage-plus-prostitution--a field of weeds which we have
somehow to plow up and prepare for a harvest of rational and honest
love!
