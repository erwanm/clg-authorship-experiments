'You have had many suitors,' he said at last, 'and it is said that your
father has given you your own free choice, allowing you to see them and
hear them speak while he was receiving them. Tell me why you have chosen
me rather than the rest, unless it is because you love me? For I came
with empty hands, and without servants or slaves, or retinue of any
kind, riding alone out of the Red Desert. It was therefore for myself
that you took me.'
'You are right. It was for yourself that I took you.'
'Then it was for love of me, was it not?'
'There were and still are many and good reasons,' answered Zehowah
calmly, and at the same time withdrawing her hand from his and smoothing
back the black hair from her forehead. 'I told them all to my father,
and he was convinced.'
'Tell them to me also,' said Khaled.
So she explained all to him in detail, making him see everything as she
saw it herself. And the explanation was so very clear, that Khaled felt
a cold chill in his heart as he understood that she had chosen him
rather for politic reasons, than because she wished him for her husband.
'And yet,' she added at the end, 'it was the will of Allah, for
otherwise I would not have chosen you.'
