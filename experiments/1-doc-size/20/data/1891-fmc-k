'If they destroy me, yet they cannot take the kingdom from you, nor hurt
you,' said Khaled. 'How then are you in danger? If I am slain you will
then choose a husband, whose father's name is known to them. They will
be satisfied and you will be no worse off than before and possibly
better. This is truth. I will therefore wait for the end.'

'Who has put these words into your mouth, Khaled? For the thought is not
in your heart. Moreover, if the tribes should rise up and overthrow you,
they would not spare me, for I would fight against them with my hands
and they would kill me.'

'Why should you fight for me, since you do not love me? But this is
folly. No one ever heard of a woman taking arms and fighting.'

'I have heard of such deeds. And if I had not heard of them, others
should through me, for I would be the first to do them.'

'I think that so long as Khaled lives, Zehowah need not bear arms,' said
Khaled. 'I will therefore go and call the chief men together and speak
to them.'
