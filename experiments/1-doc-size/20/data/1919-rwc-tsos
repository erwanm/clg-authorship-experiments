face flushed red.
"Bargain or no bargain," he said, "I don't want you to go because I'm
afraid you can not endure another shock like the last one.... And every
time you have thrown your own mind and body between this Nation and
destruction you have nearly died of it."
"And if I die?" she said in a low voice.
What answer she awaited--perhaps hoped for--was not the one he made. He
said: "If you die in what you believe to be your line of duty, then it
will be I who have killed you."
"That would not be true. It is you who have saved me."
"I have not. I have done nothing except to lead you into danger of death
since I first met you. If you mean spiritually, that also is untrue. You
have saved yourself--if that indeed were necessary. You have redeemed
yourself--if it is true you needed redemption--which I never
believed----"
"Oh," she sighed swiftly, "Sanang surprised my soul when it was free of
my body--followed my soul into the Wood of the White Moth--caught it
there all alone--and--slew it!"
His lips and throat had gone dry as he watched the pallid terror grow in
her face.
