and insult--of all three of which you have been guilty."

"We will not bandy words on that subject, Mr. Jasper," said Claire--"I
simply deny that I have been guilty of either of the faults you
allege. As for an investigation into my business conduct, that you can
do as early and as thoroughly as you please. I shall feel no anxiety
for the result."

Jasper did not reply. For a few moments the young man stood as if
expecting some remark; none being made, he turned away, gathered
together a few articles that were his own private property, tied
them into a bundle and marked his name thereon. Then bowing to the
merchant, he retired--oppressed from recent painful excitement, yet
glad, in his inmost feelings, that a connection so dangerous as that
with Jasper had been dissolved--dissolved even at the cost of making
an enemy.
