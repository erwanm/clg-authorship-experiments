Constance : " Yes, I know it ; it 's because I Ve 
none." She remains a little space without speak- 
ing, while she softly fingers the edges of the fan 
lying in her lap. " I suppose we shall become 
more acquainted, if he stays ? " 
Mrs. Wyatt : " Why, not necessarily, dear. You 
need know nothing more of him than you do now. 
He seems very busy, and not in the least inclined 
to intrude upon us. Your father thinks him a little 
odd, but very gentlemanly." 
Constance, dreamily : " I wonder what he would 
think if he knew that the man whom I would have 
given ray life did not find my love worth having? 
I suppose it was worthless ; but it seemed so 
much in the giving ; it was that deceived me. He 
was wiser. Oh, me ! " After a silence : " Mother, 
why was I so different from other girls ? " 
Mrs. Wyatt : " So different, Constance ? You 
were only different in being lovelier and better 
than others."
