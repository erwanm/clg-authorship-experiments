by wishing for them. And as there are so many 
birthdays, ten in all, it would keep one much of 
the time studying what to give, so, instead of that, 
we will have a special little feast for each child, 
and no regular gifts to be expected. We want you

and all the indulgences you have ought to satisfy 
any household.” 

“ Oh, Mother ! Oh, Mother ! ” and they all 
thronged around her, almost smothering her with 
kisses.

and began the distribution of gifts. There was 
the long-wished-for doll and the carriage, also one 
for Laurel, and a box of dishes. 

Now, children, you both have the same things, 
and I hope there will be no more disputes.”
