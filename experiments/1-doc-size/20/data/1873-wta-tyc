"Did you own the Juno?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you buy her of Captain Shivernock?"
"No, sir; I did not buy her; he made me a present of her."
"A present!"
"Yes, sir; he got disgusted with her, and gave her to me. I could not
afford to keep her, and sold her to Laud Cavendish."
"Gave her to you! That's very strange."
"But Captain Shivernock is a very strange man."
"None will dispute that," replied Captain Patterdale, with a smile and a
shrug of the shoulders. "That man throws away his property with utter
recklessness; and I should not be surprised if he ended his life in the
almshouse. I will not ask any explanation of the conduct of Captain
Shivernock. Laud Cavendish is not a man of means. Did he tell you,
Donald, where he got his money to buy a boat worth three hundred and
fifty dollars?"
"He did, sir, and explained the matter so that I was satisfied; for I
would not sell him the Juno till he convinced me that there was no hitch
about the money."
"Well, where did he get it?"
