"Can't tell its uncle!--there's a pretty go! Perhaps you will tell

bitterly.

monk; "let your old uncle try to help you."

feelings,--"it is not for myself,--it is for another,--for a soul lost.
Ah, my Jesus, have mercy!"

"A soul lost? Our Mother forbid!" said the monk, crossing himself.
"Lost in this Christian land, so overflowing with the beauty of the
Lord?--lost out of this fair sheepfold of Paradise?"
