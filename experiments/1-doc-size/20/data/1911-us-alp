again. It plays havoc with me as a rule ; and yet 
sometimes, when I'm not too exhausted, there is a certain 
joy in watching by the dim candle light the rosy up- 
turned face and the little groping mouth. Oh Thyrsis, 
he is all mine and yours, and we must make him glad 
he was borned, mustn't we?"

was almost prostrated with exhaustion ; and great waves 
of loneliness and yearning would sweep over him. Ah 
God, what a fate it was to labor as he labored, and 
then to have no means of recreation or respite, no hand 





to smooth his forehead, no voice to whisper solace! 
Who could know the tragedy of that aspect of his life ?
