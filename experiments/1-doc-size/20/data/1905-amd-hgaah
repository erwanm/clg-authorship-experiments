for US. We have lengthened out our holiday, and 
I hope you have had a good time." 

"And you are just lovely!" declared one en- 
thusiastic girl presently. "The clock is striking 
ten and you lengthen out the indulgence. Will 
you give us another half -hour?" 

"We are just a family now and not a school," 
said Mrs. Aldred. "And, girls, you cannot think 
how gratifying it is to have you so glad to come 
back, so eager to go on with your studies, so am- 
bitious, so cordial to each other. I hope it will be 
a happy and successful year, and that we shall not 
only strive for some new virtues, but practise 
those we have already acquired, that our char- 
acters may not be like the shifting sand of the sea 
shore, sparkling, fascinating but forever chang- 
ing. And now you may have your half-hour for 
singing."
