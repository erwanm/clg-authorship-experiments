father and mother talking together in a remote cor 
ner of the music-room and had stolen light-footedly 
upon them just at this moment. 
"Lottie, child," said her mother, undismayed at 
Lottie 's arrival in her larger anxiety, "I wish you 
would try and be agreeable to Mr. Breckon. Now 
that he 's going on with us to Holland, I don 't want 
him to think we 're avoiding him." 
"Why?" 
" Oh, because." 
" Because you want to get him for Ellen ?" 
" Don 't be impudent," said her father. " You do 
as your mother bids you." 
" Be agreeable to that old Breckon ? I think I see 
myself! I d sooner read! I 'm going to get a 
book now" She left them as abruptly as she had 
come upon them, and ran across to the bookcase, 
where she remained two - stepping and peering 
through the glass doors at the literature within, 
in unaccustomed question concerning it.
