"I think," she suggested, quietly, "that, if you care to stretch, I
wouldn't mind it, either. Can you do it discreetly?"
"I'll try," he said in a whisper. "Shall I count three?"
She nodded.
"One, two, three," he counted, and they cautiously stretched their legs.
"I now know how the Siamese twins felt," he said, sullenly. "No wonder
they died young."
She laughed--a curious, little laugh which was one of the most agreeable
sounds he had ever heard.
"I take it for granted," he said, "that you will always cherish for me a
wholesome and natural hatred."
"I shall never see you again," she replied, simply.
That silenced him for a while; he fished about in his intellect to find
mitigating circumstances. There was none that he knew of.
"Suppose--under pleasanter auspices, we should some day meet?" he
suggested.
"We never shall."
"How do you know?"
"It is scarcely worth while speculating upon such an improbability," she
said, coldly.
