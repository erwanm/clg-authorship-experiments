" How tired you must be, dear Miss Alice, carrying pussy !" 
Ellen said with a sigh. 
For the first time Alice echoed the sigh ; but almost imme- 
diately Ellen exclaimed in a totally different tone, " There's a 
light ! — but it isn't a candle — it is moving about ; — what is 
it ? what is it, Miss Alice ?" 
They stopped and looked. A light there certainly was, 
dimly seen, moving at some little distance from the fence on 
the opposite side of the road. All of a sudden it disappeared. 
* What is it?" whispered Ellen fearfully. 
" I don't know, my love, yet ; wait — " 
They waited several minutes. 
" What could it be?" said Ellen. "It was certainly a 
light, — I saw it as plainly as ever I saw anything ; — what 
can it have done with itself — there it is again ! — going the 
other way !" 
Alice waited no longer, but screamed out, " Who's there ?" 
But the light paid no attention to her cry ; it traveled on. 
" Halloo !" called Alice again as loud as she could. 
" Halloo !" answered a rough deep voice. The light suddenly stopped.
