for." 
" Are they the things you talk about with your 
cousin ? " 
" You should not say things to me against my 
cousin, Mr. Brand," said Gertrude. 4t That is 
dishonorable." 
He listened to this respectfully ; then he an- 
swered, with a little vibration of the voice, 4t I 
should be very sorry to do anything dishonorable. 
But I don't see why it is dishonorable to say that 
your cousin is frivolous." 
" Go and say it to himself ! " 
" I think he would admit it," said Mr. Brand. 
" That is the tone he would take. He would not 
be ashamed of it." 
" Then I am not ashamed of it ! " Gertrude 
declared. " That is probably what I like him for. 
I am frivolous myself." 
" You are trying, as I said just now, to lower 
yourself."
