about their own post-office, than the poor fishers of Quapaw. There is

should not like to tell you."
The doctor got up and took his old position on the carpet rug, a very
slight air of haughty displeasure mixing with his habitual indolent
gracefulness.
"This is your knight, Miss Derrick! Apparently the proverb of 'friends'
friends' does not hold good with him. When you are a little older, sir,
you will know--if you grow correspondingly wiser--that the fishers of
Quapaw or of any other point are precisely the people to know in such a
matter what the gentlemen whom it more nearly concerns, cannot get at;
and you have yourself given the reason."
Faith looked at Reuben with a little inquiring wonder. But he made no
answer, either to her look or the doctor's words; indeed perhaps did
not see the former, for his own eyes were cast down. He stood there,
the fingers of both hands lightly interlaced, his face quiet to the
last degree of immovability. The doctor's first words, to Faith, had
brought a moment's flush to his cheeks, but it had passed with the
moment; gravity and steadiness and truth were all that remained. The
doctor recognized them all, but all as adverse or opposition forces.
