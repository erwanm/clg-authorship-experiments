of sail she carried, but hardly leaving a wake in the blue waters behind
her. The hummocks and the low land of the shores of Holland and Belgium
were in sight; but, with the present breeze, there was but little hope
of reaching the mouth of the Scheldt that night, though it was hardly
twenty miles distant.
The regular course of instruction was in progress in both vessels, the
starboard watch of each being in the steerage, attending to their
studies, while the port watch were on deck, in charge of the sailing
department. Mr. Lowington paced the deck of the ship, and, with the
habit of an old sailor, frequently cast his eyes aloft to see what sails
were drawing. Occasionally, from a custom begotten of his solicitude for
his charge, he glanced at the Josephine.
The squadron did not make even a mile an hour; and when the watch was
changed, at four o'clock, there was not a breath of air to ruffle the
glassy waves. The ship rolled and pitched on the swells, and the sails
slapped against the masts and rigging under the effect of her motion.
The young seamen on deck, without being in a hurry, were annoyed and
vexed, as all sailors are in a calm. They partook of the heaviness of
the scene, and gaped and yawned, from mere inactivity, and the want of
something to occupy their minds.
