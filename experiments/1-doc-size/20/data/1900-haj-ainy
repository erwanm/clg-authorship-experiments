The Missing Will.
An hour after the depart of the colonel there was an unexpected
arrival.
A well-dressed gentleman descended the stairs gingerly, looked about
him with fastidious disdain, and walked up to the bar.
Tim Bolton was filling an order, and did not immediately observe him.
When at length he turned around he exclaimed, in some surprise:
"Mr. Waring!"
"Yes, Bolton, I have found my way here."
"I have been expecting you."
"I came to you for some information."
"Well, ask your questions: I don't know whether I can answer them."
"First, where is my Cousin Florence?"
"How should I know? She wasn't likely to place herself under my
protection."
"She's with that boy of yours--Dodger, I believe you call him. Where
is he?"
"Run away," answered Bolton, briefly.
"Do you mean that you don't know where he is?"
"Yes, I do mean that. I haven't set my eyes on him since that night."
