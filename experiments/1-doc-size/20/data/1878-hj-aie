" I dare say he could. Beaumont often comes here. 
Don 't you think you could find him, Woodley ? 
Make a dive into the crowd." 

" Thank you ; I have had enough diving," said 
Willie Woodley. " I will wait till Mr. Beaumont 
comes to the surface." 

" I will bring him to see you," said Lord Lam 
beth ; " where are you staying ?" 

" You will find the address in my letter Jones 's 
Hotel." 

"Oh, one of those places just out of Picca 
dilly ? Beastly hole, isn't it ?" Lord Lambeth in 
quired. 

"I believe it 's the best hotel in London," said 
Mrs. Westgate.
