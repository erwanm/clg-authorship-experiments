"Yes, Dr. Sandford;  but "
"But what, if you will be so good?"
"I think it was right for me to get it."
"I am sorry I do not agree with you at all. It was for me to
get it  I am supplied with funds, Daisy  and your father has
entrusted to me the making of all arrangements which are in
any way good for your comfort. I think, with your leave, I
shall reverse these bargains. Have you been all this time
pleasing Margaret and not yourself?"
"No, sir," I said,  "if you please. I cannot explain it, Dr.
Sandford; but I know it is right."
"What is right, Daisy? My faculties are stupid."
"No, sir; but  let it be as it is, please."
"But won't you explain it? I ought to know what I am giving my
consent to, Daisy; for just now I am constituted your
guardian. What has Margaret to do with your cloaks? There is
enough for both."
"But," said I, in a great deal of difficulty,  "there is not
enough for me and everybody."
"Are you going to take care of the wants of everybody?"
