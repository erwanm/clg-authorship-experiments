adorned with this most exquisite and rare adornment, had--gone to
sleep!"
"And for once," said Mrs. Somers, "you preferred the wearer to the
jewels and--went into a trance! I can imagine you!"
"I? not I!"--said the doctor--"I went up stairs. But you have no idea
of the effect."
Faith had been experiencing some of the scattering fire of society,
which hits no one knows where and no one knows when. First the name of
Phil Davids had ploughed up the ground at her right; then the question
about the man who had fired the shot had ploughed up the ground at her
left; and shaken first by one and then by the other she had welcomed
the doctor's change of subject and now was smiling as pleased as
anybody.
"I didn't suppose the trance was a long one," said Mrs. Somers, with a
little raising of her eyebrows. "Faith, my dear, what have you done to
that little Seacomb child? I can't get over my astonishment at his
transformation."
"I am afraid there isn't much transformation yet," Faith said. "He
listens very quietly and behaves well in school--but I don't know how
he is at home."
