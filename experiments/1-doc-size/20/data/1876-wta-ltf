Before I went to the bank the next morning I decided to write one more
note—one which could not fail to bring the unpleasant matter to an
issue within twenty-four hours. It was in the form of an advertisement,
as follows:—

 “Whereas, my wife, Lilian O. Glasswood, has left my bed and board,
 without justifiable cause, I hereby give notice that I shall pay no
 debts of her contracting, after this date.

  “Boston, Aug.—.    PALEY GLASSWOOD.

 “Shall I insert the above in to-morrow’s papers?

  P. G.”

I sent this epistle to Mr. Oliphant’s by Biddy. Though it was directed
to Lilian, it was intended for her mother.
