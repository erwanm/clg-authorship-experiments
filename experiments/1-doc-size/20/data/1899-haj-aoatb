His worst fears were realized. The bank books and certificate of stock
had been removed. Not a trace of them was to be found. The poor man,
for he was to be pitied, uttered a sharp cry of anguish. The clothes
dropped from his nerveless hands, and he fell back on the bed as if
stricken with a mortal wound.
“Help! Help! Police!” he ejaculated. “I’ve been robbed.”
“Robbed is it?” inquired Mrs. Hogan, puzzled. “And of what have you
been robbed, ould man?”
“There were two savings bank books in the pockets. You’ve taken them!”
“Well, well, if I ever heard the loike!” exclaimed Mrs. Hogan,
indignantly. “So you call me a thafe, do you?”
“Give them back to me!” said the old man, imploringly. “I--I am so
poor. It will kill me if I lose my money.”
“Two savings bank books, indade!” said Mrs. Hogan. “It’s my belafe
you’re an ould humbug, you that have always called yourself so poor.
And how much money was there in them?” she asked.
“I--I--no matter. Give me the books, or I’ll send for the police.”
“Go and welcome, this minute, if you please. You ought to know better
than to call an honest woman a thafe.”
“Somebody has taken the books,” wailed Jerry.
