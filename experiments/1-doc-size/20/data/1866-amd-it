person, so little did he realize the great shadow ^fallen upon 
him. 
Ada turned to Mr. Livingston with an easy grac, and 
as if some explanation was needed, said, nonchalantly, 
" For two years I have been engaged to Dr. Bertrand 
a girlish fancy that I have outlived in the last six months. 
We have just dissolved the bond." 
He bowed with a pleased look. There was nothing for 
her to regret in the exchange. Of late, she had felt tho 
position Dr. Bertrand's wife must fill was very little to her 
liking. Here was a man to whom she would be first always, 
superior to her old lover in those points she cared most for. 
She could retain her position in society; no troublesome 
domestic details would ever be forced upon her, and life 
would prove a perfect round of pleasure. Although she 
inwardly congratulated herself on her improved prospects, 
she gave a pitying thought to Richard, and said to her- 
self, " I could have made him very happy if he had not been 
so set upon those foolish whims." She was relieved to learn 
that he left early the next morning.
