beg. He would find work. 
And so on through the morning. He went 
into stores, big and httle. Sometimes they an- 
swered politely — sometimes gruffly; but no one 
hesitated a moment. He went past warehouses, 
where men were loading wagons — surely there 
would be work here. 
He spoke to a busy foreman in his shirt sleeves. 
" How often must I tell you no? " cried the 
man. 
" But you never told me before," protested 
Samuel with great earnestness. 
" Get out! " said the man. " There are so many 
of you — how the devil can I tell? " 
There were so many! And suddenly Samuel 
realized that he had passed a good many poor- 
looking men upon the streets. And were they all 
hunting jobs and not finding them? Perhaps 
some were even begging and getting nothing by 
that.
