readings, she had lectured a little, but she was eager for 
higher work. Mrs. Townsend, with all her experience, 
might see an opening or suggest some course — 
Gertrude listened attentively, and made a few notes, 
took the name and address and explained that Mrs. 
Townsend had but recently returned to the city, and 
found so much to do, had to meet so many people, and 
had very little leisure. She would lay the case before 
her, but there was not much doing in the summer, and 
if there was any opening for autumn, Mrs. Townsend 
would do what she could for her. 
Gertrude felt sorry for the tired-looking, unprepossess- 
 
ing girl. To be a success one did need attractiveness, or 
a high order of genius that made itself felt at once. She 
was really thankful she had no wild ambitions for herself, 
and was satisfied with the work that had come to her. 
And what a splendid year it had been — not all rose color 
or heart' s-ease, but she had grown used to the thorny side 
and the little pricks.
