were smooth and not broken by any latch or keyhole. The 
spring was on the outside, and there was no means whatever 
of opening the door from within. 
Giovanni wondered why a special messenger was to be 
employed to carry any request he made directly to the 
cardinal. The direction could not have been given idly, nor was 
it without some especial reason that he was at once told of it. 
Assuredly his Eminence was not expecting the prince to 
repent of his bargain and to send word that he wished to 
be released. The idea was absurd. The great man might 
suppose, however, that Giovanni would desire to send some 
communication to his wife, who would naturally be anxious 
about his absence. Against this contingency, however, Sant' 
Ilario had provided by means of the note he had despatched 
to her. Several days would elapse before she began to 
expect him, so that he had plenty of time to reflect upon his 
future course. Meanwhile he resolved to ask for nothing. 
Indeed, he had no requirements. He had money in his 
pockets and could send the attendant to buy any linen he 
needed without getting it from his home.
