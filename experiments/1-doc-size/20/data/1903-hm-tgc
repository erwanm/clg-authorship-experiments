of the hand fascinated him.  "Are your ears like the sailors' of
Ulysses, filled with wax?  I am asking you to pick up my gauntlet."

As he stooped to obey the command, a laugh sounded behind him, and he
knew that he had been tricked.  The little musketeer had vanished.  For
a moment he was disturbed.  In vain he searched the gauntlet for some
distinguishing sign.  But as reason told him that no harm could
possibly come from the prank, his fears subsided, and he laughed.  On
being relieved from duty, later, he sought her, to return the gauntlet.
She was talking to Mademoiselle de Longueville.  As she saw the
Chevalier, she moved away.  The Chevalier, determined on seeing the
adventure to its end, followed her deliberately.  She sat in a
window-seat.  Without ceremony he sat down beside her.

"Monsieur," he said, smiling, and he was very handsome when he smiled,
"permit me to return this gauntlet."

She folded her arms, and this movement of her shoulders told him that
she was laughing silently.
