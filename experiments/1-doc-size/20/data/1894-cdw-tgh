ing question, apropos of Henderson's successful 
career : " Mavick, why don't you get married ?" 

" I have never," he replied, with his usual cynical 
deliberation, " been obliged to. The fact is, mar- 
riage is a curb-bit. Some horses show off better 
with it, and some are enraged and kick over the 
traces. I cannot decide which I would be." 

" That's true enough," said Jack, " from a bache- 
lor's point of view of independence, but it's really 
a question of matching." 

" The most difficult thing. in the world in horses. 
Just about impossible in temperament and move- 
ment, let alone looks. Most men are lucky if they 
get, like Henderson, a running mate."
