force on the forward deck, in readiness to disembark them.
Presently the steamer reached the point at which the Indians had
landed. The dugouts were hauled up on the shore; but we could see
nothing of the savages, who had disappeared in the forest, half a mile
from the stream, where the land began to rise.
"Can we make a landing here?" asked the captain.
"You can," I replied.
"Do so, captain," added Lieutenant Pope.
"I wouldn't land here," I interposed.
"Why not?"
"This boat can go three miles up the river, sure, and perhaps five. The
Indians must travel up stream in order to escape you. If you go up two
miles farther, you can head them off."
"Keep her a-going, captain," added the officer.
"Two or three miles east of us is Big Fish Creek. The Indians can't get
across below us without swimming."
"Then we shall have them between these two streams."
"Of course it is possible for them to get across the Big Fish, but it
won't be very easy, unless they get rid of their prisoner."
"How far is it across the country to the creek?" asked the lieutenant.
