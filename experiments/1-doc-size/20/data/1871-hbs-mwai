as good a time as you can, and do everything that is agreeable, and make
everything just as pretty as it can be. And I think it is fun to trim up
the church for Easter. There now! And it don't do any harm. And I just
like to go to the sunrise service, if it does make one sleepy all day.
What do you say, Mr. Fellows? Do you think you could go through with the
whole of it?"
"Miss Alice, if you only go you will find me inspired with the spirit of
a primitive Christian in this respect," said Jim. "I shall follow
wherever you lead the way, if it's ever so late at night, or ever so
early in the morning."
"And Mr. Henderson," said she, "may we depend on you, too?"
"By all means," said I, as I sat industriously gathering up the lilies
into bunches and tying them.
"Mr. Henderson is in a hopeful way," said Eva. "I think we may have him
in the true church some of these times."
"I am afraid," said Ida, "that Mr. Henderson, having seen you only in
Lent, won't be able to keep track of you when the Easter rejoicings
begin, and the parties recommence."
"Oh dear me!" said Eva, with a sort of shudder, "To think of that horrid
wedding!"
