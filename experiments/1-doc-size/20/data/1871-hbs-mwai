great power. Yet just now it is power without responsibility. It is in
the hands of men who come under no pledge, pass no examination, give no
vouchers, though they hold a power more than that of all other
professions or books united. One cannot be a doctor, or a lawyer, or a
minister, unless some body of his fellows looks into his fitness to
serve society in these ways; but one may be turned loose to talk in
every family twice a day, on every subject, sacred and profane, and say
anything he chooses without even the safeguard of a personal
responsibility. He shall speak from behind a screen and not be known.
Now you know old Dante says that the souls in the other world were
divided into three classes, those who were for God and those who were
for the Devil, and those who were for neither, but for themselves. It
seems to me that there's a vast many of these latter at work in our
press--smart literary adventurers, who don't care a copper what they
write up or what they write down, wholly indifferent which side of a
question they sustain, so they do it smartly, and ready to sell their
wit, their genius and their rhetoric to the highest bidder. Now, Harry,
I'd rather see you a poor, threadbare, hard-worked, country minister
than the smartest and brightest fellow that ever kept his talents on
sale in Vanity Fair."
