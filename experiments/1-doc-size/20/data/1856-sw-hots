have a short sight of Winthrop and Winifred and say good-bye
to them. It was not so joyful a visit that anybody wished it
to be a long one.
"It's pretty hard," said the farmer, "to start life anew again
at my time of day; -- but these arms are not worn out yet; I
guess they'll do something -- more or less -- on a new field."
"Asahel's got strong arms, father," said Winifred, who was
fain to put in a word of comfort when she could.
"Ay, and a strong heart too," said his father. "He's a fine
fellow. He'll do, I guess, in the long run, -- at the West or
somewhere; and at the West if anywhere, they say. I'm not
concerned much about him."
"There's no need, I think," said Winthrop.
"Where's Will? -- and what's he doing?"
"Will has just set off for Charleston -- on some agency
business."
"Charleston in South Carolina?"
"Yes."
"Then he is not engineering now?"
"No."
