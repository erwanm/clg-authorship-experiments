It was Sally's luck, this evening, to play the undesigning 
eaves-dropper. While Colonel Floyd and Booker held their 
cautious colloquy upon the porch, she was within ear-shot 
of most that was said. She had been to the kitchen upon 
some trifling errand, and was on her way back to Helen's 
room, when she espied Booker peeping in at the hall door, 
either watching or waiting for some one within. Sally in 
stantly crouched, like a hare upon her form, and, inch by 
inch, crept under the portico steps, not with the intention 
of overhearing what might follow, but to keep out of the 
plan's sight, and to avoid the chance of meeting him. She 
ated and feared him, not without sufficient cause, as the 
eader will allow, and was panic-stricken by the thought 
hat if she encountered him at this juncture of the plot confided to her keeping, he might drag the whole truth out of 
ler. She believed him to be possessed of the craft, as he 
vas of the depravity, of the great adversary of mankind.
