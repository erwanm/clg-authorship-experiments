said anything. And he wanted to git away from 
the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the 
camel driver, just the way a person does when he 
has got catched in something and wants to take it 
out of somebody else. He let into the camel driver 
the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with 
him ; and he praised up the dervish the highest 
he could, and I had to agree with him there, too. 
But Tom says : 
 I ain't so sure. You call that dervish so 
dreadful liberal and good and unselfish, but I don't 
quite see it. He didn't hunt up another poor der- 
vish, did he ? No, he didn't. If he was so un- 
selfish, why didn't he go in there himself and take 
a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied ? 
No, sir ; the person he was hunting for was a man 
with a hundred camels. He wanted to get away 
with all the treasure he could ' 
' Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair 
and square ; he only struck for fifty camels.'
