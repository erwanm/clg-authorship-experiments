the judge; it was a young man; it was a person she had not seen; she
made these successive discoveries as she drew nearer. She decided that
it was a neighbor from one of the southern islands, who had taken
advantage of the lovely afternoon for a sail.
When she came up she found Miss Sabrina half laughing, half crying; she
had given the stranger both her hands. "Oh, Eve, it is Ferdinand. And I
did not know him!"
"How could you expect to know me, when you have never seen me in your
life?" asked the young man, laughing.
"But we have your picture. I ought to have known--"
"My dear aunt, never accuse yourself; your dearest friends will always
do that for you. I dare say my picture doesn't half do me justice."
He spoke jestingly; but there was still twilight enough to show Eve that
what he had said was simply the truth. The photograph was handsome, but
the real face was handsomer, the features beautiful, the eyes blue and
piercing.
"This is Cicely's sister Eve," said Miss Sabrina. "She has come out--so
kindly--from England to pay us a visit."
Ferdinand put out his hand with a bright smile. He had a smile which
would have been a fitting one for a typical figure of youthful Hope.
