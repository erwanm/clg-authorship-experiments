“General Snowdon was my father’s friend; he pitied me; he saw my
desolate, destitute state, my despair and helplessness. He comforted,
sustained, and saved me. I was grateful; and when he offered me his
heart and home, I accepted them. He knew I had no love to give; but as a
friend, a daughter, I would gladly serve him, and make his declining
years as happy as I could. It was all over, when I heard that you were
alive, afflicted, and poor. I longed to come and live for you. My new
bonds became heavy fetters then, my wealth oppressed me, and I was
doubly wretched--for I dared not tell my trouble, and it nearly drove me
mad. I have seen you now; I know that you are happy; I read your
cousin’s love and see a peaceful life in store for you. This must
content me, and I must learn to bear it as I can.”
She paused, breathless and pale, and walked rapidly along the terrace,
as if to hide or control the agitation that possessed her.
Treherne still sat silent, but his heart leaped within him, as he
thought, “She sees that Octavia loves me! A woman’s eye is quick to
detect love in another, and she asserts what I begin to hope. My
cousin’s manner just now, her dislike of Annon, her new shyness with me;
it may be true, and if it is--Heaven help me--what am I saying! I must
not hope, nor wish, nor dream; I must renounce and forget.”
