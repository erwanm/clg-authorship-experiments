sition had made just the difference that she lost the view 
of the other side of the piano, took a slight but immedi- 
ate stretch. ''Is Harold with Lady Fanny?" 
"You ask it, my dear child," said the Duchess, "as if 
it were too grand to be believed. It's the note of eager- 
ness," she went on for Mr. Longdon's benefit — " it's al- 
most the note of hope : one of those that ces messieurs, 
that we all, in fact, delight in and find so matchless. She 
desires for Harold the highest advantages."
''Well then' declared Vanderbank, who had achieved" 
a glimpse, " he's clearly having them. It brings home to 
one his success.'' 
''His success is true," Mrs. Brook insisted. "Ho 
he does it I don't know." 
"Oh donH you !" trumpeted the Duchess. 
"He's amazing," Mrs. Brook pursued. "I watch — 
hold my breath. But I'm bound to say also I rather ad 
mire. He somehow amuses them." 
" She's as pleased as Punch," said the Duchess.
