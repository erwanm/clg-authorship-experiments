majesty of a great art, No ! 

Did Victor Hugo write a tract? He told 
an immortal story. Hold beside it the sketches 



and pastels, the etchings, the studies in dialect, 
the adoration of the incident, the dissection of 
the cadaver, which form the fashion in the 
ateliers of our schools to-day ! 

It has seemed to me, to return to the per 
sonal question, that so far as one is able to 
command attention at all, one's first duty in 
the effort to become a literary artist is to por 
tray the most important, not altogether the 
least important, features of the world he lives 
in.
