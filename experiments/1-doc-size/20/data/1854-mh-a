Ellen Morris burst into the school-room one morning in a gale of
excitement.

It was early, and none of the teachers were present, the girls were
gathered in knots about the stove and desks.

I have the best thing to tell you. You must know she and I were
invited, with several others, to take tea at Uncle James' last evening.
We had not been there long before aunt said that Mr. Dermott was
expected. 'I have it,' thought I. I gave Celestia a nudge, 'Do you hear
that?'

"'What?' said she.

"'The great traveller, Mr. Dermott, is to be here presently. Ain't you
glad?'

"'Who is he? I never heard of him.'
