"You were probably nearer right than he;" said Mr. Lacy. I do not decry
morality. Reason teaches us that the benevolent citizen, the honest
tradesman, the kind parent and husband, find more favour in the eyes of
a righteous judge than the rioter, the cheat, the debauchee and tyrant.
Much injury is done to religion by the mistaken zeal of its advocates.
This was not the spirit of its Founder. To me, the history of the young
ruler, who came to Christ, is one of the most affecting in the New
Testament. He was not driven away by disheartening rebukes; but 'Jesus,
looking on him, loved him.' How tenderly must he have uttered--'But
one thing thou lackest!'"

"But how unnatural is the finale!" said Lynn. "'And he went away
sorrowful, for he had great possessions.' He let his lucre outweigh his
soul!"

"Take care how you condemn!" said Charley. "There are 'possessions'
besides silver and gold, which clog a man's steps. Love of pleasure has
ruined more souls than love of gain."

"And procrastination more than both together;" added Morton.
