Cook and boil in salted water fifteen minutes; throw this off, and
cover with milk and water. Cook tender; drain; pepper and salt, and
pour in a cupful of drawn butter. Simmer five minutes, and turn out.


MASHED POTATOES.

Prepare in the usual manner, taking care not to get them too stiff.


FRIED HOMINY.

Boil hominy—the fine-grained—the day before you want to use it. When
perfectly cold and stiff, remove the skin from the top, and cut the
hominy into neat squares. Flour and salt these, and fry to a nice brown
in hot lard or dripping. Drain well, and eat hot.


SWEET POTATO PIE.
