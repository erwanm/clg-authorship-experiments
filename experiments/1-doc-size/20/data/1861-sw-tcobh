“ ‘Who are they whose little feet, 
Pacing life’s dark journey through, 
Now have reach’d that heavenly seat 
They had ever kept in view ? 
Each the welcome “ Come !” awaits, 
Conquerors over death and sin: 
Lift your heads, ye golden gates ! 
Let the little travellers in !’ 
“That is the sort of little feet I love, 
Debby, — the only ones that are really 
beautiful; and whether they wear red 
shoes or no shoes, does not make much 
difference. You may learn the whole 
hymn, if you like.” So Debby sat down 
to learn. 
“ CHILDREN AT THE GATE OF HEAVEN.” 
“Little travellers Zionward, 
Each one entering into rest, 
In the kingdom of your Lord, 
In the mansions of the blest;
