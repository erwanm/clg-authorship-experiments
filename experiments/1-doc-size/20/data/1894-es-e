with a motion at the safe : " There are 
those cheques. You have your choice go 
away or go to jail. You are warned for the 





last time. Myrrha shall never be your wife. 
Never. Do you hear me ? I shall tie up

shall tie it so that not a penny is hers. 
Independent of that, there are the cheques. 
You will leave Newport to-night, or I will 
have you under arrest." 

" You are hard, Mr. Attersol, very. You 
brought us up together, you "
