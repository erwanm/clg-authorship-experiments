"Well, what does he say? I want to know how he stands affected by the
present condition of affairs," continued the captain rather impatiently,
for he was too busy to enjoy the humor of the engineer.
"He is a thrifty Scotchman; and I don't believe he has any interest in
anything under the sun except his wages; and he is a little sour on that
account to find that his cruise is finished, as he puts it."
"Send for him and his assistants, Mr. Sampson."
The engineer went to the engine hatch, and called the men below.
"Now send for Mr. Gawl," added the captain. "He is your first assistant;
is he a competent man to run an engine?"
"As competent as I am myself; and the engine of this steamer is exactly
like that of the Bronx, so that he can have no trouble with it, if you
think of retaining him on board of the Ocklockonee," replied Sampson.
"I propose to make him chief engineer of her."
"You could not find a better man," said Sampson, as he went to summon
Gawl.
The three engineers of the prize came on deck, and the captain took the
chief aside.
"Mr. Bockburn, I believe, the chief engineer of the Ocklockonee?" said
Christy.
