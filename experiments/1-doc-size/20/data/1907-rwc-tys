"Yes; I have several--"
"Stay with me," she said in a low voice.
For a moment the words meant nothing; then blank surprise silenced him,
followed by curiosity.
"Is there something you wished to tell me?" he asked.
"N-no."
His perplexity and surprise grew. "Wait a second, Boots," he said; and
Mr. Lansing, being a fairly intelligent young man, went out and down the
stairway.
"Now," he said, too kindly, too soothingly, "what is it, Eileen?"
"Nothing. I thought--but I don't care. Please go, Captain Selwyn."
"No, I shall not until you tell me what troubles you."
"I can't."
"Try, Eileen."
"Why, it is nothing; truly it is nothing. . . . Only I was--it is so
early--only a quarter past eight--"
He stood there looking down at her, striving to understand.
"That is all," she said, flushing a trifle; "I can't read and I can't
sew and there's nobody here. . . . I don't mean to bother you--"
"Child," he exclaimed, "do you want me to stay?"
