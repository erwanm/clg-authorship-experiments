in surprise.
"A little match boy that was lyin' just outside the door. He looks as
if he might be dead."
Richard jumped at once from his stool, and, approaching the boy, looked
earnestly in his face.
"He has fainted away," he said, after a pause. "Bring some water,
quick!"
Micky brought a glass of water, which was thrown in the face of Mark.
The match boy gave a little shiver, and, opening his eyes, fixed them
upon Richard Hunter.
"Where am I?" he asked, vacantly.
"You are with friends," said Richard, gently. "You were found at our
door faint. Do you feel sick?"
"I feel weak," said Mark.
"Have you been well lately?"
"No, I've felt tired and weak."
"Are you a match boy?"
"Yes."
"Have you parents living?"
"No," said Mark.
