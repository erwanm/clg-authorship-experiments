she went away and sang Rock of Ages to the tune of 
Martyn, very slow, and quite on the wrong key. It 
seemed to make her feel better, poor thing. Jack some- 
times wondered why. 

When he was twelve years old he came home from a 
winter voyage one night, and got his pay for his share, 
— boy's pay, yet, for a boy's share ; but bigger than it 
used to be, — and did not go home first, but went
rollicking off with a crowd of Portuguese. It was a Sun- 
day night, and his mother was expecting him, for she 
knew the boat was in. His step-father expected him 

too, — and his money ; and Jack knew that. His mother 
had been sick, but Jack did not know that; she had been 
very sick, and had asked for him a great deal. There 
had been a baby, — born dead while its father was off- 
shore after cod, — and it had been very cold weather ; 
and something had gone wrong.
