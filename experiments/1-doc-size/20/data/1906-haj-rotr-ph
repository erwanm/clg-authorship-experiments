"He is not," answered the fashionable woman, coldly.
"I've got a search warrant for this place," said the constable, pushing
his way in, and he proceeded to read the document aloud.
"This is an outrage!" cried Mrs. Bangs, with assumed dignity. "An
outrage, and you shall pay dearly for it, Mr. Bartlett. My husband is
no thief, to steal your papers."
"Perhaps not," answered Philip Bartlett. "Nevertheless, I am going to
have his safe searched and also this house."
"Well, since you have the law on your side, go ahead. But you shall
answer to my husband for this indignity."
The constable began his work, and the safe opener approached the strong
box and inspected it.
"Can you open it?" asked Mr. Bartlett, anxiously.
"With ease," was the answer. "This is one of the old-style safes."
"How much will it cost?"
"Ten dollars."
"Then go ahead."
The safe opener was soon at work. He turned the knob around slowly,
listening intently in the meanwhile. He worked thus for perhaps ten
minutes, when the door to the safe came open without an effort.
