"Homeward."
"To Fonda's Bush?"
"Yes."

"Why do you ride by Mayfield?"
"Because he waits for me there."
"Why, Jack?"
"He has friends to visit----"
"At Mayfield?"
"At Pigeon-Wood," I muttered.
"More gallantry!" she said, tossing her head. "But young men must have
their fling, and I am not jealous of Betsy Browse or of her pretty
sister, so that you ride not toward Caughnawaga----"
"What?"
"To see this rustic beauty, Penelope Grant----"
