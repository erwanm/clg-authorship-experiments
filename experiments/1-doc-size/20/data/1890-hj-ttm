waiters. One of these functionaries approached them with 
eagerness and with a " Mesdames sont seules ? " receiving in 
return, from her ladyship, the slightly snappish announce- 
ment, " Non ; nous sommes beaucoup ! " He introduced them 
to a table larger than most of the others, and under his pro- 
tection they took their places at it and began, rather languidly 
 
and vaguely, to consider the question of the repast. The waiter 
had placed a carte in Lady Agnes's hands, and she studied it, 
through her eye-glass, with a failure of interest, while he 
enumerated, with professional fluency, the resources of the 
establishment and Grace looked at the people at the other 
tables. She was hungry and had already broken a morsel 
from a long glazed roll. 
" JSTot cold beef and pickles, you know," she observed to her 
mother. Lady Agnes gave no heed to this profane remark, . 
but she dropped her eye-glass and laid down the greasy docu- 
ment. " What does it signify ? I dare say it's all nasty," 
Grace continued ; and she added, inconsequently : " If Peter 
comes he's sure to be particular."
