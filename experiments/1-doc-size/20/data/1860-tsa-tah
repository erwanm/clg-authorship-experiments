qualification, bore me into the confidence of Mrs. Montgomery, and thus
opened the way for me to happiness and fortune. My good Blanche has
often repeated to me the language you once used in my favor, and which
awakened in her mind an interest which gradually deepened into love. My
heart moves towards you, Doctor, and you must let its impulses have way
in this small matter. Do not feel it as an obligation. That is all on
our side. We cannot let Ivy Cottage go entirely out of the family. We
wish to have as much property in it as the pilgrim has in Mecca. We must
visit it sometimes, and feel always that its chambers are the abodes of
peace and love. A kind Providence has given us of this world’s goods an
abundance. We did not even have to lift our hands to the ripe clusters.
They fell into our laps. And now, if, from our plenty, we take a small
portion and discharge a debt, will you push aside the offering, and say,
No? Doctor, this must not be!”

Again I essayed objection; but all was in vain. Ivy Cottage was to be
our pleasant home. When, on returning with Constance, I related to her
what had passed between Mr. Wallingford and myself, she was affected to
tears.
