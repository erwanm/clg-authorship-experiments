"You know, Monsieur Burley, you should 
not say tres chic to me," she said, shaking 
her pretty head. "It sounds a little familiar 
and a little common." 
"Oh," he exclaimed, very red. "I thought 
it was the thing to say." 
She smiled, continuing to shell the peas, 
then, with her sensitive and slightly flushed 
face still lowered, she looked at him out of 
her dark blue eyes. 
"Sometimes," she said, "young men say 
tres chic.  It depend on when and how one 
says it." 
"Are there times when it is all right for 
me to say it?" he inquired. 
"Yes, I think so. ... How are your mules 
today?" 
"The same," he said, " ready to bite or 
kick or eat their heads off. The Remount 
took two hundred this morning."
