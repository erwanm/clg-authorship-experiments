They went on in an antiphony of praise till March 
said, " Really, I don't see what 's left me but to 
strike for higher wages. I })erceive that I 'm 
indispensable." 

" Why, old man, you 're coming in on the divvy, 
you know," said Fulkcrson. 

They both laughed, and when Fulkcrson was 
gone, Mrs. March asked her husband what a divvy 
was. 

" It 's a chicken before it 's hatched." 

" No ! Truly ? " 

He explained, and she began to spend the divvy.
