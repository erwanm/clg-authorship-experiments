"That is excuse enough for anyone," and Carrington smiled, bowing a
polite dismissal.
"I am so glad to find you!" Annis said with childlike simplicity. "We
have missed you so much. Where have you been all this long time?"
"We? Who?" He bowed his head a little.
"Charles and I. And do you know Charles is ill and in the doctor's
hands at Philadelphia?"
"No; I have been away three months--up on the northern frontier and in
Boston. Poor Charles! Is he likely to recover?"
"He was to come home at Christmas, but he can't now," and she sighed a
little. "And papa too," irrelevantly thinking of his earlier question.
"We were all sorry."
"I don't think everybody could have been," after a little pause.
She raised her soft, beseeching eyes. "Are you still angry with
Jaqueline?" she asked. "I am sure she is sorry. Patty teases her and
says she will be an old maid because----"
Then Annis hung her pretty head.
"What makes you think she was sorry?"
He looked down into the eyes with an infinite persuasion, and his voice
had an accent hard to resist.
