They are cleaner and better dressed than the sailors on the Sultan's
fire-ships that lie in the Golden Horn, for I have seen them. They are
as clean as the young effendis in London, in Paris! It is wonderful!
You have not many on your ship, but you could have ten ships, all with
sailors like these, and they would be all well washed. I like clean
people. Yes, you are a great man.'
She turned her eyes away from him and gazed lazily at the still blue
sea, having apparently said all she had to say. Logotheti was well
used to Asiatics and understood that her speech was partly
conventional and intended to convey that sort of flattery which is
dear to the Oriental soul. Baraka knew perfectly well what a real king
was, and the difference between a yacht and a man-of-war, and many
other things which she had learned in Constantinople. Primitive
people, when they come from Asia, are not at all simple people, though
they are often very direct in pursuing what they want.
'I have something of importance to tell you,' Logotheti said after a
pause.
Baraka prepared herself against betraying surprise by letting her lids
droop a little, but that was all.
'Speak,' she answered. 'I desire knowledge more than gold.'
