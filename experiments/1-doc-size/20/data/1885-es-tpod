original views. He had, as has been intimated, a thorough contempt for
life: "It is," he said, "fit but to be despised." Nostra vita a che

combat the illusion which leads so many to imagine that were their
circumstances different, they would then be thoroughly content. This
idea is presented with vivacious ingenuity in a dialogue between a man
peddling calendars and a passer-by.
It runs somewhat as follows:--
    "Calendars! New calendars!"
    "For the coming year?"
    "Yes, sir."
    "Do you think the year will be a good one?"
    "Yes, indeed, sir."
    "As good as last year?"
    "Better, sir,--better."
    "As year before last?"
    "Much better, sir."
    "But wouldn't you care to have the next year like any of the
    past years?"
    "No, sir, I would not."
