to point out that Schopenhauer begins precisely where Kant left off.
Kant's great merit consisted in distinguishing the phenomenon from the
thing-in-itself, or in other words, in showing the difference between
that which seems and that which is.[8] For the inaccessible
thing-in-itself he had no explanation to offer. He called it the Ding
an sich, regarded it as the result of an unintelligible cause, and
then left it to be a bugbear to every student of his philosophy.

This unpleasant Ding an sich was exorcised, and well-nigh banished
for good and all, by Fichte and Hegel; but Schopenhauer reÃ«stablished
the incomprehensible factor on a fresh basis, christened it "Will," and
asserted it to be the creator of all that is, and at once independent,
free, and omnipotent; in other words, the interior essence of the world
of which Christ crucified is the sublime symbol. Thus disposed of, the
Ding an sich may now be left to take care of itself, and the
examination of the great theory begun.

Schopenhauer opens his philosophy with the formula, "The world is my
idea;" a formula which, it may be noted, condenses in the fewest
possible words all that is worth condensing of the idealism of Germany.
