couch. Why, I should die of fright before 
morning ! " 

"Fright! What can you find to be afraid 
of, I should like to know? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; robbers, and ghosts, 
and spiritual rappings, and fifty things. I have 
an aunt who saw her candlestick walk right 
out into the air off the mantelpiece, one night, 
and how do I know but that I should see mine 
walking, if I slept alone ! I always cover my 
head up in the clothes, anyway, and I always 
make Josephine sleep the front side; don't I, 
Jo?" 

"Were?" said contemptuous Gypsy, slowly. 
" If I enjoyed being an infant, I 'd be an infant, 
but it would be a good while before I would 
boast of it."
