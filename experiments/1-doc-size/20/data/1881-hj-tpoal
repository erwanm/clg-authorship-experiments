Merle added " don't tell her; she won't care." 
As Isabel drove, in the publicity of an open vehicle, along the 
charming winding way which led to Mr. Osmond's hill-top, she 
wondered what Madame Merle had meant by no one being the 
wiser. Once in a while, at large intervals, this lady, in whose 
discretion, as a general thing, there was something almost brilliant, 
dropped a remark of ambiguous quality, struck a note that 
sounded false. What cared Isabel Archer for the vulgar judg- 
ments of obscure people? and did Madame Merle suppose that 
she was capable of doing a deed in secret? Of course not she 
must have meant something else something which in the press 
of the hours that preceded her departure she had not had time 
to explain. Isabel would return to this some day ; there were 
certain things as to which she liked to be clear. She heard 
Pansy strumming at the piano in another apartment, as she 
herself was ushered into Mr. Osmond's drawing-room ; the little 
girl was " practising," and Isabel was pleased to think that she 
performed this duty faithfully. Presently Pansy came in, 
smoothing down her frock, and did the honours of her father's 
house with the wide-eyed conscientiousness of a sensitive child.
