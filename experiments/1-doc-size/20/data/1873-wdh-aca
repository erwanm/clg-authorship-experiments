Arbuton, she was determined not meanly to condemn him; she confessed to
herself, with a glimmer of her wonted humor, that her dress must be an
ordeal of peculiar anguish to him, and she half blamed herself for her
conscientiousness in wearing it. If she had conceived of any such chance
as this, she would perhaps, she thought, have worn Fanny's grenadine.

She glanced again at the group which was now receding from her. "Ah!"
the elder of the ladies said, again halting the others midway of the
piazza's length, "there's the carriage at last! But what is that stupid
animal stopping for? O, I suppose he didn't understand, and expects to
take us up at the bridge! Provoking! But it's no use; we may as well go
to him at once; it's plain he isn't coming to us. Mr. Arbuton, will you
see us on board?"

"Who--I? Yes, certainly," he answered absently, and for the second time
he cast a furtive look at Kitty, who had half started to her feet in
expectation of his coming to her before he went,--a look of appeal, or
deprecation, or reassurance, as she chose to interpret it, but after all
a look only.
