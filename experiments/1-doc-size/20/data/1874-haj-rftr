"You are too modest, Mr. Ferguson."
"No, it is quite true.  You are as rapid and accurate as I am, and
you ought to receive as high pay."
"That will come in time.  You know I make something by writing for
the papers."
"That's extra work.  How much did you make in that way last year?"
"I can tell you, because I figured it up last night.  It was one
hundred and twenty-five dollars, and I put every cent into the
savings-bank."
"That is quite an addition to your income."
"I shall make more this year.  I am to receive two dollars a column,
hereafter, for my sketches."
"I congratulate you, Harry,--the more heartily, because I think you
deserve it.  Your recent sketches show quite an improvement over
those you wrote a year ago."
"Do you really think so?" said Harry, with evident pleasure.
"I have no hesitation in saying so.  You write with greater ease than
formerly, and your style is less that of a novice."
"So I have hoped and thought; but of course I was prejudiced in my
own favor."
