STRANGE CONDUCT.
"Say, fellows, what do you think?"
"What's the matter?"
"Mallory's given in!"
"Given in! How do you mean?"
"He's going to let himself be hazed."
"What!"
Two more surprised cadets than the two who uttered this last exclamation
it would be hard to imagine. They had been sitting on a bench near
Trophy Point, and one of them had been carelessly tinkling a mandolin.
He had dropped the instrument and leaped to his feet. Now he was staring
with open mouth at the new arrival, who bore the extraordinary tidings.
"Mallory given up! Gus Murray, what on earth do you mean?"
The three were yearlings, all of them. The crowd which has usually been
designated in these stories as "Bull Harris' gang." There was Gus
Murray, the new arrival, a low, brutal-looking chap. There was the
sickly and disagreeable "Merry" Vance. And there was the little fellow
"Baby" Edwards, the meanest of them all.
"You surely can't mean," cried Vance, "that Mallory has consented to
allow the fellows to haze him?"
