my veil----" She faltered, and her clear gaze became confused. "Why
should your Indians question you?" she asked.

The last ray of the sun reddened the forest, lingered, faded, and went
out in ashes. I said:

"God and Tharon are one. Priest and Sagamore, clergyman and Sachem,
minister, ensign, Roya-neh--red men or white, all are consecrated
before the Master of Life. If in these Indians' eyes you are still to
remain sacred, then must you promise yourself to me, little Lois. And
let the Sagamore perform the rite at once."

"Betroth myself, Euan?"

"Yes, under the Rite of the Hidden Children. Will you do this--so that
my Indians can lay your hands upon their hearts? Else they may turn
from you now--perhaps prove hostile."

"I had desired to have you take me from my mother's arms."
