"Do you think that was humourous?"
"Yes; don't you? And I think what he did about you and me was really
very funny. Don't you?"
"Why is it funny for a very horrid old man to make a will full of grim
jokes and jests, and take that occasion to tell everybody exactly what
he thinks of everybody?"
"He said nothing disagreeable about us that I recollect," remarked
Gray, laughing.
Pouring sand between her fingers, she said:
"I remember very well how he mentioned us. He said that he had never
seen either one of us, and was glad of it. He said that as I was an
orphan with no money, and that as you were similarly situated, and that
as neither you nor I had brains enough to ever make any, he would leave
his coquina quarry to that one of us who had brains enough to get here
first and stake the claim. Do you call that an agreeable manner of
making a bequest?"
Gray laughed easily: "I don't care what he thought about my
intellectual capacity."
"I suppose that I don't either. And anyway the bequest may be valuable."
"There is no doubt about that," said Gray.
