to carry some books and papers over to Mrs. Camp. Don’t you think that
will be quite as acceptable, Mr. Homos?”

“I should venture to hope it,” he said, with a tolerant seriousness not
altogether out of keeping with her lightness.

“Who is Mrs. Camp?” I asked, not caring to commit myself on the question.

“Lizzie’s mother. You know I told you about them last night. I think she
must have got through the books I lent her, and I know Lizzie didn’t like
to ask me for more, because she saw me talking with you, and didn’t want
to interrupt us. Such a nice girl! I think the Sunday papers must have
come, and I’ll take them over, too; Mrs. Camp is always so glad to get
them, and she is so delightful when she gets going about public events.
But perhaps you don’t approve of Sunday papers, Mr. Homos.”

“I’m sure I don’t know, madam. I haven’t seen them yet. You know this is
the first Sunday I’ve been in America.”

“Well, I’m sorry to say you won’t see the old Puritan Sabbath,” said Mrs.
