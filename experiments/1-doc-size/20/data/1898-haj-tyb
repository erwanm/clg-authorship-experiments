mind to find the boy who had been so grossly wronged, and force the
present holder of the Ray estate to make restitution. But he was not
yet in a position to move in the matter.

Only a few hours previous he had been nearly penniless. Even now,
though he was provided with a sum of money that made him feel
comparatively rich, he knew that it would not last very long. Clearly
he must obtain employment.

He provided himself with a respectable suit of clothing, and took the
next train for New York. He had been in the metropolis two or three
times in the course of his life, but he knew no one there. He must
push his own way without help.

While other paths might be open to him, for he was a man of education
and worldly experience, he felt that he should like to get back into
his own profession. He flattered himself that if properly started he
could make himself valuable to an established attorney in the way of
hunting up cases, and taking part in any description of legal work
that might be intrusted to him.
