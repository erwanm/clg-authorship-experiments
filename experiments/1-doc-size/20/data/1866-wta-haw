" To-day noon, just after you went to the house 
for me. I came right up to see you ; but I found 
you had gone." 

" Yes ; I was so impatient to get that little 
steamer up here, that I couldn't wait any longer." 

" And what a waste your haste has made ! " laughed 
Mrs. Sherwood. " There is our fine little steamer 
at the bottom of the lake." 

" She may lie there, for all me," added Mr. Sher- 
wood, impatiently. 

"I should not dire to put my foot on board of 
her again," said Miss Fanny. 

" Nor I," chimed in Fanny Jane.
