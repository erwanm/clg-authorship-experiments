the following conversation took place.

"Mr. Armand visits Mary Jones, I am told," Adeline remarked, as an
opportunity for saying so occurred.

"He does? Well, she is a good girl--one in a thousand," replied
Uncle Joseph.

"She is only a watchmaker's daughter," said Emily, with an
ill-concealed sneer.

"And you are only a merchant's daughter. Pray, what is the
difference?"

"Why, a good deal of difference!"

"Well state it."
