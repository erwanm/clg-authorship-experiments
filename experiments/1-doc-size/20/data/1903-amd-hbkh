away ! 

When Mr. Preston came in, he kissed 
Laura and Babie Jamie, asleep on her 
shoulder. She couldn’t eat or hardly 
speak, but listened to Mrs. Brown and 
papa. They didn’t seem to think Mrs. 
Preston so very ill, but Laura really was 
afraid she would die before morning — 
and what if she never kissed her again ! 
Then she remembered how she had 
slipped away in the afternoon, and her 
heart smote her bitterly enough. 

A long while after, everything in the 

 


house was quiet— baby sleeping soundly
