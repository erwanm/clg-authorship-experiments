herself, and she prayed a long while that 
she might be kept purer in heart, and 
learn to be unselfish. 

She did not forget the next morning. 
Laura was a neat, handy little girl, and 
could do a great deal when she chose. 
She helped Ann now, and took care of 
her brother in such a pretty, winsome 
manner, that Ann quite forgot the scold- 
ing she meant to give herâ€” for the maid 
felt herself one of the family, she had 
been with them so long. 

Laura was glad at last to be able to 
go in and see her mamma. They had a 
tender talk about the incidents of the day 
before, and Mrs. Preston felt satisfied 
that they would make a lasting impres- 
sion upon her.
