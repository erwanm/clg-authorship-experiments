They were to go out to Longmeadow in wagons 
and carriages, taking refreshments and conven- 
iences. There was just a nice party. "The kind 
of people who harmonize," said Miss West. "I 
never can endure Tom, Dick and Harry every- 
body and his wife." 

" Of course you wouldn't want everybody in 
a small party," I returned. 

"I wish you were going, Rose." 

"The Sunday School picnic comes the week 
after. I could not go to both." 

" This will be ever so much nicer.' 

" O, I am not sure. There will be more en- 
joyment at that, because there will be so many 
more to enjoy everything."
