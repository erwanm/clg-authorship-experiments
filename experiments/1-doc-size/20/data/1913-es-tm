As the ingénue spoke, she entered, strolled to the mirror, considered
herself.

“We have been discussing your engagement,” Violet, in a very matter of
fact way, replied.

Aurelia adjusted her hat, patted her hair, and addressed the mirror.

“I fancied it must be something important. Did I tell you what happened
before I took Farnese?”

Violet yawned. “I have forgotten.”

Aurelia, still pluming herself, smiled.

“Then I didn’t. Besides, it is so shocking.”

Violet motioned at her. “Don’t be tiresome. I may have lost the ability
to be shocked but not the ability to be bored.”
