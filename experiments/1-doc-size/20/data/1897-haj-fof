lemonade. The rest selected stronger liquors.
"Here's to you, Dick," said Jack, tossing off the contents of his glass,
"and may you live to treat us many times more!"
"Amen to that!" said Bill.
"Haven't you got anything to say, youngster?" asked Dick, turning to
Jasper.
"I wish you a pleasant journey," said Jasper, politely.
"As to that, it depends on my success with my sister."
"When do you leave?"
"To-night, if I can."
"What's all that about, Dick? Are you going to leave us?" asked Bill.
"I'm goin' East for the benefit of my health and my purse," said Dick,
with a grin. "Do you wish me success, mates?"
"To be sure. Is it anything we can help you in?"
"No, no. It's my private venture."
"Anything in my line?"
"No; it's a strictly virtuous and honest undertaking. I don't mind
giving you a hint of it. I've got a near relative that's come into a
fortune. Now I think I ought to come in for a share."
"To be sure!"
