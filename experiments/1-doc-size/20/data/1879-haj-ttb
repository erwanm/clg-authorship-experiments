"What do you mean?" he demanded, to gain time.

"I mean that I heard your conversation with him, and I know your game.
Come back, or I will call a policeman."

The young man was sharp enough to see that he must give up his purpose.

"There, take the bundle," he said, tossing it into Frank's arms. "I was
only going for a cigar; I should have brought it back."

When John Riley came downstairs, with the letter in his hand,--for he
had been unable to find any man named Conant in the building,--he found
Frank waiting with the parcel.

"Holloa, Frank! Where's that man that sent me upstairs? I can't find Mr.
Conant."

"Of course you can't. There's no such man in the building. That man was
a thief; but for me he would have carried off your bundle."
