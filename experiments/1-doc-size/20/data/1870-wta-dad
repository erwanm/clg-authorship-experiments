protector, and I intend to stand by her to the end."

"Protector! You blockhead!" sneered he. "Pray, who made you her
protector?"

"She did, for one; and I happen to be a relative of hers, which is an
additional reason why I should not permit any one to mislead her."

"How long have you been a relative?"

"Ever since I was born, of course."

"Of course you are lying."

"I am not recognized as a relative; but no matter for that. I feel just
as much interest in her as though she was my own sister."

"I am going on board of the boat now," said Mr. Waterford, gathering
himself up.
