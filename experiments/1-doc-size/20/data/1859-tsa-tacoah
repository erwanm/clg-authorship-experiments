which the only sounds audible to the ears of each, was the beating
of their own hearts. Martin at length said--
"Have I aught to hope, Mary?"
"You know, Mr. Martin," she replied, in a voice that slightly
trembled, "that I have duties to perform beyond myself. However much
my feelings may be interested, these cannot be set aside. Under
present circumstances, my hand is not my own to give."
"But, your duties will become mine, Mary; and most gladly will I
assume them. Only give me your hand, and in return I will give you a
home for all you love, and you can do for them just as your heart
desires. Will you now be mine?"
"If my mother object not," she said, bursting into tears.
Of course, the mother had no objection to urge, and in a few weeks
they were married. It was, perhaps, three months after this event,
that the now happy family were seated in a beautifully furnished
parlor, large enough to suit even Mrs. Turner's ideas. Something had
turned their thoughts on the past, and Mary alluded to their sad
experience in keeping boarders.
"You did not lose much, did you?" asked her husband.
"We sunk over two thousand dollars," Mary replied.
