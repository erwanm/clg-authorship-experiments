hypocritical, domineering, fiery old cat. O she's fiery; you have got to 
take care how you rise up and sit down; and she's stiff, she thinks 
there's only one way and that's her way; and she's unjust, she has 
favourites--" 

"They all have favourites!" here put in another. 

"She has ridiculous favourites. And she is pious, you'll be deluged with 
the Bible and prayers; and  she's sanctimonious, you won't get leave to 
go to the opera or the theatre, or to do anything lively; and she's 
stingy, you'll learn that you must take all the potatoes you want the 
first time the dish is handed you, for it won't come a second time; and 
she's prudish, she won't let you receive visitors; and she's passionate, 
she'll fly out like a volcano if you give her a chance; and she's 
obstinate, she'll be as good--or as bad--as her word."

By this time Rotha had sprung to her feet, with ears tingling and cheeks 
burning, and stood there like Abdiel among the fallen angels, only indeed 
that is comparing great things with small She was less patient and 
prudent than Abdiel might have been.
