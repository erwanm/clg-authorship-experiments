willing to submit to any conditions which he might impose.
On emerging into the street, her companion summoned a cab. He had
reasons for not wishing to encounter any one whom he knew.
At length they reached his lodgings.
They were furnished more richly than any room Ida had yet seen; and
formed, indeed, a luxurious contrast to the dark and scantily-furnished
apartment which she had occupied for the last fortnight.
“Well, are you glad to get away from Peg?” asked John Somerville, giving
Ida a seat at the fire.
“Oh, so glad!” said Ida.
“And you wouldn’t care about going back?”
The child shuddered.
“I suppose,” said she, “that Peg will be very angry. She would beat me,
if she should get me back again.”
“But she sha’n’t. I will take good care of that.”
Ida looked her gratitude. Her heart went out to those who appeared to
deal kindly with her, and she felt very grateful to her companion for
his instrumentality in effecting her deliverance from Peg.
“Now,” said Somerville, “perhaps you will be willing to tell me what it
was you were required to do.”
