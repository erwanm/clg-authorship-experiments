Mrs. Codman .knew that Peter Manson was avari- 
cious, and to this she attributed the increase in the

object in distressing her. 

"Surely, Mr, Manson," she remonstrated, "you do' 
not think these rooms worth two dollars sc week. It is 
all we are able to do to raise the rent we now pay." 

" Humph ! " muttered Peter, avoiding the eye of his 
tenant, "they are worth all I can get for them."
