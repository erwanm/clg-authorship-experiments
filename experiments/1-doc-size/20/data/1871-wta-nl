who was directed to bring in his work to the examiner, with a card
on which his name was written attached to it. The knots and hitches
were made with a whale line on a handspike. The other questions were
answered orally, or by pointing out the part of the rigging indicated.
There were twenty questions in the list, and the promptness, as well
as the accuracy, of the answers or the work was to be considered in
marking the value of them. If a student was obliged to try two or three
times before he could make a square knot, or a clove hitch, he was
marked lower. If he did what he was required without hesitation, he had
five for each question; if not, he was marked lower, for seamen have no
time to deliberate. Though the examination was a very simple and easy
one, no student obtained above ninety, and several were below fifty.
Most of the officers had over seventy. Captain Lincoln had ninety, and
Cantwell only fifty-two, though none of them knew the results till the
first of the next month. The addition of these marks to the merit roll
for the month made some important changes in the relative standing of
the students.

"What do you say now?" inquired Scott, when he met Beckwith, after
supper.
