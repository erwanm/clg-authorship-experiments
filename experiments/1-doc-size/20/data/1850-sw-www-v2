My father makes me drink wine every now and then, — I 
don't like to do it, and he knows I do not, and 'I think that

" That is not a matter of great importance, Ellie, provided 
they do not make you do something wrong."

" You are grown, Ellie," said John, — " you are not the 
child I left you." 
" I don't know," said Ellen smiling, — " it seems to me I 
am just the same." 
" Let me see — look at me !" 
She raised her face, and amidst smiles and tears its look 
was not less clear and frank than his was penetrating. Just 
the same," was the verdict of her brother's eyes a moment 
afterwards. Ellen's smile grew bright as she read it there.
