There was a shuffling and stamping at the door. 
Mr. Gaynor beat out his old hat on the post. 
"Jerusalem! The old woman's feather bed has 
burst open this time, I guess. Why, you can't see 
your hand before you. I've been in snows before, but 
this is about the worst old tougher I ever encountered. 
Norme " he had taken up the familiar name "thank 
your stars you are this near the warehouse, if, indeed, 
you can get there at all to-morrow morning. But I 
don't suppose there'll be much trade," with a short 
chuckle. 
I knew that was an invitation to stay all night. I 
had stayed twice before in a pouring rain. 
"Oh, let's see !" Ruth sprang up. 
But as she opened the door a swirl of snow flew 
nearly across the room, and she staggered. 
It took both of us to shut the door and then we put 
up the bar. For a few moments it was a primitive 
cyclone. Ruth brushed the snow out of her hair and 
eyes and laughed. Mr. Gaynor stirred up the fire.
