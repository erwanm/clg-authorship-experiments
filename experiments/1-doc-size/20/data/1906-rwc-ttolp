"I could expect nothing; she was perfectly right to side-step a fool.
. . . And such a fool!"
The distant gallop of a horse, dulled on the soft soil, but coming
nearer, could not arouse him from the bitter depths he had sunk in; not
even when the sound ceased beside him, and horse snorted recognition to
horse. It was only when a light touch rested on his arm that he looked
up heavily, caught his breath.
"Where is the other--woman?" she gasped.
"There never was any other."
"You said--"
"I said I loved my ideal. I did not know she existed--until I saw you."
"Then--then we were searching for--"
"A vision. But it was your face that haunted me. . . . And I am not
worth it, as you say. And I know it, . . . for you have opened my eyes."
He drew bridle, forcing a laugh. "I cut a sorry figure in your life; be
patient; I am going out of it now." And he swung his horse. At the same
moment she did the same, making a demi-tour and meeting him halfway,
confronting him.
"Do you--you mean to ride out of my life without a word?" she asked
unsteadily.
