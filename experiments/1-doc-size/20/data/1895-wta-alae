"Down-stairs all together!" cried the first speaker, who was perhaps
the leader of the ruffians.
He was the first to appear at the landing. Several voices repeated the
cry to hang the colonel. At that moment a shot was heard, and the first
ruffian came tumbling down the steps. The next instant the one behind
him shared his fate, and both of them lay motionless at the foot of the
stairs.
A moment later Deck rushed in through the open door, followed by the
three riflemen.
CHAPTER XXIX
A NEW METHOD OF OPERATIONS
The fall of the two ruffians evidently created a panic among the
robbers, for they all retreated from the head of the staircase. They
could not see the person who had fired the shots. Fronklyn had used the
heavy revolver of the trooper, reserving his carbine for more difficult
practice. There was a pause, for no more victims were in sight.
"You are in a dangerous position, Lieutenant Lyon," said the sergeant,
as soon as Deck rushed into the hall.
"Where are you, Sergeant?" asked the officer, as he retired from his
exposed situation.
