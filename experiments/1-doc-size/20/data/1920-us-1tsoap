married a rich widow and she had kicked Peter out, there had come
the Temple of Jimjambo, where the “Old Man” had been Tushbar
Akrogas, the major-domo--terrible when he was thwarted, but a
generous dispenser of favors when once you had learned to flatter
him, to play upon his weaknesses, to smooth the path of his
pleasures. All these years Peter had been forced to “crook the
pregnant hinges of the knee”; it had become an instinct with him--an
instinct that went back far behind the twenty years of his conscious
life, that went back twenty thousand years, perhaps ten times twenty
thousand years, to a time when Peter had chipped flint spear-heads
at the mouth of some cave, and broiled marrow-bones for some “Old
Man” of the borde, and seen rebellious young fellows cast out to
fall prey to the sabre-tooth tiger.
