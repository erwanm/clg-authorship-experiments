"It is a pretty serious thing to connive at the escape of a criminal,"
he said.
"That remark does not affect me, sir. I know nothing of any criminal. If
I had seen him I would tell you."
Bob talked so frankly and honestly that it seemed impossible to doubt
his word. The leader of the pursuing party turned to consult with a
friend.
"The boy seems straightforward," he said. "What do you think?"
"I agree with you. Still, the man was seen to run in this direction."
The first questioner was the one most concerned in the capture of the
guilty party, for it was his store that had been robbed.
"Have you been here all the time?" he asked, turning once more to Bob.
"No, sir; my friend and I have been to the village to get supper."
"Did you leave no one on board?"
"Yes, sir; a colored boy in my service--a boy named Clip."
"Did he mention having seen any suspicious party, or any man who seemed
to be running away?"
"No, sir."
"Where is he? I would like to speak with him."
