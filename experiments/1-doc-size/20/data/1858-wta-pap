may learn to prize it as I do."
Katy seated herself on the side of the bed, for she was very anxious to
hear more about her father than she already knew. She had often asked
her mother about him, but she had generally evaded her questions, and
did not seem willing to tell her all she knew. She thought there was
some secret connected with his history, and with a child's curiosity
she was eager to have the mystery unfolded. But it was no great secret,
after all only a painful history, which her sensitive mother did not
like to rehearse. Mrs. Redburn handed the watch to Katy, and asked her
to look upon the back of it.
"Yes, mother, I have often seen those words on there--'All for the
Best.' What do they mean?" said Katy.
"This watch was given to your father by my father," replied Mrs.
Redburn, with a deep sigh, for the words seemed to recall happy
memories of the past.
"Who was your father?" asked the attentive little girl.
"His name was Matthew Guthrie. He was a merchant in Liverpool, England,
where I was born."
"A merchant, mother? Then he was a rich man, and lived in a great
house, and had plenty of servants."
