"Just so, sir; but I think such advice is better suited for Sunday,
don't you?"
"I am accustomed to drop words of counsel in season, and out of
season."
"I would rather listen to them when they are in season."
"True! I stand reproved."
The minister took from his pocket a small volume which he opened and
began to read.
"This volume," he said, "contains the sermons of the excellent Dr.
Hooker. If I had another copy I should be glad to offer it to you."
"Thank you, I don't care to read just at present."
Half an hour passed. The minister put back his book into his pocket, and
bowing politely, bade the young lady good morning.
"I am pleased to have made your acquaintance," he said.
"Thank you, sir."
Five minutes later the young lady put her hand into her pocket. She
uttered a cry of alarm.
"What is the matter, miss?" asked Mark.
"My purse is gone!" exclaimed the young lady in a state of nervous
excitement.
