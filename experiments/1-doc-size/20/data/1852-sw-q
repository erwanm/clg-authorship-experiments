evenings free, and, to tell truth, much more than their
evenings. Masters, indeed, they had; but the heads of the
house were busy with the interests of their grown-up child,
and, perhaps, with other interests, and took it for granted
that all was going right with the young ones.
"Haven't we a great deal better time than they have down
stairs, Fleda?" said Hugh, one of these evenings.
"Hum  yes"  answered Fleda, abstractedly, stroking into
order some old man in her drawing with great intentness.
"King! you rascal  keep back and be quiet, Sir!"
Nothing could be conceived more gentle and loving than Fleda's
tone of fault-finding, and her repulse only fell short of a
caress.
"What's he doing?"
"Wants to get into my lap."
"Why don't you let him?"
"Because I don't choose to  a silk cushion is good enough for
his majesty. King!" (laying her soft cheek against the little
dog's soft head, and forsaking her drawing for the purpose.)
"How you do love that dog!" said Hugh.
