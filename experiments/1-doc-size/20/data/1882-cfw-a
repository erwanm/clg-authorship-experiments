widows now; the battle-fields round Richmond were drawn with lines of
fire upon their hearts forever. Mrs. Rankin, though but just arrived,
left her household goods unpacked to decorate the chapel with wreaths of
the early green. Miss Teller and Miss Lois, both in such excitement
that they spoke incoherently, yet seemed to understand each other
nevertheless, superintended the preparations at the church-house.

As a wedding gift, Gregory Dexter sent the same package Anne had once
returned to him; the only addition was a star for the hair, set with
diamonds.

     

"I said that perhaps you would accept these some time" (he wrote). "Will
you accept them now? They were bought for you. It will give me pleasure
to think that you are wearing them. I have no right to offer you a ring;
but the diamond, in some shape, I must give you, as the one imperishable
stone. With unchanging regard,

"GREGORY DEXTER."
