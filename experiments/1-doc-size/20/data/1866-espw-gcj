A week or two after the adventures that befell that unfortunate kitten,
something happened which threatened to make the breach between Gypsy and
Joy of a very serious nature. It began, as a great many other serious
things begin, in a very small and rather funny affair.



Mrs. Surly, who has been spoken of as Gypsy's particular aversion, was a
queer old lady with green glasses, who lived opposite Mr. Breynton's,
who felt herself particularly responsible for Gypsy's training, and gave
her good advice, double measure, pressed down and running over. One
morning it chanced that Gypsy was playing "stick-knife" with Tom out in
the front yard, and that Mrs. Surly beheld her from her parlor window,
and that Mrs. Surly was shocked. She threw up her window and called in
an awful voiceâ€”

"Jemima Breynton!"
