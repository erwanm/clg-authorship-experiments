of the larger ones in our city. Another narrow 
street crossed it at the distance of only two or three 
houses from our establishment. In these streets 
were a great many small houses occupied by poor 
families. There were, as is always the case in such 
localities, a number of drinking-shops, but none at 
all respectable or attractive in appearance. 
As Lloyd and I walked away from the bindery 
that evening we noticed a bill on one of the houses 
only a little way off. It stood three or four doors 
from the corner of the two narrow streets, and en 
tirely out of sight of the main entrance to our estab 
lishment, but close to one of the rear entrances. It 
was an old two-story house, with garrets and dor 
mer windows, and had been used as a shop of some 
kind. There were two entrances, one into the shop 
and one into a narrow hall leading to the dwelling 
part of the house. 
" That 's the very place," exclaimed Lloyd as his 
eyes rested on the bill bearing the words " To Let."
