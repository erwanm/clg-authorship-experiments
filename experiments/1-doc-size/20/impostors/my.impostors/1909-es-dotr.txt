"Avenue Gabriel," he called at the chauffeur. 

"Do you remember Sarcey?" he presently resumed as the motor flew up the street. 
"On a morning a bit worse than this he had 



 

an affair which he insisted on conducting 
under an umbrella. I may be winged, the 
old idiot declared, but I refuse to catch 
cold. How did you sleep? This is Dr. 
Meyer." 

The machine now had turned into the rue 
de Rivoli. Scudding on, it crossed the fountained Place and shortly stopped in the 
briefest and most seigneurial of Parisian 
avenues.
