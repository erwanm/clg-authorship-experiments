"What makes you think so?" he asked presently.

"What are your reasons for believing it?" she asked, with a smile.

"Really," he began; then shortly, "I believe I don't like his eyes."

"Last night," said Margaret, "I was talking with him at a party. I
chanced to speak of the Doctor's coming back, and Mr. Barker laughed and
sneered, and said it was ridiculous."

The Duke moved angrily in his saddle, making the horse he rode shake his
head and plunge a little.

"He is a brute," he said at last.

"Your horse?" inquired Margaret sweetly.

"No--Barker. And pray what did you answer him? I hope you gave him a
lesson for his impertinence."
