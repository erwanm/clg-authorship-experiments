induced him to believe he was lucky.  At another time an automobile
came furiously around a corner while he was crossing the street, and
only amazing agility saved him from bodily hurt.  The car was out of
sight when he thought to recall the number.

Then came the jolt in the subway.  Only a desperate grab by one of the
guards saved him from being crushed to death.  Even then he thought
nothing.  But when a new box of cigarettes arrived and he tried one and
found it strangely perfumed, and, upon further analysis, found it to
contain a Javanese narcotic, a slow but sure death, he became wide
awake enough.  They were after him.  He began to walk carefully, to
keep in public places as often as he possibly could.

He was not really afraid of death, but he did abhor the thought of its
coming up from behind.  Except for the cigarettes they were all
"accidents;" he could not have proved anything before a jury of his
intimate friends.

He never entered an elevator without scrupulous care.  He never passed
under coverings over the sidewalks where construction was going on.
