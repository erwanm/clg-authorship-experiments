three, all he has in the world.  I want you to pay a visit right away.
Watch the butler, Jones.  He'll lie, of course; but note how he treats
the girl; and if you get the chance look around the walls for a secret
panel.  He might not have carried away the cash at all, only enough for
his immediate needs, which would account for that five thousand on the
man picked up at sea.  If I could only get inside that house for an
hour!"
"I believe I'll call at once.  Leo, was Hargreave the man's real name?"
Braine laughed.  "That is of no vital consequence.  He will be
Hargreave till the end of the chapter, dead or alive.  You can tell me
the news at dinner to-night."
So, later, when the butler accepted her card at the door, loath as he
might be, there was nothing for him to do but admit her.
"Whom do you wish to see, madam?" stepping back into the shadow.
"Miss Hargreave.  I'm an old friend of her mother's."
"There is no such person here."
"To whom, then, does this hat belong?" she asked quietly.  She waved
her hand indolently toward the hall rack.
Jones' lips tightened.  "That belongs to Miss Gray, a kind of protégée
of Mr. Hargreave's."
