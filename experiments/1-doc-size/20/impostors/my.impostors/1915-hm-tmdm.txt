And that was the inglorious end of the secret agent from Russia.




CHAPTER XIV

Perhaps the most amusing phase of the secret agent's discomfiture was
the fact that neither Jones nor Florence had the least idea what had
happened.  Florence regretted a hundred times during the evening that
she had not gone out to the summer house.  It might really have been
her father.  Her regret grew so deep in her that just before going to
bed she confessed to Jones.

"You received a letter of that sort and did not show it to me?" said
Jones, astonished.

"You warned me never to pay any attention to them."
