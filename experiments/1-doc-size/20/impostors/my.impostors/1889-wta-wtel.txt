other circumstances. But the commander was kind enough to call his
officers to him, and inform them of the duty assigned to the ship.

The government had received information which indicated the approach
to our shores of a considerable fleet of blockade runners, and the
Bellevite, on account of her reputed fast sailing, was to cruise for
a given time off the coast in search of these blockade runners.

"I have no doubt these blockade runners will go into the Bermudas,
especially the Killbright. If we go into St. George, we shall not be
allowed to sail till twenty-four hours after this fast vessel leaves,"
said Captain Breaker. "On the other hand, if we are seen off the port,
she will not come out."

"I don't see, then, that we can do anything about it, Captain Breaker,"
added Mr. Dashington.

"Captain Passford's correspondent thinks the Killbright is intended for
the Confederate Navy, and that she is commanded by a naval officer sent
out for the purpose," continued the captain.
