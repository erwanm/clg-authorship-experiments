however, had been accomplished .with a good 
deal of bitterness, for he was very ambitious and 
very proud, and to be obliged to digest the fact 
that he was but a type of the great majority was 
distinctly galling. True, politics were left. His 
father, one of the most distinguished of 
England's statesmen, and a member of the present 
cabinet, would have been delighted to assist his 
career; but Harold disliked politics. With the 
exception of his passing interest in the Russian 
socialists — an interest springing from his 
adventurous nature — he had never troubled himself 
about any party, faction, or policy, home or 
foreign. He would like to write a great poem, but 
he had never felt a second's inspiration, and had 
never wasted time in the endeavor to force it. 
Failing that, he would like to write a novel; 
but, fluently and even brilliantly as he 
sometimes talked, his pen was not ready, and he was 
conscious of a conspicuous lack of imagination.
