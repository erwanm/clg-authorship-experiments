of his audience, Bayard deliberately left the desk, and, passing

upon the beach. Her heavy eyes traced the little pebbles in the
sand. For her life, she thought, she could not have lifted her
smarting lids. Till that moment, perhaps, Lena had never known what
shame meant. It overwhelmed her, like the deluge which one dreams
may foretell the end of the world.
