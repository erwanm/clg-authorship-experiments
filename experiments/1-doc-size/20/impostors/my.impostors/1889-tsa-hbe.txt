scorn, or malicious pleasure; still less did they attempt to annoy us
with either mockery or outrage. After we had passed through the town
gates, and a long and very narrow street, we turned into a by-lane,
and saw on a high piece of ground before us, which was surrounded by
an earthen wall and thick-set hedge, and guarded by armed soldiers, a
building which was, perhaps, to be our prison during life.
As soon as we entered we were mustered by an officer, according to the
instructions given him by the captain of our guards, and then led
farther into the court, where we saw a large, dark shed, in which
stood cages made of strong bars of wood, and resembling bird-cages in
every thing but size. After the Japanese had taken counsel among
themselves for some time, as to how they should dispose of us, they
led me along a passage, and forced me to go into one of the little
apartments, which was partitioned off by means of wooden posts. I
looked around for my companions, and judge of my horror, when I found
that they had vanished. After the guards had taken off my bonds, and
also, taken off my boots, they fastened the door of my cage, without
saying a word, and left me to myself. The thought that I was separated
from my comrades, overcame me, and I threw myself on the ground in
despair.
