“St. Roch, pray for us.”

There is testimony that many people, even Protestants, and men, have had
wounds cured and been healed of diseases by prayer in this chapel. To
this distant shrine come ladies from all parts of the city to make
the “novena”—the prayer of nine days, with the offer of the burning
taper—and here daily resort hundreds to intercede for themselves or
their friends. It is believed by the damsels of this district that if
they offer prayer daily in this chapel they will have a husband within
the year, and one may see kneeling here every evening these trustful
devotees to the welfare of the human race. I asked the colored woman who
sold medals and leaflets and renewed the candles if she personally knew
any persons who had been miraculously cured by prayer, or novena, in St.
Roch. “Plenty, sir, plenty.” And she related many instances, which were
confirmed by votive offerings on the walls. “Why,” said she, “there was
a friend of mine who wanted a place, and could hear of none, who made a
novena here, and right away got a place, a good place, and” (conscious
that she was making an astonishing statement about a New Orleans
servant) “she kept it a whole year!”
