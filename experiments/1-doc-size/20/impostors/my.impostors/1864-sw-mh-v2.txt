"Well Daisy," said Mr. Randolph that evening, "how do you like your new
play that you are all so busy about?"

"I like it pretty well, papa."

"Only pretty well! Is that the most you can say of it? I understood that
it was supposed to be an amusement of a much more positive character."

"Papa, it is amusing--but it has its disagreeablenesses."

"Has it? What can they be? Or has everything pleasant its dark side?"

"I don't know, papa."

"What makes the shadows in this instance?"

It seemed not just easy for Daisy to tell, for her father saw that she
looked puzzled how to answer.

"Papa, I think it is because people do not behave perfectly well."
