"How long before my father will receive the money?" asked Tom.

"The steamer starts in three days. About a month will be needed."

Then Tom moved aside, and the next man took his place.

"I am glad that is attended to," said Tom, relieved. "Now, Mr. Ferguson,
I will go wherever you wish."

"We had better secure a lodging," said the Scotchman. "When we are sure
of a bed we can walk about at our leisure."

Lodgings were to be had, but they were generally very dear. The first
room looked at was five dollars per day, without board,--a price our
friends were unwilling to pay. Finally they found a decent, though small
room, with rather a narrow bed, which could be had for three fifths of
that sum, and they engaged it.

"We will have to go back to the mines soon," said Tom. "San Francisco is
too expensive for us to live in."
