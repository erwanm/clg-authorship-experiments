looked sleepy, stupid, and ashamed of himself, and Mrs. Fishley thought
he must have taken cold. According to his custom, the senator said grace
at the table, by invitation of his brother, who, however, never returned
thanks himself.

I could not help keeping one eye fixed on the distinguished man, for so
unusual an event as saying grace in that house did not fail to make an
impression upon me. I noticed that he cast frequent glances at me, and
very uneasy ones at that. Doubtless he felt that I could unfold a tale
which was not exactly consistent with his religious pretensions. But, in
spite of all I knew, I did not regard him as a hypocrite. I did not know
enough about him to enable me to reach so severe a judgment. The shame
and penitence he had manifested assured me he was not in the habit of
getting intoxicated; and I was willing to believe that he had been led
away by the force of circumstances a single time, and that the error
would cure itself by its own reaction.

"It's rather chilly this morning," said Captain Fishley. "Buck, you may
make a little fire in the stove."
