until one naorning Mrs. Howard finds her in a high fever, 
and the doctor is summoned at once. Still, she does not 
appear seriously ill, though it is the dread scourge that 
cuts off so many lives. For a few days she wavers, 
then drops down, and all skill is unavailing. Her husband 
is hastily recalled, but she lies then in a half -unconscious 
state, and with no word, no sign of tenderness, she drops 
out of the life that began so fair, but which she marred 
by her own hand. Basil's unknown sin toward her has 
been amply atoned, but it will be his lifelong regret that 
in those weeks of brooding, implacable passion, he has 
stained his manhood with it. 

The Stirlings linger longer abroad than they at first 
intended, and Agatha's little daughter is born at Rome. 
Olive, too, rejoices in motherhood, and Louise is making 
sure there will be children enough to share all the fortunes
