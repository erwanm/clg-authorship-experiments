storing up your honey."

The sale took place the next morning at ten, at the Court House. There
was quite a number of spectators, though the ladies, with Maverick and
Darcy, were in a private office. Hamilton Minor had come up, resolved
that it should not go for less than the mortgage, but desirous of ending
his responsibility. There were but two bids. The auctioneer lingered a
long while on Mr. Hildreth's bid, commenting on the enormous sacrifice,
but he could move no one's interest. It was reluctantly knocked down,
the purchase-money paid, and the deed made out to Miss McLeod.

Then the company's agreement was put in lawful, legal shape. The
managing board of five men were to have sole charge of buying, selling,
and manufacturing. They were to give all their time and ability, to
watch the state of the market, and conduct every thing for the benefit
of the whole corporation. Darcy was to prepare a balance-sheet
semi-annually, showing profit and loss; and this was to be open to the
inspection of the firm.
