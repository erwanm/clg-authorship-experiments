the use of mine." And she pointed to a rustic ladder lying half-buried
in the weedy tangle behind him.

He gave himself a moment to steady his voice: "I supposed there was a
ladder here--somewhere," he said, quietly.

"Oh! And why did you suppose--" She spoke too hurriedly, and she began
again, pleasantly indifferent: "The foresters use a ladder for pruning,
not for climbing walls."

He strolled over to the thicket, lifted the light ladder, and set it
against the wall. When he had done this he stepped back, examining the
effect attentively; then, as though not satisfied, shifted it a trifle,
surveyed the result, moved it again, dissatisfied.

"Let me see," he mused aloud, "I want to place it exactly where it was
that night--" He looked back at her interrogatively. "Was it about where
I have placed it?"

Her face was inscrutable.
