"I don't care if I wasn't; I'm going down."
"So you said before;" and the boatswain tried to pacify the youngster,
and to induce him to be reasonable; but Clyde had always had his own
way, and was ready to fight for it now, even though he had nothing to
gain by it.
Captain Cumberland was still walking with Miss Celia, explaining to
her the nature of the discipline on board, and giving her an account
of the voyage across the Atlantic. A group of the officers had
collected on the quarter-deck, and, much amused at the scene, were
observing the conduct of Clyde. As he became more violent, his sister
tried to quiet him, and induce him to behave like a gentleman; but he
replied to her in a tone and with words which made the captain's
cheeks tinge with indignation.
Finally, when he found that abuse had no effect upon the stout
boatswain, he drew back, and made a desperate plunge at his heavy
opponent. Peaks caught him by the shoulders, and lifted him off his
feet like a baby. Taking him in his arms, with one hand over his
mouth, to smother his cries, he bore him to the waist, where his yells
could not be heard by his mother.
