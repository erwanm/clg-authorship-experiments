am glad to find you have the manliness to ac- 
knowledge your guilt. Paul, your hand ; I have 
been grieving over you all day, and now I am 
rejoiced to find you are still true to yourself and 
the good character you have hitherto borne." 

Paul gave the captain his hand, and thanked 
him for the kind words he had spoken. 

"What was the quarrel I witnessed just before 
I came on board ? " asked Captain Littleton. 

'' Frank Thompson wanted to run away from 
you, and have the cruise out," replied Paul. 
" Tom and all the rest of the party opposed him, 
and finally took the helm away from him by 
force." .
