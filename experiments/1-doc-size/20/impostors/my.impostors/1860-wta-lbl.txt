" Yes ; you are wanted at home." 
Our hero was filled with terror and anxiety by 
this reply. He was sure that something had hap- 
pened, or a gentleman like Captain Littleton would 
not have taken the trouble to come after him. 
As the boat struck the bank, he brailed up the sail, 
and jumped ashore with the painter in his hand. 
" Come, Paul, never mind the boat ; Thomas 
will take care of her. Get into the chaise with 
me as quick as you can," said Captain Littleton. 
" What is the matter, sir ? What has hap- 
pened ? " demanded Paul, trembling with the most 
painful solicitude. 
" Get into the chaise first, and I will tell you 
as we return." 
" Has any thing happened to my mother, sir ? " 
cried Paul, the tears rushing to his eyes. 
" Nothing has happened to your mother, Paul. 
She is quite well," answered Captain Littleton, as 
he urged the horse to his utmost speed.
