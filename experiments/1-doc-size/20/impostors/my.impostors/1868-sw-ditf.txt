"But there is a great deal in you, - for somebody."

"For you, papa."

"Nobody else, Daisy?"

He was holding me close in his arms and looking down into my
face. I believe the colour must have come into my cheeks.

"Ah, I thought so!" he said. "Even so soon, Daisy, you are
leaving me for somebody else."

"Papa!" I exclaimed, hiding my face in his neck, - "I will
never leave you, till you say so."

"Till I say so? I will not be over selfish, my dear child. I
do not mean that."

"Who is it to be, Daisy?" my mother's voice said behind us.
