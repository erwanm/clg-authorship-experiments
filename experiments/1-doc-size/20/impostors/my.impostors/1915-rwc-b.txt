and hold the craters. . . . Five minutes! . . . 
When the mines explode that is your signal. 
Bombers lead. Give them a leg up and follow. . . . Three minutes. . . ." 

From a communication trench a long file of 
masked bomb-throwers appeared, loaded sacks 
slung under their left arms, bombs clutched 
in their right hands; and took stations at 
every ladder and row of freshly driven pegs. 

"One minute!" repeated the officers, selecting their own ladders and drawing their long 
knives and automatics. 

As I finished adjusting my respirator and 
goggles a muffled voice at my elbow began: 
"Be a sport, Doc! Gimme a chanst! Make 
it fifty-fifty " 

"Allez!" shouted an officer through his respirator.
