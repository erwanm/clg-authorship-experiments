"Why, I thought religion made people good and pleasant----" Then she
checked herself, for often Cousin Elizabeth was not pleasant. And she
seemed more religious than Cousin Eunice. And Cousin Chilian rarely
scolded or said a cross word--he never talked about religion, but he
went to church on Sunday; they all did. She studied the Catechism, she
could learn easily when she had a mind to, but she didn't understand it
at all. She shocked Elizabeth by her irreverent questions. There was the
old horn-book primer with--

          "In Adam's fall
           We sinned all."

"I don't see how that could be when we were not there!" she said almost
defiantly.

"It means the nature we inherited."

"But I don't think that fair!"
