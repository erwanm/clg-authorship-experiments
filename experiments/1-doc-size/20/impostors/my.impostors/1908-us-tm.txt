went down town that morning with every fibre of him, body and mind,
alert and eager; and he went into his office, and in his mail was a
letter from Mr. Hasbrook. He opened it hastily and read a message,
brief and direct and decisive as a sword-thrust:

"I beg to inform you that I have received a satisfactory proposition
from the Fidelity Company. I have settled with them, and wish to
withdraw the suit. Thanking you for your services, I remain, sincerely."

To Montague the thing came like a thunderbolt. He sat utterly
dumbfounded--his hands went limp, and the letter fell upon the desk in
front of him.

And at last, when he did move, he picked up the telephone, and told his
secretary to call up Mr. Hasbrook. Then he sat waiting; and when the
bell rang, picked up the receiver, expecting to hear Mr. Hasbrook's
voice, and to demand an explanation. But he heard, instead, the voice
of his own secretary: "Central says the number's been discontinued,
sir."
