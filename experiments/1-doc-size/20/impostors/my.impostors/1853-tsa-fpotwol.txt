"And pray what are you doing up at this time of night, ha?" said he,
in drunken anger.
"You did not like it, you know, because I was in bed last night, and
so I have sat up for you this time," his wife replied, soothingly.
"Well, you've no business to be up this late, let me tell you,
madam. And I'm not agoing to have it. So bundle off to bed with you,
in less than no time!"
"O Henry! how can you talk so to me?" poor Mary said, bursting into
tears.
"You needn't go to blubbering in that way, I can tell you, madam; so
just shut up! I won't have it! And see here: I must have three
hundred dollars out of that stingy old father of yours to-morrow,
and you must get it for me. If you don't, why, just look out for
squalls."
As he said this, he threw himself heavily upon the bed, and came
with his whole weight upon the body of his child. Mrs. Fenwick
screamed out, sprang to the bedside, and endeavoured to drag him off
the little girl. Not understanding what she meant, he rose up
quickly, and threw her from him with such force, as to dash her
against the wall opposite, when she fell senseless upon the floor.
