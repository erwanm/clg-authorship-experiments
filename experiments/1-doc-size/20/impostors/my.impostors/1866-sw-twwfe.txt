different but that a good deal of likeness often remained. 
However, the people were no longer 'of one lip,' as the 
Hebrew baa it, even if they used the same words. They 





spoke them variously; and so it followed that they did just 
what the Lord meant them to do ; they went off by families 
to settle the earth. And in this division the sons of Japheth 
took the ' isles of the Gentiles;' which means, the islands 
and coasts of the Mediterranean and its sister waters." 

"That wasn't much for Japheth to have," said Priscilla. 

" Wasn't it? Let us see. Japheth, you know, means 
' extension.' His first son mentioned is Gomer. Now you 
want the map."
