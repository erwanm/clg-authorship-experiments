man who possesses the instincts and intellect of a coach- 
man? She is asked everywhere, she has her own money.

" You mean let her make a fool of herself with 
Stephen Siward? That is where she is drifting." 
" Do you think " 
" Yes, I do. She has a perfect genius for selecting 
the wrong man ; and she's already sorry for this one. 
I'm sorry for Stephen, too; but it's safe for me to be," 
" She might make something of him." 
" You know perfectly well no woman ever did 
make anything of a doomed man. He'd kill her — I 
mean it, Kemp ! He would literally kill her with grief. 
She isn't like Leila Mortimer; she isn't like most girls 
of her sort. You men think her a rather stunning, 
highly tempered, unreasonable young girl, with a re- 
serve of sufficiently trained intelligence to marry the 
best our market offers — and close her eyes ; — a thor- 
oughbred with the caprices of one, but also with the 
grafted instinct for proper mating."
