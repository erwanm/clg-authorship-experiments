“Dislike her?  No, I don’t dislike her; but she is disappointing.  If she
were a plain girl her plain-mindedness would be all right; it would be
amusing; she would turn it to account and make it seem humorous.  But it
doesn’t seem to go with her beauty; it takes away from that—I don’t know
how to express it exactly.”

“You mean that she has no charm.”

“No; I don’t mean that at all.  She has a great deal of charm of a
certain kind, but it’s a very peculiar kind.  After all, the truth is the
truth, Basil, isn’t it?”

“It is sometimes, my dear,” I assented.

“And the truth has its charm, even when it’s too blunt.”

“Ah, I’m not so sure of that.”

“Yes—yes, it has.  You mustn’t say so, Basil, or I shall lose all my
faith in you.  If I couldn’t trust you, I don’t know what I should do.”
