fly very well, and somehow it was thought to look babyish; but it was

boys played with, and which was made by fastening two sticks in the form
of a cross. Any fellow more than six years old who appeared on the

was cut an inch or two larger, and then pasted and folded over the
string. Most of the boys used a paste made of flour and cold water; but
