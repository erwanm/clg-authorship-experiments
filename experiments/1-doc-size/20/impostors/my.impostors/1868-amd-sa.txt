truth boldly in the face. I had loved Mr. St. John I did 
love him now. The peculiar influence he had exerted 
over me would always keep me from yielding to any other. 
Whether we were really antagonistic, or if it had been 
the result of some special fault in either, I was unable to 
determine ; but I recognized the fact. That hope, there- 
fore, had dropped out of my life. 

My future was all my own : to spend it in slow years of 



 

stagnation was simply impossible. What must I do? I 
could not go out into the world and make another fortune 
in the place of 'the one I had lost. I could not raise my- 
self to any height: a simple, aimless existence, earning my 
daily bread and raiment.
