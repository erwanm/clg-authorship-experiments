CHAPTER XL 

NORTON made his way to the brown 
door of the parsonage, and knocked 
but the person that opened it was the minister himself. Norton was a little confused 
now, remembering what his errand meant 
there. 

"Norton Laval, isn't it?" said Mr. Rich 
mond. " You are very welcome, Norton, at 
my house. Will you come in ? " 

" No, sir. If you please " 

"What is it? Something you would 
rather say to me here ? "
