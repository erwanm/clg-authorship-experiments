How they had originally entered the place was a 
mystery. Possibly they had been lowered from above, 
down the well-shaft, but it was all very hard to explain. 
The only thing that seemed certain was that the treas- 
ure had never been seen by any one since it had been 
closed in under the vault, ages ago. Malipieri had not 
yet found time to make a careful plan of all the places 
through which he had passed. There were so many 
turns and changes of level, that it would be impossible 
to get an accurate drawing without using a theodolite 
or some similar instrument of precision. From the 
measurements he had taken, however, and the rough 
sketches he had made, he believed that the double vault 
was not under the palace itself, but under the open 
courtyard, at the depth of about forty feet, and there- 
fore below the level of the Tiber at average high water.
