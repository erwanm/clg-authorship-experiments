stimulated him in his efforts to amuse Miss Brandon.

Sybil, too, in her quiet way, was very willing to be amused, and she found
in Ronald Surbiton an absolute freshness of ideas that gave her a new
sense of pleasure. Her affair with Vancouver had made a deep impression on
her mind, and her mother's death soon afterwards had had the effect of
withdrawing her entirely from the world. It was no wonder, therefore, that
she liked this young Englishman, so different from most of the men she
knew best. It was natural, too, that he should want to talk to her, for
she was the only young girl present. At last, as Ronald began to feel that
intimacy which sometimes grows out of a simple conversation between two
sympathetic people, he turned to the subject he had most in mind, if not
most in his heart.

"You and my cousin are very intimate, Miss Brandon, I believe?" he said.

"Yes--I have grown very fond of her in a few weeks." Sybil wondered
whether Ronald was going to make confidences. It seemed to her rather
early in the acquaintance.
