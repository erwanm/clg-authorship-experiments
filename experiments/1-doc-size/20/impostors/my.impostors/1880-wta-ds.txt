time but did not hear it again, and I concluded that a young alligator,
or some other water animal, had crawled into the opening.

I started to return to the stairs which led from the main deck forward
to the space in front of the saloon. I was passing between two piles of
lightwood on my way, when I heard the report of a pistol. A bullet
whistled uncomfortably near my head. I don't claim to be bullet-proof,
and I was startled by the sound, and by the whizzing of the ball so
near my head. I made up my mind on the instant that the shot was
intended for me, and that my life was in actual danger. Buck and Hop
were attending to the mules on shore, and I saw no one on the lower
deck.

Moses Brickland and Ben Bowman were in their rooms, and I called them.
I told them what had happened. They had heard the shot; but some one
was shooting about all the time in the vicinity of the boat, and they
paid no attention to such sounds. We searched every part of the lower
deck, even opening the trap into the paddle-box, made to allow a
workman to get in when repairs were necessary. We could find no person.
