milk, or cream; 5 eggs, beaten light; 2 tablespoonfuls sugar; 2
tablespoonfuls prepared flour; juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated

Work the cream into the potato; add beaten yolks and sugar, and whip to
a froth. Put in lemon, flour, nutmeg, and beat three minutes before
stirring in the whites. Drop, by the spoonful, into hot sweet lard, and
fry to a light brown. Drain upon clean, heated paper, sift white sugar
thickly over them and serve at once. Eat if you like with wine sauce,
or with powdered sugar only.
