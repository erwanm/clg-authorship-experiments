Anxious and impatient for the time when all suspense 
would be removed, Adam passed the next few days in a 
state of restless uncertainty. Mr. Larobe returned, in 
due course, with the body, preserved in ice ; but the 
face was so blackened and disfigured that not a feature 
was recognizable. By previous arrangement, the fune 
ral took place on the day following. Of the severed and 
alienated house-hold, all were present but John, who was 
still at sea. Lydia was scarcely recognized by Adam or 
her step-mother. No one spoke to, or noticed her hus 
band, after the first cold introduction. Although Lydia 
arrived on the day previous to that designated for the 



 

funeral, she was not invited to remain, and after sitting 
for an hour or two in the heart-chilling atmosphere of 
her old home, retired with her husband.
