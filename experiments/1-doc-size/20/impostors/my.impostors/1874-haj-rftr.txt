Fitz appeared upon the scene early.  In fact one of the boys called
for him, and induced him to come round to school earlier than usual.
Significant glances were exchanged when he made his appearance, but
Fitz suspected nothing, and was quite unaware that he was attracting
more attention than usual.

Punctually at half-past eight, Abner Bickford with his tin-cart
appeared in the street, and with a twitch of the rein began to ascend
the Academy Hill.

"Look there," said Tom Carver, "the tin-pedler's coming up the hill.
Wonder if he expects to sell any of his wares to us boys.  Do you
know him, Fitz?"

"I!" answered Fitzgerald with a scornful look, "what should I know of
a tin-pedler?"

Tom's mouth twitched, and his eyes danced with the anticipation of
fun.
