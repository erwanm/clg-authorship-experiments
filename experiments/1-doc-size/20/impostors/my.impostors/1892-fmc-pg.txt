But say nothing at present. You should get a nurse at once, for some one
must sit up with him all night. I will send him something to take
immediately, and I will come back myself in about two hours."

They went away together, but when the doctor returned, he found Ghisleri
waiting for him in the street. It was now five o'clock and quite dark.
Pietro remained down stairs while the visit lasted.

"Well?" he asked, when the physician came down again.

"It is scarlet fever, as I was afraid--one of the most sudden cases I
ever knew. They have not got a nurse yet, the idea seems to frighten
Lady Herbert."

"I will see to it," said Ghisleri. "By the bye, it is contagious, is it
not? I have a visit to pay before dinner; ought I to change my
clothes?"
