"Father!" exclaimed the fond girl, as she bent over him and kissed his
pale face, now slightly flushed with fever.

"I have been very ill," he added.

"You have, indeed; but you are better now; and I am so glad, mon
père!"

"Ah, ma fille, you are a good girl! You have been by my side all
night. It was selfish for me to wake you."

"No, no! It was not. I'm glad you did. I am so happy to find you
better!"

"What ails me? I can't move my right arm, nor my right leg," asked
André, struggling to raise his limbs. "There is no feeling in my right
side."

"The doctor will come by and by, and tell you all about it."
