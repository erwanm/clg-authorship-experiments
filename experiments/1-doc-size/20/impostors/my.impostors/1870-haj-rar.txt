Rufus looked bewildered.

"Can't I get a chance there too?" he asked. "I'd be willin' to give 'em
the pleasure of my society for half a price, say a dollar a week,
besides a room."

"We are to be boarded also," said Miss Manning, in a tone of
satisfaction.

"If it's a conundrum I'll give it up," said Rufus; "just tell a feller
all about it, for I begin to think you're crazy, or else have come
across some benevolent chap that's rather loose in the upper story."

Hereupon Miss Manning, unwilling to keep Rufus longer in suspense, gave
him a full account of her morning's adventures, including her engagement
with Mrs. Colman.

"You're in luck," said Rufus, "and I'm glad of it; but there's one thing
we'll have to settle about."
