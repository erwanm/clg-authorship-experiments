John's note," he said. "Perhaps I may be more successful than he."

"If you don't mind, Mr. Packard," said Rupert, "I will go on at once to
New York, as I feel anxious about my mother."

"Very well. Go to the Somerset Hotel, and put up as a guest. I shall
follow you soon."

Leaving Rupert to pursue his journey, we will detail the experiences of
Giles and his uncle at Rochester.

"We will put up at a cheap hotel, Uncle John," he said. "I don't want
Eben to suspect that I am well off."

"He wouldn't judge so from your dress, Giles," remarked the old man,
with a humorous glance at his nephew's well-worn suit.

"That is true, Uncle John. I don't look very much like a dude, I admit.
However, I will go to a first-class tailor in New York and get myself
rigged out. While I am about it I will get a new suit for you."
