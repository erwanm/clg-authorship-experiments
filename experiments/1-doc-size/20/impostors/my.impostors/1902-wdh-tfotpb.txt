He made Pony come in every night before nine o'clock, and even Christmas
Eve, or the night before Fourth of July, he would not let him stay up the
whole night. When he went to the city, as the boys called the large town
twenty miles away from the Boy's Town, he might get Pony a present or he
might not, but he would not promise, because once when he promised, he
forgot it, and then Pony's mother scolded him.

There were some boys' fathers in the Boy's Town who were good fathers, and
let their children do whatever they pleased, and Pony could not help
feeling rather ashamed before these boys. If one of that sort of fellows'
fathers passed a crowd of boys, they would not take any notice of their
boys; but if Pony's father came along, he would very likely say, "Well,
Pony!" or something like that, and then all the fellows would hollo,
"Well, Pony! Well, Pony!" and make fun of his father, when he got past,
and walk like him, or something, so that Pony would be so mad he would
hardly know what to do. He hated to ask his father not to speak to him, or
look at him, when he was with the fellows, but it seemed to him as if his
father ought to know better without asking.
