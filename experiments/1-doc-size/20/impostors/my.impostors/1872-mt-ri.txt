burned their flesh, got drunk, bunied each other's huts, maimed 
or murdered one another according to the caprice of the mo- 
ment, and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbri- 
dled licentiousness. And after it all, came a torpor from which 
the nation slowly emerged bewildered and dazed, as if from a 
hideous half-remembered nightmare. They were not the salt 
of the earth, those " gentle children of the sun." 

The natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which can- 
not be comforting to an invalid. "When they think a sick 
friend is going to die, a couple of dozen neighbors surround 
his hut and keep up a deafening wailing night and day till he 
either dies or gets well. No doubt this arrangement has helped 
many a subject to a shroud before his appointed time. 

They surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken 
way when its occupant returns from a journey. This is their 
dismal idea of a welcome. A very little of it would go a great 
way Math most of us.
