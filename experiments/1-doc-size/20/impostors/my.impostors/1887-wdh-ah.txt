“I’m afraid you’re too amiable altogether, Mr. Mavering. I’m sure you
let people impose upon you,” said the other lady. “You have been letting
us impose upon you.”
“Ah! now that proves you’re all wrong, Mrs. Pasmer.”
“It proves that you know how to say things very prettily.”
“Oh, thank you. I know when I’m having a good time, and I do my best to
enjoy it.” He ended with the nervous laugh which seemed habitual with
him.
“He, does laugh a good deal;” thought Mrs. Pasmer, surveying him with
smiling steadiness. “I suppose it tires Alice. Some of his teeth are
filled at the sides. That vein in his forehead--they say that means
genius.” She said to him: “I hope you know when others are having a good
time too, Mr. Mavering? You ought to have that reward.”
They both looked at Alice. “Oh, I should be so happy to think you hadn’t
been bored with it all, Mrs. Pasmer,” he returned;--with-deep feeling.
Alice was looking at one of the sketches which were pretty plentifully
pinned about the wall, and apparently seeing it and apparently listening
to what Professor Saintsbury was saying; but her mother believed from a
tremor of the ribbons on her hat that she was conscious of nothing but
young Mavering’s gaze and the sound of his voice.
