subjection in her little world had armed her, Mrs. Mavering probably did
not feel the girl’s shrinking, or, if she did, took it for the natural
embarrassment which she would feel. She had satisfied herself that she
was looking her best, and that her cap and the lace jacket she wore were
very becoming, and softened her worst points; the hangings of her
bed and the richly embroidered crimson silk coverlet were part of
the coquetry of her costume, from which habit had taken all sense of
ghastliness; she was proud of them, and she was not aware of the scent

set look broke into a smile, and she put out her hand, neither hot nor
cold, but of a dry neutral, spiritual temperature, and pulled Alice down
and kissed her.

“Why, child, your hand’s like ice!” she exclaimed without preamble. “We
used to say that came from a warm heart.”
