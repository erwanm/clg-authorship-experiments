thoughtfully. "I would like to tell her that I didn't mean it--case of
boy and grasshopper, you know.... Well, as you say, gun-play has no
place in real novels. There wouldn't be room, anyway, with all the
literature and illustrations and purpose and purple preciousness; as
anachronismatically superfluous as sleigh-bells in hell."

Portlaw resumed his egg; Malcourt considered him ironically.

"Sporty Porty, are you going to wed the Pretty Lady of Pride's Hall at
Pride's Fall some blooming day in June?"

"None of your infernal business!"

"Quite so. I only wanted to see how the novel was coming out before
somebody takes the book away from me."

"You talk like a pint of shoe-strings," growled Portlaw; "you'd better
find out whose horse has been denting the lawn all over and tearing off
several yards of sod."
