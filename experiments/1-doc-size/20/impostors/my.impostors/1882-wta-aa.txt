the information given by the skipper.

"I think not at present," replied Dory. "But you have been through this
once before to-day."

"It wasn't half so bad as it is now," protested Corny. "It didn't begin
to blow very hard until we got to Valcour's Island."

"Did the Missisquoi make better weather of it than the Goldwing?" asked
Dory.

"The lake didn't begin to be as rough as it was a little while ago,"
replied Corny. "The steamer pitched tremendously, and we all had to pump
after we got beyond Valcour's."

"Do you see any thing of the Missisquoi?" asked Dory, who had been too
busy to give any attention to the steamer.

"I can just see her at the south of the island. She has not got off
yet," replied Corny.
