  accumulate at its source?' was the next interrogation; which
  elicited the contemptuous reply: 'There is as much ice and snow at
  the south pole as at the north, ignorant Clarkey.' 'But it flows
  from the Gulf of Mexico?' pursued the undismayed. 'You've got me
  there, unless it flows underground,' was the cool and unexpected
  retort; and it wound up by declaring, sensibly, that, after all,
  'it is a meeting of the north and south Atlantic currents, which
  collide, and the eddie (sic) runs northward.' [At another time,]
  on being twice interrogated in regard to a subject, it replied
  tartly: 'I hate to be asked if I am sure of a fact.'"

Now, what could have been this intelligence which thus insisted upon
preserving and asserting its individuality so distinctly as to forbid
all reasonable hypothesis of a compounded derivation from the minds of
the circle, even were such a thing possible? A fairy, perhaps, snugly
cuddled up under the board so as to elude observation. Friend "Clarkey,"
try again, for surely this time you are a little befogged, or else the
present writer is more so.
