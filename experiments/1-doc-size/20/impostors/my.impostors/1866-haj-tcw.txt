point.”

“No great loss,” said Jack. “You wouldn’t care much about seeing her
again. She is a tall, gaunt, disagreeable looking woman; while Ida is
fair, and sweet looking. I didn’t fancy this Mrs. Hardwick when I first
set eyes on her. Aunt Rachel was right, for once.”

“What did she think?”

“She took a dislike to her, and declared that it was only a plot to get
possession of Ida; but then, that was what we expected of Aunt Rachel.”

“Still, it seems difficult to imagine any satisfactory motive on the
part of this woman, supposing she is not Ida’s mother.”

“Mother, or not,” returned Jack, “she’s got possession of Ida; and,
from all that you say, she is not the best person to bring her up. I am
determined to rescue Ida from this she-dragon. Will you help me, uncle?”
