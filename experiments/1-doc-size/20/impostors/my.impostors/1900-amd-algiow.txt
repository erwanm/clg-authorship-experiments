frocks, and they laugh and talk. I can hear you upstairs when I am in
my bed. And the fiddles sound so gay, and then I know you are dancing.

"The birthdays might do for little people who are anxious to grow old
fast," said Jaqueline, patting the child's shoulder. "But the rest
of us wouldn't want two or three in a year. And it won't be very long
before you'll be going to Washington to see the queen, pussy cat."

"But I want you, not the queen. It will be so lonesome when you are

"You are a little sweet!" Jaqueline bent over and kissed her. "I hope
you'll stay just sweet, nothing else. Everybody will love you."
