My situation was peculiar, and, among my daily associates, unique.
Loving the Union with a passion of patriotism inconceivable by those
who have never had what they call by that name put to such test of
rack and flame as the martyrs of old endured, I yet had no personal
interest in one soldier who fought for the Cause as dear to me as life
itself. My prayers and hopes went out to the Federal army as a glorious
engine, consecrated to a sublime and holy purpose—even the salvation
of the nation by the preservation of the Union. And all the while, my
best-beloved brother was in the fiercest of the fight down there, in
the State dearer to me than any other could ever be. Cousins by the
score, and friends and valued acquaintances by the hundred, were with
Lee and Jackson, Early, Stuart, and Hill, exposed to shot and shell and
sword. My brother Herbert had gone home in ’61, after he was graduated
from the Theological Seminary in New Brunswick, and received a license
to preach.
Shortly after his installation in a country parish, he had married
a girl he had fallen in love with while studying with my husband
in Charlotte. Although a non-combatant, he might be forced by
circumstances to take up arms, as many of the profession were doing.
His home was raided more than once by predatory bands of stragglers
