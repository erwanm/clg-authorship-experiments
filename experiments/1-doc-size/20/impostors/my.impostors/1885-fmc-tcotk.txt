are doing, and I am not afraid to tell you so. And take back your gold,
for I do not want it, and it is not clean! And so good-day, Signor
Conte, and many thanks. When you asked me to come here, I thought you
had some private message for the Signorina."

During Teresina's speech San Miniato had not betrayed the slightest
surprise or disappointment. He quietly lighted a cigarette and smiled
good-humouredly all the time.
