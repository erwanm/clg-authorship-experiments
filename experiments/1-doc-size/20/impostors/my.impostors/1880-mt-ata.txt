insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason, but no punishment even
blood, will not be able to wash out the disgrace, which you have
suffered by me. Therefore oh King! allow me to propose a remedy, to
efface the shame, and to render it as if not done. Draw your sword and
knight me, then I will throw down my gauntlet, to everyone who dares to
speak disrespectfully of my king.’

“The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal, however it appeared
the wisest to him; ‘You are a knave,’ he replied after a moment’s
consideration, ‘however your advice is good, and displays prudence, as
your offense shows adventurous courage. Well then,’ and gave him the
knight-stroke ‘so I raise you to nobility, who begged for grace for your
offense now kneels before me, rise as knight; knavish you have acted,
and Knave of Bergen shall you be called henceforth,’ and gladly the
Black knight rose; three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor, and
loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the Queen danced
still once with the Knave of Bergen.”
