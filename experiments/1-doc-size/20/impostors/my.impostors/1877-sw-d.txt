'According to which agreement,' pursued the other 
without change of a hair, ' I am coming again some other 
time, to take her away, out of your care into mine.' 

'There go two words to that bargain,' said Mrs. 
Starling after a half minute's pause. 

' Two words have been spoken ; mine and her's. Now 
we want yours.' 

' Diana's got to take care of me.' 

' Does that mean that she is never to marry?' 

' It don't mean anything ridiculous,' said Mrs. Starling ; ' so it don't mean that.' 

' I should not like to say anything ridiculous. Then, 
if she may marry, it only remains that she and you should 
be suited. Do you object to me as a son-in-law ? '
