punishment, and yearning to her through the little distance, and
stretching out my hands toward her, and brokenly babbling her dear
name, she moved, and I saw her quite distinctly, even as I had seen her
that last time.  She stood midway between the unlighted parlour and the
lighted library beyond.  The drop-light with the scarlet shade blazed
behind her.

I noticed that to-night, as on that other night, the baby was not with
her; and I wondered why.  She stood alone.  She moved up and down the
room; she had a weary step.  Her dress, I saw, was black, dead black.
Her white hands, clasped before her, shone with startling brilliancy
upon the sombre stuff she wore.  Her lovely head was bent a little, and
she seemed to be gazing at me whom she could not see.  Then I cried
with such a cry, it seemed as if the very living must needs hear:--

"Helen!  Helen!  Helen!"

But she stood quite still; leaning her pale face toward me, like some
listening creature that was stricken deaf.
