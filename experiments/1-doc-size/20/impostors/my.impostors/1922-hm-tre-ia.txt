"I never heard of anybody who coidd," declared 
McClintock.  'I have had Kanakas who could read 
and write in Dutch, and English, though. The 
Kanaka — which means man —  is a Sandwich Islander, 
with a Malayan base. He's the only native I trust 
in these parts. My boys are all Sandwich Island

reared in the Vatican."

laughed. 

"What's that?" demanded McClintock. 

"The idea of a Malay, bom Mahometan, being 
reared in the Vatican, hit me as funny." 

"It woidd be funny —  just as a trustworthy Malay 
would be funny. I have a hundred of them —  mixed 
blood — on my island, and they are always rooking me.
