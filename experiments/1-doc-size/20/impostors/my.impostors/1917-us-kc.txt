It happened that Mike Sikoria had been working 
nearby, and was one of those who helped to get the victim 
out. Mike's negro " buddy " had been in too great haste 
to get some of the rock out of the way, and had got his 
hand crushed, and would not be able to work for a month 
or so. Mike told Hal about it, in his broken English. It 
was a terrible thing to see a man trapped like that, gasping, 
his eyes almost popping out of his head. Fortunately he 
was a young fellow, and had no family. 

Hal asked what they would do with the body ; the answer 
was they would bury him in the morning. The company 
had a piece of ground up the canyon. 

" But won't they have an inquest ? " he inquired. 

" Inques' ? " repeated the other. " What's he ? " 

" Doesn't the coroner see the body ? "
