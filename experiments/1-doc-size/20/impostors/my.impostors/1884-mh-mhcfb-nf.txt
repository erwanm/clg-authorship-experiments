    One half cup of molasses.

    Two teaspoonfuls of salt.

    Soda, the size of a pea.

    Half the quantity of sponge given in preceding receipt.

    Warm water for rinsing bowl—about half a cup.

Put the brown or Graham flour unsifted into the bread-bowl. Sift
into it white flour, meal and salt, and stir up well while dry. Into
the “crater” dug out in the middle, pour the sponge, warm water, the
molasses, and soda dissolved in hot water. Knead as you would white
bread, and set aside for the rising. It will not swell so fast as the
white, so give yourself more time for making it.

When light, knead well and long; make into two loaves, then put into
well-greased pans and leave for an hour, or until it becomes more than
twice the original size of the dough.
