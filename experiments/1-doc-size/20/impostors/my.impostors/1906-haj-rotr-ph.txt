"I think we might as well take the boat," returned Jack Bartlett, a boy
who was but a few months older than Randy. "Have you your lines handy?"

"No, but I can get them in less than ten minutes."

"All right. Meet me at the dock in quarter of an hour. I was thinking
of going up the river to Landy's Hole. That's a good spot, isn't it?"

"I think so. Last season I was up there and caught fourteen good-sized
fish."

"They tell me you are one of the best fishermen in Riverport, Randy,"
went on Jack Bartlett, admiringly. "What is the secret of your
success?"

"I don't know unless it is patience," answered Randy, with a broad
smile. "To catch fish you must be patient. Now when I caught my mess of
fourteen two other boys were up to the Hole. But just because the fish
did not bite right away they moved away, further up the river. But by
doing that they got only about half as many as myself."
