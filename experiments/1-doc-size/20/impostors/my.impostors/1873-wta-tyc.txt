"You are too late, Don John," laughed Laud Cavendish, who was standing
within hearing distance, and who now stepped forward, raised his hat,
bowed, and smirked. "I have already ordered the painter to inscribe that
word on the bows and stern of the Juno, for I never liked her present
name."

Nellie blushed deeper than before, but it was with anger this time,
though she made no reply to Laud's impudent remark. At this moment Mr.
Rodman invited the party to gather around the tables and partake of the
collation.

"Will Miss Patterdale allow me to offer her my arm?" added Laud, as he
thrust his elbow up before her.

"No, I thank you," she replied, walking towards the tables, but keeping
at Donald's side.
