went downstairs and found Mr. Richmond. He stretched out his hand to
David, which the boy took with a flitting change of colour that told of
some difficulty of self-command. However in a moment his words were
firm.

"I have found my Messiah, sir, where you bade me look for him. He is
my Messiah, and my King, and I am his servant. I wish I could be his
servant twenty times over!"

"Why?"

"One life is too little to give."
