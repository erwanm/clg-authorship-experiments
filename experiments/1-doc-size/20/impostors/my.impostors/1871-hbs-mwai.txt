"O, bless you, child," said Alice, "that's what Jim is for; he always
makes me laugh, and I like to laugh."

"Don't you think that Mr. Henderson would do nicely for Ida," said Aunt
Maria.

"Oh, as to that," said Alice, "neither he nor Jim Fellows are marrying
men. You see they haven't anything, and of course that they can't be
thinking of such things."

"But," said Aunt Maria, "Ida is just the wife for a poor man. She has a
turn for economy, and doesn't care for dress and show; and could rub and
scrub along, and help to support the family. I really think she likes
work for the sake of it. I wish to mercy she could be engaged, and get
all these dreadful queer plans and notions out of her head. I am always
so puzzled what in the world to tell people when they ask why she
doesn't visit and go into society."

"Why not tell the truth," said Eva, "that she prefers to help papa in
his business."
