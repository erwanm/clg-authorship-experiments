him across the mouth, and he promptly knocked me down."
"Pretty good punch for a youngster," was Cunningham's comment.
"It was," replied Cleigh, grimly. "He went directly to his room, packed,
and cleared out. In that he acted wisely, for at that moment I would have
cast him out had he come with an apology. But the following day I could
not find him; nor did I get track of him until weeks later. He had married
the woman and then found her out. That's all cleared off the slate,
though. She's been married and divorced three times since then."
"Did you expect to see him over here?"
"In Shanghai? No. The sight of him rather knocked me about. You
understand? It was his place to make the first sign. He was in the wrong,
and he has known it all these seven years."
"No," said Jane, "it was your place to make the first advance. If you had
been a comrade to him in his boyhood he would never have been in the
wrong."
"But I gave him everything!"
"Everything but love. Did you ever tell him a fairy story?"
"A fairy story!" Cleigh's face was the essence of bewilderment.
"You put him in the care of a lovable old dreamer, and then expected him
to accept life as you knew it."
