"Sally, you do love me. It cannot but be. You are a woman; you could not
have been with me as we have and not feel more than friendship."

"Oh, you men!--your conceit passes understanding," said Sally. "You
think we are born to be your bond slaves,--but for once you are
mistaken, sir. I don't love you; and what's more, you don't love
me,--you know you don't; you know that you love somebody else. You love
Mara,--you know you do; there's no truth in you," she said, rising
indignantly.

Moses felt himself color. There was an embarrassed pause, and then he
answered,--

"Sally, why should I love Mara? Her heart is all given to another,--you
yourself know it."

"I don't know it either," said Sally; "I know it isn't so."

"But you gave me to understand so."
