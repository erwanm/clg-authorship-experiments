  

"Yes," said March, "I wish it didn't make me 
feel so sneaking. What a long day it's been! It 
seems like a century since I got up." 

" Yes, a thousand years. Is there anything else 
left to happen ? " 

"I hope not. I 'd like to go to bed." 

"Why, aren't yon going to the theatre?" wailed 
Bella, coming in upon her fatlicr's desperate ex- 
pression. 

"The theatre? Oh yes, certainly! I meant 
after we got home," and March amused himself at 
the puzzled countenance of the child. " Come on ! 
Is Tom ready ? " 



VIII. 

FuLKERSON parted with the Marches in such 
trouble of mind that he did not feel able to meet 
that night the people whom he usually kept so gay 
at Mrs. Leighton's table. He went to Maroni's for 
his dinner, for this reason, and for others more 
obscure. He could not expect to do anything more 
with Dryfoos at once ; he knew that Dryfoos must 
feel that he had already made an extreme concession 
to March, and he believed that if he was to get anj'- 
thing more from him it must be after Dryfoos had 
dined. But he was not without the hope, Aaguo 
and indefinite as it might be, that he should find 
Lindau at Maroni's, and perhaps should get some 
concession from him, some word of regret or apology 
which he could report to Dryfoos, and at least make 
the means of reopening the afi'air with him ; perhaps 
Lindau, when he knew how matters stood, would 
back down altogether, and for March's sake would 
withdraw from all connection with Every Other Week 
himself, and so leave everything serene. Fulkerson 
felt capable, in his desperation, of delicately suggest- 
ing such a course to Lindau, or even of plainly 
advising it : he did not care for Lindau a great 



  

(leal, and lie did care a great deal for the 
maiiWellazino. 

Diit lie did not find Lindau at Maroni's ; lie only 
found Bi'aton. He sat looking at the doorway as 
I'ulkerson entered, and Fulkerson naturally came 
and took a place at his table. Something in 
Beaton's large-eyed solemnity of aspect invited Ful- 
kerson to confidence, and he said, as he pulled his 
napkin open and strung it, still a little damp (as the 
scanty, often-wa.shed linen at Maroni's was ai)t to 
be), across his knees, " I was looking for you this 
morning, to talk "with you about the Christmas 
number, and I was a good deal worked up because I 
couldn't find you; but I guess I might as well have 
spared myself my emotions." 

"Why V asked Beaton briefly. 

" Well, I don't know as there 's going to be any 
Christmas number." 

"Why ? " Beaton asked again. 

" Eow between the financial angel and the literary 
editor about the chief translator and polyglot smeller." 

" Lindau ? " 

"Lindau is his name." 

" What does the literary editor expect after 
Lindau's expression of his views last night ? " 

" I don't know what he expected, but the; ground 
he took with the old man was that as Lindau's 
opinions didn't characterise his work on the maga- 
zine he would not be made the instrument of 
punishing him for them : the old man wanted him 
turned oil', as he calls it," 



  

"Seems to be pretty good ground," said Beaton 
impartially, while he speculated, with a dull trouble 
at lieart, on the effect the row would have on his 
own fortunes. His late visit home had made him 
feel that the claim of his family upon him for some 
repayment of help given could not be much longer 
delayed ; with his mother sick and his father grow- 
ing old, he must begin to do something for them, 
but up to this time he had spent his salary even 
faster than he had earned it : when Fulkerson came 
in he was wondering whether ho could get him to 
increase it, if he threatened to give up his work, 
and he wished that he was enough in love with 
Margaret Vance, or even Christine Dryfoos, to 
marry her, only to end in the sorrowful conviction 
that he was really in love with Alma Leighton, who 
had no money, and who had apparently no wish to 
be married for love, even. "And what are you 
going to do about it ] " he asked listlessly. 

"Be dogged if I know what I 'm going to do about
