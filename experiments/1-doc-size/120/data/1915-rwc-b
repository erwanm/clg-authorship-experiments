here guys what you reelize, or what you don t? 
I ask you, Doc?" 

He spat disgustedly upon the sand, rolled 
his quid into the other cheek, wiped his thin 
lips with the back of his right hand, then his 
fingers mechanically sought the trigger guard 









again and he cast a perfunctory squint up at 
the parapet. 

"Believe me," he said, "a guy can veeve him 
self into any kind of trouble if he yells loud 
enough. I'm getting mine." 

"Well, Duck," I said, "it's a good game " 

"Aw," he retorted angrily, "it ain't my graft 
an* you know it. What do I care who veeve's 
over here? An the 50th Ward goin to hell 
an all!" 

I strove to readjust my mind to understand 
what he had said. I was, you know, that year, 
the Citizen's Anti-Graft leader in the 50th 
Ward. ... I am, still, if I live; and if I 
ever can get anything into my head except the 
stupendous din of this war and the cataclysmic 
problems depending upon its outcome. . . . 
Well, it was odd to remember that petty political conflict as I stood there in the trenches 
under the gigantic shadow of world-wide disaster to find myself there, talking with this 
sallow, wiry, shifty ward leader this corrupt 
little local tyrant whom I had opposed in the 
50th Ward this ex-lightweight bruiser, ex- 
gunman this dirty little political procurer who 









had been and was everything brutal, stealthy, 
and corrupt. 

I looked at him curiously; turned and glanced 
along the line where, presently, I recognized 
his two familiars, Heinie Bauni and Pick-em- 
up Joe Brady with whom he had started off to 
"Parus" on a month's summer junket, and with 
whom he had stumbled so ludicrously into the 
riff-raff ranks of the 3rd Foreign Legion. 
Doubtless the 1st and 2nd Legions couldn't 
stand him and his two friends, although in one 
company there were many Americans serving. 

Thinking of these things, the thunder of the 
cannonade shaking sand from the parapet, I became conscious that the rat eyes of Duck Wer 
ner were furtively watching me. 

"You can do me dirt, now, can't you, Doc?" 
he said with a leer. 

"How do you mean?" 

"Aw, as if I had to tell you. I got some sense 
left." 

Suddenly his sallow visage under the iron 
helmet became distorted with helpless fury; he 
fairly snarled ; his thin lips writhed as he spat 
out the suspicion which had seized him: 









"By God, Doc, if you do that! if you leave 
me here caged up an go home an raise hell 
in the 50th with me an Joe here 

After a breathless pause: "Well," said I, 
"what will you do about it?" for he was look 
ing murder at me. 

Neither of us spoke again for a few mo 
ments; an officer, smoking a cigarette, came up 
between Heinie and Pick-em-up Joe, adjusted 
a periscope and set his eye to it. Through 
the sky above us the shells raced as though 
hundreds of shaky express trains were rushing overhead on rickety aerial tracks, deafening the world with their outrageous clatter. 

"Listen, Doc " 

I looked up into his altered face a sallow, 
earnest face, fiercely intent. Every atom of 
the man's intelligence was alert, concentrated 
on me, on my expression, on my slightest 
movement. 

"Doc," he said, "let's talk business. We're men, we are, you an me. I've fought you 
plenty times. I know. An I guess you are 
on to me, too. I ain't no squealer; you know 
that anyway. Perhaps I'm everything else
