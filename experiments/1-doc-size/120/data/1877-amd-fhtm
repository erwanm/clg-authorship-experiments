their course from the beginning of the war. It was abom- 
inable ! — as if he could help or hinder in any way. If I 
had been in his place, I should have jumped up, mad as a 
hornet, and said, ‘Good-evening, Miss Durant.’ But he 
didn’t. Then I said I was very sure that I did not love 
him: we never should agree; I loved to flirt, and he 
had a tendency toward jealousy. He insisted that it was 
only because he loved me so much, and did not feel sure 
of me. And — oh! I can’t remember it all; but I did 
Anally promise to think of it, with a most sublime indiffer- 
ence to consequences. And then he made me take the 
ring. I could throw it away, he said. He had bought 
it for me ; and no other woman should have it. And, O 
Chris ! do you suppose it is true that he has never loved 
any one? That makes me stop and think. He is thirty 





now ; and love, like measles, seems to be harder for peo- 
ple, the older they grow.” 

“ How ridiculous you are, Theo ! ” 

“I know it.” And her comically-demure air of peni- 
tence was laughable. 

Why did he love her? Was it a man’s earnest, entire 
passion, or partly pique, and a desire to conquer, because 
she was so subtly elusive ? I looked her all over as she 
stood there in her daring prettiness, — a bright, bewitch- 
ing butterfly. I could imagine a husband for her ; but it 
was not Mr. Ross. 

Was not the husband of my imagining quite out of 
Theo’s reach? If aunt Clara had no children, and wanted 
her for companionship and society — 

“ There, Chris ! ” she exclaimed suddenly, “ I am not 
going to give it another thought this whole day. Rose 
asked me to go out riding with her ; and I must get ready. 
Oh to be rich and gi’eat and free! But if you cannot 
have it of your own, and your neighbors ask you in to tea, 
you may look at their silver, I suppose. Don’t worry 
now. You will get a little crease in your forehead, and 
look old before your time.” 

She put on her hat, kissed the tips of her fingers, and 
sped away. 


CHAPTER XII. 

You may partake of any thing we say : 

We speak no treason.”— Richaud Third. 

That evening Miss Dinsmore’s lover made his appear- 
ance, — a Mr. Goiiverneur Van Kort, called, by his sweet- 
heart and all his friends, “ Van,” without further cere- 
mony. He was not much taller than she, very fair, with 
pale eyes and pale hair, and a dainty mustache, which I 
suspect was dyed a little, as it was of quite a commenda- 
ble brown, and improved his general appearance vastly. 
His features were small, his hands and feet exquisite. 
For gloves he wore ladies’ sevens, and w'as duly proud. 
He belonged to one of the first families. His sister had 
married a Roman count. His father was to settle on him, 
or on them when they were married, five thousand a year, 
and they were to go abroad immediately. 

Mr. Van Kort had no ?’’s and an aristocratic drawl. 
Then he always said “ that pehson,” if an individual was 
not sufficiently high in position to be indulged with a 
name. Aunt Clara treated him like a foolish little boy, 
which he really appeared to like. The new partner in the 
firm was a Van Kort, a cousin it seemed ; but, if this was 
a specimen of the family, I thought they could not be 
worth much in the way of business. 

Rose seemed to adore him, although she privately con- 
fided to Theo that she had been engaged twice before ; 
but neither of the lovers was as rich as Van ; and she 
must go to Paris, dear Paris, on her bridal tour. 

 



“A mild, beaming young idiot, utterly free from such 
an ordinaiy endowment as common sense,” declared Theo. 
“ Chris, it makes me blush all over to think such people 
go abroad, and are taken for typical Americans. How can 
aunt Clara tolerate him ? and how did she come to have 
such a foolish daughter as Rose ? ’ ’ 

Rose was of the gushing, fluffy, infantile tye, who 
look up, and smile blandly in your face. Oddly enough, 
her sister, who was not quite sixteen, was so differ- 
ent. Miss Blanche was taller, thin, and rather sour- 
looklng, and set up for a genius. She read histories, and 
frowned on novels : she stumbled over German, and ab- 
horred French, “which mamma insisted upon her study- 
ing ; but it was too trifling for any strong, intellectual mind. 
Give her those profound German thinkers ! ” Water-color- 
ing, and dabbing with a pencil as she contemptuously 
termed sketching, did very well for children ; but hers were 
all studies from cartoons of the old masters. A leg, with 
a foot out of all proportion, and some enormous toes, or a 
wily hand with spider-like fingers outstretched, a bit of 
arm wdth a great bundle of muscles, and ugly faces that 
were caricatures, she displayed as her interpretations of 
true art. She insisted that she was near-sighted, and wore 
glasses ; but aunt Clara would not allow them in a general 
way. She was not out of course, and kept ostentatiously 
close to her ‘ ‘ study  ’ 

But it was gay and delightful. Military men were 
coming and going, with their picturesque uniforms, their
