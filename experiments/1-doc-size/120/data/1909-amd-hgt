“ Have you had a visitor ? ” Helen asked, 
after the first greeting. 

“ A visitor? No. Is there any one anxious 
to see me? We are to be off inside of an 
hour.” 

“ I’ve just had one. It annoyed and amused 
me. May I tell it over? ” 

He nodded. When she mentioned Mrs. 
Eastman’s name he gave a whistle. 

“ She is a silly, ill-judging woman. Does 
she think a teacher can spend all her life over 
one pupil? And to have the record changed! 
She will ruin the boy unless his father inter- 
feres. No, Miss Grant, she will not come to 
me; she knows better. She wants her son at 
home. She is fond of him. He is a rather 
good-looking attendant and he is smart enough 


 

to wheedle anything out of her. Well, per- 
haps I had better look after some of them a 
little more closely, or savagely — which?” 
Helen laughed, “ Mr. Underwood, I believe 
I do not like boys.” 

There was something so naive about the 
face that he laughed, too. 

“How about Millard and Harry White? 
Didn’t they find parting sweet sorrow yester- 
day afternoon? ” 

She turned scarlet. 

“ Did you never know any big boys ? ” 
“Yes, one who was splendid. We sat on 
the porch steps of a delightful old country 
house, and he taught me Greek. I hated it, but 
I had to learn it. My father compelled me 
to.” 

“ Was your father a teacher? ” 

“ He was at first, at Hope, where he married 
my mother. But he went to the East to dig 
among ruins, then was in the British Museum 
deciphering them.” 

“ And the big boy? ” 

She did not flush then, but glanced out of 
clear, tranquil eyes. 


“ He married a dear friend of mine last 
summer. She was in college two years in the 
freshman class. A dainty, pretty thing, who 
could write charming verses. They are an 
ideal couple; ” 

She wasn’t at all in love with him, Mr. Un- 
derwood ruminated. Men are quite as keen 
at scenting love passages as women. 

“We will make a little change on Monday, 
I think. I’ll consider it. But you may rest 
assured that Mrs. Eastman will not apply to 
me.” 

“ Thank you for all your kindness.” 

Mrs. Underwood was packing her flowers 
in a basket and gave her a gay adieu. But 
Helen felt glad she had gone. She really be- 
gan to like Mr. Underwood. 

Was it a month since she had commenced the 
new life? It appeared both short and long. 
So many events had occurred and yet it seemed 
not more than a fortnight since she had entered 
the schoolroom. She had meant to do so 
many things. Yet she had been out only once 
with the botany class. Two or three girls 
were painting from nature. Some of the 





younger boys were interested. The gym- 
nasium was not a favorite with the girls. 
Tennis did very well, but basketball they knew 
nothing about. She recalled the fact that 
some of the college girls only went to the 
“ Gym ” when they were compelled. 

She had gone to tea at the Millards’ and had 
a most enjoyable time. They were only in 
middling circumstances, but there was a great 
deal of simple prettiness about the house. 
Ruth, the small girl, fell quite in love with her 
and said: 

“ Oh, Miss Grant ! I want to be in the high 
school now. Allen talks so much about you. 
It’s two more classes and then Miss Parker’s. . 
I’m awfully afraid of her. The girls say she’s 
so strict. And she has such a way of looking 
right through you.” 

“No girl who is studious and obedient need 
be afraid of her,” was the reply.
