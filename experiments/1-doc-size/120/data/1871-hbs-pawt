“Seymour? pooh! he’s a muff and a prig. I bet you he won’t find her
out; she’s the jolliest little humbugger there is going. She’d cheat a
fellow out of the sight of his eyes. It’s perfectly wonderful.”

“How came Seymour to marry her?”

“He? Why, he’s a pious youth, green as grass itself; and I suppose she
talked religion to him. Did you ever hear her talk religion?”

A roar of laughter followed this, out of which Danforth went on. “By
George, boys, she gave me a prayer-book once! I’ve got it yet.”

“Well, if that isn’t the best thing I ever heard!” said Nichols.

“It was at the time she was laying siege to me, you see. She undertook
the part of guardian angel, and used to talk lots of sentiment. The
girls get lots of that out of George Sand’s novels about the holiness
of doing just as you’ve a mind to, and all that,” said Danforth.

“By George, Dan, you oughtn’t to laugh. She may have more good in her
than you think.”

“Oh, humbug! don’t I know her?”

“Well, at any rate she’s a wonderful creature to hold her looks. By
George! how she does hold out! You’d say, now, she wasn’t more than
twenty.”

“Yes; she understands getting herself up,” said Danforth, “and touches
up her cheeks a bit now and then.”

“She don’t paint, though?”

“Don’t paint! Don’t she? I’d like to know if she don’t; but she does
it like an artist, like an old master, in fact.”

“Or like a young mistress,” said Tom, and then laughed at his own wit.

Now, it so happened that John was sitting at an open window above, and
heard occasional snatches of this conversation quite sufficient to
impress him disagreeably. He had not heard enough to know exactly what
had been said, but enough to feel that a set of coarse, low-minded men
were making quite free with the name and reputation of his Lillie; and
he was indignant.

“She is so pretty, so frank, and so impulsive,” he said. “Such women
are always misconstrued. I’m resolved to caution her.”

“Lillie,” he said, “who is this Danforth?”

“Charlie Danforth—oh! he’s a millionnaire that I refused. He was wild
about me,—is now, for that matter. He perfectly haunts my rooms, and is
always teasing me to ride with him.”

“Well, Lillie, if I were you, I wouldn’t have any thing to do with him.”

“John, I don’t mean to, any more than I can help. I try to keep him off
all I can; but one doesn’t want to be rude, you know.”

“My darling,” said John, “you little know the wickedness of the world,
and the cruel things that men will allow themselves to say of women who
are meaning no harm. You can’t be too careful, Lillie.”

“Oh! I am careful. Mamma is here, you know, all the while; and I never
receive except she is present.”

John sat abstractedly fingering the various objects on the table; then
he opened a drawer in the same mechanical manner.

“Why, Lillie! what’s this? what in the world are these?”

“O John! sure enough! well, there is something I was going to ask you
about. Danforth used always to be sending me things, you know, before
we were married,—flowers and confectionery, and one thing or other;
and, since I have been here now, he has done the same, and I really
didn’t know what to do about it. You know I didn’t want to quarrel
with him, or get his ill-will; he’s a high-spirited fellow, and a man
one doesn’t want for an enemy; so I have just passed it over easy as I
could.”

“But, Lillie, a box of cigarettes!—of course, they can be of no use to
you.”

“Of course: they are only a sort of curiosity that he imports from
Spain with his cigars.”

“I’ve a great mind to send them back to him myself,” said John.

“Oh, don’t, John! why, how it would look! as if you were angry, or
thought he meant something wrong. No; I’ll contrive a way to give ’em
back without offending him. I am up to all such little ways.”

“Come, now,” she added, “don’t let’s be cross just the little time you
have to stay with me. I do wish our house were not all torn up, so that
I could go home with you, and leave Newport and all its bothers behind.”

“Well, Lillie, you could go, and stay with me at Gracie’s,” said John,
brightening at this proposition.

“Dear Gracie,—so she has got a house all to herself; how I shall miss
her! but, really, John, I think she will be happier. Since you would
insist on revolutionizing our house, you know”—

“But, Lillie, it was to please you.”

“Oh, I know it! but you know I begged you not to. Well, John, I don’t
think I should like to go in and settle down on Grace; perhaps, as I am
here, and the sea-air and bathing strengthens me so, we may as well
put it through. I will come home as soon as the house is done.”

“But perhaps you would want to go with me to New York to select the
furniture?”

“Oh, the artist does all that! Charlie Ferrola will give his orders to
Simon & Sauls, and they will do every thing up complete. It’s the way
they all do—saves lots of trouble.”

John went home, after three days spent in Newport, feeling that Lillie
was somehow an injured fair one, and that the envious world bore down
