Thyrsis would have preferred to sleep in his own 
study, as he worked so late at night; but Corydon 



 

begged him not to do this, she would rather be wakened, 
she said. 

So, on one occasion, he came over at about two o'clock 
in the morning, and found her sleeping, as he thought, 
and crawled into his own cot. He was just dozing off 
to sleep, when he heard what he thought was a stifled 
sob. 

He listened; he thought that she was crying in her 
sleep. But then, as the sound grew clearer, he sat up. 
The moonlight was shining in upon her, and Thyrsis 
caught a bright glint of steel. Swift as a flash the 
meaning of that swept over him. He had provided her 
with a revolver, that she might feel safe when she was 
left alone; and now he bounded out of bed and sprang- 
across the room, and found her with the weapon pointed 
at her head. 

He struck it away ; and Corydon, with a terrified cry, 
clutched at him and collapsed in his arms. 

"Oh Thyrsis !" she wailed. "Save me ! Save me !" 

"What is it?" he gasped. 

"I couldn't do it!" she cried, choking. "I couldn't! 
I tried I tried so hard !" 

"Sweetheart", he whispered, in terror. 

"Don't let me do it!" she sobbed. "Oh, Thyrsis, 
you must save me !" 

He pressed her to his bosom, shuddering with dread, 
and trying to soothe her hysterical outburst. So, little 
by little, he dragged the story from her. For three 
days she had been making up her mind to shoot her- 
self, and she had chosen that night for the time. 

"I've been sitting here for an hour," she whispered 
"with the revolver in my hand. And I couldn't get 
up the courage to pull the trigger." 

He clasped her, white with horror. 



 

"I heard you coming," she went on. "I lay down 
and pretended to sleep. Then I tried again but I 
can't, I can't! I'm a coward!" 

"Corydon !" he cried. 

"There was only one thing that stopped me. You 
would have got on without me 

"Don't say that, dearest !" 

"You would I know it ! I'm only in your way. But 
oh, my baby! I loved him so, and I couldn't bear to 
leave him !" 

She clung to him convulsively. "Oh, Thyrsis," she 
panted, "think what it meant to me to leave him. 
He'd have been without a mother all his life! And 
something might have happened to you, and he'd have 
had no one to love him at all!" 

"Why did you want to do it?" he cried. 

"Oh Thyrsis, I've suffered so ! I'm weary I'm worn 
out I'm sick of the fight. I can't stand it any more 
and what can I do?" 

"My poor, poor girl," he whispered, and pressed her 
to his heart in a paroxysm of grief. "Oh, my Cory- 
don ! My Corydon!" 

The horror of the thing overwhelmed him ; he began 
to weep himself his frame was shaken with tearless, 
agonizing sobs. What could he do for her, how could 
he help her? 

But already he had helped her ; it was not often that 
she saw him weeping, it was not often she found that 
she could do something for him. "Thyrsis, do you 
really want me?" she whispered. "Do you truly love 
me that much?" 

"I love you, I love you !" he sobbed. 

And she replied, "Then I'll stay. I'll bear anything, 
if you need me if I can be of any use at all." 



 

19. So their tears were mingled; so once more, 
being sufficiently plowed up with agony, they might 
behold the deeps of each other's souls. Being at their 
last gasp, and driven to desperation, they would make 
the convulsive effort, and break the crust of dullness 
and commonplace, and reveal again the mighty forces 
hidden in their depths. At such hours he beheld Cory- 
don as she was, the flaming spirit, the archangel 
prisoned in the flesh. If only he could have found the 
key to those deep chambers, so that he could have had 
access to them always !
