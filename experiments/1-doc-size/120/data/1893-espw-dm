" Sir," said Donald simply, " I've come 
to own up. Don't expel O Grian. He 
wasn't in that graveyard scrape. I was." 

When Donald got back to his room, he 
had lemons and sugar, and proceeded 
quietly to make his lemonade. Trouncey was 
asleep on the lounge, looking as miserable 
as a boy, when misery could not keep him 
awake, might be expected to look. 



 

Donald waited till the lemonade was hot, 
and then brought some (in his toilet mug), 
and waked the sleeper with a little push. 

" Come, Trouncey," he said gently, 
" here 's your lemonade. It 's piping hot. 
And you're not expelled, Trouncey. I've 
seen the President. It 's all right." 

Trouncey O Grian sat up sleepily and 
stared at Donald 's excited face. 

" The dickens you have ! Say ! Marcy ? 
well. Yes. Seen the President ! Good 
heavens ! But what in time did he say to 
you ? " 

" Oh, he didn't say very much," said 
Don quietly. "He told me the faculty 
would consider my case and let me know in 
a few days." 



CHAPTER VIII. 
THE FACULTY S VIEW OF IT. 

HARLE COLLEGE grew no calmer when 
the latest developments in the hazing scrape 
became widely known. Calhoun was be 
ginning to improve ; the fever had abated, 
and signs of intelligence in the sick boy 
returned. His doctor ventured to give a 
favorable prognosis for the outcome of the 
illness ; and the easy hope of the sanguine 
students bobbed to the surface gayly. 
College sympathy, now that the Freshman 's 
danger had decreased, lurched over to the 
popular Sophomore. 

Ben Braggs was expelled in good ear 
nest; and there was no more than the usual 
amount of college growling at this 
exhibition of discipline. But Braggs was not pop 
ular. He was a rough, fast, surly fellow, 
who had disgraced the university in other 
ways than heavy hazing, before this ; and 
he retired from the catalogue of the 
institution without any warmer regret than that 



 

vague amount of class feeling which the 
boys thought it proper to expend upon their 
departed comrade. 

With Donald it was another matter. 
Everybody liked Don Marcy too much to 
accept his disgrace. It was fought like a 
general injustice. Then he had done such 
a manly, honorable deed in sacrificing him 
self to save the prize-fighter 's son ; in the 
language of the boys, it was " such a square 
deal" that his immediate popularity was 
amazing. Instead of being the culprit of 
the faculty, Don was likely to become the 
hero of the college. This would have spoiled 
a vainer boy, or one with less basis of real 
sense in his nature. It might have hurt 
Don more than it did but for the sturdy, 
steady power of his chum, to which, in that 
hour of his humiliation and misery, Donald 
affectionately yielded. 

Jamie Fleet loved Don more than all 
Harle College put together did or could, 
and Don knew it ; but Jamie never flattered 
nor fooled him. 

In this case, he told him, frankly enough, 
that he had gone too far ; that he had done 
a cruel deed : " not manly," Jamie called it 
once ; and Don, who had never heard those 





iron words from anybody 's lips before, 
winced before his gentle friend. 

"Don't let the fellows gull you, Don," 
said Jamie Fleet. " It 's a bad business. I 
wouldn't forget that. It 's awfully nice of 
you to let up on Trouncey. But I don't 
see how you could have done less ; do you, 
Don?" 

" No," said Don mournfully. " I'm a 
gentleman and a man of honor. I had to 
let up on Trouncey." 

" I guess they 'll be easy on you," urged
