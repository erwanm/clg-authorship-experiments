" With what you know to be my natural tend- 
encies ? Your prophetic eye prefigures my panta- 
loons in the tops of my boots. Well, there is time 
yet to turn back from the brutality of a patriarchal 
life. You must allow that I 've taken the longest 
way round in going West. In Italy there are many 
chances; and besides, you know, I like to talk." 

It seemed to be an old subject between them, 
and they discussed it languidly, like some abstract 
topic rather than a reality. 

" If you only had some tie to bind you to the 
East, I should feel pretty safe about you," said 
Dunham, presently. 



 

" I have you," answered his friend, demurely. 

" Oh, I 'm nothing," said Dunham, with sincer- 
ity. 

" Well, I may form some tie in Italy. Art may 
fall in love with me, there. How would you like 
to have me settle in Florence, and set up a studio 
instead of a ranch, — choose between sculpture and 
painting, instead of cattle and sheep? After all, 
it does grind me to have lost that money ! If I 
had only been swindled out of it, I shouldn 't have 
cared ; but when you go and make a bad thing of 
it yourself, with your eyes open, there 's a reluc- 
tance to place the responsibility where it belongs 
that doesn't occur in the other case. Dunham, do 
you think it altogether ridiculous that I should feel 
there was something sacred in the money ? When 
I remember how hard my poor old father worked 
to get it together, it s.eems wicked that I should 
have stupidly wasted it on the venture I did. I 
want to get it back ; I want to make money. And 
so I 'm going out to Italy with you, to waste more. 
I don't respect myself as I should if I were on a 
Pullman palace car, speeding westward. I 'll own 
I like this better." 

" Oh, it 's all right, Staniford," said his friend. 
" The voyage will do you good, and you 'll have 
time to think everything over, and start fairer when 
you get back." 

" That girl," observed Staniford, with characteris- 
tic abruptness, "is a type that is commoner than we 



 

imagine in New England. We fair people fancy 
we are the only genuine Yankees. I guess that 's 
a mistake. There must have been a good many 
dark Puritans. In fact, we always think of Puri- 
tans as dark, don't we ? " 

" I believe we do,  ' assented Dunham. " Per- 
haps on account of their black clothes." 

" Perhaps," said Stamford. " At any rate, I 'm 
so tired of the blonde type in fiction that I rather 
like the other thing in life. Every novelist runs a 
blonde heroine ; I wonder why. This girl has the 
clear Southern pallor ; she 's of the olive hue ; and 
her eyes are black as sloes, — not that I know what 
sloes are. Did she remind you of anything in par- 
ticular?" 

" Yes ; a little of Faed's Evangeline, as she sat 
in the door-way of the warehouse yesterday." 

" Exactly. I wish the picture were more of a 
picture ; but I don't know that it matters. She 's 
more of a picture." 

" ' Pretty as a bird,' the captain said." 

" Bird isn 't bad. But the bird is in her manner. 
There 's something tranquilly alert in her manner 
that 's like a bird ; like a bird that lingers on its 
perch, looking at you over its shoulder, if you 
come up behind. That trick of the heavily lifted, 
half lifted eyelids, — I wonder if it 's a trick. The 
long lashes can't be ; she can't make them curl up 
at the edges. Blood, — Lurella Blood. And she 
wants to know." Stamford's voice fell thoughtful. 



 

"She's more slender than Faed's Evangeline. Faed 
painted rather too fat a sufferer on that tombstone. 
Lurella Blood has a very pretty figure. Lurella. 
Why Lurella ? " 

" Oh, come, Staniford ! " cried Dunham. " It is 
n't fair to call the girl by that jingle without some 
ground for it." 

"I 'm sure her name 's Lurella, for she wanted 
to know. Besides, there 's as much sense in it as 
there is in any name. It sounds very well. Lurella. 
It is mere prejudice that condemns the novel col- 
location of syllables." 

" I wonder what she 's thinking of now, — what's 
passing in her mind," mused Dunham aloud. 

" You want to know, too, do you ? " mocked his
