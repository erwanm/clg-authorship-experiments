Hicks's gayety, however, was not to be quelled in 
that way. 

" Gibraltar wouldn 't be a bad place to put up at 
for a while," he said. " Lots of good fellows among 
the officers, they say, and fun going all the while. 
First-class gunning in the Cork Woods at St. Roque. 
If it hadn 't been for the res angusta domi, — you 
know wdiat I mean, captain, — I should have let you 
get along with your old dng-ont, as the gentleman 
in the water said to Noah." His hilarity had some- 
thing alarmingly knowing in it ; there was a wild- 
ness in the pleasure with which he bearded the cap- 
tain, like that of a man in his first cups ; yet he had 
not been drinking. He played round the captain's 
knowledge of the sanative destitution in which he 
was making the voyage with mocking recurrence ; 
but he took himself off to bed early, and the captain 
came through his trials with unimpaired temper. 
Dunham disappeared not long afterwards; and Stam- 
ford's vague hope that Lydia might be going on 
deck to watch the lights of the town die out behind 
the ship as they sailed away was disappointed. 
The second mate made a point of lounging near 
him where he sat alone in their wonted place. 

" Well," he said, "he did come back sober." 

" Yes," said Stamford. 

" Next to not comin' back at all," the mate con- 
tinued, " I suppose it was the best thing he could 
do." He lounged away. Neither his voice nor his 



 

manner had that quality of disappointment which 
characterizes those who have mistakenly prophesied 
evil. Staniford had a mind to call him back, and 
ask him what he meant ; but he refrained, and he 
went to bed at last resolved to unburden himself of 
the whole Hicks business once for all. He felt that 
he had had quite enough of it, both in the abstract 
and in its relation to Lydia. 



XVI. 

Hicks did not join the others at breakfast. 
They talked of what Lydia had seen at Gibral- 
tar, where Staniford had been on a former voyage. 
Dunham had made it a matter of conscience to 
know all about it beforehand from his guide-books, 
and had risen early that morning to correct his 
science by his experience in a long entry in the 
diary which he was keeping for Miss Hibbard. 
The captain had the true sea-farer's ignorance, and 
was amused at the things reported by his passen- 
gers of a place where he had been ashore so often ; 
Hicks's absence doubtless relieved him, but he did 
not comment on the cabin-boy's announcement that 
he was still asleep, except to order him let alone. 

They were seated at their one o'clock dinner be- 
fore the recluse made any sign. Then he gave note 
of his continued existence by bumping and thump- 
ing sounds within his state-room, as if some one 
were dressing there in a heavy sea. 

" Mr. Hicks seems to be taking his rough weather 
retrospectively," said Staniford, with rather tremu- 
lous humor. 

The door was flung open, and Hicks reeled out, 
staying himself by the door-knob. Even before he 
appeared, a reek of strong waters had preceded 



 

him. He must have been drinking all night. His 
face was flushed, and his eyes were bloodshot. He 
had no collar on ; but he wore a cravat and other- 
wise he was accurately and even fastidiously dressed. 
He balanced himself by the door-knob, and meas- 
ured the distance he had to make before reaching 
his place at the table, smiling, and waving a del- 
icate handkerchief which he held in his hand : 
" Spilt c'logne, tryin' to scent my hie — handker- 
chief. Makes deuced bad smell — too much c'logne ; 
smells — alcoholic. Thorn's, bear a hand, 's good 
flow. No? All right, go on with your waitin'. 
B-ic — business b'fore pleasure, 's feller says. 
Play it alone, I guess." 

The boy had shrunk back in dismay, and Hicks 
contrived to reach his place by one of those precip- 
itate dashes with which drunken men attain a 
point, when the luck is with them. He looked 
smilingly round the circle of faces. Stamford and 
the captain exchanged threatening looks of intel- 
ligence, while Mr. Watterson and Dunham subor- 
dinately waited their motion. But the advantage, 
as in such cases, was as on the side of Hicks. He 
knew it, with a drunkard's subtlety, and was at his 
ease. 

" No app'tite, friends ; but thought I 'd come 
out, keep you from feeling lonesome." He laughed
