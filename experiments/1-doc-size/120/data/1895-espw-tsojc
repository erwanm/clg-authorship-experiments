had broken up ; for three years the Priest had cher- 
ished his grudge, but he said nothing about so low a 
subject. Jesus had quite forgotten it, at the mo- 
ment ; he mildly returned the sarcastic gaze which 
frostily received him. 

But the ex-Priest had no mind to commit himself 
too far, in a matter whose importance was evidently 
considerable : he turned the prisoner over to Caia- 
phas. One silent, significant, Oriental gesture car- 
ried the powerful weight of the pontiff's advice to 
his son-in-law. 

The palace was well lighted and astir. Many 
church officers were to be seen; in fact, a secret 
session of the Sanhedrin, irregular, incomplete, and 
unlawful, was convened. The High-priest of the 
Jewish nation appeared in full canonicals to judge the 
case. His sacred robes rustled, stiff with embroidery. 
The light from the hanging lamps caught the mitre 
on his brow; across it blazed the jeweled words, 
" Holiness unto the Lord." 

The eye of Jesus lifted and rested on the mitre, 
but he did not speak ; he had not spoken. With 
the instinct of the orator, his hand stirred as if it 
would have indicated, by an eloquent gesture^ some- 
thing of the emotion of the moment. But Annas 
had ordered that the prisoner be not unbound ; his 
wrists were crossed behind him. His flesh, more 
sensitive than, that of a ruder man, had already 
begun to chafe beneath the ropes. 

It suddenly occurred to him to ask himself why 
he was enduring this petty indignity. There surged 

ithin him the rush of his own peculiar conscious-

ness of power. It needed but a thought's force to 
burst these bonds as if they had been cobwebs caught 
upon his fingers. AH his passionate love of liberty 

leaped, his foresight of worse humiliation to come, 

his sense of wronged majesty, his insulted innocence. 
His voluntary helplessness resented his conditions. 
He thought how easy to be free, quietly to effect the 
loosening of the rope, to point the finger silently at 
the mitre, to blast the unholy brow that bore the 
holy words, in a moment to turn his judges into his 
prisoners, to convert the palace into the background 
of such a scene as history had never witnessed. 

He thought of that to which he gave himself over 
if he accepted the natural course of events. He 
remembered how costly it all was. ..." Must I 've 
the sacrifice?" he asked. His breath came fast; 
Ms color changed; the pupil of Ms eye enlarged. 
The Priest, who had begun irritably to cross-ques- 
tion him, suddenly drew back before the expression 
of Ms prisoner. . . . 

There was a moment in which every man in the 
hall was aware of an oppressive exigency whose na- 
ture he did not understand. The swinging lamps 
in the palace trembled on their slender chains.

Down tike slopes of Olivet two timid figures stole 
away from the groves where the eleven had hidden, 
and like men who had been struck on the head and 
stunned, suddenly gathering theii* lost senses, ran 
through the valley and over the brook, hurried 
through the Golden Gate, and across the Temple area. 
Peter was ahead, and yet he kept falling behind as

impulsive people do, from misdirected energy. He 
stumbled and regained himself, and pushed on ; but, 
being now well within the walls, he ceased run- 
ning, that he might not attract attention, and made 
his way westward as naturally as he could, towards 
the High-priest's palace. He was moaning openly, 
and his rugged young face looked old. 

But the dearest disciple walked with his eyes 
upon the ground. He seemed to notice nothing. 
In the moonlight it could be seen that his lips moved 
dryly. "We all, we all forsook him," muttered 
John ; " and we fled."

Jesus stood before his judges with closed lips. 
They had not opened to blight his accusers, nor to 
defend himself. His momentary agitation had sub- 
sided into intense calm. The palace stood untrou- 
bled ; the council chamber was not disturbed ; the 
grim Hebrew faces, crowded in it, wore their natural 
expressions, touched only by unusual animosity. 
Nothing had occurred to startle. 

It seemed to one who, having some acquaintance 
among the guards, had effected an entrance to the 
inner court of the palace that escaped catastrophe 
vibrated in the air. It seemed as if anything might 
have happened. But nothing had. 

The Nassarene was suddenly aware that John was
