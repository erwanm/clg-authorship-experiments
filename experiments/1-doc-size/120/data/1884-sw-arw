The next day was given to the Tower. Mrs. 
Dallas did not go ; her husband was of the party 
instead. The inspection of the place was thorough, 
and occupied some hours; Pitt being able, through 
an old friend of Mr. Strahan's who was now also 
his friend, to obtain an order from the Constable 
for seeing the whole. At dinner Betty delivered 
herself of her opinion. 

" Were you busy all day with nothing but the 
Tower? asked Mrs. Dallas. 

" Stopped for luncheon " said her husband. 

" And we did our work thoroughly, mamma," 
added Pitt. "You must take time, if you want 
to see anything." 

" Well," said Betty, " I  must say, if this is what 
it means, to live in an old country, I am thankful I 
live in a new one." 

" What now?" asked Mr. Dallas. 44 What's the 
matter ? " 



 

"Mrs. Dallas was wiser, that she did not go," 
Betty went on. " I have supped fall of horrors. 
Really I have read history, but that gives it to one 
diluted. I  had no notion that the English people 
were so savage." 

" Come, come ! no worse than other people," Mr. 
Dallas put in. 

" I do not know how it is with other people. I am 
thankful we have no such monument in America. 
I shouldn't think snow would lie on the Tower ! " 

" Doesn't often," said Pitt. 

"Think, Mrs. Dallas! I stood in that little chapel 
there the prisoners chapel and beneath the pave 
ment lay between thirty and forty people, the remains of them, who lay there with their heads separated from their bodies; and some of them with no 
heads at all. The heads had been set up on Lon 
don bridge or on Temple Bar or some other dread 
ful place. And then as we went round I was told 
that here was the spot where Lady Jane Grey was 
beheaded ; and there was the window from which 
she saw the headless body of her husband carried 
by; and there stood the rack on which Anne Askew 
was tortured; and there was the prison where Arabella Stuart died insane; and here was the axe 
which used to be carried before the Lieutenant 
when he took a prisoner to his trial, and was carried before the prisoner when he returned, mostly 
with the sharp edge turned towards him. I do 
not see how people used to live in those times. 
There are Anne Boleyn and her brother, Lady Jane 





Grey and her husband, and other Dudleys innumerable," 

" My dear, do stop," said Mrs. Dallas. " I cannot 
eat my dinner, and you cannot." 

" Eat dinner ! Did anybody use to eat dinner, in 
those times ? Did the world go on as usual V with 
such horrors on the throne and in the dungeon ? " 

"It is a great national monument," said Mr. 
Dallas, " that any people might be proud of." 

" Proud ! Well, I am glad, as I said, that the sky 
is blue over America." 

" The blue looks down on nothing so fine as our 
old Tower. And it isn't so blue, either, if you could 
know all." 

" Where are you going to take us next, Pitt ? " 
Mrs. Dallas asked, to give things a pleasanter turn. 

" How did you like St. Paul's, Miss Betty?" her 
husband went on, before Pitt could speak. 

" It is very black ! " 

" That is one of its beauties," remarked Pitt. 

" Is it ? But I am accustomed to purer air. I 
do not like so much smoke." 

" You were interested in the monuments ? " said 
Mrs. Dallas. 

" Honestly, I am not fond of monuments. Be 
sides, there is really a reminiscence of the Tower 
and the axe there very often. I had no conception London was such a place." 

"Let us take her to Hyde Park and shew her 
something cheerful, Pitt." 

"I should like above all things to go to the 



 

House of Commons and hear a debate if it could 
be managed." 

Pitt said it could be managed; and it was man 
aged; and they went to the Park; and they drove 
out to see some of the beauties near London; Kichmond, Hampton, and Windsor; and several days
