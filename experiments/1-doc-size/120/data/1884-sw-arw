fore, and knew there were some fine marbles in 
the place; one especially, that I wanted to see again. 
I was alone that day, and could take my time ; and 
I went in. It is the tomb of some old dignitary who 
lived several centuries ago. I do not know what he 
was in life ; but in death, as this effigy represents him, 
it is something beautiful to look upon. I forget at 
this minute the name of the sculptor ; his work I shall 
never forget. It is wonderfully fine. The gravity, 
and the sweetness, and the ineffable repose of the 
figure, are beyond praise. I stood looking, study 
ing, thinking, I cannot tell for how long or rather 
feeling than thinking, at the moment. When I 
left the chapel and came out again into the glare 
and the rush and the confusion, then I began to 



 

think, mother. I went off to another quiet place, 
by the bank of the river, and sat down and thought. 
I can hardly tell you how. The image of that in 
finite repose I carried with me, and the rush of 
human life filled the streets I had just come through 
behind me, and I looked at the contrast of things. 
There, for ages already, that quiet ; here, for a day 
or two, this driving and struggling. Even suppose 
it be successful struggling, what does it amount to ? " 

" It amounts to a good deal while you live," said 
Mrs. Dallas. 

"And after?" 

"And after too. A man's name, if he has struggled 
successfully, is held in remembrance; in honour." 

" What is that to him after he is gone ? " 

" My dear, you would not advocate a lazy life ? 
a life without effort ? " 

"No, mother. The question is, what shall the 
effort be for ? " 

Mrs. Dallas was in the greatest perplexity how to 
carry on this conversation. She looked down on 
the figure before her, Pitt was still sitting at her 
feet, holding her two hands on either side of his 
head ; and she could admire at her leisure the well 
knit, energetic frame, every line of which shewed 
power and life, and every motion of which indicated 
also the life and vigour of the spirit moving it. He 
was the very man to fight the battle of life with 
distinguished success; she had looked forward to 
his doing it, counted upon it, built her pride upon 
it; what did he mean now? Was all that power 





and energy and ability to be thrown away ? Would 
he decline to fill the place in the world which she 
had hoped to see him fill and which he could so 
well fill ? Young people do have foolish fancies, 
and they pass over ; but a fancy of this sort, just at 
Pitt's age, might be fatal. She was glad it was her 
self and not his father who was his confidant, for 
Pitt she well knew was one neither to be bullied 
nor cajoled; but what should she say to him ? 

" My dear, I think it is duty," she ventured at 
last. " Everybody must be put here to do something." 

"What is he put here to do, mamma? That is 
the very question." 

Pitt was not excited; he shewed no heat; he 
spoke in the quiet, calm tones of a person long familiar with the thoughts to which he gave utter 
ance, indeed alarmingly suggestive that he had 
made up his mind about them. 

" Pitt, why do you not speak to a clergyman ? 
He could set you right better than I can." 

"I have, mamma." 

" To what clergyman ? " 

"To Dr. Calcott, of Oxford; and to Dr. Plympton, 
the rector of the church to which uncle Strahan 
goes." 

" What did they say ? " 

" Dr. Calcott said I had been studying too hard, 
and wanted a little distraction ; he thought I was 
morbid, and warned me against possible listening 
to Methodists. Said I was a good fellow, only it 



 

was a mistake to try to be too good; the consequence 
would be a break-down. Whether physical or 
moral, he did not say; I was left to apprehend 
both." 

" That is very much as I think myself, only not 
the fear of break-downs. I see no signs of that in 
you, my boy. What did the other, Dr. whom did 
you say ? what did he tell you ? " 

" Dr. Plympton. He said he did not understand 
what I would be at." 

" I agree with him too," said Mrs. Dallas, laughing
