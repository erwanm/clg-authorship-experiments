directed in “Practical Preliminaries,” and bake in small tins.


Jelly-cake

Is made by mixing the above cup-cake, leaving out the flavoring, and
baking it in “jelly-cake tins,” turning these out when almost cold by
running a knife around the edges, and spreading all but that intended
for the top with a thick coating of fruit-jelly. Sift white sugar over
the upper one or frost it.


Cream-cake.

Mix a cup-cake without spice or other flavoring, bake in jelly-cake
tins, and when cold spread between the layers this filling:

    One egg.

    One cup of milk.

    One half cup of sugar.

    Two rounded teaspoonfuls of corn-starch.

    One teaspoonful of vanilla or other essence.

Scald the milk in a farina-kettle; wet the cornstarch with a little
cold milk and stir into that over the fire until it thickens. Have
the egg ready whipped light into a bowl; beat it in the sugar; pour
the thick hot milk upon this, gradually, stirring fast, return to the
kettle and boil (still stirring,) to a thick custard. Let it cool
before seasoning.

Frost the top-cake, or sift powdered sugar over it.


Cocoanut-cake.

Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring with rose-water.

Whip the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth.

Add one cup of powdered sugar, and two thirds of a grated cocoanut.

When the cakes are cold, spread between the layers.

To the remaining third of the cocoanut add four tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar, and cover the top of the cake with it.


Apple-cake.

Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring the dough with essence of
bitter almond.

Beat one egg light in a bowl, and into it a cup of sugar. Add to this
the strained juice and grated rind of a lemon.

Peel and grate three fine pippins or other ripe, tart apples directly
into this mixture, stirring each well in before adding another. When
all are in, put into a farina-kettle and stir over the fire until the
apple-custard is boiling hot and quite thick. Cool and spread between
the cakes. A nice and simple cake. Eat the day it is baked.


Chocolate-cake.

Mix and bake as for jelly-cake, flavoring with vanilla. For filling,
whip the whites of three eggs stiff; stir in one cup and a half of
sugar and four tablespoonfuls of Baker’s Vanilla Chocolate, grated.
Beat hard for two minutes and spread between the layers and on the top
of the cake.


White Cup-cake.

    One cup of butter.

    Two cups of powdered sugar.

    Three cups of prepared flour.

    One cup of sweet milk.

    Whites of five eggs.

    One teaspoonful of essence of bitter almond.

Cream butter and sugar; add milk and beat hard before putting in the
whites of the eggs. Stir in flavoring and, lightly and quickly, the
prepared flour. Bake in small tins.


Frosting for Cake.

    Whites of three eggs.

    Three cups of powdered sugar.

    Strained juice of a lemon.

Put the whites into a cold bowl and add the sugar at once, stirring
it in thoroughly. Then whip with your egg-beater until the mixture is
stiff and white, adding lemon-juice as you go on. Spread thickly over
the cake, and set in the sun, or in a warm room to dry.


White Lemon Cake.

Make “white cup-cake,” bake in jelly cake-tins and let it get cold.
Prepare a frosting as above directed, but use the juice of two lemons
and the grated peel of one. Spread this mixture between the cakes and
on the top.


Sponge Cake.

Do not attempt this until you have had some practice in the management
of ovens, and let your first trial be with what are sometimes termed
