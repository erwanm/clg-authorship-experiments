he was forced to admit that the President, though a tall specimen of
humanity, looked very much like the rest of mankind--to borrow a phrase
from one of his illustrious predecessors.

Tom was too tired to wonder long at the grandeur of the Capitol, and the
simple magnificence of the President. The tents were pitched, and the
weary men were allowed a season of rest. In a couple of days, however, our
soldier boy was "as good as new."

"Come, Tom, it is about time for you too see something of the city," said
Ben Lethbridge, one afternoon, after the regiment had become fairly
settled in its new quarters.

"I should like to take a tramp. There are lots of congressmen here, and I
should like to know what they look like," replied Tom. "I haven't been
outside the lines since we came here."

"I have; and I'm going again! Fred and I mean to have a good time to-day.
Will you go?"

"Have you got a pass?"

"A pass! What a stupid! What do you want of a pass? You can't get one.
They won't give any."

"Then we can't go, of course."

"Bah! What a great calf you are! Don't you want to cry again?"

"Ben, you needn't say cry to me again as long as you live," added Tom. "If
you do, I'll give you something to cry for."

Tom did not like the style of remark which the other had adopted. He was
angry, and, as he spoke, his fist involuntarily clinched, and his eye
looked fierce and determined.

"Come, come, Tom; don't bristle up so. If you are a man, just show that
you are, and come along with us."

"I say, Ben, I want to know who's a baby or a calf, you or I, before we
go, I won't stand any more of your lip."

"Will you go with us?" demanded Ben, who was rather disposed to dodge the
issue.

"What do you mean by calling me a calf and a baby? And this isn't the
first time you've done it."

"Don't you know that every man in the regiment has been all over the city,
and without any pass? When I ask you to go, you begin to talk about a
pass."

"I choose to obey orders," replied Tom.

"O, you daresn't go with us."

"Come along!" said Tom, who had not yet learned to bear the taunts of his
companion.

"Get your pail."

Tom got his pail, and was immediately joined by Fred and Ben, each of whom
was also supplied with a pail. There was no water to be had within the
camp ground, and the men were obliged to bring it in pails from the
hydrants in the street. A pail, therefore, was quite as good as a written
document to enable them to pass the guard.

The party thus provided had no difficulty in passing the sentinels. At a
convenient place outside the line, they concealed the pails, and, for
three hours, roamed at will over the city.

"Now, Tom, you wanted to see the congressmen?" said Ben, after they had
"done" the city pretty thoroughly.

"Yes, but I have seen them at the Capitol."

"But don't you want to get nearer to them, and hear them talk?"

"Well, I should like to."

"Come with us, then."

Ben led the way down the avenue, and entered a building not far from the
railroad station. After passing through a long, narrow entry, they
ascended a flight of stairs, at the head of which the conductor gave two
raps. The door was opened by a negro, and they were invited to enter. At a
table in the middle of the room was seated a foppish-looking man who held
in his hand a silver box. As he turned it, Tom saw that it contained a
pack of cards.

"Where are your congressmen?" asked the soldier boy, whose eyes had been
opened by the appearance of the cards.

"They will be here pretty soon," replied Ben.

The foppish man looked at his watch, and declared they would come in the
course of five or ten minutes. He then took the cards out of the box, and,
after shuffling them, returned them to their place. Fred placed a
"quarter" on the table; the gambler put another by its side, and drew out
a card from the silver case. Tom did not understand the game; but his
companion put the quarters in his pocket.

"See that, Tom!" said he. "Got any money?"

"If I have I shall keep it."

"Put down a quarter, and make another."

"No, sir! I'm no gambler!" replied Tom, with emphasis.

"Quite respectable, I assure you," added the blackleg at the table.

"I'm going," said Tom, decidedly.

"Baby!" sneered Ben. "Afraid to play!"

"I won't play! I'm going."

The negro opened the door, and he passed out. Contrary to his expectation,
he was followed by Fred and Ben.
