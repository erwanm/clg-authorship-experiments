of the Sacro Cuore, from the peace of a convent, to this 
atmosphere of war.' 

' Yes ; I wish I were back again.' 

' You do not like what you have seen of the world, 
Mademoiselle ? It is very natural. If the world were 
always like this its attraction would not be dangerous. It 
is the pomps and vanities that are delightful.' 

' I wish they would begin then,' answered Donna Faus 
tina with more natural frankness than is generally found in 
young girls of her education. 

' But were you not taught by the good sisters that those 
things are of the devil ? ' asked Gouache with a smile. 

' Of course. But Flavia says they are very nice.' 

Gouache imagined that Flavia ought to know, but he 
thought fit to conceal his conviction. 

' You mean Donna Flavia, your sister, Mademoiselle ? ' 

'Yes.' 

' I suppose you are very fond of her, are you not ? It 
must be very pleasant to have a sister so nearly of one's own 
age in the world.' 

' She is much older than I, but I think we shall be very 
good friends.' 

' Your family must be almost as much strangers to you 
as the rest of the world,' observed Gouache. 4 Of course you 
have only seen them occasionally for a long time past You 
are fond of reading, I see.' 

He made .this remark to change the subject, and glanced 
at the book the young girl still held in her hand. 





' It is a new book,' she said, opening the volume at the 
title-page. ' It is Manon Lescaut. Flavia has read it it is 
by the Abbe" Prevost. Do you know him ? ' 

Gouache did not know whether to laugh or to look 
grave. 

' Did your mother give it to you V he asked. 

' No, but she says that as it is by an abbe, she supposes 
it must be very moral. It is true that it has not the imprimatur, but being by a priest it cannot possibly be on the 
Index.'

' I do not know,' replied Gouache, ' Prevost was certainly 
in holy orders, but I do not know him, as he died rather 
more than a hundred years ago. You see the book is not 
new.' 

' Oh ! ' exclaimed Donna Faustina, ' I thought it was. 
Why do you laugh ? Am I very ignorant not to know all 
about it ?' 

' No, indeed. Only, you will pardon me, Mademoiselle, 
if I offer a suggestion. You see I am French and know a 
little about these matters. You will permit me ?' 

Faustina opened her brown eyes very wide, and nodded 
gravely. 

' If I were you, I would not read that book yet. You are 
too young.' 

' You seem to forget that I am eighteen years old, Mon 
sieur Gouache.' 

' No, not at all But five and twenty is a better age to 
read such books. Believe me,' he added seriously, 'that 
story is not meant for you.' 

Faustina looked at him for a few seconds and then laid 
the volume on the table, pushing it away from her with a 
puzzled air. Gouache was inwardly much amused at the 
idea of finding himself the moral preceptor of a young girl 
he scarcely knew, in the house of her parents, who passed for 
the most strait-laced of their kind. A feeling of deep 
resentment against Flavia, however, began to rise beneath 
his first sensation of surprise. 

' What are books for V asked Donna Faustina, with a little 
sigh. ' The good ones are dreadfully dull, and it is wrong 



to read the amusing ones until one is married. I wonder 
why V 

Gouache did not find any immediate answer and might 
have been seriously embarrassed had not Giovanni Sant' 
Ilario come up just then. Gouache rose to relinquish his 
seat to the newcomer, and as he passed before the table 
deftly turned over the book with his finger so that the title 
should not be visible. It jarred disagreeably on his sensi 
bilities to think that Giovanni might see a copy of Manon 
Lescaut lying by the elbow of Donna Faustina Montevarchi. 
Sant' Ilario did not see the action and probably would not 
have noticed it if he had. 

Anastase pondered all that afternoon and part of the next 
morning over his short conversation, and the only conclusion 
at which he arrived was that Faustina was the most fascinat 
ing girl he had ever met. When he compared the result 
produced in his mind with his accurate recollection of what 
had passed between them, he laughed at his haste and called 
himself a fool for yielding to such nonsensical ideas. The 
conversation of a young girl, he argued, could only be
