The squire was not satisfied : hut the worst he 

could do was to commit Harry to the care of Jacob 
Wire, which was immediately done. 

" I am sorry for you, Harry," whispered Mr. 
Nason. 

"Never mind; I shall fry again" he repl'.d, ae 
he jumped into the wagon with his persecutor. 




CHAPTER VII. 


" Jacob, here is the boy," said Squire Walker, as 
he stopped his horse in front of an old, decayed 
house. 

Jacob Wire was at work in his garden, by the side 
o e the house ; and when the squire spoke, he straight- 
ened his back, regarding Harry with a look of min- 
gled curiosity and distrust. He evidently did not 
like his appearance. He looked as though he would 
eat too much ; and to a man as mean as Jacob, this 
was the sum total of all enormities. Besides, the little 
pauper had earned a bad reputation within the pre- 
ceding twenty- four hours, and his new master glanced 
uneasily at his barn, and then at the boy, as though 
he deemed it unsafe to have such a desperate charac« 
tei about his premises. 




"He is a hard boy, Jacob, and will need a little 
taming. They fed him too high at the poorhoue,'' 
continued the squire. 

" That spiles boys," replied Jacob, solemnly. 

" So it does." 

" So, this is the boy that burnt your barn ? " 

" Well. I don't know. I rather think it was the 
Smart boy. Perhaps he knew about it, though ; " and 
the squire proceeded to give his brother-in-law the 
particulars of the informal examination ; for Jacob 
Wire, who could hardly afford to lie still on Sundays, 
much less other days, had not been up to the vil- 
lage to hear the news. 

" You must be pretty sharp with him," said the 
overseer, in conclusion. " Keep your eye on him all 
the time, for we may want him again, as soon as they 
can catch the other boy." 

Jacob promised to do the best he could with Harrj 
whe, during the interview, had maintained a sullen 
silence ; and the squire departed, assured that he had 
done hie whole duty to the public and to the little 
pauper. 

" Well, boy, it is about sundown now, and I guess




we will go in and get some supper before we do an^ 
Store. But let me tell you beforehand, you must 
walk pretty straight here, or you will fare hard." 

Harry vouchsafed no reply to this speech, and followed Jacob into the house. His first meal at his 
new place confirmed all he had heard about the penu- 
riousness of his master. There was very little to eat 
on the table, but Mrs. "Wire gave him the poorest 
there was — a hard crust of brown bread, a cold 
potato, and a dish of warm water with a very little 
molasses and milk in it, which he was expected to 
imagine was tea. 

Harry felt no disposition to eat. He was too sad 
and depressed, and probably if the very best had been 
Bet before him, he would have been equally indif- 
ferent. 

He ate very little, and Jacob felt more kindly to- 
wards him than before this proof of the smallness of 
his appetite. He had been compelled to get rid of 
his last boy, because he was a little ogre, and it 
neemed as though he would eat him out of house and 
aome. 

After supper Harry assisted Jacob about the barn. 





anil it was nearly eight o'clock before they finished. 

" Now, boy, it is about bed time, and I will show
you your rooms, if you like," suid Jacob. " Before 
you go, let me tell you it won't do any good to try 
to run away from here, for I am going to borrow 
Leman's bull-dog." 

Harry made no reply to this remark, and followed 
his master to the low attic of the house, where ho 
was pointed to a rickety bedstead, which he was to 
occupy. 

" There, jump into bed afore I carry the candle 
off," continued Jacob. 

" I don't care about any light. You needn't 
wait," replied Harry, as he slipped off his shoes and
