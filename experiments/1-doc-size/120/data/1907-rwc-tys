"Phil--he became violent at times."

"Yes. And the end?" he asked quietly.

"A little child again--quite happy and content--playing with toys--very
gentle, very pitiable--" The hot tears filled her eyes. "Oh, Phil!" she
sobbed and hid her face on his shoulder.

Over the soft, faintly fragrant hair he stared stupidly, lips apart,
chin loose.

A little later, Nina sat up in the hammock, daintily effacing the traces
of tears. Selwyn was saying: "If this is so, that Ruthven man has got to
stand by her. Where could she go--if such trouble is to come upon her?
To whom can she turn if not to him? He is responsible for her--doubly
so, if her condition is to be--that! By every law of manhood he is
bound to stand by her now; by every law of decency and humanity he
cannot desert her now. If she does these--these indiscreet things--and
if he knows she is not altogether mentally responsible--he cannot fail
to stand by her! How can he, in God's name!"

"Phil," she said, "you speak like a man, but she has no man to stand
loyally by her in the direst need a human soul may know. He is only a
thing--no man at all--only a loathsome accident of animated decadence."

He looked up quickly, amazed at her sudden bitterness; and she looked
back at him almost fiercely.

"I may as well tell you what I've heard," she said; "I was not going to,
at first; but it will be all around town sooner or later. Rosamund told
me. She learned--as she manages to learn everything a little before
anybody else hears of it--that Jack Ruthven found out that Alixe was
behaving very carelessly with some man--some silly, callow, and
probably harmless youth. But there was a disgraceful scene on Mr.
Neergard's yacht, the Niobrara. I don't know who the people were, but
Ruthven acted abominably. . . . The Niobrara anchored in Widgeon Bay
yesterday; and Alixe is aboard, and her husband is in New York, and
Rosamund says he means to divorce her in one way or another! Ugh! the
horrible little man with his rings and bangles!"

She shuddered: "Why, the mere bringing of such a suit means her social
ruin no matter what verdict is brought in! Her only salvation has
been in remaining inconspicuous; and a sane girl would have realised
it. But"--and she made a gesture of despair--"you see what she has
done. . . . And Phil--you know what she has done to you--what a mad risk
she took in going to your rooms that night--"

"Who said she had ever been in my rooms?" he demanded, flushing darkly
in his surprise.

"Did you suppose I didn't know it?" she asked quietly. "Oh, but I did;
and it kept me awake nights, worrying. Yet I knew it must have been all
right--knowing you as I do. But do you suppose other people would hold
you as innocent as I do? Even Eileen--the sweetest, whitest, most loyal
little soul in the world--was troubled when Rosamund hinted at some
scandal touching you and Alixe. She told me--but she did not tell me
what Rosamund had said--the mischief maker!"

His face had become quite colourless; he raised an unsteady hand to his
mouth, touching his moustache; and his gray eyes narrowed menacingly.

"Rosamund--spoke of scandal to--Eileen?" he repeated. "Is that
possible?"

"How long do you suppose a girl can live and not hear scandal of some
sort?" said Nina. "It's bound to rain some time or other, but I prepared
my little duck's back to shed some things."

"You say," insisted Selwyn, "that Rosamund spoke of me--in that way--to
Eileen?"

"Yes. It only made the child angry, Phil; so don't worry."

"No; I won't worry. No, I--I won't. You are quite right, Nina. But the
pity of it; that tight, hard-shelled woman of the world--to do such a
thing--to a young girl."

"Rosamund is Rosamund," said Nina with a shrug; "the antidote to her
species is obvious."

"Right, thank God!" said Selwyn between his teeth; "Mens sana in
corpore sano! bless her little heart! I'm glad you told me this, Nina."

He rose and laughed a little--a curious sort of laugh; and Nina watched
him, perplexed.

"Where are you going, Phil?" she asked.

"I don't know. I--where is Eileen?"

"She's lying down--a headache; probably too much sun and salt water.
Shall I send for her?"

"No; I'll go up and inquire how she is. Susanne is there, isn't she?"

And he entered the house and ascended the stairs.

The little Alsatian maid was seated in a corner of the upper hall,
sewing; and she informed Selwyn that mademoiselle "had bad in ze h'ead."

But at the sound of conversation in the corridor Eileen's gay voice came
to them from her room, asking who it was; and she evidently knew, for
there was a hint of laughter in her tone.

"It is I. Are you better?" said Selwyn.

"Yes. D-did you wish to see me?"

"I always do."

"Thank you. . . . I mean, do you wish to see me now? Because I'm very
much occupied in trying to go to sleep."

"Yes, I wish to see you at once."

"Particularly?"

"Very particularly."
