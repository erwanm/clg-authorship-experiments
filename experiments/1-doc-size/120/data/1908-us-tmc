“Yes,” said he; and added with a mischievous smile, “I saw him
to-day.”

“I saw him last Sunday night,” said Mrs. Prentice, guilelessly. “It
was at the Church of the Holy Virgin, where he passes the
collection-plate. Isn’t it admirable that a man who has as much on
his mind as Mr. Waterman has, should still save time for the affairs
of his church?”

And Montague looked again at Lucy, and saw that she was biting her
lip.




CHAPTER VII


It was a week before Montague saw Lucy again. She came in to lunch
with Alice one day, when he happened to be home early.

“I went to dinner at Mrs. Frank Landis’s last night,” she said. “And
who do you think was there--your friend, Mrs. Winnie Duval.”

“Indeed,” said Montague.

“I had quite a long talk with her,” said she. “I liked her very
much.”

“She is easy to like,” he replied. “What did you talk about?”

“Oh, everything in the world but one thing,” said Lucy,
mischievously.

“What do you mean?” asked Montague.

“You, you goose,” she answered. “Mrs. Winnie knew that I was your
friend, and I had a feeling that every word she was saying was a
message to you.”

“Well, and what did she have to say to me?” he asked, smiling.

“She wants you to understand that she is cheerful, and not pining
away because of you,” was the answer. “She told me about all the
things that she was interested in.”

“Did she tell you about the Babubanana?”

“The what?” exclaimed Lucy.

“Why, when I saw her last,” said Montague, “she was turning into a
Hindoo, and her talk was all about Swamis, and Gnanis, and so on.”

“No, she didn’t mention them,” said Lucy.

“Well, probably she has given it up, then,” said he. “What is it
now?”

“She has gone in for anti-vivisection.”

“Anti-vivisection!”

“Yes,” said the other; “didn’t you see in the papers that she had
been elected an honorary vice-president of some society or other,
and had contributed several thousand dollars?”

“One cannot keep track of Mrs. Winnie in the newspapers,” said
Montague.

“Well,” she continued, “she has heard some dreadful stories about
how surgeons maltreat poor cats and dogs, and she would insist on
telling me all about it. It was the most shocking dinner-table
conversation imaginable.”

“She certainly is a magnificent-looking creature,” said Lucy, after
a pause. “I don’t wonder the men fall in love with her. She had her
hair done up with some kind of a band across the front, and I
declare she might have been an Egyptian princess.”

“She has many roles,” said Montague.

“Is it really true,” asked the other, “that she paid fifty thousand
dollars for a bath-tub?”

“She says she did,” he answered. “The newspapers say it, too, so I
suppose it is true. I know Duval told me with his own lips that she
cost him a million dollars a year; but then that may have been
because he was angry.”

“Is he so rich as all that?” asked Lucy.

“I don’t know how rich he is personally,” said Montague. “I know he
is one of the most powerful men in New York. They call him the
‘System’s’ banker.”

“I have heard Mr. Ryder speak of him,” said she.

“Not very favourably, I imagine,” said he, with a smile.

“No,” said she, “they had some kind of a quarrel. What was the
matter?”

“I don’t know anything about it,” was the answer. “But Ryder is a
free lance, and a new man, and Duval works with the big men who
don’t like to have trespassers about.”

Lucy was silent for a minute; her brows were knit in thought. “Is it
really true that Mr. Ryder’s position is so unstable? I thought the
Gotham Trust Company was one of the largest institutions in the
country. What are those huge figures that you see in their
advertisements,--seventy millions--eighty millions--what is it?”

“Something like that,” said Montague.

“And is not that true?” she asked.

“Yes, I guess that’s true,” he said. “I don’t know anything about
Ryder’s affairs, you know--I simply hear the gossip. Everyone says
he is playing a bold game. You take my advice, and keep your money
