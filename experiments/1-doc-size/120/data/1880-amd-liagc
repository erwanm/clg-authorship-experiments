luxurious, still she had missed the strong, sustaining 
affection. But to be plunged into this dreary desert ! 

" If I might go to my own room ? " she said, timidly, to 
Mrs. Thomas, as they entered the house. 

"Why, child, wait up and have some supper, do. 





Ranny's real good-natured now, and wants to see the 
pretty girl. I don't believe but what you could make 
quite friends with him. Come and see." 

"Oh no! no!" Titania cried convulsively. "I am so 
tired ! I do not want any supper. Please let me go to 
bed." 

"Let the child do as she likes!" said Owen Thomas, 
gruffly. 

" But it's so early." Then she caught sight of the tired 
little face. " Well," she continued, " maybe it will be best. 
There's nothing like a good rest, only it looks so queer to 
see a child willing to go to bed before dark. Come along, 
then. Your things are all up- stairs." 

She followed her hostess to the third floor, an old- 
fashioned attic, with dormer windows, the house being 
shared with another family. The Thomases had but one 
room up here. It was clean, but close and warm, and the 
bed looked inviting. 

" I expect you feel a bit strange, poor thing," and there 
was a motherly kindness in the voice. " Still, 'twould a 
been different if the woman that married what was her 
name ? had been any real kin. Blood's thicker 'n water, I 
always say, and you can't feel for anybody quite as you 
can for your own. I often think if I was dead there 'd be 
no one to care for Ranny, for fathers never seem to have 
the same feeling," and the illogical woman paused. 
" Shan't I help you take off your clothes ? " 

" No," said Titania, " And if you wouldn't mind going 
down-stairs." 

" O dear, no. But you're a queer little thing. Suppose 
I bring you up some tea ? " 

" No ! I don't want anything." 

" You're dead tired, that's it. I hope you'll rest comfortably. 
Good-by till morning." 

After she had gone a few steps she came back. 





" Maybe you'll leel safer to lock your door on the in 
side," she added, and changed the key. 

Titania locked it immediately. Then she threw hersell 
on the bed, and gave way to a flood of bitter, passionate 
tears. So young, and so miserable ! Cast out of home 
and love a thing for public amusement merely. How 
hideous it was! There were dim and undefined strivings 
of womanhood within, chaotic fancies, and remembrances 
that eluded her on every hand. Was life always to be 
thus? 

She hardly realized until now what a blow Kate's mar- 
riage had been to her, and she hated Mr. Chippenham 
with an unreasoning, impotent, but enduring hate. What 
would he do after he had taken all Kate's money ? Oh, 
if Kate could come back and care for her while she went 
on the stage, and if she could earn money enough for them 
both. And what right had Mr. Chippenham to sell her 
to this man ; for to her childish understanding she appeared 
as truly sold as the pretty dogs that changed owners now 
and then. First it had been Mother Mell who wanted to 
get rid of her, and then that vile, wolfish-looking man in 
the hideous den and Dick dear Dick oh, why did 
God take him away ! She did not hold against him the 
blows and severity, she remembered only the love, the 
care, the tenderness, and cried as if her heart were break- 
ing, until she fell asleep, still in her dress, overcome by 
sheer exhaustion. 

She felt rested the next morning, and the elasticity 
of childhood triumphed over its transient despair. Mrs. 
Thomas was kind, and Ranny not quite so terrible. The 
practice, too, was under more auspicious circumstances, 
and she pleased her new master better. 

But it was a trying change from her recent life of lux- 
ury and leisure. Perhaps it was well that the blow had 
come so suddenly, for to have brooded over it would have 
invested it with terrors too bitter to be borne. 





Escape might have presented itself as feasible if she had 
known more of the world, or less. But her past experi- 
ences had not been of the reassuring kind, and there was 
no one to whom she could turn. You cannot well con- 
ceive of a more friendless little being than this enchanting 
Queen Titania, who, if she had only known the magical 
word lying in her possession, like a rare gem picked from 
the highway, upon which no sign or seal of value has yet 
been set, would open the door of friendship and give her 
the delights of home, perchance lead to the restoration of 
that past, dim now even in dreams. 

Oh, how the cruel old world mocks us, after all J
