round it was because of a sudden quiet. On this occasion she 
had done the quietest thing she could do ; after embracing Mrs. 
Osmond, which was more striking, she had sat down on a small 
sofa to commune with the master of the house. There was a 
brief exchange of commonplaces between these two they always 
paid, in public, a certain formal tribute to the commonplace 
and then Madame Merle, whose eyes had been wandering, asked 
if little Mr. Rosier had come this evening. 
" He came nearly an hour ago but he has disappeared," 
Osmond said. 
"And where is Pansy?" 
" In the other room. There are several people there." 
" He is probably among them," said Madame Merle. 
" Do you wish to see him? " Osmond asked, in a provokingly 
pointless tone. 
Madame Merle looked at him a moment : she knew his tones, 
to the eighth of a note. " Yes, I should like to say to him that 
I have told you what he wants, and that it interests you but 
feebly." 
" Don't tell him that, he will try to interest me more which 
is -exactly what I don't want. Tell him I hate his proposal.' 
"But you don't hate it." 
 
" It doesn't signify : I don't love it. I let him see that, 
myself, this evening; I was rude to him on purpose. That 
sort of thing is a great bore. There is no hurry." 
" I will tell him that you will take time and think it over." 
" No, don't do that. He will hang on." 
" If I discourage him he will do the same.' 
" Yes, but in the one case he will try and talk and explain ; 
which would be exceedingly tiresome. In the other he will 
probably hold his tongue and go in for some deeper game. 
That will leave me quiet. I hate talking with a donkey." 
" Is that what you call poor Mr. Rosier ? " 
" Oh, he's enervating, with his eternal majolica." 
Madame Merle dropped her eyes, with a faint smile. "He's 
a gentleman, he has a charming temper ; and, after all, an income 
of forty thousand francs " 
"It's misery genteel misery," Osmond broke in. a It's not 
what I have dreamed of for Pansy." 
"Very good, then. He has promised me not to speak 
to her." 
" Do you believe him ? " Osmond asked, absent-mindedly. 
" Perfectly. Pansy has thought a great deal about him ; but 
I don't suppose you think that matters." 
" I don't think it matters at all ; but neither do I believe she 
has thought about him." 
"That opinion is more convenient," said Madame Merle, 
quietly. 
" Has she told you that she is in love with him ? " 
"For what do you take her ? And for what do you take 
me ? " Madame Merle added in a moment. 
Osmond had raised his foot and was resting his slim ankle 
on the other knee ; he clasped his ankle in his hand, familiarly, 
and gazed a while before him. "This kind of thing doesn't 
find me unprepared. It's what I educated her for. It was all 
for this that when such, a case should come up she should do 
what I piafer." 
" I am not afraid that she will not do it." 
" Well then where is the hitch ? " 
" I don't see any. But all the same, I recommend you not 
to get rid of Mr. Rosier. Keep him on hand, he may be 
useful.'"' 
"I can't keep him. Do it yourself." 
" Very good ; I will put him into a corner and allow him so 
much a day." Madame Merle had, for the most part, while 
they talked, been glancing about her ; it was her habit, in this 
328  
situation, just as it was her habit to interpose a good many 
blank-looking pauses. A long pause followed the last words I 
have quoted; and before it was broken again, she saw Pansy 
come out of the adjoining room, followed by Edward Eosier. 
Pansy advanced a few steps and then stopped and stood looking 
at Madame Merle and at her father. 
"He has spoken to her," Madame Merle said, simply, to 
Osmond. 
Her companion never turned his head. " So much for your 
belief in his promises. He ought to be horsewhipped." 
" He intends to confess, poor little man ! " 
Osmond got up ; he had now taken a sharp look at his 
daughter. " It doesn't matter," he murmured, turning away. 
Pansy after a moment came up to Madame Merle with her 
little manner of unfamiliar politeness. This lady's reception of 
her was not more intimate ; she simply, as she rose from the 
sofa, gave her a friendly smile. 
" You are very late," said the young girl, gently. 
" My dear child, I am never later than I intend to be." 
Madame Merle had not got up to be gracious to Pansy ; she 
moved towards Edward Rosier. He came to meet her, and, 
very quickly, as if to get it off his mind " I have spoken to 
her ! " he whispered. 
"I know it, Mr. Hosier." 
"Did she tell you?" 
"Yes, she told me. Behave properly for the rest of the 
evening, and come and see me to-morrow at a quarter past five." 
She was severe, and in the manner in which she turned her 
back to him there was a degree of conte'mpt which caused him 
to mutter a decenb imprecation. 
He had no intention of speaking to Osmond ; it was neither 
the time nor the place. But he instinctively wandered towards 
Isabel, who sat talking with an old lady. He sat down on the 
other side of her ; the old lady was an Italian, and Eosier took 
for granted that she understood no English. 
" You said just now you wouldn't help me," he began, to 
Mrs. Osmond. " Perhaps you will feel differently when you 
know when you know " 
He hesitated a little. 
"When I know what ?" Isabel asked, gently. 
" That she is all right." 
" What do you mean by that ? " 
"Well, -that we have come to an understanding," 
" She is all wrong," said Isabel. " It won't do." 
 
Poor Rosier gazed at her half-pleadingly, half -angrily ; a 
sudden flush testified to his sense of injury. 
"I have never been treated so," he said. "What is there 
against me, after all ? That is not the way I am usually con- 
sidered. I could have married twenty times." 
"It's a pity you didn't. I don't mean twenty times, but 
once, comfortably," Isabel added, smiling kindly. "You are
