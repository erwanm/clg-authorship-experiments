have been glad to chastise him.

"Miss Winslow," he said, "I hope you won't mind the rudeness of
this--ah, ragamuffin."

"Oh, I don't," said the young lady, merrily; "he amuses me."

"So he does me; ha, ha! very good joke," said the dandy, laughing too,
but not very merrily. "I hope you are quite well to-day."

"Thank you, quite so. But don't let me detain you, if you have an
engagement upstairs."

"I assure you," protested the young man, hurriedly, "that I have no
intention of going up at all."

"Then I must say good-morning, at any rate, as I am out shopping;" and
the young lady passed on.

"I've a great mind to flog you," said the dandy, frowning at Sam. "I
would if you wasn't so dirty. I wouldn't like to soil my hands by
taking hold of you."

"That's lucky for you," said Sam, coolly.

The answer was a withering frown, but Sam was tough, and not easily
withered.

"Aint he stuck up, though?" thought he, as the young man left him. "He
don't seem to like me much."

"Have you got any corns, sir?" he asked, thrusting a paper into the
hands of a portly gentleman with a merry face.

The gentleman laughed.

"Really, my boy," he said, "that is a very singular question."

"Is it?" said Sam. "I don't know why."

"Why do you ask?"

"Because Dr. Graham upstairs will cure you before you know it. It's
only a dollar."

"You are sure you are not Dr. Graham, yourself?" said the stout man,
regarding Sam with an amused expression.

"If I was, I'd wear better clothes," said Sam. "He makes lots of
money, the doctor does."

"You'd better learn the business, my young friend."

"I guess I will, if he'll learn me," said Sam. "It'll pay better than
standin' here, givin' away papers."

"Don't that pay?"

"Not very well," said Sam. "I only get ten cents a hundred."

"Can you pay your board out of that?"

"No, but I make commissions, besides," said Sam.

"How is that?" asked the stout gentleman, in some curiosity.

"If you'd gone upstairs, and had two corns cured, the doctor,--he'd
have given me a quarter."

"Would he really?"

"Yes, he would. Hadn't you better go?"

"I have no occasion for Dr. Graham's services, at present," said the
gentleman, laughing, "but still I don't want you to lose by me. Here's
a quarter," producing the same from his vest-pocket, and giving it to
Sam. "Isn't that just as well as if I had gone up?"

"Thank you, sir. You're a gentleman," said Sam. "Do you come by here
often?"

His new acquaintance laughed. "Every day," he answered, "but I don't
give away quarters every day. If you expect that, I am afraid I shall
have to walk on the other side of the street. Good-morning, and
success to you."

"Good-mornin'," said Sam.

"Well, here's luck," thought Sam. "I like this business pretty well.
I've made sixty cents already, and the doctor's goin to pay me ten
cents more. That'll buy me a good, square dinner, and take me to the
Old Bowery besides."

So Sam continued distributing his circulars. Some into whose hands
they were thrust did not appear to be suitably grateful; and, though
on the lookout for a customer, he did not succeed in finding any, till
by good luck the last circular was placed in the hands of a man who
was in search of just the relief which it promised.

"Where is Dr. Graham's office?" he inquired.

"Right upstairs, No. 10," said Sam, eagerly. "You just follow me, I'll
show you."

"I think I can find it without you," said the other.

"Oh, I can go up just as well as not," said Sam, who had a special
object, as we know, in serving as guide.

"Very well. Go ahead, and I will follow you."

Upstairs went Sam, the new patient following him.

"I've brought another," said Sam, as he burst into the office.

The doctor, though glad of another patient, was rather vexed at the
style of Sam's announcement.

"Very well," he said. "Sit down there, till I have leisure to attend
to you."
