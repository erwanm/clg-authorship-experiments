"How romantic!" interjected Rowena, with effu- 
sion. 

"Yes, my dear young lady, and how practical 
too, and economical. In Europe, beds in the hotels 
are not charged with the board, but separately — 
another saving, for we stood to our rights and 
paid for the one bed only. The landlords often 
insisted that as both of us occupied the bed we 
ought—" 

"No, they didn't," said Angelo. "They did it 
only twice, and in both cases it was a double bed — 
a rare thing in Europe — and the double bed gave 
thern some excuse. Be fair to the landlords; twice 
doesn't constitute 'often.'" 

"Well, that depends — that depends. I knew a 
man who fell down a well twice. He said he didn't 
mind the first time, but he thought the second time 
was once too often. Have I misused that word, 
Mrs. Cooper?" 

"To tell the truth, I was afraid you had, but it 
seems to look, now, like you hadn't." She stopped, 
and was evidently struggling with the difficult prob- 
lem a moment, then she added in the tone of one 
who is convinced without being converted, ' ' It seems 
so, but I can't somehow tell why." 

Rowena thought Luigi's retort was wonderfully 
quick and bright, and she remarked to herself with 
satisfaction that there wasn't any young native of 
Dawson's Landing that could have risen to the 
occasion like that. Luigi detected the applause in 
her face, and expressed his pleasure and his thanks 
with his eyes; and so eloquently withal, that the 
girl was proud and pleased, and hung out the deli- 
cate sign of it on her cheeks. 

Luigi went on, with animation: 

"Both of us get a bath for one ticket, theater 
seat for one ticket, pew-rent is on the same basis, 
but at peep-shows we pay double." 

"We have much to be thankful for," said Angelo, 
impressively, with a reverent light in his eye and 
a reminiscent tone in his voice, "we have been 
greatly blessed. As a rule, what one of us has 
lacked, the other, by the bounty of Providence, has 
been able to supply. My brother is hardy, I am 
not; he is very masculine, assertive, aggressive; I 
am much less so. I am subject to illness, he is 
never ill. I cannot abide medicines, and cannot 
take them, but he has no prejudice against them, 
and—" 

"Why, goodness gracious," interrupted the widow, 
"when you are sick, does he take the medicine for 
you?" 

"Always, madam." 

"Why, I never heard such a thing in my life! I 
think it's beautiful of you." 

"Oh, madam, it's nothing, don't mention it, it's 
really nothing at all." 

"But I say it's beautiful, and I stick to it!" cried 
the widow, with a speaking moisture in her eye. 





 

"A well brother to take the medicine for his poor 
sick brother — I wash I had such a son," and she 
glanced reproachfully at her boys. "I declare I'll 
never rest till I've shook you by the hand," and she 
scrambled out of her chair in a fever of generous 
enthusiasm, and made for the twins, blind with her 
tears, and began to shake. The boy Joe corrected 
her: 

"You're shaking the wrong one, ma." 

This flurried her, but she made a swift change and 
went on shaking. 

"Got the wrong one again, ma," said the boy. 

"Oh, shut up, can't you!" said the widow, em- 
barrassed and irritated. "Give me all your hands, 
I want to shake them all ; for I know you are both 
just as good as you can be." 

It was a victorious thought, a master-stroke of 
diplomacy, though that never occurred to her and 
she cared nothing for diplomacy. She shook the 
four hands in turn cordially, and went back to her 
place in a state of high and fine exultation that 
made her look young and handsome. 

"Indeed I owe everything to Luigi," said Angelo, 
affectionately. "But for him I could not have sur- 
vived our boyhood days, when we were friendless 
and poor — ah, so poor! We lived from hand to 
mouth — lived on the coarse fare of unwilling charity, 
and for weeks and weeks together not a morsel of 
food passed my lips, for its character revolted me 
and I could not eat it. But for Luigi I should have 
died. He ate for us both." 

"How noble!" sighed Rowena.
