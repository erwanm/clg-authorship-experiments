ever. "You'd see your friend Gathbroke, though. That 
would be jolly. Do take the money, Gora, and don't be 
a goose." 

' ' That subject 's closed. Don 't let me keep you. James 
told me that Maria is having a luncheon, and I suppose 
that means you are going out. I'll rest here for awhile 
if you don 't mind. ' ' 



CHAPTER XVI 



MORTIMER went off that night and got drunk. It 
was the first time in his life and possibly his last, 
but he made a thorough job of it. He took the precau- 
tion to telephone to the house that he was going out of 
town, but when he returned two days later he experienced a distinct pleasure in telling Alexina what he had 



 

done. Alexina, who still hoped that she would always 
be able to regard Life as God 's good joke, rather sympathized with him, and assured him that he would have 
nothing to apprehend from Gora in the future ; she had 
no more fervent wish than to keep out of his way. 



He found himself on the whole very comfortable. 
Maria was always most kind, Alexina polite and amiable, 
and Tom ' ' decent. ' ' Joan liked him as well as she liked 
anybody, and when the family spent a quiet evening at 
home he undertook to improve her dancing and she was 
correspondingly grateful; it had been her weak point. 
The fiction was carefully preserved that the Dwights 
were conferring a favor on the Abbotts and that all expenses were equally shared. In time he came to believe 
it, and his hours of deep depression, when he had pondered over his inexplicable roguery, grew rarer and 
finally ceased. After all he had had nothing to lose as 
far as Alexina was concerned; one's sister hardly mattered (Did women matter much, anyhow?) ; and his sense 
of security, which he hugged at this time as the most 
precious thing he had ever possessed, at last made him a 
little arrogant. He had done what he should not, of 
course, but it was over and done with, ancient history; 
and where other men had gone to State's Prison for less, 
he had been protected like an infant from a rude wind. 
He knew that he would never do it again and that his 
position in life was as assured as it ever had been. 





He spent a good many evenings at the elub, and Maria 
found him a willing cavalier when Tom "drew the line" 
at dancing parties. Alexina, who had sold her car to 
Janet and her new gowns to Polly, had announced that 
she was bored with dancing and should devote the winter 
to study. She spent the evenings either in her library 
upstairs or with her friends. Mortimer saw her only at 
the table. 



 

He wondered if Tom Abbott would rent the bouse 
every winter. A pleasant feeling of irresponsibility was 
beginning to possess bis jaded spirit. He made a little 
money occasionally, but be was no longer expected to 
band anything over when the first of the month came 
round â€” a date that had haunted him like a nightmare for 
four long years. He could spend it on himself, and be 
felt an increasing pleasure in doing so. 



CHAPTER XVII 



RAY naked trees; orchards of prune and peach and 
cherry, mile after mile. Orange trees in small way- 
side gardens heavy-laden with golden fruit. Tall accacias a mass of canary colored bloom. Opulent palms 
shivering against a gray sky. Close mountains green 
and dense with forest trees, their crests filagreed with 
redwoods. Far mountains lifting their bleak ridges 
above bare brown bills thirsting for rain. 

The heavy rains were due. It was late in January. 
Alexina and several of her friends were motoring back 
to the city through the Santa Clara Valley, after 
luncheon with the Price Ruylers at their home on the 
mountain above Los Gatos. As it was Sunday there was 
an even number of men in the party, and Alexina, maneuvered into Jimmie Thome's roadster, was enduring 
with none of the sweet womanly graciousness which was 
hers to summon at will, one of those passionate declarations of love which no beautiful young woman out of love 
with her husband may hope to escape; and not always 
when in. Alexina had grown skillful in eluding the 
reckless verbalisms of love, but when one is packed into 
a small motor car with a determined man, desperately in 
love, one might as weU try to wave aside the whirlwind. 

Jimmie Thorne was a fine specimen of the college-bred 
young American of good family and keen professional 
mind. He has no place in this biography save in so far 



 

as he jarred the inner forces of Alexina's being, and he 
fell at Chateau-Thierry.
