there is a large three-cornered jagged rag among 
Bub's rags ; the rat bit it yesterday ; it hangs down 
from his little trousers behind and wags as he 
trots. He put the rat into a hogshead to pay for 
it; and shut it down with that piece of board 
fence with which he provided himself last week 
(from Mr. Hayle's garden) for such emergencies. 
There is a richness about going to sleep over- 
night with the game for your morning's hunt in 
a hogshead, which is not generally appreciated 
by gentlemea of the chase. There is a kind of 





security of happiness, a lingering on the lips of 
a sure delight, a consciousness of duty done and 
pleasure in waiting, which have quite an individual
flavor. 

None the other coves know about that rat. 
You bet. Not much. Hi-igh. 

Bub's right shoulder chuckles at his left shoul- 
der, and his left shoulder chuckles at his right 
shoulder, and the jagged rag behind wags with 
delight. Won't he jab him now ! Hi-igh, there. 
Hi-igh ! See him ! He thinks he 's a goin' to 
cut 'n' run, does he .' He must be green. 

Away goes Mr. Hayle's board fence into the 
bean patch, and down goes Bub into the hogs- 
head. There 's a contest for you ! All Bub's poor 
little puzzling soul is in his eyes. All his old 
young face — the only old young thing in the 
dawning time — is filled and fired. Won't he 
have that rat .' Five hundred cascades might 
play upon the pure bosom of the river, and all 
the buttercups in Five Falls kneel for baptism, 
— but he 'll have that rat. 

The smooth, round cheek of the sky seems to 
stoop to the very hogshead, and lay itself ten- 
derly down to cover the child and the vermin 
from the sight of the restful time. 





Presently it begins to be very doubtful who 
shall cut 'n' run. And by and by it begins to be 
more than doubtful who must be green. 

At one fell swoop of anguish, Bub finds his 
dirty little finger bitten to the bone, and himself 
alone in the hogshead. 


Bub sits down in the bottom of the hogshead 
and grits his teeth. He doesn't cry, you un- 
derstand. Not he. Used to cry when he got 
bit. And holler. But got so old he give it up. 
Lor. Ain't he glad none the other coves knows 
now. You bet. Hi-igh. 

All the foreheads of the buttercups and clovers 
seem dripping with sacred water, when Bub lifts 
his little aged yellow face with the dirt and 
blood and tobacco upon it, over — just over — 
the edge of the hogshead to see what became of 
the rat. The cheek of the sky blushes a sadder 
red for shame. The sleepy pine-trees stretch their 
arms out solemnly towards the little fellow. The 
cascades are at play with each other's hands and 
feet. The great pulse of the dam, as sad as life, 
as inexorable as death, as mysterious as both, 
beats confused meanings into the quiet time. 





" Lor," says Bub in the hogshead, looking out, 
half pausing for the instant with his gashed finger 
at his sly mouth, — " Lor, it 's goin' to be a boozier 
of a day. I 'll bet." 

But the bells have waked, with a cross cry, and 
Five Falls starts, to stand for eleven hours and a 
half upon its feet. The peaceful time has slipped 
and gone. The pine-trees rub their eyes and 
sigh. The pulse of the dam throbs feverishly 
fast. The sun dries the baptismal drops from the 
heads of the buttercups and clovers. The dew- 
laid streets fill and throng ; the people have dirty 
clothes and hurried faces ; the dust flies about ; 
the East Street tenements darken to the sight in 
the creeping heat, like the habit of old sins 
returned to darken a sad and sorry life ; you see 
that there are villanous stairs and no drains ; 
you hear coughing and confusion from the 
woman's bedchamber overhead. You see, too, 
that the spotless cheek of the sky is blackened 
now by the chimneys all about, and how still and 
patiently it lies to take the breath of the toil- 
worn town. 

Only those tiny cascades play — eternal children — 
upon a mother's bosom ; as if the heart 




of a little child, just for being the heart of a little 
child, must somehow, somewhere, play forever in 
the smile of an undying morning. 

By means of stopping to have his finger bound,
