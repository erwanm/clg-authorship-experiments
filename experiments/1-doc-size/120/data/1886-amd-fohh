" What were they?" he asks. 

'' Longfellow and Taylor and Browning and Miss Mu- 
loch. I can't quite remember all. Tennyson we were 
allowed in school." 

'' What did you read to me that night?" he questions, 
with sudden interest. 

'' ' In Memoriam.' The doctor said something quiet, 
monotonous ; and that you know, is all in the same soft 
rhythm. I began at one place I like so much, — 

' If one should bring me this report, 

That thou hadst touched the land to-day 
And I went down unto the quay, 
And found thee lying hi the port —  " 


There is no dramatic effort in her cool, simple voice. 
He can see her walking slowly down to the quay, and her 
look of wonder as the ship lies there, her heavenly expres- 
sion as the ^' sudden hand" strikes hers. It is not the 
poet, but golden-haired, tender-eyed Doris. 

"And I went to sleep," he says, with a long, sighing 
breath. 

" After a while. You were so restless and so weak that 
the doctor was afraid — " 

" Yes." He knows what the long pause means. 

" You could not understand, but you heard the sound. 
That was enough, ^f ter a little you became quieter, and 
then you fell asleep." 

" You and your aunt saved my life, no doubt ; gave me a 
longer respite. I shall have a new love for ' In Memoriam.' " 

Easily as she flushes, no unwonted color comes into her 
cheek as their eyes meet. He wonders how any girl 
could be so utterly without artifice. 

" Browning is a great favorite of mine," he says. '' I 
went to call on him, and was delighted. I have seen a 
number of our American poets." 

She gives a wistful glance. His speech has opened a 
new world to her ; he sees that in her eyes. Now they are 
as blue as heaven, and look like softly undulating lakes, 
just stirred by the faintest zephyr. 

He is in the midst of an animated description when 
Mrs. Gilbert enters. They have nothing to look conscious 
about, and Doris is gravely serene. Why, almost any girl 
she has ever seen would have a young man making love 
by this time. Doris is going to be a rather difficult young 
woman. How can she give her a hint ? The girls of the 
real world seldom need them. 

"Mrs. Gilbert," Wentworth says some fifteen minutes 
afterward, "have you decided upon anything — any 
movement, I mean ? You surely are not going to stay at 
Novara all summer?" 



 



 



 

" I have been awaiting Mr. Gilbert's plans," she replies, 
rather evasively ; " but I am afraid — indeed, we are quite 
at sea, Doris and I. That is an Irish bull," and she gives 
a constrained laugh, "or a figure of speech. What I am 
afraid of is that we may remain, much to my dissat- 
isfaction." 

'' Must you wait for Mr. Gilbert? Can he not meet 
you somewhere ? " 

"Well, it will be very stupid after you go," ignoring 
his question. " Are you in a hurry to get away ? " 

"The doctor proposes a change. I am quite strong 
now, and in some ways Martin is an improvement on 
Louis, poor lad ! And I 've thought out such a nice trip. 
Why cannot you go on to Venice ? You will not care to 
be regularly settled anywhere before winter." 

"Venice!" There is such a look of anticipation in 
Doris's eyes. 

. " Yes. There is Milan, for a first stage ; then Bergamo 
and the lakes, Peschiera, Verona, Padua, Venice. They 
are a little off of the crowded routes, but will be delight- 
ful. You read Shakespeare, Miss Hawthorne?" 

" No," Doris answers simply, but with that wondering 
look. How rich the world is ! How many treasures there 
are for her ; that they are not for every one, she cannot 
comprehend at this stage. 

"And you've never seen a play? I should like to be 
with you at your very first one. Verona, you know, is 
famed for Romeo and Juliet ; and Padua," — he laughs, 
— " the wise young lawyer came from Padua, who settled 
about the pound of flesh." 

Doris is mystified. Now her face is simply delicious.
