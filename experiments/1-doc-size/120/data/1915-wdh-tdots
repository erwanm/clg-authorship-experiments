  But some folks find the other thing pure bliss--
  Lusty young chaps, like you.

  Morrison.                   And some folks find
  A sizzling radiator to their mind.
  What else have you, there, you could recommend
  To the attention of a country friend?

  Wetherbee. Well, you know how it is in Madison Square,
  Late afternoons, now, if the day's been fair--
  How all the western sidewalk ebbs and flows
  With pretty women in their pretty clo'es:
  I've never seen them prettier than this year.
  Of course, I know a dear is not a deer,
  But still, I think that if I had to meet
  One or the other in the road, or street,
  All by myself, I am not sure but that
  I'd choose the dear that wears the fetching hat.

  Morrison. Get out! What else?

  Wetherbee.                Well, it is not so bad,
  If you are feeling a little down, or sad,
  To walk along Fifth Avenue to the Park,
  When the day thinks perhaps of getting dark,
  And meet that mighty flood of vehicles
  Laden with all the different kinds of swells,
  Homing to dinner, in their carriages--
  Victorias, landaus, chariots, coupés--
  There's nothing like it to lift up the heart
  And make you realize yourself a part,
  Sure, of the greatest show on earth.

  Morrison.                           Oh, yes,
  I know. I've felt that rapture more or less.
  But I would rather put it off as long
  As possible. I suppose you like the song
  Of the sweet car-gongs better than the cry
  Of jays and yellowhammers when the sky
  Begins to redden these October mornings,
  And the loons sound their melancholy warnings;
  Or honk of the wild-geese that write their A
  Along the horizon in the evening's gray.
  Or when the squirrels look down on you and bark
  From the nut trees--

  Wetherbee.           We have them in the Park
  Plenty enough. But, say, you aged sinner,
  Have you been out much recently at dinner?

  Morrison. What do you mean? You know there's no one here
  That dines except ourselves now.

  Wetherbee.                Well, that's queer!
  I thought the natives-- But I recollect!
  It was not reasonable to expect--

  Morrison. What are you driving at?

  Wetherbee.              Oh, nothing much.
  But I was thinking how you come in touch
  With life at the first dinner in the fall,
  When you get back, first, as you can't at all
  Later along. But you, of course, won't care
  With your idyllic pleasures.

  Morrison.                   Who was there?

  Wetherbee. Oh--ha, ha! What d'you mean by there?

  Morrison.                              Come off!

  Wetherbee. What! you remain to pray that came to scoff!

  Morrison. You know what I am after.

  Wetherbee.                         Yes, that dinner.
  Just a round dozen: Ferguson and Binner
  For the fine arts; Bowyer the novelist;
  Dr. Le Martin; the psychologist
  Fletcher; the English actor Philipson;
  The two newspaper Witkins, Bob and John;
  A nice Bostonian, Bane the archæologer,
  And a queer Russian amateur astrologer;
  And Father Gray, the jolly ritualist priest,
  And last your humble servant, but not least.
  The food was not so filthy, and the wine
  Was not so poison. We made out to dine
  From eight till one A.M. One could endure
  The dinner. But, oh say! The talk was poor!
  Your natives down at Clamhurst--

  Morrison.                      Look ye here!
  What date does Thanksgiving come on this year?

  Wetherbee. Why, I suppose--although I don't remember
  Certainly--the usual 28th November.

  Morrison. Novem-- You should have waited to get sober!
  It comes on the 11th of October!
  And that's to-morrow; and if you happen down
  Later, you'd better look for us in town.

                              TABLE TALK


They were talking after dinner in that cozy moment when the
conversation has ripened, just before the coffee, into mocking guesses
and laughing suggestions. The thing they were talking of was something
that would have held them apart if less happily timed and placed, but
then and there it drew these together in what most of them felt a
charming and flattering intimacy. Not all of them took part in the
talk, and of those who did, none perhaps assumed to talk with
authority or finality. At first they spoke of the subject as it,
forbearing to name it, as if the name of it would convey an unpleasant
