self. Was it because she was tired that she should pause 
presently before the wide grate, and slip into a great cushioned 
chair, where Trewartha found her, with her eyes shut but not 
asleep, the firelight crowning her drooping head ? 

The fitful March day had vibrated from gusts to sunshine. 
Now a flurry of snow thickened the air and made a kind of 
hoar twilight. 

Trewartha went in search of Ruth, who was standing alone 
by the great basin of lilies, herself as white as they, save the 
crown of dusky hair. 

"Come," he said. 

She turned with a sharp pain. Would they not let her have 



 

a moment in which she could escape from the vivid picture of 
their love and happiness? And then she shook her head. 

" Go to Sylvia," she cried, with sudden heat and emphasis. 

"Sylvia is resting, curled up in a great chair like a kitten. 
Will you come and look at her ?" 

He reached over for her hand. It was cold and passive, and 
the lips trembled. 

" I will not disturb her," she said. "Go yourself." 

He laughed low and provokingly, reading what she thought 
so securely hidden. 

"Why are your hands so cold? And why are you pale 
and grave? Has the winter taken away your warmth and 
bloom ?" 

"You hurt me!" as his clasp tightened. "I came here 
to be alone, to think " 

"And of what avail is the endless thinking? Does it 
bring you any nearer the great truth ? Why do you not open 
the eyes of your soul, of your spirit ?" 

"Because I was born blind !" passionately. 

" No, you were not. No woman ever is until she makes 
some black, wilful blindness for herself. Look up at me, Ruth. 
Can you read any secret in my face ?" 

A faint color stirred in ,hers and the lips trembled. Then 
some power stronger than herself shook her very soul and 
forced her to speak over a great pang. 

"I think you love Sylvia Redmond ?" 

"Yes, I love her ;" and he smiled in his peculiar, wayward 
fashion. " I love her as one loves a child. I should like to be 
her father, Ruth, and have a right to order all her pretty ways ; 
to chide when she was too grave, as she often is now ; to have 
a brave young lover come, whose sjnile would bring roses to 
her cheeks ; to give her a wedding-breakfast in this old hall, 
and to keep her still, to see her children playing around my 
knees, and to kiss their soft, warm faces. Yet it may never 
happen." 



 

Her eyes opened wide with an intent, startled light. 

' ' And you read nothing else ?" 

" Let me go," she cried, as a quick pain pierced her very 
soul. 

' ' Why ? Am I so distasteful ? Ruth, you are jealous of 
Sylvia." 

"I jealous !" in a hard, hollow, incredulous tone, the lines 
about the mouth growing rrgid, and the eyes downcast. 

"Yes. Child, are you blind? Can you not see that I love 
you, you?' 

"No, I will not come between. She is sweet and fond. She 
loves you," with a strange, pathetic cry that moved his whole 
soul. 

"So, the lesson is all to learn. Janet McRae taught you as 
much as one woman can teach another : the rest is a man's 
province. Listen, Ruth, I am twice your age. In the hot, 
impatient days of youth, I had one mad passion-dream that 
burned to ashes before the woman lay cold in her grave. Yet 
if she had been true if she had loved me ! Will you dare to 
bridge over that broken path ? I am wiser, more patient, yet 
the boy's folly is not all gone. My soul obeys the universal 
law, but forgive if it demands the best. The night Mrs. 
McRae brought Victor Hurst home, I knew that I loved you. 
Have I not waited long enough ?" 

"Oh," she said, abashed and distressed, "I have no right ; 
for she " 

" Yes ; I knew her plans. I said, if this woman can love 
another, I will stand back. He is younger, fresher, and it is 
my friend's wish. But you could not " 

" No, I could not ;" with a shiver. "And I think he never 
loved me. If I am slow and grave and passionless " 

' ' My darling, hearts respond only to the touch which rouses 
them. There is much yet to learn. May I be your teacher?" 

She raised her eyes slowly and he read assent
