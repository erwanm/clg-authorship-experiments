"So far as I can put his incoherent story together, he never 
made his existence known until latterly. If he went to St. 

Albans, I can fancy her dread and mortification. Perhaps she 




felt that he had forfeited all claim upon her. We will not judge 
too harshly now. I am glad to know that Sylvia can begin her 
life afresh." 

Trewartha looked surprised at this mercy where he had 
expected strict justice and condemnation. 

" Have you seen the young man's father?" 

"Yes. I may as well confess that Mr. Gilliat feels ter 
ribly bitter. It was his only child. From all I hear, the 
youth could hardly have died at a better time." A slight 
expression of contempt crossed Trewartha's face. "But I would 
give half my fortune, or all, that it had not occurred." 

"You apprehend no danger to Victor? He must be 
acquitted i" she exclaimed, with her old vehemence. 

"Circumstances multiply. Gilliat was shot from the left 
side, at which Victor stood, so there can be no hypothesis of 
accident. His man declares that Victor had barely time to 
turn. The pistol was found out yonder." 

"Yes!" She was studying Trewartha's anxious face 
intently. 

' "Is there some subtle demon at the bottom of it all? 
The pistol has a small silver plate on which is engraved an 
<H.'" 

"My God! But you don't believe "and her strong 
features trembled in ashen dullness. 

"Until Victor Hurst confesses the deed I shall hold him 
innocent." 

"Thank God!" grasping his arm with eager, desperate pas 
sion ; "for I have come to love the lad in spite of his cold, 
unsocial ways. And I know he could never have done it." 

"But even-thing will go against him. The inquest is tc 
be held to-morrow. We shall all be called." 

" Do they think that I can swear his life away ?" she cried, 
with sharp anguish. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

WHEN Jules Duconge took the news of the murder to St. 
Albans, the whole house seemed horror-stricken. He told 
his story first to Mr. Milnor, for he hardly dared face Mr. 
Gilliat. 

Whatever hopes Kirke Gilliat might have had for his son 
in by-gone days, they had perished utterly during the last few 
months. A dozen years like the last two abroad would bring 
Rothermel near to the auctioneer's hammer. He and his wife 
had lived elegantly, sometimes to the extent of their income, 
and there was not much lying back ; but he had a hatred 
of debt. So a valuable piece of timber had gone to extricate 
Eustace. 

There was nothing noble, generous, or refined in the lad's 
nature. Exterior graces and foppishness he abounded in ; but 
the soul was unutterably indigent. His father not desiring to 
see his faults, appeared to be made all the more plainly 
aware of them, as sometimes when one's eyes are tightly shut, 
a past hideous sight will still linger. 

He could never quite forget what he had given up for pos 
sible children brave sons and beautiful daughters, not this 
one poor puny body, and coarse, shallow soul. Yet, now 
that he was dead, Kirke Gilliat beat his breast passionately. 
It was all he had. And with that, sweet, tender child, Sylvia, 
for wife, there might have been a nobler future. Perhaps he 
had been unjust all young men went astray at times. 

Half an hour afterward he sent for Milnor again. 

"Let me hear the man's story," he said, with feverish 
haste. "There must be some horrible mistake. What had 
Eustace done to make so bitter an enemy ?" 



 

So Jules was called in and questioned minutely. The 
story lost nothing at his hands. Not that he wilfully exagger 
ated, but his sympathies were with his master, who in his 
best moods had always been lavishly indulgent. The threats 
on the one side were softened down, and on the other, every 
word and gesture remembered. 

"Victor Hurst," Milnor said, thoughtfully. "I ought to 
know the name." 

"It appears to me that you mentioned it last winter when 
you were staying at Rothermel it's an unusual name, too." 

"Oh, I remember some trade outbreak in one of the 
northern towns and why, it must be the young man in 
whom Miss Lowndes was so much interested," with an expres 
sion of surprise at his own blindness. 

"That you were half-persuaded was a poor, struggling 
genius. But for me you would have taken him in hand. 
A coarse bully and ruffian."
