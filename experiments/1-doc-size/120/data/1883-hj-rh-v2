and asked several questions which had no connection 
with the Consuls and the Caesars. She had begun by 
saying that it was coming over her, after all, that Rome 
was a ponderously sad place. The sirocco was gently 
blowing, the air was heavy, she was tired, she looked a 
little pale. 

"Everything," she said, "seems to say that all things 
are vanity. If one is doing something, I suppose one 
feels a certain strength within one to say otherwise. But 
if one is idle, surely it is depressing to live year after year 
among the ashes of things that once were mighty. If I 
were to remain here, I should either become permanently 
low, as they say, or I would take refuge in some 
practical occupation." 

" What occupation ? " 



 

" I would open a school for those beautiful little 
beggars ; though I am sadly afraid I should never bring 
myself to scold them." 

" I have no practical occupation," said Rowland, 
" and yet I have kept up a certain spirit." 

" I don 't call you unoccupied." 

"It is very good of you. Do you remember our 
talking about that at Northampton ? " 

"During that walk in the woods? Perfectly. Has 
your coming abroad succeeded for yourself as well as 
you hoped ? " 

" I think I may say that it has turned out as well as 
I expected." 

Are you happy ? " 

"don 't I look so?" 

"So it seems to me. But" and she hesitated a 
moment "I imagine you look happy whether you are 
so or not." 

" I am like that ancient comic mask that we saw just 
now in yonder excavated fresco ; I am made to grin." 

" Shall you come back here next winter ? " 

"Very probably." 

"Are you settled here for ever?" 

For ever is a long time. I live only from year 
to year." 

" Shall you never marry ? " 

Rowland gave a laugh. For ever never ! 
You handle large ideas. I have not taken a vow of 
celibacy." 

" Shouldn 't you like to marry ? " 

" I should like it immensely." 

To this she made no rejoinder ; but presently she 
asked, " Why don 't you write a book ? " 

Rowland laughed this time more freely. A book ! 
What book should I write ? " 

" A history ; something about art or antiquities." 

" I have neither the learning nor the talent." 



 

She made no attempt to contradict him ; she simply 
said she had supposed otherwise. You ought, at any 
rate," she continued in a moment, " to do something for 
yourself." 

" For myself? I should have supposed that if ever 
a man seemed to live for himself " 

" I don 't know how it seems," she interrupted " to 
careless observei-s. But we know we know that you 
have lived a great deal for t(s." 

Her voice trembled slightly, and she brought out the 
last words with a little jerk. 

" She has had that speech on her conscience," thought 
Rowland ; " she has been thinking she owed it to me, 
and it seemed to her that now was her time to make it 
and have done with it." 

She went on in a way which confirmed these reflec 
tions, speaking with due solemnity. " You ought to be 
made to know very well what we all feel. Mrs. Hudson 
tells me that she has told you what she feels. Of course 
Roderick has expressed himself. I have been wanting 
to thank you too ; I do, from my heart." 

Rowland made no answer ; his face at this moment 
resembled the tragic mask much more than the comic. 
But Mary was not looking at him ; she had taken up 
her eternal Murray. 

In the afternoon she usually drove with Mrs. Hudson, 
but Rowland frequently saw her again in the evening. 
He was apt to spend half an hour in the little sitting-room
