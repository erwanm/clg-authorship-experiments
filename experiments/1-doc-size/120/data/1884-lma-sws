But the sisters, Miranda and Pamela, smiled for joy, while the good
mother stopped her busy wheel to listen eagerly. Eli laid down his
fiddle and came to the hearth where the others sat, with such a
wide-awake expression on his usually thoughtful face that it was plain
that he liked the idea.

"I'll do it, if father'll let me," he said, looking wistfully at the
industrious man, who was shaving axe-handles for the winter
wood-chopping, after his day's work was over.

"Wal, I can spare you for a week, mebby. It's not time for the clock
shop yet, and sence you've heerd o' this, you won't do your chores
right, so you may as wal see what you can make of peddlin'."

"Thank you, sir; I'll give you all I get, to pay for my time," began
Eli, glowing with pleasure at the prospect of seeing a little of the
world; for one of his most cherished dreams was to cross the blue hills
that hemmed him in, and find what lay beyond.

"Guess I can afford to give you all you'll make this trip," answered his
father, in a tone that made the brothers laugh again.

"Boys, don't pester Eli. Every one hasn't a call to farmin', and it's
wal to foller the leadin's of Providence when they come along," said the
mother, stroking the smooth, brown head at her knee; for Eli always went
to her footstool with his sorrows and his joys.

So it was settled, and next day the boy, in his home-spun and home-made
Sunday best, set off to see his employer and secure the job. He got it,
and for three days trudged up and down the steep roads, calling at every
house with a sample of his book, the Rev. John Flavel's treatise on
"Keeping the Heart." Eli's winning face, modest manner, and earnest
voice served him well, and he got many names; for books were scarce in
those days, and a pious work was a treasure to many a good soul who
found it difficult to keep the heart strong and cheerful in troublous
times.

Then the books were to be delivered, and, anxious to save his small
earnings, Eli hired no horse to transport his load, but borrowed a
stout, green shawl from his mother, and, with his pack on his back,
marched bravely away to finish his task. His wages were spent in a new
prayer-book for his mother, smart handkerchief-pins for the faithful
sisters, and a good store of paper for himself.

This trip was so successful that he was seized with a strong desire to
try a more ambitious and extended one; for these glimpses of the world
showed him how much he had to learn, and how pleasantly he could pick up
knowledge in these flights.

"What be you a-brewdin' over now, boy? Gettin' ready for the clock shop?
It's 'most time for winter work, and Terry says you do pretty wal at
puttin' together," said the farmer, a day or two after the boy's return,
as they sat at dinner, all helping themselves from the large pewter
platter heaped with pork and vegetables.

"I was wishin' I could go South with Gad Upson. He's been twice with
clocks and notions, and wants a mate. Hoadley fits him out and pays him
a good share if he does well. Couldn't I go along? I hate that old shop,
and I know I can do something better than put together the insides of
cheap clocks."

Eli spoke eagerly, and gave his mother an imploring look which brought
her to second the motion at once, her consent having been already won.

The brothers stared as if Eli had proposed to go up in a balloon, for to
them the South seemed farther off than Africa does nowadays. The father
had evidently been secretly prepared, for he showed no surprise, and
merely paused a moment to look at his ambitious son with a glance in
which amusement and reproach were mingled.

"When a hen finds she's hatched a duck's egg, it's no use for her to
cackle; that ducklin' will take to the water in spite on her, and paddle
off, nobody knows where. Go ahead, boy, and when you get enough of
junketin' 'round the world, come home and fall to work."

"Then I may go?" cried Eli, upsetting his mug of cider in his
excitement.

His father nodded, being too busy eating cabbage with a wide-bladed
green-handled knife to speak just then. Eli, red and speechless with
delight and gratitude, could only sit and beam at his family till a sob
drew his attention to sister Pamela, whose pet he was.

"Don't, Pam, don't! I'll come back all right, and bring you news and all
the pretty things I can. I must go; I feel as if I couldn't breathe,
shut up here winters. I s'pose it's wicked, but I can't help it,"
whispered Eli, with his arm around his buxom eighteen-year old sister,
who laid her head on his shoulder and held him tight.

"Daughter, it's sinful to repine at the ways of Providence. I see a
leadin' plain in this, and ef I can be chirk when my dear boy is
goin', 'pears to me you ought to keep a taut rein on your feelin's, and
not spile his pleasure."

The good mother's eyes were full of tears as she spoke, but she caught
up the end of her short gown and wiped them quickly away to smile on
Eli, who thanked her with a loving look.

"It's so lonesome when he's not here. What will we do evenings without
the fiddle, or Eli to read a piece in some of his books while we spin?"
said poor Pam, ashamed of her grief, yet glad to hide her tears by
affecting to settle the long wooden bodkin that held up her coils of
brown hair.

"Obed Finch will be comin' along, I guess likely, and he'll read to you
out uv Eli's book about keepin' the heart, and you'll find your'n gone
'fore you know it," said Junius Solomon, in a tone that made pretty Pam
blush and run away, while the rest laughed at her confusion.

So it was settled, and when all was ready, the boy came home to show his
equipment before he started. A very modest outfit,--only two tin trunks
slung across the shoulders, filled with jewelry, combs, lace, essences,
and small wares.

"I hate to have ye go, son, but it's better than to be mopin' to hum,
gettin' desperut for books and rilin' father. We'll all be workin' for
ye, so be chipper and do wal. Keep steddy, and don't disgrace your
folks. The Lord bless ye, my dear boy, and hold ye in the holler of his
hand!"
