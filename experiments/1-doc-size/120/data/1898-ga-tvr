a great leap, his clumsy bulk heaving from 
side to side. But a quarter of the distance 
had been traversed when the great curves 
of the lasso sprang forward, and, amidst a 
hoarse murmur from the boys, caught the 
bull below the horns. But that was all. 
The bull would not down ! There would 
be no coliar! He merely ran on the 
brute! the beast! jerking his horns 
defiantly, putting down his head, nearly 
dragging Rafael from the saddle. But 
no ! but no ! Rafael has risen in his saddle, 
he has forced his mustang the harder, he 
is almost level with the bull he has 
passed ! He gives a great jerk, dragging 
the bull to his knees, then another, and 
the bull is on his side and rolling over and 
over down the hill, Rafael following fast, 



 

slackening his lariat. The boys now cheer 
wildly, although danger is not over yes, 
in another moment it is, and Rafael, smiling
complacently, is at the foot of the hill, 
disengaging the humbled bull. 

" Bravo ! " said a voice from behind the 
horses. All turned with a start. It was 
the priest. " Coliar was never better 
done," he added graciously; and Rafael 
felt that the day was his. 

The priest had ridden up unnoted in 
the tense excitement of the last few mo 
ments. He sat a big powerful horse, and 
his bearing was as military as that of the 
two great generals of the Californias, 
Castro and Vallejo. 

As the boys, congratulations and modest 
acknowledgement over, were making for 
home and breakfast, the priest pressed his 
horse close to Roldan's. " I interested 
you much at the race yesterday, Don 
Roldan," he said, with a good-humoured 
smile. "Why was that?" 

Roldan was not often embarrassed, but 
he was so taken aback at the abrupt sally 
he forgot to be flattered-that the priest had 



 

evidently thought it worth while to inquire 
his name ; and stammered : " I well, you 
see, my father, you are not like other 
priests." Which was not undiplomatic. 

The priest smiled, this time with a faint 
flush of unmistakable pleasure. " You are 
right, my son, I am not as other priests in 
this wilderness. Would to Heaven I were, 
or " 

" Or that you were in Spain ? " Roldan 
could not resist saying, then caught his 
breath at his temerity. 

The priest turned about and faced him 
squarely. " Yes," he said deliberately, 
" and that I were a cardinal of Rome. 
Such words I have never uttered to mortal 
before; but if I am not as other men, neither 
are you as other lads. Some day you will 
be a Castro or an Alvarado; it is written 
in your face. Perhaps something more, 
for changes may come and your oppor 
tunities be greater. But I I am no 
longer young ; there is no hope in 
California for me." 

" Why do you not return to Spain ? " 

" I have written. They will not answer. 



 

In my youth I was wild. They forced 
me to come here. I had no money. I 
was obliged to obey. I have christianised 
a few hundred worthless savages who were 
better off in their barbarism, and I have 
made myself a power among a few thou 
sand men of whom the outer world, the 
great world, knows nothing. My Mission 
is the most prosperous in the Californias 
and I " he set and ground his teeth. 
Roldan thought of the gold. "When 
I am governor of the Californias, my 
father," he said, " I shall send you back to 
Spain, for then I shall have great
influence and much o^old." 



At the last word the priest's eyes flamed 
with so fierce a light that Roldan shrank 
back repelled, feeling himself in the pres 
ence of a passion of which he had no 
knowledge. But the priest controlled him 
self at once. " Thank you, my son," he 
said with a brilliant smile. " And I do 
not ask you to guard as your own what I
