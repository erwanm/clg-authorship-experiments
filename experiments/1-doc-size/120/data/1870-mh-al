that make my hope an almost present reality. Every stitch seems to bring
nearer the fulfilment of the dear promise. I only regret that this is
the last of the set. I shall be at a loss for occupation for the next
two months. And I fear from something Herbert said to-day, that he does
not intend for me to return to Albany until the spring fairly opens. Dr.
Williams has been talking to him about my cough.”

“Dr. Williams is a fussy old woman, and Mr. Dorrance”--began Mrs.
Sutton.

Mabel quietly took up the word.

“Mr. Dorrance is ignorant of diseases and medicines, as men usually are
who have not studied these with a view to practise upon themselves or
others. I have said that he is not really uneasy; but he says, and with
truth, that the Northern March and April are raw and cold, and will try
my strength severely. Winston and Clara share in his fears. It is very
kind in them to tender me the hospitalities of their house for so long
a time, but I should feel more at home in my own, during my illness and
convalescence.”

“Why not tell your husband this plainly?”

“Because it might bias his judgment and embarrass his action. I am
willing to do as he thinks best.”

There were not many subjects upon which Mrs. Sutton was irascible, but
she patted the floor with her foot now as if this was one of them--her
discontent finding vent at length in what she regarded as a perfectly
safe query.

“Will he remain with you?”

“He cannot. His business is large and increasing. He can afford but this
one fortnight vacation.”

“How do you expect to get along without him?”

“I expect my dear old aunt to come often and see me,” said Mabel
affectionately, parrying the catechism “Clara suggested, of her own
accord, when the extension of my visit was discussed, that you should be
invited to be with me late in April--and I don’t want you to refuse.
Do you understand, and mean to be complaisant? You are all the mother I
have ever known, auntie.”

“My lamb! you need not fear lest I shall not improve every opportunity
of seeing and comforting you. I shall return a civil and grateful reply
to Mrs. Aylett’s invitation, for your sake! and for the same reason
try and remember, while I remain her guest, that her right to be and to
reign at Ridgeley is superior to yours or mine.”

The good lady was not to be harshly censured if she now and then, in
private confabulation with her favorite, let fall a remark which was the
reverse of complimentary to her niece-in-law. Mabel’s marriage was
the signal for a radical reorganization of the Ridgeley domestic
establishment, by which Mrs. Sutton was reduced from the busy,
responsible situation of housekeeper to the unenviable one of unnoticed
and unconsulted supernumerary.

“Not that I wish you to desert your old quarters, still less to feel
like a stranger with us,” said Mrs. Aylett graciously, while she
affixed shining brass labels to the keys of closets, sideboards, and
store-rooms--the keys Aunt Rachel could distinguish from one another,
and all others in the world, in the darkest night, without any labels
whatever; which had grown smooth and bright by many years’ friction of
her nimble fingers. “But Mr. Aylett wishes me to assume the real, as
well as nominal, government of the establishment”--Mrs. Aylett was fond
of the polysyllable as conveying better than any other term she could
employ the grandeur of her position as Baroness of Ridgeley. “He insists
that the servants are growing worthless and refractory under the rule of
so many. Hereafter--this is his law, not mine--hereafter, those attached
to the house department are to come to me about their orders, and the
plantation workmen to him. I shall undoubtedly have much trouble in
curing the satellites appointed to me of their irregular habits, and
reducing them to something resembling system; but Winston’s extreme
dissatisfaction with the anarchy that prevailed under the ancien regime
moves me to the undertaking.”

“They have always--for generations back, I may say--been called
excellent servants; faithful in the discharge of their duties, and
attached to their owners,” returned Mrs. Sutton tremulously. “And since
I have been in charge--ever since my dear sister’s death, I have done
my best with them, as with everything else committed by my nephew to my
care. But of course I have nothing to urge against your plan. If I can
help you in any way”---

“Thank you! You are extremely kind, my dear madam,” honeyedly. “But
I should be ashamed and sorry to be compelled to call upon you for
assistance in performing what you have done so easily and successfully
for fifteen years. I must learn confidence in my own powers, if I would
be respected by underlings. They would be quick to detect the power
behind the throne; let me hold counsel with you ever so secretly, and my
authority would be weakened by the discovery. I have not the vanity to
believe that my maiden attempt at housewifery will be attended by the
distinction that has crowned yours, but practice will perfect in this,
as in other labors. And my dear Mrs. Sutton, Mr. Aylett bids me say, in
his name, as it gives me pleasure to do in my own, that although your
occupation is gone, you are ever welcome to a home at Ridgeley, free of
all expense. It is our hope that you may still content yourself here,
even if Mabel has gone from the nest. I suppose, however, nothing will
satisfy her, when she goes to housekeeping, but having you with her as
a permanent institution. My brother intimated as much to me before his
marriage.”

Declining with mild hauteur, that gave great, but secret amusement to
her would-be benefactress, the handsome offer of a free asylum, Mrs.
Sutton went to live with a cousin of her late husband’s, whose snug
plantation was situated about twelve miles from the Aylett place, and
in the neighborhood of the Tazewells. It was a pleasant, but not a
permanent arrangement, she gave out to her numerous friends, any of whom
would have accounted themselves favored by an acceptance of a home for
life in their families.

“Ridgeley was changed and lonely since Mabel’s departure, and her own
habits were too active to be conformed to those of so small a household.
Indeed, there was nothing for her to do there any longer, so she was
glad to avail herself of Mrs. William Sutton’s invitation to stay a
while with her. The children made the house so lively. In the fall,
the house Mr. Dorrance was having built for his Southern bride would be
ready for them, and Mabel’s claim upon her aunt’s society and services
