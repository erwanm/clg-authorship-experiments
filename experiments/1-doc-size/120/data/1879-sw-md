in a good sized kettle, and be done with it." 



 

" But those Easterns are particular. They would 
lot drink coffee that had stood awhile. There is 
a man, in a light cotton dress, who attends to 
that part of the business ; and when you go in and 
sit down at first, up he comes to you with a little brass tray and a fiery coal upon it; by which 
you may light your cigar, if you do not smoke a 
Turkish pipe." 

" What's a Turkish pipe like ? " 

" Like a glass vase, part of it, which sits on the 
ground. From this vase comes the tube of the 
pipe, several feet long, with a mouth-piece of 
metal or amber or something else. It takes a 
good while to smoke one of these pipes ; and Eu 
ropeans are generally too much in a hurry. But 
the European smokes his cigar; and the waiter 
brings him his coffee, fresh made, in a tiny little 
china cup ; fragrant, and black and thick, with all 
the grounds in it." 

" All the grounds in it ! " cried grandma. " Not 
cleared ! " 

"Not cleared at all; and you drink it and you 
like it; and while you drink it, by degrees, you 
get an opportunity to look at the strange figures 
around you. When you first go in you cannot 
look much, except in stolen glances." 

"Why not, pray?" 

" It wouldn't be polite. And they are very po 
lite, the people around you. Although you are 
a stranger, and maybe the only European in the 
room, nobody stares ; indeed nobody seems to take 



 

any sjrt of notice. They are too well-bred. Anu 
of course you do not stare at them." 

"I'll engage I would, if I got a chance. I believe eyes were made to see with." 

" I would like to see what one could see in such a 
place," I repeated, remembering how Mr. Iredell had 
described to me what he saw. " For instance, grand 
ma, you might see an old gentleman in a flowered 
chintz robe, with green trowsers, and a turban on 
his head of some thin stuff striped with yellow." 

"That's a dress for an old gentleman, is it?" said 
grandma. "I would like to know what the young 
ones put on." 

"Well, one young man's dress, I remember, was 
of dark blue cloth. Very wide trowsers, ending 
in tight-fitting gaiters, which were buttoned very 
ornamentally at the side and embroidered all over, 
with cord or lace sewed on. He had a velvet vest 
ornamented in the same way ; and a loose jacket. 
Under the jacket he wore a gay silk scarf wound 
round his body ; and in his scarf one man puts his 
purse and another man sticks his dagger, just as 
it happens." 

"Who told you all that rigmarole?" 

"I told you, grandma; a gentleman I saw in 
Philadelphia." 

"What is his name?" 

" It is not a name of any of the people about here ; 
it is not a name you know." 

" Is it a name you know? that's what I ask you. 
Then I'll tell you whether I know it" 



 

"The name is Ireclell, grandma." 

"Odell," she repeated. "Do you think I never 
heard of Odells before? There's heaps of em to 
Warmington. I don't think much of em neither, 
and never did. Did he come from Warmington?" 

" I think not." 

" Most likely he did. I wouldn't have much to 
do with him, if I was you. Did you believe all 
that stuff he told you ? " 

" He said he had seen it, grandma." 

" Well there's queer things in the world, but I 
guess he put on some o that. I wish t you'd put 
on the kettle, child, and let's have tea." 

"Why, grandma, it's early yet. What do you 
want tea for?" 

"I don't know. I'd like to have it, and have 
it over." 

So I humoured her, and we had a very early 
supper; and then she went to bed early, to have 
that over too, I suppose; and I sat alone. I had 
the company of a good fire ; else all was dark and
