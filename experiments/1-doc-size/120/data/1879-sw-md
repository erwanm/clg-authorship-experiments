 April 1. 

NINE months, almost, since my last entry; and 
spring finds me with Mrs. Bowdoin. The 
winter was very busy and peaceful; looking back 
at my last writing I am ashamed of it; but I let 
it stand. It is good to know oneself. The winter 
was very peaceful, but there w r as a great deal old
sickness in the valley, and I had a great deal of 
nursing to do. I believe the first thing that really 
cured me of my morbid mental condition was the 
being forced out of myself and my own affairs by 



 

the needs of other people. Then Mrs. Bowdoin 
sent for me to take a trip to the South with her; 
she was going to Washington, and perhaps to Florida. I came two weeks ago, and found her not 
well enough to set out; and instead of growing 
better she has grown worse. So here I am in 
stalled as nurse again; and for the present with 
plenty to do; for Mrs. Bowdoin^is a sick woman. 
The doctor fears typhoid fever. 

It is a peculiar but a very positive pleasure, to 
take care of a sick person ; that is, when one has 
the power and can do it without hindrance. There 
is a constant satisfaction in ministry, when one 
knows that everything is done for the comfort and 
welfare of the person concerned, and done perfectly. In Chesterfield I am sometimes met by blind 
opposition, an opposition not to be overcome, of 
ignorance and fear; and the opening of a window, 
for instance, which would be life, is looked upon 
as certain death. Then it is hard, to do one's best, 
and yet know that the very best cannot be dime. 
But here I have it all my own way. Mrs. Bowdoin 
trusts me, the servants like me, and I rule despot 
ically in the sick room. It is so pleasant to put 
the pillows in the most comfortable position; to 
keep things looking nice; to prepare and to give 
what is to be taken, just in the best way and at 
the right time; to refresh the weary face and 
hands with bathing; to make up the fire and let 
in the sweet, health-bringing air. For the season 
is cool enough still, and we need good fires; at the 



 

same time the breath of spring is outside, and when 
I throw up the sash it meets me with a sort of 
love-greeting. It is so; I take it so. Do not all 
the Lord's works bring messages to us? This mes 
sage comes specially sweet at this time ; for I think 
of last April, and I remember the weary struggle 
of mind I went through afterwards. Now it is 
over. My old peace has come back again, firmer 
than ever. I "have known and believed the love 
that God hath to us"; and Spring seems to tell 
me of it, repeating it again and again with her 
sweet breath, every time I open the window. It 
is the only time she gets a chance, for I cannot
leave Mrs. Bowdoin long enough to take even a 
very short walk. 



Tune 1. 

I HAVE had no chance to write for many days. 
The sickness developed into what the doctor 
hfid feared, and was a very serious case. There 
was more to do every day, and every night, than 
I could do without the concentration of all my 
energies; and after the worst danger was over I 
was too weary to write. I am very weary still. 
Every two hours the medicine; every two and a 
half hours the beef tea, by day and by night, at 
the minute ; all the time the care of the fires and 
ventilation, till fires ceased to be needed, though 
the ventilation became more imperative; the daily 



 

changing of beds and linen; the daily bathing, and 
ordering of Mrs. Bowdoin's long hair; directions to 
the servants, and keeping up the supply of beef 
tea, on which so much depended; my wits were at 
full strain and my nerves, all the while. Danger 
was present for many weeks; I knew it, but I had 
good hope nevertheless; and at last the disease 
took a turn for life, and Mrs. Bowdoin began again 
to be conscious of what went on around her. And 
then, presently, she began to desire food. That 
was a joyful change, from having to almost force 
her to swallow the beef tea. It is delightful to 
prepare eatables instead of medicine ; but it keeps 
one almost as busy. However, I could throw myself down on the lounge between whiles and look 
at Mrs. Bowdoin; and she lay in her bed and looked 
at me. Talking was beyond both of us. Now, for 
some days, she has been sitting up a little while 
every day. The spring has marched on in the 
mean time, and marched off, and here is summer; 
and we have windows open sometimes for hours, 
without need of fires to keep up the temperature. 
But cold days come still between such days. 



June 20. 

THE cold days are heard of no more, and windows are open all the while. Roses are even
