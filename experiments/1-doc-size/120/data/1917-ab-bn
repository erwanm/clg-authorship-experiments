" Twenty-eight hunderd," said he. 

" Sorry," said Larry, hardening his heart and reflect- 
uig that this was only money, not nerve and muscle, and 
the man must be denied. " Can't do it for a cent less." 

" How'd it come into your hands ? " asked Neale, in a 
curiosity Larry liked, it seemed so wholesome compared 
with a barren exile in bed cursing God, no doubt, and 
craving to die. 

" He's making it over to me," he answered, " in con- 
sideration of — well, never mind. The fact is, 'Bial's 
interested in contributing to the war, and he hasn't enough 
ready money ; so he's allowing me to sell the lot for him." 

" The war? " said Neale. " Be we at war? " 

" No," said Larry, " we're neutral and godly. But 
pretty nearly all the rest of the world is, and it's godly, 
too, some of it, in a different way. Don't you get the 
war news, Neale? I should admire to read it to you." 

" She reads the papers," said Neale, " but I don't take 



 

much stock in 'em. His letters -— she reads them." 

" Hugh's letters? Hugh's a great boy. He's going 
to make us proud, some day. You know he's going back, 
to fight? " 

" He'd better stay where he is an' carry on the farm," 
said Neale. 

"He can't," said Larry, "A fellow like that can't. 
You let him go, — and read the books he'll write and 
you'll be proud." 

" I can't hinder his goin'," said Neale. " Three thou- 
sand." 

" Can't do it," said Larry. " Not a cent under thirty- 
four hundred. Of course if you haven't the money — " 

" I've got the money," said Neale, touched in his pride. 
" There's no trouble about the money. You send Pettis 
here to me an' I'll see about it," 

" All right," said Larry. He got instantly on his feet. 
" Neale," said he, " for God's sake talk to your wife. 
Don't you see how she's changed since you've been sick? 
You've got to do something about it. The rest of us 
can't. Talk to her." 

Neale did not answer. He had resumed his look at the 
door, not expectant, nothing so warm as that, but con- 
centrated on the one spot opening into an outer life. 
But when Larry's hand was on the latch, he heard a little 
sound, a click of the tongue as if Neale had to call him 
but would choose any soimd but an actual word. Larry 
turned back to him. 

" Don't — " said Neale, and then hesitated. 

" Don't tell ? " asked Larry. He had tried the man far 
enough. He felt now ashamed, ashamed of himself for 
having legs to walk with or a hand to open the door. 
"You bet I won't tell, either what you pay besides one 



 

dollar and other considerations or a word of the whole 
business. And I won't say I've seen you or that youVe 
spoken to me. But, for God's sake, Neale, speak to your 
wife." 

Then he did open the door and was gone. There was 
no one in the hall, but he heard Hugh talking to his 
mother from the room across the way, and got out of the 
front door in a cautious haste. Then it seemed to him 
he might as well run over and ask Ellen how she'd spent 
the night, and he crossed the orchard and went up the 
steps to her door. And on the upper step, with Mary 
Neale's parasol absurdly open over it, to shade it from 
the sun, he saw her little breakfast tray untouched. 
There were the rolls cooling, the coffee in its earthen 
pitcher, the cream risen to the top, the butter melted in 
the heat. Suddenly he was quick with fear, and ran up 
past the tray and knocked. 

« Ellen ! " he called. " Ellen, wake up." 

But as be did it he knew she was not there to be 
waked, and though he tried the door, that he should find 
it locked. Without more calling or knocking after that 
first involuntary summons, he ran back across the orchard 
and through the Neale house from front door to kitchen 
before he found any one. There he came on Hugh, throw- 
ing out things from the closet under the stairs in search 
of an old hat. Hugh looked up and, seeing his face, 
stood expectant. 

" What is it? " he asked. " Mother's just gone in to 
him." 

" Ellen's breakfast," said Larry. He found himself 
breathless. " It's on the step. Where is she? " 

" I put it there," said Hugh, as if the breakfast were 
the only thing to be considered.  She didn't answer and
