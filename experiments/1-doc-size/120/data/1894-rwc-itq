Presently she raised her eyes to his. 

"Shall I tell you all? I am like so many so 
many others. When you know their story, you 
know mine." 

He leaned down and kissed her. 

"Don't tell me," he said. 

But she went on. 

"I was only seventeen I am nineteen now. 
He was an officer at at Chartres, where we 
lived. He took me to Paris." 

"And left you." 

"He died of the fever in Tonquin." 

"When?" 

"Three weeks ago." 

"And you heard?" 

"To-night." 

"Then he did leave you." 

"Don t, Rex, he never loved me, and I I 
never really loved him. I found that out." 

"When did you find it out?" 

"One day, you know when, in a  cab." 

"Dear Yvonne," he whispered, "can't you go 
back to to your family?" 



 

"No, Rex." 

"Never?" 

"I don't wish, to now. No, don't ask me 
why! I can't tell you. I am like all the rest 
all the rest. The Paris fever is only cured 
by death. Don't ask me, Rex; I am content 
indeed I am." 

Suddenly a heavy rapping at the door caused 
Gethryn to spring hurriedly to his feet. 

"Rex!" 

It was Braith's voice. 

"What!" cried Gethryn, hoarsely. 

There was a pause. 

"Aren't you going to let me in?" 

"I can t, old man; I I'm not just up for company to-night," stammered Gethryn. 

"Company be damned, are you ill?" 

"No." 

There was a silence. 

"I'm sorry," began Gethryn, but was cut short 
by a gruff, 

"All right; good-night!" and Braith went 
away. 

Yvonne looked inquiringly at him. 

"It was nothing," he murmured, very pale, 



and then threw himself at her feet, crying, "Oh, 
Yvonne Yvonne !" 

Outside the storm raged furiously. 

Presently she whispered, "Rex, shall I light 
the candle? It is midnight." 

&lt;Yes," he said. 

She slipped away, and after searching for 
some time, cried, "The matches are all gone, 
but here is a piece of paper, a letter; do you 
want it? I can light it over the lamp." 

She held up an envelope to him. 

"I can light it over the lamp," she repeated. 

"What is the address" 

"It is very long, I can't read it all, only Flor 
ence, Italy. ' 

"Burn it, "he said, in a voice so low she could 
scarcely hear him. 

Presently she came over and knelt down by 
his side. Neither spoke or moved. 

"The candle is lighted," she whispered, at 
last.
