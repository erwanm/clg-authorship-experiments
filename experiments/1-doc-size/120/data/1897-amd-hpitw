" Yes ; Aunt Hannah has as good as turned me 
out. I have a little money. I shall go away it 
doesn't matter where, since I am not wanted here. 
And if I don't find friends, I can only die in the 
end," and a sob choked her. 

" Bessie ! " He could never have told who 
made the movement. He raised his arm and put 
it over her shoulder, and she seemed to drop into 
his lap, like a poor fluttering bird, giving a sigh 
of content. 

" I thought at first you liked me. It was no 
plan of mine coming here, and how should I know 
the home wasn't really Aunt Hannah's ? And I 
tried so hard to please ! I've been a little slave all 
summer. I thought maybe I had earned some 
right to a home. But I wish she had never sent 
for me. It's been nothing but pain and misery. 



 

And as for the dressmaking scheme I hate it! 
I'll kill myself first ! " 

She was sobbing softly now, and her head went 
down on his shoulder. Roy looked at her in a 
dazed fashion. She was so small and helpless. 

" I told Aunt Hannah there was no need of 
your going. She ought to have some one, and I 
am likely to be out so much now. You shall 
stay. Why, your keep wouldn't be more than 
that of a kitten, and there is an abundance of 
everything " 

Bessie made a gesture of protest, and partly 
raised her head, enough for him to see her tear- 
wet eyes and tremulous rose-red lips. 

" I have no real claim on you. Oh," with a fling 
of bitterness, "she has made me understand that! 
The home is yours. I am no kin to you ! But I 
wanted to tell you how it was, so when you come 
home some night and hear a long tale of my in 
gratitude, you will know why I couldn't stay. 
And there have been so many pleasant times 
when " 

"You must stay, child." 

" But you see, if I was your half-sister, it would 
make a world of difference ! No ; I shall just go 
off quietly 

"You shall not, Bessie." 

What did he mean to say ? Oh, heavens ! if 



 

she only were his little sister ! She was like a 
trusting baby in his arms. The sobs shook her. 
A poor, friendless, homeless little girl, too pretty 
to take a rough turn with the world. She must 
stay. He would insist to Aunt Hannah, and the 
foolish scheme of dressmaking would be given up. 

He gave a long sigh. She crept closer. Her 
warm tears fell on his hand and moved him im 
measurably. He was man enough to see how he 
could be something more to her, have the right to 
care for her. Why, three months ago he almost 
dreamed of this. What had changed him ? For 
there was some mysterious change, some new 
understanding of himself and the man he wished 
to be. When he reached that height 

The clock ticked solemnly. It seemed the turn 
ing-point of a lifetime. Pity, sympathy, the desire 
to give this eager little butterfly a pleasant life, 
the curious inward protest, and he felt himself 
pulled both ways, unable to decide. 

They did not hear the stir above them. Then a 
sharp voice called, "Bessie! Bessie!" 

She started, but clung closer to him. Her 
small hands grasped entreatingly. Her fright 
ened, pleading child's face was upraised, it moved 
nearer his, and before he was even aware of an 
impulse, he had kissed down amid the tears. 

A quick, piercing cry for help startled them. 



 

Roy put her down and ran. There was a strange 
blaze of light in the little hall, and another cry, 
this time a shriek. 

Aunt Hannah stood in Bessie's room all in a 
blaze. The curtains had burned and fallen to the 
floor. She had reached out for the quilt on the 
bed, but some kind of terror had deprived her of 
her usual presence of mind. He caught it and 
wrapped her tight as she fell to the floor. 

" Bessie, quick ! " he cried. 

But when Bessie came up, it was only to shriek 
and wring her hands. The blue and yellow 
flames were running over the fuzz of the carpet.
