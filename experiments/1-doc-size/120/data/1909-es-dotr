"The little harm has been done," Welden 
remarked. 

But that Maud could not have found her 
self quite able to concede. 

"By another," she answered, "and incompletely." 



 

In what manner the harm could have been 
completer she did not say, nor did Welden 
ask, but he marvelled at the girl, who, in 
spite of the character of their previous intimacy, now, for the first time, revealed to 
him her naked soul. 

She stood up, went to the piano and with 
one hand struck the keys into notes violent 
and discordant. 

Then, as she turned, displaying the oval 
of her perfect face, and stood there, elaborately gowned, her head erect, she might per 
haps, to any other, have presented but a 
genre picture of a society girl, ultra smart. 
To Welden she was something else, something higher or it may be, lower; a being intensely human, vibrant with elemental passion. 

"She was made for me," he told himself, 
and crossing the room, he looked her in the 
eyes. 

But however vibrant the girl may have 





been, however primitive also, she was not in 
a mood for caresses. Dumbly against him 
she felt the revolt which women have for the 
man who comes to them from the arms of 
another. Those arms were lifeless now and 
such enfoldings as they had given perhaps 
were scant, but some at least there had been, 
and at the thought of them she recoiled in 
stinctively. 

"No," she said in answer to that look. 
"Not now, perhaps never. I cannot tell. 
Do not try to ask me." 

"Good night," she added after a moment, 
when Welden, who knew better than to urge 
against her will, had taken up his hat and 
coat. 



The fatigues compressed in a journey 
across the continent are of a completeness 
that satiates the sturdiest. On leaving Madison avenue, Welden slept thirteen hours, 
awoke, tubbed, dressed, drank some coffee, 
read a telegram, also a newspaper and, other 
details terminated, drove to the Grand Central where he arranged to repeat the trip. 

The telegram, a night message from San 
ta Barbara, marked Collect and signed 
Wicks, was as follows: 

Perkins Indicted on evidence personalty obtained. 
Rings recovered, trial to-morrow. I claim rewards. 

"The imbecile," Welden muttered as the 

message fell from him. 

But the purport of it he found repeated 
in a morning paper, strung out there with 





sensational details, stories of full confession, 
others of priceless jewels the property of 
the murdered woman with whom Welden 
had eloped and then been shot by the out 
raged husband the usual farrago of fiction, 
garnished in this instance with a picture of 
White Peacocks which resembled the scene 
of the crime about as closely as it did the 
Plaza. 

Beneath the ribbon of rubbish there was 
none the less a fact. There was also a possibility. There had been an indictment, con 
viction might follow. 

The rooms which Welden occupied gave 
on Central Park. For a moment, from a 
window, he stood looking at the rain of sun 
shine, the leisurely motors, the gingerly stepping horses, the parade of nurses out with 
their charges for the midday air. Yet, though 
he looked, he did not see, or rather it was not 
the Park that he saw, but Santa Barbara 
and the obligation to return there. 



 

The prospect was not agreeable. He had, 
however, contemplated it before. Now, with 
no thought of shirking, he .contemplated it 
again. Then, the letter written, other details terminated, he went down Madison 
avenue for a word with Maud. 

But the girl was not at home. William 
assured him of that, assured him that this
