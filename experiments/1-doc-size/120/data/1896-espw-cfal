To be quite honest, I should say that I have 
not retained all the beliefs which I was taught 
who does ? But I have retained the profoundest 
respect for the way in which I was 
taught them ; and I would rather have been 
taught what I was, as I was, and run whatever 
risks were involved in the process, than to have 
been taught much less, little, or nothing. An 
excess of religious education may have its
unfortunate aspects. But a deficiency of it has 
worse. 

It is true that, for little people, our little souls 
were a good deal agitated on the question of 
eternal salvation. We were taught that heaven 
and hell followed life and death ; that the one 
place was "a desirable location," and the other x 
too dreadful to be mentioned in ears polite ; 
and that what Matthew Arnold calls " conduct " 
was the deciding thing. Not that we heard 


much, until we grew old enough to read for 
ourselves, about Matthew Arnold ; but we did 
hear a great deal about plain behavior 
unselfishness, integrity, honor, sweet temper 
the simple good morals of childhood. 

We were taught, too, to respect prayer and 
the Christian Bible. In this last particular we 
never had at all an oppressive education. 

My Sunday-school reminiscences are few and 
comfortable, and left me, chiefly, with the 
impression that Sunday-schools always studied 
Acts ; for I do not recall any lessons given me 
by strolling theologues in any other certainly 
none in any severer portions of the Bible. 

It was all very easy and pleasant, if not 
feverishly stimulating ; and I am quite willing 
to match my Andover Sunday-school experi 
ences with that of a Boston free-thinker's little 
daughter who came home and complained to 
her mother : " There is a dreadful girl put into 
our Sunday-school. I think, mamma, she is bad 
society for me. She says the Bible is
exaggerated, and then she tickles my legs ! " 

I have said that we were taught to think 
something about our own " salvation ; " and so 
we were, but not in a manner calculated to bur 
den the good spirits of any but a very sensitive 
or introspective child. Personally, I may have 
dwelt on the idea, at times, more than was good 
 

for my happiness ; but certainly no more than 
was good for my character. The idea of char 
acter was at the basis of everything we did, or 
dreamed, or learned. 

There is a scarecrow which " liberal " beliefs 
put together, hang in the field of public terror 
or ridicule, and call it Orthodoxy. Of this mis 
shapen creature we knew nothing in Andover. 

Of hell we heard sometimes, it is true, for 
Andover Seminary believed in it though, be 
it said, much more comfortably in the days 
before this iron doctrine became the bridge 
of contention in the recent serious, theological 
battle which has devastated Andover. In my 
own case, I do not remember to have been 
shocked or threatened by this woful doctrine. 
I knew that my father believed in the everlast 
ing misery of wicked people who could be good 
if they wanted to, but would not ; and I was, 
of course, accustomed to accept the beliefs of 
a parent who represented everything that was 
tender, unselfish, pure, and noble, to my mind 
in fact, who sustained to me the ideal of a 
fatherhood which gave me the best conception 
I shall ever get, in this world, of the Father 
hood of God. My father presented the interesting 
anomaly of a man holding, in one dark 
particular, a severe faith, but displaying in his 
private character rare tenderness and sweetness 

of heart. He would go out of his way to save 
a crawling thing from death, or any sentient 
thing from pain. He took more trouble to give 
comfort or to prevent distress to every breath 
ing creature that came within his reach, than 
any other person whom I have ever known. 
He had not the heart to witness heart-ache. 
It was impossible for him to endure the sight of 
a child's suffering. His sympathy was an extra 
sense, finer than eyesight, more exquisite than 
touch. Yet he did believe that absolute 
perversion of moral character went to its " own 
place," and bore the consequence of its own 
choice. 

Once I told a lie (I was seven years old), and 
my father was a broken-hearted man. He told 
me then that liars went to hell. I do not 
remember to have heard any such personal appli 
cation of the doctrine of eternal punishment 
before or since ; and the fact made a life-long 
impression, to which I largely owe a personal 
preference for veracity. Yet, to analyze the 
scene strictly, I must say that it was not fear 
of torment which so moved me ; it was the 
sight of that broken face. For my father wept 
only when death visited the household did I 
ever see him cry again and I stood melted 
and miserable before his anguish and his love. 
The devil and all his angels could not have
