The boys clapped their hands. Mr. Bradley 
stood in the doorway and the girls looked like 
culprits. 

You seem to be having no end of fun. Is it- 
anything you can share ? ” he asked. 

Oh, you never heard anything quite like it. 
It’s as good as Crambo verses, but it is all on one 
text. Oh, Miss Primrose, won’t you say your 
verse over for father? ” 

Primrose turned very red, but Mr. Bradley gave 
her such a pleasant smile that she repeated her 
nonsense. 

And making them all rhyme with the same 
word,” said Stuart. ‘‘ Dick, we must try to 
do it.” 

But we are making almost a visitation. I 
hear you two boys are to begin school next week, 
and I hope you will be good friends.” 

Oh, aren’t any of you girls going?” asked 
Dick in a tone of disappointment. 

‘‘ Well — you see, though, we are neither sugar 
nor salt to melt, we’re ‘ lasses,’ and might slop 
over,” said Prim. And we want to get used to 
the house before we try any new experiments.” 

Pretty good for you,” returned Mr. Bradley. 

Then they asked their mother to come out and 




see the playroom. She had been having a pleas- 
ant time with her new neighbors, and hoped to see 
them all at her house, and that they would be 
cordial friends. But it was getting late, and they 
must not strain their welcome the first time of 
meeting. 

“ And we shall see you in Sunday-school to- 
morrow,” Stuart said with a glance that took them 
all in. “ We like Mr. Evans so much.” 

So they said their adieus, but the boys were 
enthusiastic all the way home. 

When you want to give us a party,” began 
Dick, “ ask the Firth children over to supper. 
They are the funniest lot you ever saw, and they 
seem to have had the best of times. They’re not 
common and slangy, and some of them are real 
pretty. Chan has the loveliest eyes, and Primrose 
would keep you laughing half the time. The 
girls are named after flowers.” 

We have had a most agreeable call. I must 
say Mr. Mann is a fine, straightforward person. 
The children will have a most excellent father. 
Eight of them, think! He has some admirable 
ideas concerning children, and a heart overflowing 
with love for them. Then Mrs. Mann is quite 
above the average country women. You heard 
her say she taught school for several years ? ” 




And she is so unpretentious. Some people 
would not have borne the transplanting as well.” 

The children were very enthusiastic also. Then 
Mr. Jones and his man brought in the remaining 
boards and cleared away the debris. 

You better put all this out of harm’s way,” 
he said to Mr. Mann. any one dropped a 

match there would be a great blaze. I’d have it 
carted up in the snow.” 

A good thought. I’ll set Dan about it.” 

The twins returned in a high state of delight; 
but as soon as supper was over they wanted to go 
to bed, the fresh air had made them so drowsy. 

Sunday was a very fair day, and Mr. and Mrs. 
Mann, Amaryllis and Linn, went to church. They 
had several very kindly greetings. And in the 
afternoon there were five new Sunday-school 
scholars. Ready as the children were on their 
own ground, they were a trifle diffident here, but 
the Bradley boys introduced them with friendly 
warmth. 

And on Monday Mr. Mann took his two boys 
over to Ridgewood, and had a very satisfactory 
interview with the principal. He had tried to 
discourage Mrs. Mann’s plan of teaching the girls, 
but she thought it would be better for Rilla, and 
it would not do to send the younger ones alone. 




Linn found a good sponsor in Richard Brad- 
ley. Stuart was in the graduating class, and 
would enter the high school in the coming 
autumn. Linn was used to making his way with 
boys, and had learned to stand his ground when 
the old fellows that hung around the store chaffed 
him, or the women haggled for better measure and
