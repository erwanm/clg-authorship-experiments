can’t come to my party. I like Linn ever so 
much. And Mr. Evans thinks Chandler may 
make a mint of money by and by with his 
voice,” 




Then they reached their next calling-place, and 
Cassie made much of their interview at the 
Manns’. 

Rilla went out to the dining-room, where Mrs. 
Alden sat crocheting a bead purse, and told her of 
the visit. 

I think I wouldn’t have wanted to go. I 
shouldn’t know what girls did at real nice parties. 
And I wonder if I ought to have called you in 
mother’s place — you see, I don’t just know Graf- 
ton manners,” with a faint laugh. 

No, dear. It was your call with your friends, 
and there was no question to decide. I think you 
did very well.” 

Then Amaryllis went to the piano. She was 
getting over her fright a little, and beginning to 
use her fingers quite easily. 

After dinner they sat round the library-table 
reading and studying. They generally took an 
hour in Chan’s room for this purpose, but it didn’t 
seem quite the thing to leave the others. Rhoda 
studied over by the corner. Laurel’s rag doll had 
been clothed again. 

Dan brought in four post-cards that had come 
in the last mail. The travelers had reached Phila- 
delphia at four on Monday, had settled themselves 
at a pleasant hotel, and gone to a fine concert in 




the evening. The next morning they had spent 
doing the city, and there news had to stop. 

Laurel was talking in a low tone. 

“ Muver’s gone away, Dolly, to Philly some- 
thin’. It’s a hard word and I can’t say it. There’s 
a big bell and she and father are going to ring it, 
only we can’t hear, it’s so far, far away, like 
' happy land.’ I’m getting real plain in my talk, 
Dolly, so’s you can mistand, ’cause bimeby I’m 
goin’ to school. You can’t go ’cause you don’t 
know how to talk yet, but I didn’t when I was lit- 
tle like you. And Christmas Doll can talk, only 
dest say two talks ’n’ then you must pull a string. 
An’ I love you best ’cause I’ve had you many 
hundred years.” 

Linn and Prim glanced up with a funny light 
in their eyes, but would not laugh aloud. Goldie 
had found a new industry. Mrs. Alden had 
taught her to crochet, and she was deeply inter- 
ested in the possibilities opening before her. 

It doesn’t seem quite right without mother,” 
said Chan when the twins had gone to bed. 

“ Well, no, it isn’t right, but — but it is best just 
now,” returned Prim. “ And we haven’t groaned. 
I’m reading up about Philadelphia. In the early 
days people hollowed out caves and lived in them.” 

Nonsense ! ” 


“ It’s a fact.” Prim found a book and read 
aloud. 

“ And some people lived in caves out in Arizona, 
but they died long ago.” 

“ Which proves cave-dwelling is dangerous,” 
commented Marigold sententiously. 

“ Come, let’s go to bed,” said Linn, “ and rise 
with the lark in the morning.” 

Oh, do you suppose there will be robins and 
bluebirds and thrushes over here?” asked Mari- 
gold. “ Chan, do you remember how we used to 
sing their songs ? ” 

‘‘ That’s what little Arthur liked so much. I 
couldn’t do it as well without you. But I’ve 
grown fond of beautiful words. Oh, I am learn- 
ing such a glorious sort of anthem. Mr. Evans is 
teaching me, and he wants me to sing it at Easter. 
I let it float through my brain as I am going to 
sleep.” 

Then they put up their books and kissed each 
other good-night. Two days had gone and Tip 
hadn’t cried. 


CHAPTER XIV 


THE COURAGE OF ENDEAVOR 

“ I NEVER cried a word last night/’ announced 
Tip at the breakfast-table. 

Good boy ! And no bear came to disturb your 
slumbers,” laughed Chan.
