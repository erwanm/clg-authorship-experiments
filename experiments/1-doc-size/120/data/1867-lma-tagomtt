so energetically that the holly berries came rolling over her white
shoulders.

“We are not as rich as we might be, and must establish ourselves as soon
and as well as possible. I intend to be Lady Treherne. You can be the
Honorable Mrs. Annon, if you give your mind to it.”

“My dear child, are you mad?” whispered Blanche.

“Far from it, but you will be if you waste your time on Maurice. He is
poor, and a cripple, though very charming, I admit. He loves Tavie, and
she will marry him, I am sure. She can’t endure Frank, but tries to
because my lady commands it. Nothing will come of it, so try your
fascinations and comfort the poor man; sympathy now will foster love
hereafter.”

“Don’t talk so here, Rose, someone will hear us,” began her sister, but
the other broke in briskly.

“No fear, a crowd is the best place for secrets. Now remember what I
say, and make your game while the ball is rolling. Other people are
careful not to put their plans into words, but I’m no hypocrite, and say
plainly what I mean. Bear my sage counsel in mind and act wisely. Now
come and begin.”

Treherne was sitting alone by one of the great fires, regarding the gay
scene with serious air. For him there was neither dancing nor games; he
could only roam about catching glimpses of forbidden pleasures,
impossible delights, and youthful hopes forever lost to him. Sad but not
morose was his face, and to Octavia it was a mute reproach which she
could not long resist. Coming up as if to warm herself, she spoke to him
in her usually frank and friendly way, and felt her heart beat fast when
she saw how swift a change her cordial manner wrought in him.

“How pretty your holly is! Do you remember how we used to go and gather
it for festivals like this, when we were happy children?” he asked,
looking up at her with eyes full of tender admiration.

“Yes, I remember. Everyone wears it tonight as a badge, but you have
none. Let me get you a bit, I like to have you one of us in all things.”

She leaned forward to break a green sprig from the branch over the
chimneypiece; the strong draft drew in her fleecy skirt, and in an
instant she was enveloped in flames.

“Maurice, save me, help me!” cried a voice of fear and agony, and
before anyone could reach her, before he himself knew how the deed was
done, Treherne had thrown himself from his chair, wrapped the tiger
skin tightly about her, and knelt there clasping her in his arms
heedless of fire, pain, or the incoherent expressions of love that
broke from his lips.




Chapter VI


MIRACLES

Great was the confusion and alarm which reigned for many minutes, but
when the panic subsided two miracles appeared. Octavia was entirely
uninjured, and Treherne was standing on his feet, a thing which for
months he had not done without crutches. In the excitement of the
moment, no one observed the wonder; all were crowding about the girl,
who, pale and breathless but now self-possessed, was the first to
exclaim, pointing to her cousin, who had drawn himself up, with the
help of his chair, and leaned there smiling, with a face full of
intense delight.

“Look at Maurice! Oh, Jasper, help him or he’ll fall!”

Sir Jasper sprung to his side and put a strong arm about him, while a
chorus of wonder, sympathy, and congratulations rose about them.

“Why, lad, what does it mean? Have you been deceiving us all this
time?” cried Jasper, as Treherne leaned on him, looking exhausted but
truly happy.

“It means that I am not to be a cripple all my life; that they did not
deceive me when they said a sudden shock might electrify me with a more
potent magnetism than any they could apply. It has, and if I am cured
I owe it all to you, Octavia.”

He stretched his hands to her with a gesture of such passionate
gratitude that the girl covered her face to hide its traitorous
tenderness, and my lady went to him, saying brokenly, as she embraced
him with maternal warmth, “God bless you for this act, Maurice, and
reward you with a perfect cure. To you I owe the lives of both my
children; how can I thank you as I ought?”

“I dare not tell you yet,” he whispered eagerly, then added, “I am
growing faint, Aunt. Get me away before I make a scene.”

This hint recalled my lady to her usual state of dignified
self-possession. Bidding Jasper and the major help Treherne to his room
without delay, she begged Rose to comfort her sister, who was sobbing
hysterically, and as they all obeyed her, she led her daughter away to
her own apartment, for the festivities of the evening were at an end.

At the same time Mrs. Snowdon and Annon bade my lady good-night, as if
they also were about to retire, but as they reached the door of the
gallery Mrs. Snowdon paused and beckoned Annon back. They were alone
now, and, standing before the fire which had so nearly made that
Christmas Eve a tragical one, she turned to him with a face full of
interest and sympathy as she said, nodding toward the blackened shreds
of Octavia’s dress, and the scorched tiger skin which still lay at their
feet, “That was both a fortunate and an unfortunate little affair, but I
fear Maurice’s gain will be your loss. Pardon my frankness for Octavia’s
sake; she is a fine creature, and I long to see her given to one worthy
of her. I am a woman to read faces quickly; I know that your suit does
not prosper as you would have it, and I desire to help you. May I?”

“Indeed you may, and command any service of me in return. But to what do
I owe this unexpected friendliness?” cried Annon, both grateful and
surprised.

“To my regard for the young lady, my wish to save her from an
unworthy man.”
