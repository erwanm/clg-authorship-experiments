who did ! '' 

She could think of some one in whose story she 
was deeply interested. How could she, in turn, 
interest Sabrina? 





It came into Miss Eastwood's mind that here 
might be the beginning of a charity, with Pearl 
at its head. 

" We can talk it over when I come back ; " she 
could not in a moment formulate a plan. " Stay 
as long as you can ; shelter whoever you will. I 
couldn't do anything half so worthy with it. I feel 
poor in the ways of comfort that you give with 
exquisite sympathy. I must study to gain the 
ability to plan for the benefit of others. I want 
you to have the power to carry out your aims and 
plans." 

She bent and kissed her with tenderness. Was 
her dream taking definite shape.? Pearl and an- 
other in this old place, making a blessed centre 
for the new town ; for poor souls brought from 
the over-crowded marts, and trained in wholesome, 
thrifty ways ; little children coming to know 
what green fields and flowers and the singing of 
birds really meant. She had listened with deep 
interest to Olmstead's plans of social regeneration. 
He and Pearl would be a moving power in the 
world. She must not look at these lives with 
any secret envy. 

"I am tired," Sabrina said presently. "You 
will not mind if I say good-night." 

Pearl Disbrowe half listened to the music, half 
followed her own thoughts. There had been 





something to- say, and she had not said it. She 
had become interested in Hollis Winchester's mis- 
fortunes and his love for the old place. 
Olmstead had told her most of the story, leaving out 
the protest made about the summer's experiment ; 
how he had pleaded in his delirium to be taken 
back to the home of his childhood ; how he remem- 
bered every nook, the old flower garden,- the fields 
and groves, and his mother's love !" 

If these two people could be brought together, 
and the bitterness between them be softened and 
disappear ! If Sabrina only knew the truth ! 
Pearl could not think of her as implacable, nor 
having a regard for her mother's wishes that would 
savor of vindictivehess. Neither could she realize 
all the long years of waiting that had made Mrs. 
Eastwood so bitter, and the late justice that had 
hardened her soul instead of softening it. 







CHAPTER XIV 

THE TARES AND THE WHEAT 

Mrs. Vantine inspected her charge critically. 
She considered herself responsible for Sabrina 
Eastwood's physical well-being and her good looks 
until they should be safely delivered to the care of 
a husband! She felt a little indignant that her 
missives should not have been answered at once; 
and she had settled to the fact that Sabrina had 
ruined her complexion, or " gone off " in some 
dreadful manner. She held her at arm's length 
after the greeting. Sabrina's figure still showed 
its subtle, sinuous lines ; her face had lost none of 
its high-bred calm, and her complexion was fault- 
less. There was an indescribable charm for which 
Mrs. Vantine could find no adjective. 

" I've hardly had a comfortable moment about 
you the last week," she began. " I had a misgiv- 
ing that something dreadful had happened to you. 
But you are radiant ! You don't look a day over 
nineteen. I am not sure but you ought to have a 
coming-out tea. Well, it is a very great relief." 




Mrs. Vantine pulled out her frills and gave her 
head a toss of complacency. " But what have you 
been doing ? " she added. 

" I took a little journey with Mrs. Herrick and 
her niece, and only returned last evening. For 
the rest — I have been simply idling." 

" Well, you were wise. The journey was fear- 
ful. And now you are fresh as a rose. There's 
an invitation to the Craythorpes for a week, to 
meet some English people who once saw us — I 
have forgotten where — and to Newport. But you 
haven't a decent thing to wear, I dare say." 

Sabrina laughed carelessly. ' 

" Well, we must see about something at once.
