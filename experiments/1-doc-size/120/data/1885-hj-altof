rounded with other tall houses, and occupied on one 
side by the theatre, a pompous building, decorated 
with columns and statues of the muses. Nantes be 
longs to the class of towns which are always spoken 
of as "fine," and its position near the mouth of the 
Loire gives it, I believe, much commercial movement. 
It is a spacious, rather regular city, looking, in the 
parts that I traversed, neither very fresh nor very 
venerable. It derives its principal character from the 
handsome quays on the Loire, which are overhung 
with tall eighteenth-century houses (very numerous, 
too, in the other streets), houses with big entresols 
marked by arched windows, classic pediments, balcony- 
rails of fine old iron-work. These features exist in 
still better form at Bordeaux; but, putting Bordeaux 
aside, Nantes is quite architectural. The view up and 
down the quays has the cool, neutral tone of color 
that one finds so often in French water-side places, 
the bright grayness which is the tone of French land 
scape art. The whole city has rather a grand, or at 
least an eminently well-established air. During a day 
passed in it of course I had time to go to the Musee; 
the more so that I have a weakness for provincial 
museums, a sentiment that depends but little on the 
quality of the collection. The pictures may be bad, 
but the place is often curious; and, indeed, from bad 
pictures, in certain moods of the mind, there is a 



degree of entertainment to be derived. If they are 
tolerably old, they are often touching; but they must 
have a relative antiquity, for I confess I can do no 
thing with works of art of which the badness is of 
recent origin. The cool, still, empty chambers in 
which indifferent collections are apt to be preserved, 
the red brick tiles, the diffused light, the musty odor, 
the mementos around you of dead fashions, the snuffy 
custodian in a black skull cap, who pulls aside a 
faded curtain to show you the lustreless gem of the 
museum, these things have a mild historical quality, 
and the sallow canvases after all illustrate something. 
Many of those in the museum of Nantes illustrate the 
taste of a successful warrior; having been bequeathed 
to the city by Napoleon 's marshal, Clarke (created 
Due de Feltre). In addition to these there is the 
usual number of specimens of the contemporary French 
school, culled from the annual Salons and presented 
to the museum by the State. Wherever the traveller 
goes, in France, he is reminded of this very honorable 
practice, the purchase by the Government of a cer 
tain number of "pictures of the year," which are pre 
sently distributed in the provinces. Governments suc 
ceed each other and bid for success by different 
devices; but the "patronage of art" is a plank, as we 
should say here, in every platform. The works of art 
are often ill-selected, there is an official taste which 
you immediately recognize, but the custom is essen 
tially liberal, and a government which should neglect 
it would be felt to be painfully common. The only 




thing in this particular Musee that I remember is a 
fine portrait of a woman, by Ingres, very flat and 
Chinese, but with an interest of line and a great deal 
of style. 

There is a castle at Nantes which resembles in 
some degree that of Angers, *but has, without, much 
less of the impressiveness of great size, and, within, 
much more interest of detail. The court contains the 
remains of a very fine piece of late Gothic, a tall ele 
gant building of the sixteenth century. The chateau 
is naturally not wanting in history. It was the residence 
of the old Dukes of Brittany, and was brought, with 
the rest of the province, by the Duchess Anne, the last 
representative of that race, as her dowry, to Charles 
VIII. I read in the excellent hand-book of M. Joanne 
that it has been visited by almost every one of the 
kings of France, from Louis XL downward; and also 
that it has served as a place of sojourn less voluntary 
on the part of various other distinguished persons, 
from the horrible Marechal de Retz, who in the fifteenth 
century was executed at Nantes for the murder of a 
couple of hundred young children, sacrificed in abomin 
able rites, to the ardent Duchess of Berry, mother of 
the Count of Chambord, who was confined there for a 
few hours in 1832, just after her arrest in a neigh 
boring house. I looked at the house in question you 
may see it from the platform in front of the chateau 
and tried to figure to myself that embarrassing scene. 
The duchess, after having unsuccessfully raised the 
standard of revolt (for the exiled Bourbons), in the 


legitimist Bretagne, and being "wanted," as the phrase 
is, by the police of Louis Philippe, had hidden herself 
in a small but loyal house at Nantes, where, at the end 
of five months of seclusion, she was betrayed, for gold, 
to the austere M. Guizot, by one of her servants, an 
Alsatian Jew named Deutz. For many hours before 
her capture she had been compressed into an inter 
stice behind a fireplace, and by the time she was 
drawn forth into the light she had been ominously 
scorched. The man who showed me the castle in 
dicated also another historic spot, a house with little 
tourelles, on the Quai de la Fosse, in which Henry IV. 
is said to have signed the Edict of Nantes. I am, 
however, not in a position to answer for this pedigree. 
There is another point in the history of the fine 
old houses which command the Loire, of which, I sup 
pose, one may be tolerably sure; that is, their having, 
placid as they stand there to-day, looked down on the 
horrors of the Terror of 1793, the bloody reign of the 
monster Carrier and his infamous noyades. The most 
hideous episode of the Revolution was enacted at 
Nantes, where hundreds of men and women, tied to 
gether in couples, were set afloat upon rafts and sunk
