that Clement and Rose have so planned that it will alwaya 
be here." 

" Dear Clement," said the mother, fondly. " And yet 
each one of you has borne the burden and heat of the day. 
I cannot tell you, my dear children, how doubly sweet 
your sympathy and assistance have been. Amid the losses 
and perplexities, each one has won something for this 
%nd I trust for the life to come." 




" Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy does come in 
the morning, some morning when we are not looking 
for it," said Jessie. " And it has come blessedly to us." 

"Yes," returned Philip. "Our gains have not been 
small. God has given us beauty for ashes, and the oil of 
joy for mourning. I sometimes look over the path by which 
we have been led, and its lessons sink deeply into my soul, 
We have learned that no wrong or thoughtless act stops 
between God and our own conscience, but bears its fatal 
fruit wide spread." 

"And causes misery to many innocent souls," said Madge. 
" It is not true that he who sins always bears the heaviest 
punishment." 

" It seems to me that God desires to teach us by this 
one indisputable fact, that humanity is linked together 
from this brief life to the far-reaching one that is to come 
after, and that while we make any compromise with wrong, 
we are rendered just that far incapable of decisions which 
are pure and honest." 

"And yet it does seem hard to suffer from the faults of 
others. I cannot make out how far any one has a right;" 
and Madge paused, one of the old troubled looks crossing 
her face. 

" My dear," said her mother, " we are not asked to make 
it out. We puzzle our heads over judgments and punish- 
ments as if we could find out all of God's ways, when He 
simply asks us to bear something for His sake, to prove 
our love and devotion. He, being innocent, suffered for the 
many, and I think, besides the grand doctrine of the atone- 
ment, it was to teach us that lesson, also. Wherein we 
Lave suffered innocently, we have followed a little in His 
footsteps." 

"I had not thought of that." 

" And we become the more careful of our own actions. 
Every relation of life has its own responsibility. We may 
hurt and hinder others through some selfish aggrandize- 
ment of our purposes that may look fair enough to our- 



 

selves from the outside. But we are to go deeper than 
that. We are to sift our motives. For He reads those." 

" And to learn that charity comes to mean, in daily life, 
a wise, tender, and generous forbearance, a helpful heart 
and ready hand; that holiness is no mystic, far-fetched 
quality, but an ever-living power, penetrating both soul 
and body, bringing humility, righteousness, and faith in 
its train. For close to us all is this living presence of God. 
We have only to reach out and take." 

" But you have so much faith, Philip. You see things 
so clearly !" 

" I have left the darkness behind ! I remember the day 
I enlisted. I said, I am here to do whatever God wills. If 
He open no other door, I will walk in this path, fulfilling its 
duties to the uttermost. And when He set my feet on 
high, how could I help but believe and trust?" 

" And my happiness came through that," said Jessie 
with a sound of tremulous joy in her voice. 

They thought of another cloud that had brought ik, 
silver lining to the day. No one remembered it now with 
:my sense of wrong. Rose's tenderness would have shamed 
them all if they had. 

"And we have learned that duties and blessings abound 
in the lowly paths of life as well as the loftiest," said Mrs. 
Ashburton ; " that brothers and sisters, parents and chil- 
dren, can bring forth good fruit in the simplest of daily 
work. And you, my children, have done this. It is not 
only high heroic deeds that bring a sweet reward. And 
when we comprehend how really grand a thing it is to 
live, we desire to give back to God the fruit of our prog- 
ress, our growth in the graces of spiritual life. And now, 
my darlings, good night." 

"I shall often miss the dear old home," said Philip, lin- 
gering at the door. " But I know that I shall keep my place 
in your hearts, and one of my happiest thoughts will be the 
reunions to come." 





On the morrow they said farewell to him. What a 
manly soul his was ! Truth and honor were ineffaceably 
stamped on his countenance. There would be no weak 
shipwrecks for him. He had been tried already " as by 
fire." 

Then Jessie began her preparations. A few trunks and 
boxes to be packed, for the furniture was to remain, 
part for Madge, and the rest for her mother. After she 
was fairly settled, Mr. and Mrs. Ashburton were to pay her
