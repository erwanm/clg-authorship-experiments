There was an eagerness in John's manner that showed 
how strongly the idea was taking hold of him. 

'' I do not believe that your father, on reflection, will 
object," said Mrs. Guy. 

" Will you ask him about it ? " 

" Yes. And I think you'd better leave the matter 
entirely in my hands. And, first, let me caution you 
not to say anything on the subject to Adam. He has 
considerable influence with your father, and would be 
sure to oppose, if only for the sake of opposition." 

" Oh, I understand that ! He'd thwart me out of 
sheer malignancy." 

Mrs. Guy did not throw in a mollifying word. It 
was no part of her mission in the family to harmonize 
or conciliate. 

" I will manage him," she said, in the tone of one 
who felt her power ; " only, as I suggested, keep your 
own counsel. You shall go as supercargo in the Ariel 
if you desire it." 

" I do desire it above all things," replied John, " and 
if you will get father's consent, I'll remember you as 
long as I live." 

" There is one thing I would suggest, as your father 
will have to be managed a little in the beginning," said 
Mrs. Guy, lowering her voice in a confidential way, 
and speaking with an unusual familiarity, " and that is, 
an assumption of indifference on your part. This in 
difference, may have to take the form of opposition be 
fore all is settled ; but, I will give you the right hint at 
the right time. You understand?" 


" Perfectly." 

u It wont strike him favorably on the first blush ; 
but I'll engage to bring him over to our way of think 
ing. It will be a splendid chance to see the world and 
improve yourself, and when he understands this there 
will be no more trouble." 

Mrs. Guy lost no time, for the Ariel was already 
taking in cargo, and would be ready for sea in less than 
two weeks. 

" This idle life that John is leading, troubles me con 
tinually," said Mrs. Guy, thus opening the subject, on 
the next occasion of being alone with her husband. 
" It will be his destruction, I fear." 

A shade of anxiety passed over Mr. Guy's face, but 
he did not respond. 

" Is there nothing that we can do with him ? " 

Mr. Guy shook his head. 

" He'll be ruined if left to his own will hopelessly 
ruined." 

The voice of Mrs. Guy was full of concern. Still ? 
her husband made no answer. 

" How would it do to send him out as supercargo in 
one of your vessels ? " 

" It wouldn't do at all," was Mr. Guy's quick answer. 

" I'm not so sure of that," said his wife, who had 
expected just this answer. " If he could be induced to 
go, it might be his salvation." 

" Do you suppose we'd trust a boy like him with the 
disposal of a cargo ? What does he know of business ? " 

" Of course," answered Mrs. Guy, not in the least 
disconcerted, " you would send him with an experienced 



 

captain, who would be the real man. The end is to 
save the boy ; to get him away from the temptations 
that now beset him on every hand. As to his control 
of the cargo, that is another thing. He might sail 
under the idea of full powers, while the captain had 
orders to supersede him on the ship's arrival out. Don't 
you see, how safely this might be done ? My only fear 
is, that John may not consent." 

" He will not ; on that you may rest assured," said 
Mr. Guy. 

" If he were to consent what then ? How does 
the thing strike you, on reflection ? " 

" Anything to get him away from the dangers of this 
city." 

" So I think. Turn it over in your thought, Mr. 
Guy. How in regard to the captain of the Ariel ? 
Is he a discreet man ? " 

" He is a good captain," was replied. 

" Does he need a supercargo ? " 

" No. The ship will be consigned to a house in 
Valparaiso." 

" So much the better. John's position as supercargo 
would give no control whatever, and might be so ar
