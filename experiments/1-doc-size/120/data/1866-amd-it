himself with attempts at driving. Presently they reached a 
large country-house, whose numerous additions were more 
suggestive of comfort than architectural beauty. Two bois- 
terous cousins nearly smothered Archie and Lily with kisses. 
Aunt Sophy led the way up stairs to a spacious apartment, 
whose white curtains, checked matting, and maple chairs 
looked cool and inviting. 

" This is the best I can do for you," she exclaimed, 
glancing at Mabel. " Lily must share Dora's room, and 
Tom can take Archie in charge. I've been crowded with 
boarders this summer, but I've kept this room in spite of 
all. Now I'll go and send your trunk up. Wouldn't you 
like to have supper here this first night ? " 

" A very delightful proposal. But think of the trouble." 

She answered Richard's look with a laugh. " Trouble ! 
No, indeed. I'm only too glad to have you all down here ; " 
and she bustled off in her cheery fashion. 

Mabel refreshed herself and the children with a plentiful 
ablution, and by the time she had them all in order, aunt 
Sophy reappeared with the tea-tray. Lily gayly proceeded 
to arrange the table. Such nice creamy biscuits, such dishes 
of fruit, and for Tessy a little broiled bird. Aunt Sophy 
took the head of the table, and soon made them all feel at 
home. Her warm heart and cordial manner were wonder- 
fully enjoyable. 

The next morning Richard left them, though not without 
many charges -concerning Tessy and the two others, who 
seemed disposed to run wild. 

" Never you mind," said aunt Sophy. " I've managed 
them many a time before. As for Tessy, she'll be so plump 
and rosy on your return that you will hardly know her. 
And now, little ones, kiss brother Dick good by, and come 
down to the kitchen with me." 






After his duty was fairly performed, and no pleading eyea 
met his at every turn, Richard was all impatience. Delay 
and disappointment had strengthened his desire for Ada. 
Now that he had a right to shut out every other thought, he 
was almost surprised to find her so dear, so well beloved. 

The party had gone to Newport. It was late in the after- 
noon when he arrived, and just allowing himself time for 
the briefest toilet, he hurried down to the spacious hotel 
parlor. Summoning a servant, he despatched him with a 
message for Miss Townley. 

The reply was that Miss Townley had gone out, but Mrs. 
Taylor would be down presently. 

Ada had not received his letter, then, or she would surely 
have been the first to greet him. He paced impatiently up 
and down the room, glanced at the gay groups among the 
shrubbery, and found it hard work to restrain himself. 
After what seemed to him an interminable while, Mrs. Tay- 
lor entered, and greeted him cordially, yet with perceptible 
constraint. 

" I am so sorry Ada is out ; but Mrs. Ashley was anxious 
for some sea-coast views, and the day was so fine for visiting 
them, they thought it best not to wait." 

" Do you know if she heard from me this morning ? " 

" I was out until nearly noon. I do not think she ex- 
pected you to-day," was Mrs. Taylor's non-committal reply. 

It was some comfort for Richard to believe tnfc mails at 
fault. He walked up and down the balcony with Mrs. Tay- 
lor, and as the best means of quieting his mind, related the 
events of the last few weeks, and questioned her concerning 
their White Mountain trip. Then Mr. Ashley came saun- 
tering towards them, and Richard's first eager question was, 
" Where did you leave the ladies ? " 

" Me ? O, I have not seen them since about four. They 
have quite deserted me, I assure you ; won by a fast horse ; " 
and Mr. Ashley laughed with the easy grace of a man of the 
world. 



 

"Mr. Livingston, an old friend, has taken them out," 
explained Mrs. Taylor. 

Richard's disappointment deepened almost to disapproval. 

"Don't look so sober, doctor," began Mr. Ashley. 
" When you see those magnificent grays, you will not won- 
der. Everybody is frantic about Livingston's turn-out, 
especially the women." 

At this juncture the supper bell rang. " Since we have 
to play the roll of the deserted, we may as well do it with a 
good grace," said Mr. Ashley, gayly. " Accept my arm, 
Mary. Come, doctor." 

" Perhaps we had better wait," suggested Mrs. Taylor, as 
she noticed the expression of Richard's face. 

" Nonsense. You remember Mr. Livingston's description 
of the beach by moonlight, and Ada's saying the only time 
to ride there was after sundown. They will not be back 
these three hours. Don't look so disconsolate, doctor ; this 
Newport bewitches the women." 

Richard followed them reluctantly, wondering if there 
could ever come a time when he would be so indifferent to
