' I declare, Mrs. Hartley," said the latter, " it is 
a shame to keep that girl back as you do. " It is 
unjust to her. She would shine in company." 



 

" I have no wish to see her shine. To attract 
much attention is always to be in a dangerous po- 
sition for one so young and inexperienced. Be- 
sides, when she does shine, as you say, I wish it 
to be with a steady and enduring light — not with 
flickering glare, dazzling but evanescent. Next 
winter we intend taking her into company for a 
few times, and, after that, introducing her to a more 
extended but select circle of acquaintances. What 
we wish most to guard against, is the danger of 
her forming an attachment too early. We wish 
her heart to be free until her reason is matured, 
and her judgment formed upon a basis of true prin- 
ciples. If you expose a young girl in fashionable 
society to the love-gossip so prevalent there among 
certain portions of it, you injure her almost inevi- 
tably. If she even make a good marriage after- 
wards, it will be little more than a happy accident." 

" I cannot understand why." 

" The fact is notorious. A good husband is one 
who marries from correct views of marriage \ and 
he will take good care that his wife is not one of 
the puppet- women with whom he has chattered 
and gossipped in the fashionable drawing-room. 
O no! He must have more sober and enduring 
qualities. The wife and mother, the nurse in sick- 
ness, the companion of a whole life will never be 



 

c}io?en by a sensible man from one of these. He 
will see in the quiet, thoughtful maiden, charms 
more potent, and at her shrine will he ofTer up the 
pure devotion of an honest heart." 

Mrs. Hartley's visiter did not feel very well 
pleased with herself or her daughter for some days 
after this conversation. There was so nmch of 
truth about what had been said, and truth bearing 
upon her own conduct as a mother, that it made 
her uncomfortable. But it was too late for her to 
mend — the evil was already done. The more she 
thought about the picture Mrs. Hartley had drawn 
of a puppet- woman, as she had chosen to call her, 
the more closely did she perceive that her own 
daughter resembled the sketch, until she felt half 
angry at what appeared almost too pointed an 
allusion. 

The next time that Mrs. Fielding and daughter 
called upon Mrs. Hartley, the latter paid a much 
more respectful attention to Marien than she had 
ever before done. She was surprised to find, in one 
she had looked upon as a gu'l too young for her 
to associate with, a quiet dignity of manner and 
womanly tone of character beyond what she had 
dreamed existed. At first she rattled on with her 
in quite a patronizing way, but before she left, she 
was rather inclined to listen than to talk. 



 

''While our mammas are talking, let us have 
some music," Jane said, during a pause in the con- 
versation. " Are you fond of playing ?" 

" I am fond of music, and always like good 
playing. Come to the piano — you play well, I 
understand. I shall enjoy your performance very 
much." 

Jane sat down to the piano, and rattled off seve- 
ral fashioiable frivolities, in a kind of hap-hazard 
style. Iarien was disappointed, and did not, for 
she could not, praise the young lady's playing. 
She had learned only to speak what she thought, 
and when she could not praise, and utter the truth, 
she said nothing. 

'' Play something else," she said. 

Jane turned over the music books and selected 
an overture that required a brilliant performer to 
execute it with any thing like its true effect. On 
this she went to work, with might and main, and 
got through in about ten minutes, much to the re- 
lief of Marien, whose line perception of musical 
harmonies was terribly outraged. 

"Now you must play," said Jane, as she struck 
the last note, rising from the instrument. 

Marien sat down and let her fingers fall upon the 
keys, that answered to their touch as if half con- 
scious. 



 

" Yon play divinely !" exclaimed Jane, after 
Marien had played a short piece of music with fine 
taste. "Do you sing.?" 

" Sometimes."
