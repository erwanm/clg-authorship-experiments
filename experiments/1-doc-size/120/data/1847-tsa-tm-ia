good. Nothing more will be done. But if not, 
our next course will be to attend regularly at six 
for a week, and scrape the chaplain down." 

"What!" 

" Completely drown his voice by scraping our 
feet." 

" You certainly are beside yourself, James. I 
cannot believe that you would join in doing so 
wrong a deed. In this you would not only insult 
the institution, but Heaven." 

" Oh no. Heaven doesn't have much to do with 
the six o'clock prayers of college students." 

" You speak with an unbecoming levity, James." 



 

'" Do I indeed ?" The lip of the boy slightly 
curled. 

"' What else is to be done ?" asked Clarence, not 
noticing the manner of his companion. 

" All sorts of things. Every regulation of the 
college is to be broken, unless our wishes are com- 
plied with. Wait a little, and you will see fun. 
But let me tell you — it is determined that every 
student who does not join us, shall be dipped in 
the horse-pond. You had better consent. I should 
hate to see any thing done to you." 

The eyes of Clarence instantly flashed, and his 
cheeks grew red as crimson. 

" I would not consent if my life were taken," said 
the high-spirited boy. " But never fear. There is 
no one here that dare lay his hands upon me." 

" Don't trust to that. There are those here who 
dare lay their hands upon any body, and who will 
do it too. Come, then, say you will join us." 

' No — never." 

" You will be sorry when it is too late." 

" I have no fears." 

On the next day, the matter was publicly broach- 
ed during the college recess, when the students 
were alone. 

" I move," said one, " that we begin on the 
morning after to-morrow." 



 

" Second the motion," came from three or four 
voices. 

"All who are in favor, hold up your hands." 

More than a hundred hands were thrown into 
the air. 

" All who are opposed will now hold up their 
hands." 

A deep silence followed. Then a single hand 
was raised — then Another, and another, until ten 
hands were seen above the heads of the crowd. — 
It was the hand of Clarence that first went up. 

A murmur of discontent ran through the body 
of students, which deepened into execrations and 
threats. Half a dozen who were nearest Clarence 
gathered round him, with earnest and half angry 
remonstrances. His only reply was — 

" It is wrong, and I cannot join you." 

" The regulation is oppressive," it was argued. 

" Then leave the institution ; but do not violate 



ws. 




" That is easily said. But others have a word 
in that as well as ourselves. All here are not ex- 
actly free to do as they please." 

" It is better to endure what seems oppressive, 
than to do wrong." 

" We don't mean to do wrong I" said several 
voices, 



" You threaten to dip any one in the horse-pond 
who does not join you." 

Several of the students looked confused, but one 
or two cried out — 

" Certainly we do ; and what is more, our threats 
shall be executed."
