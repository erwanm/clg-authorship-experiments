crossed to the bed, Edith following. The child reached up her arms and
put them about Mrs. Morton’s neck, kissing her as she did so.

It took Edith some time to adjust herself to the scene before her. Mrs.
Morton knew all the children, and had a word of cheer or sympathy for
most of them as she passed from bed to bed through the ward. Gradually
the first painful impressions wore off, and Edith felt herself drawn to
the little patients, and before five minutes had passed her heart was
full of a strong desire to do whatever lay in her power to help and
comfort them. After spending half an hour with the girls, during which
time Edith talked and read to a number of them, Mrs. Morton said,

“Now let us go into the boys’ ward.”

They crossed the hall together, and entered the room on the other side.
Here, as in the opposite ward, Mrs. Morton was recognized as welcome
visitor. Every face that happened to be turned to the door brightened at
her entrance.

“There’s a dear child in this ward,” said Mrs. Morton as they stood for
a moment in the door looking about the room. “He was picked up in the
street about a week ago, hurt by a passing vehicle, and brought here. We
have not been able to learn anything about him.”

Edith’s heart gave a sudden leap, but she held it down with all the
self-control she could assume, trying to be calm.

“Where is he?” she asked, in a voice so altered from its natural tone
that Mrs. Morton turned and looked at her in surprise.

“Over in that corner,” she answered, pointing down the room.

Edith started forward, Mrs. Morton at her side.

“Here he is,” said the latter, pausing at a bed on which child with
fair face, blue eyes and golden hair was lying. A single glance sent the
blood back to Edith’s heart. A faintness came over her; everything grew
dark. She sat down to keep from falling.

As quickly as possible and by another strong effort of will she rallied
herself.

“Yes,” she said, in a faint undertone in which was no apparent interest,
“he is a dear little fellow.”

As she spoke she laid her hand softly on the child’s head, but not in a
way to bring any response. He looked at her curiously, and seemed half
afraid.

Meanwhile, a child occupying a bed only a few feet off had started up
quickly on seeing Edith, and now sat with his large brown eyes fixed
eagerly upon her, his lips apart and his hands extended. But Edith did
not notice him. Presently she got up from beside the bed and was turning
away when the other child, with a kind of despairing look in his face,
cried out,

“Lady, lady! oh, lady!”

The voice reached Edith’s ears. She turned, and saw the face of Andy.
Swift as a flash she was upon him, gathering him in her arms and crying
out, in a wild passion of joy that could not be repressed,

“Oh, my baby! my baby! my boy! my boy! Bless God! thank God! oh, my
baby!”

Startled by this sudden outcry, the resident physician and two nurses
who were in the ward hurried down the room to see what it meant. Edith
had the child hugged tightly to her bosom, and resisted all their
efforts to remove him.

“My dear madam,” said the doctor, “you will do him some harm if you
don’t take care.”

“Hurt my baby? Oh no, no!” she answered, relaxing her hold and gazing
down upon Andy as she let him fall away from her bosom. Then lifting her
eyes to the physician, her face so flooded with love and inexpressible
joy that it seemed like some heavenly transfiguration, she murmured, in
a low voice full of the deepest tenderness,

“Oh no. I will not do my baby any harm.”

“My dear, dear friend,” said Mrs. Morton, recovering from the shock of
her first surprise and fearing that Edith had suddenly lost her mind,
“you cannot mean what you say;” and she reached down for the child and
made a movement as if she were going to lift him away from her arms.

A look of angry resistance swept across Edith’s pale face. There was a
flash of defiance in her eyes.

“No, no! You must not touch him,” she exclaimed; “I will die before
giving him up. My baby!”

And now, breaking down from her intense excitement, she bent over
the child again, weeping and sobbing. Waiting until this paroxysm had
expended itself, Mrs. Morton, who had not failed to notice that Andy
never turned his eyes for an instant away from Edith, nor resisted her
strained clasp or wild caresses, but lay passive against her with a look
of rest and peace in his face, said,

“How shall we know that he is your baby?”

At this Edith drew herself up, the light on her countenance fading
out. Then catching at the child’s arm, she pulled the loose sleeve that
covered it above the elbow with hands that shook like aspens. Another
cry of joy broke from her as she saw a small red mark standing out clear
from the snowy skin. She kissed it over and over again, sobbing,

“My baby! Yes, thank God! my own long-lost baby!”

And still the child showed no excitement, but lay very quiet, looking at
Edith whenever he could see her countenance, the peace and rest on his
face as unchanging as if it were not really a living and mobile face,
but one cut into this expression by the hands of an artist.

“How shall you know?” asked Edith, now remembering the question of Mrs.
Morton. And she drew up her own sleeve and showed on one of her arms a
mark as clearly defined and bright as that on the child’s arm.

No one sought to hinder Edith as she rose to her feet holding Andy,
after she had wrapped the bed-clothes about him.
