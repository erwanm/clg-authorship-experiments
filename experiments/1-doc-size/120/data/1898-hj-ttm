time quite in the swing and describing a considerable curve. “Dear
Mr. Prodmore, why are you so imprudent as to make your daughter
afraid of you? You should have taught her to confide in you. She has
clearly shown me,” she almost soothingly pursued, “that she can
confide.”

Mr. Prodmore, however, suddenly starting, looked far from
soothed. “She confides in you?”

“You may take it from me!” Mrs. Gracedew laughed. “Let me suggest
that, as fortune has thrown us together a minute, you follow her good
example.” She put out a reassuring hand--she could perfectly show
him the way. “Tell me, for instance, the ground of your objection
to poor Mr. Pegg. I mean Mr. Pegg of Bellborough, Mr. Hall Pegg, the
godson of your daughter’s grandmother and the associate of his father
in their flourishing house; to whom (as he is to it and to her)
Miss Prodmore’s devotedly attached.”

Mr. Prodmore had in the course of this speech availed himself of the
support of the nearest chair, where, in spite of his subsidence, he
appeared in his amazement twice his natural size. “It has gone so far
as that?”

She rose before him as if in triumph. “It has gone so far that you
had better let it go the rest of the way!”

He had lost breath, but he had positively gained dignity. “It’s too
monstrous, to have plotted to keep me in the dark!”

“Why, it’s only when you’re kept in the dark that your daughter’s
kept in the light!” She argued it with a candour that might
have served for brilliancy. “It’s at her own earnest request
that I plead to you for her liberty of choice. She’s an honest
girl--perhaps even a peculiar girl; and she’s not a baby. You
over-do, I think, the nursing. She has a perfect right to her
preference.”

Poor Mr. Prodmore couldn’t help taking it from her, and, this being
the case, he still took it in the most convenient way. “And pray
haven’t I a perfect right to mine?” he asked from his chair.

She fairly seemed to serve it up to him--to put down the dish with a
flourish. “Not at her expense. You expect her to give up too much.”

“And what has she,” he appealed, “expected me to give up? What
but the desire of my heart and the dream of my life? Captain Yule
announced to me but a few minutes since his intention to offer her his
hand.”

She faced him on it as over the table. “Well, if he does, I think
he’ll simply find----”

“Find what?” They looked at each other hard.

“Why, that she won’t have it.”

Oh, Mr. Prodmore now sprang up. “She will!”

“She won’t!” Mrs. Gracedew more distinctly repeated.

“She shall!” returned her adversary, making for the staircase
with the evident sense of where reinforcement might be most required.

Mrs. Gracedew, however, with a spring, was well before him. “She
shan’t!” She spoke with positive passion and practically so barred
the way that he stood arrested and bewildered, and they faced each
other, for a flash, like enemies. But it all went out, on her part, in
a flash too--in a sudden wonderful smile. “Now tell me how much!”

Mr. Prodmore continued to glare--the sweat was on his brow. But while
he slowly wiped it with a pocket-handkerchief of splendid scarlet
silk, he remained so silent that he would have had for a spectator the
effect of meeting in a manner her question. More formally to answer
it he had at last to turn away. “How can I tell you anything so
preposterous?”

She was all ready to inform him. “Simply by computing the total
amount to which, for your benefit, this unhappy estate is burdened.”
He listened with his back presented, but that appeared to strike her,
as she fixed this expanse, as an encouragement to proceed. “If
I’ve troubled you by showing you that your speculation is built on
the sand, let me atone for it by my eagerness to take off your hands an
investment from which you derive so little profit.”

He at last gave her his attention, but quite as if there were nothing
in it. “And pray what profit will you derive----?”

“Ah, that’s my own secret!” She would show him as well no glimpse
of it--her laugh but rattled the box. “I want this house!”

“So do I, damn me!” he roundly returned; “and that’s why I’ve
practically paid for it!” He stuffed away his pocket-handkerchief.

There was nevertheless something in her that could hold him, and it
came out, after an instant, quietly and reasonably enough. “I’ll
practically pay for it, Mr. Prodmore--if you’ll only tell me your
figure.”

“My figure?”

“Your figure.”

Mr. Prodmore waited--then removed his eyes from her face. He appeared
to have waited on purpose to let her hope of a soft answer fall from a
greater height. “My figure would be quite my own!”

“Then it will match, in that respect,” Mrs. Gracedew laughed,
“this overture, which is quite my own! As soon as you’ve let me
know it I cable to Missoura Top to have the money sent right out to
you.”

Mr. Prodmore surveyed in a superior manner this artless picture of a
stroke of business. “You imagine that having the money sent right out
to me will make you owner of this place?”

She herself, with her head on one side, studied her sketch and seemed
to twirl her pencil. “No--not quite. But I’ll settle the rest with
Captain Yule.”

Her companion looked, over his white waistcoat, at his large tense
