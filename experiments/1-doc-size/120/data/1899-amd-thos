reasonable tempers. And she had given thanks when 
she remarked the fact of his growing into accord with 
papa, of his paying a sweet filial reverence, and no longer 
indulging in cynical and faithless flings. 

He went to the station on Saturday and brought home 
not only Princess' lover, but Bertram, who coaxed the 
indulgence out of him and was full of enthusiastic joy 
over his father's recovery. 





Before Sunday evening the household felt in the very 
air that Professor Kenneth belonged to Princess in some 
mysterious manner. They sat out on the wide, fragrant 
porch and watched the young moon coming up, and he 
had little difficulty in finding love's own mysterious lan- 
guage into which to put sentences as he held the dainty 
little hands. But she was glad the soft twilight hid her 
glowing cheeks. 

All day he had hidden half his errand. But it was 
confessed on Monday. He had received a very flatter- 
ing proposal to be one of the speakers at the Oxford 
Summer School, and also to deliver a course of five lec- 
tures before a scientific society of note. He would have to 
go abroad immediately after commencement, when his 
duties in the city ended. There would be a stay of a 
month at least in London, and then time for a little tour 
on the continent. And if he might take Princess ! 

Of course he had no more idea of wedding finery 
than he had of building a house, only people were mar- 
ried every day and went their way as if it was the sim- 
plest thing in the world. The journey would be so de- 
lightful for Princess, and somehow she rather longed to 
see her husband acquit himself among the English 
savants. Then the season would be at its height, and 
after all it was quite a grand thing to see the titled style 
and quality. 

"But I promised mamma a year," she said, ruefully. 
" I thought it would be a long engagement." 

" But I have loved you a long while," he said, in reply, 
" and it has had the solemnity of an engagement to me. 
If you could only consent ; ' ' and there was a wistfulness 
in his tone that went to her young heart. 

Doctor Underwood had said a sea voyage would do 





more for the judge than anything else, and urged him to 
go. The Amorys would be abroad, and they had sug- 
gested Princess joining them. 

Grandmamma Beaumanoir and Aunt Fanny would 
care for the rest of the children and look after Sherburne 
House. 

However nothing was positively decided. The little 
mother must have time to consider. And only such a 
few weeks intervened ! 

Judge Beaumanoir had been very well pleased with 
his prospective son-in-law and quite satisfied with his de- 
votion. But he had grown so fond of his darling he 
hated to give her up. 

Perhaps it was the long talk the father and son had a 
few days later that settled the matter. For Sherburne 
explained his new resolve and begged that he might be- 
gin again, this time in truer earnest, and with a higher 
mental resolve. 

"I am still interested in medicine to a certain extent, 
but surgery is distasteful to me," he admitted. " I think 
I have been looking at Uncle Carew's standing and fame, 
without considering the steps necessary to reach it. And 
then I had a thought of playing Doctor Underwood's role 
down here, sometime, but he will have a son of his own 
to educate for the place, who will be a born surgeon." 

Judge Beaumanoir gave a satisfied smile. 

" Not all men can reach Doctor Carew's eminence, even 
if they do an excellent work in the world, and some of 
the most conscientious physicians live and die compara- 
tively unknown. But I think no man could drop down, 
or fail to do his best work with Aunt Lyndell for a com- 
panion. And you need not consider the past winter al- 
together wasted. You have gained some experience of 





the world, and if you settle to the law you will find that 
no knowledge and no training ever comes amiss." 

Sherburne colored. The other experience would re- 
main unconfessed where his parents were concerned. It 
was a boy's foolishness, and yet the sweetness of a 
first love lingered. And though he had felt a little 
affronted that Princess should consider it not only un- 
wise but of no great moment or permanency, he under- 
stood that her own half-hidden regard overwhelmed it 
when the love was acknowledged. He had also heard it 
whispered that his father had once been quite in love 
with Aunt Lyndell, and now they were excellent friends. 
Auntie Dell had loved some one else; and surely his 
father had been very happy. So his ill-fated regard was 
to remain a secret in Princess' heart. 

" I suppose I am thinking of the fame, and the â€” the
