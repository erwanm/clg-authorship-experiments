" Yes indeed, sir," said Ellen ; — " exactly." 

" And in return for all this, you have given this dear mo- 
ther the love and gratitude of vour whole heart, haven't 
you?" 

" Indeed I have, sir ;" and Ellen's face said it more than 
her words. 

" You are very right," he said gravely, " to love such a 
mother — to give her all possible duty and affection ; — she 
deserves it. But, Ellen, in all these very things I have been 







mentioning, Jesus Christ has shown that he deserves it far 
more. Do you think, if you had never behaved like a child 
to your mother — if you had never made her the least return 
of love or regard — that she would have continued to love you 
as she does ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, — " I do not think she would." 

" Have you ever made any fit return to God for his goodness to you ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, in a low tone. 

" And yet there has been no change in his kindness. Just 
look at it, and see what he has done and is doing for you. In 
the first place, it is not your mother, but he, who has given 
you every good and pleasant thing you have enjoyed in your 
whole life. You love your mother because she is so careful to 
provide for all your wants ; but who gave her the materials to 
work with ? she has only been, as it were, the hand by which 
he supplied you. And who gave you such a mother ? — there are 
many mothers not like her ; — who put into her heart the truth 
and love that have been blessing you ever since you were 
born ? It is all — all God's doing, from first to last ; but his 
child has forgotten him in the very gifts of his mercy." 

Ellen was silent, but looked very grave. 

" Your mother never minded her own ease or pleasure when 
your good was concerned. Did Christ mind his ? You know 
what he did to save sinners, don't you ?" 

" Yes, sir, I know ; mamma often told me." 

 Though he was rich, yet for our sake he became poor, 
that we through his poverty might be rich.' He took your 
burden of sin upon himself, and suffered that terrible punishment — all to save you, and such as you. And now he asks 
his children to leave orT sinning and come back to him who has 
bought them with his own blood. He did this because he 
loved you ; does he not deserve to be loved in return ? 

Ellen had nothing to say ; she hung down her head further 
and further. 

" And patient and kind as your mother is, the Lord Jesus 
is kinder and more patient still. In all your life so far, Ellen, 
you have not loved or obeyed him ; and yet he loves you, and 
is ready to be your friend. Is he not even to-day taking 
away your dear mother for the very purpose that he may 
draw you gently to himself and fold you in his arms, as he 





has promised to do with his lambs ? He knows you can never 
be happy anywhere else." 

The gentleman paused again, for he saw that the little 
listener's mind was full. 

" Has not Christ shown that he loves you better even than 
your mother does ? And were there ever sweeter words of 
kindness than these ? — 

" ' Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid 
them not ; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' " 

" ' I am the good shepherd ; the good shepherd giveth his 
life for the sheep.' 

" ' I have loved thee with an everlasting love ; therefore 
with loving kindness have I drawn thee.' " 

He waited a minute, and then added, gently, " Will you 
come to him, Ellen ?" 

Ellen lifted her tearful eyes to his ; but there were tears 
there too, and her own sank instantly. She covered her face 
with her hands, and sobbed out in broken words, " Oh, if I 
could ! — but I don't know how." 

"Do you wish to be his child, Ellen ?" 

" Oh yes, sir — if I could." 

" I know, my child, that sinful heart of yours is in the 
way, but the Lord Jesus can change it, and will, if you will 
give it to him. He is looking upon you now, Ellen, with 
more kindness and love than any earthly father or mother 
could, waiting for you to give that little heart of yours to 
him, that he may make it holy and fill it with blessing. He 
says, you know, ' Behold I stand at the door and knock.' Do 
not grieve him away, Ellen." 

Ellen sobbed, but all the passion and bitterness of her tears 
was gone. Her heart was completely melted. 

" If your mother were here, and could do for you what you 
want, would you doubt her love to do it ? would you have 
any difficulty in asking her ?"
