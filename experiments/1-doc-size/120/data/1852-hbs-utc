little thing looked ! But I had made up my mind yes, I 
had, I would never again let a child live to grow up ! I took 
the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, 
and kissed him and cried over him ; and then I gave him 
laudanum, and held him close to my bosom while he slept 
to death. How I mourned and cried over it-! and who ever 
dreamed that it was anything but a mistake that had made 
me give it the laudanum ? but it's one of the few things 
that I'm glad of now. I am not sorry to this day ; he, at 
least, is out of pain. "What better than death could I give 
him, poor child? After a while the cholera came, and 
Captain Stuart died ; everybody died that wanted to live : 
and I I, though I went down to death's door Hived! 
Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew 
faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever ; and then this wretch 
bought me, and brought me here and here I am ! " 




The woman stopped. She had hurried on through her 
story with a wild, passionate utterance ; sometimes seeming 
to address it to Tom, and sometimes speaking as in a 
soliloquy. So vehement and overpowering was the force 
with which she spoke, that, for a season, Tom was beguiled 
even from the pain of his wounds ; and, raising himself on 
one elbow, watched her, as she paced restlessly up and 
down, her long black hair swaying heavily about her as she 
moved. 

" You tell me," she said, after a pause, " that there is a 
God a God that looks down and sees all these things. 
Maybe it's so. The sisters in the convent used to tell me 
of a day of judgment, when everything is coming to light ; 
won't there be vengeance then ! * 

" They think it's nothing what we suffer nothing what 
our children suffer ! It's all a small matter ; yet I've walked 
the streets when it seemed as if I had misery enough in my 
one heart to sink the city. I've wished the houses would 
fall on me, or the stones sink under me. Yes ! and in the 
judgment day I will stand up before God, a witness 
against those that have ruined me and my> children, body 
and soul ! 

" When I was a girl I thought I was religious ; I used to 
love God and prayer. Now I'm a lost soul, pursued by 
devils that torment me day and night ; they keep pushing 
me on and on and I'll do it, too, some of these days!" 
she said, clenching her hand, while an insane light glanced 
in her heavy black eyes. " I'll send him where he belongs 
a short way, too one of these nights, if they burn me 
alive for it ! " A wild, long laugh rang through the 
deserted room, and ended in an hysteric sob ; she 
threw herself on the floor in convulsive sobbings and 
struggles. 

In a few moments the frenzy fit seemed to pass off ; she 
rose slowly, and seemed to collect herself. 

" Can I do anything more for you, my poor fellow ? " she 
said, approaching where Tom lay ; " shall I give you some 
more water?" 

There was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her 
voice and manner, as she said this, that formed a strange 
contrast with the former wildness. 





Tom drank the water, and looked earnestly and pitifully 
into her face. 

" missis, I wish you'd go to Him that can give you 
living waters !" 

"G-o to him! Where is he? Who is he?" said 
Gassy. 

" Him that you read of to me the Lord." 

" I used to see the picture of him over the altar, when I 
was a girl," said Gassy, her dark eyes fixing themselves in 
an expression of mournful reverie ; " but he isn't here. 
There's nothing here but sin, and long, long, long despair ! 
Oh !" She laid her hand on her breast, and drew in her 
breath, as if to lift a heavy weight. 

Tom looked as if he would speak again, but she cut him 
short with a decided gesture. 

" Don't talk, my poor fellow. Try to sleep if you 
can." And, placing w r ater in his reach, and making whatever little arrangements for his comfort she could, Gassy left 
the shed. 



CHAPTER XXXY. 

THE TOKENS. 

" And slight withal may be the things that bring 
Back on the heart the weight which it would fling 
Aside for ever ; it may be a sound, 
A flower, the wind, the ocean, which shall wound 
Striking the electric chain wherewith we're darkly bound." 

Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto iv. 

THE sitting-room of Legree's establishment was a large, 
long room, with a wide, ample fire-place. It had once been 
hung with a showy and expensive paper, which now hung 
mouldering, torn, and discoloured, from the damp walls. 
The place had that peculiar sickening, unwholesome smell, 
compounded of mingled damp, dirt, and decay, which one 
often notices in close old houses. The wall-paper was 
defaced, in spots, by slops of beer and wine ; or garnished 
with chalk memorandums; and long sums footed up, as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there. In the fire-place
