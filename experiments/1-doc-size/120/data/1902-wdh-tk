If this Mr. Trannel is an American, that is all that 
is necessary. We are all Americans together, and I 
don 't believe it will make remark, Lottie 's sitting on 
the beach with him." 

"I don 't see how he 's different from that Bit- 
tridge," said Boyne. "He doesn 't care for any 
thing ; and he plays the banjo just like him." 

Mrs. Kenton was too troubled to laugh. She said, 
with finality, " Lottie can take care of herself," and 
then she asked, " Boyne, do you know whom Ellen 's 
letters were from ?" 

" One was from Bessie Pearl " 

" Yes, she showed me that. But you don 't know 
who the other was fror. 

"Xo; she didn 't tell me. You know how close 
Ellen is." 
"Yes," the mother sighed, "she is very odd." 



 

Then she added, "Don 't you let her know that I 
asked you about her letters." 

" No," said Boyne. His audience was apparently 
at an end, but he seemed still to have something on 
his mind. " Momma," he began afresh. 

" Well ?" she answered, a little impatiently. 

"Nothing. Only I got to thinking, Is a person 
able to control their their fancies?" 

" Fancies about what ?" 

" Oh, I don 't know. About falling in love." 
Boyne blushed. 

" Why do you want to know ? You musn 't think 
about such things, a boy like you! It 's a great 
pity that you ever knew anything about that Bit- 
tridge business. It 's made you too bold. But it 
seems to have been meant to drag us down and 
humiliate us in every way." 

"Well, I didn 't try to know anything about it," 
Boyne retorted. 

" No, that 's true," his mother did him the justice 
to recognize. "Well, what is it you want to 
know?" Boyne was too hurt to answer at once, 
and his mother had to coax him a little. She did 
it sweetly, and apologized to him for saying what 
she had said. After all, he was the youngest, and 
her baby still. Her words and caresses took effect 
at last, and he stammered out, " Is everybody so, or 
is it only the Kentons that seem to be always put 
ting well, their affections where it 's perfectly use 
less?" 

His mother pushed him from her. "Boyne, 



 

are you silly about that ridiculous old Miss Eas- 
mith?" 

"No!" Boyne shouted, savagely, "I 'm not!" 

"Who is it, then?" 

"I shaVt tell you!" Boyne said, and tears of 
rage and shame came into his eyes. 



XXI 

IN his exile from his kindred, for it came prac 
tically to that, Boyne was able to add a fine gloom 
to the state which he commonly observed with 
himself when he was not giving way to his morbid 
fancies or his morbid fears, and breaking down in 
helpless subjection to the nearest member of his 
household. Lottie was so taken up with her student 
that she scarcely quarrelled with him any more, and 
they had no longer those moments of union in 
which they stood together against the world. His 
mother had cast him off, as he felt, very heartless 
ly, though it was really because she could not give 
his absurdities due thought in view of the hopeful 
seriousness of Ellen 's affair, and Boyne was aware 
that his father at the best of times was ignorant 
of him when he was not impatient of him. These 
were not the best of times with Judge Kenton, and 
Boyne was not the first object of his impatience. 
In the last analysis he was living until he could 
get home, and so largely in the hope of this that 
his wife at times could scarcely keep him from 
taking some step that would decide the matter 
between Ellen and Breckon at once. They were 
tacitly agreed that they were waiting for nothing 



 

else, and, without making their agreement explicit, 
she was able to quell him by asking what he expected 
to do in case there was nothing between them ? Was 
he going to take the child back to Tuskingum, 
which was the same as taking her back to Bittridge \
