uel had never dreamed that there were so many 
books in the world, and he gazed about him with 
awe, feeling that he had come to the sources of 
knowledge. 

That was Samuel's way. Both by nature and 
training, he had a profound respect for all au- 
thority. He believed in the majesty of the law — 
that was why it had shocked him so to be arrested. 
He thought of the chiu-ch as a divine institution, 
whose ministers were appointed as shepherds of 
the people. And up here on the heights was this 
great College, a temple of learning; and this pro- 
fessor was one who had been selected by those in 
the seats of authority, and set apart as one of its 
priests. So Samuel was profoundly grateful for 
the attention which was given to him, and was 
prepared to pick up whatever crumbs of coimsel 
might be dropped. 


" Ah, yes," the professor said, wiping his glass- 
es with a silk handkerchief. " Samuel — let me 
see — S amuel ' ' 

" Prescott, sir." 

" Yes — Samuel Prescott. And how have you 
been? " 

" I've been very well, sir." 

" I meant to leave a message for you, but I 
overlooked it. I had so many things to attend to 
in the rush of departure. I — er — I hope you 
didn't wait for me." 

" I had nothing else to do, sir," said Samuel. 

" The truth is," continued the other, " I'm 
afraid I shan't be able to do for you what I 
thought I could." 

Samuel's heart went down into his boots. 

" You see," said the professor a trifle embar- 
rassed, " my sister wanted a man to look after 
her place, but I found she had already engaged 
some one." 

There was a pause. Samuel simply stared. 

" Of course, as the man is giving satisfaction 
— you see — it wouldn't do for her to send him 
away." 

And Samuel continued to stare, dumb with ter- 
ror and dismay. 

" I'm very sorry," said the other — " no need to 
tell you that. But I don't know of any other 
place." 





" But what am I to do? " burst out Samuel. 

" It's really too bad," remarked the other. 

And again there was a silence. 

" Professor Stewart," said Samuel in a low 
voice, " what is a man to do who is out of work 
and starving? " 

" God knows," said the professor. 

And yet again there was silence. Samuel could 
have said that himself — he had the utmost faith 
in God. 

And after a while the professor himself seemed 
to realize that the reply was inadequate. " You 
see," he went on, " there is a peculiar condition 
here in Lockmanville. There was an attempt to 
comer the glass industry, and that caused the 
building of too many factories, and so there is 
overproduction. And then, besides that, they've 
just invented a machine that blows as many 
bottles as a dozen men." 

" But then what are the men to do? " asked 
Samuel. 

" The condition readjusts itself," said the other. 
" The men have to go into some other trade." 

" But then — the cotton mills are on half time, 
tool" 

" Yes, there are too many cotton mills." 

" But then — in the end there will be too many 
everything." 

" That is the tendency," said the professor. 





" There are foreign markets, of course. But the 
difficulty really goes deeper than that." 

Professor Stewart paused and looked at Sam- 
uel wondering, perhaps, if he were not throwing 
away his instruction. But the boy looked very 
much interested, even excited.
