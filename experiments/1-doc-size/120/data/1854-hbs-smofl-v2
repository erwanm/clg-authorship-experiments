Christ cannot sculpture a Venus." 

Our hotel here is very beautiful. I think it must have been 
some palace, for it is adorned with fine statues, and walls of 
real marble. The staircase is beautiful, with brass railing, 
and at the foot a marble lion on each side. The walls of my 
bed room are lined with green damask, bordered by gilt bands; 
the attendance here is excellent. In every hotel of each large 
city, there is a man who speaks English. The English language is slowly and surely creeping through Europe ; already 
it rivals the universality of the French. 

Two things in this city have struck me singularly, as pe- 
culiarly German : one was a long-legged stork, which I saw 
standing on a chimney top, reminding me of the oft-mentioned 
" dear white stork " of German stories. "Why don't storks do 
so in America, I wonder ? Another thing was, waking suddenly in the middle of the night, and hearing the hymn of the 
watchman as he announced the hour. I think this is a beautiful custom. 

In the morning, I determined to get into the picture gallery. Now C, who espoused to himself an " Amati " at 
Geneva, has been, like all young bridegrooms, very care- 
less about every thing else but his beloved, since he got it. 
Painting, sculpture, architecture, all must yield to music. Nor 
can all the fascinations of Raphael or Rubens vie in his estimation with the melodies of Mozart, or the harmonies of Beet- 
hoven. So, yesterday, when we found the picture gallery shut, 
he profanely remarked, " What a mercy ! " And this morning 
I could enlist none of the party but W. to go with me. We 
were paid for going. There were two or three magnificent 
pictures of sunrise and sunset in the Alps by modern artists. 
Never tell me that the old masters have exhausted the world 
of landscape painting, at any rate. Am I not competent to 
judge because I am not an artist ? What ! do not all persons 
feel themselves competent to pronounce on the merits of natural landscapes, and say which of two scenes is finer ? And 
are painters any greater artists than God ? If they say that 
we are not competent to judge, because we do not understand 
the mixing of colors, the mysteries of foreshortening, and all 







that, I would ask them if they understand how God mixes his 
colors ? " Canst thou understand the balancing of the clouds ? 
the wondrous ways of Him who is perfect in wisdom ? " If, 
therefore, I may dare to form a judgment of God's originals, 
I also will dare to judge of man's imitations. Nobody shall 
impose old, black, smoky Poussins and Salvator Rosas on 
me, and so insult my eyesight and common sense as to 
make me confess they are better than pictures which I can 
see have all the freshness and bloom of the living reality upon 
them. 

So, also, a most glorious picture here. The Trial of John 
Huss before the Council of Constance, by Lessing — one of 
the few things I have seen in painting which have had power 
deej>ly to affect me. I have it not in my heart to criticize it 
as a mere piece of coloring and finish, though in these re- 
spects I thought it had great merits. Bat the picture had the 
power, which all high art must have, of rebuking and silencing 
these minor inquiries in the solemnity of its morale. I believe the highest painter often to be the subject of a sort 
of inspiration, by which his works have a vitality of suggestion, so that they sometimes bring to the beholder even 
more than he himself conceived when he created them. In 
this picture, the idea that most impressed me was, the representation of that more refined and subtle torture of martyrdom 
which consists in the incertitude and weakness of an individual 
against whom is arrayed the whole weight of the religious 
community. If against the martyr only the worldly and dissolute stood arrayed, he could bear it ; but when the church, 
claiming to be the visible representative of Christ, easts him 

out ; when multitudes of pious and holy souls, as yet linen- 



 

lightened in their piety, look dh him with horror as an infidel 
and blasphemer, — then comes the very wrench of the rack. 
As long as the body is strong, and the mind clear, a consciousness of right may sustain even this ; but there come weakened 
hours, when, worn by prison and rack, the soul asks itself, 
" Can it be that all the religion and respectability of the world 
is wrong, and I alone right ? " Such an agony Luther ex- 
pressed in that almost superhuman meditation written the 
night before the Diet at Worms. Such an agony, the histo- 
rian tells us, John Huss passed through the night before his 
execution. 

Now for the picture. The painter has arrayed, with con- 
summate ability, in the foreground a representation of the 
religious respectability of the age : Italian cardinals, in their 
scarlet robes, their keen, intellectual, thoughtful faces, shad- 
owed by their broad hats ; men whom it were no play 
to meet in an argument; there are gray-headed, venerable 
priests, and bishops with their seal rings of office, — all that 
expressed the stateliness and grandeur of what Huss had 
been educated to consider the true church. In the midst of 
them stands Huss, habited in a simple dark robe ; his sharp- 
ened features, and the yellow, corpse-like pallor of his face, tell 
of prison and of suffering. He is defending himself ; and there 
is a trembling earnestness in the manner with which his hand 
grasps the Bible. With a passionate agony he seems to say, 
" Am I not right ? does not this word say it ? and is it not 
the word of God ? " 

So have I read the moral of this noble picture, and in it I 
felt that I had seen an example of that true mission of art 
which will manifest itself more and more in this world as 






Christ's kingdom comes; art -which is not a mere jugglery 
of colors, a gymnastic display of effects, but a solemn, inspiring poetry, teaching us to live and die for that which is 
noblest and truest. I think this picture much superior to its 
companion, the Martyrdom of Huss, which I had already 
seen in America.
