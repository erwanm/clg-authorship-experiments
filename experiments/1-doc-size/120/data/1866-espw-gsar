coming, and — knit ! ” 

“ When you get to be as old as I am, 
perhaps you will find out,” said her mother, 
smiling. 

“ It ’s time for the boy to be here,” said Mr. 
Breynton, making a third at the windows, 
shading his eyes from the light. 

“ I hope he won’t get chilled riding up ; it ’s a 
cold night.” 

“ I would have taken Billy and gone down 
for him, only the coach is so much warmer. 
There’s a fire in his room, I suppose?” 

“ Oh, yes ; Gypsy built it herself.” 

“I guess I did. I filled the stove almost to 
the top with pine knots; Tom always likes pine 
knots.” 


“ I stuffed in free newspapers,” put in Winnie, 
anxious for a share of the honours ; “ free 
gre-at big newspapers ’n some shavings. Be- 
sides, I frew in lots of matches, — they make 
such funny little blue blazes. You can play 
Fourth o’ July as well as anything.” 

“ Hark ! ” said Gypsy. They all tried to 
listen, but Gypsy jumped down from the window-sill, 
knocked over three chairs and a 
cricket, and was out of the door and down 
the yard before they knew what she was 
about 

“ Sleigh-bells, sleigh-bells ! The coach ! 
He ’s coming, coming, coming ! I see the top 
of his head, and the trunk, and — Oh, Thom-as 
Breynton ! ” 

And her head was on his shoulder, her arms 
about his neck, before the rest were down the 
steps. 

This is something like,” said Tom, when 
supper was over, and they were all sitting around 
the parlour fire ; “ haven’t seen a wood-fire since 
I went away.” 


‘'How does your stove work?” asked his 
father. 

“ Oh, well enough, — when it doesn’t smoke, 
and I don’t forget to put the coal on.” 

“ I used to think sometimes how you were 
sitting down evenings and looking into the 
fire,” said Gypsy, climbing into his lap ; she 
thought she should never be too large to climb 
into Tom’s lap. 

“Did you?” said Tom, with a queer laugh; 
“ well, you had your trouble for nothing. I 
was out with Hall mostly evenings.” 

“What about the study-hours?” asked Mr. 
Breynton. 

“ Oh, we don’t have study-hours at college. 
I did the studying round generally when I 
felt like it. Some jolly good times I had, 
though ! ” 

His father and mother exchanged glances. 

“ I do believe you ’ve grown tall,” said 
Gypsy, nestling closer to him. 

“You have, you mean. People of my age 
don’t grow tall in three months.” 



“ Grandfather ! 0-oh, just look at your 

moustache ! ” 

“ I should be happy to oblige you, but owing 
to a natural inability to see my mouth — ” 

But how it has grown ! I never saw it till 
just this minute, in the light. I never ! I guess 
the Yorkbury girls will rave about your coming 
back with it.” 

Handsome Tom drew his forefinger compla- 
cently across the ambitious silky line of darkness
which just escaped looking like a crocks and 
seemed to think this very likely. 

“Conceited fellow! You don’t deserve a 
sister to praise you up. But then it is so be- 
coming ! ” giving him a little squeeze to emphasise 
her words. 

“ Gypsy, Gypsy ! you will certainly spoil 
him.” 

“Not I. He’s past that. Now, Tom, you 
may just begin and tell me all about that funny 
little fellow with red hair they hazed so, and 
that time you grabbed Tutor somebody or other 
in the rush, and then — Oh, what did your
