disappointed for her friend. But on the other 
hand he had been such a good friend to them, and 
truly the author of their prosperity. Then he did 
need some woman’s counsel. How could he get 
along alone? Then, too, she, like most women, 
was interested in wedding gear. 

“ At your house,” she said, with cool delibera- 
tion, in the evening?” 

No, about four, I think, and then a little wed- 


 

ding feast. We’ll give the men a half-holiday, and 
you and Mr. Ross will come up ” 

“ We are going to mother’s,” hesitatingly. 
“ She is to come in and take the children with 
her on Tuesday, and they are to spend the whole 
vacation. We were to go Wednesday evening.” 

Wait until Thursday morning. Mr. Ross is 
willing. Then you can come up at noon, or you 
might come in the morning and he at noon.” 

The face and voice were alike persuasive. 

And the shopping, what about that?” she 
asked. 

“ Oh, when you can spare the time. Some 
things for the little girls, and — a pretty, soft 
wedding gown.” 

“ Silk? ” at a venture. 

No, I think I do not care for that. I saw 
some a few days ago. You know, if I gave her 
two or three diamonds and a handsome necklace 
and so on, that would be all right. We’ll save the 
diamonds until some other occasion,” and he gave 
a short laugh. ‘‘ Something soft and white and 
clinging ” 

White ? ” raising her eyebrows. 

Yes, I want it nice for the children to re- 
member. I want to think myself of some one 
in bridal fairness. Before, we went to a parson- 


 

age in everyday gear. It was sordid, joyless, not 
a friend to wish us Godspeed. It need not have 
been so, but I had not the courage to make a 
protest. It was all work and parsimony. It does 
not make the best kind of men and women, if 
it makes money. And now I am going to have 
it all different. We have no friends to annoy 
by our lack of conventionalism. It is just for 
ourselves. We shall live for each other and the 
children, going back to a certain youthfulness of 
gladness. I've been learning the pleasure it 
affords one’s self to give joy to others. And so 
if you will help me out a little — it is asking a 
good deal. She couldn’t do any of this even if 
we waited until spring without the neighborhood’s 
knowing and wanting to discuss and advise.” 

Mrs. Ross felt that she did not quite approve, 
but it was his life and his happiness. So she 
yielded and they did the shopping, she tempering 
the man’s ideas. An outfit for the little girls, and 
he found among what the magnificent saleslady 
called simple evening dresses something quite to 
his liking. 

“ That is nun’s-veiling,” said Mrs. Ross. It 
was soft and fine and prettily made, but not very 
grand. 

“ I didn’t want anything stiff or glossy, but to 


 

fall around like a cloud. Yes, that will do. And 
a pretty dress to wear to breakfast. I believe I 
should like pink.” 

She talked him out of that. There was a deli- 
cate gray with pink pipings and pale pink bows, 
so the order was made out. No, she would not 
take anything for herself — she was truly glad to 
be of service to him. 

“ Dan,” he said on reaching the station, drive 
round to the little old house.” 

The children had just reached home, having 
snowballed and sledded on the way. 

I want Chan to come over and stay all night,” 
he announced, and go to the city to-morrow. 
Nurse Jane wants to see him, and we’ll have a 
little lark by ourselves. Everything is all right,” 
he said with joyous, meaning eyes to the 
mother. 

So Chan put on his best suit and felt there was 
something gay and unusual in the air. 

There was his room that had been put in order 
as a surprise. The corner room had been newly 
furnished. It had a big bay window in it, and 
just off it, over the hall, was this with dainty 
papering, a little white bed, a handsome combina-
