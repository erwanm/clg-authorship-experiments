wash-tub for hire, or trudging daily to some remunerative task, while her daughters, after a fair education, idly flirted, and danced, and read, and finally 
married. Now, although that modus operandi sounds 
vulgar and ungrateful it is, biologically speaking, 
quite as it should be. Girls of that age should be 
tended as carefully as young plants; and, for that 
matter, it would be well if women until they have 
passed the high- water mark of reproductivity should 
be protected as much as possible from severe physical 
and mental strain. If women ever are to compete 
with men on anything like an equal basis, it is when 
they are in their middle years, when Nature's handicaps are fairly outgrown, child-bearing and its intervening years of lassitude are over, as well as the recurrent carboniferous wastes and relaxations. 

Why do farmers' wives look so much older than 
city women of the same age in comfortable circumstances? Not, we may be sure, because of exposure 
to the elements, or even the tragic loneliness that was 
theirs before the pervasion of the automobile. Women 
in city flats are lonely enough, but although those 
that have no children or "light housekeeping" lead 
such useless lives one wonders why they were born, 
they outlast the women of the small towns by many 
years because of the minimum strain on their bodies. 

As a matter of fact in the large cities where the 
struggle of life is superlative they outlast the men. 

*The French are far too clever to let the women in the munition factories injure themselves. They have double, treble, and even quadruple 
shifts. 



 

About the time the children are grown, the husband, 
owing to the prolonged and terrific strain in competing with thousands of men as competent as himself, 
to keep his family in comfort, educate his children, 
pay the interest on his life insurance policy, often 
finds that some one of his organs is breaking down 
and preparing him for the only rest he will ever find 
time to take. Meanwhile his prospective widow (there 
is, by the way, no nation in the world so prolific of 
widows and barren of widowers as the United States) 
is preparing to embark on her new career as a club 
woman, or, if she foresees the collapse of the family 
income, of self-support. 

And in nine cases out of ten, if she has the intelligence to make use of what a combination of aver- 
age abilities and experience has developed in her, she 
succeeds, and permanently; for women do not go to 
pieces between forty and fifty as they did in the 
past. They have learned too much. Work and multifarious interests distract their mind, which formerly 
dwelt upon their failing youth, and when they sadly 
composed themselves in the belief that they had given 
the last of their vitality to the last of their children; 
to-day, instead of sitting down by the fireside and 
waiting to die, they enter resolutely upon their second 
youth, which is, all told, a good deal more satisfactory than the first. 

Every healthy, and courageous woman's second 
vitality is stronger and more enduring than her first. 
Not only has her body, assisted by modern science, 



 

settled down into an ordered routine that is impregnable to anything but accident, but her mind is delivered from the hopes and fears of the early sex 
impulses which so often sicken the cleverest of the 
younger women both in body and mind, filling the 
body with lassitude and the mind either with restless 
impatience or a complete indifference to anything but 
the tarrying prince. To blame them for this would 
be much like cursing Gibraltar for not getting out of 
the way in a storm. They are the tools of the race, 
the chosen mediums of Nature for the perpetuation 
of her beloved species. But the fact remains â€” that 
is to say, in the vast majority of girls. There is, as 
we all know, the hard-shell division of their sex who, 
even without a gift, infinitely prefer the single and 
independent life in their early youth, and only begin 
to show thin spots in their armor as they approach 
thirty, sometimes not until it is far too late. But if 
you will spend a few days walking through the department stores, for instance, of a large city and observing 
each of the young faces in turn behind the counters, 
it will be rarely that you will not feel reasonably certain that the secret thoughts of all that vast army 
circle persistently about some man, impinging or 
potential. And wherever you make your studies, from 
excursion boats to the hour of release at the gates of 
a factory, you must draw the same conclusion that 
sex reigns, that it is the most powerful factor in life 
and will be so long as Earth at least continues to 
spin. For that reason, no matter how persistently 



 

girls may work because they must or starve, it is the 
competent older women, long since outgrown the 
divine nonsense of youth, who are the more satisfactory workers. Girls, unless indifferently sexed, do 
not take naturally to work in their youth. Whether 
they have the intelligence to reason or not, they know 
that they were made for a different fate and they 
resent standing behind a counter all day long or 
speeding up machinery for a few dollars a week. Even 
the highly intelligent girls who find work on news- 
papers often look as if they were at the end of their 
endurance. It is doubtful if the world ever can run 
along without the work of women but the time will 
surely come when society will be so constituted that 
no woman in the first flush of her youth will be forced 
to squander it on the meager temporary reward, and 
forfeit her birthright. If she wants to, well and 
good. No one need be deeply concerned for those 
that launch out into life because they like it. Women 
in civilized countries are at liberty to make their own
