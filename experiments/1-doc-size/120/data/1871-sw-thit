"Where is Blessington Avenue?" asked Letitia.

"It's away over the other side of the city," Anne answered.

"Well, I suppose there is all New York between us," said Letitia.
"Don't you think this is a delightful part of the town, Matilda?"

"I should think you would go back to Shadywalk, Anne and Letty, when
you have learned what you want to learn; it would be pleasanter to make
dresses for the people there, wouldn't it, than for people here?"

"Speak for yourself," said Letty. "Do you think nobody wants to be in
New York but you?"

"I don't want to live where Mrs. Candy lives," said Anne. "That's
enough for me."

The conversation had got into a very disagreeable channel, where
Matilda could not deal with it. Perhaps that helped her to remember
that it was getting late and she must go.

"How did you get here?" asked Letitia. "You could not find your way
alone. I declare! you don't mean to say that carriage is for you?"

"I couldn't come any other way," said Ma-tilda, as meekly as if it had
been a sin to ride in a carriage.

"I declare!" said Letitia. "Look, Anne, what a carriage. It is a close
carriage, just as handsome as it can be."

"Was nobody with you?" said Anne.

"No, she has it all to herself," said Letitia. "Well, I hope she'll
enjoy it. And I would be glad of twenty shillings to get a dress to
walk to church in."

Matilda was glad to bid good bye and to find the carriage door shut
upon her. She was very glad to be alone again. Was it any wrong in her,
that she had so much more than her sisters? It was not her own doing;
she did not make Mrs. Laval's wealth, nor gain Mrs. Laval's affection,
by any intent of her own; and further, Matilda could not understand how
Anne and Letitia were any worse off for her better circumstances. If
she could have helped it, indeed, that would have been another affair;
and here one thorn pricked into Matilda's heart. She might not have
thought of it if the amount named had not been just what it was; but
twenty shillings?--that was exactly the two dollars and a half she had
paid to be in the fashion as to her toes. Now was it right, or not?
Ought she to have those two and a half dollars in hand to give to Letty
for her dress? The thorn pricked rather sharp.




CHAPTER VIII.


It was growing dusk when Matilda got home. She tapped at Mrs. Laval's
door before seeking her own.

Mrs. Laval was sitting on a low chair in front of the fire. She had bid
"come in," at the knock, and now received Matilda into her arms; and
making her sit down on her lap, began taking off her things between
kisses.

"You have got home safe and warm," she said, as she pulled off
Matilda's glove and felt of the little fingers.

"O yes! I had a beautiful ride," Matilda answered.

"And a pleasant visit?"

Now the answer to this was not so easy to give. Matilda struggled for
an answer, but truth would not find one. Mortification did. She flung
her arms round Mrs. Laval's neck and hid her face, for she felt the
tears were coming.

"My darling!" said the lady, very much surprised,--"what is the matter?
Was it not pleasant?"

But Matilda would not say that either. She let her action speak for
her. Mrs. Laval kissed and caressed her, and then when the child lifted
up her head, asked in a more business-like tone, "What was it, Matilda?"

"I don't know,"--was all that Matilda could say.

"Were they not glad to see you?"

"I thought they were, at first," said Matilda. "I was very glad to see
them. Afterwards"--

"Yes, what afterwards?"

"Something was the matter. I think--maybe--they felt a little bad
because I have so much more than they have; and I don't deserve it any
more."

"I understand," said Mrs. Laval. "I dare say. Well, dear, we will try
and find some way of making them feel better. Don't you be troubled.
What have you been about all day? I have scarcely seen you. Did you go
to Laddler's this morning?"

"Yes, ma'am. Norton took me there."

"And you got your boots, such as you wanted?"

"I got them--I believe so. They are narrow toes."

"Was that what you wanted?" said Mrs. Laval smiling.

"I could have got broad toed boots for a good deal less, but he said
they were out of fashion; they were last year's style."

"Yes, he knows," said Mrs. Laval. "Of course he knows, for he makes
them."

"Don't other people know?"

"I suppose so," said Mrs. Laval; "but really I never think about it. I
take what he gives me and am sure it is all right. That is the comfort
of going to Laddler."
