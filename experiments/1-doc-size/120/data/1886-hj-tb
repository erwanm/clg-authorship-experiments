and then it subsided ; but before it had done so Ransom's 
definition of it had plainly become the true one. The tone 
of the manifestation was good-humoured, but it was not 
gratulatory. He looked at his watch again, and saw that 
five minutes more had elapsed, and he remembered what 
the newspaper-man in Charles Street had said about Olive's 
guaranteeing Verena's punctuality. Oddly enough, at the 
moment the image of this gentleman recurred to him, the 



 

gentleman himself burst through the other door, in a state 
of the liveliest agitation. 

' Why in the name of goodness don't she go on ? If she 
wants to make them call her, they've done it about enough ! ' 
Mr. Pardon turned, pressingly, from Ransom to the police- 
man and back again, and in his preoccupation gave no sign 
of having met the Mississippian before. 

'  I guess she's sick,' said the policeman. 

' The public 'll be sick ! ' cried the distressed reporter. 
' If she's sick, why doesn't she send for a doctor ? All 
Boston is packed into this house, and she has got to talk 
to it. I want to go in and see.' 

' You can't go in,' said the policeman, drily. 

' Why can't I go in, I should like to know ? I want to 
go in for the "Vesper"!' 

' You can't go in for anything. I'm keeping this man 
out, too,' the policeman added genially, as if to make Mr. 
Pardon's exclusion appear less invidious. 
. ' Why, they'd ought to let you in,' said Matthias, staring 
a moment at Ransom. 

'  May be they'd ought, but they won't,' the policeman 
remarked. 

' Gracious me ! ' panted Mr. Pardon ; ' I knew from the 
first Miss Chancellor would make a mess of it ! Where's 
Mr. Filer?' he went on, eagerly, addressing himself ap- 
parently to either of the others, or to both. 

' I guess he's at the door, counting the money,' said the 
policeman. 

'Well, he'll have to give it back if he don't look 
out!' 

' Maybe he will. I'll let him in if he comes, but he's 
the only one. She is on now,' the policeman added, with- 
out emotion. 

His ear had caught the first faint murmur of another 
explosion of sound. This time, unmistakably, it was 
applause the clapping of multitudinous hands, mingled 
with the noise of many throats. The demonstration, how- 
ever, though considerable, was not what might have been 
expected, and it died away quickly. Mr. Pardon stood 
listening, with an expression of some alarm. 'Merciful 



 

fathers! can't they give her more than that?' he cried. 
' I'll just fly round and see !' 

When he had hurried away again, Ransom said to the 
policeman 'Who is Mr. Filer?' 

'  Oh, he's an old friend of mine. He's the man that 
runs Miss Chancellor.' 

'That runs her?' 

' Just the same as she runs Miss Tarrant. He runs the 
pair, as you might say. He's in the lecture-business.' 

'Then he had better talk to the public himself.' 

' Oh, he can't talk ; he can only boss ! ' 

The opposite door at this moment was pushed open 
again, and a large, heated-looking man, with a little stiff 
beard on the end of his chin and his overcoat flying behind 

him, strode forward with an imprecation. ' What the h 

are they doing in the parlour? This sort of thing's about 
played out ! ' 

'Ain't she up there now?' the policeman asked. 

' It's not Miss Tarrant,' Ransom said, as if he knew all 
about it. He perceived in a moment that this was Mr. 
Filer, Olive Chancellor's agent; an inference instantly 
followed by the reflection that such a personage would 
have been warned against him by his kinswoman and 
would doubtless attempt to hold him, or his influence, 
accountable for Verena's unexpected delay. Mr. Filer 
only glanced at him, however, and to Ransom's surprise 
appeared to have no theory of his identity ; a fact implying 
that Miss Chancellor had considered that the greater dis- 
cretion was (except to the policeman) to hold her tongue 
about him altogether. 

' Up there ? It's her jackass of a father that's up there ! ' 
cried Mr. Filer, with his hand on the latch of the door, 
which the policeman had allowed him to approach. 

'Is he asking for a doctor?' the latter inquired, dis- 
passionately. 

'You're the sort of doctor he'll want, if he doesn't
