credit. There were mamma and Uncle Eobert and 
Emma, who was very sweet, and ' 

" But if the sower planted his seed, and there was 
no rain, or no sun, or no soft dew, would it grow and 
ripen ? You have been a little cheerful sunshine and 
a little softening dew, and gone on with the garden- 
er's tireless patience, and at last a tiny bud has put 
forth. It is the assistance of everything, not any one 
particular word or deed." 



 

" But is it not our duty to keep doing just these 
things for every one ? Some one is always doing 
them for us." 

" My child, yes. It is the little outgrowth of the 
greater love within us, the Divine love speaking in 
our familiar tongue. And if we could learn that it 
does not really impoverish us any ! If you break off 
the top of a plant it sends out two new shoots, and 
those below are strengthened. But sometimes the 
top is so dear to us that we cannot see all the grace 
and beauty and tenderness that may be evolved at 
the very next turn." 

She smiled a little, raising her clear, beaming eyes 
to meet the others so grave yet kindly. 

" I don't suppose Christ came down to save the 
world for his own pleasure." 

" No," she answered, softly. " He thought of us." 

" And he asks us to think of the brethren." 

They stopped at the door. " Some of the lessons 
have been almost forgotten," he said, with a smile, 
" but there is a little remaining." 

He went in and gave the invitation to Ada as well, 
and then left the girls together. 

Ada did not look as bright and cheerful as when 



 

she left Cedarwood. But she was very glad to see 
Kathie, and the parlors wore a cosier aspect than a 
year ago. There was a bouquet in a small vase that 
attracted the child's attention. 

" Papa brings me home a fresh one every day or 
two. I never knew that he cared so much about 
flowers, except to be proud of them when we had 
them in abundance " ; and Ada sighed over the lost 
treasures. 

" What have you been doing ? ' Kathie asked, 
presently. 

" Nothing much, I am afraid. I can't seem to get 
to a place where there is any method. Your house 
is so quiet and orderly that you can hardly under- 
stand the lack of system. We have had dreadful 
times with cooks, and that frets mamma. Then 
Mary had made up her mind to leave when her 
month was up, but I do believe I persuaded her 
out of it." 

" You had some influence then." 

" It was a hard situation. I know I never realized 
how much I demanded of a girl. It kept her always 
busy and always behindhand, for there is so much to 

do. She \iked us all, and was very well satisfied, only 

li 



 

the work was too hard. So I proposed to keep my 
room in order and take charge of the parlors, and 
after we had tried it a few weeks she was content 
to stay." 

Kathie smiled a quick approval. 

" But I get so tired at times. I believe I do not 
like to work, and it seems the same old thing over 
and over. I wish I had Miss Lauriston's gift for 
painting, I would study at once. I have tried a 
little, but I have no especial genius, that is clear." 

" And the music ? " 

" There are so many really good singers that it does 
not seem of much account, unless one wished to teach 
or to go on the stage. I don't suppose I ever could be 
a prima donna. So I play now and then for papa, o 
to keep the boys still. You would hardly believe 
that I have been learning some of the street songs 
to please them." 

" I am sure that is of some account," Kathie said, 
warmly. 

" But those are all such trifles." 

" And the trifles make the larger things." 

" You are a born philosopher, Kathie," Ada re-
