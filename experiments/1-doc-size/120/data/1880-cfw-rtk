moment or two, shuffled his feet to and fro on the sand, and 
noiselessly drummed on the sill with his long fingers ; then 
he went slowly down to the shore, where his boat was drawn 
up, and rowed himself across to the saw-mill. He felt a sort 
of guilt about that pink balsam, as though he had not per 
haps taken enough care of it ; but, in truth, he had watched 
every hair s-breadth of its limp, reluctant growth, knew its 
moist veining accurately, and even the habits and opinions, as 




it were, of two minute green inhabitants, with six legs, of the 
size, taken both together, of a pin's point, who considered the 
stalk quite a prairie. 

When she was eighteen and nineteen years old, Marion 
Manning had refused several suitors, giving as a reason to 
her mother that they were all detestable ; since then, she had 
not been troubled with suitors to refuse. There were girls 
with more coloring and brighter eyes in Wilbarger, and girls 
with warmer hearts : so said the gossips. And, certainly, 
the calm reserve, the incisive words, and clear gray eyes that 
looked straight at you of Marion Manning were not calculated 
to encourage the embarrassed but at the same time decidedly 
favor-conferring attentions of the youths of the town. Mrs. 
Manning, in the course of the years they had been together, 
had gradually taken Bro as a humble confidant : he knew of 
the offers and refusals ; he knew of the succeeding suitorless 
period which Mrs. Manning, a stanch believer in love and 
romance, bewailed as wasted time. " I could never have resisted young Echols," she said, " sitting there on the door-step 
as he used to, with the sun shining on his curly hair. But 
there ! I always had a fancy for curls." Bro received these 
confidences with strict attention, as valuable items. But one 
peculiarity of his mind was that he never generalized ; and 
thus, for instance, instead of taking in the fact that curly hair 
plays a part in winning a heart, he only understood that Mrs. 
Manning, for some reason or other, liked kinks and twists in 
the covering of the head ; as some persons liked hempen 
shoestrings, others leathern. 

" But Miss Marion is happy," he said once, when the suit 
orless period was two years old, and the mother lament 
ing. 

" Yes ; but we can not live our lives more than once, Bro, 
and these years will never come back to her. What keeps 
me up through all the privations I have suffered but the mem 
ory of the short but happy time of my own courtship and 
marriage ? " Her Mrs. Manning shed tears. The memory 





must, indeed, have been a strong one, the unregenerated hu 
morist would have thought, to " keep up " such a weight as 
hers. But Bro was not a humorist : that Mrs. Manning was 
fat was no more to him than that he himself was lean. He 
had the most implicit belief in the romance of her life, upon 
which she often expatiated ; he knew all about the first time 
she saw him, and how she felt ; he knew every detail of the 
courtship. This was only when Marion was absent, how 
ever ; the mother, voluble as she was, said but little on that 
subject when her daughter was in the room. 

" But Miss Marion is happy," again said Bro, when the 
suitorless period was now five years old. 

" No, she is not," replied the mother this time. " She be 
gins to feel that her life is colorless and blank ; I can see she 
does. She is not an ordinary girl, and needlework and house 
keeping do not content her. If she had an orphan asylum to 
manage, now, or something of that kind But, dear me ! 
what would suit her best, I do believe, would be drilling a 
regiment," added Mrs. Manning, her comfortable amplitude 
heaving with laughter. " She is as straight as a ramrod al 
ways, for all her delicate, small bones. What she would like 
best of all, I suppose, would be keeping accounts ; she will 
do a sum now rather than any kind of embroidery, and a 
page of figures is fairly meat and drink to her. That Miss 
Drough has, I fear, done her more harm than good : you can 
not make life exactly even, like arithmetic, nor balance quan 
tities, try as you may. And, whatever variety men may suc 
ceed in getting, we women have to put up with a pretty 
steady course of subtraction, I notice." 

" I am sorry you do not think she is happy," said Bro 
thoughtfully. 

" There you go ! " said Mrs. Manning. " I do not mean 
that she is exactly unhappy ; but you never understand 
things, Bro." 

" I know it ; I have had so little experience," said the 
other. But Bro's experience, large or small, was a matter of 




no interest to Mrs. Manning, who rambled on about her 
daughter. 

"The Mannings were always slow to develop, Edward 
used to say : I sometimes think Marion is not older now at 
heart than most girls of eighteen. She has always been more 
like the best scholar, the clear-headed girl at the top of the 
class, than a woman with a woman's feelings. She will be 
bitterly miserable if she falls in love at last, and all in vain. 
An old maid in love is a desperate sight." 

" What do you call an old maid ? " asked Bro. 

" Any unmarried woman over well, I used to say twen 
ty-five, but Marion is that, and not much faded yet say 
twenty-eight," replied Mrs. Manning, decisively, having to 
the full the Southern ideas on the subject. 

" Then Miss Marion has three years more ? "
