from one end of Italy to the other. On the other 
hand, there was the sea-wind raving about our train 
and threatening to blow it over, and whenever we 
drew near the coast, heaping the waves upon the 
beach in thundering menace. 

We weakly and fearfully remembered our former 
journeys by diligence over broken railway routes ; 
we recalled our cruel voyage from Genoa to Naples 
by sea ; and in a state of pitiable dismay we ate five 
francs' worth at the restaurant of the Civita Vecchia 
station before we knew it, and long before we had 
made up our minds. Still we might have lingered 
and hesitated, and perhaps returned to Rome at last, 
but for the dramatic resolution of the old man who 
solicited passengers for the diligence, and carried 
their passports for a final Papal visa at the police- 
office. By the account he gave of himself, he was 
one of the best men in the world, and unique in 
those parts for honesty and truthfulness ; and he be- 
sought us, out of that affectionate interest with which 
our very aspect had inspired him, not to go by 
steamer, but to go by diligence, which in nineteen 
hours would land us safe, and absolutely refreshed by 
the journey, at the railway station in Follonica. 
And now, once, would we go by diligence ? twice, 
would we go ? three times, would we go ? 

" Signore," said our benefactor, angrily, " I lose 
my time with you ; " and ran away, to be called- 
back in the course of destiny, as he knew well 
enough, and besought to take us as a special favor. 



 

From the passports he learned that there was offi- 
cial dignity among us, and addressed the unworthy 
bearer of public honors as Eccellenza, and, at parting 
bequeathed his advantage to the conductor, commend- 
ing us all in set terms to his courtesy. He hovered 
caressingly about us as long as we remained, strain- 
ing politeness to do us some last little service ; and 
when the diligence rolled away, he did all that one 
man could to give us a round of applause. 

We laughed together at this silly old man, when 
out of sight ; but we confessed that, if travel in our 
own country ever came, with advancing corruption, 
to be treated with the small deceits practiced upon it 
in Italy, it was not likely to be treated with the small 
civilities also there attendant on it, and so tried to 
console ourselves. 

At the moment of departure, we were surprised to 
have enter the diligence a fellow-countryman, whom 
we had first seen on the road from Naples to Rome. 
He had since crossed our path with that iteration of 
travel which brings you again and again in view of 
the same trunks and the same tourists in the round 
of Rurope, and finally at Civita Vecchia he had 
turned up, a silent spectator of our scene with the 
agent of the diligence, and had gone off apparently 
a confirmed passenger by steamer. Perhaps a nearer 
view of the sailor's hornpipe, as danced by that ves- 
sel in the harbor, shook his resolution. At any rate, 
here he was again, and with his ticket for Follonica, 
a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked man, and we will say 
a citizen of Portland, though he was not. For the 



 

first time in our long acquaintance with one another's 
faces, we entered into conversation, and wondered 
whether we should find brigands or any thing to eat 
on the road, without expectation of finding either. 
In respect of robbers, we were not disappointed ; but 
shortly after nightfall we stopped at a lonely post- 
house to change horses, and found that the landlord 
had so far counted on our appearance as to have, just 
roasted and fragrantly fuming, a leg of lamb, with 
certain small fried fish, and a sufficiency of bread. 
It was a very lonely place as I say ; the sky was 
gloomy overhead ; and the wildness of the landscape 
all about us gave our provision quite a gamy flavor ; 
and brigands could have added nothing to our sense 
of solitude. 

The road creeps along the coast for some distance 
from Civita Vecchia, within hearing of the sea, and 
nowhere widely forsakes it, I believe, all the way to 
Follonica. The country is hilly, and we stopped 
every two hours to change horses ; at which times 
we looked out, and, seeing that it was a gray and 
windy night, though not rainy, exulted that we had 
not taken the steamer. With very little change, 
the wisdom of our decision in favor of the diligence 
formed the burden of our talk during the whole 
night ; and to think of eluded sea-sickness requited 
us in the agony of our break-neck efforts to catch a 
little sleep, as, mounted upon our nightmares, we 
rode steeple-chases up and down the highways 
and by-ways of horror. Any thing that absolutely 
awakened us was accounted a blessing ; and I re- 



 

member few things in life with so keen a pleasure as 
the summons that came to us to descend from our
