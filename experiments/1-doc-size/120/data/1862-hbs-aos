which should forever sunder her from all human ties, and make her
inaccessible to all solicitations of human love. Therefore, after an
interval of silence, he answered,--

"Daughter, your plan is approved. Such pilgrimages have ever been held
meritorious works in the Church, and there is a special blessing upon
them."

"My father," said Agnes, "it has always been in my heart from my
childhood to be the bride of the Lord; but my grandmother, who brought
me up, and to whom I owe the obedience of a daughter, utterly forbids
me; she will not hear a word of it. No longer ago than last Monday she
told me I might as well put a knife into her heart as speak of this."

"And you, daughter, do you put the feelings of any earthly friend
before the love of your Lord and Creator who laid down His life for
you? Hear what He saith: 'He that loveth father or mother more than me
is not worthy of me.'"

"But my poor old grandmother has no one but me in the world, and she
has never slept a night without me; she is getting old, and she has
worked for me all her good days;--it would be very hard for her to lose
me."

"Ah, false, deceitful heart! Has, then, thy Lord not labored for thee?
Has He not borne thee through all the years of thy life? And wilt thou
put the love of any mortal before His?"

"Yes," replied Agnes, with a sort of hardy sweetness, "but my Lord does
not need me as grandmother does; He is in glory, and will never be old
or feeble; I cannot work for Him and tend Him as I shall her. I cannot
see my way clear at present; but when she is gone, or if the saints
move her to consent, I shall then belong to God alone."

"Daughter, there is some truth in your words; and if your Lord
accepts you, He will dispose her heart. Will she go with you on this
pilgrimage?"

"I have prayed that she might, father,--that her soul may be quickened;
for I fear me, dear old grandmamma has found her love for me a
snare,--she has thought too much of my interests and too little of her
own soul, poor grandmamma!"

"Well, child, I shall enjoin this pilgrimage on her as a penance."

"I have grievously offended her lately," said Agnes, "in rejecting
an offer of marriage with a man on whom she had set her heart, and
therefore she does not listen to me as she is wont to do."

"You have done right in refusing, my daughter. I will speak to her of
this, and show her how great is the sin of opposing a holy vocation
in a soul whom the Lord calls to Himself, and enjoin her to make
reparation by uniting with you in this holy work."

Agnes departed from the confessional without even looking upon the face
of her director, who sat within listening to the rustle of her dress as
she rose,--listening to the soft fall of her departing footsteps, and
praying that grace might be given him not to look after her: and he did
not, though he felt as if his life were going with her.

Agnes tripped round the aisle to a little side-chapel where a light
was always kept burning by her before a picture of Saint Agnes, and,
kneeling there, waited till her grandmother should be through with her
confession.

"Ah, sweet Saint Agnes," she said, "pity me! I am a poor ignorant
young girl, and have been led into grievous sin; but I did not mean
to do wrong,--I have been trying to do right; pray for me, that I may
overcome as you did. Pray our dear Lord to send you with us on this
pilgrimage, and save us from all wicked and brutal men who would do us
harm. As the Lord delivered you in sorest straits, keeping soul and
body pure as a lily, ah, pray Him to keep me! I love you dearly,--watch
over me and guide me."

In those days of the Church, such addresses to the glorified saints
had become common among all Christians. They were not regarded as
worship, any more than a similar outpouring of confidence to a beloved
and revered friend yet in the body. Among the hymns of Savonarola is
one addressed to Saint Mary Magdalen, whom he regarded with an especial
veneration. The great truth, that God is not the God of the dead, but
of the living, that all live to Him, was in those ages with the truly
religious a part of spiritual consciousness. The saints of the Church
Triumphant, having become one with Christ as He is one with the Father,
were regarded as invested with a portion of his divinity, and as the
ministering agency through which his mediatorial government on earth
was conducted; and it was thought to be in the power of the sympathetic
heart to attract them by the outflow of its affections, so that their
presence often overshadowed the walks of daily life with a cloud of
healing and protecting sweetness.

If the enthusiasm of devotion in regard to these invisible friends
became extravagant and took the language due to God alone, it was no
more than the fervid Italian nature was always doing with regard to
visible objects of affection. Love with an Italian always tends to
become worship, and some of the language of the poets addressed to
earthly loves rises into intensities of expression due only to the One,
Sovereign, Eternal Beauty. One sees even in the writings of Cicero
that this passionate adoring kind of love is not confined to modern
times. When he loses the daughter in whom his heart is garnered up, he
finds no comfort except in building a temple to her memory,--a blind
outreaching towards the saint-worship of modern times.

Agnes rose from her devotions, and went with downcast eyes, her lips
still repeating prayers, to the font of holy water, which was in a dim
shadowy corner, where a painted window cast a gold and violet twilight.
Suddenly there was a rustle of garments in the dimness, and a jeweled
hand essayed to pass holy water to her on the tip of its finger. This
mark of Christian fraternity, common in those times, Agnes almost
mechanically accepted, touching her slender finger to the one extended,
and making the sign of the cross, while she raised her eyes to see who
stood there. Gradually the haze cleared from her mind, and she awoke to
the consciousness that it was the cavalier! He moved to come towards
her, with a bright smile on his face; but suddenly she became pale as
one who has seen a spectre, and, pushing from her with both hands, she
said faintly, "Go, go!" and turned and sped up the aisle silently as a
sunbeam, joining her grandmother, who was coming from the confessional
with a gloomy and sullen brow.

Old Elsie had been enjoined to unite with her grandchild in this
scheme of a pilgrimage, and received the direction with as much
