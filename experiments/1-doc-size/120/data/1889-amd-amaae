had proved no great amount of trouble. I felt that 
I would like to select some industry that I could 
carry on with my business. We rather inclined to 
the flowers. Every year they would come more into 
use, and the demand increase. One needed larger 
grounds for poultry-raising. Still, I felt, that, if I 
pushed it, even on my limited scale, I should make 
several hundred dollars a year besides all we wanted 
to use in eggs or chickens. 

During March I accomplished the painting of my 
house. Pryor and Mr. Corwin bought a large amount 



 

of a new kind of paint, highly recommended for 
its durability; and the quantity I needed cost me 
thirty-two dollars. I painted all my blinds, and most 
of the house, hiring only ten dollars' worth of work 
done. 

I had managed to put by fifteen dollars a month 
of my wages, and at the end of the six months had 
seventy dollars ; but I found that Eve had been saving 
up the interest as well. We had thirty dollars of 
the egg-money, and feed enough now to last the next 
two or three months. Of course, we paid the other 
hundred dollars, and were very happy over it. Now 
it was just an even two thousand, the face of the 
mortgage. After all, we had not pinched ourselves. 
Still, I knew well, and insisted, that I could have 
done very little without Eve's help ; and she could 
not have helped if she had not earned money. True, 
we might have gone on living at the station or in 
three rooms, and rigorously denied ourselves all 
society. But the real question is, whether the pos 
session of houses and lands, and money in the bank, 
is worth the sacrifice of returning to semi-barbarism ; 
for a life of deprivation amounts to that. We prate 
of living simply, and find our tramps, who go back 
to first principles, and pay no house-rent, intolerable 
nuisances. As we lop off here and there, we drop 
down in personal neatness and the amenities of life. 



 

Philip Gilbert Hammerton has discussed this point 
with much truth and fairness. 

But the fact remained, I wanted to get my 
fortune faster than at the rate of forty-five dollars a 
month. Hundreds would have jumped at my situa 
tion. You may estimate the great army of the 
unemployed when you count the number who apply 
for any position. Not a week through the autumn 
but some lads stopped to question me about my road, 
or any thing in the vicinity. They doubtless went to 
others. Some were nice, honest-looking young men : 
some bore traces of dissipation. I felt my own 
poverty and inability sorely at such times, though 
we did often give them a good meal. 

Of course, there were higher salaries than mine ; 
but these more fortunate ones were not going to step 
out for my sake. Then, I had tied myself to this 
place while I had my house, and the living here was 
pleasant ; but I wanted to be making more than my 
monthly stipend when I was forty. 

The past six months, Eve had earned one hundred 
and forty-six dollars by music-teaching, thirty-five by 
holiday work, and our boarders had brought us in 
one hundred and eighty-eight dollars. 

Among other things, we discussed a hotel. Pryor 
was infusing his own enthusiasm into some of the 
sleepy Athenians, rather, I should say, into some of 



 

the new-comers. The old families like the Mont- 
gomerys could hardly have been blown out of their 
rut by a charge of dynamite. Strangers were coming 
in to look at property. The paper-mills company 
built a nice dock. There was one wretched little 
lumber-pile connected with a coal and wood yard, 
kept by a Mr. Van Alen, who was a counterpart of 
Mr. Montgomery, and who always talked as if Pryor 
were an adventurer, and would soon bankrupt the 
whole town. 

Meanwhile, Pryor sold the middle houses in his 
row, which were the prettiest, we all thought, and 
rented two more at eighteen dollars a month. The 
one at the upper end was the least desirable, as it 
had no southern exposure ; but, when he offered this 
for fifteen dollars monthly, it was eagerly snapped up : 
and at May, the last one was rented. Corwin had 
bought some other lots, and decided to build again. 
If I only had a little money to join them in a venture ! 

The Randalls were delighted with these evidences 
of prosperity. Some of the old houses were repaired 
and painted, the streets cleared of stray bushes and 
blackberry-briers. Two more villas were sold. 

Pryor had lent out some money on property at the 
foot of Jay Street, and now made its owner a fair 
offer, that was presently taken. With the backing 
of Mr. Wilbur, he at once opened a lumber-yard, to
