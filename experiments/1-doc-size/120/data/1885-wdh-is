much fortitude to hear what I have to say or not," 
she said, with her keen gaze fixed upon him. " It's 
simply this : I am going to take Imogene home." 

She seemed to expect that Colville would make 
some reply to this, and he said blankly, " Yes ?" 

" I came out j)repared to consent to what she 
wished, after I had seen you, and satisfied myself 
that she was not mistaken ; for I had always pro- 
mised myself that her choice should be perfectly 
untrammelled, and I have tried to bring her up v'ith 
principles and ideas that would enable her to make 
a good choice." 

" Yes," said Colville again. " I 'm afraid you 




didn't take her temperament and her youth into 
account, and that she disappointed you.'' 

" No j I can't say that she did. It isn't that at 
all. I see no reason to blame her for her choice. 
Her mistake was of another kind." 

It appeared to Colville that this very sensible and 
judicial lady found an intellectual pleasure in the 
analysis of the case, which modified the intensity of 
her maternal feeling in regard to it, and that, like 
many people who talk well, she liked to hear herself 
talk in the presence of another appreciative listener. 
He did not offer to interrupt her, and she went on. 
" No, sir, I am not disappointed in her choice. I 
think her chances of happiness would have been 
greater, in the abstract, with one nearer her own 
age ; but that is a difference which other things 
affect so much that it did not alarm me greatly. 
Some people are younger at your age than at hers. 
No, sir, that is not the point." Mrs. Graham 
fetched a sigh, as if she found it easier to say what 
was not the point than to say what was, and her 
clear gaze grew troubled. But she apparently" 
girded herself for the struggle. "As far as you 
are concerned, Mr. Colville, I have not a word to 
say. Your conduct throughout has been most high- 
minded and considerate and delicate." 

It is hard for any man to deny merits attributed 
to him, especially if he has been ascribing to him- 
self the opposite demerits. But Colville summoned 
his dispersed forces to protest against this. 

"No no, no," he cried. "Anything but that. 



 

My conduct has been selfish and shameful. If you 
could understand all " 

" I think I do understand all — at least far more, 
I regret to say, than my daughter has been willing 
to tell me. And I am more than satisfied with 
you. I thank you and honour you." 

"Oh no; don't say that," pleaded Colville. "I 
really can't stand it." 

"And when I came here it was with the full 
intention of approving and confirming Imogene's 
decision. But I was met at once by a painful and 
surprising state of things. You are aware that you 
have been very sick ? " 

"Dimly," said Colville. 

" I found you very sick, and I found my daughter 
frantic at the error which she had discovered in her- 
self — discovered too late, as she felt." Mrs. Graham 
hesitated, and then added abruptly, "She had found 
out that she did not love you." 

" Didn't love me ? " repeated Colville feebly. 

" She had been conscious of the truth before, but 
she had stifled her misgivings insanely, and, as I 
feel, almost wickedly, pushing on, and saying to 
herself that when you were married, then there 
would be no escape, and she must love you." 

" Poor girl ! poor child ! I see, I see." 

" But the accident that was almost your death 
saved her' from that miserable folly and iniquity. 
fes," she continued, in answer to the protest in his 
face, " folly and iniquity. I found her half crazed 
at your bedside. She was fully aware of your 




danger, but while she was feeling all the remors 
that she ought to feel — that any one could feel — 
she was more and more convinced that she never 
had loved you and never should. I can give you 
no idea of her state of mind." 

" Oh, you needn't ! you needn't ! Poor, poor 
child ? " 

" Yes, a child indeed. If it had not been for the 

pity I felt for her But no matter about that. 

She saw at last that if your heroic devotion to Jier " 
— Colville did his best to hang his pillowed head for 
shame — " if your present danger did not awaken her
