" I will not hold back my feet from the way 
of duty, if I see it plain before me. God being 
my helper, I will follow as he may guide. I 
love children. It is my delight to be with 
them." 



" Shall I'm ake the arrangement for you ?" said 
the friend. 

Again the face of Mrs. Fielding was over 
shadowed by thought. Her eyes dropped to the 
floor, she sat still and statue-like again. Some 
natural emotions stirred in her heart, and there 
was a brief struggle with them for the mastery. 
When she looked up, a sweet smile was touching 
her lips, like a sunbeam, and love sat in her se 
rene eyes. 

" If I am wanted, I will go," she answered. 

"You are wanted," was the friend 's decided 
answer. " To-morrow I will see you again," she 
said, as she pressed her hand in parting. 

In less than a week there was a change of both 
place and state with Mrs. Fielding. From sad, 
tearful, idle dependence, she moved upwards into 
a sphere of usefulness, in which her heart became 
at once interested. Three bright, beautiful, and 
affectionate little ones were given wholly into her 
care by a mother who was daily showing herself 
to be unworthy of the high and holy trust reposed 





in her by the Father of all human souls. Soon 
was transferred the sweetness of that unselfish 
love of children, which is the mother 's highest 
blessing passing from a cold and worldly heart 
to one in which suffering was accomplishing its 
true work. 

Mrs. Fielding, as we have said, was one of 
those who tenderly love childhood. Towards the 
babes, who were flesh of her flesh, this love was 
overshadowed by the weakness of a natural, ma 
ternal tenderness, that shrank from the exercise 
of needed discipline. Now, she was truer to all 
perceptions of right and duty. To her own chil 
dren, love had been weak and compliant, but to 
wards these children of her adoption, it was clear, 
strong, wise and tender. 

Five years passed on with Mrs. Fielding, each 
bringing to her heart new increments of abiding 
peace. The neglected little ones had been taken 
at once into her love, and wisdom had prompted 
this love ever to seek their highest good. They 
were, in her affections, as though born of her own 



 

body. The mother-instinct in her nature had 
gone fully out to them. 

Five years had passed ; and, for more than two 
years, the unworthy mother of these children had 
been at rest from earthly passion. Her sun 
went out ere life had touched its fair meridian ; 
and there was not much heart-grief at her loss. 
So the mere selfish worldlings die. Even those 
who stand nearest, and whose ties are, or should 
be, strongest, rarely sorrow as those who refuse to 
be comforted. 

A man of a strong, true, tender nature was Mr. 
Garland. Life to such an one, bound to a mere 
worldly, vain, selfish and fashionable woman, is 
little more than a weary desert. Dutiful, patient, 
and upright had he been through all the years of 
an unsatisfying union; and when death closed the 
compact, he gave tears to the memory of her who 
had once been dear to him ; of her who was the 
mother of his precious children and threw a veil 
over the unhappy past. 

Two years had lapsed away since the angel of 


death drew her from his side. Mrs. Fielding 
still held her place as the true mother of his chil 
dren. Her life had become so bound up in their 
lives their good so dependent on her ministra 
tion that no thought of separation had intruded. 

Is it remarkable that a true man and a true 
woman, whose daily lives so met in a mutual in 
terest, should be attracted by stronger forces ? Is 
it remarkable that respect, regard, and admiration 
should take love into their fraternity, and give 
her the highest place ? 

"As you are, and have been, for years, their 
true mother," said Mr. Garland, taking the hand 
of Mrs. Fielding one evening, as she came back 
from the apartment where the children slept, to 
their family sitting-room he had listened, as he 
sat alone to the tender inflections of her voice as 
she talked with, and read to them ; that voice 
stirring emotion deeper and deeper, like music to 
which the heart lifts itself in sweet responses. 
"As you are, and have been, for years their true
