talked low about the poor professor, and everybody 
was sorry for him, and sorry the world had made 
fun of him, and treated him so harsh, when he was 
doing the best he could and hadn't a friend nor 
nobody to encourage him and keep him from 
brooding his miud away and going deranged. 
There was plenty of clothes and blankets and every- 
thing at the other end, but we thought we'd ruther 
take the rain than go meddling back there. You 
see, it would seem so crawly to be where it was 
warm yet, as you might say, from a dead man. 
Jim said he would soak till he was mush before he 
would go there and maybe run up against that 
ghost betwixt the flashes. He said it always mado 
him sick to see a ghost, and he'd ruther die than 
feel of one. 
CHAPTER V 
We tried to make some plans, but we couldn't come 
to no agreement. Me and Jim was for turning 
around and going back home, but Tom allowed 
that by the time daylight come, so we could see our 
way, we would be so far towards England that we 
might as well go there and come back in a ship and 
have the glory of saying we done it. 
About midnight the storm quit and the moon 
come out and lit up the ocean, and then we begun 
to feel comfortable and drowsy ; so we stretched 
out on the lockers and went to sleep, and never 
woke up again till sun-up. The sea was sparkling 
like di'monds, and it was nice weather, and pretty 
soon our things was all dry again. 
We went aft to find some breakfast, and the 
first thing we noticed was that there was a dim 
light burning in a compass back there under a 
hood. Then Tom was disturbed. He says : 
' You know what that means easy enough. 
It means that somebody has got to stay on watch 
and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, 
or she'll wander around and go wherever the wind 
wants her to.' 
' Well,' I says, ' what's she been doing since — er 
— since we had the accident ? ' 
' Wandering,' he says, kind of troubled — ' wan- 
dering, without any doubt. She's in a wind, now, 
that's blowing her south of east. We don't know 
how long that's been going on, either.' 
So then he p'inted her east, and said he would 
hold her there, whilst we rousted out the breakfast. 
The professor had laid in everything a body could 
want : he couldn't 'a' been better fixed. There 
wasn't no milk for the coffee, but there was water 
and everything else you could want, and a charcoal 
stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars 
and matches; and wine and liquor, which warn't in 
our line ; and books and maps and charts, and an 
accordion ; and furs and blankets, and no end of 
rubbish, like glass beads and brass jewellery, which 
Tom said was a sure sign that he had an idea of 
visiting around amongst savages. There was 
money, too. Yes, the professor was well enough 
fixed. 
After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to 
steer, and divided all of us up into four-hour 
watches, turn and turn about ; and when his 
watch was out I took his place, and he got out the 
professor's papers and pens, and wrote a letter 
home to his aunt Polly telling her everything that 
had happened to us, and dated it 'In the Welkin, 
approaching England,' and folded it together and 
stuck it fast with a red wafer, and directed it, and 
wrote above the direction in big writing, ' From 
Tom Satcyer the Erronort,' and said it would sweat 
old Nat Parsons the postmaster when it come along 
in the mail. I says : 
' Tom Sawyer, this ain't no welkin : it's a 
balloon.' 
' Well, now, who said it was a welkin, smarty ? ' 
' You've wrote it on the letter, anyway.' 
' What of it ? That don't mean that the bal- 
loon's the welkin.' 
' Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a 
welkin ? ' 
I see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and 
scraped around in his mind, but he couldn't find 
nothing, so he had to say : 
' I don't know, and nobody don't know. It's 
just a word. And it's a mighty good word too. 
There ain't many that lays over it. I don't believe 
there's any that does.' 
 Shucks,' I says ; ' but what does it mean ? — 
that's the p'int.' 
' I don't know what it means, I tell you. It's a 
word that people uses for — for — well, it's ornamen- 
tal. They don't put ruffles on a shirt to help keep 
a person warm, do they ? ' 
' Course they don't.' 
' But they put them on, don't they ? ' 
' Yes.' 
' All right, then ; that letter I wrote is a shirt, 
and the welkin's the ruffle on it.' 
I judged that that would gravel Jim, and it 
did. He says : 
' Now, Mars Tom, it ain't no use to talk like 
dat, en moreover it's sinful. You know's a letter 
ain't no shirt, en dey ain't no ruffles on it nuther. 
Dey ain't no place to put 'em on, you can't put 'em 
on, en dey wouldn't stay on ef you did.' 
' Oh, do shut up, and wait till something's 
started that you know something about.' 
' Why, Mars Tom, sholy you don't mean to say 
I don't know about shirts, when goodness knows 
I's toted home de washin' ever sence ' 
' I tell you this hasn't got anything to do with 
shirts. I only ' 
' Why, Mars Tom ! You said yo' own self dat 
a letter ' 
' Do you want to drive me crazy ? Keep still ! 
 only used it as a metaphor.' 
That word kind of bricked us up for a minute. 
Then Jim says, ruther timid, because he see Tom
