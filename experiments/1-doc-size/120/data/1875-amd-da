' 'Barton — what would you advise ? " 

The words came brokenly. 

"If you want the matter settled, sharp, I should say 
place it in the hands of a detective this very night. 
You can tell this story, or not." 

Tremaine looted the other fairly in the face for a 
moment. 

"Barton," he began, in a curiously steady voice, 
"whatever happens, admitting this woman to be Mrs. 
Tremaine, I, her husband, declare her to be above 
the slightest suspicion. Whatever step she may have 
taken can be explained satisfactorily to me, the only 
man to whom she is accountable. You will remember ? " 

There was something very grand and manly in this 
simple defence. Barton felt awed by both face and 
voice. 

They were coming in to the city, and the two men 
parted with a friendly bow. 



CHAPTER m. 


A LINK IN THE CHAIN. 

RALPH TKEMAINE wandered about, aimlessly, 

 Barton's suggestion was repugnant to every sentiment of honor and 
delicacy. His own suspense was torture, but his suffer- 
ing for Dora brought a still keener pang. If this were 
she, by this one inadvertent step, she had placed herself 
in a false position, and he felt inclined to know more of 
it,before it was bruited abroad to the world. What he 
had said to Barton concerning her was the simplest 
truth. He felt sure that she could explain the matter 
satisfactorily, in the first five minutes they were together. 
But when and how should he see her. 

It was true that the little discrepancies kept haunting 
him. Had she intended to go to the city, or not? and 
then, who could have sent the note? There was, evi- 
dently, some secret, but that she had taken any wrong 
step, he refused utterly to believe. She might be willful 
and tormenting, she might tease him by refusing to an- 
swer questions, but he had never known her to tell a 
deliberate untruth. In fact, sometimes, he had thought 
her too frank, for honest. And surely if ever a woman 
loved, she had that morning. 



Therewith dismay he remembered her agitation, her 
terror at the possibility of some untoward event. She 
had even vaguely hinted at a separation, but she cer- 
tainly would have been a sufferer in such an event. 
Why, the mystery was maddening ! his brain whirled in 
helpless chaos. He knew not what step to take. 

It ended at last by his going to a hotel, as the city 
clocks told the hour of midnight. He used to do this 
in his bachelor dajs, when he was very busy and com- 
pelled to stay late. He gave a faint, wan smile at the 
remembrance, for it- seemed years ago, and yet it would 
be only two years, in August^since he had married Dora 
Verner. 

A rather peculiar marriage, to be sure. He had known 
Gilbert Verner many years, a sort of crabbed, dog- 
matic old fellow, but learned in many ways, and when 
he chose, a very agreeable companion. Some curious 
tie linked the two men together. He knew a niece came 
to live with him, adopted daughter, really , for he made 
the name of Verner legally her own. "The child of a 
sister who is dead," was all the explanation ever vouch- 
safed. In those days Ralph Tremaine was suffering 
from a hard blow of fate, and all women and girls were 
to him like shadows. 

How he had first come to take an interest in Dora 
Verner, he hardly remembered. Gilbert Verner was ill 
a long while, worse and better by turns, and no one 
could comfort him like Ralph Tremaine. So he had 






fallen into the habit of watching her, and being amused 
by her very indifference. If she had tried to attract 
him, he would have been wary enough, for he professed 
to have lost faith in the sex. 

One night Gilbert Verner thought himself dying. 
He gave Tremaine some instructions, making him 
Dora's guardian, and his executor, and then he bewailed 
the fact of having to leave her friendless. Where 
would she find a home? 

"If you were. only married, Tremaine." 
"Why should I not be? I can amply afTord it. If you 
will give me Dora — if she will many me!" 

He was very much astonished at himself, and not 
quite satisfied, perhaps, to have Mr. Verner accept the 
ofTer so readily. It came about without any trouble- 
some wooing, and a month afterwards, he was really 
glad to marry her. 

She had said — "I will not pretend that I am desper- 
ately in love with you, Mr. Tremaine, for that you 
would not believe of me, unless I were a forward, silly 
girl, but I do admire and esteem you highly. I think
