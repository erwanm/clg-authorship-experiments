" Sam Ray is a good fellow ; we will remem- 
ber him," added the bookseller, when he had fin- 
ished. 

" I shall remember him ; and only that I shall be 
afraid to go into the State of Maine after what has 
happened, I should pay him a visit cue of these 
days." 

" There you are wrong. Those who know your 
story would sooner think of giving you a public re- 
ception, than of saying or doing any thing to injure 
your feelings. Those who have suffered unjustly are 
always lionized." 

" But no one will know my story, only that I was 
sent to prison for stealing." 

" There you are mistaken again. We put articles 
in all the principal papers, stating the facts in the 
case, and establishing your innocence beyond a per- 
adventure. Go to Augusta now, Bobby, and you 
will be a lion." 



 

" I am sure I had no idea of getting out of the 
scrape so easily as this." 

" Innocence shall triumph, my young friend."' 

" What does mother say ? " asked Bobby, his coun- 
tenance growing sad. 

" I do not know. We returned from Maine only 
yesterday ; but Squire Lee will satisfy her. All that 
can worry her, as it has worried me, will be her fears 

 

for your safety when she hears of your escape." 

" I will soon set her mind at ease upon that point. 
I will take the noon train home." 

"A word about business before you go. I dis- 
charged Timmins about a week ago, and I have kept 
his place for you." 

" By gracious ! ' exclaimed Bobby, thrown com- 
pletely out of his propriety by this announcement. 

" I think you will do better, in the long run, than 
you would to travel about tije country. I was talk- 
ing with Ellen about it, and she says it shall be so. 
Timmins' s salary was five hundred dollars a year, and 
you shall have the same." 

" Five hundred dollars a year ! " ejaculated Bobby 
amazed at the vastness of the sum. 



 

" Very well for a boy of thirteen, Bobby." 

" I was fourteen last Sunday, sir ." 

" I would not give any other boy so much ; but you 
are worth it, and you shall have it." 

Probably Mr. Bayard's gratitude had something to 
do with this munificent offer ; but he knew that our 
hero possessed abilities and energy far beyond his 
years. He further informed Bobby that he should 
have a room at his house, and that Ellen was de- 
lighted with the arrangement he proposed. 

The gloomy, threatening clouds were all rolled 
back, and floods of sunshine streamed in upon the 
soul of the little merchant ; but in the midst of his 
rejoicing he remembered that his own integrity had 
carried him safely through the night of sorrow and 
doubt. He had been true to himself, and now, in the 
hour of his great triumph, he realized that, if he had 
been faithless to the light within him, his laurel would 
have been a crown of thorns. 

He was happy very happy. What made him 
so ? Not his dawning prosperity ; not the favor of 
Mr. Bayard; not the handsome salary he was to re- 
ceive ; for all these things would have been but dross. 




if he had sacrificed his integrity, his love of truth and 
uprightness. He had been true to himself, and 
unseen angels had held him up. He had been faith- 
ful, and the consciousness of his fidelity to principle 
made a heaven within his heart. 

It was arranged that he should enter upon the du- 
ties of his new situation on the following week. Af- 
ter settling with Mr. Bayard, he found he had nearly 
seventy dollars in his possession ; so that in a pecu- 
niary point of view, if in no other, his eastern excur- 
sion was perfectly satisfactory. 

By the noon train he departed for Riverdale, and 
in two hours more he was folded to his mother's 
heart. Mrs. Bright wept for joy now, as she had 
before wept in misery when she heard of her son's 
misfortune. It took him all the afternoon to tell 
his exciting story to her, and she was almost be- 
side herself when Bobby told her about his new sit-
