lately Miss Pinshon does not walk much."
"So you take the best of the day for philosophy?"
"No, sir, for mathematics."
"Oh!  Well, Daisy, after philosophy and mathematics have both
had their turn; what then? when breakfast is over."
"Oh, they have two or three more turns in the course; of the
day," I said. "Astronomy comes after breakfast; then Smith's
Wealth of Nations; then Chemistry. Then I have a long History
lesson to recite; then French. After dinner we have Natural
Philosophy, and Physical Geography and Mathematics; and then
we have generally done."
"And then what is left of you goes to walk," said the doctor.
"No, not very often now," I said. "I don't know why, Miss
Pinshon has very much given up walking of late."
"Then what becomes of you?"
"I do not often want to do much of anything," I said. "To-day
I came here."
"With a book," said the doctor. "Is it work or play?"
"My History lesson," I said, showing the book. "I had not
quite time enough at home."
"How much of a lesson, for instance?" said the doctor, taking
the book and turning over the leaves.
"I had to make a synopsis of the state of Europe from the
third century to the tenth;  synchronising the event and the
names."
"In writing?"
"I might write it if I chose,  I often do,  but I have to
give the synopsis by memory."
"Does it take long to prepare, Daisy?" said the doctor, still
turning over the leaves.
"Pretty long," I said, "when I am stupid. Sometimes I cannot
do the synchronising, my head gets so thick; and I have to
take two or three days for it."
"Don't you get punished, for letting your head get thick?"
"Sometimes I do."
"And what is the system of punishment at Magnolia for such
deeds?"
"I am kept in the house for the rest of the afternoon
sometimes," I said; "or I have an extra problem in mathematics
to get out for the next morning."
"And that keeps you in, if the governess don't."
"Oh, no," I said; "I never can work at it then. I get up
earlier the next morning."
"Do you do nothing for exercise but those walks, which you do
not take?"
"I used to ride last year," I said; "and this year I was
stronger, and Miss Pinshon gave me more studies; and somehow I
have not cared to ride so much. I have felt more like being
still."
"You must have grown tremendously wise, Daisy," said the
doctor, looking round at me now with his old pleasant smile. I
cannot tell the pleasure and comfort it was to me to see him;
but I think I said nothing.
"It is near the time now when you always leave Magnolia  is
it not?"
"Very near now."
"Would it trouble you to have the time a little anticipated?"
I looked at him, in much doubt what this might mean. The
doctor fumbled in his breast pocket and fetched out a letter.
"Just before your father sailed for China, he sent me this. It
was some time before it reached me; and it was some time
longer before I could act upon it."
He put a letter in my hand, which I, wondering, read. It said,
the letter did, that papa was not at ease about me; that he
was not satisfied with my aunt's report of me, nor with the
style of my late letters; and begged Dr. Sandford would run
down to Magnolia at his earliest convenience and see me, and
make enquiry as to my well-being; and if he found things not
satisfactory, as my father feared he might and judged that the
rule of Miss Pinshon had not been good for me on the whole, my
father desired that Dr. Sandford would take measures to have
me removed to the North and placed in one of the best schools
there to be found; such a one as Mrs. Sandford might
recommend. The letter further desired, that Dr. Sandford would
keep a regular watch over my health, and suffer no school
training nor anything else to interfere with it; expressing
the writer's confidence that Dr. Sandford knew better than any
one what was good for me.
"So you see, Daisy," the doctor said, when I handed him back
the letter, "your father has constituted me in some sort your
guardian, until such time as he comes back."
"I am very glad," I said, smiling.
"Are you? That is kind. I am going to act upon my authority
immediately, and take you away."
"From Magnolia?" I said breathlessly.
"Yes. Wouldn't you like to go and see Melbourne again for a
little while?"
"Melbourne!" said I; and I remember how my cheeks grew warm.
"But  will Miss Pinshon go to Melbourne?"
"No; she will not. Nor anywhere else, Daisy, with my will and
permission, where you go. Will that distress you very much?"
I could not say yes, and I believe I made no answer, my
thoughts were in such a whirl.
"Is Mrs. Sandford in Melbourne  I mean, near Melbourne 
now?" I asked at length.
"No, she is in Washington. But she will be going to the old
place before long. Would you like to go, Daisy?"
I could hardly tell him. I could hardly think. It began to
rush over me, that this parting from Magnolia was likely to be
for a longer time than usual. The river murmured by  the
sunlight shone on the groves on the hillside. Who would look
after my poor people?
"You like Magnolia after all?" said the doctor. "I do not
wonder, as far as Magnolia goes. You are sorry to leave it."
"No," I said,  "I am not sorry at all to leave Magnolia; I am
very glad. I am only sorry to leave  some friends."
"Friends " said the doctor.
"Yes."
"How many friends?"
"I don't know," said I. "I think there are a hundred or more."
"Seriously?"
"Oh, yes," I said, "They are all on the place here."
"How long will you want, Daisy, to take proper leave of these
friends?"
I had no idea he was in such practical haste; but I found it
was so.
CHAPTER VIII.
EGYPTIAN GLASS.
It became necessary for me to think how soon I could be ready,
and arrange to get my leave-takings over by a certain time.
