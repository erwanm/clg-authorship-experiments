of hearing the well-known voices, Marcia listened 
through a hesitating silence, which ended in a loud 
laugh from without, and a cry from her husband of 
" Well, I swear ! Why, you infamous old scoundrel, 
corne in out of the wet!" There ensued, amidst 
Bartley 's voluble greetings, a noise of shy shuffling 
about in the hall, as of a man not perfectly master 
of his footing under social pressure, a sound of husky, 
embarrassed whispering, a dispute about doffing an 
overcoat, and question as to the disposition of a hat, 
and then Bartley reappeared, driving before him the 
lank, long figure of a man who blinked in the flash of 
gaslight, as Bartley turned it all up in the chandelier 
overhead, and rubbed his immense hands in cruel 
embarrassment at the beauty of Marcia, set like a 
jewel in the pretty comfort of the little parlor. 

" Mr. Kinney, Mrs. Hubbard," said Bartley ; and 
having accomplished the introduction, he hit Kinney 
a thwack between the shoulders with the flat of his 
hand that drove him stumbling across Marcia 's foot 
stool into the seat on the sofa, to which she had point 
ed him. " You old fool, where did you come from ? " 



 

The refined warmth of Bartley 's welcome seemed 
to make Kinney feel at home, in spite of his trepida 
tions at Marcia 's presence. He bobbed his head for 
ward, and stretched his mouth wide, in one of his 
vast, silent laughs. " Better ask where I 'm goin to." 

" Well, I 'll  ask that, if it 'll  be any accommoda 
tion. Where you going ? " 

" Illinois." 

" For a divorce ? " 

" Try again." 

" To get married ? " 

" Maybe, after I 've made my pile." Kinney 's eyes 
wandered about the room, and took in its evidences 
of prosperity, with simple, unenvious admiration ; he 
ended with a furtive glimpse of Marcia, who seemed 
to be a climax of good luck, too dazzling for contem 
plation ; he withdrew his glance from her as if hurt 
by her splendor, and became serious. 

" Well, you 're the last man I ever expected to see 
again," said Bartley, sitting down with the baby in 
his lap, and contemplating Kinney with deliberation. 
Kinney was dressed in a long frock-coat of cheap 
diagonals, black cassimere pantaloons, a blue neck 
tie, and a celluloid collar. He had evidently had one 
of his encounters with a cheap clothier, in which the 
Jew had triumphed ; but he had not yet visited a 
barber, and his hair and beard were as shaggy as they 
were in the logging-camp ; his hands and face were 
as brown as leather. " But I rn as glad," Bartley 
added, "as if you had telegraphed you were coming. 
Of course, you 're going to put up with us." He had 
observed Kiuney 's awe of Marcia, and he added this 
touch to let Kinney see that he was master in his 
house, and lord even of that radiant presence. 

Kinney started in *eal distress. " Oh, no ! I 
couldn 't do it ! I 've got all my things round at the 
Quincv House." 



 

" Trunk or bag ? " asked Bartley. 

" Well, it 's a bag ; but 

" All right. We 'll  step round and get it together. 
I generally take a little stroll out, after dinner," said 
Bartley, tranquilly. 

Kinney was beginning again, when Marcia, who had 
been stealing some covert looks at him under her eye 
lashes, while she put together the sewing she was at 
work on, preparatory to going upstairs with the baby, 
joined Bartley in his invitation. 

" You wont make us the least trouble, Mr. Kin 
ney," she said. " The guest-chamber is all ready, and 
we shall be glad to have you stay." 

Kinney must have felt the note of sincerity in her 
words. He hesitated, and Bartley clinched his tacit 
assent with a quotation : " The chief ornament of a 
house is the guests who frequent it. Who says 
that ? " 

Kinney 's little blue eyes twinkled. " Old Emer 
son." 

" Well, I agree with him. We don 't care anything 
about your company, Kinney ; but we want you for 
decorative purposes." 

Kinney opened his mouth for another noiseless 
laugh, and said, " Well, fix it to suit yourselves." 

" I 'll  carry her up for you," said Bartley to Marcia, 
who was stooping forward to take the baby from him, 
" if Mr. Kinney will excuse us a moment." 

" All right," said Kinney. 

Bartley ventured upon this bold move, because he 
had found that it was always best to have things out
