asked distinctly for the doctor. 

 



The two men met courteously, but without 
cordiality. The preacher, with some hesitation, took 
the patient's chair. The physician retained his 
own. His manner was as grave as that of the 
other, and possessed, it might be said, an equal 
dignity. He was, in fact, the first to speak. 

" Well," he said, " my time is more than up. I 
am not sure whether I should thank you for the 
reprieve. But I am ready to hear whatever you 
have to say to me." 

" It will not take long," replied the preacher ; 
curtly for Sterling Hart. " It is chiefly in a word: 
You have given me to understand that you are 
an educated physician, properly graduated." 

" I have, because I am." 

" You possess, of course, the diploma of some 
accredited institution ? " 

" I don't frame it and hang it," returned Dr. 
Royal, with a smile whose bitterness was disguised 
by its gentleness. " It is in one of the drawers of 
my desk." 

"Are you willing — pray excuse me — that I 
should see it?" asked the preacher point-blank. 

" No," said the physician, with equal bluntness. 
" At least," he added, " not under the present 
circumstances. I can conceive of those in which I 
might be." 

" Pardon me," proceeded Sterling Hart,
without smiling, " but the time has come when I must 
tell you that it is said, — I have been told, — the 
authority is good, Dr. Royal, or you will believe 
that I should not act upon it. I learn that your 
name does not stand upon the list of registered 
physicians of this state." 

" Have you been meddling — looking that up ? " 

The lame doctor got to his feet, and took fire, 
like a less gentle man. 

"I never thought of it!" blazed back the 
preacher. " If I had, I should undoubtedly have 
done so. I have my cousin's interests to protect. 
Nothing else matters to me beside those. I could 
not have a charlatan — an adventurer — assuming 
and sustaining the position which you hold in this 
house." 

The doctor waved these words off with a ees- 
ture whose dignity impressed itself upon the 
preacher even in that agitated moment. 

" You would be quite right," he replied with 
unexpected self-possession. " I should not blame 
you. ... I suppose," he added, wheeling, " Frost 
told you this ? " 

Mr. Hart, too, got to his feet. He made no 
reply to this question, and the eyes of the two 
men met poignantly. Then the preacher said : — 

"Would it matter who discovered the fact — if 
it were a fact ? If it be a fact ? " 

 



" He is capable of it," mused the doctor,
looking into the fire more drearily than angrily. " I 
might have thought of it — I didn't, that 's all. 
. . . Mr. Hart ! " He turned his marred face with 
a pathetic movement, half appeal, half pain. " Mr. 
Hart! The time has come, I see, when I must 
answer your questions — some of them, at least. 
We both belong to the confessional professions. 
I ought to be able to trust you. Do you demand 
my confidence ? " 

" I demand nothing," returned the preacher, 
quickly. 

"Will you accept it, then ? " 

The preacher hesitated. " I can't put myself 
under bonds — " he argued hurriedly. " You must 
see that. All I can say is : I have never betrayed 
a human soul — that I can remember — in my 
life." 

" It can't be helped, at any rate," replied the 
doctor, wearily. " There is no other way. I must 
risk it. If you will be seated, Mr. Hart? Thank 
you. I am rather lame to conduct a difficult 
conversation on my feet. Are the doors all shut? 
Where is Mrs. Dane?" 

Mr. Hart looked out into the hall, and closed 
and locked the office door again. 

" I think she must be upstairs with Joyce," he 
said. He returned to his chair before the office
