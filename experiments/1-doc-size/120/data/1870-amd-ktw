in his mind, although it was a long while before he 
met with a chance to send again. Three years he 
spent in Africa, when he returned once more to 
India. No tidings there, and then he began to feel 
alarmed. He could hardly decide whether to go 
home at once or remain and try his fate a little 
longer. Then he resolved to go to Australia and 
make a fortune, and after that was achieved to come 
home and settle for life, unless those he loved were 
no longer living. 

Here Uncle Robert paused a moment. 

“ And was there any chance to make a fortune ? ” 



 


Eob uttered this in a slow, grave tone, and glanced 
up doubtfully. 

“ Oh,” exclaimed Fred, “ have you lots of money ? ” 

“ How much do you call lots ? ” 

“ Well,” said Freddy, meditatively, “ if you have a 
good deal, I ’d like to have a stunner of a present 
next Christmas.” 

“ Fred ! ” his mother exclaimed, in surprise. 

Uncle Eobert laughed. “ What do you call a stun- 
ner, Freddy ? ” he asked. 

“ I ’d like to have a sled bigger and handsomer 
than Charley Darrell’s. Wouldn’t I make her go 
down hill ! ” 

Kathie’s eyes suddenly grew large and luminous. 
She was glad to have Uncle Eobert just for himself, 
but what if he had come home rich ? Every pulse 
gave a quick throb. 

“ Well, Eobbie, what would you have done, — stayed 
and made a fortune ? ” asked his uncle. 

“ Wouldn’t I, though ! Just give me a chance to 
dig gold ! A pocketful of rocks wouldn’t be any- 
thing. What did you do ? ” 

Kathie leaned over breathlessly. Did such won- 
derful things ever happen to any one ? 


 


“ I made the fortune. It was difficult work, and 
I do not know as money would ever tempt me to 
undergo such hardships again ; hut it is over now, 
and I’m thankful that I have something to share 
with you all.” 

“ Hurrah ! ” shouted Rob ; “ Kathie, here ’s your 
prince, sure enough ! ” 

“ Was that what Kathie expected ?” 

“ She ’s death on fairy-stories, and this comes out 
exactly like one.” 

Uncle Robert turned her face around so that he 
could look into the eyes now downcast. 

“ And you wished for a fortune ? What would you 
do with it, Kathie ? ” 

“ Oh Uncle Robert, I never thought much about 
that, at least, not having it myself. I wanted to be a 
fairy and make everybody happy ; but I ’ve been learn- 
ing that there are a great many pleasant and good 
things besides money, though that is very nice. 



And we should be glad to have you even if you 
were — ever so poor.” 

“ My little darling, I am thankful for all your 
sakes that I can make the rest of life very delight- 
ful and happy. I think those who are cheerful and 


 


content in poverty will find, much to enjoy in a 
wider sphere. And I ’ll promise to be your prince, 
Kathie.” 

She smiled tenderly. 

“ This is better than the party, — isn’t it ? ” said 
Rob ; “ and I thought that splendid ! ” 

“ What about it ? ” asked Uncle Robert. 

Kathie colored and laughed, but was not very ready 
in answering. 

“ O, I ’ll tell you,” Rob began in great earnestness. 
“We have been poor all our lives, to be sure. If 
papa had lived it would have been different with us. 
I don’t know as I ’ve cared much about it, for I have 
managed to enjoy pretty good times, only now and 
then — ” 

Rob made so long a pause that his uncle said,
