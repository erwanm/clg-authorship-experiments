liver" (the two hundred! miles between St. Louis 
and Cairo, where the Ohio conies in) was low ; and 
the Mississippi changes its channel so constantly, 
that the pilots used to always find it necessaiy to 
run down to Tairo to take a fresli look, when their 
boats were to lie in port a week, that is, when the 
water was at a low stage. A deal (if this " looking 
at the river" was done by poor fellows who seldom 
had a Ijerth, and whose only hote of getting one 
la}' in their being always freshly pOsted, and there- 
fore ready to (h'op into the shoes of some reputable 
pilot, for a single trij), on account of such pilot's 
sudden illness, or some other necessity. And a 
good many of them constantly ran up and down 
inspecting the river, not because they ever really 
hoped to get a berth, but because (they being guests 
of the boat) it was cheaper to "look at the river" 
than sta} ashore and pay board. In time these 
fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested 
boats that had an established reputation for setting 
good tables. All visiting pilots were useful, for 
they were always ready and willing, winter or 
summer, night or day, to go out in the yawl and 
help buoy the channel or assist the boat's pilots in 
any way they could. They were likewise welcome 
because all pilots are tireless talkers, when gathered 
together, and as they talk only about the river, they 
are always understood and are always interesting. 

Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on 
earth but the river, and his pride in his occupation 
surpasses the pride of kiugs. 

We liad a fine company of these river-inspectors 
along, this trij). There were eight or ten ; and 
there was abundance of room for them in our great 
pilot-house. Two or three of them wore polished 
silk hats, elaborate shirt-fronts, diamond breastpins, 
kid gloves, and patent- leather boots. They were 
choice in their English, and bore themselves with 
a dignity proper to men of solid means and prodi- 
gious reputation as pilots. The others were more 
or less loosely clad, and wore upon their heads tall 
felt cones that were suggestive of the days of the 
Connnonwealth. 

I was a cipher in this august company, and felt 
subdued, not to say torpid. I was not even of suf- 
ficient consecpaence to assist at the wheel when it 
was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a 
hurry ; the guest that stood nearest did that when 
occasion required — and this was pretty much all 
the time, because of the crookedness of the channel 
and the scant water. I stood in a corner ; and the 
talk I listened to took the hope all out of me. One 
visitor said to another : — 

" Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up ?" 

" It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way 
one of the boys on the Diana told me ; started 
out about fifty yards above tjie wood pile on the 
false point, and held on the cabin under Plum 

Point till I raised the reef — quarter less twain — 
then straightened up for the middle hai till I got 
well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the 
bend, then got my stern on the cotton-wood and 
head on the low plac*' above the point, and came 
throu<'h a-boomin< — nine and a half" 

" Pretty square crossing, an't it ?" 

" Yes, but the upper bar's working down fast." 

Another pilot spoke up and said : —  

" I had better water than that, and ran it lower 
down ; started out from the false point — mark 
twain — raised the second reef abreast the big snag 
in the bend, and had quarter less twain." 

One of the i;or<xeous ones remarked : — 

"I don't want to find fault  your leadsmen, 
but that's a good deal of water for Plum Point, it 
seems to me." 

There was an approving nod all around as this 
quiet snub dropped on the boaster and "settled" 
him. And so they went on talk -talk -talking. 
Meantime, the thing that was running in my mind 
was, " Now if my ears hear aright, I have not only 
to get the names of all the towns and islands and 
bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up 
a warm personal acquaintances with every old 
snag and one-limbed cotton-wood and obscure 
wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river 
for twelve hundred miles ; and more than that, I 
must actually know where these things are in the 
dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that 

can piorce tln'()u<'h two luilcH of .solid hlaeknesM; 
I wish the pil()tin l)UHinos8 was in Jericho and I 
had never thought of it." 

At (hisk Mr. B tapped the his bell three 

times (the signal to land), and the captain emerged 
from his drawing-room in the forward end of the 
texas, and looked up inquiringly. Mr. B said: 

" We will lay up here all night, captain." 

" Very well, sir." 

That was all. The boat came to shore and was 
tied up for the night. It seemed to me a fine thing 
that the pilot could do as he pleased without asking 
so grand a captain's permission. I took m supper
