at once, knowing that she had barely time to dress for dinner. As she
opened the door of her sitting-room some one rose from the chair by the
fire, and she stood still, facing her husband....
It was the moment both had desired, yet when it came it found them
tongue-tied and helpless.
Bessy was the first to speak. "When did you get here? You never wrote me
you were coming!"
Amherst advanced toward her, holding out his hand. "No; you must forgive
me. I have been very busy," he said.
Always the same excuse! The same thrusting at her of the hateful fact
that Westmore came first, and that she must put up with whatever was
left of his time and thoughts!
"You are always too busy to let me hear from you," she said coldly, and
the hand which had sprung toward his fell back to her side.
Even then, if he had only said frankly: "It was too difficult--I didn't
know how," the note of truth would have reached and moved her; but he
had striven for the tone of ease and self-restraint that was habitual
among her friends, and as usual his attempt had been a failure.
"I am sorry--I'm a bad hand at writing," he rejoined; and his evil
genius prompted him to add: "I hope my coming is not inconvenient?"
The colour rose to Bessy's face. "Of course not. But it must seem rather
odd to our visitors that I should know so little of your plans."
At this he humbled himself still farther. "I know I don't think enough
about appearances--I'll try to do better the next time."
Appearances! He spoke as if she had been reproaching him for a breach of
etiquette...it never occurred to him that the cry came from her
humiliated heart! The tide of warmth that always enveloped her in his
presence was receding, and in its place a chill fluid seemed to creep up
slowly to her throat and lips.
In Amherst, meanwhile, the opposite process was taking place. His wife
was still to him the most beautiful woman in the world, or rather,
perhaps, the only woman to whose beauty his eyes had been opened. That
beauty could never again penetrate to his heart, but it still touched
his senses, not with passion but with a caressing kindliness, such as
one might feel for the bright movements of a bird or a kitten. It seemed
to plead with him not to ask of her more than she could give--to be
content with the outward grace and not seek in it an inner meaning. He
moved toward her again, and took her passive hands in his.
"You look tired. Why do you ride so late?"
"Oh, I just wanted to give Impulse a gallop. I hadn't time to take her
out earlier, and if I let the grooms exercise her they'll spoil her
mouth."
Amherst frowned. "You ought not to ride that mare alone at night. She
shies at everything after dark."
"She's the only horse I care for--the others are all cows," she
murmured, releasing her hands impatiently.
"Well, you must take me with you the next time you ride her."
She softened a little, in spite of herself. Riding was the only
amusement he cared to share with her, and the thought of a long gallop
across the plains at his side brought back the warmth to her veins.
"Yes, we'll go tomorrow. How long do you mean to stay?" she asked,
looking up at him eagerly.
He was pleased that she should wish to know, yet the question
embarrassed him, for it was necessary that he should be back at Westmore
within three days, and he could not put her off with an evasion.
Bessy saw his hesitation, and her colour rose again. "I only asked," she
explained, "because there is to be a fancy ball at the Hunt Club on the
twentieth, and I thought of giving a big dinner here first."
Amherst did not understand that she too had her inarticulate moments,
and that the allusion to the fancy ball was improvised to hide an
eagerness to which he had been too slow in responding. He thought she
had enquired about his plans only that he might not again interfere with
the arrangements of her dinner-table. If that was all she cared about,
it became suddenly easy to tell her that he could not stay, and he
answered lightly: "Fancy balls are a little out of my line; but at any
rate I shall have to be back at the mills the day after tomorrow."
The disappointment brought a rush of bitterness to her lips. "The day
after tomorrow? It seems hardly worth while to have come so far for two
days!"
"Oh, I don't mind the journey--and there are one or two matters I must
consult you about."
There could hardly have been a more ill-advised answer, but Amherst was
reckless now. If she cared for his coming only that he might fill a
place at a fancy-dress dinner, he would let her see that he had come
only because he had to go through the form of submitting to her certain
measures to be taken at Westmore.
Bessy was beginning to feel the physical reaction of her struggle with
the mare. The fatigue which at first had deadened her nerves now woke
them to acuter sensibility, and an appealing word from her husband would
have drawn her to his arms. But his answer seemed to drive all the blood
back to her heart.
"I don't see why you still go through the form of consulting me about
Westmore, when you have always done just as you pleased there, without
regard to me or Cicely."
Amherst made no answer, silenced by the discouragement of hearing the
same old grievance on her lips; and she too seemed struck, after she had
spoken, by the unprofitableness of such retorts.
"It doesn't matter--of course I'll do whatever you wish," she went on
listlessly. "But I could have sent my signature, if that is all you came
for----"
"Thanks," said Amherst coldly. "I shall remember that the next time."
They stood silent for a moment, he with his eyes fixed on her, she with
averted head, twisting her riding-whip between her fingers; then she
said suddenly: "We shall be late for dinner," and passing into her
dressing-room she closed the door.
Amherst roused himself as she disappeared.
"Bessy!" he exclaimed, moving toward her; but as he approached the door
he heard her maid's voice within, and turning away he went to his own
room.
       *       *       *       *       *
Bessy came down late to dinner, with vivid cheeks and an air of
improvised ease; and the manner of her entrance, combined with her
husband's unannounced arrival, produced in their observant guests the
sense of latent complications. Mr. Langhope, though evidently unaware of
his son-in-law's return till they greeted each other in the
drawing-room, was too good a card-player to betray surprise, and Mrs.
Ansell outdid herself in the delicate art of taking everything for
granted; but these very dissimulations sharpened the perception of the
other guests, whom long practice had rendered expert in interpreting
such signs.
Of all this Justine Brent was aware; and conscious also that, by every
one but herself, the suspected estrangement between the Amhersts was
regarded as turning merely on the question of money. To the greater
number of persons present there was, in fact, no other conceivable
source of conjugal discord, since every known complication could be
adjusted by means of the universal lubricant. It was this unanimity of
view which bound together in the compactness of a new feudalism the
members of Bessy Amherst's world; which supplied them with their
pass-words and social tests, and defended them securely against the
insidious attack of ideas.
