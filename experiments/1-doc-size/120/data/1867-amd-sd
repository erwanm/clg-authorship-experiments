wrong. I can't seem to make it fair to my mind. It's 
like seething a kid in its mother's milk." 

Yes." Hope's pale lips quivered. " We'll talk of it 
to-morrow. Good night, Joe. I feel tired sick." 

" Good night ; " and the two women kissed each other. 

Then Hope crept off up stairs. It seemed at first as 
if her feet would refuse to carry her. She did not even 
get a light, but in the darkness and silence found her 
way into bed, and lay there shivering and exhausted. 
It had been such a great blow. To lose confidence in 
Stephen, to think of the fearful crime he had committed 
for that paltry sum of money ! And how he had grown 



 

rich She wanted to believe it an accident, but her 
whole nature seemed to revolt against this, much as she 
loved and pitied Stephen. And that he could have 
taken her to his heart ! 

She did not sleep at all. Nearly all night she lay 
with her eyes wide open. After midnight the moon 
came up and flooded the room with its cold, pale light. 
Sometimes a fiery flash of fever tortured, her, then a 
chill, that nearly froze the blood in her veins. It 
seemed to her she lived ages in that one night. 

Joe sat by the fire. In her confused and wandering 
way she was trying to unravel the tangled web, and see 
who was right. Just now she loved Stephen with a 
sort of tigerish fierceness. To see another woman his, 
to have him lavish caresses upon her, to be put aside 
completely, was what she could not endure. Pity her, 
too. Life is so hard to some of us, and love is cruel. 

Two very strange days passed over them. They 
made talk of common occurrences ; they went through 
with their ordinary duties ; but one subject was not 
touched upon. They avoided each other's eyes, and 
somehow both came to have a guilty feeling, as if they 
were about some crime. 

On the third day Hope did not go to school as usual. 
At ten, after spending an hour in her room, she came 
down in her thick gray dress. There was a stony, 
settled expression in her face, a sinking of the lines 
about the mouth, and a dark shade under the eyes. 
Even her voice had changed. 




 

" Joe," she began, with a hollow, tremulous sound, 
"are you well enough to go out for a walk? It's a 
lovely day." 

It was bright and sunny. 

" I could." Joe glanced up wistfully. Why ? " 

"Don't ask me any questions, please. It is best for 
you not to know anything. Don't tell Stephen of our 
talk. Comfort him all you can, and make him forget 
me. And now put on your bonnet and go out for an 
hour. Just let me kiss you once. You have been so 
kind to me ! I want you to forgive me for all the pain 
and suffering I've cause'd you. I know now what it is." 

But the kiss ended in sobs. Since that fatal night 
Hope had been too deeply stunned for tears. They 
both wept. 

"O, Hope," Joe's voice was broken and repentant, 
" stay. Don't go. I'll give up all claim on Stephen. 
He may love you ; he may devote his whole life to you, 
and I'll look on, never saying a word. Only stay." 

"It isn't that, Joe. It's the insurmountable barrier 
God placed between us. I should make Stephen mis- 
erable if I staid." 

"But what will you do? " 

w It is best you should not know. At present I am 
provided for. I shall never do anything for which you 
or Stephen would be sorry. I cannot tell you more 
than that. Now you must go." 

Joe gave her a wild, beseeching look. Hope was the 



 

stronger. She brought Joe's shawl and bonnet, wrapped 
her with tender care, led her through the hall, and gave 
her one convulsive kiss. When the door closed, Hope 
groped her way back as if she had been blind. For a 
moment the whole sacrifice appeared useless. And then 
the room seemed to run with seas of crimson blood. 
A sick shudder crept over her. 

Presently, a hackman drove up to the door. Katy 
came in wide-eyed wonder. 

"You're not goin' away, Miss Hope?" 

"Yes. I want you to give this to Miss Joe, and this 
to Mr. Dane when he comes home," and she handed 
her a little packet. 

"You'm not goin' to 'lope?" and Katy started in 
affright.
