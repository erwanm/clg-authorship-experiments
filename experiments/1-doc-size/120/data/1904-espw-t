protection. 

"No," he said, " she hasn't forgotten. She 
doesn't want to sing that song." 

He caught her and crooned over her; he 
kissed her and praised her. Trixy cuddled in 
his neck quietly. She trembled and put both 
her hands in his. The little actress lived to 
pass many a merry hour upon many a little 
stage, but neither then nor thereafter could she 
be induced to join her master in that duet. 

Exhausted by her own accomplishments, or 
frightened by her darkest memories, Trixy 
played no more that day. Instead she curled 
into her master's lap and slept through a thun- 
derstorm. 

Surbridge came over when the shower was 
diminishing, and stood by Miriam, who seemed 
to him suddenly thoughtful and quiet. 

"Well? "he asked. 

When he spoke in that tone she always told 



 

him what was the matter ; she did so quite 
naturally now. 

" Phil, I 've blundered. I meant to be kind, 
but I 've blundered with those two. How do I 
know Dan hasn't minded it as well as Trixy ? 
He would be sawn asunder before he 'd let me 
know." 

" If you 've got so far as that," suggested 
Surbridge, " suppose you let me have him for 
an office boy? Trixy could sit on my table. I've 
thought for some time that doing  errands un- 
der Matthew, and running the furnace, did not 
entirely satisfy the higher nature of the lad." 

" Why didn't you say so, Phil ? Am I so 
huffy and stuffy about advice?" 

" You take advice like a philosopher — and 
the dear girl you are. I really can't say why 
I didn't. A fellow may have lucid intervals 
of modesty, I suppose — even a lawyer." 

" It needs a man," sighed Miriam, " to man- 
age a boy. I 've bungled with Dan. I dare 
say he's missed those performances as much 
as Trixy. Probably he has mourned for the 
Grand Mooses' Retreat — and Cady's Molly." 

" I doubt it," said Philip, " but we can see. 
My opinion is, the lad has missed nothing — 



except the sacred right to be a wage-earner in 
some obvious, active way — and has gained un- 
speakably and forever. But, if you choose to 
turn him over to me — as he grows older — 
I 'll try my hand at him. It 's too late, in his 
case, for what is called an education, but I can 
manage his grammar, and put a few books in 
his way/' 

" Help me, Phil," said Miriam, in a very 
low voice. " I need it. ... I need you." 

Across Surbridge's strong, controlled face 
there passed a sensitiveness that seemed to sink 
into it, and make it plastic for an expression 
which still lacked a moulding hand. 

" I thank you," he said quietly, " for that. 
You've made a lot of poor wretches happy 
to-day, including me." 

Miriam turned away. " Perhaps so — I hope 
so. But, oh, Phil, I 'm tired." 

She walked away from him, nodding and 
smiling at her guests, until she came to the 
stern of the boat, where she stood looking 
upon the wake. The little steamer was now 
heading into the harbor and the sun. The 
band was brightly playing. The deck glit- 
tered with drops of rain, and steamed. The 



 

chatter that had been subdued by the shower 
broke forth after it like birds. It had sud- 
denly grown very sultry, and Miriam threw 
off her long coat, and stood in her white flan- 
nel boating dress, tall and aloof, against the 
sky. The steamer was now leaving the rain 
and the clouds behind. 

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, two vast pris- 
matic pillars arose from the sea. Advancing, 
receding, pulsating, but ever arising, the col- 
umns of color approached each other. It was 
as if invisible hands were building out of beams 
of light a bridge for a god to cross. The rain- 
bow, seen the hundredth time, is as much a 
miracle as it was the first. Miriam's poor peo- 
ple broke into simple cries of wonder and de- 
light ; but these hushed into low exclamations,
