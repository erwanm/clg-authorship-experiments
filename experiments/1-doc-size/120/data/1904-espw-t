had come into her eyes again. She tripped 
down the aisle on her hind feet. Mockingly 
she paused before Cady's Molly, flinging as 
she did so a roguish glance at her master. 
The audience had grown very still. Dan did 



 

not interfere. After a moment's hesitation 
Trixy turned her back on Molly, walked to 
Miss Lauriat, sprang into her lap, and put 
both paws around the young lady's neck. 
Tumultuous applause attested the popularity of 
the dog's choice. 

Cries came from different parts of the 
room : 

" Speech ! Speech ! The Lady ! The Lady ! " 

Mrs. Percy B. Jeffries bit her lips; but 
Miss Lauriat graciously responded. It was 
not the first time she had been on the plat- 
form of that hall, and had helped the people's 
entertainments. They all loved her, and she 
knew it. She was quite at home with them. 
With the little dog clinging to her neck, 
white against her black dress, Miriam went 
up and stood beside the crippled lad. In that 
dull place she was a radiant being. She illu- 
mined the dark background of that paltry 
stage as she had illumined the dark lives 
which found their best — perhaps their purest 
— pleasures in amusements such as this. 

For a moment she stood there smiling, the 
little creature cuddling in her neck — both 
silent. The face of the dog could not be 



 

seen, and its child's dress and infantile 
attitude gave a strange impression, as if some 
new Madonna, gently owning her kinship to 
the subject races, had arisen to protect them. 

At first, Miriam thought she would have 
said a few words, but the cold eyes of Olin 
Steele were fixed upon her. Something in 
their expression deterred her ; she could not 
have said why. She felt a little chilled, as 
if he did not approve of her position. She 
bowed, and gave the dog back to Dan. 

But the audience, rinding that there was to 
be no speech from Miss Lauriat, and unwill- 
ing to be cheated out of their rights and 
privileges in the lady, thronged towards the 
platform. 

Philip Surbridge, however, was there first. 
His face was warm with sympathy. The finer 
meaning of that evening's scene appealed to 
every fibre in his being. He felt it all with 
her. He felt it all for her. He grasped her 
hand with the enthusiasm of a boy and the 
reverence of a man. 

" You have done a beautiful thing," he 
said, " and I honor you for it ! " 

He stood beside her for a moment, in a pro- 



 

tecting attitude, like a brother's, between her 
and the people who were hurrying up the steps. 

" Thank you, Phil," she said in a low voice. 
" But I Ve got to shake hands with them. It 
would break their hearts if I didn't. Speak 
to Dan, please, and then we 'll go." 

" Dan," said Surbridge, " if ever you and 
Trixy want a friend, count on me." 

He held out his hand heartily, first to Dan, 
and then to the pretty dog. Then Dan put 
on Trixy's blue coat (it was embroidered with 
her name) lest she should take cold after the 
excitement of the performance, and led the 
little actress away. 

Professor Steele did not come up with the 
remainder of Miss Lauriat's party. He stood 
for a moment watching her, while fifty people 
grasped her delicate hand. Cady's Molly's 
father was one of them. The scene was for- 
eign to Olin's experience. He had experi- 
mented upon the poor ; he had meant to be 
kind to them ; sometimes he had cured them ; 
but he had not been their friend. He was by 
no means sure that he wanted to be, or 
wanted her to be. He envied the look of gen- 
uine appreciation on Surbridge's face — that 



 

spontaneous sympathy with this extraordinary 
situation. Deterred by a discomfort in him- 
self which he did not understand, the doctor 
took his hat and left the hall.
