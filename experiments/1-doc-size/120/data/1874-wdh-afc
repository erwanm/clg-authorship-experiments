Some few succeed, and then they have lawsuits 
with the infringers of their patents ; some sell out 
their inventions for a trifle to companies that have 
capital, and that grow rich upon them ; the great 
number can never bring their ideas to the public 
notice at all. You can judge for yourself what 
your chances would be. You have asked me why 
you should not go to America. Well, because I 
think you would starve there." 

" I am used to that," said Don Ippolito ; " and 
besides, until some of my inventions became known, 
I could give lessons in Italian." 

" Oh, bravo I " said Ferris, " you prefer instant 
death, then?" 

" But madamigella seemed to believe that my 
success as an inventor would be assured, there." 

Ferris gave a very ironical laugh. " Miss Ver 
vain must have been about twelve years old when 
she left America. Even a lady's knowledge of busi 
ness, at that age, is limited. When did yon talk 



 

with her about it ? You had not spoken of it to 
me, of late, and I thought you were more contented 
than you used to be." 

" It is true," said the priest. u Sometimes within 
the last two months I have almost forgotten it." 

" And what has brought it so forcibly to your 
mind again ? " 

" That is what I so greatly desire to tell you," 
replied Don Ippolito, with an appealing look at the 
painter's face. He moistened his parched lips a 
little, waiting for further question from the painter, 
to whom he seemed a man fevered by some strong 
emotion and at that moment not quite wholesome. 
Ferris did not speak, and Don Ippolito began 
again : " Even though I have not said so in words 
to you, dear friend, has it not appeared to you that 
I have no heart in my vocation ? " 

" Yes, I have sometimes fancied that. I had no 
right to ask you why." 

" Some day I will tell you, when I have the 
courage to go all over it again. It is partly my 
own fault, but it is more my miserable fortune. 
But wherever the wrong lies, it has at last become 
intolerable to me. I cannot endure it any longer 
and live. I must go away, I must fly from it." 

Ferris shrank from him a little, as men instinc 
tively do from one who has set himself upon some 
desperate attempt. " Do you mean, Don Ippolito, 
that you are going to renounce your priesthood ? " 

Don Ippolito opened his hands and let his priest 
hood drop, as it were, to the ground. 



 

" You never spoke of this before, when you talked 
of going to America. Though to be sure " 

" Yes, yes ! " replied Don Ippolito with vehe 
mence, " but now an angel has appeared and shown 
me the blackness of my life ! " 

Ferris began to wonder if he or Don Ippolito 
were not perhaps mad. 

" An angel, yes," the priest went on, rising from 
his chair, " an angel whose immaculate truth has 
mirrored my falsehood in all its vileness and distor 
tion to whom, if it destroys me, I cannot devote 
less than a truthfulness like hers ! " 

" Hers hers ? " cried the painter, with a sudden 
pang. " Whose ? don 't speak in these riddles. 
Whom do you mean ? " 

" Whom can I mean but only one ? madami- 
gella ! " 

" Miss Vervain? Do you mean to say that Miss 
Vervain has advised you to renounce your priest 
hood?" 

" In as many ..words she has bidden rne forsake it 
at any risk, at the cost of kindred, friends, good 
fame, country, everything." 

The painter passed his hand confusedly over his 
face. These were his own words, the words he had 
used in speaking with Florida of the supposed skep 
tical priest. He grew very pale. " May I ask," 
he demanded in a hard, dry voice, u how she came 
to advise such a step ? " 

" I can hardly tell. Something had already 



 

moved her to learn from me the story of my life 
to know that I was a man with neither faith nor 
hope. Her pure heart was torn by the thought of 
my wrong and of my error. I had never seen my
