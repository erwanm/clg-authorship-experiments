His hand had loosened, and Gray got up, turn- 
ing a face now flushed and a little disordered 
from one of them to the other. "I don't pre- 
tend to understand anything!" 

It turned his uncle to their companion. "Isn't 
he fine?" 

"Of course he's fine," said Miss Goodenough; 
"but you've quite worn him out." 

"Have I quite worn you out?" Mr. Better- 
man calmly inquired. 

As if indeed finished, each thumb now in a 




 

pocket of his trousers, the young man dimly- 
smiled. "I think you must have — quite." 

"Well, let Miss Mumby look after you. He'll 
find her there?" his uncle asked of her colleague. 
And then as the latter showed at this her first 
indecision, "Isn't she somewhere round?" he 
demanded. 

Miss Goodenough had wavered, but as if it 
really mattered for the friend there present she 
responsibly concluded. "Well, no — just for a 
while." And she appealed to Gray's indulgence. 
"She's had to go to Mr. Gaw." 

"Why, is Mr. Gaw sick?" Mr. Betterman 
asked with detachment. 

"That's what we shall know when she comes 
back; She'll come back all right," she continued 
for Gray's encouragement. 

He met it with proper interest. "I'm sure I 
hope so!" 

"Well, don't be too sure !" his uncle judiciously 
said. 

"Oh he has only borrowed her." Miss Good- 
enough smoothed it down even as she smoothed 
Mr. Betterman's sheet, while with the same move- 
ment of her head she wafted Gray to the door. 

"Mr. Gaw," her patient returned, "has bor- 
rowed from me before. Mr. Gaw, Graham !" 

"Yes sir?" said Gray with the door ajar and 
his hand on the knob. 

The fine old presence on the pillow had faltered 


 

before expression; then it appeared rather sigh- 
ingly and finally to give the question up. "Well, 
Mr. Gaw's an abyss." 

Gray found himself suddenly responsive. "Isn't 
he, the strange man ? " 

"The strange man — that's it." This summary 
description sufficed now to Mr. Betterman's 
achieved indifference. "/But you've seen him?" 

"Just for an instant." 

"And that was enough?" 

"Well, I don't know." Gray himself gave it 
up. "You're all so fiercely interesting!" 

"I think Rosanna's lovely!" Miss Goodenough 
contributed, to all appearance as an attenuation, 
while she tucked their companion in. 

"Oh Miss Gaw's quite another matter," our 
young man still paused long enough to reply. 

"Well, I don't mean but what she's interest- 
ing in her way too," Miss Good enough's con- 
science prompted. 

' "Oh he knows all about her. That's all right," 
Mr. Betterman remarked for his nurse's benefit. 

"Why of course I know it," this lady candidly 
answered. "Miss Mumby and I have had to 
feel that. I guess he'll want to send her his love," 
she continued across to Gray. 

"To Miss Mumby?" asked Gray, his general 
bewilderment having moments of aggravation. 

"Why no — she's sure of his affection. To 
Miss Gaw. Don't you want," she inquired of 





 

her patient, "to send your love to that poor 
anxious girl ? " 

"Is she anxious?" Gray returned in advance 
of his uncle.
