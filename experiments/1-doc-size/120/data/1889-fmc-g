had turned away and appeared to be examining one of the guns 
that stood in a rack against the wall. The meeting had taken 
place in the great hall, and he was glad that there was something 
to look at, for he did not know whether he was most amused by 
his mother's chatter, or ashamed of the ridiculous figure she made. 
The impression was certainly a painful one, and he had not attained 
to his father's grim indifference, for he was not obliged to assist 
daily at such scenes. He could not help comparing Hilda's mother 
with his own, and he inwardly determined that when he was 
married he would take up his abode at Sigmundskron during the 
greater part of the year. 
Hilda looked at her hostess and wondered whether all women 
of the world were like Frau von Greifenstein. The situation did 
not last long, however, and half an hour later she found herself 
sitting beside Greif on a block of stone by the ruined Hunger-Thurm. 
' At last ! ' exclaimed Greif, with a sigh of satisfaction. ' Is 
there anything so tiresome as the sight of affectionate greetings ? ' 
' Greif ' Hilda paused, as though reconsidering the question 
she was about to ask. 
' Yes what is it, sweetheart ? ' 
' When we are married, I must love your mother, must I not ? ' 
' Oh yes no doubt,' answered the young man with a puzzled 
expression. ' At least, I suppose you must try.' 
' But I mean, if I do not love her as much as my own mother, 
will it be very wrong ? ' 
' No, not so much, of course/ 
' Do you love her, Greif? ' 
' Oh yes,' replied Greif cheerfully. ' Not as I love you ' 
'Or your father?' 
' That is different, a man feels more sympathy for his father, 
because he is a man.' 
' But I am not a man 
'No, and you are not my mother either. That is again 
different, you see.' 
' Greif you do not love your mother at all ! ' exclaimed Hilda, 
turning her bright eyes to his. But he looked away and his face 
grew grave. 
'Please do not say that to me, dear,' he answered quietly. 
' Let us talk of other things.' 
' Does it pain you ? I am sorry. I asked you because well, 
I wanted to know if it was exactly my duty because you see, I 
do not think I ever could, quite, as I ought to. You are not 
angry ? ' 
' No, darling. Fquite understand. It will be enough if you behave to her as you do now. Besides, I was going to propose something, if your mother will agree to it. When we are married, 
we might live at Sigmundskron.' 
' Oh ! Greif, are you in earnest ? ' 
'Yes. Why not ]' 
' You do not know what a place it is ! ' exclaimed Hilda with 
an uneasy laugh. She had visions of her husband discovering the 
 
utter desolation of the old castle, but at the same time she felt a 
sudden wild desire to see it all restored and furnished and kept up 
as it should be. 
' Yes, I know. But there are many reasons why I should like 
it. Of course it has gone to ruin, more or less, and there would 
be something to be done.' 
' Something ! ' cried Hilda. * Everything ! The great rooms are 
perfectly desolate, no furniture, hardly any glass in the windows. 
We are so poor, Greif ! ' 
' But I can put panes into the frames and get some furniture. 
We need not have so much at first.' 
'But you will have to get everything, everything. You are 
used to so much here.' 
' I should not need much if I had you/ answered Greif looking 
at her, as the colour rose in his own face. 
'I do not know. Perhaps not.' 
I should be happy with you in a woodman's hut,' said Greif 
earnestly. 
' Perhaps,' replied Hilda a little doubtfully. 
 There is no "perhaps." I am quite sure of it.' 
' How can you be sure ? ' asked the young girl turning suddenly 
and laying her hands upon his arm. ' Did not your father say the 
same no, forgive me ! I will not speak of that. Oh Greif ! 
What is love really the meaning of it, the true spirit of it 
Why does it sometimes last and sometimes not *? Are all men so 
different one from another, and women too ? Is it not like religion, 
that when you once believe you always believe ? I have thought 
about it so much, and I cannot understand it. And yet I know I 
love you. Why can I not understand what I feel ? Is it very 
foolish of me ? Am I less clever than other girls ? ' 
' No, indeed ! ' Greif drew her to him, and kissed her cheek. 
Her colour never changed. With innocent simplicity she turned 
her face and kissed him in return. 
'Then why is it  ?' she asked. 'And none of my books tell me 
what it means, though I have read them all. Can you not tell 
me, you who know so much ? What is the use of all your studies 
and your universities, if you cannot tell me what it is I feel, what 
love is . ' 
'Does love need explanation? What does the meaning matter, 
when one has it ? ' 
' Ah, you may say that of anything. Would the air be sweeter, 
if I knew what it was ? Would the storm be louder, or grander, 
or more angry, if I knew what made it ? And besides, I do know, 
 
for I have learned about storms in my books. But it is not the 
same thing. Love is not part of nature, I am sure. It is a part 
of the soul. But then, why should it sometimes change? The 
soul does not change, for it is eternal.' 
' But true love does not change either ' 
'And yet people seem to think it is true, until it changes,' 
argued Hilda. * There must be something by which one can tell 
whether it is true or not.' 
' One must not be too logical with love, any more than with 
religion.' 
' Religion ? Why, that is the most logical thing we know any- 
thing about ! ' 
' And yet people have differed very much in their opinions of 
it,' said Greif with a smile. 
' Is it not logical that good people should go to heaven and bad 
people to hell ? ' inquired Hilda calmly. ' Religion would be 
illogical if it taught that sinners should all be saved and saints 
burnt in everlasting fire. How can you say it is not logical ? ' 
'It certainly cannot be said if one takes your view,' Greif 
answered, laughing. ' But then, if you look at love in the same 
way, you get the same result. People who love each other are 
happy and people who quarrel are not.' 
' Yes ; but then, love does not only consist in not quarrelling.' 
' Nor religion in not being a sinner but I am not sure 
Greif interrupted himself. ' Perhaps that is just what religion 
means.'
