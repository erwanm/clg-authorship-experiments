how bad I am ; whereas with you he knows the worst." 

Of this observation Mrs. Brook, whose eyes attached 
themselves again to Mr. Longdon, took at first no further 
notice than might have been indicated by the way it set 
her musing. " ' Calculating'?" — she at last took him up. 
" On what is there to calculate ?" 

" Why," said Vanderbank, " if, as you just hinted, he's 
a blessing in disguise — ! I perfectly admit," he resumed, 
"that I'm capable of sacrifices to keep on good terms 
with him." 

" You're not afraid he'll bore you ?" 

"Oh yes— distinctly." 

" But it will be worth it ? Then," Mrs. Brook said, 
as he appeared to assent, "it will be worth a great deal." 
She continued to watch Mr. Longdon, who, without his 
glasses, stared straight at the floor while Mr. Cashmore 
talked to him. She pursued, however, dispassionately 
enough : "He must be of a narrowness — !" 

" Oh, beautiful !" 

She was silent again. "I shall broaden him. You 
won't." 

"Heaven forbid!" Vanderbank heartily concurred. 
"But none the less, as I've said, I'll help you." 

Her attention was still fixed. "It will be him you'll 
help. If you're to make sacrifices to keep on good terms 
with him, the first sacrifice will be of me." Then on his 
leaving this remark so long unanswered that she had 
finally looked at him again-: "I'm perfectly prepared fof 
it." 

It was as if, jocosely enough, he had had time to make 





  

lip his mind how to meet her. "What will you have — 
when he loved my mother ?" 

Nothing conld have been droller than the gloom of her 
surprise. "Yours too ?" 

"I didn't tell you the other day — out of delicacy." 

Mrs. Brookenham darkly thought. ''He didn't tell 
me either." 

" The same consideration deterred him. But if I didn't 
speak of it/' Vanderbank continued, " when I arranged 
with you, after meeting him here at dinner, that you 
should come to tea with him at my rooms — if I didn't 
mention it then it wasn't because I hadn't learnt it 
early." 

Mrs. Brook more deeply sounded this affair, but she 
spoke with the exaggerated mildness which was the form 
her gaiety mostly took. " It was because, of course, it 
makes him out such a wretch ! What becomes in that 
case of his loyalty — ?" 

 ' To your mother's memory ? Oh, it's all right — he 
has it quite clear. She came later — mine, after my fa- 
ther's death, had refused him. But, you see, he might 
have been my step-father." 

Mrs. Brookenham took it in, but she had suddenly a 
brighter light. "He might have been my own father ! 
Besides," she went on, " if his line is to love the mothers, 
why on earth doesn't he love me? I'm in all conscience 
enough of one." 

"Ah, but isn't there in your case the fact of a daugh- 
ter ?" Vanderbank asked with a slight embarrassment. 

Mrs. Brookenham stared. "What good does that do 
me ?" 

"Why, didn't she tell you ?" 

"Nanda ? She told me he doesn't like her any better 
than he likes me." 

Vanderbank, in his turn, showed surprise. "That's 
really what she said ?" 





 

" She had on her return from your rooms a most un- 
usual fit of frankness, for she generally tells me nothing/  

''Well," said Vanderbank, "how did she put it ?" 

Mrs. Brook reflected — recovered it. "'I like him 
awfully, but Tm not in the least Ids idea.'" 

" His idea of what ?" 

''That's just what I asked her. Of the proper grand- 
child for mamma." 

Vanderbank hesitated. "Well, she isn't." Then after 
another pause: "But she ll do." 

His companion gave him a deep look. " You'll make 
her ?"
