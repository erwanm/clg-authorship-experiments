training asserted itself with power, and wrought with 
strong influence upon his mind and heart. He put his 
old life behind him and became an earnest Christian. 
Some ladies in the town heard of this, visited him, and 
by their encouraging words supported him in his good 
resolutions and strengthened him to continue in his 
new life. The trial ended in his conviction and sen- 
tence to the State prison for the term of nine years, as 
I have before said. In the prison he became acquainted 
with the poor wretch referred to in the beginning of 
my talk, Jack Hunt, the writer of the letter which I 
am going to read. You will see that the acquaintance- 
ship bore fruit for Hunt. When Hunt’s time was out, 
he wandered to St. Louis; and from that place he 
wrote his letter to Williams. The letter got no 
further than the office of the prison warden, of course; 
prisoners are not often allowed to receive letters from 
outside. The prison authorities read this letter, but 
did not destroy it. They had not the heart to do it. 
They read it to several persons, and eventually it fell 
into the hands of those ladies of whom I spoke a while 
ago. The other day I came across an old friend of 
mine — a clergyman — who had seen this letter, and 
was full of it. The mere remembrance of it so moved 
him that he could not talk of it without his voice 
breaking. He promised to get a copy of it for me; 
and here it is — an exact copy, with all the imperfec- 
tions of the original preserved. It has many slang ex- 
pressions in it — thieves 5 argot — but their meaning 
has been interlined, in parentheses, by the prison 
authorities : 
St. Louis, June 9th, 1872. 
Mr. W friend Charlie if i may call you so : i no you are surprised 
to get a letter from me, but i hope you won’t be mad at my writing to you. 
i want to tell you my thanks for the way you talked to me when i was in 
prison — it has led me to try and be a better man; i guess you thought i did 
not cair for what you said, & at the first go off i did n’t, but i noed you was 
a man who had don big work with good men & want no sucker, nor want 
gasing & all the boys knod it. 
I used to think at nite what you said, & for it i nocked off swearing 5 
months before my time was up, for i saw it want no good, nohow — the 
day my time was up you told me if i would shake the cross ( quit stealing), 
& live on the square for 3 months, it would be the best job i ever done in my 
Jife. The state agent give me a ticket to here, & on the car i thought more of 
what you said to me, but didn’t make up my mind. When we got to Chicago 
m the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old woman’s leather {robbed her 
of her pocket-book) ; i had n’t no more than got it off when i wished i had n’t 
done it, for awhile before that i made up my mind to be a square bloke, for 
3 months on your word, but i forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip 
{easy to get) — but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a 
way place i said, marm have you lost anything? & she tumbled {dis- 
covered) her leather was of {gone) — is this it says i, giving it to her — 
well if you aint honest, says she, but i had n’t got cheak enough to stand 
that sort of talk, so i left 'her in a hurry. When i got here i had $1 and 25 
cents left & i didn’t get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust 
about on a steam bote {for a deck hand ) — The afternoon of the 3d day I 
spent my last 10 cents for 2 moons {large, round sea biscuit) & cheese & i 
felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe {picking 
pockets) again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling 
on the Lord when he was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once 
anyhow, but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get oft 
wos, Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ’s 
sake, amen; & i kept a thinking of it over and over as i went along— about 
an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of 
my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done 
writing. As i was walking along i herd a big noise & saw a horse running 
away with a carriage with 2 children in it, and i grabed up a peace of box 
cover from the sidewalk & run in the middle of the street, & when the horse 
came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive — the bord 
split to peces & the horse checked up a little & i grabbed the reigns & pulled 
his head down until he stopped — the gentleman what owned him came 
running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook hands 
with me & gave me a $50 green back, & my asking the Lord to help me 
come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i could n’t drop the reigns nor 
say nothing — he saw something was up, & coming back to me said, my 
boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my head just then to ask him 
for work; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job — says he, 
jump in here & lets talk about it, but keep the money — he asked me if i 
could take care of horses & i said yes, for i used to hang round livery 
stables & often would help clean & drive horses, he told me he wanted a 
man for that work, & would give me $16. a month & bord me. You bet 
i took that chance at once, that nite in my little room over the stable i sat 
a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just 
got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square 
It, & to bless you for putting me up to it, & the next morning i done it 
again & got me some new togs (clothes) & a bible for i made up my ?nind 
after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and 
morning, & ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there about 
a week Mr Brown (that’s his name) came in my room one nite & saw me 
reading the bible — he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no — he 
asked me how it wasi read the bible instead of papers & books — Well 
Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start, so i told 
him all about my being in prison & about you, & how i had almost done 
give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when x asked him; 
& the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it, & 
i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months — he talked to me like a 
father for a long time, & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever 
i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now 
i did n’t fear no one giving me a back cap ( exposing his past life) & running 
me off the job — the next morning he called me into the library & gave me 
another square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would 
help me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling 
book, a Geography & and a writing book, & he hers me every nite — he 
lets me come into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a 
bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to 
understand my bible better. 
Now, Charlie the 3 months on the square are up 2 months ago, & as 
you said, it is the best job i ever did in my life, & i commenced another of 
the same sort right away, only it is to God helping me to last a lifetime 
Charlie — i wrote this letter to tell you i do think God has forgiven my sins 
& herd your prayers, for you told me you should pray for me — i no i love 
to read his word & tell him all my troubles & he helps me i know for i have 
plenty of chances to steal but i don’t feel to as i once did & now i take more 
pleasure in going to church than to the theatre & that wasn’t so once 
— our minister and others often talk with me & a month ago they wanted 
me to join the church, but i said no, not now, i may be mistaken in my 
feelings, i will wait awhile, but now i feel that God has called me & on the 
first Sunday in July i will join the church — dear friend i wish i could write 
to you as i feel, but i cant do it yet — you no i learned to read and write 
while in prisons & i aint got well enough along to write as i would talk; i
