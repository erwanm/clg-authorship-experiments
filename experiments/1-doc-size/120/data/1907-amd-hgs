affords me sincere gratification to meet you 
again. I was afraid I would have to wait for 
commencement." 

Then he turned courteously to the other 
group and was introduced. There was an 
agreeable confusion of voices, and strictures 
on the air that was sharp and biting, much 
running to and fro, doffing coats and wraps, 
and finding on their return an inviting circle 
of chairs in which they were requested to 
seat themselves. Mr. Morse proved quite 
equal to their entertainment, for in a few mo- 
ments he had them all talking, and then he 
found himself listening with interest to an 
account of their Christmas fun. 




“ Do you have to get up new things every 
year to surprise each other?” he asked. 
“ We are settled upon Christmas-trees, but it 
is hard sometimes to remember what you gave 
a boy or girl last year.” 

“ It is the first Christmas I ever spent here,” 
said Lorraine. “ And I really did enjoy it 
wonderfully. But you are not compelled to 
do anything for the pleasure or gratification 
of those who stay, are you, Miss Morse? ” 

“ Why, no ! But I think it was very good 
of you girls,” was the answer. “ This is only 
the second Christmas I have spent here. On 
the first occasion, we had a grand concert." 

They were summoned to tea, and as Leslie 
said, when they dispersed for the night, they 
might have known Mr. Morse for years, he 
was so social and cast about so little restraint. 
They had not hesitated to compare college 
life, and he had recounted some of his own 
experiences which were very amusing. 

“ He certainly is delightful,” Juliet said en- 
thusiastically. “ I was sorry at first to see 
him, we were so cosy and chatty, just girls 
together. He has so few mannerisms; he 




doesn't seem at all afraid you will not pay 
respect to his clerical position, but he makes 
his standing as a Christian gentleman so de- 
cided, no one can mistake it. That is what I 
liked about him at Hope.” 

Helen studied Juliet, who was folding laces 
in her careful way. She was dainty and or- 
derly about everything. There was an enthu- 
siasm in her tone that Helen never remem- 
bered being used about a man before. Was 
she unconscious of it? 

The lieutenant came the next day. He was 
a bright, breezy fellow, with a round, rosy 
face, clear blue eyes, and ready for a laugh 
at the slightest provocation. He had been 
reared in his cousin’s family, where now the 
two older girls were married, and he and Mar- 
garet were great chums. In an hour he had 
affiliated with all the girls, except Shirley, 
who was seized with an unaccountable fit of 
shyness. 

They planned what they should do. There 
was splendid skating on a pond with a wind- 
ing creek half a mile off, and there was a 
small house of rest, kept nice and warm, where 


  

one could get a cup of coffee or tea and a 
sandwich, and also hire skates. 

Miss Morse did not skate ; neither did 
Shirley, though she was learning. 

“ I'd rather stay at home with the piano,” 
she said. 

“ The lieutenant and I will take good care 
of the girls, Margaret ; you need not worry. 
If they fall in the pond I am quite sure we can 
fish them out. I have done it before." 

“ Oh, no, Mr. Morse! We never went out 
skating before, and I never have fallen in,” 
laughed Leslie. 

“ I stand corrected.” He made a very low 
bow. “ But we are at your service, even on 
the slightest tumble.” 

“ Will you go down to the noon train and 
see if Mr. Bell is there?” Helen begged of 
Miss Morse, who assented cheerfully. 

They went off in a merry mood. Shirley 
and Miss Morse spent a nice hour getting 
better acquainted, then had a pleasant walk, 
but no young man came on the train. Shirley 
was rather pleased, as they went to Music
