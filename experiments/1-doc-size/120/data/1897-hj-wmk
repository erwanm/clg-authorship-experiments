Mrs. Beale once more gathered in her 
little charge, holding her close and looking 
thoughtfully over her head at their visitor. 
"It 's so charming for a man of your type 
to have wanted her so much ! " 

" What do you know about my type ? " Sir 
Claude inquired. "Whatever it may be, I 
dare say it deceives you. The truth about 
me is simply that I 'm the most unappreciated 
of what do you call the fellows? * family 





men.' Yes, I 'm a family man; upon my 
honor I am ! " 

"Then why on earth," cried Mrs. Beale, 
"didn't you marry a family woman?" 

Sir Claude looked at her hard. " You 
know whom one marries, I think. Besides, 
there are no family women hanged if there 
are! None of them want any children 
hanged if they do!" 

His account of the matter was most inter- 
esting, and Maisie, a's if it were of bad omen 
for her, stared at the picture in some dismay. 
At the same time she felt, through encircling 
arms, her protectress hesitate. "You do 
come out with things ! But you mean her 
ladyship doesn't want any really?" 

"Won't hear of them simply. But she 
can't help the one she has got." And with 
this Sir Claude's eyes rested on the little 
girl in a way that seemed to her to mask her 
mother's attitude with the consciousness of 
her own. " She must make the best of her, 
don't you see? If only for the look of the 
thing, don't you know, one wants one's wife 
to take the proper line about her child." 

" Oh, I know what one wants ! " Mrs. 
Beale declared with a competence that evi- 
dently impressed her interlocutor. 





" Well, if you keep him up and I dare 
say you've had worry enough why should n't 
I keep Ida? What 's sauce for the goose is 
sauce for the gander or the other way 
round, don't you know ? I mean to see the 
thing through." 

Mrs. Beale, for a minute, still with her 
eyes on him as he leaned upon the chimney- 
piece, appeared to turn this over. " You 're 
just a wonder of kindness that 's what you 
are ! " she said at last. " A lady 's expected 
to have natural feelings. But your horrible 
sex isn't it a horrible sex, little love?" 
she demanded with her cheek upon her 
step-daughter's. 

"Oh, I like gentlemen best," Maisie 
lucidly replied. 

The words were taken up merrily. " That 's 
a good one for you ! " Sir Claude exclaimed 
to Mrs. Beale. 

"No," said that lady; "I 've only to re- 
member the women she sees at her mother's. " 

"Ah, they 're very nice now," Sir Claude 
returned. 

"What do you call nice?" 

"Well, they 're all right." 

"That doesn't answer me," said Mrs. 
Beale ; " but I dare say you do take care of 





them. That makes you more of an angel to 
want this job too." She playfully whacked 
her smaller companion. 

"I'm not an angel I'm an old grand- 
mother," Sir Claude declared; "I like babies; 
I always did. If we go to smash I shall 
look for a place as a ' responsible nurse. ' " 

Maisie, in her charmed mood, drank in an 
imputation on her years which at another 
moment might have been bitter; but the 
charm was sensibly interrupted by Mrs. 
Beale's screwing her round and gazing 
fondly into her eyes. "You're willing to 
leave me, you wretch ? " 

The little girl deliberated ; even her 
attachment to this bright presence had 
become as a cord she must suddenly snap. 
But she snapped it very gently. " Is n't it 
my turn for mamma ? " 

" You 're a horrible little hypocrite ! The 
less, I think, now said about ' turns ' the
