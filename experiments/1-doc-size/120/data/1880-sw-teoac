into any great excesses; or if he did, they were 
hidden from Dolly; but he indulged himself, she 
knew, in one at least of his mischievous pleasures. 
She had no reason to suppose that he gambled; as 
I said, there was always money to discharge the 
weekly bills; but he found wine somewhere and 
drank it; that was certain; and when did ever 



 

evil habits stand still ? If he kept within bounds 
now, who should warrant her that he would continue to do so ? Mr. Copley came home sometimes 
cheerful and disposed to be merry; he had taken 
only enough to exhilarate him ; at other times he 
came home gloomy and cross, and then Dolly 
knew he had drunk enough to confuse his head 
and slightly disturb his conscience. What could 
she do ? She clenched her little hands sometimes 
when she was walking the streets, and sometimes 
she wrung them, in impotent grief. She strove to 
win her father to share in her pleasures; with little success. She was lovely to him as a daughter 
could be, always ; and at the same time she let him 
see by her grave face and subdued manner when 
he came home with the breath of wine upon his 
lips, that she was troubled and grieved. What 
more coulcl she do ? So her winter was a complication of great enjoyment with anxiety and mortification. 

About the end of March they left the delightful 
old city and set off southwards. To Sorrento, was 
Dolly's fond hope. But when they got to Naples, 
she found that all the men of the party were against 
proceeding further, at least before the pleasures and 
novelties of that place had also bean tasted. 

"There's a famous museum here, Dolly," said 
her father. " You could not pass that ? " 

" And Pompeii don't you want to see Pompeii ? " 
cried Rupert. 

"It will be pleasanter at Sorrento later in the 



 

season," said Lawrence ; " much pleasanter. Wait 
till it grows warm here; then Sorrento will be delightful. We are taking everything just at the 
right time." 

" And it is as beautiful here as you can find anything," added Mr. Copley. " You want to look at 
the bay of Naples, now you have the chance." 

Yes, said Dolly to herself, and they say the wines 
are good at Naples too ! But she gave up the question. They established themselves in a hotel. 

" For how long, I wonder ? " said Mrs. Copley to 
Dolly when they were alone. "It seems as if I 
wasn't going to get to Sorrento. I don't know 
what I expect there, either, I am sure ; only we set 
out to go to Sorrento for my health; and here we 
are in Naples after five months of wandering and 
lounging about ! and here we are going to stay, it 
seems." 

"The wandering and lounging about was very 
good for you, mother dear. You are a great deal 
improved in your looks." 

" I wish I was in my feelings." 

" You are, aren't you ? " 

" What does your father want to do in Naples ? " 

"I don't know. They all want to stay here a 
while, you see. And mother, don't you enjoy this 
wonderful view ? " For their windows commanded 
the bay. 

" I'd rather see Boston harbour, by half." 

" so would I ! on some accounts. But mother, 
it is a great thing to see Naples." 



 

"So your father thinks. Men never do know 
what they want; only it is always something they 
haven't got." 

" We're in Naples, though, mother." 

"We shan't be long." 

" Well we don't want to be here long, mother." 

" I'd like to be still somewheres. Your father'd 
as lieve be anywheres else as at home ; but I like 
to see my own fire burn. I don' know as I ever 
shall, again. Unless you'll marry Mr. St. Leger, 
Dolly. That would bring all right, at one stroke." 

From which suggestion Dolly always escaped as 
fast as possible. 

It turned out that they were to stay a good while 
at Naples. Perhaps Mr. Copley feared the seclusion 
of a private house at Sorrento. However that were, 
he seemed to find motives to dftain him where he 
was, and Lawrence St. Leger was nothing loth. 
The days went by, till Dolly herself grew impatient. They went very much after the former manner, as far as the gentlemen were concerned; Lawrence found society, and Mr. Copley too, naturally, 
took pleasure in meeting a good many people to 
whom he was known. What other pleasure he 
took in their company Dolly could but guess; with 
him things went on very much as they had done in
