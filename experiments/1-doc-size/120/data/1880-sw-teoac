not be encouraged, while at the same time he could 



 

not be sent away. At least, not yet. Careful, and 
cool, and womanly, she must be; and that was not 
so very difficult, for poor Dolly felt as if glad childish days were past for her. 

Another question was, how she should get the 
most good of her journey, and how she could help 
Rupert, who she could see was on the watch to 
improve himself. Dolly had a sympathy for him. 
She resolved that she would study up every subject that presented itself, and set Rupert upon 
doing the same. St. Leger might take care of 
himself. Yet Dolly's conscience would not let 
him go so. No; one can be nobody's travelling 
companion for days or weeks, without having 
duties to fulfil towards him; but Dolly thought 
the duties were very difficult in this her particular 
case. If her father would but come ! And therewith Dolly sat down and wrote him the tenderest, lovingest of letters, telling him about their 
journey, and the glass windows; and begging 
him to meet them in Dresden or before, so that 
they might see the fabulous Green vaults together. 
In any case, she begged him to make such provision that Mrs. Copley might not be disappointed 
of seeing them. All Dolly's eloquence and some 
tears were poured out upon that sheet of paper; 
and as she sealed it up she felt again that she 
was surely growing to be a woman ; the days of 
her childhood were gone. 

Not so far off however, but that Dolly's spirits 
sprang up again after the letter was despatched, 



 

and were able to take exquisite pleasure in everything the further journey offered. Even the un- 
attractive was novel, and what was not unattractive was so charming. She admired the quaint, 
clean, bright, fanciful Dutch towns; the abundance 
of flowers still to be seen abroad ; the smiling country places surrounding the towns; the strange 
carvings and devices on the houses; the crooked 
streets. 

"You are the first person I ever saw," Lawrence 
said admiringly, "who found beauty in crooked 
streets." 

" Do you like straight ones ? " said Dolly. 

" Certainly. Why not ? " 

"You look from end to, end; you see all there 
is at once ; walk and walk as you may, there is no 
change, but the same wearisome lines of houses. 
Now when streets are not straight, but have windings and turnings, you are always coming to something new." 

" I suppose you like them to be up hill and down 
too ? " 

" very much ! " 

" You do not find that in Holland." 

"No, but in Boston." 

" Ah, indeed ! " said Lawrence. 

" I wonder," Dolly went on, " what makes one 
nation so different from another. You are on an 
island ; but here there is only a line between Holland and Germany, and the people are not alike." 

" Comes from what they eat," said Lawrence. 



 

" Their food ? " said Dolly. 

"Yes. The Scotchman lives upon porridge, the 
Englishman on beef and porter, the German on 
sausages and beer." 

"The French?" 

" 0, on soup and salad and sour wine." 

" And Italians ? " 

" On grapes and olives." 

"That will do to talk about," said Dolly; "but 
it does not touch the question." 

" Not touch the question ! I beg your pardon 
but it does touch it most essentially. Do you 
think it makes no difference to a man what sort 
of a dinner he eats ? " 

"A great difference to some men; but does it 
make much difference in him ? " 

"Yes," said Eupert; and "Yes! " said Lawrence, 
with a unanimity which made Dolly smile. " I 
can tell you," the latter went on, "a man is one 
thing or another for the day, according to whether 
he has had a good breakfast or a bad one." 

" I understand. That's temper." 

"It is not temper at all. It is physical con- 
dition." 

" It's feeling put to 'rights, I think," said Rupert. 

" I suppose all these people are suited, in their 
several ways," said Dolly. "Will mother like
