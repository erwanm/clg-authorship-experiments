disGonsolate that his long face attracted her attention. 
Whi i's the matter, Lawry ? " she asked. 



 

" The steamer has sunk again," replied the son, 
almost choked with emotion as he uttered the words. 

" Sunk again ! " exclaimed his mother. 

" She is not to be seen, and Ben says she has gone 
down." 

" Ben says so ? " 

" Yes ; he told us of it before we came down. 
We are going to look for her now," answered Lawry, 
as he took the oars, and left the shed. 

What Lawry had said excited the suspicion of his 
mother, as she thought of the malicious words of her 
older son on the preceding evening. She was excited 
and indignant ; she feared he had executed the wicked 
purpose which she was confident he had cherished. 
She went into the house, and up stairs to the room 
where Ben still lay in bed. 

" Benjamin, what have you done ? " demanded she. 

" I haven't done anything. I'm a nobody here ! " 
replied the inebriated young man, with surly em- 
phasis. 

" What did you mean last night when you said 
that you should run that steamer, or nobody should?" 
asked Mrs. Wilford. 

 



 



" I meant just what I said. You and Lawry both 
said I shouldn't run her â€” and she has gone to the 
bottom again ; she'll stay there this time." 

" O, Benjamin ! " said his mother, bursting into 
tears. " How could you be so wicked ? " 

" Did you think I'd stay round here, and be a 
nobody?" growled the wretched young- man, whom 
the effect of the liquor, now subsiding, had ren- 
dered ugly and reckless. 

" Did you sink that steamer ? " 
' What if I did ? " 

" O, Benjamin ! " 

" You needn't cry about it. Next time, you'd 
better not try to make a nobody out of me." 

" Don't you think I've had trouble enough, with- 
out trying to make more for me ? " sobbed the 
distressed mother. 

" If you had told Lawry to give me the charge of 
the steamer, he would have done it," whined Ben. 

" I shouldn't tell him any such thing ! " replied 
Mrs. Wilford, indignantly. " A pretty captain of a 
steamboat you would make ! You are so tipsy now 
you can't hold your head up ! " 



 

" I'm as sober as you are." 

Mrs. Wilford knew that it was useless to talk to 
a person in his condition, and she left him to sleep off 
the effect of his cups if he could, after the evil deed 
he had done. Full of sympathy for Lawry, under 
his great affliction, she left the house, and hastened 
down to the landing, to learn, if possible, the condi- 
tion of the Woodville. Lawry and Ethan were in 
the wherry, returning to the shore, when she reached 
the landing. 

" Hurrah ! hurrah ! " shouted both of the boys, 
in unison, as Mrs. Wilford came in sight. 

" What now ? " asked the anxious mother, reas- 
sured by the exulting cries of the boys. 

" She's safe, mother ! She has not sunk," replied 
Lawry, as the wherry touched the shore. 

" Where is she ? I don't see her anywhere," 
added Mrs. Wilford, scanning the lake in every 
direction. 

" Over on the other side," replied Lawry, pointing 
to the locality to which the Woodville had drifted 
after Ben had cast off her cables. 

" What's the reason she didn't sink ? " continued 
his mother.
