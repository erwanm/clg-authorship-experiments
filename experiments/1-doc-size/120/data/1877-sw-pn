get there." 
"What do you know about it?" said the boy not 
very politely. " Did you ever drink it yourself? " 
" I never will again. A gentleman should be a 
free man; and wine makes men slaves. I don't 
choose to be in bondage. And if it would not en 
slave me, it does other people; and I would not 
give it the help of my example." 
Fenton dropped the subject, but renewed his proposal that they should return home. So shawls and 
worsted work were stored in the cart, and the little book in Meredith's pocket; and the line of 
march was taken up. It was indeed coming now 
to the lovely time of the day. Shadows long, lights 
glowing in warm level reflections, all objects get 
ting a sunny side and a shade side and standing 
forth in new beauty in consequence; the day gath 
ering its train, as it were, to prepare for a stately 
leave-taking by and by. Meredith and Maggie, 
loath to go, lingered the last of the party; indeed 
he had the cart to draw, which was heavy, and 
needed careful guiding in places over and between 
 
the rocks; and he could not run on with the heads 
of the party. And Maggie walked beside him, 
and put her little hand upon the handle of the cart 
which she could not help to draw. How sweet it 
was ! The light every moment growing softer, not 
cooler; the colours more contrasted, as the shadows 
lengthened; the bugle notes coming over the water 
now and then. Meredith looked, and drew deep 
breaths of the delicious air; but Maggie walked 
along pondering. 
"Ditto," she began, "do you think everybody 
ought to do mission work ? " 
" The dear Lord did not give the charge to some 
of his people, did he ? " 
"But how can they do it? Everybody cannot 
go to the heathen ? " 
" He said, ' in all the world ' so that means at 
home as well as abroad, doesn't it?" 
" Preach the Gospel in all the world ? " 
" Yes." 
" How can I, Ditto ? " 
" You and I, let us say. Well, Maggie, suppose 
we ask Mr. Murray? But one thing is certain; 
those who stay at home must furnish the money for 
those that go." 
" Does it take a great deal? " 
" Not to send a few. But how long would feio 
people be, about telling the Gospel to all the world ? 
Suppose one man had as much as the whole state 
of New York, for his parish ? " 
" He'd never get through." 
 
" Exactly. And so it is nearly nineteen hundred 
years since the Lord gave the command; and the 
heathen world is the heathen world still pretty 
much." 
" But then, Ditto to send a great many people, 
it would want a great deal of money?" 
" It does. What then ? " 
"Maybe people cannot afford it." 
" Let us ask Mr. Murray about that." 
" But Ditto, what do you think ? I know you 
think something." 
" Maggie, I think we should seek first the kingdom." 
They were turning into the shrubbery grounds 
near the house, and Maggie left the discussion. 
They were all ready for dinner, as far as appetite 
went, and in a little while the five young people 
sat down at the board. 
" This is jolly," said Fenton, who took the head 
of the table. 
" Roast-beef, to wit ? " said Meredith. 
"Roast-beef is a good thing, if you are hungry 
as I am; but I did not mean that. It is uncommonly jolly to be out of the way of the governors." 
Maggie looked up astonished. 
" ' Rulers are not a terror to good works,' " said 
Meredith. 
" They're a nuisance, though." 
" Only to one portion of society. I hope you do 
not class yourself with them." 
" Do you mean," said Maggie, making big eyes, 
 
"do you mean, Fen ton, that you are glad papa and 
mamma are in California ? " 
"No. Only one of 'em. Mamma never interferes 
with me." 
" She leaves it to papa to do," said Maggie, with 
dignity and sageness. 
"I am glad she does. Shews her wisdom. I 
can tell what is good for me, as well as anybody 
else." 
"Always do it, I suppose?" 
" That's just my affair," said Fenton. " There is 
no use in putting chains round a fellow all the 
good of it is, he must just break the chains." 
" Do you call papa's commands, chains ? " said 
Maggie. 
" Don't stare, Maggie ; nothing is so vulgar." 
" I am glad Uncle Eden is coming, to make you 
behave yourself." 
" If he tries it on, I shall bolt," said Fenton. " I 
am out for some fun ; and if I can't get it at home 
I'll get it somewhere else." 
Meredith succeeded in 'turning the conversation 
to a pleasanter subject; nevertheless Fenton's de 
liverances shocked his little sister several times in 
the course of the dinner. Among other things, 
Fenton would go down to the wine-cellar, to see 
if a bottle or two might not by chance have been 
left; and though the key was not to be had and he 
came back discomfited, Maggie could not get over 
the audacity of his proposition. She was further 
and exceedingly shocked after dinner when Fenton proposed to Meredith to have a cigar. Mere 
dith declining, Fenton went out to enjoy his cigar 
alone. 
" Fenton is grown very wild ! " said Maggie. 
"Boys can't be like girls," said Esther. 
" I don't see why they can't be as respectable as 
girls," said Maggie.
