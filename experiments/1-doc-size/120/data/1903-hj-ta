he came out with the point he had wished, after all, most 
to make. "It seems to give away, now, his game. This 
is what he has been doing — keeping me along for. He has 
been waiting for them." 
Miss Gostrey drew in her lips. " You see a good deal 
in it!" 
" I doubt if I see as much as you. Do you pretend," he 
went on, " that you don't see ? " 
" Well, what ? " — she pressed him as he paused. 
" Why, that there must be a lot between them — and 
that it has been going on from the first, even from before I 
came." 
She took a minute to answer. " Who are they then — 
if it's so grave ? " 
" It may not be grave — it may be gay. But at any rate 
  it's marked. Only I don't know," Strether had to confess, 
 " anything about them. Their name, for instance, was a 
 thing that, after little Bilham's information, I found it a 
kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up." 
" Oh," she returned, " if you think you've got off ! " 
Her laugh produced in him a momentary gloom. " I 
don't think I've got off. I only think I'm breathing for 
! about five minutes. I daresay I shall have, at the best, 
still to get on." A look, over it all, passed between them, 
 and the next minute he had come back to good-humour. 
r " I don't, meanwhile, take the smallest interest in their 
 name." 
" Nor in their nationality ? — American, French, English, 
i Polish ? " 
I " I don't care the least little ' hang,' " he smiled, " for 
their nationality. It would be nice if they're Polish ! " he 
almost immediately added. 
"Very nice indeed." The transition kept up her spirits. 
"So you see you do care." 
He did this contention a modified justice. " I think I 
should if they were Polish. Yes," he thought, " there 
I might be joy in thatr 
" Let us then hope for it." But she came, after this, 
nearer to the question. " If the girl's of the right age, of 
course the mother can't be. I mean for the virtuous 
attachment. If the girl's twenty — and she can't be less — 
the mother must be at least forty. So it puts the mother 
out. She's too old for him." 
Strether, arrested again, considered and demurred. 
"Do you think so? Do you think anyone would be too 
old for him? I'm eighty and I'm too young. But per- 
haps the girl," he continued, " isn't twenty. Perhaps she's 
only ten — but such a little dear that Chad finds himself 
counting her in as an attraction of the acquaintance. 
Perhaps she's only five. Perhaps the mother's but five- 
and-twenty — a charming young widow." 
Miss Gostrey entertained the suggestion. " She is a I 
widow then ? " 
" I haven't the least idea." They once more, in spite of  
this vagueness, exchanged a look — a look that was perhaps  
the longest yet. It seemed in fact, the next thing, to s 
require to explain itself; which it did as it could. " I only 
feel what I've told you — that he has some reason." 
Miss Gostrey's imagination had taken its own flight, 
" Perhaps she's tiot a widow." 
Strether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve. 
Still, he accepted it. " Then that's why the attachment — ' 
if it's to her — is virtuous." 
But she looked as if she scarce followed. " Why is it 
virtuous if — since she's free — there's nothing to impose on ' 
it any condition ?" 
He laughed at her question. " Oh, I perhaps don't , 
mean as virtuous as that! Your idea is that it can be I 
virtuous — in any sense worthy of the name — only if she's 
not free ? But what does it become then," he asked, " for 
her?" 
"Ah, that's another matter." He said nothing for a I 
moment, and she soon went on. " I dare say you're right, 
at any rate, about Mr. Newsome's little plan. He has been 
trying you — has been reporting on you to these friends." 
Strether, meanwhile, had had time to think more, 
" Then where's his straightness ? " ' 
" Well, as we say, it's struggling up, breaking out, 
asserting itself as it can. We can be on the side, you see, 
of his straightness. We can help him. But he has made 
out," said Miss Gostrey, "that you'll do." 
" Do for what ? " 
" Why, for them — for ccs dames. He has watched you, 
studied you, liked you — and recognised that they must. 
It's a great compliment to you, my dear man ; for I'm sure 
they're particular. You came out for a success. Well," 
she gaily declared, "you're having a success ! " 
He took it from her with momentary patience and then 
turned abruptly away. It was always convenient to him 
that there were so many fine things in her room to look at. 
But the examination of two or three of them appeared 
soon to have determined a speech that had little to do 
with them. " You don't believe in it ! " 
"In what?" 
" In the character of the attachment. In its innocence." 
But she defended herself. " I don't pretend to know 
anything about it Everything's possible. We must see." 
" See ? " he echoed with a groan. " Haven't we seen 
enough ? " 
" I haven't," she smiled. 
" But do you suppose then little Bilham has lied ? " 
"You must find out." 
It made him almost turn pale. " Find out any more?" 
He had dropped on a sofa for dismay ; but she seemed, 
as she stood over him, to have the last word. " Wasn't 
what you came out for to find out all ? " 
THE Sunday of the next week was a wonderful day, 
and Chad Nevvsome had let his friend know in 
advance that he had provided for it. There had already 
been a question of his taking him to see the great 
Gloriani, who was at home on Sunday afternoons and 
at whose house, for the most part, fewer bores were to 
be met than elsewhere ; but the project, through some 
accident, had not had instant effect. It had now, however, 
revived in happier conditions. Chad had made the point 
that the celebrated sculptor had a queer old garden, for 
which the weather — spring at last, frank and fair — was 
propitious ; and two or three of his other allusions had 
confirmed for Strether the expectation of something 
special. He had by this time, for all introductions and
