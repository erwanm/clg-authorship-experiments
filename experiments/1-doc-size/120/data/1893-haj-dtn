fear of that. Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per
month extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all. For the
present that will probably be enough."

"Oh, yes, I should think so," said Dan. "When do you want her to come to
us?"

"Now. You will take her back with you."

"To-night?" asked Dan, startled.

"Yes, to-night. I must leave New York early to-morrow. In fact, I leave
the city by an early train."

"She would have to come to our poor lodgings," said Dan, hesitatingly.

"One night there won't matter. To-morrow you can secure rooms up town."

"Yes, ma'am, I will. Our month expires to-morrow."

"Now," said the lady, rising, "since the matter is settled, come up
stairs with me, and I will show you the child."

Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a
very pleasant one.




CHAPTER XIII.

ALTHEA.


As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,
ran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand.

"I'm so glad you've got home, auntie," she said. "I got tired of being
alone."

"I staid away longer than I intended, Althea," said the lady. "I was
afraid you would feel lonely."

"I was very lonely. I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a
little girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find
me."

"I am glad you did not. I have brought you a playfellow, Althea."

This drew the little girl's attention to Dan. Unlike most girls of her
age, she was not bashful.

"What is his name?" she asked.

"Dan."

"What a funny name! Are you going to live with us, Dan?"

"You are coming to live with me," said Dan, smiling.

"Will you be my brother?"

"Yes."

"And will you play with me?"

"Sometimes."

"I think I shall like you. You are nice-looking," said Althea, in a
matter-of-fact tone.

Dan blushed. He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a
little girl.

"So are you, Althea," he said.

"I don't think I am," said Althea. "I've black hair, and my skin is
dark. You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am."

"Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.

"I don't. I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."

Dan smiled. He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not.

"You will like to live with Dan, my dear?" said her aunt, inquiringly.

"Yes, if you come, too."

"But I can't."

"Why, not, auntie?"

"I have got to go away--on business."

Althea looked disappointed.

"I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said. "Dan and I can't live
alone."

"Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."

"Will she take care of me?" asked Althea, brightening up.

"Yes, Althea."

"Is she nice?"

"Yes."

"Then she will be my mother?"

"Yes; you can call her mother."

"And you will come to see me some time, auntie?"

"Yes, my dear."
