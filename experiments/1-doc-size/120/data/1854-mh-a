fell over the rock, at the foot of the sloping lawn; carpeting the
forest with tesselated gold; and the sheen of Ida's pine-grove was as
of millions of burnished needles.

"It is brighter here!" said Ida, laying her friend's hand upon her
breast.

"You need not say so;--your smile shows it. It is like sunshine itself."

"Shall I tell her?" thought Ida. "Not yet! he will be here in a few
days--and then!"--and the heart-bound threw the blood, in a scarlet
gush to her cheeks.

Love like hers is never selfish. When they were separating to dress,
she called Laura into her room. Two dresses--a rose-coloured challe,
and a white muslin were upon the bed. "No thanks, dear!" she said, as
the delighted creature clasped her arms about her neck, in speechless
gratitude. "You, who do so much for me and mine, deserve some token of
regard. What! tears! Dry them instantly, and try your dresses. Ah!
they fit! I thought we were nearly the same size,--so had them cut by
my patterns. Emma! step in here! Are we not proud of our pupil?"

"She does not require fine robes to win praise from me," said Emma.
"How handsome and becoming! just what one might expect from the donor."

"She is the best, dearest friend I have"--began Laura, smiling through
her tears.

"Hush!" said Ida, threateningly. "Flatterers! both of you! be off and
'beautify' as Charley says. And Laura--do you hear? don't have eyes and
dress to match! a contrast is better."

The main part of Sunnybank house was capped by a sort of belvidere,
accessible by steps from the garret. Why it had been built was one
of Ida's childish studies; and the acquisition of other knowledge
was no help to the elucidation of this mystery. Emma said the
founder of the mansion had an astronomical turn, and used it as an
observatory;--Laura, that it was a belfry, from which the alarm-bell
was sounded to collect the surrounding settlers, when an incursion was
made by the savages; Ida's more matter-of-fact belief was that her
ancestor had more fondness than taste for ornamental architecture, and
so planned this tuft to the conical crown of his habitation. On the
birth-night, this was to be illuminated; the brackets were prepared,
and some of the candles in the sockets. Nearer and faster descended the
darkness. Aunt Judy fidgeted from the kitchen to the house, and from
the house to the kitchen, in mortal fear for the credit of her supper.
Miss Betsey prognosticated upsettings and wheel-breakings, and "hoped
the horses were sure-footed. That hill, the other side of Tim's Creek
was awful of a dark night."

"I say, girls!" exclaimed Ida, "we will light the belvidere! They can
see it six miles off. Anything but idle waiting!"

She was to stand in the yard, and direct the disposition of the
lights--Laura, Emma and Will, who thought no whim of his "mistis"
absurd, ascended to the roof. The breeze was at rest; and the rays shot
forth, clear and straight, down the avenue, magnifying the proportions
of the fantastic roof. The others came out to admire the effect with
her.

"Hist!" said she. "Music!"

But there was not a sound.

"I heard it--I know!" said she, positively. "Come into the porch."

Another note was repeated by the hills. "I said so! they are
coming--singing! Isn't that like Charley?" She distinguished
voices as they approached;--Carry's soft alto; Mrs. Dana's
soprano,--"Arthur--yes! that is his tenor--and Mr. Dana and Charley
have the base!"

"The tune changes!" said Emma. "Auld Lang Syne--oh! how sweet!"

Ida's eyes were streaming,--her heart aching with joy. The
carriages--two--and a buggy, drove up to the door; and with a scream
of rapture she lifted Carry to the ground,--not knowing who came
next--only that they were all there. All! no! where was Charley? She
stopped upon the steps; Elle holding to her dress; one hand in Carry's,
the other upon her guardian's arm.

"Charley! where are you?"

"Here!" with a muster-roll intonation. He raised her fingers to his
lips--an unprecedented action with him--and holding them still, looked
over his shoulder. "Here is a gentleman who is afraid you will shut
your doors upon him, for coming without a special invitation."

"Mr. Germaine!" thought Ida, fearfully;--but his was not the figure
that emerged from the shade,--nor the warm grasp, in which Charley,
with a movement full of grace and feeling, placed her hand;--nor his
the voice that said--"I do not doubt her hospitality, but my deserts."

"Do you forget your friends, that you expect a similar fate, Mr. Lacy?"
said Ida.

His actual presence was the roseleaf upon the mantling cup of bliss.
It did not overflow;--tumultuating passions were stilled into a calm,
delicious ecstacy. She was more composed than she had been at any time
since the reading of the letter,--saw everything, thought of everybody.
Carry and Emma went up-stairs arm in arm, and Ida, her baby namesake,
folded to her heart, was following Mrs. Dana, when she recollected
Laura. She was standing, alone and overlooked, in the hall.

"Here, Laura! I confide my darling to your keeping. Gently! don't wake
her. Is she not a lovely babe?"

"Beautiful!" said Laura, in proud gratification.

The sleepy children's suppers were brought up, and they were snug in
bed before their elders were prepared for their meal. The gentlemen
were in the yard, looking at the belvidere.

"Your beacon puzzled us considerably," said Charley to Ida. "It
appeared to be upon the summit of a huge, shapeless height. We thought
we had lost our road and wandered off to the Enchanted Mountains."

"Or that a remnant of Ghebers had an asylum among these hills," said
Mr. Lacy. "You should have heard Charley's
