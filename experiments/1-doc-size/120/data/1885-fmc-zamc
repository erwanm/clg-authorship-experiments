misty hills to eastward, and there were lights beneath 
the columned portico. She paused and looked back 
across the peaceful valley, and far down below, a 
solitary nightingale called out a few melancholy notes, 
and then burst forth into glorious song. 

Nehushta turned again to go in, and there were 
tears in her dark eyes, that had not stood there for 
many a long day. But she clasped her hands to- 
gether, and went forward between the crouching 




slaves, straight to Atossa's apartment. It was not 
usual for any one to gain access to the elder queen's 
inner chambers without first obtaining permission 
from Atossa herself, and Nehushta had never been 
there. They met rarely in public, and spoke little, 
though each maintained the appearances of courtesy ; 
but Atossa's smile was the sweeter of the two. In 
private they never saw each other ; and the queen's 
slaves would perhaps have tried to prevent Nehushta 
from entering, but her black eyes flashed upon them 
in such dire wrath as she saw them before her, that 
they crouched away and let her pass on unmolested. 

Atossa sat, as ever at that hour, in her toilet- 
chamber, surrounded by her tirewomen. The room 
was larger than the one at Shushan, for she had 
caused it to be built after her own plans ; but her 
table was the same as ever, and upon it stood the 
broad silver mirror, which she never allowed to be 
left behind when she travelled. 

Her magnificent beauty had neither changed nor 
faded in three years. Such strength as hers was not 
to be broken, nor worn out, by the mere petty annoy- 
ances of palace life. She could sustain the constant 
little warfare she waged against the king, without 
even so much as looking careworn and pale for a 
moment, though the king himself often looked dark 
and weary, and his eyes were heavy with sleepless- 
ness for the trouble she gave him. Yet he could 
never determine to rid himself of her, even when he 
began to understand the profound badness of her 
character. She exercised a certain fascination over 
him, as a man grows fond of some beautiful, wicked 



 

beast he has half-tamed, though it turn and show its 
teeth at him sometimes, and be altogether more of a 
care than a pastime. She was so fair and evil that 
he could not hurt her ; it would have seemed a crime 
to destroy anything so wondrously made. Moreover, 
she could amuse him and make many an hour pass 
pleasantly when she was so disposed. 

She was fully attired for the banquet that was to 
take place late in the evening, but her women were 
still about her, and she looked at herself critically in 
the mirror, and would have changed the pinning of 
her tiara, so that her fair hair should fall forward upon 
one side, instead of backwards over her shoulder. 
She tried the effect of the change upon her face, and 
peered into the mirror beneath the bright light of the 
tall lamps; when, on a sudden, as she looked, she 
met the reflection of two angry dark eyes, and she 
knew that Nehushta was behind her. 

She rose to her feet, turning quickly, and the sweep 
of her long robe overthrew the light carved chair upon 
the marble floor. She faced Nehushta with a cold 
smile that betrayed surprise at being thus interrupted 
in her toilet rather than any dread of the interview. 
Her delicate eyebrows arched themselves in some- 
thing of scorn, but her voice came low and sweet as 
ever. 

" It is rarely indeed that the queen Nehushta deigns 
to visit her servant," she said. " Had she sent warn- 
ing of her coming, she would have been more fittingly 
received." 

Nehushta stood still before her. She hated that 
cool, still voice that choked her like a tightening bow- 
string about her neck. 



 

" We have small need of court formalities," answered 
the Hebrew woman, shortly. " 1 desire to speak with 
yon alone upon a matter of importance." 

"I am alone," returned Atossa, seating herself upon 
the carved chair, which one of the slaves had instantly 
set up again, and motioning to Nehushta to be seated. 
But Nehushta glanced at the serving-women and 
remained standing. 

" You are not alone," she said briefly. 

" They are not women — they are slaves," answered 
Atossa, with a smile. 

"Will you not send them away?" 

"Why should I?" 

" You need not — I will," returned Nehushta. 
" Begone, and quickly ! " she added, turning to the 
little group of women and slave-girls who stood to- 
gether, looking on in wonder. At Nehushta's imperious command, they hurried through the door, and 
the curtains fell behind them. They knew Nehushta's 
power in the palace too well to hesitate to obey her,
