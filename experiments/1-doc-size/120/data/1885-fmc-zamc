one bearing a fan and the other a small carpet and a 
cushion — black women from the southern parts of 
Syria, towards Egypt, who would not understand the 
high Persian she would be likely to speak with 
Zoroaster, though her own Hebrew tongue was intelligible to them. When she reached a quiet spot, 
where one of the walks ended suddenly in a little 
circle among the rose-trees, far down from the palace, 
she had her carpet spread, and her cushion was placed 
upon it, and she wearily sat down. The fan-girl 
began to ply her palm-leaf, as much to cool the heated 
summer air as to drive away the swarms of tiny gnats 
which abounded in the garden. Nehushta rested upon 
one elbow, her feet drawn together upon the carpet 
of dark soft colours and waited a few minutes as 
though in thought. At last she seemed to have 
decided, and turned to the slave who had brought her 



 

cushion, as she stood at a little distance, motionless, 
her hands folded and hidden under the thickness of 
the broad sash that girded her tunic at the waist. 

" Go thou," said the queen, " and seek out the high 
priest Zoroaster, and bring him hither quickly." 

The black woman turned and ran like a deer down 
the narrow path, disappearing in a moment amongst 
the shrubbery. 

The breeze of the swinging fan blew softly on 
Nehushta's pale face and stirred the locks of heavy 
hair that fell from her tiara about her shoulders. 
Her eyes were half closed as she leaned back, and 
her lips were parted in a weary look of weakness that 
was new to her. Nearly an hour passed and the sun 
sank low, but Nehushta hardly stirred from her 
position. 

It seemed very long before she heard steps upon 
the walk — the quick soft step of the slave-woman 
running before, barefooted and fleet, and presently 
the heavier tread of a man's leather shoe. The slave 
stopped at the entrance to the little circle of rose- 
trees, and a moment later, Zoroaster strode forward, 
and stood still and made a deep obeisance, a few 
steps from Nehushta. 

" Forgive me that I sent for thee, Zoroaster," said 
the queen in quiet tones. But, as she spoke, a slight 
blush overspread her face, and relieved her deadly 
pallor. " Forgive me — I have somewhat to say 
which thou must hear." 

Zoroaster remained standing before her as she 
spoke, and his luminous eyes rested upon her quietly. 

" I wronged thee three years ago, Zoroaster," said 



 

the queen in a low voice, but looking up at him. "1 
pray thee, forgive me — I knew not what I did." 

"I forgave thee long ago," answered the high 
priest. 

" I did thee a bitter wrong — but the wrong I did 
myself was even greater. I never knew till I went 
and asked — her ! " At the thought of Atossa, the 
Hebrew woman's eyes flashed fire, and her small 
fingers clenched upon her palm. But, in an instant, 
her sad, weary look returned. 

" That is all — if you forgive me," she said, and 
turned her head away. It seemed to her that there 
was nothing more to be said. He did not love her 
— he was far beyond love. 

" Now, by Ahura Mazda, I have indeed forgiven 
thee. The blessing of the All-Wise be upon thee ! " 
Zoroaster bent again, as though to take his leave, and 
he would have gone from her. 

But when she heard his first footsteps, Nehushta 
raised herself a little and turned quickly towards 
him. It seemed as though the only light she knew 
were departing from her day. 

" You loved me once," she said, and stopped, with 
an appealing look on her pale face. It was very weak 
of her ; but oh ! she was far spent with sorrow and 
grief. Zoroaster paused, and looked back upon her, 
very calmly, very gently. 

" Ay — I loved you once — but not now. There 
is no more love in the earth for me. But I bless you 
for the love you gave me." 

"I loved you so well," said Nehushta. "I love 
you still," she added, suddenly raising herself and 



 

gazing on him with a Avild look in her eyes. " Oh, 
I love you still ! " she cried passionately. "I thought 
I had put you away — forgotten you — trodden out 
your memory that I so hated I could not bear to hear 
your name ! Ah ! why did I do it, miserable woman 
that I am ! I love you now — T love you — I love 
you with my whole heart — and it is too late ! " She 
fell back upon her cushion, and covered her face with 
her hands, and her breast heaved with passionate, 
tearless sobbing.
