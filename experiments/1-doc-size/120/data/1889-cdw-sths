of the city, then makes a bold push for the north in order to avoid
Algiers and reach the foot of Canal Street, and encountering there the
heart of the town, it sheers off again along the old French quarter and
Jackson Square due east, and goes no one knows where, except perhaps Mr.
Eads.

The city is supposed to lie in this bend of the river, but it in fact
extends eastward along the bank down to the Barracks, and spreads
backward towards Lake Pontchartrain over a vast area, and includes some
very good snipe-shooting.

Although New Orleans has only about a quarter of a million of
inhabitants, and so many only in the winter, it is larger than Pekin,
and I believe than Philadelphia, having an area of about one hundred and
five square miles. From Carrollton to the Barracks, which are not far
from the Battle-field, the distance by the river is some thirteen miles.
From the river to the lake the least distance is four miles. This vast
territory is traversed by lines of horse-cars which all meet in Canal
Street, the most important business thoroughfare of the city, which
runs north-east from the river, and divides the French from the American
quarter. One taking a horse-car in any part of the city will ultimately
land, having boxed the compass, in Canal Street. But it needs a person
of vast local erudition to tell in what part of the city, or in what
section of the home of the frog and crawfish, he will land if he takes
a horse-ear in Canal Street. The river being higher than the city, there
is of course no drainage into it; but there is a theory that the water
in the open gutters does move, and that it moves in the direction of
the Bayou St. John, and of the cypress swamps that drain into Lake
Pontchartrain. The stranger who is accustomed to closed sewers, and to
get his malaria and typhoid through pipes conducted into his house by
the most approved methods of plumbing, is aghast at this spectacle
of slime and filth in the streets, and wonders why the city is not in
perennial epidemic; but the sun and the wind are great scavengers, and
the city is not nearly so unhealthy as it ought to be with such a city
government as they say it endures.

It is not necessary to dwell much upon the external features of New
Orleans, for innumerable descriptions and pictures have familiarized
the public with them. Besides, descriptions can give the stranger little
idea of the peculiar city. Although all on one level, it is a town of
contrasts. In no other city of the United States or of Mexico is the
old and romantic preserved in such integrity and brought into such
sharp contrast to the modern. There are many handsome public buildings,
churches, club-houses, elegant shops, and on the American side a great
area of well-paved streets solidly built up in business blocks. The
Square of the original city, included between the river and canal,
Rampart and Esplanade streets, which was once surrounded by a wall, is
as closely built, but the streets are narrow, the houses generally are
smaller, and although it swarms with people, and contains the cathedral,
the old Spanish buildings, Jackson Square, the French Market, the French
Opera-house, and other theatres, the Mint, the Custom-house, the old
Ursuline convent (now the residence of the archbishop), old banks, and
scores of houses of historic celebrity, it is a city of the past, and
specially interesting in its picturesque decay. Beyond this, eastward
and northward extend interminable streets of small houses, with now and
then a flowery court or a pretty rose garden, occupied mainly by people
of French and Spanish descent. The African pervades all parts of the
town, except the new residence portion of the American quarter. This,
which occupies the vast area in the bend of the river west of the
business blocks as far as Carrollton, is in character a great village
rather than a city. Not all its broad avenues and handsome streets
are paved (and those that are not are in some seasons impassable), its
houses are nearly all of wood, most of them detached, with plots of
ground and gardens, and as the quarter is very well shaded, the effect
is bright and agreeable. In it are many stately residences, occupying a
square or half a square, and embowered in foliage and flowers. Care
has been given lately to turf-culture, and one sees here thick-set
and handsome lawns. The broad Esplanade Street, with its elegant
old-fashioned houses, and double rows of shade trees, which has
long been the rural pride of the French quarter, has now rivals in
respectability and style on the American side.

New Orleans is said to be delightful in the late fall months, before the
winter rains set in, but I believe it looks its best in March and April.
This is owing to the roses. If the town was not attached to the name
of the Crescent City, it might very well adopt the title of the City of
Roses. So kind are climate and soil that the magnificent varieties of
this queen of flowers, which at the North bloom only in hot-houses, or
with great care are planted out-doors in the heat of our summer, thrive
here in the open air in prodigal abundance and beauty. In April the town
is literally embowered in them; they fill door-yards and gardens, they
overrun the porches, they climb the sides of the houses, they spread
over the trees, they take possession of trellises and fences and walls,
perfuming the air and entrancing the heart with color. In the outlying
parks, like that of the Jockey Club, and the florists’ gardens at
Carrollton, there are fields of them, acres of the finest sorts waving
in the spring wind. Alas! can beauty ever satisfy? This wonderful
spectacle fills one with I know not what exquisite longing. These
flowers pervade the town, old women on the street corners sit behind
banks of them, the florists’ windows blush with them, friends despatch
to each other great baskets of them, the favorites at the theatre and
the amateur performers stand behind high barricades of roses which the
good-humored audience piles upon the stage, everybody carries roses
and wears roses, and the houses overflow with them. In this passion for
flowers you may read a prominent trait of the people. For myself I like
to see a spot on this earth where beauty is enjoyed for itself and
let to run to waste, but if ever the industrial spirit of the
French-Italians should prevail along the littoral of Louisiana and
Mississippi, the raising of flowers for the manufacture of perfumes
would become a most profitable industry.

New Orleans is the most cosmopolitan of provincial cities. Its
comparative isolation has secured the development of provincial traits
and manners, has preserved the individuality of the many races that
give it color, morals, and character, while its close relations with
France—an affiliation and sympathy which the late war has not altogether
broken—and the constant influx of Northern men of business and affairs
have given it the air of a metropolis. To the Northern stranger the
aspect and the manners of the city are foreign, but if he remains long
enough he is sure to yield to its fascinations, and become a partisan
of it. It is not altogether the soft and somewhat enervating and
occasionally treacherous climate that beguiles him, but quite as much
the easy terms on which life can be lived. There is a human as well as a
climatic amiability that wins him. No doubt it is better for a man to
be always braced up, but no doubt also there is an attraction in a
complaisance that indulges his inclinations.

Socially as well as commercially New Orleans is in a transitive state.
The change from river to railway transportation has made her levees
vacant; the shipment of cotton by rail and its direct transfer to ocean
