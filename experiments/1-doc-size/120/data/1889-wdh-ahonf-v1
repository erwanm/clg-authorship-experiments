 

about, Alma Leighton. If you don't like Mr. 
Beaton " 

" I don't." 

" You don't ? You know better than that. You 
know that you did care for him." 

" Oh ! that 's a very different thing. That 's a 
thing that can be got over." 

" Got over ! " repeated Mrs. Leighton, aghast. 

" Of course, it can ! Don't be romantic, mamma. 
Peoj)le get over dozens of such fancies. They even 
marry for love two or three times." 

" Never ! " cried her mother, doing her best to 
feel shocked, and at last looking it. 

Her looking it had no effect upon Alma. "You 
can easily get over caring for people ; but you can't 
get over liking them— if you like them because they 
are sweet and good. That's what lasts. I was a 
simple goose, and he imposed upon me because he 
was a sophisticated goose. Now the case is reversed." 

" He does care for you, now. You can see it. 
Why do you encourage him to come here ? " 

"I don't," said Alma. "I will tell him to keep 
away if you like. But whether he comes or goes, it 
will be the same." 

" Not to him, Alma ! He is in love with you ! " 

" He has never said so." 

"And you would really let him say so, when you 
intend to refuse him ? " 

"I can't very well refuse him till he does say so." 

This was undeniable. Mrs. Leighton could only 
demand in an awful tone, " May I ask ivhy—ii you 



 

cared for him ; and I know you care for him still — 
you will refuse him ? " 

Alma laughed. "Because — because I'm wedded 
to my Art, and I 'm not going to commit bigamy, 
whatever I do." 

"Alma!" 

" Well, then, because I don't lihc him — that is, I 
don't believe in him, and don't trust him. He 's 
fascinating, but he 's false and he 's fickle. He can't 
help it, I dare say." 

" And you are perfectly hard. Is it possible that 
you were actually pleased to have Mr. Fulkerson 
tease you about Mr. Dryfoos ? " 

" Oh, good night, now, mamma ! This is becom- 
ing personal." 



PART THIRD. 
I. 

The scheme of a banquet to celebrate the initial 
success of Every Other JFeek expanded in Fulkerson's 
fancy into a series. Instead of the pubhshing and 
editorial force, with certain of the more representa- 
tive artists and authors sitting down to a modest 
supper in Mrs. Leighton's parlours, he conceived of 
a dinner at Delmonico's, with the principal literary 
and artistic people throughout the country as guests, 
and an inexhaustible hospitality to reporters and 
correspondents, from whom paragraphs, prophetic 
and historic, would flow weeks before and after the 
first of the series. He said the thing was a new de- 
parture in magazines ; it amounted to something in 
literature as radical as the American Revolution in 
politics : it was the idea of self-government in the 
arts ; and it was this idea that had never yet been 
fully developed in regard to it. That was what 
must be done in the speeches at the dinner, and the 
speeches must be reported. Then it would go like 
wildfire. He asked March whether he thought Mr. 
Depew could be got to come ; Mark Twain, he was 




sure would come ; he was a literary man. They 
ought to invite Mr. Evarts, and the Cardinal and 
the leading- Protestant divines. His ambition 
stopped at nothing, nothing hut the question of 
expense ; there he had to wait the return of the 
cider Dryfoos from the West, and Dryfoos was still 
delayed at Moffitt, and Fulkerson openly confessed 
that he was afraid he would stay there till his own 
enthusiasm escaped in other activities, other plans. 

Fulkerson was as little likely as possible to fall 
under a superstitious subjection to another man ; but 
March could not help seeing that in this possible 
measure Dryfoos was Fulkerson's fetish. He did not 
revere him, March decided, because it was not in
