It was very well, Marilla thought, that Jack 
had a companion who was not fond of "kids." 
Stevie lived quite a distance below and had 
brought no end of playthings, had an auto 
wagon that two could sit in, though only 
one could be chauffeur. So Marilla had the 
babies out on the side lawn all the morning 
in the shade, and after their nap took them 
out in the carriage. They were quite fond 
of walking, too. They really were rather 
amiable again. 

"Miss Florence, could I have some paper 
and a pencil?’’ she asked during their noon- 
tide nap. promised to write to Dr. Richards 
and tell him if I kept well.” 

"Why not to Miss Armitage?” was the 
inquiry. 

"She w’as going to Canada, and — I’m quite 
well again, and the babies are so much better. 
He will be glad to hear, for he felt very sorry 
about them, and he said I must write.” 



suppose Miss Armitage’s house is very 
grand, much finer than ours?’’ 

"It’s beautiful and she has such a lovely 
organ. Well, it’s different and there are two 
big parlors and some curious things that I 
never saw before and chairs in beautiful 
light blue, all flowered, and some tall vases 
and marble statues. And there’s Jane and 
Norah — and the wash goes out. Yes, I sup- 
pose she’s rich.” 

"And you’d like to live there?” 

'Perhaps she wouldn’t want me,” the child 
said simply. 

Evidently there had been no talk about it. 

Miss Borden gave her pencil and paper. 

Marilla went to the kitchen nursery, sat 
down on a stool and put her paper on the 
bottom of the wooden chair. She began — 
'Dear Dr. Richards.” Oh, there was so much 
to say! She was well and the babies were 
improved and could talk a good deal and looked 
better for not being so fat. She really liked 
home better and Bridget’s kitchen was so 
clean, and there was always a nice white 
cloth on the table. It seemed a funny way 
to live but many of the people did not have 





meals in their own houses, but went over to 
the eating place. can’t spell the other 
word,” she admitted naively. There were so 
many pretty girls in lovely frocks who walked 
up and down and didn’t have to take care 
of babies. don’t believe I am as fond of 
babies as I used to be. I get tired of having 
them every day,” she explained frankly. ' 'And 
soon I shall begin to count on the five years.” 

She filled up the whole sheet, folded, 
slipped it in the envelope and fastened it. 
Oh, she must ask for a stamp. She could run 
down to the postoffice. 

Miss Borden was curious to know what 
was in the letter, whether Marilla had found 
any fault with her surroundings, but the eager, 
honest face disarmed curiosity that could 
not be easily gratified. So the letter went its 
way. 

There were many things to entertain a 
child whose former life had been narrow. Some 
of the girls spoke to her. "Were the babies 
her sisters?” 

"Oh, no. She was — well their nurse.” 

"How odd they looked! Is that little Jack 
their brother?” 



Oh how ardently she wished they 
were, pretty. 

''He looks more like you than like them. 
You've both got such pretty curly hair, 
though his is darker. I think curly hair's 
just lovely. I wish mine curled, and you've 
such a pretty dimple in your chin." 

Marilla blushed at the praise. 

"What are the babies called?" 

Marilla repeated their names. 

"That's funny — they're so much alike." 

"Well — they're twins," said another. 

Then the babies thought it was time they 
joined in the conversation, and a funny mess 
they made of it. Pansy said —
