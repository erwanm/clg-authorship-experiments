into the less ominous Headingley Cause- 
way. 
At the other end of the town, not far 
 

from the gates of Tatton Park, still 
sleeps the old vicarage, a modest dwell- 
ing in a circling yard, — that yard where 
poor Peter played his little comedy des- 
tined to end in grief. Who does not 
remember it, — how Peter dressed him- 
self in Deborah's gown and bonnet, and 
juggled a pillow into the semblance of 
a baby in long clothes, and how the rec- 
tor came upon him as he paraded him- 
self and his charge before the gaping 
townsfolk ? The rest of the story is too 
sad for any but sunny days; for Peter 
was flogged and ran away to sea, as 
every one knows, while the rector re- 
pented his angry vengeance in the ashes 
of old age, and the gentle house-mother 
died awaiting her boy's return. 

The actual spots connected with Mrs. 
Gaskell's life in Cranford need no broid- 
ery of fancy. Looking over the Heath 
stands the comfortable, dignified house 
where she lived with Mrs. Lumb. Hers 
was not an altogether untroubled child- 
hood, suggests Mrs. Ritchie, and she 
pictures the little girl running "away 
from her aunt's house across the 
Heath," hiding "herself in one of its 
many green hollows, finding comfort in 
 

the silence, and in the company of birds 
and insects and natural things." At 
that time, the Heath was less of a 
trodden village common than to-day, 
more populous with birds, richer in furze 
and leaf. But though the identical 
house has been enlarged and repaired, 
its character of homelike comfort is un- 
changed. There are happy windows, 
with great window -seats, looking out 
over the Heath and into the garden at 
the back. Sun and light are every- 
where, and in the garden beds lie the 
richness and beauty of old-fashioned 
flowers. 

But of all spots made to please the 
memory and stir it with suggestions not 
to be denied is Sandlebridge Farm, 
where lived the Hollands who were 
Mrs. Gaskell's maternal ancestors. An 
agreeable though unexciting walk leads 
to it, between fields green with the won- 
derful grass that goes to the making of 
Cheshire cheese, and golden with but- 
tercups. Such far reaches of field and 
valley are here as to make a not unpleas- 
ing loneliness in the land, even under 
full sunlight; and when, approaching 
the farm, you come to a smithy and 
 

mill dedicated to the uses of life, still 
the illusion is not dispelled. For in the 
smithy two or three leisurely men lean 
and look in the intervals of smiling talk, 
and the mill, sweet and dusty from the 
breath of grain, goes on working quite 
by itself. Great wooden beams, heavy 
wheels, and dusty hoppers seemed, that 
day, to be living a life of uncompanioned 
yet happy activity, and from without 
came the plashy plash of willing water 
and the trickle of the feeding stream. 
In the hazy distance loomed Alderley 
Edge, a mammoth ridge rising above 
the hidden caverns where nine hundred 
and ninety -nine horses stand "ever 
caparisoned and ready for war." 

Mrs. Gaskell, when a little girl, must 
often have visited the farm to play with 
the Holland children ; but the spot has 
another distinction, more potent still; 
for Sandlebridge is Cranford's Woodley, 
where Mr. Thomas Holbrook lived, and 
read "my Lord Byrron," and ate his 
peas happily without the aid of a fork, 
and where Miss Matty came to him too 
late. The great stone balls are gone 
from the pillars beside the gate (the 
great Lord Clive used to jump from one 
 

to the Other, when he was a schoolboy 
at Knutsford), and the ancient deco- 
rum of the manor has subsided into the 
well-being of a prosperous farm ; but the 
spot is full of a slumberous peace. We 
were entertained in the stone - flagged 
kitchen, with its dresser of blue dishes 
on the wall and its flitches of bacon 
hanging from the hooks above, and we 
drank our milk and ate the sweet farm 
bread with a drowsy sense that some- 
how dear Miss Matty was with us, and 
perhaps the sonsy Mary who tells the 
tale. Do you remember how Mary 
walked about the garden with that an- 
tique lover who loved no more, listen- 
ing to his comments on flower and leaf ; 
and how she afterwards went with him 
to the fields, where he forgot her and
