with the little girl.

"It's been just splendid! Mrs. Stevens is--well, she is grand, and, oh,
you ought to see the beautiful gowns she wears; but she doesn't hold you
way off. You can come up close and lean on her shoulder or her lap. They
were both so good. And, look! Cousin Giles would buy me these two
rings;" and she held up her hand laughingly. "And an elegant necklace. I
told him there were so many things here that were my mother's, but he
wouldn't mind. And slippers! There's white, and a kind of gray, and a
bronze, and a red pair. The little girls wear them when they come from
school and go out to companies. Oh, Cousin Chilian, doesn't any one play
on the spinet? I'd like to learn."

"It's very old. It was mother's. I think we must have a new one. And you
can learn."

"Oh, I shall be so glad."

Mrs. Taft was out in the kitchen. "Now you all go your ways," she began.
"'Taint nothing to clear off the supper table."

They sat out on the front porch. But through the talk Cynthia kept
thinking of poor Cousin Elizabeth and feeling sorry she had not enjoyed
more of the pleasures of life. Was there so much real virtue in making
life hard and cold? But there were some girls in school who were very
much afraid of dancing and reading story-books.

Truth to tell, as Chilian listened, he came to experience a queer
feeling--he would have scouted the idea of jealousy about Cousin Giles,
but that he should have devoted himself so much to her and taken her
about, wanted to buy trinkets for her and all that! There was still a
week of vacation left. They would go somewhere to-morrow.

He had asked Mrs. Taft to stay with them.

"Well, I can't exactly promise. You see, I like to 'wrastle' with things
and fight off the worst. Though I hadn't much hope of 'Lisbeth when the
doctor said her spine was hurt. That's a kind of queer hidden thing that
even doctors can't see into. And the poor creature suffered a good deal.
My, but she was spunky and was bound not to die, and I fought for her
all I could. But the last few weeks there was a change. She liked Cynthy
to come in with the posies and say something bright. And now it's all
done and over, and she was a good upright woman in the old-fashioned
way. So I'll stay a spell till Miss Eunice gets used to the change, and
when I see another good fight somewhere, you mustn't have hard feelings
if I go."

They went out the next morning and found a boat going up to Plum Island.
It was like going to sea to go around Rockport Point. Captain Green
declared "he wan't much on passengers, but he had a nice cabin and an
awning on the for'ard deck, and there was a woman and some children
whose husband living up there had bespoke passage."

It was a fine day with the right sort of wind. Oh, how splendid it was
as they went out oceanward. She had been on the water such a very little
since her long voyage.

Mrs. Halcom had three children and a baby. She was a plain, commonplace
body, who had been living up to North Salem, but her folks were
Newburyport people and she should be glad to get in sight and sound of
them once again. Chilian had brought a book along, Ben Johnson's Plays,
and now and then he met with such a charming line or two he must read it
to her. There were some new poets coming to the fore as well, but he
knew most of the older ones. Oh, he must get back his youth for her
sake. Cousin Giles was ever so much older.

She was interested in the ship as well and talked to Captain Green. He
had so many funny nautical terms, provincialisms, that she had to
inquire what some of the words meant. For most of the early people of
New England had not dropped into the careless modes of speech that were
to come later on and be adopted as a sort of patois. They read their
Bibles a good deal and the older divines, and if their speech was a
little stilted it had a certain correctness. Then Chilian Leverett was
rather fastidious in this respect.

The wind filled the sails and they skimmed along merrily. Now the sea
was green and so clear you could see the fish disporting themselves.
Then the sun tinted it with gold and threw up diamond, amethyst, and
emeralds, taunting one with treasures.

There are new names along the coast, though a few of the old ones
remain. They passed Gloucester, Thatcher's Island, rounded Rockport,
where in the inside harbor they had to unload part of their cargo. Then
on to Plum Island, where the rest were set ashore and the woman and her
children. Some few things were taken on board, but they were to stop at
Gloucester, going down for the return cargo.

They walked about a little and bought some ripe, luscious dewberries and
fruit.

"How queer it would be to live on an island and have to take your boat
when you went anywhere," and Cynthia laughed gayly.

"People do, farther up. There are a great many islands on the coast of
Maine, and fishermen are living on them."

"And in Boston Harbor Cousin Giles took us out. It's funny that they
don't float off. Do they go 'way down to the bottom of the sea?"

"I think they must. Sometimes one does disappear."

"Suppose you were living on it. And you saw the water coming up all
around you and you couldn't get away----"

Her eyes filled with a kind of terror.

"Oh, you would have some boats."

"But if it happened in the night?"

"We won't go and live on an island," he said with a smile.

It was rougher going back, but not bad enough to cause any alarm. The
wind had died down, but the swells were coming in. They stopped at
Gloucester and took on some boxes and great planks, and several pieces
of furniture.

"There's enough old truck in Salem now," declared Captain Green
ungraciously. "'F I had my way I'd turn it out on the Common and put a
match to it. Now there's the Hibbins--came over in 1680 and brought
