mented by the remnant of property that had come to her 
from her mother. That she was capable of returning to 
the Prince some day, through not daring to face the loss 
of luxury, was an idea that could not occur to Hyacinth, 
in the midst of her assurances, uttered at various times, 
that she positively yearned for a sacrifice ; and such an 
apprehension was less present to him than ever as he 
listened to Madame Grandoni's account of the manner in 
which her rupture with the fashionable world had been 
effected. It must be added that the old lady remarked, 



io   xxxm 

with a sigh, that she didn't know how it would .all end, as 
some of Christina's economies were very costly ; and when 
Hyacinth pressed her a little she went on to say that it was 
not at present the question of complications arising from the 
Prince that troubled her most, but the fear that Christina 
was seriously compromised by her reckless, senseless cor- 
respondences letters arriving from foreign countries, from 
God knew whom (Christina never told her, nor did she 
desire it), all about uprisings and liberations (of so much 
one could be sure), and other matters that were no concern 
of honest folk. Hyacinth scarcely knew what Madame 
Grandoni meant by this allusion, which seemed to show 
that, during the last few months, the Princess had con- 
siderably extended her revolutionary connection : he only 
thought of Hoffendahl, whose name, however, he was 
careful not to pronounce, and wondered whether his 
hostess had been writing to the Master to intercede for 
htm, to beg that he might be let off. His cheeks burned 
at the thought, but he contented himself with remarking 
to Madame Grandoni that their extraordinary friend enjoyed 
the sense of danger. The old lady wished to know how 
she would enjoy the hangman's rope (with which, du train 
dont elk allait, she might easily make acquaintance) ; and 
when he expressed the hope that she didn't regard him as 
a counsellor of imprudence, replied, ' You, my poor child ? 
Oh, I saw into you at Medley. You are a simple codino ! ' 
The Princess came in to tea in a very dull gown, with 
a bunch of keys at her girdle; and nothing could have 
suggested the thrifty housewife better than the manner in 
which she superintended the laying of the cloth and the 
placing on it of a little austere refreshment a pile of bread 



 

and butter,, flanked by a pot of marmalade and a morsel of 
bacon. She filled the teapot out of a little tin canister 
locked up in a cupboard, of which the key worked with 
difficulty, and made the tea with her own superb hands ; 
taking pains, however, to explain to Hyacinth that she was 
far from imposing that regime on Madame Grandoni, who 
understood that the grocer had a standing order to supply 
her, for her private consumption, with any delicacy she 
might desire. For herself, she had never been so well as 
since she followed a homely diet. On Sundays they had 
muffins, and sometimes, for a change, a smoked haddock, 
or even a fried sole. Hyacinth was lost in adoration of 
the Princess's housewifely ways and of the exquisite figure 
that she made as a little bourgeoise; judging that if her 
attempt to combine plain living with high thinking were all 
a comedy, at least it was the most finished entertainment 
she had yet offered him. She talked to Madame Grandoni 
about Lady Aurora; described her with much drollery, 
even to the details of her dress; declared that she was a 
delightful creature and one of the most interesting persons 
she had seen for an age ; expressed to Hyacinth the con- 
viction that she should like her exceedingly, if Lady Aurora 
would only believe a little in her. ' But I shall like her, 
whether she does or not,' said the Princess. ' I always 
know when that's going to happen; it isn't so common. 
She will begin very well with me, and be " fascinated " 
isn't that the way people begin with me ? but she won't 
understand me at all, or make out in the least what kind of 
a queer fish I am, though I shall try to show her. When 
she thinks she does, at last, she will give me up in disgust, 

and will never know that she has understood me quite 






wrong. That has been the way with most of the people I 
have liked; they have run away from me a toutes jambes. 
Oh, I have inspired aversions ! ' laughed the Princess, hand- 
ing Hyacinth his cup of tea. He recognised it by the 
aroma as a mixture not inferior to that of which he had 
partaken at Medley. ' I have never succeeded in knowing 
any one who would do me good ; for by the time I began 
to improve, under their influence, they could put up with 
me no longer.' 

' You told me you were going to visit the poor. I don't 
understand what your Grafin was doing there,' said Madame 
Grandoni. 

' She had come out of charity in the same way as I. 
She evidently goes about immensely over there ; I shall 
entreat her to take me with her.' 

' I thought you had promised to let me be your guide, 
in those explorations,' Hyacinth remarked. 

The Princess looked at him a moment. ' Dear Mr. 
Robinson, Lady Aurora knows more than you.' 

'There have been times, surely, when you have com- 
plimented me on my knowledge.' 

' k Oh, I mean more about the lower classes ! ' the Princess 
exclaimed ; and, oddly enough, there was a sense in which 
Hyacinth was unable to deny the allegation. He presently 
returned to something she had said a moment before,
