revolving round a question which had come up immensely 
during the last few hours. The Princess was a capricciosa 
that, at least, was Madame Grandoni's account of her ; 
and was that blank, expressionless house in South Street 
a sign that an end had come to the particular caprice in 
which he had happened to be involved ? He had returned 
to London with an ache of eagerness to be with her again 
on the same terms as at Medley, a throbbing sense that 



 

unless she had been abominably dishonest he might count 
upon her. This state of mind was by no means complete 
security, but it was so sweet that it mattered little whether 
it were sound. Circumstances had favoured in an extra- 
ordinary degree his visit to her, and it was by no means 
clear that they would again be so accommodating or that 
what had been possible for a few days should be possible 
with continuity, in the midst of the ceremonies and com- 
plications of London. Hyacinth felt poorer than he had 
ever felt before, inasmuch as he had had money and spent 
it, whereas in previous times he had never had it to spend. 
He never for an instant regretted his squandered fortune, 
for he said to himself that he had made a good bargain 
and become master of a precious equivalent. The equiva- 
lent was a rich experience an experience which would 
become richer still as he should talk it over, in a low chair, 
close to hers, with the all-comprehending, all-suggesting lady 
of his life. His poverty would be no obstacle to their 
intercourse so long as he should have a pair of legs to 
carry him to her door; for she liked him better shabby 
than when he was furbished up, and she had given him too 
many pledges, they had taken together too many appoint- 
ments, worked out too many programmes, to be disconcerted 
(on either side) by obstacles that were merely a part of the 
general conventionality. He was to go with her into the 
slums, to introduce her to the worst that London contained 
(he should have, precisely, to make acquaintance with it 
first), to show her the reality of the horrors of which she 
dreamed that the world might be purged. He had ceased, 
himself, to care for the slums, and had reasons for not 
wishing to spend his remnant in the contemplation of foul 





things j but he would go through with his part of the 
engagement. He might be perfunctory, but any dreariness 
would have a gilding that should involve an association 
with her. What if she should have changed, have ceased 
to care ? What if, from a kind of royal insolence which 
he suspected to lurk somewhere in the side-scenes of her 
nature, though he had really not once seen it peep out, she 
should toss back her perfect head with a movement signi- 
fying that he was too basely literal and that she knew him 
no more? Hyacinth's imagination represented her this 
evening in places where a barrier of dazzling light shut her 
out from access, or even from any appeal. He saw her 
with other people, in splendid rooms, where ' the dukes ' 
had possession of her, smiling, satisfied, surrounded, covered 
with jewels. When this vision grew intense he found a 
reassurance in reflecting that after all she would be unlikely 
to throw him personally over so long as she should remain 
mixed up with what was being planned in the dark, 
and that it would not be easy for her to liberate herself 
from that entanglement. She had of course told him 
more, at Medley, of the manner in which she had 
already committed herself, and he remembered, with a 
strange perverse elation, that she had gone very far 
indeed. 

In the intervals of the foolish play Mr. Vetch, who 
lingered in his place in the orchestra while his mates 
descended into the little hole under the stage, leaned 
over the rail and asked his young friend occasional questions, 
carrying his eyes at the same time up about the dingy house, 
at whose smoky ceiling and tarnished galleries he had been 
staring for so many a year. He came back to Hyacinth's 



 

letters, and said, ' Of course you know they were clever ; 
they entertained me immensely. But as I read them I 
thought of poor Pinnie : I wished she could have listened 
to them; they would have made her so happy.' 

'Yes, poor Pinnie,' Hyacinth murmured, while Mr. 
Vetch went on : 

'I was in Paris in 1840; I stayed at a small hotel in 
the Rue Mogador. I judge everything is changed, from 
your letters. Does the Rue Mogador still exist? Yes, 
everything is changed. I daresay it's all much finer, but 
I liked it very much as it was then. At all events, I am 
right in supposing am I not ? that it cheered you up 
considerably, made you really happy.' 

' Why should I have wanted any cheering ? I was 
happy enough,' Hyacinth replied. 

The fiddler turned his old white face upon him ; it had 
the unhealthy smoothness which denotes a sedentary occu- 
pation, thirty years spent in a close crowd, amid the smoke 
of lamps and the odour of stage-paint. ' I thought you 
were sad about Pinnie,' he remarked. 

'When I jumped, with that avidity, at your proposal 
that I should take a tour ? Poor old Pinnie ! ' Hyacinth 
added. 

' Well, I hope you think a little better of the world. We 
mustn't make up our mind too early in life.' 

' Oh, I have made up mine : it's an awfully jolly 
place.'
