"What's the matter with the little one?" he 
asked. 

The soldier dropped the butt of his rifle with 
a ring, and said deferentially: 

"Pardon, Monsieur, but the gamin has been 
here every day and all day for two weeks. It's 
disgusting." 

"Is he hungry?" 



 

"Ma foi? I can't tell you," laughed the sentry, shifting his weight to his right foot and 
leaning on the cross of his bayonet. 

"Are you hungry, little one ?" called Gethryn, 
pleasantly. 

The child raised his head, with a wolfish stare, 
then sank it again, and murmured: "I have seen 
him and touched him." 

Gethryn turned to the soldier: 

"What does he mean by that?" he demanded. 

The sentry shrugged his shoulders. "He 
means he saw a hunchback. They say when 
one sees a hunchback, and touches him, it 
brings good luck, if the hunchback is neither too 
old nor too young. Dame! I don't say there's 
nothing in it, but it can't save Henri Rigaud." 

"And who is Henri Rigaud?" 

"What! Monsieur has not heard of the affair 
Rigaud? Rigaud who did the double murder!" 

"Oh, yes! In the Faubourg du Temple." 

The sentry nodded. "He dies this week." 

"And the child?" 

"Is his." 

Gethryn looked at the dirty little bundle of 
tatters. 





"No one knows the exact day set for the affair, 
but," the sentry sank his voice to a whisper, 
"between you and me, I saw the widow going 
into the yard just before dinner, and Monsieur 
de Paris is here. That means to-morrow morning click!" 

"The the widow?" repeated Gethryn. 

"The guillotine. It will be over before this 
time to-morrow and the gamin there, who thinks 
the bossu will give him back his father, he'll 
find out his mistake, all in good time, all 
in good time!" and shouldering his rifle, the 
sentry laughed and resumed his slouching walk 
before the gateway. 

Gethryn nodded to the soldier's salute, and 
went up to the child, who stood leaning sullenly 
against the wall. 
i "Do you know what a franc is?" he asked. 

The gamin eyed him doggedly. 

"But I saw him," he said. 

"Saw what?" said Gethryn, gently. 

"The bossu," repeated the wretched infant, 
vacantly. 

"See here," said Gethryn, "listen to me. 
What would you do with twenty francs?" 



 

"Eat, all day long, forever!" 
Rex slipped two twenty-franc pieces into the 
filthy little fist. 

"Eat," he murmured, and turned away. 



CHAPTER VII. 

Next morning, when Clifford arrived at the 
Atelier of MM. Boulanger and Lefebvre, he found 
the students more excited than usual over the 
advent of a "Nouveau." 

Hazing at Julien's has assumed, of late, a 
comparatively mild form. Of course there are 
traditions of serious trouble in former years, 
and a few fights have taken place, consequent 
upon the indignant resistance of new men to 
the ridiculous demands forced upon them by 
their ingenious tormentors. Still the hazing 
of to-day is comparatively inoffensive, and there 
is not much of it. In the winter the students 
are too busy to notice a newcomer, except to
