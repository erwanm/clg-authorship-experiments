gushed into his brain--something to break, to rend, to mangle.  He
seized a small sapling, bore it to the ground, put his foot on it and
snapped it with ease.  He did not care that he lacerated his hands or
that the branches flying back scratched his face.  He laughed fiercely.
The Chevalier first, that meddling son of the left-hand whom his father
had had legitimatized; then the vicomte and the poet.  As for
madame . . .  Yes, yes!  That would be it.  That would wring her proud
heart.  Agony long drawn out; agony which turns the hair grey in a
single night.  That would be it.  He could not return to the fort yet;
he must regain his calm.  Money would buy what he wanted, and the ring
on his finger was worth many louis, the only thing of value he had this
side of France.  But it was enough.  A deer fled across his path, and a
partridge blundered into his face.  They had played him the man in the
motley; let them beware of the fool's revenge.

At seven the storm had passed.  Around the mess-table sat the men,
eating.  Victor had thrown his grey cloak over the back of his chair.
Occasionally his glance wandered toward madame and Anne.  Brother
Jacques sat opposite, and the vicomte sat at his side.  As they left
the table to circle round the fire in the living-room, Victor forgot
his cloak, and the vicomte threw it around his own shoulders, intending
to follow the poet and join him in a game of dominoes.  A spurt of
flame crimson-hued his face and flashed over the garment.

Brother Jacques started, his mouth agape.




CHAPTER XXIX

A JOURNEY INTO THE HILLS AND THE TEN LIVRES OF CORPORAL FREMIN

"Madame, you have studiously avoided me."  The vicomte twirled his hat.

"And with excellent reason, you will agree."

"You have been here six days, and you have not given me the barest
chance of speaking to you."  There was a suspicion of drollery in his
reproachful tones.

"Monsieur," replied madame, who, finding herself finally trapped with
no avenue of escape, quickly adapted herself to the situation, the
battle of evasion, "our last meeting has not fully escaped my
recollection."

"All is fair in love and war.  It came near being a good trick,--that
blank paper."

"Not quite so near as might be.  It is true that I did not suspect your
ruse; but it is also true that I had but one idea and one intention, to
gain the paper."

"And supposing it had been real, genuine?"

"Why, then, I should have at least half of it, which would be the same
thing as having all of it."  Contact with this man always put a
delicate edge to her wit and sense of defense.  She could not deny a
particle of admiration for this strange man, who proceeded toward his
ends with the most intricate subterfuge, and who never drew a long
face, who accepted rebuffs with smiles and banter.

"You know, Madame, that whatever I have done or shall do is out of love
for you."

"I would you were out of love with me!"

"The quality of my love . . ."

"Ah, that is what disturbs me--the quality!" shrewdly.

"There is quality and quantity without end.  I am not a lover who pines
and goes without his meals.  Madame, observe me--I kneel.  I tell you
that I adore you.  Will you be my wife?"

"No, a thousand times no!  I know you to be a brave man, Monsieur le
Vicomte; but who can put a finger on your fancy?  To-day it is I;
to-morrow, elsewhere.  You would soon tire of me who could bring you no
dowry save lost illusions and confiscated property.  Doubtless you have
not heard that his Eminence the cardinal has posted seals upon all that
which fell to me through Monsieur de Brissac."

"What penetration!" thought the vicomte, rising and dusting his knees.

"And yet, Monsieur," impulsively, "I would not have you for an enemy."

"One would think that you are afraid of me."

"I am," simply.

"Why?"

"You are determined that I shall love you, and I am equally determined
that I shall not."

"Ah! a matter of the stronger mind and will."

"My will shall never bend toward yours, Monsieur.  What I fear is your
persecution.  Let us put aside love, which is impossible, and turn our
attention to something nearer and quite possible--friendship."  She
extended her hand, frankly, without reservation.  If only she could in
some manner disarm this man!

"What!" mockingly, "you forgive my attempt at Quebec to coerce you?"

"Frankly, since you did not succeed, Monsieur, I have seen too much of
men not to appreciate a brilliant stroke.  Had I not torn that paper
from your hand, you might have scored at least half a trick.  There is
a high place somewhere in this world for a man of your wit and courage."

"Mazarin's interpretation of that would be a gibbet on Montfaucon."

"I am offering you friendship, Monsieur."  The hand remained extended.

The vicomte bowed, placed his hands behind his back and bowed again.
"Friendship and love; oil and water.  Madame, when they mix well, I
will come in the guise of a friend.  Sometimes I've half a mind to tell
the Chevalier who you are; for, my faith! it is humorous in the
extreme.  I understand that you and he were affianced, once upon a
time; and here he is, making violent love to you, not knowing your name
