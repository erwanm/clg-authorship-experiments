" That so ? Well, you look pretty solid. Guess 
I'll put you down at a hundred and twenty." 

" Well, I guess it 's full as much as that," said the 
girl, w r ith a flattered laugh. 

" Dunno how high you are ? " suggested the captain, 
glancing at her again. 

" Well, yes, I do. I am just five feet two inches 
and a half." 

"You don't look it," said the captain critically. 

"Well, I am," insisted the girl, with a returning 
gaiety. 

The captain apparently checked himself and put 
on a professional severity. 

"What business occupation ? " 

" Sales-lady," said the girl. 

"Kesidence?" 

" No. 2334 Pleasant Avenue." 

The captain leaned back in his arm-chair, and 
turned his toothpick between his lips, as he stared 
hard at the girl. 

"Well, now," he said, after a moment, "you know 



 

you've got to come into court and testify to-morrow 
morning." 

" Yes/ said the girl, rather falteringly, with a 
sidelong glance at Lemuel. 

"You've  got to promise to do it, or else it will be 
my duty to have you locked up overnight." 

" Have me locked up ? " gasped the girl, her wide 
blue eyes filling with astonishment. 

"Detain you as a witness," the captain explained. 
"Of course, we shouldn't put you in a cell; we 
should give you a good room, and if you ain't sure 
you'll appear in the morning " 

The girl was not of the sort whose tongues are 
paralysed by terror. " Oh, I'll be sure to appear, 
captain ! Indeed I will, captain ! You needn't 
lock me up, captain ! Lock me up ! " she broke off 
indignantly. "It would be a pretty idea if I was 
first to be robbed of my satchel and then put in 
prison for it overnight ! A great kind of law that 
would be ! Why, I never heard of such a thing ! 
I think it 's a perfect shame ! I want to know if 
that 's the way you do with poor things that you 
don't know about ? " 

" That 's about the size of it," said the captain, 
permitting himself a smile, in which the officer 
joined. 

" Well, it 's a shame ! " cried the girl, now carried 
far beyond her personal interest in the matter. 

The captain laughed outright. "It is pretty 
rough. But what you going to do ? " 

" Do ? Why, I'd " But here she stopped 



 

for want of science, and added from emotion, " I'd 
do anything before I'd do that." 

"Well," said the captain, "then I understand 
you'll come round to the police court and give your 
testimony in the morning ! " 

" Yes," said the girl, with a vague, compassionate 
glance at Lemuel, who had stood there dumb 
throughout the colloquy. 

" If you don t, I shall have to send for you," said 
the captain. 

"Oh, I'll come" replied the girl, in a sort of 
disgust, and her eyes still dwelt upon Lemuel. 

" That 's all," returned the captain, and the girl, 
accepting her dismissal, went out. 

Now that it was too late, Lemuel could break from 
his nightmare. "Oh, don't let her go ! I ain't the 
one ! I was running after a fellow that passed off 
a counterfeit ten-dollar bill on me in the Common 
vesterday. I never touched her satchel. I never 

saw her before " 

"What 's that ? " demanded the captain sharply. 
" You've  got the wrong one ! " cried Lemuel. " I 
never did anything to the girl." 

"Why, you fool !" retorted the cnptain angrily; 
" why didn't you say that when she was here, instead 
of standing there like a dumb animal ? Heigh ? "
