I altogether regret it. I can talk with you a great 
leal better than I could write to you in regard to 
your " Sewell hesitated between the words poems 
and verses, and finally said " work. I have 
blamed myself a great deal," he continued, winc 
ing under the hurt which he felt that he must be 
inflicting on the young man as well as himself, " for 
not being more frank with you when I saw you at 
home in September. I hope your mother is well ? " 

" She 's middling," said Barker, "but my married 
sister that came to live with us since you was there 
has had a good deal of sickness in her family. Her 
husband 's laid up with the rheumatism most of the 
time." 

" Oh ! " murmured Sewell sympathetically. " Well ! 
I ought to have told you at that time that I could 
not see much hope of your doing acceptable work in 
a literary way ; and if I had supposed that you ever 
expected to exercise your faculty of versifying to 
any serious purpose, for anything but your own 



 

pleasure and entertainment, I should certainly have 
done so. And I tell you now that the specimens of 
the long poem you have sent me give me even less 
reason to encourage you than the things you read 
me at home." 

Sewell expected the audible crash of Barker 's air- 
castles to break the silence which the young man 
suffered to follow upon these words ; but nothing of 
the kind happened, and for all that he could see, 
Barker remained wholly unaffected by what he had 
said. It nettled Sewell a little to see him apparently 
so besotted in his own conceit, and he added : "But 
I think I had better not ask you to rely altogether 
upon my opinion in the matter, and I will go with 
you to a publisher, and you can get a professional 
judgment. Excuse me a moment." 

He left the room and went slowly upstairs to his 
wife. It appeared to him a very short journey to 
the third story, where he knew she was decking 
the guest-chamber for the visit of a friend whom 
they expected that evening. He imagined himself 
saying to her when his trial was well over that he 
did not see why she complained of those stairs ; 
that he thought they were nothing at all. But this 
sense of the absurdity of the situation which played 
upon the surface of his distress flickered and fled 
at sight of his wife bustling cheerfully about, and 
he was tempted to go down and get Barker out of 
the house, and out of Boston if possible, without 
letting her know anything of his presence. 

"Well  ?" said Mrs. Sewell, meeting his face of 




perplexity with a penetrating glance. " What is 
it, David ? " 

" Nothing. That is everything ! Lemuel Bar 
ker is here ! " 

"Lemuel Barker? Who is Lemuel Barker?" 
She stood with the pillow-sham in her hand which 
she was just about to fasten on the pillow, and 
Sewell involuntarily took note of the fashion in 
which it was ironed. 

" Why, surely you remember ! That simpleton 
at Willoughby Pastures." If his wife had dropped 
the pillow-sham, and sunk into a chair beside the 
bed, fixing him w r ith eyes of speechless reproach ; 
if she had done anything dramatic, or said anything 
tragic, no matter how unjust or exaggerated, Sewell 
could have borne it ; but she only went on tying 
the sham on the pillow, without a w r ord. " The fact 
is, he wrote to me some weeks ago, and sent me some 
specimens of a long poem." 

"Just before you preached that sermon on the 
tender mercies of the wicked ? " 

"Yes," faltered Sewell. "I had been waiting to 
show you the letter." 

" You waited a good while, David." 

"I know I know," said Sewell miserably. "I 
was waiting waiting He stopped, and then 

added with a burst, " I was waiting till I could put 
it to you in some favourable light." 

"I' m glad you're  honest about it at last, my 
dear ! " 

" Yes. And while I was waiting I forgot Barker 's 



 

letter altogether. I put it away somewhere I 
can't recollect just where, at the moment. But that 
makes no difference ; he 's here with the whole poem 
in his pocket, now." Sewell gained a little courage 
from his wife 's forbearance ; she knew that she 
could trust him in all great matters, and perhaps 
she thought that for this little sin she would not 
add to his punishment. "And what I propose to 
do is to make a complete thing of it, this time.
