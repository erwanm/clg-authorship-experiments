and how hot the sun is here, and how long the 
nights. 

They have sent for her mother, though that 
she does not know. But the letter missed, and 
the telegram was delayed ; it is many days be 
fore she comes, and still Jane moves about the 
room in the cloud of pallid gold. 

One night the doctor stands with his back to 
the bed, talking with Mrs. McMunn. Gypsy 
has a dim idea that they think she is asleep, 
and dimly she seems to hear him say, 

" The case disappoints me. The chances of 
recovery are ve-ry small." 

But she does not think much about it, nor 
care. Presently Jane comes in crying, and she 
wonders what is the matter with her. Perhaps 
she has the headache, too. 

The great brass pendulum has swung up and 
swung down once after that, over the crescent 
of green maples, and then the door is opened 



as nobody has opened the door since Gypsy 
has lain there, and some one lies down softly 
by her on the pillow, and lips touch her fore 
head as no lips have touched her all the sum 
mer long. 

" Ye-es," Gypsy says sleepily; "that is 
nice. My head ached so last night, I cc^ldn't 
talk with you. I ve been a little a horrid 
little villain all this" the thought wanders 
away, and the lips kiss down the words with 
their rare touch, and all the world seems to 
grow cool and green and still. 

After a time, it may be longer or shorter, a 
thought comes to Gypsy; it is sharp and clear; 
it strikes her as if steel struck her, and she cries 
out with it. 

" Oh, mother, mother, mother ! I don't 
want to die ! I don't want to die ! " 

Her mother 's arms just gather her in and 
hold her, and nobody says a word. 

It was Mademoiselle over in her corner, who 
sobbed aloud. Mademoiselle hovers about the 
bed in these days, with red eyes and gentle 



touch ; begs leave to change the ice and bring 
fresh water; sends Jane and the worn mother 
away to rest; insists on taking the night- 
watch and running for the doctor. Poor 
Mademoiselle carries her rosary in her hand, 
and tells over Aves and Paternosters between 
the drops of medicine, wetting the beads with 
tears. 

But by and by the brass pendulum ceases to 
swing over the maple, and the world goes out 




NE morning it moves again a 
little, slowly, faintly ; the 
leaves of the Crescent shine 
out beyond the window ; Jane 's face, and 
every face, glides about again in pallid gold. 

So Gypsy cries for very weakness and thank 
fulness and joy, and cries herself to sleep. 

They do not let her talk for many days, but 
one morning, feeling very br.ght and strong 
after her beef tea, she wakes from a bit of a 
nap, and finds Mademoiselle sitting alone by 
her bed. Mademoiselle is correcting exercise?, 
with her rosary twined about her wrist 



Gypsy watches her for a while in thoughtful 
silence, and suddenly raises herself a little on 
her elbow, and speaks, 

" Mademoiselle ! " 

" Oh ! Why, Miss Gypsy ! You mustn't 
talk, my dear." 

"Yes, I must talk, Mademoiselle. My fate 
cries out against this deaf and dumb treatment, 
and makes each petty artery in this body as 
hardy as the Nemean lion 's nerves ! " (Shake 
speare.) " So, if you please, I want you to 
listen to me, and answer me a question." 

" Very well, my dear ; if la bonne mere will 
not " 

" Oh, la bonne mre won't say a word. 
Now, Mademoiselle, I want to know what ever 
made you take a fancy to such a hor-rid little 
thing, and come in and take care of me this 
way while I ve been sick." 

Mademoiselle drops the exercises, and her 
eyelids quiver a little,
