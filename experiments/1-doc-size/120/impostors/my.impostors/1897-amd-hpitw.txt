serene heavens. 

There were some trifling favors to perform for 
the travellers. He took Miss Esther's arm as the 
train came in, and accompanied her to her chair 
in the^drawing-room coach. Then, a rather hur 
ried good^Bye, Had he any reason to expect any 
more ? 

He drove back, put out his horses, and went 
straight over to the fields. Aunt Hannah began 
at once to clean house, so as to restore the olden 
order before cold weather set in. By night Bessie 
was tired and cross, and Roy went off somewhere, 
leaving them to themselves. Aunt Hannah sat 
and nodded, and Bessie presently flounced off to 
bed. What could one do a whole long winter? 
But if she were mistress here 

Bessie Deane decided that it was the best thing 
she could do. She could think of some more 
desirable positions. A clerk in a store in the city 
would be more to her taste ; but she saw no means 
of getting to that desired haven without some pre- 



 

liminary hardships, which she did not desire to 
take. And though, during the first fortnight here, 
she had believed herself in love with Roy, one of 
the swift, unreasoning, overwhelming fancies, so 
often miscalled love at first sight, she had wavered 
curiously. She had been jealous since ; was not 
that another sign ? Possibly she might meet 
with some one more to her fancy, if she was rich, 
like Miss Otis but would she want to wait five 
or six years like Thirza Rolfe ? Roy Palmer 
wasn't poor ; Aunt Hannah had said he could 
hold up his head with some of the best in town. 
He should, when she was his wife. She would soon 
have him out of these old-fashioned ways. 

Somehow Bessie found imaginary conquests 
much easier than real ones. Roy was deeply 
engrossed with the new road where they were 
surveying, and planning for supplies. There was 
timber to be cut, fences to be moved. Sometimes 
he took his lunch with him. In the evening he 
was tired and abstracted. It had come off quite 
cool, and there was no loitering on the great porch. 
The fire in the sitting-room felt good. Sometimes 
Bessie stole away and played on the piano, but 
the very music was dull when no one came to 
listen. 

Meanwhile the house had been put in order, the 
fall pickling and preserving was done, and Aunt 



 

Hannah one day set the future plainly before 
Bessie. 

" I couldn't leave you enough to take care of 
yourself," she said, "and I may live years yet. 
You can't reasonably expect Royal Palmer, who 
is no kith or kin, to support you ; and any girl 
of spirit would be too proud. I should be ashamed 
of it, myself. I've had a talk with Miss Cummings 
and Mrs. Barstow. Mrs. Barstow will keep you 
through the week ; for it is too far to walk in 
and out, with bad weather coming on presently. 
You'll be able to take good care of yourself in six 
months' time ; I've been talking it over with Roy." 

There was a great lump in Bessie's throat, a hot 
anger in her heart. 

"Oh, if he wants me turned out!" she cried 
passionately. 

" No such thing, Bessie Deane ! He'd be will 
ing to keep you ; but I have some pride, if you 
have not. I've earned my bread since my poor 
father thought fit to share his with a stranger; 
and, surely, you wouldn't want to hang on Roy 
Palmer year in and year out ! There's nothing 
for you to do, but just putter 'round there's not 
enough to keep me busy half the time. Now, if 
you were his kin, instead of mine, I would not raise 
my voice against it. Mrs. Barstow's offer is a good 
one. She does some of the best work in town." 



 

" I shall not go," said the young girl, decisively. 

" What, then ? " Aunt Hannah looked over the 
top of her glasses ; but there was decision in her 
eyes. 

" Well I'll starve first ! I hate the thought of 
dressmaking." Bessie's eyes flashed fire. 

" Perhaps you'd rather live out ? " 

Bessie absolutely screamed in dismay. 

" There, there ! Don't go in a tantrum, Bessie ; 
I am only thinking of your good." 

Her good ! She could give her so many chances 
to see Roy. For a month she had watched her as a 
cat watches a mouse. She did not want her to marry
