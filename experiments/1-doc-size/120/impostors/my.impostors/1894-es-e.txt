among the redskins where he found her, 
had she not had bag upon bag of wampum 
he would have rubbed noses and passed on 
his way. And he will be very sweet to that 
little girl, very loving, very thoughtful, very 
courteous, until it occurs to him that there 
^re other women in the land, that a prince 
acknowledges to himself but one law his 
pleasure, and to his princess but one duty 
neglect. And presently in the grange, re- 
built now and rewardered, yet so far from 
the long grass and palm-trees of home, that 
little girl will sit and weep, and she will sit 
and weep alone." 

The fairy tale was stupid, perhaps, as 
fairy tales are apt to be to one no longer a 
child, but in Bancroft's voice there was so 
much affection that the girl must have for- 
got to yawn. To her eyelids a little con- 
traction had come, and she seemed much 
interested in the hands in her lap. 

" Now, Myrrha," he continued, " look at 
me. You are just as pretty as you can 





stick ; you are in the festival of youth, life 
is all before you ; is it worth while to run 
the risk of ruining that beauty with tears, of 
turning that festival into a threnody, of 
blighting all the years that are before you, 
just for the lack of a bit of ordinary fore- 
sight ? Is it ? Answer me candidly and 
honestly ; is it worth while to run such a 
terrible risk ? " 

" But who said it was ? " And Bancroft 
was gratified with a stare gazelle-like in its 
innocence. 

" To tell the truth, I thought you did, but 
I am glad to discover that I am in error. 
You see, I thought you had agreed to be- 
come Prince Charming's bride." 

" Well, supposing I have, what then ? " 

" Then that agreement must remain in 
abeyance until " 

"Oh, pooh! Until what? Until you 
have had a chance to look over the Peer- 
age, I suppose. Well, look it over ; there 
it is." 

" Until I have had time to communicate 





with Sir Julian Pauncefote and hear from 
England as well." 

" And suppose I refuse ? " 

" But you won't refuse. You have too 
much common sense to refuse ; and if 
Cloden be the man I take him to be, he will 
facilitate my investigations in every way." 

" But what are you to investigate ? I 
dare say he has been wicked all men are, 
aren't they ? and I dare say he has debts 
I never heard of an Englishman that hadn't, 
did you ? But these are matters which con- 
cern no one but him and me. If you are 
going to ask to look at his diary, I think he 
would be a fool to show it." 

" And so do I," Bancroft answered dryly. 
" I agree with you in every particular. I 
don't want his diary ; I want his record^ 
I want to know primo, is he here after your 
blue eyes, or is he after your wampum ? " 

Visibly the girl was sitting on the pins 
and needles of impatience, but at this she 
laughed outright. 

" I knew it, Arthur. I knew you would 





say that. Oh, I have been waiting for it, 
and now I have got you he doesn't know 
that I have a penny" 

" What ! " 

" Primo, as you say, how should he ? I 
didn't know it myself until you told me. 
He has been in this country but seven days, 
and five he has passed at the Logerot. The 
letter he got for Aunt Adelaide was given 
before father died. Since then he has been 
in Brazil. Why, Brazil is as far as another 
planet. There was no one there to tell him, 
and since he has been here he has met no 
one who could. Is that enough for primo ? 
It is, is it ? Now for secundo. He has told 
me everything about himself, everything ; 
about Eton, about Oxford, about his regiment, and about his people. He told me 
that his grandfather had been very extravagant, his father also ; that it had been arranged he was to marry his second cousin,
