"Well, they have got some other things here. Mother, the cabbages don't 
look nice." Then soon after coming to a small market store, Rotha must 
stand still to look. 

"They are a little better here," she judged. "Mother, mother! they have 
got everything at this market. Do see! there are fish, and oysters, and 
clams; and eggs; and what are those queer things?" 

"Lobsters." 

"What are they good for?" 

"To eat." 

"They don't look as if they were good for anything. Mother, one could get 
a very good dinner here." 

"With plenty of money." 

"Does it take much?--to get one dinner?" 

"Are you hungry?" said her mother, smiling faintly. "It takes a good deal 
of money to get anything in New York, Rotha." 

"Then I am afraid we ought to have staid at Medwayville." 

A conclusion which almost forced itself upon Mrs. Carpenter's mind. For 
the business of finding a lodging that would suit her and that she could 
pay for, soon turned out to be one of difficulty. She and Rotha grew 
weary of walking, and more weary of looking at rooms that would suit them 
which they could not pay for, and other rooms which they could pay for 
and that would not do. All the houses in New York seemed to come under 
one or the other category. From one house agency to another, and from 
these to countless places referred to, advertised for hire, the mother 
and daughter wandered; in vain. One or the other difficulty met them in 
every case. 

"What will you do, mother, if you cannot find a place?" Rotha asked, the 
evening of the first day. "Go back to Medwayville?" 

"We cannot go back." 

"Then we must find a place," said Rotha. 

And driven by this necessity, so they did. The third day, well tired in 
body and much more in mind, they did at last find what would do. It was a 
long walk from their hotel, and seemed endless. No doubt, in the country, 
with grass under their feet, or even the well beaten foot track beside 
the highway, neither mother nor daughter would have thought anything of 
the distance; but here the hard pavement wearied them, and the way 
measured off by so many turns and crossings and beset with houses and 
human beings, seemed a forlorn pilgrimage into remote regions. Besides, 
it left the pleasanter part of the city and went, as Rotha remarked, 
among poor folks. Down Bleecker St. till it turned, then following the 
new stretch of straight pavement across Carmine St., and on and on into 
the parts then called Chelsea. On till they came to an irregular open 
space. 

"This must be Abingdon Square," said the mother. 

"It isn't square at all," Rotha objected. 

"But this must be it. Then it's only one street more, Rotha. Look for 
Jane Street." 

Beyond Abingdon Square Jane Street was found to be the next crossing. 
They turned the corner and were at the place they sought. 

The region was not one of miserable poverty and tenant houses. Better 
than that; and the buildings being low and small did not darken the 
streets, as Mrs. Carpenter had found in some parts of the city. A decent 
woman, a mantua-maker, had the house and offered Mrs. Carpenter the 
second floor; two little rooms and a closet off them. The rooms were 
furnished after a sort; but Mrs. Marble could give no board with them; 
only lodging. She was a bright, sharp little woman. 

"Yes, I couldn't," she said. "It wouldn't pay. I couldn't mind my 
business. I take my meals in a corner; for I couldn't have grease and 
crumbs round; but where one person can stand, three can't sit. You'll 
have to manage that part yourself. It'll be cheaper for you, too." 

"Is anything cheap here?" Mrs. Carpenter asked wearily. She had sat down 
to rest and consider. 

"That's how you manage it," said the other, shewing a full and rather 
arch smile. She was a little woman, quick and alert in all her ways and 
looks. "My rooms aint dear, to begin with; and you needn't ruin yourself 
eating; if you know how." 

"I knew how in the country," said Mrs. Carpenter. "Here it is different." 

"Aint it! I guess it is. Rents, you see; and folks must live, landlords 
and all. Some of 'em do a good deal more; but that aint my lookout. I'd 
eat bread and salt sooner than I'd be in debt; and I never do be that. Is 
it only you two?" 

"That is all." 

"Then you needn't to worry. I guess you'll get along." 

For Mrs. Marble noticed the quiet respectability of her caller, and 
honestly thought what she said. Mrs. Carpenter reflected. The rooms were 
not high; she could save a good deal by the extra trouble of providing 
herself; she would be more private, and probably have things better to 
her liking. Besides, her very soul sickened at the thought of looking for 
any more rooms. She decided, and took these. Then she asked about the 
possibilities of getting work. Mrs. Marble's countenance grew more 
doubtful. 

"Plain sewing?" she said. "Well, there's a good many folks doing that, 
you see." 

"I thought, perhaps, you could put me in the way of some." 

"Well, perhaps I can. I'll see what I can think of. But there's a many 
doing that sort o' thing. They're in every other house, almost. Now, when 
will you come?" 

"To-morrow. I suppose I cannot tell what I want to get till I do come."
