house; and down in another corner Mr. and Mrs. Purcell have their kitchen 
and a little sleeping place off it; all the rest is desert." 
"Who are Mr. and Mrs. Purcell?" 
"Aunt Serena's tenants--farmers--I do not know what to call them. They 
might be servants, but they are not that exactly." 
"Do you mean that there is no other person in the house?" 
"No other person." 
Mr. Southwode began to go forward again, slowly, looking at everything as 
he went. 
"What do you hear from your aunt?" 
"Nothing. O yes, I have had one scrap of a note from her; some time ago; 
but it told me nothing:" 
"Have you written to her?" 
"Over and over; till I was tired." 
"Have you written to no one else?" 
"Why of course! I wrote to Mrs. Mowbray, again and again; and to one or 
two of the girls; but I never got an answer. The whole world has seemed 
dead, and been dead, for me." 
They slowly paced by the house, and began to go down the sweep towards 
the other gate. 
"Alone with these two servants for five months!" Mr. Southwode said. 
"Rotha, what sort of a life have you been living all this while?" 
"I do not know," said the girl catching her breath. "Rather queer. I 
suppose it has been good for me." 
"What makes you suppose that?" 
"I think I can feel that it has."--But Rotha added no more. 
"Is confidence between us not fully reestablished?" he asked with a 
smile. 
"O yes--if you care to know," Rotha answered hesitatingly, at the same 
time finding herself ready to slide back into the old habit of being very 
open with him. 
"I care to know--if you like to tell me." 
"It has been a queer life," she repeated. "I have been living between two 
things, my Bible, and the garden. There was an interval of some weeks not 
long ago, when Mrs. Purcell was sick; and then I lived largely in the 
kitchen." 
"Go on, and tell me--But how can you go on!" Mr. Southwode found himself 
approaching the gate and road again, and suddenly broke off. "I cannot 
keep you standing here by the hour, and a little time will not do for us. 
Pray, if you have no place to take me to, where do you yourself live?" 
The laughing glance that came to him now was precisely another of the 
child's looks that he remembered; a look that recognized his sympathy, 
and answered it out of a fund of heart treasure. 
"I live between my corner at the top of the house, and Mrs. Purcell's 
corner at the bottom. I have no place but my room and her kitchen." 
"Where can I see you? We have a great deal to talk about. Rotha, suppose 
you go for a drive with me?" 
Rotha's eyes sparkled. "It would not be the first time," she said. 
"No. Then the next question is, when can we go?" He looked at his watch. 
"It is too late for this afternoon," Rotha opined. 
"I am afraid it is. I do not think we can manage it. Then--Rotha, will 
you be ready to-morrow morning? How early can you be ready?" 
"We have breakfast about half past six." 
"We?" 
"Yes," said Rotha half laughing. "We. That is, Mr. Purcell, and his wife, 
and myself." 
"Do you take your meals with these people?" 
Rotha nodded. "And in their kitchen. It is the only place." 
"But they are not--What are they?" 
"Not what you would call refined persons," said Rotha, while again the 
laugh of amusement and pleasure in her eyes shone through an iris of 
sudden tears. "No--they have been kind to me, though, in their way." 
"As kind as their allegiance to Mrs. Busby permitted," said Mr. Southwode 
drily, recognizing at the same time the full beauty of this look I have 
tried to describe. "Well! That is over. How early to-morrow will you be 
ready to come away?" 
"To come away?" repeated Rotha. "For a drive, you mean?" 
"For a drive from this place. It is not my purpose ever to bring you back 
again." 
The colour darted vividly into Rotha's cheeks, and a corresponding flash 
came to her eye. Yet she stood still and silent, while the colour went 
and came. Never here again? Then whither? and under what guardianship? 
His own? There came a great heart leap of joy at this suggestion, but 
with it came also a vague pull-back of doubt; the origin of which 
probably lay in words she had heard long ago and never forgotten, the 
tendency of which was to throw scruples in the way of such an arrangement 
or to cast some slur upon it. Was there an echo of them in Rotha's young 
consciousness? She did feel that she was a child no longer; that there 
was a difference since the old time. Yet she was still as simple, nearly, 
as a child; and of that sort of truth in her own heart which readily 
believes truth in others. Mr. Digby's truth she knew. Altogether there 
was a confusion of thoughts within her, which he saw, though he did not 
read. 
"Do you owe anything to these people here?" he asked, a sudden question 
rising in his mind. 
"Owe? To Mr. Purcell and his wife? No. I owe them for a good deal of 
kindness. O! you mean--Yes, in one sense I owe them. I have never paid 
them anything." 
"For your board, and their care of you?" 
"No.--I do not owe them for much care," said Rotha smiling. "I have  
taken care of myself since I have been here." 
"Do I understand you? Has nobody paid them anything for your stay here?" 
"Nobody." 
"Upon what footing were you here, then?" 
"It has no name," said Rotha contentedly. She could be gay now over this 
anomalous past. "I do not know what to call it." 
"Has your aunt allowed you to depend upon these people?" 
"Yes. I have not really depended upon them, Mr. Southwode. I promised 
myself, and I promised Mrs. Purcell, that some day, if I ever could do 
it, I would live to pay her. If I could have got any work to do, I would 
have taken it, and paid her before now; but I had no chance. I could see 
nobody." 
"How literally is that to be taken?" 
"With absolute literalness. I have seen nobody but Mr. and Mrs. Purcell 
since I came here. Began almost to think I never should." 
"But Sundays?" 
"What of Sundays?" 
"Did you not go to church somewhere?" 
"Yes," said Rotha smiling; "in my pleasant corner room at the top of the 
house. Nowhere else." 
"Why not?" 
"It is not the habit of the people. And their habit, I found, I could not 
change." 
"What did you do with your Sundays?" 
"Spent them alone with my Bible. And often they were very, very pleasant; 
though I found it difficult to keep up such study all alone, through the 
long days." 
"I must not let you stand here any longer! Will you be ready for me at 
eleven o'clock to-morrow?" 
"Yes. There is no difficulty in that."
