Branches Castle on the following Tuesday. " I 
think I have made up a very pleasant party," 
the young nobleman said. "Several people 
whom you know, and my mother and sisters, who 
have so long been regrettably prevented from 
making your acquaintance." Bessie Alden lost 
no time in calling her sister 's attention to the in 
justice she had done the Duchess of Bayswater, 
whose hostility was now proved to be a vain illusion. 

"Wait till you see if she comes," said Mrs. 
Westgate. "And if she is to meet us at her 



  

son 's house the obligation was all the greater for 
her to call upon us." 

Bessie had not to wait long, and it appeared 
that Lord Lambeth 's mother now accepted Mrs. 
Westgate 's view of her duties. On the morrow, 
early in the afternoon, two cards were brought to 
the apartment of the American ladies one of 
them bearing the name of the Duchess of Bays- 
water, and the other that of the Countess of Pimlico. Mrs. Westgate glanced at the clock. "It 
is not yet four," she said ; " they have come early ; they wish to see us. We will receive them." 
And she gave orders that her visitors should be 
admitted. A few moments later they were introduced, and there was a solemn exchange of 
amenities. The Duchess was a large lady, with a 
fine fresh color ; the Countess of Pimlico was 
very pretty and elegant. 

The Duchess looked about her as she sat 
down looked not especially at Mrs. Westgate. 
" I dare say my son has told you that I have 
been wanting to come and see you," she ob 
served. 

"You are very kind," said Mrs. Westgate, 
vaguely her conscience not allowing her to as 
sent to this proposition and, indeed, not permitting her to enunciate her own with any appreci 
able emphasis. 





" He says you were so kind to him in America," said the Duchess. 

"We are very glad," Mrs. Westgate replied, 
" to have been able to make him a little more a 
little less a little more comfortable." 

" I think he staid at your house," remarked 
the Duchess of Bayswater, looking at Bessie Al- 
den. 

" A very short time^" said Mrs. Westgate. 

" Oh !" said the Duchess ; and she continued to 
look at Bessie, who was engaged in conversation 
with her daughter. 

"Do you like London ?" Lady Pimlico had asked of Bessie, after looking at her a good deal 
at her face and her hands, her dress and hei 
hair. 

" Very much indeed," said Bessie. 

"Do you like this hotel?" 

" It is very comfortable," said Bessie. 

" Do you like stopping at hotels ?" inquired 
Lady Pimlico, after a pause. 

"I am very fond of travelling," Bessie answered, "and I suppose hotels are a necessary 
part of it. But they are not the part I am fond 
est of." 

" Oh, I hate travelling," said the Countess of 
Pimlico, and transferred her attention to Mrs. 
Westgate. 



  

" My son tells me you are going to Branches, ' 
the Duchess presently resumed. 

"Lord Lambeth has been so good as to ask 
us," said Mrs. Westgate, who perceived that her 
visitor had now begun to look at her, and who 
had her customary happy consciousness of a distinguished appearance. The only mitigation of 
her felicity on this point was that, having inspected her visitor 's own costume, she said to herself, " She won 't know how well I am dressed !" 

" He has asked me to go, but I am not sure I 
shall be able," murmured the Duchess. 

" He had offered us the p the prospect of 
meeting you," said Mrs. Westgate. 

" I hate the country at this season," responded 
the Duchess. 

Mrs. Westgate gave a little shrug. " I think 
it is pleasanter than London." 

But the Duchess 's eyes were absent again ; she 
was looking very fixedly at Bessie. In a moment 
she slowly rose, walked to a chair that stood empty at the young girl 's right hand, and silently seated herself. As she was a majestic, voluminous 
woman, this little transaction had, inevitably, an 
air of somewhat impressive intention. It diffused 
a certain awkwardness, which Lady Pimlico, as a 
sympathetic daughter, perhaps desired to rectify 
in turning to Mrs. Westgate.
