in profound mystery." 

I covered my face with my hands. That she should 
bring these precious tidings to me ! 

"I almost believe you wrote it yourself, and yet I 
never thought of that before. Confess ! " 

Her voice had a certain exultant ring that inspired me. 

" It is mine," I said under my breath, scarcely daring to 
lay claim to it. 

"My darling!" and with a glad cry there came a rain 
of kisses upon my forehead, baptizing me afresh. O, 
blessed sympathy of friendship, with the bliss, but not the 
torture nor wild desires of love ! And then we clasped 
hands in that cordial tenderness that needs no words, but 
is a language unto itself. 

" How blind I must have been ! Nay, I think I had a 
dim perception that in it I saw your soul. When you 



 

taught these earnest-, glowing truths, my dear friend, had 
they no voice for you ?" 

"Anne," I rejoined, *' I have suffered much bitter self- 
upbraiding. I wrote the book in spells of something that 
appears to me now like inspiration. The rest of my life 
was wretched and dreary in the -extreme. I had reached 
that utter weariness of heart and soul when all is black 
unbelief. I wanted fame success. Pride was my domi- 
nant ruler apd guide. I have been justly punished." 

" But you have achieved success ! Why, the book is 
everybody's admiration. You have only to confess, and 
you will find yourself famous," 

Sweet words from the lips of love. Nothing ever 
thrills one so completely as that sense of first triumph, all 
the dearer and more satisfying for the many hours of de- 
spair that had preceded it. But my eyes filled with tears, 
rapturous, yet strangely sad, and for many moments we 
were both silent. 

"I must hear all," Anne said at length. "How well 
you kept your secret ! yet I shall have to exercise a good 
deal of Christian charity in order to forgive you for shut- 
ting me out of your confidence." 

I told her the whole story. It appeared* strange even 
to myself. Anne's sympathy was unbounded; more than 
once I saw the tears softly falling. 

"O, my darling, how you have suffered!" she said at 
length, with a tremulous sob. 

" You must not pity me, nor help me to make a martyr 
of myself, I am done with that forever. I turned wil- 
fully away from the light, and God allowed me to wander 
in the darkness of my own making." 

"I think there is a time in nearly all our lives when We 
go into the wilderness, and are tempted of the devil. It is 
only by keeping close to God that we escape." 
 



 

I understood the peculiar light in her tender eyes. She, 
too, had known the anguish, the passion, and pain of 
standing a brief while without the portals of hope. 

But the marvels for the day were not ended. I received 
a brief letter from Mrs. Ellingwood, expressing much regret 
that I would not be able to resume my place, and offering 
to wait a month. She enclosed a letter that had come 
while she was away, and had been mislaid. It was from 
my publishers. They were very much encouraged at the 
late success of my book, and proposed that I should come 
to New York, if it was convenient, as there were several 
points in the business they wished to discuss with me. 
It had been written a month before. 

I was too tired and excited to sleep well that night, 
yet was not materially worse the next day. Some time 
elapsed before we recovered our nsual serenity ; indeed, 
the whole course of my life appeared changed. New 
plans and aims haunted me continually; but I tried to 
keep my expectations within bounds. It was only one 
little step in a long journey. 

I made arrangements to go to New York as soon as 
possible, asking Mrs. Westervelt to take me in during my 
stay, to which she readily agreed. I longed to see the 
Bweet, motherly face again. She was very lonesome, 
missing the society of Philip and Ellen very much. They 
did not expect to return until mid-winter. 

Anne was loath to have me go, but she yielded her de- 
sires in her own sweet fashion. Her brother Walter had 
been in Italy nearly a year, and was making rapid im- 
provement in health as well as art. " I shall have an in- 
terest in two famous people," she said, with her bright 
smile. 

I found that Mrs. Westervelt had lost none of her 
charms. I wag the better able to appreciate the exceed- 



 

ing loveliness of her character, and the refined and tender
