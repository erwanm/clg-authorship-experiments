when the shutters were down, much like 
those in a Cairo bazaar, and all the 
goods were in sight. The shopkeepers 
stood in front and cried their wares, 
and besought customers. Until 1568 
there were but few silk shops in Lon- 
don, and all those were kept by women. 
It was not till about that time that 
citizens' wives ceased to wear white knit 




 

woollen caps, and three-square Minever 
caps with peaks. In the beginning of 
Elizabeth's reign the apprentices (a 
conspicuous class) wore blue cloaks in 
winter and blue gowns in summer; un- 
less men were threescore years old, it 
was not lawful to wear gowns lower 
than the calves of the legs, but the 
length of cloaks was not limited. The 
journeymen and apprentices wore long 
daggers in the daytime at their backs 
or sides. When the apprentices at- 
tended their masters and mistresses in 
the night they carried lanterns and can- 
dles, and a great long club on the neck. 
These apprentices were apt to lounge 
with their clubs about the fronts of 
shops, ready to take a hand in any 
excitement â€” to run down a witch, or 
raid an objectionable house, or tear 
down a tavern of evil repute, or spoil 
a playhouse. The high - streets, espe- 




 

cially in winter-time, were annoyed by 
hourly frays of sword and buckler men ; 
but these were suddenly suppressed 
when the more deadly fight with rapier 
and dagger came in. The streets were 
entirely unlighted and dangerous at 
night, and for this reason the plays at 
the theatres were given at three in the 
afternoon. 

About Shakespeare's time many new 
inventions and luxuries came in : masks, 
muffs, fans, periwigs, shoe-roses, love- 
handkerchiefs (tokens given by maids 
and gentlewomen to their favorites), 
heath -brooms for hair-brushes, scarfs, 
garters, waistcoats, flat-caps; also hops, 
turkeys, apricots, Venice glass, tobacco. 
In 1524, and for years after, was used 
this rhyme : * 

" Turkeys, Carpes, Hops : Piccarel, and beere, 
Came into England : all in one year."

There were no coffee-houses as yet, for 
neither tea nor coffee was introduced 
till about 1661. Tobacco was first made 
known in England by Sir John Haw- 
kins in 1565, though not commonly 
used by men and women till some years 
after. It was urged as a great medicine 
for many ills. Harrison says, 1573, "In 
these days the taking in of the smoke 
of the Indian herb called ' Tabaco,' by 
an instrument formed like a little ladle, 
whereby it passeth from the mouth 
into the head and stomach, is greatly 
taken up and used in England, against 
Rewmes and some other diseases en- 
gendered in the lungs and inward parts, 
and not without effect." Its use spread 
rapidly, to the disgust of James I. and 
others, who doubted that it was good 
for cold, aches, humors, and rheums. 
In 1614 it was said that seven thousand 
houses lived by this trade, and that 




 

^"399,375 a year was spent in smoke. 
Tobacco was even taken on the stage. 
Every base groom must have his pipe ; 
it was sold in all inns and ale-houses, 
and the shops of apothecaries, grocers, 
and chandlers were almost never, from 
morning till night, without company 
still taking, of tobacco. 

There was a saying on the Continent 
that " England is a paradise for women, 
a prison for servants, and a hell or pur- 
gatory for horses." The society was 
very simple compared with the complex 
condition of ours, and yet it had more 
striking contrasts, and was a singular 
mixture of downrightness and artifici- 
ality; plainness and rudeness of speech 
went with the utmost artificiality of 
dress and manner. It is curious to
