“How queer it is!” thought Debby. 
“What could make her come to a festival 
with no shoes?” Then, as they walked 
on, suddenly Debby began to think of 
something else: — 

“Who are they whose little feet, 

Pacing life’s dark journey through, 

Now have reach’d that heavenly seat 
They had ever kept in view ?” 




“ Red shoes or no shoes, it doesn’t make 
much difference,” Debby repeated to herself, thinking of her mother’s words. And 
yet it seemed to make a good deal, too. 

“ I wonder which way she’s walking?” 
thought Debby again. “I guess I’ll ask 
her. Jane, do you know how to walk 
well?” 

“I don’t know — I think I don’t know — 
what you mean,” Jane answered, colouring. 
For she had been watching Debby ’s red 
shoes, too, and thought that may -be Debby 
was laughing at her bare feet. 

“Well, which way are you going, then?” 
said Debby. 

“I’m going up to the festival,” said 
Jane, quietly. “ Mrs. Singleton told me to 
come.” 

“Is that all?” said Debby. 

“ Yes,” said Jane, “that’s all. I knew 
I might come if she told me to. I guess 




they've all got shoes but me ; — but I 
couldn’t help that. We’re too poor to wear 
shoes in summer.” 

“Oh, but, ’ ’ said Debby, ‘ ‘ my mother says 
it don’t make much difference.” 

“I think it does make some,” said Jane, 
looking down again at the little red shoes. 
“I think it makes a good deal.” 

“No, it don’t,” said Debby, “if you 
only walk well.” 

Jane looked at her own bare feet this 
time, plodding on as before, and wondered 
what in the world Debby meant. 

“ I can get along fast enough,” she said, 
“but it a’n’t so pretty to look at.” 

“Oh, but I don’t mean that, at all,” 
said Debby. “Why, didn’t you ever hear 
about the little travellers?” 

Jane looked up, and a smile came over 
her face. 

“‘Little Travellers Zionward?  ” she 



said. “Oh, yes, to be sure. I know all 
about that. I mean, I know something.” 
“But what makes you stop and take 
back your words so?” said Debby. “A 
little while ago you said, ‘ I don’t know — 
I think I don’t know;’ and now, again.’' 
“I spoke too fast,” said Jane. “I spoke 
as if I was sure ; and I wasn’t. And just 
now I said I knew all about the little 
travellers; but, oh, I know so little! I 
spoke too fast to speak quite true.” 

Then thought Debby to herself, “ I 
guess that’s what mother meant by walking in the truth. ” “Well, what do you know 
about ’em, Jane?” she said aloud. “ Because I know a good deal, and I can tell 
you.” 

“Do you?” said Jane, putting her hand 
in Debby’s. “Then I wish you would tell 
me. You know, Debby, the Bible says 
we ought to walk even as Jesus walked; 



and sometimes it seems to me as if I walked 
just the other way. Do you ever feel so ? 
Now, if I loved Jesus as he loves me, I 
think my heart would run to him all the 
time.” 

Debby was puzzled in her turn. Here 
was something about little travellers which 
went quite beyond her knowledge. 

“Do you love Jesus?” she said, looking 
out from under her sunbonnet. 

“Oh, yes!” Jane answered: “we all do 
at home. We should be dreadfully poor 
if it wasn’t for that.”
