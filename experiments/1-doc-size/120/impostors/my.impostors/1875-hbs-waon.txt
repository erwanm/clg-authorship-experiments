know, Aunty, I am such a perfect ignoramus about these matters."

And Eva tripped up stairs, congratulating herself on turning the
subject, and putting her aunt's busy advising faculties to some
harmless and innocent use. So, when she came down with her two pieces
of linen, Aunt Maria tested and pulled them this way and that, in the
approved style of a domestic expert, and gave judgment at last with an
authoritative air.

"This is the best, Eva--you see it has a round thread, and very
little dressing."

"And why is the round thread the best, Aunty?"

"Oh, because it always is--everybody knows that, child; all good
judges will tell you to buy the round threaded linen, that's perfectly
well understood."

Eva did not pursue the inquiry farther, and we must all confess that
Mrs. Wouverman's reply was about as satisfactory as those one gets
to most philosophical inquiries as to why and wherefore. If our
reader doubts that, let him listen to the course of modern arguments
on some of the most profound problems; so far as can be seen, they
consist of inflections of Aunt Maria's style of statement--as, "Oh,
of course everybody knows that, now;" or, negatively, "Oh, nobody
believes that, now-a-days." Surely, a mode of argument which very
wise persons apply fearlessly to subjects like death, judgment and
eternity, may answer for a piece of linen.

"Oh, by-the-by, Eva, I see you have cards there for Mrs. Wat Sydney's
receptions this winter," said Aunt Maria, turning her attention to the
card plate. "They are going to be very brilliant, I'm told. They say
nothing like their new house is to be seen in this country."

"Yes," said Eva, "Sophie has been down here urging me to come up and
see her rooms, and says they depend on me for their receptions, and
I'm going up some day to lunch with her, in a quiet way; but Harry and
I have about made up our minds that we sha'n't go to parties. You
know, Aunty, we are going in for economy, and this sort of thing costs
so much."

"But, bless your soul, child, what is money for?" said Aunt Maria,
innocently. "If you have any thing you ought to improve your
advantages of getting on in society. It's important to Harry in his
profession to be seen and heard of, and to push his way among the
notables, and, with due care and thought and economy, a person with
your air and style, and your taste, can appear as well as anybody. I
came down here, among other things, to look over your dresses, and
see what can be done with them."

"Oh, thank you a thousand times, Aunty dear, but what do you think all
my little wedding finery would do for me in an assemblage of Worth's
spick-and-span new toilettes? In our own little social circles I am
quite a leader of the mode, but I should look like an old last night's
bouquet among all their fresh finery!"

"Well, now, Eva, child, you talk of economy and all that, and then go
spending on knick-knacks and mere fancies what would enable you to
make a very creditable figure in society."

"Really, Aunty, is it possible now, when I thought we were being so
prudent?"

"Well, there's your wood fire, for instance; very cheerful, I admit,
but it's a downright piece of extravagance. I know that the very
richest and most elegant people, that have everything they can think
of, have fallen back on the fancy of having open wood fires in their
parlors, just for a sort of ornament to their rooms, but you don't
really need it--your furnace keeps you warm enough."

"But, Aunty, it looks so bright and cheerful, and Harry is so fond of
it! We only have it evenings, when he comes home tired, and he says
the very sight of it rests him."

"There you go, now, Eva--with wood at fifteen dollars a cord!--going
in for a mere luxury just because it pleases your fancy, and you can't
go into society because it's so expensive. Eva, child, that's just
like you. And there are twenty other little things that I see about
here," said Aunt Maria, glancing round, "pretty enough, but each costs
a little. There, for instance, those cut flowers in the vases cost
something."

"But, Aunty, I got them of a poor little man just setting up a
green-house, and Harry and I have made up our minds that it's our duty
to patronize him. I'm going up to Sophie's to get her to take flowers
for her parties of him."

"It's well enough to get Sophie to do it, but you oughtn't to afford
it," said Aunt Maria; "nor need you buy a new matting and pictures for
your servant's room."

"Oh, Aunty, mattings are so cheap; and those pictures didn't cost
much, and they make Mary so happy!"

"Oh, she'd be happy enough any way. You ought to look out a little for
yourself, child."

"Well, I do. Now, just look at the expense of going to parties. To
begin with, it annihilates all your dresses, at one fell swoop. If
I make up my mind, for instance, not to go to parties this winter,
I have dresses enough and pretty enough for all my occasions. The
minute I decide I must go, I have nothing, absolutely nothing, to
wear. There must be an immediate outlay. A hundred dollars would be a
small estimate for all the additions necessary to make me appear with
credit. Even if I take my old dresses as the foundation, and use my
unparalleled good taste, there are trimmings, and dressmaker's bills,
and gloves, and slippers, and fifty things; and then a carriage for
the evening, at five dollars a night, and all for what? What does
anybody get at a great buzzing party, to pay for all this? Then Harry
has to use all his time, and all his nerves, and all his strength on
his work. He is driven hard all the time with writing, making up the
paper, and overseeing at the office. And you know parties don't begin
till near ten o'clock, and if he is out till twelve he doesn't rest
well, nor I either--it's just so much taken out of our life--and we
don't either of us enjoy it. Now, why should we put out our wood fire
that we do enjoy, and scrimp in our flowers, and scrimp in our home
comforts, and in our servant's comforts, just to get what we don't
want after all?"

"Oh, well, I suppose you are like other new married folks, you want to
