of good and eaten of evil, so that there is no whole 
part in us. 

" And yet we move not to save ourselves, though 
Christ gave His life to save us if we would stir 
ever so little, if we would but stretch out our hands 
to the hand that waits for ours. He bids us not be 
crucified, as He was for us. He bids us only take up 
our cross and follow Him, as He took it up Himself, 
and bore it to the place of death." 

Thus Bernard began to speak, gently at first, as 
one who rouses a friend from sleep to warn him of 
danger, and fears to be rough, yet cannot be silent; 
but by and by, in the breathing stillness, the sweet 
voice was strengthened and rang like the first clarion 
at dawn on the day of battle, far off and clear, heart- 
stirring and true. And with the rising tone came 
also the stronger word, and at last the spirit that 
moves more than word or voice. 

"Lay the Cross to your hearts as you wear it on 
your breasts. Bear it with you on the long day 



 

marches, and in the watches of night bow before it 
inwardly, and pray that you may have grace to bear 
it to the end. So shall your footsteps profit you, 
and your way shall be the way of the Cross, till you 
stand in the holy place. But if so be that God 
ask blood of you, blessed shall they be among you 
who shall give life freely, to die for the Cross 
of our Lord Christ; and they shall stand in the 
place that is holy indeed, before the Throne of 
God. 

" Yet beware of one thing. I would not that you 
should go out to fight for the Sepulchre as some of 
our fathers did, boasting in the Cross, yet in heart 
each for his own soul and none for the glory of 
Christ, counting the weariness, and the hurts, and 
the drops of blood as a sure reckoning to be repaid 
to you in heaven, as if you had lent God a piece of 
money which He must pay again. The Lord Jesus 
gave not His life at an account, nor His blood at 
usury ; He counted not the pain, nor was His suffer- 
ing set down in a book; but He gave all freely, of 
His love for men. Shall men therefore ask of God 
a return, saying : ' We have given Thee so much, as 
it were a wound, or it may be a life, or else a prayer, 
and a day of fasting, see that Thou pay us what is 
just ' ? That were not giving to God what is a man's 
own ; it were rather lending or selling to God what 
is His. See that you do not thus, but if you have 
anything to give, let it be given freely; or else 
give not at all, for it is written that from him that 
hath not faith shall be taken even such things as 
he hath. 





"But if you take the Cross, and arm yourselves 
to fight for it, and go your way to Palestine to help 
your brethren in their sore need, go not for your- 
selves, suffer not for yourselves, fight not for your- 
selves. For as God is greater than man, so is the 
glory of God greater than the glory of self and more 
worthy that you should die for it. Think not 
therefore of earning a reward, but of honouring 
the Lord Christ in the holy place where He died 
for you. 

"March not as it were to do penance for your 
old sins, hoping for forgiveness, as a trader that 
brings merchandise looks for a profit! Strike 
not as slaves, who fight lest they be beaten with 
rods, neither as men in fear of everlasting fire 
and the torments of hell! Neither go out as 
thieves, seeking to steal the earth for yourselves, 
and striving not with the unbeliever, but with 
the rich man for his riches, and with the great 
man for his possessions ! I say, go forth and do 
battle for God's sake and His glory ! March ye 
for Christ and to bring the people to Him out of 
darkness ! Take with you the Cross to set it in the 
hearts of men, and the seed of the tree of Life to 
plant among desolate nations! 

" Ye kings, that are anointed leaders, lead ye the 
armies of Heaven I Ye knights, that are sworn to 
honour, draw your unsullied swords for the honour 
of God ! Men and youths, that bear arms by alle- 
giance, be ye soldiers of Christ and allegiant to the 
Cross ! Be ye all first for honour, first for France, 
first for God Most High ! " 




 

With those words the white-sleeved arm was high 
above his head, holding up the plain white wooden 
cross, and there was silence for a moment. But 
when the people saw that he had finished speaking, 
they drew deep breath, and the air thundered with 
the great cry that came. 

" Crosses I Give us crosses ! " 

And they pressed upon one another to get nearer. 
The King had risen, and the Queen with him, and 
he came forward and knelt at Bernard's feet, with 
bent head and folded hands. The great abbot took 
pieces of scarlet cloth from a page who held them
