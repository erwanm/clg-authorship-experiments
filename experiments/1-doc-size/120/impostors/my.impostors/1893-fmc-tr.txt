pointing with his hand, which trembled a little. “It’s open--just get
what there is and bring it here, will you?”

Katharine rose.

“I don’t want any money, if you mean to give it to me,” she said, as she
crossed the room.

She brought him a roll of bills.

“Count it,” he said.

She counted carefully, turning back the crisp green notes over her
delicate fingers. It was new money.

“There are three hundred and fifty dollars,” she said. “At least, I
think I’ve counted right.”

“Near enough. Make a note of it, my dear. There are pencil and paper on
the table. There--just write down the figure. Now put the money into
your pocket, and go and spend it on some trifle.”

“I’d rather not,” answered Katharine, hesitating.

She had never had so much money in her hand in her whole life, though
she was the grand-niece of Robert the Rich.

“Do as I tell you!” cried the old man, almost fiercely, and in a much
stronger voice than he had been able to find hitherto.

Katharine obeyed, seeing that he was really losing his temper.

“You may as well spend it on toys as leave it to the servants,” he said.
“They’d have stolen it as soon as I was dead. Not that I mean to die,
though. Not till I’ve settled one or two things like this. I feel
stronger.”

“I’m so glad!” exclaimed Katharine.

“So am I,” growled the sick man. “You’ve saved my life.”

“I?”

“Yes, child. Go and tell Routh that I said so. Upon my word!” he
grumbled, half audibly. “Selling her poor little miniatures to buy
clothes for herself and her children--my nieces--that’s just a little
too much, you know--can’t see how I could die decently--well--without
telling him what I think about it. Katharine,” he said, more loudly,
addressing her, “it amounts to this. I’ve left a few charities, and I’ve
left the Miners a little something to make them comfortable, and I’ve
given a million to the Brights--Hamilton and Hester and their
mother--and I’ve left the rest to you three young ones--you and
Charlotte and Jack Ralston. That ought to make about twenty-five
millions for each of you. I want to know if you think I’ve done right?”

Katharine’s hands dropped by her side. For the first time in her life
she was literally struck dumb.

“That doesn’t mean,” continued the old man, watching her keenly, as the
light came back to his eyes, “that doesn’t mean that I give you all that
money, just as I gave you that roll of bills just now. It’s all tied up
in trusts, just as far as the law would allow me to do it. You couldn’t
take it and throw it into the street, nor speculate, nor buy a railway,
nor do anything of the kind. You and Charlotte will have to pay half
your income to your father and mother while they live, and you’ll have
to leave it to your children--at least, Charlotte must, and I hope you
will, my dear. And Jack must give half of his income to his mother. You
see, as there are three parents, that will make it exactly equal. And
all three of you have to pay something to make up an income for your
grandfather. So it will still be equally shared. I like you best, my
dear, but I couldn’t show any favouritism in my will. The end of it will
be that you will each have something less than half the income of
twenty-five millions to spend. That’s better than selling miniatures to
buy clothes, anyway. Isn’t it, now?”

He laughed hoarsely and then coughed.

“Go home, child,” he said, presently. “I’ve talked too much. Stop,
though. What I’ve told you is not to be repeated on any account. I
wanted to know what you thought of the right and wrong of the thing--but
I’ve taken your breath away. Go home and think about it. Come and see me
day after to-morrow--there, I shouldn’t have said that an hour ago--give
me a little of that beef tea, please, my dear. I’m hungry--and I’d
rather have it from your hand than from Mrs. Deems’s. Thank you.”

He drank eagerly, and she took the cup from him and set it down again.

“She’s a good creature, the nurse,” he said. “A very good creature--a
sort of holy scarecrow. I shan’t need her much longer.”

“You really do seem better,” said Katharine, wondering how she could
ever have believed that he was dying.

“I’m going to get well this time. I told Routh this morning that I
wasn’t going to die. You’ve saved my life. There’s nothing like rage for
the action of the heart, I believe. I shall be out next week.”

He began to cough again.

“Go home--go home,” he managed to say, between the short spasms. “I’m
talking too much.”

Katharine bent down and kissed his forehead quickly, looked at him
affectionately and left the room, for she saw that what he said was
true. She closed the door softly and found her way to the stairs. She
was in haste to get out into the air and to be alone, for she wished, if
possible, to realize the stupendous possibilities of life which the last
few minutes had brought into her range of mental vision. It was not a
light thing to have been told that she was one day to be among the
richest of her very rich acquaintances, after having been brought up in
such a penurious fashion.

In the hall she came suddenly upon her father and mother, who were
parleying with the butler.

“Here’s Miss Katharine, sir,” said the servant, and he immediately fell
back, glad to avoid further discussion with such a very obstinate person
as Alexander Junior.

“Why, Katharine!” exclaimed Mrs. Lauderdale, in surprise. “Do you mean
