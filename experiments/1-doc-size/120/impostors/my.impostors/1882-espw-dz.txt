Yorke : " Would you oblige me by saying bow 
near I am to the town of Sherman ? " 
Native, interrogatively : " Sherman ? " 

Yorke, decidedly : " Yes ; Sherman." 

Native, reflectively : " Sherm-an." 

A pause. 

"Travelin fur?" 

" From Bangor to Sherman." 

" Oh ! " 

" I fear I have got out of my way. I hope you 
can direct me." 

" Wall. You said Sherman ? " 

Yorke,, emphatically : " I certainly did ! " 

Native, cheerfully : " Wall. If it 's Sherman 
you're goin fur, I sh 'd ventur it might be a 
matter of eight mile to Sherman. Hancock 's 
nigher. So 's Cherrytowii." 

Yorke, explosively :" But I do not wish to visit 
Hancock or Cherrytown ! " 

" Oh, you don't. Wall." 

Native 's wife, coming to the door, and standing 
with heavy hand raised, gaunt forefinger stretch 
ing down the road: "That 's the way to Sher 
man : down that there gully, and take your second 
left and your fust right, and then roller the wind. 
But it ain't no eight mile." 

Yorke, lost in thinking how much she looks 

like a Maine sign-post : " Thank you, madam. 
How far do you call it to Sherman ? " 

" It ain't a peg over six, Sherman ain't." 

Native 's boy, pushing between his parents, and 
appearing vivaciously in the foreground : " It 's 
three mile n a half, mister ! And you don't take 
your second left. You jest f oiler your nose, an 
you 'll make it. Folks hain't been thar sence the 
old hoss died. I went one winter. I belong to 
the Sherman Brass Band." 

"It 's true," said the woman, apologetically, 
" me and Mr. Bailey don't get to Sherman very 
often. But Bob, he don't know a mile from a 
close-pin." 

A prolonged pause. 

" Is there a hotel in this this metropolis ? " 
asked Yorke, looking vaguely about the beautiful 
wilderness. 

" Sir ? " 

" Is there a tavern in this village? " 

" No, sir." 

"Do you ever accommodate hungry travelers 
with a dinner in your own family ? " 

" Wall, no ; we never hev. They mostly go to 
Nahum Smithses." 

" Can I get anything to eat, in this desert, of 
Mr. Smith or any other citizen of your acquaintance ? " 



 

" Wall, mebbe you might. Might ask. Nahum 
Smith is a gentleman as puts up." 

Yorke, reviving : "A gentleman that puts up ? 
That sounds hopeful. How far is it to this
gentleman 's ? " 

Native : " Two miles. 

Native 's wife : " It 's two n a quarter." 

Native 's boy, disrespectfully and musically : 
" I ain't a mi-i-ile ! " 

Yorke turned away with such gratitude towards 
this enlightened family as he could muster into 
expression, and set offt grimly in search of the 
gentleman that put up. 

The woman ran after him for some distance 
through the dusty, blazing? blinding noon. He 
reined up, and she called kindly, gesticulating 
with her lean arms, " If you come acrost a woman 
ridin in a little frisky wagin with an amberel 
atop, just you ask her. She 'll know ! " 

It was one of those coincidences which make, 
according to one 's temperament, either the poetry 
or the superstition of life, that young Yorke, in 
the course of twenty minutes savage and unsuc 
cessful pursuit of the gentleman that put up, com 
ing sharply to the top of a glaring hill, saw at the 
foot of it, dimly through the dust, a sight as for 
eign to the Maine wilderness as a sleigh to Florida
