bles : ' Five teeth — one a-coming — 
Catholic — yarn — cotton — kip — thinking 
damn that kip Then he straight-

and ploughs his hands through his 
hair — ploughs and ploughs, mutter- 
ing, ' Damn that kip ! ' Then he stands 
up and frowns, and begins to tally 
off his clews on his fingers — and gets 
stuck at the ring-finger. But only 
just a minute — then his face glares 
all up in a smile like a house afire, 
and he straightens up stately and 
majestic, and says to the crowd, ' Take 
a lantern, a couple of you, and go 
down to Injun Billy's and fetch the 
child — the rest of you go 'long home

Matterhorn, and pulls out for the 
Edsy style tavern. That's his style,

all over in fifteen minutes — no poking around 

all over the sage-brush range an hour 

and a half in a mass-meeting crowd

''By Jackson, it's grand!" said 

Ham Sandwich. '' Wells-Fargo, you've 

got him down to a dot. He ain't 

painted up any exacter to the life in 

the books. By George, I can just see 

him -can't you, boys?" 

''You bet you! It's just a photo-made  graft, 
that's what it is." 
Ferguson was profoundly pleased 
with his success, and grateful. He 
sat silently enjoying his happiness a 
little while, then he murmured, with 
a deep awe in his voice. 

" I wonder if God made him?" 

There was no response for a moment; 
then Ham Sandwich said, reverently, 

''Not all at one time, I reckon." 

IT eight o'clock that even- 
ing two persons were 
groping their way past 
Flint Buckner's cabin in 
the frosty gloom. They were Sher- 
lock Holmes and his nephew. 

"Stop here in the road a moment, 
iincle' said Fetlock, "while I run 
to my cabin; I won't be gone a 
minute.'' 

He asked for something — the uncle 
furnished it — then he disappeared in 
the darkness, but soon returned, and 
the talking-walk was resumed. By 

nine o'clock they had wandered back  

to the tavern. They worked their 

way through the billiard-room, where 

a crowd had gathered in the hope of 

getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary 

Man. A royal cheer was raised. Mr. 

Holmes acknowledged the compliment 

with a series of courtly bows, and as 

he was passing out his nephew said 

to the assemblage, 

"Uncle Sherlock's got some work 
to do, gentlemen, that'll keep him 
till twelve or one, but he'll be down 
again then, or earlier if he can, and 
hopes some of you'll be left to take a 
drink with him." 

"By George, he's just a duke, 
boys! Three cheers for Sherlock 
Holmes, the greatest man that ever 
lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, 

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" 
To treat The Uproar shook the building, 
so hearty was the feeling the boys 
put into their welcome. Upstairs the 
uncle reproached the nephew gently, 
saying, 

"What did you get me into that 
engagement for?" 

" I reckon you don't want to be un- 
popular, do you, uncle? Well, then, 
don't you put on any exclusiveness 
in a mining-camp, that's all. The
