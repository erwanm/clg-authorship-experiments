of sounds outside, the door flew open, 
and an excited crowd burst in, with 
the camp's one white woman in the 
lead and crying: 

"My child! my child! she's lost 
l  and gone! For the love of God help 
'" me to find Archy Stillman; weVe 

himted everywhere!" 

Said the barkeeper: 

''Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, 
and don't worry. He asked for a 
bed three hours ago, tuckered out 
tramping the trails the way he's al- 
ways doing, and went up stairs. Ham 
Sandwich, run up and roust him out; 
he's in No. 14." 

The youth was soon downstairs 
and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan 
for particulars. 

''Bless you, dear, there ain't any; 


I wish there was. I put her to sleep 
at seven in the evening, and when I 
went in there an hour ago to go to bed
myself, she was gone. I rushed for 

your cabin, dear, and you wasn't 
there, and Tve hunted for you ever 
since, at every cabin down the gulch, 
and now Tve come up again, and 
Fm that distracted and scared and 
heart-broke; but, thanks to God, Tve 
found you at last, dear heart, and 
you'll find my child. Come on I come 
quick !'' 

"Move right along; Fm with you, 
madam. Go to your cabin first." 

The whole company streamed out 
to join the hunt. All the southern 
half of the village was up, a hundred 
men strong, and waiting outside, a 
vague dark mass sprinkled with twin- 
kling lanterns. The mass fell into 
columns by threes and fours to ac- 
commodate itself to the narrow road, 
and strode briskly along southward 
in the wake of the leaders. In a 
few minutes the Hogan cabin was 
reached. 

"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Ho- 
gan; "there's where she was; it's 
where I laid her at seven o'clock; but 
where she is now, God only knows." 

" Hand me a lantern," said Archy. 
He set it on the hard earth floor 
and knelt by it, pretending to exam- 
ine the ground closely. "Here's her 
track," he said, touching the ground 
here and there and yonder with his 
finger. " Do you see?" 


Several of the company dropped 
upon their knees and did their best 
to see. One or two thought they 
discerned something hke a track; 
the others shook their heads and con- 
fessed that the smooth hard surface 
had no marks upon it which their 
eyes were sharp enough to discover. 
One said, " Maybe a child's foot could 
make a mark on it, but I don't see 
how." 

Young Stillman stepped outside, 
held the light to the ground, turned 
leftward, and moved along three steps. 



On the trail closely examining; then said,
"I've got the direction — come along; take 
the lantern, somebody." 
He strode off swiftly southward. 
The files following, swaying and bending 
in and out with the deep curves 
of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the 
mouth of the gorge was reached; 
before them stretched the sage-brush 
Following an plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman 
called a halt, saying, "We mustn't 
start wrong, now; we must take the 
direction again.'' He took a lantern 
and examined the ground for a matter 
of twenty yards; then said, "Come 
on; it's all right," and gave up the 
lantern. In and out among the sage- 
bushes he marched, a quarter of a 
mile, bearing gradually to the right; 
then took a new direction and made 
another great semicircle; then changed 
again and moved due west nearly 
half a mile — and stopped. 
"She gave it up, here, poor little 
chap. Hold the lantern. You can 
see where she sat' 

But this was in a slick alkali flat 
which was surfaced like steel, and no
