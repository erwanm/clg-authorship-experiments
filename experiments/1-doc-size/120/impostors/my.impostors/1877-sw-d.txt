out tired and dirty ; and Sunday, as I told you, they like 
to stay at home and rest and perhaps clean up.' 

' If there is no help for that,' said Diana, ' there ought 
to be no mills.' 

' And no manufacturers ? ' 

' What are silk and iron, to the bodies and souls of 
men ? Basil, does that passage in the Revelation mean 
that ? ' 

' What passage ? ' said Mr. Brandt. ' Here is a Bible, 
Mrs. Masters ; perhaps you will be so good as to find the 
place. I am afraid from your expression, it is not a flattering passage for us mill-owners. What are the words you 
refer to ? ' 

I think he wanted to draw out Diana much more than 
the meaning of Scripture. She took the Bible a little 
doubtfully and glanced at Basil. He was smiling at her 
in a reassuring way, but did not at all offer to help. Diana's thoughts wandered somewhat and she turned the 
leaves of the Bible unsuccessfully. ' Where is it, Basil ? ' 

' You are thinking of the account of the destruction of 
Babylon. It is in the eighteenth chapter.' 

' But Babylon ! ' said the host. ' We have nothing to 
do with Babylon. That means Rome, doesn't it ? ' 

' Here's the chapter,' said Diana. ' No, it cannot mean 
Rome, Mr. Brandt ; though Dean Stanley seems to assume 
that it does, in spite of the fact which he naively points 
out, that the description don't fit.' 

'What then?' 

' Basil, won't you explain ? ' 

' It is merely an assumption of old Testament imagery,' 
said Basil. 'At a time when lineal Israel stood for the 
church of God upon earth, Babylon represented the head 
and culmination of the world power, the church's deadly 
opponent and foe. Babylon in the Apocalypse but means 
that of which Nebuchadnezzar's old Babylon was the type.' 

' And what is that ? ' 

' The power of this world, of which Satan is said to be 
the prince.' 

' But what do you mean by the world, Mr. Masters ? 
We cannot get out of the world it is a pretty good world 
too, I think, take it for all in all. People talk of being 
worldly and not worldly ; but they do not know what they 
are talking about.' 

' Why not ? ' Diana asked. 


 

' Well now, ask my wife,' Mr. Brandt answered laughing. 
' She thinks it is " worldly " to have a cockade on your 
coachman's hat ; it is not worldly to have the coachman, or 
the carriage, and she don't object to a coat with buttons. 
Then it is not worldly to give a party, but it is worldly to 
dance ; it is very worldly to play cards. There's hair-splitting somewhere, and my eyes are not sharp enough to see 
the lines.' 

Diana sat with her book in her hand, looking up at the 
speaker ; a look so fair and clear and grave that Mr. Brandt 
was again moved by curiosity and tempted to try to make 
her speak. 

' Can you make it out ? ' he said smiling. 

' Why yes ! ' said Diana ; ' but there is no hair-splitting. 
It is very simple. There are just two kingdoms in the 
world, Mr. Brandt; and whatever does not belong to the 
one, belongs to the other. Whatever is not for God, is for 
the world.' 

' Then your definition of the "world " is ? ' 

' All that is not God's.' 

' But I am not clear yet. I don't see how you draw 
the line. Take my mills, for example ; they belong to this 
profane, work-a-day world ; yet I must run them. Is that 
worldly ? ' 

' Yes, if you do not run them for God.' 

Mr. Brandt stared a little. 

' I confess, I do not see how that is to be done,' he 
owned. 

'The business that you cannot do for God, you had 
better not do at all,' said Diana gently. 

' But spinning cotton ? ' 

' Spinning cotton, or anything else that employs men 
and makes money.' 



 

'How?' 

' You can do it for God, cannot you ? ' said Diana in 
the same way. ' You can employ the men and make the 
money for his sake, and in his service.' 

'But that is coming pretty close,' said the mill-owner. 
' Suppose I want a little of the money for myself and my 
family ? '
