gathered from their chatter that they had been stay 
ing with this Miss Thurston, so she imagined it was 
a delightful old country-house where boarders were 
taken in the summer ; and she fancied Miss Thurston 
one of those fascinating women of about forty, who 
always attract young people to them. Think of 
that ! " and Eve laughs merrily. " But, you know, 



she only heard snatches, and not a coherent conver 
sation. It lingered in her mind, and she resolved to 
hunt me up. She has orders for two landscapes, 
' Autumns', one about a month later than the other, 
and one with a river. So she came over to-day, and 
found me, and actually said ' My dear child ' to me. 
That was simply delicious," and Eve laughs again. 
"Well, the end of this marvellous and improbable 
story is, that we like each other, and she is coming 
over one day next week, and we will drive around 



 

to hunt up cosey nooks. How I shall tease the 
girls ! " 

I was silent, revolving Miss Hildreth's strange 
entrance into our world. 

" She was very nice," continued Eve. " She gave 
me some references in a quiet business way, as if she 
was not afraid. She boards with a cousin of her 
mother, a charming elderly person whose description 
suggested Mrs. Harwood to my mind. And I must 
say I like her, although I do know there are frauds 
and adventurers in the world." 

" She is no fraud ! " I declared indignantly. 

" Then, she impressed you favorably. I am glad of 
that, for you ought to be wiser than I, Adam. Still, 
we will why, we will trust her, unless she tells 
some awful story, or does something very naughty. 
Now we must both go to bed and dream about her. 
Would it not be funny if she never came again ? " 

We both laughed heartily at that. 

I do not think I dreamed of Miss Hildreth, but 
I thought of her a long while before I fell asleep. I 
could see her large, clear eyes through the dusk, and 
the very atmosphere seemed touched and penetrated 
with her voice. 

We talked of it the next day, and somehow it 
had a very incredible air. 

But we were busy enough planning and consider- 



 

ing. There was fruit to can and preserve. We 
would have more pears than we could use, and more 
peaches ; but we found ready customers in the Wil 
burs. Joe was laying out their garden, and had 
reduced their blackberries to order. My currant- 
slips had rooted nicely, so we gave them a row of 
currants, and, later, were to transplant some of our 
over-abundant shrubbery. Mr. Randall came down 
to ask my advice. The neighbors about us seemed 
to think we had such a wonderful garden. How did 
I do it, one and another inquired ; and even Mr. 
Montgomery ceased to sneer at book-learning and 
experiments. 

Miss Hildreth sent a card, specifying the day of 
her visit. The weather was still warm; but there 
had been a little rain the evening before, and the 
roads were in an excellent condition. I found 
myself watching eagerly for her train. The acquaint 
ance had a flavor of the unusual in it, a touch akin 
to the occult. That she should have hunted up 
Eve and Athens just because the names had taken 
her fancy ! 

We found her quite as charming as on her first 
call. I say we. I escorted her up to the pretty house, 
where some late wistaria and Chinese honeysuckle 
were in bloom, and no end of sal via and foliage- 
plants. Somehow, every thing had grown so abun- 



 

dantly with us. I could hardly convince myself 
that it was the neglected old Cassel place. 

" How beautiful it is ! " Miss Hildreth said, paus 
ing. " Mr. Thurston, you should be a gardener or 
florist. You have the divine inspiration." 

" I think much of the credit due my sister," I 
answered. " She has the exquisite ideas." 

" If I were not an artist, I should want to be 
a florist. The height of my ambition is to own a 
greenhouse." 

I smiled. Eve came out to welcome her friend. 
Joe had the carriage ready. They were to go in the 
morning, as Joe had an engagement to drive two old 
ladies out at two o'clock. 

They had, it seems, a delightful time, and were 
hungry enough when they reached home, allowing
