Isle of Bourbon whose port we entered two days after.

With the cold climate that we exchanged for a warmer as we again
approached the equator, we lost sight of the countless flocks of
sea-birds that so long had accompanied us. It is something remarkable
that they only inhabit the colder latitudes, for in a warmer climate
it is a rare thing to find them. Sometimes a few weary land-birds that
have strayed from their homeward way, skim over the ocean, or rest
upon the masts; how they maintain themselves on the wing cannot be
conjectured, but certain it is, they have been seen on the trackless
ocean, when no point of land was within hundreds of miles.

On the first day of December, a long range of blue hills rose on the
far horizon as if springing from the sea; we soon found it to be the
coast of Sumatra. Contrary winds kept us beating about and prevented
our entering the straits of Sunda, but we found ourselves surrounded
by a number of ships from all nations sharing a like fate, and waiting
with the same impatience for a favoring wind to blow them into Sunda
Roads or to their different destinations. At last the wished for
breeze sprung up, the sails swelled, and our gallant ship sailed
proudly through the straits. On all sides were seen chains of blue
hills and richly wooded islands rising out of the water; the long
coast of Java and Sumatra covered with vegetation and groups of
beautiful trees, and the thousand little green islets that studded the
straits like emeralds cast at random, presented a lively picture that
contrasted pleasantly with the late monotony we had endured. Huge
trunks of pistangs and tops of cocoanut trees, broken off by the wind
were driven about in all directions, and as they met us, awakened
almost as much apprehension as would a reef of rocks. We passed many
islands uninhabited, and with their impervious forests still remaining
in primitive wildness, clothed in the beauty of a perpetual verdure
unknown in northern regions, and soon came in sight of the white
houses of the island of Java, which surrounded with lofty trees and
blooming gardens, proclaimed themselves the dwellings of Europeans.
From many eminences the Dutch flag was seen floating, and as we sailed
along, a Java village looked out from among the tall cocoanut trees;
little barks shot out from the shore and steered towards our ship, and
one European boat manned with eight Javanese rowers, and bearing the
flag of Holland at her stern reached us first.

A police officer, corpulent and full of importance, now came on board
and handed the captain a sheet of paper on which he was desired to
inscribe the name and destination of the vessel, from what port she
had sailed, what burthen she carried, and other notices of the same
kind.

This finished, the Javanese barks rowed swiftly along side; these
small crafts are generally made of the trunk of a tree, neatly
hollowed out; they are filled with fruit, fowls, eggs, apes, parrots,
shells, and such like wares, with which the owner drives a profitable
trade with the ships. He sits on a little bench in the midst of his
merchandize with a short, broad oar in either hand; with this he
propels his fragile vessel; which is often not more than an inch or
two above the water's edge. After we had exchanged our pure Spanish
piastres, which is the coin they most prefer, for such things as we
needed, the traffic with the sailors commenced.

Such old jackets, woolen shirts, caps and whatever other articles of
clothing they could spare were bartered for eggs, cocoanuts, pine
apples and other eatables. This accounts for the singular garb of the
Javanese boatmen,--striped shirts, woolen caps and duck trowsers are
strangely mingled with portions of the oriental dress, and a sailor's
jacket with large brass buttons is considered quite ornamental. Next
to clothing they prefer knives, scissors and articles of iron ware. In
general the Javanese are pretty good judges of the value of these
articles, and mostly contrive to make a more profitable traffic from
their fruit and poultry than the European sailor with his stock of old
clothes. In the evening it is often the case at this time of year that
constant lightnings play round the horizon, illumining the picturesque
shores of Java and Sumatra. Impenetrable darkness shrouds both earth
and sea, and only by the light of the electric flash is the mariner
shown how to keep off land, and with shortened sail holds on his way.
On board of all vessels, on binnacle, masts and spars are hung lighted
lanterns in order to avoid collision with each other, for in the thick
darkness that envelopes all around, no object can be discerned at a
distance of three yards. In the meantime the wind pipes shrilly
through the shrouds, and lashes the waves into foam white as
snow-wreaths. After a few hours all again is still, no breeze disturbs
the ocean, the sails flap lazily against the mast, the waves subside
to a glassy smoothness, and the rain gradually ceases as the dawn
approaches. So pass the nights in this climate during the rainy
season.

In the morning we found ourselves surrounded with a great number of
vessels, the white sails of European ships covered the sea on all
sides, contrasting strongly with the small coasters made of plaited
hemp that darted gaily over the blue waves, and fishing boats of all
sorts and sizes were crossing our path or following in our wake. We
were seemingly enclosed in a nest of small islands, and it was a
mystery to conceive how it would be possible to find our way out of
such a labyrinth. Only by the high volcanic hills, with their crowns
of light smoke were we able to recognize the mainland of Java, whilst
the flowery coast of Sumatra faded gradually from our view, until at
length it was lost on the distant horizon. But the experienced eye of
our captain discerned clearly the way that lay before us; for many
years he had guided his ship in safety through these dangerous seas,
and attentive to his duty and his chart, he disentangled her from
among this knot of islands and we found ourselves once more in a free
offing. Soon the Roads of Batavia were in sight, where more than fifty
large ships and an incredible number of smaller ones were lying at
anchor. The French, Dutch, Austrian and English flags greeted our
arrival, one ship after another welcomed us to the roads with their
thundering cannon, which was regularly answered by the guard ship
constantly stationed here. At last our anchor was let down and fell
rattling into the deep. But, different from Sumatra and the coast of
Java we had left, nothing was to be seen at Batavia but a flat, low
beach overgrown with bushes, behind which appeared some groups of
green trees, and in the far distance rose a chain of blue hills from
the summits of which clouds of smoke were issuing, that told of the
many volcanic fires that are constantly burning in the Island of
Java.
