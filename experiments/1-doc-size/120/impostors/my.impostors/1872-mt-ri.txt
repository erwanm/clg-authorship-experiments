rank than any other member of society. His opinion had 
weight. It was his privilege to say how the elections should 
go. No great movement could succeed without the counte- 
nance and direction of the saloon-keepers. It was a high favor 
when the chief saloon-keeper consented to serve in the legislature 
or the board of aldermen. Youthful ambition hardly 

aspired so much to the honors of the law, or the army and 
navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon. 

To be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious. 
Hence the reader will not be surprised to learn that more 
than one man was killed in Kevada under hardly the pretext 
of provocation, so impatient was the slayer to achieve reputa- 
tion and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent 
repute by his associates. I knew two youths who tried to 
" kill their men " for no other reason — and got killed them- 
pelves for their pains. " There goes the man that killed Bill 
Adams " was higher praise and a sweeter sonnd in the ears of 
this sort of people than any other speech that admiring lips 
could utter. 

The men who murdered Virginia's original twenty-six 
cemetery -occupants M-ere never punished. Why ? Because 
Alfred the Great, when he invented trial by jury, and knew 
that he had admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of 
the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century the 
condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless 
he rose from the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the 
emergency, it would ]U'ove the most ingenious and infallible 
agency for defeating justice that human wisdom could con- 
trive. For how could he imagine that we simpletons would 
go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it 
of its usefulness, any more than he could imagine that we 
would go on using his candle-clock after we had invented 
chronometers? In his day news could not travel fast, and 
hence he could easily find a jury of honest, intelligent men 
who had not heard of the case they were called to try — but in 
our day of telegraphs and newsjapers his plan compels us to 
swear in juries composed of fools and rascals, because the 
system rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains. 

I remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, 
which we call a jury trial. A noted desperado killed Mr. B., 
a good citizen, in the most wanton and cold-blooded way. 
Of course the papers were full of it, and all men capable of 
reading, read about it. And of course all men not deaf and 
dumb and idiotic, talked about it. A jury-list was made out, 
and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was 
questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any 
court in America : 

" Have you heard of this homicide ? " 

" Yes." 

" Have you held conversations upon the subject ? " 


"Yes." 

" Have you formed or expressed opinions about it ? " 

"Yes."" 

"Have you read the newspaper accounts of it? " 

"Yes." 

"We do not want you." 

A minister, intelligent, esteemed, and greatly respected; 
& merchant of high character and known probity ; a mining 
superintendent of intelligence and unblemished reputation ; a 
quartz mill owner of excellent standing, were all questioned in 
the same way, and all set aside. Each said the public talk and 
the newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that 
sworn testimony would overthrow his previously formed opin- 
ions and enable him to render a verdict without prejudice and 
in accordance with the facts. But of course such men could 
not be trusted with the case. Ignoramuses alone could mete 
out unsullied justice. 

When the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury 
of twelve men was impaneled — a jury who swore they had 
neither heard, read, talked about nor expressed an opinion 
concerning a murder which the very cattle in the corrals, the 
Indians in the saoje-brush and the stones in the streets were 

cognizant of! It was a jury composed of two desperadoes, 
two low beer-house politicians, three bar-keepers, two ranchmen 
who could not read, and three dull, stupid, human donkeys ! 

It actually came out afterward, that one of these latter thought 
that incest and arson were the same thing. 

The verdict rendered by this jury was, IS'ot Guilty. What 
else could one expect ? 

The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty, 
and a premium upon ignorance, stupidity and perjury. It is 
a shame that we must continue to use a worthless systejn be- 
cause it was good a thousand years ago. In this age, when a 
gentleman of high social standing, intelligence and probity, 
swears that testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh, 
with him, street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere 
hearsay, he is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to 
their own ignorance and stupidity, and justice would be far 
safer m his hands than in theirs. Why could not the jury law 
be so altered as to give men of brains and honesty an eqtial 
chance with fools and miscreants? Is it right to show the 
present favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability 
on another, in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are 
free and equal ? I am a candidate for the legislature. I de- 
sire to tamper with the jury law. I wish to so alter it as to 
put a premium on intelligence and character, and close the 
jury box against idiots, blacklegs, and people who do not read 
newspapers. But no doubt I shall be defeated — every effort 
I make to save the country " misses fire."
