Within two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and 
a couple of children, entered. 

" Come right along, friends," said Col. Jack ; " don't mind 
us. This is a free blow-out." Then he whispered to Col. 
Jim, " lew York ain't no sociable place, I don't reckon — it 
ain't no nmne for it !" 

He resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and 

made everybody cordially welcome. The situation 
dawned on the people, and 
they pocketed their money, and delivered tliemselves 
up to covert enjoyment of the episode. Half a dozen 
more passengers entered. 

" Oh, there's plenty 
of room," said Col. Jack. 
" Walk right in, and make 
yourselves at home, A 
blow-out ain't worth anything as a blow-out, unless 
a body has company." Then in a whisper to Col. Jim : " But 
ain't these New Yorkers friendly ? And ain't they cool about 
it, too? Icebergs ain't anywhere. I reckon they'd tackle a 
hearse, if it was going their way." 

More passengers got in ; more yet, and still more. Both 
seats were filled, and a file of men were standing up, holding 
on to the cleats overhead. Parties with baskets and bundles 
were climbing up on the roof. Half-suppressed laughter rippled
up from all sides. 

" Well, for clean, cool, oiit-and-oiit clieek, if tins don't bang 
anything that ever I saw, I'm an Injun ! " whispered Col. 
Jack. 

A Chinaman crowded his way in. 

" I weaken ! " said Col. Jack. " Hold on, driver ! Keep 
your seats, ladies and gents. Just make yourselves free — 
everything's paid for. Driver, rustle these folks around as 
long as they're a mind to go — friends of ours, you know. 
Take them everywheres — and if you want more money, come 

to the St. Nicholas, and we'll make it all right. Pleasant 
journey to you, ladies and gents — go it just as long as you 
please — it shan't cost you a cent ! " 

The two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said : 
" Jimmy, it's the sociablest place I ever saw. The China- 
man waltzed in as comfortable as anybody. If we'd staid 
awhile, I reckon we'd had some niggers. B' George, we'll 
have to barricade our doors to-night, or some of these ducks 
"will be trying to sleep with us." 



CHAPTER XLYII. 

SOMEBODY has said that in order to know a community, 
one must observe the style of its funerals and know 
what manner of men they bury with most ceremony. I can- 
not say which class we buried with most eclat in our " flush 
times," the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished 
rougli — possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of 
society honored their illustrious dead about equally ; and 
hence, no doubt the philosopher I have quoted from would 
have needed to see two representative funerals in Yirginia 
before forming his estimate of the people. 

There was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died. 
He was a representative citizen. He had "killed his man" — 
not in his own quarrel, it is true, but in defence of a stranger 
unfairly beset by numbers. He had kept a sumptuous saloon. 
He had been the proprietor of a dashing helpmeet whom he 
could have discarded without the formality of a divorce. He 
had held a high position in the fire department and been a 
very Warwick in politics. When he died there was great 
lamentation throughout the town, but especially in the vast 
bottom-stratum of society. 

On the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the 
delirium of a wasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot 
himself through the body, cut his throat, ;Tud jumped out of a 
four-story window and broken his neck — and after due delib- 
eration, the jury, sad and tearful, but with intelligence un- 
blinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death "by the 
visitation of God." What could the world do without juries I 

Prodigious preparations were made for the funeral. All 
the vehicles in town were hired, all the saloons put in momT> 

ing, all the municipal and fire-company flags Imng at half-mast, 
and all the firemen ordered to muster in uniform and bring 
their machines duly draped in black, low — let us remark in 
parenthesis — as all the peoples of the earth had representative 
adventurers in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had 
brought the slang of his nation or his locality with him, the 
combination made the slang of Nevada the richest and the 
most infinitely varied and copious that had ever existed any- 
where in the world, perhaps, except in the mines of California 
in the " early days." Slang was the language of Nevada. It 
was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be understood. 
Such plirases as " You bet ! " " Oh, no, I reckon not ! " " No 
Irish need apply," and a hundred others, became so common 
as to fall from the lips of a speaker unconsciously — and very 
often when they did not touch the subject under discussion 
and consequently failed to mean anything. 

After Buck Fanshaw's inquest, a meeting of the short- 
haired brotherhood was held, for nothing can be done on the 
Pacific coast without a public meeting and an expression of 
sentiment. Regretful resolutions were passed and various 
committees appointed ; among others, a committee of one was 
deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle ,spirituel new 
fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet un- 
acquainted with the ways of the mines. The conmiitteeman, 
" Scotty " Briggs, made his visit ; and in after days it was 
worth something to hear the minister tell about it. Scotty 
was a stalwart rough, whose customary suit, when on weighty
