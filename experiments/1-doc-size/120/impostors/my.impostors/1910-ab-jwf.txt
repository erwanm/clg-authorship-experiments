made her a ceremonious bow, indicating the little chair at his 
right hand. 

" Sit there, maidie," he said. 

Whereupon Tonty dropped a curtsey with her foot prettily 
behind her, and took it« They had both found it was highly 
difficult to settle the others in their places unless Winterbourne 
was also in his. This insurrectionary surplus seemed to feel 
that the base of operations might easily change, whereas the 
quieting eflfect of a stationary story-teller was evident. 

" Once upon a time — " said Winterbourne. Then he put 
out his hand for Tonty's and she gave him hers. " Once upon 
a time there was a frightful ogre. And he had a wife who 
wasn't an ogress. She was a lady and very beautiful. And 
she came to him one day and said ' Ogre, here I am, and 



 





here are two daughters, who are ladies and very beautiful. 
What are you going to do with us ? ' " 

He ceased, and Tonty, glancing up at him remindingly, 
saw that he was looking into the fire, not as he often did, in 
high pleasure as if he expected to find a million things there 
to make his story better, but as if he had hurt himself or 
somebody and felt very sad indeed. That was what Tonty 
never could bear. 

" Oh, dear!" she said under her breath. 

Tiny, who, though a ridiculous mite, had the greatest un- 
derstanding among them all of the naughty possibilities of 
life, inquired ruthlessly, — 

"Did he like his wife?" 

" No," said Winterbourne hopelessly, as if out of a dream 
where it would do no harm to tell the truth. " I don't be- 
lieve he liked her. Oh, I don't know whether he did or not I 
He never could tell." 

" Well," said Tiny, putting her little worn shoes nearer 
the blaze, "if he didn't like his wife and didn't like his 
daughters, he'd kill 'em, wouldn't he? Tell now how he 
killed 'em." 

Winterbourne started out of his reverie. 

"I didn't say he killed 'em, did I ? Did I say that?" 

He turned from one to another of the pointed faces, and 
when he got to Tonty, he sighed in gratitude. She was look- 
ing at him with soft eyes and shaking her head. 

" No," he said, " of course he didn't kill 'em. I don't 
know, though. Maybe he killed the daughters. He wouldn't 
kill his wife. She 'd suffered enough already." 

"What's suffered?" inquired Tiny, with some difficulty 
over the word. 

But Winterbourne did not, according to his patient wont, 
pause to answer. 



 





" We could kill the daughters, though," he said hopefully. 
" There 'd be two of them out of the way. No, by George ! 
we couldn't kill 'em both. One of 'em 's got to live. She's 
suffered enough, too. Well, the ogre did kill one of his 
daughters." 

Tiny pulled her feet back from the blaze, put her hands 
between her knees, and drew her breath sharply with relish. 

"How ? " she said. " How 'd he kill her ? Make it long." 

" The ogre took a sack and filled it with barley-meal. And 
then he called his daughter and said to her, ' Put this barley- 
meal together until you have grains of barley. And put the 
grains of barley together until you have heads of barley. And 
set the barley growing in the field, and set the birds to sing- 
ing over it — ' " 

" What kind of birds ? " Tony inquired. He was a sports- 
man and owned a pea-shooter. 

" Blackbirds and swallows and bluebirds and robins, those 
four kinds. ' And if you can't do that,' says the ogre, ' you 
will be killed and eaten up.' " 

Tonty had drawn her hand away from the large one hold- 
ing it. He thought uneasily that it was done in a mute re- 
proach. Now she spoke quite firmly • 

" I could finish it, Jackie." 

" No ! no ! no !" voted the chorusing voices. 

But Winterbourne was attending to her very carefully. 

"Yes, I guess you 'd better finish it, maidie," he said. "I 
don't know the end." 

" So," said maidie, her eyes upon the fire as she knew a 
real story-teller's were, because, as Winterbourne had once
