and courts, that I think nobody can describe or under- 
stand, built at different times and in imitation of many 
styles. The front, toward the Hof Garden, a grassless 
square of small trees, with open arcades on two sides for 
shops, and partially decorated with frescos of land- 
scapes and historical subjects, is " a building of festive 
halls," a facade eight hundred feet long, in the revived 
Italian style, and with a fine Ionic porch. The color is

the royal, dirty yellow. On the Max Joseph Plat?, 
which has a bronze statue of King Max, a seated figure, 
and some elaborate bas-reliefs, is another front of the 
palace, the Konigsbau, an imitation, not fully carried 
out, of the Pitti Palace, at Florence. Between these is 
the old Residenz, adorned with fountain groups and 
statues in bronze. On another side are the church and 
theatre of the Residenz. The interior of this court 
chapel is dazzling in appearance : the pillars are, I 
think, imitation of variegated marble ; the sides are imi- 
tation of the same ; the vaulting is covered with rich fres- 
cos on gold ground. The whole effect is rich, but it is 
not at all sacred. Indeed, there is no church in Munich, 
except the old cathedral, the Frauenkirche, with its 
high Gothic arches, stained windows, and dusty old carv- 
ings, that gives one at all the sort of feeling that it is 
supposed a church should give. The court chapel in- 
terior is boastingly said to resemble St. Mark's, in Venice. 
You see how far imitation of the classic and Italian is 
carried here in Munich ; so, as I said, the buildings need 
the southern sunlight. Fortunately, they get the right 
quality much of the time. The Glyptothck, a Grecian 
structure of one story, erected to hold the treasures of 
classic sculpture that King LudAvig collected, has a 
beautiful Ionic porch and pediment. On the outside are 
niches filled with statues. In the pure sunshine and 
under a deep blue sky, its white marble glows with an 
almost ethereal beauty. Opposite stands another suc- 
cessful imitation of the Grecian style of architecture, — a 
building with a Corinthian porch, also of white marble. 
These, with the Propylaeum, before mentioned, come out 
wonderfully against a blue sky. A few squares distant 
is the Pinakothek, with its treasures of old pictures, and 
beyond it the New Pinakothek, containing works of mod- 
ern artists. Its exterior is decorated with frescos, from 
designs by Kaulbach : these certainly appear best in a 
sparkling light ; though I am bound to say that no light 
can make very much of them. 



OUTSIDE ASPECTS OF MUNTCH. loi 

Yet Munich is not all imitation. Its finest street, the 
Maximilian, built by the late king of that name, is of a 
novel and wholly modern style of architecture, not an 
imitation, though it may remind some of the new por- 
tions of Paris. It runs for three-quarters of a mile, be- 
ginning with the post-office and its colonnades, with 
frescos on one side, and the Hof Theatre, with its pedi- 
ment frescos, the largest opera-house in Germany, I 
believe; with stately buildings adorned with statues, 
and elegant shops, down to the swift-flowing Isar, which 
is spanned by a handsome bridge; or rather by two 
bridges, for the Isar is partly turned from its bed above, 
and made to turn wheels and drive machinery. At the 
lower end the street expands into a handsome platz, with 
young shade-trees, plats of grass, and gay beds of flow- 
ers. I look out on it as I write ; and I see across the 
Isar the college building begun by Maximilian for the 
education of government officers ; and I see that it is 
still unfinished, indeed, a staring mass of brick, with 
unsightly scafiblding and gaping windows. Money was 
left to complete it ; but the young king, who does not 
care for architecture, keeps only a mason or two on the 
brick work, and an artist on the exterior frescos. At 
this rate the Cologne Cathedral will be finished and 
decay before this is built. On either side of it, on the 
elevated bank of the river, stretch beautiful grounds, 
with green lawns, fiiie trees, and well-kept walks. 

Not to mention the English Garden in speaking of the 
outside aspects of the city, would be a great oversight. 
It was laid out originally by the munificent American, 
Count Rumford, and is called English, I suppose, because 
it is not in the artificial Continental style. Paris has 
nothing to compare with i"*. for natural beauty, — Paris, 
which cannot let a tree g.ow, but mu«t clip it down to 
suit French taste. It is a noble park four miles in 
length, and perhaps a quarter of that in width, — a park 
of splendid old trees, grand, sweeping avenues, open 
glades of free-growing grass, with delicious, shady walks, 




charming drives, and rivers of water. For the Isar is 
trained to flow through it in two rapid streams, under 
bridges and over rapids, and by willow-hung banks. 
There is not wanting even a lake ; and there is, I am 
sorry to say, a temple on a mound, quite in the classic 
style, from which one can see the sun set behind the 
many spires of Munich. At the Chinese Tower two 
military bands play every Saturday evening in the sum- 
mer ; and thither the carriages drive, and the prome- 
naders assemble there, Between five and six o'clock ; and 
while the bands play, the Germans drink beer, and smoke 
cigars, and the fashionably-attired young men walk round 
and round the circle, and the smart young soldiers ex- 
hibit their handsome uniforms, and stride about with 
clanking swords. 

We felicitated ourselves that we should have no lack 
of music when we came to Munich. I think we have 
not ; though the opera has only just begun, and it is the 
vacation of the Conservatoire. There are first the mili- 
tary bands : there is continually a parade somewhere,
