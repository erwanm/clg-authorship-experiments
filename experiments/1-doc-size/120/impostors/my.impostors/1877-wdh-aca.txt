what a good, kind-hearted fellow you are, I should 
say you were the greatest ruffian alive." 

Bartlett) with a groan : " Go on ! That 's some- 
thing like." 

Cummings : " I couldn't hear what was going 
on I 'll own I tried but I could see ; and to 
see the delicate amende she was trying to offer 
you, in such a way that it should not seem an 
amende, a perfect study of a woman's gra- 
cious, unconscious art, and then to see your sour 
refusal of it all, it made me sick." 

Bartlett with a desperate clutch at his face, like 
a man oppressed with some stifling vapor : " Yes, 
yes ! I saw it all, too ! And if it had been for me, 
I would have given anything for such happiness. 
Oh, gracious powers ! How dear she is ! I would 
rather have suffered any anguish than give her 
pain, and yet I gave her pain ! I knew how it 
entered her heart : I felt it in my own. But 




what could I do ? If I am to be myself, if I am 
not to steal the tenderness meant for another 
man, the love she shows to me because I 'in like 
somebody else, I must play the brute. But have a 
little mercy on me. At least, I 'm a baited brute. 
I don't know which way to turn, I don't know 
what to do. She 's so dear to me, so dear in 
every tone of her voice, every look of her eyes, 
every aspiration or desire of her transparent soul, 
that it seems to me my whole being is nothing but 
a thought of her. I loved her helplessness, her 
pallor, her sorrow ; judge how I adore her return 
to something like life ! Oh, you blame me ! You 
simplify this infernal perplexity of mine and label 
it brutality, and scold me for it. Great heaven ! 
And yet you saw, you heard how she entered this 
room. In that instant the old illusion was back 
on her, and I was nothing. All that I had been 
striving and longing to be to her, and hoping and 
despairing to seem, was swept out of existence ; I 
was reduced to a body without a soul, to a shadow, 
a counterfeit! You think I resented it? Poor 
girl, I pitied her so ; and my own heart all the 



 

time like lead in my breast, a dull lump of ache! 
I swear, I wonder I don't go mad. I suppose 
why, I suppose I am insane. No man in his senses 
was ever bedeviled by such a maniacal hallucina- 
tion. Look here, Cummings: tell me that this 
damnable coil isn't simply a matter of my own 
fancy. It'll be some little relief to know that it's 
real. 

Cummings: "It's real enough, my dear fellow. 
And it is a trial, more than I could have be- 
lieved such a fantastic thing could be." 

Bartlett: " Trial? Ordeal by fire! Torment! I 
can't stand it any longer." 

Cumminys, musingly : " She is beautiful, isn't 
she, with that faint dawn of red in her cheeks, 
not a color, but a colored light like the light that 
hangs round a rose-tree's boughs in the early 
spring! And what a magnificent movement, what 
a stately grace ! The girl must have been a god- 
dess!" 

Bartlett: "And now she's a saint for sweet- 
ness and patience! You think she 's had nothing 
to suffer before from me ? You know me better ! 
Well, I 'm going away." 



 

Cummings: Perhaps it will be the best. You 
can go back with me to-morrow." 

Bartlett: "To morrow? Go back with you to- 
morrow? What are you talking about, man?" 
Cummings smiles. "I can't go to-morrow. I 
can't leave her hating me." --. 

Cummin gs: " I knew you never meant to go. 
Well, what will you do ? " 

Bartlett: "Don't be so cold-blooded! What 
would you do ? " 

Cummings: "I would have it out, somehow." 

Bartlett : " Oh, you talk ! How ? " 

Cummings: "I am not in love with Miss 
Wyatt." 

Bartlett : " Oh, don't try to play the cynic with 
me ! It doesn't become you. I know I Ve used 
you badly at times, Cummings. I behaved abomi- 
nably in leaving you to take the brunt of meeting 
General Wyatt that first day ; I said so then, and 
f shall always say it. But I thought you had for- 
given that." 

Cummings, with a laugh : " You make it hard to 
treat you seriously, Bartlett. What do you want
