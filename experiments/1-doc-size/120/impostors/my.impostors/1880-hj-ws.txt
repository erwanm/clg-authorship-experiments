pends upon me, you see." 





" All, that's very proper ; family feeling is very 
proper," said Doctor Sloper. " I often think there 
is not enough of it in our city. I think I have 
heard of your sister." 

" It is possible, but I rather doubt it ; she lives so 
very quietly." 

"As quietly, you mean," the Doctor went on, with 
a short laugh, " as a lady may do who has several 
young children." 

" Ah, my little nephews and nieces that's the very 
point ! I am helping to bring them up," said Mor- 
ris Townsend. " I am a kind of amateur tutor ; I 
give them lessons." 

" That's very proper, as I say ; but it is hardly a 
career." 

" It won't make my fortune," the young man 
confessed. 

" You must not be too much bent on a fortune," 
said the Doctor. " But I assure you I will keep you 
in mind ; I won't lose sight of you." 

" If my situation becomes desperate I shall per- 
haps take the liberty of reminding you," Morris re- 
joined, raising his voice a little, with a brighter smile, 
as his interlocutor turned away. 

Before he left the house the Doctor had a few 
words with Mrs. Almond. 

" I should like to see his sister," he said. " What 
do you call her Mrs. Montgomery ? I should like 
to have a little talk with her." 

" I will try and manage it," Mrs. Almond re- 
sponded. " I will take the first opportunity of in- 
viting her, and you shall come and meet her ; 
unless, indeed," Mrs. Almond added, " she first 





takes it into her head to be sick and to send for 
you." 

"Ah no, not that ; she must have trouble enough 
without that. But it would have its advantages, for 
then I should see the children. I should like very 
much to see the children." 

"You are very thorough. Do you want to cate- 
chise them about their uncle ?" 

" Precisely. Their uncle tells me he has charge 
of their education, that he saves their mother the ex- 
pense of school-bills. I should like to ask them a 
few questions in the commoner branches." 

" He certainly has not the cut of a school-mas- 
ter," Mrs. Almond said to herself a short time after- 
ward, as she saw Morris Townsend in a corner bend- 
ing over her niece, who was seated. 

And there was, indeed, nothing in the young 
man's discourse at this moment that savored of the 
pedagogue. 

"Will you meet me somewhere to-morrow or 
next day ?" he said, in a low tone, to Catherine. 

" Meet you ?" she asked, lifting her frightened eyes. 

" I have something particular to say to you very 
particular." 

" Can't you come to the house ? Can't you say it 
there ?" 

Townsend shook his head gloomily. " I can't en- 
ter your doors again." 

" Oh, Mr. Townsend !" murmured Catherine. She 
trembled as she wondered what had happened 
whether her father had forbidden it. 

" I can't, in self-respect," said the young man. 
" Your father has insulted rne." 





"Insulted you?" 

" He has taunted me with my poverty." 

" Oh, you are mistaken you misunderstood him !" 
Catherine spoke with energy, getting up from her 
chair. 

"Perhaps I am too proud too sensitive. But 
would you have me otherwise ?" he asked, tenderly. 

" Where my father is concerned, you must not be 
sure. He is full of goodness," said Catherine. 

" He laughed at me for having no position. I 
took it quietly ; but only because he belongs to you."
