" You speak as if it surprised you." 

" It is immense ; there will be a great deal to ob- 
serve." 

" You are shockingly cold - blooded !" said Mrs. 
Almond. 

" I need to be, with all this hot blood about me. 
Young Townsend, indeed, is cool ; I must allow him 
that merit." 

" I can't judge him," Mrs. Almond answered ; 
" but I am not at all surprised at Catherine." 





" I confess I am a little ; she must have been so 
deucedly divided and bothered." 

" Say it amuses you outright. I don't see why it 
should be such a joke that your daughter adores 
you." 

" It is the point where the adoration stops that I 
find it interesting to fix." 

" It stops where the other sentiment begins." 

" Not at all ; that would be simple enough. The 
two things are extremely mixed up, and the mixture 
is extremely odd. It will produce some third ele- 
ment, and that's what I'm waiting to see. I wait 
with suspense with positive excitement ; and that 
is a sort of emotion that I didn't suppose Catherine 
would ever provide for me. I am really very much 
obliged to her." 

" She will cling," said Mrs. Almond ; " she will 
certainly cling." 

" Yes, as I say, she will stick." 

" Cling is prettier. That's what those very sim- 
ple natures always do, and nothing could be sim- 
pler than Catherine. She doesn't take many impres- 
sions ; but when she takes one, she keeps it. She is 
like a copper kettle that receives a dent : you may 
polish up the kettle, but you can't efface the mark." 

" We must try and polish up Catherine," said the 
Doctor. " I will take her to Europe !" 

" She won't forget him in Europe." 

" He will forget her, then." 

Mrs. Almond looked grave. " Should you really 
like that?" 

" Extremely," said the Doctor. 

Mrs. Penniman, meanwhile, lost little time in put- 





ting herself again in communication with Morris 
Townsend. She requested him to favor her with 
another interview, but she did not on this occasion 
select an oyster saloon as the scene of their meeting. 
She proposed that he should join her at the door of 
a certain church after service on Sunday afternoon ; 
and she was careful not to appoint the place of wor- 
ship which she usually visited, and where, as she 
said, the congregation would have spied upon her. 
She picked out a less elegant resort, and on issuing 
from its portal at the hour she had fixed she saw the 
young man standing apart. She offered him no rec- 
ognition until she had crossed the street, and he had 
followed her to some distance. Here, with a smile, 
" Excuse my apparent want of cordiality," she said. 
" You know what to believe about that. Prudence 
before everything." And on his asking her in what 
direction they should walk, " Where we shall be least 
observed," she murmured. 

Morris was not in high good -humor, and his re- 
sponse to this speech was not particularly gallant. 
" I don't flatter myself we shall be much observed 
anywhere." Then he turned recklessly toward the 
centre of the town. "I hope you have come to tell 
me that he has knocked under," he went on. 

" I am afraid I am not altogether a harbinger of 
good ; and yet, too, I am to a certain extent a mes- 
senger of peace. I have been thinking a great deal, 
Mr. Townsend," said Mrs. Penniman. 

" You think too much." 

" I suppose I do ; but I can't help it, my mind is 
so terribly active. When I give myself, I give my- 
self. I pay the penalty in my headaches, my fa- 





mous headaches a perfect circlet of pain ! But I 
carry it as a queen carries her crown. Would you 
believe that I have one now ? I wouldn't, however, 
have missed our rendezvous for anything. I have 
something very important to tell you." 

" Well, let's have it," said Morris.
