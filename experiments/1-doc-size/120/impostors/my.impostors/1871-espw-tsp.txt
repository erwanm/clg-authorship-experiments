" Oh ! " said Miss Kelso. 

" For two, you see," said Sip. 

" But all this, — you cannot have all this to do 
after you have stood eleven hours and a half at 
your loom .' " 

" When should I have it to do ! There 's Sunday, 
to be sure ; but I don't do so much now Sundays,
except the washing and the brushing up. 
I like,'' with a gentle, quick look at the deaf and 
dumb girl, who still sat dipping bread crusts into 





black molasses, absorbed and still, " to make it a 
kind of a comfortable day for Catty, Sunday. 
I don't bother Catty so much to help me, you 
know," added' Sip, cheerfully. " I like," with
another very pleasant look, " to make it comfortable 
for Catty." 

" I went into the mills to-day," said Miss Kelso, 
in reply. It was not very much to the point as a 
reply, and was said with an interrogatory accent, 
which lessened its aptness. 

" Yes .'' " said Sip, in the same tone. 

" I never was in a mill before." 

" No ? " 

" No." 

There was a pause, in which the young lady 
seemed to be waiting for a leading question, like a 
puzzled scholar. If she were, she had none. Sip 
sat with her dogged smile, and snapped little paper 
balls into the fire. 

" I thought it rather close in the mills." 

" Yes .? " 

"And — dirty. And — there was one very 
warm room ; the overseer advised me not to go in." 

" It was very good advice." 

" I went into the Company boarding-house too." 





"For the first time?" 

" For the first time. I went to inquire after 
you. The landlady took me about. Now I think 
of it, she invited me to tea." 

" Why didn't you stay .? " 

" Why, to tell the truth, the — tablecloth was 
— rather dirty." 

" Oh ! " 

" And I saw her wipe her face on — the dish- 
towel. Do the girls often sleep six in a room .' 
They had no wash-stands. I saw some basins 
set on trunks. They carried all the water up and 
down stairs themselves ; there were two or three 
flights. There wasn't a ventilator in the house. 
I saw a girl there sick." 

" Sick ? O, Bert Bush. Yes. Pleurisy. She 's 
going to work her notice when she gets about 
again. Given out." 

" She coughed while I was there. I thought 
her room was rather cold. I thought all the 
rooms were rather cold. I didn't seem to see 
any fire for anybody, except in the common 
sitting-room. But tjie bread was sweet." 

" Yes, the bread was sweet." 

"And the gingerbread." 





" Very sweet." 

" And, I suppose, the board — 

" The board is quarter of a dollar cheaper than 
in other places." 

Sip stopped snapping paper balls into the fire, 
and snapped instead one of her shrewd, sidewise 
glances at her visitor's face. 

The fine, fair, finished face ! How puzzled it 
looked ! Sip smiled. 

Catty had crept around while they were talk- 
ing, and sat upon the floor by Miss Kelso's chair. 
She was still amusing herself with the young 
lady's dress, passing her wise fingers to and fro 
across its elegant surface, and nodding to herself 
in her dull way. Miss Kelso's hand, the one with 
the rings, lay upon her lap, and Catty, attracted
