George’s lively journals, written when he was abroad. You remember
how we used to laugh over them when he sent them home? Well, when I
was begged to give them an evening, I resolved to try one of those
amusing journal-letters, and chose the best,--all about how George
and a friend went to the different places Dickens describes in some
of his funny books. I wish you could have seen how those dear girls
enjoyed it, and laughed till they cried over the dismay of the boys,
when they knocked at a door in Kingsgate Street, and asked if Mrs.
Gamp lived there. It was actually a barber’s shop, and a little man,
very like Poll Sweedlepipes, told them ‘Mrs. Britton was the nuss as
lived there now.’ It upset those rascals to come so near the truth,
and they ran away because they couldn’t keep sober.”

The members of the club indulged in a general smile as they recalled
the immortal Sairey with “the bottle on the mankle-shelf,” the
“cowcuber,” and the wooden pippins. Then Anna continued, with an air
of calm satisfaction, quite sure now of her audience and herself,--

“It was a great success. So I went on, and when the journals were
done, I used to read other things, and picked up books for their
library, and helped in any way I could, while learning to know them
better and give them confidence in me. They are proud and shy, just
as we should be but if you REALLY want to be friends and don’t mind
rebuffs now and then, they come to trust and like you, and there is
so much to do for them one never need sit idle any more. I won’t
give names, as they don’t like it, nor tell how I tried to serve
them, but it is very sweet and good for me to have found this work,
and to know that each year I can do it better and better. So I feel
encouraged and am very glad I began, as I hope you all are. Now, who
comes next?”

As Anna ended, the needles dropped and ten soft hands gave her a
hearty round of applause; for all felt that she had done well, and
chosen a task especially fitted to her powers, as she had money,
time, tact, and the winning manners that make friends everywhere.

Beaming with pleasure at their approval, but feeling that they made
too much of her small success, Anna called the club to order by
saying, “Ella looks as if she were anxious to tell her experiences,
so perhaps we had better ask her to hold forth next.”

“Hear! hear!” cried the girls; and, nothing loath, Ella promptly
began, with twinkling eyes and a demure smile, for HER story ended
romantically.

“If you are interested in shop-girls, Miss President and ladies, you
will like to know that I am one, at least a silent partner and
co-worker in a small fancy store at the West End.”

“No!” exclaimed the amazed club with one voice; and, satisfied with
this sensational beginning Ella went on.

“I really am, and you have bought some of my fancy-work. Isn’t that
a good joke? You needn’t stare so, for I actually made that
needle-book, Anna, and my partner knit Lizzie’s new cloud. This is
the way it all happened. I didn’t wish to waste any time, but one
can’t rush into the street and collar shabby little girls, and say,
‘Come along and learn to sew,’ without a struggle, so I thought I’d
go and ask Mrs. Brown how to begin. Her branch of the Associated
Charities is in Laurel Street, not far from our house, you know; and
the very day after our last meeting I posted off to get my ‘chore.’
I expected to have to fit work for poor needlewomen, or go to see
some dreadful sick creature, or wash dirty little Pats, and was
bracing up my mind for whatever might come, as I toiled up the hill
in a gale of wind. Suddenly my hat flew off and went gayly skipping
away, to the great delight of some black imps, who only grinned and
cheered me on as I trotted after it with wild grabs and wrathful
dodges. I got it at last out of a puddle, and there I was in a nice
mess. The elastic was broken, feather wet, and the poor thing all
mud and dirt. I didn’t care much, as it was my old one,--dressed for
my work, you see. But I couldn’t go home bareheaded, and I didn’t
know a soul in that neighborhood. I turned to step into a grocery
store at the corner, to borrow a brush or buy a sheet of paper to
wear, for I looked like a lunatic with my battered hat and my hair
in a perfect mop. Luckily I spied a woman’s fancy shop on the other
corner, and rushed in there to hide myself, for the brats hooted and
people stared. It was a very small shop, and behind the counter sat
a tall, thin, washed-out-looking woman, making a baby’s hood. She
looked poor and blue and rather sour, but took pity on me; and while
she sewed the cord, dried the feather, and brushed off the dirt, I
warmed myself and looked about to see what I could buy in return for
her trouble.

“A few children’s aprons hung in the little window, with some knit
lace, balls, and old-fashioned garters, two or three dolls, and a
very poor display of small wares. In a show-case, however, on the
table that was the counter, I found some really pretty things, made
of plush, silk, and ribbon, with a good deal of taste. So I said I’d
buy a needle-book, and a gay ball, and a pair of distracting baby’s
shoes, made to look like little open-work socks with pink
ankle-ties, so cunning and dainty, I was glad to get them for Cousin
Clara’s baby. The woman seemed pleased, though she had a grim way of
talking, and never smiled once. I observed that she handled my hat
as if used to such work, and evidently liked to do it. I thanked her
for repairing damages so quickly and well, and she said, with my hat
on her hand, as if she hated to part with it, ‘I’m used to
millineryin’ and never should have give it up, if I didn’t have my
folks to see to. I took this shop, hopin’ to make things go, as such
a place was needed round here, but mother broke down, and is a sight
of care; so I couldn’t leave her, and doctors is expensive, and
times hard, and I had to drop my trade, and fall back on pins and
needles, and so on.’”

Ella was a capital mimic, and imitated the nasal tones of the
Vermont woman to the life, with a doleful pucker of her own blooming
face, which gave such a truthful picture of poor Miss Almira Miller
that those who had seen her recognized it at once, and laughed
gayly.

“Just as I was murmuring a few words of regret at her bad luck,”
 continued Ella, “a sharp voice called out from a back room, ‘Almiry!
Almiry! come here.’ It sounded very like a cross parrot, but it was
the old lady, and while I put on my hat I heard her asking who was
in the shop, and what we were ‘gabbin’ about.’ Her daughter told
her, and the old soul demanded to ‘see the gal;’ so I went in, being
ready for fun as usual. It was a little, dark, dismal place, but as
neat as a pin, and in the bed sat a regular Grandma Smallweed
smoking a pipe, with a big cap, a snuff-box, and a red cotton
handkerchief. She was a tiny, dried-up thing, brown as a berry, with
eyes like black beads, a nose and chin that nearly met, and hands
