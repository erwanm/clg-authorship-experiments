She stopped. And he asked, to prompt her, " Yes ?" 

" Thank you," she answered, piteously. And she 
added, with superficial inconsequence, " I shall always 
think you were very cruel." 

He did not pretend not to know what she meant, and 
he said, " I shall always think so, too. I tried to re- 
venge myself for the hurt your harmless hoax did my 
vanity. Of course, I made believe at the time that I 
was doing an act of justice, but I never was able to 
brave it out afterwards." 

" But you were — you were doing an act of justice. 
I deserved what you said, but I didn't deserve what has 
followed. I meant no harm — it was a silly prank, and 
I have suffered for it as if it were a crime, and the 
consequences are not ended yet. I should think that, if 
there is a moral government of the universe, the Judge 
of all the earth would know when to hold His hand. 
And now the worst of it is to come yet." She caught 
Verrian's arm, as if for help. 

" Don't — don't !" he besought her. " What will peo- 
ple think?" 

" Yes, yes !" she owned, releasing him and withdraw- 
ing to the other end of the seat. 

 

" But it almost drives me wild. What shall I do ? 
You ought to know. It is your fault. You have 
frightened me out of daring to tell the truth." 

Had he, indeed, done that? Verrian asked himself, 
and it seemed to him that he had done something like it. 
If it was so, he must help her over her fear now. He 
answered, bluntly, harshly : " You must tell him all 
about it — " 

" But if he won't believe me ? Do you think he will 
believe me ? Would you believe me ?" 

" You have nothing to do with that. There is nothing 
for you but to tell him the whole story. You mustn't 
share such a secret with any one but your husband. 
When you tell him it will cease to be my secret." 

" Yes, yes." 

" Well, then, you must tell him, unless — " 

" Yes," she prompted. 

Then they were both silent, looking intensely into 
each other's eyes. In that moment all else of life 
seemed to melt and swim away from Verrian and leave 
him stranded upon an awful eminence confronting 
her. 

" Hello, hello !" a gay voice called, as if calling to 
them both. " What are you two conspiring ?" Bush- 
wick, as suddenly as if he had fallen from the sky or 
started up from the earth, stood before them, and gave 
a hand to each — his right to Verrian, his left to Miss 
Shirley. " How are you, Verrian ? How are you, Miss 
Shirley ?" He mocked her in the formality of his ad- 
dress. " I've been shadowing you ever since you came 
into the park, but I thought I wouldn't interrupt till 
you seemed to have got through your conversation. May 
I ask what it was all about ? It seemed very absorbing, 
from a respectful distance." 

" Very absorbing, indeed," Miss Shirley said, making 
 

room for him between them. " Sit down and let me tell 
you. You're to be a partner in the secret." 

" Silent partner," Bushwick suggested. 

" I hope you'll always be silent," the girl shared in 
his drolling. She began and told the whole story to 
the last detail, sparing neither herself nor Verrian, 
who listened as if he were some one else not concerned, 
and kept saying to himself, " What courage !" Bush- 
wick listened as mutely, with a face that, to Verrian's 
eye, seemed to harden from its light jocosity into a 
severity he had not seen in it before. " It was some- 
thing," she ended towards Bushwick, with a catch in her 
breath, " that you had to know." 

" Yes," he answered, tonelessly. 

" And now — she attempted a little forlorn play- 
fulness — " don't you think he gave me what I de- 
served ?" 

Bushwick rose up and took her hand under his arm, 
keeping his left hand upon hers. 

"He! Who?" 

" Mr. Verrian." 

" I don't know any Mr. Verrian. Come, you'll take 
cold here." 

He turned his back on Verrian, who fancied a tremor 
in her hat, as if she would look round at him ; but then, 
as if she divined Bushwick's intention, she did not look 
round, and together they left him. 

It was days before Verrian could confess himself 
of the fact to his mother, who listened with the justice 
instinctive in her. She still had not spoken when he 
ended, and he said, " I have thought it all over, and 
I feel that he did right. He did the only thing that 
a man in love with her could do. And I don't wonder
