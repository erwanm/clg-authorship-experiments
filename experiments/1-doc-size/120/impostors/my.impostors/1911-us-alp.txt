THE CAPTIVE IN LEASH 



They were standing on the hill-top, watching the 
last glimmer of the sinking moon. As the faint per- 
fume of the clover came to them upon the warm eve- 
ning wind, she sighed, and whispered 

: 'Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here! 
'Mid city noise, not as with thee of yore, 
Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home! 

She paused. 

"Go 07?," he said, and she quoted- 

"Then through the great town's harsh, he art -weary ing 

roar, 
Let in thy voice a whisper always come, 

To chase fatigue and fear: 
Why faintest thou? I wandered till I died. 

on! The light we sought is shining still." 



1. THYRSIS made his plans and packed his few 
belongings. There came another pass from the "higher 
regions", and he took the night-train once more, and 
came to the little town upon the shores of Lake On- 
tario. Once more the sun shone on the crystal-green 
water, and the cold breeze blew from off the lake. There 
was still snow in the ravines of the deep woods, but 
Thvrsis got his tent out of the farmer's barn, and 
patched up the holes the mice had gnawed, and put it 
up on the old familiar spot. 

It was strange to him to be there without Corydon. 
There were so many things to remind him of her 
a sudden memory would catch him unawares, and stab 
him like a knife. There was the rocky headland where 
they had swam, and there was the pine-tree that the 
lightning had splintered, one day while they were stand- 
ing near. When darkness came, and he was unpacking 
a few old things that they had left up in the country, 
his loneliness seemed to him almost more than he could 
bear ; he sat by the little stove, holding a pair of her 
old faded slippers in his hands, and felt his tears trick- 
ling down upon them. 

But it took him only a day or two to drive such 
things out of his mind. There was no time for senti- 
ment now it was "Clear ship for action !" For once 
in his life he was free, and had a chance to work. He 
was full of his talk with Mr. Ardsley, and meant to 
do his best to be "practical." And so behold him wan- 
dering about in the water-soaked forests, or tramping 





 

the muddy roads, or sitting by his little stove while 
the cold storms beat upon the tent wrestling with 
his unruly Pegasus, and dragging it back a hundred 
times a day to what was proper, and human, and in- 
teresting ! 

The neighbors had warned him that it was too early 
for tenting, but Thyrsis had vowed he would stand it. 
And now, as if to punish him for his defiance, there 
was emptied out upon him the cave of all the winds ; 
for four weeks there were such storms of rain and sleet 
and snow as the region had never known in April. 
There were nights when he sat wrapped in overcoats 
and blankets, with a fire in the stove; and still shiver- 
ing for the gale that drove through the canvas. 
There came one calm, starlit night when he lay for 
hours almost frozen, and sat up in the morning to find 
a glass of water at his bedside frozen solid. Thirteen 
degrees the thermometer showed, according to the 
farmer; and oh, the agony of getting out of bed, and 
starting a fire with green wood! In the end Thyrsis 
poured in half a can of kerosene, and got the stove red- 
hot; and then he turned round to warm his back, and 
smelled smoke, and whirled about to find his tent in a 
blaze ! 

With a bucket of water and a broomstick he beat out 
the fire, and went for a run to warm up. But when 
he came back there was more wind, so that he could not 
keep warm in the tent, and more rain, so that he could 
not find shelter in the woods. In the end he discovered 
a ruined barn, in a corner of which he would sit, 
wrapped in his blankets and writing with cold fingers. 

Perhaps all these mishaps had something to do with 
the refusal of his ideas to flow. But apparently it was 
in vain that Thyrsis tried at any time to work at things 



thcit were interesting to other people. Perhaps he 
could have worked better at them, if there had not been 
so many things that were interesting to him. He 
would find himself confronted with the image of the 
society clergyman, or of the sleek editor in his club, 
or some other memory out of the world of luxury and 
pride. And each day came the newspaper, with its 
burden of callousness and scorn ; and perhaps also a 
letter from Corydon, with something to goad him to 
new tilts with the enemies of his soul. 

So, before long, almost without realizing it, he was 
putting the "interesting" things aside, and girding
