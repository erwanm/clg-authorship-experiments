up high and higher. This came at once from the 
sight of the gentleman who entered to kiss Mrs. 
Midmore's hand before he did anything else, 
though indeed he gave Ralph a glance by the 
way, and of whom our young man at once con 
veniently noted that he performed the pretty 
act not at all as by prescription but somehow as 
by special inspiration, or even by the custom 
of oddity. He made a difference, the quickest 
his arrival made it, and his look at Ralph and his 
fine good-morning to the others, before he had 
spoken a word but this last; the difference, that 
is, of replacing by their interest in his presence 
a certain self-consciousness on the part of each 
of the four into which their commerce of the last 
ten minutes had perhaps a trifle awkwardly 
tightened. And this verily, wasn't it? just by 
no more than the glance of his eye, a small sharp 
eye in a long narrow face, giving a sense as it 
did on the spot for Ralph's imagination to Mrs. 





  

Midmore's warrant of his keenness. Was it any 
thing more than that he was intelligent ? though 
why if it wasn't could Ralph's heart leap up so 
without thereby implying that the others, the 
so agreeable others (for hadn't Perry turned 
agreeable too !) had beguiled him but with the 
common ? However the question hovered but 
to drop, for there was no conceivable tribute to 
taste that his grand kinswoman didn't seem to 
render as she said to her new visitor: "I desire 
your acquaintance for our cousin Mr. Pendrel 
a faraway cousin, but a near relation of another 
sort, as he is about to become my son-in-law." 

"Do you settle such grand matters in the turn 
of a hand ? if, as I gather, Mr. Pendrel, whom 
I rejoice to see, has scarce had time to draw 
breath in your house!" Sir Cantopher addressed 
this to the others, but paying Ralph the com 
pliment of it, as our young man felt, and letting 
him see that he might figure for unduly driven 
should he choose. It took, however, but this 
first vision of his fellow-visitor to put such a 
choice quite out of the question; the effect of 
this gentleman was so to make him throb again 
with the responsive curiosity that had carried 
him the whole length of his first initiation. That 
tide was once more full and strong, for here was 
a new relation, of the liveliest, which was already 
in the brief moment drawing him on and which 
in fact had in its different way as much force 








  

to that end, whatever the end might prove, as 
had been put forth for his original welcome by 
Molly herself. Molly had desired him, and Molly 
still did, as much as ever, he perfectly felt, all 
outer ruffles of accident notwithstanding, just as 
his own strongest pulse beat upon her for its 
satisfaction with a quickness undiminished; but 
the very face and air and note of the man before 
him, and who was as much taken with him, in 
the way of wonder, he could see, as he was him 
self taken, now multiplied at a stroke his rela 
tions with his actual world. Sir Cantopher's 
forehead was high and his chin long, without 
other fulness, as was also his nose; his mouth, 
with its thin tight edges and its inconsiderable 
size, repeated to the attention the fashion of his 
eyes and their drawn lids, which showed the 
sharpness of the pupil intermittently, much as 
the lips, opening too little, showed the gleam of 
scarce more than a couple of such teeth as would 
have announced on more liberal terms a proper 
array. Sir Cantopher's facial terms were pre 
cisely not liberal in the sense, as we might have 
put it, that they made, in spite of resources close 
at hand, a hard bargain with expression; Ralph 
even noting for it at once that he had his aspect 
certainly, and that one took it somehow as a 
thing of high sufficiency, if not of beauty or 
symmetry, but that not less surely, should it 
continue to be denied larger play, it would have 





  

to do, unlike even the Greek theatric mask, both 
for tragedy and comedy. Would one ever, 
without other help, know which of the two he 
fixedly meant ? though doubtless he was mean 
ing comedy now and moreover was, by some in 
describable art and unsupported by a single direct 
grace, expressing a high degree of elegance and 
of consequence. It might be a small world in 
which he so much mattered, but there was ex 
actly the charm, or at least the challenge 
curiosity always predominant that one might 
come quite to learn and to enjoy his conditions. 
His shoulders sloped, his stature but sufficed, and 
wasn't some slight deflection from the straight 
to be confessed to by his extraordinarily thin
