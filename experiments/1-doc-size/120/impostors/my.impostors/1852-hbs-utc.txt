woman's brow, and that she answered rapidly, and with 
great vehemence. 

"I don't believe it; I won't believe it!" he heard her 
say. " You're jist a foolin' with me." 

" If you won't believe it, look here !" said the man, drawing out a paper; "this yer's the bill of sale, and there's 
your master's name to it ; and I paid down good solid cash 
for it, too, I can tell you so now !" 

" I don't believe mas'r would cheat me so ; it can't be 
true !" said the woman with increasing agitation. 

" You can ask any of these men here that can read 
writing. Here!" he said, to a man that was passing by, 
" jis read this yer, won't you ! This yer gal won't believe 
me, when I tell her what 'tis." 

" Why, it's a bill of sale, signed by John Eosdick," said 
the man, " making over to you the girl Lucy and her child. 
It's all straight enough, for aught I see." 

The woman's passionate exclamations collected a crowd 
around her, and the trader briefly explained to them the 
cause of the agitation. 

" He told me that I was going down to Louisville, to hire 
out as cook to the same tavern where my husband works ; 
that's what mas'r told me, his own self, and I can't believe 
he'd lie to me," said the woman. = ' 

" But he has sold you, my poor woman, there's no doubt 
about it," said a good-natured looking man, who had been 
examining the papers ; "he has done it, and no mistake." 

" Then it's no account talking," said the woman, suddenly 
growing quite calm ; and, clasping her child tighter in her 
arms, she sat down on her box, turned her back round, and 
gazed listlessly into the river. 

" G-oing to take it easy, after all !" said the trader. " Gal's 
got grit, I see." 

The woman looked calm as the boat went on ; and a 
beautiful, soft, summer breeze passed, like a compassionate 
spirit, over her head the gentle breeze that never inquires 
whether the brow is dusky or fair that it fans. And she 
saw sunshine sparkling on the water, in golden ripples, and 
heard gay voices, full of ease and pleasure, talking around 
her everywhere ; but her heart lay as if a great stone had 
fallen on it. Her babv raised himself up against her, and 





stroked her cheeks with his little hands ; and, springing up 
and down, crowing and chatting, seemed determined to 
arouse her. She strained him suddenly and tightly in her 
arms, and slowly one tear after another fell on his wondering, unconscious face : and gradually she seemed, little by 
little, to grow calmer, and busied herself with tending and 
nursing him. 

The child, a boy of ten months, was uncommonly large 
and strong of his age, and very vigorous in his limbs. 
Never for a moment still, he kept his mother constantly 
busy in holding him, and guarding his springing activity. 

"That's a fine chap!" said a man, suddenly stopping 
opposite to him, with his hands in his pockets. " How old 
is he?" 

" Ten months and a half," said the mother. 

The man whistled to the boy, and offered him part of a 
stick of candy, which he eagerly grabbed at, and very soon 
had it in a baby's general depository ; to wit, his mouth. 

" Rum fellow ! " said the man. " Knows what's what !" 
and he whistled and walked on. When he had got to the 
other side of the boat, he came across Haley, who was 
smoking on top of a pile of boxes. 

The stranger produced a match and lighted a cigar, 
saying, as he did so 

"Decentish kind o' wench you've got round there, 
stranger." 

"Why, I reckon she is tol'able fair," said Haley, blowing 
the smoke out of his mouth. 

" Taking her down south ?" said the man. 

Haley nodded and smoked on. 

" Plantation hand ?" said the- man. 

" Wai," said Haley, "I'm filling out an order for a platation, and I think I shall put her in. They telled me she 
was a good cook , and they can use her for that, or set her 
at the cotton-picking. She's got the right fingers for that ; 
I looked at 'em. SeU well, either way ;" and Haley resumed 
his cigar, 

" They won't want the young 'un on a plantation," said 
the man. 

" I shall sell him first chance I find," said Haley, lighting 
another cigar. 





"S'pose you'd be selling him tol' able cheap?" said the 
stranger, mounting the pile of boxes, and sitting down 
comfortably. 

"Don't know 'bout that,'* said Haley; "he's a pretty
