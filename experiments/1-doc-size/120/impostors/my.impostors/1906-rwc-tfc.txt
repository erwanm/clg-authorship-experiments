the punching-bag." 

" So you mean to resist ? " 

" Yes, I do. If I were going to surrender at once, 
I might as well go off to church with you now." 

" Wenniston church ! " he said promptly. " I'll 
order the Mercedes." 

She laughed, lazily settling herself more snugly by 
the fire. " Suppose it were our fire.'' " she smiled. 
" There would be a dog lying across that rug, and a 
comfortable Angora tabby dozing by the fender, and — 
you, cross-legged, at my feet, with that fascinating head 
of yours tipped back against my knees." 

The laughter in her voice died out, and he had risen, 
saying unsteadily : " Don't ! I — I can't stand that 
sort of thing, you know." 









She liad made a mistake, too; she also had suddenly 
become aware of her own limits in the same direction. 

"Forgive me, dear! I meant no mockery." 

" I know. . . . After a while a man finds laughter 
difficult." 

" I was not laughing at — anything. I was only pre- 
tending to be happy." 

" Your happiness is before you," he said sullenly. 

" My future, you mean. You know I am exchang- 
ing one for the other. . . . And some day you will awake 
to the infamy of it; you will comprehend the depravity 
of the monstrous trade I made. . . . And then — and 
then " 

She passed one slim hand over her face — " then you 
will shake yourself free from this dream of me; then, 
awake, my punishment at your hands will begin. . . . 
Dear, no man in his right senses can continue to love a 
girl such as I am. All that is true and ardent and generous in you has invested my physical attractiveness and 
my small intellect with a magic that cannot last, because 
it is magic ; and you are the magician, enmeshed for the 
moment in the mists of your own enchantment. When 
this fades, when you unclose your eyes in clear day- 
light, dear, I dread to think what I shall appear to 
you — what a dreadful, shrunken, bloodless shell, hung 
with lace and scented, silken cerements — a jewelled mum- 
my-case — a thing that never was ! . . . Do you under- 
stand my punishment a little, now.'' " 

" If it were true," he said in a dull voice, " you will 
have forgotten, too." 

" I pray I may," she said under her breath. 

And, after a long silence : " Do you think, before the 
year is out, that you might be granted enough courage.'' " he asked. 





 

" No. I shall not even pray for it. I want what 
is offered me ! I desire it so blindly that already it has 
become part of me. I tell you the poison is in every vein ; 
there is nothing else but poison in me. I am what I 
tell you, to the core. It is past my own strength 
of will to stop me, now. If I am stopped, another 
must do it. My weakness for you, being a treachery 
if not confessed, I was obliged to confess, horribly 
frightened as I was. He might have stopped me; he 
did not. . . . And now, what is there on earth to halt 
me.'' Love cannot. Common decency and courage cannot. Fear of your unhappiness and mine cannot. No, 
even the certitude of your contempt, some day, is powerless to halt me now. I could not love ; I am utterly incapable of loving you enough to balance the sacrifice. 
And that is final." 

Grace Ferrall came into the room and found a duel 
of silence in progress under the dull fire-glow tinting 
the ceiling. ' 

"Another quarrel," she commented, turning on the 
current of the drop-light above the desk from which Si- 
ward had risen at her entrance. " You quarrel enough 
to marry. Why don't you ? " 

" I wish we could," said Sylvia simpl}-. 

Grace laughed. " What a little fool you are ! " she 
said tenderl}, seating herself in Siward's chair and drop- 
ping one hand over his where it rested on the arm. 
" Stephen, can't you make her — a big, strong fellow like 
you .'' Oh, well ; on your heads be it ! My conscience is 
now clear for the first time, and I'll never meddle again." 
She gave Siward's hand a perfunctory pat and released 
him with a discreetly stifled yawn. " I'm disgracefully 
sleepy ; the wind blew like fury along the coast. Sylvia,
