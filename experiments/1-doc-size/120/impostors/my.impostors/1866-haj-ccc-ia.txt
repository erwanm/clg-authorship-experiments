not counsel too great strictness, at first, though I do not 
apprehend that from you. Neither perhaps ought we to 
try to advance very rapidly at first. Step by step, will 

 



be the most judicious way. In regard to hours, text' 
books, and studies generally, you will do as you think 
best." 

   '' I thank you, Mr. Bowman,'' replied Mrs. Codman, 
" for your dependence on my judgment, anS hope to 
deserve it. I hope my young pupil  who, I am con- 
vinced is not wanting in intelligence, will do justice to 
her natural capacity." 

The next day Mrs Codman commenced her under- 
taking, for such it may appropriately be called. 

"Bertha," said she, pointing to the clock, "it is 
nine o'clock. Suppose we commence our studies." 

"Just let me have another race with Topsy," said 
Bert, who was flying round the room in pursuit of the 
black kitten, who was evidently regarded by her young 
mistress as a congenial companion. 

" I am afraid I must say no, my dear child," said 
Mrs. , Codman gsntly ; " there is nothing like punctuality. So if you will just ring the bell, I will ask Jane 
to take away Topsy for the present." 

" Can't Topsy come to school with me?" asked Bert, 
disappointed. 

" I am afraid if she did my other pupil w ould not 
make very much progi'ess." 

Bert unwillingly acquiesced in the dismission of her 
favorite companion. 

" You won't keep me as long as they do in school, 
will you, LIrs. Codman?" asked Bert. " If I had to 
study four or six hours, I should certainly go into a 
a fit." 

" I dare say you would," replied her teacher, smiling. 
'  Therefore I sha'n't keep you so long. In fact, as you 

 



are the only scholar, we sha'n't bind ourselves to so 
many hours, but rather to so much learned, so that it 
will depend a good deal on how well you study.'' 

" That's good," said Bert. " Only, Mrs. Codman, 
you mustn't be too hard upon me. I don't believe I 
can get very lon lessons." 

  I mean to be quite easy at first. I shall not ask 
much, but that little I shall be strict in requiring." 

Bert wasn't quite sure how she liked the latter part 
of this remark. 

'' Before setting you any lessons, I must find out how 
much you know." 

'' I guess it won't take me long to tell you all I ever 
learned." 

'' Here is a reading-book. Let me hear you read." 

Bert took took the book, and stumbled through a 
paragraph, invariably mispronouncing all words of over 
one syllable. 

" There," said she, taking a long breath ; " I'm glad 
that is over." 

''Now," said Mrs. Codman, taking the book, "let 
me read it aloud." 

She was an excellent reader, and Bert, though she 
could not read herself, recognized the fact. 

"I wish I could read as well as that," said Bert. 
" H6w awfully you must have studied when you were a 
girl." 

" Not so hard as you think for, perhaps," said her 
teacher, smiling. " Success depends more upon a 
series of small efforts, than any great one." 

" Do you think I shidi ever read well? " asked Bert, 
doubtfully. 



 



 

"I am sure you will, if you will give a moderate 
amount of attention. Do you know anything of aritb'- 
metic." 

" Do you mean the Multiplication Table?" 

" Yes, that is a part of it." 

" Yes," said Bert, " I know son  lines about it, 
Charlie Morrill taught me them one day." 

"What are they?"
