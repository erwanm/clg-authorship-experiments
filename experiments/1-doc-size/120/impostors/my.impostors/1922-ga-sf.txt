had taken advantage of the opportunity given 
you by Sally I think they would have guarded 
your secret. You have publicly disgraced them 
as well as yourself and your husband." 

" Well, what shall you do ? Throw me into 
the street? I wish that you would." 

" No, I shall try to cure you again." 

^ And have a wife that your friends will cut 
dead ? You'd be far better ofF if I were dead." 

" Perhaps. But I shall do my duty. And if 
I can cure you I'll sell my practice and go elsewhere. To South America, perhaps." 

" Scandal travels. You would never get 
away from it. Better stay here with your 
friends, who will not visit my sins on your head. 
They will never desert you. And you cannot 
cure me. Did you ever know any one to be 
cured against his will ? " 

" I shall lock you in these rooms and you 
can't drink what you haven't got." 

^< I've circumvented you before and I shall 
again." 

" Then," he cried violently, " I'll put you in 
the Home for Inebriates ! " 

She laughed mockingly. " You'll never do 
anything of the $ort. And I shouldn't care if 
you did. I should escape." 



 

" Have you no pride left ? " 

" It is as dead as everything else but this 
miserable shell. As dead as all that was great 
in Langdon Masters. Won't you let me die 
in my own way ? " 

« I will not." 

She sighed and moved her head restlessly on 
the pillow. " You mean to do what is right, 
I suppose. But you are cruel, cruel. You 
condemn me to live in torment." 

" I shall give you more for a while than I 
did before. I was too abrupt. I wouldn't 
face the whole truth, I suppose." 

« Pll kill myself." 

" I have no fear of that. You are as superstitious as all religious women — although much 
good your religion seems to do you. And you 
have the same twisted logic as all women, clever 
as you are. You would drink yourself to death 
if I would let you, but you'd never commit the 
overt act. If you are relying on your jewels 
to bribe the servants with, you will not find 
them. They are in the safe at the Club. And 
I shall discontinue your allowance." 

"Very well. Please go. I should like to 
take my bath." 


He was obliged to attend an important consultation an hour later, but he did not lock the 
doors as he had threatened. He wanted as little 
scandal in the hotel as possible, and he believed 
her to be helpless without money. The bar- 
keeper was an old friend of his, and when he 
instructed him to honor no orders from his suite 
he knew, that the man's promise could be relied 
on. The chambermaid was dismissed. 

As soon as she was alone Madeleine wrote to 
her father and asked Km for a thousand dollars. 
It was the first time she had asked him for 
money since her marriage; and he sent it to her 
with a long kindly letter, warning her against 
extravagance. She had given no reason for her 
request, but he inferred that she had been 
running up bills and was afraid to tell her husband. Was she ill, that she wrote so seldom? 
He understood that she had quite recovered. 
But she must remember that he and her mother 
were old people. 

Several days after her return she had sold 
four new gowns, recently arrived from New 
York and xmwom, to Sibyl Forbes.

RALPH HOLT ran down the steps of a 
famous night restaurant in north Montgomery Street on the edge of Chinatown, It 
was a disreputable place but it had a certain 
air of brilliancy, although below the sidewalk, 
and was favored by men that worked late on 
newspapers, not only for its excellent cuisine but 
because there was likely to be some garish bit 
of drama to refresh the jaded mind. 

The large room was handsomely furnished 
with mahogany and lit by three large crystal 
chandeliers and many side bradcets. It was 
about two thirds full. A band was playing and 
on a platform a woman in a Spanish costume of 
sorts was dancing the can-can, to the noisy 
appreciation of the male guests. Along one
