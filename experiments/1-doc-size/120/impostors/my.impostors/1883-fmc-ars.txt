"It was quite right," said Nino. "He ought 



 

to know, of course. And what else did you tell 
him?" 

"Nothing especial, Nino mio. He went away in 
a sort of ill temper because I would not let him 
abuse you as much as he pleased." 

" He may abuse me and be welcome," said Nino. 
" He has some right to be angry with me. But he 
will think differently some day." 

So we chatted away for an hour, enjoying the 
rest and the peace and the sweet sunshine of the 
Easter afternoon. But this was the day of inter 
ruptions. There was one more visitor to come, 
one more scene for me to tell you, and then I have 
done. 

A carriage drove down the street and seemed to 
stop at the door of my house. Nino looked idly out 
of the window. Suddenly he started. 

" Hedwig, Hedwig ! " he cried, " here is your father 
coming back ! " 

She would not look out, but stood back from the 
window, turning pale. If there were one thing she 
dreaded, it was a meeting with her father. All the 
old doubt as to whether she had done right seemed 
to come back to her face in a moment. But Nino 
turned and looked at her, and his face was so triumphant that she got back her courage, and clasping 
his hand bravely awaited what was to come. 

I myself went to the door, and heard Lira's slow 
tread on the stairs. Before long he appeared, and 
glanced up at me from the steps, which he climbed, 
one at a time, with his stick. 

" Is my daughter here ? " he asked as soon as he 



 

reached me ; and his voice sounded subdued, just 
as Nino's did when Benoni had gone. 

I conducted him into the room. It was the 
strangest meeting. The proud old man bowed 
stiffly to Hedwig, as though he had never before 
seen her. Nino and Hedwig also bent their heads, 
and there was a silence as of death in the sunny 
room. 

"My daughter," said Von Lira at last, and with 
evident effort, "I wish to have a word with you. 
These two gentlemen the younger of whom is now, 
as I understand it, your husband may well hear 
what I wish to say." 

I moved a chair so that he might sit down, but he 
stood up to his full height, as though not deigning 
to be older than the rest. I watched Hedwig, and 
saw how with both hands she clung to Nino's arm, 
and her lip trembled, and her face wore the look it 
had when I saw her in Fillettino. 

As for Nino, his stern, square jaw was set, and his 
brows bent, but he showed no emotion, unless the 
darkness in his face and the heavy shadows beneath 
his eyes foretold ready anger. 

"I am no trained reasoner, like Signer Grandi," 
said Lira, looking straight at Hedwig, "but I can say 
plainly what I mean, for all that. There was a good 
old law in Sparta, whereby disobedient children were 
put to death without mercy. Sparta was a good 
country, very like Prussia, but less great. You 
know what I mean. You have cruelly disobeyed me, 
cruelly, I say, because you have shown me that 
all my pains and kindness and discipline have been 



 

in vain. There is nothing so sorrowful for a good 
parent as to discover that he has made a mistake." 

The canting old proser, I thought, will he never 
finish ! 

" The mistake I refer to is not in the way I have 
dealt with you," he went on, " for on that score I 
have nothing to reproach myself. But I was mis 
taken in supposing you loved me. You have de 
spised all I have done for you." 

" Oh, father ! How can you say that ? " cried poor 
Hedwig, clinging closer to Nino. 

"At all events, you have acted as though you did. 
On the very day when I promised you to take signal 
action upon Baron Benoni, you left me by stealth, 
saying in your miserable letter that you had gone to 
a man who could both love and protect you." 

"You did neither the one nor the other, sir," said 
Nino boldly, "when you required of your daughter 
to marry such a man as Benoni." 

"I have just seen Benoni; I saw him also on the 
night you left me, madam," he looked severely at 
Hedwig, " and I am reluctantly forced to confess
