Jeffries must be the person Mrs. Brundage spoke of, 
and also the old admirer of DoUy Allaire. She does 
not extend an invitation ; but she says suddenly to St. 
George, — 

"You must go?" 

Her air puzzles him. 

" I shall return at the earliest opportunity,— -perhaps 
to-morrow night." It is almost as if she needed his pro- 
tection. The half-alarmed, half-beseeching expression 
in her face is so new, that it moves him inexplicably. 
He has a mind to throw up his great bargain and 
remain. 

" Well," she says, rather nervously. 

Mr. Jeffries is standing near, so St. George takes out 
his card-case and writes a brief note and good-by to 
Dolly. 

"Will you be kind enough to give that to our friend?" 
be asks with his adieu. 



 



 



 

Christmas stands in a maze of confusion until DoUy 
comes flying down the stairs. 

"You never did let him go ! " she cries, angrily. " You 
did it just on purpose.'' 

"Study the train time and see how many moments he 
had to waste," is the quiet answer. 

"And the man, what was he like?" Dolly demands, 
imperiously; " The thing looks like a plan, an excuse to 
get away." 

Miss Ormiston smiles with a sense of amusement. 

"Do not be so childish, Dolly," she entreats. " Come 
and have some lunch, and as soon as it is cool, you shall 
drive about wherever you please. Mr. St. Greorge had 
urgent business, as you must know." 

" I wish there was no such thing," she cries, pettishly. 
" He doesn't need to sell pictures. It is mercenary in 
himl" 

However, the chocolate and the fruits restore Dolly to 
some extent ; she never has any appetite for solids. Mrs. 
Byrne offers some delicate, discriminating praise, and 
Christmas repeats u sentence of Mr. Donaldson's that 
sounds like approbation. Half of her ill-nature is due 
to the fact that she has not Mr. St. Greorge's generous 
encomiums. 

"There certainly was no one who did any better," she 
declares, triumphantly. " I shall drive over to Cliff House 
this afternoon, to get my share of the admiration." 

Christmas questions within herself what she had bettei 
do. This Mr. Jeffries is surely Dolly's old lover. If she 
could be kept from seeing him ; but a whole week, no, that 
is quite impossible. Mrs. Brundage knew of Dolly's en- 
gagement, however. If St. Greorge had not gone just at 
this crisis ! Indeed, it does suggest a plot ; but not within 
Dolly's meaning. 

What she would have done, Christmas does not know, 
for she has visitors ; and Dolly Allaire goes to Cliff House 




ftnd does not return until twilight has set in, and then alone 
and unjojous, her face smaller and more ghostlike than 
ever, and she goes straight to bed. At all events, Mrs. 
Stannard is the one to look after her sister, and she is on 
the spot. She certainly must know how far it is wise 
to trust Mr. JefEries. Christmas feels strangely tangled 
with these unseen chains that draw everybody nearer together, 
with peilu4pS| no separate vditioiu

VBOK OUT THS PAST. 

LnoHTOir St. Obobos has never pnnmed fame ; but 
fame has now persisted in holding out to him her olive 
crown. Now and then he has sold a picture ; a few times, 
while abroad, painted one to order. He has fine and ex- 
quisite ideals, and works for his own interest in art ; is 
perhaps too indifferent to praise. One of his beautiful 
Indian scenes  The Heart of the Himalayas — has been 
lent to the club parlor, where it has had many admirers, 
and several offers, met with the chilling announcement 
that it is not for sale. But a wealthy Califomian has been
