is mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it, 
for I think it is more honor to be held worthy to be 
a specter-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and 
Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl 
in some of the real kingdoms of this world.” 

The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who 
approached and was about to lay his hand upon the 
king’s shoulder, when Hendon said: 

“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand — he 
shall go peaceably; I am responsible for that. Lead 
on, we will follow.” 

The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; 
Miles and the king followed after, with the crowd at 
their heels. The king was indined to rebel; but 
Hendon said to him in a low voice: 

“Reflect, sire — your laws are the wholesome 
breath of your own royalty; shall their source resist 
them, yet require the branches to respect them? 
Apparently, one of these laws has been broken; 
when the king is on his throne again, can it ever 
grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly 
a private person he loyally sunk the king in the 
citizen and submitted to its authority?” 

“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see 
that whatsoever the king of England requires a 
subject to suffer under the law, he will himself suffer 
while he holdeth the station of a subject,” 

When the woman was called upon to testify before 
the justice of the peace, she swore that the small 
prisoner at the bar was the person who had 
committed the theft; there was none able to show the 
contrary, so the king stood convicted. The bundle 
was now unrolled, and when the contents proved to 
be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked 
troubled, while Hendon turned pale, and his body 
was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but 
the king remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance.
The judge meditated, dtrring an ominous 
pause, then turned to the woman, with the question: 

“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?” 

The woman courtesied and replied: 

“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship — 
I could not abate a penny and set forth the value 
honestly.” 

The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon 
the crowd, then nodded to the constable and said: 

“Clear the court and close the doors.” 
 

It was done. None remained but the two officials, 
the accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon. This 
latter was rigid and colorless, and on his forehead 
big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended 
together, and triclded down his face. The judge 
turned to the woman again, and said, in a compas'' 
sionate voice: 

“’Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven 
hard by hunger, for these be grievous times for the 
unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an evil face — 
but when htmger driveth — Good woman! dost 
know that when one steals a thing above the value 
of thirteen pence ha’penny the law saith he shall 
hang for it?” 

The little king started, wide-eyed with consternation,
but controlled himself and held his peace; but 
not so the woman. She sprang to her feet, shaking 
with fright, and cried out: 

“Oh, good lack, what have I done! God-a-mercy, 
I would not hang the poor thing for the 
whole world! Ah, save me from this, your worship — 
what shall I do, what can I do?” 

The justice maintained his judicial composure, and 
simply said: 

“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, 
since it is not yet writ upon the record.” 

“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and 
heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of 
this awesome thing!” 

Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; 
and surprised the king and wounded his dignity by 
throwing his arms around him and hugging him. 

The woman made her grateftJ adieux and started 
away with her pig; and when the constable opened 
the door for her, he followed her out into the narrow 
hall. The justice proceeded to write in his record- 
book. Hendon, always alert, thought he would 
like to know why the officer followed the woman out; 
so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened. 
He heard a conversation to this effect: 

“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will 
buy it of thee; here is the eightpence.” 

“Eightpence, indeed! Thou’lt do no such thing. 
It cost me three shillings and eightpence, good 
honest coin of the last reign, that old Harry that’s 
just dead ne’er touched nor tampered with, A fig 
for thy eightpence!” 

“Stands the wind in that quarter? Thou wast 
under oath, and so swore falsely when thou saidst
