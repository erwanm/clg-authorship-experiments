Wales. 

It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was 
unaccountable — so all said that heard it. The tide 
was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty’s hopes to 
run high, when the Lord Protector ook his head 
and said: 

“It is true it is most wonderful — but it is no 
more than our lord the king likewise can do.” This 
remark, and this reference to himself as still the 
king, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes 
crumbling from under him. “These are not proof s,'' 
added the Protector. 

The tide was turning very fast now, very fast, 
indeed — but in the wrong direction; it was leaving 
poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne, and sweeping 
the other out to sea. The Lord Protector communed 
with himself — shook his head — the thought 
forced itself upon him, “It is perilous to the state 
and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as this; 
it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.”. 
He turned and said: 

“Sir Thomas, arrest this — No, hold!” His 
face lighted, and he confronted the ragged candi- 
date with this question: 

“Where lieth the Great Seal? Answer me this 
truly, and the riddle is unriddled; for only he that 
was Prince of Wales can so answer! On so trivial a 
thing hang a throne and a dynasty!” 

It was a lucky thought, a bappy thought. That 
it was so considered by the great officials was
manifested by the silent applause that shot from eye to 
eye around their circle in the form of bright 
approving glances. Yes, none but the true prince 
could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished 
Great Seal — this forlorn little impostor had been 
taught his lesson well, but here his teachings must 
fail, for his teacher himself could not answer that 
question — ah, very good, very good indeed: now we 
shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business 
in short order! And so they nodded invisibly and 
smiled inwardly with satisfaction, and looked to see 
this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty 
confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see 
nothing of the sort happen — how they marveled to 
hear him answer up promptly, in a confident and 
untroubled voice, and say: 

“There is naught in this riddle that is difficult.” 
Then, without so much as a by-your-leave to 
anybody, he turned and gave this command, with the 
easy manner of one accustomed to doing such 
things: “My Lord St, John, go you to my private 
cabinet in the palace — for none knoweth the place 
better than you — and, close down to the floor, in 
the left comer remotest from the door that opens 
from the antechamber, you shall find in the wall a 
brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little jewel- 
closet will fly open which not even you do know of 
— no, nor any soul else in all the world but me 
and the tmsty artisan that did contrive it for me. 
The first thing that falleth tmder your eye will be 
the Great Seal — fetch it hither.” 

All the company wondered at this speech, and 
wondered still more to see the little mendicant pick 
out this peer without hesitancy or apparent fear of 
mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly 
convincing air of having known him all his life. The 
peer was almost surprised into obeying. He even 
made a movement as if to go, but quickly recovered 
his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a 
blush. Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply : 

“Why dost thou hesitate? Hast not heard the 
king’s command? Go!” 

The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance — and 
it was observed that it was a significantly cautious 
and non-committal one, it not being delivered at 
either of the kings, but at the neutral ground 
about half-way between the two — and took his 
leave. 

Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles 
of that official group which was slow, scarcely 
perceptible, and yet steady and persistent — a move- 
ment such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is 
turned slowly, whereby the components of one 
splendid cluster fall away and join themselves to 
another — a movement which, little by little, in the 
present case, dissolved the glittering crowd that 
stood about Tom Canty and clustered it together 
again in the neighborhood of the new-comer. Tom 
Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief 
season of deep suspense and waiting — during which 
even the few faint-hearts still remaining near Tom 
Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to 
glide, one by one, over to the majority. So at last 
Tom Canty, in his royal robes and jewels, stood 
wholly alone and isolated from the world, a con- 
icuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy. 

Now the Lord St. John was seen returning. As 
he advanced up the mid-aisle the interest was so 
intense that the low murmur of conversation in the 
great assemblage died out and was succeeded by a 
profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which 
his footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound. 
Every eye was fastened upon him as he moved 
along. He reached the platform, paused a moment, 

then, moved toward Tom Canty with a deep 
obeisance, and said:
