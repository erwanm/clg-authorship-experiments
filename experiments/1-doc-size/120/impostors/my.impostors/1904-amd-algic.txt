We let father go home, and we took a walk about 
old Fort Dearborn, and talked western history, which 
interested him very much, as he had only the vaguest 
idea about the West. In spite of last evening, I had a 
light-hearted feeling, as if I was the Little Girl of the 
past going about with Norman. 

On our homeward way, just as I attempted to cross 
the street, a carriage halted. There were two women 
in it, and one leaned out calling to me laughingly 
"Ruth Gaynor Ruth Hayne!" 

I drew a long breath of utter amazement, and simply 
stared. But for thin, pale Mrs. Morrison I certainly 
should not have recognized Polly. She was a hand 
some woman and dressed in the richest manner. She 
seemed all of a glitter from her shining, rippling hair, 
the bronze feathers blowing about her hat, the cloud of 
lace around her neck with gold threads in it, and the 
glistening silk gown. On her one bare hand shone a 
circlet of diamonds, on her wrist a bracelet. 

"Oh," I ejaculated, drawing in a long breath of 
surprise. 



 

"If you had met me in a pudding pot you wouldn't 
have known me," and she laughed with an amused 
gayety. "You might get stirred up in the mush, but I 
wouldn't, I'm too large." 

"Polly Morrison," was all I could say. 

"I came yesterday afternoon. This is my first visit 
home, though I've trotted up and down the Missis 
sippi until I know every turn and every town. I have 
a husband who hardly lets me out of his sight and he 
has never found it convenient to come to Chicago. 
Perhaps he is afraid he might see some other woman 
he would like for a wife, he had such astonishing luck 
before. And how Chicago has changed! All the old 
houses have been built on to, and the stores and ware 
houses! It can't hold a candle to New Orleans, and 
Kaskaskia is a gay old town, but you're coming on. 
Is this Chris?" 

"No," and I explained. 

"We're just out for a flyer. I took mother along 
so that people would be the more likely to recognize 
me. This afternoon we must go calling. I suppose I 
ought to stay at home and let the neighbors call on me, 
but I want to see them so. And poor Mrs. Hayne is a 
widow. Ben gone off to college, is it? Homer get 
ting rich and peopling the town, but the other one is 
abroad married to some French marquise, I suppose, 
and Chris going to be a minister. Lots of other 
changes. There! You may look to see me some 
day." 

Her talk had been a swift dazzle, and made you feel 
as if some one had whirled you around. 





"What a talker," said John. "And what a handsome 
woman. She looks fit to be a queen !" 

We hurried home. I was anxious to have the dinner 
all right, and I didn't exactly want Dan to see me com 
ing home with young John Gaynor. Why, I could not 
explain altogether to myself. 

Jolette was just dishing up when Dan entered. He 
should not accuse me of secrecy this time. 

"Oh, Dan," I cried, "did you see the new arrival, 
not exactly in a coach and four, but in Harman's 
barouche? Madame Maseurier and her mother view 
ing the town." 

"Polly Morrison!" he ejaculated. "How does she 
look?" He was all interest. 

"John thinks like a queen. She is wonderfully hand 
some, or else it is the fine clothes." 

"Come to show them off, I suppose. The old French 
man with her?" 

"No. But she said her husband hardly let her out 
of his sight." 

"I'd trust Polly for squeezing out some dark night 
if she wanted to." Then he gave his old, merry laugh, 
and a good-humored nod. 

The dinner passed pleasantly. John had a good deal 
to say about the town. 

Dan's strictures rankled in my mind. I really 
wanted young John to live with us. I liked him so 
much already, as one might regard a young brother, 
indeed as I did Chris, only John belonged to me, to 
father. But I did not want any trouble or jeal 
ousy. 



 

The lad went down to the office the next morning, 
taking some lunch. Dan did not ask about him. He 
came home very enthusiastic. He had struck just the
