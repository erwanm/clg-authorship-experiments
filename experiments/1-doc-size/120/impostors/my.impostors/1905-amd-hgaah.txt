asked no love. What a curious sort of patch- 
work life seemed, her life at least. Would there 
be a nice tranquil year now, a delightful year of 
study ? She was really longing to get back to it. 

And it came in sight presently, the pretty lit- 
tle station with a bed of asters in bloom and sev- 
eral of the girls who had walked down to see if 
any new girl had arrived. 

"Oh, Helen Grant !*' and Marcia Hyde caught 
both hands, though one held a satchel. "I was 
afraid some unlooked-for episode had crossed 
your path like a tornado and swept you away. 
Such queer things happen to you ! I've been here 
since noon. Howd'do Miss Craven ? And we are 
all changed over on the other side, the graduating 
corridor. And I have the room next to yours. 
And yours opens into Miss Craven's. I suppose 
you are still Damon and Pythias, or wasn't there 
some wonderful woman friendship ? There ought 
to be. Women are as good as men." 

"Are there any new scholars?" 

"Four who have come for a post-graduate 
course from a school whose diploma doesn't ad- 

It's very funny," and Miss Hyde laughed heart- 
ily. 

"Rival in what?" 



"Well — friendship. You're not so dissimilar. 
Why, Helen, it seems queer, but you were a lit- 
tle girl when you first came here, and I thought 
Miss Craven so tall. You have almost caught 
up to her." 

"Little girls are born with the faculty of grow- 
ing," Helen remarked dryly. 

"And these other girls — they come from the 
same town. Miss Kent is tall and thin, stiff as 
a pound of starch and severe enough for a Puri- 
tan grandmother. Miss Logan isn't very tall, 
plump and round and rosy and looks as if she 
might be full of fun. They really wanted your 
room." 

"It was very good of Mrs. Aldred," said Miss 
Craven in a heartfelt tone. 

"The others haven't been introduced yet. They 
came in the other train. My ! What a class we 
shall have I They will not all go to college. Are 
you sure to?" 

"That is my resolve," returned Helen de- 
cisively. 

"Now, I feel queer about it. Father doesn't 
believe in it for a woman. Mother believes it 
gives you a position. I think college girls have 
lots of fun, and the commencements are splendid!
I might go for two years, but four takes so 
much out of your life." 

They had reached the familiar place. Mrs. Al- 
dred stood on the wide porch. Helen made a 
quick step and clasped her hand. 

"You can't think how glad I am to come back," 
she said with breathless delight. 

"The highest compliment you can pay me," was 
the rejoinder. 'I hope both of you girls have 
had a happy vacation?" 

She looked so earnest, so interested, and the 
charm about her appealed to both girls, though 
in a different manner. It is not so much what 
others give us as our receptivity, and how we 
can make the best of what is proffered. 

"It was delightful to me," returned Helen. "I 
have been living alongside of the grand old ocean, 
and sometimes dreaming over the wonderful 
changes it had seen. How did the first frail boats 
have the courage to cross it?" 

"I have often wondered at the bravery of those 
pioneer women. Yet now we go round the world 
with less fear, I hope you have brought plenty 
of vigor and energy for the year's work. I want 
it to be a fine year for you graduates, though I 
will say I shall be sorry to part from you. I 
realized last year how girls grow into my heart. 




You will find some changes, but I l)ave kept 
you two friends together. And you will meet 
several new ones." 

"Thank you for the consideration," and Helen 
smiled cordially. 

Their belongings had been taken to the new 
apartment. The doorway was wide and hung 
with a portiere, but the window looked toward 
the rising sun, the depression of the river and the 
crest of the hills opposite. 

"I almost feel as if I was in a strange place," 
Helen said. "There was a wider outlook on the
