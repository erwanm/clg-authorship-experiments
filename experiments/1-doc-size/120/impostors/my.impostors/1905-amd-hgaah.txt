young man doesn't come along and spoil it all/* 
said Annie in a half tone of amusement. 

"Will that spoil her life?" 

"Why, no; if she likes the career better she 
will keep to that. A girl isn't compelled to be 
married now-a-days to have a position. But I 
think I like the home better. I could have gone 
to college, but I believe Elsie has as nice a time 
as if she had ten degrees to her name. And her 
lover is splendid!" 

"Don't loiter so," exclaimed Miss Travis. "You 
young men can stroll along the beach and talk 
afterward. We mean business." 

Mr. Seton was watching for them. Over the 
store was a kind of hall, often used for storage 
as well as any public meeting that might be called. 
Now and then the young people held a dance on 
a notable birthday. He ushered them up the 
stairs and then explained how he would arrange 
the stage, put up a curtain, and the rest of the 
space would be filled with seats. 

"We must have some dressing rooms curtained 
off at the side," said Miss Travis. "And, oh, we 
ought to have an orchestra." 

They all looked at each other in dismay. 

"Why, yes," declared Jim. "Then the audience 
will not mind the waits so much." 




'Well â€” there's the Balem band. I guess they 
will be glad enough to come/' said Mr. Seton. 
"You see, I never fixed up a theatre before, so I'd 
rather you'd lay it out." 

They planned it very nicely and drew it on 
a paper so that nothing would be forgotten. 

"You are very good to take so much trouble," 
Miss Travis said. 

Mr. Seton gave a chuckle. "Well, it's for our- 
selves, you see, or rather for Widow Kean. Pity 
if we couldn't take trouble for some one we've 
known from a little gal. And Joe Kean was a 
first-rate fellow. 'Twas an awful shame he should 
die so young. And the goodness seems mostly on 
your part. My I how everybody will enjoy it, be- 
side the money. You see folks about here, the 
real old settlers I mean, don't often get to the 
big towns and see plays. You won't mind if we 
have a crowd?" 

"Oh, no. It would be rather mortifying to play 
to empty seats," returned Miss Travis. 

Mr. Seton laughed and gave a confident nod, 
wrinkling up his nose and half shutting his eyes. 
They had a little walk along the shore afterward. 
The air was crystal clear this morning and the 
sands seemed alight with gold. 

"Now you young men must look up your own

amusement I must have Miss Grant the rest 
of the morning, and Annie, there are several 
things mother wishes you to do, so you had bet- 
ter come with us," said Miss Travis. 

Annie turned reluctantly. She was to have a 
minor part in the play but knew her lines. 

There were two girl guests beside, who were 
much interested. It was a bright little society 
play with a misunderstanding between the lovers, 
and the friend's efforts to explain led to some 
rather laughable complications. Helen had the 
part of the friend. 

"It is rather hard to ask you to do so much," 
said Miss Travis. "But you have such a quick 
memory." 

"Oh, I am truly glad to help you in any way," 
Helen returned in her heartsome manner. 

They read it over and Miss Travis made sev- 
eral explanations. Then luncheon was an- 
nounced. The guests and the children were all at 
the table and Helen enjoyed it extremely. But she 
insisted afterward that she must return home and 
devote herself to business. 

"We will come down in the evening to see how 
you get along and to hear your friend, Miss Cra- 
ven, play. IVe been telling Mr. Danforth about 
her."
