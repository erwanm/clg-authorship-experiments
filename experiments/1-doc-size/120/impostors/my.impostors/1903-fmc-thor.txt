What Sabina had foreseen had happened. Her 
mother had looked her over, from head to foot, to see 
what sort of condition she was in, as a horse-dealer 
looks oyer a promising colt he has not seen for some 
time ; and the Princess had instantly detected the signs 
of an accident. In answer to her question Sabina told 
the truth. Her mother had watched her face and her 
innocent eyes while she was telling the story, and 
needed no other confirmation. 

" You are a good girl," she continued, as Sabina did 
not reply to the last speech. "But you are a little 
fool. I wonder why my children are all idiots ! I 
am not so stupid after all. I suppose it must have 
been your poor father." 

The white lids closed thoughtfully over her magnifi- 
cent eyes, and opened again after a moment, as if she 
had called up a vision of her departed husband and 
had sent it away again. 

" I suppose it was silly of me to go at all," Sabina 





 

admitted, leaning back in her cliair. " But I wanted 
so much to see the statues ! " 

She felt at home. Her mother had brcught her up 
badly and foolishly, and of late had neglected her 
shamefully. Sabina knew that and neither loved her 
nor respected her, and it was not because she was 
her mother that the girl felt suddenly at ease in her 
presence, as she never could feel with the Baroness. She 
did not wish to be at all like her mother in character, 
or even in manner, and yet she felt that they belonged 
to the same kind, spoke the same language, and had an 
instinctive understanding of each other, though these 
things implied neither mutual respect nor affection. 

"That horrible old Volterra! " said the Princess, 
with emphasis. " He means to keep everything he has 
found, for himself, if he can. I have come only just in 
time." 

Sabina did not answer. She knew nothing of the 
law, and though she fancied that she might have some 
morally just claim to a share in the treasure, she had 
never believed that it could be proved. 

" Of course," the Princess continued, smoking 
thoughtfully, "there is only one thing to be done. 
You must marry this Malipieri at once, whether you 
like him or not. What sort of man is he ? " 

The faint colour rose in Sabina's cheeks and not al- 
together at the mere thought of marrying Malipieri; 
she was hurt by the way her mother spoke of him. 

" What kind of man is he ? " the Princess repeated. 
"I suppose he is a Venetian, a son of the man who 





married the Gradenigo heiress, about the time when I 
was married myself. Is he the man who discovered 
Troy ? " 

" Carthagj, I think," said Sabina. 

"Troy, Carthage, America, it is all the same. He 
discovered something, and I fancy he will be rich. 
But what is he like ? Dark, fair, good, bad, snuffy or 
smart ? As he is an archaeologist, he must be snuffy, 
a bore, probably, and what the English call a male 
frump. It cannot be helped, my dear ! You will 
have to marry him. Describe him to me." 

" He is dark," said Sabina. 

" I am glad of that. I always liked dark men — 
your father was fair, like you. Besides, as you are 
a blonde, you will always look better beside a dark 
husband. But of course he is dreadfully careless, with 
long hair and doubtful nails. All those people are." 

" No," said Sabina. " He is very nice-looking and 
neat, and wears good clothes." 

The Princess's brow cleared. 

"All the better," she said. "Well, my dear, it is 
not so bad after all. We have found a husband for 
you, rich, of good family — quite as good as yours, 
my child ! Good-looking, smart — what more do you 
expect? Besides, he cannot possibly refuse to marry 
you after what has happened. On the whole, I think 
your adventure has turned out rather well. You can 
be married in a month. Every one will think it quite 
natural that it should have been kept quiet until I 
came, you see." 



 

" But even if I wanted to marry him, he will never 
ask for me," objected Sabina, who was less surprised 
than might be expected, for she knew her mother 
thoroughly. 

The Princess laughed, and blew a cloud of smoke 
from her lips, and then showed her handsome teeth.
