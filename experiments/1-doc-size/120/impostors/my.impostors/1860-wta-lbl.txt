the Flyaway since her departure from Portsmouth 



 

harbor. Tom and the other mutineers expressed 
feheir sorrow for what they had done, and were 
ready to submit to such punishment as the cap- 
tain thought it necessary to inflict upon them. 
But Paul told him how penitent they had been, 
that Tom had promised to reform his life, and he 
thought they had already been severely punished 
for their misconduct by the terrors of the long 
and anxious night they had passed through. This 
he proved by showing that all of them had re- 
fused to follow Frank's plan of continuing the 
cruise. 

"But they punished you more than they pun- 
ished themselves, by keeping you on deck all 
night," said Captain Littleton. 

" It was not punishment to me, for I was inno- 
cent, and they were guilty," replied Paul. 

" You are right, my boy ; it is guilt that makes 
us cowards in the midst of peril. You plead so 
strongly for them, Paul, that I shall forgive all 
except Frank. He must be a passenger in that 
fishing schooner, which is bound for Boston. When 



 

I arrived at Portsmouth this morning, I learned 
from Captain Gordon that the boys had run away 
with the yacht. I supposed, of course, you had 
wrecked her in the gale and the fog, and I chartered 
that vessel, which was on the point of sailing for 
Boston, to go in search of you. I thank God 
you are all safe." 

Frank Thompson, in spite of his earnest protest, 
was put on board the schooner, and the Flyaway's 
head was turned to the north. Captains Gordon 
and Briskett resumed their places, and Henry Lit- 
tleton spent the whole afternoon in listening to 
Paul's animated narrative of the cruise of the 
yacht to seaward. 

In the course of the night the Flyaway reached 
Portland. But we have not space to detail the ad- 
ventures of the Teneans in the harbor, or to give 
the particulars of the race between them and the 
North Star Boat Club. On the following Satur- 
day night the Flyaway arrived at Bayville, and 
Mrs. Duncan once more pressed to her heart her 
darling boys. 



 



CHAPTER XXI. 

PAUL ADVANCES LITTLE BY LITTLE, AND THE 
STORY ENDS. 

Fob several years Paul pursued his calling as a 
fisherman; and as he grew older the business be- 
came more profitable. Before he was twenty-one, 
the mortgage on the house was paid off; and when 
he was free he had saved up quite a handsome sum 
of money, with which he purposed to extend his 
operations. But when he was on the point of 
purchasing a schooner of sixty tons, a situation as 
second mate of an ocean steamer was offered to him, 
with the promise of certain advancement as he 
became qualified to fill more important positions. 
He concluded, after mature deliberation, to accept 
the offer, and the fishing business was entirely given 
up to John, who continued it for several years, with 
good success. 



 

If my young reader's imagination is vivid enough 
to accomplish the feat, let us step forward nine 
years, which will very nearly bring our story up to 
the present time. It is easy to jump over a long 
period of years in this manner on paper, but not so 
easy for the mind to realize the number and the im- 
portance of the events which may transpire in this 
time. Though we step forward over long years of 
toil and care, of joy and sorrow, of severe trial and 
patient waiting, and behold the Paul Duncan of 
to-day, it will be hard to believe he is not still a 
boy, and the skipper of the Fawn, as we have seen 
him in the pages of our story. 

He is no longer a boy, and we can scarcely be- 
lieve that he with the bushy whiskers, and the 
strong, well-knit frame, is the young navigator of 
our tale. Yet it is he ; and in order that our young 
friends may be properly introduced to him, we will 
step back a day. 

Ah, you don't recognize Bayville ; you don't feel 
at home there ; for every thing is changed since 
the young fisherman sold his wares in its streets. 

Where is the cottage of Mrs. Duncan, do you
