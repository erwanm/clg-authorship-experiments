do the rest." 

"I know what the Doctor will do." Tony 
was silent a moment. "What will you do?" 

Dennis faltered, but at last he spoke. " Every 
thing but marry her." 

A flare of admiration rose and fell in Tony's 
eyes. " You're beyond me ! " 

"I don't in the least know where I am, save 
that I'm in a black, bloody nightmare. It's not 
I, it's not she, it's not you, it's not anyone. I 
shall wake up at last, I suppose, but mean 
while " 

" There's plenty more to come ? Oh, as much 
as you like ! " Tony excitedly declared. 

" For me, but not for you. For you the worst's 
over," his companion boldly observed. 





"Over? with all my life made hideous?" 

There was a certain sturdiness in Vidal's mo 
mentary silence. " You think so now ! " 

Then he added more gently : " I grant you it's 
hideous enough." 

Tony stood there in the agony of the actual; 
the tears welled into his hot eyes. "She butch 
ered she tortured my child. And she did it 
to incriminate Jean." 

He brought it all back to Dennis, who exclaimed 
with simple solemnity : " The dear little girl 
the sweet, kind little girl ! " With a sudden 
impulse that in the midst of this tenderness 
seemed almost savage, he laid on Tony's shoul 
der a hard, conscientious hand. " She forced 
her in. She held her down. She left her." 

The men turned paler as they looked at each 
other. " I'm infamous I'm infamous," said Tony. 

There was a long pause that was like a strange 
assent from Dennis, who at last, however, brought 
out in a different tone : " It was her passion." 

" It was her passion." 

" She loves you ! " Dennis went on with 

a drop, before the real, of all vain terms. 

" She loves me ! " Tony's face reflected the 
mere monstrous fact. "It has made what it has 





made her awful act and my silence. My silence 
is a part of the crime and the cruelty I shall 
live to be a horror to myself. But I see it, none 
the less, as I see it, and I shall keep the word 
I gave her in the first madness of my fear. It 
came to me. There it is." 

" I know what came to you," Dennis said. 

Tony wondered. " Then you've seen her ? " 

Dennis hesitated. " I know it from the 
Doctor." 

"I see " Tony thought a moment. "She, 

I imagine " 

" Will keep it to herself ? Leave that to me ! " 
Dennis put out his hand again. "Good-bye." 

" You take her away ? " 

" To-night." 

Tony kept his hand. "Will her flight help 
Ramage ? " 

" Everything falls in. Three hours ago I came 
for her." 

"So it will seem prearranged?" 

"For the event she announced to you. Our 
happy union ! " said Dennis Vidal. 

He reached the door to the hall, where Tony 
checked him. " There's nothing, then, I shall 
do for you ? " 





"It's done. We've helped each other." 

What was deepest in Tony stirred again. "I 
mean when your trouble has passed." 

" It will never pass. Think of that when 
you're happy yourself."
