lives of others, no matter how painful. It was this 
pride, this pleasure, which Beaton now felt in realis- 
ing that the toils of fate were about him, that 
between him and a future of which Christine Dry- 
foos must be the genius, there was nothing but the 
will, the mood, the fancy of a girl who had not 
given him the hope that either could ever again be 
in his favour. He had nothing to trust to, in fact, 
but his knowledge that he had once had them all ; 
she did not deny that ; but neither did she conceal 
that he had flung away his power over them, and 
she had told him that they never could be his again. 
A man knows that he can love and wholly cease to 
love, not once merely, but several times ; he recog- 
nises the fact in regard to himself, both theoretically 
and practically ; but in regard to women he cherishes 
the superstition of the romances that love is once 
for all, and for ever. It was because Beaton would 
not believe that Alma Leighton, being a woman, 
could put him out of her heart after suffering him 



  

to steal into it, that he now liopcd anything from 
her, and she had been so explicit when they hist 
spoke of that affair that he did not hope much. 
He said to himself that he was going to cast him- 
self on her mercy, to take whatever chance of 
life, love, and work there was in her having the 
smallest pity on him. If she would liavc none, 
then there was but one thing he couW do : marry 
Christine and go abroad. He did not see how he 
could bring this alternative to bear upon Alma ; 
even if she knew what he would do in case of a 
final rejection, he had grounds for fearing she would 
not care ; but he brought it to bear upon himself, 
and it nerved him to a desperate courage. He 
could hardly wait for evening to come, before he 
went to see her; when it came, it seemed to have 
come too soon. He had wrought himself thoroughly 
into the conviction that he was in earnest, and that 
everything depended upon her answer to him, but 
it was not till he found himself in her presence, and 
alone with her, that he realised the truth of his 
conviction. Then the influences of her grace, her 
gaict}', her arch beauty, above all, her good sense, 
penetrated his soul like a subtle intoxication, and he 
said to himself that he was right; he could not 
live without her ; these attributes of hers were what 
he needed to win him, to cheer him, to charm him, 
to guide him. He longed so to please her, to in- 
gratiate himself with her, that he attempted to be 
light like her in his talk, but lapsed into abysmal 
absnnres, and gloomy recesses of introspection. 



  

" What are you laughing at ? " he asked, suddenly 
starting from one of these. 

"What you are thinking of." 

" It 's notliing to laugh at. Do you know what it 
is I 'm thinking of ? " 

•' Don't tell, if it 's dreadful." 

"Oh, I dare say you wouldn't think it 's dreadful," 
he said, with bitterness. " It 's simply the case of a 
man who has made a fool of himself, and sees no 
help of retrieval in himself." 

" Can any one else help a man unmake a fool of 
himself ? " she asked, with a smile. 

"Yes. In a case like this." 

" Dear me ! This is very interesting." 

She did not ask him what the case was, but he 
was launched now, and he pressed on. " I am the 
man who has made a fool of himself " 

"Oh!" 

"And you can help me out if you will. Alma, I 
wish you could see me as I really am." 

"Do you, Mr. Beaton ? Perhaps I do." 

"Xo; you don't. You formulated me in a cer- 
tain way, and you won't allow for the change that 
takes place in every one. You have changed ; why 
shouldn't I ? " 

"Has this to do with your having made a fool of 
yourself ? " 

" Yes." 

" Oh ! Then I don't see how you have changed." 

She laughed, and he too, ruefully. " You 're cruel. 
Not but what I deserve your mockery. But the 



  

change was not from the capacity of making a fool 
of myself. I suppose I shall always do that more 
or less — unless you help me. Alma ! Why can't 
you have a little compassion ? You know that I 
must always love you." 

" Nothing makes me doubt that like your saying it,
