" Yes. I have forgotten," said Maria closing her eyes. 

" O Maria, please do get up ! I'm almost 
dressed ; and I can't do the whole, you know. 
Won't you get up ? " 

What's the matter, Tilly ? " said her sis- 
ter, rolling over, and opening her eyes quietly 
at Matilda. 

" I am going down, Maria, in two minutes ; 
and I cannot do everything, you know." 

"Clarissa'll help." 

" If you expect that, Maria, you will be disappointed. I wish you would come right 
down and make the fire." 

Maria lay still. Matilda finished her dressing, and then knelt down by the window. 

The burden upon her seemed rather heavy, 
and she went to her only source of help. 
Maria lay and looked at the little kneeling 
figure, so still there by the window ; glanced 
at the growing light outside the window, then 
at her scattered articles of clothing, lying 
where she had thrown them or dropped them 
last night ; and at last rolled herself out of 
bed and was dressing in earnest when Matilda 
rose up to go downstairs. 

" O now you'll soon be ready ! " she exclaimed. " Make haste, Maria ; and come 
down to the kitchen. The fire is the first 
thing." 

Then the little feet went with a light tread 
down the stairs, that she might disturb nobody, and paused in the hall. The light 
struggling in through the fanlights over the 
door ; the air close ; a smell of kerosene in the 




parlour; chairs and table in a state of disarrangement ; the litter of Clarissa's work on 
the carpet ; the parlour stove cold. Little 
Matilda wished to herself that some other 
hands were there, not hers, to do all that must 
be done. But clearly Maria would never get 
through with it. She stood looking a minute ; 
then plunged into the work. She opened the 
shutters and the curtains, and threw up the 
windows. Then picked up the litter. Then 
she saw that the services of a broom were 
needed ; and Matilda fetched the broom and 
brushed out the parlour and the hall. It tired 
her arms ; she was not used to it. Dusting 
the furniture was more in her line ; and then 
Matilda came to the conclusion that if a fire 
was to be kindled in time this morning, it 
must be done by herself; Maria would be 
fully occupied in the kitchen. So downstairs 
she went for billets of wood for kindling. 
There was Maria, in trouble. 

" This stove won't draw, Tilly." 

What is the matter ? " 




Why that. It won't draw. It just 
smokes." 

" It always does draw, Maria." 

" Well, it won't to-day." 

" Did you put kindling enough in ? " 

" There's nothing but kindling! and 
smoke." 

" Why, you've got the damper turned," said 
Matilda, coming up to look ; " see, that's the 
matter. It won't light with the damper 
turned." 

" Stupid ! " Maria muttered ; and Matilda 
went off to make her own fire. Happily 
that did not smoke. The parlour and hall 
were all in nice order ; the books put in place, 
and everything ready for the comfort of people when they should come to enjoy it; and 
Matilda went to join her sister in the kitchen. 
The fire was going there too, and the kitchen 
warm, and Maria stood with her hands folded, 
in front of the stove. 

" I don't know what to get for breakfast," 
she said. 




" Is the other room ready ? " 

" T set the table," said Maria; " but what 
is to go on it, I don't know." 

Matilda went in to look at the state of 
things ; presently called her sister. 

" Maria, you didn't sweep the carpet." 

" No. Of course I didn't. Rooms don't 
want to be swept every day." 

" This one does. Look at the muss under 
the table."
