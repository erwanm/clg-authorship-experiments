can’t we get up a whist club and meet round 
at each other’s houses? You see it wouldn’t be 
possible to get up any sort of school thing, un- 


 

less there was some study motive in it. Good- 
ness, we have enough of that! ” 

“ Why, that’s just splendid! We can have 
two tables, — eight, four of us and four boys. 
We’ll give it a pretty name and keep it select. 
Now, who shall we choose for the fourth?” 

“ We could take in one Henderson. Oh ! 
don’t you think that niece kind of queer ? She 
acts as if she was afraid of everybody.” 

“ She was in some pension abroad. Her 
father died and she had to come here. Don’t 
you suppose she’s dependent on them, a sort of 
poor relation? And isn’t a pension a kind of 
charity school ? ” 

“ I rather think it is. And she dresses so 
plainly, not a bit of style to her.” 

“ Well, they’re very good to her then.” 

“ And there’s that Honor Bain. You see 
there would be enough outside girls, but we 
want to keep it a sort of school thing and not 
take in any of the small fry.” 

“ And we’ll have Dick and Carl Benson. 
Oh, yes, and Larry.” 

“ And Henderson. Dick will be around to- 
night and I’ll get the thing settled with him. 




Dick’s having a first-class toboggan made. The 
coasting is just splendid!” 

After some consideration Althea sounded 
Meta Henderson. 

“ Oh, we do play some at home, but I do not 
think mother would consent to either of us 
joining an evening club,” she replied. 

“ But if your brother did? ” 

“ Oh, boys seem so different.” 

“ It is going to be very select. Just from the 
first families in town.” 

“ Mark likes the outdoors sports so much. 
And he is studying with all his might and 
main. He likes Miss Grant immensely.” 
Althea gave a supercilious nod and there 
was the slightest curl of the lip. 

“Don’t you like her?” Meta asked a little 
more timidly. 

“ Oh, she’s well enough for a teacher, I sup- 
pose,” and there was a touch of disrespect in 
the tone. “ Dick Eastman gives it to her now 
and then, and it’s quite fun.” 

“ But — about what? ” in a surprised tone. 

“ Oh, she puts on such a lot of airs. And 
she coddles up the little girls so. I suppose she 


 

really knows better how to teach them. But we 
who are up to her level in some things, and 
perhaps above it socially, know how to take 
her.” 

“ But Miss Jaynes has the smaller children, 
the younger classes, I should say. Father and 
Mark were at Mrs. Stirling’s, where she 
boards, the other evening. And father thinks 
her very capable. She’s away up in chemistry 
and that’s one of the things Mark wants. He 
means to be a professor of chemistry when he 
gets through college. And he’s going to begin 
Greek with her.” 

There was a toss of the head and a curve of 
the lips that said plainly that Althea had not 
a very high opinion of the Greek Miss Grant 
could teach. 

“ Well,” she returned, “ I hope you will join 
the club. Meeting only on Friday evening it 
cannot distract us from our studies. And, as 
I said, we shall keep it very select and choose 
a pretty name, and just have congenial spirits. 
It’s so much more agreeable to have girls all of 
one mind.” 

Meta was flattered by the preference. Still 



she did not feel quite sure that she wanted 
to join. But if Mark did it would be pleasant. 

So she laid the case before her mother.
