The first effect of this was to awake and enlarge 
what philosophers would call her enthusiasm of 
humanity. The second effect was to show her 
and this was what this little dinner emphasized 
that she had put limitations upon herself and taken 
on unthought-of responsibilities. To put this sort 
of life one side, or make it secondary to her own 
idea of a useful and happy life, would have been 
easy but for one thing she loved Jack. This 
philosophic reasoning about it does her injustice. 
It did not occur to her that she could go her way 
and let him go his way. Nor must it be supposed 
that the problem seemed as grave to her as it real- 
ly was the danger of frittering away her own 
higher nature in faithfulness to one of the noblest 
impulses of that nature. Yet this is the way that 
so many trials of life come, and it is the greatest 
test of character. She felt as many women do 
feel that if she retained her husband's love all 
would be well, and the danger involved to herself 
probably did not cross her mind. 

But what did cross her mind was that these as- 
sociations meant only evil for Jack, and that to be 
absorbed in the sort of life that seemed to please 
him was for her to drift away from all her ideals. 

A confused notion of all this was in her thoughts 
when she talked with Father Damon, while the 







gentlemen were in the smoking -room. She asked 
him about his mission. 

"The interest continues," he replied ; " but your 
East Side, Mrs. Delancy, is a puzzling place." 

" How so ?" 

" Perhaps you'll laugh if I say there is too much 
intelligence." 

Edith did laugh, and then said: "Then you'd 
better move your mission over to this side. Here 
is a field of good, unadulterated worldliness. But 
what, exactly, do you mean ?" 

" Well, the attempt of science to solve the prob- 
lem of sin and wretchedness. What can you ex- 
pect when the people are socialists and their lead- 
ers agnostics ?" 

" But I thought you were something of a social- 
ist yourself !" 

" So I am," he said, frankly, " when I see the 
present injustice, the iniquitous laws and combina- 
tions that leave these people so little chance. They 
are ignorant, and expect the impossible ; but they 
are right in many things, and I go with them. But 
my motive is not theirs. I hope not. There is no 
hope except in a spiritual life. Materialism down 
at the bottom of society is no better than mate- 
rialism at the top. Do you know," he went on, 
with increased warmth, "that pessimism is rath- 
er the rule over that side, and that many of 
those who labor most among the poor have the 





least hope of ever making things substantially 
better P 

" But such unselfish people as Dr. Leigh do a 
great deal of good," Edith suggested. 

" Yes," he said, reflecting "yes, I have no doubt. 
I don't understand it. She is not hopeful. She sees 
nothing beyond. I don't know what keeps her up." 

" Love of humanity, perhaps." 

" I wish the phrase had never been invented. 
Religion of humanity ! The work is to save the 
souls of those people." 

" But," said Edith, with a flush of earnestness 
" but, Father Damon, isn't human love the greatest 
power to save P 

The priest looked at the girl. His face softened, 
and he said, more gently, " I don't know. Of the 
soul, yes. But human love is so apt to stand in the 
way of the higher life." 

In her soul Edith resented this as an ascetic and 
priestly view ; but she knew his devotion to that 
humanity which he in vain tried to eliminate from 
his austere life, and she turned the talk lightly by 
saying, "Ah, that is your theory. But I am com- 
ing over soon, and shall expect you and Dr. Leigh 
to take me about." 

The next morning Mr. Mavick's card gave him 
instant admission to the inner office of Mr. Hen- 
derson, the approach to whom was more carefully 
guarded than that to the President of the United 





States. This was not merely necessary to save him
