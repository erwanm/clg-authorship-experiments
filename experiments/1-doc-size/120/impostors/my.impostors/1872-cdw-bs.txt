 

is one woman in the world whose sweet presence 
would be compensation for the loss of all else. It 
is not to be reasoned about ; he wants that one ; 
it is her plume dancing down the sunny street 
that sets his heart beating ; he knows her form 
among a thousand, and follows her; he longs to 
run after her carriage, which the cruel coachman 
whirls out of his sight. It is marvellous to him 
that all the world does not want her too, and he 
is in a panic when he thinks of it. And what 
exquisite flattery is in that little word addressed 
to her, and with what sweet and meek triumph 
she repeats it to herself, with a feeling that is not 
altogether pity for those who still stand and wait. 
To be chosen out of all the available world it 
is almost as much bliss as it is to choose. "All 
that long, long stage-ride from Blim's to Portage 
I thought of you every moment, and wondered 
what you were doing and how you were looking 
just that moment, and I found the occupation so 
charming that I was almost sorry when the jour 
ney was ended." Not much in that ! But I have 
no doubt the Young Lady read it over and over, 
and dwelt also upon every moment, and found in 




it new proof of unshaken constancy, and had in 
that and the like things in the letter a sense of 
the sweetest communion. There is nothing in 
this letter that we need dwell on it, but I am 
convinced that the mail does not carry any other 
letters so valuable as this sort. 

I suppose that the appearance of Herbert in 
this new light unconsciously gave tone a little to 
the evening's talk ; not that anybody mentioned 
him, but Mandeville was evidently generalizing 
from the qualities that make one person admired 
by another to those that win the love of man 
kind. 

MANDEVILLE. There seems to be something 
in some persons that wins them liking, special or 
general, independent almost of what they do or 
say. 

THE MISTRESS. Why, everybody is liked by 
some one. 

MANDEVILLE. I 'm not sure of that. There 
are those who are friendless, and would be if 
they had endless acquaintances. But, to take 
the case away from ordinary examples, in which 
habit and a thousand circumstances influence 



 

liking, what is it that determines the world upon 
a personal regard for authors whom it has never 
seen ? 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Probably it is the spirit 
shown in their writings. 

THE MISTRESS. More likely it is a sort of tra 
dition ; I don't believe that the world has a feel 
ing of persona] regard for any author who was 
not loved by those who knew him most inti 
mately. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Which comes to the same 
thing. The qualities, the spirit, that got him the 
love of his acquaintances he put into his books. 

MANDEVILLE. That doesn't seem to me suf 
ficient. Shakespeare has put everything into 
his plays and poems, swept the whole range of 
human sympathies and passions, and at times is 
inspired by the sweetest spirit that ever man 
had. 

THE YOUNG LADY. No one has better inter 
preted love. 

MANDEVILLE. Yet I apprehend that no per 
son living has any personal regard for Shake 
speare, or that his personality affects many, 



 

except they stand in Stratford church and feel a 
sort of awe at the thought that the bones of the 
greatest poet are so near them. 

THE PARSON. I don't think the world cares 
personally for any mere man or woman dead for 
centuries. 

MANDEVILLE. But there is a difference. I 
think there is still gather a warm feeling for 
Socrates the man, independent of what he said, 
which is little known. Homer's works are cer 
tainly better known, but no one cares person 
ally for Homer any more than for any other 
shade. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. Why not go back to Moses ? 
We 've got the evening before us for digging up 
people. 

MANDEVILLE. Moses is a very good illustra
