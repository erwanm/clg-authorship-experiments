"No, it wasn't any such thing. It would have done very well for her to
put on as a change to-day and to-morrow."

"Well, ma'am, it's in the wash, and no help for it now," said Netty,
quite pertly.

I was dreadfully provoked with her, and had it on my tongue to order
her to leave my presence instantly. But I choked down my rising
indignation.

"Take the red and white one, then," said I.

"The sleeve's nearly torn off of that. There isn't any one that she can
wear except her white muslin."

"Oh dear! It's too bad! What shall I do? The children are all in rags
and tatters!"

And in this style I fretted away for three or four minutes, while Netty
stood waiting for my decision as to what Alice was to wear.

"Shall she put on the white muslin?" she at length asked.

"No, indeed! Certainly not! A pretty condition she'd have it in before
night! Go and get me the red and white frock, and I will mend it. You
aught to have told me it was torn this morning. You knew there was
nothing for the child to put on ut this. I never saw such a set as you
are!"

Netty flirted away, grumbling to herself. When she came in, she threw
the frock into my lap with manner so insolent and provoking that I
could hardly keep from breaking out upon her and rating her soundly.
One thing that helped to restrain me was the recollection of sundry
ebullitions of a like nature that had neither produced good effects nor
left my mind in a state of much self-respect or tranquillity.

I repaired the torn sleeve, while Netty stood by. It was the work of
but five minutes.

"Be sure," said I, as I handed the garment to Netty, "to see that one
of Alice's frocks is ironed first thing to-morrow morning."

The girl heard, of course, but she made no answer. That was rather more
of a condescension than she was willing to make just then.

Instead of thinking how easily the difficulty of the clean frock for
Alice had been gotten over, I began fretting myself because I had not
been able to procure a seamstress, although the children were "all in
rags and tatters."

"What is to be done?" I said, half crying, as I began to rock myself
backward and forward in the great rocking-chair. "I am out of all
heart." For an hour I continued to rock and fret myself, and then came
to the desperate resolution to go to work and try what I could do with
my own hands. But where was I to begin? What was I to take hold of
first? All the children were in rags.

"Not one of them has a decent garment to his back," said I.

So, after worrying for a whole hour about what I should do, and where I
should begin, I abandoned the idea of attempting any thing myself, in
despair, and concluded the perplexing debate by taking another hearty
crying-spell. The poor washerwoman was forgotten during most of this
afternoon. My own troubles were too near the axis of vision, and shut
out all other objects.

The dusky twilight had begun to fall, and I was still sitting idly in
my chamber, and as unhappy as I could be. I felt completely
discouraged. How was I to get along? I had been trying for weeks, in
vain, to get a good seamstress; and yet had no prospect of obtaining
one. I was going to lose my cook, and, in all probability, my
chambermaid. What would I do? No light broke in through the cloudy veil
that overhung my mind. The door opened, and Agnes, who had come up to
my room, said--

"Mrs. Partridge is done."

I took out my purse, and had selected therefrom the change necessary to
pay the washerwoman, when a thought of her caused me to say--

"Tell Mrs. Partridge to come up and see me."

My thoughts and feelings were changing. By the time the washerwoman
came in, my interest in her was alive again.

"Sit down," said I, to the tired-looking creature who sank into a
chair, evidently much wearied.

"It's hard work, Mrs. Partridge," said I.

"Yes, ma'am, it is rather hard. But I am thankful for health and
strength to enable me to go through with it. I know some poor women who
have to work as hard as I do, and yet do not know what it is to feel
well for an hour at a time."

"Poor creatures!" said I. "It is very hard! How in the world can they
do it?"

"We can do a great deal, ma'am, when it comes the pinch; and it is much
pleasanter to do, I find, than to think about it. If I were to think
much I should give up in despair. But I pray the Lord each morning to
give me my daily bread, and thus far he has done it, and will, I am
sure, continue to do it to the end."

"Happy it is for you that you can so think and feel," I replied. "But I
am sure I could not be as you are, Mrs. Partridge. It would kill me."

"I sincerely trust, ma'am, that you will never be called to pass
through what I have," said Mrs. Partridge. "And yet there are those who
have it still harder. There was a time when the thought of being as
poor as I now am, and of having to work so hard, would have been
terrible to me; and yet I do not know that I was so very much happier
then than I am now, though I confess I ought to have been. I had full
and plenty of every thing brought into the house by my husband, and had
only to dispense in my family the blessings of God sent to us. But I
let things annoy me then more than they do now."

"But how can you help being worried, Mrs. Partridge? To be away from my
children as you have been away from yours all day would set me wild. I
would be sure some of them would be killed or dreadfully hurt."
