said the nephew. 

Uncle Robert caught sight of the face then. It was 
tyery pale, and his eyes were heavy from lack of sleep. To 
the old resolute look there was added something stern, 
bitter. 

" You are so good to come. There was no one else. I 
am always laying burdens on you." And the voice was 
tremulous with emotion. 

"Since it is no disgrace like " Dishonesty he was 
about to add, but Rob interrupted vehemently. 

" I am not so sure of that! I have thought it over 
until I have gone almost wild." 

" Rob, let us have done with the mystery. Something 
has been on your mind a long while. I think now you 
have married, unwisely, unhappily, but better that than any 
flagrant sin." 

" O Uncle Robert! it brings back the errors of my boy- 
hood to have you guess so unerringly. Did you mistrust, 
last summer or before ? " 

' ' I fancied at first you had contracted some debt that 
you resolved to work out of honorably. But last summer 
there were little things, and you kept so away from me." 

" Yes, I was afraid. Wrong or sin always does make 
a coward of one." 

"And your wife ? " 

" We are here. I will order a little supper for us both, 
sent up to the room. It is a long story." 

Uncle Robert asked no further question until they were 
seated at their meal, and he had a little time to study the 
face. There was something beside the bitterness, a cer- 
tain vindictive force, long repressed. 

" Rob, you have done her no ill? " he cried in sudden 
alarm. 

" She has worked us both enough. Any one else woulcl 
have paid the penalty with her life." 



"Hush. Such a feeling is terrible. Rob, remember ; 
did you not choose her ? " 

He leaned his arms on the table and hid his face in them 
for several minutes. 

" I was such a blind, idiotic fool ! " he began presently. 
" I was warned, and it traversed all my plans, only I 
hardly knew it until it was done." 

' ' While you were in college ? " 

" Let me tell you from the beginning. I wonder now 
how I could have kept it so entirely away from you all ; 
but I was ashamed, and it seemed such a poor return for 
what you had done. I didn't seem to realize until it was 
all over what I might have been to you at home. Are our 
eyes always opened by these horrible contrasts, I wonder? 
I feel as if I had cut myself off from everybody. No," as 
his uncle offered him the plate of toast, " I don't want to 
eat. I 'll talk while you are having supper. It is so good 
to confess after this dreary time of secrecy. 

' ' The last winter at New Haven I used to go to a house 
where there were two bright, pretty girls, jolly and ready 
for any kind of fun. Quite a number of the boys went 
there ; it was a regular free and easy, the mother seeming 
about as young as the girls. They played and sang, and 
were beautiful dancers. Some of the fellows used to send 
wine and various things, and have gay little suppers. I 
made up my mind not to be bantered into drinking, though 
I did now and then take a glass of wine. Addie, the 
younger girl, was very sweet to me, that sort of half-hid- 
den, secret fondness that makes a mystery of a thing and 
deepens its interest. I suppose she had gone through with 
such fancies dozens of times ; but I thought it was an en- 
tirely new regard that, somehow, she couldn't help having 
for me, and that it wasn't possible for her to entertain for 
any one else. Then she possessed one of the sweet, plead- 
ing, baby faces, and I suppose after a little, with all her 
kissing and caressing, I did lose my head. I despise my- 





self so for it now, that I could not be sure no really pure, 
high-minded, honorable girl would so throw herself at a 
man's head, or a boy's, for I was nothing but that. Two 
or three of the young fellows uttered warnings, but I set 
them down to jealousy 

"Then Mrs. Weeks and Frances went to New York 
and-were gone about a month Addie was at home with 
the girl, and she used to beg me so to come, and as I 
always found her alone it was very bewildering, fascinat- 
ing. One evening she insisted on my drinking some wine 
with her, and when I refused the second glass she seemed 
so hurt, and cried a little, and said I didn't care for her 
while she cared so much for me, and would do anything to 
please me. So I drank a little more. We had fallen into 
the habit of saying silly things, making love without 
really meaning affection. I was a little startled at first by 
her way of uttering them, but she seemed so sweet and inno- 
cent about it ; and you know I had never been spoony on 
girls," with a sad little smile. " I had never really cared 
for them, and I had no more thought of marrying Addie 
Weeks than of any one I knew at Brookside. Other boys 
were carrying on flirtations, and having no end of fun out
