"No; I've got a big job on my hands."

"What's that?"

"Making a chain."

"Making a what?"

"Making a chain."

"A watch chain?"

"I think it will be a watch chain; but I'll tell you about it when we
are alone. Do you understand?"

"No, I don't."

"Keep still then."

Shuffles turned in, and the others followed his example. He did not
sleep, if they did, for his soul was full of rage and malice. He was
studying up the means of revenge; and he had matured a project, so
foolhardy that it was ridiculous, and his mind was fully occupied with
it.

At twelve o'clock he was called to take his place with the first part of
the port watch on deck. Belonging to each quarter watch, there were five
petty officers, four of whom were to call the portion of the crew who
were to relieve those on duty. Shuffles was called by one of these.

The wind was freshening when he went on deck, and the ship was going
rapidly through the water. At the last heaving of the log she was making
eleven knots, with her studding sails still set. Mr. Fluxion came on
deck at eight bells.

Wilton, Sanborn, and Adler were in the watch with Shuffles, and the
malcontent lost not a moment in pushing forward the scheme he had
matured. Fortunately or unfortunately, he was placed on the lookout with
Wilton, and the solitude of the top-gallant forecastle afforded them a
good opportunity for the conference.

THE GAMBLERS IN NO. 8.


"It's coming on to blow," said Wilton, as the lookouts took their
stations on the top-gallant forecastle.

"I don't think it will blow much; it is only freshening a little,"
replied Shuffles.

"Now, what about the mutiny?" demanded Wilton, impatiently, after he had
become more accustomed to the dash of the sea under the bows of the
ship.

"Don't call it by that name," replied Shuffles, earnestly. "Never use
that word again."

"That's what you mean--isn't it? You might as well call things by their
right names."

"It's an ugly word, and if any one should happen to hear it, their
attention would be attracted at once. We musn't get in the habit of
using it."

"I don't know what you are going to do yet," added Wilton.

"It's a big job; but I mean to put it through, even if I am sure of
failure."

"What's the use of doing that? Do you want to get the fellows into a
scrape for nothing?"

"There will be no failure, Wilton; you may depend upon that. There will
be a row on board within a day or two, and, if I mistake not, nearly
all the fellows will be so mad that they will want to join us."

"What row?"

"Do you know the reason why I wouldn't shake props this evening?"

"I'm sure I don't."

"Lowington has found out what is going on in the rooms."

"He hasn't, though!"

"Yes, he has."

"How do you know?"

"What odds does it make how I know?" answered Shuffles, impatiently, for
Wilton was much too inquisitive to suit his purposes. "I talked with the
chaplain half an hour to-night. When he went to my berth after the wine,
I rather think he heard the rattle of the props. At any rate the whole
thing will be broken up to-morrow or next day."

"I don't see how that will make a row. Not more than a dozen fellows
have played any; and they won't think of making a row about that."

"You see!" added Shuffles, confidently.

"Ugh!" exclaimed Wilton, as a cloud of spray dashed over the bow, and
drenched the lookout; but they wore their pea-jackets, and such an
occurrence was to be expected at sea.

"Stand by to take in studding sails!" shouted Paul Kendall, who was the
officer of the deck; and the order was repeated by his subordinates in
the waist and on the forecastle.

"We must go," said Wilton; and they descended from their position.

The wind had continued to freshen, until the ship labored somewhat under
her heavy press of canvas. It was the policy of the principal to go as
easily and comfortably as possible, and he had directed Mr. Fluxion, if
