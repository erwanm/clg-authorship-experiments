" No, not that, Joe. It 's all been a silly sort of 
extravagance. I am mad at myself when I think 
of it." He wouldn't say he had been tempted by 
a girl into much unwise expenditure. How could 
he have been so weak ! 

" It will be all right," returned Joe. " I am glad 
it is not gambling debts; though a hundred dollars 
wouldn't cover much. I hope you are coming 
through in good shape." 

" You may be sure of that. Oh, Joe, how kind 
you are ! ' 

" What is brotherhood for, if not that? " said Joe, 
gravely. 



He would not put himself in the way of meeting 
Miss Ludlow, though she did send him two rather 
plaintive notes. Early in June, the marriage took 
place; and the bride's trousseau was quite magni- 
ficent, if it was not made in Paris. Mrs. Nicoll 
was delighted with what she termed her grand- 
niece's good sense, and gave her a handsome set 
of rubies, beside having her diamonds reset for 
her. And when she died, some two months later, 
it was found she had made a new will on Lily's 
wedding day, in which she bequeathed the bride 
all her personal effects and some valuable bank- 
stock, if the amount was not very large. The 
next winter, Mrs. Williamson took her place in 
society, and was quite a married belle, managing 
her husband as adroitly as she had managed her 
lovers. 

Jim studied day and almost night to make up 
for the dissipation of the winter, and passed with 
honour, though Joe had hoped he would have one 
of the orations. He went immediately into the law 
office of a friend of Stephen's as clerk and copy- 
ist while he was waiting for the new term of the 
law school. 

Charles Reed did distinguish himself, and was 
one of the heroes of the occasion. He was a fine, 
manly fellow now, and Mrs. Dean loved him like 
a son. Indeed, it seemed as if he might be her 
son, the young people were so much to each 
other. Josie would graduate the next year at the 
high school. 

Ben and Delia had gone along through the winter 



with very little change, except to learn how much 
they loved each other. The young men did not 
have quite such rollicking good times, though Nora 
was developing into a very attractive young girl 
and enchanted them with her singing. Delia was 
very busy trying her best to come up to some high 
standards of literary work. Everybody was not a 
genius in those days. Colleges had not begun to 
turn them out by the score, and the elder people 
were very often helpful to the younger ones. 

There was, it is true, a certain kind of Bohemian- 
ism among the men that proved dangerous to 
more than one fine, promising mind. Ben liked 
the bright wit and keen encounters, and the talk 
that ran through centuries of intellectual activity 
as if it was only yesterday. He was taking a 
curious interest in politics as well, for some great 
questions were coming to the fore. 

Mrs. Underbill had preserved a cautious silence 
respecting Delia, indeed, ignored the whole matter. 
Dolly was cordial when they met. Jim had been 
so taken up with his engrossing experience that 
he rarely went to Beach Street ; and the two sets 
of society were widely apart. Delia had supposed 
everything would come around straight ; it generally 
did in her happy-go-lucky fashion. 

But on Commencement day, when she was all 
smiles and gladness, Mrs. Underbill's coolness and 
Mrs. Hoffman's stately distance quite amazed her. 

" Ben," she said, " something has happened with 
your people. Your mother hardly spoke to me, and 
Margaret was icy. And now that I come to think 


of it, Hannv hasn't been near us since Nora's birth- 


day February that was. Are they offended be- 
cause- -don't they like our engagement? And I 
love them all so, from least to greatest; only 
Margaret is rather high up." 

" Hanny 's had such lots of lessons, and her 
music, and she 's corresponding with Daisy Jasper 
in French. Grandmother takes her time, too. 
You don't have so much leisure out of child- 
hood." 

" What jolly times we had back there in First 
Street ! Oh, Ben, I did like you all so much ! 
And I can't bear to have the good feeling die 
out." 

There were tears in Delia's brown eyes. Ben 
was moved immeasurably. 

" May be I ought to have said something to 
mother; Joe counselled me to wait."
