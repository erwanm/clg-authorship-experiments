and read it:

     "VARICK MANOR,
     "June the 2d.
     "An hour to dawn.

     "In my bedroom I am writing to you the adieu I should have
     said the night you left. Murphy, a rifleman, goes to you with
     despatches in an hour: he will take this to you, ...
     wherever you are.

     "I saw the man you sent in. Father says he must surely hang.
     He was so pale and silent, he looked so dreadfully tired--and
     I have been crying a little--I don't know why, because all
     say he is a great villain.

     "I wonder whether you are well and whether you remember me."
     ("me" was crossed out and "us" written very carefully.) "The
     house is so strange without you. I go into your room
     sometimes. Cato has pressed all your fine clothes. I go into
     your room to read. The light is very good there. I am reading
     the Poems of Pansard. You left a fern between the pages to
     mark the poem called 'Our Deaths'; did you know it? Do you
     admire that verse? It seems sad to me. And it is not true,
     either. Lovers seldom die together." (This was crossed out,
     and the letter went on.) "Two people who love--" ("love" was
     crossed out heavily and the line continued)--"two friends
     seldom die at the same instant. Otherwise there would be no
     terror in death.

     "I forgot to say that Isene, your mare, is very well. Papa
     and the children are well, and Ruyven a-pestering General
     Schuyler to make him a cornet in the legion of horse, and
     Cecile, all airs, goes about with six officers to carry her
     shawl and fan.

     "For me--I sit with Lady Schuyler when I have the
     opportunity. I love her; she is so quiet and gentle and lets
     me sit by her for hours, perfectly silent. Yesterday she came
     into your room, where I was sitting, and she looked at me for
     a long time--so strangely--and I asked her why, and she shook
     her head. And after she had gone I arranged your linen and
     sprinkled lavender among it.

     "You see there is so little to tell you, except that in the
     afternoon some Senecas and Tories shot at one of our distant
     tenants, a poor man, one Christian Schell; and he beat them
     off and killed eleven, which was very brave, and one of the
     soldiers made a rude song about it, and they have been
     singing it all night in their quarters. I heard them from
     your room--where I sometimes sleep--the air being good there;
     and this is what they sang:

     "'A story, a story
       Unto you I will tell,
     Concerning a brave hero,
       One Christian Schell.

     "'Who was attacked by the savages.
       And Tories, it is said;
     But for this attack
       Most freely they bled.

     "'He fled unto his house
       For to save his life.
     Where he had left his arms
       In care of his wife.

     "'They advanced upon him
       And began to fire,
     But Christian with his blunderbuss
       Soon made them retire.

     "'He wounded Donald McDonald
       And drew him in the door,
     Who gave an account
       Their strength was sixty-four.

     "'Six there was wounded
       And eleven there was killed
     Of this said party,
       Before they quit the field.'

     "And I think there are a hundred other verses, which I will
     spare you; not that I forget them, for the soldiers sang them
     over and over, and I had nothing better to do than to lie
     awake and listen.

     "So that is all. I hear my messenger moving about below; I am
     to drop this letter down to him, as all are asleep, and to
     open the big door might wake them.

     "Good-bye.

       *       *       *       *       *

     "It was not my rifleman, only the sentry. They keep double
     watch since the news came about Schell. "Good-bye. I am
     thinking of you.

     "DOROTHY.

     "Postscript.--Please make my compliments and adieux to Sir
     George Covert.

     "Postscript.--The rifleman is here; he is whistling like a
     whippoorwill. I must say good-bye. I am mad to go with him.
     Do not forget me!

     "My memories are so keen, so pitilessly real, I can scarce
     endure them, yet cling to them the more desperately.

     "I did not mean to write this--truly I did not! But here, in
     the dusk, I can see your face just as it looked when you said
     good-bye!--so close that I could take it in my arms despite
     my vows and yours!

     "Help me to reason; for even God cannot, or will not, help
     me; knowing, perhaps, the dreadful after-life He has doomed
     me to for all eternity. If it is true that marriages are made
