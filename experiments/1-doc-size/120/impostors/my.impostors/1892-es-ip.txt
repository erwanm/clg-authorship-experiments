The phallus was as common to them, 
commoner even. It was on the coins, 
on the doors, in the gardens. As a 
preservative against Envy ithungfrom 
children's necks. On sun-dials and 
water-clocks it marked the flight of 
time. The vestals worshipped it. At 
weddings it was used in a manner 
which need not be described. 

It was from such surroundings that 
Faustine stepped into the arms of the 
severe and stately prince whom her 
father had chosen. That Marcus 
Aurelius adored her is certain. Hi  
note-book shows it, A more tender
hearted and perfect lover romance may
show, but history cannot. He must  
have been the quintessence of refinement, a thoroughbred to his finger- 
tips; one for whom that purple mantle 
was too gaudy, and yet who bore it, 
as he bore everything else, in that 
self-abnegatory spirit which the 
higher reaches of philosophy bring. 
He was of that rare type that never 
complains and always consoles. 

After Antonin's death, his hours 
ceased to be his own. On the 
Euphrates there was the wildest disorder. To the north new races were 
pushing nations over the Danube and 
the Rhine. From the catacombs Christ 
was emerging; from the Nile, Serapis. 
The empire was in disarray. Antonin 
had provided his son-in-law with a 
coadjutor, Lucius Verus, the son of 
Hadrian's mignon, a magnificent scoundrel; a tall, broad-shouldered athlete, 
with a skin as fresh as a girl's and 
thick curly hair, which he covered 
with a powder of gold; a viveur  
whose suppers are famous still; whose 
guests were given the slaves that 
served them, the plate off which they 
had eaten, the cups from which they 
had drunk — cups of gold, cups of silver, jeweled cups, cups from Alexan- 
dria, murrhine vases filled with nard — 
cars and litters to go home with, 
mules with silver trappings and negro 
muleteers. Capitolinus says that, 
while the guests feasted, sometimes 
the magnificent Verus got drunk  and 
was carried to bed in a coverlid, or 
else, the red feather aiding, turned 
out and fought the watch. 

It was this splendid individual to 
whom Marcus Aurelius intrusted the 
Euphrates. They had been brought 
up together, sharing each others 
tutors, writing themes for the same instructor, both meanwhile adolescently 
enamored of the fair Faustine. It was 
to Marcus she was given, the empiix' 
as a dower; and when that dower 
passed into his hands, he could think 
of nothing more equitable than to ask 
Verus to share it with him. Verus 
was not stupid enough to refuse, and 
at the hour when the Parthians turned 
ugly, he needed little urging to set out 
for the East, dreaming, as he did so, 
of creating there an empire that should 
be wholly his. 

At that time Faustine must have 
been at least twenty-eight, possibly 
thirty. There were matrons who had 
not Keen their fifteenth year, and 
Faustine had been married young. 
Her daughter, Lucille, was nubile. 
Presently Verus, or rather his lieutenants, succeeded, and the girl 
was betrothed to him. There was a 
festival, of course, games in abundance, and plenty of blood. 

It would have been interesting to 
have seen her that day, the iron ring 
of betrothal on her finger, her brother, 
Commodus, staring at the arrangement of her hair, her mother prettily 
perplexed, her father signing orders 
which messengers brought and dispatched, while the sand took on a 
deeper red, and Rome shrieked its 
delight. Yes, it would have been 
interesting and typical of the hour. 
Her hair in the ten tresses which 
were symbolic of a fiancee's innocence, 
must have amused that brute of a 
brother of hers, and the iron ring on 
the fourth finger of her left hand 
must have given Faustine food for 
thought ; the vestals, in their immaculate robes, must have gazed at her 
in curious, sisterly ways, and because 
of her fresh beauty surely there 
were undertones of applause. Should 
her father disappear she would 
make a gracious imperatrix indeed. 
But, meanwhile, there was Faus- 
tine, and at sight of her legends of 
old imperial days returned. She was 
not Messalina yet, but in the stables 
there were jockeys whose sudden 
wealth surprised no one; in the arenas 
there were gladiators that fought, not 
for liberty, nor for death, but for the 
caresses of her eyes; in the side-scenes 
there were mimes who spoke of her; 
there were senators who boasted in 
their cups, and in the theatre Rome 
laughed colossally at the catchword 
of her amours. 

Marcus Aurelius then was occi,
