bound and never read. The commentator is not only impertinent, he 
is a bore. 

In his work on the Caesars, Suetonius drew breath but once — he called 
Nero a monster. Subsequently he 
must have regretted having done so 
not because Nero was not a monster 
but because it was sufficient to display the beast without adding a de 
scriptive placard. In that was Sueto 
nius' advantage; he could describe. 
In the present era a writer may not. 
There are details, however historical, 
into which he must decline to enter. 
Even to blase initiates of old world 
libraries he may not suggest. Heliogabalus presents that difficulty. It 
is not merely that he was depraved, 
for all of that lot were; it was that he 
made depravity a pursuit; and the 
purple favoring, carried it not only 



 



beyond the limits of the imaginable, 
but beyond the limits of the real. At 
the feet of that painted boy, Elephantis 
and Parrhasius could have sat and 
learned a lesson. Apart from that 
phase of his sovereignty, he was a 
little Sardanapalus, an Asiatic raignon, who found himself great. 

It would have been curious to have 
seen him in that wonderful palace, 
clothed like a Persian queen, insisting 
that he should be addressed as Imperatrix, and quite living up to the title. 
It would not only be interesting, it 
would give one an insight into just 
how much the Romans could stand. 
It would have been curious, also, to 
have assisted at that superb and poetic 
ceremonial, in which, having got 
Tanit from Carthage as consort for 
Elagabal, he presided, girt with the 
pomp of church and state, over the 
nuptials of the Sun and Moon. 



 

He had read Suetonius, and not an 
eccentricity of the Caesars escaped 
him. He would not hunt flies by the 
hour, as Domitian had done, for that 
would be mere imitation; but he could 
collect cobwebs, and he did, by the 
ton. Caligula and Vitellius had been 
famous as hosts, but the feasts that 
Heliogabalus gave outranked them 
for sheer splendor. From panels in 
the ceiling such masses of flowers fell 
that guests were smothered before 
they could escape. Those that sur- 
vived had set before them glass game 
and sweets of crystal. The menu was 
embroidered on the table cloth — not 
the mere list of dishes, but pictures 
drawn with the needle of the dishes 
themselves. And presently, after the 
little jest in glass had been enjoyed, 
you were served with camel's heels; 
combs torn from living cocks; plat- 
ters of nightingale tongues; ostrich 



 



brains, prepared with that garum 
sauce which the Sybarites invented, 
and of which the secret is lost; therewith were peas and grains of gold; 
beans and amber; quail, peppered with 
pearl dust; lentils and rubies; spiders 
in jelly; lion's dung, served in pastry. 
The guests that wine overcame were 
carried to bed-rooms. When they 
awoke, there staring at them were 
tigers and leopards — tame, of course; 
but some of the guests were stupid 
enough not to know it, and died of 
fright. 

All this was of a nature to amuse a 
lad who had made the phallus the 
chief object of worship; who had 
banished Jupiter, dismissed Isis; who, 
over paths that were strewn with 
lilies, had himself, in the attributes of 
Bacchus, drawn by tigers; by lions as 
Mother of the Gods; again, by naked 
women, as Heliogabalus on his way 
to wed a vestal, and procure for the 
empire a child that should be wholly 
divine. 

It amused Rome, too, and his prodigalities in the circus were such 
that Lampridus admits that the people were glad he was emperor. 
Neither Caligula nor Nero had 
been as lavish, and neither Caligula 
nor Nero as cruel. The atrocities he 
committed, .if less vast than those of
