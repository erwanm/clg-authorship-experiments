store, and only said this by way of making conversation, and
encouraging the boys to be social.

"You haven't any of you gents seen a pearl-handled knife, have you?"
he asked.

"No," said Fosdick; "have you lost one?"

"Yes," said Travis, with unblushing falsehood. "I left it on my
bureau a day or two since. I've missed one or two other little
matters. Bridget don't look to me any too honest. Likely she's
got 'em."

"What are you goin' to do about it?" said Dick.

"I'll keep mum unless I lose something more, and then I'll kick up a
row, and haul her over the coals. Have you missed anything?"

"No," said Fosdick, answering for himself, as he could do without
violating the truth.

There was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of Travis, as he heard
this.

"They haven't found it out yet," he thought. "I'll bag the money
to-day, and then they may whistle for it."

Having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys, he bade
them good-morning, and turned down another street.

"He's mighty friendly all of a sudden," said Dick.

"Yes," said Fosdick; "it's very evident what it all means. He wants
to find out whether you have discovered your loss or not."

"But he didn't find out."

"No; we've put him on the wrong track. He means to get his money
to-day, no doubt."

"My money," suggested Dick.

"I accept the correction," said Fosdick.

"Of course, Dick, you'll be on hand as soon as the bank opens."

"In course I shall. Jim Travis'll find he's walked into the
wrong shop."

"The bank opens at ten o'clock, you know."

"I'll be there on time."

The two boys separated.

"Good luck, Dick," said Fosdick, as he parted from him. "It'll all
come out right, I think."

"I hope 'twill," said Dick.

He had recovered from his temporary depression, and made up his mind
that the money would be recovered. He had no idea of allowing
himself to be outwitted by Jim Travis, and enjoyed already, in
anticipation, the pleasure of defeating his rascality.

It wanted two hours and a half yet to ten o'clock, and this time to
Dick was too precious to be wasted. It was the time of his greatest
harvest. He accordingly repaired to his usual place of business,
succeeded in obtaining six customers, which yielded him sixty cents.
He then went to a restaurant, and got some breakfast. It was now
half-past nine, and Dick, feeling that it wouldn't do to be late,
left his box in charge of Johnny Nolan, and made his way to the
bank.

The officers had not yet arrived, and Dick lingered on the outside,
waiting till they should come. He was not without a little
uneasiness, fearing that Travis might be as prompt as himself, and
finding him there, might suspect something, and so escape the snare.
But, though looking cautiously up and down the street, he could
discover no traces of the supposed thief. In due time ten o'clock
struck, and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown
open, and our hero entered.

As Dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last
nine months, the cashier had come to know him by sight.

"You're early, this morning, my lad," he said, pleasantly. "Have you
got some more money to deposit? You'll be getting rich, soon."

"I don't know about that," said Dick. "My bank-book's been stole."

"Stolen!" echoed the cashier. "That's unfortunate. Not so bad as it
might be, though. The thief can't collect the money."

"That's what I came to see about," said Dick. "I was afraid he might
have got it already."

"He hasn't been here yet. Even if he had, I remember you, and should
have detected him. When was it taken?"

"Yesterday," said Dick. "I missed it in the evenin' when I
got home."

"Have you any suspicion as to the person who took it?" asked
the cashier.

Dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and
suspicious conduct of Jim Travis, and the cashier agreed with him
that he was probably the thief. Dick also gave his reason for
thinking that he would visit the bank that morning, to withdraw
the funds.

"Very good," said the cashier. "We'll be ready for him. What is the
number of your book?"

"No. 5,678," said Dick.

"Now give me a little description of this Travis whom you suspect."

Dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of Travis, not
