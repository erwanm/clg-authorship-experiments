ing took place — as did most of Hal's social experiences — 
on a Sunday. Jerry had just had a sleep and a wash, 
and had put on a pair of new blue overalls, so that he pre- 
sented a cheering aspect in the sunlight. He walked with 
his head up and his shoulders square, and one could see 
that he had few cares in the world. 

But what caught Hal's attention was not so much Jerry 
as what followed at Jerry's heels ; a perfect reproduction 
of him, quarter-size, also with a newly-washed face and a 
pair of new blue overalls. He too had his head up, and 
his shoulders square, and he was an irresistible object, 
throwing out his heels and trying his best to keep step. 
Since the longest strides he could take left him behind, 



 

lie would break into a run, and getting close under his 
father's heels, would begin keeping step once more. 

Hal was going in the same direction, and it affected him 
like the music of a military band ; he too wanted to throw 
his head up and square his shoulders and keep step. And 
then other people, seeing the grin on his face, would turn 
and watch, and grin also. But Jerry walked on gravely, 
unaware of this circus in the rear. 

They went into a house ; and Hal, having nothing to do 
but enjoy life, stood waiting for them to come out. They 
returned in the same procession, only now the man had a 
sack of something on his shoulder, while the little chap had 
a smaller load poised in imitation. So Hal grinned again, 
and when they were opposite him, he said, " Hello." 

" Hello ' said Jerry, and stopped. Then, seeing Hal's 
grin, he grinned back; and Hal looked at the little chap 
and grinned, and the little chap grinned back. Jerry, 
seeing what Hal was grinning at, grinned more than ever ; 
so there stood all three in the middle of the road, grinning 
at one another for no apparent reason. 

" Gee, but that's a great kid ! " said Hal. 

" Gee, you bet ! " said Jerry ; and he set down his sack. 
If some one desired to admire the kid, he was willing to 
stop any length of time. 

" Yours ? " asked Hal. 

" You bet ! " said Jerry, again.  

" Hello, Buster ! " said Hal. ;* 

" Hello yourself ! " said the kid. One could see in a 
moment that he had been in the " melting-pot." 

" What's your name ? " asked Hal. 

" Jerry," was the reply. 

" And what's his name ? " Hal nodded towards the man. 

" Big Jerry." 

" Got any more like you at home ? " 

" One more," said Big Jerry. " Baby." 

« He ain't like me," said Little Jerry. " He's little." 



 

" And you're big ? " said Hal. 

"He can't walk!" 

" Neither can you walk ! " laughed Hal, and caught him 
up and slung him onto his shoulder. " Come on, we'll 
ride ! " 

So Big Jerry took up his sack again, and they started 
off; only this time it was Hal who fell behind and kept 
step, squaring his shoulders and flinging out his heels. 
Little Jerry caught onto the joke, and giggled and kicked 
his sturdy legs with delight. Big Jerry would look round, 
not knowing what the joke was, but enjoying it just the 
same. 

They came to the three-room cabin which was Both 
Jerrys' home; and Mrs. Jerry came to the door, a black- 
eyed Sicilian girl, who did not look old enough to have 
even one baby. They had another bout of grinning, at 
the end of which Big Jerry said, " You come in ? " 

" Sure," said Hal. 

" You stay supper," added the other. " Got spaghetti." 

" Gee ! " said Hal. " All right, let me stay, and pay 
for it." 

" Hell, no ! " said Jerry. " You no pay ! " 

" No ! No pay ! " cried Mrs. Jerry, shaking her pretty 
head energetically. 

" All right," said Hal, quickly, seeing that he might 
hi#t their feelings. " I'll stay if you're sure you have 
enqgigh." 

" Sure, plenty ! " said Jerry. " Hey, Rosa ? " 

" Sure, plenty ! " said Mrs. Jerry. 

"Then I'll stay," said Hal. "You like spaghetti, 
Kid?"
