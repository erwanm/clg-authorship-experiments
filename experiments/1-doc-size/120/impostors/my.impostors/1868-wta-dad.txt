At half past twelve, the professors' barge, with the American flag in
the stern, and the Belgian in the bow, put off from the ship and pulled
to the Quai Vandyck. The eminent individual who was to be received by
the squadron was no less a personage than the governor of the Province
of Antwerp, an office once filled by the distinguished Charles Rogier,
the present minister of foreign affairs.

As the boat containing his excellency put off from the Quay, the yards
of both vessels were manned. All the students were dressed in their best
uniform, and the display was really quite imposing. The governor went
on board of the ship, was duly cheered by the students, and he visited
every part of the vessel. After he had partaken of a collation in the
main cabin, he left the ship, accompanied by Mr. Lowington, and visited
the Josephine. Everything appeared to the best advantage, and his
excellency expressed himself as highly delighted with the naval
institution.

All the officers and professors were presented to the distinguished
guest, who took a great deal of notice of Paul, and hardly any of Mr.
Hamblin--a muddling of distinctions which sore puzzled and annoyed the
savant. Not even Mr. Lowington could have suspected that the
Josephines were in a state of feverish excitement, and had been almost
in a state of mutiny, so fair and pleasant was the outside aspect of the
ship's company. The governor, having completed his inspection of the
vessel, invited all the officers to dine with him, and was then landed
with as much ceremony as he had been received.

Mr. Lowington accompanied the governor to the quay, and on his return he
went on board of the Josephine to announce his programme for a visit to
several of the cities of Belgium. All hands were called, and were
informed that the next three days would be devoted to sight-seeing, and
that the students would take the train for Ghent at half past two. The
ship's company heard the intelligence with a coolness which did not
escape the notice of the principal; but he soon received an explanation
of this apparent indifference.

"I am very sorry, Mr. Lowington," said Professor Hamblin, stepping up
to him, as he descended from the hatch, "to be again compelled to
complain to you of the misconduct of Mr. Kendall. This morning he
threatened to arrest me and send me in irons on board of the ship--me,
sir! He actually sent for the boatswain and carpenter for this purpose."

"Captain Kendall!" exclaimed the principal, annoyed beyond measure at
this recital of grievance. "There must have been some strong
provocation."

"Could anything justify such a threat, or such a course?"

"We will not speak of this subject here," added the principal, when he
saw that the eyes of every student on board were fixed upon them.

"Something should be done immediately," replied Mr. Hamblin, decidedly.

"I have not time to hear the case now. We take the train for Ghent in
less than an hour. I will see you in the railway carriage."

Mr. Lowington moved towards the gangway, where the barge was waiting for
him; but Paul, his cheeks all aglow, stepped up to him, and touched his
cap.

"Mr. Lowington," said he, "I wish to make a complaint against Mr.
Hamblin. He interferes with the discipline of the vessel, is very
insulting to me; and I must ask that he be removed from the Josephine,
or that I may be permitted to resign."

"I am very sorry you are having any trouble here; but I cannot stay now
to hear about it. I will see you on the train."

"Excuse me, one moment, Mr. Lowington," added the savant of the
Josephine, as the principal was going over the side. "I wish to inquire
if we make any stay in Brussels?"

"We shall probably remain there one day."

"I have an invitation to visit Monsieur Rogier, the chief minister of
the King of Belgium, and should like to accept it," added Mr. Hamblin,
who thought it would be well for the principal to know this fact before
he thought much of the difficulty between himself and the captain.

"You will have ample time," answered Mr. Lowington, as he stepped over
the side into the boat.

At two o'clock all hands embarked in a ferry-boat, which conveyed them
to the TÃªte de Flandre, opposite Antwerp, where the Ghent railway
station is located. By the good offices of the governor of Antwerp, a
special train had been procured for their accommodation, and the
carriages were to be at the disposal of the principal for the entire
round of the Belgian cities. By this arrangement, the tourists were
enabled to make the tour in the brief space allotted to it. They were to
spend a day in the capital, but only one or two hours in each of the
other places.

In Belgium about two thirds of all the railways are owned or leased by
the government, which runs the roads, and even those which are in the
hands of corporations will eventually revert to the state. They are
exceedingly well managed, and very few accidents occur upon them; but
they run at a low rate of speed, compared with the English railways. The
fares are about three cents a mile, which is below the average in
Europe.

Mr. Lowington selected a compartment in one of the carriages, and
arranged his party so as to transact the disagreeable business on hand
during the trip. Dr. Winstock and Paul sat at one end of the section,
and Mr. Stoute and Terrill at the other, while Mr. Lowington and
Professor Hamblin occupied the middle seats. The two students were
allowed to occupy the places at the windows, so that they could see the
country which they passed through; for the principal deemed this as
important for them as their lessons; in fact, it was a study of
geography. The train moved off, bearing the company through a low
country, not very attractive in itself, though the little farms,
gardens, villages and towns were full of interest to young men like
Paul.

"Now, Mr. Hamblin, I am ready to hear your complaints," said Mr.
Lowington, after the train had passed out of the station. "Captain
Kendall, you may give your attention to it, though you can look out of
the window at the same time."

"Am I to be confronted with that boy?" demanded the professor,
