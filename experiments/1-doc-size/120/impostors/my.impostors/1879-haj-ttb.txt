times we had fishing and swimming together?"

"Yes, I believe I do remember you now," drawled Victor, still not
offering his hand, or expressing any pleasure at the meeting. "When did
you come to the city?"

"I have been here two or three weeks," replied Frank.

"Oh, indeed! Are you going to remain?"

"Yes, if I can earn a living."

Victor scanned Frank's clothes with a critical, and evidently rather
contemptuous, glance.

"What are you doing?" he asked. "Are you in a store?"

"No; I am selling papers."

"A newsboy!" said Victor, with a curve of the lip.

"Yes," answered Frank, his pleasure quite chilled by Victor's manner.

"Are you doing well?" asked Victor, more from curiosity than interest.

"I am making my expenses."

"How do you happen to be in this neighborhood? I suppose you sell papers
down-town."

"Yes, but I am invited to dinner."

"Not here--on the avenue!" ejaculated Victor.

"Yes," answered Frank, enjoying the other's surprise.

"Where?"

Frank mentioned the number.

"Why, that is next to my house. Mr. Bowen lives there."

"Yes."

"Perhaps you know some of the servants," suggested Victor.

"I know one," said Frank, smiling, for he read Victor's thoughts; "but
my invitation comes from Mr. Bowen."

"Did you ever dine there before?" asked Victor, puzzled.

"Yes, last week."

"You must excuse my mentioning it, but I should hardly think you would
like to sit down at a gentleman's table in that shabby suit."

"I don't," answered Frank; "but I have no better."

"Then you ought to decline the invitation."

"I would, but for appearing impolite."

"It seems very strange that Mr. Bowen should invite a newsboy to
dinner."

"Perhaps if you'd mention what you think of it," said Frank, somewhat
nettled, "he would recall the invitation."

"Oh, it's nothing to me," said Victor; "but I thought I'd mention it, as
I know more of etiquette than you do."

"You are very considerate," said Frank, with a slight tinge of sarcasm
in his tone.

By this time he had reached the house of Mr. Bowen, and the two boys
parted.

Frank could not help thinking a little about what Victor had said. His
suit, as he looked down at it, seemed shabbier than ever. Again it
occurred to him that perhaps Mr. Bowen had forgotten the invitation, and
this would make it very awkward for him. As he waited for the door to
open he decided that, if it should appear that he was not expected, he
would give some excuse, and go away.

Susan opened the door.

"Mr. Bowen invited me to come here to dinner to-night," began Frank,
rather nervously.

"Yes, you are expected," said Susan, very much to his relief. "Wipe your
feet, and come right in."

Frank obeyed.

"You are to go upstairs and get ready for dinner," said Susan, and she
led the way to the same chamber into which our hero had been ushered the
week before.

"There won't be much getting ready," thought Frank. "However, I can stay
there till I hear the bell ring."

As he entered the room he saw a suit of clothes and some underclothing
lying on the bed.

"They are for you," said Susan, laconically.

"For me!" exclaimed Frank, in surprise.

"Yes, put them on, and when you come down to dinner Mr. Bowen will see
how they fit."

"Is it a present from him?" asked Frank, overwhelmed with surprise and
gratitude, for he could see that the clothes were very handsome.

"Well, they aint from me," said Susan, "so it's likely they come from
him. Don't be too long, for Mr. Bowen doesn't like to have any one late
to dinner."

Susan had been in the service of her present mistress fifteen years, and
was a privileged character. She liked to have her own way; but had
