She said, 'How I should like to hear Miss Lawrence sing some of her
pathetic old ballads!'"

"You know all the sweet and tender ones."

"I sing mine over daily," and Sylvie laughed with a dainty inflection.

Irene went home, and opened her piano. It might have made jarring
discord, but for Fred's thoughtfulness. She found it was in perfect
tune.

Was it the music that brought a curious intensity to her after all these
long, dreary months? Her fingers seemed a little stiff at first, and
some things had gone out of her mind. Then she dropped her face into her
hands, and thought.

"It is my only gift," she said slowly. "When they are married I will not
be a burthen on them: I can make my way. I shall never try to think of
marriage again;" and she shuddered.

"I declare, you are quite like yourself," said her mother that evening.

The weeks went on. Miss Barry was making plans for her niece. She could
not live here alone, even for a few months. And she longed to see her
married. Though the others had almost forgotten how surely her days were
numbered, she had not.

Fred assented delicately to her proposal.

"It is not as if there were only your income," she said with a touch of
pride. "Sylvie will have enough to keep the old house as it is kept now,
and your mother and sister have some claims on you. Still, for her
sake"--

Sylvie would fain have put it off, but she was gently overruled. The
wedding-garments were ordered, the day appointed. A quiet marriage in
the pretty parlor, with only a few friends. They brought Miss Barry down
stairs, and she listened while her darling reverently repeated her vows.
They kissed the new bride while the tears were shining in her eyes, and
sent her on a brief wedding-journey with heartfelt blessings. Maverick
was to telegraph to them every day.

Fred Lawrence could hardly believe his happiness. They were like two
children out on a pleasure-excursion, not needing to realize the gravity
of life in these golden days. What cared they for pale winter suns and
shivering blasts!

Long ago he had planned a brilliant tour to Europe for her. He had gone
over it all, and would only have been bored; but it was the thing to do,
and he might enjoy her fresh delight in it. But to both of them--to him
especially--had come the higher revelations of life. It is the
aggregation of individual characteristics that makes the sum-total of
national character; and though at first retrenchment and economy seemed
hideous words to the pleasure-loving, easy-going, self-indulgent souls
nursed in the lap of prosperity, there was coming a realization to those
who had fought their way valiantly across the yawning gulf, that the hot
race for show, the desire to exceed one another, was not a lofty aim for
an immortal soul, hardly for a cultured nature.

They both understood that beauty and grandeur were not far-off, hardly
attained ideals, and that the great pleasures were set in the world
rather as incentives and rewards, than highly seasoned daily food which
must inevitably produce satiety. Some time, when they had earned this
glorious vacation, they would take it hungering with the healthy
appetite of a well-trained soul. At present the duty was to deny one's
self firmly and contentedly, to round off the sharp corners, to shape
the daily living to high, pure purposes; so that the greater excellences
of Art should not despise the minor forms, the steps whereby true
perfection was attained, the tangled threads that often required more
real genius to comprehend than the one great moment of inspiration.

They came home again fresh and bright, with the peculiar fragrance of a
new life about them, just as you shall smell spring in the woods on some
mild, sunny February day. Fred fluctuated between office and city, quite
a prophet of household art, welcomed warmly back to the old circles
which had so quietly dropped him for a while. Is there not a great deal
of this unconscious proving of the fine metal of souls in the world? We
cry out as we are thrust aside, or given some hard task to do; we wonder
people do not hold out kindly hands, smile with sympathetic eyes; and
yet their very help might weaken us. When we have beaten our way across
with the roar of the distant waves still in our ears, the shadows of the
black, fierce, jagged cliff hardly faded, the taste of the brackish
spray still lingering on our lips, an exultant thrill speeds through
every nerve as we clasp a hand that has had to buffet through the same
fateful current.

Early in April Miss Barry had another seizure, a fatal stroke this time.
For a few days she lay in sweet content; and then dropped peacefully out
of existence.

It seems always a mystery, why such earnest, useful souls, doing that
highest of all work,--a pure, unselfish charity,--should be taken away,
and the slothful, dependent, ease-loving, selfish ones left. The Darcys
felt that Mrs. Lawrence could have been spared much more easily, and
served a higher economy in point of usefulness. But God, who sees every
end from the beginning, and is all-wise, judges differently. Miss Barry
had done her work, no light life-task either. Only God knew what it had
been, days of toil and nights of watching and prayer, such pain as only
a strong soul could have kept to itself, and smiled over. Yet she had
her exceeding sweet reward in this world,--years of peace and comfort,
the child-love she had missed in one way, supplied in another, the hope
of her days crowned more wisely by the waiting.

They did not think it worth while to keep up the two households; indeed,
Mrs. Lawrence would not have been separated from her son: so she and
Irene brought their worldly possessions over to Larch Avenue. The old
house was large enough. Sylvie was a courteous and charming mistress;
though Fred realized, with the sensitiveness of true tender love, the
burthen he had brought to her.

"It is not without its wise compensation," she said, tears in her sunny
brown eyes. "You see, I shall miss auntie so much less! She would not
desire me to grieve despairingly for her, and here is the new claim to
take her place. Beside," with a sad yet arch smile, "we shall have to
strive against the temptation to selfishness that besets newly married
people, when their pursuits are identical, as ours are. It will give a
greater breadth, a purer tone, to our lives."
