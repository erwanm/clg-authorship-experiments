" Oh yes, it will," returned Bartley, unabashed. 
" You 'll see ; it 'll come out all right." And in fact 
it did so, in the interview which Bartley printed. 

" Mr. Lapham," he wrote, " passed rapidly over the 
story of his early life, its poverty and its hardships, 
sweetened, however, by the recollections of a devoted 
mother, and a father who, if somewhat her inferior 
in education, was no less ambitious for the advance 
ment of his children. They were quiet, unpretentious 
people, religious, after the fashion of that time, and 
of sterling morality, and they taught their children 
the simple virtues of the Old Testament and Poor 
Richard's Almanac." 

Bartley could not deny himself this gibe ; but lie 
trusted to Lapham's unliterary habit of mind for his 
security in making it, and most other people would 
consider it sincere reporter's rhetoric. 

" You know, " he explained to Lapham, "that we 
have to look at all these facts as material, and we 
get the habit of classifying them. Sometimes a 
leading question will draw out a whole line of facts 
that a man himself would never think of." He 
went on to put several queries, and it was from 
Lapham's answers that he generalised the history of 
his childhood. " Mr. Lapham, although he did not 


dwell on his boyish trials and struggles, spoke of 
them with deep feeling and an abiding sense of their 
reality." This was what he added in the interview, 
and by the time he had got Lapham past the period 
where risen Americans are all pathetically alike in 
their narrow circumstances, their sufferings, and 
their aspirations, he had beguiled him into forget- 
fulness of the check he had received, and had him 
talking again in perfect enjoyment of his autobio 
graphy. 

"Yes, sir," said Lapham, in a strain which Bartley 
was careful not to interrupt again, " a man never 
sees all that his mother has been to him till it 's too 
late to let her know that he sees it. Why, my 

mother " he stopped. " It gives me a lump in 

the throat," he said apologetically, with an attempt 
at a laugh. Then he went on : " She was a little, 
frail thing, not bigger than a good-sized intermediate 
school-girl ; but she did the whole work of a family 
of boys, and boarded the hired men besides. She 
cooked, swept, washed, ironed, made and mended 
from daylight till dark and from dark till daylight, 
I was going to say ; for I don't know how she got 
any time for sleep. But I suppose she did. She 
got time to go to church, and to teach us to read 
the Bible, and to misunderstand it in the old way. 
She was good. But it ain't her on her knees in church 
that comes back to me so much like the sight of an 
angel as her on her knees before me at night, washing 
my poor, dirty little feet, that I 'd run bare in all 
day, and making me decent for bed. There were six 




of us boys ; it seems to me we were all of a size ; 
and she was just so careful with all of us. I can 
feel her hands on my feet yet !" Bartley looked at 
Lupham's No. 10 boots, and softly whistled through 
his teeth. " We were patched all over ; but we 
wa'n't ragged. I don't know how she got through 
it. She didn't seem to think it was anything ; and 
I guess it was no more than my father expected of 
her. He worked like a horse in doors and out up 
at daylight, feeding the stock, and groaning round 
all day with his rheumatism, but not stopping." 

Bartley hid a yawn over his note-book, and pro 
bably, if he could have spoken his mind, he would 
have suggested to Lapham that he was not there 
for the purpose of interviewing his ancestry. But 
Bartley had learned to practise a patience with his 
victims which he did not always feel, and to feign 
an interest in their digressions till he could bring 
them up with a round turn. 

"I tell you," said Lapham, jabbing the point of 
his penknife into the writing-pad on the desk before 
him, " when I hear women complaining nowadays 
that their lives are stunted and empty, I want to 
tell 'em about my nwtJiefs life. I could paint it out 
for 'em." 

Bartley saw his opportunity at the word paint, 
and cut in. " And you say, Mr. Lapham, that you 
discovered this mineral paint on the old farm your 
self?" 

Lapham acquiesced in the return to business. "I 
didn't discover it," he said scrupulously. " My 



 

father found it one day, in a hole made by a tree 
blowing down. There it was, lying loose in the pit, 
and sticking to the roots that had pulled up a big 
cake of dirt with 'em. I don't know what give him 
the idea that there was money in it, but he did 
think so from the start. I guess, if they 'd had the 
word in those days, they 'd considered him pretty 
much of a crank about it. He was trying as long 
as he lived to get that paint introduced ; but he 
couldn't make it go. The country was so poor they 
couldn't paint their houses with anything ; and father 
hadn't any facilities. It got to be a kind of joke
