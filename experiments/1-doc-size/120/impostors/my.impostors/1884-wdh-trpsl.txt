could reconcile herself at once to everything. "I 
shouldn't have liked it in her if she had. But time 
will bring it all right And if she really cares for 
you " 

" I extorted that from her." 

" Well, then, you must look at it in the best light 
you can. There is no blame anywhere, and the 
mortification and pain is something that must be 
lived down. That's all. And don't let what I 
said grieve you, Tom. You know I scarcely knew 
her, and I I shall be sure to like any one you like, 
after all" 

" Yes, I know," said the young man drearily. 
" Will you tell father ?" 

" If you wish." 

" He must know. And I couldn't stand any more 
of this, just yet any more mistake." 

" I will tell him," said Mrs. Corey ; and it was 
naturally the next thing for a woman who dwelt so 
much on decencies to propose : " We must go to call 
on her your sisters and I. They have never seen 
her even ; and she mustn't be allowed to think we 're 
indifferent to her, especially under the circumstances." 

" Oh no ! Don't go not yet," cried Corey, with 
an instinctive perception that nothing could be worse 
for him. "We must wait we must be patient. 
I 'm afraid it would be painful to her now." 

He turned away without speaking further; and 
his mother's eyes followed him wistfully to the door. 
There were some questions that she would have liked 



 

to ask him ; but she had to content herself with try 
ing to answer them when her husband put them to 
her. 

There was this comfort for her always in Brom- 
field Corey, that he never was much surprised at any 
thing, however shocking or painful. His standpoint 
in regard to most matters was that of the Sympa 
thetic humorist who would be glad to have the victim 
of circumstance laugh with him, but was not too 
much vexed when the victim could not. He laughed 
now when his wife, with careful preparation, got 
the facts of his son's predicament fully under his eye. 

" Really, Bromfield," she said, " I don't see how 
you can laugh. Do you see any way out of it ? " 

" It seems to me that the way has been found 
already. Tom has told his love 'to the right one, 
and the wrong one knows it. Time will do the 
rest." 

" If I had so low an opinion of them all as that, 
it would make me very unhappy. It 's shocking to 
think of it." 

"It is upon the theory of ladies and all young 
people," said her husband, with a shrug, feeling his 
way to the matches on the mantel, and then drop 
ping them with a sigh, as if recollecting that he must 
not smoke there. " I 've no doubt Tom feels him 
self an awful sinner. But apparently he 's resigned 
to his sin ; he isn't going to give her up." 

" I 'm glad to say, for the sake of human nature, 
that she isn't resigned little as I like her," cried 
Mrs. Corey. 



 

Her husband shrugged again. " Oh, there mustn't 
be any indecent haste. She will instinctively observe 
the proprieties. But come, now, Anna ! you mustn't 
pretend to me here, in the sanctuary of home, that 
practically the human affections don't reconcile them 
selves to any situation that the human sentiments 
condemn. Suppose the wrong sister had died : 
would the right one have had any scruple in marry 
ing Tom, after they had both ' waited a proper time,' 
as the phrase is ? " 

" Bromfield, you 're shocking ! " 

" Not more shocking than reality. You may regard 
this as a second marriage." He looked at her with 
twinkling eyes, full of the triumph the spectator of 
his species feels in signal exhibitions of human 
nature. " Depend upon it, the right sister will be 
reconciled ; the wrong one will be consoled ; and all 
will go merry as a marriage bell a second marriage 
bell. Why, it 's quite like a romance ! " Here he 
laughed outright again. 

" Well," sighed the wife, " I could almost wish 
the right one, as you call her, would reject Tom, 
I dislike her so much." 

"Ah, now you're talking business, Anna," said 
her husband, with his hands spread behind the back
