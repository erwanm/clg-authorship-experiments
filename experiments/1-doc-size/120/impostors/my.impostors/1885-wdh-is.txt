ache." 

"Oh, that's all gone," said Mrs. Bowen. "It 
was one of those convenient headaches — if you ever 
had them, you'd know — that go off at sunset." 
" But you'd have another to-morrow.'' 
" No, I 'm safe for a whole fortnight from another." 
" Then you leave me without an excuse, and I 
was just wishing I had none," said Colville. 

After dinner Mrs. Bowen sent Effie to bed early 
to make up for the late hours of the night before, 
but she sat before the fire with Miss Graham rather 
late, talking Colville over, when he was gone. 

" He 's very puzzling to me," said Miss Graham. 
" Sometimes you think he 's nothing but an old 
cynic, from his talk, and then something so sweet 
and fresh comes out that you don't know what to 
do. Don't you think he has really a very poetical 
mind, and that he 's putting all the rest on ? " 

" I think he likes to make little effects," said Mrs. 
Bowen judiciously. " He always did, rather." 
" Why, was he like this when he was young ? " 
" I don't consider him very old now." 
" No, of course not. I meant when you knew 
him before." Miss Graham had some needlework 
in her hand ; Mrs. Bowen, who never even pretended 



to work at that kind of thing, had nothing in hers 
hut the feather .screen.  

"He is old, compared with you, Imogene hut 
you 'll find, as you live along, that your contemporaries are always young. Mr. Colville is very much 
improved. He used to be painfully shy, but he put 
on a bold front, and now the bold front seems to 
have become a second nature with him." 

" I like it," said Miss Graham, to her needle. 

" Yes ; but I suspect he 's still shy, at heart. He 
used to be very sentimental, and was always talking 
Euskin. I think if he hadn't talked Euskin so 
much, Jenny Milbury might have treated him better. 
It was very priggish in him." 

" Oh, I can't imagine Mr. Colville's being priggish ! " 

" He 's very much improved. He used to be 
quite a sloven in his dress; you know how very 
slovenly most American gentlemen are in their 
dress, at any rate. I think that influenced her 
against him too." 

"He isn't lovenly now," suggested Miss Graham. 

" Oh no ; he 's quite swell," said Mrs. Bowen, 
depriving the adjective of slanginess by the refinement of her tone. 

"Well," said Miss Graham, "I don't see how 
you could have endured her after that. It was 
atrocious." 

" It was better for her to break with him, if she 
found out she didn't love him, than to marry him. 
That," said Mrs. Bowen, with a depth of feeling 



 

uncommon for her, " would have been a thousand 
times wprse." 

" Yes, but she ought to have found out before she 
led him on so far." 

" Sometimes girls can't. They don't know them- 
selves ; they think they 're in love when they 're 
not. She was very impulsive, and of course she 
was flattered by it ; he was so intellectual. But at 
last she found that she couldn't bear it, and she had 
to tell him so." 

"Did she ever say why she didn't love him ? " 

" No ; I don't suppose she could. The only thing 
I remember her saying was that he was ' too much 
of a mixture.'" 

"What did she mean by that ? " 

" I don't know exactly." 

"Do you think he 's insincere ? " 

" Oh no. Perhaps she meant that he wasn't single- 
minded." 

" Fickle ? " 

" No. He certainly wasn't that in her case." 

" Undecided ?' 

" He was decided enough with her — at last." 

Imogene dropped the hopeless quest, " How can a 
man ever stand such a thing ? " she sighed. 

" He stood it very nobly. That was the best 
thing about it ; he took it- in the most delicate way. 
She showed me his letter. There wasn't a word or 
a hint of reproach in it ; he seemed to be anxious 
about nothing but her feeling badly for him. Of 
course he couldn't help showing that he was morti-
