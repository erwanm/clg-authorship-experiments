Then later, when she charged Cauchon with trying to 
kill her with a poisoned fish, her notion that she was to be 
' delivered' by death in the prison— if she had it, and I 


believe she had — would naturally be greatly strengthened, 
you see. 

But I am wandering from the trial. Joan was asked to 
definitely name the time that she would be delivered from 
prison. 

' I have always said that I was not permitted to tell you 
everything. I am to be set free, and I desire to ask leave 
of my Voices to tell you the day. This is why I wish for 
delay.' 

' Do your Voices forbid you to tell the truth ? ' 

' Is it that you wish to know matters concerning the 
King of France ? I tell you again that he will regain his 
kingdom, and that I know it as well as I know that you 
sit here before me in this tribunal.' She sighed, and after 
a little pause, added : ' I should be dead but for this re- 
velation, which comforts me always.' 

Some trivial questions were asked her about St. 
Michael's dress and appearance. She answered them with 
dignity, but one saw that they gave her pain. After a 
little she said — 

" ' I have great joy in seeing him, for when I see him I 
have the feeling that I am not in mortal sin.' She added, 
' Sometimes St. Marguerite and St. Catherine have allowed 
me to confess myself to them.' 

Here was a possible chance to set a successful snare for 
her innocence. 

' When you confessed were you in mortal sin, do you 
think?' 

But her reply did her no hurt. So the inquiry was 
shifted once more to the revelations made to the King — 
secrets which the court had tried again and again to force 
out of Joan, but without success. 

' Now as to the sign given to the King ' 

' I have already told you that I will tell you nothing 
about it.' 

' Do you know what the sign was ? ' 

' As to that you will not find out from me.' 

All this refers to Joan's secret Interview with the King 
— held apart, though two or three others were present. 
It was known — through Loyseleur, of course — that this 
sign was a crown and was a pledge of the verity of Joan's 
mission. But that is all a mystery until this day — the 
nature of the crown, I mean — and will remain a mystery 
to the end of time. We can never know whether a real 
crown descended upon the King's head, or only a symbol, 
the mystic fabric of a vision. 

' Did you see a crown upon the King's head when he 
received the revelation ? ' 

' I cannot tell you as to that without perjury.' • 

' Did the King have that crown at Rheims ? ' 

' I think the King- put upon his head a crown which he 
found there ; but a much richer one was brought him after- 
wards.' 

' Have you seen that one ? ' 

' I cannot tell you without perjury. But whether I 
have seen it or not, I have heard say that it was rich and 
magnificent.' 

They went on and pestered her to weariness about that 
mysterious crown, but they got nothing more out of her. 
The sitting closed. A long, hard day for all of us. 



CHAPTER X 

The court rested a day, then took up work again on Satur- 
day the third of March. 

This was one of our stormiest sessions. The whole 
court was out of patience ; and with good reason. These 
three-score distinguished churchmen, illustrious tacticians, 
veteran legal gladiators, had left important posts where 
their supervision was needed, to journey hither from various 
regions and accomplish a most simple and easy matter — 
condemn and send to death a country lass of nineteen who 
could neither read nor write, knew nothing of the wiles 

and perplexities of legal procedure, could call not a single 
witness in her defence, was allowed no advocate or adviser, 
and must conduct her case by herself against a hostile 
judge and a packed jury. In two hours she would be 
hopelessly entangled, routed, defeated, convicted. No- 
thing could be more certain than this — so they thought. 
But it was a mistake. The two hours had strung out into 
days ; what promised to be a skirmish had expanded into 
a siege ; the thing which had looked so easy had proven 
to be surprisingly difficult ; the light victim who was to 
have been puffed away like a feather remained planted like 
a rock ; and on top of all this, if anybody had a right to 
laugh, it was the country lass and not the court. 

She was not doing that, for that was not her spirit ; 
but others were doing it. The whole town was laughing 
in its sleeve, and the court knew it, and its dignity was
