in that position is no compliment." 

" I did n't say I was thinking well ! " Acton af- 
firmed, smiling. 

She looked at him, and then she turned away. 
" Though I didn't come to see you," she said, "re- 
member at least that I am within your gates." 

" I am delighted I am honored ! Won't you 
come into the house ? " 

" I have just come out of it. I have been call- 



 

ing upon your mother. I have been bidding her 
farewell." 

" Farewell ? " Acton demanded. 

" I am going away," said the Baroness. And 
she turned away again, as if to illustrate her mean- 
ing. 

"When are you going?" asked Acton, standing 
a moment in his place. But the Baroness made 
no answer, and he followed her. 

" I came this way to look at your garden," she 
said, walking back to the gate, over the grass, 
" But I must go." 

" Let me at least go with you." He went with 
her, and they said nothing till they reached the 
gate. It was open, and they looked down the 
road which was darkened over with long bosky 
shadows. " Must you go straight home ? " Acton 
asked. 

But she made no answer. She said, after a mo- 
ment, " Why have you not been to see me ? " 
He said nothing, and then she went on, " Why 
don't you answer me ? " 

" I am trying to invent an answer," Acton con- 
fessed. 

" Have you none ready ? " 

" None that I can tell you," he said. " But let 
me walk with you now." 

" You may do as you like." 



   

She moved slowly along the road, and Acton 
went with her. Presently he said, " If I had done 
as I liked I would have corne to see you several 
times." 

" Is that invented ? " asked Eugenia. 

" No, that is natural. I stayed away because " 

" Ah, here comes the reason, then ! " 

" Because I wanted to think about you." 

" Because you wanted to lie down ! " said the 
Baroness. " I have seen you lie down almost 
in my drawing-room." 

Acton stopped in the road, with a movement 
which seemed to beg her to linger a little. She 
paused, and he looked at her awhile ; he thought 
her very charming. " You are jesting," he said ; 
"but if you are really going away it is very 
serious." 

" If I stay," and she gave a little laugh, " it is 
more serious still ! " 

" When shall you go ? " 

" As soon as possible." 

" And why ? " 

" Why should I stay ? " 

" Because we all admire you so." 

" That is not a reason. I am admired also in 
Europe." And she began to walk homeward 
again. 

" What could I say to keep you ? " asked Acton. 



 

He wanted to keep her, and it was a fact that he 
had been thinking of her for a week. He was in 
love with her now ; he was conscious of that, or 
lie thought he was; and the only question with 
him was whether he could trust her. 

" What you can say to keep me? " she repeated. 
'As I want very much to go it is not in my in- 
terest to tell you. Besides, I can't imagine." 

He went on with her in silence ; he was much 
more affected by what she had told him than ap-
