side pocket. Underneath it his heart beat fast 
and high; he was young and he was free — the 
open road stretched out before him, and perpetual 
adventure beckoned to him. Every pilgrimage 
that he had ever read of helped to make up the 
thrill that stirred him, as he stood on the ridge 
and gazed at the old farmhouse, and waved his 
hand, and turned and began his journey. 

The horse was needed for the plowing, and so 
Samuel walked the six miles to the village, and 
from there the mail stage took him out to the soli- 
tary railroad station. He had three hours to 
wait here for the train, and so he decided that he 
would save fifteen cents by walking on to the next 
station. Distance was nothing to Samuel just 
then. 

Halfway to his destination there was a fire in 
a little clearing by the track, and a yoxmg man 
sat toasting some bread on a stick. 

" Hello ! " he said. " You're hittin' her Hvely." 

" Yes," said Samuel. The stranger was not 


mucH older than he, but his clothing was dirty 
and he had a dissipated, leering face. 

" You're new at this game, aren't you? " said 
he. 

" What game? " asked Samuel, 

The other laughed. " Where ye goin'? " 

" To New York." 

" Goin' to hoof it all the way? " 

" Nol " gasped the boy. " I'm just walking 
to the next station." 

" Oh, I see! What's the fare? " 

" Six thirty-seven, I think." 

" Humph! Got the price, hey! " 

" Yes — I've got the price." Samuel said this 
without pride. 

" Well, you won't have it long if you live at 
that rate," commented the stranger, " Why 
don't you beat your way? " 

" How do you mean? " asked Samuel. 

" Nobody but a duffer pays fare," said the 
other. " There'll be a freight along pretty soon, 
and she stops at the water tank just below here. 
Why don't you jump her? " 

Samuel hesitated, " I wouldn't hke to do 
that," he said. 

" Come," said the other, " sit down," 

And he held out a piece of his toast, which Sam- 
uel accepted for pohteness' sake. This young fel- 
low had nm away from school at the age of 





thirteen; and he had traveled all over the United 
States, following the seasons, and Living off the 
country. He was on his way now from a win- 
ter's holiday in Mexico. And as Samuel hstened 
to the tale of his adventm-es, he could not keep 
the thought from troubling him, how large a 
part of eighty dollars was six thirty-seven. And 
all in a single day. 

" Come," said the young fellow; and they start- 
ed down the track. The freight was whistling 
for brakes, far up the grade. And Samuel's 
heart thumped with excitement. 

They crouched in the bushes, not far beyond 
the tank. But the train did not stop for water; 
it only slowed down for a curve, and it thimdered 
by at what seemed to Samuel an appalling rate 
of speed. " Jump ! " shouted the other, and 
started to run by the track. He made a leap, and 
caught, and was whirled on, half visible in a cloud 
of dust. 

Samuel's nerve failed him. He waited, while 
car after car went by. But then he caught hold 
of himself. If anyone could do it, so could he. 
For shame. 

He started to nm. There came a box-car, 
empty, with the door open, and he leaped and 
clutched the edge of the door. He was whirled 
from his feet, his arms were nearly jerked out 
of him. He was half blinded by the dust, but he 





hung on desperately, and pvdled himself up. A 
minute more and he lay gasping and trembling 
upon the floor of the car. Jle was on his way to 
the city.
