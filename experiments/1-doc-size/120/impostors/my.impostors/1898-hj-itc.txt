that consisted of an almost humourous treat 
ment of the look of some of his words. They 
would never perhaps have grown half so 
intimate if he had not, by the blessing of 
heaven, formed some of his letters with a 
queerness ! It was positive that the queer- 
ness could scarce have been greater if he 
had practised it for the very purpose of bring 
ing their heads together over it as far as was 
possible to heads on different sides of a cage. 
It had taken her in reality but once or 
twice to master these tricks, but, at the cost 
of striking him perhaps as stupid, she could 





still challenge them when circumstances 
favoured. The great circumstance that 
favoured was that she sometimes actually 
believed he knew she only feigned perplex 
ity. If he knew it, therefore, he tolerated 
it; if he tolerated it he came back; and if 
he came back he liked her. This was her 
seventh heaven ; and she didn' t ask much of 
his liking she only asked of it to reach the 
point of his not going away because of her 
own. He had at times to be away for 
weeks; he had to lead his life; he had to 
travel there were places to which he was 
constantly wiring for rooms : all this she 
granted him, forgave him; in fact, in the 
long run, literally blessed and thanked him 
for. If he had to lead his life, that pre 
cisely fostered his leading it so much by 
telegraph : therefore the benediction was to 
come in when he could. That was all she 
asked that he shouldn't wholly deprive her. 
Sometimes she almost felt that he couldn't 
have done so even had he been minded, on 
account of the web of revelation that was 





woven between them. She quite thrilled 
herself with thinking what, with such a lot 
of material, a bad girl would do. It would 
be a scene better than many in her ha penny 
novels, this going to him in the dusk of 
evening at Park Chambers and letting him 
at last have it. I know too much about a 
certain person now not to put it to you 
excuse my being so lurid that it 's quite 
worth your while to buy me off. Come, 
therefore, buy me! There was a point 
indeed at which such flights had to drop 
again the point of an unreadiness to name, 
when it came to that, the purchasing 
medium. It wouldn t, certainly, be any 
thing so gross as money, and the matter 
accordingly remained rather vague, all the 
more that she was not a bad girl. It was 
not for any such reason as might have 
aggravated a mere minx that she often 
hoped he would again bring Cissy. The 
difficulty of this, however, was constantly 
present to her, for the kind of communion 
to which Cocker 's so richly ministered rested 





on the fact that Cissy and he were so often 
in different places. She knew by this time 
all the places Suchbury, Monkhouse, White - 
roy, Finches and even how the parties, on 
these occasions, were composed; but her 
subtlety found ways to make her knowledge 
fairly protect and promote their keeping, as 
she had heard Mrs. Jordan say, in touch. 
So, when he actually sometimes smiled as 
if he really felt the awkwardness of giving 
her again one of the same old addresses, all 
her being went out in the desire which her 
face must have expressed that he should 
recognise her forbearance to criticise as one 
of the finest, tenderest sacrifices a woman 
had ever made for love.

She was occasionally worried, all the 
same, by the impression that these sacrifices, 
great as they were, were nothing to those 
that his own passion had imposed ; if indeed 
it was not rather the passion of his confed 
erate, which had caught him up and was 
whirling him round like a great steam-wheel. 
He was at any rate in the strong grip of a 
dizzy, splendid fate ; the wild wind of his life 
blew him straight before it. Didn't she 
catch in his face, at times, even through 
his smile and his happy habit, the gleam of 
that pale glare with which a bewildered 
victim appeals, as he passes, to some pair 
of pitying eyes? He perhaps didn' t even 
himself know how scared he was; but she 
knew. They were in danger, they were in 
danger, Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen : 
it beat every novel in the shop. She 

thought of Mr. Mudge and his safe senti-
