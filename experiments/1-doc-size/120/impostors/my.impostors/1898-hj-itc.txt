scendent and distilled had ever been estab 
lished on earth. Everything, so far as they 
chose to consider it so, might mean almost 
anything. The want of margin in the cage, 
when he peeped through the bars, wholly 
ceased to be appreciable. It was a drawback 
only in superficial commerce. With Captain 
Everard she had simply the margin of the 
universe. It may be imagined, therefore, 
how their unuttered reference to all she 
knew about him could, in this immensity, 
play at its ease. Every time he handed in 
a telegram it was an addition to her knowl 
edge : what did his constant smile mean to 
mark if it didn' t mean to mark that? He 





never came into the place without saying to 
her in this manner: Oh yes, you have me 
by this time so completely at your mercy 
that it doesn' t in the least matter what I 
give you now. You've become a comfort, I 
assure you! 

She had only two torments ; the greatest 
of which was that she couldn t, not even 
once or twice, touch with him on some indi 
vidual fact. She would have given anything 
to have been able to allude to one of his 
friends by name, to one of his engagements 
by date, to one of his difficulties by the solu 
tion. She would have given almost as much 
for just the right chance it would have 
to be tremendously right to show him in 
some sharp, sweet way that she had perfectly 
penetrated the greatest of these last and now 
lived with it in a kind of heroism of sym 
pathy. He was in love with a woman to 
whom, and to any view of whom, a lady- 
telegraphist, and especially one who passed 
a life among hams and cheeses, was as the 
sand on the floor; and what her dreams 





desired was the possibility of it somehow 
coming to him that her own interest in him 
could take a pure and noble account of such 
an infatuation and even of such an impro 
priety. As yet, however, she could only rub 
along with the hope that an accident, sooner 
or later, might give her a lift toward pop 
ping out with something that would surprise 
and perhaps even, some fine day, assist him. 
What could people mean, moreover 
cheaply sarcastic people by not feeling all 
that could be got out of the weather? She 
felt it all, and seemed literally to feel it 
most when she went quite wrong, speaking 
of the stuffy days as cold, of the cold ones 
as stuffy, and betraying how little she knew, 
in her cage, of whether it was foul or fair. 

It was, for that matter, always stuffy at 
Cocker's, and she finally settled down to the 
safe proposition that the outside element was 
changeable. Anything seemed true that 
made him so radiantly assent. 

This indeed is a small specimen of her 
cultivation of insidious ways of making 








things easy for him ways to which of course 
she couldn't be at all sure that he did real 
justice. Real justice was not of this world: 
she had had too often to come back to that ; 
yet, strangely, happiness was, and her traps 
had to be set for it in a manner to keep them 
unperceived by Mr. Buckton and the coun 
ter-clerk. The most she could hope for apart 
from the question, which constantly flick 
ered up and died down, of the divine chance 
of his consciously liking her, would be that, 
without analysing it, he should arrive at a 
vague sense that Cocker 's was well, attrac 
tive; easier, smoother, sociably brighter, 
slightly more picturesque, in short more pro 
pitious in general to his little affairs, than 
any other establishment just thereabouts. 
She was quite aware that they couldn't be, 
in so huddled a hole, particularly quick ; but 
she found her account in the slowness sh^ 
certainly could bear it if he could. The 
great pang was that, just thereabouts, post- 
offices were so awfully thick. She was 
always seeing him, in imagination, in other 





places and with other girls. But she would 
defy any other girl to follow him as she fol 
lowed. And though they weren t, for so 
many reasons, quick at Cocker's, she could 
hurry for him when, through an intimation 
light as air, she gathered that he was 
pressed.
