beaten cur — you kicked me — you spit upon me! 
And it was every bit of it a lie! That insolent 
rage of yours — why, it wasn't even genuine! 


You weren't even angry — you knew that you 
had no reason to be angry — that you had treated 
me as if I were a worm to tread on! And yet 
you stood there and abused me! 

Oh — why, the thing is madness to think of! 
It is more madness the more you reahze it ! I 
have never known anything like it before in 
my Hfe. 

Yes — actually — it is something quite new to 
me. I have met blind people — people who would 
not heed me — but a really evil person I have 
never known before! A person who has no re- 
spect for another's rights — who would trample 
upon another! Oh, you miserable wretch — and 
the lies — the lies! The hateful sneaking of it — 
you black-hearted, insolent man! The manu- 
script had been there all the time! The delays, 
the routine! And you had sent your secretary 
down to inquire ! And above all — oh, above all — 
the prince of them — I must not go near there 
lest I should injure myself! I must not go near 
them — they were so weary of seeing me ! And I 
never saw a single soul there in my life but one 
clerk! 

I never suffered such a thing as this before in 
all my days — deliberate, brutal injustice! And 


that I should be so placed as to be a victim of 
such a thing — that I should have to hang upon 
your words and to be at your mercy for eleven 
weeks of agony ! You are a great editor, a club- 
man, a rich man ! You have fame and power and 
wealth — and you stand up there and scald me 
with your rage — and with your heart a mess of 
lies all the time! 

— But why did you do it? That is the thing 
I ask myself in consternation. Why? Why? — 
Were you not interested in my work? If you 
weren't — why didn't you give it back to me, and 
let me go my way? And if you were — if you had 
any idea of publishing it — then why did you use 
me in this way? Where was the manuscript all 
this time? What did you mean to do with it? 
How long did you expect me to wait? And what 
object did you have in telling me untruths about 
it meanwhile? 

— The whole thing is as blank to me as night. 
That a man should have in him so much infinite 
indifiference about another as to leave that manu- 
script in a drawer, and write me that I was to 
"have a report on it within a week"! Why, 
it is something of which I can not even think. 


And then to get out of it by that sham anger and 
that sneaking! — 

April 2oth. 
I have done absolutely nothing but brood 
over this thing and rage all day. What am I to 
do? — I sat and wondered if there was anything I 
could do but go and shoot that man. And I 
asked myself: Ought I not at least to go and get 
the manuscript from that accursed place this in- 
stant? Ought I not to have taken it then and 
there? But see the utter misery of my situation, 
the abject shame of it — suppose they were to take 
the thing! It is my one hope in this world — I 
dare not lose it — I have to leave it there! 

But then, what hope is there now? I ask. 
Why, he was going to urge it upon them! And 
now, of course, he's simply sent it in there with- 
out a word! 

Don't you see what it was — it was that let- 
ter of inquiry they wrote him! He paid no more 
attention to me than if I were a hound; but he 
had to send it when they wrote! And perhaps 
they said something about carelessness and that 
made him wild. 

Oh, the thing is an endless spring of gall to 



me! I am all raw with it — I have to rush out 
on the street and walk away my passion. I never 
saw my situation so plainly — the horrible impo- 
tence of it! Just see what I struggle against, 
the utter insane futility of everything I do! 
Why, I beat my wings in a void, I hammer my 
head against a wall ! 

— And now I must wait for that thing to 
come back — don't I know that it will come back? 
And don't I know that that will be the end of me? 

A black, horrible gloom has settled down 
upon me. I am utterly lost in despair. 

April 2 1 St. 
I will write no more about that man — my 
whole being is turned to bitterness. I wonder at 
myself — I have no longer one feeling left in this 
world except a black brooding hatred of him! 

— And all the time the thing haunts me like 
a detective story — I can't find the solution!
