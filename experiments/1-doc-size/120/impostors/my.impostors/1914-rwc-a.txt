cheek against the fur of his coat, his arm extended along the back of
the chair behind her.
"Well," he said, "this has been another happy evening."
She stirred in assent, and he felt the lightest possible pressure
against him.
"Are you contented, Athalie?"
"Yes."
After a moment he glanced at his watch. It was three o'clock. So he
rose, placed the screen over the fireplace, and then came back to
where she now stood, looking very intently at the opposite wall. And
he turned to see what interested her. But there seemed to be nothing
in particular just there.
"What are you staring at, little ghost-seer?" he asked, passing his
hand under her arm; and stepped back, surprised, as she freed herself
with a quick, nervous movement, looked at him, then averted her head.
"What is the matter, Athalie?" he inquired.
"Nothing.... Don't touch me, Clive."
"No, of course not.... But what in the world--"
"Nothing.... Don't ask me." Presently he saw her very slowly move her
head and look back at the empty corner of the room; and remain so,
motionless for a moment. Then she turned with a sigh, came quietly to
him; and he drew her hand through his arm.
"Of what were you thinking, Athalie?"
"Of nothing."
"Did you think you saw something over there?"
She was silent.
"What were you looking at?" he insisted.
"Nothing.... I don't care to talk just now--"
"Tell me, Athalie!"
"No.... No, I don't want to, Clive--"
"I wish to know!"
"I can't--there is nothing to tell you--" she laid one hand on his
coat, almost pleadingly, and looked up at him out of eyes so dark
that only the starry light in them betrayed that they were blue and
not velvet black.
"That same thing has happened before," he said, looking at her, deeply
perplexed. "Several times since I have known you the same expression
has come into your face--as though you were looking at something
which--"
"Please don't, Clive!--"
"--Which," he insisted, "I did not see.... Could not see!"
"Clive!"
He stared at her rather blankly: "Why don't you tell me?"
"I--can't!"
"Is there anything--"
"Don't! Don't!" she begged; but he went on, still staring at her:
"Is there any reason for you to--not to be frank with me? Is there,
Athalie?"
"No; no reason.... I'll tell you ... if you will understand. Must I
tell you?"
"Yes."
Her head fell; she stood plucking nervously at his fur coat for a
while in silence. Then:
"Clive, I--I see clearly."
"What?"
"I mean that I see a--a little more clearly than--some do. Do you
understand?"
"No."
She sighed, stood twisting her white-gloved fingers, looking away from
him.
"I am clairvoyant," she breathed.
"Athalie! You?"
She nodded.
For a second or two he stood silent in his astonishment; then, taking
her hand, he drew her around facing the light, and she looked up at
him in her lovely abashed way, yet so honestly, that anybody who could
recognise truth and candour, could never have mistaken such eyes as
hers.
"Who told you that you are clairvoyant?" he asked.
"My mother."
"Then--"
"It was not necessary for anybody to tell me that I saw--more
clearly--than other people.... Mother knew it.... She merely explained
and gave a name to this--this--whatever it is--this quality--this
ability to see clearly.... That is all, Clive."
He was evidently trying to comprehend and digest what she had said.
She watched him, saw surprise and incredulity in conflict with
uneasiness and with the belief he could not avoid from lips that were
not fashioned for lies, and from eyes never made to even look
untruths.
"I had never supposed there was such a thing as real clairvoyance," he
said at last.
She remained silent, her candid gaze on him.
"I believe that you believe it, of course."
She smiled, then sighed:
"There is no pleasure in it to me. I wish it were not so."
"But, if it is so, you ought to find it--interesting--"
"No."
"Why not? I should think you would!--if you can see--things--that
other people cannot."
"I don't care to see them."
"Why?"
"They--I see them so often--and I seldom know who they are--"
"They?"
"The--people--I see."
"Don't they ever speak to you?"
"Seldom."
"Could you find out who they are?"
"I don't know.... Yes, I think so;--if I made an effort."
"Don't you ever use any effort to evoke--"
"Oh, Clive! No! When I tell you I had rather not see so--so
clearly--"
"You dear girl!" he exclaimed, half smiling, half serious, "why should
it distress you?"
"It doesn't--except to talk about it."
"Let me ask one more question. May I?"
She nodded.
"Then--did you recognise whoever it was you saw a few moments ago?"
"Yes."
"Who was it, Athalie?"
"My mother."
CHAPTER X
Early in April C. Bailey, Jr., overdrew his account, was politely
notified of that oversight by the bank. He hunted about, casually, for
stray funds, but to his intense surprise discovered nothing
immediately available.
Which annoyed him, and he explained the situation to his father; who
demanded further and sordidly searching explanations concerning the
expenditure on his son's part of an income more than adequate for any
unmarried young man.
