most amazing theft that the history of
philosophy has known. It has stolen from the 
lips of the Carpenter's Son the principles of 

human progress, over which a little knot of 
scholars and scoffers are grouped to-day, with 
the expression of those who discover the se- 
cret of existence. These principles, and these 
alone, present the only possible chance for the 
development of the race from its existing 
crudeness to the beautiful finish of which ma- 
terialist and believer dream. The theories of 
the New Testament contain the seeds of the 
highest because the broadest culture. They 
respect the people. They build our hospitals, 
our asylums, our Magdalen homes, our public 
schools, the scholarships in our great universi- 
ties ; they open the oriental harems to our fe- 
male physicians, our libraries to day-laborers, 
our academies to freed slaves, our colleges to 
women, our republics to their citizens. Blot 
the philosophy of the Nazarene out of the 
world, and these things go with it. This phi- 
losophy, and this alone, places that importance 
on the individual which makes personal growth 
possible upon any such scale as to become gen- 
eral development. 

Jesus Christ taught the value of the unit; 
he gave us this factor in social statics. He 
represented the enfranchisement of faith ; he 




gave this basis to our spiritual science. Strive 
as we would, we can no more outgrow our 
debt to him as a social reformer, or the chief 
apostle of religious freedom, than the wine can 
disallow its own grapes, or the rainbow ignore 
the prism. " Let mental culture go on ad- 
vancing," admitted Goethe, " let the natural 
sciences go on gaining in depth and breadth, 
and the human mind expand as it may, it will 
never go beyond the elevation and moral culture 
of Christianity as it glistens and shines 
forth in the Gospel ! " 

The remarkable conformity of the Scriptures 
to personal consciousness and to universal 
history is an important argument in 
favor of the reality of the Biblical claims, but 
does not seem to be a final one. Let it meet 
the individual or the general needs with what- 
ever force or subtlety, the demands of this 
Book are so tremendous, if false they are so 
preposterous, that it ought to be subjected to 
every test of intellect and conscience that we 
can bring to bear upon it. 

If we can find anything else professing to 
be a revelation from God which is less perplexing,
more simple, more reasonable, we 

should be bound to drop this. " Give me a 
better book, and I will," was the profound 
reply of a Christian who was asked to surrender 
the Bible. 

Candid unbelievers readily acknowledge the 
superiority of the Christian to all other Scriptures.
Uncandid ones admit the same by the 
virulence and persistence of their defiance to 
the Bible. 

" There is no recognition in the Koran of 
human brotherhood." Many orientalists claim 
that Buddhism gives us no personal god. The 
Edda, and the Zend Avesta, and the Vedas 
have too many gods. The Sacred Books of 
Confucius offer little or no hope of immortality. 
It is not too much to say that, on the 
whole, and to the best of our knowledge and 
belief, tested by that consensus of the intelligent 
and devout which alone is competent to 
pass judgment upon a question in which the 
spiritual faculties as well as the reasoning 
must be qualified jurors, our Bible reveals the 
best explanation we have of the phenomena 
of life. 

It is a mysterious one, it is an imperfect 
one, it is a half-developed one, but it is the 

best we have. It is the best we have, because 
it is the most humane ; therefore, in so far, 
the most divine. It is the most humane and 
the most divine because it reveals the rela- 
tion of Jesus Christ to the problem of exist- 
ence. 

To practical people of instructed intelli- 
gence, but not of the theological or metaphys- 
ical temperaments which will amuse them- 
selves with the casuistries of the thing to the 
end of human leisure, it seems to me that the 
whole matter resolves itself into something like 
this : 

We are here, we know not how or why. 
We are in a world of certain misery and 
uncertain pleasure. Life is a dark marvel. 
Death is a blind leap. The future is silent. 
God is a mystery. Nature is terrible. Why 
are we thrust, the pawns in an awful game ? 
Why, why were we tossed, the weeds on a 
fathomless sea ? What did the Creator of the 
earth mean by so seemingly cruel a waste of 
human sensitiveness and force ? Who can find 
him reasons for an apparently merciless venture
