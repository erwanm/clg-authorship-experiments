presence which was coming; she did not dread 
to look upon it. The light that, sliding from 
window to window, still flooded the bed, made 
the face of Peace, even then, less like the face 
of death than like the pictured saint. 

As Gypsy knelt there on the floor through 
the long hours, awed and still, watching for 
Peace to waken, she did not wonder any more 
that Peace could smile when she was going 
to die. 

Her dream of the night came back to her 
suddenly. She saw again, as vividly as if she 
had lived it through, the warm waves of Galilee, 
the line of gold ; she heard the voice upon the 
shore, and saw the Figure with its hand upraised. 
And suddenly it came to her what 
dying meant to Peace, — all the freedom and 
the strength and the rest from pain. 

The thought was in her heart when Peace 
awoke at last, conscious and quiet. It was at 


the end of the afternoon, and the light was 
stealing into the west. They were all gone 
now but Aunt Jane and herself. 

“ Peace,” said her aunt, gently, “ Peace, 
dear.” 

But Peace, in her joy at seeing Gypsy there, 
saw nothing and heard nothing besides. Aunt 
Jane shrank back; she deserved it, and she 
knew it, but it was a little hard, now when she 
might — who knows? — have asked in death 
forgiveness for that which she had done and 
left undone to make life bitter. 

“ Gypsy, you here yet? Oh, I am very glad.” 

Gypsy cfept up on the bed. 

“ Right here, close by you. Peace.” 

“ I want to tell you something, Gypsy ; I 
want to say you have been so good, — so good 
to me. And don’t you think I ’m going to forget 
it now, and don’t think I ’m going to forget you. 
Why, I shall thank Him for you one of the 
very first things.” 

At the voice and at the words, Gypsy’s cour- 
age gave way. 


“ Oh, Peace ! oh, Peace ! what shall I do 
without you? What shall I dof and could 
say no more for sobbing, and Peace took her 
clinging hand and drew it up beside her cheek, 
and so they lay and said no word ; and the 
stealing light gathered itself upon the hills, and 
the night came on. 

All at once Peace turned, and took away her 
hand, and pointed at the wall. 

“ See, Gypsy, — why, see ! ” 

Gypsy looked up. Upon the wall, close by 
the bed, the illuminated text was hanging that 
had been her Christmas gift to Peace over a year 
ago. Flashes of crimson thrown from the 
west hung trembling over it and framed in 
and transfigured the blue and golden words : 

“ the mbnbi'tant shall not say I am si'dt.” 

“ Oh, Gypsy, Gypsy, how nice it will be ! ” 

“Yes, dear,” and Gypsy stopped her sobbing. 

“To walk about, and run, and not have any 
pain, — why, think of not having any pain, 
Gypsy ! ” 



“ Yes, dear.” 

“ Kiss me, Gypsy.” 

Gypsy kissed her, and the flush of crimson 
faded from the blue and golden words, and the 
twilight fell into its place. 

” She ’s dropped into another nap,” said Aunt 
Jane, coming up, turning her stern face away 
so that Gypsy should not see, in the dark, the 
hot, fast-dropping tears. So they sat awhile in 
the dusk together. Aunt Jane moving the great 
white fan dimly to and fro on the other side of 
the bed, and Gypsy crouched among the pil- 
lows watching it, watching the face of Peace, 
watching the blackness gather in the room. 

Presently the doctor came in. 

“ She may hold out till morning, after all, 
sir,” whispered Aunt Jane; “she’s having a 
long nap now. I hope she will last a little 
longer, for I ’ve got something to say to her. I 
meant to say it, I meant to say it. I ’ll light 
the lamp, sir.” 

She lighted the lamp ; she went up to the 
bed, holding it and shading her eyes.
