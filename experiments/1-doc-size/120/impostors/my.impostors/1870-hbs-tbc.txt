  Because not altogether of such clay
  As rots into the soul of those whom I survey?

         *       *       *       *       *

  'From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy,
  Have I not seen what human things could do,--
  From the loud roar of foaming calumny,
  To the small whispers of the paltry few,
  And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
  The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
  Learning to lie with silence, would seem true,
  And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
  Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy?'[12]

[Footnote 12: The italics are mine.]

The reader will please notice that the lines in italics are almost,
word for word, a repetition of the lines in italics in the former poem
on his wife, where he speaks of a significant eye that has learned
to lie in silence, and were evidently meant to apply to Lady Byron and
her small circle of confidential friends.

Before this, in the Third Canto of 'Childe Harold,' he had claimed the
sympathy of the world, as a loving father, deprived by a severe fate of
the solace and society of his only child:--

  'My daughter,--with this name my song began,--
  My daughter,--with this name my song shall end,--
  I see thee not and hear thee not, but none
  Can be so wrapped in thee; thou art the friend
  To whom the shadows of far years extend.

         *       *       *       *       *

  'To aid thy mind's developments, to watch
  The dawn of little joys, to sit and see
  Almost thy very growth, to view thee catch
  Knowledge of objects,--wonders yet to thee,--
  And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,--
  This it should seem was not reserved for me.
  Yet this was in my nature,--as it is,
  I know not what there is, yet something like to this.

         *       *       *       *       *

  'Yet though dull hate as duty should be taught,
  I know that thou wilt love me; though my name
  Should be shut out from thee as spell still fraught
  With desolation and a broken claim,
  Though the grave close between us,--'t were the same,
  I know that thou wilt love me, though to drain
  My blood from out thy being were an aim
  And an attainment,--all will be in vain.'

To all these charges against her, sent all over the world in verses
as eloquent as the English language is capable of, the wife replied
nothing.

  'Assailed by slander and the tongue of strife,
  Her only answer was,--a blameless life.'

She had a few friends, a very few, with whom she sought solace and
sympathy. One letter from her, written at this time, preserved by
accident, is the only authentic record of how the matter stood with her.

We regret to say that the publication of this document was not brought
forth to clear Lady Byron's name from her husband's slanders, but to
shield him from the worst accusation against him, by showing that this
crime was not included in the few private confidential revelations that
friendship wrung from the young wife at this period.

Lady Anne Barnard, authoress of 'Auld Robin Grey', a friend whose
age and experience made her a proper confidante, sent for the
broken-hearted, perplexed wife, and offered her a woman's sympathy.

To her Lady Byron wrote many letters, under seal of confidence, and
Lady Anne says: 'I will give you a few paragraphs transcribed from
one of Lady Byron's own letters to me. It is sorrowful to think that
in a very little time this young and amiable creature, wise, patient,
and feeling, will have her character mistaken by every one who reads
Byron's works. To rescue her from this I preserved her letters, and
when she afterwards expressed a fear that anything of her writing
should ever fall into hands to injure him (I suppose she meant by
publication), I safely assured her that it never should. But here this
letter shall be placed, a sacred record in her favour, unknown to
herself.

 'I am a very incompetent judge of the impression which the last Canto
 of "Childe Harold" may produce on the minds of indifferent readers.

 'It contains the usual trace of a conscience restlessly awake, though
 his object has been too long to aggravate its burden, as if it could
 thus be oppressed into eternal stupor. I will hope, as you do, that it
 survives for his ultimate good.

 'It was the acuteness of his remorse, impenitent in its character,
 which so long seemed to demand from my compassion to spare every
 semblance of reproach, every look of grief, which might have said to
 his conscience, "You have made me wretched."

 'I am decidedly of opinion that he is responsible. He has wished to
 be thought partially deranged, or on the brink of it, to perplex
 observers and prevent them from tracing effects to their real causes
 through all the intricacies of his conduct. I was, as I told you, at
 one time the dupe of his acted insanity, and clung to the former
 delusions in regard to the motives that concerned me personally, till
 the whole system was laid bare.

 'He is the absolute monarch of words, and uses them, as Bonaparte did
 lives, for conquest, without more regard to their intrinsic value,
 considering them only as ciphers, which must derive all their import
 from the situation in which he places them, and the ends to which he
 adapts them, with such consummate skill.

 'Why, then, you will say, does he not employ them to give a better
 colour to his own character? Because he is too good an actor to
 over-act, or to assume a moral garb, which it would be easy to strip
 off.
