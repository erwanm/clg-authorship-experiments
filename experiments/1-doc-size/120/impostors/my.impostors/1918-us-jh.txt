two of boiling hot tea, and let himself be covered up with blan- 
kets, so that he might not die of pneumonia before he could 
get to court. 

Next morning there was a crowded court-room and a stern 
and solemn judge frowning over his spectacles, and Lawyer 
Norwood making an impassioned defence of the fundamental 
American right of free speech. It was so very thrilling that 
Jimmie could hardly be kept from applauding his own lawyer I 





And then Comrade Dr. Service arose, and in his most impres- 
sive voice gave the professional information that "Wild Bill's" 
nose had been broken, and three of his front teeth knocked out, 
and that he was in the hospital and unable to come to court; 
and all the other prisoners were called upon to testify what 
"Wild Bill" had done to bring this fate upon him. The police- 
man who had struck the blow testified that the prisoner had 
resisted arrest ; a second policeman testified, "I seen the prisoner 
hit him first, your Honour," which caused Comrade Mabel 
Smith to cry out, "Oh, the ungrammatical prevaricator!" 

The upshot of the trial was that each of the defendants 
was fined ten dollars. Comrade Gerrity led off with an indig- 
nant refusal to pay the fine; the rest of them followed suit 
even Comrade Mabel ! This caused evident distress of mind to 
the judge, for Comrade Mabel with her indignant pink cheeks 
and her big picture-hat looked more than ever the lady, and it 
is a fact known even to judges that American jails have not 
been constructed for ladies. The matter was settled by Lawyer 
Norwood paying her fine, in spite of her protests, and her 
demand to be sent to jail.

The five men were led away, over the "Bridge of Sighs," as 
it was called, to the city jail, where they had their pedigrees 
taken again, and their pictures and their finger-prints which 
for the first time impressed upon their minds the fact that they 
were dangerous criminals. Their clothes were taken away, and 
shirts and trousers given them, whose faded blue colour seemed 
to have been impregnated with the misery of scores of previous 
wearers. They were led through steel-barred doors, and along 
dark, steel-barred passages to one of the "tanks." A "tank," 
you discovered, was one floor of this four-storied packing box; 
on each side of it were a row of a dozen barred cells, each with 
four bunks, so that the total maximum population which might 
be crowded into the central space of the "tank" was ninety-six ; 
however, this only happened on Monday mornings, when the 
"drunks" had all been brought in, and before the courts had had 
time to sort them out. 

After you had lain down on your bunk for a few minutes, or 
had leaned against the wall of the "tank," you felt an annoy- 



 

ing stinging sensation somewhere on you. You began to rub 
and scratch; before long you would be rubbing and scratching 
in a dozen different places, and then you would observe your 
neighbour watching you with a grin. "Seam-squirrels?" he 
would say ; and he would bid you take off your coat, and engage 
in the popular hunting game of the institution. Jimmie re- 
membered having heard a speaker refer to the city jail as the 
"Leesville Louse-ranch" ; he had thought that a good joke at the 
time, but now it seemed otherwise to him. 

It was splendid to stand up in court and to take your stand 
as a martyr ; but now Jimmie discovered, as many an unfortunate 
has discovered before him, that being a martyr is not the sport 
it is cracked up to be. There were no heroics now, no singing. 
If you even so much as hummed, they took you out and shut 
you up in a dark hole called the "cooler" ! Nor could you read, 
for there was no light in your cell, and perpetual twilight in the 
central gathering place of the "tank." Apparently the only 
things the authorities of Leesville wished you to do were to 
hunt "seam-squirrels," to smoke cigarettes, to "shoot craps," and 
to make the acquaintance of a variety of interesting young 
criminals, so that when you were ready to resume your outside 
life you might decide whether you wanted to be a hold-up man, 
a safe-cracker, a forger, or a second-story operator. 

Jimmie Higgins, of course, brought a different psychology 
from that of the average jail-inmate. Jimmie could do his 
kind of work just as well in jail as anywhere else ; and barring 
the torment of vermin, the diet of bread and thin coffee and ill- 
smelling greasy soup, and the worry about his helpless family 
outside, he really had a happy time making the acquaintance 
of hoboes and pickpockets, and explaining to them the revolu- 
tionary philosophy. A man who went in to remedy social in- 
justice all by himself could never get very far. It was only when 
he realised himself as a member of a class, and stood as a class 
and acted as a class, that he could accomplish a permanent result. 
Some of the workers had discovered this, and had set out to edu- 
cate their fellows. They brought the wondrous message, even ta 
those in jail; holding out to them the vision of a world made 
over in justice and kindness, the co-operative commonwealth 
of labour, in which every man should get what he produced, and 
no man could exploit his fellows.

Three days passed, and then one afternoon Jimmie was 
summoned to see a visitor. He could guess who the visitor was, 
and he went with his heart in his throat, and looked through the 
dark mesh of wire, and saw Lizzie standing stout, motherly 
Lizzie, now very pale, and breathing hard, and with tears running 
in little streamlets down her cheeks. Poor Lizzie, with her 
three babies at home, and her plain, ordinary, non-revolutionary
