just as Eve was ; only you have not seen the serpent," 

"What have we been deceived in, sir ? " said the boys and 
Friscilla together. 

" What has the Lord ever told you to do, which you have 
put off doing, because something said to you that by and by 
would be just as well ? " 

" Uncle," said Dan, frankly, " I thought it was my own 
wicked heart that said that. I did not think it was the 
devil" 

"Dan, my boy," said my uncle, "your own heart gives 
consent to it, no doubt; but 'that old serpent which 
deceiveth the whole world,' never loses his opportunity, nor 
leaves unattended to a single one of his subjects. He is 
busy with us alL" 

I saw Dan's face flush, and I was about to speak, but 
Eliphalet prevented me. 

" Uncle Sam, I think Eve ought to have suspected mis- 
chief when the serpent began to talk to her." 



 

"Why' 

" It was unnatural, sir ; animals do not speak." 

" How did Eve know that ? " 

" Why, she had seen a good many animals, I should think; 
and she had never heard one of them talk." 

" Eve could not know that she had seen the whole. And 
she was in a garden of wonders; she was learning and 
finding out something new every day; how should she 
know but that this serpent was a new and extraordinary 
kind?" 

"Adam knew, uncle Sam, for he had named all the 
creatures." 

"That is a good remark, Dan ; but please to remember, he 
might not have had time to tell his wife all he knew. Eve 
was like a beautiful grown-up child, in the knowledge of 
many things." 

" But God had told them what would happen, uncle Sam, 
if they ate of the tree." 

"Ay, Prissy; and the serpent said another story ; he was 
a liar from the beginning; and Eve's faith and obedience 
gave way to his cunning temptation, and her own curiosity." 

" But Adam knew better." 

" Very likely that was why the serpent went to the woman. 
Adam was not deceived, the Bible says." 

" Uncle Sam," said Eliphalet, " how do you know that it 
was the devil that tempted Eve, and not just a serpent ? " 

" Because the Bible calls him ' that old serpent, which is 
the devil, and Satan.' " 

"But, uncle Sam," said I, earnestly, "you spoke just now 
as if Dan was one of his subjects." 

"Well, isn't he?" said my uncle. "There are only two 
kingdoms, dear little Tiny, and two Princes. One is the 
Lord Jesus ; and the other is the  Prince of the power of the 
air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.' Eeverybody is under the one or the other; and till 
we are in the kingdom of Jesus, we are under the rule and 
dominion of the devil" 

" Under his domnion, uncle !" 



 

" He is called the Prince of this world, Tiny. And if you 
read the Bible carefully, you will see that he sets a-going 
every bad thing that is done. It was he tempted David to 
indidge his pride in numbering Israel It was he put it 
into the heart of Judas to betray his Master. He would 
have sifted Peter like wheat, if Peter's Saviour had not been 
too strong for hinu He was at the root of the lie that 
Ananias told. It is he that comes and catches away the good 
seed, when it is sown in careless hearts ; and he ' blinds the 
eyes of them which believe not.' He is the ' ruler of the darkness of this world,' â€” what a dreadful kingdom to be in ! 
In the field of this world, sown with wheat and tares,  the 
tares are the children of the wicked one.' ' Taken captive 
by him at his will,' they are said to be ; to turn them to God, 
is to take them ' from the power of Satan.' " 

"Then if they are under his power, uncle Sam," said 
liph, "how are they to blame for what they do I " 

" Because they need not be under his power one moment. 
David risked his life to save a sheep of his flock ; and our 
Lord Jesus is a better Shepherd than he. The feeblest little 
lamb never cried to Him out of the very mouth of the lion, 
that he did not hear and deliver it." 

"Did Satan get all this power," Dan asked, "because 
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit ? " 

" Then they lost their protection, Dan. They were rebels ; 
they had forfeited all the privileges of the government they 
were under.. Yes, Satan got his power then." 

"And then one sin followed another," said Dan. 

" Fast. They had been as innocent as little children from
