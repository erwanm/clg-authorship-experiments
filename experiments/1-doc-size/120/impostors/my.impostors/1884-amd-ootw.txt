little company when she could not go. 

Then her eyes were opened rudely. Thomas Marshall 
was discharged for drunkenness and insolence. He came 
home to his wife at midnight in a terrible state, and 
Eleanor went almost crazy. When he recovered he 
upbraided himself fiercely, and called himself all the 
monsters in the world. If Nelly only would forgive 

him! 

She forgave him and loved him, and learned to think of 
him pityingly. She tried to be strong for both, to rouse 
and inspire him; but he was a slave to the fatal weakness. 
With a wife's faith and enthusiasm she blamed the mis- 
fortunes, the world, the friends who no longer stood 
ready to help, and with the utmost loyalty clung to him. 
She felt then that she must be the bread-winner until bet- 
ter times, and filled her house with boarders, for she was 
much too proud to complain to Aunt Clara. The defec- 
tion of friends was borne bravely, sacrifices were made 
without a murmur. She prayed, she counselled, she 
pleaded, and it seemed as if her faith might almost 
inspire the dead; but presently her soul took in the sad, 



 

desolating truth, that her husband was not trying as a 
man should try in so great a strait. She importuned no 
more for promises, though she endeavored in every other 
way to rouse him. Was there some fatal weakness in 
the man? 

By slow degrees she found her position much changed. 
Old friends went in other directions, or, when they met, 
gave her a kind of patronizing sympathy that cut to the 
quick. The style of her boarders became different. The 
refined and courteous gentlemen gave way to a lower 
grade, not absolutely uncultured, but of the jolly, indif- 
ferent type. Tom took the head of the table, sometimes 
in a captious state, where he was loud and insolent, some- 
times, which was much worse to bear, foolishly maudlin 
with an unmeaning smile upon his flushed face. O 
Heaven ! could she parade the shame to strange eyes ? 

Two cruel wounds came to her presently. A Mr. 
Westlake, a plain, kindly man, was going West on some 
business and might possibly remain. Tom confessed to 
his wife that he had two or three times borrowed a little 
change from him and he would like Eleanor to pay it. 

"You borrowed money from him?" she asked in her 
clear, incisive tone, while a scarlet spot burned on her 
cheek. " How much ? " 

"I don't remember. You needn't be so confounded 
sharp about it ! He'sa good fellow, and he said it didn't 
make any difference." 

"Next time come to me for money." Her heart 
swelled in secret shame, and she sought out Mr. West- 
lake, stumbling through a most mortifying explanation. 

" It doesn't matter, Mrs. Marshall. I never meant to 
mention it when I found — when he — please let it go." 

" No, Mr. Westlake, if you are the true friend I take 
you to be, you cannot refuse me the honesty of paying 
this debt, which is as sacred to me as if I had borrowed 
it." 





Westlake searched his memorandum. He hated dread- 
fully to take the money from her. Most of it had been 
borrowed months ago, before he understood Mr. Mar- 
shall's devious ways. 

" I wish you 'd let it go ! " in a voice of entreaty. 

" I cannot," she answered firmly. 

"Well — altogether it is twenty-three dollars." He 
did not dare falsify with her clear eyes upon him, but for 
all that she wrung the truth out of him reluctantly". 

Mrs. Marshall paid the bill, and Mr. Westlake bade 
her a kindly good-by, his soul deeply moved to pity. 

Was there anyone else? she wondered. 

She asked her husband that evening. He shambled 
and hesitated, and, when she insisted, confessed that he 
owed Collamore somewhere about ten dollars, and Den- 
forth a trifle, — four or five dollars. 

" O Tom!" she exclaimed with a great dry sob, 
" how could you ? How could you ? " 

Tom buried his face in his hands and wept aloud, being 
in a melting mood. 

"O Nelly, you are an angel and I am a brute! I 
ought to go pff and drown myself, instead of hanging on 
you, I mean to get something to do, and we will be 
happy once again, my poor darling." 

Eleanor had learned by bitter experience that these 
were withes of straw, not moods of soberness or fruits of 
repentance. She had pleaded and believed until she had 
lost the last remnant of faith. Only a miracle could 
bring that back. 

The next episode had in it all the elements of a horrible 
alarm, an insult so keen that it seemed at first as if she 
could never look the world in the face again. A Mr.
