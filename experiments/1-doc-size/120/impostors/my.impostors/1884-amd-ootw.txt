thing to do ; 'nl would, only that blasted Caruth woman 
came along. I 'd like to break her neck, 'n I will some 
day. She'd no business to interfere between man and 
wife ; 'n a wife 's no business to go away from her home, 
'n break up a man's life ; that 's what I say." And Tom 
Marshall brought down his fist upon the bureau with such 
force that Mrs. Marshall sprang from her chair. 

" O Tom," she entreated, " don't be so hard, so rude. 
You are so changed, I can hardly believe it is you." 

" 'S 'nough to change a man, to take away all his chil- 
dren ; " and he began to whimper. 

" But, Tom, when you did have them," — rather incoher- 
ently, in her thin, soft, cultured voice, — " I am afraid you 
were not always — " 

" Who has been complaining, — El'nor ? I was always 
good to her, until she took to being so high and mighty, 'n 
holding me off at arm's length, 'n settin' the children up 
against me. Bertie loved me. He wasn't afraid to come 
to his poor father. I 've had such dev'lish luck all these 
years, 'n everything 's gone against me ; but it 's been 
seven years, 'n then luck changes. I'll get something to 
do and make a fortune yet, 'nother one, an' ride in my car- 
riage before I die ; but you may bet your life El'nor won't 
be in it ! I 'll have my boy, and she can have the girls. 
Girta no great shakes anyhow, just like their mother. Any- 



 

body who leaves me 'n tight times, and can't stick to a fel- 
low when he 's goin' down hill, 'll never have the spending 
of my money. Luck 'll turn, — it 'most always does. 
She'd be glad enough to come back." 

"O Tom, if you would get something to do, and be 
yourself once more," implored his mother. 

He gazed vacantly at her. 

"Mighty hard up just now," he muttered. "El'nor 
went off 'n took everything but a bed ; robbed me of 
everything, 'n left me to go where f could, and she living 
in style and flaunting about! Where 'd she get that 
money, I want to know — she and that dev'lish Caruth 
woman conniving together." 

" O Tom ! " almost shrieked the poor old lady. "Don't 
be so dreadfully coarse and profane ! " How could Elea- 
nor have allowed him to fall into such habits? That she 
had suffered from them, that she had seen her innocent 
children shocked, and feared for Bertie's habits, never once 
occurred to the elder lady. The poor woman was not 
strong enough to cope with him, and great shivers of dis- 
gust crept over her. Leaning back in her chair, she sighed 
and wished Eleanor could have seen her duty to her hus- 
band. Or if Katharine were only here. 

" Old lady, you 're looking used up," Tom said, watch- 
ing her. " If you 'll give me a trifle, 'nough to find me a 
night's lodging, I 'll get out of this luxury 'n elegance. 
'It isn't quite my style nowadays." 

She was helpless to argue, to advise, to call him to a 
sense of his present degradation. She tottered across the 
room, and took a pocket-book out of the bureau drawer. 
It contained fifteen dollars. " This will last you a little 
while," she said tremulously, handing it to him with cold, 
white fingers. 

"Much obliged, I'm sure," and Tom made a kind of 
shame-f aced snatch at it, averting his eyes. " Wouldn't 





have come, if I hadn't been awfully hard up;" and h« 
shambled to the door, nodding a careless good-by. 

When he was gone she covered her face with her hands, 
and bitter tears of pain and shame forced their way 
through her fingers. Her son ! No, it cannot be. Has 
not some one been playing a trick upon her? Ah, if 
it might only be! Her heart grows bitterer against 
Eleanor; it seems as if she must have had a hand in 
this complete ruin. Wives always have so much influence 
over their husbands. Did she? She does not consider 
that point. Did Katharine ? But then it was Eleanor's 
duty. 

Another week's illness succeeded this interview. She 
confessed to Katharine that Tom had been in and she had 
given him some money, but she could not tell the worst. 

"Do you think he had been drinking?" asked Mrs. 
Vanduyne sharply. 

"I — I am so little used to seeing people in that state," 
temporized the poor lady. "He has changed terribly. 
It was the ruin of his life for Eleanor to desert him." 

"She had no business to cast her burden off upon 
others," declared Mrs. Vanduyne sharply. "If every 
wife and every husband did it when matters went wrong, 
there would be a fine state of society. Does she expect 
us to look after him?" 

Lying in her luxurious room, pillowed on a soft couch, 
poor Mrs. Marshall felt that the world had gone sadly 
wrong, that the wives of the present day cast off their re- 
sponsibility too easily. Mrs. Vanduyne was very angry 
at the complication ; for she was suffering on every side, 
while the Wilders seemed scarcely touched, for the Cav- 
endish Moreton visit had swallowed up smaller matters. 
To be left out of all those gatherings was a positive
