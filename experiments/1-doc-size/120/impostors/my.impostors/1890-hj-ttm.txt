a consommation of three sous, to save fire and candles at home. 
We have lived in places we couldn't sit in, if you want to 
know where there was only really room if we were in bed. 
Mamma's money is sent out from England, and sometimes it 
didn't come. Once it didn't come for months for months 
and months. I don't know how we lived. There wasn't any 
to come ; there wasn't any to get home. That isn't amusing 
when you're away, in a foreign town, without any friends. 
Mamma used to borrow, but people wouldn't always lend. You 
needn't be afraid she won't borrow from you. We are rather 
better now. Something has been done in England ; I don't 
understand what. It's only fivepence a year, but it has been 
settled ; it comes regularly ; it used to come only when we had 
written and begged and waited. But it made no difference ; 
mamma was always up to her ears in books. They served her 
for food and drink. When she had nothing to eat she began 
a novel in ten volumes the old-fashioned ones ; they lasted 
longest. She knows every cabinet de lecture in every town ; 
the little cheap, shabby ones, I mean, in the back streets, 
where they have odd volumes and only ask a sou, and the 
books are so old that they smell bad. She takes them to the 
cafs the little cheap, shabby cafes, too and she reads there 
all the evening. That's very well for her, but it doesn't feed 
me. I don't like a diet of dirty old novels. I sit there beside 
her, with nothing to do, not even a stocking to mend ; she 
doesn't think that's comme il faut. I don't know what the 
people take me for. However, we have never been spoken to : 





any one can see mamma's a lady. As for me, I dare say I 
might be anything. If you're going to be an actress you must 
get used to being looked at. There were people in England, 
who vised to ask us to stay ; some of them were our cousins 
or mamma says they were. I have never been very clear 
about our cousins, and I don't think they were at all clear 
about us. Some of them are dead ; the others don't ask us 
any more. You should hear mamma on. the subject of our 
visits in England. It's very convenient when your cousins 
are dead, because that explains everything. Mamma has 
delightful phrases : ' My family is almost extinct.' Then your 
family may have been anything you like. Ours, of course, 
was magnificent. We did stay in a place once where there 
was a deer-park, and also private theatricals. I played in 
them ; I was only fifteen years old, but I was very big and I 
thought I was in heaven. I will go anywhere you like ; you 
needn't be afraid ; we have been in places ! I have learned a 
great deal that way ; sitting beside mamma and watching 
people, their faces, their types, their movements. There's a 
great deal goes on in cafes : people come to them to talk 
things over, their private affairs, their complications ; they 
have important meetings. Oh, I've observed scenes, between 
men and women very quiet, terribly quiet, but tragic ! Once 
I saw a woman do something that I'm going to do some day, 
when I'm great if I can get the situation. I'll tell you what 
it is some day ; I'll do it for you. Oh, it is the book of life ! " 

So Miriam discoursed, familiarly, disconnectedly, as the pair 
went their way down the Rue de Constantinople ; and she 
continued to abound in anecdote and remark after they were 
seated face to face at a little marble table in an establishment 
which Sherringham selected carefully and he had caused her, at 
her request, to be accommodated with sirop <T orgeat. " I know 
what it will come to : Madame Carre will want to keep me." 
This was one of the announcements she presently made. 

"To keep you]" 

"For the French stage. She won't want to let you have 
me." She said things of that kind, astounding in self- 
complacency, the assumption of quick success. She was in 
earnest, evidently prepared to work, but her imagination flew 
over preliminaries and probations, took no account of the steps 
in the process, especially the first tiresome ones, the test of 
patience. Sherringham had done nothing for her as yet, given 
substantial pledge of interest ; yet she was already talk- 
ing as if his protection were assured and jealous. Certainly, 





however, she seemed to belong to him very much indeed, as she 
sat facing him in the Paris cafe, in her youth, her beauty and 
her talkative confidence. This degree of possession was highly 
agreeable to him, and he asked nothing more than to make it 
last and go further. The impulse to draw her out was irre- 
sistible, to encourage her to show herself to the end ; for if he 
was really destined to take her career in hand he counted 
on some pleasant equivalent such, for instance, as that she 
should at least amuse him. 

"It's very singular; I know nothing like it," he said 
"your equal mastery of two languages." 

" Say of half a dozen," Miriam smiled. 

" Oh, I don't believe in the others to the same degree. I 
don't imagine that, with all deference to your undeniable 
facility, you would be judged fit to address a German or an 
Italian audience in their own tongue. But you might a 
French, perfectly, and they are the most particular of all ; for 
their idiom is supersensitive and they are incapable of endur- 
ing the baragouinage of foreigners, to which vre listen with 
such complacency. In fact, your French is better than your 
English it's more conventional ; there are little queernesses 
and impurities in your English, as if you had lived abroad too 
much. Ah, you must work that." 

" I'll work it with you. I like the way you speak." 

" You must speak beautifully ; you must do something for 
the standard." 

"For the standard?" 

" There isn't any, after all ; it has gone to the dogs.''
