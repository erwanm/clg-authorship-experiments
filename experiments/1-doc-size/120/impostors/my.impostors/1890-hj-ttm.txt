possible to grant it sometimes, if you wish to withhold it ever." 

" And what do you mean by dreariness ? That's modern 
slang, and it's terribly vague. Many good things are dreary 
virtue and decency and charity and perseverance and 
courage and honour." 

" Say at once that life is dreary, my dear fellow ! " Gabriel 
Nash exclaimed. 

" That's on the whole my most usual impression." 

" C'est Id que je vous attends ! I'm precisely engaged in 
trying what can be done in taking it the other way. It's my 
little personal experiment. Life consists of the personal 
experiments of each of us, and the point of an experiment is 
that it shall succeed. What we contribute is our treatment 
of the material, our rendering of the text, our style. A sense 
of the qualities of a style is so rare that many persons should 
doubtless be forgiven for not being able to read, or at all 
events to enjoy us ; but is that a reason for giving it up for 
not being, in this other sphere, if one possibly can, a Macaulay, 
a Ruskin, a Kenan ? Ah, we must write our best ; it's the 
great thing we can do in the world, on the right side. One 
has one's form, que diable, and a mighty good thing that one 
has. I'm not afraid of putting alL life into mine, without 
unduly squeezing it. I'm not afraid of putting in honour and 
courage and charity, without spoiling them : on the contrary, 
I'll only do them good. People may not read you at sight, 
may not like you, but there's a chance they'll come round ; 
and the only way to court the chance is to keep it up 
always to keep it up. That's what I do, my dear fellow, if 
you don't think I've perseverance. If some one likes it here 
and there, if you give a little impression of solidity, that's 
your reward ; besides, of course, the pleasure for yourself." 

" Don't you think your style is a little affected ? " Nick 
asked, laughing, as they proceeded. 

" That's always the charge against a personal manner ; if 
"you have any at all people think you have too much. 
Perhaps, perhaps who can say] Of course one isn't perfect ; 
but that's the delightful thing about art, that there is always 
more to learn and more to do ; one can polish and polish and 
refine and refine. No doubt I'm rough still, but I'm in the 
right direction : I make it my business to take for granted an 
interest in the beautiful," 





"Ah, the beautiful there it stands, over there!" said 
Nick Dormer. " I am not so sure about yours I don't know 
what I've got hold of. But Notre Dame is solid ; Notre Dame 
is wise ; on Notre Dame the distracted mind can rest. Come 
over and look at her ! " 

They had come abreast of the low island from which the 
great cathedral, disengaged to-day from her old contacts and 
adhesions, rises high and fair, with her front of beauty and 
her majestic mass, darkened at that hour, or at least simplified, 
under the stars, but only more serene and sublime for her 
happy union, far aloft, with the cool distance and the night. 
Our young men, gossiping as profitably as I leave the reader 
to estimate, crossed the wide, short bridge which made them 
face toward the monuments of old Paris the Palais do 
Justice, the Conciergerie, the holy chapel of Saint Louis. 
They came out before the church, which looks down on a 
square where the past, once so thick in the very heart of 
Paris, has been made rather a blank, pervaded, however, by 
the everlasting freshness of the great cathedral-face. It 
greeted Nick Dormer and Gabriel Nash with a kindness 
which the centuries had done nothing to dim. The lamplight 
of the great city washed its foundations, but the towers and 
buttresses, the arches, the galleries, the statues, the vast rose- 
window, the large, full composition, seemed to grow clearer as 
they climbed higher, as if they had a conscious benevolent 
answer for the upward gaze of men. 

" How it straightens things out and blows away one's 
vapours anything that's done ! " said Nick ; while his com- 
panion exclaimed, blandly and affectionately : 

"The dear old thing!" 

" The great point is to do something, instead of standing 
muddling and questioning ; and, by Jove, it makes me 
want to ! " 

" Want to build a cathedral ] " Nash inquired. 

" Yes, just that." 

" It's you who puzzle me, then, my dear fellow. You can't 
build them out of words." 

"What is ib the great poets do? " asked Nick. 

" Their words are ideas their words are images, enchanting 
collocations and ' unforgettable signs. But the verbiage of 
parliamentary speeches ! " 

" Well," said Nick, with a candid, reflective sigh, "you can 
rear a great structure of many things not only of stones arid 
timbers and painted glass." They v:alked round Notre Dame, 





pausing, criticizing, admiring and discussing ; mingling the 
grave with the gay and paradox with contemplation. Behind 
and at the sides the huge dusky vessel of the church seemed 
to dip into the Seine, or rise out of it, floating expansively a 
ship of stone, with its flying buttresses thrown forth like an 
array of mighty oars. Nick Dormer lingered near it with 
joy, with a certain soothing content ; as if it had been the 
temple of a faith so dear to him that there was peace and 
security in its precinct. And there was comfort too, and
