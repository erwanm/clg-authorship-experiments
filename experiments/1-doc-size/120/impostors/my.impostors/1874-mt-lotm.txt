eloquent tongue would turn itself loose. As long as I 
would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he 
knew all breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them 
all with his affectionate tongue. I tramped along in 
voiceless misery while the cattle question was up. 
When I could endure it no longer, I used to deftly 
insert a scientific topic into the conversation ; then my 
eye fired and his faded ; my tongue fluttered, his 
stopped; life was a joy to me, and a sadness to him. 

One day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat 
of diffidence : 



“Triangle, would you mind coming down to my 
state-room a minute and have a little talk on a certain 
matter?” 

I went with him at once. Arrived there, he put his 
head out, glanced up and down the saloon warily, then 
closed the door and locked it. We sat down on the 
sofa and he said : 

“I’m a-going to make a little proposition to you, 
and if it strikes you favorable, it’ll be a middling good 
thing for both of us. You ain’t a-going out to Cali- 
forny for fun, nuther am I — it’s business , ain’t that 
so? Well, you can do me a good turn, and so can I 
you, if we see fit. I’ve raked and scraped and saved a 
considerable many years, and I’ve got it all here.” 
He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos of 
shabby clothes aside, and drew a short, stout bag into 
view for a moment, then buried it again and relocked 
the trunk. Dropping his voice to a cautious, low tone, 
he continued: “She’s all there — a round ten thou- 
sand dollars in yellow-boys ; now, this is my little idea: 
What I don’t know about raising cattle ain’t worth 
knowing. There’s mints of money in it in Calif orny. 
Well, I know, and you know, that all along a line 
that’s being surveyed, there’s little dabs of land that 
they call ‘gores,’ that fall to the surveyor free gratis 
for nothing. All you’ve got to do on your side is to 
survey in such a way that the * gores ’ will fall on good 
fat land, then you turn ’em over to me, I stock ’em 
with cattle, in rolls the cash, I plank out your share of 
the dollars regular right along, and ’ ’ 

I was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm, but it 
could not be helped. I interrupted and said severely: 

“I am not that kind of a surveyor. Let us change 
the subject, Mr. Backus.” 

It was pitiful to see his confusion and hear his awkward 
and shamefaced apologies. I was as much distressed as 
he was — especially as he seemed so far from having 
suspected that there was anything improper in his 
proposition. So I hastened to console him and lead 
him on to forget his mishap in a conversational orgy 
about cattle and butchery. We were lying at Acapulco,
and as we went on deck it happened luckily 
that the crew were just beginning to hoist some 
beeves aboard in slings. Backus’ melancholy vanished 
instantly, and with it the memory of his late mistake. 

“Now, only look at that!” cried he. “My good- 
ness, Triangle, what would they say to it in Ohio ? 
Wouldn’t their eyes bug out to see ’em handled like 
that? — wouldn’t they, though?” 

All the passengers were on deck to look, — even the 
gamblers, — and Backus knew them all, and had 
afflicted them all with his pet topic. As I moved 
away I saw one of the gamblers approach and accost 
him; then another of them; then the third. I halted, 
waited, watched; the conversation continued between 
the four men ; it grew earnest ; Backus drew gradually 
away ; the gamblers followed and kept at his elbow. I 
was uncomfortable. However, as they passed me 
presently, I heard Backus say with a tone of perse- 
cuted annoyance : 

“But it ain’t any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, 
as I’ve told you a half a dozen times before, I warn’t 
raised to it, and I ain’t a-going to resk it.” 

I felt relieved. “ His level head will be his sufficient 
protection,” I said to myself. 

During the fortnight’s run from Acapulco to San 
Francisco I several times saw the gamblers talking 
earnestly with Backus, and once I threw out a gentle 
warning to him. He chuckled comfortably and said : 

“ Oh, yes ! they tag around after me considerable — 
want me to play a little, just for amusement, they 
say — but laws-a-me, if my folks have told me once to 
look out for that sort of live-stock, they’ve told me a 
thousand times, I reckon.” 

By and by, in due course, we were approaching San 
Francisco. It was an ugly, black night, with a strong 
wind blowing, but there was not much sea. I was on 
deck alone. Toward ten I started below. A figure 
issued from the gamblers’ den and disappeared in the 
darkness. I experienced a shock, for I was sure it was 
Backus. I flew down the companion-way, looked 
about for him, could not find him, then returned to 
the deck just in time to catch a glimpse of him as he 
re-entered that confounded nest of rascality. Had he 
yielded at last? I feared it. What had he gone below 
for? His bag of coin? Possibly. I drew near the 
door, full of bodings. It was a-crack, and I glanced 
in and saw a sight that made me bitterly wish I had 
given my attention to saving my poor cattle-friend, 
instead of reading and dreaming my foolish time away. 
He was gambling. Worse still, he was being plied 
with champagne, and was already showing some effect 
from it. He praised the “ cider,” as he called it, and
