in those times of bloody persecution the Christian 
church gave her testimony and fought and suffered ; 



 

what a power of Faith, Hope and Love made itself 
known, that could shout for joy at the stake; and 
when I think how cold, how lukewarm, how love 
less Christianity is now I could almost wish for a 
mighty persecution to come, to break up the rotten 
peace of Christians who have grown easy and luxurious and to arouse again the right heroism of the 
soldiers of God. 

"'It is not only in the times of the Jews and 
the Romans, at the first founding of the Christian 
church, that such mighty battles of heroes have 
been fought ; the dear and blessed time of the Reformation has had its martyrs, who for the pure 
word and true sacrament of our beloved Lutheran 
church staked their persons and lives. Who does 
not know those two faithful disciples, who amid 
songs of praise were burned at the stake at Cologne on the Rhine? that Heinrich von Zutphen, 
who had to give up his life in Ditmarsh? those 
thousands who were murdered or burned by the 
Catholic Inquisition ? those thousands who had to 
pine away in the prisons and cloisters of the Catholics? without reckoning the hundreds of thousands 
in the religious wars stirred up by the Catholics who 
made the battle-fields fat with their blood and have 
died for the faith of their church ? And now I will 
tell you why I have brought you here to-day to 
this Tiefenthal. We stand upon holy ground here ; 
upon ground of the martyrs. Hear what your fathers suffered for the sake of the pure, true word 
and sacrament. 



 

" The story that I am going to tell to you must 
have been acted out somewhere between 1521 and 
1530. For in the chronicle where I have read the 
story, mention is made of the Diet at Speier; but 
nothing is said of the Diet at Augsburg.' " 

" Stop, Ditto, please," said Maggie. " What's a 
diet ? " 

"The supreme council of the German empire, 
composed of princes and representatives of inde 
pendent cities of the empire. The famous Diet of 
Augsburg was held in 1530." 

" What was it famous for ? " 

" Famous for an open, bold confession and declaration of the Protestant faith, by a few Protestant 
princes, in the midst of the crowd of Catholics as 
sembled at the Diet. Well, Meredith" 

'"Nothing is said of the Diet at Augsburg. And 
certainly some mention would have been made of 
it, if it had already taken place, since our beloved 
princes, the dukes Ernst and Francis of Luneburg, 
had their share in the precious confession of faith. 
At that time there was in Hermannsburg a young 
Catholic pastor, descended from a noble patrician 
family ; he was called Christopher Grunhagen, and 
was a kind-hearted man. One day ' " 

" Stop a minute, Ditto. Some people were Catholics then, and some were Protestants ? " 

" Why that is how they are now, Maggie," said 
her sister. 

" But I mean, there in Germany." 

"It is so still in Germany," said Meredith. "But 



 

then was just the beginning of the Reformation, 
Muggie. Luther was preaching, and the world was 
in a stir generally." 

" ' One day there comes to Pastor Grunhagen a 
sort of artisan fellow, who asked for a bit of bread. 
It was in winter time, and the poor man was quite 
benumbed with cold. Pastor Grunhagen took pity 
on him, had him served with food and drink, and 
made him sit down in the Flett (that is, the open 
hall of the house with its low fireplace) that he 
might also warm his cold limbs. After the man had 
eaten, not forgetting to pray either, he stretched 
his legs comfortably down by the warm hearth, 
and then drew a small MS. book out of his pocket, 
in which he began to read with eager and devout at 
tention. Grunhagen wondered that the man could 
read, and more especially, that he could read writing. Now, indeed, an artisan would take it ill if 
anybody were surprised to find him able to read. 
But the fact that all of us, even the poorest and the 
smallest, can read now, is just one of the blessings 
of the Reformation, under which the first schools 
for the people were established. In those days only 
scholars and priests could read, and the laity, even 
the nobles, knew nothing about it. So Grunhagen 
steps up curiously to the remarkable artisan who 
knows so much as to read, and asks him, " Pray 
what have you there ? " For all answer, the man 
hands him the book. Grunhagen takes it and reads 
and reads, and the more he reads the more eagerly 
and attentively he devours what he finds there. It 



 

was a copy of Luther's smaller catechism. Like a 
lightning flash, darts through his soul the thought,
