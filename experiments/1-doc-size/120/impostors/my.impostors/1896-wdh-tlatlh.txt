grass. 

He lingered more and more as they drew near her 
father's house, in the abandon of a man's love. He 
wished to give himself solely up to it, to think and to 
talk of nothing else, after a man's fashion. But a 
woman's love is no such mere delight. It is serious, 
practical. For her it is all future, and she cannot give 
herself wholly up to any present moment of it, as a 
man does. 

" Now, JefE," she said, after a certain number of 
partings, in which she had apparently kept his duty, 
clearly in mind, "you had better go home and tell 
your mother." 

" Oh, there's time enough for that," he began. 

" I want you to tell her right away, or there won't 
be anything to tell." 

" Is that so ? " he joked back. " Well, if I must, I 
must, I suppose. But I didn't think you'd take the 
whip-hand so soon, Cynthia." 

" Oh, I don't ever want to take the whip-hand with 
you, Jeff. Don't make me ! " 




now, jeff, you had bf.tter go home and tell your 
mother' " 



 

" Well, I won't, then. But what are you in such a 
hurry to have mother know for ? She's not going to 
object. And if she does — " 

" It isn't that," said the girl. " If I had to go round 
a single day with your mother hiding this from her, 
I should begin to hate you. I couldn't bear the con- 
cealment. I shall tell father as soon as I go in." 

" Oh, your father 'll be all right, of course." 

"Yes, he'll be all right, but if he wouldn't, and I 
knew it, I should have to tell him, all the same. Now, 
good-night. Well, there, then; and there! Now, let 
me go ! " 

She paused for a moment in her own room, to 
smooth her tumbled hair, and try to identify herself 
in her glass. Then she went jnto the sitting-room, 
where she found her father pulled up to the table, with 
his hat on, and poring over a sheet of hieroglyphics, 
which represented the usual evening with planchette. 

" Have you been to help Jackson up ? " she asked. 

" Well, I wanted to, but he wouldn't hear of it. 
He's feelin' ever so much better to-night, and he 
wanted to go alone. I just come in." 

" Yes, you've got your hat on yet." 

Whitwell put his hand up and found that his daugh- 
ter was right. He laughed, and said, " I guess I must 
'a' forgot it. We've had the most interestin' season 
with plantchette that I guess we've about ever had. 
She's said something here — " 

" Well, never mind ; I've got something more impor- 
tant to say than plantchette has," said Cynthia, and she 
pulled the sheet away from under her father's eyes. 



 

This made him look up at her. " Why, what's hap- 
pened?" 

" Nothing. Jeff Durgin has asked me to marry 
him." 

" He has ! " The New England training is not such 
as to fit people for the expression of strong emotion, 
and the best that Whitwell found himself able to do 
in view of the fact was to pucker his mouth for a 
whistle which did not come. 

" Yes — this afternoon," said Cynthia, lifelessly. 
The tension of her nerves relaxed in a languor which 
was evident even to her father, though his eyes still 
wandered to the sheet she had taken from him. 

" Well, you don't seem over and above excited about 
it. Did — did you — What did you say ? " 

" How should I know what I said ? What do you 
think of it, father ? " 

" I don't know as I ever give the subject much at- 
tention," said the philosopher. " I always meant to 
take it out of him, somehow, if he got to playin' the 
fool." 

" Then you wanted I should accept him ? " 

" What difference 'd it make what I wanted ? That 
what you done ? " 

" Yes, I've accepted him," said the girl, with a sigh. 
" I guess I've always expected to." 

" Well, I thought likely it would come to that, my-
