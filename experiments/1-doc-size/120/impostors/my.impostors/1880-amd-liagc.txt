Well, no," and Roger gave an odd little laugh. " It is 
a queer sort of complication. She resembled a picture of 
a lost child that my aunt was interested in, and I set out 
to find her," continued Roger, blushing boyishly. "The 
man who had her died, and the woman married and went 
to Europe, taking the child, I heard. And there I lost 
sight of them. She isn't the same child, of course," rather 
disconsolately. 

"What do you want of her, then, if she hasn't the 
identical strawberry mark on her arm? and then this 





Ocleon is not considered very first class, and finally, whaft 
will you do with her ? " 

" Chaff away as much as you like, Ned, I was wonderfully 
taken with the little creature. Then the other story 
was so romantic. The child is daughter of a nobleman, 
and the nurse who was with her when she was lost lives 
with my aunt. There was no connecting link but this re- 
markable likeness, and as far as I could learn this Barrett! 
was her father, though the woman was not her mother. 
Theatrical people have queer antecedents. But I'd give 
anything to find this Titania. I am glad your aunt was so 
careful of your socks, Ned. What if I should make you a 
flying visit ? " 

" Upon my word you are quite a hero of romance. Sup- 
pose you tell the story coherently, so that I can distinguish 
between the lady of high degree, and the wonderful acro- 
bat, tight-rope dancer, &c." 

Roger succeeded in interesting Ned Strathan almost as 
keenly as he had been interested, and they planned for a 
visit. Roger went to his room, in a brown study, with the 
bit of paper in his hand. How odd that this should crop 
out again ! And yet it might be a different person. Ti- 
tania was not an unusual stage cognomen. But he would 
hunt her up without saying a word to Lai or his aunt. If 
he could learn whether Barretti was really her father! 
And yet a child of seven would remember if she had been 
lost in the street. But such romances seldom happened 
out of books, he told himself, by way of moderating his 
ardor. 

Still, he would so like to find Titania again, and the 
vision of the beautiful child floated before his eyes, in all 
her grace and witchery. What gave him this intense, ab- 
surd longing for her? 

They wondered at his aunt's why he should be so crazy 
as to set off on Monday for Ned Strathan's, when he had 



only parted with him on Friday, and, moreover, was not 
acquainted with another member of the family. 

" Why did you not ask him here ? " said Aunt Alice. 
"You boys might have had such a nice visit together." 

" I'll invite him next vacation," returned Roger, laugh- 
ingly. 

A two-hours' journey brought him to L . Ned met 

him at the station. 

" Now here's the Odeon," explained Ned, walking up 
the street. " You see it is no great affair. I called here 
on Saturday, and found the manager. His name is King. 
This child was the one Signer Barretti had ; but King said 
she was a puny little thing, not a bit handsome, and didn't 
do half the feats Thomas claimed that she could. She had 
a bad fall, and was taken to the hospital. King called 
Thomas a drunken swindler. Still I made an engagement," 
and Ned glanced furtively to see if his friend was dis- 
gusted. 

" You were good to learn that much, Ned," was the cor- 
dial response. " Can we see this King soon ? " 

"Yes. I said my friend would be here at two. He 
promised to meet us at the theatre, if you don't mind go- 
ing in such a hole ! It is patronized chiefly by the roughs. 
We have a very pretty opera-house in town," he an- 
nounced, with some pride. 

" At which we will hear nothing of Titania," appended 
Roger, with a smile. 

" Here is the private entrance. It is a horrid little hole," 
and the aristocratic Ned drew up his nose. "Through 
here to the green-room and private office." 

Rose and Lily De Vere were starring it in fresh pas- 
tures, and with new lovers. Still there was no lack of re- 
markable attractions on the show-bills. The two young 
men picked their way through the dirty, ill-smelling pas- 
sages, and reached the desired haven, perfumed with the 
odor of whiskey and tobacco. Mr. King had just stepped 





out, but would be in presently. They sat down amidst the 
disorder, and waited until patience came nearly to an end. 

He made his appearance at length, a short, stout, red- 
faced man, with a brisk, almost rough business-air. Seeing 
the two young men he nodded, and said, " Oh ! " with a 
kind of grunt. 

Ned Strathan explained, and introduced his friend. The
