out from under your arm as you sat sewing ! I 
was very fond of Frisky ; I have never had a pet 
since." 

" You loved him because you had tended him 
so carefully," said Aunt Faith. "It is the same 
feeling, intensified, that influences and inspires 
many of the weary fathers and mothers we see 
around us. Mr. Leslie was right. It is better 
to patiently fulfil our earthly duties, no matter 
how dull or how hard, as long as we are on the 
earth, than to sit apart nourishing lofty ideas 
and sighing: for release. That sentence which 
Mr. Leslie took for his text has always been a 
favorite of mine. Do you care to hear some 
verses I once made upon it ? " 

M Oh, yes, Aunt Faith ! " said Hugh and Bes- 
sie eagerly. 

Aunt Faith took a little blank-book from her 
desk and read as follows : — 



 

" St. John ; 17th Chapter, 15th Verse. 
" I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the 
World." 

"Not out of the world, dear Father, 

With duties and vows unfulfilled, 
With life's earnest labors unfinished, 

Ambition and passion unstilled ; 
Not out of the world, dear Father, 

Until we have faithfully tried 
To burnish the talent Thou gavest, 

And gain other talents beside. 

Not out of the world, kind Father, 

But rather our lowly life spare, 
While those Thou hast lent us from heaven 

Are needing our tenderest care ; 
Not out of the world, kind Father, 

While dear ones are trusting our arm 
To work for them hourly, and save them 

From poverty, terror, and harm. 

Not out of the world, good Father, 

Until we have suffered the loss 
Of self-loving ease and indulgence 

In willingly bearing the Cross ; 
Not out of the world, good Father, 

Till bowed with humility down, 
The weight of the Cross is forgotten 

In the golden light of the Crown. 



 

Not out of the world, our Father, 

Until we have fought a good fight, — 
Uutil to the last we have guarded 

The lamp of Thy Faith burning bright ; 
Until the long course is well finished, 

Until the hard race has been won, 
And we hear, as we rest from our labors, 

Well done, faithful servant, well done." 






CHAPTER VII. 

THE PICNIC. 

MONDAY morning, bright and early, what 

shall we do to-day ? " chanted Gem, as 

she entered the dining-room. 

" Yes ; what shall we do ? " repeated 

Tom ; " something out of the common run, of 

course, for it's vacation, and besides, it will be 

so hot pretty soon that we carCt do anything, — 

and Hugh's going to New York in the fall, — 

and Sibyl's going to Saratoga before long, and 

when I enter college, of course I shan't care 

about such things any more ; so I've got to hurry 

up."
