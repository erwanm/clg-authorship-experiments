store where he was to be employed.

He was at first occupied as stock clerk, and soon familiarized himself
with his duties. Three months later he had a summons from Mr. Sandford,
who received him in his office. There were about a hundred clerks in
the establishment, who got their orders in general from the heads of
the departments, and seldom were admitted to interviews with their
employer.

Gerald feared that he might have made some mistake and was to receive
a reprimand, but the pleasant expression on Mr. Sandford’s face
relieved him from apprehension at once.

“Sit down, Gerald,” said the merchant with a wave of the hand.

“Thank you, sir.”

“How long have you been in my employ?”

“Three months to-day, sir.”

“You are stock clerk?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Have you learned something about the stock?”

“Yes, sir, I think so.”

“Mr. Hall”—this was the superintendent—“tells me that your services
are intelligently rendered and very satisfactory.”

“I am very glad that he is satisfied with me,” said Gerald earnestly.
“I have done my best.”

“And your best seems to be very good. How would you like to travel for
the house?”

Gerald knew that the position of drummer was courted by all the
resident clerks, and was considered a distinct promotion.

“I should like it very much, sir, but do you think I am old enough?”

“You certainly are unusually young for such a position, and this, of
course, occurred to me, but you have had some experience in traveling,
though not on business, with our friend, Mr. Brooke.”

“Yes, sir.”

“And this experience will be of service to you. How old are you?”

“Nearly seventeen.”

“I have never employed a drummer under twenty, but I am nevertheless
inclined to give you a trial.”

“I will do my best for you and the house.”

“Then you will have a fair chance of succeeding. You may go and ask Mr.
Hall for instructions—I have spoken with him on the subject—and I
presume he will arrange to have you start on Monday next.”

Mr. Sandford bowed, and Gerald understood that the interview was ended.

Two weeks later Gerald found himself in Kansas City. He had had but
a fortnight’s experience as a drummer, but he had met with success
exceeding his anticipations. Though his youth was against him, and he
often found it difficult to persuade dealers that he was really an
authorized agent of a merchant so well known as Gilbert Sandford of St.
Louis, five minutes’ conversation was generally sufficient to show
that he thoroughly understood his business.

His stay in Kansas City was drawing to a close. He was a guest of the
Coates House, one of the representative hotels of the West, when he had
occasion to enter a periodical store near the hotel. It was the one
already known to us as kept by Mrs. Ferguson.

Victor Wentworth stood behind the counter and waited upon Gerald. But
he was no longer the bright and healthy boy of a few weeks back. He
had contracted malaria, and his face was pallid. Gerald could not but
notice the boy’s sick condition.

“You are not well,” he said.

“No,” answered Victor, shivering. “I don’t know what is the matter with
me.”

“How long have you been sick?” inquired Gerald.

“I was taken about a week since.”

“You ought to be at home and in bed.”

“I wish I could afford to rest,” said Victor despondently; “but I
cannot. I depend on my weekly wages.”

“Have you a home in Kansas City?”

“No; I have no relatives in this place.”

“Have you no friends who would help you while you were sick?”

Victor hesitated a moment.

“No,” he answered slowly.

“Are you an orphan?”

“No; I have a father living.”

“Ah! I understand. He is poor.”

“No,” answered Victor, shaking his head. “He is not poor. He is quite
rich.”

“Then how does it happen that you do not write to him and ask him to
help you?”

“Because he is angry with me. He is a stern man, and I offended
him very much some time since,” and Victor flushed as he made the
