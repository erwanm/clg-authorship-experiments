" Come here," said his father after the meal was con 
cluded. " I want you to tell me the exact truth about 
the bracelet. Did you break it ? " 

"No," was the. brief reply. 

" What did you do with it? " 

"I I looked at it." 

" Here, hold up your head, so. If you are telling the 
truth, you need not be ashamed. What else did you do?" 

Bertie glanced about uneasily, and picked at the buttons 
on his coat. There was a dogged look in his face, that 
betrayed a very persistent will, after all. 

"I took it out and looked at it, and put it back 
again," he said slowly. 

' ' You are very sure ? '" 

"Yes, sir." 

" Very well, Bertie, I am going to believe exactly what 


you say. I do not think you could be so cowardly or so 
dishonorable as to tell your father a falsehood. There, 
put on your hat, and take a good long run, and see if 
you cannot find a pleasanter face." 

"Barton!" exclaimed Miss Grove, while her brow 
crimsoned with anger, "you don't mean to say that you 
believe that child ! " 

" I said it certainly." 

' ' Do you suppose I could have trodden on that brace 
let (the theory you advanced last night) , and not known 
or remembered it? Maud, I know, never injured it. And 
Bertie does tell falsehoods. He will deny any thing when 
there is the slightest chance of getting clear." 

"I cannot explain the mystery, Adelaide. The boy 
would not be so hardened as to deny it without a blush 
surely : if so, it speaks badly for his past training." 

He knew that clinched the matter for his sister-in-law. 
She turned almost swarthy in her passion, being deprived 
thus of her strongest weapon. 

"Very well," she snapped. " If the child is ruined 
by your foolish indulgence, so let it be. It is what I told 
you a year ago. ' Spare the rod, and spoil the child.' I 
should have made him confess it." 

"I am afraid I don't put as much faith in Solomon's 
wisdom as you do," said the doctor dryly. "His one 
son was not a very brilliant exponent of his father's 
theory, if I recollect rightly. We have had quite enough 
of this, I fancy. I'll take your bracelet into town, and 
get it repaired." 

" Thank you. I can attend to it myself; " and she 
swept out of the hall indignantly. 

"Well," said the doctor when his mother had left 
the room, " I suppose it has ended very unsatisfactorily. 
Still I couldn't think the child would persist in a false 
hood ; and I was anxious to have the matter ended. I 
have made Adelaide very angry. Have I pleased any 
one?" 



 

"Bertie, no doubt. I have an odd feeling about it. 
I should hate to say that I was not convinced ; and, in 
any case, you did the best. It is something to a child to 
be believed." 

"I daresay Aunt Adelaide will make it up to him. 
However, she cannot abridge his playtime, nor give him 
a thrashing. Do you want to go out with me ? If so, be 
ready in half an hour. ' ' 

Bertie's school-bell rang ten minutes earlier than usual ; 
and it always rang fifteen minutes before the time, in order 
to give him a chance to get in, and wash his hands and face 
before school-hours began. These few minutes were a 
great gratification to Miss Grove. Then Bertie had his ears 
snapped soundly until they were like a bit of red flannel. 
Boxing had been interdicted by the doctor. In fact, the 
whole morning was one continuation of sundry small and 
aggravated punishments, which made Bertie dull at his 
lessons, and perfect!}" vicious in his hatred of his aunt. 
If he dared to tell his stepmother ! "Wouldn't she take 
his part again ? 

Nelly had not been at all satisfied with the doctor's 
manner of examining into the case. The child had been 
disobedient to his aunt, ugly to his sister, and cowardly 
at the end of it all. But, seen in the morning light, the 
affair appeared trivial to his father ; and he was glad to 
dismiss it with as few words as possible. However, she 
made no further comment. There was nothing small or 
nagging in her nature. 

But that afternoon, when she saw Bertie cross the field 
on his way to the grove, she tied on her sun-hat, and fol 
lowed him. When quite out of hearing of the house, she 
called to him. He watched her shyly at first, and did not 
seem inclined to be very friendly. But, after a while, he 
ventured to sit down beside her. 

" Oh ! what are you doing, Bertie? " she cried in sur 
prise.
