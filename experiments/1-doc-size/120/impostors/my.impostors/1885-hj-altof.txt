tall fireplaces, side by side, with a delicate gallery 
running along the top of them, constitute the originality 
of this ancient chamber, and make one think of the 
groups that must formerly have gathered there, of 
all the wet boot-soles, the trickling doublets, the 
stiffened fingers, the rheumatic shanks, that must have 
been presented to such an incomparable focus of 
heat. To-day, I am afraid, these mighty hearts are 
forever cold; justice is probably administered with the 
aid of a modern caloriftre, and the walls of the palace 
are perforated with regurgitating tubes. Behind and 
above the gallery that surmounts the three fireplaces 
are high Gothic windows, the tracery of which masks, 
in some sort, the chimneys; and in each angle of this 
and of the room to the right and left of the trio of 
chimneys, is an open-work spiral staircase, ascending 
to I forget where; perhaps to the roof of the edifice. 
This whole side of the salle is very lordly, and seems 
to express an unstinted hospitality, to extend the 
friendliest of all invitations, to bid the whole world 
come and get warm. It was the invention of John, 
Duke of Berry and Count of Poitou, about 1395. I 
give this information on the authority of the Guide- 
Joanne, from which source I gather much other curious 



  

learning; as, for instance, that it was in this building, 
when it had surely a very different front, that Charles VII. 
was proclaimed king, in 1422; and that here Jeanne 
Dare was subjected, in 1429, to the inquisition of 
certain doctors and matrons. 

The most charming thing at Poitiers is simply the 
Promenade de Blossac, a small public garden at one 
end of the flat top of the hill. It has a happy look 
of the last century (having been arranged at that 
period), and a beautiful sweep of view over the sur 
rounding country, and especially of the course of the 
little river Clain, which winds about a part of the base 
of the big mound of Poitiers. The limit of this dear 
little garden is formed, on the side that turns away 
from the town, by the rampart erected in the fourteenth 
century, and by its big semicircular bastions. This 
rampart, of great length, has a low parapet; you look 
over it at the charming little vegetable-gardens with 
which the base of the hill appears exclusively to be 
garnished. The whole prospect is delightful, especially 
the details of the part just under the walls, at the end 
of the walk. Here the river makes a shining twist, 
which a painter might have invented, and the side of 
the hill is terraced into several ledges, a sort of 
tangle of small blooming patches and little pavilions 
with peaked roofs and green shutters. It is idle to 
attempt to reproduce all this in words; it should be 
reproduced only in water-colors. The reader, how 
ever, will already have remarked that disparity in 
these ineffectual pages, which are pervaded by the 





attempt to sketch without a palette or brushes. He will 
doubtless, also, be struck with the grovelling vision 
which, on such a spot as the ramparts of Poitiers, 
peoples itself with carrots and cabbages rather than 
with images of the Black Prince and the captive king. 
I am not sure that in looking out from the Promenade 
de Blossac you command the old battle-field; it is 
enough that it was not far off, and that the great rout 
of Frenchmen poured into the walls of Poitiers, leav 
ing on the ground a number of the fallen equal to 
the little army (eight thousand) of the invader. I did 
think of the battle. I wondered, rather helplessly, 
Avhere it had taken place; and I came away (as the 
reader will see from the preceding sentence) without 
finding out. This indifference, however, was a result 
rather of a general dread of military topography than 
of a want of admiration of this particular victory, 
which I have always supposed to be one of the most 
brilliant on record. Indeed, I should be almost 
ashamed, and very much at a loss, to say what light 
it was that this glorious day seemed to me to have 
left forever on the horizon, and why the very name of 
the place had always caused my blood gently to tingle. 
It is carrying the feeling of race to quite inscrutable 
lengths when a vague American permits himself an 
emotion because more than five centuries ago, on 
French soil, one rapacious Frenchman got the better 
of another. Edward was a Frenchman as well as 
John, and French were the cries that urged each of 
the hosts to the fight. French is the beautiful motto 



  

graven round the image of the Black Prince, as he 
lies forever at rest in the choir of Canterbury: a la 
mort ne pensai-je mye. Nevertheless, the victory of 
Poitiers declines to lose itself in these considerations; 
the sense of it is a part of our heritage, the joy of it 
a part of our imagination, and it filters down through 
centuries and migrations till it titillates a New Yorker 
who forgets in his elation that he happens at that 
moment to be enjoying the hospitality of France. It 
was something done, I know not how justly, for Eng 
land; and what was done in the fourteenth century 
for England was done also for New York.

IF it was really for the sake of the Black Prince

Notre Dame la Grande and of the little temple of St.
