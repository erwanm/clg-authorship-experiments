some day he would enter into this estate. Between 
him and the beach stood the sum of six hundred 
dollars. 

But one thing troubled him, and because of it he 
might never arrive on the beach. A new inexplicable 
madness that urged him to shrill ironically the story 
of his coat —  to take it off and fling it at the feet of 
any stranger who chanced to be nigh. 

"Look at it!" he felt like screaming. "Clean and 
spotless, but beginning to show the wear and tear of 
constant use. I have worn it for weeks and weeks. 
I have slept with it under vay pillow. Observe it — 
a blue-serge coat. Ever hear of the djinn in the 
bottle? Like enough. But did you ever hear of a 
djinn in a blue-serge coat? Stitched in!" 

Something like this was always rushing into his 
throat; and he had to sink his nails into his palms to 
stop his mouth. Very fascinating, though, trying to 
analyse the impulse. It was not an affair of the 
conscience; it was vaguely based upon insolence and 





defiance. He wondered if these abnormal mental 
activities presaged illness. To be ill and helpless; 

He went on munching his water-chestnuts, and 
stared at the skyline. He hated horizons. He was 
always visuaKzing the Hand whenever he let his 
gaze rest upon the horizon. An enormous Hand 
that rose up swiftly, blotting out the sky. A Hand 
that strove to reach his shoulder, relentless, soulless 
but lawful. The scrutiny of any strange man pro- 
voked a sweaty terror. What a God-forsaken fool he 
was ! And dinJy , out there somewhere in the South 
Seas — the beach ! 

Already he sensed the fascination of the inevitable; 
and with this fascination came the idea of haste, to 
get there quickly and have done. Odd, but he had 
never thought of the beach until this girl (who looked 
as if she had stepped out of the family album) re- 
ferred to it with a familiarity which was as astonish- 
ing as it was profoundly sad. 

The beach : to get there as quickly as he could, to 
reach the white man's nadir of abasement and 
gather the promise of that soothing indiflFerence which 
comes with the final disintegration of the fibres of 
conscience. He had an objective now. 




CHAPTER IV 

(HE tourists returned to the Sha-mien at four 
o'clock. They were silent and no longer 
observant, being more or less exhaused by the 
tedious action of the chairs. Even Ah Cum had 
resumed his Oriental shell of reserve. To reach the 
Sha-mien —  and particularly the Hotel Victoria — one 
crossed a narrow canal, always choked with rocking 
sampans over and about which swarmed yellow men 
and women and children in varied shades of faded 
blue cotton. At simset the swarming abruptly 
ceased; even the sampans appeared to draw closer 
together, with the quiet of water-fowl. There is 
everywhere at night in China the original fear of 
darkness. 

From the portals of the hotel — scarcely fifty yards 
from the canal — one saw the blank face of the 
ancient city of Canton. Blank it was, except for a 
gate near the bridgehead. Into this hole in the wall 
and out of it the native stream flowed from sunrise 
to sunset, when the stream mysteriously ceased. 
The silence of Canton at night was sinister, for none 
could prophesy what form of mob might suddenly 
boil out. 
No Cantonese was in those days permitted to 


cross to the Sha-mien after sunset without a license. 
To simplify matters, he carried a coloured paper 
lantern upon which his license number was painted in 
Arabic numerals. It added to the picturesqueness 
of the Sha-mien night to observe these gaily coloured 
lanterns dancing hither and yon like June fireflies in a 
meadow. 

Meantime the spinsters sought the dining room 
where tea was being served. They had much to talk 
about, or rather Miss Prudence had. 

"But she is a dear," said Angelina, timidly. 

"I'll admit that. But I don't understand her; 
she's over my head. She leaves me almost without 
comparisons. She is like some character out of Phra 
the Phoenician: she's been buried for thirty years and 
just been excavated. That's the way she strikes me. 
And it's imcanny." 

"But I never saw anybody more alive." 

"Who wouldn't be Kvely after thirty years' sleep? 
Did you hear her explain about beachcombers? And 
yet she looks at one with the straightest glance I 
ever saw. StiD, I'm glad she didn't accept my in- 
vitation to join us. I shouldn't care to have 
attention constantly drawn to us. This world over 
here! Everything's upside-down or back-end-to. 
Humph!"
