spring began to muffle the rugged old city with its tremu 
lous festoons it seemed to him that he had done a hand 
some winter 's work and had fairly earned a holiday. He 
took a liberal one, and lounged away the lovely Roman 
May, doing nothing. He looked very contented ; with 
himself perhaps at times a trifle too obviously. But who 
could have said without good reason? He was "flushed 
with triumph ; " this classic phrase portrayed him to 
Rowland 's sense. He would lose himself in long re- 



 

varies, and emerge from them with a quickened smile and 
heightened colour. Rowland grudged him none of his 
smiles, and took an extreme satisfaction in his two statues. 
He had these productions transported to his own apart 
ment, and one warm evening in May he gave a little 
dinner in honour of the artist. It was small, but Row 
land had meant it should TDC very agreeably composed. 
He thought over his friends, and chose four. They were 
all persons with whom he lived in a certain intimacy. 



VI. 

ONE of them was an American sculptor of French ex 
traction, or remotely perhaps of Italian, for he rejoiced 
in the somewhat fervid name of Gloriani. He was a 
man of forty, he had been living for years in Paris and 
in Rome, and he now drove a very pretty trade in sculp 
ture of the ornamental and fantastic sort. In his youth 
he had had money ; but he had spent it recklessly, much 
of it scandalously, and at twenty-six had found himself 
obliged to make capital of his talent. This was quite 
inimitable, and fifteen years of indefatigable exercise had 
brought it to perfection. Rowland admitted its power, 
though it gave him very little pleasure ; what he relished 
in the man was the extraordinary vivacity and frankness, 
not to call it the impudence, of his opinions. He had a 
definite, practical scheme of art, and he knew at least 
what he meant. In this sense he was solid and com 
plete. There were so many of the aesthetic fraternity 
who were floundering in unknown seas, without a notion 
of which way their noses were turned, that Gloriani, 
conscious and compact, unlimitedly intelligent and con 
summately clever, dogmatic only as to his own duties, 
and at once gracefully deferential and profoundly indif- 



 

ferent to those of others, had for Rowland a certain in 
tellectual refreshment quite independent of the character 
of his works. These were considered by most people to 
belong to a very corrupt, and by many to a positively 
indecent, school. Others thought them tremendously 
knowing, and paid enormous prices for them ; and indeed 
to be able to point to one of Gloriani 's figures in a shady 
corner of your library was tolerable proof that you were 
not a fool. Corrupt things they certainly were ; in the 
line of sculpture they were quite the latest fruit of time. 
It was the artist 's opinion that there is no essential dif 
ference between beauty and ugliness ; that they overlap 
and intermingle in a quite inextricable manner ; that 
there is no saying where one begins and the other ends ; 
that hideousness grimaces at you suddenly from out of 
the very bosom of loveliness, and beauty blooms before 
your eyes in the lap of vileness j that it is a waste of wit 
to nurse metaphysical distinctions, and a sadly meagre 
entertainment to caress imaginary lines ; that the thing 
to aim at is the expressive, and the way to reach it is by 
ingenuity ; that for this purpose everything may serve, 
and that a consummate work is a sort of hotch-potch of 
the pure and the impure, the graceful and the grotesque. 
Its prime duty is to amuse, to puzzle, to fascinate, to 
savour of a complex imagination. Gloriani 's statues 
were florid and meretricious ; they looked like magnified 
goldsmith 's work. They were extremely elegant, but 
they had no charm for Rowland. He never bought one, 
but Gloriani was such an independent fellow, and was 
withal so deluged with orders, that this made no differ 
ence in their friendship. The artist might have passed 
for a Frenchman. He was a great talker, and a very 
picturesque one ; he was almost bald ; he had a small 
bright eye, a broken nose, and a moustache with waxed 
ends. When sometimes he received you at his lodging, 
he introduced you to a lady with a plain face whom he 
called Madame Gloriani which she was not. 





Rowland 's second guest was also an artist, but of a very 
different type. His friends called him Sam Singleton ; 
he was an American, and he had been in Rome a couple 
of years. He painted small landscapes, chiefly in water- 
colours ; Rowland had seen one of them in a shop window, 
had liked it extremely, and ascertaining his address, had 
gone to see him and found him established in a very 
humble studio near the Piazza Barberini, where appa 
rently fame and fortune had not yet found him out. 
Rowland took a fancy to him and bought several of his 
pictures ; Singleton made few speeches, but he was grate 
ful. Rowland heard afterwards that when he first came 
to Rome he painted worthless daubs and gave no promise 
of talent. Improvement had come, however, hand in 
hand with patient industry, and his talent, though of a 
slender and delicate order, was now incontestable. It 
was as yet but scantily recognised, and he had hard 
work to live. Rowland hung his little water-colours on 
the library wall, and found that as he lived with them he 
grew very fond of them. Singleton was a diminutive 
attenuated personage ; he looked like a precocious child. 
He had a high protuberant forehead, a transparent brown 
eye, a perpetual smile, an extraordinary expression of
