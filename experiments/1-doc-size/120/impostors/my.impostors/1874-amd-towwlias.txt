The veil was raised. Oh, that face, with all its fairness and beauty;
the golden hair, the lustrous eyes! They all knew then.

"O Granny, Granny!" and Florence was kneeling at her grandmother's
feet, kissing the wasted hands, her sad, pathetic voice broken with
sobs. "I had to come: I couldn't stay away. I've been selfish and
ungrateful, and God has punished me sorely. And, when I turned to
him in my sorrow, he brought before me all my neglect, my pride, my
cruelty. O Granny! can it be forgiven?"

"There's nothing to forgive, child."

She kissed the sweet, wet face. At that moment she forgot every thing
save that this darling had come back.

"Yes, there is so much, so much! You don't know. For, after I was
married, I might have come. Edmund was tender and noble. This is my
husband, Mr. Darol."

She rose as she uttered this, and made a gesture with her outstretched
hand. Mr. Darol bowed.

"This is my dear grandmother Edmund; and these are my brothers and
sisters. It is so long since I have seen any of you, that you seem
strangers to me."

There was a peculiar silence in the room.

"Oh!" with a low, imploring cry,--"have you no welcome for me? Have I
forfeited all regard, all remembrance?"

Hal came round to her side; but she was so stately and beautiful, that
he felt almost awed.

"It is Hal, I know. Oh! take me back in your midst: for only yesterday
I buried my little baby; and I know now the sense of loss that I
entailed upon you."

They all crowded round her then. Not one had forgotten darling Flossy.
Kisses and fond clasps. They were so glad to take her into their circle.

"This is Joe," she said, "and Kit, and Dot. O Charlie! to see you all
once more! and to have you all alive! For I have been haunted with
a terrible fear lest some of you might have fallen out of the old
home-chain. Not a break, thank God!"

Then she brought them to her husband. Oh, how wild she had been when
she fancied that she might be ashamed of them!--this group of brave,
loving faces, full of the essential elements of nobility.

Ah, Florence, if you had known all their deeds of simple heroism!

Charlie helped her take off her wrappings. She had not changed greatly,
except to grow older and more womanly.

"Granny has been ill!" she exclaimed in quick alarm.

"Yes, nearly all winter. But she is better now. O Flossy, I am so glad
you came to-day!" and Hal's soft eyes swam in tears.

"It was Christmas. I could not help thinking of the dear old Christmas
when we were all together. O Hal! if you could know all my shame and
sorrow!"

"Joe," said Granny feebly, "will you take me back to bed? I'm tired
again. I'm a poor old body at the best. Then you can come and sit round
me."

"Shall I send the driver away?" asked Mr. Darol of Florence.

"Yes: I can't leave them to-night. You will not mind?"--

She glanced around as she uttered this, as if apologizing for the poor
accommodations.

"No, I shall not mind," in a grave tone.

Granny was carried to bed again. Hal shook up the pillow, and
straightened the spreads. Joe laid her in tenderly, saying, as he
kissed her,--

"You have us all home again in the old shoe!"

The room was neat and orderly; poor, to be sure, but with a cheerful
air. Hal brought in the flowers, and Kit some chairs, and they made
quite a party.

"But think of the dishes!" whispered housewifely Dot. "And not a clean
one for morning, we've used so many. But, oh! wasn't it elegant? And
Florence is a real lady!"

"We had better slip out, and look after our household gods," Hal
murmured in return.

Before they were fairly in the business, Charlie joined them.

"Let me help too," she said. "I don't hate to wash dishes quite as much
as I used; and I am so happy to-night that I could do almost any thing!"

They were a practical exemplification of the old adage. Many hands did
make light work. In a little while they had their house in order.

"But what a family!" exclaimed Dot. "Where are we to put them all?"

"I've been thinking. Florence and her husband can have my room, and we
will make a bed for Kit and Joe in the flower-room. They won't mind it,
I guess."

"Dot can sleep with Granny, and I can curl up in any corner for
to-night," said Charlie.

"Hal never had a wink of sleep last night. We talked and sang Christmas
hymns, and Granny thought that she would not live."

Charlie gave a sad sigh.

"You are angels, both of you," she answered. "And when Mr. Darol
comes,--oh! isn't it funny that Florence's husband should have the same
name? I wonder"--
