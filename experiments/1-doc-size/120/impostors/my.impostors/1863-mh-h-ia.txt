conduct that preceded it ; his supposed infidelity and duplicity ; the old tide of fostering fondness for his young, hand 
some brother joined with anguish at his loss, and deep repentance for the rank injustice he had done that gentle, 





noble spirit, in thought and speech, and swelled his heart 
almost to bursting. There was no time to be wasted in 
unavailing lamentations, or he must have bowed before the 
torrent of feeling and memory that flowed at sight of many 
familiar, and now sacred relics. The homeliest article of ap 
parel Robert's hunting suit, the heavy, muddy boots he 
had worn upon their last tramp through the low grounds 
a stained and shapeless straw hat, discarded as past worthy 
when the fishing season was over, and left, forgotten and 
useless, hanging upon a peg in the closet ; these had become 
! most precious in his sight. 

One master emotion drove him onward in the work to 

which he believed destiny had appointed him ; forced him 

porward over the graves of early and dear association and 

jater loves; forbade the burning, bloodshot eyes the inlulgence of a tear the aching heart the relief of a sigh. 

Fustice -justice, swift and awful, upon the head of his 

Brother's destroyer ! He was not malignant or vindictive 

by nature, but he experienced a savage thrill of exultation 

on the thought that the bloodhound Detection was ready to 

spring at the murderer's throat, ready, and straining at 

he leash, which he the rightful avenger of blood held. 

"At last!" 

He had feared lest he might not recognize the garment he 
ought ; yet he knew it at a glance, as it was revealed by 
in opening drawer of the wardrobe. It lay uppermost, 
,moothly folded, the wrong side out, but he recollected the 
glossy black silk, and its tiny embroidered rose-bud, in the portion of the fabric composing the collar. He snatched it 
ip, then stood for a moment, powerless to end his anxiety 
: &gt;y further examination. He had to summon physical nerve 
with moral resolution before he thrust his fingers in tremling desperation into the pocket. They touched a paper, 
ragged it forth an envelope directed to " Mr. Robert Lay, 





Greenfield," and bearing in one corner the words " by Ga 
briel." He was obliged to sit down to read it, he was so ut 
terly weak. The ink was very pale, the pen-strokes delicate. 
An exclamation of extreme impatience escaped him at the 
trifling delay caused by the necessity of approaching a win 
dow before he could decipher the few lines upon which 
depended so much. 

" Robert" he read " I am very, very sad to-day, and 
there is no one excepting yourself to whom I can speak of 
my great trouble. It would do me good, be an unspeaka 
ble comfort, if I could have one, just one more talk with you 
before there is put between us a barrier that must last for a 
lifetime. Believe me, I am not jealous of Helen's superior 
claims. I pray hourly for your happiness and hers; yet I 
cannot help feeling lonely now that I am about to lose my 
brother my best I had almost said, my only friend ! If 
you have a half hour to spare this morning, will you not
meet me at ten o'clock under the spruce pine? the pic-nic
ground, you remember ! It is not so far from the road
to the court-house that you win lose much time in comply 
ing with this, as it may seem to you, bold request. I will 
explain my reasons for making it when we meet. Until 
then, trust me so far as to believe them good and sufficient. 
What I have to say concerns you no less than myself. Do 
not disappoint me ! I shall wait for you until twelve 
o'clock. Your fond sister, LILY." 

Five minutes later, Aleck stood upon the piazza and shout 
ed to a negro in the stable-yard 

"Ben! saddle Hero, and bring him around directly! 
directly ! do you hear ?" 

" Hero, did you say, Mars Aleck ?" said the man, coming 
nearer. 






 

" Hero ! and hurry ! are you deaf ?" 

The groom shook his head as he disappeared in the stable, 
mplying that he could say much more on the subject if he 
?ared to risk further parley with his impatient superior. 

While he waited, Aleck walked the porch-floor fast and 
uriously ; gnawed his lip, as was his trick in moments of 
ntense excitement ; drew his breath in hot pants, like a wild 
inimal thirsting for prey. Hero was led around to the door, 
 splendid creature, full-blooded and thoroughly trained, 
stepping high and daintily. 

How poor Robert loved that horse ! The brother's look 
was not less fierce in the recollection, but the pat upon the 
arched neck, the word of salutation " Hero old fellow !" 
hat accompanied the hand caress, were signals of the inward 
bought. 

"He's dreadful skittish now-a-days, Mars Aleck!" cau- 
ioned the hostler, respectfully. " Not a man on this place
