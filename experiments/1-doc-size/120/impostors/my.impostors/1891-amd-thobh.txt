But they meet in outward friendliness on this occasion. 
Some of the laity are invited to express their hopes and 
opinions, and announce that once a week the hall will be 
opened for political, economic, or other discussions. Alto- 
gether it is a success, and to Winterburne and the com- 
mittee is given a vote of thanks. The reading-rooms are 
to be opened every evening, and Armitage has a project of 
special classes meeting on two evenings during the week. 

The school has opened its doors on Monday of this event- 
ful week. When Cynthia inspects her scholars they are 
indeed a motley group. Two young women with babies in 
their arms have brought some garments that puzzle their 
brains and are almost beyond Cynthia's ingenuity. She 
gently announces that afternoons are to be devoted to sew- 
ing. There are little children the mothers are glad to get out 
of the way, there are larger girls in various stages of untidi- 
ness. Eegina Halford would shrink in dismay. Cynthia 
is amused. It is a Dickens picture, the - noses of every 
variety, the mouths untrained in positive expression with 
loosely hanging lips, and eyes full of half-vacant, half-won- 
dering expressions. 

She has seen a number of them in her visits to cottages 
whither Miss Hilliard went on errands of kindliness. 
Others have bobbed a short courtesy to her in the street 
and been rewarded with a smile, so they are not quite 
strangers. Some of them read very lamely, some not at 
all. A few have been to school, but most of the larger ones 
have had babies to care for since they were babies them- 
selves. The majority of them are of old country descent. 

She finds that a number of them can sing, so they have a 
lesson in that. There is spelling in concert, counting, add- 
ing, — all oral teaching ; and noon comes quite too soon. 
Several have brought their luncheons, those mostly with 



 

little sisters or brothers. Cynthia questions them in her 
bright, entertaining fashion, giving them some lessons in 
cleanliness, telling them wonderful things about their skins, 
their eyes, their teeth, and hair. 

Just as the others straggle in Mr. Armitage ventures to 
present himself. 

" I was anxious to know if you were appalled at the un- 
dertaking," he asks, glancing around at the motley crew. 
" What could you do with these — babies ? " looking dis- 
mayed himself. 

"The babies as you call them have one corner and some 
blocks. As soon as they quarrel and fight they are com- 
pelled to leave the charmed circle and sit in solitary medi- 
tation. They have had two lessons in letters and are 
learning to count. I have a small monitor to watch them. 
You see, their sisters have to bring them. We allowed for 
that." 

He studies the bright, animated face. Is there a certain 
joyousness in work that he has not yet comprehended to 
its fullest extent ? 

"I supposed" — then he pauses helplessly. 

" You didn't suppose they were to be clean and tidy and 
angelic the first day ? That I was to sit among them like 
a queen, they obeying promptly if I so much as lifted my 
little finger," and she gives a dainty twirl to it as she 
smiles engagingly. 

"I am afraid it is going to be harder on you than I 
thought. And you have not been used to this sort of 
thing." 

" I am fertile in expedients. I have one womanly vir- 
tue : I practically take the shortest cut when I have any- 
thing to do, as women are credited with in their reasoning 
processes. Why not? Now you shall hear them sing." 

Alas ! they are all stricken with bashfulness. They cail 
sing in the streets and on their own porches, perhaps a 
large promiscuous audience is less to be feared. They look 
at each other with very red faces. A few venture to follow 
Miss Halford, then drop out iguominiously, while their 





companions giggle softly with their hands over their 
mouths. 

Cynthia laughs good-humoredly. " We are all afraid of 
the minister." Tlieii in an undertone, bringing her bronze 
brown head so near he can see the golden shimmer in a 
stray curl, she adds : " We are not quite up to visitors. 
This is a case where assurance does not really assure." 

Two of the girls have sickness at home that he inquires 
about, and leaves Miss Halford to her own devices. They 
go through some calisthenics, and she gives them an easy 
lesson in physiology. They sew, and she reads them a 
story, rather broken in its serene flow by needles going 
astray, and thread getting into obstinate knots ; hems that 
have an unfortunate tendency to widen out or narrow in, 
rather than follow the straight line of duty. Cynthia is 
compelled to hand her book to one of the girls and go on a 
tour of assistance. Then the younger ones demand her 
attention. 

Presently two of the mothers come in, one a snug-looking 
Scotch woman who goes out washing to get bread for her 
two bairns. 

" It's a godsend for such as me," she says smilingly.
