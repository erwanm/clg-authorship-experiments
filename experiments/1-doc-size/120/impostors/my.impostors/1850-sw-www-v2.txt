looked a little as if she felt herself out of her sphere. " I
didn't know as you would care to see me now." 

" I am very sorry you should think so, Nancy ; I would 
be as glad to see you as ever. I have not forgotten all your 
old kindness to me when aunt Fortune was sick." 

" You've forgotten all that went before that, I s'pose," said 
Nancy with a half laugh. " You beat all ! Most folks remember and forget just t'other way exactly. But besides, 
I did'nt know but I should catch myself in queer company." 

" Well — I am all alone now," said Ellen with a sigh. 
" Yes, if you warn't I wouldn't be here, I can tell you, 
What do you think I have come for to-day, Ellen ?" 
" For anything but to see me ?" 
Nancy nodded very decisively. 
"What?" 
" Guess." 

How can I possibly guess ? What have you got lucked 
up in your apron there ?" 

Ah ! — that's the very thing," said Nancy. " What have 
I got, sure enough ?" 

" Well, I can't tell through your apron, " said Ellen 
smiling. 

" And I can't tell either ; — that's more, aint it ? Now 
listen, and I'll tell you where I got it, and then you may find 
out what it is, for I don't know. Promise you won't tell any- 
body." 

"I don't like to promise that, Nancy." 
" Why ?" 

" Because it might be something I ought to tell somebody 
about." 

" But it aint." 

" If it isn't I won't tell. Can't you leave it so ?" 
But what a plague ! Here I have gone and done all this 
just for you, and now you must go and make a fuss. What 
hurt would it do you to promise ? — it's nobody's business but 
yours and mine, and somebody else's that won't make any 
talk about it I promise you." 

" I won't speak of it certainly, Nancy, unless I think I 
ought ; can't you trust me ?" 

" I wouldn't give two straws for anybody else's say so," said 







Nancy ; — " but as you're as stiff as the mischief I s'pose I'll 
have to let it go. I'll trust you ! Now hsten. It don't look 
like anything, does it ?" 

" Why no," said Ellen laughing ; " you hold your apron so 
loose that I cannot see anything." 

" Well now listen. You know I've been helping down at 
your aunt's, — did you ?" 

" No." 

" Well I have, — these six weeks. You never see anything 
go on quieter than they do, Ellen. I declare it's fun. Miss 
Fortune never was so good in her days. I don't mean she 
aint as ugly as ever, you know, but she has to keep it in. All 
I have to do if I think anything is going wrong, I just let her 
think I am going to speak to him about it ; — only I have to 
do it very cunning for fear she would guess what I am up to ; 
and the next thinof I know it's all straii^ht. He is about the 
coolest shaver," said Nancy, I ever did see. The way he 
walks through her notions once in a while — not very often, 
mind you, but when he takes a fancy, — it's fun to see ! I 
can get along there first-rate now. You'd have a royal time, 
Ellen." 

" Well, Nancy — your story ?" 
Don't you be in a hurry ! I am going to take my time. 
Well I've been there this six weeks ; doing all sorts of things, 
you know ; taking your place, Ellen ; don't you wish you was 
back in it ? — Well a couple of weeks since, Mrs. Van took it 
into her head she would have up the wagon and go to Thirlwall to get herself some things ; a queer start for her ; but at 
any rate Van Brunt brought up the wagon and in she got and 
off they went. Now she meant, you must know, that I should 
be fast in the cellar-kitchen all the while she was gone, and 
she thought she had given me enough to keep me busy there ; 
but [ was up to her ! I was as spry as a cricket, and flew 
round, and got things put up ; and then I thought I'd have 
some fun. What d-o you think I did ? — Mrs. Montgomery 
was quietly sitting in the chimney-corner and I had the 
whole house to myself. How Van Brunt looks out for her, 
Ellen ; he won't let her be put out for anything or anybody." 

" I am glad of it," said Ellen, her face flushing and her eyes 
watering ; " it is just like him. I love him for it." 

" The other night she was mourning and lamenting at a 







great rate because she hadn't you to read to her ; and what 
do you think he does but goes and takes the book and sits 
down and reads to her himself. You should have seen Mrs. 
Van's face !" 

" What book said Ellen.
