" No. But I thought you said that it was my duty 
to do what I wished." 

" Well, yes. That is what I said," Miss Mil ray 
consented. " But I supposed that you knew already." 

" No," said Clementina, candidly, " I don 't believe 
I do." 

" And what if you don 't see him ? " 

" I guess I shall have to wait till I do. The e will 
be time enough." 

Miss Milray sighed, and then she laughed. " You 
are young ! " 



XXXII. 

Miss Milray went from Clementina to call upon her 
sister-in-law, and found her brother, which was per 
haps what she hoped might happen. 

" Do you know," she said, " that that old wretch is 
going to defraud that poor thing, after all, and leave 
her money to her husband 's half-sister 's children ? " 

" You wish me to infer the Mrs. Lander-Clementina 
situation ? " Milray returned. 

" Yes ! " 

" I 'm glad you put it in terms that are not action 
able, then ; for your words are decidedly libellous." 

" What do you mean ? " 

" I 've  just been writing Mrs. Lander 's will for her, 
and she 's left all her property to Clementina, except 
five thousand apiece to the half-sister 's three children." 

" I can 't believe it ! " 

"Well," said Milray, with his gentle smile, "I 
think that 's safe ground for you. Mrs. Lander will 
probably have time enough to change her will as well 
as her mind several times yet before she dies. The 
half-sister 's children may get their rights yet." 

" I wish they might ! " said Miss Milray, with an 



 

impassioned sigh. " Then perhaps I should get Clem 
entina for a while." 

Her brother laughed. " Isn 't there somebody else 
wants Clementina ? " 

" Oh, plenty. But she 's not sure she wants any 
body else." 

" Does she want you ? " 

" No, I can 't say she does. She wants to go home." 

" That 's not a bad scheme. I should like to go 
home myself if I had one. What would you have 
done with Clementina if you had got her, Jenny ? " 

" What would any one have done with her ? Mar 
ried her brilliantly, of course." 

" But you say she isn 't sure she wishes to be mar 
ried at all ? " 

Miss Milray stated the case of Clementina 's divided 
mind, and her belief that she would take Hinkle in 
the end, together with the fear that she might take 
Gregory. " She 's very odd," Miss Milray concluded. 
"She puzzles me. Why did you ever send her to 
me?" 

Milray laughed. " I don 't know. I thought she 
would amuse you, and I thought it would be a pleas 
ure to her." 

They began to talk of some affairs of their own, 
from which Miss Milray returned to Clementina with 
the ache of an imperfectly satisfied intention. If she 
had meant to urge her brother to seek justice for the 
girl from Mrs. Lander, she was not so well pleased to 
have found justice done already. But the will had 
been duly signed and witnessed before the American 



 

vice-consul, and she must get what good she could 
out of an accomplished fact. It was at least a conso 
lation to know that it put an end to her sister-in-law 's 
patronage of the girl, and it would be interesting to 
see Mrs. Milray adapt her behavior to Clementina 's 
fortunes. She did not really dislike her sister-in-law 
enough to do her a wrong ; she was only willing that 
she should do herself a wrong. 

But one of the most disappointing things in all 
hostile operations is that you never can know what 
the enemy would be at ; and Mrs. Milray 's manoeuvres 
were sometimes dictated by such impulses that her 
strategy was peculiarly baffling. The thought of her 
past unkindness to Clementina may still have rankled 
in her, or she may simply have felt the need of out
