Fan had one little say though her eyes were 
bright with tears. 

tk I hope I can be as good and sweet in my 
life as mamma has been in hers. And I will 
not ask any liigln-r happiness." 



 



We walked up the church aisle. The chil- 
dren stood around, back of them Louis, Nelly 
and mamma, and then a host of eager parish 
faces. Does any one take it all in then, the sol- 
emn questions, the still more solemn promises ? 

Mr. Churchill gave us both away. Papa's 
voice had a little falter in it, and I dared not 
look up. " For better, for worse," " till death do 
us part," rang clearly in heart and brain. The 
forever of human love, when it is love and no 
base counterfeit. 

A little kissing, a few tears, some tremulous 
whispers and sad, sad good-byes. We whose 
farthest journey had been the brief sojourn at 
Martha's Vineyard, took up the great pilgrimage 
of a new life. 



I cannot tell you anything about it, or Stephen. 
It was a happy confusion of strange places and 
watchful care, bits of affection shining out of 
the tiniest rift. Honeymoons, I suppose, are 
much alike, but it is right for each to think 
his and hers the best and most delightful. 

One afternoon the carriage set us down in so 



 

quiet a street that I could hardly believe it was 
New York. And when I entered the house my 
new house, I doubted more than ever, for every- 
body was there. One kissed me until I thought 
the breath of life was surely gone, then another 
took me up. I have a dim suspicion that my 
sleeves were worn threadbare, and if my hair 
had not been all fast in my head, I am afraid 
the difference would have been discoverable. 

" Why you are rounder and rosier than ever!' 
declared Fan, inspecting me. 

She was elegant as a princess, and had her 
light silk dress trimmed with applique lace. 

It seemed as if I never could get done look- 
ing at mamma, and papa hovered around me as 
if I was indeed an unusual si^ht. 


Somehow I managed to get up-stairs to my 
own pretty room, to wash my face, what there 
was left of it, and straighten my gown. And 
there was Beauty, my lovely half-grown kitten 
that some one had brought from the old home. 

I heard Stuart's voice outside the door and 
called him in. 

Stuart," I said with rnuoh dignity, "this is 
Miss Beauty Endicott, a nice, orderly, well 
brought-up kitten, and mine. I want you to 

respect her and treat her with the courtesy of 
a gentleman." 

"Oh, fudge!' he returned. "What are you 
doing with a kitten when you are married ? I 
thought it was only old maids who were death 
on cats." 

"It is boys who are death on cats;' I replied 
severely. "And then I never did expect to 
be married. I always supposed ' 

" Oh, you couldn't have been an old maid ! 
your nose never can be sharp, and your chin 
has that great dimple in it, and you are such a 
funny little dumpling altogether! If you say 
much I'll put you in my pocket and carry you 
off. No doubt Stephen would feel immensely 
relieved, but what could the cat do ? ' 

"You are an incorrigible boy!' 

"But we will have jolly times for all that," 
and he whistled to Tim, who put her head within 
the door. 

"Fan," I exclaimed with remorseful tender- 
ness as I was going down stairs with her arm 
over my shoulder ; "I have Mrs. Whit comb. 
But you know you half gave her to Stephen. . 
And as you are not to keep house - 

" I will lend her to you a little while longer." 

"We had such a merry, enjoyable supper, such 
a lovely long evening, and were brimfull of 
happiness. 

But the next morning papa gathered up his
