Elizabeth, did you ever imagine the perfectly natural 
man and think how happy he must be? " 

"No," she said, not even noticing his use of her 
name. 

' He will grow up with a sound body. Every sense 
will be so perfect that ordinary uses of life, which we 
only count means to its preservation, will be sweet as 
our first spring days the perfect ones when we sleep 
soundly till dawn, and wake to be glad we are alive. 
Haven't you seen such days ? ' 

' Never till this spring." It was an unguarded slip. 
How should she have realized yet whether her pulses' 
quickening depended on the new budding of the 
world, or on some miraculous spiritual change of her 
own ? 

' Then you know what it is to be happy without 
help from any thing but a fostering earth-mother, a be- 
neficent universe, a pure soul and clear conscience. 
This perfect man will know it even better. He will 
have no ambition ; he will eat the fruits of the earth 
thankfully, sleep on her bosom and live at peace with 
every animal. Then, when his heart beats high with 
youth, he will set out to complete his life, led on by 
that vague longing every man feels, when he seeks the 
object of his possible love. Perhaps, some day in his 
wanderings, he will meet a young creature innocent as 



 

himself. Her glances are soft where his are piercing, 
but the shafts from his ardent eyes melt into hers and 
are not quenched, but wake a gentle glow. Their lips 
meet, in the simplicity of their hearts, and he says, 
Fair, soft creature, will you make your home in some 
corner of this great forest, wherever we chance to be ? 
I have been years looking for you. There has been 
in my heart a little ache, though I have not known why, 
and now I see it was because life did me a wrong, in 
half creating me and leaving me to find the other part 
of my nature." 

When his voice ceased, with a beseeching modulation, 
Elizabeth felt her own heart beat quickly. A rapturous 
bluebird, carrying a straw to finish the bridal home, 
chirped from the gate. Oswald went on. 

" Well, she will say c Yes,' or there will be no need 
of saying any thing, because in such a world, there are 
no doubts or denials. They wander wherever they 
choose in the shade of the protecting forest, stop be- 
side some friendly stream until they know its banks 
well enough, and then leave it for still unfamiliar nooks. 
Each day is new ; and when the man and woman, full 
of days, but never acquainted with ache or sorrow, die 
sweetly and happily, as a red, ripe leaf flutters down 
and decays, only to enrich the earth and autumn air, 
their children cover them over with a fold of their 
earth-mother's dress, and above them live happy lives in 
their turn. Elizabeth, is the picture worth painting? " 

"Yes, but it isn't possible," she said, in a voice al- 
most inaudible. Her hands had long ago left their 
task, and her eyes turned seaward. 

" No, think a minute. Couldn't a man and woman, 



so young, remember, that there would be no ghosts 
to haunt them loving each other, make such a home 
and such an ideal life in this land of work and day of 
steam-power ? Are you sure it isn't barely possible ? ' 

' I can't be sure, because I don't know much about 
other people's lives," she answered, in a voice that had 
not relaxed from its tension of excitement. " But life 
is very hard. There are cares for other people, and 
trouble about them, so that it seems to me nobody 
could be perfectly happy, for he would always be 
seeing misery and hearing of it." 

Then you don't understand me. More than that, 
you haven't understood love." He had taken his stand 
near her, and now one of his hands touched hers, trem- 
bling at her side. His eyes, stirred by the momentary 
feeling, sought and held hers. 

' Love blots out the world beyond its border. It 
does not wrong the people standing outside, because it 
never need shirk a duty to them. It simply does not 
need them. They are forgotten, as soon as the eyes of 
the man and woman who love find oblivion in each 
other's depths. Suppose a woman like you loved." 
Elizabeth shivered. So a violin vibrates when the 
strings are touched suddenly, with intent only to wake 
a sound, proving music or discord as it happens. 

' Suppose she loved so that she could say to the man 
who made her destiny, ' Behold me, fine and pure, a gift 
to you from the immortals.' Do you think they, find- 
ing all delight in each other, would or could be made 
unhappy by the grief felt by some man or woman who 
had not reached such blissful heights ? Psyche could 
not die after she had drunk immortality." The sun- 





light was hot above her ; she was helpless under its in- 
tensity and the torrent of his voice. Neither wishing 
to be there, nor able to break the spell, she stood 
swayed by a personal magnetism far stronger than her
