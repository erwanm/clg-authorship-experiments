have had our throats cut besides.”

“But he got us into the scrape,” protested Bill.
“He hired that cut–throat to take us to this place without
saying a word to us about the business. I knew
that fellow was a rascal, and would just as lief cut a
man’s throat as eat his dinner.”

“You knew what he was, did you?”

“To be sure I did. He looked like a villain; and
I would not have trusted myself half a mile from the
shore with him without a revolver in my pocket,”
retorted Bill, who felt safe enough now that he was on
shore.

“I don’t care to hear any more of this,” interposed
the second master. “It must be half–past seven by
this time, and I am going to hurry up to the town. I
looked at an old Bradshaw on board, while I was
making up my plans, and I noticed that the night
trains generally leave at about nine o’clock. There
may be one from this place.”

“But where are you going?” asked Bark.

“It makes no manner of difference to me where I
go, if I only get as far away from Barcelona as possible,”
replied Raimundo. “The police may have
received a despatch, ordering them to arrest us at this
place.”

“Do you believe they have such an order?” asked
Bark, with deep interest.

“I do not believe it; but it may be, for all that. I
am confident no one saw the felucca take us off those
rocks. I feel tolerably safe. But, when Filipe gets
back to Barcelona, he may tell where he took us; and
some one will be on my track in Tarragona as early as
the first train from the north arrives here.”

Raimundo walked towards the town, and Bark still
kept by his side. Bill followed, for he had no intention
of being left alone by his companions. He
thought it was treason on the part of Bark to think of
such a thing as deserting him. He felt that he had
been the leader of the enterprise up to the time he
had got into the boat with the second master; and
that he had conducted Bark out of their prison, and
out of the slavery of the vessel. It would be rank
ingratitude for his fellow–conspirator to turn against
him under such circumstances; and he was surprised
that Bark did not see it in that light. As for the
second master, he did not want any thing more of
him; he did not wish to travel with him, or to have
any thing to do with him. He was an officer of the
Tritonia, one of the tyrants against whom he had
rebelled; and as such he hated him. The consciousness
that he had behaved like a poltroon in the presence
of the officer, while Bark had been a lion in
bravery, did not help the case at all. Raimundo
despised him, and took no pains to conceal his sentiments.

All Bill Stout wanted was to roam over the country
with Bark. In the boat he had imagined the “good
times” they would have when free from restraint.
They could drink and smoke, and visit the places of
amusement in Spain, while the rest of the fellows were
listening to lectures on geography and history, and visiting
old churches. His idea of life and enjoyment was
very low indeed.

After walking for half an hour in the direction of the
nearest lights, they reached the lower part of the town;
and the second master concluded that the railroad
station must be in this section. He inquired in the
street, and found they were quite near it. He was also
told that a train would leave for Alicante and Madrid
at thirty–five minutes past eight. It was only eight
then; and, seeing a store with “A la Barcelona” on
its sign, he knew it was a clothing–store, and the party
entered it. Raimundo bought a long cape coat which
entirely concealed his uniform. Bark and Bill purchased
overcoats, each according to his taste, that
covered up their nautical costume in part, though they
did not hide their seaman’s trousers. At another shop
they obtained caps that replaced their uniform headpieces.

With their appearance thus changed, they repaired to
the station, where Raimundo bought tickets to Valencia.
This is a seaport town, one hundred and sixty–two
miles from Tarragona. Raimundo was going there
because the train went there. His plans for the future
were not definitely arranged; but he did not wish to
dissolve his connection with the academy squadron.
He intended to return to his ship as soon as he could
safely do so, which he believed would be when the vessels
sailed from Lisbon for the “isles of the sea;” but
in this connection he was troubled about the change in
the programme which the principal had introduced
the day before, of which Hugo had informed him. If the
American Prince was to convey the Josephines and the
Tritonias to Lisbon, and bring back the Princes,—for
the several ships’ companies were called by these names,—it
was not probable that the squadron would go to
Lisbon. All hands would then have visited Portugal
and there would be no need of going there again.
Raimundo concluded that the fleet would sail on its
Atlantic voyage from Cadiz, which would save going
three hundred miles to the northward in the middle of
winter.

“Do you want first or second class tickets?” asked
Raimundo, when they stood before the ticket–office.

“A second class is good enough for me,” replied
Bill.

“What class do you take?” asked Bark.
