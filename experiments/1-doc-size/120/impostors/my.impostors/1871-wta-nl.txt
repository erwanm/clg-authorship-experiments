"If we do, Cantwell won't be captain, but he may be a lieutenant; and
that is almost as bad."

"We won't cry till we are hurt, then," said De Forrest; "though I
think something ought to be done to keep us out of such a scrape in
the future. I have a plan in my head, which, I think, would work first
rate, and be a fair thing for all."

"What is it?" asked Beckwith.

"I'll tell you. As the matter now stands, a fellow may jump from the
steerage into the captain's cabin without any experience at all in
commanding, especially, as during the last month, when we are running
about on shore, and we don't do much in seamanship."

"But you know that this struggle for rank puts the fellows on their
good behavior; and the principal would lose his sheet anchor if the
present system were abandoned."

"I don't propose to abandon it entirely. I would like to have the first
five officers made elective."

"You would have the captain and the four lieutenants chosen by ballot?"
asked Beckwith, interested in the plan.

"Precisely so."

"But the fellows in the steerage could have it all their own way under
such a plan. They could make Clyde Blacklock, Sandford, or any such
fellow captain."

"No, you haven't heard me out. The captain and the four lieutenants
shall be chosen from the cabin officers only."

"I rather like that."

"Any fellow will see that it is a fair thing."

"And who would be candidates for masters, pursers, and lieutenants?"
asked Beckwith.

"They must obtain their rank by their merit. By my plan, ten of the
fifteen cabin officers of the ship must get their positions by their
scholarship, conduct, and seamanship, just as they do now; but the
captain or lieutenant must first have served as master, purser, or
midshipman. Then a fellow can't be captain till he has served at least
one month as a cabin officer."

"The plan pleases me; but of course we can't tell how it would work
without a trial."

"It would work first rate. As the matter now stands, no officer has any
inducement to please anybody but the principal and the instructors,
who give him his marks. By my plan he would have to keep on the right
side of his inferiors in rank, or they would throw him over at the next
election."

"And there would be lots of electioneering for office," laughed
Beckwith.

"Well, that would give us a little excitement. Besides, we are all
to be American citizens, and we ought to learn how these things are
done. Under this plan Cantwell wouldn't behave as he does now in the
cabin. He is nothing but a lump of selfishness. He wouldn't take all
the breast of the chicken, or drown his coffee with the last gill of
milk on board. I have been thinking of this thing for a week, and have
talked it over with some of the fellows. All that I have spoken with
like it first rate."

"I do."

"I am going to get up a petition to the principal, asking him to make
this change in the system, and I want to get every fellow's name upon
it."

"I will sign, for one," replied Beckwith. "But you haven't said a word
about the commodore, De Forrest."

"That's only a kind of ornamental office, and I don't care much about
it any way; but I think that only the captains should be eligible to
the position."

Precisely as men do such things on a larger scale, De Forrest,
satisfied that he had added one adherent to the "cause" he was
advocating, passed on to "buzz" another officer on the same subject.
The students connected with the squadron were enjoying a picnic on one
of the uninhabited Aland Islands. It was a lovely spot, for the island
was nearly covered by a beautiful grove of pines, and one slope of it
had a green carpet of verdure. The sixteen boats of the squadron and
of the yachts were moored at the shore, and there was not a ripple on
the sea to disturb them. The ship's band had played all the pieces they
knew; and a great variety of games had been tried, with but indifferent
success. The boys declared that it could be no picnic at all without
the ladies. Possibly the attendance of Mrs. Kendall and Mrs. Shuffles
suggested this idea to them; and, though these ladies were young,
lively, and agreeable, the meagreness of the female representation on
the occasion seemed to be only an aggravation. Doubtless all of them
had attended picnics and other social gatherings, where the gentler
sex is the charm of the occasion, and they could not help feeling
the loneliness of the situation. Besides, the locality itself was
suggestive of utter isolation from the rest of the world.

All around them was a multitude of islands, but not a habitation of
any kind could be seen; not a human being, not a quadruped, not even
a bird enlivened the scene. The water was as calm as the repose of a
mountain lake, with not a single white sail to relieve the gaze of the
beholder. The squadron was anchored behind an island, where it could
not be seen. And the boys knew that they were north of the sixtieth
parallel of latitude,--nearer to the north pole than any of them had
ever been before; and the consciousness of this fact seemed to add to
the lonesomeness of the place. The days were very long and the nights
very short, and it was quite impossible to feel at home in such a
region.

They were not the first to feel in this locality that the great, busy
world was far to the south of them, and to be impressed by the silence
and quiet of the place under such circumstances. A distinguished lady,
in narrating her voyage among these islands, says, "We never lost sight
of the shore, and sometimes were so near it that it seemed as though
