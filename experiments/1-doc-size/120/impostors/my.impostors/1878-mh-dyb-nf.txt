BAKED MUTTON CHOPS.

3 lbs. of mutton chops; 5 fine potatoes; 1 onion; 1 kidney; 1 pint of
oyster-liquor; pepper, salt, and parsley; 1 tablespoonful of butter.

Lay one-third of the chops—rid of all the fat and skin—in a
baking-dish; cover with potatoes and onions, sliced very thin; sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Put on another layer of chops, more potatoes
and onions, then the sliced kidney. Cover with potatoes; season; put
in the rest of the chops; cover with onion and potatoes. Pour in the
oyster-liquor and melted butter, with parsley, pepper, and salt. Cover
very closely, and bake in a moderate oven three hours. Turn out upon a
heated flat dish.


MACARONI PUDDING.

Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces, and boil twenty
minutes in hot, salted water. Drain; add two tablespoonfuls of grated
cheese, the minced remains of yesterday’s game, or some other cold
meat, a little chopped ham, and four beaten eggs. Mix all well, wetting
with a little soup-stock—adding, finally, a cup of milk, in which has
been stirred a pinch of soda. Pour into a greased mould, and boil one
hour. Turn out, and serve with a gravy made of cold gravy left from
yesterday, mixed with a little hot stock, strained, thickened, and
boiled for one minute.


WINTER SQUASH.

Pare, cut up, and cook soft in boiling water, a little salt. Drain;
mash smooth, pressing out all the water; work in butter, pepper, and
salt, and mound in a deep dish.


COLD SLAW.

Shred a firm cabbage, and pour over it a dressing made in these
proportions: One teaspoonful of sugar, half as much salt, pepper, and
made mustard, rubbed smooth in two tablespoonfuls of oil, and then
beaten up very gradually with five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and a
teaspoonful Colgate’s essence of celery.


CRACKER AND JAM PUDDING.

3 eggs; ½ cup cracker-crumbs; ½ cup sugar; i tablespoonful of butter; 1
cup of milk; ½ lemon—juice and grated peel; 3 tablespoonfuls of jam.

Heat milk and crumbs together until scalding. Turn out to cool, while
you rub butter and sugar to a cream—adding the lemon. Stir in the
beaten yolks, the soaked cracker and milk—at last, the whites. Butter
a bake-dish; put the jam at the bottom; fill up with the mixture, and
bake, covered, half an hour; then brown. Eat cold, with sifted sugar on
top. Or, if you like, you can put a méringue over it before taking
from the oven.

“THAT SOUP” AGAIN.

Remove every particle of fat from the top of your stock. Take out what
is needed for to-day, and heat to boiling—slowly.


ROAST TURKEY, GARNISHED WITH SAUSAGES.

Wash out the turkey carefully. Stuff as usual, adding a little cooked
sausage to the dressing. (Salt the giblets, and keep for to-morrow.)
Lay the turkey in the dripping-pan, pour a great cupful of boiling
water over it, and roast about ten minutes per pound—slowly for
the first hour. Baste faithfully and often, dredging with flour, and
basting with butter at the last. Dish the turkey, laying boiled
sausages around it. Pour the fat from the gravy; thicken with browned
flour; salt, and pepper. Boil once, and serve in a boat.


MASHED TURNIPS.

Pare, quarter, and cook tender in boiling water, a little salt. Mash
and press in a heated colander; work in butter, pepper, and salt; heap
smoothly in a deep dish, and put “dabs” of pepper on top.


CANNED CORN PUDDING.

Drain, and chop the corn fine, add a tablespoonful of melted butter,
four beaten eggs; a large cup of milk, with an even teaspoonful of
corn-starch stirred in it, with salt and pepper to taste. Bake,
covered, in a greased pudding-dish one hour; then brown quickly.


SWEET POTATOES.

See Sunday of First Week in December.


CRANBERRY SAUCE.

Cook a quart of cranberries with a very little water, slowly, in a
porcelain or tinned saucepan. Stir often, and when they are broken all
to pieces, and thick as marmalade, take off, sweeten liberally, and rub
through a colander. Wet a mould, and put them in to form.


ORANGE SNOW AND SNOWDRIFT CAKE.

4 large sweet oranges, juice of all, and grated peel of one; juice and
