afraid that I shall get tired or - or homesick." 

" Oh, I mean that you shall go home now and then. 
I don't want to be selfish with you." 

After Kathie had finished her tour of inspection 
she drew the low rocker beside Aunt Euth's bed, and 
took the wasted hand softly in hers. 

" Shall I talk to you ? " she asked, " or will it hurt 
you ? " 

" No, I think not. I am not strong enough to do 
much of it myself" ; and Aunt Euth gave a faint 
smile. " Tell me all about Cedarwood. It seems as 
if I had been away a year." 

Kathie was very entertaining indeed. She told of 
all the pleasant things that had happened, the party 
at Mrs. Gardiner's, and was just coming to their 
collection of autumn leaves when Mrs. Markham 
entered. She was a pale, high-bred looking woman 
past fifty, but so sweet that Kathie was won at once. 

"Why, you are actually looking improved," she 
said to Aunt Euth. " Are you sure that you have 
not talked yourself into a fever ? ' 



 

"I have been listening principally." 

She laid her hand softly on Aunt Euth's brow, and 
found it moist and tranquil. 

" It has been rather lonesome for her/' said Mrs. 
Markham. " It is not quite as if she were too ill to 
see any one, and after a month or so the bed begins 
to grow wearisome. But she has been very patient." 

After getting a little acquainted with Kathie she 
took her down stairs for supper. The nurse was to 
bring Aunt Euth's, and then she was to be left quiet 
for an hour or two. 

Kathie felt rather afraid of Dr. Markham at first. 
He had a habit of giving sudden sharp looks that 
almost startled her, and he asked odd, abrupt ques- 
tions ; but before they had risen from the table Mr. 
Meredith came in, and presently Uncle Robert joined 
them. Mr. Meredith teased her a little about play- 
ing nurse, and declared that he meant to get sick the 
first time he came to Cedarwood. 

Kathie found the next day that her duties would 
not be very arduous. She dusted the room, and after 
Aunt Ruth was taken up^ combed her soft hair in the 
gentlest manner. Then she read to liar a little, and 
waited upon her whenever she wacted anything. In 





the afternoon Uncle Robert came to take her out, and 
explained to her about the music lessons. A Mrs. 
Gifford was to give them twice a week, and every 
day Kathie was to go and practise two hours if she 
could. 

"And that will be sufficient for you to have on 
your mind," said Uncle Eobert. " It will give you a 
good walk and make a pleasant change. 

They went to see Mrs. Gifford, a little roly-poly 
woman with a face full of smiles and dimples, and a 
soft, rich voice that was music itself. 

" I am sure I shall like it," said Kathie, delight- 
edly. " Why, I don't believe that I shall feel a bit 
homesick." 

Afterward they called on Ada Meredith. They 
were ushered into an elegant parlor, and the little 
lady came to receive them, in her most gracious 
manner. Kathie had a feeling of astonishment, and 
she was not quite sure that she liked so much 
grandeur. The children were out with their nurse, 
but Kathie could not forget them, and left fond 
messages for them all. 



 



CHAPTEE VIII. 

PLAYING NURSE. 

AFTER seeing Kathie nicely domesticated at Dr. 
Markham's, Uncle Eobert returned home. The boys 
had bemoaned him sadly, Fred especially, who made 
daily lamentations concerning his locomotive, which 
he was quite sure had strayed into pound in spite of 
his carefulness. 

Aunt Kuth was certainly improving. I think part 
of it was due to Kathie's cheerful presence and the 
charming way in which she anticipated every want. 
Mrs. Markham declared that she was a treasure, and 
the doctor petted her in numerous quiet ways, now 
and then indulging her in a drive. She did possess 
a very sweet and happy nature ; but it was not that 
alone. She was trying to grow a little better every 
day. She had temptations like all other children, 
and she did not always feel patient and self-denying ;
