glades of La Bellissima could have awakened in 
him a passion so sudden and final. Her face between the black folds turned whiter and she 
shrank back against the jagged wall; and when 
his eyes flashed again with a wild eager hope she 
involuntarily crossed herself. He threw himself 
against the horse and snatched her down and 
kissed her as he had kissed no woman yet, recognizing her once for all. 

When he finally held her at arm's length for a 
moment he laughed confusedly. 

" The Eussian bear is no longer a figure of 
speech,' he said. " Forgive me. I forgot that 
you are as tender as you are strong.'' 

Her hands were tightly clasped against her 
breast, and the breath was short in her throat, 
but she made no protest. Her eyes were radiant, 
her mouth was the only color in that gray dawn. 
In a moment she too laughed. 

" Dios de mi alma! What will they say? A 
heretic! If Tamalpais fell into the sea it would 
not make so great a sensation in this California 
of ours where civilized man exists but to drive 
heathen souls into the one true church." 

" Will it matter to you! Are you strong 
enough? It will be only a question of time to win 
them over, if you are." 



 

She nodded emphatically. " I was born with 
strength. Now — Dios! — now I can be stronger 
than the King of Spain himself, than the Governor, my parents and all the priests — You would 
not become a Catholic! " she asked abruptly. 

He shook his head, although he still smiled at 
her. " Not even for you. ' ' 

" No," she said thoughtfully. " I will confess 
— what matters it! — I often dreamed that this 
would come just because I believed it would not. 
But why should one control the imagination when 
it alone can give us happiness for a little while! 
I gave it reign, for I thought that one-half of all 
my life was to be passed in that unreal but by no 
means niggardly world. And I thought of everything. To change your religion would mean the 
ruin of your career; moreover, it is not a possibility of your character. Were it I think I 
should not love you so much. Nor could I 
bear to think of any change in you. Only it will 
be harder — longer.'' Then she stretched out her 
hand, and closed and opened it slowly. The most 
obtuse could not have failed to read the old simile 
of the steel in the velvet. " I shall win because 
it is my nature — and my power— to hold what I 
grasp. ' ' 



 

" But if tliey persistently refuse- 



" Dios ! " she interrupted him. " Do you think 
that your love is greater than mine? I was born 
with a thousand years of love in me and had 
you not come I should have gone alone with my 
dreams to the grave. I am all women in one, 
not merely Concha Argiiello, a girl of sixteen." 
She clasped her hands high above her head, lifting her eyes to the ashen vault so soon to yield 
to the gay brush of dawn. 

" Before all that great mystery, " she said 
solemnly, " I give myself to you forever, how 
much or how little that may mean here on earth. 
Forever.''

The Comandante of the San Francisco Company sat opposite Kezanov with his mouth open, 
the lines of his strong face elongated and relaxed. 
It was the hour of siesta, and they were alone in 
the sala. 

" Mother of God! " he exclaimed. " Mother 
of God! Are you mad, Excellency? " 

" No man was ever saner, " said Rezanov cheerfully. " What better proof would you have than 
this final testimony to Doha Concha's perfections? '' 

" But it cannot be! Surely, Excellency, you 
realize that ! The priests ! Ay yi ! Ay yi ! ' ' 

" I think I understand the priests. Persuade 
the Governor to buy my cargo and they will look 
upon me as an amicus humasii generis to whom 
common rules do not apply. And I have won 
their sincere friendship.'' 

'' You have won mine, sehor. But, though I 
say it, there is no more devout Catholic in the 
Californias than Jose Argiiello. Do you know 
what they call me? El santo. God knows I am 




not, but it is not for want of the wish. Did I 
give my daughter to a heretic, not only should I 
become an outcast, a pariah, but I should imperil 
my everlasting soul and that of my best beloved
