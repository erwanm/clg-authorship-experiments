The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their 
circumference, like a gasometer. If you should fill a gasometer 
half way up with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide 
and deep well down through the center of this mass of masonry, 
you would have the idea of a Tower of Silence. On the 
masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in shallow trenches 

which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well. The trenches 
slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall. Under- 
ground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this 
water from the bottom of the well. 

When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain 
and the flaming sun a month it is perfectly dry and clean. 
Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved and 
take it up with tongs and throw it into the well. There it 
turns to dust. It is never seen again, never touched again, in 
the world. Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve 
and continue social distinctions in the grave — the skeletons of 
kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons 
proper to skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons of the 
commonplace and the poor in places suited to their meaner 
estate ; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death 
— all are humble, all poor, all destitute. In sign of their 
poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their 
equality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the 
obscure are flung into the common well together. At a Parsee 
funeral there are no vehicles ; all concerned must walk, both 
rich and poor, howsoever great the distance to be traversed 
may be. In the wells of the Five Towers of Silence is mingled 
the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who 
have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries 
which have elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove 
the Parsees out of Persia, and into that region of India. The 
earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family some- 
thing more than 200 years ago, and it is now reserved to the 
heirs of that house; none but the dead of that blood are 
carried thither. 

The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral 
is not now known — the presence of the dog. Before a corpse 
is borne from the house of mourning it must be uncovered and 
exposed to the gaze of a dog ; a dog must also be led in the 
rear of the funeral. Mr. Nusservvanjee Byramjee, Secretary to 
the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had once had 
a meaning and a reason for their institution, but that they 
were survivals whose origin none could now account for. 
Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows 
them. It is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog 
was a sacrecl animal and could guide souls to heaven ; also that 
his eye had the power of purifying objects which had been 
contaminated by the touch of the dead ; and that hence his 
presence with the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable 
remedy in case of need. 

The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the 
dead is an effective protection of the living ; that it dissemin- 
ates no corruption, no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs ; 
that no wrap, no garment which has touched the dead is 
allowed to touch the living, afterward; that from the Towers 
of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the out- 
side world. These are just claims, I think. As a sanitary 
measure, their system seems to be about the equivalent of 
cremation, and as sure. We are drifting slowly — but hope- 
fully — toward cremation in these days. It could not be ex- 
pected that this progress should be swift, but if it be steady 
and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice. When cre- 
mation becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it ; we 
should shudder at burial if we allowed ourselves to think what 
goes on in the grave. 

The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he 
did a mystery whose key is lost. He was humble, and appar- 
ently depressed"; and he let his head droop pensively, and 
looked as if he might be trying to call back to his mind what 
it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when he began 
his function. There was another impressive thing close at 
hand, but I was not privileged to see it. That was the sacred 
fire — a fire which is supposed to have been burning without 
interruption for more than two centuries; and so, living by 
the same heat that was imparted to it so long ago. 

The Parsees are a remarkable community. There are only 
about 60,000 in Bombay, and only about half as many as that 
in the rest of India ; but they make up in importance what 
they lack in numbers. They are highly educated, energetic, 

enterprising, progressive, rich, and 
the Jew himself is not more lavish 
or catholic in his charities and 
benevolences. The Parsees build 
and endow hospitals, for both men 
and animals ; and they and their 
womenkind keep an open purse for 
all great and good objects. They 
are a political force, and a valued 
support to the government. They 
have a pure and lofty religion, and 
they preserve it in its integrity and 
order their lives by it. 

We took a final sweep of the 
wonderful view of plain and city 
and ocean, and so ended our visit to the garden and the 
Towers of Silence ; and the last thing I noticed was another 
symbol — a voluntary symbo this one; it was a vulture 
standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and branch- 
less palm in an open space in the ground ; he was perfectly 
motionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar. 
And he had a mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with 
the place. 




A PARSEE.
