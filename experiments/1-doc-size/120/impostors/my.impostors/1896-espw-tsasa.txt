human faces at which the very angels and virtues 
in the painted windows seemed to turn their heads 
and stare. 

Such wretchedness, such pallor, hunger, cold, 
envy, sickness, sin, and shame were as unknown to 
those dedicated and decorated walls as the inmates 
of hell. Rags and disease, uncleanliness and woe 
and want, trod the house of God as if they had the 
right there. Every pew in the church was thrown 
open. Tattered blanket shawls jostled velvet cloaks, 
and worn little tan-colored reefers, half concealing 
the shivering cotton blouses of last summer, rubbed 
against sealskin furs that swept from throat to foot. 
Wretched men, called in by the throb of repentance 
that follows a debauch, lifted their haggard eyes to 
the chancel from the pews of the wardens, and 
women of the town sat gently beside the " first 
ladies " of the parish and of the city. There were 
a few ragged children in the audience, wan and 
shrewd, sitting drearily beside mothers to whom 
they did not cling. The pew of our friend, the 
vestryman, was filled to overflowing. The wife 
with the under lip sat beside him, and did not
protest. She had herself gone with him to the hospital 



to select their guests. For their pew was filled with 
the crippled and other sick who could neither walk 
nor afford to ride, and whom their own carriage had 
brought to Saint Agatha s. One of these, a woman, 
came on crutches, and the lady helped her, not 
knowing in the least how to do it ; and a man who 
had not used his feet for six years was lifted in by 
the pew-owner and his coachman and butler, and 
carried the length of the broad aisle. 

The church, as we say, was packed long before 
the preacher appeared. He came punctually to his 
appointment, like any ordinary man. It was mid- 
afternoon, and the sun was declining when he 
glided across the chancel. Already shadows were 
lying heavily in the corners of the church and under 
the galleries on the darker side. A few lights were 
glimmering about the chancel, but these served only 
to illuminate the stranger's form and face ; they did 
not lighten the mass of hushed and appealing hu 
manity before him. 

The choir, with bowed heads, just above the 
breath, began to chant : 

Who shall lay anything to the charge 

Of God's Elect ? 

It is God that justifieth, 

It is Christ that died. 




While they sang the preacher stood quite still and 
looked at the people, that strange and motley mass, 
the rich and the poor, the sick and the well, the 
disgraced and the reputable, the pampered and the 
starving, the shameful and the clean of life, the 
happy and the wretched together. When the sing, 
ing ceased, he spoke as if he talked right on ; he 
read no prayers ; he turned to no ritual ; he did not 
even use the great Bible of Saint Agatha's but 
only spoke in a quiet way, like a man who continues 
a thought begun : 

" For the Lord," he said, " is the maker of you 
all." 

There was no sermon in Saint Agatha's that after 
noon. Ecclesiastically speaking, there was no 
service. But the preacher spoke to the people; and 
their hearts hung upon his words. But what those 
words were no man may tell us at this day. 

It has been whispered, indeed, that what he said 
took different meanings to the members of that 
strange audience. Each heart received its own 
message. Wide as the earth were the gulfs between 
those hearers. But the preacher's message bridged 
them all. From his quivering lip and melting voice 
each soul drank the water of life. Afterwards each 



 

kept its own secret, and told not of that thirst, or 
of its assuaging. 

"He speaks to me/ sighed the patrician, with 
bowed head. "How happens this, for I thought 
no man did know that inner history ? I have never 
told" 

" To me ! To me ! " sohbed the pauper and the 
castaway " the preacher speaks to me. My misery, 
my shame the whole world knows, but no man 
ever understood before." 

The afternoon waned. The shadows deepened 
under the galleries. The great house clung like 
one child to the voice of the preacher. It was as 
still as the courts of Heaven when a soul is 
pardoned. The stranger spoke in a low but penetrat 
ing voice. Not a word was lost by the remotest. 
He spoke of the love of God the Father, and of the 
life of Christ the Son. He spoke of sin and of for 
giveness, of sorrow, of shame, and of peace. He 
spoke of sacrifice, of patience, of purity, and of
