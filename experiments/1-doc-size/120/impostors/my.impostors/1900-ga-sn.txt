 

When she went up to her room, she presented the 
black gown to Le"ontine and sent her to bed. Then 
she put on a peignoir of pink silk and lace and examined herself in the mirror. She looked fifteen years 
younger and wholly charming; there was no doubt 
of it.

THE next day, before starting for New York, she 
wrote a note to Senator North : 

I am going to marry Robert Burleigh. On Tuesday 
morning I almost went to your house to bring you back 
with me here. I came to my senses in time ; but I might 
not again. I want you to understand. 

I wish he were not on the winning side. But he is the 
only man I can even think of marrying. 

I do not think this much is disloyal to him. But I will 
not say other things. B. M. 

Burleigh came to the train to see her off, and Betty 
looked so charming in her rich brown travelling frock 
and little turban, and smiled so gayly upon him, that 
his heavy spirit lifted its wings and he begged to be allowed to go to New York on Saturday. But to this she 
would not listen, and he was forced to content himself 
with making elaborate preparations for her comfort in 
the little drawing-room, and buying a copy of every 
paper and magazine the newsboy had on sale. 

" I am sure he will make an ideal husband," said 
Mrs. Madison, as she waved her hand to him from the 
window. 



 

" He certainly is very much of a man," admitted 
Betty, " but what on earth are we to do with all these 
papers? I haven't.room to turn round." 

The excitement in Washington, great as it was, had 
been mostly within doors ; in New York it appeared 
to be entirely in the streets, if one excepted the corridors of the hotels. The population, still pale and 
nervously talkative, surged up and down the sidewalks. 
On the morrow the city put forth her hundred thousand flags. The very air seemed to turn to stars and 
stripes. 

The Madisons went to the Waldorf-Astoria, and in 
its refreshing solitudes felt for the first time in months 
that they must go in search of excitement if they 
wanted it ; none would reach them here. 

"Now that the war is declared, I am sorry," admitted Mrs. Madison, " for so many Americans will 
be killed." 

" Instead of Cubans. I 've done with the war. I 
won't even regret." 

For three days Betty shopped furiously, or held long 
consultations with her dressmaker. On Sunday, after 
church, she read to her mother, but refused to discuss 
her engagement, and on Monday she resumed her 
shopping. She wrote to Burleigh immediately after 
breakfast every morning, then dismissed him from her 
mind for twenty-four hours. 

The beautiful spring fabrics were in the shops, and 
she bought so many things she did not want, even for 
a trousseau, that she wondered if Mrs. Mudd would 
accept a trunk full of" things." She envied Mrs. Mudd, 
and would find a contradictory pleasure in making her 
happy. Miss Trumbull never had manifested any false 



 

pride, and matrimony had altered her little in other 
ways. 

At night she slept very well, and if she did not think 
of Burleigh, neither would she think of Senator North. 

She did not open a newspaper. What the country 
did now had no interest for her ; it was marching to 
its drums, and nothing could stop it. And she would 
have her fill of politics for the rest of her natural 
life. As Mrs. Madison always was content with a 
novel, she made no complaint at the absence of news- 
papers, particularly as the fighting had not begun. 
Moreover, Betty took her to the theatre every evening, 
a dissipation which her invalidism endured without a 
protest. 

It was on Wednesday afternoon that Betty, returning 
to her rooms, met Sally Carter in a corridor of the 
hotel. The two girls kissed as if no war had come 
between them, and Miss Carter announced that she 
was going to Cuba to nurse the American soldier. 

" I almost feel conscience-stricken," she remarked, 
" now that we actually are in for it. I don't think I 
believed it ever really could happen. It was more 
like a great drama that was about to take place somewhere on the horizon. But if the American boys 
have to be shot, I 'm going to be there to do what I 
can." 

They entered the parlor of Mrs. Madison's suite, and 
that good lady, who had read until her eyes ached, 
welcomed Sally with effusion and demanded news of 
Washington.
