 

and the pages scampered down the gangways and 
carried back documents to the clerk below the Vice- 
President's chair, while their senders made a few remarks meaningless to Betty. Two or three delivered 
brief speeches which were equally unintelligible to one 
not acquainted with current legislation. During one 
of them a man of imposing appearance entered and was 
apparently congratulated by almost every one in the 
room, the Senators leaving their seats and coming to 
the middle aisle, where he stood, to shake him by the 
hand. Betty felt sorry for Le"ontine, who was on the 
verge of tears, but determined to .remain until Senator 
North appeared if she did not leave until it should be 
time to dress for dinner. 

He entered finally and went straight to his desk. 
He looked preoccupied, and began writing at once. 
In a few moments the clerk commenced to read 
from a document, and Senator North laid aside his 
pen and listened attentively. So did several other 
Senators. It was a very long document, and Betty, 
who could not understand one word in ten as delivered 
by the clerk's rumbling monotonous voice, was desperately bored, and was glad her Senators had the 
solace of the cloak-rooms. Several did in fact retire 
to them, but when the clerk sat down and Senator 
North rose, they returned ; and Betty felt a personal 
pride in the fact that they were about to listen to the 
Senator whom herself had elected to honor. 

She had to lean forward and strain her ears to hear 
him. It was evident that he did not recognize the 
existence of the gallery, for he did not raise his voice 
from beginning to end ; and yet it was of that strong 
rich quality that might have carried far. But it 



 

neither " rang out like a clarion," nor " thundered imprecation." Neither did he utter an impassioned 
phrase nor waste a word, but he denounced the bill 
as a party measure, exposed its weak points, riddled 
it with sarcasm, and piled up damaging evidence of 
partisan zeal. " This is an honorable body," he concluded, " and few measures go out of it that are open 
to serious criticism by the self-constituted guardians of 
legislative virtue, but if this bill goes through the 
Senate we shall invite from the thinking people of the 
country the same sort of criticism which we now 
receive from the ignorant. If the high standard of 
this body is to be maintained, it must be by sound and 
conservative legislation, not by grovelling to future 
legislatures." 

Having administered this final slap, he sat down and 
began writing again, apparently paying no attention 
to the Chairman of the bill, who defended his measure 
with eloquence and vigor. It was a good speech, but 
it contained more words than the one that had provoked it and fewer points. Senator North replied 
briefly that the only chance for the bill was for its 
father to refrain from calling attention to its weak 
points, then went into the Republican cloak-room, 
presumably to smoke a cigar. Betty, whose head 
ached, went home. 



VII 

THAT evening, as Betty was rummaging through a cup- 
board in the library looking for a seal, she came upon 
a box of Cuban cigars. They could have been her 



 

father's only and of his special importation : he had 
smoked the choicest tobacco that Havana had been 
able to furnish. 

She knew that many men would prize that box of 
cigars, carefully packed in lead and ripened by time, 
and she suddenly determined to send it to Senator 
North. She felt that it would be an acute pleasure 
to give him something, and as for the cigars they were 
too good for any one else. She took the box to her 
room and wrapped it up carefully and badly; but 
when she came to the note which must accompany it, 
she paused before the difficulties which mechanically 
presented themselves. Senator North might naturally 
feel surprise to receive a present from a young woman 
with whom he had talked exactly six minutes. If she 
wrote playfully, offering a small tribute at the shrine of 
statesmanship, he might wonder if she worked slippers 
for handsome young clergymen and burned candles 
before the photograph of a popular tenor. She might 
send them anonymously, but that would not give her 
the least satisfaction. Finally, she reluctantly decided 
to wait until she met him again and could lead the 
conversation up to cigars. " Perhaps he will see me 
in the gallery to-morrow," she thought. 

But although he sat in his comfortable revolving- 
chair for two hours the next afternoon, he never lifted 
his eyes to the gallery. She heard several brief and 
excellent speeches, but went home dissatisfied. On 
the day after her return from New York, whither she 
went to perform the duty of bridesmaid, she had a 
similar experience, twice varied. Senator Burleigh 
made a short speech in a voice that was truly magnificent, and following up Senator North's attack 



 

on the bill unpopular on the Republican side of the 
Chamber. He was answered by " Blunderbuss " Pepper, the new Senator who had turned every aristocrat out of office in his aristocratic Southern State 
and filled the vacancies with men of his own humble origin. He was a burly untidy-looking man, and 
frequently as uncouth in speech, a demagogue and
