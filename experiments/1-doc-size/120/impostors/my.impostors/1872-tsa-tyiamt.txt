with as much pleasure in his voice as if a favor had 
been done to himself. 

I met him two or three times afterward on my 
visits to the sick journeyman, and was more and more 
impressed with the simple beauty of his character 



 

and the unselfishness of his devotion to the poor and 
suffering. 

" This is thankless work for you, sir," I remem 
ber having said to him at one of our meetings, and 
I didn 't soon forget his reply, nor the look and tone 
with which it was given. My first thought when he 
began to speak was of cant. But it did not linger 
an instant in my mind. I felt that he was sincere. 

" If I looked for thanks or gain, my friend, I would 
look somewhere else. I am only God 's servant, 
trying to do his will. He went about doing good 
while upon earth, and I am trying humbly to walk 
in his footsteps. That is all, my friend. And I have 
my reward." 

A faint smile, but very sweet and tender, broke into 
his wasted face. 

" But, oh dear !" he added, and a shadow of pain 
swept across his countenance. " If men would not 
give themselves to this dreadful work of destroying 
souls and bodies just for gain ! It is drink, drink, 
drink, that makes nearly all of this suffering and 
poverty and crime that I have to meet and minister 
to, help and hinder, every day. It is drink that has 
impoverished this poor workman 's family and made 
the father 's death almost certain. It is drink that is 
cursing the poor. A deep and bitter cry has gone 
up, and still goes up, but the cry is yet in vain. 
God help the poor women and children, for there 
seems to be none in man !" 

He was strongly agitated now. The great con 



 

cern he evidently felt for the poor and wretched 
among whom he labored seemed to shake his very 
soul. The beaded sweat stood on his pale, pure fore 
head, and for a little while he trembled. 

But he grew calm in a few moments, saying, 

" We must work and be patient, my friend. God 
has his own good time, and he will bring it to pass. 
I have seen the wicked in great power, and spread 
ing himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed 
away, and, lo, he was not. I sought him, but he 
could not be found. God is good and wise and 
strong, and his judgment sure. He will recom 
pense evil." 

I saw him again, after our fellow-workman died, 
trying as best he could to comfort the stricken ones 
who had been left in utter destitution, and once again 
when he came to the bindery to solicit help for the 
widow and orphans. And this was the man whose 
only son we were corrupting and depraving ! 

Very fast the evil work went on. Before the year 
was out, Ned Allen had fallen far away from the 
pure life he had known at the beginning. At first 
he had very little money, and oftener drank his glass 
of beer at another 's expense. John Ashley and he 
were very thick, and the former nearly always stood 
treat when they came to the bar together. But after 
a few months Ned had more pocket-money, and 
spent, to my knowledge, in drinking, theatre-going 
and in other ways, not less than three or four dollars 
a week. I wondered to myself sometimes where it 



 

all came from, but then it was none of my business, 
and I didn 't trouble my head about it. 

We kept open on Sundays, of course ; these were 
among our best days. There was a law against sell 
ing liquor on that day, but it was as much a dead 
letter as the law against selling to minors, or to 
persons known as common drunkards. There must 
be proof of the selling and drinking, and, as things 
were, this was not so easily done as might be 
thought. At any rate, there were from five to seven 
thousand places for selling liquor open every Sun 
day, and no one was called to account. The law lay 
dead upon the statute-book. 

Among our Sunday visitors we were pretty sure 
to have some of the boys. Ned got to coming 
in about church-time and staying until service was 
over, when he would go home, and pretend that he 
had been to church. 

The first time he came, one of our regular Sunday 
drinkers, who knew him and his father 's calling, said, 
half in surprise and half in reproof, 

" What brings you here, Ned Allen ? " 

" Came to Sunday-school," answered the boy, 
promptly, giving his questioner a knowing wink.
