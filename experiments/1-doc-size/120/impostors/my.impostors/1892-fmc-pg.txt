glad, for he knew that the world she despised would give her little
credit for her generous act. Yet, in spite of his self-contempt, he was
happy. Five minutes before one o'clock on the next day he rang at her
door. She had returned as usual to the small apartment she had occupied
since leaving the Tempietto.

He found her dressed for walking, all in black, and looking at the
clock. As he entered she turned and laughed happily. There was a faint
colour in her cheeks too.

"I knew you would not let me ruin my reputation for the sake of your
obstinacy," she said, as she came forward to meet him. "In four minutes
I would have left the house." She grasped his hand warmly as she spoke.

"No," he said, "I could not have done that. What ways you have of
forcing people to obey you! But you are very wrong; I still maintain
that."

"Sit down," she said, "and let us talk of more interesting things. I
must hear the whole story from your own lips, though I am sure my mother
did her best to be quite truthful; but she does not understand you and
never will, as I begin to think."

"Tell me first how you are, and about Herbert," said Ghisleri. "You will
hear quite enough of this miserable affair. It will keep a day or two."

"It need not keep so long as that," answered Laura, "I can tell you the
news in a few words. I am perfectly well. Herbert is perfectly well too,
thank God, and has outgrown his clothes twice and his shoes four times
since we have been away. Since I last wrote great things have happened.
I have been in England again at last, and have stayed with the
Lulworths. You see I am in mourning. Uncle Herbert died a month ago. I
never saw the old gentleman but once, for he lived in the most
extraordinary way, in complete isolation. You know that--well, he is
dead, and he has left all the fortune to my Herbert, with a life
interest in one-quarter of it for me, besides an enormous allowance for
Herbert's education. That is all there is to tell."

"It is good news indeed," said Ghisleri. "I am so glad. It will make an
immense difference to you, though of course you have known of it a long
time."

"It will not make so much difference as you fancy. I shall go on living
much as I do, for I have had almost all I wanted in these years. But I
am glad for Herbert's sake, of course. And now begin, please, and do not
stop until you have told me everything."

"Needs must, when you will anything," Ghisleri answered, with a faint
smile.

So he told her the story, while she listened and watched him. She had
developed in strength and decision during the last year, more rapidly
than before, and he felt in speaking to her as though she had power to
help him and would use it. He was grateful, and more than grateful.
Within the last few weeks he had learned that the strongest and most
determined men may sometimes need a friend. He had long had one in her,
and he had found a new one in San Giacinto; but though the latter's
imposing personality had more influence in the world than that of any
man Ghisleri knew, there was that in Laura's sympathy which gave him a
new strength of his own, and fresh courage to face the many troubles he
expected to encounter before long. For man gets no such strength in life
to do great deeds or to bear torments sudden and sharp or mean, little
and harassing, as he gets from the woman he loves, even though he does
not yet know that she loves him again.

"I hope I do not take my own side too much," he said, as he ended the
long tale, "though I suppose that when a man is perfectly innocent he
has a right to say hard things of people who accuse him. For my own
part, I believe that Donna Adele is mad. There is the ingenuity of
madness in everything she does in this affair. No sane person could
invent such a story almost out of nothing, and make half the world
believe it."

"She may be mad," Laura answered, "but she is bad, too. It will all come
out at the trial, and she will get what she deserves."

"I hope so. But do you know what I really expect? Unless it can be
proved that the confession has been all the time in the safe keeping of
some person who has not even read it, I shall be convicted and
imprisoned. I am quite prepared for that. I suppose that will come to me
by way of expiation for my sins."

"Please do not talk like that," cried Laura. "It is absurd! There is no
court in the world that would convict you--a perfectly innocent man.
Besides I shall give my evidence about those letters. I shall insist
upon it. That alone would be enough to clear you."

"I am afraid not. Even my lawyer thinks that your testimony would not
help me much. After all, you know what happened. I told you that I was
innocent, and you believed me. Or, if you please, you believed me
innocent before I said I was. There is only your belief or my word to
fall back upon, and neither would prove anything in court. Ubaldini says
so. I really expect to be convicted, and I will bear it as well as I
can. I will certainly not do anything to escape from it all." He had
hesitated as he reached the last words, but he saw that Laura
understood.

"You should not even think of such things," she said gravely. "You are
far too brave a man to take your own life even if you were convicted,
and you shall not be. I tell you that you shall not be!" she repeated,
with sudden energy.

"No one can tell. But I am inclined to think that if you were angry you
might terrify judge and jury into doing whatever you pleased." He
laughed a little. "You have grown so strong of late that I hardly
recognise you. What has made the change?"

"Something--I cannot explain it to you. Besides--was I ever a weak
woman? Did I ever hesitate much?"

"No, that is true. Perhaps I did not use the right word. You seem more
active, more alive, more determined to influence other people."

"Do I? It may be true. I fancy I am less saint-like in your opinion than
I was. I am glad of it. You used to think me quite different from what I
was. But I know that I have changed during this summer. I feel it now."

"So have I. The change began before you went away." Ghisleri glanced at
her, and then looked at the wall.
