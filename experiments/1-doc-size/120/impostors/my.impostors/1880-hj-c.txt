" If you want really to know, then — can't you see 
that your remorse seemed to me connected in a certain 
way with your affection ; a sort of guarantee of it ? 
You thought you had injured some one or other, and 
that seemed to be mixed up with your loving me, and 
therefore I let it alone." 

" Ah," said Bernard, " my remorse is all gone, and 
yet I think I love you about as much as ever ! So 
you see how wrong you were not to tell me." 

" The wrong to you I don't care about. It is very 
true I might have told you for Mr. Wright's sake. 
It would perhaps have made him look better. But 
as you never attacked him for deserting me, it seemed 
needless for me to defend him.'' 

" I confess," said Bernard, " I am quite at sea 
about Gordon's look in the matter. Is he looking 
better now — or is he looking worse ? You put it 
very well just now ; I was attending to you, thoiigh 
you said I was not. If he hoped you would refuse 
him, with whom is his quarrel at present ? And why 
was he so cool to me for months after we parted at 
Baden ? If that was his state of mind, why should 
he accuse me of inconsistency ? " 







" There is something in it, after all, that a woman 
can understand. I don't know whether a man can. 
He hoped I would refuse him, and yet when I had 
done so he was vexed. After a while his vexation 
subsided, and he married poor Blanche; hut, on 
learning to-day that I had accepted you, it flickered 
up again. I suppose that was natural enough ; but it 
won't be serious." 

" What will not be serious, my dear?" asked Mrs. 
Vivian, who had come back to the drawing-room, and 
who, apparently, could not hear that the attribute in 
question was wanting in any direction, without some 
alarm. 

" Shall I tell mamma, Bernard ? " said Angela. 

" Ah, my dear child, I hope it 's nothing tliat 
threatens your mutual happiness," mamma murmured, 
with gentle earnestness. 

" Does it threaten our mutual happiness, Bernard ? " 
the girl went on, smiling. 

" Let Mrs. Vivian decide whether we ought to let 
it make us miserable," said Bernard. "Dear Mrs. 
Vivian, you are a casuist, and this is a nice case." 

" Is it anything about poor Mr. Wright ? " the elder 
lady inquired. 

"Why do you say 'poor' Mr. Wright?" asked 
Bernard. 

" Because I am sadly afraid he is not Tiappy with 
Blanche." 



" Hdw did you discover that — without seeing 
them together ? " 

" Well, perhaps you will think me very fanciful," 
said Mrs. Vivian ; " but it was by the way he looked 
at Angela. He has such an expressive face." 

" He looked at me very kindly, mamma," Angela 
observed. 

" He regularly stared, my daughter. In any one else 
I should have said it was rude. But his situation is 
so peculiar ; and one could see that he admired you 
still." And Mrs. Vivian gave a little soft sigh. 

" Ah ! she is thinking of the thirty thousand a 
year," Bernard said to himself. 

" I am sure I hope he admires me still," the girl 
cried, laughing. " There is no great harm in that." 

'' He was comparing you with Blanche — and he was 
struck with the contrast." 

" It couldn 't have been in my favor. If it 's a 
question of being looked at, Blanche bears it better 
than I." 

" Poor little Blanche ! " murmured Mrs. Vivian, 
sweetly. 

" Why did you tell me he was so happy with her ? " 
Angela asked, turning to Bernard, abruptly. 

Bernard gazed at her a moment, with his eyebrows 
raised. 

" I never saw any one ask such sudden questions ! " 
he exclaimed. 





" You can answer me at your leisure," she rejoined, 
turning away. 

" It was because I adored you."
