are pitiably muddled about the whole Chris- 
tian idea. The religion of Jesus has devas- 
tated itself with practical blunders enough to 
have destroyed a less robust faith or one of 
lower origin. We may paraphrase the cele- 
brated cry of Madame Roland : " Oh Chris- 
tianity ! Christianity ! How many crimes are 
committed in thy name ! " The central figure 
of human history, the Galilean has founded a 
faith upon which he distinctly urges that the 
survival of the soul depends. Yet, after two 
thousand years of Christian culture, our practi- 
cal results are not unlike the Russian peasant's 
view of the Trinity — " The Saviour, Mother 
of God, and St. Nicholas." Considered as the 
disciples of a religion representing the awful 
claim of Christianity, we are surprisingly dis- 
integrated by those vagaries and weaknesses 
which defeat unity and organization. We are 
corroded by worldliness of heart. We are im- 



 

prisoned in narrowness of intellect. We are 
disgraced by a defective humanity. 

The essential principles of Jesus Christ 
seem to be reduced to three. The first of 
these is the imperious demand for a personal 
consecration to right, so select, so severe, so 
lofty, and so sustained that it is to be com- 
prehended only through achievement. Far 
beyond our brightest fact we see it shining in 
a dazzling mist, as one sees the outline of the 
Celestial City in that old engraving setting 
forth the course of Bunyan's Pilgrim — the 
one supreme ideal of the earth. Who was 
Christ ? A carpenter become a rabbi — what 
we should call a " self - made " itinerant 
preacher. What has he done? Guided the 
conscience and created the hope of the w r orld. 
How did he do it ? By personal holiness noth- 
ing less than awful. To study this highly- 
sensitized nature even as an intellectual ex- 
ercise, for an hour, is to breathe rarefied air. 
We descend from it, panting, as one does from 
a great poem or a mountain. What would be 
the effect of a thorough moral assimilation of 
this delicate atmosphere ? What refinement of 





the sensibility ! What nutrition of the soul ! 
What sacred fire to the brain ! What spiritual 
courtliness to the conduct ! 

What do Christian believers undertake ? 
Simply the imitation of the most intense life 
the world has known. An acute absorption 
in the process would seem to be logically nec- 
essary. Most of us go about it as we go to a 
matinee where the programme is too familiar. 
What does the Founder of our religion de- 
mand ? Absolutely, the surrender of personal 
preference to his theory of life. Yet the last 
thing which we seem likely to do is to agree 
upon his theory. Whatever else it is not, it 
is at least, beyond dispute, a theory of breath- 
less self-sacrifice. One of the greatest Pagans 
of our day has said : " What I look to, is the 
time when the impulse to help our fellows 
shall be as immediate and as irresistible as 
that which I feel to grasp something if I am 
falling." In such a conception of life, call it 
by what name we will, " Jesus of Nazareth 
passeth by." The Christian doctrine is in 
many cases most vividly expressed by an out- 
sider, perhaps because he takes a fresher view 
of it. A sensible religious writer has put it 
in this way : — 



 

" The Christian law is the law of love. Whoever 
puts the rules of art above the law of love is a 
Pagan. He who habitually seeks to gratify his 
own tastes rather than to do good to all men as he 
has opportunity, is not a Christian but a Pagan." 

Now, whatever else he was or was not, and 
whatever he meant or did not mean, Jesus 
Christ was essentially an unworldly man. The 
question is not, Are we all to become evangel- 
ists, and pool our property, and allow our- 
selves to be thrashed by bullies ? Shall Beacon 
Street adopt the table manners of Caper- 
naum ? Shall the talUJi of Palestine be made 
the fashion in the New England climate ? 
The question is, What would the Founder of 
our faith do in our situation ? Have we got at 
the sense of it ? Have we applied Christian- 
ity? Have we made a science of the divine 
art whose principles he impersonated ? Have 
we the genius of self-sacrifice ? Have we the 
passion of unworldliness ? 

There is a fruit-market in Boston which has 
existed for thirty years upon the whims of the 
rich. Hamburg grapes at ten dollars a pound 
are regularly in stock. In the winter, straw- 
berries and asparagus sell easily at three dol- 







lars a box or a bunch. When the first Florida 
berries come, thirteen in a cup, at four dollars 
a cup, parties are supplied. One hundred and 
twenty-five dollars' worth of fruit to a single 
order causes the dealer no surprise. 

A Chinese vase of sang de boeuf finds a 
purchaser comfortably at five thousand dol- 
lars. The famous peach-blow vase was sold 
for fourteen thousand. A mantelpiece costing 
five thousand dollars is no startling feature 
in our homes. The catalogue price of Ivan- 
Romanoff, the Siberian wolf-hound, in the last 
New York dog-show, was ten thousand dol- 
lars. A horse sold the other day for fifty 
thousand, and a distinguished philanthropist 
pronounced him " cheap at that." There is 
a single stone slab valued at forty thousand 
dollars, laid in front of a well-known private 
dwelling in New York. It is no uncommon 
thing to give fifty thousand dollars for a rac- 
ing-yacht ; the average cost of repairs or im- 
provements on such a boat, while in dock be- 
tween regattas, would maintain an economical 
family for a year. One thousand dollars a 
week for the support of a cruising-boat is a 
familiar figure. Twenty thousand dollars for 



 



a woman's dress is not an unknown price. 
The jewelry of our ladies has reached such 
value that they dare not wear their gems ; 
such pricelessness is sewn into invisible seams 
that female fashion on a summer tour is a 
temptation to a train wrecker. It is a well- 
known fact that many families have aban- 
doned the use of their silver, which finds a 
lodging in a safe deposit vault, while the din- 
ner-table is decorated, and the burglar defied, 
with plated ware. It is perfectly understood 
that paste rests upon fair bosoms, while the 
diamond glitters at the banker's. Some years 
since it was found that the expenditure for 
the maintenance of the royal stables exceeded 
the entire sum set apart for public education 
in Great Britain. The Bishop of Manchester 
once read to his congregation the following 
passage, saying that he had received it from 
a young lady who wished to know what time 
there was in her life for Christian work : — 

" We breakfast about ten. Breakfast occupies 
the best part of an hour, during which we read our 
letters and pick up the latest news in the papers. 
After that we have to go and answer our letters, 
and my mother expects me to write her notes of 



invitation or to reply to such. Then I have to go 
into the conservatory and feed the canaries and 
parrots, and cat off the dead leaves and faded 
flowers from the plants. Then it is time to dress 
for lunch, and at two o'clock we lunch. At three 
my mother likes me to go with her when she makes 
her calls, and we then come home to a five-o'clock 
tea, when some friends drop in. After that we get 
ready to take our drive in the park, and then we go 
home to dinner ; and after dinner we go to the 
theatre or the opera ; and then when we get home 
I am so dreadfully tired that I don't know what 
to do." 

" It 's not the rents I look to," said the 
undertaker-landlord of a wretched tenement 
block in London to Octavia Hill; "it's the 
deaths I get out of the houses." Some years 
ago fashionable New York did penance by a 
spurt of charity in the then famous case of 
James Howard, an industrious, sober, honest 
American, who threw a stone into a plumber's 
window, and stole a few brass faucets to buy 
bread for children who were starving, and for 
a wife dying of consumption. For a few 
days the unsavory street where he lived 
glittered with liveried carriages, whose occupants 



 



amused themselves by playing My Lady Bountiful
to that astounded family, and then rolled 
away to the next new scene in the private 
theatricals of gay life. 

In a New England town the other day, a 
newsboy, hardly higher than the platform, was 
run over by a horse - car and fatally hurt. 
What did this self-supporting baby of six 
years, when writhing in the last agonies of a 
terrible death ? He called piteously for his 
mother. To shriek upon her breast ? That she 
might clasp him while the surgeon worked ? 
To give her his day's earnings. " I 've saved 
'em mother," he cried. "I 've saved 'em all. 
Here they are." When his little clenched, 
dirty hand fell rigid, it was found to contain 
four cents. . 

The city of Detroit may yet remember the 
case of " Gertie," which touched the press of 
the country at the time. A passer through 
Clinton Street one day observed a little Irish 
boy hiding in a door-way and crying. A sym- 
pathetic inquiry brought to light one of the 
most exquisite stories ever recorded of the sick 
poor. In a wretched cellar a little girl of ten 
lay very ill. The window-panes were broken 


(it was March, by the way) and variously 
stuffed. For one pane the supply of tenement 
upholstery had given out. The wind and the 
boys looked in easily. Just within range of 
curious eyes the cot of the sick child was 
stretched. The gamins of Clinton Street dis- 
covered her plight. One little fellow dropped 
an orange through the broken glass ; a plain- 
tive voice thanked the unseen giver gratefully. 
This touching mercy became the fashion in 
that poor neighborhood. Every day saw the 
cubs of the street cuddling like cossets outside 
that window. Wisps of evergreen swept out 
of florists' doors, broken flowers thrown away, 
offerings of fruit with the decayed part cut 
out — every delicacy for the sick that the re- 
sources of Clinton Street admitted of, went 
through that broken pane. One little fellow 
begged a bunch of frozen Malaga grapes from 
a dealer, to whom he offered his ragged cap 
in payment. One day the boys said, "Our 
Gertie is dead," and the Christian street-boys 
became the mourners behind the hearse of the 
starved and frozen child. 

Now, can any of us dare to say that a state 
of civilization in which such things are not 



 



only possible, but in which such extremes of 
human ease and misery are tolerated as the 
necessary conditions of society, represents the 
Christianity of Christ ? Says Isaac Taylor : — 

" To insure its large purpose of good - will to 
man, the law of Christ spreads out its claims very 
far beyond the circle of mere pity or natural kind- 
ness, and in absolute and peremptory terms de- 
mands for the use of the poor, the ignorant, the 
wretched — and demands from every one who 
names the name of Christ — the whole residue of 
talents, wealth, time that may remain after primary 
claims have been satisfied." 

I do not forget that we are thought to be 
the most charitable people on the face of the 
earth. I do not forget the vast machinery of 
our public relief and the reputable organiza- 
tion of our church benevolence, nor the dew 
of our private mercies ; but, taking us at our 
highest, and our attempts to live the un- 
worldly life at their strongest, and the entire 
pitiful result at its best, I wonder that the 
Lord of the Christian religion does not whip 
us out of our bric-a-brac lives, and the whole 
temple of humanity that we have degraded, 
with the fine lash of his holy scorn. 





Next to the personal consecration of Christ, 
we come upon the fundamental principle of 
his superb liberality. It would be incredible, 
if it were not so familiar a fact as to give a 
trite thought, that the followers of this gen- 
erous-hearted Leader should have squarely 
turned their backs upon his precept and per- 
formance in this regard. Bigotry may be 
called the ecclesiastical vice, as worldliness is 
the personal one of the Christian cultus. Shel- 
ley and Leigh Hunt, talking together once, 
in their light, literary way, made this mem- 
orable concession to Christianity : " What 
might not this religion do, if it relied on char- 
ity, not on creed ? " The worst of it is, that 
the progress of time, which, after all, does 
something for most of us in most respects, 
does not seem to have advanced us radically 
in this. The Inquisition changes its basis, 
that is all. A child inquired with terror, 
on first hearing of the Andover controversy, 
" Are they heretics, Mamma ? Will they be 
burned ? " For the rack and the molten Vir- 
gin, we have the ordination service and the 
examination before the Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions. The torture by 



 



insomnia has only taken on a finer phase. A 
good man who is not sure that the Bible in- 
sists upon belief in everlasting damnation as a 
condition of reliable character, is pronounced 
unfit to teach to cannibals the elements of 
Christian courtesy. There is no doubt that 
young men of the finest dedication and most 
original disposition of thought are warned out 
of our pulpits to-day by the theological tor- 
ture-chamber through which a virile conscience 
must pass before the authority of the church 
is laid upon the longing to preach the gospel 
of love to men. Robert Ingersoll is the direct 
descendant of the Westminster Confession. 
" Brethren," cried Cromwell to the framers of 
that moral rack, " I beseech you in the bowels 
of the Lord, believe it possible that you may 
be mistaken ! " 

In a Southern town known to the writer, 
seven churches of different sects exist. Not 
one is able to support a pastor. Itinerants of 
different denominations visit this interesting 
and typical place by turns. One Sunday you 
have Hobson's choice of your Methodist ; the 
next you must play Lutheran; and so on. 
The whole village turns out, and prays ac- 





cordingly. The days of worship are known 
as Baptist Sunday, or Orthodox Sunday, or 
Universalist Sunday, or whatever it may be. 
" But when," asked a visitor to this extraor- 
dinary people, " when is the Lord's Day ? " 

A stranger happening in at Dean Stanley's 
service came away once saying: "I went to 
learn the way to heaven ; I was told the way 
to Palestine." The case is similar with us in 
this wise. Many and dreary are the times 
that we go to the religion of our day to learn 
the way to heaven, and we are taught the way 
to a creed. We go panting with spiritual 
thirst and aching with spiritual hunger ; we 

are fed with theological stones. We go long- 
ing for peace ; we find a sword. We go in 
search of a divine Master ; we get the evan- 
gelical council. We seek the holy and the 
humble instruction that trains a soul for the 
sacred diploma of the religious teacher ; we 
find a lawsuit. We seek the cross of Christ ; 
we find the Supreme Court. 

It is a well-known fact that ardent workers 
in the temperance movement find the grog- 
shops and the churches their chief obstacles. 
You soon learn to count the liquor-dealer and 



 



the communicant almost equally out of rank 
with you in your solitary battle. You must 
bring your drunkard to the vestry, or he may 
as well go drink. You must save your " re- 
formed man " in the denomination, or you 
may collect your library and piano for the 
club-room — as very likely you will — from 
the impenitent world. I was once present at 
a touching scene where the sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper was administered in the pres- 
ence of a crowd of fallen men, struggling for 
a new life. These poor fellows could not have 
borne so much as the odor of the sacred wine ; 
it would have set their bodies and souls on 
fire. Pure water filled the nicked-plated tank- 
ard of the communion service. The bread 
and the water of life were blessed before the 
wistful gaze of these reverent castaways. The 
clergyman officiating, an old man who had 
dedicated his age to the temperance work, and 
a dozen poor, obscure, unflocked church-mem- 
bers in the communicants' seats, were the only 
representatives of the church of Christ pres- 
ent at a scene which was a matter of intense 
public interest in the city, and of severe eccle- 
siastical blame to the temperance people. 





It is amazing that we should even have to 
remind ourselves that with all this dead-line 
of religious respectability the Founder of our 
faith had no more to do than he had with 
the moral example of Herod. Christ was the 
come-outer of the day. He was the Protest- 
ant ; he was the Liberal ; he was the victim 
of spiritual independence. His was the faith 
that rises 

" Just to scorn the consequence, 
And just to do the thing." 

His teaching was one thrilling protest against 
ecclesiasticism. His life was one pathetic plea 
for religious freedom. Love thy God and thy 
neighbor, and follow me; his command and 
our duty are in those few and simple words. 
He cut down doctrinism and dogmatism as a 
mower cuts down thistles. In his insistence 
on practical holiness there was no room for 
chatter about creeds. He gave himself to God 
and to miserable men. This fervent young 
rabbi had no time to formulate a " Shorter 
Catechism." 

Fancy, for the nonce, our Lord appointed 
chairman of the examining committee of a 
heresy-hunting church to-day. One imagines 



the eloquent silence with which he would sit 
out the accepted tests of fitness for member- 
ship in his visible church. What does the 
candidate believe concerning the total deprav- 
ity of all mankind ? Is he aware that he com- 
mitted the sin of Adam ? What are his views 
upon the eternal damnation of the finally im- 
penitent ? Has he faith in the sanctity of im- 
mersion? Does he accept the sacrament of 
infant sprinkling? Test his knowledge of the 
Trinity. Try his theory of the nature and 
office of the Holy Ghost. Is he sound upon 
the doctrine of election ? Does he totter upon 
justification by faith ? 

Now conceive it to be the turn of the mute 
presiding Officer to put questions to the can- 
didate. One may imagine that the test-ques- 
tions for religious character would now take a 
surprising turn. Have you a pure heart ? 
Do you love the Lord your God with the 
whole of it ? Explain to us your relation with 
your neighbors. Are you beloved in your 
home? Can you control your temper? Do 
you talk scandal? Are you familiar with 
the condition of the poor ? What are your 
methods of relieving it? Can you happily 





give disagreeable service to the sick? How 
do you bear physical suffering when it falls 
to your own lot ? How many drunkards have 
you tried to reform ? What outcasts have you 
sought to save ? What mourners have you 
comforted ? On what social theory do you in- 
vite guests to your house ? What proportion 
of your income do you give to the needs of 
others ? What do you understand by prayer 
to God ? What is your idea of a Christ-like 
life? 

The third vital characteristic of the Chris- 
tianity of Christ plainly consists in his unspar- 
ing and unswerving democracy. It is not pos- 
sible to put too great an emphasis upon this 
fixed and terribly-neglected truth. We say 
in glib familiar phrase that the basis of Chris- 
tianity is the brotherhood of humanity — what 
has been usefully called the " enthusiasm of hu- 
manity." Not one in twenty of us realizes that 
this means an ideal of daily life as far above 
our own as the centre of the solar system is 
above the level of the sea. Which of us gives 
the recognition of imitation to the astonishing 
example of Jesus in this regard? Christ was 





the educated and sanctified socialist. He was 
the consistent democrat. He was the conse- 
crated agitator. Social rank simply did not 
exist for him. Caste he scorned. A fisherman 
was his most intimate friend. He accepted 
the hospitality of an ostracized man. He con- 
versed fearlessly and naturally with abandoned 
women. He did not refuse to penitent out- 
casts the preciousness of his personal friend- 
ship. He was never known to shrink from 
foul diseases. Vulgar natures he treated with 
the patience of high refinement. The " com- 
mon people " loved him. He denounced the 
fashionable shams of his times with the non- 
chalance of an emperor and the intelligence 
of an artisan. He scathed the petty preten- 
sions of the leaders of society with that in- 
difference to criticism characteristic of high 
birth, and that sympathy with what we call 
the " lower classes " incident to a personal ex- 
perience of poverty. His social theories held 
the relentlessness of love. There is no polite 
way of evading them. There is no well-bred 
opportunity of ignoring them. The Chris- 
tianity of Christ must meet them point-blank. 
They are its essential test. They are its first 





and final demand. Malthus has reminded us 
that the histories of mankind which we possess 
are, in general, only histories of the higher 
classes. Authentic Christianity must be a 
history of the masses. Socially considered, a 
Christian must be, in a sense, interestingly 
varied from the old theological one, " born 
again." He has new kin, he makes new neigh- 
bors, he incurs new social obligations, he read- 
justs his position in human society, or he 
might as well go call himself a Druid. 

The fashionable church has received its full 
share of derision, from critics who may not be 
worthy of a back seat iu it ; but that does not 
affect the fact that it deserves all it gets. The 
recent popular attack upon the pew-rental sys- 
tem may not be made altogether from a de- 
vout point of view ; none the less it will do 
good. Sexton Williams has let fly a fiery- 
winged truth ; and the girl - reporter who 
found herself welcomed by only five New York 
churches, although employed in the service of 
the newspapers rather than of the Lord, has 
put her shabbily-gloved finger upon the spot 
where the tuberculosis of our religious system 
sets in. It is the undecorated fact, that if 



 



Jesus Christ were to enter almost any of our 
influential churches to-day he would be shown 
into the back gallery ; and he could not obtain 
admission to our parlors without a letter of 
introduction from some person in our " set." 
" You will find," says a nice observer, "that 
so far as people are reached by religious wor- 
ship outside of their especial religious belief, 
it is the social recognition which has won 
them." 

In a luxurious home, whose invitations are 
not declined, whose hospitality is familiar to 
many distinguished men and women of our 
land, there may be found, any day, mingled 
with the most gifted guests, plain, poor, ob- 
scure people, quite unknown in " society." I 
once saw, at a breakfast at this house, the 
foremost poet in the country seated beside a 
massage rubber, a poor girl training herself 
for the practice of medicine, and in need of 
two things — a good breakfast and a glimpse 
into the cultivated world. She had both, in 
the Lord's name, in that Christian home. Yet 
the spirit of that ideal hospitality is so rare 
that we tell of it as we do of heroic deeds. 
The Christianity of Christ would make it so 





common that we should notice it only as we do 
the sunrise. 

There does not exist outside of the New 
Testament such a conception of the Christian 
spirit as the great Frenchman (not distin- 
guished for ecclesiastical views of God, but ex- 
iled for his practical love of man) gave us in 
the greatest work of fiction since Shakespeare. 
Who forgets the Bishop in " Les Miserables," 
immortal because he acted like Christ? His 
palace was converted into a hospital, his in- 
come expended for the suffering. Out of the 
luxuries of his highly civilized past, the " spir- 
itual man of the world " (as Margaret Fuller 
would put it) had saved an elegant toilet-case, 
a few silver plates, and silver candlesticks. 
" Knock there" said the citizen to the ex- 
galley-slave whom no other roof would shelter. 

" The Bishop touched his hand gently, and 
said : — 

" ' You need not tell me who you are. This is 
not my house ; it is the house of Christ. It does 
not ask any comer whether he has a name, but 
whether he has an affliction.' " 



In all uninspired literature what is finer 



 



than the scene between the Bishop and Val- 
jean, when the gendarmes bring the arrested 
guest and silver back to this threshold of su- 
perhuman hospitality. 

" ' Ah, there you are ! ' said Monseigneur ; " I am 
glad to see you. But I gave you the candlesticks 
also, which are silver like the rest and would bring 
you two hundred francs. Why did you not take 
them along with your plate ? ? " 

Left alone with the astounded thief, the 
Christian idealist grew stern and solemn : — 

" ' Never forget that you have promised me to 
use this silver to become an honest man. . . . Jean 
Valjean, my brother, you belong no longer to evil 
but to good. It is your soul that I am buying for 
you. I withdraw it from dark thoughts and from 
the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God ! ' " 

The child of such a spiritual god-father, 
who wonders that Jean Valjean, the galley 
slave, becomes Mayor Madeleine, the saint of 
a district, and the protector of every despised 
and rejected creature in it ? It is thus that 
the Christianity of Christ ought to be spir- 
itually inherited. The idea cultivated by the 
liturgic church, that the laying-on of apostolic 





hands creates an ancestry of priestly power, 
is a pleasant fancy, pale beside what might be 
the tremendous facts of moral heredity in the 
Christian life. The possibilities of culture in 
this direction are unfathomed. Said Daniel 
Webster, in his private confession of faith : — 

" I believe that the experiments and subtleties of 
human wisdom are more likely to obscure than to 
enlighten the revealed will of God, and that he is 
the most accomplished scholar who has been edu- 
cated at the feet of Jesus, and in the College of 
Fishermen." 

When all is said, it comes to this : Type, 
not argument, governs men ; and the Christ- 
type will control the world just as soon as and 
no sooner than it is consistent, simple, ardent, 
and sincere. Christianity cannot expect to 
become a science on inattention which would 
destroy the perfection of a phonograph, nor 
to conquer society by a series of " bolting " 
experiments which would defeat any political 
party known to civilized nations. Common 
sense holds the balance of power in religion as 
much as it does in affairs. There is what we 
may call a common spirituality, to which hu- 
man respect always defers. The Christianity 



 



of Christ necessitates a personal consecration 
fanned to a white-heat that burns to ashes all 
the ordinary standards of conduct ; involves a 
religious toleration " all love, and of love all 
worthy ; " requires an estimate of social val- 
ues absolutely revolutionary to our accepted 
models. 

The time can come, and if it can, it must, 
when the New Testament shall be intelligently 
adapted to the twentieth century. The time 
must come, and if it must, it can, when spir- 
itual caste shall be the only basis of social 
rank. If Christ's life means anything, this 
is inevitable. The imagination falters before 
the progress of a consecrated sociology. It 
would be an interesting science to a cynic, and 
fascinating to an enthusiast. " The night is 
far spent, O householders," said Gautama; 
" it is time for you to do what you deem 
most fit." 

It has been well said that all problems re- 
solve themselves into the problem of personal 
righteousness. The key to our perplexities 
lies no further than a devout and dedicated 
heart. The life of the Nazarene will bewilder 
society with astigmatic optical interpretations 





not an hour beyond the time when we bring 
to bear upon it the lens of a public purity that 
shuts out private difference or default ; as for- 
eign war called from the bickering Hellenes 
" Greek curses to Persia 59 and " Greek tears 
to Athens." 

Outside of touching individual exceptions, 
which prove the rule with a kind of divine 
silence and shame like that in which our 
Master wrote with his finger on the ground in 
the presence of the erring woman, the Chris- 
tianity of Christ is an unachieved ideal ; but 
it is as practicable as that of truth or honor. 
And, after all, it is one of our " literary 
class " who has put the whole argument for 
us in these reverberating words : — 

" If Jesus Christ is a man, 
And only a man, I say 
That of all mankind I cleave to him ? 
And to him will cleave alway. 

" If Jesus Christ is a God, 
And the only God, I swear 
I will follow Him through heaven and hell, 
The earth, the sea, and the air ! " 



In February, 1882, there was organized in 
London a society which had what one is half 
tempted to call the opportunity of the cen- 
tury in its hands. In these days, — when the 
multiple power of the unit has reached a point 
of social infliction which makes every fresh 
combination of human beings an object of 
dread, if not of suspicion ; when the well-in- 
structed citizen adds to his litany : " Deliver 
us from associations, and lead us not into 
committees ! " when people who draw up a 
constitution and by-laws, for any purpose 
whatever, must show their charter, or stand 
back in the name of over-organized humanity, 
— it is much to say of any newly associated 
effort that its final cause seems so adequate as 
that of the Society for Psychical Research. 
The prospectus of this society says : — 
" It has been widely felt that the present is an 





opportune time for making an organized and sys- 
tematic attempt to investigate that large group of 
debatable phenomena designated by such terms as 
mesmeric, psychical, and spiritualistic. From the re- 
corded testimony of many competent witnesses, past 
and present, including observations recently made 
by scientific men of eminence in various countries, 
there appears to be, amidst much illusion and de- 
ception, an important body of remarkable phe- 
nomena, which are primd facie inexplicable on 
any generally recognized hypothesis, and which, if 
incontestably established, would be of the highest 
possible value." 

It is not necessary to quarrel with the as- 
sertion of the well-known and well-informed 
gentlemen who stand sponsors for this society, 
when they proceed to say that 

" The task of examining such residual phenom- 
ena has often been undertaken by individual effort, 
but never hitherto by a scientific society organized 
on a sufficiently broad basis." 

When the greatest intellectual discovery of 
our times was made, it was wrought out of the 
inductive method, inch by inch, laboriously, 
consistently, and triumphantly. The theory 
of evolution was a masterpiece of loving toil, 




and of relentless logic. Darwin  was twenty- 
two years in collecting and controlling the ma- 
terial for the " Origin of Species " and the 
"Descent of Man." Wallace, who competed 
with him for the formulation of the evolu- 
tionary law, was submerged like one of their 
own shells in the waves that beat upon the 
shores of the Malay archipelago. These men 
gave their souls and bodies to become students 
of the habits of a mollusk or a monkey, the 
family peculiarities of a bug or a bird, the 
private biographies of a mastodon or a polyp, 
the measurable but imperceptible movement 
of a glacier, the ancestry of a parasite, the 
vanity of a butterfly, the digestion of a fly- 
catcher, the moral nature of a climbing plant, 
or the journey of an insect from one desert 
island to another upon a floating bough. 

Induction, which is as familiar as Bacon, 
and as old as philosophy, became, in the 
hands of the " Greatest since Newton," an ap- 

 "It occurred to me," lie says, "in 1837, that some- 
thing might perhaps be made out on this question by pa- 
tiently accumulating and reflecting. . . . After five years' 
work, I allowed myself to speculate on the subject . . . from that 
period to the present day, I have steadily pursued the same 
object." — Introduction to Origin of Species, published in 
1859. 




plied force which has taught the century — 
nay, which has taught all time and all truth 
— a solemn lesson. Two things are needed 
to the discovery of a great principle : the 
power to attend, and the power to infer. We 
might add a third, the power to imagine, 
which may be overlooked in the construction 
of important theory ; but, whatever may be 
said of that, the power to attend, coming first 
in order, must be first considered. Darwin's 
colossal success was owing, to an extent which 
it is impossible for a lesser mind to measure, to 
his almost supernatural power of attention to 
the natural ; his superhuman patience of ob- 
servation and record. He observed and re- 
corded as no other man of our day has done ; 
his power of inference proved equal to his ob- 
serving and recording power ; and we have the 
doctrine of evolution by which physical science 
has been the first, but will not be the last, may 
even prove to be the least of human interests 
yet to profit unspeakably. 

It would seem that the trained minds called 
to the leadership of the new psychical move- 
ment have been prompt to turn the geist of 
the century in the last direction in which we 



 



should have looked for it. The current that 
wrought marvels out of stocks and stones they 
propose to pour upon air and essence. What 
conquered matter shall assail mind. What 
ordered order shall dominate the disorderly. 
The scientific method shall now rule the un- 
scientific madness, and we shall see what we 
shall see. 

In the metaphysical and in the physical 
worlds the legal fibre is essentially the same* 
The material differs more than the method* 
In this case there exists one distinction : that 
it is in a peculiar sense to the help of the un- 
learned that the learned have appealed in the 
work of the psychical organizations. Here is 
a mass of, let us say, asserted but unverified 
fact, which, if true, is of immeasurable im- 
portance to the interests of the human race. 
Such verification is not, as yet, to be found 
in libraries or in laboratories. Telescope and 
microscope, chip-hammer and retort, do not 
serve the case. The literature of the subject 
is, in great part, untested, illegal, whimsical, 
prehistoric to the spirit of the scientific era, 
and to the spirit in which, if at all, such a 
subject must now be approached. Here we 





have to deal with an inchoate accumulation 
of mind-facts or soul-facts, of which the mind 
or the soul must be clerk, witness, judge, and 
juror. Here, especially, we have to do with 
confused freshets and land-slides of material 
which, preeminently above other material that 
science has sought to arrange and label, de- 
pends upon the intelligence and veracity of 
human beings for its classification. Here, in 
short, we come yesterday, to-day, and forever, 
jaggedly against the supreme difficulties at- 
taching to the validity and credibility of tes- 
timony. Here, because of the supremacy of 
these difficulties, superstition and science must 
not shoot, but grapple. 

Hence, we see, with a keen sense of their 
wisdom, the officers of the psychical societies 
appealing, at the outset, to the public for co- 
operation in the work of investigating that 
which is hidden, not in desert islands, or in 
glaciers, or in craters, or in crucibles, or in 
cuneiform inscriptions, but in human experi- 
ence. On human intelligence and veracity 
the test must strike ; it would seem that the 
electric light of science blazes white enough 
now, if ever, to try them. Did it seem a du-
