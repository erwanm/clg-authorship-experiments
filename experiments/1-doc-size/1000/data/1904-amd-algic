dered. 

"You don't look well," she began in her mellifluous 
tones. "You are thin and pale. Do you know I used 
to think you were quite a pretty little girl, but I sup 
pose we all do go off some," laughing. "I tell mother 
I never want to be a horrid-looking old woman like 
granny. Wasn't she frightful? So I hope I'll die 
somewhere along midde life, when I can make a decent- 
looking corpse. And Norman's coming home ! Don't 
you suppose if Norman had stayed here you would 
have married him instead of Dan?" 

"I think Dan made me marry him," I gasped, as if 
the words were wrested from me. 

"He's awfully imperious, isn't he? I suppose you 
give in to his whims, but the way to keep your charm 
over such a man is to deny him, to dispute with him 
up-and-down quarrels, and the making up is delicious ! 
Marriage is queer, isn't it, and the wrong people do get 
together! Is the old couplet true 



 

" 'There's a house 'tother side of the way, 
And there they make Lucifer matches ?' " 

Another customer entered, and Polly turned to her. 
My parcel came. I paid for it and went out. 

If Norman had not gone away would I have mar 
ried him? 

I did not know anything about marriage in that in 
nocent childhood. Norman staying right along, and 
we growing nearer each other, reading the same books, 
enjoying thrilling or tender verses, walks and talks, 
and then I knew there would not have been any re 
pulsion, that I should have been glad, glad with su 
preme joy, just as Sophie had been. 

I laid the package down on the table. Father was in 
his office, but I could not go in. I went up to our 
room, took off my bonnet and glanced around. Dan 
had been in and changed his clothes. Trousers thrown 
over a chair, collar and stock on the bureau, shoes 
and a soiled handkerchief on the floor. Dan had gone 
off somewhere. The most curious repulsion came over 
me. I could not touch one article to put them away. 
Oh, if I could run away somewhere but there was 
father. Keeping together "as long as ye both do 
live." 

"Ruth!" called father. 

It might have been minutes or hours, it seemed an 
endless while to me. 

"Did you get the paper? Come down. I want to 
make out some bills. Dan's gone to Batavia for two 
days, left his good-by. Why, Ruth, you look like a 
ghost, what is the matter?" 





"Do I?" I tried to laugh, but my mouth was stiff, 
and I felt numb all over. "I don't think it anything. 
I may have walked too fast. The sun is hot." 

He put me in the big rocking chair. I picked up 
a fan. I was cold enough, Heaven knew, but I wanted 
to make some movement. 

"Ruth, I think you are not well. You grow thinner 
all the time, and you have no flesh to lose. We must 
have the doctor. Child, I have been comforting my 
self that matters were better with you " 

His kindly eyes were full of solicitude. 

I made a great effort. "If you mean with Dan," 
I said, "they are. He is much pleasanter. I think he 
has gotten over the trouble about the house, though 
sometimes I have wondered whether he might not have 
it when I am gone." 

"No," father replied, almost with set teeth. "You 
need not go for that. I'm not sure but it would be 
better for you to deed it back to me. Still if things 
go on, well " 

He hobbled to the closet and brought me some wine. 
That refreshed me. Then he opened the package, 
made out some bills, straightened his accounts when 
it was supper-time. 

John came over in the evening, and father would 
keep him all night. I felt quite as well as usual. 
When I went upstairs I laid the soiled things away, 
hung up his trousers, but his vest fell to the floor, and 
his knife and pencil rolled out with a bit of paper. I 
put the two back, crumpled up the paper, then be 
thought myself it might be a memorandum of some- 



 

thing and spread it out, took it over to the candle. It 
was a pencil scrawl. 

"You will find me at Weesaukie's lodge at twi 
light." It was not Dan's writing. 

There was no name. He had taken Duke and gone 
in the buggy. Was he to have a companion? It 
turned me sick and cold again. Polly's glittering, 
mocking eyes and her insolent tones with their half 
veiled gayety swept over me. Was it would it be 
Polly? Oh, no, no, Dan could not do such a thing as 
that! 

For all Polly's brave show of mourning it was 
whispered that her married life had not been altogether 
serene, and that she made little ado about the loss of 
her grandeur. 

All night something haunted me, a kind of imper 
sonal agency, treacherous, trying to lure me some 
where in darkness and vagueness, while I had to make 
a great effort to hold back. And then I was wandering 
over wild, dreary prairie land, at last coming out to 
a strange black, silent lake. What splashed into it? 
The cry woke me, and my heart beat with a great 
terror. 

"John," I said to the young cousin, "I want you to 
go down to the Morrison house this noon and take a 
note, but do not give it to any one except Polly. If 
she isn't home, and she may not be, you say it is all 
right, and be sure to bring the note back to me. Don't 
leave your name or anything. Come back to 
night." 

It was a daring thing if Polly was home. 





I busied myself about household duties, and in the 
afternoon a neighbor came in with her two little ones. 
What made every one so anxious to know how much 
fortune Norman would have? Still I was glad of the 
break, for father had gone out to look after the men. 
The weather was fine and he was anxious to get in 
some of the crops. Then he took a rest in his easy 
chair. 

I walked down the street a short distance. John 
came hurrying along whistling, but stopped, thrust his 
hand in his pocket. 

"She wasn't home, Cousin Ruth. The woman 
wanted the note, but I wouldn't give it to her. She 
told me to come on Friday." 

"Yes," I returned breathlessly. "Do not mention 
it to father," and I took the missive. 

Then Polly was away as well ! 

Dan came home late Friday night, good natured, 
bustling, and announced that he must start early the 
next morning for Galena on some important business. 
He hoped I had not missed him much. He was sorry 
to go away at this busy season, but he would make it 
all right with father. Indeed, he began to think with 
so much business of his own they would really need a 
regular overseer. 

"Now if that Gaynor boy was four or five years 
older, he might come." 

I was thunderstruck. "I thought you did not like 
him," I half faltered. 

"I don't, but your father seems to like him." 

The tone was rather sarcastic. I made no reply. I 



 

was glad he did not proffer me so much as a kiss. In 
five minutes he was asleep. 

So to Galena he went the next morning after a brief 
colloquy with father. 

"I'd like to know what's got into Dan Hayne," 
father said, almost angrily. "I s'pose he's had a streak 
of luck somewhere, he's gay as a lark, but he is sober 
enough, and I'm pretty sure he hasn't been off on a 
carouse. I suppose it is all right between you ?" study 
ing me sharply. 

"It was all pleasant, if that is what you mean." 

He nodded, but did not look satisfied. 

"I'll have to hunt up Jake Esden and I suppose he 
will be too busy to lend a hand. This kind of weather 
can't last. If I wasn't such a battered old hulk!" 

I clasped my arms around his neck, but I did not 
sigh nor sob, though both rose in my heart. Whatever 
came it would be we two. 

"We'll have a week to ourselves anyhow," he said, in 
a gratified tone. 

A week in which to be glad that the husband of one's 
life would be away. What a bitter travesty it was. 
But this time Polly was home, making preparations to 
go to Vincennes for quite a stay. 



CHAPTER XVIII 



DAN 



I WAS all alone that August afternoon. It was hot out 
on the porch and I took my sewing inside. I liked to 
sew when anything perplexed me. There seems a 
quiet kind of diversion in the effort one has to make, 
which is not much of an effort, after all. Father had 
gone down to the warehouse to see about loading one 
of the boats. One of the men was with him, though 
he had learned to get about quite comfortably. 

I heard a step on the walk. Dan's week was up and 
he might be home any day. It had been a pleasant 
and busy week, and it seemed as if most of the people 
I had ever known had visited me. There was my old 
friend, Mrs. Chadwick, who had come for her brother. 
He was rather ailing now, and it was thought a change 
would benefit him, so she would take him home with 
her. She was still sweet and charming and intelligent 
and we had a pleasant visit. Sophie came up with the 
four children, and we enjoyed a merry, romping time. 
Of course, she couldn't let Polly alone, but she ad 
mitted the matter might have worn itself out, and now 



 

she was preparing to take quite a journey. "Joy go 
with her," declared Sophie. 

Ben had returned, a fine, fresh-looking fellow, tall 
and with a strong frame, rather thin now, but he was 
full of ambition. He had been doing very well, and 
oh, what joy it would be to see Norman, the most 
splendid fellow in the world. Any day he might 
arrive. 

Chris, too, was full of delight. I had no time to 
brood over my own infelicities. 

No one had come yet to-day. It was too warm for 
womenkind to go visiting even with the prospect of a 
supper in which they had had no hand. 

So when I heard the step I did not stir, neither did 
I take the next stitch, but just listened for the voice. 
Chris had a way of beginning his conversation on the 
lowest step and talking all the way along. It must be 
Ben, stopping to pet the cat. Then I turned, but could 
not see who was in the hall, rose, and took a step 
forward, and then we stood face to face with all 
the years between. I was no longer a little girl, and 
this was a fine, resolute man, clear eyed, the strong 
features toned down by the tenderness and sympathy 
the years had demanded of him, a face one could 
trust to the death Norman Hayne in his ripe man 
hood. 

There came to me in that one instant a flash of 
awful knowledge that I had no right to. I swayed 
uncertainly. I put out my hand and all went dark 
before my eyes. 

"Oh, Little Girl! Little Girl!" 





The longing sweetness of the voice pierced my very 
soul, but I went plunging down some deep abyss. Was 
I really dying? 

When I came to, Jolette and father and a neighbor 
stood there beside Norman. 

"What was the matter?" I asked. "Why, I never 
fainted in my life." 

"Once is always the first time," said Mrs. Miller, 
sententiously. 

Father was pale with fright, and shook as if with 
an ague, while his eyes transfixed mine. 

"I came upon her too suddenly," Norman explained. 
"I was so impatient, and I could not find any one." 

"She has not been well of late," exclaimed father. 

"And it has been a hot afternoon. Oh, how did you 
stand it?" and I caught his hand. 

"I was in a tolerably cool place. There is a breeze 
coming up, and the sun has gone under a cloud." 

"Yes. I think we might take her out on the porch," 
said Mrs. Miller. "Jolette, you carry the big rocking 
chair." 

"I am all right," and I gave a tremulous little laugh. 
"Did I frighten you very much?" 

"It was a pretty severe faint," Norman replied, still 
looking anxiously at me. 

Mrs. Miller would lead me, though I could walk 
very well, and only felt a little shaky. 

The wind came up in a fluttering sort of gale, as if 
it hardly knew whether to behave at its best or worst. 
A drift of mauve and dun began to settle in level lines 
along the west, making a bar across the sun. Other 



 

patches of white and pale gray chased each other about, 
but there was no sign of shower. 

"When did you get in?" asked father. 

"About noon. I went straight to mother. Chris 
was home. Oh, you can't think how glad I am to be 
here. It has been a long exile from the many one 
loves. And yet I ought not complain. I have been 
needed every day of the time. But it seemed so strange 
at the first glance to have every one grown up, al 
though, of course, I knew none of us stood still," and 
he laughed with a cheerful, musical sound. It was 
like a mellow echo of Dan's. And he was a refined 
and noble copy of his elder brother, a gentleman in 
tone, accent, the turn of the head, the glance of the 
eye, the sort of atmosphere that surrounded him. I 
thought I would like to have him more distinct in per 
sonality. 

He remained to supper, but went immediately after. 
He wrung father's hand until the pressure made him 
wince, but he said a simple good-night to me, and I 
was thankful. I could not have borne the clasp of his 
hand. 

There was great rejoicing, to be sure. We were 
very neighborly in those days, and joy as well as sor 
row stirred all hearts. Then it was something to 
have been nearly all over Europe, to understand sev 
eral foreign languages, to have seen kings and 
queens. 

A few days after Dan came home. He gave me a 
careless greeting, and began to talk at once about 
Norman. 



"I have not seen much of him," I said. "He and 
father went driving yesterday, and he was surprised at 
what he called the advancement of the prairies." 

"Oh, I suppose he carries his head very high. And 
I dare say he came in for a big fortune. You won't 
see much of him here, I can tell you. We're not half 
grand enough." 

"Your mother is a very happy woman. I went 
down there yesterday, while the men were out. I had 
been so busy with various matters. You must go and 
see her." 

He nodded, and busied himself with some papers he 
was taking out of a drawer. 

That was all our greeting after a week's absence. I 
had a kind of stunned feeling, and did not really 
care for endearments, though sometimes Dan was 
very lavish of them. I had not yet grown used to 
this revelation of myself. I must learn to love my 
husband, it was my only safeguard. Otherwise I 
should be a miserable, sinful woman. For I realized 
now how I had loved Norman Hayne through these 
years of my childhood, and how I could love him now, 
how he would fill the spaces in my heart that had 
never been satisfied. The pain and longing I had 
never understood before. 

There was another aspect to the case. Father's in 
fluence had its share in the step I realized. He had 
not thought then he could live very long, and it was his 
dear love for me that longed to see me safe in some 
one's hands. He suffered enough in knowing that my 
husband had grown careless, he must never guess that 



 

I could have given my supreme affection to another 
and been happy, blessed beyond measure. 

Why had Dan married me? 

He could not have been so much in love with an 
unformed child, though I think I did amuse him with 
my petulance and protests. He loved to conquer any 
thing. He could subdue the most fractious horse and 
do more with an obstinate mule than any one else. He 
really enjoyed my resistance. But was there any 
thought that at father's death I should be left with 
quite a fortune ? There was his anger about the house, 
his objections to young John Gaynor. Yet now they 
seemed matters almost of indifference to him. 

But there was my duty and my safety. Father was 
a very upright man and used to clear distinctions, and 
I knew I had inherited them. I was a wife and I had 
no right to consider what my life might have been with 
any other man, to brood over what I had missed. 

It seemed truly as if Norman helped me. Had I 
done or said anything in that moment of the lapsing of 
consciousness? He came only when father was 
around. Oh, what talks there were out on the porch, 
to which I listened enchanted, yet I sat a little by my 
self, or with father's arm around me. Mrs. Hayne 
gathered the family together, and father went along. 
Four sweet, merry grandchildren, Sophie bright, com 
monplace to be sure, but a most excellent wife and 
mother. We talked of the one who "was not," of the 
night I had come a Little Girl, of the many delightful 
old things. 

Dan was there, but I noted a curious restlessness 



about him, as if he was bored, and an abstraction. His 
thoughts certainly were elsewhere, yet he told droll 
stories and anecdotes and chaffed Norman. When we 
made ready to return Ben said he would go along, he 
had an errand uptown. We were old enough to 
divide our city in sections already. 

"Ben if you'll just see my folks safe home," he 
said, "I'll be mightily obliged to you. I ought to see 
some one on business, and I know I can catch him to 
night." 

"Yes," assented Ben, and then Chris said he would 
go, too. Norman was petting and playing with little 
Ruth. 

Dan walked a short distance with us and then turned 
off with a cheerful good-night. But it was past mid 
night when he returned. 

It seemed so strange to walk on the edge of some 
suspected but unknown danger, as if the ground was 
mined somewhere along the way. I was outwardly 
cheerful, I sang about the house, I tried to answer 
blithely, I cooked the things Dan liked, I begged him 
to come home early. I indulged in little caressing 
ways, such as he used to fairly extort years before. I 
put on whatever semblance of love I could use without 
being effusive. It did not warm him at all, and he had 
been so easily roused. What was this stone that I 
surged against? 

"Ruth," father said one morning, "what is Dan 
about, "has he told you of any new plans?" 

"No," I answered in a kind of surprise. 

"He is putting money in the copper mines up at Lake 



 

Superior. He has sold that Lake Street property, at a 
sacrifice, I think, and he asked me for a settlement. 
He wants to go up to the copper fields himself." 

"No, I have heard nothing about it." 

Father came nearer and took both of my hands. 

"Ruth, you cannot go up there, even with your hus 
band," he exclaimed solemnly. 

"He has not asked me. I do not think he would 
want me." Yet I shuddered at the prospect. 

"One cannot fathom him any more. Of course, he 
was very plausible and all that, considering my interest, 
and saying he had not time to attend to it, that he 
might be away for months, and that now I was so 
much improved a good overseer would answer my pur 
pose. But I say again he shall not take you. I would 
as soon hand you over to a pack of ravening wolves ! 
Oh, my darling, I have no one in the world but you, 
a broken, disabled, lonely old man." 

He pressed me to his heart, and I felt the sob there. 
The strong arms about me gave me inexpressible com 
fort. 

"You need not fear," I returned. "He shall not even 
drag me away." 

"He will not try force. He may try fraud. I dis 
trust him. He used to be so frank and outspoken. 
Will you be careful? Do not be trapped into any 
thing, for he is deep as the sea. It may be all this cop 
per business. I have seen men go mad about specula 
tion before, when they could dance a hornpipe standing 
on their heads, their brains were so befuddled. It is 
not drink, but some curious influence I cannot divine." 





"I shall stay with you always. It was one of the 
conditions of my marriage. It was as solemn a prom 
ise as anything else." 

"Thank God, my darling." 

There certainly was what I should call an intense 
change in Dan, not any superficial emotion. He some 
times sat with his lips compressed, and his brow in a 
frown, then it would suddenly lighten in such a won 
derful glow, an absolute radiance. What was he think 
ing of? 

Once, when I saw it, I went over and kissed him in 
a kind of fascinated mood. 

"Don't !" He pushed me away roughly. 

A month before I would have cried, and felt stabbed 
to the heart. Now I walked quietly away. 

What weeks they were, not many of them, but the 
days seemed shodden with lead, the sun hung high in 
the heavens, as if loth to leave her throne. 

I stayed mostly at home, helping father to go over 
accounts. I remember the last week. Norman was 
not in at all. 

Was I longing for him? Was life drearier without 
him ? Well, if I was as weak as that then I must make 
a new and greater effort. But it was fighting with 
no line of defence behind me, no husband to stretch out 
a hand. 

Dan came in awhile before noon one day and began 
to pack a valise. He had taken away some of his 
belongings before. I had been mending a few articles 
rather too bulky to be carried downstairs. 

"I am going away," he announced, "up to Lake 
Superior. The Prairie Bird starts this afternoon." 



 

"Oh, Dan!" What should I say? "How long are 
you likely to stay ?" and I tried to make my voice solici 
tous. 

There was no answer for a moment or two. Then 
he turned around in a fierce fashion, and his eyes were 
black as night. 

"I may as well tell you," he began in a desperate 
tone, "that I am not coming back at all." 

I glanced up at him. I knew the color went out of 
my face. I was so utterly amazed. 

"You'll hear the story, but I may as well have the 
gratification of telling you." His voice had a peculiar 
depth, and his face was set with some tremendous emo 
tion. "I am going with the woman I love, and who 
loves me with a passion you never could know if you 
lived a hundred years ! I should have married her in 
the beginning, but I was a blind, idiotic fool, and she 
had a temper. We were never sure of each other. 
She made a pretence of caring for this or that one 
when I ought to have wrung the secret out of her heart 
and mastered her once for all. A woman like that 
gives royally when she is compelled. You have to ex 
tort it out of her, but the drop of honey is worth it all. 
The old man who took her in hand never found the 
way to the heart of the flower. That was saved for me. 
And it is a delicious draught. We are going away to 
gether we shall never come back. What people say 
is of no importance to us." 

"It is Polly Morrison," I gasped. "Oh, Dan, if you 
loved her, then why did you marry me?" I cried, 
wounded to the heart's core. 



"Because I was a fool. She had gone out of my life, 
and I said she could not have loved me as she pro 
fessed. And you were a silly little white kitten, never 
quite sure whether you would jump on my knee or 
not, so I made you. But what is there to you? 
Some cold Puritan blood, some petty sort of tender 
ness that has no fire in it nothing to kindle a man 
to the height of rapture. I tired of you even before 
she came, and then my life was set aflame. She is 
the one woman for me. A month, even, with her 
would outweigh any other woman on the face of the 
earth." 

I sprang up. "Dan, your solemn promise !" At that 
moment I hated to be thrust aside for Polly Morrison. 
"You were not compelled to marry me. You you did 
love me then a little." 

He laughed scornfully. "You have just hit it a 
little. A man sometimes takes second best, more fool 
he! You might have done if Polly with all her 
witchery had not crossed my path. Or it might have 
been some one else. There is no need of making a fuss 
now. I have not wasted any of your patrimony. You 
can hand it all over to John Gay nor if you like, and you 
and your father can maunder on through life. And I 
shall have a glowing, thrilling, absorbing atmosphere, 
in which one really lives. No, don't come near 
me" 

The bed had stood between us as I sat by the 
window. Perhaps I had unconsciously stepped for 
ward. I had a wild idea that I must plead, that I must 
exert all my wifely powers to keep him from commit 
ting this dreadful sin. 



 

"Don't come near me," he continued. "We will say 
good-by with this space between us and no tomfoolery. 
Perhaps I was idiotic to come and tell you this, but I 
wanted you to know how the other woman was loved, 
how a man loves when a woman fills every thought of 
his soul. There you and your father are well rid 
of me!" 

He picked up his valise and strode out of the room, 
down the stairs. I dropped on the bed. I did not 
faint or cry. I could hardly be any more deserted than 
I had been the last two months. A deserted wife ! A 
husband by all of God's sacred ordinances who gloried 
in his shameful love for another woman! 

It stunned me. One moment it seemed incredible, 
then his voice sounded clear and vibrant, as if he was 
still in the room. Had we parted for all time? A 
hundred little tendernesses rushed over me. The 
laughing, teasing eyes that could hold so much mean 
ing looked into mine. Oh, he must have loved me once 
and I had tried to love him, yes, sometimes I really 
had, but it was a child's love. 

"Ain't any one comin' to dinner, Mis' Hayne?" A 
peremptory voice rang up the stairway. 

I rose, bathed my face, although there were no tears 
to wash away, and went down. 

"Mr. Hayne gone away?" inquired Jolette. 

"Yes," I answered briefly. 

"An' ye'r father out! I declar' to man ther' ain't 
much sense roastin' ye'sself on a hot day an' no one to 
come an' eat the wittles!" 

I glanced over the table. The boiled dinner with one 


or two side dishes filled me with disgust, and yet I 
thought how Dan would have enjoyed it. He was 
hearty in everything. He had a big frame to take care 
of and he did not stint it. 

The wagon drove up and Sim helped father out. 
So I waited until he was ready to come. 

"The Prairie Bird starts out at two. Has Dan been 
home?" 

"Yes, and gone," I made answer briefly. 

He glanced sharply at me. Jolette was too near for 
any private comment. 

"I saw him down by the elevator. Well, I hope he 
isn't on a wild-goose chase that will bring down only 
a few feathers. Wentworth thinks he's years too early, 
but they may find gold up there as well as in Califor 
nia, and copper may pan out in a valuable way. But 
I think he was foolish putting so many eggs in one 
basket. He's sold Duke to Baubein." 

"He cared more for Chita." 

"There's big money in Duke. He's a splendid 
trotter." 

I tried to eat. Father was hungry, and just as the 
pie came on Ben entered and had some dessert, and 
there followed a long talk with father, who then settled 
himself in an easy chair for his nap. 

Had Dan really told the truth? Was Polly to be 
his companion? How would it come out? At all 
events, I would keep my own counsel. 

It had been a pretty warm day until about five, when 
some suspicious clouds went scurrying across the sky, 
and a blast of wind seemed to come off of an iceberg. 



 

We shut down the windows, the storm rushed up so 
quickly. Then the wind fell. In a little while there 
was such a peculiar light, not sunset, it obscured the 
sun even, a strange yellow glow over everything, dark 
ening and yet not making dark. The air was now 
very still. Men went hurrying homeward. 

"There'll be a big storm," one and another said when 
they came within hearing. I thought of the two out 
on the lake and how Dan disliked the water. 

There had been a curious talk about the end of the 
world coming. Jolette was afraid, and up in her room 
prayed mightily. 

"It is strange," father said over and over again, and 
he watched me closely. 

After a while it grew paler and that gave everything 
an unearthly glow. Yet it looked beautiful. It was 
nothing like sunset, I had never seen such a light be 
fore. The distant cornfields were simply magnificent. 
Trees looked as if they were painted on a background, 
every branch and twig were so distinctly outlined. 

Then by slow degrees it faded, growing into even 
ing gradually. There had been no sunset, but night 
was coming on quietly and the sky was a smooth gray. 

Ben rushed in breathless. 

"Hasn't it all been queer?" he exclaimed. "Mother 
was sure the end of the world was here. They've been 
preaching it a good deal to the eastward. Norme in 
sisted I should come up and stay all night with you." 
How good the old name sounded ! "He could manage 
mother better. I never saw her so frightened. Were 
you?" 





"Well the world is going to be destroyed by fire, 
but it wasn't hot enough to melt the fervent elements, 
so I thought we were safe," replied father jocosely. 

Then they began about the prophecies, and how in 
the first century they thought Christ would come the 
second time before St. John died. Father had been 
quite a great Bible reader of late years. We spoke of 
Dan, too, and hoped he would reach his destination 
safely. Evidently Ben nor mother had any idea he had 
gone to stay, or that there was anything wrong. I 
almost persuaded myself I had dreamed that cruel, 
brutal talk. It had been interspersed with not a little 
profanity. I hated swearing. 

We went to bed at length. I felt so sore and sad 
then, with all my life in ruins, that I cried softly on my 
pillow. A deserted wife! And when the story came 
out, how hard all the gossip would be to hear ! 

The Yankee clock in the hall rattled off its hours. 
It always struck as if it might lose a second of time 
between the strokes. Twelve ! The eerie hour. What 
if a ghost came to me ! Oh, what was that ! 

An awful roar of something coming nearer and 
nearer and then breaking into a thousand shrieks. I 
sprang out of bed and screamed. 

Father called to me, "Come in here, Ruth," and I 
ran, frightened almost out of life. 

I suppose there had been such tempests before. I 
know there have been since. Ben came in wrapped in 
a blanket and lighted some candles, then sat on the 
foot of father's bed. It was something terrific. The 
house rocked, we heard the trees crash down, the cries 



 

of the animals and the frightened poultry, and that 
mighty roar and swirl as if the destruction of the world 
had begun. We were so near the lake that we guessed 
what an ocean tempest must be with the great waves 
pounding up, fighting each other like angry armies. 

Then it began to rain. A great fierce deluge, this 
way and that, whirling, beating, changing about, 
thrashing, as if it meant to crush out life, the world, 
everything. Oh, what torrents! It stamped on the 
ground in its rage. It beat on the roof as if it meant to 
crush it in, and was all the uglier for being foiled. 

I snuggled up to father and pressed my cheek against 
his. His arm was around me. We two, henceforth, 
always. And what of the other two? I felt the boat 
must have put in somewhere. It should have been a 
magnificent night with the moon just past the full. I 
thought of the ride on Chita in the harvest moonlight. 
Other tender remembrances came back to me, and 
from the depths of my soul I cried to God for their 
safety, cried mightily, as if my own soul was at stake. 

It was two before the storm began to abate at all, 
then it rained steadily, and the wind raged, but not so 
fiercely, the lake roared like a great booming cannon, 
but the house had stood the shock and we were safe. 
It had been so good to have Ben. Yet it was curious 
we had none of us once spoken Dan's name, though I 
think it was deep in our hearts. 

The skies were still thick in the morning, as if layer 
after layer had to roll away before it could clear. The 
wind had mostly ceased, and the rain held up now and 
then and came in gusts again. 




Oh, the destruction that greeted us ! The lake had 
been loosed it seemed and swept over everything. 
Streets were rivers, some houses had been carried off 
their foundations. We were on higher ground, but 
there was only a short distance between us and this 
great sea the wind had stirred up. 

About ten the clouds began to lift a little and patches 
of blue struggled here and there and were submerged 
again. Poor Jolette had gone almost crazy and really 
had not wit enough left to get breakfast. Ben and I 
helped, but all the life had been wrenched out of me. 
One of the outbuildings had gone over, but the barn 
and stable and hennery were intact. 

By noon Norman came over, waded over, for he was 
mud up to his knees. The instant I looked into his 
kindly, pitying eyes I felt he shared my secret. I did 
not dare give him a second glance, for I knew I should 
cry out in anguish. 

After an hour or two the sun came out, as if quite 
ashamed of the destruction the wretched myrmidons 
of storm had wrought. And we heard how wharves 
and storehouses had been submerged, vessels torn 
away and wrecked, swept down to the end of the lake, 
and such destruction as had never come upon us before, 
as there had not been so much to destroy. 

It was several days before the damage could really 
be estimated. The waters subsided, the lake took her 
mud and ooze and overflow. The sun shone as if it 
was glad to help dry up and restore, and the blue skies 
smiled, the winds seemed as if led by a child. 

Some of the corn had been cut and stacked, and the 



 

rest, though beaten down, was so fully ripened there 
would not be a great loss. Most of the grains had 
been cut and housed. 

"I declare, Gaynor, you do have the best luck of any 
one I know," said a neighbor. 

It seemed so. Father was really a rich man, but 
most of it had come through thrift. 

I felt weak and miserable. I was holding my breath 
for some blow that would surely strike, and when I 
looked in any one's face I felt as if I must scream. 

Norman came up on the porch one afternoon. I 
was walking slowly downstairs, and halted in the hall. 
I did not hear what father asked, but Norman an 
swered : 

"Yes. They have heard. The Prairie Bird ran 
ashore on some rocks that stove a hole in her, and then 
was blown out to sea again. Only a few were saved, 
two or three of the sailors. But that isn't the worst 
news to face. It is going all over now. Poor Ruth! 
If she might never know! For how can I tell it? 
My own brother, too !" 

I stepped out. I suppose I must have looked like a 
ghost. Norman stretched out his arms, but I tottered 
to father. 

"I know," I said, trying to steady my voice that 
seemed blown about by the stress of emotion. "Dan 
told me that day. They loved each other and went 
away together." 

"And were found dead, locked in each other's arms." 

I fell over into father's chair. That was the last 
I knew for a long while. 



CHAPTER XIX 

HOW NORMAN CAME HOME 

THOSE years abroad had been very precious years to 
me in spite of the great disappointment of not return 
ing home at the promised time. I found Mr. Le Moyne 
a charming gentleman, and was not made in any de 
gree a servant, but treated like a relative. I knew 
afterward that he took a great fancy to me from what 
Mr. Harris said, and, as he told me, "he liked my face." 
I kept accounts for him, wrote letters, read aloud, 
studied and wrote to the Little Girl and my mother as
