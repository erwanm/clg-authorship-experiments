Bessie was like a bird let loose. She haunted 
shops and stores ; she looked covetously at the 
tempting array in windows ; she shopped with 
a half-hesitation, all her desires seemed so extrava 
gant. They took lunch in a stylish restaurant, and 




Bessie ordered delicacies that had been out of 
reach in her girlhood. 

Quite late in the afternoon, he mentioned Miss 
Rolfe again. 

" I am too tired to go," Bessie said brusquely. 
She caught the look of disappointment on his face, 
and felt she had been ungracious. 

" Suppose you put me in a car, and you go," she 
proposed, in a softer tone. " Then you can tell if 
she really cares to see me. You know she only 
took me on sufferance. And I'll get rested up for 
to-night. I am tired, truly." 

" Oh, we can wait until to-morrow." 

But the "to-morrow" was busy enough when it 
merged in to-day. Bessie had a slight headache 
and would not go out in the afternoon. She was 
still lying on the bed when Mrs. Lowndes' card 
was sent up to her. 

" My dear child ! " cried Mrs. Lowndes, as Bessie 
entered the reception room. " I just received your 
note this morning, and I had a dozen engagements. 
I've fulfilled part of them, and then I ran off. I 
was so glad to hear that you were here. I never 
reached the city myself until December, but a friend 
had taken a double suite of rooms, and I am quite 
settled. I meant to write to you as soon as I could 
get through with the press of other matters. I 
hope you have come for a good long stay ! And 



 

you saw Violet ? She's made a great hit this 
winter. You look charming. You must come to 
me to-morrow. It is my afternoon. And now tell 
me what you have been doing all the autumn." 

" Growing more and more stupid, and hating 
Westhorpe," returned Bessie, sharply. 

" And the mills and things ? " 

" The mill is in running order. There are hosts 
of new people, such as they are. But there's noth 
ing to amuse one. I think some day I shall run 
away." 

" You are a naughty child. And your husband ? " 

" He has found time to be quite devoted," 
Bessie answered, with a laugh. 

That was a better aspect of affairs, Mrs. Lowndes 
thought. She had been a little startled at the half- 
incoherent note. She was not at all ready to take 
the onus of any woman's ill-considered step. So 
now they could talk quite at their ease. Mrs. 
Lowndes had been here and there. She had met 
some very entertaining people ; women of course. 
Women were coming to the fore all the time. 
There was so much work to be done, and this 
work had so many amusing phases, it did not bore 
Bessie in the least There was a woman's meeting 
at eleven to-morrow in Mrs. Broderick's parlor. 
Bessie would like the fun, she was sure, the ideas 
were so various and striking. "Then you must 



 

come home with me and have luncheon and a rest 
I have sent out invitations for four Fridays, two for 
this month and two late in January ; so it is fortu 
nate you came this week." 

They talked on until Mrs. Lowndes bethought 
herself of another engagement. Palmer had made 
some business calls, balancing his desire to see 
Thirza with a half-defined fear of the propriety of 
calling on her alone. Bessie, he felt, had no real 
desire to go. He halted a few moments before the 
neat but unpretentious apartment house. A lot of 
women trying to make a home had seemed a rather 
ridiculous idea to him, as to John Kent. 

He summoned courage presently and threaded 
his way through halls and stairs, and tapped 
lightly at her door. Thirza opened it herself, so 
there was no chance to retreat. 

" Oh ! " with a flush of pleasure illuminating her 
face, "my dear old friend, how welcome you are! 
It is indeed a treat to see some one from Wes- 
thorpe. And here is a surprise as well. We 
were talking of you not five minutes ago." 

Palmer flushed, but still held her hand uncon 
sciously, as they nearly crossed the room. A tall, 
beautiful woman rose ; yes, she was that now. 
The girlish hauteur had been toned to a sweet 
and gracious dignity. There was a softened light 
in her eyes that bespoke womanly tenderness, and 



 

the curves about the mouth and chin were finer, 
nobler. She smiled with charming friendliness. 

" Miss Otis ! This is an unexpected pleasure. 
I hardly had the courage to present myself to 
Miss Rolfe, lest my rural aspect and demeanor 
might be quite humiliating to my friends." 

Thirza laughed softly, and glanced him over. 

No, he had not degenerated ; his marriage had 
not been a bad thing for him, she fancied at the 
moment. 

" Sit down and tell me all about Westhorpe. 
And Mrs. Palmer " 

" I left her at the hotel, too tired for another 
step. She is on her native heath pavement, 
in this instance," and he smiled. " We were 
prevented in calling yesterday, but she insisted 
I should delay it no longer. And as my time is 
a good deal taken up with business " 

" Surely you need not apologize for remember 
ing me, the friend of a lifetime," returned Thirza, 
with an aspect as cordial as her words. " I con 
fess my delight at once. Indeed, you have occu 
pied a good share of my thoughts, I must admit, 
I have heard such conflicting accounts of you. At 
first you were bent on ruining Westhorpe with 
your railroad and improvements. And now the 
railroad connection is what the town has needed 
for years, and as the mill and the businesses of vari- 



 

ous kinds are advancing the material interests of 
the place, I think you are quite forgiven. Or is 
it the ingratitude of towns ? " 

" You would hardly know us. You missed us 
altogether this summer." 

" Yes ; I had a certain inward assurance that you 
would not need me. And Westhorpe was unusu 
ally gay, my sister wrote. Are you in the con 
spiracy of the new hotel ? " 

" Oh, no. I am not the head and front of all 
offending. Elm Avenue has been straightened 
and made wider at the upper end, and here the 
new hotel is to stand. We are waking out of our 
Rip Van Winkle nap." 

" Are you quite sure you will not spoil the 
beautiful old town? We ought to have some 
places full of dreamy comfort when life presses 
too hard." 

" The old part will be left undisturbed. The 
new part will stretch out on the opposite side of 
the river. Yes, I should be sorry to see any 
great change in those streets that have grown up 
with the sacredness of homes and memories cen 
turies old. But the world forges on, and we must 
join the procession or drop into stupor and decay. 
There will be enough left for you to recognize the 
place, unless you should stay away too long. But 
I half envied you your journey on the other side 



 

of our great continent. It is one of the hopes in 
store for me. You and Miss Otis must have 
enjoyed it to the full." 

They talked it over, Helen Otis taking her 
share in the conversation. Palmer was keenly 
interested, and Helen was surprised at the knowl 
edge he displayed, that must have been gleaned 
from close reading. Then they came back to 
Westhorpe, and he was amazed when Thirza 
sprang up lightly and declared they had lost 
count of time and were in evening twilight. 

The room looked charmingly comfortable in the 
soft glow of the shaded lamp, and the burner over 
head that sent its gleams farther around. Thirza 
had been at work on a water-color that stood on 
the easel. Palmer glanced about. What gave it 
the indescribable charm ? The soft coloring, the 
air of ease and restfulness, a bowl of deep red 
roses on a small table, and a straggling cluster of 
golden-hearted Marguerites with all their feathery 
green growing out of a slim tall vase, suggested 
summer. A woman's room, he said to himself, 
yet there were women and women. The restful 
aspect touched him. Was it the ideal he some 
times dreamed over ? 

" I have stayed unconscionably," he exclaimed, 
" and even now, I hate to go away ; there are so 
many things left unsaid." 



 



"But you will come again," rejoined Thirza, 
cordially, "and bring Mrs. Palmer. I would call 
if I knew when to find her in." 

"Which is, of course, extremely uncertain. 
Yes, I shall be glad to bring her." 

He went out amid the hurrying throng, with the 
picture of the room and the two women in their 
noble sweetness before his eyes. It had hardly 
dimmed when he entered his apartment at the 
hotel. Bessie was putting the finishing touches 
to her dinner toilette. 

" Oh, I have so much to tell you ! " she cried, 
with joyous animation. " Mrs. Lowndes has been 
here. You remember she was at Westhorpe last 
summer ? And I am going out with her all day 
to-morrow. It's her reception in the afternoon, 
and Saturday she is to take me to a matinee, and 
she thinks I can see Violet Fair afterward." 

So she was very little interested in Thirza. 
Mrs. Lowndes knew two women who had ex 
hibited at the Academy, and had casually met Miss 
Otis. 

What charm lured him again to Thirza Rolfe's 
the next afternoon ? He had a presentiment she 
would be out ; but she was not only in, to his great 
gratification, but alone. 

They took up the incidents that had been so event 
ful to him, Aunt Hannah's death and his mar- 



riage. He touched lightly on the latter event, but 
Thirza was startled by a sudden knowledge that for 
a moment overwhelmed her. Certainly Bessie had 
not been the election of his heart. Thirza won 
dered if he had developed any ? She recalled the 
almost disagreement she and Helen Otis had 
fallen into at the first tidings of his marriage. He 
said nothing about his domestic affairs, but he 
was eagerly descriptive concerning the improve 
ments. 

" We were deeply disappointed last summer at 
not seeing you. Bessie had her own pony and 
phaeton, though so many of the real Westhorpe 
people were away. Still it was quite gay," and he 
sighed a little, in a manner that touched her to the 
quick. 

" I went away on quite a short notice, and it 
had a profitable side as well. One of my com 
peers," smiling a little, " had an excellent business 
offer and wanted me to take the illustrations. 
Then Miss Esther Brooke, who had been ailing 
some time, died. Helen was devoted to her and 
quite worn out. Mrs. Otis proposed that they 
should join us when we reached Lower California, 
and it was such a delightful summer." 

Her eyes were lustrous now with all the charm 
ing memories. 

" Yet I hate to have you give up Westhorpe," he 



said, with a lingering intonation that moved her 
keenly. 

"Oh, I shall not give it up altogether. Do 
not the loves of early youth come back in old age ? 
When I want to retire from the active, busy world, 
I may buy me a cottage in its sylvan shades 
that is, if there are any left," glancing up archly. 

" I for one do not want to wait for old age. 
Though one could hardly connect you with age," 
and he looked admiringly at the proud eager 
woman. Why had he not loved her? Why, in 
deed, except that he had fancied she would some 
day belong to Bernard Ward ? " You and Miss 
Otis are splendid examples of womankind. Has 
she found any " He paused and flushed, but 
Thirza knew the word was not lovers. 

" I was so afraid at first that she would be rest 
less and dissatisfied and make some mistake in 
her eagerness to have a life of her very own, to 
make amends for the disappointment about her 
father. But Mrs. Otis is one of the lovely wise 
women who had to care for herself so many years, 
that home and love came to have a sacredness, 
a desirableness. I suppose Mr. Otis chose her 
because he loved her, and he is very much in love," 
laughing with soft approval ; " but if he had been 
looking for a friend for his daughter, he could not 
have made a wiser selection. Mrs. Otis insisted 





that Miss Brooke should come to them for a while, 
and now they are one family, one charming fam 
ily. It is my ideal home. I want you to see it 
and them. Miss Brooke will be very glad to meet 
you and Bessie." 

"You have not gone clear over " Palmer 
paused and gave a half-embarrassed smile. " Mrs. 
Kent is much worried about you," changing the 
sentence suddenly, but not its trend. 

Thirza flushed. " Clear over on the woman ques 
tion," she appended. " It has a great many sides, 
a great many issues, and is too large to be settled 
in one generation, perhaps. The part that has 
interested me is a woman's right to be respected 
in earning her living along the lines for which she 
is best fitted. I dare say I could spend my time 
between Clara and Seth, and make myself womanly 
useful. My little income would have clothed me. 
Would I have done justice to myself ? God gave 
me a certain talent, and I am using it, perhaps 
to quite as good a purpose as if I had .made a 
hasty, mistaken marriage." 

" But are you going to forswear matrimony ? 
Thirza, just such women as you are needed to 
prove to the world what a perfect, intelligent, well- 
administered home might be like." 

" If I should marry, it will be intelligently." She 
blushed, and half-smiled. " You admit then that 





I have not lost the art of home-making. Last year 
there were three women of us here, happy, busy, 
not despising social life, sometimes a little frivo 
lous perhaps, at others deep in interests outside of 
our own lives, learning all the time how much real 
work there was in the world, sympathizing with 
our struggling sisters, helping them to a truer 
standpoint, earning our own living, and realizing 
better, perhaps, what living costs. I shall have 
to admit that it has not been a bar to matrimony, 
for one of our number has succumbed to its bland 
ishments. She and her husband are splendidly 
mated and have gone on their wedding journey 
around the world. That she is not a helpless, friv 
olous being will prove no detriment, I think. Yet 
at eighteen she was tempted to marry a rather brill 
iant young man, who has turned out both a drunk 
ard and a thief. Would a life with him have made 
her more heroic ? When a woman feels she need 
not depend upon matrimony as the only resource, 
there will be a better race of women and wives." 

"You haven't gone very far in the new doc 
trines," he commented drily, to keep from crying 
out at the truth of her words. 

She gave an amused smile, unconscious of the 
turmoil within the man, and said lightly : 

" Oh, I go to suffrage meetings now and then. 
I even listen to the tremendous charges made 



 

against the tyrant man. But if women gladly 
accept the chain and spend their best energies in 
pampering the man they have set over them, I do 
not see that they have a just cause for complaint. 
Or if a woman accepts a home and support, 
merely, surely she has some duties on her side." 

" It is you splendid women who keep out of 
matrimony," he said, as if impelled. 

He rose abruptly. He would like to ask some 
advice of this clear-eyed, large-hearted woman. 
He had been used to a small round where women 
were concerned. Could this great mistake of his 
life be mended ? 



CHAPTER XII 

THE PITY OF IT 

THE fortnight passed rapidly. Even Palmer 
dreaded to snap the fascinating charm. He had 
prevailed upon Bessie to come to a luncheon at 
Miss Rolfe's, but she was so engrossed with Mrs. 
Lowndes' circle that she was not specially inter 
ested. Then he had gone with Thirza to call upon 
Miss Brooke and met Mrs. Otis, whom he found a 
very charming woman. Miss Otis and Thirza had 
called upon Mrs. Palmer. Bessie, with her natural 
adaptiveness, had attained a certain elegance in 
this brief while. 

Neither of the girls discussed the marriage. 
Thirza felt she had really underrated Palmer. Or 
had he, like herself, been roused to make the best 
of his abilities ? That was quite possible. Woman 
like, she had considered only Bessie's welfare in the 
marriage, and she knew now it was one more of 
the great mistakes of life, for Bessie was simply 
frivolous and selfish. She showed it too plainly. 

He came in, the morning of his departure, 
rather worried and uncertain, she thought. 



 

" Bessie has not finished her visit," he said, in a 
somewhat troubled tone. " Mrs. Lowndes insists 
upon her spending a fortnight with her. Thirza 
if you would call a time or two ! The holidays 
will be much gayer here, and Bessie was brought 
up in the city, you know. It seems really cruel 
to refuse her." 

" I will do whatever I can," Thirza answered, 
startled, and intuitively apprehending the mistake. 

" I am compelled to return. I have stayed 
longer than I ought, and I shall be very much 
engrossed with some matters at home. But Wes- 
thorpe is dull and lonesome for her." 

" Even I have been insensible to its charms," 
she returned lightly, by way of comfort. 

He had meant to ask another favor, that she 
would write a note or two ; but it seemed like a 
watch set upon his wife, and he did trust her. 
No, it was not possible to propose such a thing. 

" I have many things to thank you for," he said 
in a strained, hurried tone, with his farewell. Yet 
he wished more than once he had exerted a hus 
band's authority and brought Bessie home. He 
did not quite approve of Mrs. Lowndes, and her 
" set " was not at all select. Perhaps it could not 
be, taking in lecturers, musicians, literary aspirants, 
and theatrical people. 

One or two brief notes came from Bessie, in 



 

which she said Thirza had called and she had 
gone to tea and a little musicale at Miss Rolfe's, 
who had quite signalized herself with some Christ 
mas work. A delay and then an announcement 
that her stay would be prolonged another week. 

Palmer gave Bessie the full week's grace, and 
then went to the city for her, carrying her off 
to a hotel, where they had a stormy time indeed. 
Bessie had been listening to more than one dis 
cussion on the tyranny of husbands, and had 
formulated some very decided opinions. But she 
found Palmer was the master in that he was the 
moneyed partner to the contract. She had been 
quite lavish, and she knew that money was the 
important part of life her life. 

" If she had some of her own," she kept 
thinking in sullen silence during the homeward 
journey. Oh, why had she been so eager to 
marry Palmer? 

How wretchedly plain the house looked after 
all the light and glare and gay furnishings ! It 
was cold and stormy for a week, and Bessie 
refused all overtures of comfort and tenderness. 
Her only consolation was writing long letters 
to Mrs. Lowndes, which she mailed herself, 
with a half-guilty conscience, for she felt her 
trials were largely exaggerated. Day and night 
she dreamed of freedom. Women were often 



 

divorced. Why should Roy care to keep her, 
when she had said she hated him ? Once she 
had accused him of compelling her to marry him. 

He looked straight into her eyes, that had 
been so pleading that unfortunate night. 

" Bessie, you know that is not true, and we 
have sadly realized that Aunt Hannah's judg 
ment would have been much wiser for both of 
us." 

Bessie shuddered. Why must he recall that 
horrible time ! What else could she have done, 
unless he had been a brother and generous 
enough to let her try life for herself? For she 
knew now she might be a very fair success on 
the stage. It was not genius alone or hard 
work that won the plaudits. Ah, how enticing 
the life looked ! And if a woman had a right 
to live out the best of her aims and beliefs ; 
if, having made a mistake, she could in some 
manner cast it behind her and start afresh 
Ah, how tempting that shallow approval ap 
peared ! 

She tried to discuss the possibility with her 
husband. She used the arguments that had 
seemed so plausible to her, so convincing. This 
was not the life for her. She could not make 
him happy. Why, then, should she be con 
demned to make him miserable ? 



 

" But you have not really tried, Bessie, child ; 
do make one earnest effort. Will you not take 
a little interest in our home and make it cheer 
ful ? In the spring, we will furnish anew, and 
if there are any alterations you would like " 

" I hate the loneliness out here. I hate house 
keeping ! " she said vehemently. 

" But you don't keep house." They had 
two servants, and Bessie always took break 
fast in her own room. Since her return, she 
had evinced no real interest. " It wouldn't be 
so bad boarding at one of the hotels. The lone 
liness kills me. I never was fitted for such a life. 
I knew I should be wretched the moment I entered 
this place. Oh, why did fate send me here ! " 

He remembered the soft arms that had been 
wound around his neck that first night, and the 
cheek that had brushed against his. She seemed 
so sweet and delicate in her helplessness. And 
she was longing to try the hard, hurrying, heart 
less world, where one misstep ruined a life ! No, 
he could not let her go. Whether for good or ill 
he had taken her into his keeping, and he was an 
swerable for her. If he could not make her happy, 
she would at least be safe. 

When she had exhausted her arguments, which 
were something of a shock to him, she fell into a 
dreary, sullen silence. Each day her chain grew 



 

heavier. Why had she not a right to snap it ? 
Ah, if she had some money of her very own ! 

The spring came on, and, to Palmer, Westhorpe 
had never seemed so lovely, nor the old farm-house 
so dear. Yet he wondered if he might not make 
the concession for Bessie's sake. The house needed 
painting and repairing, and if they went to a hotel 
for a month, it would be pleasanter. His business 
interests were increasing, and he was often en 
gaged in the evening. Bessie would have some 
entertainment. 

She rather brightened at the proposal. Then a 
letter came from Mrs. Lowndes that stirred the 
passionate longings of her nature. Violet Fair 
had married her manager. They were forming a 
company to visit the principal Western cities, and 
Miss Fair's experience enabled her to select those 
she was quite sure would be a success. 

"If you were only single and really wanted to 
take up the life, it would be a chance out of a 
thousand for you," wrote Mrs. Lowndes. "Violet 
was so impressed with your grace, ease, and adapt 
ability. She wouldn't give you any encourage 
ment, because you were married, but she said only 
yesterday, ' I wish that pretty Mrs. Palmer wanted 
to try for a season. What a pity she is not a 
widow ! I'd put her in the way of success at once.' 
Your forte is the stage, and it is a shame to be 




buried alive in a humdrum country town. I think 
of going to California with a party who are to take 
up a crusade in behalf of women. It amuses me, 
and one likes fresh pastures now and then. So I 
cannot come to you, but you might come to me 
for a while." 

A chance for her ! The words haunted her 
night and day. That Violet Fair should admit 
that she might be a success ! A feeling of elation 
thrilled through every nerve. She danced about 
the room with a delirious sort of joy, as if she al 
ready saw herself on the stage. Some one had 
said her dancing was a perfect poem. Did not 
the woman who could write a poem rush into 
print, long for publicity ? 

" Bessie," Palmer said that noon, " I find I must 
go away for several days. I have had an offer of 
a large lot of lumber that I would be very fortunate 
to get. I shall go as far as Detroit, as there is a 
little business there I must settle in person. Sup 
pose you join me on a week's holiday," and he 
smiled persuasively. " I should not like to leave 
you here alone, and there would be the same objec 
tion to the hotel." 

Bessie stood quite transfixed. " I should not go 
to the hotel alone," she answered rather sharply, 
from an excess of emotion, hard to control. If she 
might go to New York instead ! 



 

"I must start. to-morrow," he continued. "It is 
a short notice " 

" And I should be alone a good deal, then. A 
business tour isn't very diverting to a woman." 

" I should take some leisure. I thought you 
were longing for a change." He felt hurt at her 
objections. 

" I'll consider," she returned, with cold indiffer 
ence. 

If he could only understand what would make 
her happy. She puzzled him sorely. He had 
need of a good deal of patience. 

Bessie sat in a study all the afternoon. More 
than once she had contemplated the step that 
would ensure a separation. Why should she 
spend her years with an uncongenial man ? 
He had met every argument with the stub 
born fact of duty. They were married. They 
must go on and find the true level. If she 
went away, if she made all her plans before he 
could possibly become aware of them, and if she 
refused utterly to share his life henceforth ! 
The adventurous side of the matter appealed to 
her. 

When he came home to supper, rather late, she 
was wrapped up in a shawl, lying on the bed. 
She did not want to talk, but just think over her 
daring plot. And the best of it would be that if 



Q 

she was unsuccessful, she could return without 
confessing the real object of her journey. 

" No," she said pettishly, in answer to his in 
quiries, " she was not ill. She did not even have 
a headache. She simply wanted to be alone and 
quiet." 

He was used to her whims and changes, and he 
was not surprised when she told him the next 
morning she had decided not to accompany him. 
She would get along very well. There were 
enough people in the house for safety. 

So Royal Palmer went his way, rather dis 
pirited, it must be confessed. He could under 
stand a woman like Thirza ; or, were women dif 
ferent when one came to see them daily ? But he 
would not torment her by unanswerable questions. 
He gave her a tender good-bye kiss. 

Palmer was delayed a little. He had received 
but one note from Bessie ; still he recalled the fact 
that she had not been much of a correspondent 
while in New York. From the station he went 
over to the post-office, and one letter in his mail 
startled him. He knew Bessie's girlish, irregular 
hand at a glance. The post-mark told him another 
fact. Still, he did not open it until he returned home. 

"There's a pile of letters on your table," an 
nounced Jane, after the first greeting. " One from 
Mrs. Palmer." 



 

" Yes, and another came to-day." Then he passed 
through to the sitting-room. The feeling was strong 
upon him that Bessie had decided her own destiny. 
He opened several of the business letters first, and 
then held hers for many minutes in his fingers. 

She had decided. There was some illogical 
reasoning, but she admitted frankly that she was 
miserable and dissatisfied, that she knew now she 
had never loved him, and that she never could be 
happy in Westhorpe. She had seen the manager 
of a theatrical company, and had been accepted, 
and no argument or persuasions would induce her 
to give up her plans. She begged him not to 
make any effort to see her, and said they were 
soon to go away, that her first appearance would 
be made in distant cities, but she was not afraid of 
failure. He could take any course he chose in 
regard to the future. 

No tenderness, no regret, no lingering touch of 
sympathy ! He bowed his head that she could be 
so heartless. 

The second note announced they were to leave 
on the tenth. Why, that was to-day ! She was 
flying from the infelicities of her short life, think 
ing every mile between them was an augury of 
safety. A sad half-smile crossed his face. Now 
that the step was taken, further opposition would 
be useless. He accepted the grim facts. 



When he went out to supper, he simply said : 
" Mrs. Palmer will not be home this week." There 
was no one save the farm hands with them now, 
so he ate his meal in silence and spent the evening 
as he had spent so many, immersed in business. 
But the house seemed strangely solitary. In a 
certain fashion he found he had been very fond of 
her, that she was a large interest in his life. 

That Mrs. Palmer should be away several weeks 
created no comment. That she should go West 
with some friends was no surprise, though after 
a while there came some furtive whispers. But 
only one person knew the truth, and that was 
Bernard Ward. Royal had gone to him for com 
fort in his perplexity. 

" I should simply do nothing," said Ward. "She 
is not worthy of any man's solicitude. I can't 
understand how you came to marry her when you 
had known a woman like Thirza Rolfe." 

"But I never thought " and he stared at 
Ward with perplexed astonishment. 

" Oh, she would not have married either of us," 
bitterly. " But having known her it seems as if 
one must despise weakness and frivolity ever after 
ward. Such women mean to hold themselves 
regally above ordinary men. Either we give up 
our dreams of home and happiness, or make a 
wreck with some lesser prize and find it delusion." 



 

" You cared for her ; I always knew that. 
There was nothing between us but ordinary 
friendship, now high and fine, but under no 
circumstances would it ripen into love. Surely 
you did not allow such a fancy to mar any 
dream. Why, if you loved her " 

A tender, heartfelt light shone in Palmer's 
eyes. Always he had half suspected Ward. 

" If I loved her, she would walk coolly 
over it. Women's demands increase with their 
power. Perhaps we have had it too long our 
own way. But in the- main it was not altogether 
a bad way. It made some happy homes. And 
in the years to come we shall all miss the 
influence, I am thinking. When women come 
to live for the world and enjoy the turmoil and 
strife instead of the hidden sweetness of love 
and home, marriage is at a discount." 

" You are unjust to her. If you could see 
her in that pretty room with her work about 
her, you would feel the womanliness of the 
picture. Surely, Ward, you can't object to any 
woman living up to the truest and noblest 
aims ? " 

" Aims of self-sufficiency. They want to stand 
quite alone. They are ashamed to accept the 
common lot of mankind, an ordinary man, an 
ordinary love. If the ideals of men of half a 



 

century ago were foolish, weak, and lackadaisi 
cal, still there were some noble sweethearts and 
wives and mothers. But their ideal man must 
have the virtues of the angel Gabriel, and 
stand at the topmost round of everything. We 
cannot all be at the top, we may as well accept 
the fact. So we who are pot consumed by mis 
called ambition, cannot enter the lists for the 
modern woman who is able to make her home 
to her own liking." 

"You are unduly bitter, Ward. And if you 
cared for Thirza ' 

" Cared for her ! " Ward interrupted vehe 
mently. " I loved her six years ago, when I came 
here fresh from college with a young fellow's 
dreams of distinguishing himself. But you learn 
there is more talent in the world than you had 
suspected, and each man is striving for the 
same thing. Then came her legacy, her year 
at school, her knowledge of her own powers, 
her genius, if you will. When she was here 
not quite two years ago, her very advance iri 
everything startled me. I felt as if I had been 
wasting my life, vegetating. Yet I had done my 
duty thoroughly here ; I had made some delight 
ful friends ; I had planned a lovely life with 
Thirza in it. But I half realized that she would 
disdain any ordinary round. I was dissatisfied. 



 

I spurred myself up to some new pursuits and 
took my remaining degree. Last year I had 
two good offers to go away. One was in a new 
Western college. The crude and undrilled life 
did not suit me; the refinements of Westhorpe 
did. The other was in a thriving Western city 
as well, but I had a presentiment Thirza would 
not accept that life any sooner than this. I did 
not like the hurry and strain. I want a little 
leisure to enjoy what I have. I cannot resolve 
to spend all my years in a restless struggle for 
the high places. Then, you have been so en 
grossed with your own affairs, that you may 
not have heard our academy is to be remodelled 
and made a superior educational centre. You 
business people over the river are not going 
to have it all your own way. The Miners are 
to build a new wing and give it a partial en 
dowment. After various wide experiences, Miss 
Miner has resolved to use her money in improv 
ing her native town." 

"Yes, I had heard something about it, and 
Colonel Miner's interest as well." 

"There are three elderly people with a good 
deal of money, and what is more to the point, 
some pride and public spirit, and I have accepted 
a position for the next three years and as much 
longer as I like. I might have more fame as a 



 

college professor elsewhere, but this suits me and 
gives me salary enough to indulge many of my 
wishes. I can have a home, leisure. I can sat 
isfy my whims," with a half-laugh, " read, study, 
even entertain friends," and he gave rather a 
sharp ending to his sentence. 

Palmer looked at him with a curious intentness. 
Was that summer, when the four of them had 
been so much together, a hundred years ago, or 
in some other life ? Bessie was a weak little 
shadow in it. He had known so little about him 
self then ; he had grown so much since. Affairs 
of greater moment had been presented to him, 
and he had found himself able to grasp them. 
Life seemed to stand expectant ; there was a fas 
cinating richness in it. It was not the estimate 
of the hurrying, bustling, artificial regulations 
without ; it was the two souls that might meet, 
blend, and work out between them a heavenly 
existence. 

-" Sometime I may go abroad, take a leisurely 
tour through Europe, not a mere six weeks' run. 
And, Roy, I must confess I was a little jealous in 
that old summer. I used to think Thirza might be 
won to something deeper than friendship with you." 

"We were always friends. Are some women 
especially formed for friendship ? " and his voice 
sank reflectively. 



 

" A woman not formed for love would be an 
anomaly, a monstrosity," Ward subjoined, with 
some bitterness. 

" I have known one intimately who is not 
formed for love, who never can be. Yet she has 
the winsome disguise, the apparent tenderness, 
and a certain seductive sweetness. Time dis 
proves many things, or perhaps it is experience." 

" And you care for Bessie?" Ward tried hard 
not to have the tone contemptuous. 

" I have the same tender pity for her that I had 
in the beginning. I am afraid I had no definite 
ideas about love, except faithfulness and kindli 
ness. So I have made a grave mistake. To 
bring her back in some compulsory fashion would
