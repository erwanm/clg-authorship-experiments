dipping it out with huge, long-handled ladles, and 
paused for a moment to stare at her. A strange vision 
was that lovely, childish face amid the rough, stalwart 
forms. 



 

She turned suddenly, and clasped her arms around 
Stephen Dane's neck. The soft, pinky flesh touched 
his lip and cheek in passing. She caught at a long, 
convulsive sigh, and he felt.how every pulse quivered as 
he turned away. 

" Were you frightened ? " he asked, when they had 
regained the doorway. 

"Not quite. Only I thought, if anybody ever let a 
little girl fall in " 

Both shivered ; she with her arms still around his 
neck soft, white arms, stirring all his manhood's 
blood. 

" What made you think of anything so terrible ? It 
could never, never happen." 

He drew her closer. 

"Mamma said Mr. Lawton might let me fall. But 
you are stronger." 

He rejoiced in his strength at that moment ; but he 
said, with a rather grim smile, 

"I am not one of your fine gentlemen." 

" I don't like Mr. Lawton," was her comment. 

She would like him by and by, when the years 
taught her the difference. And then Stephen Dane 
sighed. 

"Have you any little girls at home?" she asked, 
presently. 

"No." 

" What makes you look so sorry ? " 



 

She was peering into his eyes with her lustrous orbs 
swimming in lakes of liquid light. 

"Did I look sorry?" 

"Don't you like little girls?" She was following 
her own train of thought, and hardly noticed his 
question. 

"I like you." There was a strange, half-suppressed 
passion in his voice. 

" May I come down here sometimes ? Papa thinks 
me a bother. It's so lonesome at at home ! " There 
was a little break in her voice. "I haven't any one to 
play with, you know. And at Philadelphia there was 
Addie and Jane. It was so nice ! What's your 
name?" with a sudden impulse. 

" Stephen Dane." 

" Did you come from Denmark ? " 

" No ; " and he laughed. " Why ? " 

" The Danes do. I learned it in my Geography. 
I went to school when I lived with aunt Mary. I am 
going again some day. I like it." 

"What is your name?" he asked. 

"O, don't you know? Hope Vennard." 

"Hope." He repeated it musingly, tenderly. 

" Do you think it is pretty ? " she queried with a little 
timid flutter in her voice. 

"Yes. -Hope. Something to comfort one in wait- 
ing. An anchor sure and steadfast, if one only has 
something to hope for." 



 

"Now you are sorry again," she said. "I see it in 
your eyes." 

So quick to perceive ! He started. Who ever before 
had discovered any sorrow in his eyes ? And there was 
always a deep, underlying pain in his heart. Even 
this unreasoning sympathy was sweet. 

She bent suddenly and kissed him. Mr. Lawton 
teased a long while for these kisses, and her new 
mother apologized for her being such a " queer child." 
If either of them had seen this ! 

Stephen Dane stood transfixed. 

"I'm glad you let me look in that dreadful place, and 
held me so tight. Now put me down, please ; I must 
find mamma." 

He led her by the hand around outside the noisy 
room. When they saw the fluttering dresses, he let 
her go alone, but stood still to watch her. 

" Why, Hope, where have you been ? I thought 
your father had you. What a naughty little run- 
away ! " 

The voice was not cross, certainly; but it had a 
strand of pettishness. And Stephen, remembering Joe's 
words, wondered if Mrs. Vennard would be kind and 
tender with her. If not He ground his teeth at 
the very thought. He could fight to the bitterest death 
for this little girl. All his chivalrous feelings were 
aroused, and under the dust and rubbish of this coarse 



 

life there was some pure ore. She had kissed him, 
too. An innocent child's kiss a sort of angel's 
benison. If one day he could stand on a par with 
Hope Vennard ! In ten years she would be seventeen 
a woman. And what of him? 



 



ni. 

FIGHTING WITH FATE. 

JOE, sewing some tawdry finery by the flaring light 
of a tallow candle, struck hard and sharp against 
his vision of Hope Vennard. The low line of forehead, 
and untidy, tumbled black hair, with a stray end 
always falling from the comb ; the sun-browned com- 
plexion ; the sort of purely animal life in every feature ; 
the ill-fitting dress, and great red bow at the throat, 
much soiled and pinned awry, how different from the 
women down yonder ! He liked the taste and the re- 
finement best. If Joe could only understand I 

She was arranging some faded flowers on a bonnet. 
He glanced at those in the window. 

"Don't do it, Joe," he said, presently. "I'll get you 
a new one. White straw, with nice crisp buds, and 
leaves, and clean strings." 

" Will you ? " and Joe looked up delighted. 

"And if you'd wear flowers at your throat, Joe." 

"I can't, Stephen. They all ers fall apart, and wilt, 
and straggle down. I like 'em best in a saucer." 

"Always, Joe." 



"Always what?" and the girl's expression was one 
of dull amaze. 

"Don't mangle your words that's all." 

Joe pouted a little. "You're gettin' mighty per- 
tic'lar, Stephen." 

"There's no law against g's. And, Joe, if we were 
more careful ! We have fallen into such a slipshod 
habit of talking ! Why can we not make our lives and 
manners a little better ? " 

Joe considered a moment whether to be pleased or 
angry. She did not like to have her ways questioned 
or criticised. But then it was pleasant to know Stephen 
took an interest in her. He had been so reserved, so 
almost cross, of late. She said, unthinkingly, 

"You do care about me, Stephen?" 

" Yes ; I should be a brute if I didn't." 

His heart was tender to-night. But when he saw 
her evident pleasure, and the straggling flush that crept 
up in the dark cheeks, conscience pricked him a little. 
The old childish talk of husband and wife rushed over 
him. Many years ago, to be sure ; but he remembered, 
and Joe, with a woman's tenacious memory, was not 
likely to forget. Was she dreaming of any such thing ? 
For it could never be. 

So he sauntered out on the door-step, and gazed at 
the glittering stars. Up above there, so peacefid. 
Nothing to do but swing forever, amid seas of blue and 
fleecy white. Wafts it so very much better to be a man? 



 

Joe put away her work, and came up to him softly, 
passed her arm over his shoulder, and, bringing herself 
face to face, kissed him. Following out his first im- 
pulse, he pushed her from him not roughly, and yet 
it was a repulse. 

" I'm sure I don't know what to make of you, 
Stephen," she said, half crying. " You're so changed 
along o' goin' to the tavern and seein' that John Gil- 
bert. O my ! I forgot all about them g's. I can't be 
a lady, it wasn't born in me, and that's why you 
look down on me despise me ! " 

"No. Heaven knows I don't despise you, Joe. And 
I'd like to bring you up out of this swamp of vilenesa 
and darkness that we've ploughed along in all our lives. 
I loathe the very sight of it. I am changed. Maybe 
John Gilbert's had a hand in it, maybe not. I did 
take his rigmarole for gospel truth first ; but if it's so 
grand and fine, why doesn't he make his own life 
better? Why doesn't he go somewhere, if there is any 
such place, and be free and happy, following out the 
laws of truth and harmony ? What's the theory worth 
if there's to be no practice ? Better let men go on eat- 
ing and drinking, and grovelling like brutes, than stir 
them up to fierce tumults, and leave them there, chafing 
like angry tigers. So I'm about done with the non- 
sense. But there is something, Joe. Call it God, or 
Fate, or the Devil. And I shall never rest until I 
have a 'good hand-to-hand fight." 




"I wish you'd go to church, Stephen," Joe said. 
"Ministers know better than other folks." 

"Do they? I'm not so sure of that. They preach 
about content, and patience, and resignation ; but when 
a man begins to learn his own strength, when he feels 
his own wants and needs, what good will a crust of 
bread do? Can you feed a starving soul on it? 
There's an ache and an agony way down deep ; there's 
a capacity for something that struggles in bonds, and 
will be free ; and, when a man comes to this, he must 
fight it out. So, if I'm cross to you, Joe, blame it to 
the devil, that possesses me ! " 

His tone was deep and passionate, and Joe stared 
in affright. He was beyond her reach. His head was 
full of these new-fangled notions. Her narrow mind, 
bounded only by yesterday and to-morrow, could not 
comprehend the mighty conflict the man was going 
through. A little fondling and foolish caresses would 
have been more to her than his victory or defeat. And 
because she could not argue, she relapsed into sullen- 
ness the unfailing refuge of weak natures. Sally 
Fawcett, fat and rosy at forty, with her six unruly 
children, and Jake, " who never gave her a word when 
he was in liquor," was as high a type of happiness as 
Joe aspired to. For Jake was fond of his wife, a good- 
natured, rollicking fellow, who joked with every one. 
Don't blame Joe too severely. Her soul, restricted by 
its own nature and stinted experience, had only the 



 

wants its limited range allowed. Her fancies were 
neither broad nor varied. Yet she could have enjoyed 
happiness keenly if it had come to her. O, let us hope 
that God has some great joy in store for all the poor 
souls who have missed it here ! 

So Joe crept away to bed and cried a little. And 
Stephen stood under the silent stars, thinking, revolv- 
ing the tangled web that appeared to grow more intri- 
cate at every turn. 

The socialistic theories of Gilbert had not gained 
much ground with him. He was too clear-eyed. Men 
blinded by some passion or interest are more likely to 
take them up. Perhaps, too, he was gradually finding 
his way into the niche he fitted. Since his permanent 
change to the forge he had been happier. His mind 
seemed to assimilate with these mighty engines that 
grew beneath ponderous hammers and blazing fires. It 
was almost like creating a sentient being, when you put 
these rods, and pistons, and valves together, and inflated 
a steam chest from the huge boiler. That gave it life. 
Then it flew up and down, wheels revolved ; the force 
of a giant was in it. And Stephen smiled, seeing this. 
The Phalanstery, with its special affinities, its harmo- 
nies of beauty and nature, faded from his brain. His 
work was here. Men had spent their whole lives study- 
ing some trick of a machine or engine. And when Ad- 
ams, the foreman of this department, said, one day, 

"Dane, you have the head and the eye for an in- 




ventor. Some time I expect we shall hear from you. 
You see more in these things than a bit of hot or cold 
iron." A flush overspread Stephen Dane's swarthy face. 

So much was needed. How was he ever to accom- 
plish it ? Education first. And then he realized how 
ignorant he was. 

I think Adams understood the hunger of his soul. 
Occasionally they walked up the street together, talk- 
ing. And presently books were lent, a sort of free- 
masonry among certain men. Vennard, seeing the 
intimacy with his lynx-eye, took the foreman to task. 

"It won't do, Adams. I've seen it tried. These 
men must be made to know their places, and kept in 
them. Their business is to work. The less book- 
knowleflge and science such folks have, the better for 
them. They get above their station. Many a poor 
wretch has ruined himself by .thinking he had genius 
enough for some invention, when he might have lived 
a contented and comfortable life. Plenty of work and 
steady wages are all they need. I have them in pretty 
good order now, and they shall not be tampered with." 

Adams gave in, and was a little more cautious. He 
was no coward, but he knew he could not serve Dane 
by braving Mr. Vennard, and the man interested him 
singularly. 

June made Tregony a garden of fragrance and beauty. 
Roses everywhere. New life in tree and shrub, bird 
and bee. Wayside paths starred with daisies and but- 



 

terctips ; cool nooks entangled with clustering foliage 
and carpeted with rank mosses. The river with its 
murmurous rustle, the sky with its fleecy drifts every- 
where a profusion of summer richness and warmth. 
Stephen Dane felt it as he never had before. Emerging 
from the shadow of a gross, material life, he drank in 
these varied sensations with an almost childish delight. 
It was a new growing up to manhood. 

Now and then he caught a glimpse of Hope Vennard. 
The child looked bright and happy. Once she had 
nodded to him in her free, eager way, and been checked 
by her elegant mamma. He saw that, and bit his lip. 
And once she had been in the foundery. 

They had been trying some experiments with an 
engine. An improvement had been Attempted in the 
saving of steam, and several scientific men had come 
down from the city to witness the trial. All the morn- 
ing they had been deeply engrossed with it ; but alter 
a good dinner and rich wines they felt less energetic. 
So they had invited the ladies over, for Mrs. Ven- 
nard nearly always had a friend or two staying with 
her. Hope accompanied them. 

Stephen always remembered her as she looked on 
this day. Dressed purely in white, her curls fluttering 
like a changeful sea. So winsome, so radiant. And 
while the others talked, she stole to the open door 
through which she had caught a glimpse of Stephen. 

" May I come in ? " 




Stephen stood by a vice, filing some article that re- 
quired careful manipulations. 

" Yes," he answered, with a smile. 

She came and stood by him, plied him with a child's 
numerous and inconsequent questions, all of which he 
was delighted to answer, watching the lids droop over 
the eyes, the color come and go in her sweet face, and 
the curves of the small, scarlet mouth like a cleft 
strawberry, and as rich in fragrance. Could any thing 
so lovely belong to Thomas Vennard? He was think- 
ing of this when a harsh voice made them both start as 
if guilty of some sin. . ^ 

" Hope ! " 

The child's face turned a little pale. Vennard was 
a tyrant by nature. Even here he could not forego 
his authority always dear to him. 

"Dane, haven't you any more sense than to let a 
child bother round in that fashion? Hope, go to your 
mother." 

" She did not interrupt me," said Dane, in a sort of 
defiant apology. 

" Don't tell me ! A man's mind isn't on his work 
when he's fooling with anything. You've filed that 
too far." 

"It's just right." And Dane fitted it to the cog. 
He would have been more than human not to enjoy his 
triumph. 

Mr. Vennard was angry, and for .once helpless, as 




 

he could not think of a fitting retort. So he turned on 
his heel with a threatening frown. 

Adams came to Stephen's side, after they were all 
gone. 

"Vennard is bitterly disappointed at his non-suc- 
cess," he said, in a low tone. "I didn't know he 
counted so much on it. He wouldn't let any one put 
in a word, for he meant to claim the improvement." 

" What was wrong ? " 

" There was just no advantage at all. What he saved 
in steam he lost in revolutions. Misplaced economy, 
which, will not do for a steam-engine. You can starve 
a man better, eh, Dane?" 

"For a while, at least," returned Dane, grimly. 

" \iennard is making haste to be rich. If I had his 
chance, I'd take matters comfortably. He will have 
all old Ellicott's money. W T hat a fairy of a child that 
is ! She came in here ? " 

"Yes." Laconically. He did not want to hear any 
talk about Hope Vennard. 

"I think that can be done;" and Adams nodded 
his head towards the next room. " Will you look at it 
after six? Why, it would make a man's fortune ! " 

"Yes," Dane said, the words ringing through his 
ears. Not that he would ever make a fortune. But 
if he had a little money to start with, he and Adams, 
for instance, time to study and try experiments 
No, it could never be done ; and he sighed. 





The worst of life is to feel one's self wasted. And 
this sensation was growing up in Stephen Dane. Why 
didn't he have the chance other young men passed by 
with such indifference? A subtile flame was creeping 
through his brain, smouldering almost for want of 
proper nourishment, yet now and then bursting out into 
a fierce ray ; every time gaining a little, to be sure, but 
seeing no real escape. Ground down with poverty, 
ignorance, and yes, a sort of caste. Adams might 
see something worthier in him ; but then the man was 
almost as poor as himself, saving a little money, and 
trying experiments that failed continually. If Mr. 
Vennard would take one in hand ; and a cynical sneer 
for it was too bitter for a smile crossed Dane's face. 
Mr. Vennard believed common workmen had no busi- 
ness with ideas. Rude, brutish strength was all they 
needed. 

They did not dare linger very long over the engine. 
Neither would have confessed it, but both knew this 
sort of fraternizing did not meet Mr. Vennard's ap- 
proval. And every one had a fear of him, even if it 
was but half admitted in some secret corner of the brain. 

"Will Vennard try again, think?" Dane asked. 

"O, you may be sure of that, if some one doesn't 
come out first with an improvement. Dane," sharply, 
" if you have any revelations on the subject, sell 'em 
at a high figure. Don't let 'em be stolen. That thing is 
done too often." 



 

Neither of them had any ideas just then. They 
examined the steam-chest, the valves, the cut-off, 
and looking at each other with perplexed eyes, said, as 
many another had, 

" If it could be done ! " 

Stephen Dane made a sort of dogged mental vow 
that life should not all be wasted over yonder, at the 
forge. 

He passed out first. Adams paused to talk with the 
gate-keeper. But Dane's steps were arrested, ere he 
had gone thirty yards, by a group of men. 

" I say it's a cursed shame ! " and the speaker, purple 
with anger, was gesticulating savagely. " If Vennard 
stays here, Tregony 'll be turned into a pauper's den. 
What kin we do, I'd like to know? I've got an old 
bed-ridden mother, and five little cubs, one on 'em blind, 
and a month back at the store. What am I goin' to 
do? Where'll I get work? An' he brings in new 
men every day, an' if a man dares to stan' up for his 
rights, off he goes. 'Twan't so in Reardon's time, and 
old Ellicott never ground the soul out of a man in that 
way. I say everybody oughter rise and drum Yennard 
out of the place. It's that, or starvin' for us an' our 
children ! " 

" What's the row with Forbes? " asked Dane. 

" Bin discharged ; four on 'em." 

Thomas Vennard's anger had s'pent itself here, when 
it might have been vented on him. Perhaps better. 





From the bottom of his heart he pitied Forbes, think- 
ing of the home where want must soon stare them in 
the face, unless charity fed them. 

Forbes had commenced again. He was spokesman 
for the party, and ill-judged as his harangue was, it 
contained a certain amount of truth and rugged elo- 
quence, interspersed with now and then a vengeful oath. 

Some one touched Dane's shoulder. Turning, he 
beheld Adams. 

" Come along," said the latter, almost crossly. 

Stephen looked fairly at him, with an expression that 
said, proudly enough, 

"My sympathies are here." 

"I know it," the other answered, as if the look had 
been words : " but what good do you do, listening to 
an angry man's denunciation of something he doesn't 
understand ? " 

" He seems to understand that he and his children 
may starve." 

"When you want to demolish a solid stone wall, it's 
best not to take your fist. Forbes and Benner have 
carried their point a little too far. Mr. Vennard 
doesn't allow of but one master. They knew it. 
They had seen it tried before." 

He was leading Stephen away. 

" We don't look at these things in the same light," 
said Dane, in a resolute tone. "You don't like Ven- 
nard, yet you always stand up for him." 



 

"From a principle you would call cowardly and 
selfish, I suppose. I think it is best that the workmen 
should learn that he is to be obeyed. If you want the 
employment, you must take it on his terms. There's 
no other large iron works around here. He can dictate, 
and he means to. It's fighting against the stone wall, 
as I said." 

" And a man's to give up all his independence, all 
his spirit, his sense of what is right and just " 

w Dane, you are a little too far on one side. Ven- 
nard is a hard master in some respects, I grant, but he 
pays the men as well as they have ever been paid 
before, " 

" And works them twice as hard ! " was the bitter 
interruption. 

"I think they had fallen into very idle, disorderly 
habits. It takes pretty hard discipline to bring such 
men around straight. Vennard's had a sharp way of 
doing it, I grant you, but he hasn't asked for any more 
than his own. When he went down and found Forbes 
and some of the others playing ' seven up,' he dis- 
charged them on the spot. That they had only been 
playing a few moments, while there was nothing for 
them to do, was no excuse whatever in his eyes. It was 
his time they were using for their own gratification. 
And in trying to justify themselves, they made him 
still more angry. He wasn't in the best of humor, you 
know." 





K It was a mean shame ! And Forbes is a good, 
honest \v irkman. He doesn't pull off his apron with 
the first stroke of the bell. I've seen him stop minutes 
to finish something." 

"Mr. Vennard doesn't ask that. He wouldn't take 
a favor fron a workman. When he gets what he 
has paid for, he is satisfied, but he wants every inch 
of that. You were right when you said I didn't like 
him. I might brave him to-morrow, and the next day 
find a new place. I've no family to keep me here, or 
to starve, if I was out of work u while. But since 
I've taken the position, and know pretty well what 
he wants, I'll satisfy him if it's in my power. I 
think I can do it without losing my independence, 
except just so much as I knowingly relinquished 
when I made my bargain. A person in an inferior 
position has to yield something. Why not do it with 
a good grace ? " 

Stephen Dane walked along moodily. Presently 
a savage glow shot out of his eye. 

" It's always the way ! These men with money and 
power are tyrants." 

w Yes, you find it so pretty often." 
. " And is the world to go on so forever ? Are the 
rich always to grind the souls of the poor ? " 

" The world's a big place, Dane. And there are 
many noble exceptions, I am glad to admit. We 
have fallen upon one of the hard problems. Ven- 



 

nard has a narrow mind, and cannot see consequences. 
He thinks his system is perfect. But ther ; is such 
a thing as crowding on too much steam. Whether he 
will be able to find men to fill these places five years 
hence, is a question ! " 

" Then he'll shut up the place. I can't fancy Ven- 
nard giving in. But as Forbes said, he will make 
Tregony a pauper's den." 

"Yes. These men can never. see, after all. When 
you teach a workman to respect himself, to be prov- 
ident, to educate hi children, to lay up a little money 
if possible, you have made a good citizen for the state, 
a man whose honor you can depend on. You will not 
.have to be taxed for his support in the poorhouse. 
But Vennard looks only at to-day. He wants the 
work done so he can see the immediate profits. I don't 
know that heaven or earth could convert him to any 
other way of thinking. So the men must study self- 
interest. Since it is necessary for them to have employ- 
ment, they must abide by his laws. They are in no 
position to dictate." 

"It's a burning, bitter shame," broke in Dane, with 
the scornful indignation of a generous man. 

" But one must take the world as he finds it ; " and 
Adams shrugged his shoulders. He had many good 
impulses, but he would never have made a philan- 
thropist. 

They halted at the corner, where their paths diverged. 





" Leave these men to settle their squabbles, Dane, and 
think of the engine. There's a fortune for some one in 
that," Adams said, as a parting rejoinder. 

But Stephen Dane was in no mood for such thought. 
He felt angry and sick at heart, with a sense of black 
injustice all around him. Why did power and wealth 
ever come to such men as Thomas Vennard? Was 
there a God who kept watch of these matters, checking 
them off when they reached a certain point ? 

He had been to church the Sunday before with Joe, 
in all the glory of her new bonnet. A little Episcopa- 
lian Chapel, and in their reading of the Psalter these 
words had stirred him strangely : 

" I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, 
and flourishing like a green bay tree. 

" I went by, and lo, he was gone." 

Thomas Vennard, so strongly intrenched, could not 
be easily removed. Dane little knew how he was 
destined to think of this again. 



 



IV. 

BY THE KlVER. 

IF Joe failed to understand Stephen, and misinter- 
preted his desire for her improvement, she was not 
ignorant of fi keener sensation of happiness than any 
she had hitherto known ; and at the same moment a 
new capability for pain dawned upon her. Stephen 
came so near to her in some matters, was so widely 
sundered in others. And whatever took him from her. 

the tavern, the garden-plot he cultivated this sum- 
mer, his books, or a call at intervals from Mr. Adams 

were all regarded with a vague, dull jealousy. He 
was better-tempered than in his first essay after knowl- 
edge. His heart had grown broader, his patience of a 
finer quality. His first impulse had been to leave 
Tregony, and carve out a new life for himself, distinct 
from her's and his father's. Some subtile tie held him 
back. Naturally, I think, the man had a very affec- 
tionate heart. 

So he staid, and tried to raise them out of this slough 
he meaut to leave behind. It was hard work. Archy 





Dane found more comfort in the tavern than in his son's 
society. Joe was prouder of her new finery than any 
mental improvement. She had no ambition, but all a 
woman's tender, longing desire foolish also, if you 
will to be loved. And when Stephen was tender, it 
seemed as if the blessing was not so far distant. More 
than that she did not understand in him. That he 
might be rich some day never entered her head. That 
he might gain some higher station was equally improb- 
able to her. In fact, why should he want it? Were 
not these common-place people around them happy 
enough? They were all she cared to know about. 

Not so with Stephen Dane. His brain had been 
fired with new "thoughts; and, though only half com- 
prehended, he meant to work them up into something 
higher than this dogging on year after year. He wanted 
something sharp, incisive. Pain, even, and failure, 
were better than stagnation. And, somewhere in the 
distance, life looked noble and chivalric, the vulgarities 
cleared off, the meannesses drowned out by an overflow 
of soul. For a man had something within him, call it 
instinct, or even ambition. 

It was hard work. No one that would understand 
these daring thoughts, even if he had the courage to 
confess them. Not even Adams. He could see how 
Dane might like to invent, or improve on a machine. 
So much steel, and iron, and steam was a child to him. 
He gave it the love of husband and father. He would 



 

spend his life for it. It was a mania with the man ; 
and though he occasionally ran foul of some "ism," he 
was not sufficiently interested in it to spend much time 
or thought combating it. The greatest elevation the 
world wanted, in his eyes, was in machinery. As to 
morals and virtues, it always had done well enough, and 
always would. So there was a point where contact 
between the two men ceased. 

Perhaps the grace, beauty, and culture of a lost gen- 
eration woke to existence in Stephen Dane. Some whim 
of blood, having long lain dormant, was exerting itself. 
He saw a possibility in the steam-engine ; but beyond 
it, a broader and grander one, a sphere of refinement, 
an ease, a certain elegance, such as little Hope Vennard 
shook out of every fold of her dress. Her father was 
narrow and hard, but it did not cling to her. And 
when he had won a place in the world, when he had 
acquired the ease, the education, he meant to have, the 
home with its books, and pictures, and fascinating re- 
pose, this was what he could not tell ; this was 
what made the great gulf between him and Joe. 

He went on with sturdy courage. He had too much 
hard work on hand to stick fast in the tangled depths 
where John Gilbert floundered. And though his soul 
was vexed with the selfishness, injustice, and crime that 
stalked about rampant, he knew his beginning must be 
small : Joe, his father, and himself. After that, a wider 





They studied the engine daily, he and Adams. He 
had much natural quickness of understanding, penetra- 
tion, and that subtile knowledge connecting cause with 
effect. Here Adams was slower. Yet they both seemed 
as far from the discovery as Mr. Vennard. 

The affair with Forbes had created quite an excite- 
ment. When the man's anger had cooled somewhat, 
and stern necessity stared him blankly in the face, he 
had humbled himself sufficiently to solicit back his old 
place. Mr. Vennard was immovable. No entreaties 
could soften him. It was a rule he had never broken, 
and never would. The men knew one discharge was 
final. And so Forbes, with the passion of desperation, 
joined the disaffected, drank bad rum, and made threat- 
ening speeches. Thomas Vennard did not care. Quiet 
Tregony would have dreamed of the judgment-day as 
soon as of a murderer lying in wait ; so the threats 
were treated as idle bravado, and remembered at a 
later day, when they proved well nigh fatal. 

One July afternoon Stephen Dane went into the 
engine-room for some particular screws he wanted. It 
was used as a sort of general receptacle rather than a 
work-room. Here lay prostrate fly-wheels of- different 
sizes, walking-beams for fast river-boats, cross-heads 
and piston-rods, lighter machinery for manufacturing 
purposes, waiting for some hand to put them together 
in their proper order, and the breath of steam to endow 
them with life. A dim atmosphere, smoky and dusty,

yet bronzed to a certain beauty by the broad sheets of 
sunlight that flowed in at the windows, grimy a'nd cob- 
webbed as they were. It always appeared so strangely 
still in here to Stephen ; and yet he could hear the roar 
of the fires below, the clang of hammers, the continu- 
ous rattle of bars and chains in transit. Here was the 
engine that had defied Thomas Vennard., If it had 
been human and Stephen Dane gave a sort of grim 
smile. Being iron, it was not susceptible to the master's 
frowns, neither could it be discharged. 

He leaned his elbow on the eccentric-rod, and peered 
down into its black depths. What secret did it hold? 
These wheels and valves, this burnished steel, and sil- 
very-gray iron. What power was mighty enough to 
extort a confession? Was there a fortune in it, as 
Adams had said? He needed the fortune sorely. 
Money would do so much for him give him leisure 
and cultivation, time and material for experiments. 
What torture could he apply to this great dumb thing? 
And unconsciously he ground his teeth and clenched his 
hands. How many times he and Adams had inspected 
it ! There was a drawing in his pocket he had brought 
to show the foreman, who was absent to-day from sud- 
den illness. He took it out, and went over it with his 
pencil, comparing, computing. He had hit upon some- 
thing at length, a slight difference; but it might be of 
momentous import to them. If Adams were but here I

He did not see the cool, keen eye that glanced in 





upon him, the compressed lips and significant nod, as 
the paper and pencil became visible. A sort of evil, 
tyrannical look, that meant to be doubly paid for this 
patience. No, for a sudden moment of inspiration came 
to Stephen Dane. I think Thomas Vennard understood 
as much, watching the working of the face. The dull, 
earthy look faded out of it. The eyes grew luminous. 
The fingers could hardly keep pace with the thoughts. 

Whenever Stephen Dane lived over this period, it 
seemed to him like a flash, a breath. Five minutes, at 
the utmost, he would have said, from the time he en- 
tered the room, intent upon the screws, until a slow, 
metallic voice startled him. 

"I'll take that now, Dane, if you are through 
with it." 

The hot blood rushed to Stephen Dane's face as he 
beheld Mr. Vennard. He was utterly speechless. 

"Do you hear me?" sternly, and thrusting out his 
hand until the bony fingers almost settled themselves 
upon the paper. 

Dane drew back, all the man within him roused. He 
knew he had come to an issue with the master, the very 
thing he had hitherto tried to avoid. But now it must 
be met. 

"I wanted some screws," he began, in a wandering, 
uncertain manner, as if but half awake. 

" And I want that paper. Give it to me, and we'll call 
it square. An hour of my time. It belongs to me." 



 

Both men glanced at it. The eager light in Ven- 
nard's eyes startled Stephen Dane. If that little plan 
was worth anything, it was of value to him. 

" An hour ! " he said. " I have not been here an hour." 

" Do you mean to tell me that I lie ? I passed that 
door one hour ago, and you were here." 

Vennard's overreaching defeated itself by violence. 
Every fibre of independence in Stephen Dane's nature 
was roused. 

"No, Mr. Vennard," he said, with a cool spirit that 
exasperated the other. I had no such thought. It 
seems the briefest moment to me, and yet you may be 
right. I am willing to lose the time." 

It was to be a hand-to-hand fight. Bullying would 
gain nothing here. 

The two men eyed each other closely. Dane saw 
that his race in the Ellicott Works was run ; Vennard 
read that he had a powerful adversary. 

"I want that paper. Dane, if you have a grain of com- 
mon honesty, honor we don't expect from such men, 
you will see that I had a right to the time. And 
this improvement is mine. You have no business with 
anything pertaining to it." 

He overshot the mark widely that time. How easily 
a little passion leads a man astray ! 

"Except what my own brains give me." 

"I say you have wo -right. Try one experiment, if 
you dare, and I will restrain you by an injunction."
