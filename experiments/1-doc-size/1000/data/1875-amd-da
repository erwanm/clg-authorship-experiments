looking up and down the street, Mrs. Dawson espied 
him, and summoned him within, explaining what was 
wanted of him. 

Jemmy went through with his usual scrape and tug 
at his hat, but looked decidedly awkward. 

" Are you sure that you saw Mr. Tremaine?" Dora 
asked. 

Jemmy flushed at the sound of the low, sweet voice, 
and stared until his face grew redder than before. 

"Tell me how you found the place," she went on 
encouragingly. 

"Sure, I hunted up an' down the street lookin' for 
the sign, an' when I found it, a man stood by the door. 
'Who did you want?' ses he, an' I ses — c Mr. Tre- 
maine.' 'That is my name,' ses he, an' then I gev 
him the note. ' That is lucky,' says he, ' for I was just 
goin' up to Woodlea, an' with that he ses thankee, my 
lad, and crammed it in his pocket." 

"What kind of a looking man was he?" Dora 
asked. 

Jemmy stared in blank wonder. 

" Was he tall, and did he have a full brown beard? " 

" Yes, a big pair of whiskers. I think he was tall ;" 
came more hesitatingly. Truth to tell, Jemmy remem- 
bered very little about him. 


"That will do," said Dora, wearily. "I am much 
obliged." 

Jemmy pulled his hat and backed out of the room. 
Dora turned her face over on the pillow and was silent 
a long while. 



CHAPTER XI. 

FACING TATE. 

mIDINGr away her face, Dora Tremaine shed 
many bitter tears. The truth was plain 
enough, she thought. Jasper had gone to her 
husband and told him the story — and what would have 
roused his sympathy under any other circumstances, 
appeared now an act of shameful treachery. Shocked 
and stunned, he had not cared to see her. Indeed, why 
should he? Too merciful to upbraid, too just and too 
upright to take her in his arms and kiss the poor throb- 
bing brow and the pale, cold lips. Ah, to be shut out 
of such love and tenderness, to be put away in dreary 
silence. No wonder he had not hastened to her when 
they must stand apart and only look the longing it had 
become a sin to speak. 

And as he waited hour by hour, day by day, the 
sense of truth and right had grown stronger upon him. 
Would it have changed anything if she had gone to 
him at first? No, there was the awful, the irrevocable 
fact that neither could alter. She was the wife of 
another! Death had not dissolved the bond — and if 
the law could, there would be a long delay. Even then 



Mr. Tremaine might hesitate about taking a divorced 
woman, a woman who had deceived him, back to his 
heart. On all sides, her case looked hopeless. 

" Catherine," she called, feebly. 

" What is it, my bairn?" 

" Oh, Catherine, you will never, never desert me! 
Promise that you will be tender as mothers are to their 
unfortunate children. I shall want a friend, I may 
want a home, even. Will you and Mark be kind to 
me in distress ? I seem so utterly forlorn and helpless, 
so shut away from those who might befriend me at any 
other time. Have I sinned irremediably?" 

" It was not your fault. God will hold you guiltless, 
I know. And if Mr. Tremaine had come, had heard 
jour story, he could hardly have blamed. Some evil 
fate seems laid upon you. But for life or death, no 
mother can be tenderer or more true than I shall be 
to you, my poor, dear child." 

" If he should come again, Catherine — Jasper Came- 
ron, I mean — I must see him. I want to know all, 
the very worst that he can do ! " 

" Wait until to-morrow. You are weak and have 
fatigued yourself so much already." 

" No, my good Catherine ; let me get through with 
this trouble, and to-morrow you will find me most 
obedient. The suspense and anxiety nearly drive me 
wild." . 

Even as she spoke, there was a low, peculiar knock 
at the door, and Catherine started nervously. 




" That is Jasper Cameron," she said. 

" Leave me alone, please ; but stay within hearing — 
in the next room ; and, oh, Catherine, do not go away 
for an instant." 

There was a world of entreaty # in Dora's pathetic eyes, 
and the slender hands clasped each other. 

'  My child, no. Must you see him ? " 

"It will be better, I think. Go. He will become 
impatient. " 

Catherine held quite a long parley with her visitor. 
If it had been possible still to exclude him, she would 

have done so ; but he was very urgent. 

" The doctor has said that it would be perilous to 
disturb her, " Catherine answered, sternly. 

"But just to see her, to exchange half a dozen words 
with her, is all I ask. If you knew what she is to me, 
you could not be so obdurate. " 

An expression of contempt curled Catherine's lip. 
It was not lost upon Cameron, who noted everything, 
in case he might need the clue afterwards. 

She ushered him in with evident reluctance. Step- 
ping into the little parlor, he gave one glance around, 
and half kneeling at the side of the bed, exclaimed in 
tones of tragic pathos — 

"My dear, dear wife! To see you at last, even 
here—" 

"Do not call me by that name, Jasper Cameron!" 
And Dora's eyes flashed for an instant. 



He glanced at her with a mean, masterful expression 
that made her shudder. It said that he could dare an}-- 
thing, since he had the power on his side. 

" I have not been able to see you until to-da}*, " she 
began, feebly, realizing at the moment how weak she 
had grown, " and I should not now, except that I want- 
ed to ask you a question. You have seen Mr. Tre- 
maine ! " 

It was more assertion than* question. He revolved 
in his mind for a few seconds how much he should 
admit. For he had the habit, this Jasper Cameron, of 
stopping at no lie. His faculty of invention was neat 
and plausible. 

Interpreting his silence wrongly, she continued with 
great earnestness, 

' ' After giving you my word that I would not attempt 
to see him*, it was cowardly, unmanly in the extreme, 
to strike a defenceless woman in that manner ! You 
went to him — you must have gone the very instant 
that you parted with me, and told him — Heaven onty. 
knows what ! If there had been any pity for you in 
my heart before, that would have crushed it! You 
could not have taken a more effectual method, Jasper 
Cameron ! " 

She had not seen Mr. Tremaine then. To be sure 
he had been working for this end, but some strong feel- 
ing on the gentleman's part must have kept him from 
Dora, even if he had not received the suinmons, unless 



indeed, he could not guess at her hiding-place. At 
any rate fate favored him, he thought with some ex- 
ultation. 

"When I reconsidered," he began in. a bland tone, 
" I thought that it was barbarous to keep Mr. Tre- 
maine in the dark. You know that I proposed our 
going together, and you refused. Was it not kind in 
me to give him an opportunity to seek you if he de- 
sired ?" 

She writhed at this. 

"After your statement ! " she said, with all the scorn 
she could command, " You told him — " 

" The truth ! " and Jasper Cameron raised his voice, 
mentally resolving that Mr. Tremaine should be in- 
formed according to this programme. " That you were 
my wife, and that no law and no power should compel 
me to give you up. Heavens, Dora ! I am more reso- 
lute to-day than at our first interview ! " 

"What can you do?" 

She asked the question with a fearlessness that 
angered him. And there crept into his heart a strange 
mixture of love and admiration for this brave, beautiful 
woman. 

" I could prove myself your master. I could order 

you to be taken from this place and kept under my 

protection until the law divorced us, which it can 

never do. Since I am willing to forgive the past, love 

you and care for you, you would have a hard matter in- 


deed to make out any cause against me. There is noth- 
ing but the humiliating confession that you have been 
untrue, and loved another man." 

" There is the truth that I shall never shrink from, 
or be ashamed of, that, believing you dead, I married 
another. I shall love him to my life's end." 

" You are bold in your infidelity, madam," he ex- 
claimed, with a sneer. 

She flushed deeply. Was it necessary to endure this 
man's insults? 

" Catherine," she called. 

Jasper Cameron frowned. He much preferred that 
there should be no witness to their conversation. 

Catherine Dawson entered. Besides the almost 
. stern look habitual to her, she showed plainly in every 
line of her face, her scorn and dislike of Cameron. 

" I am not utterly friendless," Dora began in a low, 
yet clear tone. " This woman has been a witness to 
my daily life, since shortly after my mother's death. 
She saw my acquaintance with Mr. Tremaine, my mar- 
riage, and we have been trusty friends. To her I con- 
fided my story. If you have any proposal to make, I 
wish you to do it now and here. Since you have taken 
unfair advantage of my silence, I do not hold myself 
bound by any promise concerning Mr. Tremaine. I 
shall see him whenever I choose." 

"This person knows then that you are my wife?" 
Jasper Cameron said with a supercilious smile. 



" She knows, that, as a child, I was over persuaded to 
marry you, and that a few words, binding in law, per- 
haps, link us together in a fatal manner: But as God 
bears me witness, I shall never be the wife of any man 
save Ralph Tremaine." 

"You prejudge my case altogether," he said in a 
wounded tone. " You give me no opportunity to show 
love or tenderness. How can you tell, parted as we 
were the very hour of our marriage, that you will never 
be able to love me ? All I ask is a fair trial. Let me 
visit you as a friend for a few weeks, prove to you my 
sincere sorrow that I should have even seemed to for- 
feit my claim on your regard. When* you have heard 
my story, perhaps you may think me deserving of a 
little pity, as well as Mr. Tremaine." 

"It cannot alter the fact that I do not love you," 
and her clear, incisive tone would have brought a knell 
of despair to any man who truly loved. 

For a moment Jasper Cameron was silent. Truth to 
tell, the presence of a third person disconcerted him, 
and somehow he felt that indulging any extravagant 
demonstrations of affection would prove a farce. 

" I want you to make your plans without the slight- 
est possibility of my changing. There is none. If I 
never saw Mr. Tremaine again, if he cast me utterly 
from him in anger, still, before God, he would be my 
husband. If I saw you daily, I could not relent. 
Nay, there would come an utter loathing and abhor- 


rence, until I should welcome the deepest dungeon, if it 
but shut me from your sight. Now you know my feel- 
ings — what have you to propose ? " 

"You are ill and not fit to discuss this subject. 
Some day when a calmer frame of mind succeeds your 
present excitable state — " 

" There can come but one — death." 

She uttered the words so. solemnly that he felt awed 
in spite of himself. And yet her stubborn resolve au- 
gered him. He was convinced that she would resolutely 
keep to her word, and that nothing could re-awaken a 
tenderness in her soul for him. Oh, why had he been 
so hasty in those old days. A fortnight's patience and 
delay would have saved all to him, the wealth that he 
coveted, the woman that he longed to subjugate. To 
be master of this proud, defiant Dora ! 

There was a long pause, and Dora Tremaine felt that 
her strength was giving way. 

"If I have made no plans for the future, it was be- 
cause I hoped to win your favor at length," he began 
slowly. "The law of course consigns you to my 
care — " 

" I am not so sure of that ! " she interrupted. 

He was losing his temper. "At least," he said, 
" until you are free from your bond to me, you are my 
wife. Make one attempt to return to Mr. Tremaine, 
and I shall proceed to the utmost limits of the law. 
If you are desirous to have your folly and disgrace 



bruited abroad, jou know now what course to pursue. 
In that case I shall not be merciful." 

Mercy! There was none in the man's soul — that 
she knew, 

. " You need not fear my returning to Mr. Tremaine 
until I can do so honorably," she answered with bitter 
scorn. 

For the present then, you will remain here ?* 

Dora turned wearily. 

"For the present," she replied in a feeble tone. 

"You have talked quite long enough," Catherine 
Dawson said, coming forward. "You can see how 
much she is exhausted." 

It was growing plainly evident. A blue line lingered 
about her lips and a deep shadow underneath her eyes. 
Every feature seemed strained and rigid with intense 
emotion. 

" I shall come in to-morrow," he announced loftily, 
as if no one had a right to gainsay him. In the mean- 
time Mrs. and he looked keenly at Catherine, but 

she made no sign—" spare no pains or expense. Al- 
though she will hot believe it," and he lowered his 
voice, " she is very dear to me. Are you alone? Do 
you not need a nurse, or some assistance?" 

" Nothing," Catherine replied sternly. " If she can 
have peace ancl quiet she will soon recover, for she has 
a fine constitution. Otherwise I will not answer for her." 

''If you should be-*- in need of anything r^" and 



Jasper Cameron slipped his hand into his pocket with a 
thoughtful air. 

" Nothing from you ! " Catherine Dawson said with 
undisguised contempt. 

He bowed jauntily and sauntered down the street, 
turning the first corner. A young man of two or three- 
and-twenty, rather seedy looking, started from some 
nook below and walked slowly toward him with a rather 
peculiar air. 

" Well, Dan?" Cameron's voice had a pleasant, in- 
different sound. 

"Will I go on, sir? It is hardish work just loung- 
ing round in one spot. Nothin' happens." 

' ' You are paid for it — as well as if you broke stones 
on the road, and it is not as tiresome. Yes, you will 
go on. If a sick woman should be taken away from 
this house by day or by night, you are to follow and 
see where she goes. And if a man calls — you remem- 
ber the description ? " 

"Yes." 

" If you can hang round and hear anything — " 

" Yes." 

" Keep a good watch. You will not regret serving 
me, my fine fellow," and Jasper Cameron took out his 
well-filled pocket-book and selected therefrom a note. 

u Thankee. I will find out all I can, you may depend 
upon that." 

Cameron walked away with a satisfied air, as if he 





 



were a benevolent gentleman-relieving some poor wretch. 
Something sharp caught his finger as he returned the 
pocket-book to its place. 

" By Jove!" he muttered, "it is not a very sensi- 
ble thing, keeping this note;" and taking out the 
crumpled missive he perused it again with a sinister 
smirk. Catherine Dawson's message that had cost her 
so much care and trouble. 

"Ha ! Ha !" he laughed, just above his breath. "Jas- 
per Cameron is a sharp fellow to deal with, as j t ou will 
learn Mesdames. But was there ever an occurrence 
where everybody was so completely in the dark? Not 
a soul dares show his hand. Tremaine is a fool ! Dora 
ditto, but it serves my purpose excellently. Commend 
me to your innocent people, say I — they will make 
themselves out infinitely more guilty than any rogue 
would. And as for courage — the face of innocence is 
all bosh ! It will not sustain its votaries or victims, 
anywhere, but turns red and confused at the first accusa- 
tion. I may as well destroy this, seeing that it has 
answered my purpose. Odd how everything plays into 
my hands! Oh, my lady Dora, I know how many 
heartaches you have had over j-our husband's tacit re- 
fusal to come to terms. I must see him now, to keep 
my story good. And whj r not? I am not sure but it 
is the very best move I can make. I shall know the 
dearly devoted' s sentiments, and whether he is of the 
forgiving order. I must manage her somehow. After 



I have hunted her down she may be willing to do the 
handsome thing and buy herself off at a large figure. 
September — and now it is June ! Hang it ! I wish I 
had not taken it up in quite such a hurry. But then 
she never can know unless Colby is fool enough to tell 
her. The man is a villian in all but courage ! A weak, 
drivelling fool ! But I must see them both. Gad ! If 
Dora could be kept out of sight for two or three months, 
the thing might work. Jasper, that is a lucky thought ! 
Dangle that bait temptingly beforo Colby's eyes, and 
ten to one if he does not snap at it. Half without an}' 
encumbrance — by Jove! that is worth trying for. 
Only, Mrs. Dora, I would like to take you in hand," 
and he ground his boot heel savagely on the pavement, 
while a diabolical gleam flashed out of his eye. " But 
women never do pay, so where would be the satisfac- 
tion. To keep her away from Tremaine will be enough. 
Yes, the man is a fool — 'if he loves her ! I will judge 
of that before I am twenty-four hours older." 

Cameron lighted his cigar and sauntered jauntily 
along, maturing his plans. Of his interview on the 
following day with both Mr. Tremaine and Colby, the 
reader is already aware. It seemed indeed as if some 
fatal fortune favored him. He hesitated at' no false- 
hood, he could witness the sufferings of others calmly, 
and take advantage of the slightest incident that could 
be turned to his own account . A bold, gentlemanly, 
plausible YilWn. ! 


CHAPTER XII. 

JASPER CAMERON PROPOSES A TRUCE. 

IFTER Catherine Dawson had dismissed Mr. 
Cameron she returned to Dora, who needed 
instant attention, and she had hardly restored 
her patient to a tranquil state of mind when the doctor 
made his appearance. 

" Mrs. Dawson," he began rather sharply, u There has 
been some bad work here ! She is feverish and excited, 
with a galloping pulse, and nerves that might have 
been wrung out of boiling water. My injunctions have 
not been obeyed." 

" Do not blame her," Dora pleaded faintly. 

"It was my fault. She is the best and tenderest 
nurse that one could have." 

" But you take your own way ; " and he smiled a little, 
softening his voice. u Of what avail is our good work 
if you undo it so soon ! Did you sit up ? " 

" No." 

" Then you talked a good deal, which was infinitely 
worse. You were much improved this morning ! " 

" And I am better now, stronger. Oh, doctor, have 
no fear ! People never die when they desire it ardently." 


There was a strong, cold despair in her tone that 
touched him. 

"You did not wish to die," he said softly, and yet 
confidently. 

Did she? If Ralph Tremaine must be taken out of 
her life, then death, or anything. 

After that, as the summer twilight closed in around 
the two women, both were silent. Dora was thinking 
endlessly of her husband. How implacable he must 
be, to know that she was ill, suffering, and not desire 
to see her, not even send to ask after her* Why, she 
might die ! For, if his love had received so great a 
wound that he did not care to look upon her face, he 
might still have a little tender regard for her who had 
once been so dear. How cruel to think that he had 
lost all interest. 

Perhaps she condemned him unjustly. She wanted 
to be merciful and right. He might not have recovered 
from the shock ; indeed, she knew not what horrible 
version of the story he might have heard. She almost 
wondered, that, understanding her so well, and having 
so few of the facts of her past life, he believed the 
the story at all. Would she have taken into her con- 
fidence a stranger, and listened to some monstrous 
accusation against her husband ? No, a thousand limes 
no! 

All night she tossed about restlessly. It was very 
warm, and she missed her spacious room with its cool, 



fragrant breezes. More than all, the loving heart that 
had pillowed her, the fond lips that had kissed her be- 
tween snatches of sleep. Oh, what if the place could 
never be hers again ! 

"My child, you have worried yourself sadly," Mrs. 
Dawson said, looking at the haggard face. 

"Oh, Catherine, I do not know which way to turn ! 
Does it not seem to you that Mr. Tremaine might come ? 
Does he care whether I live or die ? " 

' ' Yes he might come ! " Catherine exclaimed bluntly. 

"It is cruel for him to stop away at such a time. 
Even if he believed that villain's story — " 

"The story is true, you know. He can hardly help 
believing that. And when he thinks that I am not his 
^nfe — perhaps never can be again — oh, it is horrible, 
is it not? The best thing would be for me to die, and 
yet I do not feel like dying, only dragging through a 
hopeless, miserable life. I do not know — maybe my 
notions are not very clear, but if he had commuted any 
crime, I should have clung to him ; at least, I should 
have been tender and wanted to comfort — " 

Her voice died away in a dreary sigh. 

" Suppose we were to write again — or even if I were 
to go to Woodlea? — " 

"No, Catherine, I could not be left alone. The 
letter might do. I think I will write by-and-by. I 
wish I had asked Jasper Cameron just what he told 
him. When he comes this morning I want to see him." 



"But the doctor— " 

" No matter. I might as well talk and injure my- 
self as to keep up an incessant worry ! Yes I must 
see him. Then I will decide what it is best to do." 

But Jasper Cameron did not come. He had more 
important matters on hand that morning. 

What if the whole thing was a hideous lie ! * If she 
could only think that she had been very ill and dreamed 
it! 

Jasper Cameron was much better prepared for the 
next interview. It was mid-afternoon when he made 
his appearance, in his usual easy, half insolent fashion. 
Dora's heart sank within her at once. 

" I hope you are improving?" he said with a great 
appearance of cordiality ; but the wan eyes and sunken 
face did not betoken much in the way of recovery. 

She gave him a sort of haughty glance, and did not 
reply immediately. He had formed plans for every 
conceivable emergency, which he could put into execu- 
tion with the rapidity of a thought, or pass by without 
the slightest feeling of disappointment, while her brain 
was in a weary tumult of fear and despair. Turn 
whichever way she would, she saw no hope. 

He gathered no encouragement from that stony face, 
but he followed out his role as exactly as if he expected 
it to be quite convincing. 

" Dora," he began almost plaintively, "I have been 
thinking this matter over continually since our last in- 


terview, and have discussed it with my frieiid, who is 
most anxious to try his powers of persuasion upon 
you. It all comes back to this fact — you are my legal 
wife. You cannot resume honorable relations with Mr. 
Tremaine at present ; Indeed, from what I have heard 
and seen, he is not the kind of man to risk any great 
scandal." 

"You told him!" Dora exclaimed fiercely. "You 
had no mercy, but struck that cruel blow to the soul of 
the best and tenderest of men ! " 

" I told him, certainly. Dora, could j'ou have gone 
on in your relations with him, knowing that I was still 
alive?" 

There was ah air of surprised and injured innocence 
about the man that nearly maddened Dora. She 
roused herself and sprang up from the pillow. 

" Oh," she said, her eyes flashing scornfulty, "you 
need not distress yourself about my morality ! As I 
told you, I entrusted the whole story to a friend for 
Mr. Tremaine, believing, as God is my witness, that 
you were dead. I should no more have married him 
with that between us, than I should have cut off my 
right hand. It is my misfortune and misery now that 
this, friend was not true to his trust. I have made but 
one fearful mistake, and that was not confessing imme- 
diately. I know what lies between us now, and you 
need not fear that I shall so forget my womanly honor 
as to take one step, either with you or him that any 


person might question. I shall not see you again 
except in the presence off a witness." 

There was a long silence. Dora realized how com 
pletely she was shut out from any claim upon Tre- 
maine. All this time she had been hoping — she knew 
not exactly what — but if Ralph would come, would 
forgive her unwitting deception, and look at the future 
with her, considering what was best to be done, her 
.burthen would seem so much lighter. She would be 
willing to abide by his decision. Even if they were 
parted forever by an inexorable fate, so long as she 
could think of him as a dear friend, sorrowing with 
herself, it would be such an heaventy comfort compared 
to this black despair. 

" You told him all? " Dora's voice was cold, though 
tremulous with anguish. 

" I told him the truth — explained to him that I had 
made attempts to send you word of my existence, and 
that — I loved you still." 

These last words were uttered with the very refine- 
ment of cruelty. 

"Jasper Cameron, you do not love me!" she re- 
plied with bitter emphasis. "You do not know the 
meaning of the word, you never did ! " 

He. bit his lip in a passion of anger, but it was not 
allowed to appear on his handsome face. Rising, he 
came to the bedside, and clasped his hands with a 
pathetic air. 



"Dora/* and his tone waa low, held in a powerful 
check. " Try me. I ask it humbly, sincerelj\ Give 
me a chance to vindicate myself, to be true and tender. 
My whole life shall be devoted to you. I will make 
amends for all that may have seemed neglectful in the 
past. Just once, Dora — a month, any time you may 
choose to appoint." 

" You weary me," she said with cold disdain. "We 
can never, never be anything to each other — even if 
Ralph Tremaine were dead — so cease your importu- 
nity. If you have any business, explain that, and then 
cease to persecute me by j r our presence." 

' ' What do you propose to do ? " 

He asked the question insolently, and she felt that 
she was in his power, disguise it as she might. 

" Die, if it is God's will. If not — endure to the 
end. No loneliness, nor anguish, nor despair, shall 
change my purpose. If you dared to try to take me 
away, I should publish to the whole world that I hated 
you. I cannot be forced into any step." 

He knew that he had no supreme power over this 
woman's soul. To resort to force might be to dare an 
unwelcome crisis. 

"Dora," he said presently, "I have one offer to 
make, although I think few men wV>uld be as generous. 
You are weak and excited now, and absolutely incapa- 
ble of taking a fair view of the case. If I wanted to 
be revenged for your confessed hatred of me, I could 




do it by frustrating all your efforts to gain any kind of 
legal freedom. I feel at times, when you rouse the 
demon within me, as if I should do this, but in the end 
it would be poor satisfaction. And still, I am hardly 
convinced but that you might be won to love me. Let 
us, therefore, consent to a truce. For the next three 
months you shall live quietly with any friend whom you 
may elect, giving me the privilege of calling occasion- 
ally. If, during that time, your feelings have under- 
gone no change, I will withdraw my claim and no lon- 
ger oppose any statement that the law may be able to 
make. All I ask of you is a promise that you will not 
expose yourself to Mr. Tremaine's influence.. Act 
perfectly honest and fair with me, and you shall not be 
the loser." 

Catherine Dawson bent her neck and shoulders to 
gain a good view of Jasper Cameron's face. His voice 
had carried with it a strange power, as he meant it 
should, but though apparently fair and honest, she fan- 
cied that some sinister motive must be lurking in the 
background. But the face revealed nothing, granting 
that he had other motives. A handsome face, sad and 
touching, and while Catherine could not believe in it, 
neither could she refrain from pitying. 

Dora roused herself again and glanced steadily at 
him. He saw his advantage with both woman. 

" Oh, Dora, how can I give you up ! You said that 
I did not love^rot ! Ah, you can never, never know 


the sacrifice I make in relinquishing all thoughts of 
your love. Still I only ask to be satisfied. There 
have been hours when I would rather see you forever 
wretched than happy with another, but your sufferings 
have conquered that selfish sentiment. " 

He covered his face with his hands. Dora was deep- 
ly and strangely moved. It seemed almost as if happi- 
ness might be possible again. She had said on their 
first meeting that she preferred open enmity, but was 
not a faint fragment of respect better? 

' ' If you mean what you say, Jasper Cameron " — and 
Dora's voice trembled with excitement. 

' 'Heaven knows that I do. If you will but wait 
until I am convinced that my case is entirely hope- 



" And you promise then not to use any mean, treach- 
erous subterfuge ? " 

"I swear it. This time, in September, if you can 
still say that your feelings towards me are unchanged, I 
will do whatever you bid me. If it is to leave my native 
land forever, I will even obey that behest. " 

Dora Tremaine cast about in her mind for the cause 
of this sudden conversion. What motive could impel 
him to this generosity? He had refused her money in 
the first instance, so it was not for any thought of gain. 
Would this step compromise her any in the eyes of the 
world — or most of all, in the eyes of Ralph Tremaine? 
Come what would, she could be nothing to him at present. 



"I do not know," she said, weakly. " I think you 
mean fairly — but somehow I am confused. Will you 
agree that Catherine Dawson shall always be a witness 
to these interviews?" . 

" A hard condition," he replied, slowly. 

" It is the only condition on which I shall grant 
them, " was her decisive answer. 

He affected to consider. You could imagine from" 
the knitted brows that there was a severe struggle 
going on, and yet he had mentally consented the instant 
the words had fallen from her lips. He was not one 
to rouse suspicion by any hasty move. 

" As you will, " he said at length, in a reluctant tone, 
as if the concession had been wrung from him. " In 
return, you will not change your abode without inform- 
ing me?" 

' 'You will find me keeping mj r promise in the slight- 
est particular. Nay, I will endeavor to judge you fair- 
ly — rand though I know well that my love can never 
change, my feelings may soften towards j-ou. " 

" This woman here, Catherine Dawson, I think you 
call her, will be witness to our compact. For three 
months you are to allow me to call once or twice in a 
week. During this time you are to study me in an 
unprejudiced manner, so far as circumstances will allow, 
and not to be swajed from an impartial judgment by 
any representations of Mr. Tremaine's. If by that 
time I have gained no influence over you, I promise to 



abide by your decision. I think you cannot call me 
unreasonable. " 

It all looked very fair. Catherine had been paying 
the closest attention to discover anything like double- 
dealing — but though not altogether convinced of his 
uprightness, she could place her finger on no perceptible 
flaw. 

"Yes," Dora answered, feebly, "I consent. And 
if you deal unfairly with me, Jasper Cameron, Heaven 
requite you in the same measure." 

She looked at him intently with her earnest eyes, and 
saw no more evidence than Catherine had found. 

" Best assured that I shall keep my word." 

"Go now," she said, wearily. "I am tired and 
worn." 

He bowed with respectful reverence and slowly with- 
drew. 

"Catherine!" she called, as Mrs. Dawson went to 
see her visitor safely out of the hall-door. 

" Catherine," — in a low and hurried whisper — " ask 
him — how Mr. Tremaine took the blow — and any- 
thing else. I cannot — of him." 

The woman found Mr. Cameron on the porch. 

"Does the doctor think her really improving?" he 
questioned with much eagerness. . " She looked so 
worn and weak that my heart ached. It has quite 
unmanned me." 

"I believe she will recover. If she could feel at 
ease in her mind." 



" I was hard with her at first, but I could not think 
of relinquishing my claim ; and she was still more severe 
with me. She cannot understand that I love her, have 
loved in spite of silence and absence. " 

" You told Mr. Tremaine this?" she asked, gravely. 

"That I loved her? yes." 

"And how did he bear it ! " 

She uttered the words slowly and with an effort. 

"He was deeply shocked, and of course taken very 
much by surprise. I think — do you know him well?" 

" I have known him for some time." 

"Is he not rather — implacable? slow to forgive in- 
juries? I judged as much from his demeanor. If she 
could forget him." 

"She never will." 

" He may overlook it in time, — at present he seems 
very rigid in his ideas — but the shock was great. One 
cannot blame him so deeply, though." 

She had no more questions to ask. Jasper Cameron 
bowed airily and stepped into the street, glancing back 
once or twice. 

" I fancy that will settle it," he said confidently to 
himself. "My course is about decided now. If I can 
make Colby come to terms, and kciep Dora from Tre- 
maine for a month or so. He is rather sharp, I take it. 
Well, I will trust luck. The jade has befriended me so 
far, I must confess."

j CHAPTER Xm. 

JASPER CAMERON MAKES A FRIEND. 

EDO not know whether I am right or not," 
Dora said wearily, "Fate has closed around 
me like a web. I do not know which way to 
turn." 

" Wait patiently, my child. There may be a* break 
in the clouds by-and-by." 

' ' And you think — oh, will Ralph ever forgive ? But, 
Catherine, I am afraid it is too late to hope for much. 
Can it ever be made right ? If Ralph would come — " 

" You spoke of writing again — ," Catherine ventured 
timidly. 

" Not after what Jasper Cameron said." She had 
dragged the truth out of the woman, word by word. 
" Oh, if I could only tell what to do." 

And so Dora tossed restlessly upon her pillow. 
Catherine went about her household tasks, for Mark 
was coming home that night. What would he say to 
Dora's trouble? He had a generous heart, so there 
was no fear of his grudging the poor creature a home. 
And though Catherine racked her brains for expedients, 
she did not see how they could have done any differ-

ently. More than once she had been tempted to go to 
Mr. Tremaine and tell him how Dora suffered. One 
thought alone restrained her. If he believed that Dora 
was not his wife, and, as such, hesitated to see her, 
through any feeling of displeasure or sense of propriety, 
it would be hardly right to force him into her presence. 
Dora loved him with passionate yearning, tenderness, 
and perhaps in a T?eak moment it might mislead them 
both. No, it was not advisable to thrust them into 
temptation. 

She was glad enough to welcome Mark, with his 
grave smile, and quiet greeting. He had come up the
