me where he was going. I tried to dissuade him 
from the plan, saying he might catch cold; but he 
laughed at me. 

A serenade is an every-day affair, and in the street 
one voice sounds about as well as another. He 
reached the palace, and his heart sank when he saw 
Hedwig's window dark and gloomy. He did not 
know that she was seated behind it in a deep chair, 
wrapped in white things, and listening for him 
against the beatings of her heart. The large moon 
seemed to be spiked on the sharp spire of the church 
that is near her house, and the black shadows cut the 



 

white light as clean as with a knife. Nino had 
tuned his guitar in the other street, and stood ready, 
waiting for the clocks to strike. Presently they 
clanged out wildly, as though they had been waked 
from their midnight sleep, and were angry; one clock 
answering the other, and one convent bell following 
another in the call to prayers. For two full minutes 
the whole air was crazy with ringing, and then it was 
all still. Nino struck a single chord. Hedwig al 
most thought he might hear her heart beating all the 
way down in the street. 

"Ah, del mio dolce ardor bramato ogetto," he 
sang, an old air in one of Gluck's operas, that our 
Italian musicians say was composed by Alessandro 
Stradella, the poor murdered singer. It must be a 
very good air, for it pleases me ; and I am not easily 
pleased with music of any sort. As for Hedwig, 
she pressed her ear to the glass of the window that 
she might not lose any note. But she would not 
open nor give any sign. Nino was not so easily discouraged, for he remembered that she had once opened 
her window for a few bars he had begun to sing. He
played a few chords, and breathed out the "Salve, 
dimora casta e pura," from Faust, high and soft and 
clear. There is a point in that song, near to the 
end, where the words say, "Reveal to me the 
maiden," and where the music goes away to the 
highest note that any one can possibly sing. It al 
ways appears quite easy for Nino, and he does not 
squeak like a dying pig, as all the other tenors do 
on that note. He was looking up as he sang it, wondering whether it would have any effect. Apparently Hedwig lost her head completely, for she gently 
opened the casement and looked out at the moonlight 
opposite over the carved stone mullions of her window. The song ended, he hesitated whether to 
go or to sing again. She was evidently looking 
towards him; but he was in the light, for the moon 
had risen higher, and she, on the other side of the 
street, was in the dark. 

" Signorina ! " he called softly. No answer. " Signorina!" he said again, coming across the empty 
street and standing under the window, which might 
have been thirty feet from the ground. 

"Hush! " came a whisper from above. 

" I thank you with all my soul for listening to me," 
he said in a low voice. " I am innocent of that of 
which you suspect me. I love you, ah, I love you ! " 
But at this she left the window very quickly. She 
did not close it, however, and Nino stood long, 
straining his eyes for a glimpse of the white face 
that had been there. He sighed, and striking a 
chord sang out boldly the old air from the Trovatore, 
"Ah, che la morte ognora tarda nel venir." Every 
blind fiddler in the streets plays it, though he would 
be sufficiently scared if death came any the quicker 
for his fiddling. But old and worn as it is, it has a 
strain of passion in it, and Nino threw more fire and 
voice into the ring of it than ever did famous old 
Boccarde, when he sang it at the first performance of 
the opera, thirty and odd years ago. As he played 
the chords after the first strophe, the voice from above 
whispered again : 

" Hush, for Heaven's sake I " Just that, and some- 



 

thing fell at his feet, with a soft little padded sound 
on the pavement. He stooped to pick it up, and 
found a single rose ; and at that instant the window 
closed sharply. Therefore he kissed the rose and hid 
it, and presently he strode down the street, finishing 
his song as he went, but only humming it, for the 
joy had taken his voice away. I heard him let himself in and go to bed, and he told me about it in the 
morning. That is how I know. 

Since the day after the de*but Nino had not seen 
the baroness. He did not speak of her, and I am 
sure he wished she were at the very bottom of the 
Tiber. But on the morning after the serenade he 
received a note from her, which was so full of protestations of friendship and so delicately couched that 
he looked grave, and reflected that it was his duty to 
be courteous, and to answer such a call as that. She 
begged him earnestly to come at one o clock; she 
was suffering from headache, she said, and was very 
weak. Had Nino loved Hedwig a whit the less, he 
would not have gone. But he felt himself strong 
enough to face anything and everything, and there 
fore he determined to go. 

He found her, indeed, with the manner of a person 
who is ill, but not with the appearance. She was 
lying on a huge couch, pushed to the fireside, and 
there were furs about her. A striped scarf of rich 
Eastern silk was round her throat, and she held in 
her hand a new novel, of which she carelessly cut the 
pages with a broad-hafted Persian knife. But there 
was colour in her dark cheek, and a sort of angry fire 
in her eyes. Nino thought the clean steel in her 



hand looked as though it might be used .for something 
besides cutting leaves, if the fancy took her. 

"So at last you have honoured me with a visit, 
signore," she said, not desisting from her occupation. 
Nino came to her, and she put out her hand. He 
touched it, but could not bear to hold it, for it burned 
him. 

"You used to honour my hand differently from 
that, she half whispered. Nino sat himself down 
a little way from her, blushing slightly. It was not 
at what she had said, but at the thought that he 
should ever have kissed her fingers. 

"Signora," he replied, "there are customs, chiv 
alrous and gentle in themselves, and worthy for all 
men to practice. But from the moment a custom 
begins to mean what it should not, it ought to be 
abandoned. You will forgive me if I no longer kiss 
your hand." 

" How cold you are ! how formal ! What should 
it mean ? " 

"It is better to say too little than too much," he 
answered. 

"Bah!" she cried, with a bitter little laugh. 
" Words are silver, but silence is very often nothing but silver-plated brass. Put a little more wood 
on the fire; you make me cold." Nino obeyed. 

" How literal you are ! " said the baroness petulantly. "There is fire enough, on the hearth." 

" Apparently, signora, you are pleased to be enigmatical," said Nino. 

"I will be pleased to be anything I please," she 
answered, and looked at him rather fiercely. "I 



 

wanted you to drive away my headache, and you 
only make it worse." 

"I am sorry, signora. I will leave you at once. 
Permit me to wish you a very good-morning." 

He took his hat and went towards the door. Be 
fore he reached the heavy curtain, she was at his side 
with a rush like a falcon on the wing, her eyes burn 
ing darkly between anger and love. 

" Nino ! " She laid hold of his arm, and looked 
into his face. 

"Signora," he protested coldly, and drew back. 

"You will not leave me so?" 

"As you wish, signora. I desire to oblige you." 

" Oh, how cold you are ! " she cried, leaving his 
arm, and sinking into a chair by the door, while he 
stood with his hand on the curtain. She hid her 
eyes. "Nino, Nino I You will break my heart! " she 
sobbed; and a tear, perhaps more of anger than of 
sorrow, burst through her fingers, and coursed down 
her cheek. 

Few men can bear to see a woman shed tears. 
Nino's nature rose up in his throat, and bade him 
console her. But between him and her was a fair, 
bright image that forbade him to move hand or 
foot. 

"Signora," he said, with all the calm he could 
command, " if I were conscious of having by word or 
deed of mine given you cause to speak thus, I would 
humbly implore your forgiveness. But my heart 
does not accuse me. I beg you to allow me to take 
leave of you. I will go away, and you shall have no 
further cause to think of me." 



 

He moved again, and lifted the curtain. But she 
was like a panther, so quick and beautiful. Ah, 
how I could have loved that woman ! She held him, 
and would not let him go, her smooth fingers fasten 
ing round his wrists like springs. 

"Please to let me go," he said between his teeth, 
with rising anger. 

" No ! I will not let you ! " she cried fiercely, 
tightening her grasp on him. Then the angry fire in 
her tearful eyes seemed suddenly to melt into a soft 
flame, and the colour came faster to her cheeks. " Ah, 
how can you let me so disgrace myself! how can you 
see me fallen so low as to use the strength of my 
hands, and yet have no pity! Nino, Nino, do not 
kill me!" 

"Indeed, it would be the better for you if I 
should," he answered bitterly, but without attempting to free his wrists from her strong, soft grip. 

"But you will," she murmured passionately. 
" You are killing me by leaving me. Can you not 
see it?" 

Her voice melted away in the tearful cadence. 
But Nino stood gazing at her as stonily as though 
he were the Sphinx. How could he have the heart? 
I cannot tell. Long she looked into his eyes, silently ; 
but she might as well have tried to animate a piece 
of iron, so stern and hard he was. Suddenly, with 
a strong, convulsive movement, she flung his hands 
from her. 

" Go ! " she cried hoarsely. " Go to that wax doll 
you love, and see whether she will love you, or care 
whether you leave her or not ! Go, go, go ! Go to 



 

her! " She had sprung far back from him, and now 
pointed to the door, drawn to her full height and 
blazing in her wrath. 

" I would advise you, madam, to speak with proper 
respect of any lady with whom you choose to couple 
my name." 

His lips opened and shut mechanically, and he 
trembled from head to foot. 

" Respect ! " She laughed wildly. " Respect for a 
mere child whom you happen to fancy! Respect, 
indeed, for anything you choose to do !  I respect Hedwig von Lira? Ha! ha!" And she rested 
her hand on the table behind her, as she laughed. 

"Be silent, madam," said Nino, and he moved a 
step nearer, and stood with folded arms. 

"Ah! You would silence me now, would you? 
You would rather not hear me speak of your mid 
night serenades, and your sweet letters dropped from 
the window of her room, at your feet?" But her rage overturned itself, and with a strange cry she 
fell into a deep chair, and wept bitterly, burying her 
face in her two hands. "Miserable woman that I 
am! " she sobbed, and her whole lithe body was convulsed. 

"You are indeed," said Nino, and he turned once 
more to go. But as he turned, the servant threw 
back the curtain. 

"The Signor Conte di Lira," he announced in dis 
tinct tones. For a moment there was a dead silence, 
during which, in spite of his astonishment at the 
sudden appearance of the count, Nino had time 
to reflect that the baroness had caused him to be 



 

watched during the previous night. It might well 
be, and the mistake she made in supposing the thing 
Hedwig had dropped to be a letter told him that 
her spy had not ventured very near. 

The tall count came forward under the raised cur 
tains, limping and helping himself with his stick. 
His face was as grey and wooden as ever, but his 
moustaches had an irritated, crimped look, that Nino 
did not like. The count barely nodded to the young 
man, as he stood aside to let the old gentleman pass ; 
his eyes turned mechanically to where the baroness 
sat. She was a woman who had no need to stimulate 
passion in any shape, and it must have cost her a terrible effort to control the paroxysm of anger and 
shame and grief that had overcome her. There was 
something unnatural and terrifying in her sudden 
calm, as she forced herself to rise and greet her visitor. 

"I fear I come out of season," he said, apologeti 
cally, as he bent over her hand. 

"On the contrary," she answered; "but forgive 
me if I speak one word to Professor Cardegna." She 
went to where Nino was standing. 

" Go into that room," she said, in a very low voice, 
glancing towards a curtained door opposite the windows, "and wait till he goes. You may listen if 
you choose." She spoke authoritatively. 

"I will not," answered Nino, in a determined 
whisper. 

"You will not?" Her eyes flashed again. He 
shook his head. 

"Count von Lira," she said aloud, turning to 
him, " do you know this young man ? " 



 

She spoke in Italian, and Von Lira answered in 
the same language; but as what he said was not 
exactly humorous, I will spare you the strange construction of his sentences. 

"Perfectly," he answered. "It is precisely concerning this young man that I desire to speak with 
you." The count remained standing because the 
baroness had not told him to be seated. 

"That is fortunate," replied the baroness, "for I 
wish to inform you that he is a villain, a wretch, a 
miserable fellow! " 

Her anger was rising again, but she struggled to 
control it. When Nino realised what she said, he 
came forward, and stood near the count, facing the 
baroness, his arms folded on his breast, as though 
to challenge accusation. The count raised his eye 
brows. 

"I am aware that he concealed his real profession 
so long as he gave my daughter lessons. That, how 
ever, has been satisfactorily explained, though I 
regret it. Pray inform me why you designate him 
as a villain." Nino felt a thrill of sympathy for this 
man whom he had so long deceived. 

"This man, sir," said she in measured tones, "this 
low-born singer, who has palmed himself off on us 
as a respectable instructor in language, has the audacity to love your daughter. For the sake of press 
ing his odious suit, he has wormed himself into 
your house, as into mine ; he has sung beneath your 
daughter's window, and she has dropped letters to 
him, love-letters, do you understand? And now," 
her voice rose more shrill and uncontrollable at 



 

every word, as she saw Lira's face turn white, and 
her anger gave desperate utterance to the lie, 
" and now he has the effrontery to come to me to 
me to me of all women and to confess his abom 
inable passion for that pure angel, imploring me to 
assist him in bringing destruction upon her and you. 
Oh, it is execrable, it is vile, it is hellish! " 

She pressed her hands to her temples as she stood, 
and glared at the two men. The count was a strong 
man, easily petulant, but hard to move to real anger. 
Though his face was white and his right hand clutched 
his crutch-stick, he still kept the mastery of himself. 

"Is what you tell me true, madam?" he asked in 
a strange voice. 

"Before God, it is true! " she cried desperately. 

The old man looked at her for one moment, and 
then, as though he had been twenty years younger, 
he made at Nino, brandishing his stick to strike. 
But Nino is strong and young, and he is almost a 
Roman. He foresaw the count's action, and his 
right hand stole to the table, and grasped the clean, 
murderous knife; the baroness had used it so innocently to cut the leaves of her book, half an hour 
before. With one wrench he had disarmed the elder 
man, forced him back upon a lounge, and set the 
razor edge of his weapon against the count's throat. 

" If you speak one word, or try to strike me, I will 
cut off your head," he said quietly, bringing his 
cold, marble face close down to the old man's eyes. 
There was something so deathly in his voice, in spite 
of its quiet sound, that the count thought his hour 
was come, brave man as he was. The baroness tottered back against the opposite wall, and stood star 
ing at the two, disheveled and horrified. 

"This woman," said Nino, still holding the cold 
thing against the flesh, "lies in part, and in part 
tells the truth. I love your daughter, it is true." 
The poor old man quivered beneath Nino's weight, 
and his eyes rolled wildly, searching for some means 
of escape. But it was of no use. "I love her, and 
have sung beneath her window; but I never had a 
written word from her in my life, and I neither told 
this woman of my love nor asked her assistance. 
She guessed it at the first; she guessed the reason 
of my disguise, and she herself offered to help me. 
You may speak now. Ask her." 

Nino relaxed his hold, and stood off, still grasping the knife. The old count breathed, shook him 
self and passed his handkerchief over his face before 
he spoke. The baroness stood as though she were 
petrified. 

" Thunder-weather, you are a devilish young man ! " 
said Von Lira, still panting. Then he suddenly recovered his dignity. " You have caused me to assault 
this young man, by what you told me," he said, struggling to his feet. " He defended himself, and might 
have killed me, had he chosen. Be good enough to 
tell me whether he has spoken the truth, or you." 

"He has spoken the truth," answered the baron 
ess, staring vacantly about her. Her fright had 
taken from her even the faculty of lying. Her voice 
was low, but she articulated the words distinctly. 
Then, suddenly, she threw up her hands, with a 
short, quick scream, and fell forward, senseless, on 



 

the floor. Nino looked at the count, and dropped 
his knife on a table. The count looked at Nino. 

"Sir," said the old gentleman, "I forgive you for 
resisting my assault. I do not forgive you for presuming to love my daughter, and I will find means 
to remind you of the scandal you have brought on 
my house." He drew himself up to his full height. 
Nino handed him his crutch-stick civilly. 

"Signor Conte," he said, simply, but with all his 
natural courtesy, " I am sorry for this affair, to which 
you forced me, or rather the Signora Baronessa 
forced us both. I have acted foolishly, perhaps, but 
I am in love. And permit me to assure you, sir, that 
I will yet marry the Signorina di Lira, if she consents to marry me." 

"By the name of Heaven," swore the old count, 
"if she wants to marry a singer, she shall." 

He limped to the door in sullen anger, and went 
out. Nino turned to the prostrate figure of the poor 
baroness. The continued strain on her nerves had 
broken her down, and she lay on the floor in a dead 
faint. Nino put a cushion from the lounge under 
her head, and rang the bell. The servant appeared 
instantly. 

"Bring water quickly! " he cried. "The signora 
has fainted." He stood looking at the senseless figure 
of the woman, as she lay across the rich Persian rugs 
that covered the floor. 

" Why did you not bring salts, cologne, her maid 
run, I tell you! " he said to the man, who brought 
the glass of water on a gilded tray. 

He had forgotten that the fellow could not be expected to have any sense. When her people came at 
last, he had sprinkled her face, and she had unconsciously swallowed enough of the water to have some 
effect in reviving her. She began to open her eyes, 
and her fingers moved nervously. Nino found his 
hat, and, casting one glance round the room that had 
just witnessed such strange doings, passed through 
the door and went out. The baroness was left with 
her servants. Poor woman! She did very wrong, 
perhaps, but anybody would have loved her except 
Nino. She must have been terribly shaken, one 
would have thought, and she ought to have gone to 
lie down, and should have sent for the doctor to bleed 
her. But she did nothing of the kind. 

She came to see me. I was alone in the house, 
late in the afternoon, when the sun was just gilding 
the tops of the houses. I heard the doorbell ring, 
and I went to answer it myself. There stood the 
beautiful baroness, alone, with all her dark soft things 
around her, as pale as death, and her eyes swollen 
sadly with weeping. Nino had come home and told 
me something about the scene in the morning, and I 
can tell you I gave him a piece of my mind about his 
follies. 

" Does Professor Cornelio Grandi live here ? " she 
asked, in a low voice. 

" I am he, signora," I answered. " Will you please 
to come in ? " 

And so she came into our little sitting-room, and 
sat over there in the old green arm-chair. I shall 
never forget it as long as I livo. 

I cannot tell you all she said in that brief half- 



 

hour, for it pains me to think of it. She spoke as 
though I were her confessor, so humbly and quietly, 
as though it had all happened ten years ago. There 
is no stubbornness in those tiger women when once 
they break down. 

She said she was going away; that she had done 
my boy a great wrong, and wished to make such reparation as she could by telling me, at least, the truth. 
She did not scruple to say that she had loved him, nor 
that she had done everything in her power to keep 
him ; though he had never so much as looked at her, 
she added pathetically. She wished to have me 
know exactly how it had happened, no matter what I 
might think of her. 

"You are a nobleman, count," she said to me at 
last, " and I can trust you as one of my own people, 
I am sure. Yes, I know : you have been unfortunate, 
and are now a professor. But that does not change 
the blood. I can trust you. You need not tell him 
I came, unless you wish it. I shall never see him 
again. I am glad to have been here, to see where he 
lives." 

She rose, and moved to go. I confess that the 
tears were in my eyes. There was a pile of music 
on the old piano. There was a loose leaf on the top, 
with his name written on it. She took it in her 
hand, and looked inquiringly at me out of her sad 
eyes. I knew she wanted to take it, and I nodded. 

"I shall never see him again, you know." Her 
voice was gentle and weak, and she hastened to the 
door; so that almost before I knew it she was gone. 

The sun had left the red-tiled roofs opposite, and 



 

the goldfinch was silent in his cage. So I sat down 
in the chair where she had rested, and folded my 
hands, and thought, as I am always thinking ever 
since, how I could have loved such a woman as that; 
so passionate, so beautiful, so piteously sorry for 
what she had done that was wrong. Ah me, for the 
years that are gone away so cruelly, for the days so 
desperately dead! Give me but one of those golden 
days, and I would make the pomp of emperors ridiculous. A greater man than I said that, a man 
over the seas, with a great soul, who wrote in a 
foreign tongue, but spoke a language germain to all 
human speech. But even he cannot bring back one 
of those dear days. I would give much to have that 
one day back, when she came and told me all her 
woes. But that is impossible. 

When they came to wake her in the morning the 
very morning after that she was dead in her bed; 
the colour gone for ever from those velvet cheeks, the 
fire quenched out of those passionate eyes, past power 
of love or hate to rekindle. Requiescat in pace, and 
may God give her eternal rest and forgiveness for all 
her sins. Poor, beautiful, erring woman! 



 



CHAPTER IX. 

AT nine o clock on the morning of the baroness's 
death, as Nino was busy singing scales, there was a 
ring at the door, and presently Mariuccia came run 
ning in as fast as her poor old legs could carry her, 
and whiter than a pillow-case, to say that there was 
a man at the door with two gendarmes, asking for 
Nino ; and before I could question her, the three men 
walked unbidden into the room, demanding which 
was Giovanni Cardegna, the singer. Nino started, 
and then said quietly that he was the man. I have 
had dealings with these people, and I know what is 
best to be done. They were inclined to be rough and 
very peremptory. I confess I was frightened; but I 
think I am more cunning when I am a little afraid. 

"Mariuccia," I said, as she stood trembling in the 
doorway, waiting to see what should happen, " fetch 
a flask of that old wine, and serve these gentlemen, 
and a few chestnuts, if you have some. Be seated, 
signori," I said to them, "and take one of these 
cigars. My boy is a singer, and you would not hurt 
his voice by taking him out so early on this raw 
morning. Sit down, Nino, and ask these gentlemen 
what they desire." 

They all sat down, somewhat sullenly, and the 
gendarmes sabres clanked on the brick floor. 



 

" What do you wish from me ? " asked Nino, who 
was not much moved after the first surprise. 

"We regret to say," answered the man in plain 
clothes, "that we are here to arrest you." 

" May I inquire on what charge ? " I asked. " But 
first let me fill your glasses. Dry throats make 
surly answers, as the proverb says." They drank. 
It chanced that the wine was good, being from my 
own vineyard, my little vineyard that I bought 
outside of Porta Salara, and the men were cold and 
wet, for it was raining. 

"Well," said the man who had spoken before, he 
was clean-shaved and fat, and he smacked his lips 
over the wine, " it is not our way to answer ques 
tions. But since you are so civil, I will tell you 
that you are arrested on suspicion of having poisoned 
that Russian baroness, with the long name, at whose 
house you have been so intimate." 

"Poisoned? The baroness poisoned? Is she very 
ill, then ? " asked Nino, in great alarm. 

"She is dead," said the fat man, wiping his mouth, 
and twisting the empty glass in his hand. 

"Dead! " cried Nino and I together. 

" Dead yes ; as dead as St. Peter, " he answered 
irreverently. "Your wine is good, Signor Professore. Yes, I will take another glass and my men, 
too. Yes, she was found dead this morning, lying 
in her bed. You were there yesterday, Signor Cardegna, and her servant says he saw you giving her 
something in a glass of water." He drank a long 
draught. " You would have done better to give her 
some of this wine, my friend. She would certainly 



 

be alive to-day." But Nino was dark and thought 
ful. He must have been pained and terribly shocked 
at the sudden news, of course, but he did not admire 
her as I did. 

"Of course this thing will soon be over," he said 
at last. "I am very much grieved to hear of the 
lady's death, but it is absurd to suppose that I was 
concerned in it, however it happened. She fainted 
suddenly in the morning when I was there, and I 
gave her some water to drink, but there was nothing 
in it." He clasped his hands on his knee, and looked 
much distressed. 

"It is quite possible that you poisoned her," remarked the fat man, with annoying indifference. 
" The servant says he overheard high words between 
you"

"He overheard?" cried Nino, springing to his 
feet. "Cursed beast, to listen at the door!" He 
began to walk about excitedly. " How long is this 
affair to keep me ? " he asked suddenly. " I have to 
sing to-night and that poor lady lying there dead 
oh, I cannot! " 

"Perhaps you will not be detained more than a 
couple of hours," said the fat man. "And perhaps 
you will be detained until the Day of Judgment," 
he added, with a sly wink at the gendarmes, who 
laughed obsequiously. " By this afternoon, the doctors will know of what she died ; and if there was no 
poison, and she died a natural death, you can go to 
the theatre and sing, if you have the stomach. I 
would, I am sure. You see, she is a great lady, and 
the people of her embassy are causing everything to 



 

be done very quickly. If you had poisoned that old 
lady who brought us this famous wine a minute ago, 
you might have had to wait till next year, innocent 
or guilty." It struck me that the wine was producing its effect. 

"Very well," said Nino, resolutely; "let us go. 
You shall see that I am perfectly ready, although the 
news has shaken me much ; and so you will permit 
me to walk quietly with you, without attracting any 
attention ? " 

"Oh, we would not think of incommoding you," 
said the fat man. "The orders were expressly to 
give you every convenience, and we have a private 
carriage below. Signer Grandi, we thank you for 
your civility. Good-morning a thousand excuses. " 

He bowed, and the gendarmes rose to their feet, 
refreshed and ruddy with the good wine. Of course 
I knew I could not accompany them, and I was too 
much frightened to have been of any use. Poor 
Mariuccia was crying in the kitchen. 

" Send word to Jacovacci, the manager, if you do 
not hear by twelve o clock," Nino called back from 
the landing, and the door closed behind them all. 
I was left alone, sad and frightened, and I felt very 
old, much older than I am. 

It was tragic. Mechanically I sank into the old 
green arm-chair, where she had sat but yesterday 
evening, she whom I had seen but twice, once in 
the theatre and once here, but of whom I had heard 
so much. And she was dead, so soon. If Nino 
could only have heard her last words and seen her 
last look, he would have been more hurt when he 



 

heard of her sudden death. But he is of stone, that 
man, save for his love and his art. He seems to 
have no room left for sympathy with human ills, nor 
even for fear on his own account. Fear! how I 
hate the word ! Nino did not seem frightened at all, 
when they took him away. But as for me well, it 
was not for myself this time, at least. That is some 
comfort. I think one may be afraid for other people. 
Mariuccia was so much disturbed that I was obliged 
to go myself to get De Pretis, who gave up all his 
lessons that day and came to give me his advice. He 
looked grave and spoke very little, but he is a broad- 
shouldered, genial man, and very comforting. He 
insisted on going himself at once to see Nino, to give 
him all the help he could. He would not hear of my 
going, for he said I ought to be bled and have some 
tea of mallows to calm me. And when I offered him 
a cigar from the box of good ones Nino had given me, 
he took six or seven, and put them into his pocket 
without saying a word. But I did not grudge them 
of him ; for though he is very ridiculous, with his 
skull-cap and his snuff-box, he is a leal man, as we 
say, who stands by his friends and snaps his fingers 
at the devil. 

I cannot describe to you the anxiety I felt through 
all that day. I could not eat, nor drink, nor write. 
I could not smoke, and when I tried to go to sleep 
that cat an apoplexy on her ! climbed up on my 
shoulder and clawed my hair. Mariuccia sat moan 
ing in the kitchen, and could not cook at all, so that 
I was half starved. 

At three o clock De Pretis came back. 



 

"Courage, conte mio!" he cried; and I knew it 
was all right. " Courage ! Nino is at liberty again, 
and says he will sing to-night to show them he is not 
a clay doll, to be broken by a little knocking about. 
Ah, what a glorious boy Nino is ! " 

"But where is he?" I asked, when I could find 
voice to speak, for I was all trembling. 

" He is gone for a good walk, to freshen his nerves, 
poverino. I wonder he has any strength left. For 
Heaven's sake, give me a match that I may light my 
cigar, and then I will tell you all about it. Thank 
you. And I will sit down, comfortably so. Now 
you must know that the baroness requiescat ! 
was not poisoned by Nino, nor by anyone else." 

" Of course not! Go on." 

"Piano, slow and sure. They had a terrific 
scene yesterday. You know ? Yes. Then she went 
out and tired herself, poor soul, so that when she 
got home she had an attack of the nerves. Now 
these foreigners, who are a pack of silly people, do 
not have themselves bled and drink malva water as 
we do when we get a fit of anger. But they take 
opium; that is, a thing they call chloral. God 
knows what it is made of, but it puts them to sleep, 
like opium. When the doctors came to look at the 
poor lady, they saw at once what was the matter, and 
called the maid. The maid said her mistress certainly had some queer stuff in a little bottle, which 
she often used to take; and when they inquired 
further they heard that the baroness had poured out 
much more than usual the night before, while the 
maid was combing her hair, for she seemed terribly 



 

excited and restless. So they got the bottle and 
found it nearly empty. Then the doctors said, At 
what time was this young man who is now arrested 
seen to give her the glass of water ? The man-servant said it was about two in the afternoon. So the 
doctors knew that if Nino had given her the chloral 
she could not have gone out afterwards, and have 
been awake at eleven in the evening when her maid 
was with her, and yet have been hurt by what he 
gave her. And so, as Jacovacci was raising a thousand devils in every corner of Rome because they 
had arrested his principal singer on false pretences, 
and was threatening to bring suits against everybody, 
including the Russian embassy, the doctors, and the 
government, if Nino did not appear in Faust to 
night, according to his agreement, the result was 
that, half an hour ago, Nino was conducted out of the 
police precincts with ten thousand apologies, and put 
into the arms of Jacovacci, who wept for joy, and 
carried him off to a late breakfast at Morteo's. And 
then I came here. But I made Nino promise to take 
a good walk for his digestion, since the weather has 
changed. For a breakfast at three in the afternoon 
may be called late, even in Rome. And that reminds 
me to ask you for a drop of wine ; for I am still fasting, and this talking is worse for the throat than a 
dozen high masses." 

Mariuccia had been listening at the door, as usual, 
and she immediately began crying for joy; for she is 
a weak-minded old thing, and dotes on Nino. I was 
very glad myself, I can tell you ; but I could not understand how Nino could have the heart to sing, or 



 

should lack heart so much as to be fit for it. Before 
the evening he came home, silent and thoughtful. I 
asked him whether he were not glad to be free so 
easily. 

" That is not a very intelligent question for a philosopher like you to ask," he answered. "Of course 
I am glad of my liberty ; any man would be. But I 
feel that I am as much the cause of that poor lady's 
death as though I had killed her with my own hands. 
I shall never forgive myself." 

"Diana! " I cried, "it is a horrible tragedy; but it 
seems to me that you could not help it if she chose to 
love you." 

"Hush!" said he, so sternly that he frightened 
me. " She is dead. God give her soul rest. Let us 
not talk of what she did." 

"But," I objected, "if you feel so strongly about 
it, how can you sing at the opera to-night? " 

" There are plenty of reasons why I should sing. 
In the first place, I owe it to my engagement with 
Jacovacci. He has taken endless trouble to have me cleared at once, and I will not disappoint him. Besides, I have not lost my voice, and might be half 
ruined by breaking contract so early. Then, the 
afternoon papers are full of the whole affair, some 
right and some wrong, and I am bound to show the 
Contessina di Lira that this unfortunate accident 
does not touch my heart, however sorry I may be. 
If I did not appear, all Rome would say it was 
because I was heart-broken. If she does not go to the 
theatre, she will at least hear of it. Therefore I will 
sing." It was very reasonable of him to think so. 



 

" Have any of the papers got hold of the story of 
your giving lessons ? " 

" No, I think not ; and there is no mention of the 
Lira family." 

"So much the better." 

Hedwig did not go to the opera. Of course she 
was quite right. However she might feel about the 
baroness, it would have been in the worst possible 
taste to go to the opera the very day after her death. 
That is the way society puts it. It is bad taste ; they 
never say it is heartless, or unkind, or brutal. It is 
simply bad taste. Nino sang, on the whole, better 
than if she had been there, for he put his whole soul 
in his art, and won fresh laurels. When it was over 
he was besieged by the agent of the London manager 
to come to some agreement. 

"I cannot tell yet," he said. "I will tell you 
soon." He was not willing to leave Rome, that 
was the truth of the matter. He thought of nothing, 
day or night, but of how he might see Hedwig, and 
his heart writhed in his breast when it seemed more 
and more impossible. He dared not risk compromising her by another serenade, as he felt sure that it 
had been some servant of the count who had betrayed 
him to the baroness. At last he hit upon a plan. 
The funeral of the baroness was to take place on the 
afternoon of the next day. He felt sure that the 
Graf von Lira would go to it, and he was equally 
certain that Hedwig would not. It chanced to be 
the hour at which De Pretis went to the Palazzo to 
give her the singing lesson. 

"I suppose it is a barbarous thing for me to do," 



 

he said to himself, " but I cannot help it. Love first, 
and tragedy afterwards." 

In the afternoon, therefore, he sallied out, and 
went boldly to the Palazzo Carmandola. He inquired 
of the porter whether the Signer Conte had gone out, 
and just as he had expected, so he found it. Old 
Lira had left the house ten minutes earlier, to go to 
the funeral. Nino ran up the stairs and rang the 
bell. The footman opened the door, and Nino quickly 
slipped a five-franc note into his hand, which he had 
no difficulty in finding. On being asked if the signo-rina were at home, the footman nodded, and added 
that Professor De Pretis was with her, but she would 
doubtless see Professor Cardegna as well. And so 
it turned out. He was ushered into the great drawing-room, where the piano was. Hedwig came for 
ward a few steps from where she had been standing 
beside De Pretis, and Nino bowed low before her. 
She had on a long dark dress, and no ornament what 
ever, save her beautiful bright hair, so that her face 
was like a jewel set in gold and velvet. But, when 
I think of it, such a combination would seem absurdly 
vulgar by the side of Hedwig von Lira. She was so 
pale and exquisite and sad that Nino could hardly 
look at her. He remembered that there were violets, 
rarest of flowers in Rome in January, in her belt. 

To tell the truth, Nino had expected to find her 
stern and cold, whereas she was only very quiet and 
sorrowful. 

"Will you forgive me, signorina, for this rash 
ness?" he asked in a low voice. 

"In that I receive you I forgive you, sir," she said. 



 

He glanced toward De Pretis, who seemed absorbed 
in some music at the piano and was playing over bits 
of an accompaniment. She understood, and moved 
slowly to a window at the other end of the great room, 
standing among the curtains. He placed himself in 
the embrasure. She looked at him long and ear 
nestly, as if finally reconciling the singer with the 
man she had known so long. She found him 
changed, as I had, in a short time. His face was 
sterner and thinner and whiter than before, and there 
were traces of thought in the deep shadows beneath 
his eyes. Quietly observing him, she saw how perfectly simple and exquisitely careful was his dress, 
and how his hands bespoke that attention which only 
a gentleman gives to the details of his person. She 
saw that, if he were not handsome, he was in the last 
degree striking to the eye, in spite of all his simplicity, and that he would not lose by being compared
