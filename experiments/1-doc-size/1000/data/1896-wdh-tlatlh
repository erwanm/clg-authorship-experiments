"Did I turn you out of my class ? " 

" Not just in so many words, but when I said I 
couldn't do anything in art, you didn't insist that it 
was because I wouldn't, and of course then I had to 
go. I've never forgiven you, Mr. Westover, never ! 
I>o keep on talking very excitedly ; there's a man com- 
ing up to us that I don't want to think T see him, or 
he'll stop. There ! He's veered off ! Where were 
you, Mr. Westover?" 

" Ah, Miss Bessie," said the painter, delighted at 
her drama. " There isn't anything you couldn't do if 
you would." 

" You mean parlor entertainments ; impersonations ; 
impressions ; that sort of thing ? I have thought of it. 
But it would be too easy. I want to try something 
difficult." 

" For instance." 

" Well, being very, very good. I want something 
that would really tax my powers. I should like to be 



 

an example. I tried it the other night just before I 
went to sleep, and it was fine. I became an example 
to others. But when I woke up — I went on in the 
old way. I want something hard, don't you know ; 
but I want it to be easy ! " 

She laughed, and Westover said : " I am glad you're 
not serious. No one ought to be an example to others. 
To be exemplary is as dangerous as to be compliment- 
ary." 

" It certainly isn't so agreeable to the object," said 
the girl. " But it's fine for the subject as long as it 
lasts. How metaphysical we're getting ! The object- 
ive and the subjective. It's quite what I should expect 
of talk at a Boston dance if I were a New-Yorker. 
Have you seen anything of my brother, within the last 
hour or so, Mr. Westover?" 

" Yes; I just left him in the supper-room. Shall I 
go get him for you ? " When he had said this, with 
the notion of rescuing him from Jeff, Westover was 
sorry, for he doubted if Alan Lynde were any longer 
in the state to be brought away from the supper-room, 
and he was glad to have Bessie say : 

" No, no. He'll look us up in the course of the 
evening — or the morning." 

A young fellow came to claim her for a dance, and 
Westover had not the face to leave Miss Lynde, all 
the less because she told him he must not think of 
staying. He stayed till the dance was over, and 
Bessie came back to him. 

" What time is it, Mr. Westover ? I see my aunt 
beginning to nod on her perch." 



 

Westover looked at his watcli. " It's ten minutes 
past two." 

" How early ! " sighed the girl. " I'm tired of it, 
aren't you?" 

" Very," said Westover. " I was tired an hour 
ago." 

Bessie sank back in her chair with an air of nervous 
collapse, and did not say anything. "Westover saw 
her watching the young couples who passed in and out 
of the room where the dancing was, or found corners 
on sofas, or window-seats, or sheltered spaces beside 
the doors and the chimney-piece, the girls panting and 
the men leaning forward to fan them. She looked 
very tired of it; and when a young fellow came up 
and asked her to dance, she told him that she was 
provisionally engaged. " Come back and get me, if 
you can't do better," she said, and he answered there 
was no use trying to do better, and said he would wait 
till the other man turned up, or didn't, if she would 
let him. He sat down beside her, and some young 
talk began between them. 

In the midst of it JefE appeared. He looked at 
Westover first, and then approached with an embar- 
rassed face. 

Bessie got vividly to her feet. " No apologies, Mr. 
Durgin, please ! But in just another moment you'd 
have lost your dance." 

Westover saw what he believed a change pass in 
JefE's look from embarrassment to surprise and then 
to flattered intelligence. He beamed all over; and he 
went away with Bessie towards the ballroom, and left 



 

Westover to a wholly unsupported belief that she had 
not been engaged to dance with JefE. He wondered 
what her reckless meaning could be, but he had al- 
ways thought her a young lady singularly fitted by 
nature and art to take care of herself, and when he 
reasoned upon what was in his mind he had to own 
that there was no harm in JefE's dancing with her. 

He took leave of Miss Lynde, and was going to get 
his coat and hat for his walk home when he was mys- 
teriously stopped in a corner of the stairs by one of 
the caterer's men whom he knew. It is so unnatural 
to be addressed by a servant at all unless he asks you 
if you will have something to eat or drink, that West- 
over was in a manner prepared to have him say some- 
thing startling. " It's about young Mr. Lynde, sor. 
We've got um in one of the rooms up-stairs, but he 
ain't fit to go home alone, and I've been lookin' for 
somebody that knows the family to help get um into 
a car'ge. He won't go for anny of us, sor." 

" Where is he ? " asked Westover, in anguish at be- 
ing unable to refuse the appeal, but loathing the ofiice 
put upon him. 

" I'll show you, sor," said the caterer's man, and he 
sprang up the stairs before Westover, with glad alac- 
rity. 



XXXIII. 

In a little room at the side of that where the men's 
hats and coats were checked, Alan Lynde sat drooping 
forward in an arm-chair, with his head fallen on his 
breast. He roused himself at the flash of the burner 
which the man turned up. " What's all this ? " he de- 
manded, haughtily. " Where's the carriage ? What's 
the matter ? " 

" Your carriage is waiting, Lynde," said Westover. 
" I'll see you down to it," and he murmured hope- 
lessly to the caterer's man, " Is there any back way ? " 

" There's the wan we got um up by." 

" It will do," said Westover, as simply. 

But - Lynde called out defiantly : " Back way ; I 
sha'n't go down back way. Inshult to guest. I wish 
— say — good-night to — Mrs. Enderby. Who you, 
anyway ? Damn caterer's man ? " 

" I'm Westover, Lynde," the painter began, but the 
young fellow broke in upon him, shaking his hand and 
then taking his arm. 

" Oh, Westover ! All right ! I'll go down back 
way with you. Thought — thought it was damn cater- 
er's man. No — ofEense." 



 

" No. It's all right." Westover got his arm under 
Lynde's elbow, and, with the man going before for 
them to fall upon jointly in case they should stumble, 
he got him down the dark and twisting stairs and 
through the basement hall, which was vaguely haunted 
by the dispossessed women servants of the family, and 
so out upon the pavement of the moonlighted streets. 

" Call Miss Lynde's car'ge," shouted the caterer's 
man to the barker, and escaped back into the base- 
ment, leaving Westover to stay his helpless charge on 
the sidewalk. 

It seemed a publication of the wretch's shame when 
the barker began to fill the night with hoarse cries of, 
" Miss Lynde's carriage ; carriage for Miss Lynde ! " 
The cries were taken up by a coachman here and there 
in the rank of vehicles whose varnished roofs shone 
in the moon up and down the street. After a time 
that Westover of course felt to be longer than it was. 
Miss Lynde's old coachman was roused from his sleep 
on the box and started out of the rank. He took in 
the situation with the eye of custom, when he saw 
Alan supported on the sidewalk by a stranger at the 
end of the canopy covering the pavement. 

He said, " Oh, ahl right, sor ! " and when the two 
white-gloved policemen from either side of it helped 
Westover into the carriage with Lynde, he set off at a 
quick trot. The policemen clapped their hands to- 
gether, and smiled across the strip of carpet that sep- 
arated them, and winks and nods of intelligence passed 
among the barkers to the footmen about the curb and 
steps. There were none of them sorry to see a gen- 



 

tleman in that state ; some of them had perhaps seen 
Alan in that state before. 

Half-way home he roused himself and put his hand 
on the carriage-door latch. " Tell the coachman drive 
us to — the — club. Make night of it." 

" No, no," said Westover, trying to restrain him. 
" We'd better go right on to your house." 

" Who — who — who are you ? " demanded Alan. 

" Westover." 

" Oh, yes — Westover. Thought we left Westover 
at Mrs. — Enderby's. Thought it was that jay — 
What's his name ? Durgin. He's awful jay, but civil 
to me, and I want be civil to him. You're not — -jay ? 
No ? That's right. Fellow made me sick ; but I took 
his — champagne ; and I must — show him some — at- 
tention." He released the door-handle, and fell back 
against the cushioned carriage wall. " He's a black- 
guard ! " he said, sourly. " Not — simple jay — black- 
guard, too. No — no — business bring in my sister's 
name, hey ? You — you say it's — Westover ? Oh, yes, 
Westover. Old friend of family. Tell you good joke, 
Westover — my sister's. No more jays for me, no 
more jags for you. That's what she say — just between 
her and me, you know ; she's a lady, Bess is ; knows 
when to use — slang. Mark — mark of a lady know 
when to use — slang. Pretty good — jays and jags. 
Guess we didn't count this time — either of us." 

When the carriage pulled up before Miss Lynde's 
house, Westover opened the door. " You're at home, 
now, Lynde. Come, let's get out." 

Lynde did not stir. He asked Westover again who 



 

he was, and when he had made sure of him, he said, 
with dignity, Very well ; now they must get the other 
fellow. Westover entreated ; he even reasoned ; Lynde 
lay back in the corner of the carriage, and seemed 
asleep. 

Westover thought of pulling him up and getting 
him in-doors by main force. He appealed to the 
coachman to know if they could not do it together. 

" Why, you see, I couldn't leave me harsses, sor," 
said the coachman. " What's he wants, sor ? " He 
bent urbanely down from his box and listened to the 
explanation that Westover made him, standing in the 
cold on the curb-stone, with one hand on the carriage 
door. "Then it's no use, sor," the man decided. 
" Whin he's that way, ahl hell couldn't stir um. Best 
go back, sor, and try to find the gentleman." 

This was in the end what Westover had to do, feel- 
ing all the time that a thing so frantically absurd could 
not be a waking act, but helpless to escape from its 
performance. He thought of abandoning his charge 
and leaving him to his fate when he opened the car- 
riage door before Mrs. Enderby's house ; but with the 
next thought he perceived that this was on all accounts 
impossible. He went in, and began his quest for Jeff, 
sending various serving-men about with vague descrip- 
tions of him, and asking for him of departing guests, 
mostly young men he did not know, but who, he 
thought, might know Jeff. 

He had to take off his overcoat at last, and reappear 
at the ball. The crowd was still great, but visibly less 
dense than it had been. By a sudden inspiration he 



t 

 

made his way to the supper-room, and he found JefE 
there, filling a plate, as if he were about to carry it o£E 
somewhere. He commanded Jefi's instant presence 
in the carriage outside ; he told him of Alan's desire 
for him. 

Jeff leaned back against the wall with the plate in 
his hand and laughed till it half slipped from his hold. 
When he could get his breath, he said : " I'll be back 
in a few minutes ; I've got to take this to Miss Bessie 
Lynde. But I'll be right back." 

Westover hardly believed him. But when he got 
on his own things again, Jeff joined him in his hat 
and overcoat, and they went out together. 

It was another carriage that stopped the way now, 
and once more the barker made the night ring with 
what Westover felt his heartless and shameless cries 
for Miss Lynde's carriage. After a maddening delay, 
it lagged up to the curb and Jeff pulled the door 
open. 

" Hello ! " he said. " There's nobody here ! " 

'Nobody there?" cried Westover, and they fell 
upon the coachman with wild question and reproach ; 
the policeman had to tell him at last that the carriage 
must move on, to make way for others. 

The coachman had no explanation to offer : he did 
not know how or when Mr. Alan had got away. 

" But you can give a guess where he's gone ? " Jeff 
suggested, with a presence of mind which Westover 
mutely admired. 

" Well, sor, I know where he do be gahn, some- 
times," the man admitted. 



" Well, that will do ; take me there," said Jeff. 
" You go in and account for me to Miss Lynde," he 
instructed Westover, across his shoulder. " I'll get 
him home before morning, somehow ; and I'll send the 
carriage right back for the ladies, now." 

Westover had the forethought to decide that Miss 
Bessie should ask for Jeff if she wanted him, and this 
simplified matters very much. She asked nothing 
about him. At sight of Westover coming up to her 
where she sat with her aunt, she merely said, " Why, 
Mr. Westover! I thought you took leave of this 
scene of gayety long ago." 

"Did you?" Westover returned provisionally, and 
she saved him from the sin of framing some deceit in 
final answer by her next question. 

" Have you seen anything of Alan lately ? " she 
asked, in a voice involuntarily lowered. 

Westover replied in the same octave, " Yes, I saw 
him going a good while ago." 

" Oh ! " said the girl. " Then I think my aunt and 
I had better go, too." 

Still she did not go, and there was an interval in 
which she had the air of vaguely waiting. To West- 
over's vision, the young people still passing to and 
from the ballroom were like the painted figures of a 
picture quickened with sudden animation. There were 
scarcely any elders to be seen now, except the chaper- 
ons, who sat in their places with iron fortitude ; West- 
over realized that he was the only man of his age left. 
He felt that the lights ought to have grown dim, but 
the place was as brilliant as ever. A window had been 



 

opened somewliere, and the cold breath of the night 
was drawing through the heated rooms. 

He was content to have Bessie stay on, though he 
was almost dropping with sleep, for he was afraid that 
if she went at once, the carriage might not have got 
back, and the whole afiair must somehow be given 
away ; at last, if she were waiting, she decided to wait 
no longer, and then Westover did not know how to 
keep her. He saw her rise and stoop over her aunt, 
putting her mouth to the elder lady's ear, and he heard 
her saying, " I am going home. Aunt Louisa." She 
turned sweetly to him. " Won't you let us set you 
down, Mr. Westover ? " 

"Why, thank you, I believe I prefer walking. But 
do let me have your carriage called," and again he 
hurried himself into his overcoat and hat, and ran 
down-stairs, and the barker a third time sent forth his 
lamentable cries in summons of Miss Lynde's carriage. 

While he stood on the curb-stone eagerly peering 
up and down the street, he heard, without being able 
either to enjoy or reseut it, one of the policemen say 
across him to the other, " Miss Lynde seems to be do- 
in' a livery-stable business to-night." 

Almost at the moment a carriage drove up, and he 
recognized Miss Lynde's coachman, who recognized 
him. " Just got back, sor," he whispered, and a min- 
ute later Bessie came daintily out over the carpeted 
way with her aunt. 

" How good of you ! " she said, and " Good-night, 
Mr. Westover," said Miss Lynde, with an implication 
in her voice that virtue was peculiarly its own reward 



 

for those who performed any good office for her or 
hers. 

Westover shut them in, the carriage rolled off, and 
he started on his homeward walk with a long sigh of 
relief. 



XXXIV. 

Bessie asked the sleepy man wlio opened her aunt's 
door whether her brother had come in yet, and found 
that he had not. She helped her aunt off up-stairs 
with her maid, and when she came down again she 
sent the man to bed ; she told him she was going to 
sit up and she would let her brother in. The caprices 
of Alan's latch-key were known to all the servants, and 
the man understood what she meant. He said he had 
left a light in the reception-room and there was a fire 
there ; and Bessie tripped on down from the library 
floor, where she had met him. She had put ofE her 
ball dress and had slipped into the simplest and easiest 
of breakfast frocks, which was by no means plain. 
Bessie had no plain frocks for any hour of the day ; 
her frocks all expressed in stuS and style and color, and 
the bravery of their flying laces and ribbons, the audac- 
ity of spirit with which she. was herself chicqued to- 
gether, as she said. This one she had on now was 
something that brightened her dull complexion, and 
brought out the best effect of her eyes and mouth, and 
seemed the effluence of her personal dash and grace. 



 

It made the most of her, and she liked it beyond all 
her other negligees for its complaisance. 

She got a book, and sat down in a long, low chair 
before the fire and crossed her pretty slippers on the 
warm hearth. It was a quarter after three by the clock 
on the mantel ; but she had never felt more eagerly 
awake. The party had not been altogether to her 
mind, up to midnight, but after that it had been a 
series of rapid and vivid emotions, which continued 
themselves still in the tumult of her nerves, and seemed 
to demand an indefinite sequence of experience. She 
did not know what state her brother might be in when 
he came home ; she had not seen anything of him after 
she first went out to supper; till then, though, he had 
kept himself straight, as he needs must ; but she could 
not tell what happened to him afterwards. She hoped 
that he would come home able to talk, for she wished 
to talk. She wished to talk about herself ; and as she 
had already had flattery enough, she wanted some 
truth about herself; she wanted Alan to say what he 
thought of her behavior the whole evening with that 
jay. He must have seen something of it in the be- 
ginning, and she should tell him all the rest. She 
should tell him just how often she had danced with 
the man, and how many dances she had sat .out with 
him ; how she had pretended once that she was en- 
gaged when another man asked her, and then danced 
with the jay, to whom she pretended that he had en- 
gaged her for the dance. She had wished to see how 
he would take it ; for the same reason she ' had given 
to some one else a dance that was really his. She 



 

would tell Alan how the jay had asked her for that 
last dance, and then never come near her again. That 
would give him the whole situation, and she would 
know just what he thought of it. 

What she thought of herself she hardly knew, or 
made believe she hardly knew. She prided herself 
upon not being a flirt ; she might not be very good, as 
goodness went, but she was not despicable, and a flirt 
was despicable. She did not call the audacity of her 
behavior with the jay flirting ; he seemed to understand 
it as well as she, and to meet her in her own spirit ; 
she wondered now whether this jay was really more in- 
teresting than the other men one met, or only different ; 
whether he was original, like Alan himself, or merely 
novel, and would soon wear down to the tiresomeness 
that seemed to underlie them all, and made one 
wish to do something dreadful. In the jay's presence 
she had no wish to do anything dreadful. Was it 
because he was dreadful enough for both, all the time, 
without doing anything ? She would like to ask Alan 
that, and see how he would take it. Nothing seemed 
to put the jay out, so far as she had tried, and she 
had tried some bold impertinences with him. He was 
very jolly through them all, and at the worst of them 
he laughed and asked her for that dance, which he 
never came to claim, though in the meantime he 
brought her some belated supper, and was devoted to 
her and her aunt, inventing services to do for them. 
Then suddenly he went off and did not return, and 
Mr. Westover mysteriously reappeared, and got their 
carriage. 



 

She heard a scratching at the key-hole of the out- 
side door ; she knew it was Alan's latch. She had 
left the inner door ajar that there might be no uncer- 
tainty of hearing him, and she ran out into the space 
between that and the outer door where the fumbling 
and scraping kept on. 

" Is that you, Alan ? " she called, softly, and if she 
had any doubt before, she had none when she heard 
her brother outside, cursing his luck with his key as 
usual. 

She flung the door open, and confronted him with 
another man, who had his arms arouud him as if he 
had caught him from falling with the inward pull of 
the door. Alan got to his feet and grappled with the 
man, and insisted that he should come in and make a 
night of it. 

Bessie saw that it was Jeff, and they stood a mo- 
ment, looking at each other. JefE tried to free himself 
with an appeal to Bessie: "I beg your pardon. Miss 
Lynde. I walked home with your brother, and I was 
just helping him to get in — I didn't think that 
you—" 

Alan said, with his measured distinctness : " No- 
body cares what you think. Come in, and get some- 
thing to carry you over the bridge. Cambridge cars 
stopped running long ago. I say you shall ! " He 
began to raise his voice. A light flashed in a window 
across the way, and a sash was lifted ; some one must 
be looking out. 

" Oh, come in with him ! " Bessie implored, and at 
a little yielding in JeS, her brother added : 

Q 



 

" Come in, you damn jay ! " He pulled at JefE. 

Jefi made haste to shut the door behind them. He 
was laughing ; and if it was from mere brute insensi- 
bility to what would have shocked another in the sit- 
uation, his frank recognition of its grotesqueness jvas 
of better effect than any hopeless effort to ignore it 
woul(J have been. People adjust themselves to their 
trials ; it is the pretence of the witness that there is 
no trial which hurts, and Bessie was not wounded by 
Jeff's laugh. 

"There's a fire here in the reception-room," she 
said. " Can you get him in ? " 

" I guess so." 

Jeff lifted Alan into the room and stayed liim on 
foot there, while he took off his hat and overcoat, and 
then he let him sink into the low easy-chair Bessie 
had just risen from. All the time, Alan was bidding 
her ring and have some champagne and cold meat set 
out on the side-board, and she was lightly promising 
and coaxing. But he drowsed quickly in the warmth, 
and the last demand for supper died half uttered on 
his lips. 

Jeff asked across him : " Can't I get him up-stairs 
for you ? I can carry him." 

She shook her head, and whispered back, " I can 
leave him here," and she looked at Jeff with a mo- 
ment's hesitation.- " Did you — do you think that — 
any one noticed him, at Mrs. Enderby's ? " 

" No; they had got him in a room by himself — the 
caterer's men had." 

" And you found him there ? " 




" Mr. Westover found him there," Jeff answered. 

" I don't understand." 

"Didn't he come to you after I left ? " 

"Yes." 

" I told him to excuse me — " 

" He didn't." 

" Well, I guess he was pretty badly rattled." Jeff 
stopped himself in the vague laugh of one who re- 
members something ludicrous, and turned his face 
away. 

" Tell me what it was ! " she demanded, nervously. 

" Mr. Westover had been home with him once, and 
he wouldn't stay. He made Mr. Westover come back 
for me." 

" What did he want with you ? " 

Jeff shrugged. 

"And then what?" 

" We went out to the carriage, as soon as I could 
get away from you ; but he wasn't in it. I sent Mr. 
Westover back to you and set out to look for him." 

" That was very good of you. And I — thank you 
for your kindness to my brother. I shall not forget 
it. And I wish to beg your pardon." 

"What for?" asked Jeff, bluntly. 

" For blaming you when you didn't come back for 
the dance." 

If Bessie had meant nothing but what was fitting to 
the moment some inherent lightness of nature played 
her false. But even the histrionic touch which she 
could not keep out of her voice, her manner, another 
sort of man might have found merely pathetic. 



 

Jeff laughed with subtle intelligence. " Were you 
very hard on me ? " 

" Very," she answered in kind, forgetting her broth- 
er, and the whole terrible situation. 

" Tell me what you thought of me," he said, and 
he came a little nearer to her, looking very handsome 
and very strong. " I should like to know." 

" I said I should never speak to you again." 

" And you kept your word," said JeflE. " Well, 
that's all right. Good-night — or good-morning, which- 
ever it is." He took her hand, which she could not 
withdraw, or feigned to herself that she could not 
withdraw, and looked at her with a silent laugh, and 
a hardy, sceptical glance that she felt take in every 
detail of her prettiness, her plainness. Then he 
turned and went out, and she ran quickly and locked 
the door upon him. 



XXXV. 

Bessie crept up to her room, where she spent the 
rest of the night in her chair, amidst a tumult of emo- 
tion which she would have called thinking. She asked 
herself the most searching questions, but she got no 
very candid answers to them, and she decided that she 
must see the whole fact with some other's eyes before 
she could know what she had meant or what she had 
done. 

When she let the daylight into her room, it showed 
her a face in her mirror that bore no trace of conflict- 
ing anxieties. Her complexion favored this efEect of 
inward calm ; it was always thick ; and her eyes seemed 
to her all the brighter for their vigils. 

A sm'ile, even, hovered on her mouth as she sat 
down at the breakfast-table, in the pretty negligee she 
had worn all night, and poured out Miss Lynde's cof- 
fee for her. 

" That's always very becoming to you, Bessie," said 
her aunt. " It's the nicest breakfast gown you have." 

" Do you think so ?," Bessie looked down at it, 
first on one side and then on the other, as a woriian 
always does when her dress is spoken of. 

" Mr. Alan said he would have his breakfast in his 



 

room, miss," murmured the butler, in husky respect- 
fulness, as lie returned to Bessie from carrying Miss 
Lynde's cup to lier. " He don't want anything but a 
little toast and coflEee." 

She perceived that the words were meant to make 
it easy for her to ask, " Isn't he very well, Andrew ? " 

" About as usual, miss," said Andrew, a thought 
more sepulchral than before. " He's going on — about 
as usual." 

She knew this to mean that he was going on from 
bad to worse, and that his last night's exceSs was the 
beginning of a debauch which could, end only in one 
way. She must send for the doctor ; he would decide 
what was best, when he saw how Alan came through 
the day. 

Late in the afternoon she heard Mary Enderby's 
voice in the reception-room, bidding the man say that 
if Miss Bessie were lying down she would come up to 
her, or would go away, just as she wished. She flew 
down-stairs with a glad cry of " Molly ! What an in- 
spiration ! I was just thinking of you, and wishing 
for you. But I didn't suppose you were up yet ! " 

" It's pretty early," said Miss Enderby. " But I 
should have been here before if I could, for I knew I 
shouldn't wake you, Bessie, with your habit of turning 
night into day, and getting up any time in the fore- 
noon." 

" How dissipated you sound ! " 

" Yes, don't I ? But I've been thinking about you 
ever since I woke, and I had to come and find out if 
you were alive, anyhow." 



 

" Come up-stairs and see ! " said Bessie, holding 
her friend's hand on the sofa where they had dropped 
down together, and going all over the scene of last 
night in that place, for the thousandth time. 

" No, no ; I really mustn't. I hope you had a good 
time ? " 

" At your house ! " 

" How dear of you ! But, Bessie, I got to thinking 
you'd been rather sacrificed. It came into my mind 
the instant I woke, and gave me this severe case of 
conscience. I suppose it's a kind of conscience." 

" Yes, yes. Go on ! I like having been a martyr, 
if I don't know what about." 

" Why, you know, Bessie, or if you don't you will 
presently, that it was I who got mamma to send him 
a card ; I felt rather sorry for him, that day at Mrs. 
Bevidge's, because she'd so obviously got him there to 
use him, and I got mamma to ask him. Everything 
takes care of itself, at a large afEair, and I thought I 
might trust in Providence to deal with him after he 
came ; and then I saw you made a means the whole 
evening ! I didn't reflect that there always has to be 
a means ! " 

" It's a question of Mr. Durgin ? " said Bessie, 
coldly thrilling at the sound of a name that she pro- 
nounced so gayly in a tone of sympathetic amusement. 

Miss Enderby bobbed her head. " It shows that 
we ought never to do a good action, doesn't it ? But, 
poor thing ! How you must have been swearing oflE ! " 

" I don't know. Was it so very bad ? I'm trying 
to think," said Bessie, thinking that after this begin- 



 

ning it would be impossible to confide in Mary En- 
derby. 

" Ob, now, Bessie ! Don't you be patient, or I stall 
begin to lose my faith in human nature. Just say at 
once that it was an outrage, and I'll forgive you ! 
You see," Miss Enderby went on, " it isn't merely that 
he's a jay ; but he isn't a very nice jay. None of the 
men like him — except Freddy Lancaster, of course ; 
he likes everybody, on principle ; he doesn't count. I 
thought that perhaps, although he's so crude and 
blunt, he might be sensitive and high-minded ; you're 
always reading about such things; but they say he 
isn't, in the least ; oh, not the least ! They say he 
goes with a set of fast jays, and that he's dreadful ; 
though he has a very good mind, and could do very 
well if he chose. That's what cousin Jim said to-day ; 
he's just been at our house ; and it was so extremely 
telepathic that I thought I must run round and pre- 
vent your having the man on your conscience if you 
felt you had had too much, of him. You wonH lay 
him up against us, will you ? " She jumped to her 
feet. 

" You dear ! " said Bessie, keeping Mary Enderby's 
hand, and pressing it between both of hers against her 
breast as they now stood face to face. " Do come up 
and have some tea ! " 

" No, no ! Eeally, I can't." 

They were both involuntarily silent. The door had 
been opened to some one, and there was a brief parley, 
which ended in a voice they knew to be the doctor's, 
saying, " Then I'll go right up to his room." Both 



 

the girls broke into laughing adieux, to hide their 
consciousness that the doctor was going up to see 
Alan Lynde, who was never sick except in the one 
way. 

Miss Enderby even said, " I was so glad to see Alan 
looking so well, last night." 

" Yes, he had such a good time," said Bessie, and 
she followed her friend to the door, where she kissed 
her reassuringly, and thanked her for taking all the 
trouble she had, bidding her not be the least anxious 
on her account. 

It seemed to her that she should sink upon the stairs 
in mounting them to the library. Mary Enderby had 
told her only what she had known before ; it was what 
her brother had told her ; but then it had not been 
possible for the man to say that he had brought Alan 
home tipsy, and been alone in the house with her at 
three o'clock in the morning. He would not only 
boast of it to all that vulgar eomradehood of his, but 
it might get into those terrible papers, which published 
the society scandals. There would be no way but to 
appeal to his pity, his generosity. She fancied herself 
writing to him, but he could show her note, and she 
must send for him to come and see her, and try to 
put him on his honor. Or, that would not do, either. 
She must make it happen that they should be thrown 
together, and then speak to him. Even that might 
make him think she was afraid of him ; or he might 
take it wrong, and believe that she cared for him. He 
had really been very good to Alan, and she tried to 
feel safe in the thought of that. She did feel safe for 



 

a moment; but if she had. meant notHng but to make 
him believe her grateful, what must he infer from her 
talking to him in the light way she did about forgiving 
him for not coming back to dance with her. Her 
manner, her looks, her tone, had given him the right 
to say that she had been willing to flirt with him there, 
at that hour, and in those dreadful circumstances. 

She found herself lying in a deep arm-chair in the 
library, when she was aware of Dr. Lacy pausing at 
the door and looking tentatively in upon her. 

" Come in, doctor," she said, and she knew that 
her face was wet with tears, and that she spoke with 
the voice of weeping. 

He came forward and looked narrowly at her, with- 
out sitting down. " There's nothing to be alarmed 
about, Miss Bessie," he said. "But I thinjk your 
brother had better leave home again, for a while." 

" Yes," she said, blankly. Her mind Was not on 
bis words. 

" I will make the arrangements." 
" Thank you," said Bessie, listlessly. 
The doctor had made a step backward, as if he were 
going away, and now he stopped. " Aren't you feel- 
ing quite well. Miss Bessie ? " 

" Oh, yes," she said, and she began to cry. 
The doctor came forward, and said, cheerily, " Let 
me see." He pulled a chair up to hers, and took her 
wrist between his fingers. " If you were at Mrs. En- 
derby's last night, you'll need, another night to put 
you just right. But you're pretty well, as it is." He 
let her wrist softly go, and said: "You mustn't dis- 



 

tress yourself about your brother's case. Of course, 
it's hard to have it happen now after he's held up so 
long ; longer than it has been before, I think, isn't it ? 
But it's something that it has been so long. The next 
time, let us hope, it will be longer still." 

The doctor made as if to rise. Bessie put her hand 
out to stay him. " What is it makes him do it ? " 

" Ah, that's a great mystery," said the doctor. " I 
suppose you might say, the excitement." 

"Yes!" 

" But it seems to me very often, in such cases, as 
if it were to escape the excitement. I think you're 
both keyed up pretty sharply by nature. Miss Bessie," 
said the doctor, with the personal kindness he felt for 
the girl, and the pity softening his scientific spirit. 

" I know ! " she answered. " We're alike. Why 
don't I take to drinking, too ? " 

The doctor laughed at such a question from a young 
lady, but with an inner seriousness in his laugh, as if, 
coming from a patient, it was to be weighed. " Well, 
I suppose it isn't the habit of your sex, Miss Bessie." 

" Sometimes it is. Sometimes women get drunk, 
and then I think they do less harm than if they did 
other things to get away from the excitement." She 
longed to confide in him ; the words were on her 
tongue ; she believed he could help her, tell her what 
to do ; out of his stores of knowledge and experience 
he must have some suggestion, some remedy ; he could 
advise her ; he could stand her friend, so far. People 
told their doctors all kinds of things, silly things. 
Why should she not tell her doctor this ? 



 

It would liavo been easier if it had been an older 
man, who might have had a daughter of her ago. But 
he was in that period of the early forties when a doc- 
tor sometimes has a matter-of-fact, disagreeable wife 
whose idea stands between him and the spiritual inti- 
macy of his patients, so that it seems as if they were 
delivering their confidences rather to her than to him. 
He was able, he was good, he was extremely acute, he 
was even with the latest facts and theories ; but as he 
sat straight up in his chair his stomach defined itself 
as a half -moon before him, and he said to the quiver- 
ing heap of emotions beside him, "You mean like
