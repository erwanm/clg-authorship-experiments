longing for the place she will never fill. She cannot now 
be Miss Hilliard's dearest friend, and she has a strange, 
unsatisfied desire to have some one stand in this most 
delightful place to her. 

" Yes, Cynthia needed it," she says. " She has been so 
brave, our mainstay through this unfortunate time. You 
have been very generous to our poor Perdita " — Her 
voice trembles a little. 

"I owed her some reparation, and — you all," he pro- 
ceeds with a slight hesitation. -•' It was my decision that 
brought about this utterly unexpected event. When the 
forgery was first discovered Mr. Sayre appealed to me as 
to what course it was best to pursue. I could not think of 
any reason why the lawful, legal, just method should not 
at once be adopted. In any event, the Bradleys would re- 



 

tain half. It was not because / was grasping " — His 
eager face flushes in his own defence. 

She colors a little, and turns her face slightly, but it 
only serves to bring out the beautiful rounding of cheek 
and chin and the fine slope of the neck. 

" You see," he continues, " Perdita could not have gone 
on with this terrible half-knowledge between them. Mr. 
Sayre's letter and notice only precipitated what must have 
happened a little later. If Perdita belonged to me I should 
be thankful it came so soon, without any more real suffer- 
ing. I shall always take a peculiar interest in her, and if 
there should arise any after-difficulties I hope you will 
allow me to keep a brother's place and authority over her. 
We are all so linked in together, — all human souls, that 
the wrong-doing of one reaches much farther than another 
is apt to imagine." 

" Oh," Begina responds after some consideration. Surely 
she cannot disparage his motives. It is not simply a mat- 
ter affecting her wishes or desires, it is her mother's rights, 
and she would have no prerogative of decision. 

" Well," after a long silence, " have I banned myself out 
forever? Have I brought about an. irreparable misfor- 
tune ? " 

He does not glance her way now. She shall answer 
quite by herself. 

" You did what was right," she returns slowly. " I do 
not see what other step you could have taken, unless the 
far-fetched one of misplaced generosity." 

" Mr. Sayre would have taken it up on your mother's 
behalf. I do not think you could have prevented it in any 
event.. But I am glad " — 

The train is coming in. Both know what the ending of 
the sentence would be, that she is not offended, though he 
must be identified largely with the trouble, and in a cer- 
tain manner it gives him friendly rights which he might 
not have gained otherwise. 

As she is being whirled along the picturesque riverside 
a sentence of Jasper Bradley's recurs to her.  he set 





Cynthia in the place Once offered to her ? She has won it 
fairly. Since all the good gifts of fortune gravitate to her 
— Well, her own life and her own duties are mapped out. 

Norman Winterburne has a strange new light in his eyes 
wlien he returns. They talk over the plans, and he answers 
the proposal they have had under consideration. He will 
make little excursions to them as opportunity oifers, but 
he cannot be absent long at a time. They are to finish 
their preparations with what speed they can, for the summer 
will wane before they have laid in a sufficient supply of 
ozone. To-morrow or the next day he will take Perdita to 
Beverly, as the physician thinks she can stand the removal. 

He sends Alice to bed. Lois has the tea dishes out of 
the way and goes up with her. 

" Come out for a walk," he says to Cynthia in his insist- 
ent man's fashion. " You are getting pale and heavy-eyed, 
and we cannot afford to have you dropping down. You 
-are the chief corner-stone ; " and his face is alight with a 
tender radiance that appears , only in moments of great 
satisfaction. 

Cynthia's pulses speed to a certain delightful thrill. She 
has come to be o« such friendly terms — is it merely 
friendly ? The appreciation touches her. It is so simply 
direct, so honest, with none of the introverted meanings 
that mystify her in some others. 

" You and Regina must have agreed excellently, " she 
says with a mirthful intonation. 

" Why, can you tell when we do not agree ? " he asks 
with nervous apprehension. 

" There is always something in the air. The polarity is 
disturbed. Regina is a circle of attraction and repulsion ; 
that is, some uncomprehended thing, very slight indeed, 
may touch the rim with the power of repulsion. She isn't 
always conscious of it, either. And I know she is trying 
to live outside of it. Complex natures take a long while to 
settle." 

" We were talking of Perdita. I wanted her to know — 
I have been meaning to tell her that I was at the bottoin 
of this "Teat trouble " 



 

"N"o, you were not," cries Cynthia incisively. "You 
surely did not tell her that ? " and she stops surprised. 

" She understood at once." 

" You feel that if it had been left to Eegina she would 
have given up our part of the money rather than have 
stirred in a matter likely to make a scandal! Kemember 
she would not have had the right. The money, if it is 
again awarded to us, is mothei-'s. Still, I am glad she 
had no voice in the matter. It is against her traditions 
that any member of a family two centuries old should 
forge a will or appropriate what was not his. Virtues are 
not always handed down in one groove. And I tliink if 
anything, the punishment should be greater. But she has a 
curiously conscientious tenderness for Perdita that will out- 
weigh all other considerations. She almost blames herself 
for the marriage. I think at that time she was endeavor- 
ing to detach Perdita from Jasper. I cannot see that it 
was any one's fault. We all liked him a good deal, but we 
should have taken time to examine into the fitness, the 
suitability, of such a step. Regina had no hand in forward- 
ing it, not as much as I. And I wish she hadn't this morbid 
conscientiousness about things. She ought to be set in a 
great open space where the sun could shine all around her, 
where there wasn't even a swinging bough to make a 
shadow." 

" Yes," laughing softly at the conceit. 

" I am thankful tjjere wasn't any difference of opinion," 
Cynthia appends archly. "As we shall have to depend 
somewhat upon you for an unbiassed rendering of affairs, I 
am glad a sort of friendly understanding has been estab- 
lished. It has always puzzled me that you and Regina, as 
relatives, have been keyed on rather discordant octaves. 
Why, I wonder ? " 

She turns suddenly in her quick way and faces him. 
There is no moon, but the great golden planets are shining 
in their sea of blue. The summer night air is rare and fine, 
— that wonderful transparency in which you can see a leaf 
stir. And his face has in it a sudden tremulous scarlet ; a 





speechless force of questioning, insistent passion lights his 
eyes. 

" Are we — do you think us so very discordant ? Ave 
there no grand thirds and fifths in human lianuonies ? 
Does it not come to be understood after a while ? " 

He is not talking to her. It is a confession to the stars, 
a whispering into the bland airs of the night that they 
alone may carry the sacred knowledge. Like a far flash it 
comes to Cynthia, — this thing she has half-suspected in a 
girlish fashion, doubted because it did not hold in it her 
preconceived elements of love, come to disbelieve in it at 
last, — to fancy him free from any lingering regard. Has 
there been anything more ? 

"Yes," be says with a sudden brusque alternation in 
tone, " are we so very discordant ? " 

It was as if he resented it. Cynthia feels a strong shiver 
seize her in spite of the warm summer air. This knowl- 
edge has come upon her with such an overwhelming force 
that she can only brace herself mentally. Her shattered 
resources do not at first admit of an answer. 

" Nothing is quite hopeless to a man until the end of 
life," he says softly. "And whatever I wanted, what- 
ever point of agreement was worth striving for, I should 
never give up until convinced beyond a peradventure. 
Are we talking nonsense ? " with his wholesome, tender 
laugh. Then he draws her hand just a trifle through his 
arm and they walk on in silence for some minutes. 

"We shall all befriend Perdita," he says presently. 
" She is very young, and I cannot believe this unfortuiiale 
marriage is to blight her whole life. But I would as soon 
place her in the lair of some prowler of the wilderness as 
to send her back to Jasper Bradley. I do not believe he 
will ever ask it. He has made no further effort that I can 
leam. How does he know where she is — whether in want 
or suffering or lying dead somewhere ? " 

The picture of him in his grace and beauty, in his curious 
golden lights, comes up before Cynthia. His devotion to 
his father, his kindly, touching attentions to her mother, 




the many charming theories, half-beliefs, delightful quali- 
ties ; and one other remembrance that touches her sweet 
nature with a kind of acrid temper, — Hegina has preferred 
him to Winterburne, has not hesitated to subtly place the 
latter on that lower round when he should have reigned a 
king. 

" Regina is stirred with profound tenderness for the 
poor little girl," he says in that delicate approval, alrhost 
like a stab to Cynthia. Has no one else been tender ? 

Cynthia is curiously unresponsive. To-night of all 
nights he longs to hear the tender praise, the soft, excusing 
words that fall so readily from the younger's lips. There 
is a vague sense of loss, an uncomprehended disturbance in 
the fine sympathy she has been wont to give. 

" Are you tired ? " he asks presently in that sweet inde- 
scribable tone. " Your steps lag a little. I ought not 
have brought you out. You must not let me blunder so in 
seeking my own pleasure." 

He turns her round. The rest of the talk is about the 
six weeks when he shall have none of the charming home 
life that he declares has spoiled both him and Arinitage. 
Jason Prall and his wife are sitting side by side in the 
starlight on the step of the back porch, — the wanderers 
have come through the garden. Cynthia stares a little 
blindly at these commonplace people, who have cared for 
each other nearly forty years with no wide range of senti- 
ment. 

She looks in at Perdita who is sleeping restlessly with 
one thin arm over her head. Lois sits nodding. Alice is 
in her bed, a white ghost. 

" Come and tell me if you had a nice walk," she says 
cordially, holding out one hand. 

" I believe I was too tired to enjoy it." 

Cynthia's tone is weary, the clasp of her fingers languid. 

" You poor child. I am afraid we haven't half consid- 
ered you, doing double duties everywhere. When we are 
away by ourselves " — 

"Yes." Cynthia gives a feeble little laugh and says 





good-night.- The story that Alice has counted on — she 
can see everything in this sharp second sight, — will never 
be hers to tell. 

Cynthia Hal ford sits by the open window in a wide 
wakefulness she has rarely linown before. It seems as if 
she would never sleep again. Like a picture, the summer 
passes before her, the sweet summer that can never come 
again, the vague beatitude that can have no name. It has 
passed the calm borderland of friendship, it has not reached 
the open sea of love. She is too essentially just to covet 
what belongs to another, she knows now it always belonged 
back in the little parlor, where he used to talk to them 
and watch Regina. She does not understand this involved 
nature, she only knows if so splendid a love as this man 
can give were offered for her acceptance, she would be 
impelled by that mysterious, nameless power to take it. 
She could not even hold him at arm's length while she was 
considering. "Will Kegina ever come to love him as such a 
large, generous nature should be loved ? 

But, after all, that is not what must decide it for her. 
She has seen a splendid possibility — for another woman. 
Whether for good or ill, joy or pain, all his life long he 
will set Eegina above all others. He will be steadfast 
until she puts it out of his power to think of her honorably, 
but as the dead are recalled. She is proud in all her pain 
that it is simply her mistake, that he has uttered no word, 
that he has never held her hand in gentle dalliance, or 
pressed it to his lips. He has been an honorable gentleman. 



 



CHAPTEE XXVI 

BETWEEN WIND AND WAVES 

A SOFT, rainy July day broods over the earth. It has 
that incomparable fragrance out here where the short grass 
and the branching trees drink it in. The hills are toned 
with purple-gray, wrapped in illusory mists that reach up 
to the vague outline of sky. Cynthia iinds it intensely 
comfoiting. She is glad not to have the sunshine. Pres- 
ently she means to go out in it again, for she could not sit 
in the shade any length of time, nor have things blurred, 
like these trees and distant mountains. She cannot barter 
all the warm, bright material values for indefinite, unsatis- 
fying dreams of what might have been, but never was. 
Her brave nature is honest to the core. And she has this 
gift, this one thing Kegina has coveted. Is there some 
curious purpose in all these lines, that seem so crossed and 
tangled ? Regina would ask for nothing outside of it. 
She would gloat over it as a miser over his treasure. 

And here is this other wonderful, beautiful richness ready 
for her to take, to wrap herself in, to wind about her as a 
rare, priceless garment. Cynthia stands amazed that one 
could pass it by unknowingly even. That Regina may 
have refused it does not oven occur to her ; but it will 
always be hers. And they can no more change possessions 
than they can change their natures. The conceit amuses 
her. 

She was late in sleeping, so she has not come down until 
long after Winterburne's departure. Only Lois has been 
there to pour his coffee and give him the unspoken God 
speed to his daily duties. She knows how brightly, how 
-joyfully he will go at thein. Will auy one else ever come 




to appreciate this wide, outflowing nature ? Will not the 
other strive to keep it within bounds, to clip and train and 
thwart its larger uses ? 

Perdita is brought down-stairs in Lois's strong arms, and 
walks about a little. She is restless, and impatient to get 
to Beverly. So far she has expressed only fear concerning 
Jasper, and not the slightest desire to see him. Alice is 
languid, and Cynthia makes an effort to appear like her 
olden self ; but she feels washed out like the day. They 
read a little, they plan a little, and the hours go by. Arm- 
itage comes home with Wiiiterburne. There are some last 
things to consult Cynthia about. A distraught expression 
comes and goes in his face, and lo ! Cynthia's tender interest 
is aroused. There is so much in the wide, varied world ! 

The next day Perdita is taken home to the strange, new 
house she has never seen ; but it holds her more than 
mother, and the restful love she has longed for all these 
weary months. She is safe in the clinging arms ; their 
kisses and tears mingle together. 

Regina is so cheerfully ready with her assistance that 
Cynthia wonders she has never recognized this invaluable 
quality in her before. Then she recalls that the elder has 
always done the planning, and brought about astonishing 
results in her clear, definite, if restricted fashion. It seems 
a little unkind to go away and leave her with all these 
cares and burden's. But Mr. Sayre will be her friendly 
adviser in any stress. 

And at last Eegina Halford is alone with her new duties. 
The journey has tired Perdita ; but the delight and ease 
restore her wonderfully. She has such an appreciative 
listener in Mrs. Halford, such an ardent sympathizer, who 
can be quite as inconsequent as herself. They find hosts 
of charming virtues in Jasper, then they turn to the grave 
and bitter faults. 

" And if I had been wiser and stronger," bewails Perdita. 
"But I was so frightened, and I tried to make myself 
believe it was a dream ; I did, really. I loved him so 
much then. I was only afraid of losing liim, and I thought 



 

I could never live without him. Why, it seems now as 
if I had been bewitched with some horrible spell. Do you 
think he will come for me ? mother, you will not let 
me go ? " and Perdita sobs wildly at the thought. 

Is this the love that less than a year ago gave up home 
and everything for Jasper's sake ! Regina wonders with a 
curl of the lip that is ineffable scorn. And yet, who has 
taught her anything of the personal sacredness of marriage ? 
It comes natural to Regina, as all matters of serious import 
seem to do. But this little butterfly, of whom no one 
expected grave consideration, has made a sad mess of her 
life. How shall she be taught to respect bonds that have 
been so lightly entered into ? for she is still Jasper Brad- 
ley's wife. Regina tries to imagine on what side duty 
would lie if he came and demanded her again. 

Meanwhile, there is the small world of Beverly to face. 
The reopening of the will case is not so far off but that 
people begin to discuss it. The fact has come out that Mr. 
Lane never signed the will ; and there are dozens of wit- 
nesses who can recall now, from some particular circum- 
stance, a very direct corroboration. The theory is the will 
was written for some purpose, since the paper is actually 
of a twenty-years'-ago make, and like that largely used by 
Mr. Paulin. But that Mr. Bradley ever intended it to be 
used becomes more and more unlikely to the townspeople, 
who remember that after the last visit, neither aunt nor 
uncle ever mentioned the nephew. 

As Perdita grows stronger, and begins to take more 
interest in matters, this is explained to her one day by 
Mr. Sayre. Regina has left it to her whether she will 
keep her own secret or not. 

" What, can they do with Jasper ? " she asks wild- 
eyed. 

"The punishment is imprisonment. But we cannot 
really tell who forged the signatures." 

Perdita studies the flowers on the carpet in an absent 
manner. 

"Mr. Bradley was always writing," she says; "and he 





used to write long lists of names. They used to burn 
papers in the fireplace. I have seen the ends." 

" Did anything especial occur the day,you went there ? " 
he asks suddenly. 

Perdita turns pale and red, and then begins to cry in an 
uncertain, trivial fashion. 

" It is against her own husband," Eegina says in a half 
protest. There is something terrible to her in thus care- 
lessly betraying the soul ona has promised to honor. 

"He wasn't my husband then," Perdita cries inconse- 
quently. She veers round so quickly, her most passionate 
impulses are so evanescent. Regina cannot properly esti- 
mate her. The year has changed her greatly, and she is 
like a new character, with bits and suggestions of the old. 

" If you had not learned about this other matter," she 
begins with tremulous eagerness, looking at the lawyer with 
feverishly bright eyes. '• If I had all the secret, but I 
haven't, and I did tall it to Mr. Winterburne. I was almost 
crazy. Why, if I had remained with Jasper, I might have 
gone quite out of my mind, then he could have shut me up 
as he threatened." 

" Threatened ? " Mr. Sayre says with a sharp accent. 

She glances up at Eegina. She has a childish fondness 
for retailing her woes and having them sympathetically 
appreciated. She has been so deprived of all confidences 
dear to youthful feminine nature, and now she plunges into 
the story. Mr. Sayre notes the various connecting links. 
He has had no doubt latterly, now he is indignant, that 
even this guileless child has been used to further such con- 
temptibly dishonest purposes. He quite loses sight of her 
weakness and want of courage at the opportune moment; 
perhaps her very frankness serves to disarm any censure 
of the poor, trembling, excited little thing with her large 
pleading eyes that look out of such a wan, eager face. 

When Regina' goes down-stairs with Mr. Sayre, she 
pauses in the liall, and raises her eyes beseechingly. 

" Will Perdita have to be called upon as a witness ? " 
she asks with a shrinking terror. 



 

" My dear Miss Halford, do not distress yourself," and he 
takes her slim, cold hand. " I think not. My opinion is 
that Jasper Bradley will not appear in the matter at all, 
for the simple reason that he cannot face it, that he knows 
the truth;" the lawyer gives a grim suggestion of a smile. 
" Then the case will be a very easy one. But you do not 
mean to allow Perdita ever to go back to him ? though I 
doubt if he asks it." 

" You think a separation is just ? " B.egina asks it hesi- 
tatingly. She has been curiously balancing it in her miii<l, 
because she would like to sever every thread of connec- 
tion with him. She doubts her own sense of that higher 
right. It was for good and ill alike. 

"Jasper Bradley lives merely on the surface, and re- 
spects no law, human or divine, that interferes with his 
personal comfort. He would not make a good husband for 
any woman ; he is capable of being an especially bad one 
for Perdita. No doubt he would desert her if it suited his 
purpose. I dare say he knows just where she is. If he 
should come and demand her, my advice is not to let her 
go. A man who talks of shutting his wife in an asylum, 
before he has been married a year ! " 

Eegina shudders. "No, it would never do." 

Then a few days later she surprises Perdita one morning 
in a tempest of passionate sobs, her slight frame rent 
with emotion. 

"I've been thinking it all over as I lay here, Eegina, 
and how happy we were at first, when I could forget that 
horrible secret ! He told me once I had no business to 
enter the room, and T had not. I was a mean, wretched 
little spy ! I deserved all the miserable recollections. 
But you can't think how delightful he was at times, and he 
had that warm, goldeny beauty like the sunshine. I miss 
him so much, — his caressing arms, his soft, sweet, bewil- 
dering kisses, all his tender pet names, his dainty, endear- 
ing ways. I want to be loved, and I can't live without it ! 
You are so cold, Regina ! He said you were like an ice- 
berg ; that you would freeze a man's soul out of him ; that 





you had a beautiful face, but no tenderness ; that you only 
wanted a man to do homage to you, and not even kiss your 
finger tips. But I love him, love him ! It has all come 
back to me. I cannot stand the intolerable loneliness. 
Can't we find him ? " And she looks up with wild, pathetic 
eagerness. 

" Perdita ! " The elder is horrified with this outburst. 

" I'm so young," she goes on piteously, " to live a whole 
long life without him ? and when he came to know that it 
wasn't my fault, that I didn't betray him, but the secret 
came to light in an altogether different manner, I think, he 
would forgive me, and love me again. Doesn't anybody know 
where to write ? Why, I'd go back if I could be sure of 
finding him. I want him so ! He did love me. And 
when he came here I dare say you were cold and cruel to 
him. He said you hated to have him love anybody else ; 
that you would keep me from him if you could ! You know 
you wanted to send me away to school ! And he was afraid 
you would persuade them all to refuse to let me marry 
him. You were jealous " — 

"I — jealous ! " Eegina's eyes transfix her. " Why, he 
asked me to marry him a week or two before we went to 
Mount Sardis. I had meant that he never should, and 
thought I had made him understand. I dare say all this 
time he was pretending to care for you." 

" He asked you to marry him ! " Perdita interrupts, and 
her face is ghostly white. 

Certainly she can say with all honesty that was what he 
meant. 

" He pretended to love you ? It was all a pretence. 
Why, he loved me from the very first day he came ; he told 
me so a hundred times. And there was all our playing all 
the delicious summer " — Her voice falls to that sweet, 
indescribable credulity. 

" Yes, you were much better suited to him, and, Perdita, 
no one would have made any serious objection. I liked 
him very much at first, but I had a fancy that he wasn't 
quite true. And I think he may have pretended to love 



 

me, but you and he are both deeply, wholly mistaken, if 
you think I could have cared in that way." 

Her whole body seems to sway with passionate indigna- 
tion, and her face is in a scarlet flame that turns slowly to 
white heat. 

Ferdita rises from her pillow and leans her tear-wet face 
upon her hand. 

" You can't understand what a delight it was to be with 
him — no, you couldn't have loved him," in a dreamy, far- 
off manner. " Go away and leave me ! " starting suddenly and 
beating the pillow with her small fist desperately clinched, 

Eegina turns haughtily and sweeps out of the room in 
her most imperious fashion. She cannot understand this 
inconsequent being. Was it just or kindly to repeat that 
detestable episode ? Oh, how does Cynthia steer clear of 
all these rocks and shoals ? How little wisdom she, Eegina, 
has, after all her search ! She feels suddenly weak and help- 
less — it is not a new experience of late. If she could be 
taken in some one's arms and comforted ! Like a far halo 
of light shining out of darkness a vision comes to her, a 
loyal lover, her loyal lover ! All this time there has never 
been an hour when she needed him, and now — 

An unfathomable longing sweeps through her, that trans- 
port of worship for something near by, human, that shall 
be strong and comprehending, that shall impel her through 
the mysterious channels of womanhood to some haven of 
exultant rest. She is so tired of fighting and studying all 
these things in the secret darkness of her own soul. 

Mrs. Halford is sitting placidly by the shaded window 
where the languid sweetness of the first day lilies mingles 
with a bed of pungent heliotrope. She has lain down her 
book upon the window-sill, and is watching the dancing 
shadows of the vines as the sun quivers in and out. Eegina 
crosses the room swiftly, throws herself on the hassock, and 
buries her face in her mother's lap. A deep, tearless sob 
shakes her tumultuously. 

" My dear Regina ! " The soft fingers caress her hair, 
and the very touch seems grateful. 





" It is Perdita ! " she begins brokenly. " Or, have I 
some fatal quality that interferes with the comfort I would 
fain give, and turns it into bitterness ? We have all blindly 
allowed her to stray into this trouble; but I wanted to 
strengthen her to live out of it." 

"It is too soon. She has hardly reached beyond the 
rough, broken shore ; she has not gone out to the overwhelm- 
ing sea. It may be that Heaven will keep her from the 
deeper sorrow," 

'' But — how can she love him ! " 

" Ah, she has come to that !" says the mother. "There 
will be many alternations. She did, no doubt, love him, 
but she does not know her own capabilities, her judgment 
is so immature. Our greatest hope is that he may not 
return and take her in an unguarded moment. She has 
hardly longed for him yet." 

" But a man who can so deceive, who can lie, and defraud, 
and possibly forge " — Kegina cries with horror. 

" You do not understand." Mrs. Halford studies her faiir 
daughter. " It is looking at different sides of a picture. 
Jasper had a great many charming ways and occasionally 
the love and tenderness will flood her being and sweep 
out all other memories. So far, she has taken the matter 
very lightly, with more indifference than I could really 
approve. To show so little sorrow at the downfall of her 
youthful romance would prove her indeed heartless. Have 
patience, Eegina, with her changes. It will be bitter 
enough for the poor child. I must go to her." 

It is a sad, long day for Perdita. Mrs. Halford soothes 
and comforts. It seems so hard to -have her, in some de- 
gree, repeat her mother's story ; but this will not be as 
full of suffering. Perdita has friends to stand by her 
in any emergency. And if Jasper Bradley never comes 
back — 

Late in the afternoon Perdita begs to see Eegina. She 
looks so little and childish lying there, her pallid face 
defined like a cameo on the pillow, the once pretty, rounded 
cheeks fallen in, and the outline of the chin sharpened. 



 

The brown eyes have wept themselves softly lustrous, 
though their rims are still discolored. 

" O Ke," she cries pathetically, " was I very dreadful to 
you this morning ? I had been thinking of him and all 
the delights, the journeys, and plays, and operas, and ten- 
der words and caresses until I quite forgot about the rest. 
And you have all been so kind to me ! What if I had not 
come here, but wandered away off and been sick in a hos- 
pital ? For I was almost dead with fatigue when I reached 
Warwick ; and Mr. Winterburne was gentle and tender and 
would not let me go off as I had planned. For the horror 
of being thrust into an asylum was upon me. You don't 
understand how I can love him after all tbat, and all the 
falsehoods ! I think it isn't the true Jasper that I love, 
it is the graces, and tenderness, and beauty that I seein to 
incorporate in what I believed he was. And it made me so 
angry when you said — but he used to make me angry too, 
by admiring you, and all beautiful, stately women. Only 
I can't always be glad for the love lost out of my life." 

"My dear cbild," and Eegina kneels beside her, takes 
the small, throbbing fingers in liers so firm and white, " I 
am sorry I said what I did. I had no right to betray my 
own and Jasper's secret as well. I never had any real faith 
in his regard for me, but after that I really desired to save 
you, a;t least, to keep you from any entanglement until you 
bad seen enough of the world to judge a little and compare." 

" 'No, it was quite right. It will help me to understand 
the hollowness of his protestations ; " and a sad, .serious ex- 
pression wavers over ber face. " Mother has aided me to 
look at it in the i-ight ligbt. If Jasper comes and is repent- 
ant, she thinks I niight venture to begin life again with 
him ; but now I feel as if all the anger were spent, and I can. 
see my own wilfulness and disregard o,f you all, and the 
trouble I have brought upon you. Ee dear, I wish you 
would help me to be strong and clear-minded, and take right 
views of everything." 

There are teai-s in Eegina's eyes as slie kisses the plead- 
ing lips. 





" You must get well first," she says cheerfully. " You 
and I will have some nice times, for you see I am quite 
lonely with Cynthia being away. I never told you how 
brave she was last autumn when we had only such a very 
little money." 

" She went over there and taught school for that ! " 
Perdita cries breathlessly. " Jasper took the money away 
from you all ! And he told me he should never disturb 
your share, that it was only Mr. Winterburne he meant to 
dispossess. Oh, I quite hate myself for loving him ! I am 
filled with horror and shame that I should long for him ! " 
and now Perdita swings to the farther extreme. " I wonder 
if you will all be able to forgive me ? I do not deserve it." 

Kegina has only gone such a little way in that divine 
endeavor, she is such a fearful and trembling pilgrim that 
comforting and directing is a new, strange language, and 
halts on her tongue. For even in this has she not been 
living to herself, withholding in her cold, quiet grace, 
rather than reaching out to other souls ? She has not 
Cynthia's generous aptitude, and the work is harder in its 
newness. But if she is strong, and earnest, and willing, 
she must also be compassionate, patient with all mental 
inferiority as well as the sort of moral weakness that 
depends so largely upon others, that draws its strength 
from outside sources rather than the living wells that can 
spring from the soul. She has taken this for her task, let 
her then accept it joyfully, not with secret distaste. 

" How sweet you are Regina," the soft voice says 
tremulously. "And I called you cold! If you only will 
love me a little and help me ! I am so frivolous and good 
for nothing. Yes, I have a genius, really. You haven't 
heard me play in so long. When I am better, I want a 
violin again. A professor of music told me that I had an 
extraordinary gift. At first Jasper allowed me to take 
lessons, then he grew desperately tired of it. But I used 
to pi ly through the long hours when he was away. Re — 
you will let me have a violin again ? " 

That is a crucial test for Regiua, and she weakly evades. 



 

She thinks she can never listen to a violin with com- 
posure. 

They are just through supper, and Mrs. Halford has 
gone up-stairs, while Kegina attends to a few household 
matters. Mr. Winterbnrne is announced. A most inoppor- 
tune guest, she thinks — does he ever strike that perfect 
moment, making a harmony ? 

She goes quietly through to the parlor. It is not dark 
enough for lamps, but she is thankful for the soft uncer- 
tainties that are beginning to gather about the room. The 
tall, compact figure with its sentient vitality almost 
oppresses her in her curiously relaxed state. He takes 'her 
hand and leads her to the window; there is a corner just 
below it, and the chairs ranged as if for a tete-a-tete. In one 
of those unheeding moods, ignorant that she has conceded 
anything, she takes her position nearest the window, and 
faces him in twilight softness, unconsciously indifferent. 

There is so much to tell. He has spent his Sunday at 
the seaside. Cynthia is already improved, blooming and 
full of vivid life, but Alice he finds very languid. 

" I don't know what she would do without your sister," 
he says eagerly. " She has been so much stronger than 
usual since we came to Warwick, that I was not prepared 
for her dropping down in this fashion; but there has been 
a great deal to keep her on the strain all the time, so much 
that was new and of vital interest. And I am very thank- 
ful they were able to get off as they did. There is some 
rather alarming sickness at Warwick." 

" Alarming ! " Regina repeats. 

"Well, yes. Everything is unfavorable. The extreme 
heat and the showers have made all kinds of vegetation 
rank, — for that, read a large crop of weeds in corners and 
byways, and not infrequently back yards, and the rapid 
decay; the pools that serve for ducks and geese, the cow- 
sheds in a horrible condition. I don't wonder fever and 
other things break out ! The authorities are cleaning up a 
little, but it should have been done in the spring. Last 
week one of our best workmen died after a brief illness, 





though it hegan with a drinking bout on Saturday night. 
His oldest girl is one of Cynthia's finest scholars, and she 
is down now. What these manufacturing towns want are 
good clean tenements, not all huddled in together. The 
larger cities can't help it very well, but in a country place 
where land is cheap, it is simply heathenish. I beg your 
pardon," he says suddenly, "I know you are not interested 
in these things. I am so accustomed to discussing them 
with Cynthia." 

" But — health " — she says tentatively. " And you are 
in it " — Can any evil touch that robust yitality ? 

"I don't have to sleep there;" and he gives a short, 
comforting laugh. " If I did — But I am most concerned 
for Armitage. He is in the thick of it. Old Dr. Farrand 
isn't well, and there's so much sick visiting — he has takeli 
several of the doctor'-s funerals. Last winter the old 
gentleman considered him almost a heathen and a publican," 
and Regina can see the smile that is amusement, not con- 
tempt. "I drag Armitage out home with me to sleep 
where the air is fresh and restful, and Mrs. Prall gives us 
a splendid breakfast. He was a rather ethereal young 
fellow when I first took him in hand, and I don't want to 
lose my good efforts in having him get shadowy again. 
But I have not inquired especially after Mrs. Bradley ? " 

" She is — I think she does not improve rapidly. She 
comes down-stairs, and I have taken her out for a brief 
drive. Have you heard anything concerning Mr. 
Bradley ? " 

" I wanted to ask you. He has not been here then ? " 

" No," answers Eegina. 

"He is hardly likely to come." Winterburne's' tone 
verges on assured assertiveness. 

" I should be glad " — Regina hesitates. She has not 
been used to telling him her hopes and fears like Cynthia. 

" I think you need not fear. The question is, how she 
will take it ? It seems a very cruel happening tor a glad, 
joyous young life like that, to be unexpectedly torn up by 
the roots, even if it is thrown over the garden fence from 



 

which it was transplanted. One would hardly expect just 
these things I'vom Jasper Bradley. I want to tell you how 
I iirst saw him." 

He makes a picture of it all. She has never given him 
credit for vivid descriptive powers. Has she not dealt him 
scant measure in many respects beside ? Or is  that 
lie has not stood still — that he, like some others, has a 
grand capacity for self-improvement as well as that general 
outside advancement. Did she think this capability was 
inherent in special natures tonly ? And what if his is the 
special, the unusual soul ? 

She has a ctil'ious, lost feeling, another as strange, as if 
she were aware of a strongly marked presence crowding 
into her life thait she protests against with passionate 
sincerity. 

" Jasper Bl-adtey has many of the qualities and attrac- 
tions of a very dangerous man," he isays presently, when 
she is sileii't a long while, it seems to him. She never 
talked much, he remembers. " But there is a latent quality 
quite indescribable tha;t puts -one on guard." 

Regina Hal'ford flushes with a guilty feeling, thankful 
that it is now too dark for him to see. If she had taken 
her first subtle warniTig — if ste had -not been so urgently 
fitting her theories to the facts they could not really 
assimilate. 

Itis getting quite dark now. He can see the whiteness 
of her face with its crown of dusky hair, and he has an 
inward feeling that it is strangely weary. It is too soon 
to comfoft her; this time he will be wary. But oh, the 
passionate longing that l-ends him !

She rises and aslts Martha to bring in the lamps. While 
the good woman is arranging them to the proper degree of 
softness for a summer night, Eegina goes to summon her 
mother. Perdita has fallen asleep after her battling day. 

Mrs. Halford takes the lead in the conversation now. 
Regina is one of the few women born to repose ; she never 
indulges in restless little habits. Her statuesque symmetry 
has fine poses in any position she takes : every line seems 




to adapt itself to the harmonious whole. Her hands lie 
idly in her lap, and her slim fingers look as if they might 
be sculptured. Could they grasp and hold, he wonders ? 

He has so much to say about Cynthia. The mother 
quality in Mrs. Halford takes a finer pride in her daughter's 
venture and possible fame than he has supposed. 

" She cannot miss success If she perseveres," he says. 
" She has such a quick eye for the homely little details of 
every-day life, she goes so down to the very heart of things, 
she catches the salient peculiarities of these out-of-the-way 
lives, their simple, unimaginative steadfastness, their nar- 
row range, their shrewd, unconscious humor. She has so 
much of it herself. Everything is tinted and textured by 
her bright hopefulness ; Armitage is very proud of her." 

He is proud too, Regina can see. A sudden, quick 
thought comes to her. He will marry her. She is just the 
sympathetic, appreciative kind of woman that he needs, 
who will make him happy, — immeasurably so. It leaves 
a great blank and coldness in her soul, not because she 
loves him, but that the best gifts of life are likely to pass 
her by. All of her ideals have been too high : she recog- 
nizes this sadly. 

Yet she looks brightly across at him. Now she wants to 
do him full justice, to make amends for the scant measure 
she has dealt out to him. As a friend she can do this. 
Her sincerity is evident ; it softens the firm lines in her 
face, and he, watching her in a diffident, neutral fashion, 
is rather doubtful, yet wholly delighted. 

He does not plume himself on any conquest. It is enough 
just now to be on the simplest terms of friendship. He 
means to stretch it a long way, to make it. cover a great 
many points. • ., _ 

" You will not mind my coming again ? " he asks per- 
suasively ; " I promised Cynthia. And I miss them so 
much, all the friendly home interest and delight. I have 
bepu quite spoiled of late." 

" Yes," she answers softly, glancing up utterly uncon- 
scious of the deeper meaning on his part. 



 

In a vagne, mysterious mood she goes to her room, won- 
dering why this matter does not touch her more keenly 
regards herself. She is not jealous, she is not stirred, not 
excited, neither does she feel to blaine him for transferring 
his allegiance to another ; she has simply put him out of 
her life, and he has at last comprehended the fact. There 
is a sacred kind of gladness that through all the long time
