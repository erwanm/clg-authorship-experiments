gave me no drink : I was a stranger, and ye took me not in : 
naked, and ye clothed me not : I was sick, and in prison, and 
ye visited me not. Then shall they answer unto him, Lord, 
when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or 
naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee ? 
Then shall he say unto them, Inasmuch as ye did it not to 
one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it not to me." 

St. Clare seemed struck with this last passage, for he 
read it twice the second time slowly, and as if he were 
revolving the words in his mind. 

"Tom," he said, "these folks that get such hard measure- 
seem to have been doing just what I have living good, easy, 
respectable lives ; and not troubling themselves to inquire 
how many of their brethren were hungry or athirst, or sick, 
or in prison." 

Tom did not answer. 

St. Clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the 
verandah, seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts ; 




so absorbed was he, that Tom had to remind him twice that 
the tea-bell had rung, before he could get his attention. 

St. Clare was absent and thoughtful all tea-time. After 
tea, he and Marie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the 
parlour, almost in silence. 

Marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain, and was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia 
silently busied herself with her knitting. St. Clare sat 
down to the piano, and began playing a soft and melancholy 
movement with the JEolian accompaniment. He seemed in 
a deep reverie, and to be soliloquising to himself by music. 
After a little, he opened one of the drawers, took out an old 
music-book, whose leaves were yellow with age, and began 
turning it over. 

"There," he said to Miss Ophelia, "this was one of my 
mother's books, and here is her handwriting come and 
look at it. She copied and arranged this from Mozart's 
Kequiem." Miss Ophelia came accordingly. 

" It was something she used to sing often," said St. Clare. 
" I think I can hear her now." 

He struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that 
grand old Latin piece, the "Dies Irs3." 

Tom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn 
by the sound to the very door, where he stood earnestly. 
He did not understand the words, of course ; but the music 
and manner of singing appeared to affect him strongly, 
especially when St. Clare sang the more pathetic parts. 
Tom would have sympathised more heartily, if he had known 
the meaning of the beautiful words : 

" Eecordare, Jesu pie, 
Quod sum causa tuse vise, 
Ne me perdas ilia die : 
Quserens me, sedisti lassus, 
Redemisti crucem passus, 
Tantus labor non sit cassus." 



" These lines have been thus rather inadequately translated : 
" Think, Jesus, for what reason 
Thou endured'st earth's spite and treason, 
Nor me lose, in that dread season. 
Seeking me, thy worn feet hasted, 
On the cross thy soul death tasted : 
Let not all these toils be wasted." 





St. Clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the 
words ; for the shadowy veil of years seemed drawn away, 
and he seemed to hear his mother's voice leading his. 
Voice and instrument seemed both living, and threw out 
with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal Mozart 
first conceived as his own dying requiem. 

When St. Clare had done singing, he sat leaning his head 
upon his hand a few moments, and then began walking up 
and down the floor. 

" What a sublime conception is that of a last judgment !" 
said he. " A righting of all the wrongs of ages ! a solving 
of all moral problems, by an unanswerable wisdom ! It is, 
indeed, a wonderful image." 

" It is a fearful one to us," said Miss Ophelia;" 

" It ought to be to me, I suppose," said St. Clare, stopping 
thoughtfully. "I was reading to Tom this afternoon that 
chapter in Matthew that gives an account of it, and I have 
been quite struck with it. One should have expected some 
terrible enormities charged to those who are excluded from 
Heaven, as the reason ; but no they are condemned for not 
doing positive good, as if that included every possible harm." 

u Jf e'rhaps,' said Miss uphelia, "it is impossible ibr a 
person who does no good not to do harm." 

"And what," said St. Clare, speaking abstractedly, but 
with deep feeling, " what shall be said of one whose own 
heart, whose education, and the wants of society, have called 
in vain to some noble purpose ; who has floated on a dreamy
neutral, spectator of the struggles, agonies, and wrongs of 
man, when he should have been a worker ?" 

" I should say," said Miss Ophelia, " that he ought to 
repent, and begin now." 

" Always practical and to the point ! " said St. Clare, his 
face breaking out into a smile. "You never leave me any 
time for general reflections, cousin ; you always bring me 
short up against the actual present; you have a kind of 
eternal now, always in your mind." 

" Now is all the time I have anything to do with," said 
Miss Ophelia. 

"Dear little Eva poor child ! " said St. Clare, " she had 
set her simple little soul on a good work for me." 

It was the first time since Eva's death that he had ever 





said as many words as these of her, and he spoke now 
evidently repressing very strong feeling. 

"My view of Christianity is such," he added, "that I 
think no man can consistently profess it without throwing 
the whole weight of his being against this monstrous system 

(of injustice that lies at the foundation of all our society ; 
and, if need be, sacrificing himself in the battle. That is, 
I mean that I could not be a Christian otherwise, though 
I have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlight- 
ened and Christian people who did no such thing ; and I 
confess that the apathy of religious people on this subject, 
their want of perception of wrongs that filled me with 
horror, have engendered in me more scepticism than any 
other thing." 

"If you knew all this," said Miss Ophelia, "why didn't 
you do it?" 

" Oh, because I have had only that kind of benevolence 
which consists in lying on a sofa, and cursing the church 
and clergy for not being martyrs and confessors. One can 
see, you know, very easily, how others ought to be martyrs." 

" Well, are you going to do differently now ? " said Miss 
Ophelia. 

" God only knows the future," said St. Clare. " I am 
braver than I was, because I have lost all ; and he who has 
nothing to lose can afford all risks." 

" And what are you going to do ? " 

" My duty, I hope, to the poor and lowly, as fast as I find 
it out," said St. Clare, " beginning with my own servants, for 
whom I have yet done nothing ; and perhaps, at some future 
day, it may appear that I can do something for a whole 
class, something to save my country from the disgrace of 
that false position in which she now stands before all 
civilised nations." 

" Do you suppose it possible that a nation ever, will 
voluntarily emancipate?" said Miss Ophelia. 

" I don't know," said St. Clare. " This is a day of great 
deeds. Heroism and disinterestedness are rising up, here 
and there, in the earth. The Hungarian nobles set free 
millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary loss ; and, 
perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do 
not estimate honour and justice by dollars and cents." 





" I hardly think so," said Miss Ophelia. 

" But suppose we should rise up to-morrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them 
how to use their freedom ? They never would rise to do 
much among us. The fact is, we are too lazy and unpractical ourselves ever to give them much of an idea of that 
industry and energy which is necessary to form them into 
men. They will have to go north, where labour is the 
fashion the universal custom ; and tell me, now, is there 
enough Christian philanthropy among your northern states 
to bear with the process of their education and elevation ? 
You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions; but 
could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns 
and villages, and give your time and thoughts, and money, 
to raise them to the Christian standard ? That's what I 
want to know. If we emancipate, are you willing to educate ? How many families in your town would take in a 
negro man and woman, teach them, bear with them, and 
seek to make them Christians ? How many merchants 
would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him a clerk ; or 
mechanics, if I wanted him taught a trade ? If I wanted to 
put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools are there 
in the northern states that would take them in ? how many 
families that would board them ? and yet they are as white 
as many a woman, north or south. . You see, cousin, I want 
justice done us. We are in a bad position. We are the more 
obvious oppressors of the negro ; but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe." 

"Well, cousin, I know it is so," said Miss Ophelia. " I 
know it was so with me, till I saw that it was my duty to 
overcome it ; but I trust I have overcome it, and I know 
there are many good people at the north who in this matter 
need only to be taught what their duty is to do it. It would 
certainly be a greater self-denial to receive heathen among 
us than to send missionaries to them ; but I think we would 
do it." 

" You would, I know," said St. Clare. " I'd like* to see 
anything you wouldn't do, if you thought it your duty ! " 

" Well, I'm not uncommonly good," said Miss Ophelia. 
" Others would, if they saw things as I do. I intend to take 
Topsy home, when I go. I suppose our folks will wonder, 







at first ; but I think they will be brought to see as I do. 
Besides, I know there are many people at the north who do 
exactly what you said." 

" Yes, but they are a minority ; and if we should begin to 
emancipate to any extent, we should soon hear from you." 

Miss Ophelia did not reply. There was a pause of some 
moments; and St. Clare's countenance was overcast by a 
sad, dreamy expression. 

" I don't know what makes me think of my mother so 
much to-night," he said. " I have a strange kind of feeling, 
as if she were near me. I keep thinking of things she used 
to say. Strange what brings these past things so vividly 
back to us, sometimes ! " 

St. Clare walked up and down the room for some minutes 
more, and then said 

" I believe I'll go down street, a few moments, and hear 
the news to-night." 

He took his hat, and passed out. 

Tom followed him to the passage, out of the court, and 
asked if he should attend him. 

" No, my boy," said St. Clare. " I shall be back in an 
hour." 

Tom sat down in the verandah. It was a beautiful 
moonlight evening, and he sat watching the rising and 
falling spray of the fountain, and listening to its murmur. 
Tom thought of his home, and that he should soon be a free 
man, and able to return to it at will. He thought how he 
should work to buy his wife and boys. He felt the muscles 
of his brawny arms with a sort of joy, as he thought they 
would soon belong to himself, and how much they could do 
to work out the freedom of his family. Then he thought of 
his noble young master, and, ever second to that, came the 
habitual prayer that he had always offered for him; and 
then his thoughts passed on to the beautiful Eva, whom he 
now thought of among the angels ; and he thought till he 
almost fancied that that bright face and golden hair were 
looking upon him, out of the spray of the fountain. And, 
so musing, he fell asleep, and dreamed he saw her coming 
bounding towards him, just as she used to come, with a 
wreath of jessamine in her hair, her cheeks bright, and her 
eyes radiant with delight ; but, as he looked, she seemed to 





rise from the ground; her cheeks wore a paler hue her 
eyes had a deep, divine radiance, a golden halo seemed 
around her head and she vanished from his sight ; and Tom 
was awakened by a loud knocking, and the sound of many 
voices at the gate. 

He hastened to undo it ; and, with smothered voices, and 
heavy tread, came several men, bringing a body, wrapped in 
a cloak, and lying on a shutter. The light of the lamp fell 
full on the face ; and Tom gave a wild cry of amazement 
and despair, that rang through all the galleries, as the men 
advanced with their burden to the open parlour door, where 
Miss Ophelia still sat knitting. 

St. Clare had turned into a cafe, to look over an evening 
paper. As he was reading, an affray arose between two 
gentlemen in the room, who were both partially intoxicated. 
St. Clare and one or two others made an effort to separate 
them, and St. Clare received a fatal stab in the side with 
a bowie-knife, which he was attempting to wrest from one 
of them. 

The house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and 
screams; servants frantically tearing their hair, throwing 
themselves on the ground, or running distractedly about 
lamenting. Tom and Miss Ophelia alone seemed to have 
any presence of mind; for Marie was in strong hysteric 
convulsions. At Miss Ophelia's direction, one of the 
lounges in the parlour was hastily prepared, and the 
bleeding form laid upon it. St. Clare had fainted, through 
pain and loss of blood; but as Miss Ophelia applied 
restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked fixedly on 
them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling 
wistfully over every object, and finally they rested on his 
mother's picture. 

The physician now arrived, and made his examination. 
It was evident, from the expression of his face, that there 
was no hope ; but he applied himself to dressing the wound, 
and he and Miss Ophelia and Tom proceeded composedly 
with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of 
the affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors 
and windows of the verandah. 

"Now," said the physician, "we must turn all these 
creatures out ; all depends on his being kept quiet." 





St. Clare opened his eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings whom Miss Ophelia and the doctor were 
trying to urge from the apartment. " Poor creatures ! " he 
said, and an expression of bitter self-reproach passed over 
his face. Adolph absolutely refused to go. Terror had 
deprived him of all presence of mind ; he threw himself 
along on the floor, and nothing could persuade him to 
rise. The rest yielded to Miss Ophelia's urgent representations, that their master's safety depended on their 
stilness and obedience. 

St. Clare could say but little ; he lay with his eyes shut, 
but it was evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts. 
After a while, he laid his hand on Tom's, who was kneeling 
beside him, and said, "Tom! poor fellow! " 

" "What, mas'r ? " said Tom, earnestly. 

" I am dying ! " said St. Clare, pressing his hand ; 
" pray ! " 

" If you would like a clergyman " said the physician. 

St. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, 
more earnestly, " Pray ! " 

And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for 
the soul that was passing the soul that seemed looking 
so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy 
blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with strong crying 
and tears. 

When Tom ceased to speak, St. Clare reached out and 
took his hand, looking earnestly at him, but saying nothing. 
He closed his eyes, but still retained his hold ; for, in the 
gates of eternity, the black hand and the white hold each 
other with an equal clasp. He murmured softly to himself, 
at broken intervals, 

" Recordare, Jesu pie 
* * * * 

Ne me perdas ilia die 
Quaerens me sedisti lassus." 

It was evident that the words he had been singing that 
evening were passing through his mind words of entreaty 
addressed to Infinite Pity. His lips moved at intervals, as 
parts of the hymn fell brokenly from them. 

"His mind is wandering," said the doctor. 





"No! it is coming HOME at last!" said St. Clare, energetically ; " at last ! at last ! " 

The effort of speaking exhausted him. The sinking pale- 
ness of death fell on him ; but with it there fell, as if shed 
from the wings of some pitying spirit, a beautiful expression 
of peace, like that of a wearied child who sleeps. 

So he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty 
hand was on him. Just before the spirit parted, he opened 
his eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and 
said, " Mother I " and then he was gone ! 



CHAPTEE XXIX. 

THE UNPROTECTED. 

hear often of the distress of the negro servants on 
the loss of a kind master, and with good reason; for no 
creature on God's earth is left more utterly unprotected and 
desolate than the slave in these circumstances. 

The child who has lost a father has still the protection 
of friends and of the law; he is something, and can do 
something has acknowleged rights and position ; the slave 
has none. The law regards him, in every respect, as devoid 
of rights, as a bale of merchandise. The only possible 
acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a 
human and immortal creature which are given to him, comes 
to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his 
master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing 
remains. 

The number of those men who know how to use wholly- 
irresponsible power humanely and generously is small. 
Everybody knows this and the slave knows it best of all ; 
so that he feels that there are ten chances of his finding an 
abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding a con- 
siderate and kind one. Therefore is it that the wail over a 
kind master is loud and long, as well it may be. 

When St. Clare breathed his last, terror and consternation 
took hold of all his household. He had been stricken down 





so in a moment, in the flower and strength of his youth ! 
Every room and gallery of the house resounded with sobs 
and shrieks of despair. 

Marie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a 
constant course of self-indulgence, had nothing to support 
the terror of the shock, and, at the time her husband breathed 
his last, was passing from one fainting-fit to another ; and he 
to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie of 
marriage passed from her for ever, without the possibility of 
even a parting word. 

Miss Ophelia, with characteristic strength and self-control, 
had remained with her kinsman to the last all eye, all ear, 
all attention, doing everything of the little that could be 
done, and joining with her whole soul in the tender and 
impassioned prayers which the poor slave had poured forth 
for the soul of his dying master. 

When they were arranging him for his last rest, they 
found upon his bosom a small, plain, miniature case, opening 
with a spring. It was the miniature of a noble and beautiful 
female face ; and on the reverse, under a crystal, a lock of 
dark hair. They laid them back on the lifeless breast dust 
to dust poor mournful relics of early dreams, which once 
made that cold heart beat so warmly ! 

Tom's whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity ; and 
while he ministered around the lifeless clay, he did not once 
think that the sudden stroke had left him in hopeless 
slavery. He felt at peace about his master ; for in that 
hour when he had poured forth his prayer into the bosom of 
his Father, he had found an answer of quietness and 
assurance springing up within himself. In the depths of 
his own affectionate nature he felt able to perceive something 
of the fulness of Divine love ; for an old oracle hath thus 
written ; " He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in Grod, and 
God in him." Tom hoped and trusted, and was at peace. 

But the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, 
and prayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, 
muddy waves of every-day life ; and up came the everlasting 
hard inquiry of " What is to be done next ?" 

It rose to the mind of Marie, as, dressed in loose mourning 
robes, and surrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in 
a great easy-chair, and inspected samples of crape and 





bombazine. It rose to Miss Ophelia, who began to turn her 
thoughts towards her northern home. It rose, in silent 
terrors to the minds of the servants, who well knew the 
unfeeling, tyrannical character of the mistress in whose 
hands they were left. All knew very well that the indulgences which had been accorded to them were not from 
their mistress, but from their master ; and that, now he was 
gone, there would be no screen between them and every 
tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction 
might devise. 

It was about a fortnight after the funeral, that Miss 
Ophelia, busied one day in her apartment, heard a gentle tap 
at the door. She opened it, and there stood Rosa, the pretty 
young quadroon whom we have before often noticed, her hair 
in disorder, and her eyes swelled with crying. 

" Miss Feely," she said, falling on her knees, and catch- 
ing the skirt of her dress, " do, do go to Miss Marie for me ! 
do plead for me ! She's goin' to send me out to be whipped 
look there ! " And she handed to Miss Ophelia a paper. 

It was an order, written in Marie's delicate Italian hand, 
to the master of a whipping establishment, to give the bearer 
fifteeen lashes. 

" What have you been doing ? " said Miss Ophelia. 

" You know, Miss Feely, I've got such a bad temper ; it's 
very bad of me. I was trying on Miss Marie's dress, and she 
slapped my face ; and I spoke out before I thought, and was 
saucy; and she said that she'd bring me down, and have me 
know, once for all, that I wasn't going to be so topping as 
I had been ; and she wrote this, and says I shall carry it. 
I'd rather she'd kill me, right out." 

Miss Ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her 
hand. 

"You see, Miss Feely," said Eosa, " I don't mind the 
whipping so much, if Miss Marie or you was to do it ; but, 
to be sent to a man and such a horrid man ! the shame of 
it, Miss Feely ! " 

Miss Ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom 
to send women and young girls to whipping-houses, to 
the hands of the lowest of men men vile enough to make 
this their profession there to be subjected to brutal expo- 
sure and shameful correction. She had known, it before ; but 





hitherto she had never realised it, till she saw the slender 
form of Rosa almost convulsed with distress. All the honest 
blood of womanhood, the strong New England blood of 
liberty, flushed to her cheeks, and throbbed bitterly in her 
indignant heart ; but, with habitual prudence and self-control, she mastered herself, and crushing the paper firmly in 
her hand, she merely said to Rosa 

" Sit down, child, while I go to your mistress." 

" Shameful ! monstrous ! outrageous !" she said to herself, 
as she was crossing the parlour. 

She found Marie sitting up in her easy-chair, with Mammy 
standing by her combing her hair ; Jane sat on the ground 
before her, busy in chafing her feet. 

"How do you find yourself to-day ? " said Miss Ophelia. 

A deep sigh and a closing of the eyes was the only reply 
for a moment ; and then Marie answered, " Oh, I don't 
know, cousin; I suppose I'm as well as I ever shall be ! " 
And Marie wiped her eyes with a cambric handkerchief, 
bordered with an inch deep of black. 

" I came," said Miss Ophelia, with a short dry cough, 
such as commonly introduces a difficult subject, " I came to 
speak with you about poor Rosa." 

Marie's eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose 
to her sallow cheeks, as she answered sharply, 

" Well ! what about her ? " 

" She is very sorry for her fault." 

" She is, is she ? She'll be sorrier before I've done with 
her ! I've endured that child's impudence long enough ; 
and now I'll bring her down I'll make her lie in the 
dust." 

" But could not you punish her some other way, some way 
that would he less shameful ? " 

" I mean to shame her ; that's just what I want. She 
has all her life presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, 
and her lady-like airs, till she forgets who she is ; and I'll 
give her one lesson that will bring her down, I fancy ! " 

" But, cousin, consider that, 5 you destroy delicacy and 
a sense of shame in a young girl, you deprave her very 
fast." 

" Delicacy ! " said Marie, with a scornful laugh ; " a fine 
word for such as she ! I'll teach her, with all her airs, that 





she's no better than the raggedest black wench that walks 
the streets ! She'll take no more airs with me ! " 

" You will answer to Grod for such cruelty," said Miss 
Ophelia with energy. 

" Cruelty ! I'd like to know what the cruelty is ? I wrote 
orders for only fifteen lashes, and told him to put them on 
lightly. I'm sure there's no cruelty there ! " 

"No cruelty!" said Miss Ophelia. "I'm sure any girl 
might rather be killed outright ! " 

" It might seem so to anybody with your feelings, but all 
these creatures get used to it ; it's the only way they can be 
kept in order. Once let them feel that they are to take any 
airs about delicacy, and all that, and they'll run all over you, 
just as my servants always have. I've begun now to bring 
them under ; and I'll have them all to know that I'll send 
one out to be whipped as soon as another, if they don't mind 
themselves !" said Marie, looking around her decidedly. 

Jane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if 
it was particularly directed to her. Miss Ophelia sat for a 
moment, as if she had swallowed some explosive mixture, and 
were ready to burst. Then, recollecting the utter uselessness 
of contention with such a nature, she shut her lips resolutely, 
gathered herself up, and walked out of the room. 

It was hard to go back and tell Rosa that she could do 
nothing for her ; and, shortly after, one of the man-servants 
came to say that her mistress had ordered him to take Eosa 
with him to the whipping-house, whither she was hurried, in 
spite of her tears and entreaties. 

A few days after, Tom was standing musing by the 
balconies, when he was joined by Adolph, who, since the 
death of his master, had been entirely crest-fallen and disconsolate. Adolph knew that he had always been an object 
of dislike to Marie, but while his master lived he had paid 
but little attention to it. Now that he was gone, he had 
moved about in daily dread and trembling, not knowing 
what might befal him next. Marie had held several consultations with her lawyer. After communicating with St. Clare's 
brother, it was determined to sell the place and all the 
servants, except her own personal property, and these she 
intended to take with her, and go back to her father's 
plantation. 





" Do ye know, Tom, that we've all got to be sold ? " said 
Adolph. 

"How did you hear that ? " said Tom. 

" I hid myself behind the curtains when missis was 
talking with the lawyer. In a few days we shall all be sent 
off to auction, Tom." 

" The Lord's will be done ! " said Tom, folding his arms 
and sighing heavily. 

" We'll never get another such a master," said Adolph, 
apprehensively ; " but I'd rather be sold than take my chance 
under missis." 

Tom turned away ; his heart was full. The hope of liberty, 
the thought of distant wife and children, rose up before his 
patient soul, as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port 
rises the vision of the church-spire and loving roofs of his 
native village, seen over the top of some black wave only for 
one last farewell. He drew his arms tightly over his bosom, 
and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. The 
poor old soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice 
in favour of liberty, that it was a hard wrench for him ; 
and the more he said " Thy will be done," the worse 
he felt. 

He sought Miss Ophelia who, ever since Eva's death, had 
treated him with marked and respectful kindness. 

" Miss Eeely," he said, " Mas'r St. Clare promised me my 
freedom. He told me that he had begun to take it out for 
me ; and now, perhaps, if Miss Feely would be good enough 
to speak about it to missis, she would feel like goin' on with 
it, as it was Mas'r St. Clare's wish." 

" I'll speak for you, Tom, and do my best," said Miss 
Ophelia ; " but if it depends on Mrs. St. Clare, I can't hope 
much for you : nevertheless, I will try." 

This incident occurred a few days after that of Rosa, 
while Miss Ophelia was busied in preparations to return 
north. 

Seriously reflecting within herself, she considered that 
perhaps she had shown too hasty a warmth of language in 
her former interview with Marie ; and she resolved that she 
would now endeavour to moderate her zeal, and to be as 
conciliatory as possible. So the good soul gathered herself 
up, and, taking her knitting, resolved to go into Marie's 





room, be as agreeable as possible, and negotiate Tom's case 
with all the diplomatic skill of which she was mistress. 

She found Marie reclining at length upon a lounge, 
supporting herself on one elbow by pillows, while Jane, who 
had been out shopping, was displajiing before her certain 
samples of thin black stuffs. 

" That will do," said Marie, selecting one ; " only I'm not 
sure about its being properly mourning." 

" Laws, missis," said Jane volubly, " Mrs. General 
Derbennon wore just this very thing after the General died, 
last summer ; it makes up lovely ! " 

" What do you think ? " said Marie to Miss Ophelia. 

" It's a matter of custom, I suppose," said Miss Ophelia. 
" You can judge about it better than I." 

" The fact is," said Marie, " that I haven't a dress in the 
world that I can wear ; and, as I am going to break up the 
establishment and go off next week, I must decide upon 
something." 

" Are you going so soon ? " 

"Yes. St. Clare's brother has written, and he and the 
lawyer think that the servants and furniture had better be 
put up at auction, and the place left with our lawyer." 

" There's one thing I wanted to speak with you about," 
said Miss Ophelia. " Augustine promised Tom his liberty, 
and began the legal forms necessary to it. I hope you will 
use your influence to have it perfected." 

" Indeed, I shall do no such thing ! " said Marie, sharply. 
" Tom is one of the most valuable servants on the place ; it 
couldn't be afforded any way. Besides, what does he want 
of liberty ? He's a great deal better off as he is." 

"But he does desire it very earnestly, and his master 
promised it," said Miss Ophelia. 

" I dare say he does want it," said Marie ; " they all want 
it, just because they are a discontented set, always wanting 
what they haven't got. Now I'm principled against emancipating in any case. Keep a negro under the care of a master, 
and he does well enough and is respectable ; but set them 
free, and they get lazy and won't work, and take to drinking, 
and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows. I've seen it 
tried hundreds of times. It's no favour to set them free." 

" But Tom is so steady, industrious, and pious." 





" Oh, you needn't tell me ! I've seen a hundred like 
him. He'll do very well as long as he's takea care of, 
that's all." 

"But then, consider," said Miss Ophelia, "when you set 
him up for sale, the chances of his getting a bad master." 

" Oh, that's all humbug ! " said Marie. " It isn't one 
time in a hundred that a good fellow gets a bad master ; 
most masters are good, for all the talk that is made. I've 
lived and grown up here in the South, and I never yet was 
acquainted with a master that didn't treat his servants well, 
quite as well as is worth while. I don't feel any fears on 
that head." 

"Well," said Miss Ophelia, energetically. "I know it 
was one of the last wishes of your husband, that Tom should 
have his liberty ; it was one of the promises that he made to 
dear little Eva gp. her death-bed, and I should not think you 
would feel at liberty to disregard it." 

Marie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this 
appeal, and began sobbing and using her smelling-bottle with 
great vehemence. 

" Everybody goes against me," she said. "Everybody is 
so inconsiderate ! I shouldn't have expected that you would 
bring up all these remembrances of my troubles to me ; it's 
so inconsiderate ! But nobody ever does consider my trials 
are so peculiar ! It is so hard that, when I had only one 
daughter, she should have been taken ! and when I had a 
husband that just exactly suited me and I'm so hard to be 
suited ! he should be taken ! And you seem to have so 
little feeling for me, and keep bringing it up to me so carelessly when you know how it overcomes me ! I suppose 
you mean well ; but it is very inconsiderate, very ! " And 
Marie sobbed, and gasped for breath, and called Mammy to 
open the window, and to bring her the camphor-bottle, and 
to bathe her head and unhook her dress ; and, in the general 
confusion that ensued, Miss Ophelia made her escape to her 
apartment. 

She saw at once that it would do no good to say anything 
more, for Marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits ; 
and after this, whenever her husband's or Eva's wishes with 
regard to the servants were alluded to, she always found it 
convenient to set one in operation Miss Ophelia therefore 





did the next best thing she could for Tom; she wrote a 
letter to Mrs. Shelby for him, stating his troubles, and 
urging them to send to his relief. 

The next day, Tom and Adolph, and some half-dozen 
other servants, were marched down to a slave-warehouse to 
await the convenience of the trader, who was going to make 
up a lot for auction. 



CHAPTEE XXX. 

THE SLAVE WAREHOUSE. 

A SLAVE warehouse ! Perhaps some of my readers 
conjure up horrible visions of such a place. They fancy 
some foul, obscure den, some horrible Tartarus " informis, 
ingens, cui lumen ademptum" But no, innocent friend! in 
these days men have learned the art of sinning expertly and 
genteelly, so as not to shock the eyes and senses of respectable society. Human property is high in the market ; and 
is therefore well fed, well cleaned, tended and looked after, 
that it may come to sale sleek, and strong, and shining. A 
slave warehouse in New Orleans is a house externally not 
much unlike many others, kept with neatness ; and where 
every day you may see arranged, under a sort of shed along 
the outside, rows of men and women, who stand there as a 
sign of the property sold within. 

Then you shall be courteously entreated to call and 
examine, and shall find an abundance of husbands and 
wives, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, and young children, 
to be " sold separately or in lots, to suit the convenience of 
the purchaser ; " and that soul immortal, once bought with 
blood and anguish by the Son of God, when the earth shook, 
and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, can be 
sold, leased, mortgaged, exchanged for groceries or dry 
goods, to suit the phases of trade or the fancy of the 
purchaser. 

It was a day or two after the conversation between Marie 
and Miss Ophelia, that Tom, Adolph, and about half-a-dozen 





others of the St. Clare estate, were turned over to the loving- 
kindness of Mr. Skeggs, the keeper of a depot on street, 

to await the auction, next day. 

Tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as 
had most others of them. They were ushered for the night 
into a long room, where many other men of all ages, sizes, 
and shades of complexion, were assembled, and from which 
roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding. 

"Ah, ah! that's right. Go it, boys! go it!" said Mr. 
Skeggs, the keeper. " My people are always so merry ; 
Sambo, I see ! " he said, speaking approvingly to a burly 
negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery, which 
occasioned the snouts which Tom had heard. 

As might be imagined, Tom was in no humour to join 
these proceedings ; and, therefore, setting his trunk as far as 
possible from the noisy group, he sat down on it and leaned 
his face against the wall. 

The dealers in the human article make scrupulous and 
systematic efforts to promote noisy mirth among them, as a 
means of drowning reflection and rendering them insensible 
to their condition. The whole object of the training to which 
the negro is put, from the time he is sold in the northern 
market till he arrives south, is systematically directed toward 
making him callous, unthinking, and brutal. The slave-dealer 
collects his gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them 
to some convenient, healthy place often a watering-place 
to be fattened. Here they are fed full daily ; and, because 
some are inclined to pine, a fiddle is kept commonly going 
among them, and they are made to dance daily ; and he who 
refuses to be merry in whose soul thoughts of wife, or 
child, or home, are too strong for him to be gay is marked 
as sullen and dangerous, and subjected to all the evils which 
the ill-will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man 
can inflict upon him. Briskness, alertness, and cheerfulness 
of appearance, especially before observers, are constantly 
enforced upon them, both by the hope of thereby getting a 
good master, and the fear of all that the driver may bring 
upon them if they prove unsaleable. 

"What dat ar nigger doin here?" said Sambo, coming 
up to Tom, after Mr. Skeggs had left the room. Sambo was a 





full black, of great size, very lively, voluble, and full of trick 
and grimace. 

" What you doin' here ? " said Sambo, coming up to Tom, 
and poking him facetiously in the side. " Meditatin', eh ? " 

" I am to be sold at the auction to-morrow ! " said Tom, 
quietly. 

"Sold at auction haw! haw! boys, an't this yer fun? 
I wish't I was gwine that ar way ! tell ye, wouldn't I 
make 'em laugh ? But how is it dis yer whole lot gwine 
to-morrow ? " said Sambo, laying his hand freely on Adolph's 
shoulder. 

" Please to let me alone! " said Adolph fiercely, straightening himself up with extreme disgust. 

" Law, now, boys ! dis yer's one o' yer white niggers 
kind o' cream colour, ye know, scented ! " said he, coming up 
to Adolph and snuffing. " O Lor ! he'd do for a tobaccer- 
shop ; they could keep him to scent snuff ! Lor, he'd keep 
a whole shop agwine he would ! " 

" I say, keep off, can't you ! " said Adolph, enraged. 

" Lor, now, how touchy we is we white niggers ! Look 
at us, now ! " and Sambo gave a ludicrous imitation of 
Adolph's manner ; " here's de airs and graces. We's been 
in a good family, I 'spects." 

" Yes," said Adolph ; " I had a master that could have 
bought you all for old truck ! " 

" Laws, now, only think," said Sambo, " the gentlemens 
that we is ! " 

" I belonged to the St. Clare family," said Adolph proudly. 

" Lor, you did ! Be hanged if they ar'n't lucky to get 
shet of ye. 'Spects they's gwine to trade ye off with a lot 
o' cracked tea-pots and sich like ! " said Sambo, with a 
provoking grin. 

Adolph, enraged at this taunt, flew furiously at his 
adversary, swearing and striking on every side of. him. The 
rest laughed and shouted, and the uproar brought the keeper 
to the door. 

" What now, boys ? Order, order ! " he said, coming in 
and flourishing a large whip. 

All fled in different directions, except Sambo, who, 
presuming on the favour which the keeper had to him as 
a licensed wag, stood his ground, ducking his head 





with a facetious grin whenever the master made a dive 
at him. 

" Lor, mas'r, 'tan't us we's reg'lar stiddy it's these yer 
new hands ; they's real aggravatin' kinder pickin' at us, all 
time ! " 

The keeper at this turned upon Tom and Adolph, and 
distributed a few kicks and cuffs without much inquiry, and, 
leaving general orders for all to be good boys and go to 
sleep, left the apartment.
