So was I, but not with admiration for the taste dis- 
played. I said it was a lovely quality, and a beautiful 
but trying color. 

“And Martha’s no real need of working, either,” ap- 
pended aunt Hetty triumphantly. 

“La, aunt Hetty ! whatever should I do with my time? 





I couldn’t dawdle round all day, cooking a few meals and 
washing up dishes.” 

“ That’s just the way I used to feel about it. My ! the 
dollars and dollars I’ve earned stitching shoes ! And then 
that we should have lent it to uncle Jason, and lost it 
all! ” and aunt Hetty sighed. “But the new'-fashioned 
wives don’t worry themselves much about earning money : 
and I hope Stephen appreciates his wife ; for he might 
hunt a long while, and not find one so smart.” 

Martha laughed, and tossed her head. “ I guess he 
does, aunt Hetty. We mean to be rich, if there’s any 
such thing in the calendar. Then I’ll take my turn read- 
ing novels, and playing planners, when I can afford to ride 
in my carriage. I haven’t the time to waste now.” 

Did that mean us? We read novels, and played a little ; 
yet we seemed to do as much work as most people. Aunt 
Hetty here never had made a dress for herself, nor had 
a child to take care of; and to mamma had come six 
babies. 

It was a stream of gossip and conunent until supper- 
time. Uncle Frank and Stephen came in ; and my heart 
gave a great bound. No James was with them. 

They talked of the war and of business. Stephen had 
made two contracts that he thought were very fortunate. 
They did seem to be prospering. I thought of poor 
papa. 

Stephen went out again to the office. Uncle Frank 
took his easy-chair and paper, read, and dozed. The 
clock struck eight. I could go home pretty soon. 

Oh, grief! Stephen and James entered. 

“ I told Jim we had our bridesmaid here,” said Steph- 
en, with a jolly but rather coarse laugh. “ Somehow, we 
don’t see much of you, Chris.” 

“ There is so much to do !” I said. “ And mother was 
BO worn in father’s sickness, that we girls try to save her 
all we can.” 


 


“Your father ought to go out West for two or three 
months. He’s had an awful tight squeeze this winter too, 
hasn’t he? — We’re lucky, father, in having something 
people must buy. Furniture is rather at a discount;” 
and his self-elated chuckle made me angry. 

Presently I rose to go. 

“You’ll see her safely home, Jim. An old married 
man like me is generally counted out.” 

“ If some one will just put me in the car,” I said 
coldly: “ I don’t mind the ride alone. It is such a dis- 
tance to any one who has to come back again ! ’ ’ 

“ I might go farther than that if I had occasion,” was 
the dry rejoinder. 

We said our good-bys. Martha kissed me warmly. 
“ Now do act sensibly,” she whispered. 

I drew a long, decisive breath, that had the effect of 
mentally bracing me. Just as we turned into Main Street, 
I heard a car. 

“ Let us hurry a little,” I said. “ If I lose that, I 
must wait fifteen minutes.” 

“ \Yliich would kill you,” ironically. “ It is a nice 
night ; and I thought you were fond of walking. No, 
you can’t catch that.” 

“ They would stop, if you called. Oh, do ! ” and my 
voice was tremulous with vexation. 

“Well, I don’t want them to. I’ve something to say 
to you ; and, now that I have the chance, I’m bound to 
say it. I’ve grown so dumpy about it, that even Steve 
noticed it, and said, if I had an ounce of courage, I’d 
settle the matter one way or the other.” 

It had to come, then ! My heart beat horribly with a 
guilty feeling. 

“You must have known or guessed, Chrissie, that I 
haven’t been dancing around after you the last six months 
for nothing. I love you. I want you to marry me. 
There, the murder’s out ! Come, now : be sensible.” 



Just what Martha had said. “ O James ! ” I faltered, 
striving to release myself from the grasp of his hand. 

“ Don’t say no, Chrissie. I’ll do any thing for you. 
I can give you a nice home, and pretty clothes ; and you
shall have your own way in every thing. If you like to 
keep a servant, no one shall laugh you out of it ; and you 
needn’t so much as soil your pretty hands. Say yes, 
dear ; do ! ” 

“O James! I will not affect to despise these things; 
but there is something else ’ ’ — 

“You’re thinking of that Sargent chap. Men of his 
stamp don’t treat a wife any better’n I should. They’re 
Aard and selfish to live with, if they are fair on the out- 
ride. And how do you know he wants you? ” 

“ I don’t know,” I replied with cold dignity. “It is 
iiot my habit to speculate, as soon as I meet a person, 
whether he wants to marry me or not. I have no idea 
that Mr. Sargent does. Please leave him out of the 
question.” 

“ But you have been different since the first night you 
met him.” 

“ I have been a little cool and distant since I began to 
suspect you were caring for me in this way. I thought 
you would see, and save yourself the pain,” I answered 
bravely, but with mental disquietude. 

“ Well, why can’t you marry me, if you don’t care for 
him? ” he asked obtusely. 

“ Because I do not love you, if you will have the plain 
truth.’* 

“ But you might try. Am I so much worse than other 
young men, because I haven’t been polished up into a 
lawyer or a doctor? Ten years from this time. I’ll engage 
to have as much money as that Sargent, or any other fine 
chap.” 

I was exceedingly annoyed for a moment. Why should 
he refer so pertinaciously to Mr. Sargent? Then I remembered
the measure of the man. 


 


“ You are not worse at all. You are honest and kind 
and true, and will no doubt make some woman very 
happy. But we do not suit. I should not be able to 
make you content ; and, with the very best intentions on 
your part, you could not give me what I most desire. I 
cannot make you understand. I can only feel what it 
would be ; and I cannot take upon myself a life that would 
fret and jar at every turn. It would be treason and 
ingratitude to share your home, your love, to accept con- 
tinual elforts for my happiness, and yet only make you 
miserable. So do not think of me in that light. I am 
very sorry this happened.” 

“ But you might iry,” he persisted. 

I stopped short, my patience almost exhausted. 

“Mr. Miller,” I began again, this time in a decisive 
tone, “ I will confess to you that I have tried. It was 
then I found out how utterly impossible it would be, not 
from any fault on your part, but just from that incompati- 
bility of temperament which always renders a marriage 
miserable. That is all there is of it ; ” and I signalled a 
car. 

“ You’ll never find any one to love you any better,” he 
returned in a sullen tone. 

“That may be. Don’t feel compelled to go all the 
way with me;” for I was fain to say good-night then 
and there. 

He entered, however ; and we rode on in silence. My 
anger subsided a little, and I stole a timid glance at him. 
He was bitterly disappointed. Why could I not resolve 
to cast mj" lot among kindly, commonplace people ? To 
what height was I aspiring, that I should hold myself so 
regally above them? But to make this man master of my 
future life, and then to meet the man I might have hon- 
ored and loved, — no : I could not so mar the years to 
come, standing here, as I did, on the very threshold of 
youth. I had a good education, and was fitted to earn 




my own living. If my name were Smith, or Brown, oi 
something ugher ; but Miss Durant was rather styhsh, 
and I could endure it a few years longer. 

We walked our brief block, and stood on the doorstep. 
“Well,” he said in a sort of jerky fashion, “it isn’t 
my style to hang around after a girl when she’s given me 
the mitten fair and square : so good-bye. Miss Durant ; 
and I hope you’ll be able to suit yom-self.” 

‘ ‘ Good-by ; ’ ’ and we shook hands coldly'. 

Theo had come home from school, and gone to bed with 
a headache. I ran up to our room now, and found her 
better, and told her the whole unlucky episode. 

‘ ‘ I su})pose it had to culminate in that : but it is done 
with now ; and somehow I seem to understand that you 
wouldn’t be very happ}-" with him. It is a little more 
than the daily bread and potato, and a fine silk gown.” 

“ I wonder if I ever shall be happy, Theo? ” 

“ A contented mind, dear,” with droll sententiousness. 
“ Well, there is the end of one trouble.” 

But it was not the end. A week afterward I came 
home one day to find aunt Hetty sitting by the window 
with her sewing. She greeted me very cooly. 

“Now you are in for it,” said Theo with a funny little 
moue. “ Mamma has had her sermon on the folly of 
bringing up girls to despise honest young men, and expect 
to marry lords.” 

“ I am sure we do not owe aunt Hetty any thing,” I 
cried indignantly. “ She hasn’t taken one of us to bring 
up, or even made us a handsome present in all our lives ; 
and mother has altered her old dresses, and trimmed her 
bonnets, to save a quarter.” 

I re-arranged my hair, changed my dress, and dawdled 
a while. All this, no doubt, helped to steep the rod in 
pickle. She lost no time when I did come. 

“ What was I thinking about to let such a chance slip? 
The Millers were one of the solid old famihes of North- 


 


wood ; so well connected too. And the boys were so 
enterprising, so steady ! none of your dancing, flirting 
fellows.” Janies was extravagantly fond of dancing, 
though he did it in the heavy style. “ Martha never had to 
stay at home alone, unless Stephen was out on some im- 
portant business. Did I know school-teachers were gen- 
erally old maids ; so queer that men seldom cared to marry 
them ! What was I waiting for ? She should think 
mother would be only too glad to marry off one of her 
girls when Joseph’s business was so poor, and so many 
likely young men being killed in the war. Husbands 
would not grow on every bush after this, as we’d And.” 

“ Aunt Hetty,” I said, “ I suppose you married the 
man of your choice.” 

“ Well, I don’t know as there was much choice about 
it. I didn’t mean to be an old maid, if I could help it, 
and your uncle Frank asked me. He was a good, steady 
man ; and I didn’t go into all this high-flown nonsense 
and spiritualism about sjmipathy and affinity, and what 
not. Girls have their hands so full of reading and plays, 
and trash of all kinds, that they can’t tell a good man 
when they see him. Take my word for it, Chrissie 
Durant, you’ll live to be sorry that you ever refused James 
Miller.” 

“Then I’ll be sorry,” I answered defiantly. “I 
esteem him more highly than you ; for I want him to have 
a wife who loves him, and you want me to marry him for 
the sake of a home. I can make my own home.” 

“ Well, I don’t understand all these new-fangled notions 
about love,” jerking her chin in the air. “ He wants you, 
and you could make him happy enough, if you had a mind 
to try. If aiiy thing happened to your father, you might 
be thankful for a good husband ; and I’m sure you’ve had 
warnings with these two long fevers.” 

“ Aunt Hetty, we won’t say another word about it,” 
I cried in exasperation. “ If it is my fate to be an old 





maid I will accept it with resignation, and never blame 
you. Now let us talk of something else.” 

But aunt Hetty was not to be mollified. After tea I 
was taankful to put her in the car en route for home. It 
led to a great coolness between the Montagues and Capu- 
lets ; and aunt Hetty never cordialty forgave me. 

Sprivig came on apace. As I said, we were trying our 
utmost at economy. We pulled out our old last year’s 
gowns, and considered ; for every thing was very high, and 
men’s hearts were quaking for fear. We did not know 
that Grant was to sit down and thunder at Richmond, and 
Sherman to come up by the sea, when, lo ! war would be 
at an end. But new enlistments were going on, and drafts 
had begun. The country" was rolling up a fearful burthen 
of debt. 

Archie kept pretty well. He had been in several bat- 
tles, and escaped miraculously, it seemed to us. He was 
very enthusiastic, and bound to see the end of it, if it 
took ten years. He often telegraphed after a battle just 
that one magic word, “ Safe,” and we were content. 

But we began to feel quite poor. My money that came 
promptty every month melted aw"ay so fast ! I had once 
saved fifty dollars ; but it had gone to help pay doctor’s 
bill and the girl for two months. Now we said, “ The 
pique will make over for Ardella, and her Leghorn hat will 
look pretty with Theo’s blue velvet and feathers ; but she 
must have boots, gloves, and parasol.” 

“ I shall not want any thing,” said mamma, “ except 
to have my Neapolitan pressed : there is quite enough in 
the house to trim it. I am so thankful I bought my nice 
lace shawl when goods were reasonable ! But Dick must 
have a new suit of clothes, and I hate to run up any 
bills.” 

When I received niy April’s salary, I took Dick out, 
and treated him to a new suit of pretty cadet-gray cloth. 
The three pieces were seventeen dollars ; hat, three ; shoes, 


 


four ; gloves and half a dozen new pairs of socks, two 
and a half : but he would be off our hands now for nearly 
all summer. Little mother had so many things to think 
about, that I was learning to save her perplexity. 

And one that troubled us very much was Theo. Her 
distressing headaches came more frequently. She had no 
appetite ; and often she would look so deadly pale, then a 
few hours afterward she would be brilliant and blooming. 
She was bright and ambitious, so full of fun and nonsense, 
that you could hardly tell whether it was any thing serious 
or not. But one day in school she dropped down in a 
dead faint, and was brought home in a carriage. Dr. 
Sheldon was summoned. 

For a week Theo lay quiet in bed ; not much fever, not 
much of any thing, it seemed, only when she fell into a doze 
she looked just as if she were dead. 

“ She has been stud}ing too hard,” said the doctor. 

She must not go back to school again, and she must not 
sew a stitch on the machine. Get her off somewhere to 
the country, and let her lie around under the trees, and 
hear the birds sing. And she may read some very fool- 
ish novels, — the kind one goes to sleep over.” 

“ But I wanted to graduate. And every week is so 
precious ! ” The tears filled Theo’s eyes. 

“ You won’t graduate this year, my dear child. If you 
care to live at all, you must be careful. You have a pe- 
culiar nervous organization. If you think of teaching 
school, I may as well tell you here and now, that you 
cannot stand it. You will have to be the home girl, 
changing about in your employments, and easing your- 
self up here and there when you are tired.” 

A fortnight passed ; and Theo was still weak and lan- 
guid, with queer faint spells. She laughed, and told the 
doctor they were just like Mrs. Sandborn’s hysterics. 
Mrs. Sandborn was a neighbor of ours, a pretty, delicate 
married woman, who boasted of ha\ung a complaint that 





puzzled all the doctors. She couldn’t sew, she couldn’t 
even dust a room, nor take the least care of her two 
children. Her two servants and Mr. Sandborn attended 
to every thing. She spent most of her time on the bed, 
di’essed in the prettiest of wrappers, reading novels, or 
entertaining company. Friends took her out driving; 
and it was astonishing how long she could sit up in a car- 
riage, or how well she could stand parties. Lizz}-, the 
nursemaid, said, if Mr. Sandborn ever refused her any 
thing, she always had one of her spells in the night, when 
she was sure she was going to die, and had the doctor 
brought, and occasionally sent for dear friends to receive 
her dying-messages. Dr. Sheldon had offended her irre- 
mediably by calling it hysterics. 

He laughed a little at Theo now, but was ver}- earnest 
that she should do no more studjdng. And indeed it did 
seem useless to go back to school ; for she could not 
regain the lost time at this period of the session. 

One fine June day I rushed home after some tiresome 
examinations, in which my class had seemed fearfully stu- 
pid, it appeared to me. There sits Theo up in our room, 
cool and sweet, fashioning a dainty dotted Suisse for sum- 
mer-wear, out of our two old skirts. On the bureau are 
ranged three hats that will be the envy of the street, the 
work of her fairy-fingers, nmnerous odds and ends, and 
a dollar or two of fresh expense. I do believe Theo was 
born to be an artist ; and yet she has musical hands and 
a musical throat. 

‘ ‘ O Theo ! ” I cry ‘ ‘ there is the most splendid thing 
on foot, and I’ve joined for you and myself, — a whole 
month in a quaint little place on Long Island, where there 
is sea and bathing and rowing, and a farm, and a great 
roomy old house ; oh, and a horse ! and a party of teach- 
ers are going down to keep house. We can have all our 
fruit and vegetables and milk ; and it will be too gay for 
any thing.” 


 


“Indeed!” and Theo shakes out yards of mflling. 
“ Whose house may be so hospitably inclined? ” 

“ The plan is Miss Newby’s. Her aunt and uncle own 
the farm ; but they want to go to Maine for a month, and 
have asked Mrs. Newby to come down and look after the 
place. So she proposed to bring some friends, and run 
the house, pacing the man’s wages. Eight ladies beside 
the Newbys can go. We are to do our own housework, 
and will only have to buy meat and flour, and a few 
things : Miss Newby thinks it will not be more than 
three dollars a week. Then it costs about two and a half 
to get there. Several gentlemen will be invited for the 
last week. It will be royal.” 

“Five, ten, for travelling,” counts Theo; “six — 
twenty-four for board, thirty-four, and, say, ten for inci- 
dentals : can you, Chris ? It is so good of you to think 
of it! ” 

“ Why, with July’s money, I shall have over forty 
dollars; and there will be August’s when I come back, 
to make up deflciencies. We have been so very economi- 
cal this summer ! Miss Newby will be here to-morrow to 
talk it over. I have quite set my heart upon it.” 

“ Oh, it seems too nice to come true ! ” cries Theo with 
glistening eyes. 


CHAPTER YIII. 


Have given you here a thread of mine own life.” 

Tempest. 

Miss Newby came, and we talked it over. Father and 
mother both liked it. To be sure, I had thought a year 
ago I should go to Niagara ; but a week’s pleasure would 
not be so good for Theo as a whole month’s change. Dr. 
Sheldon indorsed it warmly, with one very strict prohibi- 
tion. On no account must Theo go in bathing, unless the 
water was very warm and very smooth ; but he would 
rather that she would not go in at all. 

We send Dick off to a second or third cousin at Med- 
ford, who says he shall be glad to have him to do little 
chores : so there will be only mother and Dell at home. 

Now that school has ended, I feel how tired I am. I 
pack away clothes to alter or furbish up while we are in 
the country. We go out to tea once or twice, and on one 
lovely moonlight excursion. Mr. Sargent is our escort. 
We have seen him at intervals, and like him so much. 

Ah, how delicious it is to dance to the dreamy rhythm 
of the waves and the beguiling music, that sounds so en- 
chanting at night and on the water ! The horns quiver ; 
the cornet sends out wafts and trills of melody ; fine and 
clear whistle the fiutes ; and oh the violins ! — passionate, 
tremulous, eager, trailing over space, palpitating on the 
air, stealing your very soul until your whole being 
throbs and thrills. Mr. Sargent essays a few qua- 
drilles ; then we sit down, and watch the others. Theo is 



waltzing now : with her it is poetry, harmony, a pure, 
beautiful dream. 

We talk first about the farm-house scheme. He has 
heard of it from Miss Newby. 

“ I have half a mind to get up a party, and start op- 
position. We mightn’t be able to make bread, perhaps ; 
but I can fry fish, and am quite celebrated for my oyster- 
stews.” 

“ Oh, do ! ” I replied. “ You might bring a tent, and 
become our next-door neighbor ; so that, if you met with 
any mishaps, we could enjoy them.” 

“You wicked girl ! ” 

Then we lapse into other subjects, — books we have 
read, music we have heard, and stumble over that pecu- 
liar, delicate, soul-stirring “ Counterparts.” I instance 
Rafe’s strange honeymoon, Cecilia’s visit and her music, 
and, last of all, the night in the boat when Rafe talks to 
her and at her, and makes his admission, lays bare the 
secret of his life, at once so pathetic and so passionless. 

“ Oh ! ” I cry, “ why were they so fatally blind? They 
might have been so happy ! ’ ’ 

“I wonder,” and there comes a strange dreaminess 
into Horace Sargent’s eyes, “if it is best that one should 
have a life of happiness? Wouldn’t the perfect bhss 
exhaust, enervate ? ” 

“ Why should it? I think the effort to make one’s 
self content, or rather persuade one’s self that something 
is happiness which is not really, exhausts much more. 
Was Rose happy? Did not those two souls, both so 
lovehMn themselves, wear upon each other until — well, 
there was nothing left but for one of them to die? ” 

“ And the fatal blindness doesn’t stop there. How 
can one help growing out of some loves aiiy more than of 
some phases ot existence? Yet there is honor and truth 
always. But I wonder which would be best, — one wild, 
delicious draught, and gray dregs afterward, or common- 





place loves and enjoyments ; for, strange to relate, these 
highly- wrought episodes seldom do last.” 

Was it a question to be answered. Did my evil genius 
possess me to say recklessly ? — 

“ Oh let the solid earth 

Not fail beneath my feet 
Until that I have found 
What some have found so sweet ; 

Then let come what come may: 

What matter if I go mad ? 

I shall have had my day.” 

“ Ah, you think that ! I hope you may find it — hap- 
pily. Listen to that strain.” 

Remember I was but nineteen, and had great faith in 
the possibilities of love. 

Then we go to dancing again. Oh, happy, happy 
night ! 

The middle of July, word is sent from Mrs. Newby that 
she is ready to receive us. We pack our trunks ; and on 
Tuesday morning the party begin a confused medley of 
horse and steam car, ferry-boats, train, and lastly a stage, 
which is crowded full, while the wagon with Adam Kent 
takes the trunks and two passengers. It is not a very 
romantic ride through scrub- oaks and pines ; but pres- 
ently we come in sight of a scattering village that slopes 
down to the great South Bay. Over beyond is the Atlan- 
tic. Trees are a little larger, though many of them curi- 
ously awry ; fields are better cultivated ; and the face of 
Nature appears more hospitable. 

The stage-driver turns in the lane to the Holworthy 
Place, which is off the main road. It is a gi’eat, low, 
weather-worn, old-fashioned house, with a wide door-yard, 
and roomy porch, Mrs. Newby comes out to welcome us. 
Such a clatter of tongues, and exclamations in every key 
and of every nature ! Adam shoulders trunk after trunk. 
Two or three go on the ground-floor ; ours up stairs. 


 


Theo and I have a corner-room, where the roof slopes 
down on the one side, and is broken by a queer little 
dormer-window, while the other has a larger window over- 
looking distant fields and houses, and a long stretch of 
seashore. A finely-cut rag-carpet, that is really a work 
of art, covers the fioor ; a great high-post bedstead and 
chest of drawers that might have come over in ‘ ‘ The May- 
flower,” a fragrance of sweet-clover and dried rose-leaves 
in sheets and blankets and everyhere. 

There are three chambers up stairs and a space of open 
garret, in which are hanging all manner of dried herbs, that 
give out a pungent smell. Six girls go up, and four stay 
down, — two in the best spare room off the parlor, Mrs. 
Newby and Miss Helen taking the other. There is a 
state-parlor that boasts an ingrain-carpet, and those 
wretched chairs compounded of mahoganj" and horse-hair, 
and a great clawfoot table. But the living-room — with 
its rag-carpet, its home-made, chintz-covered lounge, with 
ample seat, its capacious, rush-bottomed, quaint arm-chairs 
— is so cosey and enjoyable ! It resembles some stout, 
jolly, generous-hearted matron ; while the parlor looks like 
a tall, thin, angular spinster of forbidding aspect. 

Beyond it all was a roomy kitchen and woodshed ; and 
from thence you entered the vegetable-garden, or wallved 
down to the barn, — up I should have said. 

We wash off layers of sand and dust, get into clean 
sacks and wrappers, and come to Mrs. Newby’s delight- 
ful tea. Ten women, — seven are school-teachers, one a 
musician, Mrs. Newby, and Theo. She and I are the 
youngest of the group : the others range from twenty-two 
to twenty-eight. 

There is bread, biscuit, delicious butter, cold chicken 
and ham, milk, tea and coffee, and sugar-cookies. We 
sit a good hour over our supper, and then have a merry 
time clearing it away. A fragmentary, sleepy chat on the 
porch follows ; and then we go to bed. 




Adam was up with the lark the next morning ; but we 
were not. We had come for rest ; and there was to be no 
six-o’clock breakfast, so harrowing to comfort-loving people. 

We planned at the breakfast-table. Two girls would 
help Mrs. Newby each week ; two more would sweep and 
dust. The washerwoman was to come on Friday, and we 
were to do our own ironing. I proffered mine and Theo’s 
services for the first week. 

Adam was quite busy with the farm- work, which was to 
go on as usual, though we could have the horse part of the 
time. But the next-door neighbor, Capt’n Wright as every- 
body termed him, came over and offered us his team occa- 
sionally, which he assured us were “spanking fine ponies ; ” 
and so they were. He and Mrs. Wright were very jolly 
people ; but the son, about thirty, was mortally afraid of 
us, and dodged out of sight the instant he saw one of us. 
Other people dropped in to view the houseful of women. 

Miss Newby had selected her party with tact and taste. 
We soon settled to our routine, and did very well. I had 
quite a fancy for cooking ; but we so abounded in berries 
and fruit, that desserts were easily managed. We went 
out bathing every day ; we rode ; wo drove, and walked a 
little ; lounged on the porch a good deal. 

We counted up our expenses the first week ; $5.00 for 
Adam; $1.00 for the washerwoman; flour, sugar, and 
butter, $4.10; fresh meat, $3.60; poultry, $3.00; ham, 
$1.80 ; eggs, .90, —not quite $20.00 ; and “ nothing for 
the fun,” said some one. 

The second week we were out yachting and fishing, and 
went to a clam-bake, where there was a black fiddler ; and 
we improvised an impromptu Hop on the hard sand of the 
beach. 

We did have the gayest of all gay times ; and such re- 
freshing rest, such heavenly sleeping ! as Theo said. She 
was a great favorite with all the girls. Miss Wilbur, our 
musician, was quite struck with her voice, which was a 


 


very pure contralto, she said. I only knew that Theo 
could sing old ballads in a most pathetic manner. She 
had another accomplishment too, repeating poetry, which 
she seemed to learn by instinct. Many an evening we sat 
round and listened. 

The second week engagements multiplied upon us. We 
were actually asked out to tea, the whole party : we were 
taken to the hotel, seven miles distant, for a hop. Our 
going was a “ straw-ride ; ” but we came home in the “ wee 
sma’ hours,” half asleep, and bundled into bed. 

The third week it was resolved by a committee of the 
whole to invite some gentlemen. They were getting to be 
somewhat of a rarity ; indeed were absolutely scarce in this 
little \dllage, so many having gone to war. Capt. Wright 
promised to lodge our guests ; and we were to provide the 
meals, as there were no near hotel accommodations. There 
was Mr. Wilbur ; a Capt. Norcross, home on a furlough, 
and engaged to Miss Stent ; a Mr. Cope, one of the high- 
school teachers, that we all liked ; and Mr. Sargent. Miss 
Newby wrote all the imitations ; and they were accepted to 
a man. During Friday and Saturday they all made their 
appearance. 

It had been gay before ; but now it was riotous. We 
had a piano hired for a month, and Mr. Wilbur brought 
his flute. One young man in the neighborhood played on 
a violin. We had a yacht, and were gone nearly two days ; 
we gave one brilliant party, taking up the parlor and hall 
carpet that we might dance with no compunctions. And 
so ended our fourth week : at least we came to Saturday. 
The Holworthys would not return until Friday of the 
ensuing week. 

Two of the gentlemen went home on Saturday, two on 
Monday. Then we cleared up, restored every thing to 
its pristine loveliness, and looked over accounts. They 
stood thus: first week, 19.40; second, $17.60; third, 
$18.00 ; fourth, $26.00 : a total of $81.00. We were quite 





amazed at this showing, and unanimously insisted that 
Mrs. Newby’s share should be divided up among the 
others, which, after all, "would only make nine dollars 
apiece. 

“ I wonder that people don’t often agree to do such 
things,” said Miss Wilbur. “ Of course we have paid 
nothing for house-rent or vegetables ; but I think city and 
country people might often change to the advantage of 
both.” 

“ Aunt Holworthy is none the loser,” said Miss 
Newby “ Her butter, eggs, and poultry have been sold ; 
mother has canned and preserved for her ; and much of 
the fruit and vegetables would have gone to waste any- 
how, as there is no near market. They two have had a 
pleasant month visiting ; and nothing here has suffered. 
And We have had a very cheap summering. I hope you 
are all satisfied.” 

We declared that we were. 

Our incidentals for pleasure had been seven dollars ; 
our travelling in all would be eleve». I had not ex- 
ceeded my forty dollars. What a grand, happy time it 
had been ! 

On Wednesday we returned, and were received with 
open arms. Theo looked so much improved, that mamma 
was very happy over it. She had taken the month quite 
liglitly ; but papa was so pale and thin, that it went to my 
heart. 

“ I do feel worried,” mamma admitted. “ I was think- 
ing, after you came home we might go to Medford for a 
week or two. The business and the state of the country 
worry him greatly ! No one can tell what the result will be ; 
and yet it seems as if the North must be victorious. 
There is so little to do, except for those employed upon 
government work ; and the necessaries of life are growing 
higher every week. Now that bounties are paid, the 
indebtedness of cities and towns must add up rapidly. 
What the taxes w'ill be by and by I dread to think.” 


 


“ But some people agree that national debts are bless- 
ings, and bring about a higher state of unity and pros- 
perity.” 

“ I can not think any debt a blessing. We feel the 
interest of our mortgage very sensibly.” 

“ You are not a pohtical economist, little mother,” I 
said gayly. 

“But I am a household economist ; and when the juices 
of some articles are increased a third or a half, while your 
income decreases, it doesn’t seem to me that you get 
rich. Countries may have a different method of calculating. 

“But about going away. We can keep house now; 
and if you could start the last of the week ’ ’ — 

“Yes, I think father ought. If he could leave business- 
cares behind him. I sometimes wish he had let the store 
go last winter ; but it did seem so hard to give up the work 
of ten years.” 

“We’ll hope for better times.” Somehow I couldn’t 
help feeling well and joyous and haj?py, strong enough to 
fight any battle. 

Theo and I persuaded father to go, and we worked on 
Friday like heroes to get them off. Dell went with them. 

Theo and I, with the assistance of the washerwoman, 
cleaned all the house, except the kitchen. It was not so 
very hard wiping off paint ; and there was not very much 
of that, as most of our woodwork had been stained a 
little, and then brightened with a coat of oil and shellac. 
It was kept neat and clean with much less labor than the 
scrubbing of paint. We washed windows, took up one 
or two carpets, swept and dusted, and then began at our 
fall clothes. We made some calls, and had in several of 
our girl-friends to tea. 

“ I wish I knew just what to do,” Theo said one after- 
noon, when she had been sitting in a brown study for ever 
so long. “ About going back to school, I mean, or doing 





something. I shouldn’t like teaching ; but I suppose I 
could do it. Then there is music ; but, oh ! could I endure 
the hammering of children on the piano, and then’ atrO' 
cious blunders ! I know what I would like to do.” 

“ What? ” I glanced up, all attention. 

“ Cultivate my voice, and sing. Chris, I felt, after what 
Miss Wilbur said, that it had a possibility.” 

“O Theo, the very thing! And there is church and 
concert singing.” 

“I suppose I’d like to be a prima donna;” and she 
laughed and blushed, looking prettier than ever. “ I 
would really, Chris, and have an admiring world at my 
feet. But of course I cannot aim at any thing so high as 
that. If I could earn a little money, and do it easily, and 
stay home to help mother for a while.” 

“ Dear Theo, let us call on Miss Wilbur, and see what 
a little good training would cost. I’ll pay for the lessons.” 
“ You dear, darling old Chris ! ” And spools, scissors, 
and work flew in every direction, while she kissed me 
rapturously. 

“ If I could earn some money of my own, Chris, and 
if we could take little tours together ! You have not been 
to Niagara yet, you know, and if you could save it until I 
was rich enough ! I don’t know why ; but somehow we 
do enjoy every thing in so much the same fashion. Oh, 
if papa only was rich ! He ought to be : he has worked 
so hard, and been so saving ! Chris, I’m getting to be 
awfully heterodox. I am afraid the hand of the diligent 
doesn’t always gather riches. Isn’t there something like 
that in the Bible? And you know Lu Gidding’s father 
failed in the spring, and she and her mother are at Sara- 
toga. Could we have so many indulgences if papa failed? 
Oh my ! what a rambling sermon ! To return to thq 
text, it seems as if I ought to do something ; and whether 
it is best to go to school again ” — 

“Yes, I thinli I would, Theo. There would be only


 


about three months of real studjung, and then you would 
have your diploma.” 

‘ ‘ But the headaches were so horrible ; and I feel so 
well now ! Still it will be very easy all winter, going over 
the old things. Maybe it would be better.” 

We called on Miss Wilbur. She was alone, and insisted 
upon Theo’s trying her voice according to method and 
scale. Oh, how beautiful it was in those rich, soft, flow- 
ing notes ! and half sauce" and defiant in the clear, crisp 
staccato. 

“ Yes, I should advise you to study music. You can 
make a charming singer ; and a contralto voice is something 
to be proud of. Now, Miss Theo, I am a good deal inter- 
ested in you, and I will make you an offer. My terms are 
twenty dollars a quarter ; but I will take you for twelve 
this year, partly for the pleasure of teaching you.” 

We concluded our bargain, not without a warm expres- 
sion of thanks ; then we came home, and Theo threw 
herself on the sofa. I prepared our frugal meal. 

‘ ‘ How pale you look ! ” I said as she came to the 
table. 

“ Do I? Somehow I feel tired.” 

“ You sang too much.” 

“ But it was so fascinating ! ” 

She went back to the sofa, and lay there all the evening. 
I picked out a few tunes on the piano ; then we tallied of 
the future, but went to bed early. 

Mr. Sargent dropped in twice. Our travellers came 
home improved, certainly. Mother had been laying in a 
store of country things, — butter, potatoes, apples, and so 
on, at less than the usual store-prices. 

“We must be just as economical as we can, this winter,” 
mother said. “Our coal is in, and paid for, and I have 
reduced my house-keeping allowance to twelve dollars a 
week.” 

Mother rather insisted that Theo should go back to 





school. She would he seventeen in October ; and Dell 
would be fifteen in December. She was growing into a 
tall girl, not as ambitious over her books as we had 
been. 

I had so much courage that autumn ! I liked my new 
class pretty well. Theo and I took up a little French read- 
ing, as Mr. Sargent said it would be a pleasure for him to 
spend one evening every week over it with us, and be a 
good practice for him. What an elegant scholar he was ! 
He had been abroad, and spent nearly a year at Paris. 

Early in October, Archie had a furlough of ten days, 
and came flying home. How strangely he had changed ! 
He was thin, but seemed to have grown taller, and held 
up his head with such a martial air. He brought a wave 
of strength and hopefulness, he infused so much courage 
into us all. We talked and laughed over old friends, and 
my loAX-episode was confessed. Theo’s beaux were a 
source of unfailing amusement to him. What had we 
heard of Alfred Dayton? 

“ Oh ! ” said Theo, “ he was drafted a few weeks ago, 
and wanted to go dreadfully ; but his mother cried and 
went on so ; and they procured him a substitute : so he is 
back at college.” 

‘ ‘ It would be a good thing to take the nonsense out of 
him,” declared Archie. 

We had one magnificent afternoon out in the woods about 
four miles from Northwood, nutting. Mr. Sargent went 
with us. He seemed to have taken a wonderful fancy to 
Archie. How we laughed and told stories, went, by turns, 
from grave to gay, sang in the depths of the fragrant 
woods, gathered leaves, mosses, and nuts, and hated to 
return ! 

But, oh to part with him again ! 

“ Don’t worry about me,” he said. “ I begin to think 
now that I have a charmed life, and shall see the struggle 
through to a glorious ending. So you must be brave as
