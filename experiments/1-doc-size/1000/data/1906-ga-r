replied with a fulsome apology for not repairing 
at once to the Juno to welcome his distinguished 
guest in person, and, pleading his age and the one 
hundred and seventy-five English miles he had 
ridden from Monterey, begged him as a younger 
man to waive informality, and dine at the house 
of the Comandante that very day. Eezanov 
had complied as a matter of course, and now he 
was alone with the men who held his fate in their 
hands. The dark worn rugged face of Don Jose, 
who had been skilfully prepared by his oldest 
daughter to think well of the Eussian, beamed 
with good-will and interest, in spite of lingering 



 

doubts ; but the lank wiry figure of the Governor, 
who was as dignified as only a blond Spaniard 
can be, was fairly rigid with the severe formality 
he reserved for occasions of ceremony— being a 
gentleman who loved good company and cheer— 
and his sharp gray eyes were almost shut in the 
effort to penetrate the designs of this deputy, this 
symbol, this index in cipher, of a dreaded race. 
Eezanov smoked calmly, made himself comfort- 
able on the slippery horse-hair chair, though with 
no loss of dignity, and beat about the bush with 
the others until the Governor betrayed himself 
at last by a chance remark. 

'' What you say of the neighborly instincts of 
the Eussian colonists for the Spanish on this coast 
interests me deeply, Excellency, but if Eussia is 
at war with Spain " 

" Eussia is not at war with Spain,'' said Eez- 
anov, with a flash of amusement in his half-closed 
eyes. " Napoleon Bonaparte is encamped about 
half-way between the two countries. They could 
not get at each other if they wished. "While that 
man is at large Europe will be at war with him, no 
two nations with each other." 

" Ah! '' exclaimed Arillaga. " That is a manner of reasoning that had not occurred to me." 



 

The Comandante had spat at the mention of 
the usurper's name and muttered " Chinch osa! " 
and Eezanov, recalling his first conversation with 
Concha, looked into the honest eyes of the mon- 
archist with a direct and hearty sympathy. 

" No better epithet for him, ' ' he said. " And 
the sooner Europe combines to get rid of him 
the better. But until it does, count upon a com- 
mon grievance to unite your country and mine." 

" Good! '' muttered the Governor. '' Good! I 
am glad that nightmare has lifted its bat's wings 
from our poor California. Captain 'Cain's raid 
two years ago made me apprehensive, for he took 
away some eleven hundred of our otter skins and 
Ms hunters were Aleutians— subjects of the Tsar. 
A negro that deserted gave the information that 
they were furnished the Bostonian by the chief - 
manager of your Company — Baranhov — whose 
reputation we know well enough!— for the deliberate purpose of raiding our coast." 

Eezanov shrugged his shoulders and replied 
indifferently: "" I will ask Baranhov when I return 
io Sitka, and write you the particulars. It is more 
likely that the Aleutians were deserters. This 
O'Cain would not be the first shrewd Bostonian 
to tempt them, for they are admirable hunters 



 

and ready for any change. Tliey make a greater 
demand upon the Company for variety of diet 
than we are always prepared to meet, so many 
are the difficulties of transportation across Siberia. When, therefore, the time arrived that I 
could continue my voyage I determined to come 
here and see if some arrangement could not be 
made for a bi-yearly exchange of commodities. 
We need farinaceous stuffs of every sort. I will 
not pay so poor a compliment to your knowledge 
of the northern settlements as to enlarge upon 
the advantages California would reap from such 
a treaty." 

The Governor, who had permitted himself to 
touch the back of his chair after the dispersal of 
the war cloud, stiffened again. '' Ah! " he said. 
" Ah! '' He looked significantly at the Coman- 
dante, who nodded. " You come on a semi-official 
mission, after all, then? " 

" It is entirely my own idea,'' said Rezanov 
carelessly. " The young Tsar is too much occu- 
pied with Bonaparte to give more than a passing 
thought to his colonies. But I have a free hand. 
Can I arrange the preliminaries of a treaty, 
I have only to return to St. Petersburg to receive 
his signature and highest approval. It would be 




a great feather in my cap, I can assure your ex- 
cellencies,' he added, with a quick human glance 
and a sudden curve of his somewhat cjniical 
mouth. 

" Um! '' said the Governor. " Um! '' 
But Argiiello's stem face had further relaxed. 
After all, he was but eleven years older than the 
Eussian, and although early struggles and heavy 
responsibilities and many disappointments had 
deprived life of much of its early savor, what 
was left of youth in him responded to the ambition he divined in this interesting stranger. Moreover, the idea of a friendly bond with another race 
on the lonely coast of the Pacific appealed to him 
irresistibly. He turned eagerly to the Governor. 
" It is a fine idea. Excellency. We need much 
that they have, and it pleases me to think we 
should be able to supply the wants of others. 
Fancy anyone wanting aught of California, except hides, to be sure. I did not think our existence was known save to an occasional British or 
Boston skipper. It is true we are here only to 
Cliristianize savages, but even they have need of 
much that cannot be manufactured in this God- 
forsaken land. And we ourselves could be more 
comfortable— God in heaven, yes! It is well to 



 

think it over, Excellency. Who knows? — we 
might have a trip to the north once in a while. 
Life is more excellent with something to look forward to." 

" You should have a royal welcome. Baranov 
is the most hospitable man in Eussia, and I might 
have the happiness to be there myself. I see, by 
the way, that yon have not engaged in the industry of shipbuilding. I need not say that we 
should supply the ships of commerce with no diminution of your profits. We build at Okhotsk, 
Petropaulovski, Kadiak and Sitka. Moreover, as 
the Bostonians visit us frequently, and as your 
laws prohibit you from trading with them, we 
would see that you always got such of their commodities as you needed. They come to us for furs, 
and generally bring much for which we have no 
use. Captain D'Wolf, from whom I bought the 
Juno, had a cargo I was forced to take over. I 
unloaded what was needed at Sitka, but as there 
was no boat going for some months to the other 
islands, I brought the rest with me, and you are 
welcome to it, if in exchange you will ballast the 
Juno with samples of your agricultural products; 
while the treaty is pending I can experiment in 
our colonies and make sure which are the most 
adaptable to the market." 




" Urn! " said the Governor. " Urn! " 

Eezanov did not remove his cool direct gaze 
from the snapping eyes opposite. 

" I have not the least objection to making a 
trade that would fill my promuschleniki with joy; 
but that was by no means the first object of my 
voyage; which was partly inspired by a desire 
to see as much of this globe as a man may in one 
short life, partly to arrange a treaty that would 
be of incalculable benefit to both colonies and 
greatly redound to my own glory. I make no 
pretence of being disinterested. I look forward 
to a career of ever increasing influence and power 
in St. Petersburg, and I wish to take back as 
many credits as possible. '' 

" I understand, I understand ! " The Governor 
rested his lame back once more. " Your ambition 
is the more laudable, Excellency, since you have 
achieved so much already. I am not one to balk 
the honest ambition of any man, particularly when 
he does me the honor to take me into his confidence. I like this suggested measure. I like it 
much. I believe it would redound to our mutual 
benefit and reputation. Is it not so, Jose I '' 

The Comandante nodded vigorously. " I am 
sure of it! I am sure of it! I like it— much, 
much." ... ' 




" I will write at once to the Viceroy of Mexico 
and ask that he lay the matter before the Cabinet 
and King. Without that high authority we can 
do nothing. But I see no reason to doubt the 
issue when we, who know the wants and needs of 
California, approve and desire. We are doomed 
to failure in this unwieldy land of worthless savages, but it is the business of the wretched servants of a glorious monarch to do the best they 
can. " 

Eezanov had an inspiration. " You might remind the viceroy that Spain and the United States 
of America have been on the verge of war for 
years, and suggest the benefit of an alliance with 
Eussia in the case of the new country taking ad- 
vantage of the situation in Europe to extend its 
western boundaries " 

Arrillaga had bounced to his feet, his small 
eyes injected and blazing. " Those damned Bostonians ! " he shouted. " I distrusted them years 
ago. They have too much calculation in their 
bluntness. They cheated us, sold us short, traded 
under my very nose, stole our otters, until I ordered them never to drop an anchor in California 
waters again. If their ridiculous upstart government dares to cast its eyes on California we shall 




know how to meet tliem— the sooner they march 
on Mexico and lose their conceit the better. How 
they do brag! Faugh! It is sickening. I shall 
remember all you say, Excellency, and thank you 
for the hint.'' 

Rezanov rose, and the Comandante solemnly 
kissed him on either cheek. " Governor Arrillaga 
is my guest, Excellency," he said. " I beg that 
you will dine with us daily— unofficially— that 
you will regard California as your own kingdom, 
and come and go at your pleasure. And my 
daughter begs me to remind you and your young 
officers that there will be informal dancing every 
night. ' ' 

" So far so good," thought Eezanov, as he 
mounted his horse to return to the Juno. '' But 
what of my cargo? I fancy there will be more 
difficulty in that quarter." 



XV 

The Chamberlain was in a towering bad humor. As he made his appearance at least two 
hours earher than he was expected he found the 
decks of the Juno covered with the skins of sea- 
dogs, foxes and birds. He had heard Langsdorif 
go to his cabin later than usual the night before, 
and that his pet aversion was the cause of a fresh 
grievance, but hastened the eruption of his smouldering resentment toward life in general. 

" What does this mean! " he roared to the 
sailor on watch. " Clear them off — overboard, 
every one of them. What are you staring at? " 

The sailor, who was a " Bostonian,'' an inheritance with the ship, opened his mouth in favor 
of the unfortunate professor, but like his mates, 
he stood in much awe of a master whose indulgence demanded implicit obedience in return. 
Without further ado he flung the skins into the 
sea. 

Eezanov, to do him justice, would not have 
acted otherwise had he risen in the best of tempers. He had inflicted himself with the society 



 

of the learned doctor that he might always have 
a physician and surgeon at hand, as well as an 
interpreter where Latin was the one door of 
communication. He should pay him handsomely, 
make him a present in addition to the sum agreed 
upon, but he had not the least intention of giving 
up any of the Juno's precious space to the vagaries of a scientist, nor to submit to the pollution 
of her atmosphere. Langsdorif was his creature 
and the sooner he realized the fact the better. 

" Eemember,'' he said to the sailor, " no more 
of this, or it will be the worse for you — What is 
this ? ' ' He had come upon a pile of ducks, gulls, 
pelicans, and other aquatic birds. " Are these 
the cook's or the professor's? '' 

" The professor's. Excellency." 

" Overboard." And the birds followed the 
skins. 

Eezanov turned to confront the white and 
trembling Langsdorff. The naturalist was enfolded in a gorgeous Japanese dressing-gown, 
purple brocade embroidered with gold, that he 
had surreptitiously bought in the harbor of 
Nagasaki. To Eezanov it was like a red rag to 
a bull; but the Professor was oblivious at the 
moment of the tactless garment. His eyes were 




glaring and the extended tip of his nose worked 
like a knife trying to leap from its sheath. But 
although he occasionally ventured upon a retort 
when goaded too far in conversation, he was able 
to curb his just indignation when the Chamberlain 
was in a bad temper. In that vague gray under 
winking stars in their last watch, Rezanov seemed 
to tower six feet above him, 

" Excellency," he murmured. 

'' Well? '' 

" My — my specimens. " 

'' Your what? '' 

" The cause of science is very dear to me, Excellency. ' ' 

" So it is to me — in its proper place. Were 
those skins yours? '' His voice became very 
suave. " I am sorry you should have fatigued 
yourself for nothing, but I am forced to remind 
you that this is not an expedition undertaken for 
the promotion of natural history. I am not violating my part in the contract, I believe. Upon our 
arrival at Sitka you are at liberty to remain as 
my guest and make use of the first boat that sails 
for this colony; but for the present I beg that 
you will limit yourself to the requirements of 
your position on my staff.'' 




He turned his back and ordered a canoe to 
be lowered. Since the arrival of the Governor 
and Comandante, now three days ago, all 
restrictions on his liberty had been removed, 
and the phrases of hospitality were a trifle less 
meaningless. He had been asked to give his word 
to keep away from the fortifications, and as he 
knew quite as much of the military resources of 
the country as he desired, he had merely suppressed a smile and given his promise. 

This morning he wanted nothing but a walk. 
He had slept badly, the blood was in his head, 
his nerves were on edge. He went rapidly 
along the beach and over the steep hills that led 
to the northeastern point of the peninsula. But 
he had taken the walk before and did not turn his 
head to look at the great natural amphitheatre 
formed by the inner slopes of those barren 
heights, so uninteresting of outline from the 
water. Once when Luis had left him to go down 
with an order to the Battery of Yerba Buena he 
had examined it critically and concluded that 
never had there been so fine a site for a great city. 
Nor a more beautiful, with the broken line of the 
San Bruno mountains in the distance and a 
glimpse of the Mission valley just beyond this vast 




Colosseum, whose steep imposing lines were destined by nature to be set with palaces and bazaars, 
minarets and towers and churches, with a thousand gilded domes and slender crosses glittering 
in the crystal air and sun-flood. If not another 
Moscow, then an Irkutsk in his day, at least. 

But he did not give the chosen site of his city 
a glance to-day, although in this gray hour before 
dawn when mystery and imagination most closely 
embrace, he might at another time have forgotten 
himself in one of those fits of dreaming that 
slipped him out of touch with realities, and sometimes precipitated action in a manner highly gratifying to his enemies. 

But much as he loved Kussia, there were times 
when he loved his own way more, and since the 
arrival of Governor Arrillaga he was beginning to feel as he had felt in the harbor of Nagasaki. Not a word since that first interview had 
been said of his cargo; nor even of the treaty, 
although nothing could have been more natural 
than the discussion of details. Whenever he had 
delicately broached either subject he had been 
met with a polite indifference, that had little in 
common with the cordiality otherwise shown him. 
He foresaw that he might be obliged to reveal the 



 

more pressing object of his visit without further 
diplomacy, and the thought irritated him beyond 
endurance. 

Whether Concha were giving him her promised 
aid he had no means of discovering, and herein 
lay another cause of his general vexation. He 
had dined every day at the Comandante's, 
danced there every night. Concha had been vivacious, friendly — impersonal. Not so much as a 
coquettish lift of the brow betrayed that the distinguished stranger eclipsed the caballeros for 
the moment; nor a whispered word that he retained the friendship she had offered him on the 
day of their meeting. He had not, indeed, had a 
word with her alone. But his interest and admiration had deepened. It was evident that her 
father and the Governor adored her, would deny 
her little. Her attitude to them was alternately 
that of the petted child and the chosen companion. 
As her mother was indisposed she occupied her 
place at the table, presiding with dignity, guiding 
the conversation, revealing the rare gift of making everyone appear at his best. In the evening 
she had sometimes danced alone for a few moments, but more often with her Eussian guests, 
and readily learning the English country-dances 




they were anxious to teach. Eezanov would have 
found the gay informality of these evenings delightful had his mind been at ease about his Sitkans, and Concha a trifle more personal. He had 
begun by suspecting that she was manoeuvring 
for his scalp, but he was forced to acquit her ; for 
not only did she show no provocative favor to 
another, but she seemed to have gained in dignity 
and pride since his arrival, actually to have kissed 
her hand in farewell to the childhood he had been 
so slow in divining; grown — he felt rather than 
analyzed — above the pettiness of coquetry. Once 
more she had stirred the dormant ideals of his 
early manhood; there were moments when she 
floated before his inner vision as the embodiment 
of the world's beauty. Nor ever had there been 
a woman born more elaborately equipped for the 
position of a public man's mate; nor more ingenerate, perhaps, with the power to turn earth 
into heaven. 

He had wondered humorously if he were fallen 
in love, but although he retained little faith in 
the activities of the heart after youth, he was beginning seriously to consider the expedience of 
marrying Concha Argiiello. He had not intended 
to marry again, and it was this old and passionate 




love of personal freedom that alone iield him 
back, for nothing would be so advantageous to the 
Kussian colonies in their present crisis as a strong 
individual alliance with California. Concha Argiiello was the famous daughter of its first subject, 
and with the powerful friends she would bring to 
her husband, the consummation of ends dearer to 
his heart than aught on earth would be a matter of 
months instead of years. And he thrilled with 
pride as he thought of Concha in St. Petersburg. 
Two years of court life and she would be one of the 
greatest ladies in Europe. That he could win her 
he believed, and without undue vanity. He had 
much to offer an ambitious clever girl conscious 
of her superiority to the men of this province of 
Spain, and chafing at the prospect of a lifetime in 
a bountiful desert. His only hesitation lay in his 
own doubt if she were worth the loss of his freedom, and all that word involved to a man of his 
position and adventurous spirit. 

He shrugged his shoulders at this argument; 
he had walked off some of his ill-humor, and reverted willingly to a theme that alone had given 
him satisfaction during the past few days. 
At the same time he made a motion as if flinging 
aside an old burden. 





It is time for such nonsense to end," he 
thought contemptuously. " And in truth these 
three years have wrought such changes in me I 
doubt I should have patience for an hour of the 
old trifling. My greatest need from this time on, 
I fancy, is work. I could never be idle a month 
again. And when a man is in love with work — 
and power — and has passed forty — does he want 
a constant companion! That is the point. At my 
time of life power exercises the most irresistible 
and lasting of all fascinations. A man that wins 
it has little left for a woman." 

He had reached the summit of the rocky out- 
post, the highest of the hills where the peninsula 
turned abruptly to the south, and, scrupulously 
refraining from a downward glance at the Battery 
of Yerba Buena, stood looking out over the bay 
to the eastern mountains : dark, almost formless, 
wrapped in the intense and menacing mystery of 
that last hour before dawn. 

" Seiior ! " called a low cautious voice. 

Eezanov stepped hastily back from the point 
of the bluff and glanced about in wonder, his 
pulses suddenly astir. But he could see no one. 

"Senor! " 

This time the direction was unmistakable, and 




he went to the edge of the plateau facing the south 
and looked over. Half-way down a shallow and 
almost perpendicular gully, he saw a girl 
forcing a mustang up the harsh loose path. The 
girl's white and oval face looked from the 
folds of a black reboso like the moon emerging 
from clouds, and its young beauty was out of 
place in that wild and forbidding setting. She 
reined in her horse as she caught his eye and 
beckoned superfluously; then guided her mustang 
to a little ledge where he could plant his feet 
firmly, permitting her to reassume her usual 
pride of carriage and averting the danger of a 
sudden scramble or need of assistance. 

As Eezanov reached her side she gave him a 
grave and friendly smile, but no opportunity to 
kiss her hand. 

" I have followed your excellency,'' she said. 
" I saw you leave the Juno and as I am often 
up at this hour, and as no one else ever is, my 
father ignores the fact that I sometimes ride 
alone. I have never come as far as this before, 
but there is something I wish to say to you, and 
there is no opportunity at home. I asked Santiago to find me one last night, but he was in a bad 
temper and would not. Men! However — I suppose you have heard nothing of the cargo ? ' ' 



 

" I have not, ' ' said Rezanov grimly, although 
acutely sensible that the subject suited neither 
his mood nor the hour. 

" But the Governor has ! Madre de Dios ! all 
the women of the Presidio and the Mission have 
pestered him. They are sick with jealousy at the 
shawls you gave us that day — those that did not 
go to the ship. How clever of your excellency to 
give us just enough for ourselves and nothing for 
our friends ! And those that went want more and 
more. They have called upon him — one, two, 
four, and alone. They have wept and scolded and 
pleaded. I did not know until yesterday that your 
commissary had also shown the things to the 
priests from San Jose — Father Jose Uria and 
Father Pedro de la Cueva. They and the priests 
of San Francisco have argued with the Governor 
not once but three times. Dios ! how his poor excellency swore yesterday. He threatened to return at once to Monterey. I flew into a great rage 
and threatened in turn to follow with all the other 
girls and all the priests, vowed he should not have 
one moment of peace until that cargo was ours." 

" Well! '' asked Rezanov sharply, in spite of 
his amusement. 

Concha shook her head. '' When he does not 




swear he answers only: ' Buy if yon have the 
money. I have never broken a law of Spain and 
I shall not begin in my old age.' He knows well 
that we have no money to send out of New Spain ; 
but I have conceived a plan, senor. It is for 
you, not for me, to suggest it. You will never 
betray that I have been your friend, Excellency ? ' ' 

" I will swear it if you wish," said Eezanov 
frigidly. 

"" Pardon, senor. If I thought you could I 
should not be here. One often says such things. 
This is the plan: You shall suggest that we buy 
your wares, and that you buy again with our 
money. The dear Governor only wants to save 
his conscience an ache, for we have driven him 
nearly distracted. I am sure he will consent, for 
you will know how to put it to him very diplomatically. ' ' 

" But if he refused to understand, or his con- 
science remained obdurate? I should then have 
neither cargo nor ballast.'' 

'' He would never trick a guest, nor would ho 
let the money go out of the country. And he 
knows well how much we need your cargo and 
longs to be able to state in his reports that he 
sold you a hold full of breadstuffs. Moreover, I 




think the time has come to tell him of the dis- 
tress at Sitka. He is very soft-hearted and is 
now in that distracted state of mind where only 
one more argument is required. I hope I have 
given you good advice, Excellency. It is the best 
I can think of. I have given it much thought, and 
the terrible state of those miserable creatures has 
kept me awake many nights. I must return now. 
Will your excellency kindly remain here until I 
am well on my way! — and then return by the 
beach? I shall go as I came, through the valley. 
Neither of us can be seen from the Battery. ' ' 

" I will obey all your instructions," said Eezanov. But he did not move, nor could the mustang. Concha smiled and pointed to the other 
side of the cleft, which was about as wide as a 
narrow street. 

" Pardon, senor, I cannot turn.'' 

For a moment Eezanov stared at her, through 
her. Then his heavy eyes opened and flashed. It 
seemed to him that for the first time he saw how 
beautiful, how desirable she was, set in that gray 
volcanic rock with the heavens gray above her 
and the stars fading out. It was not the bower 
he would have imagined for the wooing of a 
mate, but neither moonlight nor the romantic 




glades of La Bellissima could have awakened in 
him a passion so sudden and final. Her face between the black folds turned whiter and she 
shrank back against the jagged wall; and when 
his eyes flashed again with a wild eager hope she 
involuntarily crossed herself. He threw himself 
against the horse and snatched her down and 
kissed her as he had kissed no woman yet, recognizing her once for all. 

When he finally held her at arm's length for a 
moment he laughed confusedly. 

" The Eussian bear is no longer a figure of 
speech,' he said. " Forgive me. I forgot that 
you are as tender as you are strong.'' 

Her hands were tightly clasped against her 
breast, and the breath was short in her throat, 
but she made no protest. Her eyes were radiant, 
her mouth was the only color in that gray dawn. 
In a moment she too laughed. 

" Dios de mi alma! What will they say? A 
heretic! If Tamalpais fell into the sea it would 
not make so great a sensation in this California 
of ours where civilized man exists but to drive 
heathen souls into the one true church." 

" Will it matter to you! Are you strong 
enough? It will be only a question of time to win 
them over, if you are." 



 

She nodded emphatically. " I was born with 
strength. Now — Dios! — now I can be stronger 
than the King of Spain himself, than the Governor, my parents and all the priests — You would 
not become a Catholic! " she asked abruptly. 

He shook his head, although he still smiled at 
her. " Not even for you. ' ' 

" No," she said thoughtfully. " I will confess 
— what matters it! — I often dreamed that this 
would come just because I believed it would not. 
But why should one control the imagination when 
it alone can give us happiness for a little while! 
I gave it reign, for I thought that one-half of all 
my life was to be passed in that unreal but by no 
means niggardly world. And I thought of everything. To change your religion would mean the 
ruin of your career; moreover, it is not a possibility of your character. Were it I think I 
should not love you so much. Nor could I 
bear to think of any change in you. Only it will 
be harder — longer.'' Then she stretched out her 
hand, and closed and opened it slowly. The most 
obtuse could not have failed to read the old simile 
of the steel in the velvet. " I shall win because 
it is my nature — and my power— to hold what I 
grasp. ' ' 



 

" But if tliey persistently refuse- 



" Dios ! " she interrupted him. " Do you think 
that your love is greater than mine? I was born 
with a thousand years of love in me and had 
you not come I should have gone alone with my 
dreams to the grave. I am all women in one, 
not merely Concha Argiiello, a girl of sixteen." 
She clasped her hands high above her head, lifting her eyes to the ashen vault so soon to yield 
to the gay brush of dawn. 

" Before all that great mystery, " she said 
solemnly, " I give myself to you forever, how 
much or how little that may mean here on earth. 
Forever.'' 



iXVI 

The Comandante of the San Francisco Company sat opposite Kezanov with his mouth open, 
the lines of his strong face elongated and relaxed. 
It was the hour of siesta, and they were alone in 
the sala. 

" Mother of God! " he exclaimed. " Mother 
of God! Are you mad, Excellency? " 

" No man was ever saner, " said Rezanov cheerfully. " What better proof would you have than 
this final testimony to Doha Concha's perfections? '' 

" But it cannot be! Surely, Excellency, you 
realize that ! The priests ! Ay yi ! Ay yi ! ' ' 

" I think I understand the priests. Persuade 
the Governor to buy my cargo and they will look 
upon me as an amicus humasii generis to whom 
common rules do not apply. And I have won 
their sincere friendship.'' 

'' You have won mine, sehor. But, though I 
say it, there is no more devout Catholic in the 
Californias than Jose Argiiello. Do you know 
what they call me? El santo. God knows I am 




not, but it is not for want of the wish. Did I 
give my daughter to a heretic, not only should I 
become an outcast, a pariah, but I should imperil 
my everlasting soul and that of my best beloved 
child. It is impossible. Excellency— unless, indeed, you embrace our faith. ' ' 

" That is so impossible that the subject is not 
worth the waste of a moment. But surely, Comandante, in your excitement at this perfectly 
natural issue you are misrepresenting yourself. 
I do not believe, devout Catholic as you are, that 
your soul is steeped in fanaticism. You are known 
far and wide as the first and most intelligent of 
his Catholic Majesty's subjects in New Spain. 
When you have my word of honor that your 
daughter 's faith shall never be disturbed, it is impossible you should believe that marriage with 
me would ruin her chances of happiness in the 
next world. But I doubt if your soul and conscience will have the peace you desire if you ruin 
her happiness in this. What pleasure do you find 
in the thought of an old age companioned by a 
heart-broken daughter? '' 

Don Jose turned pale and hitched his chair. 
" Other maids have been balked when young, and 
have forgotten. Concha is but sixteen " 




" She is also unique. She will marry me or 
no one. Of that I am as certain as that she is the 
woman of women for me. ' ' 

'' How can you be so certain! " asked the Comandante sharply. " Surely you have had little 
talk alone with her? '' 

'"' The heart has a language of its own. Eecall 
your own youth, sehor." 

" It is true," said Don Jose with a heavy sigh, 
as he had a fleeting vision of Dona Ignacia, slim 
and lovely at the grating, with a rose in her hair. 
" But this tremendous passion of the heart— it 
passes, seiior, it passes. We love the good wife, 
but we sometimes realize that we could have loved 
another good wife as well." 

'' That is a bit of philosophy I should have 
uttered myself, Comandante — yesterday. But 
there are women and women, and your daughter 
is one of the chosen few who take from the years 
what the years take from others. I am not rushing 
into matrimony for the sake of a pair of black 
eyes and a fine figure. I have outlived the possibility of making a fool of myself if I would. Be- 
fore I realized how deeply I loved your daughter 
I had deliberately chosen her out of all the women 
I have known, as my friend and companion for 



 

the various and difficult ways of life which I shall 
be called upon to follow. Your daughter will have 
a high place at the Kussian Court, and she will 
occupy it as naturally as had I found her in 
Madrid and you in the great position to which 
your attainments and services entitle you." 

Don Jose, despite his consternation, titillated 
agreeably. He privately thought no one in New 
Spain good enough for his daughter, and his 
weather-beaten self was not yet insensible to the 
rare visitation of winged darts tipped with honey. 
But the situation was one of the most embarrassing he had ever been called upon to face, and perhaps for the first time in his direct and honest 
life his resolution was shaken in a crisis. 

" Believe me, your excellency, I appreciate the 
honor you have done my house, and I will add 
with all my heart that never have I liked any man 
more. But-Mother of God! Mother of God! " 

Rezanov took out his cigarette case, a superb 
bit of Eussian enamel, graven with the Imperial 
arms, and a parting gift from Alexander. He 
passed it to his host, who had developed a prefer- 
ence for Russian cigarettes. 

( i There are other things to consider besides the 
happiness of your daughter and myself," he remarked. " This alliance would mean the con- 
solidation of Spanish and Russian interests on the 
Pacific coast. It would mean the protection of 
California in the almost certain event of American ' aggression. And I hear that a courier 
brought word again yesterday that the Russian 
and the Spanish fleets had sailed for these waters. 
I do not believe a word of it ; but should it be true, 
I would remind you of two things : that I have the 
powers of the Tsar himself in this part of the 
world, and that the Russian fleet is likely to arrive 
first. " 

Again the Comandante moved uneasily. The 
news from Mexico had kept himself and the Governor awake the better part of the night. He 
fully appreciated the importance of this powerful 
Russian's friendship. Nothing would bind and 
commit him like taking a Calif ornian to wife. If 
only he had fallen in love with Carolina Ximeno or 
Delfina Rivera! Don Jose had an uneasy suspicion that his scruples as a Catholic might have 
gone down l)efore his sense of duty to this poor 
California. But a heretic in his own family! He 
was justly renowned for his piety. Aside from 
the wrath of the church, the mere thought of one 
of his offspring in matrimonial community be- 




yond its pale made him sick witli repugnance. 
And yet— California! And he would have selected 
Eezanov for his daughter out of all men had he 
been of their faith. And he was deeply conscious 
of the honor that had descended, however unfruitfully, upon his house. Madre de Dios ! How 
would it end? Suddenly he felt himself inspired. 
In blissful ignorance of her subtle feminine rule, 
he reminded himself that Concha's mind was the 
child of his own. When she saw his embarrassment, filial duty and woman's wit would extricate 
them both with grace and avert the enmity of the 
Russian even though the latter 's more personal 
interest in California must die in his disappointment. He would make her feel the weight of the 
stern paternal hand, and then indicate the part 
she had to play. 

He rang a bell and directed the servant to sum- 
mon his daughter, drew himself up to his full 
height and set his rugged face in hard lines. As 
Concha entered he looked the Comandante, the 
stern disciplinarian, every inch of him. 

There was no trace of the siesta in Concha's 
cheeks. They were very white, but her eyes were 
steady and her mouth indomitable as she walked 
down the sala and took the chair Eezanov placed 



 

for her. Except for her Castilian fairness, she 
looked very like the martinet sitting on the other 
side of the table. The Comandante regarded her 
silently with brows drawn together. Dimly, he 
felt apprehension, wondered, in a flash of insight, 
if girls held fast to the parental recipe, or recombined with tongue in the cheek. The bare possi- 
bility of resistance almost threw him into panic, 
but he controlled his features until the effort injected his eyes and drew in his nostrils. Concha 
regarded him calmly, although her heart beat 
unevenly, for she dreaded the long strain she foresaw. 

" My daughter,'' said Don Jose finally, his 
tones harsh with repressed misgiving, " do you 
suspect why I have sent for you I " 

" I think that his excellency wishes to marry 
me," replied Concha; and the Comandante was 
so staggered by the calm assurance of her tone 
and manner that his pent-up emotion exploded. 

'' Dios! " he roared. " What right have you 
to know when a man wishes to marry you? What 
manner of Spanish girl is this? Truly has his 
excellency said that you are not as other women. 
The place for you is your room, with bread and 
water for a week. Sixteen! " 



 

" Ignacio was born when my mother was six- 
teen," said Concha coolly. 

" What of that! She married whom and when 
she was told to marry.' 

" I have heard that you serenaded nightly beneath her grating " 

'' So did others." 

" I have heard that when of all her suitors her 
father chose one more highly bom, a gentleman 
of the Viceroy's court, she pined until they gave 
their consent to her marriage with you, lest she 
die." 

" But I was a Catholic ! The prejudice against 
my birth was an unworthy one. I had distinguished myself. And she had the support of the 
priests." 

" It is my misfortune that M. de Rezanov is not 
a Catholic, but it will make no difference. I shall 
not fall ill, for I am like you, not like my dear 
mother— and the education you have given me is 
very different from hers. But I shall marry his 
excellency or no one, and whether I marry him 
or live alone with the thought of him until the 
end of my mortal days, I do not believe tliat my 
soul will be imperilled in the least." 

" You do not! " shouted the irate Spaniard. 



 

" How dare you presume to decide sucli a question for yourself? WKat does a woman know of 
love until she marries! It is nothing but a sickening of the imagination before; and if the man 
goes, the doctor soon comes. " 

" You may not have intended— but you have 
taught me to think for myself. And I have seen 
others besides M. de Rezanov— the flower of California and more than one fine gentleman from 
Mexico. I will have none of them. I will marry 
the man of my choice or no one. It may be that 
I know naught of love. If you wish you may 
think that my choice of a husband is determined 
by ambition, that I am dazzled with the thought 
of court life in St. Petersburg, of being the consort of a great and wealthy noble. It matters, 
not. Love or ambition, I shall marry this Russian 
or I shall never marry at all. ' ' 

'' Mother of God! Mother of God! '' Don 
Jose's face was purple. The veins swelled in his 
neck. He was the more wroth because he recognized his own daughter and his own handiwork, 
because he saw that he confronted a Toledo 
blade, not a woman's brittle will, such as he had 
grown old in knowledge of. Concha regarded him 
calmly.
