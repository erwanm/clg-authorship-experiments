' Oh, you ! ' murmured Madame Grandoni. 

' If you think so poorly of me why did you say just now 
that you were glad to see me?' Sholto demanded, in a 
moment. 

'Because you make another person in the house, and 
that is more regular; the situation is by so much less 
what did you call it ? eccentric. Nun? the old lady went 
on, in a moment, ' so long as you are here I won't go off.' 

' Depend upon it that I shall be here until I'm turned 
out.' 

She rested her small, troubled eyes upon him, but they 
betrayed no particular enthusiasm at this announcement. 
' I don't understand how, for yourself, on such an occasion, 
you should like it.' 

'Dear Madame Grandoni, the heart of man, without 
being such a hopeless labyrinth as the heart of woman, is 
still sufficiently complicated. Don't I know what will 
become of the little beggar ? ' 

'You are very horrible,' said the ancient woman. Then 
she added, in a different tone, ' He is much too good for 
his fate.' 

' And pray wasn't I, for mine ? ' the Captain asked. 

' By no manner of means ! ' Madame Grandoni answered, 
rising and moving away from him. 




The Princess had come into the room, accompanied by 
Hyacinth. As it was now considerably past the dinner- 
hour the old lady judged that this couple, on their side, 
had met in the hall and had prolonged their conversation 
there. Hyacinth watched with extreme interest the way 
the Princess greeted the Captain observed that it was 
very simple, easy and friendly. At dinner she made no 
stranger of him, including him in everything, as if he had 
been a useful familiar, like Madame Grandoni, only a little 
less venerable, yet not giving him any attention that might 
cause their eyes to meet. She had told Hyacinth that she 
didn't like his eyes, nor indeed, very much, any part of him. 
Of course any admiration, from almost any source, could 
not fail to be in some degree agreeable to a woman, but of 
any little impression that one might ever have produced the 
mark she had made on Godfrey Sholto was the one that 
ministered least to her vanity. He had been useful, un- 
doubtedly, at times, but at others he had been an intoler- 
able bore. He was so uninteresting in himself, so shallow, 
so unoccupied and superfluous, and really so frivolous, in 
spite of his pretension (of which she was unspeakably 
weary) of being all wrapped up in a single idea. It had 
never, by itself, been sufficient to interest her in any man, 
the fact that he was in love with her ; but indeed she could 
honestly say that most of the people who had liked her had 
had, on their own side, something something in their 
character or circumstances that one could care a little 
about. Not so far as would do any harm, save perhaps in 
one or two cases ; but still, something. 

Sholto was a curious and not particularly edifying English 
type (as the Princess further described him) ; one of those 



 

strange beings produced by old societies that have run to seed, 
corrupt, exhausted civilisations. He was a cumberer of the 
earth, and purely selfish, in spite of his devoted, disinterested 
airs. He was nothing whatever in himself, and had no 
character or merit save by tradition, reflection, imitation, 
superstition. He had a longish pedigree he came of some 
musty, mouldy ' county family,' people with a local reputa- 
tion and an immense lack of general importance ; he had 
taken the greatest care of his little fortune. He had 
travelled all over the globe several times, ' for the shooting,' 
in that brutal way of the English. That was a pursuit which 
was compatible with the greatest stupidity. He had a little 
taste, a little cleverness, a little reading, a little good furni- 
ture, a little French and Italian (he exaggerated these latter 
quantities), an immense deal of assurance, and complete 
leisure. That, at bottom, was all he represented idle, 
trifling, luxurious, yet at the same time pretentious leisure, 
the sort of thing that led people to invent false, humbugging 
duties, because they had no real ones. Sholto's great idea 
of himself (after his profession of being her slave), was 
that he was a cosmopolite exempt from every prejudice. 
About the prejudices the Princess couldn't say and didn't 
care ; but she had seen him in foreign countries, she had 
seen him in Italy, and she was bound to say he understood 
nothing about those people. It was several years before, 
shortly after her marriage, that she had first encountered 
him. He had not begun immediately to take the adoring 
line, but it had come little by little. It was only after she 
had separated from her husband that he had begun really 
to hang about her ; since when she had suffered much from 
him. She would do him one justice, however : he had 





never, so far as she knew, had the impudence to represent 
himself as anything but hopeless and helpless. It was on 
this that he took his stand ; he wished to pass for the great 
model of unrewarded constancy. She couldn't imagine 
what he was waiting for ; perhaps it was for the death of 
the Prince. But the Prince would never die, nor had she 
the least desire that he should. She had no wish to be 
harsh, for of course that sort of thing, from any one, was 
very .flattering; but really, whatever feeling poor Sholto 
might have, four-fifths of it were purely theatrical. He was 
not in the least a natural human being, but had a hundred 
affectations and attitudes, the result of never having been 
obliged to put his hand to anything ; having no serious 
tastes and yet being born to a little 'position.' The Prin- 
cess remarked that she was so glad Hyacinth had no posi- 
tion, had been forced to do something else in life but amuse 
himself; that was the way she liked her friends now. She 
had said to Sholto again and again, ' There are plenty of 
others who will be much more pleased; why not go to 
them? It's such a waste of time:' and she was sure he 
had taken her advice, and was by no means, as regards 
herself, the absorbed, annihilated creature  he endeavoured 
to appear. He had told her once that he tried to take an 
interest in other women though indeed he had added that 
it was of no use. Of what use did he expect anything he 
could possibly do to be ? Hyacinth did not tell the Prin- 
cess that he had reason to believe the Captain's effort in 
this direction had not been absolutely vain ; but he made 
that reflection, privately, with increased confidence. He 
recognised a further truth even when his companion said, 
at the end, that, with all she had touched upon, he was a 



 

queer combination. Trifler as he was, there was something 
sinister in him too ; and she confessed she had had a vague 
feeling, at times, that some day he might do her a hurt. 
Hyacinth, at this, stopped short, on the threshold of the 
drawing-room, and asked in a low voice, ' Are you afraid of 
him?' 

The Princess looked at him a moment ; then smiling, 
' Dio mio, how you say that ! Should you like to kill him 
for me ? ' 

c I shall have to kill some one, you know. Why not 
him, while I'm about it, if he troubles you ? ' 

'Ah, my friend, if you should begin to kill every one 
who had troubled me ! ' the Princess murmured, as they 
went into the room. 



XXVII 

HYACINTH knew there was something out of the way as 
soon as he saw Lady Aurora's face look forth at him, in 
answer to his tap, while she held the door ajar. What was 
she doing in Pinnie's bedroom ? a very poor place, into 
which the dressmaker, with her reverence, would never have 
admitted a person of that quality unless things were pretty 
bad. She was solemn, too ; she didn't laugh, as usual ; 
she had removed her large hat, with its limp, old-fashioned 
veil, and she raised her ringer to her lips. Hyacinth's first 
alarm had been immediately after he let himself into the 
house, with his latch-key, as he always did, and found the 
little room on the right of the passage, in which Pinnie had 
lived ever since he remembered, fireless and untenanted. 
As soon as he had paid the cabman, who put down his 
portmanteau for him in the hall (he was not used to paying 
cabmen, and was conscious he gave him too much, but was 
too impatient, in his sudden anxiety, to care), he hurried 
up the vile staircase, which seemed viler, even through his 
preoccupation, than ever, and gave the knock, accompanied 
by a call the least bit tremulous, immediately answered by 
Lady Aurora. She drew back into the room a moment, 
while he stared, in his dismay; then she emerged again, 
closing the door behind her all with the air of enjoining 



 

him to be terribly quiet. He felt, suddenly, so sick at the 
idea of having lingered at Medley while there was distress 
in the wretched little house to which he owed so much, that 
he scarcely found strength for an articulate question, and 
obeyed, mechanically, the mute, urgent gesture by which 
Lady Aurora appealed to him to go downstairs with her. 
It was only when they stood together in the deserted 
parlour (it was as if he perceived for the first time what an 
inelegant odour prevailed there), that he asked, 'Is she 
dying is she dead?' That was the least the strained 
sadness looking out from the face of the noble visitor 
appeared to announce. 

' Dear Mr. Robinson, I'm so sorry for you. I wanted 
to write, but I promised her I wouldn't. She is very ill 
we are very anxious. It began ten days ago, and I sup- 
pose I must tell you how much she has gone down.' 
Lady Aurora spoke with more than all her usual embar- 
rassments and precautions, eagerly, yet as if it cost her 
much pain : pausing a little after everything she said, 
to see how he would take it; then going on, with a 
propitiatory rush. He learned presently what was the 
matter, what doctor she had sent for, and that if he 
would wait a little before going into the room it would 
be so much better ; the invalid having sunk, within half 
an hour, into a doze of a less agitated kind than she 
had had for some time, from which it would be an im- 
mense pity to run the risk of waking her. The doctor 
gave her the right things, as it seemed to her ladyship, 
but he admitted that she had very little power of resistance. 
He was of course not a very large practitioner, Mr. Buf- 
fery, from round the corner, but he seemed really clever ; 





and she herself had taken the liberty (as she confessed 
to this she threw off one of her odd laughs, and her colour 
rose), of sending an elderly, respectable person a kind of 
nurse. She was out just then; she had to go, for an 
hour, for the air 'only when I come, of course,' said 
Lady Aurora. Dear Miss Pynsent had had a cold hang- 
ing about her, and had not taken care of it. Hyacinth 
would know how plucky she was about that sort of 
thing ; she took so little interest in herself. ' Of course 
a cold is a cold, whoever has it; isn't it?' said Lady 
Aurora. Ten days before, she had taken an additional 
chill through falling asleep in her chair, in the evening, 
down there, and letting the fire go out. ' It would have 
been nothing if she had been like you or me, you know,' 
her ladyship went on ; . ' but just as she was then, 
it made the difference. The day was horribly damp, 
and it had struck into the lungs, and inflammation 
had set in. Mr. Buffery says she was impoverished, 
just rather low and languid, you know.' The next morn- 
ing she had bad pains and a good deal of fever, yet 
she had got up. Poor Pinnie's gracious ministrant did 
not make clear to Hyacinth what time had elapsed 
before she came to her relief, nor by what means she 
had been notified, and he saw that she slurred this over 
from the admirable motive of wishing him not to feel 
that the little dressmaker had suffered by his absence or 
called for him in vain. This, apparently, had indeed not 
been the case, if Pinnie had opposed, successfully, his 
being written to. Lady Aurora only said, ' I came in 
very soon, it was such a delightful chance. Since then 
she has had everything ; only it's sad to see a person 



 

need so little. She did want you to stay ; she has clung 
to that idea. I speak the simple truth, Mr. Robinson.' 

' I don't know what to say to you you are so extra- 
ordinarily good, so angelic,' Hyacinth replied, bewildered 
and made weak by a strange, unexpected shame. The 
episode he had just traversed, the splendour he had been 
living in and drinking so deep of, the unnatural alliance to 
which he had given himself up while his wretched little 
foster-mother struggled alone with her death-stroke he 
could see it was that ; the presentiment of it, the last 
stiff horror, was in all the place the contrast seemed to 
cut him like a knife, and to make the horrible accident of 
his absence a perversity of his own. ' I can never blame 
you, when you are so kind, but I wish to God I had 
known ! ' he broke out. 

Lady Aurora clasped her hands, begging him to judge 
her fairly. ' Of course it was a great responsibility for us, 
but we thought it right to consider what she urged upon 
us. She went back to it constantly, that your visit should 
not be cut short. When you should come of yourself, it 
would be time enough. I don't know exactly where you 
have been, but she said it was such a pleasant house. She 
kept repeating that it would do you so much good.' 

Hyacinth felt his eyes filling with tears. ' She's dying 
she's dying ! How can she live when she's like that ? ' 

He sank upon the old yellow sofa, the sofa of his 
lifetime and of so many years before, and buried his head 
on the shabby, tattered arm. A succession of sobs broke 
from his lips sobs in which the accumulated emotion 
of months and the strange, acute conflict of feeling that 
had possessed him for the three weeks just past found relief 





and a kind of solution. Lady Aurora sat down beside him 
and laid her finger-tips gently on his hand. So, for a 
minute, while his tears flowed and she said nothing, he felt 
her timid, consoling touch. At the end of the minute he 
raised his head; it came back to him that she had said 
' we ' just before, and he asked her whom she meant. 

' Oh, Mr. /Vetch, don't you know ? I have made his 
acquaintance ; it's impossible to be more kind.' Then, 
while, for an instant, Hyacinth was silent, wincing, pricked 
with the thought that Pinnie had been beholden to the 
fiddler while he was masquerading in high life, Lady Aurora 
added, ' He's a charming musician. She asked him once, 
at first, to bring his violin ; she thought it would soothe 
her.' 

' I'm much obliged to him, but now that I'm here we 
needn't trouble him,' said Hyacinth. 

Apparently there was a certain dryness in his tone, 
which was the cause of her ladyship's venturing to reply, 
after an hesitation, ' Do let him come, Mr. Robinson ; let 
him be near you ! I wonder whether you know that 
that he has a great affection for you.' 

' The more fool he ; I have always treated him like a 
brute ! ' Hyacinth exclaimed, colouring. 

The way Lady Aurora spoke proved to him, later, that 
she now definitely did know his secret, or one of them, 
rather ; for at the rate things had been going for the last 
few months he was making a regular collection. She knew 
the smaller not, of course, the greater ; she had, decidedly, 
been illuminated by Pinnie's divagations. At the moment 
he made that reflection, however, he was almost startled to 
perceive how completely he had ceased to resent such be- 



 

trayals and how little it suddenly seemed to signify that 
the innocent source of them was about to be quenched. 
The sense of his larger secret swallowed up that particular 
anxiety, making him ask himself what it mattered, for the 
time that was left to him, that people should whisper to 
each other his little mystery. The day came quickly when 
he believed, and yet didn't care, that it had been univer- 
sally imparted. 

After Lady Aurora left him, promising she would call 
him the first moment it should seem prudent, he walked up 
and down the cold, stale parlour, immersed in his medita- 
tions. The shock of the danger of losing Pinnie had 
already passed away ; he had achieved so much, of late, in 
the line of accepting the idea of death that the little dress- 
maker, in taking her departure, seemed already to benefit 
by this curious discipline. What was most vivid to him, in 
the deserted scene of Pinnie's unsuccessful industry, was the 
changed vision with which he had come back to objects 
familiar for twenty years. The picture was the same, and 
all its horrid elements, wearing a kind of greasy gloss in the 
impure air of Lomax Place, made, through the mean win- 
dow-panes, a dismal chiaroscitro showed, in their polished 
misery, the friction of his own little life; but the eyes with 
which he looked at it had new terms of comparison. He 
had known the place was hideous and sordid, but its aspect 
to-day was pitiful to the verge of the sickening; he couldn't 
believe that for years together he had accepted and even, a 
little, revered it. He was frightened at the sort of service 
that his experience of grandeur had rendered him. It was 
all very well to have assimilated that element with a rapidity 
which had surprises even for himself; but with sensibilities 


now so improved what fresh arrangement could one come 
to with the very humble, which was in its nature uncompro- 
mising? Though the spring was far advanced the day was 
a dark drizzle, and the room had the clamminess of a 
finished use, an ooze of dampness from the muddy street, 
where the areas were a narrow slit. No wonder Pinnie had 
felt it at last, and her small under-fed organism had grown 
numb and ceased to act. At the thought of her limited, 
stinted life, the patient, humdrum effort of her needle and 
scissors, which had ended only in a show-room where 
there was nothing to show and a pensive reference to the 
cut of sleeves no longer worn, the tears again rose to 
his eyes ; but he brushed them aside when he heard a 
cautious tinkle at the house-door, which was presently 
opened by the little besmirched slavey retained for the 
service of the solitary lodger a domestic easily bewil- 
dered, who had a squint and distressed Hyacinth by 
wearing shoes that didn't match, though they were of an 
equal antiquity and resembled each other in the facility 
with which they dropped off. Hyacinth had not heard Mr. 
Vetch's voice in the hall, apparently because he spoke in 
a whisper ; but the young man was not surprised when, 
taking every precaution not to make the door creak, he 
came into the parlour. The fiddler said nothing to him 
at first; the two men only looked at each other for a 
long minute. Hyacinth saw what he most wanted to 
know whether he knew the worst about Pinnie ; but what 
was further in his eyes (they had an expression considerably 
different from any he had hitherto seen in them), defined 
itself to our hero only little by little. 

' Don't you think you might have written me a word ? ' 



 

said Hyacinth, at last. His anger at having been left in 
ignorance had quitted him, but he thought the question 
fair. None the less, he expected a sarcastic answer, and 
was surprised at the mild reasonableness with which Mr. 
Vetch replied 

' I assure you, no responsibility, in the course of my 
life, ever did more to distress me. There were obvious 
reasons for calling you back, and yet I couldn't help wish- 
ing you might finish your visit. I balanced one thing 
against the other ; it was very difficult.' 

' I can imagine nothing more simple. When people's 
nearest and dearest are dying, they are usually sent 
for.' 

The fiddler gave a strange, argumentative smile. If 
Lomax Place and Miss Pynsent's select lodging-house wore 
a new face of vulgarity to Hyacinth, it may be imagined 
whether the renunciation of the niceties of the toilet, the 
resigned seediness, which marked Mr. Vetch's old age was 
unlikely to lend itself to comparison. The glossy butler at 
Medley had had a hundred more of the signs of success 
in life. ' My dear boy, this case was exceptional,' said 
the old man. ' Your visit had a character of importance. ' 

' I don't know what you know about it. I don't remem- 
ber that I told you anything.' 

' No, certainly, you have never told me much. But if, 
as is probable, you have seen that kind lady who is now 
upstairs, you will have learned that Finnic made a tre- 
mendous point of your not being disturbed. She threat- 
ened us with her displeasure if we should hurry you back. 
You know what Pinnie's displeasure is ! ' As, at this, 
Hyacinth turned away with a gesture of irritation, Mr. 



Vetch went on, ' No doubt she is absurdly fanciful, poor 
dear thing ; but don't, now, cast any disrespect upon it. I 
assure you, if she had been here alone, suffering, sinking, 
without a creature to tend her, and nothing before her but 
to die in a corner, like a starved cat, she would still have 
faced that fate 'rather than cut short by a single hour your 
experience of novel scenes.' 

Hyacinth was silent for a moment. ' Of course I know 
what you mean. But she spun her delusion she always 
did, all of them out of nothing. I can't imagine what 
she knows about my " experience " of any kind of scenes. 
I told her, when I went out of town, very little more than 
I told you.' 

' What she guessed, what she gathered, has been, at any 
rate, enough. She has made up her mind that you have 
formed a connection by means of which you will come, 
somehow or other, into your own. She has done nothing 
but talk about your grand kindred. To her mind, you 
know, it's all one, the aristocracy, and nothing is simpler 
than that the person very exalted, as she believes with 
whom you have been to stay should undertake your busi- 
ness with her friends.' 

' Oh, well,' said Hyacinth, ' I'm very glad not to have 
deprived you of that entertainment.' 

' I assure you the spectacle was exquisite.' Then the 
fiddler added, ' My dear fellow, please leave her the idea.' 

' Leave it ? I'll do much more ! ' Hyacinth exclaimed. 
' I'll tell her my great relations have adopted me and that 
I have come back in the character of Lord Robinson.' 

' She will need nothing more to die happy,' Mr. Vetch 
observed. 



 

Five minutes later, after Hyacinth had obtained from 
his old friend a confirmation of Lady Aurora's account of 
Miss Pynsent's condition, Mr. Vetch explaining that he 
came over, like that, to see how she was, half a dozen times 
a day five minutes later a silence had descended upon 
the pair, while Hyacinth waited for some sign from Lady 
Aurora that he might come upstairs. The fiddler, who 
had lighted a pipe, looked out of the window, studying 
intently the physiognomy of Lomax Place ; and Hyacinth, 
making his tread discreet, walked about the room with his 
hands in his pockets. At last Mr. Vetch observed, with- 
out taking his pipe out of his lips or looking round, ' I 
think you might be a little more frank with me at this time 
of day and at such a crisis.' 

Hyacinth stopped in his walk, wondering for a moment, 
sincerely, what his companion meant, for he had no con- 
sciousness at present of an effort to conceal anything he 
could possibly tell (there were some things, of course, he 
couldn't) ; on the contrary, his life seemed to him par- 
ticularly open to the public view and exposed to invidious 
comment. It was at this moment he first observed a 
certain difference ; there was a tone in Mr. Vetch's voice 
that he had never perceived before an absence of that 
note which had made him say, in other days, that the im- 
penetrable old man was diverting himself at his expense. 
It was as if his attitude had changed, become more expli- 
citly considerate, in consequence of some alteration or 
promotion on Hyacinth's part, his having grown older, or 
more important, or even simply more surpassingly curious. 
If the first impression made upon him by Pinnie's old 
neighbour, as to whose place in the list of the sacrificial 



(his being a gentleman or one of the sovereign people) he 
formerly was so perplexed ; if the sentiment excited by Mr. 
Vetch in a mind familiar now for nearly a month with 
forms of indubitable gentility was not favourable to the 
idea of fraternisation, this secret impatience on Hyacinth's 
part was speedily corrected by one of the sudden reactions 
or quick conversions of which the young man was so often 
the victim. In the light of the fiddler's appeal, which evi- 
dently meant more than it said, his musty antiquity, his 
typical look  having had, for years, a small, definite use 
and taken all the creases and contractions of it, his visible 
expression, even, of ultimate parsimony and of having 
ceased to care for the shape of his trousers because he 
cared more for something else these things became so 
many reasons for turning round, going over to him, touch- 
ing signs of an invincible fidelity, the humble, continuous, 
single-minded practice of daily duties and an art after all 
very charming; pursued, moreover, while persons of the 
species our restored prodigal had lately been consorting 
with fidgeted from one selfish sensation to another and 
couldn't even live in the same place for three months 
together. 

' What should you like me to do, to say, to tell you ? 
Do you want to know what I have been doing in the 
country? I should have first to know, myself,' Hyacinth said. 

' Have you enjoyed it very much ? ' 

'Yes, certainly, very much not knowing anything 
about Pinnie. I have been in a beautiful house, with a 
beautiful woman.' 

Mr. Vetch had turned round ; he looked very impartial, 
through the smoke of his pipe. 



 

' Is she really a princess ? ' 

' I don't know what you mean by "really." I suppose 
all titles are great rot. But every one seems agreed to call 
her so.' 

' You know I have always liked to enter into your life ; 
and to-day the wish is stronger than ever,' the old man ob- 
served, presently, fixing his eyes very steadily on Hya- 
cinth's. 

The latter returned his gaze for a moment ; then he 
asked, ' What makes you say that just now ? ' 

The fiddler appeared to deliberate, and at last he replied, 
' Because you are in danger of losing the best friend you 
have ever had.' 

' Be sure I feel it. But if I have got you ' Hya- 
cinth added. 

' Oh, me ! I'm very old, and very tired of life.' 

' I suppose that that's what one arrives at. Well, if I 
can help you in any way you must lean on me, you must 
make use of me.' 

' That's precisely what I was going to say to you,' said 
Mr. Vetch. ' Should you like any money ? ' 

' Of course I should ! But why should you offer it to 
me?' 

' Because in saving it up, little by little, I have had you 
in mind.' 

' Dear Mr. Vetch,' said Hyacinth, ' you have me too 
much in mind. I'm not worth it, please believe that ; for 
all sorts of reasons. I should make money enough for any 
uses I have for it, or have any right to have, if I stayed 
quietly in London and attended to my work. As you 
know, I can earn a decent living.' 





'Yes, I can see that. But if you stayed quietly in 
London what would become of your princess ? ' 

' Oh, they can always manage, ladies in that position.' 

' Hanged if I understand her position ! ' cried Mr. 
Vetch, but without laughing. ' You have been for three 
weeks without work, and yet you look uncommonly smart.' 

' You see, my living has cost me nothing. When you 
stay with great people you don't pay your score,' Hyacinth 
explained, with great gentleness. 'Moreover, the lady 
whose hospitality I have been enjoying has made me a very 
handsome offer of work.' 
What kind of work ? ' 

' The only kind I know. She is going to send me a 
lot of books, to do up for her.' 

' And to pay you fancy prices ? ' 

' Oh, no I am to fix the prices myself.' 

' Are not transactions of that kind rather disagreeable, 
with a lady whose hospitality one has been enjoying ? ' 
Mr. Vetch inquired. 

' Exceedingly ! That is exactly why I shall do the 
books and then take no money.' 

' Your princess is rather clever ! ' the fiddler exclaimed, 
in a moment, smiling. 

'Well, she can't force me to take it if I won't,' said 
Hyacinth. 

' No ; you must only let me do that.' 

' You have curious ideas about me,' the young man 
declared. 

Mr. Vetch turned about to the window again, remarking 
that he had curious ideas about everything. Then he added, 
after an interval 



 

' And have you been making love to your great 
lady ? ' 

He had expected a flash of impatience in reply to this 
inquiry, and was rather surprised at the manner in which 
Hyacinth answered : ' How shall I explain ? It is not a 
question of that sort.' 

' Has she been making love to you, then ? ' 

' If you should ever see her you would understand how 
absurd that supposition is.' 

' How shall I ever see her ? ' returned Mr. Vetch. : In 
the absence of that privilege I think there is something in 
my idea.' 

' She looks quite over my head,' said Hyacinth, simply. 
' It's by no means impossible you may see her. She wants 
to know my friends, to know the people who live in the 
Place. And she would take a particular interest in you, 
on account of your opinions.' 

' Ah, I have no opinions now, none any more ! ' the 
old man broke out, sadly. ' I only had them to frighten 
Finnic.' 

' She was easily frightened,' said Hyacinth. 

' Yes, and easily reassured. Well, I like to know about 
your life,' his neighbour sighed, irrelevantly. ' But take 
care the great lady doesn't lead you too far.' 

' How do you mean, too far ? ' 

' Isn't she an anarchist a nihilist ? Doesn't she go in 
for a general rectification, as Eustace calls it ? ' 

Hyacinth was silent a moment. ' You should see the 
place you should see what she wears, what she eats and 
drinks.' 

' Ah, you mean that she is inconsistent with her theories ? 



My dear boy, she would be a droll woman if she were not. 
At any rate, I'm glad of it.' 

' Glad of it ? ' Hyacinth repeated. 

' For you," I mean, when you stay with her ; it's more 
luxurious ! ' Mr. Vetch exclaimed, turning round and smil- 
ing. At this moment a little rap on the floor above, given 
by Lady Aurora, announced that Hyacinth might at last 
come up and see Pinnie. Mr. Vetch listened and recog- 
nised it, and it led him to say, with considerable force, 
' Therms a woman whose theories and conduct do square !' 

Hyacinth, on the threshold, leaving the room, stopped 
long enough to reply, ' Well, when the day comes for my 
friend to give up you'll see.' 

' Yes, I have no doubt there are things she will bring 
herself to sacrifice,' the old man remarked ; but Hyacinth 
was already out of hearing. 



XXVIII 

MR. VETCH waited below till Lady Aurora should come 
down and give him the news he was in suspense for. His 
mind was pretty well made up about Pinnie. It had seemed 
to him, the night before, that death was written in her face, 
and he judged it on the whole a very good moment for her 
to lay down her earthly burden. He had reasons for 
believing that the future could not be sweet to her. As 
regards Hyacinth, his mind was far from being at ease ; for 
though he was aware in a general way that he had taken up 
with strange company, and though he had flattered himself 
of old that he should be pleased to see the boy act out his 
life and solve the problem of his queer inheritance, he was 
worried by the absence of full knowledge. He put out his 
pipe, in anticipation of Lady Aurora's reappearance, and 
without this consoler he was more accessible still to certain 
fears that had come to him in consequence of a recent talk, 
or rather an attempt at a talk, with Eustache Poupin. It 
was through the Frenchman that he had gathered the little 
he knew about the occasion of Hyacinth's unprecedented 
excursion. His ideas on the subject had been very infer- 
ential ; for Hyacinth had made a mystery of his absence to 
Pinnie, merely letting her know that there was a lady in the 
case and that the best luggage he could muster and the best 



way his shirts could be done up would still not be good 
enough. Poupin had seen Godfrey Sholto at the ' Sun and 
Moon,' and it had come to him, through Hyacinth, that 
there was a remarkable feminine influence in the Captain's 
life, mixed up in some way with his presence in Bloomsbury 
an influence, moreover, by which Hyacinth himself, for 
good or for evil, was in peril of being touched. Sholto was 
the young man's visible link with a society for which Lisson 
Grove could have no importance in the scheme of the 
universe but as a short cut (too disagreeable to be frequently 
used) out of Bayswater; therefore if Hyacinth left town 
with a new hat and a pair of kid gloves it must have been 
to move in the direction of that superior circle and in some 
degree, at least, at the solicitation of the before-mentioned 
feminine influence. So much as this the Frenchman sug- 
gested, explicitly enough, as his manner was, to the old 
fiddler ; but his talk had a flavour of other references which 
excited Mr. Vetch's curiosity much more than they satisfied 
it. They were obscure ; they evidently were painful to the 
speaker ; they were confused and embarrassed and totally 
wanting in the luminosity which usually characterised the 
lightest allusions of M. Poupin. It was the fiddler's fancy 
that his friend had something on his mind which he was not 
at liberty to impart, and that it related to Hyacinth and 
might, for those who took an interest in the singular lad, 
constitute a considerable anxiety. Mr. Vetch, on his own 
part, nursed this anxiety into a tolerably definite shape : he 
persuaded himself that the Frenchman had been leading 
the boy too far in the line of social criticism, had given him 
a push on some crooked path where a slip would be a likely 
accident. When on a subsequent occasion, with Poupin, 



 

he indulged in a hint of this suspicion, the bookbinder 
flushed a good deal and declared that his conscience 
was pure. It was one of his peculiarities that when his 
colour rose he looked angry, and Mr. Vetch held that 
his displeasure was a proof that in spite of his repudia- 
tions he had been unwise ; though before they parted 
Eustache gave this sign of softness, that he shed tears of 
emotion, of which the reason was not clear to the fiddler 
and which appeared in a general way to be dedicated to 
Hyacinth. The interview had taken place in Lisson 
Grove, where Madame Poupin, however, had not shown 
herself. 

Altogether the old man was a prey to suppositions which 
led him to feel how much he himself had outlived the 
democratic glow of his prime. He had ended by accepting 
everything (though, indeed, he couldn't swallow the idea 
that a trick should be played upon Hyacinth), and even by 
taking an interest in current politics, as to which, of old, he 
had held the opinion (the same that the Poupins held to-day), 
that they had been invented on purpose to throw dust in 
the eyes of disinterested reformers and to circumvent the 
social solution. He had given up that problem some time 
ago ; there was no way to clear it up that didn't seem to 
make a bigger mess than the actual muddle of human 
affairs, which, by the time one had reached sixty-five, had 
mostly ceased to exasperate. Mr. Vetch could still feel a 
certain sharpness on the subject of the prayer-book and the 
bishops ; and if at moments he was a little ashamed of 
having accepted this world he could reflect that at all events 
he continued to repudiate every other. The idea of great 
changes, however, took its place among the dreams of his 





youth ; for what was any possible change in the relations of 
men and women but a new combination of the same 
elements ? If the elements could be made different the 
thing would be worth thinking of; but it was not only 
impossible to introduce any new ones no means had yet 
been discovered for getting rid of the old. The figures on 
the chessboard were still the passions and jealousies and 
superstitions and stupidities of man, and their position with 
regard to each other, at any given moment, could be of 
interest only to the grim, invisible fates who played the 
game who sat, through the ages, bow-backed over the 
table. This laxity had come upon the old man with the 
increase of his measurement round the waist, of the little 
heap of half-crowns and half-sovereigns that had accumulated 
in a tin box with a very stiff padlock, which he kept under 
his bed, and of the interwoven threads of sentiment and 
custom that united him to the dressmaker and her foster- 
son. If he was no longer pressing about the demands he 
felt he should have a right to make of society, as he had 
been in the days when his conversation scandalised Finnic, 
so he was now not pressing for Hyacinth, either ; reflecting 
that though, indeed, the constituted powers might have to 
' count ' with him, it would be in better taste for him not to 
be importunate about a settlement. What he had come to 
fear for him was that he should be precipitated by crude 
agencies, with results in which the deplorable might not 
exclude the ridiculous. It may even be said that Mr. 
Vetch had a secret project of settling a little on his 
behalf. 

Lady Aurora peeped into the room, very noiselessly, 
nearly half an hour after Hyacinth had left it, and let the 



 

fiddler know that she was called to other duties but that the 
nurse had come back and the doctor had promised to look 
in at five o'clock. She herself would return in the evening, 
and meanwhile Hyacinth was with his aunt, who had 
recognised him, without a protest ; indeed seemed intensely 
happy that he should be near her again, and lay there with 
closed eyes, very weak and speechless, with his hand in 
hers. Her restlessness had passed and her fever abated, 
but she had no pulse to speak of and Lady Aurora did not 
disguise the fact that, in her opinion, she was rapidly sink- 
ing. Mr. Vetch had already accepted it, and after her 
ladyship had quitted him he lighted another philosophic 
pipe upon it, lingering on, till the doctor came, in the dress- 
maker's dismal, forsaken bower, where, in past years, he had 
indulged in so many sociable droppings-in and hot tumblers. 
The echo of all her little simple surprises and pointless 
contradictions, her gasping reception of contemplative 
paradox, seemed still to float in the air ; but the place felt 
as relinquished and bereaved as if she were already beneath 
the sod. Pinnie had always been a wonderful hand at 
' putting away' ; the litter that testified to her most elaborate 
efforts was often immense, but the reaction in favour of an 
unspeckled carpet was greater still; and on the present 
occasion, before taking to her bed, she had found strength 
to sweep and set in order as daintily as if she" had been 
sure that the room would never again know her care. Even 
to the old fiddler, who had not Hyacinth's sensibility to 
the scenery of life, it had the cold propriety of a place 
arranged for an interment. After the doctor had seen 
Pinnie, that afternoon, there was no doubt left as to its soon 
being the stage of dismal preliminaries. 





Miss Pynsent, however, resisted her malady for nearly a 
fortnight more, during which Hyacinth was constantly in 
her room. He never went back to Mr. Crookenden's, with 
whose establishment, through violent causes, his relations 
seemed indefinitely suspended ; and in fact, for the rest of 
the time that Pinnie demanded his care he absented himself 
but twice from Lomax Place for more than a few minutes. 
On one of these occasions he travelled over to Audley Court 
and spent an hour there ; on the other he met Millicent 
Henning, by appointment, and took a walk with her on the 
Embankment. He tried to find a moment to go and thank 
Madame Poupin for a sympathetic offering, many times 
repeated, of tisane, concocted after a receipt thought supreme 
by the couple in Lisson Grove (though little appreciated in 
the neighbourhood generally) ; but he was obliged to acknow- 
ledge her kindness only by a respectful letter, which he 
composed with some trouble, though much elation, in the 
French tongue, peculiarly favourable, as he believed, to 
little courtesies of this kind. Lady Aurora came again and 
again to the darkened house, where she diffused her beneficent 
influence in nightly watches, in the most modern sanative sug- 
gestions, in conversations with Hyacinth, directed with more 
ingenuity than her fluttered embarrassments might have led 
one to attribute to her, to the purpose of diverting his mind, 
and in tea-makings (there was a great deal of this liquid con- 
sumed on the premises during Pinnie's illness), after a 
system more enlightened than the usual fashion of Penton- 
ville. She was the bearer of several messages and of a good 
deal of medical advice from Rose Muniment, whose interest 
in the dressmaker's case irritated Hyacinth by its fine 
courage, which even at second-hand was still obtrusive; 



 

she appeared very nearly as resigned to the troubles of 
others as she was to her own. 

Hyacinth had been seized, the day after his return from 
Medley, with a sharp desire to do something enterprising 
and superior on Pinnie's behalf. He felt the pressure of a 
sort of angry sense that she was dying of her poor career, 
of her uneffaced remorse for the trick she had played him 
in his boyhood (as if he hadn't long ago, and indeed at the 
time, forgiven it, judging it to have been the highest 
wisdom !) of something basely helpless in the attitude of 
her little circle. He wanted to do something which should 
prove to himself that he had got the best opinion about 
the invalid that it was possible to have : so he insisted that 
Mr. Buffery should consult with a West End doctor, if the 
West End doctor would consent to meet Mr. Buffery. A 
physician capable of this condescension was discovered 
through Lady Aurora's agency (she had not brought him 
of her own movement, because on the one hand she 
hesitated to impose on the little household in Lomax 
Place the expense of such a visit, and on the other, with 
all her narrow personal economies for the sake of her 
charities, had not the means to meet it herself) ; and in 
prevision of the great man's fee Hyacinth applied to Mr. 
Vetch, as he had applied before, for a loan. The great 
man came, and was wonderfully civil to Mr. Buffery, whose 
conduct of the case he pronounced judicious ; he remained 
several minutes in the house, while he gazed at Hyacinth 
over his spectacles (he seemed rather more occupied with 
him than with the patient), and almost the whole of the 
Place turned out to stare at his chariot. After all, he 
consented to accept no fee. He put the question aside 



with a gesture full of urbanity a course disappointing and 
displeasing to Hyacinth, who felt in a manner cheated of 
the full effect of the fine thing he had wished to do for 
Pinnie ; though when he said as much (or something like 
it) to Mr. Vetch, the caustic fiddler greeted the observation 
with a face of amusement which, considering the situation, 
verged upon the unseemly. 

Hyacinth, at any rate, had done the best he could, and 
the fashionable doctor had left directions which foreshadowed 
relations with an expensive chemist in Bond Street a 
prospect by which our young man was to some extent 
consoled. Poor Pinnie's decline, however, was not arrested,
