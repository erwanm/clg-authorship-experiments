She had worn a thick veil, and on coming in had thrown it 
back upon her head the veils of those days were long and 
heavy, and fell about the head and neck like a drapery. 

' Corona ! ' Giovanni cried, stretching out his hands 
towards her. Something in her face prevented him from 
throwing his arms round her, something not like her usual 
coldness and reproachful look that kept him back. 

' Giovanni was it kind to leave me so ? ' she asked, 
without moving from her place. 

The question corresponded so closely with his own feel 
ings that he had anticipated it, though he had no answer 
ready. She knew all, and was hurt by what he had done. 
What could he say ? The reasons that had sent him so 
boldly into danger no longer seemed even sufficient for an 
excuse. The happiness he had anticipated in seeing her 
had vanished almost before it had made itself felt. His 
first emotion was bitter anger against the cardinal. No one 
else could have told her, for no one else knew what he had 
done nor where he was. Giovanni thought, and with 
reason, that the great man might have spared his wife such 
a blow. 

' I believed I was doing what was best when I did it,' 
he answered, scarcely knowing what to say. 

'Was it best to leave me without a word, except a 
message of excuse for others ? ' 

' For you was it not better ? For me what does it 
matter ? Should I be happier anywhere else ? ' 

' Have I driven you from your home, Giovanni V asked 
Corona, with a strange look in her dark eyes. Her voice 
trembled. 

' No, not you,' he answered, turning away and beginning 
to walk up and down by the force of the habit he had 
acquired during the last two or three days. 'Not you,' 
he repeated more than once in a bitter tone. 

Corona sank down upon the chair he had left, and 
buried her face in her hands, as though overcome by a great 
and sudden grief. Giovanni stopped before her and looked 
at her, not clearly understanding what was passing in her 
mind. 





' Why are you so sorry V he asked. ' Has a separation of 
a few days changed you ? Are you sorry for me ? ' 

'Why did you come here?' she exclaimed, instead of 
answering his question. ' Why here, of all places ?' 

' I had no choice. The cardinal decided the matter for 
me.' 

' The cardinal ? Why do you confide in him ? You 
never did before. I may be wrong, but I do not trust him, 
kind as he has always been. If you wanted advice, you 
might have gone to Padre Filippo ' 

'Advice? I do not understand you, Corona.' 

' Did you not go to the cardinal and tell him that you 
were very unhappy and wanted to make a retreat in some 
quiet place where nobody could find you ? And did he not 
advise you to come here, promising to keep your secret, and 
authorising you to stay as long as you pleased 2 That is 
what he told me.' 

' He told you that ? ' cried Giovanni in great astonish 
ment. 

' Yes that and nothing more. He came to see me late 
this afternoon. He said that he feared lest I should be 
anxious about your long absence, and that he thought him 
self justified in telling me where you were and in giving me 
a pass, in case I wanted to see you. Besides, if it is not all 
as he says, how did you come here ?' 

' You do not know the truth ? You do not know what I 
did ? You do not guess why I am in the Holy Office ? ' 

' I know only what he told me,' answered Corona, sur 
prised by Giovanni's questions. 

But Giovanni gave no immediate explanation. He paced 
the floor in a state of excitement in which she had never 
seen him, clasping and unclasping his fingers nervously, and 
uttering short, incoherent exclamations. As she watched 
him a sensation of fear crept over her, but she did not ask 
him any question. He stopped suddenly again. 

'You do not know that I am in prison ?' 

' In prison ! ' She rose with a sharp cry and seized his 
hands in hers. 

' Do not be frightened, dear,' he said in an altered tone. 




' I am perfectly innocent. After all, you know it is a 
prison.' 

' Ah, Giovanni ! ' she exclaimed reproachfully, ' how could 
you say such a dreadful thing, even in jest V She had 
dropped his hands again, and drew back a step as she 
spoke. 

' It is not a jest. It is earnest. Do not start. I will 
tell you just what happened. It is "best, after all. When I 
left you at the Termini, I saw that you had set your heart 
on liberating poor Faustina. I could not find any way of 
accomplishing what you desired, and I saw that you thought 
I was not doing my best for her freedom. I went directly 
to the cardinal and gave myself up in her place.' 

' As a hostage a surety ? ' asked Corona, breath 
lessly. 

' No. He would not have accepted that, for he was pre 
judiced against her. I gave myself up as the murderer.' 

He spoke quite calmly, as though he had been narrating 
a commonplace occurrence. For an instant she stood before 
him, dumb and horror-struck. Then with a great heart 
broken cry she threw her arms round him and clasped him 
passionately to her breast. 

' My beloved ! My beloved !' 

For some moments she held him so closely that he could 
neither move nor see her face, but the beating of his heart 
told him that a great change had in that instant come over 
his life. The cry had come from her soul, irresistibly, spon 
taneously. There was an accent in the two words she 
repeated which he had never hoped to hear again. He had 
expected that she would reproach him for his madness. 
Instead of that, his folly had awakened the love that was not 
dead, though it had been so desperately wounded. 

Presently she drew back a little and looked into his eyes, 
a fierce deep light burning in her own. 

' I love you,' she said, almost under her breath. 

A wonderful smile passed over his face, illuminating the 
dark, stern lines of it like a ray of heavenly light. Then 
the dusky eyelids slowly closed, as though by their own 
weight, his head fell back, and his lips turned white. She 



 

felt the burden of his body in her arms, and but for her 
strength he would have fallen to the floor. She reeled on 
her feet, holding him still, and sank down until she knelt 
and his head rested on her knee. Her heart stood still as 
she listened for the sound of his faint breathing. Had his 
unconsciousness lasted longer she would have fainted herself. 
But in a moment his eyes opened again with an expression 
such as she had seen in them once or twice before, but in a 
less degree. 

' Corona it is too much ! ' he said softly, almost dreamily. 
Then his strength returned in an instant, like a strong steel 
bow that has been bent almost to breaking. He scarcely 
knew how it was that the position was changed so that he 
was standing on his feet and clasping her as she had clasped 
him. Her tears were flowing fast, but there was more joy 
in them than pain. 

' How could you do it ?' she asked at length, looking up. 
' And oh, Giovanni ! what will be the end of it ? Will not 
something dreadful happen ?' 

' What does anything matter now, darling ?' 

At last they sat down together, hand in hand, as of old. 
It was as though the last two months had been suddenly 
blotted out. As Giovanni said, nothing could matter now. 
And yet the situation was far from clear. Giovanni under 
stood well enough that the cardinal had wished to leave him 
the option of telling his wife what had occurred, and, if he 
chose to do so, of telling her in his own language. He was 
grateful for the tact the statesman had displayed, a tact which 
seemed also to show Giovanni the cardinal's views of the 
case. He had declared that he was desperate. The cardinal 
had concluded that he was unhappy. He had said that he 
did not care what became of him. The cardinal had sup 
posed that he would be glad to be alone, or at all events 
that it would be good for him to have a certain amount of 
solitude. If his position were in any way dangerous, the 
great man would surely not have thought of sending Corona 
to his prisoner as he had done. He would have prepared 
her himself against any shock. And yet he was undeniably 
in prison, with no immediate prospect of liberty. 






'You cannot stay here any longer,' said Corona when 
they were at last ahle to talk of the immediate future. 

' I do not see how I am to get out,' Giovanni answered, 
with a smile. 

'I will go to the cardinal ' 

' It is of no use. He probably guesses the truth, but he 
is not willing to be made ridiculous by me or by any one. 
He will keep me here until there can be a trial, or until he 
finds the real culprit. He is obstinate. I know him.' 

' It is impossible that he should think of such a thing ! ' 
exclaimed Corona indignantly. 

'I am afraid it is very possible. But, of course, it is 
only a matter of time a few days at the utmost. If worst 
comes to worst I can demand an inquiry, I suppose, though 
I do not see how I can proclaim my own innocence without 
hurting Faustina. She was liberated because I put myself 
in her place it is rather complicated.' 

' Tell me, Giovanni,' said Corona, ' what did you say to 
the cardinal? You did not really say that you murdered 
Monte varchi V 

 I said I gave myself up as the murderer, and I 
explained how I might have done the deed. I did more, I 
pledged my honour that Faustina was innocent.' 

' But you were not sure of it yourself ' 

'Since you had told me it was true, I believed it,' he 
answered simply. 

' Thank you, dear ' 

' No. Do not thank me for it. I could not help myself. 
I knew that you were sure are you sure of something else, 
Corona ? Are you as certain as you were of that ?' 

' How can you ask ? But you are right you have the 
right to doubt me. You will not, though, will you ? Hear 
me, dear, while I tell you the whole story.' 

She slipped from her chair and knelt before him, as 
though she were to make a confession. Then she took his 
hands and looked up lovingly into his face. The truth rose 
in her eyes. 

' Forgive me, Giovanni. Yes, you have much to forgive. 
I did not know myself. When you doubted me, I felt as 


 

though I had nothing left in life, as though you would nevei 
again believe in me. I thought I did not love you. I was 
wrong. It was only iny miserable vanity that was wounded, 
and that hurt me so. I felt that my love was dead, that you 
yourself were dead and that another man had taken your 
place. Ah, I could have helped it ! Had I known you 
better, dear, had I been less mistaken in myself, all would 
have been different. But I was foolish no, I was unhappy. 
Everything was dark and dreadful. Oh, my darling, I 
thought I could tell what I felt I cannot! Forgive me, 
only forgive me, and love me as you did long ago. I will 
never leave you, not if you stay here for ever, only let me 
love you as I will ! ' 

' It is not for me to forgive, sweetheart,' said Giovanni, 
bending down and kissing her sweet dark hair. ' It is for 
you ' 

'But I would so much rather think it my fault, dear,' 
she answered, drawing his face down to hers. It was a 
very womanly impulse that made her take the blame upon 
herself. 

' You must not think anything so unreasonable, Corona. 
I brought all the harm that came, from the first moment.' 

He would have gone on to accuse himself, obstinate and 
manlike, recapitulating the whole series of events. But she 
would not let him. Once more she sat beside him and held 
his hand in hers. They talked incoherently and it is not 
to be wondered at if they arrived at no very definite con 
clusion after a very long conversation. They were still 
sitting together when the attendant entered and presented 
Giovanni with a large sealed letter, bearing the Apostolic 
arms, and addressed merely to the number of Giovanni's cell. 

'There is an answer,' said the man, and then left the 
room. 

' It is probably the notice of the trial, or something of 
the kind,' observed Giovanni, suddenly growing very grave 
as he broke the seal. He wished it might have come at any 
other time than the present. Corona held her breath and 
watched his face while he read the lines written upon one of 
the two papers he took from the envelope. Suddenly the 



colour came to his cheeks and his eyes brightened with a 
look of happiness and surprise. 

' I am free ! ' he cried, as he finished. ' Free if I will 
sign this paper ! Of course I will ! I will sign anything he 
likes.' 

The envelope contained a note from the cardinal, in his 
own hand, to the effect that suspicion had fallen upon 
another person and that Giovanni was at liberty to return to 
his home if he would sign the accompanying document 
The latter was very short, and set forth that Giovanni 
Saracinesca bound himself upon his word to appear in the 
trial of the murderer of Prince Montevarchi, if called upon 
to do so, and not to leave Rome until the matter was finally 
concluded and set at rest. 

He took the pen that lay on the table and signed his 
name in a broad firm hand, a fact the more notable because 
Corona was leaning over his shoulder, watching the characters 
as he traced them. He folded the paper and placed it in 
the open envelope which accompanied it. The cardinal was 
a man of details. He thought it possible that the document 
might be returned open for lack of the means to seal it He 
did not choose that his secrets should become the property of 
the people about the Holy Office. It was a specimen of his 
forethought in small things which might have an influence 
upon great ones. 

When Giovanni had finished, he rose and stood beside 
Corona. Each looked into the other's eyes and for a 
moment neither saw very clearly. They said little more, 
however, until the attendant entered again. 

' You are at liberty,' he said briefly, and without a word 
began to put together the few small things that belonged to 
his late prisoner. 

Half an hour later Giovanni was seated at dinner at his 
father's table. The old gentleman greeted him with a half- 
savage growl of satisfaction. 

' The prodigal has returned to get a meal while there is 
one to be had,' he remarked. ' I thought you had gone to 
Paris to leave the agreeable settlement of our affairs to 
Corona and me. Where the devil have you been V 





' I have been indulging in the luxury of a retreat in a 
religious house,' answered Giovanni with perfect truth. 

Corona glanced at him and both laughed happily, as 
they had not laughed for many days and weeks. Saracinesca 
looked incredulously across the table at his son. 

' You chose a singular moment for your devotional exer 
cises,' he said. ' Where will piety hide herself next, I 
wonder ? As long as Corona is satisfied, I am. It is her 
business.' 

' I am perfectly satisfied, I assure you,' said Corona, whose 
black eyes were full of light. 

Giovanni raised his glass, looked at her and smiled 
lovingly. Then he emptied it to the last drop and set it 
down without a word. 

' Some secret, I suppose,' said the old gentleman gruffly. 



CHAPTEK XXYIH 

ARNOLDO MESCHINI was not, perhaps, insane in the ordinary 
sense of the word ; that is to say, he would probably have 
recovered the normal balance of his faculties if he could have 
been kept from narcotics and stimulants, and if he could 
have been relieved from the distracting fear of discovery 
which tormented him when he was not under the influence 
of one or the other. But the latter condition was impos 
sible, and it was the extremity of his terror which almost 
forced him to keep his brain in a clouded state. People 
have been driven mad by sudden fright, and have gradually 
lost their intellect through the constant presence of a fear 
from which there is no escape. A man who is perpetually 
producing an unnatural state of his mind by swallowing 
doses of brandy and opium may not be insane in theory ; in 
actual fact, he may be a dangerous madman. As one day 
followed another Meschini found it more and more impos 
sible to exist without his two comforters. The least approach 
to lucidity made him almost frantic. He fancied every man 
a spy, every indifferent glance a look full of meaning. 
Before long the belief took possession of him that he was 




to be made the victim of some horrible private vengeance. 
San Giacinto was not the man, he thought, to be contented 
with sending him to the galleys for life. Few murderers 
were executed in those days, and it would be a small satis 
faction to the Montevarchi to know that Arnoldo had merely 
been transferred from his study of the library catalogue to 
the breaking of stones with a chain gang at Civitavecchia. 
It was more likely that they would revenge themselves more 
effectually. His disordered imagination saw horrible visions. 
San Giacinto might lay a trap for him, might simply come 
at dead of night and take him from his room to some deep 
vault beneath the palace. What could he do against such a 
giant ? He fancied himself before a secret tribunal in the 
midst of which towered San Giacinto's colossal figure. He 
could hear the deep voice he dreaded pronouncing his doom. 
He was to be torn to shreds piecemeal, burnt by a slow fire, 
flayed alive by those enormous hands. There was no con 
ceivable horror of torture that did not suggest itself to him 
at such times. It is true that when he went to bed at night 
he was generally either so stupefied by opium or so intoxicated 
with strong drink that he forgot even to lock his door. But 
during the day he was seldom so far under the power of either 
as not to suffer from his own hideous imaginings. One day, 
as he dragged his slow pace along a narrow street near the 
fountain of Trevi, his eyes were arrested by an armourer's 
window. It suddenly struck him that he had no weapon 
of defence in case San Giacinto or his agents came upon him 
unawares. And yet a bullet well placed would make an 
end even of such a Hercules as the man he feared. He 
paused and looked anxiously up and down the street. It 
was a dark day and a fine rain was falling. There was 
nobody about who could recognise him, and he might not 
have another such opportunity of providing himself unob 
served with what he wanted. He entered the shop and 
bought himself a revolver. The man showed him how to 
load it and sold him a box of cartridges. He dropped the 
firearm into one of the pockets of his coat, and smiled as he 
felt how comfortably it balanced the bottle he carried in the 
other. Then he slunk out of the shop and pursued his walk. 



 

The idea of making capital out of the original deeds con 
cerning the Saracinesca, which had presented itself to him 
soon after the murder recurred frequently to his mind ; but 
he felt that he was in no condition to elaborate it, and 
promised himself to attend to the matter when he was better. 
For he fancied that he was ill and that his state would soon 
begin to improve. To go to San Giacinto now was out of 
the question. It would have been easier for him to climb 
the cross on the summit of St. Peter's, with his shaken 
nerves and trembling limbs, than to face the man who in 
spired in him such untold dread. He could, of course, take 
the alternative which was open to him, and go to old Sara 
cinesca. Indeed, there were moments when he could almost 
have screwed his courage to the point of making such an 
attempt, but his natural prudence made him draw back from 
an interview in which he must incur a desperate risk unless 
he had a perfect command of his faculties. To write what 
he had to say would be merely to give a weapon against 
himself, since he could not treat the matter by letter without 
acknowledging his share in the forgeries. The only way to 
accomplish his purpose would be to extract a solemn promise 
of secrecy from Saracinesca, together with a guarantee for 
his own safety, and to obtain these conditions would need 
all the diplomacy he possessed. Bad as he was, he had no 
experience of practical blackmailing, and he would be obliged 
to compose his speeches beforehand with scrupulous care, 
and with the wisest forethought. For the present, such 
work was beyond his power, but when he was half drunk 
he loved to look at the ancient parchments and build golden 
palaces in the future. When he was strong again, and calm, 
he would realise all his dreams, and that time, he felt sure, 
could not be far removed. 

Nevertheless the days succeeded each other with appalling 
swiftness, and nothing was done. By imperceptible degrees 
his horror of San Giacinto began to invade his mind even 
when it was most deadened by drink So long as an idea 
is new and has not really become a habit of the brain, brandy 
will drive it away, but the moment must inevitably come 
when the stimulant loses its power to obscure the memory 



xxvm SANT 7 ILARIO 407 

of the thing dreaded. Opium will do it more effectually, 
but even that does not continue to act for ever. The time 
comes when the predominant thought of the waking hours 
reproduces itself during the artificial sleep with fearful force, 
so that the mind at last obtains no rest at all. That is the 
dangerous period, preceding the decay and total collapse of 
the intellect under what is commonly called the fixed idea. 
In certain conditions of mind, and notably with criminals 
who fear discovery, the effects of opium change very 
quickly ; the downward steps through which it would take 
months for an ordinary individual to pass are descended 
with alarming rapidity, and the end is a thousand times 
more horrible. Meschini could not have taken the doses 
which a confirmed opium-eater swallows with indifference, 
but the result produced was far greater in proportion to the 
amount of the narcotic he consumed. Before the week which 
followed the deed was ended, he began to see visions when 
he was apparently awake. Shapeless, slimy things crawled 
about the floor of his room, upon his table, even upon the 
sheets of his bed. Dark shadows confronted him, and 
changed their outlines unexpectedly. Forms rose out of the 
earth at his feet and towered all at once to the top of the 
room, taking the appearance of San Giacinto and vanishing 
suddenly into the air. The things he saw came like instan 
taneous flashes from another and even more terrible world, dis 
appearing at first so quickly as to make him believe them 
only the effects of the light and darkness, like the ghost he 
had seen in his coat. In the beginning there was scarcely 
anything alarming in them, but as he started whenever they 
came, he generally tool^ them as a warning that he needed 
more brandy to keep him up. In the course of a day or 
two, however, these visions assumed more awful proportions, 
and he found it impossible to escape from them except in 
absolute stupor. It would have been clear to any one that 
this state of things could not last long. There was scarcely 
an hour in which he knew exactly what he was doing, and 
if his strange behaviour escaped observation this was due to 
his solitary way of living. He did not keep away from the 
palace during the whole day, from a vague idea that his 





absence might be thought suspicious. He spent a certain 
number of hours in the library, doing nothing, although he 
carefully spread out a number of books before him and 
dipped his pen into the ink from time to time, stupidly, 
mechanically, as though his fingers could not forget the 
habit so long familiar to them. His eyes, which had 
formerly been unusually bright, had grown dull and 
almost bleared, though they glanced at times very quickly 
from one part of the room to another. That was when he 
saw strange things moving in the vast hall, between him and 
the bookcases. When they had disappeared, his glassy look 
returned, so that his eyeballs seemed merely to reflect the 
light, as inanimate objects do, without absorbing it, and 
conveying it to the seat of vision. His face grew daily 
more thin and ghastly. It was by force of custom that he 
stayed so long in the place where he had spent so much of 
his life. The intervals of semi-lucidity seemed terribly 
long, though they were in reality short enough, and the 
effort to engage his attention in work helped him to live 
through them. He had never gone down to the apartments 
where the family lived, since he had knelt before the cata 
falque on the day after the murder. Indeed, there was no 
reason why he should go there, and no one noticed his 
absence. He was a very insignificant person in the palace. 
As for any one coming to find him among the books, nothing 
seemed more improbable. The library was swept out in the 
early morning and no one entered it again during the 
twenty-four hours. He never went out into the corridor, 
now, but left his coat upon a chair near him, when he remem 
bered to bring it. As a sort of precautionary measure 
against fear, he locked the door which opened upon the 
passage when he came in the morning, unlocking it again 
when he went away in order that the servant who did the 
sweeping might be able to get in. 

The Princess Montevarchi was still dangerously ill, and 
Faustina had not been willing to leave her. San Giacinto 
and Flavia were not living in the house, but they spent a 
good deal of time there, because San Giacinto had ideas of 
his own about duty, to which his wife was obliged to submit 



xxvni  409 

even if she did not like them. Faustina was neither nervous 
nor afraid of solitude, and was by no means in need of her 
sister's company, so that when the two were together their 
conversation was not always of the most affectionate kind. 
The consequence was that the young girl tried to be alone 
as much as possible when she was not at her mother's bed 
side. One day, having absolutely nothing to do, she grew 
desperate. It was very hard not to think of Anastase, when 
she was in the solitude of her own room, with no occupation 
to direct her mind. A week earlier she had been only too 
glad to have the opportunity of dreaming away the short after 
noon undisturbed, letting her girlish thoughts wander among 
the rose gardens of the future with the image of the man she 
loved so dearly, and who was yet so far removed from her. 
Now she could not think of him without reflecting that her 
father's death had removed one very great obstacle to her 
marriage. She was by no means of a very devout or 
saintly character, but, on the other hand, she had a great 
deal of what is called heart, and to be heartless seemed to 
her almost worse than to be bad. In excuse of such very 
untheological doctrines it must be allowed that her ideas 
concerning wickedness in general were very limited indeed, 
if not altogether childish in their extreme simplicity. It is 
certain, however, that she would have thought it far less 
wrong to run away with Gouache in spite of her family than 
to entertain any thought which could place her father's 
tragic death in the light of a personal advantage. If she 
had nothing to do she could not help thinking of Anastase, 
and if she thought of him, she could not escape the con 
clusion that it would be far easier for her to marry him, now 
that the old prince was out of the way. It was therefore 
absolutely necessary to find some occupation. 

At first she wandered aimlessly about the house until she 
was struck, almost for the first time, by the antiquated stiff 
ness of the arrangement, and began to ask herself whether 
it would be respectful to the memory of her father, and to 
her mother, to try and make a few changes. Corona's home 
was very different. She would like to take that for a model. 
But one or two attempts showed her the magnitude of the 



task she had undertaken. She was ashamed to call the 
servants to help her it would look as though there were 
to be a reception in the house. Her ideas of what could 
take place in the Palazzo Montevarchi did not go beyond 
that staid form of diversion. She was ashamed, however, 
and reflected, besides, that she was only the youngest of the 
family and had no right to take the initiative in the matter 
of improvements. The time hung very heavily upon her 
hands. She tried to teach herself something about painting 
by looking at the pictures on the walls, spending a quarter 
of an hour before each with conscientious assiduity. But 
this did not succeed either. The men in the pictures all 
took the shape of Monsieur Gouache in his smartest uniform 
and the women all looked disagreeably like Flavia. Then 
she thought of the library, which was the only place of im 
portance in the house which she had not lately visited. 
She hesitated a moment only, considering how she could 
best reach it without passing through the study, and without 
going up the grand staircase to the outer door. A very 
little reflection showed her that she could get into the 
corridor from a passage near her own room. In a few 
minutes she was at the entrance to the great hall, trying to 
turn the heavy carved brass handle of the latch. To her 
surprise she could not open the door, which was evidently 
fastened from within. Then as she shook it in the hope that 
some one would hear her, a strange cry reached her ears, 
like that of a startled animal, accompanied by the shuffling 
of feet. She remembered Meschini's walk, and understood 
that it was he. 

' Please let me in ! ' she called out in her clear 
young voice, that echoed back to her from the vaulted 
chamber. 

Again she heard the shuffling footsteps, which this time 
came towards her, and a moment afterwards the door opened 
and the librarian's ghastly face was close before her. She 
drew back a little. She had forgotten that he was so ugly, 
she thought, or perhaps she would not have cared to see 
him. It would have been foolish, moreover, to go away after 
coming thus far. 



' I want to see the library,' she said quietly, after she had 
made up her mind. ' Will you show it to me ? ' 

' Favorisca, Excellency,' replied Meschini in a broken 
voice. He had been frightened by the noise at the door, 
and the contortion of his face as he tried to smile was 
hideous to see. He bowed low, however, and closed the 
door after she had entered. Scarcely knowing what he did, 
he shuffled along by her side while she looked about the 
library, gazing at the long rows of books, bound all alike, 
that stretched from end to end of many of the shelves. The 
place was new to her, for she had not been in it more than 
two or three times in her life, and she felt a sort of unex 
plained awe in the presence of so many thousands of volumes, 
of so much written and printed wisdom which she could 
never hope to understand. She had come with a vague 
idea that she should find something to read that should be 
different from the novels she was not allowed to touch. 
She realised all at once that she knew nothing of what had 
been written in all the centuries whose literature was 
represented in the vast collection. She hardly knew the 
names of twenty books out of the hundreds of millions that 
the world contained. But she could ask Meschini. She 
looked at him again, and his face repelled her. Neverthe 
less, she was too kindhearted not to enter into conversation 
with the lonely man whom she had so rarely seen, but who 
was one of the oldest members of her father's household. 

'You have spent your life here, have you not?' she 
asked, for the sake of saying something. 

' Nearly thirty years of it,' answered Meschini in a 
muffled voice. Her presence tortured him beyond expres 
sion. ' That is a long time, and I am not an old man.' 

' And are you always alone here ? Do you never go out ? 
What do you do all day ? ' 

' I work among the books, Excellency. There are twenty 
thousand volumes here, enough to occupy a man's time.' 

' Yes but how ? Do you have to read them all V asked 
Faustina innocently. ' Is that your work ? ' 

' I have read many more than would be believed, for my 
own pleasure. But my work is to keep them in order, to 



see that there is no variation from the catalogue, so that 
when learned men come to make inquiries they may find 
what they want. I have also to take care of all the books, 
to see that they do not suffer in any way. They are very 
valuable. There is a fortune here.' 

Somehow he felt less nervous when he began to speak of 
the library and its contents and the words came more easily 
to him. With a little encouragement he might even become 
loquacious. In spite of his face, Faustina began to feel an 
interest in him. 

' It must be very hard work,' she remarked. ' Do you 
like it? Did you never want to do anything else? I 
should think you would grow tired of being always alone.' 

' I am very patient,' answered Meschini humbly. ' And 
I am used to it. I grew accustomed to the life when I was 
young.' 

' You say the collection is valuable. Are there any very 
beautiful books ? I would like to see some of them.' 

The fair young creature sat down upon one of the high 
carved chairs at the end of a table. Meschini went to the 
other side of the hall and unlocked one of the drawers which 
lined the lower part of the bookcases to the height of three 
or four feet. Each was heavily carved with the Montevarchi 
arms in high relief. It was in these receptacles that the 
precious manuscripts were kept in their cases. He returned 
bringing a small square volume of bound manuscript, and 
laid it before Faustina. 

"This is worth an enormous sum,' he said. 'It is the 
only complete one in the world. There is an imperfect 
copy in the library of the Vatican.' 

'What is it?' 

' It is the Montevarchi Dante, the oldest in existence.' 

Faustina turned over the leaves curiously, and admired 
the even writing though she could not read many of the 
words, for the ancient characters were strange to her. It was 
a wonderful picture that the couple made in the great hall 
On every side the huge carved bookcases of walnut, black 
with age, rose from the floor to the spring of the vault, their 
dark faces reflected in the highly-polished floor of coloured 





marble. Across the ancient tables a ray of sunlight fell from 
the high clere-story window. In the centre, the two figures 
with the old manuscript between them ; Faustina's angel 
head in a high light against the dusky background, as she 
bent forward a little, turning the yellow pages with her 
slender, transparent fingers, the black folds of her full gown 
making heavy lines of drapery, graceful by her grace, and 
rendered less severe by a sort of youthfulness that seemed 
to pervade them, and that emanated from herself. Beside 
her, the bent frame of the broken down librarian, in a 
humble and respectful attitude, his long arms hanging down 
by his sides, his shabby black coat almost dragging to his 
heels, his head bent forward as he looked at the pages. All 
his features seemed to have grown more sharp and yellow 
and pointed, and there was now a deep red flush in the 
upper part of his cheeks. A momentary light shone in his 
gray eyes, from beneath the bushy brows, a light of intelli 
gence such as had formerly characterised them especially, 
brought back now perhaps by the effort to fix his attention 
upon the precious book. His large, coarse ears appeared to 
point themselves forward like those of an animal, following 
the direction of his sight. In outward appearance he 
presented a strange mixture of dilapidation, keenness, and 
brutality. A week had changed him very much. A few 
days ago most people would have looked at him with a sort 
of careless compassion. Now, there was about him some 
thing distinctly repulsive. Beside Faustina's youth and 
delicacy, and freshness, he hardly seemed like a human 
being. 

' I suppose it is a very wonderful thing,' said the young 
girl at last, ' but I do not know enough to understand its 
value. Do my brothers ever come to the library?' She 
leaned back from the volume and glanced at Meschini's 
face, wondering how heaven could have made anything so 



' No. They never come,' replied the librarian, drawing 
the book towards him instinctively, as he would have done 
if his visitor had been a stranger, who might try to steal a 
page or two unless he were watched. 





'But my poor father was very fond of the books, was he 
not ? Did he not often come to see you here ? ' 

She was thinking so little of Meschini that she did not 
see that he turned suddenly white and shook like a man in 
an ague. It was what he had feared all along, ever since 
she had entered the room. She suspected him and had come, 
or had perhaps been sent by San Giacinto to draw him into 
conversation and to catch him in something which could be 
interpreted to be a confession of his crime. Had that been her 
intention, his behaviour would have left little doubt in her 
mind as to the truth of the accusation. His face betrayed 
him, his uncontrollable fear, his frightened eyes and tremb 
ling limbs. But she had only glanced at him, and her sight 
wandered to the bookcases for a moment. When she looked 
again he was moving away from her, along the table. She 
was surprised to see that his step was uncertain, and that he 
reeled against the heavy piece of furniture and grasped it for 
support. She started a little but did not rise. 

' Are you ill ? ' she asked. ' Shall I call some one ? ' 
He made no answer, but seemed to recover himself at 
the sound of her voice, for he shuffled away and disappeared 
behind the high carved desk on which lay the open 
catalogue. She thought she saw a flash of light reflected 
from some smooth surface, and immediately afterwards she 
heard a gurgling sound, which she did not understand. 
Meschini was fortifying himself with a draught. Then he 
reappeared, walking more steadily. He had received a 
severe shock, but, as usual, he had not the courage to run 
away, conceiving that flight would inevitably be regarded as 
a proof of guilt. 

' I am not well,' he said in explanation as he returned. 
' I am obliged to take medicine continually. I beg your 
Excellency to forgive me.' 

'I am sorry to hear that,' answered Faustina kindly. 

' Can we do nothing for you ? Have you all you need ? ' 
' Everything, thank you. I shall soon be well.' 
'I hope so, I am sure. What was I saying? Oh I 

was asking whether my poor father came often to the library. 

Was he fond of the books ? ' 




'His Excellency Heaven give him glory! he was a 
learned man. Yes, he came now and then.' Meschini 
took possession of the manuscript and carried it off rather 
suddenly to its place in the drawer. He was a long time in 
locking it up. Faustina watched him with some curiosity. 

' You were here that day, were you not ? ' she asked, as 
he turned towards her once more. The question was a 
natural one, considering the circumstances. 

' I think your Excellency was present when I was 
examined by the prefect,' answered Meschini in a curiously 
disagreeable tone. 

' True,' said Faustina. ' You said you had been here all 
day as usual. I had forgotten. How horrible it was. And 
you saw nobody, you heard nothing ? But I suppose it is 
too far from the study.' 

The librarian did not answer, but it was evident from 
his manner that he was very much disturbed. Indeed, he 
fancied that his worst fears were realised, and that Faustina 
was really trying to extract information from him for his 
own conviction. Her thoughts were actually very far from 
any such idea. She would have considered it quite as 
absurd to accuse the poor wretch before her as she had 
thought it outrageous that she herself should be suspected. 
Her father had always seemed to her a very imposing 
personage, and she could not conceive that he should have 
met his death at the hands of such a miserable creature as 
Arnoldo Meschini, who certainly had not the outward signs 
of physical strength or boldness. He, however, understood 
her words very differently and stood still, half way between 
her and the bookcases, asking himself whether it would not 
be better to take immediate steps for his "safety. His hand 
was behind him, feeling for the revolver in the pocket of his 
long coat. Faustina was singularly fearless, by nature, but 
if she had guessed the danger of her position she would 
probably have effected her escape very quickly, instead of 
continuing the conversation. 

' It is a very dreadful mystery,' she said, rising from her 
chair and walking slowly across the polished marble floor 
until she stood before a row of great volumes of which the 





colour had attracted her eye. ' It is the duty of us all to 
try and explain it. . Of course we shall know all about it 
some day, but it is very hard to be patient. Do you know ?' 
she turned suddenly and faced Meschini, speaking with a 
vehemence not usual for her. ' They suspected me, as if I 
could have done it, I, a weak girl ! And yet if I had the 
man before me the man who murdered him I believe I 
would kill him with my hands ! ' 

She moved forward a little, as she spoke, and tapped her 
small foot upon the pavement, as though to emphasise her 
words. Her soft brown eyes flashed with righteous anger, 
and her cheek grew pale at the thought of avenging her 
father. There must have been something very fierce in her 
young face, for Meschini's heart failed him, and his nerves 
seemed to collapse all at once. He tried to draw back from 
her, slipped and fell upon his knees with a sharp cry of fear. 
Even then, Faustina did not suspect the cause of his weak 
ness, but attributed it to the illness of which he had spoken. 
She sprang forward and attempted to help the poor creature 
to his feet, but instead of making an effort to rise, he seemed 
to be grovelling before her, uttering incoherent exclamations 
of terror. 

' Lean on me ! ' said Faustina, putting out her hand. 
' What is the matter ? Oh ! Are you going to die ! ' 

' Oh ! oh ! Do not hurt me pray in God's name ! ' 
cried Meschini, raising his eyes timidly. 

' Hurt you ? No ! Why should I hurt you ? You are 
ill we will have the doctor. Try and get up try and get 
to a chair.' 

Her tone reassured him a little, and her touch also, as 
she did her best to raise him to his feet. He struggled a 
little and at last stood up, leaning upon the bookcase, and 
panting with fright. 

' It is nothing,' he tried to say, catching his breath at 
every syllable. ' I am better my nerves your Excellency 
ugh ! what a coward I am ! ' 

The last exclamation, uttered in profound disgust of his 
own weakness, struck Faustina as very strange. 

' Did I frighten you ? ' she asked in surprise. ' I am 




very sorry. Now sit down and I will call some one to come 
to you.' 

' No, no ! Please I would rather be alone ! I can 
walk quite well now. If if your Excellency will excuse 
me, I will go to my room. I have more medicine I will 
take it and I shall be better.' 

' Can you go alone ? Are you sure ? ' asked Faustina 
anxiously. But even while she spoke he was moving 
towards the door, slowly and painfully at first, as it seemed, 
though possibly a lingering thought of propriety kept him 
from appearing to run away. The young girl walked a few 
steps after him, half fearing that he might fall again. But 
he kept his feet and reached the threshold. Then he made 
a queer attempt at a bow, and mumbled some words that 
Faustina could not hear. In another moment he had
