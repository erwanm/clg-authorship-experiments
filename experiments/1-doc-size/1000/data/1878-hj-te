"One always wants a beau cousin, if one has 
one ! But if you are very nice to me in future I 
won't remember it against you." And Madame 
Miinster transferred her smile to the other persons 



 

present. It rested first upon the candid counte- 
nance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand, whose 
eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as 
if to beg him not to prolong an anomalous sit- 
uation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name. 
Eugenia gave him a very charming glance, and 
then looked at the other gentleman. 

This latter personage was a man of rather less 
than the usual stature and the usual weight, with 
a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a small 
quantity of thin dark hair, and a small mustache. 
He had been standing with his hands in his 
pockets ; and when Eugenia looked at him he 
took them out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, 
look evasively and urgently at their host. He 
met Eugenia's eyes ; he appeared to appreciate 
the privilege of meeting them. Madame Minister 
instantly felt that he was, intrinsically, the most 
important person present. She was not uncon- 
scious that this impression was in some degree 
manifested in the little sympathetic nod with 
which she acknowledged Mr. Wentworth's an- 
nouncement, " My cousin, Mr. Acton ! " 

"Your cousin not mine ? " said the Baroness. 

" It only depends upon you," Mr. Acton de- 
clared, laughing. 

The Baroness looked at him a moment, and 
noticed that he had very white teeth. " Let it 



   

depend upon your behavior," she said. " I think 
I had better wait. I have cousins enough. Un- 
less I can also claim relationship," she added, 
" with that charming young lady," and she pointed 
to the young girl at the window. 

"That's my sister," said Mr. Acton. And 
Gertrude Wentworth put her arm round the 
young girl and led her forward. It was not, ap- 
parently, that she needed much leading. She came 
toward the Baroness with a light, quick step, and 
with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking 
round its needles. She had dark blue eyes and 
dark brown hair; she was wonderfully pretty. 

Eugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other 
young women, and then held her off a little, look- 
ing at her. "Now this is quite another type" she 
said ; she pronounced the word in the French man- 
ner. " This is a different outline, my uncle, a dif- 
ferent character, from that of your own daughters. 
This, Felix," she went on, " is very much more 
what we have always thought of as the Amer- 
ican type." 

The young girl, during this exposition, was 
smiling askance at every one in turn, and at Felix 
out of turn. "I find only one type here ! " cried 
Felix, laughing. " The type adorable ! " 

This sally was received in perfect silence, but 
Felix, who learned all things quickly, had al- 



 

ready learned that the silences frequently ob- 
served among his new acquaintances were not 
necessarily restrictive or resentful. It was, as 
one might say, the silence of expectation, of 
modesty. They were all standing round his sister, 
as if they were expecting her to acquit herself of 
the exhibition of some peculiar faculty, some brill- 
iant talent. Their attitude seemed to imply that 
she was a kind of conversational mountebank, at- 
tired, intellectually, in gauze and spangles. This 
attitude gave a certain ironical force to Madame 
Minister's next words. " Now this is your circle," 
she said to her uncle. " This is your salon. These 
are your regular habitue's, eh ? I am so glad to 
see you all together." 

"Oh," said Mr. Wentworth, " they are always 
dropping in and out. You must do the same." 

" Father," interposed Charlotte Wentworth, 
" they must do something more." And she turned 
her sweet, serious face, that seemed at once timid 
and placid, upon their interesting visitor. " What 
is your name ? " she asked. 

" Eugenia-Camilla-Dolores," said the Baroness, 
smiling. " But you need n't say all that." 

" I will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You 
must come and stay with us." 

The Baroness laid her hand upon Charlotte's 
arm very tenderly ; but she reserved herself. She 



   

was wondering whether it would be possible to 
" stay " with these people. " It would be very 
charming very charming," she said ; and her eyes 
wandered over the company, over the room. She 
wished to gain time before committing herself. 
Her glance fell upon young Mr. Brand, who stood 
there, with his arms folded and his hand on his 
chin, looking at her. " The gentleman, I suppose, 
is a sort of ecclesiastic," she said to Mr. Went- 
worth, lowering her voice a little. 

" He is a minister," answered Mr. Wentworth. 

" A Protestant ? " asked Eugenia. 

" I am a Unitarian, madam," replied Mr. Brand, 
impressively. 

" Ah, I see," said Eugenia. " Something new." 
She had never heard of this form of worship. 

Mr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked 
anxiously at Mr. Brand. 

" You have come very far," said Mr. Went- 
worth. 

" Very far very far," the Baroness replied, 
with a graceful shake of her head a shake that 
might have meant many different things. 

" That 's a reason why you ought to settle down 
with us," said Mr. Wentworth, with that dryness 
of utterance which, as Eugenia was too intelligent 
not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his 
meaning. 



 

She looked at him, and for an instant, in his 
cold, still face, she seemed to see a far-away like- 
ness to the vaguely remembered image of her 
mother. Eugenia was a woman of sudden emo- 
tions, and now, unexpectedly, she felt one rising 
in her heart. She kept looking round the circle ; 
she knew that there was admiration in all the eyes 
that were fixed upon her. She smiled at them 
all. 

"I came to look to try to ask," she said. 
"It seems to me I have done well. I am very 
tired ; I want to rest." There were tears in her 
eyes. The luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil 
people, the simple, serious life the sense of these 
things pressed upon her with an overmastering 
force, and she felt herself yielding to one of the 
most genuine emotions she had ever known. " I 
should like to stay here," she said. " Pray take 
me in." 

Though she was smiling, there were tears in her 
voice as well as in her eyes. " My dear niece," 
said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put 
out her arms and drew the Baroness toward her ; 
while Robert Acton turned away, with his hands 
stealing into his pockets. 
 



IV. 

A FEW days after the Baroness Miinster had 
presented herself to her American kinsfolk she 
came, with her brother, and took up her abode in 
that small white house adjacent to Mr. Went- 
worth's own dwelling of which mention has al- 
ready been made. It was on going with his 
daughters to return her visit that Mr. Wentworth 
placed this comfortable cottage at her service ; the 
offer being the result of a domestic colloquy, dif- 
fused througli the ensuing twenty-four hours, in the 
course of which the two foreign visitors were dis- 
cussed and analyzed with a great deal of earnest- 
ness and subtlety. The discussion went forward, 
as I say, in the family circle ; but that circle on 
the evening following Madame Miinster's return 
to town, as on many other occasions, included 
Robert Acton and his pretty sister. If you had 
been present, it would probably not have seemed 
to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers 
was treated as an exhilarating occurrence, a pleas- 
ure the more in this tranquil household, a prospect- 
ive source of entertainment. This was not Mr. 



 

Wentworth'a way of treating any human occur- 
rence. The sudden irruption into the well-ordered 
consciousness of the Wentworths of an element 
not allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations 
required a readjustment of that sense of respon- 
sibility which constituted its principal furniture. 
To consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the 
light of the pleasure it might bring them was 
an intellectual exercise with which Felix Young's 
American cousins were almost wholly unacquainted, 
and which they scarcely supposed to be largely 
pursued in any section of human society. The 
arrival of Felix and his sister was a satisfaction, 
but it was a singularly joyless and inelastic satis- 
faction. It was an extension of duty, of the ex- 
ercise of the more recondite virtues ; but neither 
Mr. Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr. Brand, 
who, among these excellent people, was a great 
promoter of reflection and aspiration, frankly ad- 
verted to it as an extension of enjoyment. This 
function was ultimately assumed by Gertrude 
Wentworth, who was a peculiar girl, but the full 
compass of whose peculiarities had not been ex- 
hibited before they very ingeniously found their 
pretext in the presence of these possibly too agree- 
able foreigners. Gertrude, however, had to strug- 
gle with a great accumulation of obstructions, both 
of the subjective, as the metaphysicians say, and 



   

of the objective, order ; and indeed it is no small 
part of the purpose of this little history to set 
forth her struggle. What seemed paramount in 
this abrupt enlargement of Mr. Wentworth's sym- 
pathies and those of his daughters was an exten- 
sion of the field of possible mistakes ; and the 
doctrine, as it may almost be called, of the op- 
pressive gravity of mistakes was one of the most 
cherished traditions of the Wentworth family. 

" I don't believe she wants to come and stay in 
this house," said Gertrude; Madame Minister, 
from this time forward, receiving no other desig- 
nation than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and 
Gertrude acquired considerable facility in address- 
ing her, directly, as " Eugenia ; " but in speaking 
of her to each other they rarely called her any- 
thing but " she." 

" Does n't she think it good enough for her? " 
cried little Lizzie Acton, who was always asking 
unpractical questions that required, in strictness, 
no answer, and to which indeed she expected no 
other answer than such as she herself invariably 
furnished in a small, innocently-satirical laugh. 

" She certainly expressed a willingness to come," 
said Mr. Wentworth. 

" That was only politeness," Gertrude rejoined. 

" Yes, she is very polite very polite," said 
Mr. Wentworth. 



 

" She is too polite," his son declared, in a softly 
growling tone which was habitual to him, but 
which was an indication of nothing worse than a 
vaguely humorous intention. " It is very embar- 
rassing." 

" That is more than can be said of you, sir," 
said Lizzie Acton, with her Uttle laugh. 

" Well, I don't mean to encourage her," Clifford 
went on. 

" I 'm sure I don't care if you do ! " cried Liz- 
zie. 

" She will not think of you, Clifford," said Ger- 
trude, gravely. 

" I hope not ! " Clifford exclaimed. 

"She will think of Robert," Gertrude contin- 
ued, in the same tone. 

Robert Acton began to blush ; but there was 
no occasion for it, for every one was looking at 
Gertrude every one, at least, save Lizzie, who, 
with her pretty head on one side, contemplated 
her brother. 

" Why do you attribute motives, Gertrude ? " 
asked Mr. Wentworth. 

" I don't attribute motives, father," said Ger- 
trude. " I only say she will think of Robert ; and 
she will ! " 

" Gertrude judges by herself ! " Acton ex- 
claimed, laughing. " Don't you, Gertrude ? Of 



   

course the Baroness will think of me. She will 
think of me from morning till night." 

" She will be very comfortable here," said Char- 
lotte, with something of a housewife's pride. " She 
can have the large northeast room. And the 
French bedstead," Charlotte added, with a con- 
stant sense of the lady's foreignness. 

" She will not like it," said Gertrude ; " not 
even if you pin little tidies all over the chairs." 

" Why not, dear ? " asked Charlotte, perceiving 
a touch of irony here, but not resenting it. 

Gertrude had left her chair ; she was walking 
about the room ; her stiff silk dress, which she had 
put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound 
upon the carpet. "I don't know," she replied. 
" She will want something more more private." 

" If she wants to be private she can stay in her 
room," Lizzie Acton remarked. 

Gertrude paused in her walk, looking at her. 
" That would not be pleasant," she answered. 
" She wants privacy and pleasure together." 

Robert Acton began to laugh again. " My dear 
cousin, what a picture ! " 

Charlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her 
sister ; she wondered whence she had suddenly 
derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth 
also observed his younger daughter. 

" I don't know what her manner of life may 



 

have been," he said ; " but she certainly never 
can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious 
home." 

Gertrude stood there looking at them all. " She 
is the wife of a Prince," she said. 

" We are all princes here," said Mr. Went- 
worth ; " and I don't know of any palace in this 
neighborhood that is to let." 

" Cousin William," Robert Acton interposed, 
" do you want to do something handsome ? Make 
them a present, for three months, of the little 
house over the way." 

" You are very generous with other people's 
things ! " cried his sister. 

" Robert is very generous with his own things," 
Mr. Wentworth observed dispassionately, and 
looking, in cold meditation, at his kinsman. 

" Gertrude," Lizzie went on, " I had an idea 
you were so fond of your new cousin." 

" Which new cousin ? " asked Gertrude. 

" I don't mean the Baroness ! " the young girl 
rejoined, with her laugh. " I thought you ex- 
pected to see so much of him." 

" Of Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him," 
said Gertrude, simply. 

" Then why do you want to keep him out of 
the house ? " 

Gertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then 
looked away. 



   

" Should you want me to live in the house with 
you, Lizzie?" asked Clifford. 

" I hope you never will. I hate you! " Such 
was this young lady's reply. 

" Father," said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. 
Wentworth and smiling, with a smile the sweeter, 
as her smile always was, for its rarity ; " do let 
them live in the little house over the way. It will 
be lovely ! " 

Robert Acton had been watching her. " Ger- 
trude is right," he said. " Gertrude is the clever- 
est girl in the world. If I might take the liberty, 
I should strongly recommend their living there." 

" There is nothing there so pretty as the north- 
east room," Charlotte urged. 

" She will make it pretty. Leave her alone ! " 
Acton exclaimed. 

Gertrude, at his compliment, had blushed and 
looked at him : it was as if some one less familiar 
had complimented her. " I am sure she will make 
it pretty. ,It will be very interesting. It will be 
a place to go to. It will be a foreign house." 

" Are we very sure that we need a foreign 
house ? " Mr. Wentworth inquired. " Do you 
think it desirable to establish a foreign house in 
this quiet place ? " 

" You speak," said Acton, laughing, " as if it 
were a question of the poor Baroness opening a 
wine-shop or a gaming-table." 



 

" It would be too lovely ! " Gertrude declared 
again, laying her hand on the back of her father's 
chair. 

" That she should open a gaming-table ? " 
Charlotte asked, with great gravity. 

Gertrude looked at her a moment, and then, 
" Yes, Charlotte," she said, simply. 

" Gertrude is growing pert," Clifford Wentworth 
observed, with his humorous young growl. " That 
comes of associating with foreigners." 

Mr. Wentworth looked up at his daughter, who 
was standing beside him ; he drew her gently 
forward. " You must be careful," he said. " You 
must keep watch. Indeed, we must all be careful. 
This is a great change ; we are to be exposed to 
peculiar influences I don't say they are bad. I 
don't judge them in advance. But they may per- 
haps make it necessary that we should exercise a 
great deal of wisdom and self-control. It will be 
a different tone." 

Gertrude was silent a moment, in deference to 
her father's speech ; then, she spoke in a manner 
that was not in the least an answer to it. " I 
want to see how they will live. I am sure they 
will have different hours. She will do all kinds 
of little things differently. When we go over 
there it will be like going to Europe. She will 
have a boudoir. She will invite us to dinner 
very late. She will breakfast in her room." 



   

Charlotte gazed at her sister again. Gertrude's 
imagination seemed to her to be fairly running 
riot. She had always known that Gertrude had 
a great deal of imagination she had been very 
proud of it. But at the same time she had always 
felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible fac- 
ulty; and now, to her sense, for the moment, it 
seemed to threaten to make her sister a strange 
person who should come in suddenly, as from a 
journey, talking of the peculiar and possibly un- 
pleasant things she had observed. Charlotte's 
imagination took no journeys whatever ; she kept 
it, as it were, in her pocket, with the other furni- 
ture of this receptacle a thimble, a little box 
of peppermint, and a morsel of court-plaster. " I 
don't believe she would have any dinner or any 
breakfast," said Miss Wentworth. " I don't be- 
lieve she knows how to do anything herself. I 
should have to get her ever so many servants, and 
she would n't like them." 

" She has a maid," said Gertrude ; " a French 
maid. She mentioned her." 

" I wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap 
and red slippers," said Lizzie Acton. " There 
was a French maid in that play that Robert took 
me to see. She had pink stockings ; she was very 
wicked." 

" She was a soubrette" Gertrude announced, 



 

who had never seen a play in her life. " They 
call that a soubrette. It will be a great chance 
to learn French." Charlotte gave a little soft, 
helpless groan. She had a vision of a wicked, 
theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and red 
shoes, and speaking, with confounding volubility, 
an incomprehensible tongue, flitting through the 
sacred penetralia of that large, clean house. " That 
is one reason in favor of their coming here," Ger- 
trude went on. " But we can make Eugenia speak 
French to us, and Felix. I mean to begin the 
next time." 

Mr. Wentworth had kept her standing near 
him, and he gave her his earnest, thin, unrespon- 
sive glance again. " I want you to make me a 
promise, Gertrude," he said. 

" What is it? " she asked, smiling. 

" Not to get excited. Not to allow these 
these occurrences to be an occasion for excite- 
ment." 

She looked down at him a moment, and then 
she shook her head. " I don't think I can promise 
that, father. I am excited already." 

Mr. Wentworth was silent a while ; they all 
were silent, as if in recognition of something auda- 
cious and portentous. 

"I think they had better go to the other house," 
said Charlotte, quietly. 



   

" I shall keep them in the other house," Mr. 
Wentworth subjoined, more pregnantly. 

Gertrude turned away; then she looked across 
at Robert Acton. Her cousin Robert was a great 
friend of hers ; she often looked at him this way 
instead of saying things. Pier glance on this occa- 
sion, however, struck him as a substitute for a 
larger volume of diffident utterance than usual in- 
viting him to observe, among other things, the 
inefficiency of her father's design if design it 
was for diminishing, in the interest of quiet 
nerves, their occasions of contact with their for- 
eign relatives. But Acton immediately com- 
plimented Mr. Wentworth upon his liberality. 
" That 's a very nice thing to do," he said, " giv- 
ing them the little house. You will have treated 
them handsomely, and, whatever happens, you 
will be glad of it." Mr. Wentworth was liberal, 
and he knew he was liberal. It gave him pleas- 
ure to know it, to feel it, to see it recorded ; and 
this pleasure is the only palpable form of self- 
indulgence with which the narrator of these inci- 
dents will be able to charge him. 

" A three days' visit at most, over there, is all 
I should have found possible," Madame Munster 
remarked to her brother, after they had taken 
possession of the little white house. " It would 
have been too intime decidedly too intime. 



 

Breakfast, dinner, and tea en famille it would 
have been the end of the world if I could have 
reached the third day." And she made the same 
observation to her maid Augustine, an intelligent 
person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her confi- 
dence. Felix declared that he would willingly 
spend his life in the bosom of the Went worth 
family ; that they were the kindest, simplest, most 
amiable people in the world, and that he had 
taken a prodigious fancy to them all. The Bar- 
oness quite agreed with him that they were simple 
and kind ; they were thoroughly nice people, and 
she liked them extremely. The girls were per- 
fect ladies ; it was impossible to be more of a lady 
than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little 
village air. " But as for thinking them the best 
company in the world," said the Baroness, " that 
is another thing ; and as for wishing to live porte 
a porte with them, I should as soon think of wish- 
ing myself back in the convent again, to wear a 
bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory." And 
yet the Baroness was. in high good humor; she 
had been very much pleased. With her lively 
perception and her refined imagination, she was 
capable of enjoying anything that was character- 
istic, anything that was good of its kind. The 
Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect 
in its kind wonderfully peaceful and unspotted ; 



   

pervaded by a sort of dove-colored freshness that 
had all the quietude and benevolence of what she 
deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be 
founded upon a degree of material abundance for 
which, in certain matters of detail, one might have 
looked in vain at the frugal little court of Silber- 
stadt-Schrecken stein. She perceived immediately 
that her American relatives thought and talked 
very little about money ; and this of itself made an 
impression upon Eugenia's imagination. She per- 
ceived at the same time that if Charlotte or Ger- 
trude should ask their father for a very considerable 
sum he would at once place it in their hands ; and 
this made a still greater impression. The greatest 
impression of all, perhaps, was made by another 
rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate 
conviction that Robert Acton would put his hand 
into his pocket every day in the week if that 
rattle-pated little sister of his should bid him. 
The men in this country, said the Baroness, are 
evidently very obliging. Her declaration that she 
was looking for rest and retirement had been by 
no means wholly untrue ; nothing that the Bar- 
oness said was wholly untrue. It is but fair to 
add, perhaps, that nothing that she said was 
wholly true. She wrote to a friend in Germany 
that it was a return to nature ; it was like drink- 
ing new milk, and she was very fond of new 



 

milk. She said to herself, of course, that it would 
be a little dull ; but there can be no better proof 
of her good spirits than the fact that she thought 
she should not mind its being a little dull. It 
seemed to her, when from the piazza of her elee- 
mosynary cottage she looked out over the sound- 
less fields, the stony pastures, the clear-faced 
ponds, the rugged little orchards, that she had 
never been in the midst of so peculiarly intense a 
stillness ; it was almost a delicate sensual pleasure. 
It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and 
out of it something good must come. Augustine, 
indeed, who had an unbounded faith in her mis- 
tress's wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great 
deal perplexed and depressed. She was always 
ready to take her cue when she understood it ; 
but she liked to understand it, and on this occa- 
sion comprehension failed. What, indeed, was 
the Baroness doing dans cette galere ? what fish 
did she expect to land out of these very stagnant 
waters ? The game was evidently a deep one. 
Augustine could trust her ; but the sense of walk- 
ing in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy 
of this spare, sober, sallow, middle-aged person, 
who had nothing in common with Gertrude Went- 
worth's conception of a soubrette, by the most 
ironical scowl that had ever rested upon the un- 
pretending tokens of the peace and plenty of 



   

the Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could 
quench skepticism in action. She quite agreed 
with her mistress or rather she quite outstripped 
her mistress in thinking that the little white 
house was pitifully bare. " II faudra," said Au- 
gustine, " lui faire un peu de toilette." And she 
began to hang up portieres t in the doorways; to 
place wax candles, procured after some research, 
in unexpected situations ; to dispose anomalous 
draperies over the arms of sofas and the backs of 
chairs. The Baroness had brought with her to 
the New World a copious provision of the element 
of costume ; and the two Miss Wentworths, when 
they came over to see her, were somewhat bewild- 
ered by the obtrusive distribution of her ward- 
robe. There were India shawls suspended, cur- 
tain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics, 
corresponding to Gertrude's metaphysical vision 
of an opera-cloak, tumbled about in the sitting- 
places. There were pink silk blinds in the win- 
dows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed ; 
and along the chimney-piece was disposed a re- 
markable band of velvet, covered with coarse, 
dirty-looking lace. " I have been making myself 
a little comfortable," said the Baroness, much to 
the confusion of Charlotte, who had been on the 
point of proposing to come and help her put her 
superfluous draperies away. But what Charlotte 



 

mistook for an almost culpably delayed subsidence 
Gertrude very presently perceived to be the most 
ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic 
intention. "What is life, indeed, without cur- 
tains ? " she secretly asked herself ; and she ap- 
peared to herself to have been leading hitherto an 
existence singularly garish and totally devoid of 
festoons. 

Felix was not a young man who troubled him- 
self greatly about anything least of all about the 
conditions of enjoyment. His faculty of enjoy- 
ment was so large, so unconsciously eager, that it 
may be said of it that it had a permanent ad- 
vance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His sen- 
tient faculty was intrinsically joyous, and novelty 
and change were in themselves a delight to him. 
As they had come to him with a great deal of fre- 
quency, his life had been more agreeable than 
appeared. Never was a nature more perfectly 
fortunate. It was not a restless, apprehensive, 
ambitious spirit, running a race with the tyranny 
of fate, but a temper so unsuspicious as to put 
Adversity off her guard, dodging and evading her 
with the easy, natural motion of a wind-shifted 
flower. Felix extracted entertainment from all 
things, and all his faculties his imagination, his 
intelligence, his affections, his senses had a hand 
in the game. It seemed to him that Eugenia and 



   

he had been very well treated ; there was some- 
thing absolutely touching in that combination of 
paternal liberality and social considerateness which 
marked Mr. Wentworth's deportment. It was 
most uncommonly kind of him, for instance, to 
have given them a house. Felix was positively 
amused at having a house of his own ; for the lit- 
tle white cottage among the apple-trees the cha- 
let, as Madame Miinster always called it was 
much more sensibly his own than any domiciliary 
quatrieme, looking upon a court, with the rent 
overdue. Felix had spent a good deal of his life 
in looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly tat- 
tered pair of elbows resting upon the ledge of 
a high-perched window, and the thin smoke of 
a cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which 
street-cries died away and the vibration of chimes 
from ancient belfries became sensible. He had 
never known anything so infinitely rural as these 
New England fields ; and he took a great fancy to 
all their pastoral roughnesses. He had never had 
a greater sense of luxurious security ; and at the 
risk of making him seem a rather sordid advent- 
urer I must declare that he found an irresistible 
charm in the fact that he might dine every day 
at his uncle's. The charm was irresistible, how- 
ever, because his fancy flung a rosy light over this 
homely privilege. He appreciated highly the fare 



 

that was set before him. There was a kind of 
fresh-looking abundance about it which made him 
think that people must have lived so in the myth- 
ological era, when they spread their tables upon 
the grass, replenished them from cornucopias, and 
had no particular need of kitchen stoves. But the 
great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found 
a family sitting in the midst of gentle, generous 
people whom he might call by their first names. 
He had never known anything more charming 
than the attention they paid to what he said. It 
was like a large sheet of clean, fine-grained draw- 
ing-paper, all ready to be washed over with effect- 
ive splashes of water-color. He had never had 
any cousins, and he had never before found him- 
self in contact so unrestricted with young unmar- 
ried ladies. He was extremely fond of the society 
of ladies, and it was new to him that it might be 
enjoyed in just this manner. At first he hardly 
knew what to make of his state of mind. It 
seemed to him that he was in love, indiscrimi- 
nately, with three girls at once. He saw that 
Lizzie Acton was more brilliantly pretty than 
Charlotte and Gertrude ; but this was scarcely a 
superiority. His pleasure came from something 
they had in common a part of which was, in- 
deed, that physical delicacy which seemed to make 
it proper that they should always dress in thin 



   

materials and clear colors. But they were deli- 
cate in other ways, and it was most agreeable to 
him to feel that these latter delicacies were appre- 
ciable by contact, as it were. He had known, 
fortunately, many virtuous gentlewomen, but it 
now appeared to him that in his relations with 
them (especially when they were unmarried) he 
had been looking at pictures under glass. He per- 
ceived at present what a nuisance the glass had 
been how it perverted and interfered, how it 
caught the reflection of other objects and kept you 
walking from side to side. He had no need to ask 
himself whether Charlotte and Gertrude, and Liz- 
zie Acton, were in the right light ; they were al- 
ways in the right light. He liked everything 
about them : he was, for instance, not at all above 
liking the fact that they had very slender feet and 
high insteps. He liked their pretty noses; he 
liked their surprised eyes and their hesitating, not 
at all positive way of speaking ; he liked so much 
knowing that he was perfectly at liberty to be 
alone for hours, anywhere, with either of them; 
that preference for one to the other, as a compan- 
ion of solitude, remained a minor affair. Char- 
lotte Wentworth's sweetly severe features were as 
agreeable as Lizzie Acton's wonderfully express- 
ive blue eyes ; and Gertrude's air of being always 
ready to walk about and listen was as charming as 



 

anything else, especially as she walked very grace- 
fully. After a while Felix began to distinguish ; 
but even then he would often wish, suddenly, that 
they were not all so sad. Even Lizzie Acton, in 
spite of her fine little chatter and laughter, ap- 
peared sad. Even Clifford Wentworth, who had 
extreme youth in his favor, and kept a buggy with 
enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the 
prettiest legs in the world even this fortunate 
lad was apt to have an averted, uncomfortable 
glance, and to edge away from you at times, in 
the manner of a person with a bad conscience. 
The only person in the circle with no sense of op- 
pression of any kind was, to Felix's perception, 
Robert Acton. 

It might perhaps have been feared that after the 
completion of those graceful domiciliary embellish- 
ments which have been mentioned Madame Mun- 
ster would have found herself confronted with 
alarming possibilities of ennui. But as yet she 
had not taken the alarm. The Baroness was a 
restless soul, and she projected her restlessness, as 
it may be said, into any situation that lay before 
her. Up to a certain point her restlessness might 
be counted upon to entertain her. She was al- 
ways expecting something to happen, and, until it 
was disappointed, expectancy itself was a delicate 
pleasure. What the Baroness expected just now 



   

it would take some ingenuity to set forth ; it is 
enough that while she looked about her she found 
something to occupy her imagination. She as- 
sured herself that she was enchanted with her new 
relatives ; she professed to herself that, like her 
brother, she felt it a sacred satisfaction to have 
found a family. It is certain that she enjoyed to 
the utmost the gentleness of her kinsfolk's defer- 
ence. She had, first and last, received a great 
deal of admiration, and her experience of well- 
turned compliments was very considerable ; but 
she knew that she had never been so real a power, 
never counted for so much, as now when, for the 
first time, the standard of comparison of her little 
circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed, 
that the good people about her had, as regards her 
remarkable self, no standard of comparison at all 
gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power. It 
was true, as she said to herself, that if for this rea- 
son they would .be able to discover nothing against 
her, so they would perhaps neglect to perceive 
some of her superior points ; but she always wound 
up her reflections by declaring that she would take 
care of that. 

Charlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity 
between their desire to show all proper attention 
to Madame Miinster and their fear of being im- 
portunate. The little house in the orchard had 



 

hitherto been occupied during the summer months 
by intimate friends of the family, or by poor rela- 
tions who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord at- 
tentive to repairs and oblivious of quarter-day. 
Under these circumstances the open door of the 
small house and that of the large one, facing each 
other across their homely gardens, levied no tax 
upon hourly visits. But the Misses Wentworth 
received an impression that Eugenia was no friend 
to the primitive custom of " dropping in ; " she 
evidently had no idea of living without a door- 
keeper. " One goes into your house as into an 
inn except that there are no servants rushing 
forward," she said to Charlotte. And she added 
that that was very charming. Gertrude explained 
to her sister that she meant just the reverse ; she 
did n't like it at all. Charlotte inquired why she 
should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered 
that there was probably some very good reason for 
it which they should discover when they knew her 
better. " There can surely be no good reason for 
telling an untruth," said Charlotte. " I hope she 
does not think so." 

They had of course desired, from the first, to do 
everything in the way of helping her to arrange 
herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that there 
would be a great many things to talk about ; but 
the Baroness was apparently inclined to talk about 
nothing. 



   

" Write her a note, asking her leave to come 
and see her. I think that is what she will like," 
said Gertrude. 

" Why should I give her the trouble of answer- 
ing me?" Charlotte asked. "She will have to 
write a note and send it over." 

"I don't think she will take any trouble," said 
Gertrude, profoundly. 

" What then will she do ? " 

" That is what I am curious to see," said Ger- 
trude, leaving her sister with an impression that 
her curiosity was morbid.
