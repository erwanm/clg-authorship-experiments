an interest in but they finally settled around 
the babies and little children's hospital, and 
the Settlement House. In a way, she was 
fond of the sweet, helpless babies who seemed 
so very dependent on human kindness. If 
there was one of her own flesh and blood it 
would take possession of her very soul, all 
her thoughts, all her affection. But it should 
have been hers earlier in life. Now she wanted 
companionship. She could not wait for it to 
develop and then find unpleasant traits that 
had come from alien blood. No, she could 
not adopt a baby and wait a dozen years 
to know whether it would satisfy or not. 

She had helped two or three girls to better 
things. One through the last two years of 
High School and who was now teaching. And 
there had been one with a charming voice 
and an attractive face who had been injured 
in a mill and who would never have perfect 
use of her right hand. If she could be trained 
for a singer! 

She and Doctor Richards came to words 
about her. He said plainly she would not 
be worth the money spent upon her. But 



Miss Armitage insisted on spending it a year 
when the girl threw up her friend and joined 
a concert troupe, slipping presently into 
vaudeville where she was a success. 

And out of the dispute came a proffer of 
love and marriage. Alvah Richards had 
begun life at the opposite pole from Miss 
Armitage. There had been a fortune, a love 
for the study of medicine, a degree in Vienna 
and one at Paris. Then most of the fortune 
had been swept away. He returned to Amer- 
ica and some way drifted to Newton. They 
were just starting the hospital and he found 
plenty to do. He could live frugally. To 
help his still poorer fellow creatures in suf- 
fering, to restore them to strength and teach 
them to be useful members of society, or to 
comfort them and make the path easier over 
the river to the other country; this was his 
highest aim. 

Miss Armitage was almost dumb with sur- 
prise. She raised her hand in entreaty. 

"Oh, don’t! don’t,” she cried. ‘It is quite 
impossible; it cannot be. I like you very 
much, but I am not in love. And then ” 

'Then what?” with eager eyes and in- 
cisive voice. 





‘You had a birthday last week. I heard 
you telling it. You are thirty-one.'' 

'Well — ” There was a proud smile on his 
manly face. 

"And when my birthday comes, I shall be 
thirty-six. When you are sixty, rich in ex- 
perience, famous, a real man among men, I 
shall be quite an old woman. No, I shouldn’t 
do it for your sake.” 

"As if a few years made any difference! 
Why you could discount seven years at least. 
Have you been loved so much that you can 
throw away a man’s honest, honorable, tender 
love that will last all his life, that wear it 
as you like, in any stress, you can never wear 
out.” 

"Oh,” she cried. "You have spoiled a 
splendid friendship. I liked you so much, I
have no love to give in return.” 

"Then let us be friends again. I would 
rather have you for a friend than any other 
woman for a wife. I simply will not give you 
up.” 

So the pendulum went on swinging evenly 
between the two points, when Cinderella en- 
tered both lives. 



And now it was Sunday morning and the 
chimes were pealing — "Oh, come all ye faith- 
ful. Marilla listened with a throb of joy, 
though she did not know the words they were 
saying in sweetest melody. Miss Armitage 
came and stood by the cot with a cordial good 
morning. 

Marilla stretched out her hand and glanced 
up with an entreating sort of smile. 

''Was I very bad last night?'’ she asked in 
a wistful tone. 

''Bad? Why — what was it?'’ 

"I 've been thinking it over. Oh, I didn’t 
want to go back to Mrs. Borden. It is so 
lovely and quiet and beautiful here. But it 
is right. I am her bound-out girl, and I was 
glad to go there. You wouldn’t like me to be 
always looking for what was nice and pleasant 
and shirking other things, would you?” 

''Dear.” She stooped and kissed her. She 
had been going over some arguments fitted for 
a child’s understanding, and she was afraid 
of a rather painful time. And the worst to her 
was the fact that she had come to love the 
child and really desired her. 

'The babies, you know, are so fond of me, 





and they are all very good. So I wouldn’t have 
any reason for not staying with them. And 
it will be only five years more, then I shall be 
eighteen. And I thought — ” fiushing daintily, 
"that maybe Jane might marry, and you 
would want some one in her place and if 
it was — me,” rather tremulously — could 
come — I love you so. I’d be your Cinderella 
always. And when I go back it will be like 
the King’s ball — I shall keep thinking how 
lovely it was for you to bring me here instead 
of sending me to a hospital, and it will comfort 
me just as the music did.” 

Miss Armitage bent over and kissed her 
but there were tears in her eyes. She was 
touched with the child’s reasoning that was 
so like heroism. 

"Yes, dear,” she said. "We will think of 
it that way. And if you should be ill at any 
time, I will have you brought here, and you 
shall stop when you take the babies out and 
let me see them, and rest a little.” 

Oh that will be just lovely. You are so 
good,” and she kissed the white hand lying 
on her shoulder. 

Then Jane came in and she had her bath. 



How delightful it was to be rubbed so carefully, 
to have her curly mop brushed. 

ought to dress myself now. Why I'm 
not sick at all only I get tired easily, but I 
am stronger every day." 

The breakfast was so nice. And to be 
waited upon! Marilla gave an inward laugh 
of delight. 

And while Miss Armitage was at church. 
Dr. Richards came and bundled her up, car- 
ried her downstairs and deposited her in the 
buggy. He was very merry, somehow. He 
was going out in the country and, oh, how 
beautiful everything was! There had been a 
shower in the night and the air was full of 
fragrance from the grass, the pines and 
cedars, the orchards, wild flowers, and newly 
cut hay, that had not all been gathered in. 
Children ran about or swung in hammocks. 
Hens were fairly shouting with no regard 
for Sunday. Birds were caroling all sorts of 
joyous tunes and the tree twigs were gaily 
dancing. And here and there such beautiful 
drifts went over the sky, ships, she called them. 
They were going to fairy land — something 
that was not quite heaven, but a lovely place 




for all that. There must be so many lovely 
places in this great world! Over the ocean 
where Miss Armitage had been, and she re- 
called the castles and palaces and beautiful 
woods, and peasants dancing on the green 
and laughing; that she had seen in the port- 
folio of engravings. And the legends she 
had listened to! Oh, if she could go to school 
and learn ever so many things now, for when 
she was eighteen she would be too old, and 
a kind of perplexity settled in her smooth 
forehead. 



Dr. Richards had been studying the changes 
in the child's face. It was like reading a book, 
but it had many variations. Her thoughts 
must have traveled far and wide. What were 
they? 

"Are you very happy?” he asked. 

"Happy?” she echoed, wonderingly. "Why 
it is a beautiful Sunday. One ought to be 
happy — here with you and watching all these 
lovely things.” 

"Are Sundays happier than any other 
days?” 

"Well — ” slowly. "They ought to be. 
It seems as if it was the day of the Sun, and 
that’s always glad and merry.” 

"But when it rains or is cloudy?” 

'Oh, you know it is there, and maybe He 
is fighting away the clouds. And He draws 
up the water. I read that in a book — and 
when He gets enough He lets it fall down as He 


did last night and that makes the world so fresh 
and sweet. And there are fifty-two Sundays 

when you ought not 

What?’’ watching the shadow in her eyes. 

"Well, I think you ought not work very 
much. I suppose some people have to when 
you have meals to get and babies to see to. 
I go to Sunday school with Jack and I like 
it so much. I’ve learned ever so many of 
the songs. But the lessons puzzle me. They 
are about God — we had them in the Home, you 
know, and God seems so big and strange. Do 
you know all about him.” 

'No, child, and no one, not even ministers 
can know all, so you need not worry about 
that. God has the whole world in His 
keeping. Don’t you like the week days?” 

''Well, they don’t seem to have the same 
joy in them, only at Miss Armitage’s every 
day seems like Sunday. But I keep counting 
them. You see. I’ll be thirteen in September. 
Then when we’ve had fifty-two Sundays I’ll 
be fourteen and so on, until I am eighteen.” 

"And then?” in a sweet kind of tone. 

“Why I won’t be bound-out any more. It’s 
right for me to stay, she said so, but it would 



seem such a long while if I was just counting 
the years. And Sunday comes so quick, 
most times, and then you can be glad.’
What a touch of philosophy for a child! 
''But — they are good to you at Bordens?’
"Oh, yes. I love Bridget, though I was 
afraid of her at first. But the grown people 
have each other and since I don’t really 
belong to them — oh, I can’t explain it,” 
and the knot came back to her brow. 
"You see when you’re bound-out and going 
away for a while they can’t feel the same 
to you. They’re never real cross and they 
don’t whip you as they did at the Home, and 
you have nicer things to eat. Sometimes 
when you were awful hungry you didn’t 
seem to get enough. You wanted one more 
piece of bread, but you couldn’t have it. 
Oh, I like it so much better at Mrs. Borden’s 
Only Jack — Are boys always bad?” 

"I guess they are for the most part,” 
laughing. 

"But he will go to school again. And his 
father says he will outgrow it. His father 
truly does want him to be good, and he said 
I must tell when he pinched me or kicked me, 





and he would punish him. But I don’t like 
to, always, for he denies it, and his mother 
isn’t pleased when I do. You can feel when 
people do not like you to tell things. At 
the Home when you told tales they whipped 
the child that was bad, and then they whipped 
you for telling tales. It didn’t seem as if 
that was quite fair, so I tried never to tell 
on anyone.” 

"Generally speaking, it is a bad habit,” 
he commented, gravely. 

Then they had reached their destination. 
A poor old paralyzed man sat in a wheeling 
chair on the porch. Medical skill could not 
do much for him, but friendship and interest 
made pleasant times to remember when the 
hours were long and weary. Dr. Richards 
had brought some illustrated magazines, and 
they talked over the happenings of the week. 

A sweet-faced, rather elderly lady brought 
Marilla a rocking chair, and asked her if she 
was the doctor’s patient. Then she offered 
her a piece of cake and a lovely pear, and after- 
ward took her down to see the flower garden 
that was fairly rioting in beauty, and a flock 
of snowy white chickens, as well as some fine 


pigeons that circled around like swallows. 
She was the wife, and there was a daughter 
who had gone to church. She talked of Dr. 
Richards, how good and comforting he was 
to father.’’ Marilla thought he must be 
good to everybody. 

"I 've had a lovely time with you,’’ the child 
said. Then she shook hands with 'father,” 
who said — 

s’pose you’re the doctor’s little girl?” 
His mind was not always clear on some points. 
"Come again, won’t you?” 

She smiled and nodded. "The doctor’s 
little girl,” how sweet it sounded! But of 
course that could not be. 

They had a delightful ride home though it 
was growing warmer. How beautiful her 
eyes were today — a sort of gray-violet, and 
the bronze lashes almost curled. And as he 
listened to her soft, flowing voice, he kept 
thinking — if he was to marry some one and 
have a little girl full of quaint ideas as this 
one was! But it would take a long, long 
while, and he sighed. 

Miss Armitage was sitting by the parlor 
window when they returned, and she came to 
the door to meet them. 




ran away with your little invalid,' 
the doctor exclaimed. "Haven’t I brought her 
back improved?” 

Her cheeks were positively rosy and were 
rounded out by the exquisite shading. She 
clasped her small arms around Miss Armitage. 

"And I 've had the most splendid time! A 
real Sunday. WeVe been out in the beautiful 
country where birds were singing hymns and 
I'm just full of happiness.” 

They had kept their pact, these two people 5 
they could not have worked together other- 
wise, and each one was following the same 
path, for the good of the poor of this world, 
am very glad ” 

"Then you are not going to scold me?” with 
a questioning smile. “I promised her a 
drive you know, and today was rather a 
holiday to me.” 

"Why, she doesn't scold,” cried Marilla 
in a sort of joyful contradiction. 

“Won't you come in and have some dinner 
with us?” 

'Tete would grumble if he stood here an 
hour. Now, if you would change it to supper — 
and a cup of tea ” 



"Let be a cup of tea, then. I want to talk 
over some plans. 

"Very well. Expect me on the mark. Six, 
isn’t it?” 

"Yes,” with a smile. 

"Oh, I’m just delighted,” and Manila 
squeezed his hand. 

"So you had a lovely time. Where did 
you go?” 

"Oh — through the park and then out on 
such a beautiful road. Things seem nicer 
on Sunday, because there isn’t so much noise. 
And there was an old man who has to get 
about in a chair with little wheels, and can’t 
walk any more. And the lady gave me some 
cake and such a luscious pear, and asked me to 
come again. I just wished that there was 
some little girl from the Home living there.” 

Manila had her face and hands washed, 
and a fresh white frock put on. She was so 
bright and chatty and really charming. But 
after dinner she lay in the Morris chair and 
Miss Armitage read her to sleep. It seemed 
as if she had improved so much in the 
twenty-four hours. 

They had such a genial and charming 




supper, and Miss Armitage played on the 
organ afterward and then talked about the 
girls who were going to the Rest House next 
week. Five of them were very much worn 
out. They would need to stay a full fortnight. 

"And I think one of them needs some medi- 
cal attention. Come to the Settlement and 
see her before she starts. And you know 
I am booked for that Canadian journey with 
the Winslows. I am almost sorry I promised. 
Do you think it would be safe to let the 
child go to the Bordens on Saturday?'' 

'You won't let her go back! She’s is 
worth something better than baby tending.” 

'You shouldn’t have cured her up so soon! 
I don’t exactly see my way clear or I should 
keep her for good and all. I like her very 
much. You may laugh at me about my 
swans being ordinary geese — but we must 
admit the Bordens have the right to her at 
present. And I do not want to make bad 
friends with them, seeing that in law he may 
exact the pound of flesh. They may tire of 
her or she may not be able to stand the babies 
and Jack. I could leave her here with Jane 
or send her to the Home. But she is very 



much resigned to the return. She has a 
curious bit of conscience about it. So it is 
best to let her try again. 

can’t bear the thought of it.” He 
uttered it with vehemence. 

don’t like it much myself. But it 
seems the only way at present. Bridget will 
looks out for her. We can’t accuse them of 
any cruelty or neglect.” 

"And she fairly worships you — fairy god- 
mother.” 

wish I were. I should change the lot of 
more than one Cinderella. Well — we will 
wait and see.” 

Manila came in with a bunch of flowers. 

"Jane said I might pick them for the 
doctor, and the ride was so nice. I shall 
put it in among the splendid things of my 
life — like the dream, and coming here — and 
when I get settled in bed and all is dark I 
can make a real fairy land out of it.” 

He took her flowers and kissed her, and 
said "Good-night” to them in a low tone. 
But he went home racking his brains to see 
if something could not be done toward keeping 
her. 




Bridget came around one afternoon and 
was enthusiastic over her improvement. 

"They're doing pretty well and I believe 
the twins are not to get any more teeth in a 
year or two. And the boss says theyVe 
thinned out astonishing, and they can talk 
a good bit. And that girFs going to the other 
place and they say you just must come down. 
But not a foot should you stir if you wasn't 
real well. An’ its glad enough I am to have 
himself at breakfast at the morn and dinner 
at night. It’s like living again, but I don’t 
want to see any more twins.” 

Marilla laughed. "Yes, I feel all well only 
sometimes I have a little catch in my breath; 
and I’ll be ready to go on Saturday.” 

"An’ I’ll just be praying to the saints to 
send you back safe and sound. I don’t see 
why people should be kitin’ off to strange 
places, when they’ve a good, comfortable 
house to stay in. But the saints be praised 
for the rest with that imp of a Jack being 
away! They do be grown up after awhile 
an’ I s’pose you couldn’t have men if there 
were no boy babies.” 

Then Mr. Borden called late one afternoon 



and brought a note from his wife. Ellen had 
to leave on Saturday or lose the nice place, 
and the babies were well now, walking all 
round and beginning to say cunning words. 
Pansy called "Illa, Illa," and then looked 
around for Manila to come, and said — 'Tapa 
bing llla.’ They wanted her so much. All 
their meals were taken over in the next cot- 
tage, and the laundress came twice a week for 
the washings. The children were out of 
doors most of the time, and they were on the 
ground floor, so there was no going up and 
down stairs. Marilla would have it very 
easy and they would take the best of care of 
her. 

Mr. Borden was both kind and gentlemanly. 
He hoped there would be some way in which 
they could repay Miss Armitage for all 
her care. Would she accept a contribution for 
the Babies' Hospital, he had heard she was 
interested in, or any other charity?’

It was very nice of him, Miss Armitage 
thought, and she chose the hospital. Marilla 
had been out walking with Jane and when she 
came in Mr. Borden was so cordial that it 
won the child's heart, and she was the more 




willing to go because she should lose her dear 
Miss Armitage for a month. 

"And afterward, you must come and see 
me and we will have nice times together, and 
I may teach you a little music — 'you learn so 
easily. Oh, I count on seeing a good deal of 
you.” 

The parting was not as bitter as Miss 
Armitage had feared, partly because Mr. Bor- 
den was there and in such good spirits, and 
Marilla was thinking that the month would 
soon pass and that in any event she could 
not see her dear fairy godmother in that 
time. 

The journey interested her very much. 
She had never taken so long a ride in the cars. 
Mr. Borden bought her a box of marshmallows 
and he had some illustrated papers. And 
there at the station was Miss Florence who 
gave her a cordial welcome, and the big 
surrey drove them and three other passengers 
to their destination. Mrs. Borden ran down 
the path to meet them. 

Ve been on pins and needles lest something 
should happen,” she began. "Why, Marilla, 
you don't look as if you had ever been ill! 



And we're so glad to get you back. Oh, you 
don’t know what an awful time I had, and 
at first the babies wouldn’t let Ellen touch 
them. Flo or I had to feed them. I’m clear 
worn out now, but I do hope the babies 
haven’t forgotten you, for I want a little 
rest. It seemed too bad that you should have 
given out just then. And I do believe you’ve 
grown taller. Why, you are quite a big girl.” 

The twins sat on a blanket on the grassy 
space at the side of the house. Mrs. Borden 
led the girl out to them with a glad sound 
in her voice. 

"Here’s your dear Ilia come,” she said. 
"Dear Ilia that you’ve wanted so much.” 

Pansy looked up. Marilla gave one spring 
and knelt down beside them. It was nice to 
be longed for, to be remembered. She had 
really loved them. Her heart was always 
reaching out for something to love. 

'Tlla, Ilia,” almost shouted Pansy and went 
down head first in Marilla ’s lap. 

"Oh, you darling!” 

'I’m glad you didn’t get weaned away, 
Marilla. I was afraid you would, having 
such a fuss made over you. Mr. Borden said 




the house was fine. That Miss Armitage must 
be rich. Well — she was very good to you 
and did the best she could for us. But that 
Ellen didn't like children, that was the long 
and the short of it, and she has just the place 
for her, and eighteen dollars a month. Yes, 
Violet, this is our own Manila come back to 
us, and we shall never let her go away again. 

Violet had looked rather wary and been 
chewing on the end of her thumb, but now 
she nodded and began to hitch toward Ma- 
rilla. 

"Now weTe going over to the cottage to 
dinner. It's such a pleasure to go together. 
I always take Jack. He has nice table man- 
ners if he isn't an angel otherwise. Oh, there 
he is! Jack, here’s Marilla!” 

Jack gave a sort of wild howl of delight and 
started on a run with outstretched arms. 
Over went Marilla and Pansy and Jack on 

the top of the heap. Pansy gave a smothered 
scream. 

Mrs. Borden caught Jack by the shoulder 
and dragged him up. ''You bad, bad boy!'’ 
she exclaimed, angrily. 

"Hello! what’s the row?” asked Mr. Borden, 
advancing to the fray. 


Jack rubbed his eyes to make some tears. 

' Well, you said you was glad to see her an' so 
was I. An' I was jest gone' to hug her an' 
the bug fell over, an' I couldn't help it." 

Mr. Borden laughed. Mrs. Borden picked 
up Pansy and comforted her. But she did 
howl as if she had been half killed. 

"Jack, go to Aunt Florence and be made 
ready for dinner," in a commanding tone. 
"Oh dear, it does seem " 

'Well things will go better now," said 
Mr. Borden soothingly. "Marilla, you are 
going to be the salvation of the household. 
Did the twins really know her?" 

'Tansy did, I think Pansy's really smarter 
that Violet, I do hope we'll have a little com- 
fort now. There Pansy, dear, go to your 
sweet Marilla," and she stood the child 
down. ‘‘We must hurry or we will be late 
for dinner." 

Marilla saw the four go over to the cottage, 
as it was called. She had been tired out 
with the railroad journey, entertaining as 
it was, then the excitement of meeting them 
all again, the bump on her forehead when 
she had come down so hard on Pansy's head, 




and the screams that seemed like a stab going 
from temple to temple tired her inexpressibly. 
Then, too, she was hungry. Oh, if she could 
have a glass of hot milk such as Jane used to 
bring her! She really could not help crying a 
little. Both babies stood up by her. Violet 
pounding on one shoulder. Pansy making a 
grab at her hair that seemed to pull it out by 
the roots. 

'Titty, pitty!' she said gleefully. 

"Oh, Pansy dear, you hurt. She dis- 
entangled the one hand, but the other made 
the same clutch and was more difficult to 
manage. Then she rose to her knees that her 
head might be out of reach. Violet came down 
heavily and began to cry. Poor Marilla 
hardly knew what to do. 

The babies were much thinner and their 
faces not so pudgy, but Marilla thought they 
still resembled the Campbell soup little girl 
and laughed in spite of her own hurts. Then 
Violet spied a green apple and made a bee 
line for it. 

"She can't bite it,’ thought Marilla, and 
as it kept rolling it amused the baby. Then 
Pansy crept toward it and there was a rather 



funny time. Violet slapped her twin in the 
face and there was another howl and Marilla 
went to the rescue. Oh, what should she 
do? Everything was so strange! 

"Bed bed’y mik,'' demanded Pansy, 
"Bed milk.’’ 

"Let us go and find some,” and she raised 

the baby to her feet, taking her by the hand. 
They walked up on the porch, and she placed 
her in the carriage while she glanced at Violet. 
Not a moment too soon — the little sharp 
teeth were making inroads on the apple. She 
ran and snatched it, throwing it out of sight. 
There was another howl. Mrs. Borden came 
hurrying down. 

'What is the matter?” rather crossly. 
Violet found an apple and bit in it; I threw 
it away.” 

"Oh, that was right Marilla,” in a mollified 
tone. "VTiere’s Pansy?” 

"On the porch, in the carriage. I think 
she’s hungry. It sounded as if she meant 
bread and milk.” 

"Yes. They have that for their supper. 
I guess I can start it. I used to feed them 




first. Let me see. I guess I can show you — 
you’re so handy unless they’ve spoiled you.” 

She had Violet in her arms and said — 
"Bring in Pansy,” leading the way to a room 
that seemed a general storage place. She 
lighted the little pyro stove, opened a closet 
and took out a saucepan, a bottle of milk, a 
sugar dish and some spoons. 

‘‘Now as soon as it gets warm, you fix it — 
you cannot have forgotten how, and then turn 
this screw and put the light out. For 
heaven’s sake don’t set anything afire! Oh, 
there’s no place like your own home. I 
haven’t had an hour’s comfort since I came 
down here. And my dinner’s getting cold. 
Nice baked veal it was, with dressing. There 
babies, Manila will give you some nice bread 
and milk.” 

She ran off. The babies whined a little and 
then watched the proceedings. The stove 
stood up on a table and she poured out part 
of the milk. Then she gave the babies a 
crust of bread to stop their clamoring while 
she crumbed up some in the saucepan and 
kept stirring it so that it shouldn’t scorch, 
taking out part, presently. Pansy climbed 



up by a chair and began to call ''BedV mik, 

bedV milk.’ 

Marilla put on her bib and began to feed 
her. Then Violet joined with her starvation 
cry. First it \vas one open pink mouth then 
the other. The viands disappeared as if by 
magic. She meant to have a little for her- 
self — she was so weak and gone in the stomach, 
but she found she must make some more, even, 
for the babies. So she crumbed up the re- 
mainder of the loaf. How they did eat! 
She was very tired of ladling it in each little 
mouth. 

She had a very little left for herself, but 
it seemed to help the desperately tired feeling. 
She had put the stove out without any mis- 
hap. Pansy began to cry — 'Wock, wock.” 

'What is it dear? Was it anything more 
to eat?” She glanced through the closet. 

"Wock, wock,” hanging to her skirt. 

"Me wock,” joined in the chorus that might 
be Chinese, 

Oh, would they never come! She took the 
babies out on the porch. There was a big 
rocker. Pansy ran to it and patted it, 
rolling up her eyes. 




yes, Rock. I might have guessed, but 
my head feels so tired and queer. Then she 
took the cushions and blankets out of the 
carriage and lifted up Violet, settling her in 
one side. But Pansy would have none of it. 
She squirmed down on the floor and began 
to cry. 

"Oh, I don't know what you want!’’ 
Marilla almost fell into the chair and jogged 
it gently. Violet was going to sleep. Poor 
Cinderalla wiped the tears that would have 
run down her cheeks. She was so tired. 
Even the babies crying did not move her. 
But when she heard the voices she sprang up. 

"Oh, what is the matter?” asked Mrs. 
Borden. 

‘They wanted to be rocked,” explained 
Marilla and I put them both in the chair, 
but Pansy wouldn’t stay ” 

“We have spoiled them. Ellen used to sit 
in the chair and hold them both. That 
seemed about the only thing she could do that 
would please them. And I’ve held one in the 
right and Aunt Florence the other until my 
back ached and I was fit to fall to pieces. We’ve 
had the most awful time, Flo and I. But I 



remember I had a dreadful time cutting 
my wisdom teeth, and I was grown. I used 
to walk the floor at night, they would swell 
up so. We can't blame the poor babies. 
And they missed you so. They used to be so 
good, wasn't they M’rilla; and I suppose 
they’ll be good again. They must be un- 
dressed and put to bed. Flo, you look after 
Violet, and M’rilla you run over and get 
some dinner. You must be most starved.” 

Mrs. Borden had picked up Pansy who had 
now turned to her comforting thumb. 

"Oh, run over. You needn’t be afraid. 
Ellen liked the girls first rate. Here, Mr. 
Borden will escort you.” 

expect you’re tired out and homesick,” 
he said sympathetically. "But we will have 
things better tomorrow. And we are all 
so glad to have you — this way. Here, Katie, 
give this little girl a good dinner. She de- 
serves the best you have.” 

They were clearing the dining room. One 
long table was piled up with the used dishes. 
At the other, covered with rather worn en- 
ameled cloth, sat two women and one young 
man. Kate made a place for the child and 




brought her a plate with most everything 
piled on it. Bridget, at home, was so much 
neater, but then she didn’t have so many 
hungry people to feed. And Jane with her 
dainty ways! 

Oh, she was just a little bound-out nurse 
girl. She had danced and feasted with the 
prince; she had been in the palace with the 
fairy godmother where she was waited on 
as if she were a little lady. And there had been 
the Sunday ride with Dr. Richards. Was it 
all dreams? 

She could not eat. The food was mostly 
cold. There was a big lump in her throat and 
a heaviness in her heart. How long and 
dreary the five years looked! 

'I’m not hungry,” and she pushed the 
plate away. 

"But you’ll have some pudding and some 
cream. I told you, Maggie, they’d stuff their- 
selves on that there puddin’ ! You can beat 
the band on that.” 

'I'll just have the cream,” the little girl 
said, timidly. 

'Well you won’t last long to take care of 
themx there babies if you can’t eat better’n 


that!’ said Katie. never see such squabs 
in my life!’

Katie, that won't do. They he 
'Kate Greenaway’ children. Was she some 
one who fatted up young ones? Well, she’d 
better let ’em alone to my thinkin’. And their 
great round eyes! And the crossest things I 
ever did see! Mrs. Munson thought she’d 
have to give up t’other side of the house.” 

"Be careful,” cautioned Maggie, with a 
slight turn of the head. 

Manila ate her cream, and it really tasted 
good. Then she rose and said good-night in a 
quiet fashion. 

"Katie, you must remember about little 
pitchers,” cautioned some one. 

'Well — that’s a nice little girl and I don’t 
believe she’d carry tales. Ellen said she 
wouldn’t take care of those babies for ten 
dollars a week. And what’s this child ever 
going to do ” 

"Mr. Borden is a nice kind of a man and 
when he’s around that Jack behaves like a 
little gentleman, and the ladies do very well; 
they’re pleasant and don’t put on airs. But
