" Ah, that s a question she would never ask ! " 
cried the young man, passing out. 



VI. 



THE next morning he found himself sitting on 
one of the red satin sofas beside Mr. Dosson, in 
this gentleman s private room at the Hotel de 
I llnivers et de Cheltenham. Delia and Francie 
had established their father in the old quarters ; 
they expected to spend the winter in Paris but 
they had not taken independent apartments, for 
they had an idea that when you lived that way it 
was grand but lonely you didn 't meet people on 
the staircase. The temperature was now such as 
to deprive the good gentleman of his usual resource of sitting in the court, and he had not yet 
discovered an effective substitute for this recrea 
tion. Without Mr. Flack, at the cafes, he felt too 
much like a non-consumer. But he was patient 
and ruminant ; Gaston Probert grew to like him 
and tried to invent amusements for him ; took him 
to see the great markets, the sewers and the Bank 
of France, and put him in the way of acquiring 
a beautiful pair of horses (it is perhaps not superfluous to say that tins was a perfectly straight 
proceeding on the young man s part), which Mr. 
Dosson, little as he resembled a sporting character, 
found it a welcome pastime on fine afternoons to 
drive, with a highly scientific hand, from a smart 
Americaine, in the Bois de Boulogne. There was 
a reading-room at the banker s, where he spent 
hours engaged in a manner best known to himself, 
and he shared the great interest, the constant topic 
of his daughters the portrait that was going 
forward in the Avenue de Villiers. This was the 
subject round which the thoughts of these young 
ladies clustered and their activity revolved ; it 
gave a large scope to their faculty for endless repetition, for monotonous insistence, for vague and 
aimless discussion. On leaving Mme. de Brecourt 
Francie s lover had written to Delia that he de 
sired half an hour s private conversation with her 
father on the morrow at half-past eleven ; his im 
patience forbade him to wait for a more canonical 
hour. He asked her to be so good as to arrange 
that Mr. Dosson should be there to receive him 
and to keep Francie out of the way. Delia ac 
quitted herself to the letter. 

" Well, sir, what have you got to show ? " asked 
Francie s father, leaning far back on the sofa and 
moving nothing but his head, and that very little, 
toward his interlocutor. Probert was placed side- 
wise, a hand on each knee, almost facing him, 
on the edge of the seat. 







" To show, sir what do you mean ? " 

" What do you do for a living ? How do you 
subsist ? " 

" Oh, comfortably enough. Of course it would 
be criminal in you not to satisfy yourself on that 
point. My income is derived from three sources. 
First, some property left me by my dear mother. 
Second, a legacy from my poor brother, who had 
inherited a small fortune from an old relation of 
ours who took a great fancy to him (he went to 
America to see her), and which he divided among 
the four of us in the will he made at the time of 
the war." 

" The war what war ? " asked Mr. Dosson. 

" Why the Franco-German " 

" Oh, that old war ! " And Mr. Dosson almost 
laughed. " Well ? " he softly continued. 

" Then my father is so good as to make me a 
little allowance ; and some day I shall have more 
from him." 

Mr. Dosson was silent a moment ; then he 
observed, " Why, you seem to have fixed it so you 
live mostly on other folks." 

" I shall never attempt to live on you, sir ! " 
This was spoken with some vivacity by our young 
man ; he felt the next moment that he had said 
something that might provoke a retort. But his 
companion only rejoined, mildly, impersonally : 

"Well, I guess there won 't be any trouble about 
that. And what does my daughter say ? " 





" I haven 't spoken to her yet." 

" Haven 't spoken to her ? " 

"I thought it more orthodox to break ground 
with you first." 

" Well, when I was after Mrs. Dosson I guess I 
spoke to her quick enough," Francie s father said, 
humorously. There was an element of reproach 
in this and Gaston Probert was mystified, for the 
inquiry about his means a moment before had 
been in the nature of a challenge. " How will you 
feel if she won 't have you, after you have exposed 
yourself this way to me ? " the old gentleman 
went on. 

" Well, I have a sort of confidence. It may be 
vain, but God grant not ! I think she likes me 
personally, but what I am afraid of is that she 
may consider that she knows too little about me. 
She has never seen my people she doesn 't know 
what may be before her." 

" Do you mean your family the folks at home ? " 
said Mr. Dosson. " Don 't you believe that. Delia 
has moused around she has found out. Delia s 
thorough ! " 

" Well, we are very simple, kindly, respectable 
people, as you will see in a day or two for your 
self. My father and sisters will do themselves the 
honour to wait upon you," the young man de 
clared, with a temerity the sense of which made 
his voice tremble. 

" We shall be very happy to see them, sir," Mr. 





Dosson returned, cheerfully. " Well now, let s 
see," he added, musing sociably. "Don 't you 
expect to embrace any regular occupation ? " 

Probert looked at him, smiling. " Have you 
anything of that sort, sir ? " 

" Well, you have me there ! " Mr. Dosson ad 
mitted, with a comprehensive sigh. " It doesn 't 
seem as if I required anything, I'm looked after 
so well. The fact is the girls support me." 

" I shall not expect Miss Francie to support 
me," said Gaston Probert. 

"You're prepared to enable her to live in the 
style to which she s accustomed ? " And Mr. 
Dosson turned a speculative eye upon him. 

" Well, I don 't think she will miss anything, 
That is, if she does she will find other things 
instead." 

" I presume she 'll miss Delia, and even me, a 
little." 

" Oh, it s easy to prevent that," said Gaston 
Probert. 

" Well, of course we shall be on hand. Con 
tinue to reside in Paris ? " Mr. Dosson went on. 

" I will live anywhere in the world she likes. 
Of course my people are here that s a great tie. 
I am not without hope that it may with time 
become a reason for your daughter." 

" Oh, any reason 'll do where Paris is concerned. 
Take some lunch ? " Mr. Dosson added, looking at 
his watch. 



They rose to their feet, but before they had 
gone many steps (the meals of this amiable family 
were now served in an adjoining room), the young 
man stopped his companion. " I can 't tell you 
how kind I think it the way you treat me, and 
how I am touched by your confidence. You take 
me just as I am, with no recommendation beyond 
my own word." 

"Well, Mr. Probert, if we didn 't like you we 
wouldn 't smile on you. Recommendations in that 
case wouldn 't be any good. And since we do like 
you there ain 't any call for them either. I trust 
my daughters ; if I didn 't I'd have stayed at home. 
And if I trust them, and they trust you, it s the 
same as if  trusted you, ain 't it ? " 

" I guess it is ! " said Gaston, smiling. 

His companion laid his hand on the door but 
he paused a moment. " Now are you very sure ? " 

" I thought I was, but you make me nervous." 

" Because there was a gentleman here last year 
I'd have put my money on him" 

" A gentleman last year ? " 

" Mr. Flack. You met him surely. A very fine 
man. I thought she favoured him." 

" Seigneur Lieu ! " Gaston Probert murmured, 
under his breath. 

Mr. Dosson had opened the door, he made his 
companion pass into the little dining-room, where 
the table was spread for the noon-day breakfast. 
"Where are the chickens?" he inquired, disap- 







pointedly. Gaston thought at first that he missed 
a dish from the board, but he recognised the next 
moment the old man s usual designation of his 
daughters. These young ladies presently came in, 
but Francie looked away from Mr. Probert. The 
suggestion just dropped by her father had given 
him a shock (the idea of the girl s " favouring " the 
newspaper-man was inconceivable), but the charm 
ing way she avoided his eye convinced him that 
he had nothing to fear from Mr. Flack. 

That night (it had been an exciting day), Delia 
remarked to her sister that of course she could 
draw back : upon which Francie repeated the 
expression, interrogatively, not understanding it. 
" You can send him a note, saying you wont," 
Delia explained. 

" Won 't marry him ? " 

" Gracious, no ! Won 't go to see his sister. You 
can tell him it s her place to come to see you 
first." 

" Oh, I don 't care," said Francie, wearily. 

Delia looked at her a moment very gravely. " Is 
that the way you answered him when he asked 
you ? " 

"I'm sure I don 't know. He could tell you 
best." 

" If you were to speak to me that way I should 
have said, Oh, well, if you don 't want it any more 
than that ! 

" Well, I wish it was you," said Francie. 





" That Mr. Probert was me ? " 

"No; that you were the one he liked." 

Francie Dosson, are you thinking of Mr. 
Flack ? " her sister broke out, suddenly. 

" No, not much." 

" Well then, what s the matter ? " 

" You have ideas and opinions ; you know whose 
place it is and what s due and what isn t. You 
could meet them all." 

" Why, how can you say, when that s just what 
I'm trying to find out ! " 

" It doesn 't matter any way ; it will never come 
off," said Francie. 

" What do you mean by that ? " 

" He 'll give me up in a few weeks. I shall do 
something." 

" If you say that again I shall think you do it on 
purpose ! " Delia declared. " Are you thinking of 
George Flack ? " she repeated in a moment. 

" Oh, do leave him alone ! " Francie replied, in 
one of her rare impatiences. 

" Then why are you so queer ? " 

" Oh, I'm tired ! " said Francie, turning away. 
And this was the simple truth ; she was tired of 
the consideration her sister saw fit to devote to the 
question of Mr. Probert s not having, since their 
return to Paris, brought his belongings to see them. 
She was overdone with Delia s theories on this 
subject, which varied from day to day, from the 
assertion that he was keeping his intercourse with 

H 



  



his American friends hidden from them because 
they were uncompromising, in their grandeur, to 
the doctrine that that grandeur would descend 
some day upon the Hotel de 1 Univers et de Chel 
tenham and carry Francie away in a blaze of glory. 
Sometimes Delia put forth the view that they 
ought to make certain of Gaston s omissions the 
ground of a challenge ; at other times she opined 
that they ought to take no notice of them. Francie, 
in this connection, had no theories, no impulses of 
her own ; and now she was all at once happy .and 
freshly glad and in love and sceptical and fright 
ened and indifferent. Her lover had talked to her 
but little about his kinsfolk, and she had noticed 
this circumstance the more because of a remark 
dropped by Charles Waterlow to the effect that he 
and his father were great friends : the word seemed 
to her odd in that application. She knew Gaston 
saw that gentleman, and the exalted ladies Mr. 
Probert s daughters, very often, and she therefore 
took for granted that they knew he saw her. But 
the most he had done was to say they would come 
and see her like a shot if once they should believe 
they could trust her. She had wished to know 
what he meant by their trusting her, and he had 
explained that it would appear to them too good to 
be true that she should be kind to him : some 
thing exactly of that sort was what they dreamed 
of for him. But they had dreamed before and been 
disappointed, and now they were on their guard. 





From the moment they should feel they were on 
solid ground they would join hands and dance 
round her. Francie s answer to this fanciful state 
ment was that she didn 't know what the young 
man was talking about, and he indulged in no at 
tempt on that occasion to render his meaning more 
clear; the consequence of which was that he felt 
he made a poor appearance. His uneasiness had 
not passed away, for many things in truth were 
dark to him. He could not see his father fraternis 
ing with Mr. Dosson, he could not see Margaret and 
Jane recognising an alliance in which Delia was 
one of the allies. He had answered for them be 
cause that was the only thing to do ; and this only 
just failed to be criminally reckless. What saved 
it was the hope he founded upon Mme. de Brecourt 
and the sense of how well he could answer to the 
others for Francie. He considered that Susan had, 
in her first judgment of this young lady, committed 
herself; she had really comprehended her, and her 
subsequent protest when she found what was in 
his heart had been a retractation which he would 
make her in turn retract. The girl had been revealed to her. and she would come round. A 
simple interview with Francie would suffice for this 
result : he promised himself that at the end of half 
an hour she should be an enthusiastic convert. At 
the end of an hour she would believe that she her 
self had invented the match had discovered the 
damsel. He would pack her off to the others as 



the author of the project; she would take it all 
upon herself, would represent her brother even as 
a little tepid. She would show nothing of that sort, 
but boast of her wisdom and energy ; and she would 
enjoy the comedy so that she would forget she 
had opposed him even for a moment. Gaston 
Probert was a very honourable young man, but his 
programme involved a good many fibs. 



VII. 

IT may as well be said at once that it was even 
tually carried out, and that in the course of a 
fortnight old Mr. Probe rt and his daughters alighted 
successively at the Hotel de 1 Univers et de Chel 
tenham. Francie s visit with her intended to Mme. 
de Brecourt bore exactly the fruit the young man 
had foreseen and was followed the very next day by 
a call from this lady. She took Francie out with 
her in her carriage and kept her the whole after 
noon, driving her over half Paris, chattering with 
her, kissing her, delighting in her, telling her they 
were already sisters, paying her compliments which 
made the girl envy her art of beautiful expression. 
After she had carried her home the countess rushed 
off to her father s, reflecting with pleasure that at 
that hour she should probably find her sister Mar 
guerite there. Mme. de Cliche was with the old 
man in fact (she had three days in the week for 
coming to the Cours la Reine) ; she sat near 
him in the firelight, telling him presumably her 





troubles ; for Maxime de Cliche was not quite the 
pearl that they originally had supposed. Mme. de 
Brecourt knew what Marguerite did whenever she 
took that little ottoman and drew it close to her 
father s chair : she gave way to her favourite vice, 
that of dolefulness, which lengthened her long face 
more ; it was unbecoming, if she only knew it. 
The family was intensely united, as we know ; but 
that did not prevent Mme, de Brecourt s having a 
certain sympathy for Maxime : he too was one of 
themselves and she asked herself what she would 
have done if she had been a well-constituted man 
with a wife whose cheeks were like decks in a high 
sea. It was the twilight hour in the winter days, 
before the lamps, that especially brought her out ; 
then she began her plaintive, complicated stories, 
to which her father listened with such angelic 
patience. Mme. de Brecourt liked his particular 
room in the old house in the Cours la Reine ; it 
reminded her of her mother s life and her young 
days and her dead brother and the feelings con 
nected with her first going into the world. Al- 
phonse and she had had an apartment, by her 
father s kindness, under that familiar roof, so that 
she continued to pop in and out, full of her fresh 
impressions of society, just as she had done when 
she was a girl. She broke into her sister s confi 
dences now ; she announced her trouvaille and did 
battle for it bravely. 

Five days later (there had been lively work in 





the meantime ; Gaston turned so pale at moments 
that she feared it would all result in a mortal illness 
for him and Marguerite shed gallons of tears), Mr. 
Prohert went to see the Dossons with his son. 
Mme. de Brecourt paid them another visit, a kind 
of official affair as she deemed it, accompanied by 
her husband ; and the Baron de Douves and his 
wife, written to by Gaston, by his father and by 
Margaret and Susan, came up from the country 
full of tension and responsibility. M. de Douves 
was the person who took the family, all round, most 
seriously and most deprecated anything in the 
nature of crude and precipitate action. He was a 
very small black gentleman, with thick eyebrows 
and high heels (in the country, in the mud, he wore 
sabots with straw in them), who was suspected by 
his friends of believing that he looked like Louis 
XIV. It is perhaps a proof that something of the 
quality of this monarch was really recognised in 
him that no one had ever ventured to clear up this 
point by a question. " La fainilh c est moi " ap 
peared to be his tacit formula, and he carried his 
umbrella (he had very bad ones), with a kind of 
sceptral air. Mme. de Brecourt went so far as to 
believe that his wife, in confirmation of this, took 
herself in a manner for Mme. de Maintenon : she 
had lapsed into a provincial existence as she might 
have harked back to the seventeenth century ; the 
world she lived in seemed about as far away. She 
was the largest, heaviest member of the family, 





and in the Vendee she was thought majestic, in 
spite of old clothes, of which she was fond and 
which added to her look of having come down from 
a remote past or reverted to it. She was at bottom 
an excellent woman, but she wrote roy ando? like 
her husband, and the action of her mind was 
wholly restricted to questions of relationship and 
alliance. She had an extraordinary patience of 
research and tenacity of grasp of a clue, and viewed 
people solely in the light projected upon them by 
others; that is, not as good or wicked, ugly or 
handsome, wise or foolish, but as grandsons, 
nephews, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters-in- 
law, cousins and second cousins. There was a 
certain expectation that she would leave memoirs. 
In Mme. de Brecourt s eyes this pair were very 
shabby, they did not payer de mine they fairly 
smelt of their province ; " but for the reality of the 
thing," she often said to herself, " they are worth 
all of us. We are diluted and they are pure, and 
any one with an eye would see it." " The thing 
was the legitimist principle, the ancient faith and 
even, a little, the grand air. 

The Marquis de Cliche did his duty with his 
wife, who mopped the decks, as Susan said, for 
the occasion, and was entertained in the red satin 
drawing-room by Mr. Dosson, Delia and Francie. 
Mr. Dosson wanted to go out when he heard of 
the approach of Gaston s relations, and the young 
man had to instruct him that this wouldn 't do. 







The apartment in question had had a various ex 
perience, but it had probably never witnessed 
stranger doings than these laudable social efforts. 
Gaston was taught to feel that his family made a 
great sacrifice for him, but in a very few days he 
said to himself that he was safe, now they knew 
the worst. They made the sacrifice, they definitely 
agreed to it. but they judged it well that he should 
measure the full extent of it. "Gaston must 
never, never, never be allowed to forget what we 
have done for him :" Mnie. de Brecourt told him 
that Marguerite de Cliche had expressed herself 
in that sense, at one of the family conclaves from 
which he had been absent. These high commis 
sions sat, for several days, with great frequency, 
and the young man could feel that if there was 
help for him in discussion his case was promis 
ing. He flattered himself that he showed infinite 
patience and tact, and Ids expenditure of the latter 
quality in particular was in itself his only reward, 
for it was impossible he should tell Francie what 
arts he had to practise for her. He liked to think 
however that he practised them successfully; for 
he held that it was by such arts the civilised man 
is distinguished from the savage. What they cost 
him was made up simply in this that his private 
irritation produced a kind of cheerful glow in 
regard to Mr. Dosson and Delia, whom he could not 
defend nor lucidly explain nor make people like, 
but whom he had ended, after so many days of 

familiar intercourse, by liking extremely himself. 
The way to get on with them it was an immense 
simplification was just to love them ; one could 
do that even if one couldn 't talk with them. He 
succeeded in making Mme. de Brecourt seize this 
nuance; she embraced the idea with her quick 
inflammability. " Yes," she said, " we must insist 
on their positive, not on their negative merits : 
their infinite generosity, their native delicacy. 
Their native delicacy, above all; we must work 
that ! " And the brother and sister excited each 
other magnanimously to this undertaking. Some 
times, it must be added, they exchanged a glance 
which expressed a sudden slightly alarmed sense 
of the responsibility they had put on. 

On the day Mr. Probert called at the Hotel de 
I Univers et de Cheltenham with his son, the 
pair walked away together, back to the Cours la 
Reine, without any immediate conversation. All 
that was said was some words of Mr. Probert s, 
with Gaston s rejoinder, as they crossed the 
Place de la Concorde. 

" We should have to have them to dinner." 
The young man noted his father s conditional, 
as if his acceptance of the Dossons were not yet 
complete ; but he guessed all the same that the 
sight of them had not made a difference for the 
worse : they had let the old gentleman down more 
easily than was to have been feared. The call 
had not been noisy a confusion of sounds ; which 

was very happy, for Mr. Probert was particular in 
this he could bear French noise but he could not 
bear American. As for English, he maintained that 
there was none. Mr. Dossoii had scarcely spoken to 
him and yet had remained perfectly placid, which 
was exactly what Gaston would have chosen. 
Francie s lover knew moreover (though he was a 
little disappointed that no charmed exclamation 
should have been dropped as they quitted the hotel), 
that her spell had worked : it was impossible the 
old man should not have liked her. 

"Ah, do ask them, and let it be very soon," 
he replied. " They 'll like it so much " 

"And whom can they meet who can meet 
them ? " 

" Only the family all of us : au complet. Other 
people we can have later." 

"All of us, au complet that makes eight. And 
the three of them," said Mr. Probert. Then he 
added, " Poor creatures ! " This exclamation gave 
Gaston much pleasure ; he passed his hand into his 
father s arm. It promised well ; it denoted a senti 
ment of tenderness for the dear little Dossons, con 
fronted with a row of fierce French critics, judged 
by standards that they had never even heard of. 
The meeting of the two parents had not made the 
problem of their commerce any more clear; 
but young Probert was reminded freshly by his 
father s ejaculation of that characteristic kindness 
which was really what he had built upon. The 







old gentleman, Leaven knew, had prejudices, 
but if they were numerous, and some of them very 
curious, they were not rigid. He had also such nice 
inconsistent feelings, such irrepressible indulgences, 
and they would ease everything off. He was in 
short an old darling, and with an old darling, 
in the long run, one was always safe. When 
they reached the house in the Cours la Heine 
Mr. Probert said : " I think you told me you are 
dining out." 

" Yes, with our friends." 

" Our friends ? Comme vous y allcz ! Come 
in and see me, then, on your return ; but not later 
than half-past ten." 

From this the young man saw that he had 
swallowed the dose ; if he had made up his mind 
that it wouldn 't do he would have announced 
the circumstance without more delay. This reflection was most agreeable, for Gaston was perfectly aware of how little he himself would have 
enjoyed a struggle. He would have carried it 
through, but he could not bear to think of it, and 
the sense that he was spared it made him feel at 
peace with all the world. The dinner at the hotel 
became a little banquet in honour of this state 
of things, especially as Francie and Delia raved, 
us they said, about his papa. 

" Well, I expected something nice, but he goes 
far beyond," Delia remarked. " That s my idea of 
a gentleman." 







" Ah, for that ! " said Gaston. 

" He s so sweet. I'm not a bit afraid of him," 
Francie declared. 

" Why should you be ? " 

" Well, I am of you," the girl went on. 

" Much you show it ! " her lover exclaimed. 

" Yes, I am," she insisted, " at the bottom 
of all." 

" Well, that s what a lady should be of her 
husband." 

" Well, I don 't know ; I'm more afraid than that. 
You 'll see." 

" I wish you were afraid of talking nonsense," 
said Gaston Probert. 

Mr. Dosson made no observation whatever about 
their honourable visitor ; he listened in genial, un 
prejudiced silence. It is a sign of his prospective 
son-in-law s perfect comprehension of him that 
Gaston knew this silence not to be in any degree 
restrictive : it did not mean that he had not been 
pleased. Mr. Dosson had simply nothing to say; 
he had not, like Gaston, a sensitive plate in his 
brain, and the important events of his life had 
never been personal impressions. His mind had 
had absolutely no history of that sort, and Mr. 
Probert s appearance had not produced a revolution. 
If the young man had asked him how he liked 
his father he would have said, at the most, " Oh, 
I guess he s all right ! " But what was more 
candid even than this, in Gaston s view (and it 

was quite touchingly so), was the attitude of the 
good gentleman and his daughters toward the 
others, Mesdames de Douves, de Brecourt and de 
Cliche and their husbands, who had now all filed 
before them. They believed that the ladies and 
the gentlemen alike had covered them with en 
dearments, were candidly, gushingly glad to make 
their acquaintance. They had not in the least 
seen what was manner, the minimum of decent 
profession, and what the subtle resignation of old 
races who have known a long historical discipline 
and have conventional forms for their feelings 
forms resembling singularly little the feelings 
themselves. Francie took people at their word 
when they told her that the whole mani&re'd etre 
of her family inspired them with an irresistible 
sympathy : that was a speech of which Mme. de 
Cliche had been capable, speaking as if for all the 
Proberts and for the old noblesse of France. It 
would not have occurred to the girl that such things 
need have been said as a mere garniture. Her 
lover, whose life had been surrounded with garni 
ture and who therefore might have been expected 
not to notice it, had a fresh sense of it now : he 
reflected that manner might be a very misleading 
symbol, might cover pitfalls and bottomless gulfs, 
when it had attained that perfection and corre 
sponded so little to fact. What he had wanted 
was that his people should be very civil at the 
hotel ; but with such a high standard of compli- 



 Ill 

ment where after all was sincerity ? And without 
sincerity how could people get on together when 
it came to their settling down to common life ? 
Then the Dossons might have surprises, and the 
surprises would be painful in proportion as their 
present innocence was great. As to the high 
standard itself there was no manner of doubt ; it 
was magnificent in its way. 



VIII. 

WHEN, on coming home the evening after his 
father had made the acquaintance of the Dossons, 
Gaston went into the room in which the old man 
habitually sat, Mr. Probert said, laying down his 
book and keeping on his glasses : " Of course you 
will go on living with me. You must understand 
that I don 't consent to your going away. You 
will have to occupy the rooms that Susan and 
Alphonse had." 

Gaston observed with pleasure the transition 
from the conditional to the future and also the 
circumstance that his father was quietly reading, 
according to his custom when he sat at home of 
an evening. This proved he was not too much 
off the hinge. He read a great deal, and very 
serious books ; works about the origin of things 
of man, of institutions, of speech, of religion. 
This habit he had taken up more particularly 
since the circle of his social life had grown so 
much smaller. He sat there alone, turning his 
pages softly, contentedly, with the lamp-light 
shining on his refined old head and embroidered 
dressing-gown. Formerly he was out every night 
in the week Gaston was perfectly aware that to 
many dull people he must even have appeared a 
little frivolous. He was essentially a social 
animal, and indeed except perhaps poor Jane, 
in her damp old castle in Brittany they were 
all social animals. That was doubtless part of 
the reason why the family had acclimatised itself 
in France. They had affinities with a society of 
conversation; they liked general talk and old 
high salons, slightly tarnished and dim, containing 
precious relics, where there was a circle round the 
fire and winged words flew about and there was 
always some clever person before the chimney- 
piece, holding or challenging the rest. That 
figure, Gaston knew, especially in the days before 
he could see for himself, had very often been his 
father, the lightest and most amiable specimen of 
the type that liked to take possession of the 
hearthrug. People left it to him; he was so 
transparent, like a glass screen, and he never 
triumphed in argument. His word on most 
subjects was not felt to be the last (it was usually 
not more conclusive than a shrugging, inarticulate 
resignation, an "Ah, you know, what will you 
have ? ") ; but he had been none the less a part of 
the essence of some dozen good houses, most of 
them over the river, in the conservative faubourg, 
and several to-day emptied receptacles, extin 
guished fires. They made up Mr. Probert s world 
a world not too small for him and yet not too 
large, though some of them supposed themselves 
to be very great institutions. Gaston knew the 
succession of events that had helped to make a 
difference, the most salient of which were the 
death of his brother, the death of his mother and 
above all perhaps the extinction of Mme. de 
Marignac, to whom the old gentleman used still 
to go three or four evenings out of the seven 
and sometimes even in the morning besides. 
Gaston was well aware what a place she had held 
in his father s life and affection, how they had 
grown up together (her people had been friends 
of his grandfather when that fine old Southern 
worthy came, a widower with a young son and 
several negroes, to take his pleasure in Paris in 
the time of Louis Philippe), and how much she 
had had to do with marrying his sisters. He was 
not ignorant that her friendship and all its 
exertions were often mentioned as explaining 
their position, so remarkable in a society in which 
they had begun after all as outsiders. But he 
would have guessed, even if he had not been told, 
what his father said to that. To offer the Proberts 
a position was to carry water to the fountain ; they 
had not left their own behind them in Carolina ; 
it had been large enough to stretch across the 
sea. As to what it was in Carolina there was no 
need of being explicit. This adoptive Parisian was 
by nature presupposing, but he was admirably gentle 
(that was why they let him talk to them before 
the fire lie was such a sympathising oracle), and 
after the death of his wife and of Mme. de 
Marignac, who had been her friend too, he was 
gentler than before. Gaston had been able to see 
that it made him care less for everything (except 
indeed the true faith, to which he drew still closer), 
and this increase of indifference doubtless helped 
to explain his collapse in relation to common 
Americans. 

" We shall be thankful for any rooms you will 
give us," the young man said. " We shall fill 
out the house a little, and won 't that be rather 
an improvement, shrunken as you and I have 
become ? " 

" You will fill it out a good deal, I suppose, with 
Mr. Dossori and the other girl." 

"Ah, Francie won 't give up her father and 
sister, certainly; and what should you think of 
her if she did ? But they are not intrusive ; they 
are essentially modest people ; they won 't put 
themselves upon us. They have great natural 
discretion." 

" Do you answer for that ? Susan does ; she is 
always assuring one of it," Mr. Probert said. 
" The father has so much that he wouldn 't even 
speak to me." 

" He didn 't know what to say to you." 


" How then shall I know what to say to him ? " 

" Ah, you always know ! " Gaston exclaimed. 

"How will that help us if he doesn 't know 
what to answer ? " 

" You will draw him out he is full of bonhomie" 

" Well, I won 't quarrel with your lonlwmmc (if 
he s silent there are much worse faults), nor even 
with the fat young lady, though she is evidently 
vulgar. It is not for ourselves I am afraid ; it s 
for them. They will be very unhappy." 

" Never, never ! " said Gaston. " They are too 
simple. They are not morbid. And don 't you 
like Francie ? You haven 't told me so," he added 
in a moment. 

" She says Par us, my dear boy." 

"Ah, to Susan too that seemed the principal 
obstacle. But she has got over it. I mean Susan 
has got over the obstacle. We shall make her 
speak French; she has a capital disposition for 
it ; her French is already almost as good as her 
English." 

" That oughtn 't to be difficult. What will you 
have ? Of course she is very pretty and I'm sure 
she is good. But I won 't tell you she is a marvel, 
because you must remember (you young fellows 
think your own point of view and your own expe 
rience everything), that I have seen beauties with 
out number. I have known the most charming 
women of our time women of an order to which 
Miss Francie, con rispctto parlando, will never 





begin to belong. I'm difficult about women how 
can I help it ? Therefore when you pick up a little 
American girl at an inn and bring her to us as a 
miracle, I feel how standards alter. J ai vu mieux 
que $a, mon clier. However, I accept everything 
to-day, as you know ; when once one has lost one s 
enthusiasm everything is the same, and one might 
as well perish by the sword as by famine." 

" I hoped she would fascinate you on the spot," 
Gaston remarked, rather ruefully. 

" Fascinate the language you fellows use ! " 

" Well, she will yet." 

" She will never know at least that she doesn 't : 
I will promise you that," said Mr. Probert. 

"Ah, be sincere with her, father she s worth 
it ! " his son broke out. 

When the old gentleman took that tone, the 
tone of vast experience and a fastidiousness justi 
fied by ineffable recollections, Gaston was more 
provoked than he could say, though he was also 
considerably amused, for he had a good while since 
made up his mind that there was an element of 
stupidity in it. It was fatuous to square one s 
self so serenely in the absence of a sense : so far 
from being fine it was gross not to feel Francie 
Dosson. He thanked God he did. He didn 't 
know what old frumps his father might have fre 
quented (the style of 1830, with long curls in 
front, a vapid simper, a Scotch plaid dress and a 
body, in a point suggestive of twenty whalebones, 
coming down to the knees), but he could remem 
ber Mme, de Marignac s Tuesdays and Thursdays 
and Fridays, with Sundays and other days thrown 
in, and the taste that prevailed in that milieu : 
the books they admired, the verses they read and 
recited, the pictures, great heaven ! they thought 
good, and the three busts of the lady of the house, 
in different corners (as a Diana, a Druidess and a 
Croyante : her shoulders were supposed to make up 
for her head), effigies which to-day even the least 
bad, Canova s would draw down a public casti- 
gation upon their authors. 

" And what else is she worth ? " Mr. Probert 
asked, after a momentary hesitation. 

" How do you mean, what else ? " 

" Her immense prospects, that s what Susan has 
been putting forward. Susan s insistence on them 
was mainly what brought over Jane. Do you 
mind my speaking of them ? "
