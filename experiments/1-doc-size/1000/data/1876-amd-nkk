hand and foot, what had you to offer her for her olden 
content, her unalloyed faith, her unstained sweetness? 
Ah, then you would say pityingly, " Well, she was foolish 
to marry such a clod ; but, having done it, there is 
nothing but to abide by her bargain-," and leave her to 
find her way back to the despoiled altar alone, if, haply, 
it might be found at all. Would she bless her fatal 
knowledge, think J T OU? 

As for her, she never dreamed of his speculations. He 
was an entertaining companion ; but she did not even seek 
to make a friend of him. Their acquaintance would end 
with this summer idling. It was like walking through 
some palace garden ; but she felt no desire to pluck 
blossoms simply because they were forbidden, and were 
for other hands. She had no small vanity to be elated. 
She had won the heart of one man, and was therewith 
content. 



CHAPTER 



"Such things, however, he used to do aforetime, also, he used 
to offer you a little of what he received ; but he used to set before 
himself the greater part." ARISTOPHANES' COMEDY. 

IT was a musical evening this time. The performers 
had been put down for certain parts, and were acquitting 
themselves creditably, without any halts or demurs. The 
audience were genially appreciative. In the pauses little 
knots and groups chatted gayly. 

Over in this corner, with a portfolio of Hogarth's satires 
between them, sat Mrs. Kinnard and Mr. Van Alstyne. 
She had done her part in singing, been very agreeable to 
some new-comers ; and now, rather to her surprise, she 
found herself alone with him in a somewhat earnest dis 
cussion. 

"Then you do not think," he was saying, " that this 
soul we have been speaking of has a right to free itself 
from the customs and shackles of society, and live out a 
higher life, one more true to itself ? " 

" Now you generalize quite too much, Mr. Van Al 
styne," she answered with a frank smile. "Isn't being 
'true to one's self ' a rather confusing term ? What if 
the self were wrong? In such a case, would the life have 
any greater freedom ? Would not the restless soul come 
to another bar presently, and fret against that ? Do not 
people occasionally mistake restlessness for develop 
ment?" 

" But one cannot remain forever in the same old groove. 

 

It is not natural or right. I hate people who fancy they 
are fitted, once for all, in some corner." 

" But it may fit them ; " and she glanced up brightly. 
" It seems to me a fortunate thing for the stability of the 
world, for progress even, that all do not want to change." 

" But you would take away improvement. And pardon 
me, Mrs. Kinnard, but that does not seem like you. I 
have admired you in many things, I cannot help it ; and 
one has been this very breadth and liberality of opinion." 

It was most delicate flatten". His eyes vouched for 
his earnestness, if not his truth. 

"What I mean is this, Mr. Van Alstyne," she said 
with the most direct simplicity. " There are certain 
known laws of right and wrong, subject to small modifica 
tions perhaps. But it seems hardly safe to me to stray 
out of the beaten path. When one begins to make new 
laws, there is no limit. Might it not be possible for these 
souls to improve under existing circumstances? Have 
they tried all in their own sphere, all work, all prayer, 
all patience ? ' ' 

He was not prepared to meet so important a question, 
and said, rather evasively, 

" Then you don't think anybody in this world is mis 
fitted, out of place? I do, I can't help it. Neither can 
I blame them for trying to get somewhere else. They 
may -make many mistakes before they find their true 
sphere." 

A grave light filled her beautiful eyes. 

" Yes : I have seen people whom I thought were out of 
place ; but, if they endeavored earnestly and patiently to 
fulfil their allotted tasks, there was a heroism about it that 
taught a grander lesson than any mere personal enjoy- 
ment. Do you not think, when a person sets out to have 
happiness or indulgence at any cost, he may take that 
which is clearly another's? What is a strong desire of 
that to which some other has attained, but covetous- 
ness?" 



" It might not be another person's." 

" But that was where we started from. This poor soul, 
seeing the richness and fulness of other lives, longs for 
liberty to get out of its sphere, to leave its duties behind, 
to seek pleasure wherever it can be found, perhaps the 
very thing, that God, for some wise purpose, is keeping 
out of its way. I have thought sometimes, that when a 
person desires a thing very much, a thing that others 
could see was wrong and improper, - God allowed him to 
attain it, and take the bitter consequences that followed 
in its train." 

" But it seems hard, when one has made a mistake, to 
forbid him to try again. Are you not a fatalist in happi 
ness?" and he smiled with a dangerous, alluring light. 
" If it comes, well and good : if not, make no search for 
it." 

"Not quite. The trouble is in making it the chief 
good, in searching so restlessly for it. "We are talking 
unwarrantably at an evening party, are we not? Miss 
Graham is going to sing ' Three Fishers ; ' and you must 
listen. And there is Miss Howe." 

She beckoned for the latter to join them. Van Alstyne 
bit his lip. Any other woman would have been delighted 
to keep him to herself. He was not used to friendly in 
difference on the part of the sex. And he wished she 
were not so horribly practical with her right and wrong. 
Why could she not compare and analyze feelings, emo 
tions, even wishes, and stray to that farther verge where 
love trenched upon passion ? Was there any thing intense 
or enthusiastic in her nature ? 

Provoked, he strayed off to another group. Daisy En- 
dicott had been talking earnestly ; and the flush was still 
on her face : her eyes had a peculiar, dew} r softness. He 
was bored by the music, and in a mood of vexed despera 
tion : so he brought out all his fascinations, and charmed 
her. 



 



happened to glance up, and caught sight of 
Daisy's rapt, attentive face. She crossed over to them, 
and would have detached her ; but it was not so easily 
done. He was a skilful tactician on his own ground. 

" Can she be jealous? " he thought with secret exulta 
tion. "Is she like other women in this? If so, I hold 
the trump-card." 

He had no fine scruples upon this point. It amused 
him to see one woman pitted against another. He had 
been good quite long enough. Not a single spicy flirta 
tion this whole summer ! 

He was tired of these intellectual arguments, compari 
sons of old and new truths, intricate and toilsome reason 
ings, higher culture, mental progress, growth, evolution, 
and all that. He was here in the world to have a good 
time. A long afternoon in some blossomy nook, watch 
ing the color come and go on a woman's cheek, her eyes 
droop, and the lids tremble, the scarlet lip quiver with 
contending emotions, the white hands clasp of themselves 
now and then, as if they were longing for some other 
clasp ah ! that was worth all the metaphysics in the 
world for him. 

" I don't object to the enjoyment of others : why should 
they to mine?" he reasoned petulantly to himself. "To 
show a woman that she has a heart is surely no great 
crime, so long as you do not win it." 

But where did he mean the knowledge to end, and the 
experience to begin? 

So far, Daisy Endicott had passed unscathed. While 
there had been much pleasure at Severn Point, flirtations 
had been kept in the background. Mrs. Glyndon was 
not the kind of woman to allow a man to drift into fond 
ness for her. She had very little sentiment ; and that was 
of the highest order. Nelly Kinnard would have blushed 
with shame at any one daring to esteem her in but one 
light, that of Dr. Kiuiiard's wife. Her theory was, 





that, in these cases, a woman must hold out some encour 
agement ; and she experienced a pitying sympathy for' 
those unfortunates who turned from ill-chosen companions 
to the dangerous sympathy and fascinating possibility that 
occasionally opened before them. 

But in Van Alstyne's code there were no fine distinctions. 
That subtle understanding must flash out when the right 
souls met. They need not cause a scandal (he would be 
the last one to do that) ; but they might admit in their 
secret hearts, that, if fate had led them in different paths 

Would he be content to stay in this path with this or 
that woman? It was a question he never asked himself. 
To him there was always an outgrowing, a sense of further 
development. But if, on the other side, there was not this 
fatal changing ? The most fickle man demands that the 
woman he loves shall be true to him. 

It was an easy matter to be a little more to Daisy 
Endicott. They had been such frank, good friends, this 
man of the world, and the simple-hearted girl. Why 
could he not let her grow and blossom for the one hand to 
pluck presently, to have and to hold forever? 

It was only a deeper meaning in the smiles ; the peculiar 
turn of a word or sentence ; a choice flower ; a bit of 
poetry, the pathos of which she could readily understand, 
and that he would hardly ofier at any other shrine on 
account of its rare simplicity ; asking aid and comfort 
in some weary moment, and showing her the despondency 
of his moods, while others believed he never had a serious 
feeling. 

" She will be none the worse for a little experience 
of her own," he argued selfishly, salving thereby his 
conscience. 

Opportunities, as I have said, were not wanting. Mat 
ters had settled into so comfortable a groove, that Mrs. 
Glj-ndon was no longer watchful. lie did not mean to 
draw any other person's attention to his idling ; and this 


 

very fact was calculated to blind an unsuspicious girl. 
Daisy Endicott knew so little of the fatal craving for ex 
citement ; her life had been so healthful, her duties fresh 
and varied, if simple. Her affection flowed in natural 
channels, and did not need to tread daintily and daringly 
to the verge of danger. There was no continual intro 
spection or morbid analysis : she lived daily in the ' ' open 
sunshine of God's love," and was content. 

Dr. Kinnard had made two brief visits at Severn Point, 
one of a night's duration, the other a little longer ; but 
he did not come for society. Nelly asked when they were 
to return home. 

' ' Are you not happy and content here ? ' ' was his half- 
humorous query. 

" Yes, both. But when I think of you in your lonely 
home, and with your pressing duties, I feel as if my place 
was at your side." 

" Thank you, my dear ; " and he drew her closer to his 
side with a fond pressure, though the grave little frown, 
that seldom meant any thing more than a puzzle, settled 
between his brows. "I may as well tell you the truth, 
Nelly ; " and then it cleared up. " The fever at Edgerly 
has been worse than I at first expected. At times I have 
felt quite discouraged. "What can you do when people 
are so afraid of fresh air and cleanliness ; when they spread 
their beds as soon as they are out of them ; allow all 
manner of refuse to gather in cellars, or lay festering in 
back-yards ; who are ignorant of the first laws of health, 
and stick obstinately to what their grandfathers and 
grandmothers did under widely different circumstances ? 
If it was only the poor and careless who sickened and 
died as the result of their own inefficiency but these 
things spread, as they have at Edgerly. "We are high, 
and out of reach of malaria ; but still it is a relief to have 
you and Bertie away. I have less to think of. I can 
come and go as I please ; and you may imagine that I am 
kept pretty busj r ." 





' ' But your own danger ! You think nothing of that ! ' ' 
she cried vehemently. 

" My own danger is not very alarming," he returned 
rather gaj'ly. " I have not lived in this world six and 
thirty years without learning to take care of nryself. 
Don't make a bugbear of that now ! I will promise you, 
that, at the first Symptom of any thing like indisposition, 
I will rejoin you here. There, is not that enough? It 
would be cowardly to desert my post in my present 
robust health." 

"But does Mary keep you quite comfortable?" the 
young wife inquired anxiously. 

" Mary is a jewel. Little Katy has been rather ailing : 
so we sent her away. I wanted mother to go; but" 
and he shrugged his shoulders. 

" You could not manage her as easily as you do me." 

' ' Exactly, Nelly ; ' ' and he gave a mellow laugh. ' ' She 
is on the spot, j'ou see, and will not go ; and, somehow " 

He rose in the long pause, and began to pace the floor 
thoughtfully. 

"Yes," he went on directty, " somehow matters have 
changed between us. She seems to care for watching 
over me, and doesn't fret as she used. Maybe I am 
more patient: I don't know. Actually, Nelty, she keeps 
fresh flowers on the dining-table, and has come to have 
wa} r s like you. It is very pleasant," in a kind of dreamy 
tone. 

"Very pleasant!" Nelly Kinnard crowded down 
something that seemed to rise with her breath. Another 
woman ministering in her place, standing in her stead, 
copying her ways, breathing soft and tender words, teach 
ing him to miss her less and less? There was a quick, 
sharp pang to be crowded out! Why, the child was 
not half to her that he was, her chosen husband. 
Should she not demand her right? 

She thrust out the foul temptation. If any jealous 

 

feeling entered in, it should not take possession. God 
had made him a son long before human love made him a 
husband. She ought to feel glad and satisfied that there 
was some one to cheer his solitude. 

She sprang up suddenly, holding out her hands with 
wordless entreaty. He took them with a little caress, 
then, infolding her with his arm, went on pacing the room 
with her at his side. 

" Nelly," and a touch of emotion trembled in his 
voice, " I think your life at Edgerly has been thorny in 
many ways. I might have helped some of it at first, if 
I had known how ; but I was afraid of making matters 
worse. And men cannot see with women's eyes, lucky for 
them sometimes that they do not ;" and he laughed with 
a flavor of irony. " I have to thank you for a great deal 
of patience and sweetness : nay, let me go on. I had a 
man's fancy that I was marrying you all for myself. I 
meant that you should be troubled with no responsibility 
of children, until it pleased God to grant you some of 
your.own. As for mother and Aunt Adelaide, what they 
thought was of small importance to me. But (shall I 
say it?) Providence" and there was a reverential in 
flection to his voice "has changed much of this. You 
have won a mother's sacred place in Bertie's affection, 
given him more tenderness than many mothers bestow. 
You have made him nearer to me : you have brought the 
solemn responsibility of fatherhood before me in its 
divine light. When I look back " 

She felt the arm tremble that clasped her so closely. 
Ah ! could any thing shut her out of his heart ? 

He was not much given to talking matters over. She 
would never know just what this separation was doing for 
him, for her ; how he missed her in a thousand ways 
that he could never have put in words ; how he lingered 
over her courage and tenderness of the past winter, 
discovering the exquisite delicacy and richness of a true 



 

woman's nature, thanking God with a strange humility 
for the rare gift vouchsafed to him. 

In this softened mood, he turned to his mother with a 
sympathy she had seldom received before. A century of 
living alone with her would never have brought out his 
best points. She fretted and jarred too much : he with 
drew to inward solitudes. Her stubborn pride would not 
have allowed her to soften perceptibly before Nelly ; and 
even now she would have fiercely resented any suspicion 
of copying such an inexperienced young woman. But 
she did many things with no higher motive, it must be 
confessed, than to please him ; and, in his changed mood, 
he was touched by these little evidences of affection on 
her part. People are not so widely separated as they 
imagine. Often the partition-wall is hardly more than 
paper, and needs but the right touch to break it down. 
These son-like ways were not as new to Ms thought, 
perhaps, as to the outward expression of them. There 
was no Aunt Adelaide to nip sentiment in the bud with 
her cold sneers. 

Dr. Kinnard bent, and kissed his wife tenderly. 

" I think we shall find a smoother way in the future, 
little woman," he went on with an effort at gayety, hard 
ly venturing to trust his voice further among the deep 
emotions of the soul. "And, when you return, I hope 
there will await you what you have not yet had, a 
mother's cordial welcome." 

Nelly gave the arm that encircled her a caressing 
pressure. 

" You will stay, and be content? You will not worry 
about me ? Have this much confidence in me, my dear 
child, that I shall not run any unnecessary risks. But 
it is hardly so bad as that." 

Yes, she would have faith in him, not only in the mat 
ter of the sickness, but in others of deeper moment. 
Nothing should impair the sweetness of her trust. 




And yet there were hours when she would have pre 
ferred toil beside him to the dreamy indolence to which 
she seemed condemned. True, Bertie improved every 
day. They resumed some of the discarded lessons, 
though it was more object than book teaching. She 
interested herself in household affairs with her gracious 
tact. 

"My asking you here was a positive inspiration," 
Mrs. Glyndon would exclaim. " What could I have 
done without you ? ' ' 

Mr. Van Alstyne remarked her pre-occupation. Did it 
betoken some secret dissatisfaction ? She watched Daisy 
with a quiet but unflagging solicitude. Was it a touch of 
jealousy, just enough to make her piquant, a fear lest 
he should prove too attractive ? He felt strangely elated 
by either view of the case. If he could only succeed in 
rousing her to any thing ! To see the fine dark eyes grow 
lustrous, to deepen the color on the beautiful cheek, or 
rouse the lips out of their placid curves ! Why, he could 
have won almost any other woman's soul with half the 
effort but, Mr. Van Alstyne, it would not have been 
this order of woman. 

An incident occurred just at this time that served to 
heighten his interest in both, and hasten the catastrophe 
Nelly was studying to avert. 

"I am going to send Dudley to Severn Point," said 
Dr. Kinnard in one of his letters. " He has worked him 
self out, and needs change and rest. Tell Mrs. Glyndon 
to take him in hand, while I prescribe negatives, no 
sermons, no theological points, no plans for parish work, 
nothing but eating, sleeping, and diversion." 

There had been a thinning-out at the hotels. Vacation 
had ended for some of the young men ; and the ladies 
needed fresh pastures. Tableaux had grown tiresome ; 
amateur concerts were on the wane ; picnics with gypsy 
suppers had lost their charm. Indeed, Mrs. Glyndon's 





evenings were the only entertainments that kept their 
piquancy and freshness. 

"Mr. Dudley will be quite an excitement," said Mrs. 
Gtyndon with a wonderful accession of interest. " Let 
me see the Edgecombes will just suit him; and they 
have that delightful second-story room empty. Nelty, 
we must go over and see." 

" That is the way with you women. You must always 
have some one new in your train, a tame bear, or a pet 
lion. Will I be eaten up, or growled at? " 

Mrs. Glyndon laughed heartily. 

" Upon my word, Mr. Van Alstyne, it is odd to rouse 
you to such fierceness. Why, I thought you were asleep 
there on the sofa : so Mrs. Kinnard and I would be quite 
at liberty to discuss ways and means. And then he is 
Mrs. Kinnard' s clergyman." 

' ' Father-confessor ? ' ' 

"Well not exactly;" and Mrs. Glyndon gave a 
funny perk to her brows. 

"So you throw me overboard. Well, republics are 
ungrateful." 

" Why, no. But you were complaining of dulness no 
longer ago than yesterday." 

" Was I? A man can repent, I suppose," raising his 
slow-moving, magnificent eyes. " I am tired of hanging 
around with hands full of shawls and baskets. The dewy 
uplands are wet ; the sun scorches you ; and the gnats 
sting in the shade " 

" And the spray wets you, the dancing heats you, the 
driving bores you. You are a spoiled child, Van 
Alstyne. You have been indulged until you think the 
whole world ought to revolve around j'ou. It is high 
time I took you in hand, and set you in your proper 
place." 

The pretty assumption of motherliness did not in the 
least offend him. When Mrs. Glyndon said she scolded, 





you might know of a truth that she was extra good- 
humored. 

" Why, we ought to go this \ery afternoon," she says 
presentlj-, jumping up in a little fluster. " To-day is 
Friday ; and Mr. Dudley will be here on Monday. You 
can amuse jxnirself, can you not, Van Alstyne? " 

" Oh, don't mind me ! I must go and sa}^ good-by to 
half a dozen women who set sail to-morrow ; " and he rises 
in a lazily-petulant manner while they are making their 
plans. Mr. Dudley's coming is not a pleasant prospect to 
him. 

" Addio," with regretful grace and ease. 



CHAPTER XVIH. 

" But had I wist, when first I kist, 

That love hae been sae ill to win, 
I'd locked my heart in case o' gowd, 
And pinned it wi' a siller pin." OLD BALLAD. 

No, it was not a pleasant prospect. He hated to be 
pushed aside for any man : he was not used to it where 
women were concerned. He was sauntering along in a 
vexed mood, when he met Miss Endicott, her hands full 
of feathery grasses, and looking like a "Watteau shepherd 
ess in her wide seaside hat with its white frilling and 
cheny-colored bows. 

" They are discussing Mr. Dudley, and will be out the 
next hour, hunting him up a domicile of some kind. So 
they don't need you, and I do ; for I am in a horridly ill- 
humor. "Will j'oii not take a ramble down to the Point, 
good Samaritan?" 

She glanced up into the handsome face with some 
indecision ; but the entreating eyes and beseeching smile 
conquered it. 

" I have been out all the afternoon with Miss Gra 
ham ' ' 

"Then finish it with me. There, we will lay the 
grasses in this sheltered nook ; " and he took them from 
her hand, slipping it within his arm. He knew well that 
taking possession was better than arguing half an hour. 

On they went to the gray ledges of rock, where they 
could sit with the shining sand at their feet, and the 

 

wide waters spread out before them. They were quite 
alone too. Out in the hazy distance, some fishermen 
were singing. The billows, crested -in pale emerald and 
frost-white, came in like fairy squadrons on some enchanted 
quest. The pale clear sun went dropping down in the 
west beyond the distant town, shedding a softened glory, 
instead of his usual fiery rays. The sky was of palest 
blue with long sapphire streaks. Bars of dim yellow, 
faint violet, and delicate rose, crossed the golden back 
ground, and presently mingled into cool, dreamy gray, 
that left a peculiar luminous track on the waves. 

He talked, and she listened with shy, girlish gladness. 
It was not so much what he said as his manner of saying 
it. She could not have repeated one entire sentence 
afterward; but the impression sank into her soul. She 
had a feeling that it would be delightful to stay here for 
ever, listening to the caressing sweetness of his voice, that 
chorded so exquisitely with the twilight rhythm of the sea. 
And, after a while, it was all gray about them, the 
purple and dun gray of coming night. 

" Oh ! " she cried, rousing herself, " we must go home. 
I did not dream it was so late." 

He started at the full, rich depths of her voice, the 
tone that comes from a soul that has been quaffing draughts 
from Circean fountains. He had willed to be fascinating, 
to stir the depths of her nature ; and he had succeeded. 
If he preserved that grave, brotherly demeanor, she would 
never know how near she had been to the fatal shore. 
Could he ? It was only pastime, on his part ; and he had 
gone far enough. Would he? 

They walked slowly back. She was in too much of an 
enchanted atmosphere to be disturbed by any anxiety of 
what was to come. They found the grasses ; and he went 
with her to the gate. Ah ! after all, had he the manliness 
to let her* go? the soft, brown fluttering dove. 

They said good-night. Then he turned. It was a 
cruel deed on his part. 





" Daisy," he had always called her Miss Enclicott 
before, " Daisj^, you will not allow this new-comer to 
crowd me out? I ought to retain some of the rights of a 
friend, surely." His voice sank to that low, entreating 
sweetness. "Promise." 

" Yes," she answered softly, overcome by some subtle 
knowledge. Then he raised her hand, and pressed an 
eager kiss upon it. 

She did not think, " He loves me." Her shyness and 
humility would have forbidden that until he confessed it. 
She was on a wide, delicious sea, satisfied to drift care 
lessly into port. 

She opened the hall-door slowly. A softened light 
came from the dining-room, where they were at the table, 
with the addition of Miss Howe, who had " run over" to 
discuss her new plans. She was to go to Paris in Septem 
ber. 

" Well, truant ! " was the gay exclamation. " You and 
Miss Graham did not quite conclude to play babes in the 
wood. Oh, what beautiful grasses ! Did you go to the 
hotel?" 

" Yes," answered Daisy. Miss Howe's voice restored 
her to every-day life. 

" Did you see her dress? Isn't it exquisite? You are 
not going to the hop? It is the last at Eastwoods." 

" No," returned Mrs. Glyndon. 

"You staid late," said Nelly gently. 

" My dear Mrs. Kinnard, think of girls' confidences 
over new gowns ! I remember of holding some lengthy 
ones a decade ago ; and I am still fond of pretty dresses. 
What were we talking of, Mrs. Glyndoii? Oh, those 
French apartments ! I think the}^ would be pleasanter. 
We shall have Mrs. McLean to matronize us, you know. 
Yv T hen I went before with papa, we were at hotels ; but 
that was merely touring. Now I expect to live." 

Daisy took her place, and ate her supper. Afterward, 



 

she changed her dress ; for some one always dropped in. 
Circumstances, and not any design of her own, had given 
her a secret, too rare and precious to be brought out to 
common day. And with secrets begins danger. 

Van Alstyne was over the next afternoon with Miss 
Howe, who teased him concerning a rosebud one of the 
ladies at the hotel had given him. 

" I think you are envious," he said plaj-fully. " Here, 
I am going to leave it to perish in Miss Endicott's hair. 
It could not have a better fate." 

He leaned over and fastened it, hiding the blushing 
face in a friendly manner, and giving one daring glance 
into the frightened eyes. 

"Wiry, Severn Point will be almost deserted when 
your party go," said Mrs. Glyndon. "What will you 
do? " and she turned to Van Alstyne. 

" I don't see why I should rush off to the city amid 
the sweltering heat of August," he replied impatiently. 
" If you are tired of me, I might take a hunting-tour to 
the Rocky Mountains until New York gets habitable 
once more." 

"Why, no: we are not tired of you," and she gave 
him a rather puzzled look ; " but I think, sometimes, that 
you are tired of j'ourself. Summer holidays are delight 
ful ; but life is not all summer." 

He shrugged his shoulders daintily. " It will be time 
enough to think of winter by and by. I daresay I shall 
astonish you, some day, by a vast amount of hidden and 
well seasoned talent." 

"I only hope you will," said Miss Howe. "I know 
well enough that you could." 

" For instance, when the divining-finger of love touches 
me;" and his eyes wandered in a downcast manner to 
Daisy Endicott. 

" Van Alstyne ! " cried Miss Howe sharply. " A man 
who depends upon love for his redemption is hardly worth 
saving." 





"Perhaps I am not. I don't know," he said with 
strange, sad softness. 

Mr. Dudley came, according to arrangement. He was 
looking quite worn now. There was nothing in his 
appearance to compare with Mr. Van Alstyne, it was 
true ; and yet his was a fine, scholarly face, with truthful 
63-68, and a frank smile, a man who gave the impres 
sion of much quiet courage and persistence ; who, though 
not lacking in energy, would win more souls by his tire 
less patience than by hurrying them out of danger. 

They had to talk, first of all, about Edgerly. The fever 
had been worse than Dr. Kinnard had admitted to them. 

"But he is just the man to take such a matter in 
hand," explained Mr. Dudley in a glow of admiration. 
" He did one good thing, cleared out Hull's Row root 
and branch ; and the whole block is torn down to make 
room for something better. Why, the basement-walls were 
thick with mould. The worst cases of fever were there ; 
and, when three died in one day, the authorities found it 
was high time to bestir themselves. I wish he could be 
put in president of the Board of Health : he wouldn't go 
at evils with light kid gloves, I assure you." 

Nelly smiled appreciatively. " I have been afraid all 
the time that something would happen to him." 

" He has such a magnificent physique, Mrs. Kinnard! 
And then didn't you leave a little of yourself in the 
house?" with a quick, questioning smile. "Mrs. Chase 
went away ; and the doctor, j*ou see, made me come but 
and spend the nights with him. It is all so different from 
what it used to be ! I can't exactly tell, but wonderfully 
enjoyable ; and it made me think continually of you." 

Mr. Van Alstyne felt a good deal annoyed at the 
"parson's freedom," as he termed it. In a fit of morti 
fied vanity, he half resolved to go away. The little 
Endicott might get fond of him." 

Then he discovered, with a man's sharp eyes, that 


Arthur Dudley was not altogether insensible to her 
charms. No, he would stay and see the fun out. 

The party had diminished so much, that Mr. Dudley 
and Mr. Van Alstyne were the only constant attendants. 
The drives, the sails, and rambles were to be taken over 
again. He had either Daisy or Mrs. Kinnard for a 
companion. 

He used to fancy sometimes, that, if he had met her 
before her foolish marriage, it was always foolish to 
him, she might have been the one woman to awaken 
his ambition, and lead him in some useful path. He 
quite forgot the many brilliant and rarely endowed women 
who had crossed his way. Still there was something 
eminently attractive in her very directness, her truth, and 
honor. Even a friendship with her there would be no 
breach of decorum in that. 

Ah ! her eyes were too clear. She had been trained, in 
her simple home, to finer reasonings than the picturesque 
imaginings of what might have been under different cir 
cumstances, or the so-called metaphysical distinctions 
that confuse vice and virtue. He was a handsome, 
attractive, cultured man ; but his specious arguments had 
no more weight with her from that fact. His dangerous 
beauty could make no impression on this woman ; and it 
stung him keenly. 

There was a week or ten days of odd, under-current 
skirmishing. Mrs. Kinnard was throwing her sister into 
Mr. Dudley's hands, that was evident ; and Dudley was 
going into the realms of fancy with rapid strides. But 
he could summon Miss Endicott back again. There was 
a subtle understanding between, something that would 
have been quite indescribable on Daisy's part, had she 
wanted to confess it ; and no pure, sweet soul like hers 
could have talked over a suspected love. It had not come 
near enough to isolate her, not even to set her thinking 
what this friendly tenderness on Mr. Dudley's part meant. 





September came in brilliantly, with magnificent sun 
sets that made the sea a glow of fire. Dr. Kinnard was 
to come for a week, and then the household would break 
np ; Mrs. Glyndon going on a westward tour with her 
husband. Nelly counted the daj's from no spirit of 
ungraciousness, but a positive longing for relief from the 
strain upon her. A thrilling fear had taken possession 
of her. Save Daisy she must, if she exerted herself to 
the utmost ; and never had Van Alstyne made himself 
more dangerous. She had the strong safeguard of a 
husband's love., and her own honor; but how was Daisy, 
to know the shoals and quicksands of this desperate 
tide! 

This was what Van Alstyne liked. He could not 
understand her noble impulse ; but he saw she was re 
solved to keep him away from her sister, even if she 
made the utmost exertion. It brought out the latent 
forces of her nature, many charming little ways that a 
society-belle might have envied for their dainty piquancy. 

"I shall have one more entertainment," said Mrs. 
Gbyndon. ' ' I want to ask the Daventrj-s and the Max 
wells ; but I am a little puzzled ; ' ' and there she 
paused. 

"About what?" asked Daisy, looking up from her 
game of chess with Van Alstyne, who was playing shame 
fully into her hands. 

"I want it to be real charming, of course. If the 
Howe party were here, we would make it music and con 
versation ; but the Daventry girls are extravagantby fond 
of dancing. Dr. Kinnard and Mr. Dudley will be here, 
and how to suit the different tastes " 

" "Why, have everything," said Van Alstyne, looking 
up with a glow of interest, talking for the sedate, music 
for the sentimental, and dancing for such commonplace 
people as Miss Endicott and I. There ! why do you not 
say ' check ? ' You may never have so good a chance 
again." 





" You have not been tiying in real earnest." 

"And j-ou consider me of so little worth, that you 
won't even take me at a game of chess." 

"I oh!" and Daisj' blushed distressfully under the 
glance of the deep eyes. 

" Yes, Mrs. Glyndon, that will be the best of all," he 
went on. " And then one of your dainty suppers." 

" There is not much space for dancing; but, if I do 
undertake it, I want your very best assistance, Mr. Van 
Alstyne. No indolent indifference, mind you. I should 
hate to have a failure." 

" We could open Nelly's room, you know," said Daisy. 

" And have the band from the hotel. Why, let me see, 
next Wednesdaj-, it will be almost full moon." 

' ' Just magnificent ! Now you have it all without any 
trouble." 

"I think we might make it really delightful. And 
there is Mrs. Kinnard and Bertie." 

Van Alstyne bent over to pick up a fallen chessman. 
"Remember," he said, "you are engaged to me fora 
good share of the dancing. Have you forgotten that my 
very first introduction to you was as partner for a qua 
drille?" 

No, she had not. And she was touched by his remem 
brance of it. 

They sent out their invitations, and everybody began to 
count on the pleasure. Afterward there would be a gen 
eral dispersion. Even Van Alstj'ne spoke of taking a 
little run up in Canada. 

Tuesday brought Dr. Kinnard. Nelly welcomed him 
with an hysterical cry of joy. 

" Well, you see I am not worn to skin and bone by 
any means," he said laughingly. " I think I could go 
through another summer with tolerable comfort, though I 
prefer an autumn sandwiched between. But I am quite 
satisfied with you. Why, you are positively radiant. 
Won't you be ashamed of an old chap like me? " 





" I am so glad to have you, so glad ! " she cried with 
quivering lips. 

" I do bolieve } - ou are. No handsome j'oung man has 
put you out of conceit with j*our old fellow? Come, I 
will not have any tears for my welcome." 

They rambled together out of doors all the evening. 
Van Alstyne supposed her in her room, and was a little 
vexed at her sudden desertion, enforced, as he insisted it 
must be. Mrs. Glyndon sent both men home early, 
declaring she and Miss Endicott could not afford to lose 
their beauty sleep. 

They were busy enough the next day, preparing, and 
adorning the rooms. Mr. Dudley brought in some 
branches of sumach, and clusters of scarlet maple-leaves. 
The weather was still warm ; and the evening promised to 
be exceptionally fine. The band came, and was stationed 
on the balcony. The rooms were all thrown open ; the 
guests began to assemble with most cordial greetings. 
Colored lanterns had been hung around, giving the house 
quite a gala appearance. 

George Van Alstyne was in a most daring and bewil 
dering mood. Mrs. Kinnard looked radiant to-night, and 
he meant to make her bestow a good deal of attention 
upon him, if he flirted desperately with Daisy Endicott to 
gain it. 

And Daisy? She, too, was touched by the vague 
something in the atmosphere. A peculiar knowledge had 
come to her, like a blinding flash of light ; and it had not 
brought happiness. When she first came down, Arthur 
Dudley stood in the hall. He turned for one quick 
glance. 

Her soft white dress and white sash gave her a sugges 
tive bridal look, relieved only by a knot of scarlet leaves 
in her hair, and another at her throat. The dewy eyes, 
the faint tint in the checks, the smiling, summer-ripe lips, 
and the fair, clear skin, made her beautiful as youth. 




health, and happiness only can. Oddly enough, Van Al- 
styne had chosen her attire. She was thinking of that. 
Arthur Dudley thought, " How fair she is ! the one woman 
in the world for me. Does she know, does she guess, that 
I love her? " and then some fatal impetuosity lured him 
forward. He crossed the hall, took both hands in his, 
stooped and kissed her, and then would have given any 
thing to recall the hasty impulse. 

" Forgive," he murmured softly, entreating. 

She turned with a blushing face. Some one spoke in 
the hall above. There was a stir out of doors ; and she 
was glad to escape. 

There was no thrill of joy, rather a shiver of pain. 
And why ? Last spring and summer she had liked him 
so much ! Had these ten weeks changed her feelings ? 
She was ignorant no longer. Her eyes were opened to 
that sweet mystery. 

" But I cannot, cannot love him ! " she cried to her 
self despairingly ; and her whole being seemed tossed in
