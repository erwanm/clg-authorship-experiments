you’ve got to it.”

“Possibly it might not be much of a vein after all,” suggested Philip.

“Possibly it is; I’ll bet it’s forty feet thick. I told you. I knew the
sort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it.”

Philip’s next thought was to write to his friends and announce their
good fortune. To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm
as he could make it. They had found coal of excellent quality, but
they could not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was. The
prospecting was still going on. Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though
this letter may have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning
anthracite. He needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his
ardor when he sat down to write to Ruth. But it must be confessed that
the words never flowed so easily before, and he ran on for an hour
disporting in all the extravagance of his imagination. When Ruth read
it, she doubted if the fellow had not gone out of his senses. And it was
not until she reached the postscript that she discovered the cause of
the exhilaration. “P. S.--We have found coal.”

The news couldn’t have come to Mr. Bolton in better time. He had never
been so sorely pressed. A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any one
of which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed just
a little more money to save that which had been invested. He hadn’t a
piece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even to
the wild tract which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no
marketable value above the incumbrance on it.

He had come home that day early, unusually dejected.

“I am afraid,” he said to his wife, “that we shall have to give up our
house. I don’t care for myself, but for thee and the children.”

“That will be the least of misfortunes,” said Mrs. Bolton, cheerfully,
“if thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is wearing thee
out, we can live any where. Thee knows we were never happier than when
we were in a much humbler home.”

“The truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small’s has come
on me just when I couldn’t stand another ounce. They have made another
failure of it. I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or
fools, I don’t know which, have contrived to involve me for three times
as much as the first obligation. The security is in my hands, but it
is good for nothing to me. I have not the money to do anything with the
contract.”

Ruth heard this dismal news without great surprise. She had long felt
that they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation
at any hour. Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage
to undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament
which blinds one to difficulties and possible failures. She had little
confidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father
out of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she
was a child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as
prosperous as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash
amid so many brilliant projects. She was nothing but a woman, and did
not know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a
bubble of credit and speculation, one scheme helping to float another
which is no better than it, and the whole liable to come to naught and
confusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power
to devise, or when some accident produces a sudden panic.

“Perhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet,” said Ruth, with an
approach to gaiety; “When we move into a little house in town, will
thee let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON? Mrs. Dr.
Longstreet, thee knows, has a great income.”

“Who will pay for the sign, Ruth?” asked Mr. Bolton.

A servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office. Mr. Bolton
took his letters listlessly, dreading to open them. He knew well what
they contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands for money.

“Oh, here is one from Philip. Poor fellow. I shall feel his
disappointment as much as my own bad luck. It is hard to bear when one
is young.”

He opened the letter and read. As he read his face lightened, and he
fetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both exclaimed.

“Read that,” he cried, “Philip has found coal!”

The world was changed in a moment. One little sentence had done it.
There was no more trouble. Philip had found coal. That meant relief.
That meant fortune. A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the
whole household rose magically. Good Money! beautiful demon of Money,
what an enchanter thou art! Ruth felt that she was of less consequence
in the household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was
not sorry to feel so.

Mr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning. He went into the
city, and showed his letter on change. It was the sort of news his
friends were quite willing to listen to. They took a new interest in
him. If it was confirmed, Bolton would come right up again. There would
be no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted. The money
market did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before. Mr.
Bolton spent a very pleasant day in his office, and went home revolving
some new plans, and the execution of some projects he had long been
prevented from entering upon by the lack of money.

The day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement. By daylight,
with Philip’s letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal
had been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up
to see for themselves.

The “prospecting” continued day and night for upwards of a week, and
during the first four or five days the indications grew more and more
promising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted.
But at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming
rapidity. In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a
doubt that the great “find” was nothing but a worthless seam.

Philip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish
as to send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing
about. And now he must contradict it. “It turns out to be only a mere
seam,” he wrote, “but we look upon it as an indication of better further
in.”

Alas! Mr. Bolton’s affairs could not wait for “indications.” The
future might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and
hopeless. It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin.
Yet sacrifice he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving
something from the wreck of his fortune.

His lovely country home must go. That would bring the most ready money.
The house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his
family, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the
grounds that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the
tastes of his wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare
trees and flowers, the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were
a passion almost; this home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy
long after he had done with it, must go.

The family bore the sacrifice better than he did. They declared in
fact--women are such hypocrites--that they quite enjoyed the city
(it was in August) after living so long in the country, that it was a
thousand times more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was
a relief from the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her
father that she should have had to come to town anyway before long.

Mr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened by
throwing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo--but the leak
was not stopped. Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by the
prudent step he had taken. It was regarded as a sure evidence of his
embarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain
help than if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new
speculation.

Philip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the
bringing about of the calamity.

“You must not look at it so!” Mr. Bolton wrote him. “You have neither
helped nor hindered--but you know you may help by and by. It would have
all happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole. That is
only a drop. Work away. I still have hope that something will occur to
relieve me. At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have
any show.”

Alas! the relief did not come. New misfortunes came instead. When the
extent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that
Mr. Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no
resource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his
creditors.

The Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but still
with hope. He had again and again been encouraged by good “indications,”
 but he had again and again been disappointed. He could not go on much
longer, and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless
to go on as long as he had been doing.

When the news came of Mr. Bolton’s failure, of course the work stopped.
The men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful noise of
pickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that desolate and
mournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise.

Philip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in
them. How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him
most. How changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto
stood for the exemplification of happiness and prosperity.

He still had faith that there was coal in that mountain. He made a
picture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel,
digging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and
year after year, until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that
region as the old man of the mountain. Perhaps some day--he felt it must
be so some day--he should strike coal. But what if he did? Who would
be alive to care for it then? What would he care for it then? No, a man
wants riches in his youth, when the world is fresh to him. He wondered
why Providence could not have reversed the usual process, and let the
majority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it, and die poor
when they no longer needed it.

Harry went back to the city. It was evident that his services were no
longer needed. Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not
read to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some
government contracts in the harbor there.

Philip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam;
the world was all before him whereto choose. He made, before he went
elsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet
not without its sweetnesses. The family had never shown him so much
affection before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more
importance than their own misfortune. And there was that in Ruth’s
manner--in what she gave him and what she withheld--that would have made
a hero of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.

Among the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold, and
Philip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to even
undertake the mortgage on it except himself. He went away the owner of
it, and had ample time before he reached home in November, to calculate
how much poorer he was by possessing it.

CHAPTER L.

It is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions, to
control events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or
to be successful. It is easy to see how things might have been better
managed; a very little change here and there would have made a very
different history of this one now in hand.

If Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he might
now be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an honest
lawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving’s bank and built a
cottage, and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself.
Instead of this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is
at his mother’s house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the
hardness and, dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get
the coal out of the Ilium hills.

If Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins
family and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon
Congress, and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of
those appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members
find it so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would
not be lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing
her best, by the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of
criminal procedure in New York.

If Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat he
set foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col. Sellers
never would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and probably
never into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now be
detained in New York from very important business operations on the
Pacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of
murder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself. If
Mr. Bolton had said the little word “no” to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague
might now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also
(waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would
not be an assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with
arduous routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the
burdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family.

It is altogether a bad business. An honest historian, who had progressed
thus far, and traced everything to such a condition of disaster
and suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative and
writing--“after this the deluge.” His only consolation would be in the
reflection that he was not responsible for either characters or events.

And the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously
applied, would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these
people; but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult
to get when people need it most.

A little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would
now establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the
excessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor. A
little money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more
would calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however
the trial ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end.
And if Philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in
the mountain whence would issue a stream of shining riches. It needs a
golden wand to strike that rock. If the Knobs University bill could only
go through, what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of
the persons in this history. Even Philip himself would feel the good
effects of it; for Harry would have something and Col. Sellers would
have something; and have not both these cautious people expressed a
determination to take an interest in the Ilium mine when they catch
their larks?

Philip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill. He
had not been at the Montague’s since the time he saw Ruth there, and he
wanted to consult the Squire about an occupation. He was determined now
to waste no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at
something, if it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill
Seminary, or digging clams on Hingham beach. Perhaps he could read law
in Squire Montague’s office while earning his bread as a teacher in the
Seminary.

It was not altogether Philip’s fault, let us own, that he was in this
position. There are many young men like him in American society, of
his age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been
educated for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that
they will find somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the
golden road to fortune. He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a
disposition to carve his own way. But he was born into a time when all
young men of his age caught the fever of speculation, and expected to
get on in the world by the omission of some of the regular processes
which have been appointed from of old.

And examples were not wanting to encourage him. He saw people, all
around him, poor yesterday, rich to-day, who had come into sudden
opulence by some means which they could not have classified among any of
the regular occupations of life. A war would give such a fellow a
career and very likely fame. He might have been a “railroad man,” or a
politician, or a land speculator, or one of those mysterious people
who travel free on all rail-roads and steamboats, and are continually
crossing and recrossing the Atlantic, driven day and night about nobody
knows what, and make a great deal of money by so doing. Probably, at
last, he sometimes thought with a whimsical smile, he should end by
being an insurance agent, and asking people to insure their lives for
his benefit.

Possibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill were
increased by the presence of Alice there. He had known her so long,
she had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the
pleasure of her society without thinking much about it. Latterly he
never thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the
subject any attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness
that, he had her sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing
to hear him talk about it. If he ever wondered that Alice herself was
not in love and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it
was a transient thought for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one
so calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her herself.

Whatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as they
are to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not, and
carrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had
to bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a
self-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,
have no conception. Have not these big babies with beards filled all
literature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations?
It is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and
implacable.

“Do you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend the
county Court?” asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his new
programme.

“Perhaps not always,” said Philip, “I might go and practice in Boston
maybe, or go to Chicago.”

“Or you might get elected to Congress.”

Philip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing
him. Her face was quite sober. Alice was one of those patriotic women
in the rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on
account of qualifications for the office.

“No,” said Philip, “the chances are that a man cannot get into congress
now without resorting to arts and means that should render him unfit to
go there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that I
could not go into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing
somewhat in my profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of
my intentions and unselfishness? Why, it is telegraphed all over the
country and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes
honestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position
to steal from the government.”

“But,” insisted Alice, “I should think it a noble ambition to go to
congress, if it is so bad, and help reform it. I don’t believe it is as
corrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in
the novels, and I suppose that is reformed.”

“I’m sure I don’t know where the reform is to begin. I’ve seen a
perfectly capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate
trickster, and get beaten. I suppose if the people wanted decent members
of congress they would elect them. Perhaps,” continued Philip with a
smile, “the women will have to vote.”

“Well, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I
would go to war and do what I could, if the country couldn’t be saved
otherwise,” said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he
thought he knew her. “If I were a young gentleman in these times--”

Philip laughed outright. “It’s just what Ruth used to say, ‘if she were
a man.’ I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of
sex.”

“No, only a changed sex,” retorted Alice; “we contemplate for the most
part young men who don’t care for anything they ought to care for.”

“Well,” said Philip, looking humble, “I care for some things, you and
Ruth for instance; perhaps I ought not to. Perhaps I ought to care for
Congress and that sort of thing.”

“Don’t be a goose, Philip. I heard from Ruth yesterday.”

“Can I see her letter?”

“No, indeed. But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her, together
with her anxiety about her father.”

“Do you think, Alice,” asked Philip with one of those selfish thoughts
that are not seldom mixed with real love, “that Ruth prefers her
profession to--to marriage?”

“Philip,” exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking
hurriedly as if the words were forced from her, “you are as blind as a
bat; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute.”

Philip never noticed that Alice’s face was flushed and that her voice
was unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard. And
the poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her
room, locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her
heart would break. And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would
give her strength. And after a time she was calm again, and went to
her bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper,
yellow with age. Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow
also. She looked long at this foolish memento. Under the clover leaf was
written in a school-girl’s hand--“Philip, June, 186-.”

Squire Montague thought very well of Philip’s proposal. It would have
been better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left
college, but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some
knowledge of the world.

“But,” asked the Squire, “do you mean to abandon your land in
Pennsylvania?” This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to
this New England lawyer-farmer. “Hasn’t it good timber, and doesn’t the
railroad almost touch it?”

“I can’t do anything with it now. Perhaps I can sometime.”

“What is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?”

“The opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own observation
of the country, and the little veins of it we found. I feel certain it
is there. I shall find it some day. I know it. If I can only keep the
land till I make money enough to try again.”

Philip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and
pointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to
tunnel.

“Doesn’t it look like it?”

“It certainly does,” said the Squire, very much interested. It is not
unusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such
a venture than a speculator who, has had more experience in its
uncertainty. It was astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the
time of the petroleum excitement, took chances in oil. The Wall street
brokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country
clergymen, who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying
the New York stock board.

“I don’t see that there is much risk,” said the Squire, at length. “The
timber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does run
there, it’s a magnificent fortune. Would you like to try it again in the
spring, Phil?”

Like to try it! If he could have a little help, he would work himself,
with pick and barrow, and live on a crust. Only give him one more
chance.

And this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague was
drawn into this young fellow’s speculation, and began to have his serene
old age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of
luck.

“To be sure, I only care about it for the boy,” he said. The Squire was
like everybody else; sooner or later he must “take a chance.”

It is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they
are not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men. It
is only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of
gambling. Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of
Philip’s renewal of his mining enterprise.

But Philip was exultant. He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were already
made, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton were
already in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried. Towards spring he
went to Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign. His
enthusiasm was irresistible.

“Philip has come, Philip has come,” cried the children, as if some great
good had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang itself
over in Ruth’s heart as she went the weary hospital rounds. Mr. Bolton
felt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of his manly
face and the sound of his cheery voice.

Ruth’s course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become
Philip, who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible
result of her determination and industry, to open an argument with
her. Ruth was never more certain that she was right and that she was
sufficient unto herself. She, may be, did not much heed the still small
voice that sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work, and
which lightened it and made it easy, “Philip has come.”

“I am glad for father’s sake,” she said to Philip, “that thee has come.
I can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do. He thinks
women won’t hold out long,” added Ruth with the smile that Philip never
exactly understood.

“And aren’t you tired sometimes of the struggle?”

“Tired? Yes, everybody is tired I suppose. But it is a glorious
profession. And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?”

“Well, yes, a little,” said Philip, feeling his way towards what he
wanted to say.

“On what, for instance, just now?” asked Ruth, a little maliciously
Philip thought.

“Why, on--” he couldn’t quite say it, for it occurred to him that he
was a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his
fortune, and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he
was.

“I don’t mean depend,” he began again. “But I love you, that’s all. Am
I nothing--to you?” And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he
had said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of
obligation on either side, between man and woman.

Perhaps Ruth saw this. Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a
certain equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts,
might be pushed too far. Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness
and the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest
confessed, as that which Philip could give. Whatever moved her--the
riddle is as old as creation--she simply looked up to Philip and said in
a low voice, “Everything.”

And Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her
eyes, which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true
woman’s nature--

“Oh! Philip, come out here,” shouted young Eli, throwing the door wide
open.

And Ruth escaped away to her room, her heart singing again, and now as
if it would burst for joy, “Philip has come.”

That night Philip received a dispatch from Harry--“The trial begins
tomorrow.”

CHAPTER LI.

December 18--, found Washington Hawkins and Col. Sellers once more at
the capitol of the nation, standing guard over the University bill.
The former gentleman was despondent, the latter hopeful. Washington’s
distress of mind was chiefly on Laura’s account. The court would soon
sit to try her case, he said, and consequently a great deal of ready
money would be needed in the engineering of it. The University bill was
sure to pass this time, and that would make money plenty, but might not
the help come too late? Congress had only just assembled, and delays
were to be feared.

“Well,” said the Colonel, “I don’t know but you are more or less right,
there. Now let’s figure up a little on, the preliminaries. I think
Congress always tries to do as near right as it can, according to its
lights. A man can’t ask any fairer than that. The first preliminary it
always starts out on, is to clean itself, so to speak. It will arraign
two or three dozen of its members, or maybe four or five dozen, for
taking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter.”

“It goes up into the dozens, does it?”

“Well, yes; in a free country likes ours, where any man can run for
Congress and anybody can vote for him, you can’t expect immortal purity
all the time--it ain’t in nature. Sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty
people are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise, as young
Hicks the correspondent says; but still it is a very good average; very
good indeed. As long as it averages as well as that, I think we can feel
very well satisfied. Even in these days, when people growl so much and
the newspapers are so out of patience, there is still a very respectable
minority of honest men in Congress.”

“Why a respectable minority of honest men can’t do any good, Colonel.”

“Oh, yes it can, too”

“Why, how?”

“Oh, in many ways, many ways.”

“But what are the ways?”

“Well--I don’t know--it is a question that requires time; a body
can’t answer every question right off-hand. But it does do good. I am
satisfied of that.”

“All right, then; grant that it does good; go on with the
preliminaries.”

“That is what I am coming to. First, as I said, they will try a lot of
members for taking money for votes. That will take four weeks.”

“Yes, that’s like last year; and it is a sheer waste of the time for
which the nation pays those men to work--that is what that is. And it
pinches when a body’s got a bill waiting.”

“A waste of time, to purify the fountain of public law? Well, I never
heard anybody express an idea like that before. But if it were, it would
still be the fault of the minority, for the majority don’t
institute these proceedings. There is where that minority becomes an
obstruction--but still one can’t say it is on the wrong side.--Well,
after they have finished the bribery cases, they will take up cases of
members who have bought their seats with money. That will take another
four weeks.”

“Very good; go on. You have accounted for two-thirds of the session.”

“Next they will try each other for various smaller irregularities, like
the sale of appointments to West Point cadetships, and that sort of
thing--mere trifling pocket-money enterprises that might better be
passed over in silence, perhaps, but then one of our Congresses
can never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all
blemishes--and that is a thing to be applauded.”

“How long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities?”

“Well, about two weeks, generally.”

“So Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session.
That’s encouraging. Colonel, poor Laura will never get any benefit
from our bill. Her trial will be over before Congress has half purified
itself.--And doesn’t it occur to you that by the time it has expelled
all its impure members there may not be enough members left to do
business legally?”

“Why I did not say Congress would expel anybody.”

“Well won’t it expel anybody?”

“Not necessarily. Did it last year? It never does. That would not be
regular.”

“Then why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members?”

“It is usual; it is customary; the country requires it.”

“Then the country is a fool, I think.”

“Oh, no. The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled.”

“Well, when nobody is expelled, what does the country think then?”

“By that time, the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick
and tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms. But all that
inquiry is not lost. It has a good moral effect.”

“Who does it have a good moral effect on?”

“Well--I don’t know. On foreign countries, I think. We have always been
under the gaze of foreign countries. There is no country in the world,
sir, that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do. There is no
country in the world whose representatives try each other as much as
ours do, or stick to it as long on a stretch. I think there is something
great in being a model for the whole civilized world, Washington.”

“You don’t mean a model; you mean an example.”

“Well, it’s all the same; it’s just the same thing. It shows that a man
can’t be corrupt in this country without sweating for it, I can tell you
that.”

“Hang it, Colonel, you just said we never punish anybody for villainous
practices.”

“But good God we try them, don’t we! Is it nothing to show a disposition
to sift things and bring people to a strict account? I tell you it has
its effect.”

“Oh, bother the effect!--What is it they do do? How do they proceed?
You know perfectly well--and it is all bosh, too. Come, now, how do they
proceed?”

“Why they proceed right and regular--and it ain’t bosh, Washington, it
ain’t bosh. They appoint a committee to investigate, and that committee
hears evidence three weeks, and all the witnesses on one side swear
that the accused took money or stock or something for his vote. Then
the accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it, but he was
receiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesn’t
remember this particular circumstance--at least with sufficient
distinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing
is not proven--and that is what they say in the verdict. They don’t
acquit, they don’t condemn. They just say, ‘Charge not proven.’ It
leaves the accused in a kind of a shaky condition before the country, it
purifies Congress, it satisfies everybody, and it doesn’t seriously hurt
anybody. It has taken a long time to perfect our system, but it is the
most admirable in the world, now.”

“So one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that
lame silly way. Yes, you are correct. I thought maybe you viewed the
matter differently from other people. Do you think a Congress of ours
could convict the devil of anything if he were a member?”

“My dear boy, don’t let these damaging delays prejudice you against
Congress. Don’t use such strong language; you talk like a newspaper.
Congress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members--now you
know that. When they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a cloud of witnesses
proved him to be--well, you know what they proved him to be--and his own
testimony and his own confessions gave him the same character, what did
Congress do then?--come!”

“Well, what did Congress do?”

“You know what Congress did, Washington. Congress intimated plainly
enough, that they considered him almost a stain upon their body; and
without waiting ten days, hardly, to think the thing over, they rose up
and hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his
conduct! Now you know that, Washington.”

“It was a terrific thing--there is no denying that. If he had been
proven guilty of theft, arson, licentiousness, infanticide, and defiling
graves, I believe they would have suspended him for two days.”

“You can depend on it, Washington. Congress is vindictive, Congress is
savage, sir, when it gets waked up once. It will go to any length to
vindicate its honor at such a time.”

“Ah well, we have talked the morning through, just as usual in these
tiresome days of waiting, and we have reached the same old result; that
is to say, we are no better off than when we began. The land bill is
just as far away as ever, and the trial is closer at hand. Let’s give up
everything and die.”

“Die and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone? Oh, no, that won’t
do. Come, now, don’t talk so. It is all going to come out right. Now
you’ll see.”

“It never will, Colonel, never in the world. Something tells me that. I
get more tired and more despondent every day. I don’t see any hope; life
is only just a trouble. I am so miserable, these days!”

The Colonel made Washington get up and walk the floor with him, arm in
arm. The good old speculator wanted to comfort him, but he hardly knew
how to go about it. He made many attempts, but they were lame; they
lacked spirit; the words were encouraging; but they were only words--he
could not get any heart into them. He could not always warm up, now,
with the old Hawkeye fervor. By and by his lips trembled and his voice
got unsteady. He said:

“Don’t give up the ship, my boy--don’t do it. The wind’s bound to fetch
around and set in our favor. I know it.”

And the prospect was so cheerful that he wept. Then he blew a
trumpet-blast that started the meshes of his handkerchief, and said in
almost his breezy old-time way:

“Lord bless us, this is all nonsense! Night doesn’t last always; day has
got to break some time or other. Every silver lining has a cloud behind
it, as the poet says; and that remark has always cheered me; though--I
never could see any meaning to it. Everybody uses it, though, and
everybody gets comfort out of it. I wish they would start something
fresh. Come, now, let’s cheer up; there’s been as good fish in the sea
as there are now. It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers-- Come in?”

It was the telegraph boy. The Colonel reached for the message and
devoured its contents:

“I said it! Never give up the ship! The trial’s postponed till February,
and we’ll save the child yet. Bless my life, what lawyers they have in
New-York! Give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse, and
they: would manage to postpone anything in this world, unless it might
be the millennium or something like that. Now for work again my boy. The
trial will last to the middle of March, sure; Congress ends the fourth
of March. Within three days of the end of the session they will be done
putting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national
business. Our bill will go through in forty-eight hours, then, and we’ll
telegraph a million dollars to the jury--to the lawyers, I mean--and
the verdict of the jury will be ‘Accidental murder resulting from
justifiable insanity’--or something to, that effect, something to that
effect.--Everything is dead sure, now. Come, what is the matter? What
are you wilting down like that, for? You mustn’t be a girl, you know.”

“Oh, Colonel, I am become so used to troubles, so used to failures,
disappointments, hard luck of all kinds, that a little good news breaks
me right down. Everything has been so hopeless that now I can’t stand
good news at all. It is too good to be true, anyway. Don’t you see how
our bad luck has worked on me? My hair is getting gray, and many nights
I don’t sleep at all. I wish it was all over and we could rest. I wish
we could lie down and just forget everything, and let it all be just a
dream that is done and can’t come back to trouble us any more. I am so
tired.”

“Ah, poor child, don’t talk like that-cheer up--there’s daylight ahead.
Don’t give up. You’ll have Laura again, and--Louise, and your mother,
and oceans and oceans of money--and then you can go away, ever so far
away somewhere, if you want to, and forget all about this infernal
place. And by George I’ll go with you! I’ll go with you--now there’s my
word on it. Cheer up. I’ll run out and tell the friends the news.”

And he wrung Washington’s hand and was about to hurry away when his
companion, in a burst of grateful admiration said:

“I think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew, Colonel
Sellers! and if the people only knew you as I do, you would not be
tagging around here a nameless man--you would be in Congress.”

The gladness died out of the Colonel’s face, and he laid his hand upon
Washington’s shoulder and said gravely:

“I have always been a friend of your family, Washington, and I think I
have always tried to do right as between man and man, according to my
lights. Now I don’t think there has ever been anything in my conduct
that should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that.”

He turned, then, and walked slowly out, leaving Washington abashed and
somewhat bewildered. When Washington had presently got his thoughts
into line again, he said to himself, “Why, honestly, I only meant to
compliment him--indeed I would not have hurt him for the world.”

CHAPTER LII.

The weeks drifted by monotonously enough, now. The “preliminaries”
 continued to drag along in Congress, and life was a dull suspense to
Sellers and Washington, a weary waiting which might have broken their
hearts, maybe, but for the relieving change which they got out of an
occasional visit to New York to see Laura. Standing guard in Washington
or anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace, but
standing guard was all that the two friends had to do; all that was
needed of them was that they should be on hand and ready for any
emergency that might come up. There was no work to do; that was all
finished; this was but the second session of the last winter’s Congress,
and its action on the bill could have but one result--its passage. The
house must do its work over again, of course, but the same membership
was there to see that it did it.--The Senate was secure--Senator
Dilworthy was able to put all doubts to rest on that head. Indeed it was
no secret in Washington that a two-thirds vote in the Senate was ready
and waiting to be cast for the University bill as soon as it should come
before that body.

Washington did not take part in the gaieties of “the season,” as he had
done the previous winter. He had lost his interest in such things; he
was oppressed with cares, now. Senator Dilworthy said to Washington that
an humble deportment, under punishment, was best, and that there was but
one way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose and peace.
The suggestion found a response in Washington’s breast, and the Senator
saw the sign of it in his face.

From that moment one could find the youth with the Senator even oftener
than with Col. Sellers. When the statesman presided at great temperance
meetings, he placed Washington in the front rank of impressive
dignitaries that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the platform. His
bald headed surroundings made the youth the more conspicuous.

When the statesman made remarks in these meetings, he not infrequently
alluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of the
wealthiest and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking
the light vanities of that butterfly existence to nobly and
self-sacrificingly devote his talents and his riches to the cause of
saving his hapless fellow creatures from shame and misery here and
eternal regret hereafter.

At the prayer meetings the Senator always brought Washington up the
aisle on his arm and seated him prominently; in his prayers he
referred to him in the cant terms which the Senator employed, perhaps
unconsciously, and mistook, maybe, for religion, and in other ways
brought him into notice. He had him out at gatherings for the benefit of
the negro, gatherings for the benefit of the Indian, gatherings for the
benefit of the heathen in distant lands. He had him out time and again,
before Sunday Schools, as an example for emulation. Upon all these
occasions the Senator made casual references to many benevolent
enterprises which his ardent young friend was planning against the day
when the passage of the University bill should make his means available
for the amelioration of the condition of the unfortunate among his
fellow men of all nations and all climes. Thus as the weeks rolled on
Washington grew up into an imposing lion once more, but a lion that
roamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance, and revisited the
glittering domain of fashion no more. A great moral influence was thus
brought to bear in favor of the bill; the weightiest of friends flocked
to its standard; its most energetic enemies said it was useless to fight
longer; they had tacitly surrendered while as yet the day of battle was
not come.

CHAPTER LIII.

The session was drawing toward its close. Senator Dilworthy thought he
would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them
look at him. The legislature whose duty it would be to re-elect him
to the United States Senate, was already in session. Mr. Dilworthy
considered his re-election certain, but he was a careful, painstaking
man, and if, by visiting his State he could find the opportunity to
persuade a few more legislators to vote for him, he held the journey to
be well worth taking. The University bill was safe, now; he could leave
it without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer. But
there was a person in his State legislature who did need watching--a
person who, Senator Dilworthy said, was a narrow, grumbling,
uncomfortable malcontent--a person who was stolidly opposed to reform,
and progress and him,--a person who, he feared, had been bought with
money to combat him, and through him the commonwealth’s welfare and its
politics’ purity.

“If this person Noble,” said Mr. Dilworthy, in a little speech at a
dinner party given him by some of his admirers, “merely desired to
sacrifice me.--I would willingly offer up my political life on the altar
of my dear State’s weal, I would be glad and grateful to do it; but when
he makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs, when he proposes
to strike through me at the heart of my beloved State, all the lion
in me is roused--and I say, Here I stand, solitary and alone, but
unflinching, unquailing, thrice armed with my sacred trust; and whoso
passes, to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection,
must do so over my dead body.”

He further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely
misguided, he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked
designs through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State
which would work untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he
would not suffer; the public morals must not be contaminated. He would
seek this man Noble; he would argue, he would persuade, he would appeal
to his honor.

When he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified; they
were standing firmly by him and were full of courage. Noble was
working hard, too, but matters were against him, he was not making much
progress. Mr. Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for Mr. Noble;
he had a midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil
ways; he begged him to come again and again, which he did. He finally
sent the man away at 3 o’clock one morning; and when he was gone, Mr.
Dilworthy said to himself,

“I feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved.”

The Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of
his people. He appeared in church; he took a leading part in prayer
meetings; he met and encouraged the temperance societies; he graced the
sewing circles of the ladies with his presence, and even took a needle
now and then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor
Bibleless pagan of the South Seas, and this act enchanted the ladies,
who regarded the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified. The
Senator wrought in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from
the Sunday Schools--neither sickness nor storms nor weariness. He even
traveled a tedious thirty miles in a poor little rickety stagecoach to
comply with the desire of the miserable hamlet of Cattleville that he
would let its Sunday School look upon him.

All the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived, two
bonfires were burning, and a battery of anvils was popping exultant
broadsides; for a United States Senator was a sort of god in the
understanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier
than a county judge. To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague
colossus, an awe inspiring unreality.

Next day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before
time for Sunday School to open; ranchmen and farmers had come with their
families from five miles around, all eager to get a glimpse of the
great man--the man who had been to Washington; the man who had seen the
President of the United States, and had even talked with him; the man
who had seen the actual Washington Monument--perhaps touched it with his
hands.

When the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were full,
the aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was the yard
in front of the building. As he worked his way through to the pulpit
on the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials of
the village, every neck was stretched and, every eye twisted around
intervening obstructions to get a glimpse. Elderly people directed each
other’s attention and, said, “There! that’s him, with the grand, noble
forehead!” Boys nudged each other and said, “Hi, Johnny, here he is,
there, that’s him, with the peeled head!”

The Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister on one side
of him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other. The
town dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings
below. The Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches
dressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair
combed and faces too clean to feel natural. So awed were they by the
presence of a living United States Senator, that during three minutes
not a “spit ball” was thrown. After that they began to come to
themselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they
were reciting verses and pulling hair.

The usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then
the minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the
customary Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar;
then the town dignitaries had their say. They all made complimentary
reference to “their friend the Senator,” and told what a great and
illustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for
religion and temperance, and exhorted the little boys to be good and
diligent and try to become like him some day. The speakers won the
deathless hatred of the house by these delays, but at last there was an
end and hope revived; inspiration was about to find utterance.

Senator Dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full minute
in silence. Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children
and began:

“My little friends--for I hope that all these bright-faced little people
are my friends and will let me be their friend--my little friends,
I have traveled much, I have been in many cities and many States,
everywhere in our great and noble country, and by the blessing of
Providence I have been permitted to see many gatherings like this--but I
am proud, I am truly proud to say that I never have looked upon so much
intelligence, so much grace, such sweetness of disposition as I see in
the charming young countenances I see before me at this moment. I have
been asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far-off
monarchy, looking upon little princes and princesses? No. Am I in some
populous centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the
land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize?
No. Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels
that we know not of? No. Then where am I? Yes--where am I? I am in a
simple, remote, unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these
are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I
am! My soul is lost in wonder at the thought! And I humbly thank Him to
whom we are but as worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call
me to serve such men! Earth has no higher, no grander position for me.
Let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my
heart is here!
