shake the building: 

“Long live the king!” 

Poor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this 
stupefying spectacle, and finally rested dreamily 
upon the kneeling princesses beside him a moment, 
then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden ptirpose 
dawned in his face. He said, in a low tone, at Lord 
Hertford’s ear: 

“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honor! 
Uttered I here a command, the which none but a 
king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter, 
would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise 
up to say me nay?” 

“None, my liege, in all these realms. In thy 
person bides the majesty of England. Thou art the 
king — thy word is law.” 

Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and 
with great animation; 

“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from 
this day, and never more be law of blood! Up 
from thy knees and away! To the Tower and say 
the king decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”  
The words were caught up and carried eagerly 
from lip to Hp far and wide over the hall, and as 
Hertford hurried from the presence, another pro- 
digious shout burst forth; 

“The reign of blood is ended! Long live Edward 
king of England!” 


CHAPTER XII 

AS soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince 
were clear of the mob, they struck down 
through back lanes and alleys toward the river. 
Their way was unobstructed until they approached 
London Bridge; then they plowed into the multitude 
again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the prince’s 
—no, the king’s— wrist. The tremendous news 
was already abroad, and the boy learned it from a 
thousand voices at once — “The king is dead!” 
The tidings struck a ctdll to the heart of the poor 
little waif, and sent a shudder through his frame. 
He realized the greatness of his loss, and was filled 
with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who had 
been such a terror to others had always been gentle 
with him. The tears sprung to his eyes and blurred 
all objects. For an instant he felt himself the most 
forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s creatures — 
then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching 
thunders; “Long live King Edward the Sixth!” 
and this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with 
pride to his fingers’ ends. “Ah,” he thought, 
“how grand and strange it seems — am king!” 

Our friends threaded theh way slowly through the 
throngs upon the Bridge. This structure, which had 
stood for six hundred years, and had been a noisy 
and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious 
affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and 
shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along 
both sides of it, from one bank of the river to the 
other. The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it 
had its inn, its beerhouses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, 
its food markets, its manufacturing industries, and 
even its church. It looked upon the two 
neighbors which it linked together — London and 
Southwark — as being well enough, as suburbs, but 
not otherwise particularly important. It was a close 
corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, 
of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its population 
was but a village population, and everybody in 
it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately, and had 
known their fathers and mothers before them — and 
all their little family affairs into the bargain. It had 
its aristocracy, of coiurse — its fine old families of 
butchers, and bakers, and what not, who had occu- 
pied the same old premises for five or six hundred 
years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from 
beginning to end, and all its strange legends; and 
who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy 
thoughts, and lied in a long, level, direct, substantial 
bridgy way. It was just the sort of population to 
be narrow and ignorant and self -conceited. Children 
were bom on the Bridge, were reared there, grew to 
old age and finally died without ever having set a 
foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge 
alone. Such people would naturally imagine that 
the mighty and interminable procession which 

moved througii its street night and day, with its 
confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and 
bellowings and bleatings and its muffled thundertramp, 
was the one great thing in this world, and 
themselves somehow the proprietors of it. And so 
they were in effect — at least they could exhibit it 
from their windows, and did — for a consideration 
whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting 
splendor, for there was no place like it for affording 
a long, straight, uninterrupted view of marching 
columns. 

Men bom and reared upon the Bridge found life 
unendurably dull and inane elsewhere. History tells 
of one of these who left the Bridge at the age of 
seventy-one and retired to the country. But he 
could only fret and toss in his bed; he could not go 
to sleep, the deep stillness was so paiaful, so awful, 
so oppressive. When he was worn out with it, at 
last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard 
specter, and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant 
dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters 
and the boom and crash and thunder of London 
Bridge. 

In the times of which we are writing, the Bridge 
furnished “object lessons” in English history, for 
its children — namely, the livid and decaying heads 
of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of 
its gateways. But we digress. 

Hendon’s lodgings were in the little inn on the 
Bridge. As he neared the door with his small friend, 
a rough voice said: 

“So, thou’rt come at last! Thou’lt not escape 

again, I warrant thee; and if pounding thy bones to 
a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thoult not 
keep us waiting another time, mayhap” — and John 
Canty put out his hand to seize the boy. 

Miles Hendon stepped in the way, and said: 

“Not too fast, friend. Thou art needlessly rough, 
methinks. What is the lad to thee?” 

“If it be any business of thine to make and 
meddle in others’ affairs, he is my son.” 

“’Tis a lie!” cried the little king, hotly. 

“Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy 
small head-piece be sound or cracked, my boy. 
But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no, 
’tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and 
abuse, according to his threat, so thou prefer to 
abide with me.” 

“I do, I do — know him not, I loathe him, and 
win die before I will go with him.” 

“Then ’tis settled, and there is naught more to 
say.” 

“We win see, as to that!” exclaimed John Canty, 
striding past Hendon to get at the boy; “by force 
shall he — ” 

“If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, 
I will spit thee like a goose!” said Hendon, barring 
the way and laying his hand upon his sword-hilt. 
Canty drew back. “Now mark ye,” continued 
Hendon, “I took this lad under my protection 
when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled 
him, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert 
him now to a worser fate? — for whether thou art his 
father or no — and sooth to say, I think it is a lie —  

a decent swift death were better for such a lad than 
life in such brute hands as thine. So go thy ways, 
and set quick about it, for I like not much bandying 
of words, being not overpatient in my nature.” 

John Canty moved off, muttering threats and 
curses, and was swallowed from sight in the crowd. 
Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room, 
with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent 
thither. It was a poor apartment, with a shabby 
bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in 
it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly 
candles. The little king dragged himself to the bed 
and lay down upon it, almost exhausted with hunger 
and fatigue. He had been on his feet a good part 
of a day and a night, for it was now two or three 
o’clock in the morning, and had eaten nothing 
meantime. He murmured drowsily: 

“Prithee, call me when the table is spread,” and 
sunk into a deep sleep immediately. 

A snule twinkled in Hendon’s eye, and he said 
to himself: 

“By the mass, the little beggar takes to one’s 
quarters and usurps one’s bed with as natural and 
easy a grace as if he owned them — with never a 
by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of 
the sort. In his diseased ravings he called himself 
the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth he keep up 
the character. Poor little friendless rat, doubtless 
his mind has been disordered with ill usage. Well, 
t will be his friend; I have saved him, and it draweth 
me strongly to him; already I love the bold-tongued 
little rascal. How soldierlike he faced the smutty 
rabble and flung back his high defiance! And what 
a comely, sweet and gentle face he hath, now that 
sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs. 
I will teach him, I will cure his malady; yea, I will 
be his elder brother, and care for him and watch over 
him; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt, 
may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for it 
he shall need it!” 

He bent over the boy and contemplated him with 
kind and pitying interest, tapping the young cheek 
tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with 
his great brown hand. A slight shiver passed over 
the boy’s form. Hendon muttered : 

“See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie 
here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums. 
Now what shall I do? ’Twill wake him to take him 
up and put him within the bed, and he sorely 
needeth sleep.” 

He looked about for extra covering, but finding 
none, doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it, 
saying, “I am used to nipping air and scant ap- 
parel, ’tis little I shall mind the cold” — then walked 
up and down the room to keep his blood in motion, 
soliloquizing as before. 

“His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of 
Wales; ’twOl be odd to have a Prince of Wales still 
with us, now that he that was the prince is prince 
no more, but king — for this poor mind is set upon 
the one fantasy, and will not reason out that now it 
should cast by the prince and call itself the king. 
... If my father liveth still, after these seven years 
that I have heard naught from home in my foreign 
dungeon, he will welcome the poor lad and give him 
generous shelter for my sake; so will my good elder 
brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh — but I 
win crack his crown, an he interfere, the fox- 
hearted, ill-conditioned animal! Yes, thither will 
we fare — and straightway, too.” 

A servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed 
it upon a small deal table, placed the chairs, and 
took his departure, leaving such cheap lodgers as 
these to wait upon themselves. The door slammed 
after him, and the noise woke the boy, who sprung 
to a sitting posture, and shot a glad glance about 
him; then a grieved look came into his face and he 
murmured to himself, with a deep sigh, “Alack, it 
was but a dream. Woe is me.” Next he noticed 
Miles Hendon’s doublet — glanced from that to 
Hendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been 
made for him, and said, gently: 

“Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to 
me. Take it and put it on — I shall not need it 
more.” 

Then he got up and walked to the washstand in 
the comer, and stood there waiting. Hendon said 
in a cheery voice : 

“We’ll have a right hearty sup and bite now, for 
everything is savory and smoking hot, and that and 
thy nap together will make thee a little man again, 
never fear!” 

The boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, 
that was filled with grave surprise, and also some- 
what touched with impatience, upon the tall knight 
of the sword. Hendon was puzzled, and said; 

“What’s amiss?” 

“Good sir, I wotdd wash me.” 

“Oh, is that all! Ask no permission of Miles 
Hendon for aught thou cravest. Make thyself per- 
fectly free here and welcome, with all that are his 
belongings.” 

Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he 
tapped the floor once or twice with his small impa- 
tient foot. Hendon was wholly perplexed. Said he ; 

“Bless us, what is it?” 

“Prithee, pour the water, and make not so many 
words!” 

Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to 
himself, “By all the saints, but this is admirable!” 
stepped briskly forward and did the small insolent’s 
bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction, 
until the command, “Come — the towel!” woke 
him sharply up. He took up a towel from under 
the boy’s nose and handed it to him, without com- 
ment. He now proceeded to comfort his own face 
with a wash, and while he was at it his adopted child 
seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to. 
Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then 
drew back the other chair and was about to place 
himself at table, when the boy said, indignantly: 

“Forbear! Wouldst sit in the presence of the 
king?” 

This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. 
He muttered to himself, “Lo, the poor thing’s 
madness is up with the time! it hath changed with 
the great change that is come to the realm, and now 
in fancy is he king! Good lack, I must humor the 

conceit, too — there is no other way — faith, he wouldl 
order me to the Tower, else!” 

And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair 
from the table, took his stand behind the king, and 
proceeded to wait upon him in the courthest way he 
was capable of. 

When the king ate, the rigor of his royal dignity 
relaxed a little, and with his growing contentment 
came a desire to talk. He said: 

“I think thou caJlest thyself Miles Hendon, if I 
heard thee aright?” 

“Yes, sire,” Miles replied; then observed to 
himself, “If I must humor the poor lad’s madness, 
I must sire him, I must majesty him, I must not go 
by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to 
the part I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil 
to this charitable and krndly cause.” 

The king warmed his heart with a second glass of 
wine, and said: “I would know thee — tell me thy 
story. Thou hast a gallant way with thee, and a 
noble — art nobly bom?” 

“We are of the tail of the nobility, good your 
majesty. My father is a baronet — one of the 
smaller lords, by knight service— Sir Richard Hen- 
don, of Hendon Hall, by Monk’s Holm in Kent.” 

“The name has escaped my memory. Go on — 
tell me thy story.” 

“’Tis not much, your majesty, yet perchance it 
may beguile a short half-hour for want of a better. 

* He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes — the harones 
minor esy as distinct from the parliamentary barons; — not, it need 
hardly be said, the baronets of later creation. 


My father, Sir Richard, is very rich, and of a most 
generous nature. My mother died whilst I was yet 
a boy. I have two brothers: Arthur, my elder, with 
a soul like to his father’s; and Hugh, younger than 
I, a mean spirit, covetous, treacherous, vicious, 
underhanded — sl reptile. Such was he from the 
cradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw 
him — a ripe rascal at nineteen, I being twenty then, 
and Arthur twenty-two. There is none other of us 
but the Lady Edith, my cousin — she was sixteen, 
then — beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an 
earl, the last of her race, heiress of a great fortune 
and a lapsed title. My father was her guardian. I 
loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed 
to Arthur from the cradle, and Sir Richard would 
not suffer the contract to be broken. Arthur loved 
another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and hold 
fast to the hope that delay and luck together would 
some day give success to our several causes. Hugh 
loved the Lady Edith’s fortune, though in truth he 
said it was herself he loved — but then ’twas his 
way, alway, to say one thing and mean the other. 
But he lost his arts upon the girl; he could deceive 
my father, but none else. My father loved him 
best* of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he 
was, the youngest child and others hated him — these 
qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parent’s 
dearest love; and he had a smooth persuasive tongue, 
with an admirable gift of lying — and these be qualities 
which do mightily assist a blind affection to 
C02en itself. I was wild — in troth I might go yet 
farther and say very wild, though ’twas a wildness 
of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, 
brought shame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any 
taint of crime or baseness, or what might not beseem 
mine honorable degree. 

“Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to 
good account — he seeing that our brother Arthur’s 
health was but indifferent, and hoping the worst 
might work him profit were I swept out of the path 
— so — but ’twere a long tale, good my liege, and 
little worth the telling. Briefly, then, this brother 
did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes; 
ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in 
mine apartments — conveyed thither by his own 
means — and did convince my father by this, and 
suborned evidence of servants and other lying 
knaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith 
and marry with her, in rank defiance of his will. 

“Three years of banishment from home and 
England might make a soldier and a man of me, my 
father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom. 
I fought out my long probation in the continental 
wars, tasting sumptuously of hard knocks, privation, 
and adventure; but in my last battle I was taken 
captive, and during the seven years that have waxed 
and waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath har- 
bored me. Through wit and courage I won to the 
free air at last, and fled hither straight; and am but 
just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and 
poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven 
years have wrought at Hendon Hall, its people and 
belongings. So please you, sir, my meager tale is 

“Thou hast been shamefully abused!” said the 
little king, with a flashing eya “But I will right 
thee — by the cross will I! The king hath said it.” 

Then, fired by the story of Miles’s wrongs, he 
loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own 
recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished 
listener. When he had finished, Miles said to him- 
self: 

“Lo, what an imagination he hath! Verily this 
is no common mind; else, crazed or sane, it could 
not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of 
the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this 
curious romaunt. Poor ruined little head, it shall 
not lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the 
living. He shall never leave my side; he shall be 
my pet, my little comrade. And he shall be cured! 
— aye, made whole and sound — then will he make 
himself a name — and proud shall I be to say, ‘Yes, 
he is mine — I took him, a homeless little rag amu ffin, 
but I saw what was in him, and I said his name 
would be heard some day — behold him, observe him 
— was I right?’ ” 

The king spoke — in a thoughtful, measured voice: 

“Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance 
my life, and so my crown. Such service demandeth 
rich reward. Name thy desire, and so it be within 
the compass of my royal power, it is thine.” 

This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of 
his reverie. He was about to thank the king and 
put the matter aside with saying he had only done 
his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought 
came into his head, and he asked leave to be silent 
a few moments and consider the gracious offer an 
idea which the king gravely approved, renwking 
that it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of 
such great import. 

Miles reflected during some moments, then said 
to himself, “Yes, that is the thing to do— by any 
other means it were impossible to get at it and 
certes, this hour’s experience has taught me ’twould 
be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as 
it is. Yes, I will propose it; ’twas a happy accident 
that I did not throw the chance away.” Then he 
dropped upon one knee and said: 

“My poor service went not beyond the limit of a 
subject’s simple duty, and therefore hath no merit; 
but since your majesty is pleased to hold it worthy 
some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition, 
to this effect. Near four hundred years ago, as 
your grace knoweth, there being ill blood betwixt 
John, king of England, and the king of France, it 
was decreed that two champions should fight to- 
gether in the lists, and so settle the dispute by what 
is called the arbitrament of God. These two kings, 
and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness 
and judge the conflict, the French champion ap- 
peared; but so redoubtable was he that our English 
knights refused to measure weapons with him. So 
the matter, which was a weighty one, was like to go 
against the English monarch by default. Now in 
the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest 
arm in England, stripped of his honom and posses- 
sions, and wasting with long captivity. Appeal was 
made to him; he gave assent, and came forth arrayed
for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman 
glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous na.mp. 
but he fled away, and the French king’s cause was 
lost. King John restored De Courcy’s titles and 
possessions, and said, ‘Name thy wish and thou 
shalt have it, though it cost me half my kingdom’; 
whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made 
answer, ‘This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my 
successors may have and hold the privilege of re- 
maining covered in the presence of the kings of 
England, henceforth while the throne shah, last.’ 
The boon was granted, as your majesty knoweth; 
and there hath been no time, these four hundred 
years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, 
even unto this day, the head of that ancient house 
still weareth his hat or helm before the king’s 
majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none 
other may do. Invoking this precedent in aid of 
my prayer, I beseech the king to grant to me but 
this one grace and privilege — to my more than 
sufficient reward — and none other, to wit: that I 
and my heirs, forever, may sit in the presence of 
the majesty of England!” 

“Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, knight,” said the king, 
gravely — giving the accolade with Hendon’s sword 
— “rise, and seat thyself. Thy petition is granted. 
While England remains, and the crown continues, 
the privilege shall not lapse.” 

His majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon 
dropped into a chair at table, observing to himself, 

The lords of Emgsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this 
curious privilege. 

' ’Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought me a 
mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. 
An I had not thought of that, I must have had to 
stand for weeks, till my poor lad’s wits are cured.” 
After a little he went on, “And so I am become a 
knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! 
A most odd and strange position, truly, for one so 
matter-of-fact as I. I will not laugh — no, God 
forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to 
me is teal to him. And to me, also, in one way, it 
is not a falsity, for it reflects with truth the sweet 
and generous spirit that is in him.” After a pause: 
“Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title be- 
fore folk! — there’d be a merry contrast betwixt my 
glory and my raiment! But no matter; let him 
call me what he will, so it please him I shall be 
content.” 


CHAPTER XIII 


THE DISAPPEARANCE OP THE PRINCE 

A HEAVY drowsiness presently fell upon the two 
comrades. The king said; 

“Remove these rags” — meaning his clothing. 
Hendon disappareled the boy without dissent or 
remark, tucked him up in bed, then glanced about 
the room, saying to himself, ruefully, “He hath 
taken my bed again, as before — marry, what shall 
do?” The little king observed his perplexity, and 
dissipated it with a word. He said, sleepily: 

“Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard 
it.” In a moment more he was out of his troubles, 
in a deep slumber. 

“Dear heart, he should have been bom a king!” 
muttered Hendon, admiringly; “he playeth the part 
to a marvel.” 

Then he stretched himself across the door, on the 
floor, saying contentedly; 

“I have lodged worse for seven years; ’twould 
be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with 
this.” 

He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. Toward 
noon he rose, uncovered his imconsdous ward — a 
section at a time — and took his measure with a 
string. The king awoke, just as he had completed 

his work, complained of the cold, and asked what 
he was doing. 

“’Tis done now, my liege,” said Hendon; “I 
have a bit of business outside, but will presently
return; sleep thou again — thou needest it. There — 
let me cover thy head also — thou’lt be warm the 
sooner.” 

The king was back in dreamland before this 
speech was ended. Miles slipped softly out, and 
slipped as softly in again, in the course of thirty or 
forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of 
boy’s clothing, of cheap material, and showdng signs 
of wear; but tidy, and suited to the season of the 
year. He seated himself, and began to overhaul his 
purchase, mumbling to himself: 

“A longer purse would have got a better sort, 
but when one has not the long purse one must be 
content wnth what a short one may do — 

“‘There was a woman in our town. 

In our town did dwell’ — 

“He stirred, methinks — I must sing in a less 
thimderous key; ’tis not good to mar his sleep, with 
this journey before him and he so wearied out, poor 
chap. . . . This garment — ’tis well enough — a stitch 
here and another one there will set it aright. This 
other is better, albeit a stitch or two will not come 
amiss in it, likewise. . . . These be very good 

and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and 
dry — an odd new thing to him, belike, since he has 
doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and 
summers the same. . , . Would thread were bread, 


seeing one getteth a year’s sufficiency for a farthing, 
and such a brave big needle without cost, for mere 
love. Now shall I have the demon’s own time to 
thread it!” 

And so he had. He did as men have always 
done, and probably always will do, to the end of 
time — held the needle still, and tried to thrust the 
thread through the eye, which is the opposite of a 
woman’s way. Time and time again the thread 
missed the mark, going sometimes on one side of 
the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes 
doubling up against the shaft; but he was patient, 
having been through these experiences before, when 
he was soldiering. He succeeded at last, and took 
up the garment that had lain waiting, meantime, 
across his lap, and began his work. “The inn is 
paid — the breakfast that is to come, included — and 
there is where-withal left to buy a couple of donkeys 
and meet our little costs for the two or three days 
bet'wixt this and the plenty that awaits us at 
Hendon Hall — 

“‘Slie loved her hus’ — 

“Body o’ me! I have driven the needle under 
my nah! ... It matters little — ’tis not a novelty 
— yet ’tis not a convenience, neither. . . . We shall 
be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy 
troubles will vanish there, and like-wise thy sad dis- 
temper — 

“‘She loved her husband dearilee, 

But another man’ — 

“These be noble large stitches!” — holding the 
garment up and viewing it admiringly — “they have 
a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small 
stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mighty paltry 
and plebeian — 

“‘She loved her husband dearilee, 

But another man he loved she,’ — 

“Marry, ’tis done — a goodly piece of work, 
too, and wrought with expedition. Now will I 
wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him, 
and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard 
inn in Southwark and — be pleased to rise, my 
liege! — he answereth not — what ho, my liege! — 
of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a 
touch, sith his slumber is deaf to speech. What!” 

He threw back the covers — the boy was gone! 

He stared about him in speechless astonishment 
for a moment; noticed for the first time that his 
ward’s ragged raiment was also missing, then he 
began to rage and storm, and shout for the inn- 
keeper. At that moment a servant entered with the 
breakfast. 

“Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is 
come!” roared the man of war, and made so savage 
a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not 
find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and sur- 
prise. “Where is the boy?” 

In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave 
the information desired. 

“You were hardly gone from the place, your 
worship, when a youth came running and said it 
was your worship’s will that the boy come to you 
straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. I 
brought him thither; and when he woke the lad and 
gave his message, the lad did grumble some little 
for being disturbed ‘so early,’ as he called it, but 
straightway trussed on his rags and went with the 
youth, only saying it had been better manners that 
your worship came yourself, not sent a stranger — 
and so — ” 

“And so thou’rt a fool ! — a fool, and easily cozened 
— hang all thy breed! Yet mayhap no hurt is done. 
Possibly no harm is meant the boy. I will go fetch 
him. Make the table ready. Stay! the coverings 
of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them 
— happened that by accident?” 

“I know not, good your worship. I saw the 
youth meddle with them — he that came for the 
boy.” 

“Thousand deaths! ’twas done to deceive me — 
’tis plain ’twas done to gain time. Hark ye! Was 
that youth alone?” 

“All alone, your worship.” 

“Art sure?” 

“Sure, your worship.” 

“Collect thy scattered wits — bet hink thee—take 
time, man.” 

After a moment’s thought, the servant said: 

“When he came, none came with him; but now 
I remember me that as the two stepped into the 
throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged 
out from some near place; and just as he was join- 
ing them — ” 

“What thenf — out with it!” thundered the impatient 
Hendon, interrupting. 


“Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed 
them in, and I saw no more, being called by my 
master, who was in a rage because a joint that the 
scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all 
the saints to witness that to blame me for that mis- 
carriage were like holding the tmbom babe to judg- 
ment for sins com — ” 

“Out of my sight, idiot! Thy prating drives me 
mad! Hold! whither art flying? Canst not bide 
stni an instant? Went they toward Southwark?” 

“Even so, your worship — for, as I said before, 
as to that detestable joint, the babe unborn is no 
whit more blameless than — ” 

“Art here yet? And prating still? Vanish, lest 
I throttle thee!” The servitor vanished. Hendon 
followed after him, passed him, and plunged down 
the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, “’Tis 
that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son. I 
have lost thee, my poor little mad master — it is a 
bitter thought — and I had come to love thee so! 
No! by book and bell, not lost! Not lost, for I 
win ransack the land till I find thee again. Poor 
child, yonder is his breakfast — and mine, but I 
have no hunger now — so, let the rats have it — 
speed, speed! that is the word!” As he wormed 
his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the 
Bridge, he several times said to himself — clinging 
to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing 
one: “He grumbled, but he went — he went, yes, 
because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet 
lad — he would ne’er have done it for another, I 
know it well!” 



CHAPTER XIV 


‘LE ROI EST MORT — VIVE LE ROl” 

Toward daylight of the same morning, Tony 
Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened 
his eyes in the dark. He lay silent a few moments, 
trying to analyze his confused thoughts and impressions,
and get some sort of meaning out of them, 
then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but 
guarded voice: 

“I see it all, I see it all! Now God be thanked, 
I am, indeed, awake at last! Come, joy! vanish, 
sorrow! Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and 
hie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your 
unbelieving ears the wildest madcap dream that ever 
the spirits of night did conjure up to astonish the 
soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say! Bet!” . . . 

A dim form appeared at his side, and a voice 
said: 

“Wilt deign to deliver thy. commands?” 
“Commands? . . . Oh, woe is me, I know thy 
voice! Speak, thou — who am I?” 

“Thou? In sooth, yesternight wert thou the 
Prince of Wales, to-day art thou my most gracious 
liege, Edward, king of England.” 

Tom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring 
plaintively: 



“Alack, it was no dream! Go to thy rest, sweet 
sir — Cleave me to my sorrows.” 

Tom slept again, and after a time he had this 
pleasant dream. He thought it was summer and he 
%vas playing, all alone, in the fair meadow called 
Goodman’s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, 
with long red whiskers and a humped back, appeared 
to him suddenly and said, “Dig, by that stump.” 
He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies — 
wonderful riches! Yet this was not the best of it; 
for the dwarf said: 

“I know thee. Thou art a good lad and deserv- 
ing; thy distresses shall end, for the day of thy re- 
ward is come. Dig here every seventh day, and 
thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve 
bright new pennies. Tell none — keep the secret.” 

Then the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal 
Court with his prize, saying to himself, “Every 
night will I give my father a penny; he will think I 
begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more 
be beaten. One penny every week the good priest 
that teacheth me shall have; mother. Nan, and Bet 
the other fomr. We be done with hunger and 
rags now, done with fears and frets and savage 
usage.” 

In his dream he reached his sordid home all out 
of breath, but with eyes dancing with grateful en- 
thusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his mother’s 
lap and cried out: 

“They are for thee! — all of them, every one! — 
for thee and Nan and Bet — and honestly come by, 
not begged nor stolen!” 



The happy and astonished mother strained him to 
her breast and exclaimed: 

“It waxeth late — may it please your majesty to 
rise?” 

Ah, that was not the answer he was expecting. 
The dream had snapped asunder — he was awake. 

He opened his eyes — the richly clad First Lord 
of the Bedchamber was kneeling by his couch. The 
gladness of the lying dream faded away — the poor 
boy recognized that he was still a captive and a 
king. The room was filled with courtiers clothed in 
purple mantles — the mourning color — and with 
noble servants of the monarch. Tom sat up in bed 
and gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon 
this fine company. 

The weighty business of dressing began, and one 
courtier after another knelt and paid his court and 
offered to the little king his condolences upon his 
heavy loss, while the dressing proceeded. In the 
beginning, a shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry 
in Waiting, who passed it to the First Lord of the 
Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentle- 
man of the Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head 
Ranger of Windsor Forest, who passed it to the 
Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the 
Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who 
passed it to the Master of the Wardrobe, who passed 
it to Norroy Eing-at-Arms, who passed it to the 
Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief 
Steward of the Household, who passed it to the 
Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it to the 
Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to 


the Archbishop of Canterbury, who passed it to the 
First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took what was 
left of it and put it on Tom. Poor little wondering 
chap, it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire. 

Each garment in its turn had to go through this 
slow and solemn process; consequently Tom grew 
very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt 
an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw 
his long silken hose begin the journey down the line 
and knew that the end of the matter was drawing 
near. But he exulted too soon. The First Lord of 
the Bedchamber received the hose and was about 
to incase Tom’s legs in them, when a sudden flush 
invaded his face and he htuxiedly hustled the things 
back into the hands of the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury with an astounded look and a whispered, 
“See, my lord!”— pointing to a something con- 
nected with the hose. The Archbishop paled, then 
flushed, and passed the hose to the Lord High Admiral,
whispering, “See, my lord!” The Admiral 
passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, 
and had hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate,
“See, my lord!” The hose drifted backward 
along the line, to the Chief Steward of the House- 
hold, the Constable of the Tower, Norroy Krng-at- 
Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe, the Chancellor 
Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom 
of the Stole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, 
the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber, the First 
Lord of the Buckhounds — accompanied always with 
that amazed and frightened “See! see!” — till they 
finally reached the hands of the Chief Equerry in 


'Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid face, 
upoa what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely 
whispered, “Body of my life, a tag gone from a 
truss point! — to the Tower with the Head Keeper 
of the King’s Hose!” — after which he leaned upon 
the shoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to 
regather his vanished strength while fresh hose, without 
any damaged strings to them, were brought. 

But all things must have an end, and so in time 
Tom Canty was in a condition to get out of bed. 
The proper official poured water, the proper official 
engineered the washing, the proper official stood by 
with a towel, and by and by Tom got safely through 
the purifying stage and was ready for the services of 
the Hairdresser-royal. When he at length emerged 
from his master’s hands, he was a gracious figure 
and as pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks 
of purple satin, and purple -plumed cap. He now 
moved in state toward his breakfast-room, through 
the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he 
passed, these fell back, leaving his way free, and 
dropped upon their knees. 

After breakfast he was conducted, with regal 
ceremony, attended by his great officers and his 
guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt 
battle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded 
to transact business of state. His “uncle,” Lord 
Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to assist the 
royal mind with wise counsel. 

The body of illustrious men named by the late 
king as his executors, appeared, to ask Tom’s ap- 
proval of certain acts of theirs — rather a form, and 
yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector 
as yet. The Archbishop of Canterbury made report 
of the decree of the Council of Executors concern- 
ing the obseqtdes of his late most illustrious majesty, 
and finished by reading the signatures of the execu- 
tors, to wit: the Archbishop of Canterbury; the 
Lord Chancellor of England; William Lord St. John; 
John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John 
Viscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham — 

Tom was not listening — an earlier clause of the 
document was puzzling him. At this point he 
turned and whispered to Lord Hertford; 

“What day did he say the burial hath been ap- 
pointed for?” 

“The 16th of the coming month, my liege.”
