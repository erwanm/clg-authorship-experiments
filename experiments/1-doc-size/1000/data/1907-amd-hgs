lines. To be made stronger.” 

“ Well, I think that pretty good. How 
many copies did you make ? ” 


 


“ Oh, five or six, parts of ones! ” 

“ Have you saved them? ” 

“ I’m not sure," hesitatingly. 

“ I'd like to see them. We will go to your 
room presently. I’m afraid you did weaken 
them, and you lost the fine temper of the old 
race.” 

“ You see it couldn’t be a translation ex- 
actly.” 

“ Yes, I understand. And I’ll tell you for 
consolation that I had some of my exercises 
too rough, at first." 

“ Oh ! ” There was a touch of joyous relief 
in the tone. 

“ You’ve had other exercises sent back? It 
is a kind of freshman’s luck, discipline. You 
are just beginning college relations. It’s dif- 
ferent from a governess, or even boarding- 
school. But the farther you go, the better you 
like it.” 

“If you didn't have to study so hard every 
day,” regretfully. 

“ Why, there is Saturday and Sunday,” 
smilingly. 

“ And I spent all last Saturday correcting 



and doing things over. The girls went in 
town and had a jolly time.” 

u One gets used to study,” comforted 
Helen. 

“ Didn’t you have any bad times?” was 
the almost reproachful inquiry. 

“ I guess I was a born student.” She saw 
herself again the little girl sitting on Mrs. 
Dayton’s stoop studying for a high school 
examination, and Mr. Warfield — where was 
he? Had he gained some of the things on 
which he had set his heart? 

She went over the fragments with Miss 
Chardavoyne, who had taken out several of 
the stronger adjectives, and really emasculated 
parts of lines. 

“ But it doesn’t sound so beautiful,” she 
said in a disappointed tone. 

“ Not to you, perhaps, but a professor views 
it with a different eye. Now send it in to- 
morrow and take the result philosophically.” 

“ If it is a better verdict, it will be owing to 
you.” 

And very encouraging it certainly was. For 
reward Helen received a poem in her honor 


that transformed her into a Greek goddess, 
with hands dropping gifts to her worshipper. 

Miss Brooks looked it over thoughtfully. 

“ Your modernity has spoiled it, Helen,” 
and she gave a soft laugh. “ It should be 
Strephon to Phyllis. Would she be annoyed 
if I were to ask her to recast it, and explain 
why? There are some real lovers’ sentiments 
in it. The Miscellany has not had anything 
like this in a long time. We have had autum- 
nal verses and climbing heights and dead flow- 
ers and blighting east winds. The only first- 
class thing was about the soldier who died on 
his march to the sea, you remember. It was 
copied in the Bedford Weekly 

“ Oh, do talk to her about it! And I wish 
she wouldn’t put me up on such a pedestal. I 
feel foolish." 

“ This is the penalty for ardent admiration. 
No girl ever fell in love with me to such an 
extent.’’ 

“ She may, presently. They fall desperately 
in love with Carol Saybrook, or she draws 
them by some occult process. Then — I don’t 
know whether she drains them dry, or tires of 



them, or longs for fresh fields — but she 
gently drops them. They are in her room 
sipping tea, chatting, examining her pretty ar- 
ticles, and then — they drop out and it is some 
one else. She is fascinating, I suppose, but not 
really lovable. Some girls are positive studies. 
It is a good thing, I dare say; it prepares you 
for the greater world. I think one learns not 
to expect so much and not to be so deeply 
disappointed in people." 

Miss Brooks asked the young poet to her 
room one evening, keeping herself at leisure, 
and laid before her a plan for the usefulness 
of the poem. 

“ But I didn't mean it for that,” Shirley 
protested. “ It was because — did you ever 
know of a girl falling in love with another 
girl?” and the pretty face flushed scarlet, the 
eyes were wistful with emotion. “ I love Miss 
Grant. I can’t tell you why, only I do. If I 
was boundlessly rich, I’d ask her to share my 
whole life; I'd lavish everything upon her as 
lovers do.” 

“You silly child!” The tone was soft, the 
smile had no irony in it. “ Sometime you 


will settle to a cordial liking for Miss Grant, 
and you may be excellent friends, but you must 
not waste all your energies dreaming about 
her. There are greater problems for you to 
wrestle with, for after all, I think you will not 
purposely bring disrespect upon college train- 
ing. Consider if you do not owe it attention, 
at least.” 

“ But I’m not going in for wisdom,” with 
a faint smile. “ Why, I couldn't understand 
some of the abstruse demands ! I don’t care 
about the grand system of the universe, for 
I shall live in only a little place, and I want 
to be happy and have some one — oh ! several 
people — love me and talk over things with 
me that I enjoy! And Plato and Aristotle — 
oh, yes ! I like the Phsedo, but I don’t under- 
stand it, and I don’t see what good it did to 
have Socrates die. I always want to cry over 
that.” 

“ And you had no real motive in coming to 
college ? ” 

“ Why — yes. I wanted to be with a great 
lot of girls. And I do like it ever so much. 
But Helen Grant is a bright particular star, 



so much above me in strength and knowledge 
that I can worship her without asking much 
back. Perhaps I can’t make you understand. 
I used to try with Eloise, but you see she had 
a lover and thought that was the only thing 
to life, and her ideal was having a pretty 
home and making all manner of furnishings 
for it.” 

Reasoning with her at present would be in 
a circle. Leslie had never met just such a 
girl. She was not silly, though romantic. 

“To come back to the poem : Strephon is 
inditing it to Phyllis among the flowery 
meads, and she must answer instead of dream- 
ing.” 

“ But Phyllis — ” and the girl colored scar- 
let. “ It is such a darkey name. Helen is 
strong and splendid.” 

“ And they are both Grecian. Let us see 
now. Sit down here.” 

She took her pencil and crossed out some 
lines, writing on the margin what she would 
like substituted. 

“ You are very musical,” she said. “ And 
you know a busy senior going in for some of 

the honors wouldn't spend her time over a 
freshman unless she thought there was some- 
thing to her. You must take that for a com- 
pliment. Now dream this out to-night, or 
to-morrow night, and give it to me Saturday 
morning. If you want to save your Helen 
copy intact, do so, and five years from this 
read it over and tell me what you think of it 
then.” 

Shirley gave a long sigh. 

“ I really do want the copy of Phyllis,” and 
the tone was persuasive, almost entreating. 

“ You are very good.'’ Shirley’s voice 
trembled a little, and the humid softness came 
into her eyes, as she passed out of the 
room. 

“ I do wonder if it was wise,” Miss Brooks 
ruminated. “ There are so many half-fledged 
poets in the world, so many who can write an 
averagely good story or essay, and yet never 
come up to any eminence. But they marry, 
and happily that settles it. Only it is really 
funny that her star of light should be Helen.” 

Saturday morning the editors of the Mis- 
cellany sat in solemn conclave. Essays had 



been chosen, there were two bright stories, 
some excellent jokes. 

“ There is one really good poem. Here are 
four that run in the same strain. I wonder 
if old Mother Nature ever gets tired of hear- 
ing herself praised. There’s a space for four 
verses, four lines each. Two of these are too 
long. Girls, I’m never going to edit a paper 
or a magazine, if I go out washing for my 
daily bread and a bottle of olives. I’m dis- 
gusted.” 

“ Read this aloud,” said Miss Brooks. “ Let 
us hear how it sounds.” 

Miss Cairns took the paper, skimmed it 
over, and then read the poem in a very ex- 
pressive voice. The staff had been leaning 
their elbows on the table, but at the second 
verse they straightened up, and began to pay 
attention. A silence followed, and they 
glanced at each other like a party of conspira- 
tors. 

“ Where did you unearth that, Miss Brooks? 
Is it truly original, or copied out of some vol- 
ume of old poems? It is charming and so 
melodious. Why — ” in great surprise. 



“Oh, Miss Brooks did it! It is the expir- 
ing effort of genius before she bids a final 
adieu to her Alma Mater. Confess now ! ” 
exclaimed the secretary. 

“ I cannot tell a lie, even to win fame, and 
I have no hatchet to back me up,” Leslie re- 
joined, laughingly. 

“ Well — it’s good and it goes in. Its 
freshness is a godsend. Our poets have fallen 
into a rut, or else they are working to win the 
prize. It smacks of groves, long since de- 
serted by simple-minded lovers, and turned 
into factories or oil refineries where Strephon 
gets soiled and coarse. Is it original? De- 
ceive me at your peril.” 

“I saw it cast and recast; I hammered at 
the poet until she brought it into shape; and 
it is from a freshman.” 

“ Oh, I can guess! The girl with the long 
light curls, tied up gracefully, who always 
looks as if she was posing. I heard her talk- 
ing one day about the impalpable, the in- 
tangible, and what not. She never used a 
short word where a trisyllable could be made 
to do duty.” 



“ Blit this hasn’t a long word in it. The 
very simplicity is charming. You are sure 
you can answer for it, Leslie?” 

kk Ouite certain, since I saw it rewritten a 
time or two, and much changed.” 

“ I like that better. I haven't much faith 
in these things dashed off in a moment, un- 
less the writer has been shaped up by years 
of practice and experience. Thank you, Leslie, 
for your discovery. How everybody will be 
guessing. This month’s Miscellany has been 
the trial of my life. Only four more, three 
for real work, one may say.” 

“ O dear ! Think how soon some of us will 
be going different ways. College spoils you, 
after all. You get so used to cloistered shades 
— that sounds poetical, doesn’t it? And now, 
Leslie, before we get lugubrious, tell us about 
your discovery.” 

“It was Helen Grant’s, rather than mine; 
a Miss Shirley Chardavoyne, freshman, Vir- 
ginian, a slim, rather pretty girl, with large, 
dark, moving eyes, as if she implored you not 
to judge her too harshly.” 

“ Well, I suppose she is a genius. She isn’t 


much of a scholar, and is the trial of Miss 
Van Meter’s morning. I’ve seen her with 
Miss Grant.” 

“ Girls, when the maga. is out we must give 
her a little spread. I wonder if she will do 
anything else as good. Oh, do you remember 
Rose Harding, who wrote those curiously 
weird poems, and last year’s chief lauded her 
to the skies ? And then they found them more 
or less plagiarisms.’’ 

“ She came from a Western college. Per- 
haps she had done it there.” 

“ Well, we can be dismissed. The last 
pages may go to the printer's hands. Oh, 
compeers, I suppose some time in the future 
we will take out our old Miscellanies and give 
a sigh for the happy days together, forgetting 
the infelicities, the tears, and heart-breaks, the 
withering comments, the midnight headaches 
near the close of the year! I’d just as leave 
live it all over again. Vale! vale!” and she 
rose waving her hand. 

Leslie took the pleasant news to Helen. 
“ But you are not to say a word until she sees 
it in print. And she is to have a welcome in 



the charmed circle afterward. I wish she 
cared more for scholarship.” 

“ The sophomores insist that I should go on 
their sleigh-ride, and I have consented. I 
begged an invitation for her.” 

“ Go off and have a good time. Next year, 
you will be full of anxieties." 

“ If I should pass,” laughing. 

“ As you will, if you don't waste too much 
time. But one has a curious feeling when one 
faces the fact that it is all over.” 

There were three big sleighs, and the girls 
crowded in, sitting on the straw between the 
knees of those on the seats. It was a fine 
sunny afternoon with a crisp air. Great sheets 
of unbroken snow sparkled like diamond fields, 
as the last of the storm had been fine rain and 
sleet. They were merry enough, singing col- 
lege songs, and yet a strange pensiveness per- 
vaded Helen. This year was different; there 
was a greater intellectual seriousness, indi- 
vidual preference for qualities that attracted 
her, instead of a sort of general approval that 
she had considered a duty. She was almost 
sorry she had skipped a year. 



Tired and sleepy from the change of out-of- 
doors air to the drowsy warmth, she went 
straight to her room after chapel. There were 
several letters. She saved Willard Bell's 
until the last. Truth to tell, she felt a little 
piqued at his long silence. He often wrote 
two letters to her one, and she had waited 
some time. She had not wanted to invite him 
for Christmas. 

The letter was dated at New Orleans. The 
senior partner of the firm had been called 
thither to disentangle a matter in which there 
was a large amount of money, as well as tracts 
of real estate that had long been in litigation. 
Willard had been asked to go as secretary and 
stenographer, and he hoped before his return 
to get to Bermuda. The news from Daisy was 
not encouraging. There had been some talk 
of German baths, but the doctor had forbidden 
any journeying about. They were delightfully 
situated, and had met some friends — indeed, 
there was coming and going continually. And 
Laurence Hollis had accepted a call to a pretty, 
old, new town, Vernon Park, where there was 
much culture and refinement, the beautiful old 


ways holding their own against the new. 
There was a select academy for girls, a fine 
library that had been donated by several pub- 
lic-spirited citizens, a stone church that had 
lately been renewed, but not spoiled, and a 
most cosy rectory. The clergyman of the last 
twenty years had insisted on retiring from 
active life. Mr. Hollis would go shortly after 
Christmas, was probably there now, and they 
would be delightfully situated. It was just 
the thing for Marjorie, the nice society where 
her accomplishments would not be allowed to 
rust. The mission station had been very well 
to try one’s prentice hand on, but Hollis could 
come up to finer heights. And they would not 
be very far from the Townes, who were re- 
joicing in a little son. 

Then there were pages about the old city 
that was still half-French and Spanish. It was 
such a bright friendly letter, so little about his 
feelings, but full of enjoyment, that Helen's 
heart some way warmed to him as it had not 
done in a long while. She must write to him; 
he could not tell when he should be back, and 
he might take a trip to Bermuda. Travelling 


about was one of the most inspiriting enjoy- 
ments. 

How the days flew by! Easter was begin- 
ning to be talked about. There were two con- 
certs with their practice, Easter Sunday music, 
and the glee club. They all said, “ Oh, we 
want your voice! ” And after Easter the out- 
of-door pleasures would begin. Helen was 
hungry for green and growing things ; the 
pines and firs and hemlocks seemed unsym- 
pathetic in their winter garb. But oh, there 
were tough exercises and problems to wrestle 
with, and girls to help out of the Slough of 
Despond ! She wondered sometimes why girls 
who had so much in their lives should get blue 
and despondent when they could study. Of 
course there were indifferent girls who were 
not anxious about their record and who never 
expected to be seniors. 

If she had written the verses herself, Helen 
could not have been so full of satisfaction as 
when she saw Shirley’s poem in print. One 
of the rules was that no name was attached 
to the articles. They were guessed at, and ad- 


mitted afterward, and every contributor had 
a right to claim her own. 

“ Why, this suggests some of the old Eng- 
lish poets,” said a senior. “ It is dainty and 
sweet, a perfect pastoral. Is it Ray Stannard, 
think ? Once in about three months, she has 
a delicious inspiration.” 

“ And she has sense enough not to cudgel 
her brain between whiles. Poets can’t be ham- 
mered out like gold leaf ; they get too awfully 
thin.” 

Helen took the paper to Miss Chardavoyne’s 
room and found her in tears over two returned 
exercises. One had the two black diagonal 
lines, and was good for nothing; the other 
began well, but two-thirds had to be gone 
over. 

“ Oh, I am so glad to see you!” She 
sprang up and flung her arms about Helen’s 
neck impulsively, laid her head in the arch be- 
tween cheek and shoulder, and cried, to the 
detriment of Helen’s fresh stock. 

“ I can’t do it ! I can’t ! Will I be sent 
home in disgrace, I wonder? And I’ve come 
to like it so. I’ve heard of high-up schools 


where they took parlor boarders; isn’t there 
any such thing in colleges? I tried and tried 
over those geometry problems until I felt my- 
self turning into all kinds of many-sided things 
and my brain nearly burst. Not one of them 
was right. Are there not some people who 
can’t learn certain things? And what use will 
they be to me? ” 

“ Do not take it so hard. Was nothing well 
done?” asked Helen, in a cool, tranquillizing 
tone. 

“ Oh, that about Greek art ! But you see, 
I really love that. And then the Anabasis, but 
I’d read the translations so much; only I’m 
not very expert in Greek writing. And French 
grammar was ‘ Passable. Go over again.’ 
I’m willing to stay in the freshman class, if 
I only squeeze through, but they were talk- 
ing last night about girls that had been 
dropped.” 

“ We will go over the geometry. It is hard 
for an unmathematical brain,” smiling. 

Shirley began to mop up her eyes. “ You’re 
my good angel, and yet you refuse the adora- 
tion I can offer. Even the Greek gods were 


not so cruel as that,” and a gleam of sunshine 
began to break over the child-face. 

“ Here is something that may comfort you. 
I think it a great compliment. I had one 
article in my freshman year, and one this De- 
cember. You may do quite as well.” 

She began with a puzzled look, glanced at 
Helen incredulously, then read on, and a radi- 
ance illumined her countenance, her lips quiv- 
ered, her eyes grew moist, it seemed, with both 
pain and pleasure struggling in them. 

“ They are my verses and they aren’t. It’s 
the poem you and Miss Brooks made me write. 
And I'd rather have mine to you, for that 
came from my very heart. You see, I don’t 
care what Strephon said to Phyllis; they’re 
not my people at all. They don’t touch my 
soul. Is it the soul that enjoys? Since that 
lesson in physiology about the heart and the 
circulation, you can’t have a bit of romance 
about it, or really believe any sentiment comes 
out of it. Science is just going to spoil every- 
thing beautiful in life,” she said, in a dissatis- 
fied, complaining tone. 




 

“ And you are not a bit grateful for this 
compliment?”  

“Oh! is it a compliment?” She looked 
bewildered. 

“ I suppose you never had anything printed 
before? ” 

“ Why, no ! I never dreamed any one 
would care until I could write something really 
splendid. I didn't suppose any one would 
want to print a little thing like that! It isn't 
as fine as that first one.” 

“ But you see general readers are not so 
much interested in personal admiration.” 

“ Why, I didn't care to have any one know 
it, but just you. That was the charm.” 

“ You are a little dear! ” exclaimed Helen, 
warmly, touched by the abnegation of self. 
“ Some day, if you cultivate your talent, you 
will understand all these necessary points that 
give delicate flavors. And when you have a 
lover, he may be glad of this poetic adoration.” 

“ If one could write Portuguese sonnets to 
him! But he would have to be Browning to 
inspire one.” 

What a curious compound she was. Was it 


real genius? Helen’s knowledge of geniuses 
was limited. 

“Well — what am I to do? Go to these 
magazine people and thank them on my 
bended knees ? " 

A sense of mirth quivered about her rosy 
lips. She had the sunny temper of a June day, 
and the drifts of wounds or hurts dissolved 
like the airy clouds in the sky. 

“No. You will no doubt hear from the 
editorial corps. And now if you can come 
down to every-day, troublesome things, sup- 
pose we look at the geometry.” 

“Oh, please do not think me ungrateful! 
It was a lovely thing for you and Miss Brooks 
to do, and I do not know what to say,” in 
bewilderment. 

“ Then let us devote the known and un- 
known quantities to problems.” 


CHAPTER VIII 


IN A STRAIT BETWIXT TWO 

Miss Chardavoyne was cordially invited 
to Miss M inturn’s room to a tea at eight 
o’clock on Tuesday evening. She came to 
Helen with the note in her hand. 

“ Miss Minturn is editor-in-chief of the 
Miscellany , and we are all sure she will be on 
the honor list, and no doubt have one of the 
essays. Of course, it is about the poem." 

“ But I am frightened. I don't know any 
of the high-up girls, except Miss Brooks and 
a Miss Weeks who came from Petersburg. 
And — what am I expected to do ? Oh, can 
you go? ” 

“ Of course, your sponsors will be there,” 
replied Helen, laughing in a pleasant, friendly 
manner. “ And you have only to be your 
natural self; it is no formidable ordeal. The 
seniors make a good deal of allowance. They 



have been on the foundation lines them- 
selves.” 

“And how shall I dress?” 

“ Wear something pretty and poetic. You 
have a soft, pale green gown that makes you 
look like a naiad, only I believe they have 
yellow hair.” 

Shirley had an incomprehensible fit of shy- 
ness as she entered. Miss Minturn’s room was 
quite large and handsomely furnished with the 
trophies of four years of college life. She was 
rather tall, with fine contours, and had been 
a renowned athlete in her junior days, but she 
smiled out of clear, hazel eyes as she proffered 
her hand to Shirley and then introduced her 
to the assembled group. 

There was a touch of arch, deprecating 
sweetness in the young girl’s face, and grace 
being her birthright, even the strangeness did 
not make her awkward. 

“ We are so glad to discover you,” began 
Miss Minturn. “ I had no idea those charm- 
ing verses were from so young a poet. I hope 
you will fulfil the promise given in them, but 


 

you must remember that the climb up Parnas- 
sus is rather steep.” 

“ Maybe it is best not to keep your eyes 
fixed on the very top, you might get dizzy. 
And the meadows and fields have the most 
bloom and the warmest welcome. I am not 
so ambitious; I should only care to write for 
those ” — who appreciate me, she was about 
to say, but hesitated and substituted, “ liked 
me.” 

“ The modesty of a true poet. Come over 
here; I want to talk to you — ” 

“ She goes round the circle first,” inter- 
rupted Miss Minturn. “ She is the guest of 
honor this evening, and you cannot monopolize 
her and drain her dry. It will not make a 
poet of you,” laughed the hostess. 

“ Surely I am content to be the plain prose 
of this august body. But if some day you 
should see me amassing a fortune by writing 
advertisements, how you will regret having 
flouted me in my unsophisticated youth.” 

“ Hear! hear! ” and another rapped on the 
table. 

Shirley made the rounds of the young 



women, who did not seem so formidable after 
all. Their laughs precluded all idea of stiff- 
ness. She seated herself next to Helen, but 
the girl who had spoken for her came over and 
pushed her companion on the other side a little, 
squeezing herself in beside her. 

“ I am always anxious to know how verses 
are written," she began, in a complaining tone, 
as if she had been wronged out of some quali- 
fication. “ I have a long list of words that 
rhyme, but the puzzle is to get the beautiful 
ideas to go in between. College ought to sup- 
ply them, but it doesn’t." 

Shirley looked amazed an instant, then the 
face above her softened to a smile and set the 
girl at ease. She felt at once the atmosphere 
of refinement, instead of the crudeness of the 
freshmen; it was of the quality she had been 
accustomed to and was native air. 

She had lived and revelled in poetry. No, 
she had never been away from home except 
on visits, and she was not quite sure how much 
she liked college. If it was not for the awful 
tasks! Oh, she wrote the things that came 
to her, but she had never thought of having 


them praised ! Her father considered two or 
three verses of no account; just a whiff of a 
passing breeze. 

“ Did he set you at reading ponderous Mil- 
ton ?” asked another of the seniors. “It 
would be harnessing a butterfly to a cart.” 

“ But I liked L’ Allegro,” she interposed. 
“ Father hasn’t much opinion of a girl’s in- 
tellect, and thinks he doesn't care for women's 
books, but he reads George Eliot. He took up 
Greek with me, but was disgusted. I revel in 
the translations, but I think I shall not go 
on with the language, French is so much 
easier.” 

“ But about the verses. I’m interested in 
the beginning of things, in the first exquisite 
thrill — ” 

“ Oh, stop your nonsense and don’t tease 
the child! Your poem was dainty and lovely, 
new and fresh, and we were glad to have it. 
You might venture upon another if you can 
do as well.” 

“ If you were older and wiser we might 
accuse you of knowing about Strephon under 
another name. Did some one tell you a 



charming love-story, or did you just imagine 
it?” asked another. 

Shirley turned a bewitching rose color. 
Helen’s heart came up in her throat lest Shir- 
ley should overstep discretion, but the regard 
for her ideal was too sacred to be brought out 
to promiscuous eyes. 

Miss Minturn made some tea that diffused 
a fragrance through the room, and brought 
out a few dainties. Her china was the envy 
of more than one, and she didn't always dis- 
play her rarest cups that had been sent her 
from many quarters of the globe. To-night 
she was generous. They drank to Miss Char- 
davoyne’s future success; they passed best 
wishes around, and if there was a famine in 
the absolute wisdom that might be supposed to 
emanate from seniors who were on their way 
to degrees, it was made up by the outflow of 
fun and jests that were cast around with the 
harmlessness of confetti. 

The good night was most cordial. Leslie 
and Helen escorted their guest to her hall. 

“ It was just charming, like the evenings 
mamma sometimes tells about. After the first. 


I didn’t feel at all afraid, though they must 
all be wise young women if they can pass those 
awful examinations. I was looking over the 
official circular and I’m glad I didn’t start to 
go through. I should get buried in oceans of 
knowledge that would never be the slightest 
good to me. You have both been lovely, and 
I thank you.” 

“ She is a rather curious compound, and 
certainly is well-bred and charmingly modest. 
Why, she didn't seem at all elated by the com- 
pliments and the interest that would have 
given some girls an attack of mental vertigo ! 
I wish Lorraine had been here.” 

Helen echoed that. A few days later they 
heard from her. The pneumonia had not been 
severe, but she was to go to Florida for several 
weeks. It was too bad to lose all that time 
and to be out a year. 

Helen missed her very much. There were 
other friends, to be sure, but she was learning 
that the interchange of thought and feeling, 
or even the commonplaces of an intimate ac- 
quaintance, took a good deal of time. She 
was willing to be helpful, but there were girls 



who drained one, who took all, and gave noth- 
ing back. 

Easter came with its glorious rejoicing, its 
grand music, its other side of college, tests and 
games, and now the strain began for the ex- 
aminations. The commencement exercises 
were discussed, the grand field-day, the finals. 
The girls wondered who would win the fresh- 
man prize; half a dozen girls were in hot 
competition. Then the juniors had one to be 
awarded for the best essay on Shakespeare. 
Helen had wondered whether she should try. 
She had made some notes. 

But one afternoon she was summoned to 
the students’ parlor and surprised at the sight 
of Willard Bell. His grave face shocked her, 
and the black gloves he held in his hand struck 
a chill to her heart. 

“Daisy!” she cried. 

“ Our dear Daisy has been brought home 
for the last time. They reached the city this 
morning, and will leave for the burial to-mor- 
row. I did not see her alive, but she was so 
changed that I could hardly make our pretty 
darling out of her. And she was so resolved 



to get better she would not hear a word of 
dying. So young, and with everything to live 
for ! She really did seem better a fortnight 
before she went, then suddenly she dropped 
down. I was on my way to New York, and 
there father met me with the sad news. Then, 
as I said, mother and Mr. Duer returned with 
the body. And now they want you. You 
seem to take Daisy's place in father’s heart, 
and you must not refuse him. Mother wishes 
it, too. There is a train by which we can 
reach the city at ten if you can get ready in 
an hour.” 

Helen made an effort to speak, but her 
throat filled up and her eyes were heavy with 
pain, rather than tears. It seemed heartless 
not to have been thinking through all these 
weeks of Daisy, the radiant, eager, wilful little 
queen. Had her marriage been very happy, 
Helen wondered. Had Mr. Duer been with 
her all the winter ? 

“ We cannot take no, Helen." Willard rose 
as he said this. He seemed taller, more manly, 
with a much more vivid personality and 
strength than she had credited him with be- 



fore. Yes, he had improved, in some inde- 
scribable manner he had gone beyond her ; she 
felt that. 

“Oh!” she cried, “I cannot tell you! I 
cannot express my sorrow ! I have somehow 
been afraid of the end, but it did not seem so 
near. And we were such friends in our girl- 
hood — at school — ” 

She had uttered this in broken sentences, 
and as the old memories rushed over her, the 
tears flowed. 

“Yes; mother was very anxious you 
should come. There were some messages and 
— and gifts. Oh, they both want to see you 
so ! Father is fairly heart-broken.” Then he 
took out his watch. “ There is only an hour,” 
wistfully. “ Will you get ready? ” 

There was a certain sound of gentle author- 
ity in his voice. Yes; she must go. Fortu- 
nately she had her thesis ready, her study of 
governments was almost completed and would 
not have to be sent in under a fortnight, and 
Goethe’s “ Egmont ” with Schiller’s sketch of 
Egmont’s life — oh, she could soon catch up 



in the few matters, but they must not be con- 
sidered just now! Love and duty both called. 

“ Then you must excuse me while I make 
arrangements,” she said in a low tone, the 
traces of tears still in her eyes as she glanced 
up, and his were bent upon her with a new 
tenderness. 

There were professors to see, explanations 
to be made, and to Miss Brooks she rehearsed 
a little of the story. 

“ Oh, wasn't that your friend’s admirer? I 
remember now ; they were at commencement. 
And a schoolmate. Is it the first break in 
your ranks of friendship? You are a fortu- 
nate girl. Yes; I'll see to the loose ends. And 
you’ll be sure to come back in time to finish 
your work.” 

“ By Monday, at the latest,” returned 
Helen, with her good-by. “ Tell Miss Char- 
davoyne how it was. She is at recitation. 
And tell some of the others.” 

Less than two years ago she had taken the 
same journey with Willard at Daisy’s impera- 
tive summons. The pretty, sweet, captious 
lips were silent now ; they would never speak 



again. It was dreadful to go out of the world 
in youth. She could not imagine any one being 
even reconciled at that period. Death seemed 
for old age. And how few she had cared for 
had gone out of her life ! One was her first 
friend, Mrs. Van Dorn, and that memory had 
been sweetened by time. 

Willard was most attentive in an unobtru- 
sive way. How manly he had grown ; the
