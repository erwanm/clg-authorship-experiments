when they went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep
which follows an orgy.

Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys. We were not overmuch pestered with
schooling. Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere
the Virgin, the Church, and the saints above everything. Beyond these
matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed
to. Knowledge was not good for the common people, and could make them
discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God
would not endure discontentment with His plans. We had two priests. One
of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much
considered.

There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf,
but there was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn
and awful respect. This was because he had absolutely no fear of the
Devil. He was the only Christian I have ever known of whom that could
be truly said. People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for
they thought that there must be something supernatural about him, else
he could not be so bold and so confident. All men speak in bitter
disapproval of the Devil, but they do it reverently, not flippantly;
but Father Adolf’s way was very different; he called him by every name
he could lay his tongue to, and it made every one shudder that heard
him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly;
then the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his
presence, fearing that something fearful might happen.

Father Adolf had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and
defied him. This was known to be so. Father Adolf said it himself. He
never made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was
speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that
occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle
at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch
where it struck and broke.

But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and
were sorriest for. Some people charged him with talking around in
conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all
his poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was
never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of
character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and
truthful. He wasn’t charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the
congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it
is easy for enemies to manufacture  that . Father Peter had an enemy
and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old
tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars. Every
one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so
hard, for there was always a war and generally a famine somewhere. But
he could also read any man’s life through the stars in a big book he
had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father
Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil,
had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our
village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with
stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have
magic power. The bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer,
it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the
astrologer made a great show of piety, which would impress the bishop,
of course.

But Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer. He denounced him
openly as a charlatan--a fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind,
or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior human being,
which naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to
ruin him. It was the astrologer, as we all believed, who originated
the story about Father Peter’s shocking remark and carried it to the
bishop. It was said that Father Peter had made the remark to his niece,
Marget, though Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe
her and spare her old uncle from poverty and disgrace. But the bishop
wouldn’t listen. He suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he
wouldn’t go so far as to excommunicate him on the evidence of only one
witness; and now Father Peter had been out a couple of years, and our
other priest, Father Adolf, had his flock.

Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget. They had been
favorites, but of course that changed when they came under the shadow
of the bishop’s frown. Many of their friends fell away entirely, and
the rest became cool and distant. Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen
when the trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and
the most in it. She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and
pocket money by her own industry. But her scholars fell off one by one
now; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the
youth of the village; the young fellows stopped coming to the house,
all except Wilhelm Meidling--and he could have been spared; she and
her uncle were sad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace, and the
sunshine was gone out of their lives. Matters went worse and worse, all
through the two years. Clothes were wearing out, bread was harder and
harder to get. And now, at last, the very end was come. Solomon Isaacs
had lent all the money he was willing to put on the house, and gave
notice that to-morrow he would foreclose.




CHAPTER II


Three of us boys were always together, and had been so from the cradle,
being fond of one another from the beginning, and this affection
deepened as the years went on--Nikolaus Bauman, son of the principal
judge of the local court; Seppi Wohlmeyer, son of the keeper of the
principal inn, the “Golden Stag,” which had a nice garden, with shade
trees reaching down to the riverside, and pleasure boats for hire; and
I was the third--Theodor Fischer, son of the church organist, who was
also leader of the village musicians, teacher of the violin, composer,
tax-collector of the commune, sexton, and in other ways a useful
citizen, and respected by all. We knew the hills and the woods as well
as the birds knew them; for we were always roaming them when we had
leisure--at least, when we were not swimming or boating or fishing, or
playing on the ice or sliding down hill.

And we had the run of the castle park, and very few had that. It was
because we were pets of the oldest serving-man in the castle--Felix
Brandt; and often we went there, nights, to hear him talk about old
times and strange things, and to smoke with him (he taught us that)
and to drink coffee; for he had served in the wars, and was at the
siege of Vienna; and there, when the Turks were defeated and driven
away, among the captured things were bags of coffee, and the Turkish
prisoners explained the character of it and how to make a pleasant
drink out of it, and now he always kept coffee by him, to drink himself
and also to astonish the ignorant with. When it stormed he kept us
all night; and while it thundered and lightened outside he told us
about ghosts and horrors of every kind, and of battles and murders and
mutilations, and such things, and made it pleasant and cozy inside; and
he told these things from his own experience largely. He had seen many
ghosts in his time, and witches and enchanters, and once he was lost in
a fierce storm at midnight in the mountains, and by the glare of the
lightning had seen the Wild Huntsman rage on the blast with his specter
dogs chasing after him through the driving cloud-rack. Also he had seen
an incubus once, and several times he had seen the great bat that sucks
the blood from the necks of people while they are asleep, fanning them
softly with its wings and so keeping them drowsy till they die.

He encouraged us not to fear supernatural things, such as ghosts, and
said they did no harm, but only wandered about because they were lonely
and distressed and wanted kindly notice and compassion; and in time we
learned not to be afraid, and even went down with him in the night to
the haunted chamber in the dungeons of the castle. The ghost appeared
only once, and it went by very dim to the sight and floated noiseless
through the air, and then disappeared; and we scarcely trembled, he had
taught us so well. He said it came up sometimes in the night and woke
him by passing its clammy hand over his face, but it did him no hurt;
it only wanted sympathy and notice. But the strangest thing was that he
had seen angels--actual angels out of heaven--and had talked with them.
They had no wings, and wore clothes, and talked and looked and acted
just like any natural person, and you would never know them for angels
except for the wonderful things they did which a mortal could not do,
and the way they suddenly disappeared while you were talking with them,
which was also a thing which no mortal could do. And he said they were
pleasant and cheerful, not gloomy and melancholy, like ghosts.

It was after that kind of a talk one May night that we got up next
morning and had a good breakfast with him and then went down and
crossed the bridge and went away up into the hills on the left to
a woody hill-top which was a favorite place of ours, and there we
stretched out on the grass in the shade to rest and smoke and talk over
these strange things, for they were in our minds yet, and impressing
us. But we couldn’t smoke, because we had been heedless and left our
flint and steel behind.

Soon there came a youth strolling toward us through the trees, and he
sat down and began to talk in a friendly way, just as if he knew us.
But we did not answer him, for he was a stranger and we were not used
to strangers and were shy of them. He had new and good clothes on, and
was handsome and had a winning face and a pleasant voice, and was easy
and graceful and unembarrassed, not slouchy and awkward and diffident,
like other boys. We wanted to be friendly with him, but didn’t know how
to begin. Then I thought of the pipe, and wondered if it would be taken
as kindly meant if I offered it to him. But I remembered that we had
no fire, so I was sorry and disappointed. But he looked up bright and
pleased, and said:

“Fire? Oh, that is easy; I will furnish it.”

I was so astonished I couldn’t speak; for I had not said anything.
He took the pipe and blew his breath on it, and the tobacco glowed
red, and spirals of blue smoke rose up. We jumped up and were going
to run, for that was natural; and we did run a few steps, although
he was yearningly pleading for us to stay, and giving us his word
that he would not do us any harm, but only wanted to be friends with
us and have company. So we stopped and stood, and wanted to go back,
being full of curiosity and wonder, but afraid to venture. He went on
coaxing, in his soft, persuasive way; and when we saw that the pipe did
not blow up and nothing happened, our confidence returned by little and
little, and presently our curiosity got to be stronger than our fear,
and we ventured back--but slowly, and ready to fly at any alarm.

He was bent on putting us at ease, and he had the right art; one could
not remain doubtful and timorous where a person was so earnest and
simple and gentle, and talked so alluringly as he did; no, he won us
over, and it was not long before we were content and comfortable and
chatty, and glad we had found this new friend. When the feeling of
constraint was all gone we asked him how he had learned to do that
strange thing, and he said he hadn’t learned it at all; it came natural
to him--like other things--other curious things.

“What ones?”

“Oh, a number; I don’t know how many.”

“Will you let us see you do them?”

“Do--please!” the others said.

“You won’t run away again?”

“No--indeed we won’t. Please do. Won’t you?”

“Yes, with pleasure; but you mustn’t forget your promise, you know.”

We said we wouldn’t, and he went to a puddle and came back with water
in a cup which he had made out of a leaf, and blew upon it and
threw it out, and it was a lump of ice the shape of the cup. We were
astonished and charmed, but not afraid any more; we were very glad to
be there, and asked him to go on and do some more things. And he did.
He said he would give us any kind of fruit we liked, whether it was in
season or not. We all spoke at once:

“Orange!”

“Apple!”

“Grapes!”

“They are in your pockets,” he said, and it was true. And they were of
the best, too, and we ate them and wished we had more, though none of
us said so.

“You will find them where those came from,” he said, “and everything
else your appetites call for; and you need not name the thing you wish;
as long as I am with you, you have only to wish and find.”

And he said true. There was never anything so wonderful and so
interesting. Bread, cakes, sweets, nuts--whatever one wanted, it was
there. He ate nothing himself, but sat and chatted, and did one curious
thing after another to amuse us. He made a tiny toy squirrel out of
clay, and it ran up a tree and sat on a limb overhead and barked down
at us. Then he made a dog that was not much larger than a mouse, and it
treed the squirrel and danced about the tree, excited and barking, and
was as alive as any dog could be. It frightened the squirrel from tree
to tree and followed it up until both were out of sight in the forest.
He made birds out of clay and set them free, and they flew away,
singing.

At last I made bold to ask him to tell us who he was.

“An angel,” he said, quite simply, and set another bird free and
clapped his hands and made it fly away.

A kind of awe fell upon us when we heard him say that, and we were
afraid again; but he said we need not be troubled, there was no
occasion for us to be afraid of an angel, and he liked us, anyway.
He went on chatting as simply and unaffectedly as ever; and while he
talked he made a crowd of little men and women the size of your finger,
and they went diligently to work and cleared and leveled off a space
a couple of yards square in the grass and began to build a cunning
little castle in it, the women mixing the mortar and carrying it up
the scaffoldings in pails on their heads, just as our work-women have
always done, and the men laying the courses of masonry--five hundred
of these toy people swarming briskly about and working diligently and
wiping the sweat off their faces as natural as life. In the absorbing
interest of watching those five hundred little people make the castle
grow step by step and course by course, and take shape and symmetry,
that feeling and awe soon passed away and we were quite comfortable and
at home again. We asked if we might make some people, and he said yes,
and told Seppi to make some cannon for the walls, and told Nikolaus to
make some halberdiers, with breastplates and greaves and helmets, and
I was to make some cavalry, with horses, and in allotting these tasks
he called us by our names, but did not say how he knew them. Then Seppi
asked him what his own name was, and he said, tranquilly, “Satan,” and
held out a chip and caught a little woman on it who was falling from
the scaffolding and put her back where she belonged, and said, “She is
an idiot to step backward like that and not notice what she is about.”

It caught us suddenly, that name did, and our work dropped out of our
hands and broke to pieces--a cannon, a halberdier, and a horse. Satan
laughed, and asked what was the matter. I said, “Nothing, only it
seemed a strange name for an angel.” He asked why.

“Because it’s--it’s--well, it’s his name, you know.”

“Yes--he is my uncle.”

He said it placidly, but it took our breath for a moment and made our
hearts beat. He did not seem to notice that, but mended our halberdiers
and things with a touch, handing them to us finished, and said, “Don’t
you remember?--he was an angel himself, once.”

“Yes--it’s true,” said Seppi; “I didn’t think of that.”

“Before the Fall he was blameless.”

“Yes,” said Nikolaus, “he was without sin.”

“It is a good family--ours,” said Satan; “there is not a better. He is
the only member of it that has ever sinned.”

I should not be able to make any one understand how exciting it all
was. You know that kind of quiver that trembles around through you when
you are seeing something so strange and enchanting and wonderful that
it is just a fearful joy to be alive and look at it; and you know how
you gaze, and your lips turn dry and your breath comes short, but you
wouldn’t be anywhere but there, not for the world. I was bursting to
ask one question--I had it on my tongue’s end and could hardly hold it
back--but I was ashamed to ask it; it might be a rudeness. Satan set an
ox down that he had been making, and smiled up at me and said:

“It wouldn’t be a rudeness, and I should forgive it if it was. Have I
seen him? Millions of times. From the time that I was a little child a
thousand years old I was his second favorite among the nursery angels
of our blood and lineage--to use a human phrase--yes, from that time
until the Fall, eight thousand years, measured as you count time.”

“Eight--thousand!”

“Yes.” He turned to Seppi, and went on as if answering something that
was in Seppi’s mind: “Why, naturally I look like a boy, for that
is what I am. With us what you call time is a spacious thing; it
takes a long stretch of it to grow an angel to full age.” There was
a question in my mind, and he turned to me and answered it, “I am
sixteen thousand years old--counting as you count.” Then he turned to
Nikolaus and said: “No, the Fall did not affect me nor the rest of the
relationship. It was only he that I was named for who ate of the fruit
of the tree and then beguiled the man and the woman with it. We others
are still ignorant of sin; we are not able to commit it; we are without
blemish, and shall abide in that estate always. We--” Two of the little
workmen were quarreling, and in buzzing little bumblebee voices they
were cursing and swearing at each other; now came blows and blood; then
they locked themselves together in a life-and-death struggle. Satan
reached out his hand and crushed the life out of them with his fingers,
threw them away, wiped the red from his fingers on his handkerchief,
and went on talking where he had left off: “We cannot do wrong; neither
have we any disposition to do it, for we do not know what it is.”

It seemed a strange speech, in the circumstances, but we barely
noticed that, we were so shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he
had committed--for murder it was, that was its true name, and it was
without palliation or excuse, for the men had not wronged him in any
way. It made us miserable, for we loved him, and had thought him so
noble and so beautiful and gracious, and had honestly believed he was
an angel; and to have him do this cruel thing--ah, it lowered him so,
and we had had such pride in him. He went right on talking, just as if
nothing had happened, telling about his travels, and the interesting
things he had seen in the big worlds of our solar system and of other
solar systems far away in the remotenesses of space, and about the
customs of the immortals that inhabit them, somehow fascinating us,
enchanting us, charming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now
under our eyes, for the wives of the little dead men had found the
crushed and shapeless bodies and were crying over them, and sobbing
and lamenting, and a priest was kneeling there with his hands crossed
upon his breast, praying; and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were
massed about them, reverently uncovered, with their bare heads bowed,
and many with the tears running down--a scene which Satan paid no
attention to until the small noise of the weeping and praying began to
annoy him, then he reached out and took the heavy board seat out of our
swing and brought it down and mashed all those people into the earth
just as if they had been flies, and went on talking just the same.

An angel, and kill a priest! An angel who did not know how to do wrong,
and yet destroys in cold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women
who had never done him any harm! It made us sick to see that awful
deed, and to think that none of those poor creatures was prepared
except the priest, for none of them had ever heard a mass or seen a
church. And we were witnesses; we had seen these murders done and it
was our duty to tell, and let the law take its course.

But he went on talking right along, and worked his enchantments upon us
again with that fatal music of his voice. He made us forget everything;
we could only listen to him, and love him, and be his slaves, to do
with us as he would. He made us drunk with the joy of being with him,
and of looking into the heaven of his eyes, and of feeling the ecstasy
that thrilled along our veins from the touch of his hand.




CHAPTER III


The Stranger had seen everything, he had been everywhere, he knew
everything, and he forgot nothing. What another must study, he learned
at a glance; there were no difficulties for him. And he made things
live before you when he told about them. He saw the world made; he saw
Adam created; he saw Samson surge against the pillars and bring the
temple down in ruins about him; he saw Cæsar’s death; he told of the
daily life in heaven; he had seen the damned writhing in the red waves
of hell; and he made us see all these things, and it was as if we were
on the spot and looking at them with our own eyes. And we felt them,
too, but there was no sign that they were anything to him beyond mere
entertainments. Those visions of hell, those poor babes and women and
girls and lads and men shrieking and supplicating in anguish--why, we
could hardly bear it, but he was as bland about it as if it had been so
many imitation rats in an artificial fire.

And always when he was talking about men and women here on the earth
and their doings--even their grandest and sublimest--we were secretly
ashamed, for his manner showed that to him they and their doings were
of paltry poor consequence; often you would think he was talking about
flies, if you didn’t know. Once he even said, in so many words, that
our people down here were quite interesting to him, notwithstanding
they were so dull and ignorant and trivial and conceited, and so
diseased and rickety, and such a shabby, poor, worthless lot all
around. He said it in a quite matter-of-course way and without
bitterness, just as a person might talk about bricks or manure or any
other thing that was of no consequence and hadn’t feelings. I could see
he meant no offense, but in my thoughts I set it down as not very good
manners.

“Manners!” he said. “Why, it is merely the truth, and truth is good
manners; manners are a fiction. The castle is done. Do you like it?”

  [Illustration: THE LIGHTNING BLAZED OUT FLASH UPON FLASH
                 AND SET THE CASTLE ON FIRE]

Any one would have been obliged to like it. It was lovely to look
at, it was so shapely and fine, and so cunningly perfect in all
its particulars, even to the little flags waving from the turrets.
Satan said we must put the artillery in place now, and station the
halberdiers and display the cavalry. Our men and horses were a
spectacle to see, they were so little like what they were intended
for; for, of course, we had no art in making such things. Satan said
they were the worst he had seen; and when he touched them and made
them alive, it was just ridiculous the way they acted, on account of
their legs not being of uniform lengths. They reeled and sprawled
around as if they were drunk, and endangered everybody’s lives around
them, and finally fell over and lay helpless and kicking. It made us
all laugh, though it was a shameful thing to see. The guns were charged
with dirt, to fire a salute, but they were so crooked and so badly
made that they all burst when they went off, and killed some of the
gunners and crippled the others. Satan said we would have a storm now,
and an earthquake, if we liked, but we must stand off a piece, out of
danger. We wanted to call the people away, too, but he said never mind
them; they were of no consequence, and we could make more, some time or
other, if we needed them.

A small storm-cloud began to settle down black over the castle, and
the miniature lightning and thunder began to play, and the ground to
quiver, and the wind to pipe and wheeze, and the rain to fall, and all
the people flocked into the castle for shelter. The cloud settled down
blacker and blacker, and one could see the castle only dimly through
it; the lightning blazed out flash upon flash and pierced the castle
and set it on fire, and the flames shone out red and fierce through the
cloud, and the people came flying out, shrieking, but Satan brushed
them back, paying no attention to our begging and crying and imploring;
and in the midst of the howling of the wind and volleying of the
thunder the magazine blew up, the earthquake rent the ground wide, and
the castle’s wreck and ruin tumbled into the chasm, which swallowed it
from sight and closed upon it, with all that innocent life, not one of
the five hundred poor creatures escaping. Our hearts were broken; we
could not keep from crying.

“Don’t cry,” Satan said; “they were of no value.”

“But they are gone to hell!”

“Oh, it is no matter; we can make plenty more.”

It was of no use to try to move him; evidently he was wholly without
feelings, and could not understand. He was full of bubbling spirits,
and as gay as if this were a wedding instead of a fiendish massacre.
And he was bent on making us feel as he did, and of course his magic
accomplished his desire. It was no trouble to him; he did whatever he
pleased with us. In a little while we were dancing on that grave, and
he was playing to us on a strange, sweet instrument which he took out
of his pocket; and the music--but there is no music like that, unless
perhaps in heaven, and that was where he brought it from, he said. It
made one mad, for pleasure; and we could not take our eyes from him,
and the looks that went out of our eyes came from our hearts, and their
dumb speech was worship. He brought the dance from heaven, too, and the
bliss of paradise was in it.

Presently he said he must go away on an errand. But we could not bear
the thought of it, and clung to him, and pleaded with him to stay;
and that pleased him, and he said so, and said he would not go yet,
but would wait a little while and we would sit down and talk a few
minutes longer; and he told us Satan was only his real name, and he
was to be known by it to us alone, but he had chosen another one to be
called by in the presence of others; just a common one, such as people
have--Philip Traum.

It sounded so odd and mean for such a being! But it was his decision,
and we said nothing; his decision was sufficient.

We had seen wonders this day; and my thoughts began to run on the
pleasure it would be to tell them when I got home, but he noticed those
thoughts, and said:

“No, all these matters are a secret among us four. I do not mind your
trying to tell them, if you like, but I will protect your tongues, and
nothing of the secret will escape from them.”

It was a disappointment, but it couldn’t be helped, and it cost us a
sigh or two. We talked pleasantly along, and he was always reading our
thoughts and responding to them, and it seemed to me that this was the
most wonderful of all the things he did, but he interrupted my musings
and said:

“No, it would be wonderful for you, but it is not wonderful for me. I
am not limited like you. I am not subject to human conditions. I can
measure and understand your human weaknesses, for I have studied them;
but I have none of them. My flesh is not real, although it would seem
firm to your touch; my clothes are not real; I am a spirit. Father
Peter is coming.” We looked around, but did not see any one. “He is not
in sight yet, but you will see him presently.”

“Do you know him, Satan?”

“No.”

“Won’t you talk with him when he comes? He is not ignorant and dull,
like us, and he would so like to talk with you. Will you?”

“Another time, yes, but not now. I must go on my errand after a little.
There he is now; you can see him. Sit still, and don’t say anything.”

We looked up and saw Father Peter approaching through the chestnuts.
We three were sitting together in the grass, and Satan sat in front
of us in the path. Father Peter came slowly along with his head down,
thinking, and stopped within a couple of yards of us and took off his
hat and got out his silk handkerchief, and stood there mopping his
face and looking as if he were going to speak to us, but he didn’t.
Presently he muttered, “I can’t think what brought me here; it seems as
if I were in my study a minute ago--but I suppose I have been dreaming
along for an hour and have come all this stretch without noticing; for
I am not myself in these troubled days.” Then he went mumbling along
to himself and walked straight through Satan, just as if nothing were
there. It made us catch our breath to see it. We had the impulse to
cry out, the way you nearly always do when a startling thing happens,
but something mysteriously restrained us and we remained quiet, only
breathing fast. Then the trees hid Father Peter after a little, and
Satan said:

“It is as I told you--I am only a spirit.”

“Yes, one perceives it now,” said Nikolaus, “but we are not spirits. It
is plain he did not see you, but were we invisible, too? He looked at
us, but he didn’t seem to see us.”

“No, none of us was visible to him, for I wished it so.”

It seemed almost too good to be true, that we were actually seeing
these romantic and wonderful things, and that it was not a dream. And
there he sat, looking just like anybody--so natural and simple and
charming, and chatting along again the same as ever, and--well, words
cannot make you understand what we felt. It was an ecstasy; and an
ecstasy is a thing that will not go into words; it feels like music,
and one cannot tell about music so that another person can get the
feeling of it. He was back in the old ages once more now, and making
them live before us. He had seen so much, so much! It was just a
wonder to look at him and try to think how it must seem to have such
experience behind one.

But it made you seem sorrowfully trivial, and the creature of a day,
and such a short and paltry day, too. And he didn’t say anything to
raise up your drooping pride--no, not a word. He always spoke of men
in the same old indifferent way--just as one speaks of bricks and
manure-piles and such things; you could see that they were of no
consequence to him, one way or the other. He didn’t mean to hurt us,
you could see that; just as we don’t mean to insult a brick when we
disparage it; a brick’s emotions are nothing to us; it never occurs to
us to think whether it has any or not.

Once when he was bunching the most illustrious kings and conquerors
and poets and prophets and pirates and beggars together--just a
brick-pile--I was shamed into putting in a word for man, and asked
him why he made so much difference between men and himself. He had to
struggle with that a moment; he didn’t seem to understand how I could
ask such a strange question. Then he said:

“The difference between man and me? The difference between a mortal and
an immortal? between a cloud and a spirit?” He picked up a wood-louse
that was creeping along a piece of bark: “What is the difference
between Cæsar and this?”

I said, “One cannot compare things which by their nature and by the
interval between them are not comparable.”

“You have answered your own question,” he said. “I will expand it.
Man is made of dirt--I saw him made. I am not made of dirt. Man is
a museum of diseases, a home of impurities; he comes to-day and is
gone to-morrow; he begins as dirt and departs as stench; I am of the
aristocracy of the Imperishables. And man has the  Moral Sense . You
understand? He has the  Moral Sense . That would seem to be difference
enough between us, all by itself.”

He stopped there, as if that settled the matter. I was sorry, for at
that time I had but a dim idea of what the Moral Sense was. I merely
knew that we were proud of having it, and when he talked like that
about it, it wounded me, and I felt as a girl feels who thinks her
dearest finery is being admired and then overhears strangers making fun
of it. For a while we were all silent, and I, for one, was depressed.
Then Satan began to chat again, and soon he was sparkling along in such
a cheerful and vivacious vein that my spirits rose once more. He told
some very cunning things that put us in a gale of laughter; and when he
was telling about the time that Samson tied the torches to the foxes’
tails and set them loose in the Philistines’ corn, and Samson sitting
on the fence slapping his thighs and laughing, with the tears running
down his cheeks, and lost his balance and fell off the fence, the
memory of that picture got him to laughing, too, and we did have a most
lovely and jolly time. By and by he said:

“I am going on my errand now.”

“Don’t!” we all said. “Don’t go; stay with us. You won’t come back.”

“Yes, I will; I give you my word.”

“When? To-night? Say when.”

“It won’t be long. You will see.”

“We like you.”

“And I you. And as a proof of it I will show you something fine to see.
Usually when I go I merely vanish; but now I will dissolve myself and
let you see me do it.”

He stood up, and it was quickly finished. He thinned away and thinned
away until he was a soap-bubble, except that he kept his shape. You
could see the bushes through him as clearly as you see things through
a soap-bubble, and all over him played and flashed the delicate
iridescent colors of the bubble, and along with them was that thing
shaped like a window-sash which you always see on the globe of
the bubble. You have seen a bubble strike the carpet and lightly
bound along two or three times before it bursts. He did that. He
sprang--touched the grass--bounded--floated along--touched again--and
so on, and presently exploded--puff! and in his place was vacancy.

It was a strange and beautiful thing to see. We did not say anything,
but sat wondering and dreaming and blinking; and finally Seppi roused
up and said, mournfully sighing:

“I suppose none of it has happened.”

Nikolaus sighed and said about the same.

I was miserable to hear them say it, for it was the same cold fear that
was in my own mind. Then we saw poor old Father Peter wandering along
back, with his head bent down, searching the ground. When he was pretty
close to us he looked up and saw us, and said, “How long have you been
here, boys?”

“A little while, Father.”

“Then it is since I came by, and maybe you can help me. Did you come up
by the path?”

“Yes, Father.”

“That is good. I came the same way. I have lost my wallet. There wasn’t
much in it, but a very little is much to me, for it was all I had. I
suppose you haven’t seen anything of it?”

“No, Father, but we will help you hunt.”

“It is what I was going to ask you. Why, here it is!”

We hadn’t noticed it; yet there it lay, right where Satan stood when he
began to melt--if he did melt and it wasn’t a delusion. Father Peter
picked it up and looked very much surprised.

“It is mine,” he said, “but not the contents. This is fat; mine was
flat; mine was light; this is heavy.” He opened it; it was stuffed as
full as it could hold with gold coins. He let us gaze our fill; and of
course we did gaze, for we had never seen so much money at one time
before. All our mouths came open to say “Satan did it!” but nothing
came out. There it was, you see--we couldn’t tell what Satan didn’t
want told; he had said so himself.

“Boys, did you do this?”

It made us laugh. And it made him laugh, too, as soon as he thought
what a foolish question it was.

“Who has been here?”

Our mouths came open to answer, but stood so for a moment, because we
couldn’t say “Nobody,” for it wouldn’t be true, and the right word
didn’t seem to come; then I thought of the right one, and said it:

“Not a human being.”

“That is so,” said the others, and let their mouths go shut.

“It is not so,” said Father Peter, and looked at us very severely.
“I came by here a while ago, and there was no one here, but that is
nothing; some one has been here since. I don’t mean to say that the
person didn’t pass here before you came, and I don’t mean to say you
saw him, but some one did pass, that I know. On your honor--you saw no
one?”

“Not a human being.”

“That is sufficient; I know you are telling me the truth.”

He began to count the money on the path, we on our knees eagerly
helping to stack it in little piles.

“It’s eleven hundred ducats odd!” he said. “Oh dear! if it were only
mine--and I need it so!” and his voice broke and his lips quivered.

“It is yours, sir!” we all cried out at once, “every heller!”

“No--it isn’t mine. Only four ducats are mine; the rest...!” He fell to
dreaming, poor old soul, and caressing some of the coins in his hands,
and forgot where he was, sitting there on his heels with his old gray
head bare; it was pitiful to see. “No,” he said, waking up, “it isn’t
mine. I can’t account for it. I think some enemy ... it must be a trap.”

Nikolaus said: “Father Peter, with the exception of the astrologer you
haven’t a real enemy in the village--nor Marget, either. And not even a
half-enemy that’s rich enough to chance eleven hundred ducats to do you
a mean turn. I’ll ask you if that’s so or not?”

He couldn’t get around that argument, and it cheered him up. “But it
isn’t mine, you see--it isn’t mine, in any case.”

He said it in a wistful way, like a person that wouldn’t be sorry, but
glad, if anybody would contradict him.

“It is yours, Father Peter, and we are witness to it. Aren’t we, boys?”

“Yes, we are--and we’ll stand by it, too.”

“Bless your hearts, you do almost persuade me; you do, indeed. If I
had only a hundred-odd ducats of it! The house is mortgaged for it, and
we’ve no home for our heads if we don’t pay to-morrow. And that four
ducats is all we’ve got in the--”

“It’s yours, every bit of it, and you’ve got to take it--we are bail
that it’s all right. Aren’t we, Theodor? Aren’t we, Seppi?”

We two said yes, and Nikolaus stuffed the money back into the shabby
old wallet and made the owner take it. So he said he would use two
hundred of it, for his house was good enough security for that, and
would put the rest at interest till the rightful owner came for it;
and on our side we must sign a paper showing how he got the money--a
paper to show to the villagers as proof that he had not got out of his
troubles dishonestly.




CHAPTER IV


It made immense talk next day, when Father Peter paid Solomon Isaacs in
gold and left the rest of the money with him at interest. Also, there
was a pleasant change; many people called at the house to congratulate
him, and a number of cool old friends became kind and friendly again;
and, to top all, Marget was invited to a party.

And there was no mystery; Father Peter told the whole circumstance just
as it happened, and said he could not account for it, only it was the
plain hand of Providence, so far as he could see.

One or two shook their heads and said privately it looked more like the
hand of Satan; and really that seemed a surprisingly good guess for
ignorant people like that. Some came slyly buzzing around and tried
to coax us boys to come out and “tell the truth”; and promised they
wouldn’t ever tell, but only wanted to know for their own satisfaction,
because the whole thing was so curious. They even wanted to buy the
secret, and pay money for it; and if we could have invented something
that would answer--but we couldn’t; we hadn’t the ingenuity, so we had
to let the chance go by, and it was a pity.

We carried that secret around without any trouble, but the other one,
the big one, the splendid one, burned the very vitals of us, it was
so hot to get out and we so hot to let it out and astonish people
with it. But we had to keep it in; in fact, it kept itself in. Satan
said it would, and it did. We went off every day and got to ourselves
in the woods so that we could talk about Satan, and really that was
the only subject we thought of or cared anything about; and day and
night we watched for him and hoped he would come, and we got more
and more impatient all the time. We hadn’t any interest in the other
boys any more, and wouldn’t take part in their games and enterprises.
They seemed so tame, after Satan; and their doings so trifling and
commonplace after his adventures in antiquity and the constellations,
and his miracles and meltings and explosions, and all that.

During the first day we were in a state of anxiety on account of one
thing, and we kept going to Father Peter’s house on one pretext or
another to keep track of it. That was the gold coin; we were afraid it
would crumble and turn to dust, like fairy money. If it did--But it
didn’t. At the end of the day no complaint had been made about it, so
after that we were satisfied that it was real gold, and dropped the
anxiety out of our minds.

There was a question which we wanted to ask Father Peter, and finally
we went there the second evening, a little diffidently, after drawing
straws, and I asked it as casually as I could, though it did not sound
as casual as I wanted, because I didn’t know how:

“What is the Moral Sense, sir?”

He looked down, surprised, over his great spectacles, and said, “Why,
it is the faculty which enables us to distinguish good from evil.”

It threw some light, but not a glare, and I was a little disappointed,
also to some degree embarrassed. He was waiting for me to go on, so, in
default of anything else to say, I asked, “Is it valuable?”

“Valuable? Heavens! lad, it is the one thing that lifts man above the
beasts that perish and makes him heir to immortality!”

This did not remind me of anything further to say, so I got out, with
the other boys, and we went away with that indefinite sense you have
often had of being filled but not fatted. They wanted me to explain,
but I was tired.

We passed out through the parlor, and there was Marget at the spinnet
teaching Marie Lueger. So one of the deserting pupils was back; and an
influential one, too; the others would follow. Marget jumped up and
ran and thanked us again, with tears in her eyes--this was the third
time--for saving her and her uncle from being turned into the street,
and we told her again we hadn’t done it; but that was her way, she
never could be grateful enough for anything a person did for her; so
we let her have her say. And as we passed through the garden, there was
Wilhelm Meidling sitting there waiting, for it was getting toward the
edge of the evening, and he would be asking Marget to take a walk along
the river with him when she was done with the lesson. He was a young
lawyer, and succeeding fairly well and working his way along, little
by little. He was very fond of Marget, and she of him. He had not
deserted along with the others, but had stood his ground all through.
His faithfulness was not lost on Marget and her uncle. He hadn’t so
very much talent, but he was handsome and good, and these are a kind
of talents themselves and help along. He asked us how the lesson was
getting along, and we told him it was about done. And maybe it was so;
we didn’t know anything about it, but we judged it would please him,
and it did, and didn’t cost us anything.




CHAPTER V


On the fourth day comes the astrologer from his crumbling old tower up
the valley, where he had heard the news, I reckon. He had a private
talk with us, and we told him what we could, for we were mightily in
dread of him. He sat there studying and studying awhile to himself;
then he asked:

“How many ducats did you say?”

“Eleven hundred and seven, sir.”

Then he said, as if he were talking to himself: “It is ver-y singular.
Yes ... very strange. A curious coincidence.” Then he began to ask
questions, and went over the whole ground from the beginning, we
answering. By and by he said: “Eleven hundred and six ducats. It is a
large sum.”

“Seven,” said Seppi, correcting him.

“Oh, seven, was it? Of course a ducat more or less isn’t of
consequence, but you said eleven hundred and six before.”

It would not have been safe for us to say he was mistaken, but we knew
he was. Nikolaus said, “We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to
say seven.”

“Oh, it is no matter, lad; it was merely that I noticed the
discrepancy. It is several days, and you cannot be expected to remember
precisely. One is apt to be inexact when there is no particular
circumstance to impress the count upon the memory.”

“But there was one, sir,” said Seppi, eagerly.

“What was it, my son?” asked the astrologer, indifferently.

“First, we all counted the piles of coin, each in turn, and all made
it the same--eleven hundred and six. But I had slipped one out, for
fun, when the count began, and now I slipped it back and said, ‘I think
there is a mistake--there are eleven hundred and seven; let us count
again.’ We did, and of course I was right. They were astonished; then I
told how it came about.”

The astrologer asked us if this was so, and we said it was.

“That settles it,” he said. “I know the thief now. Lads, the money was
stolen.”

  [Illustration: ON THE FOURTH DAY COMES THE ASTROLOGER FROM HIS
                 CRUMBLING OLD TOWER]

Then he went away, leaving us very much troubled, and wondering what
he could mean. In about an hour we found out; for by that time it was
all over the village that Father Peter had been arrested for stealing
a great sum of money from the astrologer. Everybody’s tongue was loose
and going. Many said it was not in Father Peter’s character and must be
a mistake; but the others shook their heads and said misery and want
could drive a suffering man to almost anything. About one detail
there were no differences; all agreed that Father Peter’s account of
how the money came into his hands was just about unbelievable--it
had such an impossible look. They said it might have come into the
astrologer’s hands in some such way, but into Father Peter’s, never!
Our characters began to suffer now. We were Father Peter’s only
witnesses; how much did he probably pay us to back up his fantastic
tale? People talked that kind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly,
and were full of scoffings when we begged them to believe really we had
told only the truth. Our parents were harder on us than any one else.
Our fathers said we were disgracing our families, and they commanded us
to purge ourselves of our lie, and there was no limit to their anger
when we continued to say we had spoken true. Our mothers cried over us
and begged us to give back our bribe and get back our honest names and
save our families from shame, and come out and honorably confess. And
at last we were so worried and harassed that we tried to tell the whole
thing, Satan and all--but no, it wouldn’t come out. We were hoping
and longing all the time that Satan would come and help us out of our
trouble, but there was no sign of him.

Within an hour after the astrologer’s talk with us, Father Peter was
in prison and the money sealed up and in the hands of the officers of
the law. The money was in a bag, and Solomon Isaacs said he had not
touched it since he had counted it; his oath was taken that it was the
same money, and that the amount was eleven hundred and seven ducats.
Father Peter claimed trial by the ecclesiastical court, but our other
priest, Father Adolf, said an ecclesiastical court hadn’t jurisdiction
over a suspended priest. The bishop upheld him. That settled it; the
case would go to trial in the civil court. The court would not sit for
some time to come. Wilhelm Meidling would be Father Peter’s lawyer and
do the best he could, of course, but he told us privately that a weak
case on his side and all the power and prejudice on the other made the
outlook bad.

So Marget’s new happiness died a quick death. No friends came to
condole with her, and none were expected; an unsigned note withdrew her
invitation to the party. There would be no scholars to take lessons.
How could she support herself? She could remain in the house, for the
mortgage was paid off, though the government and not poor Solomon
Isaacs had the mortgage-money in its grip for the present. Old Ursula,
who was cook, chambermaid, housekeeper, laundress, and everything else
for Father Peter, and had been Marget’s nurse in earlier years, said
God would provide. But she said that from habit, for she was a good
Christian. She meant to help in the providing, to make sure, if she
could find a way.

We boys wanted to go and see Marget and show friendliness for her, but
our parents were afraid of offending the community and wouldn’t let
us. The astrologer was going around inflaming everybody against Father
Peter, and saying he was an abandoned thief and had stolen eleven
hundred and seven gold ducats from him. He said he knew he was a thief
from that fact, for it was exactly the sum he had lost and which Father
Peter pretended he had “found.”

In the afternoon of the fourth day after the catastrophe old Ursula
appeared at our house and asked for some washing to do, and begged my
mother to keep this secret, to save Marget’s pride, who would stop this
project if she found it out, yet Marget had not enough to eat and was
growing weak. Ursula was growing weak herself, and showed it; and she
ate of the food that was offered her like a starving person, but could
not be persuaded to carry any home, for Marget would not eat charity
food. She took some clothes down to the stream to wash them, but we saw
from the window that handling the bat was too much for her strength; so
she was called back and a trifle of money offered her, which she was
afraid to take lest Marget should suspect; then she took it, saying she
would explain that she found it in the road. To keep it from being a
lie and damning her soul, she got me to drop it while she watched; then
she went along by there and found it, and exclaimed with surprise and
joy, and picked it up and went her way. Like the rest of the village,
she could tell every-day lies fast enough and without taking any
precautions against fire and brimstone on their account; but this was a
new kind of lie, and it had a dangerous look because she hadn’t had any
practice in it. After a week’s practice it wouldn’t have given her any
trouble. It is the way we are made.

I was in trouble, for how would Marget live? Ursula could not find a
coin in the road every day--perhaps not even a second one. And I was
ashamed, too, for not having been near Marget, and she so in need of
friends; but that was my parents’ fault, not mine, and I couldn’t help
it.

I was walking along the path, feeling very downhearted, when a most
cheery and tingling freshening-up sensation went rippling through me,
and I was too glad for any words, for I knew by that sign that Satan
was by. I had noticed it before. Next moment he was alongside of me
and I was telling him all my trouble and what had been happening to
Marget and her uncle. While we were talking we turned a curve and saw
old Ursula resting in the shade of a tree, and she had a lean stray
kitten in her lap and was petting it. I asked her where she got it, and
she said it came out of the woods and followed her; and she said it
probably hadn’t any mother or any friends and she was going to take it
home and take care of it. Satan said:

“I understand you are very poor. Why do you want to add another mouth
to feed? Why don’t you give it to some rich person?”

Ursula bridled at this and said: “Perhaps you would like to have it.
You must be rich, with your fine clothes and quality airs.” Then she
sniffed and said: “Give it to the rich--the idea! The rich don’t care
for anybody but themselves; it’s only the poor that have feeling for
the poor, and help them. The poor and God. God will provide for this
kitten.”

“What makes you think so?”

Ursula’s eyes snapped with anger. “Because I know it!” she said. “Not a
sparrow falls to the ground without His seeing it.”

“But it falls, just the same. What good is seeing it fall?”
