take. And it does seem sometimes as if I should have set 
my small self aside, and rested in his love, grown larger 
and more tranquil of soul. It is not even as if I had loved 
some one else. That might have been an excuse." 

'"I am very glad you did not," was the grave reply. 
" Such mistakes have been, as well, but I would rather 
have this clear seeing for you than any pure want for self. 
I think Charlie came to understand the larger satisfying 
and peace. And now, Kathie, you must be patient and 
tender with mamma. Remember you have been carrying 
the burden quite a long while, but it has newly come upon 
her, and mothers cherish so many pretty hopes of their 
daughters' marriages. It is like living over their own girl 
life." 

"And Rob, too," cried Kathie remorsefully, quite dis- 





regarding her sentence. ' ' Poor mamma ; we ought to be 
very devoted to make up all this." 

' ' It will be made up presently with tender, earnest 
affection," he said hopefully. " Robert goes on so well 
that I sometimes think living out of such a trouble is 
the best discipline he could have had. He has grown 
more careful of consequences to others, and he has 
evinced great steadiness of purpose. I do believe his 
nursing and caring for Bruce brought out the tender side 
of his nature, the side most boys are ashamed to show, 
and not infrequently assume a sort of roughness to hide it, 
quite forgetting what the term u gentleman " includes. I 
hope we shall have many happy years together." 

"You arc so good. Oh, what should I do without 
you ? " cried Kathie impulsively. 

Uncle Robert smiled. 

It was not an easy task, Kathie found, living out of 
such a mistake. A less noble lover might have made it 
harder, but Charlie generously took upon himself much of 
the burden. She might easily have been over-influenced by 
circumstances. He remembered on the night he had first 
spoken there had been simply girlish awe and wonder, no 
great throb of joy, no exceeding gladness any of the time. 
He had failed to touch the depth of her nature, to awaken 
the keenest bliss. For himself, he might be satisfied to 
do and to give, but her life ought to be wider and more 
outflowing than in mere passive recipience. 

He explained the matter first to Jessie, who was really 
hurt and angry. It seemed a slight put upon Charlie. 

"No, Jessie," he said; "it would have been a worse 
thing for her to have married me and never know of her 
own sure experience the highest joy of life She would 
have made herself content, but it would not have been a 
wholesome, happy life." 

"Are you quite sure she is not in love with Bruce 
Mackenzie ? " 





" She could not love a finer man." 

" You are as good and noble, and more self-sacrificing," 
cried Jessie vehemently. u Charlie, why should you 
stand aside for any other ? " 

''If Kathie loves Bruce it is all unknown to herself, and 
then it would be God's sure seal that her love was not for 
me. And if he loved her " 

" Let them find it out then," said Jessie resentfully. 

Mother Darrell was the greatest comforter to Kathie. 

" My dear," she said, ' ' we all regret it so deeply. I am 
not sure but we have coveted you. And yet it has seemed 
to me that you were always too near to be the nearest, for 
friends do not always make lovers. I want you to come 
just the same, to be to us what you were before. We old 
people can't aford to let a pleasure slip out of our lives 
because it may take a different turn from what we hoped. 
God knows best." 

They had all been so engrossed through this time with 
Kathie that Rob had gone his way, straying in pleasant 
fields unnoticed. He and Miss Collamore had settled into 
a steady kind of friendship. Uncle Robert remarked with 
pleasure the touches of reticence in certain directions, the 
little fence of propriety she placed about herself and 
never overstepped, as if she understood what might have 
been but was not to be. Fred's intimacy with Eugene 
brought them all nearer together in many ways. 

During her visit in New York Robert had made himself 
chief cavalier to her and Kathie. Mr. Gartney, who had 
stood with her at her cousin's marriage, had not proved 
insensible to her charms, and made delicate advances 
toward a closer acquaintance. His business standing and 
character were excellent, and he was received by the Col- 
lamores with the refined cordiality that told him under any 
circumstances he was a welcome guest. 

His visits startled Miss Collamore out of her wonted 
tranquillity. The young men of Brookside had at times 





shown preferences, but these were easily turned aside. 
This man had a definite purpose ; he showed it in his bear- 
ing, in the peculiar grace of his attention. He was refined, 
chivalrous, well informed, quite fit to be set beside Mr. 
Hunsdon. There was no reason why a girl should not like 
him, or let herself drift into the swift, pleasant stream of 
interest and caring until it came to more, and the mean- 
ing proved itself to both. 

There was another side. Fay Collamore could not, 
would not look at this when she could help. Sometimes 
it seemed to get sharply thrust under her notice ; there was 
a pang and a long, quivering breath, but it was soon over. 

Only of late there had come a troublesome shadow, a 
secret knowledge that however successful she might be in 
putting away any thought or temptation for herself, she 
could not so put it away for another. Now and then there 
came a flash of a " might have been" in Robert Alston's 
eyes, a touch of something in his voice that startled no one 
else, but struck a vague terror to her soul. It would be 
a sin to let it settle into any unhallowed longing. In her 
eyes he had been so brave, had borne his sad trial with 
a fortitude hardly belonging to youth, had made it no 
excuse for throwing away his bright young life. Even now 
he was studying between whiles with the boys, in case the 
step higher should come to him in the future. Could she 
let him mar his life a second time with any fondness for her? 

They were not the people who could keep to the level of 
a friendship ; she would not blind herself by any specious 
half-promises. He was ardent, impetuous, strong, and 
passion might carry him like a whirlwind for a brief space, 
but if even a word took him over the boundary, it could 
never be brought back with any repentance. 

And the woman who held his freedom might live years. 
Every one said so. To wish it otherwise were a crime. 

What if she placed an effectual barrier between. Could 
she not make herself happy in another life if she knew she 
had put temptation Quite out of his way? 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

IT was the soft lapsing of the spring day into evening 
The windows were open, and the fragrance of the ever- 
greens, the delicate moisture of the young grass that had 
drank in the sunshine all day and was now giving it out to 
the dew, made the air sweet with promise. Robert Alston 
had taken a holiday, partly to attend to a little business 
for Mr. Meredith, which would have made him too late 
for a day in the city. He had been out rambling, and 
returned with a great bunch of wild flowers, Kathie and 
his mother were so fond of them. Kathie was not in, and 
Mrs. Collamore sat with his mother in the parlor, so he 
stepped into the library and threw himself in an easy-chair 
by the window. 

Uncle Robert came up the path, pausing to look at the 
hyacinth bed. In his hand he held two or three letters, 
and, catching a glimpse of his nephew, came across the 
piazza to the window and stepped in. Mrs. Collamore 
was taking her leave now. She seemed to pause in the hall 
and said quite distinctly, though in her low, even tone, 

" We all like him very much, and think it will be a good 
match for Fay. I shall have only my son left. I think I 
should rather keep her nearer, but I must comfort myself 
with Louise and her baby." 

Rob sprang up with a sudden, decisive impulse, and his 
face was like marble. " It is Mr. Gartney," he said in a 
hoarse, strained whisper. 

" Yes, Robert." The voice was sharp, decisive. 

The young man dropped back in his chair. In his 





momentary madness he hardly cared how much he had 
betrayed. 

" Robert, you would have no right in smy event ; rouse 
yourself and think a moment." 

"Of what shall I think?" in a passionate, despairing 
tone. " That I have lost my chance with the only woman 
who could have helped me to live a perfect life ? That all 
the years to come " 

Mr. Conover closed the library door, and, returning, 
stood in front of the young man. 

" Robert," he said sternly, " has it come to this ? Have 
you allowed yourself to dream over this young girl until it 
has led to the verge of sin ? Better a hundred times that 
she should be removed from your reach." 

" You think so ! " in a bitter, hollow tone. "As if I 
could not dream over her and covet her anywhere ! And 
if she stayed, if she waited " 

"Rob, my boy," and the voice was infinitely tender, 
the touch on his arm strong, yet gentle, " you have for- 
gotten yourself and your duty. No madness can quite 
convince you that you have a right, that you are free " 

Robert Alston sprang up and stood straight, strong, 
and daring. Every pulse within his body had mutinied. 
There was a blaze of defiance in his eyes and a white 
line about the lips. 

' ' I should have been free ! I can be free ! " he declared 
in his madness. 

They glanced at each other steadily, and neither seemed 
to breathe. 

"If you were free," the elder said, "what would it 
avail, since she will belong to another? " 

" She would not. Uncle Robert, have a little pity on 
me. I can't tell you how I know it, but I do believe as 
firmly as I can believe anything, that if I went to Fay 
Collamore and told her of my love she would wait years. 
She would not marry. Why should T give up my chance ? " 





" Because it would be a sin and dishonor. It would 
stain your soul and sully the pure whiteness of hers. No ; 
you could not win Fay Collamore that way, and I thank 
God that it is so. Rob, when you have made such a brave 
fight, when you have won back respect, honor, will you 
throw them away in this mad endeavor ? I thought you 
were to be trusted to the uttermost. And I have news 
for you. See here ! " 

He lighted the lamp on the table and took the letter 
from its envelope, handing it to his nephew. A scornful 
smile crossed the scarlet lip, as if the first impulse were 
to fling it away. 

" Read it. It is your business." 

It was from the asylum physician, concise j r et compre- 
hensive. " They had remarked a great improvement in 
the patient for the last month. Some faint remembrance 
had returned. She had asked for her child, and seemed 
gratified when a babe had been brought her. Her youth 
and her good physical health gave them a slender hope 
that there might be some restoration in time." 

Robert Alston went over and over the letter, though he 
was not thinking at all. A horror seemed to have posses- 
sion of him. Moments passed before he spoke, then he 
said, almost savagely : 

"You believe I ought to have forgiven her? Well, I 
never, never shall. I might if she were dead." 

"O Robert!" 

He strode up and down the room in a tempest of passion. 
Then, as if suddenly bethinking himself, he said : 

"It is nearing train time. I must go to-night." 

" Let me drive you down." 

" No, I will walk ; I want to go alone. Say good by to 
my mother. There is your letter ! " And he threw it con- 
temptuously on the floor. 

' ' Robert, we cannot part this way. Stay '' 

But he flung off his uncle's arm and made a snatch at 


his hat from the rack in the hall. His steps echoed on the 
gravel walk an instant, then all was spring-time silence 
and softness again. 

Should he follow him ? What would he do in this des- 
perate mood ? There would be the long ride to the city, 
but the reaching there almost at midnight, the fierce strug- 
gle within himself. Ah, how would it end ? 

"God help him," he cried. " Save him from him- 
self." 

It had all been so sudden that now Robert Conover 
wondered if he had done his best, had acted with wisdom 
and prudence. Surely the mad boy would not dare to go 
to Fay. 

When he could reason himself to a state of calmness he 
went up-stairs. Kathie had just come in. He took with 
him Rob's flowers and a tenderer farewell than he had 
left. 

" Oh, how lovely ! " cried Kathie. " Dear Rob ! I did 
try to get back in time, but old Mrs. Boden had so many 
last messages." 

''And I have some news for you, Kathie," said Mrs. 
Alston. " Mrs. Collamore was here. She thinks Fay is 
very likely to marry Mr. Gartney ; but of course she will 
have to go to New York to live. You will be left quite 
alone presently." 

Kathie colored softly ; she never answered when her 
mother made comments like this. They were gradually 
coming back to their old love and confidence, and if she 
could have the tender patience to win all. 

Robert Alston went his way in a mad, blind fury. It 
came to him with the unreason of youth, what if he threw 
himself here under the car wheels ! Of what avail was life, 
and strength, and manhood, only to make the loss tenfold 
more bitter? She would go away out of his life, and what 
would be left? Only the hateful reminder of that boyish 
idiocy ? But no repentance could atone for the wrong she 





had done. No ; if she came and pleaded on her bended 
knees, he would never forgive her. She had blighted the 
man's promising career, she had kept him from the man's 
dear and tender love ! 

lie turned to the image of Fay Collamore and revelled 
in the vision of what might have been. Not a sweet would 
he miss, even if it turned to tenfold ashes and bitterness 
afterward. He let fancy have full play. Up to this 
time she had been sacred to him ; he had not even dared to 
dream of her. In this reckless mood he would stop for 
nothing. And all the years to come he must miss this 
glowing, enchanting happiness. 

He bowed his head and groaned in his misery. He had 
the seat to himself, and could indulge in a little weakness 
without prying eyes. From this mood he went to sullen 
despair. The night dropped down, and still he peered out 
in the darkness with hot eyes and throbbing brow. Of 
what avail had been all the struggle, all the resolving? He 
might as well have stayed in Chicago. There he would not 
have seen Fay. She would be at Brookside, in the city. 
She knew all the friends in the little circle and would meet 
them. He should see her another's man's wife. That 
woke all the passion of jealousy within him. 

The tumult went on, fierce, eager, sullen, and despairing 
by turns. They ran into the station. How strange it 
looked in the yellow-red glare, and the voices seemed like 
something heard in another world ! Yonder was a train 
steaming up. If he were to take it, to-morrow morning he 
would be far away. Would it not be better ? Away from 
temptation ! He laughed bitterly. 

Should he go home to the Merediths' ? They would be 
sitting up for him, Fred and Mr. Meredith. To go in 
there, serene and pleasant, and answer questions, ah, it 
would madden him ! Better roam the streets all night. 

Something came to him suddenly, and he stood quite 
still, as if stopped in the way. 





"When you come to love a woman placed out of your 
reach you will go to God, for nothing else will be strong 
enough to save you ! " 

Bruce had said that to him. He, too, had seen a love 
placed out of his way. 

At first Robert Alston had a dim, awful impression that 
he did not want to be saved, that he was in some uncom- 
prehended way quite strong enough for himself, or that no 
salvation could comfort him for the tremendous sacrifice 
wrenched up out of his life. Not made freely, not given. 

Where should he go ? The night was growing chilly and 
the streets beginning to look deserted. 

He had tramped around unthinkingly until he found him- 
self in Charlie DarrelFs vicinity. Another who had sacri- 
ficed all. What a mocking, illusive thing love was, a 
sweet madness ! 

He glanced up. There was a light in the window. 
Was this hero calm and tranquil after his fight? Ah, he 
fancied lie had fought it all out, but he did not think then 
this might come. Had not some one said in a sermon 
that it was a life warfare ? Was Charlie Darrell fighting 
always? What if lie knew Kathie was about to marry 
another, could he still wear his high, heavenly smile ? Or 
was there a strength he, Rob, knew nothing about? Life 
had been so pleasant since that terrible time, and he had 
gone bravely onward, believing the great storms over-past. 
Why should this have come? 

He paced up and down the street. Curious bits floated 
through his mind in a sharp, electric fashion ; texts heard 
long ago, it seemed, almost in another life : " God is faith- 
ful, who will with the temptation also make a way to 
escape, that ye may be able to bear it." How many had 
escaped ? how many wanted to escape ? 

The window above him was raised and a figure leaned 
out a little. Rob dropped his head and drew up his 
shoulders. He could not make up his mind whether he 





desired to see Charlie or not, but the light from the oppo- 
site lamp betrayed him. 

" Rob, wait until I come down," said an entreating 
voice. 

The young man strode fiercely away, then paused. The 
door opened and a light step came flying after him. 

" Rob, are they all well at home ? What has happened ? " 

" Nothing," pulling half away . 

"Come back with me; I am all alone. Let us talk it 
over, for something has happened to you ? " 

" You cannot help me." 

Charlie was leading him back. The hall lamp was out, 
but they groped up-stairs, guided by the long ray of light 
from the open door. Entering, Charlie pushed a chair 
forward with a cordial invitation, but Rob stood stupidly. 
His hair was blown about, his face set and pale, and his 
eyes were aglow with the wild light of passion. Had he 
been drinking? 

" Sit down and tell me," gently. "Perhaps it will not 
be as hard as you think." 

"I don't know," Robert Alston said unsteadily, drawing 
a long, quivering breath. "I suppose," laughing mirth- 
lessly, "I've been tempted of the devil ; murder, and all 
the long list of crimes mentioned somewhere. You all 
supposed I was going on so well." 

" So you were." Charlie sprang up beside him. Some- 
thing in the pure, high face seemed to touch Rob dimly. 
'' But a soldier may be surprised at his outpost, and it is 
his duty to be ready. The surprise is not a sin, but cow- 
ardice or negligence would be. Even there ' Thy hand 
shall hold me.' " 

" Why doesn't it, then? Oh, why should we live at all, 
Charlie? It seems such a useless, unmeaning, blurred, and 
wretched thing ! Nothing comes out of it all that you 
really want." 

He had wanted some denied gift, then. Charlie's intuitions
were rapid and sympathetic. A few days ago Rob 
was gay and glad ; he had been unusually bright during 
Kathie's visit to the city and afterward. Ah, had he a 
clew? 

" If anything true, and right, and honorable has been put 
out of your way, Rob, it is only held in the larger await- 
ing of by and by." 

" It was the one chance, the one glimpse of a lovely, sat- 
isfying life, and I think I have a right. You do not know ; 
as a clergyman, all secrets are sacred to you ; but I could 
have been quite free from that hateful marriage, that bo}r's 
folly ; I .can be now. Must I let all the great joys of 
life slip out for a mere figment of honor? And she is 
better. We heard this very day. Suppose she recovers ? 
Would you all send me back to that old existence ? Why, 
I might better never have left it ! " 

It would be better to go back than to stain any new life 
with a sin. Rob, you said one glimpse ; was it another?" 

" Yes," he flung out sullenly, " you may as well know 
all. I did not understand it myself until I heard to-day 
that she might go to some other love, not knowing, and I 
could win her, I am quite sure. I believe when I first met Fay 
Collamore I knew just the kind of woman I needed, high, 
honorable, gracious, true as steel, and as unflinching. Then 
I understood the madness I had yielded to and that had 
blurred all my life. I had no right to complain, and I 
did not. I kept to my own miserable path, shutting out 
my vision, making no comparison. When the time came 
that I might have been free I gave it up for others. And 
now she, who could so bless my life, will blight and wound 
her own, taking something less than she might have had, 
making herself content when there should be a sweet, spon- 
taneous joy. It ruins both ! Will it do that other misera- 
ble, negative existence any good? It discrowns love to 
apply it to any such disunion as ours was." 

A strong shudder ran through Robert Alston's frame, 





and the eyes were heavy, like one half asleep. But in the 
ot'ier face there was a strength and steadfastness not to be 
gainsaid. 

"Rob," he began gently, but in a firm, ringing tone, 
that gave no uncertain sound, " you were heroic through 
all that time. I think God helped you then. Some of the 
boyhood lessons lingered in your mind. It was a perilous 
way, and you came out of it morally unscathed, clearer- 
eyed, stronger, for every temptation overcome adds 
strength. And you know this night, as well as I, that 
yours would be an unhallowed love to offer to any woman. 
You are not free." 

'' Do you suppose I should offer it until I was ? " he 
asked almost savagely. 

" No, I have that much faith in you. You will not do 
it until your conscience is clear and clean, until your duty 
is done, until you can meet the eyes of every one, and how 
much more the one thus set above all others, in truth and 
honor. You said, back there, it was murder and all the 
long list ! You will not stain your soul, Robert Alston. 
You have not fought your way up to this to slip back ! " 

" What shall I do? " in a hollow, broken tone. " Why 
doesn't God save me ? " 

" Will you be saved? Will you be snatched from this 
fiery temptation ? Remember there was just one who met 
the Lord Jesus in the way , and who afterward carried 
about with him the ' marks ' in his body. To the others 
He said, ' Follow thou me/ Rise, you are able. Follow. 
Obey. Come to me." 

"Then I should save myself." 

" Well, can you? Have you come off victor by your 
own might? Are you so strong that you can pass by this 
thing without a longing ? Will you never shrink when it 
meets you in the way ? " 

" There is no use," gloomily. 

" There is use. See, Rob, you may have been betrayed 





into a word or look ; you and Fay may have seen for a 
moment a blinding, dazzling glare, but if you put it away 
before it has had time really to belong, it is all God asks. 
He might have made us insensible to all these things, and 
we should never have sinned, never even have seen the 
temptation. But it is braver, yes, I think it is better, to 
see and to resist. That, then, is not mere negative good- 
ness. That is accepting, using the divine strength, sup- 
plementing our weak desire with his greater aid, which is 
always sufficient if you will try it to the uttermost. The 
trouble is we so often try it only half or a little way." 

The midnight clocks were striking twelve. Rob dropped 
into a chair. He was suddenly tired, worn out. The face 
was ashen gray, the eyes lost their fire. 

" You will not throw away the victories of your life in 
this evil fashion. When it comes to deliberate choice you 
cannot." 

Could he do such a thing deliberately? Robert Alston 
paused to think. In a moment of selfish madness he might 
rush headlong, as he had been wild to do this evening, but 
seen here in all its. wrong and wretchedness 

There was along, long silence. Rob's temples throbbed 
like the blows of ceaseless machinery. He could not think 
clearly. Was there any ark of safety? 

" You remember our old hero, Rob! ' It is necessary 
for me to go ; it is not necessary for me to live.' It is 
necessary for you to be pure, and strong, and resolute. 
Other men have given up dreams " And his voice fal- 
tered a little. 

" Oh," cried Rob, " it was cruel to come to you ! " 

" No. I think you were led thither to see the salva- 
tion of God, for he will save you from yourself. And 
perhaps He showed me it had a wider significance, that I 
might comfort some one tried and tempest tossed.'' 

" Well, let it be given up, all of it. Let me come out 
o{ the horrible slough. For I could have wished the 





other dead to-night ; I am not sure but I did. How is it 
that one can never desire to do right first of all ? " 

" Because life must always be a warfare, to strong 
natures, especially. It is the old warring of the two 
natures, and even St. Paul, resolute and earnest, comforts 
us here. 'That which I would,' 'that which I would 
not,' and they are always present." 

" I make a poor soldier!" Robert Alston buried his 
face in his hands. And then he thought of another sol- 
dier who had fought as hard a battle, who had thrust out 
unlawful desire before it became blighting sin. 

" No, Rob, I think it is very fair. We are gauged by 
the strength of the temptation, and what might almost 
sweep you away would just touch another, who could not 
feel it so keenly." 

" Because I am so weak? " 

"No. You have shown your strength in many ways. 
You might have rushed into intemperance." 

A shudder of disgust passed over him. " I shall always 
hate drunkenness ! " he cried vehemently. 

" And you will come to hate and shun other things. It 
is not all done in a day. The vow is l a faithful soldier 
and servant to my life's end.' You have only begun." 

" Charlie," he said in a low tone, many moments after- 
ward, u could you have given up Kathie so readily if you 
had known another stood by to take her, that she was 
going quite out of your life ? " He must test the temper 
of this grace. 

" I did not give her up readily," in a lingering tone. 
"I think I understand. If Miss Collamore can go to 
another, Rob, it is quite certain that this is not, could not 
be the true regard of her life. And perhaps that is the 
cross for you, and the saving knowledge." 

And then an old thought came back to Charlie Darrell. 
They so seldom spoke of her in this connection. 

"Rob," he said softly, "did you ever imagine Kathie 
cared for, loved any one?" 





"I don't believe Kathie knows, and it is queer, too," 
brightening up a little ; " but yon see you all were so ready 
to do her honor. I can't understand how you all came to 
love her so ! She is not wonderfully beautiful nor regu- 
larly fascinating as some girls ; but she has been a little 
queen, with all her knights about her." 

Should he ask the question that he had more than once 
asked of his secret soul? 

Charlie turned his face away a little, that it might not 
show its anguish. 

" Did you ever fancy that Bruce " 

There was a silence that seemed almost deathly, in the 
room. A color fluttered up in the other's pallid face. 

" Rob ! " He came and stood over his friend, took his 
hand, studied the shrouded expression. 

It was drawn suddenly away. " Don't make me cruel 
to you of all others ! " cried Robert Alston, with a pang of 
remorse. 

' ' I fancied afterward Do you know when they mean 
to return ? " 

" Not until But I haven't any right to betray him. 
He would have cut off his hand or plucked out his right 
eye rather than have swerved a line " 

"Ah, you see it there ! " cried Charlie Darrell. " You 
cannot help honoring it, Rob ! Bruce Mackenzie is a 
Christian soldier." 

A Christian soldier. That had given the lovely grace of 
patience and steadfastness through all that tr}"ing time. 
That was what had interposed, when Rob first went out to 
Bruce, in his own behalf. He seemed to have found the 
clew, faint, wavering, but not uncertain. These two pos- 
sessed something he had not. His own strength, manly 
and robust, was not enough ; there wat a diviner grace. 
Yes, he must be saved, even if as by fire. His longing love 
might not desire it 

He rose then, almost overshadowing the slenderer figure. 
His step was uncertain, groping. 





" I think I have been a madman ! " he said in deepest 
humiliation. " I have gone to the very brink of destruction, 
trusting in my own might. But I shall never rest until I 
have found the greater strength. You need not be afraid 
to trust me." 

He started as if to go. " No, you will stay with me to- 
night," Charlie said. " It is late, and I want you to help 
me. If Bruce knew Kathie was quite free if I wrote 
they are going to Egypt soon, I believe. But he had bet- 
ter come home." 

" I wronged you a while ago. I said you did not 
know." 

" I do know. We both know that a love given away 
may grow into something higher than a love kept for one's 
self." 

" But yon have the right to give," he cried, bowing his 
head in an agony of shame. 

There was not much sleep for them that night. Robert 
Alston's thoughts would have kept him awake if it had 
not been for the almost intolerable headache. And he had 
been shown himself the thing he night become if left to 
his own devices, his human side, with no interposition. 
But he believed now that Fay Collamore could not have 
been tempted into any specious waiting, any wrong step, 
only he knew she had seen, and put away, like these other 
brave souls. There was a great deal of it to do in this 
world. 

Mr. Meredith rallied him somewhat the next day on his 
paleness, little dreaming of the struggle. He had one 
more duty before the new life could quite begin, and that 
was a letter to Uncle Robert, who came to answer it, in 
person. And Robert Alston realized then how easy it was 
to make the innocent suffer for the guilty. No one ever 
bore a crime or a shame quite alone. Some other heart 
was always wrung with anguish, often the one who should 
be nearest and dearest, first considered. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

THEY were in the glow and throb of mid-summer again. 
Kathie Alston stood on the wide balcony, nodding to baby 
Bertie below, who was making imaginary visits and com- 
ing back for cunning good-byes. Then espying Uncle Rob- 
ert, she ran like a sprite to meet him, and he caught her 
in his arms. 

Kathie ran down as well. She was radiant in health and 
brightness. All the cares and perplexities seemed over- 
past. She had simply to live, to take up the nearest duty. 

" I am jealous ! " laughingly. " I don't even have one 
arm any more." 

'But I must have one hand. Stand down a minute, 
Bertie ; I have a load of letters for Aunt Kathie. Doesn't 
that sound staid and ancient," smiling. "Here is one 
from Mrs. Truesdell, from Miss Fay ; and oh, what will 
you give me for my news ? " 

"A kiss used to be sufficient," with a piquant sparkle in 
her eye ; " but you have so many from my rival " 

"Take me up, Uncle Robert, take me up," said the 
imperious little queen. 

" A spoiled child ! What would become of her but for 
mamma and me ? And the news ? " 

"It is funny how many times we have said it. Aunt 
Ruth is in New York ; she is coming home to-morrow. I 
had a telegram." 

" Oh, how lovely ! So they gave up Egypt. Or did 
Bruce go on alone ? " 

" The telegram says ' we.'" 





" Oh, I do wonder The boys will be delighted ! Rob 
is fairly homesick for a sight of him." 

" Some letters for me?" demanded Bertie, as they sat 
down on the wide step. 

" There, this will do ; oh, no, this," giving her the tel- 
egram. " There was a letter from Chicago." 

" Uncle Robert," said Kathie seriously, " suppose she," 
nodding toward the letter, " should quite recover? " 

" That does not seem possible." 

" I have thought of it sometimes. What would Rob do? 
He has begun to be so curiously conscientious of late." 

" Why curious?" 

" Unusually, then. Do you know I think Rob singu- 
larly attracted by beautiful women. He always admired 
Fay Collamore greatly. And you all say she is so hand- 
some." 

" Her beauty alone could not win him back." 

" But duty might," Kathie returned gravely. " Still, we 
never could give up Bertie. It always seems to me as if 
her mother must be dead." 

Uncle Robert stooped to kiss the baby lips. u She is 
mine,", he said, " to comfort me after you all go away." 

Kathie smiled. She had been glancing over Fay's let- 
ter. Miss Collamore's episode had not culminated in an 
engagement ; why, she knew best. Just at that juncture 
Louise had been taken seriously ill with a fever, and Mr. 
Hunsdon had called on Fay's sisterly offices. On her par- 
tial recovery they had been sent to the mountains. 

"Mrs. Hunsdon is doing beautifully," Kathie announced ; 
" and oh, Dick Grayson is up there ! How odd they should 
stumble over each other ! " 

Then she opened Sarah's letter, and before she had 
read a dozen lines she uttered another exclamation. 

"Uncle Robert, listen to this. Mr. Truesdell has an ex- 
cellent call to Westport. The church is quite large, united, 
and flourishing, the salary very fair, and a house. Two 





of Sarah's pupils are married and settled there. It seems 
like such a splendid opportunity " 

" Well? " filling the pause. 

" To live a broader life. For, after all, there is just so 
much of a round in Middleville, and no more. They have 
conquered their place and a peace, I might say respect, for 
I do think Sarah's wise patience has served to unite and 
raise the very ordinary congregation. I should like to 
see her at her best estate. And Charlie has a high opin- 
ion of Mr. Truesdell." 

She could quote Charlie again quite comfortably. He 
would not let the break make a difference. Mrs. Alston 
had become quite reconciled, though he had said to her, 
" I cannot give up my old love for you ; it has in it all a 
son's reverence." 

Oddly -enough Charlie and Rob had been great friends 
of late. They all discerned a gradual change in the latter. 

" Rob is growing wonderfully like uncle," declared Fred 
daily. 

" I think Mr. Truesdell well fitted for a much larger 
sphere. I wondered at first how he could resign himself to 
the place, though there is a work everywhere." 

Mrs. Alston came out presently, and was delighted with 
the news. 

" I do think Ruth is very tired of rambling about," she 
said. u I hope now they have come to stay." 

Kathie arranged the guest chamber again, and made it 
sweet with flowers. Would Bruce come or not? How 
oddly quiet it would be this summer. Emma was away 
painting some seaside views that had been ordered. The 
olden, meny group were scattered far and wide ; even the 
Merediths were going elsewhere, and would not spend 
more than a fortnight at Brookside. 

Mrs. Alston and Kathie went over m the family carriage. 
There was dear Aunt Ruth, grown a little older, but sweet 
as ever, and the General, looking much better than last 
year. 





" And no Bruce ! " Kathie said. There was not a very 
keen disappointment in her tone. 

"Oh, the boys took possession of him at once ! I began 
to wonder if I had any rights in my own son," said the 
General with an assumption of injury. u I shall have to 
come to you for comfort, as I have times before." 

Kathie slipped her hand into his. It seemed almost like 
going back to the happy childhood when she first knew him. 
And she remembered how he had asked permission to bring 
Bruce to Cedarwood, that long-ago summer. 

" Am I to be left quite out in the cold? " she asked. 
" I am learning that the boys can do very well without me ; 
the end of youthful admiration, I suppose." 

They took up Uncle Robert at the post-office, and Bertie 
was running about the lawn watching for him. 

"How wonderfully like Rob in his babyhood !" Aunt 
Ruth said. 

" She is the happiest of all happy children," said Mrs. 
Alston. " I wonder at it sometimes ; but I think much 
of it is due to Mrs. Fleming's judicious nursing and train- 
ing. I am thankful she fell into such good hands." 

Cedarwood was so quiet and restful. It had that well- 
used home look, nothing obtrusive, nothing that had been 
thrust in, but the general growth of needed things, of 
beauty thought and planned year after year. The great 
porch now was rich in vines, that gave shade by day and 
sweetness at night. They went out in the evening and 
talked over the many happenings of the year and more 
since the last parting. 

Bruce was quite recovered in health and strength, but 
there would always be a little weakness about the hip joint 
that would need thoughtfulness, if not care, and would 
not admit of a life of hardship. He had sent in his army 
resignation and turned his attention to literary pursuits, in 
which he had done a little at the West. They would always 
have him now. 




Kathie listened with a thrill of interest. She wondered 
she had not suspected Bruce's penchant the winter of his 
illness, when they used to read and talk so much. 

He was to be down in a day or two. Rob meant to get 
a holiday and come with him. 

" I must congratulate you on your fine and manly son,
