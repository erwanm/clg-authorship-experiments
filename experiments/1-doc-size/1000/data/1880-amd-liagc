The carriage stopped. She glanced out at the well- 
known place, and a long breath of relief escaped her. 

" You have been so kind, such a true friend this night ; 
and you trust me so I You have not asked how I came to 
be in such peril ! But it would be cowardly and mean to 
take advantage of your your " 

" You do not take advantage. I give you my love." 

His arm was around her, and he lifted her out tenderly. 
In the darkness his lips just brushed against her cheek. 

"If I have been cold and distant," she cried with sudden 
heat, " it was because I felt that I was not only poor and 
obscure, but a dancing-girl. I have seen your family at the 
theatre, your mother, your stately and handsome grand- 
mother, and your two sisters. Do you suppose they would 
welcome me in their midst? They would think you had 
disgraced yourself irremediably. They would disown you. 
I wanted to believe that you were too honorable to say 
what it would be a shame for me to listen to ; and you will 
see, you must know, that it would not be right for me to 
take you at your word and promise no, I could not 
bring that trouble upon you." 


Then you do love me," he exclaimed, exultingly. "Il 
was because you thought of that, you sweet, foolish, noble 
girl ! Well, we are rich and grand, all we Grenvilles, and 
have some pure old blood in our veins ; and, somehow, you 
make me think of the old family portraits, among the 
women. Why, you are more beautiful, and as grand as 
any of them. And they cannot help loving you ! I am 
the only grandson, the last Grenville in the line, and it shall 
go hard with me if I cannot marry whom I like. But you 
are tired, and tremble like a poor frightened bird, and I 
must stay no longer. Good-night, my darling. You will 
not refuse to see me to-morrow. I shall be here in the 
morning." 

He rang the bell, and the hall-door was opened. One 
lingering, passionate kiss he pressed upon her lips with his 
murmured adieu, and was gone. 

" Was it nice ? " Tip asked, rubbing his sleepy eyes. 
"I will tell you about it to-morrow ; it is so late." 
Tip locked the door, and lighted another lamp, and with 
a kindly good-night they separated. 

Queenie took off her pretty dress, that had been such a 
delight to her. Should she ever like it again ? How could 
this awful mistake have come about ? And then the cruel, 
sneering face of Mam'selle Zelie rose up before her. Oh, if 
her stage life could but end here, for now it was hateful to 
her. The charm and romance had suddenly faded to glare 
and tinsel, and whispers, that made her cheek burn, even in 
this solitude. 

Strangely enough she never once thought of the escape 
offered that night. Harry Grenville might have ques- 
tioned her love if he could have looked into her heart. 

His brain was steeped in delicious dreams ; and he won- 
dered a little how she came to have so much the style and 
manner of his sisters, who had breathed an air of cultiva- 
tion ever since they were born. And she living in that 
mean old house, a stage-dancer ! 







CHAPTER XXXT. 

A BRAVE LOVER. 

TOWARDS morning Queenie fell into a troubled slumber, 
and slept late. When she came down Moppet was putting 
on her hat for school. The table had been cleared, but 
just at one corner Miss Madeira had spread a tempting 
breakfast. 

"Oh, you dear darling!" cried the child. "Auntie Ma- 
deira wouldn't let me steal in on tip-toe to kiss you ! So 
you went to a party last night? Are you very tired, and 
was it splendid ? Oh, there's the postman ! " and she ran 
to the hall door. 

" Oh, what a funny letter, auntie Madeira, look ! and the 
writing is like pa's, and it's foreign. Do open it quick, 
'Miss Bathsheba Madeira.' Oh, just suppose pa wasn't 
drowned after all ! " 

Miss Madeira settled her glasses, and studied it. Yes it 
was no, it could not be, and her fingers began to tremble 
with conflicting emotions, her eyes grew dim, and her heart 
was in a flutter. 

" Open it, Queenie,'' she said, faintly. 

Queenie broke the great seal. Out fluttered a queer 
looking paper, that Moppet seized on at once, and Queenie 
gave a great, joyful cry. 

" He is safe ! He is on his way home ! He was wrecked, 
and all that, but oh, isn't it wonderful ! " 

She flung her arms around Miss Madeira's neck. Moppet 
joined them, and the three cried together. Then Cissy 
added her voice, and the twins looked on with stolid 
wonder. 




Queenie laughed, and wiped ner eyes. " I suppose people 
do cry for joy sometimes ; and it's so splendid ! as good as 
my fairy stories, Moppet ; and somehow I never could be- 
lieve he was dead ; and oh, just to think of it ! " 

Then they all cried again, and Queenie's coffee grew 
cold, and the children had to have notes for being late at 
school. After they were out of the way Queenie read the 
letter again to Miss Madeira. It was quite a stirring story, 
and from it they learned that he had sent word a month 
or so before, which had never reached them. And enclosed 
was an order for one hundred dollars. Captain Mullins 
had found friends and employment, and would be with 
them by July. 

" Oh, Queenie, my dear darling! and you can leave the 
stage for good and all ! For though you've prospered, and 
had no misfortunes, the stage being considered such a 
temptation, and beauty a snare, though it seems to me I'd 
be sorry to have you otherwise, not being lifted up or vain 
about it. And you've saved the dear children, and kept 
them together, while my wits went wool-gathering; and 
the Lord will reward you, I know. I look to have some- 
thing out of the common order happen to you." 

Miss Madeira's face beamed with gratitude and hope, and 
was fairly transfigured. 

Suddenly Queenie bethought herself of her last night's 
adventure, and resolved to say nothing about it. There 
was but a week longer of stage life, and she would be very 
watchful. Madame Denzil would prove a better counsellor, 
and not take fright so easily as Miss Madeira. 

The thought of Mr. Grenville's proposal flashed over Ler 
Strangely enough, with all his earnestness, she had not 
been able to think seriously of it. Indeed, her time and 
interest had been so completely identified with this family, 
that leaving them seemed out of the question. And now 
suddenly she found herself free. A bright color mounted 





her cheek, and her pulses quickened. Could she, dare 
she love Harry Grenville ? 

He was to come presently for his answer. 

Somehow, now that the words had been spoken she 
could not feel surprised. Had interest turned to satiety 
already ? Only last night she had been full of fire and 
ambition ; to-day she was cold and inert. What did the 
crowd care for the toy that amused them ? There had 
once been a little Violetta, who had danced and died, and 
when she was put in the lost favorite's place, who thought 
of tears ? 

Yet she felt Harry Grenville's admiration was of another 
kind, with an element of honor in it. She had shunned 
him as well as the others, because she knew, as well as 
Madame Denzil could tell her, that these gifts, this adora- 
tion, that men were so free to lavish on a favorite of the 
stage, was not the meed of a true, high-toned respect. 

Why, then, did it not touch her ? Why did not her 
heart bound in gladness at the thought of his coming, at 
the consciousness of his love ? Was it merely because the 
laws and usages of society had placed so wide a gulf be- 
tween them ? With her youth and beauty she could well 
defy that. 

She rose languidly, and began to put the parlor in order. 
It was Peggy's day out, and Miss Madeira was busy in the 
kitchen, wiping the tears from her old eyes one moment, 
and smiling the next. It did not seem now as if they ever 
could have believed Captain Mullins dead. 

To Harry Grenville the hours were interminably long. 
He read the morning papers to his grandfather while he 
was partaking of his toast and coffee, and then he must 
needs decline going out with his mother on account of a 
pressing engagement. But he would not dare to present 
himself before Queenie until eleven, surely. 

"What is the matter with you this morning, Harry?" 





asked his handsome, sharp-eyed grandmother. "You are 
restless and nervous, and yet you look " 

" Well, grandmamma ; " and he laughed uneasily. 

" It is not a debt, nor an annoyance you look too 
happy. Is it some good news ? " 

" There, you have just hit it. Good news. Only, I am 
not quite sure that is I have not heard positively;" 
and he turned his flushing face toward the window. 

" You were at Mrs. Grantley's last evening ? n 

"Yes, of course." 

"And Miss Asheford was there?" 

" Yes. As blooming as ever." 

"You do like her, Harry ? " 

A frown crossed the fair brow, and the youth bit his lip. 

" Not in the way your tone implies, grandmamma." 

" But, my dear boy " 

"Haven't I said I would not be talked to about love 
matters ? There, grandmere," giving her a kiss, " do not 
question me any further. And I must go. Addio ; " wav- 
ing his hand across the room. 

" Remember your promise, Harry ! " she cried, springing 
up. " You are to tell me when you make your choice. 
Your grandpapa is so very exclusive and particular " 

But he was down-stairs, half laughing and half scolding 
as he went. 

" It is on the other side, my proud old grandmere," he 
was saying to himself. " If he saw Queenie once, at her 
best estate, he would surrender, I know, but it is you I 
shall have to fight. Ah, you cannot blind me, and yet you 
love me, I am aware. But Queenie " 

It was still early when he reached the house. What a 
poor-looking little place it was, to be sure ; and how noble 
she was to stay there and toil for those who were of no 
kin ! He had heard the story from Miss Fay. Ah, how 
glad he would be to take her out of it all, to keep her 
dressed in silks and laces, and have a maid to wait upon 





her, as his sisters had. Of course they would all be very, 
very angry at first ; but when they knew how good and 
beautiful she was, and how much in earnest he was, that 
he should never, never marry any one else, they would 
consent. He rather liked the prospect of a struggle for 
the fair girl, the romance and fervor, the sweet tenderness 
she would feel for him, and all her lovely, bewitching 
dependence. But he should always strive to make her 
understand that her beauty counterbalanced his wealth. 

He ventured to ring the door-bell at length. Queenie 
answered it, lending to the act her own sweet grace and 
dignity, instead of having it demean her. But she was 
very grave, and changed somehow, yet all the more lovable 
for the slight coldness that encircled her. 

" My darling " He dared to say that now. 

She turned away her face as she ushered him into the 
little parlor, with its dingy furniture made more shabby by 
the romping of children. There were a few choice flowers: 
he always took care that they awaited her every night. 
And with a lover's natural jealousy he liked the room bet- 
ter in that it had no token of other admirers. 

Queenie was a trifle embarrassed now. The shy brown 
eyes drooped, the color went and came in her blossom- 
like face, and the slender fingers interlaced each other 
nervously. 

"Queenie!" He was down by her side, with his arms 
around her. " My darling, you do love me a little ? I 
have not dreamed vainly " 

It was cruel to pain him, to crush his generous enthu- 
siasm, yet this was the task she had appointed for herself. 
She would not drag him down to her level. She would 
not shadow his life in the very beginning. 

I will not weary you with the pleading and the arguments. 
He was earnest, impassioned, royally regardless of obsta- 
cles, and accustomed to carry all before him, to convince 
any one that his way was best and right. He pictured 





for her a brilliant future ; and, though it tempted, she was 
steadfast to her own ideas of right and duty. 

" But if they consented to receive you, my darling ? I 
will not, cannot give you up ! I will wait years, until 
their patience is exhausted. I will look at no other wo- 
man. There is no son beside me, and there is a large 
fortune. One of my sisters is engaged to a wealthy 
Southerner, and the other will, no doubt, marry well. 
Nothing can ever shake my love for you !" 

He looked so manly and handsome that she could not 
help believing in him. Why did it seem so like playing aj 
love to her ? Was it because he was her first lover, and she 
was unused to the ardor and imperiousness of passion? 
Ah, where was that divine ineffable tenderness, that sacred 
reliance of first love ? For she seemed only tossed about, 
troubled and uncertain. 

He gained a compromise at length. If he could win the 
consent of his family, even after a struggle, she would 
yield. 

" You will give up the stage," he pleaded. " You have 
been so little known that the episode will soon be forgot- 
ten, and in your new sphere no one will ever be aware of it." 

" I shall have no need after this week, when my engage- 
ment ends." And then she told him the wonderful news 
concerning Captain Mullins. 

" Queenie," he said, with his glowing enthusiasm, " I 
think it one of the bravest and noblest things, that you 
should do just as you did. I shall always be proud of it, 
my darling." 

And there was the episode of last evening to be ex- 
plained, though she shuddered as she related it. 

His bright eyes grew stern as he listened, and the reso- 
lute lines about the mouth expressed his indignation as 
forcibly as any words could have done. 

" It was a vile plot on some one's part. Winstead had a 
hand in it; that is beyond question! I should like to 




horsewhip the cowardlj scoundrel. And I suspect yout 
Main'selle Zelie. You are sure of Madame Denzil's friend- 
ship." 

"Oh, I should as soon doubt her as you I" and 
Queenie smiled radiantly. 

" Then, when you have seen her, we can settle the rest, 
I want it left to me. Will you tell her ? " 

Queenie blushed, and shyly averted her eyes. 

" As you like," she answered, timidly. 

"I would like the whole world to know that you are my 
promised wife ! " was his proud answer. 

Miss Madeira had made ready their frugal meal, the 
noisy children had trooped home, clattered up and down 
the stairs, quarrelled because they were forbidden to rush 
in upon Queenie and her visitor, and now the house was 
silent once more. Harry Grenville lingered until he was 
ashamed of the small excuses he was compelled to bring 
forward, and at last bade Queenie a reluctant farewell, in- 
sisting upon the right to bring her home that evening. 

" Though it might be as well to ask your brother, as you 
call him. I will be generous," and he laughed gayly, with 
the assured faith of love. 

Poor Miss Madeira could scarcely comprehend this new 
phase of affairs. 

" If wonders don't stop I'm afraid I shall end my days 
in a lunatic asylum, on bread and water, and a strait 
jacket and a real marriage, my dear and poor brother- 
in-law coming up from the depths of the sea; but if 
ever man was thankful he ought to be to you ; and he 
isn't the worst, for I've noticed them as would let you 
work your fingers to the bone, and run your feet off, 
with never a thank'ee, but when it's born in 'em maybe 
they're not to blame, and you can't most always tell about 
decrees and fore-ordination, but I hope it's all scripture, as 
poor, dear father used to believe. He was a great stickler 
for it, my dear." 





Queeme tasted a few morsels, to please Miss Madeira, 
and then declared that it was absolutely necessary to see 
Madame Denzil. There was to be a grand benefit this 
evening for the pretty princess who had so enchanted the 
theatre-loving world with her startling adventures. There 
would be little opportunity for any confidence, and she 
felt that she could not wait. 

Dolly Denzil was at home, and alone, fortunately ; a little 
startled at her unexpected visitor, and alarmed at the pale 
face and weary eyes. 

" You little ghost ! " she cried. " Is this the way you 
keep your beauty for the benefit ? Ritchie expects us to be 
overwhelming ! Pet said, an hour ago, that the scramble 
for seats was positively disgraceful. Everything available 
is gone. What idiots the dear public are ! Won't you 
have a glass of wine ? What is the matter ? " 

" I have come to tell you," and the soft lips quivered. 
"Dear Madame Denzil, you have been so kind," and 
Queenie's arms dropped in the other's lap, with a weary 
motion. " So much has happened to me." 

" Well, little nun, I'll promise to be a lenient father-con- 
fessor," and the bright eyes sparkled mirthfully. 

" First, did you send for me last evening after I went 
home ? " 

"Send for you? Why, no!" in the utmost astonish- 
ment, opening her eyes very wide. 

"Then it was a plot! A cruel, cowardly plot!" was 
the excited exclamation. 

" What was ? You are as mysterious as the malevolent 
fairy. Who plotted ? Let me know at once ! " 

" But I am going to tell you ! " and Queenie went 
rapidly over the main incidents. Madame Denzil listened 
in the utmost surprise. 

" Zelie was at the bottom of it, you may be sure, though 
flint Winstcad has been besieging every one for an oppor- 
tunity to meet you. My little girl, I am so glad that you 





have been content to keep out of sight. These green-room 
acquaintances are seldom of much benefit, unless one cares 
just for the suppers, the presents, and the sham love. 
Once in a great while a man marries out of his own circle. 
Generally it is only pleasant pastime to him, while to the 
girl it may be the saddest earnest. But what hateful plan 
could Zelie have had, to throw you into that idiot's power! 
And what a strange ending ! Oh, my child, I shall have 
to take you and watch over you." 

She clasped the young girl to her heart, and kissed the 
pale lips with eager fondness. 

"But that was not the end," said Queenie in a low, 
strangling tone. 

"Was there a Scylla to the Charybdis? Surely, you 
have not allowed yourself " 

" He wants to marry me ! " cried Queenie, distressed 
beyond measure ; and her face crimsoned to its utmost 
capacity. 

" To marry you ? Are you quite sure, Queenie ? You 
are so young, so honest and trustful " 

" Let me tell you the rest," interposed the soft, entreat- 
ing voice." 

"Upon my word, Queenie Barretti, you have stumbled 
into a romance. An actual marriage ! And do you know 
it is said those Grenvilles are fabulously wealthy? I once 
gave the young man a bit of advice, for I did like him ; 
and that was to let stage performers alone, and not waste 
his substance upon their riotous living. He has heeded it 
beautifully." 

" But what must I do ? ' Queenie implored. 

" Do ? Why, marry him. You are lovely enough to 
grace any station, and two years at a good school would 
make you the peer of any modern young lady. I don't 
know that I should have stipulated for everybody's con- 
sent." 

" But if he should be sorry if he should repent after- 





frards when there was no help ? " Queenie asked, breath- 
lessly." 

" My dear, it's a trick they have. You know the judge 
sighed for the barefooted maiden ; but if he had married 
her he would have sighed for the heiress. Queenie, you 
are quite too young, too unworldly, to understand your 
own power. The kind of beautiful woman you will make 
ought to so fascinate her husband that he would hug his 
chain ; but you will be a sweet, yielding little fool, think- 
ing you owe him all gratitude, all humbleness ; and it will 
be the very way to tire him. Well, after all you were 
right not to fall too easily into his hands, like an over-ripe 
peach. If he is in earnest he can fight his way through a 
little opposition. Yet I cannot help believing he will 
prove to be your destiny. Fate arranges these things so 
oddly. To think that he should come to your rescue last 
night!" 

Queenie's hands dropped helplessly in her lap. If it 
was fate 

You told him that, all of it ? " 

" Yes ; and I was to ask you ; but I think it would be 
so much better to take no notice of it ; " and she shivered 
at the thought of figuring in even so slight a scandal. 

" Oh, much the wisest course. Act to-night just as if it 
had not occurred. Winstead will hardly be likely to boast, 
I think. Queenie, next week I am going to Chicago ; Pet 
and I have an engagement there. You must go with us 
for the rest and change. Let these Mullins people exist 
by themselves for a while. Surely you have done enough 
for them ! w 

" Oh, Madame Denzil," she cried, with a touch of real 
pain in her voice, " they will not need me in that way, any 
more. Captain Mullins is alive, and is coining home soon. 
And Miss Madeira is quite well " 

"And you are worn and tired. Your sweet face is so 
appealing that I want to take you in my arms and husb 





you to sleep. But have you any idea how the time ii 
going ? Will you stay and accompany me to the theatre ? 
If so you shall go to bed directly, and not be disturbed for 
the next two hours." 

" Oh, I cannot, I cannot ! " and Queeiiie sprang up. " I 
must go home at once." 

" There is not the slightest need. See here, I will send 
a note up to your Miss Madeira. There, not a word. 
Now I am going to put you on the sofa, and give you a 
little lavender. Don't worry yourself about another earthly 
thing. I shall put my threat into execution, and adopt 
you, and carry you off with me. Then I shall keep watch 
of that young man ; and if he isn't very deserving he will 
find himself shipped off in a hurry. Poor, tired little 
thing, you want some one to take care of you, and scold 
you, and pet you ; and I am just the person ! " 

She bustled about and overruled Queenie, who was too 
nearly worn out to make much of a resistance. When 
Madame Denzil had her all nice and quiet she opened a 
book of poems, and began to read. Thinking of the old 
times, and Dick Bridger, Queenie dropped into a tranquil 
slumber. 







CHAPTER XXXTL 

IS IT TOO LATE? 

PALACE GARDEN was crowded. The music was more 
entrancing than ever, the stage accessories had been fresh- 
ened up, the actors and actresses were full of life and 
spirit. Elegant ladies nodded and smiled, and made the 
air fragrant with their scented fans and delicious bouquets. 
Mademoiselle Zanfretti was startlingly lovely, and more 
sylph-like than ever. The first glimpse of her was greeted 
with rapturous applause. 

Some distance away there was another episode transpir- 
ing that concerned her more nearly than she dreamed. It 
was almost nine when the bell of an elegant up-town resi- 
dence was answered by the polite waiter. 

"Is Mr. Byington in?" asked a full, hearty voice that 
you would imagine belonged to this robust, stalwart frame 
and vigorous, though not handsome face. " Will you hand 
him that card ? I will wait here in the vestibule." 

The servant returned in a moment. "The gentleman 
was to walk into the library." 

The young man glanced around at the evidences of 
wealth and refinement, and smiled a little at the subtile 
odor of a cigar. 

" Ah, Mr. Chafney," said the cordial voice of Mr. Bying- 
ton, and the same kindly face smiled on him that had in 
the by-gone years roused his ambition to be somebody; 
" but you grow and change almost out of one's recollection. 
You are well, I hope ? " 

"Very well. And yourself and family ? " 

You would hardly have guessed that this sturdy, honest, 





open-faced young man could have been the little street 
Arab, Tim Chafney. Yet so it was. Mr. Byington's 
efforts had been assisted by the boy's ambition and resolve. 
He had not only acquired a profitable and excellent trade, 
but what with evening schools and reading-rooms he had 
made himself master of a very fair education. 

He answered Mr. Byington's inquiries concerning him- 
self in a very satisfactory manner, and was congratulated 
upon the improvement he had made. 

" It's most kind of you, Mr. Byington, to take an interest 
in me," said Tim, with frank gratitude. " But I didn't 
come for that this evening. You have not forgotten the 
little Nora that brought me all my good fortune ? I feel 
sometimes as if it was cruel to be happy and prosperous, 
while she is no one knows where. And I have heard 
something about her." 

Mr. Byington sprang up, excitedly. 

" No, Tim ! " he exclaimed, as if he could hardly believe it. 

" I don't know whether it will prove a clue or not," said 
Tim, rather uncertainly. "And it's that cruel and wicked ! 
If she had not been dying " 

"She? Not the child?" 

oh, no, sir," eagerly. " You knew about the woman 
my father married Mother Mell, as she was called. She 
was a bold, handsome, bad sort of woman, and for two or 
three years I've heard nothing of her. She is dying in 
BeJevue; is dead, I suppose, by this time. I was up 
there this morning. She sent for me last week, but the 
word was delayed." 

"And you heard about Nora?" 

"I heard yes, sir. You see, Mell was desperately 
jealous because my father took a liking to this little Nora, 
and she took her off and sold her.". 

" Sold her ! To whom ? Poor, sweet little child." 

" She sold her to a man who was a sort of receiver for 
stolen goods, or rather who passed on valuables and made 





bargains. And when any one wanted a child for any spe- 
cial purpose, this man, it seems, managed to get possession 
of the required article." 

"And this in our own city! You amaze me." 

" Mell said that children were sometimes taken there 
and kept for big rewards, sometimes sold to street musi- 
cians, and for various purposes." 

" But we offered a reward," said Mr. Byington. 

" Yes. Mell had no idea the child was valuable. She 
had no rich clothes or jewelry about her. But after she 
heard, she tried to get her back, and this man, Retzer, had 
sold her again." 

"That sounds incredible, Tim." 

" But this is the cruellest part. She would not tell Ret- 
zer, lest he might claim the reward, and he would give her 
no information as to where the child had really gone. To 
think that she might have been found ! And oh, sir, not 
to know anything about her ! Why, she would be a young 
lady by this time I counted it up. She was such a 
beautiful little thing! I can see her now, just like a pic- 
ture. Mell thinks she was taken out of the city." 

"But this man, Retzer, did you call him, can we 
not find him, Tim ? Money would be no object. There 
is her father." 

"Oh, sir, isn't it hard?" and Tim winked away some 
tears. "Mell told me where he was, and I went to the 
place. It had been a regular hole, a resort for thieves and 
desperadoes. In April the property was sold, and the 
houses torn down. They are going to build a row of brick 
tenements. And Retzer went to Germany sailed the 
twentieth of April." 

" There certainly is a fatality attending the child. We 
seem to come upon the traces always too late. You are 
sure this Mell told the truth ?" 

" Oh, yes. She seemed sorry and penitent like, and 
when I told her Nora's father had come back, and was a 





great gentleman, the tears just rolled out of her eyes, for 
she was too weak to cry. The doctor said she had been 
dying for hours. She couldn't have told such a lie with 
her last breath, when she could barely speak." 

" No, Tim, that would be too terrible. But if she had 
spoken sooner ! " 

" I found a friend of Retzer's they're all mighty sus- 
picious, sir, unless it is of people like themselves. I 
learned that he had a brother at Hamburg, and have the 
address. I made this man believe it would be greatly to 
Retzer's advantage, and I hardly think he would deceive 
so grossly." 

"You have a long head, Tim," and Mr. Byington 
smiled. "I know a mercantile house at Hamburg, and 
they can do the business through some attorney. We 
will offer a liberal reward for the information." 

" Couldn't her father do something ? " asked the young 
man, eagerly. 

"Why, yes. How stupid not to think of it. And yet 
it seems such a painful story to tell him. But we had bet- 
ter. Will you give me the address?" 

Tim produced it, and also the confession, to which 
Mother Mell had appended her scrawl, in the presence of 
the physician. 

" I shall spare no pains, and yet I have very little hope. 
If we should find her, with the changes and chances of 
years between " 

" Oh, sir, she couldn't be anything but what she was 
then. I can't fancy her growing loud and coarse and 
common. I am only afraid that she has been hardly used ; 
and she was such a sweet little angel. Maybe I'd better 
not have taken her in when she clung to me so that day." 

"Oh, Tim, don't reproach yourself. But for you we 
might not even have known these few facts." 

"And by fall we can learn what Retzer will tell us. Oh, 






Mr. Byington, let us keep up heart a while longer. Some- 
how this has given me a new hope." 

They parted very cordially. Mr. Byington went to his 
wife's sitting-room, and paused before the portrait of the 
lovely child. 

"Oh, Edward!" and Mrs. Byington sprang up. "You 
have not heard anything of our little Nora?" 

They always said, "Our Little Nora." The child they 
had never seen was at once an expectation, and, singularly 
enough, held all the grace of a past possession. More than 
this, she was theirs. The real child would have a father 
and a home, this shadowy being could not be taken from 
them. 

"Oh, you have," she cried, impetuously, as he made no 
answer. 

"My dear wife, a man of any discretion would keep this 
to himself," and he smiled down on the eager face, " but I 
shall have to tell you, of course, even at the risk of a heart- 
ache. It is the second real link in the chain, and yet we 
may never reach the end." 

Then he recapitulated the particulars of Tim's call, and 
the slender thread they had on which to build a hope. 

"How strange," she said, after they had discussed it in 
all its bearings, " that, to-morrow, Roger comes home. He 
always took such a curious interest in the child ; and he 
more than half believes that little acrobat was Nora, I 
wish we had taken more pains to find out, for it seems 
quite possible now that she might have been sold for some 
such purpose. And his hunting up that Mrs. Chippenham, 
who was Barretti's wife,, may be of some real service. Oh, 
poor little children! How many of them are sinned 
against in this world ! ' 

' Why, it would be odd if Roger found another link. 
But the little girl he traced ran away from some place, did 
she not ? I think she would be likely to go on the stage 
again. Are there any famous gol den -haired young women 
acrobats ? " 





" Oh, I hope she has not taken to the stage," cried Mrs. 
Byington. "I have never had any faith in Roger's 
protege, but just now I have a presentiment, or a mis- 
giving " 

" Wait until we see him ; and, above all, let us say noth- 
ing to Maggie." 

The steamer had been signalled late that afternoon, and 
the next morning Mr. and Mrs. Byington drove down to 
the wharf in the carriage. Roger had been two years 
abroad, and he had left George at school in a quaint old 
German town. 

Mrs. Byington sat there impatiently, while the legal for- 
mula was being complied with. And then her husband 
came elbowing his way through the crowd, with a tall, 
handsome, laughing fellow on his arm, whose creamy skin 
was like fine bronze, and whose magnificent eyes were 
more brilliant than ever, while a luxuriant moustache gave 
him an oriental air. 

" Aunt Alice ! " " Roger ! " 

They said it in a breath. No mother could be prouder 
of him than she was, or more thankful for the health, 
honor, and purity shining in the sunny face. 

" I've just been explaining to uncle Edward that I 
brought home that poor Mrs. Chippenham. She is to go to 
a quiet lodging-house, with another passenger. Oh, aunt 
Alice ! " and the handsome face was all alight. 

"I can guess, Roger. The little Queen Titania was 
Nora. If I had gone, that day, at Seaview ! " 

"Yes. It is an odd story, quite a romance, in fact. Mrs. 
Chippenham heard that she died in a hospital. She is liv- 
ing yet, I am sure, and all the rest is easy. It is only to 
advertise for the little Queen Titania. But oh, how are 
you all, and dear Lai ? I've thought so much about Nora 
that I can hardly get her out of my mind. But it is so de- 
lightful to see your faces once more, and to be at home, 
Have I changed much ? " 



" Yes, and no. But I will forgive your talking about 
Nora. We can come to ourselves afterward. What proof 
have you ? " 

" Nothing but the child's story, and the dates. She 
went to this Dick Bridger the very day of her second dis- 
appearance. He found her, or obtained her somewhere in 
New York. She told the story of her losing Maggie in 
the street, of Tim Chafney befriending her, and that horrid 
hag of a mother Mell, who took her to the house from 
whence Dick Bridger carried her away." 

" And your hero, your wonderful athlete bought her like 
a little slave. At least, mother Mell sold her. We heard 
BO last evening," said Mrs. Byington, bitterly. 

"I fancied it must have been something like that from 
what Mrs. Chippenham said. And yet she might have 
fallen into worse hands. What puzzled me about it is that 
neither of them saw the advertisement." 

"And she remembered her being lost Maggie, and 
all? Edward, it will be hardly worth while to bother 
about that man Retzer. When can we see Mrs. Chippen- 
ham ? How fortunate that you brought her home." 

" Poor thing ! And yet she amuses me. With a kindly 
heart, she has so little common sense. She had quite a 
fortune when she married this man Chippenham. She 
rave it all to him, and was persuaded to hire out this little 
Queen Titania. He has spent it, is a miserable drunkard 
and gambler, has treated her cruelly, and now she has left 
him. Indeed, I found her living at service in an American 
family ; but the scoundrel managed to get her wages." 

"If we can but find her! I do think she would natu- 
rally return to the stage," said Mr. Byington. " Do you 
know it will soon be nine years since she was lost." 

" All her sweet young life ! " exclaimed Mrs. Byington, 
regretfully. " And now one cannot tell what she will be." 

"Do you know, aunt Alice, I have the utmost faith in 
her, the greatest hope for her. She was such a noble, 





truthful little girl. Mrs. Chippenham has related so many 
touching incidents about her. I do not see how she could 
bear to give up the child. She said Nora would not tell a 
lie to save herself from any punishment, and she raves 
about the child's beauty. I believe the woman from whom 
she ran away misrepresented her horribly." 

Mrs. Byington sighed. She could not be as hopeful as 
Roger. She knew how many temptations there were for a 
girl, young and beautiful; and even if she had committed 
no overt act, she must, nearly all these years, have been 
without any elevating or refining influences. 

They reached the house presently, and then the proud 
and fond aunt saw more clearly the improvement there had 
been in Roger the last two years. How delighted his 
father would be ! No traces of dissipation in that health- 
ful eye, or glowing cheek, while his bearing and manners 
had the courteous refinement of a true gentleman. 

"I think," he said, some time after lunch, "that I had 
better bring Mrs. Chippenham up here, and we will all go 
overt the case. There must be no possibility of a mistake. 
Then when we advertise we will send a copy to every the- 
atrical manager of any note in the country." 

He was so engrossed, however, that he did not set out 
to seek Mrs. Chippenham until the next morning. She 
was still much fatigued from her journey, and affected by 
the great change in her fortunes. 

Poor Kate. Dearly had she paid for her folly in listen- 
ing to Chippenham's delusive love t:ile. She had been 
slow to suspect, and even her suspicions were easily allayed 
at first. Ignorant of business, and the management of 
property, she did not know that he was squandering right 
and left, on his own foolish experiments, until it was gone. 
Then casual neglect turned into habitual indifference. 
When Kate ventured on a rather fretful remonstrance, she 
found that instead of a master she had a tyrant. Dia- 
monds, valuable laces, and silks, were parted with, and 





when she was forced to take a service-place to keep from 
absolute starvation her once adored husband, now a 
brutish drunkard, did not hesitate to use threats to extort 
a part of her wages. How thankful she was when Roger 
Lasselle dropped down upon her, questioned her, and heard 
in return her rambling, complaining story, and offered to 
take her back to America. She shed tears of gratitude, 
and was eagerly, childishly delighted with the news that 
Queenie was not dead. 

The years had aged and changed her a good deal. The 
glossy back hair had many a silver thread, and the once 
comely face looked faded, haggard ; the figure had de- 
veloped into middle-aged stoutness. It was hardly in
