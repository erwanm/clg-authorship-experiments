of the rooms, but it was not very light at noonday 
without the gas, which the bell-boy now flared up 
for them. The uproar of the city came to it in a 
soothing murmur, and they took posession of its 
peace and comfort with open celebration. After all. 



 

they agreed, there v:o.s no place in the world so de- 
lightful as a hotel apartment like that ; the boasted 
charms of home -were nothing to it ; and then the 
magic of its being always there, ready for any one, 
every one, just as if it were for some one alone : it 
was like the experience of an Arabian Xights hero 
come true for all the race. 

" Oh, why can't we always stay here, just we two ! " 
Mrs. March sighed to her husband, as he came out 
of his room rubbing his face red with the towel, 
while she studied a new arrangement of her bonnet 
and hand-bog on the mantel. 

" And ignore the past ] I 'm willing. I "vc no 
doubt that the children could get on perfectly well 
without us, and could find some lot in the scheme of 
Providence that would really be just a.s well for 
them." 

" Yes ; or could contrive somehow never to have 
existed. I should insist upon that. If they are, 
don't you see that we couldn't wish them not to be ? " 

" Oh yes ; I see your point ; it 's simply incon- 
trovertible." 

She laughed, and said : " "Well, at any rate, if we 
can't find a flat to suit us we can all crowd into 
these three rooms somehow, for the winter, and 
then browse about for meals. By the week we 
could get them much cheaper ; and we could save 
on the eating, as they do in Europe. Or on some- 
thing else." 

" Something else, probably," said March. " But 
we won't take this opartment till the ideal furnished 


 

flat winks out altogether. We shall not h:vve .iny 
trouble. We can easily find some one avIio is going 
South for the winter, and will be glad to give up 
their flat ' to the right party ' at a nominal rent. 
That 's my notion. That 's what the Evanses did 
one winter when they came on here in February. 
All but the nominality of the rent." 

" Yes, and we could pay a very good rent and 
still save something on letting our house. You can 
settle yourselves in a hundred diff'erent ways in New 
York, that is one merit of the place. But if every- 
thing else fails, we can come back to this. I want 
you to take the refusal of it, Basil. And we 'll com- 
mence looking this very evening as soon as we 've 
had dinner. I cut a lot of things out of the Herald 
as we came on. See here ! " 

She took a long strip of paper out of her hand- 
bag with minute advertisements junned transversely 
upon it, and forming the effect of some glittering 
nondescript vertebrate. 

"Looks something like the sea-serpent," said 
March, drying his hands on the towel, while he 
glanced up and down the list. "But we shan't 
have any trouble. I 've no doubt there are half a 
dozen things there that will do. You haven't gone 
up-town ? Because we must be near the Ereri Other 
Week ofiice." 

" No ; but I tvish Mr. Fulkerson hadn't called it 
that ! It always makes one think of 'jam yesterday 
and jam to-morrow, but never jam to-day,' in Through 
the Looking-glass. They're all in this region." 



 

They were still at their table, beside a low window, 
whei'e some sort of never-blooming shrub symme- 
trically balanced itself in a large pot, with a leaf to 
the right and a leaf to the left and a spear up 
the middle, when Fulkerson came stepping square- 
footedly over the thick dining-room carpet. He 
wagged in the air a gay hand of salutation at sight 
of them, and of repression when they offered to rise 
to meet him ; then, with an apparent simultaneity 
of action he gave a hand to each, pulled up a chair 
from the next table, put his hat and stick on the 
floor beside it, and seated himself. 

"Well, you've burnt your ships behind you, sure 
enough," he said, beaming his satisfaction upon 
them from eyes and teeth. 

" The ships are burnt," said March, " though I 'm 
not sure we did it alone. But here we are, looking 
for shelter, and a little anxious about the disposition 
of the natives." 

" Oh, they 're an awful peaceable lot," said Ful- 
kerson. " I 've been round amongst the caciques a 
little, and I think I 've got two or three places that 
will just suit you, Mrs. March. How did you leave 
the children ? " 

" Oh, how kind of you ! Very well, and very 
proud to be left in charge of the smoking wrecks." 

Fulkerson naturally paid no attention to what she 
said, being but secondarily interested in the chil- 
dren at the best. " Here are some things right in 
this neighbourhood, within gunshot of the office, 
and if you want you can go and look at them to- 


night ; the agents gave me houses where the people 
woukl be in." 

" "We will go and look at them instantly" said 
Mrs. March. "Or, as soon as you've had coffee 
with us." 

" Never do," Fulkerson replied. He gathered up 
his hat and stick. " Just rushed in to say Hello, 
and got to run right away again. I tell you, March, 
things are humming. I 'm after those fellows with 
a sharp stick all the while to keei) them from 
loafing on my house, and at the same time I 'm just 
bubbling over with ideas about The Lone Hand — 
wish we could call it that ! — that I want to talk 
with you." 

" Well, come to breakfast," said Mrs. March cor- 
dially. 

" No ; the ideas will keep till you 've secured 
your lodge in this vast wilderness. Good-bye." 

"You're as nice as you can be, Mr. Fulkerson," 
she said, " to keep us in mind when you have so 
much to occupy you." 

" I wouldn't have anyih.\ng to occupy me if I 
hadn't kept yon in mind, IMrs. March," said Ful- 
kerson, going off upon as good a speech as he could 
apparently hope to make. 

"Why, Basil," said Mrs. March, when he was 
gone, " he 's charming ! But now we mustn't lose 
an instant. Let's sec where the places are." She 
ran over the half-dozen agents' permits. "Capital 
— first-rate — the very thing— every one. "Well, I 
consider ourselves settled ! "We can go back to the 
children to-morrow if we like, though I rather tliink 



 

I should like to stay over another day and got a 
little rested for the final pulling up that's got to 
come. But this simplifies everything enormously, 
and Mr. Fulkerson is as thoughtful and as sweet as 
he can be. I know you will get on well with him. 
He has such a good heart. And his attitude toward 
you, Basil, is beautiful always — so respectful ; or not 
that so much as appreciative. Yes, apjireciative — 
that 's the word ; I must always keep that in mind." 

" It 's quite important to do so," said March. 

" Yes," she assented seriously, " and we must not 
forget just what kind of flat we are going to look 
for. The sine qua nons are an elevator and steam- 
heat, not above the third floor, to begin with. Then 
we must each have a room, and you must have your 
study and I must have my parlour ; and the two girls 
must each have a room. "With the kitchen and 
dining-room, how many does that make ? " 

"Ten." 

"I thought eight. Well, no matter. You can 
work in the parlour, and run into your bedroom when 
anybody comes ; and I can sit in mine, and the girls 
must put up with one, if it 's large and sunny, though 
I 've always given them two at home. And the 
kitchen must be sunny, so they can sit in it. And 
the rooms must all have outside light. And the 
rent must not be over eight hundred for the winter. 
V\''e only get a thousand for our whole house, and 
we must save something out of that, so as to cover 
the expenses of moving. Now, do you think you 
can remember all that ? " 

" Not the half of it," said March. " But you can ; 



 

or if you forget a third of it, I can come in with my 
partial half, and more than make it up." 

She had brought her bonnet and sack downstairs 
with her, and was transferring them from the hat- 
rack to her person while she talked. The friendly 
door-boy let them into the street, and the clear 
October evening air inspirited her so, that as she 
tucked her hand under her husband's arm and began 
to pull him along, she said, "If we find something 
right away — and we 're just as likely to get the right 
flat soon as late ; it 's all a lottery — we 'll go to the 
theatre somewhere." 

She had a moment's panic about having left the 
agents' permits on the table, and after remembering 
that she had put them into her little shopping-bag, 
where she kept her money (each note crushed into 
a round wad), and had left that on the hat-rack, 
where it would certainly be stolen, she found it on 
her wrist. She did not think that very funny, but 
after a first impulse to inculpate her husband, she 
let him laugh, while they stopped under a lamp, and 
she held the permits half a yard away to read the 
numbers on them. 

" Where are your glasses, Isabel ? " 
"On the mantel in our room, of course." 
" Then j'ou ought to have brought a pair of tongs." 
" I wouldn't get off second-hand jokes, Basil," she 
said ; and " Why, here ! " she cried, whirling round 
to the door before which they had halted, " this is 
the very number. Well, I do believe it 's a sign ! " 
One of those coloured men who soften the trade of 



 

janitor in many of the smaller apartment houses in 
New York by the sweetness of their race, let the 
Marches in, or, rather, welcomed them to the pos- 
session of the premises by the bow with which ho 
acknowledged their permit. It was a large, old 
mansion cut up into five or six dwellings, but it had 
kept some traits of its former dignity, which pleased 
people of their sympathetic tastes. The dark 
mahogany trim, of sufficiently ugly design, gave a 
rich gloom to the hallway, which was wide, and 
paved with marble ; the carpeted stairs curved aloft 
through a generous space. 

" There is no elevator ? " Mrs. March asked of the 
janitor. 

He answered, " No, ma'am ; only two flights up," 
so winningly that she said — 

"Oh! "in courteous apology, and whispered, her 
husband as she followed lightly up, " We 'll take it, 
Basil, if it's like the rest." 

" If it 's like him, you mean." 

" I don't wonder they wanted to own them," she 
hurriedly philosophised. " If I had such a creature, 
nothing but death should part us, and I should no 
more think of giving him his freedom ! " 

"No; we couldn't afford it," returned her husband. 

The apartment the janitor unlocked for them, and 
lit up from those chandeliers and brackets of gilt 
brass in the form of vine bunches, leaves, and ten- 
drils in which the early gas-fitter realised most of his 
conceptions of beauty, had rather more of the ugliness 
than the dignity of the hall. But the rooms were 



 

large, and they grouped themselves in a reminiscence 
of the time when they were part of a dwelhng, that 
had its charm, its pathos, its impressiveness. Where 
they were cut up into smaller spaces, it had been 
done with the frankness with which a proud old 
family of fallen fortunes practises its economies. 
The rough pine floors showed a black border of tack- 
heads where carpets had been lifted and put down 
for generations ; the white paint was yellow with 
age ; the apartment had light at the front and at the 
back, and two or three rooms had glimpses of the 
day through small windows let into their corners ; 
another one seemed lifting an appealing eye to 
heaven through a glass circle in its ceiling ; the rest 
must darkle in perpetual twilight. Yet something 
pleased in it all, and Mrs. March had gone far to 
adapt the different rooms to the members of her 
family, when she suddenly thought (and for her to 
think was to say), " Why, but there 's no steam- 
heat ! " 

'' No, ma'am," the janitor admitted, " But dere 's 
grates in most o' de rooms, and dere 's furnace-heat 
in de halls." 

" That 's true," she admitted, and having placed 
her family in the apartments, it was hard to get 
them out again. " Could we manage ? " she referred 
to her husband. 

" Why, I shouldn't care for the steam-heat if 

What is the rent ? " lie broke off to ask the janitor. 

" Nine hundred, sir." 

March concluded to his wife, "If it were furnished. 

" Why, of course ! "What could I have been think- 
ing of ? "We 're looking for a furnished flat," she 
explained to the janitor, " and this was so pleasant 
and home-like, that I never thought whether it was 
furnished or not." 

She smiled upon the janitor, and ho entered into 
the joke and chuckled so amiably at her flattering 
oversight on the way downstairs that she said, as 
she pinched her husband's arm, " Now, if you don't 
give him a quarter, I 'll never speak to you again, 
Easil ! " 

" I would have given half a dollar willingly to gel> 
you beyond his glamour," said March, when they 
were safely on the pavement outside. " If it hadn't 
been for my strength of character, you 'd have taken 
an unfurnished flat without heat and with no elevator, 
at nine hundred a year, when you had just sworn 
me to steam-heat, an elevator, furniture, and eight 
hundred." 

" Yes ! How could I have lost my head so com- 
pletely ? " she said, with a lenient amusement in her 
aberration which she was not always able to feel in 
her husband's. 

" The next time a coloured janitor opens the door 
to us, I 'll tell him the apartment doesn't suit at the 
threshold. It 's the only way to manage you, Isabel." 

" It 's true. I am in love with the whole race, I 
never saw one of them that didn't have perfectly 
angelic manners. I think we shall all be black in 
heaven — that is, black-souled." 

'' That isn't the usual theory," said March. 

 

"Well, perhaps not," she assented. "Where are 
 we going now ? Oh yes, to the Xcuophon ! " 

She pulled him gaily along again, and after they 
had walked a block down and half a block over, 
they stood before the apartment-house of that name, 
which was cut on the gas lamps on either side of the 
heavily spiked, resthetic-hinged black door. The 
titter of an electric bell brought a large, fat Buttons, 
with a stage effect of being dressed to look small, 
who said he would call the janitor, and they waited 
in the dimly splendid, copper-coloured interior, admir- 
ing the whorls and waves into which the wall-paint 
was combed, till the janitor came in his gold-banded 
cap, like a continental courrier. When they said they 
would like to see Mrs. Grosvenor Green's apartment 
he owned his inability to cope with the affair, and 
said he must send for the Superintendent ; he was 
cither in the Herodotus or the Thucydides, and 
would be there in a minute. The Buttons brought 
him — a Yankee of browbeating presence in plain 
clothes — almost before they had time to exchange a 
frightened whisper in recognition of the fact that 
there could be no doubt of the steam-heat and 
elevator in this case. Half stifled in the one, they 
mounted in the other eight stories, while they tried 
to keep their self-respect under the gaze of the 
Superintendent, which they felt was classing and 
assessing them with unfriendly accuracy. They 
could not, and they faltered abashed at the threshold 
of Mrs. Grosvenor Green's apartment, while the 
Superintendent lit the gas in the gangway that he 



 

called a private hall, and in the drawing-room and 
the succession of chambers stretching rearward to 
the kitchen. Everything had been done by the 
architect to save space, and everything to waste it 
by Mrs. Grosvenor Green. She had conformed to a 
law for the necessity of turning round in each room, 
and had folding-beds in the chambers ; but there her 
subordination had ended, and wherever you might 
have turned round she had put a gimcrack so that 
you would knock it over if you did turn. The place 
was rather pretty and even imposing at first glance, 
and it took several joint ballots for March and his 
wife to make sure that with the kitchen there were 
only six rooms. At every door hung a portiere 
from large rings on a brass rod ; every shelf and 
dressing-case and mantel was littered with gim- 
cracks, and the corners of the tiny rooms were 
curtained off, and behind these portieres swarmed 
more gimcracks. The front of the upright piano 
had what March called a short-skirted portiere on 
it, and the top was covered with vases, M-ith dragon 
candlesticks, and with Jap fans, whicli also expanded 
themselves bat-wise on the walls between the etch- 
ings and the water-colours. The floors were covered 
with filling, and then rugs, and then skins ; the 
easy-chairs all had tidies, Armenian and Turkish 
and Persian ; the lounges and sofas had embroidered 
cushions hidden under tidies. The radiator was 
concealed by a Jap screen, and over the top of this 
some Arab scarfs were flung. There was a super- 
abundance of clocks. China pugs guarded the 




hearth ; a brass sunflower smiled from the top of 
cither andiron, and a brass peacock spread its tail 
before them inside a high filigree fender; on one 
side was a coal-hod in repoussd brass, and on the 
other a wrought-iron wood-basket. Some red Japan- 
ese bird-kites were stuck about in the necks of 
spelter vases, a crimson Jap umbrella hung opened 
beneath the chandelier, and each globe had a shade 
of yellow silk. 

March, wIru ho had recovered his self-command 
a little in the presence of the agglomeration, com- 
forted himself by calling the bric-a-brac Jamescracks, 
as if this was their full name. 

The disrespect he was able to show the whole 
apartment by means of this joke strengthened him 
to say boldly to the Superintendent that it was 
altogether too small ; then he asked carelessly what 
the rent was. 

" Two hundred and fifty." 

The Marches gave a start, and looked at each other. 

" Don't you think we could make it do ? " she 
asked him, and he could see that .she had mentally 
saved five hundred dollars as the difference between 
the rent of their house and that of this flat. " It has 
some very pretty features, and we could manage to 
squeeze in, couldn't we ? " 

" You won't find another furnished flat like it for 
no twO fifty a month in the whole city," the Superin- 
tendent put in. 

They exchanged glances again, and March said 
carelessly, " It 's too small." 



A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES. Gl 

" There 's a vacant flat in the Herodotus for 
eighteen hundred a year, and one in the Thucydides 
for fifteen," the Superintendent suggested, clicking 
his keys together as they sank down in the elevator ; 
" seven rooms and a bath." 

" Thank you," said March, " we 're looking for a 
burnished flat." 

They felt that the Superintendent parted from 
them with repressed sarcasm. 

'' Basil, do you think we really made him think 
it was the smallness and not the dearness ? " 

" No, but we saved our self-respect in the attempt ; 
and that 's a great deal." 

" Of course, I icoiddn't have taken it, anyway, with 
only six rooms, and so high up. But what prices ! 
Now, we must be very circumspect about the next 
place." 

It was a janitress, large, fat, with her arms wound 
up in her apron, who received them there. !Mrs. 
March gave her a succinct but perfect statement of 
their needs. She failed to grasp the nature of them, 
or feigned to do so. She shook her head, and said 
that her son would show them the flat. There was 
a radiator visible in the narrow hall, and Isabel 
tacitly compromised on steam-heat without an ele- 
vator, as the flat was only one flight up. When the 
son appeared from below with a small kerosene 
hand-lamp, it appeared that the flat was unfur- 
nished, but there was no stopping him till he had 
shown it in all its impossibility. When they got 
safely away from it and into the street March said, 



 

" Well, leave?? I had enough for to-night, Isabel ? 
Shall -we go to the theatre now ? " 

" Not on any account. I want to see the whole 
list of flats that Mr. Fulkcrson thought would be 
the very thing for us." She laughed, but with a 
certain bitterness. 

" You 'll be calling him my Mr. Fulkerson next, 
Isabel." 

" Oh no ! " 

The fourth address was a furnished flat without 
a kitchen, in a house with a general restaurant. 
The fifth was a furnished house. At the sixth a 
pathetic widow and her pretty daughter wanted 
to take a family to board, and would give them a 
private table at a rate which the Marches would 
have thought low in Boston. 

Mrs. March came away tingling with compassion 
for their evident anxiety, and this pity naturally 
soured into a sense of injury. " Well, I must say I 
have completely lost confidence in Mr. Fulkerson's 
judgment. Anything more utterly diff"erent from 
what I told him we wanted I couldn't imagine. If 
he doesn't manage any better about his business 
than he has done about this, it will be a perfect 
failure." 

" "Well, well, let 's hope he 'll be more circumspect 
about that," her husband returned, with ironical 
propitiation, " But I don't think it 's Fulkerson's 
fault altogether. Perhaps it 's the house-agents'. 
They're a very illusory generation. There seems 
to be somethinuj in the human habitation that cor- 



 

rupts the natures of those who deal in it, to buy 
or sell it, to hire or let it. You go to an agent 
and tell him what kind of a house you want. He 
has no such house, and he sends you to look at 
something altogether different, upon the well-ascer- 
tained principle that if you can't get what you want, 
you will take what you can get. You don't sup- 
pose the ' party' that took our house in Boston was 
looking for any such house ? He was looking for a 
totally different kind of house in another part of the 
toAra." 

" I don't believe that ! " his wife broke in. 

" "Well, no matter. But see what a scandalous 
rent you asked for it." 

'' We didn't get much more than half ; and, be- 
sides, the agent told me to ask fourteen hundred." 

" Oh, I 'm not blaming you, Isabel. I 'm only 
analysing the house-agent, and exonerating Fulker- 
son." 

" "Well, I don't believe he told them just what we 
wanted ; and at any rate, I 'm done with agents. 
To-morrow, I 'm going entirely by advertisements." 



VIII. 

Mrs. March took the vertebrate with her to the 
Vienna Coffee-house, where they went to breakfast 
next morning. She made March buy her the 
Herald and the JForld, and she added to its spiny 
convolutions from them. She read the new adver- 
tisements aloud with ardour and with faith to believe 
that the apartments described in them were every 
one truthfully represented, and that any one of them 
was richly responsive to their needs. "Elegant, 
light, largo, single, and outside flats " were offered 
with " all improvements — bath, ice-box, etc." — for 
$25 and 830 a month. The cheapness was amazing. 
The Wagram, the Esmeralda, the Jacinth, advertised 
them for $40 and -SCO, "with steam-heat and eleva- 
tor," rent free till November. Others, attractive 
from their air of conscientious scruple, announced 
" first-class flats ; good order ; reasonable rents." The 
Helena asked the reader if she had seen the " cabinet 
finish, hard-wood floors, and frescoed ceilings " of its 
$50 flats ; the Asteroid affirmed that such apart- 
ments, with " six light rooms and bath, porcelain 
wash-tubs, electric bells, and hall-boy," as it offered 
for $75 were iinapproached by competition. There 




was a sameness in the jargon whicli tended to con- 
fusion. Mrs. March got several flats on her list 
which promised neither steam-heat nor elevators ; 
she forgot herself so far as to include two or three 
as remote from the down-town region of her choice 
as Harlem. But after she had rejected these the 
nondescript vertebrate was still voluminous enough 
to sustain her buoyant hopes. 

The waiter, who remembered them from year to 
year, had put them at a window giving a pretty good 
section of Broadway, and before they set out on 
their search  the y had a moment of reminiscence. 
They recalled the Broadway of five, of ten, of twenty 
years ago, swelling and roaring with a tide of gaily 
painted omnibuses and of picturesque traffic that the 
horse-cars have now banished from it. The grind of 
their wheels and the clash of their harsh bells im- 
perfectly fill the silence that the omnibuses have left, 
and the eye misses the tumultuous perspective of 
former times. 

They went out and stood for a moment before 
Grace Church, and looked down the stately thorough- 
fare, and found it no longer impressive, no longer 
characteristic. It is still Broadway in name, but now 
it is like any other street. You do not now take 
your life in your hand when you attempt to cross it ; 
the Broadway policeman who supported the elbow 
of timorous beauty in the hollow of his cotton-gloved 
palm and guided its little fearful boots over the 
crossing, while he arrested the billowy omnibuses on 
cither side witli r.n imperious glance, is gone, and all 



 

that certain processional, barbaric gaiety of the yVxce 
is gone. 

"Palmyra, Baalbcc, Timour of the Desert," said 
March, voicing their common feeling of the change. 

They turned and went into the beautiful church, 
and found themselves in time for the matin service. 
Rapt far from New York, if not from earth, in the 
dim richness of the painted light, the hallowed music 
took them with solemn ecstasy ; the aerial, aspiring 
Gothic forms seemed to lift them heavenward. They 
came out, reluctant, into the dazzle and bustle of the 
street, with a feeling that they were too good for it, 
which they confessed to each other with whimsical 
consciousness. 

" But no matter how consecrated we feel now," he 
said, " we mustn't forget that we went into the 
church for precisely the same reason that we went 
to the Vienna Cafe for breakfast — to gratify an 
aesthetic sense, to renew the faded pleasure of travel 
for a moment, to get back into the Europe of our 
youth. It was a purely Pagan impulse, Isabel, and 
we 'd better own it." 

" I don't know," she returned. " I think we re- 
duce ourselves to the bare bones too much. I wisli 
we didn't always recognise the facts as we do. Some- 
times I should like to blink them. I should like to 
think I was devouter than I am, and younger and 
prettier." 

' Better not ; you couldn't keep it up. Honesty 
is the best policy even in such things." 

 ' No : I don't like it, Basil. I should rather waib 



 

till the last day for some of my motives to come to 
the top. I know they 're always mixed, but do let 
me give them the benefit of a doubt sometimes." 

"Well, well, have it your own way, my dear. 
But I prefer not to lay up so many disagreeable sur- 
prises for myself at that time." 

She would not consent. " I know I am a good deal 
younger than I was. I feel quite in the mood of 
that morning when we walked down Broadway on 
our wedding journey. Don't you ? " 

" Oh yes. But I know I 'm not younger ; I 'm 
only prettier." 

She laughed for pleasure in his joke, and also for 
unconscious joy in the gay New York weather, in 
which there was no arrihe pensde of the east wind. 
They had crossed Broadway, and were walking over 
to Washington Square, in the region of which they 
now hoped to place themselves. The primo tenore 
statue of Garibaldi had already taken possession of 
the place in the name of Latin progress, and they 
met Italian ftices, French faces, Spanish faces, as they 
strolled over the asphalte walks, under the thinning 
shadows of the autumn-stricken sycamores. They 
met the familiar picturesque raggedness of southern 
Europe with the old kindly illusion that somehow 
it existed for their appreciation, and that it found 
adequate compensation for poverty in this. March 
thought he sufficiently expressed his tacit sympathy 
in sitting down on one of the iron benches with his 
wife, and letting a little Neapolitan put a superfluous 
shine on his boots, whilc their desultory comment 



 

wandcrcJ "with equal esteem to the ohl-fashioncd 
American respectability which keeps the north side 
of the square in vast mansions of red brick, and the 
international shabbiness which has invaded the 
southern border, and broken it up into lodging- 
houses, shops, beer gardens, and studios. 

They noticed the sign of an apartment to let on 
the north side, and as soon as the little boot-black 
could be bought off they went over to look at it. 
The janitor met them at the door and examined 
them. Then he said, as if still in doubt, "It has 
ten rooms, and the rent is twenty-eiglit hundred 
dollars." 

"It wouldn't do, then," March replied, and left 
him to divide the responsibility between the paucity 
of the rooms and the enormity of the rent as he best 
might. But their self-love had received a wound, 
and they questioned each other what it was in their 
appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so 
much. 

"Of course we don't look like Kew- Yorkers," 
sighed Mrs. March, "and we've walked through 
the Square. That might be as if we had walked 
along the Park Street mall in the Common before 
we came out on Beacon. Do you suppose he could 
have seen you getting your boots blacked in that 
way?" 

" It 's useless to ask," said March. " But I never 
can recover from this blow." 

"Oh pshaw! You know you hate such things 
as Ixadly as I do. It was very impertinent of him." 



'' Let us go back, and eraser Vinfdme by paying 
him a j'ear's rent in advance and taking immediate 
possession. Nothing else can soothe my wounded 
feelings. You were not having your boots blacked ; 
why shouldn't he have supposed you were a Xew- 
Yorker, and I a country cousin ? " 

"They always know. Don't you remember Mrs. 
Williams's going to a Fifth wenue milliner in a 
"Worth dress, and the woman's asking her instantly 
what hotel she should send her hat to ? " 

" Yes ; these things drive one to despair. I don't 
wonder the bodies of so many genteel strangers are 
found in the waters around New York. Shall we 
try the south side, my dear ? or liad we better go 
back to our rooms and rest a while ? " 

IMrs. j\Iarch had out the vertebrate, and was con- 
sulting one of its glittering ribs, and glancing up 
from it at a house before which they stood. " Yes, 
it 's the number ; but do they call this being ready 
October ?st?" The little area in front of the base- 
ment was heaped with a mixture of mortar, bricks, 
laths, and shavings from the interior ; the brown- 
stone steps to the front door were similarly 
bestrewn ; the doorway showed the half-open rough 
pine carpenter's hatch of an unfinished house ; the 
sashless windows of eA'ery story showed the actiA'ity 
of workmen within ; the clatter of hammers and 
the hiss of saws came out to them from every open- 
ing. 

" They may call it October 1st," said March, '  be- 
cause it 's too late to contradict them. But they 'd 




better not call it December ?st in my presence ; I 'll 
let them say January ?st, at a pinch." 

" We will go in and look at it anyway," said his 
wife ; and he admired how, when she was once 
within, she began provisionally to settle the family 
in each of the several floors with the female instinct 
for domiciliation which never failed her. She had 
the help of the landlord, who was present to urge 
forward the workmen apparently ; he lent a hopeful 
fancy to the solution of all her questions. To get 
her from under his influence March had to represent 
that the place was damp from undried plastering, 
and that if she stayed she would probably be down 
with that New York pneumonia which visiting Bos- 
tonians are always dying of. Once safely on the 
pavement outside, she realised that the apartment 
was not only unfinished, but unfurnished, and had 
neither steam-heat nor elevator. " But I thought we 
had better look at everything," she explained. 

" Yes, but not take everything. If I hadn't pulled 
you away from there by main force you 'd have not 
only died of New York pneumonia on the spot, but 
you 'd have had us all settled there before we knew 
what we were about." 

" Well, that 's what I can't help, Basil. It 's the 
only way I can realise whether it will do for us. I 
have to dramatise the whole thing." 

She got a deal of pleasure as well as excitement 
oiit of this, and he had to own that the process of 
setting up house-keeping in so many different places 
was not only entertaining, but tended, through as- 



 

sociation with their first beginnings in house-keep- 
ing, to restore the image of their early married 
days, and to make them j'oung again. 

It went on all day, and continued far into the 
night, until it was too late to go to the theatre, too 
late to do anything but tumble into bed and simul- 
taneously fall on sleep. They groaned over their 
reiterated disappointments, but they could not deny 
that the interest was unfailing, and that they got a 
great deal of fun out of it all. Nothing could abate 
Mrs. March's faith in her advertisements. One of 
them sent her to a flat of ten rooms which promised 
to be the solution of all their difficulties ; it proved 
to be over a livery-stable, a liquor store, and a 
milliner's shop, none of the first fashion. Another 
led them far into old Greenwich Village to an 
apartment-house, which she refused to enter be- 
hind a small girl with a loaf of bread under one 
arm and a quart can of milk under the other. 

In their search they were obliged, as March com- 
plained, to the acquisition of useless information in 
a degree unequalled in their experience. They came 
to excel in the sad knowledge of the line at which 
respectability distinguishes itself from shabbiness. 
Flattering advertisements took them to numbers 
of huge apartment-houses chiefly distinguishable 
from tenement-houses by the absence of fire-escapes 
on their fai;ades, till Mrs. March refused to stop at 
any door where there were more than six bell-rat- 
chets and speaking-tubes on either hand. Before 
the middle of the afternoon she decided against 



 

ratchets altogther, and confiucd herself to knobs, 
neatly set in the door-frlm. Her husband was still 
sunk in the superstition that you can live anywhere 
you like in New York, and he would have paused at 
some places where her quicker eye caught the fatal 
sign of " Modes " in the ground-floor windows. She 
found that there was an east and west line beyond 
which they could not go if they wished to keep their 
self-respect, and that within the region to which 
they had restricted themselves there was a choice of 
streets. At first all the New York streets looked to 
them ill-paved, dirty, and repulsive ; the genend 
infamy imparted itself in their casual impression to 
streets in no wise guilty. But they began to notice 
that some streets were quiet and clean, aud, though 
never so quiet and clean as Boston streets, that they 
wore an air of encouraging reform, and suggested a 
future of greater and greater domesticity. "Whole 
blocks of these down-town cross streets seemed to 
have been redeemed from decay, and even in the 
midst of squalor a dwelling here and there had been 
seized, painted a dull-red as to its brick-work, and 
a glossy black as to its wood-work, and with a bright 
brass bell-})ull and door knob and a large brass plate 
for its key-hoiG escutcheon, had been endowed with 
an eff'ect of purity and pride which reuioved its 
shabby neighbourhood far from it. 

Some of these houses were quite small, and 
imaginably within their means ; but, as March said, 
somebody seemed always to be living there himself, 
and the fact that none of them were to rent kept 



 

Mrs. March true to her ideal of a flat. Nothing 
prevented its realisation so much as its difference 
from the New York ideal of a flat, which was in- 
flexibly seven rooms and a bath. One or two rooms 
might be at the front, the rest crooked and cornered 
backward through increasing and then decreasing 
darkness till they reached a light bedroom or kitchen 
at the rear. It might be the one or the other, but 
it was always the seventh room with the bath ; or 
if, as sometimes happened, it was the eighth, it was 
so after having counted the bath as one. In this 
case the janitor said you always counted the bath as 
one. If the flats were advertised as having "all 
light rooms," lie explained that any room with a 
window giving into the open air of a court or shaft 
was counted a light room. 

The Marches tried to make out why it was that 
these flats were so much more repulsive than the 
apartments which every one lived in abroad ; Ijut 
they could only do so upon the supposition that 
in their European days they were too young, too 
happy, too full of the future, to notice whether 
rooms were inside or outside, light or dark, big or 
little, high or low. "Now we're imprisoned in 
the present," he said, "and we have to make the 
worst of it." 

In their despair he had an inspiration, which she 
declared worthy of him : ib was to take two small 
flats, of four or five rooms and a bath, and live in 
both. They tried this in a great many places ; but 
they never could get two flats of the kind on the 


same floor where there was steam-heat and an 
elevator. At one place they almost did it. They 
had resigned themselves to the hnmility of the 
neighbourhood, to the prevalence of modistes and 
livery-stablemen (they seem to consort much in New 
York), to the garbage in the gutters and the litter 
of paper in the streets, to the faltering slats in the 
surrounding -window-shutters and the crumbled 
brown-stone steps and sills, when it turned out that 
one of the apartments had been taken between two 
visits they made. Then the only combination left 
open to them was of a ground-floor flat to the right 
and a third-floor flat to the left. 

Still they kept this inspiration in reserve for use 
at the first opportunity. In the meaniime there 
were several flats which they thought they could 
almost make do : notably one where they could get 
an extra servant's room in the basement four flights
