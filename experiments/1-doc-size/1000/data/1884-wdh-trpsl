she said, " painted on a reef that we saw as we came 
down." 

Corey smiled. " Well, I suppose, if it was in a 
good state of preservation, that is proof positive of 
the efficacy of the paint on the hulls of vessels." 

" It 's very distasteful to me, Tom," said his 
mother ; and if there was something else in her 
mind, she did not speak more plainly of it than to 
add: "It's not only the kind of business, but the 
kind of people you would be mixed up with." 

" I thought you didn't find them so very bad," 
suggested Corey. 

" I hadn't seen them in Nankeen Square then." 

" You can see them on the water side of Beacon 
Street when you go back." 

Then he told of his encounter with the Lapham 
family in their new house. At the end his mother 
merely said, " It is getting very common down 
there," and she did not try to oppose anything 
further to his scheme. 

The young man went to see Colonel Lapham 
shortly after his return to Boston. He paid his 
visit at Lapham's office, and if he had studied 
simplicity in his summer dress he could not have 
presented himself in a figure more to the mind of a 
practical man. His hands and neck still kept the 
brown of the Texan suns and winds, and he looked 
as business-like as Lapham himself. 

He spoke up promptly and briskly in the outer 
office, and caused the pretty girl to look away from 



 

her copying at him. "Is Mr. Lapham in?" he 
asked ; and after that moment for reflection which 
an array of book-keepers so addressed likes to give 
the inquirer, a head was lifted from a ledger and 
nodded toward the inner office. 

Lapham had recognised the voice, and he was 
standing, in considerable perplexity, to receive Corey, 
when the young man opened his painted glass door. 
It was a hot afternoon, and Lapham was in his shirt 
sleeves. Scarcely a trace of the boastful hospitality 
with which he had welcomed Corey to his house a 
few days before lingered in his present address. He 
looked at the young man's face, as if he expected 
him to despatch whatever unimaginable affair he 
had come upon. 

" Won't you sit down ? How are you ? You 'll 
excuse me," he added, in brief allusion to the shirt 
sleeves. " I 'm about roasted." 

Corey laughed, " I wish you 'd let me take off 
my coat." 

" Why, take it off !" cried the Colonel, with instant 
pleasure. There is something in human nature 
which causes the man in his shirtrsleeves to wish all 
other men to appear in the same deshabille. 

" I will, if you ask me after I 've talked with you 
two minutes," said the young fellow, companion- 
ably pulling up the chair offered him toward the 
desk where Lapham had again seated himself. 
" But perhaps you haven't got two minutes to give 
me?" 

" Oh yes, I have," said the Colonel " I was 



 

just going to knock off. I can give you twenty, and 
then I shall have fifteen minutes to catch the boat." 

" All right," said Corey. " I want you to take 
me into the mineral paint business." 

The Colonel sat dumb. He twisted his thick 
neck, and looked round at the door to see if it was 
shut. He would not have liked to have any of 
those fellows outside hear him, but there is no 
saying what sum of money he would not have given 
if his wife had been there to hear what Corey had 
just said. 

" I suppose," continued the young man, " I could 
have got several people whose names you know to 
back my industry and sobriety, and say a word for 
my business capacity. But I thought I wouldn't 
trouble anybody for certificates till I found whether 
there was a chance, or the ghost of one, of your 
wanting me. So I came straight to you." 

Lapham gathered himself together as well as he 
could. He had not yet forgiven Corey for Mrs. Lap- 
ham's insinuation that he would feel himself too 
good for the mineral paint business ; and though he 
was dispersed by that astounding shot at first, he was 
not going to let any one even hypothetically despise 
his paint with impunity. " How do you think I am 
going to take you on ? " They took on hands at the 
works ; and Lapham put it as if Corey were a hand 
coming to him for employment. Whether he satis 
fied himself by this or not, he reddened a little after 
he had said it. 

Corey answered, ignorant of the offence : " I 




haven't a very clear idea, I'm afraid; but I've 
been looking a little into the matter from the out 
side " 

" I hope you hain't been paying any attention to 
that fellow's stuff in the Events?" Lapham inter 
rupted. Since Bartley's interview had appeared, 
Lapham had regarded it with very mixed feelings. 
At first it gave him a glow of secret pleasure, 
blended with doubt as to how his wife would like 
the use Bartley had made of her in it. But she had 
not seemed to notice it much, and Lapham had ex 
perienced the gratitude of the man who escapes. 
Then his girls had begun to make fun of it; and 
though he did not mind Penelope's jokes much, 
he did not like to see that Irene's gentility was 
wounded. Business friends met him with the kind 
of knowing smile about it that implied their sense 
of the fraudulent character of its praise the smile 
of men who had been there and who knew how it 
was themselves. Lapham had his misgivings as to 
how his clerks and underlings looked at it ; he 
treated them with stately severity for a while after 
it came out, and he ended by feeling rather sore 
about it. He took it for granted that everybody 
had read it. 

" I don't know what you mean," replied Corey, 
" I don't see the Events regularly." 

" Oh, it was nothing. They sent a fellow down 
here to interview me, and he got everything about 
as twisted as he could." 

" I believe they always do," said Corey. " I 



 

hadn't seen it Perhaps it came out before I got 
home." 

" Perhaps it did." 

" My notion of making myself useful to you was 
based on a hint I got from one of your own circu 
lars." 

Lapham was proud of those circulars ; he thought 
they read very well. " What was that ? " 

" I could put a little capital into the business," 
said Corey, with the tentative accent of a man who 
chances a thing. " I Ve got a little money, but I 
didn't imagine you cared for anything of that 
kind." 

" No, sir, I don't," returned the Colonel bluntly. 
" I 've had one partner, and one 's enough." 

" Yes," assented the young man, who doubtless 
had his own ideas as to eventualities or perhaps 
rather had the vague hopes of youth. " I didn't 
come to propose a partnership. But I see that you 
are introducing your paint into the foreign markets, 
and there I really thought I might be of use to you, 
and to myself too." 

" How ? " asked the Colonel scantly. 

" Well, I know two or three languages pretty 
well. I know French, and I know German, and 
I Ve got a pretty fair sprinkling of Spanish." 

" You mean that you can talk them ? " asked the 
Colonel, with the mingled awe and slight that such 
a man feels for such accomplishments. 

" Yes ; and I can write an intelligible letter in 
either of them." 



 

Lapham rubbed his nose. "It's easy enough to 
get all the letters we want translated." 

" Well," pursued Corey, not showing his dis 
couragement if he felt any, " I know the countries 
where you want to introduce this paint of yours. 
I Ve been there. I Ve been in Germany and France, 
and I 've been in South America and Mexico ; I 've 
been in Italy, of course. I believe I could go to any 
of those countries and place it to advantage." 

Lapham had listened with a trace of persuasion in 
his face, but now he shook his head. 

" It 's placing itself as fast as there 's any call for 
it. It wouldn't pay us to send anybody out to look 
after it. Your salary and expenses would eat up 
about all we should make on it." 

" Yes," returned the young man intrepidly, " if 
you had to pay me any salary and expenses." 

" You don't propose to work for nothing ?" 

" I propose to work for a commission." The 
Colonel was beginning to shake his head again, but 
Corey hurried on. " I haven't come to you without 
making some inquiries about the paint, and I know 
how it stands with those who know best. I believe 
in it." 

Lapham lifted his head and looked at the young 
man, deeply moved. 

"It's the best paint in God's universe," he said, 
with the solemnity of prayer. 

" It 's the best in the market," said Corey ; and he 
repeated, "I believe in it." 

" You believe in it," began the Colonel, and then 



 

he stopped. If there had really been any purchasing 
power in money, a year's income would have bought 
Mrs. Lapham's instant presence. He warmed and 
softened to the young man in every way, not only 
because he must do so to any one who believed in 
his paint, but because he had done this innocent 
person the wrong of listening to a defamation of his 
instinct and good sense, and had been willing to see 
him suffer for a purely supposititious offence. 

Corey rose. 

" You mustn't let me outstay my twenty minutes," 
he said, taking out his watch. " I don't expect you 
to give a decided answer on the spot. All that I ask 
is that you'll consider my proposition." 

"Don't hurry," said Lapham. " Sit still ! I want 
to tell you about this paint," he added, in a voice 
husky with the feeling that his hearer could not 
divine. " I want to tell you all about it." 

" I could walk with you to the boat," suggested 
the young man. 

" Never mind the boat ! I can take the next 
one. Look here !" The Colonel pulled open a 
drawer, as Corey sat down again, and took out a 
photograph of the locality of the mine. " Here 's 
where we get it. This photograph don't half do the 
place justice," he said, as if the imperfect art had 
slighted the features of a beloved face. " It 's one of 
the sightliest places in the country, and here 's the 
very spot " he covered it with his huge forefinger 
" where my father found that paint, more than 
forty years ago. Yes, sir !" 



 

He went on, and told the story in unsparing 
detail, while his chance for the boat passed unheeded, 
and the clerks in the outer office hung up their linen 
office coats and put on their seersucker or flannel 
street coats. The young lady went too, and nobody 
was left but the porter, who made from time to time 
a noisy demonstration of fastening a distant blind, 
or putting something in place. At last the Colonel 
roused himself from the autobiographical delight of 
the history of his paint. " Well, sir, that 's the 
story." 

" It 's an interesting story," said Corey, with a 
long breath, as they rose together, and Lapham put 
on his coat. 

" That 's what it is," said the Colonel. " Well !" 
he added, " I don't see but what we 've got to have 
another talk about this thing. It 's a surprise to me, 
and I don't see exactly how you 're going to make it 

pay." 

" I 'm willing to take the chances," answered Corey. 
" As I said, I believe in it. I should try South 
America first. I should try Chili." 

" Look here !" said Lapham, with his watch in his 
hand. " I like to get things over. We Ve just got 
time for the six o'clock boat. Why don't you come 
down with me to Nantasket ? I can give you a bed 
as well as not. And then we can finish up." 

The impatience of youth in Corey responded to 
the impatience of temperament in his elder. 

"Why, I don't see why I shouldn't," he allowed 
himself to say. " I confess I should like to have it 



 

finished up myself, if it could be finished up in the 
right way." 

"Well, we'll see. Dennis!" Lapham called to 
the remote porter, and the man came. " Want to 
send any word home ? " he asked Corey. 

" No ; my father and I go and come as we like, 
without keeping account of each other. If I don't 
come home, he knows that I 'm not there. That 's 
all" 

" Well, that 's convenient. You'll find you can't 
do that when you 're married. Never mind, Dennis," 
said the Colonel. 

He had time to buy two newspapers on the wharf 
before he jumped on board the steam-boat with 
Corey. " Just made it," he said ; " and that 's what I 
like to do. I can't stand it to be aboard much more 
than a minute before she shoves out." He gave one 
of the newspapers to Corey as he spoke, and set him 
the example of catching up a camp-stool on their 
way to that point on the boat which his experience 
had taught him was the best. He opened his paper 
at once and began to run over its news, while the 
young man watched the spectacular recession of 
the city, and was vaguely conscious of the people 
about him, and of the gay life of the water round 
the boat. The air freshened ; the craft thinned 
in number ; they met larger sail, lagging slowly 
inward in the afternoon light ; the islands of the 
bay waxed and waned as the steamer approached 
and left them behind. 

"I hate to see them stirring up those Southern 



 

fellows again," said the Colonel, speaking into the 
paper on his lap. " Seems to me it 's time to let 
those old issues go." 

" Yes," said the young man. " What are they 
doing now ? " 

" Oh, stirring up the Confederate brigadiers in 
Congress. I don't like it. Seems to me, if our 
party hain't got any other stock-in-trade, we better 
shut up shop altogether." Lapham went on, as he 
scanned his newspaper, to give his ideas of public 
questions, in a fragmentary way, while Corey listened 
patiently, and waited for him to come back to busi 
ness. He folded up his paper at last, and stuffed it 
into his coat pocket. " There 's one thing I always 
make it a rule to do," he said, " and that is to give 
my mind a complete rest from* business while I 'm 
going down on the boat. I like to get the fresh air 
all through me, soul and body. I believe a man can 
give his mind a rest, just the same as he can give 
his legs a rest, or his back. All he 's got to do is to 
use his will-power. Why, I suppose, if I hadn't 
adopted some such rule, with the strain I 've had on 
me for the last ten years, I should 'a' been a dead 
man long ago. That's the reason I like a horse. 
You 've got to give your mind to the horse ; you can't 
help it, unless you want to break your neck ; but a 
boat 's different, and there you got to use your will 
power. You got to take your mind right up and 
put it where you want it. I make it a rule to read 

the paper on the boat Hold on ! " he interrupted 

himself to prevent Corey from paying his fare to 



 

the man who had come round for it. " I 've got 
tickets. And when I get through the paper, I try 
to get somebody to talk to, or I watch the people. 
It 's an astonishing thing to me where they all come 
from. I Ve been riding up and down on these boats 
for six or seven years, and I don't know but very 
few of the faces I see on board. Seems to be a 
perfectly fresh lot every time. Well, of course ! 
Town 's full of strangers in the summer season, any 
way, and folks keep coming down from the country. 
They think it's a great thing to get down to the 
beach, and they 've all heard of the electric light on 
the water, and they want to see it. But you take 
faces now ! The astonishing thing to me is not 
what a face tells, but what it don't tell. When you 
think of what a man is, or a woman is, and what 
most of 'em have been through before they get to be 
thirty, it seems as if their experience would burn right 
through. But it don't. I like to watch the couples, 
and try to make out which are engaged, or going to 
be, and which are married, or better be. But half 
the time I can't make any sort of guess. Of course, 
where they 're young and kittenish, you can tell ; 
but where they 're anyways on, you can't. Heigh ? " 

" Yes, I think you 're right," said Corey, not per 
fectly reconciled to philosophy in the place of busi 
ness, but accepting it as he must. 

" Well," said the Colonel, " I don't suppose it was 
meant we should know what was in each other's 
minds. It would take a man out of his own hands. 
As long as he's in his own hands, there's some 



SILAS LAPHAM. Ill 

hopes of his doing something with himself ; but if 
a fellow has been found out- even if he hasn't been 
found out to be so very bad it 's pretty much all 
up with him. No, sir. I don't want to know 
people through and through." 

The greater part of the crowd on board and, of 
course, the boat was crowded looked as if they 
might not only be easily but safely known. There 
was little style and no distinction among them ; 
they were people who were going down to the beach 
for the fun or the relief of it, and were able to afford 
it. In face they were commonplace, with nothing 
but the American poetry of vivid purpose to light 
them up, where they did not wholly lack fire. But 
they were nearly all shrewd and friendly-looking, 
with an apparent readiness for the humorous inti 
macy native to us all. The women were dandified 
in dress, according to their means and taste, and 
the men differed from each other in degrees of 
indifference to it. To a straw-hatted population, 
such as ours is in summer, no sort of personal 
dignity is possible. We have not even the power 
over observers which comes from the fantasticality 
of an Englishman when he discards the conventional 
dress. In our straw hats and our serge or flannel 
sacks we are no more imposing than a crowd of 
boys. 

" Some day," said Lapham, rising as the boat 
drew near the wharf of the final landing, " there 's 
going to be an awful accident on these boats. J ust 
look at that jam.' 



 

He meant the people thickly packed on the pier, 
and under strong restraint of locks and gates, to 
prevent them from rushing on board the boat and 
possessing her for the return trip before she had 
landed her Xantasket passengers. 

" Overload 'em every time," he continued, with 
a sort of dry, impersonal concern at the impending 
calamity, as if it could not possibly include him. 
" They take about twice as many as they ought to 
carry, and about ten times as many as they could 
save if anything happened. Yes, sir, it 's bound to 
come. Hello ! There 's my girl ! " He took out 
his folded newspaper and waved it toward a group 
of phaetons and barouches drawn up on the pier 
a little apart from the pack of people, and a lady 
in one of them answered with a nourish of her 
parasol. 

When he had made his way with his guest through 
the crowd, she began to speak to her father before 
she noticed Corey. "Well, Colonel, you've im 
proved your last chance. We've been coming to 
every boat since four o'clock, or Jerry has, and 
I told mother that I would come myself once, and 
see if I couldn't fetch you ; and if I failed, you 
could walk next time. You 're getting perfectly 
spoiled." 

The Colonel enjoyed letting her scold him to the 
end before he said, with a twinkle of pride in his 
guest and satisfaction in her probably being able 
to hold her own against any discomfiture, " I 've 
brought Mr. Corey down for the night with me, 



 

and I was showing him things all the way, and it 
took time." 

The young fellow was at the side of the open 
beach-wagon, making a quick bow, and Penelope 
Lapham was cozily drawling, "Oh, how do you do, 
Mr. Corey?" before the Colonel had finished his 
explanation. 

"Get right in there, alongside of Miss Lapham, 
Mr. Corey," he said, pulling himself up into the 
place beside the driver. " No, no," he had added 
quickly, at some signs of polite protest in the young 
man, "I don't give up the best place to anybody. 
Jerry, suppose you let me have hold of the leathers 
a minute." 

This was his way of taking the reins from the 
driver ; and in half the time he specified, he had 
skilfully turned the vehicle on the pier, among the 
crooked lines and groups of foot-passengers, and 
was spinning up the road toward the stretch of 
verandaed hotels and restaurants in the sand along 
the shore. " Pretty gay down here," he said, indi 
cating all this with a turn of his whip, as he left it 
behind him. " But I Ve got about sick of hotels ; 
and this summer I made up my mind that I 'd take 
a cottage. Well, Pen, how are the folks V He 
looked half-way round for her answer, and with 
the eye thus brought to bear upon her he was 
able to give her a wink of supreme content. The 
Colonel, with no sort of ulterior design, and nothing 
but his triumph over Mrs. Lapham definitely in his 
mind, was feeling, as he would have said, about right. 
H 



 

The girl smiled a daughter's amusement at her 
father's boyishness. "I don't think there's much 
change since morning. Did Irene have a headache 
when you left ? " 

" No," said the Colonel. 

" Well, then, there 's that to report. " 

" Pshaw ! " said the Colonel with vexation in his 
tone. 

" I 'm sorry Miss Irene isn't well," said Corey 
politely. 

" I think she must have got it from walking too 
long on the beach. The air is so cool here that you 
forget how hot the sun is." 

" Yes, that 's true," assented Corey. 

"A good night's rest will make it all right," sug 
gested the Colonel, without looking round. "But 
you girls have got to look out." 

"If you're fond of walking," said Corey, "I 
suppose you find the beach a temptation." 

"Oh, it isn't so much that," returned the girl. 
"You keep walking on and on because it's so 
smooth and straight before you. We've been 
here so often that we know it all by heart just 
how it looks at high tide, and how it looks at low 
tide, and how it looks after a storm. We're as 
well acquainted with the crabs and stranded jelly 
fish as we are with the children digging in the sand 
and the people sitting under umbrellas. I think 
they 're always the same, all of them." 

The Colonel left the talk to the young people. 
When he spoke next it was to say, "Well, here 



 

we are ! " and he turned from the highway and 
drove up in front of a brown cottage with a ver 
milion roof, and a group of geraniums clutching 
the rock that cropped up in the loop formed by 
the road. It was treeless and bare all round, and 
the ocean, unnecessarily vast, weltered away a little 
more than a stone's-cast from the cottage. A hos 
pitable smell of supper filled the air, and Mrs. 
Lapham was on the veranda, with that demand 
in her eyes for her belated husband's excuses, which 
she was obliged to check on her tongue at sight of 
Corey. 



VII. 

THE exultant Colonel swung himself lightly down 
from his seat. " I 've brought Mr. Corey with me," 
he nonchalantly explained. 

Mrs. Lapham made their guest welcome, and the 
Colonel showed him to his room, briefly assuring him 
self that there was nothing wanting there. Then 
he went to wash his own hands, carelessly ignoring 
the eagerness with which his wife pursued him to 
their chamber. 

" What gave Irene a headache ? " he asked, 
making himself a fine lather for his hairy paws. 

"Never you mind Irene," promptly retorted his 
wife. "How came he to comej Did you press 
him ? If you did, I 'll never forgive you, Silas ! " 

The Colonel laughed, and his wife shook him by 
the shoulder to make him laugh lower. " 'Sh ! " 
she whispered. "Do you want him to hear every 
thing ? Did you urge him ? " 

The Colonel laughed the more. He was going to 
get all the good out of this. " No, I didn't urge him. 
Seemed to want to come." 

" I don't believe it. Where did you meet him ? " 

"At the office." 


"What office ?" 

" Mine." 

" Nonsense ! What was he doing there ? " 

" Oh, nothing much." 

" What did he come for V 

" Come for ? Oh ! he said he wanted to go into 
the mineral paint business." 

Mrs. Lapham dropped into a chair, and watched 
his bulk shaken with smothered laughter. " Silas 
Lapham," she gasped, " if you try to get off any 
more of those things on me " 

The Colonel applied himself to the towel. " Had 
a notion he could work it in South America. I don't 
know what he 's up to." 

"Never mind!" cried his wife. "I'll get even 
with you yet." 

" So I told him he had better come down and 
talk it over," continued the Colonel, in well-affected 
simplicity. " I knew he wouldn't touch it with a 
ten-foot pole." 

" Go on !" threatened Mrs. Lapham. 

" Right thing to do, wa'n't it?" 

A tap was heard at the door, and Mrs. Lapham 
answered it. A maid announced supper. " Very 
well," she said, " come to tea now. But I 'll make 
you pay for this, Silas." 

Penelope had gone to her sister's room as soon as 
she entered the house. 

" Is your head any better, 'Rene ?" she asked. 

" Yes, a little," came a voice from the pillows. 
" But I shall not come to tea. I don't want any- 



 

thing, If I keep still, I shall be all right by morn- 
ing." 

" Well, I 'm sorry," said the elder sister. " He 's 
come down with father." 

"He hasn't! Who?" cried Irene, starting up in 
simultaneous denial and demand. 

" Oh, well, if you say he hasn't, what 's the use of 
my telling you who '" 

"Oh, how can you treat me so!" moaned the 
sufferer. " What do you mean, Pen ?" 

" I guess I 'd better not tell you," said Penelope, 
watching her like a cat playing with a mouse. " If 
you 're not coming to tea, it would just excite you 
for nothing." 

The mouse moaned and writhed upon the bed. 

" Oh, I wouldn't treat you so ! " 

The cat seated herself across the room, and asked 
quietly 

" Well, what could you do if it was Mr. Corey ? 
You couldn't come to tea, you say. But he 'll excuse 
you. I've told him you had a headache. Why, of 
course you can't come ! It would be too barefaced. 
But you needn't be troubled, Irene ; I 'll do my best 
to make the time pass pleasantly for him." Here 
the cat gave a low titter, and the mouse girded itself 
up with a momentary courage and self-respect. 

" I should think you would be ashamed to come 
here and tease me so. " 

" I don't see why you shouldn't believe me," 
argued Penelope. " Why shouldn't he come down 
with father, if father asked him ? and he 'd be sure 




to if he thought of it. I don't see any p'ints about 
that frog that 's any better than any other frog." 

The sense of her sister's helplessness was too much 
for the tease ; she broke down in a fit of smothered 
laughter, which convinced her victim that it was 
nothing but an ill-timed joke. 

" Well, Pen, I wouldn't use you so," she whim 
pered. 

Penelope threw herself on the bed beside her. 

" Oh, poor Irene ! He is here. It 's a solemn, 
fact." And she caressed and soothed her sister, 
while she choked with laughter. " You must get 
up and come out. I don't know what brought him 
here, but here he is." 

" It 's too late now," said Irene desolately. Then 
she added, with a wilder despair : " What a fool I 
was to take that walk !" 

" Well," coaxed her sister, " come out and get some 
tea. The tea will do you good." 

" No, no ; I can't come. But send me a cup 
here." 

" Yes, and then perhaps you can see him later in 
the evening." 

" I shall not see him at all." 

An hour after Penelope came back to her sister's 
room and found her before her glass. " You might 
as well have kept still, and been well by morning, 
'Rene," she said. " As soon as we were done father 
said, ' Well, Mr. Corey and I have got to talk over 
a little matter of business, and we'll excuse you, 
ladies.' He looked at mother in a way that I guess 





was pretty hard to bear. 'Eene, you ought to have 
heard the Colonel swelling at supper. It would 
have made you feel that all he said the other day 
was nothing." 

Mrs. Lapham suddenly opened the door. 

" Now, see here, Pen," she said, as she closed it 
behind her, " I Ve had just as much as I can stand 
from your father, and if you don't tell me this instant 
what it all means ' 

She left the consequences to imagination, and 
Penelope replied with her mock soberness 

" Well, the Colonel does seem to be on his high 
horse, ma'am. But you mustn't ask me what his 
business with Mr. Corey is, for I don't know. All 
that I know is that I met them at the landing, and 
that they conversed all the way down on literary 
topics." 

"Nonsense ! What do you think it is ?" 

" Well, if you want my candid opinion, I think 
this talk about business is nothing but a blind. It 
seems a pity Irene shouldn't have been up to receive 
him," she added. 

Irene cast a mute look of imploring at her mother, 
who was too much preoccupied to afford her the 
protection it asked. 

" Your father said he wanted to go into the busi 
ness with him." 

Irene's look changed to a stare of astonishment 
and mystification, but Penelope preserved her im 
perturbability. 

" Well, it 's a lucrative business, I believe." 



 

" Well, I don't believe a word of it ! " cried Mrs. 
Lapham. " And so I told your father." 

" Did it seem to convince him ? " inquired Pene 
lope. 

Her mother did not reply. " I know one thing,' 
she said. " He 's got to tell me every word, or 
there 'll be no sleep for him this night." 

" Well, ma'am," said Penelope, breaking down in 
one of her queer laughs, " I shouldn't be a bit sur 
prised if you were right." 

" Go on and dress, Irene," ordered her mother, 
" and then you and Pen come out into the parlour. 
They can have just two hours for business, and 
then we must all be there to receive him. You 
haven't got headache enough to hurt you." 

" Oh, it 's all gone now," said the girL 

At the end of the limit she had given the Colonel, 
Mrs. Lapham looked into the dining-room, which 
she found blue with his smoke. 

" I think you gentlemen will find the parlour 
pleasanter now, and we can give it up to you." 

" Oh no, you needn't," said her husband. 
" We 've got about through." Corey was already 
standing, and Lapham rose too. " I guess we can 
join the ladies now. We can leave that little point 
till to-morrow." 

Both of the young ladies were in the parlour 
when Corey entered with their father, and both 
were frankly indifferent to the few books and the 
many newspapers scattered about on the table 
where the large lamp was placed. But after Corey 



 

had greeted Irene he glanced at the novel under his 
eye, and said, in the dearth that sometimes befalls 
people at such times : "I see you 're reading 
Middlemarch. Do you like George Eliot ? " 

" Who ? " asked the girl. 

Penelope interposed. " I don't believe Irene 's 
read it yet. I 've just got it out of the library ; I 
heard so much talk about it. I wish she would let 
you find out a little about the people for yourself," 
she added.' But here her father struck in 

" I can't get the time for books. It 's as much as 
I can do to keep up with the newspapers ; and 
when night comes, I 'm tired, and I 'd rather go out 
to the theatre, or a lecture, if they 've got a good 
stereopticon to give you views of the places. But 
I guess we all like a play better than 'most anything 
else. I want something that 'll make me laugh. I 
don't believe in tragedy. I think there 's enough ot 
that in real life without putting it on the stage. 
Seen ' Joshua Whitcomb ' ? " 

The whole family joined in the discussion, and it 
appeared that they all had their opinions of the 
plays and actors. Mrs. Lapham brought the talk 
back to literature. " I guess Penelope does most of 
our reading." 

" Now, mother, you 're not going to put it all on 
me ! " said the girl, in comic protest. 

Her mother laughed, and then added, with a 
sigh : " I used to like to get hold of a good book 
when I was a girl ; but we weren't allowed to read 
many novels in those days. My mother called 



 

them all lies. And I guess she wasn't so very far 
wrong about some of them." 

" They 're certainly fictions," said Corey, smiling. 

" Well, we do buy a good many books, first and 
last," said the Colonel, who probably had in mind 
the costly volumes which they presented to one 
another on birthdays and holidays. " But I get 
about all the reading I want in the newspapers. 
And when the girls want a novel, I tell 'em to get 
it out of the library. That 's what the library 's for. 
Phew ! " he panted, blowing away the whole unpro 
fitable subject. " How close you women-folks like 
to keep a room ! You go down to the sea-side or 
up to the mountains for a change of air, and then 
you cork yourselves into a room so tight you don't 
have any air at all. Here ! You girls get on your 
bonnets, and go and show Mr. Corey the view of the 
hotels from the rocks." 

Corey said that he should be delighted. The 
girls exchanged looks with each other, and then 
with their mother. Irene curved her pretty chin in 
comment upon her " father's incorrigibility, and 
Penelope made a droll mouth, but the Colonel 
remained serenely content with his finesse. " I got 
'em out of the way," he said, as soon as they were 
gone, and before his wife had time to fall upon him, 
" because I 've got through my talk with him, and 
now I want to talk with you. It 's just as I said, 
Persis ; he wants to go into the business with me." 

"It's lucky for you," said his wife, meaning that 
now he would not be made to suffer for attempting 



 

to hoax her. But she was too intensely interested 
to pursue that matter further. " What in the world 
do you suppose he means by it ? " 

" Well, I should judge by his talk that he had 
been trying a good many different things since he 
left college, and he hain't found just the thing he 
likes or the thing that likes him. It ain't so easy. 
And now he 's got an idea that he can take hold of 
the paint and push it in other countries Rush it in 
Mexico and push it in South America. He 's a 
splendid Spanish scholar," this was Lapham's
