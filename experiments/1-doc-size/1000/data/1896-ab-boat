porary allusions illustrate his royal and 
prodigal way of sweeping up the dust 
from the path of every-day life and using 
it for ornament of his pageants. 

The "parcel-gilt goblet at the Boar's 
Head," — a careless mention, fit only to 
cause a passing smile on such lips as 
had merrily touched its brim, but to us, 
cold under the long shadows of too late 
a day, pregnant with wondrous meaning. 
For to have looked upon what Shake- 
speare saw, though it be but the infi- 
nitely removed descendants of the daisies 
that bloomed at Stratford three centu- 
ries ago, to have held what his hand 
once touched, is to have found one vivi- 
fying crumb left from that high feast 
when every man 

" put his whole wit in a jest, 
And resolved to live a fool the rest 
Of his dull life." 

 

The first significant point of our 
Warwickshire pilgrimage was Coventry 
(I refrain with some difficulty from 
the qualif)dng "three-spired," since the 
guide-books have made it all their own), 
and here an ancient dame, little guess- 
ing that graver matters occupied my 
thoughts, insisted on stopping us in the 
street, and pointing out the head of 
Peeping Tom. " Go to, thou 'rt naught ! " 
I could have said, for my mind was busy 
painting itself a picture of Falstaff's 
scarecrow army, as it marched hereby 
to the battlefield where the immortd 
Jack vicariously slew Hotspur, after 
fighting that "long hour by Shrewsbury 
clock." Once begin to imagine that 
tattered and straggling host, and you 
will perforce dismiss the Lady Godiva, 
though with a reverent mind, and con- 
sider not architecture, albeit three or 
thirty spires insistently call : — an army 
of such as "were never soldiers, but 
discarded, unjust serving-men, younger 
 

sons to younger brothers, revolted tap- 
sters, and ostlers tradefallen; the can- 
kers of a calm world, and a long peace ; 
... a hundred and fifty tattered prodi- 
gals, lately come from swine-keeping, 
from eating draff and husks." More- 
over, an army which needed not the 
outfit of shirts, since, like Autolycus of 
blessed memory, it could "find linen 
enough on every hedge." But not 
always may you stay to hobnob with 
fat Jack; a wandering life has many 
secondary joys in fee, and presently, in 
sober and practical fashion, we engaged 
a carriage to take us to the salient 
spots of George Eliot's Warwickshire 
sojourn. Now for my own part, I do 
so heartily agree with her relatives and 
friends in their distaste for the prying 
tourist who would fain make his way 
into their gardens and bedrooms — nay, 
into their very linen-chests, in search 
of the table-cloths woven by Mrs. Tulli- 
ver herself "and bleached so beautiful," 
and marked "so as nobody ever saw 
such marking," — that it would take a 
strong temptation to draw me into such 
forbidden ways. (The temptation came, 
in good time, let me whisper, and I 
 

succumbed to it, and was glad!) But 
it is an ever-growing delight to me to 
look on the same tract of earth and 
the very outline of tree and roof which 
once fed the gaze of heroes. Think of 
the country about Stratford and its 
influence on the mind of Master Will 
Shakespeare, reputed poacher, and lover 
of Anne Hathaway, — the fruitful earth 
and ever responsive leafage, the hedges, 
lavish of bloom, the still-flowing streams, 
great sky-spaces and far horizon; must 
they not so have nourished and calmed 
that great spirit that it could thereafter 
express itself from a state of serene 
healthfulness only to be attained in fit- 
ful moods by one suffocated in mining 
damps and glooms, or depressed by the 
gray wastes of Lincolnshire? And so, 
in tracing the steps of this woman- 
genius, it was enough to look at the 
outside of the Coventry School where 
she was a shy and earnest student, or 
at Rosehill, happy scene of her friend- 
ship with the Brays, without in the 
least desiring entrance, and then to 
drive on to Griff House, where almost 
a quarter -century of her youth was 
passed. 

 

During the progress of the road from 
Coventry to Nuneaton, Warwickshire 
displays a thoughtful and sober face. 
The earth is harder and more unyield- 
ing than at flowery Stratford No 
longer does it smile unreservedly. Coal 
dust has here and there begrimed it; 
and at intervals a bare and ugly chimney 
points upward a sooty finger in derisive 
challenge to the "whip of the skies." 
At a glance, one reads here the earth- 
doom and history, — the tale of unre- 
mitting toil. In sweet farming regions 
man may be baptized in his own sweat 
and made drunk by his own tears, but 
the gracious and deceitful earth only 
smiles the more, and makes his home an 
outer paradise, so that the thoughtless 
onlooker is glad for him, and fancies 
the poetic content of days spent in his 
picturesque (and mildewed) thatched cot- 
tage. But here the harder phases of 
living make themselves rudely apparent, 
and who can doubt that George Eliot 
read from them her first gospel of the 
trouble of life ? 

Now, John, our driver that day, a 
most serious man who talked as if he 
might have been an intimate acquaint- 
 

ance of the Great Lexicographer, was 
impressed with a wholesome fear of Mr. 
Isaac Evans, George Eliot's brother. 
According to him, this gentleman had 
suffered much from the settling of 
tourists upon his roof-tree, very like 
the plagues of ancient Egypt ; and we 
could imagine that he had threatened 
our conscientious John with dire ven- 
geance, should he ever bring such har- 
pies that way again. "All hail to thee 
for a sensible man, O brother of the 
great ! " we ejaculated mentally. " Not 
for worlds would we invade thy peace ! " 

"You can walk inside the grounds," 
said John, drawing up before Griff 
House. "He won't mind that. But 
please, miss, don't go into the house ! " 

Go into the house, like a monster 
made out of Paul Pry and Peeping Tom ! 
Though American, we were not of that 
mould, and it was only after repeated 
urgings from the box that we alighted, 
and like cats in a cream-rich pantry, 
took a few cautious steps into the trim 
door-yard in front of the comfortable 
brick house. And there temptation laid 
for our feet its first cobweb snare. A 
woman, a very decent serving-woman, 
 

came walking down the path, and to 
her we weakly apologized for our pres- 
ence, adding that we were from over-sea, 
and that we could not resist looking upon 
the spot where George Eliot was bom. 

"She wasn't bom here," said this 
sympathetic and kindly soul, "she was 
bom at Arbury Farm, though she did 
live here for many years." 

This was a blow. We had wasted our 
emotions, we had wept and applauded 
in the wrong place, and after a further 
exchange of civilities we returned to the 
carriage and taxed John with having 
made a mistake. (For, to our shame 
be it confessed, Baedeker had that day 
been left behind, and memory proved 
but a yielding staff.) And thereupon 
he waxed so emphatic, declaring that 
everybody knew Griff House to be the 
birthplace of Mary Ann Evans, and. 
moreover, he looked so like a local 
oracle, destined to develop into an Old- 
est Inhabitant, that we knew not what 
to think, and, perplexed and depressed, 
drove on to Chilvers Coton, the Shep- 
perton of the " Scenes from Clerical 
Life." 

Chilvers Coton, a suburb of dull, 
 

workaday Nuneaton, is not a place to 
invite the eye. It is, indeed, "a flat, 
ugly district . . . depressing enough to 
look at even on the brightest days," 
and the little commonplace church is 
close neighbor to a crowded yard of 
" the happy dead people." The building 
was locked, and thereupon we besieged 
the comfortable, old-fashioned vicarage, 
to ask for the key. A trim, rosy maid 
appeared at the door, and took the 
words from our mouths. "The key, 
miss.? Yes, miss. And perhaps you 
wish to see Milly's grave!" So in a 
half-dream we entered the little homely 
structure, and walked into the very pew 
where Mary Ann Evans used to sit, in 
those years when, as she confesses, 
" my nurse found it necessary to provide 
for the reenforcement of my devotional 
patience, by smuggling bread and butter 
into the sacred edifice." The improve- 
ments she once deplored as having 
marred the picture retained by her 
childish memory have yet left the 
church very quaint and characteristic ; 
the pews are old-fashioned, the gal- 
leries delightful. It is easy to feel in 
that atmosphere as if one were within 
 

a very few layers of the heart of 
country life. Then out into the church- 
yard again, where, surrounded by a 
high railing and weighted with a heavy 
tombstone, lies the grave of Emma 
Gwyther, who died at thirty-four, and 
whose sad fortunes were mirrored in 
those of Milly Barton. We left the spot, 
touched and saddened, as one who has 
looked on some most sacred relic of the 
past; wherever Mary Ann Evans was 
bom, we had at least read here one 
chapter of her thoughtful, image-storing 
childhood. Thereupon, like a persistent 
insect, came buzzing back the forgotten 
question, "Marry, where vfdiS she born?" 
Not that it made any difference, since 
she once walked among us, but that the 
spirit of investigation forbade inglori- 
ous defeat. And then it was that a 
new version of Launcelot Gobbo's im- 
mortal dialogue between conscience and 
the fiend was again enacted, and with 
the world-old result. " Run ! '' cried the 
fiend in conclusion, and we said to our 
driver, " Back to Griff House ! " set 
our lips and abided the event. I think 
John must have suspected us of contem- 
plating some deed of darkness, for he 


was in his turn resolute of countenance, 
as if, should Mr. Evans charge upon the 
besiegers, he had made up his mind to 
fly, hot-foot, to Coventry, leaving us in 
the lurch. But prudence had been quite 
abandoned with decorum, and walking 
up to the teeth of the enemy, we 
knocked for admittance at the door of 
GrifE House. Then appeared again the 
decent serving - woman, and we threw 
ourselves on her mercy. We were tossed 
about by winds of doctrine; would she 
tell us her grounds for saying that Mary 
Ann Evans was not born here ? She 
smiled, as if it made very little differ- 
ence, and yet indulgently, as one might 
over the vagaries of uneasy Americans, 
inclined to spend their nervous energy 
in fighting windmills and hunting lions, 
and repeated her tale. But in the midst 
of it she stopped to listen, evidently to 
a call from within, and, after a word of 
apology, hastened up the stairs. She 
was soon back again, this time bearing 
a message. " Miss Evans says you may 
walk in the garden, miss, if you like." 
(Poor Miss Evans ! should we take this 
as the spontaneous impulse of a kindly 
heart, or was it a sop thrown to im- 


known barbarians, whom she expected 
presently in her bed-chamber?) At 
all events, we stayed not to question 
motives, but betook ourselves, with our 
gentle-mannered guide, to a fascinating 
old-fashioned garden at the back of the 
house, and there it was that an excit- 
ing and terrible event befell. For she 
suddenly exclaimed, in an undertone, 
"There is Mr. Evans himself! You 
can ask him where she was bom ! " and 
fled, leaving us in the presence of a 
tall, powerful man, clad in gray, and 
pushing a lawn - mower. There was 
notliing for us to do but flee also, or 
brazenly advance ; to our everlasting 
discredit, be it recorded that we chose 
the latter and ignoble course. Now, I 
confess that when I fell into talk with 
this quiet English land-agent, it was 
from a mood as uplifted and delirious 
as that of one who should " see Shelley 
plain," for it was borne in upon me that 
here, in the flesh, was Tom Tulliver, 
honest, stanch, indomitable of will, — 
yet not of wide vision and ever con- 
scious of his own infallibility. ("And 
the worst of it is," once said a clever 
woman, "that he not only thought so, 
 

but according to recognized standards 
Tom always was right.") This was the 
man with whose being George Eliot's 
own was knit during the most plastic 
period of her life, who could admit her 
to the highest heaven of happiness, as 
Tom had ever the power of doing in 
his intercourse with Maggie, and whose 
disapproval, even over so small a matter 
as the jam puffs, would poison the very 
fountain of her content. This was he 
of whom she wrote, 

" My doll seemed lifeless, and no girlish toy 
Had any reason, when my brother came." 

It was Tom, the real or imagined 
Tom, who praised her because, in a 
moment of still and happy dreaming, she 
caught a big fish, and learned thereby 
how "luck is with glory wed." It was 
Tom who was separated from her by 
that awful soul-distance brought about 
by "the dire years;" who perchance 
condemned where he could not under- 
stand, and drew from her at length the 
home-sick cry, 

" But were another childhood-world my share, 
I would be bom a little sister there." 

Here, for all present purposes, was 
Tom Tulliver, gray-bearded, with keen 
 

yet kindly gray eyes and a slow sad 
voice, — and oh, wonder ! with George 
Eliot's own Dante nose. Do you remem- 
ber when sweet Mary Seraskier came 
back to Peter Ibbetson from the outer, 
or mayhap the inner world, how he 
tried so vainly, in his waking moments, 
to recall her utterances, and put them 
into the language of every-day thought 
and speech ? Thus it happened when I 
talked with Tom Tulliver. I meant, for 
my own after-delight, to remember his 
phrasing exactly as it left his lips, but I 
can only repeat it now, hopelessly Amer- 
icanized. 

" No, she was not born here," he said. 
" She was bom at Arbury Farm, and 
brought here when she was but six 
months old." 

" And which was her window ? Where 
is her room ? " 

"Why, she was everywhere about the 
house," he answered, in his ponderous 
fashion. " She lived here." 

But it was evident that the George 
Eliot of universal fame was less to him 
than the little sister whose " tiny shoe " 
he had guided over the stepping-stones, 
so many years agone. He was half 
 

touched, half perplexed that we should 
be thus moved over the traces of their 
vanished youth. 

" You came from America ? " he asked. 
"It's along way." 

And then, when we stammeringly 
tried to tell him how we had first of all 
sought Shakespeare's home, inevitably 
to make this the second step in our 
pilgrimage of praise and worship, his 
reserve seemed to break up, as if, she 
being dead, he would thank the humblest 
soul for having loved her. 

"And youVe been to the church.?" 
he asked. " Ah, they Ve altered it ! 
You may see the pew where she used to 
sit, but in those days its walls were so 
high that she had to stand up on the 
seat to see the singers." (Still dream- 
ing over the child, and not the girl or 
woman ! Did she know, and was it an 
abiding joy that ever, in the home of his 
mind, she dwelt "a little sister" }) 

Needless to say that we did not linger, 
afraid of outstaying his tolerance. 

"And you will go to Arbury Farm ?" 
he asked, adding, after full directions for 
finding it, " Tell them I sent you." 

We left him in his garden and wan- 


dered at will for a moment, casting un- 
seeing eyes at the farm buildings and 
populous yard, where little Maggie light- 
heartedly trudged about, or brooded over 
the "bitter sorrows of childhood." 

It was all so faithful, so real! and 
nothing more so than the true present- 
ment of Tom, grown to man's estate. 
This was the apex of human experi- 
ence, so far as our present quest was 
concerned ; not only could we imagine 
the outer life of the fine spirit forever 
vanished, but we had seen him who was 
so responsible for a vast part of its 
emotional stress. Yet there was, and 
is to-day, a bitter drop in that jeweled 
cup ; we had behaved like the tradi- 
tional American whose gospel is " Push," 
and had earned thereby the condemna- 
tion pronounced upon such from of old 
by the courteous and the gentle. One 
grace only was left in us ; we kept our 
own counsel, lest other intrusive spirits, 
possibly worse than the first, should re- 
peat our deed, and still further persecute 
our patient host. But time and fate 
between them have taken the seal from 
our lips, — for the master of Griff House 
is dead. 



It is the eccentric dower of some to 
grow quite as hot-headed and tremulous 
over a prospective needle in a haymow 
as ever Midas could have been on 
receiving his gift. To such, Knutsford, 
in Cheshire, offers a perfect hunting- 
ground for that sort of plunder so 
humorously resembling Gratiano's rea- 
sons : " You shall seek all day ere you 
find them; and when you have them, 
they are not worth the search." No 
more satisfying occupation can be in- 
vented in this ancient world than the 
pursuit of what does not absolutely ex- 
ist, if only the hunter be just credulous 
enough ; bold in belief, yet " not too 
bold." He must cling to his guesswork 
with a dauntless zeal ; at the same time 
he shall, for his own ease, recognize 
the probable futility of such doggedness. 
For to reconstruct a habitation on the 
base of some foregone romance is to 
strike a balance between special disap- 
pointment and a vague general joy. 
 

The present Knutsford, in toto, is 
emphatically not the Cranford of Mrs. 
Gaskeirs homely chronicle, but it glit- 
ters with links of similitude ; moreover, 
a certain quaintness all its own is 
continually stimulating the mind to 
comparison between the fancied and 
the real, as living perfumes summon 
forth old memories. Here, at least, 
Mrs. Gaskell was a child, the little 
Elizabeth Cleghom Stevenson, storing 
up fragmentary impressions easily re- 
traced by one who has lived even a full 
day in the town ; here she was married, 
and in the green and pleasant yard of 
the old Unitarian Chapel she lies, with 
her husband, under lilies of the valley 
and the constant evergreen. The pros- 
pect of figuring in biography was never 
quite to her taste, and the simple facts 
of her life oflFer little temptation to 
literary gossip-mongers. Her mother 
was a Holland, of the family repre- 
sented now by Lord Knutsford. Little 
Elizabeth was bom at Chelsea in 1810, 
and it was after her mother's death that 
she was sent to live with Mrs. Lumb, a 
widowed aunt, at Knutsford, where she 
remained until marriage took her to per- 


manent residence in Manchester. Both 
her husband and her father were Unita- 
rian clergymen, and one can guess at 
her own gracious influence among that 
slowly growing sect, a power as moving 
as in literature and the practical walks 
of trade. It is an old story that her 
fiction taught the rich some of those 
trenchant lessons known at first-hand 
only by the poor ; but another deed, 
more golden yet, shall be remembered 
of her, — the creation of Cranford, a 
book to be loved so long as there are 
smiles and tears in this April world. 
Who could aspire to uncover its living 
presentment ? One might as well hope, 
some fortunate London hour, to stumble 
on Queen Bess setting forth in state to 
buU-baiting or the play. 

The region skirting Knutsford on 
every hand is rich in memories, but, 
better still, it offers a loving welcome 
to the eye. It is a placid, smiling 
country, diversified by great estates and 
happy in fat farmlands. Great herds of 
cows idle about, given over to that in- 
dustry which is no more than a drowsy 
day-dream ; cropping and chewing, and 
transmuting the riches of the common 
 

sod into such milk and cheese as need 
only naming for praise. Within the 
circle of this abounding prosperity lies 
the little town (ford of the great Ca- 
nute, some say, with reason), a lovable 
spot, irregular and pleasing, with individ- 
ual comers and passages covered by the 
dust of years, and delighting in their 
burial. It is presided over by two 
precise and respectable inns, both men- 
tioned "by name" in Cranford. So 
many of the strings of trade here are 
held by women that it is still approxi- 
mately, as in Cranford days, "in pos- 
session of the Amazons." No state of 
things could be more pleasing to us who 
would have time "stand still withal," 
and on the strength of it we may 
undoubtedly assume that, even in our 
present year of grace, "to be a man" 
is, in this delectable place, "to be 
'vulgar.'" 

Our course thither lay through Man- 
chester (Drumble), where we made brief 
halt to glance at the Unitarian Chapel, 
the old preaching-ground of the Rev- 
erend William Gaskell, and we reached 
Knutsford on the eve of a festival 
calculated to rend dear Miss Matty 
 

with deeper doubts than such as embit- 
tered her first half -hour at Signor 
Brunoni's exhibition. For the next 
afternoon had been set apart for 
May-day celebration, and Knutsford was 
already the scene of a wild saturnalia. 
It had lost its head in anticipatory 
delirium. It was baking and brewing 
for a probable influx of visitors by 
excursion train. The very air was 
tinged with the aroma of hot cakes, 
and landladies who on any other day 
would have curtsied profoundly in 
Shenstonian welcome, actually held their 
door-stone against us as though we 
were marauding Scots, or the rogues 
and vagabonds of a later interdict, ex- 
plaining: "It's so very, very awkward, 
miss, but to-morrow I shall be so busy ; 
and I could hardly give you the atten- 
tion I should wish. I'm very sorry, 
miss, but you see how it is, miss, I 'm 
sure ; " with that ingratiating lift at the 
end of the sentence so commendable 
on an English tongue. 

And so perforce we went to an inn, 
choosing, in deference to Cranford pre- 
judice, one under the firm and affable 
sway of two ladies. At that modest 
 

choice, said we, the Honorable Mrs. 
Jamieson would have been the better 
pleased. All that evening the delirium 
of hope and expectation continued. 
Swings had been erected on the large 
open space still known as " the Heath." 
Red-and-gold gondolas, cannily set upon 
springs, were gayly sliding about in 
a magic circle, — a lurid Venice. A 
strange aerial railway consisted of one 
strong wire high in air ; little wheels 
with handles on either side were 
arranged to fit it, and Darby or Joan, 
holding to the handles with desperate 
grip, went trundling through space like 
gibbeted criminals taking to the sky. 
The company of psychologists shall 
henceforth be augmented by the man 
who classifies the soul according to the 
bodily contortions induced by an aerial 
railway. I know not what he should 
be called, but his course of action will 
be plain. Especially in the case of 
womankind might he pronounce an 
unerring judgment, — for some among 
the lassies curled their dangling feet 
decently beneath their skirts, some let 
them fly amain ; others swayed like wil- 
low wands ; but the many swept on their 
 

playful way like very statues. In all 
there was one strange likeness: they 
took their pleasure " sadly," as became 
true Britons. No face relaxed; not a 
feature gave way to emotion lighter 
than a rigid determination to reach the 
goal. With the onlookers, the same 
seriousness prevailed, so that when the 
transatlantic observer gave way to hys- 
terics of mirth, she was regarded, not 
frowningly, but with a solemn com- 
passion which was in itself hopelessly 
upsetting. And over all the din of de- 
corous joy amid which the Knutsford 
youth thus disported itself arose the 
voice of china -venders and toy -mer- 
chants, the cry of those who would fain 
cloy their countrymen with gruesome 
lollipop and other sweets, made only to 
be shunned. Miss Deborah could never 
have approved ! We tried to cloak our 
delight under a decent thoughtfulness, 
and went home to bed. I think we 
should even have read a counter-irritating 
chapter of Rasselas had that very emi- 
nent work been at hand. 

Next day, Knutsford dissolved in rain, 
and the bakeries may well have wept 
also. No crowd of excursionists to race 
 

into the town like an invading flood, 
some ripple of which must surely inun- 
date the humblest eating-houses ! They 
sank beneath their sweets, like Tarpeia 
under her bribe, and the cardboard le- 
gend of "Tea" at every door fell into 
pulp and sadness. We too had hoped 
for a sunny May-day ; but, being mortal, 
we could not refrain from an acrid reflec- 
tion that many a landlady must now be 
repenting her short-sighted refusal of us. 
Last night we were minnows, for there 
were other fish in the sea. To-day we 
loomed as the leviathan, and we bore our- 
selves proudly. 

Only a few optimistic citizens had 
summoned the spirit to sand the side- 
walk in front of their houses, an ancient 
custom once accompanying Knutsford 
weddings, and still employed on days of 
high festival. Still, no one exerted his 
genius to the utmost ; for though the 
sand had been applied in patterns, they 
were quite simple, suggesting none of 
that elaboration and originality of design 
in which Knutsford can indulge when 
she chooses. But though the rain could 
bully her into curbing her handiwork, 
it could not dampen her poetic ardor. 
 

Across the street, from one sandless 
sidewalk to the other, swept a banner, 
and this was the proud legend there- 
of:— 

" All hall ! All haO thee, Queen of May I 
For this is our universal holiday !" 

A melancholy dryness, flecked by 
uncertain gleams of sun, succeeded the 
forenoon, and we betook ourselves, with 
an unadulterated joy, to the Heath, 
where we sat, chilled and happy, on the 
grand stand, watching the festival, and 
reconstructing the play-day of Old Eng- 
land from the too sophisticated pleas- 
ures of the New. This was May-day 
decked out in modem fripperies for the 
public entertainment, but it was not 
impossible to spy, beneath its lendings, 
the simpler sports of a long-past time. 
The procession was an historical pageant 
of high degree. Here walked Sir Wal- 
ter Raleigh, Lord Nelson, the Duke 
of Wellington, Dick Whittington, and 
Robin Hood, none of them over four 
feet high. Jack-in-the-Green danced, 
bear -wise, under an inverted cone of 
hemlock; the morris - dancers (lithe, 
bonny youths, dressed in blue velvet 
kneebreeches, white shirts, plaid sashes, 


and stockings of a vivid pink seldom 
seen outside a lozenge jar) wove a simple 
rhythm of movement entrancing to the 
eye, and the May queen rode in state, 
a pygmy lady of fashion, clad in white 
satin, elaborate, frosty, like a wedding- 
cake. But one would fain have seen 
her in simple white muslin enriched 
only with posies of her own plucking, 
gathered with the dew on them while 
even Corinna slept. "Wake and call 
me early," that I may hook myself into 
a ball dress and send for my wired 
bouquet ! Some bathos comes with 
time. 

But of all that winding throng one ob- 
ject alone had power to thrill the mind, 
— an old sedan chair, borne midway in 
the procession. Do you remember it in 
the annals of Cranford? Within that 
very chair did Miss Matty sit, tremulous 
but resolved, after the social evening at 
Mrs. Forrester's, when the dear ladies 
scared one another into panic with con- 
fession of the bogies most to their mind. 
From its unsafe seclusion did she cry 
aloud when the men " stopped just where 
Headingley Causeway branches off from 
Darkness Lane : ' Oh ! pray go on ! 
 

What is the matter ? What is the mat- 
ter ? I will give you sixpence more to 
go on very fast ; pray don't stop here.' " 
Dear relic of a time more real than our 
to-day ! Knutsford holds nothing more 
precious. 

The Maypole dance was given over to 
a set of decorous little girls in flower-like 
dresses, green and pink. They tripped 
it prettily, they braided and wove their 
ribbons round the pole, but the sponta- 
neous joy of Old and Merrie England 
was not in them. A dancing-master had 
trained them for the public eye. Step 
and look were no longer the springing 
welcome to a day when lads and lassies 
should no more be able to hold their 
fervor than trees their budding strength. 
To watch these puppets tripping it was 
to give way for a moment to sadness, re- 
flecting that nowadays we are ashamed 
to be merry after we have come to man's 
estate. We give over our great festivals 
to children, and then sit looking on with 
a maddening tickle in the bones that 
ache to join them. 

With another day Knutsford had as- 
sumed her wonted air of quiescent deco- 
rum. It proved easier to see her now 
 

for what she is, a Georgian town imbued 
with the spirit of elegance and precision; 
easy, too, to find Cranford in her every 
look and word. On that morning began 
our trial of local intelligence and belief. 
But a step from the Angel Hotel (where 
Lord Mauleverer very wisely took up his 
quarters, though doubtless when it still 
remained on the other side of the way) 
stands the Royal George, once living 
content under its swinging sign of the 
saint militant, but now thrown into self- 
contradiction by the swelling adjective 
assumed after the Princess Victoria and 
the Duchess of Kent had spent a night 
under its roof. (An affectionate trait in 
this loyal people, to weaken a saint's pat- 
ronymic by courtly prefix.) Now it was 
this same George which was sought out 
by Miss Pole on an idle morning, when 
nothing more importunate prevented her 
from strolling up the staircase, on benev- 
olence intent. For, said Miss Pole, " my 
Betty has a second-cousin who is cham- 
bermaid there, and I thought Betty 
would like to hear how she was." And, 
quite by chance, she found herself in 
the passage leading from the inn to the 
Assembly Room, and then in the room 
 

itself, where Signer Brunoni was mak- 
ing his preparations to juggle the wits 
out of Cranford the very next night. 
This was the room where, on that bewil- 
dering evening, the ladies of Cranford 
were so astounded by the resources of 
magic that they began to debate whether 
they had been in the right " to have come 
to see such things," and settled down to 
an unalloyed enjoyment of the evening 
only on learning that the " tall, thin, dry, 
rusty rector," insured against feminine 
wiles by a cohort of National School 
boys, sat "smiling approval." Memory 
more endearing still, it was the Assem- 
bly Room where Miss Matty sighed a lit- 
tle over her departed youth, and walked 
" mincingly, ... as if there were a num- 
ber of genteel observers, instead of two 
little boys with a stick of toffy between 
them with which to beguile the time." 
To seek it out was like dreaming over a 
bit of dear Miss Matty's shawl or a print 
of her turban. 

The George is rich in modern antiqui- 
ties, — carven balustrades, beautiful old 
clocks, and precious work in brass. It 
is a living example of the actual mag- 
nificence which may be wrapped about 
 

an inn when it has maintained itself in 
dignity, and conceded nothing to the 
flight of time or change of ownership. 
Something stately lies in its hospitable 
repose. Like the ladies themselves, it 
clings resolutely to old possessions, 
though all the world without may clamor 
for the changes falsely named improve- 
ment. Owing to that deplorable lack 
of understanding which is incident to 
the present of any age, we were con- 
ducted, with flourish of pride, through 
the George to the new Assembly Room, 
aggressively fresh against the back- 
ground of Cranford legends, and that 
night tricked out with masonic regalia. 
"Is this all?'' cried we, in unhappy 
duet. " Has the old hall been quite 
swept away } " By no means ! Did we 
wish to see that i " A very plain room, 
miss ! " And thither were we led, to 
find it shabby, ancient, lovable, — its 
tinted walls, dull as a fading memory, 
reflecting to the seeing eye a hundred 
scenes of innocent yet decorous revelry. 
Here Miss Matty took her dainty steps 
in the vienuets de la couvy her young 
head, crowned with its soft thick locks 
(" I had very pretty hair, my dear," said 
 

Miss Matilda), sinking in shyness super- 
added to decorum when young Holbrook 
came to lead her to the dance. Here she 
should have worn the muslin from India 
that came to her too late, poor Matty. 
Here, too. Miss Pole gleaned the fruitful 
grain of gossip, to sow it carefully again ; 
for in youth as in age Miss Pole must 
ever have been the mouthpiece of the 
world which tattles and denies. Some- 
how I can never connect Miss Debo- 
rah with the Assembly Room. I fancy 
she was but an abstracted figure at the 
balls; wishing herself away in a more 
serious atmosphere, dreaming over the 
ponderous delight of sitting at home 
and writing the charges of the arch- 
deacon she was so eminently fitted to 
marry. 

In the old days, the George had gates 
of its own, but now a free passage leads 
under the building (somewhat in the 
fashion of Clovelly's wayward street), 
past the stables, and up a slope, where, 
directly facing the pedestrian who as- 
cends that way, stands a shop, pointed 
out by universal acclaim as the one 
where, after the downfall of her for- 
times, Miss Matty sold tea and scattered 

comfits. It is presided over by an ex- 
cellent chemist, a man of solemn aspect 
and an unconscious humor. A tradition 
lurks in Cranford that he was once 
sought out by the Unitarian clergyman 
of the town, on the supposition that he 
was an adherent of that faith. The cru- 
cial question was asked. 

" Oh, ay,'' responded master chemist, 
" I am a Unitarian. Indeed, sir, I 'm 
almost an agnostic ! '' Rude, belligerent 
word to have penetrated the sacred pale 
of Cranford ! 

We entered the tiny establishment on 
some ostensible errand. 

"Is this Miss Matty's shop.?" we 
inquired incidentally, the while our pur- 
chase was sought. 

" Yes, miss," was the unhesitating 
answer. "We are repairing the back 
room a bit, or you could see the little 
window she used to peep through when 
she heard a customer." 

Was reality so wedded to fiction ? 
Actual windows and imaginary Miss 
Mattys were here in droll conjunction. 
Further questioning elicited a reason 
strangely alluring from the very empha- 
sis informing the chaos of its terms. 

 

For it seems that there was in town an 
aged gentlewoman, the only existing 
link between old times and new, who 
chanced to enter the shop after the pa- 
per had been torn away, disclosing this 
tiny window ; and she from her stores 
of memory drew the assertion that this 
was Miss Matty's window, because she 
had seen it many a time and recognized 
it at once. Amorphous logic and fortu- 
nate conclusion ! 

"Now," said we encouragingly to mas- 
ter chemist, " of course you know all the
