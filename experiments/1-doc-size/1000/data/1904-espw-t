Aunt Cornelia's tears fell fast upon the mu- 
tilated dog. 

Mrs. Jeffries and her dearest lawyer sat to- 
gether in the library. It was now mid-after- 
noon, and Surbridge, cheerfully cutting an 
hour from the busiest portion of his day, had 
already surrendered himself to the task of 
soothing the soul of his most adoring and 
most difficult client. 

"Put yourself in my place," said Aunt 
Cornelia solemnly. 

" That, my dear madam," returned Philip 




with his perfect manner, " I have often done 

— with envy." 

" There you are — your father all over 
again. You are very graceful, Philip, but 
you don't help me out as much as usual. If 
you were I, what, I should like to know, 
would you do in this extraordinary situa- 
tion?" 

"Accept it," said Philip quietly, " like the 
grande dame you are." 

" Yes, but not in a minute — not with a 
gasp. I haven't even had time for a good cry. 
Here I find the jDress of the city busied with 
our affairs — the privacy of this household 
endangered — that boy and his poodle on 
everybody's lips — your name in every paper 

— my niece's ostentatiously suppressed. I 
suppose we have you to thank for that." 

"Well, yes," drawled Philip. "I did my 
best." 

" I find Dr. Steele pilloried — whether justly 
or not, how do I know? I find my niece's 
imminent engagement to him indefinitely post- 
poned. I find that he has resigned the presi- 
dency of our noble society. I am overwhelmed 
with the responsibilities this will bring upon 



 

my poor head. I find upstairs — mysteriously 
returned to this family — a mangled dog. I 
find an evidently greater mystery behind him. 
Nobody tells me how he came to be as he is. 
Miriam positively refuses to speak about him. 
I must say, it would have been a great deal 
better for that child if he had been dead as 
she thought he was." 

Philip held up his firm and gentle hand, 
as if he were flagging a train. Mrs. Jeffries 
slowed up, and in a few quiet words the lawyer 
told her the whole story. 

Aunt Cornelia received this recital as if she 
had been struck between the eyes. The con- 
ventionality of her nature yielded hard, and 
she was convinced that no lady in her class of 
society had ever been put in such an embar- 
rassing position. She found it not quite natu- 
ral to suppose that Miriam was not, somehow, 
to blame. 

" If you had been in her place," urged 
Philip, " with your youth and beauty, and 
your warm heart " — 

"Well," admitted Aunt Cornelia, "I sup- 
pose I should have done the same thing." 

" Of course you would ! " insisted Philip, 



 

in his convincing tone. " Knowing you as I 
do, I should not even raise the question." 

" But, Philip, there is one thing more — 
and I have left that to the last on purpose. 
I go up into the attic, and I find that boy from 
the slums apparently established there with 
his poodle. I ask him if he is making another 
visit, and he says, No, he is staying. I have 
not approached Miriam at all upon this painful 
subject. I feel it too keenly. I am getting to 
be an old woman, and I wish I were in my 
own home. I find this house turned into a 
dog hospital and an orphan asylum. I was not 
brought up to such methods of life. Mr. Jef- 
fries liked to live as other people did ; our 
tastes were in perfect accord." 

Philip got up and put his hand upon his 
client's shoulder with that affectionate and 
protecting sympathy to which age is so much 
more sensitive than youth. 

" Dear Mrs. Jeffries, don't you see ? How 
could she do anythmg else? How coidd she 
send the poor chap away after what has hap- 
pened ? She never would have known an easy 
hour. It 's just like her. She 's adopted the 
lad — and Trixy — into the family." 



 

"Is he going to sit at the table?" de- 
manded Mrs. Jeffries, weeping. " Or perhaps 
they 'll both sit at the table ? She might give 
Trixy a high chair. She 's capable of it." 

Surbridge lausfhed outright. 

" Oh, Matthew and Maggie have bespoken 
their company. Now, dear Mrs. Jeffries, there 
is one queer thing about it nobody can ex- 
plain. Those two dogs have met before — 
in fact, they are practically inseparable. Any- 
thing that Caro wants in this house the poor 
fellow 's likely to have, I fancy, for the rest 
of his life. And I 'm sure you would be the 
very last person to wish to have it other- 
wise." 

Aunt Cornelia looked up, smiling. She had 
that rare expression which blurs the wrinkles 
out of an elderly face. No one but Philip 
ever saw it. 

" You are a dear boy," she said, " and an 
irresistible pleader. Like your father, you 'll 
be a distinguished lawyer some day. I never 
could withstand you." 

Philip did not answer, for at that moment 
Miriam entered the room. She had the injured 
dog in her arms, and Trixy danced behind 



 

her, like a pretty page, holding the train of 
her gown, and shaking it daintily. 

Miriam stopped for a moment, irresolute ; 
then, advancing, she stooped and kissed her 
Aunt Cornelia, and laid the spaniel in the 
lady's lustreless black silk lap. Trixy, jealous 
of this attention, jumped up and cuddled be- 
side her little friend. 

"Oh, well," sighed Mrs. Jeffries, "Mr. 
Surbridge says we must make the best of it, 
Trixy. Give me your hand. What are you 
laughing at, Philip ? " 

Philip pointed to the door, where Dan, 
irradiate, stood leaning on his crutch. Dan 
found it quite beyond the question now to 
have Trixy out of his sight ; for her, his eyes 
had become clairvoyant, his ears clairaudient. 
Trixy had always reserved her private doubts 
about her master's omnipotence ; his omni- 
presence was now a fact established beyond 
reach of skepticism. 



CHAPTER XIII 

The court-room was stifling, for the unsavory 
place was full. A strange array packed it to 
the doors, and beyond. When had the lower 
courts of the city known such an interplay of 
human rank? The old images of theology 
occurred to more than one person that morn- 
ing — the visions of childhood as they formed 
fearfully about the Day of the Last Judgment, 
when "great and small" should stand before 
the Judge. For, since it had gone abroad that 
a brilliant and daring young attorney (him- 
self of a social status from which one would 
have expected other, not to say better things) 
had proceeded against a great institution in 
behalf of a boy from the slums whose dog 
was mysteriously concerned, the extremes of 
society had thronged to this unprecedented, 
to this incredible trial. 

Gentlemen of the clubs and of the drawing- 
rooms protected clusters of ladies who had 
never set their delicate feet in such a spot be- 



 

fore. Fans and vinaigrettes agitated and 
protested against the polluted atmosphere of 
justice to which judge and lawyers were so 
used that they were conscious of surprise 
at the discomfort experienced by the leisure 
classes. 

Early seated, and crowded to the front, was 
to be noticed a group so unfamiliar to, and 
so unfamiliar with the criminal courts that it 
attracted a curious, something like a sympa- 
thetic attention. This was an academic group 
— a few professors, the dean of the involved 
institution, several men bearing the unmis- 
takable air of trustees, one of the defend- 
ants (understood to be an instructor), and, 
sitting beside him uneasily, the janitor of the 
medical school. The college counsel, a distin- 
guished lawyer, had an expression of patient 
ennui, as one who regarded the occasion 
small and irritating, and his case, in the 
nature of things, assured. Physicians and 
medical students of such types as the modern 
schools turn out jammed every permissible 
space. Lawyers were present in considerable 
numbers. 

Uncomfortably aware that they were but 



 

coldly welcomed by " the other half of the 
world " in this extraordinary scene, yet stol- 
idly defiant of the fact, sat the uninfluential, 
the obscure, the children of the poor — whom 
we are accustomed to forget until we need 
them — the plain and powerful people whose 
voice is apt to be clearer, and sure to be 
stronger in the moral note than our own. 

These had come up to champion one of them- 
selves — an orphan lad, at whose instance the 
great medical school was placed in a position 
hitherto unimagined, and embarrassing to an 
obvious decree. 

The day was cold (it was January) and a 
threatened storm was frowning. The court- 
room was not quite dark enough to light arti- 
ficially, but so dull of tint that, when an arrow 
of sun ran through the army of clouds charg- 
ing across the sky, and stabbed a window, 
the effect was followed by every eye in the 
room. It so chanced that the poignant ray 
struck the lame lad's attorney, who had at that 
moment risen, and stood preeminent in the 
brilliance — his tall height, his strong head, 
his direct features expressing a certain straight- 
forwardness and manly sincerity, a certain fear- 



 

lessness in moral matters united to a marked 
intellectual force, which commanded instinc- 
tive respect. 

His little client, who sat silent and pale be- 
low him, stirred sensitively as the sunlight faded 
slowly from Surbridge's face and figure, and 
the boy glanced towards the rear of the room 
where his neighbors and friends from Blind 
Alley were crowded together. Among them, 
yet clearly to the most careless eye not of 
them, a lady, closely veiled, sheltered a small 
object behind her muff. A tiny white ear, 
cocked alertly above the dark fur, was fol- 
lowed by a little struggling white face, rebel- 
lious and determined. The lame boy held up 
one finger, and the little face disappeared from 
sight as the proceedings of the day began. 

The preliminaries were disposed of rather 
quickly, and with that indifference to social 
claims or intellectual position characteristic of 
abstract justice, and of the concrete judge pre- 
siding — an eccentric man, with an irritable 
mouth, a kind eye, and an imperious manner. 
The distinguished scientists (from whose num- 
ber Professor Steele was conspicuously absent) 
involved in this extraordinary complication 



 

were conscious of a vexed surprise at their 
position. The academic world is not a wide 
one, the scientific portion of it least endowed 
with imagination, and neither experience nor 
fancy had prepared these gentlemen for a se- 
rious legal situation ; where the latest bacillus 
or the new serum was without palpable sig- 
nificance, where the standards of the lecture- 
room, the achievements of the laboratory, or 
the reputation of a coterie went for nothing. 
The fact that they might go for less than 
nothing occurred slowly to Dr. Bernard (all 
his mental processes were leisurely) when he 
found himself, like any common, uninstructed 
fellow, summoned to the bar. 

The complaint was read rather impressively. 
It was an incredibly vulgar charge — that of 
receiving stolen property. To this Charles 
Claudius Bernard, Instructor, and Thomas 
Sleigh, Janitor of Galen Medical School, sev- 
erally pleaded not guilty : and the trial pro- 
gressed as briskly as possible. 

Surbridge, who handled the case from the 
outset in a manner as unconventional as the 
most conventional of professions allowed him, 
made a brief and blazing opening of the sort 



 

which led lawyers who did not know him to 
whisper : " Effective. But theatricals won't 
carry this case. It needs a stone-crusher." 

" Wait," answered an elderly member of 
the bar, "you 'll have both before he gets 
through. I knew his father." 

The witnesses for the prosecution were put 
forward rapidly — it seemed to be Surbridge's 
purpose to avoid tiring the court — and, de- 
layed only by the inevitable cross-examination, 
these presented their testimony, on the whole, 
with a clearness which indicated rather an 
unusual drill, or unusual harmony between 
counsel and witness. 

Daniel Badger took his oath solemnly, as 
if he had been undergoing- initiation vows at 
the Lodge of the Grand Mooses. He testified 
distinctly in his plaintive voice. Now and then 
he gestured a little with his crutch ; he had a 
pleasing expression of confidence in the judge, 
not entirely lost upon his Honor, whose sharp 
lips curved into a withered smile when the lad, 
suddenly overborne by the pathos of his story, 
forgetting that he had been directed only to 
answer questions, leaned heavily upon his 
crutch, lifted one thin hand high in the air 



 

(apparently under the impression that he was 
taking another oath), and, before Surbridge 
could stop him, thus personally addressed the 
Bench : 

" Ye see, Judge, Trixy she 's all I got. 
Me V Trixy haven't anybody but her 'n' me. 
It was tumble to steal Trixy. It ain't so much 
them shows and her bein' edoocated — you 
never see a dog know so much as Trixy does — 
an' folks have to make a livin' — me 'n' Trixy 
used to make ourn before she was took away 
from me that time. But that ain't it. I 'd 'a' 
starved, Judge, and welcome, any day, an' I 
wouldn't 'a' minded much — I druther most 
anything than have anything happen to Trixy." 

Here Surbridge, inwardly delighted, felt 
bound to interpose. 

"You may go on, my lad," said the judge 
indulgently. " It may be of help in getting 
at the facts," he added, leveling a straight 
glance at the respectful protest in the face 
of the colWe counsel. " Let us hear what 
the boy has to say." 

" She played so pretty, too," proceeded 
Dan with quavering voice. " Didn't ye never 
see her play, Judge? It warn't only ten 



 

cents a head. She ain't like most dogs, Trixy 
ain't. She's a little girl in dog's close, Trixy 
is. An' then ye see she 's so small, Judge. It 
warn't as if she was a bull-dog, or something 
big. Trixy couldn't help herself — she was a 
little dog. It warn't right of them fellars. 
They was grown-up men. They stole my little 
dog. I seen her. I seen her in that college. 
They was a goin' to cut her up alive. I hearn 
a fellar say so. They was goin' — to — cut — 
Trixy — up — alive. I tell ye, Judge, I seen 
her in the machine. She had a bit acrosst her 
mouth — so — she was crying somethin' awful. 
It was a turrible thing for them fellars to treat 
Trixy so — now warn't it ? You wouldn't ha' 
treated her that way yourself, Judge, would 
you?" 

Dan sat down trembling. He was very white, 
and went a trifle faint. He felt that he had 
disobeyed Mr. Surbridge : he had spoken more 
than he was spoken to ; and he experienced a 
sick anxiety. From the rear of the room a little 
squeal, immediately muffled by something soft, 
greeted the subsidence of the complainant. 

Very ably cross-examined, Dan stuck to his 
story like a drowning excursionist to a sound 



 

life preserver. He neither slipped nor sank. 
In fact, he added so many dangerous touches 
to the evidence that the eminent college 
counsel dropped the lad as soon as he decently 
could. 

Before the emotion aroused by Dan's 
pathetic personality had wasted, Surbridge 
put in his witnesses briskly. 

Thomas Cady related the circumstances of 
the finding of the dog. He knew the dog well ; 
he was " perpared " to swear that it was the 
dog ; he saw her taken up to the medical school ; 
he did not get near enough to release the clog. 

Sarah Jenkinson, plainly a consumptive, 
' coughing heavily, offered similar testimony. 

Mary Cady reiterated and added to the 
same. She had observed the blue blanket on 
the dog as it was being dragged along. She 
had lingered behind her party, and had seen 
the man. When the man " see her watchin'," 
he ran. Mary Cady had addressed a policeman 
on the subject of the man and the dog. The 
policeman had " cussed " at Mary Cady. Mary 
Cady's testimony was rendered picturesque 
by her costume. She wore a blue coat, and a 
green hat surmounted by a blue jay, a cat- 



 

bird, and the remains of a cockatoo. Her 
brown muff bung from her neck by a pink 
ribbon. 

Cady's Molly was immediately followed by 
a witness whose appearance created evident 
agitation in the professional part of the au- 
dience. Robert Souther, practicing physician 
and surgeon, being sworn, reluctantly admitted 
that he was present in the laboratory of Dr. 
C. C. Bernard at the time when the dog was 
withdrawn from the experiment in question 
by the interference of the attorney for the 
prosecution. Dr. Souther was a middle-aged 
man with grayish hair and beard. He bore him- 
self with an air of distressed protest through- 
out the melancholy occasion to which he had 
been subpoenaed : but, being obviously a man 
who " honored his word as if it were his 
God," however unwillingly, he told the truth. 
Shrewdly cross-examined, he did not retract 
or confuse it. The dog was prepared for an 
experiment which he was invited to witness. 
He had inquired of Dr. Bernard where he had 
picked that pretty creature up. Dr. Bernard 
had replied that it came in the usual way. 
The dog was fastened to the dog-board, and 



 

the experiment was about to begin, when the 
interruption occurred. Closely pressed by the 
attorney for the prosecution, Dr. Souther 
admitted that he had regretted the sacrifice of 
the dog ; but, being a guest of the occasion, he 
had not felt at liberty to say so ; equally did 
he regret being obliged to testify against a 
colleague in this case. Yes ; he was quite sure 
that he should recognize the dog if he saw 
it. It was in no sense an ordinary dog. He 
could not deny that he was gratified that the 
dog had escaped the experiment. 

After the court had returned from luncheon 
the defense unmasked its batteries. These 
were of a resounding variety. The college 
took the position, hardly material to the issue, 
but intended to overawe, that this slight 
matter scarcely needed attention. That the 
institution could err, was plainly a social 
heresy. Its honor was not to be questioned, 
its scientific dogma was not to be barked at 
by the courts, and its methods were above 
criticism. To brinor Galen Medical School 
before the bar of the state was a species of 
lese-?najeste. 

One of the defendants, taking advantage 



of his privilege, was silent. The janitor was 
not going to run the risk of any possible 
incrimination of his valuable personality. He 
had been in office a dozen years, and had 
never been in an unpleasant position before. 
He held himself to be as unimpeachable and 
almost as important as the dean. In fact, was 
he not more necessary ? At least the " dog 
banditti " thought so. 

Witnesses were many and fluent. Doctors, 
laboratory assistants, medical students flocked 
eagerly to the defense of their school. The 
college could easily have presented ten wit- 
nesses to Surbridge's one. The expression of 
the distinguished attorney was placid and 
confident. He put forward the chief de- 
fendant without uneasiness. Dr. Bernard's 
arrogant brutality, which was not always 
popular hi professional or private life, made 
him an excellent witness in his own behalf. 
He had for so long a time regarded laymen 
with contempt that he had no fears about the 
possible outcome. Indeed, his mind was 
cloudy as to the value of the legal profession ; 
its skill he did not respect; its force he did 
not fear. Set against a scientific creed, set 



 

against a scientific fact, what were the claims 
of any other profession ? The church he de- 
spised, the state he defied with a narrow com- 
placency than which none could be more 
hopeless. 

Charles Claudius Bernard took the stand 
with insolent ease. His enormous hands 
played with the rail before him as if he had 
been stripping it of its muscles. His pro- 
minent ears seemed to a girl whose wincing 
eyes followed him behind her veil, to tarn 
forwards a little like those of a listening 
animal. He told his story in a loud voice 
that snapped now and then into the irrita- 
bility of a red-haired man. He assumed a 
position which he conjectured to be unassail- 
able. He maintained (and the judge allowed 
him the same latitude that had been allowed 
to Dan ) that it was not an instance, but 
a principle which was arraigned ; and the 
principle he defended with a certain brutal 
belief in it that was not without force. He 
applauded the practice that he represented, 
and the institution which chartered it, and 
himself. He challenged examination of his 
methods, inspection of his laboratories. To 



 

the animals upon which he experimented, he 
referred with a cold indifference not skill- 
fully concealed behind a perfunctory show of 
sympathy. He swore that he did not know 
the dog was stolen. He swore that he was 
about to anaesthetize the dog. He swore that 
none of his subjects suffered. He swore that 
beyond a passing discomfort animals did not 
suffer. 

Philip Surbridge, up to this point, had 
handled the college witnesses with a courtesy 
that was almost cordial, cutting swathes in 
the defense with a nonchalant touch. He had 
begun pleasantly and lightly as if he were 
trundling a lawn-mower. Now the stone- 
crusher bewail to move. In five minutes Dr. 
Charles Claudius Bernard was uncomfortable. 
In ten, his cruel, deeply reddened face had 
taken on purplish shadows about the mouth 
and eyes. In fifteen, he had admitted half a 
dozen things which he had begun by denying, 
and in twenty, if a stone-crusher had been 
vivisectible material he could have flayed 
the brain and heart of the counsel for the 
prosecution. 

The judge, who had been listening to the 



 

cross-examination with an absorbed attention 
not expected of a police-court magistrate, now 
interrupted the natural order of the proceed- 
ings. He expressed a wish to have the 
plaintiff put upon the stand. Was it a slip 
of the tongue ? or was his Honor pleased to 
be facetious? Surbridge paused in evident 
perplexity, and made a motion towards Dan. 

" I think I fail to understand your Honor's 
wish?" 

" Produce the real complainant," said the 
judge peremptorily. " I want to see the dog." 

" Go, Dan," said Philip Surbridge in a low 
voice — "or — no — stay where you are. I 'll 
do it." 

He went over himself and took the dog from 
Miss Lauriat so quietly that only a few persons 
sitting nearest the young lady knew precisely 
what had occurred. For the instant Miriam 
lifted the dark veil that was tied about her 
hat, and her eyes went to Philip's straight. 
They had a beautiful look, half of wonder, 
half of pride, and all of trust. They said : 
" You are making a grand case of it. And 
yet you are sparing me." 

Trixy obeyed his Honor's summons very 



 

prettily. She was of the race and of the sex 
that offer the trick dogs, and was prepared 
to regard the occasion as a professional oppor- 
tunity. Yet she paid no attention at first to 
anything but her master ; to whom she flew 
— more like a bird than a dog — with little 
squeals of delight and dainty laps of her rose- 
pink tongue, cuddling and protesting passion- 
ately against the separation of the day ; she 
laid her cheek rapturously to the radiance of 
Dan's face, and, turning her head and neck 
gracefully, she brought these close beneath 
his chin, and from this shelter serenely sur- 
veyed the court. 

It then occurred to her that she was neg- 
lecting one of the dearest of friends, and she 
sprang from Dan's arms to Surbridge's at a 
bound. Philip gently put her down upon the 
table, where the opposing counsel, whether of 
accident or of intent, stroked Trixy. The 
court smiled and said : 

" A point has been raised about the un- 
usual character or value of the dog. I should 
like to see one or two of the little creature's 
accomplishments." 

Dan stepped forward proudly, and, being 



 

something muddled by excitement, hastily 
began : 

" Trixy, where is the lady you love the best?" 

" No, no ! " whispered Surbridge. " Not 
that ! Not now ! Trixy should shake hands 
with the judge." 

So Trixy, being lifted up, shook hands with 
his Honor — very charmingly indeed. Then 
she volunteered to kiss Mr. Surbridge, but, 
being deftly dissuaded, boxed the ears of the 
opposing counsel instead. Then she danced a 
two-step on the table, and bowed with dig- 
nity to the audience. After that, she leaped 
the bounds of all legal precedent, and, lightly 
springing to his Honor's lap, put her paws on 
the bench, her head on her paws, and said 
her prayers. 

The audience was now laughing heartily, 
and the judge, finding that Trixy, considered 
in the form of evidence, was more than he 
had counted on, handed her back to her 
counsel, and returned severely to his official 
duties. Somewhat testily he demanded that 
the defendant be recalled, and the unexpected 
question was shot at Bernard : 

" Do you recognize this dog ? " 



 

So Dr. C. C. Bernard put on his distance 
glasses, carefully examined the little creature, 
and slowly said : 

" I see so many subjects ! There are so 
many experiments ! I could hardly be ex- 
pected to identify any one of them outside 
the laboratory." 

" Answer Yes or No ! " thundered Sur- 
bridge. "Do you recognize this dog?" 

Then Charles Claudius Bernard answered : 

" I do not recognize the dog." 

Now as the strident accents of this reply 
grated upon the silent court-room, a remark- 
able change fell upon the " real complainant." 
Trixy, who had run to the end of her leash 
upon the table, pleasantly regarding the au- 
dience which she plainly supposed to have 
assembled in her honor, turned with a motion 
of unmistakable fear, and looked up into Dr. 
Bernard's dark, disturbed face. Over that of 
the dog crept such an expression of horror 
that his Honor instinctively uttered a click- 
ing noise, made by hitting the tongue against 
the roof of the mouth. Several persons sit- 
ting near enough to see the dog's eyes gave 
out low exclamations. Whether Dr. Bernard 




recognized the subject or not, the subject had 
recognized Dr. Bernard. Cringing with fright, 
Trixy fled to her master and buried herself in 
his arms and in his neck. This shelter not suf- 
ficing, she burrowed beneath his coat and hid 
herself from sight. Dan could hear the terri- 
lied beating of her little heart, and the arm 
with which he clasped her stirred with the 
violent trembling of the dog's delicate body. 
This unusual court episode created an obvious 
impression, and it began to be suspected that 
Trixy was likely to win her own case. 

The stone-crusher ground on, more briskly 
now, with swifter revolutions. 

" Did you ever see this before?" cried Sur- 
bridge, sharply wheeling upon a scowling wit- 
ness known to the students as "janitor's boy." 
The attorney held out in both hands a dog's 
blue blanket, soiled and spoiled and torn, on 
which the embroidered letters I X Y were still 
plainly to be seen. 

The witness, stammering and trembling, 
said he had seen the blanket before, at the 
college — on a dog — on this dog, yes, sir. 
He had put it in the ash barrel. Yes, sir, it 
was the janitor told him to. 




" You were familiar with the appearance of 
this blanket, of course ? You must have been 
aware of the existence of the embroidered let- 
ters I X Y upon it?" 

The witness granted that he was familiar 
with the appearance of the blanket, and that 
he had noticed the embroidered letters I X Y. 

" And then this" suggested Surbridge care- 
lessly. " You must have observed this writing 
on the inside of the blanket ? " 

He turned the little blanket wrong side 
out, and, held up in full view of the court, 
it showed the legend printed in indelible ink 
upon a piece of linen that was sewed under- 
neath Trixy's coat: 

This belongs to Trixy Badger. She is a little white 
dog. She belongs to Daniel E. Badger, 123 Blind Alley. 
If lost, please return her. 

Under a terrible cross-examination the wit- 
ness, sweating agony and crying mercy from 
every pore of body and soul, admitted that 
he had seen the label — thought he had men- 
tioned the label to the janitor — thought that 
Dr. Bernard knew about the coat, but darsen't 
tell why he thought so. 

The janitor's boy panted and shook so that 



 

Surbridge, in scornful mercy, released him be- 
fore he meant to. 

" The case is won," said the elderly law- 
yer who had known Surbridge's father in his 
prime. "But they will appeal." 

The closing arguments were tense and short ; 
that of the defense being remarkably able, 
and as impressive as it could well be made in 
teeth of developments so dramatic and so un- 
expected. 

Philip Surbridge occupied less than half an 
hour. He reviewed the evidence briefly, almost 
brusquely, as if it were idle to waste the time 
of the court by dwelling upon such a fortifi- 
cation of facts. His manner was cheerful and 
assured, and seemed to intrust the case to the 
legal sense of the judge, as a matter of course. 
It was without a trace of " lawyer's worry " 
that he rose into the impassioned and original 
plea which was long and well remembered by 
every attorney in the room. Some applauded 
it, some criticised it, but no man forgot it. 

Surbridge, having handled the technicali- 
ties of his case with significant thoroughness 
and with real power, now gave himself over 
generously to its moral and even its emotional 



 

aspects. The manner in which he was pleased 
to do this, though not without a counterpart 
in the records of the Bar, I was unmatched in 
the courts of our Eastern coast. Without a 
word of apology for the innovation, the lame 
lad's counsel launched upon a eulogy of the 
nature of the dog. 

"A man does not have to live very long," 
he said, " to discover that in this world friends 
are hard to gain, and harder to keep. At 
most they are very few. Not many of them 
are true. All of them are uncertain. None of 
them can answer the demands of our clamor- 
ing hearts. Who comes so near to meeting 
the conditions of a real friendship as your 
dog? His devotion surpasses the devotion of 
most women. His affection outvies the affec- 
tion of any man. He gives everything ; he 
asks nothing. He offers all ; he receives little. 
He comforts your loneliness ; he assuages your 
distress; he sacrifices his liberty to watch by 
you in sickness ; when every one else who 
used to love you has neglected your grave, he 
will break his heart upon it. Who fails you 
in faith ? Your dog is loyal. Who deserts

you ? Your dog never. Who gashes you with 
roughness, or bruises you with unkindness ? 
Your dog offers you the tenderness that time 
and use cannot destroy. You have from him 
the expression of the uttermost, the unselfish 
love. This little citizen of the slums, this 
wronged and suffering lad possessed a trea- 
sure which any one of us might envy — the 
true friendship of an exquisite canine nature. 
Without excuse in the nature of the deed, 
without apology in the laws of the land, sci- 
ence put out her red hand and tore from 
this afflicted boy his means of livelihood, the 
joy of his hard life, the comrade of his deso- 
lation. His tragic experience is one of hun- 
dreds that never reach the knowledge of the 
public, or the protection of the courts. The 
merciful denouement of this dark tale does 
not often await the bereaved household that 
has mysteriously lost its dumb and cherished 
friend. Yours may be such a household. 
Mine might be such bereavement. We, too, 
may be elected to share this fate into which 
the physiology of our day drags the animal 
and the human too. Y^ou have heard the de- 
fendant in this case assert that he does not 



 

know, that his institution does not know, 
where the victims of his laboratory come from. 
Your Honor ! I claim that his institution 
ought to know. I say that her faculty and 
her employees ought to know. I urge that 
the defendants should be made to know — 
by the decision of this court — where this 
material came from, and that they should 
never be permitted from this hour to forget. 
I appeal for this wronged boy against the 
slaughter-houses of science, to the law which 
is framed to protect the weak, to punish 
outrage, and to respect the sacredness of 
property." 

It seemed that Surbridge had intended to 
say something more, but, checked by his own 
agitation, and moved by the emotion in the 
court-room, he ceased abruptly. His pale face 
turned impulsively towards the girl in the far 
end of the house. It seemed to him that he 
could see her wet eyes through her veil. 

Quickly and quietly she rose and went out. 
It was as though she could not trust herself 
to witness the end of the scene. 

This came now, in a whirlwind. 

His Honor summed up briefly and sternly. 



 

He referred to the importance of this case to 
the community — to its unusual character — 
to the standing- of the defendants — to their 
evident assumption that their influential posi- 
tion would afford them immunity. The court, 
however, proposed to dispense justice impar- 
tially, regardless of the consequences. Science
