" I dare you ! " he exclaimed. 

" I'm ready," said Hal. 

" You mean it ? " 

" Of course I mean it." 

" In that costume ? " 

" Certainly. I'm one of his miners." 

" But it won't go," cried the reporter. " You'll stand 
no chance to get near him unless you're well dressed." 

"Are you sure of that? What I've got on might 
be the garb of a railroad-hand. Suppose there was some- 
thing out of order in one of the cars — the plumbing, for 
example ? " 

" But you couldn't fool the conductor or the porter." 

" I might be able to. Let's try it." 

There was a pause, while Keating thought. " The 
truth is," he said, " it doesn't matter whether you succeed 
or not — it's a story if you even make the attempt. The 
Coal King's son appealed to by one of his serfs! The 
hard heart of Plutocracy rejects the cry of Labour ! " 

"Yes," said Hal, "but I really mean to get to him. 
Do you suppose he's got back to the train yet ? " 

" They were starting to it when I left." 

" And where is the train ? " 

" Two or three hundred yards east of the station, I was 

told." 

MacKellar and Edstrom had been listening enthralled 
to this exciting conversation. " That ought to be just back 
of my house," said the former. 



 

" It's a short train — four parlour-cars and a baggage- 
car ' added Keating. "It ought to be easy to recog- 
nise." 

The old Scotchman put in an objection. " The diffi- 
culty may be to get out of this house. I don't believe they 
mean to let you get away to-night." 

" By Jove, that's so ! " exclaimed Keating. " We're 
talking too much — let's get busy. Are they watching the 
back door, do you suppose ? " 

" They've been watching it all day," said MacKellar. 

" Listen," broke in Hal — " I've an idea. They haven't 
tried to interfere with your going out, have they, Mr. Keat- 
ing?" 

" No, not yet." 

" Nor with you, Mr. MacKellar ? " 

" No, not yet," said the Scotchman. 

"Well," Hal suggested, "suppose you lend me your 
crutches ? " 

Whereat Keating gave an exclamation of delight. 
"The very thing!" 

" I'll take your over-coat and hat," Hal added. " I've 
watched you get about, and I think I can give an imita- 
tion. As for Mr. Keating, he's not easy to mistake." 

" Billy, the fat boy ! " laughed the other. " Come, let's 
get on the job ! " 

" I'll go out by the front door at the same time," put in 
Edstrom, his old voice trembling with excitement. " May- 
be that'll help to throw them off the track." 



 They had been sitting upstairs in MacKellar's 
room. Now they rose, and were starting for the stairs, 
when suddenly there came a ring at the front door bell. 
They stopped and stared at one another. "There they 
are ! " whispered Keating. 



 

And MacKellar sat down suddenly, and held out his 
crutches to Hal. " The hat and coat are in the front 
hall," he exclaimed. " Make a try for it ! " His words 
were full of vigour, but like Edstrom, his voice was 
trembling. He was no longer young, and could not take 
adventure gaily. 

Hal and Keating ran downstairs, followed by Edstrom. 
Hal put on the coat and hat, and they went to the back 
door, while at the same time Edstrom answered the bell in 
front. 

The back door opened into a yard, and this gave, through 
a side gate, into an alley. Hal's heart was pounding furi- 
ously as he began to hobble along with the crutches. He 
had to go at MacKellar's slow pace — while Keating, at 
his side, started talking. He informed " Mr. MacKel- 
lar," in a casual voice, that the Gazette was a newspaper 
which believed in the people's cause, and was pledged to 
publish the people's side of all public questions. Dis- 
coursing thus, they went out of the gate and into the 
alley. 

A man emerged from the shadows and walked by them. 
He passed within three feet of Hal, and peered at him, 
narrowly. Fortunately there was no moon; Hal could 
not see the man's face, and hoped the man could not see 
his. 

Meantime Keating was proceeding with his discourse. 
" You understand, Mr. MacKellar," he was saying, 
" sometimes it's difficult to find out the truth in a situa- 
tion like this. When the interests are filling their news- 
papers with falsehoods and exaggerations, it's a tempta- 
tion for us to publish falsehoods and exaggerations on the 
other side. But we find in the long run that it pays best to 
publish the truth, Mr. MacKellar — we can stand by it, 
and there's no come-back." 

Hal, it must be admitted, was not paying much atten- 
tion to this edifying sermon. He was looking ahead, to 



 

where the alley debouched onto the street. It was the 
street behind MacKellar's house, and only a block from the 
railroad-track. 

He dared not look behind, but he was straining his ears. 
Suddenly he heard a shout, in John Edstrom's voice. 
"Eun! Eun!" 

In a flash, Hal dropped the two crutches, and started 
down the alley, Keating at his heels. They heard cries 
behind them, and a voice, sounding quite near, com- 
manded, " Halt ! " They had reached the end of the 
alley, and were in the act of swerving, when a shot 
rang out and there was a crash of glass in a house beyond 
them on the far side of the street. 

Farther on was a vacant lot with a path running across 
it. Following this, they dodged behind some shanties, 
and came to another street — and so to the railroad 
tracks. There was a long line of freight-cars before them, 
and they ran between two of these, and climbing over the 
couplings, saw a great engine standing, its headlight gleam- 
ing full in their eyes. They sprang in front of it, and 
alongside the train, passing a tender, then a baggage-car,^ . 
then a parlour-car. 

" Here we are ! " exclaimed Keating, who was puffing 
like a bellows. 

Hal saw that there were only three more cars to the 
train ; also, he saw a man in a blue uniform standing at 
the steps. He dashed towards him. u Your car's on 
fire ! " he cried. 

" What ? " exclaimed the man. " Where ? " 

" Here ! " cried Hal ; and in a flash he had sprung past 
the other, up the steps and into the car. 

There was a long, narrow corridor, to be recognised as 
the kitchen portion of a dining-car; at the other end of 
this corridor was a swinging door, and to this Hal leaped. 
He heard the conductor shouting to him to stop, but he 
paid no heed. He slipped off his over-coat and hat ; and 



 

then, pushing open the door, he entered a brightly lighted 
apartment — and the presence of the Coal King's son. 



 White linen and cut glass of the dining-saloon 
shone brilliantly under electric lights, softened to the eye 
by pink shades. Seated at the tables were half a dozen 
young men and as many young ladies, all in evening cos- 
tume; also two or three older ladies. They had begun 
the first course of their meal, and were laughing and chat- 
ting, when suddenly came this unexpected visitor, clad in 
coal-stained miner's jumpers. He was not disturbing in 
the manner of his entry; but immediately behind him came 
a fat man, perspiring, wild of aspect, and wheezing like 
an old fashioned steam-engine ; behind him came the con- 
ductor of the train, in a no less evident state of agita- 
tion. So, of course, conversation ceased. The young 
ladies turned in their chairs, while several of the young 
men sprang to their feet. 

There followed a silence : until finally one of the young 
men took a step forward. " What's this ? " he demanded, 
as one who had a right to demand. 

Hal advanced towards the speaker, a slender youth, 
correct in appearance, but not distinguished looking. 
"Hello, Percy! "said Hal. 

A look of amazement came upon the other's face. He 
stared, but seemed unable to believe what he saw. And 
then suddenly came a cry from one of the young ladies ; 
the one having hair the colour of molasses taffy when 
you've pulled it — but all fluffy and wonderful, with star- 
dust in it. Her cheeks were pink and cream, and her 
brown eyes gazed, wide open, full of wonder. She wore a 
dinner gown of soft olive green, with a cream white scarf 
of some filmy material thrown about her bare shoulders. 

She had started to her feet. " It's Hal ! " she cried. 



 


" Hal Warner ! " echoed young Harrigan. " Why, 
what in the world — ? " 

He was interrupted by a clamour outside. "Wait a 
moment ' said Hal, quietly. " I think some one else is 
coming in." 

* The door was pushed violently open. It was pushed so 
violently that Billy Keating and the conductor were 
thrust to one side; and Jeff Cotton appeared in the en- 
trance. 

The camp-marshal was breathless, his face full of the 
passion of the hunt. In his rigfct hand he carried a re- 
volver. He glared about him, and saw the two men he 
was chasing ; also he saw the Coal King's son, and the rest 
of the astonished company. He stood, stricken dumb. 

The door was pushed again, forcing him aside, and two 
more men crowded in, both of them carrying revolvers in 
their hands. The foremost was Pete Hanun, and he also 
stood staring. The " breaker of teeth " had two teeth of 
his own missing, and when his prize-fighter's jaw dropped 
down, the deficiency became conspicuous. It was proba- 
bly his first entrance into society, and he was like an over- 
grown boy caught in the jam-closet. 

Percy Harrigan's manner became distinctly imperious. 
" What does this mean ? " he demanded. 

It was Hal who answered. " I am seeking a crimi- 
nal, Percy." 

" What ? " There were little cries of alarm from the 
women. 

" Yes, a criminal ; the man who sealed up the mine." 

" Sealed up the mine ? " echoed the other. " What do 
you mean ? " 

a Let me explain. First, I will introduce my friends. 
Harrigan, this is my friend Keating." 

Billy suddenly realised that he had a hat on his head. 
He jerked it off ; but for the rest, his social instincts failed 




 

him. He could only stare. He had not yet got all his 
breath. 

"Billy's a reporter," said Hal. "But you needn't 
worry — he's a gentleman, and won't betray a confidence. 
You understand, Billy." 

" Y — yes," said Billy, faintly. 

" And this," said Hal, " is Jeff Cotton, camp-marshal at 
North Valley. I suppose you know, Percy, that the 
North Valley mines belong to the ' G. F. C . Cotton, this 
is Mr. Harrigan." 

Then Cotton remembered his hat; also his revolver, 
which he tried to get out of sight behind his back. 

" And this," continued Hal, " is Mr. Pete Hanun, by 
profession a breaker of teeth. This other gentleman, 
whose name I don't know, is presumably an assistant- 
breaker." So Hal went on, observing the forms of social 
intercourse, his purpose being to give his mind a chance 
to work. So much depended upon the tactics he chose in 
this emergency! Should he take Percy to one side and 
tell him the story quietly, leaving it to his sense of jus- 
tice and humanity? No, that was not the way one dealt 
with the Harrigans ! They had bullied their way to the 
front; if anything were done with them, it would be by 
force ! If anything were done with Percy, it would be by 
laying hold of him before these guests, exposing the situa- 
tion, and using their feelings to coerce him! 

The Coal King's son was asking questions again. 
What was all this about? So Hal began to describe the 
condition of the men inside the mine. " They have no 
food or water, except what they had in their dinner-pails ; 
and it's been three days and a half since the explosion! 
They are breathing bad air; their heads are aching, the 
veins swelling in their foreheads ; their tongues are crack- 
ing, they are lying on the ground, gasping. But they are 
waiting — kept alive by the faith they have in their friends 



 

on the surface, who will try to get to them. They dare 
not take down the barriers, because the gases would kill 
them at once. But they know the rescuers will come, so 
they listen for the sounds of axes and picks. That is the 
situation." 

Hal stopped and waited for some sign of concern from 
young Harrigan. But no such sign was given. Hal 
went on: 

" Think of it, Percy ! There is one old man in that 
mine, an Irishman who has a wife and eight children wait- 
ing to learn about his fate. I know one woman who has 
a husband and three sons in the mine. For three days and 
a half the women and children have been standing at the 
pit-mouth ; I have seen them sitting with their heads sunk 
upon their knees, or shaking their fists, screaming curses 
at the criminal who is to blame." 

There was a pause. " The criminal ? " inquired 
young Harrigan. " I don't understand ! " 

" You'll hardly be able to believe it ; but nothing has 
been done to rescue these men. The criminal has nailed 
a cover of boards over the pit-mouth, and put tarpaulin 
over it — sealing up men and boys to die ! " 

There was a murmur of horror from the diners. 

" I know, you can't conceive such a thing. The reason 
is, there's a fire in the mine ; if the fan is set to working, 
the coal will burn. But at the same time, some of the 
passages could be got clear of smoke, and some of the men 
could be rescued. So it's a question of property against 
lives; and the criminal has decided for the property. He 
proposes to wait a week, two weeks, until the fire has been 
smothered ; then of course the men and boys will be dead." 

There was a silence. It was broken by young Harri- 
gan. " Who has done this ? " 

" His name is Enos Cartwright." 

« But who is he ? " 

" Just now when I said that I was seeking the crimi- 



 

nal, I misled you a little, Percy. I did it because I 
wanted to collect my thoughts." Hal paused : when he con- 
tinued, his voice was sharper, his sentences falling like 
blows. " The criminal I've been telling you about is the 
superintendent of the mine — a man employed and put in 
authority by the General Fuel Company. The one who is 
being chased is not the one who sealed up the mine, but the 
one who proposed to have it opened. He is being treated 
as a malefactor, because the laws of the state, as well as 
the laws of humanity, have been suppressed by the Gen- 
eral Fuel Company ; he was forced to seek refuge in your 
car, in order to save his life from thugs and gunmen in the 
company's employ ! " 



 Knowing these people well, Hal could measure 
the effect of the thunderbolt he had hurled among them. 
They were people to whom good taste was the first of all 
the Virtues; he knew how hi was offending them. If he 
was to win them to the least extent, he must explain his 
presence here — a trespasser upon the property of the 
Harrigans. 

" Percy," he continued, " you remember how you used 
to jump on me last year at college, because I listened to 
'muck-rakers.' You saw fit to take personal offence at 
it. You knew that their tales couldn't be true. But I 
wanted to see for myself, so I went to work in a coal- 
mine. I saw the explosion; I saw this man, Jeff Cot- 
ton, driving women and children away from the pit-mouth 
with blows and curses. I set out to help the men in the 
mine, and the marshal rushed me out of camp. He told 
me that if I didn't go about my business, something would 
happen to me on a dark night. And you see — this is a 
dark night ! " 



 

Hal waited, to give young Harrigan a chance to grasp 
this situation and to take command. But apparently 
young Harrigan was not aware of the presence of the camp- 
marshal and his revolver. Hal tried again : 

" Evidently these men wouldn't have minded killing 
me ; they fired at me just now. The marshal still has the 
revolver and you can smell the powder-smoke. So I took 
the liberty of entering your car, Percy. It was to save 
my life, and you'll have to excuse me." 

The Coal King's son had here a sudden opportunity to 
be magnanimous. He made haste to avail himself of it. 
" Of course, Hal," he said. " It was quite all right to 
come here. If our employes were behaving in such fash- 
ion, it was without authority, and they will surely pay for 
it." He spoke with quiet certainty; it was the Harrigan 
manner, and before it Jeff Cotton and the two mine-guards 
seemed to wither and shrink. 

" Thank you, Percy," said Hal. " It's what I knew 
you'd say. I'm sorry to have disturbed your dinner- 
party — " 

" Not at all, Hal ; it was nothing of a party." 

" You see, Percy, it was not only to save myself, but 
the people in the mine ! They are dying, and every mo- 
ment is precious. It will take a day at least to get to 
them, so they'll be at their last gasp. Whatever's to be 
done must be done at once." 

Again Hal waited — until the pause became awkward. 
The diners had so far been looking at him; but now 
they were looking at young Harrigan, and young Harrigan 
felt the change. 

" I don't know just what you expect of me, Hal. My 
father employs competent men to manage his business, and 
I certainly don't feel that I know enough to give them any 
suggestions." This again in the Harrigan manner; but 
it weakened before Hal's firm gaze. " What can I do ? " 

" You can give the order to open the mine, to reverse the 



 

fan and start it. That will draw out the smoke and gases, 
and the rescuers can go down." 

"But Hal, I assure you I have no authority to give 
such an order." 

" You must take the authority. Your father's in the 
East, the officers of the company are in their beds at 
home ; you are here ! " 

"But I don't understand such things, Hal! I don't 
know anything of the situation — except what you tell me. 
And while I don't doubt your word, any man may make 
a mistake in such a situation." 

" Come and see for yourself, Percy ! That's all I ask, 
and it's easy enough. Here is your train, your engine 
with steam up; have us switched onto the North Valley 
branch, and we can be at the mine in half an hour. Then 

— let me take you to the men who know ! Men who've 
been working all their lives in mines, who've seen acci- 
dents like this many times, and who will tell you the truth 

— that there's a chance of saving many lives, and that the 
chance is being thrown away to save some thousands of 
dollars' worth of coal and timbers and track." 

u But even if that's true, Hal, I have no 'power I " 

" If you come there, you can cut the red-tape in one 
minute. What those bosses are doing is a thing that can 
only be done in darkness ! " 

Under the pressure of Hal's vehemence, the Harrigan 
manner was failing; the Coal King's son was becoming 
a bewildered and quite ordinary youth. But there was a 
power greater than Hal behind him. He shook his head. 
" It's the old man's business, Hal. I've no right to butt 
in!" 

The other, in his desperate need, turned to the rest 
of the party. His gaze, moving from one face to an- 
other, rested upon the mazagine-cover countenance, with 
the brown eyes wide open, full of wonder. 

" Jessie ! What do you think about it    " 



 

The girl started, and distress leaped into her face. 
" How do you mean, Hal ? " 

" Tell him he ought to save those lives ! " 

The moments seemed ages as Hal waited. It was a 
test, he realised. The brown eyes dropped. " I don't 
understand such things, Hal ! " 

" But, Jessie, I am explaining them ! Here are men 
and boys being suffocated to death, in order to save a little 
money. Isn't that plain ? " 

" But how can I know, Hal ? " 

" I'm giving you my word, Jessie. Surely I wouldn't 
appeal to you unless I knew." 

Still she hesitated. And there came a swift note of 
feeling into his voice : " Jessie, dear ! " 

As if under a spell, the girl's eyes were raised to his; 
he saw a scarlet flame of embarrassment spreading over her 
throat and cheeks. " Jessie, I know — it seems an intolera- 
ble thing to ask! You've never been rude to a friend. 
But I remember once you forgot your good manners, when 
you saw a rough fellow on the street beating an old drudge- 
horse. Don't you remember how you rushed at him — 
like a wild thing ! And now — think of it, dear, here are 
old drudge-creatures being tortured to death; but not 
horses — working-men ! " 

Still the girl gazed at him. He could read grief, dis- 
may in her eyes ; he saw tears steal from them, and stream 
down her cheeks. "Oh, I don't know, I don't know!" 
she cried ; and hid her face in her hands, and began to sob 
aloud. 



§ li. There was a painful pause. Hal's gaze travelled 
on, and came to a grey-haired lady in a black dinner 
gown, with a rope of pearls about her neck. " Mrs. Cur- 
tis ! Surely you will advise him ! " 

The grey-haired lady started — was there no limit to his 



 

impudence? She had witnessed the torturing of Jessie. 
But Jessie was his fiancee; he had no such claim upon Mrs. 
Curtis. She answered, with iciness in her tone: "I 
could not undertake to dictate to my host in such a mat- 
ter." 

"Mrs. Curtis! You have founded a charity for the 
helping of stray cats and dogs ! " These words rose to 
Hal's lips ; but he did not say them. His eyes moved on. 
Who else might help to bully a Harrigan ? 

Next to Mrs. Curtis sat Reggie Porter, with a rose in 
the button-hole of his dinner-jacket. Hal knew the role 
in which Reggie was there — a kind of male chaperon, 
an assistant host, an admirer to the wealthy, a solace to 
the bored. Poor Reggie lived other people's lives, his soul 
perpetually a-quiver with other people's excitements, with 
gossip, preparations for tea-parties, praise of tea-parties 
past. And always the soul was pushing; calculating, 
measuring opportunities, making up in tact and elegance 
for distressing lack of money. Hal got one swift glimpse 
of the face; the sharp little black moustaches seemed 
standing up with excitement, and in a flash of horrible in- 
tuition Hal read the situation — Reggie was expecting 
to be questioned, and had got ready an answer that would 
increase his social capital in the Harrigan family bank! 

Across the aisle sat Genevieve Halsey : tall, erect, built 
on the scale of a statue. You thought of the ox-eyed 
Juno, and imagined stately emotions ; but when you came 
to know Genevieve, you discovered that her mind was slow, 
and entirely occupied with herself. Next to her was 
Bob Creston, smooth-shaven, rosy-cheeked, exuding well- 
being — what is called a " good fellow," with a wholesome 
ambition to win cups for his athletic club, and to keep up 
the score of his rifle-team of. the state militia. Jolly Bob 
might have spoken, out of his good heart ; but he was in 
love with a cousin of Percy's, Betty Gunnison, who sat 
across the table from him — and Hal saw her black eyes 



 

shining, her little fists clenched tightly, her lips pressed 
white. Hal understood Betty — she was one of the Har- 
rigans, working at the Harrigan family task of making the 
children of a pack-pedlar into leaders in the "younger 
set " ! 

Next sat " Vivie " Cass, whose talk was of horses and 
dogs and such ungirlish matters ; Hal had discussed social 
questions in her presence, and heard her view expressed in 
one flashing sentence — " If a man eats with his knife, I 
consider him my personal enemy ! " Over her shoulder 
peered the face of a man with pale eyes and yellow mous- 
taches — Bert Atkins, cynical and world-weary, whom the 
papers referred to as a "club-man," and whom Hal's 
brother had called a " tame cat." There was " Dicky " 
Everson, like Hal, a favourite of the ladies, but nothing 
more ; " Billy " Harris, son of another " coal man " ; 
Daisy, his sister; and Blanche Vagleman, whose father 
was Old Peter's head lawyer, whose brother was the local 
counsel, and publisher of the Pedro Star. 

So Hal's eyes moved from face to face, and his mind 
from personality to personality. It was like the unrolling 
of a scroll ; a panorama of a world he had half forgotten. 
He had no time for reflection, but one impression came to 
him, swift and overwhelming. Once he had lived in this 
world and taken it as a matter of course. He had known 
these people, gone about with them; they had seemed 
friendly, obliging, a good sort of people on the whole. 
And now, what a change! They seemed no longer 
friendly ! Was the change in them ? Or was it Hal who 
had become cynical — so that he saw them in this terri- 
fying new light, cold, and unconcerned as the stars about 
men who were dying a few miles away ! 

Hal's eyes came back to the Coal King's son, and he 
discovered that Percy was white with anger. " I assure 
you, Hal, there's no use going on with this. I have no 
intention of letting myself be bulldozed." 



 

Percy's gaze shifted with sudden purpose to the 
camp-marshal. " Cotton, what do you say about this ? 
Is Mr. Warner correct in his idea of the situation ? " 

" You know what such a man would say, Percy ! " 
broke in Hal. 

" I don't," was the reply. " I wish to know. What 
is it, Cotton ? " 

" He's mistaken, Mr. Harrigan." The marshal's voice 
was sharp and defiant. 

" In what way ? " 

" The company's doing everything to get the mine 
open, and has been from the beginning." 

" Oh ! " And there was triumph in Percy's voice. 
" What is the cause of the delay ? " 

" The fan was broken, and we had to send for a new 
one. It's a job to set it up — such things can't be done in 
an hour." 

Percy turned to Hal. "You see! There are two 
opinions, at least ! " 

" Of course ! " cried Betty Gunnison, her black eyes 
snapping at Hal. She would have said more, but Hal in- 
terrupted, stepping closer to his host. " Percy," he said, 
in a low voice, " come back here, please. I have a word 
to say to you alone." 

There was just a hint of menace in Hal's voice; his 
gaze went to the far end of the car, a space occupied only 
by two negro waiters. These retired in haste as the young 
men moved towards them ; and so, having the Coal King's 
son to himself, Hal went in to finish this fight. 



 Percy Harrigan was known to Hal, as a college- 
boy is known to his class-mates. He was not brutal, like 
his grim old father ; he was merely self-indulgent, as one 
who had always had everything ; he was weak, as one who 
had never had to take a bold resolve. He had been brought 



 

up by the women of the family, to be a part of what they 
called " society " ; in which process he had been given high 
notions of his own importance. The life of the Harri- 
gans was dominated by one painful memory — that of a 
pedlar's pack; and Hal knew that Percy's most urgent 
purpose was to be regarded as a real and true and free- 
handed aristocrat. It was this knowledge Hal was using 
in his attack. 

He began with apologies, attempting to soothe the other's 
anger. He had not meant to make a scene like this; it 
was the gunmen who had forced it, putting his life in 
danger. It was the very devil, being chased about at 
night and shot at! He had lost his nerve, really; he 
had forgot what little manners he had been able to keep 
as a miner's buddy. He had mad© a spectacle of himself ; 
good Lord yes, he realised how he must seem ! 

— And Hal looked at his dirty miner's jumpers, and 
then at Percy. He could see that Percy was in hearty 
agreement thus far — he had indeed made a spectacle of 
himself, and of Percy too ! Hal was sorry about this lat- 
ter, but here they were, in a pickle, and it was certainly too 
late now. This story was out — there could be no sup- 
pressing it ! Hal might sit down on his reporter-friend, 
Percy might sit down on the waiters and the con- 
ductor and the camp-marshal and the gunmen — but he 
could not possibly sit down on all his friends! They 
would talk about nothing else for weeks ! The story would 
be all over Western City in a day — this amazing, melo- 
dramatic, ten-twenty-thirty story of a miner's buddy in the 
private car of the Coal King's son ! 

" And you must see, Percy," Hal went on, " it's the sort 
of thing that sticks to a man. It's the thing by which 
everybody will form their idea of you as long as you live ! " 

" I'll take my chances with my friends' criticism," said 
the other, with some attempt at the Harrigan manner. 

"You can make it whichever kind of story you choose," 



 

continued Hal, implacably. " The world will say, He de- 
cided for the dollars; or it will say, He decided for the 
lives. Surely, Percy, your family doesn't need those par- 
ticular dollars so badly ! Why, you've spent more on this 
one train-trip ! " 

And Hal waited, to give his victim time to calculate. 

The result of the thinking was a question worthy of Old 
Peter. " What are you getting out of this ? " 

" Percy," said Hal, " you must know I'm getting noth- 
ing ! If you can't understand it otherwise, say to yourself 
that you are dealing with a man who's irresponsible. I've 
seen so many terrible things — I've been chased around so 
much by camp-marshals — why, Percy, that man Cotton 
has six notches on his gun ! I'm simply crazy ! " And 
into the brown eyes of this miner's buddy came a look wild 
enough to convince a stronger man than Percy Harrigan. 
" I've got just one idea left in the world, Percy — to save 
those miners ! You make a mistake unless you realise how 
desperate I am. So far I've done this thing incog ! I've 
been Joe Smith, a miner's buddy. If I'd come out and 
told my real name — well, maybe I wouldn't have made 
them open the mine, but at least I'd have made a lot of 
trouble for the G. P. C. ! But I didn't do it ; I knew what 
a scandal it would make, and there was something I owed 
my father. But if I see there's no other way, if it's a 
question of letting those people perish, I'll throw every- 
thing else to the winds. Tell your father that ; tell him I 
threatened to turn this man Keating loose and blow the 
thing wide open — denounce the company, appeal to the 
Governor, raise a disturbance and get arrested on the 
street, if necessary, in order to force the facts before the 
public. You see, I've got the facts, Percy! I've been 
there and seen with my own eyes. Can't you realise 
that ? " 

The other did not answer, but it was evident that he 
realised. 



 

"On the other hand, see how you can fix it, if you 
choose. You were on a pleasure trip when you heard of 
this disaster; you rushed up and took command, you 
opened the mine, you saved the lives of your employes. 
That is the way the papers will handle it." 

Hal, watching his victim intently, and groping for the 
path to his mind, perceived that he had gone wrong. 
Crude as the Harrigans were, they had learned that it is 
not aristocratic to be picturesque. 

" All right then ! " said Hal, quickly. " If you prefer, 
you needn't be mentioned. The bosses up at the camp 
have the reporters under their thumbs, they'll handle the 
story any way you want it. The one thing I care about is 
that you run your car up and see the mine opened. Won't 
you do it, Percy ? " 

Hal was gazing into the other's eyes, knowing that life 
and death for the miners hung upon his nod. " Well ? 
What is the answer ? " 

"Hal," exclaimed Percy, "my old man will give me 
hell ! " 

" All right ; but on the other hand, I'll give you hell ; 
and which will be worse ? " 

Again there was a silence. " Come along, Percy ! For 
God's sake ! " And Hal's tone was desperate, alarming. 

And suddenly the other gave way. "All right! " 

Hal drew a breath. " But mind you ! " he added. 
" You're not going up there to let them fool you ! They'll 
try to bluff you out — they may go as far as to refuse to 
obey you. But you must stand by your guns — for, you 
see, I'm going along, I'm going to see that mine open. 
I'll never quit till the rescuers have gone down ! " 

" Will they go, Hal ? " 

"Will they go? Good God, man, they're clamouring 
for the chance to go ! They've almost been rioting for it. 
I'll go with them — and you, too, Percy — the whole 



 

crowd of us idlers will go! When we come out, we'll 
know something about the business of coal-mining ! " 
" All right, I'm with you ' said the Coal King's son. 



 Hal never knew what Percy said to Cartwright 
that night; he only knew that when they arrived at the 
mine the superintendent was summoned to a consultation, 
and half an hour later Percy emerged smiling, with the 
announcement that Hal Warner had been mistaken all 
along; the mine authorities had been making all possible 
haste to get the fan ready, with the intention of opening 
the mine at the earliest moment. The work was now com- 

m 

pleted, and in an hour or two the fan was to be started, and 
by morning there would be a chance of rescuers getting in. 
Percy said this so innocently that for a moment Hal won- 
dered if Percy himself might not believe it. Hal's posi- 
tion as guest of course required that he should graciously 
pretend to believe it, consenting to appear as a fool before 
the rest of the company. 

Percy invited Hal and Billy Keating to spend the night 
in the train ; but this Hal declined. He was too dirty, he 
said ; besides, he wanted to be up at daylight, to be one of 
the first to go down the shaft. Percy answered that the 
superintendent had vetoed this proposition — he did not 
want any one to go down but experienced men, who could 
take care of themselves. When there were so many on 
hand ready and eager to go, there was no need to imperil 
the lives of amateurs. 

At the risk of seeming ungracious, Hal declared that he 
would "hang around" and see them take the cover off 
the pit-mouth. There were mourning parties in some of 
the cabins, where women were gathered together who could 
not sleep, and it would be an act of charity to take them 
the good news. 



 

Hal and Keating set out; they went first to the Eaf- 
ferties', and saw Mrs. Kafferty spring up and stare at 
them, and then scream aloud to the Holy Virgin, waking 
all the little Rafferties to frightened clamour. When 
the woman had made sure that they really knew what they 
were talking about, she rushed out to spread the news, and 
so pretty soon the streets were alive with hurrying figures, 
and a crowd gathered once more at the pit-mouth. 

Hal and Keating went on to Jerry Minetti's. Out of a 
sense of loyalty to Percy, Hal did no more than repeat 
Percy's own announcement, that it had been Cartwright's 
intention all along to have the mine opened. It was funny 
to see the effect of this statement — the face with which 
Jerry looked at Hal! But they wasted no time in dis- 
cussion; Jerry slipped into his clothes and hurried with 
them to the pit-mouth. 

Sure enough, a gang was already tearing off the boards 
and canvas. Never since Hal had been in North Valley 
had he seen men working with such a will! Soon the 
great fan began to stir, and then to roar, and then to sing; 
and there was a crowd of a hundred people, roaring and 
singing also. 

It would be some hours before anything more could be 
done; and suddenly Hal realised that he was exhausted. 
He and Billy Keating went back to the Minetti cabin, 
and spreading themselves a blanket on the floor, lay down 
with sighs of relief. As for Billy, he was soon snoring; 
but to Hal there came sudden reaction from all the excite- 
ment, and sleep was far from him. 

An ocean of thoughts came flooding into his mind : the 
world outside, his world, which he had banished deliber- 
ately for several months, and which he had so suddenly 
been compelled to remember! It had seemed so simple, 
what he had set out to do that summer : to take another 
name, to become a member of another class, to live its life 
and think its thoughts, and then come back to his own 



 

world with a new and f ascinting adventure to tell about ! 
The possibility that his own world, the world of Hal 
Warner, might find him out as Joe Smith, the miner's 
buddy — that was a possibility which had never come to 
his mind. He was like a burglar, working away at a job 
in darkness, and suddenly finding the room flooded with 
light. 

He had gone into the adventure, prepared to find things 
that would shock him ; he had known that somehow, some- 
where, he would have to fight the " system." But he had 
never expected to find himself in the thick of the class- 
war, leading a charge upon the trenches of his own associ- 
ates. Nor was this the end, he knew ; this war would not 
be settled by the winning of a trench ! Lying here in the 
darkness and silence, Hal was realising what he had got 
himself in for. To employ another simile, he was a man 
who begins a flirtation on the street, and wakes up next 
morning to find himself married. 

It was not that he had regrets for the course he had 
taken with Percy. No other course had been thinkable. 
But while Hal had known these North Valley people for 
ten weeks, he had known the occupants of Percy's car for 
as many years. So these latter personalities loomed large 
in his consciousness, and here in the darkness their 
thoughts about him, whether actively hostile or passively 
astonished, laid siege to the defences of his mind. 

Particularly . he found himself wrestling with Jessie 
Arthur. Her face rose up before him, appealing, yearn- 
ing. She had one of those perfect faces, which irre- 
sistibly compel the soul of a man. Her brown eyes, soft 
and shining, full of tenderness ; her lips, quick to tremble 
with emotion ) her skin like apple-blossoms, her hair with 
star-dust in it ! Hal was cynical enough about coal-oper- 
ators and mine-guards, but it never occurred to him that 
Jessie's soul might be anything but what these bodily 
charms implied. t He was in love with her; and he was too
