" Yes, my child ; I made it. Don't you think I am clever ? " 

" Yes, papa, very clever ; I also have learned to make pic- 
tures." And she turned round and showed a small, fair face, of 
which the natural and usual expression seemed to be a smile of 
perfect sweetness. 

"You should have brought me a specimen of your powers." 

" I have brought a great many ; they are in my trunk," said 
the child. 

" She draws very very carefully," the elder of the nuns 
remarked, speaking in French. 

" I am glad to hear it. Is it you who have instructed her? " 

" Happily, no," said the good sister, blushing a little. " Ce 
n'est pas ma partie. I teach nothing ; I leave that to those who 
are wiser. We have an excellent drawing-master, Mr. Mr. 
what is his name? " she asked of her companion. 

Her companion looked about at the carpet. 

" It's a German name," she said in Italian, as if it needed to 
be translated. 

" Yes," the other went on, " he is a German, and we have had 
him for many years." 

The young girl, who was not heeding the conversation, had 
wandered away to the open door of the large room, and stood 
looking into the garden. 

" And you, my sister, are French," said the gentleman. 

" Yes, sir," the woman replied, gently. " I speak to the pupils 
in my own language. I know no other. But we have sisters of 
other countries English, German, Irish. They all speak their 
own tongue." 

The gentleman gave a smile. 

" Has my daughter been under the care of one of the Irish 
ladies'? " And then, as he saw that his visitors suspected a joke, 
but failed to understand it " You are very complete," he said, 
instantly. 

" Oh, yes, we are complete. We have everything, and every- 
thing is of the best." 

" We have gymnastics," the Italian sister ventured to remark. 
" But not dangerous." 

" I hope not. Is that your branch ? " A question which 
provoked much candid hilarity on the part of the two ladies ; on 
the subsidence of which their entertainer, glancing at his daughter, 
remarked that she had grown. 

" Yes, but I think she has finished. She will remain little,' 
said the French sister. 

" I am not sorry. I like little women," the gentleman declared, 



 

frankly. "But I know no particular reason why my child 
should be short." 

The nun gave a temperate shrug, as if to intimate that such 
things might be beyond our knowledge. 

" She is in very good health ; that is the best thing." 

"Yes, she looks well." And the young girl's father watched 
her a moment. "What do you see in the garden ?" he asked, in 
French. 

" I see many flowers," she replied, in a sweet, small voice, 
and with a French accent as good as his own. 

" Yes, but not many good ones. However, such as they are, 
go out and gather some for ces dames." 

The child turned to him, with her smile brightened by pleasure. 
" May I, truly? " she asked. 

" Ah, when I tell you," said her father. 

The girl glanced at the elder of the nuns. 

" May I, truly, ma mere ? " 

"Obey monsieur your father, my child," said the sister, 
blushing again. 

The child, satisfied with this authorisation, descended from the 
threshold, and was presently lost to sight. 

" You don't spoil them," said her father, smiling. 

" For everything they must ask leave. That is our system. 
Leave is freely granted, but they must ask it." 

" Oh, I don't quarrel with your system ; I have no doubt it is 
a very good one. I sent you my daughter to see what you would 
make of her. I had faith." 

" One must have faith," the sister blandly rejoined, gazing 
through her spectacles. 

" Well, has my faith been rewarded? What have you made 
of her ? " 

The sister dropped her eyes a moment. 

" A good Christian, monsieur." 

Her host dropped his eyes as well ; but it was probable that 
the movement had in each case a different spring. 

" Yes," he said in a moment, " and what else? " 

He watched the lady from the convent, probably thinking 
that she would say that a good Christian was everything. 

But for all her simplicity, she was not so crude as that. " A 
charming young lady a real little woman a daughter in whom 
you will have nothing but contentment." 

" She seems to me very nice," said the father. " She is very 
pretty." 

" She is perfect. She has no faults." 



 

" She never had any as a child, and I am glad you have given 
her none." 

" We love her too much," said the spectacled sister, with dig- 
nity. " And as for faults, how can we give what we have not? 
Le convent n'est pas comme le monde, monsieur. She is our child, 
as you may say. We have had her since she was so small." 

" Of all those we shall lose this year she is the one we shall 
miss most," the younger woman murmured, deferentially. 

" Ah, yes, we shall talk long of her," said the other. "We 
shall hold her up to the new ones." 

And at this the good sister appeared to find her spectacles 
dim ; while her companion, after fumbling a moment, presently 
drew forth a pocket-handkerchief of durable texture. 

" It is not certain that you will lose her ; nothing is settled 
yet," the host rejoined, quickly; not as if to anticipate their 
tears, but in the tone of a man saying what was most agreeable 
to himself. 

" We should be very happy to believe that. Fifteen is very 
young to leave us." 

" Oh," exclaimed the gentleman, with more vivacity than he 
had yet used, " it is not I who wish to take her away. I wish 
you could keep her always ! " 

" Ah, monsieur," said the elder sister, smiling and getting up, 
" good as she is, she is made for the world. Le monde y gagnera." 

"If all the good people were hidden away in convents, how 
would the world get on   " her companion softly inquired, rising 
also. 

This was a question of a wider bearing than the good woman 
apparently supposed ; and the lady in spectacles took a harmon- 
ising view by saying comfortably 

" Fortunately there are good people everywhere." 

" If you are going there will be two less here," her host 
remarked, gallantly. 

For this extravagant sally his simple visitors had no answer, 
and they simply looked at each other in decent deprecation ; but 
their confusion was speedily covered by the return of the young 
girl, with two large bunches of roses one of them all white, the 
other red. 

" I give you your choice, mamman Catherine," said the child. 
" It is only the colour that is different, mamman Justine  there 
are just as many roses in one bunch as another." 

The two sisters turned to each other, smiling and hesitating, with 
" Which will you take?" and " No, it's for you to choose." 

"I will take the red," said mother Catherine, in the spec- 



 

tacles. " I am so red myself. They will comfort us on our 
way back to Rome." 

" Ah, they won't last," cried the young girl. " I wish I 
could give you something that would last ! " 

" You have given us a good memory of yourself, my daughter. 
That will last!" 

" I wish nuns could wear pretty things. I would give you 
my blue beads," the child went on. 

" And do you go back to Home to-night? " her father asked. 

"Yes, we take the train again. We have so much to do 
Id-bas." 

"Are you not tired?" 

" We are never tired." 

" Ah, my sister, sometimes," murmured the junior votaress. 

" Not to-day, at any rate. We have rested too well here. 
Que Dieu vous garde, ma fille" 

Their host, while they exchanged kisses with his daughter, 
went forward to open the door through which they were to 
pass ; but as he did so he gave a slight exclamation, and stood 
looking beyond. The door opened into a vaulted ante-chamber, 
as high as a chapel, and paved with red tiles ; and into this 
ante-chamber a lady had just been admitted by a servant, a lad 
in shabby livery, who was now ushering her toward the apart- 
ment in which our friends were grouped. The gentleman at the 
door, after dropping his exclamation, remained silent; in silence, 
too, the lady advanced. He gave her no further audible greeting, 
and offered her no hand, but stood aside to let her pass into the 
drawing-room. At the threshold she hesitated. 

" Is there any one? " she asked. 

" Some one you may see." 

She went in, and found herself confronted with the two nuns 
and their pupil, who was coming forward between them, with a 
hand in the arm of each. At the sight of the new visitor they 
all paused, and the lady, who had stopped too, stood looking at 
them. The young girl gave a little soft cry 

" Ah, Madame Merle ! " 

The visitor had been slightly startled ; but her manner the 
next instant was none the less gracious. 

" Yes, it's Madame Merle, come to welcome you home." 

And she held out two hands to the girl, who immediately 
came up to her, presenting her forehead to be kissed. Madame 
Merle saluted this portion of her charming little person, and 
then stood smiling at the two nuns. They acknowledged her 
smile with a decent obeisance, but permitted themselves no direct 



 

scrutiny of this imposing, brilliant woman, who seemed to bring 
in with her something of the radiance of the outer world. 

" These ladies have brought my daughter home, and now they 
return to the convent.' the gentleman explained. 

" Ah, you go back to Eome ? I have lately come from there. 
It is very lovely now," said Madame Merle. 

The good sisters, standing with their hands folded into their 
sleeves, accepted this statement uncritically ; and the master of 
the house asked Madame Merle how long it was since she had 
left Rome. 

" She came to see me at the convent," said the young girl, 
before her father's visitors had time to reply. 

" I have been more than once, Pansy," Madame Merle 
answered. " Am I not your great friend in Rome ? " 

"I remember the last time best," said Pansy, "because you 
told me I should leave the place." 

"Did you tell her that?" the child's father asked. 

" I hardly remember. I told her what I thought would 
please her. I have been in Florence a week. I hoped you 
would come and see me." 

" I should have done so if I had known you were here. One 
doesn't know such things by inspiration though I suppose one 
ought. You had better sit down." 

These two speeches were made in a peculiar tone of voice a 
tone half-lowered, and carefully quiet, but as from habit rather 
than from any definite need. 

Madame Merle looked about her, choosing her seat. 

" You are going to the door with these women? Let me of 
course not interrupt the ceremony. Je vous salue, mesdames" 
she added, in French, to the nuns, as if to dismiss them. 

" This lady is a great friend of ours ; you will have seen her 
at the convent," said the host. " We have much faith in her 
judgment, and she will help me to decide whether my daughter 
shall return to you at the end of the holidays." 

" I hope you will decide in our favour, madam," the sister in 
spectacles ventured to remark. 

" That is Mr. Osmond's pleasantry ; I decide nothing," said 
Madame Merle, smiling still. " I believe you have a very good 
school, but Miss Osmond's friends must remember that she is 
meant for the world." 

" That is what I have told monsieur," sister Catherine 
answered "It is precisely to fit her for the world," she 
murmured, glancing at Pansy, who stood at a little distance 
looking at Madame Merle's elegant apparel. 



 

" Do you hear that, Pansy ? You are meant for the world," 
said Pansy's father. 

The child gazed at him an instant with her pure young eyes. 

" Am I not meant for you, papa? " she asked. 

Papa gave a quick, light laugh. 

" That doesn't prevent it ! I am of the world, Pansy." 

" Kindly permit us to retire," said sister Catherine. " Be 
good, in any case, my daughter." 

" I shall certainly come back and see you," Pansy declared, 
recommencing her embraces, which were presently interrupted 
by Madame Merle. 

" Stay with me, my child," she said, " while your father 
takes the good ladies to the door." 

Pansy stared, disappointed, but not protesting. She was 
evidently impregnated with the idea of submission, which was 
due to any one who took the tone of authority ; and she was a 
passive spectator of the operation of her fate. 

' " May I not see mamman Catherine get into the carriage ? " 
she asked very gently. 

" It would please me better if you would remain with me," 
said Madame Merle, while Mr. Osmond and his companions, 
who had bowed low again to the other visitor, passed into the 
ante-chamber. 

" Oh yes, I will stay," Pansy answered ; and she stood near 
Madame Merle, surrendering her little hand, which this lady took. 
She stared out of the window ; her eyes had filled with tears. 

" I am glad they have taught you to obey," said Madame 
Merle. " That is what little girls should do." ' 

" Oh yes, I obey very well,' ' said Pansy, with soft eagerness, 
almost with boastf illness, as if she had been speaking of her 
piano-playing. And then she gave a faint, just audible sigh. 

Madame Merle, holding her hand, drew it across her own 
fine palm and looked at it. The gaze was critical, but it found 
nothing to deprecate; the child's small hand was delicate and fair. 

" I hope they always see that you wear gloves," she said in 
a moment. " Little girls usually dislike them." 

"I used to dislike them, but I like them now," the child 
answered. 

" Very good, I will make you a present of a dozen." 

" I thank you very much. What colours will they be? " 
Pansy demanded, with interest. 

Madame Merle meditated a moment. 

" Useful colours." 

" But will they be pretty?" 



 

" Are you fond of pretty things ? " 

"Yes ; but but not too fond," said Pansy, with a trace of 
asceticism. 

" Well, they will not be too pretty," Madame Merle answered, 
with a laugh. She took the child's other hand, and drew her 
nearer ; and then, looking at her a moment " Shall you miss 
mother Catherine 2 " 

" Yes when I think of her." 

" Try, then, not to think of her. Perhaps some day," added 
Madame Merle, " you will have another mother." 

"I don't think that is necessary," Pansy said, repeating her 
little soft, conciliatory sigh. " I had more than thirty mothers 
at the convent." 

Her father's step sounded again in the ante-chamber, and 
Madame Merle got up, releasing the child. Mr. Osmond came 
in and closed the door ; then, without looking at Madame Merle, 
he pushed one or two chairs back into their places. 

His visitor waited a moment for him to speak, watching him 
as he moved about. Then at last she said " I hoped you would 
have come to Rome. I thought it possible you would have 
come to fetch Pansy away." 

" That was a natural supposition ; but I am afraid it is not 
the first time I have acted in defiance of your calculations." 

" Yes," said Madame Merle, " I think you are very perverse." 

Mr. Osmond busied himself for a moment in the room there 
was plenty of space in it to move about in the fashion of a 
man mechanically seeking pretexts for not giving an attention 
which may be embarrassing. Presently, however, he had ex- 
hausted his pretexts ; there was nothing left for him unless 
he took up a book but to stand with his hands behind him, 
looking at Pansy. " Why didn't you come and bee the last of 
rnamman Catherine? " he asked of her abruptly, in French. 

Pansy hesitated a moment, glancing at Madame Merle. " I 
asked her to stay with me," said this lady, who had seated 
herself again in another place. 

"Ah, that was better," said Osmond. Then, at last, he 
dropped into a chair, and sat looking at Madame Merle ; leaning 
forward a little, with his elbows on the edge of the arms and 
his hands interlocked. 

" She is going to give me some gloves," said Pansy. 

" You needn't tell that to every one, my dear," Madame Merle 
observed. 

" You are very kind to her," said Osmond. " She is sup- 
posed to have everything she needs." 



 

" I should think she had had enough of the nuns." 

" If we are going to discuss that matter, she had better go 
out of the room." 

" Let her stay," said Madame Merle. " We will talk of 
something else." 

" If you like, I won't listen," Pansy suggested, with an 
appearance of candour which imposed conviction. 

" You may listen, charming child, because you won't under- 
stand," her father replied. The child sat down deferentially, 
near the open door, within sight of the garden, into which she 
directed her innocent, wistful eyes ; and Mr. Osmond went on, 
irrelevantly, addressing himself to his other companion. " You 
are looking particularly well." 

" I think I always look the same," said Madame Merle. 

"You always are the same. You don't vary. You are a 
wonderful woman." 

"Yes, I think I am." 

" You sometimes change your mind, however. You told me 
on your return from England that you would not leave Rome 
again for the present." 

" I am pleased that you remember so well what I say. That 
was my intention. But I have come to Florence to meet some 
friends who have lately arrived, and as to whose movements I 
was at that time uncertain." 

" That reason is characteristic. You are always doing some- 
thing for your friends." 

Madame Merle looked straight at her interlocutor, smiling. 
" It is less characteristic than your comment upon it which is 
perfectly insincere. I don't, however, make a crime of that," 
she added, " because if you don't believe what you say there is 
no reason why you should. I don't ruin myself for my friends ; 
I don't deserve your praise. I care greatly for myself." 

"Exactly; but yourself includes so many other selves so 
much of everything. I never knew a person whose life touched 
so many other lives." 

" What do you call one's life? " asked Madame Merle. "One's 
appearance, one's movements, one's engagements, one's society?" 

' I call your life your ambitions," said Osmond. 

Madame Merle looked a moment at Pansy. "I wonder 
whether she understands that," she murmured. 

" You see she can't stay with us ! " And Pansy's father gave 
a rather joyless smile. " Go into the garden, ma bonne, and 
pluck a flower or two for Madame Merle," he went on, in 
French. 



 

" That's just what I wanted to do," Pansy exclaimed, rising 
with promptness and noiselessly departing. Her father followed 
her to the open door, stood a moment watching her, and then 
came back, but remained standing, or rather strolling to and 
fro, as if to cultivate a sense of freedom which in another atti- 
tude might be wanting. 

" My ambitions are principally for you," said Madame Merle, 
looking up at him with a certain nobleness of expression. 

" That comes back to what I say. I am part of your life I 
and a thousand others. You are not selfish I can't admit that. 
If you were selfish, what should I be? What epithet would 
properly describe me? " 

" You are indolent. For me that is your worst fault." 

" I am afraid it is really my best." 

" You don't care," said Madame Merle, gravely. 

" No ; I don't think I care much. What sort of a fault do 
you call that? My indolence, at any rate, was one of the 
reasons I didn't go to Rome. But it was only one of them." 

"It is not of importance to me at least that you didn't 
go ; though I should have been glad to see you. I am glad 
that you are not in Rome now which you might be, would 
probably be, if you had gone there a month ago. There is 
something I should like you to do at present in Florence." 

" Please remember my indolence," said Osmond. 

" I will remember it ; but I beg you to forget it. In that 
way you will have both the virtue and the reward. This is not 
a great labour, and it may prove a great pleasure. How long is 
it since you made a new acquaintance? " 

" I don't think I have made any since I made yours." 

" It is time you should make another, then. There is a 
friend of mine I want you to know." 

Mr. Osmond, in his walk, had gone back to the open door 
again, and was looking at his daughter, as she moved about in 
the intense sunshine. " What good will it do me? " he asked, 
with a sort of genial crudity. 

Madame Merle reflected a moment. " It will amuse you." 
There was nothing crude in this rejoinder ; it had been thoroughly 
well considered. 

" If you say that, I believe it," said Osmond, coming toward 
her. " There are some points in which my confidence in you is 
complete. I am perfectly aware, for instance, that you know 
good society from bad." 

" Society is all bad." 

" Excuse me. That isn't a common sort of wisdom. You have 



 

gained it in the right way experimentally ; you have compared 
an immense number of people with each other." 

" Well, I invite you to profit by my knowledge." 

" To profit? Are you very sure that I shall ? " 

" It's what I hope. It will depend upon yourself. If I could 
only induce you to make an effort ! " 

" Ah, there you are ! I knew something tiresome was coming. 
What in the world that is likely to turn up here is worth an 
effort ?" 

Madame Merle flushed a little, and her eye betrayed vexation. 
" Don't be foolish, Osmond. There is no one knows better than 
you that there are many things worth an effort." 

" Many things, I admit. But they are none of them probable 
things." 

" It is the effort that makes them probable," said Madame 
Merle. 

" There's something in that. Who is your friend? " 

" The person I came to Florence to see. She is a niece of 
Mrs. Touchett, whom you will not have forgotten." 

" A niece? The word niece suggests youth. I see what you 
are coming to." 

" Yes, she is young twenty-two years old. She is a great 
friend of mine. I met her for the first time in England, several 
months ago, and we took a great fancy to each other. I like her 
immensely, and I do what I don't do every day I admire her. 
You will do the same." 

"Not if 'I can help it." 

" Precisely. But you won't be able to help it." 

" Is she beautiful, clever, rich, splendid, universally intelli- 
gent and unprecedentedly virtuous ? It is only on those condi- 
tions that I care to make her acquaintance. You know I asked 
you some time ago never to speak to me of any one who should 
not correspond to that description. I know plenty of dingy 
people ; I don't want to know any more." 

" Miss Archer is not dingy ; she's as bright as the morning. 
She corresponds to your description ; it is for that I wish you to 
know her. She fills all your requirements." 

" More or less, of course." 

" No ; quite literally. She is beautiful, accomplished, gener- 
ous, and for an American, well-born. She is also very clever 
and very amiable, and she has a handsome fortune." 

Mr. Osmond listened to this in silence, appearing to turn it 
over in his mind, with his eyes on his informant. " What do 
you want to do with her? " he asked, at last. 


" What you see. Put her in your way." 

" Isn't she meant for something better than that? " 

{t I don't pretend to know what people are meant for," said 
Madame Merle. " I only know what I can do with them." 

" I am sorry for Miss Archer ! " Osmond declared. 

Madame Merle got up. " If that is a beginning of interest in 
her, I take note of it." 

The two stood there, face to face ; she settled her mantilla, 
looking down at it as she did so. 

" You are looking very well," Osmond repeated, still more 
irrelevantly than before. " You have got some idea. You are 
never as well as when you have got an idea ; they are always 
becoming to you." 

In the manner of these two persons, on first meeting on any 
occasion, and especially when they met in the presence of others, 
there was something indirect and circumspect, which showed 
itself in glance and tone. They approached each other obliquely, 
as it were, and they addressed each other by implication. The 
effect of each appeared to be to intensify to an embarrassing 
degree the self-consciousness of the other. Madame Merle of 
course carried off such embarrassments better than her friend ; 
but even Madame Merle had not on this occasion the manner 
she would have liked to have the perfect self-possession she 
would have wished to exhibit to her host. The point I wish 
to make is, however, that at a certain moment the obstruction, 
whatever it was, always levelled itself, and left them more closely 
face to face than either of them ever was with any one else. 
This was what had happened now. They stood there, knowing 
each other well, and each of them on the whole willing to accept 
the satisfaction of knowing, as a compensation for the inconveni- 
ence whatever it might be of being known. 

" I wish very much you were not so heartless," said Madame 
Merle, quietly. " It has always been against you, and it will be 
against you now." 

" I am not so heartless as you think. Every now and then 
something touches me as for instance your saying just now that 
your ambitions are for me. I don't understand it ; I don't 
see how or why they should be. But it touches me, all the 
same." 

" You will probably understand it even less as time goes on. 
There are some things you will never understand. There is no 
particular need that you should." 

"You, after all, are the most remarkable woman," said 
Osmond. " You have more in you than almost any one. I 


don't see why you think Mrs. Touchett's niece should matter 
very much to me, when when " and he paused a moment. 

" When I myself have mattered so little ? " 

" That of course is not what I meant to say. When I have 
known and appreciated such a woman as you." 

" Isabel Archer is better than I," said Madame Merle. 

Her companion gave a laugh. " How little you must think 
of -her to say that ! " 

" Do you suppose I am capable of jealousy? Please answer 
me that." 

" With regard to me? No ; on the whole I don't." 

" Come and see me, then, two days hence. I am staying at 
Mrs. Touchett's the Palazzo Crescentini and the girl will be 
there." 

" Why didn't you ask me that at first, simply, without speak- 
ing of the girl? " said Osmond. " You could have had her there 
at any rate." 

Madame Merle looked at him in the manner of a woman 
whom no question that he could ask would find unprepared. 
" Do you wish to know why? Because I have spoken of you 
to her." 

Osmond frowned and turned away. " I would rather not 
know that." Then, in a moment, he pointed out the easel sup- 
porting the little water-colour drawing. " Have you seen that 
my last? " 

Madame Merle drew near and looked at it a moment. " Is it 
die Venetian Alps one of your last year's sketches ?"

" Yes but how you guess everything ! " 

Madame Merle looked for a moment longer ; then she turned 
away. " You know I don't care for your drawings." 

" I know it, yet I am always surprised at it. They are really 
so much better than most people's." 

" That may very well be. But as the only thing you do, it's 
so little. I should have liked you to do so many other things : 
those were my ambitions." 

" Yes ; you have told me many times things that were 
impossible." 

" Things that were impossible," said Madame Merle. And 
then, in quite a different tone " In itself your little picture is 
very good." She looked about the room at the old cabinets, 
the pictures, the tapestries, the surfaces of faded silk. " Your 
rooms, at least, are perfect," she went on. " I am struck with 
that afresh, whenever I come back ; I know none better any- 
where. You understand this sort of thing as no one else does." 



" I am very sick of it," said Osmond. 

"You must let Miss Archer come and see all this. I have 
told her about it." 

" I don't object to showing my things when people are not 
idiots." 

" You do it delightfully. As a cicerone in your own museum 
you appear to particular advantage." 

Mr. Osmond, in return for this compliment, simply turned 
upon his companion an eye expressive of perfect clairvoyance. 

" Did you say she was rich? " he asked in a moment. 

" She has seventy thousand pounds." 

" En ecus bien comptes ? " 

tl There is no doubt whatever about her fortune. I have seen 
it, as I may say." 

" Satisfactory woman ! I mean you. And if I go to see her, 
shall I see the mother? " 

" The mother? She has none nor father either." 

" The aunt then ; whom did you say? Mrs. Touchett." 

" I can easily keep her out of the way." 

" I don't object to her," said Osmond ; " I rather like Mrs. 
Touchett. She has a sort of old-fashioned character that is 
passing away a vivid identity. But that long jackanapes, the 
son is he about the place? " 

" He is there, but he won't trouble you." 

" He's an awful ass." 

" I think you are mistaken. He is a very clever man. But 
he is not fond of being about when I am there, because he doesn't 
like me." 

" What could be more asinine than that ? Did you say that 
she was pretty ? " Osmond went on. 

" Yes ; but I won't say it again, lest you should be disap- 
pointed. Come and make a beginning; that is all I ask of 
you." 

" A beginning of what? " 

Madame Merle was silent a moment. " I want you of course 
to marry her." 

"The beginning of the end! Well, I will see for myself. 
Have you told her that ? " 

" For what do you take me ? She is a very delicate piece of 
machinery." 

"Really," said Osmond, after some meditation, "I don't 
understand your ambitions." 

" I think you will understand this one after you have seen 
Miss Archer. Suspend your judgment till then." Madame 



 

Merle, as she spoke, had drawn near the open door of the 
garden, where she stood a moment, looking out. " Pansy has 
grown pretty," she presently added. 

" So it seemed to me." 

" But she has had enough of the convent." 

" I don't know," said Osmond. " I like what they have made 
of her. It's very charming." 

" That's not the convent. It's the child's nature." 

" It's the combination, I think. She's as pure as a pearl." 

" Why doesn't she come back with my flowers, then? " Madame 
Merle asked. " She is not in a hurry." 

" We will go and get them," said her companion. 

" She doesn't like me," murmured Madame Merle, as she raised 
her parasol, and they passed into the garden. 



XXIII. 

MADAME MERLE, who had come to Florence on Mrs. Touchett's 
arrival at the invitation of this lady Mrs. Touchett offering her 
for a month the hospitality of the Palazzo Crescentini the 
judicious Madame Merle spoke to Isabel afresh about Gilbert 
Osmond, and expressed the wish that she should know him ; but 
made no such point of the matter as we have seen her do in 
recommending the girl herself to Mr. Osmond's attention. The 
reason of this was perhaps that Isabel offered no resistance 
whatever to Madame Merle's proposal. In Italy, as in England, 
the lady had a multitude of friends, both among the natives of 
the country and its heterogeneous visitors. She had mentioned 
to Isabel most of the people the girl would find it well to know 
of course, she said, Isabel could know whomever she would 
and she had placed Mr. Osmond near the top of the list. He 
was an old friend of her own ; she had known him these ten 
years ; he was one of tlie cleverest and most agreeable men it 
was possible to meet. He was altogether above the respectable 
average ; quite another affair. He was not perfect far from 
it ; the effect he produced depended a good deal on the state of 
his nerves and his spirits. If he were not in the right mood he 
could be very unsatisfactory like most people, after all; but 
when he chose to exert himself no man could do it to better 
purpose. He had his peculiarities which indeed Isabel would 
find to be the case with all the men really worth knowing and 
he did not cause his light to shine equally for all persons. 




Madame Merle, however, thought she could undertake that for 
Isabel he would be brilliant. He was easily bored too easily, 
and dull people always put him out ; but a quick and cultivated 
girl like Isabel would give him a stimulus which was too absent 
from his life. At any rate, he was a person to know. One 
should not attempt to live in Italy without making a friend of 
Gilbert Osmond, who knew more about the country than any 
one except two or three German professors. And if they had 
more knowledge than he, he had infinitely more taste ; he had a 
taste which was quite by itself. Isabel remembered that her 
friend had spoken of him during their multifarious colloquies at 
Gardencourt, and wondered a little what was the nature of the 
tie that united them. She was inclined to imagine that Madame 
Merle's ties were peculiar, and such a possibility was a part of 
the interest created by this suggestive woman. As regards her 
relations with Mr. Osmond, however, Madame Merle hinted at 
nothing but a long-established and tranquil friendship. Isabel 
said that she should be happy to know a person who had enjoyed 
her friend's confidence for so many years. "You ought to' see a 
great many men," Madame Merle remarked ; " you ought to see 
as many as possible, so as to get used to them." 

" Used to them ? " Isabel repeated, with that exceedingly 
serious gaze which sometimes seemed to proclaim that she was 
deficient in a sense of humour an intimation which at other 
moments she effectively refuted. " I am not afraid of them." 

" Used to them, I mean, so as to despise them. That's what 
one comes to with most of them. You will pick out, for your 
society, the few whom you don't despise." 

This remark had a bitterness which Madame Merle did not 
often allow herself to betray ; but Isabel was not alarmed by it, 
for she had never supposed that, as one saw more of the world, 
the sentiment of respect became the most active of one's emotions. 
This sentiment was excited, however, by the beautiful city of 
Florence, which pleased her not less than Madame Merle had 
promised ; and if her unassisted perception had not been able to 
gauge its charms, she had clever companions to call attention to 
latent merits. She was in no want, indeed, of aesthetic illumin- 
ation, for Ralph found it a pleasure which renewed his own 
earlier sensations, to act as cicerone to his eager young kinswoman. 
Madame Merle remained at home ; she had seen the treasures of 
Florence so often, and she had always something to do. But 
she talked of all things with remarkable vividness of memory 
she remembered the right-hand angle in the large Perugino, and 
the position of the hands of the Saint Elizabeth in the picture 



 

next to it; and had her own opinions as to the character of many 
famous works of art, differing often from Ralph with great sharp- 
ness, and defending her interpretations with as much ingenuity 
as good-humour. Isabel listened to the discussions which took 
place between the two, with a sense that she might derive much 
benefit from them and that they were among the advantages 
which for instance she could not have enjoyed in Albany. 
In the clear May mornings, before the formal breakfast this 
repast at Mrs. Touchett's was served at twelve o'clock Isabel 
wandered, about with her cousin through the narrow and sombre 
Florentine streets, resting a while in the thicker dusk of some 
historic church, or the vaulted chambers of some dispeopled con- 
vent. She went to the galleries and palaces ; she looked at the 
pictures and statues which had hitherto been great names to her, 
and exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation 
a presentiment which proved usually to have been a blank. She 
performed all those acts of mental prostration in which, on a 
first visit to Italy, youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge ; she 
felt her heart beat in the presence of immortal genius, and knew 
the sweetness of rising tears in eyes to which faded fresco and 
darkened marble grew dim. But the return, every day, was even 
pleasanter than the going forth ; the return into the wide, monu- 
mental court of the great house in which Mrs. Touchett, many 
years before, had established herself, and into the high, cool 
rooms where carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the sixteenth 
century looked down upon the familiar commodities of the 
nineteenth. Mrs. Touchett inhabited an historic building in a 
narrow street whose very name recalled the strife of mediaeval 
factions ; and found compensation for the darkness of her front- 
age in the modicity of her rent and the brightness of a garden in 
which nature itself looked as archaic as the rugged architecture 
of the palace and which illumined the rooms that were in regular
