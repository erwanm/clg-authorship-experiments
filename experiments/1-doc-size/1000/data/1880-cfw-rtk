ship, and " Marcher the saddle-horse. 



 

" I shall certainly need horses," he said aloud. 

" And you will apply to Mr. Head ? " 

She was so eager that he forgot himself, and smiled. 

" Miss Dooris," he said, bowing, " I will apply to Mr. 
Head, and only to him ; I give you my word." 

She brightened at once. 

The golden shafts of the setting sun shone full in her 
face : her dark eyes did not mind them ; she did not put up 
her hand to shield herself, but stood and looked directly into 
the glittering, brilliant western sky. He put his quizzical ex 
pression back out of sight, and began to talk to her. She 
answered him frankly. He tested her a little ; he was an old 
hand at it. Of coquetry she gave back not a sign. Grad 
ually the conviction came to him that she had not asked him 
up there for personal reasons at all. It was, then, the 
horses. 

When he had decided this, he sat down on a stump, and 
went on talking to her with renewed interest. After a while 
she laughed, and there came into her face that peculiar bril 
liancy which the conjunction of dark eyes and the gleam of 
white, even teeth can give to a thin-cheeked brunette. Then 
he remembered to look at her hands, and was relieved to find 
them, although a little roughened by toil, charmingly shaped 
and finely aristocratic fit portion of the tall, well-rounded 
figure, which only needed self-consciousness to be that of a 
young Diana. The girl seemed so happy and radiant, so im 
personal in the marked attention she gave to him, which was 
not unlike the attention she might have given to her grand 
father, that Wainwright recognized it at last as only another 
case of his being of no consequence, and smiled to himself 
over it. Evidently, if he wanted notice, he must, as it were, 
mount the horses. He had had no especial intention of mak 
ing excursions among the mountains ; but that was, appar 
ently, the fixed idea of these horse-owners. They were, for 
some reason, pleased to be mysterious ; he would be myste 
rious also. 



 

" I hope Mr. Head's horses are good ones ? " he said con 
fidentially ; " I shall need very good horses." 

All her color gone instantly, and the old cloud of anxiety 
on her face again. 

" Yes, they are good horses," she answered ; and then her 
eyes rested upon him, and he read trouble, fear, and dislike, 
succeeding each other openly in their dark depths. 

" Is it because I am a Northerner, Miss Dooris ? " he said 
quietly. He had made up his mind, rather unfairly, to break 
down the fence between them by a close question, which so 
young a girl would not know how to parry. 

She started, and the color rushed up all over her face 
again. 

" Of course, it is all right," she answered hurriedly, in a 
low voice. " I know that the laws must be maintained, and 
that some persons must do the work that you do. People 
can not always choose their occupations, I suppose, and no 
doubt they no doubt you I mean, that it can not be 
helped." 

" May I ask what you take me for ? " said Wainwright, 
watching her. 

" We saw it at once ; Mr. Head saw it, and afterward I 
did also. But we are experienced ; others may not discover 
you so soon. Mr. Head is anxious to pilot you through the 
mountains to save you from danger." 

" He is very kind ; disinterested, too." 

" No," said Honor, flushing again ; " I assure you he 
makes money by it also." 

" But you have not told me what it is you take me for, 
Miss Dooris ? " 

" It is not necessary, is it ? " replied Honor in a whisper. 
" You are one of the new revenue detectives, sent up here to 
search out the stills." 

"An informer after the moonlight whisky-makers, you 
mean ? " 

"Yes." 



Wainwright threw back his head and laughed out loud, 
as he had not laughed for years. 

" I am not sure but that it is a compliment," he said at 
last ; " no one has ever taken me for anything particular be 
fore in all my life." Then, when he was sober, " Miss Doo- 
ris," he said, " I am a man of leisure, residing in New York ; 
and I am sorry to say that I am an idle vagabond, with no 
occupation even so useful as that of a revenue detective." 

In spite of himself, however, a touch of contempt filtered 
into his voice. Then it came to him how the club-men would 
enjoy the story, and again he laughed uproariously. When 
he came to himself, Honor was crying. 

in. 

YES, Honor was crying. The dire mistake, the contempt, 
and, worse than all, the laughter, had struck the proud little 
Southern girl to the heart. 

" My dear child," said Wainwright, all the gentleman in 
him aroused at once, " why should you care for so small and 
natural a mistake ? It is all clear to me now. I gave no ac 
count of "myself coming over on the stage ; I remember, too, 
that I spoke of the moonlight whisky-makers myself, and that 
I made no effort to find out what Mr. Head was alluding 
to when he talked on in his mysterious way. It is my usual 
unpardonable laziness which has brought you to this error. 
Pray forgive it." 

Honor cried on, unable to stop, but his voice and words 
had soothed her; he stood beside her, hat in hand, and after 
a few moments she summoned self-control enough to dry her 
eyes and put down her handkerchief. But her eyelashes were 
still wet, her breath came tremulously, and there was a crim 
son spot on each cheek. She looked, at that moment, not 
more than fifteen years old, and Wainwright sat down, this 
time nearer to her, determined to make her feel easier. He 
banished the subject of her mistake at once, and began talk 
ing to her about herself. He asked many questions, and she 



 

answered them humbly, as a Lenten penitent might answer a 
father confessor. She seemed to feel as though she owed 
him everything he chose to take. She let him enter and walk 
through her life and mind, through all her hopes and plans ; 
one or two closed doors he noted, but did not try to open, 
neither did he let her see that he had discovered them. He 
learned how poor they were ; he learned her love for her un 
cle, her Switzer's attachment to the mountain-peaks about 
her ; he learned what her daily life was ; and he came near 
enough to her religious faith, that faith which had first at 
tracted him, to see how clear and deep it was, like a still pool 
in a shaded glen. It was years since Stephen Wainwright 
had been so close to a young girl's soul, and, to do him jus 
tice, he felt that he was on holy ground. 

When at last he left her, he had made up his mind that he 
would try an experiment. He would help this child out of 
the quagmire of poverty, and give her, in a small way, a 
chance. The question was, how to do it. He remained at 
Ellerby, made acquaintances, and asked questions. He pre 
tended this, and pretended that. Finally, after some consid 
eration, he woke up the old library association, reopened the 
building, and put in Honor as librarian, at a salary of two 
hundred dollars a year. To account for this, he was obliged, 
of course, to be much interested in Ellerby ; his talk was that 
the place must eventually become a summer resort, and that 
money could be very well invested there. He therefore in 
vested it. Discovering, among other things, pink marble on 
wild land belonging to the Colonel, he bought a whole hill 
side, and promptly paid for it. To balance this, he also 
bought half a mile of sulphur springs on the other side of the 
valley (the land comically cheap), and spoke of erecting a 
hotel there. The whole of Ellerby awoke, talked, and rejoiced ; no one dreamed that the dark eyes of one young girl 
had effected it all. 

Honor herself remained entirely unconscious. She was 
so openly happy over the library that Wainwright felt him- 



 

self already repaid. " It might stand against some of my 
omissions," he said to himself. 

One thing detained him where he was ; then another. 
He could not buy property without paying some attention to 
it, and he did not choose to send for his man of business. 
He staid on, therefore, all summer. And he sent books to 
the library now and then during the winter that followed 
packages which the librarian, of course, was obliged to ac 
knowledge, answering at the same time the questions of the 
letters which accompanied them. Stephen's letters were al 
ways formal ; they might have been nailed up on the walls of 
the library for all comers to read. He amused himself, how 
ever, not a little over the carefully written, painstaking an 
swers, in which the librarian remained " with great respect " 
his " obliged sen-ant, Honor Dooris." 

The second summer began, and he was again among the 
mountains ; but he should leave at the end of the month, he 
said. In the mean time it had come about that he was teach 
ing the librarian. She needed instruction, certainly ; and the 
steps that led up to it had been so gradual that it seemed 
natural enough now. But no one knew the hundred little 
things which had been done to make it seem so. 

What was he trying to do ? 

His cousin, Adelaide Kellinger, determined to find out that 
point, was already domiciled with her maid at the inn. There 
had been no concealment about Honor ; Wainwright had told 
Adelaide the whole story. He also showed to her the libra 
rian's little letters whenever they came, and she commented 
upon them naturally, and asked many questions. " Do you 
know, I feel really interested in the child myself ? " she said to 
him one day ; and it was entirely true. 

When he told her that he was going to the mountains 
again, she asked if he would not take her with him. " It will 
be a change from the usual summer places ; and, besides, I 
find I am lonely if long away from you," she said frankly. 
She always put it upon that ground. She had learned that 





nothing makes a man purr more satisfactorily than the hear 
ing that the woman in whose society he finds himself particu 
larly comfortable has an especial liking for and dependence 
upon himself ; immediately he makes it all a favor and kind 
ness to her, and is happy. So Adelaide came with Stephen, 
and did make him more comfortable. His barren room 
bloomed with fifty things which came out of her trunks and 
her ingenuity ; she coaxed and bribed the cook ; she won the 
landlady to a later breakfast. She arranged a little parlor, and 
was always there when he came home, ready to talk to him a 
little, but not too much ; ready to divine his mood and make 
the whole atmosphere accord with it at once. They had 
been there three weeks, and of course Adelaide had met the 
librarian. 

For those three weeks she remained neutral, and studied 
the ground ; then she began to act. She sent for John Royce. 
And she threw continuous rose-light around Honor. 

After the final tableau of a spectacle-play, a second view 
is sometimes given with the nymphs and fairies all made 
doubly beautiful by rose-light. Mrs. Kellinger now gave this 
glow. She praised Honor's beauty. 

Stephen had not observed it. How could he be so blind ? 
Why, the girl had fathomless eyes, exquisite coloring, the 
form of a Greek statue, and the loveliest mouth ! Then she 
branched off. 

" What a beautiful thing it would be to see such a girl as 
that fall in love ! a girl so impulsive, so ignorant of the 
world. That is exactly the kind of girl that really could die 
of a broken heart." 

" Could she ? " said Stephen. 

" Now, Stephen, you know as well as I do what Honor 
Dooris is," said Adelaide warmly. "She is not awakened 
yet, her prince has not made himself known to her; but, 
when he does awaken her, she will take him up to the seventh 
heaven." 

" That is if she loves him." 



 

" She has seen so few persons ; it would not be a difficult 
matter," said Adelaide. 

A few days later, when she told him that she was thinking 
of sending for John Royce, he made no comment, although 
she looked at him with undisguised wistfulness, a lingering 
gaze that seemed to entreat his questions. But he would 
not question, and, obedient as always to his will, she remained 
silent. 

John Royce came. He was another cousin, but a young 
one, twenty-five years old, blue-eyed and yellow-haired. He 
kept his yellow hair ruthlessly short, however, and he frowned 
more or less over his blue eyes, owing to much yachting and 
squinting ahead across the glaring water to gain an inch's 
length on the next boat. He was brown and big, with a 
rolling gait ; the edge of a boat tilted at one hair s-breadth 
from going over entirely, was his idea of a charming seat ; 
under a tree before a camp-fire, with something more than a 
suspicion of savage animals near, his notion of a delightful 
bed. He did not have much money of his own ; he was go 
ing to do something for himself by and by ; but Cousin Ade 
laide had always petted him, and he had no objection to a 
hunt among those Southern mountains. So he came. 

He had met Honor almost immediately. Mrs. Kellinger 
was a welcome visitor at the Eliot home ; she seemed to make 
the whole ravine more graceful. The Colonel's wife and all 
the children clustered around her with delight every time she 
came, and the old Colonel himself renewed his youth in her 
presence. She brought John to call upon them at once, and 
she took him to the library also ; she made Honor come and 
dine with them at the inn. She arranged a series of excur 
sions in a great mountain-wagon shaped like a boat, and 
tilted high up behind, with a canvas cover over a framework, 
like a Shaker bonnet, and drawn by six slow-walking horses. 
The wagoner being a postilion, they had the wagon to them 
selves ; they filled the interstices with Eliot children and 
baskets, and explored the wilder roads, going on foot up the 






steep banks above, drinking from the ice-cold spring, looking 
out for rattlesnakes, plucking the superb rhododendrons and 
the flowers of the calico-bush, and every now and then catch 
ing a new glimpse of the unparalleled crowd of peaks over to 
ward the Tennessee line. Stephen went everywhere patiently ; 
Honor went delightedly ; John Royce went carelessly ; Mrs. 
Kellinger went as the velvet string which held them all to 
gether ; she was so smooth that they slid easily. . 

But, in the intervals, Wainwright still taught his librarian. 

Mrs. Eliot had become Adelaide's warm friend. The 
sweet-voiced Southern wife, with her brood of children, and 
her calm, contented pride, confided to the Northern stranger 
the one grief of her life, namely, that she was the Colonel's 
second wife, and that he had dearly loved the first ; anxiety 
as to the uncertain future of her children weighed far less 
upon her mind than this. The old-time South preserved the 
romance of conjugal love even to silver hairs ; there may have 
been no more real love than at the North, but there was more 
of the manner of it. The second month came to its end ; it 
was now August. Mrs. Kellinger had sent many persons to 
the library ; she had roused up a general interest in it ; vil 
lagers now went there regularly for books, paying a small 
subscription-fee, which was added to Honor's salary. Honor 
thanked her for this in a rather awkward way. Mrs. Eliot, 
who was present, did not consider the matter of consequence 
enough for thanks. She had never even spoken to Wain 
wright of Honor's office of librarian, or the salary which came 
out of his pocket. Money-matters were nothing ; between 
friends they were less than nothing. Stephen had two hours 
alone with his librarian every morning, when there was no 
excursion ; Mrs. Kellinger had arranged that, by inventing a 
rule and telling it to everybody in a decided tone : no one was 
expected at the library before eleven o clock. 

"Did you do this ? " said Stephen, when he discovered it. 

" I did." 

"Why?" 




" Because I thought you would like it," replied Adelaide. 
He looked at her questioningly ; she answered immediately to 
the look. " You are interested in a new study of character, 
Stephen ; you are really doing the child a world of good too ; 
although, as usual, I confess that my interest in the matter is 
confined principally to your own entertainment." She spoke 
good-humoredly, and almost immediately afterward left him 
to himself. 

His mind ran back over a long series of little arrange 
ments made for his pleasure on all sorts of occasions. " She 
is the best-hearted woman in the world," he thought. And 
then he took his note-book and went over to the library. 

Their lessons would have amused a looker-on ; but there 
was no looker-on. Honor was interested or absent-minded, 
irritable or deeply respectful, humble or proud, by turns ; she 
regarded him as her benefactor, and she really wished to 
learn ; but she was young, and impulsive, and a girl. There 
was little conversation save upon the lessons, with the excep 
tion of one subject. The man of the world had begun his 
study of this girl's deep religious faith. " If you can give it to 
me also, or a portion of it," he had said, " you will be confer 
ring a priceless gift upon me, Miss Honor." 

Then Honor would throw down her books, clasp her 
hands, and, with glowing cheeks, talk to him on sacred sub 
jects. Many a time the tears would spring to her eyes with 
her own earnestness ; many a time she lost herself entirely 
while pleading with her whole soul. He listened to her, 
thanked her, and went away. Only once did he show any 
emotion : it was when she told him that she prayed for him. 

" Do you really pray for me ? " he said in a low tone ; 
then he put his hand over his eyes, and sat silent. 

Honor, a little frightened, drew back. It seemed to her a 
very simple act, praying for any one : she had prayed for pec- 
pie all her life. 

One Sunday afternoon Mrs. Eliot and Honor were sitting 
in Adelaide's parlor at the inn, whither she had brought them 



 

on their way home from service. Royce and Stephen had 
been discovered, upon their entrance, in two chairs at the 
windows ; the former surrounded by a waste of newspapers, 
magazines, and novels, thrown down on the floor, a general 
expression of heat and weariness on his face. His compan 
ion was reading a small, compact volume in his usual neat 
way. Big Royce was sprawled over three chairs ; Stephen 
did not fill one. Big Royce was drumming on the window- 
sill ; Stephen was motionless. Yet Royce, springing up and 
smiling, his blue eyes gleaming, and frank gladness on his 
face, was a picture that women remember; while Stephen, 
rising without change of expression, was a silent contradic 
tion to their small power, which is never agreeable. They all 
sat talking for an hour, Mrs. Eliot and Mrs. Kellinger con 
tributing most of the sentences. Royce was in gay spirits ; 
Honor rather silent. Suddenly there came a sharp, cracking 
sound ; they all ran to the window. Through the main street 
of the village a man was running, followed by another, who, 
three times in their sight and hearing, fired at the one in ad 
vance. One, two, three times they saw and heard him fire, 
and the sickening feeling of seeing a man murdered in plain 
sight came over them. Royce rushed down to the street. 
The victim had fallen ; the other man was himself staggering, 
and in the hands of a crowd which had gathered in an in 
stant. After a short delay the two men were borne away, one 
to his home, one to the jail. Royce returned hot and breath 
less. 

"Oh, how is the poor man who was "shot?" exclaimed 
Mrs. Eliot. 

" Poor man, indeed ! The other one is the man to be 
pitied," said Royce angrily. " He is a revenue detective, and 
was knocked down from behind with a club by this fellow, 
who is a liquor-seller here in the village. The blow was en 
the skull, and a murderous one. Half blinded and maddened, 
he staggered to his feet, drew his revolver, and fired for his 
life." 





Honor had grown white as ivory. She shook in every 
limb, her lips trembled, and her chin had dropped a little. 
Wainwright watched her. 

" But what does it all mean ? " asked Adelaide. 

" Moonlight whisky, of course. The detective has been 
hunting for the stills, and these outlaws will kill the man as 
they have killed half a dozen before him." 

" What an outrage ! Are there no laws ? " 

" Dead letters." 

" Or officers to execute them ? " 

" Dead men." 

Royce was excited and aroused. He was young, and had 
convictions. The laws should not be over-ridden and men 
murdered in broad daylight by these scoundrels while he was 
on the scene. He took charge of the detective, who, with his 
bruised head, was put in jail, while the liquor-seller was al 
lowed to have his illness out in his own house, one of the 
balls only having taken effect, and that in a safe place in the 
shoulder. Royce, all on fire for the side of justice, wrote and 
telegraphed for troops, using the detective's signature ; he 
went himself fifteen miles on horseback to send the dispatch, 
There were troops at the State capital ; they had been up to 
the mountains before on the same business ; they were, in 
deed, quite accustomed to going up ; but they accomplished 
nothing. The outlaws kept themselves carefully hidden in 
their wild retreats, and the village looked on as innocently as 
a Quaker settlement. A detective was fair game: two of 
them had been shot in the neighborhood within the previous 
year, and left bleeding in the road. Would they never learn, 
then, to keep out of the mountains ? 

" But is it not an extraordinary state of things that a vil 
lage so large as Ellerby should be so apathetic?" asked 
Adelaide. 

" The villagers can do little : once off the road, and you 
are in a trackless wilderness," said Stephen. " Custom makes 
law in these regions : moonlight whisky has always been 



 

made, and the mountaineers think they have a right to make 
it. They look upon the revenue-men as spies." 

" Yes ; and they are government officials and Northerners 
too," added Royce hotly " mind that ! " 

He had taken the matter in hand vigorously. He wrote 
and sent off a dozen letters per day. The Department at 
Washington had its attention decisively called to this district 
and the outlawry rampant there. It was used to it. 

In a week the troops came part of a company of infantry 
and a young lieutenant, a tall stripling fresh from West Point. 
His name was Allison ; he lisped and wore kid-gloves ; he 
was as dainty as a girl, and almost as slender. To see the 
short, red-faced, burly detective, with his bandaged head and 
stubbed fingers ; Royce, with his eagle eyes and impatient 
glance ; and this delicate-handed, pink-cheeked boy, confer 
ring together, was like a scene from a play. The detective, 
slow and cautious, studied the maps ; Royce, in a hot hurry 
about everything, paced up and down ; Allison examined his 
almond-shaped nails and hummed a tune. The detective had 
his suspicions concerning Eagle Knob ; the troops could take 
the river-road, turn off at Butter Glen, and climb the moun 
tain at that point. In the mean while all was kept quiet ; it 
was given out that the men were to search South Gap, on the 
other side of the valley. 

On the very night appointed for the start, an old lady, who 
had three granddaughters from the low country spending the 
summer with her, opened her house, lit up her candles, and 
gave a ball, with the village fiddlers for musicians and her 
old black cook's plum-cake for refreshments. Royce was to 
accompany the troops ; Adelaide had not been able to pre 
vent it. She went to Stephen in distress, and then Stephen 
proposed to Royce to send halt a dozen stout villagers in his- 
place he, Stephen, paying all expenses. 

" There are some things, Waimvright, that even your 
money can not do," replied Royce. 

" Very well," said Stephen. 




Royce now announced that they must all go to the ball to 
divert suspicion ; Allison too. But Allison had no invitation. 
Royce went to Mrs. Eliot, and begged her influence ; Mrs. 
Eliot sent Honor to the old lady, and the invitation came. 

" If he could avoid wearing his uniform " suggested 
Mrs. Eliot to Adelaide, a little nervously. 

" But he has nothing else with him, I fear," answered 
Adelaide. 

It turned out, however, that the lieutenant had a full even 
ing-suit in his valise, with white tie and white gloves also. 
Royce surveyed these habiliments and their owner with won 
der. He himself, coming from New York, with all the bag 
gage he wanted, had only a black coat. His costume must 
be necessarily of the composite order ; but the composite or 
der was well known at Ellerby. 

Allison was the belle of the ball. He danced charmingly, 
and murmured the most delightful things to all his partners 
in rapid succession. He was the only man in full evening- 
dress present, and the pink flush on his cheeks, and his tall, 
slender figure swaying around in the waltz, were long remem 
bered in Ellerby. Honor was there in a white muslin which 
had been several times washed and repaired ; there was no 
flow to her drapery, and she looked awkward. She was pale 
and silent. Mrs. Kellinger, clothed to the chin and wrists, 
with no pronounced color about her, was the one noticeable 
woman present. Royce did not dance. He found the rooms 
hot and the people tiresome ; he was in a fever to be off. 
Stephen sat on the piazza, and looked in through the window. 
At one o clock it was over. Allison had danced every dance. 
He went back to the inn with his pockets stuffed with gloves, 
withered rose-buds, knots of ribbon, and even, it was whis 
pered, a lock of golden hair. The next hour, in the deep 
darkness, the troops started. 

At five minutes before eleven the next morning, Stephen 
was bringing his algebra-lesson to a close, when a distant 
clatter in the gorge was heard, a tramping sound ; men were 





running out of the mill opposite and gazing curiously up the 
road. Honor was at the window in a flash, Stephen beside 
her. The troops were returning. They had laid hands upon 
a mountain-wagon and marched upon each side of it like a 
guard of honor. Royce sat in the wagon, his face hidden in 
his hands. 

" Where is Mr. Allison ? " said Honor, and her voice was 
but a whisper. She stood back of the curtain, trembling vio 
lently. 

Royce did not look up as the procession passed the libra 
ry ; without a word Wainwright and Honor went out, locked 
the door behind them, and followed the wagon toward the 
village. Everybody did the same ; the houses were emptied 
of their dwellers. The whole village came together to see 
the body of the boy-officer lifted out and carried into the inn. 
Allison was dead. 

The buttons on his uniform gleamed as they bore him in, 
and his white hands hung lifelessly clown. He had fought 
like a tiger, they said, and had led his men on with the most 
intrepid, daring courage to the very last. It seemed that they 
had fallen into an ambuscade, and had accomplished nothing. 
Singularly enough, the young lieutenant was the only one 
killed ; Royce was sure that he had seen one of the outlaws 
deliberately single him out and fire a dark, haggard-looking 
fellow. 

Stephen took Honor up to Adelaide's parlor. Adelaide 
was there wringing her hands. She had fastened the boy's 
collar for him at two o clock the night before, when he had 
rather absurdly pretended that he could not make it stay but 
toned ; and she had tapped him on the cheek reprovingly for 
his sentimental looks. " This ball has spoiled you, foolish 
boy," she had said; "march off into the mountains and get 
rid of this nonsense." Ah, well, he was well rid of it now ! 

Honor stood as if transfixed, listening. Presently the door 
opened, and Royce came in. " Let me get somewhere where 
I am not ashamed to cry," he said ; and, sinking down, he 



 

laid his head upon his arms on the table and cried like a child. 
Honor went out of the room hastily ; she hardly noticed that 
Stephen was with her. When she reached the ravine, she, 
too, sank down on the grass, out of sight of the house, and 
sobbed as though her heart would break. Stephen looked at 
her irresolutely, then moved away some paces, and, sitting 
down on a stump, waited. Honor had danced with Allison : 
could it be but no ; it was only the sudden horror of the 
thing. 

Allison was buried in the little village churchyard ; the 
whole country-side came to the funeral. The old Episcopal 
rector read the burial-service, and his voice shook a little as 
the young head was laid low in the deep grave. Brother 
Bethuel had come down from the mountains on Marcher, and 
had asked permission to lead the singing ; he stood by the 
grave, and, with uncovered head and uplifted eyes, sang with 
marvelous sweetness and power an old Methodist hymn, in 
which all the throng soon joined. The young girls who had 
danced at the ball sobbed aloud. Honor alone stood tearless ; 
but she had brought her choicest roses to lay over the dead 
boy's feet, where no one could see them, and she had stooped 
and kissed his icy forehead in the darkened room before he 
was carried out : Stephen saw her do it. After the funeral, 
Brother Bethuel and Honor went away together ; Stephen returned to the inn. Adelaide had taken upon herself the task 
of answering the letters. Allison had no father or mother, 
but his other relatives and friends were writing. Royce, his 
one young burst of grief over, went about sternly, his whole 
soul set on revenge. Now troops came : an officer, of the 
United States army had been killed, and the Department was 
aroused at last. There were several officers at Ellerby now, 
older men than Allison and more experienced ; a new expe 
dition was to be sent into the mountains to route these ban 
ditti and make an end of them. Royce was going as guide ; 
he knew where the former attack had been made, and he 
knew, also, the detective's reasons for suspecting Eagle Knob, 



 

the detective himself being now out of the field, owing to 
brain-fever: the United States authorities had ordered him 
out of jail, and he was at the inn, having his fever comfor 
tably on the ground-floor. Honor was with Adelaide almost 
constantly now. The elder woman, who always received her 
caressingly, seemed puzzled by the girl's peculiar manner. 
She said little, but sat and listened to every word, turning her 
dark eyes slowly from one speaker to the next. Royce came 
and went, brought in his maps, talked, and every now and then 
made the vases on the table ring as he brought down his 
strong hand with an emphasis of defiance. 

" I can not study," Honor had said to Stephen when he 
made some allusion to their morning hours. She said it sim 
ply, without excuse or disguise ; he did not ask her again. 

The expedition was to start on Monday night. The whole 
village, in the mean time, had been carefully intrusted with 
the secret that it was to go on Tuesday. But on Sunday 
evening Honor discovered that before midnight the hounds 
were to be let slip. The very soldiers themselves did not 
know it. How did the girl learn it, then ? She divined it 
from some indefinable signs in Royce. Even Adelaide did 
not suspect it ; and Stephen saw only the girl's own restless 
ness. She slipped away like a ghost so like one that Stephen 
himself did not see her go. He followed her, however, almost 
immediately ; it was too late for her to go through the village 
alone. He was some distance behind her. To his surprise, 
she did not go homeward, but walked rapidly down toward 
the river-road. There was fickle moonlight now and then ; 
he dropped still farther behind, and followed her, full of con 
jecture, which was not so much curiosity as pain. It was 
still early in the evening, yet too late for her to be out there 
on the river-road alone. This innocent young girl this child 
where, where was she going ? He let her walk on for a 
mile, and then he made up his mind that he must stop her. 
They were far beyond the houses now, and the road was 
lonely and wild ; the roar of the river over its broad, rock- 



 

dotted, uneven bed, hid the sound of his footsteps as he 
climbed up the steep bank, ran forward, and came down into 
the road in advance of her. 

" Where are you going, Miss Honor ? " he said, showing 
himself, and speaking quietly. 

She started back, and gasped out his name. 

" Yes, it is I," he answered, " Stephen Wainwright. I am 
alone ; you need not be frightened." 

She came close up to him and took his hand. 

" Do not stop me," she said entreatingly. " I am on an 
errand of life and death ! " 

" I will go in your place, Honor." 

" You can not." 

" Yes, I can. Rutyou shall not." 

" Will you betray me, then ? " she said, in an agonized 
tone. 

" No ; but you will tell me what it is, and I will go for 
you." 

" I tell you, you can not go." 

" Why ? " 

"You do not know; and, besides you would not." 

" I will do anything you ask me to do," said Stephen. 

" Anything ? " 

" Anything." 

She hesitated, looking at him. 

" Do you give me your word ? " 

"I do." 

" But but it is an enormous thing you are doing for me." 

" I know it is." 

" Oh, let me go let me go myself ! " she cried suddenly, 
with a half sob ; " it is so much better." 

" I will never let you go," said Stephen. His voice was in 
flexible. She surveyed him tremulously, hopelessly ; then sank 
down upon her knees, praying, but not to him. Stephen took 
off his hat, and waited, bareheaded. It was but a moment ; 
then she rose. " My cousin, Richard Eliot, my uncle's eldest 



 

son, has been with these men, at one of their hiding-places, 
for some months. My uncle knows nothing of it ; but Brother 
Bethuel is in the secret, and keeps watch of him." 

" Your cousin is Masters, then ? " 

" He is. Ask no more questions, but hasten on ; take the 
first broad trail which leaves the road on the right, follow it 
until you come to Brother Bethuel's house ; you can not miss 
it ; it is the only one. He will guide you to the place where 
Richard is, and you must warn him that the troops are com 
ing." 

" Only one question, Honor. Come out into the moon- 
light ; give me both your hands. Do you love this man ? " 

He looked at her fixedly. She gave a quick, strong start, 
as though she must break away from him at all hazards, and 
turned darkly red, the deep, almost painful, blush of the 
brunette. Her hands shook in his grasp, tears of shame rose 
in her eyes ; it was as though some one had struck her in the 
face. 

"Do you love this Eliot?" repeated Stephen, compelling 
her still to meet his eyes. 

She drew in her breath suddenly, and answered, with a 
rush of quick words : " No, no, no ! Not in the way you 
mean. But he is my cousin. Go ! " 

He went. Nearly two miles farther down the road the 
trail turned off ; it climbed directly up a glen by the side of a 
brook w-hich ran downward to the river in a series of little 
waterfalls. It was wide enough for a horse, and showed the 
track of Marcher's hoofs. It came out on a flank of the 
mountain and turned westward, then northward, then straight 
up again through the thick woods to a house whose light 
shone down like a beacon, and guided him. 

Wainwright knocked ; Brother Bethuel opened, started 
slightly, then recovered himself, and welcomed his guest 
effusively. 

" Is there any one in the house besides ourselves ? " said 
Stephen, ignorant as to whether there was or was not a Mrs. 



Head. There was ; but she had gone, "with her five offspring, 
to visit her mother in Tennessee. 

" Then," said Stephen, " take me immediately to Richard 
Eliot." 

The little minister stared innocently at his guest. 

" Take you where ? " he repeated, with surprised face. 

" Come," said Stephen, " you need not conceal. Miss 
Dooris herself sent me. I am to warn this Eliot that the 
troops are on the way have probably already left Ellerby." 

The little man, convinced, sprang for his lantern, lighted 
it, and hurried out, followed by Wainwright. He ran more 
than he walked ; he climbed over the rocks ; he galloped 
clown the gullies and up the other side ; he said not a word, 
but hurried, closely followed by Stephen, who was beginning 
to feel spent, until he reached the foot of a wall of rock, the 
highest ledge of Eagle Knob. Here he stood still and whistled. 
Stephen sat down, and tried to recover his breath. After a 
moment or two a whistle answered from above, and the mis 
sionary imitated the cry of a night-bird, one, two, three times. 
He then sat down beside Wainwright, and wiped his fore 
head. " He will be here in a moment," he said. In a short 
time, coming up as if from the bowels of the mountain, a 
figure stood beside them. Brother Bethuel had closed the 
slide of his lantern, and Wainwright could not see the face. 
" Miss Dooris sent me," he began. " I am to warn you that 
the troops are on their way hither to-night, and that they have 
a clew to your hiding-place." 

" Who are you ? " said the man. 

" I am Miss Dooris's messenger ; that is enough." 

The man muttered an oath. 

Brother Bethuel lifted up his hands with a deprecating 
gesture. 

" You do not mean it, Richard ; you know you do not. 
Lord, forgive him ! " he murmured. 

" Well, what am I to do ?" said the man. " Did she send 
any word ? " 



 

" Only that you must escape." 

" Escape ! Easy enough to say. But where am I to go ? 
Did she send any money ? " 

" She will," said Stephen, improvising. 

"When?" 

" To-morrow." 

" How much ? " 

" Quite a sum ; as much as you need." 

" Is she so flush, then ? " 

" She is, as you say flush," replied Stephen. 

Brother Bethuel had listened breathlessly to this conversa 
tion ; and when Eliot said, fretfully, " But where am I to go 
now to-night ? " he answered : " Home with me, Dick. I 
can conceal you for one night ; nobody suspects me. The 
Lord will forgive ; it is an Eliot." 

" Wait until I warn the fellows, then," said the man, dis 
appearing suddenly in the same way he had appeared. Then 
Stephen, who had not risen from his seat, felt a pair of arms 
thrown around his neck; the little brother was embracing 
him fervently. 

" God bless you ! God bless you ! " he whispered. " We 
will get him safely out of the country this time, with your aid, 
Mr. Wainwright. An Eliot, mind you ; a real Eliot, poor 
fellow ! " 

But the real Eliot had returned, and Brother Bethuel led 
the way down the mountain. They walked in single file, and 
Stephen saw that the man in front of him was tall and power 
ful. They reached the house, and the minister took the fugi 
tive down into his cellar, supplying him with food, but no 
light. 

" Make no sound," he said. " Even if the house is full of 
soldiers, you are safe ; no one suspects me." He closed the 
horizontal door, and then turned to Wainwright. " What are 
you going to do ? " he asked, his small face wrinkled with 
anxiety. 

" I am going back to Ellerby." 



" And when will you return with the money ? " 

" Some time to-morrow." 

" I will go with you as far as the road," said Brother 
Bethuel ; " I want to see if the troops are near." 

" Who is this Eliot ? " asked Stephen, as they went down 
the glen. 

" The Colonel's eldest son, the only child by the first wife. 
His father has heard nothing of him for several years ; it is 
the grief of the old man's life." 

" What is he doing here ? " 

"Well, he is a wild boy always was," said Brother 
Bethuel reluctantly. " Lately he has been living with a gang 
of these whisky-men." 

" And Miss Dooris knows it ? " 

" Yes. He was always fond of Honor when she was a 
child, and latterly he has has fallen into a way of depending 
upon her." 

" Why does he not come out of the woods, go to work, 
and behave like a civilized man ? " said Wainwright, in a tone 
of disgust. " I have no patience with such fellows." 

" Oh, yes, you have," said Brother Bethuel earnestly. 
" You are going to help him, you know." 

" Well, we will send him far enough away this time to 
Australia, if he will go," said Stephen. " The country will be 
well rid of him." 

" You do not, perhaps, understand exactly," said Brother 
Bethuel timidly, after a moment's silence. " Eliot fought all 
through the war fought bravely, nobly. But, when peace 
came, there seemed to be no place for him. He was not 
adapted to to commerce ; he felt it a degradation. Hence 
his present position. But he did not choose it voluntarily; 
he he drifted into it."
