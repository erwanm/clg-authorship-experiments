" Precisely, Sergeant Hapgood." 

"Now, what's the news in Pinchbrook ? '" asked the 
veteran. 

But, before Somers had a chance to tell the news from 
home, he was welcomed to the camp, and cheered, by 
officers and men ; and his account of what had trans- 
pired in Pinchbrook during his thirty-days' furlough was 
eagerly listened to by a large and attentive audience. He 
received in return a full history of the regiment during his 
absence. Though the narrative of sundry exciting events, 
such as forrays upon pig-sties, poultry-yards, and kitchen- 
gardens, was highly amusing, there was a tale of sadness 
to tell, of deaths by disease and on the battle-field. 

Many cheerful hearts, that were beating with life and 
hope a few weeks before, were now silent in the grave, 
the soldier's mausoleum in a strange land. But soldiers 
have no time to weep over a dead past ; they must live in 
the hope of a glorious future : and when they had dropped 
a tear to the memory of the noble and the true who had 
fallen on the field or died in the hospital, victims of the 
pestilential airs of the swamp, they laughed as merrily as 
ever, careless of Death's poised arrows which were always 
aimed at them. 

Captain de Banyan took his place in the regiment, 
where Somers found that he was prodigiously popular, 
even after a few hours' acquaintance with his new com- 
mand ; but who he was, where he caine from, and how 




he had procured his commission, was a mystery to offi- 
cers and men. He told tremendous stories about the 
Crimea and the Italian war ; and now, for the first time, 
intimated that he was the only survivor of the company 
which led the advance 4it the storming of Chepultepec, 
in the Mexican war. However much the officers enjoyed 
his stories, it is not probable that all of them believed 
what they heard. 

Lieutenant Somers was perfectly familiar with the 
company and battalion drill ; and, having quick percep- 
tion and abundant self-possession, he was competent at 
once to perform his duties as an officer. He had no vices 
to be criticised by the men, who respected him not only 
for his bravery on the battle-field, but for his good moral 
character ; for even the vicious respect the virtues which 
they practically cantemn. Being neither arbitrary nor 
tyrannical, he was cheerfully obeyed ; and his company 
never appeared better than when, by the temporary 
absence of his superior, it was under his command. 

He was, however, allowed but a short time to become 
acquainted with the routine of the new duty before he 
was summoned to participate in those tremendous events 
which have passed into history as at once the most bril- 
liant and disastrous operations of the war ; brilliant in 
that our gallant army was almost invariably victorious, 
disastrous in that they were the forerunners of the ulti- 
mate iaiiure of a hopeful campaign. The victory at 



 

Fair Oaks had raised the hopes of that brave, thinking 
army. 

The picket-lines were within a few miles of Richmond, 
and the soldiers were burning with enthusiasm to be led 
against the enemy in front of them. They were ready 
to lay down their lives on the altar of their bleeding 
country, if the survivors could grasp the boon of peace 
within the buttressed walls of the rebel capital, peace 
that would hurl to the ground the defiant traitors, and 
insure the safety and perpetuity of free institutions. The 
notes of victory, those thinking soldiers believed, would 
reverberate through the coming ages, and point an epoch 
from which America would date her grandest and most 
sublime triumphs. 

But not then was the great Rebellion to be overthrown : 
for not yet had the leaven of Liberty leavened the whole 
lump ; not yet had the purposes of a mysterious Provi- 
dence been accomplished ; and the brave men who sighed 
for victory and peace in the swamps of the Chickahom- 
iny were doomed to years of blood and toil, of victory 
and defeat, as they marched on, alike through both, to 
the consummation of a nation's glorious triumph, not 
over paltry armies of arrogant traitors, but over the 
incarnation of Evil, over Heaven-defying institutions, 
whose downfall established forever principles as eternal 
as God himself. 

Lieutenant Sorners was filled with the spirit of the 



 

army. He felt that the salvation of his country de- 
pended upon the valor of that army; and, impressed with 
the magnitude of the interests at stake, he was resolved 
to do his whole duty. With cheerful alacrity he obeyed 
the -summons which brought Grover's brigade into line 
of battle on the morning of the eventful 25th of June. 
What was to be accomplished was not for him to know ; 
but forward moved the line through the swamp, through 
the woods, through the pools of stagnant waters up to 
the hips of the soldiers. 

Impressed by the responsibility of his position, Lieu- 
tenant Somers encouraged the weak as they struggled 
through the mire on their trying march, and with fit 
words stimulated the enthusiasm oV all. After a march 
of about a mile, a heavy skirmish-line was thrown out, 
which soon confronted that of the rebels. 

" Now, Somers, my dear fellow, the concert is about 
to open," said Captain de Banyan. "By the way, my 
boy, this reminds me of Magenta, where " 

" Oh, confound Magenta ! " exclaimed Somers. 

" Why, my dear fellow, you are as petulant as a belle 
that has lost her beau." 

" You don't propose to tell us a story about Magenta 
at such a time as this, do you?" 

" Well, I confess I have a weakness in that direction. 
Magenta was a great battle. But I'm afraid you are a 
little nervous," laughed the captain. 




" Nervous? Do YOU think I'm a coward?" d 
Somers. 

'' I know you are not ; but you might be a little ner 
vons for all that." 

At that instant, the sharp crack of a single rifle wo, 
heard, and Somers observed a slight jerk in the brin- 
of the captain's felt hat. 

" Bravo ! " exclaimed Captain de Banyan as he too, 
off his hat, and pointed to a hole through which the rifle- 
ball had sped its way. t; I'll bet a month's pay that 
fellow couldn't do that again without making a hole 
through my head. But that's a singular coincidence. 
That's precisely the place where the first bullet went 
through my hat at Solferiuo. At Magenta ah! I see 
him," added the captain, as he took a musket from the 
hands of one of his men. k> I'll bet another mouth's pay 
that reb has fired his last shot." 

As he spoke, he raised the gun to his shoulder, and 
fired up into one of the trees. A crashing of boughs, a 
rattling of leaves, followed ; and a heavy body was heard 
to strike the ground. 

" You owe me a month's pay, Somers," continued 
Captain de Banyan, as he handed the musket back to 
the soldier. 

" I think not," replied the lieutenant, trying to be as 
cool as his companion. " I never bet." 

" Just so. I forgot that you were an exceedingly 
proper young man." 




The tikiruiiJiJme, which had paused a moment for an 
observation to be taken, now moved forward again. The 
rebel skirmishers were discovered, and the order was 
given to fire at will. The enemy's sharpshooters were 
posted in the trees, and they began to pour in a galling 
fire upon a portion of the line. 

" Steady, my men ! " said Seiners, when the firing com- 
menced. " Gunpowder's expensive : don't waste it." 

" Not a single grain of it, Leftenant Somers," added 
Sergeant Ilapgood. 

"There, uncle! up in that tree ! ' : said Somers, 
pointing to a grayback, who was loading his rifle, 
about twenty feet from the ground. 

" I see him ! " replied the sergeant as he levelled his 
piece, and fired. 

The rebel was wounded, but he did not come down ; 
and the captain of the company ordered his men to move 
forward. From the thunder of the artillery and the rattle 
of musketry, it was evident that heavy work was in prog- 
ress on the right and left. 

" Forward, men ! " said Somers, repeating the order 
of Captain Benson. 

The men were scattered along an irregular line, and 
firing into the bushes, which partially concealed the rebel 
skirmishers. Somers's platoon advanced a little moi-e 
rapidly than the rest of the line, being favored with a 
few rods of dry ground. He had urged them forward for 




the purpose of dislodging three sharpshooters perched 
in a large tree. 

" Conie down, rebs ! " shouted Somers, as he reached 
the foot of the tree, and told half a dozen of his men to 
point their guns towards them. 

" What d'yer say, Yank? " demanded one of them. 

"Will you come down head first, or feet first? Take 
your choice quick ! " replied the lieutenant. 

" As you seem to be in arnest, we'll come down the 
nateral way." 

They did come down without a more pressing invita- 
tion, and were disarmed, ready to be sent to the rear. 



 



CHAPTER VI. 



THE REBEL SHARPSHOOTERS. 



SOMERS, I don't think I can 

stand it much longer," said Phineas Deane, a 
Army private, who had joined the regiment a few 
days before the battle, as lie saluted his 
officer. 

"Can't stand what?" 

" The fact on't is, lieutenant, I'm sick. I haven't 
felt well for two or three days. I come out here to fight 
for my country, and I want to do some good. I might 
help take them prisoners back, if you say so." 

" Sick, are you? What's the matter?" 

" I've got a bad pain in the bowels," replied Phineas, 
as he placed himself on the right side of a tree, and 
glanced uneasily in the direction of the rebel skirmish 
line. "I'm subject to sich turns, but allus git over 'em 
if I have a chance to lay down for a few hours." 

" Oh, well, you can lie down here ! " added Somers. 
who understood the case pretty well. 

"What! down here in the mud and water? Wai, 




that would be rather steep for a sick man," said Phineas, 
with a ghastly smile, as he glanced again towards the 
enemy. 

" I will get some medicine for you. Here, uncle, let 
me have one of your powders," continued the lieutenant, 
addressing old Hapgood. 

" Sartiu : they've done me heaps of good, and I'm 
sure they're just the thing for that man." 

Somers took one of the powders, and opened the 
paper. 

" Now, my man, open your mouth, and let me give 
you this medicine," he added. 

"What kind of medicine is it?" 

" It'll make you kinder sick to the stomach ; but it'll 
cure you in less'n half an hour." 

" Well, lieutenant, I don't know as I want to take any 
medicine," answered poor Phineas, who was not prepared 
for this active treatment ; though he would have taken it 
quick enough if he could be sent to the rear. I guess I 
don't keer about takin' on it." 

"You needn't, if you don't want to get well." 

" I only want to go back to camp, and lay down for a 
spell." 

" We can't spare you just yet, Phineas ; but, if you 
don't stir yourself, you will lie down here somewhere, 
and never get up again," added Somers, as a shower 
of bullets passed over their heads. "Forward, boys!" 



 

The captain detailed a couple of men to conduct the 
prisoners to the rear, and the company pressed forward. 
The rebel sharpshooters were dislodged from the trees ; a 
few prisoners were captured : but the heavy fighting and 
the heavy losses fell upon other portions of the line. 
The rebels had been forced back, and the movement 
seemed to be a success. Half the regiment moved out 
of the woods, while the rest remained under the trees ; 
when a halt was ordered. Somers found himself near an 
old house, behind which a number of rebel sharpshooters 
had concealed themselves for the purpose of picking off 
the Union soldiers. 

The firing in the immediate vicinity had diminished, 
though the din of battle resounded on both sides. The 
boys were rather nervous, as men are when standing idle 
under fire ; but it was the nervousness of restrained 
enthusiasm, not of fear, unless it was in the case of in- 
valid Phineas, and a very few others whose physical 
health had not been completely established. 

"Well, Somers, my dear boy, how do you get on?" 
asked Captain de Banyan, as he sauntered leisurely up to 
the lieutenant, whose command stood next to his own. 

" First-rate ; only I should like to have., something a 
little more active than standing here." 

"It takes considerable experience to enable a man to 

stand still under fire. "When I was at the battle of Alma, 

I learned that lesson to a charm. We stood up for forty- 
two hours under a fierce fire of grape and canister, to 
say nothing of musketry." 

" Forty-two hours ! " exclaimed Somers. " I should 
think you would all have been killed off before that 
time." 

" In our regiment, only one man was killed ; and he 
got asleep, and walked in his dreams over towards, the 
enemy's line." 

" Captain, you can tell a bigger story than any other 
man in the army," said Somers, laughing. 

" That's because I have seen more of the world. 
When you have been about as much as I have, you will 
know more about it." 

" No doubt of it." 

" I should be very happy to be more actively employed 
just now ; but I am very well contented where I am." 

The position they occupied enabled the two officers to 
see some sharp fighting along the line. Through an 
opening at the right, they saw a rebel regiment, wearing 
white jackets, or else stripped to their shirts, march at 
double-quick, in splendid order, with arms at " right 
shoulder shift," to the scene of action. It was probably 
some volunteering body from Richmond, whom the ladies of 
the rebel capital had just dismissed, with sweet benedic- 
tions, to sweep the " foul Yankees " from the face of the 
earth. They were certainly a splendid body of men ; and 
the ladies might well be proud of them. They went into 



 

the field in good style, with the blessings of the fair still 
lingering fondly in their ears. But one volley from the 
veterans of the Army of the Potomac was enough for 
them, and they gave way, running off the field in wild 
disorder, threading their way in terror through the bushes, 
every man for himself. It is not likely that they were 
welcomed back from the gory field by the frothy feminine 
rebels of Richmond. 

" That's just the way the Russians ran at Palestro ! " 
exclaimed Captain de Banyan, as he watched the exciting 
scene. 

" The Russians at Palestro ! " added Somers. " I think 
you have got things a little mixed, captain." 

Before this difficult question could be settled, Captain 
de Banyan was ordered to take a sufficient force, and 
drive out the rebels who were skulking behind the old 
house. 

" Somers, you shall go with me," said he, when he 
had received his orders from the colonel. "We'll do a 
big thing, if there is any chance." 

" I am ready for any thing, big or little, captain," re- 
plied Somers heartily. " What shall I do?" 

" March your men over by that little knoll, and come 
round on the other side of the house ; I will move up in 
another direction, and we will bag the whole squad. 
But mind you, Somers, the enemy are round that way : 
don't let them gobble you up or lay you out." 



 

" I will do the best I can, captain." 

" Angels could no more." 

The lieutenant advanced, with the men detailed for 
the purpose, towards the hillock. By taking a circuitous 
route, he avoided the observation of the -rebels behind 
the house, and reached the other side of the knoll, where, 
behind the friendly shelter of a clump of bushes, he was 
enabled to survey the ground. Not more than a quarter 
of a mile distant, he discovered the rebel breastworks. It 
was about the same distance to the house. 

Between the knoll aud the house there was a small 
patch of wheat, which, by some chance, had escaped the 
havoc of foraging parties. Though the grain was not 
full-grown, it would afford concealment to his men. In 
order to reach it, he must expose his men to a volley 
from the rifle-pits, or from any body of rebels which 
might be posted in the vicinity. He could not afford to 
lose a single man, and he was preplexed to determine 
how he should overcome the distance between the wheat- 
field and the knoll. 

It seemed to him very singular that he had not already 
been fired upon ; and he concluded that it was because his 
party had been mistaken for rebels, or because some 
of their troops were between him and the Union lines. 
Whether the enemy had been deceived or not, he was 
fully determined to afford them no further information in 
regard to his politics, if any of them had seen him. He 



 

therefore ordered his men to take off their coats, which 
some of them had done before they started on the expe- 
dition. The blue trousers could not be so easily disposed 
of; but as some of the boys had straw hats, some felt, 
and some caps, it would have been hard to determine 
what they were at the distance of a quarter of a mile, 
especially as some of the Confederates wore the plun- 
dered clothing of the Union army 

After instructing his force in regard to their future 
conduct, he marched them boldly into the open space. 
To assist the deception, he directed one of his men to 
halt occasionally, and point his musket in the direction 
of the Union pickets. Not a shot was fired at them ; and, 
when the young lieutenant reached the wheat-field, he 
fancied that he was clever enough for anv brigadier in 


the rebel army. 

It was desirable that the rebel sharpshooters at the 
house should not be alarmed ; and, when his men reached 
the grain, Somers ordered them to get down upon their 
hands and knees, and creep cautiously towards the point 
to be assailed. The lieutenant, like a good officer, led 
the way himself, and had advanced about half the dis- 
tance to be accomplished, when he heard a rustling noise 
in the grain before him. It was an ominous sound, and 
he paused to take an observation. He could not see any 
thing without standing up ; and, as he was -within twenty 
rods of the house, it was necessary to avoid exposing 
himself. 



 

From whatever source the sounds proceeded, it was 
just as safe to advance as it was to retreat ; and lie 
decided to go forward. With the utmost caution, he con- 
tinued to creep along through the wheat ; but he was 
careful to assure himself that his men's muskets and his 
own revolver were in condition for instant use. After he 
had gone a few rods farther, the sounds were more 
apparent ; and, with no little consternation, he heard 
voices, rich with an unmistakable Southern accent. 

" I tell you, more of our fellers is coming through the 
grain. You mought hear 'em, ef you weren't deafer'n 
a dead nigger.' 



"I heerd 'em. You kin bet yer life they're some of our 
pickets. Howsomever, I'm gwine to see." 

" Hush, my men ! don't speak a word ! " whispered the 
young lieutenant. " Lie flat on the ground." 

The rebels were nearer than he had supposed ; for, as 
he turned from his men, he discovered a wiry grayback, 
with the chevron of a sergeant on his arms, frying to 
stare him out of countenance. The fellow did not look 
wholesome ; and Somers was in doubt whether to blow his 
brains out, or let things take their natural course. 

"Who mought you be?" demanded the grayback, ex- 
hibiting more of curiosity than of fear in his dirty face. 

" One of the people," replied Somers, disposed to 
avoid a direct issue. "Who are you?" 

I'm one of the people too," grinned the rebel. 




"I see you are ; and I suppose you belong to the army, 
don't you?" 

" Bet yer life I do." 

" Of course you 'won't object to telling me which army 
you belong to, as there may be some difference of opinion 
between vis." 

" 'Taint no use to ask a officer dressed in blue, and 
lookin' as spruce as you be, whar he kim from. I say, 
Yank, what are your uns doin' in hyar?" 

" Only taking a look." 

" You're as civil as a Mobile daucin'-rnaster ; and I 
axes yer, very perlite, to surrender." 

" How many men have you got, reb ? " demanded the 
lieutenant, as he put his hand on his revolver. 

" See hyar, Yank : play fair. Your uns allers cheat 
playin' poker. Don't tech yer shooter yet," replied the 
grayback coolly, as he thrust the muzzle of his gun in 
the lieutenant's face. " Two kin play at that game, and 
yC'iir wife or mine will be a lone widder quicker'n a 
coon kin wink at the moon. I've got seven men," he 
added. 

" I have twenty-three," said Somers. 

" Then yer kin whip us if yer be Yanks ; for three of 
your uns can jest lick one of our uns." 

"That's good logic. Will you surrender, or fight?" 
demanded Somers. 

" Let me count yer men. I surrender," he continued, 

after lie had stood up, and counted the Union soldiers. 
" Here's my shooter : fair play, even with Yanks." 

Leaving a guard of eight men with his prisoners when 
they were disarmed, Somers hastened forward to com- 
plete his mission. 






AN EXPEDITION IN FRONT. 

affair in the wheat-field had been conducted 
very quietly, and apparently had not attracted 
the attention of any of the rebels in the vicinity. 
During the brief parley, the thunder of the battle 
had sounded on the right and left of the parties. The 
enemy were in force in their works, and it was believed 
that there were squads of pickets in every place of con- 
cealment which the ground afforded. 

Somers was very much surprised to find that he was 
not molested, and made all possible haste to carry out 
the programme with which he had been intrusted by 
Captain de Banyan. Followed by the balance of his 
men, he crept carefully towards the house till he had 
reached the end of the grain-field. He could see about a 
dozen rebels skulking behind the building, all of them so 
intent upon getting a shot at the Union soldiers, that 
they paid no attention to the events transpiring in the 
rear of them ; probably deeming it impossible for an 
enemy tc approach in that direction. 



 

The lieutenant had but fifteen men left to execute his 
part of the scheme, and there seemed to be double that 
number of graybacks lurking in and about the house. 
Every thing depended upon his effecting the requisite 
junction with the force of the captain. As his superior 
had but a short distance to march, it was probable that 
he was already in position to support him ; and he decided 
to make the attack without permitting any delay to rob 
him of the chances of success. 

"Now, double-quick, forward!' I shouted Soniers, as 
he rose from the ground, and led the w r ay to a position 
where he could intercept the retreat of the rebels. 

Agreeably to the instructions previously given, his 
men stretched out into an extended line, and commenced 
firing at will upon the luckless graybacks who were in 
sight. It did not take them long to find out that they 
were assailed by a fire in the rear. 

" Surrender ! " shouted Captain de Banyan, who at this 
moment appeared a.t the head of his men. 

The rebels were not disposed to accept this polite invi- 
tation, but began to fall back from the house in good 
order. They discharged their pieces at the force in front, 
and then started at a run to effect their escape in the 
opposite direction. They forgot for the moment that they 
had been fired upon from the rear, or else thought that 
the fire had been directed by some of their own people at 
the Yankees who had so suddenly attacked in front. 



 

" Surrender ! " shouted Lieutenant Somers, as the re- 
treating rebels approached his line. 

They halted at this unexpected summons. ' The officer 
in command of them took a hasty survey of the situation, 
and then ordered his troops to cut their way through the 
thin line between them and the rebel field-works. The 
commander of the rebel pickets was a gallant fellow ; and, 
drawing his sword, he rushed towards the spot where the 
lieutenant was stationed. Discharging his pistol with 
the left hand at Somers, he dashed forward like d, restive 
horse. 

Both parties had discharged their guns, and there was 
no time to reload them. Some of the rebels had bayonets, 
and some had not ; and, with the fury of their brave 
leader, they attempted to break their way through the line. 
A sharp but very irregular conflict ensued, the rebels club- 
bing their muskets or grappling with the Union soldiers, 
each according to his individual taste. As they were two 
to one of the Federals, they would certainly have won the 
fielc\ if Captain de Banyan had not promptly come to the 
rescue. 

The excited rebel officer manifested a most persistent 
desire to revenge his misfortunes upon Lieutenant Somers. 
After he had fired his pistol twice, and one of the balls 
had passed through his opponent's cap, the latter, by a 
sudden dash, knocked the weapon from his hand with his 
sword. He then attempted to use his own sword, and, if 



 

Somers had not been a "master of fence," would prob- 
ably have run him through the body. Some hard blows 
were struck with these weapons, and the age of chivalry, 
when men fought hand to hand with trusty blades, 
seemed to be revived. But the sword of the rebel officer 
was not so trusty as it ought to have been. It was not a 
regulation sword ; and, while its owner was flourishing it 
most valiantly, the blade flew away from the handle. 

" Now surrender ! " said Somers, out of breath with 
the violence of his exertions, as he drew from his belt 
the pistol which, being so hard pressed, he had not been 
able to use before. 

" Never, sir ! I don't surrender ! I was sent here to 
fight, and not to surrender," replied the officer, as proudly 
as though he had been in command of a beleaguered for- 
tress, instead of a squad of two or three dozen men. 

Somers had him at his mercy, and it seemed but little 
better than murder to shoot him in his defenceless 
state. 

That was a bad mistake on his part ; for the rebel 
officer at once proceeded to prove that he was no effemi- 
nate character, who depended upon a sword, pistol, or 
other weapon, to fight his battles with, but could, if 
occasion required, defend himself with his naked arm. 
He sprang upon Somers with the ferocity of a tiger. The 
latter fired ; but the sudden movement of the former im- 
paired his aim, and the ball whistled harmlessly over- the 




head of the rebel. The desperate officer attempted to 
gain possession of the pistol ; but Somers, now thoroughly 
aroused to a sense of his own danger, sprang at the 
throat of his antagonist, and, by the fierceness of the dash, 
bore him to the earth. His victim struggled to escape ; 
and, being a stronger man than the other, would certainly 
have succeeded, if Somers had not picked up his pistol, 
which lay on the spot where they fell, and struck a blow 
with the but of it on the temple of the rebel. This 
effectually quieted him ; but the lieutenant's little force 
were falling back before the furious assaults of the gray- 
backs. 

He had only time to get up before the rebels were upon 
him. At this interesting and critical moment, Captain 
de Banyan came up with his large force ; and the enemy, 
finding themselves pressed in front and rear, gave up in 
despair. They were disarmed ; and, those from the wheat- 
field being brought forward, the whole squad were 
marched in the direction of the Union line. 

About one-half of Somers's men were wounded, though 
some but slightly. These were sent back. The rebel 
officer lay insensible upon the ground ; but Somers, satis- 
fied that he was only stunned, desired to carry him off, 
not only as a trophy of his prowess, but because such a 
desperate fellow w r ould be less dangerous in a prison- 
camp than in the lines of the rebels. He directed two 
of his men to bear the insensible form to the house, 



 

whither they were followed by the remainder of the 
force. 

" Somers, my dear fellow, give me your hand," said 
Captain de Banyan, as soon as the pressing business of 
the moment had been disposed of. " You have covered 
yourself with glory." 

" Pooh ! ' : replied Somers, trying to look indifferent. 
" I have only done my duty, and obeyed my orders." 

"That's very true ; but, if you had been weak in the 
knees, you couldn't very well have obeyed orders. 
Somers, you have done a big thing ; and, in my judg- 
ment, you ought to be promoted." 

"Promoted for that?" 

" In the battle of Magenta" 

" Oh, confound the battle of Magenta ! ' exclaimed 
Somers, interrupting him : " I will give you a handsome 
present if you will never say Magenta to me again." 

" Don't be petulant, my dear boy ! You have got a 
sweet temper naturally, and I hope you won't spoil it." 

" I am afraid you will spoil it for me." 

" I was only saying pleasant things to you, and you fly 
off and roll yourself up in your dignity like a little hedge- 
hog. By the way, Somers, don't you suppose that Sena- 
tor Guilford will hear of this affair?" 

" I hope not," 

" Nor that little lady we left all used up with a broken 
arm?" 




" I don't care whether she does or not." 

" Or that other little lady who knits socks for soldiers 
that don't run away in battle ? " 

Somers blushed like a maiden, and his experienced 
companion saw that he had touched the tender spot in 
his heart. Very likely the captain would have said some- 
thing more on this interesting subject., if the conversation 
had not been interrupted by their arrival at the old 
house. Here they were met by a messenger from the 
colonel, ordering the detachment to hasten back ; for 
orders had come for the brigade to retire to their old 
position. 

The wounded and the prisoners were conducted safely 
back to the line in the woods, where our party were 
warmly congratulated upon their decided success. The 
brigade fell back, but were immediately ordered forward 
again, and held the advance position which had been so 
gallantly won. It was not a very comfortable place ; for 
the soldiers stood over shoes in the water. Late in the 
evening, our regiment was relieved by another, and 

ordered back to the breastworks in the rear. It had 

lost but few men, though torrents of loyal blood had 

flowed on that eventful day. 



The action of that day was the initial conflict of the 
Seven-days' Battles. General McClellan actually com- 
menced his long-deferred operations against the city of 
Richmond- But the favorable moment had passed by, 



 

and even then the battalions of the rebels were gathering 
in readiness to be hurled upon our devoted army. While 
the regiment, whose fortunes having been more intimately 
connected with our story, was retiring from the pestiferous 
swamp, the commanding general received information 
of the approach of Stonewall Jackson. These proved to 
be sad tidings ; for the anticipated triumphal march into 
the rebel capital was changed into a bloody but glorious 
retreat. The battles which were to be fought for a victo- 
rious advance were made to cover a disastrous defeat, 
disastrous to the campaign, though not to the arncry. 

Fatigued, hungry, and chilled by the night damps of 
the swamp, the regiment threaded its way through the 
intricacies of the woods towards the breastworks in the 
rear. It was a dark and gloomy hour, though the pres- 
tige of victory dwelt in the souls of the gallant soldiers. 
The officers were not familiar with the ground ; and with 
difficulty they found their way back to the old line. 

" Well, Somers, how do you feel?" asked Captain de 
Banyan when the regiment was dismissed. 

" I'm all worn out. I haven't got toughened to this 
kind of work yet," replied Somers. 

" Don't give it up yet, my boy. "We shall be in Rich- 
mond in less than a week, and then we will take rooms 
at the Spottswood House, and have a good time." 

" Do you believe we shall ever get into Richmond, 
captain ? " 



 

" Certainly I do. Every thing is working to my entire 
satisfaction. You feel a little blue, my boy ; but it is only 
because you are tired. You will feel better in the morning." 

" I am tired, but I am not blue. I am ready to do my 
duty, in victory or defeat. There has been an awful roar 
of guns all day, and no one can tell what the result of a 
battle will be." 

" ' An awful roar of guns ' ! 'Pon my word, I like that," 
laughed the captain. " Why, at Magenta" 

" Magenta again ! " sneered Somers, who w r as heartily 
sick of that word. 

" Yes, at Magenta ! If you could only have heard the 
guns there ! Why, there were seven thousand two hun- 
dred and forty-six pieces rattling away like mad on our 
side alone ; and I believe the Russians " 

" Russians at Magenta again ! I don't believe you 
were at the battle of Magenta any more than I was ! " 
exclaimed Somers desperately. 

" Do you mean to tell me that I lie?" asked the cap- 
tain gravely. 

"Go on with your story," said the lieutenant, fearing 
that he had said too much. 

" Answer my question, if you please. You gave me 
the lie ; did you not ? " 

" No : I didn't use that word." 

" You said you didn't believe I was at the battle of 
Magenta." 



 

"To be perfectly candid with you, I don't believe it; 
but I am tired, and want my supper," answered Somers, 
wishing to escape the issue which he had provoked. 

" Fair play, my boy. You charged me with lying, 
indirectly, but not the less offensively on that account. 
Don't dodge the question." 

" I haven't dodged it. I gave you my candid opinion 
that you were not present at Magenta ; and I don't think 
there is an officer in the regiment who believes you were 
there." 

"Isn't the word of an officer and a gentleman to be 
accepted?" 

" Certainly, if he keep within the bounds of reason ; 
but when you talk about the Russians at Magenta, and 
over seven thousand cannons in a single army, we know 
that you are either drawing the long-bow,' or laboring 
under some strange delusion. Supper is ready." 

" AVe can eat and talk too." And they did. " May I 
be allowed to ask, Lieutenant Somers, if you deem my 
statement inconsistent with reason?" 

"To be sure I do. "We have six guns to a battery : 
seventy-two hundred guns would make twelve hundred 
batteries. "We have about one hundred and fiftv men to 


a battery, which would make one hundred and eighty 
thousand men in the artillery arm alone ; which is posi- 
tively ridiculous. You said Russians " 

"Of course, that was a slip of the tongue, I meant 




Prussians," added the captain, entirely overwhelmed by 
the lieutenant's arithmetic, as well as by the laughter of 
Captain Benson and Lieutenant Munroe, who belonged 
to the mess. 

"Worse yet," said Somers. "They were Austrians. 
Now, captain, you are a brave man, and a splendid fel- 
low ; but I think it is a great pity you should tell such 
abominably great stories." 

" I accept the apology," laughed Captain de Banyan. 
" "We will call it square, and turn in ; for I think that 
we shall have hot work to-morrow." 



 




CHAPTER VIII. 

AN ORDER FROM HEADQUARTERS. 

WHILE Captain cle Banyan and Lieutenant 
Soniers were asleep, the commanding gen- 
eral received intelligence of a movement on 
our right by the famous Stonewall Jackson. 
The position which had been gained by the advance at 
Oak Grove was abandoned, and the troops returned to
