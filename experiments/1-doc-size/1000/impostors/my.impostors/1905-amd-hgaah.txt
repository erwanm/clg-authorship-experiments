Her friend, Mrs. Howard, was in the Adiron- 
dacks nursing her husband through the fluctua- 
tions of his disease. There appeared little chance 
of his recovery. 

It seemed to Helen that she must have been 
away a much longer time, judging from her own 
experiences, and yet there were very few changes. 
There were the same stores, the same pictur- 
esquely shaded streets, some of the houses re- 
joicing in a new coat of paint, others shabby. 
She recalled the Saturday so long ago that she 
had been sent over to shop and all the events 
that had grown out of it. 

She met Mr. Walters, who greeted her delight- 
edly. His book had created considerable interest 
from the advance sheets, and orders were coming 
in. His pride and joy were really infectious. 

"It will owe much of its success to you and 
your father. I do believe I should only have 
dreamed over it all the rest of my life, but your 
vigor inspired me," he declared. 

Helen's eyes sparkled with delight. Mrs. 
Walters was overjoyed to see her. 

"I do believe husband has gone back a good 



 

half dozen years," she said. "Don't you notice 
how bright and young he looks? His journey 
last winter did him a world of good and roused 
him up. And that book has been a powerful 
tonic." 

Mrs. Dayton had aged a little but was as warm- 
hearted as ever. There were only a few board- 
ers, old friends. 

"I could have had a houseful but I thought I 
wouldn't bother. There's no one for me to make 
money and lay up for, though cousins to the 
tenth degree are ready enough to lay claim to 
the little you leave behind." 

Mr. Warfield had gone away the day before 
her return, and on Saturday had sailed for 
Europe. 

"I think he ought to pick up some nice wife 
to keep him from growing queerer. He isn't 
half as bright and jolly as he used to be, but I 
do suppose the big boys are trying." 

"And the girls might be, too," laughed Helen. 

Mr. Wilmarth had made all arrangements for 
the summering. The cottage was on the great 
South Bay on Long Island. Some acquaintances 
had gone there, so they really would not be lone- 
some. There was a man to do the rough work 
and care for the horse, and Mrs. Wilmarth would 





take their own servant. The cottage was fairly 
well furnished, and a piano had been hired. 
Everything was ready for them to go in and take 
possession. 

"I have been so afraid something would hap- 
pen to change your mind," Mrs. Wilmarth de- 
clared with her affectionate greeting. "It does 
seem hard to take you away from Mrs. Dayton, 
and I expect your aunt will think me as much 
of an evil genius as Mrs. Van Dorn. But if I 
couldn't have had you I do believe I should have 
given up the struggle, though the doctor insists 
that I am better." 

"And you certainly do look improved," re- 
turned the young girl eagerly. 

"I didn't want to look ungrateful when you 
are going to be so good as to devote the next 
ten weeks to me. But I wish— oh, Helen, what 
fascination is there about college life for you 
young girls? I'd like you to be my girl instead. 
I could provide for you — " 

"You are all so good to me. I wonder if ever 
any girl found so many friends ?" 

"You deserve them all. I think you win them 
yourself," and the tender tone touched her. 

Helen smiled with luminous eyes. 

Miss Craven was to stay with Mrs. Wilmarth 



 

while Helen went to her aunt's, that they might 
get used to each other, the girl said laughingly. 

They were all so glad to see her that Helen's 
heart almost failed her though she had explained 
her plans by letter some time before. Uncle 
Jason greeted her with such fatherly love that it 
fairly melted her heart. Aunt Jane was distinctly 
captious, yet she could not hide her interest and 
affection. Nat was full of joy and had so many 
improvements to explain to her. Joe Northrup, 
he admitted, gave him good suggestions. 

"We're going to be the two best farmers any- 
where around here!" he exclaimed with pride. 
"There's no sense in folks dropping down so and 
saying there isn't money in this or that. Half 
the men are too lazy to dig up the money. 
Father's mighty pleased, I can tell you. I don't 
believe the Cummings blood had all the virtues ;" 
and he laughed with a joyous ring. 

He was getting to be quite fine and intelligent- 
looking. Education did make a difference. 

The younger children were doing well. Aurelia 
had grown prettier, but otherwise she seemed a 
hopeless case. 

Jenny and Joe Northrup were prospering. 
Baby Helen was good-natured and smiled at the 





slightest encouragement, while little Joe was a 
sturdy boy. 

Aunt Jane made the same old lament, that it 
was very hard Helen could go about everywhere 
and never have any time for her own folks, who 
had looked after her when there was no one 
else to lend a hand. And she didn't see any 
sense in spending money and years over book 
learning when one knew enough to get along in 
the world. And most women who had a chance 
married, and what they needed to know most of 
all was housekeeping and that you couldn't get 
out of books. 

"But they are writing books on the best meth- 
ods of housekeeping," declared Helen in a bright, 
gay tone. "And in the cities they are teaching 
it to the poor women who have had to work in 
shops and factories all their young lives." 

"Jenny worked in a shop and I'll risk any one 
finding a better housekeeper if they'd studied a 
thousand books !" was the decisive answer. 

There was no use arguing. Aunt Jane would 
be "set in her ways" and beliefs to the end of the 
chapter. 

Helen wondered if it was quite fair to turn 
from these olden friends to newer, more delight- 
ful ways! For she did find more pleasure in 



 

them, more satisfaction. She was different from 
most of the girls she saw plainly. Now the talk 
ran largely on beaux and fun and how gowns 
were to be made, and oh, how glad half a dozen 
of them were that they had graduated and there 
was no more tiresome old school. Westchester 
was on a much higher intellectual plane. Mrs. 
Wilmarth sighed a little about it. 

But there was no changing of the plan, and 
when Helen's visits were finished she said good- 
bye with a lingering touch of sadness. 

"Do not think me ungrateful — " her arms were 
around Mrs. Dayton's neck. "All the good 
things of my life had their start here with you, 
and I do sometimes feel as if I ought to stay and 
be your daughter." 

There was a glitter of tears on her bronze 
lashes and the lines about her mouth had a tempt- 
ing indecision. 

"I wish you werCy Helen. I've wished it a 
good many times. But then you see you would 
be a different kind of girl. I think you have 
some of your father's qualities or you wouldn't 
have so much vigor and spirit and desire for 
knowledge. Then I see Uncle Jason's cheerful- 
ness in you and your present enjoyment of things 
that keeps you bright and happy. And I do sup- 




pose if this had not been just the career marked 
out by Providence for you it would not have 
shaped that way — " 

Helen laughed as she interrupted. "But you 
know I would have come over here and worked 
for a home just for the chance of the high school. 
And I meant to work my way through college. 
O dear! What dreams I had! And I do owe 
a good deal to Mr. Warfield. I shall always feel 
grateful that he roused my dormant faculties." 

"He cares a great deal for you, Helen." The 
girl flushed warmly. 

"Oh, good-bye," she cried, "and I will write 
to you every week." 

It was a very pleasant if tiresome journey to 
Mrs. Wilmarth. Her husband was on the look- 
out that everything should be made as easy as 
possible and the two girls were devoted to her, 
catching up a bit of brightness or amusement. 
Helen saw so many things that somehow were 
tinted and textured by her fairy wand, as Mr. 
Wilmarth called her cheerfulness. 

After they left the train there was a drive. 
Mr. Wilmarth disdained the stage and took the 
rather shabby rockaway. "Drive round by the 
bay," he said. 

They passed the main street on which there 



 

were two hotels and several really fine houses. 
A quarter of a mile perhaps and then they were 
on the beach road with the bay spread out before 
them, the narrow strip of sand that half enclosed 
it and the broad, glittering ocean that met the 
sky line and was lost in the commingling of tints. 
The air came up with a full strong breath of 
glorious life gathered from the boundless space. 

"It is magnificent and solemn, changing and 
yet with a sense of immutability. Think of the 
hundreds of years it has ebbed and flowed just 
that way, touching the sky only to mortal ken, so 
near yet never meeting or greeting it." 

Helen drew a long breath of rapture. Mrs. 
Wilmarth smiled. Miss Craven had a high look 
in her eyes as if her soul was touched to the 
depths. 

"You girls can run down often," Mr. Wilmarth 
said. "Up there," nodding northward, "is a 
bathing house and a long shallow beach. And the 
drive up has many fine views, and some beautiful 
residences, as well. I wanted you to have this 
sight so that you could be satisfied in your sleep 
and your dreams. Now we will turn up, driver." 

They passed a wind-break of trees, blown quite 
awry and stunted by the salt air. This was a 
rather sandy road with houses set here and there. 





They crossed the avenue and glanced up and 
down. It was quite a pretty view. The next 
street was theirs, the house a short distance from 
the corner. It was a rambling story and a half 
affair that had been built onto in several direc- 
tions, which gave it a queer aspect. There was * 
quite a space in front with some shrubbery that 
had not done very well, or had not been cared 
for, and grassy patches where a sort of creeping 
vine had not quite smothered it But there was 
a long piazza with a seat built up against the 
house and lattices here and there over which 
mornmg glories were rioting. One door opened 
directly into the parlor, a large room with old- 
fashioned hair-cloth covered furniture, an im- 
mense sofa, and a sort of nondescript carpet that 
time had softened to a very tolerable aspect 

Katy had come down a. few days before with 
some boxes and easy chairs that had been dis- 
posed about. She gave them a warm welcome. 
Mrs. Wilmarth sank down amid the cushions 
Katy had piled on the sofa. Helen took her hat 
and drew off her gloves. 

"You are very tired," she said in her soft com- 
forting voice, toned to suit the occasion. "And 
now you are to have two maids to wait upon 



 

you, and Katy to see that everything goes straight 
and we do not starve." 

"It's very primitive, isn't it?" with a faint 
smile. "If you girls do not weary of it — " 

"Oh, we shall never tire of the glorious old 
ocean ! It is my first real sight of it. And after 
all I do not think all the Hopes are in such an 
advanced state of aesthetic culture that we shall 
miss so very much." 

"And I have been primitive all the early period 
of my life," said Juliet. "I wonder if luxuries 
really do spoil one?" 

"Not school luxuries exactly," returned Helen 
with a rather mirthful accent. "Now while you 
are resting may I indulge my curiosity in ex- 
ploring? And must we draw lots or toss up a 
penny to see where we shall bide?" 

Out of the parlor was a large sleeping room. 
The rag carpet that adorned the floor was a 
work of art and so thick that it might have been 
an oriental rug. The furnishings were enough 
to set a lover of the antique crazy. A great bed- 
stead of old mahogany with some rather quaint 
carving, a bureau large enough for a closet and 
almost as high as Helen's shoulders, another 
curious chest of drawers with a desk top, and a 
wardrobe of the same wood nearly black with 



age. Fortunately the room was large enough 
not to seem dwarfed with these belongings. 

A door opened into the adjoining room, which 
had a much more modern aspect. The curtains 
at the window were figured with pale blue vines 
and in this carpet the rags had before weaving 
been colored all the shades of blue that could be 
invented it seemed, and it was oddly pretty. This 
room as well as the parlor opened into the dining 
room, and from here there seemed innumerable 
kitchens, each one dropping a little in degree 
until back of the laundry was a woodshed. 

"It's queer enough," began Katy. "And the 
old lady's queer, too. She lives in the kitchens 
in the winter. There was a big family it seems, 
but they've mostly gone away or are dead. She 
has one married daughter living in the village 
and in the summer she hires out the house and 
lives With her, and in the winter a grandson 
comes over and lives with her. Some people 
came here in April and went out in June or Mr. 
Wilmarth wouldn't have struck it. The old lady 
doesn't see what folks want to be traveling round 
all the time for, though she admits it brings in 
money to those who have places to rent. She 
looks as if she might be a hundred, but she's 
keen, I tell you. Do you want to go up stairs? 



 

There's two rooms and a garret most stuffed full 
of things in barrels and boxes." 

The girls concluded that they would save the 
garret for the next day. Katy's kitchen was full 
of appetizing smells and she said laughingly, 
"I do hope you are good and hungry." 

"As hungry as the traditional bear. I suppose 
he made the remark after his winter's nap." 

Mr. Wilmarth had been superintending the re- 
moval of the trunks and the opening of a few 
boxes and now sat beside his wife with traces 
of solicitude in his countenance. 

"Well," and he glanced inquiringly at the girls 
as they entered the room, "how are you going to 
like it? I could have had a more modem house 
farther back, but I wanted you to be near the 
beach. It is a little queer." 

"That will serve to entertain us," said Helen. 
"And the ocean is new to us." 

"There are some fine drives about. Well, per- 
haps that isn't exactly the word," smilingly, "but 
there are some beautiful new places, estates really, 
they are on such a large scale. It is more a 
colony of homes than a boarding place, and there 
are a good many of the old settlers left, and the 
picturesque fishermen and boats break the monot- 
ony. I have a man engaged to come twice a 





week, or oftener if you want him to drive you 
about." 

Katy announced dinner. The girls did it full 
justice, but Mrs. Wilmarth was too tired for 
feasting. Afterward, Mr. Wilmarth brought the 
reclining chair out on the porch, and wrapping up 
his wife so that she might not feel any chill, they 
had an entertaining talk. Even here you could 
catch the sound of the waves tramping up on the 
beach. And how the stars shone on their back- 
ground of deepest azure. A few insects were 
chirping, and one or two odd ones were making a 
a long whir that was quite new to them. 

They were bright and rested the next morning 
and arranged their favorite belongings with the 
books they had brought, and the few photographs 
and dainty bric-a-brac. 

"There will be no room for pictures," Mrs. 
Wilmarth said. "In my experience of country 
houses people are very much attached to their 
own adornments and do not want you to disturb 
them." 

Helen made a comical face as she glanced 
about the room. There were George and Martha 
Washington, Cornwallis surrendering his sword, 
Andrew Jackson sitting on the porch at the Her- 
mitage with two really fine dogs. The capture 



 

of Major Andre, an old painting of an ancestor 
who was in the battle of Long Island, another of 
a captain lost at sea and several family photo- 
graphs. 

"We may be allowed to cover them with pale 
green net to keep off the flies and lend a kind of 
softened suggestiveness to them," said Helen. 
"Worthy as the subjects are, I should not like to 
live with them all the year round." 

Mrs. Green, the owner of the premises, came 
down to see her new tenants. She was rather 
a small person with a very shrunken appearance, 
much wrinkled and with the brown tan of years 
of seaside. Her cambric gown was extremely 
clean, her gingham sunbonnet starched very stiffly, 
and her small face seemed almost lost in it 

Entertaining she certainly was with her quaint, 
obsolete words sprinkled here and there, and her 
shrewd comments on the changes since she was a 
girl and the village was three or four large farms, 
and everybody's husband and sons were fisher- 
men, and the women and children looked after 
the out-of-door work. Her grandfather had been 
one of the old men and built the middle of the 
house, her father had added two rooms, her hus- 
band had built on some more. One of her sons 
was in Colorado, the other was mate of a vessel. 





one daughter was in Nova Scotia, where her hus- 
band was in canning business, the youngest was 
married here. They had all made the house over 
to her. "Of course they know some of 'em will 
get it back, the gals most likely. Men have ten 
chances in this world to a woman's one, an' I 
hold if there's anything to leave, 'specially if 
'taint very much, the gals ought to have it. You 
look young, mum, to have grown up daughters.'* 

"They are not mine," returned Mrs. Wilmarth. 
"I could wish they were." 

"Well, it's a great responsibility to get 'em 
married off to your likin'. Now I'd ruther Har- 
riet would 'a married Sam Baldwin who has a 
big farm ten miles or so above here and is makin' 
money hand over fist. But no one would do her 
but that Andrew Mack and to go off where no 
one could ever get at her. There ain't much to 
choose from round here — " 

"And these girls have to go back to school," 
interposed Mrs. Wilmarth. 

"Well now, I should think they'd better be 
learnin' how to keep house. Gals don't seem to 
take to work now-a-days, but they'll play with 
knocking balls into holes over there in the field 
and chase through the hot sun, and I'll be bound 
it would half kill 'em to sweep a room or cook a 



 

dinner. You can have what vegetables you want 
out of the garden, an' I hope you'll be satisfied 
and not find fault with everything. I hate fault- 
finding people. An' I'll come over again to see 
how you get along." 



CHAPTER V 

WHAT THE OCEAN SAID 

Mrs. Green trotted off abruptly. Then they 
went down to the beach. The tide was going 
out and every wave left behind sands that in 
this morning sunshine sparkled with gems of 
imagination, Helen averred. Did the waves 
carry that crest off to other lands ? The wonder- 
ful boundlessness stirred the depths of Helen's 
soul. Would she be following the mysterious 
track sometime? Life had been full of surprises 
to her, would they go on and on ? 

"The air is invigorating," Mrs. Wilmarth said. 
"People do need changes, I suppose. The quiet 
of Hope was restful at first. Oh, do you sup- 
pose I shall turn into a discontented old woman?" 

"You will have to wait a long time first, and 
even now you are going to renew your youth." 

Mrs. Wilmarth smiled. "You cannot realize 
how glad I am to have you back. Yes, I wish 
more than ever that you really belonged to me. 
And I suppose Mrs. Dayton is saying the same 
thing. I try to study out the charm." 


"Have I such a wonderful gift? I think it is 
because people need just what I can give them. 
You see their need rounds it out." 

"Or the reverse," tenderly. "They do need 
what you give so generously. The world is full 
of needs." 

"I am glad to have anything to bestow." 

The elder was thinking that while Miss Craven 
might charm witfi her exquisite playing this girl 
had the light and spirit that entered into true 
living. 

Mr. Wilmarth halted. "You must begin bath- 
ing to-morrow," he said to his wife. "I am 
anxious to see how you stand it. And I must 
look up some experienced person to watch over 
you when I am not here. Helen, you ought to 
learn to swim." 

"That would be simply glorious !" and her eyes 
sparkled while her heart beat joyfully. Juliet 
gave a shiver. 

"Would you be afraid?" he asked rather teas- 
ingly. 

"Yes, I should, I do not believe I would ever 
have the courage to cross the ocean for all the 
wonderful things on the other side. It seems to 
stretch so far, to such immeasurable distances. 
I never realized it before, but then I never saw it 





in all its majesty. No, I couldn't learn to swim. 
I do not believe I want to trust myself to it at all. 
It seems so — so stealthy." 

"And I like the far off distance. Why I should 
like to be out there where sky and ocean meet. 
Juliet, you must have waded in a brook when 
you were little ! And you have gone out on the 
river," said Helen earnestly,' almost upbraidingly. 

"But the river is so different," protested Juliet. 

"I used to like sea bathing years ago. It is 
very exhilarating. And if it will strengthen me, 
I shall be glad. You will not be afraid, Helen." 

"Oh, no, no !" clasping her friend's hand. 

They walked along the beach. It dried so 
quickly in the summer sun. Here and there was 
a boat or bathing house, but it was not a fashion 
resort. Presently they turned homeward. Helen 
had a handful of curious shells and said next 
time they would bring a basket. 

Up above a short distance there was a strip 
of woods, rather scrubby pines nearest the shore, 
but increasing in size and dignity as they crept 
inland. It almost seemed as if the island might 
end there. 

"I am glad there are some woods. And it is 
not too far for a nice walk, for me, at least," 
Helen began. 



 

"We will go over and explore it. There are 
sometimes terrible forest fires, for the wind has a 
terrific sweep. Since you are so fond of walking, 
suppose we send these delicate pilgrims home and 
I show you around the little town and where to 
find the post office. Then we will see Hiram 
Seton about the carriage. You are quite an ex- 
pert at driving, I believe." 

"I can drive an ordinary old nag," laughed 
Helen. "These heavy roads would not favor 
runaways." 

So they turned off and went along the main 
street that presently began to show a business 
aspect. There was a grocery store, a drygoods 
and millinery establishment, bakery, and several 
other suggestions of trade, quite a pretentious 
country hotel and livery, and looking east about 
a block, a small wharf and boathouse, and a 
fishing rendezvous. There was a certain lively 
air about the place. A little farther up on some 
rising ground stood a neat chapel. 

"One wouldn't care to spend his life here, 
though this really is only a little off-shoot of 
Balem proper, East Balem, not large enough for 
a name of its own. Balem is quite a town. 
Sometime, I dare say, it will be all towns and 
seaside resorts." 



"It must be rather dreary in winter. I am 
afraid I am getting spoiled even for Hope," and 
Helen gave a bright smile. 

They found the post office and a news stand. 
There were no letters as yet. Then they inter- 
viewed Hiram Seton, the landlord of the hotel, 
who promised to have the carriage over at three. 

The drive through the country was really beau- 
tiful as they went up farther toward the centre 
of the island. They passed several pretty towns. 
There were substantial farm houses and well cul- 
tivated fields ; indeed some of the market gardens 
were very attractive, kept in the neatest and most 
profitable order. 

That evening their nearest neighbor came over. 
She was a bright, wholesome-looking woman who 
had taken the training of a nurse when thrown 
on her own resources, and now had several 
semi-invalids under her care, sent from the city 
for convalescence. In fact, it was the security 
this afforded that had decided the Wilmarths in 
taking the place, since Mrs. Wilmarth did not 
feel able to endure the stress of much social life. 

Mrs. Ballinger was well informed and really 
attractive with the sort of magnetism that drew 
one gently, and was not in the least insistent. 
She spoke of some of the neighbors in a very 



 

pleasant manner far removed from invidious gos- 
sip. In the newer houses the owners never spent 
the winter. Only the old inhabitants whose busi- 
ness was here or who had been here for genera- 
tions had the courage to remain. 

"And you?" inquired Mrs. Wilmarth sugges- 
tively. 

"Oh, I generally take a short holiday, run up 
to the city to hear a little good music and see my 
friends, and have various amusements. Though 
last winter I had three patients who stayed nearly 
all January. There are some splendid views in 
winter, only the evenings are apt to grow monot- 
onous. I see you have provided music for your 
young people. There are some delightful girls 
in that large pale green house just above here, 
and they give one or two musicales or entertain- 
ments for the benefit of the chapel. That is 
Rolfe avenue, and Squire Rolfe, as he is called, 
once owned it from the woods down to the chapel. 
And he has a keen eye for the future of the 
place, for he will only allow really fine houses to 
be erected on it." 

"About the girls?" inquired Helen with a smile. 

"There are seven Travis children, little and 
big ; two daughters and one son grown up. Elsie 
Travis is engaged this summer. Jim, as they 





call him, is in college, Annie comes next, then two 
big boys, and lastly two little girls. They are 
really pleasant and unassuming. And they nearly 
always have some cousins staying with them. 
Large families find so much entertainment." 

Then they discussed the bathing. There was 
also some boating. Parties often went over on 
the opposite beach and had picnics in the after- 
noons. Or they went yachting to Fire Island 
Light and took real ocean trips. 

"The young folks will find enough to keep 
them from getting homesick then," said Mr. Wil- 
marth. "And if you will keep a little oversight 
of my wife when I am away, as I shall not be able 
to spend all the time here, I shall feel much easier 
in mind." 

Mrs. Ballinger promised cordially. 

The very next day the young people came over 
from Rolfe avenue, two Travis girls, a Miss 
Grenfell, and two young men. Mrs. Wilmarth 
was much pleased with them, and Helen affiliated 
with them at once. They had a lawn tennis 
court, and about half a mile away there were 
golf links, but Jim was the only one who pat- 
ronized them. 

"There are so many things to do," said Miss 
Elsie, "and it seems as if you came to the country 



 

in the summer to rest a little, to swing in ham- 
mocks and ready and not dissipate all the time. 
I'm fond of talking over books and pictures and 
getting other people's ideas, and I paint a little 
and practice my music and embroider. Which 
is the musician here, or are you both?" 

Helen disclaimed any great proficiency. Miss 
Travis went over to Juliet, and they soon found 
they had similar tastes. She was charming, too, 
to Mrs. Wilmarth, and invited them all up to 
afternoon tea, which they often had on the large 
piazza. They were fond of living out-of-doors. 

"I am delighted," Mrs. Wilmarth said after 
they were gone. "I was afraid we might find 
ourselves a little lonesome." 

"If I felt any such malady threatening me I 
should go and have a chat or a race with old 
Neptune," laughed Helen. 

Indeed, the fortnight Mr. Wilmarth spent they 
were really very gay. One picnic over on the 
beach, and several sails and drives seemed to fill 
up every available moment. Mrs. Wilmarth soon 
became accustomed to the bathing, and Helen 
reveled in it, but Juliet could not be persuaded to 
venture. The Travis girls were quite expert 
swimmers, and the younger boys were very 
daring. 





One of the guests at Mrs. Ballinger's proved 
extremely interesting. She was slowly recover- 
ing from a severe accident, and was a young 
widow with moderate means. Indeed, Helen 
found herself relieved from much of the devotion 
she had set for herself. Mrs. Gilbert was fond 
of reading aloud, and she had moved in rather 
intellectual society. She took a great fancy to 
Juliet Craven, and thus for once Helen did not 
come first, and in her generous heart was de- 
lighted. 

Mrs. Wilmarth improved every day. It was 
quite like the olden times of health. 

There were many things to amuse as welL 
Helen found some people queerer than those at 
Hope. They seemed to have the flavor of the 
salt air which was different from inland towns. 
Their weather-beaten look left them sharp and 
shrewd, and full of subtle speeches that you had 
to think a moment or two about to discern the 
real meaning. There was something in the laugh 
as well, a sort of inner astuteness that sometimes 
puzzled her. Country people were not all alike. 
Environment stood for a good deal after all. She 
felt that her experiences were broadening. 

Chie day at the post office she found among her 
letters one from Daisy Bell. Why had she almost 



 

forgotten her in this rush of new experiences ? It 
had gone to Hope and been re-mailed. It was a 
full month since they had parted. She could 
not have written for she did not know Daisy's 
address. Yet, with her earnest nature she felt 
ar little conscience-smitten that she had not 
thought more about her. 

Daisy was having a splendid time. They had 
gone to Portland, then up among the islands, and 
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, and Mon- 
treal and the splendid Falls, where they would 
spend a week or more. Mr. Lawrence Hollis 
had joined them, and now he was really Marjo- 
rie's accepted lover. Annis and her husband were 
coming. Then they would go on to Detroit and 
Chicago. Traveling about was the most fascinat- 
ing thing in the world. You met so many charm- 
ing people. "I've made up my mind that I shall 
marry a very rich man who loves to travel. Ill 
go to Europe on my wedding tour and stay two 
years. Then there is that wonderful California 
and Japan, and I just feel as if I could keep 
going all my life. I envy the money that dull, 
queer Craven girl has, and she didn't want to go 
to Europe! She'd be just as well content with 
half of it. If I were you I'd strike her for some 
nice journeys. What will she ever do with all 





the money unless some man marries her for it? 
And where is the sense of her going to college !" 
gossiped Daisy. 

"What are you doing? Did you go off with 
that invalid friend to some poky place where there 
are no young men? I've had some gay times 
and been a good deal admired, but mamma is 
quite a duenna. Still, there are odds and ends 
you can pick up. Of course Margie's rather 
serious as befits a prospective clergyman's wife, 
so I can't go to her with my bits of fun. When 
we get home I shall want you to come at once. 
I had a touch of sentiment about going to college, 
I was such a pet with two girls who graduated 
with that high purpose in view, but I'm so glad 
I do not care about it. I think men, the nice 
young men, wouldn't raise up their little finger 
for much learning in a woman, and they have an 
idea that most college girls are or will be old 
maids. Of course you want to graduate some- 
where and have a diploma. 

"There, I can't write another word, but I want 
a good long letter from you. Now that I really 
have renewed my hold on you I shall not let you 
go, and mamma thinks there is no girl quite like 
you for a nice, steady friend. Oh, I must tell 
you about Willard. A dear friend of papa's 



 

oifered him a position in his law office, but he 
had to go at once as they needed some help while 
the other two partners were away — one in Eu- 
rope. It was very fine and complimentary, I 
believe, and papa quite insisted on his taking it, 
so the poor boy won't have any vacation until 
September. Good-bye, with oceans of love, 

"Daisy." 

Helen felt disappointed with the flippancy. 
And yet Daisy had a sweet and charming side to 
her nature. 

The letter was easily answered. The Travis 
girls had introduced them to some nice acquaint- 
ances, and they had met others at the chapel. 
The clergyman was attractive and had a charm- 
ing young wife who was a college graduate and 
who exhorted all girls who had any desire to 
go for the excellent training. It gave life a much 
wider outlook. 

Then there had been one tremendous storm 
when it seemed as if the house would be blown 
farther inland or toppled over. They didn't 
wonder that trees grew awry. The rain was 
like a deluge. A night and a day, then another 
night and a dull gray morning with a cold wind. 
No bathing, and Mrs. Ballinger's "boy" brought 
up the mail. 





Katy had cleared the asparagus branches and 
the fern leaves out of the dining room fire-place 
and built a splendid log fire that diffused a de- 
lightful warmth around. Mrs. Ballinger had run 
over to see if they were all safe. There had been 
a few leakages in the roof, and part of the gar- 
den fence had blown down. Helen had read 
and sung and talked and now the room was get- 
ting too strait for the energetic girl. 

"I think Fll wrap up and take a little walk," 
she announced. "The fire has baked me red and 
brown, so I must try a turn out-of-doors to re- 
store the equilibrium. Juliet?" inquiringly. 

"I do not think I can be tempted. And you 
are crazy! The storm hasn't ended." 

"There is a light streak in the west." 

"But the wind is east." 

"Oh Helen, don't go out. So near night, too," 
pleaded Mrs. Wilmarth. 

"Just for a little run down to the bay, and a 
look at the wrecked bathing house. You will 
see how fresh I shall return. Think of staying
