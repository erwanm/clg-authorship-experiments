 

boat, and twenty-six in the other. A sailor's blue jacket, 
and a cushion, which we found in the boat, were, by com- 
mon consent, accorded to me, in consideration of my 
suffering condition. The ship's surgeon was among us, 
but he had no medicines; chewed biscuit was the only 
thing that he could apply to my wounds, and in the mercy 
of God it healed them. I wished to give my shirt, like 
the others, for the sails, but they would not consent, and I 
most gratefully acknowledged the consideration with which 
I was treated. 

We rested all day long, that we might not weary our- 
eelves with rowing ; but we finished the sails, which were 
up before night. All this happened on the day after the 
shipwreck. 

We directed our course by the stars, whose rising and 
setting we observed carefully; and I drew, as well as I 
could, upon one of the planks of the deck, a chart repre- 
senting the islands of Sumatra and Java, with the straits 
between them, through which we hoped to steer. On the 
day when the ship was blown up, we were, by the most 
exact calculation, five and a half degrees south of the line 
and twenty miles from land. The nights were now so cold 
that in the mornings we were perfectly stiff, while in the 
day time we suffered from the most intense heat, for the 
sun was directly above our heads. 

The few pounds| of biscuit, which was all our store, I 
divided into rations and distributed daily among the men ; 
but we were very near the end of them, althrugh the 
piece that each one had for the whole day, was scarcely 
half a finger in size. Our supply of fresh water had failed 



 

entirely, so the first time that it rained we spresui out the 
Bail and caught the water, with which we filled two small 
casks. to serve us on days when we had no rain. But we 
were soon obliged to break into this last supply, and I 
dipped up the water in the end of a shoe ; each man came 
to me, drank his portion, and then went quickly back to 
his place. But in the midst of their thirst, the men all 
said to me, " Drink yourself, captain, as much as you 
want, for we all depend upon your Although their kind- 
ness touched me, I could not bring myself to take more 
than my share. 

Up to this time the two boats had always ket in sight 
of each other, but as the long boat sailed much faster than 
the other, the men in the latter exerted themselves to get 
nearer to us ; and, as they knew almost nothing of the 
management of a boat, entreated us to take them up into 
ours, lest they should be separated from us during the 
night. But our crew refused their request, and cried out 
to me, " Captain, if we take them in, we shall all go to 
the bottom, for the boat will not be able to sail" I could 
not prevail with them, and we were obliged to leave them 
to their fate. 

We were now miserable in the extreme. Our biscuit 
was all consumed, and we could see no land. I used all 
my powers of eloquence to convince the men that we could 
not be far from the coast of Java, and prayed them to 
hiive patience, but their patience did not last long ; they 
soon ceased to listen to me, and began to murmur and 
whisper among themselves, "Let the captain sav wliatie 


will, we are just as likely to be sailing abcut on the open 
sea as approaching the coast of Java." 

After we had fasted for a long time, and starvation 
seemed inevitable, a few sea-mews chanced to fly so near 
to us that we caught them in our hands, stripped off the 
feathers, and cut them up into little pieces, which we divi- 
ded most conscientiously; each man devoured the share 
that fell to him with the greatest avidity. As for myself, 
I thought it better than any delicacy I had evdr tasted ; 
honey had never been half so sweet to me, and we lamen- 
ted that there was no chance of our again enjoying such a 
treat. There was still no sign of land, and the men lost 
all courage, and silently awaited their fate, when the other 
boat again approached us, and the men in it renewed their 
entreaties to be taken in. As death seemed inevitable, we 
consented at least to die all together, and they left their 
boat to the mercy of the waves, bringing with them their 
thirty oars, which I arranged upon the benches, so as to 
form a kind of deck under which our seventy-two men, 
divided into two parties, alternately rested. 

In spite of all this, we were, as can easily be imagined, 
huddled very closely together, and gazed upon each other 
with the despairing expression of men who had nothing to 
"eat, no water to drink, and who could not see a bird upon 
the sea, nor a cloud in the air which might bring them 
relief. When we had given up all hope and had begun to 
prepare ouselves for death, it pleased God to reanimate our 
sinking courage once more, for a great number of flying 
Qsh sprung out of the waves and fell into the Voat ; we 
seized them eagerly, and devoured them raw, with as much 



 

enjoyment as formerly in the case of the searmews. But 
now our thirst increased fearfully, and in their despair, 
Bome of the men began to drink the water from the sea, 
although I cried out, " friends, forbear to drink the salt 
water, it will not quench your thirst and will kill you." 
Others sought refuge in the little pieces of lead and rusty 
nails that they could find in the vessel, which they chewed 
for a temporary relief. 

Our misery increased every day, and despair took pos- 
session of us, for the men cast upon each other angry, 
greedy looks, as though they longed to fall upon and 
devour one another; indeedj they soon began to speak 
openly of it, declaring that they would begin with the 
cabin-boy. Such horror seized me at this dreadful ide 
that I almost lost my courage and presence of mind. In 
this extremity I turned to God, and begged him as fer- 
vently as I could, not to permit such a horrible crime ; I 
then addressed my men, who were actually preparing to 
kill the cabin-boy, with all the earnestness, and with the 
most touching words at my command : 

"Friends, what are you about to do ? Do you not recoil 
from such a crime? Turn your thoughts to God; he 
will look in mercy upon you, and deliver you from this 
dreadful temptation, for we cannot be far from land." 

Then I showed them on the chart which I had cut on 
the deck, the spot where I believed we were, but they 
replied that I had said the same thing for many days, and 
deceived them with hopes that were never realized ; they 
could not tell whether I was deceived myself, or was only 
bent upon deceiving them. Spite of these threatening 



 

speeclies, they consentedj at my entreaty, to wait for three 
days, but swore to carry out their cruel determination if 
help did not appear at the end of that time. This decis- 
ion almost broke my heart. I redoubled my prayers, and 
implored God to have pity upon us and prevent the com- 
mission of such a crime. In the meanwhile the time flew 
by, and our hunger and thirst were so intense that they 
could scarcely be endured. 

" Ail," cried some, " if we were only on land, we could 
at least eat grass like the cattle." 

From this, one can form some idea of our fierce hunger; 
I tried to cheer up the men with the most encouraging 
words that I could think of Hope, which was decreasing 
rapidly in my breast, still sustained me, and although my 
wounds had weakened me much, and still pained me, I 
was among the strongest, and could still walk from one 
end to the other of the boat, while many could not stir 
from the spot where they were lying. 

Thirteen days had passed since the shipwreck, and our 
hope of reaching the coast of Sumatra, which I had not 
thought far distant, grew every hour more indistinct. All 
declared that our thirst was no longer to be borne, when 
the weather grew cloudy and rain began to fall; we imme- 
diately spread out the sail and laid down upon the deck 
to catch every drop that we could in our mouths, while we 
filled our casks as before. 

I was steering the vessel at this time, and according to 
my calculations, we were very near land ; I hoped that the 
weather would clear up, but it continued to rain so vio- 
lently, and I was so cold and wet that I could hold out no 



 

longer. I called to one of the sailors to relieve me, and 
crept under the deck to warm me. 

IV. 

"Land! land! Friends, we are close to the coast," 
suddenly cried the steersman, before he had been more 
than an hour at the helm, quite beside himself With joy. 

The land which we should have discovered much sooner 
in clear weather, lay really just before us, and it was a 
pleasure to see how all immediately aroused themselves, 
and came eagerly forward to see how far distant it was 
and how soon we could reach it. We spread all sail that 
we might arrive before nightfall. As we approached we 
perceived that the breakers were too strong to admit of 
our weathering them, and we discovered a little island 
where was a small bay, in which we cast anchor. The 
starved crew, gathering together all their remaining 
strength, sprang on shore, and distributed themselves 
every where, in search of something to eat; I threw 
myself upon the ground, kissed it, and gave thanks to 
God for his timely ?iid, and for having shielded us from the 
commission of so foul a crime as the men would have per- 
petrated on the following day, for this was the last of the 
days that they had promised to wait, and the cabin boy 
would have been killed on the morrow. 

We found an abundance of cocoanuts on the island, but 
no sweet water ; we were, however, quite satisfied with the 
refreshing juice of the youngest and tenderest nuts, while 
the harder ones served us for meat. We indulged too freely 
in this delicious food after our long fast, and were extremely 




ill the next day ; we rolled on the ground and shrieked 
with agony; but it did not last long, and on the following 
morning we were well again. 

We explored the island but found no food but cocoanuts, 
and encountered quite a large serpent ; we saw no human 
beings, but found traces of vessels having touched there. 
As it could not be far from Sumatra, according to our cal- 
culations, we loaded our vessel with cocoanuts and set sail 
again towards evening. The next morning, Sumatra lay 
in sight, and with a favourable breeze we bore down upon 
the coast and sailed along, looking for a harbor where we 
might land, until our provision of nuts was exhausted. 
Then, as the breakers seemed every where too strong to 
trust ourselves to them, it was decided that four or five of 
the best swimmers should attempt to reach the shore, and 
search more narrowly for a good landing place. This plan 
succeeded, and they soon arrived upon the shore of a river 
where they gave us the signal agreed upon.; we steered in 
that direction, but just at the mouth of the river there 
was a sand-bank, upon which the waves broke with great 
fury. 

" Friends," I cried, " I cannot undertake to land here 
without your unanimous consent and co-operation, for if 
the boat strikes, which is quite possible, I cannot bear the 
blame alone." 

I then asked them for their advice ; they had but one 
opinion — it was best to attempt the landing. 

" Well, then," I replied, " if you are all willing, I am 
ready to share the danger with you." 

I then placed myself at the helm, and prepared to eut 



 

directly through the breakers, but the Sni wave filled our 
boat half full with water. 

" Friends," I cried, " bale her out as quickly as possible." 
This they did as well as they could with hats, shoes, and 
the two casks that we had on board, and with such success 
that our boat was almost empty again, when a second wave 
filled it anew, so that for a while it could make no further 
progress, and was near sinking. 

" Keep her as steady as possible," I cried, " and redouble 
your exertions, or we are all lost." 

The men worked, indeed, with superhuman energy ; the 
third wave was small and did not bring us much water, 
and, as immediately afterward the sea ebbed, we passed 
safely through the raging breakers. When we had sailed 
a little further, we tried the water and found it firesh ; this 
occasioned us no little joy. We landed on the river, which 
was covered with low bushes, upon which we found a kind 
of small sweet beans, which tasted excejllently. Some of 
our people, ascending a little hill just before us, found the 
glimmering coals of a recent fire, and some tobacco, with 
which they joyfully returned. Some natives had probably 
encamped there, and had forgotten the tobacco, or left it 
there purposely. We now fell to with the axes that we 
had with us, and cut down several small trees, of which we 
made fires in five or six different places, and the crew, 
lying at their ease around them, smoked the tobacco with 
the most intense enjoyment. 

In the evening we replenished the fires, and three of us 
Kept watch to guard against an attack from the natives, 
whom we stood in great dread of, particularly as the moon 



 

was on the wane, and the night was very dark. Sea icely 
had we lam down, when the beans, which we had eaten in 
such quantities, caused us such fearful agony that we 
scarcely hoped to survive it. Just when the pain was 
most violent, our watch startled u with the cry, " The 
savages are coming !" We started up, and spite of oux 
illness, and although we had no weapons beside the two 
axes and an old rusty sword, the instinct of self-preservap 
tion gave us new courage and strength. We all with one 
accord seized the fire-brands, and ran towards the enemy ; 
the sparks, being scattered on all sides, must have pre- 
sented an imposing appearance, for the natives took to 
flight, and concealed themselves in a neighboring forest. 

Our people now assembled again around the fires, but 
the rest of the night was spent in great suffering. Hein 
Rol and I did not like the idea of remaining upon the 
land, and we betook ourselves to our craft. 

On the following morning, at sunrise, three natives ap- 
proached us from the forest, and we sent three of our peo- 
ple to meet them, who had learnt the Malay language, 
which is spoken in Sumatra. A conference was immedi- 
ately held, and the natives inquired first of all to what 
nation the strange men belonged. 

" We are Dutchmen," our men replied, " and have lost 
our vessel by fire, and have landed here to buy provisions 
of you, if you have them." 

" We have chickens and rice," they replied, to our {rreat 
satisfaction, for it was just this kind of food that we stood 
most in need of. 

During the conversation the savages drew nearer to the 



 

vessel, aiid asked inquisitively if we had any weapons with, 
us ; we answered as prudence dictated, that we were welt 
provided with them, as well as with powder and shot. As 
I had spread out the sails upon our hoat, they could not 
look in to convince themselves of the truth of our asser- 
tion. They now brought us some boiled rice and a few 
chickens, for which we paid with a few Spanish coins that 
we had in our pockets. 

" Well, my friends," I said, " let us betray no fear, but 
sit directly down, and eat what we have procured, and 
then consider what we shall next do." 

When we had finished our meal, we consulted how we 
should supply our necessities. As we were not perfectly 
sure of our whereabouts, we asked the natives to tell us 
the name of their country, and though we could neither 
understand, nor make ourselves understood perfectly, we 
gathered from them that we were really upon Sumatra, for 
when we mentioned Java, they pointed towards the south- 
east, and uttered distinctly the name of Jan Coen, who was 
the Dutch commander upon that island. We were now 
convinced that we were upon the right road, and were not 
a little rejoiced. 



Being still in need of provisions, it was determined that,, 
in order to procure them, I, with four of our men, should 
go in a light pirogue, belonging to the natives, to one of the 
nearest villages. I reached it safely, bought a good supply 
of rice and chickens, and sent them to Hein Eol to dis- 
tribute amonff the men. Then  I and my four men cooked 



 

several fowls and some rice, and eat a good hearty meal; 
we drank besides a quantity of a kind of wine made from 
the sap of a tree, so strong as to be intoxicating. "While 
eating, the inhabitants of the village sat round us, and 
fievoured with their eyes every mouthful that we took. 
After dinner I bought a buffalo, which, however, was too 
wild to be led away. As we had already wasted some 
time, I proposed to return to our friends, and leave the 
buffalo till the next day. My four sailors begged me so 
earnestly to allow them to spend the night in the village, 
assuring me that they could easily take the buffalo when 
he should lay down for the night, that although I hesitated ; 
at first, I at last consented, took leave of them, and bade 
them good night. 

"When I came to the bank of the river, where the 
pirogue lay, I encountered a multitude of savages, who 
were arguing with one another very earnestly, the point 
being, as I gathered from their gestures, whether they 
should detain me or let me go. Without a moment's 
delay I seized two of them by the arms, and pushed them 
forwards, whilst I gave them to understand by signs that 
they must row me down the river, as my servants or 
slaves. They eyed me maliciously, but were so overawed 
by my boldness that they obeyed, and entered the canoe. 

I seated myself in the middle of the boat, and the two 
savages, who both wore daggers in their girdles, took their 
places before and behind me. They had only made one 
or two strokes \yith the oars, when the one sitting behind 
me, gave me to understand, by signs, that he wanted 
money ;  I quietly put my hand in my pocket and gave 



 

him a small coin, which he looked at for some tinle, evi- 
dently undecided what to do, and finally tied it up in the 
comer of the girdle that he wore around his waist, and 
then resumed his oars. When the other savage perceived 
how his companion's request had been answered, he also 
made the same signs ; with the same coolness I drew a 
small piece of money from my pocket and handed it to 
him. He turned it over in his hand and seemed still more 
undecided than his companion, whether he should take it 
,quietly or fall upon me. He niight have overcome me 
very easily, for I was unarmed, and I felt like a lainb 
between two wolves. Heaven knows how my heart was 
beating at that moment. 

In the meantime, as the tide was ebbing we glided 
  quickly down the river, and were, about mid-day, on our 
return, when the two natives commenced a conversation 
which grew more and more earnest, and from which t 
could only too clearly understand their murderous inten- 
tions. This threw me into such a panic that I actually 
liila-embled, and I inwardly prayed most fervently that God 
would instruct me what to do in this trying emergency. 
Scarcely was my prayer ended when a voice within ine 
suggested that I should begin to sing. Althougli .i cold 
shudder was running over me, I began to sing immediately 
with all my might, so that the forests which lined the 
shore echoed again, and I discovered for the first time that 
fear will drive a man to singing. 

When my two guides heard me singing they broke out 
into peals of laughter, and I read plainly in their faces 
that they considered my conduct as a proof that I enter- 



 

tained neitner fear nor suspicion. They were, however, 
quite mistaken ; my state of mind was very different from 
what they imagined it. I sung on without interruption, 
and very soon the canoe came in sight of our vessel. I 
arose and made a sign to some of my men stationed as a 
guard along the shore ; they observed it and hastened 
towards me. My courage rose, and when they were near 
enough to lend me any assistance that I might need, I 
commanded my two oarsman to land before me, for I 
thought this the surest way of guarding against a stab 
from behind; they obeyed me without the slightest hesi- 
tation, and thus I rejoined my companions in safety. The 
savages, without betraying the least vexation at the des- 
truction of their plan, asked various questions as to where 
we stayed and slept, and after I had satisfied them by 
pointing out to them the vessel and some huts made 
of the boughs of trees, they got into their pirogue and 
rowed off. 

The night passed without any disturbance, and we all 
slept so soundly that we did not wake until long after sun 
rise. When I heard that the men whom I had left behind 
in the village, had not yet returned, I became uneasy and 
began to fear that they might have met with some acci- 
dent. A few minutes afterwards, two natives appeared in 
the distance, driving a buffalo before them ; as they came 
nearer I observed that it was not the same that I had 
bought the day before, and asked them, through a sailor, 
who understood their language, why they had made an 
exchange, and where our four men were. They replied 
fihat they had found it impossible to bring the unruly ani- 



 

mal that I had bought, and that our men would soon 
appear with another buffalo. 

This answer somewhat allayed my apprehensions, and 
as I saw that the creature that they were driving was yery 
fierce and unmanagable, I told one of my men standing 
near, to take the axe and lame the beast, as we could not 
afford to lose him. 

The man obeyed, and the buffalo fell to the ground. At 
the same moment the savages uttered a fearful yell, and at 
this sign two or three hundred more rushed out of the 
forest where they had been cancealed, and ran towards our 
vessel, evidently with the intention of cutting off our 
retreat to it. At first this gave me no uneasiness, and I 
said coolly to my men, " Stand still and show no fear ; we 
are quite strong enough to make our way through that 
cowardly mob." 

But scarcely were the words out of my mouth, when the 
savages burst forth from all parts of the forest in such 
overpowering numbers that it seemed as if the whole pop- 
ulation of the island were resolved upon our destruction. 
They were armed with spears and shields, and made the 
most frantic gestures. 

" My friends," I cried, when I comprehended our danger, 
" make for the vessel as quickly as possible. If they suc- 
ceed in cutting us off from it we are lost." 

We began to run with all our might, and most of us 
reached our destination in safety ; others sprang into the 
stream and swam down the river. The savages were so 
close behind us that, before we pushed off, several of our 
people had perished by the spears of their blood-thirsty 



 

assailaats. The sails were stretched out like a roof over, 
the deck, and it seemed almost impossible to draw up the 
anchor. While working at it we fought bravely with our 
two axes, and killed several of the savages, who boldly 
attempted to get on board. Our ship-baker, a tall, strong 
man, particularly distinguished himself by his courage in 
using an old rusty sword. 

" Now cut the rope," I cried to him, but his weapon was 
not sharp enough. I sprang to his side, and drawing the 
rope upon the deck, we quickly severed it, and pusled'off 
from the shore. The savages rushed into the water after 
us, but they lost their footing on the steep bank, and were 
obliged to give up the chase. 

We now picked up our people, wlio were swimming 
down the river, and, as a favorable wind was blowing from 
the land, set sail. The breakers, which had nearly over- 
whelmed us in first approaching the shore, were passed 
through now without much difficulty, and we thus defeated 
the expectations of the savages, who were all collected 
upon a projecting point of land, awaiting our destruction. 

Our joy at our fortunate delivery from so imminent a 
danger, was embittered by the suffering 'of our poor baker, 
whose countenance now began to be much discoloured. 
He had received a slight wound from a spear in his side, of 
which at first he took no notice, but as the spear was 
poisoned, it began to grow black, and inflamed in a few 
moments. I cut out all the flesh that seemed to be afieo 
ted, but I gave him needless pain, for he died shortlv after- 
ward in' the greatest agony, and we threw the body into 
the sea. 



When we numbered over our men we found that sixteen 
were missing ; eleven had perished in our flight, the baker 
and the four who had remained in the village, and who had 
probably fallen victims to their imprudence during the 
night. I had to thank them, however, for my safety, as 
if all five had attempted to return, we should undoubtedly 
have fallen a prey to the savages, from whom I had been 
So wonderfully preserved. 

VI. 

We now sailed rapidly along the coast, before the wind ; 
the provisions which we had with us comprised only eighl; 
fowls and some rice — rather a moderate supply for fifty 
men. It was soon exhausted, and as the sea afibrded us 
no food, we were obhged to land in the first bay that we 
discovered. Not far from the shore a crowd of natives 
was assembled, but as they instantly took to flight, we 
could not ask them for provisions. Meanwhile we found 
excellent water to drink, which we were very glad of, and 
on the shore of the bay quantities of small oysters, with 
which, when our hunger was satisfied, we filled our pock- 
ets. A hatfull of pepper, which I had bought at our first 
landing-place, stood us in good stead in helping us to digest 
this food. 

We soon pushed off again and hold out more to sea, but 
we had not proceeded far when tha wind rose and soon 
increased to a storm; we drew in the sails, spread them 
over the deck, crept under them, and resigned ourselves to 
the waves. Towards morning, the storm abated, and we 
set sail again. At day-break we discovered before us three 



 

amall islands, upon which we determined to land, although 
they appeared to be uninhabited. We reached the nearest 
the same day and found fresh water, of which we stood in 
great need. We saw here also, great bamboo reeds as 
thick as a man's wrist. We cut these down, cutting 
througL one of the solid knobs at the bottom, filled them 
with water and stopped them up with a cork at the top. 
Thus we obtained quite a supply of fresh water ; but 
although we explored the whole island, we found no fruits 
or living creatures, and we were obliged to contend Cif- 
eelves with the cabbage-like leaves of the palm tree. 

One day I left my companions, who wore lying on the 
ground at the foot of the mountain, and iiiounted to its 
summit, to endeavor to discover some spot which might 
be inhabited or have been visited before, for all the hopes 
of the crew rested upon me alone. But as I had never 
been in these seas before, and had no compass or any other 
instruments so necessary to the mariner, I could not decide 
what course we should take to arrive at Java. When I 
had reached the summit, I saw around me nothing but sky 
and sea, not a trace of land. As I always had in my 
Borest need, turned to God, I did it now, fell upon my 
knees and prayed him earnestly to open the eyes of my 
spirit, that I might discover the true path of safety for 
myself and my companions. I then arose to descend 
again, and cast my eyes around me once more. Then it 
seemed to me that some clouds on my right hand were 
dispersing, and in a little while the atmosphere became so 
dear that I could discern in the far distance, two high blue 
mountains. I now suddenly remembered that at home T 



 

had heard a traveller from the East Indies, say that in 
approaching Java from Europe, the island could be recog- 
nized by two mountains on its western extremity, which 
looked blue in the distance. But we had come along the 
left coast of Sumatra to the island where we now were, 
and these mountains were upon the right. I saw distinctly 
between them an empty space and could discover no land 
in the back ground ; as I knew that the straits of Sunda sep- 
arated Java from Sumatra, I felt confident that I had disr 
covered the right way, and descended the mountain, to 
impart my discovery to Hein Eol. 

" Your supposition," said he joyfully, " appears to me 
perfectly correct; let us immediately collect the crew and 
prepare to take the direction you propose." 

We all hastened our preparations, and as the wind was 
favorable, we set sail the same day, and steered directly 
for the strait that I had discovered. At midnight we saw 
in the distance a glimmering light, and thought at first 
that it must be the signal light of some vessel, but as a 
second soon appeared in almost the same place, we could 
not but think that we were near the land. At day-break 
the wind left us entirely, for we were already upon the 
inner coast of Java. A sailor, whom I sent to the mast- 
head to look roimd, cried out, " I see a quantity of ships," 
and immediately counted thirty-three of them. We were 
filled with inexpressible joy, and most of our men began 
to spring and dance like children. As the calm continued, 
they seized the oars and rowed to the place where the fleet 
lay at anchor. 

We soon recognized the Dutch flag, and thanked Grod 




that we were surrounded by countrymen. The commandej 
of the squadron, Frederick Houtman, of Alkmaar, was 
standing in the prow of his vessel, and, attracted by ou* 
curious sails, examined us through his spy-glass ; not being 
able to understand the strange appearance, he sent a boat 
out to us to know who we were, and whence we came. 
The men in this boat had sailed with us from Holland in 
another ship ; they instantly recognized us, and took Heia 
Rol and myself to the admiral's vessel. He received us 
most cordially, carried us into the cabin, and without delay 
had the table covered with a hearty meal for us. When 
I saw the bread and the other food, I was so much 
affected that the tears rolled down my cheeks, and I could 
scarcely eat. In the meantime my men had arrived, and 
had been divided among the other vessels, where they met 
with the greatest kindness. 

After the admiral had listened with astonishment to our 
adventures, he sent us in a yacht to Batavia, the capital 
of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies. We arrived 
on the following morning, presented ourselves before the 
Governor-general, Jan Pieters Coen, and related the story 
of our sufferings to him. 

" Who can be blamed — it was a great misfortune," he 
said drily, after he had heard us to the end without once 
interrupting us. Then he asked us concerning several 
incidents of our voyage. 

" Who can be blamed — it was a great misfortune," he 
repeated again, just as drily, after we had answered his 
questions. 



 

Then he had a golden goL*».t brought to him, and said 
somewhat more cordially : 

" Captain, I wish better luck to you for the future, and 
drink your health. Tou should remember, all your life- 
time, the mercy that has been shown to you, for the Al- 
mighty has repeatedly spared your life when you ha,d given 
yourself up for lost." Then drinking to the health of Hein 
Eol, he added, " Remain as guests in my house Until I can 
provide further for you." 

In the course of a fortnight he made me captain, and 
Hein Rol the supercargo, of a vessel of thirty-two guns. 
We thanked him most heartily, and were not a little 
rejoiced that we two, who had stood by each other in mis 
fortune, were again serving in the same vessel. 




On an uncomfortable evening, when the fog was bo 
thick that we could scarcely see the end of the bowsprit, 
I was walking backwards and forwards on the deck of my 
vessel, which was steering for the island of the Green 
Mountains, to take ia a cargo of salt, oppressed by an 
inexplicable terror which quite overcame my better judg- 
ment. No one on board was thinking of danger, and the 
man at the helm was just calling " ten o'clock," when 
retired to my cabin. Soon after I heard ominous sounds 
among the men on watch, and as I hastened upon deck I 
was greeted by a piercing cry. At first I thought of 
nothing but a sudden gale of wind, and was about to issue 
the necessary orders, when I perceived breakers foaming 
and raging on our left. As none, however, were to be seen 
ahead, I hoped to escape even this danger, and ordered the 
ftnchor to be in readiness ; but this hope vanished utterly 
when the vessel was driven by the current and a mighty 
wave directly towards the breakers, and I saw she must be 
vrrecked. We dropped our largest anchor, and drew in all 
sail, but wave upon wave urged us forward and we were 
driven upon the saud with such a shock that the crew 
were prostrated upon the deck. 

I knew now that there was no hope for the ship, which 
must soon fill with water, and instantly I gave orden to 




 

have all the provisions, that could be got at, brought upon 
deck, and we then emptied several wine casks, that they 
might hold the water drawn from the hogsheads on board. 
The waves broke over our bows, and swept the forward 
deck, but we succeeded in launching both the long and 
small boat, and had loaded the former with five casks of 
water, as many of wine, three casks of biscuits, and four 
others with salt meat, besides books, charts, nautical instru- 
ments, and clothes, before the day dawned and allowed us 
to discover our proximity to the land ; as I found it quite 
near, I secured one end of a stout cable to the mast of the 
ship, and the other to our small boat, into which I, with 
one of the crew, descended on the side of the vessel where 
the fury of the waves was broken. In pushing off we were 
perfectly overwhelmed in the boiling, angry flood, and im- 
mediately driven forwards more than a hundred yards ; 
the foaming breakers only now and then allowed us a short 
breathing space, but at last we were with our boat hurled 
upon a low sandy shore. 

My first care, after recovering from the shock, was to 
bale out the boat and drag it high up upon the shore. For- 
tunately, the cable was still secured to it, and we fastened 
it securely by means of a part of the vessel which had been 
already thro'wn upon the shore. Our ship lay at high 
tide, about a hundred yards from the shore, and in order 
to rescue the crew, a strong rope was tied to the cable, 
which stretched from them to us ; we drew it over to us 
and secured it firmly. This accomplished, two men got 
into the long boat which was loaded with our provisions, &c., 
and on the back of a huge wave, reached the land, but the 



 

boat was dashed upon the shore with so much violeace 
that it broke. With the greatest difficulty we succeeded 
in saving three casks of buiscuit and two of pork. For 
the rest of the crew on board of the vessel, no means of 
safety now remained but the tightly stretched rope, and I 
immediately urged them, by signs, to avail themselves of 
it. The boldest of the sailors threw off his jacket, seized 
the rope, and began his perilous journey ; as soon as he got 
beyond the protection of the wreck, the waves rose, each, 
some yards above his head, and seemed to bury him in 
their depths ; he, however, held on with the gripe of one 
working for his life, and gained a little distance between 
each wave, until one more powerful than the rest, tore the 
rope from him and hurled him upon the shore, where we 
rolled him over and over, until he came to himself. I 
stood up to my chin in the water, although the waves 
broke over my head, and gave all the assistance in my 
power, to the men coming over on the rope, and I was so 
fortunate as to receive the whole crew safe upon the land. 
As we saw that we were upon a desert, barren coast, our 
first, care was to secure the casks of water and provision 
that we had fished out of the breakers ; we then erected 
with our oars and two sails a kind of tent, foolishly purposing that no one would discover us in this inhospitable 
country, and purposing to mend our boats with the wood 
and planks that would be thrown on shore from the wreck, 
so that we might put to sea in a calm, and with the help 
of our compass, reach some European settlement or friendly 
vessel. 



While were diligently occupied in the erection of our 
tent, we perceived a human form emerging from behind a 
sand-hill, and proceed to the shore to plunder our effects, 
which were strewn about there. I approached the stran- 
ger with every sign of peace and amity that I could think 
of; but he seemed very shy, and gave me to understand, 
by signs, that I must keep myself at a distance, while he 
continued to possess himself of our property. I then grew 
angiy, and as he was imarmed, approached until I was 
within twenty paces of him. 

Apparently, he was quite old, but still powerful and 
agile ; the color of his skin was darker than that of a 
North American Indian, and lighter than that of a negro ; 
his clothing consisted of a piece of coarse woollen cloth 
that reached from his breast to his knees. His hair was 
long, matted, and stood out far around his head like a stiff 
brush ; his face resembled more an ourang-outang than a 
human being ; red, fiery eyes, a mouth stretching from ear 
to ear, but filled with sound teeth, and a beard hanging 
down upon his breast from his upper Up and chin, gave him 
a frightful appearance and suggested forcibly to my mind, 
the idea that those teeth had been sharpened in feasts of 
human flesh. Two old women, of a Kke exterior, appa- 
rently his wives, soon joined him. Although they were 
not quite as repulsive as the old man, and wore their long 
hair in braids, yet they were anything but attractive, for 
their brown skin hung in flabby folds from their bodies, 
and their eye-teeth projected like the tusks of the wild 



 

boar. A girl from eighteeu to twenty years old, who was 
just not hideous, and six children of various site and sex, 
entirely naked, completed the group ; they took what they 
wanted, and carried the articles of clothing in-shore, where 
they spread them out to dry. They emptied the beds of 
their contents as they perceived the utility of the outside 
only, and amused themselves with the blowing about of 
the feathers by the wind. 

All appeared perfectly satisfied with their booty, and 
even the forbidding features of the old man brightened a 
little when he encountered no opposition on our part. We 
were, indeed, provided with no fire-arms or other efiective 
weapons, but it would not have been difficult to have 
driven this mob away with some of the poles and planks 
of the wreck. Some of the sailors were preparing to do 
so, but I dissuaded them from it, as I saw clearly that in 
our present wretched condition, the friendship of these 
people was a matter of great importance to us. We qui- 
etly let them take what they wanted and determined to 
defend our provisions only, to the last. 

After spending the day in the erection of our tent, and 
in mending our injured boat, upon which rested all our 
hope of safety, we kindled a great fire and prepared an 
excellent meal of salt meat, not suspecting that this would 
be the last of our provisions that we should enjoy. When 
we had thus refreshed ourselves, we set two of our men as 
a watch, and stretched out our weary limbs upon the soft 
sand. Night had already enveloped every thing in her 
dark mantle, the savages were at a distance, and all was 
 till except the restless waves which broke \apon the for- 



 

gaken wreck and dashed upon some rocks at no great distance firom us. Up to this moment, the exertion which 
our situation rendered necessary, had so occupied my mind 
as to banish all reflection, but now it broke like a flood 
over my soul and the necessary sleep forsook my weary 
frame. The crew relied for safety upon the miserably 
mended boat, but I doubted if we could ever escape from 
the coast through the raging breakers in such a frail skiff. 
On land, danger menaced us from the wild, greedy savages, 
who might be evfea now preparing to rob us, if not of Hfe 
yet of freedom, dragging us away to a slavery worse than 
death. I was distressed and despairing ; a thousand anx 
ieties filled my mind. I was a husband and the father of 
five little children, whom I dearly loved and whom I must 
soon leave orphans. I shuddered, but at last was able to 
say within myself, " Thy ways, great Father of the uni- 
verse, are wisdom and goodness, and who am I ? A grain 
of dust; shall I complain of thy decrees?" 

I soon found consolation in the thought that my companions, who lay around me buried in the deepest slumber, 
were still alive and with me, and I felt it my solemn duty 
to exert all my power for their preservation and safety. 
Occupied with such thoughts, the night passed slowly for 
me ; at last day dawned in the east, not upon a oheering 
prospect of rescue for us, but upon new scenes of misery. 

It was scarcely light when the old man, with his wives 
and children, and two young men whom I had not seen 
the day before, came down to us. He brandished a long 
spear above his head, as if he were about to throw it at us, 
and signified by threatening gestures that we must retreat 



 

to the wreck if we would not fall into the hands  
of his people, whom I already perceived in the distance, 
approaching us with a herd of camels. The women, at the 
same time, raised a fearful shriek, and threw sand into the 
air. When I ran towards the shore, to seize a plank lying 
there, the old man ran like a maniac to our tent, chased 
out of it, with a few pricks of his spear, the men who were 
yet sleeping there, and so terrified them, by his gestures 
and pointing to the drove of camels, that they all rushed 
towards the little boat, whilst I kept the old man at ahttle 
distance with my plank. They prepared to embark in such 
confusion and disorder that the boat filled and sank. Then 
we attempted to escape along the shore, leaving behind us 
all our provision, but the terrible spear was turned against 
us, and we were surrounded by the women, screaming and 
gesticulating like fiends. We now saw that no way of 
escape was left for us ; they were forcing us to embark that 
they might be rid of us without danger to themselves. I 
therefore shoved the long boat into the water, and insisted 
that the crew should get in at the stem one by one ; thus 
we at last succeeded in escaping to the ship, which was by 
this time half full of water. 

III. 

The natives, as soon as we were no longer in the way, 
collected around our tent, and, brandishing their weapons, 
made their camels kneel down — loaded them with our pro- 
visions and other artibles, and then bade their children 
drive them off. The malicious old man cut open our wine 
and water casks, and let the contents escape; the other 



 

articles, for which they could find no use, books, nautical 
instruments, and charts, were heaped up together and 
burned. Now that we had neither food nor water, no 
choice was left us but to put to sea in our leaky boat, to 
remain in the vessel all night and be drowned, or to die in 
the hands of these cruel savages. These, we gathered 
from their gestures, would shortly return with fire-arms; 
besides they could easily reach the wreck, for a sand bar 
extending some distance into the &ea, was even nov,- visible, 
and would be quite dry at low tide. We therefore deter- 
mined to make preparations for our departure as quickly as 
possible; we fished up some pickled beef and bottles of 
wine firom the hold at the risk of our lives. We had no 
water, and our biscuit was all ruiaed. 

We rigged the long boat as well as we could, and were 
about to set sail, when the natives, touched with pity, as 
it seemed, for our wretched condition, approached the 
shore, bowed to the ground, and beckoned to us, with every 
sign of amity, to come again to the land. As we showed 
no inclination to do so, the old man advanced alone into 
the water up to his waist, with a leather bottle of water, 
and invited us repeatedly to come and drink. As we were 
not a little thirsty, I advanced towards him by means of 
the rope which stm stretched from the wreck to the land, 
took the bottle and brought it to my companions. The
