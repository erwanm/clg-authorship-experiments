being, was ready to concur in any attempt she 
might make to save her appearance of knowing no 
reproach. Yet, foreseeing the awkwardness that 
might arise from her committing herself too 
rashly, he made haste to say to Vidal that he 
would have been startled if he had not been fore 
warned: Mrs. Beever had mentioned to him the 
visit she had just received. 

" Ah, she told you ? " Dennis asked. 

"Me only as a great sign of confidence," Tony 
laughed. 

Rose, at this, could be amazed with superiority. 
" What ? you've already been here ? " 





"An hour ago," said Dennis. "I asked Mrs. 
Beever not to tell you." 

That was a chance for positive criticism. " She 
obeyed your request to the letter. But why in 
the world such portentous secrecy ? " Rose spoke 
as if there was no shade of a reason for his feel 
ing shy, and now gave him an excellent exam 
ple of the right tone. She had emulated Tony's 
own gesture of welcome, and he said to himself 
that no young woman could have stretched a 
more elastic arm across a desert of four cold 
years. 

"I can explain to you better," Dennis replied, 
" why I emerged than why I vanished." 

" You emerged, I suppose, because you wanted 
to see me." Rose spoke to one of her admirers, 
but she looked, she even laughed, at the other, 
showing him by this time an aspect completely 
and inscrutably renewed. "You knew I was 
here?" 

" At Wilverley ? " Dennis hesitated. " I took it 
for granted." 

" I'm afraid it was really for Miss Armiger you 
came," Tony remarked in the spirit of pleasantry. 
It seemed to him that the spirit of pleasantry 
would help them on. 



 

It had its result it proved contagious. "I 
would still say so before her even if it 
weren't ! " Dennis returned. 

Rose took up the joke. " Fortunately it's true 

so it saves you a fib." 

" It saves me a fib ! " Dennis said. 

In this way the trick was successfully played 

they found their feet; with the added amuse 
ment, for Tony, of hearing the necessary falsehood 
uttered neither by himself nor by Rose, but by a 
man whose veracity, from the first, on that earlier 
day, of looking at him, he had felt to be almost 
incompatible with the flow of conversation. It 
was more and more distinct while the minutes 
elapsed that the secondary effect of her old 
friend's reappearance was to make Rose shine 
with a more convenient light; and she met her 
embarrassment, every way, with so happy an art 
that Tony was moved to deplore afresh the com 
plication that estranged him from a woman of 
such gifts. It made up indeed a little for this 
that he was also never so possessed of his own 
as when there was something to carry off or to 
put, as the phrase was, through. His light hand, 
his slightly florid facility were the things that in 
managing, in presiding, had rendered him so 





widely popular ; and wasn't he, precisely, a little 
presiding, wasn't he a good deal managing, just 
now? Vidal would be a blessed diversion espe 
cially if he should be pressed into the service as 
one : Tony was content for the moment to see this 
with eagerness rather than to see it whole. His 
eagerness was justified by the circumstance that 
the young man from China did somehow or other 
the reasons would appear after the fact repre 
sent relief, relief not made vain by the reflection 
that it was perhaps only temporary. Rose her 
self, thank Heaven, was, with all her exaltation, 
only temporary. He could already condone the 
officiousness of a gentleman too interested in 
Erne's equilibrium: the grounds of that indiscre 
tion gleamed agreeably through it as soon as he 
had seen the visitor's fingers draw together over 
the hand held out by Rose. It was matter to 
whistle over, to bustle over, that, as had been cer 
tified by Mrs. Beever, the passion betrayed by 
that clasp had survived its shipwreck, and there 
wasn't a rope's end Tony could throw, or a stray 
stick he could hold out, for which he didn't imme 
diately cast about him. He saw indeed from this 
moment his whole comfort in the idea of an organ 
ised rescue and of making the struggling swimmer 



 

know, as a preliminary, how little anyone at the 
other house was interested in preventing him to 
land. 

Vidal had, for that matter, not been three min 
utes in touch with him before he really began to 
see this happy perception descend. It was, in a 
manner, to haul him ashore to invite him to dine 
and sleep; which Tony lost as little time as pos 
sible in doing; expressing the hope that he had 
not gone to the inn and that even if he had he 
would consent to the quick transfer of his effects 
to Bounds. Dennis showed that he had still some 
wonder for such an overture, but before he could 
respond to it the words were taken out of his 
mouth by Rose, whose recovery from her upset 
was complete from the moment she could seize a 
pretext for the extravagance of tranquillity. 

" Why should you take him away from us, and 
why should he consent to be taken? Won't Mrs. 
Beever," Rose asked of Dennis "since you're 
not snatching the fearful joy of a clandestine visit 
to her expect you, if you stay anywhere, to give 
her the preference ? " 

" Allow me to remind you, and to remind Mr. 
Vidal," Tony returned, "that when he was here 
before he gave her the preference. Mrs. Beever 





made no scruple of removing him bodily from 
under my roof. I forfeited I was obliged to 
the pleasure of a visit to him. But that leaves 
me with my loss to make up and my revenge to 
take I repay Mrs. Beever in kind." To find 
Rose disputing with him the possession of their 
friend filled him with immediate cheer. "Don't 
you recognise," he went on to him, " the propriety 
of what I propose? I take you and deal with 
Mrs. Beever, as she took you and dealt with me. 
Besides, your things have not even been brought 
here as they had of old been brought to Bounds. 
I promise to share you with these ladies and not 
to grudge you the time you may wish to spend 
with Miss Armiger. I understand but too well 
the number of hours I shall find you putting in. 
You shall pay me a long visit and come over here 
as often as you like, and your presence at Bounds 
may even possibly have the consequence of mak 
ing them honour me there a little oftener with 
their own." 

Vidal looked from one of his companions to the 
other; he struck Tony as slightly mystified, but 
not beyond the point at which curiosity was agree 
able. "I think I had better go to Mr. Bream," he 
after a moment sturdily said to Rose. "There's 



 

a matter on which I wish to talk with you, but 
I don't see that that need prevent." 

"It's for you to determine. There's a matter 
on which I find myself, to you also, particularly 
glad of the opportunity of saying a word." 

Tony glanced promptly at his watch and at Rose. 
"Your opportunity's before you say your word 
now. I've a little job in the town," he explained 
to Vidal ; " I must attend to it quickly, and I can 
easily stop at the hotel and give directions for the 
removal of your traps. All you will have to do, 
then, will be to take the short way, which you 
know over the bridge there and through my 
garden to my door. We shall dine at an easy 
eight." 

Dennis Vidal assented to this arrangement 
without qualification and indeed almost without 
expression : there evidently lingered in him an 
operative sense that there were compensations 
Mr. Bream might be allowed the luxurious con 
sciousness of owing him. Rose, however, showed 
she still had a communication to make to Tony, 
who had begun to move in the quarter leading 
straight from Eastmead to the town, so that he 
would have to pass near the house on going out. 
She introduced it with a question about his move- 





merits. " You'll stop, then, on your way and tell 
Mrs. Beever ?" 

" Of my having appropriated our friend ? Not 
this moment," said Tony "I've to meet a man 
on business, and I shall only just have time. I 
shall, if possible, come back here, but meanwhile 
perhaps you'll kindly explain. Come straight 
over and take possession," he added, to Vidal; 
"make yourself at home don't wait for me to 
return to you." He offered him a hand-shake 
again, and then, with his native impulse to accom 
modate and to harmonise making a friendly light 
in his face, he offered one to Rose herself. She 
accepted it so frankly that she even, for a minute, 
kept his hand a response that he approved with 
a smile so encouraging that it scarcely needed 
even the confirmation of speech. They stood 
there while Dennis Vidal turned away as if they 
might have matters between them, and Tony 
yielded to the impulse to prove to Rose that, 
though there were things he kept from her, he 
kept nothing that was not absolutely necessary. 
"There's something else I've got to do I've 
got to stop at the Doctor's." 

Rose raised her eyebrows. " To consult him ? " 

" To ask him to come over." 



 

" I hope you're not ill." 

" Never better in my life. I want him to see 
Effie." 

" #Ae's not ill, surely?" 

" She's not right with the fright Gorham had 
this morning. So I'm not satisfied." 

" Let him then by all means see her," Rose said. 

Their talk had, through the action of Vidal's 
presence, dropped from its chilly height to the 
warmest domestic level, and what now stuck out 
of Tony was the desire she should understand 
that on such ground as that he was always glad 
to meet her. Dennis Vidal faced about again in 
time to be called, as it were, if only by the tone 
of his host's voice, to witness this. "A bientot. 
Let me hear from you and from him that in 
my absence you've been extremely kind to our 
friend here." 

Rose, with a small but vivid fever-spot in her 
cheek, looked from one of the men to the other, 
while her kindled eyes showed a gathered purpose 
that had the prompt and perceptible effect of ex 
citing suspense. " I don't mind letting you know, 
Mr. Bream, in advance exactly how kind I shall be. 
It would be affectation on my part to pretend to 
be unaware of your already knowing something of 





what has passed between this gentleman and me. 
He suffered, at my hands, in this place, four years 
ago, a disappointment a disappointment into the 
rights and wrongs, into the good reasons of which 
I won't attempt to go further than just to say that 
an inevitable publicity then attached to it." She 
spoke with slow and deliberate clearness, still look 
ing from Tony to Vidal and back again; after 
which her strange intensity fixed itself on her old 
suitor. "People saw, Mr. Vidal," she went on, 
" the blight that descended on our long relations, 
and people believed and I was at the time in 
different to their believing that it had occurred 
by my act. I'm not indifferent now that is to 
any appearance of having been wanting in consid 
eration for such a man as you. I've often wished 
I might make you some reparation some open 
atonement. I'm sorry for the distress that I'm 
afraid I caused you, and here, before the principal 
witness of the indignity you so magnanimously 
met, I very sincerely express my regret and very 
humbly beg your forgiveness." Dennis Vidal, 
staring at her, had turned dead white as she kept 
it up, and the quiet nobleness of her inspired pen 
ance had brought tears into Tony's eyes. She 
saw them there as she looked at him once more, 



 

and she measured the effect she produced upon 
him. She visibly and excusably enjoyed it, and 
after a moment's pause she handsomely and pa 
thetically completed it. "That, Mr. Bream for 
your injunction of kindness is the kindness I'm 
capable of showing." 

Tony turned instantly to their companion, who 
now stood staring hard at the ground. " I change, 
then, my appeal I make it, with confidence, to 
you. Let me hear, Mr. Vidal, when we meet 
again, that you've not been capable of less ! " 
Dennis, deeply moved, it was plain, but self-con 
scious and stiff, gave no sign of having heard him ; 
and Rose, on her side, walked away a little, like 
an actress who had launched her great stroke. 
Tony, between them, hesitated ; then he laughed 
in a manner that showed he felt safe. "Oh, 
you're both all right ! " he declared ; and with 
another glance at his watch he bounded off to 
his business. He drew, as he went, a long breath 
filled his lungs with the sense that he should 
after all have a margin. She would take Vidal 
back. 



XXIV 

" WHY did you do that ? " Dennis asked as soon 
as he was alone with Rose. 

She had sunk into a seat at a distance from him, 
all spent with her great response to her sudden 
opportunity for justice. His challenge brought 
her flight to earth; and after waiting a moment 
she answered him with a question that betrayed 
her sense of coming down. " Do you really care, 
after all this time, what I do or don't do ? " 

His rejoinder to this was in turn only another 
demand. "What business is it of his that you 
may have done this or that to me? What has 
passed between us is still between us : nobody else 
has anything to do with it." 

Rose smiled at him as if to thank him for being 
again a trifle sharp with her. " He wants me, as 
he said, to be kind to you." 

"You mean he wants you to do that sort of 
thing?" His sharpness brought him step by step 




 

across the lawn and nearer to her. " Do you care 
so very much what he wants? " 

Again she hesitated; then, with her pleased, 
patient smile, she tapped the empty place on the 
bench. " Come and sit down beside me, and I 'll
tell you how much I care." He obeyed her, but 
not precipitately, approaching her with a delibera 
tion which still held her off a little, made her ob 
jective to his inspection or his mistrust. He had 
said to Mrs. Beever that he had not come to watch 
her, but we are at liberty to wonder what Mrs. 
Beever might have called the attitude in which, 
before seating himself, he stopped before her with 
a silent stare. She met him at any rate with a 
face that told him there was no scrutiny she was 
now enough in the wrong to fear, a face that was 
all the promise of confession and submission and 
sacrifice. She tapped again upon her bench, and 
at this he sat down. Then she went on : " When 
did you come back?" 

"To England? The other day I don't re 
member which of them. I think you ought to 
answer my question," Vidal said, "before asking 
any more of your own." 

"No, no," she replied, promptly but gently; 
"there's an inquiry it seems to me I've a right 





to make of you before I admit yours to make any 
at all." She looked at him as if to give him time 
either to assent or to object; but he only sat 
rather stiffly back and let her see how fine and 
firm the added years had hammered him. " What 
are you really here for? Has it anything to do 
with me?" 

Dennis remained profoundly grave. "I didn't 
know you were here I had no reason to," he at 
last replied. 

" Then you simply desired the pleasure of renew 
ing your acquaintance with Mrs. Beever ? " 

" I came to ask her about you." 

" How beautiful of you ! " and Rose's tone, 
untinged with irony, rang out as clear as the 
impulse it praised. " Fancy your caring ! " she 
added; after which she continued: "As I under 
stand you, then, you've had your chance, you've 
talked with her." 

"A very short time. I put her a question or 
two." 

" I won't ask you what they were," said Rose : 
" I'll only say that, since I happen to be here, it 
may be a comfort to you not to have to content 
yourself with information at secondhand. Ask 
me what you like. I'll tell you everything." 



 

Her companion considered. " You might then 
begin by telling me what I've already asked." 

She took him up before he could go on. "Oh, 
why I attached an importance to his hearing what 
I just now said ? Yes, yes ; you shall have it." 
She turned it over as if with the sole thought of 
giving it to him with the utmost lucidity; then 
she was visibly struck with the help she would 
derive from knowing just one thing more. " But 
first are you at all jealous of him ? " 

Dennis Vidal broke into a laugh which might 
have been a tribute to her rare audacity, yet which 
somehow, at the same time, made him seem only 
more serious. " That's a thing for you to find out 
for yourself ! " 

" I see I see." She looked at him with mus 
ing, indulgent eyes. " It would be too wonderful. 
Yet otherwise, after all, why should you care ? " 

" I don't mind telling you frankly," said Dennis, 
while, with two fingers softly playing upon her 
lower lip, she sat estimating the possibility she 
had named "I don't mind telling you frankly 
that I asked Mrs. Beever if you were still in love 
with him." 

She clasped her hands so eagerly that she almost 
clapped them. " Then you do care ? " 





He was looking beyond her now at something 
at the other end of the garden ; and he made no 
other reply than to say: "She didn't give you 
away." 

" It was very good of her ; but I would tell you 
myself, you know, perfectly, if I were." 

" You didn't tell me perfectly four years ago," 
Dennis returned. 

Rose hesitated a minute; but this didn't pre 
vent her speaking with an effect of great prompti 
tude. " Oh, four years ago I was the biggest fool 
in England ! " 

Dennis, at this, met her eyes again. "Then 
what I asked Mrs. Beever " 

" Isn't true ? " Rose caught him up. " It's an 
exquisite position," she said, " for a woman to be 
questioned as you question me, and to have to 
answer as I answer you. But it's your revenge, 
and you've already seen that to your revenge 
I minister with a certain amount of resolution." 
She let him look at her a minute; at last she 
said without flinching: "I'm not in love with 
Anthony Bream." 

Dennis shook his head sadly. " What does that 
do for my revenge ? " 

Rose had another quick flush. "It shows you 



 

what I consent to discuss with you," she rather 
proudly replied. 

He turned his eyes back to the quarter to which 
he had directed them before. " You do consent? " 

" Can you ask after what I've done ? " 

" Well, then ; Tie no longer cares ? " 

" For me ?" said Rose. " He never cared." 

"Never?" 

" Never." 

" Upon your honour ? " 

" Upon my honour." 

" But you had an idea ? " Dennis bravely 

pursued. 

Rose as dauntlessly met him. " I had an idea." 

" And you've had to give it up ? " 

" I've had to give it up." 

Dennis was silent ; he slowly got upon his feet. 

" Well that does something." 

"For your revenge?" She sounded a bitter 
laugh. " I should think it might ! What it does 
is magnificent ! " 

He stood looking over her head till at last he 
exclaimed: "So, apparently, is the child !" 

" She has come ? " Rose sprang up to find that 
Effie had been borne toward them, across the 
grass, in the arms of the muscular Manning, who, 





having stooped to set her down and given her a 
vigorous impulsion from behind, recovered the 
military stature and posture. 

" You're to take her, Miss, please from Mrs. 
Beever. And you're to keep her." 

Rose had already greeted the little visitor. 
" Please assure Mrs. Beever that I will. She's 
with Miss Martle?" 

" She is indeed, Miss." Manning always spoke 
without emotion, and the effect of it on this occa 
sion was to give her the air of speaking without 
pity. 

Rose, however, didn't mind that. " She may 
trust me," she said, while Manning saluted and 
retired. Then she stood before her old suitor with 
Effie blooming on her shoulder. 

He frankly wondered and admired. " She's 
magnificent she's magnificent!" he repeated. 

" She's magnificent ! " Rose ardently echoed. 
" Aren't you, my very own ? " she demanded of 
the child with a sudden passion of tenderness. 

"What did he mean about her wanting the 
Doctor ? She'll see us all through every blessed 
one of us ! " Dennis gave himself up to his serious 
interest, an odd, voracious manner of taking her in 
from top to toe. 



 

" You look at her like an ogre ! " Rose laughed, 
moving away from him with her burden, and press 
ing to her lips, as she went, a little plump pink 
arm. She pretended to munch it; she covered 
it with kisses; she gave way to the joy of her 
renounced abstention. "See us all through? 
I hope so ! Why shouldn't you, darling why 
shouldn't you? You've got a real friend you 
have, you duck ; and she sees you know what 
you've got by the wonderful way you look at her ! " 
This was to attribute to the little girl's solemn 
stare a vividness of meaning which moved Dennis 
to hilarity ; Rose's profession of confidence made 
her immediately turn her round face, over her 
friend's shoulder, to the gentleman who was stroll 
ing behind and whose public criticism, as well as 
his public mirth, appeared to arouse in her only a 
soft sense of superiority. Rose sat down again 
where she had sat before, keeping Effie in her lap 
and smoothing out her fine feathers. Then their 
companion, after a little more detached contem 
plation, also took his former place. 

" She makes me remember ! " he presently 
observed. 

" That extraordinary scene poor Julia's mes 
sage ? You can fancy whether Iforget it ! " 





Dennis was silent a little ; after which he said 
quietly : " You've more to keep it in mind." 

" I can assure you I've plenty ! " Rose replied. 

" And the young lady who was also present : 
isn't she the Miss Martle ?" 

" Whom I spoke of to that woman ? She's the 
Miss Martle. What about her ? " Rose asked with 
her cheek against the child's. 

" Does she also remember ? " 

" Like you and me ? I haven't the least idea." 

Once more Dennis paused: his pauses were 
filled with his friendly gaze at their small compan 
ion. " She's here again like you ? " 

" And like you ? " Rose smiled. " No, not like 
either of us. She's always here." 

" And it's from her you're to keep a certain 
little person?" 

" It's from her." Rose spoke with rich brevity. 

Dennis hesitated. " Would you trust the little 
person to another little person ? " 

"To you to hold?" Rose looked amused. 
" Without a pang ! " The child, at this, pro 
foundly meditative and imperturbably " good," sub 
mitted serenely to the transfer and to the prompt, 
long kiss which, as he gathered her to him, Dennis, 
in his turn, imprinted on her arm. " I'll stay with 



 

you!" she declared with expression; on which he 
renewed, with finer relish, the freedom she per 
mitted, assuring her that this settled the question 
and that he was her appointed champion. Rose 
watched the passage between them, which was 
charming ; then she brought out abruptly : " What 
I said to Mr. Bream just now I didn't say for Mr. 
Bream." 

Dennis had the little girl close to him ; his arms 
were softly round her and, like Rose's just before, 
his cheek, as he tenderly bent his head, was pressed 
against her cheek. His eyes were on their com 
panion. "You said it for Mr. Vidal? He liked 
it, all the same, better than I," he replied in a 
moment. 

" Of course he liked it ! But it doesn't matter 
what he likes," Rose added. "As for you I 
don't know that your ' liking ' it was what I 
wanted." 

" What then did you want ? " 

" That you should see me utterly abased and 
all the more utterly that it was in the cruel pres 
ence of another." 

Dennis had raised his head and sunk back into 
the angle of the bench, separated from her by such 
space as it yielded. His face, presented to her 





over Effie's curls, was a lean mixture of many 
mystifications. "Why in the world should that 
give me pleasure?" 

"Why in the world shouldn't it ?" Rose asked. 
" What's your revenge but pleasure ? " 

She had got up again in her dire restlessness ; 
she glowed there in the perversity of her sacrifice. 
If he hadn't come to Wilverley to watch her, his 
wonder-stricken air much wronged him. He shook 
his head again with his tired patience. " Oh, damn 
pleasure ! " he exclaimed. 

" Your triumph's nothing to you ? " Rose cried. 
"Then if it isn't, perhaps you pity me?" She 
shone at him as if with the glimpse of a new 
hope. 

He took it in, but he only after a moment echoed 
ambiguously her word. " Pity you ? " 

"I think you would, Dennis, if you under 
stood." 

He looked at her hard; he hesitated. At last 
he returned quietly, but relentingly : " Well, Rose, 
I don't understand." 

" Then I must go through it all I must empty 
the cup. Yes, I must tell you." 

She paused so long, however, beautiful, candid, 
and tragic, looking in the face her necessity, but 



 

gathering herself for her effort, that, after waiting 
awhile, he spoke. " Tell me what ? " 

" That I'm simply at your feet. That I'm yours 
to do what you will with to take or to cast away. 
Perhaps you will care for your triumph," she said, 
" when you see in it the grand opportunity I give 
you. It's your turn to refuse now you can 
treat me exactly as you were treated ! " 

A deep, motionless silence followed, between 
them, this speech, which left them confronted as if 
it had rather widened than bridged their separa 
tion. Before Dennis found his answer to it the 
sharp tension snapped in a clear, glad exclamation. 
The child threw out her arms and her voice : 
" Auntie Jean, Auntie Jean ! " 



XXV 

THE others had been so absorbed that they 
had not seen Jean Martle approach, and she, on 
her side, was close to them before appearing to 
perceive a stranger in the gentleman who held 
Effie in his lap and whom she had the air of 
having assumed, at a greater distance, to be 
Anthony Bream. Effie's reach toward her friend 
was so effective that, with Vidal's obligation to 
rise, it enabled her to slip from his hands and 
rush to avail herself of the embrace offered 
her, in spite of a momentary arrest, by Jean. 
Rose, however, at the sight of this movement, 
was quicker than Jean to catch her; she seized 
her almost with violence, and, holding her as 
she had held her before, dropped again upon 
the bench and presented her as a yielding cap 
tive. This act of appropriation was confirmed 
by the flash of a fine glance a single gleam, 
but direct which, however, producing in Jean's 




 

fair face no retort, had only the effect of mak 
ing her look, in gracious recognition, at Dennis. 
He had evidently, for the moment, nothing but 
an odd want of words to meet her with; but 
this, precisely, gave her such a sense of having 
disturbed a scene of intimacy that, to be doubly 
courteous, she said : " Perhaps you remember 
me. We were here together " 

"Four years ago perfectly," Rose broke in, 
speaking for him with an amenity that might 
have been intended as a quick corrective of 
any impression conveyed by her grab of the 
child. "Mr. Vidal and I were just talking of 
you. He has come back, for the first time since 
then, to pay us a little visit." 

" Then he has things to say to you that I've 
rudely interrupted. Please excuse me I'm off 
again," Jean went on to Dennis. "I only came 
for the little girl." She turned back to Rose. 
"I'm afraid it's time I should take her home." 

Rose sat there like a queen-regent with a 
baby sovereign on her knee. "Must I give her 
up to you?" 

"I'm responsible for her, you know, to Gor- 
ham," Jean returned. 

Rose gravely kissed her little ward, who, now 





that she was apparently to be offered the enter 
tainment of a debate in which she was so 
closely concerned, was clearly prepared to con 
tribute to it the calmness of impartial beauty 
at a joust. She was just old enough to be in 
terested, but she was just young enough to be 
judicial; the lap of her present friend had the 
compass of a small child-world, and she perched 
there in her loveliness as if she had been Helen 
on the walls of Troy. " It's not to Gorham J'm 
responsible," Rose presently answered. 

Jean took it good-humouredly. "Are you to 
Mr. Bream?" 

" I'll tell you presently to whom." And Rose 
looked intelligently at Dennis Vidal. 

Smiled at in alternation by two clever young 
women, he had yet not, sufficiently to achieve 
a jocose manner, shaken off his sense of the 
strange climax of his conversation with the 
elder of them. He turned about awkwardly, 
as he had done four years before, for the hat 
it was one of the privileges of such a collo 
quy to make him put down in an odd place. 
"I'll go over to Bounds," he said to Rose. 
And then to Jean, to take leave of her: "I'm 
staying at the other house." 



 

"Really? Mr. Bream didn't tell me. But I 
must never drive you away. You've more to 
say to Miss Armiger than I have. I've only 
come to get Effie," Jean repeated. 

Dennis at this, brushing off his recovered hat, 
gave way to his thin laugh. "That, apparently, 
may take you some time ! " 

Rose generously helped him off. "I've more 
to say to Miss Martle than I've now to say to 
you. I think that what I've already said to 
you is quite enough." 

" Thanks, thanks quite enough. I'll just 
go over." 

"You won't go first to Mrs. Beever?" 

" Not yet I'll come in this evening. Thanks, 
thanks ! " Dennis repeated with a sudden dra 
matic gaiety that was presumably intended to 
preserve appearances to acknowledge Rose's 
aid and, in a spirit of reciprocity, cover any 
exposure she might herself have incurred. Rais 
ing his hat, he passed down the slope and 
disappeared, leaving our young ladies face to 
face. 

Their situation might still have been embar 
rassing had Rose not taken immediate measures 
to give it a lift. "You must let me have the 





pleasure of making you the first person to hear 
of a matter that closely concerns me." She 
hung fire, watching her companion ; then she 
brought out: "I'm engaged to be married to 
Mr. Vidal." 

" Engaged ? " Jean almost bounded forward, 
holding up her relief like a torch. 

Rose greeted with laughter this natural note. 
" He arrived half an hour ago, for a supreme 
appeal and it has not, you see, taken long. 
I've just had the honour of accepting him." 

Jean's movement had brought her so close to 
the bench that, though slightly disconcerted by 
its action on her friend, she could only, in con 
sistency, seat herself. "That's very charming 
I congratulate you." 

"It's charming of you to be so glad," Rose 
returned. "However, you've the news in all 
its freshness." 

" I appreciate that too," said Jean. " But 
fancy my dropping on a conversation of such 
importance ! " 

" Fortunately you didn't cut it short. We had 
settled the question. He had got his answer." 

"If I had known it I would have congratu 
lated Mr. Vidal," Jean pursued. 



 

" You would have frightened him out of his 
wits he's so dreadfully shy ! " Rose laughed. 

" Yes I could see he was dreadfully shy. 
But the great thing," Jean candidly added, "is 
that he was not too dreadfully shy to come 
back to you." 

Rose continued to be moved to mirth. " Oh, 
I don't mean with me! He's as bold with me 
as I am for instance with you." Jean had 
not touched the child, but Rose smoothed out 
her ribbons as if to redress some previous free 
dom. " You'll think that says everything. I 
can easily imagine how you judge my frank 
ness," she added. "But of course I'm grossly 
immodest I always was." 

Jean wistfully watched her light hands play 
here and there over Effie's adornments. "I 
think you're a person of great courage if 
you'll let me also be frank. There's nothing 
in the world I admire so much for I don't 
consider that I've, myself, a great deal. I dare 
say, however, that I should let you know just 
as soon if I were engaged." 

"Which, unfortunately, is exactly what you're 
not ! " Rose, having finished her titivation of 
the child, sank comfortably back on the bench. 





"Do you object to my speaking to you of 
that?" she asked. 

Jean hesitated; she had only after letting 
them escape become conscious of the reach of 
her words, the inadvertence of which showed 
how few waves of emotion her scene with Paul
