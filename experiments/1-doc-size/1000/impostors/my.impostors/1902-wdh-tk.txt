" Why, there 's nothing to say about me," she 



 

began, in compliance with his gayety, and then she 
fell helpless from it. 

" Well, then, about Tuskingum. I should like to 
hear about Tuskingum, so much !" 

" I suppose we like it because we ve always lived 
there. You haven 't been much in the West, have 
you?" 

"Not as much as I hope to be." He had found 
that Western people were sometimes sensitive con 
cerning their section and were prepared to resent 
complacent ignorance of it. " I ve always thought 
it must be very interesting." 

" It isn t," said the girl. " At least, not like the 
East. I used to be provoked when the lecturers 
said anything like that; but when you ve been to 
New York you see what they mean." 

" The lecturers ?" he queried. 

" They always stayed at our house when they lect 
ured in Tuskingum." 

"Ah! Oh yes," said Breckon, grasping a situ 
ation of which he had heard something, chiefly sa 
tirical. " Of course. And is your father is Judge 
Kenton literary ? Excuse me !" 

" Only in his history. He 's writing the history 
of his regiment; or he gets the soldiers to write 
down all they can remember of the war, and then 
he puts their stories together." 

"How delightful!" said Breckon. "And I sup 
pose it 's a great pleasure to him." 

" I don 't believe it is," said Ellen. " Poppa doesn 't 
believe in war any more." 



 

" Indeed!" said Breckon. " That is very interest 
ing." 

" Sometimes when I 'm helping him with it " 

" Ah, I knew you must help him I" 

"And he comes to a place where there has been 
a dreadful slaughter, it seems as if he felt worse 
about it than I did. He isn 't sure that it wasn 't 
all wrong. He thinks all war is wrong now." 

" Is he has he become a follower of Tolstoy ?" 

" He 's read him. He says he 's the only man that 
ever gave a true account of battles; but he had 
thought it all out for himself before he read Tol 
stoy about fighting. Do you think it is right to 
revenge an injury ?" 

" Why, surely not !" said Breckon, rather startled. 

" That is what we say" the girl pursued. " But 
if some one had injured you abused your confi 
dence, and insulted you, what would you do?" 

" I 'm not sure that I understand," Breckon began. 
The inquiry was superficially impersonal, but he 
reflected that women are never impersonal, or the 
sons of women, for that matter, and he suspected 
an intimate ground. His suspicions were confirmed 
when Miss Kenton said: "It seems easy enough to 
forgive anything that 's done to yourself; but if it 's 
done to some one else, too, have you the right 
isn 't it wrong to let it go ?" 

" You think the question of justice might come 
in then? Perhaps it ought. But what is justice? 
And where does your duty begin to be divided ?" He 
saw her following him with alarming intensity, and 



 

he shrank from the responsibility before him. What 
application might not she make of his words in 
the case, whatever it was, which he chose not to 
imagine ? " To tell you the truth, Miss Kenton, 
I 'm not very clear on that point I 'm not sure that 
I 'm disinterested." 

"Disinterested?" 

" Yes ; you know that I abused your confidence 
at luncheon; and until I know whether the wrong 
involved any one else " He looked at her with 
hovering laughter in his eyes which took wing at 
the reproach in hers. "But if we are to be seri 
ous" 

" Oh no," she said, " it isn 't a serious matter." 
But in the helplessness of her sincerity she could 
not carry it off lightly, or hide from him that she 
was disappointed. 

He tried to make talk about other things. She 
responded vaguely, and when she had given herself 
time she said she believed she would go to Lottie; 
she was quite sure she could get down the stairs 
alone. He pursued her anxiously, politely, and at 
the head of her corridor took leave of her with a 
distinct sense of having merited his dismissal. 

" I see what you mean, Lottie," she said, " about 
Mr. Breckon." 

Lottie did not turn her head on the pillow. " Has 
it taken you the whole day to find it out ?" 



XII 



THE father and the mother had witnessed with 
tempered satisfaction the interest which seemed 
to be growing up between Ellen and the young 
minister. By this time they had learned not to 
expect too much of any turn she might take; she 
reverted to a mood as suddenly as she left it. They 
could not quite make out Breckon himself; he was 
at least as great a puzzle to them as their own child 
was. 

" It seems," said Mrs. Kenton, in their first review 
of the affair, after Boyne had done a brother 's duty 
in trying to bring Ellen under their mother 's cen 
sure, " that he was the gentleman who discussed the 
theatre with Boyne at the vaudeville last winter. 
Boyne just casually mentioned it. I was so pro 
voked!" 

" I don 't see what bearing the fact has," the judge 
remarked. 

"Why, Boyne liked him very much that night, 
but now he seems to feel very much as Lottie does 
about him. He thinks he laughs too much." 

"I don 't know that there 's much harm in that," 
said the judge. "And I shouldn 't value Boyne 's 
opinion of character very highly." 



 

" I value any one 's intuitions especially chil 
dren s." 

"Boyne 's in that middle state where he isn 't 
quite a child. And so is Lottie, for that matter." 

" That is true," their mother assented. " And 
we ought to be glad of anything that takes Ellen 's 
mind off herself. If I could only believe she was 
forgetting that wretch!" 

" Does she ever speak of him ?" 

" She never hints of him, even. But her mind 
may be full of him all the time." 

The judge laughed impatiently. "It strikes me 
that this young Mr. Breckon hasn 't much advantage 
of Ellen in what Lottie calls closeness." 

" Ellen has always been very reserved. It would 
have been better for her if she hadn t. Oh, I scarce 
ly dare to hope anything! Rufus, I feel that in 
everything of this kind we are very ignorant and 
inexperienced." 

" Inexperienced !" Kenton retorted. " I don 't want 
any more experience of the kind Ellen has given 
us." 

" I don 't mean that. I mean this Mr. Breckon. 
I can 't tell what attracts him in the child. She 
must appear very crude and uncultivated to him. 
You needn 't resent it so ! I know she 's read a great 
deal, and you ve made her think herself intellectual 
but the very simple-heartedness of the way she 
would show out her reading would make such a 
young man see that she wasn 't like the girls he 
was used to. They would hide their intellectual- 



 

ity, if they had any. It 's no use your trying to 
fight it, Mr. Kenton. We are country people, and 
he knows it." 

" Tuskingum isn 't country ?" the judge declared. 

" It isn 't city. And we don 't know anything about 
the world, any of us. Oh, I suppose we can read 
and write! But we don 't know the a, b, c of the 
things he knows. He belongs to a kind of society 
of people in New York that I had glimpses 
of in the winter, but that I never imagined before. 
They made me feel very belated and benighted 
as if I hadn 't read or thought anything. They 
didn 't mean to; but I couldn 't help it, and they 
couldn t." 

"You you ve been frightened out of your pro 
priety by what you ve seen in New York," said her 
husband. 

" I ve been frightened, certainly. And I wish 
you had been, too. I wish you wouldn 't be so con 
ceited about Ellen. It scares me to see you so. 
Poor, sick thing, her looks are all gone! You must 
see that. And she doesn 't dress like the girls he 's 
used to. I know we ve got her things in New York ; 
but she doesn 't wear them like a New-Yorker. I 
hope she isn 't going in for more unhappiness !" 

At the thought of this the judge 's crest fell. " Do 
you believe she 's getting interested in him?" he 
asked, humbly. 

" No, no ; I don 't say that. But promise me you 
won 't encourage her in it. And don t, for pity 's 
sake, brag about her to him." 



 

" No, I won t," said the judge, and he tacitly 're 
pented having done so. 

The weather had changed, and when he went up 
from this interview with his wife in their state 
room he found a good many people strung con- 
valescently along the promenade on their steamer- 
chairs. These, so far as they were women, were 
of such sick plainness that when he came to Ellen 
his heart throbbed with a glad resentment of her 
mother 's aspersion of her health and beauty. She 
looked not only very well, and very pretty, but in 
a gay red cap and a trig jacket she looked, to her 
father 's uncritical eyes, very stylish. The glow left 
his heart at sight of the empty seat beside her. 

" Where is Lottie ?" he asked, though it was not 
Lottie 's whereabouts that interested him. 

" Oh, she 's walking with Mr. Breckon somewhere," 
said Ellen. 

" Then she 's made up her mind to tolerate him, 
has she ?" the father asked, more lightly than he felt. 

Ellen smiled. " That wasn 't anything very seri 
ous, I guess. At any rate, she 's walking with him." 

"What book is that?" he asked, of the volume 
she was tilting back and forth under her hand. 

She showed it. " One of his. He brought it up 
to amuse me, he said." 

"While he was amusing himself with Lottie," 
thought the judge, in his jealousy for her. "It 
is going the same old way. Well!" What he said 
aloud was, " And is it amusing you ?" 

" I haven 't looked at it yet," said the girl. " It 's 



 

amusing enough to watch the sea. Oh, poppa! I 
never thought I should care so much for it." 

" And you 're glad we came ?" 

"I don 't want to think about that, I just want 
to know that I 'm here." She pressed his arm gently, 
significantly, where he sat provisionally in the chair 
beside her, and he was afraid to speak lest he should 
scare away the hope her words gave him. 

He merely said, " Well, well !" and waited for her 
to speak further. But her impulse had exhausted 
itself, as if her spirit were like one of those weak 
forms of life which spend their strength in a quick 
run or flight, and then rest to gather force for 
another. "Where 's Boyne?" he asked, after wait 
ing for her to speak. 

" He was here a minute ago. He 's been talking 
with some of the deck passengers that are going 
home because they couldn 't get on in America. 
Doesn 't that seem pitiful, poppa? I always thought 
we had work enough for the whole world." 

" Perhaps these fellows didn 't try very hard to 
find it," said the judge. 

" Perhaps," she assented. 

" I shouldn 't want you to get to thinking that 
it 's all like New York. Remember how comfortable 
everybody is in Tuskingum." 

" Yes," she said, sadly. " How far off Tuskingum 
seems !" 

"Well, don 't forget about it; and remember that 
wherever life is simplest and purest and kindest, 
that is the highest civilization." 



 

" How much like old times it seems to hear you 
talk that way, poppa! I should think I was in the 
library at home. And I made you leave it!" she 
sighed. 

"Your mother was glad of any excuse. And it 
will do us all good, if we take it in the right way," 
said the judge, with a didactic severity that did not 
hide his pang from her. 

" Poor poppa !" she said. 

He went away, saying that he was going to look 
Lottie up. His simple design was to send Lottie 
to her mother, so that Breckon might come back to 
Ellen ; but he did not own this to himself. 

Lottie returned from another direction with 
Boyne, and Ellen said, " Poppa 's gone to look for 
you." 

"Has he?" asked Lottie, dropping decisively into 
her chair. " Well, there 's one thing ; I won 't call 
him poppa any more." 

"What will you call him?" Boyne demanded, 
demurely. 

" I 'll call him father, if you want to know ; and 
I 'm going to call momma mother. I 'm not going 
to have those English laughing at us, and I won 't 
say papa and mamma. Everybody that knows any 
thing says father and mother now." 

Boyne kept looking from one sister to another 
during Lottie 's declaration, and, with his eyes on 
Ellen, he said, "It 's true, Ellen. All the Plump- 
tons did." He was very serious. 

Ellen smiled. " I 'm too old to change. I d rather 
 



 

seem queer in Europe than when I get back to 
Tuskingum." 

"You wouldn 't be queer there a great while," 
said Lottie. " They 'll all be doing it in a week 
after I get home." 

Upon the encouragement given him by Ellen, 
Boyne seized the chance of being of the opposition. 
"Yes," he taunted Lottie, "and you think they 'll 
say woman and man, for lady and gentleman, I 
suppose." 

" They will as soon as they know it 's the thing." 

"Well, I know I won t," said Boyne. "I won 't 
call momma a woman." 

"It doesn 't matter what you do, Boyne dear," 
his sister serenely assured him. 

While he stood searching his mind for a suitable 
retort, a young man, not apparently many years 
his senior, came round the corner of the music- 
room, and put himself conspicuously in view at a 
distance from the Kentons. 

" There he is, now" said Boyne. " He wants 
to be introduced to Lottie." He referred the ques 
tion to Ellen, but Lottie answered for her. 

" Then why don 't you introduce him ?" 

" Well, I would if he was an American. But 
you can 't tell about these English." He resumed 
the dignity he had lost in making the explanation 
to Lottie, and ignored her in turning again to 
Ellen. "What do you think, Ellen?" 

" Oh, I don 't know about such things, Boyne," 
she said, shrinking from the responsibility. 



 

"Well, upon my word!" cried Lottie. "If Ellen 
can talk by the hour with that precious Mr. Breckon, 
and stay up here along with him, when everybody 
else is down below sick, I don 't think she can have 
a great deal to say about a half-grown boy like that 
being introduced to me." 

" He 's as old as you are," said Boyne, hotly. 

" Oh ! I saw him associating with you, and I 
thought he was a boy, too. Pardon me!" Lottie 
turned from giving Boyne his coup-de-grace, to 
plant a little stab in Ellen 's breast. " To be sure, 
now Mr. Breckon has found those friends of his, I 
suppose he won 't want to flirt with Ellen any more." 

"Ah, ha, ha!" Boyne broke in. "Lottie is mad 
because he stopped to speak to some ladies he knew. 
Women, I suppose she d call them." 

"Well, I shouldn 't call him a gentleman, any 
way," said Lottie. 

The pretty, smooth-faced, fresh-faced young fel 
low whom their varying debate had kept in abey 
ance, looked round at them over his shoulder as 
he leaned on the rail, and seemed to discover Boyne 
for the first time. He came promptly towards the 
Kentons. 

" Now," said Lottie, rapidly, " you 'll just have to." 

The young fellow touched his cap to the whole 
group, but he ventured to address only Boyne. 

" Every one seems to be about this morning," he 
said, with the cheery English-rising inflection. 

" Yes," answered Boyne, with such snubbing cold 
ness that Ellen 's heart was touched. 



 

"It 's so pleasant," she said, "after that dark 
weather." 

"Isn 't it?" cried the young fellow, gratefully. 
" One doesn 't often get such sunshine as this at 
sea, you know." 

"My sister, Miss Kenton, Mr. Pogis," Boyne 
solemnly intervened. "And Miss Lottie Ken- 
ton." 

The pretty boy bowed to each in turn, but he 
made no pretence of being there to talk with Ellen. 
"Have you been ill, too?" he actively addressed 
himself to Lottie. 

"No, just mad," she said. "I wasn 't very sick, 
and that made it all the worse being down in a 
poky state-room when I wanted to walk." 

"And I suppose you ve been making up for lost 
time this morning?" 

" Not half," said Lottie. 

"Oh, do finish the half with me!" 

Lottie instantly rose, and flung her sister the 
wrap she had been holding ready to shed from the 
moment the young man had come up. " Keep that 
for me, Nell. Are you good at catching ?" she asked 
him. 

"Catching?" 

"Yes! People," she explained, and at a sudden 
twist of the ship she made a clutch at his shoul 
der. 

"Oh! I think I can catch you." 

As they moved off together, Boyne said, "Well, 
upon my word!" but Ellen did not say anything 



 

in comment on Lottie. After a while she asked, 
" Who were the ladies that Mr. Breckon met ?" 

"I didn 't hear their names. They were some 
body he hadn 't seen before since the ship started. 
They looked like a young lady and her mother. 
It made Lottie mad when he stopped to speak with 
them, and she wouldn 't wait till he could get 
through. Kan right away, and made me come, 
too." 




XIII 

BRECKON had not seen the former interest between 
himself and Ellen lapse to commonplace acquaint 
ance without due sense of loss. He suffered justly, 
but he did not suffer passively, or without several 
attempts to regain the higher ground. In spite of 
these he was aware of being distinctly kept to the 
level which he accused himself of having chosen, 
by a gentle acquiescence in his choice more fatal 
than snubbing. The advances that he made across 
the table, while he still met Miss Kenton alone 
there, did not carry beyond the rack supporting 
her plate. She talked on whatever subject he start 
ed with that angelic sincerity which now seemed 
so far from him, but she started none herself; she 
did not appeal to him for his opinion upon any 
question more psychological than the barometer; 
and, 

"In a tumultuous privacy of storm," 

he found himself as much estranged from her as 
if a fair-weather crowd had surrounded them. He 
did not believe that she resented the levity he had 
shown; but he had reason to fear that she had 
finally accepted it as his normal mood, and in her 
efforts to meet him in it, as if he had no other, 



 

he read a tolerance that was worse than contempt. 
When he tried to make her think differently, if 
that was what she thought of him, he fancied her 
rising to the notion he wished to give her, and then 
shrinking from it, as if it must bring her the dis 
appointment of some trivial joke. 

It was what he had taught her to expect of him, 
and he had himself to blame. Now that he had 
thrown that precious chance away, he might well 
have overvalued it. She had certain provincial 
isms which he could not ignore. She did not know 
the right use of will and shall, and would and 
should, and she pronounced the letter r with a 
hard mid- Western twist. Her voice was weak and 
thin, and she could not govern it from being at 
times a gasp and at times a drawl. She did not 
dress with the authority of women who know more 
of their clothes than the people they buy them of; 
she did not carry herself like a pretty girl; she 
had not the definite stamp of young-ladyism. Yet 
she was undoubtedly a lady in every instinct; she 
wore with pensive grace the clothes which she 
had not subjected to her personal taste; and if she 
did not carry herself like a pretty girl, she had a 
beauty which touched and entreated. 

More and more Breckon found himself studying 
her beauty her soft, brown brows, her gentle, dark 
eyes, a little sunken, and with the lids pinched 
by suffering; the cheeks somewhat thin, but not 
colorless; the long chin, the clear forehead, and 
the massed brown hair, that seemed too heavy for 



 

the drooping neck. It was not the modern athletic 
type ; it was rather of the earlier period, when beau 
ty was associated with the fragility despised by a 
tanned and golfing generation. Ellen Kenton 's 
wrists were thin, and her hands long and narrow. 
As he looked at her across the racks during those 
two days of storm, he had sometimes the wish to 
take her long, narrow hands in his, and beg her to 
believe that he was worthier her serious friendship 
than he had shown himself. What he was sure 
of at all times now was that he wished to know the 
secret of that patient pathos of hers. She was not 
merely, or primarily, an invalid. Her family had 
treated her as an invalid, but, except Lottie, whose 
rigor might have been meant sanatively, they treat 
ed her more with the tenderness people use with 
a wounded spirit; and Breckon fancied moments 
of something like humility in her, when she seemed 
to cower from his notice. These were not so imag 
inable after her family took to their berths and 
left her alone with him, but the touching mystery 're 
mained, a sort of bewilderment, as he guessed it, a 
surprise such as a child might show at some incom 
prehensible harm. It was this grief which he had 
refused not merely to know he still doubted his 
right to know it but to share; he had denied not 
only his curiosity but his sympathy, and had exiled 
himself to a region where, when her family came 
back with the fair weather, he felt himself farther 
from her than before their acquaintance began. 
He had made an overture to its renewal in the 



 

book he lent her, and then Mrs. Rasmith and her 
daughter had appeared on deck, and borne down 
upon him when he was walking with Lottie Kenton 
and trying to begin his self-retrieval through her. 
She had left him; but they had not, and in the 
bonds of a prophet and his followers he found him 
self bound with them for much more conversation 
than he had often held with them ashore. The 
parochial duties of an ethical teacher were not 
strenuous, and Breckon had not been made to 
feel them so definitely before. Mrs. Rasmith held 
that they now included promising to sit at her 
table for the rest of the voyage; but her daughter 
succeeded in releasing him from the obligation; 
and it was she who smilingly detached the clinging 
hold of the elder lady. " We mustn 't keep Mr. 
Breckon from his friends, mother," she said, bright 
ly, and then he said he should like the pleasure of 
introducing them, and both of the ladies declared 
that they would be delighted. 

He bowed himself off, and half the ship s-length 
away he was aware, from meeting Lottie with her 
little Englishman, that it was she and not Ellen 
whom he was seeking. As the couple paused in 
whirring past Breckon long enough to let Lottie 
make her hat fast against the wind, he heard the 
Englishman shout: 

"I say, that sister of yours is a fine girl, isn 't 
she?" 

" She 's a pretty good - looker," Lottie answered 
back. "What 's the matter with her sister?" 



 

" Oh, I say !" her companion returned, in a trans 
port with her slangy pertness, which Breckon could 
not altogether refuse to share. 

He thought that he ought to condemn it, and he 
did condemn Mrs. Kenton for allowing it in one 
of her daughters, when he came up to her sitting 
beside another whom he felt inexpressibly incap 
able of it. Mrs. Kenton could have answered his 
censure, if she had known it, that daughters, like 
sons, were not what their mothers but what their 
environments made them, and that the same en 
vironment sometimes made them different, as he 
saw. She could have told him that Lottie, with 
her slangy pertness, had the truest and best of 
the men she knew at her feet, and that Ellen, 
with her meekness, had been the prey of the com 
monest and cheapest spirit in her world, and so left 
him to make an inference as creditable to his sex 
as he could. But this bold defence was as far from 
the poor lady as any spoken reproach was from 
him. Her daughter had to check in her a mechani 
cal offer to rise, as if to give Breckon her place, 
the theory and practice of Tuskingum being that 
their elders ought to leave young people alone 
together. 

" Don 't go, momma," Ellen whispered. " I don 't 
want you to go." 

Breckon, when he arrived before them, remained 
talking on foot, and, unlike Lottie 's company, he 
talked to the mother. This had happened before 
from him, but she had not got used to it, and 



 

now she deprecated in everything but words his 
polite questions about her sufferings from the rough 
weather, and his rejoicing that the worst was prob 
ably over. She ventured the hope that it was so, 
for she said that Mr. Kenton had about decided 
to keep on to Holland, and it seemed to her that 
they had had enough of storms. He said he was 
glad that they were going right on; and then 
she modestly recurred to the earlier opinion he had 
given her husband that it would be better to spend 
the rest of the summer in Holland than to go 
to Italy, as if she wished to conform herself in the 
wisdom of Mr. Kenton 's decision. He repeated 
his conviction, and he said that if he were in their 
place he should go to The Hague as soon as they 
had seen Rotterdam, and make it their headquarters 
for the exploration of the whole country. 

"You can 't realize how little it is; you can get 
anywhere in an hour; the difficulty is to keep in 
side of Holland when you leave any given point. 
I envy you going there." 

Mrs. Kenton inferred that he was going to 
stop in France, but if it were part of his close 
ness not to tell, it was part of her pride not to 
ask. She relented when he asked if he might 
get a map of his and prove the littleness of 
Holland from it, and in his absence she could 
not well avoid saying to Ellen, "He seems very 
pleasant." 

"Yes; why not?" the girl asked. 

"I don 't know. Lottie is so against him." 



 

" He was very kind when you were all sick." 

"Well, you ought to know better than Lottie; 
you ve seen him so much more." Ellen was silent, 
and her mother advanced cautiously, "I suppose 
he is very cultivated." 

"How can I tell? I 'm not." 

" Why, Ellen, I think you are. Very few girls 
have read so much." 

"Yes, but he wouldn 't care if I were cultivated. 
He is like all the rest. He would like to joke and 
laugh. Well, I think that is nice, too, and I wish 
I could do it. But I never could, and now I can 't 
try. I suppose he wonders what makes me such 
a dead weight on you all." 

"You know you 're not that, Ellen! You musn 't 
let yourself be morbid. It hurts me to have you say 
such things." 

" Well, I should like to tell him why, and see what 
he would say." 

"Ellen!" 

" Why not ? If he is a minister he must have 
thought about all kinds of things. Do you suppose 
he ever knew of a girl before who had been through 
what I have? Yes, I would like to know what he 
would really say." 

" I know what he ought to say ! If he knew, 
he would say that no girl had ever behaved more 
angelically." 

"Do you think he would? Perhaps he would 
say that if I hadn 't been so proud and silly Here 
he comes ! Shall we ask him ?" 



 

Breckon approached with his map, and her 
mother gasped, thinking how terrible such a thing 
would be if it could be; Ellen smiled brightly 
up at him. "Will you take my chair? And then 
you can show momma your map. I am going 
down," and while he was still protesting she was 
gone. 

" Miss Kenton seems so much better than she 
did the first day," he said, as he spread the map 
out on his knees, and gave Mrs. Kenton one end 
to hold. 

"Yes," the mother assented, as she bent over 
to look at it. 

She followed his explanation with a surface sense, 
while her nether mind was full of the worry of the 
question which Ellen had planted in it. What 
would such a man think of what she had been 
through? Or, rather, how would he say to her the 
only things that in Mrs. Kenton 's belief he could 
say? How could the poor child ever be made to 
see it in the light of some mind not colored with 
her family 's affection for her? An immense, an 
impossible longing possessed itself of the mother 's 
heart, which became the more insistent the more 
frantic it appeared. She uttered " Yes " and " No " 
and "Indeed" to what he was saying, but all the 
time she was rehearsing Ellen 's story in her inner 
sense. In the end she remembered so little what 
had actually passed that her dramatic reverie seem 
ed the reality, and when she left him she got her 
self down to her state-room, giddy with the shame 



 

and fear of her imaginary self -betrayal. She wished 
to test the enormity, and yet not find it so mon 
strous, by submitting the case to her husband, and 
she could scarcely keep back her impatience at 
seeing Ellen instead of her father. 

"Momma, what have you been saying to Mr. 
Breckon about me ?" 

"Nothing," said Mrs. Kenton, aghast at first, 
and then astonished to realize that she was speak 
ing the simple truth. " He said how much better 
you were looking; but I don 't believe I spoke a 
single word. We were looking at the map." 

"Very well," Ellen resumed. "I have been 
thinking it all over, and now I have made up my 
mind." 

She paused, and her mother asked, tremulously, 
"About what, Ellen?" 

" You know, momma. I see it all now. And don 't 
be afraid that I care anything about him now " 
and her mother knew that she meant Bittridge 
" or that I ever shall. That 's gone forever. But 
it 's gone," she added, and her mother quaked in 
wardly to hear her reason, " because the wrong and 
the shame was all for me for us. That 's why I 
can forgive it, and forget. If we had done any 
thing, the least thing in the world, to revenge our 
selves, or to hurt him, then Don 't you see, 
momma ?" 

"I think I see, Ellen." 

"Then I should have to keep thinking about it, 
and what we had made him suffer, and whether we 



 

hadn 't given him some claim. I don 't wish ever 
to think of him again. You and poppa were so 
patient and forbearing, all through; and I thank 
goodness now for everything you put up with; only 
I wish I could have borne everything myself." 

"You had enough to bear," Mrs. Kenton said, 
in tender evasion. 

" I 'm glad that I had to bear so much, for bearing 
it is what makes me free now." She went up to her 
mother and kissed her, and gazed into her face with 
joyful, tearful looks that made her heart sink.

MRS. KENTON did not rest till she had made sure 
from Lottie and Boyne that neither of them had 
dropped any hint to Ellen of what happened to 
Bittridge after his return to Tuskingum. She did 
not explain to them why she was so very anxious 
to know, but only charged them the more solemnly 
not to let the secret, which they had all been keeping 
from Ellen, escape them. 

They promised, but Lottie said, " She 's got to 
know it some time, and I should think the sooner 
the better." 

" I will be judge of that, Lottie," said her mother, 
and Boyne seized his chance of inculpating her 
with his friend, Mr. Pogis. He said she was carrying 
on awfully with him already; and an Englishman 
could not understand, and Boyne hinted that he 
would presume upon her American freedom. 

"Well, if he does, I 'll get you to cowhide him, 
Boyne," she retorted, and left him fuming help 
lessly, while she went to give the young Englishman 
an opportunity of resuming the flirtation which her 
mother had interrupted. 

With her husband Mrs. Kenton found it practi 
cable to be more explicit. "I haven 't had such 



 

a load lifted off my heart since I don 't know when. 
It shows me what I ve thought all along: that Ellen 
hasn 't really cared anything for that miserable 
thing since he first began going with Mrs. Uphill 
a year ago. When he wrote that letter to her in 
New York she wanted to be sure she didn t, and 
when he offered himself and misbehaved so to both 
of you, she was afraid that she and you were some 
how to blame. Now she 's worked it out that no one 
else was wronged, and she is satisfied. It 's made 
her feel free, as she says. But, oh, dear me I" Mrs. 
Kenton broke off, "I talk as if there was nothing 
to bind her; and yet there is what poor Richard 
did! What would she say if she knew that? I 
have been cautioning Lottie and Boyne, but I 
know it will come out somehow. Do you think it 's 
wise to keep it from her? Hadn 't we better tell 
her? Or shall we wait and see " 

Kenton would not allow to her or to himself that 
his hopes ran with hers; love is not business with a 
man as it is with a woman ; he feels it indecorous and 
indelicate to count upon it openly, where she thinks 
it simply a chance of life, to be considered like an 
other. All that Kenton would say was, "I see no 
reason for telling her just yet. She will have to know 
in due time. But let her enjoy her freedom now." 

"Yes," Mrs. Kenton doubtfully assented. 

The judge was thoughtfully silent. Then he said : 
"Few girls could have worked out her problem as 
Ellen has. Think how differently Lottie would 
have done it!" 
 



 

" Lottie has her good points, too," said Mrs. Ken- 
ton. " And, of course, I don 't blame Richard. There 
are all kinds of girls, and Lottie means no more 
harm than Ellen does. She 's the kind that can 't 
help attracting; but I always knew that Ellen was 
attractive, too, if she would only find it out. And 
I knew that as soon as anything worth while took 
up her mind she would never give that wretch 
another thought."
