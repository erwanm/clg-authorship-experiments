or asphodel? The lane led to a miraculous pasture here in 
the outskirts of the town, pine woods, a violet bank in the 
early days of the year, and a spring. But in the midst was a 
circular knoll, and this was where they were wont to come 
to sit, and here nested the birds who had found out that in 
Winterbourne's woods they were never shot. There was a 
peculiar orchestral effect of them here, as if the way the val- 
ley lay drew in sounds from all woodland quarters, and in 
the evening it was brave to hear the " kling " of the thrush, 
and fancy you were in deeper coverts. 

Catherine knew its beauties and repute, and that the way 
to it even, the winding lane with roses and tangled black- 
berry, was like a road to summer; but to-day the forms of 
things rose darkly before her eyes, and the smoke of glory, 
as from an altar where beauty burns before high God, was 
absent. But still he bore her along, talking a little, in his 
big voice that sounded louder than it need, and she could 
not answer. Winterbournc never heeded that from anybody. 
He was of the race of the born soliloquist. What he said 
was the innocently egotistic expression of his own mind, like 
savage man roaring in the wilderness because something in 
him demands release. After a long time, it seemed to her, 
they were in the Valley of Birds, and Winterbourne released 
her arm with a breath of content over his clever purpose. 

" Sit down on the bank, Catherine,'' he bade her. " Lie 
down. Lie on your back and look up. Don't you call this 
better than the ceiling of a room f " 



 





She did He down, but on her side, and put an arm over 
her eyes to shut out the hateful trees. 

" We must come by dawn some day," he said, disposing 
himself on the grass with satisfaction. " That 's when the 
birds get in their work. Little devils ! to say all they 've got 
to say while they 're alone ; they know we 're tied to our 
beds by sloth and civilization, because we use up every- 
thing we 've got in the course of twenty-four hours and can't 
renew ourselves in time to be up at the morning chorus. 
If we held service in the woods, we should know a few 
things we don't now." 

So he rolled on, forgetting Catherine, forgetting every pre- 
conceived determination, and conscious of what he some- 
times called, in moments of formulating, the Pan feeling, 
the sense that he was at one with his habitation, the earth. 
The earth currents ran without let through his veins, and he 
was not too old to feel his heart beat with a serene ecstasy. 
He murmured to himself now stanzas of poetry, the mean- 
ing of it, the English or the Greek of it not mattering, so 
that the sound seemed to his ears to fit the diapason of the 
time. Winterbourne felt blest, as he lay and looked up into 
his own trees. Here he was in a seclusion he could govern, 
as deep, so far as the ear and eye went, at this point, as if 
forests encompassed him. He had the robust health that 
lets a man still answer the call of beauty and of life, and dis- 
ordering emotions were far behind him. And then his eyes, 
following down the curious fretwork of a tree-bole to the 
needles below it, were caught by the blue and white figure 
stretched there in its unthinking grace, and he remembered 
the woman-thing he had brought out to lie in the lap of the 
woods and be mothered by the great kindness of the air. 

"Cat," he said softly, "you asleep?" 

" No," she answered, in as still a voice, not taking her 



 





arm down from her eyes. " John, how are we ever going 
to get home ? " 

To her, also, it was the primeval wilderness, but with a 
difference. He, in his musing, found himself shocked back 
to verities. Here he had been regarding the wood festival 
as a deep solemnity, and she was wondering how she could 
get home. But he bade himself remember that Bess said she 
was sick, and little as it looked like it, treat her as one in- 
competent. 

"You don't want to go back yet," said he. It was a 
kindly tone, almost the one he would have used to Tonty, 
only she never would have been so incomprehensible. " You 
want to get yourself soaked with the air and the sun." 

" The sun must be on me," said the muffled voice. " I 'm 
very warm." 

" Wait till that sunbeam creeps down the pine at your 
left. Look at it. Cat. See how it lights the bark." 

She put her arm closer over her eyes. 

" Do you think you could go home and get Bess ? " she 
asked him. 

Her voice had a sound of terror. Winterbourne thought 
he heard the prophecy of tears. But it at once became evi- 
dent to him that she was depending too entirely on Bess, 
and this was the matter. Take away her staff, and she would 
walk alone. 

"You don't want Bess," he said reprovingly, and yet in a 
kindly way, too, because he could not, in his heart, imagine 
how anybody who had known the ministrations of that calm 
strength could fail to call on her. 

" I do want her," Catherine cried. 

He scented hysteria the more nearly. 

" I 'm going to die, John. I 'm willing to die, but I hate 
the feeling of it. Call Bess, or you'll be sorry." 



 





The insistency of it did move him, as a woman, let her 
be demanding enough, is sure to move a man. He yields 
out of a large affectation of good-nature perhaps, out of 
chivalry, of boredom, he may tell himself; but the boy in 
him answers the mother in her and he gives way. 

"You're a silly. Cat," said he. Nevertheless he got on 
his feet. " I'll find her, but Bess'll tell you you 're a 
silly." 

At the edge of the clearing he stopped. She had called 
him back. She was sitting up now, her eyes distraught, the 
color in her face disordered. 

" Let me go, too," she cried. " I can't be left here, John. 
I 'm afraid, afraid ! " 

Winterbourne returned to her. This, in a measure, he 
could understand. He took her wrists, drew her up, and 
kept one hand within his arm. 

" Come on then," he said. " I know what you 're afraid 
of. I felt it myself once, by the sea, in a bright day when 
there was nobody in sight nor likely to be." 

But her teeth were chattering, and she shuddered while 
he led her out. It was nothing to her to know what she 
was afraid of, while the dreadful place loomed dark about 
her and the way through the lane stretched into imf)ossible 
miles. 

" It was Pan," Winterbourne's cheerful voice boomed 
against her ears, "the god Pan. He's in the stillness, you 
know. He makes himself manifest because we omit his wor- 
ship. But the fear's all he expects of us. That's recognition. 
That 's all he wants, old Pan." 

But naught heard Catherine save that words were beating 
at her ears, and she felt her feet drag heavily. Midway in 
the lane she stopped, and found a little voice. 

" It's over, John. I 'm dying." 



 





Wintcrbourne, recalled from Pan, got an arm about her, 
and looked down into her face. And then her knees really 
did give way, and the weight of her on his arm was the only 
sign of her being a creature still in this world. He looked 
at her distraught, but for a second only. The spring — he 
thought of that — was behind them. For an instant he con- 
sidered leaving her there by the pathside, and running home 
for Bess ; but if she was ever to wake she might wake 
frightened and that would be infernal. Pan might get her, 
after all. So he lifted her to his heart, and carrying her as 
he might have carried Tonty, for she was very light and he 
was strong, he strode homeward as fast as he could go, and 
once he put his cheek down to hers and then kissed the 
tangle of her hair. It was a pity Catherine could not have 
had the kiss in the days when kisses freely given would 
have beatified her; but perhaps then she would not have 
prized this kind at all, for it was pure, warm pity of some- 
thing he had hurt. And when he came out into the carrot- 
patch, there was Bess, as if their need had summoned her, 
standing like a sea-woman perhaps watching for her hus- 
band's boat, hand over her eyes in the attitude of those who 
look and wait. 

Winterbourne thought he had never been so glad to see 
any human creature. He felt like throwing Catherine at her 
and himself also into her arms — those kind arms, in the 
illusion of his need, seemed big enough — and blubbering 
like Tony on her breast. But all he did do was to stride on, 
and say in a monotone when he reached her, — 

" I vc killed her, Bess, I 've killed her." 

Bess turned, and, he noted, stepping over carrot-plumes 
with precision, went on with him. She took up Catherine's 
lax hand and held the wrist a moment. 

" I 've killed her, Bess," he said again ; and she answered 



 





him quite seriously, as if she had to believe every word he 
said, — 

" No, no, you didn't mean to." 

And then Winterbourne despaired indeed, and knew Bess 
also judged that Catherine was dead. He carried her into the 
sitting-room, as still now as it had been with its morning 
peace upon it, and laid her on the old hard sofa. Bess mean- 
time flew for brandy, for several things, he thought, for she 
came back with her hands full ; but before the brandy had 
fairly touched her lips, Catherine's eyes opened, and Winter- 
bourne, looking down upon her, gulped and said, " My 
God ! " He wanted to say it a great many times, knowing it 
would be a relief to him, but Bess gave him a quick frown 
and shook her head. He knew he must be derelict indeed 
for Bess to frown at him, and took it meekly. Catherine had 
things administered to her, and resumed her aspect of a hu- 
man creature with blood in her, and then what did she do 
but turn from Bess whom she had been crying out for, who 
was her rescuer, Winterbourne would fervently have sworn, 
her earthly hope and prop, to him who had dragged her from 
her bed and taken her out into the tree-solitudes to hear dis- 
sertations on Pan. She smiled even, and when she spoke 
there was a little undertone of pleasure in her voice. 

" Didn't we have a nice time, John ?" 

Winterbourne could only stare at her. Then he grinned 
a little. Catherine was game, he thought. 

" You help her upstairs," Bess commanded, with her air of 
giving not much attention to the present outward state of 
things, having so much to think about. 

So Winterbourne put his arms about his wife and lifted 
her again, though Catherine had been willing to take less of 
him, and carried her up in silence to her bed. 

When Bess came down, her kingdom being once more in 



 





security, he was waiting for her in the hall. His hand was 
closed upon an idle pipe. Not even that solace would he 
allow himself until he knew where he stood as criminal or 
sound citizen. 

" Going to hit me, Bess?" he inquired. "Going to turn 
your old father out of doors ? " 

But she had no questions to ask. There was too much to 
do in the world, and she had got out of the habit of curios- 
ity, save as it furthered deeds. 

" I guess she'll go right off to sleep," she said, " after she's 
had her milk and egg." 

He followed her to the kitchen. 

" What was it, Bess?" he insisted. 

" Why, she fainted away," said Bess, as if faints even were 
all in the day's work. " Here, you measure me a pint of 
milk while I beat these eggs. It 's time for Mrs. Ramsay's 
too." 

Hercules did it with precision, being used to chemistry in 
his youth. 

" Is her heart wrong ? " he suggested. " Don't you think 
she 'd better see a doctor ? " 

" She 's just give out, that 's all," said Bess, with one of her 
returns to the vernacular. " She's got no strength. That 's 
the way they are." 

" They ! " Who were they ? He pondered on it weakly 
and dared not ask. Had Catherine entered some classified 
estate never more to emerge to the vaguer limits of the mass ? 
But he had to inquire finally, or perish with the wonder 
of it. 

" Who 's they, Bess ? " he insisted, following her like a 
boy, tagging her while she went from kitchen to the stairs 
again with her two foaming beakers deftly carried. She was 
treating him like a boy, too. 



 





" Why, folks when they 've used themselves up,' she 
vouchsafed him, almost impatiently it seemed, because he 
didn't know. " They get just this way. Mrs. Ramsay's done 
it one way ; she has another. Men-folks do it, too. Some- 
times they drop dead when they 're making a speech. That 's 
because they 've wore their hearts out. Sometimes they get 
just like this." 

She was halfway up the stairs now, and he stood finger- 
ing the newel-post in a maze. 

" Then it 's getting worn out ? " he said. " Bess, hold on 
a minute. If it's getting worn out, how about you? I don't 
suppose the rig you 're running here, being nigger dog to 
everybody, — I don't suppose you think that 's going to wear 
you out, do you ? " 

She looked gravely down at him and made the answer he 
least expected. 

" It might, I s'pose, but I don't mean to let it." 

She went on, leaving him confounded. He had looked for 
some gay disclaimer, some bravado of youth flaunting its 
own strength, but the brief homely words opened his mind 
suddenly to the idea that she was fighting a fight and knew 
it. She was not only serving other people, but she had the 
masterly sense to see that she, too, must be saved. 

" By Jupiter ! " Winterbourne swore. He dared not call, 
as he so often did in mere warm blood, on the Most High 
God of all, because it seemed, in a way, as if he dared not, 
as if he himself had somehow offended by being out of the 
fight, and if he challenged the God of all, he might hear 
answers. 



 



XXV 

CELIA had to meet Lovell at last and hearing him 
in the sitting-room, asking Bess for her, she went 
straight about it, taking a hat in her hand : for though 
she walked bareheaded always, it seemed wise to indicate 
that she was on her way out of doors. In the hall she met 
Bess, who had not lingered with him, and flashed a glance 
at her. No, he had not told. Bess wore her air of serene pre- 
occupation, not as one who has learned that an unexpected 
brother has stormed her threshold. And then Celia, with the 
frankest air of morning welcome, unillusioned by the memory 
even of kisses in the moonlight, went in to meet him. He was 
changed. The first glance at him as she advanced, hand pret- 
tily out, told her that. As that other moment had shocked 
and terrified her, it had transfigured him with hope and con- 
fidence. He looked like a splendid young man of another 
type than Dwight Hunter, but as fortunate in strength and 
prospective mastery. She felt a thrill at this, which might 
have been a little personal pride in him, but was more than 
half gratified vanity that her momentary conqueror was of 
an admirable mould. Lovell himself, if he had had time in 
these fleeting moments of the best days of his life, to look 
into a mirror and interrogate himself, would have wondered 
at the change in him. The old wary look lest the undesired 
should speak to him, the introspective beginning of bent 
shoulders, had given place to the tense muscles and high pose 
of the man set on victory. His love for Celia was so infinitely 
more than a fancy or a passion for a girl. She had called 
him out of that seclusion where the soul is practically done 



 





for, because it has taught itself to desire nothing. Now he 
aspired to everything. If he had had any design of a tenderer 
greeting than this hand-clasp in the morning light, he could 
not, in the face of her frank attitude, bring it about. 

" I 'm going to walk," she said. "You want to come?" 

" I came to get you," said Lovell, at once delighted at their 
according views. " I want you to come over to the house a 
minute." 

" The house ? What house ? " The candid glance inquired 
as her tone did. 

" Mine." 

"Why, I can't, Mr. Lovell." 

The set title he did not like. He frowned at it, but dis- 
missed it as matter that might be settled at some tenderer 
time. 

"Why can't you?" 

"There 's nobody to go with me. Mamma is ill in bed. It 
would be queer." 

That he considered seriously. 

" Nothing 's queer in Clyde," he ventured. " Except me. 
I 'm tabulated queer, but I 'm not going to be any more." 

"Oh, do be queer," said Celia brightly. "You mustn't 
change, or I shan't know you." 

"I shan't change about — other things." 

This was a brief indication that love-making was not to be 
superseded by the overhauling of houses. " But I want you. 
You 've got to come. Hopkins is putting off his vacation for 
me, and we must know what to do." 

"Who's Hopkins?" Yet she knew who Hopkins was. 

" The builder. How can he tell whether the missus'll 
like her house unless she gives the orders ? " 

That note in his voice almost angered her. She did not 
love him apparently, her appraising sense of the moment 



 





told her. She was sorry. It would have been so easy, living 
in the big house with him, to take Bess to her and establish 
both their lives. 

" Come!" she said, for it was evident he had meant in 
another instant to find her hand. " Come on out doors." 

She spoke lightly, as she thought Tonty, just arrived to 
make her mother a proper womanly call, might have spoken, 
and she went immediately out of the room, he following. 
Then he had his inspiration. 

" Why," said he, " there 's Winterbourne ! '' 

"Where?" 

She was going down the path, her pretty dress enwrapping 
her, he felt, with similes surging about him, like the calyx 
of a rose. She hummed a little under her breath, and he 
knew that he was following her into the land of faerie. But 
he would much rather stay and get the house ready for their 
mating. 

" If you want a chaperon, why not Winterbourne ? " he 
pressed it. " He 's always wandering up and down the earth. 
He 's got nothing to do. In a minute we shall see him sit- 
ting under a tree somewhere, and we'll call upon him to 
come and hear us talk ceilings and gutter-pipes." 

Celia laughed and sang a little clearly. Winterbourne was 
not going to be told secrets about engagements. But there 
was no danger. She knew where he was ; he had gone down 
to the Ramsays' to lull three little Ramsays into seemliness 
with old wives' tales while Tonty made her call. 

"I can talk ceilings just as well outdoors," said she. 
" Come, let 's go into the Valley of Birds. Mr. Winter- 
bourne 's down there lying on his back, smoking. Come." 

Lovell fell into step with her and they went down the 
lane, Celia singing in her light true voice, with a r'egret she 
could never help behind it, that hers was not the marketable 



 





one. Then we should see. Out in the open day, daring came 
on her, and a sense of mastery over such a helpless thing as 
a man in love. Why had she dreaded to see him? He 
couldn't kiss her, because there would never be any mo- 
ment when she was unprepared. He couldn't marry her 
against her will. He was a well-made creature with a domi- 
nating look now there was something he wanted to domi- 
nate ; but she, too, was good-looking, and she could take a 
hand at reigning. And the woman's desire to play with what 
it has caught possessed her, and she liked it. She had been 
all her later life the plaything of another's will. Catherine had 
pursued her into the desire to be something of mark, and 
now suddenly, through nature and not herself, because a man 
was a man and she had inexplicably bidden him remember 
that she was a woman, she stood queen in her own right. 
At the wood-opening she stopped and turned her candid 
eyes on him. 

" I don't believe — " She hesitated here, and he helped her 
tenderly. 

"What don't you believe, dearest?" 

" I don't believe I want Mr. Winterbourne told why you 
arc taking me to see the house. I don't want anybody told." 

That seemed fitting in her, a most maidenly deliciousness. 
He was a poet, and he thought he saw with her the lovely 
vague outlines of her dream. 

" Don't you, dearest ? " He bent toward her, better to note 
the flush in her cheek averted now while she broke a spray 
from the wilding hedge, and showed the more to him her 
sweet confusion, — for it was not a blossomy spray, but only 
a homely branch to give pretext to her eyes and fingers. " I 
want them to know. They'll have to know, you see. If 
we were back a century or two, I could carry you oflF to my 
stronghold, but not now." 



 





" I 'd like that better,' said Celia, and laughing, looked at 
him again. 

It was not a confused face she turned on him ; it was just 
Celiacs face, untouched by soft emotion. But he was in his 
dream, and she looked to him any way and of any hue the 
dream required. 

"I should like it better, too," he said; and her heart 
leaped in a kind of resentment at his voice and the messages 
it was willing she should hear. " Then it could be now. It 
could be to-day." 

Celia did not know she had so many fierce passions in her, 
and she walked quickly on as if, though they were within, 
they were also a mob that could overtake her. She had had 
her discontents, a plenty, but this virginal revolt against a 
man appealing always, some secret voice in him to a hidden 
voice in her, and getting an answer even, if only of anger 
and despite, this was new to her. She hurried their pace into 
the Valley of Birds, and sat down by the tree-bole where 
Winterbourne had bidden Catherine, that other day, see the 
play of sunshine on the bark. 

" He isn't here," she said. " Mr. Winterbourne isn't 
here." 

Lovell, too, threw himself down and looked at her, tumul- 
tuous feeling in his eyes. 

" I 'm glad," he said. " Good man, not to be here ! " 

His spirit seemed to be getting the better of her, and she 
found herself wondering whether it would dash her self-con- 
trol, make her betray herself and show how much she hated 
him. 

" Do you come here often ? " she asked crudely. 

He laughed a little. 

" I used to come a lot. That 's when I wrote poetry. I 
thought it had got to be written out-of-doors. Jackass ! " 



 





He was smiling with an idle patronage for the young poet 
who had, after all his shots at greatness, yet managed this 
last crowning feat of man : persuaded a wonderful girl to love 
him. His momentaryretrospect released her. For an instant 
she did not feel the summons of that inner self of his laying 
fine wires to her door. She could afford to play a little in 
her turn. 

" I want to know your poetry," she offered meltingly. 

The poet, surprised, came broad awake, accusingly. 

" You said you 'd read it." 

She caught herself up. Her laugh came on the dot. 

" So you did remember," she challenged him. 

" Getting a rise out of me? Is that it? " 

" I meant to find out whether you did remember." 

" Well, I did. I haven't thought of much else. It wasn't 
the verses. It was your reading 'em. It seemed so — " 

He could not think logically of any particular thing it 
seemed to indicate, except that it was destined and adorable. 

" But I do want to know them better," she insisted. " I 
want to hear you read them. I wish we had the book. We 
could read them here." 

j Lovell, shaking his head in decisive turns from side to 
side, looked at her in something more nearly approaching 
a query of her real complexion of mind than he had ever 
shown. It seemed to ask whether indeed she could be cut 
out of the pattern, or anything approaching it, of the ladies 
who bade him to teas with a horrible prospective tendency 
to yearn over his verse. 

" Not on your life," said he. " You don't catch this minor 
poet reading his own stuff." 

" But why ? " Celia persisted, with a delicate upward lilt 
of tone. " You know so well how it ought to be read. You 
could interpret it." 



 





That had a familiar ring. Was this the way the Ramsay 
faction used to talk when they besought him to share his 
gifts with them ? He felt a wave of the old nervous terror. 

" Don't, dearest. You'll make me begin to be deaf." 

" You can't be deaf with me. You promised." 

" I ought to have made you promise, same time, not to 
flatter me. I like other kinds, dearest. Tell me you like 
me awfully. That 's flattering enough. Don't tell me I 'm 
a poet. I 'm just what Tony 's bending pins to catch. I 'm 
a minny, not a whale. Not a trout even. Just a minny." 

" Do you think," said Celia, " that Tim Ramsay isn't 
very well understood ? " 

"Tim?" He showed his frank surprise. "Why, there's 
nothing about Tim to understand." 

" You 'd say he 's all on the surface ? " 

" What there is of him. He 's got a nice complexion. 
That 's on the surface." 

He was looking idly before him now, following the waver- 
ing course of a white butterfly that had somehow strayed into 
the cool of the woods, and went wandering about, drawing 
indecisive curves upon the air, like a weak hand striving to 
form linesj and hesitating. 

" Don't you think he might have good ideas," she ven- 
tured, seeing, in this mood of his, how far away they were 
from pan-pipes and patents, " if somebody would only help 
him develop them ? " 

"Ideas about what? See that butterfly. He's lost in the 
infinite." 

She had time to stop and widen her eyes over the but- 
terfly. 

" If some one would help him out," she ventured. 

Lovell didn't understand. He began to give a lazy, 
disquisition on Tim, who had never seemed to him any- 



 





thing but an unmarketable commodity whom Mrs. Ram- 
say had, in the period of her discontents and unformulated 
theories, summoned into the world. Perhaps he was like 
Ramsay, save that he couldn't figure. Perhaps he was the 
memory of Mrs. Ramsay's girlhood, before she became a 
caryatid with a world or the temple of the millennium on 
her head and hands. But he did not know how to elucidate 
Tim's prenatal tendencies or his present fiiculties to an 
idealizing young woman who was caught by his complexion. 

" Oh, Tim 's all right," he said absently. " Do you like 
white paint all over the house ? " 

She smiled and shook her head at the paint. 

"You see he wants to make a business venture," she 
pursued, though doubtfully. " And I feel as if he ought to 
have the advice of an older man." 

Lovell threw her a quick look. 

"Tim Ramsay been talking to you?" he inquired. 

She retreated. She thought there was displeasure in his 
tone. 

" Oh, no, not talking. Only he seems pathetic somehow. 
They don't teach him to do anything — " 

" He wouldn't do it if they did. Tim 's lazy. He 's got 
no stamina. That 's why he 's lazy. The boy 's no better 
than a weakling girl." 

" There, you see ! you own he 's to be pitied." 

"You're divine," said Lovell, falling into his coma of 
blind love, " you women. You idealize and pity and build 
up pedestals, and we 're no such matter as you think us." 
His mind had gone suddenly back to his mother and sister 
and their adoration of him, and with this passion for a girl 
opening his eyes to the way women's fancies ought to be cher- 
ished, he wondered if he had been kind to them. " But don't 
waste anything on Tim. He never'll grow up. You'll see." 



 





" I 'd waste something on him,' she dared. " If I had it
I 'd waste — money." 

The word was out, the word she had at the back of her 
brain, but she said it like a pretty jest. Again he threw her 
that sharp, sudden look, and it stayed on her. 

" What 's Tim been saying to you ? " he asked. 

" Nothing, nothing," she protested. " Only I somehow 
got the idea he was clever. I thought he might invent 
something, had invented it, and I thought with his father 
always in the city and his mother sick — why, it seemed a 
shame no one should help him." 

" He brought something of the sort to me a while ago," 
Lovell said absently. " No, I shouldn't give Tim money." 

She rose to her feet. 

" Come, then," she wanted to say, " the talk is over. This 
was what we were to consider, and since it 's ended and you 
won't, there 's nothing else." 

He, too, rose, and stood staring at her, awed by the 
strained pallor of her face. He had never seen her look 
like that. It was as if the white butterfly, strayed into the 
large darkness of the woods, had suddenly become the soul 
of which it was the symbol, and wanly faced him. Celia's 
eyes filled with tears. She looked about her at the tree- 
trunks and the light sifting down beyond them. It was 
all beauty, that impalpable veil upon the form of things to 
bid the soul worship and the eye rejoice in the prophecy 
of the ineffable. That it was beautiful she saw, but she 
could not beckon it to her heart with that glad rush of 
music to the ear. She had muffled herself so that the call 
of things failed to reach her. She had spun about herself a 
web. What was it? She thought of Bess with a little 
breath of relief, a grasping for her as if that might keep her 
sane.' If Bess were here, she would see the beauty. She 



 





might be too tired, she might have to shut her lovely eye- 
lids down and just lie and listen to the needles murmuring ; 
but she and the spot would be akin. Celia did not even 
know whether Bess had ever been here. She felt indignant 
pity for her, tied down to common tasks, and it seemed as 
if she must be at home that minute, kissing her and telling 
her how wroth she was. But it did not come to her, since 
Bess had been trained to do all these hard, hateful things 
and she had not, that she could make her less tired. 

All this time, a moment only perhaps, but long to both 
of them, Lovell stood watching the tragic misery of her 
look, waiting, in an extremity of sympathy, for it to clear. 
She turned to him slowly. The guarded sweetness was off 
her face. She seemed to be about to appeal to him, to beg 
him to help her brush away the web; but the color ran 
into her cheeks again, and she laughed hardily. 

"Come," she said, "let's go home." 

They went, silently. Once in the lane he tried to take 
her hand ; but she seemed remote, and a sad strangeness 
assailed him. 

"What is it?" he asked at the door. "What was it, 
Celia?" 

Now she could laugh again. 

"What was it?" she asked, in her high, clear voice. 
"Why, nothing!" 



 



XXVI 

WINTERBOURNE was at the Ramsays' while 
Tonty made her dutiful call. He had Teeny on 
one knee and Tiny on the other, and Tony sat 
before him, legs apart in painful travesty of man's majesty, 
whittling, but not omitting to keep a sharp ear out for the 
story. 

"Once upon a time," said Winterbourne, musing and 
telling the story to himself, as he almost always did when 
Tonty was not there, for then he could tell it to her, " once 
upon a time there was a little boy." 

Tony gave a nod of perfect satisfaction. The story, then, 
was for him. 

" Everybody thought he was a little boy, but he was n't. 
He was a fool." 

Tony, disgusted, withdrew from participation. But then 
he remembered there were kings' fools, and they always 
said the best things and came out ahead. So he took heart. 

" Was it a king's fool ? " he asked hopefully. 

"Maybe," said Winterbourne. "We'll see before we 
get through. Well, one day when he was quite a young 
fool, he found he had some money in his pocket." 

"Gold?" 

"Yes, gold in a silk purse. He hadn't really known he 
had it, but as soon as he thought about it a minute, he re- 
membered that every little boy and every fool has some to 
buy things with. Only he must be sure he buys the thing 
he wants most, for if he docs n't, he'll be sorry all his life." 

Tony whittled no more, but, knife on knee, sat staring 



 





up at him. There was poignant anxiety in the gaze — hope, 
too. Had he also a silk purse since it was said that all boys 
had them? Winterbourne read the query. 

" No, Tony," said he, " you won't find the purse for a 
number of years yet. But you'll find it in time, and then 
you must be sure to buy the right things with it." 

" Did this fellow ? " Tony asked, abandoning hope for 
himself. He was used to these postponings of valuable ex- 
perience to some future which was, apparently, to be his at a 
shadowy time. It seemed to him a part of the disgusting way 
things were arranged. You had to acquiesce in them for a while 
because grown-ups had a way of knowing how to keep them 
out of your reach ; but when he saw Dwight Hunter driving 
a pair of horses, or Winterbourne smoking a pipe of heavenly 
dusk, he knew this would not be so always. 

" Well, this fool looked round, as soon as he found he had 
the silk purse, and he saw a pretty child — a little girl she 
was — " 

" One of us ? " Tony inquired. 

" No, not one of you. But he liked her, and he said to the 
big Market-Man, ' How much ? ' " 

"Where's the Market-Man?" Tony inquired. 

He would never have been allowed to interrupt so fre- 
quently if Tonty had been there, and this he knew and it 
gave the moment piquancy. 

" He is said to live up in the sky," said Winterbourne. 
" But besides that He lives on the earth and in the sea." 

"Is He a whale?" 

" No, He 's bigger than a whale." 

"Then He couldn't live in the world without our seeing 
of Him." 

" We do see Him sometimes. We could oftener, if we 
didn't think about anything else. Well, the fool asked 



 





the big Market-Man how much, and He said, 'All you've 
got'" 

" Did Helook in the silk purse? " asked Tony. "Or how 'd 
He know how much he had got?" 

" No, He didn't look in the silk purse, but He knew 
what the price was, because it's always that. If a fool wants 
to buy a little girl, he must always pay all he 's got. He can't 
have any tops, or any engines, or any bow 'n' arrers. One 
reason is, little girls are so hungry. They eat a lot." 

" Tonty don't." Tony accorded this in rebuttal. 

"No, but Tonty hasn't been bought yet. They're not 
half so hungry till they're bought. Anyhow, if they are, they 
don't say anything about it. But there's lots of things they 
want to eat, then, pretty things, all of them. They want to 
eat rose-leaves and violet-leaves and cream and honey and 
cinnamon and nutmeg and clove and mace." 

"All together?" 

"Yes, all together and separate. And they want everything
