the end of next month. But we start to-morrow for 
Switzerland. Mrs. Pocock feels the want of scenery. She 
hasn't had much yet." 

He was brave in his way too, keeping nothing back, 





confessing to all there was, and only leaving Strether to 
make certain connections. " Is what Mrs. Newsomc has 
cabled her daughter an injunction to 'quit'?" 

The grand manner indeed, at this, just raised its head 
a little. " I know nothing about Mrs. Newsome's cables." 

Their eyes met on it with some intensity — during the 
few seconds of which something happened quite out of 
proportion to the time. It happened that Strether, looking 
thus at his friend, didn't take his answer for truth — and 
that something more again occurred in consequence of that. 
Yes — Waymarsh just did know about Mrs. Newsome's 
cables : to what other end than that had they dined to- 
gether at Bignon's? Strether almost felt for the instant 
that it was to Mrs. Newsome herself the dinner had been 
given ; and, for that matter, quite felt how she must have 
known about it and, as he might think, protected and 
consecrated it. He had a quick, blurred view of daily 
cables, questions, answers, signals ; clear enough was his 
vision of the expense that, when so exalted, the lady at 
home was prepared to incur. Vivid not less was his 
memory of what, during his long observation of her, some 
of her exaltations had cost her. Distinctly, she was exalted 
now, and Waymarsh, who imagined himself standing there 
on his own feet, was truly but suspended in an air of her 
making. The whole reference of his errand seemed to 
mark her for Strether as by this time consentingly familiar 
to him, and nothing yet had so despoiled her of a special 
shade of consideration. " You don't know," he asked, 
"whether Sarah has been directed from home to try me 
on the matter of my also going to Switzerland ?" 

" I know," said Waymarsh as manfully as possible, 
"nothing whatever about her private affairs, though I 
believe her to be acting in conformity with things that 
have my highest respect" It was as manful as possible, 
but it was still the same manner — as it had to be to 
convey so sorry a statement. He knew everything, Strether 
more and more felt, that he thus disclaimed, and his little 
fjunishment was just in this doom to a second fib. What 
falser position — given the man — could the most vindictive 
mind impose? He ended by squeezing through a passage 
I in which, three months before, he would certainly have 





stuck fast. " Mrs. Pocock will probably be ready herself 
to answer any inquiry you may put to her. But," he 
continued, "  2 / !" He faltered on it. 

" But what ? Don't put her too many ? " 

Waymarsh looked large, but the harm was done ; he 
couldn't, do what he would, help looking rosy. " Don't 
do anything you'll be sorry for." 

It was an attenuation, Strether guessed, of something 
else that had been on his lips ; it was a sudden drop to 
directness, and was thereby the voice of sincerity. He 
had fallen to the supplicating note, and that immediately, 
for our friend, made a difference and reinstated him. They 
were in communication as they had been, that first morn- 
ing, in Sarah's salon and in her presence and Mme. 
de Vionnet's ; and the same recognition of a great good- 
will was again, after all, possible. Only the amount of 
response Waymarsh had then taken for granted was 
doubled, decupled now. This came out when he presently 
said, " Of course I needn't assure you / hope you'll come 
with us." Then it was that his implications and expecta- 
tions loomed up for Strether as almost pathetically gross. 

The latter patted his shoulder while he thanked him, 
giving the go-by to the question of joining the Pococks ; 
he expressed the joy he felt at seeing him go forth again 
so brave and free, and he in fact almost took leave of him 
on the spot. " I shall see you again of course before you 
go ; but Pm meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging 
so conveniently for what you've told me. I shall walk up 
and down in the court there — dear little old court which 
we've each bepaced so, this last couple of months, to the 
tune of our flights and our drops, our hesitations and our 
plunges ; I shall hang about there, all impatience and ex- 
citement, please let Sarah know, till she graciously presents 
herself. Leave me with her without fear," he laughed ; 
" I assure you I shan't hurt her. I don't think either, 
that she'll hurt me ; Pm in a situation in which damage 
was some time ago discounted. Besides, that isn't what 
worries you — but don't, don't explain ! We're all right 
as we are, which was the degree of success our adventure 
was pledged to for each of us. We weren't, it seemed, all 
right as we were before ; and we've got over the ground, 





all things considered, quickly. I hope you'll have a lovely 
time in the Alps." 

Waymarsh fairly looked up at him as from the foot of 
them. " I don't know as I ought really to go." 

It was the conscience of Milrose in the very voice of 
Milrose, but, oh, it was feeble and flat ! Strether suddenly 
felt quite ashamed for him, and breathed a greater bold- 
ness. " Let yourself, on the contrary, go — in all agreeable 
directions. These are precious hours — at our age they 
mayn't recur. Don't have it to say to yourself at Milrose, 
next winter, that you hadn't courage for them." And then 
as his comrade queerly stared : " Live up to Mrs. Pocock." 

" Live up to her?" 

 ' You're a great help to her." 

Waymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable 
things that were certainly true and that it was yet ironical 
to say. " It's more then than you are." 

" That's exactly your own chance and advantage. 
Besides," said Strether, " I do in my way contribute. I 
know what I'm about." 

Waymarsh had kept on his great panama, and, as he 
now stood nearer the door, his last look, beneath the shade 
of it, had turned again to darkness and warning. " So do 
I ! See here, Strether." 

" I know what you're going to say. Quit it all ! " 

" Quit it all ! " But it lacked its old Intensity ; nothing 
of it remained ; it went out of the room with him. 



XXVII 

Almost the first thing, strangely enough, that, about an 
hour later, Strether found himself doing in Sarah's presence 
was to remark articulately on this failure, in their friend, of 
what had been superficially his great distinction. It was 
as if — he alluded of course to the grand manner — the dear 
man had sacrificed it to some other advantage; which would 
be of course only for himself to measure. It might be 
simply that he was physically so much more sound than on 
his first coming out. This was all so prosaic, so compara- 
tively cheerful and vulgar. And fortunately, if one came 
to that, his improvement in health was really itself grander 
than any manner it could be conceived as having cost him. 
" You yourself alone, dear Sarah " — Strether took the 
plunge — " have done him, it strikes me, in these three 
weeks, as much good as all the rest of his time together." 
It was a plunge because somehow the range of reference 
was, in the conditions, funny, and made funnier still by 
Sarah's attitude, by the turn the occasion had, with her 
appearance, so sensibly taken. Her appearance was really 
indeed funnier than anything else — the spirit in which he 
felt her to be there as soon as she zvas there, the shade of 
obscurity that cleared up for him as soon as he was seated 
with her in the small salon de lecture that had, for the most 
part, in all the weeks, witnessed the wane of his early 
vivacity of discussion with Waymarsh. It was an immense 
thing, quite a tremendous thing, for her to have come: this 
truth opened out to him in spite of his having already 
arrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it. He had 
done exactly what he had given Va)'marsh his word for 
— had walked and rewalked the court while he awaited 
her advent ; acquiring in this exercise an amount of light 
that affected him at the time as flooding the scene. She 
had decided upon the step in order to give him the benefit 







of a doubt, in order to be able to say to her mother that she 
had, even to abjectness, smoothed the way for him. The 
doubt had been as to whether he mightn't take her as not 
having smoothed it — and the admonition had possibly 
come from Waymarsh's more detached spirit. Waymarsh 
had at any rate, certainly, thrown his weight into the scale 
— he had pointed to the importance of depriving their friend 
of a grievance. She had done justice to the plea, and it 
was to set herself right with a high ideal that she actually 
sat there in her state. Her calculation was sharp in the 
immobility with which she held her tall parasol-stick 
upright and at arm's length, quite as if she had struck the 
place to plant her flag; in the separate precautions she took 
not to show as nervous ; in the aggressive repose in which 
she did quite nothing but wait for him. Doubt ceased to 
be possible from the moment he had taken in that she had 
arrived with no proposal whatever ; that her concern was 
simply to show what she had come to receive. She had 
come to receive his submission, and Waymarsh was to have 
made it plain to him that she would expect nothing less. 
He saw fifty things, her host, at this convenient stage ; but 
one of those he most saw was that their anxious friend had 
not quite had the hand required of him. Waymarsh //rtrt'.how- 
ever, uttered the request that she might find him mild, and 
while hanging about the court before her arrival Strether 
had turned over with zeal the different ways in which he 
could be so. The difficulty was that if he was mild he 
wasn't, for her purpose, conscious. If she wished him con- 
scious — as everything about her cried aloud that she did — 
she must accordingly be at costs to make him so. Conscious 
he waSy for himself — but only of too many things. So she 
must choose the one she required. 

Practically, however, it at last got itself named, and when 
once that had happened they were quite at the centre of 
their situation. One thing had really done as well as 
another ; when Strether had spoken of Waymarsh's leaving 
him, and that had necessarily brought on a reference to 
Mrs. Pocock's similar intention, the jump was but short to 
supreme lucidity. Light became indeed after that so 
intense that Strether would doubtless have but half made 
out, in the prodigious glare, by which of the two the issue 





had been in fact precipitated. It was, in their contracted 
quarters, as much there between them as if it had been 
something suddenly spilled, with a crash and a splash, on 
the floor. The form of his submission was to be an 
engagement to acquit himself within the twenty-four hours. 
" He'll go in a moment if you give him the word — he 
assures me on his honour he'll do that": this came in its 
order, out of its order, in respect to Chad, after the crash 
had occurred. It came repeatedly during the time taken 
by Strether to feel that he was even more fixed in his 
rigour than he had supposed — the time he was not above 
adding to a little by telling her that such a way of putting 
it, on her brother's part, left him sufficiently surprised. She 
wasn't at all funny at last — she was really fine ; and he felt 
easily where she was strong — strong for herself. It had not 
yet so come home to him that she was nobly and appointedly 
officious. She was acting in an interest grander and clearer 
than that of her poor little personal, poor little Parisian 
equilibrium, and all his consciousness of her mother's moral 
pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining force. She 
would be held up ; she would be strengthened ; he needn't 
in the least be uneasy for her. What would, once more, 
have been distinct to him had he tried to make it so, was 
that, as Mrs. Newsome was essentially all moral pressure, the 
presence of this element was almost identical with her own 
presence. It wasn't perhaps that he felt he was dealing 
with her straight, but it was certainly as if she had been 
straight with him. She was reaching him, somehow, by 
the lengthened arm of the spirit, and he was having to that 
extent to take her into account. But he was not reaching 
her in turn, not making her to take //////; he was only 
reaching Sarah, who appeared to take so little of him. 
" Something has clearly passed between you and Chad," 
he presently said, " that I think I ought to know some- 
thing more about. Does he put it all," he smiled, "on 
me?" 

" Did you come to Paris," she asked, " to put it all on 
him?'' 

But he replied to this no further than, after an instant, 
by saying, " Oh, it's all right. Chad, I mean, is all right 
in having said to you — well anything he may have said. 




I'll take it all — what he does put on me. Only I must see 
him before I see you again." 

She hesitated, but she brought it out. " Is it absolutely 
necessary you should see me again ? " 

"Certainly, if I'm to give you any definite word about 
anything." 

" Is it your idea then," she returned, " that I shall keep 
on meeting you only to be exposed to fresh humiliation ? " 

He fixed her a longer time. "Are your instructions 
from Mrs. Newsome that you shall, even at the worst, 
absolutely and irretrievably break with me?" 

"My instructions from Mrs. Newsome are, if you please, 
my affair. You know perfectly what your own were, and 
you can judge for yourself of what it can do for you to 
have made what you have of them. You can perfectly 
see, at any rate, I'll go so far as to say, that if I wish not 
to expose myself, I must wish still less to expose her'' 
She had already said more than she had quite expected ; 
but, though she had also pulled up, the colour in her face 
showed him he should, from one moment to the other, 
have it all. He now indeed felt the high importance of 
his having it. " What is your conduct," she broke out as if 
to explain — " what is your conduct but an outrage to 
women like us ? I mean your acting as if there can be a 
doubt — as between us and such another — of his duty? " 

He thought a moment. It was rather much to deal 
with at once ; not only the question itself, but the sore 
abysses it revealed. " Of course they're totally different 
kinds of duty." 

"And do you pretend that he has any at all — to such 
another?" 

"Do you mean to Mme. de Vionnet?" He uttered the 
name not to affront her, but yet again to gain time — time 
that he needed for taking in something still other and 
larger than her demand of a moment before. It was not 
at once that he could see all that was in her actual 
challenge; but when he did he found himself just checking 
a low, vague sound, a sound which was perhaps the nearest 
approach his vocal chords had ever known to a growl. 
Everything Mrs. Pocock had failed to give a sign of 
recognising in Chad as a particular part of a transforma- 





tion — everything that had lent intention to this particular 
failure affected him as gathered into a large, loose bundle 
and thrown, in her words, into his face. The missile made 
him to that extent catch his breath ; which, however, he 
presently recovered. " Why, when a woman is at once so 
charming and so beneficent " 

" You can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a 
blush, and can make them cross the ocean on purpose to 
feel the more, and take from you the straighter, how you 
do it?" 

Yes, she had taken him up as short and as sharply as 
that ; but he tried not to flounder in her grasp. " I don't 
think there's anything I've done in any such calculated 
way as you describe. Everything has come as a sort of 
indistinguishable part of everything else. Your coming 
out belonged closely to my having come before you, and 
my having come was a result of our general state of mind. 
Our general state of mind had proceeded, on its side, from 
our funny ignorance, our funny misconceptions and con- 
fusions — from which, since then, an inexorable tide of light   
seems to have floated us into our perhaps still funnier 
knowledge. Don't you like your brother as he is," he went 
on, "and haven't you given your mother an intelligible 
account of all that that comes to ? " 

It put to her also, doubtless, his own tone, too many 
things ; this at least would have been the case had not his 
final challenge directly helped her. Everything, at the 
stage they had reached, directly helped her, because every- ! 
thing betrayed in him such a basis of intention. He saw 
— the odd way things came out ! — that he would have been 
held less monstrous had he only been a little wilder, 
What exposed him was just his poor old trick of q uietj 
inwardness, what exposed him was his thinking ' s&cfr 
offence. He had not in the least, however, the desire to   
irritate that Sarah imputed to him, and he could only at  
last temporise, for the moment, with her indignant view.! 
She was altogether more irritated than he had expected,  
and he would probably understand this better when he" 
should learn what had occurred for her with Chad. Till  
then her view of his particular blackness, her clear sur-  
prise at his not clutching the pole she held out, must pass ' 




as extravagant. " I leave you to flatter yourself," she 
returned, " that what you speak of is what you've beauti- 
fully done. When a thing has been already described in 

such a lovely way ! " But she caught herself up, and 

her comment on his description rang out sufficiently loud. 
" Do you consider her even an apology for a decent 
woman ? " 

Ah, there it was at last ! She put the matter more 
crudely than, for his own mixed purposes, he had yet had 
to do ; but, essentially, it was all one matter. It was so 
much — so much ; and she treated it, poor lady, as so little. 
He grew conscious, as he was now apt to, of a strange 
smile, and the next moment he found himself talking like 
Miss Barrace. " She has struck me from the first as 
wonderful. I've been thinking too, moreover, that, after 
all, she would probably have represented even for yourself 
something rather new and rather good." 

He was to have given Mrs. Pocock with this, however, 
but her best opportunity for a sound of derision. " Rather 
new ? I hope so with all my heart ! " 

" I mean," he explained, " that she might have affected 
you by her exquisite amiability — a real revelation, it has 
seemed to myself; her high rarity, her distinction of every 
sort." 

He had been, with these words, consciously a little 
"precious"; but he had had to be — he couldn't give her 
the truth of the case without them ; and it seemed to him, 
moreover, now, that he didn't care. He had at all events 
not served his cause, for she sprang at its exposed side. 
" A ' revelation ' — to me: I've to come to such a woman 
for a revelation? You talk to me about 'distinction' — 
you, you who've had your privilege — when the most dis- 
tinguished woman we shall either of us have seen in this 
world sits there insulted, in her loneliness, by your in- 
credible comparison?" 

Strether forebore, with an effort, from straying ; but he 
looked all about him. " Does your mother herself make 
the point that she sits insulted?" 

Sarah's answer came so straight, so " pat," as might have 
been said, that he felt on the instant its origin. " She has 
confided to my judgment and my tenderness the expression 



of her personal sense of everything, and the assertion of 
her personal dignity." 

They were the very words of the lady of Woollett — he 
would have known them in a thousand; her parting charge 
to her child. Mrs. Pocock, accordingly, spoke to this 
extent by book, and the fact immensely moved him. " If 
she does really feel as you say, it's, of course, very, very 
dreadful. I've given sufficient proof, one would have 
thought," he added, " of my deep admiration for Mrs. 
Newsome." 

" And pray what proof would one have thought you'd 
call sufficient ? That of thinking this person here so far 
superior to her ? " 

He wondered again ; he waited. " Ah, dear Sarah, you 
must leave me this person here ! " 

In his desire to avoid all vulgar retorts, to show how, 
even perversely, he clung to his rag of reason, he had 
softly almost wailed this plea. Yet he knew it to be 
perhaps the most positive declaration he had ever made 
in his life, and his visitor's reception of it virtually gave it 
that importance. "That's exactly what I'm delighted to 
do. God knows we don't want her ! You take good 
care not to meet," she observed in a still higher key, " my 
question about their life. If you do consider it a thing one 
can even speak of, I congratulate you on your taste ! " 

The life she alluded to was, of course, Chad's and 
Mme. de Vionnet's, which she thus bracketed together 
in a way that made him wince a little, there being nothing 
for him but to take home her full intention. It was none 
the less his inconsequence that while he had himself been 
enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant woman's 
specific action, he just suffered from any characterisation 
of it by other lips. " I think tremendously well of her, 
at the same time that I seem to feel her ' life ' to be really 
none of my business. It's my business, that is, only so 
far as Chad's own life is affected by it ; and what has 
happened — don't you see? — is that Chad's has been 
affected so beautifully. The proof of the pudding's in the 
eating" — he tried, with no great success, to help it out 
with a touch of pleasantry, while she let him go on as if 
to sink and sink. He went on, however, well enough, as 





well as he could do without fresh counsel ; he indeed 
shouldn't stand quite firm, he felt, till he should have re- 
established his communications with Chad. Still, he could 
always speak for the woman he had so definitely promised 
to " save." This wasn't quite, for her, the air of salvation ; 
but as that chill fairly deepened, what did it become but 
a reminder that one might, at the worst, perish with her ? 
And it was simple enough — it was rudimentary ; not, not 
to give her away. " I find in her more merits than you 
would probably have patience with my counting over. 
And do you know," he inquired, " the effect you produce 
on me by alluding to her in such terms? It's as if you 
had some motive in not recognising all she has done for 
your brother, and so shut your eyes to each side of the 
matter, in order, whichever side comes up, to get rid of 
the other. I don't, you must allow me to say, see how 
you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side 
nearest you." 

" Near me — that sort of thing?" And Sarah gave a jerk 
back of her head that well might have placed a penalty on 
any active approach. 

It kept her friend himself at a distance, and he respected 
for a moment the interval. Then, with a last persuasive 
effort, he bridged it. " You don't, on your honour, appre- 
ciate Chad's fortunate development?" 

"Fortunate?" she echoed again. And indeed she was 
ready. " I call it hideous." 

Her departure had been for some minutes marked as 
imminent, and she was already at the door that stood 
open to the court, from the threshold of which she de- 
livered herself of this judgment. It rang out so loud as 
to produce for the time the hush of everything else. 
Strether quite, as an effect of it, breathed less bravely ; he 
could acknowledge it, but simply enough. " Oh, if you 
think that !" 

" Then all's at an end ? So much the better. I do think 
that ! " She passed out as she spoke and took her way 
straight across the court, beyond which, separated from 
them by the deep arch of the porte-cochere, the low 
victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was 
drawn up. She made for it with decision, and the manner 





of her break, the sharp shaft of her rejoinder, had an ti 
intensity by which Strether was at first kept in arrest.    
She had let fly at him as from a stretched cord, and it t 
took him a minute to recover from the sense of being   
pierced. It was not the penetration of surprise ; it was 
that, much more, of certainty ; his case being put for < 
him as he had as yet only put it to himself. She was I 
away, at any rate ; she had distanced him — with rather a . 
grand spring, an effect of pride and ease, after all ; she ! 
had got into her carriage before he could overtake her, 
and the vehicle was already in motion. He stopped half- 
way ; he stood there in the court, only seeing her go and 
noting that she gave him no other look. The way he had 
put it to himself was that all quite might be at an end. :; 
Each of her movements, in this resolute rupture, re-  
affirmed, reinforced that idea. Sarah passed out of sight ; 
in the sunny street, while, planted in the middle of his 
comparatively gray enclosure, he continued merely to look 
before him. It probably was all at an end. 



XXVIII 

He went late that evening to the Boulevard Malesherbes, 
laving his impression that it would be vain to go early, 
md having also, more than once in the course of the day, 
nade inquiries of the concierge. Chad had not come in 
md had left no intimation ; he had affairs, apparently, at 
his juncture — as it occurred to Strether he so well might 
lave — that kept him long abroad. Our friend asked once 
or him at the hotel in the Rue de Rivoli, but the only 
;atisfaction there was that everyone was out. It was with 
he idea that he would have to come home to sleep that 
Strether went up to his rooms, from which, however, he 
vas still absent, though, from the balcony, a few moments 
ater, his visitor heard eleven o'clock strike. Chad's ser- 
vant had by this time answered for his reappearance ; he 
'tad, the visitor learned, come quickly in to dress for dinner 
md vanish again. Strether spent an hour in waiting for 
lim — an hour full of strange suggestions, persuasions, 
ecognitions ; one of those that he was to recall, at the end 
)f his adventure, as the particular handful that most had 
:ounted. The mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair 
lad been placed at his disposal by Baptiste — subtlest of 
servants; the novel half uncut, the novel lemon-coloured' 
md tender, with the ivory knife athwart it like a dagger 
n a contadina's hair, had been pushed within the soft 
i rcle — a circle which, for some reason, affected Strether as 
f iofter still after the same Baptiste had remarked that, in 
Jie absence of a further need of anything by Monsieur, 
le would betake himself to bed. The night was hot and 
leavy, and the single lamp sufficient ; the great flare of 
-he lighted city, rising high, spending itself afar, played up 
rom the Boulevard and, through the vague vista of the 
juccessive rooms, brought objects into view and added to 
their dignity. Strether found himself in possession as he 


never yet had been ; he had been there alone, had turnedi 
over books and prints, had invoked, in Chad's absence, tho 
spirit of the place, but never at the witching hour, an(  
never with a relish quite so like a pang. 

He spent a long time on the balcony; he hung over it a  
he had seen little Bilham hang the day of his first api 
proach, as he had seen Mamie hang over her own the da; 
little Bilham himself might have seen her from below ; h
passed back into the rooms, the three that occupied th 
front and that communicated by wide doors ; and, whil 
he circulated and rested, tried to recover the impression 
that they had made on him three months before, to catch 
again the voice in which they had seemed then to speak to 
him. That voice, he had to note, failed audibly to sound 
which he took as the proof of all the change in himself 
He had heard, of old, only what he could then hear ; what 
he could do now was to think of three months ago as
point in the far past. All voices had grown thicker an  
meant more things ; they crowded on him as he m.ove ', 
about — it was the way they sounded together that wouldn 't 
let him be still. He felt, strangely, as sad as if he had   
come for some wrong, and yet as excited as if he had com  
for some freedom. But the freedom was what was mo5)  
in the place and the hour; it was the freedom that moj  
brought him round again to the youth of his own that h 
had long ago missed. He could have explained littlii 
enough to-day either why he had missed it or why, aftc jl 
years and years, he should care that he had ; the mai  i 
truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the las 'I 
that everything represented the substance of his loss, pus 
it within reach, within touch, made it, to a degree it ha i) 
never been, an affair of the senses. That was what ; 
became for him at this singular time, the youth he hai 
long ago missed — a queer, concrete presence, full of my5 1 
tery, yet full of reality, which he could handle, taste, smel 
the deep breathing of which he could positively heaj 
It was in the outside air as well as within ; it was in th . 
long watch from the balcony, in the summer night of th I 
wide, late life of Paris, the unceasing soft, quick rumblj 
below of the lighted carriages that, in the press, alway;' 
suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at Monte Carl 3 





pushing up to the tables. This image was before him 
when he at last became aware that Chad was behind. 

"She tells me you put it all on me" — he had arrived, 
after this, promptly enough at that information — which 
expressed the matter, however, quite as the young man 
appeared willing for the moment to leave it. Other things, 
with this advantage of their virtually having the night 
before them, came up for them, and had, as well, the odd 
effect of making the occasion, instead of hurried and 
feverish, one of the largest, loosest and easiest to which 
Strether's whole adventure was to have treated him. He 
had been pursuing Chad from an early hour and had over- 
taken him only now; but now the delay was repaired by 
their being so exceptionally confronted. They had fore- 
gathered enough, of course, in all the various times ; they 
had again and again, since that first night at the theatre, 
been face to face over their question ; but they had never 
been so alone together as they were actually alone — their 
talk had not yet been so supremely for themselves. And 
if many things, moreover, passed before them, none passed 
more distinctly for Strether than that striking truth about 

, Chad, of which he had been so often moved to take note : 
the truth that everything came happily back with him to 
his knowing how to live. It had been seated in his pleased 

I smile — a smile pleased exactly in the right degree — as his 
visitor turned round, on the balcony, to greet his advent ; 
his visitor in fact felt on the spot that there was nothing 
their meeting would so much do as bear witness to that 
facility. He surrendered himself, accordingly, to so ap- 
proved a gift ; for what was the meaning of the facility 
but that others did surrender themselves ? He didn't want, 

I luckily, to prevent Chad from living ; but he was quite 
aware that even if he had he would himself have thoroughly 
gone to pieces. It was in truth essentially by bringing 
down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the 
young man's own that he held together. And the great 
point, above all, the sign of how completely Chad possessed 
the knowledge in question, was that one thus became, not 
only with a proper cheerfulness, but with wild native 
impulses, the feeder of his stream. Their talk had accord- 
ingly not lasted three minutes without Strether's feeling 


basis enough for the excitement in which he had waited. , 

This overflow fairly deepened, wastefully abounded, as he   

observed the smallness of anything corresponding to it on 

the part of his friend. That was exactly this friend's happy 

case ; he " put out " his excitement, or whatever other   

emotion the matter involved, as he put out his washing ; 

than which no arrangement could make more for domestic ! 

order. It was quite for Strether himself, in short, to feel a 

personal analogy with the laundress bringing home the  

triumphs of the mangle. 

When he had reported on Sarah's visit, which he did very  

fully, Chad answered his question with perfect candour. ; 

" I positively referred her to you — told her she must I 

absolutely see you. This was last night, and it all took 

place in ten minutes. It was our first free talk — really the ; 

first time she had tackled me. She knew I also knew what ' 

her line had been with yourself ; knew, moreover, how little  

you had been doing to make anything difficult for her. So  i 

I spoke for you frankly — assured her you were all at her fj 

service. I assured her / was too," the young man con-  

tinued ; " and I pointed out how she could perfectly, at any  

time, have got at me. Her difficulty has been simply her il 
not finding the moment she fancied." 

" Her difficulty," Strether returned, " has been simply 

that she finds she's afraid of you. She's not afraid of vie, 

Sarah, one little scrap ; and it was just because she has 

seen how I can fidget when I give my mind to it that she 

has felt her best chance, rightly enough, to be in making   

me as uneasy as possible. I think she's at bottom as 

pleased to have you put it on me as you yourself can   
possibly be to put it." 

" But what in the world, my dear man," Chad inquired in 

objection to this luminosity, " have I done to make Sally 

afraid ? "   

" You've been ' wonderful, wonderful,' as we say — we  

poor people who watch the play from the pit ; and that's ; 

what has, admirably, made her. Made her all the more 
effectually that she could see you didn't set about it on 
purpose. I mean set about affecting her as with fear." 

Chad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possi- ! 

bilities of motive. "I've only wanted to be kind and ' 





friendly, to be decent and attentive — and I still only want 
to be." 

Strether smiled at his comfortable clearness. " Well, 
there can certainly be no way for it better than by my 
taking the onus. It reduces your personal friction and 
your personal offence to almost nothing." 

Ah, but Chad, with his completer conception of the 
friendly, wouldn't quite have this ! They had remained 
on the balcony, where, after their day of great and prema- 
ture heat, the midnight air was delicious ; and they leaned 
back, in turn, against the balustrade, all in harmony with 
the chairs and the flower-pots, the cigarettes and the star- 
light. " The onus isn't really yours — after our agreeing so 
to wait together and judge together. That was all my 
answer to Sally," Chad pursued — " that we have been, 
that we are, just judging together." 

" I'm not afraid of the burden," Strether explained ; " I 
haven't come in the least that you should take it off me. 
I've come very much, it seems to me, to double up my 
fore-legs in the manner of the camel when he gets down 
on his knees to make his back convenient. But I've 
supposed you, all this while, to have been doing a lot 
of special and private judging — about which I haven't 
troubled you; and I've only wished to have your con- 
clusion first from you. I don't ask more than that; I'm 
quite ready to take it as it has come." 

Chad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of 
his smoke. "Well, I've seen." 

Strether waited a little, " I've left you wholly alone ; 
haven't, I think I may say, since the first hour or two 
— when I merely preached patience — so much as breathed 
on you." 

" Oh, you've been awfully good ! " 

" We've both been good then — we've played the game. 
We've given them the most liberal conditions." 

"Ah," said Chad, "splendid conditions! It was open 
to them, open to them " — he seemed to make it out, as he 
smoked, with his eyes still on the stars. He might, in 
quiet sport, have been reading their horoscope. Strether 
wondered meanwhile what had been open to them, and he 
finally let him have it. " It was open to them simply to 





let me alone ; to have made up their minds, on really ' 
seeing me for themselves, that I could go on well enough   
as I was," , 

Strether assented to this proposition with full lucidity, 
his companion's plural pronoun, which stood all for Mrs. J 
Newsome and her daughter, having no ambiguity for him. 
There was nothing, apparently, to stand for Mamie and I 
Jim ; and this added to our friend's sense of Chad's know- 
ing what he thought.   

" But they've made up their minds to the opposite — that J 
you can't go on as you are." ' 

" No," Chad continued in the same way ; " they won't  
have it for a minute." ! 

Strether on his side also reflectively smoked. It was as 
if their high place really represented some moral elevation ;  
from which they could look down on their recent past.   
" There never was the smallest chance, do you know, that 
they would have it for a moment." 

" Of course not — no real chance. But if they were  
willing to think that there was ! " I 

" They weren't willing." Strether had worked it all out.   
"It wasn't for you they came out, but for me. It wasn't 
to see for themselves what you're doing, but what Fin 
doing. The first branch of their curiosity was inevitably 
destined, under my culpable delay, to give way to the 
second ; and it's on the second that, if I may use the 
expression and you don't mind my marking the invidious 
fact, they've been of late exclusively perched. When 
Sarah sailed it was me, in other words, they were after." 

Chad took it in both with intelligence and with in- 
dulgence. " It is rather a business then — what I've let 
you in for ! " 

Strether had again a brief pause; which ended in a reply 
that seemed to dispose once for all of this element of com- 
punction. Chad was to treat it, at any rate, so far as they 
were again together, as having done so. "I was 'in' when 
you found me." 

" Ah, but it was you," the young man laughed, " who 
found 7)iey 

" I only found you out. It was you who found me in. 
It was all in the day's work for them, at all events, that 





they should come. And they greatly enjoyed it," Strether 
declared. 

" Well, I've tried to make them," said Chad. 

His companion did himself presently the same justice. 
"So have I. I tried even this very morning — while Mrs. 
Pocock was with me. She enjoys for instance, almost as 
much as anything else, not being, as I've said, afraid of 
me ; and I think I gave her help in that." 

Chad took a deeper interest. " Was she very, very 
nasty? " 

Strether debated. " Well, she was the important thing 
— she was definite. She was — at last — crystalline. And 
I felt no remorse. I saw that they must have come." 

"Oh, I wanted to see them for myself; so that if it 
were only for that ! " — Chad's own remorse was as small. 

This appeared almost all Strether wanted. " Isn't your 
having seen them for yourself then t/ie thing, beyond all 
others, that has come of their visit   " 

Chad looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to 
put it so. " Don't you count it as anything that you're 
dished — if you are dished? Are you, my dear man, 
dished ? " 

It sounded as if he were asking if he had caught cold or 
hurt his foot, and Strether, for a minute, but smoked and 
smoked. " I want to see her again. I must see her." 

" Of course you must." Then Chad hesitated. " Do 
you mean — a — mother herself?" 

" Oh, your mother — that will depend." 

It was as if Mrs. Newsome had somehow been placed 
by the words very far off. Chad, however, endeavoured in 
spite of this to reach the place. " What do you mean it 
will depend on ? " 

Strether, for all answer, gave him a longish look. " I 
was speaking of Sarah. I must positively — though she 
quite cast me off — see /tcr again. I can't part with her that 
way." 

" Then she was awfully unpleasant ? " 

Again Strether exhaled. " She was what she had to be. 
I mean that from the moment they're not delighted they 
can only be — well, what I admit she was. We gave them," 
he went on, " their chance to be delighted, and they've 





walked up to it, and looked all round it, and not taken 

it." 

"You can bring a horse to water !" Chad suggested. I 

" Precisely. And the tune to which, this morning, Sarah I 
wasn't delighted — the tune to which, to adopt your meta- ; 
phor, she refused to drink — leaves us on that side nothing 
more to hope." 

Chad had a pause, and then as if consolingly : " It was 
never of course really the least on the cards that they 
would be ' delighted.' " ' 

"Well, I don't know, after all," Strether mused. "I've  
had to come as far round. However" — he shook it off —  
" it's doubtless my performance that's absurd." 

" There are certainly moments," said Chad, " when you 
seem to me too good to be true. Yet if you are true," he  
added, " that seems to be all that need concern me." 

"I'm true, but I'm incredible. I'm fantastic and ridicu- ,t 
lous — I don't explain myself even to myself. How can  
they then," Strether asked, " understand me ? So I don't 'i 
quarrel with them." i  

" I see. They quarrel," said Chad rather comfortably,  
" with us." Strether noted once more the comfort, but his   
young friend had already gone on. " I should feel greatly 
ashamed, all the same, if I didn't put it before you again   
that you ought' to think, after all, tremendously well. I 

mean before giving up beyond recall " With which 

his insistence, as from a certain delicacy, dropped. 

Ah, but Strether wanted it. " Say it all, say it all." 

" Well, at your age, and with what — when all's said and 
done — mother might do for you and be for you." 

Chad had said it all, from his natural scruple, only to 
that extent ; so that Strether, after an instant, himself 
took a hand. " My absence of an assured future. The 
little I have to show toward the power to take care of 
myself. The way, the wonderful way, she would certainly 
take care of me. Her fortune, her kindness, and the 
constant miracle of her having been disposed to go even 
so far. Of course, of course," he summed it up. " There 
arc those sharp facts." 

Chad had meanwhile thought of another still. " And 
then isn't there your liking her so ?"
