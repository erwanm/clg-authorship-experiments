which was blown away and God 
have mercy on his soul amen' 

Then the impatient jury rejoined 
the main crowd, for the storm-cen- 
tre of interest was there — Sherlock 
Holmes. The miners stood silent and 
reverent in a half-circle, enclosing a 
large vacant space which included 
the front exposure of the site of the 
late premises. In this considerable 
space the Extraordinary Man was 
moving about, attended by his nephew 
with a lantern. With a tape he took 
measurements of the cabin site; of 
the distance from the wall of chaparral
to the road; of the height of the 
chaparral bushes; also various other 
measurements. He gathered a rag 
here, a splinter there, and a pinch 
of earth yonder, inspected them pro- 
foundly, and preserved them. He took 
the " lay " of the place with a pocket- 
compass, allowing t wo secon ds for 
magnetic variation. He took the time 
(Pacific) by his watch, correcting it 
for local time. He paced off the dis- 
tance from the cabin site to the corpse, 
and corrected that for tidal differen- 
tiation. He took the altitude with a 
pocket-aneroid, and the temperature 
with a pocket-thermometer. Finally 
he said, with a stately bow : 

"It is finished. Shall we return, 
gentlemen?'' 

He took up the line of march for the 
tavern, and the crowd fell into his 
wake, earnestly discussing and ad- 
miring the Extraordinary Man, and 
interlarding guesses as to the origin 
of the tragedy and who the author 
of it might be. 

"My, but it's grand luck having 

him here — hey, boys?'' said Ferguson. 

"It's the biggest thing of the cen- 
tury," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll 
go all over the world ; you mark my 
words." 

''You bet!" said Jake Parker the 
blacksmith. "It 'll boom this camp. 
Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" 

"Well, as you want m y opinion — 
if it's any sign of how I think about 
it, I can tell you this : yesterday I was 
holding the Straight Flush claim at 
two dollars a foot; Vd like to see the 
man that can get it at sixteen to- 
day' 

"Right you are, Wells-Fargol It's 
ofdel the grandest luck a new camp ever 
struck. Say, did you see him collar 
them little rags and dirt and things? 
What an eye ! He just can't over- 
look a clew — 'tain't in him." 

"That's so. And they wouldn't 
mean a thing to anybody else; but 
to him, why, they're just a book — 
large print at that." 

"Sure's you're born! Them odds 
and ends have got their little old secret, 
and they think there ain't anybody 
can pull it; but, land! when he sets 
his grip there they've got to squeal, 
and don't you forget it." 

"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he 
wasn't here to roust out the child;  
this is a bigger thing, by a long sight. 
Yes, sir, and more tangled up and 
scientific and intellectual.'' 

"I reckon we're all of us glad it's 
turned out this way. Glad? 'George! 
it ain't any name for it. Dontchu- 
know, Archy could 've learnt some- 
thing if he'd had the nous to stand by 
and take notice of how that man works 
the system. But no; he went poking 
up into the chaparral and just missed 
the whole thing." 

"It's true as gospel; I seen it 
myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll 
know better one of these days." 

"Say, boys, who do you reckon 
done it?'' 

That was a difficult question, and 
brought out a world of unsatisfying 
conjecture. Various men were men- 
tioned as possibilities, but one by one 
they were discarded as not being eli- 
gible. No one but young Hillyer had 
been intimate with Flint Buckner; no 
one had really had a quarrel with him ; 
he had affronted every man who had 
tried to make up to him, although not 
quite offensively enough to require 
bloodshed. There was one name that 
was upon every tongue from the start, 
but it was the last to get utterance 
— Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley 
that mentioned it. 

"Oh, well," the boys said, "of 
course weVe all thought of him, be- 
cause he had a million rights to kill 
Flint Buckner, and it was just his 
plain duty to do it. But all the same 
there's two things we can't get around : 
for one thing, he hasn't got the sand ; 
and for another, he wasn't anywhere 
near the place when it happened." 

"I know it," said Pat. "He was 
there in the billiard - room with us 
when it happened." 

" Yes, and was there all the time for 
an hour bejore it happened." 

"It's so. And lucky for him, too. 
He'd have been suspected in a minute 
if it hadn't been for that." 

HE tavern dining-room 
had been cleared of all 
its furniture save one 
six-foot pine table and 
a chair. This table was against one 
end of the room; the chair was on it; 
Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, 
impressive, sat in the chair. The 
public stood. The room was full. 
The tobacco smoke was dense, the 
stillness profound. 

The Extraordinary Man raised his 
hand to clomnand additional silence; 

held it in the air a few moments ; then, 
in brief, crisp terms he put forward 
question after question, and noted the Thinks 


answers with Um-ums, nods of the voice 

head, and so on. By this process he 
learned all about Flint Buckner, his 
character, conduct, and habits, that 
the people were able to tell him. It 
thus transpired that the Extraordinary 
Man's nephew was the only person in 
the camp who had a killing-grudge 
against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes 
smiled compassionately upon the wit- 
ness, and asked, languidly — 

''Do any of you gentlemen chance 
to know where the lad Fetlock Jones 
was at the time of the explosion?" 
A thunderous response followed — 
" In the billiard-room of this house !" 



" Ah. And had he just come in?'' 
Just "Been there all of an hour!'' 

Uons "Ah. It is about — about — well, 

about how far might it be to the scene 
of the explosion?" 

"All of a mile!" 

" Ah. It isn't much of an alibi, 'tis 
true, but—" 

A storm-burst of laughter, mingled 
with shouts of, " By jiminy, but he's 
chain-lightning !" and, " Ain't you sor- 
ry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the 
rest of the sentence, and the crushed 
witness drooped his blushing face in 
pathetic shame. The inquisitor re- 
sumed: 

"The lad Jones's somewhat distant 
connection with the case" (laughter) 
"having been disposed of, let us now 

call the e3;e-witnesses of the tragedy, 
and listen to what they have to say' 

He got out his fragmentary clews 
and arranged them on a sheet of card- 
board on his knee. The house held 
its breath and watched. 

"We have the longitude and the 
latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, 
and this gives us the exact loca- 
tion of the tragedy. We have the alti- 
tude, the temperature, and the degree 
of h umidity prev ailing — inestimably 
valuable, since they enable us to esti- 
mate with precision the degree of in- 
fluence which they would exercise 
upon the mood and disposition of the 
assassin at that time of the night." 
(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, 
"By George, but he's deep!") He 

fingered his clews. "And now let us 
'ivds sk these mute witnesses to speak 
to us. 

" Here we have an empty linen shot- 
bag. What is its message? This: 
that robbery was the motive, not re- 
venge. What is its further message? 
This : that the assassin was of inferior 
intelligence — shall we say light-witted, 
or perhaps approaching that? How 
do we know this? Because a person 
of sound intelligence would not have 
proposed to rob the man Buckner, 
who never had much money with him. 
But the assassin might have been a 
stranger? Let the bag speak again. 
I take from it this article. It is a bit 
of silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. 
Examine it, please — you — and 
you — and you. Now pass it back, 
please. There is but one lode on this 
coast which produces just that char- 
acter and color of quartz; and that is 
a lode which crops out for nearly two 
miles on a stretch, and in my opinion 
is destined, at no distant day, to con- 
fer upon its locality a globe-girdling 
celebrity, and upon its two hundred 
owners riches beyond the dreams of 
avarice. Name that lode, please.'' 

"The Consolidated Christian Sci- 
ence and Mary AnnT' was the prompt 
response. 

A wild crash of hurrahs followed, 
and every man reached for his neigh- 
bor's hand and wrung it, with tears 
in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Fergu- 
son shouted, "The Straight Flush is 
on the lode, and up she goes to a hun- 
dred and fifty a foot — you hear me I" 

When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed : 

'' We perceive, then, that three facts 
are established, to wit: the assassin 
was approximately light - witted ; he 
was not a stranger; his motive was 
robbery, not revenge. Let us pro- 
ceed. I hold in my hand a small frag- 
ment of fuse, with the recent smell of 
fire upon it. What is its testimony? 
Taken with the corroborative evidence 
of the quartz, it reveals to us that the 
assassin was a miner. What does it 
tell us further? This, gentlemen : that 
the assassination was consummated 
by means of an explosive. What 
else does it say? This: that the explosive
was located against the side 
of the cabin nearest the road — the 
front side — for within six feet of that 
spot I found it. 

" I hold in my fingers a burnt Swed- 
ish match — the kind one rubs on a 
safety-box. I found it in the road, 
622 feet from the abolished cabin. 
What does it say? This: that the 
train was fired from that point. What 
further does it tell us? This: that 
the assassin was left-handed. How 
do I know this? I should not be able 
to explain to you, gentlemen, how I 
know it, the signs being so subtle "uferte 

signs 

that only long experience and deep 
study can enable one to detect them. 
But the signs are here, and they are 
re-enforced by a fact which you must 
have often noticed in the great detec- 
tive narratives — that all assassins are 
left-handed." 

"By Jackson, that's so!'' said Ham 
Sandwich, bringing his great hand 
down with a resounding slap upon 
his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought 
of it before." 

"Nor II" "Nor I!" cried several. 
" Oh, there can't anything escape him 
— look at his eye!" 

"Gentlemen, distant as the mur- 
derer was from his doomed victim, he 
did not wholly escape injury. This 
fragment of wood which I now ex- 
hibit to you struck him. It drew 
blood. Wherever he is, he bears the 
telltale mark. I picked it up where 
he stood when he fired the fatal train." 

He looked out over the house from 
his high perch, and his countenance 
began to darken; he slowly raised 
his hand, and pointed — 
"There stands the assassin !"

For a moment the house was para- criminal 
lyzed with amazement ; then twenty 
voices burst out with: 

"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, Ml, not
Him? It's pure foolishness !" 

" Take care, gentlemen — be not 
hasty. Observe — he has the blood- 
mark on his brow' 

Hillyer turned white with fright. 
He was near to crying. He turned 
this way and that, appealing to every 
face for help and sympathy ; and held 
out his supplicating hands toward 
Holmes and began to plead: 



"Don oh, don't! I never did it; 
I give my word I never did it. The 
way I got this hurt on my forehead 
was — " 

"Arrest him, constable I" cried 
Holmes. "I will swear out the war- 
rant." 

The constable moved reluctantly for- 
ward — hesitated — stopped. 

Hillyer broke out with another ap- 
peal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do 
it; it would kill mother! You know 
how I got the hurt. Tell them, and 
to the rescue save me, Archy; save me!'' 

Stillman worked his way to the 
front, and said : 

"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be 
afraid." Then he said to the house, 
" Never mind how he got the hurt ; it 
hasn't anything to do with this case, 
and isn't of any consequence' 

"God bless you, Archy, for a true 
friend!" 

"HuiTah for Archyl Go in, boy, 
and play 'em a knock-down flush to 
their two pair 'n' a jack!" shouted 
the house, pride in their home talent 
and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty 
to it rising suddenly in the public 
heart and changing the whole atti- 
tude of the situation. 

Young Stillman waited for the noise 
to cease ; then he said, 

"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand 
by that door yonder, and Constable 
Harris to stand by the other one here, 
and not let anybody leave the room." 

" Said and done. Go on, old man!" 

"The criminal is present, I believe. 
I will show him to you before long, 
in case I am right in my guess. Now 
I will tell you all about the tragedy, 
from start to finish. The motive 
wasn't robbery ; it was revenge. The 
murderer wasn't light - witted. He 
didn't stand 622 feet away. He didn't 
get hit with a piece of wood. He didn't 
place the explosive against the cabin. 
He didn't bring a shot-bag with him, 
and he wasn't left-handed. With the 
exception of these errors, the distin- 
guished guest's statement of the case 
is substantially correct.'' 

A comfortable laugh rippled over 
the house; friend nodded to friend, as 
much as to say, ''That's the word, 
with the bark on it. Good lad, good 
boy. He ain't lowering his flag 
any!" 

The guest's serenity was not disturbed. 
Stillman resumed: 

" I also have some witnesses ; and I 
will presently tell you where you can 
find some more.'' He held up a piece 
of coarse wire; the crowd craned their 
necks to see. " It has a smooth coating 
of melted tallow on it. And here 
is a candle which is burned half-way 
down. The remaining half of it has 
marks cut upon it an inch apart. 

Soon I will tell you where I found 
these things. I will now put aside 
reasonings, guesses, the impressive 
hitching of odds and ends of clews 
together, and the other showy theatricals 
of the detective trade, and tell you 
in a plain, straightforward way just 
 how this dismal thing happened' 

' He paused a moment, for effect — to 

happened allow silence and suspense 
to intensify and concentrate the house's interest; 
then he went on : 

"The assassin studied out his plan 
with a good deal of pains. It was a 
good plan, very ingenious, and showed 
an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. 
It was a plan which was well calcu- 
lated to ward off all suspicion from its 
inventor. In the first place, he marked 
a candle into spaces an inch apart, 
and lit it and timed it. He found it 
took three hours to burn four inches 
of it. I tried it myself for half an hour, 
awhile ago, upstairs here, while the 
inquiry into Flint Buckner's character 
and ways was being conducted in 
this room, and I arrived in that way 
at the rate of a candle's consumption 
when sheltered from the wind. Hav- 
ing proved his trial-candle's rate, he 
blew it out — I have already shown it 
to you — and put his inch-marks on a 
fresh one. 

"He put the fresh one into a tin 
candlestick. Then at the five-hour 
mark he bored a hole through the 
candle with a red-hot wire. I have 
already shown you the wire, with a 
smooth coat of tallow on it — tal- 
low that had been melted and had 
cooled. 

"With labor — very hard labor, I 
should say — he struggled up through 
the stiff chaparral that clothes the 
steep hill-side back of Flint Buckner's 
place, tugging an empty flour-barrel 
with him. He placed it in that ab- 
solutely secure hiding-place, and in 
the bottom of it he set the candlestick. 
Then he measured off about thirty- 
five feet of fuse — the barrel's distance 
from the back of the cabin. He bored 

Lavfria barrel — here 
the mine he large gimlet he did it with. He 

went on and finished his work; and 
when it was done, one end of the fuse 
was in Buckner's cabin, and the other 
end, with a notch chipped in it to ex- 
pose the powder, was in the hole in 
the candle — timed to blow the place 
up at one o'clock this morning, pro- 
vided the candle was lit about eight 
o'clock yesterday evening — which I 

am betting it was — and provided there 
was an explosive in the cabin and 
connected with that end of the fuse — ddaits 

which I am also betting there was, 
though I can't prove it. Boys, the 
barrel is there in the chaparral, the 
candle's remains are in it in the tin 
stick ; the burnt-out fuse is in the gim- 
let-hole, the other end is down the hill 
where the late cabin stood. I saw 
them all an hour or two ago, when 
the Professor here was measuring off 
unimplicated vacancies and collecting 
relic5.ihat hadn't anything to do with 
the case,!' v 

He paused. The house drew a 
long, deep breath, shook its strained 
cords and muscles free and burst 
into cheers. 


"Dang him'' said Ham Sandwich, 
"that's why he was snooping around 
in the chaparral, instead of picking 
up points out of the P'fessor's game. 
Looky here — he ain't no fool, boys' 
"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" 
But Stillman was resuming: 
" While we were out yonder an hour 
or two ago, the owner of the gimlet 
and the trial-candle took them from a 
place where he had concealed them — 
it was not a good place — and carried 
them to what he probably thought 
was a better one, two hundred yards 
up in the pine woods, and hid them 
there, covering them over with pine 
needles. It was there that I found 
them. The gimlet exactly fits the 
hole in the barrel. And now — " 

The Extraordinary Man interrupted 
him. He said, sarcasticall} : 

"We have had a very pretty fairy- f 
tale, gentlemen — very pretty indeed.  

Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot 

"In-deed? This is interesting — this 
is very interesting. Perhaps you en- 
countered the assassin yourself?" 

"No, I encoimtered no one." 

"Ah. Then — if you will excuse 
the remark — I do not quite see the 
relevancy of the information." 

"It has none. At present. I say 
it has none — at present." He paused. 
Presently he resumed: "I did not en- 
counter the assassin, but I am on his 
track, I am sure, for I believe he is in 
this room. I will ask you all to pass 
one by one in front of me — here, where 
there is a good light — so that I can 
see your feet' 

A buzz of excitement swept the 
place, and the march began, the guest 
looking on with an iron attempt at 
gravity which was not an unqualified 
success. Stillman stooped, shaded 
his eyes with his hand, and gazed 
down intently at each pair of feet as 
it passed. Fifty men tramped monot- 
onously by — with no result. Sixty. 
Seventy. The thing was beginning 
to look absurd. The guest remarked, 
with suave irony, 

"Assassins appeal to be scar ce 
this evening." 

The house saw the humor of it, and 


refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. 
Ten or twelve more candidates tramped 
by — no, danced by, with airy and 
ridiculous capers which convulsed the 
spectators — then suddenl} Stillman 
put out his hand and said, 

" This is the assassin !" 
" Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhe- 
drim!'' roared the crowd; and at once 
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and 
dazzle and confusion of stirring re- 
marks inspired by the situation. 

At the height of the turmoil the 
guest stretched out his hand, com- 
manding peace. The authority of a 
great name and a great personality 
laid its mysterious compulsion upon 
the house, and it obeyed. Out of the 
panting calm which succeeded, the 
guest spoke, saying, with dignity 
and feeling: 

"This is serious. It strikes at an 
innocent life. Innocent beyond sus- 
picion! Innocent beyond perad vent- 
ure! Hear me prove it; observe how 
simple a fact can brush out of existence 
this witless lie. Listen. My friends, 
that lad was never out of my sight 
yesterday~evenTng at any time \" 

It made a deep impression. Men 
turned their eyes upon Stillman with 
grave inquiry in them. His face 
brightened, and he said, 

"I knew there was another one!" 
He stepped briskly to the table and 
glanced at the guest's feet, then up at 
his face, and said: "You were with 
him! You were not fifty steps from 

him when he lit the candle that by- 
and-by fired the powder .' (Sensor 
tion.) "And what is more, you furnished 
the matches yourself!'' matches 

plainly the guest seemed hit; it 
looked so to the public. He opened 
his mouth to speak; the words did 
not come freely. 

'' This — er — this is insanity — 
this—" 

Stillman pressed his evident ad- 
vantage home. He held up a charred 
match. 

''Here is one of them. I found it 
in the barrel — and there's another one 
there." 

The guest foimd his voice at once. 

"Yes — and put them there your- 
self." 


It was recognized as a good shot 
Stillman retorted: 

''It is wax — a breed unknown to 
this camp. I am ready to be searched 
for the box. Are you?" 

The guest was staggered this time 
— the dullest eye could see it. He 
fumbled with his hands ; once or twice 
his lips moved, but the words did not 
come. The house waited and watched, 
in tense suspense, the stillness adding 
effect to the situation. Presently Still- 
man said, gently, 

"We are waiting for your decision." 

There was silence again during 
several moments; then the guest an- 
swered, in a low voice, 

" I refuse to be searched." 

There was no noisy demonstration
but all about the house one voice 
after another muttered: 
"That settles it He's Archy's Arch's 
meat." 

What to do now? Nobody seemed 
to know. It was an embarrassing 
situation for the moment — merely, of 
course, because matters had taken 
such a sudden and unexpected turn 
that these unpractised minds were 
not prepared for it, and had come to a 
standstill, like a stopped clock, under 
the shock. But after a little the ma- 
chinery began to work again, tenta- 
tively, and by twos and threes the 
men put their heads together and 
privately buzzed over this and that 
and the other proposition. One of 
these propositions met with much fa- 
ingthe '» it was, to conf er upon the assassin 
assassin   q£ thanks for removing Flint 
Buclmer, and let him go. Butthe 
cooler heads opposed it, pointing out 
that addled brains in tHeEastern 
States would pronounce it a scandal, 
and make no end of foolish noise 
about it. In the end the cool heads 
got the upper hand, and obtained 
general consent to a proposition of 
their own, and their leader then called 
the house to order and stated it — to 
this effect: that Fetlock Jones be 
jailed and put upon his trial. 

The motion was carried. Appar- 
ently there was nothing further to do 
now, and the people were glad, for, 
privately, they were impatient to get 
out and rush to the scene of the trag- 
edy, and see whether that barrel and 
the other things were really there or 
not. 

But no— the break-up got a check. 
The surprises were not over yet. For 
a while Fetlock Jones had been silent- 
ly sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- 
ing excitements which had been fol- 
lowing one another so persistently 
for some time; but when his arrest 
and trial were decreed, he broke out 
despairingly, and said : 

"No! it's no use. I don't want 
any jail, I don't want any trial; I've 
had all the hard luck I want, and all 
the miseries. Hang me now, and let 
me out! It would all come out, any- 
way — there couldn't anjhing save 
me. He bas told it all, just as if he'd 
been with me and seen it — I don't

know how he found out; and you 
find the barrel and things, and then I 
The wouldn't have any chance any more. 

sl' I killed him; and you'd have done 
it too, if he'd treated you like a dog, 
and you only a boy, and weak and 
poor, and not a friend to help you." 

"And served him damned well 
right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. 
"Looky here, boys—" 

From the constable: "Order! Or- 
der, gentlemen!" 

A voice: "Did your uncle know 
what you was up to?" 

"No, he didn't." 

"Did he give you the matches, 
sure enough?" 



"Yes, he did; but he didn't know 
what I wanted them for' 

" When you was out on such a busi- 
ness as that, how did you venture to 
risk having him along — and him a 
detective? How's that?" 

The boy hesitated, fumbled with 
his buttons in an embarrassed way, 
then said, shyly. 


"I know about detectives, on account 
of having them in the family; 
and if you don't want them to find 
out about a thing, it's best to have 
them around when you do it." 

The cyclone of laughter which 
greeted this naive discharge of wis- 
dom did not modify the poor little 
waif's embarrassment in any large 
degree. 




From a Letter to Mrs. Stillman, Dated 
merely "Tuesday." 

ETLOCK JONES was 
put under lock and key 
in an unoccupied log 
cabin, and left there to 
await his trial. Constable Harris 
provided him with a couple of days' 
rations, instructed him to keep a 
good guard over himself, and prom- 
ised to look in on him as soon as 
further supplies should be due. 
Next morning a score of us went 

with Hillyer, out of friendship, and 
helped him bury his late relative, the 
unlaniented Buckner, and I acted as 
first assistant pall-bearer, Hillyer act- 
ing as chief. Just as we had finished 
our labors a ragged and melancholy 
stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, 
limped by with his head down, and I 
caught the scent I had chased around 
the globe. It was the odor of Para- 
dise to my perishing hopel 

In a moment I was at his side and 
had laid a gentle hand upon his shoul- 
der. He slumped to the ground as 
if a stroke of lightning had withered 
him in his tracks; and as the boys 
came running he struggled to his 
knees and put up his pleading hands 
to me, and out of his chattering jaws 
he begged me to persecute him no 
more, and said, 

"You have hunted me around the 
world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is 
my witness I have never done any 
man harm!" 

A glance at his wild eyes showed 

' us that he was insane. That was 
msane 

my work, mother! The tidings of 
your death can some day repeat the 
misery I felt in that moment, but noth- 
ing else can ever do it. The boys 
Hfted him up, and gathered about 
him, and were full of pity of him, and 
said the gentlest and touchingest 
things to him, and said cheer up and 
don't be troubled, he was among 
friends now, and they would take 
care of him, and protect him, and hang 
and man that laid a hand on him. 
They are just Uke so many mothers, 
the rough mining -camp boys are, 
when you wake up the south side of 
their hearts; yes, and just like so 
many reckless and unreasoning chil- 
dren when you wake up the opposite 
side of that muscle. They did every- 
thing they could think of to comfort 
him, but nothing succeeded imtil Wells- 
Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strat- 
egist, said, 

"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's 
troubling you, you needn't worry any 
more." 

"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, 
eagerly. 

"Because he's dead again." 

"Deadl Dead ! Oh, don't trifle 

with a poor wreck like me. Is he 
dead? On honor, now — is he telling 
me true, boys?'' 

"True as you're a-standing therel" 
said Ham Sandwich, and they all 
backed up the statement in a body. 

"They himg him in San Bernar- 
fff dino last week," added Ferguson, 

by mistake clinching the matter,
"whilst he was 

searching around after you. Mis- 
took him for another man. They're 
sorry, but they can't help it now." 

"They're a-building him a monu- 
ment," said Ham Sandwich, with the 
air of a person who had contributed 
to it, and knew. 

"James Walker" drew a deep sigh 
— evidently a sigh of relief — and said 
nothing; but his eyes lost something 
in their wildness, his countenance 
cleared visibly, and its drawn look 
relaxed a little. We all went to our 
cabin, and the boys cooked him the Soothing 
best dinner the camp could furnish 
the materials for, and while they 
were about it Hillyer and I outfitted 
him from hat to shoe-leather with 
new clothes of ours, and made a come- 
ly and presentable old gentleman of 
him. "Old" is the right word, and
