Here are the bedrooms,” explained Mai'igold, 
and here is the woodshed, where you can wash in 
summer, and in winter you let the water in the 
pump run down, so it will not freeze, and after 
you have pumped awhile it comes back. Here you 
go upstairs,” and she led the way. 

“ Oh, it is so fine and large, and in summer such 
beautiful trees ! Oh, husband, it will seem like the 
old home! ” with a kind of rapture in her voice. 
She spoke with quite an accent, but it sounded 
pretty. 

Yes, yes,” he returned. The Graus were 
very kind to us, lady, and helped put us on our 
feet, and they have prospered, so why should not 
we? ” 

“ Oh, yes. And the garden and chickens I My 
fingers have ached to have a garden. They gave 
us some vegetables, but Mr. Grau liked to do all 
the gardening himself. But at home I did it, and 
the flowers I You people do not seem to care for 
flowers.” 

We used to, but when Mr. Firth was gone 
there was so much to look after, and sewing for 
the children.” 

‘'Ach! That is so. We have but two, but 
now they will begin to help, besides going to school. 
And you cannot think of all the gladness that will 


be mine when I come here to live,” and her eyes 
shone with delight. 

“ We will have the place cleaned up and a good 
coat of whitewash put on when this rubbish is 
cleared away. We do not mean to take much of 
it. It is old and worn — if there is anything that 
would do you any good ” 

“ Oh, we have saved out a little to buy things 
when we had a better home.” 

“ But I do not mean that,” Mrs. Mann inter- 
posed quickly. Some have already gone away; 
they are not worth buying ; but you would be wel- 
come to them while they last.” 

Oh, you are too good in the matter. No, 
you must let us pay as we can, and we will be 
glad of the waiting-time until we can get turned 
about.” 

Mr. Bachman had been out with Linn inspecting 
the garden, the trees, and the chicken-house, that 
the boy had patched up many a time. They had 
trudged through the snowy paths, but his face was 
alight with satisfaction. 

“ Ach! But it is like a bit of a dream, Freda! 
We will come, and it will be like when we were 
first married, and we will make things lovely and 
begin a home over again as we did then. I thank 
you so much, madam, that you will let us have the 




nice house and all the garden. We shall live like 
princes.’' 

He talked rather more brokenly than his wife. 
She went to him now and clasped both hands. 

“ Oh, John,” she cried, ‘‘ we shall be so happy! 
There have been days when my heart was one big 
ache for the home and friends across the ocean, 
just as if I should never take root here. But now 
— oh, we shall be so happy once more when the 
spring and the blossoms come.” 

Mrs. Mann was truly moved by their childlike 
joy. Presently they veered around to business. 
They would like to come by the first of February, 
as the Graus wanted to repair their house some- 
what. And, yes, they would be delighted with the 

bedstead and the old bureau and whatever else 



Mrs. Mann cared to leave, and she promised the 
house should be in order for them. 

They took their departure with many protesta- 
tions of gratitude. 

I am so glad they are going to be happy here,” 
exclaimed Marigold. I think I should be angry 
if any one came in who despised the place and 
found fault.” 

Houses to rent are so scarce that no one feels 
inclined to cavil. We will have it whitewashed 



and freshly painted inside, and maybe before long 
on the outside. They are the kind of people who 
will take good care of it. And now, girls, let us 
finish the other chest, and take some of this rub- 
bish back into the garret, for time is flying. We 
will have to come over again.” 

They were barely through when Dan returned, 
and it was nearing night. So they put out the fire 
and picked up a few parcels and were off. 

The children made as much of a time as if their 
mother had never been away before. And there 
were piles of lumber that Tip declared were just 
dandy to climb over. 

“ Mr. Jones is going to bring a man to-morrow, 
and they will get to work right away,” said Ama- 
ryllis. “ Won’t it be splendid. Mother ! The chil- 
dren do litter up the library so.” 

Lai’s lost her nice Christmas doll,” announced 
Rhoda after Mrs. Alden had said they had not 
been troublesome. 

Ain’t lost neder,” was the decided reply. 

But you don’t know where it is ! ” in a tri- 
umphant tone, for Rhoda was shrewd enough to 
think now the child would betray herself, but she 
was mistaken. 

“ Do so, too, now ! ” and the little lips shut 
tightly. 


AT GRAFTON 


in 


‘‘Well, where?’’ 

Lai was not to be caught. Throwing up her 
chin, she said, “ San’t tell you.” 

“ What about Dolly ? ” asked their mother. 

“ Lai won’t let her come to tea, an’ I set the 
table all nice and had some crackers, an’ Lai 
snatched her away.” 

‘' Oh, Laurel; that wasn’t nice ! ” 

Laurel turned very red, but was slowly acquiring 
methods of defense. 

“ She tookened it all the time. An’ it wasn’t 
her dolly. An’ I won’t have it named Bella 
Clumpus.” 

“ Columbia, you mean. I wouldn’t like that, 
either.” 

“ No, Isabella Columbus,” said Rhoda, “ because 
Chan told me ” — hesitating — “ that they sailed 
’way ’crost the ocean. An’ now I know she’s cry- 
ing ’cause she’s so lonesome. I looked all up in 
the garret.” 

Mrs. Mann laughed. 

“ An’ it’s my dolly. She san’t take it ’way 
from me.” 

Rhoda, you never cared to play with a doll. 
That is why I thought you’d like the dishes. Can’t 
you agree to play together ? ” 

“ I don’t like dirty, limpy, everyday rag dolls. 





I want a nice one all dressed up, and a carriage for 
her, like Katy Burnham’s.” 

You couldn’t wheel her in the snow.” 

Well, then, a sleigh. A teeny sleigh with 
jingly bells, and a blanket with fur on it.” 

“Will the moon answer?” asked her mother 
laughingly. “ Your wants seem to increase with 
prosperity.” 

Rhoda couldn’t quite grasp the last word, and 
was nonplussed. 

“ I’m doin’ for ‘ Muver Goose ’ to read to my 
everyday dolly. Can’t I bring it up ’long with 
you?” 

“ Yes,” answered her mother. 

“ I wish I had a nice Sunday dolly that could be 
played with on week-days. I’m so lonesome,” in a 
most lugubrious tone. 

“ You can’t have any more things until the play- 
room is finished. It’s queer, your wanting a doll. 
Tabby must be lonesome in the little old house. 
Suppose to-morrow you go and keep her com- 
pany ? ” 

“ I’d like to go to that nice school.” 

“Anything else?” 

Mrs. Mann began to make herself ready for 
dinner. Laurel read very spiritedly. Dolly’s 
complexion was losing its fairness, and her white 




apron was undeniably dingy. Rhoda felt herself 
very ill-used, and sat down at about the middle 
of the stairs and tried to squeeze out a few tears, 
then said to herself : 

I wish my new father would come. He’s 
gooder than mother, and I’ll get him to buy me a 
doll bigger than Lai’s, because I am a bigger girl,” 
and she found great comfort in the reasoning. 

But there’s lots of troubles in this world, and I’m 
a weary traveler here,” from a hymn the children 
sang. But I don’t know any one in Heaven, 
though father’s there, and grandmother, but, then, 
they went ’fore I could remember. I’ve got the 
new father now, and I like him very much. And 
if you go to Heaven you can’t come back, it’s so 
far. O dear ! ” 

Mrs. Mann had brushed Lai’s pretty hair and 
put on a clean white apron, and now she called 
Rhoda. Mrs. Alden was lighting up the rooms, 
and at the bright greeting of a familiar voice in 
the hall Rhoda sprang to the new father, who 
carried her upstairs, and she gave herself resign- 
edly to the beautifying process. 

“Well, how did you succeed?” Mr. Mann 
inquired of his wife, with interest. 

“Oh, they came and were delighted. They are 
going to be very happy there, and it really comforts me. 
I couldn’t help recalling Tip’s crying 
over the little old house. But it must be cleaned 
up, and a coat of paint inside ” 

“ And outside as well, and that must be kept red. 
The little old red house! I don’t want the chil- 
dren ever to forget it. Why, it brought me the 
joy of my life.” 

“ I wonder if any one else would think 
so?” 

But, you see,” laughing as he kissed her, I 
don’t want any one else to think so. It’s just my 
own, and what I’ve been heart-sick for many a 
time. So if I am happy in my belief ” 

“ I don’t just know how to get about the work. 
It must be whitewashed.” 

Why, Dan does that capitally. He’s a good 
painter as well.” 

“ But, you see, I shall have to raise some money, 
as I used up my pension. Whether my credit will 
bear the strain ” — with a touch of merry humor in 
her voice. 

People can always raise money on unencum- 
bered real estate,” in a grave tone. 

“ But, you see, it is the children’s ; yet it has been 
a very good home for me.” 

“ Then I shall have to be your banker. Of 
course I shall expect interest. But I am glad you 




are likely to have such a nice tenant. Now you 
must take out what things you want.” 

“ And there was a rather funny happening. Oh, 
and I am five dollars richer, though it went against 
my conscience to take it when some one had been so 
good to me.” 

Then she repeated Mr. Yates’s call and his desire 
for a “ vandue,” at which he laughed a little, and 
then said : “ Well, goodness and kindliness haven’t 
all died out of the world and left us stranded.” 

Goldie and Prim came in fresh and merry, and 
they were summoned to dinner. Chan rehearsed 
Mr. Jones’s doings and sayings, and the girls’ day 
lost nothing by the repetition. Rilla was very 
much interested. 

“ And there are some old books I want to keep,” 
said Linn, “ that lot about flowers and — oh, why 
didn’t I think to look them over ! • And I am glad 
the Bachmans are real nice. They would have 
been glad to take the chickens.” 

“ And Tabby ? ” 

‘‘ Oh, he patted her and rubbed her head, and 
she purred. He’s fond of cats, so she’s sure of a 
good home. And it will be nice to go over and 
see how they get along. Mother, I think you’re in 
luck.” 

Mother smiled. 


ii


Oh, how cheerful it was to sit round the fire 
afterward and talk! There was the plan of the 
playroom, with its closets on the one side and the 
windows on the other. Laurel wanted her little 
chair from the old house, and they all thought up 
something dear to them. 

Why, you’ll have half the old stuff over here,” 
said their mother. 

“ I just hope it won’t snow to-morrow,” 
exclaimed Linn. I want to see Mr. Jones 
work.” 

It’s nice starlight now,” announced Chan. 

“ But you ought all to go to bed. I am really 
tired. No, Laurel, I can’t hold you to-night. And 
Goldie, you look half asleep,” said Mrs. Mann. 

“ I’m going straight to bed,” she replied. It’s 
funny, people generally pack up before they move 
— we move, and pack up afterward. Good-night, 
everybody,” throwing kisses. 

In a little while the house was dark and quiet, 
for even Chan was not allowed to sit up all hours 
of the night reading. But they were bright enough 
the next morning. 

Like the children, I quite long to stay and see 
how things go on,” said Mr. Mann, “ but duty calls 
and I must obey. I’ll try to get home early.” 

As he stepped into the train one of the neighbors 




nodded and said good-morning. It was Mr. Brad- 
ley, whose boys he had admired in the summer. 

He held out his hand cordially. “ I suppose one 
may still congratulate you, Mr. Mann ? Tve won- 
dered what you meant to do with that big house, 
and now I suppose you find it about right. After 
all, children are the life of a house, that is, if you 
really care for them. It is what makes the home.” 

“ Yes,” returned Mr. Mann heartily. “ I was 
married fifteen years, and all that time longed for 
them. And now I count myself a happy father. 
They are the kin of love and longing.” 

There was one little boy you sent to a hos- 
pital ? ” 

Yes. The Children’s Hospital. I’d sent a 
little newsboy there, who had to lose his leg, and 
knew how kind they were. This little fellow had 
a fall, and his hip was hurt. He might have been 
lamed for life, but he’s all right now, a sweet little 
chap, and gay as a lark. There are three boys and 
five girls ; the youngest, twins of six.” 

‘‘ Why, you might send out two for adoption. 
Four is my ideal family, half of them girls. We’ve 
hoped for some girls, but have only two boys.” 

Yes, I used to watch them last summer, and 
envy you. But now I don’t envy the king on his 
throne,” and Mr. Mann gave a heartsome laugh 


ii


that was good to hear. “ Where do your boys go 
to school ? ” 

“To the Morton School, just in the edge of 
Ridgewood, and built partly for t le accommoda- 
tion of this suburb. I like a public school for boys. 
This has a sensible principal, and a fine corps of 
teachers. And in pleasant weather the walk does 
them good. How many are old enough ? ” 

“ The two boys. We shall have to consider 
about the girls. You see, I am quite new to 
parental cares, and I want to do my best.” 

“ I think you need not be afraid, Mr. Mann. 
And allow me to say that I admire your courage 
and enthusiasm. I should like to see them. We 
have talked of calling when you were really 
settled.” 

“We shall be glad to see you, and please bring 
the boys. Ours, you see, are rather strange here, 
and, as one may say, out of companionship by the 
change. We shall be glad to welcome our neigh- 
bors.” 

Then they branched into business matters. Mr. 
Bradley was pleased with the uprightness and free- 
dom from any pretense, yet there was nothing 
bordering on vanity or aggressiveness, and he 
seemed to understand himself and the world very 
well. 




“We must call on them soon,” he said to Mrs. 
Bradley that evening. “ He has such a large heart 
for children that the eight seem none too many. 
I am really curious to see them.” 

Mr. Mann took an hour or two hunting up gifts, 
and what with a kindly “ New Year ” to the men 
he was an hour late. 

“ And the meat pie is so nice,” declared Rilla. 
“ Just the right shade of brown, but it won’t fall 
or get soggy, Mrs. Alden says. Oh, I do wonder 
what has happened ! There are accidents ” 

“ But we won’t cross bridges until we come to 
them,” said her mother. “ A little thing may have 
detained him.” 


CHAPTER VII 


BRIMFUL OF FUN 

They were all so glad to see him and Tip so 
starved for his dinner that no comment was made 
on the parcels he laid down in the corner of the 
hall. It was cold, and there were round pellets 
of snow driving about, but they had a merry din- 
ner, and then they took him out to see the joists 
that had been set and a bit of siding nailed on. 

“ It was frozen so hard that he had to take a 
pick to make a hole. And when he went down a 
little way it was all soft again,” explained Tip. 

“ Yes, that was below the frost line.” 

Well, why doesn’t it freeze all the way 
down? ” 

“ Because we would be all summer thawing 
out,” returned Prim quickly. 

“ And Mr. Jones said he’d come around to-mor- 
row and work if you didn’t object,” began Linn. 

He didn’t hold to making any great fuss over 
New Year’s.” 

“ Don’t we hang up our stockings again ? ” asked 
Tip. ‘‘ We did in the old house.” 



No,’ answered their mother quickly. “ You 
all had enough at Christmas.” 

Mr. Mann made a funny face as he looked at 
his wife, and she thought of the parcels in the 
corner. 

Of course, he must go out and see what the two 
men had done. He said he had no objection to 
their working; the sooner they were through, the 
better it would suit him. 

While they were gone, Mrs. Mann picked up the 
parcels and hid them in the closet. 

She had been very busy all day rearranging the 
rooms the twins occupied, and fixing her machine. 
She was so glad to have one of her very own. She 
finished up a dress for Goldie that they had 
thought quite grand in the old house. Goldie’s 
gray coat would do very well with some bands 
of fur, the best out of a shoulder cape she had 
worn. 

“ And your turn will come next,” she had said 
smilingly to Prim. 

“ Oh, I’m not going to be set up with pride and 
have an awful fall, for you know the ice freezes 
the slippery side up in winter,” and there was a 
twinkle in Prim’s eye. She never was over- 
anxious about her clothes. 

Oh, how cold it was! They came in and shut 





out the playroom and the fine snow, and had some 
nuts and asked riddles until bedtime. Then Mr. 
Mann said to his wife: 

Why not have the pleasure over again ? I do 
like to see them brimming over with delight.” 

You will be too indulgent. What did you 
get ? ” 

“ Rhoda coaxed me for a doll. And I got a 
pretty collar of fur for both of the girls, and books 
and candy. I really couldn’t think of anything 
else.” 

They may have the candy and the books ” 

“ And the girls their collars ! ” 

She laughed. ‘‘ But Rhoda can’t have the doll 
at present. She’s very captious now about her 
dishes. Laurel has put hers away somewhere, and 
keeps her secret. She absolutely loves her old rag 
doll.” 

“Oh, I must tell you; I became quite friendly 
with Mr. Bradley this morning. His two boys go 
in to Ridgewood to school, and I think Linn and 
Chan had better go. The new term begins next 
Monday, but we won’t hurry about the girls.” 

“We will see how they get on at Sunday-school. 
And I want to call at Miss Raynor’s.” 

“ Chan must take music lessons, and some of 
the girls, if they want to.” 




Yes, but there will be plenty of time. There 
will be so much to do in the years to come. Do 
not crowd in too much now,” and her sweet smile 
tempered his extravagant thoughts. 

They were merrily enough wishing a ‘‘ Happy 
New Year ” all around the house. It was not 
very early, and the sound of the hammer caused 
them all to rush out to see if the workmen were 
really there. When they came in each child 
found a pretty box of candy by his or her plate, 
and Mr. Mann admitted to himself that they were 
very well satisfied over the simple gift. 

The storm had not amounted to much, but it was 
still gray and cloudy. The snow remained, as 
there was not much traveling, and Mr. Mann said 
if they would like to take a ride, they might, as 
Dan had some errands to do. Chan did not care, 
but Tip was eager, and Linn and the two girls 
completed the party. 

Rilla was much engrossed with housewifely arts, 
and followed Mrs. Alden like a shadow, asking no 
end of questions, but not in any annoying manner. 
She was anxious to do everything properly, to im- 
prove her modes of speech, to adopt pretty, polite 
ways. And when Mrs. Alden said she was so 
deft she would make a nice housekeeper, she flew 



to the dictionary to look it up. Yes, there it was 
— fit, apt, ingenious, neat-handed — and she came 
back with a happy light in her eyes. 

'‘Couldn’t we just stop at Mrs. Briggs’s?’’ 
asked Marigold. I want to wish some one a 
Happy New Year.” 

Yes,” returned her mother with a smile. 

And a merry time they had! Mrs. Briggs de- 
clared they couldn’t have given her a greater treat. 
Grandma just overflowed with delight, and hoped 
they would have many happy years, and that all 
the girls would make as good women as their 
mother before them, and that they should always 
lot on Linn, as he had almost belonged to them. 
Lidie didn’t believe there was another boy in all 
Denby as willing and cheerful. 

“ If there was,” said Mr. Briggs, I’d go after 
him this blessed minnit.” 

Then Mrs. Briggs exhumed a plateful of 
doughnuts from the oven, and insisted that they 
needed something to warm up with for their cold 
ride. 

“If it hadn’t been for you, Dan, I am afraid 
we would have had to stay to dinner. How much 
they do care about mother,” said Prim, when they 
were settled in the sleigh. 



“ Well, mother is splendid,’’ returned Goldie. 

And she’s a lady like Mrs. Burnham. How 
queer some of these country people are! ” 

They thought first they wouldn’t get out when 
they reached the store, but Mr. Beers said the 
girls had gone out to spend the day, and mother 
was all alone and would feel much hurt if they 
didn’t come in, so they consented. Dan had some 
things to look up for his household. 

Mrs. Beers was quite as glad to see them, but 
plied them with questions that would have been 
rather embarrassing if Tip had not taken the floor. 
He had been quite distanced in the other call ; now 
he managed to elaborate the subject of the new 
playroom, and his train of cars that had a real bell 
on the engine, and when you wound them up they 
ran like sixty, but they didn’t like carpet to go 
over; it was so soft and woolly. And father 
brought them home boxes of candy, but mother 
said Santa Claus gave away all his things on 
Christmas, and you had to buy them out of the 
store afterward. 

Then Mrs. Beers brought out a mince pie and 
called in both Linn and Dan, and the children had 
to admit that it was good. And you might just 
as well stay a while longer,” said she. “ Why, I 
haven’t heard half the news ’bout your mother. If 





she wasn’t lucky! ’Tain’t many folks gets such a 
chance.” 

Marigold rose and said they must go, and Mrs. 
Beers begged them to come again when they could 
stay longer, and hoped their mother wouldn’t feel 
too grand to be neighborly. 

Then Dan had to stop at his own house and 
leave some parcels. They were late for lunch. 

“ But I don’t want a mouthful ! ” declared Prim. 
“ I’m just stuffed with mince pie and dough- 
nuts.” 

“ Oh, Primrose I ” exclaimed her mother reprov- 
ingly. 

“ Well, we really couldn’t help it. The dough- 
nuts were splendid, and it seemed so like old times 
at the Briggses’. They were all so glad to see us 
and sent ever so much love to you. We were care- 
ful, Mother, truly now, and I think Tip did set off 
things, but it was mostly about the playroom and 
the snow man and Dan’s room in the carriage 
house.” 

But Linn put his arms about his mother’s neck 
when he found her alone, and said in a rather hes- 
itating tone: 

Oh, Mother, do you think Mr. Mann will ever 
get tired of having so many of us? People 
think ” 




But, Linn, I begged you not to discuss any of 
these points 

Oh, I didn’t. But Mr. Beers wants me back, 
he really does. He’s taken Alfy Dixon, but he 
doesn’t like him very well. And he said that — 
he’d be glad to have me come back, and I thought 
— there are so many of us ” 

Oh, my boy, don’t let that disturb you. You . 
can pay back in being a good, loving son, and now 
he is thinking of your education. He wishes you 
to start in school Monday morning, and I want 
you to do your best, and in a few years you may 
be able to help with the others. It was kind in 
Mr. Beers, but no one will get tired of you yet 
awhile. I want your new father to be proud of 
you, and I want you to be a kind, upright, un- 
selfish boy.” 

He kissed her tenderly and said in a rather 
tremulous voice, “ I’ll try to deserve his goodness 
and his love.” 

New Year’s calls had not quite gone out, or else 
some of the neighbors dropped in from curiosity, 
making this an excuse. The Consadine brothers 
came in with good wishes and congratulations, and 
though at first they had stood aghast at the thought 
of so many children in their orderly settlement, 
they were too well bred to make any remark. 





Chan had been sitting at the piano, and Mr. Mann 
called in Linn, and there really seemed nothing ob- 
jectionable in these boys. 

‘'But weren’t they funny?” exclaimed Mari- 
gold afterward. The other children had kept very 
quiet in the library. “ They seemed as if they 
were wound up and set going by a spring, like Lai’s 
doll.” 

“ And the smaller one just repeated the latter 
part of the other’s sentence, as if he wasn’t able to 
think for himself, or maybe he hadn’t any ideas. 
Rilla and Goldie, when we get to be grown ladies, 
I sha’n’t copy either of you. I’ll have a way of 
my own.” 

“ Which you will be quite welcome to. I should 
hate an echo. And I hope mother won’t ever 
dress us alike, as Mrs. Ladd did her three girls 
last summer, and Phrony Beers said their mother 
bought a whole piece of that gingham.” 

“ And to think we won’t need to wear second- 
hand clothes any more! ” 

“ Well, Aunt Kitty’s things were new in Denby. 
Mary Gladden said she just envied me my new suit 
that first Sunday I wore it; she thought it so 
stylish.” 

They all laughed a little. 

Rhoda sat in her corner playing tea, and she had 





some real cake and her box of candy. She was 
entertaining some high-up company, and had her 
pretty dishes out. There were Queen Isabella and 
Queen Victoria, and Mrs. Filigree — the name had 
a fine sound — and the little girl who lived next door 
and looked out of the window, whose name was 
Gladys, Dan said. They talked about Columbus, 
and Rhoda said that Queen Isabella was glad 
he did not get wrecked among the icebergs. 
But his boat was all worn out, and he would have 
to get a new one, which would cost a good deal of 
money, more than fifty dollars. And Queen Vic- 
toria said that America was a nice country, and he 
could just as well stay as not. So he stayed, and 
that is the way we came to have a country. 

“ That is pretty good for you, Rhoda,” said 
Prim. Pm glad to see you in such exalted com- 
pany.” 

I just wasn’t talking to you. Now you’ve 
druv ’em all off home.” 

“ Driven, my child. ‘ Druv ’ is an importation 
from Denby, where grammar goes on crutches. 
There, Rhoda, we are going away. Good-by, 
sweetest.” 

“ They are mean things, anyhow,” and the child 
gave several tearless sniffs. “ I wish I could have 
a playhouse all to myself.” 




Mr. Evans called in the evening and brought a 
young friend with him, and they had some music, 
which made Chan very happy. 

“ I think we shall gather a circle of friends pres- 
ently,” Mr. Mann commented. 

The next morning he gave some orders to Mr. 
Jones. If they could get the place inclosed before 
the next storm, it would be an excellent thing. 

“ That’s what I am trying for,” was the reply. 

Linn looked up wistfully. “ Couldn’t I go 
with you and do something?” he asked. “I’m 
pretty good at figures and writing.” 

“ Why, that’s nice of you, my lad,” and the smile 
set the boy’s pulses a-tingle. “ Yes, I’d like to 
have you. I was going to walk down ” 

“ I’m not afraid of a walk. At first I walked 
down to the store every day, and it was a mile to 
school.” 

“ Get your coat, then.” 

Linn kissed his mother and started off with a 
light heart. Perhaps when he had been at school 
a year he might go down to the factory every day. 
If he were the oldest instead of Rilla ! But he had 
grown an inch in six months. 

He had a very happy day, and Mr. Mann was 
surprised at the boy’s quickness and his real desire 
to be of service. It was a very busy day for him. 




as he did not want to come down on Saturday. 
They went out and had a nice lunch. He began to 
feel quite well acquainted with Mr. Ross, who 
said, “ You will make a smart business man some 
day.” 

Then, just as they were getting ready to return, 
the last mail came in, bringing some orders that 
had to be looked over and considered. 

Just make a note of what you think best,” re- 
marked Mr. Ross, “ and I’ll follow instructions to- 
morrow.” 

“ I don’t know about this new firm, Morris & 
Gresham. We had better look up their standing 
and their vouchers. It’s a pretty big order from 
unknown people.” 

I think we sent some circulars to them, and 
they asked for a price list two or three weeks 
ago. 

“ And my mind was so full of other things 
then,” laughing. “ Yes, I’ll help look them up and 
take the next train.” 

They found the firm had a good standing, and 
they said a pleasant good-night to Mr. Ross. They 
had to wait in the station some time, and then, 
when they were about half-way on their journey, 
there had been an accident to a freight train that 
still littered up the track. 




They waited at home and wondered a little. Tip 
was hungry and sleepy, and had played himself 
tired, which made him a little cross. And Laurel 
wanted “ to go to bed wiv Dolly, who was tiwed 
to pieces.’’ 

‘‘ You children had better have some supper and 
go to bed,” said their mother. 

For a wonder they consented, and the three were 
soon asleep. 

“ And our nice dinner will be spoiled,” com- 
plained Amaryllis. 

Dan drove down to meet the next train, and 
waited. Then came the message, “ Detention. 
Soon be all right,” so he went on waiting. 

‘‘What do you suppose has happened?” said 
Prim almost under her breath ; “ and Linn, too.” 

“ Oh, don’t,” entreated Rilla. “ God wouldn’t 
let anything like misfortune come to us now, 
surely.” 

“ But it always does come when you are hap- 
piest,” subjoined Marigold. “ And mother has 
grown so sweet and pretty ” 

“ Wasn’t that bells ? ” Chan and the girls 
rushed to the door. Yes, it surely was, coming 
nearer and nearer on the frosty air. They could 
have shouted for very joy, but that great joy is 
quiet. 




Why, it was worth it all to have this delightful 
welcome from wife and children. He could 
hardly get into the hall. 

'' I was busy at first, then there was a deten- 
tion ; no accident to our train, though, only a wait 
until the track was cleared.” But he gathered 
from their faces, that had not grown tranquil yet, 
that there had been some anxiety. And there had 
been years with no one to care how he came or 
went. Yes, he was a very happy man. 

“ Oh, it was too bad to spoil your dinner ” 

he began in the midst of the apology. 

Well, then, we’ll all share together, and it 
won’t seem nearly so spoiled,” said Prim with a 
laugh that was the least bit tremulous. 

And I’ve earned a holiday for to-morrow, so I 
can help with the playroom. And Linn has been 
studying the typewriter and filing letters and do- 
ing ever so many things for me. I don’t wonder 
Mr. Beers wanted to keep him.” 

Linn smiled and colored warmly. 

Mr. Jones had his wish, the promised storm held 
off. The siding of the playroom was completed, 
and the sashes put in, and another week would see 
the inside finished. The children were picking up 
every little piece for blocks, building playhouses 
galore. The twins begged some kitchen spoons
