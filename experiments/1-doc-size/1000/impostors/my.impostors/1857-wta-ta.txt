The needed lesson was soon administered ; for just 
as Ben was making one of his lowest bows in hia 
semi-conscious condition, the bow of the boat ran 
upon a concealed rock, which caused her to keel over 
on one side, and very gently pitch the sleeper into 
the river. 

Of course, this catastrophe brought the com* 
mander of the expedition to his senses, and roused 
the helmsman to a sense of his own delinquency; 




though it is clear that, as there were no light houses
on the banks of the river, and the intricacies of the 
channel had never been denned and charted for the 
benefit of the adventurous navigator, no human fore- 
thought could have provided against the accident. 

Harry put the boat about, and assisted Lis dripping 
shipmate on board again. The ducking he had re- 
ceived did not operate very favorably upon Ben's 
temper, and he roundly reproached his companion for 
his carelessness. The steersman replied with becom- 
ing spirit to this groundless charge, telling him he 
had better keep his eyes open the rest of the night. 
Wet and chilly as he was, Ben couldn't help growl- 
ing ; and both evidently realized that the affair was 
not half as romantic as they had adjudged it to be an 
hour or two before. 

" Never mind it, Ben. If we fail once let us try 
again — that's all." 

" Try again ? You want to drown me, don't you," 
snarled Ben. 

Harry assured him he did not, and called his at- 
ten lion to the, sound of dashing waters, which could 
now be plainly heard. They were approaching the 




rocks, and it was certain from the noise that difficult 
navigation was before them. Harry proposed to haul 
up by the river's side, and wait for daylight ; to which 
proposition, Ben, whose ardor was effectually cooled 
by the bath he had received, readily assented. 

Accordingly they made fast the painter to a ttee 
on trie shore, and both ot them disembarked. While 
Harry was gathering up a pile of dead leaves for a 
bed, Ben amused himself by wringing out his wet 
clothes. 

; ' Suppose we make a fire, Harry?" suggested 
Ben ; and it would certainly have been a great luxury 
to one in his damp condition. 

" No ; it will betray us," replied Harry, with 
alarm. 

" Humph ! It is easy enough for you to talk, who 
are warm and dry," growled Ben. " I am going to 
have a fire, any how." 

In vain Harry protested. Ben had some matches 
ia the boat, and in a few minutes a cheerful fire 
blazed in the forest. As the leader of the enterprise 
felt its glowing warmth, his temper was sensibly im- 
pr' ed. and he even had the hardihood to laugh at


his late misfortune. But Harry did not caie jusl 
then whether his companion was pleasant or sour, 
for he had stretched himself on his bed of leaver, and 
was in a fair way to forget the trials and hardships 
of the voyage in the deep sleep which makes it " all 
night ' with a tired boy. 

After Ben was thoroughly dried and warmed, he 
planed himself by the side of his fellow-voyager, and 
both journeyed together through the quiet shiules of 
dreamland, leaving no wakeful eye to watch over the 
interests of the expedition while they slumbered. 




CHAPTER V. 

ri» WHICH HARKY FIOHTS A HARD BATTLE, AND 
IS DEFEATED. 

The sun was high in the heavens when the tired 
boatmen awoke. Unaccustomed as they were to 
fatigue and late hours, they had been completely 
overcome by the exertion and exposure of the pre- 
vious night. Harry was the first to recover his lost 
senses; and when he opened his eyes, every thing 
looked odd and strange to him. It was not the 
rough, but neat and comfortable little room in the 
poorhouse which greeted his dawning consciousness : 
it was the old forest and the dashing river. He 
did not feel quite at home ; the affair had been di- 
gested of its air of romance, and he felt more like a 
runaway boy than the hero of a fairy tale. 

" Hallo, BeD ' " shouted he, to his sleeping com 
panion. 





Ben growled once, and then rolled over, as if angrj 
at being disturbed. 

" Ben ! We shall be caught, if you don't wake 
up. There, the clock is striking eight ! " and to give 
P>en a better idea of where he was, he administered 
a smart kick in the region of the ribs. 

" What are you about ? " snarled Ben, springing 
to his feet with clinched fists. 

" Time we were moving. Don't you see how higt 
the sun is ? The clock has just struck eight." 

" No matter for that. We are just as safe here as 
any where else. You kick me again, and see where 
you will be ! " 

" Cor.<e, come, Ben ; don't get mad." 

" Don't kick me, then." 

" What are you going to do now ? " 

" That's my business. You do what I tell you , 
that's all you have to do with it," replied Ben, im« 
periously, as he walked to the bank of the river to 
purvey the difficulties of the navigation. 

" Is it ? " asked Harry, not particularly pleased 
with this interpretation of their relations. 

" You better believe it ii." 



 

" I don't believe any thing of the kind. I ain't 
your nigger, any how ! " added Harry, with spirit. 

" I'll bet yju are." 

" I'll bet I ain't." 

" What are you going to do about it ? " 

" I'll let you know what I am going to do." 

" If you don't mind what I tell you, I'll wallo 
vou on the spot." 

" No, you wont ; " and Harry turned on his heel, 
and leisurely walked off towards the thickest of tha 
forest. 

" Where are you going ? " 

" Off." 

" Off where ? " 

" Do you think I'm going to stay with you, to be 
treated like a dog ! " replied Harry, as he continued 
his letreat. 

Ben started after him, but Harry picked up a stick 
of wood and stood on the defensive. 

" Now, if you don't come back, I'll break you: 
head ! " said Ben. 

" Look out that your own don't get broke ; " and 
Harry brandished his cudgel in the air. 






Ben glanced at the club, and saw from the flash o^ 
Harry's bright eye, that he was thoroughly amused 
His companion v.ds not to be trifled with, and he 
was read) to abandon the point. 

" Come, Harry, it's no use for us to quarrel," he 
added, with a forced smile. 

" I know that ; but I won't be trod upon by you, 
m} booN else." 
' I don't want to tread on you." 

''Yes, you do; you needn't think you are going 
to lord it over me in that way. I will go back to 
the poorhouse first." 

" Let's be friends again, Harry. Throw down 
your club." 

" Yes, and let you lick me then ! No, you don't ! " 

" I won't touch you, Harry ; upon my word and 
honor, I won't." 

" Humph ! Your word and honor ain't worth 
much. I'll go back, if you'll behave yourself; but 
I shall keep the club handy." 

" Any way you like ; but let us be off." 

Ben changed his tone, and condescended to tell 
Harry what he meant to do, even at the sacrifice of



his dignity as commander of the expedition. An 
appearance at least of good feeling was restored, and 
after breakfasting on their bread and cheese, they 
embarked again, on what now promised to be a peril- 
ous voyage. 

For a quarter of a mile below, the bed of the nar- 
row river was spotted with rocks, among which the 
water dashed with a fury that threatened the destruc- 
tion of their frail bark. For a time they seriously 
debated the question of abandoning the project, Har- 
ry proposing to penetrate the woods in a north-east- 
erly direction. Ben, however, could not abandon the 
prospect of sailing leisurely down the river when 
they had passed the rapids, making the»passage with- 
out any exertion. He was not pleased with the idea 
of trudging along on foot for thirty miles, v>hen the 
river would bear them to the city with only a little 
difficulty occasionally at the rapids and snoal places. 
Pei haps his plan would have been practicable at the 
highest stage of water, but the river w; s now below 

ts ordinary level. 
Hen's love of an easy and 'om^ntr  time carried 

he duy, and Harry's practical common sense reason' 





ing was of no avail, and a taunt at his cowardice 
induced him to yield the point. 

" Now, Harry, you take one of the paddles, and 
place yourself in the bow, while I steer," said Ben, 
as he assumed his position. 

" Very well ; you shall be captain of the boat, and 
I will do just as you say ; but I won't be bullied on 
ghore," replied Harry, taking the station assigned 
him. 

" All right ; now cast off the painter, and let hei 
slide. Keep both eyes open." 

" Never fear me ; I will do my share." 

The boat floated out into the current, and was 
borne rapidly down the swift-flowing stream. They 
were not very skilful boatmen, and it was more a 
matter of tact than of strength to keep the boat from 
dashing on the sharp rocks. For a little way, they 
did very well, though the passage was sufficiently ex- 
citing to call their powers into action, and to suggest 
doubt as to the ultimate result of the venture. 

They soon reached a place, however, where the? 
river turned a sharp angle, and the waters were furi- 
ously precipitated down upon a bed of rocks, which 
threatened them with instant destruction. 




" We shall be smashed to pieces ! " exclaimed the 
foolhardy pilot, as his eye measured the descent or 
the waters. " Let's try to get ashore." 

" Too late now," replied Harry, coolly. " Put he 
through, hit or miss." 

But Ben's courage all oozed out, in the face of this 
imminent peril, and he made a vain attempt to push 
the boat towards the shore. 

" Paddle your end round, Harry," gasped Ben, in 
the extremity of fear. " We shall be smashed to 
pieces." 

" Too late, Ben ; stand stiff, and make the best of 
it," answered Harry, as he braced himself to meet 
the shock. 

The rushing waters bore the boat down the stream 
in spite of the feeble efforts of the pilot to check he? 
progress. Ben seemed to have lost all his self-pos- 
session, and stooped down, holding on with both 
hands at the gunwale. 

Down she went into the boiling caldron of water
roaring and foaming like a little Niagara. One hara 
bump on the sharp rocks, and Harry heard the boards 
snap under him. He waited for no more, bu' grasp- 




ing the overhanging branches of a willow, which grew 
on the bank, and upon which he had before fixed his 
eyes as the means of rescuing himself, he sprang up 
into the tree, and saw Ben tumbled from the boat 
into the seething caldron. 

" Save me, Harry ! " shouted Ben. 

But Harry had to save himself first, which, how- 
ever, was not now a difficult matter. Swinging him- 
self from branch to branch till he reached the trunk 
of the willow, he descended to the ground, without 
having even wet the soles of his shoes. 

" Save me ! save me!" cried Ben, in piteous ac- 
cents, as the current bore him down the stream. 

" Hold on to the boat," replied Harry, "and I will 
be there in a minute." 

Seizing a long pole which had some time formed 
part of a fence there, he hastened down the bank to 
the water's edge. The water was not very deep, 
but it ran so rapidly that Ben could neither swim 
nor stand upon the bottom ; and but for his compan- 
ion's promptness, he would undoubtedly have been 
drowned. Grasping the long pole which Harry ex< 
tended to him, he was drawn to the shore, having 




received no other injury than a terrible fright and a 
good ducking. 

" Here we are," said Harry, when his companion 
was safely landed. 

"Yes, here we are," growled Ben; "and it is all 
your fault that we are here." 

" It is my fault that you are here ; for if I had not 
pulled you out of the river, you would have been 
drowned," replied Harry, indignantly ; and perhaps 
he felt a little sorry just then that he had rescued 
his ungrateful commander. 

" Yes, and if you had only done as I told you, and 
pushed for the shore above the fall, all this would not 
have happened." 

"And if you hadn't been a fool, we should nit 
have tried to go through such a hole. There goes 
your old boat;" and Harry pointed to the wreck, 
filled with water, floating down the stream. 

" Here they are ! " shouted a voice, not far from 
them. 

Harry started, and so did Ben. 

" We are caught ! " exclaimed Ben. 

"No" yet," replied Harry, with some trepidation* 





as fie broke off a piece of the pole that lay at his feet, 
and retreated from the river. " Take a club, for I 
am not going to be carried back without fighting 
for  it." 

A survey of the ground and of the pursuers ena- 
bled him to prepare for the future. He discovered 
at a glance the weakness of the assailants. 

" Take a club, Ben. Don't you see there is only 
one man on this side of the river ? and we can easily 
beat him off." 

Ben took the club ; but he seemed not to have the 
energy to use it. In fact, Harry showed himself bet- 
ter qualified to manage the present interests of the 
expedition than his companion. . All at once he de- 
veloped the attributes of a skilful commander, while 
his confederate seemed to have lost all his cunning 
and all his determination. 

" Now, let us run ; and if we are caught we wiU 
fcght for it," said Harry. 

'lhi boys took to their heels, and having a fail start 
of their pursuer, they kept clear of him for a con- 
siderable distance ; but Ben's wet clothes impeded 
his progress, and Harry had too much magnanimity 
to save himself at the sacrifice of his companion. 



 

It was evident, after the chase had continued a short 
time, that their pursuer was gaining upon them. In 
rain Harry urged Ben to increase his speed ; his 
pn gress was very slow, and it was soon apparent to 
Hairy that they were wasting their breath in running 
when they would need it for the fight. 

" Now, Ben, we can easily whip this man, and save 
ourselves. Be a man, and let us stand by each other 
to the last." 

Ben made no reply ; but when Harry stopped, he 
did the same. 

"Keep off! or we will knock your brains out," 
crk'd Harry, placing himself in the attitude of defence 

But the man took no notice of this piece of brava- 
do ; and, as he approached, Harry levelled a blow at 
his head. The man warded it off, and sprang forward 
to grasp the little rebel. 

" Hit him, Ben ! " shouted Harry, as he dodged 
the swoop of his assailant. 

To his intense indignation and disgust, Ben, instead 
of seconding his assault, dropped his club, and fled. 
lie seemed to run a good deal faster than he had run 
before that day ; but Harry did not give up the point 




The man pressed him closely, and he defended ninif 
self with a skill and vigor worthy a better cause 
Hut it war of no use ; or, if it was, it only gave Ben 
men time to effect his escape. 

The unequal contest, however, soon termirated in 
the capture of our resolute hero, and the man tied 
his hands behind his back ; but he did not dare to 
.'eave the young lion to go in pursuit of his less un- 
fortunate, but more guilty, confederate. 

" There, Master Harry West, I think you have got 
into a tight place now," said his captor, whose name 
was Nathan Leman, brother of the person to whom 
the boat belonged. " We will soon put you in a 
place where you won't burn any more barns." 

Harry was confounded at this charge, and promptly 
and indignantly denied it. He had not considered 
the possibility of being accused of such a crime, and 
it seemed to put a new aspect upon his case. 

" You did not set fire to Squire Walker's barn last 
night ? " replied Leman, incredulously. 

" No, I did not." 

" Pei haps you can make ^he squire believe it,* 
sneered his captor. 




" I didn't do it." 

" Didn't steal my brother's boat either, did you?" 

"I  didn't." 

" Who did ? " 

Harry thought a moment. After the mean trick 
which Ben Smart had served him, he did not feel 
very kindly towards him, but he was not yet prepared 
to betray him. 

" I didn't," was his reply. 

Nathan Leman then conducted his prisoner to the 
river's side. By this time the other pursuer, who 
had been obliged to ascend the river for a quarter of 
a mile before he could cross, joined him. 

" Where is the other fellow ? " he asked. 

" Couldn't catch him. This one fought like a 
young tiger, and I couldn't leave him," replied Na- 
than. " If you will take Harry up to the village, \ 
will soon have him." 

The other assented, and while Nathan wont in 
eearch of Ben, Harry was conducted back to ihe 
village. 

The prisoner was sad and depressed in spirits; but 
tie did not lose all hope. He was appalled at the 




idea of being accused of burning tbe barn ; but Le 
was innocent, and had a vague assurance tbat no 
harm could befall him on that account. 

When they entered the village, a crowd gathered 
around them, eager to learn the particulars of the 
capture ; but without pausing to gratify this curiosi- 
ty, Harry's conductor lrd him to the poor house, and 
placed bim in charge of Mr. Naaon. 




 

The keeper of the poorhouse received Harry in 
sullen silence, and conducted him to the chamber in 
which he had been ordered to keep him a close 
prisoner. He had apparently lost all confidence in 
him, and regretted that he had connived at his 
escape. 

Harry did not like the cold and repulsive deport- 
ment of his late friend. Mr. Nason had always been 
kind to him ; now he seemed to have fallen in with 
Squire Walker's plans, and was willing to be the 
instrument of the overseer's narrow and cruel policy. 
Before, he had taken his part against the mighty, so 
far as it was prudent for him to do so ; now, he was 
willing to go over to the enemy. 

This reverse made him sadder than any other circumstance of his return — sadder than the fear of 
punishment, or even of being sent to live with Jacob 
Wire. 

"I've get back again," said Harry, when they 
reached the chamber in which he was to be confined. 

" I see you have," replied Mr. Nason, in freezing 
tones. 

The keeper had never spoken to him in high
tones, and Harry burst into tears. His only riend 
had deserted him, and he felt more desolate than 
ever before in his life. 

" You needn't cry, now," said Mr. Nason, sternly. 

" I can't help it," sobbed the little prisoner. 

*' Can't you ? " 

Mr. Nason sneered as he spoke, and his sreer 
pierced the heart of Harry. 

" O Mr. Nason ! " 

" There — that will do. You needn't bL.bbcr any 
aiore. You have n.ade jvur bed, fad now you ran 
lie in it ; " and the keeper turned on his heel to 
eave the room. 

" Don't leave me yet," pleaded Harry. 

" Leave you ? What do you want of me ? I 



t 

luppose you want to tell me I advised you to burn 
the barn." 

"I didn't set the barn afire !" exclaimed Harry, 
now for the first time realizing the cause of his 
friend's displeasure. 

" Don't lie." 

" I speak the truth. I did not set it afire, or even 
know that it was going to be set on fire." 

Mr. Nason closed the door which he had opened 
to depart. The firm denial, as well as the tone and 
manner of the boy, arrested his judgment against 
him. He had learned to place implicit confidence in 
Harry's word ; for though he might have told lies 
to others, he never told them to him. 

" Who did burn the barn r " asked the keeper, 
locking sternly into the eye of the culprit. 

Harry hesitated. A sense of honor and magna- 
nimity pervaded his soul. He had obtained some 
f:ilse notions ; and he did not understand that he 
could hardly be false to one who had been false to 
himself — that to help a criminal conceal his cr'*ne 
was to onspire against the peace and happiness of 
his fellow-beings. Shabbily as lien Smart had used 




him, he could not at once make up his mind to be
ray him. 

" You don't answer," added Mr. Nason. 

" I didn't do it." 

" Rut who did ? " 

" I don't like to tell." 

" Very well ; you can do as you like. After what 
I had done for you, it was a little strange that you 
should do as you have." 

" I will tell you all about it, Mr. Nason, if you 
will promise not to tell." 

" I know all about it. You and I be Smart put 
your heads together to be revenged on the squire ; 
you set his barn afire, and then stole Leman's beat." 

" No, sir ; I didn't set the barn afire, nor steal 
the boat, nor help to do either." 

" You and he were together." 

' We were ; and if it wasn't for being mean to 
lien, I would tell you all about it." 

" Mean to Ben ! As soon as it was known that 
you and Ben were missing, every body in the village 
knew who set the barn afire. All you have got to 
do is to clear yourself, if you can ; Ben is condemned 
already." 



 

*' If you will hear my story I will tell you all 
ab)ut it." 

Harry proceeded to narrate every thing that had 
occurred since he left the house on the preceding 
night. It was a very clear and plausible statement. 
He ans vcred all the questions which Mr Nason pro- 
posed with promptness, and his replies were con- 
nistent. 

" I believe you, Harry," said the keeper, when he 
had finished his examination. " Somehow I couldn't 
believe you would do such a thing as set the squire's 
barn afire." 

" I wouldn't," replied Harry, warmly, and much 
pleased to find he had reestablished the confidence of 
his friend. 

" But it is a bad case. The fact of your being 
with Ben Smart is almost enough to convict you." 

" I shouldn't have been with him, if I had known 
be set the barn afire." 

" I don't know as I can dc any thing for you, 
Harry ; but I will try." 

" Thank you." 

Mr. Nason left him, and Harry had an opportunity 




to consider the desperate circumstances of his pos: 
tiun. It looked just as though he should he sen' 
to the house of correction, But he was innocent. 
Ue felt his innocence; as he expressed it to the 
deeper afterwards, he " felt it in his hones." It did 
not, on further consideration, seem prohable that he 
would be punished for doing what he had not done, 
either as principal or accessory. A vague idea of 
an all-pervading justice consoled him; and he soon 
reasoned himself into a firm assurance that he should 
escape unharmed. 

He was in the mood for reasoning ju'.t then — 
perhaps because he had nothing better to do, or per- 
haps because the added experience of the last twenty- 
four hours enabled him to reason better than before. 
His fine scheme of getting to Boston, and there 
making a rich and great man of himself, had signaliy 
failed. He did not give it up, however. 

" I have failed once, but I will try again," said he 
to himself, as the conclusion of the whole matter; 
»n I he picked up an old school book which lay on 
the tahle. 

The book contained a story, which he had often 



 

tead, aloat a man who had met with a long list of 
misfortunes, as he deemed them when they occurred 
but which proved to be blessings in disguise. 

" Oft from apparent ills our blessings rise. 
Act well your part ; there all the honor lies." 

This couplet from the school books came to his aid, 
also ; and he proceeded to make an application of 
this wisdom to his own mishaps. 

" Suppose I had gone on with Ben. He is a mis- 
erable fellow," thought Harry ; " he would bave led 
me into all manner of wickedness. I ought not to 
have gone with him, or had any thing to do with 
him. He might have made a thief and a robber of 
me. I know I ain't any better than I should be ; 
but I don't believe I'm as bad as he is. At any 
rate, I wouldn't set a barn afire. It is all for the 
best, just as the parson says when any body dies 
By this scrape I have got clear of Ben, and learned 
a lesson that I won't forget in a hurry." 

Uarry was satisfied with this logic, and really 
believed that something which an older and more 
devout person would have regarded as a special 





providence had interposed to save him from a life 
of infamy and wickedness. It was a blessed experi- 
ence, and his thoughts were very serious and earnest. 

In the afternoon, Squire Walker came down to 
the pcorhouse to subject Harry to a preliminary ex- 
amination. Ben Smart had not been taken, and the 
pursuers had abandoned the chase. 

" Boy," said the squire, when Harry was brought 
before him ; " look at me." 

Harry looked at the overseer with all his might. 
He had got far enough to despise the haughty little 
great man. A taste of freedom had enlarged his 
ideas and developed his native independence, so tbat 
he did not quail, as the squire intended he should ; 
on the contrary, his eyes snapped with the earnest- 
ness of his gaze. With an honest and just man, hia 
unflinching eye would have been good evidence in 
his favor ; but the pompous overseer wished to aiva 
him, rather than get at the simple truth. 

" You set my barn on fire," continued the squire. 

" T did not," replied Harry, firmly. 

" Yes, you did. How dare you deny it ? " 

« I did not." 




He had often read, and heard read, that passage 
of Scriptuie which says, " Let your communications 
he Yea, yea, Nay, nay ; for whatsoever is more than 
these cometh of evil."' Just then he felt the truth 
of the inspired axiom. It seemed just as though any 
amount of violent protestations would not help him ; 
and though the squire repeated the charge half a 
dozen times, he only replied with his firm and simple 
denial. 

Then Squire "Walker called his hired man, upon 
whose evidence he depended for the conviction of 
the little incendiary. 

" Is that the hoy, John ? " asked the squire, point- 
ing to Harry. 

" No, sir ; it was a bigger boy than that," replied 
John, without hesitation. 

" Are you sure ? " 

" O, very sure." 

" It must be that this is the boy," persisted the 
vquire, evidently much disappointed by the testimony 
of the man. 

" I am certain it was a bigger boy than this." 

" I feel pretty clear about it, Mr. Nason," added 

the squire. " You see, tiiis boy was mad, yesterday, 
because i wanted to send him to Jacob Wire's. My 
barn is burned, and it stands to reason he burned it," 

" But I saw the boy round the barn night afore 
last," interposed John, who was certainly better 
qualified to be a justice of the peace han his em- 
ployer. 

"I know that; but the barn wasn't burned till 
last night." 

" But Harry couldn't have had any grudge against 
you night before last," said Mr. Xason. 

" I don't know about that," mused the squire, who 
was apparently trying to reconcile the facts to hia 
theorj , rather than the theory to the facts. 

John, the hired man, lived about three miles from 
the squire's house. His father was very sick ; and 
he had been home every evening for a week, return- 
ing between ten and eleven. On the night preceding 
the fire, he had seen a boy prowling round the barn, 
who ran away at his approach. The next day, he 
found a pile of withered grass, dry sticks, and other 
rombustibles heaped against a loose board in the side 
of the barn. He had informed the squire of the




facts , but the worthy justice did not consider them 
of much moment. 

Probably Ben had intended to burn the barn tlmn, 
tut had been prevented from executing his purpose 
by the approach of the hired man. 

"This must be the boy," added the squire. 

" he had on a sack coat, and was bigger than this 
boy," replied John. 

" Harry has no sack coat," put in Mr. Xason, 
eagerly catching at this evidence. 

" It is easy to be mistaken in the night. Search 
him, and see if there are any matches about him." 

Undoubtedly this was a very brilliant suggestion 
of the squire's muddy intellect — as though every 
man who carried matches was necessarily an incen- 
diary. Rut no matches were found upon Harry ; 
and, according to the intelligent justice's perception 
of the nature of evidence, the suspected party should 
nave been acquitted. 

No matches were found on Harry; but in his 
acket pocket, carefully enclosed in a piece of brown 
paper, «*cre found the four quarters of a doilar ?iveu 
to him by Mr. Nason. 





"Where did you get those?" asked the squire, 
iternly. 

"They Were given to me," replied Harry. 

Mr. Nason averted his eyes, and was very uneasy. 
The fact of having given this money to Harry went 
to show that he had been privy to his escape ; and 
his kind act seemed to threaten him with ruin. 

" Who gave them to you ? " 

Harry made no reply. 

" Answer me," thundered the squire. 

" I shall not tell," replied Harry. 

" You shall not ? " 

" No, sir." 

The squire was nonplussed. The boy was as firm 
as a hero ; and no threats could induce him to betray 
his kind friend, whose position he fully compre- 
hended. 

" We will see," roared the squire. 

Several persons who had been present during the 
examination, and who were satisfied that Harry was 
innocent of the crime charged upon him, interfered 
to save him from the consequences of thf squ-re's 
wrath. 




Mr. Xason, finding that his young friend was 
likely to suffer for his magnanimity, explained the 
matter — thus turning the squire's anger 'rom the 
toy to himself. 

"So you helped the boy run away — did you ? *' 
said the overseer. 

" He did not ; he told me that money would keep 
me from starving." 

" Did he ? " 

Those present understood the allusion, and the 
squire did not press the matter any further. In the 
course of the examination, Ben Smart had often been 
alluded to, and the crime was fastened upon him. 
Harry told his story, which, confirmed by the evi- 
dence of the hired man, was fully credited by all 
except the squire, who had conceived a violent an- 
tipathy to the boy. 

The examination was informal ; the squire did nol 
hold it as a justice of the peace, but only as a citi- 
zen, or, at most, as an overseer of the poor. How- 
ever, it proved thut, as the burning of the barn had 
Deen planned before any difficulty had occurred be- 

twccn the squire and Hair)', he had no mothe for  

doing the deed. 

The squire was not satisfied : hut the worst he 

could do was to commit Harry to the care of Jacob 
Wire, which was immediately done. 

" I am sorry for you, Harry," whispered Mr. 
Nason. 

"Never mind; I shall fry again" he repl'.d, ae 
he jumped into the wagon with his persecutor. 




CHAPTER VII. 


" Jacob, here is the boy," said Squire Walker, as 
he stopped his horse in front of an old, decayed 
house.
