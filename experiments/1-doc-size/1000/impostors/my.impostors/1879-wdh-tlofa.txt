with the breakfast on a tray, and Mrs. Erwin added, 
" Now, pull up that little table, and bring your 
chair, my dear, and let us take it easy. I like to 
talk while I 'm breakfasting. Will you pour out my 
chocolate ? That 's it, in the ugly little pot with 
the wooden handle ; the copper one 's for you, with 
coffee in it. I never could get that repose which 
seems to come perfectly natural to you. I was 
always inclined to be a little rowdy, my dear, and 
I 've had to fight hard against it, without any help 
from either of my husbands ; men like it ; they 
think it 's funny. When I was first married, I was 
very young, and so was he; it was a real love 
match ; and my husband was very well off, and 
when I began to be delicate, nothing would do but 
he must come to Europe with me. How little I 
ever expected to outlive him ! " 

" You don't look very sick now," began Lydia. 

" I am," said her aunt. " You must say ill. Sick 
is an Americanism." 

" It 's in the Bible," said Lydia, gravely. 

" Oh, there are a great many words in the Bible 
you can't use," returned her aunt. " No, I don't 
look ill now, and I 'm worlds better. But I 



 

couldn 't live a year in any other climate, I suppose. 
You seem to take after your mother's side. Well, 
as I was saying, the European ways didn't come 
natural to me, at all. I used to have a great deal 
of gayety when I was a girl, and I liked beaux and 
attentions : and I had very free ways. I couldn 't 
get their stiffness here for years and years, and all 
through my widowhood it was one wretched failure 
with me. Do what I would, T was always violat- 
ing the most essential rules, and the worst of it was 
that it only seemed to make me the more popular. 
I do believe it was nothing but my rowdiness that 
attracted Mr. Erwin ; but I determined when I had 
got an Englishman I would make one bold strike 
for the proprieties, and have them, or die in the 
attempt. I determined that no Englishwoman I 
ever saw should outdo me in strict conformity to 
all the usages of European society. So I cut my- 
self off from all the Americans, and went with no- 
body but the English." 

" Do you like them better ? " asked Lydia, with 
the blunt, child-like directness that had already 
more than once startled her aunt. 

"Like them! I detest them! If Mr. Erwin 
were a real Englishman, I think I should go crazy ; 
but he 's been so little in his own country — all his 
life in India, nearly, and the rest on the Continent, 
— that he's quite human; and no American hus- 
band was ever more patient and indulgent; and 
that J  saying a good deal. He would be glad to 



 

have nothing but Americans around ; he has an en- 
thusiasm for them, — or for what he supposes they 
are. Like the English ! You ought to have heard 
them during our war ; it would have made your 
blood boil ! And then how they came crawling 
round after it was all over, and trying to pet us 
up ! Ugh ! " 

" If you feel so about them," said Lydia, as be- 
fore, "why do you want to go with them so 
much ? " 

" My dear," cried her aunt, " to heat them with 
their own iveapons on their own ground, — to show 
them that an American can be more European than 
any of them, if she chooses ! And now you 've 
come here with looks and temperament and every- 
thing just to my hand. You 're more beautiful 
than any English girl ever dreamt of being ; you 're 
very distinguished-looking ; your voice is perfectly 
divine ; and you 're colder than an iceberg. Oh, 
if I only had one winter with you in Rome, I think 
I should die in peace ! " Mrs. Erwin paused, and 
drank her chocolate, which she had been letting 
cool in the eagerness of her discourse. " But, never 
mind," she continued, " we will do the best we can 
here. I 've seen English girls going out two or 
three together, without protection, in Rome and 
Florence ; but I mean that you shall be quite 
Italian in that respect. The Italians never go out 
without a chaperone of some sort, and you must 
never be seen without me, or your uncle, or 



 

Veronica. Now I 'll tell you how you must do at 
parties, and so on. You must be very retiring ; 
you 're that, any way ; but you must always keep 
close to me. It doesn 't do for young people to 
talk much together in society ; it makes scandal 
about a girl. If you dance, you must always hurry 
back to me. Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Erwiu, 
"I remember how, when I was a girl, I used to 
hang on to the young men's arms, and promenade 
with them after a dance, and go out to supper with 
them, and flirt on the stairs, — such times ! But 
that wouldn 't do here, Lydia. It would ruin a 
girl's reputation ; she could hardly walk arm in 
arm with a young man if she was engaged to him." 
Lydia blushed darkly red, and then turned paler 
than usual, while her aunt went on. " You might 
do it, perhaps, and have it set down to American 
eccentricity or under-breeding, but I 'm not going 
to have that. I intend you to be just as dull and 
diffident in society as if you were an Italian, and 
more than if you were English. Your voice, of 
course, is a difficulty. If you sing, that will make 
you conspicuous, in spite of everything. But I 
don't see why that can't be turned to advantage ; 
it 's no worse than your beauty. Yes, if you 're 
so splendid-looking and so gifted, and at the same 
time as stupid as the rest, it 's so much clear gain. 
It will come easy for you to be shy with men, for I 
suppose you 've hardly ever talked with any, living 
up there in that out-of-the-way village ; and your 



 

manner is very good. It 's reserved, and yet it 
isn 't green. The way," continued Mrs. Erwin, 
" to treat men in Europe is to behave as if they 
were guilty till they prove themselves innocent. 
All you have to do is to reverse all your American 
ideas. But here I am, lecturing you as if you had 
been just such a girl as I was, with half a dozen 
love affairs on her hands at once, and no end of 
gentlemen friends. Europe won't be hard for you, 
my dear, for you haven 't got anything to unlearn. 
But some girls that come over! — it's perfectly 
ridiculous, the trouble they get into, and the time 
they have getting things straight. They take it for 
granted that men in good society are gentlemen, — 
what we mean by gentlemen." 

Lydia had been letting her coffee stand, and had 
scarcely tasted the delicious French bread and the 
sweet Lombard butter of which her aunt ate so 
heartily. " Why, child," said Mrs. Erwin, at last, 
" where is your appetite? One would think you 
were the elderly invalid who had been up late. 
Did you find it too exciting to sit at home looking 
at a novel ? What was it ? If it 's a new story I 
should like to see it. But you didn 't bring a novel 
from South Bradfield with you? " 

" No," said Lydia, with a husky reluctance. " One 
of the — passengers gave it to me." 

" Had you many passengers ? But of course not. 
That was what made it so delightful when I came 
over that way. I was newly married then, and 



 

with spirits — oh dear me ! — for anything. It was 
one adventure, the whole way ; and we got so well 
acquainted, it was like one family. I suppose your 
grandfather put you in charge of some family. I 
know artists sometimes come out that way, and 
people for their health." 

" There was no family on our ship," said Lydia. 
" My state-room had been fixed up for the captain's 
wife " — 

" Our captain's wife was along, too," interposed 
Mrs. Erwin. " She was such a joke with us. She 
had been out to Venice on a voyage before, and 
used to be always talking about the Du-cal Palace. 
And did they really turn out of their state-room 
for you ? " 

" She was not along," said Lydia. 

" Not along ? " repeated Mrs. Erwin, feebly. 
" Who — who were the other passengers ? " 

" There were three gentlemen," answered Lydia. 

" Three gentlemen ? Three men? Three — And 
you — and " — Mrs. Erwin fell back upon her pil- 
low, and remained gazing at Lydia, with a sort of 
remote bewildered pity, as at perdition, not indeed 
beyond compassion, but far beyond help. Lydia's 
color had been coming and going, but now it settled 
to a clear white. Mrs. Erwin commanded herself 
sufficiently to resume : u And there were — there 
were — no other ladies ? " 

"No." 

" And you were " — 



 

" I was the only woman on board," replied Lydia. 
She rose abruptly, striking the edge of the table in 
her movement, and setting its china and silver jar- 
ring. " Oh, I know what you mean, aunt Jose- 
phine, but two days ago I couldn 't have dreamt it ! 
From the time the ship sailed till I reached this 
wicked place, there wasn 't a word said nor a look 
looked to make me think I wasn't just as right and 
safe there as if I had been in my own room at 
home. They were never anything but kind and 
good to me. They never let me think that they 
could be my enemies, or that I must suspect them 
and be on the watch against them. They were 
Americans ! I had to wait for one of your Eu- 
ropeans to teach me that, — for that officer who was 
here yesterday " — 

" The cavaliere ? Why, where " — 

" He spoke to me in the cars, when Mr. Erwin 
was asleep ! Had he any right to do so ? " 

" He would think he had, if he thought you were 
alone," said Mrs. Erwin, plaintively. " I don't see 
how we could resent it. It was simply a mistake 
on his part. And now you see, Lydia " — 

" Oh, I see how my coming the way I have will 
seem to all these people ! " cried Lydia, with pas- 
sionate despair. " I know how it will seem to that 
married woman who lets a man be in love with her, 
and that old woman who can't live with her hus- 
band because he 's too good and kind, and that girl 
who swears and doesn 't know who her father is, 



 

and that impudent painter, and that officer who 
thinks he has the right to insult women if he finds 
them alone ! I wonder the sea doesn 't swallow up 
a place where even Americans go to the theatre on 
the Sabbath!" 

" Lydia, Lydia ! It isn 't so bad as it seems to 
you," pleaded her aunt, thrown upon the defensive 
by the girl's outburst. " There are ever so many 
good and nice people in Venice, and I know them, 
too, — Italians as well as foreigners. And even 
amongst those you saw, Miss Landini is one of the 
kindest girls in the world, and she had just been to 
see her old teacher when we met her, — she half 
takes care of him ; and Lady Fenleigh 's a perfect 
mother to the poor ; and I never was at the Count- 
ess Tatocka's except in the most distant way, at a 
ball where everybody went ; and is it better to let 
your uncle go to the opera alone, or to go with 
him ? You told me to go with him yourself ; and 
they consider Sunday over, on the Continent, after 
morning service, any way ! " 

" Oh, it makes no difference ! " retorted Lydia, 
wildly. " I am going away. I am going home. I 
have money enough to get to Trieste, and the ship 
is there, and Captain Jenness will take me back 
with him. Oh ! " she moaned. " He has been in 
Europe, too, and I suppose he 's like the rest of 
you ; and he thought because I was alone and help- 
less he had the right to — Oh, I see it, I see now 
that he never meant anything, and — Oh, oh, oh ! " 



 

She fell on her knees beside the bed, as if crushed 
to them by the cruel doubt that suddenly over- 
whelmed her, and flung out her arms on Mrs. Er- 
win's coverlet — it was of Venetian lace sewed 
upon silk, a choice bit from the palace of one of 
the ducal families — and buried her face in it. 

Her aunt rose from her pillow, and looked in 
wonder and trouble at the beautiful fallen head, 
and the fair young figure shaken with sobs. " He 
— who — what are you talking about, Lydia ? 
Whom do you mean ? Did Captain Jenness " — 

" No, no ! " wailed the girl, " the one that gave 
me the book." 

" The one that gave you the book ? The book 
you were looking at last night? " 

" Yes," sobbed Lydia, with her voice muffled in 
the coverlet. 

Mrs. Erwin lay down again with significant de- 
liberation. Her face was still full of trouble, but 
of bewilderment no longer. In moments of great 
distress the female mind is apt to lay hold of some 
minor anxiety for its distraction, and to find a cer- 
tain relief in it. " Lydia," said her aunt in a 
broken voice, " I wish you wouldn 't cry in the cov- 
erlet : it doesn 't hurt the lace, but it stains the 
silk." Lydia swept her handkerchief under her 
face but did not lift it. Her aunt accepted the 
compromise. " How came he to give you the 
book ? " 

" Oh, I don't know. I can't tell. I thought it 



 

was because — because — It was almost at the 
very beginning. And after that he walked up and 
down with me every night, nearly ; and he tried to 
be with me all he could ; and he was always saying 
things to make me think — Oh dear, oh dear, oh 
dear ! And he tried to make me care for him ! Oh, 
it was cruel, cruel! " 

"You mean that he made love to you?" asked 
her aunt. 

" Yes — no — I don't know. He tried to make 
me care for him, and to make me think he cared for 
me." 

"Did he say he cared for you ? Did he " — 

" No ! " 

Mrs. Erwin mused a while before she said, " Yes, 
it was cruel indeed, poor child, and it was cowardly, 
too." 

" Cowardly ? " Lydia lifted her face, and flashed 
a glance of tearful fire at her aunt. " He is the 
bravest man in the world ! And the most generous 
and high-minded ! He jumped into the sea after 
that wicked Mr. Hicks, and saved his life, when he 
disliked him worse than anything ! " 

" Who was Mr. Hicks ? " 

" He was the one that stopped at Messina. He 
was the one that got some brandy at Gibraltar, and 
behaved so dreadfully, and wanted to fight him." 

" Whom ? " 

" This one. The one who gave me the book. 
And don't you see that his being so good makes it 



 

all the worse ? Yes ; and he pretended to be glad 
when I told him I thought he was good, — he got 
me to say it ! " She had her face down again in 
her handkerchief. " And I suppose you think it 
was horrible, too, for me to take his arm, and talk 
and walk with him whenever he asked me ! " 

" No, not for you, Lydia," said her aunt, gently. 
" And don't you think now," she asked after a 
pause, "that he cared for you ? " 

" Oh, I did think so, — I did believe it ; but 
now, now " — 

"Now, what?" 

" Now, I 'm afraid that may be he was only play- 
ing with me, and putting me off ; and pretending 
that he had something to tell me when he got to 
Venice, and he never meant anything by anything." 

" Is he coming to " — her aunt began, but Lydia 
broke vehemently out again. 

"If he had cared for me, why couldn 't he have 
told me so at once, and not had me wait till he got 
to Venice ? He knew I " — 

" There are two ways of explaining it," said Mrs. 
Erwin. " He may have been in earnest, Lydia, and 
felt that he had no right to be more explicit till 
you were in the care of your friends. That would 
be the European way which you consider so bad," 
said Mrs. Erwin. " Under the circumstances, it 
was impossible for him to keep any distance, and 
all he could do was to postpone his declaration till 
there could be something like good form about it. 



 

Yes, it might have been that." She was silent, but 
the troubled look did not leave her face. " I am 
sorry for you, Lydia," she resumed, " but I don't 
know that I wish he was in earnest." Lydia looked 
up at her in dismay. u It might be far less em- 
barrassing the other way, however painful. He 
may not be at all a suitable person." The tears 
stood in Lydia's eyes, and all her face expressed a 
puzzled suspense. " Where was he from ? " asked 
Mrs. Erwin, finally; till then she had been more 
interested in the lover than the man. 

" Boston," mechanically answered Lydia. 

" What was his name ? " 

" Mr. Staniford," owned Lydia, with a blush. 

Her aunt seemed dispirited at the sound. " Yes, 
I know who they are," she sighed. 

" And aren 't they nice ? Isn 't he — suitable ? " 
asked Lydia, tremulously. 

" Oh, poor child ! He 's only too suitable. I 
can't explain to you, Lydia; but at home he 
wouldn't have looked at a girl like you. What 
sort of looking person is he ? " 

" He 's rather — red ; and he has — light hair." 

" It must be the family I 'm thinking of," said 
Mrs. Erwin. She had lived nearly twenty years in 
Europe, and had seldom revisited her native city ; 
but at the sound of a Boston name she was all 
Bostonian again. She rapidly sketched the history 
of the family to which she imagined Staniford to 
belong. " I remember his sister ; I used to see her 



 

at school. She must have been five or six years 
younger than I ; and this boy " — 

" Why, he 's twenty-eight years old ! " inter- 
rupted Lydia. 

"How came he to tell you? " 

" I don't know. He said that he looked thirty- 
four." 

" Yes ; she was always a forward thing too, — 
with her freckles," said Mrs. Erwin, musingly, as 
if lost in reminiscences, not wholly pleasing, of Miss 
Staniford. 

" He has freckles," admitted Lydia. 

"Yes, it's the one," said Mrs. Erwin. " He 
couldn 't have known what your family was from 
anything you said ? " 

" We never talked about our families." 

" Oh, I dare say ! You talked about your- 
selves ? " 

" Yes." 

" All the time ? " 

" Pretty nearly." 

" And he didn 't try to find out who or what you 
were?" 

" He asked a great deal about South Bradfield." 

" Of course, that was where he thought you bad 
always belonged." Mrs. Erwin lay quiescent for a 
while, in apparent uncertainty as to how she should 
next attack the subject. " How did you first 
meet ? " 

Lydia began with the scene on Lucas Wharf, 



 

and little by little told the whole story up to the 
moment of their parting at Trieste. There were 
lapses and pauses in the story, which her aunt was 
never at a loss to fill aright. At the end she said, 
"If it were not for his promising to come here and 
see you, I should say Mr. Staniford had been flirt- 
ing, and as it is he may not regard it as anything 
more than flirtation. Of course, there was his be- 
ing jealous of Mr. Dunham and Mr. Hicks, as he 
certainly was ; and his wanting to explain about 
that lady at Messina — yes, that looked peculiar; 
but he may not have meant anything by it. His 
parting so at Trieste with you, that might be either 
because he was embarrassed at its having got to be 
such a serious thing, or because he really felt badly. 
Lydia," she asked at last, " what made you think 
he cared for you ? " 

" I don't know," said the girl; her voice had sunk 
to a husky whisper. "I didn't believe it till he 
said he wanted me to be his — conscience, and tried 
to make me say he was good, and " — 

" That \s a certain kind of man's way of flirting. 
It may mean nothing at all. I could tell in an 
instant, if I saw him." 

"He said he would be here this afternoon," mur- 
mured Lydia, tremulously. 

" This afternoon ! " cried Mrs. Erwin. " I must 
get up ! " 

At her toilette she had the exaltation and fury 
of a champion arming for battle. 

 



XXV. 

Mb. Enwra entered about the completion of her 
preparations, and without turning round from her 
glass she said, " I want you to think of the worst 
thing you can, Henshaw. I don't see how I 'm ever 
to lift up my head again." As if this word had 
reminded her of her head, she* turned it from side 
to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one 
ear-ring, and then of the other. Her husband 
patiently waited, and she now confronted him. 
" You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, 
and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Noth- 
ing can be done, and you will just have to live 
through it. Lydia — has come over — on that 
ship — alone, — with three young men, — and not 
the shadow — not the ghost — of another woman — 
on board ! " Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her 
hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at 
once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet some- 
how falling short of the due tragic effect. Her 
husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, 
while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put 
the final touches to her personal appearance with 
hands which she had the effect of having desper- 
ately washed of all responsibility. He stood so 
long in this meditative mood that she was obliged 



 

to be peremptory with his image in the glass. 
"Well?" she cried. 

" Why, my dear," said Mr. Erwin, at last, " they 
were all Americans together, you know." 

" And what difference does that make ? " de- 
manded Mrs. Erwin, whirling from bis image to 
the man again. 

" Why, of course, you know, it isn 't as if they 
were — English." Mrs. Erwin flung down three 
hair-pins upon her dressing-case, and visibly de- 
spaired. " Of course you don't expect your coun- 
trymen " — His wife's appearance was here so 
terrible that he desisted, and resumed by saying, 
" Don't be vexed, my dear. I — I rather like it, you 
know. It strikes me as a genuine bit of American 
civilization." 

" American civilization ! Oh, Henshaw ! " wailed 
Mrs. Erwin, " is it possible that after all I 've said, 
and done, and lived, you still think that any one but 
a girl from the greenest little country place could 
do such a thing as that? Well, it is no use trying 
to enlighten English people. You like it, do you ? 
Well, I 'm not sure that the Englishman who mis- 
understands American things and likes them isn 't 
a little worse than the Englishman who misunder- 
stands them and dislikes them. You all misunder- 
stand them. And would you like it, if one of the 
young men had been making love to Lydia ? " 

The amateur of our civilization hesitated and was 
serious, but he said at last, " Why, you know, I 'm 



 

not surprised. She 's so uncommonly pretty. I — I 
suppose they 're engaged ? " he suggested. 

His wife held her peace for scorn. Then she said, 
" The gentleman is of a very good Boston family, 
and would no more think of engaging himself to a 
young girl without the knowledge of her friends 
than you would. Besides, he 's been in Europe a 
great deal." 

" I wish I could meet some Americans who had 
n't been in Europe," said Mr. Erwin. " I should 
like to see what you call the simon-pure American. 
As for the young man's not engaging himself, it 
seems to me that he didn 't avail himself of his na- 
tional privileges. I should certainly have done it in 
his place, if I 'd been an American." 

" Well, if you 'd been an American, you would 
n't," answered his wife. 

" Why ? " 

" Because an American would have had too much 
delicacy." 

" I don't understand that." 

" I know you don't, Henshaw. And there 's 
where you show yourself an Englishman." 

" Really," said her husband, " you 're beginning 
to crow, my dear. Come, I like that a great deal 
better than your cringing .to the effete despotisms 
of the Old World, as your Fourth of July orators 
have it. It 's almost impossible to get a bit of good 
honest bounce out of an American, nowadays, — to 
get him to spread himself, as you say." 



 

" All that is neither here nor there, Henshaw," 
said his wife. " The question is how to receive Mr. 
Stamford — that 's his name — when he comes. How 
are we to regard him ? He 's coming here to see 
Lydia, and she thinks he 's coming to propose." 

" Excuse me, but how does she regard him ? " 

" Oh, there *s no question about that, poor child. 
"She's dead in love with him, and can't understand 
why he didn 't propose on shipboard." 

" And she isn 't an Englishman, either ! " exulted 
Mr. Erwin. u It appears that there are Americans 
and Americans, and that the men of your nation 
have more delicacy than the women like." 

" Don't be silly," said his wife. " Of course, 
women always think what they would do in such 
cases, if they were men ; but if men did what women 
think they would do if they were men, the women 
would be disgusted." 

" Oh ! " 

" Yes. Her feeling in the matter is no guide." 

" Do you know his family? " asked Mr. Erwin. 

" I think I do. Yes, I 'm sure I do." 

" Are they nice people ? " 

" Have 'nt I told you they were a good Boston 
family ? " 

" Then upon my word, I don't see that we 've to 
take any attitude at all. I don't see that we 've to 
regard him in one way or the other. It quite re- 
mains for him to make the first move." 

As if they had been talking of nothing but dress 



 

before, Mrs. Erwin asked : " Do you think I look 
better in this black mexicaine, or would you wear 
your ecru : 

" I think you look very well in this. But why — 
He isn 't going to propose to you, I hope ? " 

" I must have on something decent to receive him 
in. What time does the train from Trieste get 
in?" 

" At three o'clock." 

" It 's one, now. There 's plenty of time, but 
there isn't any too much. I 'll go and get Lydia 
ready. Or perhaps you 'll tap on her door, Henshaw, 
and send her here. Of course, this is the end of her 
voice, — if it is the end." 

" It 's the end of having an extraordinarily pretty 
girl in the house. I don't at all like it, you know, 
— having her whisked away in this manner." 

Mrs. Erwin refused to let her mind wander from 
the main point. " He 'll be round as soon as he can, 
after he arrives. I shall expect him by four, at the 
latest." 

u I fancy he 'll stop for his dinner before he comes," 
said Mr. Erwin. 

" Not at all," retorted his wife, haughtily. And 
with his going out of the room, she set her face in 
a resolute cheerfulness, for the task of heartening 
Lydia when she should appear ; but it only expressed 
misgiving when the girl came in with her yachting- 
dress on. " Why, Lydia, shall you wear that ? " 

Lydia swept her dress with a downward glance. 



 

"I thought I would wear it. I thought he — I 
should seem — more natural in it. I wore it all the 
time on the ship, except Sundays. He said — he 
liked it the best." 

Mrs. Erwin shook her head. " It wouldn 't do. 
Everything must be on a new basis now. He might 
like it ; but it would be too romantic, wouldn 't it, 
don't you think ? " She shook her head still, but 
less decisively. " Better wear your silk. Don't 
you think you 'd better wear your silk ? This 
is very pretty, and the dark blue does become 
you, awfully. Still, I don't know — J don't know, 
either ! A great many English wear those careless 
things in the house. Well, wear it, Lydia ! You 
do look perfectly killing in it. I 'll tell you : your 
uncle was going to ask you to go out in his boat ; 
he 's got one he rows himself, and this is a boating 
costume ; and you know you could time yourselves 
so as to get back just right, and you could come in 
with this on " — 

Lydia turned pale. " Oughtn 't I — oughtn 't I 
— to be here ? " she faltered. 

Her aunt laughed gayly. " Why, he 'll ask for 
me, Lydia." 

« For you ? " asked Lydia, doubtfully. 

" Yes. And I can easily keep him till you get 
back. If you 're here by four " — 

"The train," said Lydia, " arrives at three." 

" How did you know ? " asked her aunt, keenly. 

Lydia's eyelids fell even lower than their wont. 




" I looked it out in that railroad guide in the par- 
lor." 

Her aunt kissed her. " And you 've thought the 
whole thing out, dear, haven 't you ? I 'm glad to 
see you so happy about it." 

" Yes," said the girl, with a fluttering breath, "I 
have thought it out, and I believe him. I " — She 
tried to say something more, but could not. 

Mrs. Erwin rang the bell, and sent for her hus- 
band. " He knows about it, Lydia," she said. 
"He's just as much interested as we are, dear, but 
you needn 't be worried. He 's a perfect post for 
not showing a thing if you don't want him to. 
He 's really quite superhuman, in that, — equal to 
a woman. You can talk Americanisms with him. 
If we sat here staring at each other till four o'clock, 
— he must go to his hotel before he comes here ; 
and I say four at the earliest ; and it 's much more 
likely to be five or six, or perhaps evening, — I 
should die ! " 

Mr. Erwin' s rowing was the wonder of all Ven- 
ice. There was every reason why he should fall 
overboard at each stroke, as he stood to propel the 
boat in the gondolier fashion, except that he never 
yet had done so. It was sometimes his fortune to 
be caught on the shallows by the falling tide ; but 
on that day he safely explored the lagoons, and re- 
turned promptly at four o'clock to the palace. 

His wife was standing on the balcony, looking 
out for them, and she smiled radiantly down into 



 

Lydia's anxiously lifted face. But when she met 
the girl at the head of the staircase in the great 
hall, she embraced her, and said, with the same gay 
smile, " He hasn 't come yet, dear, and of course he 
won't come till after dinner. . If I hadn 't been as 
silly as you are, Lydia, I never should have let you 
expect him sooner. He 'll want to go to his hotel ; 
and no matter how impatient he is, he 'll want to 
dress, and be a little ceremonious about his call. 
You know we 're strangers to him, whatever you 
are." 

" Yes," said Lydia, mechanically. She was going 
to sit down, as she was ; of her own motion she 
would not have stirred from the place till he came, 
or it was certain he would not come ; but her aunt 
would not permit the despair into which she saw 
her sinking. 

She laughed resolutely, and said, " I think we 
must give up the little sentimentality of meeting 
him in that dress, now. Go and change it, Lydia. 
Put on your silk, — or wait : let me go with you. 
I want to try some little effects with your complex- 
ion. We 've experimented with the simple and fa- 
miliar, and now we 'll see what can be done in the 
way of the magnificent and unexpected. I 'm going 
to astonish the young man with a Venetian beauty ; 
you know you look Italian, Lydia." 

" Yes, he said so," answered Lydia. 

" Did he ? That shows he has an eye, and he 'll 
appreciate what we are going to do." 



 

She took Lydia to her own room, for the greater 
convenience of her experiments, and from that mo- 
ment she did not allow her to be alone ; she scarcely 
allowed her to be silent ; she made her talk, she 
kept her in movement. At dinner she permitted no 
lapse. " Henshaw," she said, " Lydia has been tell- 
ing me about a storm they had just before they 
reached Gibraltar. I wish you would tell her of 
the typhoon you were in when you first went out 
to India." Her husband obeyed ; and then recur- 
ring to the days of his civil employment in India, 
he told stories of tiger-hunts, and of the Sepoy 
mutiny. Mrs. Erwin would not let them sit very 
long at table. After dinner she asked Lydia to 
sing, and she suffered her to sing all the American 
songs her uncle asked for. At eight o'clock she 
said with a knowing little look at Lydia, which in- 
cluded a sub-wink for her husband, " You may go 
to your cafe alone, this evening, Henshaw. Lydia 
and I are going to stay at home and talk South 
Bradfield gossip. I ve hardly had a moment with 
her yet." But when he was gone, she took Lydia 
to her own room again, and showed her all her jew- 
elry, and passed the time in making changes in the 
girl's toilette. 

It was like the heroic endeavor of the arctic voy- 
ager who feels the deadly chill in his own veins, and 
keeps himself alive by rousing his comrade from the 
torpor stealing over him. They saw in each other's 
eyes that if they yielded a moment to the doubt in 
their hearts they were lost. 



 

At ten o'clock Mrs. Erwin said abruptly, " Go to 
bed, Lydia ! " Then the girl broke down, and aban- 
doned herself in a storm of tears. " Don't cry, dear, 
don't cry," pleaded her aunt. u He will be here in 
the morning, I know he will. He has been de- 
layed." 

" No, he 's not coming," said Lydia, through her 
sobs. 

" Something has happened," urged Mrs. Erwin. 

" No," said Lydia, as before. Her tears ceased 
as suddenly as they had come. She lifted her head, 
and drying her eyes looked into her aunt's face. 
" Are you ashamed of me ? ' ' she asked hoarsely. 

" Ashamed of you ? Oh, poor child " — 

" I can't pretend anything. If I had never told 
you about it at all, I could have kept it back till I 
died. But now — But you will never hear me 
speak of it again. It 's over." She took up her 
candle, and stiffly suffering the compassionate em- 
brace with which her aunt clung to her, she walked 
across the great hall in the vain splendor in which 
she had been adorned, and shut the door behind 
her. 



XXVI. 

Dunham lay in a stupor for twenty-four hours, 
and after that he was delirious, with dim intervals 
of reason in which they kept him from talking, till 
one morning he woke and looked up at Staniford 
with a perfectly clear eye, and said, as if resuming 
the conservation, " I struck my head on a pile of 
chains." 

" Yes," replied Staniford, with a wan smile, 
u and you 've been out of it pretty near ever since. 
You mustn 't talk." 

" Oh, I 'm all right," said Dunham. u I know 
about my being hurt. I shall be cautious. Have 
you written to Miss Hibbard ? I hope you haven 't ! " 

" Yes, I have," replied Staniford. " But I 
haven 't sent the letter," he added, in answer to 
Dunham's look of distress. " I thought you were 
going to pull through, in spite of the doctor, — he 's 
wanted to bleed you, and I could hardly keep his 
lancet out of you, — and so I wrote, mentioning 
the accident and announcing your complete restora- 
tion. The letter merely needs dating and sealing. 
I 'll look it up and have it posted." He began a 
search in the pockets of his coat, and then went to 
his portfolio. 

" What day is this ? " asked Dunham. 



 

"Friday," said Staniford, rummaging his port- 
folio. 

" Have you been in Venice? " 

" Look here, Dunham ! If you begin in that 
way, I can't talk to you. It shows that you 're still 
out of your head. How could I have been in Ven- 
ice?"
