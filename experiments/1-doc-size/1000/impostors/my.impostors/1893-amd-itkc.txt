trilling their homeward songs, I thought of you." 

" Were we en rapport ? For I have been think- 
ing of you, talking about you. I hope you will 
not consider me officious when you hear " — 

" Yes," cried Stacy, in answer to something 





else. " Come in and have some solid comfort. 
You must all be famished. Aunt Jane's supper 
will be just splendid." 

Pearl lingered, as if waiting for Sabrina to join 
her. The young girl rose, and they walked out 
together. How glad and happy they were ! What 
bits of fun they still tossed to each other, though 
now and then a glance was furtively cast over at 
Miss Eastwood. They were all so at home with 
Pearl, — the young fellows appealed to her; the 
girls claimed her favor; and she seemed in the 
midst of everything, a centre that radiated ways 
of pleasantness in every direction. She looked 
so beautiful just now that Sabrina inwardly pro- 
tested about the waste of her bright loveliness, 
when it could win her so much attention and 
admiration. Was it wasted here ? Was not this 
fresh, eager, whole-hearted preference a thousand 
times sweeter than the carping, critical, languid, 
or envious commendation of the world ? Should 
she wish Pearl a draught of the hollow adulation 
that had so wearied her ? 

"I am completely saturated with worldliness 
myself," she thought, with a pang of condemna- 
tion ; " and the sweetest thing in Pearl is her 
un worldliness." 

Shortly after ten the lights were out and the 
house was still, — a reverent sort of stillness that 





touched Sabrina with the largeness and sacred- 
ness of life. The moon had gone back of the 
great buttonball tree, and all the shadows were 
lengthening ; the stars had come out again in the 
eastern skies. On the other side, what ? At the 
end of life, what ? But must not the doing be 
here and now ? Had she not been gathering 
the shadows and essences of religion in a fra- 
grant service, leaving the real work for others ? 
A verse of the Psalter came to her, " No man 
may make agreement for his brother. It costs 
more to redeem their souls, so he must let that 
alone forever." She must answer for herself. 
She must bring in her own sheaves. Where 
much was given, much was to be required. It 
was as if for the first time she was face to face 
with the greater realities. 

She went to church with Aunt Jane the follow- 
ing morning. Pearl and Stacy walked together. 
It was a very plain sermon ; and its text was, 
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with 
thy might." There was no question, then, about 
loitering. She had found something to do. 

Early Monday morning she wrote to the agent 
that she would keep Chester House, and there 
need be no further anxiety concerning it. Then, 
with Aunt Jane's help, she laid her plans before 
Miss Disbrowe, and they talked it over. 





" You'd want a good, trusty woman to shoulder 
the working end," said Aunt Jane ; " and there's 
Desire White. Only last night she stopped at 
the gate, and wondered a little what she'd find to 
do this summer. She'd be just the one to man- 
age ; and if your house filled up, others would come 
to hand. They generally do, I notice." 

Pearl sat quite disconcerted. Miss Eastwood's 
life had been so different. 

" I only want to be there and see," pleaded Sa- 
brina. " I'd like to feel that I had been really 
useful for once. If I have had any talent, I am 
afraid I have wrapped it up in a napkin, and I 
would like to learn how to use it. Is it forbidden 
that you should take a helper with you in the 
King's Country ? " 

It could not be settled in a minute ; but to^vard 
the last of the week Sabrina wrote to Mrs. Vantine 
that she was going to stay at Wendover a while, and 
then spend the summer with a friend whom she had 
persuaded to take Chester House. She wanted a 
quiet, restful time. She was tired of jaunting 
about. There was a rather, ironical reply to this, 
and a suggestion that brought the scarlet to Miss 
Eastwood's fair face. She had not taken Hollis 
Winchester into account. 




CHAPTER IV 

AS THROUGH A GLASS BY CONSCIENCE HELD 

At thirty, Hollis Winchester had gone far to- 
ward the mark set for himself, a kind of offering 
to his father's memory. There were arrears to 
be made up when Mrs. Eastwood won her suit. 
There was the mill to buy. He had kept the 
aims steadily before him. He was clear of encum- 
brances, and had begun to pile up money. 

After his father's death he had gone to board 
with Mrs. Kent. She lived a little out of the dust 
and confusion, on an old-fashioned, quiet street. 
There was a comfortable old house and a garden. 
He took her two best rooms, and paid her well for 
them. By degrees they had attained to a certain 
luxury. There were capacious stuffed arm-chairs ; 
there were others of willow and rattan, and one 
reclining-chair that could be adapted to any pur- 
pose. The rooms took the western side of the 
house, and in summer were shaded by a great 
sycamore. There were generally two other board- 
ers. There was a Mr. Muir, the book-keeper 




of the sewing-silk mill, a widower of long stand- 
ing, whose two daughters had married, and gone 
to distant cities. And thither one day came 
Parke Olmstead, the new clergyman. The Misses 
Blakeney had taken him in with genteel protest. 
They had the half-century-old adoration of clergy- 
men, and the mannerisms of past decades. They 
filled his room full of flummery. There were 
double curtains to his windows, the inner drapery 
muslin ones tied back with blue bows. The man- 
tel was full of ornaments. He felt his breath con- 
strict whenever he entered it. Then there was a 
pretty, sentimental niece, who wrote verses, and 
had achieved a Sunday-school volume. 

When Olmstead stepped into Mrs. Kent's large, 
light room, with its three windows, curtained only 
by buff shades, its rather spare, plain furniture, 
his heart warmed to it at once. There was a 
wide newly whitewashed fireplace, suggestive of 
winter comfort. There was also a large closet in 
which he could hide away his trunk and any un- 
sightly belongings. So he made his bargain on 
the spot. This was Thursday. On Saturday 
morning he would move in. 

Mrs. Kent said that evening, "The new cler- 
gyman, Mr. Olmstead, is coming here to board, 
Mr. Winchester. I hope you won't — mind." 
That was not quite the word she meant to use. 




"No. Why should I ? " Winchester frowned 
unconsciously ; then raised his brows a trifle. 
" Unless he has the bad taste to preach at meals," 
he appended. 

" He doesn't look preachy. I was going to say 
he doesn't look like a minister, but that would be 
no compliment, nor the truth. He does, every 
inch of him. He is as tall as you, fine-looking, 
with the bluesf eyes you can imagine, and a bit of 
color in his cheeks. About your age too." 

Winchester nodded indifferently. 

" I do wonder how they will get along ! " Mrs. 
Kent said to Calista Spence, a second or third 
cousin, who helped in the housework, a smart, 
thrifty maiden of past forty. "I never thought — 
I was so taken with him. I believe it was his 
voice. It was just like the air and sunshine that 
I let in yesterday, — the first that had a real 
spring feel in it. Spring's late this year. We 
don't have any more early springs." Then she 
sighed, but not about the weather. 

"I do hope they'll get on well together. Of 
course I had the room to let, and I don't think a 
cat could live in comfort at Marietta Blakeney's, 
let alone a minister. She and her sister are too 
finicky for anything. Hollis Winchester minds his 
own business close enough to get rich at it, I'm 
sure, as he is doing. And I just never thought a 



word about the minister part until 'twas all set- 
tled ; but I feel kind of motherly toward Mollis, 
seeing as he has no one." 

"Don't begin to cross bridges till you come to 
'em," said Calista. "Just let 'em alone. Two 
men get along better'n women most times. There 
ain't never no jealousy of each other's good looks, 
I notice." 

Saturday morning, in a cold, drizeling rain that 
would have done credit to February, Mr. Olmstead 
moved in. There was a big trunk, a big valise, 
sundry satchels, a sort of desk table, and book 
boxes that he set up for cases. On the top of 
them he placed a little choice bric-a-brac. There 
were several pictures, a portfolio of fine engrav- 
ings, and his study chair. When it was finished, 
the home appearance gave him a sense of gratifi- 
cation. 

Winchester had gone down to New YorL 
They did not see each other until Sunday even- 
ing at supper. They let each other alone in a 
friendly, manly fashion. Mr. Olmstead had heard 
various comments about Winchester, but he did 
not feel called upon to throw down the glove in 
defiance. He had great respect for the apostolic 
injunction, " As much as lieth in you, live peace- 
ably with all men." 

As the pleasant evenings came on they smoked 



 

on the porch and exchanged ideas on various sub- 
jects, coming to a friendly comprehension of each 
other. Fortunately their political affiliations were 
the same. When they trenched on religious mat- 
ters, Olmstead gave no uncertain sound. 

Winchester opened the door of his " den," as 
he called the sitting-room, and invited the other 
in. That was the last barrier. And this was the 
case one soft, rainy, rather close June evening. 

"Yes, thank you," returned Olmstead, putting 
away some papers, and walking through. The 
Turkish couch, with its cool linen cover, extended 
him an invitation. " I have something to ask 
you. Do you happen to know of a Chester 
House ? It is in a small village called Green- 
fields. You have spent all your life about here" — 

" Chester House ! What have you to do with 
the place ? " his hearer asked abruptly. 

" Nothing with the place. Something with its 
inmates. Is it a summer home } " 

He was quite used to Winchester's brusque 
moods by this time. 

" Well, I hope not. That's one of the modern 
fads, though, — inviting your friends first, to have 
a good time ; then, when you move on to fresh 
fields, entertaining the tU of the slums. Are 
you going to send out a cargo of sick babies ? " 

" Well, I haven't been asked to yet. But there 





are two elderly ladies, invalids, I believe, to 
whom I am to be the bearer of good news. I 
suppose it is good news when one pays up an old, 
outlawed debt, and when some money comes to 
place you above the necessity of struggling for 
bread." 

" It is a sacrilege to turn it into an Old Wo- 
men's Hospital ! " Winchester flung out angrily. 

" Has the place any special interest for you } " 
asked Olmstead in a dignified manner. 

" Interest ! " Winchester roused himself in a 
severely upright position. " It was my father's 
house and mine. I was born there ! I'm not a 
sentimental man — hard-headed and hard-hearted 
you no doubt think me by this time ; but there 
is not a room in that old house, a tree, nor a 
stone, that isn't dear to me ! My father's uncle 
held it, and, having no children of his own, 
adopted my father. There was a great tract of 
ground here, and the nucleus of a mill. My father 
added to it, and built rows of houses for his 
workmen. He had a good, sharp business-head. 
Over there, at Chester House, my mother came as 
a bride. Great-uncle loved her as a daughter. I 
can remember her there, — a small, sweet woman, 
with fair face and a soft voice. She had such a 
pretty garden ! — great borders of May pinks that 
kept all the air fragrant, and later such gorgeous 





carnations, — white, pink, and soft-colored reds 
such as we seldom see now. There were beds 
of lavender, thyme, and sweet herbs. And such 
roses ! " 

There was a long silence. Winchester was 
staring into vacancy. 

" You interest me wonderfully," said the other 
in a gentle tone. " And then " — 

" She died. Then the old uncle died. He 
had willed everything to my father. Some other 
people started up with the claim that he had only 
a life-right, and could not will it away. My 
father fought it, and beat them. Then they tried 
it again, and were beaten. After a while they 
made a third attempt, with a batch of papers 
they had found, which my father always in- 
sisted were forged. Well, they won, — this girl's 
mother. They were going to make a clean sweep 
of everything. The woman had no soul, no con- 
science ! Father bought in the mill site. All 
the property here was sold. Then there were 
some awfully tight times. The woman died, and 
father made an offer for Chester House, but it 
could not be sold till this girl came of age. That 
was two and a half years ago. He had gone over 
to the great majority then, but I made my essay, 
and — was refused, of course," with a contemptu- 
ous bitterness. "They have never lived there. 





The place has been rented out, the farm to one 
party, the house to another. Some very nice peo- 
ple have had it, living there about nine months of 
the year. The man died early this season, and 
the last I heard the real owner was to try it. 
But she's one of the high lights of fashion, and 
charity is fashionable nowadays." 

Olmstead had never been so interested in his 
fellow-boarder. There was a depth of sentiment 
to him that had lain unsuspected. He was curi- 
ously excited about the present owner. 

"There are worse undertakings than charity, 
though I am beginning to feel that some of them 
are ill-judged. But perhaps this young woman 
may have some kind of regard that you do not 
understand." 

" Nonsense ! Why, this girl's mother had never 
been inside the house ! She had no doubt indoc- 
trinated her daughter with a tremendous hatred 
of our branch of the family. There is nothing to 
do now but to wait and tire her out, or to snap up 
the place through a third party. In some cases 
I could exercise untiring patience. But if she 
should donate it to a society — you see, she's had 
a sharp, shrewd, speculating sort of guardian, 
who has turned her money over and over for her. 
I was surprised myself when I found out how 
much she had. Good heavens ! Well, you see 





now why I am interested, and why I keep a sharp 
look-out. I wonder if you will find it on your con- 
science to warn her ?" 

The tone stirred an instant flash of resentment. 
Calming himself by a strong effort, he made 
answer quietly : — 

" When you have known me longer, you may be 
able to judge me more correctly." 

"I beg your pardon, Olmstead ; I do sincerely. 
This business stirs up all the bad blood in me. 
And I think you had a story I interrupted. You 
are to carry the tidings of good fortune to two old 
ladies. Well, I hope you will make them very 
happy. And allow me also to hope they will 
prove worthy. " 

" The great point of interest to me was the 
other side of the matter." 

" Isn't the money come honestly by ? We 
have so many queer questions of ethics nowa- 
days." 

Olmstead was silent. Winchester's careless 
words had started another problem in his 
thoughts. 

"Well.?" 

" It is a matter of restitution. It might not 
interest you. I do not want to bore you." 

" Nonsense, my good fellow ! I didn't hesitate 
to bore you with this feud of the rival houses. 





And some day I may have a similar question to 
decide. Restitution ! So the other party had de- 
frauded, or thought he had." 

He piqued Olmstead by the inflection of doubt 
in his tone. 

"He had. He had been rather an unscrupu- 
lous business man, keeping within the letter of 
the law perhaps. I don't know about his life. 
At one time, twenty years or so before, he took 
money of various people to invest. He had 
known of these two women, and persuaded them 
to intrust a part of their small means to his ma- 
nipulations. For a while all went on well. Then 
came a financial crisis, and every one had to take 
his share of the loss." 

" That was right enough," declared Winchester 
fiercely. "Doesn't everybody know " — 

"They take a man's word," said Olmstead 
quietly. " The older generation of women had, I 
think, a greater respect for it. And if those who 
trusted this man suffered, his wife did not. He 
went on living in her house and spending her 
money. By and by, when he had freed himself 
from legal difficulties, he went at money-making 
again, and succeeded. He had a son, a fine young 
fellow, who died after a brief illness. His wife 
died. Then — he was past seventy at this time — 
he was called upon to face a stealthy, incurable 





disease. He planned to give his fortune to some 
charity, to be handed down to posterity as a man 
who loved his fellow-men. He had begun to con- 
sider himself quite in the light of a philan- 
thropist." 

" Yes,' said Winchester in the pause. 

" I won't trouble you with the processes by 
which he came to see that restitution was a more 
honest thing than philanthropy. There were a 
good many people whom he had wronged ; there is 
no intermediate word for it. He made amends. 
Two of these cases were left to me. One I found 
quite easily, the other I have been following by a 
slender clew, missing here and there ; and at last 
the parties have been traced. A fortnight ago 
they were taken to Chester House. It devolves 
on me now to hunt them up and have them bring 
forward their proofs. So that is my errand to 
Chester House, — to find a Miss Barclay and a 
Mrs. Duane, and to restore their own to them." 

"Quite a romance," said Winchester. 

"I started to ask for directions. I have only 
a vague idea of Greenfields. My drives have not 
been in that direction, and my walks mostly about 
Brentford." 

" It lies north-easterly, five or six miles. Green- 
fields is a sort of farming village that has hardly 
changed since my childhood. There's an old mill 





on the spur of the river. You take the road above 
it, half a mile or so. There is only one house 
between. If you like to ride out on Brown Bess, 
you would enjoy it wonderfully." 

" Thanks." 

Then Winchester lighted his lamp and began to 
read his paper. Olmstead's mind reverted to this 
episode, met in his last winter's work in New 
York. All that long life of threescore and ten 
had been devoted to money-getting. Here was a 
superior young life taking up the same aim, to the 
exclusion of all else. 

The soft summer darkness fell around. How 
quiet, fragrant, and peaceful it was out here ! 
Olmstead, who was no ascetic, wondered now and 
then what of the ills of life he should share with 
his brethren, as far-reaching, conscientious souls 
often do. 

He mounted brown Bess the next morning, 
and had a delightful gallop through country roads, 
sometimes narrowing almost to lanes. The undu- 
lating fields and broad meadows, broken here and 
there by a belt of timber in stately growth, made 
a series of beautiful, tranquil pictures. Here was 
the old ruined mill, the stream almost choked up 
with alders, willows, and clumps of wild bloom. 
From here, there was a decided ascent. He passed 
a small, low farmhouse, immaculate in white paint ; 





he came to the row of giant elms, with their long, 
drooping, fringy arms. He turned into the drive- 
way ; there was no gate. The' hard path took a 
slight curve, and deflected at the side of the house, 
— a large, low story and a half house, with a gradu- 
ally sloping roof that, after the small windows, 
seemed to continue itself in the wide porch roof. 
The thin turf all around hardly had leave to grow, 
the great tree-roots depriving it of sustenance. Yet 
they were far enough apart to let in the sunshine, 
though they crowded out the smaller shrubbery. 
At one corner stood a spreading syringa, at the 
other a tangle of vines and clustering roses still in 
bloom. The broad porch, raised only two steps, 
was in full view as you took the turn. There was 
a hammock across each end ; there were willow 
and splint lounging-chairs. The hall door stood 
hospitably open, a wide space losing itself at last 
in a mass of shady greenery. 

Two persons sat on the porch. The one in the 
high-back chair startled Olmstead by her pallor 
and the utter physical attenuation. Even the hand 
she raised seemed transparent. The waves of soft 
white hair, the draping folds of a white shawl wound 
about her, served to intensify the impression. It 
had a refined delicacy ; even the worn and wrinkled 
face still held traces of high-bred comeliness. 

The younger woman, sitting farther at the end, 





rose and took a step forward as he sprang off the 
horse. There was a strong likeness between them, 
and by some subtle intuition he knew these were 
the two he had come to find. 

" Miss Disbrowe will be back in a few mo- 
ments,' she said in a low, refined tone, with an 
old-fashioned accent of formalism. " Will you be 
seated, and shall I call her at once ? " 

" No, do not summon her. My errand is not so 
much with her. I came to find a Miss Barclay, 
and her sister, Mrs. Duane " — 

" I am Mrs. Duane, and this is my sister."

When Miss Barclay attempted to speak, she was 
interrupted by a spasm of coughing, which she 
tried to repress as one does after long experience. 
There was ten or a dozen years' difference in their 
ages ; indeed, Mrs. Duane was the youngest of 
quite a large family. 

" I am Mr. Olmstead, a clergyman from Brent- 
ford. Last winter I was in New York. I came 
to know a Mr. Rowland there, who died three 
months ago. Some years before, you had busi- 
ness — money transactions with him."

The sisters glanced at each other with terrified 
eyes. 

" He came to see many things in a truer light, 
and made restitution for wrongs that he repented 
of. This is one instance. The executors have 



 

been endeavoring to find you. We learned that 
you made a change in May, then all trace was lost 
for a while." 

" Yes,' Mrs. Duane said. " Restitution. You 
do not mean " — there was a kind of incredulous 
sob in her voice. 

''I mean that the original sum, with accrued 
interest,, is awaiting your pleasure." 

"O Margaret ! Thank God it has not come 
too late ! " She bowed her head over her sister, 
and took the frail hands in hers. Olmstead was 
touched by the strong, quiet depths of emotion. 

" Pardon us," Mrs. Duane said, as she raised her 
head, the tears still dimming her eyes. " You are 
young, strong, and full of hope. You cannot un- 
derstand what it is to have all your dependence 
swept away by slow, cruel strokes ; to come to the 
last of life and tread a dreary way whose only out- 
look seems the charity of some institution. All 
winter my sister has been ill. We were compelled 
to give up the room, where we had a few comforts, 
and hide away, as the poor often do. Then an 
angel came to us, and lifted us out of the noisome 
depths, and set us in a high place, brought us 
to the very gates of heaven. Is there any good 
thing left."Is the Lord restoring tenfold — giv- 
ing ' beauty for ashes ' ? " 

She covered her face with her hands, as her 





voice died away. He thought he had never seen 
a more pathetic picture. The traces of deprivation 
were evident in every line, in every feature the 
hard, grinding struggle with poverty. He had 
often pitied the little children — did any one ever 
give that intense sympathy to old age, needing 
it tenfold more ? 

" That we should have it in our power to reward 
our dear Miss Disbrowe, thank God ! " said Miss 
Barclay tremulously. "Not that she would want 
any return, but it may assist her in rescuing other 
suffering souls. Call her, Esther." ^ 

She was coming through the hall. She made 
a slight pause, but Mrs. Duane stretched out her 
hand. 

" Come," she said gently. " Come and hear 
the tidings the Lord has sent. I am glad now it 
did not reach us sooner. We should never have 
known you in that case. And it is worth all the 
suffering to find such an angel of deliverance." 

She presented Olmstead to her. The delicate 
manner of doing it touched him. 

"Now," she rejoined, "tell us our good news 
over again. We have been out of the world so 
long that we may need younger and fresher knowl- 
edge. But " — with a sudden terror — " the note 
is outlawed." 

" Right and justice are never outlawed," re- 



 

sponded Parke Olmstead. Then he resumed his 
seat and went over the story in a brief, explicit 
fashion, stating that it would be necessary for one 
of the ladies to go to New York with him, and 
take the papers to prove her claim. The money 
was there awaiting her. Could she go to-morrow ? 

She looked uncertainly at Miss Disbrowe. He 
wondered a little ; but his hesitation was settled by 
the young girl glancing across to him smilingly. 

" Would you like me to go with you ? " she 
asked. An expression of intense relief lighted up 
Mrs. Duane's face, as her grateful smile answered. 
The arrangements were made accordingly. 

"I cannot attempt to thank you," the poor 
woman said, with a great effort to steady her 
voice. Olmstead bowed and smiled. 







CHAPTER V 

IN WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS 

"What a lovely old place!" Parke Olmstead 
said. And this girl, he thought, was its owner. 
What a curious impression Winchester must have 
taken of her ! 

" You may like to have a more extended view," 
Miss Disbrowe suggested, stepping out on the 
path. He followed her, though brown Bess whin- 
nied softly, indicating her wish, round the path to 
the south, past the two long rooms, coming to a 
sort of hollow square flanked by a long ell, in 
which was another wide porch, — so wide, indeed, 
so well roofed, that it suggested delightful teas 
in the waning light of day. There was a tall, 
gnarled old pear-tree that stood sentinel. The 
square was divided into flower-beds with box bor- 
ders, some of them thin and ragged. Here was 
the garden of carnations and sweet herbs. There 
were still some old-fashioned flowers, and clumps 
of modern geraniums that looked out of place in 
their staring brightness. 





" You have grown very fond of the place, and I 
do not wonder," he said, with an impulse of con- 
victioii. She was so different from his precon- 
ceived idea of her. "Yet I wonder if one — if 
you could be content with a lifetime of it ? " 

'She glanced up questioningly. 

" It is quaint and leisurely aspected," he went 
on. "You could sit here with plenty of time 
for the long, elegant sentences of Addison, and 
Miss Burney's novels. Your friends might have 
stepped out of them." 

" I have not gone farther back than De Quincey 
and Carlyle and Scott," she returned, a little puz- 
zled. "The modern scurrying novel, with its tense 
life, would be out of place here," and Pearl glanced 
slowly around. " I wonder if it is any truer ? " 

" Nearer like the life of the cities, no doubt. 
But do we need to intensify the tragic side, and 
live it over in our stories ? When one is in the 
thick of the fray it is the rest and peace farther 
on that holds out the greatest satisfaction. And 
perhaps it is so when one comes from the whirl 
of fashion ? " 

She did not understand the half inquiry, nor 
feel inclined to talk about herself. " I wonder 
if you can realize the joy, the comfort and peace, 
you have brought this morning," she began again 
with grave sweetness. " Not that these poor souls 





would have been allowed to suffer again. But it 
is very hard to have had sufficient means, and have 
it wrested from you by the wrong-doing of others. 
For so many losses come through that. These 
women have been heroic in their industry, in their 
economies and self-denials. They have had a loss 
here, a loss there, and you can see they are not 
the kind to battle with untoward circumstances. 
They were tenderly reared, educated in the accom- 
plishments of their day. Their first misfortune 
was a dishonest executor of their father's estate." 
" You have known them a long while ? " 
" No ; only since last winter. And I am afraid 
for Miss Barclay even this will come too late. 
She took a cold, and was very ill when I found 
her. And when people are in a state of semi- 
starvation — oh, why could not this man have re- 
pented a year sooner ! Do you know, I sometimes 
grudge the full penny at the eleventh hour! " 

" We all think one of the noblest lines in the 
immortal charge is : — 

" ' Theirs not to reason why;' 

and the soldier in the other brigade is sometimes 
confronted with the same problem, the same need 
of doing, of marching according to orders. Why 
is not it as brave ? And all the reasons are in the 
heart of God. We can't see them. There is the 
veil between." 





" Yes ? " with a lingering inflection. 

" I want to thank you for your kindness in be- 
half of these poor souls. And if he could know 
— he saw very clearly at the last — alas, that it 
should have been at the last ! " 

They were making a circuit of the flower gar- 
den, and were now returning to the main path. 
Out beyond lay a vegetable garden, fields, and 
great sweeps of meadowland. 

"From the top of the hill you can see the 
Sound," Miss Disbrowe said. " From our upper 
windows we can catch glimpses of it." 

A curious thought of Winchester crossed his 
mind. Could this girl have been so rigorous in 
her disregard of his wishes, his regard for his old 
home ? 

" I am lingering unconscionably," he said. Yet 
he was so interested, he could have spent the 
whole morning speculating about her. He could 
not come to any sense of real study with these 
evident contradictions. She seemed so singularly 
free from young-girl consciousness ; yet there was 
nothing of the worldly woman about her. 

"And we are to meet you at Sandon," she said. 
"The train goes at 9.10. Oh, I hope nothing 
will happen ! It seems too unreal. And yet peo- 
ple in the depths of poverty have fortunes left 
to them. But," with a vague smile, "the owner 





cannot help dying, and as little can he take his 
fortune with him." 

"You think real, earnest repentance rare?" 

" Restitution. I have been thinking of this 
man. It must have been a powerful conviction 
that induced him to relinquish the charity, and 
turn back to simple honesty." 

"It was." Parke Olmstead colored a little. He 
went up and stroked Bess's face, and she shook 
out her mane impatiently. Then he vaulted into 
the saddle, and touched his hand to his hat. 

" Why couldn't Winchester have fallen in love 
with her ! that would have settled it," he thought. 
Then he realized the tangible differences. " But 
her soul isn't bound up in the old place as his is. 
One has the true love of inheritance. If there 
was any wrong, she is guiltless." • 

He turned Bess into the mill-yard, though she 
was not stabled with the draught horses. Win- 
chester came out of the office with a repressed 
eagerness in every line of his face, amounting 
almost to a scowl. 

" I have seen the old place, the old garden, and 
Miss Disbrowe. I shouldn't suspect her of fight- 
ing," and a softening of the mouth did duty for 
a smile. 

"Miss Disbrowe.?" Winchester raised his 
brows with perplexed inquiry. 





"Isn't she"— 

"The owner of Chester House is a Miss Sa- 
brina Eastwood. To mention her age would be 
ungallant, but somewhere about two years and 
a half ago she attained her majority. She is on 
the side where it is safe to laugh at time. I do not 
know anything about Miss Disbrowe. Is she 
young or old ? " 

" Young." 

" And you found your people ? " 

" Yes. I had a ^magnificent ride^ thanks to 
you." 

Winchester turned away, and led Bess to the 
stables. Olmstead had some calls on his mind. 
He could put them in between this and noon. 
They had dinner at the old-fashioned hour of 
twelve at Mrs. Kent's. But as he went he said 
to himself, " Sabrina Eastwood. ' Sabrina, cool 
and fair.' " Where had he heard the name be- 
fore ? Some glimmer of the past, something he 
ought to remember, that evaded him. 

Miss Disbrowe suggested it curiously. A bit 
of hesitation, some puzzle or uncertainty, a touch 
of pity or regret. Well, it would come to him ; 
many things did, sooner or later. 

Miss Eastwood remembered better. When 
Pearl had rejoiced with, soothed and comforted, 
her " old ladies," she went up-stairs to tell Sa- 





brina the wonderful story. She kept the bit of 
pasteboard in her hand, bending it gently out and 
in, with a restless movement that rarely came to her. 

" It sounds like a romance," returned Sabrina, 
" Do you suppose this clergyman made him do 
it, Pearl, as a Roman priest sometimes insists 
upon restitution ? I am afraid it isn't an underly- 
ing law in all creeds. But it must have taken 
some courage, when the man had resolved to leave 
a great name behind him, — to found a charity. 
That is really the strong point in the matter. 
What is this Mr. — the clergyman, like .^ " 

" Mr. Olmstead, Mr. Parke Olmstead ;" and she 
tossed the card gracefully over into Sabrina's lap. 
" I can't tell, really. I think I never actually 
looked. He is tall and has a curious voice, — a 
sort of penetrating, inspiring, glad, stirring voice ; 
just the kind to come with good tidings. I think 
he persuaded the dying man, -Sabrina ; impressed 
him with the right, until he couldn't help doing 
justice. I like him. There is something manly 
in his air and bearing. But I was so taken up 
with all the other " — 

" And that has come to an end," said Sabrina 
disappointedly. "Now something will happen 
to Miss Vasilis, and our occupation will be gone. 
We shall have to go back to the pomps and van- 
ities of the world." 



Pearl smiled. " No, it is not anywhere near 
ended. And even this fortnight — oh, when you 
think of that dreadful den (can any one call it by 
a better name ?), that wretched little room, with 
no outlook but the windows opposite, so near, you 
could see into the neighboring apartment ; the vile- 
smelling court, with its lines of wet clothes ; the 
close, bad air of the house ; the commingled odors 
of cooking ; the crying children ; the scolding, 
brawling women ! And to have no peace day nor 
night, amid the multitude no man can number, I 
was going to say," and Pearl gave a faint smile,
