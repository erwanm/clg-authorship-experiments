"You are not likely to lose me very long at a 
time," was Jessie's rejoinder. 

Mr. Meredith drew Kathie on the sofa beside him, 
while Jessie brushed her tumbled hair, and they had 
a sweet, half-sad talk concerning the changes that 
were to be. 

" And how is Eob ? " he asked, directly. " I can't 
tell you how I want to see him." 

" He is very well, and doing remarkably in his 
studies, Uncle Eobert thinks. I do believe he is 
more in earnest than ever before." 

" I predict that Eob comes out all right in the end. 
like the prince in the fairy story. You see, Kathie, 
it is hard work for boys to be good. But the key- 
note of Eob's heart has been touched." 

She knew what he meant by the peculiar light in 
his eyes. 

" I never can bear to hear Eob blamed altogether 
for that," she returned, softly. " It was a good deal 
my fault." 

" But we were so thankful to have you alive once 
more, that we never had the heart to scold you," he 
answered, gayly. 

The tea-bell rang at that moment, and they both 



 

insisted that Katliie should stay, promising to accom- 
pany her home afterward. 

" The child grows dearer and sweeter every day," 
said Grandmother Darrell, after she had kissed her 
M good-night." 





CHAPTEE II. 

AUNT EUTH'S NEW LIFE. 

THERE was a quiet wedding at Cedarwood one 
sunshiny November day. Eob came home from 
school as a special privilege. A few choice friends 
were gathered in the spacious parlor, that was fra- 
grant and beautiful with fknvers. Kathie had ar- 
ranged them. Not any great stately pyramids, but 
slender vases filled with the rarest, and small mounds 
of dainty loveliness covering the dishes whereon they 
were gracefully strewn. For the perfume and bright 
freshness it might have been a midsummer day. 
And with some of the taller house-plants and long 
trails of ground-pine Uncle Robert had arranged a 
sort of arch where Aunt Ruth was to stand. 

She came down quietly, after the guests were as- 
sembled, in her soft gray silk, that did not rustle, but 
fell about her in clinging folds. There was the faint- 
est flush on her cheek, that gave her a touch of lin- 
gering girlishness. Was it the patient grace oj' 



 

affection that had kept her so young ? There had 
been many hard, dreary years to live through, yet 
some very bright sunshine had come at last. 

General Mackenzie looked very brave and noble 
in his military dress, and that peculiar tender refine- 
ment in his face that had come from the practice of 
the higher virtues, rather than worldly polish, - - a 
Christian gentleman, who had sought first the king- 
dom of heaven, and then had all other things added 
to him. He listened and responded reverentially, 
and took the proffered hand in his with the sweet- 
ness and faith of a great love. And, after the last 
words had been uttered, he stooped and kissed her. 

" I never saw anything more solemnly beautiful 
in my life," Jessie said. " I could hardly keep the 
tears from coming into my eyes, and I thought all 
the time that it was just as much a marriage in 
heaven as here upon earth." 

" Aunt Euth deserves every bit of happiness,' de- 
clared Kob. " And I am glad there is so much style 
about it, that he is a general, and that they are go- 
ing to Washington. I would like to give one rous- 
ing hurrah ! " 

Kathie smiled in spite of herself. 



 

There was a refreshment table in the dining-room, 
and after the congratulations the company went out. 
Aunt Euth cut the cake and received the good wishes 
in her lady-like manner. Then she went up stairs to 
put on her bonnet and gloves. 

" My dear niece Kathie," the General said, " how 
little we could have thought of this, the night so long 
ago when I first met you ! Yet a charm in your sweet 
child's face attracted me involuntarily. And now, if 
I have taken something precious out of your life, I 
hope to be able to place fresh blessings in it. You 
are so generous with all of yours." 

Kathie's lip quivered and her voice failed when 
she would have spoken. But she understood how it 
was, and how these exchanges were going on all over 
the world, every one bringing the soul nearer to the 
great brotherhood of angels above, who give continu- 
ally, asking nothing back. 

" So, for the present, your loss is my gain, but some 
day I will share my joys with you as a member of 
your happy household. We shall not forget you for 
an hour." 

Kathie smiled her thanks for the cordial tone, but 
she confessed to Jessie afterward that she felt very 



 

much like crying. " I didn't suppose weddings could 
be so sad,' she said. 

Quite a party went to the station. General Mac- 
kenzie was going directly to West Point to give 
Bruce a sight of his new mother, and thence to 
Washington, where business would occupy him for 
the next six weeks. Jessie and Mr. Meredith had 
their house settled to their liking, and were to return 
immediately. Eob begged hard to stay until the next 
morning, to have a chance to see some of the boys. 
" Because I am going to study up, and not lose a 
single recitation. I promised Dr. Goldthwaite." 

They did not see much of him until bed-time. 
Kathie had a quiet evening with mamma and Uncle 
Eobert, for Freddy had supplied himself so bounti- 
fully with luxuries that he had gone to bed with a 
headache and no supper. 

The event made quite a stir in Brookside ; it must 
be confessed. 

" I wonder what the Haddens would say to that ! ' 
exclaimed Sue Coleman. " Kathie Alston certainly 
has the most elegant friends and connections of any 
girl I know. I should not wonder if she went to 
Europe some day, and eclipsed us all" 



 

Mrs. George Meredith was as much astonished as 
anybody. 

" The idea of such a man marrying a woman who 
is lame, and not particularly handsome, nor rich, nor 
young ! Why, he might have had almost any one in 
our set. He is so fine-looking and cultivated, and has 
such a nice position. It is a shame for him to throw 
himself away ! " 

So had she bewailed her brother-in-law's marriage ; 
and yet she could not help admitting in her secret 
heart that hardly one among her fashionable friends 
would have been as sweet and generous as Jessie. 
She was learning by bitter and humiliating experi- 
ence that those who had flattered and caressed her in 
the midst of opulence would not turn out of their 
way now to give her a kind word or a moment's 
pleasure. 

Mr. Meredith had been a most indulgent husband. 
During their prosperity he had allowed his wife to 
indulge her expensive tastes lavishly. But he was a 
man of sound principles and strict integrity where 
business was concerned. He had not looked for his 
brother to come forward so nobly and help him 
regain his lost position, but, now that opportunity 



 

offered, he meant to use the utmost energy in en- 
deavoring to retrieve the past. He would allow him- 
self and his farnilv no needless indulgence that might 

" O O 

tend to jeopardize another's fortune. 

Mrs. Meredith thought this extremely hard. Her 
husband's position among men was nearly the same 
as heretofore ; indeed, his manly course had brought 
him warmer, truer friends. After a few years of re- 
trenchment he might find himself on a firm basis, 
once more a prosperous man. But it seemed as if 
she was compelled to give up everything. She had 
pleaded for a grander house than the one he proposed. 

" My dear wife," he said, " we cannot afford it. We 
must practice the strictest economy for some time to 
come. I will not risk Edward's money, since he has 
been so generous for my sake. I have fixed the ut- 
most limit for our expenses this year, and we must 
not exceed it." 

" But it is so cruel now, when Ada was just begin- 
ning to go into society. It ruins her chances for 
everything. By the time we can attain to any style 
she will be faded, unattractive, and past youth. No 
one will want to marry her." 

" It seems that some one wanted to marry Miss 



 

Conover," he returned. " If Ada can do as well as 
that when she is past thirty, I shall be satisfied." 

Ada bemoaned the state of affairs no less bitterly. 
And when, at last, they did decide upon an incon- 
venient, chsaply built house, whose greatest recom- 
mendation was a rather stylish neighborhood, and 
began to settle themselves, the task seemed harder 
and more hopeless than ever. The tidy, practised 
French nurse had been superseded by a young girl at 
less than half the wages, while the kitchen was given 
over to a very ordinary cook. The younger children 
grew untidy and disorderly, the meals were served in 
a careless fashion, instead of the once neat and ele- 
gant manner. 

" But what can one do ! ' Mrs. Meredith would 
exclaim. " Cheap servants, like cheap furniture, 
never are worth the having. If your father could 
see this, Ada ; but he is like other men. He can 
understand nothing outside of his business. And 
how we are to live on such a mere pittance puz- 
zles me ! ' 

Ada didn't think it her place to dust the parlor 
or replace the scattered articles, or to look after the 
children. George and Willie were sent to school, and 


 

soon became insufferably noisy. Florence, missing 
the steady hand that had amused and governed, and 
growing tired of the lonesome nursery, fretted every 
one out of patience. Mary let the steam of washing 
and cooking get through the house, the tires were 
always going out, and the place was as comfortless 
as one could well imagine. 

Now and then Mrs. Meredith roused herself and 
made a spasmodic effort, but the task appeared so 
hopeless ! " There was nothing to do with," she de- 
clared continually. Ada practised her music a little, 
lounged in her own room, and, having no other re- 
source, eagerly devoured novels of all kinds, or took a 
languid walk, to be slighted and wounded by a cold 
recognition from some bygone friend, whom she be- 
wailed, in her solitude, with tears. 

Jessie tried to rouse her from her depression, but 
Ada met all her efforts with cold indifference. She 
invited her to dinners or suppers with a few pleasant 
guests, but even here she would not make herself 
agreeable. " It was not what she had been used to. 
Aunt Jessie was well enough in her way, but ' 

And so all the wide, rich, beautiful life beyond, 
teeming with love and duty, springs and seedtimes, 



 

summers ana fruits, golden autumns and gracious 
harvest fields, were shut out. No pure, breezy, fresh- 
ening air to stir and quicken her soul, no tender 
thoughts for her irritable heart and brain, no kindly 
deeds for her listless hands. 

But not so with Kathie. There was the " next " to 
her, the new duty in the place of the old one finished, 
or slipped out, or gone into other hands. Her circle 
was continually widening, her lines of sympathy 
reached out hither and thither and found something 
to draw in or cling to. It was a little lonesome at 
first, and once in a while, when she lay on the crim- 
son lounge in Aunt Ruth's room, after the lessons 
and reading were finished, she couldn't help having 
a quiet little cry over the places where a smile had 
vanished and a tender voice was heard no more. She 
was very easily touched to the heart, for all her 
cheerful ways. 

So at home she began to take up Freddy, who, 
like all the rest of the world, seemed growing apace ; 
growing out of playthings into books, growing out of 
baby inconsequence into thought and wonder and 
gleams of shrewd wisdom. He had little of Rob's 
boisterous spirit of fun and careless indifference, and 



 

none of his touchy pride in being "fond of the 
girls." 

Kathie gave him some simple music lessons and 
taught him to sing with her. She let him drive the 
pony-carriage, and Uncle Eobert had taught him to 
ride Jasper. 

At school the circle widened as well. She was 
getting over her shyness somewhat. The elder girls 
found her a very charming companion, and they be- 
gan to think no party complete without her. Per- 
haps the great thing was that she never carried an 
obtrusive self about with her. She did not aim for 
the high places, the prettiest characters in tableaux, 
or the brightest parts in charades, and yet, when 
everybody else was satisfied, there was always some 
particular thing that every one insisted she could do 
better than the others. 

" Do you know how very near it is to Christmas, 
Uncle Eobert ? ' she asked, one afternoon. " What 
are we going to do ? ' 

" I wonder what you would like best of all ? ' 

She placed her books on the convenient shelf, and 
hung up her hat. 

" I don't know, I have had so many things. You 
remember what Mr. Meredith said in his letter ? " 



 

" Well, shall we go and keep Christmas with 
them ? " 

There was something in Uncle Robert's face that 
mystified her, the least little touch of amusement 
that she could not quite understand. 

" O, they are coming here ! " she exclaimed. 

" No. Guess again." 

" Aunt Euth will be home, then." 

" Not quite that, either." 

" Well, I am sure I cannot tell, then." 

" We had letters to-day. Here is yours. Perhaps 
it may give you a new idea for Christmas." 

She read it eagerly. A long, sweet epistle from 
Aunt Ruth, and a postscript from the General. 

" Oh ! " she exclaimed. " If I really could ! If 
you wouldn't feel lonesome. And then to have 
them come back with me ! ' 

" It will be very pleasant for you. General Mac- 
kenzie will return on the third of January, spending 
some three or four days in New York, so you will 
have a chance to see Jessie and Mr. Meredith." 

" It is altogether enchanting, like the things that 
used to happen when I half believed in fairies. But 
can I really go ? " 



 

" Your mother thinks so. It will keep you out of 
school for a week, but you must study the harder 
afterward. And it is such an excellent opportunity." 

" I don't know what to say. Where is mamma ? " 

" She went out with Mrs. Grayson to visit a family 
in great distress." 

It seemed to Kathie as if there ought not to be any 
pain or sorrow in the world when she was so entirely 
happy. Then she had to read her letter over again. 
Only six weeks since Aunt Euth was married, and 
yet it appeared half a lifetime. And to go to Wash- 
ington ! to see the Capitol, the great mansions, the 
President himself, perhaps. Oh ! wasn't it the least 
little bit of a dream ? 

A friend of the General would escort Kathie from 
Jersey City, if it was inconvenient for Uncle Robert 
to take the journey. He was to leave on the morn- 
ing of the twenty-third, and would meet them at the 
depot or the hotel where he was staying. So, if Ka- 
thie would write back immediately, the matter could 
be put in train at once. 

They made all arrangements that evening, and she 
wrote her letter in a most delightful mood. 

" I declare it is too bad ! " said one of the girls the 



 

next day. " Here we are going to have a Christmas 
fair and two surprise-parties, and charades at Hattie 
Norman's. How are we to get along without you ? " 

Kathie glanced up and met Emma Lauriston's eyes. 
Both remembered a time when they were quite elated 
in the prospect of " getting along " without her. But 
Kathie's sunny nature held no grudges. She was 
only too glad to be good friends with all the girls, to 
bring her gifts, if she had any, to bear upon the little 
every-day living which, after all, is the great wheel 
that turns the world. 

" Everything lovely does come to you, but I am 
sure you deserve it," Emma whispered, softly. 

" I wonder if you will go to any receptions ? and, 
oh ! what will you wear ? ' : 

Kathie laughed. 

" I suppose I shall see everything that can be seen 
in that brief while " ; but she couldn't help thinking 
that the dearest sight of all would be Aunt Euth. 

It required some courage to keep strictly to the 
lessons after that. Bruce wrote her a letter in which 
he said he did not envy any one in the world, but he 
thought he would just as lief be Kathie Alston for 
ten or twelve days, beginning at Christmas, as a 
great overgrown boy at a military academy. 



 

He had accepted and liked his new mother very 
cordially. Of his own he had a very slight remem- 
brance, and to boys without homes or mothers a 
gentle, considerate love like this is very tender and 
sweet. 

" It is too bad that he cannot go as well," Kathie 
said to Uncle Robert. " I have so many nice times 
that I do begin to feel conscience smitten when I 
think of all who are crowded out." 

So, at last, Kathie's small trunk was packed and 
directed, and Uncle Eobert took her down to the 
city. As she had to start early, he decided that it 
would be better for them to stay at the hotel, for 
convenience in the morning. So they hunted up Mr. 
Winterdyne, and found him a very pleasant, agreeable 
gentleman, past forty. He had seen General Mac- 
kenzie and his wife only the week before, and had 
heard all about this little niece, and would be very 
glad to take charge of her during the rather tiresome 
journey. 

She was up betimes, as fresh and sweet as a 
rose. The morning was cold and gray, so her happy 
face was like a gleam of sunshine. Uncle Robert 
said good-by at the gateway, and Mr. Winterdyne 



 

drew her arm through his, quite as if she had been a 
young lady. He seated her carefully near the win- 
dow, hung up his satchel and umbrella, chatting 
pleasantly so that she might not feel strange. And 
then they steamed slowly out of the depot and were 
on their way. 

" We shall have a storm before noon, I think," 
Mr. Winterdyne said, presently. " It threatens 



snow.' : 



" Do you suppose it will delay us ? " Kathie asked, 
that she had started she could think only of the 
journey's end. 

" no, I guess not. The weather may moderate, 
and in that case it is more likely to be rain, as we go 
farther south." 

He talked to Kathie quite a while, naming the 
towns they passed and giving bits of their history. 
Then two gentlemen came through the car and en- 
gaged him in a business conversation. 

" Your daughter, Winterdyne ? " asked one of them. 

" No. General Mackenzie's niece. I am taking 
her to Washington. Miss Alston." 

Kathie gave a timid little bow to the pleasant eyes 
that smiled upon her. 



 

" Have you ever been in Washington before ? " he 
asked. 

Kathie answered in the negative. 

" Quite commonplace again, eh, Winterdyne ? The 
camps and barracks arid armies have vanished. We 
can hardly believe now that we have lived through 
such a terrible struggle. But many a brave fellow 
never came back again. Eomances and tragedies 
were common in those days." 

" Yes." 

" Did you ever know Ned Meredith ? " 

" I think not." 

Kathie started in quick surprise at the name. 

" The poor fellow had a hard time of it, was 
wounded and barely lived. A right pretty girl came 
on and married him, and I guess that pulled him 
through as much as anything. I took dinner witli 
them a few days ago, and they are as happy as bees 
in clover. There were some brave little women as 
well. So you have a taste for romances ? " and he 
smiled over at Kathie again. 

" It was all reality to me, to us," she said. " My 
uncle was there at the time, and Mrs. Meredith is a 
very dear friend." 



 

" Oh ! " and he studied her again. " I think I re- 
member you by a picture. Isn't it Kathie Alston ? 
and was not your uncle a Mr. Conover? Why, I 
feel quite well acquainted. 

Kathie listened to the story of the marriage again, 
and some incidents of coolness and bravery on Mr. 
Meredith's part that somehow touched her heart and 
made her feel prouder than ever of him. 

At Trenton the new friends shook hands and 
parted. 

" It is beginning to snow," said Mr. Winterdyne. 
" Are you comfortable ? would you like to look over 
any of these books ? " 

Presently they reached Philadelphia, and Kathie 
was very much interested in the strange sights. Mr. 
Winterdyne took her out on the platform a few mo- 
ments, for a little rest and a breath of fresh air, he 
said. Then they whirled on and on again, but the 
snow seemed to gain and the wind blew it in eddy- 
ing gusts. It spoiled the prospect, as they could see 
nothing beyond dim outlines. 

Kathie read a little, for she did not wish to annov 

her kind escort by claiming too much of his attention. 
The motion of the cars and the silence made her quite 
drowsy, and she could not help nodding. 



 

It was rather late when they reached their desti- 
nation, owing to the unavoidable delay of the storm. 
Kathie felt somewhat frightened amid the din and 
hurry and strange faces that stared at her at every 
turn. Mr. Winterdyne pushed his way through the 
crowd, anxiously looking for his friend. 

" Ah, here you are ! ' exclaimed a familiar voice. 

" My dear Kathie ! " 

The clasp and the smile were so fervent that they 
at once restored her spirits, for she was beginning to 
feel homesick. General Mackenzie drew her close 
with sheltering tenderness. 

" I have a carriage in waiting. Won't you come 
home with us, Winterdyne, and take a cup of tea ? 
I am more than obliged for all your kindness. It 
has been a dreary day for a journey." 

" Thank you, but I am late now to meet an engage- 
ment. Miss Kathie proved a very agreeable travel- 
ling companion, and I am happy to have done you 
ever so slight a service. Good night. I expect to 
see you both again." 

They soon rattled homeward. It was so delightful 
to be in a warm, cheerful room and have dear Aunt 
Euth's kisses of welcome, to slip out of her water- 



 

proof and lay aside her hat. She felt stiff and 
cramped, to be sure, but a few hours would rest 
her, and by morning she would be her olden self. 

It seemed, somehow, as if Aunt Ruth had changed. 
She was quite a stately lady, indeed, and looked very 
stylish in her black silk that trailed around her slen- 
der figure, and the soft lace at her neck and wrists. 
But the dear face was as sweet as ever. 

" O Aunt Euth," Kathie exclaimed, " have you been 
very, very happy ? You look so." 

" Of course she has, my little girl. Did you think 
an old gray-beard like me had lost the art of mak- 
ing people satisfied and content ? Why, I dare say I 
shall charm you so that you will never want to go 
back to Cedarwood. You don't half know how dan- 
gerous I am." 

Kathie laughed genially. How proud Aunt Euth 
must be of him, so manly and tender, and to have 
him all for her own ! 

" But you must not be starved, little Kathie," he 
said, ringing the bell. " Eailroad fare is not the most 
satisfactory of all feasting. We will have a cosey 
little tea to ourselves." 

Aunt Euth emptied the side-table and spread a 



 

snowy cloth over it. In a few moments the servant 
entered with a tray and arranged a dainty meal. 
Aunt Ruth poured the tea, and the General tempted 
Kathie with every delicacy, taking a taste himself to 
assure her that it was as good as it looked. They 
talked of the dear ones at Cedarwood, of letters and 
pleasures and kind remembrances, until Kathie began 
to feel weary and sleepy. 

Aunt Ruth had to make her a bed in the sitting- 
room, but the sofa was roomy, and fenced in with 
chairs to keep the blankets from slipping. 

" I thought you would feel more at home here with 
me in the next room, than in one of the distant 
chambers by yourself." 

" I shouldn't want to go very far from you in this 
strange country," said Kathie, with her good-night 
kiss.



 



CHAPTEE III. 

HOLIDAY JOYS. 

KATHIE'S feelings for the first few days reminded 
her of her early visit to New York. There were so 
many strange sights and strange faces, ladies talking 
to her upon the one hand and gentlemen upon the 
other. She understood quickly how General Mac- 
kenzie was loved and honored. No wonder Ada had 
felt so proud of his notice that first evening at the 
opera. How had she been so fearless ? 

She did not know that it was her own simple, 
truthful heart, so much sweeter and more attractive 
;haii all the world-polish that one can put on. For, 
although there may be much gilding and furbishing 
up and dazzling show that loudly demand the at- 
tention of passers by, the quieter grace and love- 
liness are not altogether forgotten. When the whole 
mass of mineral is crushed and fused, and the baser 
metals find their kindred attractions, a little quick- 




silver, you know, takes hold of the gold that has lain 
quietly amid all the smoke and bubbling, patiently 
biding its time. 

There was so much going and so much sight-seeing 
that Kathie declared her brain was like a rubbish 
room, and that it would take weeks to get it into 
order. There were the country's palaces and halls, 
which, lacking the storied beauty of London and 
Paris, had still some brave and touching associations 
of their own. To her inexperienced eyes they were 
still magnificent. 

A dozen times a day she said, " If Eob were only 
here," especially when they were going through the 
Treasury Department. General Mackenzie was the 
most charming guide imaginable. He seemed to 
know the history of everything, even that of many 
curiosities in the Patent Office, which somehow inter- 
ested Kathie wonderfully. But she liked best of all 
to linger in the rotunda of the capitol. The great 
dome so high above her, the panels with their pic- 
tures, always chained her with a peculiar charm. 
There was the " Landing of the Pilgrims," with beau- 
tiful Eose Standish listening with wondering girlish- 
ness to the hoary patriarch giving thanks for the safe 



 

ending of their perilous journey. How odd it seemed 
to think of now as only a few days' sail ! 

And there was the White House with its sturdy 
President. But Kathie couldn't help thinking of 
the other one, called to lay down his life for his 
country's sake just as the morn of peace had begun 
to dawn. And all the place seemed sacred to her for 
the many precious souls of heroes and martyrs who 
had risen up in the hour of need and done their duty 
nobly. 

There was a gay holiday side to it as well. To be 
sure, a great many of the members had gone to rejoin 
their families, but the streets were still thronged. 
The storm was succeeded by several bright, sunshiny 
days and a milder atmosphere. General Mackenzie 
drove to all the points of interest outside of Wash- 
ington, and described the appearance of it when it 
was a grand camping-ground bristling with tents 
and hospitals. 

Mr. Winterdyne did not forget Kathie, but looked 
in upon her several times, once bringing her some 
exquisite hot-house flowers. Then she went out to a 
number of grand dinners with Aunt Ruth and the 
General, and altogether it was quite a gala time. 

 



 

" Now you must see it in summer," General Mac- 
kenzie said. " Some time we will make another pil- 
grimage." 

The visit seemed both long and short to Kathie. 
The time had passed rapidly and every sense had 
been crowded to repletion, and yet it was only a 
night or two ago that Mr. Winterdyne had handed 
her out of the dimly lighted cars to her uncle's cordial 
welcome. Now she was being handed in again. 

The homeward journey was much more pleasant. 
No snowy shroud draped towns and villages and 
rivers. The crisp, keen air was wonderfully clear, 
and every distant tree or hill was outlined against 
the blue sky as if painted there. 

They spent the night in Philadelphia, to Kathie's 
great delight, and took the following morning to 
ramble round, not arriving at Mr. Meredith's until 
dusk of the next day. 

Jessie welcomed them both with smiles and kisses. 
" We thought you were never coming," she said. 
'* We had quite a little feast yesterday in honor of 
you, but to-day it inclines to fragments." 

" And I have been altogether superseded," declared 
Mr. Meredith. " The stars and bars and titles have 
won your heart, Kathie." 



 

" No, it isn't that " ; with an ingenuous blush. 
" And we talked of you while in Washington, and all 
the old times ; and O, I met a friend of yours when I 
went on, a Mr. Miller, who was present at your marriage." 



" Yes, he was here a few evenings since and told 
us. Kathie, you are quite a heroine." 

" I don't know what for," she said, simply. 

Mr. Meredith could have answered easily, but he 
did not wish to disturb the soft bloom of the peach 
before its midsummer ripening. It was her sweet 
unconsciousness of self, the bright, ready grace in 
ministering, that gave a beauty to the trifles of her 
daily life, and the spiritual correspondence back of 
it all. 

" And you have had a nice time ? " 

"It has been more than nice," returned Kathie; 
" delightful, and just crowded full of enjoyment." 

" Let them come up stairs and take off their wrap- 
pings," said matronly Jessie. " And Edward, if you 
will just call to Bridget, so that she can have things 
ready." 

Mr. Meredith made a most ridiculous face, as if to 
Kathie's sympathy. 





Jessie ran lightly up the stairs. The front room 
was a guest-chamber par excellence, and the folding- 
doors between this and her own room were thrown 
open. They looked so neat and pretty, with carpets 
of a soft rose-color and drab, and all the toilet mats 
embroidered with the same shades. The white cur- 
tains at the windows were plain muslin, with a bit 
of rose-color in the hems, while the ground-glass 
vases and scent-bottles were in purest white as well. 

" Why, it looks like a fairy palace," declared Ka- 
thie. " And O, here are some flowers ! " 

"You wouldn't believe what a pretty conservatory 
I have down in the back parlor. I could not give up 
every nook to furniture. And here is my sewing- 



room.' 



A little nest off of Jessie's apartment, just as cosey 
as it could be, with a pretty willow workstand and a 
sewing-machine. There were some brackets and pic- 
tures against the walls, the latter Jessie's handiwork. 

Aunt Ruth and Kathie had to inspect and admire 
everything. And here was another tiny vase of 
flowers. 

" I don't wart to fall into the mistake of putting 
every pretty article in iny parlor for chance visitors 



 

to inspect. I desire little bits of beauty for myself; 
and as I sit and sew here, and listen to birdie singing 
or see a stray flower blossom, I feel as if life was an 
every-day glory, and not detached fragments of pleas- 
ure that you have hard work to piece together, and 
are in a continual fever lest the joinings will show." 

" You are taking it up in the right way," said Aunt 
Ruth, with her sweet smile. " If we could all come 
to understand that the interior part of life, holding 
home and love, was so much more satisfying than 
outside show." 

" Are you never coming down ? The General and 
I are half starved to death. We shall have to reor- 
ganize the regiment and appoint a new quarter- 
master." 

They all marched down to the front basement, 
which served as dining-room. And even here Jes- 
sie's cunning hand was plainly visible. Bridget was 
quiet and tidy, and though her serving might not 
have had the grace of a French waiter, it was more 
lady-like than one might expect from a coarse-handed 
emigrant who had run wild and lived in the fields. 

The journey and its wonders had to be told over, 
and Kathie's thorough delight made it very enter 



 

taining. They sat a long while over their dessert, tor 
there seemed no hurry, as is often the case. 

" I have at last persuaded Bridget to eat her dinner 
as soon as she brings on the dessert. Sometimes she 
even goes so far as to wash up the dishes when we 
have company, and now she thinks it so much nicer 
than dawdling and hanging about," Jessie said to 
Aunt Euth. 

" Have you had much trouble ? " 

Jessie laughed. " Bridget gave me notice at the 
end of the first fortnight. She had never lived in a 
house where there wasn't a chambermaid, and she 
couldn't do so much work ; but I believe she thinks 
now that there is very little to do." 

" Jessie will soon be qualified to write ' What I 
know about Housekeeping, ' said Mr. Meredith, 
laughingly. 

"It will be very much needed," returned Aunt 
Euth. 

The gentlemen stayed down to smoke a little 
while, and Jessie took her guests back to the parlor. 
Kathie was tired and sleepy, and laid her hea<i in 
Aunt Euth's lap while the two ladies talked, "n- 
deed, she was really glad to go to bed. 



 

They spent most of the next day resting up. Mr. 
Meredith came home early and took them to the
