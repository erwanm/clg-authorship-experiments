house ; and then in quest of coolness he wandered away 
to the rocky ridge whence you looked across at the 
Jungfrau. To-day, however, the white summits were 
invisible ; their heads were muffled in sullen clouds, and 
the valleys beneath them curtained in dun-coloured mist. 
Rowland had a book in his pocket, and he took it out 
and opened it. But his page remained unturned ; his 
own thoughts were more absorbing. His interview with 
Christina Light had made a great impression upon him, 
and he was haunted with the memory of her almost 
blameless bitterness, and of all that was tragic and fatal 
in her latest transformation. These things were im 
mensely appealing, and Rowland thought with infinite 
impatience of Roderick 's having again become acquainted 
with them. It required little imagination to apprehend 



 

that the young sculptor 's condition had also appealed to 
Christina. His consummate indifference, his supreme 
defiance, would make him a magnificent trophy, and 
Christina had announced with sufficient distinctness that 
she had said good-bye to scruples. It was her fancy at 
present to treat the world as a garden of pleasure, and 
if hitherto she had played with Roderick 's passion on its 
stem, there was little doubt that now she would pluck it 
with an unfaltering hand and drain it of its acrid sweet 
ness. And why the deuce need Roderick have gone 
marching back to destruction ? Rowland 's meditations, 
even when they began in rancour, often brought him 
comfort ; but on this occasion they ushered in a quite 
peculiar quality of unrest. He felt conscious of a sudden 
collapse in his moral energy ; a current that had been 
flowing for two years with liquid strength seemed at last 
to pause and stagnate. Rowland looked away at the 
sallow vapours on the mountains ; their dreariness had 
an analogy with the stale residuum of his own generosity. 
At last he had arrived at the uttermost limit of the de 
ference a sane man might pay to other people 's folly ; 
nay, rather, he had transgressed it ; he had been befooled 
on a gigantic scale. He turned to his book and tried to 
woo back patience, but it gave him cold comfort, and he 
tossed it angrily away. He pulled his hat over his eyes 
and tried to wonder dispassionately whether atmospheric 
conditions had not something to do with his ill-humour. 
He remained some time in this attitude, but was finally 
aroused from it by a singular sense that although he had 
heard nothing some one had approached him. He 
looked up and saw Roderick standing before him on the 
turf. His mood made the spectacle unwelcome, and for 
a moment he felt like speaking roughly. Roderick stood 
looking at him with an expression of countenance which 
had of late become rare. There was an unfamiliar spark 
in his eye, and a certain imperious alertness in his car 
riage. Confirmed habit, with Rowland, came speedily 



 

to the front. "What is it now?" he asked himself, 
and invited Roderick to sit down. Roderick had evi 
dently something particular to say, and if he remained 
silent for a time it was not because he was ashamed of it. 

"I should like you to do me a favour," he said at 
last. " Lend me some money." 

" How much do you wish?" Rowland asked. 

" Say a thousand francs." 

Rowland hesitated a moment. I don 't wish to be 
indiscreet, but may I ask you what you propose to do 
with a thousand francs?" 

"To go to Interlaken." 

"And why are you going to Interlaken? 

Roderick replied, without a shadow of wavering, 
" Because that woman is to be there." 

Rowland burst out laughing, but Roderick remained 
serenely grave. "You have forgiven her, then?" said 
Rowland. 

"Not a bit of it !" 

"I don 't understand." 

"Neither do I. I only know that she is incompar 
ably beautiful, and that she has waked me up amazingly. 
Besides, she asked me to come." 

" She asked you?" 

"Yesterday, in so many words." 

" Ah, the shameless jade !" 

" Exactly. I am willing to take her for that." 

"Why, in the name of common sense, did you go 
back to her ?" 

"Why did I find her standing there like a goddess 
who had just stepped out of her cloud ? Why did I 
look at her ? Before I knew where I was the spell was 
wrought. " 

Rowland, who had been sitting erect, threw himself 
back on the grass and lay for some time staring up at 
the sky. At last, raising himself, "Are you perfectly 
serious?" he asked. 



 

"Deadly serious." 

"Your idea is to remain at Interlaken some time?" 

"Indefinitely !" said Roderick ; and it seemed to his 
companion that the tone in which he said this made it 
immensely well worth hearing. 

"And your mother and cousin meanwhile are to re 
main here ? It will soon be getting very cold, you know. " 

" It doesn 't seem much like it to-day." 

"Very true ; but to-day is a day by itself." 

" There is nothing to prevent their going back to 
Lucerne. I depend upon your taking charge of them. 

At this moment Rowland reclined upon the grass 
again ; and again after reflection he faced his friend. 
" How would you express," he asked, " the character of 
the profit that you expect to derive from your excursion ?" 

"I see no need of expressing it. The proof of the 
pudding is in the eating ! The case is simply this. I 
desire immensely to be near Christina Light, and it is 
such a huge refreshment to find myself again desiring 
something, that I propose to drift with the current. As 
I say, she has waked me up, and it is possible that 
something may come of it. She makes me feel as if I 
were alive again. This sort of thing," and he glanced 
down at the inn, " I call death !" 

"That I am very grateful to hear. You really feel as 
if you might do something?" 

" Don 't ask too much. I only know that she makes 
my heart beat, makes me see visions." 

" You feel encouraged ?" 

" I feel excited." 

"You are really looking better." 

" I am glad to hear it. Now that I have answered 
your questions, please to give me the money." 

Rowland shook his head. For that purpose I can't ! " 

"You can t?" 

"It 's impossible. Your plan is pure folly. I can't 
help you in it." 



 

Roderick flushed a little, and his eye expanded. "I 
will borrow what money I can, then, from Mary!" This 
was not viciously said ; it had simply the ring of passion 
ate resolution. 

Instantly it brought Rowland to terms. He took a 
bunch of keys from his pocket and tossed it upon the 
grass. " The little brass one opens my dressing-case," 
he said. " You will find money in it." 

Roderick let the keys lie ; something seemed to have 
struck him ; he looked askance at his friend. "You are 
awfully considerate of Mary ! " 

"You certainly are not. Your proposal is an out 
rage." 

Very likely. It 's proof the more of my desire. " 

" If you have so much steam on, then, use it for some 
thing else ! You say you are awake again. I am de 
lighted ; only be so in the best sense. Isn 't it very 
plain ? If you have the energy to desire, you have also 
the energy to reason and to judge. If you can care to 
go, you can also care to stay, and staying being the more 
profitable course, the inspiration, on that side, for a man 
who has his self-confidence to win back again, should be 
greater. " 

Roderick plainly did not relish this simple logic, and 
his eye grew angry as he listened to its echo. " Oh, 
the devil !" he cried. 

But Rowland gave him more of it. " Do you believe 
that hanging about Christina Light will do you any good? 
Do you believe it won't ? In either case you should keep 
away from her. If it won t, it 's your duty ; and if it will, 
you can get on without it." 

" Do me good ?" cried Roderick. " What do I want 
of good what should I do with good ? I want 
what she gives me, call it by what name you will. I 
want to ask no questions, but to take what comes and 
let it fill the impossible hours ! But I didn 't come to 
discuss the matter." 



 

"I have not the least desire to discuss it," said Row 
land. " I simply protest." 

Roderick meditated a moment "I have never yet 
thought twice about accepting any favour of you," he 
said at last ; " but this one sticks in my throat." 

"It is not a favour ; I lend you the money only under 
compulsion. " 

"Well, then, I will take it only under compulsion !" 
Roderick exclaimed. And he sprang up abruptly and 
marched away. 

His words were ambiguous ; Rowland lay on the grass 
wondering what they meant. Half an hour had not 
elapsed before Roderick reappeared, heated with rapid 
walking and wiping his forehead. He flung himself 
down, and looked at his friend with an eye which ex 
pressed something purer than bravado and yet baser than 
conviction. 

"I have done my best !" he said. "My mother is 
out of money ; she is expecting next week some circular 
notes from London. She had only ten francs in her 
pocket. Mary Garland gave me every sou she possessed 
in the world. It makes exactly thirty-four francs. That 's 
not enough." 

You asked Mary Garland?" cried Rowland. 
I asked her." 

And told her your purpose ?" 

: I named no names. But she knew ! " 

; What did she say ?" 

Not a syllable. She simply emptied her purse. " 

Rowland turned over and buried his face in his arms. 
He felt a movement of irrepressible elation, and he barely 
stifled a cry of joy. Now, surely, Roderick had shattered 
the last link in the chain that bound Mary to him, and 
after this she would be free ! . . . When he turned 
about again, Roderick was still sitting there, and he had 
not touched the keys which lay on the grass. 

"I don 't know what is the matter with me," said 



 

Roderick, "but I have an insurmountable aversion to 
taking your money." 

" The matter, I suppose, is that you have a grain of 
wisdom left." 

" No, it 's not that. It 's a kind of brute instinct. I 
find it extremely provoking ! " He sat there for some 
time with his head in his hands and his eyes on the 
ground. His lips were compressed, and he was evidently, 
in fact, in a state of high disgust. " You have succeeded 
in making this thing uncommonly unpleasant !" he ex 
claimed. 

"I am sorry," said Rowland, "but I can't see it in 
any other way." 

" That I believe, and I resent the range of your vision 
pretending to be the limit of my action. You can't feel 
for me or judge for me, and there are certain things you 
know nothing about. I have suffered, sir !" Roderick 
went on, with increasing emphasis and with the ring of 
his fine old Virginian pomposity in his tone. I have 
suffered damnable torments. Have I been such a placid, 
contented, comfortable man this last six months that 
when I find a chance to forget my misery I should take 
such pains not to profit by it ? You ask too much, for a 
man who himself has no occasion to play the hero. I 
don 't say that invidiously ; it 's your disposition, and you 
can't help it. But decidedly there are certain things you 
know nothing about." 

Rowland listened to this outbreak with open eyes, 
and Roderick, if he had been less intent upon his own 
eloquence, would probably have perceived that he turned 
pale. " These things what are they ?" Rowland asked. 

"They are women, principally, and what relates to 
women. Women for you, by what I can make out, 
mean nothing. You have no imagination no sensi 
bility, nothing to be touched !" 

"That 's a serious charge," said Rowland, gravely. 

" I don 't make it without proof!" 



 

"And what is your proof?" 

Roderick hesitated a moment. The way you treated 
Christina Light. I call that grossly obtuse." 

"Obtuse?" Rowland repeated, frowning. 

"Thick-skinned, beneath your good fortune." 

"My good fortune?" 

" There it is it 's all news to you ! You had pleased 
her. I don 't say she was dying of love for you, but she 
took a fancy to you." 

" We will let this pass !" said Rowland, after a silence. 

"Oh, I don 't insist. I have only her own word for 
it." 

" Her own word?" 

"You noticed, at least, I suppose, that she was not 
afraid to speak ! I never repeated it, not because I was 
jealous, but because I was curious to see how long your 
ignorance would last if it were left to itself. " 

" I frankly confess it would have lasted for ever. And 
yet I don 't consider that my insensibility is proved." 

"Oh, don 't say that," cried Roderick, " or I shall 
begin to suspect what I must do you the justice to say 
that I never have suspected that you too have a grain 
of conceit ! Upon my word, when I think of all this, 
your protest, as you call it, against my following Chris 
tina Light seems to me thoroughly offensive. There is 
something monstrous in a man 's pretending to lay down 
the law to a sort of emotion with which he is quite un 
acquainted in his asking a fellow to give up a lovely 
woman for conscience sake when he has never had the 
impulse to strike a blow for one for passion 's !" 

"Oh, oh !" cried Rowland. 

" It 's very easy to exclaim," Roderick went on ; "but 
you must remember that there are such things as nerves 
and senses and imagination and a restless demon within, 
that may sleep sometimes for a day, or for six months, 
but that sooner or later wakes up and thumps at your 
ribs till you listen to him ! If you can't understand it, 



 

take it on trust and let a poor visionary devil live his life 
as he can !" 

Roderick 's words seemed at first to Rowland like 
something heard in a dream ; it was impossible they had 
been actually spoken so supreme an expression were 
they of the insolence of egotism. Reality was never so 
consistent as that ! But Roderick sat there balancing 
his beautiful head, and the echoes of his strident accent 
still lingered along the half-muffled mountain-side. Row 
land suddenly felt that the cup of his chagrin was full to 
overflowing, and his long-gathered bitterness surged into 
the simple wholesome passion of anger for wasted kind 
ness. But he spoke without violence, and Roderick 
was probably at first far from measuring the force that 
lay beneath his words. 

"You are incredibly ungrateful," he said. "You are 
talking arrogant nonsense. What do you know about 
my senses and my imagination ? How do you know 
whether I have loved or suffered ? If I have held my 
tongue and not troubled you with my complaints, you 
find it the most natural thing in the world to put an 
ignoble construction on my silence ! I loved quite as 
well as you ; indeed I think I may say rather better. 
I have been constant. I have been willing to give more 
than I received. I have not forsaken one mistress because 
I thought another more beautiful, nor given up the other 
and believed all manner of evil about her because I had 
not my way with her. I have been a good friend to 
Christina Light, and it seems to me my friendship does 
her quite as much honour as your love ! " 

"Your love your suffering your silence your 
friendship!" cried Roderick. "I declare I don 't 
understand ! " 

"I daresay not. You are not used to understanding 
such things you are not used to hearing me talk of my 
feelings. You are altogether too much taken up with your 
own. Be as much so as you please ; I have always re- 



spected your right. Only when I have kept myself in 
durance on purpose to leave you an open field, don 't, by 
way of thanking me, come and call me an idiot." 

" Oh, you claim, then, that you have made sacrifices ?" 

" Several ! You have never suspected it?" 

" If I had, do you suppose I would have allowed it ?" 
cried Roderick. 

" They were the sacrifices of friendship, and they were 
easily made ; only I don 't enjoy having them thrown back 
in my teeth." 

This was under the circumstances a sufficiently generous 
speech ; but Roderick was not in the humour to take it 
generously. " Come, be more definite," he said. " Let 
me know where it is the shoe has pinched." 

Rowland frowned ; if Roderick would not take gener 
osity he should have full justice, "it 's a perpetual 
sacrifice to live with a transcendent egotist ! " 

* I am an egotist?" cried Roderick. 

"Did it never occur to you?" 

" An egotist to whom you have made perpetual sacri 
fices ? " He repeated the words in a singular tone ; a 
tone that denoted neither exactly indignation nor in 
credulity, but (strange as it may seem) a sudden violent 
curiosity for news about himself. 

"You are selfish," said Rowland; "you think only 
of yourself and believe only in yourself. You regard 
other people only as they play into your own hands. 
You have always been veiy frank about it, and the thing 
seemed so mixed up with the temper of your genius and 
the veiy structure of your mind that often one was willing 
to take the evil with the good and to be thankful that, 
considering your great talent, you were no worse. But 
if one believed in you as I have done one paid a tax on 
one 's faith ! " 

Roderick leaned his elbows on his knees, clasped his 
hands together and crossed them shadewise over his eyes. 
In this attitude for a moment he sat looking coldly at 



 

his friend. " So I have made you very uncomfortable?" 
he went on. 

" Extremely so." 

" I have been eager, grasping, obstinate, vain, ungrate 
ful, indifferent, cruel ? " 

"I have accused you mentally of all these things 
with the exception of vanity." 

"You have often hated me?" 

" Never. I should have parted company with you 
before coming to that." 

" But you have wanted to part company, to bid me go 
on my way and be hanged ? " 

" Repeatedly. Then I have had patience and forgiven 
you." 

Forgiven me, eh ? Suffering all the while ? " 

Yes, you may call it suffering. " 

"Why did you never tell me all this before?" 

" Because my affection was always stronger than my 
resentment ; because I preferred to err on the side of 
kindness ; because I had myself in a measure launched 
you in the world and thrown you among temptations ; 
and because nothing short of your unwarrantable aggres 
sion just now could have made me say these painful 
things." 

Roderick picked up a blade of long grass and began 
to bite it ; Rowland was puzzled by his expression and 
manner. They seemed strangely cynical ; there was 
something revolting in his deepening calmness. "I 
must have been hideous," Roderick presently resumed. 

" I am not talking for your entertainment," said Row 
land. 

" Of course not. For my edification ! " As Roderick 
said these words there was not a ray of warmth in his 
brilliant eye. 

" I have spoken for my own relief," Rowland went 
on, " and so that you need never again go so utterly 
astray as you have done this morning." 



"It has been a terrible mistake, then?" What his 
tone expressed was not wilful mockery, but a kind of 
persistent irresponsibility which Rowland found equally 
exasperating. He answered nothing. "And all this 
time," Roderick continued, "you have been in love? 
Tell me the woman." 

Rowland felt an immense desire to give him a visible 

palpable pang. " Her name is Mary Garland," he said. 

Apparently he succeeded. The surprise was great ; 

Roderick coloured as he had never done. " Mary 

Garland ? Heaven forgive us ! " 

Rowland observed the "us ;" Roderick threw himself 
back on the turf. The latter lay for some time staring 
at the sky. At last he sprang to his feet, and Rowland 
rose also, rejoicing keenly, it must be confessed, in his 
companion 's confusion. 

" For how long has this been ? " Roderick demanded. 

" Since I first knew her." 

" Two years ! And you have never told her ? " 

"Never." 

" You have told no one ? " 

"You are the first person." 

Why have you been silent ? " 

"Because of your engagement." 

" But you have done your best to keep that up." 

"That 's another matter !" 

"It 's very strange !" said Roderick presently. "It 's 
like something in a novel." 

"We needn 't expatiate on it," said Rowland. "All 
I wished to do was to rebut your charge that I am an 
abnormal being." 

But still Roderick pondered. "All these months, 
while I was going my way ! I wish you had mentioned 
it." 

" I acted as was necessary, and that 's the end of it." 

"You have a very high opinion of her?" 

"The highest." 



 

" I remember now your occasionally expressing it and 
my being struck with it. But I never dreamed you 
were in love with her. It 's a pity she doesn 't care for 
you !" 

Rowland had made his point, and he had no wish to 
prolong the conversation ; but he had a desire to hear 
more of this, and he remained silent. 

"You hope, I suppose, that some day she may?" 
Roderick asked. 

" I shouldn 't have offered to say so ; but since you 
ask me, I do." 

" I don 't believe it. She idolises me, and if she never 
were to see me again she would idolise my memory." 

This might be vivid insight and it might be profound 
fatuity. Rowland turned away ; he could not trust him 
self to speak. 

My indifference, my neglect of her, must have 
seemed to you horrible. Altogether I must have ap 
peared simply hideous." 

"Do you really care," Rowland asked, "what you 
appeared?" 

" Certainly. I have been damnably stupid. Isn 't an 
artist supposed to be a man of perceptions? I am 
hugely disgusted." 

"Well, you understand now, and we can start afresh." 

" And yet," said Roderick, " though you have suffered, 
in a degree, I don 't believe you have suffered so much 
as some other men would have done." 

"Very likely not. In such matters quantitative 
analysis is difficult." 

Roderick picked up his stick and stood looking at the 
ground. "Nevertheless, I must have seemed hideous," 
he repeated "hideous." He turned away frowning, 
and Rowland offered no contradiction. 

They were both silent for some time, and at last 
Roderick gave a heavy sigh and began to walk away, 
"Where are you going?" Rowland then asked. 



 

"Oh, I don 't care! To walk; you have given me 
something to think of." This seemed a salutary impulse, 
and yet Rowland felt a nameless perplexity. "To have 
been so stupid damns me more than anything ! " Roderick 
went on. " Certainly I can shut up shop now." 

Rowland felt in no smiling humour, and yet in spite 
of himself he could almost have smiled at the very con 
sistency of the fellow. It was egotism still aesthetic 
disgust at the graceless contour of his conduct, but never 
a hint of simple sorrow for the pain he had given. 
Rowland let him go, and for some moments stood watch 
ing him. Suddenly Rowland became conscious of a 
singular and most illogical impulse a desire to stop him, 
to have another word with him not to lose sight of 
him. He called him, and Roderick turned. " I should 
like to go with you," said Rowland. 

" I am fit only to be alone. I am damned !" 

"You had better not think of it at all," Rowland 
cried, "than think in that way." 

"There is only one way. I have been hideous!" 
And he broke off and marched away with his long elastic 
step, swinging his stick. Rowland watched him, and 
at the end of a moment called to him. Roderick stopped 
and looked at him in silence, and then abruptly turned 
and disappeared below the crest of a hill. 



XXVI. 

ROWLAND passed the remainder of the clay as best he 
could. He was half exasperated, half depressed ; he 
had an insufferable feeling of having been placed in the 
wrong in spite of his excellent cause. Roderick did not 
come home to lunch ; but of this, with his passion for 
brooding away the hours on far-off mountain-sides, he 



 

had almost made a habit. Mrs. Hudson appeared at 
the noonday repast with a face which showed that 
Roderick 's demand for money had unsealed the fountains 
of her distress. Little Singleton consumed an enormous 
and well-earned meal. Mary Garland, Rowland ob 
served, had not contributed her scanty assistance to her 
kinsman 's pursuit of the Princess Casamassima without 
an effort. The effort was visible in her pale face and 
her silence ; she looked so ill that when they left the 
table Rowland felt almost bound to remark upon it. 
They had come out upon the grass in front of the inn. 

" I have a headache," she said. And then suddenly, 
looking about at the menacing sky and motionless air, 
" It 's this horrible day !" 

Rowland that afternoon tried to write a letter to his 
cousin Cecilia, but his head and his heart wtre alike 
heavy, and he traced upon the paper but a single line. 
" I believe there is such a thing as being too reasonable. 
But when once the habit is formed, what is one to do?" 
He had occasion to use his keys, and he felt for them in 
his pockets ; they were missing, and he remembered that 
he had left them lying on the hill-top where he had had 
his talk with Roderick. He went forth in search of them, 
and found them where he had thrown them. He flung 
himself down in the same place again ; he felt indis 
posed to walk. He was conscious that his mood had 
greatly changed since the morning ; his extraordinary 
acute sense of his rights had been replaced by the familiar 
chronic sense of his duties. Only, his duties now seemed 
impracticable ; he turned over and buried his face in his 
arms. He lay so a long time, thinking of many things ; 
the sum of them all was that Roderick had beaten him. 
At last he was startled by an extraordinary sound ; it 
took him a moment to perceive that it was a portentous 
growl of thunder. He aroused himself and saw that 
the whole face of the sky had altered. The clouds that 
had hung motionless all day were moving from their 



 

stations, and getting into position for a battle. The 
wind was rising, the turbid vapours were growing dark 
and thick. It was a striking spectacle, but Rowland 
judged best to observe it briefly, as a storm was evidently 
imminent. He took his way down to the inn, and found 
Singleton still at his post, profiting by the last of the 
rapidly-failing light to finish his study, and yet at the same 
time taking rapid notes of the actual condition of the 
clouds. 

" We are going to have a most interesting storm ! " the 
little painter gleefully cried. "I should like awfully to 
do it." 

Rowland adjured him to pack up his tools and decamp, 
and repaired to the house. The air by this time had 
become tremendously dark, and the thunder was incessant 
and deafening ; in the midst of it the lightning flashed 
and vanished, like the treble shrilling upon the bass. 
The innkeeper and his servants had crowded to the door 
way and were looking at the scene with faces which 
seemed a proof that it was unprecedented. As Rowland 
approached, the group divided to let some one pass within, 
and Mrs. Hudson came forth, as white as a corpse and 
trembling in every limb. 

"My boy, my boy, where is my boy?" she cried. 
" Mr. Mallet, why are you here without him ? Bring 
him to me !" 

"Has no one seen Mr. Hudson?" Rowland asked of 
the others. " Has he not returned?" 

Each one shook his head and looked grave, and Row 
land attempted to reassure Mrs. Hudson by saying that 
of course he had taken refuge in a chalet. 

"Go and find him, go and find him !" she cried, in 
sanely. "Don 't stand there and talk, or I shall drop 
dead !" It was now as dark as evening, and Rowland 
could just distinguish the figure of Singleton scampering 
homeward with his box and easel. And where is 
Mary?" Mrs. Hudson went on; "what in mercy 's name 



 

has become of her? Mr. Mallet, why did you ever 
bring us here?" 

There came a prodigious flash of lightning, and the 
limitless tumult about them turned clearer than mid 
summer noonday. The brightness lasted long enough to 
enable Rowland to see a woman 's figure on the top of an 
eminence near the house. It was Mary Garland, ques 
tioning the lurid darkness for Roderick. Rowland sprang 
out to interrupt her vigil, but in a moment he met her 
coming back. He seized her hand and hurried her to 
the house, where, as soon as she stepped into the covered 
gallery, Mrs. Hudson fell upon her with frantic lament 
ations. 

"Did you see anything nothing?" she cried. "Tell 
Mr. Mallet he must go and find him, with some men, 
some lights, some wrappings. Go, go, go, sir ! In 
mercy, go !" 

Rowland was extremely perturbed by the poor lady 's 
vociferous folly, for he deemed her anxiety superfluous. 
He had offered his suggestion with sincerity ; nothing 
was more probable than that Roderick had found shelter 
in a herdsman 's cabin. These were numerous on the 
neighbouring mountains, and the storm had given fair 
warning of its approach. Mary stood there very pale, 
saying nothing, only looking at him. He expected that 
she would try to soothe her cousin. " Could you find 
him ?" she suddenly asked. " Would it be of use ?" 

The question seemed to him a flash intenser than the 
lightning that was raking in the sky before them. It 
shattered his dream that he weighed in the scale ! But 
before he could answer, the full fury of the storm was 
upon them ; the rain descended in sounding torrents. 
Every one fell back into the house. There had been no 
time to light lamps, and in the little uncarpeted parlour, 
in the unnatural darkness, Rowland felt Mary 's hand 
upon his arm. For a moment it had an eloquent pres 
sure ; it seemed to be a retractation of her senseless 



 

challenge, an assurance that she believed, for Roderick, 
what he believed. But nevertheless, thought Rowland, 
the cry had come, her heart had spoken ; her first im 
pulse had been to sacrifice him. He had been uncertain 
before ; here at least was the comfort of certainty ! 

It must be confessed, however, that the certainty in 
question did little to enliven the gloom of that formid 
able evening. There was a noisy crowd about him in 
the room noisy even with the accompaniment of the 
continual thunder-peals ; lodgers and servants, chatter 
ing, shuffling, bustling, annoying him equally by making 
too light of the tempest and by vociferating their alarm. 
In the disorder it was some time before a lamp was 
lighted, and the first thing he saw as it was swung from 
the ceiling was the white face of Mrs. Hudson, who was 
being carried out of the room in a swoon by two stout 
maid -servants, with Mary Garland forcing a passage. 
He rendered what help he could, but when they laid the 
poor woman on her bed Mary motioned him away. 

" I think you make her worse," she said. 

Rowland went to his own room. The partitions in 
Swiss mountain inns are thin, and from time to time he 
heard Mrs. Hudson moaning three doors off. Consider 
ing its  great fury, the storm took long to expend itself; 
it was upwards of three hours before the thunder ceased. 
But even then the rain continued to fall heavily, and the 
night, which had come on, was impenetrably black. 
This lasted till near midnight. Rowland thought of 
Mary Garland 's question in the porch, but he thought 
even more that, although the fetid interior of a high- 
nestling chalet may offer a convenient refuge from an 
Alpine tempest, there was no possible music in the 
universe so sweet as the sound of Roderick 's voice. At 
midnight, through his dripping window-pane, he saw a 
star, and he immediately went downstairs and out into 
the gallery. The rain had ceased, the cloud -masses 
were dissevered here and there, and several stars were 



 

visible. In a few minutes he heard a step behind him, 
and, turning, saw Mary Garland. He asked about Mrs. 
Hudson, and learned that she was sleeping, exhausted 
by her fruitless lamentations. Mary kept scanning the 
darkness, but she said nothing to cast doubt on Roderick 's 
having found a refuge. Rowland noticed it. "This also 
have I guaranteed !" he said to himself. There was 
something that Mary wished to learn, and a question 
presently revealed it. "What made him start on a long 
walk so suddenly?" she asked. "I saw him at eleven 
o clock, and then he meant to go to Engelberg and 
sleep." 

" On his way to Interlaken ! " Rowland said. 

"Yes," she answered, under cover of the darkness. 

"We had some talk," said Rowland, "and he seemed, 
for the day, to have given up Interlaken." 

" Did you dissuade him ?" 

" Not exactly. We discussed another question, which 
for the time superseded his plan." 

Mary was silent. Then "May I ask whether your 
discussion was violent?" she said. 

" I am afraid it was agreeable to neither of us." 

"And Roderick left you in in irritation?" 

" I offered him my company on his walk. He declined 
it." 

Mary paced slowly to the end of the gallery and then 
came back. "If he had gone to Engelberg," she said, 
"he would have reached the hotel before the storm 
began." 

Rowland felt a sudden explosion of ferocity. " Oh, 
if you like," he cried, "he can start for Interlaken as 
soon as he comes back !" 

But she did not even notice his anger. " Will he 
come back early?" she went on. 

" We may suppose so." 

" He will know how anxious we are, and he will start 
with the first light," said Maiy. 



 

Rowland was on the point of declaring that Roderick 's 
readiness to throw himself into the feelings of others 
made this extremely probable ; but he checked himself 
and said sknply, " I expect him at sunrise." 

Mary bent her eyes once more upon the irresponsive 
darkness, and then in silence went into the house. Row 
land, it must be averred, in spite of his resolution not to 
be nervous, found no sleep that night. When the early 
dawn began to tremble in the east he came forth again 
into the open air. The storm had completely cleared 
the atmosphere, and the day gave promise of cloudless 
splendour. Rowland watched the early sun-shafts slowly 
reaching higher, and remembered that if Roderick did 
not come back to breakfast there were two things to be 
taken into account. One was the heaviness of the soil 
on the mountain-sides, saturated with the rain, which 
would make him walk slowly ; the other was the fact 
that, speaking without irony, he was not remarkable for 
throwing himself into the sentiments of others. Break 
fast at the inn was early, and by breakfast-time Roderick 
had not reappeared. Then Rowland admitted that he 
was nervous. Neither Mrs. Hudson nor her companion 
had left their apartment ; Rowland had a mental vision 
of the two women sitting there looking at each other and 
listening ; he had no desire to see them more closely. 
There were a couple of men who hung about the inn as 
guides for going up the Titlis ; Rowland sent each of 
them forth in a different direction to ask for news of 
Roderick at every chalet door within a morning 's walk. 
Then he called Sam Singleton, whose peregrinations had 
made him an excellent mountaineer, and whose zeal and 
sympathy were now unbounded, and the two started 
together on a journey of research. By the time they had 
lost sight of the inn Rowland was obliged to confess that 
decidedly Roderick had had time to come back. 

He wandered about for several hours, but he found 
only the sunny stillness of the mountain-sides. Before 



 

long he parted company with Singleton, who, to his sug 
gestion that separation would multiply their powers, 
assented with a silent frightened look which reflected too 
vividly his own rapidly-dawning thought. The day was 
magnificent ; the sun was eveiywhere ; the storm had 
lashed the lower slopes into a deeper flush of autumnal 
colour, and the snow-peaks reared themselves against 
the near horizon in shining blocks and incisive peaks. 
Rowland made his way to several chalets, but most of 
them were empty. He thumped at their low foul doors 
with a kind of nervous savage anger ; he challenged the
