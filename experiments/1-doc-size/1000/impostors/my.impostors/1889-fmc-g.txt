mine.' His own words had a sententious sound in his ear and 
he felt that they were utterly inadequate, but he was fighting 
against heavy odds and did not know what to say. 

' I tell you that the child would die of a broken heart ! ' ex- 
claimed the baroness with the greatest conviction. * You say you 
love her, but you do not know her as I do. I suppose you will 
allow that it would be better that she should have moments of 
regret in a lifetime of happiness, than that she should die.' 

She was certainly using strong language, but the time was 
passing rapidly and in the distance she could distinguish already 
the grey towers of Sigmundskron crowning the beetling crag. 
She was to be pardoned if she seemed to exaggerate Hilda's danger, 
but she believed every word she spoke, and she was growing more 
and more nervous at every turn of the road. 

'If I believed that, if I even thought that were better for 
Hilda's happiness 

Greif left the sentence unfinished, for he felt that he was on 
the edge of the precipice, though he was still inwardly convinced 
that he was right and that she was wrong. The baroness thought 
the day was almost won. All her anger melted away in the 
prospect of success and she talked much and earnestly, dilating 





upon the situation and using every argument of persuasion which 
she could devise. But Greif said little, and though he was careful 
not to offend her afresh, he did not again come so near to com- 
mitting himself, as he had done once. 

'And for that matter,' said the baroness, as the carriage 
swung round the curve and began the last ascent that ended at 
the castle gate, ' for that matter, you can call yourself Sigmund- 
skron instead of Greifenstein.' 

Greif moved uneasily in his furs. It seemed as though every- 
thing were conspiring against him. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

HILDA'S quick eyes had discerned the carriage when it was still 
far down upon the road, a mere moving speck in the distance. 
She had thought it probable that her mother would return on that 
day, and she knew that she would be driven over from Greifenstein. 
Moreover, it was very likely that Greif would accompany her, and 
from the moment when she first saw the vehicle, she watched it 
and followed it along the winding road until she could clearly see 
that a man was seated beside her mother. Then the look of 
anxiety disappeared all at once from her fair face, and was 
followed by an expression of satisfied happiness which would have 
been good to see if any one had been there to watch her. 

She was standing upon a high part of the half-ruined building, 
on the northern side, and a person looking up from the road below 
could have seen her tall figure in strong relief against the pale 
winter sky. She had dressed herself all in black, but a wide mantle 
of coarse grey woollen stuff, gathered into a hood at the top and 
drawn tightly round her against the biting wind, concealed all her 
figure, leaving only her face visible. Rough and poor as the 
material was, it became her well, better perhaps than the richest 
furs could have done. Its folds fell gracefully to her feet as she 
held the cloak closely about her, and the unbroken neutral tint 
showed her height more plainly, and set off the marvellous beauty 
of her skin with a better contrast than any brighter colour. 

Sigmundskron had been very desolate and lonely during the 
last two days, since Hilda's mother had ridden away through the 
bitter night to do her duty in the house of death. Of course both 
Hilda and the faithful Berbel had their occupations as usual, and 
talked over them when they were together, but the time had 
passed slowly and heavily. Hilda could form no clear conception 
of what had taken place, from the confused account of the groom 
who had brought the news. The idea that her uncle Greifenstein 



 

and her aunt Clara were both dead, as well as another unknown 
gentleman who had been with them, was very dreadful; but 
Hilda knew so little of death, that the story seemed melancholy and 
weird to her imagination rather than ghastly and vivid with realised 
horror. By no effort of her mind could she fancy how the three 
looked, for she had never seen any one dead in her whole life. 
She had read of violent deeds in history, but they seemed more 
like ugly fairy stories than realities, and the tragedy of Greifenstein 
struck her in a very similar light. It was as though some strange 
evil genius had passed through the forest, scarce twenty miles from 
her home, destroying all that he found in his way. They were 
gone, suddenly, like the light of a candle extinguished, and she 
should never see them again. They had crossed the boundary 
into the wonderful land beyond, and perhaps from where they 
were now they could see her dreaming about them, and asking 
herself what that great change meant which only takes place once 
for each man and each woman in the world. Perhaps Hilda 
trembled at the heresy, but let her thoughts run on nevertheless, 
because after all it was only her imagination that was talking 
perhaps that was the end, and there was nothing beyond it. It 
would be infinitely horrible to be put out of existence altogether, 
without hope of any life at all afterwards. That might be what 
was meant by hell, and outer darkness, but upon this point Hilda 
was not decided. She made up her mind, however, after a little 
more reflexion, that the Greifensteins could not possibly have been 
bad enough to deserve to be put out entirely, though she frankly 
owned to herself that she had never liked her aunt Clara. She 
was sorry for her now, at all events, and she wished that she had 
at least made an effort to be more fond of her. 

Hilda tried to decide what she should say to Greif when she 
met him. She never doubted that he would come to Sigmund- 
skron, and in her ignorance of formalities she almost dared to hope 
that he would stay with her mother for a time. He would 
certainly not care to remain in Greifenstein for the present. If 
indeed he should wish to spend a few days with his relations, 
Hilda foresaw many and great difficulties, but she was surprised 
that such important household questions as those of bed and 
board for a possible guest should seem so insignificant when that 
guest was to be Greif himself. 

The real trouble lay in deciding what she should say. It was 
clear that she could not help looking pleased when he arrived, 
though it would be her duty to look somewhat sad and sorrowful. 
Of course she felt for him and he knew it, but he would perhaps 



 

expect her to show it very clearly in the first minute and would 
be hurt if she even smiled. It was not easy not to smile when 
she saw Greif after a long separation. Perhaps the best way to 
look very mournful would be to think that he could not marry 
her for a long time, now, on account of the mourning. But then, 
Greif had finished his studies and would henceforth be always at 
home, which in Hilda's opinion would be almost the same thing 
as being married, provided she could see him all the time. 

Then she thought of that strange warning she had given him 
when they last parted. She had not understood why she spoke, 
and yet she had not been able to keep silence. Surely this could 
not be what was meant. Besides, it was superstitious to believe 
in such things, and she had been thoughtless in yielding to the 
impulse. Greif was safe, at all events, and she supposed that 
everybody's parents must die some day, though not necessarily in 
such a strange way. Her own father had been killed, too, before 
she could know him if she had known him, she would have loved 
him, as Greif had loved the old gentleman who was now dead. 

Hilda became aware that her reflexions were growing more and 
more heartless and that they did not help her at all, especially as 
she could not communicate them to Berbel. She resolved not to 
reflect any more for the present, and applied herself diligently 
to her household occupations until the morning on which she 
expected her mother to return. And now she was not to be alone 
any longer, for the carriage was advancing up the hill and she could 
plainly see Greif sitting beside the baroness in the big carriage. 
She knew his fur cap, for it was the same he had worn last year. 
She gazed a few moments longer at the pair, regretting that she 
must be thought heartless if she waved her handkerchief as a signal 
of welcome, and then she swiftly descended the broken steps that 
led down into the house, closing as well as she could the crazy door 
of the turret, to keep out at least a little of the strong north wind. 

'Berbel! Berbel! Mamma is coming with Herr Greif!' she 
cried, before she was really within hearing of the room where 
Berbel was at work. 

Her clear voice rang through the stone passages before her as 
she ran on, repeating the news until Berbel answered her at last. 

' Is there anything for dinner ? ' asked Hilda breathlessly, as she 
stood in the doorway. 

The grey-haired woman looked up from her sewing, over her 
horn -rimmed glasses. She had a hard, good face, with rough 
brows, sharp eyes and a large mole upon her chin. She was 
spotlessly clean, and everything about her was supernaturally neat. 





 

She was broad-shouldered, rather bony than otherwise, and she 
moved as though nothing were any trouble which merely required 
exertion. 

' There are potatoes/ she answered laconically, but a strangely 
genial, half comical little smile was twitching at the corners of her 
solid mouth. 

' Nothing else ? Oh, Berbel, there must be something else ! ' 
Hilda's voice was full of a sudden distress, and her face exhibited 
considerable dismay. 

' I shall find something,' replied the other. ' Better see first 
whether they are hungry. Poor Herr Greif will not eat much 

' No but only potatoes, Berbel ! ' 

'Potatoe dumplings are good things,' observed the woman. 
' And fried potatoes with a stewed hare are better,' she added after 
a pause. 

' Is there a hare, then ? Oh, Berbel, you dear old thing, how 
could you frighten me in that way ! Where did you get it ? We 
have not had one for ever so long ! ' 

'Wastei,' answered Berbel. Being interpreted, the name 
signifies Sebastian. 

' And Wastei must have got it by poaching Hilda's face 
fell. 

'No the forester has given him a licence this year, and I 
mended his breeches. There you have the whole history.' 

Hilda's spirits revived immediately and she broke into a merry 
laugh, just as the sound of the horses' bells was heard jingling in 
castle-yard below the window. She ran down the stairs to meet 
her mother and Greif. The story of the hare and Wastei's breeches 
had almost chased away her good intentions to look appropriately 
sad. The hideous tragedy of the Greifensteins was very far from 
her simple young life. 

The great carriage swung round and drew up before the door 
of the hall, and Hilda was already standing upon the low steps. 
She had thrown back her hood when she had descended from the 
battlements, and had not replaced it. Her glorious hair looked 
like bright gold against the darkness of the hall behind her, and 
as the cloak fell from her on each side, the black of her dress 
suddenly threw out by contrast the brilliancy of her face. In 
another moment her mother and she were clasped in each other's 
arms, while Greif stood beside them on the steps. 

He closed his eyes for an instant, just as hers were turning 
toward him. This was the woman he had come to renounce, 
this was she whose love he could put away at a moment's notice 



 

for the sake of an idea his heart beat violently and then stood 
still, so that he turned very pale. Her hand was already in his, 
and he scarcely dared to look at her. 

' Greif are you ill ? ' she asked anxiously. 

He had not seen her smile. He had escaped that, he thought. 
But as he looked up he saw what was harder to bear than any 
look of joy at his coming. She, who never used to change colour, 
was pale to the lips, and in her eyes was a look of terror for him 
which betrayed all her love, and devotion and power of suffering 
for him, in the flash of an instant. She had indeed been terrified, 
for he had turned ashy white as he closed his eyes, and his figure 
had swayed a little unsteadily as though he had been about to 
fall. 

'Are you ill, Greif?' she repeated, unconsciously drawing him 
nearer to her. 

' It is nothing. My head turned for a moment,' he said. 

Hilda was not satisfied, but she saw that whatever had been 
the matter, he had recovered himself for the present, at least, and 
she supposed that he was exhausted with the fatigue and grief 
which had filled the last days. She became silent and preoccupied, 
as they all entered the hall together and ascended the steps to the 
sunny sitting-room over the court. Then Frau von Sigmundskron 
left her alone with Greif, on pretence of taking off her mantle and 
smoothing her hair, but as she went away she gave him a look 
which signified that she would not disturb them for some time. 

There was the great stone chimney-piece, just as Greif had seen 
it in his vision of the meeting, and Hilda sat down beside it, as he 
had fancied that she would. But the room was not cold, as he 
had anticipated, for the fire was clear and big, and the sun streamed 
brightly in through the southern window. He had imagined the 
place chill and dreary, for he knew that he should need the im- 
pression of dreariness to help him. Instead, it was warm and 
sunny, and though Hilda was still a little pale, her pallor did not 
produce the effect he had expected. He tried to begin, for in spite 
of all, his resolution was still unbroken, but the words stuck in his 
throat. 

' Greif,' said Hilda, looking up suddenly into his face. ' I do 
not know how to tell you I am so sorry, so sorry for you, dear. 
I have not the words, but it is all in my heart. You understand, 
do you not ? ' 

She had risen, seeing that he was still standing, and she came 
to him, and clasped both her hands upon his shoulder and looked 
up into his eyes. It would have been easier if she had begun in 



 

any other way than that. With her touch upon him, her eyes on 
his, her breath and soft voice so near, he could not play coldness. 
But he was strong still. 

His arms went round her swiftly and pressed her to him, and 
he kissed her as he had never kissed her before, three times in 
quick succession. Then he gently led her back to her chair and 
returned to his own place, standing as he had meant to do, to give 
himself more courage. She submitted wonderingly, without under- 
standing why he made her sit down, and for a few seconds neither 
spoke. At last he turned away from her and began to talk, look- 
ing at the window to avoid her eyes. 

' Hilda, a very terrible thing has happened, and I must explain 
it to you, in order that you may comprehend what I must do. 
Will you promise me to listen patiently and to forgive me before- 
hand for all I am going to say 2 ' 

'Yes,' answered the young girl rather faintly. The strong 
presentiment of evil had come upon her again, as it had come that 
day when he was leaving Greifenstein. She bent her head and 
covered her eyes with her hand, as though not to see the blow that 
was to descend, though she must feel its weight. It was all 
instinctive, for not the faintest thought of what he was going to 
say could ever have suggested itself to her mind. 

' Yes,' said Greif, ' it is very terrible. But I have come here 
to say it and I must say it all. You know what has happened. 
My poor mother is dead, and those who murdered her, have killed 
themselves my father and his half-brother. You did not know 
that I had an uncle ? ' 

Hilda shook her head, looking up for a moment. 

' He was a bad man, too,' continued Greif. * He had been an 
officer and had betrayed his trust in the times of revolution, 
was sentenced and imprisoned ; he escaped from the fortress, made 
his way to South America, and lived there for forty years in 
exile, until the amnesty was proclaimed. He was not Greifenstein, 
he was Rieseneck, half-brother to my father by the mother's side 
and younger than he. That was bad enough, however. It was 
the reason why my father lived here in the forest so quietly. He 
was afraid that people would remember he was Rieseneck's brother. 
You see, the affair made a great noise at the time. Your mother 
knows all about it. Well, it was hard enough, as I say, to have 
such a disgrace in the family. We did not know that Rieseneck 
had a son I found that my best friend his name is Rex is he.' 

' How strange ! ' exclaimed Hilda. ' Why is his name Rex ? ' 

' It is not, exactly. He and his father called themselves so in 



 

order not to be identified. It was almost necessary for them as 
it may be for me now.' 

' For you ? ' asked Hilda in the utmost astonishment. ' You 
would change your name why ? ' 

Greif stared at her. She seemed not to understand at all, and 
yet he had gone into Rieseneck's story merely to make his own 
seem more terrible by comparison. 

' You must know that, in the world, such calamities as have 
befallen me leave a mark, a stain even upon the innocent,' said 
Greif. ' The world looks askance at the sons of murderers.' 

' And are you afraid of the world, Greif,' asked Hilda. ' That 
is not like you. For the Riesenecks, well, I understand he 
was disgraced, condemned, imprisoned. But you ! It is like a 
dreadful story of the dark ages, but there is no shame in it, 
nothing to be ashamed of. It is terrible, awful, appalling, but 
you can hold your head as high as any one. Do you suppose it is 
the first tragedy that ever occurred in your family or in mine ? 
Did not old Sigmund strangle his own brother with his hands, 
here in this house, seven hundred years ago, and am I ashamed to 
call him my forefather ? ' 

'That is very different from what has happened to me,' 
answered Greif. ' You cannot understand, but the world judges 
according to its light. If I, the son of a man who murdered his 
wife and killed himself, were to present myself to any man of my 
own rank and ask him for his daughter in marriage I should 
receive a refusal, and perhaps an indignant one. I am not considered 
a fit person to marry an innocent girl of my class, I am stamped with 
a stained name, branded with the sign of others' crimes, ruined 
before my life is begun, cut off from happiness, from ambition, 
from you Hilda ! that is what I came to tell you I have 
spoken very badly it is best to say it clearly. My beloved, this 
has taken you from me, and me from you, and has cast me adrift 
from all that remained, from the greatest and best of all. If I 
could dare to marry you now, to give you my miserable name, to 
take you to the home that is darkened by so many deaths I 
should be the last and lowest of men ! It is of no use, for I feel 
it the only honourable thing left for me to do, in so much 
dishonour, is to leave you for ever and at once. If I were willing 
still to make you my wife you ought to despise me, and trample 
the memory of my love under foot as a vile thing. Hilda, 
Hilda ! it is death to me, but it is best for you.' 

The blow had fallen, and Hilda sat quite still in her place, 
covering her eyes with one hand, as she had done at first. All 



 

through his long preamble, she had felt that there was something 
dreadful to come, and now it had come indeed, in the shape she 
least expected, in the shape which of all others she would most 
have feared. She did not move, but the soft, fresh colour faded 
from her face, till it was whiter than the white hand she held 
before it. Greif looked at her, and his head swam. He thought 
neither of her suffering nor of his own, as the words came fast and 
incoherent from his pale lips. He went on, insisting, repeating, 
lamenting with the vehemence of a passionate man who has over- 
come all that is gentlest in himself and takes a savage delight in 
rending his own wounds. 

' It is done, and you know, now/ he cried bitterly. ' I have 
fought against myself, against every one, to do this thing do you 
think it is easy to give up such a love as you have been to me ? 
And yet, I would not take you, no, not if you pursued me across 
the world what right have I to you ? The right of loving better 
than anything God has made was ever loved before ? It is gone, 
that right, gone with my name, gone with all I once was, buried 
with my father and my mother in the old place beyond Greifenstein. 
Right ? I have no rights any longer neither to love, nor to hate, 
nor to be happy in the thought of love, nor of Hilda. And yet, 
in all the years to come, you will be with me. I cannot give up 
the right to remember you, and to think of your dear eyes. Ah, 
if it were but my own fault, how easy it would be to bear ! I 
wish I had wronged you you would thrust me from you it 
would help me at least, if I had done you harm, I could die for 
it, and that would be so easy arid simple, and would end all so well. 
I wish I had done some hideous, nameless deed with my own hands, 
that I might be driven out by men, and forced to leave you by 
others stronger than I ! Anything, anything, anything but this ! ' 

He bent his head against the cold stones of the high chimney- 
piece, and beat his brow against the hewn carvings of it, closing 
his eyelids over his dry and smarting eyes, wishing that every 
moment might be the last of his wretched existence, and at the 
same time miserably conscious that his strength would outlast all 
his sufferings. He had meant to be so calm and gentle, he had 
planned how he would gradually explain all to Hilda and break 
the shock for her, he had thought that when it was over, he could 
firmly say one solemn good-bye, and go back to his home alone. 
He had not known what love could do, nor how he should be 
tortured and wounded and bruised in the conflict. But yet he was 
strong and victorious. His dignity and self-respect had been sorely 
shaken in the fight, and he had not found the calm and tactful 



 

speeches he had planned before j but in spite of every one, and 
chiefly in spite of his own heart, he had bravely done what he had 
come to do. The victory was more agonising than any defeat 
could have been, but it was victory, notwithstanding. 

Manlike, in his utmost distress, he had forgotten Hilda's self 
in the overwhelming thoughts of her that rushed through his 
confused brain. Her hands had fallen upon her knee and she sat 
like a statue in the deep old chair, whiter than any marble, her 
colourless lips parted, her wonderful eyes fixed upon him in a 
glassy stare. Even her hair seemed to have lost its golden sheen, 
as though it were suddenly dead or turning into stone. And yet 
she was not unconscious. A very strong and perfect organisation 
rarely breaks down under the first shock it receives, no matter 
how violent. Hilda was not only conscious, she was even able to 
speak. 

' Greif ! ' She spoke his name clearly, in a low voice. 

He started, for he had almost forgotten her presence. He lifted 
his haggard face and turned towards her, supporting himself with 
one hand on the chimney-piece. 

' Do you mean all you have said ? ' she asked very slowly, as 
though each word cost her an effort. 

' I mean it all, Hilda,' he answered, his tones still trembling 
with the violence of the storm that had passed through him. 

'You mean that because your father did this deed, you are 
ashamed to marry me ?' 

' More than ashamed ' 

' And you will go away and leave me for ever, for the sake of 
this idea alone ? ' 

' Ah, Hilda you have not understood ' 

' I have understood all, because I love you, and now I know 
that you love me with all your heart 

' Oh, thank you, my beloved ! God bless you for seeing the 
truth 

' Do not thank me ' 

She caught her breath, then with a swift movement she was 
on her feet, standing beside him. The glassy stare was gone from 
her eyes, and they shone with a blue light like fire. Her strong 
white hands suddenly laid hold of his wrists and held him firmly. 

' Do not thank me, Greif or thank me, if you will as you 
please. I will not let you go.' 

There was a power in her tone which struck him with amaze- 
ment, a concentrated, unrelenting, almost furious energy that 
startled him. He had expected tears, protestations, laments ; 



 

he had thought that she might faint away, that the sight of her 
sufferings would treble his own. But he had not expected the 
short sharp outburst of a passion as strong as his, or stronger, he 
had not foreseen or guessed that this simple girl, brought up so far 
from the world, would take him by the hands and hold him, and 
tell him that she would not let him go, with an accent of determin- 
ation that might have staggered the strongest man. 

' You will not ?' he exclaimed, aghast at the prospect of a battle 
worse than the first. 

' No,' she answered, still grasping his wrists and gazing into 
his face with her fiery eyes. ' I will not, and I know that I am 
strong. I feel it.' 

During nearly a minute neither spoke, but Hilda's hold did 
not relax for a second, and her lids did not once veil the intensity 
of her look. Even if Greif had possessed a wider experience of 
women than he had, it would not have helped him much. He was 
utterly at a loss. His manly nature would have provided him 
with weapons to rid himself of a woman of coarser instincts, even 
if he had loved her to distraction, provided he had felt that he 
must part from her. He would have felt that he could dominate 
a baser affection and force it down to his will, by sheer strength 
of purpose, no matter at what cost ; but he was met here by some- 
thing he had never understood, and he did not know what to do. 
The childlike innocence of Hilda's maiden love gave an extraordi- 
nary character to her passion. The absence of anything like the 
common expressions of love made the transcendent power of what 
moved her stand out in magnificent grandeur. Never in his 
life had he dreamt that her quiet and undemonstrative affection 
was capable of anything but a calm and beautiful development. 
He had not guessed the existence of such resistless force as blazed 
from her eyes, he had believed her only capable of receiving, he 
had not imagined that she was strong enough to take boldly what 
was refused her. The radiance of a spotless soul, burning in the 
white -heat of a passion as pure as itself, dazzled and awed him. 
As he looked, he felt as though he were held in the grasp of a 
splendid, wrathful angel, who disputed the possession of him, not 
with himself, but with the opposing powers of evil. 

It is amazing that in such a case he should still have found 
strength and courage to resist this last great trial of his sincerity. 
Most men would have yielded and would have accepted their fate. 
But though Greif was young, and not very wise, he had stern and 
obstinate blood in his veins, and he was acting under the strongest 
conviction that had ever possessed him. Knowing her only as he 



 

had known her before, the fair and innocent idol of his boyish heart, 
he had felt that he could never allow her to take his darkened 
name. In the beginning his intention had been very honourable, 
in his struggle with himself it had grown high and chivalrous, 
but in the face of such opposition as he met from her mother and 
now from herself, it had assumed proportions that bordered upon 
the grotesque. And yet as he looked now upon her noble face, 
illuminated and radiant with a beauty almost too pure for him to 
understand, he felt even more than before that such a creature 
could never be allowed to ally herself with one whose name was 
a reproach among men. He did not know how to oppose her, 
but he knew that she must be opposed, at any cost, for her own 
sake. 

His eyes fell before her gaze, and his hands trembled nervously 
in her grasp, so that she began to think that he was yielding, 
whereas he was in reality making a supreme effort to concentrate 
his courage and to keep the mastery of himself. While he seemed 
to be sinking to her will, he was gathering his strength, saying 
in his heart that if he lost this battle he should never hold up his 
head again. 

The sun streamed broadly through the diamond panes of the 
casement upon the patched and faded carpet, creeping slowly along 
his accustomed path in which the hours were marked, as on a dial, 
by threadbare seams and the leaves and flowers of a half-obliterated 
design. In the huge chimney the logs burned steadily with a 
low, roaring sound, and the shabby furniture of the place seemed 
to doze lazily in the warmth, as old men do whose strength is far 
spent. And in the midst of the commonplace scene a drama was 
being enacted, less horrible in outward appearance than the tragedy 
of Greifenstein, but scarcely less fearful to the two young hearts 
that beat so fiercely and full of life. 

The sunlight moved but a very little, as far as would show the 
passing of a minute, perhaps, and then Greif looked up once more 
and again met the gaze of Hilda's eyes. 



CHAPTER XIX 

' HILDA, I will die for you, but I cannot marry you.' Greif spoke 
quietly, but with the utmost decision. 

' I have said that I will not let you go,' she answered, 'and I 
will not. You are my life, and I will not die I should if you 
left me.' 

' You will forget me,' he said. 

' Forget you ! ' Her voice rang through the room. She dropped 
his hands with a passionate gesture and turned away from him, 
making one or two steps towards the window. Then she came 
back and stood before him. 

' Forget you ! ' she exclaimed again. ' You do not know what 
you are saying. You do not know me, if you can say it. Do you 
think, because I am a girl, that I am weak ? I tell you I am 
stronger than you, and I tell you that you are mad. Do you 
think that if I would have shed the last drop of my blood to save 
you from pain yesterday, I love you less to-day ? I love you a 
thousand times more for what you would do, but you shall not do 
it. I love you as no woman can love, who has not lived long 
life. And you say that you can go away, and that I shall forget 
you ! As I am a Christian woman, if I forget you, may God 
forget me, now and in the hour of death ! I could not if I would. 
And you say that you will leave me for what ? Because your 
father has done a terrible deed, and has taken his own life. For a 
name for a nothing else ! What is a name to me, compared 
with you yourself? I love you so, that if you had yourself done the 
most monstrous crime, I would not leave you, not if we were to 
die a shameful death together. And you would leave me, for my 
own good ! For my advantage oh, I would not have heaven 
itself without you. Forget ! What would there be left to 
remember, if you were taken ? The emptiness of the place where 
you were, the wide emptiness that all heaven could never fill ! 



 

Your name do you love it better than me ? But I know that 
you love me, though you are mad. Then put your name away, 
cast it from you to whomsoever will have it. Do you think 
that Hilda von Sigmundskron cares for names, or wants new ones ? 
Am I a peasant's child, to sigh for a coronet and to give you up 
because you have put it off ? Be what you will, you are only 
Greif to me, and Greif, only, means more to me than heaven or 
earth and all that are in them. You shake your head what 
would you say ? That it is not true ? My love needs no oaths to 
bind it, nor to prove it. You can see it in my face, for I know 
that it is there. Yes you cannot meet my eyes honest as you 
are, and good, and noble, and true-hearted as any man that ever 
drew breath. Do you know why ? You dare not you who dare 
anything else. I love you the more for having dared this but 
you shall not do it. I will not let you go, I will not, never, 
never ! ' 

Greif had turned his head away and stood leaning against the 
chimney almost in the same attitude he had taken from the first. 
She had spoken quickly and passionately and he had not been able 
to answer anything she said, for she did not pause, replying her- 
self to the questions she asked and giving him no time to oppose 
her. 

' I was wrong,' he said, half bitterly, half tenderly. ' You will 
not forget me any more than I can forget you. It will make it 
harder to say good-bye.' 

' It shall never be said, until one of us two is dying, Greif.' 

' We cannot change our fate, though we love ever so dearly,' he 
answered. 'Think, Hilda, if you took me as I am, what you 
might suffer in after years, what our children would surely suffer 
when they went out into the world, and the world began to whisper 
that they were the grandsons of that Greifenstein ' 

' What is the world to us, dear ? And as for our sons, if God 
sends us any, I know that if they grow up to be brave gentlemen, 
loyal and true, the world will leave them in peace.' 

' The world is a hard place 

' Then why have anything to do with it ? I have been happy, 
here in the forest, for so many years could you not be happy here 
with me ? ' 

'I should still be my father's son I should still be Greif- 
enstein.' 

' Would I have you anything else ? ' 

' Hilda, it is impossible ! ' cried Greif with suddenly renewed 
energy. ' I have said all. Must I say it again ? ' 



 

' If you were to say it a thousand times, it would not make it 
more true. But I will listen to all you tell me, if you like.' 

With a calmness that showed how certain she felt of her victory, 
Hilda resumed her seat at the opposite side of the fireplace, folded 
her hands together, and leaning her head against the back of the 
easy-chair, watched him with half-closed eyes. She was not tired, 
and would very probably be able to sustain the contest longer than 
he. After the first shock of the announcement was over, under 
which she had suffered more in one moment than would have 
sufficed to fill a week with agonising pain, the strong impulse to 
hold him had come upon her and her elastic strength had been 
roused to its fullest energy. But the memory of that one moment 
of agony was enough to make her guess what she would feel if he 
left her. 

Arguments repeated a second time rarely seem so forcible as 
when they are first heard. Painfully and conscientiously Greif 
recapitulated his reasons, trying to speak coldly and concisely, 
exerting himself to the utmost and summoning all the skill he could 
command in order to state his case convincingly. Hilda could not 
have put the idea that possessed him to a more cruel test than this. 
It began to dawn even upon himself that he was in pursuit of a 
chimera, and the necessity for the enormous self-sacrifice, upon 
which he insisted, was breaking down in the face of such a 
determined opposition on the part of those who were more interested 
than himself. Doggedly and persistently he continued, neverthe- 
less, fighting his love as though it had been a devil, thrusting 
Hilda's from his thoughts as though it had been an evil temptation, 
savagely determined not to part with his belief in what he took for 
his duty. It was a strange sight, and would have afforded material 
for reflexion to an older and wiser person than Hilda. 

' That is all I have to say,' he concluded. ' It seems to me 
that I cannot say it more clearly. You know what it costs me to 
repeat it all.' 

An expression of intense pain passed over his face, and he turned 
away in order to hide it from Hilda. He was hardly able to 
make his strained lips pronounce the last words. 

'I am not convinced,' said Hilda after a moment's pause. 'No 
eloquence in the world would convince me that you and I should 
sacrifice our lives for an idea, merely to save ourselves from the 
possibility of a few ill-natured remarks hereafter. That is all it 
comes to in the end. I will tell you the history of this idea.' 

She seemed calmer than ever, but the light had not faded from 
her eyes, and Greif felt that she was ready to spring upon him in 



 

an instant, to grasp his hands in hers and to say again that she 
would not let him go. He glanced nervously towards her, and the 
look of suffering returned to his face. 

'The history is this,' she said. 'When the dreadful thing 
happened, you thought of me. Then it seemed to you that you 
should free me from our engagement. That seemed hard to you, 
because you love me so much it was so hard that it took all your 
strength to make the resolution. You have spoken to my mother 
and to me. Now, I ask you whether my mother, at least, is not 
old enough to judge what is right ? Did she agree with you, and 
tell you that you should give me up ? ' 

' No she did all she could to persuade me ' 

'Of course,' interrupted Hilda. 'Of course she did. Now 
shall I tell you why you will not allow yourself to be persuaded, 
and why you insist on ruining your life as well as mine ? ' 

She rose again, gently this time, and came and stood beside 
him. He turned his head away as though it hurt him, and as she 
spoke she could see only his short, bright curling hair. 

' You will not be persuaded, because it was so hard for you to 
make the resolution at first, that you believe it must be right in 
spite of every other right, and you would sacrifice yourself and me 
for an idea which is strong only because it hurt you to accept it 
at first. Everything you have done and said is brave, noble, 
generous but you have gone too far you have lost sight of the 
true truth in pursuing a truth that was true yesterday. It never 
was your duty to do more than offer to set me free. And as for 
the name, Greif dear, I have heard that such things are done 
would you, if it pleases you that is, if it would help you to forget 
would you take mine, darling, instead of letting me take yours ? 
Perhaps it would make it easier you are only Greif to me, but 
perhaps if you could be Greif Sigmundskron to yourself, and live 
here, and never go to Greifenstein nor think of it again perhaps, 
my beloved, I could help you to forget it all, to the very name 
that pains you so.' 

She laid her hand upon his shoulder and pressed her cheek softly 
against his curls as she spoke the last words, though she could not 
see his face. The accents were so .low and tender that her voice 
sounded like soft music breathed into his ear. 

' No no ! I must never do it !' he tried to say, but the words 
were very indistinct. 

Hilda felt him move nervously, and she saw that he was 
grasping the chimney-piece with*both hands as though to support 
himself by it. In another moment his broad shoulders seemed to 



 

heave and then shrink together. He staggered and almost fell to 
the ground, though Hilda did her best to hold him. With a great 
effort he gained the chair in which she had sat and fell back in it. 
His eyes were closed and the lids were blue, while his tightly 
compressed lips moved as though he were biting them. 

Hilda knelt beside him and took his cold hands. The colour 
was all gone from her face, for she was terribly frightened. 

' Greif, Greif ! ' she cried in anguish. ' What is it, my beloved ? 
Speak, darling do not look like that ! ' 

'I am in great pain,' he answered, not opening his eyes, but 
faintly trying to press her fingers. 

She saw that he was ill, and that his suffering had nothing to 
do with his previous emotion. She opened the door quickly and 
called for help. Her mother's room was very near and Frau von 
Sigmundskron appeared immediately. 

'Greif is ill dying perhaps !' exclaimed Hilda dragging her 
into the little sitting-room to the young man's side. 

The baroness leaned over him anxiously, and at the touch of a 
strange hand his purple lids opened slowly and he looked up into 
her face. 

' It is in my head in the back,' he succeeded in saying. 

Greif had fallen in harness, fighting his battle with the morbid 
energy of a man already ill. To the very end he had held his 
position, resisting even that last tender appeal Hilda had made to 
him, but the strain upon his nerves had been too great. He was 
strong, indeed, but he was young and not yet toughened into that 
strange material of which men of the world are made. The loss 
of sleep, the deadly impression made upon him by the death of his 
father and mother, the terrible struggle he had sustained with 
himself, all had combined together to bring about the crisis. At 
first it was but a shooting pain in the head, so sharp as to make 
his features contract. Then it came again and again, till it left 
him no breathing space, and he sank down overcome by physical 
torture, but firm in his intention as he had been in the beginning. 
It was all over, and he would not argue his case again for many a 
long day. 

' Take me home I am very ill,' he gasped, as the baroness 
tried to feel his pulse. 

But she shook her head, for it seemed to her that it was too 
late. 

' You must stay here until you are better,' she answered softly. 
'The jolting of the carriage would hurt you.' 

He closed his eyes again, unable to speak, far less to discuss 



 

the matter. The mother and daughter whispered together and 
then both left the room, casting a last anxious glance at Greif as 
he lay almost unconscious with pain. 

Great was the consternation of Berbel when she heard that the 
young lord of Greifenstein had suddenly fallen ill in the house, but 
she was not a woman to waste words when time pressed. There 
was but one thing to be done. Greif must have Hilda's room and 
Hilda must take up her quarters with her mother. His carriage 
must fetch the physician from the nearest town, and bring such 
things as might be necessary. To Berbel's mind everything 
seemed already organised, and before any one had time to make a 
remark she had set about arranging matters to her own satisfac- 
tion. There was only one difficulty in the way, and that was 
Greif himself, who, in spite of his acute suffering had not the 
slightest intention of submitting to an illness at Sigmundskron. 

In the first moment the pain had altogether overcome him, but 
he gradually became so much accustomed to it as to be able to 
think more connectedly. The idea of remaining where he was 
seemed intolerable. To be taken care of by Frau von Sigmund- 
skron, to be under the same roof with Hilda, would be to give up 
the contest for which he had sacrificed so much. He did not 
understand that his mind would act very differently when he had 
recovered, and that much which seemed disagreeable at present, 
might be attractive then. 

He rose to his feet without assistance, and he saw that he was 
alone. Hilda had gone in one direction and her mother in another 
in search of something to alleviate his suffering. To get out of 
the house was the work of a moment. In the court there was the 
groom who had driven him, still rubbing down his horses and 
setting things to rights be-fore going inside to warm himself. The 
man was the same who had brought Greif the news at Schwarz- 
burg, a devoted fellow, born and bred on the estate, unlike the 
house servants who had been changed so often. 

'Karl,' said Greif, going up to him, 'you must harness and 
drive me back to Greifenstein at once. I am sorry for you, but I 
am too ill to stay here. I will walk down the road come after 
me as soon as you can.' 

There was nothing to be done but to obey the simple order. 
Karl looked surprised but lost no time, especially as Greif was 
already going out of the gate. In a trice the collars were on the 
horses again, the traces hitched, the reins unwound, and Karl was 
seated upon the box. He was glad for himself, though he thought 
it a very long pull for the horses. The road went downhill over 



 

most of the way, however, and Karl reflected that when his 
master was once in the carriage behind him, he could drive as 
slowly as he pleased. Just as he was ready, Frau von Sigmund- 
skron and Hilda appeared upon the threshold of the hall, both 
looking pale and anxious. They had found Greif gone from 
the sitting-room and had at first imagined that he had lost his 
way in the house ; but Hilda's quick ears caught the sounds that 
came from the court and she knew that the groom was putting 
the horses in. 

'What is that ?' asked Hilda, addressing the groom. 'Why 
have you harnessed again ? ' 

' The merciful lord has ordered it,' returned Karl, lifting his 
military cap with one hand while he held the reins with the 
other. ' The merciful lord has walked down the road, and I am 
to overtake him.' 

Therewith Karl turned his pair neatly and the horses trotted 
slowly towards the gate. 

' Stop, stop ! ' cried Hilda, running down the steps and following 
him, while her mother came after her more slowly. 

Karl drew up and looked back. 

' Herr von Greifenstein is very ill,' the girl said. ' He will 
never be able to drive alone so far indeed he ought to stay here 
and you should go for the doctor.' 

She was so much confused that she hardly knew what to say, 
when her mother joined her, calmer and more sensible. 

'You say that he went out of the gate. How long ago?' 
inquired the elder lady. 

' It may be five minutes.' 

' Did he say anything besides ordering the carriage ? ' 

' He said he was ill and must go home at once, and that he 
was sorry for me.' 

Frau von Sigmundskron hesitated. It was clear that Greif had 
not been so ill as she had at first supposed, or he could not have 
walked out alone, ordered the carriage and gone on without sup- 
port. Karl interrupted her meditations. 

' Merciful ladyships forgive me,' he observed, ' but if he walks 
farther he will be more ill.' He gathered the reins and prepared 
to move on. 

' Go, Karl,' said the baroness, and in a moment he was gone. 

' Mother you ought to have gone, too Hilda began,
