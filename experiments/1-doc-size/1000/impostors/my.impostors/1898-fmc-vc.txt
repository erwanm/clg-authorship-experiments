unlike her. 

It was folly and madness, and Castignac, the 
Gascon knight, would have laughed at him, or else 
would have believed that he was demented. But to 
the Englishman it was real, for he was under that 
strange melancholy which only Northmen know, and 
which is the most real suffering in all the world. 
It is a dim sadness that gathers like a cloud about 
strong men's souls, and they fear it, and sometimes 
kill themselves to escape from it into the outer dark- 
ness beyond; but sometimes it drives them to bad 
deeds and the shedding of innocent blood, and now 
and then the better sort of such men turn from the 
world and hide themselves in the abodes of sorrow 
and pain and prayer. The signs of it are that when 
it has no cause it seizes upon trifles to make 
them its reasons, and more often it torments young 
men than the old; and no woman nor southern 
person has ever known it, nor can even understand 
it. But it follows the northern blood from genera- 
tion to generation, like retribution for an evil without 
a name done long ago by the northern race. 

It was dark night when Gilbert found his way 
back to his tent, more by the instinct of one used to 
living in camps among soldiers than by any precise 
recollection of the way, and he sat down to warm 
himself before the brazier of red coals which Alric 
shovelled out of the camp-fire that burned outside. 
His men gave him a pottage of beans, with bread 
and wine, as it was Christmas Eve and a fast- 
day, and there was nothing else, for all the fish 





brought up from the sea had been bought early in 
the day for the great nobles, long before Gilbert 
had come into the lines. But he neither knew nor 
cared, and he ate mechanically what they gave him, 
being in a black humour. Then he sat a long time 
by the light of the earthenware lamp which Dunstan 
occasionally tended with an iron pin, lest the char- 
ring wick should slip into the half-melted fat and 
go out altogether. When he was not watching the 
wick, the man's eyes fixed themselves upon his 
master's grave face. 

"Sir," he said at last, "you are sad. This is the 
Holy Eve, and all the army will watch till midnight, 
when the first masses begin. If it please you, let us 
walk through the camp and see what we may. The 
tents of the great lords are all lighted up by this 
time and the soldiers are singing the Christmas 
hymns." 

Gilbert shook his head indifferently, but said 
nothing. 

"Sir," insisted the man, "I pray you, let us go, 
for you shall be cheered, and there are good sights. 
Before midnight the King and Queen and all the 
court go in procession to the great chapel tent, 
and it is meet that you should be there with 
them." 

Dunstan brought a garment and gently urged him 
to rise. Gilbert stood up, not looking. 

"Why should I go?" he asked. "I am better 
alone, for I am in a sad humour. And, besides, it 
is very cold." 

"Your cloak shall keep you warm, sir." 



 

"I cannot walk among the court people in rags," 
answered Gilbert; "and I have nothing that is whole 
but this one thin tunic." 

But even as he spoke, Dunstan held up the surcoat 
for him to put on over his head, the skirts caught 
up in his hands, which also held the collar open. 

" What is this ? " asked Gilbert, in surprise. 

"It is a knight's surcoat, sir," answered the man. 
" It is of very good stuff, and is wadded with down. 
I pray you, put it on." 

"This is a gift," said Gilbert, suspiciously, and 
drawing back. " Who sends me such presents ? " 

"The King of France, sir." 

"You mean the Queen." He frowned and would 
not touch the coat. 

"The things were brought by the King's men, 
and one of the King's knights came also with them, 
and delivered a very courteous message, and a purse 
of Greek bezants, very heavy." 

Gilbert began to walk up and down, in hesitation. 
He was very poor, but if the gifts were from the 
Queen, he was resolved not to keep them. 

"Sir," said Dunstan, "the knight said most ex- 
pressly that the King sent you these poor presents 
as a token that he desires to see you to-morrow and 
to thank you for all you have done. I thought to 
please you by bringing them out suddenly. " 

Then Gilbert smiled kindly, for the man loved 
him, and he put his head and arms into the knightly 
garment with its wide sleeves, and Dunstan laced it 
up the back, so that it fitted closely to the body, 
while the skirt hung down below the knees. It 





was of a ricli dark silk, woven in the East, and 
much like the velvet of later days. Then Dun- 
stan girded his master with a new sword-belt made 
of heavy silver plates, finely chased and sewn on 
leather, and he thrust the great old sword with its 
sheath through the flattened ring that hung to the 
belt by short silver chains. Lastly he put upon 
Gilbert's shoulders a mantle of very dark red cloth, 
lined with fine fur and clasped at the neck with 
silver ; for it was not seemly to wear a surcoat with- 
out a cloak. 

" It is very noble, " said Dunstan, moving back a 
step or two to see the effect. 

Indeed, the young English knight looked well in 
the dress of his station, which he wore for the first 
time ; for he was very tall and broad of shoulder, and 
a lean man, well-bred; his face was clear and pale, 
and his fair hair fell thick and long behind his cap. 

"But you, Dunstan, you cannot be seen — " 

Gilbert stopped, for he noticed suddenly that both 
his men were clad in new clothes of good cloth and 
leather. 

"The servants are honoured with their lord," said 
Dunstan. "The King sent gifts for us, too." 

"That was a man's thought, not a woman's," said 
Gilbert, almost to himself. 

He went out, and Dunstan walked by his left, but 
half a step behind his stride, as was proper. 

The camp was lit up with fires and torches as far as 
one could see, and all men were out of doors, either 
walking up and down, arm in arm, or sitting before 
their tents on folding-stools, or on their saddles, 



" 

or on packs of baggage. The hundreds and thou- 
sands of little Christmas trees, stuck into the earth 
amid circles of torches before the newly whitened 
tents, made a great garden of boughs and evergreens, 
and the yellow glare shone everywhere through lac- 
ing branches, and fell on rich colours and gleaming 
arms, well polished for the holiday, and lost itself 
suddenly in the cold starlight overhead. The air 
smelt of evergreen and the aromatic smoke of burn- 
ing resin. 

The night rang with song also, and in some places 
as many as a hundred had gathered in company to 
sing the long Christmas hymns they had learned as 
little children far away at home — endless canticles 
with endless repetitions, telling the story of the 
Christ-Child's birth at Bethlehem, of the adoration 
of the shepherds, and of the coming of the Eastern 
kings. 

In one part of the camp the rough Burgundians 
were drinking the strong Asian wine in deep 
draughts, roaring their great choruses between, with 
more energy than unction. But for the most part 
the northern men were sober and in earnest, praying 
as they sang and looking upward as if the Star of the 
East were presently to shed its soft light in the 
sky ; and they tended the torches and lights around 
the trees devoutly, not guessing that their fathers 
had done the same long ago, in bleak Denmark and 
snowy Norway, in worship of Odin and in honour of 
Yggdrasil, the tree of life. 

The Gascons and all the men of the South, on 
their side, had made little altars between two trees, 





decked with white cloths and adorned with tinsel 
ornaments and little crosses and small carved images 
carefully brought, like household gods, from the far 
home, and treasured only next to their arms. The 
thin, dark faces of the men were fervent with 
southern faith, and their wild black eyes were 
deep and still. 

There were also Alsatians and Lorrainers in lines 
by themselves, quiet, fair-haired men. They had 
little German dolls of wood, and toys brightly 
painted, and by their trees they set out the scene 
of Bethlehem, with the manger and the Christ- 
Child, and the oxen crouching down, and the Blessed 
Mary and Saint Joseph, and also the shepherds and 
the wise kings ; and the men sat down before these 
things with happy faces and sang their songs. So it 
was through the whole camp, the soldiers doing every- 
where according to their customs. 

As for the nobles and knights, Gilbert saw some 
of them walking about like himself, and some were 
sitting before their tents. Here and there, as he 
passed, when a tent was open, he saw knights 
kneeling in prayer, and could hear them reciting the 
litanies. But it was not always so, for some were 
spending the night in feasting, their tents being 
closed, though one could hear plainly the revelry. 
There was more than one great tent in the French 
lines, of which the curtain was raised a little, and 
there Gilbert saw men and women drinking together, 
under bright lights, and he saw that the women were 
Greeks and that their cheeks were painted and their 
eyelids blackened ; and he turned away from the 



 

sight, in disgust that such things should be done 
on the Holy Eve of Christmas. 

Further on, some very poor soldiers, in sheepskin 
doublets and leathern hose, were kneeling together 
before a sort of rough screen, on which were hung 
images painted in the manner of Greek eikons. 
These men had long and silky beards, and their 
smooth brown hair hung out over their shoulders in 
well-combed waves, and some of them had beautiful 
faces. One, who was a priest of their own, stood 
upright and recited prayers in a low chant, and from 
time to time, at the refrain, the soldiers all bowed 
themselves till their foreheads touched the ground. 

"The Lord Jesus Christ be praised," sang the 
priest. 

"To all ages. Amen," responded the soldiers. 

Though they sang in the Bohemian language, and 
Gilbert could not understand, he saw that they 
believed and were of an earnest mind. 

So he walked about for more than an hour, look- 
ing and listening, and his own sad humour was 
lightened a little as he forgot to think of himself 
only. For it seemed a great thing to have been 
chosen to lead so many through a wilderness full 
of danger, and to know that more than a hundred 
thousand lives had been in his keeping, as it were, 
for two months, and were to be in his hand again, 
till he should lead them safely into Syria, or perish 
himself and leave his task to another. It was 
a task worth accomplishing and a trust worth his 

life. 

Then, at midnight, he was walking in a great 





procession after the King and Queen. Modestly he 
joined the ranks, and his man walked beside him 
carrying a torch, so that the light fell full upon 
his face. Some one knew him, and spoke to his 
neighbour. 

"That is Sir Gilbert "Warde, who is our guide," 
he said. 

In an instant word ran along the line that he 
was there ; and in a few minutes a messenger came 
breathless, asking for him, and then the herald of 
France, Montjoye Saint Denis, came after, bidding 
him to a foremost place, in the name of the King and 
Queen. So he followed the herald, whose runner 
walked before him, as had been bidden by Eleanor 
herself. 

" Make way for the Guide of Aquitaine ! " cried 
the squire, in a loud voice. 

Knights and men-at-arms stood aside to let him 
pass, and the tall Englishman went between them, 
courteously bending his head to thank those who 
moved out of his way, and deprecating the high 
honour that was done him. He heard his name 
repeated, both by men whose faces he could see in 
the light around him, when the torches blazed and 
flamed, and also from the darkness beyond. 

"Well done. Sir Gilbert!" cried some. "God 
bless the Guide of Aquitaine I " cried many others. 
And all the voices praised him, so that his heart 
warmed. 

Following the herald, he came to his place in the 
procession, in the front rank of the great vassals of 
the two kingdoms, and just after the sovereign lords ; 



 

and as he was somewhat taller than other men, he 
could look over their heads, and he saw the King and 
Queen in their furs, walking together, and before 
them the bishops and priests. At the stir made by 
his coming Eleanor turned and looked back, and her 
eyes met Gilbert's through the smoky glare, gazing 
at him sadly, as if she would have made him under- 
stand something she could not say. 

But he would not have spoken if he could, for 
his thoughts were on other things. The procession 
went on toward the royal altar, set up under an open 
tent in a wide space, so that the multitude could 
kneel on the grass and both see and hear the cele- 
bration. So they all knelt down, the great barons 
and chief vassals having small hassocks for their 
knees, while the King and Queen and the sovereign 
lords of Savoy and Alsatia and Lorraine, and of 
Bohemia and of Poland, had rich praying-stools set 
out for. them in a row, next to the King and Queen. 

The torches were stuck into the ground to burn 
down as they might, and the great wax candles shone 
quietly on the white altar, for the night was now very 
still and clear. There all the great nobles and many 
thousands of other men heard the Christmas mass, 
just after midnight, knowing that many of them 
should never hear it again on earth. There they 
all sang together, in a mighty melody of older times, 
the 'Glory to God in the highest,' which was first 
sung on the Holy Eve; and there, when the Bishop 
of Metz was about to lift up the consecrated bread, 
tlie royal trumpets rang out a great call to the mul- 
titude, so that all men might bow themselves to- 





gether. Then the silence was very deep, while the 
Lord passed by; nor ever again in his life did Sir 
Gilbert Warde know such a stillness as that was, 
save once, and it seemed to him that in the Way 
of the Cross he had reached a place of refreshment 
and rest. 



CHAPTER XX 

GlLBEET rose from his knees with the rest, and then 
he saw that the King and Queen placed themselves 
side by side and standing, and the nobles began to 
go up to them according to their rank, to kiss their 
hands. As Gilbert stood still, not knowing what 
to do, he watched the procession of the barons from 
a distance. Suddenly he felt that his eyes were wide 
open, and that he was gazing at a face which he 
knew, hardly believing that he saw it in the flesh; 
and his back stiffened, and his teeth ground on one 
another. 

Ten paces from hiim, waiting and looking on, like 
himself, stood a graceful man of middle height, of 
a clear olive complexion, with a well-clipped beard 
of somewhat pointed cut, grey at the sides, as was 
also the smooth, dark hair. Years had passed, and 
the last time he had seen that face had been in the 
changing light of the greenwood, where the sunshine 
played among the leaves ; and as he had seen it 
last, he had felt steel in his side and had fallen 
asleep, and after that his life had changed. For 
Arnold de Curboil was before him, looking at him, 
but not recognizing him. Still Gilbert stood rooted 
to the spot, trying not to believe his senses, for 
he could not understand how his stepfather could 
suddenly be among the Crusaders ; but the divine 







peace that had descended upon him that night was 
shivered as a mirror by a stone, and his heart grew 
cold and hard. 

The man also was changed since Gilbert had seen 
him. The face was handsome still, but it was thin 
and sharp, and the eyes were haggard and weary, 
as if they had seen a great evil long and had 
sickened of it at last, and were haunted by it. Gil- 
bert looked at him who had murdered his father 
and had brought shame to his mother, and who had 
robbed him of his fair birthright, and he saw that 
something of the score had been paid. Gradually, 
too, as Sir Arnold gazed, a look of something like 
despair settled in his face, a sort of horror that was 
not fear, — for he was no coward, — but was rather 
a dread of himself. He made a step forward, and 
Gilbert waited, and heard how Dunstan, who stood 
behind him, loosened his dagger in its brass sheath. 

At that moment came the King's herald again as 
before, bidding him go up to the presence of the 
King and Queen. 

" Room for the Guide of Aquitaine ! " 

The cry rang loud and clear, and Gilbert saw Sir 
Arnold start in surprise at the high-sounding title. 
Then he followed the herald ; but in his heart 
there was already a triumph that the man who had 
left him for dead in the English woods should find 
him again thus preferred before other men. 

The Queen's face grew paler as he came toward 
her and knelt down on one knee, and through her 
embroidered glove of state his own hand, that was 
cold, felt that hers was colder. But it did no* 



 

tremble, and her voice was steady and clear, so that 
all could hear it. 

" Sir Gilbert "Warde," she said, " you have done 
well. Guienne thanks you, and France also — " 
She paused and looked toward the King, who was 
watching her closely. 

Louis bent his great pale face solemnly toward 
the Englishman. 

" We thank you, Sir Gilbert," he said, with cold 
condescension. 

"A hundred thousand men thank you," added 
Eleanor, in a ringing voice that was to make up 
for her husband's ungrateful indifference. 

There was a moment's silence, and then the voice 
of Gaston de Castignac, high and full, sent up a 
cheer that was heard far out in the clear night. 

" God bless the Guide of Aquitaine ! " 

The cheer was taken up in the deep shout of 
strong men in earnest ; for it was known how Gilbert 
cared not for himself, nor for rewards, but only for 
honour ; and the thirty men who had been with him 
had told far and wide how often he had watched 
that they might sleep, and how he would always give 
the best to others, and how gently and courteously 
he treated those he commanded. 

But in the loud cheering, Eleauor took his hand 
in both hers and bent down to speak to him, unheard 
by the rest ; and her voice was low and trembled 
a little. 

" God bless you ! " she said fervently. " God 
bless you and keep you, for as I am a living woman, 
you are dearer to me than the whole world." 





Gilbert understood how she loved him, as he had 
not understood before. And yet her touch had no 
evil power to move him now, and the shadow of his 
mother no longer haunted him in her eyes as he 
looked up. There, beside the Christmas altar, in the 
Holy Night, she was trying to complete the sacrifice 
of herself and her love. Gilbert answered her 
earnestly. 

"Madam," he said, "I shall try to do your will 
with all my heart, even to death." 

Thereafter he kept his word. But now he rose to 
his feet, and after bending his knee again, he looked 
into the Queen's sad eyes, and passed on to make 
way for the others, while the cheers that were for 
him still rang in the air. 

Then he began to walk to his tent. Dunstan had 
lighted a fresh torch and was waiting for him. But 
the great barons, who had gone up to the King and 
Queen before him, pressed round him and shook his 
hand, one after another, and bade him to their feast- 
ing on the morrow ; nor was there jealousy of him, 
as there had been when he had saved the Queen's 
life at Nicsea, for now that they saw him they felt 
that he was no courtier, and desired only the safety 
of the army, with his own honour. 

As they thronged about him, there came Sir Arnold 
de Curboil, pressing his way among them, and when 
he was before Gilbert he also held out his hand. 

" Gilbert Warde," he asked, " do you not know me ? " 

" I know you, sir," answered the young knight, in 
a clear voice that all could hear, " but I will not take 
your hand." 



 

There was silence, and the great nobles looked on, 
not understanding, while Dunstan held his torch 
so that the light fell full upon Sir Arnold's pale 
features. 

" Then take my glove ! " 

He plucked off his loose leathern gauntlet and 
tossed it lightly at Gilbert's face. But Dunstan's 
quick left hand caught it in the air, while the torch 
scarcely wavered in his right. 

Gilbert was paler than his enemy, but he would 
not let his hand go to his sword, and he folded his 
arms under his mantle, lest they should move against 
his will. 

" Sir," he said, " I will not fight you again at this 
time, though you killed my father treacherously. 
Though you have stolen my birthright, I will not 
fight you now, for I have taken the Cross, and I will 
keep the vow of the Cross, come what may." 

" Coward ! " cried Sir Arnold, contemptuously, and 
he would have turned on his heel. 

But Gilbert stepped forward and caught him by 
his arms and held him quietly, without hurting him, 
but so that he could not easily move and must hear. 

"You have called me a coward. Sir Arnold de 
Curboil. How should I fear you, since I can wring 
you to death in my hands if I will? But I will let 
you go, and these good lords here shall judge 
whether I am a coward or not because I will not 
fight you until I have fulfilled my vows." 

" Well said," cried the old Count of Bourbon. 

" Well said, well done," cried many others. 

Moreover, the Count of Savoy, of whose race 





none was ever born that knew fear, even to this 
day, spoke to his younger brother of Montferrat. 

" I have not seen a braver man than this English 
knight, nor a better man of his hands, nor one more 
gentle, and he has the face of a leader." 

Then Gilbert loosed his hold and Sir Arnold 
looked angrily to the right and left, and passed out 
of the crowd, all men making way for him as if they 
would not touch him. Some of them turned to 
Gilbert again, and asked him questions about the 
strange knight. 

" My lords," he answered, " he is Sir Arnold de 
Curboil, my stepfather; for when he had killed my 
father, he married my mother and stole my lands. 
I fought him when I was but a boy, and he left me 
for dead in the forest ; and now I think that he is 
come from England to seek occasion against me; but 
if I live I shall get back my inheritance. And now, 
if I seem to you to have dealt justly by him, I crave 
my leave of you, and thank your lordships for your 
good will and courtesy." 

So they bade him good-night, and he went away, 
leaving many who felt that he had done well, but 
that, in his place, they could not have done as much. 
They did not know how dear it cost him, but dimly 
they guessed that he was braver than they, though 
they were of the bravest. 

He was very tired, and had not slept in a good bed 
iinder his own tent for two months; yet he was sleep- 
less, and awoke after two hours, and could not sleep 
again till within an hour of the winter dawn ; for he 
feared some evil for Beatrix if her father should claim 



 

her of the Queen and take her back from Ephesus 
by sea, as he must have come. 

At daylight, warming themselves at a fire, Dun- 
stan told Alric all that happened in the night. The 
Saxon's stolid face did not change, but he was 
thoughtful and silent for some time, remembering 
how the Lady Goda had once had him beaten, long 
ago, because he had not held Sir Arnold's horse in 
the right way when the knight was mounting. 

Presently Beatrix's Norman tirewoman came to 
the two men, wrapped in a brown cloak with a hood 
that covered half her face. She told them that her 
lady knew of Sir Arnold's coming, and begged of Sir 
Gilbert that for her sake he would walk by the river 
at noon, when every one would be at dinner in the 
camp, and she would try and meet him there. 



CHAPTER XXI 

Gilbert waited long, for lie went down early to the 
river, and he sat on a big stone sunning himself, for 
the air was keen, and there was a north wind. At 
last he «aw two veiled women coming along the bank. 
The shorter one was a little lame and leaned upon 
the other's arm, and the wind blew their cloaks be- 
fore them as they came. When he saw that Beatrix 
limped, knowing that she had not quite recovered 
from her fall, and remembering that she might 
have been killed, his heart sank with a sickening 
faintness. 

He took her by the hand very gently, for she looked 
so slight and ill that he almost feared to touch her, 
and yet he did not wish to let her fingers go, nor she 
to take them away. The tirewoman went down to 
the river-bank, at some distance, and they sat upon 
the big stone, hand in hand like two children, and 
looked at each other. Suddenly the girl's face 
lightened, as if she had just found out that she 
was glad; her eyes laughed, and her voice was as 
happy as a bird's at sunrise. 

Gilbert had not seen her for a long time. To such 
a man, all women, and even one chosen woman, might 
easily become an ideal, too far from the material to 
have a real hold upon his manhood, and so high above 
earth as to have no spiritual realization. Even in that 





 

age many a knight made a divinity of his lady and 
a religion of his devotion to her, so that the very 
meaning of love was forgotten in the ascetic impulse 
to seek the soul's salvation in all things, even in the 
contempt of all earthly longings ; and those men de- 
manded as much in return, expecting it even after 
their own death. There were also women, like Anne 
of Auch, who gave such devotion freely. Neverthe- 
less, it was not altogether in this way between Beatrix 
and Gilbert, and if it might have been, so far as he 
was concerned, she would -not have had it so, and her 
words proved it. 

" I am so proud of you ! " she cried. "And I am 
so very glad to see you." 

" Proud of me ? " he asked, smiling sadly. " I am 
not proud of myself. For all I have done, you might 
be dead at Nicsea." 

" But I am alive," she answered happily, " and by 
your doing, though I cannot yet walk quite well." 

" I ought to have let the Queen pass on. I ought 
to have thought only of you." 

He found a satisfaction in saying aloud at last 
what had been so long in his heart against him- 
self, and in saying it to Beatrix herself. But she 
would not hear it. 

" That would have been very unknightly and dis- 
loyal," she said. " I would not have had you do it, 
for you would have been blamed by men. And 
then I should never have heard what I heard yester- 
day and last night, the very best words I ever 
heard in all my life — the cry of a great army 
blessing one man for a good work well done." 





" I have done nothing," answered Gilbert, stolidiy 
determined to depreciate himself in her eyes. 

But she smiled and laid her gloved hand quickly 
upon his lips. 

"I would not have another laugh at you, as I 
do ! " she cried. 

He looked at her, and the mask of grave melan- 
choly which was fast becomiag his natural expression 
began to soften, as if it could not last forever. 

" I have often thought of you and wondered 
whether you would think well of my deeds," he said. 

" You sefe ! " she laughed. " And now because 
I am proud of you, you pretend that you have done 
nothing ! That is poor praise of my good sight and 
judgment." 

He laughed, too. Since the dawn of time, women 
have retorted thus upon brave men too modest of their 
doings ; and since the first woman found the trick, 
it has never failed to please man. But love needs 
not novelty, for he himself is always young ; the 
stars of night are not less fair in our eyes because 
men knew the 'sweet influence of the Pleiades' in 
Job's day, nor is the scent of new-mown hay less 
delicate because all men love it. The old is the 
best, even in love, which is young. 

" Say what you will," answered Gilbert, presently, 
" we are together to-day." 

" And nothing else matters," said Beatrix. " Not 
even that it is two months since I have seen you, 
and that I have been ill, or, at least, half crippled, 
by that fall. It is all forgotten." 

He looked at her, not quite understanding, for as 



 

she spoke her eyebrows were raised a little, witli her 
own expression, half sad, half laughing at herself. 

"I wish I could see you more often," answered 
Gilbert. 

Her little birdlike laugh disconcerted him. 

" Indeed, I am in earnest," he said. 

" And yet when you are in earnest, you do much 
harder things," answered Beatrix, and at once the 
sadness had the better of the laughter in her face. 
"Oh, Gilbert, I wish we were back in England in 
the old days." 

" So do I ! " 

" Oh, no ! You do not. You say so to please me, 
but you cannot make it sound true. You are a 
great man now. You are Sir Gilbert Warde, the 
Guide of Aquitaine. It is you, and you only, who are 
leading the army, and you will have all the honour of 
it. Would you go back to the old times when we 
were boy and girl ? Would you, if you could ? " 

"I would if I could." 

He spoke so gravely that she understood where 
his thoughts were, and that they were not all for 
her. For a few moments she looked down in silence, 
pulling at the fingers of her glove, and once she 
sighed j then, without looking up, she spoke, in her 
sweet, low voice. 

"Gilbert, what are we to each other? Brother 
and sister ? " 

He started, again not understanding, and fancying 
that she was setting up the Church's canon between 
them, which he now knew to be no unremovable 
impediment.

" You are no more my sister than your tire- 
woman there can be," he answered, more warmly 
than he had spoken yet. 

" I did not mean that," she said sadly. 

"I do not understand, then." 

" If you do not, how can I tell you what I mean ? " 
She glanced at him and then looked away quickly, 
for she was blushing, and was ashamed of her 
boldness. 

" Do you mean that I love you as I might a 
sister ? " asked Gilbert, with the grave tactlessness 
of a thoroughly honest man. 

The blush deepened in her cheek, and she nodded 
slowly, still looking away. 

" Beatrix ! " 

" Well ? " She would not turn to him. 

" What have I done that you should say such a 
thing ? " 

" That is it ! " she answered regretfully. " You 
have done great things, but they were not for me." 

" Have I not told you how I have thought of you 
day after day, hoping that you might think well of 
my deeds ? " 

" Yes. But you might have done one thing more. 
That would have made all the difference." 

" What ? " He bent anxiously towards her for the 
answer. 

"You might have tried to see me." 

" But I was never in the camp. I was always a 
day's march in the lead of the army." 

"But not always fighting. There were days, or 
nights, when you could have ridden back. I would 





have met you anywhere — I would have ridden hours 
to see you. But you never tried. And at last it is 
I who send for you and beg you to come and talk 
with me here. And you do not even seem glad to 
be with me." 

"I did not think that I had a right to leave my 
post and come back, even for you." 

" You could not have helped it — if you had cared." 
She spoke very low. 

Gilbert looked at her long, and the lines deepened 
in his face, for he was hurt. 

" Do you really believe that I do not love you ? " 
he asked, but his voice was cold because he tried to 
control it, and succeeded too well. 

"You have never told me so," Beatrix answered. 
" You have done little to make me think so, since we 
were children together. You have never tried to see 
me when it would have cost you anything. You are 
not glad to see me now. " 

Her voice could be cold, too ; but there was a 
tremor in some of the syllables. He was utterly sur- 
prised and taken unawares, and he slowly repeated 
the substance of what she said. 

" I never told you so ? Never made you think so? 
Oh, Beatrix ! " 

He remembered the sleepless nights he had passed, 
accusing himself of letting even one thought of the 
Queen come between him and the girl who was de- 
nying his love — the restless, melancholy hours of 
self-accusation, the cruel self -torment — how could 
she know? 

She was in earnest, now, though she had begun 





half playfully; for if tlie man's heart had not changed, 
he had gone away from her in his active life, and in 
the habit of hiding all real feeling which comes from 
living long alone or with strangers. It was true that 
outwardly he had hardly seemed glad to see her, and 
all the ring of happiness had died away out of her 
voice before they had exchanged many words. He 
felt her mood, and it grew clear to him that he had 
made some great mistake which it would be very hard 
to set right. And she was thinking how boldly she 
had striven with the Queen for his love, and that now 
it seemed to be no love at all. 

But he, whose impulse was ever to act when there 
was danger, however much he might weary his soul 
with inward examination at other times, grew desper- 
ate, and gave up thinking of a way out of the difficulty. 
What he loved was slipping from him, and though 
he loved it in his own way, it was indeed all he loved, 
and he would not let it go. 

Thoughtless at last, and sudden, he took her into 
his arms, and his face was close to hers, and his eyes 
were in hers, and their lips breathed the same breath. 
She was not frightened, but her lids drooped, and she 
turned quite white. Then he kissed her, not once, 
but many times, and as if he would never let her go, 
on her pale mouth, on her dark eyelids, on her wav- 
ing hair. 

" If I kill you, you shall know that I love you," 
he said, and he kissed her again, so that it hurt her, 
but it was good to be hurt. 

After that she lay in his arms, very still, and she 
looked up slowly, and their eyes met; and it was as if 



 

the veil had fallen from between them. When he 
kissed her again, his kisses were gentle and altogether 
tender. 

"I had almost lost you," he said, breathing the 
words to her ear. 

The Norman tirewoman sat motionless by the 
river's edge, waiting till she should be called. After 
a time they began to talk again, and their voices 
were in tune, like their hearts. Then Gilbert spoke 
of what had happened in the night, but Beatrix 
already knew that her father had come. 

"He has come to take me away," she said, "and 
we have talked together. Gilbert — a dreadful thing 
has happened; did he tell you?" 

" He told me nothing — excepting that I was a 
coward ! " He laughed scornfully. 

" I think he is half mad with sorrow. " She paused 
and laid her hand on Gilbert's. " His wife is dead, — 
your mother is dead, — with the child she bore him."
