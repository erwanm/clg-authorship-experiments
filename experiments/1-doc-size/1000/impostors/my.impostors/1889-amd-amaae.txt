 

though not so many that bunched handsomely. We 
had made blackberry cordial, and three gallons of 
grape wine. 

Our pullets were coming on nicely. Three or four 
of the white Leghorns laid at five months, and some 
of the mixed ones. We had about ten beautiful 
light Brahmas, and began to average syc or eight 
eggs a day. We had a customer in New York for 
all our white Leghorn eggs at forty cents a dozen 
for the season. Of our old hens we had but five 
left, and they were good for another year. We 
resolved to force them all to their utmost, and see 
what we could do. The front of both houses was 
nearly all of glass, and had a southern exposure ; 
was good and warm and dry. 

Joe had not quite finished his work next door, 
but he was still kept busy. Indeed, on a rainy 
day, Joe and Bess were in great demand at the sta 
tion : then, there would be employment about the 
new buildings, so it did not seem worth while to go 
back to telegraphing. And I began to mistrust that 
Joe was dreaming of a home and a somebody, as he 
had once suggested. He was always escorting Ruth 
Montgomery somewhere, and it seemed as if she was 
not averse. Joe was too young and too poor to 
think of such a future ; but, after all 

" No, don't let us interfere," Eve had said. " If 



 

she should like Joe, she will wait; and I begin to 
think she will not do for Pryor. He needs a more 
stirring wife, a kind of stylish society girl, who 
will help him get rich." 

"And Joe needs a wife to keep him poor," I 
laughed. 

" No : Ruth might help him. There would be so 
many little ways, and he would make her very happy. 
Oh, what nonsense ! Well, let us neither make nor 
mar." 

I looked at him now, and the honest manliness 
shining in his eyes touched me. 

" This is solid comfort," he said presently, with a 
long breath. " When I have a house, I shall have 
a grate or a fireplace." 

We had started our heater, but so far had not 
needed much fire. This in the -reception-room was 
a luxury. We had settled again in our regular 
sleeping-rooms, though we all declared ourselves 
ready to vacate at the appearance of a crowd. But 
the girls were very busy with approaching wed 
dings. Even Sadie Brooke's had been set down for 
Christmas Eve. 

We were very happy, even if life had narrowed. 
Indeed, gay, laughing Eve seemed inclined to a little 
halt, especially as now she went to the city twice a 
week. We returned to regular reading ; and, by 



 

odd spells, she painted quite industriously. Our 
greenhouse experiment was a source of great inter 
est. We had put in our plants; and, though we 
would have no fire, we trusted to keep them alive. 
At least, we had some splendid blossoms now. 

Eve had another odd entertainment. From papers 
that one and another sent us, she cut out items of 
various kinds, and put them in scrap-books. She 
had collected quite a variety of chicken wisdom, of 
the care and culture of flowers, besides what she 
called her house-book, a very useful volume. We 
were all interested in experiments. Some we found 
useful and judicious : others we laughed over. 

Besides our out-of-door's garden, we had our dining- 
room window quite well filled. Miss Hildreth had 
sent Eve some lovely roses and bourvardias. 

Joe sprang up presently, and said it was train- 
time. He was so good about this matter, though 
sometimes I felt conscience-smitten. Indeed, it was 
quite delightful not to have to go all the time. 

"It almost seems as though we ought to move 
back to the station," declared Eve. "It was so easy 
and pleasant, with everybody dropping in. However, 
it will not be bitterly cold before January ; and then 
three months will pass rapidly." 

There was a step on the porch. " That is Pryor,' 
said Eve. 



 

Sure enough. He had our evening-mail in his 
hand, three letters for Eve. 

" Oh; how charmingly cosey you are here ! " he 
exclaimed. " I never did see people get so much 
good out of life," and he looked as if he envied both 
of us." 

" Oh ! " said Eve. " Helen Gaylord is coming 
over for a few days. And on Sunday, Estradura 
wants to dine with us, if it is not too great an incon 
venience. So our friends are not quite of the butter 
fly order. The first cold snap does not freeze them 
up. I was just saying to Adam that we would have 
to go back to the station, for fear no one would 
want to climb the hill." 

"I do not believe you will be left much to your 
own devices. Still, it was the jolliest thing! Do 
you know, Miss Eve, I have wondered many a time 
this summer how you had the courage to do it? 
Some people would have been buried: you flashed 
out a star of the first magnitude. And Athens has 
been coming to the front ever since. Ad, I have a 
scheme on hand myself. You know those lots on 
Elm Street?" 

I nodded. 

"They are one hundred and fifty feet front. I 
can build six nice cottages of five or six rooms, every 
two houses being joined together, and leaving a 



 

pretty open space between the alternate ones. 
Corwin thinks it worth the doing. I can rent them 
in the spring. Don't you want to help me plan? 
Miss Thurston, I want some of your ideas." 

Eve was interested at once. We brought out 
pencils and paper, and had an amusing time drawing 
cottages. Eve's plan was the best, we had to admit. 
She managed to put in more closets, to arrange win 
dows so the house would furnish nicely. Then she 
sketched out pretty fronts, so they should not all be 
just alike. 

" Corwin has sold one of his houses ; and the 
probability is, that the other will go. I am going to 
try for two hundred advance on mine ; and, if I can 
get that, I'll turn my money over. Though they 
will pay fair interest in renting. You see, the two 
new mills are going to stir up matters." 

I ran it over in my mind. If Pry or could make 
twelve hundred on his houses in one year, it would 
be quite an addition to his income. 

" What is Joe going about ? " he asked, rather 
abruptly. " Isn't Wilbur's place finished ? " 

" Yes, all that can be done now." 

" Joe is a nice fellow. If he should not care to go 
away, we can keep him busy. Do you know, Corwin 
and I have been talking of a lumber-yard ? If build 
ing should have a boom, it wouldn't be a bad thing. 



 

I should like a trusty, honest fellow, such as Joe is 
going to make. Yet I did not take much stock in 
him at first." 

" Joe is my protege" said Eve, rather proudly, and 
in a tone that forbade any doubtful remark. 

" O Miss Thurston ! adopt us all. There is not a 
soul of us who doesn't envy Joe. And all the young 
people are talking of what we can have this winter. 
Now, couldn't we form some kind of a social club, 
and have a little dancing and music, and now and 
then a regular supper that the gentlemen should 
provide? Think it over in your brilliant brain. 
Why, I would even meet up in the station. The 
best cup of coffee I ever had in my life was there." 

Eve laughed gayly. 

" Come up to-morrow night, and help me entertain 
Miss Gaylord," she said, as he was going away ; and 
he replied that he should be happy to. 

Joe did not come in until ten ; but he wore a rather 
shy, mysterious expression, that I think we both 
connected with Ruth. We told him of Pryor's visit 
and the prospect. 

"How good of him!" exclaimed Joe, with 
unaffected pleasure. " Do you know, I think the old 
Garden of Eden must have been here, and a little of 
the goodness is left to leaven everybody ? I shall get 
along just splendidly." 



 

We had been reading Warren's entertaining book, 
" Paradise regained." Eve had been training Joe in 
elocution; and he had such a nice, fresh, earnest 
voice, that it was a pleasure to listen when his turn 
came around. 

Miss Gaylord reached us the next morning, and 
found a warm welcome. Mr. Wilbur came over in 
the afternoon, and had a long interview with Joe, 
paying him his back wages. 

"And you could not guess," said Joe, when I 
entered the station. " I never would have believed 
such wonderful luck possible. He said " and Joe 
winked hard to keep the tears of joy and gratitude 
from his eyes " he said I had been so faithful, and 
worked so well, and actually saved him money, and 
that he had been putting by a little every week to 
make fair wages ; and it was absolutely fifty dollars, 
Thurston. I did not want to take it ; but he said I 
had been worth that, and more, and that I ought to 
study landscape-gardening, and make a business of 
it. Couldn't we get some books? And now I have 
one hundred and eighteen dollars, all my own, and 
good clothes, and am a sober fellow. I do not believe 
I ever will drink again, Thurston. I shall think of 
the health and prosperity and respectability, and, 
oh, the love one forfeits ! Think what I was last 
spring ! I don't know you both have been angels 



 

to me : I don't care if I do cry a little, there ! " and 
Joe wiped his eyes. 

"I want you to be strong enough to resist the 
temptation everywhere, not merely in a place like this. 
Could you stand up against the boys ? I want you 
to be proof against persuasion and jeers, and even 
that insidious little demon who whispers, ' Once will 
do no harm.' My dear boy," and I took his hand. 
He really seemed like a younger brother. 

"Miss Eve," he said that night, "I ought to be 
paying some board. I am going to earn two dollars 
a day. I am to keep my hours, and still manage my 
parcel business, though there will not be so many 
people wanting to ride out. And I am going to buy 
Pryor's horse for eighty dollars, paying him fifty 
down, and the rest he is going to take out in use. 
And you are so good to me; but you know there 
isn't much gardening now, or gathering of fruit and 
vegetables ; and you keep Letty all the time " 

" But you run down to the station, and let Adam 
sit at his ease at home ; and you look after the 
furnace, and chop wood, and bring me things, and 
take me driving " 

" That isn't any thing," he cried eagerly. " I'm 
glad to do it. There is not any thing I would not do 
for you and Adam. I shall feel better if you will 
let me pay you something." 



 

So it was settled on a basis of three dollars a 
week. Eve would not take any more, and Joe would 
not pay any less. 

" You see," said Eve, " there is the next interest 
provided for. And now I shall indulge in a new 
gown, and you must have a new suit of clothes." 

We made our living quite an economical matter. 
Meats we bought in a co-operative fashion, and 
divided : various other goods we purchased in large 
quantities. I had obliged my neighbors by ordering 
coal by the car-load, quite early in the season. We 
had obtained it a little less than cost, and had long 
tons; and it had proved very satisfactory. Once 
Mr. Wilbur had sent us fifty barrels of flour, when 
it had taken a tumble ; and I found no difficulty in 
disposing of them at a small profit, that gave us the 
price of one, though we made sure of two. By these 
methods, and our store of fruits and vegetables, we 
kept our living at a figure that was really a source 
of astonishment to me. Indeed, we had quite a little 
co-operative society in this matter. 

Pryor came up to help entertain our visitor, and 
it seemed as if he enjoyed it greatly. We made 
quite a summery picture in the glow of our wood- 
fire, with the hammocks up, and easy-chairs about. 
Two or three others dropped in, and we ended with 
a little music. 



 

"Adam," said my sister a few days later, when 
she and Helen had been visiting Miss Hildreth, going 
to an art-sale, and Eve had given her lesson, "I 
intend to be sinfully extravagant in the way of dress. 
Kitty Travers is to be married early in December, 
in church, at three, and have a two hours' reception. 
Sadie Brooke is to be married in church on Christ 
mas Eve, but goes right away, and will have a recep 
tion afterward. The Wilburs are to have an elegant 
tea, and I am asked to a theatre-party ; and, oh, I am 
to pour tea myself at Mrs. Harwood's ! So I shall 
get a pretty blue-velvet gown. I have white lace to 
trim it with, and black lace ; and I am going to have 
a cloth gown, trimmed with chinchilla fur, as I have 
oceans of that on hand. Miss Hildreth has a friend 
who can get a piece of velvet much more reasonably 
than at retail. Indeed, I have found that my mate 
rial will cost just thirty-six dollars, and my two 
music-scholars will pay for that. I am to have a 
third, I believe, at fifteen dollars a quarter ; and my 
four here are going on. Then I am likely to dispose 
of some Christmas work at Celia's studio. They are 
going to make a specialty of sales all December, and 
Celia asked me to send in some things." 

" Where are you going to get time to do every 
thing ? " I asked in amaze. 

" Well Helen insists that I have more time than 



 

most people. I think I know how to take advantage 
of every thing. Why, I am not as busy now as I 
was at aunt Carry's. Some people here in Athens 
would be dismayed at the rush in a fashionable 
woman's life. So you see," she says archly, " that 
I have not dropped out of society." 

Pryor was certainly devoted to us, or to Miss Gay- 
lord. We coaxed her to go on staying: she was 
such a pleasant, wholesome girl. Estradura came 
up, and enjoyed himself mightily. Pryor took both 
girls down to the theatre one evening. I was not 
sure whether it was a ruse to take out Eve, 
whether, indeed, his admiration of Miss Gaylord was 
not a blind. 

The young people in Athens were so in earnest to 
have a circle of pleasure, with Eve in it, that finally 
she helped them to form a Fortnight Club. It was 
to meet once in two weeks at different houses, with 
music, recitations or reading, tableaus or charades. 
The lady at whose house it met was responsible for 
the entertainment. Dancing was also to be allowed. 
Refreshments were discussed; and finally they set 
tled upon sandwiches, one kind of cake, coffee or 
cream. The first one who overstepped the boundary 
was to be fined five dollars. 

Eve asked them first to our house. A gentleman 
who was a member could invite a lady, a lady could 



IN A GARDEN 

bring an escort. The admission-fee was one dollar, 
and the members limited to twenty-five. Nineteen 
joined, and there were twenty-seven present. Besides, 
we had invited Celia Hildreth, and Helen, Frank, 
and Mr. Estradura. We had music, singing, and 
dancing ; and Pryor gave us an excellent Irish reci 
tation. At ten we were to end our pleasure, but 
they seemed very loth to go. So our evening was a 
success. Mr. and Mrs. Wharton had joined, and the 
second entertainment was to be at their house. 

I must say that we heard quite often from uncle 
Lennard. Sometimes he was in excellent spirits, 
sometimes quite depressed. But he was so eager to 
have Eve tell him how we were prospering with the 
house. This autumn aunt Carry's last daughter was 
married, so her soul would be no more perplexed 
with that anxiety. 

Our weeks absolutely flew by. Sadie Brooke 
made us two brief visits, and it seemed to me that 
she grew in beauty and in fun. We laughed unceas 
ingly when she was with us. Mr. Palmer came over 
one evening, and his engagement did not seem to 
burden him with gravity. 

" Isn't it funny," said Sadie, " that I should come 
over here, and find a lover ? Oh ! do you remember 
that first gay visit to the station? and what good 
times we had here last summer ? O Eve Thurston ! 



 

you are a confirmed match-maker. There's Gordon 
Pryor going the way of all the rest after Helen. He 
was awfully sweet on you, and jealous as a pasha last 
summer. Are you going to remain single, and laugh 
at your friends, as you see them floundering in the 
marshes of matrimony after a will-o'-wisp ? " 

" No," returned Eve solemnly. " I'm going to be 
married myself, when Mr. Right comes along." 

The blue velvet dress was lovely. It seemed as if 
Eve had never looked so beautiful in any thing save 
white. The cloth was dainty and jaunty, with its 
soft gray-fur trimming and muff. The club, the teas, 
the parties, and weddings came off in their succes 
sion. How Eve found time to paint, and embroider 
a little, and also to take an interest in church work, 
really puzzled me. 

Eve went down and spent the day before Christ 
mas with the Brookes. Sadie had five maids of 
honor, and was bewitching in silk and lace and 
flowers. I went down in the evening, and escorted 
my sister. The church was beautiful in its Christ 
mas adornments, and the wedding like a picture. 
Mrs. Palmer returned home, changed her dress, and 
they took the night-train to Baltimore, where Mr. 
Palmer's mother and an invalid sister lived, and who 
had begged they should come there for a Christmas 
dinner. 



 

I brought Eve out of all the splendor to our own 
little cottage. Joe had a bright fire in the grate, and 
some fragrant coffee on the stove. Was she so 
happy, so serenely content ? O Eve, my darling ! I 
wished that night I could be a millionnaire for your 
sake. You were worthy of the best. 

" Do you know," said Eve gayly, as she sipped her 
coffee, " that I have a new scheme ? I shall make 
your life a burden, Adam, but not about an apple. 
Here is Joe to do landscape-gardening. Here are 
you who can make a dry twig grow, if you stick it 
into the ground ; and I can make bouquets and 
bargains. The world is sighing for flowers. It is 
smothered in them, and yet, like Alexander the 
Great, ' it sighs for new curiosities to conquer.' We 
must become florists. We must go into a real garden. 
That is a subject for you to dream out on this 
blessed Christmas Eve. It has come to me like an 
inspiration ! " 

We both stared at her, the eyes lustrous and 
merry, the mouth daintily sweet, the cheek like a 
sun-kissed peach. 

Then she laughed. The clock was striking. 

" Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! " she cried, 
and kissed me, then turned to Joe with the sweetness 
of a sister. 

" Miss Eve," he said huskily, " you know I would 



do any thing for you. I'd go round the world. 
You have helped to make a man of me, and, by God's 
help, I mean never to shame your work. All my 
life long you will be to me an angel holding out your 
hand ; and if ever I should be tempted to go wrong, 
I will come and cling to it." 

Did we need to be any happier ? I forgot I was a 
poor young fellow on forty-five dollars a month. 



 



CHAPTER XIV 

WINTER BLOOMS IN EDEN 

EVE and I went to church Christmas morning. 
The sound of her voice in the hymns and carols will 
never vanish from my heart or brain, for it touched 
both. We were to go to the Corwins's for a two- 
o'clock dinner, and to the Morrisons's for the evening, 
as they were to have a grand Christmas-tree. Joe 
was to take Ruth Montgomery down to Northwood, 
to hear quite a famous singer. 

Altogether it was delightful. Just afterward came 
a cold snap and a splendid snow-storm. Joe hired a 
pretty cutter, and made the most of the pleasure. 
Certainly, the lad had a good deal of shrewdness in 
turning a penny, as old country people say. 

Some time after this, Helen came up again. It was 
quite evident that Pryor was in earnest. Eve took 
him in hand in an indescribable manner, as if she had 
been his sister. It was curious, but at first it almost 
seemed to me as if he had offered Eve an indignity. 
She spoke of it one evening when they had gone out 
sleigh-riding. 



" Having loved you, I do not see how he could love 
any other woman ! " I exclaimed. 

" O you foolish Adam ! Could it make me any 
happier if he went mourning and moody? He is 
young, vigorous, enthusiastic, and, I think, a bright, 
energetic young man ; the kind of person to have 
a happy home, wife and children, and prosper with 
them all. He has improved very much in a year, 
and the Gaylord connection will be just the thing 
for him. Helen was very noble about it. She was 
afraid at first that I might have cared ; and he was 
brave enough to tell her that he had liked me very 
much, and he desired us always to be friends. Helen 
will love him dearly, and that is just what he wants 
and needs. I am glad to have it so." 

" I wonder if you like Estradura better ? " I said 
slowly, watching her with eager eyes. 

" Not that way. We are very good friends." 

I remembered Pryor's jealousy of him, and smiled. 

"All the girls will be married presently," I con 
tinued ; and I know there was a suggestion of loneli 
ness in my tone. 

"Well, Dr. Johnson advised us to keep our 
friendships in repair. I have begun with Ce.lia Hil- 
dreth. And Mrs. Wilbur is to have a charming 
niece come from Georgia to spend next summer 
with her, and, of course, she will fall in love with 




me. My poor Adam, you will never stand any 
chance ! " 

She looked so utterly bewitching as she said this, 
with an assumption of melancholy, that I was com 
pelled to laugh. 

" Well, I am content to wait a while. Our league 
was for five years, you know ; and by that time we 
may each have a thousand dollars." 

" What a dismal tone ! A thousand dollars, and 
two thousand dollars' worth of enjoyment." 

Certainly we did not lack for the latter. Some 
one seemed to be coming all the time. Mrs. Har- 
wood was over and staid a week. She was not feel 
ing very well ; had been " dissipating too much," she 
declared. She used to lie in the hammock, with some 
pillows, and a bright shawl thrown over her, reading, 
or watching the grate-fire. We had taken to cannel- 
coal now, and its bright blaze pleased her wonder 
fully. She used to watch Eve as she flitted about. 
I remember this winter she wore a beautiful deep red 
gown, with a good deal of white lace about her neck ; 
and, somehow, it seemed to make her look taller and 
slenderer. 

We talked and read a great deal about green 
houses, and plants of all kinds. Our little green 
house had done very well. We had banked it up 
on the exposed sides, and had a double door. The 



 

roof was of double sashes ; and we covered them with 
matting and old carpets, or boards, on very cold 
nights ; but on days that were pleasant and sunny, 
we let them have the light. The pansies bloomed 
abundantly in February. Sweet alyssum, mignon 
ette, and some of the hardier red geraniums, kept 
in flower. 

Our chickens were doing pretty well, not as 
wonderfully as some we read about, but they gave 
us a profit ; while our neighbors' sat on the roost, or 
huddled together in some sunny corner. We gave 
them hot cooked food every morning. It stood on 
the back of the stove, and we kept our fires all night. 
I put plenty of red pepper in it, and we gave them 
an abundance of warm water to drink. In their 
water-kettle I generally kept a few old bits of iron 
that were in a state of rust. For dinner they had a 
light meal of wheat, buckwheat, and oats, and at 
night a solid meal of corn. Twice a week a sheep's 
pluck, and pounded or ground bone and oyster-shells. 
During December new-laid eggs went up to fifty 
cents; in January they touched sixty; February, 
still at fifty; in March, forty and thirty-five. All 
our refuse vegetables went to them ; and we let them 
run at large, except when it rained, or the snow was 
deep. We had forty-nine in all. In November we 
had three hundred eggs, and sold to the amount of 



 

five dollars ; in December, three hundred and sixty, 
and sold to eight dollars. January gave us five 
hundred, and we sold to fifteen dollars. February 
gave us six hundred, and we sold fourteen dollars' 
worth ; March, six hundred and eighty, bringing us 
in ten dollars. So up to the first of April we had 
realized fifty-two dollars. Now quite a number of 
the hens wanted to sit ; so we put them in the barn, 
and let them begin business. Among my Leghorns I 
had nine splendid layers ; the other seven were very 
indifferent, not as good as some of the common 
fowls ; and we decided now to use up a number of 
the poorest layers. Several of my Brahmas were 
immense, weighing seven and eight pounds. 

So we decided that poultry would pay. Ours had 
been an experiment very well attended to, yet it 
had proved no great amount of trouble. I felt that 
I would like to select some industry that I could 
carry on with my business. We rather inclined to 
the flowers. Every year they would come more into 
use, and the demand increase. One needed larger 
grounds for poultry-raising. Still, I felt, that, if I 
pushed it, even on my limited scale, I should make 
several hundred dollars a year besides all we wanted 
to use in eggs or chickens. 

During March I accomplished the painting of my 
house. Pryor and Mr. Corwin bought a large amount 



 

of a new kind of paint, highly recommended for 
its durability; and the quantity I needed cost me 
thirty-two dollars. I painted all my blinds, and most 
of the house, hiring only ten dollars' worth of work 
done. 

I had managed to put by fifteen dollars a month 
of my wages, and at the end of the six months had 
seventy dollars ; but I found that Eve had been saving 
up the interest as well. We had thirty dollars of 
the egg-money, and feed enough now to last the next 
two or three months. Of course, we paid the other 
hundred dollars, and were very happy over it. Now 
it was just an even two thousand, the face of the 
mortgage. After all, we had not pinched ourselves. 
Still, I knew well, and insisted, that I could have 
done very little without Eve's help ; and she could 
not have helped if she had not earned money. True, 
we might have gone on living at the station or in 
three rooms, and rigorously denied ourselves all 
society. But the real question is, whether the pos 
session of houses and lands, and money in the bank, 
is worth the sacrifice of returning to semi-barbarism ; 
for a life of deprivation amounts to that. We prate 
of living simply, and find our tramps, who go back 
to first principles, and pay no house-rent, intolerable 
nuisances. As we lop off here and there, we drop 
down in personal neatness and the amenities of life. 



 

Philip Gilbert Hammerton has discussed this point 
with much truth and fairness. 

But the fact remained, I wanted to get my 
fortune faster than at the rate of forty-five dollars a 
month. Hundreds would have jumped at my situa 
tion. You may estimate the great army of the 
unemployed when you count the number who apply 
for any position. Not a week through the autumn 
but some lads stopped to question me about my road, 
or any thing in the vicinity. They doubtless went to 
others. Some were nice, honest-looking young men : 
some bore traces of dissipation. I felt my own 
poverty and inability sorely at such times, though 
we did often give them a good meal. 

Of course, there were higher salaries than mine ; 
but these more fortunate ones were not going to step 
out for my sake. Then, I had tied myself to this 
place while I had my house, and the living here was 
pleasant ; but I wanted to be making more than my 
monthly stipend when I was forty. 

The past six months, Eve had earned one hundred 
and forty-six dollars by music-teaching, thirty-five by 
holiday work, and our boarders had brought us in 
one hundred and eighty-eight dollars. 

Among other things, we discussed a hotel. Pryor 
was infusing his own enthusiasm into some of the 
sleepy Athenians, rather, I should say, into some of 



 

the new-comers. The old families like the Mont- 
gomerys could hardly have been blown out of their 
rut by a charge of dynamite. Strangers were coming 
in to look at property. The paper-mills company 
built a nice dock. There was one wretched little 
lumber-pile connected with a coal and wood yard, 
kept by a Mr. Van Alen, who was a counterpart of 
Mr. Montgomery, and who always talked as if Pryor 
were an adventurer, and would soon bankrupt the 
whole town. 

Meanwhile, Pryor sold the middle houses in his 
row, which were the prettiest, we all thought, and 
rented two more at eighteen dollars a month. The 
one at the upper end was the least desirable, as it 
had no southern exposure ; but, when he offered this 
for fifteen dollars monthly, it was eagerly snapped up : 
and at May, the last one was rented. Corwin had 
bought some other lots, and decided to build again. 
If I only had a little money to join them in a venture ! 

The Randalls were delighted with these evidences 
of prosperity. Some of the old houses were repaired 
and painted, the streets cleared of stray bushes and 
blackberry-briers. Two more villas were sold. 

Pryor had lent out some money on property at the 
foot of Jay Street, and now made its owner a fair 
offer, that was presently taken. With the backing 
of Mr. Wilbur, he at once opened a lumber-yard, to 



 

the consternation of Mr. Van Alen. His affair with 
Miss Gaylord had progressed to an engagement. 
Helen had already bespoken board with Eve as soon 
as the first of June. Mr. Estradura proposed to 
come on the first of July. Indeed, Eve had appli 
cations enough to fill a large house. 

Joe, meanwhile, had bought a business-wagon at 
an auction sale. Pryor engaged him for general 
factotum, and moved his office up to Jay Street, 
making it that much nearer the station. He also pur 
chased another horse, and now they had a good team. 

If possible, spring looked lovelier than it had the 
year before. One cause, perhaps, was its lateness, and 
our gladness to welcome it. I had kept every thing 
in my garden quite up to the notch, and there really 
was little extra work to do. Two more trees were 
dead, a pear and a peach, but there were enough 
left. I must say here that I saved my pears very 
well until the middle of January, and we found them 
a great treat. Our grapes did not fare so well, and 
we used them up, but managed to have some Cataw- 
bas yet at Christmas. During April I had not 
counted on so much profit in eggs ; for we were 
beginning to use them largely, and some hens were 
off duty. But one day a man, who had heard the 
fame of our hens, came for a dozen white Leghorn 
eggs for hatching. I picked out the finest I could find, 



 

and charged him fifty cents ; though now they were 
down to thirty, and even twenty-five. The next day 
he came for some Brahmas, and engaged two dozen 
more Leghorns, making no demur at the price. In 
April we had seven hundred and ten eggs, to my 
great surprise. And quite often some one wanted 
eggs for setting, which kept up my profit wonderfully. 
I sold twenty dozen for ten dollars; ten dozen for 
three dollars and sixty cents. We never stinted our 
selves, and we were very fond of them. 

We discussed seriously the plan of finishing our 
extra rooms up-stairs. I purchased some lath, and 
hired a man by the day, helping him considerably. 
A mason came and put on the scratch-coat, following 
it shortly after by a smooth coat of brown. This 
I painted when it was dry, and put up some pretty 
bordering. One room was large, and very nice ; the 
other fair. After painting the floors, I found the 
whole cost to be not quite fifteen dollars. We 
decided to make a little change in the furniture; 
bought new matting for our dining-room, a new stair- 
carpet, and moved the others up-stairs; purchased 
a pretty single bedstead for one of the smaller rooms ; 
and, with various odds and ends, furnished the small 
one up-stairs, and bought a new set entire for the 
larger one, which was to belong to Eve when the 
house overflowed. 



 

Athens presented such a bright business aspect 
that it was quite inspiriting. Another incident oc 
curred to increase its prosperity ; though it was, in 
part, due to the energy of the towns above us. We 
were allowed four more trains daily, from seven to 
nine in the morning, and from four to six in the 
afternoon. Every room in Mrs. Ten Eyck's house 
was engaged by the middle of May, and one or two 
others ventured to open their houses. 

And now occurred an odd circumstance that did 
depress me at first, and seem to extinguish one of my 
hopes. Just north of the station, there was a large 
tract of ground, belonging to some heirs, that had 
lain unimproved for years. It fronted on Rutherford 
Avenue, and ran down to the river's edge. Myrtle 
Avenue had been laid out, and two cross-streets, but 
no improvements made. It sloped gradually, and 
had a lovely sunny exposure. Here and there a 
cherry or an old apple tree appeared, blossoming 
profusely, but despoiled of their fruit by the boys. 

Suddenly Athens was startled by more prospective 
improvements. The old Teall property was divided 
among six heirs. Two of them, living at a distance, 
placed their share at once in Mr. Pryor's hands for 
sale. One a Mr. James Teall had his surveyed, 
and staked off, and talked of building two handsome 
villas. A Miss Teall had married a gardener and 



 

florist, a Mr. Riker ; and he announced his intentions 
of beginning gardening on a large scale. They hired 
a cottage in the vicinity, and started work at once, 
ploughing, laying out, planning for greenhouses, 
planting vegetables, setting out shrubs and plants. 

I had not supposed that I could try such an 
experiment on my own place. Still, I meant to 
enlarge my flower-house considerably another year. 
But that some one else should come, armed with my 
idea, half broke my heart. To be sure, there were 
other places besides Athens ; and occasionally one 
heard of a plant for sale, already established. I did 
not yield to my despondency very long, for Eve 
looked at it in quite another light. 

" Adam," she said, " I think we may be able to 
learn a good deal, in case we want to take up such a 
business. We will watch what this Mr. Riker does, 
and make notes of all the ways and whys. I do 
think, if one could come to understand it, it would 
be a profitable business ; and I know now, if there 
was a prospect, Mrs. Harwood would come forward 
with assistance readily enough. So we will both 
keep our eyes open, and learn all we can. What a 
lucky happening for us ! " 

That cheered me immensely. My fears looked so 
small and foolish, that I would not confess them. 

Mr. Riker's ground had a frontage of five hundred 



 

feet on both Rutherford and Myrtle Avenues. Lin 
den Street was the first beyond Jay, and ran from 
the river up to the top of the hill. The next street 
was merely a wagon-road. The square gave him 
about five acres, the other six heirs had the same. 
Mr. Teall's property came next to this. I almost 
looked at the young fellow with envy, when by a 
lucky stroke, as one might say, he came into posses 
sion of such a beautiful plot of ground. 

His wife, judging from appearances, was five or 
six years the elder. He might have been twenty- 
five, not older. Following out Eve's hint, I walked 
over one day to make a friendly call, as he had been 
in the station several times. 

It seemed to me that he was undertaking too 
much ; that his garden-truck would be in the market 
too late for decent prices ; and that he had more on 
his hands than could be well attended to, unless he 
hired a great deal of help. But he seemed ambitious, 
confident, and was going to work with tremendous 
energy. He knew all about flowers and shrubs and 
soils, and quite confused me with his authoritative 
manner. 

Mr. Wilbur came up with his wife, and planned 
some finishing and furnishing for the house. The 
family were to move the last of May, leaving the two 
boys to board through the week, and attend their 



 

school for five weeks longer. Mr. Montgomery 
looked them' up a cow ; Joe found them a " man,' 
a stout young fellow of nineteen, who had been 
working on a stock-farm. The horse and carriage 
were sent up, and it looked quite homelike at our 
neighbors'. 

Mrs. Wilbur had not changed in the slightest 
degree, and was just as ready to monopolize Eve. 
The Palmers were coming for a week or so, as soon 
as matters were really settled. Sadie made the most 
enchanting of wives ; and Bertha had a young man, 
a special one. Soon all the gay crowd would settle 
themselves to other lives. 

I insisted that Eve should give up her music- 
teaching in New York through the summer, and she 
readily acquiesced. She had five pupils now at 
Athens. Miss Gaylord was to have our largest 
guest-chamber ; Estradura was to take the two small 
ones, using one for a dressing and sitting room. 
When Miss Hildreth arrived, she was to share Eve's 
chamber. Joe and I took the smaller rooms above. 
Letty, who was to stay with us through the summer, 
went home at night. Helen insisted, that, when there 
came occasional guests, she should be allowed to take 
Eve's sky-parlor. We made a delightful family, with 
just enough variety to keep us all fresh and full of 
zest.
