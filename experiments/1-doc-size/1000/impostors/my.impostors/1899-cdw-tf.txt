in very much the same cyclonic conditions that 
Mr. Ault revelled in. Those who know Wall 
Street best, by reason of sad experience, say that 
the presiding deity there is not the Chinese 
god, Luck, but the awful pagan deity, Nemesis. 
Alas ! how many innocent persons suflPer in order 
to get justice done in this world. 

Those who have unimpaired memories may 
recollect the fortune amassed, many years pre- 
vious to this history, by one Rodney Henderson, 
gathered and enlarged by means not indictable, 
but which illustrate the wide divergence between 
the criminal code and the moral law. This fort- 
une, upon the sudden death of its creator, had 
been largely diverted from its charitable desti- 
nation by fraud, by a crime that would have 
fallen within the code if it had been known. 
This fortune had been enjoyed by those who 
seized it for many years of great social success, 
rising into acknowledged respectability and dis- 
tinction ; and had become the basis of the chance 
of social elevation, which is dear to the hearts of 
so many excellent people, who are compelled to 
wander about in a chaotic society that has no 
hereditary titles. It was this fortune, the stake 




 

in such an ambition, or perhaps destined in a 
new possessor to a nobler one, that came in the 
way of Mr. Ault's extensive schemes. 

It is not necessary to infer that Mr. Ault was 
originally actuated by any greed as to this special 
accumulation of property, or that he had any 
malevolence towards Mr. Mavick ; but the eager- 
ness of his personal pursuit led him into collisions. 
There were certain possessions of Mr. Mavick 
that were desirable for the rounding-out of his 
plans — these graspings were many of them under- 
stood by the public as necessary to the " develop- 
ment of a system " — and in this collision of in- 
terests and fierce strength a vindictive feeling 
was engendered, a feeling born, as has been 
hinted, by Mr. Mavick's attempt to trick his 
temporary ally in a certain operation, so that Mr. 
Ault's main purpose was to "down Mavick." 
This was no doubt an exaggeration concerning a 
man with so many domestic virtues as Mr. Ault, 
meaning by domestic virtues indulgence of his 
family ; but a fight for place or property in poli- 
tics or in the Street is pretty certain to take on 
a personal character. 

We can understand now why Mr. Ault read 
the accounts of the Mavick ball with a grim 
smile. In speaking of it he used the vulgar term 
" splurge," a word especially offensive to the re- 
fined society in which the Mavicks had gained a 




 

foothold. And yet the word was on the lips of 
a great many men on the Street. The shifting 
application of sympathy is a very queer thing in 
this world. Mr. Ault was not a snob. What- 
ever else he was, he made few pretensions. In 
his first advent he had been resisted as an in- 
truder and shunned as a vulgarian ; but in time 
respect for his force and luck mingled with fear 
of his reckless talent, and in the course of events 
it began to be admitted that the rough diamond 
was being polished into one of the corner-stones 
of the great business edifice. At the time of this 
writing he did not altogether lack the sympathy 
of the Street, and an increasing number of people 
were not sorry to see Mr. Mavick get the worst 
of it in repeated trials of strength. And in each 
of these trials it became increasingly difficult for 
Mr. Mavick to obtain the assistance and the credit 
which are often indispensable to the strongest 
men in a panic. 

The truth was that there were many men in 
the Street who were not sorry to see Mr. Mavick 
worried. They remembered perfectly well the 
omniscient snobbishness of Thomas Mavick when 
he held a position in the State Department at 
Washington and was at the same time a secret 
agent of Rodney Henderson. They did not 
change their opinion of him when, by his alli- 
ance with Mrs. Henderson, he stepped into con- 




 

trol of Mr. Henderson's property and obtained 
the mission to Eome ; but later on he had been 
accepted as one of the powers in the financial 
world. There were a few of the old stagers who 
never trusted him. Uncle Jerry Hollowell, for 
instance, used to say, " Mavick is smart, smart as 
lightnin' ; I guess he'll make ducks and drakes 
of the Henderson property." They are very su- 
perficial observers of Wall Street who think that 
character does not tell there. Mr. Mavick may 
have realized that when in his straits he looked 
around for assistance. 

The history of this panic summer in !N"ew York 
would not be worthy the reader's attention were 
not the fortunes of some of his acquaintances in- 
volved in it. It was not more intense than the 
usual panics, but it lasted longer on account of 
the complications with uncertain government 
policy, and it produced stagnation in social as 
well as business circles. So quiet a place as Eiv- 
ervale felt it in the diminution of city visitors, 
and the great resorts showed it in increased civil- 
ity to the small number of guests. 

The summer at Newport, which had not been 
distinguished by many great events, was drawing 
to a close — that is, it was in the period when those 
who really loved the charming promenade which 
is so loved of the sea began to enjoy themselves, 
and those who indulge in the pleasures of hope, 




 

based upon a comfortable matrimonial establish- 
ment, are reckoning up the results of the cam- 
paign. 

Mrs. Mavick, according to her own assertion, 
was one of those who enjoy nature. " Nature 
and a few friends, not too many, only those whom 
one trusts and who ai'e companionable," she had 
said to Lord Montague. 

This young gentleman had found the pursuit 
of courtship in America attended by a good 
many incidental social luxuries. It had been a 
wise policy to impress him with the charm of a 
society which has unlimited millions to make it 
attractive. Even to an impecunious noble there 
is a charm in this, although the society itself has 
some of the lingering conditions of its money 
origin. But since the great display of the ball, 
and the legitimate inferences drawn from it by 
the press and the fashionable world, Mrs. Mavick 
had endeavored to surround her intended son-in- 
law with the toils of domestic peace. 

He must be made to feel at home. And this 
she did. Mrs. Mavick was as admirable in the 
role of a domestic woman as of a woman of the 
world. The simple pleasures, the confidences, 
the intimacies of home life surrounded him. His 
own mother, the aged duchess, could not have 
looked upon him with more affection, and possi- 
bly not have pampered him with so many luxu- 




 

ries. There was only one thing wanting to make 
this home complete. In conventional Europe 
the contracting parties are not the signers of the 
marriage contract. In the United States the par- 
ties most interested take the initiative in making: 
the contract. 

Here lay the difficulty of the situation, a situa- 
tion that puzzled Lord Montague and enraged 
Mrs. Mavick. Evelyn maintained as much in- 
difference to the domestic as to the worldly sit- 
uation. Her mother thought her lifeless and 
insensible ; she even went so far as to call her un- 
womanly in her indifference to what any other 
woman would regard as an opportunity for a 
brilliant career. 

Lifeless indeed she was, poor child; physically 
languid and scarcely able to drag herself through 
the daily demands upon her strength. Her 
mother made it a reproach that she was so pale 
and unresponsive. Apparently she did not resist, 
she did everything she was told to do. She 
passed, indeed, hours with Lord Montague, occa- 
sions contrived when she was left alone in the 
house with him, and she made heroic efforts to 
be interested, to find something in his mind that 
was in sympathy with her own thoughts. With 
a woman's ready instinct she avoided commit- 
ting herself to his renewed proposals, sometimes 
covert, sometimes direct, but the struggle tired 




 

her. At the end of all such interviews she had 
to meet her mother, who, with a smile of hope 
and encouragement, always said, "Well, I sup- 
pose you and Lord Montague have made it up," 
and then to encounter the contempt expressed 
for her as a " goose." 

She was helpless in such toils. At times she 
felt actually abandoned of any human aid, and 
in moods of despondency almost resolved to give 
up the struggle. In the eyes of the world it was 
a good match, it would make her mother happy, 
no doubt her father also ; and was it not her duty 
to put aside her repugnance, and go with the 
current of the social and family forces that seeijied 
irresistible ? 

Few people can resist doing what is universal- 
ly expected of them. This invisible pressure is 
more difficult to stand against than individual 
tyranny. There are no tragedies in our modern 
life so pathetic as the ossification of women's 
hearts when love is crushed under the compul- 
sion of social and caste requirements. Every- 
body expected that Evelyn would accept Lord 
Montague. It could be said that for her own 
reputation the situation required this consumma- 
tion of the intimacy of the season. And the 
mother did not hesitate to put this interpre- 
tation upon the events which were her own 
creation. 





 

But with such a character as Evelyn, who was 
a constant puzzle to her mother, this argument 
had very little weight compared with her own 
sense of duty to her parents. Her somewhat 
ideal education made worldly advantages of little 
force in her mind, and love the one priceless pos- 
session of a woman's heart which could not be 
bartered. And yet might there not be an ele- 
ment of selfishness in this — might not its sacrifice 
be a family duty? Mrs. Mavicli having found 
this weak spot in her daughter's armor, played 
upon it with all her sweet persuasive skill and 
show of tenderness. 

" Of course, dear," she said, " you know what 
would make me happy. But I do not want jo\x 
to yield to my selfishness or even to your father's 
ambition to see his only child in an exalted posi- 
tion in life. I can bear the disappointment. I 
have had to bear many. But it is your own 
happiness I am thinking of. And I think also of 
the cruel blow your refusal will inflict upon a 
man whose heart is bound up in you." 

"But I don't love him." The girl was very 
pale, and she spoke with an air of weariness, but 
still with a sort of dogged persistence. 

" You will in time. A young girl never knows 
her own heart, any more than she knows the 
world." ^ 

" Mother, that isn't all. It would be a sin to 

z 



 

him to pretend to give him a heart that was not 
his. I can't; I can't." 

" My dear child, that is his affair. He is will- 
ing to trust you, and to win your love. When 
we act from a sense of duty the way is apt to 
open to us. I have never told you of my own 
earlier experience. I was not so young as you 
are when I married Mr. Henderson, but I had 
not been without the fancies and experiences of 
a young girl. I might have yielded to one of 
them but for family reasons. My father had 
lost his fortune and had died, disappointed and 
broken down. My mother, a lovely woman, was 
not strong, was not capable of fighting the world 
alone, and she depended upon me, for in those days 
I had plenty of courage and spirit. Mr. Hender- 
son was a widower whom we had known as a 
friend before the death of his accomplished wife. 
In his lonesomeness he turned to me. In our 
friendlessness I turned to him. Did I love him ? 
I esteemed him, I respected him, I trusted him, 
that was all. He did not ask more than that. 
And what a happy life we had! I shared in all 
his great plans. And when in the midst of his 
career, with such large ideas of public service 
and philanthropy, he was stricken down, he left 
to me, in the confidence of his love, all that fort- 
une which is some day to be yours." Mrs. 
Mavick put her handkerchief to her eyes. " Ah, 




 

well, our destiny is not in our hands. Heaven 
raised up for me another protector, another 
friend. Perhaps some of my youthful illusions 
have vanished, but should I have been happier if 
I had indulged them ? I know your dear father 
does not think so." 

" Mother," cried Evelyn, deeply moved by this 
unprecedented confidence, " I cannot bear to see 
you suffer on my account. But must not every 
one decide for herself what is right before God?" 

At this inopportune appeal to a higher power 
Mrs. Mavick had some difficulty in restraining 
her surprise and indignation at what she consid- 
ered her child's stubbornness. But she conquered 
the inclination, and simply looked sad and ap- 
pealing when she said : 

" Yes, yes, you must decide for yourself. You 
must not consider your mother as I did mine." 

This cruel remark cut the girl to the heart. 
The world seemed to whirl around her, right and 
wrong and duty in a confused maze. "Was she, 
then, such a monster of ingratitude? She half 
rose to throw herself at her mother's feet, upon 
her mother's mercy. And at the moment it was 
not her reason but her heart that saved her. In 
the moral confusion rose the image of Philip. 
Suppose she should gain the whole world and 
lose him ! And it was love, simple, trusting love, 
that put courage into her sinking heart. 





 

"Mother, it is very hard. I love you; I could 
die for you. I am so forlorn. But I cannot, I 
dare not, do such a thing, such a dreadful thing !" 

She spoke brokenly, excitedly, she shuddered 
as she said the last words, and her eyes were full 
of tears as she bent down and kissed her mother. 

"When she had gone, Mrs. Mavick sat long in 
her chair, motionless between bewilderment and 
rage. In her heart she was saying, " The obsti- 
nate, foolish girl must be brought to reason !" 

A servant entered with a telegram. Mrs. Ma- 
vick took it, and held it listlessly while the ser- 
vant waited. " You can sign." After the door 
closed — she was still thinldng of Evelyn — she 
waited a moment before she tore the envelope, 
and with no eagerness unfolded the official yel- 
low paper. And then she read : 

" I have Tnade an assignment. — T. M." 

A half-hour afterwards when a maid entered 
the room she found Mrs. Mavick still seated in 
the arm-chair, her hands powerless at her side, 
her eyes staring into space, her face haggard 
and old. 



CHAPTER XXV 

The action of Thomas Mavick in giving up 
the figlit was as unexpected in New York as it 
was in Newport. It was a shock even to those 
familiar with the Street. It was known that he 
was in trouble, but he had been in trouble be- 
fore. It was known that there had been sacri- 
fices, efforts at extension, efforts at compromise, 
but the general public fancied that the Mavick 
fortune had a core too solid to be washed away 
by any storm. Only a very few people knew — 
such old hands as Uncle Jerry Hollowell, and 
such inquisitive bandits as Murad Ault — that the 
house of Mavick was a house of cards, and that 
it might go down when the belief was destroyed 
that it was of granite. 

The failure was not an ordinary sensation, and, 
according to the excellent practices and differing 
humors of the daily newspapers, it was made the 
most of, until the time came for the heavy week- 
lies to handle it in its moral aspects as an il- 
lustration of modern civilization. On the first 
morning there was substantial unanimity in as- 




 

suming the totality of the disaster, and the most 
ingenious artists in head -lines vied with each 
other in startling effects : " Crash in "Wall Street." 
" Mavick Runs Up the White Flag." " King of 
Wall Street Called Down." " Ault Takes the 
Pot." " Dangerous to Dukes." " Mavick Bank- 
rupt." " The House of Mavick a Euin." " Dukes 
and Drakes." " The Sea Goes Over Him." 

This, however, was only the beginning. The 
sensation must be prolonged. The next day 
there were attenuating circumstances. It might 
be only a temporary embarrassment. The as- 
sets were vastly greater than the liabilities. 
There was talk in financial circles of an adjust- 
ment. With time the house could go on. The 
next day it was made a reproach to the house 
that such deceptive hopes were put upon the 
public. Journalistic enterprise had discovered 
that the extent of the liabilities had been con- 
cealed. This attempt to deceive the public, these 
defenders of the public interest would expose. 
The next day the wind blew from another di- 
rection. The alarmists were rebuked. The cred- 
itors were disposed to be lenient. Doubtful se- 
curities were likely to realize more than was 
expected. The assignees were sharply scored 
for not taking the newspapers into their confi- 
dence. 

And so for ten days the failure went on in the 




 

newspapers, backward and forward, now hope- 
less, now relieved, now sunk in endless compli- 
cations, and fallen into the hands of the lawyers 
who could be trusted with the most equitable 
distribution of the property involved, until the 
reading public were glad to turn, with the same 
eager zest, to the case of the actress who was 
found dead in a hotel in Jersey City. She was 
attended only by her pet poodle, in whose collar 
was embedded a jewel of great price. This jewel 
was traced to a New York establishment, whence 
it had disappeared under circumstances that point- 
ed to the criminality of a scion of a well-known 
family — an exposure which would shake society 
to its foundations. 

Meantime affairs took their usual course. The 
downfall of Mavick is too well known in the 
Street to need explanation here. For a time it 
was hoped that sacrifices of great interests would 
leave a modest little fortune, but under the press- 
ure of liquidation these hopes melted away. If 
anything could be saved it would be only com- 
paratively valueless securities aud embarrassed 
bits of property that usually are only a delusion 
and a source of infinite worry to a bankrupt. 
It seemed incredible that such a vast fortune 
should so disappear; but there were wise men 
who, so they declared, had always predicted this 
disaster. For some years after Henderson's death. 





 

the fortune had appeared to expand marvellous- 
ly. It was, however, expanded, and not solidified. 
It had been risked in many gigantic speculations 
(such as the Argentine), and it had been liable to 
collapse at any time if its central credit was 
doubted. Mavick's combinations were splendidly 
conceived, but he lacked the power of co-ordina- 
tion. And great as were his admitted abilities, 
he had never inspired confidence. 

" And, besides," said Uncle Jerry, philosophiz- 
ing about it in his homely way, " there's that 
little devil of a Carmen, the most fascinating 
woman I ever knew — it would take the Bank of 
England to run her. Why, when I see that 
Golden House going up, I said I'd give 'em 
five years to balloon in it. I was mistaken. 
They've floated it about eighteen. Some folks 
are lucky — -up to a certain point." 

Grave history gives but a paragraph to a per- 
sonal celebrity of this sort. When a ship goes 
down in a tempest off the New England coast, 
there is a brief period of public shock and sym- 
pathy, and then the world passes on to other 
accidents and pleasures ; but for months relics of 
the great vessel float ashore on lonely headlands 
or are cast up on sandy beaches, and for years, 
in many a home made forlorn by the ship- 
wreck, are aching hearts and an ever-present 
calamity. 





 

The disaster of the house of Mavick was not 
accepted without a struggle, lasting long after 
the public interest in the spectacle had abated — 
a struggle to save the ship and then to pick up 
some debris from the great wreck. The most 
pathetic sight in the business world is that of a 
bankrupt, old and broken, pursuing with always 
deluded expectations the remnants of his fort- 
une, striving to make new combinations, involved 
in law -suits, alternately despairing, alternately 
hopeful in the chaos of his affairs. This was the 
fate of Thomas Mavick. 

The news was all over Newport in a few hours 
after it had stricken down Mrs. Mavick. The 
newspaper details the morning after were read 
with that eager interest that the misfortunes of 
neighbors always excite. After her first stupor, 
Mrs. Mavick refused to believe it. It could not 
be, and her spirit of resistance rose with the 
frantic messages she sent to her husband. Alas, 
the cold fact of the assignment remained. Still 
her courage was not quite beaten down. The 
suspension could only be temporary. She would 
not have it otherwise. Two days she showed 
herself as usual in Newport, and carried herself 
bravely. The sympathy looked or expressed was 
wormwood to her, but she met it with a reas- 
suring smile. To be sure it was very hard to 
bear such a blow, the result of a stock intrigue, 




 

but it would soon pass over — ^it was a temporary 
embarrassment — that she said everywhere. 

She had not, however, told the news to Evelyn 
with any such smiling confidence. There was 
still rage in her heart against her daughter, as 
if her obstinacy had some connection with this 
blow of fate, and she did not soften the announce- 
ment. She expected to sting her, and she did 
astonish and she did grieve her, for the breaking- 
up of her world could not do otherwise ; but it was 
for her mother and not for herself that Evelyn 
showed emotion. If their fortune was gone, then 
the obstacle was removed that separated her 
from Philip. The world well lost ! This flashed 
through her mind before she had fairly grasped 
the extent of the fatality, and it blunted her ap- 
preciation of it as an unmixed ruin. 

" Poor mamma !" was what she said. 

" Poor me !" cried Mrs. Mavick, looking with 
amazement at her daughter — " don't you under- 
stand that our life is all ruined ?" 

" Yes, that part of it, but we are left. It 
might have been so much worse." 

"Worse? Tou have no more feeling than a 
chip. You are a beggar! That is all. What do 
you mean by worse ?" 

" If father had done anything dishonorable !" 
suggested the girl, timidly, a little scared by her 
mother's outburst. 





 

" Evelyn, you are a fool !" 

And perhaps she was, with such preposterous 
notions of what is really valuable in life. There 
could be no doubt of it from Mrs. Mavick's point 
of view. 

If Evelyn's conduct exasperated her, the non- 
appearance of Lord Montague after the publica- 
tion of the news seriously alarmed her. No 
doubt he was shocked, but she could explain it to 
him, and perhaps he was too much interested in 
Evelyn to be thrown off by this misfortune. The 
third day she wrote him a note, a familiar, almost 
affectionate note, chiding him for deserting them 
in their trouble. She assured him that the news 
was greatly exaggerated, the embarrassment was 
only temporary, such things were alwaj'S happen- 
ing in the Street. " You know," she said, playful- 
ly, "it is our American way to be up in a minute 
when we seem to be down." She asked him to 
call, for she had something that was important 
to tell him, and, besides, she needed his counsel as 
a friend of the house. The note was despatched 
by a messenger. 

In an hour it was returned, unopened, with a 
verbal message from his host, saying that Lord 
Montague had received important news from 
London, and that he had left town the day be- 
fore. 

" Coward !" muttered the enraged woman, with 




 

closed teeth. "Men are all cowards, put them 
to the test." 

The energetic woman judged from a too nar- 
row basis. Because Mavick was weak — and she 
had always secretly despised him for yielding to 
her — weak as compared with her own indomita- 
ble spirit, she generalized wildly. Her opinion of 
men would have been modified if she had come 
in contact with Murad Ault. 

To one man in New York besides Mr. Ault the 
failure did not seem a personal calamity. When 
Philip saw in the steamer departures the name of 
Lord Montague, his spirits rose in spite of the 
thought that the heiress was no longer an heiress. 
The sky lifted, there was a promise of fair 
weather, the storm, for him, had indeed cleared 
the air. 

" Dear Philip," wrote Miss McDonald, " it is 
really dreadful news, but I cannot be so very 
downhearted. It is the least of calamities that 
could happen to my dear child. Didn't I tell 
you that it is always darkest just before the 
dawn ?" 

And Philip needed the hope of the dawn. 
Trial is good for any one, but hopeless suffering 
for none. Philip had not been without hope, 
but it was a visionary indulgence, against all evi- 
dence. It was the hope of youth, not of reason. 
He stuck to his business doggedly, he stuck to 




 

his writing doggedly, but over all his mind was 
a cloud, an oppression not favorable to creative 
effort — that is, creative effort sweet and not cyni- 
cal, sunny and not morbid. 

And yet, who shall say that this very experi- 
ence, this oppression of circumstance, was not 
the thing needed for the development of the 
best that was in him. Thrown back upon him- 
self and denied an airy soaring in the heights of 
a prosperous fancy, he had come to know him- 
self and his limitations. And in the year he 
had learned a great deal about his art. For one 
thing he had come to the ground. He was look- 
ing more at life as it is. His experience at the 
publishers' had taught him one important truth, 
and that is that a big subject does not make a 
big writer, that all that any mind can contribute 
to the general thought of the world in litera- 
ture is what is in itself, and if there is nothing 
in himself it is vain for the writer to go far 
afield for a theme. He had seen the young art- 
ists, fretting for want of subjects, wandering the 
world over in search of an object fitted to their 
genius, setting up their easels in front of the 
marvels of nature and of art, in the expectation 
that genius would descend upon them. If they 
could find something big enough to paint ! And 
he had seen, in exhibition after exhibition, that 
the artist who cannot paint a rail-fence cannot 





 

paint a pyramid. A man does not become a 
good rider by mounting an elephant; ten to one 
a donkey would suit him better. Philip had 
begun to see that the life around him had ele- 
ments enough of the comic and the tragic to 
give full play to all his powers. He began to 
observe human beings as he had never done be- 
fore. There were only two questions, and they 
are at the bottom of all creative literature — could 
he see them, could he make others see them ? 

This was all as true before the Mavick failure 
as after ; but, before, what was the use of effort ? 
Now there was every inducement to effort. Am- 
bition to succeed had taken on him the hold of 
necessity. And with a free mind as to the ob- 
stacles that lay between him and the realization 
of the great dream of his life, the winning of the 
one woman who could make his life complete, 
Philip set to work with an earnestness and a 
clearness of vision that had never been given 
him before. 

In the wreck of the Mavick estate, in its distri- 
bution, there are one or two things of interest to 
the general reader. One of these was the fate 
of the Golden House, as it was called. Mrs. 
Mavick had hurried back to her town house, de- 
termined to save it at all hazard. The impossi- 
bility of this was, however, soon apparent even 
to her intrepid spirit. She would either sacri- 




 

fice all else to save it, or — dark thoughts of end- 
ing it in a conflagration entered her mind. This 
was only her first temper. But to keep the 
house without a vast fortune to sustain it was 
an impossibility, and, as it was the most con- 
spicuous of Mavick's visible possessions, perhaps 
the surrender of it, which she could not prevent, 
would save certain odds and ends here and there. 
"Whether she liked it or not, the woman learned 
for once that her will had little to do with the 
course of events. 

Its destination was gall and wormwood both 
to Carmen and her husband. For it fell into the 
hands of Murad Ault. He coveted it as the 
most striking symbol of the position he had 
conquered in the metropolis. Its semi- barbaric 
splendor appealed also to his passion for display. 
And it was notable that the taste of the rude lad 
of poverty, this uncultivated offspring of a wan- 
dering gypsy and herb - collector — perhaps she 
had ancient and noble blood in her veins — should 
be the same for material ostentation and luxury 
as that of the cultivated, fastidious Mavick and 
his worldly minded wife. So persistent is the 
instinct of barbarism in our modern civilization. 

When Ault told his wife what he had done, 
that sweet, domestic, and sensible woman was 
very far from being elated. 

" I am almost sorry," she said. 




 

" Sorry for what ?" asked Mr. Ault, gently, but 
greatly surprised. 

"For the Mavicks. I don't mean for Mrs. 
Mavick — I hear she is a worldly and revengeful 
woman — but for the girl. It must be dreadful to 
turn her out of all the surroundings of her happy 
life. And I hear she is as good as she is lovely. 
Think what it would be for our own girls." 

" But it can't be helped," said Ault, persuasive- 
ly. " The house had to be sold, and it makes no 
difference who has it, so far as the girl is con- 
cerned." 

" And don't you fear a little for our own girls, 
launching out that way ?" 

" You are afraid they will get lost in that big 
house ?" And Mr. Ault laughed. " It isn't a bit 
too big or too good for them. At any rate, my 
dear, in they go, and you must get ready to 
move. The house will be empty in a week." 

" Murad," and Mrs. Ault spoke as if she were 
not thinking of the change for herself, " there is 
one thing I wish you would do for me, dear." 

"What is that?" 

" Go to Mr. Mavick, or to Mrs. Mavick, or the 
assignees or whoever, and have the daughter — 
yes, and her mother — free to take away anything 
they want, anything dear to them by long asso- 
ciation. Will you ?" 

" I don't see how. Mavick wouldn't do it for 
us, and I guess he is too proud to accept anything 
from me. I don't owe him anything. And then 
the property is in the assignment. Whatever is 
there I bought with the house." 

" I should be so much happier if you could do 
something about it." 

""Well, it don't matter much. I guess the 
assignees can make Mrs. Mavick believe easy 
enough that certain things belong to her. But I 
would not do it for any other living being but 
you." 

"By-the-way," he added, "there is another 
bit of property that I didn't take, the ISTewport 
palace." 

"I should have dreaded that more than the 
other." 

" So I thought. And I have another plan. It's 
long been in my mind, and we will carry it out 
next summer. There is a little plateau on the 
side of the East Mountain in Eivervale, where 
there used to stand a shack of a cabin, with a wild 
sort of garden-patch about it, a tumble-down root 
fence, all in the midst of brush and briars. Lord, 
what a habitation it was! But such a view- 
rivers, mountains, meadows, and orchards in the 
distance ! That is where I lived with my mother. 
"What a life ! I hated everything, everybody but 
her." 

Mr. Ault paused, his strong, dark face working 

a 



 

with passion, as the memory of his outlawed 
boyhood revived. Is it possible that this pirate 
of the Street had a bit of sentiment at the 
bottom of his heart ? After a moment he con- 
tinued : 

" That was the spot to which my mother took 
me when I was knee-high. I've bought it, 
bought the whole hill-side. Next summer we 
will put up a house there, not a very big house, 
just a long, low sort of a Moorish pavilion, the 
architect calls it. I wish she could see it." 

Mrs. Ault rose, with tears in her gentle eyes, 
stood by her husband's chair a moment, ran her 
fingers through his heavy black locks, bent down 
and kissed him, and went away without a word. 

There was another bit of property that was not 
included in the wreck. It belonged to Mrs. 
Mavick. This was a little house in Irving Place, 
in which Carmen Eschelle lived with her mother, 
in the days before the death of Henderson's first 
wife, not very happy days for that wife. Carmen 
had a fancy for keeping it after her marriage. 
Not from any sentiment, she told Mr. Mavick on 
the occasion of her second marriage, oh no, but 
somehow it seemed to her, in all her vast posses- 
sions left to her by Henderson, the only real 
estate she had. It was the only thing that had 
not passed into the absolute possession and con- 
trol of Mavick. The great town house, with all 




 

the rest, stood in Mavick's name. What secret 
influence had he over her that made her submit 
to such a foolish surrender ? 

It was in this little house that the reduced 
family stowed itself after the downfall. The 
little house, had it been sentient, would have 
been astonished at the entrance into it of the 
furniture and the remnants of luxurious living 
that Mrs. Maviok was persuaded belonged to her 
personally. These reminders of former days 
were, after all, a mockery in the narrow quarters 
and the pinched economy of the bankrupt. Yet 
they were for a time useful in preserving to 
Mrs. Mavick a measure of self-respect, her self- 
respect having always been based upon what she 
had and not what she was. In truth, the change 
of lot was harder for Mrs. Mavick than for Evelyn, 
since the world in which the latter lived had not 
been destroyed. She still had her books, she 
still had a great love in her heart, and hope, 
almost now a sure hope, that her love would 
blossom into a great happiness. 

But where was Philip ? In all this time why 
did he make no sign ? At moments a great fear 
came over her. She was so ignorant of life. 
Could he know what misery she was in, the daily 
witness of her father's broken condition, of her 
mother's uncertain temper? 




CHAPTER XXVI 

Is justice done in this world only by a suc- 
cession of injustices? Is there any law that a 
wrong must right a wrong ? Did it rebuke the 
means by which the vast fortune of Henderson 
was accumulated, that it was defeated of any 
good use by the fraud of his wife? "Was her 
action punished by the same unscrupulous tactics 
of the Street that originally made the fortune ? 
And Ault? "Would a stronger pirate arise in 
time to despoil him, and so act as the JSTemesis 
of all violation of the law of honest relations be- 
tween men? 

The comfort is, in all tliis struggle of the evil 
powers, masked as justice, that the Almighty 
Ruler of the world does not forget his own, and 
shows them a smiling face in the midst of dis- 
aster. There is no mystery in this. For the 
noble part in man cannot be touched in its in- 
tegrity by such vulgar disasters as we are con- 
sidering. In those days when Evelyn saw dis- 
solving about her the material splendors of her 
old life, while the Golden House was being dis- 




 

mantled, and she was taking sad leave of the 
scenes of her girlhood, so vivid with memory 
of affection and of intellectual activity, they 
seemed only the shell, the casting-off of which 
gave her freedom. The sun never shone bright-
