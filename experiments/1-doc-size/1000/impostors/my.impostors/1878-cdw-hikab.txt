speedily when the effort is relaxed. If you clear a 
patch of fertile ground in the forest, uproot the stumps 
and plant it, year after year, in potatoes and maize, 
you say you have subdued it. But if you leave it 
for a season or two, a kind of barbarism seems to steal 
out upon it from the circling woods ; coarse grass and 
brambles cover it ; bushes spring up in a wild tangle ; 
the raspberry and the blackberry flower and fruit, 
and the humorous bear feeds upon them. The last 
state of the ground is worse than the first. 

Perhaps the cleared spot is called Ephesus. 
There is a splendid city on the plain ; there are tem- 
ples and theatres on the hills ; the commerce of the 
world seeks its port ; the luxury of the Orient flows 
through its marble streets. You are there one day 
when the sea has receded: the plain is a pestilent 
marsh ; the temples, the theatres, the lofty gates, have 
sunken and crumbled, and the wild-brier runs over 
them ; and, as you grow pensive in the most desolate 
place in the world, a bandit lounges out of a tomb, 
and offers to relieve you of all that which creates arti- 
ficial distinctions in society. The higher the civil- 
ization has risen, the more abject is the desolation 
of barbarism that ensues. The most melancholy spot 





in the Adirondacks is not a tamarack-swamp, where 
the traveller wades in moss and mire, and the at- 
mosphere is composed of equal active parts of black- 
flies, mosquitos, and midges. It is the village of the 
Adirondack Iron- Works, where the streets of gaunt 
houses are falling to pieces, tenantless; the factory- 
wheels have stopped ; the furnaces are in ruins ; the 
iron and wooden machinery is strewn about in help- 
less detachment ; and heaps of charcoal, ore, and slag 
proclaim an arrested industry. Beside this deserted 
village, even Calamity Pond, shallow, sedgy, with its 
ragged shores of stunted firs, and its melancholy shaft 
that marks the spot where the proprietor of the iron- 
works accidentally shot himself, is cheerful. 

The instinct of barbarism that leads people periodi- 
cally to throw away the habits of civilization, and 
seek the freedom and discomfort of the woods, is ex- 
plicable enough ; but it is not so easy to understand 
why this passion should be strongest in those who 
are most refined, and most trained in intellectual 
and social fastidiousness. Philistinism and shoddy 
do not like the woods, unless it becomes fashionable 
to do so ; and then, as speedily as possible they in- 
troduce their artificial luxuries, and reduce the life in 
the wilderness to the vulgarity of a well-fed picnic. 
It is they who have strewn the Adirondacks with 
paper collars and tin cans. The real enjoyment of 
camping and tramping in the woods lies in a return 
to primitive conditions of lodging, dress, and food, in 
as total an escape as may be from the requirements of 
civilization. And it remains to be explained why this 
is enjoyed most by those who are most highly civilized. 
It is wonderful to see how easily the restraints of so- 
ciety fall off. Of course it is not true that courtesy 





depends upon clothes with the best people ; but, with 
others, behavior hangs almost entirely upon dress. 
Many good habits are easily got rid of in the woods. 
Doubt sometimes seems to be felt whether Sunday is a 
legal holiday there. It becomes a question of casuistry 
with a clergyman whether he may shoot at a mark on 
Sunday, if none of his congregation are present. He 
intends no harm : he only gratifies a curiosity to see if 
he can hit the mark. Where shall he draw the line ? 
Doubtless he might throw a stone at a chipmunk or 
shout at a loon. Might lie fire at a mark with an 
air-gun that makes no noise ? He will not fish or 
hunt on Sunday (although he is no more likely to 
catch anything that day than on any other) ; but 
may he eat trout that the guide has caught on Sun- 
day, if the guide swears he caught them Saturday 
night ? Is there such a thing as a vacation in reli- 
gion ? How much of our virtue do we owe to inher- 
ited habits ? 

I am not at all sure whether this desire to camp 
outside of civilization is creditable to human nature, 
or otherwise. We hear sometimes that the Turk has 
been merely camping for four centuries in Europe. 
I suspect that many of us are, after all, really camp- 
ing temporarily in civilized conditions ; and that 
going into the wilderness is an escape, longed forp 
into our natural and preferred state. Consider what 
this " camping out " is, that is confessedly so agreeable 
to people most delicately reared. I have no desire 
to exaggerate its delights. 

The Adirondack wilderness is essentially unbroken. 
A few bad roads that penetrate it, a few jolting 
wagons that traverse them, a few barn-like boarding- 
houses on the edge of the forest, where the boarders 





are soothed by patent coffee, and stimulated to unnat- 
ural gayety by Japan tea, and experimented on by 
unique cookery, do little to destroy the savage f ascina* 
tion of the region. In half an hour, at any point, one 
can put himself into solitude and every desirable dis- 
comfort. The party that covets the experience of the 
camp comes down to primitive conditions of dress and 
equipment. There are guides and porters to carry 
the blankets for beds, the raw provisions, and the 
camp equipage ; and the motley party of the tempo- 
rarily decivilized files into the woods, and begins, per- 
haps by a road, perhaps on a trail, its exhilarating and 
weary march. The exhilaration arises partly from 
the casting aside of restraint, partly from the adven- 
ture of exploration ; and the weariness, from the in- 
terminable toil of bad walking, a heavy pack, and the 
grim monotony of trees and bushes, that shut out all 
prospect, except an occasional glimpse of the sky. 
Mountains are painfully climbed, streams forded, 
lonesome lakes paddled over, long and muddy '' car- 
ries " traversed. Fancy this party the victim of polit- 
ical exile, banished by the law, and a more sorrowful 
march could not be imagined ; but the voluntary 
hardship becomes pleasure, and it is undeniable that 
the spirits of the party rise as the difficulties increase. 
For this straggling and stumbling band the world is 
young again ; it has come to the beginning of things ; 
it has cut loose from tradition, and is free to make a 
home anywhere : the movement has all the promise of 
a revolution. All this virginal freshness invites the 
primitive instincts of play and disorder. The free 
range of the forests suggests endless possibilities of 
exploration and possession. Perhaps we are treading 
where man since the creation never trod before ; per- 





haps the waters of this bubbling spring, which we 
deepen by scraping out the decayed leaves and the 
black earth, have never been tasted before, except by 
the wild denizens of these woods. We cross the trails 
of lurking animals, — paths that heighten our sense 
of seclusion from the world. The hammering of the 
infrequent woodpecker, the call of the lonely bird, the 
drumming of the solitary partridge, — all these sounds 
do but emphasize the lonesomeness of nature. The 
roar of the mountain brook, dashing over its bed of 
pebbles, rising out of the ravine, and spreading, as it 
were, a mist of sound through all the forest (contin- 
uous beating waves that have the rhythm of eternity 
in them), and the fitful movement of the air-tides 
through the balsams and firs and the giant pines, — 
how these grand symphonies shut out the little exas- 
perations of our vexed life ! It seems easy to begin 
life over again on the simplest terms. Probably it is 
not so much the desire of the congregation to escape 
from the preacher, or of the preacher to escape from 
himself, that drives sophisticated people into the wil- 
derness, as it is the unconquered craving for primitive 
simplicity, the revolt against the everlasting dress* 
parade of our civilization. From this monstrous pom- 
posity even the artificial rusticity of a Petit Trianon ^ 
is a relief. It was only human nature that the jaded 
Frenchman of the regency should run away to the 
New World, and live in a forest-hut with an Indian 
squaw ; although he found little satisfaction in his act 
of heroism, unless it was talked about at Versailles. 

When our trampers come, late in the afternoon, to 
the bank of a lovely lake where they purpose to enter 
the primitive life, everything is waiting for them in 

^ A little palace near the royal one at Versailles. 





virgin expectation. There is a little promontory jut- 
ting into the lake, and sloping down to a sandy beach, 
on which the waters idly lapse, and shoals of red-fins 
and shiners come to greet the stranger ; the forest is 
untouched by the axe; the tender green sweeps the 
water's edge ; ranks of slender firs are marshalled by 
the shore ; clumps of white-birch stems shine in satin 
purity among the evergreens; the boles of giant 
spruces, maples, and oaks, lifting high their crowns of 
foliage, stretch away in endless galleries and arcades ; 
through the shifting leaves the sunshine falls upon 
the brown earth ; overhead are fragments of blue sky ; 
under the boughs and in chance openings appear the 
bluer lake and the outline of the gracious mountains. 
The discoverers of this paradise, which they have en- 
tered to destroy, note the babbling of the brook that 
flows close at hand ; they hear the splash of the leap- 
ing fish ; they listen to the sweet, metallic song of the 
evening thrush, and the chatter of the red squirrel, 
who angrily challenges their right to be there. But 
the moment of sentiment passes. This party has come 
here to eat and to sleep, and not to encourage Nature 
in her poetic attitudinizing. 

The spot for a shanty is selected. This side shall 
be its opening, towards the lake ; and in front of it 
the fire, so that the smoke shall drift into the hut, and 
discourage the mosquitoes ; yonder shall be the cook's 
fire and the path to the spring. The whole colony 
bestir themselves in the foundation of a new home, — 
an enterprise that has all the fascination, and none of 
the danger, of a veritable new settlement in the wil- 
derness. The axes of the guides resound in the echo- 
ing spaces ; great trunks fall with a crash ; vistas are 
opened towards the lake and the mountains. The 





spot for the shanty is cleared of underbrush; forked 
stakes are driven into the ground, cross-pieces are 
laid on them, and poles sloping back to the ground. 
In an incredible space of time there is the skeleton of 
a house, which is entirely open in front. The roof 
and sides must be covered. For this purpose the 
trunks of great spruces are skinned. The woodman 
rims the bark near the foot of the tree, and again six 
feet above, and slashes it perpendicularly ; then, with 
a blunt stick, he crowds off this thick hide exactly as 
an ox is skinned. It needs but a few of these skins 
to cover the roof ; and they make a perfectly water- 
tight roof, except when it rains. Meantime, busy 
hands have gathered boughs of the spruce and the 
feathery balsam, and shingled the ground underneath 
the shanty for a bed. It is an aromatic bed : in the- 
ory it is elastic and consoling. Upon it are spread 
the blankets. The sleepers, of all sexes and ages, are 
to lie there In a row, their feet to the fire, and their 
heads under the edge of the sloping roof. Nothing 
could be better contrived. The fire is in front : it is 
not a fire, but a conflagration — a vast heap of green 
logs set on fire — of pitch, and split dead-wood, and 
crackling balsams, raging and roaring. By the time 
twilight falls, the cook has prepared supper. Every- 
thing has been cooked in a tin pail and a skillet, — 
potatoes, tea, pork, mutton, slapjacks. You wonder 
how everything could have been prepared in so few 
utensils. When you eat, the wonder ceases : every- 
thing might have been cooked in one pail. It is a 
noble meal ; and nobly is it disposed of by these ama- 
teur savages, sitting about upon logs and roots of 
trees. Never were there such potatoes, never beans 
that seemed to have more of the bean in them, 





never such curly pork, never trout with more In- 
dian-meal on them, never mutton more distinctly 
sheepy ; and the tea, drunk out of a tin cup, with a 
lump of maple-sugar dissolved in it, — it is the sort 
of tea that takes hold, lifts the haii^ and disposes the 
drinker to anecdote and hilariousness. There is no 
deception about it : it tastes of tannin and spruce and 
creosote. Everything, in short, has the flavor of the 
wilderness and a free life. It is idyllic. And yet, 
with all our sentimentality, there is nothing feeble 
about the cooking. The slapjacks are a solid job of 
work, made to last, and not go to pieces in a per- 
son's stomach like a trivial bun : we might record on 
them, in cuneiform characters, our incipient civiliza- 
tion; and future generations would doubtless turn 
them up as Acadian bricks. Good, robust victuals 
are what the primitive man wants. 

Darkness falls suddenly. Outside the ring of light 
from our conflagration the woods are black. There 
is a tremendous impression of isolation and lonesome- 
ness in our situation. We are the prisoners of the 
night. The woods never seemed so vast and mysteri- 
ous. The trees are gigantic. There are noises that 
we do not understand, — mysterious winds passing 
overhead, and rambling in the great galleries, tree- 
trunks grinding against each other, undefinable stirs 
and uneasinesses. The shapes of those who pass into 
tiie dimness are outlined in monstrous proportionSo 
The spectres, seated about in the glare of the fire, 
talk about appearances and presentiments and reli- 
gion. The guides cheer the night with bear-fights, 
and catamount encounters, and frozen-to-death expe- 
riences, and simple tales of great prolixity and no 
point, and jokes of primitive lucidity. We hear cata- 





mounts, and the stealthy tread of things in the leaves, 
and the hooting of owls, and, when the moon rises, 
the laughter of the loon. Everything is strange, 
spectral, fascinating. 

By and by we get our positions in the shanty for 
the night, and arrange the row of sleepers. The 
shanty has become a smoke-house by this time: 
waves of smoke roll into it from the fire. It is only 
by lying down, and getting the head well under the 
eaves, that one can breathe. No one can find her 
" things ; " nobody has a pillow. At length the row 
is laid out, with the solemn protestation of intention 
to sleep. The wind, shifting, drives away the smoke. 
Good-night is said a hundred times ; positions are re- 
adjusted, more last words, new shifting about, final 
remarks ; it is all so comfortable and romantic ; and 
then silence. Silence continues for a minute. The 
fire flashes up ; all the row of heads is lifted up simul- 
taneously to watch it ; showers of sparks sail aloft into 
the blue night ; the vast vault of greenery is a fairy 
spectacle. How the sparks mount and twinkle and 
disappear like tropical fire-flies, and all the leaves 
murmur, and clap their hands ! Some of the sparks 
do not go out : we see them flaming in the sky when 
the flame of the fire has died down. Well, good- 
night, good-night. More folding of the arms to 
sleep ; more grumbling about the hardness of a hand- 
bag, or the insufficiency of a pocket-handkerchief, for 
a pillow. Good-night. Was that a remark? — 
something about a root, a stub in the ground sticking 
into the back. '' You couldn't lie along a hair? " — 
" Well, no : here 's another stub.'' It needs but a 
moment for the conversation to become general,-- 
about roots under the shoulder, stubs in the back, a 





ridge on which it is impossible for the sleeper to bal- 
ance, the non-elasticity of boughs, the hardness of the 
ground, the heat, the smoke, the chilly air. Subjects 
of remarks multiply. The whole camp is awake, and 
chattering like an aviary. The owl is also awake; 
but the guides who are asleep outside make more 
noise than the owls. Water is wanted, and is handed 
about in a dipper. Everybody is yawning; every- 
body is now determined to go to sleep in good ear- 
nest. A last good-night. There is an appalling 
silence. It is interrupted in the most natural way 
in the world. Somebody has got the start, and gone 
to sleep. He proclaims the fact. He seems to have 
been brought up on the seashore, and to know how 
to make all the deep-toned noises of the restless 
ocean. He is also like a war-horse; or, it is sug- 
gested, like a saw-horse. How malignantly he snorts, 
and breaks off short, and at once begins again in an- 
other key ! One head is raised after another. 

"Who is that?" 

" Somebody punch him." 

" Turn him over." 

" Reason with him." 

The sleeper is turned over. The turn was a mis- 
take. He was before, it appears, on his most agree- 
able side. The camp rises in indignation. The sleeper 
sits up in bewilderment. Before he can go off again, 
two or three others have preceded him. They are all 
alike. You can never judge what a person is when 
he is awake. There are here half a dozen disturbers 
of the peace who should be put in solitary confine- 
ment. At midnight, when a philosopher crawls out 
to sit on a log by the fire, and smoke a pipe, a duet in 
tenor and mezzo-soprano is going on in the shanty, 





with a chorus always ooming in at the wrong time. 
Those who are not asleep want to know why the 
smoker doesn't go to bed. He is requested to get 
some water, to throw on another log, to see what time 
it is, to note whether it looks like rain. A buzz of 
conversation arises. She is sure she heard something 
behind the shanty. He says it is all nonsense. '' Per- 
haps, however, it might be a mouse." 

" Mercy! Are there mice ? " 

'' Plenty." 

" Then that 's what I heard nibbling by my head. I 
sha'n't sleep a wink ! Do they bite ? " 

"No, they nibble; scarcely ever take a full bite 
out." 

"It's horrid!" 

Towards morning it grows chilly ; the guides have 
let the fire go out ; the blankets will slip down. Anx- 
iety begins to be expressed about the dawn. 

" What time does the sun rise? " 

" Awful early. Did you sleep ? " 

" Not a wink. And you ? " 

" In spots. I 'm going to dig up this root as soon 
as it is light enough." 

"See that mist on the lake, and the light just com- 
ing on the Gothics ! I 'd no idea it was so cold : all 
the first part of the night I was roasted." 

" What were they talking about all night ? '* 

When the party crawls out to the early breakfast, 
after it has washed its faces in the lake, it is disor- 
ganized, but cheerful. Nobody admits much sleep; 
but everybody is refreshed, and declares it delightful. 
It is the fresh air all night that invigorates ; or maybe 
it is the tea or the slapjacks. The guides have erected 
a table of spruce bark, with benches at the sides ; so 





that breakfast is taken in form. It is served on tin 
plates and oak chips. After breakfast begins the 
day's work. It may be a mountain-climbing expedi- 
tion, or rowing and angling in the lake, or fishing for 
trout in some stream two or three miles distant. No- 
body can stir far from camp without a guide. Ham- 
mocks are swung, bowers are built, novel-reading be- 
gins, worsted work appears, cards are shuffled and 
dealt. The day passes in absolute freedom from re- 
sponsibility to one's self. At night, when the expedi- 
tions return, the camp resumes its animation. Adven- 
tures are recounted, every statement of the narrator 
being disputed and argued. Everybody has become 
an adept in wood-craft ; but nobody credits his neigh- 
bor with like instinct. Society getting resolved into 
its elements, confidence is gone. 

Whilst the hilarious party are at supper, a drop or 
two of rain falls. The head guide is appealed to. Is 
it going to rain ? He says it does rain. But will it 
be a rainy night ? The guide goes down to the lake, 
looks at the sky, and concludes that if the wind shifts 
a p'int more, there is no telling what sort of weather 
we shall have. Meantime the drops patter thicker on 
the leaves overhead, and the leaves, in turn, pass the 
water down to the table; the sky darkens; the wind 
rises ; there is a kind of shiver in the woods ; and we 
scud away into the shanty, taking the remains of our 
supper, and eating it as best we can. The rain in= 
creases. The fire sputters and fumes. All the trees 
are dripping, dripping, and the ground is wet. We 
cannot step out-doors without getting a drenching. 
Like sheep, we are penned in the little hut, where no 
one can stand erect. The rain swirls into the open 
front, and wets the bottom of the blankets. The 





smoke drives in. We curl up, and enjoy ourselves. 
The guides at length conclude that it is going to be 
damp. The dismal situation sets us all into good 
spirits ; and it is later than the night before when we 
crawl under our blankets, sure this time of a sound 
sleep, lulled by the storm and the rain resounding on 
the bark roof. How much better off we are than 
many a shelterless wretch ! We are as snug as dry 
herrings. At the moment, however, of dropping off 
to sleep, somebody unfortunately notes a drop of wa- 
ter on his face ; this is followed by another drop ; in 
an instant a stream is established. He moves his 
head to a dry place. Scarcely has he done so, when 
he feels a dampness in his back. Reaching his hand 
outside, he finds a puddle of water soaking through 
his blanket. By this time, somebody inquires if it is 
possible that the roof leaks. One man has a stream 
of water under him ; another says it is coming into 
his ear. The roof appears to be a discriminating 
sieve. Those who are dry see no need of such a fuss. 
The man in the corner spreads his umbrella, and the 
protective measure is resented by his neighbor. In 
the darkness there is recrimination. One of the 
guides, who is summoned, suggests that the rubber 
blankets be passed out, and spread over the roof. The 
inmates dislike the proposal, saying that a shower- 
bath is no worse than a tub-bath. The rain continues 
to soak down. The fire is only half alive. The bed- 
ding is damp. Some sit up, if they can find a dry 
spot to sit on, and smoke. Heartless observations are 
made. A few sleep. And the night wears on. The 
morning opens cheerless. The sky is still leaking, 
and so is the shanty. The guides bring in a half^ 
cooked breakfast. The roof is patched up. There 





are reviving signs of breaking away, delusive signs 
that create momentary exhilaration. Even if the 
storm clears, the woods are soaked. There is no 
chance of stirring. The world is only ten feet square. 

This life, without responsibility or clean clothes^ 
may continue as long as the reader desires. There 
are those who would like to live in this free fashion 
forever, taking rain and sun as heaven pleases ; and 
there are some souls so constituted that they cannot 
exist more than three days without their worldly bag- 
gage. Taking the party altogether, from one cause 
or another it is likely to strike camp sooner than was 
intended. And the stricken camp is a melancholy 
sight. The woods have been despoiled ; the stumps 
are ugly ; the bushes are scorched ; the pine-leaf-strewn 
earth is trodden into mire ; the landing looks like a 
cattle-ford ; the ground is littered with all the un- 
sightly debris of a hand-to-hand life ; the dismantled 
shanty is a shabby object ; the charred and blackened 
logs, where the fire blazed, suggest the extinction of 
family life. Man has wrought his usual wrong upon 
Nature, and he can save his self-respect only by mov- 
ing to virgin forests. 

And move to them he will, the next season, if not 
this. For he who has once experienced the fascina- 
tion of the woods-life never escapes its enticement : in 
the. memory nothing remains but its charm. 



\ 



A WILDERNESS EOMAXCE 



At the south end of Keene Valley, in the Adiron- 
dacks, stands Noon Mark, a shapely peak, thirty-five 
hundred feet above the sea, which, with the aid of the 
sun, tells the Keene people when it is time to eat din- 
ner. From its summit you look south into a vast wil- 
derness basin, a great stretch of forest little trodden, 
and out of whose bosom you can hear from the 
heights on a still day the loud murmur of Boqtret. 
This basin of unbroken green rises away to the south 
and south-east into the rocky heights of Dix's Peak 
and Nipple Top, — the latter a local name which 
neither the mountain nor the fastidious tourist is able 
to shake off. Indeed, so long as the mountain keeps 
its present shape as seen from the southern lowlands, 
it cannot get on without this name. 

These two mountains, which belong to the great 
system of which Marcy is the giant centre, and are in 
the neighborhood of five thousand feet high, on the 
southern outposts of the great mountains, form the 
gate-posts of the pass into the south country. This 
opening between them is called Hunter's Pass. It is 
the most elevated and one of the wildest of the moun- 
tain passes. Its summit is thirty-five hundred feet 
high. In former years it is presumed the hunters oc- 
casionally followed the game through ; but latterly it 
is rare to find a guide who has been that way, and the 



 

tin-can and paper-collar tourists have not yet made it 
a runway. This seclusion is due not to any inherent 
difficulty of travel, but to the fact that it lies a little 
out of the way. 

We went through it last summer ; making our way 
into the jaws from the foot of the great slides on Dix, 
keeping along the ragged spurs of the mountain 
through the virgin forest. The pass is narrow, walled 
in on each side by precipices of granite, and blocked 
up with the bowlders and fallen trees, and beset with 
pitfalls in the roads ingeniously covered with fair- 
seeming moss. When the climber occasionally loses 
sight of a leg in one of those treacherous holes, and 
feels a cold sensation in his foot, he learns that he has 
dipped into the sources of the Boquet, which emerges 
lower down into falls and rapids, and, recruited by 
creeping tributaries, goes brawling through the forest 
basin, and at last comes out an amiable and boat-bear- 
ing stream in the valley of Elizabeth Town. From 
the summit another rivulet trickles away to the south, 
and finds its way through a frightful tamarack swamp, 
and through woods scarred by ruthless lumbering, to 
Mud Pond, a quiet body of water, with a ghastly 
fringe of dead trees, upon which people of grand in- 
tentions and weak vocabulary are trying to fix the 
name of Elk Lake. The descent of the pass on that 
side is precipitous and exciting. The way is in the 
stream itself ; and a considerable portion of the dis- 
tance we swung ourselves down the faces of consider- 
able falls, and tumbled down cascades. The descent, 
however, was made easy by the fact that it rained, 
and every footstep was yielding and slippery. Why 
sane people, often church-members respectably con- 
nected, will subject themselves to this sort of treat- 





ment, — be wet to the skin, bruised by the rocks, and 
flung about among the bushes and dead wood until 
the most necessary part of their apparel hangs in 
shreds, — is one of the delightful mysteries of these 
woods. I suspect that every man is at heart a rov= 
ing animal, and likes, at intervals, to revert to the 
condition of the bear and the catamount. 

There is no trail through Hunter's Pass, which, as 
I have intimated, is the least frequented portion of 
this wilderness. Yet we were surprised to find a 
well-beaten path a considerable portion of the way 
and wherever a path is possible. It was not a mere 
deer's runway : these are found everywhere in the 
mountains. It is trodden by other and larger ani- 
mals, and is, no doubt, the highway of beasts. It 
bears marks of having been so for a long period, and 
probably a period long ago. Large animals are not 
common in these woods now, and you seldom meet 
any thing fiercer than the timid deer and the gentle 
bear. But in days gone by Hunter's Pass was the 
highway of the whole caravan of animals who were 
continually going backwards and forwards, in the 
aimless, roaming way that beasts have, between Mud 
Pond and the Boquet Basin. I think I can see now 
the procession of them between the heights of Dix and 
Nipple Top ; the elk and the moose shambling along, 
cropping the twigs ; the heavy bear lounging by with 
his exploring nose ; the frightened deer trembling at 
every twig that snapped beneath his little hoofs, in- 
tent on the lily-pads of the pond ; the raccoon and the 
hedgehog, sidling along ; and the velvet-footed pan- 
ther, insouciant and conscienceless, scenting the path 
with a curious glow in his eye, or crouching in an 
overhanging tree ready to drop into the procession at 



 

the right moment. Night and day, year after year, 
I see them going by, watched by the red fox and the 
comfortably clad sable, and grinned at by the black 
cat, — the innocent, the vicious, the timid and the 
savage, the shy and the bold, the chattering slanderer 
and the screaming prowler, the industrious and the 
peaceful, the tree-top critic and the crawling biter, — 
just as it is elsewhere. It makes me blush for my 
species when I think of it. This charming society is 
nearly extinct now : of the larger animals there only 
remain the bear, who minds his own business more 
thoroughly than any person I know, and the deer, 
who would like to be friendly with men, but whose 
winning face and gentle ways are no protection from 
the savageness of man, and who is treated with the 
same unpitying destruction as the snarling catamount. 
I have read in history that the amiable natives of 
Hispaniola fared no better at the hands of the brutal 
Spaniards than the fierce and warlike Caribs. As so- 
ciety is at present constituted in Christian countries, 
I would rather for my own security be a cougar than 
a fawn. 

There is not much of romantic interest in the Adi- 
rondacks. Out of the books of daring travellers, 
nothing. I do not know that the Keene Valley has 
any history. The mountains always stood here, and 
the Ausable, flowing now in shallows and now in rip- 
pling reaches over the sands and pebbles, has for ages 
filled the air with continuous and soothing sounds. 
Before the Vermonters broke into it some three-quar- 
ters of a century ago, and made meadows of its bot- 
toms and sugar-camps of its fringing woods, I sup- 
pose the red Indian lived here in his usual discom- 
fort, and was as restless as his successors, the summer 





boarders. But the streams were full of trout then, 
and the moose and the elk left their broad tracks on 
the sands of the river. But of the Indian there is no 
trace. There is a mound in the valley, much like 
a Tel in the country of Bashan beyond the Jordan, 
that may have been built by some prehistoric race, 
and may contain treasure and the seated figure of 
a preserved chieftain on his slow way to Paradise. 
What the gentle and accomplished race of the Mound- 
Builders should want in this savage region, where the 
frost hills the early potatoes and stunts the scanty 
oats, I do not know. I have seen no trace of therriy 
except this Tel, and one other slight relic, which came 
to light last summer, and is not enough to found the 
history of a race upon. 

Some workingmen, getting stone from the hillside 
on one of the little plateaus for a house-cellar, discov- 
ered, partly embedded, a piece of pottery unique in 
this region. With the unerring instinct of workmen 
in regard to antiquities, they thrust a crowbar through 
it, and broke the bowl into several pieces. The joint 
fragments, however, give us the form of a dish. It 
is a bowl about nine inches high and eight inches 
across, made of red clay, baked but not glazed. The 
bottom is round, the top flares into four corners, and 
the rim is rudely but rather artistically ornamented 
with criss-cross scratches made when the clay was 
soft. The vessel is made of clay not found about 
here, and it is one that the Indians formerly living 
here could not form. Was it brought here by rov- 
ing Indians who may have made an expedition to 
the Ohio ; was it passed from tribe to tribe ; or did it 
belong to a race that occupied the country before the 
Indian, and who have left traces of their civilized 
skill in pottery scattered all over the continent ? 



 

If I could establish the fact that this jar was made 
by a prehistoric race, we should then have four gen- 
erations in this lovely valley: the amiable Prehis- 
toric people (whose gentle descendants were probably 
killed by the Spaniards in the West Indies) ; the Red 
Indians ; the Keene Flaters (from Vermont) ; and 
the Summer Boarders, to say nothing of the various 
races of animals who have been unable to live here 
since the advent of the Summer Boarders, the valley 
being not productive enough to sustain both. This 
last incursion has been more destructive to the noble 
serenity of the forest than all the preceding. 

But we are wandering from Hunter's Pass. The 
western walls of it are formed by the precipices of 
Nipple Top, not so striking nor so bare as the great 
slides of Dix, which glisten in the sun like silver, but 
rough and repelling, and consequently alluring. I 
have a great desire to scale them. I have always had 
an unreasonable wish to explore the rough summit of 
this crabbed hill, which is too broken and jagged for 
pleasure, and not high enough for glory. This desire 
was stimulated by a legend related by our guide that 
night in the Mud Pond cabin. The guide had nevei- 
been through the pass before ; although he was famil- 
iar with the region, and had ascended Nipple Top in 
the winter in pursuit of the sable. The story he told 
doesn't amount to much, — none of the guides' stories 
do, faithfully reported, — and I should not have be- 
lieved it if I had not had a good deal of leisure on my 
hands at the time, and been of a willing mind, and 
I may say in rather a starved condition as to any 
romance in this region. 

The guide said then — and he mentioned it casu- 
ally, in reply to our inquiries about ascending the 





mountain — that there was a cave high up among the 
precipices on the southeast side of Nipple Top. He 
scarcely volunteered the information, and with seem- 
ing reluctance gave us any particulars about it. I 
always admire this art by which the accomplished 
story-teller lets his listener drag the reluctant tale of 
the marvellous from him, and makes you in a manner 
responsible for its improbability. If this is well-man- 
aged, the listener is always eager to believe a great 
deal more than the romancer seems willing to tell, 
and always resents the assumed reservations and 
doubts of the latter. 

There were strange reports about this cave when 
the old guide was a boy, and even then its very exist- 
ence had become legendary. Nobody knew exactly 
where it was, but there was no doubt that it had been 
inhabited. Hunters in the forests south of Dix had 
seen a light late at night twinkling through the trees 
high up the mountain, and now and then a ruddy glare 
as from the flaring-up of a furnace. Settlers were few 
in the wilderness then, and all the inhabitants were 
well known. If the cave was inhabited, it must be by 
strangers, and by men who had some secret purpose 
in seeking this seclusion and eluding observation. If 
suspicious characters were seen about Port Henry, or 
if any such landed from the steamers on the shore of 
Lake Champlain, it was impossible to identify them 
with these invaders who were never seen. Their not 
being seen did not, however, prevent the growth of 
the belief in their existence. Little indications and 
rumors, each trivial in itself, became a mass of testi- 
mony that could not be disposed of because of its 
very indefiniteness, but which appealed strongly to 
man's noblest faculty, his imagination, or credulity. 



 

The cave existed ; and it was inhabited by men 
who came and went on mysterious errands, and trans- 
acted their business by night. What this band of 
adventurers or desperadoes lived on, how they con= 
veyed their food through the trackless woods to their 
high eyrie, and what could induce men to seek such 
a retreat, were questions discussed, but never settled. 
They might be banditti ; but there was nothing to 
plunder in these savage wilds, and, in fact, robberies 
and raids, either in the settlements of the hills or the 
distant lake shores were unknown. In another age, 
these might have been hermits, holy men who had 
retired from the world to feed the vanity of their god- 
liness in a spot where they were subject neither to 
interruption nor comparison; they would have had 
a shrine in the cave, and an image of the Blessed Vir- 
gin, with a lamp always burning before it and send- 
ing out its mellow light over the savage waste. A 
more probable notion was that they were romantic 
Frenchmen who had grown weary of vice and refine- 
ment together, — possibly princes, expectants of the 
throne, Bourbon remainders, named Williams or oth- 
erwise, unhatched eggs, so to speak, of kings, who had 
withdrav/n out of observation to wait for the next 
turn-over in Paris. Frenchmen do such things. If 
they were not Frenchmen, they might be horse-thieves 
or criminals, escaped from justice or from the friendly 
state-prison of New York. This last supposition was, 
however, more violent than the others, or seems so to 
us in this day of grace. For what well-brought-up 
New York criminal would be so insane as to run away 
from his political friends the keepers, from the easily- 
had companionship of his pals outside, and from the 
society of his criminal lawyer, and, in short, to put 





himself into the depths of a wilderness out of which 
escape, when escape was desired, is a good deal more 
difficult than it is out of the swarming* jails of the 
Empire State ? Besides, how foolish for a man, if he 
were a really hardened and professional criminal, hav- 
ing established connections and a regular business, to 
run away from the governor's pardon, which might 
have difficulty in finding him in the craggy bosom of 
Nipple Top ! 

This gang of men — there is some doubt whether 
they were accompanied by women — gave little evi- 
dence in their appearance of being escaped criminals 
or expectant kings. Their movements were myste^ 
rious, but not necessarily violent. If their occupation 
could have been discovered, that would have furnished 
a clue to their true character. But about this the 
strangers were as close as mice. If anything could 
betray them, it was the steady light from the cavern, 
and its occasional ruddy flashing. This gave rise to 
the opinion, which was strengthened by a good many 
indications equally conclusive, that the cave was the 
resort of a gang of coiners and counterfeiters. Here 
they had their furnace, smelting-pots, and dies ; here 
they manufactured those spurious quarters and halves 
that their confidants, who were pardoned, were circulating, and which a few honest men were " nailing to 
the counter." 

This prosaic explanation of a romantic situation 
satisfies all the requirements of the known facts, but 
the lively imagination at once rejects it as unworthy 
of the subject. I think the guide put it forward in 
order to have it rejected. The fact is, — at least, it 
has never been disproved, — these strangers whose 
movements were veiled belonged to that dark and 



 

mysterious race whose presence anywhere on this con- 
tinent is a nest-egg of romance or of terror. They 
were Spaniards ! You need not say buccaneers, you 
need not say gold-hunters, you need not say swarthy 
adventurers even : it is enough to say Spaniards I 
There is no tale of mystery and fanaticism and daring 
I would not believe if a Spaniard is the hero of it, 
and it is not necessary either that he should have the 
high-sounding name of Bobadilla or Ojeda. 

Nobody, I suppose, would doubt this story, if the 
cave were in the mountains of Ilispaniola or in the 
Florida Keys. But a Spaniard in the Adirondacks 
does seem misplaced. Well, there w^ould be no ro- 
mance about it if he were not misplaced. The Span- 
iard, anyw^here out of Spain, has always been mis- 
placed. What could draw him to this loggy and re- 
mote region? There are two substances that will 
draw a Spaniard from any distance as certainly as 
sugar will draw wasps, — gold and silver. Does the 
reader begin to see light ? There was a rumor that 
silver existed in these mountains. I do not know 
where the rumor came from, but it is necessary to 
account for the Spaniards in the cave. 

How long these greedy Spaniards occupied the cave 
on Nipple Top is not known, nor how much silver 
they found, whether they found any, or whether they 
secretly took away all there was in the hills. That 
they discovered silver in considerable quantities is a 
fair inference from the length of their residence in 
this mountain, and the extreme care they took to 
guard their secret, and the mystery that enveloped all 
their movements. What they mined, they smelted 
in the cave and carried off with them. 

To my imagination nothing is more impressive than 





the presence in these savage wilds of these polished 
foreigners and accomplished metallurgists, far from 
the haunts of civilized man, leading a life of luxury 
and revelry in this almost inaccessible cavern. I can 
see them seated about their roaring fire, which revealed the rocky ribs of their den and sent a gleam 
over the dark forest, eating venison-pasty and cutting 
deep into the juicy haunch of the moose, quaffing deep 
draughts of red wine from silver tankards, and then 
throwing themselves back upon divans, and lazily puffing the fragrant Havana. After a day of toil, what 
more natural, and what more probable for a Spaniard? 
Does the reader think these inferences not war- 
ranted by the facts ? He does not know the facts. 
It is true that our guide had never himself personally 
visited the cave, but he has always intended to hunt 
it up. His information in regard to it comes from 
his father, who was a mighty hunter and trapper. 
In one of his expeditions over Nipple Top, he chanced 
upon the cave. The mouth was half concealed by 
undergrowth. He entered, not without some apprehension engendered by the legends which make it famous. I think he showed some boldness in venturing 
into such a place alone. I confess, that, before I went 
in, I should want to fire a Gatling gun into the mouth 
for a little while, in order to rout out the bears which 
usually dwell there. He went in, however. The en- 
trance was low ; but the cave was spacious, not large, 
but big enough, with a level floor and a vaulted ceil- 
ing. It had long been deserted, but that it was once 
the residence of highly civilized beings there could be 
no doubt. The dead brands in the centre were the 
remains of a fire that could not have been kindled by 
wild beasts, and the bones scattered about had been 



 

scientifically dissected and handled. There were also 
remnants of furniture and pieces of garments scat- 
tered about. At the further end, in a fissure of the 
rock, were stones regularly built up, the remains of a 
larger fire, — and what the hunter did not doubt was
