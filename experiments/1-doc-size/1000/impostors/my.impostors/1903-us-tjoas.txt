I read that over just now. Yes, it is this that 
I dread. I dread the habit of not striving! When 
that becomes my habit it is my death! And here 
I sit, day by day — doing just the thing I dread! 
" Let me go now! " something shouts in me. 
"Now — or I shall never go at all! " 

Oh, if I could find some word to tell men the 
terror of that thought! 

— It is my life — that is what it is! To obey 
this thing within me, to save this thing within 
me, to find this thing within me — that is my life ! 

It is a demon thing — it is a thing that has 
lifted me up by the hair of my head and shaken 
me — that has glared at me with the wild eyes of 
a beast — that has beaten me like a storm of wind 
and struck me down upon the ground! It shakes 
me now — it shakes me all the time — it makes me 
scream with pain — incoherently, frantically. 
" Oh save me! — Spare me! — Let me go! " 

I rave, you say — yes, I know. That is because 
I can not say what I feel. But what matters it? 

Sometimes I say to myself, " I put all that in 
The Captive, and men have not heard it! And 

now, what can I do that they will hear — shall I 
have to go out in the streets and scream? Or 
what other desperate thing is there? " 

— Mark this, oh you world that I can not 
make hear me! Some desperate thing I shall do 
— I will not sit here and be respectable always! 

— I wonder what locusts taste like, and just 
where one could find wild honey. 

October 29th. 
I sang a song to-day — a mad, mad song! I 
wish I could bring it back. It came to me un- 
expectedly, while I was kneeling by the bed, 
thinking. 

I have forgotten it all now — one always for- 
gets his best songs. I have not a line of this one, 
except the chorus: 

For I am lord of a thousand dollars ! 

So it is that my best songs go. I can count 
them on my fingers. But I have not yet learned 
how precious they are — that is why I lose them. 

— Do you remember that time on the great 
clififs by the ocean? There was nothing left but 
the ending again — 

Oh bear me away in thy bosom. 
Thou wind of the mountain high ! 





November 2d. 

I am not always as I write here — I am not 
always angry. I have my tender moments, when 
I see my woe as the world's woe — above all the 
poverty. Oh let me always have a tender heart 
for the poor! 

November 6th. 

I have a distant relative in this city, an old 
gentleman who belongs to clubs and is what is 
known as a " man of the world." He has quite 
a sense of humor — is famous for good stories. 
He told me that he was interested in me — that he 
would be glad to find a place for me in life, if I 
would only get over my youthful follies. It has 
been years since I saw him, but I can still hear 
him. 

The last words he ever said to me were these 
— said with his quiet, amused smile: " Never 
mind, my boy, leave it to time. You needn't 
argue with me — just leave it to time, and it'll 
come out all right." 

Never have I sunk into a fit of despair that 
I have not thought of that; and the quiet smile 
has become the sneer of an imp. It has become 
all the world watching me, and knowing full well 
the issue; wise world! 


That memory has never yet lost its power to 
make me grip my hands suddenly. " So! And 
my life has no other purpose, then, than to point 
a moral for a rich clubman! " 

Leave it to time! Leave it to time! O God, 
what a sentence that is — so savage — and so true! 
Leave it to the long weary days that come one 
after another — that never tire — that never are 
beaten — that never are less — never faster — never 
slower — that wear you out as water wears a 
stone! Leave it to time! Say nothing, fear 
nothing; leave it to time! Leave it to the hours 
of dulness, the hours of sickness, the hours of de- 
spair! Leave it to failure piled upon failure, 
to insult piled upon insult, to rebuff upon rebuff, 
to sneer upon sneer! Leave it to the endless, 
never-ceasing sight of ugliness; the endless, 
never-ceasing sight of selfishness; of pettiness, 
emptiness, heartlessness, hatefulness! Leave it 
to heat and to cold, to dust and to dirt, to hun- 
ger and penury, to headache and heartache, and 
bitter, bitter loneliness! Leave it to time! Leave 
it to time! — Oh my Father in heaven! 

November 8th. 
— What am I doing? I am reading books full 






of facts — I am reading books that do not make 
me wretched. I am not reading poetry. 
I am leaving it to time ! 

November loth. 

It has been four weeks yesterday! I have 
been expecting to hear from the last publishers 
every day for a week. I have been trembling 
while I watched each mail. I have more than a 
hope that these publishers will take it — they pub- 
lish a deal of poetry. 

But I have been practising my friend's plan, 
I have been saying to myself all day: "You 
might as well know that it is coming back. What 
is the use of trying to deceive yourself? " 

It has been four months since I finished The 
Captive ! If I had known then what I know now, 
I do not believe I could ever have written a line 
of it. 

What do I know now? 

— I know more than I care to own to my- 
self. There is a deadly growth taking root in the 
depths of my soul. 

November 13th. 
It is two months to-day since I gave up my 
last place. I have gotten along on just three dol- 

lars a week, including everything. I find it is not 
possible to do better than that, there are so many 
odds and ends one needs. I have spent twenty- 
seven dollars. I have twenty-nine dollars. That 
means I can try two, or possibly three, pub- 
lishers — after this one. 

November i6th. 
My method did make it easier after all. The 
letter came this morning. 

" We have read with care the manuscript of 
The Captive which you have offered us. We are 
pleased to be able to tell you that we have found 
it a very fine piece of work, but we are sorry to 
say that our previous experience with publica- 
tions of this character does not lead us to believe 
that we could make a success of it. 

" We are holding MS. subject to your order." 

I did a desperate thing to-day — two of them. 
First I had to go and get the manuscript, so I 
asked to see the publisher. I sat down and looked 
straight into his face and said: " How is a man 
who is trying to write what is fine to keep alive 
if the publishers won't publish what he writes? " 

He was very kind — he seemed to be inter- 







ested. He explained that a publisher who pub- 
lished books that the public did not want would 
be driven out of business in a year. Then he said 
he knew many who were facing the same problem 
as I : that there was nothing to do but sxite for 
the magazines and the papers, and that it was a 
bitter shame that society made no provision for 
such men. " Your work is as noble and sincere 
as work can be," he said, " but I do not believe 
that you will find a publisher in this country to 
undertake it. unless tliere be one who feels 
wealthy enough to do it as a se•ice to litera- 
ture and a labor of love." 

That made me turn white. I got my manu- 
script and I went out on the street, and tlie houses 
reeled about me. " So." I said, " and that set- 
tles it: " 

As I walked along I stared into the future. 
It seemed very- clear all of a sudden. 

I thought it all out. " Xo one will publish 
The Captive," I said, " and no one would heed it 
if it were published. Therefore I have but one 
question to face. Have I the strength to go on, 
living as I have lived, distracted and tormented 
as I have been — and still piling up new emotions 


in my soul, daring new eiiforts, reaching new 
heights, producing new books? I can have no 
idea that my second work will be any more avail- 
able than my first; on the contrary, I know that 
it would be just what The Captive is, only more 
so. Therefore, perhaps it will be ten years — per- 
haps it will be twenty years — before men begin to 
pay any heed to what I have written! And so 
there is the question. Have I the strength to go 
on in that way — have I the strength to face that 
future? " 

Then I grew faint and had to lean against a 
railing. I knew that I could not do that! 

It is no question of what I will do! It is a 
question of what I can do! I am weakened and 
sick with the yearning that I have in me already. 
My -last " business " experience drove me mad. 
And I am to go on, I am to rouse new hunger, 
new passion, new agony in my soul! Why, the 
work that I have dreamed of next is so hard and 
so far-away that I hardly dared even whisper it! 
It would take years and years of toiling! And I 
am to do it here in this seething city — to do it 
while I sell wholesale-paper — to do it while I am 
sick for lack of food! I can not do it! I cow not! 






I went home, and I was crazy; so it was that 
I did my second desperate thing. 

I sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. . 

I wrote a letter — I can not see how it could fail 
to stir the soul of any man. I told him how I 
had toiled — I told him how for four long months 
I had waited in agony — I told him what the pub- 
lishers had said to me. I begged him — I im- 
plored him — for the sake of the unuttered mes- 
sage that cried out day and night in my soul — 
not to throw the letter aside — to read it — to give 
me a chance to talk to him. I said : " I will live 
in a hut, I will cook my own food, I will wear the 
clothes of a day laborer! If I can only be free — if 
I can only be free to be an artist! I could do it, 
all of it, for two hundred dollars a year; and I 
could win the battle, I know, if I had but three 
years. I am desperate as I write to you — I look 
ahead and I can see only ruin; and not ruin for 
myself — I do not mind that — but ruin for my art ! 
I can tell you what that means to me in but 
one way — I ask you to read my book. I have 
put all my soul into that book — I will stake my 
all upon it. If you will only read it, you will see 
what I mean — you will see why I have written 
you this letter. You will see that it is not a beg- 




gar's letter, but a high challenge from an artist's 
soul." 

So there is one chance more. I do not see 
how he can refuse, and if he will only read the 
manuscript, I will be safe, I think. 

November 20th. 

I have done nothing but wait for four days, 
but I have not heard from him yet. To-day I 
made up my mind that I would take the manu- 
script to another publisher's meanwhile. He is 
probably busy, and may not answer for a long 
while; and I can get the manuscript from a pub- 
lisher at any time. 

November 24th. 

Still I have not heard anything from Mr. 

. My soul was full of hope again, but it is 

sinking down as before. Is he not going to 
answer me at all? — Can it be that he has not 
even read my letter? 

November 26th. 

I wrote to him again to-day, inquiring. If 
he does not answer that, I shall suppose his 
secretary threw it away. 

There is nothing weakens my soul like this 
endless waiting. I wander around desolate, help- 






less. I can not fix my mind on anything. Oh, 
the shame of it! 

November 30th. 
I could not give up that hope yet. It seemed 
to me so terrible that of all the men of wealth in 
this city there should not be one willing to help 
me save my message. — I wrote to-day the same 
letter to a clergyman who I know is wealthy, and 
who I believe would be interested in my work. 

December 2d. 
" I have received your letter, and I regret 
very much that I can not grant the request you 
make. The pressure upon my time is such that I 
can not possibly undertake to read your book. 
There would be no use in my doing so, anyhow, 
for I tell you frankly it seems to me the situation 
you are in is just what you need. My advice to 
you is to be a man and face it. I do not see any 
reason why one person should be set free from 
the labor which all of us have to share; and I 
assure you that you are entirely mistaken if you 
think that an artist has nothing to expect but 
ruin from contact with the world, and with suf- 
fering and toiling humanity." 

Isn't that a slap in the face for you? 


Great God, I think that is the most insulting 
thing that has ever happened to me in all my days. 
" Set free from the labor which all of us have to 
share! "' — What do you think I am — a tramp, or 
a loafer, )'ou hound! 

" A high challenge from an artist's soul! " 

I think I never had so much hatred in my 
heart in all my life as I have to-daj-. Oh, my God, 
what a thing this world is! What stupid, blind 
brutahty, what hideous vulgarity! This man a 
clergyman! And this is his faith, his nobility, his 
understanding! 

Why, I came out of the forest with my naked 
heart in my hands! I came out quivering with 
emotion, melting with love and with trust for all 
men! I came all sensitive and raw — hunger- 
ing for sympathy and kindness! And oh, my 
soul ! — my God ! — you have beaten me and kicked 
me as if I were a filthy cur! 

Had I not offered up my heart for a sacrifice? 
Had I not. burned it with fire? Had I not made 
all m)- being one consecration? And all for men, 
for men! For men I had torn myself — lashed 
myself — killed myself — for men I had forgotten 
what self was — yes, literally that — forgotten what 
self was! So little self had I left that I was will- 



ing to ask favors! So much consecration had I, 
so much trust, that I would beg! I had wept — 
I had suffered — I had starved! I had dreamed 
and sung, toiled until I set fire to my very brain! 
And you have beaten me and kicked me as if I 
were a filthy cur! 

Those thoughts turn my whole soul into one 
wild curse! Have done with laying bare your 
heart to men, have done with telling your life 
to men! Why should you go on trying to be a 
poet, go on putting your secret soul into books, 
to be spurned at by the rabble? Your soul is 
your own — it is your God's — and what have the 
rabble to do with it! And all its tenderness! all 
its shrinking ecstasy! all its holiest consecration! 
— You will take them out to sell them to the 
rabble! 

When will you get back into yourself, you 
fool? When will you have learned your lesson, 
and let this hellish world boot you out of its way 
no more? Let ever any man know a gleam of 
your heart again! — see one trace of your joy! 

— And I came to it on my knees — to this 
world — crouching, cringing, begging! Oh, oh! 
— I scream it — Oh! 



— And after that I sank down by the bed and 
hid my face and sobbed: " Oh, Shelley! Oh, my 
Shelley! " 

December 3d. 

— I saw myself a business man to-day, clearing 
a path for myself! But it does not last — I am not 
that kind of a man. My folly is my being — rest 
assured that I shall climb back to the heights 
again where I am willing to bear any insult. 

But it will be a long time before I write any 
more letters. I have come to understand the 
world's point of view. 

I suppose busy men get thousands of letters 
from cranks; they will get no more from me. 

December 5th. 

I was reading an essay on Balzac to-day. I 
read about Balzac's fondness for things; and I 
put the book down and spent an hour of perplex- 
ity. I fear I am a very narrow person in my sym- 
pathies and understandings. Why should a man 
care about things! About all sorts of houses and 
furniture, and pictures, and clothes, and jewels! 

I can understand a man's caring about love 
and joy and aspiration. But things! I can 


understand a child's caring about things, or a 
fool's caring; I see millions of such; but an art- 
ist? A thinker? A man? 



I am reading novels nowadays — reading all 
sorts of things that entertain. I have not read a 
poem for a long time, I have no interest in read- 
ing unless I can go with it. 

I have been studying some of the French 
novelists — some of Maupassant yesterday. What 
a strange creature is a Frenchman! A nervous, 
hysterical, vain, diseased creature ! 

" The Gallic disease! " Let that be a phrase. 

The Gallic disease is this: to see only one 
thing in life, to know only one purpose, to under- 
stand only one pleasure; to have every road lead 
to that, every thought, every phrase. To know 
that every character in a book is thinking it; to 
know that every man who is introduced is look- 
ing for a woman ! And that as soon as he finds 
her, they must forthwith — whatever be their age, 
rank, character, and position at the moment — be- 
gin to burn with unclean desires! 

That is what one might call the convention of 


French fiction. It gets very monotonous when 
you are used to it; it takes all of the interest out 
of the story. For there is but one ending to such 
a story. 

One's whole being is lowered by contact with 
that incessant animal appeal. 

December 8th. 

I have discovered another trouble — as if I did 
not have enough! I am to suffer from indiges- 
tion! It plagues me continuously — I can not do 
anything for an hour after a meal, no matter what 
simplest thing I have eaten. 

And so all through my life I am to be hin- 
dered in my work by having to wrestle with this 
handicap ! Just as if I had not been a clean man, 
but some vulgar bon vivant. 

December loth. 

This is my fifth publisher. They said they 
thought it would take two weeks, but it has been 
three already, and they have not even answered 
my letter of inquiry. I see you can put no reli- 
ance on them in the matter of time. 

December nth. 
In two days more it will be three months since 
I gave up my situation. I count my little hoard 


day by day, as a castaway might, or a besieged 
garrison. I have begun to try to get along on 
cheap foods again — (that is the reason of my in- 
digestion). Yesterday I burned a mess of oat- 
meal, and now I shall live on burned oatmeal for 
I know not how long. I was cooking a large 
quantity to save time. 

I count my store. I have come the last 
month on eleven dollars ! I have been doing my 
own washing, and reading the newspapers at a 
library. I buy nothing but food — chiefly bread 
and milk and cereals. Why is it that everything 
that is cheap has no taste? 

Sometimes I am angry because I can not 
have anything good to eat, but I only write my 
dignified sentiments here. 

I am getting down to the limit again; I sit 
shuddering. I shall have to get some work 
again; I can not bear to think of it! What shall 
I do? If I go to that slavery again it will be the 
death of my soul, for I have no hope, and I can 
not fight as I did before. 

And I can only try one or two publishers 
more. Oh, take it! Take it! 


December 14th. 

I went down to see them to-day. The manu- 
script mislaid — very sorry — had written readers 
to examine it at once — expecting report any in- 
stant — will write me — etc. 

And so I walked home again. 

Yes, elegant ladies and gentlemen, I am a 
poor poet; and my overcoat is out at one elbow, 
and I am sick. I look preoccupied, too; would 
you like, perhaps, to know what is in my mind? 
I will tell you five minutes of it to-day: 

" Bang! Bang! Look out of the way there, 
you fool ! — Use Casey's Corn Cure ! — Extry ! Ex- 
try! Evening Slop-Bucket and Swill-Barrel, six 
o'clock edition! — And it was at seventy-two and 
the market — Cab! Cab! — Try Jones's Little 
Five-cent Cigars! — Brown's Elite Tonsorial and 
Shaving Parlors! — Have you seen Lucy Legs in 
the High Kicker? The Daily Hullabaloo says — 
Shine, boss? — But she wouldn't cut it on the bias, 
because she thought — Read the Evening Slop- 
Bucket! Five hundred million copies sold every 
year! We rake all the mud-gutters and it only 
costs you one cent! The Slop-Bucket is the paper
of the people! — Move along, young man, 
don't block up the passage! Bang! Bang! 
Hurry up there, if you want to get aboard — 
Come along, my honey-baby girl ! (hand-organ) — 
If you will try Superba Soap — Simpkins's Whis- 
ky is all the rage! — Isaac Cohenstein's Cash 
Clothing Store, Bargains in Gents' Fall Over- 
coats! Look at these! Walk in, sir! Cash! 
Cash! — The most elegant topaz brooches, with 
little — Read the Daily Swill-Barrel! — Extry! 
Extry! He Cut Her Throat with a Carving- 
Knife! — Bang! Bang! — Toodles' Teething Sir- 
up — Look at my elegant hat with the flamin- 
go on it! — O'Reilly's Restaurant — walk in and 
gorge yourself, if you can pay us. Walk in! — 
Get out of the way there! — Have you read the 
Pirate's Pledge! The Literary Sensation — Cash! 
Cash! — Just come and see our wonderful dis- 
play of newly imported — Smith and Robinson, 
Diamonds and Jewelry, latest and most elegant — 
Use Tompkins's Tooth Powder ! Use Tompkins's 
Tooth Powder!! USE TOMPKINS'S— Read the 
Evening Slop-Bucket! We rake all the mud- 
gutters! — Murphy's Wines and Liquors — Try 
Peerless Cocktails — Levy's High-Class Clothing 
Emporium ! — Come in and buy something — anything
— we get down on our knees — we beg you ! 
— Cab, sir? Cab! — Bargains! Bargains! — Cash! 
Cash! — Yein, yein, yeiii!" 

So it keeps up for hours! And I put my fin- 
gers in my ears and run. 

December 17th. 

To-day I happened to read in one of the mag- 
azines an article on a Hterary subject by a college 
professor of some reputation. It was a fine piece 
of work, I thought, very true ; and I got to think- 
ing of him, wondering if he might not be the man. 

I have no hope that these last publishers will 
take the book, and so I made up my mind to 
write to him. 

I wrote what I had written to all the others; 
I told him how I had struggled, and how I was 
living. Perhaps he is less busy than the rest. 

December 19th. 
The manuscript came back to-day. The let- 
ter was simple — the old, meaningless form. I 
am waiting to hear from the professor. 

December 20th. 
" I reply to your letter somewhat against my 
rule — chiefly because of what you tell me about 

your circumstances. I will read your manuscript 
if you still think it worth while to send it to me; 
but I must tell you at the outset that I consider 
the chances very unfavorable, as regards my find- 
ing the work what you believe it. I assure you 
that the literary situation is not in the least 
what you picture it; the book-market was never 
more wide-awake than it is now, the publishers 
are all as eager as possible for the least sign of 
new power; and besides that, the magazines af- 
ford outlet — not only for talent, but for medi- 
ocrity as well. You are entirely mistaken in 
your idea that literary excellence is not equiva- 
lent to commercial availability. If you could 
write one paragraph as noble as the average of 
Dr. , or one stanza as excellent as the aver- 
age of Professor , you would find an instant 

and hearty welcome. 

" Moreover, I believe that you are entirely 
wrong in your ideas of what you need. You will 
not make yourself a great artist by secluding 
yourself from men — go out into the world, young 
man, go out into the world and see what men 
are! 

" As I say, it is not my rule to answer letters 
such as yours. The cry of the suffering is in the 


air every instant, if we heeded it we should 
never get our work done. But I am willing to 
read your poem, if this letter has not chilled your 
ardor." 

— Last night I read The Captive again, and 
it brought the tears into my eyes; and so my ar- 
dor is not chilled, good professor — and I will 
send you the poem. 

— But as for going out into the world — I 
think I am learning what men are pretty fast! 

December 23d. 

My poem stirs me, but it does not last. My 
whole habit of mind seems to me to be changed 
— a deep, settled melancholy has come over me; 
I go about mournful, haunted. I read — but all 
the time I am as if I had forgotten something, 
and as if half my mind were on that. I have lost 
all my ardor — I look back at what I was, and it 
brings the tears into my eyes. It is gone! It is 
gone! It will not ever come back! 

And each day I am drawing nearer to the 
rapids — to the ghastly prospect of having to 
drag myself back to work! 


Oh my God, what shall I do? — tell me any- 
thing, and I will do it! Give me a hope — any 
hope — even a little one! 

The last day I can stretch my miserable pit- 
tance to is the first of February. 

December 25th. 
Christmas Day — and I have no news, ex- 
cept that I am hungry, and that I am sitting in 
my room with a blanket around me, and with a 
miserable cold in my head. 

It is the agony of an unheated room, an old 
acquaintance of mine, that comes with each bit- 
ter winter. I live in a house full of noisy people 
and foul odors; and so I keep my door shut 
while I try to read, and so my room is like a barn. 

I could not accomplish an)rthing to-day — I 
could not read. I felt like a little child. I wanted 
nothing but to hide my head on some one's 
shoulder and sob out all my misery. 

I am nothing but a forlorn child, anyway, lost 
in this great, cruel city. 

— I am not much at pathos; but it was 
Christmas night, and I had one kind of cold in my 
head, and another kind in my feet. 


December 27th. 

I tell you that my salvation was my impa- 
tience! My salvation was that I wasted not an 
instant, that I fought — that I fought ! And each 
hour that I am forced to submit — that I am 
forced to endure and be still — that is an hour of 
ruin! It was those fearful seven weeks that be- 
gan it — and now I shall have to go back to that 
again! Oh my God, how can I bear it? What 
can I do? The pain of it heaps itself up in my 
soul — I am desperate — I will go mad! Tell me 
what to do! Tell me what to do ! 

December 28th. 

I had a strange adventure to-night, a long, 
long adventure. I was free for once in my life! 
Free and glorious — and delivered from earth! 
It happened all in a dream; I sat crouching in the 
corner, thinking. 

I had been walking down the street during 
the day and had seen a flower in a window, and 
had been made happy for a minute, thinking of 
last spring. My step had grown light, and I had 
forgotten the street around me. But then I had 
heard two little girls, sitting in a doorway, whis- 
per excitedly: " Oh, look — he's laughing! " And 



instantly all my soul had shrunk up, and my dream 
had fled, and I had hurried past and turned the 
corner. 

Is it not a strange thing? I mused — this as I 
sat by the window — that deep instinct of secrecy 
— that cowardice! Why is it that I would die 
before I would let any man see the life of my 
soul? What are these people to me? I know 
them not at all, and never shall. But I crouch 
back — I put on a mask — yes, think of it, I even 
give up the life of my soul, rather than that any 
man should see me acting differently than him- 
self! 

Somehow all at once that thought took hold 
of me with an overwhelming power — I saw the 
truth as I had never seen it before in my life. I 
saw how we live in society; and how social con- 
vention and triviality have us in such a grasp 
that it never even dawns upon us that the laws 
it dictates are not eternal and necessary! " You 
must be dignified, and calm, and commonplace," 
say social convention and triviality. 

— But I am not dignified — I am not calm! —   
I am not commonplace! 

Well, then, you must seem so. You must 


walk quietly; you must gaze around indifferently; 
you must keep a vacant face; you must try to 
look innocent of a thought. If you can't manage 
that — if you really want to think — why then you 
must flee away to the woods, where you are sure 
no one will come upon you and find you out. 
And if you can't do that — why then there's noth- 
ing for you to do but give up thinking, give up 
living, become like everybody else! 

That idea shook me all of a sudden, it made 
me quite wild — it made me dig my nails into my 
hands. It was the truth — I saw that — it was the 
truth! Here I was, a miserable, pining, starving 
wretch — and for no reason in the world but that 
I was a coward, but that I was a coward — a blind 
fool! Because I had not let the empty-headed 
and sodden, the placid and smug, the fat and 
greasy citizens of our great metropolis, tell me — 
the servant of the muses — how I ought to look, 
how I ought to act, what I ought to be! The 
very breath of my body is prayer — is effort — is 
vision; to dwell in my own light, to behold my 
own soul, to know my own truth — that is my one 
business in this world! To assert my own force 
— to be what I like — that is my duty, that is my 


hope, my one hope in all the world! And I do 
not, I can not, I dare not do it! I am sick and 
starved and dying, and I crouch in corners while 
I pray for help, and if a gleam of sunshine comes 
from a flower to me, it goes because a child sees 
me laughing! 

I sat burning with the rage of that, 'hat am 
I to do? I cried. How is it to be changed? Shall 
I live my life in spite of all men? 

And then I heard one of my devils — my 
commonplace devil — say, " But people would 
think you were crazy! " 

" What do I care what people think? " I 
burst out. 

Then came another of my devils — my face- 
tious devil — and he made me laugh. " By all 
means," said he, " let us get together a few 
eager poets, and establish a Society for the Prop- 
agation of Lunacy. Let us break down these 
conventions and confound the eyes of the fat and 
greasy citizens, and win freedom for our souls at 
any price. Let us wear strange clothes, and re- 
cite our poetry upon the streets. Let us " 

But I was not in a mood for my facetious 
devil — I flung him aside and sprang up and fled 
out to the street (this in thought, of course). 


What do I need with others? I exclaimed — with 
others to help me dare? This has to do with me! 
And it has to do with me now — with this mo- 
ment ! Am I to give up and let myself go down 
for such a phantom as this! For such a dread as 
that wooden-headed men and women will think 
me " queer " ! Am I to stay in a prison such as 
that — to be bound by a chain such as thatf I 
— I, who go about trying to persuade myself 
that this world is nothing to me — that this world 
is nothing to any one — that it is a phantom — that 
the soul is truth! When I say that the soul is 
truth, do I mean it? Do I mean it? And if I do 
mean it, will I act by it — will I act by it now — 
now, while I see it? Will I fling off this night- 
mare, will I tear my way through these wrappings 
that have choked me? Will I say, once and for 
all time, that I will be myself — that I will live my 
life — and that no man shall stop me — that no man 
shall make me afraid? Will I take the battle upon 
me and win it — win it now — fling off the last 
rag of it — put the world straight behind me — 
now — heref Spread the wings of my soul and 
take my flight into the far spaces of myself! And 
dwell there — stay there — hold to the task and 
give it not up though it kill me — now — now! 






These thoughts took hold of me — they made 
my brain reel — and I cried aloud in excitement. 
I had not been so much awake since the day I 
came out of the woods! I said the word — I said 
it — the mad word that I had not heard for six 
long months — that I had not heard since I wrote 
the last lines of my poem and came back to 
the haunts of men. And I clinched my hands, 
and stamped upon the ground, and shouted: 
" Come on! Come on! " — to the legions of my 
spirit. And it was like the taking flight of a 
great swarm of birds within me — a rushing of 
wings and a surging upward, a singing for joy 
as of a symphony. And there was singing in my 
soul, the surge of it caught me — and I waved 
my arms and went striding on, shouting still, 
" Come on! Come on! 

" Now! now! We will have it out with them 
— here — here! We will fight our fight and win 
it, and they shall not turn us back — no, by God, 
they shall not! And they may take it as they 
please — my soul is free — free once again ! Away ! 
Away! " 

And I felt the breeze of the mountains about 
me, and heard the rushing of the storm-wind and 
the trampling of the thunder. There awoke the 


old rush in my heart, the old Valkyrie music that 
flies over the forests and mountains. And I 
laughed as I sang it; I heard the war-horses 
neighing, and yelled to them — faster and faster 
— higher and higher — away from earth and all 
men! — 

And then suddenly I felt some one seize 
me by the shoulder and shake me, and heard 
a gruff voice say: "Here! Here! What's 
the matter with you? " And I stared, half- 
dazed. It was a big policeman, and around 
me I saw a sea of staring faces, wild-eyed 
children, women gazing in fright, boys jeer- 
ing; and the windows were filled with yet an- 
other crowd! 

" What's the matter with you? " demanded 
the policeman again. " Are you drunk, or 
crazy! " 

And then I realized. But the fire was still 
blazing in me, and a wild rage whirled over me. 
" Then it is by this that I am to be stopped!" I 
gasped. " By this! It is not possible after all, 
it seems; and I'm to be dragged back after all! — 
By Heaven, we'll see! " 

And so I gave the cry again — the cry of the 






Valkyrs that is madness to me! Do you not 
hear it? — and I was away again and free! 

What does a man want for his soul, if it be 
not just to strive, and to be resisted, and still 
to strive? What difference makes anything else 
— time, place or conditions? I was myself again 
— and what else did I care about? I felt the 
policeman take me by the collar and march me 
down the street; but I hardly knew that — I was 
on the mountains, and I laughed and sang. The 
very hatefulness of what was about me was my 
desperation — I would make head against such 
things or I would die in the attempt! I would 
be free! — I would live! I would live my life; and 
not the life of these people about me! I would 
fight and win, I would hold fast my heart, I 
would be true though the heavens fell! I would 
have it out, then and there, as I said — I would 
not come back to earth until I was master of 
myself. 

And so when I stood in the station-house 
and the sergeant asked me my name, I said: 
" Desire is my name, and the soul is my home! " 
And then because they shook me and worried me, 
I stretched forth my arms and cried out: " O 
God, my Father — thou who art my help and my 

life — thou soul of my soul — shall I go back for 
these things? — Shall I fear for these things? No, 
no — while I have life I will not! I will live for the 
truth, I will be crushed no longer! " 

They led me to a cell, and when I heard the 
door shut I laughed like a madman for joy. 
And then — ah, then — who can tell it? They 
came — all my angels and all my demons! AH 
my muses and all my nymphs! And the bases
