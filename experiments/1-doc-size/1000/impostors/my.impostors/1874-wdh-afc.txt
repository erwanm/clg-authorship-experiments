" Can there be any higher thing in heaven or on 
earth than love for such a woman ? " 

" Yes ; both in heaven and on earth," answered 
Ferris. 

"I do not understand you," said Don Ippolito 
with a puzzled stare. 

Ferris did not reply. He fell into a dull reverie 
in which he seemed to forget Don Ippolito and the 




 

whole affair. At last the priest spoke again: 
" Have you nothing to say to me, signore ? " 

" I ? What is there to say ? " returned the other 
blankly. 

kt Do you know any reason why I should not love 
her, save that I am have been a priest? " 

" No, I know none," said the painter, wearily. 

" Ah," exclaimed Don Ippolito, " there is some 
thing on your mind that you will not speak. I 
beseech you not to let me go wrong. I love her so 
well that I would rather die than let my love offend 
her. I am a man with the passions and hopes of a 
man, but without a man's experience, or a man's 
knowledge of what is just and right in these rela 
tions. If you can be my friend in this so far as to 
advise or warn me ; if you can be her friend " 

Ferris abruptly rose and went to his balcony, 
and looked out upon the Grand Canal. The time- 
stained palace opposite had not changed in the last 
half-hour. As on many another summer day, he saw 
the black boats going by. A heavy, high-pointed 
barge from the Sile, with the captain's family at 
dinner in the shade of a matting on the roof, moved 
sluo-crishly down the middle current. A party of 

Oo J , 

Americans in a gondola, with their opera-glasses 
and guide-books in their hands, pointed out to each 
other the eagle on the consular arms. They were 
all like sights in a mirror, or things in a world 
turned upside down. 

Ferris came back and looked dizzily at the priest, 



A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. 



trying to believe that this unlmman, sacerdotal 
phantasm had been telling him that it loved a 
beautiful young girl of his own race, faith, and 
language. 

" Will you not answer me, signore ? " meekly de 
manded Don Ippolito. 

" In this matter," replied the painter, " I cannot 
advise or warn you. The whole affair is beyond my 
conception. I mean no unkindness, but I cannot 
consult with you about it. There are reasons why 
I should not. The mother of Miss Vervain is here 
with her, and I do not feel that her interests in 
such a matter are in my hands. If they come to 
me for help, that is different. What do you wish ? 
You tell me that you are resolved to renounce the 
priesthood and go to America ; and I have answered 
you to the best of my power. You tell me that 
you are in love with Miss Vervain. What can I 
have to say about that ? " 

Don Ippolito stood listening with a patient, and 
then a wounded air. " Nothing," he answered 
proudly. " I ask your pardon for troubling you 
with my affairs. Your former kindness emboldened 
me too much. I shall not trespass again. It was 
my ignorance, which I pray you to excuse. I take; 
my leave, signore." 

He bowed, and moved out of the room, and a 
dull remorse filled the painter, as he heard the outer 
door close after him. But he could do nothing. 
He had given a wound to the heart that trusted 


him, it was in an anguish which he had not been 
able to master, and whose causes he could not yet 
define. It was all a shapeless torment ; it held him 
like the memory of some hideous nightmare pro 
longing its horror beyond sleep. It seemed impos 
sible that what had happened should have hap 
pened. 

It was long, as he sat in the chair from which he 
had talked with Don Ippolito, before he could rea 
son about what had been said ; and then the worst 
phase presented itself first. He could not help see 
ing that the priest might have found cause for hope 
in the girl's behavior toward him. Her violent re 
sentments, and her equally violent repentances ; her 
fervent interest in his unhappy fortunes, and her 
anxiety that he should at once forsake the priest 
hood ; her urging him to go to America, and her 
promising him a home under her mother's roof 
there : why might it not all be in fact a proof of 
her tenderness for him ? She might have found it 
necessary to be thus coarsely explicit with him, for 
a man in Don Ippolito's relation to her could not 
otherwise have imagined her interest in him. But 
her making use of Ferris to confirm her own pur 
poses by his words, her repeating them so that they 
should come back to him from Don Ippolito's lips, 
her letting another man go with her to look upon 
the procession in which her priestly lover was to 
appear in his sacerdotal panoply ; these things could 
not be accounted for except by that strain of inso- 



 

lent, passionate defiance which lie had noted in her 
from the beginning:. Whv should she first tell Don 



Ippolito of their going away ? " Well, I wish him 
joy of his bargain," said Ferris aloud, and rising, 
shrugged his shoulders, and tried to cast off all care 
of a matter that did not concern him. But one 
does not so easily cast off a matter that does not 
concern one. He found himself haunted by certain 
tones and looks and attitudes of the young girl, 
wholly alien to the character he had just constructed 
for her. They were child-like, trusting, uncon 
scious, far beyond anything he had yet known in 
women, and they appealed to him now with a mad 
dening pathos. She was standing there before Don 
Ippolito's picture as on that morning when she 
came to Ferris, looking anxiously at him, her inno 
cent beauty, troubled with some hidden care, hal 
lowing the place. Ferris thought of the young 
fellow who told him that he had spent three months 
in a dull German town because he had the room 
there that was once occupied by the girl who had 
refused him ; the painter remembered that the 
young fellow said he had just read of her marriage 
in an American newspaper. 

Why did Miss Vervain send Don Ippolito to him ? 
Was it some scheme of her secret love for the 
priest ; or mere coarse resentment of the cautions 
Ferris had once hinted, a piece of vulgar bravado ? 
But if she had acted throughout in pure simplicity, 
in unwise goodness of heart ? If Don Ippolito 



 

were altogether self-deceived, and nothing but her 
unknowing pity had given him grounds of hope ? 
He himself had suggested this to the priest, and 
now with a different motive he looked at it in his 
own behalf. A great load began slowly to lift it 
self from Ferris's heart, which could ache now for 
this most unhappy priest. But if his conjecture 
were just, his duty would be different. He must 
not coldly acquiesce and let things take their course. 
He had introduced Don Ippolito to the Vervains ; 
he was in some sort responsible for him ; he must 
save them if possible from the painful consequences 
of the priest's hallucination. But how to do this 
was by no means clear. He blamed himself for 
not having been franker with Don Ippolito and 
tried to make him see that the Vervains might re 
gard his passion as a presumption upon their kind 
ness to him, an abuse of their hospitable friendship ; 
and yet how could he have done this without out 
rage to a sensitive and right-meaning soul ? For a 
moment it seemed to him that he must seek Don 
Ippolito, and repair his fault ; but they had hardly 
parted as friends, and his action might be easily 
misconstrued. If he shrank from the thought of 
speaking to him of the matter again, it appeared 
yet more impossible to bring it before the Vervains. 
Like a man of the imaginative temperament as he 
was, he exaggerated the probable effect, and pic 
tured their dismay in colors that made his interfer 
ence seem a ludicrous enormity ; in fact, it would 




have been an awkward business enough for one not 
hampered by his intricate obligations. He felt 
bound to the Vervains, the ignorant young girl, and 
the addle-pated mother ; but if he ought to go to 
them and tell them what he knew, to which of them 
ought he to speak, and how? In an anguish of 
perplexity that made the sweat stand in drops upon 
his forehead, he smiled to think it just possible that 
Mrs. Vervain might take the matter seriously, and 
w sli to consider the propriety of Florida's accept 
ing Don Ippolito. But if he spoke to the daughter, 
how should he approach the subject ? " Don Ippo 
lito tells me he loves you, and he goes to America 
with the expectation that when he has made his 
fortune with a patent back-action apple-corer, you 
will marry him." Should he say something to this 
purport ? And in Heaven's name what right had 
he, Ferris, to say anything at all ? The horrible 
absurdity, the inexorable delicacy of his position 
made him laugh. 

On the other hand, besides, he was bound to Don 
Ippolito, who had come to him as the nearest friend 
of both, and confided in him. He remembered with 
a tardy, poignant intelligence how in their first talk 
of the Vervains Don Ippolito had taken pains to 
inform himself that Ferris was not in love with 
Florida. Could he be less manly and generous than 
this poor priest, and violate the sanctity of his con 
fidence? Ferris groaned aloud. No, contrive it 
as he would, call it bv what fair name he chose, he 



could not commit this treachery. It was the more 
impossible to him because, in this agony of doubt 
as to what he should do, he now at least read his 
own heart clearly, and had no longer a doubt what 
was in it. He pitied her for the pain she must 
suffer. He saw how her simple goodness, her blind 
sympathy with Don Ippolito, and only this, must 
have led the priest to the mistaken pass at which 
he stood. But Ferris felt that the whole affair had 
been fatally carried beyond his reach ; he could do 
nothing now but wait and endure. There are cases 
in which a man must not protect the woman he 
loves. This was one. 

The afternoon wore away. In the evening he 
went to the Piazza, and drank a cup of coffee at 
Florian s. Then he walked to the Public Gardens, 
where he watched the crowd till it thinned in the 
twilight and left him alone. He hung upon the 
parapet, looking off over the lagoon that at last he 
perceived to be flooded with moonlight. He des 
perately called a gondola, and bade the man row 
him to the public landing nearest the Vervains , 
and so walked up the calle, and entered the palace 
from the campo, through the court that on one side 
opened into the garden. 

Mrs. Vervain was alone in the room where he 
had always been accustomed to find her daughter 
with her, and a chill as of the impending change 
fell upon him. He felt how pleasant it had been 
to find them together ; with a vain, piercing regret 



 

he felt how much like home the place had been to 
him. Mrs. Vervain, indeed, was not changed ; she 
was even more than ever herself, though all that 
she said imported change. She seemed to observe 
nothing unwonted in him, and she began to talk in 
her way of things that she could not know were so 
near his heart. 

" Now, Mr. Ferris, I have a little surprise for 
you. Guess what it is ! " 

" I'm not good at guessing. I d rather not 
know what it is than have to guess it," saM Ferris, 
trying to be light, under his heavy trouble. 

" You won 't try once, even ? Well, you're go 
ing to be rid of us soon ! We are going away." 

" Yes, I knew that," said Ferris quietly. " Don 
Ippolito told me so to-day." 

" And is that all you have to say ? Is n t it 
rather sad ? Is n t it sudden ? Come, Mr. Ferris, 
do be a little complimentary, for once ! " 

" It's sudden, and I can assure you it's sad 
enough for me," replied the painter, in a tone 
which could not leave any doubt of his sincerity. 

"Well, so it is for us," quavered Mrs. Vervain. 
" You have been very, very good to us," she went 
on more collectedly, u and we shall never forget it. 
Florida has been speaking of it, too, and she's ex 
tremely grateful, and thinks we've quite imposed 
upon you." 

" Thanks." 

" I suppose we have, but as I always say, you're 



 

the representative of the country here. However, 
that's neither here nor there. We have no rela 
tives on the face of the earth, you know ; but I 
have a good many old friends in Providence, and 
we re going back there. We both think I shall 
be better at home ; for I in sorry to say, Mr. 
Ferris, that though I don 't complain of Venice,, 
it's really a beautiful place, and all that ; not the 
least exaggerated, still I don 't think it's done 
my health much good ; or at least I don 't seem to 
gain, don 't you know, I don 't seem to gain." 

" I'm very sorry to hear it, Mrs. Vervain." 

" Yes, I'm sure you are ; but you see, don 't you, 
that we must go ? We are going next week. 
When we've once made up our minds, there "s no 
object in prolonging the agony." 

Mrs. Vervain adjusted her glasses witli the 
thumb and finger of her right hand, and peered in 
to Ferris's face with a gay smile. " But the great 
est part of the surprise is," she resumed, lowering 
her voice a little, " that Don Ippolito is going with 
us." 

" Ah ! " cried Ferris sharply. 

" I kneiv I should surprise you," laughed Mrs. 
Vervain. " We've been having a regular confab 
clave, I mean about it here, and he's all on 
fire to go to America ; though it must be kept a 
great secret on his account, poor fellow. He's to 
join us in France, and then he can easily get into 
England, with us* You know he's to give up being 




a priest, and is going to devote himself to invention 
when he gets to America. Now, what do yon 
think of it, Mr. Ferris ? Quite strikes yon dumb, 
doesn 't it ? " triumphed Mrs. Vervain. " I sup 
pose it's what yon would call a wild goose chase, 
I used to pick up all those phrases, but we 
shall carry it through." 

Ferris gasped, as though about to speak, but said, 
nothing. 

"Don Ippolito's been here the whole afternoon," 
continued Mrs. Vervain, " or rather ever since 
about five o clock. He took dinner with us, and 
we've been talking it over and over. Fie's so en 
thusiastic about it, and yet he breaks, down every 
little while, and seems quite to despair of the un 
dertaking. But Florida won 't let him do that ; and 
really it's funny, the way he defers to her judg 
ment you know I always regard Florida as such 
a mere child and seems to take every word she 
says for gospel. But, shedding tears, now : it's 
dreadful in a man, isn 't  it ? I wish Don Ippolito 
wouldn 't do that. It makes one creep. I can 't 
feel that it's manly ; can you ? " 

Ferris found voice to say something about those 
things being different with the Latin races. 

" Well, at any rate," said Mrs. Vervain, u I'm 
glad that Americans don 't shed tears, as a general 
rule. Now, Florida : you d think she was the 
man all through this business, she's so perfectly he 
roic about it ; that is, outwardly : for I can see 



 

women can, in each other, Mr. Ferris just where 
she's on the point of breaking down, all the while. 
Has she ever spoken to you about Don Ippolito ? 
She does think so highly of your opinion, Mr. Fer 
ris." 

" She does me too much honor," said Ferris, with 
ghastly irony. 

" Oh, I don 't think so," returned Mrs. Vervain. 
" She told me this morning that she *d made Don 
Ippolito promise to speak to you about it ; but he 
didn t mention having done so, and I hated, 

don 't you know, to ask him In fact, Florida 

had told me beforehand that I mustn t. She said 
he must be left entirely to himself in that matter, 
and " Mrs. Vervain looked suggestively at Fer 
ris. 

" He spoke to me about it," said Ferris. 

" Then why in the world did you let me run on ? 
I suppose you advised him against it." 

" I certainly did." 

"Well, there's where I think woman's intuition 
is better than man's reason." 

The painter silently bowed his head. 

"Yes, I'm quite woman's rights in that respect," 
said Mrs. Vervain. 

" Oh, without doubt," answered Ferris, aimlessly. 

" I'm perfectly delighted," she went on, " at the. 
idea of Don Ippolito's giving up the priesthood, and 
I've told him he must get married to some good 
American girl. You ought to have seen ho\v the 



 

poor fellow blushed ! But really, you know, there 
are lots of nice girls that would jump at him so 
handsome and sad-looking, and a genius." 

Ferris could only stare helplessly at Mrs. Ver 
vain, who continued : 

" Yes, /think he's a genius, and I ra determined 
that he shall have a chance. I suppose we've got 
a job on our hands ; but I in not sorry. I'll in 
troduce him into society, and if he needs money he 
shall have it. What does God give us money for, 
Mr. Ferris, but to help our fellow-creatures ? " 

So miserable, as he was, from head to foot, that 
it seemed impossible he could endnre more, Ferris 
could not forbear laughing at this burst of piety. 

" What are you laughing at? " asked Mrs. Ver 
vain, who had cheerfully joined him. " Something 
I've been saying. Well, you won 't have me to 
laugh at much longer. I do wonder whom you ll 
have next." 

Ferris's merriment died away in something like a 
groan, and when Mrs. Vervain again spoke, it was 
in a tone of sudden querulousness. " I wish Florida 
would come ! She went to bolt the land-gate after 
Don Ippolito, I wanted her to, but she ought 
to have been back long ago. It's odd you didn 't 
meet them, coming in. She must be in the garden 
somewhere ; I suppose she's sorry to be leaving it. 
But I need her. Would you be so very kind, Mr. 
Ferris, as to go and ask her to come to me ? " 

Ferris rose heavily from the chair in which IK- 



 

seemed to have grown ten years older. He had 
hardly heard anything that he did not know al 
ready, but the clear vision of the affair with which 
he had come to the Vervains was hopelessly con 
fused and darkened. He could make nothing of 
any phase of it. He did not know whether he 
cared now to see Florida or not. He mechanically 
obeyed Mrs. Vervain, and stepping out upon the 
terrace, slowly descended the stairway. 

The moon was shining brightly into the garden. 



XV. 

FLORIDA and Don Ippolito had paused in the 
pathway which parted at the fountain and led in 
one direction to the water-gate, and in the other out 
through the palace-court into the campo. 

" Now, you must not give way to despair again," 
she said to him. " You will succeed, I am sure, 
for you will deserve success." 

" It is all your goodness, madamigella," sighed 
the priest, " and at the bottom of my heart I am 
afraid that all the hope and courage I have are also 
yours." 

" You shall never want for hope and courage 
then. We believe in you, and we honor your pur 
pose, and we will be your steadfast friends. But 
now you must think only of the present of how 
you are to get away from Venice. Oh, I can un 
derstand how you must hate to leave it ! What a 
beautiful night ! You must n t expect such moon 
light as this in America, Don Ippolito." 

"It is beautiful, is it not?" said the priest, 
kindling from her. " But I think we Venetians are 
never so conscious of the beauty of Venice as you 



strangers are. 



" I don 't know. I only know that now, since we 
have made up our minds to go, and fix?d the day and 



 

hour, it is more like leaving my own country than 
anything else I Ve ever felt. This garden, I seem 
to have spent my whole life in it ; and when we 
are settled in Providence, I'm going to have mother 
send back for some of these statnes. I suppose 
Signer Cavaletti would n t mind our robbing his 
place of them if he were paid enough. At any rate 
we must have this one that belongs to the fountain. 
You shall be the first to set the fountain playing 
over there, Don Ippolito, and then we'll sit down 
on this stone bench before it, and imagine ourselves 
in the garden of Casa Vervain at Venice." 

" No, no : let me be the last to set it playing 



here," said the priest, quickly stooping to the pipe 
at the foot of the figure, " and then we will sit 
down here, and imagine ourselves in the garden of 
Casa Vervain at Providence." 

Florida put her hand on his shoulder. " You 
must n t do it," she said simply. " The padrone 
doesn 't like to waste the water." 

"Oh, we'll pray the saints to rain it back on him 
some day," cried Don Ippolito with willful levity, 
and the stream leaped into the moonlight and 
seemed to hang there like a tangled skein of silver. 

" But how shall I shut it off when you are 
gone ? " asked the young girl, looking ruefully at 
the floating threads of splendor. 

" Oh, I will shut it off before I go," answered 
Don Ippolito. " Let it play a moment," he con 
tinued, gazing rapturously upon it. while the moon 



 

painted his lifted face with a pallor that his black 
robes heightened. He fetched a long, sighing 
breath, as if he inhaled with that respiration all 
the rich odors of the flowers, blanched like his own 
visage in the white lustre ; as if he absorbed into 
his heart at once the wide glory of the summer 
night, and the beauty of the young girl at his side. 
It seemed a supreme moment with him ; he looked 
as a man might look who has climbed out of life 
long defeat into a single instant of release and tri 
umph. 

Florida sank upon the bench before the fountain, 
indulging his caprice with that sacred, motherly 
tolerance, some touch of which is in all womanly 
yielding to men's will, and which was perhaps 
present in greater degree in her feeling towards a 
man more than ordinarily orphaned and unfriended. 

" Is Providence your native city ? " asked Don 
Ippolito, abruptly, after a little silence. 

" Oli no ; I was born at St. Augustine in Flor 
ida." 

" Ah yes, I forgot ; madama has told me about 
it; Providence is her city. But the two are near 
together ? " 

" No," said Florida, compassionately, " they are 
a thousand miles apart." 

" A thousand miles ? What a vast country ! " 

" Yes, it's a whole world." 

" Ah, a world, indeed ! " cried the priest, softly. 
" I shall never comprehend it." 


 

" You never will," answered tlie young girl 
gravely, " if you do not think about it more practi 
cally." 

" Practically, practically ! " lightly retorted the 
priest. u What a word with you Americans ! 
That is the consul's word : practical." 

"Then you have been to see him to-day ? " 
asked Florida, witli eagerness. " I wanted to ask 
you"- 

kt Yes. I went to consult the oracle, as you bade 
me." 

" Don Ippolito " 

" And he was averse to my going to America. 
He said it was not practical." 

" Oh ! " murmured the girl. 

" I think," continued the priest with vehemence, 
"that Signor Ferris is no longer my friend.* 

" Did he treat you coldly harshly ? " she asked, 
with a note of indignation in her voice. " Did he 
know that I that you came " 

" Perhaps he was right. Perhaps I shall indeed 
go to ruin there. Ruin, ruin ! Do "I not live ruin 
here ? " 

" What did he say what did Ira tell you ? " 

"No, no; not now, madamigella ! I do not 
want to think of that man, now. I want you to 
help me once more to realize myself in America, 
where I shall never have been a priest, where I 
sluill at least battle even-handed with the world. 
Come, let us forget him ; the thought of him p.d- 



 

sies all my hop: . He could not see me save in this 
robe, in this figure that I abhor." 

" Oh, it was strange, it was not like him, it was 
cruel ! What did he's ay ? " 

" In everything but words, he bade me despair ; 
he bade me look upon all that makes life dear and 
noble as impossible to me ! " 

" Oh, how ? Perhaps he did not understand 
you. No, he did not understand you. What did 
you say to him, Don Ippolito ? Tell me ! " She 
leaned towards him, in anxious emotion, as she 
spoke. 

The priest rose, and stretched out his arms, as if 
he would gather something of courage from the in 
finite space. - In his visage were the sublimity and 
the terror of a man who puts everything to the risk. 

" How will it really be with me, yonder ? " he 
demanded. " As it is with other men, whom their 
past life, if it has been guiltless, does not follow to 
that new world of freedom and justice ? " 

"Why should it not be so ? " demanded Florida. 
" Did he say it would not ? " 

"Need it be known there that I have been a 
priest ? Or if I tell it, will it make me appear a 
kind of monster, different from other men ? " 

"No, no ! " she answered fervently. u Your 
story would gain friends and honor for you every 
where in America. Did lie " 

" A moment, a moment ! " cried Don Ippolito, 
catching his breath. " Will it ever be possible for 



 

me to win something more than honor and friend 
ship tli ere ? " 

She looked up at him askingly, confusedly. 

kt If I am a man, and the time should ever come 
that a face, a look, a voice, shall be to me what they 
are to other men, will she remember it against me 
that I have been a priest, when I tell her say to 
her, madamigella how dear she is to me, offer her 
my life's devotion, ask her to be my wife ?".... 

Florida rose from the seat, and stood confronting 
him, in a helpless silence, which he seemed not to 
notice. 

Suddenly he clasped his hands together, and des 
perately stretched them towards her. 

" Oh, my hope, my trust, my life, if it were you 
that I loved ?".... 

" What ! " shuddered the girl, recoiling, with al 
most a shriek. " You ? A priest ! " 

Don Ippolito gave a low cry, half sob : 

" His words, his words ! It is true, I cannot 
escape, I am doomed, I must die as I have lived ! " 

He dropped his face into his hands, and stood 
with his head bowed before her ; neither spoke for 
a long time, or moved. 

Then Florida said absently, in the husky mur 
mur to which her voice fell when she was strongly 
moved, " Yes, I see it all, how it has been," and 
was silent again, staring, as if a procession of the 
events and scenes of the past months were passing 
before her ; and presently she moaned to herself, 
fcC Oh, oh, oh ! " and wrung her hands. 



 

The foolish fountain kept capering and babbling 
on. All at once, now, as a flame flashes up and 
then expires, it leaped and dropped extinct at the 
foot of the statue. 

Its going out seemed somehow to leave them in 
darkness, and under cover of that gloom she drew 
nearer the priest, and by such approaches as one 
makes toward a fancied apparition, when his fear 
will not let him fly, but it seems better to suffer the 
worst from it at once than to live in terror of it ever 
after, she lifted her hands to his, and gently taking 
them away from his face, looked into his hopeless 
eyes. 

" Oh, Don Ippolito," she grieved. " What shall 
I say to you, what can I do for yon, now ? " 

But there was nothing to do. The whole edifice 
of his dreams, his wild imaginations, had fallen into 
dust at a word ; no magic could rebuild it ; the end 
that never seems the end had come. He let her 
keep his cold hands, and presently he returned the 
entreaty of her tears with his wan, patient smile. 

" You cannot help me ; there is no help for an 
error like mine. Sometime, if ever the thought of 
me is a greater pain than it is at this moment, you 
can forgive me. Yes, you can do that for me." 

" But who, who will ever forgive me," she cried, 
"for my blindness ! Oh, you must believe that I 
never thought, I never dreamt " 

" I know it well. It was your fatal truth that 
did it ; truth too high and fino for me to have dis 
cerned save through such agony as .... You too 



 

loved my soul, like the rest, and you would have 
had me no priest for the reason that they would 
have had me a priest I see it. But you had no 
right to love my soul and not me you, a woman. 
A woman must not love only the soul of a man." 

" Yes, yes I " piteously explained the girl, " but 
you were a priest to me ! " 

"That is true, madamigella. I was always a 
priest to you ; and now I see that I never could be 
otherwise. Ah, the wrong began many years be 
fore we met. I was trying to blame you a lit 
tle " - 

" Blame me, blame me ; do ! " 

" but there is no blame. Think that it was 
another way of asking your forgiveness. . . . O my 
God, my God, my God ! " 

He released his hands from her, and uttered this 
cry under his breath, with his face lifted towards 
the heavens. When he looked at her again, he 
said : " Madamigella, if my share of this misery 
gives me the right to ask of you " 

" Oh ask anything of me ! I will give every 
thing, do everything I " 

He faltered, and then, " You do not love me," he 
said abruptly ; " is there some one else that you 
love ? " 

She did not answer. 

"Is it . . . he?" 

She hid her face. 

"I knew it," groaned the priest, kt I knew that, 
too ! " and he turned awav. 



 

" Don Ippolito, Don Ippolito oh, poor, poor 
Don Ippolito ! " cried the girl, springing towards 
him. " Is this the way you leave me ? Where 
are you going ? What will you do now ? " 

"Did I not say? I am going to die a priest." 

" Is there nothing that you will let me be to you, 
hope for you ? " 

" Nothing," said Don Ippolito, after a moment. 
" What could you? " He seized the hands implor 
ingly extended towards him, and clasped them to 
gether and kissed them both. " Adieu ! " he whis 
pered ; then he opened them, and passionately 
kissed either palm ; " adieu, adieu ! " 

A great wave of sorrow and compassion and de 
spair for him swept through her. She flung her 
arms about his neck, and pulled his head down upon 
her heart, and held it tight there, weeping and 
moaning over him as over some hapless, harmless 
thing that she had unpurposely bruised or killed. 
Then she suddenly put her hand against his breast, 
and thrust him away, and turned and ran. 

Ferris stepped back again into the shadow of the 
tree from which he had just emerged, and clung to 
its trunk lest he should fall. Another seemed to 
creep out of the court in his person, and totter 
across the white glare of the campo and down the 
blackness of the calle. In the intersected spaces 
where the moonlight fell, this alien, miserable man 
saw the figure of a priest gliding on before him. 



XVI. 

FLORIDA swiftly mounted the terrace steps, but 
she stopped with her hand on the door, panting, and 
turned and walked slowly away to the end of the 
terrace, drying her eyes with dashes of her hand 
kerchief, and ordering her hair, some coils of which 
had been loosened by her flight. Then she went 
back to the door, waited, and softly opened it. 
Her mother was not in the parlor where she had 
left her, and she passed noiselessly into her own 
room, where some trunks stood open and half- 
packed against the wall. She began to gather up 
the pieces of dress that lay upon the bed and chairs, 
and to fold them with mechanical carefulness and 
put them in the boxes. Her mother's voice called 
from the other chamber, u Is that you, Florida ? " 

" Yes, mother," answered the girl, but remained 
kneeling before one of the boxes, with that pale 
green robe in her hand which she had worn on the 
morning when Ferris had first brought Don Ippo- 
lito to see them. She smoothed its folds and looked 
down at it without making any motion to pack it 
away, and so she lingered while her mother ad 
vanced with one question after another ; " What are 
you doing, Florida ? Where are you ? Why didn 't 
you come to me ? " and finally stood in the door- 




way. " Oh, you're packing. Do you know, Flor 
ida, I'm getting very impatient about going. I 
wish we could be off at once." 

A tremor passed over the young girl and she 
started from her languid posture, and laid the dress 
in the trunk. " So do I, mother. I would give the 
world if we could go to-morrow ! " 

" Yes, but we can 't, you see. I'm afraid we Ve 
undertaken a great deal, my dear. It's quite a 
weight upon my mind, already ; and I don 't know 
what it will be. If we were free, now, I should 
say, go to-morrow, by all means. But we could n t 
arrange it with Don Ippolito on our hands." 

Florida waited a moment before she replied. 
Then she said coldly, " Don Ippolito is not going 
with us, mother." 

" Not going with us ? Why " 

" He is not going to America. He will not leave 
Venice ; he is to remain a priest," said Florida, dog 
gedly. 

Mrs. Vervain sat down in the chair that stood 
beside the door. " Not going to America ; not 
leave Venice; remain a priest? Florida, you as 
tonish me ! But I am not the least surprised, not 
the least in the world. I thought Don Ippolito 
would give out, all along. He is not what I should 
call fickle, exactly, but he is weak, or timid, rather. 
He is a good man, but he lacks courage, resolution. 
I always doubted if he would succeed in America ; 
he is too much of a dreamer. But this, really, goes 



 

a little beyond anything. I never expected this. 
What did he say, Florida? How did he excuse 
himself ? " 

" I hardly know ; very little. What was there 
to say ? " 

" To be sure, to be sure. Did you try to reason 
with him, Florida?" 

" No," answered the girl, drearily. 

" I am glad of that. I think you had said quite 
enough already. You owed it to yourself not to do 
so, and he might have misinterpreted it. These 
foreigners are very different from Americans. No 
doubt we should have had a time of it, if he had 
gone with us. It must be for the best. I'm sure 
it was ordered so. But all that doesn 't relieve 
Don Ippolito from the charge of black ingratitude, 
and want of consideration for us. He's quite made 
fools of us." 

"He was not to blame. It was a very great step 
for him. And if " .... 

" I know that. But he ought not to have talked 
of it. He ought to have known his own mind fully 
before speaking ; that's the only safe way. Well, 
then, there is nothing to prevent our going to-mor 
row." 

Florida drew a long breath, and rose to go on 
with the work of packing.
