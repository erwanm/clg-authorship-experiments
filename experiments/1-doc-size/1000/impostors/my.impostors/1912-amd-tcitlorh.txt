Firth went through the wide hall. Dr. Richards 
was not in, but the surgeon came to take a look 
at his patient so fair and rosy and straight now. 
And here were the matron and the nurses and the 
sun parlor and the little ones, some who would 
never be any better, and some who would be dis- 
charged in a few weeks, and dear Nurse Jane who 
took both his hands in hers and kissed him. 

Why, you have grown,” she exclaimed, and 
how well you look! I’m glad to see you again, 
for we really did miss you. I suppose you had 
your legacy all right. Mr. Collamore came here, 
and he was quite touched with your attention to 
Arthur and the will which pleased the poor dying 
boy so much.” 

“ Oh, the books were beautiful,” returned Chan, 
“ and he sent me Arthur’s pretty gold watch, and 
wrote such a sweet letter that mother and Rilla 
and I cried over it.” 

I liked him better than I supposed I should, 
and Arthur was much better oif here than left at 
home. Wasn’t your mother surprised and 
happy? ” 

“ She just was. They were all so glad. I’m 
going to school now, and it’s a good long walk, 
but I don’t get a bit tired. You were all so kind 
to me.” 


 

“ And you were such a lovely patient.’’ 

He glanced up with smiling eyes. 

Here was the little bed where he had lain in 
the plaster cast and been fed like a baby. There 
wa? a bigger boy in it whose head was held in a 
sort of a frame and whose face wore a most dis- 
tressed expression, not even lighting up at the 
nurse’s tender tones. And just over there little 
Arthur had taken his journey from pain and hope- 
lessness to the better country, where the glorified 
body would be straight and perfect. It all seemed 
like a pathetic dream, but he was glad he had 
come, and had seen dear Nurse Jane. 

Then to the train and home again. 

“ It’s been a splendid day, only it doesn’t seem 
as if you ought to have bought me so much, and 

all the pleasure and the luncheon ” 

Well, you are my little boy. The first little 
boy I ever owned, at least, I own as much as half 
of you,” laughingly. And you can tell them 
about the hospital and the Christmas sights in the 
stores and how your room looks, but the other will 
be our Christmas secret.” 

“ And doesn’t mother know ” 

Mr. Mann flushed. '' Yes. You know I had 
to ask her first. But we don’t want the children 
to get it whispered about. Why, it’s only five 


 

days now,” and a happy light went over his face 
as if the pleasure to him was going to be great 
indeed. Chan felt as if there was something he 
did not quite understand, but he was going to keep 
his part of the secret loyally. 

So they said good-by. Dan would take the little 
boy over home. 

The neighbors wondered at the many boxes and 
packages they watched going into the Mann house. 

Mrs. Greer, who lived on the lower side, ran in 
to Mrs. Chedister’s. 

“ What do you suppose is going on? ” she asked 
in a sort of fever heat. Can it be that Mr. 
Mann is planning to be married, yet it does seem 
like it. I wonder if it is to his housekeeper. 
She’s a very nice-appearing person, but it would 
make it quite awkward. Of course we are not 
expected to be on calling terms with house- 
keepers.” 

It is embarrassing when a man does that, and 
I think it a very ill-judged step. The woman 
hasn’t any real social position. It seems to me 
Mr. Mann might look higher. He has a nice 
business standing and is a man of means, and the 
men like him, and he doesn’t seem afraid of spend- 
ing his money.” 

That’s a beautiful team of his'” 


 

“ Yes. Now if we kept a man I’d put him 
up to finding out something by that Dan. But 
I suppose we’ll learn by and by. Only one 
wouldn’t know just how to receive the new Mrs. 
Mann.” 

So they gossiped up and down the avenue. 

Over at the little red house they talked about 
Christmas. It seemed to Marigold that her 
mother acted quite indifferent. They had very 
little money, to be sure, for she had not been 
doing much. She went over to Mrs. Townsend’s 
on Monday and helped make mince pies and put 
up curtains, and do various odds and ends as they 
were going to have a Christmas eve party for the 
young folks. Marigold made over Laurel’s rag 
doll, put in blue eyes and black eyebrows, and 
begged a little red ink for the lips. She and Rilla 
had been knitting the twins new hoods. Prim 
made a picture-book, cutting flowers out of old 
garden calendars her father had laid away, and 
pasting them into an old blank-book. 

“ Oh dear, if we could only have a real rich 
Christmas for once,” and she sighed. Mother, 
aren’t you going to make anything?” 

I’m going to the store to-morrow to get a 
few things. Oh, yes. I’ll make some crullers ” 

“ And gingerbread men ! It wouldn’t be Christ- 


 

mas without them. We’ll hang up our stockings 
anyhow. And maybe ” 

She didn’t hardly dare let the maybe ” fly. 
If she had she would have said, “ Maybe Mr. 
Mann will bring us something,” but she thought 
her mother acted rather queer when his name was 
mentioned. 

Amaryllis was making various little things. 
New white aprons for the twins out of some old 
white dimity she had found in the rummage heap. 
If she could have spent a little money. Well, they 
would go to the Sunday-school room on Christmas 
afternoon and get a cornucopia of candy, an 
orange, and a book. That would be something. 

Chan was very quiet, too, somehow. But then 
the children were in school all day and stopped 
coming home to have a little fun. So there was 
only the evening. School was dismissed Tuesday 
afternoon, and they could have all day Wednesday. 

If Dan would come and take us out in the 
big sleigh wouldn’t it be splendid ! ” cried Primrose, 
and they all gave a long, deep sigh. 

Mother came home with quite a big parcel, 
and of course no one would peep into it. Then 
she made crullers and a hot johnny-cake for sup- 
per, and before they were through Linn came in 
whistling. 


 

‘‘ Why, Linn, what sent you home? To-morrow 
isn’t Christmas ! ” said Rilla. 

It’s first cousin to it, though.” Then he looked 
at his mother and laughed. She flushed up, and 
then rose and went to the stove as something there 
needed her. 

And I have a Santa Claus dollar,” went on 
Linn. “ I think it is a real Santa Claus when it 
is something you don’t expect. And it was funny, 
but Mr. Beers always says on Saturday, ' Now 
you’ll be down bright and early Monday morning,’ 
and he never said a word about Friday. But he 
did say, ' Linn, you’ve been a good, faithful boy 
and I wish you the best Christmas you ever had.’ 
Mother, you don’t think he means to let me go, do 
you? I’ve been doing my very best. You had a 
long talk with him,” and the boy’s bright face was 
very anxious. 

‘‘ No, Linn, dear. He said to me you gave good 
satisfaction and he should be very sorry to have 
you go.” 

“ Then I’m not going. You may bet your bot- 
tom dollar on that.” 

Come and have some supper.” 

They stuffed me down there. A chunk of 
raisin cake, lickin’ good, too, two doughnuts, and 
a great piece of mince pie. Next Christmas I 




mean to be rich enough to have mince pies — and 
a turkey.” 

May I be there, here, or wherever it is to 
share them,” appended Marigold. 

It was enough like other nights, except Linn’s 
being home, yet there seemed something different 
in the atmosphere. The twins were put to bed, 
Lai begging that her stocking should be hung up. 
Tip got his arms around Chandler and insisted 
upon hearing over again the wonderful things that 
were in the New York stores. Great stuffed ani- 
mals, cats that could mew, dogs that could bark, 
sheep that could ba-a, splendid drums and curious 
toys and such piles of candies. Linn dropped 
down on the old lounge and went fast asleep. 

Mrs. Firth lighted a lamp, put a shawl around 
her, and went upstairs. There were some things 
she wanted to look over. She opened the old 
chest that had been grandmother’s. Her wedding 
dress of youth, a plain, simple muslin, was in it. 
She had meant next summer to make it over for 
Rilla. There was a hand-wrought lace shawl that 
her own mother had worked, and some pieces of 
finery she had never needed for herself. Papers, 
various things she had tucked away, and a pair 
of silk stockings, cream color now. She would 
wear them on Christmas day. Then she dropped 


 

down in a little huddle and cried. Was it true 
some one was going to take her and the eight 
children, and that she was to have no more anxiety, 
no more struggles with poverty, and be happy, be 
loved! It did not seem true. Wouldn’t some- 
thing happen! One always asks it on the eve of 
a great joy. She had been loved before, but not 
in this fashion. Mr. Firth had been twelve years 
older, and though she and Mr. Mann had come to 
middle life, it seemed like a new youth to her. 

She packed a few things into a basket, and 
then came downstairs. Oh, how good the warmth 
felt ! She held her hands over the cheering stove. 

Momsey, you look blue and cold, and as if 
you had been crying. What made you stay so 
long up in that cold garret ? ” asked Marigold. 

Why, you sleep up there all night.” Her heart 
leaped at the thought of the comfort they were 
going to have. 

Well, that’s different. We have the good 
warm brick, and we just cuddle down in the 
blankets and go to sleep before you can say ‘ Jack 
Robinson.’ ” 

“ Why do you have to say ‘ Jack Robinson ’ ? ” 
inquired Tip sleepily. 

Well — I don’t know, unless he carries about 
a bag of sleepy powder. Tip, do go to bed.” 




Chan convoyed him into the bedroom, and soon 
had him tucked in. Then he came back and placed 
one small arm about his mother’s waist, and whis- 
pered, I know. He told me we were to go over 
for Christmas.” 

She colored as she bent and kissed him. There 
was no need of keeping part of the secret any 
longer. The other he must tell himself. 

“Children,” — there were only five now, the 
others were in bed — “ children, we are all go- 
ing over to Grafton to-morrow to spend our 
Christmas ” 

“ Oh, mother ! ” and Marigold sprang up and 
gave her a tremendous hug that nearly pushed her 
over. “ Is that what’s made you so sort of queer 
and as if you didn’t take much interest in fixing 
anything? We have been talking about it, and 
somehow it seemed as if it would be a rather 
doleful Christmas. Oh, I’m so glad! I could 
hop around on one foot.” 

With that she caught Prim, and they pirouetted 
round the room as if they were born ballet dancers. 

It’s so delightful,” said Amaryllis sedately. 

Mother, doesn’t Mr. Mann think of the nicest 
things? ” 

“ That’s why I have a holiday to-morrow, I 
s’pose.” Linn had been wondering all the time. 


 

‘‘ And Mr. Beers was so pleasant about it I thought 
he couldn’t mean to discharge me. Hurray ! It’ll 
beat Thanksgiving I bet a cow ! ” 

“ And if you lose you haven’t any cow to pay 
with,” appended Chan. 

Children, you must all go to bed now. It’s 
getting late. Yes, it was — it was splendid,” she 
could think of no other word without betraying 
herself, “ splendid in him to ask us to share his 
Christmas when we had so little of our own. And 
I hope you will all be grateful and try your best, 
for it seems as if Heaven had sent us its choicest 
blessing.” 

Then she kissed them and hurried them off lest 
she should give way to the emotions that surged 
within her. 


CHAPTER XVIII 


A WEDDING AND CHRISTMAS 

It was a glorious winter morning. The sun 
came up out of a sea of iridescent light and pres- 
ently settled to a flawless blue. There was still 
sleighing, it took only a little snow to renew it in 
country places. The older children did up the 
chores. Linn brought in two armfuls of wood 
and piled it up behind the stove so that it would 
get thoroughly dry. Then he fed the chickens and 
said laughingly — 

“ Why, it seems like old times. But how will 
they manage these two days ? ” 

“ Oh, some one will have to come over and see 
to them.” 

Will we come home to-morrow night, think? ” 

Why ” His mother made a sudden 

errand into the bedroom to hide her embarrass- 
ment. 

Circumstances had favored secrecy and saved 
Mrs. Firth from curious questioning. The road 
from Grafton ran straight along until it met the 

 

old north road. That was all big farms, though 
it led down to the village. This little sort of back 
lane took in the rear of them. With the exception 
of the little old red house there was no other for 
about half a mile and that was Squire Briggs’s. 
After that the real village began, mostly on the 
other side, where cottages were closer together. 
Then the matter had been so sudden and strange 
to her. She had felt that she ought to confide 
in Mrs. Burnham, but Mr. Mann had said, Leave 
that to me. I’ll settle it all right.” He was not 
going to have her criticised or commented upon. 
The children put on their best clothes. 

“ Mother, I don’t know what we would have 
done this winter without old Aunt Kitty’s bundle,” 
said thoughtful Amaryllis. “ And it’s funny but 
we didn’t like it much at first. You can do a 
great many things when you take time to consider. 
If necessity is the mother of invention, I think 
poverty must be the father.” 

Yes,” with a smiling nod. 

“ There’s the sleigh — oh, only the little sleigh ! ” 
Mr. Mann sprang out and blanketed Bonnie, 
then marched into the house with a merry general 
greeting, and walked straight over to Mrs. Firth, 
taking her in his arms and kissing her dozens of 
times while the children stood in astonishment. 


 

Then he turned her around facing them, but she 
did not look up. 

He was so bright and fresh, clean-shaven, and 
immaculate in attire, and his face fairly shone 
with joyous satisfaction, the dimple deeper than 
ever. 

“ Children,” and his voice seemed richer and 
tenderer, I have asked your mother to marry 
me, and she has consented. I wanted Chan at 
first and bargained for him, then on Thanksgiving 
I found I wanted you all and your mother in the 
bargain. So you are all to come over, and this 
afternoon your mother is going to give me herself 
and all of you children until you are grown men 
and women. I am to be your father, and my 
home is to be yours. We are to love each other, 
to share whatever comes, to make each other as 
happy as we can for her dear sake.” 

There was a curious silence. It was not possi- 
ble to take it in at a moment. But Amaryllis, who 
was standing nearest, suddenly put out both hands 
and clasped his one free arm. 

Oh,” she cried, I think you are the best and 
sweetest and dearest man, better than any one in 
a story book because you are real. And there’s 
so many of us ” 

The spell was broken. They swarmed around 


 

him like bees and he was kissing brows and rosy 
cheeks and sweet lips. 

Oh, was this what you meant ? ” said Chan 
in a breathless sort of voice. 

We've wished we had a father just like you,’’ 
began Primrose with winning frankness. When 
we read the Sunday-school books, and there’s some 
one nice in them, we say, ‘ Oh, that’s like Mr. 
Mann, isn’t it?’ There isn’t many of the fathers 
that we like all the way through, but we plan 
about it and imagine, and have a nicer house than 
this, but we never thought of anything quite like 
yours, and oh. I’m so glad I can’t hardly hold in. 
I want to run and shout.” 

Maybe you won’t like me all the way through.” 
There was such a funny expression in his face, 
as if he were trying to look severe and couldn’t, 
and a quiver of mirth all around his mouth. 

Oh, you’ll have to laugh,” cried Marigold. 
''No one ever could be much cross with a dimple 
like that in his cheek. We’re not always good, 
but we’ll try. And you’re sure you’re in dead 
earnest and not funning in any way? But there’s 
such a lot of us to have ! ” 

" And a big house to put you in. No, my 
child, we are to have and to hold as long as 
God spares us and to make each other happy. I 


 

shall want a good deal of love, and I have ever 
so much to give you ” 

How do people get married?” inquired Tip. 
'' What does the minister say? ” 

‘‘ You’ll see in good time — about the middle of 
the afternoon.” 

“ And don’t we come back to this old house 
any more? What are the chickens going to do, 
and the cat ? ” 

Well — they’ll have to come over too.” 

Tip’s face was full of questioning mystery. 
Neither could Rhoda understand, but Lai con- 
tentedly hugged her doll and told her they were 
going to the man’s house and have dinner. 

Linn had come around to his mother’s side and 
pulled her head down to whisper. 

I’m so glad, mother dear. And now you 
won’t have to work so hard, and it’ll be so lovely 
over there, and you won’t have to give up Chan. 
Seems somehow strange and beautiful, like a little 
bit out of heaven. Don’t you think God sent us 
Mr. Mann because he knew how hard it was for 
you, and then just at Christmas times, too, when 
the whole world gets glad?” 

Yes, dear,” and they both kissed amid tears of 
joy and gratitude. 

Now, children,” as Dan drove up with the 


 

big sleigh, “ you’re all going to be packed in like 
sardines, and I am to bring your mother,” and he 
unclasped the little arms that were round his legs 
and body. Get your wraps and hoods.” 

Mrs. Firth helped bundle them up. 

“ Oh, mother, you’ll surely come ! ” cried Prim- 
rose. 

‘‘ Prim, if you doubt my word again Pll shut 
you up in a dark closet and you shall not have any 
dinner,” declared her prospective father, and saucy 
Prim laughed and put a kiss in the dimple. 

Mrs. Firth looked at her lover. Oh,” and her 
voice quivered, “ I wonder if you will ever be 
sorry that you took us all. Sometimes children 
do not turn out well.” 

Then you will have me to share the sorrow 
and trouble. And I do believe a man’s authority 
strengthens and tides over dangerous places. But 
we won’t borrow trouble. We will have a few 
happy, merry years while they are young. And 
I shall want a great deal of love to make up for 
my old starved life. You’ve had the love, you 
see.” 

Could she give him any adequate return? Her 
life seemed so poor and simple. 

‘‘ We have hardly been lovers,” he said, “ so 
we shall have to be lovers all the rest of our lives.” 


 

As for the children they felt as if they had 
been whisked out of the old orbit and were flying 
through space like a comet. 

But you knew, didn’t you, Chan? ” said Ama- 
ryllis. 

'' No, not all of it. He told me about coming 
to keep our Christmas, and I had a feeling that 
then I’d be expected to stay. And I’ve such a 
splendid room and fine bookcase — oh. I’m afraid 
he’s given me too much.” 

But, you see,” returned Linn, he’s going to 
have mother, and she’s worth the whole lot of 
us.” 

She won’t be quite the same to us.” 

‘‘ Mothers don’t forget,” said Linn stoutly. 

And now she won’t have to go out sewing and 
fixing up people’s houses, and — Golly! she’ll be a 
real lady! And she won’t come home all tired 
out. And he’ll buy her beautiful clothes as he 
does Chan. And I know she’ll love us.” 

It’s queer anyhow,” piped in Marigold. But 
he’s just tip-top. I’ve liked him ever since that 
first day. But, Dan, how will you get along 
with such a lot of young ones for good and 
all ? ” 

‘‘ I’m like the boss, I take to children. I meant 
to have some of my own, but that pralasis set in 


 

and left my poor wife like a log. I guess there 
won’t be any trouble,” and Dan chuckled. 

The neighbors watched the sleigh release its 
living freight. Eight children again. But Christ- 
mas didn’t last forever. 

Mrs. Alden took off their wrappings and ushered 
them into the parlor. It had been made fragrant 
with greens and some beautiful flowers, great roses 
such as one seldom saw in the winter. 

“ Why, it looks ’most like a church. Oh, do 
you suppose they will be married here? I never 
saw any one married.” 

“ I did once,” said Amaryllis, at the parsonage. 
But the lady had her hat and cloak on.” 

Do you think I might take them up to my 
room ? ” Chan asked Mrs. Alden. 

Oh, yes. But do not go into any of the 
other rooms.” 

That’s queer,” remarked Marigold. We 
have been in all of them.” 

There were '' ohs ” and '' ahs ” in almost every 
key. For a moment or two Linn envied his 
brother. There were the beautiful books ranged 
on their shelf. The desk was fitted up with need- 
ful articles and on one of the brackets was a vase 
of flowers. On a stand in Mr. Mann’s room there 
was a magnificent bunch. A strange feeling per- 


 

vaded them, all save the twins, and Laurel dis- 
covered that she had left dolly behind and began 
to cry. 

“ Let’s go downstairs and watch for mother,” 
said Amaryllis. “ Dan will go back and get 
dolly, though I don’t think she’s fine enough for 
a house full of flowers like this. Lai, dear, let 
me show you some pictures. Oh, there they 
come ! ” 

It seemed to them as if they must have been 
separated from their mother a whole day instead 
of an hour. And presently Dan came with some 
one else, Mr. and Mrs. Ross, and then they were 
seized with an accession of bashfulness, but 
luncheon soon obviated that. 

Well, they were very passable children, Mrs. 
Ross admitted to herself. Chan and Marigold 
and the smaller twin were really pretty, Linn was 
a manly little fellow, and none of them positively 
plain. Not rough or uncouth either, and their 
mother was modest and sweet if she hadn’t Mrs. 
Alden’s style. 

After that they were led upstairs into one of 
the rooms that had been closed and their breath 
fairly taken away with a pile of finery on the bed. 
Then the girls were metamorphosed from country 
children to fairies, and it was only simple white 


 

frocks and sashes and white stockings and shoes. 
Their mother kissed them and told them to go 
down into the library and be quiet and good chil- 
dren. 

It was positively funny the way they stared at 
each other in breathless silence. Even Primrose 
was awed. Then the boys came down. 

Oh, Linn, you look quite as nice and pretty 
as Chan ! Clothes do make a difference ! ” and 
Prim was an immense point of admiration. 

“ And just look at me,” said Tip, stretching up 
his tallest. 

There were some guests in the parlor. Mr. 
Mann brought them through. 

Here are my children,” he said laughingly. 

They were Mr. and Mrs. Burnham and Katy, 
who stared at them in surprise, and only knew 
Chan. 

“ Not many men begin this way,” returned the 
minister. I hardly know which side is to be 
congratulated.” 

“ Both,” was the host’s answer. 

“ Mr. Mann ” and he left the room. 

“ It was a wonderful surprise when Mr. Mann 
came yesterday and told us,” said Mrs. Burnham 
to Amaryllis. “ It’s a perfect romance, and your 
mother deserves the best of fortune, she’s been so 


 

devoted to you all. Only — I hope you won’t be 
too much lifted up by sudden prosperity.” 

Lifted up?” Amaryllis did not quite under- 
stand. In fact in her simple way she had only 
taken in the good fortune for her mother and a 
new father for them. That they would be set 
above many of the Denby folk who had looked 
down upon them with a sort of pity never oc- 
curred to the inexperienced child. 

Mrs. Alden came to the door in a pretty, light, 
silk gown, and, beckoning them out, formed them 
in a half-circle on each side of the chimney-piece, 
holding little Lai’s hand herself. The others stood 
just back of the children. And then two people 
came through, Mr. Mann in white vest and tie, 
and a beautiful white figure in a clinging gown 
and train with white flowers in her dark hair, and 
as he turned her around, the children really saw 
“ the beautifullest mother ” as they had never seen 
her before. She looked so sweet and girlish, as if 
the beauty of really heroic life had suddenly blos- 
somed out in her face, the seal of the soul taking 
its reward. He was glad to have her children see 
her this way. It would be something to remem- 
ber when they were men and women. 

Then there was a pleasant confusion of voices, 
a moving about, the children were kissed by their 


 

mother and their new father, little laughing sounds, 
and then Mrs. Burnham sat down to the piano and 
played what she could remember of the wedding 
march. After that they went out to the wedding 
feast, where the table was fragrant with flowers, 
with the wedding-cake in the middle. The chil- 
dren were quiet from very surprise, but the 
elders made it cheerful, graciously assisted by the 
host. 

Mr. and Mrs. Ross were taken to their train 
to go on their Christmas journey. 

“ It was really a beautiful wedding,’’ she said, 
‘‘ and would have graced a grander occasion. 
Mrs. Firth — Mrs. Mann, I mean,” laughing, “ is 
certainly much more ladylike than one would ex- 
pect, and the children might have stepped out of 
a story book. No wonder he is proud of them. 
But — eight of them ! ” 

They kept Mr. and Mrs. Burnham a while 
longer, for Katy was just beginning to feel at 
home with the children. 

She must come over and see them,” said Mrs. 
Mann. ‘‘We can send for her almost any time. 
I should think she would get lonely.” 

“ She does, I know. I don’t like her to go to 
school with so many rough children, but being al- 
ways with grown folks is not good for a child 


 

nor natural. Dear me, we shall miss you so 
much, but I do rejoice in your good fortune.” 

It seems like a dream.” Bessie gave a soft 
little laugh. “ I expect Friday morning I shall 
think I ought to go over to the old house and 
take up the old life, as if I was not in quite the 
right place.” 

After the guests went away they retired to the 
library. Lide came in and lighted a fire just for 
the pleasure of the blaze. 

“Oh, Mr. Mann, it was just beautiful!” said 
Marigold with a joyous sigh, if such a thing can 
be. 

“ Mr. Mann ! ” He tried to look severe, but 
the big dimple gave it away. “ Now we are going 
to begin at once. I shall insist upon all the honors 
of a large family and be called * Father.’ I shall 
try to be the best father that I can, and if you do 
not love me a good deal I shall be broken-hearted. 
And the first one that calls me Mr. Mann — well, 
I don’t know what will be done to her or him. I 
think they will have to go over to the little old 
house and live alone.” 

“ Oh, yes, I know,” exclaimed Marigold 
brightly. “ That will be the prison when we’re 
very, very bad. We are sometimes.” 

“ Capital,” and he laughed. 


 

They seemed to get settled presently. Linn 
and Amaryllis were in the front room looking over 
a portfolio of fine engravings and photographs of 
the beautiful scenery of America. Marigold and 
Prim were piecing together a dissecting map on 
the floor. Rhoda was building a house of domi- 
noes. Tip sat on a taboret studying the fire. 
Mr. Mann was in the big chair with Chan perched 
on one arm and leaning his face down on the broad 
shoulder. It was not as gay as Thanksgiving had 
been, perhaps they all felt that something mys- 
terious had happened to them. 

Mrs. Mann sat beside her husband, and Laurel 
had crawled up into her lap to be comforted for 
the forgotten dolly. It certainly was a picture of 
household content, and Adonijah Mann felt thor- 
oughly happy. 

I can’t make it out,” and Tip’s face was 
creased in several lines, ‘‘ just why people are 
married. Did the minister give mother to you? 
And she didn’t belong to him, she belonged to us.” 

Mr. Mann roused from a reverie with his wife’s 
hand in his. Then he gave a short laugh. 

Tip, there was a place in the ceremony where 
Mr. Burnham said, ‘ If any one had any objection 
he should declare it then, or ever afterward hold 
his peace.’ You’ve lost your chance.” 


 

“ But I can’t understand ” 

“ My little lad, she gave herself to me first. 
And what Mr. Burnham said was the custom and 
the law of the land. Everything, you’ll find, is 
governed by some law. But it will be a long 
while before you need bother about marriage. 
You are not homesick already and wanting to go 
back ? ” 

“ No-o,” in a rather doubtful tone. “ This place 
is nicer, and you’ve so many beautiful things, and 
the horses and sleighs, and turkey for dinner all 
the time, and such splendid cake with sugar on 
the top ” 

Oh, Tip ! ” and his mother’s face was scarlet. 

“ I’ll stay here while you do — — ” 

And I’d like to know whether we will all 
have to change our names like mother,” inquired 
Marigold, looking up suddenly. 

Mr. Mann considered. “ No,” he answered 
presently. “ I think your name the prettiest, 
much prettier for girls.” 

Marigold Mann ! Well, that would sound 
funny. And Primrose Mann ! ” laughing. 

“ Yes, your name is much to be preferred.” 

“ I want my dolly,” piped a sleepy voice. “ And 
I want to go in my trundle-bed. My eyes won’t 
stay open.” 


 

Family cares begin/’ and Bessy Mann looked 
at her husband in a humorous fashion. Come, 
Rhoda, you must go.” 

“ I can’t leave my house. And I’m not sleepy,” 
in a resolute tone. 

Rhoda ! ” 

And I am afraid to go and sleep in a strange 
place,” in a decisive manner. 

Perhaps Dan had better take you over to the 
old house.” Bessy drew a sort of compressed 
breath, she deprecated a struggle. And Rhoda 
could be very willful. 

Mr. Mann rose quietly and swooped down on 
the child, gathering her in his arms, and kissing 
the protesting lips, half squeezing the breath out 
of her as he carried her upstairs. Her mother 
followed with Laurel. 

Family cares are coming soon,” she said with 
a deprecating smile. ‘‘ Thank you. I can man- 
age them now.” 

“ Rhoda, any little girl that cries cannot have 
her stocking hung up.” 

Rhoda had really been too much startled to cry 
by the summary treatment. She looked at him 
now with wide open eyes a little defiant. 

Say good-night to father.” 

I tan’t,” murmured Lai. “ I so s’eepy.” 




So he kissed them both and left them to their 
mother. 

Marigold was tired of puzzling over the map. 
She picked up the pieces and the dominoes, and 
laid them on the table. Then she said, '' I wonder 
if rich people hang up stockings. Teacher said 
there wasn’t any Santa Claus, just as if we didn’t 
know when we began to learn about things. But 
it’s the most splendid make-believe I know of.” 

“ What is ? ” asked Mr. Mann. Then he drew 
his chair up nearer, took Chan on one knee, and 
lifted Tip to the other. 

Why — Santa Claus. And can we hang up 
some stockings ? ” 

“ Of course you can. That’s half the fun of 
Christmas.” 

“ I’m so glad you like fun,” and Prim squeezed 
the arm nearer her. 

And I hope we shall have lots of it. I didn’t 
have much when I was a little boy. But then I 
didn’t have any mother.” 

“ And mothers are such lovely things,” said 
Chan. “ Better than anything in the wide world.” 

Mr. Mann smiled down into the little face. 

Mother came down smiling as if the trouble 
hadn’t been very serious. She glanced into the 
other room. 


 

Come in here, Linn and Rilla.” They seemed 
somehow rather shut out. 

“ We’ve been having a nice time over the pic- 
tures,” explained Amaryllis. “ What beautiful 
places there are in the world. How delightful it 
would be to see them. Linn and I have been 
planning when we are quite grown up to — to do 
something ” 

We may not wait so long as that,” said their 
new father. I’ve never been about much only 
on business journeys.”
