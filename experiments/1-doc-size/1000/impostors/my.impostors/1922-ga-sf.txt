go out at night?" 

" Yes — I — I sleep in the daytime." 



 

"Look here — I have a plan — I won't 
tell you what it is now — but meanwhile I wish 
you would promise me that you will not go out 
alone — to hells of this sort — again, I can 
make an arrangement for a while at the office to 
get off earlier, and I'll take you wherever you 
want to go. Is it a bargain?'' 

" Very well," she said indifferently. Then 
she smiled for the first time, and her face looked 
sweet and almost girlish once more. " You are 
very kind. Why do you take so much interest? 
I am only one more derelict. You must have 
seen many." 

" Well, I'm just built that way. I took a 
shine to you the day in that old ark we ambled 
about in, and then I'm as fond of Masters as 
ever. D'you see? Now, let's get out of this. 
I'm going to see you home." 

"Home!" 

" Well, I'm glad the word gives you a shock, 
anyway. It's where you ought to be." 

They left the restaurant and although, when 
they reached the sidewalk, she took his arm, he 
noticed that she did not stagger. 

They walked up the hill past the north side 
of the Plaza. The gambling houses of the 



 

fifties and early sixties had moved elsewhere, 
and although there were low-browed shops on 
the east side with flaring gas jets before them 
even at this hour, the other three sides, devoted 
to oflices and rooming-houses, were respectable. 
There were a few drunken sdlors on the grass, 
who had wandered too far from Barbary Coast, 
but they were asleep. 

" I never am molested here," she said. " I 
don't think I have ever met any one. Sometimes I have stood in the shadow up there and 
looked down Dupont Street. What a sight! 
Respectable Montgomery Street is never so 
crowded at four in the afternoon. And the 
women! Sometimes I have envied them, for 
life has never meant anything to them but just 
that. I never saw one of those painted harlots 
who looked as if she had even the remnants of 
a mind." 

" Well, for heaven's sake keep your distance 
from Dupont Street. If some drunken brute 
caught you lurking in the shadows it might 
appeal to his sense of humor to toss you on his 
shoulder and run the length of the street with 
you — possibly fling you through one of the 
windows of those awful cottages into some harlot's lap, if she happened to be soliciting at the 
moment. Then she'd scratch your eyes out. . .  
You know a lot about taking care of yourself," 
he fumed. 

" Oh, I never go there any more," she said 
indifferently. " I'm tired of it." 

" I can understand you leaving your husband 
and wishing to live alone — natural enough! — 
but what I cannot imderstand is that you, the 
quintessence of delicate breeding, should walk 
the streets at night and sit in dives. I wonder 
you can stand being in the room with such 
women, to say nothing of the men." 

" It has been my hope to forget all I represented before, and danger means nothing to me. 
Moreover, there are other reasons. I must 
have exercise and air. I do not care to risk 
meeting any of my old friends. I must get 
away from myself — from solitude — during 
some part of the twenty-four hours. And — 
well — the die was cast. I was publicly disgraced. It doesn't matter what I do now, and 
when I sit in that sort of place I can imagine 
that he is in similar ones on the other side of the 
continent. I told you that I intended to be no 
better than he — and of course as I am a woman 
I am worse." 



 

" I suppose you would not be half so charming if you were not so completely feminine. 
But just how many of these night hells have 
you been to?" 

" I can't tell. I've been to far worse dives 
than that. Pve even been in saloons over on 
Barbary Coast. But although Pve been hurt 
accidentally several times in scuffles, and a bullet 
nearly hit me once, I seem to bear a charmed 
life. I suppose those do that want to die. And 
although they treat me with no respect they 
seem to regard me as a harmless lunatic, and — 
and — I take very little when I am out. I have 
just enough pride left not to care to be taken 
to the calaboose by a policeman." 

" Good God! How can you even talk of 
such things? Some day you will regret all this 
horribly." 

" I'll never regret anything except that I was 
born." 

" Well, here we are. I'll not take you up to 
your rooms. Don't give them a chance at that 
sort of scandal whatever you do. It's lucky for 
you that idcohol doesn't send you along a still 
livelier road to perdition. It does most women." 

" I see him every moment. Even if I did 




not, I do not think — well, of course if things 
were difFerent I should not be an outcast of any 
sort. And don't imagine that my refinement 
suffers in these new contacts. The underworld 
interests me; I had never even tried to imagine 
it before. I am permitted to remain aloof and 
a spectator. At times it is all as unreal as I seem 
to myself, sitting there. But I never feel so 
close to vice as to complete honesty. I have 
often had glimpses of blacker sins in Sodety." 
" Well, I'm glad it's no worse. To tell you 
the truth, I've avoided looking you up, for I 
didn't know — well, I didn't want to see you 
again if you were too different. Good-night. 
I'll meet you at this door tonight at twelve 
sharp." 





THERE were dcx:tors' offices on the first 
floor and Madeleine climbed wearily the 
two flights to her room. Her muscles felt as 
tired as her spirit, but she had an odd fancy 
that her skeleton was of fine flexible steel and 
not only indestructible but tenacious and domi- 
nant. It defied the worst she could do to organs 
and soul. 

She unlocked her door and lit the gas jet. 
It was a decent room, large, with the bed in an 
alcove, and little uglier than those grim double 
parlors of her past that she had graced so often. 
But her own rooms at the hotel had been beauti- 
ful and luxurious. They had sheltered and 
pampered her body for five years, and her 
father's house was a stately mansion, refurnished, with the exception of old colonial pieces, 
after the grand tour in Europe. This room, 
although clean and sufficiently equipped, was 
sordid and commonplace, and the bed was as 
hard as the horsehair furniture. Her body as 

  

well as her aesthetic sense had rebelled more 
than once. 

But she would never return j although she 
guessed that the complete dissociation from her 
old life and its tragic reminders had more than 
a little to do with the loathing for drink that 
had gradually possessed hen She had not 
admitted it to Holt, but it required a supreme 
effort of will to take a glass of hot whiskey and 
water at night, the taste disguised as much as 
possible by lime juice, and another in the day- 
time. She had no desire to reform! And she 
longed passionately to drown not only her heart 
but her pride. Now that her system was refusing its demoralizing drug she felt that horror 
of her descent only possible to a woman who 
has inherited and practised all the refinements 
of dvilization. She longed to return to those 
first months of degraded oblivion, and could 
not! 

The champagne or brandy she was forced to 
order in the dives she haunted, in order to secure 
a table> merely gave her tone for the moment. 

Her nerves were less affected than her spirits. 
She had hours of such black depression that only 
the faint glimmering star of religion kept her 



 

from suicide. She had longer seasons for 
thought on Masters and his ruin — and of the 
hours they had spent together. One night she 
went out to Dolores and sat in the dark little 
church until dawn. She had nothing of the 
saint in her and felt no impulse to emulate 
Concha Arguello, who had become the first nun 
in California J moreover, Razanov had died an 
honorable death through no fault of his or his 
Concha's. She and Langdon Masters were lost 
souls and must expiate their sins in the eyes of 
the world that heaped on their heads its pitiless 
scorn. 

Madeleine threw off her hat and dropped into 
the armchair, oblivious of its bumps. She 
began to cry quietly with none of her former 
hysteria. Holt was nearer to Masters than any 
one she knew, and she was grateful that he had 
not seen her in her hours of supreme degradation. If he ever saw Masters again he would 
tell him of her downfall, of course — and the 
reason for itj but at least he could paint no 
horrible concrete picture. For the first time 
she felt thankful that she had not sxmk lower 
been compelled, indeed, against her will, to 
retrace her steps. She even regretted the 





hideous episode of the ferry boat, although she 
had welcomed the exposure at the time. Her 
pride was lifting its battered head, and although 
she felt no remorse, and was without hope, and 
her unclouded consciousness foreshadowed long 
years of spiritual torment and longing with not 
a diversion to lighten the gloom, she possessed 
herself more nearly that night than since Holt 
had given her what she had believed to be her 
death blow. 

If she could only die. But death was no 
friend of hers. 




THAT afternoon Holt called on Dr. Tal- 
bot in his office. Half an hour later, 
looking flushed and angry, he strolled frowning 
down Bush street, then turned abruptly and 
walked in the direction of South Park. He did 
not know Mrs. McLane but he believed she 
would see him. 

He called at midnight — and on many succeeding nights — for Madeleine and took her 
to several of the dives that seemed to afford her 
amusement. He noticed that she drank little, 
and had a glimmering of the truth. News- 
paper men have several extra senses. It was 
also apparent that the life she had led had not 
made her callous. As he insisted upon " treating " her she would have none of champagne 
but ordered ponies of brandy. 

Now that she had a cavalier she was stared 
at more than formerly, and there was some 
audible ribald comment which Holt did his 
best to ignore J but as time wore on those bent 


 

on hilarity or stupor ceased to notice two people 
uninterestingly sober. 

Holt talked of Masters constantly, relating 
every incident of his sojourn in San Francisco 
he could recall, and of his past that had come to 
his knowledge; expatiating bitterly upon his 
wasted gifts and blasted life. The more Madeleine winced the further he drove in the knife- 
One night they were sitting on a balcony in 
Chinatown. In the restaurant behind them a 
banquet was being given by a party of Chinese 
merchants, and Holt had thought the scene 
might amuse her. The round table was covered 
with dishes no larger than those played with in 
childhood and the portions were as minute. 
The sleek merchants wore gorgeously embroidered costumes, and behind them were women of 
their own race, dressed plainly in the national 
garb, their stiff oiled hair stuck with long pins 
lobed with glass. They were evidently an or- 
chestra, for they sang, or rather chanted, in high 
monotonous voices, as mournful as their gray 
expressionless faces. In two recesses, extended 
on teakwood couches, were Chinamen presumably of the same class as the diners, but wearing 
their daily blue silk imadomed and leisurely 



 

smoking the opium pipe. The room was heavily 
gilded and decorated and on the third floor as 
befitted its rank. Chinamen of humbler status 
dined on the floor below, and the ground restaurant accommodated the coolies. 

On the little balcony, their chairs wedged 
between large vases of growing plants, Madeleine could watch the function without attracting attention or lean over the railing and look 
down upon the narrow street hung with gay 
paper lanterns above the open doors of shops 
that flaunted the wares of the Orient irnder 
strange gilt signs. There were many little 
balconies high above the street and they were 
as brilliantly lit as for a festival. From several 
came the sound of raucous instrumental music 
or that same thin chant as of lost souls wandering in outer darkness. The street was thronged 
with Chinamen of the lower caste in dark blue 
cotton smocks, pendent pigtails, and round 
coolie hats. 

It was eight o'clock, but it was Holt's " night 
off " and as he had told her that morning he 
could get a pass for the dinner, and that it was 
time she " changed her bill," she had risen early 
and met him at her door. 



 

It was apparent that she took a lively interest 
in this bit of Shanghai b^t a step out of the 
Occident, for her face had lost its heavy brooding and she asked him many questions. It was 
an hour before Masters' name was mentioned, 
and then she said abruptly: 

" You tell me much of his life out here and 
before he came, but you hardly ever say anything about the present." 

" That sort of life is much of a muchness." 

" How do you hear?" 

" One of the Bulletin men — Tom Lacey — 
went East just after Masters did. He is on the 
Times. Several of us correspond with him." 

" Has — has he ever been — literally, I 
mean — in the gutter?" 

" Probably. He was in a hospital for a time 
and when he came out several of his friends 
tried to buck him up. But it was no use. He 
did work on one of the newspapers — the 
Tribune y I believe — about half sober until he 
had paid his hospital bill with something to 
spare. Then he went to work in the same old 
steady painstaking way to drink himself to 
death." 

"Wh — why did he go to the hospital? 
Was he very ill?" 



 

" Busted the crust of a policeman and got his 
own busted at the same time.'' 

" How is it you spared me this before?" 

He pretended not to see her tears, or her 
working hands. 

"Didn't want to give you too heavy doses 
at once, but you are so much stronger that I 
chanced it. He's been in more than one spectacular affair. One night, in front of the City 
Prison, he tossed the driver off a van as if the 
man had been a dead leaf, and before the guard 
had time to jump to his seat he was on the box 
and had lashed the horses. He drove like mad 
all over New York for hours, the prisoners inside yelling and cursing at the top of their 
lungs. They thought it was a new and devilishly ingenious mode of punishment. When 
the horses dropped he left the van where it 
stood and went home. There was a frightful 
row over the affair. Masters was arrested, of 
course, but bailed out. He has friends still 
and some of them are influential. The trial 
was postponed a few times and then dropped. 
His rows are too numerous to mention. When 
he was here and sober he betrayed anger only 
in his eyes, which looked like steel blades run 



 

through fire, and with the most caustic tongue 
ever put in a man's head. But when he's in 
certain stages of insobriety his fighting instincts 
appear to take their own sweet way. At other 
times, Lacey writes, he is as interesting as ever 
and men sit round eagerly and listen to him 
talk. At others he simply disappears. Did I 
tell you he had come into a little money — just 
recently?'' 

" No, you did not. Why doesn't he start a 
newspaper?" 

"He's probably forgotten he ever wanted 
one — no, I don't fancy he ever forgets anything. Only death will destroy that brain 
no matter how he may obfuscate it. And I 
guess there are times when he can't, poor devil. 
But he couldn't start a newspaper on what he's 
got. It's just enough to buy him all he wants 
without the necessity for work." 

" How did he get it?" 

" His elder brother — only remaining member of the immediate family — died and left 
him the old plantation in Virgina — what there 
is left of it J and a small income from two or 
three old houses in Richmond. Masters told 
me once that when the war left them high and 



 

dry he agreed to waive his share in the estate 
provided his brother would take care of his 
mother and the old place. The estate comes to 
him now, but in trust. At his death, without 
legal heir, it goes to a cousin." 

" Oh, take me home, please. I can't stand 
those wailing women any longer." 



XXXVIII 

A MONTH later there was a tap on Made- 
leine's door. She rose earlier these days 
and opened it at once, assuming that it was a 
message from Holt. But Mr. McLane stood 
there. 

" How are you, Madeleine? May I come 
in?" He shook her half -extended hand as if 
he were paying her an afternoon call at the 
Occidental Hotel, and sat down on the horse- 
hair sofa with a genial smile; pladng his high 
silk hat and gold-headed cane beside him. 

"Glad to see you looking so well. I've 
wanted to call for a long time, but as you 
dropped us all like so many hot potatoes, I 
hesitated, and was delighted today when 
Howard gave me an excuse.'' 

" Howard?" 

" Yes, he wants you to go back to him." 

" That I'll never do." 

" Don't be hasty. He is willing to forget 
everything — he asked me to make you understand that he would never mention the subject. 
He will also put your share of your father's 
estate unreservedly in your hands as soon as the 
usual legal delays are over. You knew that 
your father was dead, did you not? And your 
mother also?" 

" Oh yes, I knew. It didn't seem to make 
any difference. I knew I never should see them 
again anyhow." 

" Howard was appointed trustee of your inheritance, but as I said, he does not mean to take 
advantage of the fact. I am informed, by the 
way, that your brother never told your parents 
that you had left Howard. He knew nothing 
beyond the fact, of course." 

« Well, I am glad of that." 

She had no intention of shedding any tears 
before Mr. McLane. Let him think her callous 
if he must. 

"About Howard?" 

" I'll never go back to him. I never want 
to see him again." 

"Not if he would take you to Europe to live? 
There is ^n opening for an American doctor in 
Paris." 

" I never want to see him again. I know he 



 

is a good man but I hate him. And if I did go
back it would be worse. You may tell him 
that.'' 

" Is your decision irrevocable?" 

" Yes, it is.'' 

" Then I must tell you that if there is no 
prospect of your return he will divorce you." 

"Divorced — I divorced?" Her eyes expanded with horrified astonishment. But only 
for a moment. She threw bade her head and 
laughed. "That was funny, wasn't it? Well, 
let him do as he thinks best. And he may be 
happy once more if I am out of his life altogether. He won't have much trouble getting 
a divorce!" 

" He will obtain it on the ground of desertion." 

"Oh! Well, he was always a very good 
man. Poor Howard! I hope he'll marry 
again and be happy." 

" Better think it over. I — by the way — 
I'm not sure the women wouldn't come round in 
time} particularly if you lived abroad for a 
few years." 

She curled her lip. " And I should have my 
precious position in Society again! How much 



 

do you suppose that means to me? Have the 
fatted calf killed and coals of fire poured on 
my humbled head! Do you think I have no 
pride?" 

"You appear to have regained it. I wish 
you could regain the rest and be the radiant 
creature you were when you came to us. God! 
What a lovely stunning creature you were! It 
hurts me like the devil, I can tell you. And 
it's hurt the women too. They were fond of 
you. Do you know that Sally is dead?" 

" Yes. She had everjrthing to live for and 
she died. Life seems to amuse herself with 
us.'' 

" She's a damned old hag." He rose and 
took up his hat and cane. " Well, I'll wait a 
week, and then if you don't relent the proceedings will begin. I shan't get the divorce. Not 
my line. But he asked me to talk to you and I 
was glad to come. Good-by." 

She smiled as she shook hands with him. As 
he opened the door he turned to her again. 

" That young Holt is a good fellow and has 
a head on his shoulders. Better be guided by 
him if he offers you any advice." 



XXXIX 

ALMOST insensibly and without comment 
Madeleine fell into the habit of sleeping 
at night and going abroad with Holt in the day- 
time. Nor did he take her to any more dives. 
They went across the Bay, either to Oakland 
or Sausalito, and took long walks, dining at 
some inn where they were sure to meet no one 
they knew. She had asked hiiti to buy her 
books, as she did not care to venture either into 
the bookstores or the Mercantile Library. She 
now had a part of her new income to spend as 
she chose, and moved into more comfortable 
rooms, although far from the fashionable 
quarter. She was restless and often very 
nervous but Holt knew that she drank no 
longer. There had been another revolution of 
the wheel : she would have a large income, freedom impended, the future was hers to dispose 
of at will. Her health was excellent  she had 
regained her old proud bearing. 

"What are you going to do with it?" he 





 

asked her abruptly one evening. They were 
sitting in the arbor of a restaurant on the water 
front at Sausalito and had just finished dinner. 
The steep promontory rose behind them a wild 
forest of oak and pine, madrona and chaparral. 
Across the sparkling dark green water San 
Francisco looked a pale blue in the twilight and 
there was a banner of soft pink above her. 
Lights were appearing on the military islands, 
the ferry boats, and yachts. " You will be free 
in about a month now. Have you made any 
plans? You will not stay here, of course." 

" Stay here ! I shall leave the day the decree 
is granted, and Pll never see California again 
as long as I live." 

" But where shall you go?'' 

" Oh — it would be interesting to live in 
Europe." 

" Whether you have admitted it to yourself 
or not you have not the remotest idea of going 
to Europe." 

"Oh?" 

" You are going to Langdon Masters. Nothing in the world could keep you away from 
him — or should." 

" I wish women smoked. You look so placid. 
And I am glad you smoke cigarettes." 



 

"Why not try one?" 

" Oh, no! " She looked scandalized. " I 
never did that — before. The other was for 
a purpose, not because I liked it." 

" I am used to your line of ratiocination. But 
you haven't answered my question." 

" Did you ask one?" 

" In the form of an assertion, yes." 

" You know — the Church forbids marriage 
after divorce." 

"Look here, Madeleine!" Holt brought 
his fist down on the table with such violence that 
she half started to her feet. " Do you mean to 
tell me you are going to let any more damn 
foolishness wreck your life a second time?" 

" You must not speak of the Church in that 
way." 

"Let that pass. I am not going to argue 
with you. You've argued it all out with yourself unless I'm much mistaken. Are you going 
to let Masters kill himself when you can save 
him? Are you going to condemn yourself to 
a miserably solitary, wandering, aimless life, in 
which you are no good to yourself, your Church, 
or any one on earth — and with a crime on 
your soul?" 



 

" I — I — haven't admitted to myself what 
I shall do. It has seemed to me that when I 
am free I shall simply go — " 

"And straight to Masters. As well for a 
needle to try to run away from a magnet." 

" Oh, I wonder! I wonder! " But she did not 
look distressed. Her face was transfigured as 
if she saw a vision. But it fell in a moment, 
that inner glowing lamp extinguished. 

" He may no longer want me. He may have 
forgotten me. Or if he remembers it must only 
be to remind himself that I have ruined his 
life. He may hate me." 

" That is likely! If he hated you he'd have 
pulled up long ago. He knows he still has it 
in him to make a name for himself, whether 
he owns a newspaper or not. If he's gone on 
making a fool of himself it's because his longing 
for you is insupportable j he can forget you in 
no other way." 

" Can men really love like that ? " The inner 
lamp glowed again. 

"A few. Not many, perhaps. Langdon's 
one of them. Case of a rare whole being 
chopped in two by fate and both halves bleeding to death without the other. There are a 



 

few immortal love affairs in the world's history, 
and that's just what makes 'em immortal." 

She did not answer, but sat staring at the 
rosy peaceful light above the fiery duty that 
had burnt out so many lives. Then her face 
changed suddenly. It was set and determined, 
almost hard. He thought she looked like a 
beautiful Medusa. 

" Yes," she said. " I am going to him. I 
suppose I have known it all along. At all 
events I know it now." 

" And what is your plan?" 

" I have had no time to make one yet." 

" Will you listen to mine?" 

"Do not I always listen to you with the 
greatest respect?" She was the charming 
woman again. " Mr. McLane told me that I 
was to follow your advice — I have an idea 
you have engineered this whole affair! — But 
if he hadn't — well, I have every reason to be 
hmnbly grateful to you. If this terrible tangle 
ever unravels I shall owe it to you." 

" Then listen to me now. What I said — 
that his actions prove that he cares for you as 
much as ever — is true. But — you might 
come upon him in a condition where he would 



 

not recognize you, or was morose from too 
much drink or too little  and for the moment 
he would hate you, either because you reminded 
him too forcibly of what he had been and was, 
or because it degraded him further to be seen 
by you in such a state. He could make himself excessively disagreeable sober. Drunk, 
panic stricken, reckless, I should think he might 
achieve a masterpiece in that line that would 
make you feel like ten cents. . • . This is my 
plan, ni go on at once and prepare him. 
Get him down to his home in Virginia on one 
pretence or another, sober him up by degrees, 
and then tell him all you have been through 
for his sake, and that as soon as you are free 
you will come to him. He'll be a little more 
like himself by that time and can stand having 
you look at him, . , . It'll be no easy task at 
first} and Pll have to taper him off to prevent 
any blow to his heart. There may be relapses, 
and the whole thing to do over; but I shall use 
the talisman of your name as soon as he is in a 
condition to understand, and shall succeed in 
the end. Once let the idea take hold of him 
that he can have you at last and it is only a 
question of time." 



 

She made no reply for a moment. She sat 
with her eyes on his as he spoke. At first they 
had opened widely, melted and flashed. But 
they narrowed slowly. As he finished she 
tiirned her profile toward him and he had never 
seen a cameo look harder. 

" That would be an easy way out," she said. 
" But it does not appeal to me. Nothing easy 
appeals to me these days. 1^11 fight my own 
battles and overcome my own obstacles. Besides, he's mine. He shall owe nothing to any 
one but to me. I'll find him and cure him 
myself." 

" But you'll have a hard time finding him. 
He disappears for weeks at a time. Even Tom 
Lacey might not be able to help you." 

" I'llfind him." 

" You may have to haunt the most abominable places." 

" You seem to forget that I have haunted a 
good many abominable places. And if they are 
good enough for him they are good enough 
for me." 

" New York has the worst set of roughs in the 
world. Our hoodlums are lambs beside them." 

" I have no fear of anything but not finding 
him in time." 



 

" But that is not the worst. You should not 
see him in that state. You might find him literally in the gutter. He might be a sight you 
never could forget. No matter what you made 
of him you never could obliterate such a hideous 
memory. And he might say things to you that 
your outraged pride would never forgive," 

" I can forget anything I choose. Nor could 
anything he said, nor anything he may have 
become, horrify me. Don't you think I have 
pictured all that? I think of him every moment 
and I am not a coward. I have imagined 
things that may be worse than the reality.'' 

"Hardly. But there is another danger. 
You might kidnap him and get him sobered up, 
only to lose him again. He might be so overcome with shame that he would cut loose and 
hide where you would never find him. Remember, his pride was as great as yours." 

" I'd track him to the ends of the earth. 
He's mine and I'll have him." 

Holt stared at her for a moment in perplexity, then laughed. "You are a liberal 
education, Madeleine. Just as I think I really 
know you at last you break out in a new place. 
Masters will have an interesting life. You 



 

must be a sort of continued-in-our-next story 
for any one who has the right to love and live 
with you. But for any one else who has loved 
you it must be death and damnation." 

She stole a glance at him, wondering if he 
loved her. If he did he had never made a sign, 
and at the moment he seemed to be appraising 
her with his sharp cool blue eyes. 

"I was thinking of the doctor," he said 
calmly. "Although, of course, there must 
have been a good many in a more or less idiotic 
state over the reigning toast." 

" The reigning toast! . . . Well, I'll never 
be that again. But it won't matter if — when — 
You are to promise me you will not write to 
him!" 

" Oh, yes, I promise." Holt had been rapidly 
formulating his own plans. " But you'll let me 
give you a letter to Lacey? It's a wild goose 
chase but a little advice might help." 

" I should have asked you for a line to Mr. 
Lacey. I don't wish to waste time if I can help 
it." 

He rose. "Well, there's a pile of blank 
paper and a soft pencil waiting for me. I've an 
editorial to write on the low-lived politics of 



 

San Franciscoy and another on the increasing 
niunber of murders in our fair city. Look at 
the fog sailing in through the Golden Gate, 
pushing itself along like the prow of a ship. 
You'll never see anything as beautiful as California again. But I suppose that worries you 
a lot.'' 

She smiled, a little mysterious smile, but she 
did not reply, and they walked down to the 
ferry slip in silence. 





MADELEINE went directly from the 
train to Printing House Square and had 
a long talk with " Tom '' Lacey. He had been 
advised of her coming and her quest and had 
already made a search for Masters, but without 
result. This he had no intention of imparting, 
however, but told her a carefully prepared 
story. 

Masters had been writing regularly for some 
time and it was generally believed among his 
friends that he had pulled up in a measure, but 
where he was hiding himself no one knew. 
Cheques and suggestions were sent to the Post 
Office, but he had no box, nor did he call for 
his mail in person. 

He appeared no more at the restaurants in 
Nassau or Fulton Streets, or in Park Row, and 
it would be idle to look for him up town. It 
was apparent that he wished to avoid his friends, 
and to do this effectually he had probably 
hidden himself in one of the rabbit warrens of 





 

Nassau Street, where the King of England or 
the Czar of all the Russias might hide for a 
lifetime and never be found. But Masters 
could be " located," no doubt of that. " It only 
needs patience and alertness,'' said Lacey, looking straight into Madeleine's vigilant eyes. " I 
have a friend on the police force down there 
who will spot him before long and send for me 
hot-foot." 

It was Lacey's intention to sublet a small 
office in one of the swarming buildings, put a 
cot in it and a cooking stove, and transfer 
Masters to it as soon as he was found. He 
knew what some of Masters' haunts were and 
had no intention that this delicate proud woman 
should see him in any of them. 

When she told him that she should never 
leave Masters again after his whereabouts had 
been discovered, he warned her not to take 
rooms in a hotel. There would be unpleasant 
espionage, possibly newspaper scandal. There 
was nothing for it but Bleecker Street. It was 
outwardly quiet, the rooms were large and comfortable in many of those once-fashionable 
houses, and it was the one street in New York 
where no questions were asked and no curiosity 



 

felt. It was no place for her, of course — but 
under the circumstances — if she persisted in 
her idea of keeping Masters with her until ids 
complete recovery — 

" My neighbors will not worry me,'' she said, 
smiling for the first time. " It seems to be 
just the place. I already feel bewildered in 
this great rushing noisy city. I have lived in 
a small city for so long that I had almost forgotten there were great ones} and I should not 
know what to do without your advice. I am 
very grateful." 

" Glad to do anything I can. When Holt 
wrote me you were coming and there was a 
chance to pull Masters out of the — put him on
