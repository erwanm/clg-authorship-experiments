kind woman at moments it seemed to her that this 
would give her comfort, and she had more than once 
been on the point of taking the landlady, or the nice 
young person from the dress-maker's, into her con- 
fidence. If a woman had been near her, she would 
on certain occasions have treated such a companion 
to a fit of weeping ; and she had an apprehension 
that, on her return, this would form her response to 
Aunt Lavinia's first embrace. In fact, however, the 
two ladies had met, in Washington Square, without 
tears ; and when they found themselves alone to- 





gether a certain dryness fell upon the girl's emo- 
tion. It came over her with a greater force that 
Mrs. Penniman had enjoyed a whole year of her 
lover's society, and it was not a pleasure to her to 
hear her aunt explain and interpret the young man, 
speaking of him as if her own knowledge of him 
were supreme. It was not that Catherine was jeal- 
ous; but her sense of Mrs. Penniman's innocent 
falsity, which had lain dormant, began to haunt her 
again, and she was glad that she was safely at home. 
With this, however, it was a blessing to be able to 
talk of Morris, to sound his name, to be with a per- 
son who was not unjust to him. 

" You have been very kind to him," said Cath- 
erine. "He has written me that, often. I shall 
never forget that, Aunt Lavinia." 

" I have done what I could ; it has been very lit- 
tle. To let him come and talk to me, and give him 
his cup of tea that was all. Your aunt Almond 
thought it was too much, and used to scold me ter- 
ribly ; but she promised me, at least, not to betray 
me." 

"To betray you?" 

" Not to tell your father. He used to sit in your 
father's study," said Mrs. Penniman, with a little 
laugh. 

Catherine was silent a moment. This idea was 
disagreeable to her, and she was reminded again, 
with pain, of her aunt's secretive habits. Morris, 
the reader may be informed, had had the tact not to 
tell her that he sat in her father's study. He had 
known her but for a few months, and her aunt had 
known her for fifteen years; and yet he would not 





have made the mistake of thinking that Catherine 
would see the joke of the thing. " I am sorry you 
made him go into father's room," she said, after 
awhile. 

" I didn't send him ; he went himself. He liked 
to look at the books, and at all those things in the 
glass cases. He knows all about them ; he knows 
all about everything." 

Catherine was silent again ; then, " I wish he had 
found some employment," she said. 

"He has found some employment. It's beauti- 
ful news, and he told me to tell you as soon as you 
arrived. He has gone into partnership with a com- 
mission merchant. It was all settled, quite sudden- 
ly, a week ago." 

This seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news ; 
it had a fine prosperous air. " Oh, I'm so glad !" 
she said ; and now, for a moment, she was disposed 
to throw herself on Aunt Lavinia's neck. 

"It's much better than being under some one; 
and he has never been used to that," Mrs. Penniman 
went on. " He is just as good as his partner they 
are perfectly equal. You see how right he was to 
wait. I should like to know what your father can 
say now ! They have got an office in Duane Street, 
and little printed cards ; he brought me one to show 
me. I have got it in my room, and you shall see it 
to-morrow. That's what he said to me the last time 
he was here * You see how right I was to wait.' 
He has got other people under him instead of being 
a subordinate. He could never be a subordinate ; 
I have often told him I could never think of him in 
that way." 




"I SHALL REGARD IT ONLY AS A LOAN," SHE SAID. 





Catherine assented to this proposition, and was 
very happy to know that Morris was his own mas- 
ter; but she was deprived of the satisfaction of 
thinking that she might communicate this news in 
triumph to her father. Her father would care 
equally little whether Morris were established in 
business or transported for life. Her trunks had 
been brought into her room, and further reference 
to her lover was for a short time suspended, while 
she opened them and displayed to her aunt some of 
the spoils of foreign travel. These were rich and 
abundant ; and Catherine had brought home a pres- 
ent to every one to every one save Morris, to whom 
she had brought simply her undiverted heart. To 
Mrs. Penniman she had been lavishly generous, and 
Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and 
folding again, with little ejaculations of gratitude 
and taste. She marched about for some time in a 
splendid cashmere shawl, which Catherine had beg- 
ged her to accept, settling it on her shoulders, and 
twisting down her head to see how low the point 
descended behind. 

" I shall regard it only as a loan," she said. " I 
will leave it to you again when I die ; or, rather," 
she added, kissing her niece again, " I will leave it 
to your first-born little girl." And draped in her 
shawl, she stood there smiling. 

" You had better wait till she comes," said Cath- 
erine. 

" I don't like the way you say that," Mrs. Penni- 
man rejoined, in a moment. " Catherine, are you 
changed ?" 

" No ; I am the same." 





" You have not swerved a line ?" 

"I am exactly the same," Catherine repeated, 
wishing her aunt were a little less sympathetic. 

" Well, I am glad ;" and Mrs. Penniman surveyed 
her cashmere in the glass. Then, " How is your fa- 
ther ?" she asked, in a moment, with her eyes on 
her niece. " Your letters were so meagre I could 
never tell." 

" Father is very well." 

" Ah, you know what I mean," said Mrs. Penni- 
man, with a dignity to which the cashmere gave a 
richer effect. " Is he still implacable ?" 

" Oh yes !" 

" Quite unchanged 3" 

" He is, if possible, more firm." 

Mrs. Penniman took off her great shawl, and slow- 
ly folded it up. " That is very bad. You had no 
success with your little project." 

"What little project?" 

" Morris told me all about it. The idea of turn- 
ing the tables on him, in Europe ; of watching him, 
when he was agreeably impressed by some cele- 
brated sight he pretends to be so artistic, you 
know and then just pleading with him and bring- 
ing him round." 

" I never tried it. It was Morris's idea ; but if 
he had been with us in Europe, he would have seen 
that father was never impressed in that way. He 
is artistic tremendously artistic ; but the more cel- 
ebrated places we visited, and the more he admired 
them, the less use it would have been to plead with 
him. They seemed only to make him more deter- 
mined more terrible," said poor Catherine. "I 





shall never bring him round, and I expect nothing 
now." 

" Well, I must say," Mrs. Penniman answered, 
" I never supposed you were going to give it up." 

" I have given it up. I don't care now." 

" You have grown very brave," said Mrs. Penni- 
man, with a short laugh. " I didn't advise you to 
sacrifice your property." 

" Yes, I am braver than I was. You asked me if 
I had changed ; I have changed in that way. Oh," 
the girl went on, " I have changed very much. And 
it isn't my property. If lie doesn't care for it, why 
should I?" 

Mrs. Penniman hesitated. " Perhaps he does care 
for it." 

" He cares for it for my sake, because he doesn't 
want to injure me. But he will know he knows 
already how little he need be afraid about that. 
Besides," said Catherine, " I have got plenty of mon- 
ey of my own. We shall be very well off ; and now 
hasn't he got his business? I am delighted about 
that business." She went on talking, showing a 
good deal of excitement as she proceeded. Her 
aunt had never seen her with just this manner, and 
Mrs. Penniman, observing her, set it down to for- 
eign travel, which had made her more positive, more 
mature. She thought also that Catherine had im- 
proved in appearance ; she looked rather handsome. 
Mrs. Penniman wondered whether Morris Townsend 
would be struck with that. While she was engaged 
in this speculation, Catherine broke out, with a cer- 
tain sharpness, " Why are you so contradictory, Aunt 
Penniman? You seem to think one thing at one 





time, and another at another. A year ago, before 
yon went away, you wished me not to mind about 
displeasing father, and now you seem to recommend 
me to take another line. You change about so." 

This attack was unexpected, for Mrs. Penniman 
was not used, in any discussion, to seeing the war 
carried into her own country possibly because the 
enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence 
there. To her own consciousness, the flowery fields 
of her reason had rarely been ravaged by a hostile 
force. It was perhaps on this account that in de- 
fending them she was majestic rather than agile. 

" I don't know what you accuse me of, save of 
being too deeply interested in your happiness. It 
is the first time I have been told I am capricious. 
That fault is not what I am usually reproached 
with." 

" You were angry last year that I wouldn't marry 
immediately, and now you talk about my winning 
my father over. You told me it would serve him 
right if he should take me to Europe for nothing. 
Well, he has taken me for nothing, and you ought 
to be satisfied. Nothing is changed nothing but 
my feeling about father. I don't mind nearly so 
much now. I have been as good as I could, but 
he doesn't care. Now I don't care either. I don't 
know whether I have grown bad ; perhaps I have. 
But I don't care for that. I have come home to be 
married that's all I know. That ought to please 
you, unless you have taken up some new idea ; you 
are so strange. You may do as you please, but you 
must never speak to me again about pleading with 
father. I shall never plead with him for anything ; 





that is all over. He has put me off. I am come 
home to be married." 

This was a more authoritative speech than she had 
ever heard on her niece's lips, and Mrs. Penniman 
was proportionately startled. She was, indeed, a lit- 
tle awe -struck, and the force of the girl's emotion 
and resolution left her nothing to reply. She was 
easily frightened, and she always carried off her dis- 
comfiture by a concession a concession which was 
often accompanied, as in the present case, by a little 
nervous laugh. 

XXVI. 

IF she had disturbed her niece's temper she be- 
gan from this moment forward to talk a good deal 
about Catherine's temper, an article which up to 
that time had never been mentioned in connection 
with our heroine Catherine had opportunity on 
the morrow to recover her serenity. Mrs. Penni- 
man had given her a message from Morris Townsend 
to the effect that he would come and welcome her 
home on the day after her arrival. He came in the 
afternoon ; but, as may be imagined, he was not on 
this occasion made free of Doctor Sloper's study. 
He had been coming and going, for the past year, 
so comfortably and irresponsibly, that he had a cer- 
tain sense of being wronged by finding himself re- 
minded that he must now limit his horizon to the 
front parlor, which was Catherine's particular prov- 
ince. 

" I am very glad you have come back," he said ; 
" it makes me very happy to see you again." And 







he looked at her, smiling, from head to foot, though 
it did not appear afterward that he agreed with Mrs. 
Penniman (who, woman-like, went more into details) 
in thinking her embellished. 

To Catherine he appeared resplendent; it was 
some time before she could believe again that this 
beautiful young man was her own exclusive property. 
They had a great deal of characteristic lovers' talk 
a soft exchange of inquiries and assurances. In 
these matters Morris had an excellent grace, which 
flung a picturesque interest even over the account 
of his debut in the commission business a subject 
as to which his companion earnestly questioned him. 
From time to time he got up from the sofa where 
they sat together, and walked about the room ; after 
which he came back, smiling and passing his hand 
through his hair. He was unquiet, as was natural 
in a young man who has just been reunited to a long- 
absent mistress, and Catherine made the reflection 
that she had never seen him so excited. It gave her 
pleasure, somehow, to note this fact. He asked her 
questions about her travels, to some of which she 
was unable to reply, for she had forgotten the names 
of places and the order of her father's journey. But 
for the moment she was so happy, so lifted up by 
the belief that her troubles at last were over, that 
she forgot to be ashamed of her meagre answers. 
It seemed to her now that she could marry him 
without the remnant of a scruple, or a single tremor 
save those that belonged to joy. Without waiting 
for him to ask, she told him that her father had 
come back in exactly the same state of mind that 
he had not yielded an inch. 





" We must not expect it now," she said, " and we 
must do without it." 

Morris sat looking and smiling. " My poor, dear 
girl !" he exclaimed. 

" You mustn't pity me," said Catherine. " I don't 
mind it now; I am used to it." 

Morris continued to smile, and then he got up 
and walked about again. " You had better let me 
try him." 

" Try to bring him over ? You would only make 
him worse," Catherine answered, resolutely. 

" You say that because I managed it so badly be- 
fore. But I should manage it differently now. I 
am much wiser ; I have had a year to think of it. 
I have more tact." 

"Is that what you have been thinking of for a 
year?" 

" Much of the time. You see, the idea sticks in 
my crop. I don't like to be beaten." 

" How are you beaten if we marry ?" 

" Of course I am not beaten on the main issue ; 
but I am, don't you see ? on all the rest of it on 
the question of my reputation, of my relations with 
your father, of my relations with my own children, 
if we should have any." 

" We shall have enough for our children ; we 
shall have enough for everything. Don't you ex- 
pect to succeed in business ?" 

" Brilliantly, and we shall certainly be very com- 
fortable. But it isn't of the mere material comfort 
I speak ; it is of the moral comfort," said Morris 
" of the intellectual satisfaction." 

"I have great moral comfort now," Catherine 
declared, very simply. 





"Of course you have. Bat with me it is differ- 
ent. I have staked my pride on proving to your 
father that he is wrong, and now that I am at the 
head of a flourishing business, I can deal with him 
as an equal. I have a capital plan do let me go at 
him !" 

He stood before her with his bright face, his 
jaunty air, his hands in his pockets ; and she got up, 
with her eyes resting on his own. " Please don't, 
Morris ; please don't," she said ; and there was a 
certain mild, sad firmness in her tone which he 
heard for the first time. " We must ask no favors 
of him we must ask nothing more. He won't re- 
lent, and nothing good will come of it. I know it 
now I have a very good reason." 

" And pray what is your reason ?" 

She hesitated to bring it out, but at last it came. 
" He is not very fond of me." 

" Oh, bother !" cried Morris, angrily. 

" I wouldn't say such a thing without being sure. 
I saw it, I felt it, in England, just before he came 
away. He talked to me one night the last night 
and then it came over me. You can tell when 
a person feels that way. I wouldn't accuse him if 
he hadn't made me feel that way. I don't accuse 
him ; I just tell you that that's how it is. He can't 
help it ; we can't govern our affections. Do I gov- 
ern mine? Mightn't he say that to me? It's be- 
cause he is so fond of my mother, whom we lost so 
long ago. She was beautiful, and very, very brill- 
iant ; he is always thinking of her. I am not at 
all like her ; Aunt Penniman has told me that. Of 
course it isn't my fault ; but neither is it his fault. 





All I mean is, it's true ; and it's a stronger reason 
for his never being reconciled than simply his dis- 
like for you." 

" ' Simply f " cried Morris, with a laugh. " I am 
much obliged for that." 

" I don't mind about his disliking you now ; I 
mind everything less. I feel differently; I feel 
separated from my father." 

" Upon my word," said Morris, " you are a queer 
family." 

"Don't say that don't say anything unkind," 
the girl entreated. " You must be very kind to me 
now, because, Morris, because " and she hesitated 
a moment " because I have done a great deal for 
you." 

" Oh, I know that, my dear." 

She had spoken up to this moment without ve- 
hemence or outward sign of emotion, gently, reason- 
ingly, only trying to explain. But her emotion had 
been ineffectually smothered, and it betrayed itself 
at last in the trembling of her voice. " It is a great 
thing to be separated like that from your father, 
when you have worshipped him before. It has 
made me very unhappy ; or it would have made me 
so if I didn't love you. You can tell when a per- 
son speaks to you as if as if " 

" As if what ?" 

" As if they despised you !" said Catherine, pas- 
sionately. "He spoke that way the night before 
we sailed. It wasn't much, but it was enough, and 
I thought of it on the voyage all the time. Then I 
made up my mind. I will never ask him for any- 
thing again, or expect anything from him. It would 





not be natural now. We must be very happy to- 
gether, and we must not seem to depend upon his 
forgiveness. And, Morris, Morris, you must never 
despise me !" 

This was an easy promise to make, and Morris 
made it with fine effect. But for the moment he 
undertook nothing more onerous. 



CHAPTEK XXVII. 

THE Doctor, of course, on his return, had a good 
deal of talk with his sisters. He was at no great 
pains to narrate his travels or to communicate his 
impressions of distant lands to Mrs. Penniman, upon 
whom he contented himself with bestowing a me- 
mento of his enviable experience in the shape of a 
velvet gown. But he conversed with her at some 
length about matters nearer home, and lost no time 
in assuring her that he was still an inflexible father. 

" I have no doubt you have seen a great deal of 
Mr. Townsend, and done your best to console him 
for Catherine's absence," he said. " I don't ask you, 
and you needn't deny it. I wouldn't put the ques- 
tion to you for the world, and expose you to the in- 
convenience of having to a excogitate an answer. 
No one has betrayed you, and there has been no 
spy upon your proceedings. Elizabeth has told no 
tales, and has never mentioned you except to praise 
your good looks and good spirits. The thing is 
simply an inference of my own an induction, as 
the philosophers say. It seems to me likely that 
you would have offered an asylum to an interesting 





sufferer. Mr. Townsend has been a good deal in 
the house ; there is something in the house that tells 
me so. We doctors, you know, end by acquiring 
fine perceptions, and it is impressed upon my sen- 
sorium that he has sat in these chairs, in a very easy 
attitude, and warmed himself at that fire. I don't 
grudge him the comfort of it ; it is the only one he 
will ever enjoy at my expense. It seems likely, in- 
deed, that I shall be able to economize at his own. 
I don't know what you may have said to him, or 
what you may say hereafter ; but I should like you 
to know that if you have encouraged him to believe 
that he will gain anything by hanging on, or that 
I have budged a hair-breadth from the position I 
took up a year ago, you have played him a trick for 
which he may exact reparation. I'm not sure that 
he may not bring a suit against you. Of course you 
have done it conscientiously ; you have made your- 
self believe that I can be tired out. This is the 
most baseless hallucination that ever visited the 
brain of a genial optimist. I am not in the least 
tired ; I am as fresh as when I started ; I am good 
for fifty years yet. Catherine appears not to have 
budged an inch either; she is equally fresh; so we 
are about where we were before. This, however, 
you know as well as I. What I wish is simply to 
give you notice of my own state of mind. Take it 
to heart, dear Lavinia. Beware of the just resent- 
ment of a deluded fortune-hunter !" 

" I can't say I expected it," said Mrs. Penniman. 
"And I had a sort of foolish hope that you would 
come home without that odious ironical tone with 
which you treat the most sacred subjects." 





" Don't undervalue irony ; it is often of great use. 
It is not, however, always necessary, and I will show 
you how gracefully I can lay it aside. I should like 
to know whether you think Morris Townsend will 
hang on ?" 

"I will answer you with your own weapons," 
said Mrs. Penniman. " You had better wait and 
see." 

"Do you call such a speech as that one of my 
own weapons ? I never said anything so rough." 

" He will hang on long enough to make you very 
uncomfortable, then." 

" My dear Lavinia," exclaimed the Doctor, " do 
you call that irony ? I call it pugilism." 

Mrs. Penniman, however, in spite of her pugilism, 
was a good deal frightened, and she took counsel 
of her fears. Her brother meanwhile took counsel, 
with many reservations, of Mrs. Almond, to whom 
he was no less generous than to Lavinia, and a good 
deal more communicative. 

" I suppose she has had him there all the while," 
he said. " I must look into the state of my wine. 
You needn't mind telling me now ; I have already 
said all I mean to say to her on the subject." 

" I believe he was in the house a good deal," Mrs. 
Almond answered. " But you must admit that your 
leaving Lavinia quite alone was a great change for 
her, and that it was natural she should want some 
society." 

" I do admit that, and that is why I shall make 
no row about the wine ; I shall set it down as com- 
pensation to Lavinia. She is capable of telling me 
that she drank it all herself. Think of the incon- 





ceivable bad taste, in the circumstances, of that fel- 
low making free with the house or coming there 
at all ! If that doesn't describe him, he is indescrib- 
able." 

"His plan is to get what he can. Lavinia will 
have supported him for a year," said Mrs. Almond. 
" It's so much gained." 

" She will have to support him for the rest of his 
life, then," cried the Doctor ; " but without wine, 
as they say at the tables cPhote" 

" Catherine tells me he has set up a business, and 
is making a great deal of money." 

The Doctor stared. " She has not told me that 
and Lavinia didn't deign. Ah !" he cried, " Cath- 
erine has given me up. Not that it matters, for all 
that the business amounts to." 

" She has not given up Mr. Townsend," said Mrs. 
Almond ; " I saw that in the first half-minute. She 
has come home exactly the same." 

" Exactly the same ; not a grain more intelligent. 
She didn't notice a stick or a stone all the while we 
were away not a picture nor a view, not a statue 
nor a cathedral." 

" How could she notice ? She had other things 
to think of ; they are never for an instant out of her 
mind. She touches me very much." 

" She would touch me if she didn't irritate me. 
That's the effect she has upon me now. I have tried 
everything upon her; I really have been quite 
merciless. But it is of no use whatever; she is 
absolutely glued. I have passed, in consequence, 
into the exasperated stage. At first I had a good 
deal of a certain genial curiosity about it ; I wanted 





to see if she really would stick. But, good Lord, 
one's curiosity is satisfied ! I see she is capable of 
it, and now she can let go." 

" She will never let go," said Mrs. Almond. 

" Take care, or you will exasperate me too. If 
she doesn't let go, she will be shaken off sent 
tumbling into the dust. That's a nice position for 
my daughter. She can't see that if you are going 
to be pushed, you had better jump. And then she 
will complain of her bruises." 

" She will never complain," said Mrs. Almond. 

" That I shall object to even more. But the deuce 
will be that I can't prevent anything." 

" If she is to have a fall," said Mrs. Almond, with 
a gentle laugh, " we must spread as many carpets as 
we can." And she carried out this idea by showing 
a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl. 

Mrs. Penniman immediately wrote to Morris 
Townsend. The intimacy between these two was 
by this time consummate, but I must content myself 
with noting but a few of its features. Mrs. Penni- 
man's own share in it was a singular sentiment, 
which might have been misinterpreted, but which 
in itself was not discreditable to the poor lady. It 
was a romantic interest in this attractive and unfort- 
unate young man, and yet it was not such an inter- 
est as Catherine might have been jealous of. Mrs. 
Penniman had not a particle of jealousy of her niece. 
For herself, she felt as if she were Morris's mother 
or sister a mother or sister of an emotional tem- 
perament and she had an absorbing desire to make 
him comfortable and happy. She had striven to do 
so during the year that her brother left her an open 
field, and her efforts had been attended with the 





success that has been pointed out. She had never 
had a child of her own, and Catherine, whom she 
had done her best to invest with the importance that 
would naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had 
only partly rewarded her zeal. Catherine, as an ob- 
ject of affection and solicitude, had never had that 
picturesque charm which (as it seemed to her) would 
have been a natural attribute of her own progeny. 
Even the maternal passion in Mrs. Penniman would 
have been romantic and factitious, and Catherine 
was not constituted to inspire a romantic passion. 
Mrs. Penniman was as fond of her as ever, but she 
had grown to feel that with Catherine she lacked 
opportunity. Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she 
had (though she had not disinherited her niece) 
adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her opportuni- 
ty in abundance. She would have been very happy 
to have a handsome and tyrannical son, and would 
have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs. 
This was the light in which she had come to regard 
Morris, who had conciliated her at first, and made 
his impression by his delicate and calculated defer- 
ence a sort of exhibition to which Mrs. Penniman 
was particularly sensitive. He had largely abated 
his deference afterward, for he economized his re- 
sources, but the impression was made, and the young 
man's very brutality came to have a sort of filial 
value. If Mrs. Penniman had had a son, she would 
probably have been afraid of him, and at this stage 
of our narrative she was certainly afraid of Morris 
Townsend. This was one of the results of his 
domestication in Washington Square. He took his 
ease with her as, for that matter, he would certain- 
ly have done with his own mother. 







CHAPTER XXVIII. 

THE letter was a word of warning; it informed 
him that the Doctor had come home more imprac- 
ticable than ever. She might have reflected that 
Catherine would supply him with all the informa- 
tion he needed on this point ; but we know that 
Mrs. Penniman's reflections were rarely just ; and, 
moreover, she felt that it was not for her to depend 
on what Catherine might do. She was to do her 
duty, quite irrespective of Catherine. I have said 
that her young friend took his ease with her, and it 
is an illustration of the fact that he made no answer 
to her letter. He took note of it amply; but he 
lighted his cigar with it, and he waited, in tranquil 
confidence that he should receive another. "His 
state of mind really freezes my blood," Mrs. Penni- 
man had written, alluding to her brother ; and it 
would have seemed that upon this statement she 
could hardly improve. Nevertheless, she wrote 
again, expressing herself with the aid of a different 
figure. ' " His hatred of you burns with a lurid flame 
the flame that never dies," she wrote. "But it 
doesn't light up the darkness of your future. If 
my affection could do so, all the years of your life 
would be an eternal sunshine. I can extract noth- 
ing from C. ; she is so terribly secretive, like her 
father. She seems to expect to be married very 
soon, and has evidently made preparations in Eu- 





rope quantities of clothing, ten pairs of shoes, etc. 
My dear friend, you cannot set up in married life 
simply with a few pairs of shoes, can you ? Tell 
me what you think of this. I am intensely anxious 
to see you, I have so much to say. I miss you 
dreadfully ; the house seems so empty without you. 
What is the news down town ? Is the business ex- 
tending ? that dear little business : I think it's so 
brave of you! Couldn't I come to your office? 
just for three minutes ? I might pass for a customer 
is that what you call them ? I might come in to 
buy something some shares or some railroad things. 
Tell me what you think ofthisplcvn. I would carry 
a little reticule, like a woman of the people." 

In spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Mor- 
ris appeared to think poorly of the plan, for he gave 
Mrs. Penniman no encouragement whatever to visit 
his office, which he had already represented to her 
as a place peculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find. 
But as she persisted in desiring an interview up to 
the last, after months of intimate colloquy, she called 
these meetings " interviews " he agreed that they 
should take a walk together, and was even kind 
enough to leave his office for this purpose during 
the hours at which business might have been sup- 
posed to be liveliest. It was no surprise to him, 
when they met at a street corner, in a region of 
empty lots and undeveloped pavements (Mrs. Penni- 
man being attired as much as possible like a " wom- 
an of the people "), to find that, in spite of her ur- 
genc} 7 , what she chiefly had to convey to him was 
the assurance of her sympathy. Of such assurances, 
however, he had already a voluminous collection, and 





it would not have been worth his while to forsake a 
fruitful avocation merely to hear Mrs. Penniman say, 
for the thousandth time, that she had made his cause 
her own. Morris had something of his own to say. 
It was not an easy thing to bring out, and while he 
turned it over, the difficulty made him acrimonious. 

" Oh yes, I know perfectly that he combines the 
properties of a lump of ice and a red-hot coal," he 
observed. " Catherine has made it thoroughly clear, 
and you have told me so till I am sick of it. You 
needn't tell rne again ; I am perfectly satisfied. He 
will never give us a penny ; I regard that as mathe- 
matically proved." 

Mrs. Penniman at this point had an inspiration. 

"Couldn't you bring a lawsuit against him?" 
She wondered that this simple expedient had never 
occurred to her before. 

" I will bring a lawsuit against you" said Morris, 
"if you ask me any more such aggravating ques- 
tions. A man should know when he is beaten," he 
added, in a moment. " I must give her up !" 

Mrs. Penniman received this declaration in silence, 
though it made her heart beat a little. It found her 
by no means unprepared, for she had accustomed 
herself to the thought that, if Morris should decided- 
ly not be able to get her brother's money, it would 
not do for him to marry Catherine without it. " It 
would not do," was a vague way of putting the 
thing ; but Mrs. Penniman's natural affection com- 
pleted the idea, which, though it had not as yet been 
so crudely expressed between them as in the form 
that Morris had just given it, had nevertheless been 
implied so often, in certain easy intervals of talk, as 





he sat stretching his legs in the Doctor's well-stuffed 
arm-chairs, that she had grown first to regard it with 
an emotion which she flattered herself was philo- 
sophic, and then to have a secret tenderness for it. 
The fact that she kept her tenderness secret proves, 
of course, that she was ashamed of it ; but she man- 
aged to blink her shame by reminding herself that 
she was, after all, the official protector of her niece's 
marriage. Her logic would scarcely have passed 
muster with the Doctor. In the first place, Morris 
must get the money, and she would help him to it. 
In the second, it was plain it would never come to 
him, and it would be a grievous pity he should mar- 
ry without it a young man who might so easily 
find something better. After her brother had de- 
livered himself, on his return from Europe, of that 
incisive little address that has been quoted, Morris's 
cause seemed so hopeless that Mrs. Penniman fixed 
her attention exclusively upon the latter branch of 
her argument. If Morris had been her son, she 
would certainly have sacrificed Catherine to a supe- 
rior conception of his future ; and to be ready to do 
so, as the case stood, was therefore even a finer de- 
gree of devotion. Nevertheless, it checked her 
breath a little to have the sacrificial knife, as it were, 
suddenly thrust into her hand. 

Morris walked along a moment, and then he re- 
peated, harshly, 

" I must give her up !" 

" I think I understand you," said Mrs. Penniman, 
gently. 

"I certainly, say it distinctly enough brutally 
and vulgarly enough." 





He was ashamed of himself, and his shame was 
uncomfortable ; and as he was extremely intolerant 
of discomfort, he felt vicious and cruel. He wanted 
to abuse somebody, and he began, cautiously for 
he was always cautious with himself. 

" Couldn't you take her down a little ?" he asked. 

" Take her down " 

" Prepare her try and ease me off." 

Mrs. Penniman stopped, looking at him very 
solemnly. 

" My poor Morris, do you know how much she 
loves you ?" 

" No, I don't. I don't want to know. I have al- 
ways tried to keep from knowing. It would be too 
painful." 

" She will suffer much," said Mrs. Penniman. 

"You must console her. If you are as good a 
friend to me as you pretend to be, you will manage 
it." 

Mrs. Penniman shook her head sadly. 

" You talk of my ' pretending ' to like you ; but 
I can't pretend to hate you. I can only tell her I 
think very highly of you ; and how will that console 
her for losing you ?" 

" The Doctor will help you. He will be delight- 
ed at the thing being broken off; and as he is a 
knowing fellow, he will invent something to com- 
fort her." 

" He will invent a new torture," cried Mrs. Pen- 
niman. " Heaven deliver her from her father's 
comfort ! It will consist of his crowing over her, 
and saying, ' I always told you so !' ' : 

Morris colored a most uncomfortable red. 





"If you don't console her any better than you 
console me, you certainly won't be of much use. 
It's a damned disagreeable necessity; I feel it ex- 
tremely, and you ought to make it easy for me." 

" I will be your friend for life," Mrs. Penniman 
declared. 

" Be my friend now!" and Morris walked on. 

She went with him ; she was almost trembling. 

" Should you like me to tell her ?" she asked. 

" You mustn't tell her, but you can you can " 
And he hesitated, trying to think what Mrs. Penni- 
man could do. " You can explain to her why it is. 
It's because I can't bring myself to step in between 
her and her father to give him the pretext he 
grasps at so eagerly (it's a hideous sight !) for de- 
priving her of her rights." 

Mrs. Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude 
the charm of this formula. 

" That's so like you," she said ; " it's so finely 
felt." 

Morris gave his stick an angry swing.
