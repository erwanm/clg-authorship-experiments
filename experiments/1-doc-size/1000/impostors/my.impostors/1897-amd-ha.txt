ANNABEL LEE 

IT was queer up at West Farms, delightful, too. 
The house was old, with a hall through the middle, 
and a Dutch door just as there was up at Yonkers. 
The top part was opened in the morning, some- 
times the whole door. The front room was the 
parlour, and it had not been refurnished since Mrs. 
Odell came there as a bride ; so it looked rather 
antiquated to modern eyes. The back room was 
the sleeping chamber; on the other side, a living 
room with rag carpet on the floor ; then a kitchen 
and a great shed-kitchen, one side of which was 
piled up with wood. There was a big back stoop 
that looked on the vegetable garden ; there was 
an orchard down below, and then cornfields and 
meadows. 

The old house was what was called a story and 
a half. The pointed roof had windows in the end, 
but none in the front. There were two nice big 
chambers upstairs, and a garret. Mr. Odell began 
to talk about building a new house ; and Mrs. Odell 
said the things by which she meant the carpets 
and furniture - - were good enough for the old 
place, but they 'd have all new by the time the 
girls grew up, to fit the new house. 



 

Mr. Odell had a peach-orchard and a quince- 
orchard, and two long rows of cherry-trees. Then 
he kept quite a herd of cows, and sold milk. He 
had a splendid new barn, with two finished rooms 
in that, where the hands slept in summer. The 
old barn was devoted to the hay and the horses. 
There were chickens and ducks and geese, and a 
pen of pigs. This summer, they were raising three 
pretty calves and one little colt, who was desperately 
shy. But the calves would come up to be patted, 
and eat out of your hand. 

Both of the girls were what their mother called 
regular tomboys. Polly was a few months older 
than the little girl, and Janey two years her senior. 
They were smart too. They could wash dishes 
and make beds and sweep, weed in the garden, 
look after the poultry; and Janey could iron almost 
as well as her mother. But they did love to run 
and whoop, and tumble in the hay, and they laughed 
over almost everything. They were not great stu- 
dents, though they went to school regularly. 

A second or third cousin lived with the Odells, 
and did a great deal of the housework. She was 
not " real bright," and had some queer ways. Her 
immediate relatives were dead ; and the Odells had 
taken her from a feeling of pity, and a fear lest at 
last she would be sent to the poor-house. She 
had an odd way of talking incoherently to herself, 
and nodding her head at almost everything ; yet 
she was good-tempered and always ready to do as 
she was told. But the worst was her lack of 
memory; you had to tell her the same things 



everyday, "get her started in the traces," Mr. 
Odell said. 

Mrs. Odell put a cot in the girls' room for 
Hanny, since there was plenty of space. And 
Polly seemed to find so many funny stories to tell 
over that Hanny fell asleep in the midst of them, 
and woke up in the morning without a bit of home- 
sick feeling. Then Mr. Odell was going to the 
mill, and he took Polly and Hanny along, and they 
had a rather amusing time. 

Hanny was very much interested in the process, 
and amazed when she found how they made the 
different things out of the same wheat. They 
used "middlings' 1 for pancakes at home, w r hen 
her mother was tired of buckwheat. Not to have 
had griddle-cakes for breakfast would have been 
one of the hardest trials of life for men and boys 
through the winter. It warmed them up of a cold 
morning, and they seemed to thrive on it. 

Mr. Odell was very willing to explain the pro- 
cesses to Hanny. Polly wanted to know if she 
thought of going into the milling business, and 
suggested that she never would be big enough. 
Then they ran round to look at the water-wheel and 
the little pond where the stream was dammed so 
there would be no lack of water in a dry time. 

They had a drawing pattern in school just like 
it, except that it lacked the broken rustic bridge a 
little higher up. She would take a new interest in 
drawing it now r . 

It was noon when they reached home, and 
Hanny felt real hungry, though Mrs. Odell de- 

" 

clared she didn't eat more than a bird. She was 
glad her girls were not such delicate little things. 

They went out on the shady back stoop after- 
ward. Janey was sewing the over-seam in a sheet 
that her mother wanted turned. When she had 
finished, and picked out the old sewing, she was 
free. Then she said they would go down to the 
Bristows' and have a good game of hide and seek. 
They always had such fun at the Bristows.' 

Polly brought out her basket of carpet-rags, a 
peach basket nearly full. 

" I just hate to sew carpet-rags ! ' she declared. 

" Couldn't I help you ? ' asked Hanny. 

" Why, to be sure you could, if you would, and 
knew how to sew." 

" Of course I know how to sew," said Hanny, 
rather affronted. 

" Oh, I was only in fun ! I 'll find you a thim- 
ble. It 's in my work-box that was given me on 
Christmas. It 's real silver, too. Mother 's going 
to change it when she goes to New York, only she 
never remembers. My fingers are so fat. Oh, 
Hanny, what a little mite of a hand ! It 'll never 
be good for anything." 

" I have made a whole shirt myself, and I have 
hemstitched, and done embroidery, and I wipe 
dishes when I haven't too many lessons," inter- 
posed the little girl. 

" You can't make your own frocks," in a tone of 
triumph. 

" No. Miss Cynthia Blackfan comes and does 
it. Can you? ' 



"No, she can't," said Janey, while Polly threw 
her head back and laughed, showing her strong 
white teeth. " And she could no more make 
a shirt than she could fly. You 're real smart, 
Hanny. I 'm two years older, and I 've never made 
a whole one. I 'm going to try though, and 
father 's promised me a dollar when I do it all by 
myself." 

Polly had found the thimble. It wasn't any 
prettier than Hanny's, though Polly begged her " to 
be real careful and not lose it." 

" Now you can just sew hit or miss ; and then 
you can put in a long strip of black, 'cause there 's 
more black than anything else. Oh, dear, I do 
hate to sew rags ! ' 

"What kind of sewing do you like?' asked 
Janey, in a tone that would have been sarcastic in 
an older person. 

" I just don't like any kind. Hanny, do you 
know that some one has invented a sewing-ma- 
chine?' and Polly looked up with the triumph of 
superior wisdom. 

" Oh, yes, I saw it at the Institute Fair. And 
there 's a place on Broadway where a woman sits 
in the window and sews. It 's very queer ; but we 
think it doesn't sew real nice." 

Polly was for the moment nonplussed. Hanny 
did seem to know almost everything. Then curi- 
osity overcame her. 

"Does it do really and truly sewing?" 

" Why, yes. When you come down, I 'll ask Joe 
to take us over to see it." 

 

" Carpet-rags? ' 

"Well- -I don't know. Long straight seams, 
and hems and stitching." 

" Well, I 'm going to have one when I 'm mar- 
ried. I wonder if they cost very much ! ' 

" There 'll be lots of things for you to do be- 
fore you are married. And some girls don't have 
any chance. You 'll want to know how to keep 
house ' 

" I like housekeeping. You just go from one 
thing to another. I 'll have some one to cook and 
peel potatoes and all that. And we 'll keep a horse 
and waggon, and I shall go to ride every day." 

Janey laughed. " Just now, you had better sew 
carpet-rags." 

" And I 'll never have any rag carpets. I will 
give away all the old clothes." 

" I 'm afraid you 'll never have much of any- 
thing, nor a husband either, Polly Odell," said 
her mother. " You talk, and leave the rags for 
Hanny to sew." 

Polly turned scarlet, and sewed very indus- 
triously. 

" I 'd like to see a sewing-machine," began Janey, 
presently. "How does it go?' 

" There is a strap around a wheel that is fast to 
a frame. You put your feet on, so, and just make 
them go up and down after you have started the 
wheel with your hand. The needle goes through, 
and something catches the thread, then it goes 
through again, and that makes the stitch. It is 
very curious." 



" You know a good many things, don't you, 
Hanny? ' said Janey, admiringly. 

Hanny coloured. 

" I can beat her all out running, I know; and 
I 'll bet a penny she can't jump over the creek." 

" And don't you dare her to, Polly. Remember 
how you fell in. Oh, Hanny, she was a sight to 
behold!" 

" Well - - it had been raining, and the ground was 
soft, so I slipped a little on the start. But I 've 



done it time and again." 

" And you 're a regular tomboy. Girls don't 
train around that way in the city." 

Janey had begun to rip out the old seam. She 
sighed a little, and wished she was sewing carpet- 
rags. That was such easy work. 

" Hanny sews a great deal faster than you," she 
said to Polly. " See what a pile she has. I will 
wind them up." 

It made quite a ball, and was a little rest from 
the ripping, that sounded so easy and yet was 
tedious. But Janey persevered, and finally, after 
turning about a time or two, came to the middle 
with a sigh of relief. Polly had been working like 
a steam-engine for ten minutes, and picked out a 
good many long pieces, so she had a ball as large 
as Hanny's. 

Then they put on their sun-bonnets, and ran 
down to the Bristows', which was in the turn of the 
road. There were three girls, one of nine who 
was almost as big as Hanny, and the one of eleven, 
much taller. 


They all had a good drink of buttermilk : Mrs. 
Bristow had just been churning. Then they went 
out to the barn and played " hide-and-seek," and 
had a noisy, jolly time. They sat down and fanned 
themselves with their aprons, and presently started 
out for some blackberries. 

" There 's a German settlement down below, and 
the children are up here every day picking berries. 
You can't have anything now, unless it is planted 
in your own garden. We have some lovely big 
blackberries, when they get ripe." 

Then the girls ran a race. Hanny was out of 
breath presently, and stopped, so did little Kitty 
Bristow. But Julie Bristow beat in the race. Polly 
wanted to run again ; but the others were tired. 

Mrs. Bristow gave Janey a beautiful, big pot- 
cheese to take home; and it was just delicious. 

One of the cousins from Fordham had been 
down. The children were all to come up and 
spend the day to-morrow, and Mrs. Odell was 
invited to supper. 

Hanny felt a little lonely. If she could just 
see her father and Joe, and her mother and the 
boys. But she slept very soundly ; and truly she 
wasn't homesick when they all came to breakfast 
in the morning. Janey hurried around and did her 
work, and they were soon ready to be off. A day 
meant all day, then. 

It was a pretty country walk, with here and there 
a house, and one little nest of Irish emigrants. 
Some of the women had their wash-tubs out of 
doors, and were working and gossiping. Then 





there was St. John's College, with its pretty, shady 
grounds, and on the other side a hotel where the 
trains stopped as they went up and down. After 
that, you climbed a long hill that wound a little, 
and on one side there was a row of beautiful, stately 
cherry-trees that were a sight to behold in their 
early bloom and in the rich harvest of fruiting. 

Just at the brow of the hill stood a rather quaint 
house, with the end to the street. It was built 
against the side of the hill. You ascended a row 
of stone steps, and reached the lower floor, which 
was a dining-room with a wide stone-paved area, 
then you went up several more steps to a cheer- 
ful sunny room, and this was the kitchen. When 
you went upstairs again, one side of the house 
was just even with the ground, and the other up a 
whole story. Here was a parlour, a sitting-room, 
several sleeping chambers ; but what the little girl 
came to love most of all was a great piazza built 
over the area downstairs, with a row of wide steps. 
When you were up there, you were two stories 
above the street, and you could look down the long 
hill and all about. It was a beautiful prospect. 
Afterward, the little girl found some chalets in 
Switzerland that made her think of this odd house 
that had been added to since the first cottage 
was built. 

There was always a host of people in the old 
house. Hospitality must have been written on its 
very gates, for relatives, unto the third and fourth 
generation, were continually made welcome: a 
sweet, placid grandmother who had seen herdaugh- 




i 

ter, the housemother, laid away to her silent rest- 
ing-place, and who had tried to supply her place 
to the children; the father; the aunt who took part 
of the care ; the sons and daughters, some of whom 
had grown up and married, and whose children 
made glad the old home. 

There was a houseful of them now; but there 
was a wide out-of-doors for them to play in. A 
few hundred feet farther up, where the road turned 
and ran off to Kingsbridge, as well as to the Harlem 
River, stood the village smithy ; and the Major, who 
had been in the War of 1812, had relegated the 
business mostly to his sons. He enjoyed the com- 
ing and going, the bright young faces, and had a 
hearty welcome for the children, though he some- 
times pretended to scold them. 

A queer tract of land it was, with a great rift of 
rock running through it where the children played 
house, and had parties, and occasionally took their 
dinner out to eat in picnic fashion. Just beyond 
the strata of rock, on the good ground, stood two 
splendid apple-trees called " Jersey Sweetings," 
and for nearly two summer months their bounty 
was the delight of the children. Farther down, the 
ground sloped abruptly and settled into a pleasant 
orchard ; then another sudden decline, and here a 
pretty stream came purling through, making a tiny 
cascade as it tumbled over the rocks. 

The little girl was deeply touched by beauty; 
and as they ran around she stopped now and then 
to drink in the shady vistas and wild nooks that 
seemed fairy-haunted. She had been reading a 



little mythology, and she could believe in a great 
many things. There were places where she looked 
to see Pan piping on his reed, and dryads and 
nymphs coming out of the groves. 

How they did run and play ! The air was merry 
with shouts and laughter. Some of them took off 
their shoes and stockings, and waded in the brook. 
And one of the big boys proposed that on Satur- 
day afternoon they should go down to the Harlem 
River and get some crabs and clams. 

There were enough children for a second table, 
and that was laid in the upper kitchen. Auntie 
thought they must be starved ; but instead they 
had been stuffed with sweet apples. Still most of 
them did justice to the bountiful dinner. 

" This little girl looks tired out," said grand- 
mother. " I think she had better stay in and rest 
a while." 

Hanny was very glad to do this. While grand- 
mother took her nap, she went upstairs where the 
grown-up people were talking and sewing. She 
wished she had brought her crocheting; but Polly 
had laughed her out of it. Then she took up a 
book, and was soon lost in that. It was an English 
novel, as most of our novels were then, " Time the 
Avenger." 

" That is a rather sad book for a little girl," said 
Cousin Jennie. " I 'll see if I can't find you some- 
thing better. You look as if you were fond of 
reading. You are Vermilye Underbill's little girl. 
And your brother George has gone to California. 
I know him quite well, and the Yonkers family. 

 

I suppose he hasn't found his nugget of gold 
yet?" 

The little girl smiled, and said she did not think 
he had yet. His letters had been full of the won- 
derful country; and it took so long to get a letter. 

" Here are some magazines with pictures and 
verses. Are you fond of poetry? Maybe you are 
a poet. You have a delicate, ethereal look." 

" Do poets have that?' asked Hanny. "I 
know a girl who writes verses and stories ; but she 
isn't at all ethereal. I 'm quite sure I couldn't 
write verses or anything," and she gave a soft 
laugh. 

" Well, I think geniuses look quite like other 
people. I 've seen a number of them lately. We 
have a genius living up the road, and ever so many 
people come to see him. Some quite famous 
ladies." 

Hanny opened her eyes very wide. 

" Let me see I think I can find one of his 
poems." She took a pile of magazines from the 
top of the high old-fashioned bureau. " Oh, yes, 
though, like ' Time the Avenger,' I think it 's too 
old for you. I 'm not very fond of poetry. Here is 
'Annabel Lee.'" 

Then Cousin Jennie was called into the other 
room, where some one wanted to talk about the 
best way to ruffle a lawn skirt. Should the ruffles 
be on the straight or bias? 

Hanny read the verses over and over, and saw 
the city by the sea where dwelt beautiful Annabel 
Lee, and how her high-born kinsman, who came in 



great state in a chariot, carried her away from the 
one who loved her so dearly. But when, later on, 
she came to know and understand the poem, and 
the high-born kinsman had come for some of 
those she held most dear, she could always go 
back to the vague mysterious awe that filled and 
thrilled her then. She sat as if in a trance until 
grandmother, who had taken her nap, came and 
took the arm-chair beside the open window. 

"Well, are you rested?' said grandmother, 
cheerfully. " I should think Janey and Polly would 
wear you out. It isn't a good thing for little girls 
to run too much. But everything has changed 
since my day. Although I think they ran and 
played then ; but they had to help work, there 
was so much out-of-doors work. Everything is 
easier now. There are so many improvements. 
And, oh, how much there is to read ! I 'm not 
sure that is so good for them." 

" But it is very delightful," returned the little girl. 

" If it only made people wiser ! ' 

*' But they are growing curiously wise," said 
Hanny. " There is the telegraph. It seemed so 
queer that you could make a bit of wire talk, that 
at first people didn't believe it. Uncle Paid did 
not when he saw it at the Fair." 

" And people laughed about the steamboat, I 
remember, and the idea of railroad trains drawn 
by an engine. Yes, there are a good many strange 
things. And steamships crossing the ocean. 
There used to be sailing-vessels, and it took such 



a long while.' 



;  

Hanny told grandmother about her friend who 
had gone abroad ; and grandmother, in return, told 
her about some Welsh ancestors who had to fly for 
their lives on account of being mixed up with some 
insurrection about a young prince, and the stormy 
time they had coming over,- -how they were driven 
up and down the coast, and their voyage consumed 
two months. They were almost out of provisions, 
and suffered many hardships. So the wisdom of 
the world had amounted to something. 

The children came in. They were going up the 
road, and didn't Hanny want to join them? Mrs. 
Odell said they must not stay very long, she was 
going home before supper. 

There was a protest about this ; but Mrs. Odell 
said there were people and children enough with- 
out them, and she had told her husband they 
would be home to supper. 

" Do we go by the poet's house? " Hanny asked 
as they passed the cross-road. 

"The poet?' Two or three of the children 
stared blankly. 

" Oh, Hanny means that Mr. Poe. Why, yes; 
it's the old Cromwell house. It isn't much to 
see. There, that little cottage." 

No, it was not much to see, - - a very bird's nest 
house with a great tree shading it, and a little 
porch at the side. A rather thin elderly woman 
sat sewing in a rocking-chair. She did not even 
look up at the children. 

They were full of fun and nonsense, and pres- 
ently were joined by two neighbouring girls. They 



went up by the old church, and then they wan- 
dered to the graveyard. It was a rather neglected 
place, as country graveyards were wont to be at 
that time. Some red clovers were in bloom, and 
a few belated buttercups. The trees were rather 
straggling, a few magnificent in their age. There 
were long-armed rose-trees that had done their 
best in the earlier season, a few wild roses, pale 
from growing in the shade, and the long slender 
blades of grass fell about in very weakness. There 
were some curious inscriptions ; there were places 
where relatives of several of the children were 
buried. 

"Oh, Hanny, come here," said Cousin Ann. 
" That Mr. Poe's wife is buried here. It 's the 
Valentine plot. They 're going to take her away 
sometime. They 're all very poor, you know. She 
died in the winter. People said she was beauti- 
ful ; but," Ann lowered her voice, - - " they were 
awful poor, and it is said she didn't have comfort- 
able things. I should hate to be so poor; shouldn't 
you?" 

Hanny shuddered. She was glad to get out in 
the sunshine again with her few wild flowers in her 
hand. 

Bessie Valentine made them come in and have a 
chunk of cake, and it was a chunk indeed. Those 
who liked had a glass of buttermilk. 

Cousin Jennie had gone up to the corner to look 
for them. Hanny espied her, and ran forward. 

" Oh," she cried, " I 've seen the house where 
Mr. Poe lives. And we went in the grave- 





yard. Who was the other lady sitting on the 
porch?" 

" That was Mrs. Clemm. I go up there to 
borrow books ; and I like Mr. Foe, only - - well, he 
is rather unfortunate." 

"Was she so beautiful? " asked the child, irrele- 
vantly. 

"Mrs. Poe? Yes; I think she must have been. 
She looked like a small white wraith - - do you 
know what a wraith is? " smilingly. 

" A kind of ghost. And were they very poor? ' 

" It 's a sad story. I think they were proud as 
well, for any one would have come in and done 
any needed thing. They had friends in the city 
who used to visit them. Mrs. Clemm was Mrs. 
Foe's mother and the poet's aunt; and it is said 
Annabel Lee means his wife. It 's a wild, musical 
thing. Every story or poem of his has a curious 
ghostly sound." 

"But- -the high-born kinsman - 

The little girl's eyes were vague and puzzled. 

" You can't understand it. Poets say queer 
things. I 'm not fond of poetry, only here and 
there. And the stories make you shiver. You 
wouldn't like them. He has all sorts of books, and 
he is very generous with them. We 've planned 
that you are to come up and stay a week with us. 
Some of the folks are going away, and there will 
be plenty of room." 

Hanny squeezed her hand. The throng of chil- 
dren ran over the grassy path from the shop ; and 
they all began to clamour that Polly and Janey 


should come up Saturday and go crabbing with 
them. 

Mrs. Odell said she 'd see, if they could get their 
work done in time. 

There was a hubbub of good-byes, and the small 
cavalcade started down the road. 



' 



CHAPTER X 

WITH A POET 

THE city by the sea sung itself in Hanny's brain. 
The sweet, young, beautiful wife, ruthlessly torn 
away, was somewhere in space, among the stars 
perhaps, and not in the old graveyard. She was 
floating on and on amidst all lovely things and 
divine fragrances. She could never grow old ; she 
would never want for anything. Ah, would she 
not want for the mother and the poet who loved 
her? 

An incident that had moved her strongly only a 
few weeks before, was a strange bit of reminiscence 
that could hardly be called a story. Ben had 
brought home a volume of De Otiincey, and 
* Suspiria de Profundis ' was among the papers. 
The others were too intellectual to interest her; 
but the touching, tender, immeasurable longing 
for the little sister gone out of life, filled her in- 
most soul with an emotion so sacred she could not 
talk it over with any one. This was akin to it. 

Yet Hanny did not live in the clouds or in 
vague memories all the time. Her father drove 
up the next day, and found she was not homesick ; 
and her mother was coming up the next week to 
spend the day ; and everybody was well. She had 



a great deal to tell him ; and she seemed very 
merry. He wasn't quite sure about the crabbing 
expedition ; but Mrs. Odell said there wasn't a 
mite of danger, for some of the big boys always 
went along ; and that it was a regular frolic for the 
children. 

So Saturday they put on their oldest clothes. 
Hanny wore an outgrown frock of Polly's. Mr. 
Odell said he would drive them down to the river, 
which would save half the walk. He had some 
business in that direction. 

He had the farm-waggon, and put some hay in 
the bottom, though he insisted Hanny should sit 
on the seat with him. They stopped at Fordham, 
and took in another relay; and the children were 
wild with the unreasoning gladness of youth. Mr. 
Odell was in an uncommon good-humour, and 
took them down the river quite a distance, to High 
Bridge, and then up again, when they espied the 
boys and baskets and the net, which had a long 
handle and looked to Hanny like a butterfly-net, 
only larger. 

A motley crew they were. The boys had their 
trousers rolled above their knees, and some of the 
girls took off their shoes and stockings and waded 
about in the wet, sedgy grass. There was a little 
dock where the boats were tied ; and soon two of 
them were loosened and filled up with a jolly crew. 
Big, cheerful Cousin Ben took charge of the little 
girl, and would not allow the others to frighten 
her. Ann was quite a famous hand on these 
expeditions. 

 

They rowed out a short distance, and then began 
business. Oh, the shrieks and laughter that came 
from the other boat, when some one dipped up 
two hands full of water and dashed it over the 
others. And it is strange how much you can 
make your hands hold at such a time. Hanny 
was glad she was not in that boat, when they rocked 
it up and down. But most of the children could 
swim, and they were not in the channel. 

" Quick ! ' exclaimed Cousin Ann, and the net 
was held out in a twinkling. Ann drew up a great 
green fellow with a frightful lot of legs, and he 
dropped in the net. They dumped him into a 
basket, and covered him with a piece of old fish- 
net ; and the more he struggled to get out, the 
more he entangled himself. Hanny felt rather 
glad he was not down her end of the boat. 

They had brilliant luck for a little while. Then 
the other boat shifted about ; they had not caught 
a single crab, and there were loud murmurs of dis- 
content. The others had the best place. 

" You make such a racket you frighten them 
away," said Ben. 

" Can they hear? ' asked Hanny. 

" I think about everything in this world can see 
and hear in some fashion." 

They certainly were dreadful looking. The 
laughter and the exclamations, the disappointment 
at losing one, the funny conundrums the children 
propounded to one another, and the limp appear- 
ance of the voyagers, partly made amends for the 
sudden fright every time the great sprawling things 



came up. Hanny would not even undertake the 
capture of one. 

The crabs grew wise presently. Not one of 
them could be aroused to the faintest curiosity 
concerning bait. Ben's boat had nineteen, the 
other eleven. They rowed up to the little dock, 
and managed to get them all in one basket. Jack 
showed Hanny how you could take hold of a crab, 
and render him helpless. It certainly did look 
funny to see him struggling with all his might and 
main, and his numerous legs. The two front ones 
were very fierce. 

" He could give you an awful pinch with them," 
said Jack ; and he made believe fling him at a 
group of girls, who scattered pellmell. 

" I suppose the legs are oars, and help him swim," 
said Hanny. 

" And help him grab his prey. He 's a sort of 
savage fellow, and lives on smaller folks." 

Then Ben and Jack went to dig for clams. 
There were very nice clam and oyster beds along 
the river then. There were not many people to 
disturb them, and no sewage to starve them out. 

Hanny thought planting oysters a very funny 
idea. They were put in their beds like other 
babies. 

The boys, and some of the girls, picked up the 
clams, until they had a half-bushel basket full. 
Tony Creese, the black man who did odd jobs, was 
to drive down for the " freight; ' but he seemed in 
no hurry. Some of the boys went in swimming; 
and Janey Odcll did wish she had brought another 

 

frock along. She could swim very well. They 
waded instead. Ben walked up to a little bank 
that, having lain in the sun all day, was warm and 
dry, and stretched himself out. Ann was too big 
to go 'Marking" about with the girls, so she and 
Hanny, and one or two others, sat down on the 
soft, sunburned turf. 

How beautiful it all was ! The sun was going 
down behind the New Jersey hills. The little rise 
of ground between this and the Hudson shut out 
the river ; but it could not shut out the amethystine 
splendour. Back of it all was heaven, to the child's 
faith. Miss Lois and her sister were there, and 
old Mr. Bounett, and the poet's young wife, and 
ever so many others. It was only the other side 
of the clouds, with their scarlet and gold and green 
battlements. She could see the ships sailing into 
port. She recalled " Pilgrim's Progress," and 
Christiana going across. In that moment of 
ecstasy she could have gone herself. 

Tony came down the road singing " Oh, Susan- 
nah ; ' Ben answered " Hillo ! ' and shook himself 
like a great bear. The two baskets were put into 
the waggon. 

" Now you girls who are too delicate for a long 
walk, or too much worn out by your day's toil, 
had better hop in. Ann, you go and keep an eye 
on Hanny. Now who else ? ' 

They were all pretty tired with their racing 
about, and the three smallest ones were picked 
out, as there was but one horse. The others formed 
the rear-guard, and marched on behind, with their 



arms about each other. They were too tired for 
even the tempting game of " tag," or the ambition 
of running races. 

Mr. Odell was waiting at the uncle's, having 
come around the other way. Supper was ready ; 
but he thought they had better be " gettin' on," as 
mother would wait supper for them. 

Hanny was very tired, and went to bed immedi- 
ately after the meal. 

They had some splendid clam-fritters for break- 
fast. Ben had proposed to divide the crabs ; but 
Mr. Odell reckoned, "He'd go crabbing the first 
leisure day," and was satisfied with part of the 
clams. 

And then, unexpected delight, Stephen and 
Dolly and the two babies came up to dinner. 
Little Stevie captured everybody, he was so merry 
and cunning ; and Polly wished they could keep him. 

" When he gets to be a big boy, and has a school 
vacation, I 'll be very glad to send him up, I dare 
say," was the response. 

"But, dear me, we'll be big too," said Polly; 
" and it won't be any fun." 

Dolly told her little sister-in-law all the news, 
and what everybody was doing. It seemed as if 
she had been away so long. Mother had spent a 
day with Martha, which she had been promising 
to do ever since Martha was married. 

The little girl almost wanted to go home with 
them ; but no one invited her, and she would not 
have been so silly or ungracious as to plead home- 
sickness, for she really wasn't homesick a bit. 



Then, on Tuesday, Joe came up with a letter 
from Daisy, who had gone to some German baths, 
and was drinking water twice as horrid as that at 
Saratoga. The things you had to eat were so very 
queer ; but the music everywhere was perfectly be- 
witching. Everything was so different. She was 
taking lessons of a Fraulein, and had to talk Ger- 
man at the table. They had been through several 
churches, and one picture gallery that was magnifi- 
cent. A little withered-up old German was giving 
her some painting lessons. If Hanny could only 
be there, she would be quite content; yet she did 
think she loved America best. 

Hanny was so delighted that her eyes shone, 
and her cheeks were pink as a rose-leaf. 

But Mrs. Odell said she could notice that her 
appetite was better, and she was doing her best to 
fat her up a little, and make her look like a country 
girl. 

Mr. Odell took her about with him when he 
could. There were so many beautiful places up 
and down the valley of the Bronx. They went up 
to White Plains, and took everybody by surprise. 
Grandmother up there was quite feeble now. 

Then it happened, rather oddly, that when Cousin 
Jennie came down for her, as there was no one 
scarcely at Fordham but the regular family, Mrs. 
Odell was going to have a houseful of relatives 
from the West. She just wished they had their 
new house at such times as these. She could make 
a bed on the floor for Janey and Polly, and that 
would give her two spare rooms. 



The girls didn't feel so badly, as there were two 
Western cousins of their age, and they would bring 
them up to Fordham. 

The little girl was not at all tired of her pleasant 
hosts; but there was a romantic side to the coming 
visit that she could not talk over with Polly and 
Janey ; and she was most famished for reading, as 
the Odells were not of the intellectual sort. Mrs. 
Odell didn't like the children to handle her 
parlour books, in their red morocco bindings, 
that were spread around on the centre-table. 

Hanny's favourite place at the Fordham house 
was up on the high piazza. To be sure, it was 
sunny in the morning; but then Doctor Joe said 
sunshine was good for her, and one corner soon 
grew shady. There was some one passing up and 
down continually : the priests from St. John's Col- 
lege, in their long black coats and queer hats, gen- 
erally reading as they walked ; the labourers who 
worked on the railroad ; the people going to the 
station ; and the girls out calling in the afternoons 
in their pretty white gowns. There was no Jerome 
Park for stylish driving. Indeed, it was a plain 
little country village, and most of the life centred 
about the corner grocery and the blacksmith shop, 
where men talked politics and the discovery of 
California, and discussed the merits of the heroes 
of the Mexican War. 

She sewed some patchwork for Cousin Jennie, 
who was making several bed-quilts, and who had a 
lover,- - a tall, bright-eyed young man who drove 
a very handsome horse. Hanny felt quite wise 





on the subject of lovers ; and though no one said 
anything special, she understood what the prepara- 
tions meant. 

" Now," Cousin Jennie said the next afternoon,
