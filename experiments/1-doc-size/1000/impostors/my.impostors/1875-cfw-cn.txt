" The things will be coming ashore, the things will 
be coming ashore," muttered the old man, his anx- 
ious eyes turned towards the water that lay on a 
level with his face; he could not raise himself now. 
"Do you see things coming ashore?" 

Waring looked searchingly at him. "Tell me the 
truth," he said, "has the girl no boat?" 

" No." 

" Will any one go to rescue her ; does any one know 
of the castle ? " 

"Not a human being on this earth." 

" And that aunt, that Jacob ? " 

" Didn't you guess it ? They are both dead. I 
rowed them out by night and buried them, my 



 

poor old sister, and the boy who had been our serv- 
ing-lad. The child knows nothing of death. I told 
her they had gone away." 

"Is there no way for her to cross to the islands or 
mainland ? " 

" No ; there is a circle of deep water all around the 
castle, outside." 

" I see nothing for it, then, but to try and save your 
justly forfeited life," said Waring, kneeling down with 
an expression of repugnance. He was something of a 
surgeon, and knew what he was about. His task over, 
he made up the fire, warmed some food, fed the old 
man, and helped his waning strength with the contents 
of his flask. "At least you placed all my property in 
the dug-out before you set me adrift," he said; "may 
I ask your motive ? " 

" I did not wish to harm you ; only to get rid of 
you. You had provisions, and your chances were as 
good as many you had had in the woods." 

"But I might have found my way back to your 
castle ? " 

" Once outside, you could never do that," replied the 
old man, securely. 

" I could go back along-shore." 

"There are miles of piny- wood swamps where the 
streams come down ; no, you could not do it, unless 
you went away round to Lake Superior again, and 
struck across the country as you did before. That 



 

would take you a month or two, and the summer is 
almost over. You would not risk a Northern snow- 
storm, I reckon. But say, do you see things coming 
ashore ? " 

" The poor bodies will come, no doubt," said Waring, 
sternly. 

"Not yet; and they don't often come in here, any 
way; they're more likely to drift out to sea." 

" Miserable creature, this is not the first time, then ! " 

" Only four times, only four times in fifteen long 
years, and then only when she was close to starvation," 
pleaded the old man. "The steamer was honestly 
wrecked, the Anchor, of the Buffalo line, hon- 
estly, I do assure you ; and what I gathered from her 
she did not go to pieces for days lasted me a 
long time, besides furnishing the castle. It was a god- 
send to me, that steamer. You must not judge me, 
boy;, I work, I slave, I go hungry and cold, to keep 
her happy and warm. But times come when every- 
thing fails and starvation is at the door. She never 
knows it, none of them ever knew it, for I keep the 
keys and amuse them with little mysteries; but, as 
God is my judge, the wolf has been at the door, and 
is there this moment unless I have luck. Fish? 
There are none in shore where they can catch them. 
Why do I not fish for them ? I do ; but my darling 
is not accustomed to coarse fare, her delicate life 
must be delicately nourished. O, you do not know, 



 

you do not know ! I am growing old, and my hands 
and eyes are not what they were. That very night 
when I came home and found you there, I had just 
lost overboard my last supplies, stored so long, hus- 
banded so carefully ! If I could walk, I would show 
you my cellar and storehouse back in the woods. 
Many things that they have held were honestly 
earned, by my fish and my game, and one thing and 
another. I get out timber and raft it down to the 
islands sometimes, although the work is too hard for 
an old man alone; and I trade my furs off regularly 
at the settlements on the islands and even along the 
mainland, a month's work for a little flour or sugar. 
Ah, how I have labored ! I have felt my muscles 
crack, I have dropped like a log from sheer weaririess. 
Talk of tortures ; which of them have I not felt, with 
the pains and faintness of exposure and hunger rack- 
ing me from head to foot? Have I stopped for snow 
and ice? Have I stopped for anguish? Never; I 
have worked, worked, worked, with the tears of pain 
rolling down my cheeks, with my body gnawed by 
hunger. That night, in some way, the boxes slipped 
and fell overboard as I was shifting them ; just slipped 
out of my grasp as if on purpose, they knowing all 
the time that they were my last. Home I came, 
empty-handed, and found you there ! I would have 
taken your supplies, over on the north beach, that 
night, yes, without pity, had I not felt sure of those 



 

last boxes ; but I never rob needlessly. You look at 
me with scorn ? You are thinking of those dead men ? 
But what are they to Silver, the rough common 
fellows, and the wolf standing at the castle door ! 
Believe me, though, I try everything before I resort 
to this, and only twice out of the four times have 
I caught anything with my tree-hung light; once it 
was a vessel loaded with provisions, and once it was 
a schooner with grain from Chicago, which washed 
overboard and was worthless. O, the bitter day 
when I stood here in the biting wind and watched 
it float by out to sea ! But say, has anything come 
ashore ? She will be waking soon, and we have miles 
to go." 

But Waring did not answer ; he turned away. The 
old man caught at his feet. "You are not going," he 
cried in a shrill voice, " you are not going ? Leave 
me to die, that is well ; the sun will come and burn 
me, thirst will come and madden me, these wounds 
will torture me, and all is no more than I deserve. 
But Silver ? If I die, she dies. If you forsake me, 
you forsake her. Listen; do you believe in your 
Christ, the dear Christ? Then, in his name I swear 
to you that you cannot reach her alone, that only I 
can guide you to her. save me, for her sake ! Must 
she suffer and linger and die ? God, have pity and 
soften his heart ! " The voice died away in sobs, the 
weak slow sobs of an old man. 



 

But "Waring, stern in avenging justice, drew him- 
self from the feeble grasp, and walked down towards 
the boats. He did not intend fairly to desert the mis- 
erable old creature. He hardly knew what he intended, 
but his impulse was to put more space between them, 
between himself and this wretch who gathered his 
evil living from dead men's bones. So he stood gaz- 
ing out to sea. A faint cry roused him, and, turning, 
he saw that the old man had dragged himself half 
across the distance between them, marking the way 
with his blood, for the bandages were loosened by his 
movements. As Waring turned, he held up his hands, 
cried aloud, and fell as if dead on the sands. "I am 
a brute," said Waring. Then he went to work and 
brought back consciousness, rebound the wounds, lifted 
the body in his strong arms and bore it down the 
beach. A sail-boat lay in a cove, with a little skiff in 
tow. Waring arranged a couch in the bottom, and 
placed the old man in an easy position on an im- 
promptu pillow made of his coat. Fog opened his 
eyes. " Anything come ashore ? " he asked faintly, try- 
ing to turn his head towards the reef. Conquering 
his repugnance, the young man walked out on the 
long point. There was nothing there; but farther 
down the coast barrels were washing up and back 
in the surf, and one box had stranded in shallow 
water. "Am I, too, a wrecker?" he asked himself, 
as with much toil and trouble he secured the booty 



 

and examined it. Yes, the barrels contained pro- 
visions. 

Old Fog, revived by the sight, lay propped at the 
stern, giving directions. Waring found himself a child 
obeying the orders of a wiser head. The load on 
board, the little skiff carrying its share behind, the 
young man set sail and away they flew over the 
angry water ; old Fog watching the sky, the sail, and 
the rudder, guiding their course with a word now and 
then, but silent otherwise. 

" Shall we see the castle soon ? " asked Waring, after 
several hours had passed. 

" We may be there by night, if the wind doesn't 
shift." 

" Have we so far to go, then ? Why, I came across 
in the half of a night." 

" Add a day to the half and you have it. I let you 
down at dawn and towed you out until noon ; then I 
spied that sail beating up, and I knew there would be 
a storm by night, and and things were desperate 
with me. So I cast you off and came over to set the 
light. It was a chance I did not count on, that your 
dug-out should float this way; I calculated that she 
would beach you safely on an island farther to the 
south." 

"And all this time, when you were letting me 
down By the way, how did you do it ? " 

" Lifted a plank in the floor." 



 

"When you were letting me down, and towing 
me out, and calculating chances, what was I, may I 
ask ? " 

" O, just a body asleep, that was all ; your punch 
was drugged, and well done too ! Of course I could 
not have you at the castle ; that was plain." 

They flew on a while longer, and then veered short 
to the left. " This boat sails well," said Waring, " and 
that is your skiff behind I see. Did you whistle for 
it that night?" 

" I let it out by a long cord while you went after the 
game-bag, and the shore-end I fastened to a little stake 
just under the edge of the water on that long slope 
of beach. I snatched it up as I ran out, and kept haul- 
ing in until I met it. You fell off that ledge, didn't 
you ?_ I calculated on that. You see I had found out 
all I wanted to know ; the only thing I feared was 
some plan for settling along that shore, or exploring it 
for something. It is my weak side ; if you had climbed 
up one of those tall trees you might have caught sight 
of the castle, that is, if there was no fog." 

" Will the fog come up now ? " 

" Hardly ; the storm has been too heavy. I suppose 
you know what day it is ? " continued the old man, 
peering up at his companion from under his shaggy 
eyebrows. 

" No ; I have lost all reckonings of time and place." 

" Purposely ? " 

 

"Yes." 

" You are worse than I am, then ; I keep a reckon- 
ing, although I do not show it. To-day is Sunday, but 
Silver does not know it ; all days are alike to her. 
Silver has never heard of the Bible," he added, slowly. 

" Yes, she has, for I told her." 

" You told her ! " cried old Fog, wringing his hands. 

" Be quiet, or you will disturb those bandages again. 
I only asked her if she had read the book, and she 
said no ; that was all. But supposing it had not been 
all, what then ? Would it harm her to know of the 
Bible?" 

" It would harm her to lose faith in me." 

" Then why have you not told her yourself ? " 

" I left her to grow up as the flowers grow," said old 
Fog, writhing on his couch. "Is she not pure and 
good ? Ah, a thousand times more than any church 
or school could make her ! " 

" And yet you have taught her to read ? " 

" I knew not what might happen. I could not 
expose her defenceless in a hard world. Eeligion is 
fancy, but education is like an armor. I cannot tell 
what may happen." 

"True. You may die, you know; you are an old 
man." 

The old man turned away his face. 

They sailed on, eating once or twice ; afternoon 
came, and then an archipelago closed in around them ; 



 

the sail was down, and the oars out. Around and 
through, across and back, in and out they wound, now 
rowing, now poling, and now and then the sail hoisted 
to scud across a space of open water. Old Fog's face 
had grown gray again, and the lines had deepened 
across his haggard cheek and set mouth ; his strength 
was failing. At last they came to a turn, broad and 
smooth like a canal. " Now I will hoist the sail 
again," said Waring. 

But old Fog shook his head. That turn leads di- 
rectly back into the marsh," he said. " Take your oar 
and push against the sedge in front." 

The young man obeyed, and lo ! it moved slowly 
aside and disclosed a narrow passage westward ; through 
this they poled their way along to open water, then 
set the sail, rounded a point, and came suddenly 
upon the castle. " Well, I am glad we are here," said 
Waring. 

Fog had fallen back. " Promise," he whispered with 
gray lips, " promise that you will not betray me to 
the child." And his glazing eyes fixed themselves on 
Waring's face with the mute appeal of a dying ani- 
mal in the hands of its captor. 

" I promise," said Waring. 

But the old man did not die ; he wavered, lingered, 
then slowly rallied, very slowly. The weeks had 
grown into a month and two before he could manage 
his boat again. In the mean time Waring hunted and 



 

fished for the household, and even sailed over to the 
reef with Fog on a bed in the bottom of the boat, 
coming back loaded with the spoil ; not once only, not 
twice did he go ; and at last he knew the way, even 
through the fog, and came and went alone, bringing 
home the very planks and beams of the ill-fated 
schooner. " They will make a bright fire in the even- 
ings," he said. The dogs lived on the north shore, went 
hunting when their master came over, and the rest of 
the time possessed their souls in patience. And what 
possessed Waring, do you ask ? His name for it was 
" necessity." " Of course I cannot leave them to 
starve," he said to himself. 

Silver came and went about the castle, at first wil- 
fully, then submissively, then shyly. She had folded 
away all her finery in wondering silence, for Waring' s 
face had shown disapproval, and now she wore always 
her simple white gown. "Can you not put up your 
hair ? " he had asked one day ; and from that moment 
the little head appeared crowned with braids. She 
worked among her flowers and fed her gulls as usual, 
but she no longer talked to them or told them stories. 
In the evenings they all sat around the hearth, and 
sometimes the little maiden sang ; Waring had taught 
her new songs. She knew the sonnets now, and 
chanted them around the castle to tunes of her own ; 
Shakespeare would not have known his stately meas- 
ures, dancing along to her rippling melodies. 



 

The black face of Orange shone and simmered with 
glee ; she nodded perpetually, and crooned and laughed 
to herself over her tasks by the hour together, a low 
chuckling laugh of exceeding content. 

And did Waring ever stop to think ? I know not. 
If he did, he forgot the thoughts when Silver came and 
sat by him in the evening with the light of the hearth- 
fire shining over her. He scarcely saw her at other 
times, except on her balcony, or at her flower-window 
as he came and went in his boat below; but in the 
evenings she sat beside him in her low chair, and laid 
sometimes her rose-leaf palm in his rough brown hand, 
or her pretty head against his arm. Old Fog sat by 
always ; but he said little, and his face was shaded by 
his hand. 

The early autumn gales swept over the lakes, leaving 
wreck and disaster behind ; but the crew of the castle 
stayed safely at home and listened to the tempest cosily, 
while the flowers bloomed on, and the gulls brought 
all their relations and colonized the balcony and win- 
dow-sills, fed daily by the fair hand of Silver. And 
Waring went not. 

Then the frosts came, and turned the forests into 
splendor ; they rowed over and brought out branches, 
and Silver decked the long room with scarlet and gold. 
And Waring went not. 

The dreary November rains began, the leaves fell, 
and the dark water surged heavily ; but a store of 




wood was piled on the flat roof, and the fire on the 
hearth blazed high. And still Waring went not. 

At last the first ice appeared, thin flakes forming 
around the log foundations of the castle ; then old Fog 
spoke. " I am quite well now, quite strong again ; you 
must go to-day, or you will find yourself frozen in here. 
As it is, you may hit a late vessel off the islands that 
will carry you below. I will sail over with you, and 
bring back the boat." 

" But you are not strong enough yet," said Waring, 
bending over his work, a shelf he was carving for Sil- 
ver ; " I cannot go and leave you here alone." 

" It is either go now, or stay all winter. You do 
not, I presume, intend to make Silver your wife, 
Silver, the daughter of Fog the wrecker." 

Waring's hands stopped; never before had the old 
man's voice taken that tone, never before had he even 
alluded to the girl as anything more than a child. On 
the contrary, he had been silent, he had been humble, 
he had been openly grateful to the strong young man 
who had taken his place on sea and shore, and kept 
the castle full and warm. " What new thing is this ? " 
thought Waring, and asked the same. 

" Is it new ? " said Fog. " I thought it old, very old. 
I mean no mystery, I speak plainly. You helped me 
in my great strait, and I thank you ; perhaps it will be 
counted unto you for good in the reckoning up of your 
life. But I am strong again, and the ice is forming. 



 

You can have no intention of making Silver your 
wife ? " 

Waring looked up, their eyes met. " No," he replied 
slowly, as though the words were being dragged out of 
him by the magnetism of the old man's gaze, " I cer- 
tainly have no such intention." 

Nothing more was said ; soon Waring rose and went 
out. But Silver spied him from her flower-room, and 
came down to the sail-boat where it lay at the foot of 
the ladder. "You are not going out this cold day," 
she said, standing by his side as he busied himself 
over the rigging. She was wrapped in a fur mantle, 
with a fur cap on her head, and her rough little shoes 
were fur-trimmed. Waring made no reply. "But I 
shall not allow it," continued the maiden, gayly. " Am 
I not queen of this castle ? You yourself have said it 
many a time. You cannot go, Jarvis; I want you 
here." And with her soft hands she blinded him 
playfully. 

" Silver, Silver," called old Fog's voice above, " come 
within ; I want you." 

After that the two men were very crafty in their 
preparations. 

The boat ready, Waring went the rounds for the last 
time. He brought down wood for several days and 
stacked it, he looked again at all the provisions and 
reckoned them over ; then he rowed to the north shore, 
visited his traps, called out the dogs from the little 



 

house he had made for them, and bade them good by. 
" I shall leave you for old Fog," he said ; " be good 
dogs, and bring in all you can for the castle." 

The dogs wagged their tails, and waited politely on 
the beach until he was out of sight : but they did not 
seem to believe his story, and went back to their house 
tranquilly without a howl The day passed as usual. 
Once the two men happened to meet in the passage- 
way. " Silver seems restless, we must wait till dark- 
ness," said Fog in a low tone. 

" Very well," replied Waring. 

At midnight they were off, rowing over the black 
water in the sail-boat, hoping for a fair wind at dawn, 
as the boat was heavy. They journeyed but slowly 
through the winding channel, leaving the sedge-gate 
open ; no danger now from intruders ; the great giant, 
Winter, had swallowed all lesser foes. It was cold, 
very cold, and they stopped awhile at dawn on the 
edge of the marsh, the last shore, to make a fire and 
heat some food before setting sail for the islands. 

" Good God ! " cried Waring. 

A boat was coming after them, a little skiff they 
both knew, and in it, paddling, in her white dress, sat 
Silver, her fur mantle at her feet where it had fallen 
unnoticed. They sprang to meet her, knee-deep in the 
icy water ; but Waring was first, and lifted her slight 
form in his arms. 

"I have found you, Jarvis," she murmured, laying 



 

her head down upon his shoulder ; then the eyes closed, 
and the hand she had tried to clasp around his neck 
fell lifeless. Close to the fire, wrapped in furs, Waring 
held her in his arms, while the old rnan bent over her, 
chafing her hands and little icy feet, and calling her 
name in an agony. 

" Let her but come back to life, and I will say not 
one word, not one word more," he cried with tears. 
"Who am I that I should torture her? You shall 
go back with us, and I will trust it all to God, all 
to God." 

" But what if I will not go back, what if I will not 
accept your trust?" said Waring, turning his head 
away from the face pillowed on his breast. 

"I do not trust you, I trust God; he will guard 
her." 

"I believe he will," said the young man, half to 
himself. And then they bore her home, not knowing 
whether her spirit was still with them, or already gone 
to that better home awaiting it in the next country. 

That night the thick ice came, and the last vessels 
fled southward. But in the lonely little castle there 
was joy; for the girl was saved, barely, with fever, 
with delirium, with long prostration, but saved ! 

When weeks had passed, and she was in her low 
chair again, propped with cushions, pallid as a snow- 
drop, weak and languid, but still there, she told her 
story, simply and without comprehension of its mean- 
ing. 



 

" I could not rest that night," she said, " I know not 
why; so I dressed softly and slipped past Orange 
asleep on her mattress by my door, and found you 
both gone, you, father, and you, Jarvis. You never 
go out at night, and it was very cold ; and Jarvis had 
taken his bag and his knapsack, and all the little 
things I know so well His gun was gone from the 
wall, his clothes from his empty room, and that pic- 
ture of the girl holding up the fruit was not on his 
table. From that I knew that something had hap- 
pened ; for it is dear to Jarvis, that picture of the girl," 
said Silver with a little quiver in her voice. With a 
quick gesture Waring drew the picture from his pocket 
and threw it into the fire ; it blazed, and was gone in 
a moment. " Then I went after you," said Silver with 
a little look of gratitude. " I know the passage through 
the south channels, and something told me you had 
gone that way. It was very cold." 

That was all, no reasoning, no excuse, no embarrass- 
ment; the flight of the little sea-bird straight to its 
mate. 

Life flowed on again in the old channel, Fog quiet, 
Silver happy, and Waring in a sort of dream. Winter 
was full upon them, and the castle beleaguered with his 
white armies both below and above, on the water and 
in the air. The two men went ashore on the ice now, 
and trapped and hunted daily, the dogs following. 
Fagots were cut and rough roads made through the 



 

forest. One would have supposed they were planning 
for a lifelong residence, the young man and the old, 
as they came and went together, now on the snow- 
crust, now plunging through breast-deep into the light 
dry mass. One day Waring said, "Let me see your 
reckoning. Do you know that to-morrow will be 
Christmas ? " 

"Silver knows nothing of Christmas," said Fog, 
roughly. 

" Then she shall know," replied Waring. 

Away he went to the woods and brought back ever- 
green. In the night he decked the cabin-like room, 
and with infinite pains constructed a little Christmas- 
tree and hung it with everything he could collect or 
contrive. 

" It is but a poor thing, after all," he said, gloomily, 
as he stood alone surveying his work. It was indeed 
a shabby little tree, only redeemed from ugliness by a 
white cross poised on the green summit ; this cross 
glittered and shone in the firelight, it was cut from 
solid ice. 

" Perhaps I can help you," said old Fog's voice be- 
hind. "I did not show you this, for fear it would 
anger you, but but there must have been a child on 
board after all." He held a little box of toys, carefully 
packed as if by a mother's hand, common toys, for 
she was only the captain's wife, and the schooner a 
small one ; the little waif had floated ashore by itself, 
and Fog had seen and hidden it. 



 

Waring said nothing, and the two men began to tie 
on the toys in silence. But after a while they warmed 
to their work and grew eager to make it beautiful ; the 
old red ribbon that Orange had given was considered 
a precious treasure-trove, and, cut in fragments, it 
gayly held the little wooden toys in place on the green 
boughs. 

Fog, grown emulous, rifled the cupboards and found 
small cakes freshly baked by the practised hand of the 
old cook; these he hung exultingly on the higher 
boughs. And now the little tree was full, and stood 
bravely in its place at the far end of the long room, 
while the white cross looked down on the toys of the 
drowned child and the ribbon of the slave, and seemed 
to sanctify them for their new use. 

Great was the surprise of Silver the next morning, 
and many the questions she asked. Out in the world, 
they told her, it was so ; trees like that were decked 
for children. 

" Am I a child ? " said Silver, thoughtfully ; " what 
do you think, papa ? " 

"What do you think?" said Waring, turning the 
question. 

" I hardly know ; sometimes I think I am, and some- 
times not ; but it is of no consequence what I am as 
long as I have you, you and papa. Tell me more 
about the little tree, Jarvis. What does it mean? 
What is that white shining toy on the top ? Is there 
a story about it ? " 



 

"Yes, there is a story; but but it is not I who 
should tell it to you," replied the young man, after a 
moment's hesitation. 

" Why not ? Whom have I in all the world to tell 
me, save you ? " said fondly the sweet child-voice. 

They did not take away the little Christmas-tree, 
but left it on its pedestal at the far end of the long 
room through the winter; and as the cross melted 
slowly, a new one took its place, and shone aloft in 
the firelight. But its story was not told. 

February came, and with it a February thaw; the 
ice stirred a little, and the breeze coming over the 
floes was singularly mild. The arctic winds and the 
airs from the Gulf Stream had met and mingled, and 
the gray fog appeared again, waving to and fro. 
"Spring has come," said Silver; "there is the dear 
fog." And she opened the window of the flower-room, 
and let out a little bird. 

"It will find no resting-place for the sole of its 
foot, for the snow is over the face of the whole earth," 
said Waring. " Our ark .has kept us cosily through 
bitter weather, has it not, little one ? " (He had 
adopted a way of calling her so.) 

" Ark," said Silver ; " what is that ? " 

"Well," answered Waring, looking down into her 
blue eyes as they stood together at the little window, 
" it was a watery residence like this ; and if Japheth, 
he was always my favorite of the three had 



 

had you there, my opinion is that he would never 
have come down at all, but would have 'resided per- 
manently on Ararat." 

Silver looked up into his face with a smile, not 
understanding what he said, nor asking to under- 
stand ; it was enough for her that he was there. And 
as she gazed her. violet eyes grew so deep, so soft, 
that the man for once (give him credit, it was the 
first time) took her into his arms. "Silver," he 
whispered, bending over her, " do you love me ? " 

"Yes," she answered in her simple, unconscious 
way, " you know I do, Jarvis." 

No color deepened in her fair face under his ardent 
gaze ; and, after a moment, he released her, almost 
roughly. The next day he told old Fog that he 
was going. 

"Where?" 

"Somewhere, this time. I've had enough of No- 
where." 

" Why do you go ? " 

"Do you want the plain truth, old man? Here 
it is, then : I am growing too fond of that girl, a 
little more and I shall not be able to leave her." 

"Then stay; she loves you." 

"A child's love." 

"She will develop " 

" Not into my wife if I know myself," said War- 
ing, curtly. 



 

Old Fog sat silent a moment. " Is she not lovely 
and good ? " he said in a low voice. 

"She is; but she is your daughter as well." 

" She is not." 

" She is not ! What then ? 

"I I do not know ; I found her, a baby, by the 
wayside." 

"A foundling! So much the better, that is even 
a step lower," said the younger man, laughing roughly. 
And the other crept away as though he had been 
struck. 

Waring set about his preparations. This time Sil- 
ver did not suspect his purpose. She had passed out 
of the quick, intuitive watchfulness of childhood. 
During these days she had taken up the habit of 
sitting by herself in the flower-room, ostensibly with 
her book or sewing ; but when they glanced in through 
the open door, her hands were lying idle on her lap 
and her eyes fixed dreamily on some opening blossom. 
Hours she sat thus, without stirring. 

Waring's plan was a wild one ; no boat could sail 
through the ice, no foot could cross the wide rifts made 
by the thaw, and weeks of the bitterest weather still 
lay between them and the spring. "Along-shore," 
he said. 

" And die pf cold and hunger," answered Yog. 

" Old man, why are you not afraid of me ? " said 
Waring, pausing in his work with a lowering glance. 



 

" Am I not stronger than you, and the master, if I 
so choose, of your castle of logs ? " 

" But you will not so choose." 

"Do not trust me too far!" 

"I do not trust you, but God." 

" For a wrecker and a murderer, you have, I must 
say, a remarkably serene conscience," sneered Waring. 

Again the old man shrank, and crept silently away. 

But when in the early dawn a dark figure stood on 
the ice adjusting its knapsack, a second figure stole 
down the ladder. "Will you go, then," it said, "go 
and leave the child ? " 

" She is no child," answered the younger man, stern- 
ly ; " and you know it." 

"To me she is." 

" I care not what she is to you ; but she shall not 
be more to me." 

" More to you ? " 

"No more than any other pretty piece of wax- 
work," replied Waring, striding away into the gray 
mist. 

Silver came to breakfast radiant, her small head 
covered from forehead to throat with the winding 
braids of gold, her eyes bright, her cheeks faintly 
tinged with the icy water of her bath. "Where is 
Jarvis ? " she asked. 

"Gone hunting," replied old Fog. 

"For all day?" 



 

" Yes ; and perhaps for all night. The weather is 
quite mild, you know." 

" Yes, papa. But I hope it will soon be cold again ; 
he cannot stay out long then," said the girl, gazing out 
over the ice with wistful eyes. 

The danger was over for that day; but the next 
morning there it was again, and with it the bitter 
cold. 

"He must come home soon now," said Silver, con- 
fidently, melting the frost on one of the little win- 
dows so that she could see out and watch for his 
coming. But he came not. As night fell the cold 
grew intense; deadly, clear, and still, with the stars 
shining brilliantly in the steel-blue of the sky. Silver 
wandered from window to window, wrapped in her fur 
mantle ; a hundred times, a thousand times she had 
scanned the ice-fields and the snow, the lake and the 
shore. "When the night closed down, she crept close 
to the old man who sat by the fire in silence, pretend- 
ing to mend his nets, but furtively watching her every 
movement. " Papa," she whispered, " where is he, 
where is he ? " And her tears fell on his hands. 

" Silver," he said, bending over her tenderly, " do I 
not love you ? Am I not enough for you ? Think, 
dear, how long we have lived here, and how happy 
we have been. He was only a stranger. Come, let us 
forget him, and go back to the old days." 

" What ! Has he gone, then ? Has Jarvis gone ? " 



 

Springing to her feet she confronted him with clinched 
hands and dilated eyes. Of all the words she had heard 
but one ; he had gone ! The poor old man tried to 
draw her down again into the shelter of his arms, but 
she seemed turned to stone, her slender form was rigid. 
"Where is he? Where is Jarvis? What have you 
done with him, you, you!" 

The quick unconscious , accusation struck to his 
heart. " Child," he said in a broken voice, " I tried to 
keep him. I would have given him my place in your 
love, in your life, but he would not. He has gone, 
he cares not for you; he is a hard, evil man." 

" He is not ! But even if he were, I love him," said 
the girl, defiantly. 

Then she threw up her arms towards heaven (alas ! 
it was no heaven to her, poor child) as if in appeal. 
"Is there no one to help me?" she cried aloud. 

"What can we do, dear?" said the old man, stand- 
ing beside her and smoothing her hair gently. "He 
would not stay, I could not keep him!" 

" I could have kept him." 

"You would not ask him to stay, if he wished to 
go?" 

" Yes, I would ; he must stay, for my sake." 

" But if he had loved you, dear, he would not have 
gone." 

" Did he say he did not love me ? " demanded Silver, 
with gleaming eyes. 



 

Old Fog hesitated. 

" Did he say he did not love me ? Did Jarvis say 
that ? " she repeated, seizing his arm with grasp of fire. 

" Yes ; he said that." 

But the lie meant to rouse her pride, killed it; as 
if struck by a visible hand, she swayed and fell to the 
floor. 

The miserable old man watched her all the night. 
She was delirious, and raved of Waring through the 
long hours. At daylight he left her with Orange, 
who, not understanding these white men's riddles, and 
sorely perplexed by Waring's desertion, yet cherished 
her darling with dumb untiring devotion, and watched 
her every breath. 

Following the solitary trail over the snow-covered 
ice and thence along-shore towards the east journeyed 
old Fog all day in the teeth of the wind, dragging a 
sledge loaded with furs, provisions, and dry wood; 
the sharp blast cut him like a knife, and the dry 
snow-pellets stung as they touched his face, and clung 
to his thin beard coated with ice. It was the worst- 
day of the winter, an evil, desolate, piercing day ; no 
human creature should dare such weather. Yet the 
old man journeyed patiently on until nightfall, and 
would have gone farther had not darkness concealed 
the track ; his fear was that new snow might fall 
deeply enough to hide it, and then there was no more 
hope of following. But nothing could be done at 



 

night, so he made his camp, a lodge under a drift 
with the snow for walls and roof, and a hot fire that 
barely melted the edges of its icy hearth. As the 
blaze flared out into the darkness, he heard a cry, and 
followed ; it was faint, but apparently not distant, and 
after some search he found the spot ; there lay Jarvis 
Waring, helpless and nearly frozen. " I thought you
