ROE CROQUETTES.

  The roes of your shad, parboiled, cooled, and rubbed into a loose,
          granulated mass.
  One fourth as much mashed potato as you have roes.
  ½ cup of drawn butter with a raw egg beaten in it.
  Chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and ½ teaspoonful of anchovy paste
          for seasoning.
  Beaten egg and cracker-crumbs.
  Dripping.

Work roes, potato, drawn butter, and seasoning together; put over the
fire in a saucepan and stir well until hot. When almost cold, make into
short rolls, dip in raw egg, then in rolled cracker, and fry to a nice
brown. Drain in a heated colander, and pile upon a hot dish.


MASHED POTATOES.

Proceed with this oft-repeated and ever-welcome dish as I have directed
upon other pages.


STEWED TOMATOES WITH ONION AND BREAD.

Empty a can of tomatoes into a saucepan, and when hot, add a small
onion, sliced, with pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Stew twenty
minutes, and add a tablespoonful of butter and a good handful of
bread-crumbs. Simmer five minutes more and pour out.


CUP CUSTARDS—BAKED.

  1 quart of milk.
  5 eggs.
  5 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  Nutmeg and vanilla.
  Powdered sugar for méringue.

Scald the milk, and pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar. Add to
this, when you have flavored it, the whites of two eggs. Fill small
stone-ware cups and set in a dripping-pan of boiling water. Bake until
“set,” cover with a méringue made of the whisked whites (reserved)
and a little powdered sugar. Bake until they begin to be tinged. Eat
cold from the cups.


CORN-STARCH CAKE.

Please see “COMMON-SENSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD” Series No. 1, “General
Receipts,” page 333.



  Second Week.      Saturday.
  ——
  Sweetbread Soup.
  Beefsteaks.      Green Peas.
  Baked Rice.      Roast Potatoes.
  ——
  Omelette aux Confitures.
  Tea and Albert Biscuits.
  ——


SWEETBREAD SOUP.

  4 lbs. of lean, coarse veal.
  ½ lb. corned ham.
  2 lbs. beef bones.
  2 fine sweetbreads.
  Bunch of parsley.
  1 onion.
  2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, soaked in cold water one hour.
  Pepper and salt.
  5 quarts of cold water.

Cut the meat into strips; crack the bones; mince the onion and parsley,
and put on with the water. Cook slowly four hours. Strain; set aside
some bits of “ragged” veal and ham for your dish of rice. Put the rest
into a crock; season highly and pour on half your soup stock—setting
this by, as usual, in a cool place for Sunday. Season the remainder
of the broth; boil and skim; put in the sweetbreads, and cook half an
hour. Take them out and drop into cold water. Add the tapioca to the
soup; simmer ten minutes; chop the sweetbreads, and put them back; boil
one minute and serve.


BEEFSTEAKS.

Flatten your steaks with the side of an axe or hatchet, taking out the
bones for your soup. Butter a gridiron—if you have no “broiler”—and
cook the steaks quickly over a bright fire, turning often as they drip.
Lay upon a hot dish; butter abundantly and season. Cover with another
heated platter, and let them stand five minutes before serving.


BAKED RICE.

Wash a cup of rice well. Take a cupful of broth from your soup-pot;
strain through a thin cloth, and add twice as much boiling water, with
a little salt. Put in the rice and cook slowly until it has taken up
all the water and is soft. Pour in a large cup of hot milk in which
have been mixed two eggs (raw), two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese,
and a tablespoonful of butter. Stir up well; add about half a cupful of
minced veal and ham, taken from your soup; turn into a greased mould;
cover and bake one hour in a dripping-pan of hot water. Dip in cold
water, and invert upon a flat dish.


GREEN PEAS.

See receipts for last Sunday week.


ROAST POTATOES.

Roast in a moderate oven until soft. Cut a piece nearly off the top
of each; thrust a thin-bladed knife into the heart, and slip in a bit
of butter. Replace the skin and send up hot.


OMELETTE AUX CONFITURES.

  7 eggs.
  2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  ½ cup of milk (or cream).
  Grated peel of ½ lemon.
  ½ cup of marmalade or jam.

Beat yolks and whites apart and very stiff. Add sugar, lemon, and
milk to the yolks; then, with a few rapid whirls of your “beater,”
the whites. Put the marmalade in the bottom of a neat bake-dish
(buttered), pour on the omelette, and bake until it has puffed up high
and begins to “crust” well. Serve at once, or it will fall. Eight
minutes should suffice to cook it—at the outside.


TEA AND ALBERT BISCUITS

May be partaken of at the same time with the omelette, or afterwards.



  Third Week.      Sunday.
  ——
  Sago Soup.
  Stuffed Shoulder of Mutton with Potato Edging.
  Boiled Asparagus.      Purée of Peas.
  ——
  Neapolitan Blanc-Mange.
  ——


SAGO SOUP.

  The stock made on yesterday.
  Little more than ½ cup of pearl sago.
  3 eggs.
  1 cup of milk.
  Pepper and salt.

Take the fat from your cold stock; pour off carefully from the sediment
and strain. Heat to boiling. Wash the sago well; soak in warm water
half an hour; put into the soup, and simmer twenty-five minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the milk in another vessel, and pour upon the eggs.
Heat this until it begins to thicken, pour into the tureen, season with
a little salt and pepper, and turn in the boiling soup. It should be
about as thick as hot custard when all the ingredients are in.


STUFFED SHOULDER OF MUTTON.

Get your butcher to take out the bone. (It will help out to-morrow’s
soup.) Fill the hole from which it was taken with a good force-meat
of crumbs, minced pork, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and one raw egg.
Sew up the edges of the skin to keep in the stuffing, and roast about
fifteen minutes—not more—for each pound, basting often, at first with
the boiling water you have poured upon it, at the last twice with
butter. When done, brush with beaten egg; sift crumbs all over it; put
into a stout stone-ware dish—or one of block-tin—surround with the
potato-edging, and brown in a quick oven. Pour off the fat from the
gravy, strain, thicken with browned flour, and serve in a boat.


POTATO EDGING.

Mash the potatoes very soft with milk and butter; beat in two eggs;
return to the saucepan and stir until smoking hot all through. Let them
get quite cool; then, mould by pressing firmly into a wet egg-cup, and
turning out each form upon the mutton-dish. Arrange the little cones
side by side until you have a barricade about the meat. Set in the oven
and brown, glazing with butter just before you take the dish out. Serve
a cone with each slice of mutton.


BOILED ASPARAGUS.

See receipt on first Sunday in May.


PURÉE OF GREEN PEAS.

  Take for half a peck of peas—
  1 small onion.
  3 tablespoonfuls of cream.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter cut up in one tablespoonful of flour.
  1 lump of white sugar.
  Pepper and salt.

Boil the empty pods twenty minutes in hot, salted water. Strain these
out, and put in the peas with the sugar. Boil gently until they are
very soft. Rub through a fine colander. Add a cupful of the water in
which they were cooked, pepper and salt, and put over the fire. When
very hot, stir in the floured butter, and, when this is mixed, the
cream. Stir three minutes and pour out into a dish lined with strips of
fried bread.


NEAPOLITAN BLANC-MANGE.

  1 quart of milk.
  1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked two hours in a cup of cold water.
  ¾ of a cup of sugar.
  1 great spoonful grated chocolate, wet in a little boiling water.
  Beaten yolk of an egg.
  1 great spoonful currant jelly, or cranberry jam.
  Rose-water for flavoring.

Heat the milk to boiling, stir in the sugar, then the gelatine.
Cook about five minutes, and strain through thin muslin. Divide the
blanc-mange into four equal portions. Beat the chocolate well into one;
heat for one minute, and put by in a cup or bowl. Do the same with the
egg to a second, and the currant jelly for the third. This last must
be heated carefully, and a little sugar added, that the milk may not
curdle. Leave the fourth white, and flavor with rose-water. When cold
and a little stiff, pour into a wet mould—the white first; when this
is so firm as to bear the weight of the next without mixing, the pink;
then, the yellow; lastly, the brown. Do this on Saturday. On Sunday dip
the mould in warm water, work the surface free with your fingers, and
turn out upon a flat dish. Eat with cream and sugar, or brandied fruit.



  Third Week.      Monday.
  ——
  Clam Soup.
  Cold Mutton.      Brussels-Sprouts.
  Raw Tomatoes.      Stewed Potatoes.
  ——
  Oranges and Bananas.
  Coffee and Cake.
  ——


CLAM SOUP.

Early in the morning crack your mutton-bone, and put on in a quart of
cold water, at the back of the range. When little more than a large
cupful of liquor remains, take it off and strain into a bowl to cool.
When perfectly cold take off the fat, put in a quart of clam liquor
and the hard parts of fifty clams. Season with a teaspoonful of minced
onion, as much chopped parsley, a pinch of mace, pepper and salt to
taste, and cook, covered, half an hour after the boil begins. Heat in
another vessel two cups of milk; when hot, stir in two tablespoonfuls
of butter, rolled in a heaping tablespoonful of flour, and set in
boiling water to keep hot, after it has boiled two minutes. Strain the
soup back into the pot, put in the soft parts of the clams—the only
digestible portions—and simmer five minutes. Pour the thickened milk
into the tureen, stir in the soup, and serve.

This is a delightful and nutritious soup, and since you are to have
cold meat for dinner, you need not grudge the care of preparing it,
even on Job’s birthday.


COLD MUTTON.

Your stuffed shoulder will be nearly as nice cold as hot. Garnish it
tastefully with curled parsley and bleached lettuce-leaves.


BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

Cook in boiling, salted water twenty-five minutes; drain well; add a
liberal lump of butter, with pepper and salt to taste, and put into a
deep dish.


RAW TOMATOES.

Peel with a sharp knife; slice, and lay in a salad-bowl. Season with a
dressing of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper in the proportions given on
last Thursday.


STEWED POTATOES.

Boil whole until a fork will pierce them. Peel quickly; crack, without
breaking, each, by pressing it, and drop into a saucepan containing
a large cup of milk, almost on the boil. When all the potatoes are
in, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, with salt and pepper. Cover and
heat—below the boiling point—until the potatoes begin to crumble. Pour
into a deep dish.


ORANGES AND BANANAS.

Serve whole, upon china plates, with a knife for each.


COFFEE AND CAKE.

You need not be ashamed of “cold meat on Monday,” even should John
have “picked up” his unexpected friend on the street, when your bright
coffee-urn, with the fragrant contents, flanked by a basket of sliced
home-made cake, comes in as a reserved force.



  Third Week.      Tuesday.
  ——
  Brown Beef Soup.
  Veal Cutlets with Ham.      String Beans.
  Chopped Potatoes.      Lettuce.
  ——
  Graham Hasty Pudding.
  ——


BROWN BEEF SOUP.

  3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef, cut into strips.
  3 onions—small ones.
  3 quarts of cold water.
  1 teaspoonful mixed allspice and mace.
  Bunch of sweet herbs chopped.
  1 teaspoonful Colgate’s essence of celery.
  Glass of brown sherry.
  Dripping.
  Toasted bread.

Fry the sliced onion brown in good dripping; then the beef, quickly.
Put into a soup-pot, cover with the water; put on a tight lid, and stew
four hours. Strain and press hard. Let the soup cool to throw up the
fat. Skim, and return to the pot, with the salt, pepper, herbs, and
spice. Simmer fifteen minutes; add wine and celery, and pour into a
tureen upon dice of crisp, buttered toast.


VEAL CUTLETS AND HAM.

  2 lbs. veal cutlets without bone.
  1½ lbs. of ham.
  Grated lemon-peel.
  Pepper and salt.
  1 raw, beaten egg.
  Rolled cracker.
  Dripping or lard.

Boil the slices of ham ten minutes; let them get cold, and cut of the
same size and shape as the strips of veal, viz., about three inches
long by one and a half wide. Salt and pepper the veal; sprinkle each
cutlet with a pinch of lemon-peel; roll in egg, then cracker, and fry
to a good brown. Fry the ham in its own fat in another pan, and lay
upon a hot dish, alternately with the cutlets.


STRING-BEANS.

If fresh, top and tail, and, with a sharp knife, take off the strings
on both sides. Cut into short pieces, and cook tender in boiling water,
and a little salt. Drain well, heap upon a hot dish; butter freely, and
season to taste.


CHOPPED POTATOES.

Chop cold boiled potatoes rather coarsely. Have ready a great spoonful
of butter in a saucepan, with a little grated lemon-peel, pepper and
salt. Stir in the potatoes until very hot, but do not let them brown.
Serve in a deep dish, after draining.


LETTUCE.

Pick out and pull apart the hearts and best blanched leaves. Pour over
it a dressing such as was directed on last Thursday.


GRAHAM HASTY PUDDING.

  2 eggs.
  1 quart of milk.
  2 even cups of Graham flour.
  ½ teaspoonful of salt.
  1 tablespoonful of butter.

Heat half the milk in a greased saucepan or farina-kettle. Wet the
flour with the rest, and beat very light with the butter—melted—the
eggs and salt. Stir this into the hot milk—or, better still—pour the
milk upon it. When thoroughly mixed, return to the fire, and stir
fifteen minutes, surrounded by boiling water at its highest bubble.
Take from the range, leave in the water five minutes; stir up again,
and serve in a deep, uncovered dish. Eat with butter, sugar, and nutmeg.



  Third Week.      Wednesday.
  ——
  Green Asparagus Soup.
  Stewed Chicken.      Scalloped Tomatoes.
  Corn Fritters.      Grape Jelly.
  Marmalade Roll.
  ——


GREEN ASPARAGUS SOUP.

  3 lbs. knuckle of veal.
  ½ lb. streaked salt pork.
  3 bunches of asparagus.
  4 quarts of water.
  1 pint of spinach leaves.
  Pepper and salt.
  1 small onion, sliced.
  Butter and sugar.

Put the veal, pork, onion, and the hard parts of the
asparagus-stalks—all cut up fine—on in the water, and boil gently four
hours. Meanwhile cook the spinach tender in a little water; chop and
squeeze it through double tarlatan back into the cupful of water in
which it was boiled. Add a lump of sugar to the green liquid. Strain
the soup; season, boil once, and skim; put in the green heads of
the asparagus (kept until now in cold water) and boil slowly twenty
minutes. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour, and
when this has boiled a minute, the green water. Simmer five minutes
more, and pour out. Dip up from the bottom with each ladleful in
helping the soup.


STEWED CHICKEN.

Cut into joints, leaving none of the pieces large. Put the scrags,
feet (having scalded off the skin), and giblets into two cupfuls of
water, and stew until the meat is in rags. Put a quarter of a pound
of pork, cut as fine as shavings, in the bottom of a saucepan; lay on
this a teaspoonful of minced onion, and then the uncooked chicken.
Strain, and partly cool the gravy, which should have boiled down to one
cupful—setting by the giblets. Pour this over the chicken, pepper and
salt; put on a tight top, and cook very slowly one hour. Then increase
the heat, but still do not let it boil hard, for half an hour longer.
Open the saucepan at the end of the first hour to change the upper
pieces to lower places—and again when the half hour is up, to see if
they are all tender. If not, cover and cook until they are. Take out
the chicken, lay in order upon a hot-water dish, and add to the gravy
the giblets, minced fine, and a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one
of flour. Boil one minute, and pour upon a half cup of milk in which
have been beaten two eggs. Set over the fire, and stir one minute, but
do not let the gravy boil. Pour upon the chicken.


SCALLOPED TOMATOES.

If raw tomatoes are dear still, drain off most of the liquor from a can
of the vegetable. Cover the bottom of a pie-dish with bread-crumbs, lay
in the tomatoes, well seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, and sugar;
cover thickly with fine, dry crumbs; put dots of butter, with pepper
and salt, over all, and bake, covered, half an hour—then, brown quickly.


CORN FRITTERS.

Drain the liquor from a can of corn, and chop the grains in a
chopping-tray. Beat into this paste three eggs, one cup of milk, a
heaping tablespoonful of sugar, and as much warmed butter, with two
tablespoonfuls of prepared flour. Beat thoroughly, season with pepper
and salt, and fry, by the spoonful, upon a greased griddle.


MARMALADE ROLL.

  1 quart prepared flour—Hecker’s always, when you can get it.
  1 tablespoonful of lard and two of butter.
  1 pint of milk, or enough for soft dough.
  1 cup of sweet marmalade.

Rub the lard into the flour; wet into a soft paste with the milk, and
roll out very thin. Baste thickly with the butter, sprinkle with flour
lightly, and roll up in close folds. Lay upon ice, or in a very cold
place, one hour. Roll out into a square sheet, a quarter of an inch
thick, spread with the marmalade, leaving a narrow margin all around,
and roll up neatly. Lay in a buttered baking-pan, the joined edge
downward, and bake three-quarters of an hour. Wash over with white of
egg, beaten with a little sugar, just before you take it up. Eat hot
with a good sauce.



  Third Week.      Thursday.
  ——
  Sheep’s Head Soup.
  Roast Beef.      Fried Potatoes.
  Asparagus with Eggs.      Spinach on Toast.
  ——
  Corn-Starch Blanc-Mange with Preserves.
  ——


SHEEP’S HEAD SOUP.

  1 sheep’s head, dressed with the skin on.
  2 onions.
  2 carrots.
  Bunch of parsley.
  Crumbs and egg for force-meat balls.
  1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.
  Pepper and salt.
  Dripping.
  4 quarts of cold water.

You will probably have to coax your butcher to dress the head properly,
but the head itself he will be willing to give you, as almost worthless
in his eyes. Be sure it is quite clean, even to the mouth. Soak it in
tepid water, one hour—then put into a pot with the vegetables, sliced,
the chopped herbs and the cold water. Cook gently four hours. Strain
off the soup, rubbing the vegetables through the sieve; let it get
almost cool, that you may remove the fat from the top, and put back
over the fire with pepper and salt. Chop the brains and mix them into a
paste with an equal quantity of crumbs; also pepper, salt, and raw egg,
with enough flour to enable you to roll into little balls. Fry these to
a nice brown, drain in a colander, and put into your tureen. Skim the
boiling soup and stir in the corn-starch wet with half a cup of milk,
then the tongue, skinned and cut into dice. Boil once and pour into the
tureen.


ROAST BEEF.

Put into your dripping-pan; pour a cupful of boiling water over it,
and roast, basting often, allowing a quarter of an hour to the pound.
Towards the last, pepper and salt, dredge with flour, and baste once
well with butter. If you send made gravy to the table, take off all the
“top-grease,” thicken the brown juice in the dripping-pan with browned
flour, boil up, and pour out into a boat.


FRIED POTATOES.

Cut peeled potatoes into long strips, not too thin. Lay in cold water
one hour, dry between two towels, and fry in boiling fat, a little
salt, to a light brown. Drain and dish upon a napkin.


SPINACH UPON TOAST.

Wash well. Cook twenty minutes in boiling, salted water. Drain and
chop very fine. Put a tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan with
a teaspoonful of sugar, a pinch of nutmeg, and pepper and salt. Stir
in the spinach, and beat smooth while it heats. At the last add a
tablespoonful of cream, or two of milk. Pour upon crustless slices of
buttered toast laid upon a flat dish.


ASPARAGUS WITH EGGS.

Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty minutes; cut off the tender tops and
lay in a deep pie-plate, buttering, salting, and peppering well. Beat
four eggs just enough to break up the yolks, add a tablespoonful of
melted butter, with pepper and salt, and pour upon the asparagus. Bake
eight minutes in a quick oven, and serve immediately.


CORN-STARCH BLANC-MANGE WITH PRESERVES.

  1 quart of milk.
  4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet in cold water.
  3 beaten eggs.
  1 cup of sugar.
  Grated peel of half a lemon.
  1 saltspoonful of salt.

Scald the milk in a farina-kettle; stir in corn-starch, lemon, and
salt, and cook five minutes. Pour this upon the beaten eggs and sugar,
return to the fire and stir two minutes more. Pour into a wet mould and
set in a cold place for four or five hours. Turn out upon a broad glass
dish, and pour rich, sweet preserves about the base.

In helping it out, put a spoonful of preserve upon each share of
blanc-mange.


  Third Week.      Friday.
  ——
  Purée of Tomatoes.
  Boiled Bass with Mushrooms.      Roast Sweetbreads.
  Mashed Potatoes.      Succotash.
  ——
  Strawberry Méringue.
  ——


PURÉE OF TOMATOES.

  1 can of tomatoes.
  2 cups boiling milk with half a teaspoonful of soda stirred in.
  1 heaping teaspoonful sugar.
  1 small minced onion.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed up with one of flour.
  Pepper and salt.
  Handful of dry bread-crumbs.
  1 cup of boiling water.

Put tomatoes and onion over the fire with the hot water. Boil half
an hour; strain and rub through a colander, working the tomatoes to
a pulp. Meanwhile, boil the milk, stir in soda, butter and flour,
and after one boil, keep hot. Put pepper, salt, and sugar with the
tomatoes; simmer five minutes; pour into the tureen; stir in the
crumbs, and one minute later the thickened milk. Serve at once. If the
milk be cooked with the purée, it will almost surely curdle.


BOILED BASS WITH MUSHROOMS.

Clean a fine bass, and sew up in a thin cloth. Put into boiling water
in which you have mixed four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with six whole
black peppers, and a little salt. Cook about twelve minutes to the
pound. Prepare a cupful of drawn butter, boil half a can of mushrooms
twenty minutes; drain, chop up and stir, with the juice of half a lemon
and a little pepper, into the drawn butter. Simmer together three
minutes—put the fish upon a hot dish, and pour one-third of the sauce
over it, serving the rest in a boat.


ROAST SWEETBREADS.

  3 or 4 fine sweetbreads.
  1 raw egg.
  ½ cup rolled crackers.
  1 cup of gravy (saved from yesterday’s fricassee).
  2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.
  1 tablespoonful mushroom or walnut catsup.
  Pepper and salt.
  Rounds of fried bread.

Parboil and blanch the sweetbreads. Dry, and dip, first, in egg, then,
in cracker-crumbs. Lay in a small dripping-pan; pour the butter over
them, set in the oven, and roast, covered, three-quarters of an hour,
basting often with the gravy. Dish upon fried bread. Add the catsup to
the gravy; boil up and strain over the sweetbreads.


MASHED POTATOES.

Prepare as usual, and pass with the fish.


SUCCOTASH.

Drain off the can liquor; cook the succotash half an hour in boiling
water; drain, add a cup of hot milk, and stir in pepper, salt, and a
great spoonful of butter cut up in flour. Simmer three minutes and pour
out.


STRAWBERRY MÉRINGUE.

Make a good puff-paste, cut out large, and round as a dinner-plate,
and bake to a light brown in a quick oven. Draw to the oven door; lay
strawberries, rolled in sugar, over it, and cover these an inch deep
with a méringue made of the whites of four eggs whisked stiff, with
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Bake until the méringue
is faintly tinged with yellow brown. Eat fresh, but not hot. It is
delicious.


  Third Week.      Saturday.
  ——
  Amber Soup.
  Ham and Omelette.      Ladies Cabbage.
  Buttered Rice.      Summer Salad.
  ——
  Irish Potato Pie.
  ——


AMBER SOUP.

This soup should be prepared very early in the day; therefore, have the
materials in the house overnight.

  4 lbs. lean beef.
  2 slices of lean ham.
  2 lbs. of veal-bones.
  2 onions, sliced and fried.
  1 carrot.
  2 teaspoonfuls essence of celery.
  Pepper, and, if required, salt.
  ½ cup granulated tapioca.
  Whites and shell of an egg.
  5 quarts of cold water.
  Butter and dripping.
  Burnt sugar.

Cut the meat into strips; put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a
soup-pot, and lay the meat in it. Let it stand where it will heat
slowly for half an hour. Then set over the fire, and stir until the
meat is glazed with a brownish crust. Put a quart of water—cold—upon
it, and bring gradually to a boil. Fry the onion and carrot in dripping
to a fine brown, and drain off the fat, then put the vegetables into
the pot with the meat, as soon as the latter is boiling hot. Cook half
an hour; put in the rest of the cold water, the minced ham, and the
bones broken to bits. Boil slowly four hours, then strain. Put meat and
bones—highly seasoned—into a stone vessel, and pour half the soup over
them for to-morrow. Put the rest back into the soup-kettle; season and
boil up. Skim with care; put in the white and shell of an egg; boil
three minutes; take from the fire and pour into a broad pan to cool.
Burn two tablespoonfuls of sugar in a tin cup, on the hot range, and
while still liquid, pour in half a cupful of boiling water. Let it
stand thus until you are ready for it. The tapioca should have been
soaking two hours in a little cold water. When the soup is cold, take
off fat and scum—every particle; return to the scalded pot; boil up
once, put in tapioca, and strain the sugar-water upon it. Simmer ten
minutes, or until the tapioca is clear; skim once again, and pour out.

This is a fine company soup, but you should make it once or twice
for family dinners in order to manage it properly. It is really not
difficult.


HAM AND OMELETTE.

  3 lbs. of ham, cut in very thin slices.
  7 eggs.
  4 tablespoonfuls of milk.
  Pepper and a little salt.
  1 large spoonful of butter.

Lay the ham in boiling water fifteen minutes, then let it get cold. Cut
off all the rind and trim each slice neatly; then broil upon a greased
gridiron. Pepper and keep hot while you prepare the omelette. Beat
whites and yolks together with a few whirls of the beater; put in the
milk and beat fast for one minute; season and pour into a frying-pan in
which the butter is heating—not hissing. Shake briskly over the fire,
slipping your cake-turner under it to prevent sticking, and in four
minutes, double it over in the middle and turn out into a hot dish by a
dexterous inversion of the pan. Lay the ham about it in the dish.


LADIES’ CABBAGE.

Boil a firm cabbage in two waters, and let it get perfectly cold.
Chop fine; add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter,
pepper, salt, and a few spoonfuls of milk. Stir all up well; put into
a buttered bake-dish, strew with fine crumbs; bake, covered, half an
hour, then brown quickly. Eat hot.


BUTTERED RICE.

Boil a cup of rice soft in hot, salted water. Drain, and heap in a
deep dish. Fry an onion (sliced) very lightly in two tablespoonfuls
of butter; add pepper, and strain the hot butter over the rice in the
dish. Pass grated cheese with it.


SUMMER SALAD.

  3 heads of lettuce.
  2 handfuls cresses.
  1 cucumber, pared and sliced.
  4 radishes, also pared and cut up.
  3 hard-boiled eggs cut lengthwise into sixths.

Cut lettuces and cresses with a sharp knife, and mix with the other
vegetables in a bowl. Pour over them a dressing made as directed on
Thursday of the second week in this month. Lay the sliced eggs on the
top of all.


IRISH POTATO PIE.

  1 lb. mashed potato, rubbed through a colander.
  ½ lb. butter, creamed with the sugar.
  6 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.
  1 lemon, squeezed into the hot potato.
  1 teaspoonful of nutmeg, and the same of mace.
  2 cups of sugar.

Mix as you would cake, putting the whites in last, and bake in open
shells of paste. Eat cold.



  Fourth Week.      Sunday.
  ——
  German Sago Soup.
  Roast Lamb.      Green Peas.
  Young Onions, Stewed.      Potato Puff.

GERMAN SAGO SOUP.

Soak half a cup of German sago in a little cold water for two hours.
Take the fat from the top of your soup stock, and pour off carefully
from the bones, etc. If you have any left from the “amber soup,” add
that, and a cupful of boiling water. Heat, season, and skim; put in the
sago, and simmer half an hour.


ROAST LAMB.

Cook as you did the mutton, last Sunday, leaving out the stuffing and
omitting the egg and crumb coating at the last. Roast about twelve
minutes to the pound.


GREEN PEAS.

See receipt for Saturday of second week in May.


YOUNG ONIONS—STEWED.

Cook ten minutes in boiling water; throw this off, and pour on a cup of
cold milk. Stew tender in this, add pepper, salt, a tablespoonful of
butter rolled in flour; simmer five minutes and turn out.


POTATO PUFF.

Mash the potatoes very soft, beating in butter, and milk, and finally,
the whipped white of an egg. Whisk to a cream; heap roughly in a neat
bake-dish and brown in a good oven.


STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM.

Cap and pile the strawberries in a glass dish. Send around powdered
sugar and a pitcher of cream with them.


SILVER CAKE.

This delicate and handsome cake should have been made on Friday or
Saturday. Please see “COMMON-SENSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD,” Series No. 1,
General Receipts, page 332.


  Fourth Week.      Monday.
  ——
  Baked Hotch-Potch.
  Minced Lamb, with Poached Eggs.
  Potato Cakes.      Raw Tomatoes.
  ——
  Bread Pudding.
  ——


BAKED HOTCH-POTCH.

  2 lbs. of lean beef.
  1 lb. of good sausage-meat.
  1 sliced onion.
  1 sliced cucumber.
  3 raw tomatoes peeled and sliced.
  Handful of asparagus-tops.
  1 sliced carrot.
  ¼ of a cabbage-heart, chopped fine.
  ½ cup of raw rice.
  2 cups of green peas.
  Pepper and salt.
  Cold water.

Cut the meat small and put in alternate layers with the vegetables and
rice, into a stout stone jar. Pour in three quarts of water, when you
have seasoned the vegetables. Fit a close cover on the jar, sealing
around the edges with a paste of flour and water. Set in the oven early
in the day and do not open for six hours; then pour into the tureen.
This is a good soup for Monday, and almost a dinner in itself.


MINCED LAMB.

Cut the meat from the bone of your cold roast. Salt the bone and put
by for another day’s soup. Mince the meat fine, season highly; put the
gravy left from yesterday (or a cup of your Sunday’s soup would be
even better) in a saucepan, when you have taken off the fat, heat it,
and stir in the mince. Make it very hot; thicken with a little browned
flour if it is too thin, and pile up in a flat dish, with poached eggs
and toast about it.


POACHED EGGS.

Nearly fill a frying-pan with boiling water. Add a little salt and
vinegar. Break your eggs, one at a time, into a wet saucer, and slip
from this upon the surface of the water. Cook slowly three minutes;
take up with a perforated skimmer, and lay carefully upon rounds of
buttered toast laid around the minced lamb.


POTATO CAKES.

Work cold mashed potato—or the remains of your “puff,” soft with a
little melted butter and milk; knead into it enough prepared flour to
enable you to roll it out into a sheet half an inch thick. Cut into
rounds like biscuit, and bake in a floured pan rather quickly to a good
brown. Glaze with butter just before you take them out. Eat hot.


RAW TOMATOES.

Please see receipt for last Monday.


BREAD PUDDING.

  2 cups fine crumbs.
  1 quart of milk.
  ¼ lb. of citron cut into short shavings.
  4 eggs.
  4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  ¼ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.
  2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.
  1 tablespoonful melted butter.

Soak the crumbs in the milk to a soft paste. Put a layer of this into
a buttered bake-dish. Sprinkle with citron, then spice, and cover with
more soaked crumbs. Having nearly filled the dish in this order, pour
over all the eggs whipped light with sugar, butter, and brandy. Bake
covered twenty-five minutes, then brown. Eat warm. It will need no
sauce.


  Fourth Week.      Tuesday.
  ——
  Cracker Soup.
  Beefsteak and Onion.      Green Peas.
  Baked Corn.      Cress-Salad.
  ——
  Jersey Puffs.
  ——


CRACKER SOUP.

  The cracked bone of the cold lamb.
  1 lb. lean mutton, chopped up.
  ½ lb. Boston crackers, split.
  2 quarts of cold water.
  2 cups boiling milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in one teaspoonful of flour.
  Pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace.
  1 sliced onion.
  A little chopped parsley.

Put meat, onion, and bones on in the water and cook slowly two hours.
Strain and cool, and take off every particle of fat. While the soup
is cooling, put your crackers into a bowl, or tin pail, salting and
peppering them. Pour on the milk, cover closely, and set for half an
hour in boiling water at one side of the range. Return the broth to
the fire, season and skim as it heats. Now strain the milk from the
crackers, if it be not all absorbed, and turn them, with care, into
your tureen. They should be like a jelly, yet retain their shape. Stir
into the soup the floured butter and parsley; boil one minute and pour
slowly upon the crackers. Set the tureen in hot water—covered—ten
minutes, before sending to the table.


BEEFSTEAK AND ONION.

Broil the steak in the usual manner and lay upon a hot dish. Pepper
and salt, and strain over it three tablespoonfuls of butter in which
a sliced Bermuda onion has simmered—not browned—for ten minutes.
Cover with a hot tin platter for five minutes, and make cuts in the
steak, here and there, to draw out the juices and enable the butter to
penetrate it. This is a nicer way of flavoring a steak than the usual
fashion of serving the onion with it.


GREEN PEAS.

Boil twenty minutes in hot, salted water, with a lump of white sugar,
unless the peas are newly gathered from the home garden. When tender,
drain well, pepper, and add a generous lump of butter. Serve hot.


BAKED CORN.

Open a can of sweet corn; drain and chop it fine. Beat up three eggs
with a tablespoonful of sugar, the same of butter, two cups of milk,
pepper and salt to taste. Stir in the corn and bake forty-five minutes
in a buttered pudding-dish.
