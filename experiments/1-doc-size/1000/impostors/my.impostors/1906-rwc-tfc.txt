servants' business. It was nobody's business except his 
own. Who the devil were all these people, to pry into 
his affairs and doctor him and dose him and form secret 
leagues to disobey him, and hide decanters from him? 
Why should anybody have the impertinence to meddle 
with him? Of what concern to them were his vices or 
his virtues? 

The tears dried in his hot eyes; he jerked the old- 
fashioned bell savagely ; and after a long while he heard 









servants whispering together in the passage-way out- 
side his door. 

He lay very still in his chair; his hearing had become abnormaHy acute, but he could not make out what 
they were saying ; and as the dull, intestinal aching grew 
sharper, parching, searing every strained muscle in 
throat and chest, he struck the table beside him, and 
clenched his teeth in the fierce rush of agony that swept 
him from head to foot, crying out an inarticulate menace 
on his household. And Dr. Grisby came into the 
room from the outer shadows of the hall. 

He was very small, very meagre, very bald, and clean- 
shaven, with a face like a nut-cracker ; and the brown wig 
he wore was atrocious, and curled fonvard over his col- 
ourless ears. He wore steel-rimmed spectacles, each glass 
divided into two lenses ; and he stood on tiptoe to look 
out through the upper lenses on the world, and always 
bent almost double to use the lower or reading lenses. 

Besides that, he affected frilled shirts, and string 
ties, which nobody had ever seen snugly tied. His loose 
string tie was the first thing Siward could remember 
about the doctor ; and that the doctor had permitted him 
to pull it when he had the measles, at the age of six. 

"What's all this racket.?" said the little old doc- 
tor harshly. " Got colic? Got the toothache? I'm 
ashamed of you, Stephen, cutting capers and pounding 
the furniture ! Look up ! Look at me ! Out with your 
tongue ! Well, now, what the devil's the trouble ? " 

" You — know," muttered Siward, abandoning his 
wrist to the little man, who seated himself beside him. 
Dr. Grisby scarcely noted the pulse; the delicate pres- 
sure had become a strong caress. 

" Know what? " he grunted. " How do I know 
what's the matter with you? Hey? Now, now, don't 





 



try to explain, Steve; don't fly off the handle! All 
right; grant that I do know what's bothering you; I 
want to see that ankle first. Here, somebody ! Light 
that gas. Why the mischief don't you have the house 
wired for electricity, Stephen? It's wholesome. Gas 
isn't. Lamps are worse, sir. Do as I tell you ! " And 
he went on loquaciously, grumbling and muttering, and 
never ceasing his talk, while Siward, wincing as the 
dressing was removed, lay back and closed his eyes. 

Half an hour later Gumble appeared, to announce 
dinner. 

" I don't want any," said Siward. 

"Eat!" said Dr. Grisby harshly. 

" I — don't care to." 

" Eat, I tell you! Do you think I dont mean what 
I say.?" 

So he ate his broth and toast, the doctor curtly de- 
clining to join him. He ate hurriedly, closing his eyes 
in aversion. Even the iced tea was flat and distasteful 
to him. 

And at last he lay back, white and unstrung, the 
momentarily deadened desperation glimmering under his 
half -closed eyes. And for a long while Dr. Grisby sat, 
doubled almost in two, cuddling his bony little knees 
and studying the patterns in the faded carpet. 

" I guess you'd better go, Stephen," he said at 
length. 

" Up the river — to Mulqueen's  " 

" Yes. Let's try it, Steve. You'll be on your feet 
in two weeks. Then you'd better go — up the river — to 
Mulqueen's." 

" I — I'll go, if you say so. But I can't go now." 

'' I didn't say go now. I said in two weeks." 

" Perhaps." 









" Will you give me your word? " demanded the doc- 
tor sharply. 

" No, doaor." 

" Why not? " 

" Because I may have to be here on business. There 
eeeras to be some sort of crisis coming which I don't 
understand." 

" There's a crisis right here, Steve, which  under- 
stand ! " snapped Dr. Grisby. " Face it hke a man ! 
Face it like a man ! You're sick — to your bones, boy — 
sick ! sick ! Fight the fight, Steve ! Fight a good fight. 
There's a fighting chance ; on my soul of honour, there 
is, Steve, a fighting chance for you ! Now ! now, boy ! 
Buckle up tight ! Tuck up your sword-sleeve ! At 'em, 
Steve! Give 'em hell! Oh, my boy, my boy, I know; 
I know ! " The little man's voice broke, but he steadied 
it instantly with a snap of his nut-cracker jaws, and 
scowled on his patient and shook his little withered fist 
at him. 

His patient lay very still in the shadow. 

" I want you to go," said the doctor harshly, " before 
your self-control goes. Do you understand ? I want you 
to go before your decision is undermined; before you 
begin to do devious things, sly things, cheating things, 
slinking things — anything and everything to get at the 
thing you crave. I've given you something to fight 
with, and you won't take it faithfully. I've given you 
free rein in tobacco and tea and coffee. I've helped you 
as much as I dare to weather the nights. Now, you 
help me — do you hear? " 

" Yes ... I will." 

" You say so ; now do it. Do something for your- 
self. Do anything! If you're sick of re£iding — and I 
don't blame you, considering the stuff you read — get 





 

people down here to see you; get lots of people. Tele- 
phone 'em; you've a telephone there, haven't you? 
There it is, by your elbow. Use it! Call up people. 
Talk all the time." 

" Yes, I wiU." 

" Good ! Now, Steve, we know what's the matter, 
physically, don't we? Of course we do! Now, then, 
what's the matter mentally ? " 

" Mentally? " repeated Siward under his breath. 

"Yes, mentally. What's the trouble? Stocks? 
Bonds? Lawsuits? Love? " the slightest pause, and 
a narrowing of the gimlet eyes behind the lenses. 
"Love?" he repeated harshly. "Which is it, boy.'' 
They're all good to let alone." 

" Business," said Siward. But, being a Siward, he 
was obliged to add " partly." 

" Business — partly,'''' repeated the doctxjr. '' Vhat's 
the matter with business — partly' ? " 

" I don't know. There are rumours. Hetherington 
is pounding us — apparently. That Inter-County crowd 
is acting ominously-, too. There's something under- 
hand, somewhere." He bent his head and fell to pluck- 
ing at the faded brocade on the arm of his chair, 
muttering to himself, " somewhere, somehow, something 
underhand. I don't know what; I really don't." 

" All right — all right," said the doctor testily ; " let 
it go at that! There's treachery, eh? You suspect it? 
You're sure of it — as reasonably sure as a gentleman 
can be of something he is not fashioned to understandi? 
That's it, is it? All right, sir — all right! Very well — 
ver-y well. Now, sir, look at me! Business symptoms 
admitted, what about the ' partly,' Stephen? — what 
about it, eh ? What about it ? " 

But Siward fell silent again. 








" Eh? Did you say something? No? Oh, very 
well, ver-y well, sir. . . . Perfectly correct, Stephen. 
You have Hot earned the right to admit further 
symptoms. No, sir, you have not earned the right 
to admit them to anybody, not even to yourself. Nor 
to-— her ! " 

" Doctor ! " 

" Sir? " 

" I have — admitted them." 

" To yourself, Steve? I'm sorry. You have no 
right to — yet. I'm sorry " 

" I have admitted them — admitted them — to ir." 

" That settles it," said the doctor grimly, " that 
clinches it ! That locks you to the wheel ! That pledges 
you. The squabble is on, now. It's your honour that's 
engaged now, not your nerves, not your intestines. It's 
a good fight — a very good fight, with no chance of losing 
anything but life. You go up the river to Mulqueen's. 
That's the strategy in this campaign; that's excellent 
manoeuvring; that's good generalship! Eh? Mask 
your purpose, Steve; make a feint of camping out here 
under my guns; then suddenly fling your entire force 
up the Hudson and fortify yourself at Mulqueen's ! Ho, 
that'll fix 'em ! That's going to astonish the enemy ! " 

His harsh, dry, crackling laughter broke out like 
the distant rattle of musketry. 

The ghost of a smile glimmered in Siward's haunted 
eyes, then faded as he leaned forward. 

" She has refused me," he said simpl}'. 

The little doctor, after an incredulous stare, began 
chattering with wrath. " Refused you \ Pah ! Pooh ! 
That's nothing! That signifies absolutely nothing! 
It's meaningless ! It's a detail. You get well — do you 
hear? You go and get well ; then try it again ! Then 


 

you'll see! And if she is an idiot — in the event of her 
irrational persistence in an incredible and utterly inde- 
fensible attitude " — he choked up, then fairly barked at 
Siward — " take her anyway, sir ! Run off with her ! 
Dominate circumstances, sir ! take charge of events ! 
. . . But you can't do it till you've clapped yourself 
into prison for life. . . . And God help you if you let 
yourself escape ! " 

And after a long while Siward said : " If I should 
ever marry — and — and " 

"Had children, eh? Is that it? Oh, it is, eh? 
Well, I say, marry ! I say, have children ! If you're 
a man, you'll breed men. The chances are they may not 
inherit what you have. It skips some generations — 
some, now and then. But if they do, good God! I say 
it's better to be bom and have a chance to fight than 
never to come into the arena at all ! By winning out, 
the world learns ; by failure, the world is no less wise. 
The important thing is birth. The main point is to 
breed — to produce — to reproduce! but not until you 
stand, sword in hand, and our armed heel on the breast 
of your prostrate and subconscious self ! " 

He jumped up and began running about the room 
with short little bantam steps, talking all the while. 

" People say, ' Shall criminals be allowed to mate 
and produce young? Shall malefactors be allowed to 
beget ? No ! ' And I say no, too. Never so long as 
they remain criminals and malefactors; so long as the 
evil in them is in the ascendant. Never, until they are 
cured. That's what I say ; that's what I maintain. 
Crime is a disease; criminals are sick people. No mar- 
riage for them until they're cured ; no children for them 
until they're well. If they cure themselves, let 'era 
marry ; let 'em breed ; for then, if their children inherit 









the inclination, they also inherit the grit to cauterise the 
malady." 

He produced a huge handkerchief from the tails of 
his coat, and wiped his damp features and polished his 
forehead so violently that his wig took a new and jaunty 
angle. 

" I'm talking too much," he said fretfully ; " I'm 
talking a great deal — all the time — continually. I've 
other patients — several — plenty! Do you think you're 
the only man I know who's trying to disfigure his liver 
and make spots come out all over inside him.? Do you.'' " 

Siward smiled again, a worn, pallid smile. 

" I can stand it while you are here, doctor, but when 
I'm alone it's — hard. One of those crises is close now. 
I've a bad night ahead — a bad outlook. Couldn't 
you " 

"No!" 

" Just enough to " 

" No, Stephen." 

" — Enough to dull it — just a little? I don't ask 
for enough to make me sleep — not even to make me 
doze. You have your needle; haven't you, doctor.' " 

" Yes." 

" Then, just this once — for the last time." 

" No." 

" Why ? Are you afraid ? You needn't be, doctor. 
I don't care for it except to give me a little respite, a 
little rest on a night like this. I'm so tired of this ache. 
If I could only have some sleep, and wake up in good 
shape, I'd stand a better chance of fighting. . . . Wait, 
doctor ! Just one moment. I don't mean to be a coward, 
but I've had a hard fight, and — I'm tired. ... If you 
could see your way to helping me " 

" I dare not help you any more that way." 




 



"Not this once?" 

" Not this once." 

There was a dead silence, broken at last by the 
doctor with a violent gesture toward the telephone. 
" Talk to the girl ! Why don't you talk to the girl ! 
If she's worth a hill o' beans she'll help you to hang on. 
What's she for, if she isn't for such moments.? Tell her 
you need her voice; tell her you need her faith in you. 
Damn central ! Talk out in church ! Don't make a 
goddess of a woman. The men who want to marry her, 
and can't, will do that! The nincompoop can always 
be counted on to deify the commonplace. And she is 
com.monplace. If she isn't, she's no good! Commend 
me to sanity and the commonplace. I take off my hat 
to it ! I honour it. God bless it ! Good-night ! " 

Siward lay still for a long while after the doctor had 
gone. More than an hour had passed before he slowly 
sat up and groped for the telephone book, opened it, 
and searched in a blind, hesitating way until he found 
the number he was looking for. 

He had never telephoned to her; he had never writ- 
ten her except once, in reply to her letter in regard 
to his mother's death — that strange, timid, formal let- 
ter, in which, grief-stunned as he was, he saw only the 
formality, and had answered it more formally still. And 
that was all that had come of the days and nights by 
that northern sea — a letter and its answer, and silence. 

And, thinking of these things, he shut the book 
wearily, and lay back in the shadow of the faded cur- 
tain, closing his sunken eyes. 







CHAPTER IX 







In a city in transition, where yesterday is as dead 
as a dead century, where those who prepare the old 
year for burial are already taking the ante-mortem state- 
ment of the new, the future fulfils the functions of the 
present. Time itself is considered merely as a by- 
product of horse-power, discounted with flippancy as the 
unavoidable friction clogging the fly-wheel of progress. 

Memory, once a fine art, is becoming a lost art in 
Manhattan. 

His world and his city had almost ceased to think 
of Siward. 

For a few weeks men spoke of him in the several 
clubs of which he had lately been a member — spoke of 
him always in the past tense; and after a little while 
spoke of him no more. 

In that section of the social system which he had 
inhabited, his absence on account of his mother's death 
being taken for granted, people laid him away in their 
minds almost as ceremoniously as they had laid away 
the memory of his mother. Nothing halted because he 
was not present; nothing was delayed, rearranged, or 
abandoned because his familiar presence chanced to be 
missing. There remained only one more place to fill at 
a cotillion, dinner, or bridge party ; only another man 
for opera box or week's end; one man the more to be 
counted on, one more man to be counted out — trans- 





 

ferred to the credit of profit and loss, and the ledger 
closed for the season. 

They who remembered him, among those who had 
not yet lost that old-fashioned art, were very few — a 
young girl here and there, over whom he had been ab- 
sent-mindedly sentimental; a debutante or two who had 
adored him from a distance as a friend of elder sister 
or brother; here and there an old, old lady to whom 
he had been considerate, and who perhaps remembered 
something of the winning charm of the Siwards when 
the town was young — his father, perhaps, perhaps his 
grandfather — these thought of him at intervals ; the 
remainder had no leisure to remember even if they had 
not forgotten how to do it. Several cabmen missed him 
for a while; now and then a privileged cafe waiter in- 
quired about him from gay, noisy parties entering some 
old haunt of his. Mr. Desmond, of art gallery and 
roulette notoriety, whose business is not to forget, was 
politely regretful at liis absence from certain occult cer- 
emonies which he had at irregular intervals graced with 
votive offerings. And the list ended there — almost, not 
quite; for there were two people who had not forgotten 
Siward : Howard Quarrier and Beverly Plank ; and one 
other, a third, who could not yet forget him if she would 
— but, as yet, she had not tried very desperately. 

The day that Siward left New York to visit every- 
body's friend, Mr. Mulqueen, in the country. Plank 
called on him for the second time in his life, and was 
presently received in the south drawing-room, the li- 
brary being limited to an informality and intimacy not 
for Mr. Plank. 

Siward, still lame, and using unskilfully two shiny 
new crutches, came down the stairs and stumped into 
the drawing-room, which, in spite of the sombre, cluster- 









ing curtains, was brightly illuminated by the winter 
sunshine reflected from the snow in the street. Plank 
was shocked at the change in him — at the ghost of a 
voice, listlessly formal; at the thin, nerveless hand of- 
fered; startled, so that he forgot his shyness, and re- 
tained the bony hand tightly in his, and instinctively 
laid his other great cushion-like paw over it, holding 
it imprisoned, unable to speak, unconscious, in the im- 
pulse of the moment, of the liberty he permitted him- 
self, and which he had never dreamed of taking with 
such a man as Siward. 

The effect on Siward was composite; his tired voice 
ceased; surprise, inability to understand tinged with 
instinctive displeasure, were succeeded by humourous 
curiosity; and, very slowly it became plain to him that 
this beefy young man liked him, was naively con- 
cerned about him, felt friendly toward him, and was 
showing it as spontaneously as a child. Because he now 
understood something of how it is with a man who is 
in the process of being forgotten, his perceptions were 
perhaps the finer in these days, and the direct uncon- 
sciousness of Plank touched him more heavily than the 
pair of heavy hands enclosing his. 

" I thought I'd come," began Plank, growing red- 
der and redder as he began to realise the enormity of 
familiarity committed only on the warrant of impulse. 
" You don't look well." 

" It was good of you to think of me," said Siward. 
'• Come up to the library, if you've a few minutes to 
spare an invalid. Please go first ; I'm a trifle lame yet." 

" I — I am sorry," muttered Plank, " very, very 
sorry." 

At first, in the library. Plank was awkward and si- 
lent, finding nothing to say, and nowhere to dispose of 





 

his hands, until Siward gave him a cigar to occupy his 
fingers. Even then he continued to sit uncomfortably, 
his bulk balanced on a rickety, spindle-legged chair, 
vhich he stubbornly refused to exchange for another, at 
Siward's suggestion, out of sheer embarrassment, and 
with a confused idea that his refusal would somehow ul- 
timately put him at his ease with his surroundings. 

Siward, secretly amused, rang for tea, although the 
hour was early. After a little while, either the toast 
or the tea appeared to act on Plank as a lingual laxa- 
tive, for he began suddenly to talk, which is character- 
istic of bashful men ; and Siward gravely helped him on 
when he floundered and turned shy. After a little, 
matters went very well with them, and Plank, much 
more at ease than he had ever dared to hope he could be 
with Siward, talked and talked ; and Siward, his crutches 
across his knees, lay back in his arm-chair, chatting with 
that winning informality so becoming to men who are 
unconscious of their charm. 

Watching Plank, it occurred to him gradually that 
this great, cumbersome creature was not a shrewd, 
thrifty, self-made and self -finished adult at all; only a 
big, wistful, lonely boy, without comrades and with no- 
where to play. On Plank's round face there remained 
no trace of shrewdness, of stubbornness, nothing even of 
the heavy, saturnine placidity of a dogged man who 
waits his turn. 

Plank spoke of himself after a while, sounding the 
personal note with tentative timidity. Siward gravely 
encouraged him, and in a little while the outlines of his 
crude autobiography appeared, embodying his eventless 
boyhood in a Pennsylvania town ; his career at the high 
school ; the dawning desire for college equipment, satis- 
fied by his father, who owned shares in the promising 









Deepvalc Steel Plank Company ; the unhappy years at 
Harvard — hard years, for he learned with difficulty ; 
solitary years, for he was not sought by those whom he 
desired to know. Then he ventured to speak of his 
father's growing interest in steel ; the merging and ab- 
sorbing of independent plants ; his own entrj' upon the 
scene on the death of his father; and — the rest — mate- 
rial fortune and prosperity, which, perhaps, might 
stand substitute as a social sponsor for him ; stand, per- 
haps, for something of what he lacked in himself, which 
only long residence amid the best, long-formed habits 
for the best, or a long inheritance of the best could 
give. Did Siward think so.? Was the best beyond his 
reach.'' Was it hopeless for such a man as he to try? 
And why.f 

The innocent snobbery, the abashed but absolute 
simplicity of this ponderous pilgrim from the smelting 
pits clambering upward through the high school of the 
smoky town, groping laboriously through the chilly 
halls of Harvard toward the outer breastworks of Man- 
hattan, interested Siward ; and he said so in his pleasant 
way, without offence, and with a smiling question at 
the end. 

" Worth while ? " repeated Plank, flushing heavily, 
" it is worth while to me. I have always desired to be 
a part of the best that there is in my own country ; and 
the best is here, isn't it.' " 

" Not necessarily," said Siward, still smiling. " The 
noisiest is here, and some of the best." 

"Which is the best.''" inquired Plank naively. 

" Why, all plain people, whose education, breeding, 
and fortune permit them the luxury of thinking, and 
whose tastes, intelligence, and sanity enable them to ex- 
press their thoughts. There are such people here, and 





 

some of them form a portion of the gaudier and noisier 
galaxy we call society." 

" That is what I wish to be part of," said Plank. 
" Could you tell me what are the requirements.'' " 

" I don't believe I could, exactly," said Siward, 
amused. " With us, the social system, as an established 
and finished system, has too recently been evolved from 
outer chaos to be characteristic of anything except the 
crudity and energy of the chaos from which it emerged. 
The balance between wealth, intelligence, and breeding 
has not yet been established — not from lack of wealth 
or intelligence. The formula has not been announced, 
that is all." 

"What is the formula?" insisted Plank. 

" The formula is the receipt for a real society," replied Siward, laughing. " At present we have its uncombined ingredients in the raw — noisy wealth and flippant fashion, arrogant intelligence and dowdy breeding 
— all excellent materials, when filtered and fused in the 
retort; and many of our test tubes have already pre- 
cipitated pure metal besides, and our national laboratory 
is turning out fine alloys. Some day we'll understand 
the formula, and we'll weld the entire mass ; and that 
will be society, Mr. Plank." 

" In the meanwhile," repeated Plank, unsmiling, " I 
want to be part of the best we have. I want to be part 
of the brightness of things. I mean, that I cannot be 
contented with an imitation." 

" An imitation .'' " 

" Of the best — of what you say is not yet society. 
I ask no more than your footing among the people of 
this city. I wish to be able to go where such men as 
you go; be permitted, asked, desired to be part of what 
you always have been part of. Is it a great deal I 









ask? Tell me, Mr. Siward — for I don't know — is it too 
much to expect? " 

" I don't think it is a very high ambition," said Si- 
ward, smiling. " What you ask is not very much to 
ask of life, Mr. Plank." 

" But is there any reason why I may not hope to 
go where I wish to go? " 

" I think it depends upon yourself," said Siward, 
" upon your capacity for being, or for making people 
believe you to be exactly what they require. You ask 
me whether you may be able to go where you desire; 
and I answer you that there is no limit to any journey 
except the sprinting ability of the pilgrim." 

Plank laughed a little, and his squared jaws relaxed; 
then, after a few moments' thought: 

" It is curious that what you cast away from you 
so easily, I am waiting for with all the patience I have 
in me. And yet it is always yours to pick up again 
whenever you wish; and I may never live to possess it." 

He was so perfectly right that Siward said noth- 
ing; in fact, he could have no particular interest or 
sympathy for a man's quest of what he himself did not 
understand the lack of. Those born without a tag un- 
mistakably ticketing them and their positions in the 
world were perforce ticketed. Siward took it for 
granted that a man belonged where he was to be met; 
and all he cared about was to find him civil, whether he 
happened to be a policeman or a master of fox-hounds. 

He was, now that he knew Plank, contented to ac- 
cept him anywhere he met him ; but Plank's upward evo- 
lutions upon the social ladder were of no interest to him, 
and his naive snobbery was becoming something of a 
bore. 

So Siward directed the conversation into other chan- 




 

nels, and Plank, accepting another cup of tea, became 
very communicative about his stables and his dogs, and 
the preservation of game; and after a while, looking 
up confidently at Siward, he said: 

" Do you think it beastly to drive pheasants the 
way I did at Black Fells? I have heard that you were 
disgusted." 

" It isn't my idea of a square deal,'' said Siward 
frankly. 

" That settles it, then." 

'' But you should not let me interfere with " 

'' I'll take your opinion, and thank you for it. It 
didn't seem to me to be the thing; only it's done over 
here, you know. The De Coursay's and the " 

" Yes, I know. . . . Glad you feel that way about 
it. Plank. It's pretty rotten sportsmanship. Don't you 
think so?" 

" I do. I — would you — I should like to ask you to 
try some square shooting at the Fells," stammered 
Plank, " next season, if you would care to." 

" You're very good. I should like to, if I were 
going to shoot at all ; but I fancy my shooting days are 
over, for a while." 

" Over ! " 

" Business," nodded Siward, absently grave again. 
'' I see no prospect of my idling for the next year or 
two." 

" You are in — in Amalgamated Electric, I think," 
ventured Plank. 

" Very much in," replied the other frankly. 
" You've read the papers and heard rumours, I sup- 
pose? " 

" Some. I don't suppose anybody quite understands 
the attacks on Amalgamated." 









" I don't — not yet. Do you ? " 

Plank sat silent, then his shrewd under lip began to 
protrude. 

" I'm wondering," he began cautiously, " how much 
the Algonquin crowd understands about the matter.'' " 

Siward's troubled eyes were on him as he spoke, 
watching closely, narrowly. 

" I've heard that rumour before," he said. 

" So have I," said Plank, " and it seems incredible." 
He looked warily at Siward. " Suppose it is true that 
the Algonquin Trust Company is godfather to Inter- 
County. That doesn't explain why a man should kick 
his own door down when there's a bell to ring and ser- 
vants to let him in — and out again, too." 

" I have wondered," said Siward, " whether the door 
he might be inclined to kick down is really his own door 
any longer." 

" I, too," said Plank simply. " It may belong to 
a personal enemy — if he has any. He could afford to 
have an enemy, I suppose." 

Siward nodded. 

" Then, hadn't you better — I beg your pardon ! 
You have not asked me to advise you." 

" No. I may ask your advice some day. Will you 
give it when I do.'' " 

" With pleasure," said Plank, so warmly disinter- 
ested, so plainly proud and eager to do a service that 
Siward, surprised and touched, found no word to utter. 

Plank rose. Siward attempted to stand up, but had 
trouble with his crutches. 

" Please don't try," said Plank, coming over and 
offering his hand. "May I stop in again soon? Oh, 
you are off to the country for a month or two.'' I see. 
. . . You don't look very well. I hope it will benefit 





 

you. Awfully glad to have seen you. I — I hope you 
won't forget me — entirely." 

" I am the man people are forgetting," returned 
Siward, " not }'ou. It was very nice of you to come. 
You are one of very few who remember me at all." 

" I have very few people to remember," said Plank ; 
" and if I had as many as I could desire I should re- 
member you first." 

Here he became very much embarrassed. Siward of- 
fered his hand again. Plank shook it awkwardly, and 
went away on tiptoe down the stairs which creaked de- 
corously under his weight. 

And that ended the first interview between Plank and 
Siward in the first days of the latter's decline. 

The months that passed during Siward's absence 
from the city began to prove rather eventful for Plank. 
He was finally elected a member of the Patroons Club, 
without serious opposition ; he had dined twice with the 
Kemp Ferralls ; he and Major Belwether were seen to- 
gether at the Caithness dance, and in the Caithness box 
at the opera. Once a respectable newspaper reported 
him at Tuxedo for the week's end; his name, linked 
with the clergy, frequently occupied such space under 
the column headed " Ecclesiastical News " as was de- 
voted to the progress of the new chapel, and many old 
ladies began to become familiar with his name. 

At the right moment the Mortimers featured him 
between two fashionable bishops at a dinner. Mrs. Ven- 
denning, who adored bishops, immediately remembered 
him among those asked to her famous annual bal poudre ; 
a celebrated yacht club admitted him to membership ; a 
whole shoal of excellent minor clubs which really needed 
new members followed suit, and even the rock-ribbed 
Lenox, wearied of its own time-honoured immobility, dis- 









played the preliminary fidgets which boded well for 
the stohd candidate. The Mountain was preparing to 
take the first stiff step toward Mohammed. It was the 
prophet's cue to sit tight and yawn occasionally. 

Meanwhile he didn't want to ; he was becoming anx- 
ious to do things for himself, which Leila Mortimer, of 
course, would not permit. It was difficult for him to 
understand that any effort of his own would probably 
be disastrous ; that progress could come only through 
his own receptive passivity ; that nothing was demanded, 
nothing required, nothing permitted from him as yet, 
save a capacity for assimilating such opportunities as 
sections of the social system condescended to offer. 

For instance, he wanted to open his art gallery to 
the public ; he said it was good strategy ; and Mrs. Mor- 
timer sat upon the suggestion with a shrug of her pretty 
shoulders. Well, then, couldn't he possibly do some- 
thing with his great, gilded ball-room ? No, he couldn't ; 
and the less in evidence his galleries and his ball-rooms 
were at present the better his chances with people who, 
perfectly aware that he possessed them, were very slowly 
learning to overlook the insolence of the accident that 
permitted him to possess what they had never known 
the want of. First of all people must tire of repeating 
to each other that he was nobody, and that would hap- 
pen when they wearied of explaining to one another why 
he was ever asked anywhere. There was time enough 
for him to offer amusement to people after they had 
ceased to find amusement in snubbing him ; plenty of 
time in the future for them to lash him to a gallop for 
their pleasure. In the meanwhile he was doing very 
w ell, because he began to appear regularly in the Caith- 
ness-Bonnesdel box, and old Peter Caithness was already 
boring him at the Patroons ; which meant that the 





 

thrifty old gentleman considered Plank's millions as a 
possible underpinning for the sagging house of Caith- 
ness, of which his palhd daughter Agatha was the sole 
sustaining caryatid in perspective. 

Yes, he was doing well; for that despotic beauty, 
Sylvia Landis, whose capricious perversity had recently 
astonished those who remembered her in her first season 
as a sweet, reasonable, and unspoiled giri, was always 
friendly with him. That must be looked upon as im- 
portant, considering Sylvia's unassailable position, and 
her kinship to the autocratic old lady whose kindly 
ukase had for generations remained the undisputed law 
in the social system of Manhattan. 

" There is another matter," said Leila Mortimer in- 
nocently, as Plank, lingering after a disastrous rubber 
of bridge with her, her husband, and Agatha Caithness, 
had followed her into her own apartments to write his 
cheque for what he owed. " You've driven with me so 
much and you come here so often and we are seen to- 
gether so frequently that the clans are sharpening up 
their dirks for us. And that helps some." 

" What ! " exclaimed Plank, reddening, and twist- 
ing around in his chair. 

" Certainly. You didn't suppose I could escape, did 
you ? " 

"Escape! What.''" demanded Plank, getting red- 
der. 

" Escape being talked about, savagely, mercilessly. 
Can't you see how it helps? Oh dear, are you stupid, 
Beverly?" 

" I don't know," replied Plank, staring, " just how 
stupid I am. If you mean that I'm compromising 
you " 

" Oh, please ! Why do you use back-stairs words ? 








Nobody talks about compromising now ; all that went 
out with New Year's calls and brown-stone stoops." 

"What do they call it, then?" asked Plank seri- 
ously. 

" Call what.'' you great boy ! '' 

" What you say I'm doing.? "
