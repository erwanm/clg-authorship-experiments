“Your father’s son, and no mistake.” Mr. Grew leaned forward. “You’re
the son of as big a fool as yourself. And here he sits, Ronald Grew.”

The young man’s flush deepened to crimson; but Mr. Grew checked his
reply with a decisive gesture. “Here he sits, with all your young
nonsense still alive in him. Don’t you see the likeness? If you don’t,
I’ll tell you the story of those letters.”

Ronald stared. “What do you mean? Don’t they tell their own story?”

“I supposed they did when I gave them to you; but you’ve given it a
twist that needs straightening out.” Mr. Grew squared his elbows on the
table, and looked at the young man across the gift-books and the dyed
pampas grass. “I wrote all the letters that Dolbrowski answered.”

Ronald gave back his look in frowning perplexity. “You wrote them? I
don’t understand. His letters are all addressed to my mother.”

“Yes. And he thought he was corresponding with her.”

“But my mother--what did she think?”

Mr. Grew hesitated, puckering his thick lids. “Well, I guess she kinder
thought it was a joke. Your mother didn’t think about things much.”

Ronald continued to bend a puzzled frown on the question. “I don’t
understand,” he reiterated.

Mr. Grew cleared his throat with a nervous laugh. “Well, I don’t know
as you ever will--quite. But this is the way it came about. I had a
toughish time of it when I was young. Oh, I don’t mean so much the fight
I had to put up to make my way--there was always plenty of fight in
me. But inside of myself it was kinder lonesome. And the outside didn’t
attract callers.” He laughed again, with an apologetic gesture toward
his broad blinking face. “When I went round with the other young fellows
I was always the forlorn hope--the one that had to eat the drumsticks
and dance with the left-overs. As sure as there was a blighter at a
picnic I had to swing her, and feed her, and drive her home. And all the
time I was mad after all the things you’ve got--poetry and music and all
the joy-forever business. So there were the pair of us--my face and my
imagination--chained together, and fighting, and hating each other like
poison.

“Then your mother came along and took pity on me. It sets up a gawky
fellow to find a girl who ain’t ashamed to be seen walking with him
Sundays. And I was grateful to your mother, and we got along first-rate.
Only I couldn’t say things to her--and she couldn’t answer. Well--one
day, a few months after we were married, Dolbrowski came to New York,
and the whole place went wild about him. I’d never heard any good music,
but I’d always had an inkling of what it must be like, though I couldn’t
tell you to this day how I knew. Well, your mother read about him in the
papers too, and she thought it’d be the swagger thing to go to New York
and hear him play--so we went... I’ll never forget that evening. Your
mother wasn’t easily stirred up--she never seemed to need to let off
steam. But that night she seemed to understand the way I felt. And when
we got back to the hotel she said suddenly: ‘I’d like to tell him how I
feel. I’d like to sit right down and write to him.’

“‘Would you?’ I said. ‘So would I.’

“There was paper and pens there before us, and I pulled a sheet toward
me, and began to write. ‘Is this what you’d like to say to him?’ I
asked her when the letter was done. And she got pink and said: ‘I don’t
understand it, but it’s lovely.’ And she copied it out and signed her
name to it, and sent it.”

Mr. Grew paused, and Ronald sat silent, with lowered eyes.

“That’s how it began; and that’s where I thought it would end. But it
didn’t, because Dolbrowski answered. His first letter was dated January
10, 1872. I guess you’ll find I’m correct. Well, I went back to hear him
again, and I wrote him after the performance, and he answered again. And
after that we kept it up for six months. Your mother always copied the
letters and signed them. She seemed to think it was a kinder joke, and
she was proud of his answering my letters. But she never went back to
New York to hear him, though I saved up enough to give her the treat
again. She was too lazy, and she let me go without her. I heard him
three times in New York; and in the spring he came to Wingfield and
played once at the Academy. Your mother was sick and couldn’t go; so I
went alone. After the performance I meant to get one of the directors to
take me in to see him; but when the time came, I just went back home
and wrote to him instead. And the month after, before he went back to
Europe, he sent your mother a last little note, and that picture hanging
up there...”

Mr. Grew paused again, and both men lifted their eyes to the photograph.

“Is that all?” Ronald slowly asked.

“That’s all--every bit of it,” said Mr. Grew.

“And my mother--my mother never even spoke to Dolbrowski?”

“Never. She never even saw him but that once in New York at his
concert.”

The blood crept again to Ronald’s face. “Are you sure of that, sir?” he
asked in a trembling voice.

“Sure as I am that I’m sitting here. Why, she was too lazy to look at
his letters after the first novelty wore off. She copied the answers
just to humor me--but she always said she couldn’t understand what we
wrote.”

“But how could you go on with such a correspondence? It’s incredible!”

Mr. Grew looked at his son thoughtfully. “I suppose it is, to you.
You’ve only had to put out your hand and get the things I was starving
for--music, and good talk, and ideas. Those letters gave me all that.
You’ve read them, and you know that Dolbrowski was not only a great
musician but a great man. There was nothing beautiful he didn’t see,
nothing fine he didn’t feel. For six months I breathed his air, and I’ve
lived on it ever since. Do you begin to understand a little now?”

“Yes--a little. But why write in my mother’s name? Why make it a
sentimental correspondence?”

Mr. Grew reddened to his bald temples. “Why, I tell you it began that
way, as a kinder joke. And when I saw that the first letter pleased and
interested him, I was afraid to tell him--I couldn’t tell him. Do you
suppose he’d gone on writing if he’d ever seen me, Ronny?”

Ronald suddenly looked at him with new eyes. “But he must have thought
your letters very beautiful--to go on as he did,” he broke out.

“Well--I did my best,” said Mr. Grew modestly.

Ronald pursued his idea. “Where are all your letters, I wonder?
Weren’t they returned to you at his death?”

Mr. Grew laughed. “Lord, no. I guess he had trunks and trunks full of
better ones. I guess Queens and Empresses wrote to him.”

“I should have liked to see your letters,” the young man insisted.

“Well, they weren’t bad,” said Mr. Grew drily. “But I’ll tell you one
thing, Ronny,” he added suddenly. Ronald raised his head with a quick
glance, and Mr. Grew continued: “I’ll tell you where the best of those
letters is--it’s in you. If it hadn’t been for that one look at life I
couldn’t have made you what you are. Oh, I know you’ve done a good deal
of your own making--but I’ve been there behind you all the time. And
you’ll never know the work I’ve spared you and the time I’ve saved you.
Fortune Dolbrowski helped me do that. I never saw things in little again
after I’d looked at ‘em with him. And I tried to give you the big view
from the stars... So that’s what became of my letters.”

Mr. Grew paused, and for a long time Ronald sat motionless, his elbows
on the table, his face dropped on his hands.

Suddenly Mr. Grew’s touch fell on his shoulder.

“Look at here, Ronald Grew--do you want me to tell you how you’re
feeling at this minute? Just a mite let down, after all, at the idea
that you ain’t the romantic figure you’d got to think yourself... Well,
that’s natural enough, too; but I’ll tell you what it proves. It proves
you’re my son right enough, if any more proof was needed. For it’s just
the kind of fool nonsense I used to feel at your age--and if there’s
anybody here to laugh at it’s myself, and not you. And you can laugh at
me just as much as you like...”




THE DAUNT DIANA


I


“WHAT’S become of the Daunt Diana? You mean to say you never heard the
sequel?”

Ringham Finney threw himself back into his chair with the smile of the
collector who has a good thing to show. He knew he had a good listener,
at any rate. I don’t think much of Ringham’s snuff-boxes, but his
anecdotes are usually worth while. He’s a psychologist astray among
bibelots, and the best bits he brings back from his raids on
Christie’s and the Hotel Drouot are the fragments of human nature he
picks up on those historic battle-fields. If his flair in enamel had
been half as good we should have heard of the Finney collection by this
time.

He really has--queer fatuous investigator!--an unusually sensitive touch
for the human texture, and the specimens he gathers into his museum
of heterogeneous memories have almost always some mark of the rare and
chosen. I felt, therefore, that I was really to be congratulated on
the fact that I didn’t know what had become of the Daunt Diana, and on
having before me a long evening in which to learn. I had just led
my friend back, after an excellent dinner at Foyot’s, to the shabby
pleasant sitting-room of my rive-gauche hotel; and I knew that, once
I had settled him in a good arm-chair, and put a box of cigars at his
elbow, I could trust him not to budge till I had the story.



II


YOU remember old Neave, of course? Little Humphrey Neave, I mean. We
used to see him pottering about Rome years ago. He lived in two tiny
rooms over a wine shop, on polenta and lentils, and prowled among the
refuse of the Ripetta whenever he had a few soldi to spend. But you’ve
been out of the collector’s world for so long that you may not know what
happened to him afterward...

He was always a queer chap, Neave; years older than you and me, of
course--and even when I first knew him, in my raw Roman days, he gave
me an extraordinary sense of age and experience. I don’t think I’ve ever
known any one who was at once so intelligent and so simple. It’s the
precise combination that results in romance; and poor little Neave was
romantic.

He told me once how he’d come to Rome. He was originaire of Mystic,
Connecticut--and he wanted to get as far away from it as possible. Rome
seemed as far as anything on the same planet could be; and after he’d
worried his way through Harvard--with shifts and shavings that you and
I can’t imagine--he contrived to get sent to Switzerland as tutor to a
chap who’d failed in his examinations. With only the Alps between, he
wasn’t likely to turn back; and he got another fellow to take his pupil
home, and struck out on foot for the seven hills.

I’m telling you these early details merely to give you a notion of the
man’s idealism. There was a cool persistency and a headlong courage in
his dash for Rome that one wouldn’t have guessed in the little pottering
chap we used to know. Once on the spot, he got more tutoring, managed to
make himself a name for coaxing balky youths to take their fences, and
was finally able to take up the more congenial task of expounding “the
antiquities” to cultured travellers. I call it more congenial--but how
it must have seared his soul! Fancy unveiling the sacred scars of Time
to ladies who murmur: “Was this actually the spot--?” while they
absently feel for their hatpins! He used to say that nothing kept him
at it but the exquisite thought of accumulating the lire for his
collection. For the Neave collection, my dear fellow, began early, began
almost with his Roman life, began in a series of little nameless odds
and ends, broken trinkets, torn embroideries, the amputated extremities
of maimed marbles: things that even the rag-picker had pitched away when
he sifted his haul. But they weren’t nameless or meaningless to Neave;
his strength lay in his instinct for identifying, putting together,
seeing significant relations. He was a regular Cuvier of bric-a-brac.
And during those early years, when he had time to brood over trifles and
note imperceptible differences, he gradually sharpened his instinct, and
made it into the delicate and redoubtable instrument it is. Before he
had a thousand francs’ worth of anticaglie to his name he began to be
known as an expert, and the big dealers were glad to consult him. But
we’re getting no nearer the Daunt Diana...

Well, some fifteen years ago, in London, I ran across Neave at
Christie’s. He was the same little man we’d known, effaced, bleached,
indistinct, like a poor “impression”--as unnoticeable as one of his own
early finds, yet, like them, with a quality, if one had an eye for
it. He told me he still lived in Rome, and had contrived, by fierce
self-denial, to get a few decent bits together--“piecemeal, little by
little, with fasting and prayer; and I mean the fasting literally!” he
said.

He had run over to London for his annual “look-round”--I fancy one or
another of the big collectors usually paid his journey--and when we met
he was on his way to see the Daunt collection. You know old Daunt was a
surly brute, and the things weren’t easily seen; but he had heard Neave
was in London, and had sent--yes, actually sent!--for him to come and
give his opinion on a few bits, including the Diana. The little man bore
himself discreetly, but you can imagine his pride. In his exultation he
asked me to come with him--“Oh, I’ve the grandes et petites entrees,
my dear fellow: I’ve made my conditions--” and so it happened that I saw
the first meeting between Humphrey Neave and his fate.

For that collection was his fate: or, one may say, it was embodied in
the Diana who was queen and goddess of the realm. Yes--I shall always be
glad I was with Neave when he had his first look at the Diana. I see him
now, blinking at her through his white lashes, and stroking his seedy
wisp of a moustache to hide a twitch of the muscles. It was all very
quiet, but it was the coup de foudre. I could see that by the way
his hands trembled when he turned away and began to examine the other
things. You remember Neave’s hands--thin, sallow, dry, with long
inquisitive fingers thrown out like antennae? Whatever they hold--bronze
or lace, hard enamel or brittle glass--they have an air of conforming
themselves to the texture of the thing, and sucking out of it, by every
finger-tip, the mysterious essence it has secreted. Well, that day,
as he moved about among Daunt’s treasures, the Diana followed him
everywhere. He didn’t look back at her--he gave himself to the business
he was there for--but whatever he touched, he felt her. And on the
threshold he turned and gave her his first free look--the kind of look
that says: “You’re mine.”

It amused me at the time--the idea of little Neave making eyes at any of
Daunt’s belongings. He might as well have coquetted with the Kohinoor.
And the same idea seemed to strike him; for as we turned away from the
big house in Belgravia he glanced up at it and said, with a bitterness
I’d never heard in him: “Good Lord! To think of that lumpy fool having
those things to handle! Did you notice his stupid stumps of fingers? I
suppose he blunted them gouging nuggets out of the gold fields. And in
exchange for the nuggets he gets all that in a year--only has to hold
out his callous palm to have that great ripe sphere of beauty drop into
it! That’s my idea of heaven--to have a great collection drop into
one’s hand, as success, or love, or any of the big shining things,
drop suddenly on some men. And I’ve had to worry along for nearly fifty
years, saving and paring, and haggling and intriguing, to get here a
bit and there a bit--and not one perfection in the lot! It’s enough to
poison a man’s life.”

The outbreak was so unlike Neave that I remember every word of it:
remember, too, saying in answer: “But, look here, Neave, you wouldn’t
take Daunt’s hands for yours, I imagine?”

He stared a moment and smiled. “Have all that, and grope my way through
it like a blind cave fish? What a question! But the sense that it’s
always the blind fish that live in that kind of aquarium is what makes
anarchists, sir!” He looked back from the corner of the square, where we
had paused while he delivered himself of this remarkable metaphor. “God,
I’d like to throw a bomb at that place, and be in at the looting!”

And with that, on the way home, he unpacked his grievance--pulled the
bandage off the wound, and showed me the ugly mark it had made on his
little white soul.

It wasn’t the struggling, stinting, self-denying that galled him--it was
the inadequacy of the result. It was, in short, the old tragedy of the
discrepancy between a man’s wants and his power to gratify them. Neave’s
taste was too exquisite for his means--was like some strange, delicate,
capricious animal, that he cherished and pampered and couldn’t satisfy.

“Don’t you know those little glittering lizards that die if they’re not
fed on some wonderful tropical fly? Well, my taste’s like that, with
one important difference--if it doesn’t get its fly, it simply turns and
feeds on me. Oh, it doesn’t die, my taste--worse luck! It gets larger
and stronger and more fastidious, and takes a bigger bite of me--that’s
all.”

That was all. Year by year, day by day, he had made himself into this
delicate register of perceptions and sensations--as far above the
ordinary human faculty of appreciation as some scientific registering
instrument is beyond the rough human senses--only to find that the
beauty which alone could satisfy him was unattainable--that he was never
to know the last deep identification which only possession can give. He
had trained himself in short, to feel, in the rare great thing--such
an utterance of beauty as the Daunt Diana, say--a hundred elements of
perfection, a hundred reasons why, imperceptible, inexplicable even,
to the average “artistic” sense; he had reached this point by a long
austere process of discrimination and rejection, the renewed great
refusals of the intelligence which perpetually asks more, which will
make no pact with its self of yesterday, and is never to be beguiled
from its purpose by the wiles of the next-best-thing. Oh, it’s a
poignant case, but not a common one; for the next-best-thing usually
wins...

You see, the worst of Neave’s state was the fact of his not being a mere
collector, even the collector raised to his highest pitch of efficiency.
The whole thing was blent in him with poetry--his imagination had
romanticized the acquisitive instinct, as the religious feeling of the
Middle Ages turned passion into love. And yet his could never be the
abstract enjoyment of the philosopher who says: “This or that object is
really mine because I’m capable of appreciating it.” Neave wanted what
he appreciated--wanted it with his touch and his sight as well as with
his imagination.

It was hardly a year afterward that, coming back from a long tour in
India, I picked up a London paper and read the amazing headline: “Mr.
Humphrey Neave buys the Daunt collection”... I rubbed my eyes and read
again. Yes, it could only be our old friend Humphrey. “An American
living in Rome ... one of our most discerning collectors”; there was no
mistaking the description. I clapped on my hat and bolted out to see the
first dealer I could find; and there I had the incredible details. Neave
had come into a fortune--two or three million dollars, amassed by an
uncle who had a corset-factory, and who had attained wealth as the
creator of the Mystic Super-straight. (Corset-factory sounds odd, by
the way, doesn’t it? One had fancied that the corset was a personal, a
highly specialized garment, more or less shaped on the form it was to
modify; but, after all, the Tanagras were all made from two or
three moulds--and so, I suppose, are the ladies who wear the Mystic
Super-straight.)

The uncle had a son, and Neave had never dreamed of seeing a penny of
the money; but the son died suddenly, and the father followed, leaving
a codicil that gave everything to our friend. Humphrey had to go out to
“realize” on the corset-factory; and his description of that ... Well,
he came back with his money in his pocket, and the day he landed old
Daunt went to smash. It all fitted in like a Chinese puzzle. I believe
Neave drove straight from Euston to Daunt House: at any rate, within two
months the collection was his, and at a price that made the trade sit
up. Trust old Daunt for that!

I was in Rome the following spring, and you’d better believe I looked
him up. A big porter glared at me from the door of the Palazzo Neave:
I had almost to produce my passport to get in. But that wasn’t Neave’s
fault--the poor fellow was so beset by people clamouring to see his
collection that he had to barricade himself, literally. When I had
mounted the state Scalone, and come on him, at the end of half a dozen
echoing saloons, in the farthest, smallest reduit of the vast suite, I
received the same welcome that he used to give us in his little den over
the wine shop.

“Well--so you’ve got her?” I said. For I’d caught sight of the Diana
in passing, against the bluish blur of an old verdure--just the
background for her poised loveliness. Only I rather wondered why she
wasn’t in the room where he sat.

He smiled. “Yes, I’ve got her,” he returned, more calmly than I had
expected.

“And all the rest of the loot?”

“Yes. I had to buy the lump.”

“Had to? But you wanted to, didn’t you? You used to say it was your
idea of heaven--to stretch out your hand and have a great ripe sphere of
beauty drop into it. I’m quoting your own words, by the way.”

Neave blinked and stroked his seedy moustache. “Oh, yes. I remember the
phrase. It’s true--it is the last luxury.” He paused, as if seeking a
pretext for his lack of warmth. “The thing that bothered me was having
to move. I couldn’t cram all the stuff into my old quarters.”

“Well, I should say not! This is rather a better setting.”

He got up. “Come and take a look round. I want to show you two or three
things--new attributions I’ve made. I’m doing the catalogue over.”

The interest of showing me the things seemed to dispel the vague apathy
I had felt in him. He grew keen again in detailing his redistribution of
values, and above all in convicting old Daunt and his advisers of their
repeated aberrations of judgment. “The miracle is that he should have
got such things, knowing as little as he did what he was getting. And
the egregious asses who bought for him were no better, were worse in
fact, since they had all sorts of humbugging wrong reasons for admiring
what old Daunt simply coveted because it belonged to some other rich
man.”

Never had Neave had so wondrous a field for the exercise of his
perfected faculty; and I saw then how in the real, the great collector’s
appreciations the keenest scientific perception is suffused with
imaginative sensibility, and how it’s to the latter undefinable quality
that in the last resort he trusts himself.

Nevertheless, I still felt the shadow of that hovering apathy, and he
knew I felt it, and was always breaking off to give me reasons for it.
For one thing, he wasn’t used to his new quarters--hated their bigness
and formality; then the requests to show his things drove him mad. “The
women--oh, the women!” he wailed, and interrupted himself to describe
a heavy-footed German Princess who had marched past his treasures as
if she were inspecting a cavalry regiment, applying an unmodulated
Mugneeficent to everything from the engraved gems to the Hercules
torso.

“Not that she was half as bad as the other kind,” he added, as if with
a last effort at optimism. “The kind who discriminate and say: ‘I’m not
sure if it’s Botticelli or Cellini I mean, but one of that school, at
any rate.’ And the worst of all are the ones who know--up to a certain
point: have the schools, and the dates and the jargon pat, and yet
wouldn’t know a Phidias if it stood where they hadn’t expected it.”

He had all my sympathy, poor Neave; yet these were trials inseparable
from the collector’s lot, and not always without their secret
compensations. Certainly they did not wholly explain my friend’s
attitude; and for a moment I wondered if it were due to some strange
disillusionment as to the quality of his treasures. But no! the Daunt
collection was almost above criticism; and as we passed from one object
to another I saw there was no mistaking the genuineness of Neave’s pride
in his possessions. The ripe sphere of beauty was his, and he had found
no flaw in it as yet...

A year later came the amazing announcement--the Daunt collection was for
sale. At first we all supposed it was a case of weeding out (though how
old Daunt would have raged at the thought of anybody’s weeding his
collection!) But no--the catalogue corrected that idea. Every stick and
stone was to go under the hammer. The news ran like wildfire from Rome
to Berlin, from Paris to London and New York. Was Neave ruined, then?
Wrong again--the dealers nosed that out in no time. He was simply
selling because he chose to sell; and in due time the things came up at
Christie’s.

But you may be sure the trade had found an answer to the riddle; and
the answer was that, on close inspection, Neave had found the collection
less impeccable than he had supposed. It was a preposterous answer--but
then there was no other. Neave, by this time, was pretty generally
recognized as having the subtlest flair of any collector in Europe,
and if he didn’t choose to keep the Daunt collection it could be only
because he had reason to think he could do better.

In a flash this report had gone the rounds and the buyers were on their
guard. I had run over to London to see the thing through, and it was the
queerest sale I ever was at. Some of the things held their own, but a
lot--and a few of the best among them--went for half their value. You
see, they’d been locked up in old Daunt’s house for nearly twenty years,
and hardly shown to any one, so that the whole younger generation of
dealers and collectors knew of them only by hearsay. Then you know
the effect of suggestion in such cases. The undefinable sense we were
speaking of is a ticklish instrument, easily thrown out of gear by
a sudden fall of temperature; and the sharpest experts grow shy and
self-distrustful when the cold current of depreciation touches them. The
sale was a slaughter--and when I saw the Daunt Diana fall at the wink of
a little third-rate brocanteur from Vienna I turned sick at the folly
of my kind.

For my part, I had never believed that Neave had sold the collection
because he’d “found it out”; and within a year my incredulity was
justified. As soon as the things were put in circulation they were known
for the marvels they are. There was hardly a poor bit in the lot; and
my wonder grew at Neave’s madness. All over Europe, dealers began to be
fighting for the spoils; and all kinds of stuff were palmed off on the
unsuspecting as fragments of the Daunt collection!

Meanwhile, what was Neave doing? For a long time I didn’t hear, and
chance kept me from returning to Rome. But one day, in Paris, I ran
across a dealer who had captured for a song one of the best Florentine
bronzes in the Daunt collection--a marvellous plaquette of
Donatello’s. I asked him what had become of it, and he said with a grin:
“I sold it the other day,” naming a price that staggered me.

“Ye gods! Who paid you that for it?”

His grin broadened, and he answered: “Neave.”

“ Neave? Humphrey Neave?”

“Didn’t you know he was buying back his things?”

“Nonsense!”

“He is, though. Not in his own name--but he’s doing it.”

And he was, do you know--and at prices that would have made a sane man
shudder! A few weeks later I ran across his tracks in London, where he
was trying to get hold of a Penicaud enamel--another of his scattered
treasures. Then I hunted him down at his hotel, and had it out with him.

“Look here, Neave, what are you up to?”

He wouldn’t tell me at first: stared and laughed and denied. But I
took him off to dine, and after dinner, while we smoked, I happened
to mention casually that I had a pull over the man who had the
Penicaud--and at that he broke down and confessed.

“Yes, I’m buying them back, Finney--it’s true.” He laughed nervously,
twitching his moustache. And then he let me have the story.

“You know how I’d hungered and thirsted for the real thing--you quoted
my own phrase to me once, about the ‘ripe sphere of beauty.’ So when I
got my money, and Daunt lost his, almost at the same moment, I saw the
hand of Providence in it. I knew that, even if I’d been younger, and had
more time, I could never hope, nowadays, to form such a collection as
that. There was the ripe sphere, within reach; and I took it. But when
I got it, and began to live with it, I found out my mistake. It was a
mariage de convenance--there’d been no wooing, no winning. Each of
my little old bits--the rubbish I chucked out to make room for Daunt’s
glories--had its own personal history, the drama of my relation to it,
of the discovery, the struggle, the capture, the first divine moment
of possession. There was a romantic secret between us. And then I
had absorbed its beauties one by one, they had become a part of
my imagination, they held me by a hundred threads of far-reaching
association. And suddenly I had expected to create this kind of
intense personal tie between myself and a roomful of new cold alien
presences--things staring at me vacantly from the depths of unknown
pasts! Can you fancy a more preposterous hope? Why, my other things, my
own things, had wooed me as passionately as I wooed them: there was a
certain little bronze, a little Venus Callipyge, who had drawn me,
drawn me, drawn me, imploring me to rescue her from her unspeakable
surroundings in a vulgar bric-a-brac shop at Biarritz, where she shrank
out of sight among sham Sevres and Dutch silver, as one has seen
certain women--rare, shy, exquisite--made almost invisible by the vulgar
splendours surrounding them. Well! that little Venus, who was just
a specious seventeenth century attempt at the ‘antique,’ but who had
penetrated me with her pleading grace, touched me by the easily
guessed story of her obscure, anonymous origin, was more to me
imaginatively--yes! more than the cold bought beauty of the Daunt
Diana...”

“The Daunt Diana!” I broke in. “Hold up, Neave--the Daunt Diana?”

He smiled contemptuously. “A professional beauty, my dear
fellow--expected every head to be turned when she came into a room.”

“Oh, Neave,” I groaned.

“Yes, I know. You’re thinking of what we felt that day we first saw her
in London. Many a poor devil has sold his soul as the result of such
a first sight! Well, I sold her instead. Do you want the truth about
her? Elle etait bete a pleurer.”

He laughed, and stood up with a little shrug of disenchantment.

“And so you’re impenitent?” I paused. “And yet you’re buying some of the
things back?”

Neave laughed again, ironically. “I knew you’d find me out and call
me to account. Well, yes: I’m buying back.” He stood before me half
sheepish, half defiant. “I’m buying back because there’s nothing else
as good in the market. And because I’ve a queer feeling that, this time,
they’ll be mine. But I’m ruining myself at the game!” he confessed.

It was true: Neave was ruining himself. And he’s gone on ruining himself
ever since, till now the job’s nearly done. Bit by bit, year by year,
he has gathered in his scattered treasures, at higher prices than the
dealers ever dreamed of getting. There are fabulous details in the story
of his quest. Now and then I ran across him, and was able to help him
recover a fragment; and it was wonderful to see his delight in the
moment of reunion. Finally, about two years ago, we met in Paris, and he
told me he had got back all the important pieces except the Diana.

“The Diana? But you told me you didn’t care for her.”

“Didn’t care?” He leaned across the restaurant table that divided us.
“Well, no, in a sense I didn’t. I wanted her to want me, you see; and
she didn’t then! Whereas now she’s crying to me to come to her. You know
where she is?” he broke off.

Yes, I knew: in the centre of Mrs. Willy P. Goldmark’s yellow and gold
drawing-room, under a thousand-candle-power chandelier, with reflectors
aimed at her from every point of the compass. I had seen her wincing and
shivering there in her outraged nudity at one of the Goldmark “crushes.”

“But you can’t get her, Neave,” I objected.

“No, I can’t get her,” he said.

Well, last month I was in Rome, for the first time in six or seven
years, and of course I looked about for Neave. The Palazzo Neave was let
to some rich Russians, and the splendid new porter didn’t know where the
proprietor lived. But I got on his trail easily enough, and it led me to
a strange old place in the Trastevere, an ancient crevassed black palace
turned tenement house, and fluttering with pauper clothes-lines. I found
Neave under the leads, in two or three cold rooms that smelt of the
cuisine of all his neighbours: a poor shrunken little figure, seedier
and shabbier than ever, yet more alive than when we had made the tour of
his collection in the Palazzo Neave.

The collection was around him again, not displayed in tall cabinets and
on marble tables, but huddled on shelves, perched on chairs, crammed in
corners, putting the gleam of bronze, the opalescence of old glass, the
pale lustre of marble, into all the angles of his low dim rooms. There
they were, the proud presences that had stared at him down the vistas of
Daunt House, and shone in cold transplanted beauty under his own painted
cornices: there they were, gathered in humble promiscuity about his bent
shabby figure, like superb wild creatures tamed to become the familiars
of some harmless old wizard.

As we went from bit to bit, as he lifted one piece after another, and
held it to the light of his low windows, I saw in his hands the same
tremor of sensation that I had noticed when he first examined the same
objects at Daunt House. All his life was in his finger-tips, and it
seemed to communicate life to the exquisite things he touched. But
you’ll think me infected by his mysticism if I tell you they gained new
beauty while he held them...

We went the rounds slowly and reverently; and then, when I supposed our
inspection was over, and was turning to take my leave, he opened a door
I had not noticed, and showed me into a slit of a room beyond. It was
a mere monastic cell, scarcely large enough for his narrow iron bed and
the chest which probably held his few clothes; but there, in a niche of
the bare wall, facing the foot of the bed--there stood the Daunt Diana.

I gasped at the sight and turned to him; and he looked back at me
without speaking.

“In the name of magic, Neave, how did you do it?”

He smiled as if from the depths of some secret rapture. “Call it magic,
if you like; but I ruined myself doing it,” he said.

I stared at him in silence, breathless with the madness and the
wonder of it; and suddenly, red to the ears, he flung out his boyish
confession. “I lied to you that day in London--the day I said I didn’t
care for her. I always cared--always worshipped--always wanted her. But
she wasn’t mine then, and I knew it, and she knew it ... and now at last
we understand each other.” He looked at me shyly, and then glanced about
the bare cold cell. “The setting isn’t worthy of her, I know; she
was meant for glories I can’t give her; but beautiful things, my dear
Finney, like beautiful spirits, live in houses not made with hands...”

His face shone with extraordinary sweetness as he spoke; and I saw he’d
got hold of the secret we’re all after. No, the setting isn’t worthy of
her, if you like. The rooms are as shabby and mean as those we used
to see him in years ago over the wine shop. I’m not sure they’re not
shabbier and meaner. But she rules there at last, she shines and hovers
there above him, and there at night, I doubt not, steals down from her
cloud to give him the Latmian kiss.




THE DEBT


I


YOU remember--it’s not so long ago--the talk there was about Dredge’s
“Arrival of the Fittest”? The talk has subsided, but the book of
course remains: stands up, in fact, as the tallest thing of its kind
since--well, I’d almost said since “The Origin of Species.”

I’m not wrong, at any rate, in calling it the most important
contribution yet made to the development of the Darwinian theory, or
rather to the solution of the awkward problem about which that theory
has had to make such a circuit. Dredge’s hypothesis will be contested,
may one day be disproved; but at least it has swept out of the way all
previous conjectures, including of course Lanfear’s magnificent attempt;
and for our generation of scientific investigators it will serve as the
first safe bridge across a murderous black whirlpool.

It’s all very interesting--there are few things more stirring to the
imagination than that sudden projection of the new hypothesis, light as
a cobweb and strong as steel, across the intellectual abyss; but, for
an idle observer of human motives, the other, the personal, side of
Dredge’s case is even more interesting and arresting.

Personal side? You didn’t know there was one? Pictured him simply as
a thinking machine, a highly specialized instrument of precision, the
result of a long series of “adaptations,” as his own jargon would put
it? Well, I don’t wonder--if you’ve met him. He does give the impression
of being something out of his own laboratory: a delicate scientific
instrument that reveals wonders to the initiated, and is absolutely
useless in an ordinary hand.

In his youth it was just the other way. I knew him twenty years ago, as
an awkward lout whom young Archie Lanfear had picked up at college, and
brought home for a visit. I happened to be staying at the Lanfears’ when
the boys arrived, and I shall never forget Dredge’s first appearance on
the scene. You know the Lanfears always lived very simply. That summer
they had gone to Buzzard’s Bay, in order that Professor Lanfear might be
near the Biological Station at Wood’s Holl, and they were picnicking in
a kind of sketchy bungalow without any attempt at elegance. But Galen
Dredge couldn’t have been more awe-struck if he’d been suddenly plunged
into a Fifth Avenue ball-room. He nearly knocked his shock head against
the low doorway, and in dodging this peril trod heavily on Mabel
Lanfear’s foot, and became hopelessly entangled in her mother’s
draperies--though how he managed it I never knew, for Mrs. Lanfear’s
dowdy muslins ran to no excess of train.

When the Professor himself came in it was ten times worse, and I saw
then that Dredge’s emotion was a tribute to the great man’s proximity.
That made the boy interesting, and I began to watch. Archie, always
enthusiastic but vague, had said: “Oh, he’s a tremendous chap--you’ll
see--” but I hadn’t expected to see quite so clearly. Lanfear’s vision,
of course, was sharper than mine; and the next morning he had carried
Dredge off to the Biological Station. And that was the way it began.

Dredge is the son of a Baptist minister. He comes from East Lethe, New
York State, and was working his way through college--waiting at White
Mountain hotels in summer--when Archie Lanfear ran across him. There
were eight children in the family, and the mother was an invalid. Dredge
never had a penny from his father after he was fourteen; but his mother
wanted him to be a scholar, and “kept at him,” as he put it, in the hope
of his going back to “teach school” at East Lethe. He developed slowly,
as the scientific mind generally does, and was still adrift about
himself and his tendencies when Archie took him down to Buzzard’s Bay.
But he had read Lanfear’s “Utility and Variation,” and had always been
a patient and curious observer of nature. And his first meeting with
Lanfear explained him to himself. It didn’t, however, enable him to
explain himself to others, and for a long time he remained, to all but
Lanfear, an object of incredulity and conjecture.

“ Why my husband wants him about--” poor Mrs. Lanfear, the kindest of
women, privately lamented to her friends; for Dredge, at that time--they
kept him all summer at the bungalow--had one of the most encumbering
personalities you can imagine. He was as inexpressive as he is to-day,
and yet oddly obtrusive: one of those uncomfortable presences whose
silence is an interruption.

The poor Lanfears almost died of him that summer, and the pity of it
was that he never suspected it, but continued to lavish on them a
floundering devotion as uncomfortable as the endearments of a dripping
dog--all out of gratitude for the Professor’s kindness! He was full,
in those days, of raw enthusiasms, which he forced on any one who
would listen when his first shyness had worn off. You can’t picture him
spouting sentimental poetry, can you? Yet I’ve seen him petrify a whole
group of Mrs. Lanfear’s callers by suddenly discharging on them, in the
strident drawl of Western New York, “Barbara Frietchie” or “The Queen of
the May.” His taste in literature was uniformly bad, but very definite,
and far more assertive than his views on biological questions. In his
scientific judgments he showed, even then, a remarkable temperance, a
precocious openness to the opposite view; but in literature he was a
furious propagandist, aggressive, disputatious, and extremely sensitive
to adverse opinion.

Lanfear, of course, had been struck from the first by his gift of
accurate observation, and by the fact that his eagerness to learn was
offset by his reluctance to conclude. I remember Lanfear’s telling me
that he had never known a lad of Dredge’s age who gave such promise of
uniting an aptitude for general ideas with the plodding patience of the
accumulator of facts. Of course when Lanfear talked like that of a young
biologist his fate was sealed. There could be no question of Dredge’s
going back to “teach school” at East Lethe. He must take a course in
biology at Columbia, spend his vacations at the Wood’s Holl laboratory,
and then, if possible, go to Germany for a year or two.

All this meant his virtual adoption by the Lanfears. Most of Lanfear’s
fortune went in helping young students to a start, and he devoted his
heaviest subsidies to Dredge.

“Dredge will be my biggest dividend--you’ll see!” he used to say, in the
chrysalis days when poor Galen was known to the world of science only
as a perpetual slouching presence in Mrs. Lanfear’s drawing-room. And
Dredge, it must be said, took his obligations simply, with that kind of
personal dignity, and quiet sense of his own worth, which in such cases
saves the beneficiary from abjectness. He seemed to trust himself as
fully as Lanfear trusted him.

The comic part of it was that his only idea of making what is known as
“a return” was to devote himself to the Professor’s family. When I hear
pretty women lamenting that they can’t coax Professor Dredge out of his
laboratory I remember Mabel Lanfear’s cry to me: “If Galen would only
keep away!” When Mabel fell on the ice and broke her leg, Galen walked
seven miles in a blizzard to get a surgeon; but if he did her this
service one day in the year, he bored her by being in the way for the
other three hundred and sixty-four. One would have imagined at that
time that he thought his perpetual presence the greatest gift he could
bestow; for, except on the occasion of his fetching the surgeon, I don’t
remember his taking any other way of expressing his gratitude.

In love with Mabel? Not a bit! But the queer thing was that he did
have a passion in those days--a blind, hopeless passion for Mrs.
Lanfear! Yes: I know what I’m saying. I mean Mrs. Lanfear, the
Professor’s wife, poor Mrs. Lanfear, with her tight hair and her loose
figure, her blameless brow and earnest eye-glasses, and her perpetual
attitude of mild misapprehension. I can see Dredge cowering, long and
many-jointed, in a diminutive drawing-room chair, one square-toed
shoe coiled round an exposed ankle, his knees clasped in a knot of
red knuckles, and his spectacles perpetually seeking Mrs. Lanfear’s
eye-glasses. I never knew if the poor lady was aware of the sentiment
she inspired, but her children observed it, and it provoked them to
irreverent mirth. Galen was the predestined butt of Mabel and
Archie; and secure in their mother’s virtuous obtuseness, and in her
worshipper’s timidity, they allowed themselves a latitude of banter
that sometimes turned their audience cold. Dredge meanwhile was going on
obstinately with his work. Now and then he had queer fits of idleness,
when he lapsed into a state of sulky inertia from which even Lanfear’s
admonitions could not rouse him. Once, just before an examination,
he suddenly went off to the Maine woods for two weeks, came back, and
failed to pass. I don’t know if his benefactor ever lost hope; but at
times his confidence must have been sorely strained. The queer part of
it was that when Dredge emerged from these eclipses he seemed keener and
more active than ever. His slowly growing intelligence probably needed
its periodical pauses of assimilation; and Lanfear was marvellously
patient.

At last Dredge finished his course and went to Germany; and when he came
back he was a new man--was, in fact, the Dredge we all know. He seemed
to have shed his blundering, encumbering personality, and come to
life as a disembodied intelligence. His fidelity to the Lanfears
was unchanged; but he showed it negatively, by his discretions and
abstentions. I have an idea that Mabel was less disposed to deride him,
might even have been induced to softer sentiments; but I doubt if Dredge
even noticed the change. As for his ex-goddess, he seemed to regard her
as a motherly household divinity, the guardian genius of the darning
needle; but on Professor Lanfear he looked with a deepening reverence.
If the rest of the family had diminished in his eyes, its head had grown
even greater.



II


FROM that day Dredge’s progress continued steadily. If not always
perceptible to the untrained eye, in Lanfear’s sight it never deviated,
and the great man began to associate Dredge with his work, and to lean
on him more and more. Lanfear’s health was already failing, and in my
confidential talks with him I saw how he counted on Galen Dredge to
continue and amplify his doctrine. If he did not describe the young man
as his predestined Huxley, it was because any such comparison between
himself and his great predecessors would have been repugnant to his
taste; but he evidently felt that it would be Dredge’s role to reveal
him to posterity. And the young man seemed at that time to take the same
view of his calling. When he was not busy about Lanfear’s work he was
recording their conversations with the diligence of a biographer and the
accuracy of a naturalist. Any attempt to question or minimize Lanfear’s
theories roused in his disciple the only flashes of wrath I have ever
seen a scientific discussion provoke in him. In defending his master
he became almost as intemperate as in the early period of his literary
passions.

Such filial dedication must have been all the more precious to Lanfear
because, about that time, it became evident that Archie would never
carry on his father’s work. He had begun brilliantly, you may remember,
by a little paper on Limulus Polyphemus that attracted a good deal
of notice when it appeared in the Central Blatt; but gradually his
zoological ardour yielded to an absorbing passion for the violin,
which was followed by a sudden plunge into physics. At present, after a
side-glance at the drama, I understand he’s devoting what is left of his
father’s money to archaeological explorations in Asia Minor.

“Archie’s got a delightful little mind,” Lanfear used to say to me,
rather wistfully, “but it’s just a highly polished surface held up to
the show as it passes. Dredge’s mind takes in only a bit at a time,
but the bit stays, and other bits are joined to it, in a hard mosaic of
fact, of which imagination weaves the pattern. I saw just how it would
be years ago, when my boy used to take my meaning in a flash, and answer
me with clever objections, while Galen disappeared into one of his
fathomless silences, and then came to the surface like a dripping
retriever, a long way beyond Archie’s objections, and with an answer to
them in his mouth.”

It was about this time that the crowning satisfaction of Lanfear’s
career came to him: I mean, of course, John Weyman’s gift to Columbia
of the Lanfear Laboratory, and the founding, in connection with it, of a
chair of Experimental Evolution. Weyman had always taken an interest in
Lanfear’s work, but no one had supposed that his interest would express
itself so magnificently. The honour came to Lanfear at a time when he
was fighting an accumulation of troubles: failing health, the
money difficulties resulting from his irrepressible generosity, his
disappointment about Archie’s career, and perhaps also the persistent
attacks of the new school of German zoologists.

“If I hadn’t Galen I should feel the game was up,” he said to me once,
in a fit of half-real, half-mocking despondency. “But he’ll do what I
haven’t time to do myself, and what my boy can’t do for me.”

That meant that he would answer the critics, and triumphantly affirm
Lanfear’s theory, which had been rudely shaken, but not displaced.

“A scientific hypothesis lasts till there’s something else to put in
its place. People who want to get across a river will use the old bridge
till the new one’s built. And I don’t see any one who’s particularly
anxious, in this case, to take a contract for the new one,” Lanfear
ended; and I remember answering with a laugh: “Not while Horatius Dredge
holds the other.”

It was generally known that Lanfear had not long to live, and the
Laboratory was hardly opened before the question of his successor in
the chair of Experimental Evolution began to be a matter of public
discussion. It was conceded that whoever followed him ought to be a
man of achieved reputation, some one carrying, as the French say, a
considerable “baggage.” At the same time, even Lanfear’s critics felt
that he should be succeeded by a man who held his views and would
continue his teaching. This was not in itself a difficulty, for German
criticism had so far been mainly negative, and there were plenty of
good men who, while they questioned the permanent validity of Lanfear’s
conclusions, were yet ready to accept them for their provisional
usefulness. And then there was the added inducement of the Laboratory!
The Columbia Professor of Experimental Evolution has at his disposal the
most complete instrument of biological research that modern ingenuity
has yet produced; and it’s not only in theology or politics que Paris
vaut bien une messe! There was no trouble about finding a candidate;
but the whole thing turned on Lanfear’s decision, since it was tacitly
understood that, by Weyman’s wish, he was to select his successor. And
what a cry there was when he selected Galen Dredge!

Not in the scientific world, though. The specialists were beginning to
know about Dredge. His remarkable paper on Sexual Dimorphism had been
translated into several languages, and a furious polemic had broken out
over it. When a young fellow can get the big men fighting over him his
future is pretty well assured. But Dredge was only thirty-four, and some
people seemed to feel that there was a kind of deflected nepotism in
Lanfear’s choice.

“If he could choose Dredge he might as well have chosen his own son,”
 I’ve heard it said; and the irony was that Archie--will you believe
it?--actually thought so himself! But Lanfear had Weyman behind him,
and when the end came the Faculty at once appointed Galen Dredge to the
chair of Experimental Evolution.

For the first two years things went quietly, along accustomed
lines. Dredge simply continued the course which Lanfear’s death had
interrupted. He lectured well even then, with a persuasive simplicity
surprising in the slow, inarticulate creature one knew him for. But
haven’t you noticed that certain personalities reveal themselves only
in the more impersonal relations of life? It’s as if they woke only
to collective contacts, and the single consciousness were an unmeaning
fragment to them.

If there was anything to criticize in that first part of the course,
it was the avoidance of general ideas, of those brilliant rockets of
conjecture that Lanfear’s students were used to seeing him fling
across the darkness. I remember once saying this to Archie, who, having
recovered from his absurd disappointment, had returned to his old
allegiance to Dredge.

“Oh, that’s Galen all over. He doesn’t want to jump into the ring till
he has a big swishing knock-down argument in his fist. He’ll wait twenty
years if he has to. That’s his strength: he’s never afraid to wait.”

I thought this shrewd of Archie, as well as generous; and I saw the
wisdom of Dredge’s course. As Lanfear himself had said, his theory was
safe enough till somebody found a more attractive one; and before
that day Dredge would probably have accumulated sufficient proof to
crystallize the fluid hypothesis.



III


THE third winter I was off collecting in Central America, and didn’t
get back till Dredge’s course had been going for a couple of months.
The very day I turned up in town Archie Lanfear descended on me with a
summons from his mother. I was wanted at once at a family council.

I found the Lanfear ladies in a state of incoherent distress, which
Archie’s own indignation hardly made more intelligible. But gradually
I put together their fragmentary charges, and learned that Dredge’s
lectures were turning into an organized assault on his master’s
doctrine.

“It amounts to just this,” Archie said, controlling his women with the
masterful gesture of the weak man. “Galen has simply turned round and
betrayed my father.”

“Just for a handful of silver he left us,” Mabel sobbed in parenthesis,
while Mrs. Lanfear tearfully cited Hamlet.
