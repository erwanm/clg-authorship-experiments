" Poor crazy thing ! " said everybody, which 
was precisely what she meant that everybody 
should say. 

Now, there lived in Snapberry a Mr. Short, a 
tobacco-grower, and an agent of the Colonisa 
tion Society; in whose service he lectured 
through his nose, whenever he could find an 
audience; and by his self-denying labour and 


missionary spirit, earned, it was said, exactly 
his own salary. To the house of Mr. Shorf 
the negro went with mischief in her eyes. She 
asked for supper, and a shelter from the storm. 
She had heard of his interest in the coloured 
race, and felt sure that he would help her. 

" I help those that help themselves," replied 
Mr. Short, who had been called away from a 
cigar, and felt cross. " It 's poor benevolence 
to help wandering beggars, black or white. If 
you had appreciated your privileges and gone 
to Liberia, where you belong, in that last colony 
we sent out free of expense, to roam in their 
ancestral forests, you wouldn't be here begging 
to-day, I suppose, would you? " 

She meekly replied that she supposed not. 

" Well, then, don't come to me," said Mr. 
Short, shutting the door. " I 've done my duty 
by you. If you won't go to a happier clime 
and roam in your ancestral forests, you must 
take the consequences." 

A little distance beyond the amiable Mr. 
Short 's something quite unexpected happened. 



Deacon Popkins, the Overseer of the Poor, 
was out toiling through the drifts with horse and 
sleigh to the Office ; and Deacon Popkins, peer 
ing from under his fur cap, saw the wretched 
figure of the negro blown about by the wind. 

" Hallo ! " shouted he, reining up. 

"Hud 'd ye, massa?" said the figure, hurry 
ing on. 

" Here, stop there ! Whar ye goin this sort 
of night, that style ? I 'm Town Overseer, and 
you jes tell me your business if you please." 

"I I don know," said Gypsy, unwilling to 
manufacture a story even in her disguise. "I 
thank ye kindly, sir, but I 'm done used to 
taking care of myself." 

" Worse for you if you are, then," said Dea 
con Popkins, climbing briskly from his sleigh. 
"I 'm Town Overseer, I say, and it 's my busi 
ness to pick up vagrants, and see em safe in the 
Poor-us ; and as for findin you froze in a drift 
somewhars to-morrow morning, it would be on- 
convenient to all parties ; so, if you please, mum, 

you may jes step in, an we 'll go long now." 

Here was a charming little combination ol 
circumstances, verily ! Gypsy began to have 
a suspicion that her fun was turning into most 
uncomfortable earnest, and, moreover, that she 
had been doing a very imprudent thing. Not 
seeing exactly how to help herself, and hoping 
that a chance for escaping without detection 
would occur, she climbed into the sleigh reluc 
tantly, and Deacon Popkins carried her straight 
to the Poor-house. 

Once fairly in the dreary entry, consigned 
for the night as a " nigger vagrant," to the care 
of a vinegar-faced matron, with Deacon Pop- 
kins rapidly taking his departure, Gypsy felt, 
that her hour had come. 

"Deacon Popkins?" she said faintly. He 
did not hear ; he was already in the sleigh. 

" Deacon Popkins ! " 

"Well, what 's the matter now?" said the 
Deacon, standing impatiently with the reins in 
his hand. 

" I 'm not a negro, and I think I 'll go 
home now." 


The deacon laughed loudly. 

" Poor crazy critter, you ! Not a nigger ! 
Ha, ha, ha ! " and he was driving off. Gypsy 
broke away from the detaining hands of the 
sour matron, flew down the steps, and out into 
the snow after him. 

" Deacon Popkins, I really can't stay in a 
Poor-house all night, and I 'm not any more of 
a negro now than you are." 

" Waal, mum, if you ain't a nigger, you re 
the blackest white gal ever I see; that 's all 
lang, Billy!" 

" Shake hands and see ! " cried Gypsy in 
despair, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. 
She held out her corked hand all wet with 
snow, and the deacon drew off his mitten and 
shook it violently. It would have been difficult, 
after this proceeding, to say which hand was 
the blacker. 

"I vum ! " said the deacon, slowly. 

" Told you so ! " cried Gypsy, determined to 
make sure of the matter. " See here ! " Up 
there, a handful of snow upon her forehead, 

over her cheeks, across her chin, down her 
neck. The effect was absolutely indescribable. 

" There, now ! I 'm nothing but Gypsy 
Breynton blacked up. Don't you see?" 

She turned her face, all streaks of white, and 
rivers of black, full upon him, and the Town 
Overseer sat back in his sleigh and laughed till 
-the matron thought that he had a stroke of 
apoplexy, and came running out with a pitcher 
of half-frozen water, which she poured all over 
him. 

Gypsy found her way back to the Crescent 
safely, and Dolly let her in at the back door 
just as the tea-bell rang. 

But the next day the whole town had the 
story, and in due time it came to Mrs. Mc- 
Munn. 

She could not keep sober long enough to 
give Gypsy the scolding that she richly de 
served, but Miss Ayre kindly made up the 
deficiency. 




ANE BRUCE is developing." 

Mary Blunt said this, standing with 
her poplin skirt half folded over 
her arm. 
" Developing? " 

" Yes, all round. (I think she mended this 
trimming for me really very well, didn't she?) 
She always was one of your goodish kind, and 
helped you shell popped-corn, and was sorry 
when you were sick, and wouldn't tickle you at 
devotions, and all that ; but don't you see how 
she 's spruced up and bloomed out lately? 
She rushes round and laughs, and gets ac 
quainted like anybody else ; and she is actually 
witty when she sets about it. Besides, her 

dresses didn't use to fit and now she really 


takes pains to come out in decent "style like 
other girls not exactly 'd la Paris, to be sure ; 
Jane doesn't go into that sort of thing; but it 
is an improvement, an improvement. I must 
say, if you re going to have good people, I like 
that kind. I don't like to see a girl spend a 
hundred dollars on lace trimming, and then go 
and pray in it at a missionary meeting. Not 
but that I had rather have the velvet, but 
then " 

" Yes," said Gypsy. " Yes, Jane is a nice 
girl. I don't see as much of her, though, if she 
is my room-mate, as I do of ever so many 
others. I don't know why. I 'm almost always 
with Maude. You see she is nt half as pretty, 
and stylish, and graceful, and sweet, and loving, 
as Maude Clare. But then," with a little sigh, 
" I don't suppose Maude is good." 

" Not exactly, no," said Mary, with a short 
laugh. 

"Now, Jane, for instance, wouldn't laugh," 
pursued Gypsy, glad to change the subject, " at 
that little performance the other morning." 




"Oh, it was you, was it? I suspected as 
much." 

" Yes ; don't you tell, though. I went," 
Gypsy 's eyes began to twinkle at the memory, 

"I went into the music-room early to prac 
tise, and I was tired of Tarn O Shanter, and 
something put it into my head, I 'm sure I don't 
know what and I didn't mean to do anything 
bad but I thought how funny to write it and 
pin it up on the mantelpiece before they all 
came in to prayers. Then, you know, it 
happened that they two came in together so nicely 

Mrs. McMunn was sick, and Miss A. took 
her place ; and they marched in arm-in arm, 
and saw it in the great letters Oh dear ! 

" New and interesting Chemical Experiments! 
Union of Air and Gas! Fearful Explosion* 
looked for. 

" The chaplain turned as red as a beet. 
Don't you want some flag- root?" 

" Thank you. I know it, and Miss Ayre was
just as white and angry, all except her chin; 
that is always red." 



They do really say they are engaged, any 
way; Jack Delancey found her sitting in his 
lap in the front parlour she says. Poor Mr, 
Goss! He can't get over it; and he goes 
about so meekly, and blushes every time he 
sees a girl. Altogether, he is the most sub 
limely uncomfortable mortal I ever looked at. 
Peanuts? Why! why not?" 

" Why, I 'm sorry," said Gypsy, the twink 
ling dying away. "I never meant anything 
but fun. I should like to tell him so. What 
do you suppose Jane said about it, though?" 

" Oh ! that you had broken the Ten Com 
mandments, perhaps." 

" No. She just said she shouldn't think it 
would pay." 

"Just like Jane. Have a cream-cake?" 

" No, thank you. If you will let me have 
your little hammer you said I might? I 'll 
go back now and fix my trunk. I shan't get 
packed till midnight at this rate, and neithef 
will you, if you don't stop eating." 

She stopped in the doorway, thinking. 



" I wonder if It did pay. I wonder if it ever 
pays." 

Mary was too much engaged in emptying 
her pockets of cooky crumbs to make answer; 
so Gypsy went away to her own room. 

The end of the long winter term had come, 
and six ecstatic weeks of vacation were at 
hand. 

Gypsy stuffed her stove with compositions, 
packed her trunks, and went home. 

And no sooner was she there, as it seemed, 
than it was time to turn about and go back 
again. 

Jane Bruce had spent her vacation in having 
a severe influenza, and was not strong enough 
to come back at the beginning of the term. 

Maude Clare 's sister was going to be married, 
and Maude was to stay over the wedding. 

Gypsy, left alone, invited Josephine Courtis 
to share her room with her till Jane or Maude 
came back. 

" Oh, my good gracious ! " cried Miss 
Delancey. "Why, she sha n t! Why, I wouldn't 



be hired to sleep alone one night, for any 
money you could give me. My sister Belle 
always has to sleep with me at home ; and if 
she is away visitiag, I make mother come ; or 
else I have one of the servants sleep on the 
couch. Why, I should die of fright before 
morning ! " 

"Fright! What can you find to be afraid 
of, I should like to know? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; robbers, and ghosts, 
and spiritual rappings, and fifty things. I have 
an aunt who saw her candlestick walk right 
out into the air off the mantelpiece, one night, 
and how do I know but that I should see mine 
walking, if I slept alone ! I always cover my 
head up in the clothes, anyway, and I always 
make Josephine sleep the front side; don't I, 
Jo?" 

"Were?" said contemptuous Gypsy, slowly. 
" If I enjoyed being an infant, I 'd be an infant, 
but it would be a good while before I would 
boast of it." 

" It is very nice to talk," said Jacqueline, 






colouring, " but I should like to know what 
you want of my room-mate if you re not afraid 
just as much as I am." 

" I want her because she is funny, and good 
company to have round, and I never was afraid 
to sleep alone, since I dispensed with nurses ! 
If you won't believe me, I 'll go and spend a 
night up garret, for I should be ashamed to 
have anybody think I was afraid." 

Now, the garret at the Golden Crescent was 
a dismal place; dark with cobwebs, frowning 
with shadows, ghostly with old quilts and cast- 
off garments ; moreover, the wind shrieked, 
with an extremely unpleasant sound, down the 
huge old-fashioned chimneys. Therefore, in 
credulous Jacqueline screamed at Gypsy 's pro 
posal, and said that it made her cold so much 
as to think of it. 

Gypsy made herself up a bed under the 
eaves, and at nine o'clock that night, went up, 
a stout-faced, white-robed little figure, dragging 
a pillow, and slept there, true to her word, till 
morning. 


Jacqueline went up herself at six o'clock 
to wake her, and be sure that there was no 
hoax about it. 

The girls rushed to Gypsy 's room while she 
was dressing, to hear about it. 

" How did you ever dare to? " 

" Weren't you awfully scared? " 

" Didn't you lie awake all night?" 

"And didn't you once think you saw a 
ghost?" 

" Or a candlestick walking? " 

" Oh, I wouldn't have done it for anything ! ** 

Nor I ! " 

" Think of it ! " 

" Such a quantity of rats and spiders ! Why, 
I 'm as afraid of a mouse as I can be." 

" Well," said Jacqueline, finishing the chorus, 
" it is very well for you ; you don't mind thun 
der-showers, and you didn't scream when we 
upset on that sleigh-ride, and you re not afraid 
of robbers, but I am nervous. I am so timid 
mother says I am the most timid child she 

ever had." 


It required all Gypsy 's politeness to keep 
out of her face and tones the little flash of 
scorn with which she heard this remark. 

"Jacqueline Delancey, you really talk as 
if you thought it were a pretty thing to be 
timid ! " 

And Jacqueline looked very much as if she 
thought so, which was more. 

" I really don't see," persisted Gypsy, "I 
really don't see why a girl should be a goose, 
because she is a girl. Now, if my brother Tom 
were here, and had slept up garret, would you 
ask him if he was afraid, or would you think it 
an insult? " 

" Of course I shouldn't ask him ! " 

" Well, then, if it would be unmanly in him 
to be afraid of nothing, I say it is unwomanly 
in me to be afraid of nothing, and what 's more 
I won't be ! Now, where did I leave that hair 
brush?" 

Mademoiselle, when she heard of the matter, 
proposed to sleep with Jacqueline, in order that 
Jo might be free to make the visit to Sky 



Parlour. The offer must have been quite a little 
sacrifice on the part of the French Teacher, for 
Miss Delancey was anything but an agreeable 
room-mate, had always been one of her most 
troublesome scholars, and had barely treated 
her with civility. It was evident that Made 
moiselle had taken a fancy to Gypsy. 

So Josephine " struck tents," as she said, 
with Gypsy, for the time in which her room 
mate should be away. The time became a 
week, became a fortnight, and Jane had not 
come, nor Maude. 

Put two such impulsive, out-spoken girls as 
Jo and Gypsy in the same room, on equal foot 
ing of privilege, for fourteen days, and they are 
apt at the end to understand each other about 
as well as they would in fourteen years. Had 
Maude Clare, instead of Jo, been subjected to 
the test, Gypsy would not have been so long in 
discovering some things that she did discover 
about her friend. Josephine was one of those 
people whose faults and virtues, equally, make 

more impression on one the more one knows 


of them : the faults were not easily " put tip 
with : " the virtues did not lessen through 
familiarity. 

She was, unmistakably, what Gypsy had pro 
nounced her, " good company." She was 
well, and strong, and happy; never had head 
aches or " blues ; " never was homesick, never 
cried or moped ; she overflowed with fun and 
jest, nine-tenths of it girl 's pointless chatter, 
one-tenth genuine wit. Moreover, she had a 
good large Western heart, that took in with 
especial fervour the person with whom she 
happened to be at any particular moment. A 
generous room-mate she certainly was; she 
never growled at making the bed ; she took her 
turn in dusting the room; she would kindly 
volunteer to read magazine stories aloud to 
one while one was studying Virgil, and of her 
taffy one had invariably the lion 's share. 

But good company is not always the best 
If, the more Gypsy saw of her, the more she 
liked her for her kind heart, the more hei 

rough nature grated. 



Jo was loud of laughter and noisy of speech , 
she shouted on the street ; she sung at the 
window when boys were going by; she would 
carelessly break a rule, and carelessly be im 
pertinent to a teacher; she was not of nice 
culture in matters of etiquette or personal 
habit ; she would jest wittily, sometimes blas 
phemously, at things of sacred name. 

Now, none of this could hurt Gypsy. Im 
pulsive and unceremonious though she was, 
from roughness, from open breaches of the 
laws of courtesy and refinement, nature and 
training led her to revolt ; and she believed 
with simple and confiding reverence in the God 
to whom she " talked " every night after that 
other talk with her mother. 

But there was one respect in which Josephine 
Courtis did her positive harm ; and as I be 
lieve that there are few merry, mimicking 
girls like Gypsy who do not fall at some 
time or other into the same trap, I shall men 
tion it, at risk of being accused of delaying, 
by an interminable sermon, that masquerade 
with which I so inappropriately headed this 
chapter. 

Jo inclined to " being a boy." She liked to 
be called Jo. She liked better to be called! 
Courtis. She was sorry that she was made a 
woman. She wished she were a man. She 
liked to wear noisy boots and round turbans. 
She affected paper collars and broad neckties, 
and turned back the lappets of her sacque. 
She always walked with her hands in her 
pockets. She whistled well, and whistled a 
great deal. She talked slang. 

When Gypsy had roomed with her about a 
week, it was observed that she had cut over her 
hat into a turban; that she was whistling a 
good deal ; that she had a mannish little way of 
opening and shutting doors, splashing through 
mud-puddles, giving her orders at the stores. 
She learned to touch her hat to the girls when 
she met them in the street, and she liked to 
offer them her arm at a concert. In fact, it 
was the little hoyden of a few years ago, com 
ing out in new and more dignified shape. 



And as for slang, she scarcely talked any* 
thing else. Josephine was Courtis, invariably. 
The absent Jane was appropriately referred to 
as Bruce. McMunn and the Amiable Ayre 
were the established cognomens of her teach 
ers, while poor Mr. Goss, whose Christian name 
the girls had discovered on a card in one of 
Miss Ayre 's books, was designated respectfully 
as the Lovely Leonard. 

A bad lesson was a " flunk," or a " fizzle," 
or a " slump." A fine recitation was a " rush." 
The meetings of The Evergreen Sisters were 
" bums." A party was a " spree." A little 
difficulty with a teacher was a " row." A 
room-mate was a " chum." Pleasant girls 
were " good fellows," &c., &c., &c., in variety 
without end. 

Now, as Mrs. Breynton knew from week to 
week just about what Gypsy was living, she 
very soon noticed the growth of this doubtful 
accomplishment, and when at last she received 
a letter written from beginning to end in this 
style, 




Chum and I got into a regular row eating 
dates in one of McMunn 's classes, and I think 
it 's a bothering bore to have to cram so on 
Roman History. I don't like to be scolded 
better than the next man, and wouldn't it be 
jolly if vacation were here? " 

Gypsy had by the next mail the following : - 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, I return your 
letter, which, owing to my long habit of corre 
sponding in English, I am unable to translate. 
A vocabulary perhaps would be of service, if 
you have one to spare. 

If you have given up all intention &gt;f becom 
ing a young lady, I can undoubtedly find a 
school where they will make a boy of you to 
order; perhaps you would enjoy yourself at 
Andover or Exeter; or shall it be Harvard at 
once? Please give me early notice of yout 
preference, that I may have time to look 
about. 

There might, to be sure, be some little incoiv 
venience to me in the arrangement, as you hap 



pen to be my only daughter, and three sons 
would be a good many, but still 

Affectionately, 

MOTHER 

To which Gypsy made answer: 

"Why, mother! Why, Mother Breynton! 
Why, I wouldn't be a boy for anything in the 
world. I think they re horrid ! " 

And quickly back came the reply, 

" Well then, my dear, don't try to be a 
boy. You remember the poor little swan who 
couldn't be a duck? Everybody laughed at 
her, you know. 

" If you decide to be a woman, be a woman. 
It may be as brave and strong and bright 
and learned and independent a woman as it 
chooses, but it must not degrade itself by aping 
something which it was never destined to be, 
and never can be, try as hard as it may. 

" Furthermore, my dear, I really don't see 
how I could have a daughter of mine grow uji 

other than a lady. 


"A lady never talks slang. And these habits 
which you are forming just now, will cling to 
you like burs, long after school-days are over. 
So, shall this be the end of my refractory duck 
ling 's career? " 

I believe that it was. 

Lou Armstrong was talking about a masquer 
ade, in these days. These masquerades held 
on holiday evenings, in which the girls were 
their own hostesses and cavaliers, and to which 
the lady teachers were invited as spectators 
were hereditary amusements at the Golden 
Crescent, handed down from class to class. It 
should be observed, however, that the term 
" masquerade " was a title more honorary than 
appropriate. Nobody masked but the homely 
girls. It was not becoming. 

" We can go into the Music Room," said 
Lou, " and let me see ; who will play for 
us?" 

" Mr. Schleiermacher," suggested Josephine. 
" No, indeed ! We don't want a man look- 



ing on. I guess Emma Colchett will play. 
Let us get it up in style, and have a subscrip 
tion for oysters Dolly will cook them for a 
pair of cuffs. As for characters and dresses, 
I 've thought of some that are mag. Queen 
Marie. Jeanne 'd Arc. Leicester, and his 



Queen. Zenobia " 

" Yes, and Sappho." 

" And King Lear, and that old what 's his 
name? John Burns? who fought in the old 
white hat at Gettysburg, or somewhere." 

" Good ! Then flower-girls and gypsies to 
fill up, of course Josephine, you must be 
Leicester, and I 'll be Bess." 

" Lou Armstrong, you know nobody else can 
he Sappho. Put on ivy-leaves, and take off 
your waterfall. Let Mary Blunt be Queen 
Bess; her hair is just the colour." 

"And Gypsy? Gypsy Breynton? What 
shall she be?" 

" Oh, let me be a page, a funny little page 
with a cap on. I will wait on Queen Marie, I 
believe." 



Maude Clare had been written to about the 
masquerade, and if she came back in time, she 
was to be Marie. Not a little flattered that 
she should be chosen as the " Bonnie Queen," 
Maude thought that she should be back in time. 

As it chanced, she and Jane came in the 
same train; and they came just after supper, 
the very night of the masquerade. 

Jane looked tired and pale, when she came 
upstairs. Gypsy gave her one hurried kiss, 
and bounded away to Maude Clare, to fondle 
and pet and squeeze her, to scream over her, 
and laugh at her, and question her, and pinch 
her in a bewilderment of joy. Never had 
Maude so fascinated her by her little graceful 
ways and caresses; never had she looked so 
white and pink and pretty, so stylish, or so 
dear, as after their long separation. 

" And you have come just in time to be 
Queen Marie, my pretty Queen Marie ! Made 
your dress at home? Oh, splendid ! Real lace 
collar, and pearls in your hair? Oh, Maude, 
you will be a queen ! " 



" I shall have a blossom of a page, I think, 
mignon. See here, Gypsy, who do you think 
has come back? Somebody." 

" Not that old " 

" Yes. Ben Sizer." 

" But I thought he went back to College 
long ago." 

" So he did ; but he is here again. He came 
on in the cars with me." 

" Why ! how did he know what train you 
were coming in? " 

" Oh, I dropped him a line," said Maude, 
carelessly. 

" They say," observed Gypsy, " that he was 
rusticated from Harvard, and that 's how he 
came here." 

" I don't believe it ! " said Maude, indig 
nantly. " He says he comes for his health. I 
suppose he studied too hard." 

The idea of Mr. Benjamin Sizer studying too 
hard so amused Gypsy that she hurried away 
to dress, without venturing on any further 
remarks. 



A very pretty little page she made, when that 
dressing was over. She had compounded a 
graceful tunic out of a broad crimson silk scarf 
and sash, with trimmings of gilt paper. The 
full, Oriental-looking trousers, which came 
down closely about her ankles, were (but no 
body would have thought it) made of old white 
cotton-cloth, covered with figures of every 
colour cut from silk and cashmere, and sewed 
on. She wore white kid gloves with scarlet 
gauntlets, and carried a riding-whip. Her hair 
was caught up on top of her head out of sight, 
the short side brushed out around her temples, 
and over it was the jauntiest little blue velvet 
cap with silver tassels. This was Jacqueline 
Delancey 's skating-cap; rather showy for a 
skating-cap, but very suitable for Queen 
Marie 's page. 

As Gypsy was hurrying to the music-room 
in the little flush and excitement which comes 
from the consciousness that one looks pretty 
and that one is going to have a very good time, 
she passed by Phcebe Hand 's room. The dooi 



tood partly open. Miss Ayrc had gone al 
ready to the masquerade, and Phoebe sat there 
alone.
