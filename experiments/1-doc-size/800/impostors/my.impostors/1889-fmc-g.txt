had no need of spending long hours in reverie and contemplation, 
as people do who are not used to their surroundings, or who com- 
pare their present with their past. Constant occupation had 
become a part of her being, and unceasing small activity in house- 
hold matters the condition of her life. Heaven knows, there was 
enough to do between making and mending everything she wore, 
keeping in order even the small part of the gigantic building 
which she and her mother inhabited, cultivating as best she 
could the plot of ground in the castle yard which was all the land 



 

left to her, the last of her name, and, in the midst of all this 
manual labour, in maintaining that prescribed amount of appearance, from which she had never been allowed to deviate since she 
had been a little child. A spotless perfection of neatness was 
indeed the only luxury left within reach of the two ladies, and 
for that one available satisfaction there was no trouble they 
would not cheerfully undergo. But these manifold household 
labours did not vulgarise Hilda's character. If she enjoyed the 
luxury of Greifenstein during her half-yearly visits, it was not 
because she disliked or despised her own home life. She was too 
thoroughly conscious of the inevitable to groan over her lot, she 
was too strong in mind and body to desire luxurious idleness, and 
she never imagined that a woman could find occupation except in 
household duties. Her whole existence had made her so simple 
that she could never have comprehended that complicated state of 
mind which is so delightful to society. 

Something of nature's own freshness, too, had been infused into 
the young girl's veins, refreshing and renewing the life in that 
old blood of which she was the last descendant. Blue eyes are 
rarely very bright. Hilda's seemed to have a special vitality of 
their own, which gave the impression that they must shine in the 
dark as some crystals do for a few seconds when they have been 
long exposed to the sun. They were of that rare type which 
appear to sparkle even when not seen directly, not merely reflecting 
the light as a placid pool reflects it, but making it dance and 
change as sunshine does in falling water. Hilda's hair was 
yellow, and yellow hair is often lustreless as the pine dust in the 
woods ; but hers glowed, as it w r ere by its own colour, without 
reflection, out of the very abundance of vitality. Her features 
were delicate and aquiline, but were saved from any look of deficient 
strength by that perfection of evenly -distributed colour which 
comes only from matchless health and untainted blood, combined 
with a rare strength in the action of the heart. Hilda possessed 
one of those highly-favoured organisations which nature occasionally produces as normal types of what humanity should be. Such 
people bring with them a radiance that nothing can extinguish, 
not even extreme old age. Their beauty may not be of the 
highest type, but their vitality is irresistibly attractive, and 
spreads to their surroundings, undiminished by any effort they 
make. 

When Hilda was told that if she and Greif loved each other 
they should marry, she was far less surprised than her mother 
had been when old Greifenstein had made his proposal. It seemed 



 

strange to the baroness that her daughter should not even blush 
a little on learning the news. But Hilda saw no reason for 
blushing and did not feel in the least disconcerted. To her it all 
seemed perfectly natural. She had always loved Greif, ever 
since she could remember anything. Why should he not love 
her? And if they loved each other, they would of course be 
married in due time. It was but the fulfilment of her life, after 
all. There was surely nothing in the idea to cause her any 
emotion. Did not Heaven dispose everything in the best possible 
way, and was not this the best possible thing that could happen 
Did the hawk mate with the wren, or the wild boar with the doe 
But the baroness did not understand. She asked Hilda if she 
should be very unhappy if Greif died, or if he married some 
one else. 

' God will not be so unkind/ answered the young girl simply. 

Frau von Sigmundskron was silent. It was clear that Hilda, 
in her innocence, had never expected anything else, but her mother 
trembled to think of what might happen if that simple faith were 
rudely disappointed. It was characteristic of the devoted mother 
that she thought of her child's heart, and not of the worldly 
difference to Hilda between single life at Sigmundskron and 
wedded life at Greifenstein, between starvation and plenty, extreme 
poverty and the state of enjoying all that money could give. It 
was long before she could comprehend what had passed in Hilda's 
mind, or the process of reasoning by which the young girl had reached 
such a calm certainty of anticipation. When she at last saw that 
it was an extremely simple matter, she realised how completely 
her daughter had been shut off from the world since her birth. 
At first she had doubted the reality of the girl's quiet manner in 
the circumstances, but she soon discovered that Hilda behaved 
during Greif's visits exactly as she had always done, meeting him 
gladly, parting from him regretfully, speaking with him as though 
there were no difference in their relations in the present, nor were 
to be in the future, excepting that Greif would always be present, 
instead of only coming from time to time. She knew that Greif 
himself was far from looking at the matter with such supreme 
calm. She saw the colour come and go in his fair face in a way 
that showed a constant emotion, and she feared lest such a very 
susceptible young man as he appeared to be should be entrapped, 
when away from home, by the designing mother, of whom every 
other mother sees the type in the background of her thoughts. 

But Greif did not fall a victim to any such schemes. If Hilda 
had at all resembled most girls of her age, he could have compared 



 

her with them, and the comparison would not have been to her 
advantage. She could not have possessed their cheap accomplish- 
ments, their knowledge of waltzing, or their intimate acquaintance 
with their neighbours' affairs. She could not have put on their 
sentimentality with men, nor their cynicism with each other. She 
could not imitate their glances and she did not imitate their dress. 
She was a creature apart from them all. Deeply imbued as he 
was with all the prejudices of an exclusive caste, Greif could 
not have looked upon Hilda as he did, if she had been a peasant's 
child, even though she had been herself in all other respects. 
There was that in her position which appealed to the romanticism 
of his nature. The noble but unfortunate maiden, the last of an 
ancient race, dwelling in dignified retirement in her half-ruined 
ancestral home, was vastly more interesting than any equally well- 
born girl could have been, who chanced to be rich enough to be 
marched into society as a matrimonial investment for young men 
of her station. But it was precisely because Hilda possessed that 
one point in common with all such eligible young ladies that 
Greif regarded her with a romantic devotion he could never have 
felt for a village Gretchen. His pride in her nobility was indeed 
far less than his love for herself, but it made for that love a 
rampart against love's deadliest enemy, which is ridicule. He 
certainly did not tell himself so. He would have thought it an 
insult to Hilda to worship her for anything but her own self; but 
he was none the less aware that the pedestal upon which his idol 
stood was strong enough to withstand any assault. This being 
certain, it was the very impossibility of any further comparison 
that attracted him most. She was unlike any one whom he 
met, or was ever likely to meet, and his imagination invested her 
with many exceptional attributes, most of which she undoubtedly 
possessed in one degree or another. 

Each time he returned and left the noisy train and the smart 
modern railway station behind him, to plunge into the silent 
forest, he felt more strongly that his real sympathies all lay 
between Greifenstein and Sigmundskron, and that his visits to the 
world were only disturbing dreams. They must be renewed from 
time to time, at ever-increasing intervals, but the real peace of his 
life awaited him in his home. He, too, like Hilda, was a child of 
the woods, and felt that the trees, the foaming streams and the 
changeless crags were all parts of himself, to lose which would be 
like forfeiting a limb of his body or a sense of his intelligence. 
The baroness need not have been afraid lest he should wander 
about the world to forget Sigmundskron or Hilda. Nature had 



 

made him constant, and circumstances had made him happy in his 
own place. 

And so for years the lives of all these persons had run on, until 
the time was approaching when Greif and Hilda were to be 
married, and great changes were to be made at Sigmundskron. 
Greif had come home for the last time but one, and his next 
return would be final. During months and years the baroness and 
her daughter had been slowly preparing for the great event. The 
most unheard-of economies had been imagined and carried out in 
the attempt to give Hilda a little outfit for her wedding, just 
enough to hide the desperate poverty in which they had lived. 
Many a long winter's evening had the two ladies spun the fine 
flax by the smouldering fire ; many a long day had Hilda and 
Berbel spent at the primitive loom in the sunny room of the south 
tower ; through many a summer's noon had the long breadths of 
fine linen lain bleaching on the clean grey stone of the ramparts, 
watered by the faithful servant's careful hand. Endless had been 
the thought expended before cutting into each piece of the precious 
material ; endless the labour lavished upon the fine embroideries 
by Hilda herself, upon the minute stitching by her brave-hearted 
mother. But the work had progressed well, and the finished 
garments that lay amidst bundles of sweet-smelling dried herbs in 
the great old press would have done credit to the spinning and 
weaving and handiwork of skilled craftsmen. It was fortunate 
that there had been time for it all, else Hilda would have made 
but a poor figure on the great day. 

As for Berbel she believed that the forest itself had helped 
them, when she saw all that had been accomplished and remembered how she had bought the flax pound by pound at the 
market. Though a great share in the joint success was due to her 
own patient industry, the result seemed so fine as compared with 
the humble beginnings that she was much inclined to thank the 
Heinzelmannchen and their ' brownies ' for the most part of it all. 
The baroness thanked Providence, and Hilda thought it was all 
due to her love for Greif. Perhaps they were all three right, and 
possibly each shared in some measure the views of the other two. 
At least so far as the gnomes are concerned, most people who have 
lived long in forests and solitary places have discovered that their 
work, if they like it, is performed with a rapidity and skill which 
is marvellous in their own eyes, and if you do not call the little 
gentleman who comes at night and helps you by the name of 
Rltbezahl, you may call him the Spirit of Peace. But as long as 
you receive him kindly and give him his due it matters very 



 

little how you christen him, for he is an affectionate spirit and 
loves those who love him for himself, and does their work for 
them, or makes them think he does, which, in fact, is just the 
same. 

Unfortunately there are other spirits as busy as he in the world, 
and he has a way of taking himself off at the slightest alarm, 
which is often very distressing to those who love him ; and some 
of those other spirits had chosen for their abode the Castle of 
Greifenstein and for their companions the persons who dwelt 
there. The unforeseen plays a very great part in our lives ; for if 
it did not, we should most of us know exactly what to do at the 
right moment, and should consequently approach perfection at an 
unnatural rate. While Greif and his father were slowly ascending 
the hill towards their home, while Frau von Greifenstein was 
looking at herself in her mirror and wondering whether she had 
not thrown away her youth after all, while Berbel was weaving 
and Hilda embroidering and the old baroness stitching steadily 
along the folded linen while all these people were thus quietly 
and peaceably engaged, an event was brewing which was destined 
to produce some very remarkable results. And lest the justifica- 
tion of ordinary possibility should be required by the sceptical 
hereafter, I will at once state that the greater part of what follows 
is a matter of history, well known to many living persons ; and 
that in writing it down I wish it to be understood that I am sub- 
mitting to the judgment of humanity a strange case which actually 
occurred within this century, rather than constructing from my 
own imagination a mere romance for the delectation of such as will 
take the trouble to read it. 



CHAPTER III 

' OH ! Is it not too delightful to see my dear, dear cousins ! ' 
screamed Frau von Greifenstein, throwing herself into the arms of 
the pale and quiet baroness. ' And dear Hilda, too ! Ach, ist es 
nicht herzig ! Is it not too sweet ! ' 

She was wonderfully arrayed in an exceedingly youthful costume, 
short enough to display her thin, elderly ankles, and adorned with 
many flying ribbands and furbelows. An impossibly high garden 
hat crowned her faded head, allowing certain rather unattached- 
looking ringlets of colourless blonde hair to stray about her cheeks. 
She made one think of a butterfly, no longer young, but attempting 
to keep up the illusions of spring. Hilda and her mother smiled 
and returned the salutation in their quiet way. 

'And how have you been at Sigmundskron ? continued the 
sprightly lady. * Do you know ? It would be my dream to live 
at Sigmundskron ! So romantic, so solitary, so deliciously poetic ! 
It is no wonder that you look like Cinderella and the fairy god- 
mother ! I am sure they both lived at Sigmundskron and Greif 
will be the Prince Charmant with his Puss in Boots quite a 
Lohengrin in fact dear me ! I am afraid I am mixing them up 
those old German myths are so confusing, and I am quite beside 
myself with the joy of seeing you ! ' 

Greifenstein stood looking on, not a muscle of his face betraying 
the slightest emotion at his wife's incoherent speech. But Greif 
had turned away and appeared to be examining one of the guns 
that stood in a rack against the wall. The meeting had taken 
place in the great hall, and he was glad that there was something 
to look at, for he did not know whether he was most amused by 
his mother's chatter, or ashamed of the ridiculous figure she made. 
The impression was certainly a painful one, and he had not attained 
to his father's grim indifference, for he was not obliged to assist 
daily at such scenes. He could not help comparing Hilda's mother 



with his own, and he inwardly determined that when he was 
married he would take up his abode at Sigmundskron during the 
greater part of the year. 

Hilda looked at her hostess and wondered whether all women 
of the world were like Frau von Greifenstein. The situation did 
not last long, however, and half an hour later she found herself 
sitting beside Greif on a block of stone by the ruined Hunger-Thurm. 

' At last ! ' exclaimed Greif, with a sigh of satisfaction. ' Is 
there anything so tiresome as the sight of affectionate greetings ? ' 

' Greif ' Hilda paused, as though reconsidering the question 

she was about to ask. 

' Yes what is it, sweetheart ? ' 

' When we are married, I must love your mother, must I not ? ' 

' Oh yes no doubt,' answered the young man with a puzzled 
expression. ' At least, I suppose you must try.' 

' But I mean, if I do not love her as much as my own mother, 
will it be very wrong ? ' 

' No, not so much, of course/ 

' Do you love her, Greif? ' 

' Oh yes,' replied Greif cheerfully. ' Not as I love you ' 

'Or your father?' 

' That is different, a man feels more sympathy for his father, 
because he is a man.' 

' But I am not a man 

'No, and you are not my mother either. That is again 
different, you see.' 

' Greif you do not love your mother at all ! ' exclaimed Hilda, 
turning her bright eyes to his. But he looked away and his face 
grew grave. 

'Please do not say that to me, dear,' he answered quietly. 
' Let us talk of other things.' 

' Does it pain you ? I am sorry. I asked you because well, 
I wanted to know if it was exactly my duty because you see, I 
do not think I ever could, quite, as I ought to. You are not 
angry ? ' 

' No, darling. Fquite understand. It will be enough if you behave to her as you do now. Besides, I was going to propose something, if your mother will agree to it. When we are married, 
we might live at Sigmundskron.' 

' Oh ! Greif, are you in earnest ? ' 

'Yes. Why not ]' 

' You do not know what a place it is ! ' exclaimed Hilda with 
an uneasy laugh. She had visions of her husband discovering the 



 

utter desolation of the old castle, but at the same time she felt a 
sudden wild desire to see it all restored and furnished and kept up 
as it should be. 

' Yes, I know. But there are many reasons why I should like 
it. Of course it has gone to ruin, more or less, and there would 
be something to be done.' 

' Something ! ' cried Hilda. * Everything ! The great rooms are 
perfectly desolate, no furniture, hardly any glass in the windows. 
We are so poor, Greif ! ' 

' But I can put panes into the frames and get some furniture. 
We need not have so much at first.' 

'But you will have to get everything, everything. You are 
used to so much here.' 

' I should not need much if I had you/ answered Greif looking 
at her, as the colour rose in his own face. 

'I do not know. Perhaps not.' 

I should be happy with you in a woodman's hut,' said Greif 
earnestly. 

' Perhaps,' replied Hilda a little doubtfully. 

 There is no "perhaps." I am quite sure of it.' 

' How can you be sure ? ' asked the young girl turning suddenly 
and laying her hands upon his arm. ' Did not your father say the 
same no, forgive me ! I will not speak of that. Oh Greif ! 
What is love really the meaning of it, the true spirit of it 
Why does it sometimes last and sometimes not *? Are all men so 
different one from another, and women too ? Is it not like religion, 
that when you once believe you always believe ? I have thought 
about it so much, and I cannot understand it. And yet I know I 
love you. Why can I not understand what I feel ? Is it very 
foolish of me ? Am I less clever than other girls ? ' 

' No, indeed ! ' Greif drew her to him, and kissed her cheek. 
Her colour never changed. With innocent simplicity she turned 
her face and kissed him in return. 

'Then why is it  ?' she asked. 'And none of my books tell me 
what it means, though I have read them all. Can you not tell 
me, you who know so much ? What is the use of all your studies 
and your universities, if you cannot tell me what it is I feel, what 
love is . ' 

'Does love need explanation? What does the meaning matter, 
when one has it ? ' 

' Ah, you may say that of anything. Would the air be sweeter, 
if I knew what it was ? Would the storm be louder, or grander, 
or more angry, if I knew what made it ? And besides, I do know, 



 

for I have learned about storms in my books. But it is not the 
same thing. Love is not part of nature, I am sure. It is a part 
of the soul. But then, why should it sometimes change? The 
soul does not change, for it is eternal.' 

' But true love does not change either ' 

'And yet people seem to think it is true, until it changes,' 
argued Hilda. * There must be something by which one can tell 
whether it is true or not.' 

' One must not be too logical with love, any more than with 
religion.' 

' Religion ? Why, that is the most logical thing we know any- 
thing about ! ' 

' And yet people have differed very much in their opinions of 
it,' said Greif with a smile. 

' Is it not logical that good people should go to heaven and bad 
people to hell ? ' inquired Hilda calmly. ' Religion would be 
illogical if it taught that sinners should all be saved and saints 
burnt in everlasting fire. How can you say it is not logical ? ' 

'It certainly cannot be said if one takes your view,' Greif 
answered, laughing. ' But then, if you look at love in the same 
way, you get the same result. People who love each other are 
happy and people who quarrel are not.' 

' Yes ; but then, love does not only consist in not quarrelling.' 

' Nor religion in not being a sinner but I am not sure 
Greif interrupted himself. ' Perhaps that is just what religion 
means.' 

' Then why cannot love mean something quite as simple ?' 

' It seems simple enough to me. So long as we are everything 
to each other we shall understand it quite enough.' 

' Just so long 

' And that means for ever.' 

' How do you know, unless you have some knowledge by which 
you can tell whether your love is true or not ? ' 

' Why not yours, sweetheart ? ' 

' Oh ! I know myself well enough. I shall never change. 
But you you might 

' Do you not believe me ? ' 

'Yes, I suppose so. But it always comes to that in the end, 
whenever we talk about it, and I am never any nearer to knowing 
what love is, after all ! ' 

The young girl rested her chin upon her hand and looked wist- 
fully through the trees, as though she wished and half expected 
that some wise fairy would come flitting through the shadow and 



 

the patches of sunshine to tell her the meaning of her love, of her 
life, of all she felt, of all she did not feel. She read in books that 
maidens blushed when the man they loved spoke to them, that 
their hearts beat fast and that their hands grew cold simple 
expressions out of simple and almost childish tales. But none of 
these things happened to her. Why should they ? Had she not 
expected to meet Greif that day ? Why should she feel surprise, 
or fear, or whatever it was, that made the hearts of maidens in 
fiction behave so oddly ? He was very handsome, as he sat there 
glancing sideways at her, and she could see him distinctly, though 
she seemed to be looking at the trees. But that was no reason 
why she should turn red and pale, and tremble as though she had 
done something very wrong. It was all quite right, and quite 
sanctioned. She had nothing to say to Greif, nothing to think 
about him, that her mother might not have heard or known. 

' I am no nearer to knowing,' she repeated after a long interval 
of silence. 

' And I am no nearer to the wish to know,' answered Greif, 
clasping his brown hands over his knee and gazing at her from 
under the brim of his straw hat. ' You are a strange girl, Hilda,' 
he added presently, and something in his face showed that her 
singularity pleased him and satisfied his pride. 

' Am I Then why do you like me ? Or do you like me be- 
cause I am strange ? ' 

' I wish I were a poet,' observed Greif instead of answering her. 
' I would write such things about you as have never been written 
about any woman. However, I suppose you would never read my 
verses.' 

' Oh yes ! ' laughed Hilda. ' Especially if mamma told me 
that they belonged to the "best German epoch." But I should 
not like them 

'You do not like poetry in general, I believe.' 

'It always seems to me a very unnatural way of expressing 
oneself,' answered Hilda thoughtfully. 'Why should a man go 
out of his way to put what he wants to say into a certain shape ? 
What necessity is there for putting in a word more than is needed, 
or for pinching oneself so as to cut one out that would be useful 
for the sense, just because by doing that you can make everything 
fit a certain mould and sound mechanical ta ra tatatata ta 
turn turn ! " Ich weiss nicht was soil es bedeuten," and all the 
rest of it. There is something wrong. That poem is very sad 
and romantic in idei, and yet you always sing it when you are 
particularly happy.' 




'Most people do,' said Greif, smiling at the truth of the 
observation. 

' Then what is there in poetry ? Does " I love you " sound 
sweeter if it is followed by a mechanical " ta ra ta ra ta turn " of 
words quite unnecessary to the thought, and which you only hear 
because they jingle after you, as your spurs do, when you have 
been riding and are on foot, at every step you take ? ' 

' Schlagend ! ' laughed Greif. ' An annihilating argument ! I 
will never think of writing verses any more, I promise you.' 

' No. Don't/ answered Hilda emphatically. * Unless you feel 
that you cannot love me in plain language in prose,' she added, 
with a glance of her sparkling eyes. 

' Verse would be better than nothing, then ? ' 

' Than nothing anything would be better than that.' 

Greif fell to wondering whether her serious tone meant all that 
he understood by it, and he asked himself whether her calm, 
passionless affection were really what he in his heart called love. 
She felt no emotion, like his own. She could pronounce the words 
' I love ' again and again without a tremor of the voice or a 
change in the even shading of her radiant colour. It was possible 
that she only thought of him as a brother, as a part of the world 
she lived in, as something dearer than her mother because nearer 
to her own age. It was possible that if she had been in the world 
she might have seen some man whose mere presence could make 
her feel all she had never felt. It was conceivable that she should 
have fallen into this sisterly sort of affection in the absence of any 
person who might have awakened her real sensibilities. Greif s 
masculine nature was not satisfied, for it craved a more active 
response, as a lad watches for the widening ripples when he has 
dropped a pebble into a placid pool. An irresistible desire to 
know the truth overcame Greif. 

' Are you quite sure of yourself, sweetheart ? ' he asked softly. 

' Of what ? ' 

' That you really love me. Do you know 

Before he could finish the question Hilda was looking into his 
face, with an expression he had never seen before. He stopped 
short, surprised at the effect of his own words. Hilda was very 
angry, perhaps for the first time in her whole life. The brightness 
of her eyes almost startled him, and there was a slight contraction 
of the brows that gave her features a look of amazing power. 
Greif even fancied that, for once, her cheek was a shade paler than 
usual. 

' You do not know what you say/ she answered very slowly. 



 

'Darling you have misunderstood me!' exclaimed Greif in 
distress. ' I did not mean to say 

' You asked me if I were sure that I really loved you,' said 
Hilda very gravely. 'You must be mad, but those were your 
words.' 

' Hear me, sweetheart ! I only asked because you see, you are 
so different from other women ! How can I explain ! ' 

' So you have had experience of others ! ' She spoke coldly and 
her voice had an incisive ring in it that wounded him as a knife. 
He was too inexperienced to know what to do, and he instinctively 
assumed that look of injured superiority which it is the peculiar 
privilege of women to wear in such cases, and which, in a man, 
exasperates them beyond measure. 

' My dear,' said Greif, ' you have quite misunderstood me. I 
will explain the situation.' 

' It is necessary,' answered Hilda, looking at the trees. 

' In the first place, you must remember what we were saying, 
or rather what you were saying a little while ago. You wanted 
an explanation of the nature of love. Now that made me think 
that you had never felt what I feel 

' I have not had your experience,' observed Hilda. 

' But I have not had any experience either ! ' exclaimed Greif, 
suddenly breaking down in his dissertation. 

'Then how do you know that I am so different from other 
women ? ' was the inexorable retort. 

' I have seen other women, and talked with them 

'About love?' 

'No about the weather,' answered Greif, annoyed at her 
persistence. 

' And were their views about the weather so very different from 
mine ? ' inquired the young girl, pushing him to the end of the 
situation. 

' Perhaps.' 

' You do not seem sure. I wish you would explain yourself, as 
you promised to do ! ' 

' Then you must not interrupt me at every word.' 

' Was I interrupting ? I thought my questions might help you. 
Go on.' 

' I only mean to say that I never heard of a woman who 
wanted an explanation of her feelings when she was in love. And 
then I wondered whether your love was like mine, and as I am 
very sure, I supposed that if you felt differently you could not be 
so sure as I. That is all. Why are you so angry ? ' 




'You know very well why I am angry. That is only an 
excuse.' 

' If you are going to argue in that way -' Greif shrugged his 
shoulders and said nothing more. Hilda seemed to be collecting 
her thoughts. 

' You evidently doubt me/ she said at last, speaking quietly. 
' It is the first time. You have tried to defend your question, and 
you have not succeeded. All that you can tell me is that I am 
different from other women with whom you have talked. I know 
that as well as you do, though I have never seen them. It is 
quite possible that the difference may come from my education, or 
want of education. In that case, if you are going to be ashamed 
of me, when I am your wife, because I know less than the girls 
you have seen in towns and such places why then, go away and 
marry one of them. She will feel as you expect her to feel, and 
you will be satisfied.' 

' Hilda ! ' 

'I mean- what I say. But there may be something else. The 
difference may be there because I have not learned the same out- 
ward manners as the city people, because I do not laugh when 
they would laugh, cry when they would cry, act as they would 
act. I do not know half the things they like, or do, or say, 
but from what I have read I fancy that they are not at all simple, 
nor straightforward in their likings and dislikes, nor in their speech 
either. I do not even know whether I look like them, nor whether if 
I went to their places they would not take me for some strange 
wild animal. I make my own clothes. I have heard that they 
spend for one bit of dress as much as my mother and I spend in a 
whole year upon everything. I suppose they do, for your mother 
must wear what people wear in towns, and her things must cost a 
great deal. I think I should feel uncomfortable in them, but if 
we are married I will wear what you please 

' How can you say such things ' 

' I am only going over the points in which I am different from 
other women. That is one of them. Then I believe they learn 
all sorts of tricks they can play on the piano I have never seen 
one, for it is the only thing you have not got at Greifenstein, 
they draw and paint, they talk in more than one language, whereas 
I only know what little French my mother could teach me, they 
sing from written music for that matter, I can sing without, 
which I suppose ought to be harder. But they can do all those 
little things, which I suppose amuse you, and of which I cannot 
do one. Perhaps those accomplishments, or tricks, change them 



 

so that they feel more than I do. ' But I do not believe it. If I 
had the chance of learning them I would do it, to please you. It 
would not make me love you any more. I believe that we, who 
think of few people because we know few, think of them more and 
more lovingly. But if I took trouble to please you, it would show 
you how much I love you. Perhaps perhaps that is what you 
really want, that I should say more, act more, make a greater 
show. Is that it, after a!U' 

Her mood had changed while she was speaking, perhaps by 
the enumeration of her points of inferiority. She turned her 
bright eyes towards Greif with a look of curiosity, as though 
wondering whether she had hit the mark, as indeed she had, by a 
pure accident. 

' It cannot be that I cannot be such a fool !' Greif exclaimed 
with all the resentment of a man who has been found out in his 
selfishness. 

' I should not think any the worse of you,' said Hilda. ' It is 
I who have been foolish not to guess it before. How should you 
understand that I love you, merely because I say good morning 
and kiss you, and good evening and kiss you, and talk about the 
weather and your mother's ribbands ! There must be something 
more. And yet I feel that if you married some one else, I should 
be very unhappy and should perhaps die. Why not ? There would 
not be anything to live for. Why can I not find some way of 
letting you know how I love you ? There must be ways of showing 
it but I have thought of everything I can do for you, and it is 
so little, for you have everything. Only Greif, you must not 
doubt that I love you because I have no way of showing it or if 
you do 

' Forgive me, Hilda I never doubted 

' Oh, but you did, you did,' answered Hilda with great emphasis, 
and in a tone which showed how deeply the words had wounded 
her. ' It is natural, I suppose, and then, is it not better that I 
should know it ? It is of no use to hide such things. I should have 
felt it, if you had not told me.' 

It was not in Hilda's nature to shed tears easily, for she had 
been exposed to so few emotions in her life that she had never 
acquired the habit of weeping. But there was something in her 
expression that moved Greif more than a fit of sobbing could have 
done. There was an evident strength in her resentment, even 
though it showed itself in temperate words, which indicated a 
greater solidity of character than the young man had given her 
credit for. He had not realised that a love developed by natural 



and slow degrees, without a shadow of opposition, could be deeper 
and more enduring than the spasmodic passion that springs up 
amidst the unstable surroundings of the world, ill nourished by an 
uncertain alternation of hope and fear, and prone to consume itself 
in the heat of its own expression. The one is about as different 
from the other as the slowly moving glacier of the Alps is from 
the gaudily decorated and artificially frozen concoction of the ice- 
cream vendor. 

'I am very sorry I said it,' returned Greif penitently, He 
took her passive hand in his, hoping to make the peace as quickly 
as he had broken it, but she did not return the pressure of his 
fingers. 

' So am I,' she answered thoughtfully. ' I was angry at first. 
I do not think I am angry any more, but I cannot forget it, 
because, in some way or other, it must be my fault. Forgive you 
There is nothing to forgive, dear. Why should one not speak out 
what is in one's heart ? It would be a sort of lie, if one did not. 
I would tell you at once, if I thought you did not love me ' 

Greif smiled. 

' Ah Hilda ! Since we have been sitting here, you have told 
me you thought I might change do you not remember ? Was 
what I said so much worse than that ? ' 

' Of course it was,' she answered. ' Ever so much worse.' 

Thereupon Greif meditated for some moments upon the nature 
of woman, and to tell the truth he was not so far advanced as to 
have no need for such study. Finding no suitable answer to what 
she had said, he could think of nothing better than to press her 
hand gently and stroke her long straight fingers. Presently, the 
pressure was returned and Greif congratulated himself, with some 
reason, upon having discovered the only plausible argument within 
his reach. But his wisdom did not go so far as to keep him
