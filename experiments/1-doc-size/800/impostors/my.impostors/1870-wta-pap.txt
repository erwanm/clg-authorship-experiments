"Does that young man get two dollars a day?" I asked, pointing to a boy
of eighteen or nineteen, who was putting on his overalls in front of
the building.

"No; that's Morgan Blair. He came down from Illinois last spring. I
give him a dollar a day. He doesn't know the business, and that is more
than he is worth. You will work with Conant."

Calling one of the workmen who answered to this name, he directed him
to take me under his charge. The frame of the building was up, and we
were to be engaged in boarding it.

"Come along, my boy; we will take the stiffening out of you in about
two hours," said Conant, as he led the way to the stage.

"All right; when I break down I will give you leave to bury me."

"Do you think you can lift your end of a board?"

"I can; and lift both ends, if need be."

"You have got the pluck, but it's hard work for a boy."

"I will keep my side up."

Mr. Clinch had given me a hammer and a bag of nails, which I tied
around my body, as I saw the other men do. I was strong and tough, and
could easily handle any lumber used on the work. I carried my end of
each board up to the frame, and I am sure I drove as many nails as
Conant. But I will not describe the process by which the building was
erected. I did my full share of the work until noon.

"Don't you want to go to bed now?" asked Conant, when we knocked off.

"Go to bed! No. Why should I?"

"Ain't you tuckered out?"

"No, not at all; I don't feel quite so fresh as I did this morning, but
I shall be all right again when I get my dinner."

"You are a tough 'un, then."

"Well, Conant, how does Phil get along?" asked Mr. Clinch, as we came
down from the stage.

"Tip-top; he has done a man's work--twice as much as Morgan," replied
Conant, with more magnanimity than I had given him credit for.

"All right. Phil, I am glad you are getting along well. It will be
easier work when we get the building covered."

In going home to dinner, I went pretty near the steamboat levee.
A boat had just come in, and I wanted to know if it had come from
the Missouri, for I was very anxious to hear from the Gracewoods. I
hastened towards the landing. I met the passengers as they came up, and
on inquiry of one of them learned that the steamer was from St. Joe,
but she had not stopped at Delaware City; so of course the Gracewoods
could not have come in her.

I was about to leave, when I perceived Mr. Leonidas Lynchpinne coming
across the levee. I thought that I had business with him, and I
hastened to resume the relations with him which had been interrupted at
Leavenworth.




  CHAPTER IX.

  IN WHICH PHIL MEETS A SEEDY GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF FARRINGFORD.


Mr. Leonidas Lynchpinne, otherwise Lynch, had a small valise in his
hand, and was sauntering leisurely along, as though earth had no sorrow
for him, and he was not responsible in St. Louis for an infamous act
done in Leavenworth. I wanted my money; in fact, I needed it. For
Mrs. Greenough's remarks had assured me that my wardrobe was entirely
inadequate to the requirements of civilized life.

"How do you do, Mr. Leonidas Lynchpinne?" I began, making towards him.

He glanced at me very contemptuously, and continued on his way. I had
expected to astonish and confound him, but the result did not realize
my anticipations. It was decidedly a look of disdain that he bestowed
upon me, which I thought was adding insult to injury. So far I was
disgusted with his conduct; but I had no idea of abandoning the purpose
I had in view.

"I want to see you, Mr. Lynchpinne," I continued, following him, and
taking position at his side.

"Who are you?" he demanded, halting, and giving me another contemptuous
look.

"Don't you know me, Mr. Lynchpinne?"

"My name is not Lynchpinne."

"Lynch, then. Don't you know me?"

"No."

"Yes, you do."

"You impertinent puppy!"

"O, yes! All that's very pretty, but I want my money."

"What money? What do you mean, you saucy young cub?"

"Perhaps I am saucy; so was Nathan when he said to David,'Thou art the
man!' and that's just what I say to you."

"Go about your business," said he, angrily, as he resumed his walk.

"My business, just now, is to get back the money you stole from me;
and I'm going to stick to it, too."

"Stole! How dare you use that word to me?"

"Because I believe in speaking the truth, even when it is not pleasant
to do so."

"Clear out, and don't come near me again."

"Hand over my money, and I shall be glad to do so."

"If you don't leave, I'll call a policeman."

"I wish you would. I should like to tell him my story. If you don't
call one, I shall, as soon as I see him. I'll follow you till your legs
or mine give out."

"You evidently take me for some other person, boy," said he, halting on
Front Street, perhaps afraid that we might meet a policeman--a thing
which has been known to happen.

"No, I don't; I take you for Lynch, the man that stole my money, and I
want a policeman to take you for that, too."

"See here, boy; I can't be annoyed in this manner in the public
street," he replied, in a kind of confidential tone. "What do you want
of me?"

"I told you what I wanted--my money."

"I know nothing about your money. If you want to see me, come to the
Planters' Hotel at eight o'clock this evening, and I will meet you."

"I think not. I don't mean to lose sight of you, Lynch."

"If you don't clear out, I'll chastise you on the ground for an
impudent puppy."

"Well, sir, when you get ready to chastise, you begin," I replied, as I
glanced at his slender form. "If I don't keep up my end, you can have
the money you stole."

"How dare you--"

But he checked himself, for two or three persons had already stopped;
and their example was so contagious, in a populous city, that there was
danger of collecting a crowd, to which my sensitive friend seemed to
have very strong constitutional objections. He moved on, and I followed
him into Market Street. I was anxious to meet a policeman, that I might
state my case to him, and invoke his aid; but the officers, justifying
all the traditions of their craft, were somewhere else, because they
were wanted in Market Street.

Lynch quickened his pace, and turned into Fourth Street; but I kept
close to his heels till we were near the Planters' Hotel. I concluded
that he was going to this grand establishment, and that he expected to
shake me off within its sumptuous walls. I did not believe he would,
though the want of an officer was a sore inconvenience to me. Just
as he was about to cross the street, a shabby genteel and very seedy
gentleman confronted him.

"How are you, Lynch?" exclaimed the dilapidated individual, extending
his hand.

"How do you do, Farringford?" replied Lynch.

Farringford! This must be the decayed steamboat owner of whom Lynch had
before spoken to me. He was apparently about forty-five years of age,
and he looked as though the world had used him very roughly.

"I'm glad to see you, Lynch," said Farringford. "I'm always glad to see
an old friend. I'm hard up, and I want to borrow a dollar."

Lynch took two half dollars in silver from his pocket. Perhaps the
present generation of young people never saw a half dollar; but it
is true that there was a time when such a coin was in general use!
He handed the money to the seedy gentleman, and then said something
to him in a whisper, which I could not hear, though I had planked
myself close by the side of the villain. Lynch then turned to cross the
street, and I started to follow him.

  [Illustration: PHIL MEETS LEONIDAS LYNCHPINNE. Page 100.]

"See here, my lad," said Farringford, grasping me by the arm.

"Let me alone!" I cried, struggling to escape, fearful that I should
lose sight of Lynch.

"Hold still, my lad. I only want to speak to you," replied Farringford,
in cheerful tones, though he did not relax his grasp. "Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you. I've known you ever since you were a baby."

"Known me?"

I was startled by his words, for they seemed to have some relation to
the mystery of my being.

"Certainly I have, Phil."

"Do you know me?" I demanded, forgetting, for the moment, all about
Lynch and my hard money.

"Known you from your babyhood, my lad," said he, glancing towards the
hotel.

This act reminded me of my business again. I turned my face towards the
hotel. Lynch had disappeared.

"That's all, Phil; you can go now," said Farringford, laughing.

"What do you mean, sir?"

"That's all, my lad. I only stopped you to prevent you from following
my friend."

"You said you knew me."

"Never saw you or heard of you before in my life," chuckled he,
evidently pleased at the trick he had played upon me.

I left him, and rushed into the hotel. I looked for Lynch in all the
public rooms, but I could not find him. I inquired at the office for
him, and the clerks answered me, very curtly, that no such person was
in the house. I asked a porter, who sat near the entrance, describing
Lynch. He had seen the gentleman, but did not know where he was; he had
not taken a room or registered his name, and had probably gone away
again. It seemed to me that everything was going against me. I had to
go home to dinner, as I could spend no more time in looking for him
then; but I determined to renew the search in the evening.

As I walked down Fourth Street, I overtook Farringford, who had
evidently spent a portion of the dollar borrowed of Lynch for liquor.
I accosted him, for I thought that I might recover my money through his
agency, as he evidently knew Lynch.

"Ah, my lad! You didn't find him," chuckled the toper.

"I did not. I have heard of you, Mr. Farringford, and I can put you in
the way of making some money."

"Can you? Then I'm your man. Most distinctly, I'm your man," he
replied with emphasis. "There's only two things in this world that I
want, and those are money and whiskey. If I get the whiskey, I don't
care for the money; and if I have the money, I can always get the
whiskey."

"I should like to meet you somewhere this evening, for I am in a hurry
now."

"I will be in the bar-room of the Planters' Hotel at seven o'clock this
evening, if you have any money for me. But what's it all about? Can't
you tell me now?"

"I haven't time now."

"Very well. Planters' Hotel--bar-room--seven o'clock. I'll be there if
they don't turn me out before that time. If they do, you will find me
in the street."

Although I was not very confident he would keep his appointment, it
was the best I could do. If he failed to be there, he was evidently
a character so noted, that I could easily find him. I hastened to my
dinner, and reached Mrs. Greenough's rather late. I explained the
reason of my tardiness, which was quite satisfactory. My landlady
hoped that I should recover my money, and I hoped so too--a degree of
unanimity which does not always exist between landlady and boarder.

I was on the work as the clock struck one, but I had to do some running
that noon, in order to protect my reputation. Conant did not drive
business in the afternoon as he had in the forenoon, when I think he
intended to wear me out. We worked steadily, and I kept my end of the
board up. I was not sorry to hear the clock strike six, for I was
tired, though perhaps not more so than Conant himself. I went home, ate
my supper, did my chores in the house, and at seven o'clock I was in
the bar-room of the Planters' Hotel. It was no place for a boy, or a
man either, for that matter. No one was what could be called, in good
society, disreputably drunk, unless it was the seedy gentleman whom I
met by appointment; and even he was able to handle himself tolerably
well. No doubt he would have been more intoxicated if he had not drank
up the dollar he had borrowed; but his wits were not wholly stupefied.

"Well, my lad, you have come, and so have I," said Farringford, when I
entered the room. "Both come, and that makes two of us, all told."

"Yes. I wanted to see you about--"

"Stop a minute, my lad," interposed he, putting his trembling hand upon
my shoulder. "Let us go to work right. When I used to run steamboats,
we had to put in wood and water before we could get up steam."

"When did you run steamboats?" I asked.

"Ten or fifteen years ago. I was a rich man then; but now I'm as poor
as a church mouse with his hair all singed off. I am; but I'm jolly;
yes, I am jolly. Let's proceed to business."

"Did you own a steamboat--"

"Stop, my lad; I owned half a dozen of them. But that's no matter now.
Do you happen to have a dollar in your pocket--one dollar, my lad."

"No, sir; I have not."

"Not a dollar?"

"No, I have not."

"Do you happen to have half a dollar in your pocket, my lad?"

"Not even half a dollar, sir."

"Your name is--somebody told me your name," said he, musing.

"Phil, sir."

"Phil, do you always speak the truth?"

"I always endeavor to do so," I replied.

"I hope so. Truth is mighty, and must prevail. You should always speak
the truth."

"As you did, to-day, when you said you had known me from my babyhood."

"Boys must speak the truth, whether men do or not. Did you speak the
truth when you said you had not even half a dollar?"

"I did."

"Have you any money?"

"I have thirty cents."

"Then lend me a quarter."

"It's all I have."

"We can't do any business till this little matter is attended to," said
he, with tipsy solemnity. "You shall be paid, my lad; you shall be
paid--when I pay the rest of my creditors."

Finding it impossible to proceed any farther without complying with his
request, I reluctantly gave him the quarter; but I felt guilty in doing
so. He went to the bar, drank, and returned to the corner where he had
left me.




  CHAPTER X.

  IN WHICH PHIL LISTENS TO A VERY IMPRESSIVE TEMPERANCE LECTURE.


Farringford was very chipper when he returned to me. He had drank
half a tumbler of whiskey, and appeared to be prepared, to his own
satisfaction, for any business which might be presented to him.

"Now, my lad, I'm ready. I'm refreshed. I'm invigorated. I'm inspired.
In a word, I'm prepared for the consideration of the important matter
you proposed to bring before me," said he.

"I am very glad to hear it, sir; I wish to tell you--"

"Stop a moment, my lad. You have a name, doubtless. Do you happen to
remember what it is?"

"Very distinctly, Mr. Farringford. You may call me Phil."

  [Illustration: PHIL MEETS A SEEDY INDIVIDUAL NAMED FARRINGFORD.
  Page 109.]

"Phil; that is very good as far as it goes. Phil may stand for Philip,
Phillimore, Philippians, Philosophy."

"It stands for Philip with me, sir."

"Philip; I had a brother once of that name, but he is no longer living.
If he were, he would blush to own his brother. But no matter; that is
all past and gone. You can proceed with your business, Philip."

Placing his elbows upon the little table between us, he rested his chin
upon his trembling hands, and fixed his gaze upon me. He was a singular
man, and, tipsy as he was, I was deeply interested in him.

"You know Lynch, the person you met opposite the Planters' Hotel to-day
noon."

"I know him, Philip; but, in a word, I don't know any good of him. Go
on."

"That man robbed me of all the money I had, except thirty cents--nearly
a hundred dollars."

"Philip, you told me you were in the habit of speaking the truth; or
rather that you endeavored to speak the truth."

"Yes, sir; I do endeavor to speak the truth. I am willing to go a
point farther, and say that I have thus far been very successful."

"The statement that Lynch robbed you of nearly a hundred dollars
implies the statement that you had nearly a hundred dollars," said he,
with his tipsy solemnity, which was amusing. "It is self-evident that
he could not have robbed you of this money, if you had not had it."

"Certainly not sir. I did have it."

"Where and by what means should a boy of your tender years obtain
nearly a hundred dollars? In a word, Philip, where did you get your
money?"

"It was a part of what was left me by my foster-father, who died last
spring. I had it with me to pay my expenses till I could get into
business and pay my way. I expect my friends will be in St. Louis in a
few days, and then I shall be able to prove all I say. In the mean time
I refer to Captain Davis, of the steamer Fawn."

"That's all straightforward, Philip, and for the present I accept your
statement as true. You were robbed of nearly a hundred dollars by this
man, Lynch, of whom I know no good thing, except that he lent me a
dollar to-day, which I shall return to him when I pay the rest of my
creditors."

"Could you find this man, Mr. Farringford?" I asked.

"Doubtless I could. He may be seen, almost any night, at the
gambling-houses."

"Will you help me get my money back?"

"Wherefore should I soil the dignity of a gentleman by becoming a
thief-taker?"

"Because you will do me a favor, and promote the ends of justice by
doing so."

"Very true, Philip; you rightly apprehend the character of the
gentleman you address. Whatever I may seem to be, no man can say
that Edward Farringford ever soiled his soul by a dishonorable or a
dishonest act."

"If you can induce Lynch to give me back my money, I will pay you
twenty-five dollars."

"Twenty-five dollars!" exclaimed he. "Two hundred and fifty drinks!
Philip, I will do the best I can for you; not for the sake of the
money, but to subserve the ends of justice, and to save a deserving
young man from want and hardship. The cause is a good one."

"It is, sir. If you do not succeed, I shall call upon the police as
soon as my friends arrive."

"It is well, Philip. Lynch will return the money rather than be driven
from St. Louis."

"You understand that he must pay the money to me," I added, as it
occurred to me that I should never see it if it came into the hands of
the dilapidated gentleman before me.

"Wouldn't it be just as well that he should pay it over to me, and I
will pass it to you?"

"Just as well, sir; but he will want some assurance from me that this
is the end of the matter. I prefer that he should pay it to me."

"You are right, Philip. It shall be paid to you. Stop!" exclaimed he,
with a sudden start.

"What is the matter, Mr. Farringford?"

"This business is wrong."

"Wrong?"

"Wrong! No living man has been, or shall ever be, able to say that
Edward Farringford stained his soul with a foul, dishonorable act."

"Do you think it would be wrong, sir?"

"It would be compounding a felony," he added, solemnly.

I did not know what he meant by this technical phrase, but I could
not see that it was wrong for me to get my money if I could. Mr.
Farringford asked me when, where, and in what manner I had been robbed;
and I related my adventure on the night I was at Leavenworth.

"You are the only witness, Philip, and it would be difficult to prove
the crime. I will see Lynch. I will charge him with the base deed, and
be governed, in my further proceedings, by the circumstances of the
case. Where do you live, Philip?"

I gave him the address of Mrs. Greenough, and told him where I was
at work. I was satisfied that the promised reward would stimulate
him to great activity in the pursuit of Lynch, and I had some hope
that he would be successful. Having disposed of the important part
of my business with my seedy companion, I was rather curious to know
more about him. I almost dared to believe that he could give me some
information in regard to the steamer which had been burned on the upper
Missouri, and from which I had been saved by my foster-father.

That steamer had borne the name of this man, and he had been her owner.
Of course he knew all about her, and it was possible, even probable,
that he knew who had lost a little child in the fearful calamity. I
actually trembled when I thought of it, when I considered that, at
the opening of this singular man's lips, I might be told who and what
my father was, and whether my parents had perished or not. It was an
anxious moment, and my heart was in my throat. I had not the courage to
ask the momentous question, and Farringford rose unsteadily from his
chair, to leave me.

"Stop a moment, Mr. Farringford, if you please," I interposed; and he
dropped back into his chair.

"Isn't our business finished, Philip?"

"Yes, sir; but I have been told that you were formerly a large
steamboat owner."

"Who told you so?"

"You did, for one. If you don't object, I should like to ask you
something about those steamers," I continued, with much embarrassment.

"Do you wish to go into the steamboat business, Philip? If you do,
some of my old captains are still on the river, and I can get you a
situation. But I must have one more drink before I say anything."

"I wouldn't take any more, sir," I ventured to say.

"It is a necessity of my being, Philip."

He rose from his chair, and went to the bar. I saw him drink another
half tumbler of whiskey. He tottered back to the table where I sat.
Such a wreck of a man I had never seen. Though his step was unsteady,
he was not overcome by the potions he had taken. His nerves, rather
than his brain, seemed to be affected.

"I haven't drank much to-day, Philip. I wasted half the dollar I
borrowed in getting something to eat," said he, dropping into his
chair. "It is a bad habit, my boy. Never take any whiskey, Philip: in
a word, never begin to drink liquor, and you will never have to leave
off; for it is a great deal harder to leave off than it is to begin.
This is disinterested advice: in a word, it is the counsel of one who
knows all about drinking."

"I would stop it if I were you, Mr. Farringford."

"If you were Edward Farringford, you could no more leave off drinking
liquor, and drinking all you could get, than you could leave off
eating. I can live without eating much, but I can't live without
drinking."

"I think you can leave off, sir; I hope you will try."

"You speak like a boy. You never drank any whiskey. You don't know what
a fiend it is. You don't know what a horrible necessity it is to a
man whose nerves are shaken, only to be steadied by this liquid fire;
whose stomach, chilled and frozen, can only be warmed by this blast
from Tartarus. You don't know anything about it. I hope you never will.
Philip, I hope you never will."

He covered his face with his hands, and when he raised his head, I saw
that he had been weeping. His eyes were filled with tears, and I pitied
him from the deepest depths of my heart.

"Beware, Philip! Beware!" said he, solemnly. "Never touch a drop of
whiskey, wine, or even ale,--not the tenth part of a drop,--if you are
dying for the want of it. Die, but don't touch it."

"I hope I never shall."

"Hope! Don't hope! Sign the pledge; swear on the Holy Bible; go down
on your knees, every morning and every night, and pray that Almighty
God will help you, and save you from the curse. Don't trifle with it,
Philip. Be in earnest, and when you feel weak, commend yourself to God,
and think of Edward Farringford."

He covered his face with his hands again, and wept so bitterly, that
the little table danced under the convulsive agony which shook his
frame.

"Look at me, Philip!" said he, raising his head again. "Behold the
wreck of a man! If there had been no whiskey in the world, or if I had
never tasted it, I could have welcomed you to the most elegant mansion
in St. Louis. I could have pointed you to a dozen steamers, on the
Missouri and Mississippi, which were all mine. I could have presented
you to my wife, the most beautiful and accomplished woman in the city,
now driven out from my presence. More than this, Philip, I could have
pointed you to my boy, my son, my only child, who perished in the cold
waters of the Missouri, because I was too drunk to save him!"

I need not say how startled, how thrilled I was by this agonizing
narrative. The bar-room was crowded, and noisy with the violent debates
of excited politicians, and the gabble of men warmed by their cups
into unusual hilarity, so that no one appeared to notice Farringford,
though he uttered his impressive warnings in a loud tone. But I was too
much moved and thrilled myself to heed what others said or did. The
toper wept, and then tried to shake off the remembrance of the past.

"Where was your son lost, Mr. Farringford?" I asked, choking with
emotion.

"On the upper Missouri. He was a child under three. His name was
Philip, like yours. He was named after my brother, who died ten years
ago. Enough of this. I am almost crazy When I think of it."

The broken-down toper was my father!




  CHAPTER XI.

  IN WHICH PHIL TAKES HIS FATHER TO HIS NEW HOME.


My father! I had found him; but the finding of him in such a miserable,
degraded, besotted being as he who was before me seemed to be the
greatest mishap, the most overwhelming misfortune, that could possibly
have overtaken me. He was the first white man I had ever seen really
intoxicated. I was mortified and disheartened as I looked at his pale,
thin face, and regarded his trembling limbs.

What should I do? I could not tell him that I was his son. I could not
throw myself into his arms and weep tears of joy, as I had imagined the
impressive scene, in case I should ever find either of my parents. I
wanted to weep; I wanted to give myself up to a transport of grief, if
not despair, as I realized the terrible truth that the degraded being
before me was my father.

"Philip, I've told you more than I ever uttered before. You looked into
my face, and seemed so interested that I was tempted to tell more than
I intended," said he, wiping away with his coat sleeve the tears that
stained his sunken cheeks. "No matter; we will be jolly now. I can
get another drink in a cheap grog-shop for the half dime I have in my
pocket."

To my surprise he laughed as easily as he had wept, and shook off, with
astonishing facility, the burden which had weighed him down. He rose
from his chair, and tottered towards the door. I followed him out into
the street.

"Where are you going now?" I asked.

"Going to get a cheap drink," he replied, with a kind of chuckle. "I
shall be all right then; and we'll go and look for Lynch."

"Don't drink any more to-night, Mr. Farringford," I pleaded, taking his
arm.

"I must!" said he, vehemently. "I might as well tell you not to eat
after you had been without food for a week, as you tell me not to
drink. I must have whiskey, or die."

"Then die!" I added, using his own words.

"Die?"

"That's what you said to me."

"I might do that, Philip," he replied, stopping suddenly in the street,
as if the idea impressed him favorably.

"Of course I did not mean that, sir," I interposed.

"But it would be better to die than live as I live. I have only one
cheap drink left--one glass of camphene whiskey, which seems to burn my
very soul. In a word, it is better to die than to live, for such as I
am."

"No; there is hope for you," I pleaded, leading him along through the
street.

"Hope? No more than for a man who is already dead, Philip. I shall
take my cheap drink, and then I shall be penniless again. It may be
twenty-four hours, perhaps forty-eight, before I can raise another
dollar or another drink. Then I shall suffer with horrors I cannot
describe, till I can get more whiskey."

"Where do you live?"

"Nowhere."

"Where do you board?"

"I don't board," he replied, with his usual chuckle.

"Where do you sleep?"

"Wherever I happen to drop. In the police station; on board a
steamboat; in a shed; anywhere or nowhere."

"But where were you going to-night?" I asked, shocked at this
revelation of misery, so horrible and strange to me.

"I was going to the gambling-houses to find Lynch."

"But after that?"

"Anywhere that my fancy leads me."

"Come with me," said I, unwilling to abandon him.

"Where?"

"To my house--where I board."

"No, Philip."

"You shall sleep with me to-night."

I knew that Mrs. Greenough would not wish such a lodger as he, but I
was determined to do what I could for him; and, if she would not permit
him to sleep with me, I would go out with my miserable parent. I
wanted to see him when he was sober. He had told me that his wife had
deserted him, and I wished to learn more about her. I could not allude
to a theme so sacred while he was in his present condition. Hopeless as
the task seemed to be, I intended to use all the powers which God had
given me in reforming him.

I led him in the direction of my boarding-house, and he seemed to be as
willing to go one way as another. After he had delivered himself of the
emotions which crowded upon him at the bar-room, he spoke lightly of
his misfortunes, and chuckled whenever he alluded to any circumstance
which was particularly degrading in his condition.

"Where do you obtain your meals, Mr. Farringford?" I asked, as much to
keep his attention occupied as to gratify my own curiosity.

"I don't obtain many," he replied, lightly.

"But you must eat."

"Not when I can drink. I don't average more than one meal a day. I
can't afford to waste my money, when I have any, in eating."

"Do you live on one meal a day?"

"I don't get that always."

"Where do you get that one?"

"Anywhere I can. They have meals on board the steamers lying at the
levee and waiting to start. They never turn me off when I sit down to
the table. If I'm very drunk, they give me my meal at a side-table; but
that don't happen often, for I don't want to eat when I can get plenty
to drink."

How insufferably miserable and degrading was the life he led! And he
was my father!

"How long have you led such a life?" I inquired, with a shudder.

"Not long, Philip. Do you know, my lad, that I'm telling you all this
to save you from whiskey? I'm not drunk now. I know what I'm about; and
I would go ten miles to-night to save any fellow-creature, even if it
was a nigger, from being as bad as I am. I would, Philip; upon my honor
and conscience I would."

"That proves that you have a kind heart," I replied; and even as he
revelled in his shame and misery, I was glad often to observe these
touches of fine feeling, for they assured me that, in his better
days, he had been a noble and generous man.

  LANDLADY. Page 130.]

"My heart is right, my boy. Like all drunkards--Yes, Philip, I'm a
drunkard. I know it; and I call things by their right names. Like all
drunkards, I've been growing worse and worse; but it's only a few
months since I went into the street, and had no home, no place to lay
my head at night."

I led him to Mrs. Greenough's house. He said nothing more about the
"cheap drink," for I had kept his mind busy on the way. I had a night
key, and I admitted him to the entry, where I asked him to wait until
I spoke with my landlady. In as few words as possible I informed her
of the discovery I had made, and distinctly added that my father was
intoxicated.

"Will you allow me to take care of him in my room, Mrs. Greenough?" I
asked.
