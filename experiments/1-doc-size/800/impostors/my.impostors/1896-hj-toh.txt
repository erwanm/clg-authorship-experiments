portentous kind." 

Rose was silent a little. " You didn't give it ? " 

"I turned it off I refused to take any such 
discussion seriously. I said : ' My own darling, 
how can I meet you on so hateful a basis ? Wait 
till you are dying ! ' ' He lost himself an instant ; 
then he was again on his feet. "How in the 



 

world can she dream I'm capable ?" He 

hadn't patience even to finish his phrase. 

Rose, however, finished it. " Of taking a sec 
ond wife ? Ah, that's another affair ! " she sadly 
exclaimed. " We've nothing to do with that," she 
added. " Of course you understand Julia's feel- 
ing." 

" Her feeling ? " Tony once more stood in front 
of her. 

" Why, what's at the bottom of her dread of 
your marrying again ? " 

" Assuredly I do ! Mrs. Grantham naturally 
shes at the bottom. She has filled Julia with the 
vision of my perhaps giving our child a step 
mother." 

" Precisely," Rose said, " and if you had known, 
as I knew it, Julia's girlhood, you would do jus 
tice to the force of that horror. It possesses her 
whole being she would prefer that the child 
should die." 

Tony Bream, musing, shook his head with 
sombre decision. " Well, I would prefer that 
they neither of them should ! " 

" The simplest thing, then, is to give her your 
word." 

" My ' word ' isn't enough," Tony said ; " she 





wants mystic rites and spells ! The simplest 
thing, moreover, was exactly what I desired to do. 
My objection to the performance she demands 
was that that was just what it seemed to me not 
to be." 

"Try it," said Rose, smiling. 

"To bring her round?" 

" Before the Doctor returns. When he comes, 
you know, he won't let you go back to her." 

" Then I'll go now," said Tony, already at the 
door. 

Rose had risen from the sofa. "Be very brief 
but be very strong." 

" I'll swear by all the gods that or any other 
nonsense." Rose stood there opposite to him with 
a fine, rich urgency which operated as a detention. 
" I see you're right," he declared. " You always 
are, and I'm always indebted to you." Then as 
he opened the door : " Is there anything else ? " 

"Anything else?" 

"I mean that you advise." 

She thought a moment. " Nothing but that 
for you to seem to enter thoroughly into her idea, 
to show her you understand it as she understands 
it herself." 

Tony looked vague. " As she does ? " 



 

" Why, for the lifetime of your daughter." 
As he appeared still not fully to apprehend, she 
risked: "If you should lose Effie the reason 
would fail." 

Tony, at this, jerked back his head with a flush. 
" My dear Rose, you don't imagine that it's as a 
needed vow " 

" That you would give it?" she broke in. "Cer 
tainly I don't, any more than I suppose the de 
gree of your fidelity to be the ground on which 
we're talking. But the thing is to convince Julia, 
and I said that only because she'll be more con 
vinced if you strike her as really looking at what 
you subscribe to." 

Tony gave his nervous laugh. " Don't you 
know I always ' put down my name ' - especially 
to ' appeals ' in the most reckless way ? " Then 
abruptly, in a different tone, as if with a passion 
ate need to make it plain, " I shall never, never, 
never," he protested, "so much as look at another 
woman ! " 

The girl approved with an eager gesture. 
"You've got it, my dear Tony. Say it to her 
that way ! " But he had already gone, and, turn 
ing, she found herself face to face with her lover, 
who had come back as she spoke. 



VIII 

WITH his letter in his hand Dennis Vidal stood 
and smiled at her. "What in the world has 
your dear Tony ' got,' and what is he to say ? " 

" To say ? Something to his wife, who appears 
to have fallen into an extraordinary state." 

The young man's face fell. " What sort of a 
state?" 

" A strange discouragement about herself. 
She's morbid and frightened she thinks she's 
sinking." 

Dennis looked grave. "Poor little lady 
what a bore for us ! I remember her per 
fectly." 

" She of course remembers you," Rose said. 
" She takes the friendliest interest in your being 
here." 

"That's most kind of her in her condition." 

" Oh, her condition," Rose returned, " isn't 
quite so bad as she thinks ! " 





 

"I see." Dennis hesitated. "And that's 
what Mr. Bream's to tell her." 

"That's a part of it." Rose glanced at the 
document he had brought to her ; it was in its 
envelope, and he tapped it a little impatiently 
on his left finger-tips. What she said, however, 
had no reference to it. " She's haunted with a 
nervous alarm on the subject, of all things, 
of his marrying again." 

" If she should die ? She wants him not to ? " 
Dennis asked. 

"She wants him not to." Rose paused a 
moment. " She wants to have been the only one." 

He reflected, slightly embarrassed with this 
peep into a situation that but remotely concerned 
him. " Well, I suppose that's the way women 
often feel." 

"I daresay it is." The girl's gravity gave the 
gleam of a smile. " I daresay it's the way I 
should." 

Dennis Vidal, at this, simply seized her and 
kissed her. "You needn't be afraid you'll be 
the only one ! " 

His embrace had been the work of a few sec 
onds, and she had made no movement to escape 
from it ; but she looked at him as if to convey 





that the extreme high spirits it betrayed were 
perhaps just a trifle mistimed. " That's what I 
recommended him," she dropped, "to say to 
Julia." 

"Why, I should hope so ! " Presently, as if a 
little struck, Dennis continued : "Doesn't he want 
to?" 

"Absolutely. They're all in all to each other. 
But he's naturally much upset and bewildered." 

" And he came to you for advice ? " 

" Oh, he comes to me," Rose said, " as he 
might come to talk of her with the mother that, 
poor darling, it's her misfortune never to have 
known." 

The young man's vivacity again played up. 
" He treats you, you mean, as his mother-in- 
law?" 

" Very much. But I'm thoroughly nice to 
him. People can do anything with me who are 
nice to her." 

Dennis was silent a moment ; he had slipped 
his letter out of its cover. " Well, I hope they're 
grateful to you for such devotion." 

" Grateful to me, Dennis ? They quite adore 
me." Then as if to remind him of something it 
was important he should feel : " Don't you see 



 

what it is for a poor girl to have such an anchor 
age as this such honourable countenance, such 
a place to fall back upon ? " 

Thus challenged, her visitor, with a moment's 
thought, did frank justice to her question. " I'm 
certainly glad you've such jolly friends one 
sees they're charming people. It has been a 
great comfort to me lately to know you were 
with them." He looked round him, conscien 
tiously, at the bright and beautiful hall. " It 
is a good berth, my dear, and it must be a pleas 
ure to live with such fine things. They've given 
me a room up there that's full of them an 
awfully nice room." He glanced at a picture 
or two he took in the scene. " Do they roll 
in wealth?" 

" They're like all bankers, I imagine," said 
Rose. "Don't bankers always roll ? " 

"Yes, they seem literally to wallow. What a 
pity we ain't bankers, eh ? " 

" Ah, with my friends here their money's the 
least part of them," the girl answered. " The 
great thing's their personal goodness." 

Dennis had stopped before a large photograph, 
a great picture in a massive frame, supported, on 
a table, by a small gilded easel. " To say noth- 





ing of their personal beauty ! He's tremendously 
good-looking." 

Rose glanced with an indulgent sigh at a 
representation of Tony Bream in all his splendour, 
in a fine white waistcoat and a high white hat, 
with a stick and gloves and a cigar, his orchid, his 
stature, and his smile. " Ah, poor Julia's taste ! " 

"Yes," Dennis exclaimed, "one can see how 
he must have fetched her ! " 

" I mean the style of the thing," said Rose. 

"It isn't good, eh? Well, you know." Then 
turning away from the picture the young man 
added: "They'll be after him!" 

Rose faltered. " The people she fears ? " 

" The dear ladies, bless 'em if he should lose 
her." 

"I daresay," said Rose. "But he'll be proof." 

" Has he told you so ? " Dennis smiled. 

She met his smile with a kind of conscious 
bravado in her own. " In so many words. But 
he assures me he'll calm her down." 

Dennis was silent a little : he had now unfolded 
his letter and run his eyes over it. "What a 
funny subject for him to be talking about ! " 

" With me, do you mean ? " 

"Yes, and with his wife." 



 

"My dear man," Rose exclaimed, "you can 
imagine he didn't begin it ! " 

" Did you ? " her companion asked. 

She hesitated again, and then, " Yes idiot ! " 
she replied with a quiet humour that produced, 
on his part, another demonstration of tenderness. 
This attempt she arrested, raising her hand, as she 
appeared to have heard a sound, with a quick 
injunction to listen. 

" What's the matter ? " 

She bent her ear. " Wasn't there a cry from 
Julia's room ? " 

" I heard nothing." 

Rose was relieved. " Then it's only my ner 
vousness." 

Dennis Vidal held up his letter. " Is your 
nervousness too great to prevent your giving a 
moment's attention to this ? " 

" Ah, your letter ? " Rose's eyes rested on it 
as if she had become conscious of it for the first 
time. 

"It very intimately concerns our future," said 
her visitor. " I went up for it so that you should 
do me the favour to read it." 

She held out her hand promptly and frankly. 
"Then give it to me let me keep it a little." 





" Certainly ; but kindly remember that I've 
still to answer it I mean referring to points. 
I've waited to see you because it's from the ' gov 
ernor ' himself practically saying what he'll do 
for me." 

Rose held the letter ; her large light eyes 
widened with her wonder and her sympathy. 
" Is it something very good ? " 

Dennis prescribed, with an emphatic but amused 
nod at the paper, a direction to her curiosity. 
" Read and you'll see ! " 

She dropped her eyes, but after a moment, 
while her left hand patted her heart, she raised 
them with an odd, strained expression. " I mean 
is it really good enough ? " 

" That's exactly what I want you to tell me ! " 
Dennis laughed out. A certain surprise at her 
manner was in his face. 

While she noted it she heard a sound again, a 
sound this time explained by the opening of the 
door of the vestibule. Doctor Ramage had come 
back ; Rose put down her letter. " I'll tell you 
as soon as I have spoken to the Doctor." 



IX 



THE Doctor, eagerly, spoke to her first. " Our 
friend has not come back ? " 

" Mine has," said Rose with grace. " Let me 
introduce Mr. Vidal." Doctor Ramage beamed a 
greeting, and our young lady, with her discreet 
gaiety, went on to Dennis : " He too thinks all 
the world of me." 

" Oh, she's a wonder she knows what to 
do ! But you'll see that for yourself," said the 
Doctor. 

" I'm afraid you won't approve of we," Dennis 
replied with solicitude. " You'll think me rather 
in your patient's way." 

"Doctor Ramage laughed. "No indeed I'm 
sure Miss Armiger will keep you out of it." 
Then looking at his watch, " Bream's not with 
her still?" he inquired of Rose. 

"He came away, but he returned to her." 

"He shouldn't have done that." 






" It was by my advice, and I'm sure you'll find 
it's all right," Rose replied. "But you'll send 
him back to us." 

" On the spot." And the Doctor danced off. 

"He's not at all easy," Dennis pronounced 
when he had gone. 

Rose demurred. "How do you know that?" 

"By looking at him. I'm not such a fool," 
her visitor added with some emphasis, "as you 
strike me as wishing to make of me." 

Rose candidly stared. " As I strike you as 

wishing ? " For a moment this young couple 

looked at each other hard, and they both changed 
colour. " My dear Dennis, what do you mean ? " 

He evidently felt that he had been almost vio 
lently abrupt; but it would have been equally 
evident to a spectator that he was a man of cool 
courage. "I mean, Rose, that I don't quite 
know what's the matter with you. It's as if, 
unexpectedly, on my eager arrival, I find some 
thing or other between us." 

She appeared immensely relieved. "Why, my 
dear child, of course you do ! Poor Julia's be 
tween us much between us." She faltered 
again ; then she broke out with emotion : " I may 
as well confess it frankly I'm miserably anxious. 



 

Good heavens," she added with impatience, " don't 
you see it for yourself ? " 

" I certainly see that you're agitated and absent 
as you warned me so promptly you would be. 
But remember you've quite denied to me the 
gravity of Mrs. Bream's condition." 

Rose's impatience overflowed into a gesture. 
"I've been doing that to deceive my own self!" 

"I understand," said Dennis kindly. "Still," 
he went on, considering, " it's either one thing or 
the other. The poor lady's either dying, you 
know, or she ain't ! " 

His friend looked at him with a reproach too 
fine to be uttered. " My dear Dennis you're 
harsh ! " 

He showed a face as conscientious as it was 
blank. " I'm crude possibly coarse ? Perhaps 
I am without intention." 

"Think what these people are to me," said 
Rose. 

He was silent a little. " Is it anything so very 
extraordinary? Oh, I know," he went on, as if 
he feared she might again accuse him of a want 
of feeling ; " I appreciate them perfectly I do 
them full justice. Enjoying their hospitality 
here, I'm conscious of all their merits." The 


letter she had put down was still on the table, 
and he took it up and fingered it a moment. 
"All I mean is that I don't want you quite 
to sink the fact that Fin something to you 
too." 

She met this appeal with instant indulgence. 
" Be a little patient with me," she gently said. 
Before he could make a rejoinder, she pursued: 
"You yourself are impressed with the Doctor's 
being anxious. I've been trying not to think 
so, but I daresay you're right. There, I've an 
other worry." 

" The greater your worry, then, the more press 
ing our business." Dennis spoke with cordial 
decision, while Rose, moving away from him, 
reached the door by which the Doctor had gone 
out. She stood there as if listening, and he con 
tinued: "It's me, you know, that you've now to 
' fall back ' upon." 

She had already raised a hand with her clear 
" Hush ! " arid she kept her eyes on her com 
panion while she tried to catch a sound. "The 
Doctor said he would send him out of the room. 
But he doesn't." 

" All the better for your reading this." Den 
nis held out the letter to her. 



 

She quitted her place. "If he's allowed to 
stay, there must be something wrong." 

" I'm very sorry for them ; but don't you call 
that a statement ? " 

" Ah, your letter ? " Her attention came back 
to it, and, taking it from him, she dropped again 
upon the sofa with it. " Voyons, voyons this great 
affair!" she had the air of trying to talk her 
self into calmness. 

Dennis stood a moment before her. " It puts 
us on a footing that really seems to me sound." 

She had turned over the leaf to take the measure 
of the document; there were three large, close, 
neat pages. " He's a trifle long-winded, the 
'governor' ! " 

" The longer the better," Dennis laughed, " when 
it's all in that key ! Read it, my dear, quietly and 
carefully; take it in it's really simple enough." 
He spoke soothingly and tenderly, turning off to 
give her time and not oppress her. He moved 
slowly about the hall, whistling very faintly and 
looking again at the pictures, and when he had 
left her she followed him a minute with her eyes. 
Then she transferred them to the door at which 
she had just listened ; instead of reading she 
watched as if for a movement of it. If there had 





been anyone at that moment to see her face, such 
an observer would have found it strangely, tragi 
cally convulsed : she had the appearance of holding 
in with extraordinary force some passionate sob or 
cry, some smothered impulse of anguish. This 
appearance vanished miraculously as Dennis turned 
at the end of the room, and what he saw, while 
the great showy clock ticked in the scented still 
ness, was only his friend's study of what he had put 
before her. She studied it long, she studied it in 
silence a silence so unbroken by inquiry or com 
ment that, though he clearly wished not to seem 
to hurry her, he drew nearer again at last and 
stood as if waiting for some sign. 

" Don't you call that really meeting a fellow ? " 
"I must read it again," Rose replied without 
looking up. She turned afresh to the beginning, 
and he strolled away once more. She went 
through to the end; after which she said with 
tranquillity, folding the letter : " Yes ; it shows 
what they think of you." She put it down where 
she had put it before, getting up as he came back 
to her. " It's good not only for what he says, but 
for the way he says it." 

" It's a jolly bit more than I expected." Dennis 
picked the letter up and, restoring it to its en- 



 

velope, slipped it almost lovingly into a breast 
pocket. " It does show, I think, that they don't 
want to lose me." 

" They're not such fools ! " Rose had in her 
turn moved off, but now she faced him, so intensely 
pale that he was visibly startled ; all the more that 
it marked still more her white grimace. " My dear 
boy, it's a splendid future." 

" I'm glad it strikes you so ! " he laughed. 

" It's a great joy you're all right. As I said 
a while ago, you're a made man." 

"Then by the same token, of course, you're 
a made woman ! " 

" I'm very, very happy about you," she brightly 
conceded. " The great thing is that there's more 
to come." 

" Rather there's more to come ! " said Dennis. 
He stood meeting her singular smile. " I'm only 
waiting for it." 

"I mean there's a lot behind a general 
attitude. Read between the lines ! " 

"Don't you suppose I have, Miss? I didn't 
venture, myself, to say that to you." 

" Do I have so to be prompted and coached ? " 
asked Rose. " I don't believe you even see all 
I mean. There are hints and tacit promises 





glimpses of what may happen if you'll give 
them time." 

" Oh, I'll give them time ! " Dennis declared. 
" But he's really awfully cautious. You're sharp 
to have made out so much." 

"Naturally I'm sharp." Then, after an in 
stant, "Let me have the letter again," the girl 
said, holding out her hand. Dennis promptly 
drew it forth, and she took it and went over 
it in silence once more. He turned away as he 
had done before, to give her a chance ; he 
hummed slowly, to himself, about the room, and 
once more, at the end of some minutes, it 
appeared to strike him that she prolonged her 
perusal. But when he approached her again 
she was ready with her clear contentment. She 
folded the letter and handed it back to him. 
" Oh, you'll do ! " she proclaimed. 

"You're really quite satisfied?" 

She hesitated a moment. "For the present 
perfectly." Her eyes were on the precious 
document as he fingered it, and something in 
his way of doing so made her break into incon 
gruous gaiety. He had opened it delicately and 
been caught again by a passage. "You handle 
it as if it were a thousand-pound note ! " 



 

He looked up at her quickly. "It's much 
more than that. Capitalise his figure." 

"'Capitalise' it?" 

" Find the invested sum." 

Rose thought a moment. " Oh, I'll do every 
thing for you but cipher ! But it's millions." 
Then as he returned the letter to his pocket she 
added : " You should have that thing mounted in 
double glass with a little handle like a hand- 
screen." 

" There's certainly nothing too good for the 
charter of our liberties for that's what it really 
is," Dennis said. " But you can face the music ? " 
he went on. 

" The music ? " Rose was momentarily blank. 

He looked at her hard again. " You have, my 
dear, the most extraordinary vacuities. The figure 
we're talking of the poor, dear little figure. 
The five-hundred-and-forty," he a trifle sharply 
explained. " That's about what it makes." 

"Why, it seems to me a lovely little figure," 
said the girl. " To the ' likes ' of me, how can 
that be anything but a duck of an income ? Then," 
she exclaimed, " think also of what's to come ! " 

"Yes but I'm not speaking of anything you 
may bring." 





Rose wavered, judicious, as if trying to be as 
attentive as he desired. "I see without that. 
But I wasn't speaking of that either," she added. 

"Oh, you may count it I only mean I don't 
touch it. And the going out you take that 
too ? " Dennis asked. 

Rose looked brave. "Why it's only for two 
years." 

He flushed suddenly, as with a flood of reassur 
ance, putting his arms round her as round the 
fulfilment of his dream. " Ah, my own old girl ! " 

She let him clasp her again, but when she disen 
gaged herself they were somehow nearer to the 
door that led away to Julia Bream. She stood 
there as she had stood before, while he still held 
one of her hands; then she brought forth some 
thing that betrayed an extraordinary disconnection 
from all that had just preceded. "I can't make 
it out why he doesn't send him back ! " 

Dennis Vidal dropped her hand ; both his own 
went into his pockets, and he gave a kick to the 
turned-up corner of a rug. " Mr. Bream the 
Doctor? Oh, they know what they're about!" 

" The Doctor doesn't at all want him to be there. 
Something has happened," Rose declared as she 
left the door. 



 

Her companion said nothing for a moment. 
" Do you mean the poor lady's gone ? " he at last 
demanded. 

" Gone ? " Rose echoed. 

"Do you mean Mrs. Bream is dead?" 

His question rang out so that Rose threw her 
self back in horror. " Dennis God forbid ! " 

" God forbid too, I say. But one doesn't know 
what you mean you're too difficult to follow. 
One thing, at any rate, you clearly have in your 
head that we must take it as possibly on the 
cards. That's enough to make it remarkably to 
the point to remind you of the great change that 
would take place in your situation if she should 
die." 

" What else in the world but that change am I 
thinking of ? " Rose asked. 

" You're not thinking of it perhaps so much in 
the connection I refer to. If Mrs. Bream goes, 
your 'anchorage,' as you call it, goes." 

"I see what you mean." She spoke with the 
softest assent ; the tears had sprung into her eyes 
and she looked away to hide them. 

" One may have the highest possible opinion of 
her husband and yet not quite see you staying 
on here in the same manner with him" 





Rose was silent, with a certain dignity. " Not 
quite," she presently said with the same gen 
tleness. 

" The way therefore to provide against every
