that held her, so earnest the pressure of the 
lips that seemed to devour every part of her 
face by turns. In the midst of this Norton 
came with the strawberries; and he too stood 
still and offered no interruption. But when 
a pause in Mrs. Laval's ecstasy gave him a 
chance, he said low, 



 

" Mrs. Beechey, mamma, and Miss Beecheys, 
are there." 

Mrs. Laval was quiet a moment, hiding 
her face in Matilda's neck ; then she put her 
gently down, rose up, and met some ladies 
who were coming round the corner of the 
verandah, with a tone and bearing so coo] 
and careless and light, that Matilda asked 
her ears if it was possible. The guests were 
carried off into the house ; Matilda and Nor 
ton were left alone. 

It was Matilda's turn then. She set down 
the plate of strawberries Norton had given 
her and hid her face in her hands. 

Norton bore this for a minute, and no 
more. Then one of his hands came upon 
one of Matilda's, and the other upon the 
other, very gently but decidedly suggesting 
that they should come down. 

" Pink ! " said he, " this may do for mamma and you, but it is very poor entertainment 
for me. Come ! leave that, and eat your 
strawberries, and let us go on the lawn. The 
sun will do now." 



 

Matilda felt that this was reasonable, and 
she put by her own gratification. Neverthe 
less her eyes and eyelashes were alt glittering 
when she lifted them up. 

" What has mamma done to you ? " said 
Norton wondering. " Here, Pink, do you 
like strawberries?" 

" If you please, Norton," said Matilda, 
" couldn't I have them another time ? I don't 
want them now." 

" Then they may wait till we have done 
playing," said Norton ; " and then I'll have 
some too. Now come." 

The great trees cast a flickering shadow on 
the grass before the house. Norton planted 
his hoops and distributed colours, and 
presently Matilda's sober thoughts were 
driven as many ways as the balls ; and they 
went very widely indeed. 

" You must take aim, Matilda ? " Norton 
cried. 

"At what?" 

" Why you must learn at what ; that's the 



 

game. You must fight. Just as I fight you. 
You ought to touch my ball now, if you can. 
I don't believe you can. You might try." 

Matilda tried, and hit it. The game went 
on prosperously. The sun got lower, and the 
sunbeams came more scattering, and the 
breeze just stirred over the lawn ; not enough 
to bend the little short blades of grass. Mrs. 
Laval's visiters went away, and she came out 
on the verandah to look at the children ; they 
were too much engaged to look at her. At 
last the hard fought battle came to an end. 
Norton brought out another plate of strawberries for himself along with Matilda's, and 
the two sat down on the bank under the 
locust trees to eat them. The sun was near 
going down beyond the mountains by this 
time, and his setting rays changed the purple 
mist into a bath of golden haze. 

" How nice and cold these are," said Matilda. 

" They have been in the ice. That makes 
things cold," observed Norton. 



 

" And being warm oneself makes them 
seem colder," said Matilda. 

" Why, are you warm, Pink ? " 

" Yes, indeed. I have had to fight you so 
hard, you know." 

" You did very well," said Norton in a 
satisfied tone. 

" Norton, how pretty it all is to-night." 

Norton eat strawberries. 

" Very different from Lilac lane," said 
Matilda looking at the china plate in her hand, 
on which the painting was very fine and 
delicate. 

" Rather different," said Norton. 

" Norton, I was thinking of what you said 
yesterday ; how odd it is that some people 
should be rich and others poor." 

" I am glad I am one of the first sort," said 
Norton, disposing of a very large strawberry. 

" But isn't it strange ? " 

" That is what I said, Pink." 

" It don't seem right," said Matilda thought 
fully 



" Yes, it does." 

" It doesn't to me." 

" How can you help it ? " 

" Why 7 cannot help it, Norton ; but if 
everybody that is rich chose, they could help 
it." 

"How?" 

" Don't you think they ought ? " 

" Well how, Pink ? If people were in 
dustrious and behaved right, they wouldn't 
be poor, you see." 

" O but, Norton, they would sometimes. 
There is Mrs. Eldridge, and there are the poor 
women at Mrs. Rogers' ; and a great many 
more like them." 

" Well if somebody hadn't behaved wrong," 
said Norton, " they wouldn't be so hard up." 

" O but that does not help them." 

Not much." 

" And they ought to be helped," said Matilda slowly, examining the painted flowers 
on the china in her hand, and remembering 
Mrs. Eldridge's cracked delf tea-cup. 



 

" That plate would buy up the whole concern where we were yesterday, wouldn't it? " 

Matilda looked up suddenly, at Norton's 
thus touching her thought ; but she did not 
like to pursue it. Norton however had no 
scruples. 

" Yes ; and these strawberries, I suppose, 
would feed her for a week the old woman, 
I mean. And one of our drawing room chairs 
would furnish her house, pretty near. Yes, I 
guess it would. And I really think one week 
of the coal we burned a few months ago 
would keep her, and Mrs. Rogers too, warm 
all winter. And I am certain one of mamma's dresses would clothe her for a year. 
Seems queer, don't it." 

" And she is cold and hungry and uncom 
fortable," said Matilda. The two looked at 
each other. 

" But then, you know, if mamma gave one 
of her dresses to clothe this old woman, sh'e 
would have to give another to clothe some 
other old woman ; and the end would be, she _ 



 

would have no dresses for herself. And if 
she tried to warm all the cold houses, she 
wouldn't have firing to cook her own dinner. 
You see it has to be so, Pink ; some rich and 
some poor. And suppose these strawberries 
had been changed into some poor somebody's 
dinner, I couldn't have had them to give to 
you. Do you see, Pink ? " 

" But O, Norton ! " Matilda began, and 
stopped. " These strawberries are very nice." 

" But you would rather turn them into 
mutton chops and give them away?" said 
Norton. " I dare say you would ! Wouldn't 
you ? " 

" Norton," said Matilda cautiously, " do 
you think anything I could have bought with 
that dollar would have given me so much 
pleasure as that tea-kettle yesterday?" 

" It was a good investment," said Norton. 
" But it is right to eat strawberries, Pink. 
Where are you going to stop ? " 

" I'll take Mrs. Eldridge some strawberries," 
said Matilda smiling, " when they get plenty." 






" Well, agreed," said Norton. " Let us 
take her some other things too. I've got 
money. Stop let me put these plates in 
the house and fetch a piece of paper ; then 
we'll see what we'll take her." 

Matilda sat while he was gone, looking at 
the golden mist on the mountains and dreaming. 

" Now," said Norton, throwing himself on 
the turf beside her, with his piece of paper, and 
thrusting his hand deep down in his pocket 
to get at his pencil, " now let us see what we 
will do." 

" Norton," said Matilda joyously, " this is 
better than croquet." 

Norton looked up with those bright eyes of 
his, but his reply was to proceed to business. 

" Now for it, Pink. What shall we do for 
the old lady ? What does she want  Pooh ! 
she wants everything ; but what to begin 
with ? " 

" Strawberries, you said." 

"Strawberries! Not at all. That's the 



 

last thing. I mean we'll fix her up, Pink. 
Now what does she want, to be comfortable. It is only one old woman ; but we 
shall feel better if she is comfortable. Or 
you will." 

" But what do you mean, Norton ? how 
much can we do ? " 

"Just as much as we've a mind to. I've 
got money, I tell you. Come ; begin. What 
goes down first ? " 

" Why Norton," said Matilda in an ecstasy, 
" it is like a fairy story." 

What ? " 

" This, that we are doing. It is like a fairy 
story exactly." 

" How is it like fairy stories ? " said Norton. 
"I don't know." 

" Did you never read fairy stories ? " 

" Never. What are they like ? " 

" Why some of them are just like this," 
said Matilda. " People are rich, and can do 
what they please; and they set out to get 
things together for a feast, or to prepare a 



 

palace for some princess ; and first one nice 
thing is got, and then another, and then something else ; until by and by you feel as if you 
had been at the feast, or seen the palace, or 
had done the shopping. I do." 

" This isn't for a princess," said Norton. 
, " No, nor a palace," said Matilda ; " but it 
seems just as good." 

" Go on, Pink ; let us quit princesses and 
get to the real business. What do you want 
to get, first thing ? " 

" First thing," said Matilda, " I think would 
be to get somebody to clean the house. 
There are only two little rooms. It wouldn't 
be much. Don't you think so, Norton ? " 

" As we cannot build a palace, and have it 
new, I should say the old one had better be 
cleaned." 

" Sabrina Rogers would do it, I dare say," 
Matilda went on ; " and maybe that would 
be something good for her." 

" Teach her to clean her own ? " said Norton. 



" Why no, Norton ; her own is clean. I 
meant, maybe she would be glad of the 
pay." 

" There's another princess, eh, that wants 
a palace ? " said Norton. " If we could, we 
would new build Lilac lane, wouldn't we ? 
But then, I should want to make over the 
people that live in it." 

" So should I ; and that is the hardest. 
But perhaps, don't you think the people 
would be different, if they had things different?" 

" I'm certain I should be different, if I
lived where they do," said Norton. " But go 
on, Pink ; let us try it on what's her name. 
We have only cleaned her house yet." 

" The first thing, then, is a bedstead, Norton." 

" A bedstead ! What does she sleep on ? " 

" On the floor; with rags and straw, and I 
think a miserable make-believe of a bed. No 
sheets, no blankets, nor anything. It is 
dreadful." 



 

" Rags and straw," said Norton. " Then 
a bedstead wants a bed on it, Pink ? and 
blankets or coverlets or something, and sheets, 
and all that." 

Matilda watched Norton's pencil as it 
noted the articles. 

" Then she wants some towels, and a basin 
of some sort to wash in." 

" Hm ! " said Norton. Herself, I hope ? " 

" Yes, I hope so. But she has nothing to 
make herself clean with." 

" Then a stand and basin and towels ; 
and a pitcher, Pink, I suppose, to hold 
water." 

" Yes, a pitcher or jug or something. We 
want to get the cheapest things we can. And 
soap." 

" Let's have plenty of that," said Norton, 
putting down soap. " Now then what 
next ? " 

" A little wooden table, Norton ? she has 
nothing but a chair to set her tea on." 

" A table. And a carpet ? " 



 

" O no, Norton ; that's not necessary. It 
is warm weather now. She does not want 
that. But she does want a pail for water. I 
have to take the tea-kettle to the pump." 

Norton at this laughed, and rolled over on 
the grass in his amusement. Having thus 
refreshed himself, he came back to business. 

" Has she got anything to go on her fire, 
except a tea-kettle ? " 

" Not much. A saucepan would be a very 
useful thing, and not cost much. I bought 
one the other day; so I know." 

" What's a saucepan ? " said Norton. " A 
pan to make sauce in ? " 

It was Matilda's turn to laugh. " Poor Mrs. 
Eldridge don't have many puddings, I guess
to make sauce for," she said. 

" Well Pink, now we come, don't we, to 
the eating line. We must stock her up." 

'' Put down a broom first, Norton." 

" A broom ! Here goes." 

" Yes, you can't think how much I have 
wanted a broom there. And a tea-pot. O 




yes, and a little milk pitcher, and sugar bowl. 
Can't we ? " 

" I should think we could," said Norton. 
Tea-cups ? 

" I guess not. She's got two ; and three 
plates. Now, Norton the eatables. What 
did you think of? " 

" I suppose there isn't anything in the 
house," said Norton. 

" Nothing at all except what we took 
there." 

u Then she wants everything." 

" But You see, Norton, she can't do any 
thing herself; she couldn't use some things. 
There would be no use." 

" No use in what ? " 

" Flour, for instance. She couldn't make 
bread." 

" I don't know anything about flour," said 
Norton. " But she can use bread when she 
sees it, I will take my affidavit." 

" O yes, bread, Norton. We will take her 
some bread ; and a little butter. And sugar. 




And tea. She has got some, but it won't 
last long." 

" And I said she should have a mutton 
chop." 

" I dare say she would like it." 

" I wonder if a bushel of potatoes wouldn't 
be the best thing of all." 

" Potatoes would be excellent," said Ma 
tilda delightedly. " I suppose she would be 
very glad of anything of that sort. Let's 
take her some cheese, Norton." 

" Cheese. And strawberries. And cake, 
Pink." 

" I am afraid we should be taking too much 
at once. We had better leave the cake to 
another time." 

" There's something we forgot," said Norton. " Mr. What's-his-name will not split up 
box covers for your fire every day ; we must 
send in a load of firing. Wood, I guess." 

" O how good!" said Matilda. " You see, 
Norton, she has had no wood to make a fire 
even to boil her kettle." 




" And no kettle to boil," added Norton. 

" So that she went without even tea. I 
don't know how she lived. Did you see how 
she enjoyed the tea yesterday ? " 

" Pink," said Norton, " do you expect to 
go there to make her fire every day?" 

" No, Norton, I cannot every day ; I can 
not always get away from home. But I was 
thinking I know some other girls that I 
guess would help ; and if there were several 
of us, you know, it would be very easy." 

" Well," said Norton, " we have fixed up 
this palace and princess now. What do you 
think of getting the princess a new dress or 
two ? " 

" O it would be very nice, Norton. She 
wants it." 

" Mamma will do that. Could you get it, 
Pink ? would you know how ? supposing 
your purse was long enough." 

" O yes, Norton. Of course I could ! " 

" Then you shall do it. Who will see to 
all the rest ? " 



 

" To buy the things, do you mean ? " 

" To buy them, and to choose them, and to 

get them to their place, and all that ? " 

" Why, you and I, Norton. Shan't we ? " 
" I think that is a good arrangement. The 

next question is, when? When shall we 

send the things there ? " 

" We must get the rooms cleaned. I will 

see about that. Then, Norton, the sooner 

the better ; don't you think so ? " 
" How is it in the fairy stories ? " 
" O, it's all done with a breath there ; that 

is one of the delightful things about it. You 

speak, and the genie comes ; and you tell him 

what you want, and he goes and fetches it ; 

there is no waiting. And yet, I don't know," 

Matilda added ; " I don't wish this could be 

done in a breath " 

" What ? " said a voice close behind her. 

The two looked up, laughing, to see Mrs. 

Laval. She was laughing too. 
" What is it, that is not to be done in a 

breath?" 




"Furnishing a palace, mamma (getting 
it cleaned first,) and setting up a princess." 

Mrs. Laval wanted to hear about it, and 
gradually she slipped down on the grass 
beside Matilda and drew an arm round her, 
while she listened to Norton's story. Norton 
made quite a story of it, and told his mother 
what Matilda had been doing the day before 
in Lilac lane, and what schemes they had 
presently on hand. Mrs. Laval listened 
curiously. 

" Dear, is it quite safe for you to go to such 
a place ? " she asked Matilda then. 

" O yes, ma'am." 

" But it cannot be pleasant." 

" O yes, ma'am ! " Matilda answered more 
earnestly. 

"How can it be?" 

" I thought it would not be pleasant, at 
first," said Matilda. "But I found it 
was." 

" What made it pleasant, dear ? " 

" If you saw the poor old woman, Mrs. 



 

Laval, and how much she wanted comfort, I 
think you would understand it." 

" Would you come and see me, if I wanted 
comfort? " the lady inquired. Matilda smiled 
at the possibility. Then something in Mrs. 
Laval's face reminded her that even with such 
a beautiful house and so rich abundance of 
things that money can buy, there might be a 
sad want of something that money cannot 
buy ; and she grew grave again. 

" Would you ? " Mrs. Laval repeated. 

And Matilda said yes. And Mrs. Laval 
again put her face down to Matilda's face and 
pressed her lips upon hers, again and again, 
as if she drew some sweetness from them. 
Not so passionately as the time before; yet 
with quiet earnestness. Then with one hand 
she stroked the hair from Matilda's forehead, 
and drew it forward, and passed her fingers 
through it ; caressing it in a tender, thoughtful 
way. Norton knelt on the grass beside them 
and looked on, watching and satisfied. Matilda was happy and passive. 



 

" Have you got money enough, love, for all 
you want to do ? " Mrs. Laval asked at 
length. 

" I haven't much," said Matilda ; " but 
Norton is going to help." 

" Have you got enough, Norton ? " 

" I guess so, mamma." 

Mrs. Laval put her hand in her pocket and 
drew out a little morocco pocket-book. She 
put it in Matilda's hand. 

" Norton shall not do it all," she said. "I 
don't know exactly how much is in this ; you 
can use what you choose on this fairy palace 
you and Norton are building." 

" O ma'am ! " Matilda began, flushing and 
delighted. Mrs. Laval stopped her mouth 
with a kiss. 

" But ma'am won't you please take out 
what you wish I should spend for Mrs. Eldridge " 

" Spend just what you like." 

" I might take too much," said Matilda. 

" It is all your's. Do just what you like 



 

with it. Spend what you like in Lilac lane, 
and the rest for something else." 

" O ma'am ! " Matilda began again in 
utter bewildered delight. 

" No, darling, don't say anything about 
it," Mrs. Laval answered, finding Matilda's 
pocket and slipping the pocket-book in. 
" You shall talk to me about it another time. 
I wish you could give me your secret." 

" What secret, ma'arn ? " said Matilda, 
who for the very delight that flushed her 
could hardly speak. 

" How to get so much satisfaction out of 
a little money." 

Matilda wished she could give Mrs. Laval 
anything that would do her a pleasure ; and 
she began to think, could she let her into this 
secret? It seemed a simple secret enough to 
Matilda; but she had a certain consciousness 
that for the great lady it might be more dif 
ficult to understand than it was for her. 
Was it possible that elegant pocket-book was 
in her pocket ? 




But now came the summons to tea, and 
they got up off the grass and went in. So 
beautiful a table Matilda had never seen ; and 
more thorough petting no little girl ever had. 
No one else was there but those three, so she 
was quite at home. Such a pleasant home 
it was, too. The windows all open, of the 
large, airy, pretty dining room ; the blue 
mountains seen through the windows at one 
side ; from the others, the green of the trees 
and the gay colours of flowers; the evening 
air drew gently through the room ; and 
flowers and fruit and all sorts of delicacies 
and all sorts of elegances on the table made 
Matilda feel she was in fairyland. 

" When are you coming again ? " said Mrs. 
Laval, taking her in her arms when she was 
about going. 

" Whenever you will let me, ma'am." 

" Could you learn to love me a little bit, 
some day? " 

Matilda did not know how to answer. 
She looked into the handsome dark eyes that 



 

were watching her, and with the thought of 
the secret sympathy between the lady and 
herself, her own watered. 

" I see you will," said Mrs. Laval kissing 
her. " Now kiss me." 

She sat quite still while Matilda did so ; 
then returned it warmly, and bade Norton 
take care of her home. 




CHAPTER V. 

MATILDA found her aunt, cousin and 
sister gathered in the parlour. 

" Well ! " said Maria. " I suppose you 
have had a time." 

" A good time ? " Mrs. Candy asked. 
Matilda replied yes. 

" You staid late," observed Clarissa. This 
did not seem to need an answer.
