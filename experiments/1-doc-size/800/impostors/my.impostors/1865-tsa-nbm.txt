ed for cheapness, and avarice conquered in almost ev 
ery instance, though Lydia was always on the side of 
taste and pride, and got wounds and bruises not a few 
in the contests. 



 

After the pain in parting with money in taking on a 
more expensive style of living, had in a measure subsid 
ed, our young merchant found a certain poor compen 
sation in contrasting himself with others. On his way 
to and from his business, he passed, daily, the modest 
little home of Doctor Hofland, with whom he main 
tained the outward signs of friendship when they hap 
pened to meet their visiting courtesies had ceased 
long ago and something of contempt for its mean 
ness, mingled with his pride. His prophecy in regard 
to the doctor's certain embarrassment had come true. 
Income and expenditure had not been rightly adjusted, 
and debt was the consequence. Once, under extremity, 
the doctor ventured to ask the tempoary loan of a hun 
dred dollars. He did not get the money, and never 
made a second application in that quarter. 

For the space of five years, Adam maintained him 
self with but few additions of furniture, in this second 
home. Lydia, whose maternal duties were blended 
with household cares, conducted her increased establish 
ment with notable economy, yet never to the satisfac 
tion of her husband. He supplied her but meagerly 
with money, and forced her, in consequence, to make 
bills at grocers, dry goods dealers, shoe makers, and so 
on, and scolded roundly when he had to pay them. He 
grumbled if fuel needed replenishing, and insisted that 
wood and coal were burned unnecessarily. A hundred 
mean little things were done in the line of economies 
that we cannot stop to particularize, and which made 
him contemptible in the eyes of servants, and, we might 
almost say, in the eyes of his wife also, from whose heart 



 

genuine love had long ago departed. .Adam Guy was 
a dictator and a supervisor in his household not a lov 
ing thought-taker for the comfort, contentment, and 
happiness of its inmates. He ministered to the wants of 
his family with a grudging, and not a liberal hand, and 
seemed to feel that every gush of free laughter among 
the children, or sign of pleasure on the face of his wife, 
was, in some incomprehensible way, a draught upon his 
guarded coffers and must be answered by a frown. 

The intense selfishness of Guy reproduced itself, by 
a natural law, in his children. All children are born 
with selfish inclinations ; but, according to the ruling 
desires and mental habits of their parents, which are 
reproduced in offspring, these inclinations are modified 
and counter-balanced in ways innumerable. Where a 
father gives himself to a single sordid idea, as was the 
case with Adam Guy, and pursues it steadily, day by 
day, carrying not only disregard, but contempt and dis 
like of others in his heart, he will transmit to his chil 
dren similar inclinations, which, if not weakened by op 
posite things from the mother, or repressed by discipline 
and education, must render them selfish in the extreme, 
and, as a consequence, antagonistic to each other. There 
cannot be love among such children. Their world is 
home, and they will, by the force of an inherited determ 
ination of soul, incline to have interests separate from this 
world, and to guard these interests with jealous care ; 
nay, as selfishness is at heart a robber, and they have 
no salutary fears of law, or social well-being to restrain 
them, trespass and wrong must follow ; and it did fol 
low among the children of Adam Guy. They were 
in conflict with each other from the beginning. 



 

Their father had no judgment in regard to family rule, 
and comprehended only the law of force. Of love, as 
a power, he had no conception. His discipline, therefore, 
was oftener hurtful than salutary. They did not seem 
to love, but to fear him ; and, as a consequence, always 
felt in a state of opposition to his commands. Thus the 
temptation to disobey was always before them, and they 
felt the power of few restraining influences. 

Adam, the oldest, inherited his father's love of accu 
mulation and hoarding, He was individualized among 
the children, in this particular, from the earliest period 
in which character began to manifest itself. If he re 
ceived a cent or a fi 'penny bit, he dropped it into his 
money-box, instead of spending it for candies or a toy. 
In this, he showed a quality after his father's own 
heart, and received more paternal commendations for 
his saving propensities, than for anything else. Thus 
love of money was stimulated, instead of being wisely 
repressed, as it always should be, where it shows itself 
in a child. The right use of money the sparing to 
spend wisely the love of accumulating for some useful 
end these should always be taught and cherished ; but 
the miserly spirit never ! For that will curse the pos 
sessor through life, and may destroy his soul eternally. 

John, the second child, had less of his father's decided 
characteristics. He resembled his mother in person, and 
mentally, showed many similar features ; but, selfishness 
was as predominant as in his older brother, manifesting 
itself not in avaricious hoarding, but in spending all that 
came into his hands for his own gratification. He nev 
er shared with his brothers or sisters. A cake, a candy 



 

or an apple, would be eaten and enjoyed by him in sight 
of their longing eyes, and not a crumb or a slice be di 
vided with them ! In this, he was unlike his mother. 
It was an image of his father's selfish soul, the trans 
mitted activities of which were only modified by new 
elements of character derived from her. In him was 
shadowed forth the selfish spendthrift. 

Lydia, the third child, was bright, active, and self- 
willed. A resolute trespasser on the rights of all, and 
almost always in sharp conflict with the rest, she had no 
true sensibility, no conscience using the word, as AVC of 
ten apply it to children who manifest little or no moral 
sense who are not truthful nor honest no native 
kindness of heart no love of anything out of herself. 
Edwin, Frances, and Philip, the three youngest chil 
dren showed leading characteristics quite as distinctly 
individual as their oldest brothers and sister. These 
will appear, as their lives are developed in the progress 
of our story. 

The mother's influence over her children was not of 
a decided character. It was irregular, indeterminate, 
and impulsive. She had lost her way in life and press 
ed forward, by a kind of necessity, through desolate 
and unfamiliar regions, with a never removed pressure 
of concern upon her breast, and a never appeased hun 
ger in her heart. The masculine strength of character 
on which she was to lean the wise intelligence that 
was to be her guide and polar-star these she had not 
found. Adam had proved, instead of the tender, 
loving husband, she had thought to gain, a hard master, 
to whose service she was irrevocably bound. A man 



 

the light ana warmth of intellectual sunshine. He 
would have been thought to her love, and thus she 
would have gained through him a higher region and a 
clearer vision. But, there was no intellectual or moral 
wisdom in Adam Guy, to which her soul could adjoin 
itself nothing that she could love and rest in, with 
the confiding truth of her nature ; and so, in compan 
ionship with him, she was astray, and in the dark, press 
ing onwards by the force of necessity, yet groping about, 
eagerly and impatiently at times, and again moving on 
in pulseless abandonment to what seemed a dark and 
cruel fate. 

No wonder that Lydia did not prove a wise mother, 
efficient for the training of her children; no wonder 
that she was weak, fretful, irresolute, and without sys 
tem in her management. Poor health came to increase 
her inefficiency. The exhaustion of her system, through 
the rapidly succeeding births of so many children, added 
to maternal cares and household duties, so enfeebled 
mind and body, that she was in no sense competent to 
fill the place she occupied ; and yet, no one could hold 
it but her. 

As in the beginning, Adam's will was the general 
law of the household, and in his prosperity he continued 
the same careful supervision of expenditure, treating his 
wife as if she had no right to a voice in anything where 
his darling gold was concerned. 

Thus it was with them, after ten years of married 
life. Alas for the golden hopes, which had made all 
these desolate cycles beautiful in the future of Lydia, on 
the day she laid her maiden hand so trustingly in that 
of Adam Guy, and called him husband ! 




CHAPTER IX. 



HERE had been a second change in 
the external of Guy's life in the world, 
up to the period of which we are now 
writing. He accumulated steadily, and 
pride as a merchant demanded that he 
should live in better style. He felt 
himself becoming of more consequence 
every day it was purse-proud con 
sequence, the meanest kind of basis on 
which to build self-estimation and it was needful, 
therefore, to assume an exterior, in some degree suited 
to his mercantile status. Rising men, whom he now 
met in the walks of trade, talked of houses, furniture, 
crrriages, and country-seats, in a way that dwarfed his 
modest house into meanness. 

A change followed. From the retired part of the 
city, in which he had lived for seven years, he removed 
to a more fashionable quarter, and took a house at seven 
hundred dollars a year, expending over two thousand 
in refurnishing. It went something against the grain, 
this outlay of money and increased expenses, but pride 
was the goad that pricked him onward. 

Let us take some three years subsequent to this change, 
a closer view of Adam Guy's home. Let us open the 



 

door of his fine residence, and go in and sit down with 
him, amid his wife and children. 

It is evening. Through the whole day, Mr. Guy's 
thoughts had flowed in the one direction of business ; 

c? 

and so eager had been . the purpose which made these 
thoughts active, that, in more than a single instance, 
they struck with disturbing force against hindrances or 
impossibilities. This was no unusual thing, for the pur 
poses and thoughts of our grasping merchant were al 
ways in advance of the orderly results of business. 

Adam Guy came home in a dissatisfied state of mind, 
consequent on several causes. There had been a decline 
in the sugar market ; two or three large cargoes having 
arrived at New York, prices had receded a quarter of a 
cent. Their firm held a thousand barrels, in anticipa 
tion of a rise. Of course he was disturbed. The dif 
ference of a quarter of a cent a pound on a thousand 
barrels was a serious matter ; but, what if there should 
be a further and heavier decline ! Another cause of dis 
turbance was the failure of a merchant in Virginia, 
who was indebted to them over three thousand dollars. 
No intelligence had been received as to the character of 
this failure ; but the worst is iisually feared in all such 
cases. Mr. Guy feared the worst. Then a good custom 
er, to whom they had been selling for years, had gone 
over to a rival house, which had offered eight, instead 
of the usual six months' credit. But we will enumerate 
no farther. To a man whose ruling passion was the love 
of money, and who thought and worked only to that end, 
these were enough to make bitter for that day the wine 
of life. And so Adam Guy came home at its clos, with 



 

knit brows, shut lips, and a feeling of angry impatience 
in his heart, toward everything that came in his way. 
A pale, unhappy looking woman, -sitting amidst a 
group of noisy children, lifted her eyes, half timidly, 
half hopefully, as if dreaming of a smile that once- 
came with the music of familiar steps, to the face of 
Adam Guy as he entered. His knit brows and tightly 
shut lips, threw their shadow instantly over her counte 
nance. The feeble light, which had flickered there for a 
moment, went out. There was no cry of joy among 
the children as their father entered, but a sudden sup 
pression of voices. He did not speak, but moved to a 
large easy chair, and sitting down, dropped his chin upon 
his breast, and let his thoughts go back to his gold and 
his merchandise. In a little while the children's hushed 
tones came out ao;ain, and filled the ears of their father 
with a disturbing clamor. 

" Silence ! " The word came in deep, commanding 
utterance. 

Stillness reigned for several moments. Then low 
whisperings began, increasing to a murmur, that soon 
rose to wild discord again. Loudest among the mingling 
voices, were those of Adam, the oldest boy, and Lydia, 
the 'oldest of the two girls. Adam was a favorite with 
his father, because, of all the children, he showed hope 
ful qualities. Thrift was foreshadowed in his regard for 
money. Toward Lydia, on the contrary, he always 
seemed to bear ill-will. Nothing that the child could do, 
appeared to 'meet his approbation. Scarcely an evening 
passed, that she was not ordered to leave his presence, 
and, unless she conducted herself with signal circuin- 


spection, the same thing occurred at almost every meal. 
This discrimination against Lydia was regarded by 
Mrs. Guy as unjust, and she often had sharp words 
with her husband in consequence, and not unfrequently 
in presence of the children. On this occasion, as the 
voice of Adam and Lydia rose, in contention, the father 
said, peremptorily 

" Lydia ! Go out of the room ! " 

" And Adam, do you go also !" spoke out the mother. 

Adam looked toward his father, and hesitated ; Lydia 
moved back a few paces, and then stood still, looking at 
her mother. 

" Did you hear me ? " The heavy jar of Mr. Guy's 
foot gave emphasis to his word. Lydia started, and 
receded towards the door. 

" Adam ! Didn't I tell you to leave the room ? " 

Mrs. Guy spoke sharply. The boy not moving, still 
looked at his father, and seeing no command in his eyes, 
remained firm. 

" Go, sir,this instant ! " The stamp of Mrs. Guy's 
small foot was added to her voice. 

" Why do you send him out ? " Mr. Guy turned, 
frowningly, upon his wife. 

" Because he's equally in fault with Lydia. " 

" No, I'm not ! I didn't do anything! It's all her ! 

She's the worst girl that ever lived ! " Thus Adam, 
reading his father's eyes, and having the memory of past 
things before him, came out in his own defence. 

" She's a great deal better than you are, sir a great 
deal better ! " Poor Mrs. Guy's self-control and pru 
dence were all gone. In her weakness, standing alone as 



 

she did, she was borne down by the pressure of indignant 
feelings. Lydia still remained near the door, awaiting 
the result of this diversion made in her favor. En 
couraged by her mother's defence, she flung back upon 
Adam a stinging retort, which he returned, with interest 
added. A movement by her father, that Lydia well 
understood, caused a hasty retreat from this field of 
unequal combat ; she passed through the door, shutting 
it after her, and retired to a region of greater safety. 

" It isn't just to make her the scape-goat of every 
wrong done in the house," said Mrs. Guy, speaking 
indignantly, and looking with angry eyes upon her 
husband. He made no answer beyond a contemptuous 
curl of the lip, and letting his chin droop again, looked 
away from the present disquietude to the more impor 
tant matters of his merchandise. Adam did not leave 
the room, and was soon engaged in wrangling with his 
brother John, who, in turn, followed ]iis sister into tem 
porary banishment. 

The supper scene was one of usual discord. The un 
disciplined children were restless, noisy, and conten 
tious, and their father ill-natured beyond his wont. Lydia, 
John, and little three-year-old Frances, were sent from 
the table and to bed. Adam, who deserved banishment 
quite as much as the rest, maintained his place, though 
vigorously assailed by his mother, and ordered by her 
to follow his brother and sister. Only his father's word, 
when his father was present made law for him. 

Later in the evening, after all the children were in 
bed, Mrs. Guy broke in upon her husband's silent medi 
tations on the subject of loss and gain, with the sen 
tence, 



 

" Have you twenty dollars in your pocket-book ? " 

" No. What do you want with twenty dollars ? " 
Mr. Guy started from his reverie, and moved his person 
uneasily. 

" I have use for it," was coldly answered. 

" Didn't I give you ten dollars yesterday ? " demand 
ed Mr. Guy. 

" Yes ; but I paid the milk-man's bill." 

" How much was his bill ? " 

" Six dollars." 

" Well, you had four left ? " 

" I bought sundry little matters." 

" Sundry little matters ! O yes ! Sundries cost more 
than any thing else. Sundries eat out the life of all 
prosperity. I would discharge a clerk who made an 
entry of sundries in one of my account books. Sun 
dries ! I hate the word ! " 

" Well, Mr. Guy," Lydia drew herself up somewhat 
haughtily, and spoke firmly and with covert sarcasm in 
her voice. " I will particularize. There were four 
yards of gingham for aprons seventy cents ; tape, 
sewing cotton, needles and pins fifty cents ; a pair of 
scissors forty-five cents ; four yards of bonnet ribbon 
a dollar and a half " 

" There, there ! That will do ! " broke in Mr. Guy, 
impatiently. " I thought there'd be ribbons, or some 
sort of finery, in the case. It's money, money, all the 
while a regular drain. A man might as well pour 
water into a sieve." 

Mrs. Guy looked down at the sewing on which she 
was engaged, and made no answer. Mr. Guy kept on. 



 

" I received Yardly & Co.'s bill to-day." 

" Well." Mrs. Guy did not look up. 

" How much do you suppose it is ? " 

" I've not the least idea." 

" You haven't ? Upon my word ! If you haven't 
any idea, I wonder who should ? Didn't you buy the 
goods ?" 

" I presume so." 

" Two hundred and twenty-two dollars and sixty-five 
cents, madam ! A bill, as long as my arm ! " 

And Mr. Guy drew forth the bill, and displayed it 
before the eyes of his wife, saying, as he did so 

" Look at that ! " 

Mrs. Guy, after taking it from his hands, went over, 
item by item, slowly and thoughtfully. 

" It's correct as to the articles and prices," she said, 
in a quiet tone. 

" It is ! " 

" Yes, sir." 

" Then I call you an extravagant woman, Lydia ! 
A bill for dry goods of nearly two hundred and fifty 
dollars in less than six months." 

" There are six children and myself to clothe, Mr. 
Guy ; and if you will glance at the bill you will see 
twenty-six dollars charged for linen that was made up 
into shirts for yourself. Now, it strikes me, sir, as 
being a very moderate account." 

" Moderate ! " And Mr. Guy, who had taken the 
bill from his wife's hand, tossed it from him in angry 
contempt. " It's nothing but money, money, moey 
morning, noon, and night ! I can't turn, but the word 



 

money is flung into my ears ! I dread coming home, 
half of my time, for so sure as I cross my own thresh 
old, the cry of money is heard. The horse leech's 
daughter were a companion to be " 

" Adam, take care ! " Mrs. Guy turned on her hus 
band suddenly. She had been spurred into reaction so ' 
many times that a defiant spirit had crept into her 
heart. Love went out long and long ago. 

The tone and look of his wife caused Mr. Guy to 
pause, and hold back the words that were on the lip of 
utterance. 

" Take care of what ? " he growled, ill-naturedly. 

" You might go too far," said Ills wife, with cold res 
olution in her voice. 

" You talk in riddles ; I don't understand you ; .speak 
out in plain language when you address me.'' Mr. 
Guy's tones were contemptuous. But his wife uttered 
no further word. She had him at bay, and that was 
sufficient. To contend was no part of her nature, 
though smarting assault often roused her into temporary 
reaction, and there was. at times, a quality in her reac 
tion which had so threatening a look to Mr. Guy that 
he held himself back from a final encounter. It was so 
in the present case. 

Turning himself partly away from his wife, and drop 
ping his chin again upon his bosom, Mr. Guy went 
back to his gold and his merchandise. A silence of 
over ten minutes followed, when a servant opened the 
door of the room in which they were sitting. Mrs. 
Guy looked up, and seeing who it was, said 

" Very well, Jane ; I'll see you in a moment." 



 

The girl, who was dressed to go out, retired. 

" Adam, I want ten dollars for Jane," said Mrs. 
Guy. 

" Ten dollars ! You don't owe the girl so much as 
that?" 

" Yes ; and I promised her that she should have it to 
night." 

~ 

Mr. Guy drove his hand into his pocket, and taking 
out a purse, selected therefrom a ten dollar bill. 

" There ! " he said, thrusting it toward his wife. 
" And I wish you'd have some regard to my demands. 
I've said, a hundred times, that I wanted the girls 
paid every week. Don't let this occur again." 

" Give me a certain reasonable amount regularly, and 
I'll see that everything is paid as I go along," returned 
Mrs. Guy. 

"What do you call a reasonable amount? " 

" A sum equal to our household expenses." 

" That's very indefinite," said Mr. Guy. 

" You know about what it costs us in the year." 

" I know that it costs us a great deal more than it 
should." 

" Perhaps it does ; but that's neither here nor there. 
Take our expenses for the last year, and divide the 
sum by fifty-two. This will give you the amount of 
our weekly expenses. Place that in my hands regular 
ly, and I'll see that you are not annoyed by these con 
stant demands for money." 

Mr. Guy did not respond. The proposition had 
often been made before, but he had a fancy that his 
wife would, under this arrangement, spend with a more 



 

liberal hand, and run up heavy dry goods' bills into the 
bargain. He loved his money too well to trust it with 
her in any sums beyond tens or twenties ; too well to let 
it pass from his hands without grave intimations of its 
value. With the instinct of his avaricious nature, he 
saw that if he set apart a certain sum weekly, and hand 
ed it to his wife, as a thing of course, she would hold 
on to it with less tenacity than if every renewal of her 
purse were attended by remonstrances, interrogatories, 
and lectures on waste and extravagance. " Women 
don't know the value of money," was one of his favorite 
self-justifications ; and be acted up to this settlement in 
all his dealings with his wife. 

" I want ten dollars more," said Mrs. Guy, seeing 
that her husband made no response to her proposition. 
Her voice was firm, and just a little sharp with impa 
tience. 

Mr. Guy dashed his hand into his pocket again. 

" There ! " An angry frown darkened his face as he 
handed Lydia another bank bill. " It's nothing but 
money ! " he muttered, almost savagely, as he arose to 
his feet, and commenced stalking about the room. His 
wife retired silently. 

The scene we have presented is a simple illustration 
of the home-life of Mr. and Mrs. Guy. Love, as we 
have said, had died out long ago, and in its place was 
hard antagonism. Truly had Guy expressed the 
thought and interest by which they were bounded, when 
he said " It's nothing but money ! " Beyond or 
above this the wings of his spirit had not power to lift 
him ; and fettered by his life bound to a sordid earth- 



 

clod Lydia could not get above the limitations of a 
sphere to which a base marriage had doomed her. He 
was ever holding back his yellow dross ; she, from the 
necessities of her position, ever grasping after it. And 
so, the finer qualities of her nature all her tastes 
all her aspirings after higher things all her loves and 
humanities were stifled, overlaid, or extinguished. 



The promise of her young, sweet life, was rendered 
fruitless. Beauty had turned to ashes. 

So we find it with Adam Guy and his wife after the 
lapse of ten years. How few of those who envied their 
wealth and style of living, dreamed of all the hollow 
mockery by which they were surrounded. They had 
money, but at what a price ! 




CHAPTER X. 



EN years have laid their burdens and 
their lessons on the hearts of Doctor 
Hofland and his wife, as well. They 
have not found it all meadow-path and 
sunshine. Rough places have woun 
ded their feet, and storms have found 
them far distant from sheltering rock 
or hiding covert. But, in all trial, 
disappointment, anxiety, and affliction 
their hearts have drawn nearer and nearer together, 
gaining, at each approach, more unity of pulsation. 

A defect in the character of Doctor Hofland was 
lack of worldly prudence. The absence of all sordid 
qualities left him in danger of setting too light a value 
on money ; and the absorption of thought in his profes 
sion, kept his mind away from a due consideration of 
life's economies, without which it is almost impossible 
for a man, solely dependent on his own efforts, to keep 
himself free from embarrassment. He was too apt to 
let want, and not means, rule in the matter of expen 
diture. The tastes of such a man are costly things, 
and, if gratified, absorb money rapidly. 

We find the doctor and his wife living in a pleasant 
house on Charles street, among merchants, bankers, and 



 

men of property, and in a style indicative of profession 
al thrift. His practice has largely increased, for, in 
addition to his acknowledged skill, he has personal qual 
ities that render him popular. Pass we into his home. 
Let us contrast the parlors with those of Adam Guy, 
who is worth at least forty thousand dollars the doc 
tor's account with the world, we are sorry to say, stands 
seriously against him. In the merchant's parlors, we 
find lace and damask curtains, Brussels carpet, rich 
mantel glasses, pier-tables, and maroon velvet furniture. 
These, looking cold, stiff, and stately, suggest only a 
money value. You think of what they cost not of 
their use in the household. No pictures smile down up 
on you from the walls ; no urn or vase, no bronze or 
Parian statut-tte, gives grace, tenderness, or human beau 
ty. You might as well be in a cabinet maker's show 
room, for all the sentiment of home that is inspired. 
You stand now in two smaller rooms, communicating 

by folding doors, and a home-feeling is penetrating 
your heart. These are the parlors of our friend, the 
doctor. Instead of damask and lace curtains, we find 
simple Venitian, window-blinds. There are no glasses 
in the piers, and only a small one on the mantel in the 
front parlor ; a hair cloth sofa stands in one room, and 
a piano in the other ; the carpets are ingrain, and the 
chairs cane-seat. But, there are many things beyond 
these, and your eyes go to them instinctively. Here 
hangs a landscape, that gives you a dream of summer 
never to be forgotten, and there a home scene of exqui 
site tenderness. You smile now at the humor of a pic 
ture that hits off a foible of character, and take the les- 



 

son to yourself or, more likely, apply it to another. 
From wall to wall you pass, lingering before painting 
and engraving, and drinking in beauty and sentiment. 
Then you turn to examine a small bronze figure of Ca- 
nova's Dancing Girl, which stands on the mantel, and go 
from this to an exquisite Hebe. On the two centre- 
tables, you find rare books, rich in art-treasure the 
wealth of European galleries. 

But these are not obtainable by any small outlay of 
money. A piece of canvas, two feet square, may cost 
more than a gilded mirror ; and the wall adornments of 
two small parlors, like those of Doctor Hofland, absorb 
a larger sum than all the damask, rose-wood, and French 
plate in the drawing-rooms of a merchant-prince. Art 
is expensive. It was actually so in the present case. 
These pictures, books, statuettes, and other articles of 
taste, cost more than all the handsome furniture in 
Adam Guy's parlors. You look grave at this and will 
look graver still, when we tell you that our pleasant 
friends, Dr. Hofland and his wife, are enjoying these 
rare and costly things at the price of debt ! Trying to 
enjoy them, it were better said, for, with such a 
drawback, minds like theirs can have no real enjoyment. 

Do not blame them too severely, for, at heart, they 
are not dishonest. Of set purpose, they would wrong 
none. Good deeds and kindness have marked each step 
of their way through life, These costly things which 
you see, have been gathered, one at a time, all through 
the ten years that have elapsed since you first looked in 
upon them. The sum of their price has never been 
thought of; if you were to ask their aggregate money- 



 

value, they would not answer correctly, within hundreds 
of dollars. Debt has come by gradual advances, year 
after year, as expenditure steadily exceeded income ; and 
now, when the close calculating merchant is worth forty 
thousand dollars, the physician is " worse than nothing," 
by at least three thousand. 

As we gave you a near view of the home-life of 
Adam Guy, after the lapse of ten years, we will now let 
you see how it is with Doctor Hofland and his wife. 
They have had five children. Of these, two have pass
