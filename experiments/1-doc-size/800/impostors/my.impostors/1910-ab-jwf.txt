something that was his and yet not his, used to writhe in 
his chair under the feeling that the idea had become so im- 
personal to her that she might offer it at any time, in any 
company. 

" Beautiful ! " his sister would dutifully respond, because 
the rule of the house was that mother, because she was mother 



 





and had a stiff knee, m\ist be indulged. Lovell thought that 
had got him into his habit of biting his lips, a vice he pursued 
until his mother noted it and watched him for its recurrence, 
saying at each downfall, " Don't do that, my son. You have 
a beautiful mouth." 

Well, he thought, the mouth was there. It was sufficiently 
firm, even after all it had gone through. It was well enough. 
The chin was finely cut, and he elected to pay no attention 
to the dimple in it. What he chiefly wished to see was whether 
he looked in the main no worse, if no better, than other fel- 
lows who might not have had his own tawdry experience. The 
lamp gave him no ecstatic assurance, but it offered no facers, 
and he went to bed, to forget himself and what he was pretty 
sure was going to be the morrow's foolish deed. 

But the next afternoon it was without thinking much about 
it, except as an act already determined upon, that, in all the 
austerity of his conventional gear, he went up to the Win- 
terbournes' and knocked. He had been used to walking in, 
after the familiar custom of the town, for his lost evenings 
with Wintcrbourne and the Greeks; but those were behind 
him. He never hoped for them again, and saw before him 
the exacting call of a new relation miserably veiled, as yet, in 
doubt. 

Lyddy came limping to the door, and stared at him with 
a frank surprise. Perhaps if he had not looked her in the 
eye and asked somewhat more severely than anything save a 
wavering will, giving itself even the advantage of a truculent 
port, might have counselled, she would have frankly told him 
how he seemed to her in his new clothes. But she informed 
him in detail where all the family might be found. Mr. Win- 
terbourne and Bess — she made no halt at her familiar name 
— were studying in the sitting-room, Mrs. Wintcrbourne 
had gone to town with that Mrs. Ramsay, and Miss Celia was 



 





in the garden. Lovell hesitated before her, and she divined 
him. 

" You can go out this way, if you want," she said, her 
gleaming eye on his. " She 's the only one that ain't busy.'' 

So Lovell went through the kitchen and down the steps 
of the back door and came upon Celia pacing dreamily in the 
spring air, between rows of budding green. The garden, like 
all the Winterbourne estate, had suffered in the desertion of 
the owner, and he had not yet haled this flowery patch back 
to an assured prosperity. Bess had been digging about some 
of the perennials, and Hunter, seeing her, had brought his 
hoe and gone into the business of liberation, to please her. 
Finding him at work, she had given no sign of gratitude or 
even interest, but he was pleased to note that her own frag- 
mentary toil went on there in early mornings before he came. 
She it was who had decreed the sowing of lawn-grass near the 
house, where Winterbourne had elected to raise carrots. Win- 
terbourne had come out one morning and found Hunter sow- 
ing grass. 

" You told me the carrots were all in," the master said, 
with dark suspicion. 

Hunter kept on with his accurate wave and toss of the seed. 

"Yes," he said. "This is grass-seed." 

Winterbourne felt one of his rages coming on, but at that 
moment Bess walked around the corner of the house. He 
appealed to her : — 

"Will you listen to this? I tell this fellow to put in car- 
rots—" 

But Bess came up to him. Her hair was blowing, and the 
light of day was in her eyes. 

"Why, yes," said she, " course you 've got to have grass- 
seed up here by the house. I told him so. You can't plant 
carrots round your rock-o'-door." 



 





That was an old term for the doorstep. Lyddy made a 
commonplace of it, and Winterbourne loved the girl for us- 
ing it in the manner of the soil. He looked at her a moment, 
broadly smiling, and she smiled bade, in no community of 
understanding mirth, but because she approved of him. 
So the lawn was sown, and Winterbourne rejoiced in his 
defeat. 

Celia had no inborn taste for gardens : but this one, en- 
closed in its high fence, gave space for solitary musing, and 
she wandered up and down, looking the sweetest of lone 
maidens, but brooding practically on ways and means. Lov- 
ell, a little dashed because she did not know him, went to- 
ward her fast, and suddenly she did place him, and held out 
her hand. 

" How good of you to find me," she said. " I might have 
missed you." 

Lovell had perhaps not himself realized how deeply in 
earnest he was. He kept her hand a moment and threw it 
away from him with a little fling, as if he abjured all the helps 
to courage. But after all, what had he to say to her ? Could 
he begin, " I have chosen to confess to you, because you arc 
a beautiful young woman and I am afraid you will not be 
pleased"? 

" It is so warm," Celia was saying, in a clear voice tuned 
to his insufficient hearing. 

She looked at him with large and reflective eyes, thinking, 
in the undercurrent that went on in her now all the time, that 
here was a unit of the millions more fortunate than she and 
bound to serve her if she could but combine them rightly, 
knowing he was predisposed toward her and wondering how 
she might take the best advantage of the moment. The be- 
ginning was to talk to him. '' Come down into the grape 
arbor," she said. " I 'vc been sitdng there." 



 




He followed her, his throat dry with indignation against 
himself for walking into a corner where he must needs ap- 
pear like a fool to get out again. In the arbor she sank into 
one of the wicker chairs, looked at him with her pleasant 
smile, which was yet not warm, and waited. He took in her 
look, like a picture hung before him, the slenderness of her, 
the pretty dress with its light green stripe and the green rib- 
bon at her waist, the warmth of her hair, and the pure out- 
line of her cheek. He felt dizzily for a moment that he did 
not know whether he had spoken or not, and then said, in 
what instantly sounded to him like a voice too rough, — 
. " You don't know me." 

Celia was still looking at him with that cool, clear smile. 

" I know you are a poet," she said in a low voice, and 
asked herself inwardly, in that unconscious way she had of 
referring all her words ahd acts to a standard of aesthetic mean- 
ing, whether the tone had been thrilling enough to fit that 
word. 

He made a slight outward motion of the hands, as if all 
that he cast to the abyss of unconsidered things where tal- 
ents, genius even, might lie while he sought the mere basis 
for human living. 

"Don't say that," he adjured her. "Has anybody told 
you anything about me?" 

Immediately that seemed to him asinine, because there 
was no reason why anybody should have spoken of him. 
But she was smiling at him in a bewildering way and assur- 
ing him that they had. All the time she was wondering, in 
a disengaged inner chamber of her brain, what he had done 
with the money they said he threw away. It seemed the 
height of folly or the top of splendor to throw away money 
Bess could use to such advantage. 

" I could understand," she told him. " I understand pcr- 



 





fcctly. That 's exactly how a poet would feel. I 'm awfully 
proud of myself because I could partly understand." 

He stared at her in an unbelieving gratitude. She must 
mean, he knew, that old plague spot in his life, the young 
folly that had helped bewilder his mother's days, and had 
bound his sister to him in a passionate desire to make up 
to him for the world's odium. The money he was said to 
have abjured was as far from his thought as any other in- 
considerable thing that might have plagued him, for a mo- 
ment, to be forgotten. But here, it seemed, was the most 
delicate spirit of the spring bringing its own gentlest fra- 
grant air to blow about his past and make all well. 

" That 's not all," he said. " Those things — that thing — 
is past and gone. It 's an infernal folly I came to talk to 
you about — about my being deaf I 'm not deaf." 

She was staring at him in a sweet confusion. It was 
Celia's endowment that, whatever seemed desirable to feel, 
she could really compass for the moment. 

" Oh ! " she said, in a maiden shame that implied the 
memory of the admiring comment she had thrown out that 
other day. 

He did not make the least pretence at not remembering, 

" I heard it," he said. He was rather pale now, and 
looking directly at her. " That 's why I came. When you 
said it, I felt like a fool. But I thought I 'd better tell you. 
I wanted to be an honest fool, at least." 

She sat looking at him with her air of restrained emotion, 
really wondering what he would like her to say. She had 
divined the spring of humor in him, and suddenly her face 
crinkled into laughter. She stretched out both hands to 
him, not, he found at once when he put out his own to 
take them, in more than a spontaneous gesture of her own, 
having nothing to do with him. But as she withdrew them 



 





before his hands could meet them, there seemed to be no- 
thing incomplete in the action but, on the contrary, some- 
thing very pretty. 

" It 's so fiinny ! " she murmured. " Isn't it fanny to 
you ? What made you do- it ? " 

His face relaxed, but rather grimly. 

" I didn't do it to be fanny," he said briefly. " I can't 
explain it to you. But I 'd got mortal tired of talking. That 
seemed to be one way of getting out of it." 

" But aren't you tired any more ? Are you willing to talk 
now?" 

Her charming face, still creased into mirth, was set upon 
him with its divided beauty of wistfal eyes and smiling 
lips. Now he was openly answering the smile. 

" I don't know that I particularly want to talk," he 
owned, seeking through his inner store of reasons. " But I 
look mighty foolish to myself for hatching it up." 

" I wonder why," she reflected. She was sitting now, 
hands clasped over her knees, looking at him musingly. 

" Well, you 're a new person," said Lovell, selecting the 
outside of such reasons as he found. " You 've come in 
here and brought your verdicts with you. You turned a 
light on me. I look like a fool, that 's all I know." 

" Oh, not a fool," she hastened, " a poet." 

At that he frowned, and she knew at once she was snap- 
ping that string too boldly. Her face broke up again into 
smiling. 

"It's funny," she declared. "It's awfally fanny. Don't 
be sorry you did it. I wouldn't have missed it for the 
worid." 

"Don't be sorry I've been deaf?" he said good-hu- 
moredly, getting on his feet, and looking down at her. 
"Well, I'll try not. Only you can remember I 'm not deaf 



 





any more, I 've got back my hearing. That 's what old 
Mrs. Staples said when Winterbourne sent her a trumpet." 

"How did he send her a trumpet? Sit down and tell 
me." 

That was a new pretext for keeping him. But Lovell 
did not sit down. He walked a few steps through the arbor 
and broke off a twig. With this in his hand, to snap again 
into infinitesimal lengths, he felt more at ease. He had ner- 
vous hands that communicated their needs swiftly to his 
brain. 

" Oh, I don't know exactly how it was. Only she came 
here — no, her daughter came a while ago and demanded 
an ear-trumpet. He happened to have one on hand ; so he 
gave it to her." 

" What a curious thing to have on hand ! You speak as 
if it were a pencil or a piece of soap ! " 

" It is curious, but that 's the way it was." 

She was looking up at him, her fiice brimming over, and 
before knowing what brought its accession of mirth, he 
smiled back at it. 

" You could say he happened to have another ear-trumpet 
round," she hinted, " or a sovereign remedy for ears, and 
that 's what cured you. That's why you aren't hard of hear- 
ing any more." 

He started. 

" My king! " said he, "You don't mean to tell me I 've got 
to stop being deaf? " 

" But you 've confessed it. So you 're not deaf, are 
you?" 

He shook his head in a droll bewilderment. 

" I never thought it was going to let me out of the advan- 
tage I'd gained. If I had—" 
" You wouldn't have done it ? " she challenged him. 



 



" I should have thought twice." 

"Well ! " Instantly she sobered into a sympathetic tender- 
ness, and Lovell felt small and young. " It would be a shame 
to take it away now you 've got used to it. I'll tell you what 
we'll do. You shall be deaf to all the rest and not to me." 

It was said with an air of bright discovery, and Lovell al- 
most shouted, he was so pleased with it. 

" That's exactly it," he assured her. "That 's what I should 
like above all. So you see it 's brought me luck." 

"What luck?" 

" Why, we 've got a secret together. Maybe you don't call 
that luck. I do." He sobered, and his voice showed softened 
recollection. "It 's brought me luck before this." 

"What, Mr. Lovell?" 

"Well, it brought Winterbourne. He heard I was deaf, 
and what does the old dog do but bring me down a trumpet, 
the twin to old Mrs. Staples's. When I saw him and his hon- 
est phiz and the trumpet in his hand — well, I laughed, but 
I could have cried. But I asked him in, and we had it out 
together, and you might have heard him roar from here to 
Dixie." He paused there, looked reflective, then looked fool- 
ish, and added, " He left the trumpet though — and to-day 
I brought it back." 

"To-day ? now ? You haven't it with you? " 

He nodded and took out pan-pipes from his pocket, the 
innocent-looking little wonder-worker that to-day every body 
knows the outline of. Celia put out her hand for it, regarded 
it curiously, and set it to her ear. 

"No," said Lovell, "it 's not for you." 

But he gazed at her with a keen regard, tenderly even, and 
wished he had some artist's immortal presentment of her as 
she looked then, like youth or beauty holding the shell to 
her ear, listening to — what? Time, perhaps, the presage of 



 


eternity. But when the delicate pose had lasted long enough, 
she was looking at him, at last, and smiling. 

" Could you hear the grass grow?" he asked her. 

"Almost." 

" I 'm going to let you laugh at me again," said Lovell. 
" I 'm so unused to making calls, I wanted a reason. I took 
the trumpet. I thought if I found you all together I 'd make 
that the pretence. But if I found you alone I should just 
offer my confession and be absolved." 

"And what shall I do with the trumpet?" She was look- 
ing at it drolly now, as if such helps to living were jokes to 
her immortal youth. " Keep it to hear the grass grow ? " 

" Give it to Winterbourne, if you will, and sec he puts it 
away. It 's too valuable to be left lying round." 

Celia came to her feet, because she saw he was really going. 
Besides she felt him to be cleverer than she, and the inter- 
view was, she felt, being left at precisely the right point. 

" Well, we 've got our secret," she said brightly. " It makes 
me feel about five." 

Lovell shook his head. 

" I feel mpre than five," he told her. " Sometimes I feel 
about seventy-five. But I don't object to a secret. Listen. 
I 'm going to prove to you that I 'm not deaf." 

" But you told me." 

"I 'm going to prove it. I'll tell you what is going to 
happen in a minute. Your sister has run up into the shed- 
chamber. I heard her speak to Lyddy, and then step on that 
first creaking stair. Winterbourne is coming. I smell his to- 
bacco. Tim Ramsay is coming in through your side gate. I 
heard him shoo the cat. Now I 'm off. Good-by." 

He looked about him, evidently for a way of escape that 
should not bring him face to face with the incursion he had 
foretold, saw the clear place in the fence where the grapevine 



 





had not found the top, and, regardless of new clothes, went 
over. Celia, remembering his face as it had smiled upon 
her, decided that he did more than refrain from objecting to 
a secret. He liked it very much. 

Winterbourne, true to prophecy, appeared in the doorway, 
smoking his pipe. 

" O papa," Celia called to him, " here's your ear-trumpet." 



 



XIV 

WINTERBOURNE advanced, smiling wryly, and 
Tim, who had followed him through the dining- 
rpom, came on behind. 

" I begin to think," said Wintcrbournc, " that if I opened 
the almanac at random, I should find in the margin, 'About 
this time look out for car-trumpets.' What 's the thing pur- 
suing me for? Where 'd you get it, Celia?" 

" Mr. Lovell brought it. Isn't it wonderful, papa? " 

Winterbourne smiled quizzically at her. By this time he 
knew her trick of pretty, unmeaning speech. Tim had taken 
pan-pipes out of his hand, and went round in a mock excite- 
ment, listening at the region supposedly of Winterbourne's 
heart, and then at a spider's web where a fly was buzzing. But 
Winterbourne, his eyes drawn that way, lifted the fly out of 
the web of doom, delicately unwound the threads with his 
great fingers, and set him free. Celia, watching him, found it 
an attractive thing to have done, and wondered why she 
hadn't thought of it. 

" Listen," she said to Tim. " You can hear the grass grow." 

" There 's only one place where you can hear the grass 
grow," said Winterbourne. His face took on that soft, fine 
look it had when his mind travelled miles and miles at light- 
ning rate, to unknown beauties whereof it knew the secret 

" Where is that, papa ? " 

"It's in Schubert's Frublingsglaube. I swear you can hear 
the roots." 

''I 'm going to make your sister sing into this thing," Tim 
announced. 



 





" Simple Simon," said Wintcrbourne, " pan-pipes isn't for 
you. Wait fifty odd years till you 've grown to it." 

"What is there so grand about the thing anyway?" Tim 
wondered. " What makes it so much better than any other 
trumpet?" 

But Winterbourne had no notion of talking mechanism 
with the feckless loon he thought Timothy to be. Besides 
he was telling Celia something. 

" I wish I 'd known Lovell was here. He 's done me an 
ill turn." 

" No, papa, not really ? " 

" Lovell hasn't printed anything for years, and now he 's 
gone and written up the Valley of Birds, and sent it to the 
Sunr 

"Now what is the Valley of Birds, papa?" 

Tim was wandering about, directing pan-pipes here and 
there, and finally mounting the kitchen steps. 

" Put that in the drawer of my desk when you 're done 
with it," Winterbourne called. " The upper right-hand little 
drawer." 

He, too, was preparing to wander away, for he was not at 
ease in solitude with Celia. Her comments, her questions, 
were after a prearranged model. Bess, he would have said, 
had the old habit of wonder. She belonged to the childhood 
of the race. She was unspoiled. 

" But the Valley of Birds ? " Celia reminded him. 

" Well ! " he paused to make a story of it. " You see the 
lower part of my land, down there where the carrots are, 
opens into a lane and the lane leads to a good big stretch of 
woods. They're first-growth pine. They're monarchs. 
You 've got to bow the knee. But before you get in among 
them there 's a fringe of light wood, birch, poplar. Just 
about now it's divine. Well, inside the shade the birds seem 



 





to know they can have it their own way. They come earlier 
there, they sing louder, they seem to sing longer in the year. 
I 've called it the Valley of Birds, that 's all." 

" But what's Mr. Lovell done to it? " 

" Why, the devil possessed him, and he's written a pretty 
essay about it and told where it is, the fool, and students in 
nature-study and old ladies with spy-glasses'll come down 
here to find it. And if they do, I 'm blest if I don't send 
them over to Lovell's and tell them he 's a distinguished 
author and wants to be interviewed. Blest if I don't ! " 

He walked off muttering maledictions, but with a face as 
sunny as the day, and Celia, looking after him, thought he 
was very handsome but his manners were most unrefined. She 
went slowly in, musingon Lovell now, her pretty brows knitted. 

"Where 's my sister, Lyddy ? " she asked in the kitchen. 

Lyddy was taking her afternoon rest by the window in 
the sun. 

" Up in the shed-chamber," she wakened to answer briefly, 
and Celia turned back and climbed the old rough stairs. 

The door was open and she paused there to look at Bess, 
seated by a cobwebby south window, and asleep. She had on 
her print morning dress, and her sleeves, rolled up a little, left 
her white wrists free. She had thrown her head back in the 
chair, and Celia, regarding the beautiful outline of it and the 
serious, sweet look of her flushed face, thought she seemed 
more a young mother than a girl. Her eyes came open sud- 
denly and met her sister's. 

" What is it ? " she asked quietly, without stirring. Celia 
went in and sat down on a stool at her feet. 

" What makes you stay up here ? " she asked. 

" I don't know," said Bess. She glanced about her, as if 
to seek some sufiicient reason. "It's kind of away from 
everything. It smells good, too, — herbs and old things." 



 





Celiahad a moment of considering whether Lovellwastoo 
young a man to be expected to do anything for Bess. If he 
had been an old man, it would be simple. After all, it was 
really only borrowing money on the security of a voice. 
Perhaps, even with a young man, it was simple. At least 
nothing would be lost if he liked her, and nothing was more 
likely than that he should, for he was half hermit in his tastes, 
and here was Bess making the shed-chamber her retreat. 

" Mr. Lovell has just called," she said. 

" Has he ? " asked Bess, with no appearance of interest 

"He looked very handsome." 

But this Bess did not answer, and Celia, looking up at 
her, saw that she was frowningly, yet with delicacy, extract- 
ing a fly from a cobweb on the pane. Rescues seemed to go 
in pairs that day. 

" Do you think he 's handsome, Bess? " insisted Celia. 

" Handsome ? " echoed Bess. She had unwound the last 
filament from the fettered gauze and now set the prisoner 
free outside the window. " I guess so. It don't make so 
much difference about men-folks anyway. If they 're strong 
and well, that 's enough." 

Celia looked at her a moment and then burst out laugh- 
ing. This was a real laugh, not her tinkling accompaniment. 

" I should think you were Lyddy," she cried, " O you 
darling thing ! " 



 



XV 

IT was not many days after this that Bess, sweeping ofF 
the front steps to save Lyddy's old bones, saw a little 
figure full of haste, yet dignity, advancing up the path. 
It was Tonty, clad in blue checked gingham and anxiety, no 
hat on her smoothly braided brown hair, and a little willow 
switch in her hand. That Tonty always carried when she 
walked abroad, because she was afraid of Tom Peasley's 
turkey-gobbler. She stopped a couple of feet short of the 
flight of steps, and regarded Bess with some surprise and 
much pleasure, evidently having expected to encounter 
Lyddy. 

"Is Jackie at home ? " she asked. 

She had heard Winterbourne's name, but chiefly from 
her mother's lips and those of persons inclined to stiffiiess 
and willingness to be grown up, and she made no doubt 
that Jackie was his own best name. 

" Who, little dear ? " Bess answered, with a desire to get 
her arms about the womanly figure. 

" Is Jackie at home ? " 

Winterbourne himself now came round the corner, smok- 
ing his morning pipe and picking his way on the flagstones 
bordered by the newly springing grass. 

" Well, my buttons ! " said he. " If here isn't the lady 
of the manor and the Maid of the Mist! I do feel honored, 
mum." 

He took out his pipe and knuckled his forehead in good 
old English style. But Tonty found no awakening laughter. 
Her face broke up into relief and happiness and misery. 



 





and when he reached her on the walk, she set upon him 
and clung. 

" O Jackie," she choked, " Tony 's awful sick." 
" Tony sick ? " he asked her gravely. " Where 's mother ? " 
" Mother 's gone to Cleveland. Is it far ? " 
" Pretty far," Winterbourne replied grimly. " But Hades 
is n't," he added, with an afterthought of Mrs. Ramsay 
and her disordered house. " Never you mind, ladykin. 
I'll get my hat, and we'll see what 's the matter with old 
Tony." 

" Shan't I go with you ? " Bess was asking. 
She had set her broom inside the hall closet, and given 
her sleeves a downward smooth, to make them ready for the 
street. Her eyes were warmly questioning. Winterbourne 
knew through the certainty of his natural understanding of 
her that she was on fire to get into a house where there 
were dirt and children. 

" Come along," he said. And when he had got his hat 
and Bess had slipped a bottle into her pocket, he took 
Tonty's hand and they walked off down the street, Bess 
following. 

Tonty had looked doubtfully and somewhat jealously on 
the prospect of a third on their quest, but Bess having the 
insight to fall behind, her presence was not really chal- 
lenged. It came out now, in the course of judicious ques- 
tioning, that Tony had been coughing for several days, but 
to-day he lay on the sofa and said he couldn't get up, and 
bade them bring him plum-cake. And Mary, the cook, had 
been sick upstairs, and Tonty felt he ought to be denied 
plum-cake, but there was no one to ask. Besides there was 
no plum-cake to give him. Then they were at the slipshod 
old house, and Tonty, scrupulously standing aside to let 
the strange lady enter, and vaguely conscious of the confu- 



 





sion to salute her, wished, in her little anxious soul, she had 
taken care of Tony herself. 

" Here we are," said Winterbourne. "This is our room." 

He threw open the nursery door, and Bess went in. 
Tony was lying on the sofa, his small person flanked by 
offerings from the nursery store. Tin soldiers were there, a 
set of clothespins Winterbourne had painted for Tonty long 
ago, and helped her dress in petticoats, and the tops of the 
establishment, three mangled and one in health, were wait- 
ing for the master hand to spin them. Tiny and Teeny sat 
in little chairs in the exact middle of the room, having been 
put there by Tonty at her departure, lest they should either 
take fire at the coals or come too near Tony's delirious 
grasp. Tony himself was red in the face, really, Tonty 
knew, from roaring for each particular thing he wanted and 
exacted as the tribute of one nigh unto his end. He cocked 
one eye at Winterbourne, and then closed it. He was not 
altogether pleased at the advent of grown-ups. Tony had 
counted on a superior day. 

Bess went forward to him in a silent haste. She knelt on 
the floor, and looked at him, felt his hands and his skin, 
and held one of his solid wrists in hers. 

" What is it, boy ? " she asked. 

Tony opened both eyes a slit and seemed to investigate 
her motives. But he closed them tight again, and groaned 
distressingly. Winterbourne was frowning with anxiety. 

" What do you think, Bess?" he inquired. "Think I 'd 
better call Pelham?"
