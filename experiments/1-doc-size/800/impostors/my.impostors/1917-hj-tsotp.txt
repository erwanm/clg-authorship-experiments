auditor that keeping it up was almost a strain. 
Quite for himself, however, nothing was easier. 
"He's magnificent. He's really beautiful." That 
indeed made him catch himself, and this time he 
turned away. "What I mean is he was\" 

"Before he ceased to be ?" 

"He hadn't or he hasn't," Ralph returned, 
"ceased to be; for if that were the case I myself 
shouldn't be here before you in the solid sound 
ness I've undertaken to impress you with. He 
was in a perfect prime that it was a joy, as a 
fellow-countryman, to behold. It was in that 
form that he again, for an hour, existed to me." 





  

"For an hour?" the Ambassador asked as if 
to be exact. 

"It was probably less even for all that passed 
between us; but the fact of my situation is that 
he did exist." 

"Is the fact of your situation that you've seen 
a ghost?" 

"Oh," Ralph raised his head high to say, "I 
decline to admit for a moment that he was that. 
He was much better than any ghost." 

It seemed to make for the Ambassador a dis 
tinction that he desired to grasp. " Better   ?" 

"Well, much more contrary to nature." 

"I don't understand then," the Ambassador 
said, "why you don't rather call it worse. Isn't 
the impression strange in proportion as it's con 
trary to nature, and isn't it by the same token 
agitating or upsetting or appalling, for any rela 
tion with such a matter, in proportion as it's 
strange?" After which he went on while Ralph 
felt his considering look: "Do you really like such 
impressions ?" 

"I see I'm an impression to you and of course 
an extraordinary one; but he wasn't one to me," 
Ralph pursued, "in any such sense as that for 
the interest of our relation, as you justly term it, 
is so much more interesting, you see, than any 
with which, even at the best, I can hope to in 
spire you. He was a man as substantial for me 
as I am or as I was I" Ralph pulled up a mo- 





  

ment to smile "for myself; and interesting most 
of all, I suppose, because so extraordinarily in 
terested." 

"Interested in yow?" his host inquired as with 
the care to avoid alike too much or too little 
gravity. 

"Well, yes interested in me by his being so 
possessed of the kind of thing that interests us 
both. I've been ridden all my life, I think I 
should tell you" for our young man thought it 
but fair to develop this "by the desire to culti 
vate some better sense of the past than has mostly 
seemed sufficient even for those people who have 
gone in most for cultivating it, and who with 
most complacency," Ralph permitted himself to 
add, "have put forth their results. So you can 
fancy what a charm it was," he wound up, "to 
catch a person, and a beautifully intelligent one, 
in the very act of cultivating 

The Ambassador was on his feet at this, with 
an effect of interruption, as by the very quickness 
of his apprehension. "His sense of the present !" 
he triumphantly smiled. 

But his visitor's smile reduced that felicity. 
"His sense of the future, don't you see? which 
had at last declined to let him rest, just as my 
corresponding expression had declined to let me. 
Only after his being worried," Ralph's scruple 
explained, "nearly a century longer." 

"A century's a long time to be worried!" the 




  

Ambassador remarked through his smoke, but 
permitting himself this time a confession of amuse 
ment. 

"Oh a terrible time of course but all leading 
up, you see, to this tremendous relief I've brought 
him. I've brought him, I've given him, I've 
introduced him to, the Future. So there we 
are!" Ralph gloried. 

His companion, though visibly impressed, ap 
peared a little to wonder where indeed they were. 
Then this wonder found voice. "How could you 
bring him what you didn't have yourself?" 

Ralph needed but a moment to consider. 
"Why, I am the Future. The Future, that is, 
for him; which means the Present, don't you 
see ?" 

"The Present, I see, for me I'   his host, fairly 
flushed with divination, broke in. 

"Yes," Ralph promptly returned, "nothing 

could do more beautifully than your Present, not to 

say, literally, your presence, for the Future he has 

waited so long, poor dear chap, to know about." 

"What it comes to then," the Ambassador 
considered in all apparent sympathy "what it 
comes to in fine," this functionary smoked, "is 
that I and my contemporaries are his Future." 

Ralph accepted the conclusion. "It would 
come to that if he could get into relation with 
you." 

It might have been by reason of something 




  

conveyed in his visitor's tone that the Ambassa 
dor said: "With me in particular you mean ?" 

Ralph met it handsomely. "Ah I could wish 
nothing better for him than you !" 

"And nothing better for me than him?" 

Ralph kept his eyes kindly on his country's 
representative. "Yes, since I find you so re 
markably good for myself." 

The Ambassador acknowledged the tribute, yet 
couldn't but formulate after all a certain inward 
confusion. "I'm only puzzled by your not hav 
ing spoken to me of your friend and yourself a 
moment ago as separate persons but on the con 
trary of your having arrived, wasn't it ? at some 
common identity or wonderful unity. You are 
the_Qther fellow, you said, didn't you ? and the 
other fellow, by the same stroke, is you. So that 
when I wonder where the other fellow is," he 
genially pursued, "it would seem that I've only 
to suppose him here in this room with me, in your 
interesting person." 

These words might have struck us as insidious 
enough just to trip up our young man, but his 
lucidity was in fact perfectly proof. "I didn't 
say, kindly understand, that we have merged per 
sonalities, but that we have definitely exchanged 
them which is a different matter. Our duality 
is so far from diminished that it's only the greater 
by our formulation, each to the other, of the 
so marked difference in our interest. The man 



  

ridden by his curiosity about the Past can't, you'll 
grasp, be one and the same with the man rid 
den by his curiosity about the Future. He has 
given me his chance for this, while I have given 
him mine for that. Recognise accordingly," said 
Ralph, "that we're at the opposite poles or at 
least in quite different place.8." 

It was wonderful more and more what the 
Ambassador could recognise by the aid of his kind 
wise little intervals of thought and indulgences 
of contemplation. "Yes, yes but if I of course 
see that you, as the distinct individual you are 
so fortunately able to claim to be, stand here de 
lightfully before me, that doesn't in the least tell 
me where he is located, as we say, in time and 
space." 

"Why, he's down at the door in the cab," 
Ralph returned with splendid simplicity. 

His host might have been lost for a moment 
in the sheer radiance of it even to the point in 
deed of a gesture guarding against excess of im 
pression or for that matter just gaining time. 
" Do you mean to say you're all this while keeping 
your hansom ?" 

"It's not a hansom in this eternal rain: it's 
a four-wheeler with the glasses up. And he only 
wants," our young man explained, "to wait as 
long as I require. So at least I understand," he 
remarked as an afterthought. 

"So that you'll find him in his rather tried 




  

patience, it strikes me when you go down ? 
And I should have the pleasure of seeing him 
too," the Ambassador further ventured, "if I 
were to go down with you ? " 

This truly was the first of his Excellency's ques 
tions to induce in our friend a pause at all omi 
nous. "Surely if he has not, under the strain 
of my absence, as you suggest, gone off on his 
own account." 

The Ambassador faced this contingency. 
"Where in that case will he have gone ?" 

"Why, as I've explained, into the Future. 
Say," Ralph threw off, "into Regent Street or 
Piccadilly." And then as his companion, at this, 
frankly laughed out: "They didn't exist, you see, 
at that time in any such form as they have to 
day." 

"I see, I see" his Excellency again was pre 
pared. "But fancy them," he clearly couldn't 
help at the same time exclaiming, "fancy them 
the reward for him of so sublime a self-projec 
tion!" 

"Well," Ralph readily reasoned, "my idea is 
that, with all they represent for him, they're not 
unlikely to prove as great a reward as any this 
extravagance of my own may come in for." 

"It's wonderful for me," the Ambassador soon 
replied, "by which I mean it's quite out of my 
common routine, to allow myself as you see I 
do! such intimate strange participations. I understand 
you that I'm to regard myself as mixed 
in the concern of your friend down there no less 
than in your own." 

Ralph considered of that, but with all equa 
nimity and to the upshot of his saying very natu 
rally: "You want to be sure, properly enough, of 
what you may at the worst be let in for; you 
want to be guaranteed against undue inconve 
nience. Well, I don't think I see you let in for 
anything worse than having thus heard me out 
and taken my name and address." With which 
our young man smiled. "May they lie light on 
your conscience!" 

"They will lie there, I assure you, in a place 
quite of their own" and the Ambassador took 
up the card brought in to him on his visitor's 
arrival and left close at hand. "This shall be 
carefully preserved, and I shall cherish, for the 
interest you inspire me with, the good hope of 
our some time meeting again." 

Ralph didn't discourage this hope, though what 
ever support he offered it was but to be inferred 
from what was left for recognition of such con 
nections in his more and more preoccupied face. 
That countenance, charged for a moment with 
further fair acknowledgments, seemed to turn 
away from them, before they were uttered, in the 
interest of something more urgent. "Of course I 
perfectly understand that you think me, that you 
must think me, more or less raving mad. I perfectly 
understand that you must want to keep 
me in view and be able as far as possible to track 
me and give some account of me in case of future 
inquiry. I appreciate that, and it was even ex 
actlyor it, I think, that I came. I really believe 
I ought to be tracked, to be subject to identifica- ' 
tion, to have an eye kept on me. I'm like one 
starting a perhaps perilous journey and wanting 
not to, have neglected precautions in advance. I 
don't in the least mind your thinking me mad 
I should be so, or should be at least idiotic, not 
to conceive my making the impression. At the 
same time I strike myself as of a sanity I've 
never enjoyed before. Don't be afraid of offend 
ing me, for what is it but your very protection 
against myself that I've thus invoked ? Not that 
I fear I shall destroy myself at least in any com 
mon way; I'm so far from intending or wishing 
to commit suicide that I'm proposing to push my 
affair all the way it will go, or in other words to 
live with an intensity unprecedented." 

"Well, if you live with the intensity to which 
you help others I don't see what responsibility 
you're likely to be accused of shirking. 7 can't 
keep still," the Ambassador then flatly declared, 
"till I've been down with you to verify that ques 
tion of your friend in the cab." 

Ralph offered so little objection to this his 
looking for a moment intensely grave about it 
amounting to no real objection that they had 
within a couple of minutes more descended to 
gether to the hall; where the servant in waiting, 
Ralph was afterwards to reflect, must at once 
have attested his conviction that his master was 
not simply seeing to the door a visitor of no in 
scribed importance. His Excellency would there 
fore be going further under some exceptional 
stress; and to this end would have been placed 
without delay in possession of his hat, gloves and 
stick; equipped with which objects it verily was 
that the Ambassador presently stood with his 
guest on the outer pavement and in presence of 
the waiting vehicle, any further domestic attend 
ance repressed and the door of the house closed 
behind them. There they remained a little, it 
may be mentioned long enough at least for the 
exchange of a smile now rather strained on either 
side, strained even to breaking, possibly, before 
Ralph could decide to approach his cab near 
enough for an effective view of its inner state. 
He had before this checked the motion of the 
roused driver, dozing on the box, toward a heavy 
officious descent, and then had himself faced the 
consequences of another step and a sufficient 
thrust of his head through the window of his 
"growler" to assure himself of the degree of dis 
simulation under which a conceivable companion 
might lurk there. His renewed look at the Am 
bassador after this was a confession that nothing 
lurked, though without its being at all a confession
of consequent defeat; so that, himself open 
ing the door and inviting his distinguished friend 
to pass in, he signalled a perfect readiness to ex 
plain disappointment away. The Ambassador, it 
must be added, allowed him at once and ever so 
considerately the largest license of apology for 
the production of a groundless hope; the great 
man's words in fact represented a glance at 
grounds that had lived their little hour. 

"His failure of patience through my having 
kept you so long you did, I recognise, mention 
the possibility of that," was his Excellency's 
noble remark. 

There came to Ralph's assistance on this a 
suddenly enlarged interest of vision; he had in 
deed within the house given utterance to that 
precautionary thought, but it was for all the 
world as if the same idea on the lips of his friend 
suggested something to go on with beyond even 
what his own intelligence had found. That was 
it ! nothing in the least discredited the report 
he had been occupied in making. That other 
party to the drive ending at the Embassy door 
was, with the most conceivable congruity, and 
thanks to a passion of curiosity that nothing could 
longer bridle, off on his own irresistible adventure: 
one had asked too much of him, at the point 
reached by their relation, in expecting so to choke 
off his own criticism. The interview upstairs had 
drawn itself out, and what had he had to do 
meanwhile, poor dear creature, but count the 
minutes that would lead to the striking of his 
hour? That the hour would strike for each of 
them as soon as the wise step now achieved had 
been taken this had been their assumption on 
settling together that afternoon, so much more 
for the accommodation, when all was said, Ralph 
could see now, of the victim of the sense of the 
Past than for that of the victim of the sense of 
the Future. The latter, it came to our friend, 
taking no precaution and making no provision, 
i none at least that one could one's self know any 
thing about, brought the business a more hurry 
ing passion: as would be perhaps of the very es 
sence for a man so concerned as compared with 
a man concerned as he himself was. He was 
conscious of ten rather bedimmed seconds during 
which he had positively to see the appeal he had 
obeyed as a thing in itself inferior to the motive 
under the force of which his late companion, no 
longer able merely to oblige him, had doubtless 
begun to beat fine wings and test brave lungs in 
the fresh air of his experiment. He had the real 
start, so to speak, while the subject of the Am 
bassador's interest had doubtless only the ad 
vantage that might, on some contingency as yet 
of the vaguest, reside in that. 

There thus breathed on our young man a mo 
mentary chill which, however, didn't prevent the 
Ambassador's seating himself without further delay,
nor his own perhaps slightly more contracted 
occupation of the second seat, nor their presently 
effective, their in fact rather confessedly contem 
plative, start for Mansfield Square. It was to 
appear to Ralph later on, at any rate, that they 
had at this stage been reduced to unembarrassed 
contemplation; which is perhaps indeed but a 
proof that while he gazed out of the cab window 
during this extraordinary progress what he looked 
at so fixedly as to take note of no interval of 
speech was neither the exhibition of successive . 
streets, with their aspects and their varieties of 
identity, but the portentous truth of his being 
launched, since, so conclusively, his counterpart 
in the circumstance was, and of his fate's having 
thereby shut down on any backward step. Not 
that he wanted to take one, not that he wanted 

to take one he kept repeating that as the 

vehicle rolled; to be as "in" for whatever awaited 
him as he now felt, as he now absolutely knew, 
himself, was a strong simplification with which 
wasn't it positively a blest one too ? which ques 
tion had not been answered in the negative, at 
any rate, even by the time they pulled up at the 
address he had given. This was what had taken 
place during their transit, he afterwards knew; 
the minutes had been so wholly given, in their 
course, to his inwardly sealing the charter of 
accommodation, as he would have called it, to 
whatever might now confront him that after he 

"3 






  

had got out, on the stoppage of the cab, he ad 
dressed to his companion a "Will you keep it 
on ? " which left things taken for granted between 
them without a scrap of a loose end dangling. 
He at least suffered none such, though there might 
have been just the sign of a difference in his good 
friend's face while the latter stepped straight out 
by way of answer. "Oh my dear man, I'll walk," 
he seemed to be saying; "I don't in the least mind 
your knowing that you've given me the fidgets 
or that I shall extremely need to think you over: 
which indulgence the use of my legs will healthily 
stimulate." 

Something of that sort Ralph was much later 
v on, as I say, to recover the appearance of his hav 
ing found words for; just as he was to piece to 
gether the presumption that, the cabman paid, 
magnificently paid, and getting again into mo 
tion, he and his protector for hadn't they after 
all rather exquisitely agreed to leave it at this ? 
stood face to face a little, under the prolongation 
of a hand-clasp; followed then by the mutual re 
lease that left his Excellency standing there on 
the pavement with the graver face of the two, he 
at least little doubted. Our young man was after 
that aware of a position of such eminence on the 
upper doorstep as made him, his fine rat-tat-tat- 
ah of the knocker achieved, see the whole world, 
the waiting, the wondering, the shrunkenly star 
ing representative of his country included, far, 





  

far, in fact at last quite abysmally below him. 
Whether these had been rapid or rather retarded 
stages he was really never to make out. Every 
thing had come to him through an increasingly 
thick other medium; the medium to which the 
opening door of the house gave at once an exten 
sion that was like an extraordinarily strong odour 
inhaled an inward and inward warm reach that 
his bewildered judge would literally have seen 
swallow him up; though perhaps with the supreme 
pause of the determined diver about to plunge 
just marked in him before the closing of the door 
again placed him on the right side and the whole 
world as he had known it on the wrong. 



BOOK FOURTH 

I 

HE was so far prepared as that, on the footman's 
saying, after he had asked who was at home, "I 
think Miss Midmore is, sir," he had not been un 
duly agitated; though the effect was of making 
him at the same time wonder if he oughtn't, more 
decently, to have had his approach heralded in 
the course of the morning by the bearer of a note. 
Such questions as these, from the arrival of his 
ship at Plymouth, had repeatedly come up for 
him, and he had not lacked leisure, since the eve 
ning before, when the west country mail had set 
him down in Piccadilly amid a great bustle of 
general recognition, to advise his cousins of his 
immediate intention to wait on them. The sense 
had grown within him during the last three days 
that mistakes of one sort and another would easily 
be open to a young man just alighted from New 
York; he had made several already between Dev 
onshire and London, even if without paying for 
them in heavier coin than a handful of new ob 
servations. His observations multiplied at such 
a rate that fifty to the minute would have been a 
short account of them; but there was one in par- 





  

ticular that had from the first kept repeating 
itself and that might certainly have done as much 
to point his address as some of the others had 
done to remind him of danger. The danger was 
flagrant and consisted of the number of things to 
be known and reckoned with in England as com 
pared to the few that had so sufficiently served 
him at home. He but wanted to know, though 
he would rather have liked to learn secretly; which 
for that matter he was now, he conceived, catch 
ing a little the trick of and this in spite of his 
wonted way, from far back, on receipt of a new 
impression or apprehension of a new fact, and 
under correction, in particular, of a wrong prem 
ise; which was to lose himself quite candidly 
and flagrantly in the world of meaning so con 
veyed. That disclosed quantity was apt fairly 
to make him stand still for wonder whereby it 
might well have happened that whosoever took 
note of him would scarce have known whether to 
conclude most on, his simplicity or on his wit. If it 
was strange to have had so to wait for familiar ap 
pearances familiar, that is, all round him, seem 
ingly, to everyone but himself it was perhaps 
more remarkable yet not to succeed in concealing 
how much one was on the spot ready to make of 
them by the working of some inward machinery. 
The great reassurance just mentioned at any 
rate, and which ministered still more to surprise 
than to confidence, came from his somehow mak- 





  

ing out that Ralph Pendrel enjoyed an advantage 
beyond any he missed; had a manner, a look or 
a tone, some natural brightness, some undesigned 
but conciliatory art, which perceptibly paved his 
way and which perhaps, should he incline to pre 
sume upon it, might really gain him favour. This 
inference he had had, and without gross vanity, 
time to make though arriving doubtless for the 
moment at no finer conclusion on it than that his 
spirits were all the while, beneath however small 
a bent to swagger or bluster, undiscourageably 
high, and that youth and good proportions, a 
clear face, a free hand and a brave errand, all 
borne on that tide, were capable of casting a 
spell of a sort that he should find occasion either 
to measure or to press. It had been odd assur 
edly to come thus soon to a thought of spells 
especially in the midst of a consciousness of blun 
ders; but it possibly reinforced a little even this 
degree of presumption that the very blunders, 
which might have been all to his confusion save 
that various other persons had promptly and 
obligingly, as it were, taken them over, appeared 
grandly imputable to the same spring of fresh 
ness. He couldn't deny to himself his eagerness 
extraordinarily strong and which people made 
way for, to the extent even of a large margin, as 
if they liked to see it and to wait for what it 
might further show. It was an eagerness cer 
tainly to enjoy, yet not at anyone's cost, any- 





  

one's in particular; and this might to those deal 
ing with him have seemed rare, or in other words 
have seemed charming, the sticking out of an 
impulse not as a pike on a charge but after the 
fashion of a beggar's hat presented for the receipt 
of alms. That was the figure, that the case 
the pennies had hour after hour veritably rained 
in; and what but a perfect rattle of them, by that 
token, accompanied him at the footman's heels 
upstairs to where it could only be that Molly 
Midmore awaited though perhaps but just in 
a general way his presenting himself as a suitor 
for her hand ? 

He had been touched in the hall and on the 
staircase as by the faint odd brush of a sugges 
tion that what was before his eyes during certain 
seconds had already been before them and was 
playing upon his attention, was quite seeking to, 
even though in the lightest, softest tug at it, by 
the recall of a similar case or similar conditions. 
Just so when the door above was opened to him 
and he heard himself announced the first flush of 
his impression was that of stepping straight into 
some chapter of some other story other than his 
own of that moment, since he was by the evidence 
of every felt pulse up to his eyes in a situation, 
which glimmered upon him in the light, the bright 
strong light, of an aspect recognised; before 
failing of that effect indeed under his next full 
rush of perception. Wasn't it a place known, 





  

the great square wainscotted room, like several 
perhaps in which he had seen a sort of life led 
at home, only fairer and finer than those; with 
handsome objects and four or five portraits rather 
largely interspaced, and a daylight freshness in 
possession, the air at once of an outer clearness, 
of an emptier world looking in, and of windows 
unembarrassed to match, multiplied panes, one 
would say, but withal a prim spare drapery ? It 
wouldn't have been that the world was emptier 
than he had known it beyond the sea, but that 
the scene itself, as it appeared for the ten seconds 
that challenged memory and comparison, would 
have worn its other face with a difference, con 
fessing somehow to thicker shadows and heavier 
presences, the submission to a longer assault. 
Such matter of record, even on the part of a 
young man of the highest sensibility, is at the 
best elusive enough, however, and Ralph's gen 
eral awareness was at once swallowed up in the 
particular positive certainty that nobody in all 
his experience in the least answered to the young 
lady seated near one of the windows before a 
piece of fine tense canvas framed and mounted 
on slim wooden legs, through which she was in 
the act of drawing a long filament of silk with 
the finest arm in the world raised as high as her 
head. He himself so far answered to something 
in her own intelligence .that at sight and sound 
of him she slowly got up from before her work, 
with never a hint of interruption or confusion, 
and smiled across at him as if knowing all about 
him. She kept in this movement her arm still 
aloft she might have been just balancing her 
self or wishing not to loosen her stitch; he was 
to remember afterwards how the crook of her 
little finger, in the raised hand, caught his eye 
at the distance, and how this helped him in a 
manner at once to take in that the arm itself, its 
sleeve shortened to very near the shoulder, was 
of the most beautiful rounded shape. That light 
of her knowing all about him doubtless helped 
to flood his own mind with the assurance imme 
diately needed: he felt at this stage, in the most 
wonderful way, that things came to him, every 
thing a right carriage required for the closer per 
sonal relation, in the very nick of being wanted, 
and wore thus, even under the gasp of a slight 
danger escaped, a certain charm and cheer of 
suddenness. That he was to make love, by every 
propriety, to Molly Midmore, and that he had 
in fact reached his goal on the very wings of that 
intention, this foretaste as of something rare had 
for days and days past hung about him like the 
scent of a flower persisting in life; but the sweet 
ness of his going straight up to her with an offered 
embrace hadn't really been disclosed till her re 
cognition, as we have said, breathed upon it with 
force and filled him at once with an extraordinary 
wealth of confidence. 





  

He had stepped straight into that with his 
stepping into the room, and while he stood but 
long enough to know himself lifted and carried 
the taking in of what she was through all his 
senses completed the splendid Tightness. Nothing 
might have been stranger than so repeated a 
jump, so flying a leap, to firm ground which 
hadn't been there before in any measurable 
manner but which his feet just felt beneath them 
at the crisis of need. Was it going to be enough 
simply to do the thing, whatever it might be, for 
it to "come" right, as they said, and for him 
above all to like it, as who should also say, after 
the fact ? Surprising perhaps that questions of 
so comparatively general a kind should press 
with their air of particular business into an active 
apprehension unconditioned and absolute enough 
to forestall any conceivable lapse; yet nothing 
could well be pleasanter than such a quickening, 
and this even under the possibility that he might 
after a little get used to it. The young woman 
there in her capacious corner was admirably, 
radiantly handsome, and all the while still kept 
the posture she had at once risen to kept it as 
for fear of his loss of the pleasure by her breaking 
it ever so little. The case was of course really 
that a mere moment sufficed for these enormities 
of attestation; the air roundabout them was 
prodigiously clean and clear, and so favoured 
happy certitude that by the time he had advanced 





  

a trifle further he was, in addition to everything 
else we have indicated, aware that, modest as 
she would indubitably prove, she was neither 
awkward nor shy, and was in fact quite as in
