  The law itself not unfrequently performs the most cruel separations
  of families, almost without the intervention of individual agency.
  This happens in the case of persons who die insolvent, or who become
  so during lifetime. The estate, real and personal, must be disposed
  of at auction to the highest bidder, and the executor,
  administrator, sheriff, trustee, or other person whose duty it is to
  dispose of the property, although he may possess the most humane
  intentions in the world, cannot prevent the final severance of the
  most endearing ties of kindred. The illustration given by Mrs.
  Stowe, in the sale of Uncle Tom by Mr. Shelby, is a very common
  case. Pecuniary embarrassment is a most fruitful source of
  misfortune to the slave as well as the master; and instances of
  family ties broken from this cause are of daily occurrence.

  It often happens that great abuses exist in violation of law, and in
  spite of the efforts of the authorities to suppress them; such is
  the case with drunkenness, gambling, and other vices. But here is a
  law common to all the slave-holding states, which upholds and gives
  countenance to the wrong-doer, while its blackest terrors are
  reserved for those who would interpose to protect the innocent.
  Statesmen of elevated and honorable characters, from a vague notion
  of state necessity, have defended this law in the abstract, while
  they would, without hesitation, condemn every instance of its
  application as unjust.

  In one respect I am glad to see it publicly denied that the families
  of slaves are separated; for while it argues a disreputable want of
  candor, it at the same time evinces a commendable sense of shame,
  and induces the hope that the public opinion at the South will not
  much longer tolerate this most odious, though not essential, part of
  the system of slavery.

  In this connection I will call to your recollection a remark of the
  editor of the Southern Press, in one of the last numbers of that
  paper, which acknowledges the existence of the abuse in question,
  and recommends its correction. He says:

  “The South has a great moral conflict to wage; and it is for her to
  put on the most invulnerable moral panoply. Hence it is her duty, as
  well as interest, to mitigate or remove whatever of evil that
  results incidentally from the institution. The separation of husband
  and wife, parent and child, is one of these evils, which we know is
  generally avoided and repudiated there—although cases sometimes
  occur which we observe are seized by these Northern fanatics as
  characteristic illustrations of the system. Now we can see no great
  evil or inconvenience, but much good, in the prohibition by law of
  such occurrences. Let the husband and wife be sold together, and the
  parents and minor children. Such a law would affect but slightly the
  general value or availability of slave property, and would prevent
  in some cases the violence done to the feelings of such connections
  by sales either compulsory or voluntary. We are satisfied that it
  would be beneficial to the master and slave to promote marriage, and
  the observance of all its duties and relations.”

  Much as I have differed with the editor of the Southern Press in
  his general views of public policy, I am disposed to forgive him
  past errors in consideration of his public acknowledgment of this
  “incidental evil,” and his frank recommendation of its removal. A
  Southern newspaper less devoted than the Southern Press to the
  maintenance of slavery would be seriously compromised by such a
  suggestion, and its advice would be far less likely to be heeded. I
  think, therefore, that Mr. Fisher deserves the thanks of every good
  man, North and South, for thus boldly pointing out the necessity of
  reform.

  The picture which Mrs. Stowe has drawn of slavery as an institution
  is anything but favorable. She has illustrated the frightful cruelty
  and oppression that must result from a law which gives to one class
  of society almost absolute and irresponsible power over another. Yet
  the very machinery she has employed for this purpose shows that all
  who are parties to the system are not necessarily culpable. It is a
  high virtue in St. Clare to purchase Uncle Tom. He is actuated by no
  selfish or improper motive. Moved by a desire to gratify his
  daughter, and prompted by his own humane feelings, he purchases a
  slave, in order to rescue him from a hard fate on the plantations.
  If he had not been a slave-holder before, it was now his duty to
  become one. This, I think, is the moral to be drawn from the story
  of St. Clare, and the South have a right to claim the authority of
  Mrs. Stowe in defence of slave-holding, to this extent.

  It may be said that it was the duty of St. Clare to emancipate Uncle
  Tom; but the wealth of the Rothschilds would not enable a man to act
  out his benevolent instincts at such a price. And if such was his
  duty, is it not equally the duty of every monied man in the free
  states to attend the New Orleans slave-mart with the same benevolent
  purpose in view? It seems to me that to purchase a slave with the
  purpose of saving him from a hard and cruel fate, and without any
  view to emancipation, is itself a good action. If the slave should
  subsequently become able to redeem himself, it would doubtless be
  the duty of the owner to emancipate him; and it would be but
  even-handed justice to set down every dollar of the slave’s
  earnings, above the expense of his maintenance, to his credit, until
  the price paid for him should be fully restored. This is all that
  justice could exact of the slave-holder.

  Those who have railed against “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” as an incendiary
  publication have singularly (supposing that they have read the book)
  overlooked the moral of the hero’s life. Uncle Tom is the most
  faithful of servants. He literally “obeyed in all things” his
  “masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as
  men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.” If his
  conduct exhibits the slightest departure from a literal fulfilment
  of this injunction of Scripture, it is in a case which must command
  the approbation of the most rigid casuist; for the injunction of
  obedience extends, of course, only to lawful commands. It is only
  when the monster Legree commands him to inflict undeserved
  chastisement upon his fellow-servants, that Uncle Tom refuses
  obedience. He would not listen to a proposition of escaping into
  Ohio with the young woman Eliza, on the night after they were sold
  by Mr. Shelby to the trader Haley. He thought it would be bad faith
  to his late master, whom he had nursed in his arms, and might be the
  means of bringing him into difficulty. He offered no resistance to
  Haley, and obeyed even Legree in every legitimate command. But when
  he was required to be the instrument of his master’s cruelty, he
  chose rather to die, with the courage and resolution of a Christian
  martyr, than to save his life by a guilty compliance. Such was Uncle
  Tom—not a bad example for the imitation of man or master.

                                         I am, sir, very respectfully,
                                             Your ob’t serv’t,
                                                 DANIEL R. GOODLOE.

The writer has received permission to publish the following extract from
a letter received by a lady at the North from the editor of a Southern
paper. The mind and character of the author will speak for themselves,
in the reading of it:

                                Charleston, Sunday, 25th July, 1852.

  * * * The books, I infer, are Mrs. Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s
  Cabin.” The book was furnished me by —— ——, about a fortnight ago,
  and you may be assured I read it with an attentive interest. “Now,
  what is your opinion of it?” you will ask; and, knowing my
  preconceived opinions upon the question of slavery, and the
  embodiment of my principles, which I have so long supported, in
  regard to that peculiar institution, you may be prepared to meet
  an indirect answer. This my own consciousness of truth would not
  allow, in the present instance. The book is a truthful picture of
  life, with the dark outlines beautifully portrayed. The life—the
  characteristics, incidents, and the dialogues—is life itself reduced
  to paper. In her appendix she rather evades the question whether it
  was taken from actual scones, but says there are many counterparts.
  In this she is correct, beyond doubt. Had she changed the picture of
  Legree, on Red river, for —— ——, on —— Island, South Carolina, she
  could not have drawn a more admirable portrait. I am led to question
  whether she had not some knowledge of this beast, as he is known to
  be, and made the transposition for effect.

  My position in connection with the extreme party, both in Georgia
  and South Carolina, would constitute a restraint to the full
  expression of my feelings upon several of the governing principles
  of the institution. I have studied slavery, in all its different
  phases,—have been thrown in contact with the negro in different
  parts of the world, and made it my aim to study his nature, so far
  as my limited abilities would give me light,—and, whatever my
  opinions have been, they were based upon what I supposed to be
  honest convictions.

  During the last three years you well know what my opportunities have
  been to examine all the sectional bearings of an institution which
  now holds the great and most momentous question of our federal
  well-being. These opportunities I have not let pass, but have given
  myself, body and soul, to a knowledge of its vast intricacies,—to
  its constitutional compact, and its individual hardships. Its wrongs
  are in the constituted rights of the master, and the blank letter
  of those laws which pretend to govern the bondman’s rights. What
  legislative act, based upon the construction of self-protection for
  the very men who contemplate the laws,—even though their intention
  was amelioration,—could be enforced, when the legislated object is
  held as the bond property of the legislator? The very fact of
  constituting a law for the amelioration of property becomes an
  absurdity, so far as carrying it out is concerned. A law which is
  intended to govern, and gives the governed no means of seeking its
  protection, is like the clustering together of so many useless words
  for vain show. But why talk of law? That which is considered the
  popular rights of a people, and every tenacious prejudice set forth
  to protect its property interest, creates its own power, against
  every weaker vessel. Laws which interfere with this become
  unpopular,—repugnant to a forceable will, and a dead letter in
  effect. So long as the voice of the governed cannot be heard, and
  his wrongs are felt beyond the jurisdiction or domain of the law, as
  nine-tenths are, where is the hope of redress? The master is the
  powerful vessel; the negro feels his dependence, and, fearing the
  consequences of an appeal for his rights, submits to the cruelty of
  his master, in preference to the dread of something more cruel. It
  is in those disputed cases of cruelty we find the wrongs of slavery,
  and in those governing laws which give power to bad Northern men to
  become the most cruel taskmasters. Do not judge, from my
  observations, that I am seeking consolation for the abolitionists.
  Such is not my intention; but truth to a course which calls loudly
  for reformation constrains me to say that humanity calls for some
  law to govern the force and absolute will of the master, and to
  reform no part is more requisite than that which regards the slave’s
  food and raiment. A person must live years at the South before he
  can become fully acquainted with the many workings of slavery. A
  Northern man not prominently interested in the political and social
  weal of the South may live for years in it, and pass from town to
  town in his every-day pursuits, and yet see but the polished side of
  slavery. With me it has been different. Its effect upon the negro
  himself, and its effect upon the social and commercial well-being of
  Southern society, has been laid broadly open to me, and I have seen
  more of its workings within the past year than was disclosed to me
  all the time before. It is with these feelings that I am constrained
  to do credit to Mrs. Stowe’s book, which I consider must have been
  written by one who derived the materials from a thorough
  acquaintance with the subject. The character of the slave-dealer,
  the bankrupt owner in Kentucky, and the New Orleans merchant, are
  simple every-day occurrences in these parts. Editors may speak of
  the dramatic effect as they please; the tale is not told them, and
  the occurrences of common reality would form a picture more glaring.
  I could write a work, with date and incontrovertible facts, of
  abuses which stand recorded in the knowledge of the community in
  which they were transacted, that would need no dramatic effect, and
  would stand out ten-fold more horrible than anything Mrs. Stowe has
  described.

  I have read two columns in the Southern Press of Mrs. Eastman’s
  “Aunt Phillis’ Cabin, or Southern Life as It Is,” with the remarks
  of the editor. I have no comments to make upon it, that being done
  by itself. The editor might have saved himself being writ down an
  ass by the public, if he had withheld his nonsense. If the two
  columns are a specimen of Mrs. Eastman’s book, I pity her attempt
  and her name as an author.




                                PART II.




                               CHAPTER I.


The New York Courier and Enquirer of November 5th contained an article
which has been quite valuable to the author, as summing up, in a clear,
concise and intelligible form, the principal objections which may be
urged to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. It is here quoted in full, as the
foundation of the remarks in the following pages.

The author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” that writer states, has committed
false-witness against thousands and millions of her fellow-men.

  She has done it [he says] by attaching to them as slaveholders, in
  the eyes of the world, the guilt of the abuses of an institution of
  which they are absolutely guiltless. Her story is so devised as to
  present slavery in three dark aspects: first, the cruel treatment
  of the slaves; second, the separation of families; and, third,
  their want of religious instruction.

  To show the first, she causes a reward to be offered for the
  recovery of a runaway slave, “dead or alive,” when no reward with
  such an alternative was ever heard of, or dreamed of, south of Mason
  and Dixon’s line, and it has been decided over and over again in
  Southern courts that “a slave who is merely flying away cannot be
  killed.” She puts such language as this into the mouth of one of her
  speakers:—“The master who goes furthest and does the worst only uses
  within limits the power that the law gives him;” when, in fact, the
  civil code of the very state where it is represented the language
  was uttered—Louisiana—declares that

  “The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master, who may
  correct and chastise him, though not with unusual rigor, nor so as
  to maim or mutilate him, or to expose him to the danger of loss of
  life, or to cause his death.”

  And provides for a compulsory sale

  “When the master shall be convicted of cruel treatment of his
  slaves, and the judge shall deem proper to pronounce, besides the
  penalty established for such cases, that the slave be sold at public
  auction, in order to place him out of the reach of the power which
  the master has abused.”

  “If any person whatsoever shall wilfully kill his slave, or the
  slave of another person, the said person, being convicted thereof,
  shall be tried and condemned agreeably to the laws.”

  In the General Court of Virginia, last year, in the case of Souther
  v. the Commonwealth, it was held that the killing of a slave by
  his master and owner, by wilful and excessive whipping, is murder in
  the first degree, though it may not have been the purpose of the
  master and owner to kill the slave! And it is not six months since
  Governor Johnston, of Virginia, pardoned a slave who killed his
  master, who was beating him with brutal severity.

  And yet, in the face of such laws and decisions as these, Mrs. Stowe
  winds up a long series of cruelties upon her other black personages,
  by causing her faultless hero, Tom, to be literally whipped to death
  in Louisiana, by his master, Legree; and these acts, which the laws
  make criminal, and punish as such, she sets forth in the most
  repulsive colors, to illustrate the institution of slavery!

  So, too, in reference to the separation of children from their
  parents. A considerable part of the plot is made to hinge upon the
  selling, in Louisiana, of the child Eliza, “eight or nine years
  old,” away from her mother; when, had its inventor looked in the
  statute-book of Louisiana, she would have found the following
  language:

  “Every person is expressly prohibited from selling separately from
  their mothers the children who shall not have attained the full age
  of ten years.”

  “Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons shall sell
  the mother of any slave child or children under the age of ten
  years, separate from said child or children, or shall, the mother
  living, sell any slave child or children of ten years of age, or
  under, separate from said mother, said person or persons shall be
  fined not less than one thousand nor more than two thousand dollars,
  and be imprisoned in the public jail for a period of not less than
  six months nor more than one year.”

  The privation of religious instruction, as represented by Mrs.
  Stowe, is utterly unfounded in fact. The largest churches in the
  Union consist entirely of slaves. The first African church in
  Louisville, which numbers fifteen hundred persons, and the first
  African church in Augusta, which numbers thirteen hundred, are
  specimens. On multitudes of the large plantations in the different
  parts of the South the ordinances of the gospel are as regularly
  maintained, by competent ministers, as in any other communities,
  north or south. A larger proportion of the slave population are in
  communion with some Christian church, than of the white population
  in any part of the country. A very considerable portion of every
  southern congregation, either in city or country, is sure to consist
  of blacks; whereas, of our northern churches, not a colored person
  is to be seen in one out of fifty.

  The peculiar falsity of this whole book consists in making
  exceptional or impossible cases the representatives of the system.
  By the same process which she has used, it would not be difficult to
  frame a fatal argument against the relation of husband and wife, or
  parent and child, or of guardian and ward; for thousands of wives
  and children and wards have been maltreated, and even murdered. It
  is wrong, unpardonably wrong, to impute to any relation of life
  those enormities which spring only out of the worst depravity of
  human nature. A ridiculously extravagant spirit of generalization
  pervades this fiction from beginning to end. The Uncle Tom of the
  authoress is a perfect angel, and her blacks generally are half
  angels; her Simon Legree is a perfect demon, and her whites
  generally are half demons. She has quite a peculiar spite against
  the clergy; and, of the many she introduces at different times into
  the scenes, all, save an insignificant exception, are Pharisees or
  hypocrites. One who could know nothing of the United States and its
  people, except by what he might gather from this book, would judge
  that it was some region just on the confines of the infernal world.
  We do not say that Mrs. Stowe was actuated by wrong motives in the
  preparation of this work, but we do say that she has done a wrong
  which no ignorance can excuse and no penance can expiate.

A much-valued correspondent of the author, writing from Richmond,
Virginia, also uses the following language:

  I will venture this morning to make a few suggestions which have
  occurred to me in regard to future editions of your work, “Uncle
  Tom’s Cabin,” which I desire should have all the influence of which
  your genius renders it capable, not only abroad, but in the local
  sphere of slavery, where it has been hitherto repudiated. Possessing
  already the great requisites of artistic beauty and of sympathetic
  affection, it may yet be improved in regard to accuracy of statement
  without being at all enfeebled. For example, you do less than
  justice to the formalized laws of the Southern States, while you
  give more credit than is due to the virtue of public or private
  sentiment in restricting the evil which the laws permit.

  I enclose the following extracts from a southern paper:

    “‘I’ll manage that ar; they’s young in the business, and must
    spect to work cheap,’ said Marks, as he continued to read.
    ‘Thar’s three on ‘em easy cases, ‘cause all you’ve got to do is
    to shoot ‘em, or swear they is shot; they couldn’t, of course,
    charge much for that.’”

  “The reader will observe that two charges against the South are
  involved in this precious discourse;—one that it is the habit of
  Southern masters to offer a reward, with the alternative of ‘dead or
  alive,’ for their fugitive slaves; and the other, that it is usual
  for pursuers to shoot them. Indeed, we are led to infer that, as the
  shooting is the easier mode of obtaining the reward, it is the more
  frequently employed in such cases. Now, when a Southern master
  offers a reward for his runaway slave, it is because he has lost a
  certain amount of property, represented by the negro which he wishes
  to recover. What man of Vermont, having an ox or an ass that had
  gone astray, would forthwith offer half the full value of the
  animal, not for the carcass, which might be turned to some useful
  purpose, but for the unavailing satisfaction of its head? Yet are
  the two cases exactly parallel? With regard to the assumption that
  men are permitted to go about, at the South, with double-barrelled
  guns, shooting down runaway negroes, in preference to apprehending
  them, we can only say that it is as wicked and wilful as it is
  ridiculous. Such Thugs there may have been as Marks and Loker, who
  have killed negroes in this unprovoked manner; but, if they have
  escaped the gallows, they are probably to be found within the walls
  of our state penitentiaries, where they are comfortably provided for
  at public expense. The laws of the Southern States, which are
  designed, as in all good governments, for the protection of persons
  and property, have not been so loosely framed as to fail of their
  object where person and property are one.

  “The law with regard to the killing of runaways is laid down with so
  much clearness and precision by a South Carolina judge, that we
  cannot forbear quoting his dictum, as directly in point. In the case
  of Witsell v. Earnest and Parker, Colcock J. delivered the opinion
  of the court:

[Sidenote: Jan. term, 1818 1 Nott & McCord’s S. C. Rep. 182.]

  “‘By the statute of 1740, any white man may apprehend, and
  moderately correct, any slave who may be found out of the plantation
  at which he is employed; and if the slave assaults the white person,
  he may be killed; but a slave who is merely flying away cannot be
  killed. Nor can the defendants be justified by the common law, if we
  consider the negro as a person; for they were not clothed with the
  authority of the law to apprehend him as a felon, and without such
  authority he could not be killed.’

    “‘It’s commonly supposed that the property interest is a
    sufficient guard in these cases. If people choose to ruin their
    possessions, I don’t know what’s to be done. It seems the poor
    creature was a thief and a drunkard; and so there won’t be much
    hope to get up sympathy for her.’

    “‘It is perfectly outrageous,—it is horrid, Augustine! It will
    certainly bring down vengeance upon you.’

    “‘My dear cousin, I didn’t do it, and I can’t help it; I would,
    if I could. If low-minded, brutal people will act like
    themselves, what am I to do? They have absolute control; they
    are irresponsible despots. There would be no use in
    interfering; there is no law, that amounts to anything
    practically, for such a case. The best we can do is to shut our
    eyes and ears, and let it alone. It’s the only resource left
    us.’

  “In a subsequent part of the same conversation, St. Clare says:

    “‘For pity’s sake, for shame’s sake, because we are men born of
    women, and not savage beasts, many of us do not, and dare
    not,—we would scorn to use the full power which our savage
    laws put into our hands. And he who goes furthest and does the
    worst only uses within limits the power that the law gives
    him.’

  “Mrs. Stowe tells us, through St. Clare, that ‘there is no law that
  amounts to anything’ in such cases, and that he who goes furthest in
  severity towards his slave,—that is, to the deprivation of an eye or
  a limb, or even the destruction of life,—‘only uses within limits
  the power that the law gives him.’ This is an awful and tremendous
  charge, which, lightly and unwarrantably made, must subject the
  maker to a fearful accountability. Let us see how the matter stands
  upon the statute-book of Louisiana. By referring to the civil code
  of that state, chapter 3d, article 173, the reader will find this
  general declaration:

  “‘The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master, who may
  correct and chastise him, though not with unusual rigor, nor so as
  to maim or mutilate him, or to expose him to the danger of loss of
  life, or to cause his death.’

  “On a subsequent page of the same volume and chapter, article 192,
  we find provision made for the slave’s protection against his
  master’s cruelty, in the statement that one of two cases, in which a
  master can be compelled to sell his slave, is

  “‘When the master shall be convicted of cruel treatment of his
  slave, and the judge shall deem proper to pronounce, besides the
  penalty established for such cases, that the slave shall be sold at
  public auction, in order to place him out of the reach of the power
  which the master has abused.’

  “A code thus watchful of the negro’s safety in life and limb
  confines not its guardianship to inhibitory clauses, but proscribes
  extreme penalties in case of their infraction. In the Code Noir
  (Black Code) of Louisiana, under head of Crimes and Offences, No.
  55, § xvi., it is laid down, that

  “‘If any person whatsoever shall wilfully kill his slave, or the
  slave of another person, the said person, being convicted thereof,
  shall be tried and condemned agreeably to the laws.’

  “And because negro testimony is inadmissible in the courts of the
  state, and therefore the evidence of such crimes might be with
  difficulty supplied, it is further provided that,

[Sidenote: Code Noir. Crimes and Offences, 56, xvii.]

  “‘If any slave be mutilated, beaten or ill-treated, contrary to the
  true intent and meaning of this act, when no one shall be present,
  in such case the owner, or other person having the management of
  said slave thus mutilated, shall be deemed responsible and guilty of
  the said offence, and shall be prosecuted without further evidence,
  unless the said owner, or other person so as aforesaid, can prove
  the contrary by means of good and sufficient evidence, or can clear
  himself by his own oath, which said oath every court, under the
  cognizance of which such offence shall have been examined and tried,
  is by this act authorized to administer.’

  “Enough has been quoted to establish the utter falsity of the
  statement, made by our authoress through St. Clare, that brutal
  masters are ‘irresponsible despots,’—at least in Louisiana. It would
  extend our review to a most unreasonable length, should we undertake
  to give the law, with regard to the murder of slaves, as it stands
  in each of the Southern States. The crime is a rare one, and
  therefore the reporters have had few cases to record. We may refer,
  however, to two. In Fields v. the State of Tennessee, the
  plaintiff in error was indicted in the circuit court of Maury county
  for the murder of a negro slave. He pleaded not guilty; and at the
  trial was found guilty of wilful and felonious slaying of the slave.
  From this sentence he prosecuted his writ of error, which was
  disallowed, the court affirming the original judgment. The opinion
  of the court, as given by Peck J., overflows with the spirit of
  enlightened humanity. He concludes thus:

[Sidenote: 1 Yerger’s Tenn. Rep. 156.]

  “‘It is well said by one of the judges of North Carolina, that the
  master has a right to exact the labor of his slave; that far, the
  rights of the slave are suspended; but this gives the master no
  right over the life of his slave. I add to the saying of the judge,
  that law which says thou shalt not kill, protects the slave; and he
  is within its very letter. Law, reason, Christianity, and common
  humanity, all point but one way.’

[Sidenote: 7 Grattan’s Rep. 673.]

  “In the General Court of Virginia, June term, 1851, in Souther v.
  the Commonwealth, it was held that ‘the killing of a slave by his
  master and owner, by wilful and excessive whipping, is murder in the
  first degree; though it may not have been the purpose of the master
  and owner to kill the slave.’ The writer shows, also, an ignorance
  of the law of contracts, as it affects slavery in the South, in
  making George’s master take him from the factory against the
  proprietor’s consent. George, by virtue of the contract of hiring,
  had become the property of the proprietor for the time being, and
  his master could no more have taken him away forcibly than the owner
  of a house in Massachusetts can dispossess his lessee, at any
  moment, from mere whim or caprice. There is no court in Kentucky
  where the hirer’s rights, in this regard, would not be enforced.

    “‘No. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New
    Orleans, and brought her up as a present to mother. She was
    about eight or nine years old, then. Father would never tell
    mother what he gave for her; but, the other day, in looking over
    his old papers, we came across the bill of sale. He paid an
    extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I suppose, on account of
    her extraordinary beauty.’

    “George sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed
    expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.

    “At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a
    face perfectly white with interest, said, ‘Do you know the names
    of the people he bought her of?’

    “‘A man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in
    the transaction. At least, I think that was the name in the bill
    of sale.’

    “‘O, my God!’ said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of
    the cabin.”

  “Of course Eliza turns out to be Cassy’s child, and we are soon
  entertained with the family meeting in Montreal, where George Harris
  is living, five or six years after the opening of the story, in
  great comfort.

  “Now, the reader will perhaps be surprised to know that such an
  incident as the sale of Cassy apart from Eliza, upon which the whole
  interest of the foregoing narrative hinges, never could have taken
  place in Louisiana, and that the bill of sale for Eliza would not
  have been worth the paper it was written on. Observe. George Shelby
  states that Eliza was eight or nine years old at the time his
  father purchased her in New Orleans. Let us again look at the
  statute-book of Louisiana.

  “In the Code Noir we find it set down that

  “‘Every person is expressly prohibited from selling separately from
  their mothers the children who shall not have attained the full age
  of ten years.’

  “And this humane provision is strengthened by a statute, one clause
  of which runs as follows:

  “‘Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons shall sell
  the mother of any slave child or children under the age of ten
  years, separate from said child or children, or shall, the mother
  living, sell any slave child or children of ten years of age, or
  under, separate from said mother, such person or persons shall
  incur the penalty of the sixth section of this act.’

  “This penalty is a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than
  two thousand dollars, and imprisonment in the public jail for a
  period of not less than six months nor more than one year.—Vide
  Acts of Louisiana, 1 Session, 9th Legislature, 1828, 1829, No. 24,
  Section 16.”

The author makes here a remark. Scattered through all the Southern
States are slaveholders who are such only in name. They have no pleasure
in the system, they consider it one of wrong altogether, and they hold
the legal relation still, only because not yet clear with regard to the
best way of changing it, so as to better the condition of those held.
Such are most earnest advocates for state emancipation, and are friends
of anything, written in a right spirit, which tends in that direction.
From such the author ever receives criticisms with pleasure.

She has endeavored to lay before the world, in the fullest manner, all
that can be objected to her work, that both sides may have an
opportunity of impartial hearing.

When writing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” though entirely unaware and
unexpectant of the importance which would be attached to its statements
and opinions, the author of that work was anxious, from love of
consistency, to have some understanding of the laws of the slave system.
She had on hand for reference, while writing, the Code Noir of
Louisiana, and a sketch of the laws relating to slavery in the different
states, by Judge Stroud, of Philadelphia. This work, professing to have
been compiled with great care from the latest editions of the
statute-books of the several states, the author supposed to be a
sufficient guide for the writing of a work of fiction.[3] As the
accuracy of those statements which relate to the slave-laws has been
particularly contested, a more especial inquiry has been made in this
direction. Under the guidance and with the assistance of legal gentlemen
of high standing, the writer has proceeded to examine the statements of
Judge Stroud with regard to statute-law, and to follow them up with some
inquiry into the decisions of courts. The result has been an increasing
conviction on her part that the impressions first derived from Judge
Stroud’s work were correct; and the author now can only give the words
of St. Clare, as the best possible expression of the sentiments and
opinion which this course of reading has awakened in her mind.

  This cursed business, accursed of God and man,—what is it? Strip it
  of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus of the
  whole, and what is it? Why, because my brother Quashy is ignorant
  and weak, and I am intelligent and strong,—because I know how, and
  can do it,—therefore I may steal all he has, keep it, and give him
  only such and so much as suits my fancy! Whatever is too hard, too
  dirty, too disagreeable for me, I may set Quashy to doing. Because I
  don’t like work, Quashy shall work. Because the sun burns me, Quashy
  shall stay in the sun. Quashy shall earn the money, and I will spend
  it. Quashy shall lie down in every puddle, that I may walk over dry
  shod. Quashy shall do my will, and not his, all the days of his
  mortal life, and have such a chance of getting to heaven at last as
  I find convenient. This I take to be about what slavery is. I defy
  anybody on earth to read our slave-code, as it stands in our
  law-books, and make anything else of it. Talk of the abuses of
  slavery! Humbug! The thing itself is the essence of all abuse. And
  the only reason why the land don’t sink under it, like Sodom and
  Gomorrah, is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it
  is. For pity’s sake, for shame’s sake, because we are men born of
  women, and not savage beasts, many of us do not, and dare not,—we
  would scorn to use the full power which our savage laws put into
  our hands. And he who goes the furthest, and does the worst, only
  uses within limits the power that the law gives him!

The author still holds to the opinion that slavery in itself, as legally
defined in law-books and expressed in the records of courts, is the
SUM AND ESSENCE OF ALL ABUSE; and she still clings to the hope that
there are many men at the South infinitely better than their laws;
and after the reader has read all the extracts which she has to make,
for the sake of a common humanity they will hope the same. The author
must state, with regard to some passages which she must quote, that the
language of certain enactments was so incredible that she would not take
it on the authority of any compilation whatever, but copied it with her
own hand from the latest edition of the statute-book where it stood and
still stands.

Footnote 3:

  In this connection it may be well to state that the work of Judge
  Stroud is now out of print, but that a work of the same character is
  in course of preparation by William I. Bowditch, Esq., of Boston,
  which will bring the subject out, by the assistance of the latest
  editions of statutes, and the most recent decisions of courts.




                              CHAPTER II.
                            WHAT IS SLAVERY?


The author will now enter into a consideration of slavery as it stands
revealed in slave law.

[Sidenote: Civil Code, Art. 35.]

[Sidenote: 2 Brev. Dig. 229. Prince’s Digest, 446.]

What is it, according to the definition of law-books and of legal
interpreters? “A slave,” says the law of Louisiana, “is one who is in
the power of a master, to whom he belongs. The master may sell him,
dispose of his person, his industry and his labor; he can do nothing,
possess nothing, nor acquire anything, but what must belong to his
master.” South Carolina says “slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken,
reputed and adjudged in law, to be chattels personal in the hands of
their owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and
assigns, TO ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER.” The law
of Georgia is similar.

[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, 246. State v. Mann.]

Let the reader reflect on the extent of the meaning in this last clause.
Judge Ruffin, pronouncing the opinion of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina, says, a slave is “one doomed in his own person, and his
posterity, to live without knowledge, and without the capacity to make
anything his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits.”

This is what slavery is,—this is what it is to be a slave! The
slave-code, then, of the Southern States, is designed to keep millions
of human beings in the condition of chattels personal; to keep them in a
condition in which the master may sell them, dispose of their time,
person and labor; in which they can do nothing, possess nothing, and
acquire nothing, except for the benefit of the master; in which they are
doomed in themselves and in their posterity to live without knowledge,
without the power to make anything their own,—to toil that another may
reap. The laws of the slave-code are designed to work out this problem,
consistently with the peace of the community, and the safety of that
superior race which is constantly to perpetrate this outrage.

From this simple statement of what the laws of slavery are designed to
do,—from a consideration that the class thus to be reduced, and
oppressed, and made the subjects of a perpetual robbery, are men of
like passions with our own, men originally made in the image of God as
much as ourselves, men partakers of that same humanity of which Jesus
Christ is the highest ideal and expression,—when we consider that the
material thus to be acted upon is that fearfully explosive element, the
soul of man; that soul elastic, upspringing, immortal, whose free will
even the Omnipotence of God refuses to coerce,—we may form some idea of
the tremendous force which is necessary to keep this mightiest of
elements in the state of repression which is contemplated in the
definition of slavery.

Of course, the system necessary to consummate and perpetuate such a
work, from age to age, must be a fearfully stringent one; and our
readers will find that it is so. Men who make the laws, and men who
interpret them, may be fully sensible of their terrible severity and
inhumanity; but, if they are going to preserve the THING, they have no
resource but to make the laws, and to execute them faithfully after they
are made. They may say, with the honorable Judge Ruffin, of North
Carolina, when solemnly from the bench announcing this great foundation
principle of slavery, that “THE POWER OF THE MASTER MUST BE ABSOLUTE, TO
RENDER THE SUBMISSION OF THE SLAVE PERFECT,”—they may say, with him, “I
most freely confess my sense of the harshness of this proposition; I
feel it as deeply as any man can; and, as a principle of moral right,
every person in his retirement must repudiate it;”—but they will also be
obliged to add, with him, “But, in the actual condition of things, it
MUST BE SO. * * This discipline belongs to the state of slavery. * * *
It is INHERENT in the relation of master and slave.”

And, like Judge Ruffin, men of honor, men of humanity, men of kindest
and gentlest feelings, are obliged to interpret these severe laws with
inflexible severity. In the perpetual reaction of that awful force of
human passion and human will, which necessarily meets the compressive
power of slavery,—in that seething, boiling tide, never wholly
repressed, which rolls its volcanic stream underneath the whole
frame-work of society so constituted, ready to find vent at the least
rent or fissure or unguarded aperture,—there is a constant necessity
which urges to severity of law and inflexibility of execution. So Judge
Ruffin says, “We cannot allow the right of the matter to be brought
into discussion in the courts of justice. The slave, to remain a slave,
must be made sensible that there is NO APPEAL FROM HIS MASTER.”
Accordingly, we find in the more southern states, where the slave
population is most accumulated, and slave property most necessary and
valuable, and, of course, the determination to abide by the system the
most decided, there the enactments are most severe, and the
interpretation of courts the most inflexible.[4] And, when legal
decisions of a contrary character begin to be made, it would appear that
it is a symptom of leaning towards emancipation. So abhorrent is the
slave-code to every feeling of humanity, that just as soon as there is
any hesitancy in the community about perpetuating the institution of
slavery, judges begin to listen to the voice of their more honorable
nature, and by favorable interpretations to soften its necessary
severities.

Such decisions do not commend themselves to the professional admiration
of legal gentlemen. But in the workings of the slave system, when the
irresponsible power which it guarantees comes to be used by men of the
most brutal nature, cases sometimes arise for trial where the consistent
exposition of the law involves results so loathsome and frightful, that
the judge prefers to be illogical, rather than inhuman. Like a spring
outgushing in the desert, some noble man, now and then, from the fulness
of his own better nature, throws out a legal decision, generously
inconsistent with every principle and precedent of slave jurisprudence,
and we bless God for it. All we wish is that there were more of them,
for then should we hope that the day of redemption was drawing nigh.

The reader is now prepared to enter with us on the proof of this
proposition: That the slave-code is designed only for the security of
the master, and not with regard to the welfare of the slave.

This is implied in the whole current of law-making and
law-administration, and is often asserted in distinct form, with a
precision and clearness of legal accuracy which, in a literary point of
