to the poor ? Some of the girls she knew went 
to mass, and paid in some curious way to have 
their sins forgiven. She had tried not to sin, to 
be rigorously honest in the workroom, to tell the 
truth — what else was there she could do ? 

Desire's supper-bell rang. Pearl, in her capa- 
city of hostess, invited Mr. Olmstead, who did 
not need much persuasion. He and Miss East- 
wood assisted Miss Barclay, and the others walked 
together. 

"Where is Miss Vasilis.?" asked Pearl. "Will 
you please find her. Desire.?" 

Rhea would not come. She had a headache, 
and did not want any supper. 

"She's a queer little thing," said Sabrina. 
"Sometimes she seems an ignorant, wondering 




child, then there comes such a wild, eerie look in 
her face as makes you almost believe in transmi- 
gration. What will you do with her, Pearl?" 

"I've hardly had time to think. She is one of 
the lonely little waifs, the driftwood of which 
there is so much in cities. It is very hard to be 
anchored to no one." 

The waif raised up her slight figure and looked 
down the grayish road, crossed by long, quivering 
shadows of branching trees. There w^s a sudden 
revolt of the Ishmaelitish blood. She longed to 
get away somewhere else, among her own kind; 
for this would come to an end presently. It filled 
her with such strange thoughts of unattainable 
things. She must go where there was work she 
could do; she must get back to her own life. 
Not in the crowded city and the small, dingy 
room, perhaps — 

She crept softly up-stairs, and flung herself on 
the bed. Her temples throbbed and her eyeballs 
seemed on fire. A light step came across tlie 
hall, and Miss Disbrowe's voice broke the silence 
as she laid her cool hand on the hot brow. 

"My dear child!" she exclaimed, "you are ill 
and feverish. I have hardly had time to look 
after you. Desire will make you a cooling drink. 
Do your eyes hurt ? I will come up again and sit 
with you, and bathe your head " — 



" I want to be alone," Rhea said sharply. Her 
face was turned to the wall. Then, after a mo- 
ment's silence, she added, " You have been very 
good to me. But you don't understand " — 

"You have been too much alone. I think I 
could understand." 

There was no answer or sign of confidence. 
Miss Disbrowe bent and kissed the throbbing 
brow, smoothed the dark, tumbled hair, soft as 
silk. Then, not knowing what better to do, she 
left her, and sent Desire up with iced lemonade ; 
but even Desire's ministrations were repulsed. 

The twilight filled the sky, and made dense 
shadows, sent wafts of fragrance up and down. 
Oh, what was that ? They were singing. She 
heard the rich, penetrating voice of Mr. Olmstead, 
the clear, swelling tones of Miss Eastwood, 
the strange sweetness of Miss Disbrowe's pure 
contralto. It seemed almost as if she could arise 
and join them — her very lips trembled. But no 
— she was not of their kind ; she was so far out- 
side ; and yet it moved her immeasurably. Oh, 
she must get away somewhere ; she could not 
stay and listen, and break her heart over it all. 

She rose as if in a spell, and picked up a few 
of her belongiugs, her precious hoard of money, 
and stole wearily down-stairs. They were all in 
the lighted parlor, but she did not need to pass 



the door. She could go out of the side entrance. 
Bose came and snuffed her, then looked after her 
doubtfully, as if not quite sure of the propriety 
of this nocturnal journey. She hurried on with 
her short step and slight limp, walked so fast, in- 
deed, that now and then she was compelled to 
halt for breath. The old pain came back in her 
side. 

Where she should go, she had not thought. 
Her brain was in a whirl. Did they take this 
road to reach the station.? Was she forgetting 
everything ? It grew darker. The stars came out 
in great throngs, but the moon would be late to- 
night. The trees loomed up ghostly. How aw- 
fully still it was ! She had never been out in the 
wide country at night, though she had threaded 
city streets. She hurried on, frightened, breath- 
less, tired with a kind of deadly fatigue she had 
never known before. Then she dropped down, 
and the rest was sweet. 

When Parke Olmstead went striding along with 
just time to catch the train at Sandon, he saw an 
odd pile of something in the path before him, 
some weary animal doubtless, and he turned 
aside. Then he stepped back, struck a match, and 
glanced sharply. One thin white hand clutched 
a bundle. Why ! surely he had seen the face. 
Could it be Miss Disbrowe's pensioner.? At all 


events they would take her in, and he could think 
of no other place of refuge. 

He lifted her in his arms ; and though she 
seemed light enough at first, he had to pause a 
time or two for breath. Bose came down the 
path and gave a low growl. There were lights 
moving about up-stairs. He spoke cheerfully to 
the dog ; then the hall door was opened. 

" Sakes alive ! " said Desire, " is that you, Mr. 
Olmstead ? Miss Disbrowe's e'en a'most wild ! 
Oh, have you found that child.? She was sick 
or something, and we've been hunting every- 
where " — 

Pearl came flying down, with terrified eyes. 

" Oh, is it Rhea Vasilis ? What can have hap- 
pened ? It must have been the fever. Where 
did you find her ? " 

" Down the road a short distance. She is un- 
conscious, I think. Where shall I take her ? " 

" Bring her up to her rodm, if you will be so 
good. My poor little Rhea ! She has been 
strange these few days back, — homesick, I should 
say, if there had been anything to really long 
for." 

Sabrina was still in her soft, floating gown of 
white, with pale green ribbons. Olmstead always 
remembered the picture she made. 

" What could have possessed the child ! " cried 




Desire. " And here's her bundle tied up — just's 
if she was going to run away ! " 

The helpless hand had unclosed and dropped it. 
Olmstead laid her on the bed. 

" You do not think " — a terror came in Miss 
Eastwood's face. 

" Try rubbing with alcohol. She is not dead. 
She has some pulse, and her heart beats slowly. 
Give her a stimulant. I will wait and see if a 
doctor is needed." 

He led Miss Eastwood down-stairs again. She 
shivered a little. What if there should be some- 
thing serious — of contagion she did not want to 
think. 

Desire rubbed vigorously. What a pinched little 
face, with the wide lids drawn over the large eyes, 
and fringed with long black lashes. The nostrils 
were almost transparent, the chin sharpened, the 
lips thin and colorless. But presently a long, sigh- 
ing breath moved the small frame. 

" Desire — nothing has been said to her ? She 
can't have thought " — 

" Well, she's kinder moped about. I guess I'd 
better let her wiped dishes and such. She wanted 
to. Mebbe she's felt out of place. But every- 
body's been good to her, if that is what you mean. 
There's lots of queer cattle in big cities. Miss 
Pearl, and it isn't to be looked for that they'd fall 





into different ways all in a minute. There ! she's 
come all around." 

Rhea Vasilis opened her eyes wide. 

"What was it ? " she asked. " I thought — I 
meant — I do not belong here, you know." 

" Yes, you do." Pearl pressed the soft hand. 
Then she summoned Mr. Olmstead again. 

" There is a little fever rising, but her pulse is 
stronger. I have one or two remedies with me — 
I have so much occasion for them. If you like to 
trust her to me and your good Mrs. White for the 
night — I do not think there is any real danger. 
In the morning you can summon a physician." 

" Yes," Desire White answered, settling the 
matter with a certain authority. 

Presently the house quieted down. Desire ar- 
ranged a comfortable and pillow on the floor for 
herself ; a high-backed easy-chair,, a table, and a 
lamp in the hall for Mr. Olmstead. Pearl made 
another journey down-stairs, to relieve the fears 
of the ladies. 

Mrs. Duane came out in the hall with her, and 
laid her hand on Pearl's arm. " Poor thing ! " she 
said ; " poor little thing ! What a hard fight it 
must have been with no mother or sister ! She 
seems like some strange flower, grown among 
weeds, that's never had the right kind of soil or 
nourishment. It is harder for the young. My 







dear, God has been so good to us, to me, that I 
want to help do a little work in your garden in 
the ' King's Country. " 

Then she kissed Miss Disbrowe, and slipped 
away. 

Sabrina was waiting up-stairs. " Pearl," she 
began, " I don't want you to run any risk. Are 
you never afraid when you go round in those dens 
and holes ? And I hope she will not turn out an 
ingrate on your hands. Do you suppose she was 
really going away, with that queer little bundle ? 
She's a curious little thing — I shouldn't know 
what to make of her, what to do with her. There 
is such a general complaint among people who 
do charity work " — 

Pearl smiled. " ' We love Him because He first 
loved us.' And maybe that is a part of the great 
gladness that is to transfigure the world — they 
may love us after a while, because we have first 
gone to them and loved them." 

They had gone to well-bred and appreciative 
Miss Barclay. But — down in the very depths — 
and to hope and work for all ! Ah, that was a 
higher grace. Could she — did she care to attain 
unto it } 

The night was in the main quiet. Towards 
morning the fever increased, and Rhea Vasilis 
grew restless and wandering ; but Olm stead saw 





nothing to call for alarm. Soon after daylight 
Amos Pike harnessed up the horse and drove 
Olmstead in to the station,, and brought out the 
village doctor. The fragrance of the morning 
floated about as incense offered from every tree 
and shrub, from the long reaches of dew-gemmed 
grass, and the birds were at their matins. Ah, 
why had man brought woe and want and sorrpw 
into this beautiful world ! Why had he bound 
burdens grievous to be borne on his fellow-man! 
Ah, thank God, there were some hands willing to 
take hold and lighten them a little ! 







CHAPTER VIII 

WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO TURN AND FIGHT 

Olmstead had thrown himself on his own bed 
and taken a late morning nap, and then had a 
solitary breakfast. Calista Spence was of the old 
lady's opinion that " nothing was too good for the 
minister," so he found some unwonted indul- 
gences. After that it had been a busy and per- 
plexing day. Work was slacking up in many of 
the factories. A new scale of wages was being 
considered. Then there was the usual sickness 
in the crowded tenements. For crowded they 
were, even with all the outlying country, — waste 
places that were no longer profitable for farms, 
but too valuable their owners thought for gardens 
for the poorer classes. 

Brentford was not a pretty town, or a town 
reared on the grand foundation of good will to 
men. Some large factories had been established, 
for the economical reason that land and labor were 
cheap. The young men from the adjacent farms 
had rushed in ; then the foreign element crowded 




them hard. Most of the owners and the superin- 
tendents lived elsewhere, communication by rail 
being easy. There were no pretty suburbs ; and 
though there might be families with century-old 
pedigrees, they had not assumed the divine right 
of grandeur. 

Winchester had been away all day. Olmstead 
had taken supper without him. He had gone up- 
stairs now, and stretched himself out by the open 
window for a rest. Late in the afternoon Amos 
Pike had driven in for a few articles, and brought 
him a note from Miss Disbrowe. Miss Vasilis 
had a nervous fever, with some brain trouble, due 
mostly to overwork and an impoverished condition 
of the system. At present there was no danger. 
He could send for his friend at once. 

Yet it was not so much of Pearl Disbrowe he 
was thinking now. The tall, shadowy figure had 
a more seductive grace, the brown eyes an inde- 
scribable light, the lips set in curves so sweet that 
the radiance of her smile was like a subtle, half- 
hidden sunshine. He had fancied out there in the 
old garden that Hollis Winchester might marry 
Miss Eastwood, and round out the suggestive 
romance. He knew now it would be an impossi- 
bility. No alchemy in the whole repertory of na- 
ture could fuse these two souls A certain high 
delicacy in her would forever keep such a man at 





a distance. In spite of his -friendliness, for he 
had come to like Winchester in many respects, he 
was exultantly glad. 

He was dozing off, his mental vision taking in 
Chester House, when a firm step came up the 
stairs. In another moment Winchester had 
marched through, rather flushed and excited, with 
a paper in his hand. 

" See here ! " he began brusquely, pointing to a 
paragraph. " Read this ! "

"Yes," Olmstead returned, as his eye caught 
the headlines, "I stumbled over that in New 
York yesterday, at the office of a friend." 

"They have kept wonderfully close about it. 
Why, they have bought up nearly all Long 
Meadow! Some one, it seems, found a bed of 
clay, and there is a plan for brickmaking. The 
Trenfords are to take their big establishment 
out of the city. The town will be built up in a 
night." He gave a harsh laugh. "A spur of 
the road is planned for their accommodation." 

" It doesn't take long to accomplish such things 
when men take hold in earnest." 

"Long Meadow joins Chester House Farm." 
There was a desperate sort of bitterness in Win- 
chester's tone. 

" Yes," answered Olmstead briefly. 

" They will make a bid for it. She will take it, 
of course." 





"Why 'of course'?" 

" They will offer a big price, and money always 
tempts a woman." 

"As it never does a man," said Olmstead, with 
the good-nature in his voice that one could tell 
was born of a half-smile. 

"Well, a man looks farther on, considers the 
future. I don't mind telling you, Olmstead, that 
I have had some curious dreams about the place. 
I should have begun quite differently years ago. 
When my great-uncle married, he begged my 
grandfather to bring his mill here, and my father 
thought it a good thing. It was supposed Brent- 
ford might rival some of the greater cities, I be- 
lieve. Well, it hasn't. It has filled up with the 
dregs of emigration. Every year it gets worse. 
I think now that my father was crazy to buy the 
old factory and give twice what it was worth ; but 
he was established here, and just then it was 
swell times, and he had a belief that the other 
claim would turn out to be a fraud. Then business 
dropped down, and he had hard work to weather 
the storm, but he did. If he had merely leased 
the factory for a term of years, I should have 
thrown it up and gone off to some wholesomer, 
cleaner place. I have driven over that tract time 
and again, and thought of the fine site, gloated 
over it ! If I could have bought Chester House 







when this girl came of age, Fd have moved heaven 
and earth, formed a syndicate, done anything to 
compass my dream. So Fve kept it to myself. 
But no man seems to have a monopoly of ideas. 
And now the thing is done, and I am not in it 
at all." 

The lingering undercurrent in his voice would 
have been a tremble had he held himself less rig- 
orously in hand. The repressed emotion touched 
Olmstead keenly. 

"Why don't you make her another offer for 
it, Winchester ? " 

He laughed contemptuously, with a touch of 
cruel discordance. 

" You have been there," he resumed, after a 
long pause ; " what kind of a fad is it ? She 
may donate a Home for Incapables to the new 
town. The Eastwood Home. Has she taken 
orders ? " 

" She has very little to do with it. I wish you 
really knew Miss Disbrowe. Many of her ideas 
would suit you to a dot. She isn't weakly or 
sentimentally charitable. She believes in help- 
ing people to help themselves, and thinks the 
truest kindness one can do a fellow-creature, 
man or woman, is to put them in a way of self- 
support. This is the kind of home to which 
any lady might invite a friend, rich or poor." 





" No, Miss Eastwood isn't the kind to shoulder 
such an enterprise. She might give the house 
away ; she wouldn't go round in the slums to 
find people to fill it. She must have taken her 
style from the Eastwood side. You have seen 
her playing at charity. I haven't any doubt 
but that she was superlatively graceful! Well, 
I have seen her as one of the stars of society. 
She has the Vere-de-Vere manner. Do they all 
fall on their knees when she raises her hand ? " 

"Winchester, you are positively cantankerous! 
You gibe alike at her, whether she affects society 
or the chosen gray of some sisterhood. You have 
managed to carry away a distorted idea of her, 
quite unfair. Both are charming young women. 
They have a man and a maid, a horse and a dog. 
The house and the garden still hold their quaint, 
beautiful seclusion. Why shouldn't these girls of 
leisure try to do a little uplifting in the world ? 
Heaven knows there is need enough of it ! " 

" There is a deal of viciousness in this fashion- 
able benevolence. The schemers come to depend 
on it, to demand it. Let them take their own 
money. Why, see here, instead, I have not had 
a pleasure journey in years ! I have had other 
things to take my time. Yet I am in a fair condi- 
tion," with a sarcastic intonation. 

" Maybe, if you lived in some of the filthy dens 




where Tve found even your people, Winchester, 
you would like a day or a week out, to see the real 
sky, where it isn't obscured by smoke, and long 
reaches of meadows, shady, fragrant woodlands, 
or a bit of the ocean. You have a roomy, com- 
fortable home, good food, luxuries, reading, and 
some leisure ; a day off, now and then, even if 
it is business journeys, variety, aims, and ambi- 
tions " — 

"And I wonder how many of the men down 
yonder would have kept at it as I did ! You have 
never had a big business on your hands, Olmstead, 
— orders to fill, and men turning sulky and go- 
ing out on strikes ; payments to meet, and some 
of the men you depended on giving you notice 
at the last moment they could not come to time. 
I have run things very light-handed now and 
then. I have spent whole nights down at the mill. 
And they grudge me success ! "

"Did you ever think these people are largely 
what the methods of the past and to-day make 
them } When the conditions of life are not quite 
so hard, there is a general improvement, better 
health, less overcrowding. When you come to 
give a man a decent share of prosperity, you 
rouse ambition in him. Then you can appeal 
to him ; but what appeal can you make to the 
denizens of saloons.^ And you employers have 




not made much effort to provide better things. 
When you think of it, Winchester, isn't it a lit- 
tle unreasonable for you to expect a man to use 
his most eager and earnest efforts to help you 
to acquire a fortune?" 

"But do you not see it is to his interest ? The 
more employment there is, the less likely he is to 
be out of work. If I were content to make a bare 
living, fifty of my men would be idle to-morrow." 

" But if depression in business sweeps over the 
land, are you going to spend your money to give 
work and bread ? " 

"Oh, men have done this," said Winchester in 
a tone of lofty indifference. 

" All honor to them, then ! " 

" You clergymen theorize a good deal. If you 
had the hard, practical part on your hands " — 

"We see the results. I do not think, Winches- 
ter, that we take upon ourselves any vow or duty 
to preach to men the advisability of laying, up 
treasures here on earth. The Golden Rule may 
be visionary, but the eternal laws of justice are 
founded on it. The great question is how thor- 
oughly or truly one believes in another life. He 
cannot take it for himself and be indifferent 
to his neighbor's welfare. He is his brother's 
keeper, whether he likes it or not. Even in 
this world his selfish indifference often reacts, 





and he suffers from it. But if you think the 
piling up of money is the greatest good, if you 
are willing to concentrate every faculty of soul 
and body in that one pursuit, then grant us the 
same liberty. Let us pursue our ideal with a 
purpose as resolute. If we honestly believe we 
can better the world a little, if we have a mes- 
sage from the Master to deliver, shall we be 
less diligent in our spiritual things than you in 
your temporal work for that which you admit 
ends with life } If these two young girls choose 
to give up the gay world for a season, and make 
a bit of the greater 'King's Country' in the old 
house you love so well, depend upon it, no evil 
can grow out of it. Come over and see them. 
Perhaps you and Miss Eastwood can reach some 
basis of readjustment. Be first in the field with 
your offer. If she really knew" — 

"She knows," he replied with a scornful in- 
flection. " She is to carry out her mother's 
bitterness." 

" But the law, you admit, proved her mother 
right. As I understand the case, the mistake 
was on your side. Yet I do not think the place 
has any tender associations for her." 

What had happened be'tweeri these two people } 
Not love — neither of them betrayed the slightest 
consciousness, of itself a subtle betrayal. Win- 





Chester's was a kind of vindictiveness toward the 
woman who had thwarted him ; her's, a rather 
amused indifference. Winchester was an odd 
compound. He had some admirable qualities, 
but he was the kind of man who let nothing 
stand in his way when he had resolved upon his 
purpose. 

The man suddenly turned on his heel, tramped 
down the stairs, paused to light a cigar, and 
then strode out on the country road. He could 
have gone on and quarrelled with Olmstead, but 
one thing the clergyman said struck home. He 
had a right to be in earnest with his work. 
He admired the sturdy common-sense Olmstead 
brought to the fore. Then, too, he knew he 
was here temporarily. Winchester was angry and 
disappointed. That other eyes had seen the pos- 
sibility he had gloated over in secret, set him 
beside himself. 

More than two years ago his plans had taken 
definite shape. He hated Brentford. Year after 
year a steady disgust had penetrated his whole 
being. His father had made a short-sighted mis- 
take. He did not hold it against him with any 
sense of anger. It had seemed best then. A 
good deal of money and energy had been spent 
here, and if he went on, half the mill, at least, 
must be rebuilt. Labor disturbances were im- 



pending. In a short time he intended to shut 
down for repairs. 

He had meant to consider his best interests 
quite at his leisure ; but these new plans roused 
him to white heat. If men of note came to Long 
Meadow and a new, clean, convenient place was 
attractive, Brentford would be pushed to the 
wall, become a dead town, unless some earthquake 
shook it up and toppled it over the old ruins. 
While he had been straining every nerve to make 
money, and scheming to repossess Chester House, 
this plan had come into existence like a thief in 
the night, and he had no hand in it. 

Already one of the large establishments had 
been taken out of the town. To rebuild would 
be absolutely throwing away money. And, cu- 
riously enough, this season, the old hope had 
awakened within him. He let nothing concern- 
ing Chester House escape him. If there should 
be some difficulty in renting it ! The house was 
hardly up to the requirements of fashion. She 
really might desire to dispose of it, if not directly 
to him. 


The episode of their brief acquaintance was not 
pleasant to remember. It was amazing to him, 
in the retrospect, that with his experience and 
judgment he should have ruined his cause. Any 
woman of pride would have done as she did. He 





had no desire to meet Miss Eastwood. Yet the 
knowledge that Olmstead had a sort of vested 
right in Chester House filled him with secret 
mortification. He really knew so little about 
Miss Eastwood ; in the hands of a scheming 
woman she might be induced to consent to any 
romantic charity. 

How many times he had driven about the place, 
generally on Sunday morning ! It was such a 
relief to get out in the clear, wide country, away 
from the sights and sounds of poverty, toil, and 
flaunting saloons! If one could start anew in a 
fresh, modern way, with large rooms, new machin- 
ery, and the pick of employees ! If others came, 
it would not require many of the forces of to-day 
to build a new town. 

And the dream slipped to the old ending. He 
was there with his children playing under the 
trees, their mother walking with them, holding a 
tiny hand in hers. He had no special ideals. 
There had not been much time in his busy life 
to think about women. Some one fair and gra- 
cious, with a subtle sweetness like the fragrance 
of a flower. He had never wasted his energies 
on flirtations ; perhaps, if he had studied women 
a little more closely, he would have escaped his 
tremendous blunder. 

How curious that a man's dearest wishes should 





be so persistently frustrated ! He could buy back 
Chester House ; he was in better shape than two 
years ago. But if he should again sink a large 
sum in the mill ! 

Olmstead heard Winchester come in quite late. 
He had been asleep, but he could guess the man's 
ill-temper had not all abated. However, he was 
briefly cordial the next morning. Olmstead hur- 
ried down to the city for a conference with Marcia 
Golding, and found Ruth Searle an inmate of her 
hospitable little nest, which, for the sake of her 
divine Master, was always open to the cry of the 
needy. 

" What a wonderful providence ! " she cried with 
a smile. " And Miss Eastwood ! I have been hear- 
ing about her as a society belle and an heiress. 
Are we converting the world to our faith and 
usages } " 

" I don't know that she is converted really." 
He flushed a little as he said this, and was vexed 
with himself that he should do so without cause. 
" It is Miss Disbrowe who has the faith and works, 
and Miss Eastwood the money." He gave a short, 
conventional laugh, as if something was not yet 
well adjusted. 

"Then it is a promising partnership. We are 
glad to have doing good fashionable, if it is not 
done by stealth. I do not see why it should be, 




if it is not ostentatious. Shall we ever reach the 
millennium, when love to one's neighbor will simply 
cover the whole ground ? What a conservation of 
the forces there will be, when you are not contin- 
ually making up for the shortcomings of the other 
half of the world ! " 

"When every one helps, it will be the millen- 
nium," he returned. "But it is a long way off, 
I am afraid." 

"We go forward in the Master's name. But 
for that we might be discouraged." 

Miss Golding had reached middle life, even 
if one sets the limit at fourscore. She was a 
wise, sympathizing, and congenial friend to more 
than one like Parke Olmstead or Ruth Searle. 
Perhaps he never knew, and I am sure she did 
not, how much she had done towards shaping 
his present purposes. Her life had made her 
fair and attractive, with the larger graces of gen- 
erous womanhood. She had been realizing and 
accepting her special gifts, and finding their pur- 
poses, and the gracious harmony looked out of 
her serene eyes.
