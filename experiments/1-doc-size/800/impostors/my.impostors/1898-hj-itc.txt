fancy, in some directions so alert, had never 
a throb of response for any sign of the sordid. 
The men she did follow, moreover, she fol 
lowed mainly in one relation, the relation as 
to which the cage convinced her, she be- 
.lieved, more than anything else could have 
done, that it was quite the most diffused. 

She found her ladies, in short, almost 
always in communication with her gentle 
men, and her gentlemen with her ladies, and 
she read into the immensity of their inter 
course stories and meanings without end. 





Incontestibly she grew to think that the men 
cut the best figure ; and in this particular, 
as in many others, she arrived at a philos 
ophy of her own, all made up of her private 
notations and cynicisms. It was a striking 
part of the business, for example, that it was 
much more the women, on the whole, who 
were after the men than the men who were 
after the women ; it was literally visible that 
the general attitude of the one sex was that 
of the object pursued and defensive, apolo 
getic and attenuating, while the light of her 
own nature helped her more or less to con 
clude as to the attitude of the other. Per 
haps she herself a little even fell into the 
custom of pursuit in occasionally deviating 
only for gentlemen from her high rigour 
about the stamps. She had early in the day 
made up her mind, in fine, that they had the 
best manners; and if there were none of 
them she noticed when Captain Everard was 
there, there were plenty she could place and 
trace and name at other times, plenty who, 
with their way of being nice to her, and of 





handling, as if their pockets were private 
tills, loose, mixed masses of silver and gold, 
were such pleasant appearances that she 
could envy them without dislike. They 
never had to give change they only had to 
get it. They ranged through every sugges 
tion, every shade of fortune, which evidently 
included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of 
good, declining even toward Mr. Mudge and 
his bland, firm thrift, and ascending, in wild 
signals and rocket-flights, almost to within 
hail of her highest standard. So, from month 
to month, she went on with them all, through 
a thousand ups and downs and a thousand 
pangs and indifferences. What virtually hap 
pened was that in the shuffling herd that 
passed before her by far the greater part only 
passed a proportion but just appreciable 
stayed. Most of the elements swam straight 
away, lost themselves in the bottomless com 
mon, and by so doing really kept the page 
clear. On the clearness, therefore, what she 
did retain stood sharply out ; she nipped and 
caught it, turned it over and interwove it. 



VI 

She met Mrs. Jordan whenever she could, 
and learned from her more and more how 
the great people, under her gentle shake, 
and after going through everything with the 
mere shops, were waking up to the gain of 
putting into the hands of a person of real 
refinement the question that the shop-people 
spoke of so vulgarly as that of the floral 
decorations. The regular dealers in these 
decorations were all very well; but there 
was a peculiar magic in the play of taste of 
a lady who had only to remember, through 
whatever intervening dusk, all her own little 
tables, little bowls and little jars and little 
other arrangements, and the wonderful thing 
she had made of the garden of the vicarage. 
This small domain, which her young friend 
had never seen, bloomed in Mrs. Jordan 's 
discourse like a new Eden, and she con 
verted the past into a bank of violets by the 







tone in which she said, Of course you always 
knew my one passion! She obviously met 
now, at any rate, a big contemporary need, 
measured what it was rapidly becoming for 
people to feel they could trust her without a 
tremor. It brought them a peace that 
during the quarter of an hour before dinner 
in especial was worth more to them than 
mere payment could express. Mere pay 
ment, none the less, was tolerably prompt ; 
she engaged by the month, taking over the 
whole thing; and there was an evening on 
which, in respect to our heroine, she at last 
returned to the charge. It 's growing and 
growing, and I see that I must really divide 
the work. One wants an associate of one 's 
own kind, don't you know? You know the 
look they want it all to have? of having 
come, not from a florist, but from one of 
themselves. Well, I'm sure you could give 
it because you are one. Then we should 
win. Therefore just come in with me. 

And leave the P. O.? 

Let the P. O. simply bring you your 





letters. It would bring you lots, you'd see; 
orders, after a bit, by the dozen. It was 
on this, in due course, that the great advan 
tage again came up : One seems to live again 
with one 's own people. It had taken some 
little time (after their having parted com 
pany in the tempest of their troubles and 
then, in the glimmering dawn, finally sighted 
each other again) for each to admit that the 
other was, in her private circle, her only 
equal ; but the admission came, when it did 
come, with an honest groan, and since 
equality was named each found much per 
sonal profit in exaggerating the other 's origi 
nal grandeur. Mrs. Jordan was ten years the 
older, but her young friend was struck with 
the smaller difference this now made ; it had 
counted otherwise at the time when, much 
more as a friend of her mother's, the be 
reaved lady, without a penny of provision, 
and with stopgaps, like their own, all gone, 
had, across the sordid landing on which the 
opposite doors of the pair of scared miseries 
opened and to which they were bewilderedly 





bolted, borrowed coals and umbrellas that 
were repaid in potatoes and postage-stamps. 
It had been a questionable help, at that time, 
to ladies submerged, floundering, panting, 
swimming for their lives, that they were 
ladies ; but such an advantage could come up 
again in proportion as others vanished, and 
it had grown very great by the time it was 
the only ghost of one they possessed. They 
had literally watched it take to itself a por 
tion of the substance of each that had de 
parted ; and it became prodigious now, when 
they could talk of it together, when they 
could look back at it across a desert of 
accepted derogation, and when, above all, 
they could draw from each other a credulity 
about it that they could draw from no one 
else. Nothing was really so marked as that 
they felt the need to cultivate this legend 
much more after having found their feet and 
stayed their stomachs in the ultimate obscure 
than they had done in the upper air of mere 
frequent shocks. The thing they could now 
oftenest say to each other was that they 





knew what they meant, and the sentiment 
with which, all round, they knew it was 
known had been a kind of promise to stick 
well together again. 

Mrs. Jordan was at present fairly dazzling 
on the subject of the way that, in the practice 
of her beautiful art, she more than peeped 
in she penetrated. There was not a house 
of the great kind and it was, of course, 
only a question of those real homes of lux 
ury in which she was not, at the rate such 
people now had things, all over the place. 
The girl felt before the picture the cold 
breath of disinheritance as much as she had 
ever felt it in the cage; she knew, more 
over, how much she betrayed this, for the 
experience of poverty had begun, in her life, 
too early, and her ignorance of the require 
ments of homes of luxury had grown, with 
other active knowledge, a depth of simpli 
fication. She had accordingly at first often 
found that in these colloquies she could only 
pretend she understood. Educated as she 
had rapidly been by her chances at Cocker 's 





there were still strange gaps in her learning 
she could never, like Mrs. Jordan, have 
found her way about one of the homes. 
Little by little, however, she had caught on, 
above all in the light of what Mrs. Jordan 's 
redemption had materially made of that 
lady, giving her, though the years and the 
struggles had naturally not straightened a 
feature, an almost super-eminent air. There 
were women in and out of Cocker 's who 
were quite nice and who yet didn' t look well ; 
whereas Mrs. Jordan looked well and yet, 
with her extraordinarily protrusive teeth, 
was by no means quite nice. It would seem, 
mystifyingly, that it might really come from 
all the greatness she could live with. It was 
fine to hear her talk so often of dinners of 
twenty and of her doing, as she said, exactly 
as she liked with them. She spoke as if, for 
that matter, she invited the company. 
They simply give me the table all the rest, 
all the other effects, come afterwards. 



VII 

Then you do see them? the girl again 
asked. 

Mrs. Jordan hesitated, and indeed the 
point had been ambiguous before. Do you 
mean the guests? 

Her young friend, cautious about an 
undue exposure of innocence, was not quite 
sure. Well the people who live there. 

Lady Ventnor? Mrs. Bubb? Lord Rye? 
Dear, yes. Why, they like one. 

But does one personally know them? our 
young lady went on, since that was the way 
to speak. I mean socially, don't you know ? 
as you know me. 

They're not so nice as you! Mrs. Jordan 
charmingly cried. But I shall see more and 
more of them. 

Ah, this was the old story. But how 
soon? 

Why, almost any day. Of course, Mrs. 







Jordan honestly added, they're nearly 
always out. 

Then why do they want flowers all over? 

Oh, that doen' t make any difference. 
Mrs. Jordan was not philosophic; she was 
only evidently determined it shouldn't make 
any. They're awfully interested in my 
ideas, and it 's inevitable they should meet 
me over them. 

Her interlocutress was sturdy enough. 

What do you call your ideas? 

Mrs. Jordan 's reply was fine. If you 
were to see me some day with a thousand 
tulips, you'd soon discover. 

A thousand? the girl gasped at such a 
revelation of the scale of it; she felt, for 
the instant, fairly planted out. Well, but 
if in fact they never do meet you? she none 
the less pessimistically insisted. 

Never? They often do and evidently 
quite on purpose. We have grand long 
talks. 

There was something in our young lady 
that could still stay her from asking for a 





personal description of these apparitions; 
that showed too starved a state. But while 
she considered she took in afresh the whole 
of the clergyman. 's widow. Mrs.^ Jordan 
couldn't help her teeth, and her sleeves 
were a distinct rise in the world. A thou 
sand tulips at a shilling clearly took one 
further than a thousand words at a penny ; 
and the betrothed of Mr. Mudge, in whom 
the sense of the race for life was always 
acute, found herself wondering, with a 
twinge of her easy jealousy, if it mightn't 
after all then, for her also, be better better 
than where she was to follow some such 
scent. Where she was was where Mr. Buck- 
ton 's elbow could freely enter her right side 
and the counter-clerk 's breathing he had 
something the matter with his nose pervade 
her left ear. It was something to fill an office 
under government, and she knew but too 
well there were places commoner still than 
Cocker s; but it never required much of a 
chance to bring back to her the picture of 
servitude and promiscuity that she must 





present to the eye of comparative freedom. 
She was so boxed up with her young men, 
and anything like a margin so absent, that it 
needed more art than she should ever possess 
to pretend in the least to compass, with any 
one in the nature of an acquaintance say 
with Mrs. Jordan herself, flying in, as it 
might happen, to wire sympathetically to 
Mrs. Bubb an approach to a relation of 
elegant privacy. She remembered the day 
when Mrs. Jordan had, in fact, by the great 
est chance, come in with fifty-three words 
for Lord Rye and a five-pound note to 
change. This had been the dramatic man 
ner of their reunion their mutual recogni 
tion was so great an event. The girl could 
at first only see her from the waist up, 
besides making but little of her long tele 
gram to his lordship. It was a strange 
whirligig that had converted the clergyman 's 
widow into such a specimen of the class 
that went beyond the sixpence. 

Nothing of the occasion, all the more, had 
ever become dim ; least of all the way that, 





as her recovered friend looked up from 
counting, Mrs. Jordan had just blown, in 
explanation, through her teeth and through 
the bars of the cage: I do flowers, you 
know. Our young woman had always, 
with her little finger crooked out, a pretty 
movement for counting; and she had not 
forgotten the small secret advantage, a sharp 
ness of triumph it might even have been 
called, that fell upon her at this moment and 
avenged her for the incoherency of the 
message, an unintelligible enumeration of 
numbers, colors, days, hours. The corres 
pondence of people she didn' t know was one 
thing ; but the correspondence of people she 
did had an aspect of its own for her, even 
when she couldn't understand it. The 
speech in which Mrs. Jordan had defined a 
position and announced a profession was 
like a tinkle of bluebells; but, for herself, 
her one idea about flowers was that people 
had them at funerals, and her present sole 
gleam of light was that lords probably had 
them most. When she watched, a minute 




later, through the cage, the swing of her 
visitor 's departing petticoats, she saw the 
sight from the waist down ; and when the 
counter-clerk, after a mere male glance, 
remarked, with an intention unmistakably 
low, Handsome woman! she had for him 
the finest of her chills: She 's the widow 
of a bishop. She always felt, with the 
counter-clerk, that it was impossible suf- 
ficently to put it on; for what she wished 
to express to him was the maximum of her 
contempt, and that element in her nature 
was confusedly stored. A bishop was 
putting it on, but the counter-clerk 's ap 
proaches were vile. The night, after this, 
when, in the fulness of time, Mrs. Jordan 
mentioned the grand long talks, the girl at 
last brought out: Should I see them? I 
mean if I were to give up everything for you. 

Mrs. Jordan at this became most arch. 
I'd send you to all the bachelors! 

Our young lady could be reminded by such 
a remark that she usually struck her friend 
as pretty. Do you have their flowers? 



  

Oceans. And they're the most particular. 
Oh, it was a wonderful world. You 
should see Lord Rye's. 

His flowers? 

Yes, and his letters. He writes me pages 
on pages with the most adorable little 
drawings and plans. You should see his 
diagrams! 






VIII 

The girl had in course of time every 
opportunity to inspect these documents, and 
they a little disappointed her; but in the 
meanwhile there had been more talk, and it 
had led to her saying, as if her friend 's 
guarantee of a life of elegance were not 
quite definite: "Well, I see every one at my 
place. 

Every one? 

Lots of swells. They flock. They live, 
you know, all round, and the place is filled 
with all the smart people, all the fast people, 
those whose names are in the papers mam 
ma has still the Morning Post and who 
come up for the season. 

Mrs. Jordan took this in with complete 
intelligence. Yes, and I dare say it 's some 
of your people that I do. 

Her companion assented, but discrim 
inated. I doubt if you "do" them as much 







as I ! Their affairs, their appointments and 
arrangements, their little games and secrets 
and vices those things all pass before me. 

This was a picture that could, impose on 
a clergyman 's widow a certain strain; it was 
in intention, moreover, something of a retort 
to the thousand tulips. Their vices? Have 
they got vices? 

Our young critic even more remarkably 
stared; then with a touch of contempt in 
her amusement: Haven't you found that 
out? The homes of luxury, then, hadn't so 
much to give.  I  find out everything, she 
continued. 

Mrs. Jordan, at bottom a very meek 
person, was visibly struck. I see. You 
do "have" them. 

Oh, I don't care! Much good does it do me! 

Mrs. Jordan, after an instant, recovered 
her superiority. No it doesn' t lead to 
much. Her own initiations so clearly did. 
Still after all; and she was not jealous: 
There must be a charm. 

In seeing them? At this the girl sud- 





denly let herself go. I hate them; there 's 
that charm! 

Mrs. Jordan gaped again. The real 
"smarts"? 

Is that what you call Mrs. Bubb? Yes 
it comes to me; I've had Mrs. Bubb. I 
don't think she has been in herself, but 
there are things her maid has brought. 
Well, my dear! and the young person from 
Cocker's, recalling these things and summing 
them up, seemed suddenly to have much to 
say. But she didn' t say it; she checked it; 
she only brought out: Her maid, who 's 
horrid she must have her ! Then she went 
on with indifference: They're too real! 
They're selfish brutes. 

Mrs. Jordan, turning it over, adopted at 
last the plan of treating it with a smile. She 
wished to be liberal. Well, of course, they 
do lay it out. 

They bore me to death, her companion 
pursued with slightly more temperance. 

But this was going too far. 4 Ah, that 's 
because you've no sympathy! 





The girl gave an ironic laugh, only retort 
ing that she wouldn't have any either if she 
had to count all day all the words in the 
dictionary; a contention Mrs. Jordan quite 
granted, the more that she shuddered at the 
notion of ever failing of the very gift to 
which she owed the vogue the rage she 
might call it that had caught her up. 
Without sympathy or without imagination, 
for it came back again to that how should 
she get, for big dinners, down the middle 
and toward the far corners at all? It wasn' t 
the combinations, which were easily man 
aged : the strain was over the ineffable sim 
plicities, those that the bachelors above all, 
and Lord Rye perhaps most of any, threw 
off just blew off, like cigarette-puffs such 
sketches of. The betrothed of Mr. Mudge 
at all events accepted the explanation, which 
had the effect, as almost any turn of their 
talk was now apt to have, of bringing her 
round to the terrific question of that gentle 
man. She was tormented with the desire to 
get out of Mrs. Jordan, on this subject, what 





she was sure was at the back of Mrs. Jor 
dan 's head; and to get it out of her, queerly 
enough, if only to vent a certain irritation 
at it. She knew that what her friend would 
already have risked if she had not been 
timid and tortuous was : Give him up yes, 
give him up : you ll see that with your sure 
chances you ll be able to do much better. 
Our young woman had a sense that if that 
view could only be put before her with a 
particular sniff for poor Mr. Mudge she 
should hate it as much as she morally ought. 
She was conscious of not, as yet, hating it 
quite so much as that. But she saw that 
Mrs. Jordan was conscious of something 
too, and that there was a sort of assurance 
she was waiting little by little to gather. 
The day came when the girl caught a 
glimpse of what was still wanting to make 
her friend feel strong; which was nothing 
less than the prospect of being able to 
announce the climax of sundry private 
dreams. The associate of the aristocracy 
had personal calculations she pored over 





them in her lonely lodgings. If she did the 
flowers for the bachelors, in short, didn' t she 
expect that to have consequences very differ 
ent from the outlook, at Cocker's, that she 
had described as leading to nothing? There 
seemed in very truth something auspicious 
in the mixture of bachelors and flowers, 
though, when looked hard in the eye, Mrs. 
Jordan was not quite prepared to say she 
had expected a positive proposal from Lord 
Rye to pop out of it. Our young woman 
arrived at last, none the less, at a definite 
vision of what was in her mind. This was 
a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of 
Mr. Mudge would, unless conciliated in 
advance by a successful rescue, almost hate 
her on the day she should break a particular 
piece of news. How could that unfortunate 
otherwise endure to hear of what, under the 
protection of Lady Ventnor, was after all so 
possible? 



IX 

Meanwhile, since irritation sometimes 
relieved her, the betrothed of Mr. Mudge 
drew straight from that admirer an amount 
of it that was proportioned to her fidelity. 
She always walked with him on Sundays, 
usually in the Regent 's Park, and quite 
often, once or twice a month, he took her, 
in the Strand or thereabouts, to see a piece 
that was having a run. The productions he 
always preferred were the really good ones 
Shakespeare, Thompson or some funny 
American thing; which, as it also happened 
that she hated vulgar plays, gave him ground 
for what was almost the fondest of his 
approaches, the theory that their tastes 
were, blissfully, just the same. He was for 
ever reminding her of that, rejoicing over 
it, and being affectionate and wise about it. 

There were times when she wondered how 
in the world she could bear him, how she 







could bear any man so smugly unconscious 
of the immensity of her difference. It was 
just for this difference that, if she was to be 
liked at all, she wanted to be liked, and if 
that was not the source of Mr. Mudge 's 
admiration, she asked herself, what on earth 
could be? She was not different only at one 
point, she was different all round; unless 
perhaps indeed in being practically human, 
which her mind just barely recognised that 
he also was. She would have made tremen 
dous concessions in other quarters: there 
was no limit, for instance, to those she would 
have made to Captain Everard ; but what I 
have named was the most she was prepared 
to do for Mr. Mudge. It was because he 
was different that, in the oddest way, she 
liked as well as deplored him; which was 
after all a proof that the disparity, should 
they frankly recognise it, wouldn't neces 
sarily be fatal. She felt that, oleaginous 
too oleaginous as he was, he was somehow 
comparatively primitive: she had once, 
during the portion of his time at Cocker 's 





that had overlapped her own, seen him 
collar *a drunken soldier, a big, violent man, 
who, having come in with a mate to get a 
postal-order cashed, had made a grab at the 
money before his friend could reach it and 
had so produced, among the hams and 
cheeses and the lodgers from Thrupp's, 
reprisals instantly ensuing, a scene of scan 
dal and consternation. Mr. Buckton and the 
counter-clerk had crouched within the cage, 
but Mr. Mudge had, with a very quiet but 
very quick slep round the counter, trium 
phantly interposed in the scrimmage, parted 
the combatants and shaken the delinquent 
in his skin. She had been proud of him at 
that moment and had felt that if their affair 
had not already been settled the neatness 
of his execution would have left her with 
out resistance. 

Their affair had been settled by other 
things: by the evident sincerity of his passion 
and by the sense that his high white apron 
resembled a front of many floors. It had 
gone a great way with her that he would 





build up a business to his chin, which 
he carried quite in the air. This could 
only be a question of time ; he would have 
all Piccadilly in the pen behind his ear. 
That was a merit in itself for a girl who had 
known what she had known. There were 
hours at which she even found him good- 
looking, though, frankly, there could be no 
crown for her effort to imagine, on the part 
of the tailor or the barber, some such treat 
ment of his appearance as would make him 
resemble even remotely a gentleman. His 
very beauty was the beauty of a grocer, and 
the finest future would offer it none too much 
room to expand. She had engaged herself, 
in short, to the perfection of a type, and 
perfection of anything was much for a per 
son who, out of early troubles, had just 
escaped with her life. But it contributed 
hugely at present to carry on the two paral 
lel lines of her contacts in the cage and her 
contacts out of it. After keeping quiet for 
some time about this opposition she sud 
denly one Sunday afternoon on a penny 





chair in the Regent 's Park broke, for him, 
capriciously, bewilderingly, into an intima 
tion of what it came to. He naturally pressed 
more and more on the subject of her again 
placing herself where he could see her 
hourly, and for her to recognise that since 
she had as yet given him no sane reason for 
delay she had no need to hear him say that 
he couldn't make out what she was up to. As 
if, with her absurd bad reasons, she knew it 
herself! Sometimes she thought it would 
be amusing to let him have them full in the 
face, for she felt she should die of him unless 
she once in a while stupefied him ; and some 
times she thought it would be disgusting and 
perhaps even fatal. She liked him, how 
ever, to think her silly, for that gave her the 
margin which, at the best, she would always 
require; and the only difficulty about this 
was that he hadn't enough imagination to 
oblige her. It produced, none the less, 
something of the desired effect to leave him 
simply wondering why, over the matter of 
their reunion, she didn' t yield to his argu- 





ments. Then at last, simply as if by acci 
dent and out of mere boredom on a day that 
was rather flat, she preposterously produced 
her own. Well, wait a bit. Where I am I 
still see things. And she talked to him 
even worse, if possible, than she had talked 
to Mrs. Jordan. 

Little by little, to her own stupefaction, 
she caught that he was trying to take it as 
she meant it and that he was neither aston 
ished nor angry. Oh, the British trades 
man this gave her an idea of his resources ! 
Mr. Mudge would be angry only with a 
person who, like the drunken soldier in the
