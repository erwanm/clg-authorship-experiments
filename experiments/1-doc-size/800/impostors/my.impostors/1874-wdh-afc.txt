" No, but if you loved her, the money would en 
able you to marry her." 

" Listen to me, Don Ippolito. I never said that 
I loved Miss Vervain, and I don 't know how you 
feel warranted in speaking to me about the matter. 
Why do you do so ? " 

" I ? Why ? I could not but imagine that you 
must love her. Is there anything wrong in speak 
ing of such things ? Is it contrary to the American 
custom? I ask pardon from my heart if I have 
done anything amiss." 

" There is no offense," said the painter, with a 
laugh, " and I don 't wonder you thought I ought to 
be in love with Miss Vervain. She is beautiful, and 
I believe she's good. But if men had to marry 
because women were beautiful and good, there isn 't  
one of us could live single a day. Besides, I'm the 
victim of another passion, I'm laboring under an 
unrequited affection for Art." 

" Then you do not love her ? " asked Don Ippo 
lito, eagerly. 

" So far as I'm advised at present, no, I don t." 

" It is strange ! " said the priest, absently, but 
with a glowing face. 

He quitted the painter's and walked swiftly 
homeward with a triumphant buoyancy of step. 
A subtle content diffused itself over his face, and 
a joyful light burnt in his deep eyes. He sat down 
before the piano and organ as he had arranged 
them, and began to strike their keys in unison ; this 



 

seemed to him for the first time childish. Then he 
played some lively bars on the piano alone ; they 
sounded too light and trivial, and he turned to the 
other instrument. As the plaint of the reeds arose, 
it filled his sense like a solemn organ-music, and 
transfigured the place ; the notes swelled to the 
ample vault of a church, and at the high altar he 
was celebrating the mass in his sacerdotal robes. 
He suddenly caught his fingers away from the keys ; 
his breast heaved, he hid his face in his hands. 



VII. 

FERRIS stood cleaning his palette, after Don Ip- 
polito was gone, scraping the colors together with 
his knife and neatly buttering them on the palette's 
edge, while he wondered what the priest meant by 
pumping him in that way. Nothing, he supposed, 
and yet it was odd. Of course she had a bad tem 
per 

He put on his hat and coat and strolled vaguely 
forth, and in an hour or two came by a roundabout 
course to the gondola station nearest his own house. 
There he stopped, and after an absent contemplation 
of the boats, from which the gondoliers were clam 
oring for his custom, he stepped into one and or 
dered the man to row him to a gate on a small canal 
opposite. The gate opened, at his ringing, into 
the garden of the Vervains. 

Florida was sitting alone on a bench near the 
fountain. It was no longer a ruined fountain ; the 
broken-nosed naiad held a pipe above her head, 
and from this rose a willowy spray high enough to 
catch some colors of the sunset then striking into 
the garden, and fell again in a mist around her, 
making her almost modest. 

" What does this mean ? " asked Ferris, care- 



 

lessly taking the young girl's hand. " I thought 
this lady's occupation was gone." 

" Don Ippolito repaired the fountain for the land 
lord, and he agreed to pay for filling the tank that 
feeds it," said Florida. " He seems to think it a 
hard bargain, for he only lets it play about half an 
hour a day. But he says it's very ingeniously 
mended. He didn 't believe it could be done. It 
is pretty. 

" It is, indeed," said the painter, with a singular 
desire, going through him like a pang, likewise to 
do something for Miss Vervain. " Did you go to 
Don Ippolito's house the other day, to see his 
traps ? " 

" Yes ; we were very much interested. I was 
sorry that I knew so little about inventions. Do 
you think there are many practical ideas amongst 
his things ? I hope there are he seemed so proud 
and pleased to show them. shouldn 't you think 
he had some real inventive talent ? " 

" Yes, I think he has ; but I know as little about 
the matter as you do." He sat down beside her, 
and picking up a twig from the gravel, pulled the 
bark off in silence. Then, " Miss Vervain," he 
said, knitting his brows, as he always did when he 
had something on his conscience and meant to ease 
it at any cost, " I'm the dog that fetches a bone 
and carries a bone ; I talked Don Ippolito over with 
you, the other day, and now I've been talking you 
over with him. But I've the grace to say that I'm 
ashamed of myself." 



 

" Why need you be ashamed ? " asked Florida. 
" You said no harm of him. Did you of us ? " 

" Not exactly ; but I don 't think it was quite my 
business to discuss you at all. I think you can 't 
let people alone too much. For my part, if I try to 
characterize my friends, I fail to do them perfect 
justice, of course ; and yet the imperfect result re 
mains representative of them in my mind ; it limits 
them and fixes them ; and I can 't get them back 
again into the undefined and the ideal where they 
really belong. One ought never to speak of the 
faults of one's friends : it mutilates them ; they can 
never be the same afterwards." 

" So you have been talking of my faults," said 
Florida, breathing quickly. " Perhaps you could 
tell me of them to my face." 

"I should have to say that unfairness was one of 
them.. But that is common to the whole sex. I 
never said I was talking of your faults. I declared 
against doing so, and you immediately infer that 
my motive is remorse. I don 't know that you have 
any faults. They may be virtues in disguise. 
There is a charm even in unfairness. Well, I did 
say that I thought you had a quick temper," 

Florida colored violently. 

"but now I see that I was mistaken," said 
Ferris with a laugh. 

" May I ask what else you said ? " demanded the 
young girl haughtily. 

"Oh, that would be a betrayal of confidence," 
said Ferris, unaffected by her hauteur. 



 

" Then why have you mentioned the matter to 
me at all ? " 

" I wanted to clear my conscience, I suppose, 
and sin again. I wanted to talk with you about 
P m Ippolito." 

Florida looked with perplexity at Ferris's face, 
while her own slowly cooled and paled. 

" What did you want to say of him ? " she asked 
calmly. 

" I hardly know how to put it : that he puzzles 
me, to begin with. You know I feel somewhat re 
sponsible for him." 

" Yes." 

" Of course, I never should have thought of him, 
if it had n t been for your mother's talk that morn 
ing coming back from San Lazzaro." 

" I know," said Florida, with a faint blush. 

" And yet, don 't you see, it was as much a fancy 
of mine, a weakness for the man himself, as the de 
sire to serve your mother, that prompted me to 
bring him to you." 

" Yes, I see," answered the young girl. 

" I acted in the teeth of a bitter Venetian preju 
dice against priests. All my friends here they re 
mostly young men with the modern Italian ideas, 
or old liberals hate and despise the priests. 
They believe that priests are full of guile and de 
ceit, that they are spies for the Austrians, and al 
together evil." 

" Don Ippolito is welcome to report our most se- 



 

cret thoughts to the police," said Florida, whose 
look of rising alarm relaxed into a smile. 

" Oh," cried the painter, "how you leap to con 
clusions ! I never intimated that Don Ippolito was 
a spy. On the contrary, it was his difference from 
other priests that made me think of him for a mo 
ment. He seems to be as much cut off from the 
church as from the world. And yet he is a priest, 
with a priest's education. What if I should have 
been altogether mistaken ? He is either one of the 
openest souls in the world, as you have insisted, or 
he is one of the closest." 

" I should not be afraid of him in any case," said 
Florida; "but I can 't believe any wrong of him." 

Ferris frowned in annoyance. " I don 't want 
you to ; I don t, myself. I've bungled the matter 
as I might have known I would. I was trying to 
put into words an undefined uneasiness of mine, a 
quite formless desire to have you possessed of the 
whole case as it had come up in my mind. I've 
made a mess of it," said Ferris rising, with a rueful 
air. " Besides, I ought to have spoken to Mrs. 
Vervain." 

" Oh no," cried Florida, eagerly, springing to her 
feet beside him. " don 't ! Little things wear upon 
my mother, so. I'm glad you didn 't speak to her. 
I don 't misunderstand you, I think ; I expressed 
myself badly," she added with an anxious face. u I 
thank you very much. What do you want me to 
do?" 



lZ A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. 

By Ferris's impulse they both began to move 
down the garden path toward the water-gate. The 
sunset had faded out of the fountain, but it still lit 
the whole heaven, in whose vast blue depths hung 
light whiffs of pinkish cloud, as ethereal as the dra 
peries that floated after Miss Vervain as she walked 
with a splendid grace beside him, no awkwardness, 
now, or self-constraint in her. As she turned to 
Ferris, and asked in her deep tones, to which some 
latent feeling imparted a slight tremor, " What do 
you want me to do ? " the sense of her willingness 
to be bidden by him gave him a delicious thrill. 
He looked at the superb creature, so proud, so help 
less ; so much a woman, so much a child ; and he 
caught his breath before he answered. Her gauzes 
blew about his feet in the light breeze that lifted 
the foliage ; she was a little near-sighted, and in 
her eagerness she drew closer to him, fixing her 
eyes full upon his with a bold innocence. " Good 
heavens ! Miss Vervain," he cried, with a sudden 
blush, " it isn 't  a serious matter. I'm a fool to 
have spoken to you. don 't do anything. Let 
things go on as before. It isn 't  for me to instruct 
you." 

" I should have been very glad of your advice," 
she said with a disappointed, almost wounded man 
ner, keeping her eyes upon him. u It seems to me 
we are always going wrong " 

She stopped short, with a flush and then a pallor. 

Ferris returned her look with one of comical dis- 



 

may. This apparent readiness of Miss Vervain's 
to be taken command of, daunted him, on second 
thoughts. u I wish you d dismiss all my stupid 
talk from your mind," he said. u I feel as if T d 
been guiltily trying to set you against a man whom 
I like very much and have no reason not to trust, 
and who thinks me so much his friend that he 
couldn t dream of my making any sort of trouble 
for him. It would break his heart, I'm afraid, if 
you treated him in a different way from that in 
which you've treated him till now. It's really 
touching to listen to his gratitude to you and your 
mother. It's only conceivable on the ground that 
he has never had friends before in the world. He 
seems like another man, or the same man come to 
life. And it isn 't  his fault that he's a priest. I 
suppose," he added, with a sort of final throe, 
"that a Venetian family wouldn 't use him with 
the frank hospitality you've shown, not because 
they distrusted him at all, perhaps, but because 
they would be afraid of other Venetian tongues." 

This ultimate drop of venom, helplessly distilled, 
did not seem to rankle in Miss Vervain's mind. 
She walked now with her face turned from his, and 
she answered coldly, " We shall not be troubled. 
We don 't care for Venetian tongues." 

They were at the gate. " Good-by," said Ferris, 
abruptly, " I'm going." 

" won 't you wait and see my mother ? " asked 
Florida, with her awkward self-constraint again 
upon her. 



 

tk No, thanks," said Ferris, gloomily. " I haven 't 
time. I just dropped in for a moment, to blast an 
innocent man's reputation, and destroy a young 
lady's peace of mind." 

" Then you needn 't go, yet," answered Florida, 
coldly, " for you haven 't succeeded." 

" Well, I've done my worst," returned Ferris, 
drawing the bolt. 

He went away, hanging his head in amazement 
and disgust at himself for his clumsiness and bad 
taste. . It seemed to him a contemptible part, first 
to embarrass them with Don Ippolito's acquaint 
ance, if it was an embarrassment, and then try to 
sneak out of his responsibility by these tardy cau 
tions ; and if it was not going to be an embarrass 
ment, it was folly to have approached the matter at 
all. 

What had he wanted to do, and with what mo 
tive ? He hardly knew. As he battled the ground 
over and over again, nothing comforted him save 
the thought that, bad as it was to have spoken to 
Miss Vervain, it must have been infinitely worse to 
speak to her mother. 



VIII. 

IT was late before Ferris forgot Ms chagrin in 
sleep, and when he woke the next morning, the sun 
was making the solid green blinds at his window 
odorous of their native pine woods with its heat, 
and thrusting a golden spear at the heart of Don 
Ippolito's effigy where he had left it on the easel. 

Marina brought a letter with his coffee. The 
letter was from Mrs. Vervain, and it entreated him 
to come to lunch at twelve, and then join them on 
an excursion, of which they had all often talked, up 
the Canal of the Brenta. " Don Ippolito has got 
his permission think of his not being able to go 
to the mainland without the Patriarch's leave ! and 
can go with us to-day. So I try to make this hasty 
arrangement. You must come it all depends 
upon you." 

" Yes, so it seems," groaned the painter, and 
went. 

In the garden he found Don Ippolito and Florida, 
at the fountain where he had himself parted with 
her the evening before ; and he observed with a 
guilty relief that Don Ippolito was talking to her 
in the happy unconsciousness habitual with him. 

Florida cast at the painter a swift glance of latent 
appeal and intelligence, which he refused, and in 



 

the same instant she met him with another look, as 
if she now saw him for the first time, and gave him 
her hand in greeting. It was a beautiful hand ; 
he could not help worshipping its lovely forms, and 
the lily whiteness and softness of the back, the rose 
of the palm and finger-tips. 

She idly resumed the great Venetian fan which 
hung from her waist by a chain. " Don Ippolito 
has been talking about the villeggiatura on the 
Brenta in the old days," she explained. 

" Oh, yes," said the painter, " they used to have 
merry times in .the villas then, and it was worth 
while being a priest, or at least an ablate di casa. 
I should think you would sigh for a return of those 
good old days, Don Ippolito. Just imagine, if you 
were abbate di casa with some patrician family 
about the close of the last century, you might be the 
instructor, companion, and spiritual adviser of Illus- 
trissima at the theatres, card-parties, and masquer 
ades, all winter; and at this season, instead of go 
ing up the Brenta for a day's pleasure with us 
barbarous Yankees, you might be setting out with 
Illustrissima and all the c Strissimi and Strissime, 
big and little, for a spring villeggiatura there. You 
would be going in a gilded barge, with songs and 
fiddles and dancing, instead of a common gondola, 
and you would stay a month, walking, going to 
parties and caffes, drinking chocolate and lemonade, 
gaming, sonneteering, and butterflying about gen 
erally." 



 

" It was doubtless a beautiful life," answered 
the priest, with simple indifference. " But I never 
have thought of it with regret, because I have been 
preoccupied with other ideas than those of social 
pleasures, though perhaps they were no wiser." 

Florida had watched Don Ippolito's face while 
Ferris was speaking, and she now asked gravely, 
" But don 't you think their life nowadays is more 
becoming to the clergy? " 

" Why, madamigella ? What harm was there 
in those gayeties ? I suppose the bad features of 
the old life are exaggerated to us." 

" They could n t have been worse than the amuse 
ments of the hard-drinking, hard-riding, hard- 
swearing, fox-hunting English parsons about the 
same time," said Ferris. " Besides, the abbate di 
casa had a charm of his own, the charm of all rococo 
things, which, whatever you may say of them, are 
somehow elegant and refined, or at least refer to 
elegance and refinement. I don 't say they re en 
nobling, but they re fascinating. I don 't respect 
them, but I love them. When I think about the 
past of Venice, I don 't care so much to see any of 
the heroically historical things ; but I should like 
immensely to have looked in at the Ridotto, when 
the place was at its gayest with wigs and masks, 
hoops and small-clothes, fans and rapiers, bows and 
courtesies, whispers and glances. I dare say I 
should have found Don Ippolito there .in some be 
coming disguise. 


Florida looked from the painter to the priest and 
back to the painter, as Ferris spoke, and then she 
turned, a little anxiously toward the terrace, and 
a shadow slipped from her face as her mother came 
rustling down the steps, catching at her drapery 
and shaking it into place. The young girl hur 
ried to meet her, lifted her arms for what promised 
an embrace, and with firm hands set the elder 
lady's bonnet straight with her forehead. 

" I'm always getting it on askew," Mrs. Ver 
vain said for greeting to Ferris. " How do you do, 
Don Ippolito ? But I suppose you think I Ve kept 
you long enough to get it on straight for once. So 
I have. I am a fuss, and I don 't deny it. At my 
time of life, it's much harder to make yourself ship 
shape than it is when you're younger. I tell Flor 
ida that anybody would take her for the old lady, 
she does seem to give so little care to getting up an 
appearance." 

" And yet she has the effect of a stylish young 
person in the bloom of youth," observed Ferris, 
with a touch of caricature. 

" We had better lunch with our things on," said 
Mrs. Vervain, " and then there needn 't be any 
delay in starting. I thought we would have it 
here," she added, as Nina and the house-servant 
appeared with trays of dishes and cups. " So that 
we can start in a real picnicky spirit. I knew 
you d think it a womanish lunch, Mr. Ferris Don 
Ippolito likes what we do and so I've provided 



 

you with a chicken salad ; and I'm going to ask 
you for a taste of it ; I'm really hungry." 

There was salad for all, in fact ; and it was quite 
one o clock before the lunch was ended, and wraps 
of just the right thickness and thinness were chosen, 
and the party were comfortably placed under the 
striped linen canopy of the gondola, which they had 
from a public station, the house-gondola being en 
gaged that day. They rowed through the narrow 
canal skirting the garden out into the expanse be 
fore the Giudecca, and then struck across the la- 
goon towards Fusina, past the island-church of San 
Giorgio in Alga, whose beautiful tower has flushed 
and darkened in so many pictures of Venetian sun 
sets, and past the Austrian lagoon forts with their 
coronets of guns threatening every point, and the 
Croatian sentinels pacing to and fro on their walls. 
They stopped long enough at one of the customs 
barges to declare to the swarthy, amiable officers 
the innocence of their freight, and at the mouth of 
the Canal of the Brenta they paused before the 
station while a policeman came out and scanned 
them. He bowed to Don Tppolito's cloth, and then 
they began to push up the sluggish canal, shallow 
and overrun with weeds and mosses, into the heart 
of the land. 

The spring, which in Venice comes in the soften 
ing air and the perpetual azure of the heavens, was 
renewed to their senses in all its miraculous loveli 
ness. The garden of the Vervains had indeed con- 



 

fessed it in opulence of leaf and bloom, but there it 
seemed somehow only like a novel effect of the arti 
fice which had been able to create a garden in that 
city of stone and sea. Here a vernal world sud 
denly opened before them, with wide-stretching 
fields of green under a dome of perfect blue ; 
against its walls only the soft curves of far-off hills 
were traced, and near at hand the tender forms of 
full-foliaged trees. The long garland of vines that 
festoons all Italy seemed to begin in the neighbor 
ing orchards ; the meadows waved their tall grasses 
in the sun, and broke in poppies as the sea- waves 
break in iridescent spray ; the well-grown maize 
shook its gleaming blades in the light ; the poplars 
marched in stately procession on either side of the 
straight, white road to Padua, till they vanished 
in the long perspective. The blossoms had fallen 
from the trees many weeks before, but the air was 
full of the vague sweetness of the perfect spring, 
which here and there gathered and defined itself as 
the spicy odor of the grass cut on the shore of the 
canal, and drying in the mellow heat of the sun. 

The voyagers spoke from time to time of some 
peculiarity of the villas that succeeded each other 
along the canal. Don Ippolito knew a few of them, 
the gondoliers knew others ; but after all, their 
names were nothing. These haunts of old-time 
splendor and idleness weary of themselves, and un 
able to escape, are sadder than anything in Venice, 
and they belonged, as far as the Americans were 



 

concerned, to a, world as strange as any to which 
they should go in another life, the world of a 
faded fashion and an alien history. Some of the 
villas were kept in a sort of repair ; some were even 
maintained in the state of old ; but the most showed 
marks of greater or less decay, and here and there 
one was falling to ruin. They had gardens about 
them, tangled and wild-grown ; a population of de 
crepit statues in the rococo taste strolled in their 
walks or simpered from their gates. Two or three 
houses seemed to be occupied ; the rest stood 
empty, each 

" Close latticed to the brooding heat, 
And silent in its dusty vines." 

The pleasure-party had no fixed plan for the day 
further than to ascend the canal, and by and by 
take a carriage at some convenient village and 
drive to the famous Villa Pisani at Stra. 

" These houses are very well," said Don Ippolito, 
who had visited the villa once, and with whom it 
had remained a memory almost as signal as that 
night in Padua when he wore civil dress, but it is 
at Stra that you see something really worthy of the 
royal splendor of the patricians of Venice. Royal ? 
The villa is now one of the palaces of the ex- 
Emperor of Austria, who does not find it less im 
perial than his other palaces." Don Ippolito had 
celebrated the villa at Stra in this strain ever since 
they had spoken of going up the Brenta : now it 
was the magnificent conservatories and orangeries 



 

that he sang, now the vast garden with its statued 
walks between rows of dipt cedars and firs, now 
the stables with their stalls for numberless horses, 
now the palace itself with its frescoed halls and 
treasures of art and vertu. His enthusiasm for the 
villa at Stra had become an amiable jest with the 
Americans. Ferris laughed at his fresh outburst ; 
he declared himself tired of the gondola, and he 
asked Florida to disembark with him and walk 
under the trees of a pleasant street running on one 
side between the villas and the canal. " We are 
going to find something much grander than the 
Villa Pisani," he boasted, with a look at Don Ippo- 
lito. 

As they sauntered along the path together, they 
came now and then to a stately palace like that of 
the Contarini, where the lions, that give their name 
to one branch of the family, crouch in stone before 
the grand portal ; but most of the houses were in 
teresting only from their u listened possibilities to 
the imagination. They were generally of stucco, 
and glared with fresh whitewash through the foli 
age of their gardens. When a peasant's cottage 
broke their line, it gave, with its barns and straw- 
stacks and its beds of pot-herbs, a homely relief 
from the decaying gentility of the villas. 

" What a pity, Miss Vervain," said the painter, 
" that the blessings of this world should be so un 
equally divided ! Why should all this sketchable 
adversity be lavished upon the neighborhood of a 



 

city that is so rich as Venice in picturesque dilapi 
dation ? It's pretty hard on us Americans, and 
forces people of sensibility into exile. What 
wouldn 't cultivated persons give for a stretch of 
this street in the suburbs of Boston, or of your own 
Providence ? I suppose the New Yorkers will be 
setting up something of the kind one of these days, 
and giving it a French name they'll call it Aux 
lords du Brenta. There was one of them carried 
back a gondola the other day to put on a pond in 
their new park. But the worst of it is, you can 't 
take home the sentiment of these things." 

" I thought it was the business of painters to 
send home the sentiment of them in pictures, I said 
Florida. 

Ferris talked to her in this way because it was 
his way of talking ; it always surprised him a little 
that she entered into the spirit of it ; he was not 
quite sure that she did ; he sometimes thought she 
waited till she could seize upon a point to turn 
against him, and so give herself the air of having 
comprehended the whole. He laughed : " Oh yes, 
a poor little fragmentary, faded-out reproduction of 
their sentiment which is as moonlight unto sun 
light and as water unto wine, when compared with 
the real thing. Suppose I made a picture of this 
very bit, ourselves in the foreground, looking at the 
garden over there where that amusing Vandal of an 
owner has just had his statues painted white : would 
our friends at home understand it ? A whole his- 



 

tory must be left unexpressed. I could only hint at 
an entire situation. Of course, people with a taste 
for olives would get the flavor ; but even they would 
wonder that I chose such an unsuggestive bit. Why, 
it is just the most maddeningly suggestive thing to 
be found here ! And if I may put it modestly, for 
my share in it, I think we t\vo young Americans 
looking on at this supreme excess of the rococo, are 
the very essence of the sentiment of the scene ; but 
what would the honored connoisseurs the good 
folks who get themselves up on Ruskin and try so 
honestly hard to have some little ideas about art 
make of us ? To be sure they might justifiably 
praise the grace of your pose, if I were so lucky as 
to catch it, and your way of putting your hand 
under the elbow of the arm that holds your para 
sol," Florida seemed disdainfully to keep her 
attitude, and the painter smiled, " but they 
would n t know what it all meant, and could n t 
imagine that we were inspired by this rascally little 
villa to sigh longingly over the wicked past." .... 

" Excuse me," interrupted Florida, with a touch 
of trouble in her proud manner, " I'm not sighing 
over it, for one, and I don 't want it back. I'm glad 
that I' mAmerican and that there is no past for me. 
I can 't understand how you and Don Ippolito can 
speak so tolerantly of what no one can respect," 
she added, in almost an aggrieved tone. 

If Miss Vervain wanted to turn the talk upon 
Don Ippolito, Ferris by no means did ; he had had 



 

enough of that subject yesterday ; he got as lightly 
away from it as he could. 

" Oh, Don Ippolito's a pagan, I tell you ; and 
I'm a painter, and the rococo is my weakness. I 
wish I could paint it, but I can 't ; I'm a hundred 
years too late. I could n t even paint myself in the 
act of sentimentalizing it." 

While he talked, he had been making a few lines 
in a small pocket sketch-book, with a furtive glance 
or two at Florida. When they returned to the 
boat, lie busied himself again with the book, and 
presently he handed it to Mrs. Vervain. 

Why, it's Florida!" cried the lady; How 
very nicely you do sketch, Mr. Ferris." 

"Thanks, Mrs. Vervain; you're always flatter 
ing me." 

" No, but seriously. I wish that I had paid more 
attention to my drawing when I was a girl. And 
now, Florida she won 't touch a pencil. I wish 
you d talk to her, Mr. Ferris." 

" Oh, people who are pictures needn 't trouble 
themselves to be painters," said Ferris, with a little 
burlesque. 

Mrs. Vervain began to look at the sketch through 
her tubed hand; the painter made a grimace.
