 

as it ought to be, not as it is, and it is no plan of theirs 
to read books or witness plays that might carve and 
populate a new groove in their brains. 

Let no one imagine that this class will become more 
"enlightened," "broader," as time goes on. Not for a 
century at least. Mind has made too great a success of 
this product ; she has practically achieved a complete triumph over the lady at the wheel. It is this class that 
has made civilization, progress, the solid thing it is to 
date. The excrescences, the deserters from the normal, 
scintillating or subtle, may be tolerated for the spice they 
give to life but they will never rule. 

Possibly they do not mind. Life is made up of compromises and compensations. 





American women in youth, of the visibly reputable 
world, may be freely divided into two classes, the over
-sexed and those that seem cold to themselves and others 
 until they are well into the period of their second youth 
— between twenty -four and thirty ; and a not inconsiderable number are so and permanently. In the first ease 
they either precipitate themselves into matrimony or 
have one or more intrigues until they find the man they 
wish to marry, when they settle down and make excellent wives. The others, if they are imaginative and high- 
minded, fall in love romantically and marry far too 
soon ; or they capitalize their youth or beauty and marry 
to the best advantage ; or they elect to live a life of serene 
spinsterhood like Alexina's Aunt Clara, and bring up the 
family children. A not inconsiderable number take their 
fling late. 

When the American girl of the super-refined class, and 
whose baleful norm in the crypt was asleep at the wheel 
in her first blind youth, finds herself disappointed in the 
most intimate partnership that exists, the complaisance, 
voluntary at the beginning, drifts into habit, more and 
more grimly endured. Some have the moral courage to 
put an end to it as they would to any false situation, 
/but if individuals were not rare in this world we should 



 

have chaos, not a civilization of sorts which is a pleasant 
place to plant the feet, however high into the clouds the 
head may poke its investigating nose. 

It is natural that with such women during the period 
of endurance all love should seem distasteful, and the 
mind dwell upon any other subject. But remove the 
cause of sex-inertia and there is likely to be the stir and 
awakening of spring after a long monotonous winter of 
hard frost and blanketing snow. Or a homelier simile: 
remove the cause of chronic indigestion and the appetite 
becomes fresh and normal. 

Thus Alexitia. 



CHAPTER "VI 



CAN FRANCISCO, commencing in September, has 
 three or four months of perfect weather. The cold 
fogs and winds cease to pay their daily visits, the rainy 
season awaits the new year. The skies are a deep and 
cloudless blue, the air is warm and soft and alluring, 
never too hot, although the overcoats of summer are discarded. 

The city lies bathed in golden sunlight or the sharp 
jeweled light of stars, when the moon is not blazing like 
a crystal bonfire. Then Mount Tamalpais and other 
mountains across the Bay and behind the city take on 
a chiseled outline that, particularly at night, makes them 
look curiously new, as if but yesterday heaved from the 
deep, and Nature too busy to provide them with a back- 
ground and the soft blurs of time for centuries to come. 
This primeval look of bare California mountains on clear 
nights has something sinister and menacing in its aspect 
as if at any moment they might once more brood alone 
over the earth. 



Alexina returned from abroad early in November and 
stood one morning outside her eucalyptus grove, revolving slowly on one heel, schoolgirl fashion, as she gazed 
up at the steep densely populated hUl that rose from 
the street below her own private little hill, and cut off 
her view of the hills of Berkeley and the mountains beyond; at the broad crowded valleys on the south; the 
range of hills that hid the Pacific Ocean, and included 
Mount Calvary with its cross and the symmetrical mass 
of Twin Peaks; the bare brown mountains of the north 
piling above the green sparkling bay with its wooded 
and military islands. 

Like a good and valiant Californian she was assuring 
herself that she had seen nothing like this in Europe, 
and that she really preferred it to art galleries and dilapidated old ruins. But as a matter of fact she had 
returned to California with dragging feet and was 
merely staving off the disheartening moment when her 
ruthless candor would force her to admit it. 

San Praneiseo was all very weU, and in this dazzling 
light that compact mass of houses swarming over the 
city's hills and valleys, with sudden palms in high gardens and a tree here and there, produced the impression 
that all were white with red roofs, and looked not unlike 
Genoa. But it seemed quite unromantie and uninspir- 
ing to a girl who had just paid her first brief visit to 
the old world, an interval, moreover, that had been without a responsibility, cut her off so completely from her 
general life that when variously addressed "Mademoi- 
selle," "Signorina," "Seiiorita," she ceased almost at 
once to feel either surprised or flattered. If she had not 
forbidden herself to dream she would stni have been 
Alexina Groome with a future to sketch with her own 
adventurous pencil ; and to fill in at her pleasure. 

But although she was free in a sense she was not free 
to live in Europe. She was a partner with a partner's 
obligations. To desert Mortimer would not only be to 
banish him from Ballinger House to dreary bachelor 
quarters, with none of the comforts and little luxuries 
he intensely loved, but it would also deprive him of his 
surest social prop. People had accepted him and liked 
him as well as they liked the totally uninteresting of 
the good old stock ; but many would drift into the habit 



 

of not inviting him to anything but large dances, if his 
wife were absent. Alexina knew that her invitations to 
all important and many small dinners, not avowedly 
bridge or poker parties, were as inevitable as crab in 
season ; but there were too many young men whom girls 
would infinitely prefer to enliven the monotony of crab 
a la poulette, to any married man, particularly one who 
had as little to say as poor Morty. She had known 
debutantes who flatly refused to dance with married men 
or even to be introduced to them. 

California was her fate. No doubt of that. She might 
never see Europe again, for while it was all very well to 
be a guest once it would be quite impossible another time. 
She certainly could not afford it herself and keep Ballinger House open, even for brief summer visits ; as she 
might if her home were in New York. 

Of course Mortimer might make his million, but then 
cigaii; he might not. Certainly there were no present 
signs of it and she had never seen him so depressed, not 
even during the panic of nineteen-seven. His eyes were 
as lifeless as slate, his voice was flat, although for that 
matter he was almost dumb. When at home he sat 
brooding heavily by the open western windows of the 
drawing-room, or moved restlessly about. To all her 
questions he replied shortly that the times were 
bad again, worse than ever; that he was holding 
his own, but was tired, tired, out. As she had 
not been there he had not cared to take a cottage 
by himself, and had paid few week-end visits. He had 
nothing to talk to women about and the men talked of 
nothing but the business depression. . . . Alexina had 
shrugged her shoulders and concluded that his attitude 
was a subtle reproach for leaving him to the dull cares 
of business while she enjoyed herself in Europe. 

She was not in the least sorry for Mortimer. He had 
been perfectly comfortable ; he had had his friends ; she 
had left him a sum of money which with the monthly 
rents from the flats would pay her share in the household 
expenses ; he could spend his free afternoons at the golf 
club by the ocean, and his evenings, when not invited 
out, at the temple of his idolatry on Nob Hill. James 




was a better housekeeper than she was and it was now 
two years that Mortimer had been living the life of a 
luxurious bachelor at the back of the house with an always amiable companion at breakfast and dinner. 





Alexina, as she stood shading her eyes from the brilliant sunlight and watching a great liner drift through 
the Golden Gate, wondered if Morty had consoled hisself, and if his Puritanical conscience were flaying him. 
She hoped that he had, for she was quite willing that he 
should be happy in his own way, poor thing, so long as 
he secluded his divagations from the world — and she 
could trust him to do that ! Now that she had ceased to be 
the complaisant bored wife with dull nerves and torpid 
imagination she would be the last to condemn him. Hu- 
man Nature was an ever opening book to her these days, 
and she wondered what would happen to herself if any 
of several men she liked were capable of making her love 
him, whipping up a personal storm in those emotional 
gulfs which had slowly and inflexibly intruded themselves upon her consciousness. 

She had pondered long and deeply on this subject, particularly in the old world where bonds seem looser to 
the mere observer whether they are or not, and where 
life looks to the American the quintessence of romance. 
. . . She had concluded that the most satisfactory experience that could come to her would be a mad love affair 
"in the air" with a man who possessed all the requirements to induce it, but who would either be the unsuspecting object, or, reciprocating, would continue to love 
her with the world between them. 

For she shrank from the disillusionments of secret 
libertinage; she did not, indeed, believe that love could 
survive it, although passion might for a time. Passion 
was unthinkable to her without love, and when she recalled the mean and sordid devices to which two of her 
friends were put to to meet their lovers she felt nothing 
but disgust for the whole drama of man and woman. 

Alexina had been reared on the soundest moral principles of church and society, to say nothing of the law, 
but the norm at the wheel has often laughed in her amiable way at church and society and law when circumstances have conspired to help her. But against fastidiousness even the blind urge of the race seldom has 
availed her ; she can only go on sullenly feeding the fires, 
heaping on the fuel, hoping grimly for the astrological 
moment. 

IV 

Alexina shrugged her shoulders impatiently and went 
into the house. She would go down to the bank and 
clip her coupons. She cultivated assiduously the practical side of life, making the most of it, delighted when 
repairs were needed on her flats, regretting that the 
greater part of her income came from ground rents, collected, as ever, by Tom Abbott, and bonds, from which 
she still experienced a childish pleasure in cutting the 
coupons. Her flats, which were in a humbler part of the 
western division of the city, she had never visited, 
but she received a call every month from the agent, who 
brought her the rents and complaints. 

She had made a heroic effort to turn herself into a 
business woman but the material had been too slender; 
and she sometimes wished for a large independent fortune that would tax her powers to the utmost. But she 
never even had any surplus to invest. Her wardrobe 
was no inconsiderable item; living prices rose steadily; 
there were repairs both on her own house and the flats 
to be anticipated every year, to say nothing of the flendish sum that must be set aside for taxes. But she managed to save the necessary amount; and if they lived 
somewhat extravagantly, at least she had never disturbed her capital. 

On the whole she knew they had managed very well for 
young people who lived so much in the world, and she 
had no intention of economizing further. They had no 
children. Her husband was young and energetic and 
healthy. Her own little fortune was secure. She purposed to enjoy life as best she could; and as she could 
not have done this quite selfishly and been happy, she ineluded among her yearly expenditures a certain admirable charity presided over by her equally admirable sister, 
and even visited it occasionally with her friends when a 
serious mood descended abruptly upon them. . . . She 
was now on the threshold of her second beautiful youth, 
and found herself and life far more interesting than 
when, a silly girl of eighteen, she had believed that all 
life and romance must be crowded into that callow period. She had no idea of sacrificing this new era vibrating with unknown possibilities (it was on the cards that 
she might resurrect Gathbroke from his ivory tomb; he 
would do admirably for her present needs, and when she 
found it difficult to visualize him after so long a period, 
she could pay Gora a sisterly visit) to a penurious attempt to increase her capital. At the same time she had 
no intention of diminishing it. To quote Tom Abbott 
(when Maria was elsewhere) : She might be a fool, or 
even a fool, but she was not a fool. 



She dressed herself in a black velvet suit made by her 
NeW York tailors. She had spent a fortnight with her 
brother Ballinger on her way home, and he had given her 
a set of silver fox: a large muff and two of those priceless animals head to head to keep a small section of her 
anatomy at blood heat in a climate never cold enough for 
furs. 

The day was hot. It was the sort of weather which 
on the opposite side of the continent arrives when spring 
is melting into summer and fortunate woman arrays herself in thin and dainty fabrics. But women everywhere 
with a proper regard for fashion rush the season, and 
autumn is the time to display the first smart habiliments 
of winter. No San Francisco woman of fashion would 
be guilty of comfortable garments in the glorious spring 
weather of November if she perished in her furs. 

The coat, bound with silk braid, was lined with periwinkle blue, and there was a touch of the same color in 
her large black velvet hat. Nothing could make the 
great irises of her black-gray eyes look blue, but they 



 

shone out, dazzling, under the drooping brim; and if 
she was, perchance, too warm above, her scant skirt, her 
thin silk stockings and low patent leather shoes struck 
the balance like a brilliant paradox. 

Alexina nodded approvingly at her image in the pier 
glass, found the key of her safe deposit box in the cabinet 
where she had left it, and went down to the smart little 
electric car which the gardener had brought to the door. 



CHAPTER VI 



ALEXINA stood alone in the strong room of the 
 bank leaning heavily against the wall with its endless rows of compartments from one of which she had 
taken the dispatch box in which she had kept her bonds. 

The box had fallen to the floor. If there had been 
any one in the room with her he would have started and 
turned as the box clanged with a hollow echo on the 
steel surface. 

The box was empty. 

It was a large box. It had contained forty thousand 
dollars' worth of bonds, nearly a third of her fortune. 
The securities were among the soundest the country 
afforded, for Alexander Groome, wild as he may have 
been when relieving the monotony of life with too many 
diversions, not the least of which was speculation, never 
made a mistake in his permanent investments ; and others 
had been bought with equal prudence by Judge Lawton 
or Tom Abbott. 

But the bonds had been negotiable. She recalled Tom 
Abbott's warning to keep them always in her safe deposit box and the key hidden. They might be traced if 
stolen, but State's Prison for the thief would be cold 
comfort if the bonds had been cashed and the money 
spent. 

She had always had one of the lighter Italian pieces 
in her bedroom, a beautiful cabinet of carved and gilded 



 

oak nearly black with age. Like all such it had a secret 
drawer and here she had kept her keys, and her jewels 
during the winter. 

Who knew of this secret drawer, which opened by 
pressing a certain little gilded face on the panel? . . . 
All her friends, of course: Aileen, Sibyl, Alice, Olive, 
Janet, Helene. . . . Unthinkable to have a secret drawer 
in an old Italian cabinet which had belonged to some 
Borgia or other, and not exhibit it to one's chosen friends. 

She had even shown it to Gora, but to no one else but 
Mortimer. She had kept his love letters in it for a time, 
written while the family was applying the polite methods 
of the modern inquisition at Kincona. They had remained there, forgotten, until her mother's death, when 
she had remembered the secret drawer as a safe hiding 
place for her keys and jewels ; which, with her mother's, 
had formerly reposed in the safe under the stairs. 

It was a deep drawer and when she was in town held 
the few valuable stones, reset, that she had inherited 
from her mother, besides the tine pieces she had received 
as wedding-gifts ; when all the old friends of the family 
out-did themselves, and not a few of the less distinguished but more opulent, whose tloora Alexina had 
graced while her mother slept. Her pearl necklace had 
been the present of her more intimate group of friends. 

Alexina was not a little proud of her collection of 
jewels, although she seldom wore anything but her 
pearls. She had left it when she went abroad, in the 
safe deposit vault, and she sent a quick terrified glance 
in the coffer's direction like that of a cornered rat. 

But her attention riveted itself once more on the empty 
box at her feet. A third of her fortune, and gone beyond redemption. Her stunned mind grasped that fact 
at once. No one stole bonds to keep them. But who was 
the thief? 

Not any of her old friends. They might gamble, or 
drink, or deceive their legal guardians, but they drew 
the line at stealing. Certain sins lie within the social 
code and others do not. Women of her class, unless 
kleptomaniac, did not steal. It wasn't done. With reason or unreason they classed thieves of any sort with harlots, burglars, firebugs, embezzlers, forgers, murderers, 
and common people who overdressed and drank too mucli 
in public ; and withdrew their skirts. 

Moreover, Aileen had been with her in Europe. Olive 
lived there. Janet and Sibyl had more money than they 
could spend. The Euylers were ranching, and Helen! 
was in Adler's Sanatorium with a new baby. Alice had 
gone to Santa Barbara before she left and had not returned. 

It was insulting even to pass them in review, but the 
mind works in erratic curves under shock. 

Gora had taken the thousand dollars Mortimer had 
returned to her and gone first to Lake Tahoe and then 
to Honolulu to write a novel. She would return on the 
morrow. 

Mortimer. 

It was incredible. Monstrous. She was outrageous 
even to link his name with such a deed. He was the 
soul of honor. He might not be a genius but no man 
had a cleaner reputation. She had lived with him now 
for over six years and she had never . . . never . . . 
never . . . 

And she knew, unconsentingly, infallibly, that Mortimer had stolen the bonds. 



CHAPTER VII 



A LEXINA drew the jewel coffer from the depths of 
'* the compartment and opened it with fingers that 
felt swollen and numb. But the jewels were there, and 
she experienced a feeling of fleeting satisfaction. They 
were no part of her fortune, for she believed that only 
want would ever induce her to sell them, but at least 
they were her own personal treasure and a part of the 
beauty of life. 

She returned the fallen box to its place and locked 
the little cupboard, then took herself in hand. Neither 



 

the keeper outside the door of the vault nor those she met 
above must suspect that anything was wrong with her. 
What she should do she had no idea at the moment, but 
at all events she must have time to think. 

She left the bank with her usual light step and her 
Sead high, and then she motored down the Peninsula. 
As she passed the shipyards she saw crowds of men 
standing about; some of them turned and scowled after 
her. They were on strike and took her no doubt for the 
wife or daughter of a millionaire ; and in truth there 
was never any difference superficially in her appearance 
from that of her wealthier friends. She had one ear instead of several but it was perfect of its kind. Her 
wardrobe was by no means as extensive as Sibyl's or 
Janet's or a hundred others, but what she had came from 
the best houses, that use only the costhest materials. Her 
face was composed and proud. There was not a signal 
out, even from her brilliant expressive eyes, of the storm 
within. 

Her mind was no longer stunned. It was seething 
with disgust and fury. How dared he? Her own, her 
exclusive property, inherited and separate. . . . She felt 
at this moment exactly as she would have felt if her jewel 
coffer instead of the dispatch box had been rifled ; it was 
the instinct of possession that had been outraged. What 
was hers was hers as much as the hair on her head or 
the thoughts in her mind ... an instinct that harked 
back to the oldest of the buried civilizations . . . she 
wondered if any socialist really had cultivated the power 
to feel differently. She was quite certain that if Kirkpatrick should see a thief fleeing with his purse he would 
chase him, collar him, and either chastise him then and 
there or drag him to the nearest police station. 

And the thief was her husband, the man of her choice. 
Alexina felt that possibly if a brother had stolen her 
money she would have been less bitter because less humiliated; one did not select one's brothers. . . . And if 
she had still loved Mortimer it would have been bad 
enough, although no doubt with the blindness of youthful 
passion she would immediately have begun to make excuses for him, reeling a blow as it would have been. But 



 

the one compensation she had found in her matrimonial 
wilderness was her pride in the essential honor of her 
chosen partner, and her complete trust. If there had 
been any necessity for giving a power of attorney when 
she went to Europe she would have drawn it in his favor 
without hesitation, so completely had she forgotten her 
earlier incitements tq precaution. ... If she had, no 
doubt she would have returned to find herself penniless. 

Whether he had stolen the money to speculate with or 
to extricate himself from some business muddle she did 
not pause to wonder. He had lost it; that was sufficiently evident from his depression. When his powers 
of bluff failed him matters were serious indeed. 

He had stolen and lost. The first would have been 
unforgivable but the last was unpardonable. 

And he had taken her money as he would have taken 
Gora 's, or his parents ' had they been alive, because however they might lash him with their contempt, his body 
was safe from prison, his precious position in society 
unshaken. She knew him well enough to be sure that if 
he had had forty thousand dollars of some outsider's 
money under his hand it would have been safe no matter 
what his predicament. He would have accepted the 
alternative of bankruptcy without hesitation. 

But with the women of his family a man was always 
safe. She remembered something that Gora had once 
said to the same effect. . . . Yes, she could have for- 
given the theft of an outsider, for at least she would be 
spared this sickening suffocating sensation of contempt. 
It was demoralizing. She hated herself as much as she 
hated him. Moreover there would have been some compensation in sending an outsider to San Quentin. 

And there was the serious problem of readjusting her 
life. Two thousand dollars out of a small income was a 
serious deficit. Simultaneously she was visited by another horrid thought. Mortimer had heretofore paid 
half the household expenses. No doubt he was no longer 
in a position to pay any. They would have to live, keep 
up Ballinger House, dress, pay taxes, subscribe to charities, maintain their position in society, pay the doctor 
and the dentist ... a hundred and one other incidentals 



 



. . . out of four thousand dollars a year. "Well, it 
couldn't be done. They would have to change their 
mode of living. 

However, that concerned her little at present. The 
ordeal loomed of a plain talk with Mortimer. It was 
impossible to ignore the theft even had she wished ; which 
she did not, for it was her disposition to have things out 
and over with. But it would be horrible . . . horribly 
intimate. She had always deliberately lived on the surface with her family and friends, respected their privacies as she held hers inviolate. As her mind flashed 
back over her life she realized that this would be the 
first really serious personal talk she would ever have 
held nith any one. Or, it her family, and occasionally, 
Mortimer, had insisted upon being serious she had maintained her own attitude of airy humor or delicate insolence. 

She had no shyness of manner but a deep and intense 
shyness of the soul. Some day . . . perhaps . . . but 
never yet. 



She turned her ear after a time, for she feared that 
her batteries would run down. The strikers were still 
lounging and scowling ; and this time having relaxed her 
mental girths she looked at them with sympathy. She 
knew from the liberal education she had received at the 
hands of Jlr. James Kirkpatrick, and the admissions of 
Judge Lawton and other thoughtful men, that the iniquities of employers and labor were pretty equally divided ; 
greed and lack of tact on the one hand, greed and class 
hatred and the itch for power on the part of labor 
leaders; and a stupidity in the mass that was more 
pardonable than the short-sighted stupidities of capital. 
. . . But what would you? A few centuries hence the 
world might be civilized, but not in her time. Nothing 
gave her mind less exercise. One thing at least was 
certain and that was that when strikes lasted too long 
the laborers and their families went hungry, and the 
employers did not. That settled the question for her 



 

and determined the course of her sympathy. (It weis 
not yet the fashion to recognize the unfortunate 
' ' public, ' ' squeezed and helpless between these two louder 
demonstrators of sheer human nature.) 

But her mind did not linger iu the shipyards. She 
had problems of her own. . . . The chief of her compensations, having made a mess of her life, had been 
taken from her : her pride and her faith in the man to 
whom she was bound. The death of love had been so 
gradual that she had not noticed it in time for decent 
obsequies; she had not sent a regret in its wake. . . . 
She had had enough left, more than many women who 
had made the same blind plunge into the barbed wire 
maze of matrimony. . . . And now she had nothing. 
She would have liked to drive right out on to a liner 
about to sail through the Golden Gate . . . but she 
would no doubt have to live on . . . and on ... in 
changed, possibly humble, conditions . . . despising the 
man she must meet sometime every day. . . . Yes, she 
did wish she never had been bom. 



CHAPTBE VIII 



OHB concluded, while she dressed for dinner, that she 
 must be a coward. 

Alexina was far from satisfied with herself as she 
was; she would have liked to possess a great talent like 
Gora, or be an intellectual power in the world of some 
sort. She was far from stultification by the national 
gift of complacence, careless self-satisfaction — racial 
rather than individual . . . qualities that have made the 
United States lag far behind the greater European nations in all but material development and a certain 
inventiveness ; both of which in some cases are outclassed 
in the older world. 

A California woman of her mother's generation had 
become a great and renowned archaeologist and lived 



 

romantically in a castle in the City of Mexico. Slie had 
often wished, since her serious mental life had begun, 
that this gift had descended upon her — the donee had 
also been a member of the A. A., and this striking endowment might just as well have tarried a generation 
and a half longer. 

She was by no means avid of publicity — people seldom 
are until they have tasted of it — but she would have 
enjoyed a rapid and brilliant development of her mental 
faculties with productiveness of some sort either as a 
sequel or an interim. It was impossible to advance much 
farther in her present circumstances. 

No, she was far from perfect, and willing 'm admit it ; 
but she had always assumed that courage, moral as well 
as physical, was an accompaniment of race, like breeding and certain automatic impulses. But her hands were 
trembling and her cheeks drained of every drop of color 
because she must have a plain and serious talk with a 
guilty wretch. She had nothing to fear, but she could 
not have felt worse if she had been the culprit herself. 
What was human nature but a bundle of paradoxes? 

At least she had the respite of the dinner hour. Only 
a fiend would spoil a man 's dinner — and cigar — no matter what he had done. That would make the full time of 
her own respite about an hour and twenty minutes. 

In a moment of panic she contemplated telephoning 
to Aileen and begging her to come over to dinner. She 
also no doubt could get Bascom Luning and Jimmie 
Thorne. Then it would not be possible to speak to 
Mortimer before to-morrow as he always fell asleep at 
ten o'clock when there was no dancing. . . . To-morrow 
it would be easier, and wiser. One should never speak 
in anger. . . . 

But she was quite aware that her anger had burnt 
itself out. Her mind felt as cold as her hands. Better 
have it over. She put on a severe black frock, not only 
suitable to the occasion but as a protection from disarming compliments. Mortimer, who dressed so well himself 
that it would Kave been as impossible for him to over-
dress as to be rude to a woman, disliked dark severity 
in woman's attire. He never criticized his wife's clothes, 



 

but -when they displeased him he ignored them with 
delicate ostentation. 



Alexins had begun to feel that she should scream in 
the complete silence of the diaing-room when Mortimer 
unexpectedly made a remark. 

' ' Gora arrives to-morrow. Will you meet her ? I shall 
not have time." 

' ' Of course. I shall be delighted to see her again. It 
would have been an ideal arrangement if I could have 
left her here with you when I went to Europe." 

"Yes. She was here for a week. I missed her when 
she left." 

"W — h — at? When was she here? You never told 
me." 

' ' I forgot. It was soon after you left. The ship was 
disabled — fire, I think, — and put back. I asked her to 
stay here until the next sailing." 

"How jolly." 

Agaia there was a complete silence. But Alexina did 
not notice it. Her brain was whirling. After all, she 
might be mistaken ! Mortimer ! He might be innocent. 
... To think of Gora as a thief was fantastic . . . was 
it? . . . Was she not Mortimer's sister? . . . Why he 
rather than she ? . . . And what after all did she know 
of Gora? . . . She inspired some people with distrust, 
even fear. . . . That might be the cause of Mortimer's 
depression. . . . He knew it. . . . 

At all events it was a straw and she grasped it as if 
it had been a plank in mid-ocean. With even a bare 
chance that Mortimer was innocent it would be unpardonable to insult and wound him. . . . Nor was it quite 
possible to ask him if his sister were a thief. She must 
wait, of course. 

And if Gora had taken the bonds they might be re- 
covered. It would be like a woman to secrete them in a 
reaction of terror after having nerved herself up to the 
deed. 

She wished that Gora had gone to Hong Kong. Bolted. 



 

Then she could be certain. But at least she had a respite, and she felt so ebullient that she almost forgot her 
loss, and swept Morty over to the Lawtons after dinner;, 
and the Judge took them all to the movies. 



CHAPTER IX 



ALEXINA would listen to no remonstrance. Gora 
 might send her trunks to Geary Street if she liked, 
but she must come home to Ballinger House and spend 
at least one night with her brother and sister, who had 
missed her quite dreadfully. Gora wondered how Alexina could have missed her so touchingly in Europe, but 
accepted the invitation, as a note from the surgeon to 
whom she had written by the previous steamer asked her 
to hold herself in readiness for an operation a week 
hence. 

Gora was looking remarkably well, and Alexina assumed it was not only the six months of mountain life 
and the three months in the tropics. She had an air of 
assured power, rarely absent in a woman who has found 
herself and achieved a definite place in life. Besides 
being one of the best nurses in San Francisco, in constant demand by the leading doctors and surgeons, her 
short stories had attracted considerable attention in the 
magazines, although no publisher would risk bringing 
them out in book form. But they were invariably mentioned in any summary of the year's best stories, one had 
been included in a volume of selected short stories by 
modern authors, and one in a recent text-book compiled 
for the benefit of aspirants in the same difScult art. The 
remuneration had been insignificant, for her stories were 
not of the popular order, and she had not yet the name 
that alone commands the high reward; but she had advanced farther than many another as severely handicapped, and she knew through her admiring sister-in- 
law and Aileen Lawton that her stories were mentioned 



 

occasionally at a San Francisco dinner table and even 
discussed ! She was "arriving." No doubt of that. 





"When will the novel come out? I can't wait." 

"Not until the spring." 

They were sitting in Alexina's room and Gora had 
been placed directly in front of the cabinet, which she 
did not appear even to see. She had taken off her hat 
and coat and was holding the heavjr masses of hair away 
from her head. 

"Do you mind? I feel as if I had a twenty-pound 
weight. ..." 

'i"What a question ! Do what you want. '' 

Gora took out the pins and let down her hair. It was 
not as fine as Alexina's, but it was brown and warm and 
an unusual head of hair for these days. It fell down 
both sides of her face, and her long cold unrevealing 
eyes looked paler than ever between her sun-burned, 
cheeks and her low heavy brows. 

Alexina knew that she had an antagonist far worthier 
of any weapons she might find in her armory than poor 
Morty, but she believed she could trap her if she were 
guilty. . . . And she must be . . . she must. . . . 

"Didn't you find it too hot in the tropics for writing?"
