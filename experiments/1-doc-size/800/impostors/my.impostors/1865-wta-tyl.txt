leaving the rebel soldier in charge of him to believa 
that he was in league with the powers of darkness, and 
had been spirited away by some diabolical imp. 

In the range of improbable theories which the fertile 
mind of Somers suggested to account for the phenome- 
non of the chimney, this seemed more reasonable than 
any of the others. The personage below him very con- 
siderately dropped down a step or two, to enable our 
theorist to discuss the question to his own satisfaction ; 
albeit it did not take him a tithe of the time to do his 
thinking which it has taken his biographer to re- 
cord it. 

"Captain?" said he in a gentle whisper, as insinuat- 
ing as the breath of a summer evening to a love-sick 
girl. 

" I ain't a captain : I'm nothing but a private ! ' : 
growled the other, who seemed to be in very ill- 
humor. 

Nothing but a private ! It was not the captain then, 
after all. He had hoped, and almost believed, it was. 
He had told his friend all about his experience in a 
chimney ; and it seemed to him quite probable that the 
valiant hero of Magenta and Solferino had remembered 
the affair, and attempted to try his own luck in a sftnilar 
manner. It was not the voice of the captain, nor were 
there any of his peculiarities of tone or manner. If the 



 

other character had only said Balaclava, Alma, or 
Palestro, it would have been entirely satisfactory in 
any tone or in any manner. 

"What are you doing here?" demanded Somers in 
the same low voice, with a commendable desire to 
obtain further knowledge of the dark subject beneath 
him. 

" I don't want nothin' of you : so yer kin let me alone. 
If yer don't let me alone, I'll be dog derned if I don't 
ketch hold of yer legs, and pull yer down chimley." 

" Hush ! " said Somers in warning tones. " They 
will. hear you, if you speak so loud." 

The man was a rebel, or at least a Southerner ; and it 
passed our hero's comprehension to determine what he 
was doing in such a place. 

"Hush yerself!' snarled the disconcerted rebel. 
" What yer want o' me ? I hain't done nothin' to 
you." 

" I don't want any thing of you ; but, if you don't 
keep still, I'll drop a stone on your head," replied 
Somers, irritated by the fellow's stupidity. 

"Will yer? 

f 

" Not if you keep still. Don't you see we are in the 
same box? I don't want to be <caught, any more than 
you do." 

"Who be yer?" asked the man, a little mollified by 
this conciliatory remark. 



 

"- Never mind who I am now. The soldiers are in the 
house looking for us ; and, if you make a noise, they will 
hear you." 

"What regiment do yer belong ter?" said the lower 
occupant of the chimaey in a whisper. 

" Forty-first," replied Somers at a venture, willing to 
obtain the advantage of the fellow's silence. 

" Did yer run away ? " 

"No. Did you?" 

What yer in here fur, if yer didn't run away, "nen?" 
asked the deserter from the rebel armies, which it was 
now sufficiently evident was his character. 

"Keep still! " replied Somers, regretting that he had 
not given a different answer. 

" I know yer ! " exclaimed the rebel, making a move- 
ment farther down the chimney, thereby detaching 
sundry pieces of stone and mortar, which thundered 
down upon the hearth below with a din louder, as it 
seemed to Somers in his nervousness, than all the bat- 
teries of the Army of the Potomac. " Yer come to 
ketch me in a trap. Scotch me if I don't blow yer 
up so high 'twill take yer six months ter come down 
again ! 





Keep still ! " pleaded Somers, in despair ai the un- 
reasonableness of the rebel. " The soldiers Are after 
me  and, if they catch me, they will catch you. I don't 
want to hurt you. If you will only keep still, I will 
help you out of the scrape." 



 

" You go to Babylon ! Yer can't fool me ! What yer 
tloin' in the chimley fur?" 

If Sorners could quietly have put a bullet through 
the fellow's head, and thus have punished him for the 
crime of desertion, he might have promoted his own 
cause : but the bullet would not do its work without 
powder, and powder was noisy ; and therefore the 
remedy was as bad as the disorder, to say nothing 
of assuming to himself the duty of a rebel provost- 
marshal. 

" Yer can't fool ine ! ' : repeated the fellow, after 
Somers had tried for a moment the effect of silence 
upon him. 

It was unnecessary to fool such an idiot ; for Nature 
had effectually done the job without human intervention. 
It was useless to waste words upon him ; and Somers 
crept cautiously up out of his reach, and out of his 
hearing, unless he yelled out his insane speeches. 
Every moment he stopped to listen for sounds within 
the house ; but he could hear none, either because 
the pursuers had abandoned the search, or because the 
double thickness of wood and stone shut out the 
noise. 

The rebel deserter, for a wonder, kept quiet when 
Somers retreated from him, evidently believing that 
actions spoke louder than words. From his lower 
position in the flue, he could look up into the light, 



 

and observe the movements of him whom he regarded 

o 

as an enemy. He seemed to have discretion enough 
to keep still, so long as no direct attack was made 
upon him ; and to be content to wait for a direct 
assault before he attempted to repel it ; which was 
certainly more than Somers expected of him, after 
what had transpired. 

Carefully and noiselessly our fugitive made his way to 
the top of the chimney for the purpose of ascertaining 
the position of the pursuers, as well as to remove al] 
ground of controversy with the intractable deserter. 
Oo reaching the top, he heard the voice of the ser- 
geant at the window, who had probably just reached 
this point in his investigations. 

" How came this board knocked off ? " demanded the 
sergeant, who had perhaps observed some other indica- 
tions of the advance of the fugitive in this direction. 

" The wind blowed it off t'other day," promptly re- 
plied the farmer. " Yer don't s'pose the feller went out 
that winder, do yer?" 

" JSTo ; but I think he has been up here somewhere." 

" Well, I hope yer'll find him ; but I've showed yer 
into every hole and corner in the house ; and I tell yer 
he's five mile from this yere 'fore now." 

The sergeant looked out the window, looked up to the 
top of the chimney, and looked up to the ridge-pole of the 
house. He was no sailor himself; and, if the thought 




had occurred to him that the Yankee had passed from 
this window to the roof of the house, he would have 

been willing to take his Bible oath that not a man in the 



Southern Confederacy could have accomplished such an 
impossible feat. He could not do it himself, and con- 
sequently he believed that no other man could. After 
examining the situation to his entire satisfaction, he 
retired from the window, and with a great many im- 
polite and wicked oaths, aimed at Yankees in general, 
and deserters in particular, he descended from the loft, 
and abandoned the search. 

Somers was happy, and even forgave the deserter in 
the lower part of the chimney for his stupidity. He 
waited patiently for the troopers to depart, very pa- 
tiently, now that the burden of the peril seemed to be 
over ; for he had heard the conclusions of the sergeant 
at the window. From his present perch near the 
top of the chimney, he could hear some of the conver- 
sation in front of the house ; and he even ventured to 
take a look at his enemies below. To his intense satis- 
faction, he saw them mount their horses ; and he was not 
much disturbed by the unamiable reflections which they 
cast upon him. 

Captain de Banyan was with them ; thus proving in 
the most conclusive manner that the gentleman in the 
chimney was not this distinguished individual. Having 
lost one prisoner, they were particularly cautious in 



regard to the disposition of the other. The captain 
marched off in gloomy dignity, with two cavalrymen 
before and two behind him. Somers caught a -glance 
at his face as he turned the corner into the road. It 
was sad beyond anv tiling which he had ever observed 



in his countenance before, and a momentary twinge of 
conscience upbraided him for deserting a comrade in 
such an hour : he might have waited till both of them 
could escape together. But the captain's record in the 
Third Tennessee assured him that he had only done 
his duty ; though he hoped his brilliant friend would be 
able, if an opportunity was ever presented, to remove 
the stain which now rested on his name and fame. 

TVilli a feeling of intense relief, however much he 
commiserated the misfortunes of his comrade, Somers 
saw the little procession move up the road which led to 
Richmond and a rebel dungeon. They disappeared ; and 
while he was considering in what manner he should 
make his way down to the creek, where he hoped to find 
a boat in which to leave this treacherous soil, he heard a 
voice beneath him, and farther down than the locality of 
the deserter. 

" Yer kin come down now, Tom," said the farmer. 

Though the name was his own, the invitation was 
evidently not intended for him ; and he remained quietly 
on his perch, waiting for further developments. 
Hev they all gone, dad?" asked the deserter. 



.. 



 

" Yes : all gone. Yer kin come down now." 

The renegade, then, was the son of the farmer ; which 
accounted for the unwillingness of the latter to have the 
house searched by the soldiers : and, though Sorners had 
a general contempt for deserters, he felt his indebtedness 
to this interesting family for the service they had unwit- 
tingly endeavored to render him. 

Tom Somers wanted to have his name changed then 
Tom descended from his position in the chimney. It 
was an easy matter ; for the kitchen was at the other end 
of the house, and there had been no fire on this hearth 
for many a month. 

" Dad," said this graceless son of a graceless sire. 

" Go and wash yer face, Tom. Yer blacker than 
Black Jack." 

" Dad, there's another man up the chimley. We come 
near havin' a fight up there. I told him what I would 
do ; and he got skeered, and went up top." 

"What d' yer mean, Tom?" demanded the patriarch. 

Tom stated again, more explicitly than before, the 
subject-matter of his startling communication. 

" I reckon he's a Yank, dad : he talks like one, but 
says he b'lougs to the Forty-fust Virginny. I know he's 
a Yank. I kin smell one a mile off." 

Somers was flattered ; but he was not angry at the 
compliment, and calmly waited for an invitation to join 
the family below. 



 

" He's the feller that gin the soldiers the slip," added 
the father. " The sergeant says he's a Yank ; but t'other 
prisoner says he's a James-River pilot." 

" I know he's a Yank. He'd a killed me if I hadn't 
skeered him off." 

" I reckon he skeered you more'n you skeered him," 
added the head of the family, who appeared not to have 
a very high opinion of his son's courage. "We'll smoke 
him out, Tom. Go'n git some pitch -wood and sich 
truck." 

Somers had a very strong objection to being smoked 
out, and he commenced a forward and downward move- 
ment in the direction of the assailing party. Fearing 
that some unworthy advantage might be taken of his 
lower extremities before he could assume an attitude of 
defence, he drew his pistol, and placed himself a few feet 
above the fire-place. Tom returned with the fuel, and 
the old man ordered him to make a fire. 

" One moment, if you please," said Somers. " I'll 
shoot the first man of you that attempts to make a fire 
there." 

With an -exclamation of terror, Tom retreated from 
the hearth ; and Somers, improving the opportunity, 
leaped down from his perch. Stepping out from the 
great fire-place, he stood in the presence of the hopeful 
son and sire. 





CHAPTER XXIV. 

A BROKEN BARGAIN. 

OMERS was entirely satisfied with himself 
when he stood in the presence of the farmer 
and his son ; and, so far as they were concerned, 
he had no fears for the future. The redoubta- 
ble Tom retired to one corner of the room, and, full of 
terror, awaited the issue. The father was the braver of 
the two, and stood in the middle of the floor, confront- 
ing the pestilent Yankee who had thus so unceremoni- 
ously invaded his house. 

" Who be you?" demanded the old man. 
" No matter who I am," replied Somers, with the 
pistol still in his hands. " I propose to spend the day 
with you, and will pay for every thing I have." 

" Perhaps yer will stay here, and perhaps yer won't," 
replied the farmer doggedly. 

There is no perhaps about it : I intend to stay here." 
I s'pose yer don't keer whether I'm willing or not." 
" On the contrary, I do care. I had much rather staj> 
with your consent than without." 



" Well, then, yer won't stay with my consent.'' 

" Then I shall stay without it," answered Somers, 
with a degree of decision which was exceedingly annoy- 
ing to his involuntary host. 

" No, yer won't," growled the farmer. 

"I will pay you well for the use of this room, and for 
all that I eat and drink," said Somers, wishing to be 
fully understood. 

" Yer can't stay here." 
No, yer can't," added Tom. 

I have made you a fair offer, and am willing to do 
what is right ; and, as I said before, I intend to stay here 
till to-night, whether you are willing or not." 

" Yer kin put up your pistol : I ain't afeerd on it." 

" I have no desire to use the pistol to your injury, 
and shall not do so unless in self-defence. You know 
that I am a fugitive." 

" A nigger, by gracious ! " exclaimed the farmer, 
whose vocabulary was very limited, and who had no idea 
that the word " fugitive ' : ' could mean any thing but a 



runaway negro. 

" You know that the soldiers are after me, and it will 
not be safe for me to leave this house before dark. I'm 
not a nigger ; and it makes no difference to you what I 
am." 

" You are a dirty Yankee ; and I'd rather hev a hun- 
dred niggers in my house than one Yankee." 



" That's a matter of taste. If you are fond of ne. 
groes, I don't interfere with you for that." 

" Shet up ! " snarled the farmer, highly displeased with 
the answer of the fugitive. u I won't hev a Yankee in 
my house a single hour." 

" Very well : we won't argue the matter. You can do 
any thing you please about it," replied Somers with per- 
fect indifference as he seated himself in a chair. 

" Then yer kin leave." 

" I shall not leave : on the contrary, I shall remain 
here till night." 

" I reckon we'll see about that. I'll jest go down and 
call up two or three of them soldiers, and let 'em know 
you're a Yankee. I calkilate they'll tote you out of this 
rather sudden." 

Go ahead ! " replied Somers coolly. 
I reckon ye'll tell another story by the time they 
git here." 

" I reckon your son Tom will too," added the unwel- 
come guest. 

" See here, dad : that won't work, nohow," interposed 
the hopeful son. " They'll ketch me if yer do." 

" Exactly so," added Somers, who, of course, had de- 
pended upon the situation of the rebel deserter for his 
own safety. 

The farmer looked at his intractable guest, and then 
upon his dutiful son ; and the idea tardily passed through 




 

his dull brain thaMhe soldiers would be just as dangerous 
to the welfare of the son as to the visitor. Probably he 
had intended, when the military force came, to send Tom 
up the chimney, as he had done a dozen times before ; 
but the secret was no longer in the keeping of the family 
alone. 

" I see you understand the case perfectly," said 
Somers, as he contemplated with intense satisfaction 
the blank dismay of both father and son. " If you had 
the wisdom of Solomon, you couldn't comprehend it any 
better." 

" I reckon yer about right, stranger," replied the 
farmer. 

" You can see now it is for your interest as well as 
mine that we make friends. Tom's safety and mine are 
both the same thing. The best you can do is to take 
good care of me to-day, and at night help me to make 
my way over to the other side of the river." 

4G Then yer be a Yank ? ' 

" I didn't say so. Tom can go with me if he likes. 
He will be safer there than here." 

"Tom?" . 

" If he is a deserter from the rebel army, he will be 
caught sooner or later, and be shot. He will be safe 
on the other side of the river." 

" Go over to the Yanks ! He hates 'em wurs'n pizin 
Don't yer, Tom?" 



 

" Bet yer life I do, dad," replied the hopeful son. u J 
won't go over thar, nohow." 

" Just as he pleases about that. I only wanted to d(? 
him a friendly act." 

" Well, stranger, I don't mind keepin' yer to-day ; but 
Tom can't go with yer." 

" Very well : then I will stay in this room ; and, if the 
soldiers come, I can go up the chimney with Tom," re- 
plied Somers. u I'm tired and sleepy. Didn't sleep a 
wink last night. I will take a nap on the floor. You 
will wake me, Tom, if there's any danger ; won't you ? ' 

" Yes, I'll wake yer," replied the deserter with a 
broad grin. 

" We'll see that yer don't git caught ; kase, if yer do, 
of course, Tom'll git caught too," added the farmer. 

There was something in his manner which Somers did 
not like. Though he was a man of dull mind, there was 
a kind of low cunning visible in his look and manner 
which warned Somers to be cautious. He stretched 
himself on the floor ; and the farmer and his son left 
the room, closing the door behind them. 

Our scout was, as he had before declared, both tired 
and sleepy ; but rest and sleep were luxuries in which he 
could not permit himself to indulge in the midst of so 
much peril and so many enemies. As soon as the door 
closed behind the sire and the son, he rose from his re- 
clining posture, and hastened to reconnoitre the position. 



 

The enemy for such he was fully assured his host was 
passed through the entry, and out the door at the back 
of the house, as Somers discovered from the noise of 

their retreating footsteps. 



There was a window in the rear of the room, which 
commanded a full view of them as they paused near the 
door to consider the situation. Somers raised the sash 
a little, so that he could hear what they said, not doubt- 
ing that his own case would be the subject of the con- 
versation. 

" Don't you do it, dad," protested Tom in answer to 
some proposition which the farmer had made before the 
listener came within hearing distance of them. 

" Don't yer be skeert, Tom. The feller's gone ter 
sleep in there, and the soldiers kin hurry him off afore 
he wakes up. Don't yer see, Tom? I reckon the 
Yank's an officer, and they'll give me sunthin hand- 
some for ketchin him." 

" Yes ; but, dad, they'll get sunthin handsome fur 
tatchin me too." 

" You kin hide, as yer allers does when they comes." 

" But the Yank will blow on me." 

" What if he does?" 

" He'll tell 'em I'm up chimley, and then they'll look 
fur me." 

"Tom, yer a bigger fool'n yer father!' said the 
farmer petulantly. " Can't yer hide in t'other place down 
suller?" 


" It looks kinder skeeiy, dad," replied the doubtful 
son. 

" Yer used ter hide down suller more'n yer did up 
chimley. But don't yer see, Tom, arter I've called in 
the soldiers, and give up the Yank, they'll think I'm a 
patriot, and won't b'leeve nothin' a dirty Yank can say 
agin me?" 

" Well, dad, I hate the Yank as bad as you do ; but 
yer must be keerful." 

" Now go and see that the feller don't wake up and 
run off, and I'll go down arter a sergeant and half a 
dozen men. When yer hear us comin', just step down 
suller'n crawl inter the drean. Git the feller's pistol 
out of his pocket, if yer kin, while he's asleep." 

" What a precious old scoundrel that man is ! ' 
thought Somers, as he retreated from the window, and 
threw himself on the floor where the farmer had left 
him. 

He almost regretted that he had not used his pistol on 
the treacherous old villain, who had made a fair bargain 
with him, and agreed to the terms of the contract. The 
wretch had actually gone after the soldiers to entrap 
him, and Tom was to remain and keep watch of him 
in the mean time. Taking the revolver from his pocket, 
he thrust it under his blouse ; still keeping his hand upon 
it, so as to make sure that the deserter did not carry out 
his part of the programme. Thus prepared for the con- 



 

flict which might ensue, or for any other event, he closed 
his eyes, and pretended to be asleep. 

Presently the door softly opened, and Tom crept into 
the room. He had taken off his shoes, that his step on 
the imcarpeted floor might not disturb his prey, and stole 
towards him. After approaching as near to the pros- 
trate form as he dared, he bent over him to determine 
in which pocket the pistol had been placed. Somers 
was tempted to grapple him by the throat, as he lis- 
tened to the young villain's subdued breathing ; but he 
feared that he would scream if he did so, and it was 
necessary to achieve his conquest in a more gentle 
manner. 

lie moved his body a little, as if his slumbers were 
disturbed by unpleasant dreams ; and added a noise like 
a snore to complete the delusion. Tom retired for a 
moment till his victim should again be composed ; but 
Somers-, instead of subsiding into the slumber of a sleepy 
and tired man, gradually opened his eyes and waked up. 
Slowly rising into a sitting posture, he looked around 
him ; and apparently, as if entirely by accident, he dis- 
cerned Tom. 

"Can't yer sleep?' asked Tom, with extraordinary 
good nature for a person of his saturnine disposition. 

" I've been asleep these two hours, I believe," gaped 
Somers. " What time is it, Tom? " 

" 'Tain't eight o'clock yet. Yer hain't been asleep 
more'n fifteen minutes." 



 

"Haven't I?" 

" Not raore'n that. Better lay down, and finish yef 
flap ; kase I spose yer won't git much sleep to-night, if 
yer gwine over the river." 

"I feel better than I did r at any rate. I think I'll 
get up. It's tremendous hot here. Don't you ever open 
your windows ? ' 

" I reckon we do. I was just thinkin' o' that." 

And it was quite probable he was thinking of it ; for 
he certainly wanted the earliest information of the ap- 
proach of the soldiers. He opened the window in the 
front of the house, and Somers opened that in the rear. 
The latter then went to the door, and took a careful sur- 
vey of the entry, in order to determine the way which 
the deserter must take to reach the cellar, where he was 
to conceal himself when the soldiers came. The pru- 
dent son of the master of the house had opened the door 
leading to the cellar, from which he was to enter his 
subterranean retreat. 

For more than an hour, Tom nervously watched the 
wakeful Yankee, and several times suggested to him that 
he could sleep just as well as not, promising to wake 
him up if there was any danger ; but Somers was most 
provokingly lively for a man who had been up all the 
preceding night, and resolutely refused to take a hint or 
to adopt a suggestion. Both of them were fearfully 
anxious for the result that was pending, and each had 




his plan for overreaching the other. It was a long hour ; 
but at last Tom broke the spell which seemed to rest on 
both of them by declaring that he was " clean choked 
up," and must go and get a drink of water. At the 
same moment, Sorners heard the tramp of the soldiers 
in the road as they approached the house, and under- 
stood why his companion had suddenly become so 
thirsty. 

" No," said Somers, placing himself between the 
deserter and the door, with the revolver in his hand. 
" I don't want to be left alone. Somebody is coming to 
the house, half a dozen men. They are soldiers ! " he 
exclaimed, glancing out at the window. 

" Run right up chimley thar, and you'll be as safe as 
if you was t'other side of the river." 

" But they'll catch you too ! Come, Tom, up chim- 
ney with you, and I'll follow. If any one attempts tt> 
follow us, I'll shoot him with my pistol. Be in a hurry. 
Tom ! We have no time to spare," urged Somers, driv- 
ing the coward before him towards the fire-place. 

" You go up fust," pleaded Tom, in mortal terror of 
the revolver. 

" Up with you, or I'll blow your brains out ! " added 
Somers in a low, fierce tone, which frightened his com- 
panion half out of his wits. 

" Don't fire, and I will," replied the wretch, as he 
stepped into the fire-place, and commenced the ascent of 
the chimney. 



 



" Up with you ! " repeated Somers. " Now, if you 
attempt to come down, I'll shoot you." 

The voice of the farmer, leading the soldiers to then 
prey, was now heard close to the house ; and Somer 
deemed it prudent no longer to remain in the room. 
Darting out into the entry, he made his way to the 
cellar, closing the door behind him just as the rebels 
were about to enter. 

"Where is he?" demanded the sergeant, who belonged 
to the battery at the works near the house. 

" In this room," replied the farmer, putting his hand 
on the door of the apartment where he had seen the 
victim lie down to sleep an hour before. " But yer 
must be keerful with him. He had a pistol, and mebbe 
he mought shoot some on us." 

" We aren't afraid of all the Yankees this side of the 
North Pole," added the sergeant, as he pushed the door 
open and entered the room, followed by his squad of 
soldiers. " Where is he ? There aren't no Yankee 
here." 

" Well, he was here an hour ago," said the farmer. 

" See here, old man, if you've been makin' a fool of 
us this hot day, I'll spit you on my bayonet. We heard 
that a deserter and a Yankee had been taken, and that 
the cavalry iost one of them." 



" That 'was the Yankee. They lost him, and I found 
him again." 



 



"Where is he, then?" 

" He aren't far from here," said the farmer, walking 
up to the fire-place, and pointing up the chimney, where 
he had no doubt the victim had retired when he heard 
the soldiers approaching. 

"Up there?' 

" That's where the feller hid when the troopers was 
lookin' for him ; and yer kin be sure he's up there now
But yer must be keerful ; fur he's got a pistol, and is a 
mighty savage fellow." 

" We'll soon bring him down," added the sergeant, as
