" I came to keep him from marrying Ellen," said Hugh. 
" But it's done." 






Did you want Ellen? " asked Mary, still clinging ta 
him and forgetting Ben, who stood with miserable eyes on 
them. "Oh, my darling, it's too late. And didn't she 
love you? How could she help loving you? " 

" It's not too late," said Hugh, " until I've seen her." 
He loosed himself from his mother and started down the 
slope. But she followed, and clung to his arm, and Ben 
walked beside her. Grissie, below, watched them com- 
ing, and they seemed so tall up there on the hill and so 
awesome in their striding haste, that she fled along the 
road to her own home. Mary talked with a quick vehe- 
mence as they went down the hill : 

" Don't say things to her, Hugh, dreadful things, you 
know. I'm very fond of Ellen. She has married Ben. 
Don't you realize that, Hugh? She has married Ben." 

But Hugh did not answer, and when they got to the 
door he opened it and strode in, leaving his mother to 
come after him. Mary, as she slipped in behind him, went 
at once to the door of her husband's room and closed it 
softly. And as she turned, she saw Hugh standing just 
inside the sill of the other room, silent and Ellen facing 
him. Ben was behind his brother, and Mary did not 
know what passions or what repression moved their faces ; 
but as she looked at Ellen she saw a strange thing. 
Ellen at first seemed aghast with wonder. Then the 
color came flooding over her face, and it bloomed into 
ecstasy. She began to smile, tremulously at first, and 
then she laughed a little. And the end was that she went 
forward a step, two paces — Hugh had not moved toward 
her — and he took her into his arms. She lifted her face 
to him, and he kissed it again and again. 

"He's kissed you," said Hugh, in a hoarse, exultant 
voice. " But I can't help that. Whatever's done I can't 
help it. But, by God, he sha'n't again." 



 

Ellen withdrew from him a little and laughed up into 
his eyes. Her own were the eyes of happiness ; her voice 
was exquisite. 

" But nobody's kissed me — like that,'' she said. 
" And nobody ever shall." 

Hugh, now with an arm about her, remembered the 
others and threw a glance at them. It was a conquer- 
or's glance, but it was desperate. He knew, though Ellen 
seemed joyously to forget, what walls towered between 
them. And then Ellen saw Ben and her brows were trou- 
bled and she spoke like a child: 

"Ben, I'm sorry. But I didn't know. Not till last 
night. I told you then. Why, there's never been any- 
body but Hugh." 

Ben stood looking at her. He felt the shame of the 
unjustly used; for Ellen, his angry mind told him, was 
as accountable for taking him as he was for entreating 
her. Vague phrases about the law's impartiality were 
floating through his mind. Mary went forward and put 
a gentle hand on Ellen's arm. It was time, she thought, 
to persuade her away from that grasp of Hugh's. 

" Sit down, dear," she said. " Hugh's just come, 
you know. We've got a good many things to talk 
over." 

" Oh, let me stay with him," said Ellen. " He's been 
gone so long." She laid her cheek on his shoulder an in- 
stant, and then smiled up in his face, and withdrew from 
him. " Sit down," she said. " Your mother's hardly 
seen you." 

So they all sat down, and that seemed a strange, acqui- 
escent thing to do. This was a battle. It had to be 
fought out. How could it be fought except on foot? 

" Ellen ! " said Ben sharply. He meant to lose no ad- 
vantage and no more self-respect by being treated like the 



 

prisoner at the bar. "Don't you remember you were 
married to me yesterday ? " 

Ellen turned to him in an impulsive warmth. 

"Oh, yes," she said. "That's what makes it dread- 
ful. Mrs. Neale, you mustn't blame Hugh. It was 
over before he came. I told Ben. It was when you 
brought me upstairs and kissed me and left me in that 
room. And when you had gone, I ran into my own 
room and locked the door, and when he spoke to me 
through the keyhole, I said, " Never ! never ! ' " 

Now Mary Neale's heart was with her other son, who 
had been deceived and, though innocently, tricked. 

"You said * never'?" she repeated. "But you were 
married, Ellen. Why didn't you say it before? " 

Ellen looked at her and it was impossible to believe she 
was not telling the truth. 

" I don't know," she said. " Truly, I don't know. I 
thought about it a great deal, last night. I didn't sleep. 
And I thought perhaps girls often don't know, till it is 
over, just what they've done." 

" I suppose," said Mary, in irrepressible bitterness, 
" if you'd married Hugh, you'd have said ' never,' and 
expected him to go away." 

" Oh, no," said Ellen, the ecstatic flush again in her 
face. " Oh, no ! not Hiigh. I understand now. Love ! " 

She said the word broodingly, and really to herself, but, 
Hugh knew, as he looked at her, possessed by him, the im- 
age of him trembling for her in every atom of the world. 
But Mary, though loving him, was the more on fire for 
justice to her other son. 

" You could have stayed awake and thought it out be- 
fore," she said. " Nobody made you marry Ben. You 
did it of your own free will." 

" Oh, but it was because Qrissie was telling those dread- 



 

fill things about him," said Ellen, " and they made you 
unhappy. She told lies about him, Hugh. And it was 
true, what he said to me. If he were married, she would 
stop persecuting him. And I like Ben. He hadn't been 
silly, as other boys are. Or rough, Hugh ! " She laughed 
a little, and he knew she was remembering the violet bank 
and that she had forgiven him at last. " O Ben ! '' said 
she, " I'm sorry." Ben was silent, looking at her. His 
mind was a battlefield. There was the jealousy incident 
to another's triumph; but there was, too, the wish that 
he could walk out of the room without being a coward, 
and the certainty that he'd got to fight it out with Hugh 
or suffer the ignominy of being thrown. "I was sorry 
last night," said Ellen timidly. " I saw what I'd done. 
I was sorry till this morning, about an hour ago. And 
then I began to be happy. I know why, now. Hugh 
was coming." She turned to Hugh again, with that look 
of possessive eloquence. 

" You see," said Hugh to his mother, and again Ben 
was enraged at his own small place in a drama that really 
concerned him somewhat. 

" Now I'm going," said Ellen. She got up and looked 
at Mary Neale beseechingly. "You can't ever like me 
again, Mrs. Neale. I see that. I'm going home." 

"To your mother?" asked Mary, confused because 
there was no clear right to champion. 

"Why, no," said Ellen, surprised. "I couldn't go 
there." She did not mention Peleg, but the vision of him 
seemed suddenly to rise up in the room. " To the little 
house. That's my home." 

Mary got up and followed her to the door. She was 
troubled over the foolishness of it, too, the silly incon- 
veniences. 

" Why, there's nothing over there to cat," she said. 



 

"I don't want anything," said Ellen. She laughed 
suddenly and looked the more beautiful. " I'll go down to 
Larry's and ask him to let me eat with him." 

Hugh had risen, and now he said to her : 

" That's right. Go home, and I'll come to you. 
Mother'll come with me." 

" I'll come, too," said Ben sardonically. " And I 
sha'n't need to take mother to call on my own wife." 

So Ellen, without a look at any of them, went away 
across the orchard to her house. Then Mary turned to 
Hugh. 

" Don't you think," said she, " you'd better go in and 
see your father? " 

Hugh considered for a minute. It was, he thought, 
taking a base advantage of his father who didn't want to 
see him. But he felt, too, that because his father was 
incapable he must not be deceived. He must know his 
son was there. 

" Yes," he said, " after we've talked about Grissie." 

"What is it about Grissie?" asked Mary quickly. 

" You'd better talk it over now," said Hugh. " I'll go 
in and see father." 



XXXI 

Hugh crossed the hall and opened the door of his 
father's room. He stood facing the bed and those eyes 
immovably fixed. Neale had heard the mingled voices in 
the other room and wondered; now, seeing Hugh, he 
thought he knew what had made the tumult. But his 
face did not relax. His hands, whitened from idleness, 
lay on the sheet, unmoving. Hugh stood there a minute 
perhaps, but what seemed to him a long time, taking in 
the strangeness of the room with its ordered conveniences 
adapted to this dark drama. The vines tapped at the 
window, and the light was pleasantly subdued; but it 
seemed to him this was no room in his father's house, only 
perhaps the embodiment of his father's misery. Neale's 
face he did not understand. He had not been used to in- 
terrogating it in the past; it was a cloud portending 
storm, to be escaped. Now it showed suffering, but noth- 
ing else. He had wondered when he heard about the ac- 
cident whether Neale was lying there thinking back — to 
his youth, to the time when there must have been some 
softnesses for him to cling to, whether he had a thought 
of Mary who had had no tender words from him. But this 
was the face of mystery, as blank to all inquiry as the 
mask of death, but not with death's ineffable repose. All 
this Hugh thought in his minute, and then went forward 
and sat down, though wondering if he might, in the chair 
by the bedside. 

"I've just got home," he said. "Mother told me to 



come in." 



 

The questioning eyes did not turn to him. Hugh tried 
to think they could not. It was incredible to him, after 
the waves of death he had been riding there in France, 
that human eyes should not call to other eyes ready to 
meet them understandingly. Afterward he wondered if 
his father had built by accretion a shell about himself 
that would let no human seeking in, as it would let no 
emotion out. 

" I've got a lot of things to tell," he blundered. " You 
know I've been in the war over there. I fed now as if I 
never'd been anywhere else." 

But here Neale's eyes closed, and Hugh, dismayed by 
the sudden falling of that curtain, got out of his chair 
and went softly away, closing the door behind him. He 
crossed the hall and stood a moment listening. It was 
still within, and he was about to lift the latch when he 
heard his mother's voice exclaim : " My son ! " in a tone 
of incredulous revolt and shame. It was not the moment 
for him, he knew, and he ran upstairs and tapped at 
Aunt Tab's door. She opened it at once, a queer figure 
in her short gown and petticoat with curl-papers ram- 
pant. She started back a step, aghast, and then all her 
pleasure came flooding into her face and she clapped 
both hands over her mouth. 

« That's right," said Hugh. « Don't holler." 
He stepped in and closed the door, took Aunt Tab 
into his arms and kissed her on both cheeks. This was 
not as he had kissed her when he went away. He under- 
stood her better now, and he had longed to get back to 
tell her what a cub that other Hugh looked to him. He 
pushed her into her chair and sat down opposite and 
smiled at her, a man, toughened by life as much as action, 
who had gone away a boy. Yet the boy, too, was mys- 
teriously there. She found no trouble in accepting him. 



 

" Hughie," said Aunt Tab, " have you learnt to play 
your fiddle? " 

Hugh laughed out. 

" Why, Aunt Tab," said he, " my fiddle's in a London 
lodging house. I haven't seen it for months, and I 
haven't thought of it." 

Aunt Tab's brows drew together. She was much per- 
plexed. 

" There's no time for fiddling over there," said Hugh. 
" Didn't you have my letters ? You know what I've been 
doing." 

Aunt Tab shook her head. 

" We've had the letters," she said, " but it's all dark to 
me." 

"One thing you've got to understand right off," said 
Hugh. " I haven't been spending your money. I hadn't 
been on the sea two days before I saw what a chump I was 
— I don't know, it was the look of the sea maybe — " 
Here he stopped, finding he was leading her into mysteries, 
and began again. " You knew what I did. I met Pay- 
son, and we talked one day, and he took me on to work. 
And we've been in the Foreign Legion together, and some 
of your money you're going to have now and some after 
I've earned it, God knows how, when we've licked the 
Boches." 

Aunt Tab was looking at him from a state of perfect 
bliss, adoring his manly brusqueness and acquiescing in 
everything he said, so he would sit there and talk to her. 

" And Ben's married," said she. 

" Yes," said Hugh, the cloud settling again on his face. 
" So I understand. I'll go down now and see him and 
mother again. You're a darling, Tabitha, and don't you 
forget it." 

When Mary and Ben had been left alone, she turned 



 

to him and asked, uneasy, a little breathless, and knowing, 
in spite of her, what she had to meet : 

"What's this about Grissie Gleason? '' 

" Nothing," said Ben, giving her look for look. There 
was no guilt on his face. He was simply realizing that 
he had never fronted a world bare of the safety of his 
mother's love. He was not only afraid of her but of the 
world as it would be without her. There was something 
in the quiet majesty of Mary Neale that made you flinch, 
if you found yourself likely to show your smears before 
her. 

" Ben," said she, " youll have to tell me about Grissie. 
You'd better do it now. Did you promise her — 
things?" 

" I didn't promise to marry her, if you mean that," 
said Ben. Then all his defenses fell before his mother's 
look and he broke out miserably, " I was a fool to go there 
and a fool to see her. It was all fun anyway. I had 
some money. I wanted to get it changed. I didn't dare 
to do it here. So I told her I was going to a hotel. And 
somehow she said she'd go with me, and then we went off 
on a trip. She didn't offer to. I didn't ask her. We 
were just — O mother, can't you understand? We got 
laughing and it was funny. So we went." 

Mary was not looking at him now. She was afraid of 
seeing in his face some mean plausibility she could never 
forget. 

" So you went to a hotel," she said, keeping her voice 
unmoved. " Did you say she was some relation? " 

"Why, no, not exactly," said Ben fretfully. He 
thought she might be intelligent enough to help him. 
" That was the joke. It was the time everybody was talk- 
ing about Peleg and Ardelia, and we called ourselves Mr. 
and Mrs. Pdeg Simpson," 




It was then that Mary cried " My son ! " in that tone 
of pride in ruins. 

" Don't ! " said Ben. She stood there gazing past him, 
and he watched her apprehensively. But though he saw 
how terribly moved she was, he could not guess what re- 
volt was raging in her. It was not that he had done his 
ill deed, but that he had, like a child, done it foolishly, in 
no urge of passion and despair. 

" Well," said she, at last, " Pll say no more. Only, you 
must give up Ellen." 

"Give up Ellen?" cried Ben. "Fm married to her." 

Then Mary Neale broke out in a white heat of words 
that scorched: 

" I don't care whether you're married to her ten times 
over. Ellen Brock is a good girl. And you — I'm afraid 
you're half-witted." It was on this that Hugh came 
in. He looked at his mother and saw she had been 
told enough to throw her into fury. But the fury went. 
She turned again to Ben. " You said you had money," 
she began. " Where did you get it? " 

Ben was silent and looked immovably obstinate. 

" There's no need of going into that," said Hugh 
hastily. " I understand about it, mother." 

Mary turned to the door, and stood by it a moment, 
leaning against the casement. 

" Don't be afraid" said Hugh, his mind flashing back 
with hers to the struggle on the knoll. The pain of his 
arm was likely to remind him of it for a long time to come. 
" We won't scrap again, mum." 

" I don't care if you do," said something in Mary 
Neale's heart. " You may kill him if you like." 

Actually she did not say it, but she always believed 
she did, and shuddered back from the memory. That 
one thought it was that taught her what it is to commit 



 

the sudden great sins : for she always confessed to herself 
that she had done murder in her heart, — the murder 
of her son. The eating knowledge of it was so present to 
her that she bound herself then to a perfection of love 
toward Ben : the love of remorse that is like undying fire. 
She opened the door and went across the hall to her hus- 
band's room and shut herself in with him. All her mem- 
ories of his impervious silence went down once more before 
the certainty that he was her natural refuge. She was 
blind with tears, and she crossed the room and fell on her 
knees and buried her face in the clothes beside him. She 
knelt there and sobbed, and after a moment he moved 
slightly and she believed his hand had touched her hair. 
The renewed wonder of it was enough to stiD her crying. 
She had not, in her heart, expected anything but to put 
her wet cheek against the rock of his endurance. She 
gathered herself together, with a long breath, and got 
up, but first taking the kind hand that had slipped from 
her hair and passionately kissing it. 

" It's nothing," she said. " Only I'm foolish. Hugh's 
coming back and all — and thinking you're lying 
here." 

This last she added to clench his belief that nothing 
actually was the matter. She could not have him suspect- 
ing ill and lie there raging over his infirmity. Then she 
went out and again into the room across the way, where 
Hugh stood looking from the window and Ben lay on the 
sofa, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his hands clasped under 
his head. Mary judged they had not spoken. Ben 
sprang up, and Hugh turned quickly to her. They saw 
the tears on her face, and both remembered they had never 
seen her cry. 

" Ben," she said, " about that money. Tell me where 
you got it." 



 

" I gave it to him," said Hugh instantly. " I told you, 
mum." 

You're standing up for him," said Mary. " I want 
him to tell me himself. Ben, you didnH take your father's 
money? " 

Ben did not answer. He was as resentful at being ac- 
cused of the one offense as if he had committed none. 

" Truly," said Hugh. " It was some of Aunt Tab's." 

Mary looked from one son to the other. She believed it 
now, but they could not interpret her face. 

" Your money," she said, " the money you were going 
away with ! " There was no reproach in the words, but 
they had an edge. " Ben, you must forgive me for what 
I said." 

He did not know what it was, — the murderous speech 
she uttered in her heart — but he was ashamed at her 
humility. He went to her and would have put his arm 
impetuously about her; but in spite of her remorse she 
drew away from him. 

" No," she said, " no ! " Then her sorrow over him 
broke out and she ended : " But don't lie to me." 

Ben, repulsed, half turned from her. Again he had his 
feeling of being the criminal at the bar where everybody 
else was impeccable. 

" I don't expect to lie," he said, " any more than any- 
body else. We all lie when we've got to." Then an im- 
pulse he hated himself for put the words into his mouth. 
" Anyway so I s'posed that time when you did — when 
you told father — " But there he stopped and, at a lit- 
tle muttered sound from Hugh, walked out of the room. 

" Well," said Mary, smiling a little at Hugh, in a way 
that made him turn his eyes from her, not to see the 
piteousness of her face, " I deserved that. It's my punish- 
ment." 



xxxn 

That afternoon Mary Neale had perhaps the strangest 
half-hour of her life. Out of the wreck of circumstance, 
she knew one thing must be saved. That was Gris- 
sie. Hugh and Aunt Tab and she had their noon din- 
ner together. Ben had vanished, where she did not 
know at the time, though it afterward appeared he had 
gone ofF with Trueman and came home late and asked 
Hannah to give him a bite in the kitchen. At dinner 
Mary could not eat for looking at Hugh, sitting there 
opposite her, bronzed, erect, hard as iron, the marks of 
thought and action on his face, though it was so young, 
but in his eyes the ecstatic light Ellen had called there 
and that had not for a moment gone away. All through 
the meal they talked about the things he had seen, and 
both women tremulously accepted his curt fiat that he was 
going back. Aunt Tab, who also left her plate untasted, 
sat with brilliant, staring eyes fixed upon him, and once or 
twice she opened her lips and did not speak. Mary did 
not ask about the fiddle. She was afraid it would recall 
the anguish of his giving it up, when he had been drawn 
into this splendor of willing death. But Hugh would have 
laughed and told her, as he told Aunt Tab, there was nQ 
anguish. He had tried to make it his voice while he 
was still inarticulate; but now he knew what his word 
was going to be. He and Payson, in their time of pro- 
bation and training, had gone mad together over the 
written line that called louder to them than the roar 
of guns, and Hugh had in his pocket at that moment 

some verse that he might possibly show Larry. Payson 

 



 

had said he " loved " it. Hugh felt superbly open- 
minded about it : only he had learned that the world is, in 
ways unexplored as yet, so large and rich a place that, 
if you don't get a chance to speak in one way, you very 
likely will in another. But when they rose from the 
table, Mary had a word to say to him. 

" Hugh," said she, after Aunt Tab had gone into the 
kitchen to see if Hannah did not think it " the crowner " 
to have Hugh back again, " I don't want you to go over 
to Ellen's till I've found time to go with you." 

Hugh looked at her in an immovable gayety of stubborn 
resolution : 

" Do you mean I'm not to see Ellen alone? " he asked. 
" Why, mum, of course I shall. I'm going over there 
straight off." 

" No," said Mary. " I'm going myself, to carry her a 
plate of dinner. And if she's there, and not down 
to Larry Greene's, I want you to go to Larry's yourself 
and stay the rest of this afternoon. And by that time I 
shall know what to do. But I don't want you to see 
Ellen." 

" Mother," said Hugh, " I've got about a week to see 
Ellen in. After that, it's a toss-up. I mightn't come 
back. Don't look like that. I believe I shall. But I 
mightn't, you know. And I'm going to see Ellen every 
minute she'll let me. I §hould be a fool if I didn't. I've 
got to make up — " 

There he stopped and shut his lips hard, and Mary saw 
she had a man to deal with, one who had, too, the suffer- 
ing of a boy to remember, and that suffering, her jealous 
heart told her, she had never known. But she insisted. 

" Wait," said she, " just this one afternoon. I don't 
know what can be done — " 

" I do," said Hugh. " Ellen is going with me." 



 

" Hugh," said Mary faintly, " that's against the law." 

" Law or no law," said Hugh grimly. 

" But," said Mary, " I'm sure of one thing. If she 
won't live with your brother, she can't live with you. And 
somehow, Hugh, whatever happens afterwards, we've got 
to do the right thing now. You can do that. Even if 
it's foolish, you'll do it. It's for her, you see. Peo- 
ple are going to make a great handle of all this some- 
time. And they mustn't blame Ellen. If you love her, 
you'll be the first to say so." 

In the end, after a good deal of obstinate demur, he 
promised, and then Mary filled a tray with food and set 
out with it for the little house, and Hugh followed her 
and took it from her and carried it across the orchard. 
At Ellen's door he gave it to her and then, without a 
word, turned back home again. Mary set down her tray 
and tried the door. It was locked, and before she could 
call, Ellen's voice within asked who was there. Mary 
had never heard her speak in such a voice. It was 
full and in a strange way exultant, as if something rich 
brinmied up in her. Whatever complications there were 
before them all, it was evident Ellen wasn't dwelling on 
them. Then she undid the door and Mary saw that the 
radiance of her look had lasted as Hugh's had done, and 
instantly, from the quick inquiry and fall of the brows 
that Ellen had expected Hugh to be with her. But she 
took the tray, with remorseful thanks, and Mary followed 
her in. 

" I locked the door," said Ellen, flushing as she made 
this which seemed to her a silly plea. " I didn't know — " 

There she stopped and Mary said: 

" You were afraid it would be Ben. I think you'd bet- 
ter not see either of my sons, Ellen, at present." 

Her voice sounded so proud that Ellen was suddenly 



 

aghast and seemed to know what she had done. She 
turned cold, and stood looking at Mary forlornly. Mary 
was instantly compassionate; but she was tried with her, 
too. It seemed so unnecessarily stupid and loose-at-ends 
to marry a man to find out you couldn't live with him. 
But she was not going to console her at present. It was 
healthy, she thought, to suffer for a moment. 

" I have asked Hugh," said she, " not to see you alone. 
I think he'll remember. But if he doesn't, I tell you the 
same. If he comes here, you're not to let him in." 

Ellen, like Hugh, straightway looked obstinate, and 
Mary inwardly lost patience. What was the matter with 
them, she wondered, man and woman grown, seeing no 
further than their own wild wishes? And as Ellen con- 
tinued to gaze at her in this heart-broken, imploring 
fashion, she had to speak, because they seemed to be slip- 
ping desperately off the rim of common-sense. " Ellen," 
said she, " you can't act that way. You're married to 
Ben. Don't you know you are? " 

" But I told him," said Ellen, " I never'd live with him 
in all the world. And I never will. And now Hugh's 
come home, I see — I know — " 

The strange exasperating look of radiance flew back 
into her face. 

" Ellen ! " said Mary Neale. She spoke patiently, as 
if she wanted to get her attention and keep it in this dif- 
ficult matter of common-sense. " It isn't as if Hugh was 
a stranger to you. You've known him all your life. You 
must be carried away by his being in the war and all." 

" Oh," said Ellen, " I'm not carried away. Yes, I am, 
but not the way you mean. Mrs. Neale, I've dreamed of 
him." 

Mary was impressed, in spite of herself, there was such 
conviction, even awe, in the girl's voice. 



 

" Well," said she, " what if you have? There's nothing 
more natural than dreaming about anybody you used to 
see every day or two, as you did Hugh." 

" Oh, but that wasn't it," said Ellen eagerly. " It was 
different. It was somebody that came from 'way off, and 
he loved me and was beautiful. I dreamed of him when 
Hugh was here, too. Though then I thought Hugh was 
nothing but a boy. And when Ben began to be so nice to 
me, the dream stopped coming. And when Hugh came in 
to-day, I knew. He was the one. I'd called him the 
stranger, but he wasn't the stranger. He was Hugh." 

She was so white, so passionately moved and sure of her 
ground, that Mary instantly believed as she did. It threw 
her back to that old time when the earth itself was smaller 
to her than the significance of one man, when she did not 
question or look beyond the circlet of the bond containing 
them. And, unconfessed, she capitulated. Mother jecd- 
ousy went down before the force of passion unashamed, 
and she rejoiced that there was such a fire in the world, 
and warmed her hands at it. 

" Well," said she, " I don't know what's going to come 
of it all. But your dinner's cold." 
I don't care," said Ellen. 

No, I s'pose you don't. I'm going home now, and you 
can lock the door behind me. And 'long the last of the 
afternoon some of us'll come over." 

She got to the door, and saw that Ellen was watching 
her, a wary yet longing look, ready to fly to her if Mary 
held out a hand. But Mary perversely would not do it. 
She had lost that gritty ingredient of mother jealousy out 
of the pure water of life, but she couldn't quite take to her 
heart the bride she had kissed last night in the bridal 
chamber. Then she went home across the orchard and 



found Hugh waiting to see her and say he was going 
down to Larry Greene's for an hour. But he hoped — 
he said it impressively — when he came home his mother 
would realize he must go over to Ellen's. Mary said 
nothing. She watched him away, the tall upright figure 
that had never looked like this a year ago, and felt she 
would have some ado to keep it from marching along 
wherever it wished. And then she took her parasol from 
the hall and went down the path and into the road. She 
dared not go into her husband's room lest he should, in 
some form, insist on her staying, and she knew Hannah 
and Trueman were at hand. She walked thoughtfully 
down to Grissie's, past Deacon Mendell's, where a flock of 
little Gleasons were digging dandelions; and Grissie, sit- 
ting on the front steps, her elbows on her knees, her chin 
in her hands, taking an interval of peace with the little 
Gleasons away, saw her and, in a sudden alarm, ran to 
meet her. Something, Grissie thought, must have hap- 
pened to bring Mary Neale that way. Mary was tre- 
mendously relieved. She could not talk before the other 
Gleasons, and she had foreseen no means of getting rid of 
them. Grissie looked to her much like the little girl 
Grissie she used to know, only that she was irreproach- 
ably tidy. She had taken off her delicate dress and put 
on a short-sleeved apron that covered her from shoulder 
to heel, and her bare arms were milk-white and her thin 
neck a loveliness. How could they, she and Ellen, Mary 
thought impatiently, be so much their childish selves and 
yet create such havoc of accepted rules? 

"I'll turn round," she said, "and you walk a piece 
with me." 

So they went back along the road by which she had 
come, and when they reached the bars to what was known
