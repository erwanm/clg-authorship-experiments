come tired of swearing and laughing at him, or he 
had made a decided improvement ; for less fault was 
found with him, and his position was much more sat- 
isfactory. With a light heart he put up the shutters ; 
for though he was very much fatigued, the prestige 
of future success was so cheering, that he scarcely 
heeded his weary, aching limbs. 

Every day was an improvement on the preceding 
day , and before the week was out, Harry fcund him- 
eelf quite at home in his new occupation. He was 
never a moment behind the time at which he was re- 
quired to be at the store in tte morning. This 




promptness was specially noted by the partners; for  
when they came to their business in the morning; 
they found the store well warmed, the floor nicely 
swept, and every thing put in order. 

When he was sent out with bundles, he did not 
stop to look at the pictures in the shop windows, to 
play marbles, or tell long stories to other boys in the 
streets. If his employers had even been very unrea- 
sonable, they could not have helped being pleased 
with the new boy, and Wake confidentially assured 
Wade that they had got a treasure. 

Our hero was wholly devoted to his business. He 
intended to make a man of himself, and he could 
anly accomplish his purpose by constant exertion, by 
constant study, and constant " trying again." He 
was obliged to keep a close watch over himself, fot 
often ne was tempted to be idle and negligent, to be 
careless and indifferent. 

After supper, on Thursday evening of his second 
week at Wake and Wade's, he hastened to Majoi 
Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the 
cews from Rockville. His heart beat violently when 
be saw John's great wagon, forhedreaded some fear- 





ful announcement from his sick friend. He had nn t 
before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness 
to the little angel, as now, when she lay upon the 
bed of pain, perhaps of death. She had kindled in 
his soul a love for the good and the beautiful. She 
had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference 
between tne right and the wrong. In a word, she 
was the guiding star of his existence. Her approba- 
tion was to be the bright guerdon of fidelity to truth 
and principle. 

" How is Julia ? " asked Harry, without giving 
John time to inquire why he had left the stable. 
" They think she is a little grain better." 
" Then she is still living ? " continued Harry, a 
great load of anxiety removed from his soul. 

" She is ; but it is very doubtful how it will turn 
I went in to see her yesterday, and she spoke of 
vou." 

" Spoke of me ? " 

" She said she should like to see you." 
" I should like to see her very much." 
" Her father told me, if you was a mind to go ay 
to Rockville, he would pay y>ur expenses." 

" I don't mind the expenses. I will go. if I cab 
get away." 

*' Her father feels very bad about it. Julia is an 
only child, and he would do any thing in the world 
to please her." 

" I will go and see the gentlemen I work for, and 
if they will let me, I will go with you to-morrow 
morning." 

" Better take the stage; you will get there so much 
quicker." 

" I will do so, then." 

Harry returned home to ascertain of Edwaid where 
Mr. Wake lived, and hastened to see him. That 
gentleman, however, coldly assured him, if he went 
to Rockville, he must lose his place — they could 
not get along without a boy. Ir vain Harry urged 
that he should be gone but two days ; the senior was 
inflexible. 

" What shall I do ? " said he to himself, when he 
get into the street again. "Mr. Wake says, sie is 
xx j relation of mine, and he don't see why I should 
go. Poor Julia! She may die, and I shall ne^ej 
»ee her again. I must go." 




It did not require a gieat deal of deliberation to 
convince himself that it was his duty to visit the sick 
girl. She had been a true friend to him, i.z i he 
could afford to sacrifice his place to procure her even 
a slight gratification. Affection and duty called him 
one way, self-interest the other. If he did not go, 
he suould regret it as long as he lived. Perhaps Mr. 
Wake would take him again on his return ; if not, 
Le could at least go to work in the stable again. 

" Edward, I am going to Rockville to-morrow," he 
remarked to his " chum," on his return to Mrs. 
Flint's. 

" The old man agreed to it, then ? I thought he 
wouldn't. He never will let a fellow off even for a 
day." 

" He did not ; but I must go." 

" Better not, then. He will discharge you, for he 
is a hard nut '" 

" I must go," repeated Harry, taking a candle, and 
going up to their chamber. 

" You have got more spunk than I gave you credit 
for; but you are sure of losing your place," replied 
Edwaid, following him up stairs . 





" I can't help it." 

Harry opened a drawer in the old broken Imiean 
ir the room, and from beneath his clothes took out 
(he great pill box which served him for a savinga 
tank 

" You have got lots of money," remarked Edward, 
 he glanced at the contents of the box. 

" Not much ; only twelve dollars," replied Harry, 
iaking out three of them to pay his expenses to 
Rockville. 

" You won't leave that box there, will you, while 
fou are gone ? " 

" Why not ? " 

" Somebody may steal it." 

" I guess not. I can hide it, though, before I go." 

" Better do so." 

Harry took his money and went to a bookstore in 
Washington Street, where he purchased an appropriate present for Julia, for which he gave half a dollar. 
On his return, he wrote her name in it, with his own 
as the giver. Then t'^e safety of his money came up 
for consideration; and this matter was settled by 
raising a loose board in the floor, and depositing Kha 



pill box in a secure place. He had scarcely done so 
icfore Edward joined him. 

Our hero did not sleep much that night. He was 
not altogether satisfied with the step he was about to 
taka. It was not doing right by his employers ; but 
he compromised the matter in part by engaging Ed- 
ward, " for a consideration," to make the fires and 
sweep out the next morning. 

At noon, on the following day, he reached Rock- 
ville, and hastened to the house of Mr. Biyant. 

" How is she ? " he asked, breathless with interest, 
of the girl who answered his knock. 

" She is better to-day. Are you the boy from 
Boston ? " 

" Yes. Do they think she will get well ? " 

" The doctor has more hope of her." 

" I am very glad to hear it." 

Harry was conducted into the house, and Mr. Bry- 
ant was informed of his presence. 

" I am glad you have come, Harry. Julia is much 
better to-day," said her father, taking him by the 
hand " She has frequently spoken of you, during 
her illness, and feels a very strong interest in youi 
welfare." 





" She was very good to me. I don't know what 
would have tecorae of me if she had not been a friend 
to me." 

" That is the secret of her interest in you. We 
love those best whom we serve most. She is asleep 
now ; but you shall see her as soon as she wakes. 
In the mean time you had better have your dinner. 

Mr. Bryant looked very pale, and his eyes were 
reddened with weeping. Harry saw how much he 
nad suffered during the last fortnight ; but it seemed 
natural to him that he should suffer terribly at the 
thought of losing one so beautiful and precious as 
the little angel. 

He dined alone with Mr. Bryant, for Mrs. Bryant 
could not leave the couch of the little sufferer. The 
fond father could speak of nothing but Julia, and 
more than once the tears flooded his eyes, as he told 
Harry how meek and patient she had been through 
the fever, how loving she was, and how resigned 
even to leave her parents, and go to the heavenlv 
Parent, to dwell with him forever. 

Harry wept, too ; and after dinner, he most
feared to enter the chamber, and behold the wreck 




tthirh disease had made of that bright and beautiful 
form. Removing the wrapper from the book he had 
brought, — a volume of sweet poems, entitled " Angel 
Songs," — he followed Mr. Bryant into the sick gill's 
chamber. 

" Ah, Harry, I am delighted to s;>e you ! " ex- 
claimed she, in a whisper, for her diseased throat 
rendered articulation difficult and painful. 

" I am sorry to see you so sick, Julia," replied 
Harry, taking the wasted hand she extended to him. 

" I am better, Harry. I feel as though I should 
get well now." 

" I hope you will." 

" You don't know how much I have thought of 
you, while I lay here ; how I wished you were my 
brother, and could come in every day and see me," 
she continued, with a faint smile. 

" I wish I could." 

" Now tell me how you get along in Boston." 

" Very well ; but your father says I must not tulV 
much with you now. I have brought you a little 
jook ; " and he placed it in her hand. 

" Jiow gcod you are, Harry! 'Arjipl Songs. 





Hew pretty ! Now, Harry, you must read me on€ 
of the angel songs." 

" I will ; but I can't read very well," said he, as 
he opened the volume. 

But he did read exceedingly well. The piece he 
selected was a very pretty and a very touching littla 
song ; and Harry's feelings were so deeply moved by 
the pathetic sentiments of the poem and their adap- 
tation to the circumstances of the case, that he was 
quite eloquent. 

When he had finished, Mrs. Bryant interfered to 
prevent further conversation ; and Julia, though she 
had a great deal to say to her young friend, cheerful- 
ly yielded to her mother's wishes, and Harry reluc- 
tantly left the room. 

Towards night he was permitted to see her again, 
when he read several of the angel songs to her, and 
^ave her a brief account of the events of his resi- 
dence in Boston. She was pleased with his earnest- 
ness, and smiled approvingly upon him for the moral 
triumphs he had achieved. The reward of all his 
struggles with trial and temptation was lavishly be- 
stowed in her commendation, and if fidelity had not 




been its own reward, he could have accepted hex 
approval as abundant compensation for  all he had 
endured. There was no silly sentiment in Harry's 
composition ; he had read no novels, seen no piayfi, 
knew nothing of romance even " in real life." The 
nomage he yielded to the fair and loving girl was an 
unaffected reverence for simple purity and goodness; 
that which the True Heart and the True Life never 
fail to call forth wherever they exert their power. 

On the following morning, Julia's condition was 
very much improved, and the physician spoke confi- 
dently of a favorable issue. Harry was permitted to 
pend an hour by her bedside, inhaling the pure spirit 
that pervaded the soul of the sick one. She was so 
much better that her father proposed to visit the city, 
to attend to some urgent business, which had been 
long deferred by her illness ; and an opportunity was 
thus afforded for Harry to return. 

Mr. Bryant drove furiously in his haste, changing 
horses twice on tbe journey, so that they reached the 
city at one o'clock. On their arrival, Harry's atten« 
tion naturally turned to the reception he expected :o 
receive from his employers. He had no' spoker o? 

hia relations with them at Rockville, preferring not to 
pain them, on the one hand, and not to take too mwah 
credit to himself for his devotion to Julia, on the 
other. After the horse was disposed of at Major 
Phillips's stable, Mr. Bryant walked down town wifb 
Harry ; and when they reached the store of Wake 
and Wade, he entered with him. 

" What have you come back for ? " asked the 
senior partner, rather coldly, when he saw the delin- 
quent. " We don't want you." 

Harry was confused at this reception, though it waa 
nut unexpected. 

" I didn't know but that you might be willing ta 
take me again." 

" No, we don't want you. Ah, Mr. Bryant ? Hap- 
py to see you," continued Mr. Wake, recognizing 
Harry's friend. 

" Did I understand you aright ? Did you say tha< 
you did not want my young friend, here?" replied 
Mr. Bryant, taking the offered hand of Mr. Wake. 

" I did say so," said the senior. " I was not aware 
that he was your friend, though; " and he procerded 
tc inform Mr. Bryant, that Harry had left them 
tgainst their wish. 




" A few words with you, if you please." 

Mr. Wake conducted him to the private office, 
where they remained for half an hour. 

" It is all right, Harry," continued Mr. "Wake, on 
tLeir return. " I did not understand the matter." 

" Thank you, sir ! " ejaculated our hero, rejoiced 
to find his place was still secure. " I would not
have gone if I could possibly have helped it." 

" You did right, my boy, and I honor you for youl 
courage and constancy." 

Mr. Bryant bade him an affectionate adieu, pr>; min- 
ing to write to him often until Julia recovered, s»nd 
then departed. 

With a grateful heart Harry immediately resumed 
his duties, and the partners were probably as glad to 
retain him as he was to remain. 

At night, when he went to his chamber, he raised 
the loose board to get the pill box, containing his 
savings, in order to return the money he Lad not 
expended. To his consternation, he ibscjvered that 
it was gone ! 





It was in vain that Harry searched beneath the 
bnkin floor for his lost treasure; it could not be 
found. He raised the boards up, and satisfied himself that it had not slipped away into any crevice, or 
fallen through into the room below ; and the conclu- 
sion was inevitable that the box had been stolen. 

Who could have stolen it ? The mystery confused 
Harry ; for he was certain that no one had seen him 
deposit the box beneath the floor. No one except 
Edward even knew that he had any money. He was 
sure that neither Mrs. Flint nor Katy would have 
(stolen it ; and he was not willing to believe that bin 
room mate would be guilt j of such a mean and contemptible act. 



 

He tried to assure himself that it had not been 
stolen — that it was still somewhere beneath the 
tioor ; and he pulled up another hoard, to iesumi 
the search. He had scarcely done so before Edward 
joined him. 

" What are you about, Harry ? " he asked, appar- 
ently very much astonished at his chum's occupation 
" Are you going to pull the house down ? " 

" Not exactly. You know my pill box ? " replied 
Hurry, susoending operations to watch Edward' 
expression when he told him of his loss. 

" The one you kept your money in ? " 

" Yes. Well, it is gone." 

" Gone ! " exclaimed Edward, starting back with 
surprise . 

" It is either lost or. stolen." 

" What did you do with it ? " 

" Put it here, under this loose board." 

" It must be there now, then. I will help yoi 
find it." 

Edward manifested a great deal of enthusiasm ia 
the search. He was sure it must be where Harry 
had put it, <>r that it had rolled back out of sight; 





and he began tearing up the floor with a zeal that 
threaten ;d the destruction of the building. But ths 
box could not be found, and they were oblige to 
abandon the search. 

" Too bad, Harry." 

" That is a fact ; I can't spare that money, any 
how. I have been a good while earning it, and it is 
too thundering bad to lose it." 

" I don't understand it," continued Edward. 

" Nor I either," replied Harry, looking his com- 
panion sharp in the eye. " No one knew I had it 
but you." 

" Do you mean to say I stole it?" exclaimed Ed- 
ward, doubling his fist, while his cheek reddened 
with anger. 

" I don't say so." 

" Humph ! Well, you better not." 

" Don't get mad, Edward. I didn't mean to lay 
it to you." 

'' Didn't you ? " And Edward was very glad to 
have the matter compromised. 

" I did not ; perhaps I spoke hasti'y. You know 
how hard I worked for this money ; and it seem? 
hard to lose it. But no matter; I will try again." 




M/s Flint and Katy were much grieved ^hen 
If arry told of his loss. They looked as though they 
Busp?cted Edward; but they said nothing; for it waa 
very hard to accuse a son or a brother of such a 
crime. 

Mrs. Flint advised Harry to put his money in the 
savings bank in future, promising to take care of his
spare funds till they amounted to five dollars, which 
was then the smallest sum that would be received. 
It was a long time before our hero became reconciled 
to his loss. He had made up his mind to be a rich 
man ; and he had carefully hoarded every cent he 
could spare, thus closely imitating the man who got 
rich by saving his fourpences. 

A few days after the loss, he was reading in one 
of Katy's Sunday school books about a miser. The 
wretch was held up as a warning to young folks, by 
showing them how he starved his body and soul for  
the sake of gold. 

" That's why I lost my money ! " exclaimed Harry 
as he laid the book upon the window. 

" What do you mean, Harry ? " asked Katy, wb 
ft it near him. 





"I have been hoarding up my money just like thifl 
aid man in the book." 

'* You are not a miser, Harry. You couldn't be 
mean and stingy, if you tried." 

" Yes, I could. I love money." 

" So does every body." 

" A miser wouldn't do what you did for us, Harry,*' 
added Mrs. Flint. " We ought to be careful and 
saving." 

" I have been thinking too much of money. After 
all, perhaps it was just as well that I lost that 
money." 

" I am sorry you lost it ; for I don't think there 
is any danger of youi becoming a miser," said 
Kary. 

" Perhaps not ; at any rate, it has set me to 
thinking." 

Haiiy finished the book; and it was, fortunately, 
just such a work as he required to give him right 
and proper views in regard to the value of wealth. 
His dream of being a rich man was essentially modi- 
fied by these views ; and he renewedly resoh ed that 
it was better to be a good man than to be i rub. man, 




if ne could not be both. It seemed to him a little 
remarkable that the minister should preach upon this 
rery topic on the following Sunday, taking for his 
text thn words, " Seek ye first the kingdom of 
heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you." 
He wae deeply impressed by the sermon, probably 
because it was on a subject to which he had given 
some attention. 

A few days after his return from Rockville, Harry 
received a very cheerful letter from Mr. Bryant, to 
which Julia had added a few lines in a postscript. 
The little angel was rapidly recovering, and our hero 
was rejoiced beyond expression. The favorable ter- 
mination of her illness was a joy which far outbal- 
anced the loss of his money, and he was as cheerful 
and contented as ever. As he expressed it, in rather 
homely terms, he had got " the streak of fat and the 
streak of lean." Julia was alive ; was to smile upon 
him again : was still to inspire him with that love 
of goodness which had given her such an influence 
over him. 

Week after week passed by, and Harry heard nolh' 
mg of his lost treasure ; but Julia had fully recoT< 





ered, and for the treasure lost an incomparably greater 
treasure had been gained. Edward and himself con- 
tinued to occupy the same room, though ever since 
the loss of the money box Harry's chum had tieated 
him coldly. There had never been much sympathy 
between them ; for while Edward was at the theatre, 
or perhaps at worse places, Harry was at home, read- 
ing some good book, writing a letter to Rockville, or 
employed in some other worthy occupation. While 
Harry was at church or at the Sunday school, Ed- 
ward, in company with some dissolute companion, 
was riding about the adjacent country. 

Mrs. Flint often remonstrated with her son upon 
the life he led, and the dissipated habits he was con- 
tracting ; and several times Harry ventured to intro- 
duce the subject. Edward, however, would not hear 
a word from either. It is true that we either grow 
better or worse, as we advance in life ; and Fdward 
Flint's path was down a headlong steep. His mother 
wept, and begged him to be a better b *j. He only 
laughed at her. 

Harry often wondered how he could afford to ridfc 
out, and visit the theatre and other places of am ise* 



 

meat so frequently. His salary wis only five dollars 
a week now ; it was only four when he had *aid it 
was five. He seemed to have money at all times, 
and to spend it very freely. He could not help be- 
lieving that the contents of his pill box had paid for 
some of the " stews " and " Tom and Jerrys " which 
his reckless chum consumed. But the nine dollars 
he had lost would have been but a drop in the bucket 
compared with his extravagant outlays. 

One day, about six months after Harry's return 
from Kockville, as he was engaged behind the coun- 
ter, a young man entered the store, and accosted him 

" Halloo, Harry ! How are you ? " 

It was a familiar voice ; and, to Harry's surprise, 
but not much to his satisfaction, he recognized his 
old companion, Ben Smart, who, he had learned Irora 
Mr. Bryant, had been sent to the house ul correction 
for burning Squire Walker's barn. 

"How dc you do, Ben?" returned Harry, not verj 
cerdiady. 

" So you are here — are you ? " 

" Yes, I have been here this &ix months." 

" Good place ? " 




" Firsi rate." 

i: Any chance for me ? " 

" No. I gueas not." 

" You have got a sign out for a boy, I spe." 

It was true they had. There were more errands 
to run than one boy could attend to ; besides, Harry 
had proved himself so faithful and so intelligent, that 
Mr. Wake wished to retain him in the store, to fit 
him for a salesman. 

" You can speak a good word for me, Harry ; for 
I should like to work here," continued Ben. 

" I thought you were in — in the " 

Harry did not like to use the offensive expression ; 
and Ben's face darkened when he discovered what 
the other was going to say. 

" Not a word about that," said he. " If you ever 
mention that little matter, I'll take your life." 

" But how was it? " 

" My father got me out, and then I ran away. Not 
& word more, for I had as lief be hung for an ol J 
sheep as a lamb." 

" There is Mr. Wake ; you can apply to him," 
continued H-irry. 



 

Ben walked boldly up to Mr. Wake, and asked 
for the place, The senior talked with him a few 
moments, and then retired to his private office, call- 
ing Harry as ho entered. 

" If you say any thing, I will be the death of you,' 
whispered Ben, as Harry passed him on his way to 
the office. 

Our hero was not particularly pleased with thes* 
threats ; he certainly was not frightened by them. 

" Do you know that boy, Harry ? " asked Mr. 
Wakp, as he presented himself before the senior. 

" I do, sir." 

" Who is he, and what is he ? " 

" His name is Benjamin Smart. He belongs to 
Redfield." 

' To Redfield ? He said he came from Worces- 
ter." 

" I believe Mr. Bryant told you the story about mj 
levring Redfield," said Harry. 

" He did." 

" That is the boy that run away with me." 

" And the one that set the barn afire ? * 

« ; Yea, sir." 





" That is enough." And Harry returned to his 
work at the counter. 

" What did he say to you ? " asked Ben. 

Before Harry had time to make any reply, Mr. 
Wake joined them. 

" We don't want you, young man," said he. 

With a glance of hatred at Harry, the applicant 
left the store. Since leaving Redfield, our hero's 
views of duty had undergone a change ; and he now 
realized that to screen a wicked person was to plot 
with him against the good order of society. He 
knew Ben's character ; he had no reason, after theii 
interview, to suppose it was changed ; and he could 
not wrong his employers by permitting them igno- 
rantly to engage a bad boy, especially when he had 
been questioned directly on the point. 

Towards evening, Harry was sent with a bundle 
to a place in Boylston Street, which required him to 
cross the Common. On his return, when he reached 
the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who 
had evidently followed him, and lay in wait at this 
spot for him, sprang from his covert upon him. The 
young villain struck him a heavj blow in the eye 




before Harry realized his purpose. The blow, how- 
ever, was vigorously returned ; but Ben, besides 
oeing larger and stronger than his victim, had a 
large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a 
blow on the side of the head, knocking him insensi- 
ble to the ground. 

The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled 
along the side of the walk of the burying ground, 
pursued by several persons who had witnessed the 
assault. Ben was a fleet runner this time, and suc- 
ceeded in making his escape. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

IH WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEM 
HEAD MAT BE OF SOME USE TO A PERSON. 

When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found 
dimself in an elegantly furnished chamber, with sev- 
eral persons standing around the bed upon which he 
had been laid. A physician was bending over him, 
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received 
in the side of his head.
