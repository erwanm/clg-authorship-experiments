Nelly acknowledged with a slight bow the honor of a 
remark addressed exclusively to herself. She glanced 
at Maud, who seemed to be in the same position on the 
ottoman that she was an hour ago ; but in her eyes there 
was a very weary look. 

" Doctor," began Miss Grove presently, " your mother 
and I have been discussing another point, which we refer 
to you. Of course, you will have some kind of a recep 
tion to introduce Mrs. Kinnard into her new sphere. 
What do you say to next Wednesday evening?" 

Dr. Kinnard looked helplessly at his new wife. 

"Is it necessary? Do }^ou care, Nelly? " 

"Necessary!" echoed Miss Grove indignantly. 
" Why, yes, unless a man marries a woman of whom he 
is ashamed." 

" Then let us have it, by all means. Next week 
Wednesdaj'. I must remember and not make any en 
gagement. There must be some kind of supper, I sup 
pose ? And what else ? Dancing, and all that fol-de-rol ? " 

" If Mrs. Kinnard desires dancing. I do not dance 
myself," was the severe rejoinder. 

' ' I think a simple wedding-reception with a supper 
would be the best," said Nelly quietly. "It is always 
pleasant to know the people among whom one's lot is 
cast." 

' ' There is some very good society at Edgerly and 
Westwood, though, no doubt, quite different from the 
narrow bounds of a single parish," said Miss Grove. 

" Our parish bounds were not very narrow," was the 
gentle reply. 

" Excuse me, I have alwaj-s heard that Episcopalians 
were exceedingly exclusive. Of course, Mrs. Kinnard, 

 

you will make your first appearance in your husband's 
church, as we have a famity pew. And really, I believe 
the Episcopalians have not gained much of a foothold 
here. The old church is at the extreme end of the town, 
and is not considered at all fashionable." 

"Adelaide, we were discussing the party, if you 
please," said the doctor pointedly. "Will you take 
the management of it ? There are a few people whom I 
would like to ask. And, Nelty, I think you must send 
for Daisy. And will you," glancing at Miss Grove, 
" learn what will be needed, and let Mat order it?" 

" Certainly, since you put it into my hands. Then we 
will say Wednesday evening of next week. I shall write 
the invitations myself, as they are considered much more 
stjiish. You can hand me your list to-morrow. Is that 
nine? Maud, we must say good-evening, and retire. 
Mrs. Kinnard, breakfast is at eight, dinner at half-past 
twelve, and supper at six, invariably, whether the doctor 
is here or not. Irregular meals betoken a very careless 
household, in my estimation ; and there is nothing like 
system for young people. Say good- night, Maud." 

The elder lady bowed with sweeping stiffness, and 
Maud with almost comical primness. No tender good 
night kiss, no cordial wishes. The doctor gave a care 
less nod, as if he was glad to be rid of them thus easily. 
Then he turned to his mother, and began to make some 
casual inquiries as to what had transpired in his absence. 

Mrs. Kinnard, senior, had been scrutinizing the pretty 
doll her son had so foolishly married. Oddly enough, 
from her first entrance as an inmate of her son's house, 
she had been afraid he would marry Adelaide Grove. 
Both women had tried hard for the supremacy ; but Miss 
Grove kept that over the children, and the rule of the 
household, in some degree. But when his engagement to 
that designing young flirt, Miss Endicott, was announced, 
his mother was astounded. 



 

"Barton," she said, "there is no need whatever of 
your marrying again. Adelaide can look after the chil 
dren ; and I can supervise the house. You will find that 
you are plunging yourself into a sea of trouble. But, if 
you must marry, Adelaide would be so much more suita 
ble. She is nearer to the children than any stranger can 
be ; she is experienced, and" 

But Mrs. Kinnard was not suffered to recount the 
newty discovered virtues of Adelaide Grove. 

"Mother," said Dr. Kinnard, with a solemnity that 
effectually hushed caviling, "I pleased you years ago 
by marrjing Mary Grove : now I shall please myself by 
marrying Nelly Endicott. As for the children, in their 
own mother's lifetime they were left to the care of ser 
vants and Aunt Adelaide. When they are old enough, I 
shall send them away to school. Miss Endicott has been 
brought up amongst children ; and, if I were to die in a 
year's time, I could leave mine in no better hands. I 
hope you will love and welcome her as a daughter ; but 
I am marrying her for nr^self alone." 

Mrs. Kinnard was awed by her son's manner ; and she 
admitted to herself that he was of an obstinate turn. 
But now she fancied that it really had been the desire of 
her life, instead of the dread, that Adelaide should fill 
this position. So the two women formed a tacit league, 
cemented by mutual disappointment. If Dr. Kinnard 
had not married at all, Miss Grove would have been 
satisfied ; but that he should dare to choose youth and 
beauty in preference to experience and money was an 
insult. Since she could not venture to retaliate upon 
him, she nursed her indignation, and kept it warm for 
the new-comer. 

Nelly understood, and was chilled by the coldness. 
She tried to keep up a little conversation ; but it was 
difficult. Dr. Kinnard was annoyed by his mother's 
want of cordiality, yet he felt that some excuse was due 





her age, and that, at her time of life, people did not readily 
adapt themselves to changes. But it was so different at 
the rectory ! That atmosphere of love, and frank, unaf 
fected gayety, had in it such an air of wholesome, winning 
warmth ; it so soon broke through the crust of selfish 
reserve ; it gave so freely of its best, making a contin 
ual feast, alike for the chosen guest, the wayfarer, and 
the home-circle. 

It was a relief when the elder lady retired. Aunt Ade 
laide had not condescended to make a second appearance. 

Nelly drew a long breath. Dr. Kinnard roused him 
self from a mood of though tfulness. 

" I daresay you are tired to death. I'll take a look in 
the office, and then we will go up stairs." 

" Oh ! let me go with you. I want to see your den ; " 
and Nelly's face was so animated and eager, that he 
smiled fondly. 

" Come along, then. I'll call Jane to shut up the 
parlor. It's a dreary place to me: parlors alwaj-s are 
except yours at the rectory." 

" That was hardly a parlor. Do you know I like the 
old term so much better, drawing-room ? It seems as 
if people might draw together from mutual interest and 
sympathy ; but the word ' parlor ' makes me think of a 
room handsomely furnished, and darkened to sombreness, 
where you receive ceremonious calls." 

He laughed. They had crossed the hall ; and, finding 
the door locked, he said, 

" I will go around and open it. Nay, don't come. 
You'll break your neck over the rubbish." 

She had learned in her month of honej^moon that Dr. 
Kinnard was prompt to exact obedience in little things. It 
fretted him to have a person disregard his orders, and do 
something a little different, when the first request would 
have been no more trouble. There was no foolish pride 
on Nelly's part ; perhaps because her mother had set that 





noblest of all examples, obedience. There had been 
a certain riotous lawlessness at the rectory, though it was 
more exuberance of spirit than any positive disregard of 
authority. 

" I have kept you waiting," he said in apology. " My 
lamp was not in perfect order. This is my office. Does 
it wear a formidable aspect ? ' ' 

" On the contrary, I think it the most homelike place 
I have seen. Why, you are a very king here," she said 
gayly. 

The room was large, with three windows across the 
front, and a side-entrance leading out on a smaller porch, 
much used by the doctor and his patients. On the hall- 
side it was filled with book-shelves, with the exception of 
the doorway, and also the corner by the chimney. On 
the opposite side stood a great Turkish lounge, covered 
in russet leather, and several capacious arm-chairs. The 
carpet was soft, and in rich, subdued colors. There was 
a large table in the centre, covered with books and pam 
phlets, and just over this a swinging-lamp, with a white 
porcelain shade. Then there were pictures, brackets, 
busts, antique vases, and various odds and ends, that 
only a man with a peculiar and cultivated taste would be 
likely to collect. 

"And this is my 'den.' It is in confusion now; for 
Adelaide sent down some of the things that used to be in 
the sleeping-room." 

" I thought that looked exceedingly bare and prim," 
Nelly said mirthfully. "May I not make a raid, and 
reclaim some of them? or do you delight in confusion?" 

"Well, not exactly. You see, the women are forbidden 
this part of the house. I like Mat's care better. He 
does not stow articles away in unheard-of places, and then 
argue an hour concerning the fitness and propriety of it." 

Nelly had too much wisdom to resent the exclusion of 
the family in general. Yet a kind of nearness and home- 



 

feeling was established at once between her and the 
rooms. This one contained an odd collection, a large 
piece of furniture, not unlike an old-fashioned mahogany 
sideboard, with capacious closets at the bottom, and sev 
eral rather curiously carved shelves at the top, on which 
was a promiscuous collection ; a wardrobe ; a roomy 
writing-desk ; and a great square-cornered sofa, where one 
might sleep very comfortably indeed. 

" You see," went on the doctor in an explanatory 
manner, " I do sleep here a great deal. Mother, Aunt 
Adelaide, and the children have the rooms over opposite. 
There is a stairway here, which leads to the room above : 
so you see, by that means, I keep quite to myself. That 
connects again with the spare chamber, our room." 

" Then I can visit you without any trouble, as I foresee 
already that I shall take a great fancy to this ' den ' of 
yours. Do not be surprised if I bring a work-basket and 
a rocking-chair, and make myself at home." 

He shrugged his shoulders, and bestowed upon her a 
humorous smile. 

"Will you allow me to light a cigar, Mrs. Kinnard? 
I am full of confirmed bachelor-habits ; and I cannot 
give up the privileges of this den." 

She nodded a gay little assent. He came and sat down 
on the sofa, put his arm around her, and drew her nearer 
to him. It was so strange, and yet so delightful, to have 
some one to pet ; though there was an occasional shy 
awkwardness that amused Nelly. 

" I hope you will soon get to feeling at home," he 
began presently. 

' ' I shall do my best. And if they will all love me a 
little" 

" Will not my love satisfy? " 

" But have I not taken upon myself duties towards 
the others as well? The children " 

" Aunt Adelaide is to teach them, for the present. 





When they are a little older, I shall pack them off to 
school." 

It sounded so hard and unsympathetic to her, fresh 
from a centre of family affection. It would be an easy 
way of solving the difficulty, no doubt. 

" I cannot help but think that home is the best place 
for a girl ; that is, if it is the right kind of a home." 

" Exactly, Nelly. But, with all due deference to your 
loving and generous heart, I think a few weeks will con 
vince you that there are some very inharmonious influ 
ences here, and that this cannot truly be called a model 
home. Maud, as you must have seen to-night, is a per 
fect little prig. I don't complain of her quiet, or her 
nice manners, but the primness, and air of consequence. 
She knows that when she is of age she will have quite a 
little fortune. The money their mother left was invested, 
and will not be touched until then. Bertie is rough in 
many waj's, and has serious faults ; but I have insisted 
that he should not be clipped and trained into a Miss 
Nancy. I cannot abide girlish boys. Aunt Adelaide has 
queer notions, and is sure her way is best and right." 

' ' Must she have charge of the children ? ' ' asked Nelly 
timidly. 

"I couldn't well send her away. She came here at 
Bertie's birth ; and she was needed sorely enough, God 
knows. She was very different from the children's 
mother. After her death, she took sole charge of them ; 
and I must admit they have not lacked any material 
comfort. I daresay you have discovered by this time, 
Nelly, that I am not extravagantly fond of children." 

She had, indeed. She saw how very easily she could 
crowd them out of their father's heart. 

" I suppose it is a fault. While I could never beat or 
starve a little child, or thwart it of any needful pleasure, 
still children do not interest me as a book or an educated 
companion does. Therefore I was relieved to have Aunt 





Adelaide take them so completely off my hands. And 
I felt it would be really ungenerous to refuse her a year 
or two more, because I had consulted my own pleasure in 
marrying you." 

" You were quite right there, I think. It would have 
been very hard." 

" You see, I never expected to marry. But at last I 
began to long for a little dark-eyed witch, my neighbor's 
daughter ; and my resolves were scattered to the winds." 

' ' And if you should repent ? " 

"Nelly, you must not let me!" and he pressed her 
closer, with a vehement clasp. U I am not fickle or 
unreasonable in my demands, queer, I may be. Can't 
you take some of the quirks out of me? not b}^ any 
sudden wrenching-off, but the gentler treatment, when a 
man's vanity is not wounded, and he doesn't realize that 
he is being managed. I think there may be some good 
traits in my nature ; but they have been overlaid with 
rubbish of all sorts." 

" It will be my first entertaining duty to go on a 
volage of discovery," she answered playfully. 

"What were we talking of? Oh! Aunt Adelaide. 
Well, j'ou see at this juncture, I could not well send 
her away, or refuse her the oversight of her sister's 
children for a while longer. But when they go to school, 
ah, Nelly, I have solved the puzzle ! " and he laughed 
heartily, in his mellow, wholesome manner. 

"You will prescribe matrimony? Ah, you see I am 
good at guessing ; " and she gave an audacious little smile. 

' ' But who will bell the cat ? " and an expression of 
comical anxiety pervaded his face. 

"Ah! your expedient has one weak side. No doubt 
there are men who would be only too glad to take Miss 
Grove and her money ; but she is too wise a woman to 
make a very poor bargain. And she may have had 
some " 





"Love-episode, you think? No: I don't believe her 
heart is in any one's grave. But we must make the best 
of her as she is ; and you must not feel hurt, my darling, 
at any coldness or reserve on her part." 

He pressed his young wife to his heart. She was 
prett}?- and sweet, and had that beguiling way of womanly 
wisdom which enchanted him, while he had not abounding 
faith in it. He had seen so much of life, of women, of 
matrimony, that sometimes he was tempted to scoff a 
little. And yet he felt, that, for the first time, a true and 
simple love had blossomed in his pathway. No one 
should snatch it from him : he even hated to think that 
any one should share it. With the unreasonableness of 
a man's strong and imperious passion, he half wished 
they could go away by themselves, and shut out the rest 
of the world. 



CHAPTER V. 

" He that hath a victory lost 
May discomfit yet a host ; 
And it often doth befall, 
He who conquers loses all." 

NELLY slept late the next morning, and had just time to 
hurry down to breakfast. Jane was inexorable about the 
meals, as far as the family were concerned, and agreed 
famously on this point with Miss Adelaide ; but to the 
master she was all indulgence. She would leave any 
work to spread a dainty feast for him. She had not ap 
proved of this marriage. 

' ' It's a foolish thing ; and the doctor will be sorry 
enough when he comes to his senses," she said to Mat on 
the wedding-day. "But men never do know when they 
are well off. I'm not going to have any pert young thing 
ordering around in my kitchen, I can tell you ! " 

So when Jane met her in the hall, in the bloom and 
freshness of her youth, and her pretty white morning- 
dress, with roses at her throat, leaning so familiarly on 
the arm of the doctor (whom she respected to the utter 
most, and really felt a little afraid of) , a frown darkened 
her face. 

The rest were in their places. Maud looked thinner 
and more sallow in her yellowish brown-linen dress, elab 
orately embroidered with black, the ruffle of the same 
not relieved in the slightest. Both children responded 
rather shyly to Nelly's joyous good-morning. The ladies 
made a few commonplace comments ; the doctor talked a 
 





little business ; and the meal was hurried through. Out 
side, countless roses were blooming ; but not one graced 
the table or the apartment. 

' ' Will you give me the list of people whom you would 
like invited next week ? " asked Miss Grove, as she rose. 

"Yes. Nelly, come in the office a moment, will you?" 
and the doctor placed his hand on her shoulder. 

Maud stared. So did Jane, who had just entered to 
remove the breakfast-dishes. Asked in the office, where 
no one else was tolerated ! 

Nelly followed, unconscious of the great favor. 

Mrs. Kiunard turned to Miss Grove. " What shall we 
order for dinner to-day?" She always consulted Miss 
Grove, though at first she had made a great effort to get 
the supreme power in her hands. She looked after the 
house, did the mending, and was the intermediate link 
between Jane and Miss Grove. 

All parties would have been still further scandalized 
had they seen the doctor kiss Nelly's peachy cheek, and 
turn her around in undisguised admiration. 

" Now, my dear girl, if you will sit down and scribble 
off a list of names for me, "while I look over a few busi 
ness matters. I ought to have done it last night, instead 
of making love to you ; and there will be no rest for 
Aunt Adelaide until this party is well under way." 

" And you don't like parties? " 

"Who said I didn't, eh? I am not quite an old bear! 
There will be some pleasant people, whom I really do 
want you to know. And it is the fashion, I suppose. 
The part I shall not enjoy is the being up on exhibition. 
But, if people will dance, they must pay the piper." 

Nelly smiled, and said she was ready. 

Dr. Kinnard repeated a few names, and then lost him 
self in some perplexing figures. Rousing suddenly, and 
seeing Nelly in an expectant attitude, he went on, with 
sundry breaks, until the list was finished. 





He ran his eyes over it. "I daresay it will vex Aunt 
Adelaide a little ; but I want some of my friends as well. 
Now run and get yourself ready, and we will go in town." 

Nelly made her bed, dusted her antique furniture, ex 
plored her closets, hung up a few dresses, and then put 
on her pretty silvery gray suit. She laid her hat and 
gloves on the bed, and sat down by the window to wait, 
espying. Bertie off in the distance, climbing a fence. 
The scene was delightful, varied by little hills with breaks 
between, and the river winding about in the distance. 
Presently a bell rang that set Nelly to wondering. 

It was for Herbert, but had to be rung sharply a second 
time. Then he came hurrying up the steps in a noisy 
fashion. 

"Herbert," said his aunt, "go down stairs, and come 
up as a gentleman should. I am ashamed of you this 
morning. Ever since you have been allowed to go over 
in the woods, you have grown wilder and ruder." 

He came up, and the door was closed. Nelly was tired 
of her lonely idleness, and began to unpack a few articles. 
What a dreary look the room had, and the parlor down 
stairs ! Would she ever feel at home ? Would she ever 
dare to say, "Mother" to Mrs. Kinnard. She winked 
a tear out of the corner of her eye. And here were her 
pretty vases and ornaments, bridal gifts some of them. 
She would have the brackets put up ; and, when the new 
furniture came, her room should be bright and cheerful. 

" Nelly," called the doctor ; and she ran down. 

" Here is one of my good friends, to whom I want to 
introduce you, Judge Denslow." 

Nelly bowed to a short, stout, fresh-colored, and good- 
humored person ; and there followed a little pleasantry, 
with congratulations. 

" Are you out for a morning-walk?" noticing her hat. 

" Oh, no ! I " and Nelly looked at her husband with 
a sudden flush. 





" I was to take her out," interposed the doctor. 

" Really, Mrs. Kinnard, you have made a good begin 
ning. Now, I always have to wait for my women-folks. 
The sex, as a general thing, is half an hour behindhand." 

"That is something of a libel. TSay the exceptions 
are," she returned. 

"It wouldn't do for me to go back on my word, you 
see: I should lose weight;" and there was a mirthful 
twinkle in his eye. 

Another interruption occurred. " The doctor was 
wanted right away at Mis' Gale's. Mr. Gale had been in 
cramps all night. They only heard an hour ago that the 
doctor was home. The wagon was here, and he could go 
right back." 

"Very well: I won't be long, Nelly. Don't hurry 
off, judge;" and, seizing his hat, the doctor vanished. 
Judge Denslow remained a while longer, then made his 
adieus. Nelly looked over the books, straightened a pic 
ture, dusted the furniture, and gave an air of tidiness to 
the place, without any officious meddling or neatness. 
Then she glanced in the " den." How she should like to 
take some nice quiet da}", ah ! all days would be quiet 
enough here, and make this room pretty and homelike ! 
She had an inward famry that she should use it a great 
deal. The sitting-room did not look very cosey or invit 
ing ; and there was no other refuge beside her own 
apartment. She could sew here, and read ; and, her hus 
band would have a welcome smile the instant he entered 
the house. 

He rushed in then. "Oh, here you are ! v . he cried 
in a quick tone. " I was detained longer than I expected. 
Mat has Dolly all ready : so come along." 

With that he hurried her out, and packed her into the 
buggy ; and in a minute they were spinning down the 
road. She thought about the list of invitations that was 
lying on the study-table ; but she would not annoy him 
now by speaking of it. 

There were a few calls on the way ; and several friends 
came out to the carriage to see the doctor's new wife. His 
marriage had taken Edgerly quite by surprise ; because 
most people, if they thought about it at all, fancied he 
would end by marrying Miss Grove. 

Edgerly was a rather pretty town, being built partly on 
the side-hill, where the rows of cottages and terraced 
gardens reminded Nelly of a Swiss picture. The business 
streets wore a brisk air, with their stores and offices, and 
the continual passing of pedestrians. 

"We haven't said a word about what we want," ex 
claimed the doctor suddenly. " I don't believe I know 
much about such affairs. I never furnished a room in my 
life. When it is done, I can tell whether I like it or 
not." 

"You mean to refurnish it completely?" asked Nelly 
rather timidly. 

" Why, of course. We must have something that 
looks a little more like jon. We need a pretty carpet to 
begin with ; and here is just the place." 

So they went in ; and the clerks displayed their wares 
with alacrity. For a moment an odd misgiving crossed 
Nelly's mind. How rich was Dr. Kinnard, and ought she 
to buy a beautiful Brussels carpet for her sleeping-room ? 
But the doctor tumbled them over, examined, and finally 
narrowed the choice to three, all of which were unusually 
pretty, Nelry thought : so her scruples went to the winds, 
and she made her selection. 

"And now for some furniture. Nelly, I suppose you 
have a woman's love for the regulation black walnut ? " 

" I really do not know," was the slow reply. 

" Perhaps I associate it a great deal with sickness," he 
said. " But, in spite of its richness, it has a gloomy look 
to me, as if it was more fit for dowagers than young 
wives. I am a queer old fellow, am I not?" 

Nelly smiled, and resolved that the room should be 



 

light and bright. After some search, they found a suit to 
their taste, and ordered it. 

" Upon my word," declared the doctor, " you must be 
an exception in shopping. Here we are all through, and 
with some time still on our hands. Let me see we can 
drop into the library ; and I will introduce you to Mr. 
Grey. And there is quite a pretty picture-store, where 
I have fallen into the bad habit of idling away my time. 
It will not look quite so grand after our city experiences ; 
but now we have come back to plain country-life." 

Nelly thought of the dinner, and would not allow him 
to loiter so much to-day. But then he wanted to show 
her one of his favorite drives, and it was the longest ~wa,y 
home. The family were seated around the table, and the 
dessert had been brought on. 

" You left no word," began Miss Grove ; " and I do 
endeavor to make my own and the children's habits 
regular." 

"Oh, that is all right enough!" he replied, as Nelly 
went to take off her hat and gloves. Then he glanced 
over the table. "Has anything been kept warm?" he 
asked. 

"How could Jane, when she did not know what time 
you might be expected ? " was the reply, in a complaining 
tone. 

Nelly returned at that moment, and took her seat beside 
her husband. Miss Grove sat at the head of the table, 
with a child on either hand. Dr. Kinnard was a trifle 
touched and mortified to have Nelly crowded into a 
secondary place. She ought to be mistress. And this 
cold meat wasi not very inviting, carved half an hour ago, 
nor the lukewarm vegetables. But, while he was con 
sidering, an imperative summons came for him. 

"I must go straight to Lakeland," he said; " and I 
may not be back until evening." Then he lapsed into 
silence and hurried eating ; while Mrs. Kinnard and Miss 
Grove kept up a small stream of neighborhood gossip. 





Nelly followed him to the office, and made her adieus 
out of the reach of prying eyes. 

"Don't get lonesome, little girl. I wish I could take 
you ; but I cannot now. Good-by." 

She had not the courage to go back and finish her des 
sert, though she admitted rather grimly to herself that 
she was still hungry. Bertie had half an hour for play at 
noon; while Maud 'went to her music-practice. Nelly 
retired to her room, and settled a few more articles in the 
pantry. Then she bethought herself of letters to write ; 
and she had a presentiment that she could write better 
now than when she came to have more experience with 
the household, since at present she could judge them as 
strangers. 

She went down to the office, and ensconced herself in 
an easy-chair, finding so much to say, that the time passed 
rapidly. Once her attention was aroused by a prettj r 
pony-phaeton being driven to the door. Aunt Adelaide 
and Maud stepped off the porch, and took their seats. 
Then the house grew lonesomely quiet ; for Bertie had 
gone out to play. After her letters were finished, she 
took a short walk, but met no one. Even Mrs. Kinnard 
did not seem to be visible anywhere. She was thapkful 
to hear the tea-bell ring, though she felt something like 
an interloper, as she went out alone. 

" Did you have a pleasant drive this afternoon, Maud," 
she asked, when the silence grew oppressive. 

Maud glanced at Aunt Adelaide ; then, pursing up he r 
mouth, replied that it was pleasant. 

" And you are very fond of it, I daresay. The pony 
and phaeton are a perfect match." 

" They are Aunt Adelaide's," volunteered Bertie. 

" Herbert ! " said his aunt warningly'. 

 ' I suppose you would like to have a pony of your very 
own, Bertie?" Nelly ventured in a friendly tone, desirous 
of being social with some one. 





" You bet ! " was the eager, boyish reply. 

"Herbert, leave the table immediately. How often 
have I told yOU that I will not tolerate slang ; and this is 
the second time I have had to speak to you," said his 
annt in a severe tone. 

"O Miss Grove! allow me to intercede for him," 
exclaimed Nelly, blushing like a culprit herself; and 
Bertie hesitated a moment, with his eyes fixed upon 
her. 

' ' Herbert, you will go straight to bed for this disobe 
dience. I shall come up to your room presently. Mrs. 
Kinnard, I beg leave to explain that I have the care of 
these motherless children. Your good sense will show 
you that any interference is not only injudicious, but quite 
unfortunate in regard to them. Too many masters end 
by spoiling the child, as I have explained to the doctor ;
