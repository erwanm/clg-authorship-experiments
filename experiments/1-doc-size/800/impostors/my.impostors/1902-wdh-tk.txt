plate and rose. 

" Oh, Miss Kenton !" he penitently entreated. 

But she was down the slanting aisle and out of 
the reeling door before he could decide what to do. 



XI 



IT seemed to Breckon that he had passed through 
one of those accessions of temperament, one of those 
crises of natural man, to put it in the terms of an 
older theology than he professed, that might justify 
him in recurring to his original sense of his unfit- 
ness for his sacred calling, as he would hardly have 
called it. He had allowed his levity to get the bet 
ter of his sympathy, and his love of teasing to 
overpower that love of helping which seemed to 
him his chief right and reason for being a minis 
ter. To play a sort of poor practical joke upon that 
melancholy girl (who was also so attractive) was 
not merely unbecoming to him as a minister ; it was 
cruel; it was vulgar; it was ungentlemanly. He 
could not say less than ungentlemanly, for that 
seemed to give him the only pang that did him 
any good. Her absolute sincerity had made her 
such an easy prey that he ought to have shrunk 
from the shabby temptation in abhorrence. 

It is the privilege of a woman, whether she wills 
it or not, to put a man who is in the wrong con 
cerning her much further in the wrong than he 
could be from his offence. Breckon did not know 



 

whether he was suffering more or less because he 
was suffering quite hopelessly, but he was sure that 
he was suffering justly, and he was rather glad, 
if anything, that he must go on suffering. His 
first impulse had been to go at once to Judge Ken- 
ton and own his wrong, and take the consequences 
in fact, invite them. But Breckon forbore for 
two reasons: one, that he had already appeared 
before the judge with the confession of having pos 
sibly made an unclerical joke to his younger daugh 
ter; the other, that the judge might not consider 
levity towards the elder so venial; and though 
Breckon wished to be both punished and pardon 
ed, in the final analysis, perhaps, he most wished 
to be pardoned. Without pardon he could see no 
way to repair the wrong he had done. Perhaps he 
wished even to retrieve himself in the girl 's eyes, 
or wished for the chance of trying. 

Ellen went away to her state-room and sat down 
on the sofa opposite Lottie, and she lost herself 
in a muse in which she was found by the voice of 
the sufferer in the berth. 

"If you haven 't got anything better to do than 
come in here and stare at me, I wish you would go 
somewhere else and stare. I can tell you it isn 't 
any joke." 

" I didn 't know I was staring at you," said Ellen, 
humbly. 

" It would be enough to have you rising and sink 
ing there, without your staring at all. If you 're 
going to stay, I wish you d lie down. I don 't see 



 

why you 're so well, anyway, after getting us all 
to come on this wild-goose chase." 

"I know, I know," Ellen strickenly deprecated. 
"But I 'm not going to stay. I just came for my 
things." 

" Is that giggling simpleton sick ? I hope he is !" 

"Mr. Breckon?" Ellen asked, though she knew 
whom Lottie meant. " No, he isn 't sick. He was 
at lunch." 

" Was poppa ?" 

" He was at breakfast." 

" And momma ?" 

" She and Boyne are both in bed. I don 't know 
whether they 're very sick." 

" Well, then, I 'll just tell you what, Ellen Ken- 
ton!" Lottie sat up in accusal. "You were star 
ing at something he said; and the first thing we 
all know it will be another case of Bittridge!" 
Ellen winced, but Lottie had no pity. " You don 't 
know it, because you don 't know anything, and I 'm 
not blaming you; but if you let that simpleton 
I don 't care if he is a minister! go round with 
you when your family are all sick abed, you 'll be 
having the whole ship to look after you." 

"Be still, Lottie!" cried Ellen. "You are- 
awful," and, with a flaming face, she escaped from 
the state-room. 

She did not know where else to go, and she beat 
along the sides of the corridor as far as the dining- 
saloon. She had a dim notion of trying to go up 
into the music-room above, but a glance at the reel- 



 

ing steep of the stairs forbade. With her wraps 
on her arm and her sea-cap in her hand, she stood 
clinging to the rail-post. 

Breckon came out of the saloon. " Oh, Miss 
Kenton," he humbly entreated, " don 't try to go on 
deck ! It 's rougher than ever." 

" I was going to the music-room," she faltered. 

"Let me help you, then," he said again. They 
mounted the gangway-steps, but this time with his 
hand under her elbow, and his arm alert as before 
in a suspended embrace against her falling. 

She had lost the initiative of her earlier advent 
ure; she could only submit herself to his guidance. 
But he almost outdid her in meekness, when he 
got her safely placed in a corner whence she could 
not be easily flung upon the floor. " You must have 
found it very stuffy below; but, indeed, you d bet 
ter not try going out." 

" Do you think it isn 't safe here ?" she asked. 

" Oh yes. As long as you keep quiet. May I 
get you something to read? They seem to have a 
pretty good little library." 

They both glanced at the case of books, from 
which the steward-librarian was setting them the 
example of reading a volume. 

"No, I don 't want to read. You musn 't let me 
keep you from it." 

"Well, one can read any time. But one hasn 't 
always the chance to say that one is ashamed. Don 't 
pretend you don 't understand, Miss Kenton! I 
didn 't really mean anything. The temptation to 


let you exaggerate my disability was too much for 
me. Say that you despise me ! It would be such a 
comfort." 

"Weren 't you hurt?" 

"A little a little more than a little, but not 
half so much as I deserved not to the point of not 
being able to cut up my meat. Am I forgiven? 
I 'll promise to cut up all your meat for you at 
dinner ! Ah, I 'm making it worse !" 

" Oh no. Please don 't speak of it." 

" Could you forbid my thinking of it, too ?" He 
did not wait for her to answer. " Then here goes ! 
One, two, three, and the thought is banished for 
ever. Now what shall we speak of, or think of? 
We finished up the weather pretty thoroughly this 
morning. And if you have not the weather and 
the ship 's run when you 're at sea, why, you are at 
sea. Don 't you think it would be a good plan, when 
they stick those little flags into the chart, to show 
how far we ve come in the last twenty-four hours, 
if they d supply a topic for the day? They might 
have topics inscribed on the flags standard topics, 
that would serve for any voyage. We might leave 
port with History say, personal history ; that would 
pave the way to a general acquaintance among the 
passengers. Then Geography, and if the world is 
really round, and what keeps the sea from spilling. 
Then Politics, and the comparative advantages of 
monarchical and republican governments, for in 
ternational discussion. Then Pathology, and whether 
you 're usually sea-sick, and if there is any reliable 



 

remedy. Then for those who are still up Poetry 
and Fiction; whether women really like Kipling, 
and what kind of novels you prefer. There ought 
to be about ten topics. These boats are sometimes 
very slow. Can 't you suggest something, Miss 
Kenton? There is no hurry! We ve got four to 
talk over, for we must bring up the arrears, you 
know. And now we 'll begin with personal history. 
Your sister doesn 't approve of me, does she?" 

" My sister ?" Ellen faltered, and, between the 
conscience to own the fact and the kindness to deny 
it, she stopped altogether. 

"I needn 't have asked. She told me so herself, 
in almost as many words. She said I was slippery, 
and as close as a trap. Miss Kenton! I have the 
greatest wish to know whether I affect you as both 
slippery and close!" 

"I don 't always know what Lottie means " 

" She means what she says ; and I feel that I am 
under condemnation till I reform. I don 't know 
how to stop being slippery, but I 'm determined 
to stop being close. Will you tell her that for me? 
Will you tell her that you never met an opener, 
franker person? of course, except herself! and 
that so far from being light I seemed to you par 
ticularly heavy? Say that I did nothing but talk 
about myself, and that when you wanted to talk 
about yourself you couldn 't get in a word edgewise. 
Do try, now, Miss Kenton, and see if you can! I 
don 't want you to invent a character for me, quite." 

" Why, there 's nothing to say about me," she 



 

began, in compliance with his gayety, and then she 
fell helpless from it. 

" Well, then, about Tuskingum. I should like to 
hear about Tuskingum, so much !" 

" I suppose we like it because we ve always lived 
there. You haven 't been much in the West, have 
you?" 

"Not as much as I hope to be." He had found 
that Western people were sometimes sensitive con 
cerning their section and were prepared to resent 
complacent ignorance of it. " I ve always thought 
it must be very interesting." 

" It isn t," said the girl. " At least, not like the 
East. I used to be provoked when the lecturers 
said anything like that; but when you ve been to 
New York you see what they mean." 

" The lecturers ?" he queried. 

" They always stayed at our house when they lect 
ured in Tuskingum." 

"Ah! Oh yes," said Breckon, grasping a situ 
ation of which he had heard something, chiefly sa 
tirical. " Of course. And is your father is Judge 
Kenton literary ? Excuse me !" 

" Only in his history. He 's writing the history 
of his regiment; or he gets the soldiers to write 
down all they can remember of the war, and then 
he puts their stories together." 

"How delightful!" said Breckon. "And I sup 
pose it 's a great pleasure to him." 

" I don 't believe it is," said Ellen. " Poppa doesn 't 
believe in war any more." 



 

" Indeed!" said Breckon. " That is very interest 
ing." 

" Sometimes when I 'm helping him with it " 

" Ah, I knew you must help him I" 

"And he comes to a place where there has been 
a dreadful slaughter, it seems as if he felt worse 
about it than I did. He isn 't sure that it wasn 't 
all wrong. He thinks all war is wrong now." 

" Is he has he become a follower of Tolstoy ?" 

" He 's read him. He says he 's the only man that 
ever gave a true account of battles; but he had 
thought it all out for himself before he read Tol 
stoy about fighting. Do you think it is right to 
revenge an injury ?" 

" Why, surely not !" said Breckon, rather startled. 

" That is what we say" the girl pursued. " But 
if some one had injured you abused your confi 
dence, and insulted you, what would you do?" 

" I 'm not sure that I understand," Breckon began. 
The inquiry was superficially impersonal, but he 
reflected that women are never impersonal, or the 
sons of women, for that matter, and he suspected 
an intimate ground. His suspicions were confirmed 
when Miss Kenton said: "It seems easy enough to 
forgive anything that 's done to yourself; but if it 's 
done to some one else, too, have you the right 
isn 't it wrong to let it go ?" 

" You think the question of justice might come 
in then? Perhaps it ought. But what is justice? 
And where does your duty begin to be divided ?" He 
saw her following him with alarming intensity, and 



 

he shrank from the responsibility before him. What 
application might not she make of his words in 
the case, whatever it was, which he chose not to 
imagine ? " To tell you the truth, Miss Kenton, 
I 'm not very clear on that point I 'm not sure that 
I 'm disinterested." 

"Disinterested?" 

" Yes ; you know that I abused your confidence 
at luncheon; and until I know whether the wrong 
involved any one else " He looked at her with 
hovering laughter in his eyes which took wing at 
the reproach in hers. "But if we are to be seri 
ous" 

" Oh no," she said, " it isn 't a serious matter." 
But in the helplessness of her sincerity she could 
not carry it off lightly, or hide from him that she 
was disappointed. 

He tried to make talk about other things. She 
responded vaguely, and when she had given herself 
time she said she believed she would go to Lottie; 
she was quite sure she could get down the stairs 
alone. He pursued her anxiously, politely, and at 
the head of her corridor took leave of her with a 
distinct sense of having merited his dismissal. 

" I see what you mean, Lottie," she said, " about 
Mr. Breckon." 

Lottie did not turn her head on the pillow. " Has 
it taken you the whole day to find it out ?" 



XII 



THE father and the mother had witnessed with 
tempered satisfaction the interest which seemed 
to be growing up between Ellen and the young 
minister. By this time they had learned not to 
expect too much of any turn she might take; she 
reverted to a mood as suddenly as she left it. They 
could not quite make out Breckon himself; he was 
at least as great a puzzle to them as their own child 
was. 

" It seems," said Mrs. Kenton, in their first review 
of the affair, after Boyne had done a brother 's duty 
in trying to bring Ellen under their mother 's cen 
sure, " that he was the gentleman who discussed the 
theatre with Boyne at the vaudeville last winter. 
Boyne just casually mentioned it. I was so pro 
voked!" 

" I don 't see what bearing the fact has," the judge 
remarked. 

"Why, Boyne liked him very much that night, 
but now he seems to feel very much as Lottie does 
about him. He thinks he laughs too much." 

"I don 't know that there 's much harm in that," 
said the judge. "And I shouldn 't value Boyne 's 
opinion of character very highly." 



 

" I value any one 's intuitions especially chil 
dren s." 

"Boyne 's in that middle state where he isn 't 
quite a child. And so is Lottie, for that matter." 

" That is true," their mother assented. " And 
we ought to be glad of anything that takes Ellen 's 
mind off herself. If I could only believe she was 
forgetting that wretch!" 

" Does she ever speak of him ?" 

" She never hints of him, even. But her mind 
may be full of him all the time." 

The judge laughed impatiently. "It strikes me 
that this young Mr. Breckon hasn 't much advantage 
of Ellen in what Lottie calls closeness." 

" Ellen has always been very reserved. It would 
have been better for her if she hadn t. Oh, I scarce 
ly dare to hope anything! Rufus, I feel that in 
everything of this kind we are very ignorant and 
inexperienced." 

" Inexperienced !" Kenton retorted. " I don 't want 
any more experience of the kind Ellen has given 
us." 

" I don 't mean that. I mean this Mr. Breckon. 
I can 't tell what attracts him in the child. She 
must appear very crude and uncultivated to him. 
You needn 't resent it so ! I know she 's read a great 
deal, and you ve made her think herself intellectual 
but the very simple-heartedness of the way she 
would show out her reading would make such a 
young man see that she wasn 't like the girls he 
was used to. They would hide their intellectual- 



 

ity, if they had any. It 's no use your trying to 
fight it, Mr. Kenton. We are country people, and 
he knows it." 

" Tuskingum isn 't country ?" the judge declared. 

" It isn 't city. And we don 't know anything about 
the world, any of us. Oh, I suppose we can read 
and write! But we don 't know the a, b, c of the 
things he knows. He belongs to a kind of society 
of people in New York that I had glimpses 
of in the winter, but that I never imagined before. 
They made me feel very belated and benighted 
as if I hadn 't read or thought anything. They 
didn 't mean to; but I couldn 't help it, and they 
couldn t." 

"You you ve been frightened out of your pro 
priety by what you ve seen in New York," said her 
husband. 

" I ve been frightened, certainly. And I wish 
you had been, too. I wish you wouldn 't be so con 
ceited about Ellen. It scares me to see you so. 
Poor, sick thing, her looks are all gone! You must 
see that. And she doesn 't dress like the girls he 's 
used to. I know we ve got her things in New York ; 
but she doesn 't wear them like a New-Yorker. I 
hope she isn 't going in for more unhappiness !" 

At the thought of this the judge 's crest fell. " Do 
you believe she 's getting interested in him?" he 
asked, humbly. 

" No, no ; I don 't say that. But promise me you 
won 't encourage her in it. And don t, for pity 's 
sake, brag about her to him." 



 

" No, I won t," said the judge, and he tacitly 're 
pented having done so. 

The weather had changed, and when he went up 
from this interview with his wife in their state 
room he found a good many people strung con- 
valescently along the promenade on their steamer- 
chairs. These, so far as they were women, were 
of such sick plainness that when he came to Ellen 
his heart throbbed with a glad resentment of her 
mother 's aspersion of her health and beauty. She 
looked not only very well, and very pretty, but in 
a gay red cap and a trig jacket she looked, to her 
father 's uncritical eyes, very stylish. The glow left 
his heart at sight of the empty seat beside her. 

" Where is Lottie ?" he asked, though it was not 
Lottie 's whereabouts that interested him. 

" Oh, she 's walking with Mr. Breckon somewhere," 
said Ellen. 

" Then she 's made up her mind to tolerate him, 
has she ?" the father asked, more lightly than he felt. 

Ellen smiled. " That wasn 't anything very seri 
ous, I guess. At any rate, she 's walking with him." 

"What book is that?" he asked, of the volume 
she was tilting back and forth under her hand. 

She showed it. " One of his. He brought it up 
to amuse me, he said." 

"While he was amusing himself with Lottie," 
thought the judge, in his jealousy for her. "It 
is going the same old way. Well!" What he said 
aloud was, " And is it amusing you ?" 

" I haven 't looked at it yet," said the girl. " It 's 



 

amusing enough to watch the sea. Oh, poppa! I 
never thought I should care so much for it." 

" And you 're glad we came ?" 

"I don 't want to think about that, I just want 
to know that I 'm here." She pressed his arm gently, 
significantly, where he sat provisionally in the chair 
beside her, and he was afraid to speak lest he should 
scare away the hope her words gave him. 

He merely said, " Well, well !" and waited for her 
to speak further. But her impulse had exhausted 
itself, as if her spirit were like one of those weak 
forms of life which spend their strength in a quick 
run or flight, and then rest to gather force for 
another. "Where 's Boyne?" he asked, after wait 
ing for her to speak. 

" He was here a minute ago. He 's been talking 
with some of the deck passengers that are going 
home because they couldn 't get on in America. 
Doesn 't that seem pitiful, poppa? I always thought 
we had work enough for the whole world." 

" Perhaps these fellows didn 't try very hard to 
find it," said the judge. 

" Perhaps," she assented. 

" I shouldn 't want you to get to thinking that 
it 's all like New York. Remember how comfortable 
everybody is in Tuskingum." 

" Yes," she said, sadly. " How far off Tuskingum 
seems !" 

"Well, don 't forget about it; and remember that 
wherever life is simplest and purest and kindest, 
that is the highest civilization." 



 

" How much like old times it seems to hear you 
talk that way, poppa! I should think I was in the 
library at home. And I made you leave it!" she 
sighed. 

"Your mother was glad of any excuse. And it 
will do us all good, if we take it in the right way," 
said the judge, with a didactic severity that did not 
hide his pang from her. 

" Poor poppa !" she said. 

He went away, saying that he was going to look 
Lottie up. His simple design was to send Lottie 
to her mother, so that Breckon might come back to 
Ellen ; but he did not own this to himself. 

Lottie returned from another direction with 
Boyne, and Ellen said, " Poppa 's gone to look for 
you." 

"Has he?" asked Lottie, dropping decisively into 
her chair. " Well, there 's one thing ; I won 't call 
him poppa any more." 

"What will you call him?" Boyne demanded, 
demurely. 

" I 'll call him father, if you want to know ; and 
I 'm going to call momma mother. I 'm not going 
to have those English laughing at us, and I won 't 
say papa and mamma. Everybody that knows any 
thing says father and mother now." 

Boyne kept looking from one sister to another 
during Lottie 's declaration, and, with his eyes on 
Ellen, he said, "It 's true, Ellen. All the Plump- 
tons did." He was very serious. 

Ellen smiled. " I 'm too old to change. I d rather 
 



 

seem queer in Europe than when I get back to 
Tuskingum." 

"You wouldn 't be queer there a great while," 
said Lottie. " They 'll all be doing it in a week 
after I get home." 

Upon the encouragement given him by Ellen, 
Boyne seized the chance of being of the opposition. 
"Yes," he taunted Lottie, "and you think they 'll 
say woman and man, for lady and gentleman, I 
suppose." 

" They will as soon as they know it 's the thing." 

"Well, I know I won t," said Boyne. "I won 't 
call momma a woman." 

"It doesn 't matter what you do, Boyne dear," 
his sister serenely assured him. 

While he stood searching his mind for a suitable 
retort, a young man, not apparently many years 
his senior, came round the corner of the music- 
room, and put himself conspicuously in view at a 
distance from the Kentons. 

" There he is, now" said Boyne. " He wants 
to be introduced to Lottie." He referred the ques 
tion to Ellen, but Lottie answered for her. 

" Then why don 't you introduce him ?" 

" Well, I would if he was an American. But 
you can 't tell about these English." He resumed 
the dignity he had lost in making the explanation 
to Lottie, and ignored her in turning again to 
Ellen. "What do you think, Ellen?" 

" Oh, I don 't know about such things, Boyne," 
she said, shrinking from the responsibility. 



 

"Well, upon my word!" cried Lottie. "If Ellen 
can talk by the hour with that precious Mr. Breckon, 
and stay up here along with him, when everybody 
else is down below sick, I don 't think she can have 
a great deal to say about a half-grown boy like that 
being introduced to me." 

" He 's as old as you are," said Boyne, hotly. 

" Oh ! I saw him associating with you, and I 
thought he was a boy, too. Pardon me!" Lottie 
turned from giving Boyne his coup-de-grace, to 
plant a little stab in Ellen 's breast. " To be sure, 
now Mr. Breckon has found those friends of his, I 
suppose he won 't want to flirt with Ellen any more." 

"Ah, ha, ha!" Boyne broke in. "Lottie is mad 
because he stopped to speak to some ladies he knew. 
Women, I suppose she d call them." 

"Well, I shouldn 't call him a gentleman, any 
way," said Lottie. 

The pretty, smooth-faced, fresh-faced young fel 
low whom their varying debate had kept in abey 
ance, looked round at them over his shoulder as 
he leaned on the rail, and seemed to discover Boyne 
for the first time. He came promptly towards the 
Kentons. 

" Now," said Lottie, rapidly, " you 'll just have to." 

The young fellow touched his cap to the whole 
group, but he ventured to address only Boyne. 

" Every one seems to be about this morning," he 
said, with the cheery English-rising inflection. 

" Yes," answered Boyne, with such snubbing cold 
ness that Ellen 's heart was touched. 



 

"It 's so pleasant," she said, "after that dark 
weather." 

"Isn 't it?" cried the young fellow, gratefully. 
" One doesn 't often get such sunshine as this at 
sea, you know." 

"My sister, Miss Kenton, Mr. Pogis," Boyne 
solemnly intervened. "And Miss Lottie Ken- 
ton." 

The pretty boy bowed to each in turn, but he 
made no pretence of being there to talk with Ellen. 
"Have you been ill, too?" he actively addressed 
himself to Lottie. 

"No, just mad," she said. "I wasn 't very sick, 
and that made it all the worse being down in a 
poky state-room when I wanted to walk." 

"And I suppose you ve been making up for lost 
time this morning?" 

" Not half," said Lottie. 

"Oh, do finish the half with me!" 

Lottie instantly rose, and flung her sister the 
wrap she had been holding ready to shed from the 
moment the young man had come up. " Keep that 
for me, Nell. Are you good at catching ?" she asked 
him. 

"Catching?" 

"Yes! People," she explained, and at a sudden 
twist of the ship she made a clutch at his shoul 
der. 

"Oh! I think I can catch you." 

As they moved off together, Boyne said, "Well, 
upon my word!" but Ellen did not say anything 



 

in comment on Lottie. After a while she asked, 
" Who were the ladies that Mr. Breckon met ?" 

"I didn 't hear their names. They were some 
body he hadn 't seen before since the ship started. 
They looked like a young lady and her mother. 
It made Lottie mad when he stopped to speak with 
them, and she wouldn 't wait till he could get 
through. Kan right away, and made me come, 
too." 




XIII 

BRECKON had not seen the former interest between 
himself and Ellen lapse to commonplace acquaint 
ance without due sense of loss. He suffered justly, 
but he did not suffer passively, or without several 
attempts to regain the higher ground. In spite of 
these he was aware of being distinctly kept to the 
level which he accused himself of having chosen,
