like that ? " 

Hal and Mary burst into laughter, while Rosa cried 
" Hush ! " She was never sure what this youngster would 
say next. 

" Sure, did ye think I painted it ? " asked Mary. 

" I didn't know," said Little Jerry. " It looks so nice 
and new." And he turned to Hal. " Ain't it ? " 

" You bet," said Hal, and added, " Go on and tell her 
about it. Girls like compliments." 

" Compliments ? " echoed Little Jerry. " What's 
that ? " 

" Why," said Hal, " that's when you. say that her hair 
is like the sunrise, and her eyes are like twilight, or that 
she's a wild rose on a mountain-side." 

"Oh," said the Dago urchin, somewhat doubtfully. 
" Anyhow," he added, " she make nice mustard ! " 

 The time came for Mary to take her departure, 
and Hal got up, wincing with pain, to escort her home. 
She regarded him gravely, having not realised before how 
seriously he was suffering. As they walked along she 
asked, "Why do ye do such work, when ye don't have 
to?" 

" But I do have to ! I have to earn a living! " 

" Ye don't have to earn it that way ! A bright young 
fellow like you — an American ! " 

" Well," said Hal, " I thought it would be interesting 
to see coal mining." 



 

" Now ye've seen it," said the girl — " now quit ! " 

" But it won't do me any harm to go on for a while ! " 

" Won't it ? How can ye know ? When any day they 
may carry you out on a plank ! " 

Her " company manner " was gone j her voice was full 
of bitterness, as it always was when she spoke of North 
Valley. " I know what I'm tellin' ye, Joe Smith. Didn't 
I lose two brothers in it — as fine lads as ye'd find any- 
where in the world ! And many another lad I've seen go 
in laughin', and come out a corpse — or what is worse, for 
workin' people, a cripple. Sometimes I'd like to go and 
stand at the pit-mouth in the mornin' and cry to them, ' Go 
back, go back! Go down the canyon this day! Starve, 
if ye have to, beg if ye have to, only find some other work 
but coal-minin' ! ' " 

Her voice had risen to a passion of protest ; when she 
went on a new note came into it — a note of personal 
terror. " It's worse now — since you came, Joe ! To see 
ye settin' out on the life of a miner — you, that are young 
and strong and different. Oh, go away, Joe, go away 
while ye can ! " 

He was astonished at her intensity. "Don't worry 
about me, Mary," he said. " Nothing will happen to me. 
I'll go away after a while." 

The path was irregular, and he had been holding her 
arm as they walked. He felt her trembling, and went 
on again, quickly, " It's not I that should go away, Mary. 
It's yourself. You hate the place — it's terrible for you 
to have to live here. Have you never thought of going 
away ? " 

She did not answer at once, and when she did the ex- 
citement was gone from her voice ; it was flat and dull with 
despair. " 'Tis no use to think of me. There's nothin' 
I can do — there's nothin' any girl can do when she's poor. 
I've tried — but 'tis like bein' up against a stone wall. I 
can't even save the money to get on a train with ! I've 




tried it — I been savin' for two years — and how much 
d'ye think I got, Joe ? Seven dollars ! Seven dollars in 
two years ! No — ye can't save money in a place where 
there's so many things that wring the heart. Ye may 
hate them for being cowards — but ye must help when ye 
see a man killed, and his family turned out without a roof 
to cover them in the winter-time ! " 

" You're too tender-hearted, Mary." 

" No, 'tis not that ! Should I go off and leave me own 
brother and sister, that need me ? " 

" But you could earn money and send it to them." 

" I earn a little here — I do cleanin' and nursin' for 
some that need me." 

" But outside — couldn't you earn more ? " 

" I could get a job in a restaurant for seven or eight a 
week, but I'd have to spend more, and what I sent home 
would not go so far, with me away. Or I could get a job 
in some other woman's home, and work fourteen hours a 
day for it. But, Joe, 'tis not more drudgery I want, 'tis 
somethin' fair to look upon — somethin' of my own ! " 
She flung out her arms suddenly like one being stifled. 
" Oh, I want somethin' that's fair and clean ! " 

Again he felt her trembling. Again the path was 
rough, and having an impulse of sympathy, he put his arm 
about her. In the world of leisure, one might indulge in 
such considerateness, and he assumed it would not be dif- 
ferent with a miner's daughter. But then, when she was 
close to him, he felt, rather than heard, a sob. 

" Mary ! " he whispered ; and they stopped. Almost 
without realising it, he put his other arm about her, and in 
a moment more he felt her warm breath on his cheek, and 
she was trembling and shaking in his embrace. " Joe ! 
Joel " she whispered. " You take me away! " 

She was a rose in a mining-camp, and Hal was deeply 
moved. The primrose path of dalliance stretched fair 
before him, here in the soft summer night, with a moon 



 

overhead which bore the same message as it bore in the 
Italian gardens of the leisure-class. But not many min- 
utes passed before a cold fear began to steal over Hal. 
There was a girl at home, waiting for him ; and also there 
was the resolve which had been growing in him since his 
coming to this place — a resolve to find some way of com- 
pensation to the poor, to repay them for the freedom and 
culture he had taken; not to prey upon them, upon any 
individual among them. There were the Jeff Cottons for 
that ! 

" Mary," he pleaded, " we mustn't do this." 

" Why not ? " 

" Because — I'm not free. There is some one else." 

He felt her start, but she did not draw away. 
" Where ? " she asked, in a low voice. 

" At home, waiting for me." 

" And why didn't ye tell me ? " 

" I don't know." 

Hal realised in a moment that the girl had ground 
of complaint against him. According to the simple code 
of her world, he had gone some distance with her ; he had 
been seen to walk out with her, he had been accounted 
her " fellow." He had led her to talk to him of herself — 
he had insisted upon having her confidences. And these 
people who were poor did not have subtleties, there was no 
room in their lives for intellectual curiosities, for Platonic 
friendships or philanderings. " Forgive me, Mary! " he 
said. 

She made no answer; but a sob escaped her, and she 
drew back from his arms — slowly. He struggled with 
an impulse to clasp her again. She was beautiful, warm 
with life — and so much in need of happiness ! 

But he held himself in check, and for a minute or two 
they stood apart. Then he asked, humbly, " We can still 
be friends, Mary, can't we? You must know — I'm so 
sorry I" 



 

But she could not endure being pitied. " ? Tis nothin'," 
she said. "Only I thought I was going to get away! 
That's what ye mean to me." 



 Hal had promised Alec Stone to keep a look-out 
for trouble-makers ; and one evening the boss stopped him 
on the street, and asked him if he had anything to report. 
Hal took the occasion to indulge his sense of humour. 

"There's no harm in Mike Sikoria," said he. "He 
likes to shoot off his head, but if he's got somebody to 
listen, that's all he wants. He's just old and grouchy. 
But there's another fellow that I think would bear watch- 
ing." 

" Who's that ? " asked the boss. 

" I don't know his last name. They call him Gus and 
he's a l eager.' Fellow with a red face." 

" I know," said Stone — " Gus Durking." 

" Well, he tried his best to get me to talk about unions. 
He keeps bringing it up, and I think he's some kind of 
trouble-maker." 

" I see," said the boss. " I'll get after him." 

" You won't say I told you," said Hal, anxiously. 

" Oh, no — sure not." And Hal caught the trace of a 
smile on the pit-boss's face. 

He went away, smiling in his turn. The " red-faced 
feller, Gus," was the person Madvik had named as being 
a " spotter " for the company ! 

There were ins and outs to this matter of " spotting," 
and sometimes it was not easy to know what to think. One 
Sunday morning Hal went for a walk up the canyon, and 
on the way he met a young chap who got to talking with 
him, and after a while brought up the question of work- 
ing-conditions in North Valley. He had only been there 
a week, he said, but everybody he had met seemed to be 
grumbling about short weight. He himself had a job as 



 

an " outside man ' so it made no difference to him, but 
he was interested, and wondered what Hal had found. 

Straightway came the question, was this really a work- 
ingman, or had Alec Stone set some one to spying upon 
his spy. This was an intelligent fellow, an American — 
which in itself was suspicious, for most of the new men the 
company got in were from " somewhere East of Suez." 

Hal decided to spar for a while. He did not know, he 
said, that conditions were any worse here than elsewhere. 
You heard complaints, no matter what sort of job you took. 

Yes, said the stranger, but matters seemed to be espe- 
cially bad in the coal-camps. Probably it was because 
they were so remote, and the companies owned everything 
in sight. 

" Where have you been ? " asked Hal, thinking that this 
might trap him. 

But the other answered straight; he had evidently 
worked in half a dozen of the camps. In Mateo he had 
paid a dollar a month for wash-house privileges, and there 
had never been any water after the first three men had 
washed. There had been a common wash-tub for all the 
men, an unthinkably filthy arrangement. At Pine Creek 
- Hal found the very naming of The place made his heart 
stand still — at Pine Creek he had boarded with his boss, 
but the roof of the building leaked, and everything he 
owned was ruined ; the boss would do nothing — yet when 
the boarder moved, he lost his job. At East Ridge, this 
man and a couple of other fellows had rented a two room 
cabin and started to board themselves, in spite of the fact 
that they had to pay a dollar-fifty a sack for potatoes and 
eleven cents a pound for sugar at the company store. 
They had continued until they made the discovery that the 
water supply had run short, and that the water for which 
they were paying the company a dollar a month was being 
pumped from the bottom of the mine, where the filth of 
mules and men was plentiful ! 



 

Hal forced himself to remain non-committal; he shook 
his head and said it was too bad, but the workers always 
got it in the neck, and he didn't see what they could do 
about it. So they strolled back to the camp, the stranger 
evidently baffled, and Hal, for his part, feeling like the 
reader of a detective story at the end of the first chapter. 
Was this young man the murderer, or was he the hero ? 
One would have to read on in the book to find out I 



 Hal kept his eye upon his new acquaintance, and 
perceived that he was talking with others. Before long 
the man tackled Old Mike ; and Mike of course could not 
refuse an invitation to grumble, though it came from the 
devil himself. Hal decided that something must be done 
about it. 

He consulted his friend Jerry, who, being a radical, 
might have some touch-stone by which to test the stranger. 
Jerry sought him out at noon-time, and came back and 
reported that he was as much in the dark as Hal. Either 
the man was an agitator, seeking to " start something," 
or else he was a detective sent in by the company. There 
was only one way to find out — which was for some one 
to talk freely with him, and see what happened to that 
person ! 

After some hesitation, Hal decided that he would be 
the victim. It rewakened his love of adventure, which 
digging in a coal-mine had subdued in him. The mys- 
terious stranger was a new sort of miner, digging into the 
souls of men; Hal would countermine him, and perhaps 
blow him up. He could afford the experiment better than 
some others — better, for example, than little Mrs. David, 
who had already taken the stranger into her home, and 
revealed to him the fact that her husband had been a 
member of the most revolutionary of all miners' organisa- 
tions, the South Wales Federation. 



 

So next Sunday Hal invited the stranger for another 
walk. The man showed reluctance — until Hal said that 
he wanted to talk to him. As they walked up the canyon, 
Hal began, "I've been thinking about what you said of 
conditions in these camps, and I've concluded- it would 
be a good thing if we had a little shaking up here in North 
Valley." 

" Is that so ? " said the other. 

" When I first came here, I used to think the men were 
grouchy. But now I've had a chance to see for myself, 
and I don't believe anybody gets a square deal. For one 
thing, nobody gets full weight in these mines — at least 
not unless he's some favourite of the boss. I'm sure of it, 
for I've tried all sorts of experiments with my partner. 
We've loaded a car extra light, and got eighteen hundred- 
weight, and then we've loaded one high and solid, so that 
we'd know it had twice as much in it — but all we ever 
got was twenty-two and twenty-three. There's just no 
way you can get over that — though everybody knows 
those big cars can be made to hold two or three tons." 

" Yes, I suppose they might," said the other. 

" And if you get the smallest piece of rock in, you get 
a i double-O,' sure as fate ; and sometimes they say you got 
rock in when you didn't. There's no law to make them 
prove it." 

" No, I suppose not." 

" What it comes to is simply this — they make you 
think they are paying fifty-five a ton, but they've secretly 
cut you down to thirty-five. And yesterday at the com- 
pany-store I paid a dollar and a half for a pair of blue 
overalls that I'd priced in Pedro for sixty cents." 

" Well," said the other, " the company has to haul them 
up here, you know ! " 

So, gradually, Hal made the discovery that the tables 
were turned — the mysterious personage was now occu- 
pied in holding him at arm's length ! For some reason, 



 

Hal's sudden interest in industrial justice had failed to 
make an impression. 

So his career as a detective came to an inglorious end. 
" Say, man ! " he exclaimed " What's your game, any- 
how ? " 

" Game ? " said the other, quietly. " How do you 
mean ? " 

" I mean, what are you here for ? " 

" I'm here for two dollars a day — the same as you, I 
guess." 

Hal began to laugh. " You and I are like a couple of 
submarines, trying to find each other under water. I 
think we'd better come to the surface to do our fighting." 

The other considered the simile, and seemed to like it. 
" You come first," said he. But he did not smile. His 
quiet blue eyes were fixed on Hal with deadly serious- 
ness. 

" All right," said Hal ; " my story isn't very thrilling. 
I'm not an escaped convict, I'm not a company spy, as you 
may be thinking. Nor am I a ' natural born ' coal-miner. 
I happen to have a brother and some friends at home who 
think they know about the coal-industry, and it got on 
my nerves, and I came to see for myself. That's all, ex- 
cept that I've found things interesting, and want to stay 
on a while, so I hope you aren't a 'dick ' I " 

The other walked in silence, weighing Hal's words: 
" That's not exactly what you'd call a usual story," he 
remarked, at last. 

" I know," replied Hal. " The best I can say for it 
is that it's true." 

"Well," said the stranger, "I'll take a chance on it. 
I have to trust somebody, if I'm ever to get anywhere. I 
picked you out because I liked your face." He gave Hal 
another searching look as he walked. " Your smile isn't 
that of a cheat. But you're young — so let me remind 
you of the importance of secrecy in this place." 



 




I'll keep mum ' said Hal ; and the stranger opened a 
flap inside his shirt, and drew out a letter which certified 
him to be Thomas Olson, an organiser for the United 
Mine-Workers, the great national union of the coal-miners ! 



 Hal was so startled by this discovery that he 
stopped in his tracks and gazed at the man. He had 
heard a lot about " trouble-makers " in the camps, but so 
far the only kind he had seen were those hired by the com- 
pany to make trouble for the men. But now, here was a 
union organiser ! Jerry had suggested the possibility, but 
Hal had not thought of it seriously; an organiser was a 
mythological creature, whispered about by the miners, 
cursed by the company and its servants, and by Hal's 
friends at home. An incendiary, a fire-brand, a loud- 
mouthed, irresponsible person, stirring up blind and dan- 
gerous passions! Having heard such things all his life, 
Hal's first impulse was of distrust. He felt like the one- 
legged old switchman who had given him a place to sleep, 
after his beating at Pine Creek, and who had said, " Don't 
you talk no union business to me ! " 

Seeing Hal's emotion, the organiser gave an uneasy 
laugh. " While you're hoping I'm not a ' dick,' I trust 
you understand I'm hoping you're not one." 

Hal's answer was to the point. " I was taken for an 
organiser once," he said, and his hands sought the seat of 
his ancient bruises. 

The other laughed. " You got off with a beating ? You 
were lucky. Down in Alabama, not so long ago, they 
tarred and feathered one of us." 

Dismay came upon Hal's face ; but after a moment he 
too began to laugh. "I was just thinking about my 
brother and his friends — what they'd have said if I'd 
come home from Pine Creek in a coat of tar and feath- 
ers!" 



 

" Possibly," ventured the other, " they'd havfe said you 
got what you deserved." 

" Yes, that seems to be their attitude. That's the rule 
they apply to all the world — if anything goes wrong with 
you, it must be your own fault. It's a land of equal 
opportunity." 

" And you'll notice," said the organiser, " that the more 
privileges people have had, the more boldly they talk that 
way." 

Hal began to feel a sense of comradeship with this 
stranger, who was able to understand one's family trou- 
bles ! It had been a long time since Hal had talked with 
any one from the outside world, and he found it a relief 
to his mind. He remembered how, after he had got his 
beating, he had lain out in the rain and congratulated 
himself that he was not what the guards had taken him 
for. Now he was curious about the psychology of an or- 
ganiser. A man must have strong convictions to follow 
that occupation ! 

He made the remark, and the other answered, "You 
can have my pay any time you'll do my work. But let 
me tell you, too, it isn't being beaten and kicked out of 
camp that bothers one most ; it isn't the camp-marshal and 
the spy and the blacklist. Your worst troubles are in- 
side the heads of the fellows you're trying to help! 
Have you ever thought what it would mean to try to 
explain things to men who speak twenty different lan- 
guages ? " 

" Yes, of course," said Hal. " I wonder how you ever 
get a start." 

" Well, you look for an interpreter — and maybe he's 
a company spy. Or maybe the first man you try to con- 
vert reports you to the boss. For, of course, some of the 
men are cowards, and some of them are crooks ; they'll sell 
out the next fellow for a better 'place' — maybe for a 
glass of beer." 



 

" That must have a tendency to weaken your convic- 
tions ' said Hal. 

" No," said the other, in a matter of fact tone. " It's 
hard, but one can't blame the poor devils. They're ig- 
norant — kept so deliberately. The bosses bring them 
here, and have a regular system to keep them from getting 
together. And of course these European peoples have 
their old prejudices — national prejudices, religious 
prejudices, that keep them apart. You see two fellows, 
one you think is exactly as miserable as the other — but 
you find him despising the other, because back home he 
was the other's superior. So they play into the bosses' 
Jiands." 



 They had come to a remote place in the canyon, 
and found themselves seats on a flat rock, where they 
could talk in comfort. 

" Put yourself in their place," said the organiser. 
" They're in a strange country, and one person tells them 
one thing, and another tells them something else. The 
masters and their agents say : i Don't trust the union 
agitators. They're a lot of grafters, they live easy and 
don't have to work. They take your money and call you 
out on strike, and you lose your jobs and your home ; they 
sell you out, maybe, and go on to some other place to 
repeat the same trick.' And the workers think maybe 
that's true ; they haven't the wit to see that if the union 
leaders are corrupt, it must be because the bosses are buy- 
ing them. So you see, they're completely bedevilled ; they 
don't know which way to turn." 

The man was speaking quietly, but there was a little 
glow of excitement in his face. " The company is forever 
repeating that these people are satisfied — that it's we 
who are stirring them up. But are they satisfied? 
You've been here long enough to know ! " 



 

" There's no need to discuss that," Hal answered, " Of 
course they're not satisfied ! They've seemed to me like a 
lot of children crying in the dark — not knowing what's 
the matter with them, or who's to blame, or where to turn 
for help." 

Hal found himself losing his distrust of this man. He 
did not correspond in any way to Hal's imaginary picture 
of a union organiser; he was a blue-eyed, clean-looking 
young American, and instead of being wild and loud- 
mouthed, he seemed rather wistful. He had indignation, 
of course, but it did not take the f ocn tff ranting or florid 
eloquence; and this repression was making its appeal to 
Hal, who, in spite of his democratic impulses, had the 
habits of thought of a class which shrinks from noisiness 
and over-emphasis. 

Also Hal was interested in his attitude towards the 
weaknesses of working-people. The " inertia " of the 
poor, which caused so many people to despair for them — 
their cowardice and instability — these were things about 
whicBTHal had heard all his life. " You can't help them," 
people would say. " They're dirty and lazy, they drink 
and shirk, they betray each other. They've always been 
like that." The idea would be summed up in a formula : 
" You can't change human nature ! " Even Mary Burke, 
herself one of the working-class, spoke of the workers in 
this angry and scornful way. But Olson had faith in 
their manhood, and went ahead to awaken and teach them. 

To his mind the path was clear and straight. " They 
must be taught the lesson of solidarity. As individuals, 
they're helpless in the power of the great corporations; 
but if they stand together, if they sell their labour as a 
unit — then they really count for something." He paused, 
and looked at the other inquiringly. " How do you feel 
about unions ? " 

Hal answered, " They're one of the things I want to 
find out about. You hear this and that — there's so much 



 

prejudice on eao* side. I want to help the under dog, 
but I want to beVure of the right way." 

" What other Ivay is there ? " And Olson paused. 
" To appeal to the lender hearts of the owners ? " 

" Not exactly ; but mightn't one appeal to the world 
in general — to public opinion? I was brought up an 
American, and learned to believe in my country. I can't 
think but there's soue way to get justice. Maybe if the 
men were to go into politics — " 

" Politics ? " cried Olson. " My God ! How long have 
you been in this place ! " 

" Only a couple of months." 

" Well, stay till November, and see what they do with 
the ballot-boxes in these camps ! " 

" I can imagine, of course — " 

" No, you can't. Any more than you could imagine 
the graft and the misery ! " 

" But if the men should take to voting together — " 

" How can they take to voting together — when any one 
who mentions the idea goes down the canyon ? Why, you 
can't even get naturalisation papers, unless you're a com- 
pany man ; they won't register you, unless the boss gives 
you an O. K. How are you going to make a start, unless 
you have a union ? " 

It sounded reasonable, Hal had to admit ; but he thought 
of the stories he had heard about " walking delegates," all 
the dreadful consequences of "union domination." He 
had not meant to go in for unionism ! 

Olson was continuing. "We've had laws passed, a 
whole raft of laws about coal-mining — the eight-hour 
law, the anti-scrip law, the company-store law, the mine- 
sprinkling law, the check-weighman law. What differ- 
ence has it made in North Valley that there are such laws 
on the statute-books? Would you ever even know about 
them ? " 

" Ah, now ! " said Hal. " If you put it that way — 



 

if your movement is to have the law enforced — I'm with 
you ! " 

" But how will you get the law enj orced, except by a 
union? No individual man can do t — it's 'down the 
canyon ' with him if he mentions tbfc law. In Western 
City our union people go to the stp;e officials, but they 
never do anything — and why ? They know we haven't 
got the men behind us ! It's the san?e with the politicians 
as it is with the bosses — the union is the thing that 
counts ! " 

Hal found this an entirely new argument. "People 
don't realise that idea — that men have to be organised to 
get their legal rights." 

And the other threw up his hands with a comical ges- 
ture. "My God! If you want to make a list of the 
things that people don't realise about us miners ! " 



 Olson was eager to win Hal, and went on to tell 
all the secrets of his work. He sought men who believed 
in unions, and were willing to take the risk of trying to 
convert others. In each place he visited he would get a 
group together, and would arrange some way to communi- 
cate with them after he left, smuggling in propaganda 
literature for distribution. So there would be the nucleus 
of an organisation. In a year or two they would have 
such a nucleus in every camp, and then they would be 
ready to come into the open, calling meetings in the towns, 
and in places in the canyons to which the miners would 
flock. So the flame of revolt would leap up ; men would 
join the movement faster than the companies could get 
jid of them, and they would make a demand for their 
rights, backed with the threat of a strike throughout the 
entire district. 

" You understand," added Olson, " we have a legal right 



 

 

to organise — even though the bosses disapprove. You 
need not stand back on that score." 

" Yes," said Hal ; " but it occurs to me that as a matter 
of tactics, it would be better here in North Valley if you 
chose some issue there's less controversy about; if, for 
instance, you'd concentrate on getting a check-weighman." 

The other smiled. " We'd have to have a union to back 
the demand ; so what's the difference ? " 

" Well," argued Hal, " there are prejudices to be reck- 
oned with. Some people don't like the idea of a union — 
they think it means tyranny and violence — " 

The organiser laughed. " You aren't convinced but 
that it does yourself, are you ! Well, all I can tell you is, 
if you want to tackle the job of getting a check-weighman 
in North Valley, I'll not stand in your way ! " 

Here was an idea — a real idea ! Life had grown dull 
for Hal since he had become a buddy, working in a place 
five feet high. This would promise livelier times ! 

But was it a thing he wanted to do? So far he had 
been an observer of conditions in this coal-camp. He had 
convinced himself that conditions were cruel, and he 
had pretty well convinced himself that the cruelty was 
needless and deliberate. . But when it came to a question 
of an action to be taken — then he hesitated, and old 
prejudices and fears made themselves heard. He had been 
told that labour was " turbulent " and " lazy," that it had 
to be " ruled with a strong hand " ; now, was he willing 
to weaken the strong hand, to ally himself with those who 
" fomented labour troubles " ? 

But this would not be the same thing, he told himself. 
This suggestion of Olson's was different from trade union- 
ism, which might be a demoralising force, leading the 
workers from one demand to another, until they were 
seeking to " dominate industry." This would be merely 
an appeal to the law, a test of that honesty and fair dealing 
to which the company everywhere laid claim. If, as the 



 

bosses proclaimed, the workers were fully protected by the 
check-weighman law ; if, as all the world was made to be- 
lieve, the reason there was no check-weighman was simply 
because the men did not ask for one — why, then there 
would be no harm done. If on the other hand a demand 
for a right that was not merely a legal right, but a moral 
right as well — if that were taken by the bosses as an act 
of rebellion against the company — well, Hal would un- 
derstand a little more about the " turbulence " of labour I 
If, as Old Mike and Jobannson and the rest maintained, 
the bosses would " make your life one damn misery " till 
you left — then he would be ready to make a few damn 
miseries for the bosses in return ! 

" It would be an adventure," said Hal, suddenly. 

And the other laughed. " It would that ! " 

" You're thinking I'll have another Pine Creek experi- 
ence ' Hal added. " Well, maybe so — but I have to try 
things out for myself. You see, I've got a brother at 
home, and when I think about going in for revolution, I 
have imaginary arguments with him. I want to be able 
to say ' I didn't swallow anybody's theories ; I tried it for 
myself, and this is what happened.' " 

" Well," replied the organiser, " that's all right. But 
while you're seeking education for yourself and your 
brother, don't forget that I've already got my education. 
I know what happens to men who ask for a check-weigh- 
man, and I can't afford to sacrifice myself proving it 
again."
