count of his new purchase, he would 
diminish his terms for cash in full. 
He sold out for $30,000. And then, 
what do you think he did? He asked 
for greenbacks, and took them, say- 
ing the man in Mexico was a New- 
Englander, with a head full of crotch- 
ets, and preferred greenbacks to gold 
or drafts. People thought it queer, 
since a draft on New York could produce
greenbacks quite conveniently. 
There was talk of this odd thing, but 
only for a day ; that is as long as any 
topic lasts in Denver. 

I was watching, all the time. As 
soon as the sale was completed and 
the money paid — which was on the 
SHdking nth — I began to stick to Fuller's 
track without dropping it for a mo- 

ment. That night — no, 12th, for it 
was a little past midnight — I tracked 
him to his room, which was four doors 
from mine in the same hall, then I 
went back and put on my muddy 
day-laborer disguise, darkened my 
complexion, and sat down in my room 
in the gloom, with a gripsack handy, 
with a change in it, and my door ajar. 
For I suspected that the bird would 

take wing now. In half an hour an 
old woman passed by, carrying a grip; 
I caught tHe~Iainiliar whiff and fol- 
lowed, with my grip, for it was Fuller. 
He left the hotel by a side entrance, 
and at the corner he turned up an 
unfrequented street and walked three 
blocks in a light rain and a heavy 
darkness, and got into a two-horse 
hack, which, of course, was waiting 
for him by appointment. I took a 
seat (uninvited) on the trunk plat- 
form behind, and we drove briskly 
off. We drove ten miles, and the hack 
stopped at a way station and was 
discharged. Fuller got out and took 
a seat on a barrow under the awning, 
as far as he could get from the light; 
I went inside, and watched the ticket- 
office. Fuller bought no ticket; I 
bought none. Presently the train 
came along, and he boarded a car; 
I entered the same car at the other 
end, and came down the aisle and 
took the seat behind him. When 
he paid the conductor and named 
his objective point, I dropped back 
several seats, while the conductor 
was changing a bill, and when he 
came to me I paid to the same place 
— about a hundred miles westward. 

From that time for a week on end 
he led me a dance. He travelled here 
and there and yonder — always on a 
general westward trend — but he was 
not a woman after the first day. He 
was a laborer, like myself, and wore 
bushy false whiskers. His outfit was 

perfect, and he could do the character 
without thinking about it, for he had 
served the trade for wages. His near- 
est friend could not have recognized 
him. At last he located himself here, 
the obscurest little mountain camp 
in Montana; he has a shanty, and Lming 
goes out prospecting daily; is gone Xn% 
all day, and avoids society. I am 



living at a miner's boarding-house, 
and it is an awful place: the bunks, 
the food, the dirt — everything.. 

We have been here four weeks, 
and in that time I have seen him but 
once; but every night I go over his 
track and post myself. As soon as 
he engaged a shanty here I went to a 
town fifty miles away and telegraphed 
that Denver hotel to keep my baggage 
till I should send for it. I need noth- 
ing here but a change of army shirts, 
and I brought that with me. 

Silver Gulch, June 12. 

The Denver episode has never found 
its way here, I think. I know the 
most of the men in camp, and they 
have never referred to it, at least in 
FuUer  hearing. Fuller doubtless feels 
Sfe quite safe in these conditions. He 

has located a claim, two miles away, 
in an out-of-the-way place in the 
mountains; it promises very well, 
and he is working it diligently. Ah, 
but the change in him! He never 
smiles, and he keeps quite to him- 
self, consorting with no one — he who 
was so fond of company and so cheery 
only two months ago. I have seen 
him passing along several times re- 
cently — drooping, forlorn, the spring 
gone from his step, a pathetic figure. 
He calls himself David Wilson. 

I can trust him to remain here until 
we disturb him. Since you insist, I 
will banish him again, but I do not 
see how he can be unhappier than he 
already is. I will go back to Denver 
and treat myself to a little season of 
comfort, and edible food, and endur- 
able beds, and bodily decency; then 
I will fetch my things, and notify 
poor papa Wilson to move on. 

Denver, June 19. 
They miss him here. They all hope 
he is prospering in Mexico, and they 
do not say it just with their mouths, 
but out of their hearts. You know 
you can always tell. I am loitering 
here overlong, I confess it. But if 
you were in my place you would have 
charity for me. Yes, I know what 
you will say, and you are right: if 
I were in your place, and carried your 
scalding memories in my heart — 

I will take the night train back to- 
morrow. 

Denver, June 20. 

God forgive us, mother, we are 
hunting the wrong man! I have not 
slept any all night. I am now wait- 
ing, at dawn, for the fnorning train 
— and how the minutes drag, how 
they drag! 

This Jacob Fuller is a cousin of 
the guilty one. How stupid we have 
been not to reflect that the guilty 
one would never again wear his own 
name after that fiendish deed! The 
Denver Fuller is four years younger 
than the other one; he came here a 
young widower in '79, aged twenty- 
one — a year before you were married ; 
and the documents to prove it are in- 
numerable. Last night I talked with 
familiar friends of his who have known 
him from the day of his arrival. I 
said nothing, but a few days from 
now I will land him in this town again, 
with the loss upon his mine made 
good; and there will be a banquet, 
and a torch-light procession, and there 
will not be any expense on anybody 
but me. Do you call this "gush"? 

I am only a boy, as you well know; 
it is my privilege. By-and-by I shall 
not be a boy any more. 

Silver Gulch, July 3. 
Mother, he is gone! Gone, and left 
no trace. The scent was cold when 

I came. To-day I am out of bed for 
the first time since. I wish I were 
not a boy; then I could stand shocks 
better. They all think he went west. 
I start to-night, in a wagon — two or 
three hours of that, then I get a train. 
I don't know where Tm going, but I 
must go; to try to keep still would be 
torture. 

Of course he has effaced himself 
with a new name and a disguise. 
This means that 7 may ham to search 
the whole globe to find him. Indeed 
it is what I expect. Do you see, moth- 
er? It is  that am the Wandering 
Jew. The irony of it! We arranged 
that for another. 

Think of the difficulties! And 
there would be none if I only could 
advertise for him. But if there is any 
way to do it that would not frighten 
him, I have not been able to think it 
out, and I have tried till my brains 
are addled. ''If the gentleman who 
lately bought a mine in Mexico and 
sold one in Denver will send his ad- 
dress to" (to whom, mother?), "it 
will be explained to him that it was 
all a mistake; his forgiveness will 
be asked, and full reparation made 
for a loss which he sustained in a 
certain matter' Do you see? He 
would think it a trap. Well, any one 
would. If I should say, ''It is now 
known that he was not the man wanted, 
but another man — a man who once 
bore the same name, but discarded 
it for good reasons'' — would that an- 
swer? But the Denver people would 
wake up then and say "Oho'' and 
they would remember about the sus- 
picious greenbacks, and say, ''Why 
did he run away if he wasn't the right 
man? — it is too thin." If I failed to 
find him he would be ruined there — 
there where there is no taint upon 
him now. You have a better head 
than mine. Help me. 

I have one clew, and only one. I 
know his handwriting. If he puts 
his new false name upon a hotel regis- 
ter and does not disguise it too much, 
it will be valuable to me if I ever run 
across it. 



San Francisco, June 28, 1898. 
You already know how well I have 
earched the States from Colorado 
to the Pacific, and how nearly I came 
to getting him once. Well, I have 
had another close_jiiiss. It was here, 
yesterday. I struck his trail, hot, 
on the street, and followed it on a 
run to a cheap hotel. That was a 
costly mistake; a dog would have 
gone the other way. But I am only 
part dog, and can get very humanly 
stupid when excited. He had been 
stopping in that house ten days; I 
almost know, now, that he stops long 
nowhere, the past six or eight months, 
but is restless and has to keep moving. 
I understand that feeling ! and I know 
what it is to feel it. He still uses the 
name he had registered when I came 
so near catching him nine months 
ago — " James Walker '' ; doubtless the 
same he adopted when he fled from 
Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, 
and has small taste for fancy names. 
I recognized the hand easily, through 
its slight disguise. A square man, 
and not good at shams and pretences. 
They said he was just gone, on a 
journey; left no address; didn't say 
where he was going; looked fright- 
ened when asked to leave his address ; 
had no baggage but a cheap valise; 
carried it off on foot — a "stingy 
old person, and not much loss to the 
house." "Old!" I suppose he is, crimnal. 
I hardly heard; I was there 
but a moment. I rushed along his 
trail, and it led me to a wharf. Moth- 
er, the smoke of the steamer he had 
taken was just fading out on the hori- 
zon! I should have saved half an 
hour if I had gone in the right direc- 
tion at first. I could have taken a 
fast tug, and should have stood a 
chance of catching that vessel. She 
is bound for Melbourne. 

Hope Canyon, California, 
October 3, 1900. 

You have a right to complain. 
" A letter a year " is b. paucity ; I 
freely acknowledge it; but how can 
one write when there is nothing to 
write about but failures? No one 
can keep it up ; it breaks the heart. 
I told you — it seems ages ago, now 
— how I missed him at Melbourne, and 
 then chased him all over Australasia 
for months on end. 

Well, then, after that I followed him 
to India ; almost saw him in Bombay ; 
traced him all around — to Baroda, 
Rawal-Pindi, Lucknow, Lahore, Cawn- 
pore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Madras— 
oh, everywhere; week after week, 
month after month, through the dust 
and swelter — always approximately 
on his track, sometimes close upon 
him, yet never catching him. And 
down to Ceylon, and then to — Never 
mind , by-and-by I will write it all out. 
I chased him home to California, 
and down to Mexico, and back again
to California. Since then I have been 
hunting him about the State from 
the first of last January down to a 
month ago. I feel almost sure he is 
not far from Hope Canyon; I traced 
him to a point thirty miles from here, 
but there I lost the trail; some one 
gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. 
I am taking a rest, now — modi- 
fied by searchings for the lost trail. 
I was tired to death, mother, and low- 
spirited, and sometimes coming im- 
comfortably near to losing hope; but 
the miners in this little camp are 
good fellows, and I am used to their 
sort this long time back; and their 
breezy ways freshen a person up and 
make him forget his troubles. I have 
been here a month. I am cabining 
Sammy with a young fellow named '' Sam- 
 my" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the 
only son of his mother — like me — 
and loves her dearly, and writes to 
her every week — part of which is like 
me. He is a timid body, and in the 
matter of intellect — well, he cannot 
be depended upon to set a river on 
fire; but no matter, he is well liked; 
he is good and fine, and it is meat 
and bread and rest and luxury to 
sit and talk with him and have a 
comradeship again. I wish "James 
Walker" could have it. He had 
friends; he liked company. That 
brings up that picture of him, the 
time that I saw him last. The pathos 
of it! It comes before me often and 
often. At that very time, poor thing, 
I was girding up my conscience to 
make him move on again! 

Hillyer's heart is better than mine, 
better than anybody's in the com- 
munity, I suppose, for he is the one 
friend of the black sheep of the.camE. V, 



— Flint Buckner — and the only man 
Flint ever talks with or allows to 
talk with him. He says he knows 
Flint's history, and that it is trouble 
that has made him what he is, and 
so one ought to be as charitable tow- 
ard him as one can. Now none but 
a pretty large heart could find space 
to accommodate a lodger like Flint 
Buckner, from all I hear about him 
outside. I think that this one detail
will give you a better idea of 
Sammy's character than any labored- 
out description I could furnish you 
of him. In one of our talks he said 
something about like this: "Flint's 
a kinsman of mine, and he pours out 
all his troubles to me — empties his 
breast from time to time, or I reckon 
it would burst. There couldn't be 
any unhappier man, Archy Stillman; 
his life has been made up of misery 
of mind — he isn't near as old as he 
looks. He has lost the feel of re- 
posef ulness and peace — oh, years and 
years ago! He doesn't know what 
good luck is — never has had any; 
often says he wishes he was in the 
other hell, he is so tired of this one." 



IV 

No real gentleman will tell the naked 
truth in the presence of ladies. 

IT was a crisp and spicy 
morning in early October. 
The lilacs and la- 
burnums, lit with the 
glory-fires of autumn, himg burning 
and flashing in the upper air, a fairy 
bridge provided by kind Nature for 
the wingless wild things that have 
their homes in the tree-tops and would 
visit together ; the larch and the pome- 
granate flung their purple and yellow 
flames in brilliant broad splashes 
along the slanting sweep of the wood- 
land; the sensuous fragrance of in- 
numerable deciduous flowers rose upon 
the swooning atmosphere; far in the 
empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept 
upon motionless wing; everywhere 
brooded stillness, serenity, and the 
peace of God. 

October is the time — 1900; Hope 
Canyon is the place, a silver-mining 
camp away down in the Esmeralda 
region. It is a secluded spot, high 
and remote; recent as to discovery; 
thought by its occupants to be rich 
in metal — a year or two's prospect- 
ing will decide that matter one way 
or the other. For inhabitants, the 
camp has about two hundred miners, 
one white woman and child, several 
Chinese washermen, five squaws, and   
a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rab- 
bit-skin robes, battered plug hats, 
and tin -can necklaces. There are 
no mills as yet; there is no church, 
no newspaper. The camp has ex- 
isted but two years; it has made no 
big strike; the world is ignorant of 
its name and place. 

On both sides of the canyon the 
mountains rise wall-like, three thou- 
sand feet, and the long spiral of strag- 
gling huts down in its narrow bottom 
gets a kiss from the sun only once a 
day, when he sails over at noon. The 
village is a couple of miles long; the 
cabins stand well apart from each 
other. The tavern is the only " frame " 
house — the only house, one might 
say. It occupies a central position, 
and is the evening resort of the pop- 
ulation. They drink there, and play 
seven-up and dominoes ; also billiards, 
for there is a table, crossed all over 
with torn places repaired with court- 
plaster; there are some cues, but no 
leathers; some chipped balls which 
clatter when they run, and do not 
slow up gradually, but stop suddenly 
and sit down; there is part of a cube 
of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint 
in it ; and the man who can score six 
on a single break can set up the drinks 
at the bar's expense. 



Flint Buckner's cabin was the last 
one of the village, going south; his 
silver claim was at the other end of 
the village, northward, and a little 
beyond the last hut in that direction. 
He was a sour creature, unsociable,  'our 
creature and had no companionships. Peo- 
ple who had tried to get acquainted 
with him had regretted it and dropped 
him. His history was not known. 
Some believed that Sammy Hillyer 
knew it; others said no. If asked, 
Hillyer said no, he was not acquainted 
with it. Flint had a meek English 
youth of sixteen or seventeen with 
him, whom he treated roughly, both 
in public and in private, and of course 
this lad was applied to for informa- 
tion, but with no success. Fetlock 
Jones — name of the youth — said that 
Flint picked him up on a prospecting 
tramp, and as he had neither home 
nor friends in America, he had found 
it wise to stay and take Buckner's 
hard usage for the sake of the salary, 
bacon which was bacon and beans. Further 
and beans than this he could offer no 
testimony. 

Fetlock had been in this slavery 
for a month now, and under his meek 
exterior he was slowly consuming 
to a cinder with the insults and hu- 
miliations which his master had put 
upon him. For the meek suffer bitter- 
ly from these hurts; more bitterly, 
perhaps, than do the manlier sort, who 
can burst out and get relief with words 
or blows when the limit of endurance 
has been reached. Good-hearted peo- 
ple wanted to help Fetlock out of his 
trouble, and tried to get him to leave 
to quit Buckner; but the boy showed 
fright at the thought, and said he 
"dasn't". 

Pat Riley urged him, and said: 

'' You leave the damned hunks and 
come with me; don't you be afraid, 
ril take care of him.'* 

The boy thanked him with tears 
in his eyes, but shuddered and said 
he "dasn't risk it"; he said Flint 
would catch him alone, some time, in 
the night, and then — " Oh, it makes 
me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it.'' 

Others said, ''Run away from him; 
we'll stake you ; skip out for the coast 
some night." But all these sugges- 
tions failed; he said Flint would hunt 
him down and fetch him back, just 
for meanness. 

The people could not understand 
this. The boy's miseries went steadily 
on, week after week. It is quite 
likely that the people would have 

Qf understood if they had known how 

he was employing his spare time. 
He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; 
and there, nights, he nursed his bruis- 
es and his humiliations, and studied 
and studied over a single problem — 
how he could murder Flint Buckner 
and not be found out. It was the 
only joy he had in life; these hours 
were the only ones in the twenty-four 
which he looked forward to with eager- 
ness and spent in happiness. 

He thought of poison. No — that 
would not serve; the inquest would 
reveal where it was procured and who 
had procured it. He thought of a shot 
in the back in a lonely place when 
Flint would be homeward-boiind at 
midnight — his unvarying hour for 
the trip. No — somebody might be 
near, and catch him. He thought 
of stabbing him in his sleep. No — 
he might strike an inefficient blow, 
and Flint would seize him. He ex- 
amined a hundred different ways — 
none of them would answer; for in 
even the very obscurest and secretest 
of them there was always the fatal _ 

defect of a risk, a chance, a possible 
risk in that he might be found out. He 
would have none of that. 

But he was patient, endlessly 
patient. There was no hurry, he 
said to himself. He would never 
leave Flint till he left him a corpse; 
there was no hurry — he would find 
the way. It was somewhere, and 
he would endure shame and pain 
and misery until he found it. Yes, 
somewhere there was a way which 
'oenge would leave not a trace, not even the 
faintest clew to the murderer — there 
was no hurry — he would find that 
way, and then — oh, then, it would 
just be good to be alive! Meantime 
he would diligently keep up his rep- 
utation for meekness; and also, as 
always theretofore, he would allow 
no one to hear him say a resentful 
or offensive thing about his oppressor. 
Two days before the before-men- 
tioned October morning Flint had 
bought some things, and he and Fet- 
lock had brought them home to Flint's 
cabin: a fresh box of candles, which 
they put in the corner; a tin can of mlteHal 
blasting-powder, which they placed 
upon the candle-box; a keg of blast- 
ing-powder, which they placed under 
Flint's bunk; a huge coil of fuse, 
which they hung on a peg. Fet- 
lock reasoned that Flint's mining 
operations had outgrown the pick, 
and that blasting was about to begin 
now. He had seen blasting done, 
and he had a notion of the process, 
but he had never helped in it. His 
conjecture was right — blasting - time 
had come. In the morning the pair 
carried fuse, drills, and the powder- 
can to the shaft; it was now eight 
feet deep, and to get into it and out 
of it a short ladder was used. They 
descended, and by command Fetlock 
ls held the drill— without any instruc- 
tions as to the right way to hold it — 
and Flint proceeded to strike. The 
sledge came down; the drill sprang 
out of Fetlock's hand, almost as a 
matter of course. 

"You mangy son of a nigger, is 
that any way to hold a drill? Pick 
it up! Stand it up! There — hold 
fast. D you! I'll teach youi'' 

At the end of an hour the drilling 
was finished. 

"Now, then, charge it." 

The boy started to pour in the pow- 
der. 

"Idiot!'' . 

A heavy bat on the jaw laid the 
lad out. 


"Get up! You can't lie snivelling 
there. Now, then, stick in the fuse 
first. Now put in the powder. Hold 
on, hold on! Are you going to fill 
the hole all up? Of all the sap-headed 
milksops I — Put in some dirt! Put 
in some gravel! Tamp it down! 
Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! 
get out of the way!'' He snatched 



the iron and tamped the charge him-  

self, meantime cursing and blaspheming 
like a fiend. Then he fired the 
fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and 
ran fifty yards away. Fetlock follow- 
ing. They stood waiting a few min- 
utes, then a great volume of smoke 
and rocks burst high into the air 
with a thunderous explosion; after 
a little there was a shower of descending 
stones; then all was serene 
again. 

"I wish to God you'd been in itl'' 
remarked the master. 

They went down the shaft, cleaned 
it out, drilled another hole, and put 
in another charge. 
Timing "Look herel How much fuse are 

fuse yo proposing to waste? Don't you 

know how to time a fuse?" 

"No, sir." 

"You don't! Well, if you don't 
beat anything I ever saw!" 

He climbed out of the shaft and 
spoke down: 

" Well, idiot, are you going to be all 
day? Cut the fuse and Hght it!" 

The trembling creature began, 

"If you please, sir, I — " 

" You talk back to me ? Cut it and 
light it!" 

The boy cut and lit. 

"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! 
I wish you were in — " 

In his rage he snatched the ladder 
out of the shaft and ran. The boy 
was aghast. 

"Oh, my God! Help! Help! Oh, 
save me!" he implored. "Oh, what 
can I do! What can I do!" 

He backed against the wall as 

tightly as he could; the sputtering 

fuse frightened the voice out of him; 

his breath stood still; he stood gazing 

and impotent; in two seconds, three 

seconds, four, he would be flying se to 

death 
toward the sky torn to fragments. 

Then he had an inspiration. He 
sprang at the fuse and severed the 
inch of it that was left above ground, 
and was saved. 

He sank down limp and half life- 
less with fright, his strength all 
gone; but he muttered with a deep 

joy: 
"He has learnt me! I knew there 

fa,.   way, if I would wait' 

After a matter of five minutes Buck- 
ner stole to the shaft, looking wor- 
ried and uneasy, and peered down 
into it. He took in the situation; he 
saw what had happened. He low- 
ered the ladder, and the boy dragged 
himself weakly up it. He was very 
white. His appearance added some- 
thing to Buckner's uncomfortable 
regret and sympathy which sat upon 
him awkwardly from lack of prac- 
tice: 

"It was an accident, you know. 
Don't say anything about it to any- 
body ; I was excited, and didn't notice 
what I was doing. You're not look- 
ing well; you've worked enough for 
to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat 
what you want, and rest. It's just 
an accident, you know, on account 
of my being excited." 

"It scared me' said the lad, as he ' 
started away; "but I learnt something,
so I don't mind it." 

"Damned easy to please!" muttered 
Buckner, following him with his eye. 
"I wonder if he'll tell? Mightn't 
he? ... I wish it had killed him." 



The boy took no advantage of 
his holiday in the matter of rest- 
Fggf ing; he employed it in work, eager 
. and feverish and happy work. A 

thick growth of chaparral extended 
down the mountain - side clear to 
Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's 
labor was done in the dark intrica- 
cies of that stubborn growth ; the rest 
of it was done in his own shanty. 
At last all was complete, and he 
said: 

"If he's got any suspicions that
