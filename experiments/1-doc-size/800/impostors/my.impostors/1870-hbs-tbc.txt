 'Lady Lovelace died in 1852; and, for her few remaining years, Lady
 Byron was devoted to her grandchildren. But nearer calls never
 lessened her interest in remoter objects. Her mind was of the large
 and clear quality which could comprehend remote interests in their
 true proportions, and achieve each aim as perfectly as if it were the
 only one. Her agents used to say that it was impossible to mistake her
 directions; and thus her business was usually well done. There was no
 room, in her case, for the ordinary doubts, censures, and sneers about
 the misapplication of bounty.

 'Her taste did not lie in the "Charity-Ball" direction; her funds
 were not lavished in encouraging hypocrisy and improvidence among
 the idle and worthless; and the quality of her charity was, in fact,
 as admirable as its quantity. Her chief aim was the extension and
 improvement of popular education; but there was no kind of misery that
 she heard of that she did not palliate to the utmost, and no kind of
 solace that her quick imagination and sympathy could devise that she
 did not administer.

 'In her methods, she united consideration and frankness with singular
 success. For one instance among a thousand: A lady with whom she had
 had friendly relations some time before, and who became impoverished
 in a quiet way by hopeless sickness, preferred poverty with an easy
 conscience to a competency attended by some uncertainty about the
 perfect rectitude of the resource. Lady Byron wrote to an intermediate
 person exactly what she thought of the case. Whether the judgment
 of the sufferer was right or mistaken was nobody's business but her
 own: this was the first point. Next, a voluntary poverty could never
 be pitied by anybody: that was the second. But it was painful to
 others to think of the mortification to benevolent feelings which
 attends poverty; and there could be no objection to arresting that
 pain. Therefore she, Lady Byron, had lodged in a neighbouring bank
 the sum of one hundred pounds, to be used for benevolent purposes;
 and, in order to preclude all outside speculation, she had made the
 money payable to the order of the intermediate person, so that the
 sufferer's name need not appear at all.

 'Five and thirty years of unremitting secret bounty like this must
 make up a great amount of human happiness; but this was only one of
 a wide variety of methods of doing good. It was the unconcealable
 magnitude of her beneficence, and its wise quality, which made her a
 second time the theme of English conversation in all honest households
 within the four seas. Years ago, it was said far and wide that Lady
 Byron was doing more good than anybody else in England; and it was
 difficult to imagine how anybody could do more.

 'Lord Byron spent every shilling that the law allowed him out of
 her property while he lived, and left away from her every shilling
 that he could deprive her of by his will; yet she had, eventually, a
 large income at her command. In the management of it, she showed the
 same wise consideration that marked all her practical decisions. She
 resolved to spend her whole income, seeing how much the world needed
 help at the moment. Her care was for the existing generation, rather
 than for a future one, which would have its own friends. She usually
 declined trammelling herself with annual subscriptions to charities;
 preferring to keep her freedom from year to year, and to achieve
 definite objects by liberal bounty, rather than to extend partial help
 over a large surface which she could not herself superintend.

 'It was her first industrial school that awakened the admiration of
 the public, which had never ceased to take an interest in her, while
 sorely misjudging her character. We hear much now--and everybody hears
 it with pleasure--of the spread of education in "common things;" but
 long before Miss Coutts inherited her wealth, long before a name was
 found for such a method of training, Lady Byron had instituted the
 thing, and put it in the way of making its own name.

 'She was living at Ealing, in Middlesex, in 1834; and there she
 opened one of the first industrial schools in England, if not the
 very first. She sent out a master to Switzerland, to be instructed
 in De Fellenburgh's method. She took, on lease, five acres of land,
 and spent several hundred pounds in rendering the buildings upon it
 fit for the purposes of the school. A liberal education was afforded
 to the children of artisans and labourers during the half of the day
 when they were not employed in the field or garden. The allotments
 were rented by the boys, who raised and sold produce, which afforded
 them a considerable yearly profit if they were good workmen. Those who
 worked in the field earned wages; their labour being paid by the hour,
 according to the capability of the young labourer. They kept their
 accounts of expenditure and receipts, and acquired good habits of
 business while learning the occupation of their lives. Some mechanical
 trades were taught, as well as the arts of agriculture.

 'Part of the wisdom of the management lay in making the pupils pay.
 Of one hundred pupils, half were boarders. They paid little more than
 half the expenses of their maintenance, and the day-scholars paid
 threepence per week. Of course, a large part of the expense was borne
 by Lady Byron, besides the payments she made for children who could
 not otherwise have entered the school. The establishment flourished
 steadily till 1852, when the owner of the land required it back for
 building purposes. During the eighteen years that the Ealing schools
 were in action, they did a world of good in the way of incitement
 and example. The poor-law commissioners pointed out their merits.
 Land-owners and other wealthy persons visited them, and went home and
 set up similar establishments. During those years, too, Lady Byron had
 herself been at work in various directions to the same purpose.

 'A more extensive industrial scheme was instituted on her
 Leicestershire property, and not far off she opened a girls' school
 and an infant school; and when a season of distress came, as such
 seasons are apt to befall the poor Leicestershire stocking-weavers,
 Lady Byron fed the children for months together, till they could
 resume their payments. These schools were opened in 1840. The next
 year, she built a schoolhouse on her Warwickshire property; and, five
 years later, she set up an iron schoolhouse on another Leicestershire
 estate.

 'By this time, her educational efforts were costing her several
 hundred pounds a year in the mere maintenance of existing
 establishments; but this is the smallest consideration in the case.
 She has sent out tribes of boys and girls into life fit to do their
 part there with skill and credit and comfort. Perhaps it is a still
 more important consideration, that scores of teachers and trainers
 have been led into their vocation, and duly prepared for it, by what
 they saw and learned in her schools. As for the best and the worst of
 the Ealing boys, the best have, in a few cases, been received into the
 Battersea Training School, whence they could enter on their career as
 teachers to the greatest advantage; and the worst found their school
 a true reformatory, before reformatory schools were heard of. At
 Bristol, she bought a house for a reformatory for girls; and there her
 friend, Miss Carpenter, faithfully and energetically carries out her
 own and Lady Byron's aims, which were one and the same.

 'There would be no end if I were to catalogue the schemes of which
 these are a specimen. It is of more consequence to observe that her
 mind was never narrowed by her own acts, as the minds of benevolent
 people are so apt to be. To the last, her interest in great political
 movements, at home and abroad, was as vivid as ever. She watched every
 step won in philosophy, every discovery in science, every token of
 social change and progress in every shape. Her mind was as liberal
 as her heart and hand. No diversity of opinion troubled her: she
 was respectful to every sort of individuality, and indulgent to all
 constitutional peculiarities. It must have puzzled those who kept up
 the notion of her being "strait-laced" to see how indulgent she was
 even to Epicurean tendencies,--the remotest of all from her own.

 'But I must stop; for I do not wish my honest memorial to degenerate
 into panegyric. Among her latest known acts were her gifts to the
 Sicilian cause, and her manifestations on behalf of the antislavery
 cause in the United States. Her kindness to William and Ellen Craft
 must be well known there; and it is also related in the newspapers,
 that she bequeathed a legacy to a young American to assist him under
 any disadvantages he might suffer as an abolitionist.

 'All these deeds were done under a heavy burden of ill health. Before
 she had passed middle life, her lungs were believed to be irreparably
 injured by partial ossification. She was subject to attacks so
 serious, that each one, for many years, was expected to be the last.
 She arranged her affairs in correspondence with her liabilities: so
 that the same order would have been found, whether she died suddenly
 or after long warning.

 'She was to receive one more accession of outward greatness before she
 departed. She became Baroness Wentworth in November, 1856. This is one
 of the facts of her history; but it is the least interesting to us, as
 probably to her. We care more to know that her last days were bright
 in honour, and cheered by the attachment of old friends worthy to pay
 the duty she deserved. Above all, it is consoling to know that she who
 so long outlived her only child was blessed with the unremitting and
 tender care of her grand-daughter. She died on the 16th of May, 1860.

 'The portrait of Lady Byron as she was at the time of her marriage
 is probably remembered by some of my readers. It is very engaging.
 Her countenance afterwards became much worn; but its expression of
 thoughtfulness and composure was very interesting. Her handwriting
 accorded well with the character of her mind. It was clear, elegant,
 and womanly. Her manners differed with circumstances. Her shrinking
 sensitiveness might embarrass one visitor; while another would be
 charmed with her easy, significant, and vivacious conversation. It
 depended much on whom she talked with. The abiding certainty was, that
 she had strength for the hardest of human trials, and the composure
 which belongs to strength. For the rest, it is enough to point to her
 deeds, and to the mourning of her friends round the chasm which her
 departure has made in their life, and in the society in which it is
 spent. All that could be done in the way of personal love and honour
 was done while she lived: it only remains now to see that her name and
 fame are permitted to shine forth at last in their proper light.'

We have simply to ask the reader whether a life like this was not the
best, the noblest answer that a woman could make to a doubting world.




CHAPTER V.

THE ATTACK ON LADY BYRON'S GRAVE.


We have now brought the review of the antagonism against Lady Byron
down to the period of her death. During all this time, let the candid
reader ask himself which of these two parties seems to be plotting
against the other.

Which has been active, aggressive, unscrupulous? which has been
silent, quiet, unoffending? Which of the two has laboured to make a
party, and to make that party active, watchful, enthusiastic?

Have we not proved that Lady Byron remained perfectly silent during
Lord Byron's life, patiently looking out from her retirement to see
the waves of popular sympathy, that once bore her up, day by day
retreating, while his accusations against her were resounding in his
poems over the whole earth? And after Lord Byron's death, when all
the world with one consent began to give their memorials of him, and
made it appear, by their various 'recollections of conversations,' how
incessantly he had obtruded his own version of the separation upon
every listener, did she manifest any similar eagerness?

Lady Byron had seen the 'Blackwood' coming forward, on the first
appearance of 'Don Juan,' to rebuke the cowardly lampoon in words
eloquent with all the unperverted vigour of an honest Englishman. Under
the power of the great conspirator, she had seen that 'Blackwood'
become the very eager recipient and chief reporter of the stories
against her, and the blind admirer of her adversary.

All this time, she lost sympathy daily by being silent. The world
will embrace those who court it; it will patronise those who seek its
favour; it will make parties for those who seek to make parties: but
for the often accused who do not speak, who make no confidants and no
parties, the world soon loses sympathy.

When at last she spoke, Christopher North says 'she astonished
the world.' Calm, clear, courageous, exact as to time, date, and
circumstance, was that first testimony, backed by the equally clear
testimony of Dr. Lushington.

It showed that her secret had been kept even from her parents. In words
precise, firm, and fearless, she says, 'If these statements on which
Dr. Lushington and Sir Samuel Romilly formed their opinion were false,
the responsibility and the odium should rest with me only.' Christopher
North did not pretend to disbelieve this statement. He breathed not a
doubt of Lady Byron's word. He spoke of the crime indicated, as one
which might have been foul as the grave's corruption, unforgivable as
the sin against the Holy Ghost. He rebuked the wife for bearing this
testimony, even to save the memory of her dead father and mother, and,
in the same breath, declared that she ought now to go farther, and
speak fully the one awful word, and then--'a mitigated sentence, or
eternal silence!'

But Lady Byron took no counsel with the world, nor with the literary
men of her age. One knight, with some small remnant of England's old
chivalry, set lance in rest for her: she saw him beaten back unhorsed,
rolled in the dust, and ingloriously vanquished, and perceived that
henceforth nothing but injury could come to any one who attempted to
speak for her.

She turned from the judgments of man and the fond and natural hopes of
human nature, to lose herself in sacred ministries to the downcast and
suffering. What nobler record for woman could there be than that which
Miss Martineau has given?

Particularly to be noted in Lady Byron was her peculiar interest in
reclaiming fallen women. Among her letters to Mrs. Prof. Follen, of
Cambridge, was one addressed to a society of ladies who had undertaken
this difficult work. It was full of heavenly wisdom and of a large and
tolerant charity. Fénelon truly says, it is only perfection that can
tolerate imperfection; and the very purity of Lady Byron's nature made
her most forbearing and most tender towards the weak and the guilty.
This letter, with all the rest of Lady Byron's, was returned to the
hands of her executors after her death. Its publication would greatly
assist the world in understanding the peculiarities of its writer's
character.

Lady Byron passed to a higher life in 1860.[25] After her death, I
looked for the publication of her Memoir and Letters as the event that
should give her the same opportunity of being known and judged by her
life and writings that had been so freely accorded to Lord Byron.

[Footnote 25: Miss Martineau's Biographical Sketches.]

She was, in her husband's estimation, a woman of genius. She was
the friend of many of the first men and women of her times, and
corresponded with them on topics of literature, morals, religion,
and, above all, on the benevolent and philanthropic movements of the
day, whose principles she had studied with acute observation, and in
connection with which she had acquired a large experience.

The knowledge of her, necessarily diffused by such a series of letters,
would have created in America a comprehension of her character, of
itself sufficient to wither a thousand slanders.

Such a Memoir was contemplated. Lady Byron's letters to Mrs. Follen
were asked for from Boston; and I was applied to by a person in
England, who I have recently learned is one of the existing trustees
of Lady Byron's papers, to furnish copies of her letters to me for the
purpose of a Memoir. Before I had time to have copies made, another
letter came, stating that the trustees had concluded that it was best
not to publish any Memoir of Lady Byron at all.

This left the character of Lady Byron in our American world precisely
where the slanders of her husband, the literature of the Noctes Club,
and the unanimous verdict of May Fair as recorded by 'Blackwood,' had
placed it.

True, Lady Byron had nobly and quietly lived down these slanders in
England by deeds that made her name revered as a saint among all those
who valued saintliness.

But in France and Italy, and in these United States, I have had
abundant opportunity to know that Lady Byron stood judged and condemned
on the testimony of her brilliant husband, and that the feeling against
her had a vivacity and intensity not to be overcome by mere allusions
to a virtuous life in distant England.

This is strikingly shown by one fact. In the American edition of
Moore's 'Life of Byron,' by Claxton, Remsen, and Haffelfinger,
Philadelphia, 1869, which I have been consulting, Lady Byron's
statement, which is found in the Appendix of Murray's standard edition,
is entirely omitted. Every other paper is carefully preserved. This
one incident showed how the tide of sympathy was setting in this New
World. Of course, there is no stronger power than a virtuous life; but,
for a virtuous life to bear testimony to the world, its details must be
told, so that the world may know them.

Suppose the memoirs of Clarkson and Wilberforce had been suppressed
after their death, how soon might the coming tide have wiped out the
record of their bravery and philanthropy! Suppose the lives of Francis
Xavier and Henry Martyn had never been written, and we had lost the
remembrance of what holy men could do and dare in the divine enthusiasm
of Christian faith! Suppose we had no Fénelon, no Book of Martyrs!

Would there not be an outcry through all the literary and artistic
world if a perfect statue were allowed to remain buried for ever
because some painful individual history was connected with its burial
and its recovery? But is not a noble life a greater treasure to mankind
than any work of art?

We have heard much mourning over the burned Autobiography of Lord
Byron, and seen it treated of in a magazine as 'the lost chapter in
history.' The lost chapter in history is Lady Byron's Autobiography
in her life and letters; and the suppression of them is the root of
this whole mischief.

We do not in this intend to censure the parties who came to this
decision.

The descendants of Lady Byron revere her memory, as they have every
reason to do. That it was their desire to have a Memoir of her
published, I have been informed by an individual of the highest
character in England, who obtained the information directly from Lady
Byron's grandchildren.

But the trustees in whose care the papers were placed drew back on
examination of them, and declared, that, as Lady Byron's papers could
not be fully published, they should regret anything that should call
public attention once more to the discussion of her history.

Reviewing this long history of the way in which the literary world
had treated Lady Byron, we cannot wonder that her friends should have
doubted whether there was left on earth any justice, or sense that
anything is due to woman as a human being with human rights. Evidently
this lesson had taken from them all faith in the moral sense of the
world. Rather than re-awaken the discussion, so unsparing, so painful,
and so indelicate, which had been carried on so many years around
that loved form, now sanctified by death, they sacrificed the dear
pleasure of the memorials, and the interests of mankind, who have an
indefeasible right to all the help that can be got from the truth of
history as to the living power of virtue, and the reality of that great
victory that overcometh the world.

There are thousands of poor victims suffering in sadness,
discouragement, and poverty; heart-broken wives of brutal, drunken
husbands; women enduring nameless wrongs and horrors which the delicacy
of their sex forbids them to utter,--to whom the lovely letters lying
hidden away under those seals might bring courage and hope from springs
not of this world.

But though the friends of Lady Byron, perhaps from despair of their
kind, from weariness of the utter injustice done her, wished to cherish
her name in silence, and to confine the story of her virtues to that
circle who knew her too well to ask a proof, or utter a doubt, the
partisans of Lord Byron were embarrassed with no such scruple.

Lord Byron had artfully contrived during his life to place his wife in
such an antagonistic position with regard to himself, that his intimate
friends were forced to believe that one of the two had deliberately
and wantonly injured the other. The published statement of Lady Byron
contradicted boldly and point-blank all the statement of her husband
concerning the separation; so that, unless she was convicted as a
false witness, he certainly was.

The best evidence of this is Christopher North's own shocked,
astonished statement, and the words of the Noctes Club.

The noble life that Lady Byron lived after this hushed every voice,
and silenced even the most desperate calumny, while she was in the
world. In the face of Lady Byron as the world saw her, of what use was
the talk of Clytemnestra, and the assertion that she had been a mean,
deceitful conspirator against her husband's honour in life, and stabbed
his memory after death?

But when she was in her grave, when her voice and presence and good
deeds no more spoke for her, and a new generation was growing up that
knew her not, then was the time selected to revive the assault on her
memory, and to say over her grave what none would ever have dared to
say of her while living.

During these last two years, I have been gradually awakening to the
evidence of a new crusade against the memory of Lady Byron, which
respected no sanctity,--not even that last and most awful one of death.

Nine years after her death, when it was fully understood that no
story on her side or that of her friends was to be forthcoming, then
her calumniators raked out from the ashes of her husband's sepulchre
all his bitter charges, to state them over in even stronger and more
indecent forms.

There seems to be reason to think that the materials supplied by Lord
Byron for such a campaign yet exist in society.

To 'The Noctes' of November 1824, there is the following note apropos
to a discussion of the Byron question:--

 'Byron's Memoirs, given by him to Moore, were burned, as everybody
 knows. But, before this, Moore had lent them to several persons. Mrs.
 Home Purvis, afterwards Viscountess of Canterbury, is known to have
 sat up all one night, in which, aided by her daughter, she had a
 copy made. I have the strongest reason for believing that one other
 person made a copy; for the description of the first twenty-four hours
 after the marriage ceremonial has been in my hands. Not until after
 the death of Lady Byron, and Hobhouse, who was the poet's literary
 executor, can the poet's Autobiography see the light; but I am
 certain it will be published.'

Thus speaks Mackenzie in a note to a volume of 'The Noctes,' published
in America in 1854. Lady Byron died in 1860.

Nine years after Lady Byron's death, when it was ascertained that her
story was not to see the light, when there were no means of judging
her character by her own writings, commenced a well-planned set of
operations to turn the public attention once more to Lord Byron, and
to represent him as an injured man, whose testimony had been unjustly
suppressed.

It was quite possible, supposing copies of the Autobiography to exist,
that this might occasion a call from the generation of to-day, in
answer to which the suppressed work might appear. This was a rather
delicate operation to commence; but the instrument was not wanting.
It was necessary that the subject should be first opened by some
irresponsible party, whom more powerful parties might, as by accident,
recognise and patronise, and on whose weakness they might build
something stronger.

Just such an instrument was to be found in Paris. The mistress of Lord
Byron could easily be stirred up and flattered to come before the world
with a book which should re-open the whole controversy; and she proved
a facile tool. At first, the work appeared prudently in French, and was
called 'Lord Byron jugé par les Témoins de sa Vie,' and was rather a
failure. Then it was translated into English, and published by Bentley.

The book was inartistic, and helplessly, childishly stupid as to any
literary merits,--a mere mass of gossip and twaddle; but after all,
when one remembers the taste of the thousands of circulating-library
readers, it must not be considered the less likely to be widely read
on that account. It is only once in a century that a writer of real
genius has the art to tell his story so as to take both the cultivated
few and the average many. De Foe and John Bunyan are almost the only
examples. But there is a certain class of reading that sells and
spreads, and exerts a vast influence, which the upper circles of
literature despise too much ever to fairly estimate its power.

However, the Guiccioli book did not want for patrons in the high places
of literature. The 'Blackwood'--the old classic magazine of England;
the defender of conservatism and aristocracy; the paper of Lockhart,
Wilson, Hogg, Walter Scott, and a host of departed grandeurs--was
deputed to usher into the world this book, and to recommend it and its
author to the Christian public of the nineteenth century.

The following is the manner in which 'Blackwood' calls attention to
it:--

 'One of the most beautiful of the songs of Béranger is that addressed
 to his Lisette, in which he pictures her, in old age, narrating to a
 younger generation the loves of their youth; decking his portrait with
 flowers at each returning spring, and reciting the verses that had
 been inspired by her vanished charms:--

  'Lorsque les yeux chercheront sous vos rides
  Les traits charmants qui m'auront inspiré,
  Des doux récits les jeunes gens avides,
  Diront: Quel fut cet ami tant pleuré?
  De mon amour peignez, s'il est possible,
  L'ardeur, l'ivresse, et même les soupçons,
  Et benne vieille, au coin d'un feu paisible
  De votre ami répétez les chansons.

  "On vous dira: Savait-il être aimable?
  Et sans rougir vous direz: Je l'aimais.
  D'un trait méchant se montra-t-il capable?
  Avec orgueil vous répondrez: Jamais!"'

 'This charming picture,' 'Blackwood' goes on to say, 'has been
 realised in the case of a poet greater than Béranger, and by a
 mistress more famous than Lisette. The Countess Guiccioli has at
 length given to the world her "Recollections of Lord Byron." The
 book first appeared in France under the title of "Lord Byron jugé
 par les Témoins de sa Vie," without the name of the countess. A
 more unfortunate designation could hardly have been selected. The
 "witnesses of his life" told us nothing but what had been told before
 over and over again; and the uniform and exaggerated tone of eulogy
 which pervaded the whole book was fatal to any claim on the part of
 the writer to be considered an impartial judge of the wonderfully
 mixed character of Byron.

 'When, however, the book is regarded as the avowed production of
 the Countess Guiccioli, it derives value and interest from its very
 faults.[26] There is something inexpressibly touching in the picture
 of the old lady calling up the phantoms of half a century ago; not
 faded and stricken by the hand of time, but brilliant and gorgeous as
 they were when Byron, in his manly prime of genius and beauty, first
 flashed upon her enraptured sight, and she gave her whole soul up to
 an absorbing passion, the embers of which still glow in her heart.

 [Footnote 26: The italics are mine.--H. B. S.]

 'To her there has been no change, no decay. The god whom she
 worshipped with all the ardour of her Italian nature at seventeen is
 still the "Pythian of the age" to her at seventy. To try such a book
 by the ordinary canons of criticism would be as absurd as to arraign
 the authoress before a jury of British matrons, or to prefer a bill of
 indictment against the Sultan for bigamy to a Middlesex grand jury.'

This, then, is the introduction which one of the oldest and most
classical periodicals of Great Britain gives to a very stupid book,
simply because it was written by Lord Byron's mistress. That fact, we
are assured, lends grace even to its faults.

Having brought the authoress upon the stage, the review now goes on to
define her position, and assure the Christian world that

 'The Countess Guiccioli was the daughter of an impoverished noble. At
 the age of sixteen, she was taken from a convent, and sold as third
 wife to the Count Guiccioli, who was old, rich, and profligate. A
 fouler prostitution never profaned the name of marriage. A short time
 afterwards, she accidentally met Lord Byron. Outraged and rebellious
 nature vindicated itself in the deep and devoted passion with which
 he inspired her. With the full assent of husband, father, and
 brother, and in compliance with the usages of Italian society, he was
 shortly afterwards installed in the office, and invested with all the
 privileges, of her "Cavalier Servente."'

It has been asserted that the Marquis de Boissy, the late husband of
this Guiccioli lady, was in the habit of introducing her in fashionable
circles as 'the Marquise de Boissy, my wife, formerly mistress to Lord
Byron'! We do not give the story as a verity; yet, in the review of
this whole history, we may be pardoned for thinking it quite possible.

The mistress, being thus vouched for and presented as worthy of
sympathy and attention by one of the oldest and most classic organs
of English literature, may now proceed in her work of glorifying the
popular idol, and casting abuse on the grave of the dead wife.

Her attacks on Lady Byron are, to be sure, less skilful and adroit
than those of Lord Byron. They want his literary polish and tact; but
what of that? 'Blackwood' assures us that even the faults of manner
derive a peculiar grace from the fact that the narrator is Lord Byron's
mistress; and so we suppose the literary world must find grace in
things like this:--

 'She has been called, after his words, the moral Clytemnestra of
 her husband. Such a surname is severe: but the repugnance we feel
 to condemning a woman cannot prevent our listening to the voice of
 justice, which tells us that the comparison is still in favour of
 the guilty one of antiquity; for she, driven to crime by fierce
 passion overpowering reason, at least only deprived her husband of
 physical life, and, in committing the deed, exposed herself to all its
 consequences; while Lady Byron left her husband at the very moment
 that she saw him struggling amid a thousand shoals in the stormy sea
 of embarrassments created by his marriage, and precisely when he more
 than ever required a friendly, tender, and indulgent hand to save him.

 'Besides, she shut herself up in silence a thousand times more cruel
 than Clytemnestra's poniard: that only killed the body; whereas
 Lady Byron's silence was destined to kill the soul,--and such a
 soul!--leaving the door open to calumny, and making it to be supposed
 that her silence was magnanimity destined to cover over frightful
 wrongs, perhaps even depravity. In vain did he, feeling his conscience
 at ease, implore some inquiry and examination. She refused; and the
 only favour she granted was to send him, one fine day, two persons to
 see whether he were not mad.

 'And, why, then, had she believed him mad? Because she, a methodical,
 inflexible woman, with that unbendingness which a profound moralist
 calls the worship rendered to pride by a feelingless soul,--because
 she could not understand the possibility of tastes and habits
 different to those of ordinary routine, or of her own starched life.
 Not to be hungry when she was; not to sleep at night, but to write
 while she was sleeping, and to sleep when she was up; in short, to
 gratify the requirements of material and intellectual life at hours
 different to hers,--all that was not merely annoying for her, but it
 must be madness; or, if not, it betokened depravity that she could
 neither submit to nor tolerate without perilling her own morality.

 'Such was the grand secret of the cruel silence which exposed Lord
 Byron to the most malignant interpretations, to all the calumny and
 revenge of his enemies.

 'She was, perhaps, the only woman in the world so strangely
 organised,--the only one, perhaps, capable of not feeling happy and
 proud at belonging to a man superior to the rest of humanity; and
 fatally was it decreed that this woman alone of her species should
 be Lord Byron's wife!'

In a note is added,--

 'If an imaginary fear, and even an unreasonable jealousy, may be her
 excuse (just as one excuses a monomania), can one equally forgive her
 silence? Such a silence is morally what are physically the poisons
 which kill at once, and defy all remedies; thus insuring the culprit's
 safety. This silence it is which will ever be her crime; for by it she
 poisoned the life of her husband.'

The book has several chapters devoted to Lord Byron's peculiar virtues;
and under the one devoted to magnanimity and heroism, his forgiving
disposition receives special attention. The climax of all is stated to
be that he forgave Lady Byron. All the world knew that, since he had
declared this fact in a very noisy and impassioned manner in the fourth
canto of 'Childe Harold,' together with a statement of the wrongs which
he forgave; but the Guiccioli thinks his virtue, at this period, has
not been enough appreciated. In her view, it rose to the sublime. She
says of Lady Byron,--

 'An absolute moral monstrosity, an anomaly in the history of types
 of female hideousness, had succeeded in showing itself in the light
 of magnanimity. But false as was this high quality in Lady Byron, so
 did it shine out in him true and admirable. The position in which
 Lady Byron had placed him, and where she continued to keep him by
 her harshness, silence, and strange refusals, was one of those which
 cause such suffering, that the highest degree of self-control seldom
 suffices to quiet the promptings of human weakness, and to cause
 persons of even slight sensibility to preserve moderation. Yet, with
 his sensibility and the knowledge of his worth, how did he act? what
 did he say? I will not speak of his "farewell;" of the care he took
 to shield her from blame by throwing it on others, by taking much too
 large a share to himself.'

With like vivacity and earnestness does the narrator now proceed to
make an incarnate angel of her subject by the simple process of denying
everything that he himself ever confessed,--everything that has ever
been confessed in regard to him by his best friends. He has been in
the world as an angel unawares from his cradle. His guardian did not
properly appreciate him, and is consequently mentioned as that wicked
Lord Carlisle. Thomas Moore is never to be sufficiently condemned
for the facts told in his biography. Byron's own frank and lawless
admissions of evil are set down to a peculiar inability he had for
speaking the truth about himself,--sometimes about his near relations;
all which does not in the least discourage the authoress from giving a
separate chapter on 'Lord Byron's Love of Truth.'

In the matter of his relations with women, she complacently repeats
(what sounds rather oddly as coming from her) Lord Byron's own
assurance, that he never seduced a woman; and also the equally
convincing statement, that he had told her (the Guiccioli) that his
married fidelity to his wife was perfect. She discusses Moore's account
of the mistress in boy's clothes who used to share Byron's apartments
in college, and ride with him to races, and whom he presented to
ladies as his brother.

She has her own view of this matter. The disguised boy was a lady
of rank and fashion, who sought Lord Byron's chambers, as, we are
informed, noble ladies everywhere, both in Italy and England, were
constantly in the habit of doing; throwing themselves at his feet, and
imploring permission to become his handmaids.

In the authoress's own words, 'Feminine overtures still continued
to be made to Lord Byron; but the fumes of incense never hid from
his sight his IDEAL.' We are told that in the case of
these poor ladies, generally 'disenchantment took place on his side
without a corresponding result on the other: THENCE many
heart-breakings.' Nevertheless, we are informed that there followed the
indiscretions of these ladies 'none of those proceedings that the world
readily forgives, but which his feelings as a man of honour would have
condemned.'

As to drunkenness, and all that, we are informed he was an anchorite.
Pages are given to an account of the biscuits and soda-water that on
this and that occasion were found to be the sole means of sustenance to
this ethereal creature.

As to the story of using his wife's money, the lady gives, directly in
the face of his own Letters and Journal, the same account given before
by Medwin, and which caused such merriment when talked over in the
Noctes Club,--that he had with her only a marriage portion of £10,000;
and that, on the separation, he not only paid it back, but doubled
it.[27]

[Footnote 27: In 'The Noctes' of November, 1824 Christopher North says,
'I don't call Medwin a liar.... Whether Byron bammed him, or he, by
virtue of his own stupidity, was the sole and sufficient bammifier of
himself, I know not.' A note says that Murray had been much shocked by
Byron's misstatements to Medwin as to money-matters with him. The note
goes on to say, 'Medwin could not have invented them, for they were
mixed up with acknowledged facts; and the presumption is that Byron
mystified his gallant acquaintance. He was fond of such tricks.']

So on the authoress goes, sowing right and left the most transparent
absurdities and misstatements with what Carlyle well calls 'a composed
stupidity, and a cheerful infinitude of ignorance.' Who should know,
if not she, to be sure? Had not Byron told her all about it? and was
not his family motto Crede Byron?

The 'Blackwood,' having a dim suspicion that this confused style of
attack and defence in reference to the two parties under consideration
may not have great weight, itself proceeds to make the book an occasion
for re-opening the controversy of Lord Byron with his wife.

The rest of the review is devoted to a powerful attack on Lady Byron's
character,--the most fearful attack on the memory of a dead woman we
have ever seen made by living man. The author proceeds, like a lawyer,
to gather up, arrange, and restate, in a most workmanlike manner, the
confused accusations of the book.

Anticipating the objection, that such a re-opening of the inquiry was
a violation of the privacy due to womanhood and to the feelings of a
surviving family, he says, that though marriage usually is a private
matter which the world has no right to intermeddle with or discuss,
yet--

 'Lord Byron's was an exceptional case. It is not too much to say,
 that, had his marriage been a happy one, the course of events of the
 present century might have been materially changed; that the genius
 which poured itself forth in "Don Juan" and "Cain" might have flowed
 in far different channels; that the ardent love of freedom which sent
 him to perish at six and thirty at Missolonghi might have inspired
 a long career at home; and that we might at this moment have been
 appealing to the counsels of his experience and wisdom at an age
 not exceeding that which was attained by Wellington, Lyndhurst, and
 Brougham.

 'Whether the world would have been a gainer or a loser by the exchange
 is a question which every man must answer for himself, according to
 his own tastes and opinions; but the possibility of such a change in
 the course of events warrants us in treating what would otherwise be a
 strictly private matter as one of public interest.

 'More than half a century has elapsed, the actors have departed from
 the stage, the curtain has fallen; and whether it will ever again be
 raised so as to reveal the real facts of the drama, may, as we have
 already observed, be well doubted. But the time has arrived when we
 may fairly gather up the fragments of evidence, clear them as far as
 possible from the incrustations of passion, prejudice, and malice, and
 place them in such order, as, if possible, to enable us to arrive
 at some probable conjecture as to what the skeleton of the drama
 originally was.'

Here the writer proceeds to put together all the facts of Lady Byron's
case, just as an adverse lawyer would put them as against her, and
for her husband. The plea is made vigorously and ably, and with an
air of indignant severity, as of an honest advocate who is thoroughly
convinced that he is pleading the cause of a wronged man who has been
ruined in name, ship-wrecked in life, and driven to an early grave, by
the arts of a bad woman,--a woman all the more horrible that her malice
was disguised under the cloak of religion.

Having made an able statement of facts, adroitly leaving out
ONE,[28] of which he could not have been ignorant had he
studied the case carefully enough to know all the others, he proceeds
to sum up against the criminal thus:--

[Footnote 28: This one fact is, that Lord Byron might have had an open
examination in court, if he had only persisted in refusing the deed of
separation.]

 'We would deal tenderly with the memory of Lady Byron. Few women have
 been juster objects of compassion. It would seem as if Nature and
 Fortune had vied with each other which should be most lavish of her
 gifts, and yet that some malignant power had rendered all their bounty
 of no effect. Rank, beauty, wealth, and mental powers of no common
 order, were hers; yet they were of no avail to secure her happiness.
 The spoilt child of seclusion, restraint, and parental idolatry,
 a fate (alike evil for both) cast her into the arms of the spoilt
 child of genius, passion, and the world. What real or fancied wrongs
 she suffered, we may never know; but those which she inflicted are
 sufficiently apparent.

 'It is said that there are some poisons so subtle that they will
 destroy life, and yet leave no trace of their action. The murderer
 who uses them may escape the vengeance of the law; but he is not the
 less guilty. So the slanderer who makes no charge; who deals in hints
 and insinuations: who knows melancholy facts he would not willingly
 divulge,--things too painful to state; who forbears, expresses pity,
 sometimes even affection, for his victim, shrugs his shoulders, looks
 with

        "The significant eye,
  Which learns to lie with silence,--"

 is far more guilty than he who tells the bold falsehood which may be
 met and answered, and who braves the punishment which must follow upon
 detection.

 'Lady Byron has been called

  "The moral Clytemnestra of her lord."

 The "moral Brinvilliers" would have been a truer designation.

 'The conclusion at which we arrive is, that there is no proof whatever
 that Lord Byron was guilty of any act that need have caused a
