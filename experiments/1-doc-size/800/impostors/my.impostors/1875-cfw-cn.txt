"Jeannette," he said, going toward her, "I have come 
to take you away with me. You need not go to school; 
I have given up that idea, I accept you as you 
are. You shall have silk dresses and ribbons, like the 



 

ladies at the Mission-House this summer. You shall 
see all the great cities, you shall hear beautiful music. 
You shall have everything you want, money, bright 
shillings, as many as you wish. See! Mrs. Corlyne 
has come with me to show you that it is true. This 
morning we had orders to leave Mackinac ; in a few 
days we must go. But listen, Jeannette ; I will 
marry you. You shall be my wife. Do not look so 
startled. I mean it; it is really true." 

" Qu'est-ce-que-c'est ? " said the girl, bewildered by 
the rapid, eager words. 

"Dr. Prescott wishes to marry you, child," I ex- 
plained, somewhat sadly, for never had the disparity 
between them seemed so great. The presence of the 
Indian mother, the common room, were like silent 
protests. 

" Marry ! " ejaculated Jeannette. 

" Yes, love," said the surgeon, ardently. " It is quite 
true ; you shall be my wife. Father Piret shall marry 
us. I will exchange into another regiment, or, if ne- 
cessary, I will resign. Do you understand what I am 
saying, Jeannette? See! I give you my hand, in 
token that it is true." 

But, with a quick bound, the girl was across the 
room. " What ! " she cried. " You think I marry you ? 
Have you not heard of Baptiste ? Know, then, that 
I love one finger of him more than all you, ten times, 
hundred times." 



 

"Baptiste?" repeated Eodney. 

" Oui, mon cousin, Baptiste, the fisherman. "We 
marry soon tenez la fete de Saint Andr&" 

Eodney looked bewildered a moment, then his face 
cleared. " Oh ! a child engagement ? That is one of 
your customs, I know. But never fear; Father Piret 
will absolve you from all that. Baptiste shall have 
a fine new boat ; he will let you off for a handful of 
silver-pieces. Do not think of that, Jeannette, but 
come to me " 

" Je vous abkorre ; je, voiis d&este," cried the girl 
with fury as he approached. " Baptiste not love me ? 
He love me more than boat and silver dollar, more 
than all the world ! And I love him ; I die for him ! 
Allez-vous-en, traitre ! " 

Eodney had grown white; he stood before her, 
motionless, with fixed eyes. 

" Jeannette," I said in French, " perhaps you do not 
understand. Dr. Prescott asks you to marry him ; 
Father Piret shall marry you, and all your friends 
shall come. Dr. Prescott will take you away from 
this hard life ; he will make you rich ; he will support 
your father and mother in comfort. My child, it is 
wonderful good fortune. He is an educated gentle- 
man, and loves .you truly." 

" What is that to me ? " replied Jeannette, proudly. 
"Let him go, I care not." She paused a moment. 
Then, with flashing eyes, she cried, " Let' him go with 



 

his fine new boat and silver dollars ! He does not 
believe me ? See, then, how I despise him ! " And, 
rushing forward, she struck him on the cheek. 

Eodney did not stir, but stood gazing at her while 
the red mark glowed on his white face. 

"You know not what love is," said Jeannette, with 
indescribable scorn. " You ! You ! Ah, mon Baptiste, 
ou es-tu? But thou wilt kill him, kill him for his 
boats and silver dollars ! " 

" Child ! " I said, startled by her fury. 

" I am not a child. Je suis femme, moi I " replied 
Jeannette, folding her arms with haughty grace. 
"Allez!" she said, pointing toward the door. We 
were dismissed. A queen could not have made a 
more royal gesture. 

Throughout the scene the Indian mother had not 
stopped her knitting. 

In four days we were afloat, and the little white fort 
was deserted. It was a dark afternoon, and we sat 
clustered on the stern of the steamer, watching the flag 
come slowly down from its staff in token of the de- 
parture of the commanding officer. " Isle of Beauty, 
fare thee well," sang the major's fair young wife, with 
the sound of tears in her sweet voice. . 

"We shall return," said the officers. But not one 
of them ever saw the beautiful island again. 

Eodney Prescott served a month or two in Florida, 



 

"taciturn and stiff as ever," Archie wrote. Then he 
resigned suddenly, and went abroad. He has never 
returned, and I have lost all trace of him, so that I 
cannot say, from any knowledge of my own, how long 
the feeling lived, the feeling that swept me along in 
its train down to the beach- cottage that wild night. 

Each man who reads this can decide for himself. 

Each woman has decided already. 

Last year I met an islander on the cars, going east- 
ward. It was the first time he had ever been "be- 
low " ; but he saw nothing to admire, that dignified 
citizen of Mackinac ! 

" What has become of Jeannette Leblanc ? " I 
asked. 

" Jeannette ? O, she married that Baptiste, a lazy, 
good-for-nothing fellow ! They live in the same little 
cabin round the point, and pick up a living most any- 
how for their tribe of young ones." 

"Are they happy?" 

" Happy ? " repeated my islander, with a slow stare. 
" Well, I suppose they are, after their fashion ; I don't 
know much about them. In my opinion, they are a 
shiftless set, those French half-breeds round the point." 



THE OLD AGENCY. 



" The buildings of the United States Indian Agency on the island 
of Mackinac were destroyed by fire December 31, at midnight." 
Western Newspaper Item. 

THE old house is gone then ! But it shall not 
depart into oblivion unchronicled. One who 
has sat under its roof-tree, one who remembers well 
its rambling rooms and wild garden, will take the 
pen to write down a page of its story. It is only 
an episode, one of many ; but the others are fading 
away, or already buried in dead memories under the 
sod. It was a quaint, picturesque old place, stretch- 
ing back from the white limestone road that bor- 
dered the little port, its overgrown garden surrounded 
by an ancient stockade ten feet in height, with a 
massive, slow-swinging gate in front, defended by 
loopholes. This stockade bulged out in some places 
and leaned in at others ; but the veteran posts, each 
A tree sharpened to a point, did not break their ranks, 
in spite of decrepitude ; and the Indian warriors, could 
they have returned from their happy hunting-grounds, 
would have found the brave old fence of the Agency 




a sturdy barrier still. But the Indian warriors could 
not return. The United States agent had long ago 
moved to Lake Superior, and the deserted residence, 
having only a mythical owner, left without repairs 
year after year, and under a cloud of confusion as 
regarded taxes, titles, and boundaries, became a sort 
of flotsam property, used by various persons, but be- 
longing legally to no one. Some tenant, tired of 
swinging the great gate back and forth, had made a 
little sally port alongside, but otherwise the place 
remained unaltered; a broad garden with a central 
avenue of cherry-trees, on each side dilapidated ar- 
bors, overgrown paths, and heart-shaped beds, where 
the first agents had tried to cultivate flowers, and 
behind the limestone cliffs crowned with cedars. The 
house was large on the ground, with wings and va- 
rious additions built out as if at random ; on each 
side and behind were rough outside chimneys clamped 
to the wall ; in the roof over the central part dormer- 
windows showed a low second story; and here and 
there at irregular intervals were outside doors, in some 
cases opening out into space, since the high steps 
which once led up to them had fallen down, and re- 
mained as they fell, heaps of stones on the ground 
below. Within were suites of rooms, large and small, 
showing traces of workmanship elaborate for such a 
remote locality ; the ceilings, patched with rough mor- 
tar, had been originally decorated with moulding, the 



 

doors were ornamented with scroll-work, and the two 
large apartments on each side of the entrance-hall 
possessed chimney-pieces and central hooks for chan- 
deliers. Beyond and behind stretched out the wings j 
coming to what appeared to be the end of the house 
on the west, there unexpectedly began a new series 
of rooms turning toward the north, each with its out- 
side door; looking for a corresponding labyrinth on 
the eastern side, there was nothing but a blank wall 
The blind stairway went up in a kind of dark well, 
and once up it was a difficult matter to get down 
without a plunge from top to bottom, since the un- 
defended opening was just where no one would expect 
to find it. Sometimes an angle was so arbitrarily 
walled up that you felt sure there must be a secret 
chamber there, and furtively rapped on the wall to 
catch the hollow echo within. Then again you 
opened a door, expecting to step out into the wil- 
derness of a garden, and found yourself in a set of 
little rooms running off on a tangent, one after the 
other, and ending in a windowless closet and an open 
cistern. But the Agency gloried in its irregularities, 
and defied criticism. The original idea of its archi- 
tect if there was any had vanished ; but his 
work remained, a not unpleasing variety to summer 
visitors accustomed to city houses, all built with a 
definite purpose, and one front door. 

After some years of wandering in foreign lands, I 



 

returned to my own country, and took up the burden 
of old associations whose sadness time had mercifully 
softened. The summer was over; September had be- 
gun, but there came to me a great wish to see Mack- 
inac once more; to look again upon the little white 
fort where I had lived with Archie, my soldier nephew, 
killed at Shiloh. The steamer took me safely across 
Erie, up the brimming Detroit Kiver, through the en- 
chanted region of the St. Glair flats, and out into broad 
Lake Huron ; there, off Thunder Bay, a gale met us, 
and for hours we swayed between life and death. The 
season for pleasure travelling was over; my fellow- 
passengers, with one exception, were of that class of 
Americans who, dressed in cheap imitations of fine 
clothes, are forever travelling, travelling, taking the 
steamers not from preference, but because they are less 
costly than an all-rail route. The thin, listless men, in 
ill-fitting black clothes and shining tall hats, sat on the 
deck in tilted chairs, hour after hour, silent and dreary ; 
the thin, listless women, clad in raiment of many col- 
ors, remained upon the fixed sofas in the cabin hour 
after hour, silent and weary. At meals they ate indis- 
criminately everything within range, but continued the 
same, a weary, dreary, silent band. The one exception 
was an old man, tall and majestic, with silvery hair 
and bright, dark eyes, dressed in the garb of a Eoman 
Catholic priest, albeit slightly tinged with frontier 
innovations. He came on board at Detroit, and as 



 

soon as we were under way he exchanged his hat for 
a cloth cap embroidered with Indian bead- work; and 
when the cold air, precursor of the gale, struck us on 
Huron, he wrapped himself in a large capote made of 
skins, with the fur inward. 

In times of danger formality drops from us. During 
those long hours, when the next moment might have 
brought death, this old man and I were together ; and 
when at last the cold dawn came, and the disabled 
steamer slowly ploughed through the angry water 
around the point, and showed us Mackinac in the 
distance, we discovered that the island was a mutual 
friend, and that we knew each other, at least by name ; 
for the silver-haired priest was Father Piret, the hermit 
of the Chenaux. In the old days, when I was living 
at the little white fort, I had known Father Piret by 
reputation, and he had heard of me from the French 
half-breeds around the point. We landed. The sum- 
mer hotels were closed, and I was directed to the old 
Agency, where occasionally a boarder was received by 
x the family then in possession. The air was chilly, and 
a fine rain was falling, the afterpiece of the equinoctial ; 
the wet storm-flag hung heavily down over the fort on 
the height, and the waves came in sullenly. All was 
in sad accordance with my feelings as I thought of the 
past and its dead, while the slow tears of age moistened 
my eyes. But the next morning Mackinac awoke, 
robed in autumn splendor ; the sunshine poured down, 



 

the straits sparkled back, the forest glowed in scarlet, 
the larches waved their wild, green hands, the fair- 
weather flag floated over the little fort, and all was as 
joyous as though no one had ever died ; and indeed it 
is in glorious days like these that we best realize 
immortality. 

I wandered abroad through the gay forest to the 
Arch, the Lovers' Leap, and old Fort Holmes, whose 
British walls had been battered down for pastime, 
so that only a caved-in British cellar remained to 
mark the spot, Eeturning to the Agency, I learned 
that Father Piret had called to see me. 

" I am soiTy that I missed him," I said j " he is a 
remarkable old man." 

The circle at the dinner-table glanced up with one 
accord. The little Methodist minister with the sur- 
prised eyes looked at me more surprised than ever; 
his large wife groaned audibly. The Baptist colporteur 
peppered his potatoes until they and the plate were 
black ; the Presbyterian doctor, who was the champion 
of the Protestant party on the island, wished to know 
if I was acquainted with the latest devices of the Scar- 
let Woman in relation to the county school-fund. 

" But, my friends," I replied, " Father Piret and I 
both belong to the past. We discuss not religion, but 
Mackinac; not the school- fund, but the old associations 
of the island, which is dear to both of us." 

The four looked at me with distrust ; they saw noth- 



 

ing dear about the island, unless it was the price of 
fresh meat ; and as to old associations, they held them- 
selves above such nonsense. So, one and all, they took 
beef and enjoyed a season of well-regulated conversa- 
tion, leaving me to silence and my broiled white-fish ; 
as it was Friday, no doubt they thought the latter a 
rag of popery. 

Very good rags. 

But my hostess, a gentle little woman, stole away 
from these bulwarks of Protestantism in the late after- 
noon, and sought me in my room, or rather series of 
rooms, since there were five opening one out of the 
other, the last three unfurnished, and all the doorless 
doorways staring at me like so many fixed eyes, until, 
oppressed by their silent watchfulness, I hung a shawl 
over the first opening and shut out the whole gazing 
suite. 

" You must not think, Mrs. Corlyne, that we island- 
ers do not appreciate Father Piret," said the little 
woman, who belonged to one of the old island families, 
descendants of a chief factor of the fur trade. " There 
has been some feeling lately against the Catholics " 

" Ptoman Catholics, my dear," I said with Anglican 
particularity. 

" But we all love and respect the dear old man as a 
father." 

" When I was living at the fort, fifteen years ago, I 
heard occasionally of Father Piret," I said, "but he 



 

seemed to be almost a mythic personage. What is his 
history ? " 

" No one knows. He came here fifty years ago, and 
after officiating on the island a few years, he retired to 
a little Indian farm in the Chenaux, where he has lived 
ever since. Occasionally he holds a service for the 
half-breeds at Point St. Ignace, but the parish of Mack- 
inac proper has its regular priest, and Father Piret ap- 
parently does not hold even the appointment of mis- 
sionary. Why he remains here a man educated, 
refined, and even aristocratic is a mystery. He 
seems to be well provided with money ; his little house 
in the Chenaux contains foreign books and pictures, 
and he is very charitable to the poor Indians. But he 
keeps himself aloof, and seems to desire no intercourse 
with the world beyond his letters and papers, which 
come regularly, some of them from France. He seldom 
leaves the Straits; he never speaks of himself; always 
he appears as you saw him, carefully dressed and 
stately. Each summer when he is seen on the street, 
there is more or less curiosity about him among the 
summer visitors, for he is quite unlike the rest of us 
Mackinac people. But no one can discover anything 
more than I have told you, and those who have per- 
sisted so far as to sail over to the Chenaux either lose 
their way among the channels, or if they find the 
house, they never find him ; the door is locked, and no 
one answers." 



 

" Singular," I said. " He has nothing of the hermit 
about him, He has what I should call a courtly man- 
ner." 

"That is it/' replied my hostess, taking up the 
word ; " some say he came from the French court, a 
nobleman exiled for political offences ; others think 
he is a priest under the ban ; and there is still a third 
story, to the effect that he is a French count, who, 
owing to a disappointment in love, took orders and 
came to this far-away island, so that he might seclude 
himself forever from the world." 

" But no one really knows ? " 

" Absolutely nothing. He is beloved by all the real 
old island families, whether they are of his faith or 
not; and when he dies the whole Strait, from Bois 
Blanc light to far Waugoschance, will mourn for him." 

At sunset the Father came again to see me ; the front 
door of my room was open, and we seated ourselves on 
the piazza outside. The roof of bark thatch had fallen 
away, leaving the bare beams overhead twined with 
brier-roses ; the floor and house side were frescoed 
with those lichen-colored spots which show that the 
gray planks have lacked paint for many long years; 
the windows had wooden shutters fastened back with 
irons shaped like the letter S, and on the central door 
was a brass knocker, and a plate bearing the words, 
" United States Agency." 

"When I first came to the island," said Father Piret, 



 

" this was the residence par excellence. The old house 
was brave with green and white paint then ; it had 
candelabra on its high mantles, brass andirons on its 
many hearthstones, curtains for all its little windows, 
and carpets for all its uneven floors. Much cooking 
went on, and smoke curled up from all these outside 
chimneys. Those were the days of the fur trade, and 
Mackinac was a central mart. Hither twice a year 
came the bateaux from the Northwest, loaded with 
furs ; and in those old, decaying warehouses on the back 
street of the village were stored the goods sent out 
from New York, with which the bateaux were loaded 
again, and after a few days of revelry, during which 
the improvident voyagers squandered all their hard- 
earned gains, the train returned westward into 'the 
countries,' as they called the wilderness beyond the 
lakes, for another six months of toil. The officers of 
the little fort on the height, the chief factors of the fur 
company, and the United States Indian agent, formed 
the feudal aristocracy of the island; but the agent 
had the most imposing mansion, and often have I seen 
the old house shining with lights across its whole 
broadside of windows, and gay with the sound of a 
dozen French violins. The garden, now a wilderness, 
was the pride of the island. Its prim arbors, its spring 
and spring-house, its flower-beds, where, with infinite 
pains, a few hardy plants were induced to blossom ; its 
cherry-tree avenue, whose early red fruit the short 



 

summer could scarcely ripen ; its annual attempts at 
vegetables, which never came to maturity, formed 
topics for conversation in court circles. Potatoes then 
as now were left to the mainland Indians, who came 
over with their canoes heaped with the fine, large thin- 
jacketed fellows, bartering them all for a loaf or two 
of bread and a little whiskey. 

"The stockade which surrounds the place was at 
that day a not unnecessary defence. At the time of 
the payments the island swarmed with Indians, who 
came from Lake Superior and the Northwest, to receive 
the government pittance. Camped on the beach as far 
as the eye could reach, these wild warriors, dressed in 
all their savage finery, watched the Agency with greedy 
eyes, as they waited for their turn. The great gate 
was barred, and sentinels stood at the loopholes with 
loaded muskets ; one by one the chiefs were admitted, 
stalked up to the office, that wing on the right, 
received the allotted sum, silently selected something 
from the displayed goods, and as silently departed, 
watched by quick eyes, until the great gate closed 
behind them. The guns of the fort were placed so 
as to command the Agency during payment time ; and 
when, after several anxious, watchful days and nights, 
the last brave had received his portion, and the last 
canoe started away toward the north, leaving only the 
comparatively peaceful mainland Indians behind, the 
island drew a long breath of relief." 



 

" Was there any real danger ? " I asked. 

" The Indians are ever treacherous/' replied the Fa- 
ther. Then he was silent, and seemed lost in revery. 
The pure, ever-present breeze of Mackinac played in 
his long silvery hair, and his bright eyes roved along 
the wall of the old house; he had a broad forehead, 
noble features, and commanding presence, and as he 
sat there, recluse as he was, aged, alone, without a 
history, with scarcely a name or a place in the world, 
he looked, in the power of his native-born dignity, 
worthy of a royal coronet. 

" I was thinking of old Jacques," he said, after a long 
pause. " He once lived in these rooms of yours, and 
died on that bench at the end of the piazza, sitting in 
the sunshine, with his staff in his hand." 

"Who was he ?" I asked. "Tell me the story, Fa- 
ther." 

"There is not much to tell, madame; but in my 
mind he is so associated with this old house, that I 
always think of him when I come here, and fancy I 
see him 'on that bench. 

"When the United States agent removed to the 
Apostle Islands, at the western' end of Lake Superior, 
this place remained for some time uninhabited. But 
one winter morning smoke was seen coming out of 
that great chimney on the side ; and in the course of 
the day several curious persons endeavored to open the 
main gate, at that time the only entrance. But the 



 

gate was barred within, and as the high stockade was 
slippery with ice, for some days the mystery remained 
unsolved. The islanders, always slow, grow torpid in 
the winter like bears ; they watched the smoke in the 
daytime and the little twinkling light by night ; they 
talked of spirits both French and Indian as they went 
their rounds, but they were too indolent to do more. 
At length the fort commandant heard of the smoke, 
and saw the light from his quarters on the height. As 
government property, he considered the Agency under 
his charge, and he was preparing to send a detail of 
men to examine the deserted mansion in its ice-bound 
garden, when its mysterious occupant appeared in the 
village; it was an old man, silent, gentle, apparently 
French. He carried a canvas bag, and bought a few 
supplies of the coarsest description, as though he was 
very poor. Unconscious of observation, he made his 
purchases and returned slowly homeward, barring the 
great gate behind him. Who was he ? No one knew. 
Whence and when came he ? No one could tell 

"The d*etail of soldiers from the fort battered at 
the gate, and when the silent old man opened it they 
followed him through the garden, where his feet 
had made a lonely trail over the deep snow, round 
to the side door. They entered, and found some 
blankets on the floor, a fire of old knots on the hearth, 
a long narrow box tied with a rope; his poor little 
supplies stood in one corner, bread, salted fish, and 



 

a few potatoes, and over the fire hung a rusty tea- 
kettle, its many holes carefully plugged with bits of 
rag. It was a desolate scene; the old man in the 
great rambling empty house in the heart of an arctic 
winter. He said little, and the soldiers could not un- 
derstand his language ; but they left him unmolested, 
and going back to the fort, they told what they had 
seen. Then the major went in person to the Agency, 
and gathered from the stranger's words that he had 
come to the island over the ice in the track of the 
mail-carrier ; that he was an emigrant from France on 
his way to the Red Eiver of the North, but his strength 
failing, owing to the intense cold, he had stopped at 
the island, and seeing the uninhabited house, he had 
crept into it, as he had not enough money, to pay for 
a lodging elsewhere. He seemed a quiet, inoffensive 
old man, and after all the islanders had had a good long 
slow stare at him, he was left in peace, with his little 
curling smoke by day and his little twinkling light by 
night, although no one thought of assisting him ; there is 
a strange coldness of heart in these northern latitudes. 
"I was then living at the Chenaux; there was a 
German priest on the island; I sent over two half- 
breeds every ten days for the mail, and through them . 
I heard of the stranger at the Agency. He was 
French, they said, and it was rumored in the saloons 
along the frozen docks that he had seen Paris. This 
warmed my heart ; for, madame, I spent my youth in 



 

Paris, the dear, the beautiful city ! So I came over 
to the island in my dog-sledge ; a little thing is an 
event in oar long, long winter. I reached the village 
in the afternoon twilight, and made my way alone to 
the Agency; the old man no longer barred his gate, 
and swinging it open with difficulty, I followed the 
trail through the snowy silent garden round to the 
side door of this wing, the wing you occupy. I 
knocked ; he opened ; I greeted him, and entered. He 
had tried to furnish his little room with the broken 
relics of the deserted dwelling; a mended chair, a 
stool, a propped-up table, a shelf with two or three 
battered tin dishes, and some straw in one corner 
comprised the whole equipment, but the floor was 
clean, the old dishes polished, and the blankets neatly 
spread over the straw which formed the bed. On the 
table the supplies were ranged in order ; there was a 
careful pile of knots on one side of the hearth, and 
the fire was evidently husbanded to last as long as 
possible. He gave me the mended chair, lighted a 
candle-end stuck in a bottle, and then seating him- 
self on the stool, he gazed at me in his silent way 
until I felt like an uncourteous intruder. I spoke to 
him in French, offered my services; in short, I did 
my best to break down the barrier of his reserve ; 
there was something pathetic in the little room and 
its lonely occupant, and, besides, I knew by his accent 
that we were both from the banks of the Seine. 



 

" Well, I heard his story, not then, but afterward ; 
it came out gradually during the eleven months of our 
acquaintance; for he became my friend, almost the 
only friend of fifty years. I am an isolated man, 
niadame. It must be so. God's will be done ! " 

The Father paused, and looked off over the darkening 
water ; he did not sigh, neither was his calm brow 
clouded, but there was in his face what seemed to me 
a noble resignation, and I have ever, since felt sure that 
the secret of his exile held in it a self-sacrifice; for 
only self-sacrifice can produce that divine expression. 

Out in the straits shone the low-down green light of 
a schooner ; beyond glimmered the mast-head star of a 
steamer, with the line of cabin lights below, and away 
on the point of Bois Blanc gleamed the steady radiance 
of the lighthouse showing the way into Lake Huron ; 
the broad overgrown garden cut us off from the village, 
but above on the height we could see the lighted win- 
dows of the fort, although still the evening sky retained 
that clear hue that seems so much like daylight when 
one looks aloft, although the earth lies in dark shadows 
below. The Agency was growing indistinct even to 
our near eyes; its white chimneys loomed up like 
ghosts, the shutters sighed in the breeze, and the 
planks of the piazza creaked causelessly. The old 
house was full of the spirits of memories, and at twi- 
light they came abroad and bewailed themselves. 
"The place is haunted," I said, as a distant door 
groaned drearily. 



 

"Yes," replied Father Piret, coming out of his ab- 
straction, " and this wing is haunted by my old French 
friend. As time passed and the spring came, he fitted 
tip in his fashion the whole suite of five rooms. He 
had his parlor, sleeping-rooni, kitchen, and store-room, 
the whole furnished only with the articles I have 
already described, save that the bed was of fresh green 
boughs instead of straw. Jacques occupied all the 
rooms with ceremqnious exactness ; he sat in the par- 
lor, and I too must sit there when I came ; in the sec- 
ond room he slept and made his careful toilet, with his 
shabby old clothes ; the third was his kitchen and din- 
ing-room ; and the fourth, that little closet on the right, 
was his store-room. His one indulgence was coffee ; 
coffee he must and would have, though he slept on 
straw and went without meat. But he cooked to per- 
fection in his odd way, and I have often eaten a dainty 
meal in that little kitchen, sitting at the propped-up 
table, using the battered tin dishes, and the clumsy 
wooden spoons fashioned with a jack-knife. After we 
had become friends Jacques would accept occasional 
aid from me, and it gave me a warm pleasure to think 
that I had added something to bis comfort, were it only 
a little sugar, butter, or a pint of milk. No one dis- 
turbed the old man ; no orders came from "Washington 
respecting the Agency property, and the major had not 
the heart to order him away. There were more than 
houses enough for the scanty population of the island, 



 

and only a magnate could furnish these large rambling 
rooms. So the soldiers were sent down to pick the red 
cherries for the use of the garrison, but otherwise 
Jacques had the whole place to himself, with all its 
wings, outbuildings, arbors, and garden beds. 

" But I have not told you all. The fifth apartment 
in the suite the square room with four windows and 
an outside door was the old man's sanctuary; here 
were his precious relics, and here he offered up his 
devotions, half Christian, half pagan, with never-failing 
ardor. From the long narrow box which the fort sol- 
diers had noticed came an old sabre, a worn and faded 
uniform of the French grenadiers, a little dried sprig, 
its two withered leaves tied in their places with 
thread, and a coarse woodcut of the great Napoleon ; for 
Jacques was a soldier of the Empire. The uniform 
hung on the wall, carefully arranged on pegs as a man 
would wear it, and the sabre was brandished from the 
empty sleeve as though a hand held it ; the woodcut 
framed in green, renewed from day to day, pine in the 
winter, maple in the summer, occupied the opposite 
side, and under it was fastened the tiny withered sprig, 
while on the floor below was a fragment of buffalo-skin 
which served the soldier for a stool when he knelt in 
prayer. And did he pray to Napoleon, you ask ? I 
hardly know. He had a few of the Church's prayers 
by heart, but his mind was full of the Emperor as he 
repeated them, and his eyes were fixed upon the pic- 



 

ture as though it was the face of a saint. Discovering 
this, I labored hard to bring him to a clearer under- 
standing of the faith ; but all in vain. He listened to 
me patiently, even reverently, although I was much 
the younger ; at intervals he replied, ' Oui, mon pere,' 
and the next day he said his prayers to the dead Em- 
peror as usuaL And this was not the worst ; in place 
of an amen, there came a fierce imprecation against 
the whole English nation. After some months I suc- 
ceeded in persuading him to abandon this termination ; 
but I always suspected that it was but a verbal aban- 
donment, and that, mentally, the curse was as strong 
as ever. 

" Jacques had been a soldier of the Empire, as it is 
called, a grenadier under Napoleon ; he had loved 
his General and Emperor in life, and adored him in 
death with the affectionate pertinacity of a faithful 
dog. One hot day during the German campaign, Na- 
poleon, engaged in conference with some of his gen-
