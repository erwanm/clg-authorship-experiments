earth, and organizing its forces for the destruction of human souls,
while the churches are too busy enlarging their phylacteries and making
broader and more attractive the hems of their garments to take note of
this fatal vantage-ground acquired by the enemy.”

Mr. Dinneford stood and looked around him in a dazed sort of way.

“Is Grubb’s court near this?” he asked, recollecting the errand upon
which he had come.

“Yes.”

“A young lady called to see you yesterday afternoon to ask about a child
in that court?”

“Oh yes! You know the lady?”

“She is my daughter. One of the poor children in her sewing-class
told her of a neglected baby in Grubb’s court, and so drew upon her
sympathies that she started to go there, but was warned by the child
that it would be dangerous for a young lady like her to be seen in that
den of thieves and harlots, and so she came to you. And now I am here in
her stead to get your report about the baby. I would not consent to her
visiting this place again.”

Mr. Paulding took his visitor into the mission-house, near which they
were standing. After they were seated, he said,

“I have seen the baby about which your daughter wished me to make
inquiry. The woman who has the care of it is a vile creature, well known
in this region--drunken and vicious. She said at first that it was her
own baby, but afterward admitted that she didn’t know who its mother
was, and that she was paid for taking care of it. I found out, after
a good deal of talking round, and an interview with the mother of the
child who is in your daughter’s sewing-class, that a girl of notoriously
bad character, named Pinky Swett, pays the baby’s board. There’s a
mystery about the child, and I am of the opinion that it has been
stolen, or is known to be the offcast of some respectable family. The
woman who has the care of it was suspicious, and seemed annoyed at my
questions.”

“Is it a boy?” asked Mr. Dinneford.

“Yes, and has a finely-formed head and a pair of large, clear, hazel
eyes. Evidently it is of good parentage. The vicious, the sensual and
the depraved mark their offspring with the unmistakable signs of their
moral depravity. You cannot mistake them. But this baby has in its
poor, wasted, suffering little face, in its well-balanced head and deep,
almost spiritual eyes, the signs of a better origin.”

“It ought at once to be taken away from the woman,” said Mr. Dinneford,
in a very decided manner.

“Who is to take it?” asked the missionary.

Mr. Dinneford was silent.

“Neither you nor I have any authority to do so. If I were to see it cast
out upon the street, I might have it sent to the almshouse; but until I
find it abandoned or shamefully abused, I have no right to interfere.”

“I would like to see the baby,” said Mr. Dinneford, on whose mind
painful suggestions akin to those that were so disturbing his daughter
were beginning to intrude themselves.

“It would hardly be prudent to go there to-day,” said Mr. Paulding.

“Why not?”

“It would arouse suspicion; and if there is anything wrong, the baby
would drop out of sight. You would not find it if you went again. These
people are like birds with their wings half lifted, and fly away at the
first warning of danger. As it is, I fear my visit and inquiries will be
quite sufficient to the cause the child’s removal to another place.”

Mr. Dinneford mused for a while:

“There ought to be some way to reach a case like this, and there is,
I am sure. From what you say, it is more than probable that this poor
little waif may have drifted out of some pleasant home, where love would
bless it with the tenderest care, into this hell of neglect and cruelty.
It should be rescued on the instant. It is my duty--it is yours--to see
that it is done, and that without delay. I will go at once to the mayor
and state the case. He will send an officer with me, I know, and we will
take the child by force. If its real mother then comes forward and shows
herself at all worthy to have the care of it, well; if not, I will see
that it is taken care of. I know where to place it.”

To this proposition Mr. Paulding had no objection to offer.

“If you take that course, and act promptly, you can no doubt get
possession of the poor thing. Indeed, sir”--and the missionary spoke
with much earnestness--“if men of influence like yourself would come
here and look the evil of suffering and neglected children in the face,
and then do what they could to destroy that evil, there would soon be
joy in heaven over the good work accomplished by their hands. I could
give you a list of ten or twenty influential citizens whose will would
be next to law in a matter like this who could in a month, if they put
heart and hand to it, do such a work for humanity here as would make the
angels glad. But they are too busy with their great enterprises to give
thought and effort to a work like this.”

A shadow fell across the missionary’s face. There was a tone of
discouragement in his voice.

“The great question is what to do,” said Mr. Dinneford. “There are no
problems so hard to solve as these problems of social evil. If men and
women choose to debase themselves, who is to hinder? The vicious heart
seeks a vicious life. While the heart is depraved the life will be evil.
So long as the fountain is corrupt the water will be foul.”

“There is a side to all this that most people do not consider,” answered
Mr. Paulding. “Self-hurt is one thing, hurt of the neighbor quite
another. It may be questioned whether society has a right to touch the
individual freedom of a member in anything that affects himself alone.
But the moment he begins to hurt his neighbor, whether from ill-will
or for gain, then it is the duty of society to restrain him. The common
weal demands this, to say nothing of Christian obligation. If a man were
to set up an exhibition in our city dangerous to life and limb, but
so fascinating as to attract large numbers to witness and participate
therein, and if hundreds were maimed or killed every year, do you think
any one would question the right of our authorities to repress it? And
yet to-day there are in our city more than twenty thousand persons who
live by doing things a thousand times more hurtful to the people than
any such exhibition could possibly be. And what is marvelous to think
of, the larger part of these persons are actually licensed by the State
to get gain by hurting, depraving and destroying the people. Think of
it, Mr. Dinneford! The whole question lies in a nutshell. There is
no difficulty about the problem. Restrain men from doing harm to each
other, and the work is more than half done.”

“Is not the law all the while doing this?”

“The law,” was answered, “is weakly dealing with effect--how weakly let
prison and police statistics show. Forty thousand arrests in our city
for a single year, and the cause of these arrests clearly traced to the
liquor licenses granted to five or six thousand persons to make money
by debasing and degrading the people. If all of these were engaged in
useful employments, serving, as every true citizen is bound to do, the
common good, do you think we should have so sad and sickening a record?
No, sir! We must go back to the causes of things. Nothing but radical
work will do.”

“You think, then,” said Mr. Dinneford, “that the true remedy for all
these dreadful social evils lies in restrictive legislation?”

“Restrictive only on the principles of eternal right,” answered the
missionary. “Man’s freedom over himself must not be touched. Only his
freedom to hurt his neighbor must be abridged. Here society has a right
to put bonds on its members--to say to each individual, You are free to
do anything by which your neighbor is served, but nothing to harm him.
Here is where the discrimination must be made; and when the mass of the
people come to see this, we shall have the beginning of a new day. There
will then be hope for such poor wretches as crowd this region; or if
most of them are so far lost as to be without hope, their places,
when they die, will not be filled with new recruits for the army of
perdition.”

“If the laws we now have were only executed,” said Mr. Dinneford,
“there might be hope in our legislative restrictions. But the people
are defrauded of justice through defects in its machinery. There are
combinations to defeat good laws. There are men holding high office
notoriously in league with scoundrels who prey upon the people. Through
these, justice perpetually fails.”

“The people are alone to blame,” replied the missionary. “Each is busy
with his farm and his merchandise with his own affairs, regardless
of his neighbor. The common good is nothing, so that his own good is
served. Each weakly folds his hands and is sorry when these troublesome
questions are brought to his notice, but doesn’t see that he can do
anything. Nor can the people, unless some strong and influential leaders
rally them, and, like great generals, lead them to the battle. As I said
a little while ago, there are ten or twenty men in this city who, if
they could be made to feel their high responsibility--who, if they could
be induced to look away for a brief period from their great enterprises
and concentrate thought and effort upon these questions of social
evil, abuse of justice and violations of law--would in a single month
inaugurate reforms and set agencies to work that would soon produce
marvelous changes. They need not touch the rottenness of this half-dead
carcass with knife or poultice. Only let them cut off the sources
of pollution and disease, and the purified air will do the work of
restoration where moral vitality remains, or hasten the end in those who
are debased beyond hope.”

“What could these men do? Where would their work begin?” asked Mr.
Dinneford.

“Their own intelligence would soon discover the way to do this work if
their hearts were in it. Men who can organize and successfully conduct
great financial and industrial enterprises, who know how to control
the wealth and power of the country and lead the people almost at will,
would hardly be at fault in the adjustment of a matter like this.
What would be the money influence of ‘whisky rings’ and gambling
associations, set against the social and money influence of these
men? Nothing, sir, nothing! Do you think we should long have over six
thousand bars and nearly four hundred lottery-policy shops in our city
if the men to whom I refer were to take the matter in hand?”

“Are there so many policy-shops?” asked Mr. Dinneford, in surprise.

“There may be more. You will find them by scores in every locality
where poor and ignorant people are crowded together, sucking out
their substance, and in the neighborhood of all the market-houses and
manufactories, gathering in spoil. The harm they are doing is beyond
computation. The men who control this unlawful business are rich and
closely organized. They gather in their dishonest gains at the rate of
hundreds of thousands of dollars every year, and know how and where
to use this money for the protection of their agents in the work of
defrauding the people, and the people are helpless because our men
of wealth and influence have no time to give to public justice or the
suppression of great social wrongs. With them, as things now are, rests
the chief responsibility. They have the intelligence, the wealth and
the public confidence, and are fully equal to the task if they will put
their hands to the work. Let them but lift the standard and sound the
trumpet of reform, and the people will rally instantly at the call.
It must not be a mere spasmodic effort--a public meeting with wordy
resolutions and strong speeches only--but organized work based on true
principles of social order and the just rights of the people.”

“You are very much in earnest about this matter,” said Mr. Dinneford,
seeing how excited the missionary had grown.

“And so would you and every other good citizen become if, standing
face to face, as I do daily, with this awful debasement and crime and
suffering, you were able to comprehend something of its real character.
If I could get the influential citizens to whom I have referred to come
here and see for themselves, to look upon this pandemonium in their
midst and take in an adequate idea of its character, significance and
aggressive force, there would be some hope of making them see their
duty, of arousing them to action. But they stand aloof, busy with
personal and material interest, while thousands of men, women and
children are yearly destroyed, soul and body, through their indifference
to duty and ignorance of their fellows’ suffering.”

“It is easy to say such things,” answered Mr. Dinneford, who felt the
remarks of Mr. Paulding as almost personal.

“Yes, it is easy to say them,” returned the missionary, his voice
dropping to a lower key, “and it may be of little use to say them. I am
sometimes almost in despair, standing so nearly alone as I do with my
feet on the very brink of this devastating flood of evil, and getting
back only faint echoes to my calls for help. But when year after year
I see some sheaves coming in as the reward of my efforts and of the few
noble hearts that work with me, I thank God and take courage, and I lift
my voice and call more loudly for help, trusting that I may be heard by
some who, if they would only come up to the help of the Lord against the
mighty, would scatter his foes like chaff on the threshing-floor. But
I am holding you back from your purpose to visit the mayor; I think
you had better act promptly if you would get possession of the child.
I shall be interested in the result, and will take it as a favor if you
will call at the mission again.”




CHAPTER XV.



WHEN Mr. Dinneford and the policeman sent by the mayor at his
solicitation visited Grubb’s court, the baby was not to be found. The
room in which it had been seen by Mr. Paulding was vacant. Such a room
as it was!--low and narrow, with bare, blackened walls, the single
window having scarcely two whole panes of glass, the air loaded with the
foulness that exhaled from the filth-covered floor, the only furniture a
rough box and a dirty old straw bed lying in a corner.

As Mr. Dinneford stood at the door of this room and inhaled its fetid
air, he grew sick, almost faint. Stepping back, with a shocked and
disgusted look on his face, he said to the policeman,

“There must be a mistake. This cannot be the room.”

Two or three children and a coarse, half-clothed woman, seeing a
gentleman going into the house accompanied by a policeman, had followed
them closely up stairs.

“Who lives in this room?” asked the policeman, addressing the woman.

“Don’t know as anybody lives there now,” she replied, with evident
evasion.

“Who did live here?” demanded the policeman.

“Oh, lots!” returned the woman, curtly.

“I want to know who lived here last,” said the policeman, a little
sternly.

“Can’t say--never keep the run of ‘em,” answered the woman, with more
indifference than she felt. “Goin’ and comin’ all the while. Maybe it
was Poll Davis.”

“Had she a baby?”

The woman gave a vulgar laugh as she replied: “I rather think not.”

“It was Moll Fling,” said one of the children, “and she had a baby.”

“When was she here last?” inquired the policeman.

The woman, unseen by the latter, raised her fist and threatened the
child, who did not seem to be in the least afraid of her, for she
answered promptly:

“She went away about an hour ago.”

“And took the baby?”

“Yes. You see Mr. Paulding was here asking about the baby, and she got
scared.”

“Why should that scare her?”

“I don’t know, only it isn’t her baby.”

“How do you know that?”

“‘Cause it isn’t--I know it isn’t. She’s paid to take care of it.”

“Who by?”

“Pinky Swett.”

“Who’s Pinky Swett?”

“Don’t you know Pinky Swett?” and the child seemed half surprised.

“Where does Pinky Swett live?” asked the policeman.

“She did live next door for a while, but I don’t know where she’s gone.”

Nothing beyond this could be ascertained. But having learned the names
of the women who had possession of the child, the policeman said there
would be no difficulty about discovering them. It might take a little
time, but they could not escape the vigilance of the police.

With this assurance, Mr. Dinneford hastened from the polluted air of
Grubb’s court, and made his way to the mission in Briar street, in order
to have some further conference with Mr. Paulding.

“As I feared,” said the missionary, on learning that the baby could not
be found. “These creatures are as keen of scent as Indians, and know
the smallest sign of danger. It is very plain that there is something
wrong--that these women have no natural right to the child, and that
they are not using it to beg with.”

“Do you know a woman called Pinky Swett?” asked the policeman.

“I’ve heard of her, but do not know her by sight. She bears a hard
reputation even here, and adds to her many evil accomplishments the
special one of adroit robbery. A victim lured to her den rarely escapes
without loss of watch or pocket-book. And not one in a hundred dares to
give information, for this would expose him to the public, and so her
crimes are covered. Pinky Swett is not the one to bother herself about
a baby unless its parentage be known, and not then unless the knowledge
can be turned to advantage.”

“The first thing to be done, then, is to find this woman,” said the
policeman.

“That will not be very hard work. But finding the baby, if she thinks
you are after it, would not be so easy,” returned Mr. Paulding. “She’s
as cunning as a fox.”

“We shall see. If the chief of police undertakes to find the baby, it
won’t be out of sight long. You’d better confer with the mayor again,”
 added the policeman, addressing Mr. Dinneford.

“I will do so without delay,” returned that gentleman.

“I hope to see you here again soon,” said the missionary as Mr.
Dinneford was about going. “If I can help you in any way, I shall do so
gladly.”

“I have no doubt but that you can render good service.” Then, in half
apology, and to conceal the real concern at his heart, Mr. Dinneford
added, “Somehow, and strangely enough when I come to think of it, I have
allowed myself to get drawn into this thing, and once in, the natural
persistence of my character leads me to go on to the end. I am one of
those who cannot bear to give up or acknowledge a defeat; and so, having
set my hand to this work, I am going to see it through.”

When the little girl who had taken Edith to the mission-house in Briar
street got home and told her story, there was a ripple of excitement in
that part of Grubb’s court where she lived, and a new interest was felt
in the poor neglected baby. Mr. Paulding’s visit and inquiries added to
this interest. It had been several days since Pinky Swett’s last visit
to the child to see that it was safe. On the morning after Edith’s call
at the mission she came in about ten o’clock, and heard the news. In
less than twenty minutes the child and the woman who had charge of it
both disappeared from Grubb’s court. Pinky sent them to her own room,
not many squares distant, and then drew from the little girl who was in
Edith’s sewing-class all she knew about that young lady. It was not much
that the child could tell. She was very sweet and good and handsome, and
wore such beautiful clothes, was so kind and patient with the girls, but
she did not remember her name, thought it was Edith.

“Now, see here,” said Pinky, and she put some money into the child’s
hand; “I want you to find out for me what her name is and where she
lives. Mind, you must be very careful to remember.”

“What do you want to know for?” asked the little girl.

“That’s none of your business. Do what I tell you,” returned Pinky, with
impatience; “and if you do it right, I’ll give you a quarter more. When
do you go again?”

“Next week, on Thursday.”

“Not till next Thursday!” exclaimed Pinky, in a tone of disappointment.

“The school’s only once a week.”

Pinky chafed a good deal, but it was of no use; she must wait.

“You’ll be sure and go next Thursday?” she said.

“If Mother lets me,” replied the child.

“Oh, I’ll see to that; I’ll make her let you. What time does the school
go in?”

“At three o’clock.”

“Very well. You wait for me. I’ll come round here at half-past two, and
go with you. I want to see the young lady. They’ll let me come into the
school and learn to sew, won’t they?”

“I don’t know; you’re too big, and you don’t want to learn.”

“How do you know I don’t?”

“Because I do.”

Pinky laughed, and then said,

“You’ll wait for me?”

“Yes, if mother says so.”

“All right;” and Pinky hurried away to take measures for hiding the baby
from a search that she felt almost sure was about being made. The first
thing she did was to soundly abuse the woman in whose care she had
placed the hapless child for her neglect and ill treatment, both of
which were too manifest, and then to send her away under the new aspect
of affairs she did not mean to trust this woman, nor indeed to trust
anybody who knew anything of the inquiries which had been made about the
child. A new nurse must be found, and she must live as far away from the
old locality as possible. Pinky was not one inclined to put things off.
Thought and act were always close together. Scarcely had the woman been
gone ten minutes, before, bundling the baby in a shawl, she started off
to find a safer hiding-place. This time she was more careful about the
character and habits of the person selected for a nurse, and the baby’s
condition was greatly improved. The woman in whose charge she placed it
was poor, but neither drunken nor depraved. Pinky arranged with her to
take the care of it for two dollars a week, and supplied it with clean
and comfortable clothing. Even she, wicked and vile as she was, could
not help being touched by the change that appeared in the baby’s
shrunken face, and in its sad but beautiful eyes, after its wasted
little body had been cleansed and clothed in clean, warm garments and it
had taken its fill of nourishing food.

“It’s a shame, the way it has been abused,” said Pinky, speaking from an
impulse of kindness, such as rarely swelled in her evil heart.

“A crying shame,” answered the woman as she drew the baby close against
her bosom and gazed down upon its pitiful face, and into the large brown
eyes that were lifted to hers in mute appeal.

The real motherly tenderness that was in this woman’s heart was quickly
perceived by the child, who did not move its eyes from hers, but lay
perfectly still, gazing up at her in a kind of easeful rest such as it
had never before known. She spoke to it in loving tones, touched its
thin cheeks with her finger in playful caresses, kissed it on its lips
and forehead, hugged it to her bosom; and still the eyes were fixed on
hers in a strange baby-wonder, though not the faintest glinting of a
smile played on its lips or over its serious face. Had it never learned
to smile?

At last the poor thin lips curved a little, crushing out the lines of
suffering, and into the eyes there came a loving glance in place of the
fixed, wondering look that was almost a stare. A slight lifting of the
hands, a motion of the head, a thrill through the whole body came next,
and then a tender cooing sound.

“Did you ever see such beautiful eyes?” said the woman. “It will be a
splendid baby when it has picked up a little.”

“Let it pick up as fast as it can,” returned Pinky; “but mind what I
say: you are to be mum. Here’s your pay for the first week, and you
shall have it fair and square always. Call it your own baby, if you
will, or your grandson. Yes, that’s better. He’s the child of your dead
daughter, just sent to you from somewhere out of town. So take good
care of him, and keep your mouth shut. I’ll be round again in a little
while.”

And with this injunction Pinky went away. On the next Thursday she
visited the St. John’s mission sewing-school in company with the little
girl from Grubb’s court, but greatly to her disappointment, Edith did
not make her appearance. There were four or five ladies in attendance
on the school, which, under the superintendence of one of them, a woman
past middle life, with a pale, serious face and a voice clear and sweet,
was conducted with an order and decorum not often maintained among a
class of children such as were there gathered together.

It was a long time since Pinky had found herself so repressed and ill
at ease. There was a spiritual atmosphere in the place that did not
vitalize her blood. She felt a sense of constriction and suffocation.
She had taken her seat in the class taught usually by Edith, with the
intention of studying that young lady and finding out all she could
about her, not doubting her ability to act the part in hand with perfect
self-possession. But she had not been in the room a minute before
confidence began to die, and very soon she found herself ill at ease and
conscious of being out of her place. The bold, bad woman felt weak and
abashed. An unseen sphere of purity and Christian love surrounded and
touched her soul with as palpable an impression as outward things give
to the body. She had something of the inward distress and pain a devil
would feel if lifted into the pure air of heaven, and the same desire
to escape and plunge back into the dense and impure atmosphere in
which evil finds its life and enjoyment. If she had come with any good
purpose, it would have been different, but evil, and only evil, was in
her heart; and when this felt the sphere of love and purity, her breast
was constricted and life seemed going out of her.

It was little less than torture to Pinky for the short time she
remained. As soon as she was satisfied that Edith would not be there,
she threw down the garment on which she had been pretending to sew, and
almost ran from the room.

“Who is that girl?” asked the lady who was teaching the class, looking
in some surprise after the hurrying figure.

“It’s Pinky Swett,” answered the child from Grubb’s court. “She wanted
to see our teacher.”

“Who is your regular teacher?” was inquired.

“Don’t remember her name.”

“It’s Edith,” spoke up one of the girls. “Mrs. Martin called her that.”

“What did this Pinky Swett want to see her about?”

“Don’t know,” answered the child as she remembered the money Pinky had
given her and the promise of more.

The teacher questioned no further, but went on with her work in the
class.




CHAPTER XVI.



IT was past midday when Mr. Dinneford returned home after his
fruitless search. Edith, who had been waiting for hours in restless
suspense, heard his step in the hall, and ran down to meet him.

“Did you see the baby?”’ she asked, trying to keep her agitation down.

Mr. Dinneford only shook his head,

“Why, not, father?” Her voice choked.

“It could not be found.”

“You saw Mr. Paulding?”

“Yes.”

“Didn’t he find the baby?”

“Oh yes. But when I went to Grubb’s court this morning, it was not
there, and no one could or would give any information about it. As the
missionary feared, those having possession of the baby had taken alarm
and removed it to another place. But I have seen the mayor and some of
the police, and got them interested. It will not be possible to hide the
child for any length of time.”

“You said that Mr. Paulding saw it?”

“Yes.”

“What did he say?” Edith’s voice trembled as she asked the question.

“He thinks there is something wrong.”

“Did he tell you how the baby looked?”

“He said that it had large, beautiful brown eyes.”

Edith clasped her hands, and drew them tightly against her bosom.

“Oh, father! if it should be my baby!”

“My dear, dear child,” said Mr. Dinneford, putting his arms about Edith
and holding her tightly, “you torture yourself with a wild dream. The
thing is impossible.”

“It is somebody’s baby,” sobbed Edith, her face on her father’s breast,
“and it may be mine. Who knows?”

“We will do our best to find it,” returned Mr. Dinneford, “and then do
what Christian charity demands. I am in earnest so far, and will leave
nothing undone, you may rest assured. The police have the mayor’s
instructions to find the baby and give it into my care, and I do not
think we shall have long to wait.”

An ear they thought not of, heard all this. Mrs. Dinneford’s suspicions
had been aroused by many things in Edith’s manner and conduct of late,
and she had watched her every look and word and movement with a keenness
of observation that let nothing escape. Careful as her husband and
daughter were in their interviews, it was impossible to conceal anything
from eyes that never failed in watchfulness. An unguarded word here, a
look of mutual intelligence there, a sudden silence when she appeared,
an unusual soberness of demeanor and evident absorbed interest in
something they were careful to conceal, had the effect to quicken all
Mrs. Dinneford’s alarms and suspicions.

She had seen from the top of the stairs a brief but excited interview
pass between Edith and her father as the latter stood in the vestibule
that morning, and she had noticed the almost wild look on her daughter’s
face as she hastened back along the hall and ran up to her room. Here
she stayed alone for over an hour, and then came down to the parlor,
where she remained restless, moving about or standing by the window for
a greater part of the morning.

There was something more than usual on hand. Guilt in its guesses came
near the truth. What could all this mean, if it had not something to
do with the cast-off baby? Certainty at last came. She was in the
dining-room when Edith ran down to meet her father in the hall, and
slipped noiselessly and unobserved into one of the parlors, where,
concealed by a curtain, she heard everything that passed between her
husband and daughter.

Still as death she stood, holding down the strong pulses of her heart.
From the hall Edith and her father turned into one of the parlors--the
same in which Mrs. Dinneford was concealed behind the curtain--and sat
down.

“It had large brown eyes?” said Edith, a yearning tenderness in her
voice.

“Yes, and a finely-formed bead, showing good parentage,” returned the
father.

“Didn’t you find out who the women were--the two bad women the little
girl told me about? If we had their names, the police could find them.
The little girl’s mother must know who they are.”

“We have the name of one of them,” said Mr. Dinneford. “She is called
Pinky Swett, and it can’t be long before the police are on her track.
She is said to be a desperate character. Nothing more can be done now;
we must wait until the police work up the affair. I will call at the
mayor’s office in the morning and find out what has been done.”

Mrs. Dinneford heard no more. The bell rang, and her husband and
daughter left the parlor and went up stairs. The moment they were beyond
observation she glided noiselessly through the hall, and reached her
chamber without being noticed. Soon afterward she came down dressed for
visiting, and went out hastily, her veil closely drawn. Her manner was
hurried. Descending the steps, she stood for a single moment, as if
hesitating which way to go, and then moved off rapidly. Soon she had
passed out of the fashionable neighborhood in which she lived. After
this she walked more slowly, and with the air of one whose mind was
in doubt or hesitation. Once she stopped, and turning about, slowly
retraced her steps for the distance of a square. Then she wheeled
around, as if from some new and strong resolve, and went on again. At
last she paused before a respectable-looking house of moderate size in a
neighborhood remote from the busier and more thronged parts of the city.
The shutters were all bowed down to the parlor, and the house had a
quiet, unobtrusive look. Mrs. Dinneford gave a quick, anxious glance up
and down the street, and then hurriedly ascended the steps and rang the
bell.

“Is Mrs. Hoyt in?” she asked of a stupid-looking girl who came to the
door.

“Yes, ma’am,” was answered.

“Tell her a lady wants to see her;” and she passed into the
plainly-furnished parlor. There were no pictures on the walls nor
ornaments on the mantel-piece, nor any evidence of taste--nothing
home-like--in the shadowed room, the atmosphere of which was close and
heavy. She waited here for a few moments, when there was a rustle of
garments and the sound of light, quick feet on the stairs. A small,
dark-eyed, sallow-faced woman entered the parlor.

“Mrs. Bray--no, Mrs. Hoyt.”

“Mrs. Dinneford;” and the two women stood face to face for a few
moments, each regarding the other keenly.

“Mrs. Hoyt--don’t forget,” said the former, with a warning emphasis in
her voice. “Mrs. Bray is dead.”

In her heart Mrs. Dinneford wished that it were indeed so.

“Anything wrong?” asked the black-eyed little woman.

“Do you know a Pinky Swett?” asked Mrs. Dinneford, abruptly.

Mrs. Hoyt--so we must now call her--betrayed surprise at this
question, and was about answering “No,” but checked herself and gave a
half-hesitating “Yes,” adding the question, “What about her?”

Before Mrs. Dinneford could reply, however, Mrs. Hoyt took hold of her
arm and said, “Come up to my room. Walls have ears sometimes, and I will
not answer for these.”

Mrs. Dinneford went with her up stairs to a chamber in the rear part of
the building.

“We shall be out of earshot here,” said Mrs. Hoyt as she closed the
door, locking it at the same time. “And now tell me what’s up, and what
about Pinky Swett.”

“You know her?”

“Yes, slightly.”

“More than slightly, I guess.”

Mrs. Hoyt’s eyes flashed impatiently. Mrs. Dinneford saw it, and took
warning.

“She’s got that cursed baby.”

“How do you know?”

“No matter how I know. It’s enough that I know. Who is she?”

“That question may be hard to answer. About all I know of her is that
she came from the country a few years ago, and has been drifting about
here ever since.”

“What is she doing with that baby? and how did she get hold of it?”

“Questions more easily asked than answered.”

“Pshaw! I don’t want any beating about the bush, Mrs. Bray.”

“Mrs. Hoyt,” said the person addressed.

“Oh, well, Mrs. Hoyt, then. We ought to understand each other by this
time.”

“I guess we do;” and the little woman arched her brows.

“I don’t want any beating about the bush,” resumed Mrs. Dinneford. “I am
here on business.”

“Very well; let’s to business, then;” and Mrs. Hoyt leaned back in her
chair.

“Edith knows that this woman has the baby,” said Mrs. Dinneford.

“What!” and Mrs. Hoyt started to her feet.

“The mayor has been seen, and the police are after her.”

“How do you know?”

“Enough that I know. And now, Mrs. Hoyt, this thing must come to an
end, and there is not an instant to be lost. Has Pinky Swett, as she is
called, been told where the baby came from?”

“Not by me.”

“By anybody?”

“That is more than I can say.”

“What has become of the woman I gave it to?”

“She’s about somewhere.”

“When did you see her?”

Mrs. Hoyt pretended to think for some moments, and then replied:

“Not for a month or two.”

“Had she the baby then?”

“No; she was rid of it long before that.”

“Did she know this Pinky Swett?”

“Yes.”

“Curse the brat! If I’d thought all this trouble was to come, I’d have
smothered it before it was half an hour old.”

“Risky business,” remarked Mrs. Hoyt.

“Safer than to have let it live,” said Mrs. Dinneford, a hard, evil
