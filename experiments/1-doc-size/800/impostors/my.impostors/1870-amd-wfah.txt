"We find that Eustace Gilliat came to his death, on the 
night of September tenth, by a wound from a pistol, discharged 
at the hands of Victor Hurst." 

" M?.ke out the necessary papers. The man must be com 
mitted for trial." 




Then the solemnity was broken by stir and shuffle and the 
hum of voices. Trewartha came to Sylvia and pressed her cold, 
ungloved fingers. Although she swayed like a lily on its stem, 
and her face was of lily whiteness, something in her eyes told 
that the agony was too tense to allow of fainting. 

"Oh !" with a low, wild cry that went hardly farther than 
his ears, "I am the cause of it all ! There is nothing in my 
life that could make amends for his, and the bitter shame, the 
suffering, the pangs of his mother " 

" Hush, child. Do not make your burden heavier by fierce 
upbraidings. There is a strange mystery about it all. I think 
it must come right, but I don't know hpw." 

" He is innocent!" with a feverish, passionate. force. "If I 
could see him and tell him so." 

' ' You can. Will it not be too much ?" after a moment's 
pause, noting the strained hard lines about the mouth. 

"No, no ;" wringing her hands wearily. 

The conclave broke up. It was so clear to all their minds 
that the final verdict was a foregone conclusion. 

The prisoner would be taken to Taunton jail. "No," in 
answer to a question of Trewartha's, "there could be no pres 
ent arrangement made concerning bail ; and in a criminal case 
like this where it was the life of a fellow-creature " 

"Will you see him?" asked Milnor, a faint curiosity 
stirring his own languid nerves. 

"See him?" and Kirke Gilliat turned with an expression 
of disgust on his handsome, worldly face. "No, I have no 
morbid desire to gaze at a low, vile criminal, whose hands are 
stained with blood and the blood that of my own child. 
Let us get out of this crowd. The very air stifles me." 

He could not even go over there and speak to Sylvia Red 
mond. She, too, had sunk in his estimation, since it was 
plain her bias was in favor of the prisoner a coarse, restless, 
turbulent fellow, who was beginning early in youth a shameful 
career. What did it matter if he went to the hangman ? 




 

The evil deeds of his own son were forgotten. Why, his 
sensual, wine-flavored, self-indulgent life, his gaming and sins 
looked clean, of course, beside the crime of this one, come 
up from the air of shops and trade-riots. 

They picked their way out. Sylvia shivered, glad that he had 
not spoken, yet cut to the quick by the open neglect. The 
crowd still lingered, watching the elegant Gilliat carriage roll 
away, and then waiting for the other to be started on his journey. 

After awhile the three went up-stairs. Victor was strangely 
calm, and helped them all to keep their self-possession. 

"It will only be for a few days," said Trewartha. "If 
Cragness and the Cedars are not enough, we will put the whole 
county under bonds." 

Victor took Sylvia's hands. At first she could not speak ; 
but he read the face slowly. So changed, so full of pain and 
heroic tenderness, and sublimed by a faith that thrilled him 
to the heart's core. 

"I am clean in your eyes?" he whispered, the voice hoarse 
and tremulous, though scarcely above a breath. 

For answer she bowed a little, letting her veil fall, and un 
der cover of it, she pressed her lips to the hand that held hers. 
He knew then the secret of her soul. What did it matter to 
her ? Was there any shame in the truth, the noble integrity 
that she was henceforth to make her standard ? 

Trewartha insisted that they should leave him there. He 
did not want them to remember the other picture the lad 
they loved going off to a felon's cell with a constable by his 
side. 

Anah Hurst sat by the window, waiting. John had been 
very drowsy all day, and was now asleep. Seeing them come, 
she went down the path. 

"Oh!" with a wild, despairing cry, reading the secret in 
their pained faces. 

Janet McRae took her in in her strong arms, towering 
above her like a man. 



 

" Anah Hurst, the hand of God is laid heavily upon us. If 
He ever heard prayer or cry of yours, pray to Him now. As 
for me well, I think I've been my own God. All my life I 
have glorified my own works. ' I have pulled down and builded 
up, measured the souls of men and women, and meted out 
my own justice or beneficence. I thought to do so with him. 
Don't curse me in your mother's grief. I meant to make him 
rich and honored, and give him a high station for my own 
pleasure. This is the work of my hands, the punishment of 
my pride. Friends, pray for me as well as him. " 

They never forgot that tone of strong agony and bitter hu 
miliation. 

"No, no !" Anah Hurst said, wanderingly. 

" You and John have the right secret of life, maybe. Chil 
dren, I am an old, old woman. Be merciful." And with that 
she sank down on the door-step, while her vigorous frame 
shook as if palsied. 

Anah Hurst kissed the cold lips, and then said, in a strong, 
calm voice 

"I too, have a duty. I believe God has transformed my 
heaviest cross into the means of saving my son. I must see 
Kirke Gilliat this very night, before I sleep. Will you take 
me to St. Albans, Doctor Trewartha ?" 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

SYLVIA decided to go to St. Albans also. James Redmond's 
body was lying at the house of Rachel Braisted, still unburied, 
and she must learn her mother's wishes upon the subject. 
Although she felt wretchedly weak she nerved both soul and 
body for the task. 

Long before they reached their journey's end, the night set 
in, gloomy and starless. They wound round the ghostly hills, 
the two women clasping hands tightly under cover of their 
shawls, drawing so near to each other, yet neither knowing 
what was in the other's heart, only the chain of broad, com 
mon suffering. 

Trewartha handed them out at length. Sylvia led her com 
panion up the broad hotel steps, through the wide hall to a 
reception-room, and sent a message to Mr. Gilliat. 

Mr. Milnor answered the summons. 

" My friend is so utterly worn out and exhausted that he 
can see no one this evening. I might possibly attend to your 
business, if it is urgent." 

" No," she answered, quietly. " I must see him." Then, 
drawing a folded paper from her reticule, she continued 
" Will you please hand him this ?" 

She had sent her own name first. It gave her woman's 
heart a bitter pang to know he had cared so little that he had 
never taken the trouble to inquire what her destiny might be, 
and as Mrs. Hurst, in his sight, she was simply the mother of a 
criminal. 

Kirke Gilliat opened the paper with an impatient frown. 
" Has the woman no delicacy?" he flung out angrily. " Yet 
what could one expect ?" 



 

" Anah McRae Hurst. Northfield, 18 " 

He staggered with the suddenness of the blow, and dashed 
his clinched hand against his forehead. 

"Milnor !" glancing wildly around "stay I Must see 
her where we cannot be interrupted. Will you allow me the 
use of your room ?" 

For it would never do to talk to Anah McRae with only 
a door between her voice and his wife. Mrs. McRae of Crag- 
ness. He saw it all now. If he had known of the connection 
before ! 

After giving Milnor time to escort her thither, he walked 
slowly up the stairs, a horrible thought of retribution entering 
his mind. Had the old warning been interpreted as a curse 
in his case ? "The sins of the fathers " 

She was standing in the middle of the dimly-lighted room, 
a pale, plainly-dressed gentlewoman, not to -be compared to 
Beatrice Gilliat, her senior by some years. But the chances 
of life had been so different. Toil and poverty had left their 
signet, coming out plainer now that she was weary and suffering. 
The man's fastidious sense took it all in, judging without 
understanding the hidden causes. 

"My God !" he said ; "I never guessed that you were his 
mother !" 



" Yes ;" steadying her voice. "I have borne my pain alone 
these many years, and I have come to lay a part of it on your 
shoulders. It is your son, Kirke Gilliat, who is to sleep in a 
felon's cell to-night." 

"Oh, Anah !" with a wild cry of anguish as the truth was 
thus certified. " A brother's hand raised against brother !" 

"Yes, it was that, though Victor is innocent. It was the 
son of the free woman against the son of the bond woman ;'' 
with a shrill, hysterical laugh. 

"No, it cannot be," he said. "You mock me." \ 

For, with all that sharp, clear evidence before him, he could 
see the guilt of Victor Hurst, and it added to his pang; Awhile 



 

she, believing him innocent, had not the horrible certainty to 
drive her to despair. 

"You know nothing about him ;" in her earnest, decisive 
way, for now all the old hesitation had dropped off like a 
worn-out garment. " He has had his faults but he never told 
me, his mother, a deliberate lie in his life. If he had been 
guilty, he would have kept silence." 

" But you married ?" 

" I did. After the announcement of Kirke Gilliat's espousal 
of his cousin, I married a good, honorable man, who had 
secretly loved me a long while, and who offered me a name 
for myself, and my child. And yet it was hardly my own 
wish. Not that I had any doubt of my own right you had 
taken good care of that," smiling bitterly. "But to me that 
false marriage was a life-long sacred bond. Had I stood 
entirely alone in the world, I think I would have borne the 
shame. If I could have found a place for my child, where he 
would not have been crowded to the wall for another man's 
sin, I might still have braved the consequences. But the faces 
that smiled on you would have been shocked at sight of me. 
The falsehood and deception that they could forgive on the 
man's part, was whiteness compared to a simple act of trust on 
a woman's." 

He knew of a sin blacker than any of which she held him 
guilty. If he could make reparation here and now ; but that 
was madness. 

"My son!" he answered, hoarsely. "And this man 
whom you married " 

" I am not sure but that it was a crime. I could not see 
clearly in those days, when I was racked with anguish and 
despair ; but I knew well that he would watch over me, that my 
pain and shame would be his through his love ; that to see me 
disgraced in the world's estimation, thrust out to perish, would 
cause him more suffering than if he befriended me ; and I did 
my best to repay him. Perhaps I had no right thus to save 



 

myself, having once believed and loved my only crime. For 
I think even now that you will bear witness to some fears and 
hesitation on my part. I would fain have delayed the 
ceremony, used only to quiet my conscience, by a man who 
was integrity itself to his compeers, men of the world, who 
would have scorned a lie in any business transaction, but 
thought it no sin to deceive the woman who loved him, to 
betray her with the most sacred vow a man ever can give." 

"Have mercy," he cried, weakly, " have mercy ! If you 
could know all the the circumstances. " 

"The results I do know. My son defrauded of his just birth 
right, and now in a prison cell, accused of a monstrous crime ; 
and our lives with their nameless blight and pain." 

" God help me !" and he began to pace the room. "Tell 
me what to do. But how can I save him ?" 

She read the marks of anguish in the still handsome but 
worldly face, yet she understood now that all pangs were 
evanescent with this nature, in which there was some weak, 
fatal flaw. 

" God knows what I would give to go back now to the hour 
of our parting." 

Having lived through the past, and not found in it the com 
plete satisfaction that it had promised, he would fain have it 
different Was that repentance for his sin against her ? She 
felt and spurned the paltry concession. 

"We have nothing to do with the past, Mr. Gilliat," she 
returned, coldly. " You have a wife, and I a husband. Even 
if it were not so, you would see the difference between us too 
plainly. If I lacked culture, beauty, and elegance in the days 
of my youth, a hard, narrow life has only added to the wants." 

' ' No, it was not that, " vehemently. ' ' There was a kind 
of fate planned out for me from the first." 

" Did I ask for your love ? for this miserable mockery of 
marriage ?" 

She felt his cowardice and cruelty so keenly. A little truth 



 

in the beginning would have saved these terrible complications, 
and a hard wrench then would have proved more merciful 
than t,his life-long agony. 

He came back and seated himself at the table, leaning his 
chin upon his 'and. The light being in range, gave her his 
face distinctly. How much ease, indulgence, and self-love had 
gone into it with the years. She knew another that had taken 
some of its best points, but her misgiving for this young, 
vigorous life had strangely ended. For the past six months it 
had reached a truer comprehension of the honest, earnest 
purpose that saves souls from baser self-engrossment. 

"Tell me what to do." His voice was strained and hoarse, 

*and seemed to have in it something of womanish pain. 

"Every particle of testimony went against him. My son as 

well ! Good God ! this is a bitter retribution. If I could 

believe him innocent !" 

" If I could not have told you this truth I should not have 
come. You can at least refrain from persecuting him. You 
can give him the chance of any doubt that may arise. The 
rest must be left to a higher power God." 

He rose again and approached her. The face was pure 
and proud, and gave token of a higher spiritual life than his. 
He knew then how he was judged, and in spite of the old 
love, despised. 

" He shall not want for anything, and if I could change 
circumstances " 

' ' I only ask that his own father may not hurry him to final 
shame ;" and her voice was clearly cold. " He has friends 
money ; do not think I came for these." 

"You are the last of the McRaes, I believe." 

"Janet McRae is the last of her pure line ;" with an em 
phasis that stung him keenly. 

"But" 

" If you are thinking of Victor in connection with Mrs. 
McRae, I can tell you that he would never take his disgrace 


 

there. When my husband dies, my son and I will leave the 
places that have known us, and begin anew." 

"Then he is aware " and Kirke Gilliat's pale, tortured 
face flushed the deepest crimson. 

"Yes. I could not keep the horrible secret out of my eyes 
on that fatal morning ;" her voice sharpening unconsciously. 

He covered his eyes with his hands and was silent a long 
while. 

"God knows that I am glad to have him feel innocent. I 
cannot take it all in now, with the dead lying in yonder 
room, but you may trust us." 

"That is enough." 

She rose as if she would go. Why should he detain her ? 
What could he offer in extenuation of his deep and deadly 
sin? He felt as if a decade of years had swept over him. His 
limbs were feeble, his brain stunned, confused. 

"The sin is too great to be forgiven," he said, weakly. 

She knew what he meant, but she could not take his hand 
there. Her pangs had been too keen and bitter, besides, she 
realized more keenly than ever how she had loved this man, 
and how, in spite of all, the pain had lasted through weary- 
years. She wished him no ill, but she could not begin to wish 
him well just at this moment. 

"God is merciful." 

With that she turned away. He made no effort to detain 
her, for the consequences of his sin overwhelmed and hu 
miliated him. 

Anah Hurst found her way down the stairs to the main hall. 
Sylvia was waiting with a tired, awe-stricken face. Neither 
asked the other any questions as Dr. Trewartha drove home 
ward over the dark, silent road. 

Mrs. Redmond was still too weak and hysterical to give any 
advice, so Rachel Braisted ordered the burial of Sylvia's father. 
At St. Albans there was a general dispersion, owing in part to 
the lateness of the season as well as to the terrible tragedy. 



 

Mr. Gilliat sought his friend Milnor the next morning, 
who was shocked at the change a night had wrought. He 
seemed quite like an old man, with his gray, wrinkled face, 
hesitating gait, and slow, wandering speech. 

" Milnor," he began, "I place this matter in your hands. 
It may not be quite as we think. If there is any chance to 
to prove the young man innocent, throw no obstacle in the 
way. And if you will see him you may be able to judge 
better." 

Mr. Milnor was silent from amazement. 

"Yes, see him. Bring me a report. That is all." 

"Anything in my power shall be most cheerfully done, 
rest assured of that." 

' ' And now we must make preparations for our return to 
Rothermel. Mrs. Gilliat is most anxious to get away." 

" But will she be able to take the journey?" 

"She has resolved upon it." 

After Beatrice Gilliat came out of her long, death-like swoon, 
she began to gather strength and courage for this step. She 
would have been glad of Mrs. Redmond's company ; but that 
was quite impossible, for Margaret Redmond was utterly 
crushed by the two blows, and the downfall of her brightest 
hopes. James Redmond had been to St. Albans, had plead 
for an interview with his daughter, and met with a cold repulse. 
What Margaret would have done finally, she hardly knew; 
but she was determined not to confess James Redmond's ex 
istence until Sylvia's marriage was accomplished. But to do 
her justice, she had no thought of his dying so soon ; and she 
was humiliated by the fear of his having repeated the substance 
of the conversation. Then to her mind Sylvia was in some 
way answerable for Eustace Gilliat's death, and the loss of 
honor and wealth that might have accrued to her. 

It was past midnight when they reached the cottage, where 
Janet McRae was anxiously waiting. She wisely forebore to 
question, but took Sylvia in her arms like the tenderest of 



 

mothers. Trewartha threw himself on the sofa ; but no one 
slept, thinking of him whose abode was a prison cell. 

Victor Hurst had been overwhelmed by the mass of evidence 
against him. No one realized more clearly than he the terri 
ble situation in which he had been placed by the culmination 
of untoward circumstances. He could hardly believe it at 
first, and the coroner's verdict stunned him. 

But keener than all was. the other shame and agony the 
secret that he had read in his mother's eyes, the thought of the 
hatred that had been a subtle, underlying curse. If his hands 
were clean, was his heart quite clear ? There had been jeal 
ousy and envying from the night of their first ill-fated meeting. 
And yet would he have willingly changed lives with the law 
ful son of Kirke Gilliat, have taken his narrow soul, his vapid 
brain, his indolence and vices ? 

No : a thousand times no ! He saw clearly now, how little 
birth and so-called pure blood could do for a man. A large, 
true, earnest soul was needed to lift him out of the slough up 
there, as well as down yonder among the shops and crowded 
streets. A man must work for himself, though all these helps 
were far from being despised. He had toiled night after 
night on the lines of some drawing, where books or a teacher 
would have opened his eyes hours sooner. And there, in his 
little nook among the ledges of the mountain, he had tried to 
cut the secret ambition of his soul into shape. He understood 
now what it was. For the sake of that love and desire he 
could endure poverty, cold, hunger, and loneliness cheerfully, 
so that he might succeed at the last. 

Yet in a dim, far-off way he was beginning to see other 
truths. Was ambition the best thing to life ? Were there not 
duties, sacred trusts, grand truths to be evolved and applied 
to every-day matters ? 

And now, remembering Eustace Gilliat, as he had seen him 
more than once, with his flushed face and watery eyes, the 
effeminate, sensual expression of his weak countenance, he 



 

fancied what John Hurst must have dreaded for him. There 
were temptations on every hand. This young man had his 
father's position to keep him up : he, Victor, would have gone 
swiftly down the rushing current. At this moment he did 
John Hurst full justice. In some strange way he seemed to 
understand what there had been to go against his own hot, 
headstrong temper, his hasty, unreasoning dislikes, and the 
impossibility of one soul reading another so perfectly that all its 
wants and hungering could be fathomed at a glance. Human 
ity was grander and more abstruse than a bit of rock or 
clay. 

In these communings he lost sight of the fate which girded 
him about. There was a Hand in it all, whose workings he 
could not master in his thoughts; a scheme of something 
that he was not wise enough to translate. But he felt the 
Power in this awful night of loneliness, the Mightier spirit 
guiding the work of justice which will surely come hereafter 
if not here. He had been kept from staining his hands with 
a brother's blood, even though the whole world believed him 
guilty. God only could bring out the truth. He seemed to 
realize how impotent all- human strength and foresight were, 
and he cried to God, not in despair, hut with a faith that grew 
strong even while it trembled. 

Janet McRae and Sylvia left early the next morning. Tre- 
wartha went to Taunton and heard some tidings which he took 
to Victor at once. 

"An odd enough circumstance the first end of the 
mystery that I fancy we can unravel. If Smith Carson could 
have known he would have given this testimony at the inquest. 
He sold the pistol to your brawler Jarvis, only the day before 
the murder. He has seen and identified it. Some months ago 
he bought it of a young fellow rather hard up for his next 
meal, and it was lying in the shop-window with a lot of other 
traps. He remembered the letter ' H. ' " 

Victor raised his awe-stricken face. " I see," he said, in a 



 

slow, husky tone, for the words well-nigh strangled him. 
" The shot was meant for me !" 

And then he buried his face in his hands. What strange 
power had intervened ? Who only but God, meting out the 
punishment to some farther back sin could have turned aside 
the fatal messenger. Why should Eustace Gilliat have been 
taken, and he left ? 

For up to this moment he had believed it some unseen 
enemy of Gilliat's. 

Trewartha came and laid his hand upon the yonng man's 
shoulder. 

"After all, you had nothing to do with it; and if report 
speaks truly, his life was not likely to be much of an honor 
to any one." 

"But I can never forget that his life has been given for 
mine. " 

" Not willingly ;" with a short, abrupt laugh. 

The deeper and more solemn significance to him Trewartha 
would never know. But when at length he raised his face, 
there was a new and solemn expression in it that no years 
would ever be able to obliterate. 

" So I placed the matter in the hands of an officer immedi 
ately, and a warrant for Jarvis will be taken out at once. I 
think by noon bail can be arranged, and you will have com 
parative freedom. I shall be glad, for your father is fretting 
sorely. " 

Ah, he should never question that love again. 

" Do what is best," he answered quietly. 

But Trewartha could not take it so calmly. He had already 
stirred up half of Taunton, and now, if possible, there was 
more excitement than before. Jarvis had been hanging round 
the quarry on the .day of the murder, considerably intoxicated, 
and had been heard to utter threats then, as well as several 
times before. When the matter came to be thoroughly sifted, 
there was enough suspicion to justify his arrest. 



 

Janet McRae was all warmth and eagerness when she heard 
the tidings. 

"Use every effort," she said to Trewartha. "Spare no 
money nor pains." 

Then her horses were ordered and she drove over to Taun- 
ton, gaining her point at length, for she brought Victor home 
to his mother. 

"Take him back," she cried. " Heaven knows he is worth 
all this and more. And if the testimony I gave went against 
you, it tore my own soul to utter it. I would have cut off my 
right hand sooner." 

He clasped the hand in his, and bowing reverently, kissed it. 

" I owe you a debt that can never be repaid," he returned 
brokenly. 

' ' No, no ;" turning her head away and speaking loudly. 

Then the mother and son were left alone. He placed his 
arm around her neck and drew the weary head to his broad 
shoulder. 

"It is God's hand. I have been a blind, insensate stone; 
nay worse, a doubter, a mocker. But last night I was alone 
with Him ! And when a man comes face to face with this 
strong arm he calls fate " 

"There is no such thing. It is God working in all and 
through all, resolving the tangles we make of our lives in our 
blind way. Our human wisdom is foolishness." 

He knew it then. He had cried out and kicked against 
the rough stones in his way, but not one had been placed there 
without a purpose, since through it all he had been led to see 
more clearly. Not that the old shame would be lifted, but 
made to serve a wise purpose in some way yet to be revealed. 
For humanity itself was growing to be a so much larger thing 
in his mind. When he saw how every simple act affected 
some other being for weal or woe, he understood how neces 
sary it was to keep the springs of the soul pure and true, to 
save one man from the mire and foulness all around, if he 



 

could do no more. It was not wealth or culture or ease 
and leisure that redeemed souls, although these helped, and 
his eyes were too clear now to rush to the other extreme and 
undervalue them; but they were not all. Back in the shop the 
men's coarseness and vile breath had annoyed him, yet he 
doubted if their sins were worse in God's sight than that of 
the refined and fastidious Kirke Gilliat. 

You will see that the old spirit of self-aggrandizement was 
falling off, like the dry, useless leaves that enclose the fruit- 
bud. They were needed once, for there is no purely useless 
thing in. the economy of nature ; and as a man's soul must 
be brave and earnest and helpful within before it can work 
profitably without, when it comes to blossom the unsightly 
husk may wither and drop it is not needed. He felt now that 
there was a wider work in the world than that for one's 
own self. 

' ' Yes, " glancing out to the barred sky of sapphire where 
the coming night brooded with infinite tenderness. "He" 
nodding to the adjoining room, "held the key to the mystery. 
I don't know whether God called him to give up his life and 
all, but to-night I would rather have his work, even to the 
poor, feeble souls which he has helped redeem, than anything 
Kirke Gilliat has done." 

She came and looked into his eyes, kissed him on the lips 
with speechless love, like a blessing after long waiting. 

"Not that I have come to that height where I can forgive 
him. We make our greatest mistakes in fancying that we can 
change the current of our natures in a few hours, when instead, 
it is a lifelong work." 

"And we find the old evils that we have imagined conquered 
coming back from the graves where we laid them. It is a war 
fare all along the way. The promise is 'to him that over- 
cometh.' " 

To him that overcometh evil. Not to him who wins the 
glories of this world fame, wealth, position, and honor alone. 



 

There was a better, broader sphere, the deep mystery of things 
unseen, that might gain neither reward nor simple justice in' 
this life ; but they were God's immutable laws, nevertheless, and 
on the other side of the sapphire sky He took these things into 
His own hands. 

Trewartha worked indefatigably. In less than a fortnight 
Jarvis had been found, concealed in a low den. When the 
braggadocio of liquor had been strong upon him, he had 
weakly made some damaging boasts. One circumstance after 
another, trivial in itself, came to light, and began to form a 
conclusive chain of evidence. Public opinion swayed at once, 
and Victor became a sort of hero, partly on account of his re 
markable escape from a doom planned for him. 

Another peculiar circumstance occurred, which brought with 
it a keen surprise and pleasure the sudden reappearance of 
Paul Latour, who had been searching vainly for his friend, 
and on the first tidings of his danger had found his way to 
Cragness. From him Trewartha and Milnor heard the episode 
at Bohmerwald, which exonerated Victor completely. 

With this array of evidence before the grand jury, the indict 
ment was changed, and Victor Hurst honorably cleared from 
the slightest suspicion. 

Milnor hastened to Rothermel with the tidings ; his sympa 
thies warmly enlisted in the young man's behalf. 

" I regret nothing so much as that I did not make a stronger 
effort to see him when Miss Lowndes wished me to. With all 
her shallow assumption she was right enough here." 

"You think him talented, then ?" 

The voice had a curiously hollow sound, and the hand on 
which Kirke Giiliat rested his face trembled visibly. 

" They are peculiar people all these Hursts. The mother 
has a quiet strength in her soft, sad eyes, and she worships her 
son passionately. I don't know what the father has been, for
