She laid the baby back in his crib, and 
gave another longing glance out of the 
window. 

“I think you might go,” her mother 
said, presently; “it’s only four now, and 
if you could be back by a little after five. 


Jamie ouglit to take a good long nap; 
he hasn ’t slept hardly any to-day. ’ ’ 

‘ ' Oh ! I should like to so much. ’ ' 

Laura 's conscience checked her. She 
felt that she ought to stay in the house, 
in case she might be needed; hut there 
was Ann downstairs, and if the baby 
would sleep ! 

‘'Yes, you can go.’' 

Mrs. Preston felt that Laura had been 
confined a great deal lately, and the 
frowning face did not promise very 
pleasant companionship. However, it 
cleared up wonderfully now. 

‘‘Oh! thank you, mamma! Ifil be 
back real early. ' ’ 

Laura ran upstairs, and slipped on her 
white dress. Ann had begged her to 
save it nice for another Sunday, “the 
ruffles were so botherin’ to iron”; but it 


was the very ruffles that she liked. Then 
she gave her hair a brush, tied on her 
blue sash, and went down. She ought 
to go in and kiss poor, pale mamma; 
but then she might wake the baby. So 
she stole softly along, lingering a mo- 
ment on the porch. Was that sound the 
little rascal Jamie waking up again? 
No, she guessed not, and down the walk 
she ran. 

They had played one game when she 
reached Bell’s handsome house. She 
was very glad that she had dressed her- 
self so prettily, for here were Bell’s 
cousins, and Mrs. Cummings and some 
lady visitors were looking on. 

'I’m so glad you’ve come !” exclaimed 
Bell; '‘we had to take that stupid Sarah 
Gaines, who hardly knows a mallet from 
a bean-pole. Now, we’ll have some fun.” 



your day out, I suppose, Laura, 
drawled Bessie Livingston. heard 
that you'd turned child’s nurse.” 

That vexed Laura, and a heat flashed 
to her face. 

take care of my little brother some- 
times,” she said, haughtily; yet she 
wished in her heart that she didn’t have it 
to do. 

"Come, Blue, run to your place!” said 
Bell. 

They all went at it in great earnest. 
Laura was a capital player, generally, 
but this afternoon her hand didn’t seem 
very steady. She lost her patience 
easily; she felt flurried, and nervous, 
and warm, and found she was on the 
losing side. And then there was an un- 
comfortable misgiving tugging at her 
heart. If the baby should wake, if Ann 



was busy or out, and poor mamma did 
look unusually pale! She might have 
guessed that mamma had been worrying 
with the baby all day, when she said he 
had not slept any; but just then she did 
not want to think of any one besides 
herself. And now, she couldn’t help 
thinking, and the balls became confused 
in her mind. 

Until ten months before, Laura Pres- 
ton had been an only child, and, of 
course, indulged a good deal. She 
seemed so sweet and good-tempered al- 
ways, but it was because there had been 
nothing to try her. At first, she pro- 
nounced the baby splendid, and cared for 
nothing else— tended him, caressed him, 
did yards of tatting, crocheted him a 
blanket and a cap, and worked him a 
little skirt. Then her interest began to 



flag; he took so much time, and was 
really a great deal of trouble. 

For the last month, Mrs. Preston had 
been quite poorly, and the baby a greater 
charge. Laura grew tired of him, she 
secretly confessed to herself, though it 
did seem wicked. But it was hard to give 
up every moment. 

Mrs. Preston saw with pain that Laura 
was developing many selfish and un- 
amiable traits. Sometimes she won- 
dered whether it would be best to relieve 
her of all charge of the baby, or perse- 
vere until she had learned one of the hard 
lessons of life, to think of others for 
something besides pleasure. Yet, to do 
Laura justice, she had never been quite 
so cross as on this day. 

She didn’t enjoy the playing half as 
much as she expected. Bell thought she 




wasn’t trying at all, and did not care 
liow slie played, and presently the game 
came to an end. Lanra said she must go 
home, but Bell begged her to come in 
and see her new dresses. 

'‘How beautifully yours is made!” 
Mrs. Cummings said. ‘'Bell, Miss Lang 
must see this waist ; I ’d like one of yours 
puffed in that fashion.” 

So Bell took her into the dressmaker, 
and, somehow, the time passed rapidly. 
The clock struck six. 

‘‘Oh! I must go”; and Laura made a 
fresh start. 

Flying out of the gate, her skirt 
caught, and, in her haste, she couldn’t 
stop, so her beautiful dress, that she 
was so glad of having worn five minutes 
ago, now had a great, unsightly rent 
across one breadth. 


 


Laura uttered a passionate cry, more 
in anger than sorrow. The whole day 
had gone wrong, for that matter; but, 
first, a little girl had not been quite right 
in heart. 

The doctor’s carriage was standing 
before the door. He generally came in 
the morning, and a sudden fear seized 
the child. There was one of the neigh- 
bors with little Jamie in her arms. 

"Oh!” she said; ‘‘mamma—!’’ 

“Hush! dear — mamma is much worse; 
she has been bleeding at the lungs. This 
great baby is altogether too much for 
her; the doctor says she must have a 
nurse. ’ ’ 

Poor Laura! She seemed turning to 
stone. If she had not gone out!— and 
now, if mamma died, it would be all her 
fault. 


 


Jamie held out his dimpled hands with 
a smile. It seemed then as if her heart 
would break. Two hours ago she had 
thought him such a trial, and would have 
felt relieved if there had been no Jamie 
in the world— he loved her so much, too. 
She hid her face in his dress, and wept 
bitterly. 

Don’t cry, dear; she isn’t dangerous. 
I don’t exactly know, but if she keeps 
quiet, and isn ’t worried, she will get well 
again. Poor sister! tell her not to cry, 
Jamie.” 

Jamie patted the soft, curly head, and 
said,' '‘Ta-ta, ” as if he would comfort 
her. But Laura’s heart was so full that 
she ran off to her room, and buried her 
face in the pillow of her own little bed, 
wanting to beg God not to punish her as 
she deserved, but afraid even to pray. 

 


Presently, some one called her; it was 
Ann's voice, and, changing her dress, 
she went to the kitchen. 

‘ ' Oh, Miss Laura ! ’ ’ and Ann stopped, 
as she saw the pale, tear-stained face and 
swollen eyes. 

‘'When was mamma taken so hard?" 
she asked. 

‘‘About an hour ago. The baby's 
been very troublesome all day, and he's 
a heavy lift for a sick woman. I was 
going to ask you to do some errands. Miss 
Laura, but if youdl set the table. I'll
go.’ 

Laura was glad enough to do anything. 
Before she was through, the doctor went 
away, and Mrs. Brown came out with the 
baby. Then Laura heard a quick, 
familiar step. She waited with a beat- 
ing heart; but Ann returned, finished 




preparing the supper, and yet papa had 
not left the room. Baby began to worry, 
and Laura took him. When the dear 
little arms tightened round her neck, 
the quick tears rushed to her eyes 
again. How could she have thought 
him a trouble, and been glad to get 
away ! 

When Mr. Preston came in, he kissed 
Laura and Babie Jamie, asleep on her 
shoulder. She couldn’t eat or hardly 
speak, but listened to Mrs. Brown and 
papa. They didn’t seem to think Mrs. 
Preston so very ill, but Laura really was 
afraid she would die before morning — 
and what if she never kissed her again ! 
Then she remembered how she had 
slipped away in the afternoon, and her 
heart smote her bitterly enough. 

A long while after, everything in the 

 


house was quiet— baby sleeping soundly 
in bis crib, Mrs. Brown and the nurse in 
Mrs. Preston’s room, and Ann gone to 
bed — only poor Laura sitting in the 
kitchen alone. 

‘ ‘ My dear child ! ’ ’ her father said, en- 
tering the room. 

‘'Oh, papa!” She sprang up, and 
was clasped to his breast. 

' ‘ Hush ! my darling. Mamma is very 
comfortable, and not in any danger. 
All she needs is good care. She has 
worried too much with the baby, but we 
will have a nurse for him.” 

"Oh, papa! that is what I want 
to talk about. I’ve been so wicked; 
I don’t know as anyone can ever for- 
give me, and if mamma had died, I 
should always have felt as if T had killed 
her. ’ ’ 


 


‘‘Why, my child!’’ Mr. Preston began, 
in astonishment. 

“Yes, I ought to have stayed and taken 
care of the baby. I knew mamma was 
weak and sick, though she didn’t say that 
she had worried with him all day ; but it 
seemed to me that I hadn’t been any- 
where for ever and ever so long, and I 
did want to play croquet with the girls. 
I didn’t enjoy hardly a moment of it, 
though, and now I am so sorry that I 
went. ’ ’ 

Laura’s voice broke down entirely 
then, and she was sobbing in her father ’s 
arms. 

“My little girl,” he said, gravely, 
“this is a hard lesson, indeed. It is 
doubtful if mamma would have been 
quite so bad if she had not overtasked 
herself ; but the doctor said the bleeding 

 


was not from her lungs, and that it is 
really better she should give up, and 
have good care taken of her. We shall 
have a nurse for Master Jamie. I pro- 
posed this some time ago, but mamma 
thought it was best for you to have some 
little charge of him, seeing that he was 
your only brother. But it does confine 
you very much, so long as she is not well. 
Only, my little daughter ought to learn 
to think for others, or she will be in 
danger of growing up a selfish, un- 
amiable woman.’’ 

‘'Oh, papa! I don’t believe I ever 
shall forget again,” sobbed Laura. 
"And if mamma gets well — ” 

think she will. Let us both pray 
earnestly. ’ ’ 

Laura did not ask to see mamma that 
night. She determined to bear bravely 

 


the punishment she had brought upon 
herself, and she prayed a long while that 
she might be kept purer in heart, and 
learn to be unselfish. 

She did not forget the next morning. 
Laura was a neat, handy little girl, and 
could do a great deal when she chose. 
She helped Ann now, and took care of 
her brother in such a pretty, winsome 
manner, that Ann quite forgot the scold- 
ing she meant to give her— for the maid 
felt herself one of the family, she had 
been with them so long. 

Laura was glad at last to be able to 
go in and see her mamma. They had a 
tender talk about the incidents of the day 
before, and Mrs. Preston felt satisfied 
that they would make a lasting impres- 
sion upon her. 

I do not mean that Laura was alto- 


 


getlier perfect after that, for every- 
one has to try daily and honrly as 
long as he or she lives; bnt she tried 
to think of others, and to make them 
haj)py, and she found, as people always 
do, that she was the happier for it her- 
self. 

Mrs. Preston recovered, to Laura’s 
unbounded delight. They had a nurse 
for Jamie, but the little rogue thought 
his sister much to be preferred, and Mrs. 
Preston was thankful to see so cheerful 
a spirit growing up within her. If ever 
she felt tempted to fret, or felt a frown 
rising to her sunny brow, she tried to 
check it immediately by remembering 
the sad night she had passed when 
mamma was so ill. 

Ann could not help scolding about the 
torn dress, and Laura took it very 



meekly. It was part of her lesson, she 
admitted— the one all children have to 
learn— that their own way may not be 
the best, even if they can be indulged 
in it. 



HERE’S something to buy sugarplums 
with,” Uncle Mark said, 
with a good-by to his little niece 

Jessie. 

She kissed him and gave him a good, 
hard hug, by way of showing her grati- 
tude. After he had gone, she opened her 
hand and smoothed out the rumpled note. 
It was a dollar. 

Jessie Marsh was used to having con- 
siderable spending - money. Uncles, 
aunts, and cousins kept her pretty well 
supplied. She was one of those bright, 
merry girls who are always smiling and 




happy, and a great favorite with every- 
body— ready to do a favor, hold a skein 
of yarn for grandmother, look np her 
papa's slippers, and run upstairs or 
downstairs for a misplaced or forgotten 
article. Perhaps this was why she re- 
ceived so many gifts of one kind and 
another; for even visitors at the house 
always went away with a pleasant re- 
membrance of cheerful, obliging Jessie. 

Mr. Marsh was in very comfortable 
circumstances, and extremely indulgent 
to his little daughter. She was the only 
girl, and there were four boys in the 
family. If Jessie expressed a wish for a 
book or a toy, he always brought it home 
to her. I am sorry to say that Jessie was 
rather careless and extravagant. To be 
sure she made glad many a child’s heart 
by gifts of her playthings when she was 




done with them, but she tired of them 
very soon and wanted new. Pennies, 
quarters, and even half-dollars, often 
went for some trifle that presently lost 
interest for her. Mrs. Marsh tried to 
check this fault in her daughter, but her 
father generally came to the rescue. 

"Let her take her own pleasure with 
the money, ’ ’ he would say. " I dislike to 
see children mean and parsimonious." 

But Mrs. Marsh took every occasion 
to direct Jessie, although her advice was 
not always followed. 

Jessie was still holding her dollar in 
her hand, as her mother re-entered the 
room. 

"See what Uncle Mark gave me— to 
buy sugar-plums with, he said, ’ ’ and 
a radiant smile illumined Jessie 's 
face. 





‘ ' And only yesterday yon were wishing 
for a dollar,’’ her mother replied. 

The smile faded a little at that. Jessie 
had been listening to a poor woman’s 
story the day before. Mrs. Marsh had 
given her some sewing, as she was very 
anxious to earn enough money to pay her 
rent. Counting up what she was likely 
to get from one and another, left her 
still a dollar or two short. Ordinarily, 
Mrs. Marsh would have overpaid her, hut 
now she had a mind to put Jessie’s gener- 
osity to the test. The little girl had been 
quite thoughtful for some time after Mrs. 
Adams ’s departure, and at last had said : 

"Oh, mammal I wish I had a dollar; 
I should give it to Mrs. Adams. How 
hard it must be to earn money enough 
to take care of herself and those three 
little children!” 




“Yes,’' her mother answered, gravely. 
‘'We ought to be thankful that God has 
placed us above want.'’ 

Jessie went to her bank. It never had 
a very large surplus on hand. Twenty 
cents— that was not near a dollar! So 
she gave a little sigh. 

This was what her mother’s words re- 
called. She looked rather sober over it 
for several moments. 

dollar is a good deal for a little 
girl to give away,” she said, slowly, as 
the result of her thoughts. 

"It did not seem so yesterday. It 
is often easier to be charitable with that 
which we do not possess. ’ ’ 

" One can ’t give them when one hasn ’t 
anything, ” Jessie said ; and the absurdity 
made her smile a little. 

"And it is unfortunate not to have 





the heart and the money at the same 
time. ’ ' 

Jessie did not reply. It was nearly 
schooltime; so she hunted up her hood, 
her squirrel tippet and muff, and her 
good, warm cloak. She had never suf- 
fered from any cold or neglect, and there 
was a sudden rush of gratitude in her 
heart, for it was a sweet, true, and tender 
heart. 

'‘Good-by, mamma, and she came to 
kiss her. Then she strapped her books 
together and hung them on her arm and 
ran down the path. 

Should she give Mrs. Adams her dol- 
lar! There were so many things that 
she wanted. She just halted at Warner’s 
store-window. There was a box of 
paints that were only a dollar— she had 
made two or three inetfectual attempts 




to save up her money and get them. 
And there was a crying baby with the 
loveliest blue eyes. Her dolly was past 
the crying stage— she would just go in 
and price this one— it was such fun to 
have the squeaking little thing ! ‘ ' Seven- 
ty-five cents.’’ It was a beauty. And 
there was a lovely toy in the shape 
of a pretty carved egg-cup, with an egg 
in it. When you touched a spring in the 
bottom, the upper half of the egg flew 
off, and the prettiest little fairy made 
you a bow. That was a dollar. And a 
drawing-slate, with such a charming 
variety of landscapes, castles, birds, 
flowers, and nearly everything. Oh ! 
what beautiful things one could buy with 
a dollar! 

‘'Will you take this baby!” and the 
shopwoman made it cry like a real live 




baby, and all the while there was such 
a roguish look in its blue eyes. 

"Not just now,’' Jessie said, faintly, 
and turned away. 

‘'Oh! you like this cup better’'; and 
then the woman made the fairy spring 
up so suddenly that Jessie jumped, too. 
How she could startle the boys with it ! 

won’t take any of them now,” 
Jessie said, with sudden determination, 
and then went out. She had to run to 
school to be there in time. 

At recess, Martha Lee displayed a 
beautiful rubber ring with a pearl in it. 
It looked so pretty on her white, slender 
fingers. 

‘ ' It cost just a dollar, ’ ’ she said, ‘ ' and 
I saved up all my pennies to buy it.” 
Then she let Jessie try it on. The boys 
had made Jessie several rings, but they 




had not the smooth finish of this. And 
then the pearl ! 

mean to have one/’ exclaimed Bell 
Anders; ‘‘I’ve about seventy cents saved 
up.” 

Jessie looked at her finger and decided 
that she wanted one, also. To be sure, 
there was her pretty birthday ring, with 
rubies, but that wasn’t black. The pearl 
looked so lovely in the jetty setting. 

Poor Jessie! By the time she had 
gone home to dinner and come back 
again, Warner’s store seemed as full of 
treasures as the magic cave, and there 
were so many things that cost just a dol- 
lar. Her money was fast burning a hole 
in her pocket. It seems strange that it 
should have this faculty, but it does ap- 
pear to produce a curious kind of com- 
bustion. Did you ever feel your fingers 




tingle and burn when yon touched three 
or four pennies in your pocket, and could 
you not almost taste the delightful taffy- 
candy that the little old woman, two 
doors from the school, sold? 

Mrs. Adams ' pale face and troubled 
eyes interfered with Jessie’s peace of 
mind. She certainly thought yesterday 
that if she had a dollar she would give 
it to her. Why did she not want to now ? 

Clara Adams hasn’t been to school 
to-day,” Miss Trusdell said. "Who 
goes near her house?” 

Jessie swallowed a great lump that 
seemed to rush up from her heart. 

'I’ll call. Miss Trusdell.” 

Thank you, Jessie. Clara ought not 
miss a day. I am afraid she is sick. ’ ’ 

So Jessie went around by another path, 
almost afraid to pass Warner’s again. 




It was a cold December day, cloudy now, 
and with the appearance of snow. The 
wind nipped Jessie’s rosy cheeks, but 
she did not mind. Here was the little 
cottage— rather cold and forlorn-looking, 
it must be confessed. Jamie answered 
her tap at the door. 

‘‘Oh! come in. Miss Jessie!” Mrs. 
Adams exclaimed; and Jamie shut the 
door quickly, so the biting air would 
not rush in. 

“I called to see why Clara wasn’t at 
school to-day,” Jessie said. 

Clara blushed. Mrs. Adams looked 
rather troubled. 

“You’re not sick!’ 

“No, Miss Jessie, it wasn’t that. But 
Clara hasn’t any shoes. She would 
freeze her feet in thosfe old ones ; besides 
they’re out to the ground.” 




Jessie cast a furtive glance at them — 
old and shabby, indeed. She thought of 
her own half-worn boots, but although 
Clara was a smaller girl, her feet were 
larger than Jessie’s. No, that would not 
do. 

‘‘I ordered her a pair at Mr. Gregg’s, 
and they ’re done, only he will not let me 
have them until I pay down a little. 
And I’ve just money enough for my rent, 
which is due to-morrow. Mr. Dallas is a 
hard landlord.” 

‘'Then you have all the money?” 
Jessie said, gladly. 

' ‘ Yes, I am thankful for that ; hut Clara 
must wait until next week. I shall have 
to earn some more.” 

Jessie talked to Jamie and Charley 
quite a while, and listened to the praises 
of her own dear mamma, who was always 




doing a kind turn for everybody. And 
a plan came into her mind ; but then she 
could not have a crying doll, nor a paint- 
box, nor any of those charming toys that 
she half coveted. She said good-by to 
them presently, and went straight to Mr. 
Gregg’s. 

A woman in a faded shawl was stand- 
ing by the untidy counter. She had been 
binding some shoes, and brought them 
home. 

can’t give it to you, because I 
haven’t a cent in the place,” Mr. Gregg 
was saying. ‘ ' People won ’t pay me, and 
I can’t pay others.” 

"But we actually haven’t anything in 
the house— not a mouthful of dinner 
even”; and here the poor woman’s 
tremulous voice broke down. 

Jessie felt like crying, too; but she 




winked away the tears with a great 
effort. Then she asked Mr. Gregg about 
Clara 's shoes. 

‘ ' There they are, ’ ' he said, rather 
brusquely, and nodded his head toward 
a stout pair standing on a little shelf. 
‘'Good, strong ones, too, and dirt cheap, 
yet they can’t pay for them. I’m done 
trusting; it’s a poor plan, and keeps me 
like a beggar.” 

Then he hammered spitefully upon 
his lapstone, and looked savage. He was 
a surly old fellow. 

‘‘Will you let her have them if I give 
you a dollar now, and promise to pay 
the rest if they can’t?” Jessie asked, 
bravely. 

“Yes, Miss.”
