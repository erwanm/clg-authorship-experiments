Philip's eyes asked another question, for his friend had once 
announced his intended marriage, with all a lover's ardor. 

" Yes." And Richard briefly went over the episode of 
the past summer. He felt the fond clasp of the hand, more 
truly comforting than words could haye been just then. 

" And now your story ? " he said, when he had finished. 

The childhood that had been happy to Richard was spent 
by his friend in a lonely house, with a morose, unsocial 
old man. The first visit to Dr. Bertrand's opened Philip's 
heart to a new and wonderful world. Not only friendship, 
but religion, had come to him like a revelation. In this 
house he had learned to know God : under this very tree he 
had chosen to enter his Master's vineyard as a worker. 
When his grandfather heard of this resolve, his anger was 
fierce and deep. The boy should not throw himself away. 
He would have no canting parson among his descendants. 
Immediately after Philip had graduated, he declared his in- 
tention of taking him to Europe. In this extremity the 
young . man applied to Dr. Bertrand for advice. It was 
simple and straightforward. His grandfather had reared and 
educated him ; he was the only near relative the poor old 



 

man had. To leave him now would be ingratitude. His 
duty was in " that state of life to which it pleased God to 
call him." So Philip Gregory took up his cross ; left behind 
him dear friends and sweet hopes ; bore patiently with 
fretful complainings, real and imaginary illnesses ; looking 
steadily forward to the answer of a good conscience as his 
reward, until God should set him free, and open the way for 
a higher service. 

Philip recounted his wanderings in lands rendered sacred 
by song and story. He made no hardship of those exiled 
years. 

" But I thought you were to inherit his fortune ? " Richard 
said, with a little astonishment. 

A warm color suffused Philip's face, as he answered, in a 
low tone, " I could not submit to the conditions." 

" What were they ? " The tone was not curious, but 
pleasantly authoritative. 

" We never agreed on religious subjects, you know. It 
was the one bitter point between us ; and at last he said, if 
I was resolved to become a clergyman after his death, I 
should never have one penny of his to waste on such nar- 
row, bigoted notions. One day he angrily made a will, dis- 
inheriting me ; and then held it before me, promising to 
destroy it if I would give up my folly. Many a time after- 
wards he placed the temptation before me. Don't think me 
miserably weak, Richard, if I confess there were moments 
when I almost yielded. I used to fancy how much good I 
could do with such a fortune ; but the denunciation rang in 
my ears, ' Woe is me if I preach not the gospel.' I could 
not sell my birthright for a mess of pottage, even if I was 
fainting on the highway. After a while the subject dropped. 
Sometimes he would threaten to send me away, but in his 
weak state he was too much at the mercy of servants. Yet 
the last days were very pleasant. He always regarded me 
with a sort of tyrannical idolatry, much as he had treated my 
poor mother. During the winter at Florence he behaved 






with more consideration, and sometimes would follow me 
about with strange, wistful eyes, that seemed to have a ten- 
der regret in their depths. One afternoon he asked me to 
read whatever pleased me. Occasionally I had taken up the 
Bible ; he used at times to like its grand imagery. I turned 
to Isaiah now, and read quite a while. Presently he put out 
his hand, saying he was sleepy. I don't know how long I 
held it. I was watching one of those glorious sunsets, and 
thinking of the country beyond this glowing sea of purple 
and amethyst. When I turned he looked very peaceful, and 
laying his hand gently down, .I went to give some directions 
to the servants. After the physician came I ordered lights. 
He had not stirred from the position in which I left him ; but 
the soul had fle d. What passed at the final moment is known 
only to God. No one dreamed of its being so sudden ; but 
I was more than thankful he had died at peace with me." 

There was a silence of some moments. The shadows un- 
der the tree were lengthening, and crimson, instead of gold, 
was sifted through the leaves. 

" He was buried at Florence," Philip resumed. " Balti- 
more, his native city, profited by his wealth. I have only 
the small portion my father left me ; but it will be more than 
sufficient for my present purposes. I am thankful no duty 
towards him was left undone." 

Richard's clasp of his friend's hand tightened. How full, 
how compassionate it was, both understood. "You have 
done nobly," he said. 

" Don't praise me. I have often doubted my own faith, 
my love to Christ. How many times I longed for a good 
talk with your father to set me right ! I meant to come 
to you immediately ; but I met Mr. Chaloner, the old Hilton 
clergyman, in Baltimore, and he persuaded me to begin at 
once. I had not a day to lose ; so I went to studying with 
an earnest purpose, knowing well your faith could trust me 
for all it was impossible to convey in letters. O Dick, my 
friend, how pleasant it is to be here again, and find you un- 
changed amid so many changes ! " 



 

" And you have begun your true life now," Richard said, 
with a grave smile. " May God prosper you in it." 

" Amen." The young man's tone was deep and rever- 
ential. 

" Where is Mr. Chaloner ? " Richard asked, presently. 

" At Rothelan, up the Hudson. The dear old man con- 
siders it an earthly paradise, and has spoken for my vacation ; 
but first love had an earlier claim." 

The dying sun was leaving behind him seas of amber and 
crimson, and a fine white fog came creeping down the river, 
stretching out threads of filmy beauty to catch the rays of 
opaline splendor, and weave them in a thousand fantastic 
shapes. The friends rose, and walked slowly up the garden 
path. Tessy was coming to meet them. 

" Mabel said I should call you to supper," she began, shyly, 
looking at Philip from under her long lashes. "And it's 
on the balcony." 

. He put out his hand, but she clung to her brother. 
Glancing up, his eyes took in a charming picture. The bal- 
cony almost hidden, and fragrant with honeysuckle blooms ; 
the table with its snowy drapery, pure white china, and 
cut glass ; two vases of flowers, brilliant and artistically 
arranged ; dishes of luscious fruit ; a plate of choice biscuits, 
just tinged with richest brown, and some dainty cream-cakes. 

This little feast was in special honor of their guest, as the 
late dinner rendered such a meal unnecessary. Richard was 
compelled to leave them shortly afterwards, and Mabel ac- 
cepted her position as hostess with a quiet ease and dignity. 
She had some difficulty in restraining Lily's high spirits, as 
Mr. Gregory's lively sallies brought her out almost too 
rapidly. 

They were engrossed with music when Richard returned, 
held captive by Mr. Gregory's fine performance. His mas- 
terly hand evoked a strange pathos from the full, deep chords, 
or broke into soft, faint murmurs, that floated out on the night 
air, to die amid summer sweetness. 





Presently he found a well-worn copy of Handel's " How 
beautiful are their feet," and persuaded them into singing it 
with him. Mabel's voice was soft and clear, like the ripple 
of a forest brook ; Lilian's contralto, rich and deep. As the 
grand melody swelled out in notes of exquisite beauty, Tessy 
crept up on Richard's knee, and twining her arms around 
his neck, said, with a quivering sob in her voice, 

" It seems just like Heaven doesn't it ? Dick, if 
the clouds could only open, so we might see papa for a 
moment ! " 




CHAPTER XII. 

But who could have expected this, 

When we two drew together first, 
Just for the obvious human bliss, 

To satisfy life's daily thirst , 

With a thing men seldom miss ? 

ROBERT BROWNING. 

IT would have been impossible for a guest like Philip 
Gregory not to fraternize thoroughly with the Bertrands, 
even if there had been no old remembrances to fall back 
upon. But now there was a charm in those boyish recollec- 
tions that roused Richard from his too literal present. 
There were many elements in both natures that would have 
harmonized under any circumstances ; but with the griefs 
and experiences of the past, and a sense of brotherly love 
that had outlived years of separation, came a still stronger 
regard the superstructure of a lasting friendship, built on 
an imperishable foundation. To Richard, an intimate friend 
of his own age, viewing things youngly, and enjoying with 
the ardor and keenness of a rich, overflowing nature, was 
indeed a luxury. Both had made some painful sacrifices, 
had been strengthened with the same faith, and taken up a 
future widely different from their fair, first dreams. Richard 
was grave and rather calm of temperament one of those 
souls that accumulate gradually, and wait for a strong central 
fire to rouse their highest emotions. Unselfish in a great 
degree, it was invariably his custom to hope first for others, 
and in some cases take no note of himself one of those 
spirits oftenest misunderstood. Philip would have been as 
ready for sacrifice or noble deed ; but in him there was a 
certain warmth and desire, a faculty of seizing the golden 


time of enjoyment, of taking present happiness with almost 
boyish ardor. Richard needed a salient influence like this 
to start anew the hopes of his heart. 

In another way he was very attractive to Mabel. He had 
been a visitor in the house when her mother was the presid- 
ing genius ; he remembered the old songs she had sung, the 
flowers she had worn in her hair, and books she used to 
read little trifles that came back with a forceful ten- 
derness to the girl's heart. Besides Richard, no one ever 
talked of her mother. To the younger children, their father 
had so thoroughly supplied her place, they rarely looked 
back with the longing regret common to motherless chil- 
dren ; so the peculiar nearness of the relation had been felt 
more exclusively by Mabel. Philip seemed intuitively to 
understand this, and was never at fault with the shy girl. 

Indeed, he seemed almost to have the gift of ubiquity. 
He romped with Tessy, sailed in Archie's boat, talked, sang, 
went out with Richard, and indulged Lily's never-failing 
inquiries about the countries and curiosities he had met 
with. For one so apparently thoughtless, she evinced a 
strange fondness for descriptions of travel or natural scenery. 
Everything on this point was devoured with avidity. She 
soon became absorbed in Philip's brilliant word-pictures. 
He was terse and vigorous, possessing the rare faculty of 
transporting his hearers to the scenes that moved his elo- 
quence, until they fairly beheld with his vision. And when 
he lingered in the glowing orient, or sailed slowly over 
tropical seas, his very voice sank into summer ease and 
indolence, until Lily laughingly declared if she was not so 
deeply interested she should certainly go to sleep. 

Richard insisted that she resembled the skipper's wife in 
Eothen, " who had an inquiring mind and an irresistible ten- 
dency to impart her own opinions, and looked upon her 
guests as a piece of waste intellect, to be carefully tilled," 
which seemed to amuse Philip exceedingly. 

A week passed rapidly. They had done absolutely 



 

nothing, and unanimously declared that Philip must remain 
longer to be entertained. They would sail up the river, and 
spend a day in the woods ; they would go to Passaic Falls, 
and take rides to Eagle Rock, and all places of interest in 
the surrounding country ; and he consented without requir- 
ing much persuasion. Their dinner in the woods was a 
decided success, and their rides wonderfully enjoyable. 
They had not been so happy since their father's death. 
Richard expanded into new life. , 

Philip entered the parlor one evening where Mabel sat 
amusing herself with some old-time ballads. She glanced 
up in surprise. 

" I thought you had gone with Richard," she said. 

" There was a medical association on hand, I believe ; so 
I concluded to return. Where are the children ? " 

" Tessy, tired out, is asleep ; the others are in Mrs. Charl- 
ton's, playing tableaux. Shall we follow them ? " 

"It is too fine a night to remain in doors. What do you 
say to a moonlight row ? It will be niy last chance, for I 
must go to-morrow." 

" Well," she said ; and running up stairs for her shawl, 
paused a moment to inform the housekeeper. Mr. Gregory 
was waiting for her on the balcony, and they walked slowly 
down the path, drinking in the intense loveliness of the 
night. The moon was at its full. Great golden stars seemed 
melting into blue ether, and white, weird drifts, like phantom 
fleets, floated across the sky. Every tree and shrub seemed 
frosted with liquid silver, and each wave of the river tipped 
with a diamond crest, while the reflexes trembled in pearl 
and azure. The air was fragrant with late roses, honey- 
suckle, and the aromatic odor of the trees. 

Assisting Mabel into the boat, he pushed out so as to 
clear the shallow shore. He liked to linger in these green 
glooms at the river's edge, and watch the slender spires of 
shrubbery, that, waving to the slightest breeze, sent troops 
jf dancing images over the tremulous reaches of water. 





Slow, faint swells of the outgoing tide, rhythmical plashes of 
oars, the voice of a flute, and the far-off echoes of some 
singers, filled all the air with melody. It was as if the drift- 
ing motion carried them to the very verge of fairy-land. 

Did they know whither they were hastening ? that in their 
very midst, bounded neither by shining river or shadowy 
shore, lay a land of bliss more potent than those magic realms 
of eld, and he who treads them is a captive as secure as if 
fay Vivien's chain had wound him three times about ? No ; 
the full pulsation of both hearts was too new to be inter- 
preted. Philip Gregory's thoughts had not deepened into 
desire. In coming back to the Bertrands, he fancied he 
took up the old life, and was content. 

During that brief fortnight, a change had come over 
Mabel. The roses, the summer, and herself, all blossomed 
together. She drank in large draughts of quiet, measureless 
joy ; her intuitions became refined, her whole being perme- 
ated with a glow of emotion at once tender and profound. 
Fearlessly she left behind the golden glory of girlhood's 
untroubled sea, and became a woman. No lingering regret, 
no troublous misgiving concerning the future ! the bless- 
edness of faith that comes to many with their first love ! 
Let us take courage, and thank God that it is so. 

They went far off for a subject of conversation. Some- 
thing about the Nile, clustering palms, fragrant waxen lotus 
blooms, wild Egyptian or Arab melodies that left Shelley's 
sweet song ringing through her brain : 

" The wandering airs, they faint 

On the dark, the silent stream ; 
The champak's odors fall 

Like sweet thoughts in a dream; 
The nightingale's complaint, 

It dies upon her heart ." 

After Philip Gregory turned the boat, an exquisite silence 
fell over them. His heart took in the picture Mabel made, 
to the minutest detail. The willowy form, the stately head, 



? 

with its luxuriant bands of soft-brown hair rising out of the 
snowy, fleecy wrappings that fell loosely around her shoul- 
ders, the fair face, with tender, drooping eyes, the slender 
hands folded in her lap, how lovely it all was ! 

Floating on in this idle manner, neither noticed a sail-boat 
that, from dilatory management and lack of favorable wind, 
was making eccentric tacks across the river. Impelled by 
a vigorous hand, it flew shoreward, and met Philip's bark 
with a violent concussion. Mabel sprang up, and with the 
cry of affright there was a flutter of a shadowy dress across 
his vision, a scream from the opposite party ; and obeying 
the first impulse, Philip found himself reaching through the 
water with strong arms for something dearer than life. 

" See what you've done now, Jem ! " said a coarse, but 
not unkindly voice. " Didn't I tell you to leave that sail 
alone ? " 

" Who thought of a boat being here ? I never saw them 
until we struck," was the rejoinder. 

The first speaker brought Philip's boat around, and sprang 
into it, with instructions to his companion to " hold on for 
life." As Philip reached the surface, he cried, cheerily, 
" Here ! " and stretched out his arms for the burden. There 
was no alternative ; so Philip resigned it, and scrambled in 
himself. 

" I'm awful sorry," said the man ; " but it's darkish right 
along here, and we never saw you. I wouldn't 'a done it for 
a mint of money. Think the young lady's hurt ? " 

" No, she has only fainted." 

" Perhaps we better help you," said one of the girls, 
leaning over the side of the boat. 

" No, thank you ; we shall soon be home ; " and seizing the 
oars, He sent the boat along with vigorous strokes, hardly 
daring to breathe until he came in sight of the house. 
Then he raised the fair head, and rested it against his knee. 
There was a languid flutter of the eyelids, a faint movement 
of the lips, and he clasped her to the heart that still quivered 





with intense emotion. Murmuring in a low, convulsive tone, 
" O, my darling ! my darling ! " he covered the face with 
passionate kisses. 

She Jay quite still, encircled with one arm, while with the 
other he brought the boat around, and fastened the chain. 
Lifting her tenderly out on the coping, he found her able to 
stand. When he would have taken her in his arms again, 
her girlish bashfulness protested. " I can walk," she ex- 
claimed. " I am not hurt." 

" Thank God ! " was all he said. Then she felt herself 
borne up the terrace steps, and through the garden, as if she 
had been thistle-down. Releasing her in the hall, where the 
gaslight sent shadowy rays through its globe of ground glass, 
he glanced earnestly in her face a moment. It required an 
effort to deny himself the words he most wished to say, but 
her paleness gave him strength. " Shall I call Ann ?" he 
asked, instead. 

She was trembling violently, partly from fright, and partly 
from flashes of feeling that ran over her like seas of fire one 
instant, and the next chilled her with keen frostiness. She 
was glad to lean on his shoulder, and said, with childish en- 
treaty, " Take me up stairs first." 

The confidence evinced by her request thrilled him with 
joy. He bore her to the sitting-room, and had just laid her 
on the lounge, when Ann emerged from an opposite apart- 
ment. 

" Miss Mabel ! " and she held up both hands. 

" Hush, Ann ; it was only a slight accident. Not a word 
to any one to-night. Mr. Gregory is wet through also." 

" Yes, I must leave you," he said, in a lingering tone, as 
if it pained him to go. Then he pressed her hand to his 
lips. She flushed redly. 

" And the doctor not in ! " ejaculated Ann, recovering a 
little from her surprise. 

" Well, I don't need him ; " and Mabel laughed at the ludi- 
crous aspect of affairs. " He wouldn't know where to find 



 

me any dry clothes all I want just now. Will you get 
them ? " 

As thanks for her assistance, Mabel briefly went over her 
adventure, trying to keep her voice steady, and her face 
from that troublesome crimson. Lily came flying up stairs, 
and the sisters began to prepare for bed, for Mabel felt 
anxious to hide herself from everybody. It seemed as if 
they were all going to demand her secret immediately. 

Half an hour later Philip tapped lightly at the door. 
"How is Miss Mabel?" he asked, in a low tone. 

" O, she's comfortable, and in bed. Didn't she come near 
getting drowned, Mr. Gregory ? Are you quite sure ? " 

" Yes ; " and he laughed a little. " I should not have let 
her drown. We were in no great danger, though. Good 
night ; " and he was off, for he heard Richard at the hall 
door. He had no wish to take any person into his confidence 
that night, but he spent a long while in prayer, thanking God 
for more than one blessing. 

It was not very early when he came down the next day. 
Pausing in the hall, he caught a glimpse of a white morning 
dress, with violet trimmings. Obeying his first impulse, he 
entered the parlor. Mabel paused in her work, laid down 
her gay feather duster, and glanced up with a beseeching 
look, her face all one rosy flush. 

" Are you quite well ? " he asked, hurriedly, " and recov- 
ered from last night ? I don't know what I am to say for 
being so careless : we were so in the shade that I was more 
to blame than the other party. I should have kept better 
watch." 

" And I should not have started up. It was partly my 
fault." 

There -vas a long silence. They stood by the open win- 
dow, their hearts beating audibly. Then he drew her gently 
towards him, and without questioning the face, pressed his 
lips to hers. A faint, tremulous motion answered him her 
first kiss; and in that mute caress the. soul of her girlhood 
oassed into Philip's keeping. 





" I have hardly any right to say this," he commenced 
slowly, " beginning my life over again, as I am ; but when 
I perilled your safety last night, I learned how dear you were 
to me. Can you wait, Mabel, for what I hope to offer you 
by and by ? " 

She hid her face on his shoulder with the abandonment of 
perfect trust. 

" The sweetest of all answers," he said, raising it and 
kissing the quivering lips. " You love me even as I love 
you." 

Richard looked in at the door. " ! " he exclaimed, 
turning away. 

" Come here, Richard ; we want you ; " and Philip held 
out his hand, adding, with a little heightened color, "the 
usual reward of hospitality." 

Richard grasped the extended hand warmly. In his face 
was fullest approbation. 

" Don't answer until you have heard my story," Philip said, 
with frank ingenuousness. " You may not feel like trusting 
me with any of your treasures ; " and in a voice that had to be 
governed a little to keep it calm, he related the events of the 
preceding evening, not so much to excuse what might seem 
a hasty proposal, as to satisfy his own frank nature. Mabel 
listened with downcast eyes, and crimson face, as Philip went 
over the still incomprehensible moment when love had so 
suddenly surprised both hearts. Richard read the expres- 
sion perfectly. 

"My dear Philip," he began, in a full tone, "you can 
hardly understand my satisfaction. Had the power been in 
my own hands, I could not have chosen more wisely for her. 
I know I am right in saying the position you will have to 
offer her will be more in consonance with her own tastes 
than mere worldly aims. As for the years of waiting, if 
your love is true, the real fine gold of life, it will be un- 
changeable. If not, it is best to learn the fact before the 
irrevocable word is spoken." 



 

" As if it could change or fail ! " and Philip Gregory 
passed his arm proudly over Mabel's shoulder, while she 
half unconsciously placed her hand in his. 

Was it strange a pang of desolation should pierce Rich- 
ard's heart at sight of this perfect faith ? A waft of mem- 
ory swept a furrow through the waving grass, and disclosed 
the ruined temple in his soul. 

" No, no," he returned, hurriedly, " I have no fear for 
you, and Mabel's heart is truth itself." Bending down he 
kissed the fair face. 

She clasped her arms around his neck, and exclaimed, in 
a self-reproachful tone, " Richard ! I ought not to love 
any one better than you ; " yet the lingering cadence con- 
fessed that she did. 

" If it was any one but Philip, I might not consent so 
readily," he replied, gayly, as the breakfast bell rang. 

She ran away to cool her cheeks ; but Archie upset all 
composure a moment afterwards, by crying out, " She didn't 
look a bit like a drowned girl ! " 

They were barely seated, when Lilian began a lamentation 
about this being Philip's last day, declaring it was positively 
cruel in him to leave them with so many promises yet unful- 
filled. 

'' I'm not quite as hard and unpersuadable as the Rock of 
Gibraltar," he said, gravely ; " so, Lily, if you will make out 
a very tempting programme for another week, I may take in 
Newark on my way back." 

Thus encouraged, Lily began to count up the books there 
were still to read, the places that absolutely ought to be 
visited, and made such a formidable list, that Philip declared 
himself quite vanquished. 

" There ! " she exclaimed, triumphantly, and with charm- 
ing naivete, "you were wishing yesterday, Bel, that he 
would stay, and I dare say you never thought of coaxing 
him." 

Lily's keen eyes might have discovered that there was a 






secret, if Richard had not rushed to the rescue. On leaving 
the breakfast-room she carried Philip off in triumph, but was 
vexed to leave, a while later, just as she finished a little favor 
for Richard, that he had gone to walk with Mabel ; and it was 
nearly dinner time when they returned. The parting was 
brief and full of hope for all. 

That evening Mabel came to Richard of her own accord, 
as if she needed the seal of his words to assure herself all 
was right. There was no mother to soothe the blushing 
cheeks arid palpitant nerves, no girlish friend, in whose fond 
bosom she could confide her trembling joy ; but he made 
amends for all, with his tender thoughtfulness and wise 
counsel. 

And thus Richard Bertrand made another essay in his 
position as head of the family. Unconsciously he had come 
to lean on Mabel since the stay of his own heart had been 
wrenched away. The nobleness and purity of her character 
attracted him strongly. But instead of keeping her for a 
friend all the future years, he was suddenly called upon to 
yield his claim for one that must inevitably grow dearer and 
more absorbing. There was a little pain, but no jealousy ; 
he loved Philip too sincerely for that. 

One by one they would go to other homes those happy, 
loving children ! He could not quite banish the lost dream 
of his own past the hope that should have made fadeless 
sunshine for all time. As he grew older and graver, amid 
cares and duties, fair young girls, with fresh, eager hearts, 
would pass him by. Yet he did not regret Ada, nor think 
impatiently of the charge so solemnly given him. He re- 
membered a wise hand had written, "It is good for a man 
that he bear the yoke in his youth." Far better than a 
weightsome cross in after life. 



DB. BERTKAND'S HOUSEHOLD. Ill 



CH-APTER XIII. 

"God sets some lives in shade, alone; 
They have no daylight of their own; 
Only in lives of happier ones 
They see the shine of distant suns." 

THE annual visit to Cape May, that had been thrown into 
the background by Mr. Gregory's unexpected arrival, was 
now discussed. To Lily's surprise, she found Mabel quite 
disinclined for the journey; and as Richard .did not press 
the matter, the number of travellers dwindled one half. 
But Archie had no fancy for giving up his anticipated pleas- 
ure, and Lily gravely announced the fact " that she could 
have all the fun she wanted at aunt Sophy's, and be back by 
the time Mr. Gregory came." 

As for Mabel, she hardly dared take a comprehensive 
view of her own happiness until the house was quiet, and no 
curious eyes remained to come upon her suddenly at some 
defenceless moment. In the long days that followed she 
had plenty of time for thought. Her first feeling was one 
of surprise. Her own estimate of herself was lowly ; she 
wondered how a man, brilliant and talented as Philip 
Gregory, could have dreamed of choosing her. And then 
the life he had marked out for himself, could she ever 
become a fitting companion for such a man and such a 
destiny ? 

Her communings might have been more troubled than 
pleasant but for Richard. He smoothed out the tangled 
path of difficulty, restored the drooping courage, and was, 
as Mabel afterwards told Philip, a perfect Mr. Great Heart. 




He understood readily the charm such a pure nature held 
for a man of quick resolution, refined and enthusiastic, yet 
continually occupied and excited by human interest. Philip 
could mould it, with his force of character, into whatsoever 
shape he liked. She was gentle, but not weak ; yielding, 
yet not indolently passive. Her high, true faith, her gen- 
erosity, tempered by a fine sense of justice, would be excel- 
lent qualities in her new life. She also possessed that 
graceful dignity which was winning in itself, and demanded 
from others a certain respect. E\jen the very obtuse would 
not be likely to trample on her. 

During that brief separation she received two letters 
from Philip. With a delicacy only the highest mind could 
have evinced, he startled her with no rapturous declarations 
of love, and asked for no answers until he came himself. 
The weeks flew by rapidly. Indeed, she was hardly ready 
when the frank, electric voice greeted her, and the earnest 
eyes demanded their full meed of affection. 

They had one delightful day to themselves a day in 
which they sat under the old elm, and, as Philip said, " be- 
came acquainted with each other." It was an odd state for 
Mabel, who had never yet dreamed of a lover. 

" How little I thought, a few weeks ago, that, before I 
went back to college, two new and blessed hopes would be 
added to my life, that for years had looked so solitary," Philip 
said, musingly. " In Mr. Chaloner, I have found a more 
than friend a father. Mabel, I wish you could see 
that little nest among the hills ! The village proper is back 
a short distance from the river's edge, the old gray stone 
church and vine-embowered rectory forming a sort of con- 
necting link. To the right, all along the river, the scene is 
beautiful, and varied by numberless charming summer resi- 
dences some standing on hills with sloping lawns, some 
hidden among rocks and trees. There is scarcely anything 
in all Italy more lovely. Mr. Chaloner has been at Rothelan 
nine years, and the people love him devotedly. His long, 



 

white beard, and the flowing hair that clusters about his 
temples in loose waves, give him a benign, patriarchal ap- 
pearance. He is nearing seventy, yet he is earnest and 
vigorous in all good works, patient with poverty and ignor- 
ance, and O, so kind to the little ones ! Three years ago 
he lost his only son, who was shortly to take holy orders, 
and become his father's assistant." 

" How sad ! " Mabel returned, in a tone of truest pity. 

" Yes.; I wonder it did not entirely break him down. Hia 
faith and resignation are beautiful in the extreme. And 
now, my darling, I come to something that concerns you, or 
must at least have your assent." 

" Concerns me ? " was the wondering rejoinder. 

" Yes ; are you not linked in with every thought of my 
future life ? " and he drew the fair form nearer to him. 
" Before I left Mr. Chaloner, he made me an offer that was 
at once generous and affectionate. He will need an assist- 
ant ; indeed, he ought to have one now, but the place seems 
sacred to him, because it was destined for his son. Judge 
of my surprise when he asked me if I would be willing to 
come by and by." 

"And you will," she said, in a tone scarcely less sweet 
than the south wind that went whispering above them. 

" Would you like a country life ? Mr. Chaloner wishes to 
be rector at Rothelan while he is able to toil in the vineyard. 
He has a small income of his own, but, at best, the salary 
of the assistant would not be very large. Then the two 
families would have to make one at least, that is his idea. 
The rectory is roomy enough, and in addition to this, he 
gave me a word of advice, especially relating to you." 

Mubel colored, but looked incredulous. 

" He suggested I should marry, and bring my wife there ; ' ! 
and Philip raised the sweet face to note the effect of his 
communication. " I might do better, you know," he said, 
Kith a smile, " and you may prefer something grander." 

" Philip ! " The tone was tenderly reproachful. 

My darling ! " 



" It must be as you wish," she said, with quiet determina- 
tion. " If I trust 'you with my heart, can I not trust you 
with all things else : And Mr. Chaloner has been your 
friend so long." 

He could not forbear kissing her. 

"Yes," he went on ; "to Mr. Chaloner and your father I 
owe all that is and will be truly good in my life. He was 
the clergyman at Hilton, where I first met Richard at board- 
ing-school. And now from Richard's hands I take one gift,
