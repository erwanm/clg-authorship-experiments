“Good-bye, mother. Yes, my money’s all 
right, father. Here, Winnie, give us a kiss, 
sir. Patty, you there? Good-bye to you all. 
I ’ll write as soon as I get there. The small 
trunk, John, in the entry — all right! Now, 
Gypsy, Gypsy! Where is the child?’’ 

Her arms were round his neck, and her head 
was on his shoulder ; she followed him out to 
the gate, kissing and clinging to him, quite de- 
termined not to cry, and making up by the 
means a series of horrible faces. 

“Oh, Tom, what shall I do without you? 
what shall I do ? ” 

“ Shake Winnie and break lamp-chimneys,” 
began Tom, after his usual style, but choked 
and stopped short. 

“I don’t know what a fellow’s going to do 
without Gypsy,” — and giving her a great 


hug, he jumped on the box with John, and 
never looked back. 

Gypsy watched the coach rumble away, grow 
dim in the clouds of dust, grow small, grow 
less, become a speck, vanish utterly. Then she 
went into Tom’s desolate room, bare of its 
familiar pictures, books, and clothes, strange 
and cold for want of the merry eyes, the ringing 
laugh, the eager step that had belonged to it 
and been a part of it since the boy was a baby. 
She locked the door, sat down on a heap of old 
newspapers in the middle of the floor, and did 
what Gypsy very seldom did, — cried as hard 
as she could cry. 


seven o’clock he was sitting in his room 
alone, feeling, to tell the truth, — well, we 
won’t say homesick, but something very much 
like it. His chum was gone out, though that 
was no great loss, for the boy was a com- 
parative stranger to him ; they had seen each 
other for the first time when they came to be 
examined in the summer, and had engaged 
rooms together because it happened to be convenient ; 
Hall took, as every one did, a fancy 
to Tom at first sight, and both being tired out 
with tramping after boarding-places, they had 
met in Elm Street, found just such rooms as 
they wanted, and were glad enough to unite 
their fortunes for the sake of getting them. 

Tom had reached New Haven in the after- 
noon, unpacked his trunks, put away his clothes 
and books, hung his pictures, bargained with 
his landlady for the luxury of a chair with four 
legs (there being none in the room possessed 
of more than two or three), gone to supper at 
his club and come home again ; he had read a 
newspaper and dusted off his table, arranged 
and re-arranged his books, eaten some of his 
mother’s pears, looked his photograph album 
through three times from beginning to end, 
rather wished he could look into the windows at 
home and see what they were all doing, and 
now he was tipped back in his chair, — the 
four-legged one, — against the wall, wishing 
that he knew what to do next, and that it would 
not have such a way of growing dark early. 



For some reason, — whether there could have 
been any homesickness about it or not we will 
not undertake to decide, — the solitude and the 
gathering twilight grew at last intolerable. He 
brought his chair down with a jerk, tossed on 
his cap, and started out for a walk. He strolled 
along past the colleges, and under the elms, 
hanging somewhat yellow and sere now in their 
tossing, netted arches ; tried to look at the 
Sophomores as if he thought them no better 
than himself, did not succeed very well, wished 
he were through Freshman year, and finally, by 
way of something to do, decided to run down 
to the office. Not that there would be anything 
there for him, — of course there was no chance 
of that, though he wished there were, sadly 
enough ; but he would go down just for the fun 
of the thing. So he went, and carelessly ran 
his eye over the list of advertised letters, through 
the A’s and B’s, and was just turning away 
when, lo and behold ! — “ Breynton, Thomas.” 

“Not from home so soon, surely,” thought 
Tom. But it was from home, directed in 


Gypsy’s hand, — and the hand, by the way, 
was very much like Gypsy, sharp and decided, 
and adorned with various little piquant flourishes,
but with a remarkable tendency to run 
over the line and under the line, and everywhere 
but on the line, and not entirely guiltless of blots, 
— to Thomas Breynton, Esq., Freshman, Yale 
College, New Haven, Conn., U. S. A., North 
America, Western Hemisphere.” 

“ The rogue ! ” said Tom, between his teeth, 
as he took it from the hand of the laughing 
clerk; “ I guess she ’ll get her pay for this.” 

Hall met him on the steps as he passed out 
tearing open the envelope in a great hurry. 

“ I say, Breynton, hilloa ! That you ? Come 
over to the Tontine with a fellow.” 

The Tontine was no place for Tom, and he 
knew it. WTether he would have preferred it 
to his lonely room and the dreary gathering twilight,
if it had not been for that letter, I cannot 
say. But at any rate. Hall had this for an 
answer : — 

“ No, thank you. I have something else to 



do. Don’t you wish you had a sister to write 
to you the day you leave, sir?” 

“ Don’t know but I do,” said Hall, looking on 
rather wistfully. Tom walked off radiant. 

The dreary twilight was dreary no longer; 
the dark and lonely rooms seemed all at once 
like home. He lighted his lamp, tipped back 
his chair, and read as fast as most college boys 
read their first letter from home, I fancy : — 

Monday, September the something or other, 

One o’clock P. m., in my room, on the bed. 

Best beloved of Thomases, — Here you ’ve 
been gone only seven hours, and I have so much 
to say I can’t begin to say it and it isn’t of a'ny 
use and I don’t know what I ’ll do when you ’ve 
been gone a week only I ’ve asked father to 
bring me up a ream of paper from the store 
because I know I shall use as much as that 
before you get home. 

Oh, dear ! I haven’t put in a scrap of punctuation 
in that long sentence, only one funny little 
comma, that looks exactly like a pol — polly — 
how do you spell polliwog? — at the beginning; 



and I never could correct it in the world, for I 
shouldn’t have a sign of an idea what belonged 
where. I ’m going to put in a lot ; of semi- 
colons ; along here to ; make up ; 

What do you suppose? — Miss Cardrew asked 
Fanny French to-day what a semicolon was, 
and she said she believed it was a place where 
ministers went to school. Did you ever? I 
laughed till I choked, and was just as red in the 
beet as a face — I mean — well, you change it 
round right yourself; I can’t stop. Then Miss 
Cardrew told me I ’d laughed enough, and that 
made me laugh all the harder, and Delia Guest, 
she went into a coniption, — you know she 
always does when anything happens, anyway, — 
and we had the greatest time you ever knew. 

But, then, this isn’t the beginning, and I meant 
to commence there. I always do jump at things 
so. 

You see, after you ’d gone, I just went into 
your room and — don’t you tell, will you? but I 
did — I cried like a little goose. You’d better 
believe your table looked homesick enough, and 



your closet with nothing but your linen coat 
hanging up. I banged the door to, I got so 
mad looking at it. 

Ow ! look at that blot. I was only just shaking 
my pen round a little to get off some of the 



ink. I never ! if it hasn’t gone all over the bed- 
quilt ! I got up here to write because it ’s easier, 
and then — well, somehow, my chairs are always 
filled up with things. What do you suppose 
mother’ll say? Isn’t it a shame? 

Well, after I tho light I ’d cried enough, you 
know, Winnie ’d been banging at the door so 
long I thought I ’d let him in, and you ought to 
have seen him ! He had on one of your old 
coats that mother gave to Patty to give to her 
cousin’s husband that has the consumption, and 
he ’d corked a moustache that went clear out to 
his ears, and then he had a Mother Goose under 
his arm ; said he was going to be Tom now, and 
have his room, and study Aunt Abbieses (I sup- 
pose he meant Anabasis) ; he didn’t wish to be 
disturbed ; I might go away so he could lock 
the door. 

Well, you see that made me laugh, only it 
would have been just as easy to cry again, and 
mother was wiping her eyes, and father was 
coughing and looking round, and so I went 
out-doors to see if I couldn’t laugh some 


way. It is so horrid not to feel like laughing, 
isn’t it? 

Then Sarah Rowe came over, and she didn’t 
seem to mind it a bit because Francis was gone; 
but then she says he ’s been gone so much, now 
it is Sophomore year. I wonder if I sha’n’t mind 
it by the time you ’re a Soph. She says I sha’n’t, 
but I don’t believe any such a thing. Then you 
see I just felt as if I must have a good time some- 
how, and the kitty came out, and we all went to 
playing, and I got into Mrs. Surly’s yard before 
I thought. You know I never do think, any- 
way. So you see the puppy he came out and he 
went at the cat, and she put up her back and ran 
off mewing, and he after her, and I after both 
of them. That dog he wrung a cat’s neck once, 
and I wasn’t going to have him wringing ours, 
£0 I never thought, and she put down into the 
cellar kitchen, and I went too, and I never looked 
nor anything, and I went splash ! into Mrs. Sur- 
ly’s tub of starch, and over it went, all on me, 
and the floor, and the cat, and the puppy, and 
Mrs. Surly. 



Well, it wasn’t very hot, and we weren’t any- 
body burnt very much but the puppy, and good 
enough for him ; but I thought I should go off 
laughing, and you ought to have heard Mrs. 
Surly scold. She should like to know if that was 
the way my ma brought me up, and if I didn’t 
know children ought to be at their book instead 
of tumbling down their neighbours’ cellars and 
upsetting their neighbours’ starch, and burning 
their neighbours’ dogs, and she should tell my ma 
of me and my conduct before the sun went down. 

So what should she do but come marching 
over just before dinner, with the longest lingo, 
but of course I ’d told mother all about it before- 
hand, and she tried to look sober and tell me I 
must be careful, but I could see her laughing 
right out of her eyes the whole time. 

We had mince pie for dinner, and I missed you 
more than ever. How you did use to pull out 
the raisins! We had some tomatoes too. 

Oh, Tom, I do miss you ! Everybody sends a 
world of love. I ’ve been counting the weeks till 
you come home. You have the nicest part of it. 

It ’s always harder to stay at home and think 
about it than it is to go off and do it, I think. 

It does seem to me as if I thought about you 
all the time pretty much. If you were to be 
such a boy as Francis Rowe, I believe I 
shouldn’t know anything what to do. 

How horrid it would be if you were to learn 
to swear. Please don’t. But of course you 
wouldn’t. 

Write me all about the Sophs, and who gets 
hazed, and everything. I should think it would 
be perfectly mag, to go to college. I think it ’s 
real mean girls can’t. 

Wouldn’t it be nice if you could peep in the 
door now, and let me hug you? 

Your very loving 

GvrsY. 

P. S. I send a blue neck-tie. I meant to 
get it done before you went, but I didn’t. I 
sewed on it some in school, and Miss Cardrew 
made me lose my recess for it, — just like her! 
Blue is real becoming to you, you know. You 


used to look dreadfully handsome in the other; 
something like — well, like Haroun Alraschid, I 
think; then sometimes like Major Winthrop. 
The girls used to go crazy over his photograph, 
because it did look so much like you. They 
haven’t any of them got such a brother, and I 
guess they know it. Why, if there isn’t another 
blot, and I haven’t any more idea how it came 
there than Adam. G. 

On Friday night, as Gypsy was passing her 
father’s store on the way home from school, Mr. 
Simms, the clerk, came to the door and called 
her. 

“Here’s a letter for you. Miss Gypsy; it 
came in with the rest after your father had gone 
up to the house. It’s a — really a very peculiar 
looking letter. But then there always is some- 
thing peculiar about you, you know, my dear.” 

“ Oh, thank you, Mr. Simms — yes, I know 
I ’m always doing things out of the way, but — 
dear me ! I never did! Did you ever? That 
old Tom ! Why, what did the postman say? ” 



Tom had certainly “paid her” richly. The 
letter was enclosed in a flaring crimson envelope, 
conspicuous anywhere, especially so at York- 
bury, where crimson envelopes were few and far 
between, and it bore this inscription : — 

“ To Miss Jemima Breynton, R. R. Terror 
of puppies and elderly ladies. Enemy-in-espe- 
cial to starch-tubs and study-hours. Enemy- 
in-general to the peace and order of society in 

Yorkbury, Vermont.” 

“ I have been wondering what R. R. could 
possibly stand for, my dear,” observed Mr. 
Simms, mildly. 

“Oh, that’s a secret between Tom and me,” 
said Gypsy, between her shouts of laughter, 
and started for home on the run, to show the 
letter to her mother. 

If any reader should share Mr. Simms’s curiosity 
to such an extent as to suffer seriously 
from loss of sleep or appetite, he is hereby 
confidentially referred to the first volume of Gyp- 
sy’s history for a solution of the mystery. 



I think it necessary to say, however, for the 
sake of my reputation as a historian, that this 
misdirecting of letters is a sorry joke, with 
about as much wit in it as there is apt to be in 
young people’s fun, and that I am not givin 
my sanction to any such lawless proceedings. 

The letter, though so obviously directed to 
Gypsy, contained only a slip for her ; the note 
itself was for her mother. 

“ A letter from Tom ! a letter from Tom ! a 
letter from Tom ! ” shouted Gypsy, rushing into 
the house. “ Mother, do come and read it, for 
I ’m in such a hurry to hear ! Mother, father, 
all of you ! ” 

And all of them came, down to Winnie, with 
his hands and mouth full of bread and butter, 
and Patty, with broom and duster. 

“ How soon he has written, — the dear boy ! ” 
said his mother, flushing with pleasure, and read 
aloud to a breathless audience : — 

My dear Mother, — I reached here safely 
Tuesday P. M. : had a jolly time Monday night 



at Uncle Job’s; he has a decidedly pretty 
daughter, and I want her asked up to Yorkbury 
some vacation. 

Old Yale seems to conduct herself with propriety, 
and is not, mirabile dictu (“ His old 
Latin ! ’’put in Gypsy), quite as much impressed 
by the arrival and presence of your distinguished 
son as might naturally be expected, and would 
certainly be becoming in her. It ’s rather a jump 
from graduating at Yorkbury and feeling your- 
self of some importance, to being nothing but a 
“little Freshy,’’ and being treated by those un- 
utterable Sophs as if you were a lower order of 
animal, somewhere in the region of the oyster ; at 
any rate, something to which the gorilla would 
be a Milton. I met Francis Rowe on Chapel 
Street last night, and he cut me dead ; took no 
more notice of me than if he ’d never heard of 
such a being. That ’s the way they all do. 
You ’ll say it ’s ridiculous and ungentlemanly, 
and I suppose it is ; but boys will be boys, and 
college boys never think about being gentlemen, 
as far as I see. It doesn’t strike me now that I 
shall do so when rrii a Soph; but there’s no 
telling. 

They ’re hazing like everything this year. No- 
body has touched me, and I should like to see 
them try it, though a lot of them came into our 
house last night. We had all of us sat up till 
midnight expecting them, and were all ready. 
They banged open the door, and went into one 
of the fellows’ room, and set him up on a stove, 
and made him make a speech. Then they broke 
open his trunk, and tossed out all his things, and 
made him drink about half a pint of vinegar and 
pepper. That ’s very mild treatment, however ; 
in the proper sense of the word, it isn’t “ haz- 
ing” unless you have your head shaved, or are 
ducked to death under a pump, or taken out of 
bed and thrown out of a second-story window 
into a snow-bank. 

Hall and I have each of us bought a good- 
sized billy, and we haven’t the slightest objections
to using them if occasion requires. I don’t 
believe we shall be touched. 

Am having a jolly time ; study comes a little 


rough at first, though. I should like to look in 
at home a minute, well enough. Love to father 
and Winnie and all. My respectful regards to 
Patty. Will write to father next week. 

Your pears and doughnuts taste good, I tell 
you. I say, little mother, I wonder if there 
are many fellows have just such a mother as 
you. 

Tom. 

P. S. While I write, some Sophs going by 
are helloing, “Put out that light, Freshy! 
Fresh, put out that light, I say — quick!” 
Freshy does not put it out, and there come two 
stones bang against my window. You ’re pretty 
good-looking, but you can’t come in, — the 
blinds are shut. 

“What’s on your slip of paper, Gypsy?” 
they all asked, after the letter was read and 
discussed. 

“ Oh, nothing much,” said Gypsy, folding it 
up and putting it in her pocket. This was what 
was on it : — 


Dear Gyp, — Since you are interested in 
the fancy department, I hope you will be 
pleased with the accompanying envelope. 

Thanks for the neck-tie ; it is becoming, of 
course. Do I ever wear anything that is n’t, my 
dear? Your letter was prime, and came in the 
nick of time. (N. B. I am aspiring to the 
position of class poet, and this is by way of 
practice.) 

Don’t you tell, it will bother father, and 
mother will look so sober, but I made a pretty 
bad fizzle in Homer to-day; don’t know how it 
came about exactly, but it was too warm to 
study, and last night there were some fellows in. 
A fizzle, you know, isn’t as bad as a flunk ; 
that’s when you can’t say anything. I stum- 
bled through some, and made up some more ; 
but somehow it didn’t hang together very well. 
Mean to make a rush to-morrow, and make up 
for it. Be a good little girl. Try Mrs. Surly’s 
puppy with a Lucifer match, — light it right under 
his nose, and see if he doesn’t jump. 

A while after the letter came, Gypsy silently 
stole away and out of the house. 

“Where are you going?” called her mother; 
“ it’s almost tea-time.” 

“ I ’ll be back soon,” said Gypsy. “ I ’m 
going to run down to Peace Maythorne’s a 
minute.” 

“I suppose she ’s gone to tell her about Tom’s 
letter,” observed her mother, smiling. “ It is 
strange how that child goes to Peace when anything 
happens ; if she ’s very glad or very sorry. 
Peace must know all about it.” 

“ It is strange, and Peace is so poor, and has 
no education, either, Mary,” said Mr. Breynton, 
musingly ; “ you ’re not afraid of her getting 

any harm, my dear?” 

His wife laughed. 

“ Harm from Peace Maythorne ! She’s one 
of Gypsy’s greatest blessings ; she acts like a 
balance-wheel on all the child’s fly-away notions. 
Besides, she is not exactly uneducated ; suffer- 
ing teaches deeper and better than books, some- 
times. Poor thing ! ” 



“ The doctors can never do anything for her, 
I suppose?” 

“ Oh, no.” 

Gypsy, meantime, was making her way as 
Gypsy almost always made her way, — on the 
hop, skip, and jump, — down through the 
crowded, wretched streets which led to Peace 
Maythorne’s home. It seems rather hard, per- 
haps, to talk about a home, when one has noth- 
ing but a weary bed in one bare room, and a 
slow life of pain and utter dependence. Very 
hard, Gypsy used to think it was ; the mourn- 
fulness and the pity of it grew into her love for 
this crippled girl, and made of it something very 
tender, very reverent, — quite unlike her love for 
any of the strong, comfortable, happy girls at 
school. Unconsciously, too, she grew herself 
more gentle, more thoughtful, the more she saw 
of Peace. 

The very door of that hushed and lonely room 
she opened as Gypsy never opened doors any- 
where else, — softly. 

Peace turned her quiet face over on the pillow 


in surprise that afternoon, at the sight of her 
standing by the bed. 

“ Why, how still you must have been ! I 
didn’t hear you come in at all.” 

“ Do you want me? I suppose I do tire you 
to death.” 

“ Want you ? Oh, I am so glad ! ” 

“ That ’s nice,” said Gypsy, in her honest 
fashion ; “ I do so love to have people glad to 
see me ! ” 

The sunlight which flooded the room fell all 
over Peace ; her face in it looked pitifully thin 
and pale ; paler than usual, though smiling as 
it always was, and quiet. 

“ What ’s the matter? ” said Gypsy, abruptly, 
looking down on it. 

“Matter? Oh, nothing. Did I say anything 
was the matter? ” 

“ No, you never do. But something is. 
What has happened?” 

“ I didn’t sleep much, — well, not any, last 
night, that’s all. Come, Gypsy, let’s not talk 
about me.” 


“But what kept you awake?” persisted 
Gypsy. Peace made no reply. 

“ Peace, I do believe it was your aunt ! ” 

Peace coloured painfully, but she would not 
speak. Just what the girl had to bear in her 
orphaned, dependent life, probably no one ever 
knew. This was sure, — the physical suffering 
was the least of it. Yet the woman to whose 
charge her weakness and her pain were left was 
never consciously unkind to her brother’s child ; 
she was one of those people — and their name 
is Legion — who “ mean well!' but “ don't know 
how!' 

“ What has she been saying to you ? ” said 
Gypsy, in a savage undertone. 

“ Oh, nothing much ; she came home tired, 
and of course she couldn’t help wishing I could 
work, and — Gypsy, I don’t want to talk about 
it. She didn’t know I cared. She is very 
good. She put my tea back on the stove this 
morning because it was so weak the first time ; 
she did, really, Gypsy.” 

“ She ’d have been a heathen if she hadn’t ! ” 

exploded Aunt Jane’s sworn enemy. Peace 
understood that it was all for love of her, but it 
gave her more pain than help when Gypsy 
talked like this. She laid her hands down in 
Gypsy’s in a weak, appealing way, and said : 

“Gypsy — please!'' and Gypsy stopped 
short, — only tapping her foot angrily on the 
floor. 

“If you would only talk about yourself!’’ 
said Peace. 

“ That ’s what I always do when I get with 
you. Then if I say anything else, I say it all 
wrong, and I don’t see that I ’m any good any- 
way. I believe I ’ll get a piece of court-plaster 
and paste it over my mouth, and then the world 
will be so much the safer.’’ 

“ But you had something to say when you 
came in,’’ said Peace, smiling; “I saw it 
in your eyes. What is that, — from your 
brother? ’’ 

Gypsy answered by unfolding the slip of 
paper and giving it to Peace. Whether it was 
quite right to show to any one else what Tom 

was not willing that his mother should see, she 
never stopped to think. She had no secrets 
from Peace Maythorne. If this were to be, as 
she vaguely felt that it might be, the first of 
many others like it, she felt sure that she never 
could keep them from her. Fortunately, Peace 
was the very model of a confidante ; as kindly 
and inviting as a spring sunbeam ; as dumb as 
a statue. 

Peace read it and laid it down. 

“ Well?” said Gypsy. 

“I don’t know; ought you to show me 
this?” 

“Oh, Tom wouldn’t care; you’re not like 
anybody else. He knows I tell you everything. 
What do you think?” 

“ I am a little sorry. But then, all boys will 
have bad lessons sometimes, you know.” 

“Tom ought not to,” said Gypsy, with a little 
flash of pride. “ He might have been the first 
scholar in his class here, instead of the sixth ; 
Mr. Guernsey said so. There ’s no need of his 
doing so ! ” 

Peace twisted the paper about her fingers, 
thinking. 

“You see I felt sort of sorry,” said Gypsy, 
“ and so I thought if I came and told you, I ’d 
feel better. But there, I don’t see that I can 
help it.” 

“You might say something about it when 
you write.” 

“What? He’s so much older, I can’t play 
grandmother and preach to Tom. If I do, he 
catches me up in his arms and runs all round 
the house with me, and as likely as not leaves 
me up on a closet shelf, or out on top of the 
wood-pile, and that ’s all the answer I get ! ” 

“ You needn’t preach. Say just what you 
said to me, and no more, — I’m sorry.” 

“ Um — well, I don’t know but you’re right 
I ’ll think about it.” 


ONE gets used to anything, and after 
a while Gypsy became used to 
Tom’s being away. It took a few 
weeks, to be sure ; the first twilights 
were very dreary without him, the first bright 
mornings empty and cold ; the first few Sunday 
nights it was exceedingly easy to cry ; then all 
the fun seemed to have dropped out of boat-rides 
and nutting-parties; hay-cocks and wood-piles 
were a mockery ; there was a sting in the sight of 
the very cat, now that there was no one to tie tin 


dippers to her tail and make her walk through 
stove-pipes. But after a while it came to seem 
a matter of course that there should be no Tom 
about, — strange, sometimes, to think that it had 
ever been otherwise ; though his handsome, 
merry face was just as often in her thoughts, he 
himself just as dear. Then there were the 
letters. And such letters ! — eight, ten, twelve 
pages, twice a week, from Gypsy to Tom ; a 
full sheet hurried over in study hours, once a 
week, from Tom to Gypsy, which was more than 
she expected, and certainly, considering how 
many letters Tom had to write, was a great 
deal. This was for the first three weeks. The 
fourth week Sarah Rowe had a birthday party, 
and Gypsy was so busy festooning a new white 
dress with little knots of blue ribbon that she 
only wrote to Tom once, and a scrap of a note at 
that. The fifth week Tom did not write at all. 
Somehow or other it came about after this that 
Gypsy — “ well, she meant to send off her letters 
regularly, of course ; but something was always 
happening just at the time she wanted to write. 


and then she was always losing the mails, and 
one time she had her letter all written and 
ready, and Winnie dropped it into the well, and 
— well, you needn’t laugh; she would write 
three times next week and make up. But writing 
letters was horrid work, and there wasn’t 
half as much to say as there was at first; be- 
sides, she always blotted her fingers so.” 

Indeed, she had — like a few other sisters — 
been more negligent about it than she sup- 
posed. She had occasion afterwards to be very 
sorry. 

Tom said little about himself to any one, in 
his letters home. They all noticed that, as the
