"Miss Read could enact Oedipus to this riddle. Seriously, Ida, beware
of that woman! She courts Lacy's society. I do not know what the
ladies' verdict is--to us it is as plain as that he does not like
her half as well as he does you. Do not avoid him; he deserves your
favor; but do nothing to uncover her eyes--blindfolded by her egregious
conceit."

"Lynn! you confound me! What have I to do with Mr. Lacy! I have no
interests which would war with hers, were they ever so strong. Having
nothing to lose, I have nothing to fear. I am obliged to you for your
brotherly cares," she added, roguishly. "A fellow-feeling makes us
wondrous kind."

"You know it, then!" exclaimed he, his large eyes splendid in their
flash of intelligence and rapture.

"I am not insensible or indifferent, where the happiness of my friends
is concerned," she rejoined, in the same confidential tone.

Another gleam thanked her.

Ellen Morris was what is termed, a "taking girl." The high, gay spirit,
which had distinguished her among her comrades at Mr. Purcell's won
her distinction in a world willing to be amused. She had objectionable
traits, but there was also much that was admirable and loveable about
her. If her over-weening fondness for merriment offended, it was
easy to forgive one, whose lively sense of the comic was inbred and
irresistible. Still, it was a marvel that the impassioned Lynn should
recognise in her the embodiment of his poetic dream of woman. They
met before he went to Europe, and the tricksy sprite of a school-girl
was not dislodged from his memory by the lures that tried him there.
He came back to find a blooming maiden preserving the fresh, joyous
grace which had captivated him in the child--and loved! as men seldom
love--as women often do--with an abandon of affection, an upyielding
of every faculty and thought to the dominion of one sentiment--a love
that brings gladness to few hearts, and breaks many! many!

Had he asked Ida, with the disinterested equanimity, some suitors we
wot of, display, what course she would advise in this momentous matter,
she would have responded with a sister's candor, "she does not suit
you--rid yourself of your entanglement;" but it was too late;--she
must hope with, and for him. In payment for his cautionary remark,
she hinted, that, situated as they were, misconstruction and jealousy
might be formidable foes to his peace of mind:--that neither smiles nor
frowns were unerring indices of a girl's heart. He scouted the implied
suspicion.

"Jealous of these popinjays!" glancing disdainfully at the black coats
and white vests in attendance, as if he thought they contained wound-up
automata.

"The danger does not appear imminent;" said she. "See that you retain
this satisfied state of mind."

Her countenance fell, and he heard Josephine say, simperingly--

"How dramatic! pray, Mr. Holmes, is this a rehearsal, or a real
performance?"

"Most ladies are so versed in love affairs, as to understand the
symptoms at a glance;--is not your eye sufficiently practiced?" asked
he, with a curling lip.

"No, sir. I regret to say that the gentlemen of my acquaintance are not
sentimental or politic enough, to get up such scenes."

"I have no doubt you do deplore it."

"Why, Mr. Holmes!" ejaculated Ellen, with her gleeful laugh; "how
ungallant!"

"You mistake. It was a skilful combination of veracity and politeness.
I must coincide with her, and am pleased that it can be done without
violence to my conscience. I wish I could propose a cure for the evil
you lament, Miss Read, but I am afraid it is irremediable. Men are
obstinate animals."

Ida, alarmed, touched his foot; and the lynx eyes saw the slight
movement. A deadly light glowed there for an instant, and was
extinguished in softness, as she assailed Mr. Lacy.

  "'In what far distant region of the hall.'

have you kept yourself all the evening, Sir Truant?"

"Polyhymnia and Melpomene!" muttered Lynn.

"I have been a fixture in this room most of the time;" replied Morton.

"How selfish! had you no sense of duty? could you not sacrifice your
ease to secure the enjoyment of your friends?"

"It would argue ridiculous vanity in me, to suppose that my absence has
detracted from the pleasures of the assembly; and from the aspirants
for the smile of the reigning belles, so unimportant a personage is not
missed."

"Can he like her?" thought Ida. "There is still an air unlike other
men, but he does not act or speak as he did to me. He looks amused but
very careless. Oh! why must we have two faces?"

"Why did you stop me just now?" queried Lynn, pettishly. "I do not fear
her; I am rather anxious she should know the extent of my dislike."

"How will that benefit either of you!" inquired Ida.

"Don't play the saint! much consideration you owe her! I am a
good hater:--I cannot fawn and smile upon one,--woman though she
is--beggared in principle and heart. She is capable of anything. Mean
and tyrannical--those who deal with her, must be tools or enemies,--I
choose the latter alternative. I will not hear any justification.
Don't I know--cannot everybody see, that she is the trouble of your
life,--that she would murder you, but for the cowardly dread of
detection!"

"You will counsel me next, to sleep with pistols under my pillow;" said
she. "What an array of horrors you are manufacturing?"

"It is as true as Gospel. Why disclaim it? Charley told me of the vixen
before I saw her; he can be civil--I cannot--and what is more--will
not!"

"He sees, perhaps, that animosity to my friends may be an engine to
inflict suffering upon me;" answered Ida, thinking of Mr. Dermott.

Lynn coloured. "He intimated as much. I have not his self-command; he
is a better, because a more unselfish friend than I."

"I have no fault to find with you;" was the reply. "It is a comfort to
feel, that come what may, I have two brothers to depend upon."

Charley was leaning upon the back of her chair, and this remark was
made partly to him. Lynn pressed her hand, as he recovered himself from
his lowly posture, but there was as much meaning in the kind gaze of
his undemonstrative friend. Their affection was a rill of pure water,
stealing through a region of artificial light and bloom; and people
pretended to, or did misinterpret it. Josephine credited, doubted,
and was impatient by turns. One of them was the lover;--they were too
friendly to be bound upon the same errand. Lynn's manner was most
unequivocal--but his attentions to Ellen! Charley was not a marrying
man--that was settled--everybody said; but the tender respect he paid
Ida; the watchfulness that protected her from impertinence and neglect,
were weighty offsets to this popular decision;--and again, opposed to
these, were his disinterestedness in surrendering his post to Lynn, or
any agreeable companion, who sought it, and the absence of uneasiness
in his observation of her belleship.

Ida laughed at her mystification, as did those who effected
it,--frequently concerting some manoeuvre, by which to lead her
further into the labyrinth. If Charley made one of the family in the
evening, the morrow brought Lynn to drive or walk. Charley lent her
books, and imported a writing-desk from Paris, upon hearing Mrs. Dana
say that Ida had made a fruitless search through the city, for one
of a particular description;--Lynn appeared to have laid down the
brush for the spade and pruning knife, so abundant were the bouquets,
left with Mr. Holmes' compliments; and the walls of her chamber were
adorned with pictures, from subjects proposed or approved by her. But
amidst the frolicsome action of this drama, was collecting matter for
another, to be closed only with Life,--to be remembered, perchance,
with Eternity; and the chief actor danced and sang and sported, unaware
of the importance of the dawning era. All her life a dreamer, she
did not observe that the enshrined ideal was shaping itself into the
real;--that the far-off future, her hopes had sprung forward to greet,
as if to meet it half-way would hasten its lagging pace, was merging
into the brightening present. She had expected the summer to burst upon
her, with fragrance and music and sunshine, and took no note of the
swelling buds and violet perfume of Spring. And here, let not him, who
is wearied by the labors of Autumn, or numbed by the frosts of Winter,
close our humble story, with a lofty scorn, or scathing displeasure
at the prospect of a "love-tale." Rather let him unfold his shut-up
heart, and read there of his own glad May, its dancing shadows, fairer
than the oblique sun-rays that fall open his beaten track;--of the rosy
June, the redemption of its young sister's promise:--and looking sadly
upon its dust-eaten blossoms, think, with loving pity, of flower-cups
which hold the dew-drop now,--soon to fade and shrivel as these have
done!




CHAPTER XIV.


It had been predicted from the premature beginning of the winter's
gaieties, that an ebb would occur before the Southern carnival,
Christmas, and the party-goers resolved to falsify the prophecy.

Mrs. Dana called on the afternoon of the 24th to invite Ida and
Josephine to dine with her. "You will see only ourselves and Mr.
Holmes, who is Charley's shadow."

"A stupid set," was Josephine's reflection. "How pleasant," Ida's; and
their answers corresponded. The former, "very sorry, papa would always
dine at home, Christmas-day; he held it to be a religious duty she
verily believed," laughing affectedly, "and he could not eat unless she
were there."

Ida said, "I will come with pleasure, thank you," and lost all but the
main purport of Miss Read's apology, in an eager whisper from Elle, who
was with her mother.

"I don't hear, will I 'please come to what?'" lifting her to her lap.

Elle put her arms around her neck, and her mouth to her ear.

"To your molasses stew!" said Ida, "indeed I will. When is it to be?"

Another important whisper.

"Josephine, are we engaged for to-morrow evening?"

"I do not know," she replied, shortly.

"I hope not," said Mrs. Dana. "Elle's head is full of her frolic. I was
describing to her the molasses stew I had every Christmas, when I was
a child, and nothing would do but I must promise her one for 'being a
good girl.'"

"She deserves it, I know," said Ida, fondly. "I will come, Elle, if I
leave fifty grown people's parties."

"Will you, too?" asked the child, going up to Josephine. Mrs. Dana
pressed the invitation.

"I am not certain, but I have engaged to go somewhere else," said
Josephine, smiling heartlessly into the pure little face. "If I can, I
will do myself the honor, Miss Dana."

The wretched attempt at playfulness actually frightened Elle, who
shrunk again to the side of her friend.

"Are you serious in promising to go to this babyish fal-lal?" snapped
Josephine, the minute Mrs. Dana was gone.

"I am."

"Did not you hear that Anna Talbot is to receive company to-morrow
night?"

"Yes; and I am rejoiced that Elle's invitation was earliest. There are
Anna and Ellen Morris."

"I haven't time to stay," exclaimed the young lady, throwing herself
upon the sofa. "You both must spend a sociable evening with me--a
Christmas jubilee--egg-nogg, country-dances, etc. We are to have a high
time. You are disengaged?"

"I am," said Josephine, promptly, "and if I were not, I could not
resist the temptation to send a 'regret,' and go to your house."

"Thank you--and you, Ida--may I count upon you both?" drawing up her
cloak. Ida declined courteously;--"she was engaged to Mrs. Dana."

"Oh!" began Anna, disappointed.

"Is it not too silly!" interposed Josephine. "It is a child's party--a
molasses stew--think of it!"

"You are joking, Ida," said Ellen, "excuse yourself to Elle--we want
you!"

"Not as much as my little cousin does. I cannot break my word to her."

"Little cousin!" smiled Anna. "I thought the relationship was closer. I
will not give up the hope of persuading you. The nicest beaux in town
are to be there--Mr. Thornton, Mr. Russell, and Mr. Villet, and Mr.
Lacy, and a score more--do come!'"

"I cannot!" said Ida, with a pang.

"Papa will not be pleased with our going out separately;" said
Josephine, that night.

"He does not object to my going to Mr. Dana's alone;" was the response.

"Thinking of number one, as usual, my amiable lady! I tell you what! I
shall not demean myself, by playing puss-in-the-corner, and smearing my
hands with treacle, when I might be at Mr. Talbot's, in decent company."

"As you like. If you represent the character of the company to your
father, he will probably insist upon your mixing with them."

"He! he!" tittered Rachel, who was in waiting. Josephine flounced out
of the room.

"Christmas gift, Miss Ida!" Her maid stood at her bedside, in the
grey morning light. "Christmas gift!" called out the passers-by, as
they encountered each other in the street "Hurrah for Christmas!"
shouted squads of boys, at the corner, to a brilliant accompaniment of
pop-crackers.

Ida heard it all, with a spirit out of tune with mirth. No gifts were
prepared for her; the Thanksgiving-day was one of mourning to the
homeless. She had anticipated a visit from Carry, during the holidays;
but her last letter had dashed the hope. "Mammy" was recovering from
a severe fit of sickness, and she would not leave her. Ida wished she
were not to dine at Mr. Dana's; she was not fit for society, and sad
enough, without the sight of joys, which reminded her of her losses and
wants. In this discontented mood, she went down stairs. No Christmas
yet! Mr. Read grunted to her formal bow, and Josephine said "the coffee
was cold--it had been on the table so long." Mr. Read finished his
second cup, and pulled out his pocket-book.

"People will be asking if I made you a present. Thank goodness!
Christmas comes but once a year. Two would break a man. There!"
fillipping a roll of notes to his daughter. "Don't waste it upon
gimcracks and finery. If women had to earn money, they wouldn't be
so crazy to spend it. You must have some, I suppose:" and he laid a
smaller bundle upon Ida's plate.

"No, sir! I have money of my--" but he did not wait to hear her
through. As she quitted the table, Josephine pointed to the untouched
"present."

"Take it, if you choose!" said Ida, contemptuously. "I am not a
dependant or a beggar!"

Josephine loved money, and pocketed it. "And the old curmudgeon is none
the wiser!" chuckled the dutiful daughter.

Ida stretched herself upon a lounge, and set seriously about reasoning
herself out of her despondency. She thought of Carry, and Lynn and
Charley; but they came reluctantly, with selfishly happy faces; with
their schemes and amusements and dearer friends. Mr. and Mrs. Dana
pitied her;--this was the spring of their kindness! and her haughty
soul winced at the idea. Hope and Fancy crept, with trailing wings,
into hiding-places until the sun should shine out--she sullenly hugged
her misery. What visionary who reads this, but has suffered from these
morbose fits?

"Well?" said she, tartly, as Rachel tiptoed across the floor.

"I thought you was asleep;" replied the sable damsel.

"I am awake--do you want anything?"

Rachel rubbed her chin, gave her turban a twitch, and fumbled in her
pocket "Law! I ain't lost it, I know! It must be in my bosom!"

Ida, awakened by her movements, watched her as she produced a tiny
packet from the last-mentioned receptacle. With an odd compound of
awkwardness and affection, she slipped a ring upon her mistress' finger.

"Thar! it fits! don't it?" intensely complacent.

"But where did you get it, Rachel? is it for me?"

"For you, and nobody else, Miss Ida. I was determined your nose should
not be made a bridge of by everybody; so I've been a savin' my spare
coppers--(and no servant of yours wants for 'em,) and when you was
admirin' that ar ring of Miss Josephine's, I says to myself--'She shall
have one!' and when I'd cleaned up your room, I took off down town to
the jewellerers--and thar 'tis--wishin' you a Merry Christmas, and an
ever-lastin' Happy New Year, ma'am!" stepping back with a flourishing
courtesy. Ida tried to smile at her peroration, and failing, burst into
tears. Rachel was transfixed. She was not used to hysterics, and had
never seen her mistress weep before. Her consternation was a speedy
restorative; and Ida finally made her sensible that she was not grieved
or displeased, but overjoyed at her gift. Then the voluble Abigail
recollected "somethin' else" she had to communicate.

"Ain't that tall gentleman, with black whiskers, that visits here so
constant, named Mr. Lacy?"

"Yes."

"I thought so. When I went into the jewellerer's he was a standin'
at the counter, buyin' a pair of gold spectacles--for his mother--I
reckon. I heard him say they was for a lady. I asked for the rings, and
the shop-boy gave me a string of brassy, ugly things--and says I--'I
want a handsome one, sir, for my mistis.'

"'Your mistis!' says he. 'Them's plenty good for her!'

"'Are these the best you have?' says Mr. Lacy, sort o' frownin' and
talkin' like he was his master fifty times over.

"'No, sir--would you like to see some?' says the boy, turnin' white.

"'Bring them!' says Mr. Lacy; and when they come, he told me, with
the sweetest smile, and so respectful! 'These cost a great deal of
money--do you know it'?' So I showed him what I had, and he said
'twould do. Bimeby, I picked out two, and could not tell which was the
prettiest. I kept a-lookin' at one, and then at 'tother, and says he,
'Can't you choose between them?'

"'No, sir,' says I.

"'I think that the handsomest;' says he, pintin' to one, and that's
it you've got on your finger, this minute, Miss Ida. He seed that
low-lived boy give me the right change, and when I curchyed and said,
'I'm mightily obliged to you, sir;' he said, 'You are welcome,' just
like I'd been the Governor! We colored folks know a gentleman when we
see him, and he is a real born one."

The ring was very elegant, and the blood mounted to Ida's temple's, as
she toyed with it.

"Perhaps, it was not Mr. Lacy?" said she, in a tone of extreme
indifference. "Where had you met him, that you know him?"

"I never met him nowhar. I seed him one Sunday, when he walked
home with you from church, and I was at the up-stairs window, and
once through the dinin'-room door when he was here to supper, and
once--through the parlor window."

"Peeping! Rachel! If he had seen you, he would not think as highly of
your manners, as you do of his."

"Peeping! Law! Miss Ida, them was sly glimpses, permiscuous-like, you
know. He warn't a-gwine to catch me."

A longer inspection of the ring. There was no blush this time, but
the smile was happier. The motive was then as pure as the action was
generous. The little shower had purified the murky atmosphere. This
token of remembrance, at a moment when she believed herself forgotten,
was none the less dear that the donor was a poor slave. It was the
fruit of self-denying affection; and had no sooner clasped her finger,
than it acted as the Open Sesame to a store-house of untold riches. "It
has taught me more than one lesson," she murmured.

Rachel was garrulously happy.

"I do-clar, Miss Ida, you've been gettin' prettier ever since I come
in;" said she, standing off to survey the effect of her toilette. "I
hope thar'll be a crowd at Mars' John's. Is it a dinin'-day?"

"No--a family party."

"That's a pity! I 'spect that's another present! It never rains but it
pours."

The footman said Mr. Dana was below. Charley waited to escort her to
his brother's; and Ida began to realise, as he paid the compliments of
the season, in a style, eminently "Char-leyish,"--that Christmas had
indeed come.

"Christmas gift! Christmas gift! cousin Ida," shouted two infantine
voices; and Charley the less, and Elle scampered down the porch-steps
to salute her. "Now mamma! now for the tree! She is here!"

"Oh! Mrs. Dana! have not they seen their tree? What suspense for the
dear creatures!"

"It was their wish; and their father would not consent that the door
should be unlocked until the family were assembled."

"Here is the last straggler!" exclaimed Lynn, springing into the group,
shaking hands with his friends, and kissing the children. "We are all
here!"

At a given signal, the door of the mysterious room was unfolded, and
revealed the tree; its precious load glittering and gay in the clear
winter day. Headed by "papa," and closed by the nurse and baby, the
procession performed a circuit, and then formed a ring. Uncle Charley
was distributor; accompanying each gift by an appropriate remark. For
Ida, there were a pair of ear-rings from John Dana; a bracelet of
fair hair, which did not require the simple "Carry" upon the chased
clasp, to signify from whose brow it had been shorn; a handsomely-bound
edition of Shelly's works--Lynn's taste; Charley gave a card case, a
Chinese curiosity, and evaded her thanks and praises by pointing out a
resemblance in the most grotesque figure, carved thereupon, to himself,
a circumstance, which he protested, induced him to select it. Among the
white buds of a perpetual rose-tree, hung a card--"Elle and Charley to
their dear cousin;" and Mrs. Dana finished the list with a rose-wood
work-box, supplied with every implement of female industry.

"Is this being friendless?" asked Ida, inly, looking at her
acquisitions. "For the rest of the day, I will be grateful and
contented."

The morning was spent in the nursery. On Christmas day, its door could
not bar intruders; there were no men or women; all were children,
Charley whipped his namesake's top; rocked the cradle; and instructed
Elle in domestic economy, as he helped arrange her baby-house. The
dinner-bell, rung an hour earlier than usual, on account of the wee
ones taking that meal with the "big folks," was faintly heard in
the din of a famous game of romps. The afternoon was less noisy;
the children fell asleep, wearied with frolic; the gentlemen walked
out; Mrs. Dana was busy; and so it was, that Ida sat alone in the
drawing-room, at nightfall, watching the passing of the pink light from
the clouds, and thinking--"Everything to gladden me, and yet ill at
ease! murmuring soul, be still!" And then she wished for the society of
a calmer mind, that should speak peace to the heavings of her unquiet
spirit; for the comprehensive charity, the benign philosophy, which
hoped for the best, and argued for the right--this was her version of
the outgoing of the woman's heart--"Would he were here!"

But Elle's friends came early, and she had no time for higher thoughts
than filling small mouths with bread and butter--"run-the-thimble,"
the vexed question of "how many miles to Babylon;" and
"Chicken-me-chicken-me-craney-crow;" pastimes, whoso barbarous names
cause the refined juveniles of this precocious '54, to join their
gloved hands in thanksgiving, that their lot was not cast in those
times! As the dignified master of the house deigned to participate in
the ceremonies, we trust our heroine will not suffer a very grievous
letting-down in the opinion of these formidable critics, for the
prominent parts she assumed. A circle was ordered for "Fox and goose."
Charley played Reynard, and Ida, goose the first. The children enjoyed,
without fully understanding the game, and she had to keep the character
longer than the laws prescribed. Round and round they flew--circling
and doubling--the spectators screaming their applause--and she ran
directly against a gentlemen who was entering. Her impetus was such
that she would have fallen, but for his extended arm. A laughing voice
said something, unintelligible in her confusion.

"Oh! Mr. Lacy!" cried Elle. "I was so afraid you wouldn't come!"

"I promised--did I not?" said he, stooping to kiss her.

"Yes, sir, but I thought maybe you'd rather go to Miss Anna Talbot's
party, like Miss--"

"Elle! Elle! no, no!" whispered Ida, in time to suppress the name.

"You see I had rather be at yours;" he returned, without noticing the
unfinished sentence. "What are you playing?"

  "'Did you ever see a wild goose
  Sailing on the ocean?'"

sang Charley.

  "'The wild goose's motion
  Was a mighty funny notion.'"

he added, aside to Ida.

No forced spirits now! The innocent fun--the converse of the social
circle, after the little ones had gone--the walk home, beneath the
tremulous stars--the "good night" and pressure, whose thrill lingered
in her fingers 'till sleep sealed her eyes--all were sources of
unutterable pleasure--pleasures born from one influence--flowing from
one presence.

A month later, Josephine returned from an evening concert, with a
violent toothache, the consequence of the sudden transition from the
steaming hall to the ice-cold air without. She tossed and groaned in
agony through the night; by morning the pain abated, a relief for which
she was wickedly ungrateful, when she beheld reflected in the mirror, a
tumefaction of the cheek, nearly closing one eye, and otherwise marring
the symmetry of her features. The pain came back at intervals during
the day; and with fretfulness, threw her into a fever. Dr. Ballard was
sent for. It was late in the evening when she awoke from the slumber,
gained by the anodyne he administered. The rain was plashing against
the window; there was no other sound except a subdued murmur of distant
voices. There were visitors in the parlor--who had ventured through the
storm? Her sharpened senses caught manly tones--tones she thought she
recognised; and then Ida's rippling, joyous laugh smote her unwilling
ear. The conversation became lower and more serious; and she could
endure no more. Unmindful of health and prudence, she hurried on a
dressing-gown, wrapped a shawl about her head, and glided down stairs,
as stealthily as a cat. The front room only was warmed and lighted, but
the folding-doors were ajar. Mr. Lacy stood by the mantel, hat in hand,
yet in no hurry to depart. He was playing with a rosebud he had plucked
from a vase near, but as unconscious of its beauty as of the lateness
of the hour. The expression with which he regarded the earnest speaker
before him was not to be mistaken. It even seemed that he would have
it understood, for a proud smile trembled over his mouth, as her eye
avoided his.

Josephine felt turned to stone. By a singular fatality, she had, up
to this time, remained ignorant of the growing intimacy between these
two. We have seen that many of their interviews were unknown to her,
although some of them occurred in her very presence; and Ida, in
obedience to Lynn's caution, had guarded against any appearance of
rivalship. Now, jealousy and perception awoke together--at one sweeping
glance backward, she saw herself slighted--foiled--duped! and she grew
faint at the sight of the frightful results of her lack of vigilance,
which rushed overwhelmingly upon her mind. Her native shrewdness soon
came to her aid. Matters were not so desperate. There was no word of
love;--she breathed more freely. "Not yet! not yet!" she hissed, under
her breath;--and the small hands clenched in passionate resolve, as
she added--"never!" The leave-taking was full of feeling, but friends
parted as kindly. The outer door clanged to; and Ida sank into her
chair. Buried in the cushions, she sat, looking into the blaze, a smile
of ineffable tenderness illumining her face; her cheeks bright with
unwonted scarlet. The patter of the rain upon the panes but lulled her
into deeper reverie. And in contrast to a foreground so rich and warm,
in its glowing colors and balmy air, and dreams of love and hope--was
the dark, chill background, with its shape of evil, hideous in her
distorted features and glowering hatred. Ida stooped suddenly. It
was to pick up the bruised bud Morton had dropped. She looked around
hurriedly, and with a more vivid blush, raised it to her lips, and hid
it in her bosom.

"Rose-buds are not the only things which are played with for a time,
then trampled under foot, as you shall learn ere long, my love-lorn
damsel!" said the wily schemer, stealing back to her chamber.

"With us, now, it is war to the death!"




CHAPTER XV.


Nothing appeared less likely, at this period, than the fulfilment of
Lynn's prognostications of his destiny. He collected encouragement and
praise at every turn. A Bayard in society--a Raphael at the easel, he
bore a distinguished part in the lionization of the day. He sped well,
too, in his wooing. A quick fancy and impressible heart could hardly
resist the attractions of his person and genius; and the spice of
coquetry, generally predominant in Ellen's disposition, lay dormant,
as she hearkened to the voice of love. She made but one reservation
in pledging him her troth--that their engagement should be secret.
He would have had it proclaimed through the land--he so joyed in the
bliss he had won; but he bowed to the scarcely uttered wish, respecting
the maiden modesty that dictated the request. To Ida and Charley it
was divulged. He would not accept a happiness they wore forbidden to
share. For a few brief weeks this knew no shade or diminution; but a
change came. Ida discovered it; but he was silent, and she would not
extort confidence. It was a trial to see his clouded countenance and
fitful spirits; yet she knew his peculiarly sensitive organization, and
hoped the evil was magnified by its medium. In this hope she finally
persuaded him to speak.

They met at a Fancy Fair. Ida was in an embowered recess, Mr. Lacy for
a companion, and Charley hanging around to play propriety. Lynn entered
alone, and did not attach himself to any person or party. He marched
from end to end of the room, with folded arms, and a dogged look, too
foreign to him, not to impress one unpleasantly. He perceived Ida after
awhile, and acknowledged her presence by touching his hat, with no loss
of gloominess. Ida was distrait; even Mr. Lacy failed to charm; and
he was aware of it He guessed, too, from the direction of her eyes,
the working of her thoughts, and proposed a visit to the refreshment
table, which stood in the path of the promenaders. Lynn could not brush
by without speaking. The first tone of Ida's voice affected him. The
dull black of his eyes became lustrous, and the long lashes fell over
them to conceal the momentary weakness. She would not let him go. She
asked him questions without number or meaning, not waiting for answers,
until she had eaten her ice; when she gave her glass to Mr. Lacy, and
with an apology, his eye said was unnecessary, took Lynn's arm. He
confessed all, as she had determined he should. It was a common tale;
the scrupulousness of a love, made up of delicacy and truth, and the
thoughtless trifling of a girl who felt her power;--so she explained
it, but the young lover mourned the death of his first-born hope.

"I would as soon speak lightly of my dead sister, as tamper with her
affection," said he. "Your excuse that she does these things to try
mine--if you are right--proves that she never loved me."

"But why did I say she applied the test? In girlish caprice--foolish
enough--but harmless as to intention. Have you forgotten what women are
in their 'hour of ease?' if danger or sorrow menaced you, she would
stand by you to the last. She loves you, Lynn,--I am assured of this."

"Not so am I. I called there this evening. She had promised to
accompany me hither, but she was 'engaged with company!' Those
addlepates, Pemberton and Talbot were there, doling out their senseless
prattle; and she was gracious to them, repellant to me. If Pemberton
were not a puppy, I would not sleep before I crossed swords with him.
She waltzed with him last night. I had told her that I would not
invite any lady, whom I respected, to engage in that most disgusting
of dances. Conceive of my feelings, when, within the hour, I saw her
whirling down the hall in his arms! And the coxcomb's insufferable
impudence! if he thwarts me again, I will cane him!"

"You will not! Go and see Ellen to-morrow, when there is no one
to annoy you, by preventing a private interview. Set before her the
unkindness, the want of generosity apparent in her conduct; assert your
rights with dignity, and your resolution to uphold them."

"I would not pain her, Ida. She has chosen the easiest method of
undeceiving me; better this, than a life-time of misery to both. She
said, the other day, to a gentle reproach for an open slight, which
would have offended a vainer man, mortally, that she did it to mislead
others. 'A young lady,' she remarked, 'sinks into a cypher, if it is
suspected that she is betrothed. I have not had my lawful amount of
admiration yet.'

"'Ellen!' said I, 'I have loved you as man never loved woman before;
have believed you pure and high-minded. If I thought that the
despicable coquetry you insinuate, caused you to insist upon the
concealment of our engagement, I would trumpet it to the world, and
then break it myself!'"

"Lynn, remember where you are! You are too harsh; it was a jest."

"The manner displeased me most, and to-night, when I saw those
fops--could I be patient?"

Their conversation and saunter were prolonged.

"Are you going home to-night?" asked Josephine, gaily, hailing them in
one of their rounds. "They are extinguishing the lamps."

Ida changed color as she saw that she had Mr. Lacy's arm. Lynn observed
it, and waited for her.

"You are fast walkers--go on," said Josephine, at the door. As they
passed, Ida had a view of Mr. Lacy's features. They were so pale and
rigid, that she started. He answered her look of apprehension with one
that froze her blood.

What had she done to draw down that stern, yet sorrowful rebuke?

          "The look you wear
  A heart may heal or break."

Her pillow was damp that night.

Mr. Thornton had obtained a signal victory in his first important
cause. Already, his legal acumen and oratorical powers marked him in
the public eye for usefulness and fame; and on the evening after the
delivery of the verdict, he called together a band of select spirits to
rejoice with him. The banquet was well ordered; comprising the rarities
of the season, and a variety of wines, varied by the introduction
of agreeable non-intoxicants, coffee, tea, iced sherbet, etc. These
unwonted accompaniments of a bachelor supper were looked upon with an
evil eye by some of the guests. They were jealous of innovations which
might end in puritanical abstinence; and their fears were further
excited that three of their small number preferred the less stimulating
beverages. That Mr. Lacy's example should be copied by Mr. Compton, a
fellow-student, was not surprising, as they were intimate, and known
as members of the same church; but at Charles Dana's rejection of the
social glass, there was a hum of exclamations and inquiries, which was
calmed by his imperturbability, and the polite tact of the host. Morton
could not unriddle the conduct of his friend, for he knew that his most
trivial action was not meaningless. "Not a convert, Charley?" he said,
when the rest were in full cry after some inspiring subject.

"Unfortunately, no. It is from a motive of expediency that I abstain
to-night."

They sat together, and as he spoke, Mr. Lacy chanced to remark Lynn,
who was opposite. He drank deeply, but his potations had not had time
to ignite the fire that burned in his eyes and checks. His talk was
a volcanic eloquence, reckless as to course and consequence; and his
laugh had the peal of a maniac's yell. In real alarm, Morton turned to
his neighbor. Charley was on the alert; not outwardly--he might have
been more grave and taciturn than common, but there were no evidences
of anxiety. Morton divined his feelings, by a glance he saw exchanged
between him and his heated friend; a look of warning and appeal on one
side,--of anguish, scornful in its bitterness, on the other,--and the
torrent rolled on as before.

During the giving of toasts, Mr. Lacy and Charley fell into a quiet
chat, only pausing to lift their glasses in courtesy to the authors,
ignorant, most of the time, of the sentiment proposed. Lynn was more
sedate; from delirium he was relapsing into a comatose state, when he
was brought to his feet by a toast to his art, coupled with a neatly
turned compliment to himself, from Mr. Thornton. His unpremeditated
reply was beautiful and touching. He was under the very spur of genius;
rich metaphors, apt classical allusions, and delicate pathos poured
from his lips, as thoughts from his brain; his rapt hearers scarcely
conscious that he employed the machinery of words. The applause that
succeeded the last musical echo was deafening. For a moment, the wild
glare that had distressed Morton, disappeared, and with a happy,
grateful smile, he bowed his thanks for this spontaneous tribute of
approbation and regard.

"Egad!" said Pemberton, "you have mistaken your calling, Holmes--you
had better burn up your canvass, and take to stump-speaking, you'd make
more money by it."

Angry frowns and rebuking eyes were directed to the drunken speaker.

"If stumps and blockheads claim kindred, I shall not need to go far to
exercise my vocation," said Lynn, hotly.

"Ha! ha!" laughed the other, with a violent affectation of derision.

"Don't be frightened, gentlemen! Mr. Holmes and myself have wrestled
upon another battle-field, and I can afford to forgive him, from the
soreness of his defeat. Your friend and instructress, that loud-tongued
virago, Ida Ross, could not have uttered--"

Like a wounded panther, Lynn cleared the table at a bound, and grasped
his throat. A general rush was made to the spot, and they were parted
before either sustained serious injury. Pemberton had drawn a dirk at
the attack, but it was wrested from him by Mr. Lacy. Reconciliation was
impossible in the excited state of the combatants. Charley prudently
withdrew his friend, relying upon time and reflection to prepare the
mind of each for overtures and concessions. Lynn did not speak until
they reached his room; then, extricating his arm from Charley's hold,
he demanded in a high tone, what had been his object in terminating the
conflict. "If not finished there, you know it must be somewhere."

"I do not see the necessity," was the reply. "It is a drunken broil, of
which you will be ashamed to-morrow. No man in his senses would have
noticed him as you did. He shall have a cow-hiding for his last speech;
I would not disgrace a more honorable weapon by using it against him. I
am mortified, Lynn--I hoped you were learning to control those childish
fits of passion."

"Am I to be crossed and bullied forever by a meddling fool? Is it not
enough that he has helped to wreck my peace, but he must taunt me with
it?" cried Lynn passionately. "He ought not to live, and I do not care
to!"

"You certainly are not fit to die." said Charley composedly, "or you
would not rave so like a madman. Be sane for five minutes; by what
means has your happiness been put in his power?"

Lynn was a humored, wayward child, and this cold severity did more to
quiet him than an hour's rhetorical pleading. Charley listened with
knitting brows, to a rehearsal of his story to Ida, and an account of
that day's interview with Ellen. She was dressed for a ride with Mr.
