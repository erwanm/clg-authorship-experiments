of the town, and even of the State. Each speculative merchant who went
forth, with or without a cargo (and the trade in ice was then only
beginning), in his own ship, with his wife and her babes, was determined
to bring home some offering to the Museum, if he should accomplish a
membership of that institution by doubling either Cape Horn or the Cape
of Good Hope. He picked up an old cargo somewhere and trafficked with
it for another; and so he went on--if not rounding the world, seeing
no small part of it, and making acquaintance with a dozen eccentric
potentates and barbaric chiefs, and sovereigns with widely celebrated
names; and, whether the adventurer came home rich or poor, he was sure
to have gained much knowledge, and to have become very entertaining
in discourse. The houses of the principal merchants were pleasant
abodes--each standing alone beside the street, which was an avenue
thick-strewn with leaves in autumn and well shaded in summer. Not far
away were the woods, where lumbering went on, for the export of timber
to Charleston and New Orleans, and for the furniture manufacture, which
was the main industry of the less fertile districts of Massachusetts in
those days. Here and there was a little lake--a "pond"--under the shadow
of the woods, yielding water-lilies in summer, and ice for exportation
in winter--as soon as that happy idea had occurred to some fortunate
speculator. On some knoll there was sure to be a school-house. Amid
these and many other pleasant objects, and in the very center of the
stranger's observations, there was one spectacle that had no beauty in
it--just as in the happy course of the life of the Salem community there
is one fearful period. That dreary object is the Witches' Hill at Salem;
and that fearful chapter of history is the tragedy of the Witch
Delusion.


HOW THE SUBJECT WAS OPENED.

Our reason for selecting the date of thirty-seven years ago for our
glance at the Salem of the last generation is, that at that time a
clergyman resident there fixed the attention of the inhabitants on the
history of their forefathers by delivering lectures on Witchcraft. This
gentleman was then a young man, of cultivated mind and intellectual
tastes, a popular preacher, and esteemed and beloved in private life. In
delivering those lectures he had no more idea than his audience that he
was entering upon the great work and grand intellectual interest of
his life. When he concluded the course, he was unconscious of having
offered more than the entertainment of a day; yet the engrossing
occupation of seven-and-thirty years for himself, and no little
employment and interest for others, have grown out of that early effort.
He was requested to print the lectures, and did so. They went through
more than one edition; and every time he reverted to the subject,
with some fresh knowledge gathered from new sources, he perceived
more distinctly how inadequate, and even mistaken, had been his early
conceptions of the character of the transactions which constituted
the Witch Tragedy. At length he refused to reissue the volume. "I was
unwilling," he says in the preface of the book before us, "to issue
again what I had discovered to be an insufficient presentation of the
subject." Meantime, he was penetrating into mines of materials for
history, furnished by the peculiar forms of administration instituted by
the early rulers of the province. It was an ordinance of the General
Court of Massachusetts, for instance, that testimony should in all cases
be taken in the shape of depositions, to be preserved "in perpetual
remembrance." In all trials, the evidence of witnesses was taken in
writing beforehand, the witnesses being present (except in certain
cases) to meet any examination in regard to their recorded testimony.
These depositions were carefully preserved, in complete order: and
thus we may now know as much about the landed property, the wills, the
contracts, the assaults and defamation, the thievery and cheating, and
even the personal morals and social demeanor of the citizens of Salem
of two centuries and a half ago as we could have done if they had
had law-reporters in their courts, and had filed those reports, and
preserved the police departments of newspapers like those of the present
day. The documents relating to the witchcraft proceedings have been
for the most part laid up among the State archives; but a considerable
number of them have been dispersed--no doubt from their connection with
family history, and under impulses of shame and remorse. Of these, some
are safely lodged in literary institutions, and others are in private
hands, though too many have been lost.


CAREFUL HISTORIOGRAPHY.

In a long course of years, Mr. Upham, and after him his sons, have
searched out all documents they could hear of. When they had reason to
believe that any transcription of papers was inaccurate--that gaps had
been conjecturally filled up, that dates had been mistaken, or that
papers had been transposed, they never rested till they had got hold of
the originals, thinking the bad spelling, the rude grammar, and strange
dialect of the least cultivated country people less objectionable than
the unauthorized amendments of transcribers. Mr. Upham says he has
resorted to the originals throughout. Then there were the parish books
and church records, to which was committed in early days very much
in the life of individuals which would now be considered a matter of
private concern, and scarcely fit for comment by next-door neighbors.
The primitive local maps and the coast-survey chart, with the markings
of original grants to settlers, and of bridges, mills, meeting-houses,
private dwellings, forest roads, and farm boundaries, have been
preserved. Between these and deeds of conveyance it has been possible to
construct a map of the district, which not only restores the external
scene to the mind's eye, but casts a strong and fearful light--as we
shall see presently--on the origin and course of the troubles of 1692.
Mr. Upham and his sons have minutely examined the territory--tracing the
old stone walls and the streams, fixing the gates, measuring distances,
even verifying points of view, till the surrounding scenery has become
as complete as could be desired. Between the church books and the parish
and court records, the character, repute, ways, and manners of every
conspicuous resident can be ascertained; and it may be said that nothing
out of the common way happened to any man, woman, or child within the
district which could remain unknown at this day, if any one wished to
make it out. Mr. Upham has wished to make out the real story of the
Witch Tragedy; and he has done it in such a way that his readers will
doubtless agree that no more accurate piece of history has ever been
written than the annals of this New England township.

For such a work, however, something more is required than the most
minute delineation of the outward conditions of men and society; and in
this higher department of his task Mr. Upham is above all anxious to
obtain and dispense true light. The second part of his work treats of
what may be called the spiritual scenery of the time. He exhibits the
superstition of that age, when the belief in Satanic agency was the
governing idea of religious life, and the most engrossing and pervading
interest known to the Puritans of every country. Of the young and
ignorant in the new settlement beyond the seas his researches have led
him to write thus:


THE ACTORS IN THE TRAGEDY.

"However strange it seems, it is quite worthy of observation, that the
actors in that tragedy, the 'afflicted children,' and other witnesses,
in their various statements and operations, embraced about the whole
circle of popular superstition. How those young country girls, some of
them mere children, most of them wholly illiterate, could have become
familiar with such fancies, to such an extent, is truly surprising. They
acted out, and brought to bear with tremendous effect, almost all that
can be found in the literature of that day, and the period preceding it,
relating to such subjects. Images and visions which had been portrayed
in tales of romance, and given interest to the pages of poetry, will
be made by them, as we shall see, to throng the woods, flit through
the air, and hover over the heads of a terrified court. The ghosts of
murdered wives and children will play their parts with a vividness
of representation and artistic skill of expression that have hardly
been surpassed in scenic representations on the stage. In the
Salem-witchcraft proceedings, the superstition of the middle ages
was embodied in real action. All its extravagant absurdities and
monstrosities appear in their application to human experience. We see
what the effect has been, and must be, when the affairs of life, in
courts of law and the relations of society, or the conduct or feelings
of individuals, are suffered to be under the control of fanciful or
mystical notions. When a whole people abandons the solid ground of
common sense, overleaps the boundaries of human knowledge, gives itself
up to wild reveries, and lets loose its passions without restraint,
it presents a spectacle more terrific to behold, and becomes more
destructive and disastrous, than any convulsion of mere material
nature,--than tornado, conflagration, or earthquake." (Vol. i. p. 468.)


PHILOSOPHY OF THE DELUSION.

All this is no more than might have occurred to a thoughtful historian
long years ago; but there is yet something else which it has been
reserved for our generation to perceive, or at least to declare, without
fear or hesitation. Mr. Upham may mean more than some people would in
what he says of the new opening made by science into the dark depths
of mystery covered by the term Witchcraft; for he is not only the
brother-in-law but the intimate friend and associate of Dr. Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard
University, and still better known to us, as he is at home, as the
writer of the physiological tales, "Elsie Venner" and the "Guardian
Angel," which have impressed the public as something new in the
literature of fiction. It can not be supposed that Mr. Upham's view of
the Salem Delusion would have been precisely what we find it here if
he and Dr. Holmes had never met; and, but for the presence of the
Professor's mind throughout the book, which is most fitly dedicated to
him, its readers might have perceived less clearly the true direction in
which to look for a solution of the mystery of the story, and its writer
might have written something less significant in the place of the
following paragraph:

"As showing how far the beliefs of the understanding, the perceptions of
the senses, and the delusions of the imagination may be confounded, the
subject belongs not only to theology and moral and political science,
but to physiology, in its original and proper use, as embracing our
whole nature; and the facts presented may help to conclusions relating
to what is justly regarded as the great mystery of our being--the
connection between the body and the mind." (Vol. i. p. viii.)


CHARACTER OF THE EARLY SETTLEMENT.

The settlement had its birth in 1620, the date of the charter granted
by James I. to "the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New
England." The first policy of the company was to attract families of
good birth, position, education, and fortune, to take up considerable
portions of land, introduce the best agriculture known, and facilitate
the settling of the country. Hence the tone of manners, the social
organization, and the prevalence of the military spirit, which the
subsequent decline in the spirit of the community made it difficult for
careless thinkers to understand. Not only did the wealth of this class
of early settlers supply the district with roads and bridges, and clear
the forest; it set up the pursuit of agriculture in the highest place,
and encouraged intellectual pursuits, refined intercourse, and a loftier
spirit of colonizing enterprise than can be looked for among immigrants
whose energies are engrossed by the needs of the day. The mode of dress
of the gentry of this class shows us something of their aspect in their
new country, when prowling Indians were infesting the woods a stone's
throw from their fences, and when the rulers of the community took it
in turn with all their neighbors to act as scouts against the savages.
George Corwin was thus dressed:

"A wrought flowing neckcloth, a sash covered with lace, a coat with
short cuffs and reaching halfway between the wrist and elbow; the skirts
in plaits below; an octagon ring and cane. The last two articles are
still preserved. His inventory mentions 'a silver-laced cloth coat, a
velvet ditto, a satin waistcoat embroidered with gold, a trooping scarf
and silver hat-band, golden-topped and embroidered, and a silver-headed
cane.'" (Vol. i. p. 98.)

This aristocratic element was in large proportion to the total number
of settlers. It lifted up the next class to a position inferior only
to its own by its connection with land. The farmers formed an order by
themselves--not by having peculiar institutions, but through the dignity
ascribed to agriculture. The yeomanry of Massachusetts hold their heads
high to this day, and their fathers spoke proudly of themselves as "the
farmers." They penetrated the forest in all directions, sat down beside
the streams, and plowed up such level tracts as they found open to
the sunshine; so that in a few years "the Salem Farms" constituted a
well-defined territory, thinly peopled, but entirely appropriated. In
due course parishes were formed round the outskirts of "Salem Farms,"
encroaching more or less in all directions, and reducing the area to
that which was ultimately known as "Salem Village," in which some few
of the original grants of five hundred acres or less remained complete,
while others were divided among families or sold. Long before the date
of the Salem Tragedy, the strifes which follow upon the acquisition of
land had become common, and there was much ill-blood within the bounds
of the City of Peace. The independence, the mode of life, and the pride
of the yeomen made them excellent citizens, however, when war broke out
with the Indians or with any other foe; and the military spirit of the
aristocracy was well sustained by that of the farmers.

The dignity of the town had been early secured by the wisdom of the
Company at home, which had committed to the people the government of the
district in which they were placed; and every citizen felt himself, in
his degree, concerned in the rule and good order of the society in which
he lived; but the holders of land recognized no real equality between
themselves and men of other callings, while the artisans and laborers
were ambitious to obtain a place in the higher class. Artisans of every
calling needed in a new society had been sent out from England by the
Company; and when all the most energetic had acquired as much land as
could be had in recompense for special services to the community--as so
many acres for plowing up a meadow, so many for discovering minerals, so
many for foiling an Indian raid,--and when the original grants had been
broken up, and finally parceled out among sons and daughters, leaving
no scope for new purchasers, the most ambitious of the adventurers
applied for tracts in Maine, where they might play their part of First
Families in a new settlement. The weaker, the more envious, the more
ill-conditioned thus remained behind, to cavil at their prosperous
neighbors, and spite them if they could. Here was an evident preparation
for social disturbance, when opportunity for gratifying bad passions
should arise.


FIRST CAUSES.

There had been a preparation for this stage in the temper with which the
adventurers had arrived in the country, and the influences which at once
operated upon them there. The politics and the religion in which they
had grown up were gloomy and severe. Those who were not soured were sad;
and, it should be remembered, they fully believed that Satan and his
powers were abroad, and must be contended with daily and hourly, and in
every transaction of life. In their new home they found little cheer
from the sun and the common daylight; for the forest shrouded the entire
land beyond the barren seashore. The special enemy, the Red Indian,
always watching them and seeking his advantage of them, was not, in
their view, a simple savage. Their clergy assured them that the Red
Indians were worshipers and agents of Satan; and it is difficult to
estimate the effect of this belief on the minds and tempers of those
who were thinking of the Indians at every turn of daily life. The
passion which is in the far West still spoken of as special, under the
name of "Indian-hating," is a mingled ferocity and fanaticism quite
inconceivable by quiet Christians, or perhaps by any but border
adventurers; and this passion, kindled by the first demonstration of
hostility on the part of the Massachusetts Red Man, grew and spread
incessantly under the painful early experiences of colonial life. Every
man had in turn to be scout, by day and night, in the swamp and in the
forest; and every woman had to be on the watch in her husband's absence
to save her babes from murderers and kidnappers. Whatever else they
might want to be doing, even to supply their commonest needs, the
citizens had first to station themselves within hail of each other all
day, and at night to drive in their cattle among the dwellings, and keep
watch by turns. Even on Sundays patrols were appointed to look to the
public safety while the community were at church. The mothers carried
their babes to the meeting-house, rather than venture to stay at home in
the absence of husband and neighbors. One function of the Sabbath patrol
indicates to us other sources of trouble. While looking for Indians,
the patrol was to observe who was absent from worship, to mark what the
absentees were doing, and to give information to the authorities. These
patrols were chosen from the leading men of the community--the most
active, vigilant, and sensible--and it is conceivable that much
ill-will might have been accumulated in the hearts of not only the
ne'er-do-weels, but timid and jealous and angry persons who were uneasy
under this Sabbath inspection. Such ill-will had its day of triumph when
the Salem Tragedy arrived at its catastrophe.


DEATH OF THE PATRIARCH.

The ordinary experience of life was singularly accelerated in that new
state of society, though in the one particular of the age attained by
the primitive adventurers, the community may be regarded as favored.
Death made a great sweep of the patriarchs at last--shortly before
the Tragedy--but an unusual proportion of elders presided over social
affairs for seventy years after the date of the second charter. The
chief seats in the meeting-house were filled by gray-haired men and
women, rich or poor as might happen; and they were allowed to retain
their places, whoever else might be shifted in the yearly "seating."
The title "Landlord" distinguished the most dignified, and the eldest
of each family of the "Old Planters;" a "Goodman" and "Goodwife"
(abbreviated to "Goody") were titles of honor, as signifying heads
of households. The old age of these venerable persons was carefully
cherished; and when, as could not but happen, many of them departed
near together, the mourning of the community was deep and bitter.
Society seemed to be deprived of its parents, and in fear and grief
it anticipated the impending calamity. Except in regard to these
patriarchs, and their long old age, the pace of events was very rapid.
Early marriages might be looked for in a society so youthful; but the
rapid succession of second and subsequent marriages is a striking
feature in the register. The most devoted affection seems to have had
no effect in deferring a second marriage so long as a year. No time
was lost in settling in life at first; families were large; and
half-brothers and sisters abounded; and as they grew up they married on
the portions which were given them, as a matter of course,--each having
house, land, and plenishing, until at last the parents gave away all but
a sufficiency for their own need or convenience, and went into the town
or remained in the central mansion, turning over the land and its cares
to the younger generation. When there was a failure of offspring, the
practice of adoption seems to have been resorted to almost as a natural
process, which, in such a state of society, it probably was.


GROWTH.

In the early days of the arts of life it is usual for the separate
transactions of each day to be slow and cumbrous; but the experience of
life may be rapid nevertheless. While traveling was a rough jog-trot,
and forest-land took years to clear, and the harvest weeks to gather,
property grew fast, marriages were precipitate and repeated, one
generation trod on the heels of another, and the old folks complained
that The Enemy made rapid conquest of the new territory which they
had hoped he could not enter. When any work--of house-building, or
harvesting, or nutting, or furnishing, or raising the wood-pile--had to
be done, it was secured by assembling all the hands in the neighborhood,
and turning the toil into a festive pleasure. We have all read of such
"bees" in the rural districts of America down to the present day; and we
can easily understand how the "goodmen" and "goodies" watched for the
good and the evil which came out of such celebrations--the courtship and
marriage, and the neighborly interest and good offices on the one
hand, and the evil passions from disappointed hopes, envy, jealousy,
tittle-tattle, rash judgment, and slander on the other. Much that was
said, done, and inferred in such meetings as these found its way long
afterward into the Tragedy at Salem. Mr. Upham depicts the inner side of
the young social life of which the inquisitorial meeting-house and the
courts were the black shadow:

"The people of the early colonial settlements had a private and interior
life, as much as we have now, and the people of all ages and countries
have had. It is common to regard them in no other light than as a
severe, somber, and pleasure-abhorring generation. It was not so with
them altogether. They had the same nature that we have. It was not all
gloom and severity. They had their recreations, amusements, gayeties,
and frolics. Youth was as buoyant with hope and gladness, love as warm
and tender, mirth as natural to innocence, wit as sprightly, then as
now. There was as much poetry and romance; the merry laugh enlivened
the newly opened fields, and rang through the bordering woods as loud,
jocund, and unrestrained as in these older and more crowded settlements.
It is true that their theology was austere, and their policy, in Church
and State, stern; but, in their modes of life, there were some features
which gave peculiar opportunity to exercise and gratify a love of social
excitement of a pleasurable kind." (Vol. i. p. 200.)

Except such conflicts as arose about the boundaries of estates when the
General Court was remiss in making and enforcing its decisions, the
first and greatest strifes related to Church matters and theological
doctrines. The farmers had more lively minds, better informed as to law,
and more exercised in reasoning and judging than their class are usually
supposed to have; for there never was a time when lawsuits were not
going forward about the area and the rights of some landed property
or other; and intelligent men were called on to follow the course of
litigation, if not to serve the community in office. Thus they were
prepared for the strife when the operation of the two Churches pressed
for settlement.


TROUBLE IN THE CHURCH.

The farmers in the rural district thenceforward to be called "Salem
Village," desired to have a meeting-house and a minister of their own;
but the town authorities insisted on taxing them for the religious
establishment in Salem, from which they derived no benefit. In 1670,
twenty of them petitioned to be set off as a parish, and allowed to
provide a minister for themselves. In two years more the petition
was granted, as a compromise for larger privileges; but there were
restrictions which spoiled the grace of such concession as there was.
One of these restrictions was that no minister was to be permanently
settled without the permission of the old Church to proceed to his
ordination. Endless trouble arose out of this provision. The men who
had contributed the land, labor, and material for the meeting-house,
and the maintenance for the pastor, naturally desired to be free in
their choice of their minister, while the Church authorities in Salem
considered themselves responsible for the maintenance of true doctrine,
and for leaving no opening for Satan to enter the fold in the form of
heresy, or any kind or degree of dissent. Their fathers, the first
settlers, had made the colony too hot for one of their most virtuous
and distinguished citizens, because he had views of his own on Infant
Baptism; they had brought him to judgment, magistrate and church member
as he was, for not having presented his infant child at the font; he had
sold his estates and gone away. If such a citizen as Townsend Bishop
was thus lost to their society, how could the guardians of religion
surrender their control over any church or pastor within their reach?
They had spiritual charge of a community which had made its abode on the
American shore for the single purpose of living its own religious life
in its own way; and no dissent or modification from within could be
permitted, any more than intrusion or molestation from without. Between
the ecclesiastical view on the one hand, and the civil view on the
other, there was small chance of harmony between town and village, or
between pastor, flock, and the overseers of both. The great point on
which they were all agreed was that they were all in special danger from
the extreme malice of Satan, who, foiled in Puritan England, was bent
on revenge in America, and was visibly and audibly present in the
settlement, seeking whom he might devour.

Quarreling began with the appearance of the first minister, a young Mr.
Bayley, who was appointed from year to year, but never ordained the
pastor till 1679, when the authorities of Salem tried to force him
upon the people of Salem Village in the face of strong opposition. The
farmers disregarded the orders issued from the town, and managed their
religious affairs by general meetings of their own congregation; and at
length Mr. Bayley retired, leaving the society in a much worse temper
than he had found on his arrival. A handsome gift of land was settled
upon him, in acknowledgment of his services; he quitted the ministry,
and practiced medicine in Roxbury till his death, nearly thirty years
afterward.


REV. MR. BURROUGHS.

His partisans were enemies of his successor, of course. Mr. Burroughs
was a man of even distinguished excellence in the pastoral relation, in
days when risks from Indians made that duty as perilous as the career
of the soldier in war time; but his flock were divided, church business
was neglected, he was allowed to fall into want. He withdrew, was
recalled to settle accounts, was arrested for debt in full meeting--the
debt being for the funeral expenses of his wife--was absolved from all
blame under the cruel neglect he had experienced--and left the Village.
Before he could hear in his remote home in Maine what was doing at
Salem in the first days of the Witch Tragedy, he was summoned to his
old neighborhood, was charged with sorcery on the most childish and
absurd testimony conceivable, and executed in August, 1692. One of the
witnesses--a young girl morbid in body and mind--poured out her remorse
to him the day before his death. He, believing her a victim of Satan,
forgave her, prayed with her, and died honored and beloved by all who
were not under the curse of the bigotry of the time.


DEODAT LAWSON.

The third minister was one Deodat Lawson, who is notable--besides his
learning--for his Sermon on the Devil, and for some mournful mystery
about his end. Of his last days there is nothing known but that
there was something woeful in them; but his sermon, preached at the
commencement of the outbreak in Salem, remains to us. It was published
in America, and then widely circulated in England. It met the popular
craving for light about Satan and his doings; and thus, between its
appropriateness to the time and occasion, and the learning and ability
which it manifested, it produced an extraordinary effect in its day. In
ours it is an instructive evidence of the extent to which "knowledge
falsely so called" may operate on the mind of society, in the absence of
science, and before the time has arrived for a clear understanding of
the nature of knowledge and the conditions of its attainment. Mr. Lawson
bore a part in the Salem Tragedy, and then went to England, where we
hear of him from Calamy as "the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson," and he
disappears.


PARRIS--A MALIGNANT.

The fourth and last of the ministers of Salem Village, before the
Tragedy, was the Mr. Parris who played the most conspicuous part in it.
He must have been a man of singular shamelessness, as well as remarkable
selfishness, craft, ruthlessness, and withal imprudence. He began his
operations with sharp bargaining about his stipend, and sharp practice
in appropriating the house and land assigned for the use of successive
pastors. He wrought diligently under the stimulus of his ambition till
he got his meeting-house sanctioned as a true church, and himself
ordained as the first pastor of Salem Village. This was in 1689. He
immediately launched out into such an exercise of priestly power as
could hardly be exceeded under any form of church government; he set
his people by the ears on every possible occasion and on every possible
pretense; he made his church a scandal in the land for its brawls and
controversies; and on him rests the responsibility of the disease and
madness which presently turned his parish into a hell, and made it
famous for the murder of the wisest, gentlest, and purest Christians
it contained. [This man Parris must have had an inferior intellect,
small Conscientiousness, Benevolence, and Veneration; large Firmness,
Self-Esteem, Combativeness, Destructiveness, and Acquisitiveness.]


A PROTEAN DEVIL.

Before we look at his next proceeding, however, we must bring into view
one or two facts essential to the understanding of the case. We have
already observed on the universality of the belief in the ever-present
agency of Satan in that region and that special season. In the woods the
Red Men were his agents--living in and for his service and his worship.
In the open country, Satan himself was seen, as a black horse, a black
dog, as a tall, dark stranger, as a raven, a wolf, a cat, etc. Strange
incidents happened there as everywhere--odd bodily affections and mental
movements; and when devilish influences are watched for, they are sure
to be seen. Everybody was prepared for manifestations of witchcraft from
the first landing in the Bay; and there had been more and more cases,
not only rumored, but brought under investigation, for some years before
the final outbreak.

This suggests the next consideration: that the generation concerned
had no "alternative" explanation within their reach, when perplexed by
unusual appearances or actions of body or mind. They believed themselves
perfectly certain about the Devil and his doings; and his agency was the
only solution of their difficulties, while it was a very complete one.
They thought they knew that his method of working was by human agents,
whom he had won over and bound to his service. They had all been brought
up to believe this; and they never thought of doubting it.


STATE OF PHYSIOLOGY.

The very conception of science had then scarcely begun to be formed in
the minds of the wisest men of the time; and if it had been, who was
there to suggest that the handful of pulp contained in the human skull,
and the soft string of marrow in the spine, and cobweb lines of nerves,
apparently of no more account than the hairs of the head, could transmit
thoughts, emotions, passions--all the scenery of the spiritual world!
For two hundred years more there was no effectual recognition of
anything of the sort. At the end of those two centuries anatomists
themselves were slicing the brain like a turnip, to see what was inside
it,--not dreaming of the leading facts of its structure, nor of the
inconceivable delicacy of its organization. After half a century of
knowledge of the main truth in regard to the brain, and nearly that
period of study of its organization, by every established medical
authority in the civilized world, we are still perplexed and baffled
at every turn of the inquiry into the relations of body and mind. How,
then, can we make sufficient allowance for the effects of ignorance in
a community where theology was the main interest in life, where science
was yet unborn, and where all the influences of the period concurred
to produce and aggravate superstitions and bigotries which now seem
scarcely credible?

[The reviewer appears to be a half believer in Phrenology, and yet
unwilling to acknowledge his indebtedness to its teachers for the light
he has received in the organization and phenomena of the brain.]


WILLIAM PENN AS A PRECEDENT.

There had been misery enough caused by persecutions for witchcraft
within living memory to have warned Mr. Parris, one would think, how he
carried down his people into those troubled waters again; but at that
time such trials were regarded by society as trials for murder are by
us, and not as anything surprising except from the degree of wickedness.
William Penn presided at the trial of two Swedish women in Philadelphia
for this gravest of crimes; and it was only by the accident of a legal
informality that they escaped, the case being regarded with about the
same feeling as we experienced a year or two ago when the murderess of
infants, Charlotte Winsor, was saved from hanging by a doubt of the law.
If the crime spread--as it usually did--the municipal governments issued
an order for a day of fasting and humiliation, "in consideration of the
extent to which Satan prevails amongst us in respect of witchcraft."
Among the prosecutions which followed on such observances there was one
here and there which turned out, too late, to have been a mistake.
This kind of discovery might be made an occasion for more fasting and
humiliation; but it seems to have had no effect in inducing caution or
suggesting self-distrust. Mr. Parris and his partisans must have been
aware that on occasion of the last great spread of witchcraft, the
magistrates and the General Court had set aside the verdict of the jury
in one case of wrongful accusation, and that there were other instances
in which the general heart and conscience were cruelly wounded and
oppressed, under the conviction that the wisest and saintliest woman in
the community had been made away with by malice, at least as much as
mistaken zeal.

The wife of one of the most honored and prominent citizens of Boston,
and the sister of the Deputy Governor of Massachusetts, Mrs. Hibbins,
might have been supposed safe from the gallows, while she walked in
uprightness, and all holiness and gentleness of living. But her husband
died; and the pack of fanatics sprang upon her, and tore her to
pieces--name and fame, fortune, life, and everything. She was hanged in
1656, and the farmers of Salem Village and their pastor were old enough
to know, in Mr. Parris' time, how the "famous Mr. Norton," an eminent
pastor, "once said at his own table"--before clergymen and elders--"that
one of their magistrates' wives was hanged for a witch, only for having
more wit than her neighbors;" and to be aware that in Boston "a deep
feeling of resentment" against her persecutors rankled in the minds of
some of her citizens; and that they afterward "observed solemn marks of
Providence set upon those who were very forward to condemn her." The
story of Mrs. Hibbins, as told in the book before us, with the brief
and simple comment of her own pleading in court, and the codicil to her
will, is so piteous and so fearful, that it is difficult to imagine how
any clergyman could countenance a similar procedure before the memory
of the execution had died out, and could be supported in his course
by officers of his church, and at length by the leading clergy of the
district, the magistrates, the physicians, "and devout women not a few."

[Here are evidences of large Cautiousness, fear, and timidity, with the
vivid imagination of untrained childhood.]


PHENOMENA OF WITCHERY.

In the interval between the execution of Mrs. Hibbins and the outbreak
at Salem an occasional breeze arose against some unpopular member of
society. If a man's ox was ill, if the beer ran out of the cask, if the
butter would not come in the churn, if a horse shied or was restless
when this or that man or woman was in sight; and if a woman knew when
her neighbors were talking about her (which was Mrs. Hibbins' most
indisputable proof of connection with the devil), rumors got about of
Satanic intercourse; men and women made deposition that six or seven
years before, they had seen the suspected person yawn in church, and
had observed a "devil's teat" distinctly visible under his tongue; and
children told of bears coming to them in the night, and of a buzzing
devil in the humble-bee, and of a cat on the bed thrice as big as an
ordinary cat. But the authorities, on occasion, exercised some caution.
They fined one accused person for telling a lie, instead of treating his
bragging as inspiration of the devil. They induced timely confession, or
discovered flaws in the evidence, as often as they could; so that there
was less disturbance in the immediate neighborhood than in some other
parts of the province. Where the Rev. Mr. Parris went, however, there
was no more peace and quiet, no more privacy in the home, no more
harmony in the church, no more goodwill or good manners in society.

As soon as he was ordained he put perplexing questions about baptism
before the farmers, who rather looked to him for guidance in such
matters than expected to be exercised in theological mysteries which
they had never studied. He exposed to the congregation the spiritual
conflicts of individual members who were too humble for their own
comfort. He preached and prayed incessantly about his own wrongs and the
slights he suffered, in regard to his salary and supplies; and entered
satirical notes in the margin of the church records; so that he was as
abundantly discussed from house to house, and from end to end of his
parish, as he himself could have desired. In the very crisis of
the discontent, and when his little world was expecting to see him
dismissed, he saved himself, as we ourselves have of late seen other
persons relieve themselves under stress of mind and circumstances, by a
rush into the world of spirits.

Four years previously, a poor immigrant, a Catholic Irishwoman, had
been hanged in Boston for bewitching four children, named Goodwin--one
of whom, a girl of thirteen, had sorely tried a reverend man, less
irascible than Mr. Parris, but nearly as excitable. The tricks that the
little girl played the Reverend Cotton Mather, when he endeavored to
exorcise the evil spirits, are precisely such as are familiar to us, in
cases which are common in the practice of every physician. If we can
not pretend to explain them--in the true sense of explaining--that is,
referring them to an ascertained law of nature, we know what to look for
under certain conditions, and are aware that it is the brain and nervous
system that is implicated in these phenomena, and not the Prince
of Darkness and his train. Cotton Mather had no alternative at his
disposal. Satan or nothing was his only choice. He published the story,
with all its absurd details; and it was read in almost every house in
the Province. At Salem it wrought with fatal effect, because there was a
pastor close by well qualified to make the utmost mischief out of it.

[In cases of hysteria, the phenomena are sometimes so remarkable, that
one is disposed to attribute their cause to influences beyond nature.]


PARRIS AND HIS "CIRCLE."

Mr. Parris had lived in the West Indies for some years, and had brought
several slaves with him to Salem. One of these, an Indian named John,
and Tituba his wife, seem to have been full of the gross superstitions
of their people, and of the frame and temperament best adapted for the
practices of demonology. In such a state of affairs the pastor actually
formed, or allowed to be formed, a society of young girls between the
ages of eight and eighteen to meet in his parsonage, strongly resembling
those "circles" in the America of our time which have filled the lunatic
asylums with thousands of victims of "spiritualist" visitations. It
seems that these young persons were laboring under strong nervous
excitement, which was encouraged rather than repressed by the means
employed by their spiritual director. Instead of treating them as the
subjects of morbid delusion, Mr. Parris regarded them as the victims of
external diabolical influence; and this influence was, strangely enough,
supposed to be exercised, on the evidence of the children themselves, by
some of the most pious and respectable members of the community.

We need not describe the course of events. In the dull life of the
country, the excitement of the proceedings in the "circle" was welcome,
no doubt; and it was always on the increase. Whatever trickery there
might be--and no doubt there was plenty; whatever excitement to
hysteria, whatever actual sharpening of common faculties, it is clear
that there was more; and those who have given due and dispassionate
attention to the processes of mesmerism and their effects can have no
difficulty in understanding the reports handed down of what these young
creatures did, and said, and saw, under peculiar conditions of the
nervous system. When the physicians of the district could see no
explanation of the ailments of "the afflicted children" but "the evil
hand," no doubt could remain to those who consulted them of these
agonies being the work of Satan. The matter was settled at once. But
Satan can work only through human agents; and who were his instruments
for the affliction of these children? Here was the opening through which
calamity rushed in; and for half a year this favored corner of the godly
land of New England was turned into a hell. The more the children were
stared at and pitied, the bolder they grew in their vagaries, till at
last they broke through the restraints of public worship, and talked
nonsense to the minister in the pulpit, and profaned the prayers. Mr.
Parris assembled all the divines he could collect at his parsonage, and
made his troop go through their performances--the result of which was
a general groan over the manifest presence of the Evil One, and a
passionate intercession for "the afflicted children."

[These afflicted children of Salem, in 1690, were kindred to the
numerous "mediums" of 1869. In the former, ignorance ascribed their
actions and revelations to the devil, who bewitched certain persons.
Now, we simply have the more innocent "communications" from where and
from whom you like.]


THE INQUISITIONS.--SARAH GOOD.

The first step toward relief was to learn who it was that had stricken
them; and the readiest means that occurred was to ask this question of
the children themselves. At first, they named no names, or what they
said was not disclosed; but there was soon an end of all such delicacy.
The first symptoms had occurred in November, 1691; and the first public
examination of witches took place on the 1st of March following. We
shall cite as few of the cases as will suffice for our purpose; for
they are exceedingly painful; and there is something more instructive
for us in the spectacle of the consequences, and in the suggestions of
the story, than in the scenery of persecution and murder.

In the first group of accused persons was one Sarah Good, a weak,
ignorant, poor, despised woman, whose equally weak and ignorant husband
had forsaken her, and left her to the mercy of evil tongues. He had
called her an enemy to all good, and had said that if she was not
a witch, he feared she would be one shortly. Her assertions under
examination were that she knew nothing about the matter; that she had
hurt nobody, nor employed anybody to hurt another; that she served
God; and that the God she served was He who made heaven and earth. It
appears, however, that she believed in the reality of the "affliction;"
for she ended by accusing a fellow-prisoner of having hurt the children.
The report of the examination, noted at the time by two of the heads of
the congregation, is inane and silly beyond belief; yet the celebration
was unutterably solemn to the assembled crowd of fellow-worshipers; and
it sealed the doom of the community, in regard to peace and good repute.


A CHILD WITCH.

Mrs. Good was carried to jail. Not long after her little daughter
Dorcas, aged four years, was apprehended at the suit of the brothers
Putnam, chief citizens of Salem. There was plenty of testimony produced
of bitings and chokings and pinchings inflicted by this infant; and she
was committed to prison, and probably, as Mr. Upham says, fettered with
the same chains which bound her mother. Nothing short of chains could
keep witches from flying away; and they were chained at the cost of
the state, when they could not pay for their own irons. As these poor
creatures were friendless and poverty-stricken, it is some comfort to
find the jailer charging for "two blankets for Sarah Good's child,"
costing ten shillings.

What became of little Dorcas, with her healthy looks and natural
childlike spirits, noticed by her accusers, we do not learn. Her mother
lay in chains till the 29th of June, when she was brought out to receive
sentence. She was hanged on the 19th of July, after having relieved her
heart by vehement speech of some of the passion which weighed upon
it. She does not seem to have been capable of much thought. One of
the accusers was convicted of a flagrant lie, in the act of giving
testimony: but the narrator, Hutchinson, while giving the fact, treats
it as of no consequence, because Sir Matthew Hale and the jury of his
court were satisfied with the condemnation of a witch under precisely
the same circumstances. The parting glimpse we have of this first victim
is dismally true on the face of it. It is most characteristic.

"Sarah Good appears to have been an unfortunate woman, having been
subject to poverty, and consequent sadness and melancholy. But she was
not wholly broken in spirit. Mr. Noyes, at the time of her execution,
urged her very strenuously to confess. Among other things, he told her
'she was a witch, and that she knew she was a witch.' She was conscious
of her innocence, and felt that she was oppressed, outraged, trampled
upon, and about to be murdered, under the forms of law; and her
indignation was roused against her persecutors. She could not bear in
silence the cruel aspersion; and although she was about to be launched
into eternity, the torrent of her feelings could not be restrained, but
burst upon the head of him who uttered the false accusation. 'You are a
liar,' said she. 'I am no more a witch than you are a wizard; and if you
take away my life, God will give you blood to drink.' Hutchinson says
that, in his day, there was a tradition among the people of Salem, and
it has descended to the present time, that the manner of Mr. Noyes'
death strangely verified the prediction thus wrung from the incensed
spirit of the dying woman. He was exceedingly corpulent, of a plethoric
habit, and died of an internal hemorrhage, bleeding profusely at the
mouth." (Vol. ii. p. 269.)

When she had been in her grave nearly twenty years, her
representatives--little Dorcas perhaps for one--were presented with
thirty pounds sterling, as a grant from the Crown, as compensation for
the mistake of hanging her without reason and against evidence.
