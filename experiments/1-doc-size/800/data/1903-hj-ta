" Ah, it isn't / who ' like,' dear Mr. Strether, anything to 
do with the matter ! " Sarah Pocock promptly protested ; 
" and I'm by no means sure I have — from my mother or 
from anyone else — a notion of whom you're talking about.' 

"Well, he won't let you see her, you know," Mme. 
de Vionnet sympathetically threw in. " he never lets them
— old friends as we are ; I mean as I am with Maria. He  
reserves her for his best hours ; keeps her thoroughly to
himself; only gives us others the crumbs of the feast." 

" Well, Countess, I've had some of the crumbs,' 
Waymarsh observed deliberately and covering her witt 
his large look, which led her to break in before he could 
go on. 

" Coimnent do it, he shares her with you ? " she exclaimed in droll stupefaction. " Take care you don't have I 
before you go much further, rather more of all ces damet : 
than you may know what to do with ! " 

But he only continued in his massive way. " I can post
you about the lady, Mrs. Pocock, so far as you may caret 
to hear. I've seen her quite a number of times, and I was! 
practically present when they made acquaintance. I've  
kept my eye on her right along, but I don't know that
there's any real harm in her."

" ' H arm ' ? " Mme. de Vionnet quickly echoed. " Why 
she's the dearest and cleverest of all the clever and dear."   

" Well, you run her pretty close. Countess," Waymarshl 
returned with spirit ; " though there's no doubt she's pretty 
well up in things. She knows her way round Europe   
Above all there's no doubt she does love Strether." 

"Ah, but we all do that — we all love Strether; it isn't a
merit!" their fellow-visitor laughed, keeping to her idea
with a good conscience at which our friend was aware that! 
he marvelled, though he trusted also for it, as he met her 





exquisitely expressive eyes, to some later light. The 
prime effect of her tone, however — and it was a truth 
which his own eyes gave back to her in sad ironic play — 
could only be to make him feel that, to say such things to 
a man in public, a woman must practically think of him 
as ninety years old. He had turned awkwardly, respon- 
sibly red, he knew, at her mention of Maria Gostrey ; 
Sarah Pocock's presence — the particular quality of it — 
had made this inevitable ; and then he had grown still 
redder in proportion as he hated to have shown anything 
at all. He felt indeed that he was showing much, as, 
uncomfortably and almost in pain, he offered up his red- 
ness to VV'aymarsh, who, strangely enough, seemed now to 
be looking at him with a certain explanatory yearning. 
Something deep — something built on their old, old relation 
— passed, in this complexity, between them ; he got the 
side-wind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer 
questions. Waymarsh's dry, bare humour — as it gave 
itself to be taken — gloomed out to justify itself. " Well, 
if you talk of Miss Barrace, I've my chance too," it 
appeared stiffly to nod ; and it granted that it was giving 
him away, but struggled to say that it did so only to save 
him. The sombre glow stared it at him till it fairly 
sounded out — " to save you, poor old man, to save you ; to 
save you in spite of yourself." Yet it was somehow just 
this communication that showed him to himself as more 
than ever lost. Still another result of it was to put before 
him as never yet that between his comrade and the interest 
represented by Sarah there was already a basis. Beyond 
all question now, yes — Waymarsh had been in occult 
relation with Mrs. Newsome. Out, out it all came in the 
very effort of his face. "Yes, you're feeling my hand" — 
he as good as proclaimed it ; " but only because this at 
least I shall have got out of your stale Old World : that I 
shall have picked up the pieces into which it has caused 
you to crumble." It was as if, in short, after an instant, 
Strether had not only had it from him, but had recognised 
it, so far as this went, the instant had cleared the air. 
vydr friend understood and approved ; he had the .sense 
that they wouldn't otherwise speak of it. This would be 
all, and it would mark in himself a kind of intelligent 





generosity. It was with grim Sarah then — Sarah grim for 
all her grace — that Waymarsh had begun at ten o'clock in 
the morning to save him. Well — if he coiild  poor dear 
man, with his big, narrow kindness ! The upshot of which 
crowded perception was that Strether, on his own side,! 
still showed no more than he absolutely had to. Hal 
showed the least possible by saying to Mrs. Pocock after! 
an interval much briefer than our glance at the picture asi 
reflected in him : " Oh, it's as true as they please ! There's 
no Miss Gostrey for anyone but me — not the least little 
peep. I keep her to myself" 

" Well, it's very good of you to notify me," Sarah replied 
without looking at him, and thrown for a moment by this  
discrimination, as the direction of her eyes showed, upor  
a dimly desperate little community with Mme. de Vionnet  
" But I hope I shan't miss her too much."  

Mme. de Vionnet instantly rallied. "And, you know— t 
though it might occur to one — it isn't in the least that he's
ashamed of her. She's really — in a way — extremely good 
looking." ' 

" Ah, but extremely ! " Strether laughed while he  
wondered at the odd part he found thus imposed or  
him. ' 

It continued to be so by every touch from Mme. de  
Vionnet. " Well, as I say, you know, I wish you would  
keep me a little more to yourself Couldn't you namt'l 
some day for me, some hour — and better soon than late  
I will be at home whenever it best suits you. There — 
can't say fairer." 

Strether thought a moment, while Waymarsh and Mrs 
Pocock affected him as standing attentive. " I did lately 
call on you. Last week — while Chad was out of town." 

"Yes — and I was away, as it happened, too. You 
chose your moments well. But don't wait for my nex 
absence, for I shan't make another," Mme. de Vionne 
declared, " while Mrs. Pocock is here." 

"That vow needn't keep you long, fortunately," Sarah 
observed with reasserted suavity. " I shall be at present 
but a short time in Paris. I have my plans for othe 
countries. I meet such charming friends " — and her void 
seemed to caress that description of these persons. 





"Ah then," her visitor cheerfully replied, "all the more 
reason ! To-morrow, for instance, or next day ? " she 
continued to Strether. " Tuesday would do for me 
beautifully." 

" Tuesday then with pleasure." 

"And at half- past-five ? — or at six ? " 

It was ridiculous, but Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh 
struck him as fairly waiting for his answer. It was indeed 
as if they were arranged, gathered for a performance, the 
performance of "Europe" by his confederate and himself. 
Well, the performance could only go on. " Say five forty- 
five." 

"Five forty-five — good." And now at last Mme. de 
Vionnet must leave them, though it carried, for herself, the 
performance a little further. " I hoped so much also to see 
Miss Pocock. Mayn't I still ? " 

Sarah hesitated, but she rose equal. " She will return 
your visit with me. She's at present out with my husband 
and my brother." 

" I see — of course Mr. Newsome has everything to show 
them. He has told me so much about her. My great 
desire is to give my daughter the opportunity of making 
her acquaintance. I'm always on the look-out for such 
chances for her. If I didn't bring her to-day, it was 
only to make sure first that you'd let me." After which 
the charming woman rislced a more intense appeal. " It 
wouldn't suit you also to mention some near time, so that 
we shall be sure not to lose you?" Strether, on his side, 
waited, for Sarah likewise had, after all, to perform : and it 
occupied him to have been thus reminded that she stayed 
at home — and on her first morning of Paris — while Chad 
led the others forth. Oh, she was up to her eyes ; if she 
had stayed at home she had stayed, by an understanding, 
arrived at the evening before, that Waymarsh would come 
and find her alone. This was beginning well — for a first 
day in Paris ; and the thing might be amusing yet. But 
Mme. de Vionnet's earnestness was meanwhile beautiful. 
"You may think me indiscreet, but I've suc/i a desire my 
Jeanne shall know an American girl of the really delight- 
ful kind. You see I threw myself for it on your charity." 

The manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of 
u 





depths below it and behind it as he had not yet had — 
ministered in a way that almost frightened him to his dim 
divinations of reasons ; but if Sarah still, in spite of it, 
faltered, this was why he had time for a sign of sympathy 
with her petitioner. " Let me say then, dear lady, to back 
your plea, that Miss Mamie is of the most delightful kind 
of all — is charming among the charming." 

Even Waymarsh, though with more to produce on the 
subject, could get into motion in time. " Yes, Countess, 
the American girl is a thing that your country must at least 
allow ours the privilege to say we can show you. But her 
full beauty is only for those who know how to make use 
of her." 

" Ah then," smiled Mme. de Vionnet, "that's exactly what 
I want to do. I'm sure she has much to teach us." 

It was wonderful, but what was scarce less so was that 
Strether found himself, by the quick effect of it, moved 
another way. " Oh, that may be! But don't speak of your 
own exquisite daughter, you know, as if she were not pure 
perfection. Mile, de Vionnet," he explained in consider- 
able form to Mrs. Pocock, " is pure perfection. Mile, de 
Vionnet is exquisite." 

It had been perhaps a little portentous, but " Ah ? " 
Sarah simply glittered. 

Waymarsh himself, for that matter, apparently recog- 
nised, in respect' to the facts, the need of a larger justice, 
and he had with it an inclination to his ally. "Miss Jane is 
strikingly handsome — in the regular French style." 

It somehow made both Strether and Mme. de Vionnet 
laugh out, though at the very moment he caught in Sarah's 
eyes, as glancing at the speaker, a vague but unmistakable 
"You too?" It made Waymarsh in fact look consciously 
over her head. Mme. de Vionnet meanwhile, however, 
made her point in her own way. " I wish indeed I could 
offer you my poor child as a dazzling attraction ; it would 
make one's position simple enough ! She's as good as she 
can be, but of course she's different, and the question is 
now — in the light of the way things seem to go — if she isn't, 
after all, too different ; too different, I mean, from the 
splendid type everyone is so agreed that your wonderful 
country produces. On the other hand, of course, Mr. 





Nevvsome, who knows it so well, has, as a good friend, dear 
kind man that he is, done everything he can — to keep us 
from fatal benightedness — for my small, shy creature. 
Well," she wound up after Mrs. Pocock had signified, in a 
murmur still a little stiff, that she would speak to her own 
young charge on the question — " well, we shall sit, my child 
and I, and wait and wait and wait for you." But her last 
fine turn was for Strether. " Do speak of us in such a 

way ! " 

" As that something can't but come of it ? Oh, some- 
thing sJiall come of it ! I take a great interest ! " he further 
declared ; and in proof of it, the next moment, he had 
gone with her down to her carriage. 



PART NINTH 



XXII 

THE difficulty is," Strether said to Mme. de Vionnet 
a couple of days later, " that I can't surprise them 
into the smallest sign of his not being the same old Chad 
they've been for the last three years glowering at across 
the sea. They simply won't give any, and as a policy, you 
know — what you call a parti pris, a deep game — that's 
positively remarkable." 

It was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up 
before his hostess with the vision of it ; he had risen from 
his chair at the end of ten minutes and begun, as a help 
not to worry, to move about before her quite as he moved 
before Maria. He had kept his appointment with her to 
the minute and had been intensely impatient, though 
divided in truth between the sense of having everything to 
tell her and the sense of having nothing at all. The short 
interval had, in the face of their complication, multiplied 
his impressions — it being meanwhile to be noted, moreover, 
that he already frankly, already most publicly, viewed the 
complication as common to them. If Madame de Vionnet, 
under Sarah's eyes, had pulled him into her boat, there 
was by this time no doubt whatever that he had remained 
in it and that what he had really most been conscious of 
for many hours together was the movement of the vessel 
itself. They were in it together this moment as they had 
not yet been, and he had not at present uttered the least 
of the words of alarm or remonstrance that had died on 
his lips at the hotel. He had other things to say to her 
than that she had put him in a position ; so quickly had 
his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly, alto- 
gether richly, inevitable. That the outlook, however — 
given the landpoint — had not cleared up half so much 
as he had reckoned was the first warning she had had 
to receive from him on his arrival. She had replied with 







indulgence that he was in too great a hurry, and had 
remarked soothingly that if she knew how to be patient 
surely he might be. He felt her presence, on the spot, he 
felt her tone and everything about her, as an aid to that 
effort ; and it was perhaps one of the proofs of her success 
with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while 
they talked. By the time he had explained to her why his 
impressions, though multiplied, still baffled him, it was as 
if he had been familiarly talking for hours. They baffled 
him because Sarah — well, Sarah was deep; deeper than 
she had ever yet had a chance to show herself. He didn't 
say that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight 
down, as it were, into her mother, so that, given Mrs. New- 
some's profundity, the shaft thus sunk might well have a 
reach; but he was not without the resigned apprehension 
that, at such a rate of confidence, he was likely soon to be 
moved to betray that already, at moments, it had been for 
him as if he were dealing directly with Mrs. Newsome. 
Sarah, to a certainty, would have begun herself to feel it 
in him — and this naturally put it in her power to torment 
him the more. From the moment she knew he could be 
tormented ! 

" But wJiy can you be .'' " — his companion was surprised 
at his use of the word. 

"Because I'm made so — I think of everything." 

' Ah, one must never do that," she smiled. " One must 
think of as few things as possible." 

" Then," he answered, " one must pick them out right. 
But all I mean is — for I express myself with violence — 
that she's in a position to watch me. There's an element 
of suspense for me, and she can see me wriggle. But my 
wriggling doesn't matter," he pursued. " I can bear it. 
Besides, I shall wriggle out." 

The picture, at any rate, stirred in her an appreciation 
that he felt to be sincere. " I don't see how a man can be 
kinder to a woman than you are to me." 

Well, kind was what he wanted to be ; yet, even while 
her charming eyes rested on him with the truth of this, 
he none the less had his humour of honesty. "When I 
say suspense I mean, you know," he laughed, "suspense 
about my own case too ! " 





"Oh, yes — about your own case too!" It diminished 
his magnanimity, but she only looked at him with the 
greater indulgence. 

"Not, however," he went on, "that I want to talk to you 
about that. It's my own little affair, and I mentioned it 
simply as part of Mrs. Pocock's advantage." No, no ; 
though there was a queer present temptation in it, and his 
suspense was so real that to fidget was a relief, he wouldn't 
talk to her about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn't work off on 
her the anxiety produced in him by Sarah's calculated 
omissions of reference. The effect she produced of repre- 
senting her mother had been produced — and that was just 
the immense, the uncanny part of it — without her having 
so much as mentioned that lady. She had brought no 
message, had alluded to no question, had only answered 
his inquiries with hopeless, limited propriety. She had 
invented a way of meeting them — as if he had been a 
polite, perfunctory, poor relation, of distant degree — that 
made them almost ridiculous in him. He couldn't, more- 
over, on his own side, ask much without appearing to 
publish how he had lately lacked the direct and intimate 
news to which he would have been so conspicuously 
entitled ; a circumstance of which it was Sarah's profound 
policy not to betray a suspicion. These things, all the 
same, he wouldn't breathe to Mme. de Vionnet — much as 
they might make him walk up and down. And what he 
didn't say — as well as what she didn't, for she had also 
her high decencies — didn't diminish the effect of his being 
there with her at the end of ten minutes more intimately 
on the basis of saving her than he had yet had occasion 
to be. It ended, in fact, by being quite beautiful between 
them, the number of things they had a manifest conscious- 
ness of not saying. He would have liked to turn her, 
critically, to the subject of Mrs, Pocock, but he so stuck 
to the line he felt to be the point of honour and of delicacy 
that he scarce even asked her what her personal impression 
had been. He knew it, for that matter, without putting 
her to trouble : that she wondered how, with such elements, 
Sarah could still have no charm was one of the prin- 
cipal things she held her tongue about. Strether would 
have been interested in her estimate of the elements — 





indubitably there, some of them, and to be appraised ac- 
cording to taste — but he denied himself even the luxury 
of this diversion. The way Mme. de Vionnet affected him 
to-day was in itself a kind of demonstration of the happy 
employment of gifts. How could a woman think Sarah 
had charm who struck one as having arrived at it herself 
by such different roads? On the other hand, of course, 
Sarah wasn't obliged to have it. He felt as if somehow 
Mme. de Vionnet was. The great question meanwhile 
was what Chad thought of his sister, which was naturally 
ushered in by that of Sarah's apprehension of Chad. This 
they could talk of, and with a freedom purchased by their 
discretion in other directions. The difiiculty, however, 
was that they were reduced as yet to conjecture. He had 
given them in the day or two as little of a lead as Sarah, 
and Mme. de Vionnet mentioned that she had not seen 
him since his sister's arrival. 

" And does that strike you as such an age?" 
She met it in all candour. " Oh, I won't pretend I 
don't miss him. Sometimes I see him every day. Our 
friendship is like that. Make what you will of it ! " 
she whimsically smiled ; a little flicker of the kind, occa- 
sional in her, that had more than once moved him to 
wonder what he might best make of her. " But he's 
perfectly right,", she hastened to add, "and I wouldn't 
have him fail in any way, at present, for the world. I 
would sooner not see him for three months. I begged 
him to be beautiful to them, and he fully feels it for 
himself." 

Strether turned away under his quick perception ; she 
was so odd a mixture of lucidity and mystery. She fell 
in at moments with the theory about her that he most 
cherished, and she seemed at others to blow it into air. 
She spoke now as if her art were all an innocence, and 
then again as if her innocence were all an art. " Oh, he's 
giving himself up, and he'll do so to the end. How can 
he but want, now that it's within reach, his full impres- 
sion ? — which is much more important, you know, than 
either yours or mine. But he's just soaking," Strether said 
as he came back ; " he's going in, conscientiously, for a 
saturation. I'm bound to say he is very good." 




"Ah," she quietly reph'ed, "to whom do you say it?" 
And then more quietly still : " He's capable of anything." 

Strether more than reaffirmed. " Oh, he's excellent. 
I more and more like," he insisted, "to see him with 
them " ; though the oddity of this tone between them grew 
sharper for him even while they spoke. It placed the 
young man so before them as the result of her interest and 
the product of her genius, acknowledged so her part in the 
phenomenon and made the phenomenon so rare, that, more 
than evar yet, he might have been on the very point of 
asking her for some more detailed account of the whole 
business than he had yet received from her. The occasion 
almost forced upon him some question as to how she had 
managed and as to the appearance such miracles presented 
from her own singularly close standpoint. The moment, 
in fact, however, passed, giving way to more present history, 
and he continued simply to mark his appreciation of the 
happy truth. " It's a tremendous comfort to feel how one 
can trust him." And then again while, for a little, she said 
nothing — as if, after all, to her trust there might be a 
special limit : " I mean for making a good show to them." 

" Yes," she thoughtfully returned, " but if they shut their 
eyes to it ! " 

Strether for an instant had his own thought. " Well, 
perhaps that won't matter ! " 

" You mean because he probably — do what they will — 
won't like them ? " 

"Oh, 'do what they will'! They won't do much, 
especially if Sarah hasn't more — well, more than one has 
yet made out — to give." 

Mme. de Vionnet weighed it. " Ah, she has all her 
grace!" It was a statement over which, for a little, they 
could look at each other sufficiently straight, and though it 
produced no protest from Strether, the effect was somehow 
as if he had treated it as a joke. " She may be persuasive 
and caressing with him ; she may be eloquent beyond 
words. She may get hold of him," she wound up — " well, 
as neither you nor I have." 

" Yes, she viayl' and now Strether smiled. " Rut he has 
spent all his time each day with Jim. He's still showing 
Jim round." 





She visibly wondered. " Then how about Jim ? " 
Strether took a turn before he answered. " Hasn't he 
given you Jim ? I mean, before this, done him for you ? " 
He was a little at a loss. " Doesn't he tell you things ? " 

She hesitated. " No " — and their eyes once more gave 
and took — " not as you do. You, somehow, make me see 
them — or at least feel them. And I haven't asked too 
much," she added. " I've wanted so of late not to worry 
him." 

"Ah, for that, so have I," he said, with encouraging assent ; 

so that — as if she had answered everything — they were 

briefly sociable on it. It threw him back on his other ' 

thought, with which he took another turn, stopping again,   

however, presently with something of a glow, " You see ; 

Jim's really immense. I think it will be Jim who'll do it." 

She wondered, " Get hold of him   " 

" No ; just the other thing. Counteract Sarah's spell." 1 

And he showed now — our friend — how far he had worked 

it out, "Jim's intensely c 'nical." ' 

"Oh dear Jim ! " Mme. de Vionnet vaguely smiled. : 

"Yes, literally, dear Jim ! He's awful. What /   wants, ! 

— heaven forgive him — is to help us." I 

" You mean " — she was eager — " help me P " 

" Well, Chad and me in the first place. But he throws I 

you in too, though without, as yet, seeing you much, 

Only, so far as he does see you — if you don't mind — he ' 

sees you as very advanced." r 

" ' Advanced ' ? " She wanted it all, 

" A regular bad one, though, of course, of a tremendously   

superior kind. Dreadful, delightful, irresistible." 

" Ah dear Jim ! I should like to know him. I must!' 
"Yes, naturally. But will it do? You may, you know,"   
Strether suggested, " disappoint him." 

She was droll and humble about it. " I can but try. 
But my wickedness then," she went on, " is my recom- 
mendation for him ? " 

" Your wickedness and the charms with which, in such   
a degree as yours, he associates it. He understands, you ' 
see, that Chad and I have, above all, wanted to have a,; 
good time, and his view is simple and sharp. Nothing ,5 
will persuade him — in the light, that is, of my behaviour — ' 





that I really didn't, quite as much as Chad, come over 
to have one before it was too late. He wouldn't have 
expected it of me ; but men of my age, at Woollett — and 
especially the least likely ones — have been noted as liable 
to strange outbreaks, belated, uncanny clutches at the 
jnusual, the ideal. It's an effect that a lifetime of Woollett 
las quite been observed as having ; and I thus give it 
;o you, in Jim's view, for what it's worth. Now his wife 
ind his mother-in-law," Strether continued to explain, 
' have, as in honour bound, no patience with such per- 
brmances, late or early ; which puts Jim, as against his 
elatives, on the other side. Besides," he added, " I don't 
hink he really wants Chad back. If Chad doesn't 
:ome " 

" He'll have," Mme. de Vionnet quite apprehended, 
more of the free hand ? " 

" Well, Chad's the bigger man." 

" So he'll work now, dessous, to keep him quiet ? " 

" Xo, he won't ' work ' at all, and he won't do anything 
n dessous. He's very decent, and he won't be a traitor in 
he camp. But he'll be amused with his own little view 
four duplicity ; he'll sniff up what he ecstatically supposes 
be Paris from morning till night, and he'll be, as to the 
est, for Chad — well, just what he is." 

She thought it over. " A solemn warning? " 

He met it almost with glee. " You arc as wonderful as 
verybody says ! " And then to explain all he meant : " I 
rove him about for his first hour, and do you know what 
-all beautifully unconscious — he most put before me? 
v'hy, that something like that is at bottom, as an improve- 
lent to his present state, as in fact the real redemption of 
hat they think it may not be too late to make of our 
g friend." With which, as, taking it in, she seemed, 

tier recurrent alarm, bravely to gaze at the possibility, he 

nipleted his statement. "But it is too late. Thanks to 

.u ! " 

It drew from her again one of her indefinite reflections. 

Oh, 'me'— after all!" 

He stood before her so exhilarated by his demonstration 

at he could fairly be jocular. " Everything's compara- 





" You " — she could but answer him — " are better than 
anything." But she had another thought. " IVt// Mrs.  
Pocock come to me ? " 

" Oh yes — she'll do that. As soon, that is, as my friend 
Waymarsh — her friend now — leaves her leisure." 

She showed an interest. " Is he so much her friend as 
that ? " 

" Why, didn't you see it all at the hotel ? " 

"Oh" — she was amused — "'all' is a good deal to say. 
I don't know — I forget. I lost myself in her." 

" You were splendid," Strether returned — " but ' all ' 
isn't a good deal to say ; it's only a little. Yet it's 
charming so far as it goes. She wants a man to her- 
self." 

" And hasn't she got you ? " 

" Do you think she looked at me — or even at you — a5 
if she had ? " Strether easily dismissed that pleasantry 
" Everyone, you see, must strike her as having somebody 
You've got Chad — and Chad has got you." 

" I see " — she made of it what she could. " And you'v( 
got Maria." 

Well, he on his side accepted that. " I've got Maria 
And Maria has got me. So it goes." 

" But Mr. Jim— whom has he got ? " 

" Oh, he has. got — or it's as t/ he had — the whole place. 

"But for Mr. Waymarsh "—she recalled— " isn't Mis 
Barrace before anyone else ? " 

He shook his head. "Miss Barrace is a raffince, and he 
amusement won't lose by Mrs. Pocock. It will gain rathe 
— especially if Sarah triumphs and she comes in for ; 
view of it." 

" How well you know us ! " Mme. de Vionnet, at thi.' 
frankly sighed. 

"No — it seems to me it's ivc that I know. I know Saral 
— it's perhaps on that ground only that my feet are firrr 
Waymarsh will take her round, while Chad takes Jim- 
and I shall be, I assure you, delighted for both of then 
Sarah will have had what she requires — she will have pai« 
her own tribute to the ideal ; and he will have done abou 
the same. In Paris it's in the air — so what can one d 
less? If there's a point that, beyond any other, Sara 





wants to make, it's that she didn't come out to be narrow. 
We shall feel at least thaty 

" Oh," she groaned, " the quantity we seem likely to 
' feel ' ! But what becomes, in these conditions, of the 
girl?" 

" Of Mamie — if we're all provided ? Ah, for that," said 
Strether, " you can trust Chad." 

" To be, you mean, all right to her ? " 

" To pay her every attention as soon as he has polished 
off Jim. He wants what Jim can give him — and what 
Jim really won't — though he has had it all, and more than 
all, from me. He wants, in short, his own personal impres- 
sion, and he'll get it — strong. But as soon as he has got it 
Mamie won't suffer." 

"Oh, Mamie mustn't suffer!''' Mme. de Vionnet sooth- 
ingly emphasised. 

But Strether could assure her. " Don't fear. As soon 
as he has done with Jim, Jim will fall to me. And then 
you'll see." 

It was as if, in a moment, she saw already ; yet she still 
waited. Then, "Is she really quite charming?" she 
isked. 

He had got up with his last words and gathered in his 
hat and gloves. " I don't know ; I'm watching. I'm 
studying the case, as it were — and I dare say I shall be 
ible to tell you." 

She wondered. " Is it a case ? " 

"Yes — I think so. At any rate I shall see." 

" But haven't you known her before ? " 

"Yes," he smiled — " but somehow at home she wasn't a 
:ase. She has become one since." It was as if he made 
t out for himself. " She has become one here." 

" So very, very soon ? " 

He hesitated, laughing. " Not sooner than I did." 

 ' And you became one ? " 

" Very, very soon. The day I arrived." 

Her intelligent eyes showed her thought of it. "Ah, but 
he day you arrived you met Maria. Whom has Miss 
'ocock met ? " 

He paused again, but he brought it out. " Hasn't she 
net Chad?" 








" Certainly — but not for the first time. He's an old 
friend." At which Strether had a slow, amused, signifi- 
cant headshake that made her go on : " You mean that 
for her at least he's a new person — that she sees him as 
different ? " 

" She sees him as different." I 

" And how does she see him ? " 

Strether gave it up. " How can one tell how a deep   
little girl sees a deep young man ? " 

" Is everyone so deep ? Is she so too ? " I 

" So it strikes me — deeper than I thought. But wait ! 
a little, and, between us, we'll make it out. You'll judge, l 
for that matter, for yourself." 

Mme. de Vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on 
the chance. "Then she will come with her? I mean 
Mamie with Mrs. Pocock ? "   

" Certainly. Her curiosity, if nothing else, will in any 
case work that. But leave it all to Chad." 

" Ah," wailed Mme. de Vionnet, turning away a little '! 
wearily, " the things I leave to Chad ! " l
