blood. But army life in California ! It 
meant languishing in barracks, hoping for 
a flash in the pan between two rival houses, 
or a possible revolt against a governor. 
If the Americans should come with intent 
to conquer! Roldan ground his teeth 
and stamped his foot. Then, indeed, he 
could not get to the battlefield fast enough. 
But the United States would never defy 
Mexico. They were clever enough for 
that. His anger left him, and he gave a 
little regretful sigh. Not only would he 
like that kind of a battle, but it would be 
great fun to know some American boys. 
Then he shook his head impatiently and 
dismissed these tourist thoughts. The 
present alone was to TDC considered. 

There were two ways to avoid conscription. 
One was to marry Roldan sniffed 
audibly ; the other lay in flight and 
eluding the men until their round was over for 
the year. 

Roldan did not like the idea of running 
away from anything ; he and several of his 
father's vaqueros had once made an assault 
upon a band of cattle thieves and hunted 
them into the mountains: that was much 
more to his taste. Nevertheless there was 
one thing he liked less than showing his 
heels, and that was giving up his liberty. 
Not to gallop at will over the rancho, or 
sleep in a hammock, tocoliar the bulls and 
shout with the vaqueros at rodeo, to be the 
first at the games and the races, to wear his 
silken clothes and lace ruffles, and eat the 
delightful dishes his mother's cooks 
prepared ! And then he was a very high- 
spirited young gentleman. Although the 
same obedience, almost reverence, was 
exacted of him by his parents that was a 
part of the household religion in 
California, yet as the youngest child, who had 
been delicate during his first five years, 
ho had managed to get very badly spoiled. 
He did not relish the idea of leading a life 
of monotony and discipline, of performing 

hourly duties which did not suit his taste, 
above all of being ordered to leave his 
father's house as if he were a mere Indian. 
No, he decided, he would not go into the 
arm y not this year nor any other year. 
He would defy the governor and all his 
men. 

When Roldan made up his mind he 
acted promptly. No time was to be lost 
in this case. Now was the hour of siesta ; 
he could have no better time to get away. 
A note would relieve his parents of a 
certain amount of anxiety ; and if they did not 
know where he was they could not be held 
accountable. His blood tingled at the 
presentiment of the adventures he should 
have in that perilous journey through a 
country of which he knew nothing beyond 
his father's and the adjoining rancho. And 
as adventures would be but half spiced if 
experienced alone, he determined and 
not from selfish motives only to save 
his best beloved friend, Adan Pardo, from 
the grasp of the law likewise. 

He went within and slung about him 
self two pistols and a dagger. After he 

had made a small bundle of linen and 
raided the pantry, he went out to the 
corral, saddled his horse and packed the 
&gt;udclle bags, wound his lariat securely 
about the pommel, then galloped away 
on a series of adventures memorable in 
the annals of California. 


ROLDAN'S way lay over his father's 
leagues until two hours after night 
fall. As he passed, every now and again, 
a herd of cattle, lounging vaqueros called 
to him : " Ay, Don Roldan, where do you 
go ? " or, " The little senor chooses a hot 
day for his ride." But he excited no curi 
osity. Like all Californians he half lived 
in the saddle ; and he was often seen 
riding in the direction of Don Esteban 
Pardo's rancho, to spend a few days with 
his chosen friend. 

As he approached the house he saw the 
family sitting on the long verandah : the 
pretty black-eyed girls in full white gowns, 
their dark hair flowing to the floor, or 
braided loosely ; Don Esteban, a silk hand 
kerchief knotted about his head, reclining 
in a long chair beside his wife, a stout 
woman, coffee-coloured with age, attired 
in a dark silk gown flowered with roses. 



 

Indian servants came and went with cool 
ing drinks. Although it was December, 
Winter had loitered and fallen into deeper 
sleep than usual on her journey South this 
year. 

Adan was leaning against a pillar, moody 
and bored. He was the youngest of the 
boys. His brothers, elegant caballeros, 
who spent most of their time in the capital 
or on other ranches, were kind to their 
younger brother, but not companionable. 
Therefore, when Roldan galloped into 
sight, he gave a shout of joy and ran 
down the road. Roldan drew rein some 
distance from the house, that the 
conference, which must take place immediately, 
might be unheard by older ears. 

" Listen, my friend," he said rapidly, 
interrupting Adan's voluble hospitality. 
" The soldiers are out for conscripts " 

Ay, yi! " 

" Now listen, and don't talk until I am 
done. I will not be drafted as if I had no 
will of my own, and rot in a barrack while 
others enjoy life. Neither will you if you 
have the spirit of a Pardo and are worthy 

to be the friend of Roldan Castanada. So 

I fly. Do you understand ? and you 
go with me. We ,will dodge these servants
of a tyrant government the length 
and breadth of the Californias. When the 
clanger is over for this year we will return 

not before. Now, you will ask me to 
go to my room as soon as possible after 
you have given me some supper, for I am 
tired and want sleep. You also will take 
a nap. When all is quiet I shall call you 
and we will start." 

Adan had listened to this harangue 
with bulging eyes and tongue rolling 
over his teeth. But Roldan never failed 
to carry the day. He was a born leader. 
Adan's was the will that bent; but his 
talent for good comradeship and his quiet 
self-respect saved him from servility. 

In appearance he was in sharp contrast 
to the slender Roldan, of the classic feat 
ures and fiery eyes. Short, roly-poly, 
with a broad, good-natured face, his attire 
was also unmarked by the extreme elegance 
which always characterised Roldan. In 
summer he wore calico small-clothes, in 


winter unmatched articles of velvet of
cloth, and an old sombrero without silver. 

-Ay! yil" he gasped. "Ay, Roldan ! 
Holy Mary ! But you are right. You 
always are. And so clever! I will go. 
Sure, sure. Come now, or they will think 
we conspire." 

Roldan dismounted, and was warmly 
greeted by the family. The girls rose 
and courtesied, blushing with the coquetry 
of their race. Roldan cared little for girls 
at any time, and to-night was doubly 
abstracted, his ear straining at every
distant hoof-beat. He retired as early as he 
politely could, but not to sleep. Indeed, 
he became so nervous that he could not 
wait until the family slept. 

&gt;l Better to brave them, Adan," he said 
to his more phlegmatic friend, " than that 
sergeant, should he get here before we 
leave. Come, come, let us go." 

They dropped out of the window and 
^tole to the corral where the riding horses 
were kept. It was surrounded by a high 
Vail, and the gate was barred with iron ; 
but they managed to remove the bars 



without noise, saddled fresh horses and 
led them forth and onward for a half mile, 
then mounted and were off like the wind. 

They knew the country down the coast 
on the beaten road, but they dared not 
follow this, and struck inland. The air 
was now of an agreeable warmth ; the full 
moon was so low and brilliant that Roldan 
called out he could count the bristling 
hairs on a coyote's back. 

In less than two hours they were climb 
ing a mountain trail leading through a 
dense redwood forest. In these depths 
the moon's rays were scattered into mere 
flecks dropping here and there through 
the thick interlacing boughs of the giant 
trees. Those boughs were a hundred feet 
and more above their heads. About 
them was a dense underforest of young 
redwoods, pines, and great ferns; and 
swarming over all luxuriant and poison 
ous creepers. 

They were silent for a time. The red 
wood forests are very quiet and awesome. 
At night one hears but the rush of the 
mountain torrent, the cry of a panther or 


a coyote, the low sigh of wind in the 
treetops. 

"Ay, Roldan," exclaimed Adan, sud 
denly. " Think did we meet a bear ? " 

" We probably shall," said Roldan, coolly. 
"These forests have many grizzlies, as 
the Americans call them." 

" But what should we do, Roldan ? " 

" Why, kill him, surely." 

" Have you ever seen one ? " 

" Never." 

" But it is said that they are very large, 
my friend, larger than you or I." 

" Perhaps. Keep quiet. I like to hear 
the forest talk." 

" What strange fancies you have, Roldan. 
A forest cannot talk." 

" Oh hush." 

" Ay, yi, Roldan ! Roldan ! " 

The horses were standing upright, 
neighing pitifully. Adan gave a hoarse 
gurgle and crossed himself. 

" The adventures have begun," said 
Roldan. 

In a swarth of moonlight on a 
^c some yards above them, standing on 
his hind legs and swinging his forepaws 
goodnaturedly, was an immense grey bear. 
Suddenly he extended his arms sociably, 
almost affectionately. 

" We cannot retreat down that steep 
trail," said Roldan, rapidly. " He could 
follow faster and the horses would fall
To the left ! in the brush, quick ! a bear 
cannot run sideways on a mountain." 

The boys dug their spurs into the trem 
bling mustangs, who responded with a 
snort of pain and plunged into the thicket. 
Only the bold skill of the riders saved them 
from pitching sidewise down the steep 
slope, despite the brush, for they were
unshod and their knees had weakened. 

But the grizzly, alas! was still master 
of the situation. In less than a moment 
the boys saw him lumbering along above 
them. He evidently had possession of a 
trail, more or less level. 

" Dios de mi alma!" cried Adan. "If 
he gets ahead of us he will come down 
and meet us somewhere. We shall be 
lost eaten even as a cat eats a mouse, a 
coyote a chicken." 

"You will look well lining the dark 
corridors of the bear, my friend. Your 
yellow jacket with those large red roses, 
which would make a bull sweat, would 
hang like tapestry in the houses of Spain. 
Those hide boots, spotted with mud, and 
the blood of the calf, would keep him 
from wanting another meal for many a 
long day " 

" Ay, thou fearless one ! Why, it is said 
that if the grizzly even raises his paw and 
slaps the face every feature is crushed out 
of shape." 

" I should not be surprised." 

They plunged on, tearing their clothes 
on the spiked brush and the thorns of the 
sweetbrier, fragrant lilac petals falling in 
a shower about them, great ferns trodden 
and rebounding. The air was heavy with 
perfume and the pungent odour of red- 
wood and pine. 

Roldan had passed Adan. Suddenly 
his horse stumbled and would have gone 
headlong had not his expert rider pulled 
him back on his haunches. 

"What is it? What is it?" cried 


Adan, who also had been obliged to pull 
in abruptly, and who liked horses less 
when they stood on their hind legs. " Is 
it the bear upon us ? But, no, I hear him 
above and beyond. What are you 
doing, my friend ? " 

Roldan had dismounted and was on his 
hands and knees. In a half moment he 
stood erect. 

" We are saved," he said. 

" Ay ? What ? " 

" It is a hole, my friend large and 
deep and round. Did you put any meat 
in your saddle-bags ? " 

" Ay, a good piece." 

"Raw?" 

" Yes." 

"Give it to me quick. Do not un 
wrap it." 

Adan handed over the meat, then dis 
mounted also. 

" A bear-trap ? " he asked. 

"Yes, a natural one. Come this way, 
before I unwrap the meat." 

The boys forced their way to the south 
of the large hole, dragging the still 
terrified horses, who were not disposed to 
respond to anything less persuasive than 
the spur. Roldan approached the edge of 
the excavation and shook the meat loose, 
fiinging the paper after it. As the smell 
of fresh beef pervaded the air it was 
greeted by a growl like rising thunder, 
and almost simultaneously the huge 
unwieldy form of the bear hurled itself 
down through the brush. The boys held 
their breath. Even Roldan felt a singing 
in his ears. But the grizzly, without 
pausing to ascertain his bearings, went 
down into the hole at a leap. He made 
one mouthful of the meat, then appeared 
to realise that he was in a trap. With a 
roar that made the horses rear and neigh 
like stricken things, he flung himself 
against the sides of his prison, drew back 
and leaped clumsily, tore up the earth, and 
galloped frantically to and fro. But he 
was caught like a rat in a trap. 

The boys laughed gleefully and remounted their horses, which also seemed 
to appreciate the situation, for they had 
quieted suddenly. 



 

" Adios ! Adios ! " cried Roldan, as they 
forced their way up to the trail the bear 
had discovered. " You will make a fine 
skeleton ; we will come back and look at 
you some day." 

But it was not the last they were to see 
of Bruin in the flesh. 

AN hour later they began to descend 
the mountain on the other side, and 
by dawn espied a ranch house in a valley. 
The white walls were pink under the first 
streamers of the morning. The redwoods 
rose like a solid black wall on the towering 
mountains on every side. 

" Ay ! " exclaimed Roldan, drawing a 
deep sigh. " Sleep and a hot breakfast. 
They will be good once more." 

"They will," answered Adan, who had 
been collapsing and digging his knuckles 
into his eyes for an hour and more. 

They feared that no one might be stir 
ring, but, as they approached the verandah, 
the door opened and a stout smiling Cali- 
fornian, dressed in brown small-clothes, 
appeared. 

" Who have we here ? " he cried. " But 
you are early visitors, my young friends." 


" We are dodging the conscript," said 
Roldan. " You will not betray us ? " 

" I should think not. I'd hide my own 
boys, if the mountains did not do that for 
me. Come in, come in. The house is 
yours, my sons. Burn it if you will. 
Tired ? Here. Go in and get into bed. 
The servants are not up, but I myself will 
make you chocolate and a tortilla." 

The boys did not awaken for eight 
hours. When they emerged, somewhat 
shamefacedly, they found the family as 
sembled on the verandah, drinking their 
afternoon chocolate, and impatient with 
curiosity. There were no girls to criticise
the dilapidated garments which the 
kind hostess had mended while the boys 
slept; but there were two youths of 
fourteen and fifteen and two young men 
who were lying in hammocks and smoking 
cigaritos. 

Roldan and Adan were made welcome 
at once. 

" My name is Jose Maria Perez," said 
the host, coming forward. " This is my 
wife, Dona Theresa, and these are my 


sons, Emilio, Jorge, Benito, and Carlos. 
What shall we call you, my sons?" 

" My name is Roldan CastaRada of the 
Rancho Los Palos Verdes, and this is my 
friend Adan Pardo of the Rancho Buena 
Vista." 

"Ay! we have distinguished visitors. 
But you were just as welcome before. Sit 
down while I go and see if the big stew 
I ordered is done. Caramba! but you 
must be hungry." 

The four lads quickly fraternised, and 
Roldan began at once to relate their 
adventures, continuing them over the 
steaming dish of stew. When he reached 
the point which dealt with the outwitting 
of the bear, Don Emilio sprang from his 
hammock. 

"A bear trapped?" he cried. "A 
grizzly ? We will have a fight with a bull. 
You are rested, no ? As soon as you have 
eaten, come and show us the way." 

The boys, always ready for sport, and 
believing that they were beyond the grasp 
of the law for the present, eagerly con 
sented. An hour later Don Emilio, Don 



 

Jorge, the four lads, and three vaqueros 
all sallied forth to capture one poor 
bear. The vaqueros dragged a sled, and 
much stout rope. 

When they reached the trap darkness 
had come, but the four boys held lighted 
torches over the hole this was their 
part. The bear, disheartened with his long 
and futile effort to escape, lay on the 
uneven surface below, alternately growling 
and roaring. As the torches flared above 
him he sprang to his feet with a vast roar, 
his eyes as green and glittering as marsh 
lights. In a moment a lasso had flown 
over his head and he was on his back. 
But his formidable legs were not to be 
encountered rashly. Each was lassooed 
in turn, also his back; then his huge 
lunging body was dragged up the side 
of the excavation and onto the sled. 
There he was bound securely ; then the 
rope about his neck was loosened and 
he was fed on a hind quarter of sheep. 
But it placated him little. His anger 
was terrific. He roared until the echoes 
awoke, and strained at the rope until it 

seemed as if his great muscles must 
conquer. 

But he was powerless, and the proces 
sion started: first Roklan and Benito 
with their torches; then two vaqueros 
dragging the sled, the third holding the 
rope which encircled the bear's neck, 
ready to tighten it on a second's notice. 
Following were Don Jorge and Don 
Kmilio, then the two other young torch 
bearer-. Thus was poor Bruin carried 
ignominiously out of the forest where he 
had been lord, to perform for the benefit 
of the kind he despised. That night he 
rested alone in a high walled corral, 
liberated by the quick knife of one of the 
vaqueros, who sprang through the door 
just in time to save himself. 

There was an angry guest on the ranch 
that night. The bear's lungs, which were 
of the best, had little repose, and he flung 
himself against the earth walls of the corral 
until they quivered with the impact. The 
horses in the neighbouring corrals 
whinnied ; the cows in the fields bellowed. It 
was a vocal night, and few slept. 

Nevertheless everybody was excited and 
good-natured next morning. Immediately 
after breakfast they went out to the corral, 
and by means of a ladder mounted the 
wall and stood on the broad summit. At 
a signal from Don Emilio a vaquero 
opened the gate cautiously and drove in 
a large bull, who had been carefully 
irritated since sunrise. 

The two unamiable beasts, glad of an 
object to vent their spleen upon, flew at 
each other. The bear, giant as he was, 
was ignominiously rolled in the dust by 
the furious onslaught of bulk and horns. 
He recovered himself with surprising 
alacrity, however, and rushed at the bull. The 
latter, off guard for the moment, and strug 
gling for his lost breath, was hurled on his 
back. He rolled over quickly, but before 
he could gather his legs under him, the 
bear sat himself squarely upon the heavy 
flanks. The bull jerked up his head, his 
eyes injected, his tongue rolling out. The 
bear raised one of his mighty paws and 
dealt him a box on the ear. The head 
fell with an ugly thud on the hard floor 

of the corral. The bear adjusted himself 
comfortably and licked his paws. 

On the wall the onlookers were far 
more excited than the gladiators in the 
arena. The Perez sympathised with their 
personal property, but Roldan and Adan 
felt that the bear was their menagerie, and 
that their honour was at stake. Party 
feeling ran very high. Roldan and Benito 
were twice separated by their anxious 
elders. 

"Ay! yi!" cried Carlos. "The bull 
wakes." 

The poor bull, in truth, despite the 
crushing weight on his vitals, raised his 
head again, shook himself feebly, and was 
once more boxed into unconsciousness. 
The side of his face was crushed ; his 
body was slowly flattening. The family 
encouraged him with tears and spirit. 

" Ay, Ignacio, Ignacio, my poor one ! "
cried Don Jose. " Arouse thyself and 
kill the brute. Ay ! thou wert so beautiful, 
so elegant, thy sleek sides like the satin of 
Dona Theresa and he like a wild man 
that has never washed. Where is thy 
pride, Ignacio? .Arouse thyself!" 


Thus encouraged, the bull raised his 
head once more. The bear gave him a 
whack that snapped his spinal cord, then 
rose and swung himself round the enclosure
with the arrogant mien of a bloated 
sultan who has swept off a troublesome 
head. This attitude aroused Benito to 
fury. 

" Ay, the cheat ! the assassin ! " he cried. 
" It was not a fair fight. Our Ignacio had 
no chance " 

" That is not true ! " exclaimed Roldan. 
" He had the same chance at the first. If 
you are not satisfied, Senorito Benito, then 
fight me." 

No sooner said than done. The boys, 
who stood some distance from the others, 
doubled their fists and rushed at each 
other like two fighting cocks. They pom 
melled for several minutes, then locked 
their arms about each other and went 
reeling about the wall, to the horror of the 
others, who dared not approach lest they 
should inflame them further. 

" Jump down ! Jump down, you im 
beciles ! " cried Don Jose. " Do you wish 



 

to be food for the bear ? A misstep " 
The words ended in a hoarse gurgle. 
Dona Theresa shrieked. Adan and Car 
los sobbed. The young men turned cold 
and weak. The two boys had fallen head 
long into the corral. 

They were sobered and fraternal in a 
moment. The bear stood upon his hind 
legs and opened his arms invitingly. He 
stood in front of the gate. 

" Ay! ay!" gasped Benito. "He wili 
eat us!" 

" No ; he will eat the bull first ; but he 
will hug us to death that is, if he gets 
us which he won t. Adan!" he cried, 
" lower the ladder." 

Benito began to cry, his terror enhanced 
by the babel of voices on the wall, each of 
which was suggesting a different measure. 
On the opposite wall and in the branches 
of a neighbouring tree were the Indian 
servants and "the vaqueros. They stared 
stupidly, with shaking lips. 

Adan had recovered his presence of 
mind. With a firm hand, he lowered the 
ladder. But his wit was not quick. He 

should have carried it along the wall and 
placed it behind the boys. Instead, it de 
scended several yards away. The bear, 
who appeared to be no fool, lowered his 
forepaws and trotted slowly toward the 
boys. 

"Juan ! " shouted Roldan to a vaquero. 
" Lasso the bull and drag him to the west 
side far from the gate." 

The vaquero, alert enough under orders, 
swung the lasso with supple wrist and 
missed. The boys dodged the bear, who 
seemed in no haste, but stalked them 
methodically, nevertheless. The vaquero 
swung again. This time the rope caught 
the horns, was tightened by a quick turn, 
and the carcass went thudding across the 
yard. The bear gave a furious howl and 
plunged after. The boys scampered up the 
ladder. Don Jose took each by the collar 
and shook them soundly. When they 
were released they embraced each other. 

"Ay! but I was inhospitable to fight 
my guest," sobbed Benito. 

" Ay, my friend," said Roldan, with dig 
nity, winking back the tears started by 
various emotions. " It is I who should have 
had my ears boxed by the bear for insult 
ing my host, and bringing anguish to the 
house of Perez." Then he embraced Adan, 
but this time mutely. 

Doila Theresa had been carried to her 
room, where she lay prcstrated with a ner 
vous headache; but her family and guests 
did ample justice to the chickens stewed 
in tomatoes, the red peppers and onions, 
the fried rice, tomales, and dulces which 
her cook had prepared in honour of the 
event. Excitement and good will reigned ; 
even Don Jose had forgiven the young 
offenders, and they all talked at once, at 
the top of their voices, as fast as they could 
rattle and with no falling inflection.
Roldan and Adan were pressed to remain at 
the Hacienda Perez until the search was 
over, and although the former had a secret 
yearning for adventure he was more than 
half inclined to consent. 

After a brief siesta the entire male
population of the hacienda retired to the wall 
of the corral to pot the bear. It was 
agreed that each should fire at once, and 



 

that he who missed should have no dulces 
for a week. 

The bear was sitting near the middle of 
the corral, surly but replete, for he had 
eaten of the bull. Don Jose gave the 
signal. Twenty-two shots were fired. 
The bear gave a roar which awoke the 
echoes of the forest, lunged frantically on 
shattered legs, then fell, an ugly heap of 
dusty grey hair. 

As the smoke cleared and Don Jose 
was announcing that only two Indian 
servants had missed, Benito clutched Roldan's 
arm suddenly. 

" Look up," he said. " Do you see any 
thing? Are not those men ; soldiers ? " 

Roldan looked up to a ledge of the 
high mountain before the house. A bend 
of the trail traversed a clearing. In this 
open were three men on horseback, mo 
tionless for the moment. 

" Adan ! " shouted Roldan. He ran 
down the ladder. 

" I cannot be sure that those are the sol 
diers," he called up to Don Jose. " But I 
take no risks. We must go."
