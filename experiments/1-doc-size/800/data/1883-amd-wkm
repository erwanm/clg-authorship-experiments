and robust, was not enough ; there wat a diviner grace. 
Yes, he must be saved, even if as by fire. His longing love 
might not desire it 

He rose then, almost overshadowing the slenderer figure. 
His step was uncertain, groping. 





" I think I have been a madman ! " he said in deepest 
humiliation. " I have gone to the very brink of destruction, 
trusting in my own might. But I shall never rest until I 
have found the greater strength. You need not be afraid 
to trust me." 

He started as if to go. " No, you will stay with me to- 
night," Charlie said. " It is late, and I want you to help 
me. If Bruce knew Kathie was quite free if I wrote 
they are going to Egypt soon, I believe. But he had bet- 
ter come home." 

" I wronged you a while ago. I said you did not 
know." 

" I do know. We both know that a love given away 
may grow into something higher than a love kept for one's 
self." 

" But yon have the right to give," he cried, bowing his 
head in an agony of shame. 

There was not much sleep for them that night. Robert 
Alston's thoughts would have kept him awake if it had 
not been for the almost intolerable headache. And he had 
been shown himself the thing he night become if left to 
his own devices, his human side, with no interposition. 
But he believed now that Fay Collamore could not have 
been tempted into any specious waiting, any wrong step, 
only he knew she had seen, and put away, like these other 
brave souls. There was a great deal of it to do in this 
world. 

Mr. Meredith rallied him somewhat the next day on his 
paleness, little dreaming of the struggle. He had one 
more duty before the new life could quite begin, and that 
was a letter to Uncle Robert, who came to answer it, in 
person. And Robert Alston realized then how easy it was 
to make the innocent suffer for the guilty. No one ever 
bore a crime or a shame quite alone. Some other heart 
was always wrung with anguish, often the one who should 
be nearest and dearest, first considered. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

THEY were in the glow and throb of mid-summer again. 
Kathie Alston stood on the wide balcony, nodding to baby 
Bertie below, who was making imaginary visits and com- 
ing back for cunning good-byes. Then espying Uncle Rob- 
ert, she ran like a sprite to meet him, and he caught her 
in his arms. 

Kathie ran down as well. She was radiant in health and 
brightness. All the cares and perplexities seemed over- 
past. She had simply to live, to take up the nearest duty. 

" I am jealous ! " laughingly. " I don't even have one 
arm any more." 

'But I must have one hand. Stand down a minute, 
Bertie ; I have a load of letters for Aunt Kathie. Doesn't 
that sound staid and ancient," smiling. "Here is one 
from Mrs. Truesdell, from Miss Fay ; and oh, what will 
you give me for my news ? " 

"A kiss used to be sufficient," with a piquant sparkle in 
her eye ; " but you have so many from my rival " 

"Take me up, Uncle Robert, take me up," said the 
imperious little queen. 

" A spoiled child ! What would become of her but for 
mamma and me ? And the news ? " 

"It is funny how many times we have said it. Aunt 
Ruth is in New York ; she is coming home to-morrow. I 
had a telegram." 

" Oh, how lovely ! So they gave up Egypt. Or did 
Bruce go on alone ? " 

" The telegram says ' we.'" 





" Oh, I do wonder The boys will be delighted ! Rob 
is fairly homesick for a sight of him." 

" Some letters for me?" demanded Bertie, as they sat 
down on the wide step. 

" There, this will do ; oh, no, this," giving her the tel- 
egram. " There was a letter from Chicago." 

" Uncle Robert," said Kathie seriously, " suppose she," 
nodding toward the letter, " should quite recover? " 

" That does not seem possible." 

" I have thought of it sometimes. What would Rob do? 
He has begun to be so curiously conscientious of late." 

" Why curious?" 

" Unusually, then. Do you know I think Rob singu- 
larly attracted by beautiful women. He always admired 
Fay Collamore greatly. And you all say she is so hand- 
some." 

" Her beauty alone could not win him back." 

" But duty might," Kathie returned gravely. " Still, we 
never could give up Bertie. It always seems to me as if 
her mother must be dead." 

Uncle Robert stooped to kiss the baby lips. u She is 
mine,", he said, " to comfort me after you all go away." 

Kathie smiled. She had been glancing over Fay's let- 
ter. Miss Collamore's episode had not culminated in an 
engagement ; why, she knew best. Just at that juncture 
Louise had been taken seriously ill with a fever, and Mr. 
Hunsdon had called on Fay's sisterly offices. On her par- 
tial recovery they had been sent to the mountains. 

"Mrs. Hunsdon is doing beautifully," Kathie announced ; 
" and oh, Dick Grayson is up there ! How odd they should 
stumble over each other ! " 

Then she opened Sarah's letter, and before she had 
read a dozen lines she uttered another exclamation. 

"Uncle Robert, listen to this. Mr. Truesdell has an ex- 
cellent call to Westport. The church is quite large, united, 
and flourishing, the salary very fair, and a house. Two 





of Sarah's pupils are married and settled there. It seems 
like such a splendid opportunity " 

" Well? " filling the pause. 

" To live a broader life. For, after all, there is just so 
much of a round in Middleville, and no more. They have 
conquered their place and a peace, I might say respect, for 
I do think Sarah's wise patience has served to unite and 
raise the very ordinary congregation. I should like to 
see her at her best estate. And Charlie has a high opin- 
ion of Mr. Truesdell." 

She could quote Charlie again quite comfortably. He 
would not let the break make a difference. Mrs. Alston 
had become quite reconciled, though he had said to her, 
" I cannot give up my old love for you ; it has in it all a 
son's reverence." 

Oddly -enough Charlie and Rob had been great friends 
of late. They all discerned a gradual change in the latter. 

" Rob is growing wonderfully like uncle," declared Fred 
daily. 

" I think Mr. Truesdell well fitted for a much larger 
sphere. I wondered at first how he could resign himself to 
the place, though there is a work everywhere." 

Mrs. Alston came out presently, and was delighted with 
the news. 

" I do think Ruth is very tired of rambling about," she 
said. u I hope now they have come to stay." 

Kathie arranged the guest chamber again, and made it 
sweet with flowers. Would Bruce come or not? How 
oddly quiet it would be this summer. Emma was away 
painting some seaside views that had been ordered. The 
olden, meny group were scattered far and wide ; even the 
Merediths were going elsewhere, and would not spend 
more than a fortnight at Brookside. 

Mrs. Alston and Kathie went over m the family carriage. 
There was dear Aunt Ruth, grown a little older, but sweet 
as ever, and the General, looking much better than last 
year. 





" And no Bruce ! " Kathie said. There was not a very 
keen disappointment in her tone. 

"Oh, the boys took possession of him at once ! I began 
to wonder if I had any rights in my own son," said the 
General with an assumption of injury. u I shall have to 
come to you for comfort, as I have times before." 

Kathie slipped her hand into his. It seemed almost like 
going back to the happy childhood when she first knew him. 
And she remembered how he had asked permission to bring 
Bruce to Cedarwood, that long-ago summer. 

" Am I to be left quite out in the cold? " she asked. 
" I am learning that the boys can do very well without me ; 
the end of youthful admiration, I suppose." 

They took up Uncle Robert at the post-office, and Bertie 
was running about the lawn watching for him. 

"How wonderfully like Rob in his babyhood !" Aunt 
Ruth said. 

" She is the happiest of all happy children," said Mrs. 
Alston. " I wonder at it sometimes ; but I think much 
of it is due to Mrs. Fleming's judicious nursing and train- 
ing. I am thankful she fell into such good hands." 

Cedarwood was so quiet and restful. It had that well- 
used home look, nothing obtrusive, nothing that had been 
thrust in, but the general growth of needed things, of 
beauty thought and planned year after year. The great 
porch now was rich in vines, that gave shade by day and 
sweetness at night. They went out in the evening and 
talked over the many happenings of the year and more 
since the last parting. 

Bruce was quite recovered in health and strength, but 
there would always be a little weakness about the hip joint 
that would need thoughtfulness, if not care, and would 
not admit of a life of hardship. He had sent in his army 
resignation and turned his attention to literary pursuits, in 
which he had done a little at the West. They would always 
have him now. 




Kathie listened with a thrill of interest. She wondered 
she had not suspected Bruce's penchant the winter of his 
illness, when they used to read and talk so much. 

He was to be down in a day or two. Rob meant to get 
a holiday and come with him. 

" I must congratulate you on your fine and manly son, 
Mrs. Alston," the General said. " If I had none of my 
own I should want to adopt him." 

The mother smiled, pleased with a deeper joy than mere 
satisfaction in a handsome presence. 

They enjoyed another day resting up. A telegram from 
Bruce saying he would be down the next evening with 
Robert. 

Kathie was in a curious little maze of excitement, inno- 
cent, glad, and girlish. Their coming seemed to have 
taken her out of the rather grave present. Everything 
appeared fresh, and bright, and hopeful. 

They were planning some pleasure the next morning 
when a messenger came with another telegram for Mr. 
Conover. He opened it and looked rather disturbed. 

" Not bad news?" said Kathie. 

He hated to damp her joy. " I hardly know," slowly. 
"There is some change at Chicago. I think I shall have 
to go, and it might be better to take Rob. I must go to 
the city immediately," rising with unwonted alacrity. 

She misunderstood, and he did not correct her, but he 
told Mrs. Alston the full import. There had been so many 
little improvements that a partial recovery had been spoken 
of, and Kathie took this as an indication of it. There was 
a brief hurry and no time to ask questions. 

Late in the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Adams came over 
to call on the Mackenzies. 

" You will have to drive down for Bruce," said the Gen- 
eral smilingly to Kathie. 

"Yes, I will honor him with my pony phaeton. Oh, 
can you really believe that Bruce has never been here 





since his return from Europe ? Why, it will seem quite a 
new place to him/' 

A slight flush touched the father's face. He knew the 
reason so well ; she was so innocent of it. Ah, if Bruce 
should fail this time ! 

She drove slowly down ; there was plenty of time. As 
she sat there in the phaeton she wondered if she had bet- 
ter get out on the platform. If he was watching he could 
surely see her. 

The train came whistling and crunching on the rails, 
and all the air was hazy for a moment. Then a confusion 
of forms and faces, and yes, a wave of the hand that 
brought the bright color to her cheek. 

"Kathie!" 

Bruce!" 

It was all they said for the first instant. Then Kathie's 
expectant, uplifted eyes wavered, trembled. She made a 
pretence of turning aside the robe and giving him the 
seat. There was a curious rushing consciousness, a sur- 
ging of blood at her heart, a sort of deep sea ringing in 
her ears, and her hand trembled. 

He took it in his so fond and warm. He almost knew. 
Her fingers had never throbbed under his pressure before, 
and her breath came in a great gasp. 

" How awkward ! " she said. u You are in the driver's 
seat and must do duty. Every rank in life has its corre- 
sponding penalties." 

" These are not very severe." He straightened himself 
up. How brown and well he looked, and how softly 
bright his eyes were, as if some fire was veiled in their 
depths. 

" We were all so surprised," she said at length. " You 
did not go to Egypt." 

" No, my next tour will be straight around the world, I 
think," laughingly. " But I should like to stay at home 
five years, at least." 
 





Five years. Why should it seem so brief to her ? And 
then 

" Which way? You see I am a stranger." 

"Hero would know, anyhow," with a bright smile. 
" But it has changed wonderfully since you were here." 

" That was so long ago. What a lovely avenue ! And 
there is the lake. And Cedarwood ! Why, it is like some 
beautiful dream." 

"I have brought your son home to you," Kathie ex- 
claimed as she sprang out of the phaeton beside General 
Mackenzie. 

He bent and kissed her tenderly. Once he had said 
almost the same words to her mother. 

" Then Robert went on to Chicago?" Mrs. Alston asked, 
as she shook hands with the distinguished-looking young 
man. 

Kathie blushed vividly. How could she have forgotten 
everything ? 

" Yes," Bruce made answer. " Mr. Conover thought it 
better, I believe." 

They all walked in together. Kathie ran to her room 
and tried to bathe some of the troublesome color out of 
her face. What had happened to her? Surely she was 
not used to this much excitement over so simple a thing as 
the coming of a visitor. 

They had a strangety quiet evening. A sense of satis- 
faction pervaded them all, and, after the first few inquiries 
about absent friends, Kathie went to the piano and played 
some of the old things that had been such a rare pleasure to 
Bruce that remembered winter. Ah, why should she think 
of them now ? Was it comfort again ? He sat and listened 
as if in a trance. There was only the light in the hall and 
the moon flooding the room through the open windows. 
All was so niysteriously sacred, as if he had gone into some 
dream country and was listening to the flow of soft, wind- 
ing streams, of silver bells blown about by the wind. 





She was there. She was free for him. Honor had held 
her so securely before, that there had been no temptation. 
And the grand, generous heart that had given her up, 
the dear friend of her childhood and youth ? For an instant 
it seemed to Bruce as if he ought not to accept the sac- 
rifice. 

The soft flow of music ceased. She came over to the 
sofa with a curious, half-unconscious nearness. 

' ' Have I played you asleep ? I used to do that, you 
know?" 

He took both hands in his and drew her nearer. His 
love was such an old familiar thing to him, but quite new 
and strange to her, he could see that. Yet was it awak- 
ening ? 

" You were so good to me through those days of pain." 
The voice was tenderly suggestive. She drew her hands 
softly away again. What was this coming upon her? 

" Let us go out and walk," he said. " The night is so 
lovely." 

It was stifling here, she thought. The others sat at the 
lower end of the room, talking in a low tone. They passed 
them and went out on the porch, down the steps. The 
wide, warm night lay all about them, the stars glowed softly 
overhead, and the very grass at their feet quivered as the 
tender wind swept over it. It was so new to her, though 
she had seen it hundreds of times before. An enchantment 
transfixed her. 

" Kathie," he cried suddenly, and his tone seemed to 
penetrate every pulse with its sweetness, "Kathie, do 
you know, can you think, why I have come back? I can- 
not wait for the tardy hours to whisper my secret. I love 
you ! I have loved you always, it seems to me, and now 
that you are free I have come to win, if possible, the great 
joy of my life ! " 

" Oh ! " She uttered a sharp, pathetic cry. " I wonder if 
I would have the right to take the joy at so high a price ? 





For I have wounded the noblest heart, and it seems as if 
my life could be none too long a penance " 

" He gave you to me, my darling. His great love was 
not content with merely setting you free, he wrote. I 
can almost guess how he learned my secret, and bade me 
come back and try. For I should not have come other- 
wise for years, unless }~ou had been his wife. I did not 
mean to be tempted with the portion put aside for an- 
other. I waited at first because my father thought it best, 
and all that long winter I wonder if I sometimes ap- 
peared unthankful to you ; but God was keeping me away 
from the temptation I could so illy bear, on the safe, sweet 
side. I am so glad I never wronged Charlie in word or 
deed. But now, now, Kathie? " 

What was this sudden thrill of desire, this great wave of 
intense satisfaction that flooded her heart like a high tide 
and floated her toward him with no doubt or question ? 
She could not ask if it were love, she was simply and 
supremely content. 

He drew her toward him and kissed the dewy, throb- 
bing lips. She remembered then so many little events, 
flashes, something shown and withheld at the same 
moment. Why could she not have seen ? And if she had 
seen, would she not have believed it her duty to uproot 
every fibre of an unlawful longing? Yes, her right to take 
this love now, lay in the fact of truth, perfect and entire ; 
she had never made any kind of barter with her own soul. 

" Kathie ! " The tone was so soft, so entreating, so 
lover-like, impatient. 

She put her hands in his, for she could not speak just 
then. It was so new, so delicious, so overwhelming. 
Ah, she knew now. 

They walked up and down the path in happy silence. 
The fragrant wind, the rhythmic stars, the satisfaction of 
the whole world, told their story for them. Was it 
moments or a lifetime ? 





" We must go in," she said in timid entreaty. The 
girl's delicate sense was returning. There was a nutter in 
her face, in every pulse. 

He turned and led her back, up the steps, her hand in 
his, her face shyly averted with the strange, new knowl- 
edge, the girlish abashment. 

" Truants ! " her mother exclaimed. 

Kathie was thankful for the shaded lights, the fragrant 
dusk, the carelessly unconscious tone. 

" Yes, it is getting late," she said in a rich, tremulous 
voice that missed her mother, but caught Aunt Ruth's 
longing ear. 

She rose hastily. " I suppose it is time we broke up 
our conclave," with a little smile. " Kathie, my darling, 
good night," with a tender kiss. 

She went to her mother, and then held out her hand to 
the General, but she had no courage to raise her eyes 
to Bruce. They all went up-stairs together, and said 
another good-night. 

Kathie hurried to her room. She made quick work with 
her toilet, for she wanted to be in the dark and the 
silence to think. She buried her face in the pillow as if 
to stifle its heat and blushes. Was this great happiness 
for her? Could she, dared she, feel at home and rejoice 
in it? 

She lingered the next morning until she heard them all 
go down. If Uncle Robert were here. 

Bruce was waiting for her in the hall, his eyes luminous 
with happiness, his face full of grand content. 

" They all know," he whispered ; and then she seemed in 
the midst of them, receiving approval in their tender 
kisses. But she could not talk about it. Aunt Ruth saw 
that and came to her rescue, shielding her from obtrusive 
demonstrations. 

" I hope you have made no mistake this time, Kathie," 
her mother said afterward, gently, yet as if she could not 
quite forget. 




" O mamma, I wonder if I have a right to take so 
exquisite a happiness ! " 

"Yes, you foolish little child." And with the kiss she 
gave, vanished the last remnant of bitterness. 

"But I do not want to make any real promise until 
Uncle Robert comes. And oh, if " 

" It will be well with them," Mrs. Alston rejoined hur- 
riedly. " That must not mar your delight." 

" And so I shall have my little girl," the General said 
with deep emotion. " Kathie, the first time I saw you, 
a strange little girl in a box at the opera, you went straight 
to my heart. I wanted you then, and if you had not been 
so well loved and sheltered I should have begged to adopt 
you. But how do you suppose Uncle Robert and I will 
ever get it settled ? " 

Uncle Robert telegraphed when he reached Chicago. 
The poor invalid was living. More than that he would 
not say, for he had a faint presentiment there might be a 
sacred joy at Cedarwood that he would not disturb. 

But they had found Robert's wife unconscious, slowly 
breathing her last. There had been two strokes of paral- 
ysis in rapid succession. Up to the time of the first seiz- 
ure they had considered her improving, and began to hope 
for partial restoration. 

One side of her face had been a little drawn, but she 
lay calm and still beautiful. There was no change through 
the hours, and death came so silently at last that the trained 
eye of the nurse hardly told when the little flicker of life 
went out. 

" It seems very sad," Robert Alston said, when they re- 
turned to the hotel. " I cannot pretend to any deep grief, 
for her utter indifference destroyed what might have been 
affection on my part, and yet to-day I give thanks that 
God kept me from any wild, desperate act. I might have 
made myself, in my madness, the very thing I so hated and 
despised in her. O Uncle Robert, I believe I did learn 





at last to be patient in God's time, to do the work ap- 
pointed for my transgression, and until you came, a few 
days ago, I had no thought of her dying, of my freedom. 
I had so resolved to live that I should not be ashamed or 
confused at the last, to ask for nothing." 

He bowed his head and wept silently. Uncle Robert 
laid his hand affectionately on the shoulder. 

" It has been a hard fight, my dear boy, but you have 
come off conqueror." 

" ' Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory.' " He 
rose as he reverently uttered this. " And, Uncle Robert, 
I think no boy, no young man, ever had a truer, stronger 
friend than you have been to me. All that is fine and 
noble in me I shall owe to you and Charlie Darrell." 

"There was some good soil, Rob." And the elder smiled 
in his old, meaning way. " It was a rich soil, and the great 
struggle was which should grow the fastest, the wheat or 
the tares." 

"And you have been a faithful gardener. My whole 
life from this time must be an endeavor to repay you. For 
you took all the burden, all the trouble. What if I 
had been left alone?" And he shuddered, remembering 
many bitter hours. 

" God never leaves us quite alone unless we place our- 
selves outside of help, and reject it because it is not what 
we want, paying no regard to our real needs. But I had 
my reward the night Charlie Darrell helped you to decide." 

Robert Alston's wife was buried in a quiet corner of the 
cemetery. The one name on her headstone, "Addie," would 
tell no story to the passer-by. Her mother had been once 
to the asylum, but had left no address, and with the notice 
in the paper Mr. Conover considered their duty ended. 

He had written to Mrs. Alston, but he knew he would 
reach home almost as soon as the letter, lie came by 
himself and walked up from the station, finding Mrs. Als- 
ton quite alone, to his great satisfaction. 





''Robert wants you very much," he said after the first 
news was told. " The boys are all at the Merediths, with 
the housekeeper, and it would be more agreeable to Rob to 
have you to himself awhile, if you would not mind going." 

" I think I can be spared, and I must see my boy," she 
answered with deep feeling. 

It was arranged that she should start the next morning. 
The others came back from their drive, and the evening 
was spent discussing graver subjects thnn those of love ; 
but Uncle Robert was quite satisfied. His questions were 
answered by the deep joy in Kathie's eyes, and the color 
that mantled her cheek at a thought, the quick flutter in 
her voice, and the many little signs that told how deeply 
her heart had been touched. 

" Conover," the General said, as he was pacing the long 
drawing room that evening, " you and I of all other men 
must give thanks for the blessing vouchsafed to us in our 
boys. I think you can hardly have a doubt about the 
future. And it is the young men of the present who are to 
be the statesmen, rulers, and fathers of the next genera- 
tion Can we, dare we turn them adrift with no firm prin- 
ciples and ill-regulated wills, no strict sense of honor, 
integrity, and manliness, no definite purpose of fighting 
and conquering the temptations on every side ? If we fail 
in our duty, and what is more, our example, what shall 
they believe ? And our country's future welfare depends 
upon them. It has a wider significance than our own 
small lives." 



CHAPTER XXVIH. 

KATHIE ALSTON'S marriage was set down for Christmas. 
She chose the day, because there were so many sweet and 
sacred memories connected with it. 

" And you know, mamma," she said, " I was reading 
my Christmas fairy book the day that I first began to think 
what I ought really to do, that I wanted to be a fairy for 
your sake, when we were so poor and Aunt Ruth was ill." 

Mrs. Alston smiled. She was enjoying her daughter's 
happiness without stint, and surely the fine-looking Lieu- 
tenant Mackenzie was enough to gratify any mother's 
pride. 

But Kathie did not lose interest in her old friends amid 
the new anticipations. She was glad to welcome back the 
summer strays, and find Mrs. Hunsdon quite restored to 
health and Fay sisterly sweet. Then, too, Sarah's affairs 
called for some attention. 

Mr. and Mrs. Truesdell came down for a day. Mr. 
Truesdell wished to consult Mr. Conover, for he relied 
greatly on his judgment. 

" My people are all very united now, and I think would 
be truly sorry to have me go," he said, " but the social 
life is narrow, and there can be no great gathering in. 
Some young man or some elderly shepherd could fill my 
place, while it seems to me I am fitted for the heat and the 
burden of the day. I want to do a wider work. And 
Mrs. Truesdell would be of so much service in the great 
world. It seems like wasting time and energy, although 
nothing, I suppose, is really wasted. But I do not want to 
feel that the larger salary draws me. Although we could 





have as many comforts at Middle ville on the smaller sum, 
I dare say, Westport is wider. There is a class of young 
people, mill hands and in shops, that ought to be reached 
find interested. They are too often left out between the 
wealthy and the class on which we expend sympathy and 
charity, and they go to ruin b} f scores. Mrs. Truesdell 
could be of great service in such a work." 

" I think there is no question," Mr. Conover returned. 
"The world needs constant, steady workers, and every 
man ought to deal his best blows where they will tell. 
There is too much waste of positive material in your spend- 
ing both your lives in a little place like Middleville." 

Sarah and Kathie discussed it as well, with the fine, 
girong conscientiousness of the former. And }"et Sarah 
was deeply interested in Kathie's prospects, a little disap- 
pointed that it had not all come to pass as first planned. 

" You would have been drawn so closely into my life," 
she said. " I used to think how we would compare, and 
plan, and strive to the utmost. And yet my first fancy 
was that you would marry Bruce Mackenzie." 

Kathie blushed brightly. 

Fay had said the same thing. The first time she had 
heard of Bruce she had set the unknown hero beside Kathie. 

They were all well satisfied when they heard, a week 
later, that Mr. Truesdell had accepted, and would remove 
as soon as possible. James Strong had married a nice, 
tidy, sensible girl, one of his sister's pupils, and his 
parents were much pleased. 

There was a great deal of planning and going to and fro. 
After the wedding the Mackenzie family would settle 
themselves in New York, but in the spring they would 
return to Brookside permanantly and set up a household 
of their own. Rob was delighted. No brothers of blood 
could be nearer or tenderer. His regard for Charlie Dar- 
rell was something sacred and reverential, and, indeed, on 
this ground Bruce's warmest sympathies met and blended 



with his. The deeper side of both natures had been stirred 
by this gentler spirit which had taken fast hold intellectu- 
ally and spiritually upon the deeper things of God. 

Robert Alston was a little more grave, perhaps, yet when 
the first shock was over, of the event he had never allowed 
himself to imagine since that fearful night, could be. and 
he was somewhat accustomed to a sense of freedom, he 
settled readily into the new sphere. He was the elder 
brother, the stay and comfort of his mother. Out of all
