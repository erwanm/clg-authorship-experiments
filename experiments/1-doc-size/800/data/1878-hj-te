apparition that this announcement seemed to complete his unreality. " What cousin ? Who are 
you ? " said Gertrude. 

He stepped back a few paces and looked up at 
the house ; then glanced round him at the garden 
and the distant view. After this he burst out 
laughing. " I see it must seem to you very 
strange," he said. There was, after all, something 
substantial in his laughter. Gertrude looked at 
him from head to foot. Yes, he was remarkably 
handsome ; but his smile was almost a grimace. 
" It is very still," he went on, coming nearer 
again. And as she only looked at him, for reply, 
he added, " Are you all alone ? " 

"Every one has gone to church," said Ger- 
trude. 

" I was afraid of that ! " the young man ex- 
claimed. " But I hope you are not afraid of me." 

" You ought to tell me who you are," Gertrude 
answered. 

"Tarn afraid of you!" said the young man. 



 

" I had a different plan. I expected the servant 
would take in my card, and that you would put 
your heads together, before admitting me, and 
make out my identity." 

Gertrude had been wondering with a quick in- 
tensity which brought its result; and the result 
seemed an answer a wondrous, delightful an- 
swer to her vague wish that something would 
befall her. " I know I know," she said. " You 
come from Europe." 

" We came two days ago. You have heard of 
us, then you believe in us ? " 

" We have known, vaguely," said Gertrude, 
" that we had relations in France." 

" And have you ever wanted to see us? " asked 
the young man. 

Gertrude was silent a moment. " I have wanted 
to see you." 

" I am glad, then, it is you I have found. We 
wanted to see you, so we came." 

" On purpose ? " asked Gertrude. 

The young man looked round him, smiling still. 
" Well, yes ; on purpose. Does that sound as if 
we should bore you ? " he added. " I don't think 
we shall I really don't think we shall. We 
are rather fond of wandering, too ; and we were 
glad of a pretext." 

" And you have just arrived ? " 



   

" In Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked 
for Mr. Wentworth. He must be your father. 
They found out for me where he lived ; they 
seemed often to have heard of him. I determined 
to come, without ceremony. So, this lovely morning, they set my face in the right direction, and 
told me to walk straight before me, out of town. 
I came on foot because I wanted to see the country. I walked and walked, and here I am ! It 's 
a good many miles." 

" It is seven miles and a half," said Gertrude, 
softly. Now that this handsome young man was 
proving himself a reality she found herself vaguely 
trembling ; she was deeply excited. She had never 
in her life spoken to a foreigner, and she had often 
thought it would be delightful to do so. Here 
was one who had suddenly been engendered by 
the Sabbath stillness for her private use ; and 
such a brilliant, polite, smiling one ! She found 
time and means to compose herself, however : to 
remind herself that she must exercise a sort of 
official hospitality. " We are very very glad 
to see you," she said. " Won't you come into the 
house ? " And she moved toward the open door. 

" You are not afraid of me ; then ? " asked the 
young man again, with his light laugh. 

She wondered a moment, and then, " We are 
not afraid here," she said. 



 

" Ah, comme vous devez avoir raison ! " cried 
the young man, looking all round him, appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had 
heard so many words of French spoken. They 
gave her something of a sensation. Her companion followed her, watching, with a certain excite- 
ment of his own, this tall, interesting-looking girl, 
dressed in her clear, crisp muslin. He paused in 
the hall, where there was a broad white staircase 
with a white balustrade. " What a pleasant 
house ! " he said. " It 's lighter inside than it is 
out." 

"It's pleasanter here," said Gertrude, and she 
led the way into the parlor, a high, clean, rather 
empty-looking room. Here they stood looking at 
each other, the young man smiling more than 
ever ; Gertrude, very serious , trying to smile. 

"I don't believe you know my name," he said. 
" I am called Felix Young. Your father is my 
uncle. My mother was his half sister, and older 
than he." 

" Yes," said Gertrude, " and she turned Roman 
Catholic and married in Europe." 

" I see you know," said the young man. " She 
married and she died. Your father's family did n't 
like her husband. They called him a foreigner ; 
but he was not. My poor father was born in 
Sicily, but his parents were American." 



   

" In Sicily ? " Gertrude murmured. 

" It is true," said Felix Young, " that they had 
spent their lives in Europe. But they were very 
patriotic. And so are we." 

" And you are Sicilian," said Gertrude. 

" Sicilian, no ! Let 's see. I was born at a 
little place a dear little place in France. 
My sister was born at Vienna." 

" So you are French," said Gertrude. 

" Heaven forbid ! " cried the young man. Ger- 
trude's eyes were fixed upon him almost insist- 
ently. He began to laugh again. " I can easily 
be French, if that will please you." 

" You are a foreigner of some sort," said Ger- 
trude. 

" Of some sort yes ; I suppose so. But who 
can say of what sort? I don't think we have 
ever had occasion to settle the question. You 
know there are people like that. About their 
country, their religion, their profession, they can't 
tell." 

Gertrude stood there gazing ; she had not asked 
him to sit down. She had never heard of people 
like that ; she wanted to hear. " Where do you 
live?" she asked. 

" They can't tell that, either ! " said Felix. I 
am afraid you will think they are little better 
than vagabonds. I have lived anywhere every- 



 

where. I really think I have lived in every city 
in Europe." Gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation. It made the young man smile at her 
again ; and his smile made her blush a little. To 
take refuge from blushing she asked him if, after 
his long walk, he was not hungry or thirsty. Her 
hand was in her pocket ; she was fumbling with 
the little key that her sister had given her. " Ah, 
my dear young lady," he said, clasping his hands 
a little, " if you could give me, in charity, a glass 
of wine ! " 

Gertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and 
went quickly out of the room. Presently she 
came back with a very large decanter in one hand 
and a plate in the other, on which was placed a 
big, round cake with a frosted top. Gertrude, 
in taking the cake from the closet, had had a 
moment of acute consciousness that it composed 
the refection of which her sister had thought that 
Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her kinsman 
from across the seas was looking at the pale, high- 
hung engravings. When she came in he turned 
and smiled at her, as if they had been old friends 
meeting after a separation. "You wait upon me 
yourself ? " he asked. " I am served like the 
gods ! " She had waited upon a great many peo- 
ple, but none of them had ever told her that. The 
observation added a certain lightness to the step 



   

with which she went to a little table where there 
were some curious red glasses glasses covered 
with little gold sprigs, which Charlotte used to 
dust every morning with her own hands. Ger- 
trude thought the glasses very handsome, and it 
was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was 
good ; it was her father's famous madeira. Felix 
Young thought it excellent ; he wondered why 
he had been told that there was no wine in Amer- 
ica. She cut him an immense triangle out of the 
cake, and again she thought of Mr. Brand. Felix 
sat there, with his glass in one hand and his huge 
morsel of cake in the other eating, drinking, 
smiling, talking. " I am very hungry," he said. 
" I am not at all tired ; I am never tired. But I 
am very hungry." 

" You must stay to dinner," said Gertrude. 
" At two o'clock. They will all have come back 
from church ; you will see the others." 

" Who are the others ? " asked the young man. 
" Describe them all." 

" You will see for yourself. It is you that must 
tell me ; now, about your sister." 

" My sister is the Baroness Miinster," said 
Felix. 

On hearing that his sister was a Baroness, Ger- 
trude got up and walked about slowly, in front 
of him. She was silent a moment. She was think- 



 

ing of it. " Why did n't she come, too ? " she 
asked. 

" She did come ; slie is in Boston, at the hotel." 

" We will go and see her," said Gertrude, look- 
ing at him. 

" She begs you will not ! " the young man re- 
plied. " She sends you her love ; she sent me to 
announce her. She will come and pay her respects 
to your father." 

Gertrude felt herself trembling again. A Bar- 
oness Minister, who sent a brilliant young man to 
" announce " her ; who was coming, as the Queen 
of Sheba came to Solomon, to pay her " respects " 
to quiet Mr. Wentworth such a personage presented herself to Gertrude's vision with a most 
effective unexpectedness. For a moment she 
hardly knew what to say. "When will she 
come ? " she asked at last. 

"As soon as you will allow her to-morrow. 
She is very impatient," answered Felix, who 
wished to be agreeable. 

" To-morrow, yes," said Gertrude. She wished 
to ask more about her ; but she hardly knew what 
could be predicated of a Baroness Minister. " Is 
she is she married ? " 

Felix had finished his cake and wine ; he got 
up, fixing upon the young girl his bright, express- 
ive eyes. " She is married to a German prince 




Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. 
He is not the reigning prince ; he is a younger 
brother." 

Gertrude gazed at her informant ; her lips were 
slightly parted. " Is she a a Princess ? " she 
asked at last. 

" Oh, no," said the young man ; " her position 
is rather a singular one. It 's a morganatic mar- 
riage." 

" Morganatic ? " These were new names and 
new words to poor Gertrude. 

" That 's what they call a marriage, you know, 
contracted between a scion of a ruling house and 

and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a 
Baroness, poor woman ; but that was all they 
could do. Now they want to dissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a 
ninny; but his brother, who is a clever man, has 
plans for him. Eugenia, naturally enough, makes 
difficulties ; not, however, that I think she cares 
much she 's a very clever woman ; I 'm sure 
you 'll like her but she wants to bother them. 
Just now everything is en Vair." 

The cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor 
related this darkly romantic tale seemed to Ger- 
trude very strange; but it seemed also to convey 
a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her 
wisdom and dignity. She felt a dozen impressions 



 

stirring within her, and presently the one that 
was uppermost found words. " They want to 
dissolve her marriage ? " she asked. 

" So it appears." 

" And against her will ? " 

" Against her right." 

" She must be very unhappy ! " said Gertrude. 

Her visitor looked at her, smiling ; he raised 
his hand to the back of his head and held it there 
a moment. " So she says," he answered. " That 's 
her story. She told me to tell it you." 

" Tell me more," said Gertrude. 

" No, I will leave that to her ; she does it bet- 
ter." 

Gertrude gave her little excited sigh again. 
" Well, if she is unhappy," she said, " I am glad 
she has come to us." 

She had been so interested that she failed to 
notice the sound of a footstep in the portico ; and 
yet it was a footstep that she always recognized. 
She heard it in the hall, and then she looked out 
of the window. They were all coming back from 
church her father, her sister and brother, and 
their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sun- 
day. Mr. Brand had come in first ; he was in 
advance of the others, because, apparently, he was 
still disposed to say what she had not wished him 
to say an hour before. He came into the parlor, 



   

looking for Gertrude. He had two little books in 
his hand. On seeing Gertrude's companion he 
slowly stopped, looking at him. 

" Is this a cousin ? " asked Felix. 

Then Gertrude saw that she must introduce him ; 
but her ears, and, by sympathy, her lips, were 
full of all that he had been telling her. " This is 
the Prince," she said, " the Prince of Silberstadt- 
Schreckenstein ! " 

Felix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood 
staring, while the others, who had passed into the 
house, appeared behind him in the open door-way. 




THAT evening at dinner Felix Young gave his 
sister, the Baroness Miinster, an account of his 
impressions. She saw that he had come back in 
the highest possible spirits ; but this fact, to her 
own mind, was not a reason for rejoicing. She 
had but a limited confidence in her brother's judg- 
ment ; his capacity for taking rose-colored views 
was such as to vulgarize one of the prettiest of 
tints. Still, she supposed he could be trusted to 
give her the mere facts ; and she invited him with 
some eagerness to communicate them. " I sup- 
pose, at least, they did n't turn you out from the 
door ; " she said. " You have been away some ten 
hours." 

" Turn me from the door ! " Felix exclaimed. 
" They took me to their hearts ; they killed the 
fatted calf." 

" I know what you want to say : they are a 
collection of angels." 

" Exactly," said Felix. " They are a collection of angels simply." 

" C'est bien vague," remarked the Baroness. 
" What are they like ? " 



" Like nothing you ever saw." 

" I am sure I am much obliged ; but that is 
hardly more definite. Seriously, they were glad 
to see you ? " 

" Enchanted. It has been the proudest day of 
my life. Never, never have I been so lionized ! 
I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear 
sister," said the young man, "nous n'avons qu'a 
nous tenir ; we shall be great swells ! " 

Madame Minister looked at him, and her eye 
exhibited a slight responsive spark. She touched 
her lips to a glass of wine, and then she said, "Describe them. Give me a picture." 

Felix drained his own glass. " Well, it 's in 
the country, among the meadows and woods; a 
wild sort of place, and yet not far from here. 
Only, such a road, rny dear ! Imagine one of the 
Alpine glaciers reproduced in mud. But you will 
not spend much time on it, for they want you to 
come and stay, once for all." 

" Ah," said the Barohess, " they want me to 
come and stay, once for all ? Bon." 

" It 's intensely rural, tremendously natural ; 
and all overhung with this strange white light, this 
far-away blue sky. There 's a big wooden house 
a kind of three-story bungalow ; it looks like 
a magnified Nuremberg toy. There was a gentle- 
man there that made a speech to me about it and 



 

called it a ' venerable mansion ; ' but it looks as if 
it had been built last night." 

"Is it handsome is it elegant?" asked the 
Baroness. 

Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. " It 's 
very clean ! No splendors, no gilding, no troops 
of servants ; rather straight-backed chairs. But 
you might eat off the floors, and you can sit down 
on the stairs." 

" That must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed too, of course." 

" My dear sister," said Felix, " the inhabitants 
are charming." 

" In what style ? " 

" In a style of their own. How shall I de- 
scribe it? It's primitive; it's patriarchal; it's 
the ton of the golden age." 

"And have they nothing golden but their ton? 
Are there no symptoms of wealth ? " 

" I should say there was wealth without symp- 
toms. A plain, homely way of life : nothing for 
show, and very little for what shall I call it ? 
for the senses : but a great aisance, and a lot of 
money, out of sight, that comes forward very 
quietly for subscriptions to institutions, for repairing tenements, for paying doctor's bills ; perhaps even for portioning daughters." 

" And the daughters ? " Madame Miinster de- 
manded. " How many are there ? " 



   

" There are two, Charlotte and Gertrude." 

" Are they pretty ? " 

" One of them," said Felix. 

"Which is that?" 

The young man was silent, looking at his sister. 
" Charlotte," he said at last. 

She looked at him in return. " I see. You are 
in love with Gertrude. They must be Puritans to 
their finger-tips ; anything but gay! " 

" No, they are not gay," Felix admitted. " They 
are sober; they are even severe. They are of a 
pensive cast ; they take things hard. I think there 
is something the matter with them ; they have 
some melancholy memory or some depressing expectation. It 's not the epicurean temperament. 
My uncle, Mr. Wentworth, is a tremendously high-toned old fellow ; he looks as if he were undergoing martyrdom, not by fire, but by freezing. But 
we shall cheer them up ; we shall do them good. 
They will take a good deal of stirring up ; but 
they are wonderfully kind and gentle. And they 
are appreciative. They think one clever ; they 
think one remarkable ! " 

" That is very fine, so far as it goes," said the 
Baroness. " But are we to be shut up to these 
three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young 
women what did you say their names were 
Deborah and Hephzibah ? " 



 

" Oh, no ; there is another little girl, a cousin 
of theirs, a very pretty creature ; a thorough lit- 
tle American. And then there is the son of the 
house." 

"Good! " said the Baroness. "We are coming 
to the gentlemen. What of the son of the house? " 

" I am afraid he gets tipsy." 

" He, then, has the epicurean temperament ! 
How old is he?" 

" He is a boy of twenty ; a pretty young fellow, 
but I am afraid he has vulgar tastes. And then 
there is Mr. Brand a very tall young man, a sort 
of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of 
him, but I don't exactly make him out." 

" And is there nothing," asked the Baroness, 
" between these extremes this mysterious eccle- 
siastic and that intemperate youth ? " 

" Oh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think," said 
the young man, with a nod at his sister, " that you 
will like Mr. Acton." 

" Remember that I am very fastidious," said the 
Baroness. " Has he very good manners ? " 

" He will have them with you. He is a man of 
the world ; he has been to China." 

Madame Minister gave a little laugh. " A man 
of the Chinese world ! He must be very interest- 
ing." 

 



   

" I have an idea that he brought home a fortune," said Felix. 

" That is always interesting. Is he young, good- 
looking, clever ? " 

" He is less than forty ; he has a baldish head ; 
he says witty things. I rather think/' added the 
young man, "that he will admire the Baroness 
Munster." 

" It is very possible,'* said this lady. Her 
brother never knew how she would take things ; 
but shortly afterwards she declared that he had 
made a very pretty description and that on the 
morrow she would go and see for herself. 

They mounted, accordingly, into a great ba- 
rouche a vehicle as to which the Baroness found 
nothing to criticise but the price that was asked 
for it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw 
hat. (At Silberstadt Madame Munster had had 
liveries of yellow and crimson.) They drove into 
the country, and the Baroness, leaning far back 
and swaying her lace-fringed parasol, looked to 
right and to left and surveyed the way-side ob- 
jects. After a while she pronounced them " af- 
freux." Her brother remarked that it was ap- 
parently a country in which the foreground was 
inferior to the plans recul^s : and the Baroness 
rejoined that the landscape seemed to be all fore- 
ground. Felix had fixed with his new friends the 



 

hour at which he should bring his sister ; it was 
four o'clock in the afternoon. The large, clean- 
faced house wore, to his eyes, as the barouche 
drove up to it, a very friendly aspect ; the high, 
slender elms made lengthening shadows in front 
of it. The Baroness descended ; her American 
kinsfolk were stationed in the portico. Felix 
waved his hat to them, and a tall, lean gentleman, 
with a high forehead and a clean shaven face, came 
forward toward the garden gate. Charlotte Went- 
worth walked at his side. Gertrude came behind, 
more slowly. Both of these young ladies wore 
rustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his sister into 
the gate. " Be very gracious," he said to her. 
But he saw the admonition was superfluous. Eugenia was prepared to be gracious as only Eugenia 
could be. Felix knew no keener pleasure than to 
be able to admire his sister unrestrictedly ; for if 
the opportunity was frequent, it was not inveter- 
ate. When she desired to please she was to him, 
as to every one else, the most charming woman in 
the world. Then he forgot that she was ever 
anything else ; that she was sometimes hard and 
perverse ; that he was occasionally afraid of her. 
Now, as she took his arm to pass into the garden, 
he felt that she desired, that she proposed, to 
please, and this situation made him very happy. 
Eugenia would please. 



   

The tall gentleman came to meet her, looking 
very rigid and grave. But it was a rigidity that 
had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth's man- 
ner was pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of 
grand responsibility, of the solemnity of the oc- 
casion, of its being difficult to show sufficient def- 
erence to a lady at once so distinguished and so 
unhappy. Felix had observed on the day before 
his characteristic pallor ; and now he perceived 
that there was something almost cadaverous in his 
uncle's high-featured white face. But so clever 
were this young man's quick sympathies and 
perceptions that he already learned that in these 
semi-mortuary manifestations there was no cause 
for alarm. His light imagination had gained a 
glimpse of Mr. Wentworth's spiritual mechanism, 
and taught him that, the old man being infinitely 
conscientious, the special operation of conscience 
within him announced itself by several of the in- 
dications of physical faintness. 

The Baroness took her uncle's hand, and stood 
looking at him with her ugly face and her beauti- 
ful smile. " Have I done right to come ? " she 
asked. 

" Very right, very right," said Mr. Wentworth, 
solemnly. He had arranged in his mind a little 
speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt 
almost frightened. He had never been looked at 



 

in just that way with just that fixed, intense 
smile by any woman ; and it perplexed and 
weighed upon him, now, that the woman who was 
smiling so and who had instantly given him a 
vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented 
attributes, was his own niece, the child of his own 
father's daughter. The idea that his niece should 
be a German Baroness, married " morganatically " 
to a Prince, had already given him much to think 
about. Was it right, was it just, was it accepta- 
ble ? He always slept badly, and the night be- 
fore he had lain awake much more even than 
usual, asking himself these questions. The strange 
word " morganatic " was constantly in his ears ; 
it reminded him of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom 
he had once known and who had been a bold, unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it was 
his duty, so long as the Baroness looked at him, 
smiling in that way, to meet her glance with his 
own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision; but on this occasion he failed to 
perform his duty to the last. He looked away 
toward his daughters. " We are very glad to see 
you," he had said. " Allow me to introduce my 
daughters Miss Charlotte Went worth, Miss Ger- 
trude Wentworth." 

The Baroness thought she had never seen peo- 
ple less demonstrative. But Charlotte kissed her 



   

and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and 
solemnly. Gertrude seemed to her almost funereal, though Gertrude might have found a source 
of gayety in the fact that Felix, with his mag- 
nificent smile, had been talking to her ; he had 
greeted her as a very old friend. When she 
kissed the Baroness she had tears in her eyes. 
Madame Minister took each of these young women 
by the hand, and looked at them all over. Char- 
lotte thought her very strange-looking and singu- 
larly dressed ; she could not have said whether it 
was well or ill. She was glad, at any rate, that 
they had put on their silk gowns especially 
Gertrude. " My cousins are very pretty," said 
the Baroness, turning her eyes from one to the 
other. " Your daughters are very handsome, sir." 
Charlotte blushed quickly ; she had never yet 
heard her personal -appearance alluded to in a 
loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked away 
not at Felix ; she was extremely pleased. It was 
not the compliment that pleased her ; she did not 
believe it; she thought herself very plain. She 
could hardly have told you the source of her sat- 
isfaction ; it came from something in the way the 
Baroness spoke, and it was not diminished it 
was rather deepened, oddly enough by the young 
girl's disbelief. Mr. Wentworth was silent ; and 
then he asked, formally, " Won't you come into 
the house ? " 



 

" These are not all ; you have some other children," said the Baroness. 

" I have a son," Mr. Went worth answered. 

"And why doesn't he come to meet me?" 
Eugenia cried. " I am afraid he is not so charm- 
ing as his sisters." 

" I don't know ; I will see about it," the old 
man declared. 

" He is rather afraid of ladies," Charlotte said, 
softly. 

" He is very handsome," said Gertrude, as loud 
as she could. 

" We will go in and find him. We will draw 
him out of his cachette." And the Baroness took 
Mr. Wentworth's arm, who was not aware that 
he had offered it to her, and who, as they walked 
toward the house, wondered whether he ought to 
have offered it and whether it was proper for her 
to take it if it had not been offered. " I want to 
know you well," said the Baroness, interrupting 
these meditations, " and I want you to know me." 

" It seems natural that we should know each 
other," Mr. Went worth rejoined. " We are near 
relatives." 

" Ah, there comes a moment in life when one 
reverts, irresistibly, to one's natural ties to one's 
natural affections. You must have found that ! " 
said Eugenia. 



   

Mr. Wentworth had been told the day before 
by Felix that Eugenia was very clever, very brill- 
iant, and the information had held him in some 
suspense. This was the cleverness, he supposed ; 
the brilliancy was beginning. " Yes, the natural 
affections are very strong," he murmured. 

" In some people," the Baroness declared. " Not 
in all." Charlotte was walking beside her ; she 
took hold of her hand again, smiling always. 
" And you, cousine, where did you get that enchanting complexion ? " she went on ; " such lilies 
and roses ? " The roses in poor Charlotte's coun- 
tenance began speedily to predominate over the 
lilies, and she quickened her step and reached the
