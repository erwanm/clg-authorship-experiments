By the terms, the duel was over. But Luigi was 
entirely out of patience, and begged for one more 
exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no fair 
chance, on account of his brother's indelicate be- 
havior. Howard was opposed to granting so un- 
usual a privilege, but the Judge took Luigi's part, 
and added that indeed he himself might fairly be con- 
sidered entitled to another trial, because although 
the proxy on the other side was in no way to blame 
for his (the Judge's) humiliatingly resultless work, 
the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel 
was to blame for it, since if he had played no ad- 
vantages and had held his head still, his proxy 
would have been disposed of early. He added: 

"Count Luigi's request for another exchange is 
another proof that he is a brave and chivalrous 
gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks may 
be accorded him." 

"I thank you most sincerely for this generosity, 
Judge Driscoll," said Luigi, with a polite bow, and 
moving to his place. Then he added — to Angelo, 
' ' Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and 
I'll land him sure!" 

The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their 
sides, the two seconds stood at their official posts, 
the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's rear with his 
instruments and bandages in his hands. The deep 
stillness, the peaceful moonlight, the motionless 
figures, made an impressive picture and the impend- 





 

ing fatal possibilities augmented this impressiveness 
to solemnity. Wilson's hand began to rise — slowly 
— slowly — higher — still higher — in another moment : 

"Boom!" — the first stroke of midnight swung up 
out of the distance; Angelo was off like a deer! 

"Oh, you unspeakable traitor!" wailed his brother, 
as they went soaring over the fence. 

The others stood astonished and gazing; and so 
stood, watching that strange spectacle until dis- 
tance dissolved it and swept it from their view. 
Then they rubbed their eyes like people waking out 
of a dream. 

"Well, I've never seen anything like that be- 
fore!" said the Judge. "Wilson, I am going to 
confess now, that I wasn't quite able to believe in 
that leg business, and had a suspicion that it was a 
put-up convenience between those twins; and when 
Count Angelo fainted I thought I saw the whole 
scheme — thought it was pretext No. i, and would 
be followed by others till twelve o'clock should 
arrive, and Luigi would get off with all the credit of 
seeming to want to fight and yet not have to fight, 
after all. But I was mistaken. His pluck proved 
it. He's a brave fellow and did want to fight." 

"There isn't any doubt about that," said Howard, 
and added, in a grieved tone, "but what an un- 
worthy sort of Christian that Angelo is — I hope and 
believe there are not many like him. It is not right 
to engage in a duel on the Sabbath — I could not ap- 
prove of that myself; but to finish one that has been 
begun — that is a duty, let the day be what it may." 

They strolled along, still wondering, still talking. 





 

"It is a curious circumstance," remarked the 
surgeon, halting Wilson a moment to paste some 
more court-plaster on his chin, which had gone to 
leaking blood again, "that in this duel neither of 
the parties who handled the pistols lost blood, while 
nearly all the persons present in the mere capacity 
of guests got hit. I have not heard of such a thing 
before. Don't you think it unusual?" 

"Yes," said the Judge, "it has struck me as 
peculiar. Peculiar and unfortunate. I was annoyed 
at it, all the time. In the case of Angelo it made 
no great difference, because he was in a measure 
concerned, though not officially; but it troubled me 
to see the seconds compromised, and yet I knew no 
way to mend the matter." 

"There was no way to mend it," said Howard, 
whose ear was being readjusted now by the doctor; 
"the code fixes our place, and it would not have 
been lawful to change it. If we could have stood at 
your side, or behind you, or in front of you, it — 
but it would not have been legitimate and the other 
parties would have had a just right to complain of 
our trying to protect ourselves from danger; in- 
fractions of the code are certainly not permissible in 
any case whatever." 

Wilson offered no remarks. It seemed to him 
that there was very little place here for so much 
solemnity, but he judged that if a duel where nobody 
was in danger or got crippled but the seconds and 
the outsiders had nothing ridiculous about it for 
these gentlemen, his pointing out that feature would 
probably not help them to see it. 





 

He invited them in to take a nightcap, and 
Howard and the Judge accepted, but the doctor 
said he would have to go and see how Angelo's 
principal wound was getting on. 

[It was now Sunday, and in the afternoon Angelo was to be 
received into the Baptist communion by immersion — a doubtful 
prospect, the doctor feared.) 



CHAPTER Vn 

LTJIGI DEFIES GALEN 

WHEN the doctor arrived at Aunt Patsy 
Cooper's house, he found the lights going 
and everybody up and dressed and in a great 
state of solicitude and excitement. The twins were 
stretched on a sofa in the sitting-room, Aunt Patsy 
was fussing at Angelo's arm, Nancy was flying 
around under her commands, the two young boys 
were trying to keep out of the way and always 
getting in it, in order to see and wonder, Rowena 
stood apart, helpless with apprehension and emo- 
tion, and Luigi was growling in unappeasable fury 
over Angelo's shameful flight. 

As has been reported before, the doctor was a 
fool — a kind-hearted and well-meaning one, but 
with no tact; and as he was by long odds the most 
learned physician in the town, and was quite well 
aware of it, and could talk his learning with ease 
and precision, and liked to show off when he had an 
audience, he was sometimes tempted into revealing 
more of a case than was good for the patient. 

He examined Angelo's wound, and was really 
minded to say nothing for once; but Aunt Patsy 
was so anxious and so pressing that he allowed his 
caution to be overcome, and proceeded to empty 
himself as follows, with scientific relish: 





 

"Without going too much into detail, madam — 
for you would probably not understand it, anyway 
— I concede that great care is going to be necessary 
here; otherwise exudation of the esophagus is 
nearly sure to ensue, and this will be followed by 
ossification and extradition of the maxillaris superi- 
oris. which must decompose the granular surfaces of 
the great infusorial ganglionic system, thus obstruct- 
ing the action of the posterior varioloid arteries, and 
precipitating compound strangulated sorosis of the 
valvular tissues, and ending unavoidably in the dis- 
persion and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and 
the consequent embrocation of the bicuspid populo 
redax referendum rotulorum." 

A miserable silence followed. Aunt Patsy's heart 
sank, the pallor of despair invaded her face, she was 
not able to speak ; poor Rowena wrung her hands in 
privacy and silence, and said to herself in the bitter- 
ness of her young grief, "There is no hope — it is 
plain there is no hope"; the good-hearted negro 
wench, Nancy, paled to chocolate, then to orange, 
then to amber, and thought to herself with yearning 
sympathy and sorrow, "Po' thing, he ain' gwyne 
to las' throo de half o' dat"; small Henry choked 
up, and turned his head away to hide his rising 
tears, and his brother Joe said to himself, with a 
sense of loss, "The baptizing's busted, that's sure." 
Luigi was the only person who had any heart to 
speak. He said, a little bit sharply, to the doctor: 

"Well, well, there's nothing to be gained by 
wasting precious time; give him a barrel of pills — 
I'll take them for him." 





 

"You?" asked the doctor. 

"Yes. Did you suppose he was going to take 
them himself?" 

"Why, of course." 

"Well, it's a mistake. He never took a dose of 
medicine in his life. He can't." 

"Well, upon my word, it's the most extraordi- 
nary thing I ever heard of!" 

"Oh," said Aunt Patsy, as pleased as a mother 
whose child is being admired and wondered at, 
"you'll find that there's more about them that's 
wonderful than their just being made in the image 
of God like the rest of His creatures, now you can 
depend on that, I tell you," and she wagged her 
complacent head like one who could reveal marvel- 
ous things if she chose. 

The boy Joe began: 

"Why, ma, they ain't made in the im — " 

"You shut up, and wait till you're asked, Joe. 
I'll let you know when I want help. Are you look- 
ing for something, doctor?" 

The doctor asked for a few sheets of paper and a 
pen, and said he would write a prescription; which 
he did. It was one of Galen's; in fact, it was 
Galen's favorite, and had been slaying people for 
sixteen thousand years. Galen used it for every- 
thing, applied it to everything, said it would remove 
everything, from warts all the way through to lungs 
— and it generally did. Galen was still the only 
medical authority recognized in Missouri; his prac- 
tice was the only practice known to the Missouri 
doctors, and his prescriptions were the only ammu- 





 

nition they carried when they went out for game. 
By and by Dr. Claypool laid down his pen and read 
the result of his labors aloud, carefully and deliber- 
ately, for this battery must be constructed on the 
premises by the family, and mistakes could occur; 
for he wrote a doctor's hand — the hand which from 
the beginning of time has been so disastrous to the 
apothecary and so profitable to the undertaker : 

"Take of afarabocca, henbane, corpobalsamum, 
each two drams and a half: of cloves, opium, 
myrrh, cyperus, each two drams; of opobalsamum, 
Indian leaf, cinnamon, zedoary, ginger, coftus, 
coral, cassia, euphorbium, gum tragacanth, frankin- 
cense, styrax calamita, Celtic, nard, spignel, hart- 
wort, mustard, saxifrage, dill, anise, each one dram; 
of xylaloes, rheum ponticum, alipta, moschata, 
castor, spikenard, galangals, opoponax, anacardium, 
mastich, brimstone, peony, eringo, pulp of dates, 
red and white hermodactyls, roses, thyme, acorns, 
pennyroyal, gentian, the bark of the root of man- 
drake, germander, valerian, bishop's-weed, bay- 
berries, long and white pepper, xylobalsamum, 
carnabadium, macedonian, parsley seeds, lovage, the 
seeds of rue, and sinon, of each a dram and a half ; 
of pure gold, pure silver, pearls not perforated, the 
blatta byzantina, the bone of the stag's heart, of 
each the quantity of fourteen grains of wheat; of 
sapphire, emerald and jasper stones, each one dram; 
of hazel-nuts, two drams; of pellitory of Spain, shav- 
ings of ivory, calamus odoratus, each the quantity 
of twenty-nine grains of wheat; of honey or sugar 
a sufficient quantity. Boil down and skim off." 


"There," he said, "that will fix the patient; give 
his brother a dipperful every three-quarters of an 
hour—" 

— "while he survives," muttered Lugui — 

— "and see that the room is kept wholesomely 
hot, and the doors and windows closed tight. Keep 
Count Angelo nicely covered up with six or seven 
blankets, and when he is thirsty — which will be 
frequently — moisten a rag in the vapor of the tea- 
kettle and let his brother suck it. When he is 
hungry — which will also be frequently — he must 
not be humored oftener than every seven or eight 
hours ; then toast part of a cracker until it begins to 
brown, and give it to his brother." 

"That is all very well, as far as Angelo is con- 
cerned," said Luigi, "but what am I to eat?" 

"I do not see that there is anything the matter 
with you," the doctor answered, "you may, of 
course, eat what you please." 

"And also drink what I please, I suppose?" 

"Oh, certainly — at present. When the violent 
and continuous perspiring has reduced your strength, 
I shall have to reduce your diet, of course, and also 
bleed you, but there is no occasion for that yet 
awhile." He turned to Aunt Patsy and said : "He 
must be put to bed, and sat up with, and tended 
with the greatest care, and not allowed to stir for 
several days and nights." 

"For one, I'm sacredly thankful for that," said 
Luigi, "it postpones the funeral — I'm not to be 
drowned to-day, anyhow." 

Angelo said quietly to the doctor: 
 

"I will cheerfully submit to all your require- 
ments, sir, up to two o'clock this afternoon, and 
will resume them after three, but cannot be confined 
to the house during that intermediate hour." 

"Why, may I ask?" 

"Because I have entered the Baptist communion, 
and by appointment am to be baptized in the river 
at that hour." 

"Oh, insanity! — it cannot be allowed!" 

Angelo answered with placid firmness: 

"Nothing shall prevent it, if I am alive." 

"Why, consider, my dear sir, in your condition 
it might prove fatal." 

A tender and ecstatic smile beamed from Angelo's 
eyes, and he broke forth in a tone of joyous fervency : 

"Ah, how blessed it would be to die for such a 
cause — it would be martyrdom!" 

"But your brother — consider your brother; you 
would be risking his life, too." 

"He risked mine an hour ago," responded Angelo, 
gloomily; "did he consider me ? " A thought swept 
through his mind that made him shudder. "If I 
had not run, I might have been killed in a duel on 
the Sabbath day, and my soul would have been lost 
—lost." 

"Oh, don't fret, it wasn't in any danger," said 
Luigi, irritably; "they wouldn't waste it for a little 
thing like that; there's a glass case all ready for it 
in the heavenly museum, and a pin to stick it up 
with." 

Aunt Patsy was shocked, and said: 

"Looy, Looy! — don't talk so, dear!" 





 

Rowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's un- 
feeling words, and she murmured to herself, "Oh, 
if I but had the dear privilege of protecting and 
defending him with my weak voice! — but alas! this 
sweet boon is denied me by the cruel conventions of 
social intercourse." 

"Get their bed ready," said Aunt Patsy to Nancy, 
"and shut up the windows and doors, and light 
their candles, and see that you drive all the mos- 
quitoes out of their bar, and make up a good fire in 
their stove, and carry up some bags of hot ashes 
to lay to his feet — " 

— "and a shovel of fire for his head, and a mus- 
tard plaster for his neck, and some gum shoes for 
his ears," Luigi interrupted, with temper; and 
added, to himself, "Damnation, I'm going to be 
roasted alive, I just know it!" 

"Why, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw such 
a fractious thing. A body would think you didn't 
care for your brother." 

"I don't — to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I was 
glad the drowning was postponed a minute ago, but 
I'm not now. No, that is all gone by; I want to 
be drowned." 

"You'll bring a judgment on yourself just as sure 
as you live, if you go on like that. Why, I nevei 
heard the beat of it. Now, there — there! you've 
said enough. Not another word out of you — I 
won't have it!" 

"But, Aunt Patsy—" 

"Luigi! Didn't you hear what I told you?" 

"But, Aunt Patsy, I — why, I'm not going to 



Bet my heart and lungs afloat in that pail of sewage 
which this criminal here has been prescri — " 

"Yes, you are, too. You are going to be good, 
and do everything I tell you, like a dear," and she 
tapped his cheek affectionately with her finger. 
"Rowena, take the prescription and go in the 
kitchen and hunt up the things and lay them out 
for me. I'll sit up with my patient the rest of the 
night, doctor; I can't trust Nancy, she couldn't 
make Luigi take the medicine. Of course, you'll 
drop in again during the day. Have you got any 
more directions?" 

"No, I believe not, Aunt Patsy. If I don't get 
in earlier, I'll be along by early candle-light, anyway. 
Meantime, don't allow him to get out of his bed." 

Angelo said, with calm determination: 

"I shall be baptized at two o'clock. Nothing 
but death shall prevent me." 

The doctor said nothing aloud, but to himself he 
said : 

"Why, this chap's got a manly side, after all! 
Physically he's a coward, but morally he's a lion. 
I'll go and tell the others about this; it will raise 
him a good deal in their estimation — and the public 
will follow their lead, of course." 

Privately, Aunt Patsy applauded too, and was 
proud of Angelo's courage in the moral field as she 
was of Luigi's in the field of honor. 

The boy Henry was troubled, but the boy Joe 
said, inaudibly, and gratefully, "We're all hunky, 
after all; and no postponement on account of the 
weather." 





CHAPTER VIII 

BAPTISM OF THE BETTER HALF 

BY nine o'clock the town was humming" with the 
news of the midnight duel, and there were but 
two opinions about it: one, that Luigi's pluck in 
the field was most praiseworthy and Angelo's flight 
most scandalous; the other, that Angelo's courage 
in flying the field for conscience' sake was as fine 
and creditable as was Luigi's in holding the field in 
the face of the bullets. The one opinion was held 
by half of the town, the other one was maintained 
by the other half. The division was clean and 
exact, and it made two parties, an Angelo party 
and a Luigi party. The twins had suddenly become 
popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson, and 
haloed with a glory as intense as his. The children 
talked the duel all the way to Sunday-school, their 
elders talked it all the way to church, the choir dis- 
cussed it behind their red curtain, it usurped the 
place of pious thought in the "nigger gallery." 

By noon the doctor had added the news, and 
spread it, that Count Angelo, in spite of his wound 
and all warnings and supplications, was resolute in 
his determination to be baptized at the hour ap- 
pointed. This swept the town like wildfire, and 
mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the Angelo 
faction, who said, "If any doubted that it was 





 

moral courage that took him from the field, what 
have they to say now!" 

Still the excitement grew. All the morning it was 
traveling countryward, toward all points of the 
compass; so, whereas before only the farmers and 
their wives were intending to come and witness the 
remarkable baptism, a general holiday was now 
proclaimed and the children and negroes admitted 
to the privileges of the occasion. All the farms for 
ten miles around were vacated, all the converging 
roads emptied long processions of wagons, horses, 
and yeomanry into the town. The pack and cram 
of people vastly exceeded any that had ever been 
seen in that sleepy region before. The only thing 
that had ever even approached it, was the time 
long gone by, but never forgotten, nor even referred 
to without wonder and pride, when two circuses and 
a Fourth of July fell together. But the glory of that 
occasion was extinguished now for good. It was 
but a freshet to this deluge. 

The great invasion massed itself on the river-bank 
and waited hungrily for the immense event . Waited , 
and wondered if it would really happen, or if the 
twin who was not a "professor" would stand out 
and prevent it. 

But they were not to be disappointed. Angelo 
was as good as his word. He came attended by an 
escort of honor composed of several hundred of the 
best citizens, all of the Angelo party ; and when the 
immersion was finished they escorted him back home : 
and would even have carried him on their shoulders, 
but that people might think they were carrying Luigi. 

Far into the night the citizens continued to discuss 
and wonder over the strangely mated pair of inci- 
dents that had distinguished and exalted the past 
twenty-four hours above any other twenty-four in the 
history of their town for picturesqueness and splen- 
did interest ; and long before the lights were out and 
burghers asleep it had been decided on all hands that 
in capturing these twins Dawson's Landing had drawn 
a prize in the great lottery of municipal fortune. 

At midnight Angelo was sleeping peacefully. His 
immersion had not harmed him, it had merely made 
him wholesomely drowsy, and he had been dead 
asleep many hours now. It had made Luigi drowsy, 
too, but he had got only brief naps, on account of 
his having to take the medicine every three-quarters 
of an hour — and Aunt Betsy Hale was there to see 
that he did it. When he complained and resisted, 
she was quietly firm with him, and said in a low 
voice : 

"No — no, that won't do; you mustn't talk, and 
you mustn't retch and gag that way, either — you'll 
wake up your poor brother." 

"Well, what of it, Aunt Betsy, he—" 

" 'Sh-h! Don't make a noise, dear. You mustn't 
forget that your poor brother is sick and — " 

"Sick, is he? Well, I wish I—" 

"'Sh-h-h! Will you be quiet, Luigi! Here, now, 
take the rest of it — don't keep me holding the dip- 
per all night. I declare if you haven't left a good 
fourth of it in the bottom! Come — that's a good 
boy." 

"Aunt Betsy, don't make me! I feel like I've 

swallowed a cemetery; I do, indeed. Do let me 
rest a little — just a little; I can't take any more of 
the devilish stuff now." 

"Luigil Using such language here, and him just 
baptized! Do you want the roof to fall on you?" 

"I wish to goodness it would!" 

"Why, you dreadful thing! I've a good notion 
to — let that blanket alone; do you want your 
brother to catch his death?" 

"Aunt Betsy, I've got to have it off, I'm being 
roasted alive; nobody could stand it — you couldn't 
yourself." 

"Now, then, you're sneezing again — I just ex- 
pected it." 

"Because I've caught a cold in my head. I 
always do, when I go in the water with my clothes 
on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I 
think it was a shame to serve me so." 

"Luigi, you are unreasonable; you know very 
well they couldn't baptize him dry. I should think 
you would be willing to undergo a little inconven- 
ience for your brother's sake." 

"Inconvenience! Now how you talk, Aunt Betsy. 
I came as near as anything to getting drowned — 
you saw that yourself; and do you call this incon- 
venience? — the room shut up as tight as a drum, 
and so hot the mosquitoes are trying, to get out; 
and a cold in the head, and dying for sleep and no 
chance to get any on account of this infamous 
medicine that that assassin prescri — " 

"There, you're sneezing again. I'm going down 
and mix some more of this truck for you, dear." 





CHAPTER DC 

THE DRINKLESS DRUNK 

DURING Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the 
twins grew steadily worse; but then the doctor 
was summoned South to attend his mother's funeral, 
and they got well in forty-eight hours. They ap- 
peared on the street on Friday, and were welcomed 
with enthusiasm by the new-born parties, the Luigi 
and Angelo factions. The Luigi faction carried its 
Strength into the Democratic party, the Angelo fac- 
tion entered into a combination with the Whigs. 
The Democrats nominated Luigi for alderman under 
the new city government, and the Whigs put up 
Angelo against him. The Democrats nominated 
Pudd'nhead Wilson for mayor, and he was left 
alone in this glory, for the Whigs had no man who 
was willing to enter the lists against such a formi- 
dable opponent. No politician had scored such a 
compliment as this before in the history of the 
Mississippi Valley. 

The political campaign in Dawson's Landing 
opened in a pretty warm fashion, and waxed hotter 
every week. Luigi's whole heart was in it, and even 
Angelo developed a surprising amount of interest — 
which was natural, because he was not merely repre- 
senting Whigism, a matter of no consequence to 
him, but he was representing something immensely 





 

finer and greater — to wit, Reform. In him was 
centered the hopes of the whole reform element of 
the town; he was the chosen and admired cham- 
pion of every clique that had a pet reform of any 
sort or kind at heart. He was president of the great 
Teetotalers' Union, its chiefest prophet and mouth- 
piece. 

But as the canvass went on, troubles began to 
spring up all around — troubles for the twins, and 
through them for all the parties and segments and 
factions of parties. Whenever Luigi had possession 
of the legs, he carried Angelo to balls, rum shops, 
Sons of Liberty parades, horse-races, campaign 
riots, and everywhere else that could damage him 
with his party and the church; and when it was 
Angelo's week he carried Luigi diligently to all 
manner of moral and religious gatherings, doing his' 
best to regain the ground he had lost before. As 
a result of these double performances, there was a 
storm blowing all the time, an ever-rising storm, 
too — a storm of frantic criticism of the twins, and 
rage over their extravagant, incomprehensible con- 
duct. 

Luigi had the final chance. The legs Were his for 
the closing week of the canvass. He led his brother 
a fearful dance. 

But he saved his best card for the very eve of the 
election. There was to be a grand turnout of the 
Teetotalers' Union that day, and Angelo was to 
march at the head of the procession and deliver a 
great oration afterward. Luigi drank a couple of 
glasses of whisky — which steadied his nerves and 
clarified his mind, but made Angelo drunk. Every- 
body who saw the march, saw that the Champion of 
the Teetotalers was half seas over, and noted also 
that his brother, who made no hypocritical preten- 
sions to extra temperance virtues, was dignified and 
sober. This eloquent fact could not be unfruitful at 
the end of a hot political canvass. At the mass- 
meeting Angelo tried to make his great temperance 
oration, but was so discommoded by hiccoughs and 
thickness of tongue that he had to give it up; then 
drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped 
against Luigi's and he went to sleep. Luigi apolo- 
gized for him, and was going on to improve his op- 
portunity with an appeal for a moderation of what 
he called "the prevailing teetotal madness," but 
persons in the audience began to howl and throw 
things at him, and then the meeting rose in wrath 
and chased him home. 

This episode was a crusher for Angelo in another 
way. It destroyed his chances with Rowena. Those 
chances had been growing, right along, for two 
months. Rowena had partly confessed that she 
loved him, but wanted time to consider. Now the 
tender dream was ended, and she told him so the 
moment he was sober enough to understand. She 
said she would never marry a man who drank. 

"But I don't drink," he pleaded. 

"That is nothing to the point," she said, coldly, 
"you get drunk, and that is worse." 

(There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here, which 
ended as reported in a previous note.] 





CHAPTER X 

SO THEY HANGED LUIGI 

DAWSON'S LANDING had a week of repose, 
after the election, and it needed it, for the 
frantic and variegated nightmare which had tor- 
mented it all through the preceding week had left it 
limp, haggard, and exhausted at the end. It got the 
week of repose because Angelo had the legs, and 
was in too subdued a condition to want to go out 
and mingle with an irritated community that had 
come to distrust and detest him because there was 
such a lack of harmony between his morals, which 
were confessedly excellent, and his methods of 
illustrating them, which were distinctly damnable. 
The new city officers were sworn in on the follow- 
ing Monday — at least all but Luigi. There was a 
complication in his case. His election was con- 
ceded, but he could not sit in the board of aldermen 
without his brother, and his brother could not sit 
there because he was not a member. There seemed 
to be no way out of the difficulty but to carry the 
matter into the courts, so this was resolved upon. 
The case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due 
course the time arrived. In the mean time the city 
government had been at a standstill, because with- 
out Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, 
whereas with him the liquor interest — the richest in 

the political field — would have one majority. But 
the court decided that Angelo could not sit in the 
board with him, either in public or executive ses- 
sions, and at the same time forbade the board to
