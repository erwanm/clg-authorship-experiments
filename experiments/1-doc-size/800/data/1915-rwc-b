Then, tier on tier, the bells of the carillon, 
fixed to their great beams, appeared above 
them a shadowy, bewildering wilderness of 
bells, rising, rank above rank, until they van 
ished in the darkness overhead. Beside them, 
almost touching them, loomed the great bell 
Clovis, a gigantic mass bulking enormously 
in that shadowy place. 

A sonorous wind flowed through the open 
tower, eddying among the bells a strong, 
keen night wind blowing from the north. 

The airman walked to the south parapet 
and looked down. Below him in the starlight, 
like an indistinct map spread out, lay the 
Nivelle redoubt and the trench with its 
gabions, its sand bags, its timbers, its dugouts. 

Very far away to the southeast they could 
see the glare of rockets and exploding shells, 
but the sound of the bombardment did not 









reach them. North, a single searchlight 
played and switched across the clouds; west, 
all was dark. 

"They'll arrive just before dawn," said the 
airman, placing his sack of bombs on the 
pavement under the parapet. "Come, little 
bell-mistress, take me to see your keyboard." 

"It is below a few steps. This way if 
you will follow me " 

She turned to the stone stairs again, de 
scended a dozen steps, opened a door on a 
narrow landing. 

And there, in the starlight, he saw the key 
board and the bewildering maze of wires run 
ning up and branching like a huge web toward 
the tiers of bells above. 

He looked at the keyboard curiously. The 
little mistress of the bells displayed the two 
wooden gloves with which she encased her 
hands when she played the carillon. 

"It would be impossible for one to play 
unless one's hands are armoured," she ex 
plained. 

"It is almost a lost art," he mused aloud. 

" this playing the carillon this wonderful 

i 





bell-music of the middle ages. There are few 
great bell-masters in this day." 

"Few," she said dreamily. 

"And" he turned and stared at her "few 
mistresses of the bells, I imagine." 

"I think I am the only one in France or in 
Flanders. . . . And there are few carillons 
left. The Huns are battering them down. 
Towers of the ancient ages are falling every 
where in Flanders and in France under their 
shell fire. Very soon there will be no more 
of the old carillons left; no more bell-music 
in the world." She sighed heavily. "It is a 
pity." 

She seated herself at the keyboard. 

"Dare I play?" she asked, looking up over 
her shoulder. 

"No; it would only mean a shell from the 
Huns." 

She nodded, laid the wooden gloves beside 
her and let her delicate hands wander over 
the mute keys. 

Leaning beside her the airman quietly ex 
plained the plan they were to follow. 

"With dawn they will come creeping into 









Nivelle the Huns," he said. "I have one of 
their officers uniforms in that bundle above. 
I shall try to pass as a general officer. You 
see, I speak German. My education was 
partly ruined in Germany. So I'll get on very 
well, I expect. 

"And directly under us is the trench and 
the main redoubt. They'll occupy that first 
thing. They'll swarm there the whole trench 
will be crawling with them. They'll install 
their gas cylinders at once, this wind being 
their wind. 

"But with sunrise the wind changes and 
whether it changes or not, I don't care," he 
added. "I've got them at last where I want 
them." 

The girl looked up at him. He smiled that 
terrifying smile of his: 

"With the explosion of my first bomb among 
their gas cylinders you are to start these bells 
above us. Are you afraid?" 

"No." 

"You are to play La Brabanc,onne.* That 
is the signal to our trenches." 

"I have often played it," she said coolly. 


 



"Not in the teeth of a barbarian army. Not 
in the faces of a murderous soldiery." 

The girl sat quite still for a few moments; 
then looking up at him, and very pale in the 
starlight : 

"Do you think they will tear me to pieces, 
monsieur!" 

He said: 

"I mean to hold those stairs with my sack 
of bombs until our people enter the trenches. 
If they can do it in an hour we will be all 
right." 

"Yes." 

"It is only a half -hour affair from our 
salient. I allow our people an hour." 

"Yes." 

"But if, even now, you had rather go 
back -- " 



"There is no disgrace in going back." 
"You said once, anybody can weep for 
friend and country. Few avenge either. I 
am happy to be among the few." 
He nodded. After a moment he said: 
"I'll bet you something. My country is all 









right, but it's sick. It's got a nauseous dose 
of verbiage to spew up something it's swal 
lowed something about being too proud to 
fight. . . . My brother and I couldn't stand 
it, so we came to France. . . . He was in the 
photo air service. He was in mufti and 
about two miles up, I believe. Six Huns went 
for him. . . . And winged him. He had to 
land behind their lines. ... In mufti. . . . 
"Well I've never found courage to hear the 
details. I can't stand them yet." 

"Your brother is dead, monsieur?" she 
asked timidly. 

"Oh, yes. "With circumstances. "Well, then 
after that, from an ordinary, commonplace 
man I became a machine for the extermination 
of vermin. That's all I am an animated maga 
zine of Persian powder or I do it in any 
handy way. It's not a sporting proposition, 
you see, just get rid of them any old way. 
You don't understand, do you?" 

"A little." 

"But it's slow work slow work," he mut 
tered vaguely, " and the world is crawling 
crawling with them. But if God guides my 





 



bomb this time and if I hit one of their gas 
cylinders that ought to be worth while." 

In the starlight his features became tense 
and terrible; she shivered in her threadbare 
jacket. 

After a few moments silence he went away 
up the steps to put on his German uniform. 
When he descended again she had a troubled 
question for him to answer: 

"But how shall you account for me, a French 
girl, monsieur, if they come to the belfry f" 

A heavy flush darkened his face: 

"Little mistress of the bells, I shall pretend 
to be what the Huns are. Do you know how 
they treat French women?" 

"I have heard," she said faintly. 

"Then if they come and find you here as 
my prisoner they will think they under 
stand." 

The colour flamed in her face and she bowed 
it, resting her elbows on the keyboard. 

"Come," he said, "don't be distressed. Does 
it matter what a Hun thinks? Come; let's 
be cheerful. Can you hum for me La Bra- 
bangonne ?" 









She did not reply. 

"Well, never mind," he said. "But it's a 
grand battle anthem. . . . We Americans have 
one. . . . It's out of fashion. And after all, 
I had rather hear La Brabangonne when the 
time comes. . . . What a terrible admission! 
But what Americans have done to my country 
is far more terrible. The nation's sick sick! 
... I prefer La Brabangonne for the time 
being." 

The Prussians entered Nivelle a little be 
fore dawn. The airman had been watching 
the street below. Down there in the slight 
glow from the cinders of what once had been 
a cottage a cat had been squatting, staring 
at the bed of coals, as though she were once 
more installed upon the family hearthstone. 

Then something unseen as yet by the air 
man attracted the animal's attention. Alert, 
crouching, she stared down the vista of dark, 
deserted houses, then turned and fled like a 
ghost. 

For a long while the airman perceived 
nothing. Suddenly close to the house facades 





 



on either side of the street, shadowy forms 
came gliding forward. 

They passed the glowing embers and went 
on toward Sainte-Lesse ; jagers, with knap 
sacks on back and rifles trailing; and on their 
heads oddly shaped pot helmets with battered 
looking visors. 

One or two motorcyclists followed, whiz 
zing through the desolate street and into the 
country beyond. 

After a few minutes, out of the throat of 
the darkness emerged a solid column of infan 
try. In a moment, beneath the bell tower, the 
ground was swarming with Huns; every inch 
of the earth became infested with them ; fields, 
hedges, alleys crawled alive with Germans. 
They overran every road, every street, every 
inch of open country; their wagons choked the 
main thoroughfare, they were already estab 
lishing themselves in the redoubt below, in the 
trench, running in and out of dugouts and all 
over scarp, counter-scarp, parades and para 
pet, ant-like in energy, busy with machine gun, 
trench mortar, installing telephones, search 
lights, periscopes, machine guns. 









Automobiles arrived two armoured cars 
and grey passenger machines in which there 
were officers. 

The airman laid his hand on Maryette's arm. 

"Little bell-mistress," he said, "German offi 
cers are coming into the tower. I want them 
to find you in my arms when they come up 
into this belfry. Understand me, and forgive 
me." 

"I understand," she whispered. 

"Play your part bravely. "Will you?" 

"Yes." 

He put his arms around her; they stood 
rigid, listening. 

"Now!" he whispered, and drew her close, 
kissing her. 

Spurred boots clattered on the stone floor: 

"Herr Je!" exclaimed an astonished voice. 
Somebody laughed. But the airman coolly 
pushed the girl aside, and as the faint grey 
light of dawn fell on his field uniform bearing 
the ribbon of the iron cross, two pairs of 
spurred heels hastily clinked together and two 
hands flew to the oddly shaped helmet visors. 

"Also!" exclaimed the airman in a mincing 





Berlin accent. "When I require a corps of 
observers I usually send my aide. That being 
now quite perfectly understood, you gentlemen 
will give yourselves the trouble to descend 
as you have come. Further, you will place a 
sentry at the tower door, and inform enquirers 
that General Count von Gierdorff and his 
staff are occupying the Nivelle belfry for pur 
poses of observation." 

The astounded officers saluted steadily; and 
if they imagined that the mythical staff of this 
general officer was clustered aloft somewhere 
up there where the bells hung it was impossi 
ble to tell by the strained expressions on their 
wooden countenances. 

However, it was evidently perfectly plain 
to them what the high Excellent was about in 
this vaulted room where wires led aloft to 
an unseen carillon on the landing in the bel 
fry above. 

The airman nodded; they went. And when 
their clattering steps echoed far below on the 
spiral stone stairs, the airman motioned to 
the little bell-mistress. She followed him up 
the short flight to where the bells hung. 









"We're in for it now," he said. "If High 
Command conies into this place to investigate 
then I shall have to hold those stairs. . . . 
It's growing quite light in the east. Which 
way is the wind?" 

"North," she said in a steady voice. She 
was terribly pale. 

He went to the parapet and looked over, 
half wondering, perhaps, whether he would 
receive a rifle shot through the head. 

Far below at the foot of the bell-tower 
the dimly discerned Nivelle redoubt, swarming 
with men, was being armed; and, to the south, 
wired he thought, but could not see dis 
tinctly. 

Then, as the dusk of early dawn grew 
greyer, the first rifle shots rattled out in 
the west. The French salient was saluting 
the wire-stringers. 

Back under shelter they tumbled; whistles 
sounded distantly; a trench mortar crashed; 
then the accentless tattoo of machine guns 
broke from every emplacement. 

"The east is turning a little yellow," he said 
calmly. "I believe this matter is going through. 





Toss some dust into the air. Which way?" 

"North," said the girl. 

"Good. I think they're placing their cylin 
ders. I think I can see them laying their coils. 
I'm certain of it. What luck!" 

The airman was becoming excited and his 
voice trembled a little with the effort to con 
trol it. 

"It's growing pink in the east. Try a hand 
ful of dust again," he suggested almost gaily. 

"North," she said briefly, watching the dust 
aloft. 

"Luck's with us! Look at the east! If 
their High Command keeps his nose out of 
this place! if he does I Look at the east, lit 
tle bell-mistress ! It's all gold ! There's pink 
up higher. I can see a faint tinge of blue, 
too. Can you?" 

"I think so." 

A minute dragged like a year in prison. 
Then: 

"Try the wind again," he said in a strained 
voice. 

"North." 

"Oh, luck ! Luck !" he muttered, slinging his 









sack of bombs over his shoulder. "We've 
got them! We've certainly got them! What's 
that! An airplane! Look, little girl one of 
our planes is up. There's another! Which 
way is the wind?" 

"North." 

"Got em!" he snapped between his teeth. 
"Bun over to the stairs. Listen! Is anybody 
coming up?" 

"I can hear nothing." 

"Stand there and listen. Never mind the 
row the guns are making; listen for some 
body on the stairs. Look how light it's get- 
ting! The sun will push up before many 
minutes. We've got em! Got em! W^et 
your finger and try the wind!" 

"North." 

"North here, too. What do you know about 
that! Luck! Luck's with us! And we've got 
em !" he lifted his clenched hand and 
laughed at her. "Like that!" he said, his blue 
eyes blazing. "They're getting ready to gas 
below. Look at em! Glory to God! I can 
see two cylinders directly under me. They remanning the nozzles ! Every man is masking 





 



at Ms post! Anybody on the stairs! Any 
sound!" 

"None." 

"Are you certain!" 

"It is as still as death below." 

"Try the dust. The wind's changing, I 
think. Quick! Which way?" 

"West." 

"Oh, glory! Glory to God! They feel it 
below! They know. The wind has changed. 
Off came their respirators. No gas this morn 
ing, eh! Yes, by God, there will be gas enough 
for all !" 

He caught up a bomb, leaned over the para 
pet, held it aloft, poised, aiming steadily for 
one second of concentrated coordination of 
mind and muscle. Then straight down he 
launched it. The cylinder beneath him was 
shattered and a green geyser of gas burst from 
it deluging the trench. 

Already a second bomb followed the first, 
then another, and then a third; and with the 
last report another cylinder in the trench be 
low burst into thick green billows of death and 
flowed over the ground, west. 









Two more bombs whirled down, bursting on 
a machine gun; then the airman turned with a 
cry of triumph, and at the same instant the 
sun rose above the hills and flung a golden 
ray straight across his face. 

To Maryette the man stood transfigured, 
like the Blazing Guardian of the Flaming 
Sword. 

"King out your Brabanc.onne !" he cried. 
"Let the Huns hear the war song of the land 
they've trampled! Now! Little bell-mistress, 
arm your white hands with your wooden gloves 
and make this old carillon speak in brass and 
iron !" 

He caught her by the arm; they ran down 
the short flight of steps; she drew on her 
wooden gloves and sprang to the keyboard. 

"I'll hold the stairs!" he cried. "I can 
hold these stairs for an hour against the 
whole world in arms. Now, then! The Bra 
banc.onne !" 

Above the roaring confusion and the explo 
sions far below, from high up in the sky a 
clear bell note floated as though out of 
Heaven itself another, others, crystalline 





BRABANCONNE 



clear, imperious, filling all the sky with their 
amazing and terrible beauty. 

The mistress of the bells struck the key 
board with armoured hands beautiful, slen 
der, avenging hands; the bells above her 
crashed out into the battle-song of Flanders, 
filling sky and earth with its splendid defi 
ance of the Hun. 

The airman, bomb in hand, stood at the 
head of the stone stairs; the ancient tower 
rocked with the fiercely magnificent anthem 
of revolt the war cry of a devastated land 
the land that died to save the world the 
martyr, Belgium, still prone in the deathly 
trance awaiting her certain resurrection. 

The rising sun struck the tower where 
three score ancient bells poured from metal 
throats their heavenly summons to battle! 

The Hun heard it, tumbling, clawing, stran 
gling below in the hellish vapours of his own 
death-fog; and now, from the rear his sky- 
guns hurled shrapnel at the carillon in the 
belfry of Nivelle. 

Clouds possessed the tower soft, white, 
fleecy clouds rolling, unfolding, floating about 









the ancient buttresses and gargoyles. An iron 
hail rained on slate and parapet and resound 
ing bell-metal. But the bells pealed and pealed 
in clear-voiced beauty, and Clovis, the great 
iron giant, hung, scarcely sonorous under the 
shrapnel rain. 

Suddenly there were bayonets on the stairs 
the clatter of heavy feet alien faces on the 
threshold. Then a bomb flew, and the terrible 
crash cleared the stairs. 

Twice more the clatter came with the clank 
of bayonets and guttural cries; but both died 
out in the infernal roar of the grenades explod 
ing inside that stony spiral. And no more 
bayonets flickered on the stairs. 

The airman, frozen to a statue, listened. 
Again and again he thought he could hear 
bugles, but the roar from below blotted out 
the distant call. 

"Little bell-mistress !" 

She turned her head, her hands still striking 
the keyboard. He spoke through the confu 
sion of the place: 

"Sound the tocsin!" 

Then Clovis thundered from the belfry like 





LA BRABAN^ONNE" 



a great gun fired, booming out over the world. 
Around the iron colossus shrapnel swept in 
gusts; Clovis thundered on, annihilating all 
sound except his own tremendous voice, heed 
less of shell and bullet, disdainful of the hell's 
shambles below, where masked French infantry 
were already leaping the parapets of Nivelle 
Redoubt into the squirming masses below. 

The airman shouted at her through the 
tumult : 

"They murdered my brother. Did I tell 
you? They hacked him to slivers with their 
bayonets. I've settled the reckoning down in 
the gas there their own green gas, damn 
them! You don't understand what I say, do 
you? He was my brother " 

A frightful explosion blew in the oubliette; 
the room rattled and clattered with shrapnel. 

The airman swayed where he stood in the 
swirling smoke, lurched up against the stone 
coping, slid down to his knees. 

When his eyes opened the little bell-mistress 
was bending over him. 

"They got me," he gasped. All the front of 
his tunic was sopping red. 





"They said it meant the cross if I made 
good. . . . Are you hurt?" 

"Oh, no!" she whispered. "But you 

"Go on and play!" he whispered with a ter 
rible effort. 

"But you " 

"The Brabangonne ! Quick!" 

She went, whimpering. Standing before the 
keyboard she pulled on her wooden gloves and 
struck the keys. 

Out over the infernal uproar below pealed 
the bells ; the morning sky rang with the noble 
summons to all brave men. Once more the 
ancient tower trembled with the mighty out- 
crash of the battle hymn. 

With the last note she turned and looked 
down at him where he lay against the wpU. He 
opened his glazing eyes and tried to smile at 
her. 

"Bully," he whispered. "Could you recite 
the words to me just so I could hear them 
on my way West?" 

She left the keyboard, came and dropped 
on her knees beside him; and closing her eyes 
to check the tears sang in a low, tremulous, 





 



girlish voice, De Lonlay's words, to the battle 
anthem of revolution. 

"Bully," he sighed. And spoke no more on 
earth. 

But the little mistress of the bells did not 
know his soul had passed. 

And the French officer who came leaping up 
the stairs, pistol lifted, halted in astonishment 
to see a dead man lying beside a sack of
