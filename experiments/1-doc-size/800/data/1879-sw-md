" Come, child, quick ! I am in a fever to see 
how it will look on you, and if it is all right." 

" What dress, Caroline ? " 

My sister did not answer, and really she had 
small need ; for as she lifted the cover of the great 
square box, which the girl had untied, there came 
to view such a mass of white, gauzy, fleecy drapery, 
with lace and flowers here and there, that it could 
mean only one thing. 

" Have you sent for a dress for me, Caroline ? 



 

I asked dismayed; for I owned no relationship of 
fitness between that mass of showy material and 
me for whom it was destined. But my sister would 
not waste words. She began to take off my morning dress, in order to trying the new one on ; nor 
rested, till she had donned it and fastened it and 
arranged it, and finished by crowning me with a 
wreath of shining green leaves. I looked at my 
self then in a cheval glass, and Caroline looked 
at me. 

" You will do " said she contentedly. 

" Do you think it so ? " I asked. 

" Don't you like the effect ? " 

I was silent, gazing at the apparition in the glass. 

"You are just lovely," said my sister; "and you 
know it. you know it; you dear little quiet 
mouse, you ! And your dress suits you, too." 

"But " 

" You need not bring up your dear little grand 
motherly scruples. The cost is nothing, child; and 
Sandie thinks no more of it than I do. You are 
his sister now, besides, you know." 

" I am very glad he feels so. But, Caroline, I do 
think it is money thrown away." 

"I'll throw it away, then," said she. "I don't 
care, if you catch it." 

" I am not thinking so much of the money " 

"What are you thinking of ? Do you see how 
charming that wreath is in your hair ? and your 
hair is beautiful under it. Your hair is a great 
beauty, Desire; it is finer than Olive's. And you 




know as well as I do, for you have eyes, that this 
dress becomes you. My dear, there is a great deal 
in dress. The men do not know what it is that 
catches them, but they are caught ; and they have 
simply no idea how largely the net is wrought of 
lace and ribband that has taken them prisoner." 

"But, Caroline, I do not want to catch anybody." 

" Of course not. They will be caught quite with 
out your volition." 

I looked at the figure in the cheval glass, and 
did not like it. I do not mean I did not like the 
figure. 

"Caroline, I should be better pleased with myself I should feel more like myself if you would 
let me wear that white muslin again." 

"That you wore last week? Nonsense. It is 
good always to give people a variety of impressions. 
I think you are charming so." 

" I do not see, if people want to meet and talk 
to each other, why they cannot do it in an ordi 
nary nice dress. I am sure I could talk better in 
that white muslin; that is, supposing I could talk 
at all." 

"People do not come together to talk, you goose." 

"What for, then?" 

" And besides, on your plan, what would become 
of the mantua-makers and the shop-keepers ? Peo 
ple must dress a little, to make the world look 
pretty. You will do." 

Caroline proceeded to disrobe me, and I pondered. 
She had touched another thought. How much that 



 

dress had cost. So many dollars; how many I 
could not tell; and I knew other ways, plenty, in 
which the money would give me so much pleasure 
I grudged it. If Caroline and her husband would 
spend so much on me, why could it not be in a 
way that would do me some good ? I would have 
so liked a nice writing desk of some sort. And I 
wanted much a better Bible than the one I had. 
And if the present must be in clothes, how good a 
neat, warm merino would be. I could not say all 
that, but I could not help thinking it. And I was 
not clear about the dress on other grounds. Caro 
line put it back in the box with evident perfect 
satisfaction on her part. I looked on, doubtful. 

" Society ought not to go upon a basis of arti 
ficial flowers," I remarked. 

"You and I are not the architects to set it upon 
a more substantial foundation. Now, Desire, you 
must dance with every one that asks you. Mind 
that." 

" I do not think I shall dance at all." 

" You must." 

"Why?" 

"Everybody does." 

"Why do they?" 

"It is the way. If you do not dance, you are 
left out in the cold." 

"Left out of what?" 

"Out of the world, child." 

Caroline kissed me, smiling, and went off. I sal 
down and tried to get my thoughts together. They 



 

seemed very confused. It was not considered good, 
among us at Chesterfield, that members of the 
church should dance. My sister said, that was 
simple prejudice and ignorance of the world. There 
are such things as prejudice and ignorance of the 
world, I know; and a little retired country place 
is just the legitimate home for them. But was she 
right in the present case ? I could not make up 
my mind. Dancing might be very pleasant, if one 
could be sure it was right; and Caroline said one 
might as well scruple to play croquet. I could 
not make up my mind. 



Sep. 20. 

THE evening came before I had got any light on 
the question which troubled me. It was two 
nights ago. Caroline herself dressed me, and was 
in a great state of contentment when she had done. 
She kissed me, gave me a word of praise, and went 
off to get herself in order. I sat down and tried to 
think, for before I met the company I must be 
resolved what I would do. I looked at myself. 
Lace, gauze, flowers, gloves, slippers, handkerchief; 
all dainty, delicate, graceful, pretty. Yes, and the 
effect of the whole was good, and satisfied me, as 
far as a sense of the beautiful went. But think of 
the money ! In how many ways could the money 
be better spent. I knew the sum total amounted 
to a good deal ; and my thoughts flew to Chester- 

 

field, to Miss Polly Binninger, our nice, good, poor 
neighbour, who I knoiv cannot keep a fire on her 
hearth next winter without help, do what she will ; 
and she does all she can. My dress would keep 
her warm through the whole winter. Then, as 
Caroline would say, there must be society. True, 
I suppose, but can there not be society without all 
this preparation ? My dress is one ; there will be 
fifty more like it, and even far more expensive, 
here to-night; put all that together. Then the 
supper. I knew, for I had heard my sister and 
her husband talking about various items. And 
this is one little party, only one ; and if the cost of 
it were differently applied, it would bring health 
and comfort and rest into half a dozen, what am 
I talking of? into twenty famthe's, where now 
there is and will be pinching want, driving toil, 
anxiety and infirmity. Society ought to be very 
precious, at such a price ! I determined I would 
watch well this evening to see what it really 
amounted to. But would I dance? that must be 
decided first. 

I thought I could make my observations better 
if I kept quite cool ; and perhaps, if I danced, I 
might get caught in the whirl of pleasure, and not 
know what I was doing. Pleasure I believe in, 
certainly; nobody likes it better; but I could not 
be quite sure that I should be doing right in taking this pleasure. Well, at last I fixed upon one 
thing; till I was sure, I would not do it. I would 
wait, and look on and see. 



 

I was ready when Caroline called me, and to 
gether we went down stairs. Sandie surveyed us 
both and gave us a well-pleased smile. 

" Eeady for conquest ? " said he. 

"Why should you say such a thing, Brother 
Sandie?" 

"The thought is so inevitably suggested." 

" But the thing is not true. What has society 
to do with making conquests ? " 

Mr. Birkenstall laughed. " It is the one end and 
purpose of society. To make them, or to hinder 
them, or to secure them. You ladies are all intentionally conquerors; we are the victims." 

"That is what we are supposed to dress for, 
then?" said I. "You know I am an ignoramus, 
and I want to learn. And what do you mean by 
making conquests ? " 

" Surely you know ? " said my brother-in-law with 
a serio-comic face. 

" I do not, indeed." 

" Let her find out, Sandie." 

" No, please answer me," said I. " I am quite in 
earnest." 

"With those blushing cheeks!" said Caroline. 
" Don't believe her." 

"Yes, I am in earnest," I repeated. "I want 
to know what you mean. I am blushing at the 
thought of what you may mean. 

" Quite right," said Sandie nodding. " I mean 
that." 

" You cannot," said I. " You cannot mean that 



 

any girl would try to bring any man to her 
feet?" 

" Any man," said Sandie laconically. "And every 
man. Some girls try for eveiy man." 

He gave me a laughing look, and turned to the 
guests, who began to come in. Whether he was in 
earnest or jest I do not know. But I think it is al 
most worse for a woman to be unwomanly than for 
a man to be unmanly. 

The rooms soon filled with people and with a 
great hum and chatter. I liked it far less than the 
garden party. It was not that I had not enough 
this time to do; for my sister brought plenty of 
people and introduced them to me ; and with every 
one I had a new beginning of conversation to 
make. And it is difficult, just at the beginning of 
a conversation, to get upon any thing interesting. 
People talked the same things over very frequently ; 
they asked me how long I had been in Philadelphia, 
and what I had seen, and remarked that I was seeing Philadelphia under favourable auspices ; which 
I knew, but could hardly discuss. They talked 
about the weather, and compared New York and 
Philadelphia, at least one man did. The scene 
would have been pretty, I think, if I could have 
looked at it with other people's eyes; to mine, I 
confess, it wanted meaning and purpose. Nobody 
said anything I wanted to hear; nobody seemed 
to care about that sort of thing ; it was just a glitter and a hum and a fidget of dressed-up figures ; 
and I thought to myself that without the dressing 



 

it would not have been much. No doubt I am a 
great ignoramus and do not understand things. 
When the dancing began, of course I was asked to 
join in it; but I said I would rather look on for a 
while, and so I got a chance to make my observations. At first I had so many petitions to dance 
that I could do nothing but ward them off; then 
by and by I sapped somewhat aside, in the shadow 
of a window curtain, and then could look and think 
a little. The dancing was a curious spectacle to 
my unaccustomed eyes. All were joining in it, 
not the younger people alone; I saw tolerably 
stout ladies standing gravely up opposite to young 
things like myself, and going through some extraordinary movements with more or less care ; not 
dancing at all, but walking or tripping to measure, 
though indeed they did not always take care of the 
measure ; and in intervals chatting with their partners. Faces wore smiles, universally, yet I could 
not fancy that most of the people were having any 
great jenjoyment. Between the smiles,. I thought 
I could read so much. I questioned myself, what 
had I, Desire Burgoyne, to do with such an entertainment? I, whose home and life in a little 
country village are so different. What sense is 
there in my being attired in gauze and lace, when 
at home I must go back to homespun ? And the 
gauze and lace are prettier, but I would just as 
lieve wear the homespun, for I can do my work in 
it better. And if this is society, I do not think I 
shall lose much. My talk the other night, on the 



 

seat by the water, with Mr. Iredell, that was an 
other matter! I would like a little more of such 
society. But perhaps it would spoil me for the 
place where my life must be ; for there is nothing 
like that in Chesterfield. And I am here in Philadelphia for only a little while, perhaps only for 
this once. It would be very foolish in me to lose 
my heart to this sort of elegant, m^erry, careless 
life, even if I could ; and I like another sort of life 
better. Not that at Chesterfield exactly ; I cannot 
help seeing that that is narrow, and I will make 
mine as wide as I can. 

I was thinking what means I could apply to this 
end, for truly I did not immediately know, when 
the current of my thoughts was changed. A face 
I knew and was glad to see again, came very near 
me ; even Mr. Iredell's own. He came very near, 
without at all seeing me or knowing I was there ; 
for the white lace curtain shrouded my white gauze, 
I standing just in the recess of the window; and 
he came and placed himself leaning against the 
wall just at the other xside of the window, with 
folded arms looking on at the crowd as, without 
folded arms, I had been doing. I was in the shade 
and unseen, and I looked at him now. I had 
had no such good chance before. I knew him 
enough to recognize him, to be sure, and yet his 
face as seen now in perfect repose and gravity 
seemed almost like another face. He stood motionless, very grave, in a careless attitude leaning 
against the corner of the window recess; and I 



 

tried to read him. But it is difficult to read people. Looks and characteristics may be so easily 
misinterpreted. This was like no other face I ever 
saw, and I may say this was like no other fig 
ure. The quiet strength and ease of the outlines 
I thought I could not read wrong; strength both 
physical and moral. He is rather a large man, of 
powerful frame, and well supplied with muscle ; 
and there was all the ease of both sorts of strength 
in his position and air, and the grace of both in the 
somewhat thrown-back head. His face, I thought, 
was the handsomest I had ever seen. The more I 
looked, the more I thought so. It had the same 
characteristics, strength and calm ; while it was at 
the same time the gravest face I ever saw. I do 
not mean sorrowful or gloomy, in the very least; 
only grave. Like the face of one who habitually 
looked through things and saw what they meant ; 
and I would have given something to know his 
thoughts at the moment upon what had occupied 
mine. The features of this face were beautifully 
chiselled, but somewhat massive; the brow strong- 
the hair thick and wavy and pushed back carelessly; the eyes and mouth, as I said, grave, but 
very calm, and indicating a world of power and 
character. I looked and looked, and Mr. Iredell 
never moved. It came over me to wonder that 
this man should have taken the trouble to talk to 
me as he did the other night. , Yes, he was not a 
young man, not very young, that is ; he had seen 
something of life and taken his part in it, that was 



 

plain. I wished he would find me out, but I hardly 
dared breathe for fear I should help him to the discovery. And I do not know what ever made him 
at last look my way, for I am certain I had not 
stirred to make the least noise; yet suddenly he 
turned and met my eyes full. I felt ashamed, and 
he started from his position. 

" In hiding ! " he exclaimed. 

" Something like it," I answered. 

" May one ask, what you are hiding from ? " he 
said laughing. 

"It is a fair question, Mr. Iredell. I suppose I 
ought to answer, if I can. You know, I am a 
country girl. All this is a new scene to me. I 
was willing, if I could, to get a one side a little 
and look at it quietly, and make up my mind about 
it. And besides, I wanted to get out of the way of 
invitations to dance." 

" You do not dance ? How happens that ? " 

" I have not made up my mind about it." 

" Whether you will or not ? " 

"Whether I ought." 

"That is a doubt very few people share." 

"My friends here say the doubt is narrow, and 
arises from prejudice only; because I have been 
brought up so." 

"And you wanted to make up your own judg 
ment ? How is it you are not taking the general 
method, which is, to do a thing first, and consider 
it afterwards; that is, supposing the time for consideration ever comes." 



 

" Is that the general method ? " 

" How comes it not to be yours ? " 

" I do not know. I suppose, because, I can 
not take pleasure in a thing if I am in doubt 
about it." 

" Is the ground of your doubt in the present 
case simply education ? as you say, being brought 
up so ? 

I hesitated, for he was not dancing himself; I 
presumed that he shared my doubt, and why 
should he care to know the ground of it. I hesitated, but everyone knows there are a few people 
in the world to whom the impulse to talk out is 
very irresistible. Since Mr. Iredell paid me the 
compliment of asking the question, why should 
not I pay him the compliment of answering it ? 

" I think my doubt lies here," said I. " You will 
not laugh at me, and perhaps you can help me. 
I cannot get over these words Whatsoever ye 
do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. I can 
not see how I can do this in his name. " 

" By in his name/ you mean ?" 

" I hardly know how to put it. * In his name 
must meanjfor him somehow; as his servant, I suppose ; doing his work." 

Mr. Iredell looked at me, a look I did not comprehend; somewhat considering and fixed, but not 
at all unpleasant. 

" And whatsoever you do, you wish to do it as 
his servant, doing his work?" said he. 
"Yes, certainly." 



 

"So do I." 

" Then do you think I am mistaken ? or can you 
make me wiser in the matter? You do not dance 
yourself? " 

He did not answer immediately. At the moment there came a whirl of waltzers by, and we 
both looked on. Pair after pair, white, blue, and 
golden coloured draperies flew and flashed before 
us, each embraced by a black coat sleeve ; air and 
attitude and manner varied in different cases, but 
while some were graceful and some ungraceful, I 
confess all were bewildering to me. 

" I can not see what is the pleasure of that," I 
ventured. 

" You are mistaken," said Mr. Iredell ; " it has its 
pleasure, far more than the languid quadrille. )
speak from experience. The matching of move 
ment and measure, the excitement of music and 
motion together, are exceedingly intoxicating." 

" It looks senseless," said I. " People turned 
into animated tops!" 

" That is an unsophisticated view of it," said 
my companion smiling. " Don't tell anybody else. 
Come down to the refreshment room and let me 
get you something, and I will tell you what I have 
seen." 

That was a promise which would have drawn me 
much further. He gave me his arm, and we went 
through the crowd, winding our way out among 
the moving and swaying, floating and surging 
people, and got down stairs to the dining-room. 



 

Here the table was set, and people came and went 
as they pleased; just now the room was almost 
empty. My companion gave me a seat and put a 
plate of salad in my hand, which I took just that 
I might have something to do while I listened. 
But he seemed to have forgotten his promise, until 
I reminded him. * 

" A man can easily make himself a bore by tell 
ing all the things he has seen," he remarked. 

" Not to me," said I, " for I have seen nothing. 
It is all new." 

" I think you told me this is your first visit to 
Philadelphia." 

"Yes; or to any city. I have sometimes gone 
into Boston, when I was at school near there ; but 
only for a few hours." 

" I am interested to know how it strikes you." 

" It strikes me with the sense of what a little 
corner of the world I have lived in, and always 
shall live in, most likely. After what you were 
telling me the other night at the garden party, I 
began to feel what a large place the world is." 

" It is a large place," said he. 

"It must be very pleasant to know it, as you 
do." 

"And it seems to me very pleasant, not to know 
it, as you do." 

"Because I may have the pleasure of learii. 
ing?" 

" It is better not to know some things," he said, 
looking at me kindly. 



 

" I hope what you were going to tell me is not 
one of them ? " 

"No," said he smiling; "and yet it is a story 
about dancing. You remarked up stairs that the 
waltz looked to you senseless. I believe most things 
have significance, one way or another, and even a 
waltz is no exception. "I was going to tell you how 
much meaning dancing may have and express. I 
saw this a long while ago, in Europe " 

"How'd ye do, Mr. Iredell," said a soft voice near 
at hand. I looked up, in disagreeable surprise that 
anybody should venture to interrupt a conversation 
so wantonly ; but I found it seemed to be quite in 
order. The fair speaker had no conscience of rudeness, or if she had she did not shew it. Mr. Ire- 
dell bowed. He had remained standing, when I 
eat down. Now I expected that he would introduce me; but he did not. The disturber of my 
pleasure was a fair creature, a young girl, looking perhaps younger than she was. Her hair, of 
shining black, was dressed in thick curls falling 
down upon neck and shoulders. Neck and shoul 
ders were very white. Her dress, heavy and rich, 
was black, only relieved by lace ; and her eyes were 
as bright and as black as two berries, or as two 
black diamonds. She stood and looked at Mr. Iredell, I thought, as if she liked him. I could not 
help the impression. 

" I thought you never went to parties ? " she be 
gan, challenging him. 

" Yet you see, here I am." 



 

" But you do not dance ? " 

" I do not dance." 

"Then what are you here for? that is what I
want to know." 

" It seems to you there is nothing to be done 
but dancing." 

"You are not eating, or drinking; and I do not 
suppose you care for it. Get me a cup of coffee, 
please." 

While Mr. Iredell was doing this, the stranger 
surveyed me; not staringly, not rudely, but with 
one sweeping comprehensive glance of her bright 
eyes which took in, I thought, all there was of me. 
Accepting the coffee, she continued. 

" I thought you never went in for nonsense, even 
sweet nonsense ? " 

" I don't know the article." 

"0 that's a white lie! What else do you get 
here ? " 

" Not that, I assure you." 

"You don't expect sense; nobody talks sense at a 
dance ; they can't you know ; how can they, hopping 
round ? And you don't like anything but sense ; so 
I don't see what you came for. What did you ? " 

" Is your coffee right ? " 

"Better than your politeness. Why don't you 
answer me ? " 

" I suppose, because you are not a judge." 

" A judge of what ? " 

"Of me." 

" I am, though. I can't help judging people, and 



 

you can't. I came here for something, and you 
came here for something ; and if it wasn't pleasure, 
I am curious to know what it was." 

" I never said it was not pleasure." 

" No, but there is only one sort of pleasure to be 
had here, and that is a sort you don't like. What 
were you talking about? This is Mrs. Birkenst all's 
sister, I know. Introduce me, please." 

" Miss Burgoyne, this lady is Miss Forella." 

" I am very glad to meet you," said the young 
lady easily. " Mrs. Birkenstall promised to introduce me, but I had no opportunity to claim her 
promise. Is this horrid man keeping you from 
dancing ? " 

"No," said I, extremely astonished. 

"You must not mind anything he says. He 
don't dance himself, so, you see, he cries sour 
grapes. Dear me, if I minded Mr. Iredell ! there 
would be nothing left in life. Not a thing. All 
the  sweet nonsense which he doesn't believe in, 
you see, I live upon. I am a kind of a butterfly, 
and butterflies live on honey, don't they? if they 
don t, I don't know what they do live on. But 
what's life good for? Now I op! don't begin to 
tell me what it is good for, because we don't 
agree. I believe people are meant to be happy, 
and enjoy themselves. 

" Honestly, do you manage to accomplish that ? " 
Mr. Iredell. " Now I do." 

" I enjoy myself ever so much," said the girl with 

look at him. " Don't you think I do ? " 



 

No." 

"Why not?" 

" When people are happy, they usually look so." 

" And I don't look happy ? What do you think 
of Miss Burgoyne ? does she ? 

" Judge for yourself." 

Miss Forella surveyed me again, with a little 
more consideration; and something in the look 
was not comfortable, was not pleasant to me. I 
did not know then and I do not know now, what 
it was. " 

" Has he been telling you dancing is nonsense?" 
she asked. 

"On the contrary," said Mr. Iredell. "I was 
just about to tell Miss Burgoyne how much mean 
ing there may be in dancing." 

" Meaning in dancing ? There is never any 
meaning in my dancing; only fun." 

" I did not intend to describe your dancing." , 

"Whose, then?" 

Mr. Iredell named a name which I did not under 
stand. Miss Forella did not know it either. He 
explained that it had belonged to a very famous 
public dancer in Er vpe, some years ago. 

" And you saw her ! " cried Miss Forella, while 
the black eyes twinkled. 

" I saiv her. I would not venture to describe 
such a scene upon hearsay." 

" And are you going to describe to us her danc- 
ing?" 

"If you will listen to me." 



 

" I'll be delighted. But the idea ! The grave Mr. 
Iredell, who does not believe in sweet nonsense, 
describing to the gay Miss Forella, who swallows 
all she can get, a specially sweet bit of special 
nonsense! It's delightful. I'm ready. Go on." 

" You do not know what I am going to give 
you." 

" It's about a ballet dancer and her dancing." 

"I told you, it was dancing with a meaning 
to it." 

"I never heard of such a thing before. But 
go on." 

" First, please," said I "What is a ballet dancer ? 

" Why, did you never see a ballet ? " 

" No," said Mr. Iredell. " She does not know 
what you mean. She never went to the theatre." 

" Poor creature ! Well you cannot tell her." 

"I will try. Miss Burgoyne, a ballet is a dra
