He passed the Baptist church, where the vestry 
was lighted for a prayer-meeting, and a trustful 
choir were pathetically rehearsing Hold the Fort, 



 

with what they were pleased to call a cabinet or 
gan and a soprano who cultivated a cold upon the 
lungs. The frost was as thick as plush npon the 
windows of the vestry. 

It was too early for either of these sources of 
social diversion to be open to the public. Yorko 
met no one, and walked as slowly as he could 
without congealing, stumbling through the dark, 
over the drifted road, till he came in sight of Mr. 
Batter well 's familiar square house. He came first 
upon the doctor 's wing. Lights were in the office, 
and in her parlor. The reception-room was dark. 
Encouraged by this to think that the office hour 
was either over it used to be over by seven 
o clock or else that no one was there, he pushed 
on, and softly made his way up the walk and to 
the piazza, where he paused. It was now snowing 
fast, and he stood in the whirl and wet, over 
whelmed by a hesitation that he dared neither 
disregard nor obey. His thoughts at that moment, 
with a whimsical irrelevance, reverted to the let 
ter he wrote when he first got back to Nahant, in 
which he had asked for her bill. She sent it, after 
a scarcely perceptible delay. He thought it rather 
small, but dared not say so. She had not written 
since. Now, after a few moments reflection, he 
softly turned the handle of the door, without
ringing. There was no furnace in the house, and the 
entry was cold. The door of the reception-room 
was shut. He opened this, also, without knock 
ing, and, closing it quietly behind him, stood for 
a minute with his back to the door. She was not 
there, or she did not hear him. There was a soap- 
stone stove in the reception-room, in which a huge 
fire burned sturdily. Plants were blossoming some 
where, and he perceived that there must be carna 
tions among them. The office door and the door 
into the parlor were both open ; a delicious, even 
warmth, summer-like and scented, pervaded all the 
rooms. He stepped on into the office, and stood 
still. The snow was sprinkled on his fur collar 
and black hair and beard. 

" Handy ? " she called from the parlor, in that 
rapid way he had noticed when he first knew her, 
and which he had come to associate with her anx 
ious or wearied moods. " Handy, is that you ? 
Come here." 

Yorke made no answer, but advanced a step or 
two, and so met her for, startled by silence, she 
had risen immediately on the threshold of the 
inner room. 

His heart leaped to see that she lost her color. 
She did, indeed. A flash, like fear, vibrated across 
her figure and upraised face, then fell, and she had 



 

herself instantly. She held up both hands to him 
and drew him graciously into the bright warmth 
fo the room, led him to the lamp before she spoke, 
took off the yellow globe, and let the white 
radiance full on his face. 

" You are well ! " she said, exultantly. " You 
are a well man ! " 

" As well as I ever was in my life, Doctor Zay. 
And stronger, by far. Do you see ? " 

He squared his fine shoulders, and smiled. 

" Yes, I see." 

Her firm eyes lifted, looked at him piercingly, 
then wandered, wavered. A beautiful mistiness 
overswept them; her will, like a drowning thing, 
seemed to struggle with it ; she regarded him 
through it fixedly ; then her dark lashes dropped. 
She turned away, not without embarrassment, and 
motioned him to a chair. 

He forgot to take it, but stood looking at her 
dizzily. She wore something brown, a dress of 
heavy cloth, and it was trimmed with leopard fur, 
like that he saw in the sleigh. She did not 
recover her composure. She was like a beautiful 
wild creature. Her splendid color and fire mocked 
him. Who was he that he should think to tame 
her ? Yet, should a man let go his hold on a 
moment like this ? By the beating of his own 



 

beai t, he knew that life itself might never yield 
him such another. He flung his whole soul into 
one swift venture. 

" Dear," he said, " I am too strong, now, to be 
denied. I have come back for you." 

" Oh, hush ! " she cried. She had a tone of 
fathomless entreaty. She turned from him pas 
sionately, and began to pace the room. 

He saw how she tried to regain her poise, and 
he saw with exultance how she failed. 

"No, no," he said, with a low laugh. "That 
is not what I have traveled three hundred miles 
for. Oh, how glad I am I surprised you, that 
I took you off your guard ! Don't mind it ! Why 
should you care ? Why should you battle so ? 
Why should you fight me? Tell me why." 

He followed her with an imperious step. She 
came to a halt, midway in the bright room. She 
lowered her head and craned her neck, looking 
from him to the door, as if she would take flight, 
like a caged thing. He stretched his hand before 
her. 

" Why do you fear me so ? " 

" I fear you because you love me." 

" No, that is not it," he said, firmly. " You 
fear me because you love me" 

He thought, for the moment, that he had lost 



 

her forever by this bold detour. She seemed to 
double and wheel, and elude him. She drew her 
self up in her old way. 

"It is impossible ! " she said, haughtily. 

" It is natural," he said, gently. 

" You do not understand how to talk to a 
woman ! " blazed Doctor Zay. " It is 
presumptuous. It is unpardonable. You torture her. You 
;.re rough. You have no right " 

He advanced a step nearer to her. 

" How beautiful you are ! " he said, deliriously. 

She turned from him, and walked to the other 
end of the room. He looked across the warm, 
bright width. A high fire was flashing in the 
open hearth. She stopped, and held out her 
hands before it ; he could see that they shook. 
She stood with her back to him. He could hear 
the storm beating on the windows, as if it were 
mad to enter this sacred, sheltered place, where 
fate had thrown them together, they two out 
of the wintry world, for that one hour, alone. 

He advanced towards her, with resolute rever 
ence, and spoke her name. She looked over her 
shoulder. He felt that she defied him, soul and 
body. 

" I have assumed a great deal, I know," lie 
said, in a tone from which the last cadence of self- 



 

assertion had died ; " it is in your power to
correct my folly and deny my affirmation." 

She turned her face towards the fire again, 
before which her averted figure stood out like a 
splendid silhouette. This silent gesture was her 
only answer. 

" I am not so conceited a fellow as to insist that 
a woman loves me, against her denial," proceeded 
Yorke, with a manly timidity that well became 
him ; " and I have been rough, I know, coming 
upon you so suddenly, and taking advantage of 
your natural emotion. I do not wish to be ungen 
erous ; no, nor unfair. I will not urge you any 
more to-night, if you would rather not. Shall I 
go away ? " 

" Yes, please," she said in a whisper. 

He turned to obey her, but, half across the room, 
looked hungrily back. 

Then he saw that she had clasped her hands 
upon the mantel-piece, and that her strong face 
had sunk till it was buried in them. She started 
as he turned, as if his gaze had been a blow, and 
shrank before him, a shaken creature. 

Even at that moment, he felt more a sense of 
awe than of transport, at the sight of her royal 
overthrow. He was beside her in a moment, and 
gently putting his own hand upon her cold, clenched 
fingers said, 



 

" Dear, is it true ? " 

" Oh, I am afraid it is true." 

" And why should you be afraid of the truth ? " 

" Oh, it is a fearful thing for a woman to 
love a man "... 

"It doesn't  frighten me." He held out his 
arms, with his low, glad laugh. " Come, and see 
how dreadful it is ! Come ! " 

But she shook her head, and both her firm hands 
warned him off. 

" I have lost my self-possession," she pleaded. 
" I have lost myself. Let me alone. I cannot 
talk to you to-night. Go, and don't I cannot 
bear to have you expect anything. I entreat you 
not to hope for anything. It will be so hard to 
make you understand "... 

" It will, indeed," cried the lover joyously, " be 
hard to make me understand anything but Eden, 
now ! " 

But he spared her for that time, and, drunken 
with hope, went out, the maddest, gladdest, most 
ignorant man that faced the storm that night. 

He waded across the piazza, where the snow 
was now drifting high. The dead stalk of a hon 
eysuckle clutched at him feebly, as he went by. 
He presented himself at Mrs. Butterwell 's door, 
and bore dreamily the little domestic whirl which 



 

followed. The only coherent thought he had was 
a passionate desire to be alone. Mrs. Butterwell 
hastened to call the doctor, but he said he had 
spoken to her as he came along. Mr. Butterwell 
began at once to give him the particulars relative 
to the last hours of the sorrel. Mrs. Butterwell 
bustled about blankets, and fires, and things. She 
looked a great way off, to Yorke, and small ; he 
heard her imperfectly, and had to ask her to repeat what she said. He seemed to be floating, a 
being of another race, from another planet, high 
above the heads of these old married people ; in a 
blinding light, at a perilous height, from which 
he regarded them with a beautiful scorn. 

He hastened to his room, under plea of fatigue, at 
the first pardonable moment. It was warm there, 
and still. The bed had been moved into a new 
place, and the framed certificate was gone. The 
hair- cloth sofa was there, and the little three-legged 
table where the medicine used to stand. There was 
a great fire in a fat, air-tight stove. He wheeled 
up the black sofa, and sat down, and watched 
the red oblong blocks of light made by the open 
damper in the side of the stove. He sat there a 
long time. Sleep seemed as impossible as pain, 
and connected thought as foreign as fear. He 
drifted in his delirium. He had no future, he 



 

knew no past. She loved him. He reeled before 
the knowledge of it. Possession seemed profanity. 

Where was her peer in all the world ? And she 

chose him ! With closed eves he repeated the 

three words, She loves me, as he might have dashed 
down a dangerous wine, of which he had already 
more than man could bear. He was intoxicated 
with her. 

He got through the next day as best he might. 
His host and hostess brought a first mortgage upon 
him, and Doctor Zay was hard at work. She was 
early at breakfast, late at dinner, and apparently 
took no tea. He saw her once struggling through 
the snow to give an order to Handy, who seemed 
to have added a number at his hatter 's for each 
degree of severity in the thermometer. Handy 
had private views, which no man could fathom, 
relative to Mr. Yorke 's unexpected appearance ; 
but they were not of a nature which improved his 
temper, and, under the present climatic conditions 
lie was denied the resources of the sawdust heap. 
Handy wore blue mittens and a red tippet tied 
over his ears. He drove with the doctor that day, 
to watch the pony, who was uneasy from the cold, 
in her extended " waits." Doctor Zay was 
wrapped in her furs, and had long, seal-skin 



 

gloves. She looked a trifle pale. Yovke watched 
the brave girl ride away into the deadly weather. 
She drove slowly, battling with the unbroken road. 
She carried a shovel to cut their way through 
drifts. 

In the evening, as soon as might decently be, 
he went to her rooms. She was alone, and wel 
comed him with unexpected self-possession. She 
had a feverish flush on her cheeks. She began 
to talk as if nothing had happened. She inquired 
about his health, and the medical items of his recovery. She spoke of his mother, and his life in 
Boston. 

Indulgently, he let her go on. He experienced 
an exquisite delight in all this little parrying and 
playing with fate, and in the haughty conscious 
ness that he could put an end to it when he chose. 
He occupied himself in noticing that she wore a 
woolen dress of a ruby color, with a plush jacket 
and white lace. 

"I have been at woxk myself, this winter," he 
ventured to say. " Did I tell you ? " 
" No. What have you done ? " 
" Sat in my office and prayed for clients." 
"I approve of that. Didn't  you get any ? " 
" Oh yes ; some wills and leases, and that kind 
of thing. Greatness is not thrust upon me. But 
I 've sat there." 


" Go on sitting there," said Doctor Zay, with a 
little nod. 

" Thank you. I propose to." 

She colored, and was silent. 

" I wish you could have heard the Christmas 
oratorio," began Yorke again; "and Salvini, and 
the Damnation of Faust, it was given twice. 
I used to think there was nobody in Boston who 
enjoyed Salvini as you would. Then we 've had 
unusually good opera. I must tell you about the 
pictures some time ; there have been one or two 
really excellent exhibitions." 

" Tell me now," said she hungrily, leaning her 
head back in her chair and closing her eyes. 

" No, not now. I have other things to say. 
You must come and see and hear for yourself." 

" I don't know but I shall," she said simply. 

" Confess you are starving in this snowdrift ! " 

" A little hungry, sometimes ; it is worse in the 
winter. It would rest me to hear one fine or 
chestral concert. Do you remember what Irma 
said ? " 

" Irma who ? " 

" Why, in On the Heights. I want nothing 
of the world without, but some good music, with 
a full orchestra. " 

" You shall hear a hundred," murmured he. 



 

" It is fatuity to imprison yourself here, it is 
cruel. I can't bear it. It must come to an end 
as soon as possible. It has infuriated me all win 
ter to think of you. I had to drive you out of my 
mind, like the evil one. You must come down 
from your heights to the earth, like other peeple." 

" Perhaps," said Doctor Zay, " when some of my 
poor women here are better. I have a few cases 
it would be disloyal to leave now. But perhaps, 
before I am old, I may move. I have thought 
that I should like to settle in Boston, if I were 
sure of a footing. I know the women there, in 
our school. Some of them are excellent ; one of 
them is eminent. But there are none now (there 
was one, but she died) working on precisely my 
basis. Indeed, there are very few men who stand 
just where I do, and they would not help me any. 
I should be rather alone." 

It was impossible to mistake the fine uncon 
sciousness of these words. Yorke looked at her 
with amazement, which deepened into a vague 
distress. 

" We are not thinking of the same things at 
all ! " he said suddenly. 

" What could you think I was thinking of ? " 
she cried hotly. 

" And what could you think I was thinking of ? 



 

What does a man think of when he loves a 
woman ? " 

" Oh, you 've come back to that again," said 
Doctor Za} r , with an unnatural because feeble ef 
fort at lightness. But she pushed back her chair, 
and her manner instantaneously underwent a 
change. Yorke watched her for some moments 
in guarded silence. 

" I have returned," he said at length, " to where 
we left off, last night. Why do you wish to make 
it hard for me ? " 

" I was insane," she said, " to let you get to 
that point. I ought to have prevented a woman 
should control such things. I do not know what 
I was thinking of." 

" You were thinking that you loved me," he 
said gravely. 

She was silent. 

" Do you want to take that back ? " 

" I wish I had never said it." 

" Do you wish to take it back? " 

" Alas," she said, below her quickening breath, 
" I cannot ! It is too late." 

" You admit as much as that ? It was not a 
mood, nor a but you are not capable of caprice. 
Then you have admitted everything," he said ec 
statically, " and all the rest is clear." 



 

She smiled drearily. " Nothing is clear, Mr. 
Yorke, except that we must separate. We have 
both of us lived long enough to know that a man 
and woman who love each other and cannot marry, 
have no choice but to turn short round, and follow 
different roads. You and I are such a man and 
woman. Let us bring our good sense to the thing, 
at the outset." 

" I am desitute of power to see why we should 
not marry," said Yorke, with a sudden faint sink 
ing at the heart. She was without the tinseled 
tissue of coquetry. He knew that he had to deal 
not with a disguise, but a conviction. She had not 
that indigence of nature which could have offered 
irreverence either to his feeling or her own. " I 
told you long ago," he went on, "that you should 
not be expected to surrender your profession. I 
should be ashamed of myself if I could ask it of 
you. I am proud of you. I feel my heart leap 
over everything you achieve. It is as if I had 
done it myself, only that it makes me happier, it 
makes me prouder. I want you just as you are, 
the bravest woman I ever knew, the strongest 
woman and the sweetest. Do you think I would 
take your sweetness without your strength ? I 
want it all. I want you. There is nothing I will 
not do to make you feel this, to make it easy, to 



 

help you along. I could help you a very little in 
Boston. That has been a comfort to me. Why, 
what kind of a fellow should I be, if I could ap 
proach a woman like you, and propose to drink 
down her power and preciousness into my one lit 
tle thirsty life, absorb her, annihilate her, 
and offer her nothing but myself in exchange for 
a freedom so fine, an influence so important, as 
yours ? I shall never be a great man, but I am 
not small enough for that ! " 

She had listened to him attentively, and now 
lifted her eyes, which seemed again to retreat from 
him with that sacred timidity. 

" I never heard a man talk like that before," 
she said softly. " It is something even to say it. 
I thank you, Mr. Yorke. Your manliness and no 
bleness only make it harder for me " Her 
voice sank. 

" Everything should be done to make the sacri 
fice as light as it can be made," urged Yorke. " I 
have thought it all over and all through. I know 
what I am saying. This is not the rhapsody of a 
lover who cannot see beyond his momentary ec 
stasy. I offer you the devotion of a man who has 
belief in the great objects of your life ; in whom 
you have created that belief ; to whom you have 
become Oh, you are so dear to me ! " he added 



 

brokenly, " I cannot think of life without you. I 
never knew what love was like before. I never 
understood that a woman could be to any man 
what you are, must be, to me." 

While he .spoke she had grown very pale, and it 
was with difficult composure that she said, 

" Listen to me, Mr. Yorke ! This is only 
hurting us both, you and me too, to no whole 
some end. Hear what I have to say, and then we 
must stop. I appreciate oh, believe me! 
your generosity, and the loyalty you have to your 
own feeling for me. I never expected to find it. 
I did not suppose you were capable of it. I grant 
you that. I have never thought but that you 
would desire the woman you loved to be like other 
women, to give up everything. I have trained 
myself to think so, all along. You have taken me 
by surprise, I admit. You are more of a man than 
I thought you were " 

" It is your own work, if I am," he interrupted, 
smiling hopefully. 

" But you do not know," she proceeded hastity, 
" what it is that you are saying. I do. You and 
I are dreaming a dream. It has a waking, and 
that is marriage. Few young men and women 
know anything more of the process of adjusting 
love to marriage than they do of the architecture 



 

of Kubla Khan 's palace. I have had, as you will 
see, exceptional opportunities to study the subject. 
I have profited by them. Mr. Yorke, I never knew 
but three marriages in my life that were real ! " 

" So you told me once before," he said. " I 
never forgot it. Ours would be the fourth." 

She shook her head with a melancholy smile. 
" You do not understand. You have not had my 
chances to see how it is. I do not think lightly 
of these things. Next to the love between man 
and his Creator (if there is such a thing, and I 
believe we must admit that there is), the love of 
one man and one woman is the loftiest and the 
most illusive ideal that has been set before the 
world. , A perfect marriage is like a pure heart : 
those who have it are fit to see God. Any other 
is profanity to me ; it is a desecration to think of. 
I should be tortured. It would kill me to miss it. 
It is a matter in which I cannot risk anything, or 
I must reduce the risk to a minimum. Oh, women 
of my sort are thought not to reverence marriage, 
to undervalue it, to substitute our little personal 
ambitions for all that blessedness ! I never spoke 
of these things before. I am not ashamed to tell 
you. Oh, it is we who know the worth of it ! 
we who look on out of our solitary lives, perhaps 
through our instructed experience and trained 

 

emotion. We will not I will not have any hap 
piness that is not the most perfect this world can 
give me. I will not stoop to anything I can fathom 
and measure. Love should be like a mighty sea. 
It should overflow everything. Nothing should be 
able to stand before it. Love is a miracle. All 
laws yield to it. I should scorn to take anything 
that I feared for, or guarded, to look on and 
say, At such a time, such a consequence will follow 
such a cause. Then he will feel so and so. And 
then I shall suffer this and that, and to know, 
by all the knowledge my life 's work has brought 
me, that it would all come as I foresaw, that we 
should ever look at one another like the married 
people I have known. Oh, I have watched that 
bitterness too often ! I know all the steps, I 
have had their confidences. You don't know what 
things people tell their doctors. I have heard too 
much. Years ago, I said, I will never suffer that 
descent." 

" Do you mean," asked Yorke trying to speak 
with a courage which he did not feel, " that you 
took a vow never to marry at all ? " 

" Oh no," she said, with her ready candor. 
" I am not one of those women. It is not honest 
to assume that there is any perfect life without 
happiness. It is idle to pretend that happiness 



 

and loneliness are not contradictory terms. I have 
always known that I should marry if the miracle 
happened. I never expected it to happen. I put 
it out of my mind. I have known I should be a 
solitary woman. I am prepared for it. I would 
rather live twenty lonely lives than to suffer that 
desecration, to see you look some morning as if 
it wearied you. I have seen them ! I know the 
look. It would murder me." 

" The miracle has happened ! " He approached 
her with a passionate movement. " Trust it." 

She shook her head. 

" We love each other," he urged, " we love 
each other ! " 

" We think so," she said sadly. " You think 
so. But you do not know what it all means. If 
I had been like the other women Oh, I am 
sorry you have wasted all this feeling on me. If 
it had been some lovely girl, who had nothing to 
do but to adore you, who could give you every 
thing " 

" I should have tired of her in six weeks," 
said Yorke. 

" And I will give you sixteen to tire of me ! " 
she said quickly. But when she saw how this 
wounded him she was sorry she had said it, and 
hastened to add more calmly, " You see, Mr. 



 

Yorke, you have been so unfortunate as to become 
interested in a new kind of woman. The trouble 
is that a happy marriage with such a woman de 
mands a new type of man. By and by you would 
chafe under this transitional position. You would 
come home, some evening, when I should not be 
there (but I should feel worse not to be there than 
you would to miss me). You would need me 
when I was called somewhere urgently. You 
would reflect, and react, and waver, and then it 
would seem to you that you were neglected, that 
you were wronged. You would think of the other 
men, whose wives were always punctual at dinner 
in long dresses, and could play to them evenings, 
and accept invitations, and always be on hand, 
like the kitten. I should not blame you. Some 
of the loveliest women in the world are like that. 
I should like somebody myself to come home to, 
to be always there to purr about me ; it is very 
natural to me to accept the devotion of such 
women. There was one who wanted to come down 
here and stay with me. I wouldn't  let her ; but I 
wanted her. With you it is more : it is an inher 
ited instinct. Generations of your fathers have 
bred it in you. You would not know how to .cul 
tivate happiness with a woman who had diverged 
from her hereditary type. Happiness must be 



 

cultivated. It is like character. It is not a thing 
to be safely let alone for a moment, or it will run 
to weeds. It would slip out of our hands like 
thistle-down, and I should be made to feel you 
would feel, and your mother and all the people 
you had been taught to care for that I was to 
blame ; that it was a life-long mistake for you to 
have married a woman with a career, who had any 
thing else to do but be your wife " 

" My mother, of all women I know, would be 
the first to uphold you," interrupted Yorke. 
" She believes in all that sort of thing about 
women. I never thought of it till this minute. 
It used to mortify me when I was a boy ; then it 
only bored me. I shall kiss her for it when I get 
home ! You need not give a second thought to 
my mother. She has never got over what you 
did for me last summer, and she 's dying to see 
you, in any capacity. If you came to her in that 
of a daughter, she would set you on a pinnacle, 
and fall down and worship you." 

" It has been very manly in you," said Doctor 
Zay musingly, " never once to ask me to give up 
my work. I shall not forget it." 

" I never thought of asking it," said Yorke. 
" It 's not because I have any particular theories, 
and I should be ashamed to let you credit me with 



 

any sort of nobility about it. I don't want it any 
other way. It would undo everything. It would 
make another woman of you. I want you just as 
you are. Come ! " he said, with a different tone. 
He leaned above her. She had never seen such 
wells of tenderness in any man 's eyes. She tried 
to look into them, but her own fell. 

" You make it so hard for me ! " she cried, in a 
quick, anguished tone. 

Then Yorke drew back. " You do not trust 
me," he said hoarsely. " You do not believe that 
I love you." 

She stretched out her hands to him in a mute 
appeal. 

" I have waited on your caution and protest 
long enough," he went on excitedly. " I went 
home last summer, as you bade me. I let you 
think I thought you might be right. I let you 
treat my love like a fit of the measles. You sup 
posed I was going away to convalesce like a boy, 
and establish your theory. I never believed it for 
one moment ! I knew all the time that what you 
call the miracle had got me. It has got you, too, 
thank Heaven ! You can't escape it. You can't 
help it. Try, if you want to. I 'll leave you to 
wprk it out. A man can stand a good deal, but 
there comes a point beyond which lie must retreat 
in self-defense. I have reached that point."
