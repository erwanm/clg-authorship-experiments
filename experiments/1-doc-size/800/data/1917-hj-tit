their extraordinary little subject in charge — 
with every care indeed not to alarm him; to the 
point that, on his absolute refusal to let her go 
home with him and his arresting a hack, on the 
public road, which happened to come into view 
empty, the two had entered the vehicle and she 
had not lost sight of him till, his earnest call upon 
his daughter at Mrs. Bradham's achieved, he 





 

had been in effect restored to his own house. 
His daughter, who lived with her eyes on his 
liability to lapses, was now watching with him, 
and was well aware, Miss Mumby averred, of 
what the crisis might mean; as to whose own 
due presence of mind in the connection indeed 
how could there be better proof than this present 
lucidity of her appeal to Mr. Betterman's guest 
on such a matter as her prompt thought for spar- 
ing him delay ? 

"If she didn't want you to wait to dress, it 
can only be, I guess, to make sure of seeing you 
before anything happens," his guide was at no 
loss to remark; "and if she can mention dinner 
while the old gentleman is — well, as he is — it 
shows she's not too beside herself to feel that 
you'll at any rate want yours." 

"Oh for mercy's sake don't talk of dinner!" 
Gray pulled up under the influence of these reve- 
lations quite impatiently to request. "That's not 
what I'm most thinking of, I beg you to believe, 
in the midst of such prodigies and portents." 
They had crossed the small stretch of road which 
separated Mr. Betterman's gate from that of the 
residence they were addressed to; and now, 
within the grounds of this latter, which loomed 
there, -through vague boskages, with an effect of 
windows numerously and precipitately lighted, 
the forces of our young friend's consciousness 
were all in vibration at once. "My wondrous 





 

uncle, I don't mind telling you, since you're so 
kind to me, has given me more extraordinary 
things to think of than I see myself prepared in 
any way to do justice to; and if I'm further to 
understand you that we have' between us, you 
and I, destroyed this valuable life, I leave you to 
judge whether what we may have to face in con- 
sequence finds me eager." 

"How do you know it's such a valuable life?" 
Miss Mumby surprisingly rejoined; sinking that 
question, however, in a livelier interest, before 
his surprise could express itself. "If she has 
sent me for you it's because she knows what 
she's about, and because I also know what I am 
— so that, wanting you myself so much to come, 
I guess I'd have gone over for you on my own 
responsibility. Why, Mr. Fielder, your place is 
right here by her at such a time as this, and if 
you don't already realise it I'm very glad I've 
helped you." 

Such was the consecration under which, but 
a few minutes later, Gray found himself turning 
about in the lamp-lit saloon of the Gaws very 
much as he had a few hours before revolved at 
the other house. Miss Mumby had introduced 
him into this apartment straight from the terrace 
to which, in the warm air, a long window or two 
stood open, and then had left him with the as- 
surance that matters upstairs would now be in 
shape for their friend to join him at once. It 





 

was perhaps because he had rather inevitably 
expected matters upstairs — and this in spite of 
his late companion's warning word — to assault 
him in some fulness with Miss Gaw's appearance 
at the door, that a certain failure of any such 
effect when she did appear had for him a force, 
even if it was hardly yet to be called a sense, 
beyond any air of her advancing on the tide of 
pain. He fairly took in, face to face with her, 
that what she first called for was no rattle of 
sound, however considerately pitched, about the 
question of her own fear; she had pulled no long 
face, she cared for no dismal deference: she but 
stood there, after she had closed the door with 
a backward push that took no account, in the 
hushed house, of some possible resonance, she 
but stood there smiling in her mild extravagance 
of majesty, smiling and smiling as he had seen 
women do as a preface to bursting into tears. 
He was to remember afterwards how he had felt 
for an instant that whatever he said or did would 
deprive her of resistance to an inward pressure 
which was growing as by the sight of him, but 
that she would thus break down much more 
under the crowned than under the menaced 
moment — thanks to which appearance what 
could be stranger than his inviting her to clap 
her hands ? Still again was he later to recall 
that these hands had been the moment after 
held in his own while he knew himself smiling 





 

too and saying: "Well, well, well, what wonders 
and what splendours!" and seeing that though 
there was even more of her in presence than he 
had reckoned there was somehow less of her in 
time; as if she had at once grown and grown and 
grown, grown in all sorts of ways save the most 
natural one of growing visibly older. Such an 
oddity as that made her another person a good 
deal more than her show of not having left him 
behind by any break with their common youth 
could keep her the same. 

These perceptions took of course but seconds, 
with yet another on their heels, to the effect that 
she had already seen him, and seen him to some 
fine sense of pleasure, as himself enormously 
different — arriving at that clearness before they 
had done more than thus waver between the 
"fun," all so natural, of their meeting as the 
frankest of friends and the quite other intelligence 
of their being parties to a crisis. It was to re- 
main on record for him too, and however over- 
scored, that their crisis, surging up for three or 
four minutes by its essential force, suffered them 
to stand there, with irrelevant words and mo- 
tions, very much as if it were all theirs alone and 
nobody's else, nobody's more important, on 
either side, than they were, and so take a brush 
from the wing of personal romance. He let her 
hands go, and then, if he wasn't mistaken, held 
them afresh a moment in repeated celebration, 





 

he exchanged with her the commonest remarks 
and the flattest and the easiest, so long as it wasn't 
speaking but seeing, and seeing more and more, 
that mattered: they literally talked of his jour- 
ney and his arrival and of whether he had had a 
good voyage and wasn't tired; they said "You 
sit here, won't you?" and "Shan't you be better 
there?"— they said "Oh I'm all right!" and 
"Fancy it's happening after all like this!" be- 
fore there even faintly quavered the call of a 
deeper note. This was really because the deep 
one, from minute to minute, was that acute hush 
of her so clearly finding him not a bit what she 
might have built up. He had grown and grown 
just as she had, certainly; only here he was for 
her clothed in the right interest of it, not bare 
of that grace as he fancied her guessing herself 
in his eyes, and with the conviction sharply thrust 
upon him, beyond any humour he might have 
cultivated, that he was going to be so right fori 
her and so predetermined, whatever he did and 
however he should react there under conditions) 
incalculable, that this would perhaps more over- 
load his consciousness than ease it. It could 
have been further taken for strange, had there 
been somebody so to note it, that even when 
their first vaguenesses dropped what she really 
at once made easiest for him was to tell her that 
the wonderful thing had come to pass, the thing 
she had whisked him over for — he put it to her 





 

that way; that it had taken place in conditions 
too exquisite to be believed, and that under the 
bewilderment produced by these she must re- 
gard him as still staggering. 

"Then it's done, then it's done — as I knew it 
would be if he could but see you." Flushed, but 
with her large fan held up so that scarce more 
than her eyes, their lids drawn together in the 
same nearsighted way he remembered, presented 
themselves over it, she fairly hunched her high 
shoulders higher for emphasis of her success. The 
more it might have embarrassed her to consider 
him without reserve the more she had this relief, 
as he took it, of her natural, her helpful blink- 
ing; so that what it came to really for her general 
advantage was that the fine closing of the eyes, 
the fine thing in her big face, but expressed effec- 
tive scrutiny. Below her in stature — as various 
other men, for that matter, couldn't but be — he 
hardly came higher than her ear; and he for the 
shade of an instant struck himself as a small 
boy, literally not of man's estate, reporting, under 
some research, just to the amplest of mothers. 
He had reported to Mr. Betterman, so far as 
intent candour in him hadn't' found itself dis- 
traught, and for the half hour had somehow af- 
fronted the immeasurable; but that didn't at 
all prevent his now quick sense of his never in 
his life having been so watched and waited upon 
by the uncharted infinite, or so subject to its 





 

operation — since infinities, at the rate he was 
sinking in, could apparently operate, and do it 
too without growing smaller for the purpose. 
He cast about, not at all upright on the small 
pink satin sofa to which he had unconsciously 
dropped; it was for him clearly to grow bigger, 
as everything about expressively smiled, smiled 
absolutely through the shadow cast by doctors 
and nurses again, in suggestion of; which, nat- 
urally, was what one would always want to do — 
but which any failure of, he after certain mo- 
ments perfectly felt, wouldn't convert to the 
least difference for this friend. How could that 
have been more established than by her neglect 
of his having presently said, out of his particular 
need, that he would do anything in reason that 
was asked of him, but that he fairly ached with 

the desire to understand    ? She blinked upon 

his ache to her own sufficiency, no doubt; but 
no further balm dropped upon it for the moment 
than by her appearing to brood with still deeper 
assurance, in her place and her posture, on the 
beauty of the accomplished fact, the fact of her 
performed purpose and her freedom now but to 
take care — yes, herself take care — for what would 
come of it. She might understand that he didn't 
— all the way as yet; but nothing could be more 
in the line of the mild and mighty mother than 
her treating that as a trifle. It attenuated a 
little perhaps, it just let light into the dark warmth 





 

of her spreading possession of what she had done, 
that when he had said, as a thing already ten 
times on his lips and now quite having to come 
out, "I feel some big mistake about me somehow 
at work, and want to stop it in time ! " she met 
this with the almost rude decision of "There's 
nothing you can stop now, Graham, for your 
fate, or our situation, has the gained momentum 
of a rush that began ever so far away and that 
has been growing and growing. It would be too 
late even if we wanted to — and you can judge 
for yourself how little that's my wish. So here 
we are, you see, to make the best of it." 

"When you talk of my 'fate,'" he allowed 
himself almost the amusement of answering, "you 
freeze the current of my blood; but when you 
say 'our situation,' and that we're in it together, 
that's a little better, and I assure you that I 
shall not for a moment stay in anything, what- 
ever it may be, in which you're not close beside 
me. So there you are at any rate — and I matter 
at least as much as this, whatever the mistake: 
that I have hold of you as tight as ever you've 
been held in your life, and that, whatever and 
whatever the mistake, you've got to see me 
through." 

"Well, I took my responsibility years ago, and 
things came of it" — so she made reply; "and the 
other day I took this other, and now this has 
come of it, and that was what I wanted, and 





 

wasn't afraid of, and am not afraid of now — like 
the fears that came to me after the Dresden 
time." No more direct than that was her answer 
to his protest, and what she subjoined still took 
as little account of it. "I rather lost them, those 
old fears — little by little; but one of the things 
I most wanted the other day was to see whether 
before you here they wouldn't wholly die down. 
They're over, they're over," she repeated; "I 
knew three minutes of you would do it — and not 
a ghost of them remains." 

"I can't be anything but glad that you 
shouldn't have fears — and it's horrid to me to 
learn, I assure you," he said, "that I've ever 
been the occasion of any. But the extent to 
which," he then frankly laughed, " 'three min- 
utes ' of me seems to be enough for people ! " 

He left it there, just throwing up his arms, 
passive again as he had accepted his having to 
be in the other place; but conscious more and 
more of the anomaly of her showing so markedly 
at such an hour a preoccupation, and of the very 
intensest, that should not have her father for its 
subject. Nothing could have more represented 
this than her abruptly saying to him, without 
recognition of his point just made, so far as it 
might have been a point: "If your impression 
of your uncle, and of his looking so fine and being 
so able to talk to you, makes you think he has 
any power really to pick up or to last, I want 





 

you to know that you're wholly mistaken. It 
has kept him up," she went on, "and the effect 
may continue a day or two more — it will, in fact, 
till certain things are done. But then the flicker 
will have dropped — for he won't want it not to. 
He'll feel all right. The extraordinary inspira- 
tion, the borrowed force, will have spent itself — 
it will die down and go out, but with no pain. 
There has been at no time much of that," she 
said, "and now I'm positively assured there's 
none. It can't come back — nothing can but the 
weakness. It's too lovely," she remarkably 
added — "so there indeed and indeed we are." 

To take in these words was to be, after a fashion 
he couldn't have expressed, on a basis of reality 
with her the very rarest and queerest; so that, 
bristling as it did with penetrative points, her 
speech left him scarce knowing for the instant 
which penetrated furthest. That she made no 
more of anything he himself said than if she had 
just sniffed it as a pale pink rose and then tossed 
it into the heap of his other sweet futilities, such 
another heap as had seemed to grow up for him 
in his uncle's room, this might have pressed 
sharpest hadn't something else, not wholly over- 
scored by what followed, perhaps pricked his 
consciousness most. " 'It,' you say, has kept 
him up? May I ask you what 'it' then may so 
wonderfully have been ?" 

She had no more objection to say than she 




 

apparently had difficulty. "Why, his having 
let me get at him. That was to make the whole 
difference." 

It was somehow as much in the note of their 
reality as anything could well be; which was 
perhaps why he could but respond with "Oh 
I see!" and remain lolling a little with a sense 
of flatness — a flatness moreover exclusively his 
own. 

So without flatness of her own she didn't even 
mind his; something in her brushed quite above 
it while she observed next, as if it were the most 
important thing that now occurred to her: "That 
of course was my poor father's mistake." And 
then as Gray but stared: "I mean the idea that 
he can pick up." 

"It's your father's mistake that he can ?" 

She met it as if really a shade bewildered at his 
own misconception; she was literally so far off 
from any vision of her parent in himself, a phi- 
losopher might have said, that it took her an 
instant to do the question justice. "Oh no — I 
mean that your uncle can. It was your own re- 
port of that to him, with Miss Mumby backing 
you, that put things in the bad light to him." 

"So bad a light that Mr. Gaw is in danger by 
it ? " This was catching on of a truth to realities 
— and most of all to the one he had most to face. 
"I've been then at the bottom of that?" 

He was to wonder afterwards if she had very 




 

actually gone so far as to let slip a dim smile for 
the intensity of his candour on this point, or 
whether her so striking freedom from intensity 
in the general connection had but suggested to 
him one of the images that were most in opposi- 
tion. Her answer at any rate couldn't have had 
more of the eminence of her plainness. "That 
you yourself, after your uncertainties, should 
have found Mr. Betterman surprising was per- 
fectly natural — and how indeed could you have 
dreamed that father so wanted him to die?" 
And then as Gray, affected by the extreme salience 
of this link in the chain of her logic, threw up his 
head a little for the catching of his breath, her 
supreme lucidity, and which was lucidity all in 
his interest, further shone out. "Father is in- 
deed ill. He has had these bad times before, but 
nothing quite of the present gravity. He has 
been in a critical state for months, but one thing 
has kept him alive — the wish to see your uncle 
so far on his way that there could be no doubt. 
It was the appearance of doubt so suddenly this 
afternoon that gave him the shock." She con- 
tinued to explain the Case without prejudice. 
"To take it there from you for possible that 
Mr. Bettenman might revive and that he should 
have in his own so unsteady condition to wait 
was simply what father couldn't stand." 

"So that I just dealt the blow ?" 

But it was as if she cared too little even to try 




 

to make that right. "He doesn't want, you see, 
to live after." 

"After having found he is mistaken?" 

She had a faint impatience. "He isn't of 
course really — since what I told you of your 
uncle is true. And he knows that now, having 
my word for it." 

Gray couldn't be clear enough about her clear- 
ness. "Your word for it that my uncle has re- 
vived but for the moment?" 

"Absolutely. Wasn't my giving him that," 
Rosanna asked, "a charming filial touch?" 

This was tremendously much again to take in, 
but Gray's capacity grew. "Promising him, you 
mean, for his benefit, that my uncle shan't last ? " 

The size of it on his lips might fairly, during 
the instant she looked at him, have been giving 
her pleasure. "Yes, making it a bribe to father's 
patience." 

"Then why doesn't the bribe act?" 

"Because it comes too late. It was amazing," 
she pursued, "that, feeling as he did, he could 
take that drive to the Bradhams' — and Miss 
Mumby was right in perfectly understanding 
that. The harm was already done — and there 
it is." 

She had truly for the whole reference the most 
astounding tones. "You literally mean then," 
said Gray, "that while you sit here with me he's 
dying — dying of my want of sense ?" 





 

"You've no want of sense" — she spoke as if 
this were the point really involved. "You've 
a sense the most exquisite — and surely you had 
best take in soon rather than late," she went on, 
"how you'll- never be free not to have on every 
occasion of life to reckon with it and pay for it." 

"Oh I say!" was all the wit with which he 
could at once meet this charge; but she had 
risen as she spoke and, with a remark about there 
being another matter, had moved off to a piece 
of furniture at a distance where she appeared 
to take something from a drawer unlocked with 
a sharp snap for the purpose. When she returned 
to him she had this object in her hand, and Gray 
recognised in it an oblong envelope, addressed, 
largely sealed in black, and seeming to contain 
a voluminous letter. She kept it while he noted 
that the seal was intact, and she then reverted 
not to the discomfiture she had last produced in 
him but to his rueful reference of a minute be- 
fore that. 

"He's not dying of anything you said or did, 
or of anyone's act or words. He's just dying of 
twenty millions." 

"Twenty millions?" There was a kind of 
enormity in her very absence of pomp, and Gray 
felt as if he had dropped of a sudden, from his 
height of simplicity, far down into a familiar 
relation to quantities inconceivable — out of which 
depths he fairly blew and splashed to emerge, 





 

the familiar relation, of all things in the world, 
being so strange a one. " That's what you mean 
here when you talk of money ?" 

"That's what we mean," said Rosanna, "when 
we talk of anything at all — for of what else but 
money do we ever talk? He's dying, at any 
rate," she explained, "of his having wished to 
have to do with it on that sort of scale. Having 
to do with it consists, you know, of the things 
you do for it — which are mostly very awful; and 
there are all kinds of consequences that they 
eventually have. You pay by these consequences 
for what you have done, and my father has been 
for a long time paying." Then she added as if 
of a sudden to summarise and dismiss the whole 
ugly truth: "The effect has been to dry up his 
life." Her eyes, with this, reached away for the 
first time as in search of something not at all 
before her, and it was on the perfunctory note 
that she had the next instant concluded. "There's 
nothing at last left for him to pay with." 

For Gray at least, whatever initiations he had 
missed, she couldn't keep down the interest. 
"Mr. Gaw then will leave twenty millions -?" 

"He has already left them — in the sense of 
having made his will; as your uncle, equally to 
my knowledge, has already made his." Some- 
thing visibly had occurred to her, and in connec- 
tion, it might seem, with the packet she had 
taken from her drawer. She looked about — 





 

there being within the scene, which was somehow 
at once blank and replete, sundry small scattered 
objects of an expensive negligibility; not one of 
which, till now, he could guess, had struck her 
as a thing of human application. Human ap- 
plication had sprung up, the idea of selection at 
once following, and she unmistakeably but won- 
dered what would be best for her use while she 
completed the statement on which she had so 
strikingly embarked. "He has left me his whole 
fortune." Then holding up an article of which 
she had immediately afterwards, with decision, 
proceeded to possess herself, "Is that a thing 
you could at all bear?" she irrelevantly asked. 
She had caught sight, in her embarrassed way, 
of something apparently adapted to her unex- 
plained end, and had left him afresh to assure 
herself of its identity, taking up from a table 
at first, however, a box in Japanese lacquer only 
to lay it down unsatisfied. She had circled thus 
at a distance for a time, allowing him now 
his free contemplation; she had tried in succes- 
sion, holding them close to her eyes, several em- 
bossed or embroidered superfluities, a blotting- 
book covered with knobs of malachite, a silver 
box, flat, largely circular and finely fretted, a 
gold cigar case of absurd dimensions, of which 
she played for a moment the hinged lid. Such 
was the object on which she puzzlingly chal- 
lenged him. 





 

"I could bear it perhaps better if I ever used 
cigars." 

"You don't smoke?" she almost wailed. 

"Never cigars. Sometimes pipes — but mostly, 
thank goodness, cigarettes." 

"Thank the powers then indeed!" — and, the 
golden case restored to the table, where she had 
also a moment before laid her prepared missive, 
she went straight to a corner of the mantel-shelf, 
hesitations dropping from her, and, opening there 
a plainer receptacle than any she had yet touched, 
turned the next instant with a brace of cigarettes 
picked out and an accent she had not yet used. 
"You are a blessing, Gray — I'm nowhere without 
one !" There were matches at hand, and she had 
struck a light and applied it, at his lips, to the 
cigarette passively received by him, afterwards 
touching her own with it, almost before he could 
wonder again at the oddity of their transition. 
Their light smoke curled while she went back to 
her table; it quickened for him with each puff 
the marvel of a domestic altar graced at such a 
moment by the play of that particular flame. 
Almost, to his fine vision, it made Rosanna dif- 
ferent — for wasn't there at once a gained ease in 
the tone with which, her sealed letter still left 
lying on the table, she returned to that conve- 
nience for the pocket of the rich person of which 
she had clicked and re-clicked the cover? What 
strange things, Gray thought, rich persons had ! 





 

— and what strange things they did, he might 
mentally even have added, when she developed 
in a way that mystified him but the more: "I 
don't mean for your cigars, since you don't use 
them; but I want you to have from my hand 
something in which to keep, with all due con- 
sideration, a form of tribute that has been these 
last forty-eight hours awaiting you here, and 
which, it occurs to me, would just slide into this 
preposterous piece of furniture and nestle there 
till you may seem to feel you want it." She pro- 
ceeded to recover the packet and slide it into 
the case, the shape of which, on a larger scale, 
just corresponded with its own, and then, once 
more making the lid catch, shook container and 
contents as sharply as she might have shaken a 
bottle of medicine. "So — there it is; I some- 
how don't want just to thrust at you the letter 
itself." 

"But may I be told what the letter itself is ?" 
asked Gray, who had followed these movements 
with interest. 

"Why of course — didn't I mention? Here 
are safely stowed," she said, her gesture causing 
the smooth protective surfaces to twinkle more 
brightly before him, "the very last lines (and 
many there, appear to be of them !) that, if I am 
not mistaken, my father's hand will have traced. 
He wrote them, in your interest, as he considers, 
when he heard of your arrival in New York, and, 





 

having sealed and directed them, gave them to 
me yesterday to take care of and deliver to you. 
I put them away for the purpose, and an hour 
ago, during our drive back from Mrs. Bradham's, 
he reminded me of my charge. Before asking 
Miss Mumby to tell you I should like to see you 
I transferred the letter from its place of safety 
in my room to the cabinet from which, for your 
benefit, I a moment ago took it. I carefully 
comply, as you see, with my father's request. 
I know nothing whatever of what he has written 
you, and only want you to have his words. But 
I want also," she pursued, "to make just this 
little affair of them. I want" — and she bent her 
eyes on the queer costliness, rubbing it with her 
pockethandkerchief— "to do what the Lord Mayor 
of London does, doesn't he ? when he offers the 
Freedom of the City; present them in a precious 
casket in which they may always abide. I want 
in short," she wound up, "to put them, for your 
use, beautifully away." 

Gray went from wonder to wonder. "It isn't 
then a thing you judge I should open at 
once r 

"I don't care whether you never open it in 
your life. But you don't, I can see, like that 
vulgar thing!" With which having opened her 
receptacle and drawn forth from it the subject 
of her attention she tossed back to its place on 
the spread of brocade the former of these trifles. 





 

The big black seal, under this discrimination, 
seemed to fix our young man with a sombre 
eye; 

"Is there any objection to my just looking at 
the letter now?" And then when he had taken 
it and yet was on the instant and as by the mere 
feel and the nearer sight, rather less than more 
conscious of a free connection with it, " Is it going 
to be bad for me ? " he said. 

"Find out for yourself!" 

"Break the seal?" 

"Isn't it meant to break?" she asked with a 
shade of impatience. 

He noted the impatience, sounding her nervous- 
ness, but saw at the same time that her interest 
in the communication, whatever it might be, was 
of the scantest, and that she suffered from having 
to defer to his own. "If I needn't answer to- 
night !" 

"You needn't answer ever." 

"Oh well then it can wait. But you're right 
— it mustn't just wait in my pocket." 

This pleased her. "As I say, it must have a 
place of its own." 

He considered of that. "You mean that when 
I have read it I may still want to treasure it ?" 

She had in hand again the great fan that hung
