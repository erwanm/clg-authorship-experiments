enigmatically urging, " Suffer it to be, for now," he 
waded into the water and received from the awed 
and trembling hands of his kinsman the rite of ded- 
ication to a religious life. But when he came up 
out of the shining river the people had run down 
the banks of the stream, and many of them stood 
collected to see the newcomer, about whose baptism 
there seemed to be something of special interest 
which they had missed. They had scrambled along 
chattering, but a quietness fell on them when they 
reached the spot. For the look on the faces of the 
two young men was not a thing to gossip in the 
presence of, however much or long one might talk 
of it in after times. 

And, while the whole group stood, thoughtful, a 
cream-white dove that had been flying to and fro 
across Jordan rose high in the heavens and swept 
out of sight. The stranger had fixed his gaze upon 
the flight o the dove; and, thus, dripping with 
gleaming water, with upraised faee, he seemed en- 
tirely preoccupied with the movements of the bird. 
John, wondering at his absorption in this trifle, drew 
near to observe the other, and, seoing that he was at 
prayer, reverently drew back. The bird swept into 
jaight again ; graceful, snowy, palpitating like a thing 
half bird, half lily, pure as the film of the cloud, 
through which it descended slowly. The dove 
dipped toward the water, and with a few encircling 
movements settled gently upon the head of Jesus, 



74 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

whose uplifted countenance it seemed to study with 
that strange distance which the observation of a 
bird puts between itself and a human face, as if it 
came from a sphere too high to touch humanity. 
Almost before one could say that it had rested upon 
the man, it had ascended from him and melted into 
the sky. 

A little murmur ran through the crowd at the 
beautiful sight; the people, who must always talk 
of whatever happens, turned to say something' each 
to his neighbor. But Jesus and John, who did not 
speak, listened with held breath. Again their eyes 
met solemnly, each with a question in them. 

" Didst thou hear aught ? " 

" Didst thou ? " . . , 

Afterwards a strange thing was said about the 
dove. It was reported that John, whoso severe and 
honorable word was not to be doubted, had hoard 
intelligible sounds from the heavens when the bird 
swept from the sky upon the head o the newly-bap- 
tized man; it was added thut the other luul himself 
heard them, and more than these, juul that the 
words had a meaning which no man dbo could un- 
derstand. 

Some said that this wastlio Bath-cpl, or Daughter 
Voice, common to the ovor-oxcitod imagination of the 
Jews, by which those who were quite ready to be- 
lieve in it found their affairs regulated, business, 
marriage, travel, and the like. 

But there were those wlio shook their heads and 
observed with significance that Jolni was not a 
man to trouble himself about the Daughter Voice* 



A BEAUTIFUL SCENE 75 

It was said that the stranger, standing in the Jordan 
with the light of a fresh religious vow upon his 
lifted face, with prayer in his eyes and the dove 
circling to his brow, had been identified of Heaven 
(John being witness to the fact) in mystical lan- 
guage : 

" My beloved son ! " What manner of words 
were these ? " I am well pleased with thee ! " What 
should be made of it ? 

There were not wan-ting philosophers and dreamers 
as well as common folk, who claimed that John and 
his kinsman had indeed heard that to which other 
oars were deaf : for it was well known to Oriental, 
students that there are senses beyond the familiar 
five whose culture is within a man's own control, and 
whoso grasp may roach strange facts, both of the 
mind and o the body; and whose witness of the 
marvelous no man loss devout, less pure, less edu- 
cated in higher truth than he who testifies thereof 
has the right to dispute. At all events, it could 
not be denied that the beautiful baptismal scene 
on Jordan bade fair to become a public event of 
marked importance. 

The newly-baptized man was quickly made aware 
that ho had become the centre of observation. The 
followers oE the young prophet, half irresolute be- 
tween the two, looked from one to the other with 
their piercing Jewish eyes. Certain of the bolder 
in the throng proBRcd curiously forward towards the 
stranger : a Pharisee in full phylactery and a He- 
brew merchant, both bent, it was clearly to be seen, 
on a good bout of polemics ; a Koman citizen and a 



76 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

Greek traveler followed with the more nonchalant 
interest o men of the world in a passing episode. 

But the Nazarene, stunned with the awful creden- 
tials which John had given over to him, and thrill- 
ing with the mystical experience of the past hour, 
turned abruptly away. 

With bowed head he passed through the shivering 
river reeds in the direction of the desert. 



CHAPTER HI 
THE WILDEKNESS 

FKOM an early Jewish writer have come down to 
us these fine words : " The Holy One, blessed be 
His Name, does not elevate a man to dignity till He 
has first tried and searched him ; and if he stands 
in temptation, then He raises him to dignity." 

Overwhelmed with the events of the day, Jesus 
sought the solitude which it was his first and his 
second nature to love. There was nothing better 
to be clone for the crowd at that moment than to 
gratify its curiosity, which he had no disposition 
to do ; ho escaped it, and, pushing through the reeds 
which grow above his tall height, left the river 
rapidly behind him. 

Tho Judoan desert was, of all the wildernesses to 
to be found in the vicinity of civilization, one of the 
most dreary and uncanny. The Jews, with grim 
succinctness, called it The Horror, The Appalling 
Desolation. 

Josus walked strongly and quickly. After a few 
hours lie fouud himself at the foot of the western 
hills, in a moro desolate region and quite alone. 
Day was declining ; and the heads and shoulders of 
the bare chalk hills were at their kindest colors in 
the mellow before the sunset ; but these were cold 



78 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

enough. Flint-bound ridges looked icily at each 
other, as if they intimated dark thoughts which they 
were forbidden to communicate. No sign of life 
was visible except the birds of the desert, and now 
and then one of its sly, wild animals. A few stray 
thrushes uttered melancholy notes. A black grackle 
with yellow wings flew over the traveler's head and 
rose, vanishing. Vultures circled low in grim spots 
about the landscape. An unseen fox, or desert par- 
tridge, waiting for the dark, slipped stealthily among 
the rocks. 

Westward, valleys of tremendous depth already 
held the night. Passage through them was not to 
be thought of, they were so steep and doc]), except 
in their troughs below. Southward this grim coun- 
try was impassable. Far away lay the only inhab- 
ited spot in the desert, a town, Engedi by name, 
A few reservoirs, in hard limestone, held the only 
water of the thirsty landscape. There wore talus of 
terrible torrents in winter and spring, and gorges of 
incredible depth told the story of the rush of fvottli- 
ets from the heights. On the hills grew only the 
plants that ask no water ; dry, sinister, with a nkiu 
prickly to the touch. In the valloyw a wliito broom 
thickened courageously, but this Moonusd iai March. 
In the summer the desert wan :i land of drought. In 
the winter it held the chill and the ropulHivxmoHH of 
the grave. In the night it had the outliuoH and the 
shadows of sorcery, of the supernatural* of the ter- 
rors that come after the grave. 

Night was coming on. Jetius climbed to the front 
of a high cliff, and looked about him, Ho saw the 



THE WILDERNESS 79 

chalk of the midland hills sloping from three thou- 
sand feet yonder, near Hebron, to half that height 
at the valley of the Dead Sea. He saw a country 
of caves and gorges, of secrecy, of shadow, of un- 
clean and venomous creatures, of skulking things 
and hiding men. For he remembered that there 
were men who chose the desert for their only home ; 
hermits and philosophers, robbers and refugees from 
justice, and those weary of life ; dwellers in caves 
and brooders upon mystery. One of these came out 
from a cavern that gaped black below the cliff on 
whose edge the Nazarene was standing, stared up at 
him sulkily for a moment with gaunt eyes, and flit- 
ted away like a bat. This momentary sign of human 
life served only to emphasize the sense of desolation 
hanging over the place. 

The swift Oriental night swept on in large masses. 
The long Hues of the gorges took on frightful pro- 
portions in the gloom, One came upon them unex- 
pectedly. A false stop might hurl a man to a tomb 
in which lie would never be found. The solitary, 
feeling lus way slowly through the twilight, op- 
pressed by thought too tense to be aware of danger, 
suddenly drew back. His foot had struck the edge 
of a chasm, yawning thirty or forty feet across his 
way ; he peered over ; the bottom lay at the least a 
thousand foot clown. 

Tho sun was now quite set, and the chill of night 
was descending. Jesus, perceiving that it would 
be impracticable to continue his wanderings, sought 
swili shelter for the night as the inhospitable place 
afforded, a cleft in the rook, an uninhabited cave, 



80 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

a cushion of the dry plants that had no thirst, and 
that seemed when he touched them like an unnatural 
form of organism which shrank from him. The 
stars sprang out and the dew fell. Ravens croaked 
in some dismal distance. A rare viper, whose lair 
he had disturbed, hissed at his feet. The hills, in 
the darkness, took on portentous forms. The val- 
leys sank away from the solid earth like bottomless 
pits. He had eaten nothing for some hours, ami 
it did not occur to him to provide himself with food. 
His mind and heart were in a tumult which lie found 
it difficult to understand or to calm. 

The scenes and events of the day returned like 
doors folding upon themselves ; through their aper- 
tures he passed and repassed. The long, dusty walk ; 
vanished Nazareth ; the watchful tree* that guarded 
Jordan ; the tall reeds ; the gleaming river ; the 
crowds lining the stream ; the face and figure of the 
young prophet, his impassioned wortls, IUH burning 
eyes, his sudden recognition, liis beautiful oUeisanee ; 
the touch of the cool water; the emotion* with 
which the sacred rite had been aecei>te<l, -- followed 
fast in turn again. In the dead dark of Iho clofwrt 
the shining of the white dove glimmered from the 
sky. From the silence of the wilderness throbbed 
up the echo of The Voice: "Thou thmi art My 
beloved Son. " 

The dull ear had not heard it, nor the <leuf with 
pettiness and worlcllmesH and viao. The HCWHOH of 
the pure spirit understood it, for to them it Bpolco.

things, life, death, truth, his own past, his own

THE WILDERNESS 81 

future, his duty, and his fate, could not doubt that 
he had heard from the Invisible these to most men 
inaudible words. The thrill of them was on him 
yet. Whence did they come ? WHO uttered them ? 
What did they mean ? What did they involve in 
him who had been chosen by their solemn articula- 
tion ? It were a deadly thing to mistake a syllable 
of them. What depended upon their correct com- 
prehension? The course of a whole life's history 
must be decided in a few days and nights of thought 
and solitude ; but that, to the watcher in the desert, 
was the least of his problem. The fate of an ancient 
people, the fulfillment of a great hope and of stately 
prophecy, the outcry of humanity, the pitiable pas- 
sion of the earth, crowded upon his consciousness. 
" Thou ithalt carry tl\Q sins of the world." 
These words pursued him. The scream of a night- 
bird in the desert cried across them ; the howling of 
a wolf, the barking of a jackal in the distance min- 
gled with them ; the winds in the caves would have 
drowned them, but they rang on. Where and when 
had he heard them ? Wore they the refrain of some 
poem hi the literature of his people? The echo 
o au ancient pant ? Or were they the forecast of 
an impending future? Six weeks later these were 
dcHtinod to be almost the first words which should 
meet IUH oars when he returned to the habitations of 
mem, Tho voice of his young kinsman, he half com- 
manding as a prophet whould, would qxiiver with this 
salutation. JCRUR might have been astonished to 
discover in himself, as he paced the wilderness, the 
first, faiut intimation of those extra senses which 



82 THE STOEY OF JESUS CHRIST 

men call preaudience or prevision ; but he was too 
far buried in greater and deeper thought and feeling 
to dwell as yet upon the simpler signs of a new and 
startling endowment. He who had but an hour 
since heard the voice of God did not tarry with the 
mystery of his own nature. 

"Thou shalt carry the sins of the world, . . , tJiou 
Lamb of God." 



Suddenly, bleating and piteous, flashed back the 
face of a lamb that he had seen on that first time 
when, a lad, he went to the Temple, a white, ten- 
der thing, clinging to its butchers, blooding! Ho 
saw the entreaty in its dumb eyes, their last an- 
guish ; the red hands of the priest ; smoke and firo 
on the dripping altar. . . . 

Day dawned without cheer. Tho outlines of the 
great hill Quarantana, prominent because the last; 
peak of a western ridge, and ending in it sheer preci- 
pice, rose frowning. The watcher directed his stepn 
towards it, and, climbing to its front, looked off over 
the dismal landscape which ho had ohoflcu as the 
setting to the crisis of his life. Tho cast broke 
grayly with a sickly, purplish mock of amirine. Tho 
scorpions crawled into their hiding plueoH sullenly, 
and rooks croaked somewhere close sit em-. A few 
moving blots among the caves in the proeipioo in- 
dicated the presence of the miserable human benign 
who knew no other homes than tlri jigged country ; 
they were seeking their morning meal, '1C von that 
starving fare was not for the Nazarouo; he found

THE WILDERNESS 83 

ger that was not to be of short duration, and from 
which he shrank, as all men do from the opening 
stage of any form of long-continued suffering. 

For that he had come to the crisis of his life his 
clear perception could not doubt. A threefold pres- 
sure crowded upon him and within him, the views 
of other men, the movements of his own soul, and 
the voice of God. 

The thought of his young kinsman was plain 
enough to read. John saw in Jesus the material for 
a great reformer, of spotless personal character, 
to be sure, of positive religious fervor, of irreproach- 
able motives; mysteriously (for who knew, when 
one came to this, just what John meant?) mys- 
teriously favored of Heaven, but a great leader of 
men ; ordained to hold masses in his power, and 
fated to be an immense personal success, such a suc- 
cess as the devout mind of the young ascetic on the 
banks of Jordan would consider inseparable from 
the career of the chosen of God, the Messiah of a 
px*ou(l people. 

Yet the views of John as to the nature and duties 
of the Jewish Messiah were as far in advance of 
those hold by the majority of his hearers as his life 
was purer than a Roman gentleman's, or nobler 
than a Hebrew Pharisee's. 

JOSUB was too well-educated a man, too thoroughly 
learned in Hebrew literature, to be at all misled as 
to the kind of hero whom the Hebrews expected, 
awaited, and would honor. 

In himself he did not find the material for any 
such ideal as his people passionately cherished. All 



84 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

the traditions of his race pointed one way. The 
instincts of his own nature drew him in another. 
Between them, gently as the dove had floated from 
the sky in the afternoon light on Jordan, descended 
the whisper of God. But saying what ? . . . 

His strong eye ran from the low-lying foreground 
to the heights of Moab and Gilead steadily. Who 
was he a young man, unknown, unbefriendod, in- 
experienced, a rustic from Nazareth that ho should 
take upon himself the most solemn claims possible 
to his people or his faith ? What wus ho that ho 
should parley with Jehovah ? How should ho pre- 
sume to translate The Voice from Heaven? 

"I will remain in this wilderness until 1 do." 
This resolve formed itself in his consciousness with- 
out explicit words, as one familiar with ji foreign 
language translates it without transposition to his 
own tongue. Resolutely putting in the background 
of his mind his personal discomfort; his fthai*]>cmmg 
hunger, the gusts of sickening faintuoss that swopt 
upon him, his suffering from the noo<l of sloop, and 
the sense of loneliness so much more acute in a 
delicate than in a dull organisation, ho held him- 
self down among the creatures of the dosoH;, liko 
one of them. There he called on the gonius of soli- 
tude and the angel of self -cloprivat -ion, as all nion 
must who would approach God, to holp him in the 
first great definite battlo of a spiritual contont des- 
tined to last till his final breath should be drawn in 
agony, and his final prayer ascend in poacje. 

** 

Day succeeded night and week followed upon 



THE WILDERNESS 85 

week. With the natural respect of an Oriental and 
of a Hebrew for long-sustained fasts and seclusion, 
it did not occur to Jesus that he was subjecting 
himself to unreasonable rigors ; in fact, his personal 
comfort was the last of all topics in his thoughts. 
His emotion far transcended all common interrup- 
tions to its current, whose depth and strength did 
but increase under bodily suffering. 

A lesser man, acting under a meaner motive, 
might in the presence of admiring spectators have 
subjected himself to surprising feats in starvation, 
or burial, or physical contortion, or to the vagaries 
of voluntary and unnecessary martyrdom, seeking 
thereby personal glory enough to pay for the pro- 
cess. But this noble enthusiast, simply, without 
calculation, without witnesses, swept on the stream 
o a great impulse, suffered in solitude and in night, 
and in perplexity, to what end? That his soul 
might know itself and its God ; that he might learn 
his duty and do it. Yet was he no angel, but a 
man ; and his human suffering encroached upon his 
strength. lie weakened and sickened. Visions of 
food swam before his eyes. Pictures of home, of 
friends, of long-needed sleep, o his own rug in his 
mother's house, of her tender face, her gentle min- 
istration, the evening meal prepared by her quiet 
hands, blurred against the dark background of the 
desert. lie romomberod that no one had sought

own leaves, sprang out everywhere to his strained 
eye; the cliffs hung heavy with purpling grapes; 
and the mouth of the cave rioted with fig and olive, 
blazed with luscious melon, crimsoned with alluring 
pomegranate. 

He put out his hand, and the teeth of the lime- 
stone bruised him. Fresh, unleavened bread hot 
from the oven, for the meal of a sacred clay's use, 
stood smoking on the ground; . . . see! piled in 
loaves against the feet of the rock. Ho staggered 
up and stooped over to pick it up. . . . Stone I 
stone as cold as the sepulchre, and as sharp as fam-

Night was coming on ; the shadows of the desert 
took monstrous shapes ; on the brain disordered by 
a fast already prolonged past the limits of torment, 
strange impressions were stamped. Uncanny talcs 
came back to memory. Sorcery and witchcraft and 
demonology were allies to assault the intelligence 
and the self-possession of a starving num. Half- 
delirious dreams chased each other through a burn- 
ing brain. The pains of hunger, -which are outlived 
in the earlier stages of starvation, had ncamjly re- 
ceived attention in their timo ; for the greatness of 
his emotion had not suffered them. Now the fatal 
and inexorable symptoms of the final failure of 
human strength within a faininlied body drew on. 
Delirium and syncope were close at luuul. Food 1 
food ! He crept down the mountain to a cleft in, the 
rock where water had collected and dashed' it in His 
haggard face. 



THE WILDERNESS 87 

Suddenly within him, like the groping, griping 
hands of a strong man fighting in the dark, uprose 
the movement of a something never felt before, 
new forces in his soul ; strange senses of the spirit, 
superinduced upon those of his fainting body; the 
shadows of coming gifts, of advancing possibilities, 
of unknown facilities of action and unguessed powers 
of will. What were these? Whence did they come? 
Whither would they lead him? What should he 
do with them ? 

He sat with his famished eyes fastened upon an 
oval, flat stone at his feet ; it had the shape of 
shew-bread, such as the priests baked for their own 
food. He picked the stone up and handled it curi- 
ously. A thrill like the joy of feasting ran. from 
his fingers through his whole sinking body. At that 
moment he perceived that he had but to open his 
lips and speak two words : " Become bread I " for 
the rocks of the wilderness were his. The hard 
heart of the limestone would melt like dough be- 
ueath his touch. Tho resources of the desert would 
obey him. Starvation was his servant. The laws 
of human life were his slaves. He had but to 
speak. . . . 

Ho did not speak. He laid the stone down and 
it was but a stone. The famished man put his hands 
before his face and trembled, but not with physical 
anguish; and bowed himself to the earth in the 
dark, but not with bodily weakness. His whole 
boiixg shook with the shock of a great moral escape. 

It seemed to his delicate sense of spiritual honor 
that the exertion of a great and sacred gift to selfish 



88 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

ends were a heinous desecration. All the principali- 
ties and powers of the desert air might summon their 
cohorts against his starving weakness, but he who 
had heard The Voice from the sky above the river had 
other uses for his sense of power, this new, thrill- 
ing, mystical power to do, to be, to dream, to act the 
Will of God Almighty ; not his own. No, never 
his own ; from this first moment in the knowledge 
that he was not like other men, to the last hour of 
his dedicated life, never his own will, for his own 
sake, for his own ends, for his own comfort. 

There was another way. There was a nobler ex- 
ercise for latent and mysterious strength. 

The fasting solitary lifted his hands, his face, to 
the heavens. Food ? Yes, a man must have food. 
But of what kind ? It was easier for the starving 
body to be nourished by the mind and heart of God 
than for the starving soul to live on broad alone. 
In his great exaltation, this profound thought seemed 
to rest at his drawn and fevered lips like a chalice. 
Perishing, he drank life from it. 

He had now reached that stage of physical ex- 
haustion when the mind, nearly or quite freed from 
its usual dependence upon the senses, rules in a 
world of its own. Vision upon vision KWIUU before 
him ; these had the proportions of nullity ; sight, 
touch, hearing recognized them, and other fuoultioH, 
unknown, unnamed, took hold of them. Yet Inn

was as if they rolled and tiurolled over the oxpanwo

THE WILDERNESS 89 

eye could not compass them where he was, and, 
weakly crawling up, he managed to reach the nearest 
height above him, where bleak Quarantana looked 
down coldly on the darkening valleys. Here, soli- 
tary, observant, silent, he sank upon the rock. 

Swarming below, he saw the people of his race, 
mad with hero-worship, but pugnacious to create 
their own hero, prostrating themselves at his feet. 
Their hot huzzas ascended to his ears. They were 
such a throng that their dark, bright, Oriental eyes 
rolled like the little waves of a great lake. Their 
spokesman held up a flashing thing, a crown ! 
Purple robes and sceptre, signets, jewels, flights of 
flashing marble steps, fountains, gardens, palisades, 
the ante-rooins of a palace, slaves, flowers, banquets, 
perfumes from behind the silken curtains of un- 
entered, unseen apartments, swept trembling by. 
Stately emissaries of Gentile dignitaries awaited 
audience of him. Gentile nations, for his sake,

nous delusion of ' serving the ptiblic weal. 



90 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

Was thatwh&t The Voice on Jordan meant to say ? 
Did the white wing of The Dove brush his bowed 
and humble head for that ? 

Nay, nay. " Him only shalt thou serve ! " The 
besieged man flung himself upon the visions of the 
night of the desert, of his own powerful imagina- 
tion and keen intellect, as if they had been spirits 
of the nether world, and as if it depended upon 
himself alone in all the universe to force the rebel- 
lion of moral guilt into subjection to imperial Good. 

Ah, the Temple ! Splendid, glittering, marble and 
gold; priests and altars; worshipers crowding up 
and down ; the bleeding, burning lambs ; the groat 
and gorgeous sacred veil, stiff with embroidery of 
blue, of purple, of crimson, of white, with golden 
cherubim wrought thereon; the hidden ark; the 
Holy of Holies! 

He passed through the Gate Beautiful, and wan- 
dered in and out. He readied the exquisite colon- 
nade of Solomon's Porch, climbed the highest pin- 
nacle, and there stood looking down and off. The 
gorge of Kedron yawned below him, throe hun- 
dred and fifty feet sheer down. The brook lay like 
a bubble below. What a leap ! . . . 

Yonder in the courts the people thronged. Some 
were looking up: they had caught night of him 
above ; they were speaking to one another about him. 
Jerusalem lay blazing in the sun ; the boat of the 
day was breaking; people wore coming from their 
houses ; the markets were opening, the Htroeta wore 
filling, the whole world was there to oe. What u 



THE WILDERNESS 91 

fall ! What a feat ! What a wonder ! It were only 
to leave this hideous den of death and night ; to 
break this mortal fast ; to gather strength to make 
the journey by the fire of his soul, to be in the 
Sacred City. When ? How? Perhaps by the will- 
ing of a wish, by the motion of a foot, by the out- 
stretching of an arm. Who knew how the strange 
powers within him, newly discovered, freshly lighted, 
dulled only by famine and desolation, waiting for 
their nourishment, crying for their exercise, would 
bestir themselves ? 

He felt it in his thrilling consciousness that he 
could have floated over that parapet, and descended 
among the gaping crowd withoxit a bruise. So great 
was his exaltation, so mighty his sense of untried, 
undeveloped faculties, at this moment, that the mar- 
vel seemed even small to him. It meant but the 
ordering of a purpose ; it meant but a turn of the 
will. It meant that the allegiance, the adoration of 
his race, were his, and his forever. It meant that 
precious thing, of all the ambitious of earth or 
heaven most bewitching to a Jewish mind, abso- 
lixte recognition as their Messiah. It meant none 
the less a devout life than this starvation in the 
dcsort, nay, rather, meant it all the more. It meant 
the most godlike, the holiest career of which the 
Hebrew imagination could conceive. It meant the 
uao of a marvelous power. How? Not as God 
directed ; that was all. Simply uot as the Author 
of all Powers did ordain. It meant putting a great 
gift to a doubtful exorcise ; superseding known laws 
by the unknown, to gratify paltry curiosity and the 



92 THE STOET OF JESUS CHRIST 

lowest form of superstition. It meant doing as he 
chose, not as God had chosen. Searching- in him- 
self passionately for light and law, he found but 
this : that, if a man wished to do the will of God, to 
him it should be made known. Was it The Will 
that he should capture Jerusalem by a great, dra- 
matic exhibition of arts such as an Indian occultist 
might claim to practise ? To become the King of 
the Jews, should he suffer himself to be thought the 
king of sorcerers ? God was mystery, but He was 
not magic. The dignity in Christ's own nature re- 
volted from this view of his position. In his reac- 
tion from his momentary moral confusion, so near 
did he come to the Invisible that it seemed to him 
as if Jehovah himself had been assaulted in his own 
being ; and, rising to his full height, and crushing 
the sharp stones beneath his bruised feet, ho apos- 
trophized the whole source and force of evil an if it 
were one malicious intelligence : 

" Thou shalt not try the Lord thy Clod ! " 
Every temptation needs its desert;, and every 
desert has its temptation. The true nature of bin 
moral trial now began to sitggcnt itself to the Nn#a- 
rene. What his race and Inn times would demand 
of him that he could not give. What ho luul the 
power to achieve that ho might not do. It came 
slowly to his awed and gentle thought to wonder if 
he had been mistaken in daring to suppose that he 
could be the Anointed, the Chosen of his people 
and of his people's God* 

The very opening hulieations of IUH nuHBion took 
on the character of an error into which lie had

nearly fallen, an abyss into which he had all but 
slipped ; as he might slip into that fissure yonder 
below the mountains, fifteen hundred feet yawning 
down. 

With his unapproachable humility, his royal care- 
lessness of self, he put his splendid visions by. If 
he might not be the Messiah of the Jews, he could 
be not the less the Son of God. If not for him 
the sceptre and gems and the purple of life, he 
could still be a plain, good man, doing his duty in 
an obscure fashion as God bade him, and trust- 
ing Heaven to teach him what and where it was. 
With this simple and this grand resolve, lie turned 
to leave the desert, and to seek the homely and 
natural presence of men. 

But on the brow of the hill he fell fainting. He 
had 'come to the end of bis strength, and uncon- 
sciousness compassionately found him out at last. 

When he came to himself, he heard in the dark 
the movement of dim, strange forms, stately and 
merciful as his most cherished dreams of the strong- 
est angel in the heavenly world. He heard inar- 
ticulate, brooding sounds of tenderness beyond the 
teinlorness of earth. The grasp of unseen fingers 
touched his wasted hands. Vitality that had never 
known a pang or weakness flowed through the clasp. 
So the spent and famished man was comforted. 
And day dawned xtnou the wilderness.
