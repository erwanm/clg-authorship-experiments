delicately broached either subject he had been 
met with a polite indifference, that had little in 
common with the cordiality otherwise shown him. 
He foresaw that he might be obliged to reveal the 



 

more pressing object of his visit without further 
diplomacy, and the thought irritated him beyond 
endurance. 

Whether Concha were giving him her promised 
aid he had no means of discovering, and herein 
lay another cause of his general vexation. He 
had dined every day at the Comandante's, 
danced there every night. Concha had been vivacious, friendly — impersonal. Not so much as a 
coquettish lift of the brow betrayed that the distinguished stranger eclipsed the caballeros for 
the moment; nor a whispered word that he retained the friendship she had offered him on the 
day of their meeting. He had not, indeed, had a 
word with her alone. But his interest and admiration had deepened. It was evident that her 
father and the Governor adored her, would deny 
her little. Her attitude to them was alternately 
that of the petted child and the chosen companion. 
As her mother was indisposed she occupied her 
place at the table, presiding with dignity, guiding 
the conversation, revealing the rare gift of making everyone appear at his best. In the evening 
she had sometimes danced alone for a few moments, but more often with her Eussian guests, 
and readily learning the English country-dances 




they were anxious to teach. Eezanov would have 
found the gay informality of these evenings delightful had his mind been at ease about his Sitkans, and Concha a trifle more personal. He had 
begun by suspecting that she was manoeuvring 
for his scalp, but he was forced to acquit her ; for 
not only did she show no provocative favor to 
another, but she seemed to have gained in dignity 
and pride since his arrival, actually to have kissed 
her hand in farewell to the childhood he had been 
so slow in divining; grown — he felt rather than 
analyzed — above the pettiness of coquetry. Once 
more she had stirred the dormant ideals of his 
early manhood; there were moments when she 
floated before his inner vision as the embodiment 
of the world's beauty. Nor ever had there been 
a woman born more elaborately equipped for the 
position of a public man's mate; nor more ingenerate, perhaps, with the power to turn earth 
into heaven. 

He had wondered humorously if he were fallen 
in love, but although he retained little faith in 
the activities of the heart after youth, he was beginning seriously to consider the expedience of 
marrying Concha Argiiello. He had not intended 
to marry again, and it was this old and passionate 




love of personal freedom that alone iield him 
back, for nothing would be so advantageous to the 
Kussian colonies in their present crisis as a strong 
individual alliance with California. Concha Argiiello was the famous daughter of its first subject, 
and with the powerful friends she would bring to 
her husband, the consummation of ends dearer to 
his heart than aught on earth would be a matter of 
months instead of years. And he thrilled with 
pride as he thought of Concha in St. Petersburg. 
Two years of court life and she would be one of the 
greatest ladies in Europe. That he could win her 
he believed, and without undue vanity. He had 
much to offer an ambitious clever girl conscious 
of her superiority to the men of this province of 
Spain, and chafing at the prospect of a lifetime in 
a bountiful desert. His only hesitation lay in his 
own doubt if she were worth the loss of his freedom, and all that word involved to a man of his 
position and adventurous spirit. 

He shrugged his shoulders at this argument; 
he had walked off some of his ill-humor, and reverted willingly to a theme that alone had given 
him satisfaction during the past few days. 
At the same time he made a motion as if flinging 
aside an old burden. 





It is time for such nonsense to end," he 
thought contemptuously. " And in truth these 
three years have wrought such changes in me I 
doubt I should have patience for an hour of the 
old trifling. My greatest need from this time on, 
I fancy, is work. I could never be idle a month 
again. And when a man is in love with work — 
and power — and has passed forty — does he want 
a constant companion! That is the point. At my 
time of life power exercises the most irresistible 
and lasting of all fascinations. A man that wins 
it has little left for a woman." 

He had reached the summit of the rocky out- 
post, the highest of the hills where the peninsula 
turned abruptly to the south, and, scrupulously 
refraining from a downward glance at the Battery 
of Yerba Buena, stood looking out over the bay 
to the eastern mountains : dark, almost formless, 
wrapped in the intense and menacing mystery of 
that last hour before dawn. 

" Seiior ! " called a low cautious voice. 

Eezanov stepped hastily back from the point 
of the bluff and glanced about in wonder, his 
pulses suddenly astir. But he could see no one. 

"Senor! " 

This time the direction was unmistakable, and 




he went to the edge of the plateau facing the south 
and looked over. Half-way down a shallow and 
almost perpendicular gully, he saw a girl 
forcing a mustang up the harsh loose path. The 
girl's white and oval face looked from the 
folds of a black reboso like the moon emerging 
from clouds, and its young beauty was out of 
place in that wild and forbidding setting. She 
reined in her horse as she caught his eye and 
beckoned superfluously; then guided her mustang 
to a little ledge where he could plant his feet 
firmly, permitting her to reassume her usual 
pride of carriage and averting the danger of a 
sudden scramble or need of assistance. 

As Eezanov reached her side she gave him a 
grave and friendly smile, but no opportunity to 
kiss her hand. 

" I have followed your excellency,'' she said. 
" I saw you leave the Juno and as I am often 
up at this hour, and as no one else ever is, my 
father ignores the fact that I sometimes ride 
alone. I have never come as far as this before, 
but there is something I wish to say to you, and 
there is no opportunity at home. I asked Santiago to find me one last night, but he was in a bad 
temper and would not. Men! However — I suppose you have heard nothing of the cargo ? ' ' 



 

" I have not, ' ' said Rezanov grimly, although 
acutely sensible that the subject suited neither 
his mood nor the hour. 

" But the Governor has ! Madre de Dios ! all 
the women of the Presidio and the Mission have 
pestered him. They are sick with jealousy at the 
shawls you gave us that day — those that did not 
go to the ship. How clever of your excellency to 
give us just enough for ourselves and nothing for 
our friends ! And those that went want more and 
more. They have called upon him — one, two, 
four, and alone. They have wept and scolded and 
pleaded. I did not know until yesterday that your 
commissary had also shown the things to the 
priests from San Jose — Father Jose Uria and 
Father Pedro de la Cueva. They and the priests 
of San Francisco have argued with the Governor 
not once but three times. Dios ! how his poor excellency swore yesterday. He threatened to return at once to Monterey. I flew into a great rage 
and threatened in turn to follow with all the other 
girls and all the priests, vowed he should not have 
one moment of peace until that cargo was ours." 

" Well! '' asked Rezanov sharply, in spite of 
his amusement. 

Concha shook her head. '' When he does not 




swear he answers only: ' Buy if yon have the 
money. I have never broken a law of Spain and 
I shall not begin in my old age.' He knows well 
that we have no money to send out of New Spain ; 
but I have conceived a plan, senor. It is for 
you, not for me, to suggest it. You will never 
betray that I have been your friend, Excellency ? ' ' 

" I will swear it if you wish," said Eezanov 
frigidly. 

"" Pardon, senor. If I thought you could I 
should not be here. One often says such things. 
This is the plan: You shall suggest that we buy 
your wares, and that you buy again with our 
money. The dear Governor only wants to save 
his conscience an ache, for we have driven him 
nearly distracted. I am sure he will consent, for 
you will know how to put it to him very diplomatically. ' ' 

" But if he refused to understand, or his con- 
science remained obdurate? I should then have 
neither cargo nor ballast.'' 

'' He would never trick a guest, nor would ho 
let the money go out of the country. And he 
knows well how much we need your cargo and 
longs to be able to state in his reports that he 
sold you a hold full of breadstuffs. Moreover, I 




think the time has come to tell him of the dis- 
tress at Sitka. He is very soft-hearted and is 
now in that distracted state of mind where only 
one more argument is required. I hope I have 
given you good advice, Excellency. It is the best 
I can think of. I have given it much thought, and 
the terrible state of those miserable creatures has 
kept me awake many nights. I must return now. 
Will your excellency kindly remain here until I 
am well on my way! — and then return by the 
beach? I shall go as I came, through the valley. 
Neither of us can be seen from the Battery. ' ' 

" I will obey all your instructions," said Eezanov. But he did not move, nor could the mustang. Concha smiled and pointed to the other 
side of the cleft, which was about as wide as a 
narrow street. 

" Pardon, senor, I cannot turn.'' 

For a moment Eezanov stared at her, through 
her. Then his heavy eyes opened and flashed. It 
seemed to him that for the first time he saw how 
beautiful, how desirable she was, set in that gray 
volcanic rock with the heavens gray above her 
and the stars fading out. It was not the bower 
he would have imagined for the wooing of a 
mate, but neither moonlight nor the romantic 




glades of La Bellissima could have awakened in 
him a passion so sudden and final. Her face between the black folds turned whiter and she 
shrank back against the jagged wall; and when 
his eyes flashed again with a wild eager hope she 
involuntarily crossed herself. He threw himself 
against the horse and snatched her down and 
kissed her as he had kissed no woman yet, recognizing her once for all. 

When he finally held her at arm's length for a 
moment he laughed confusedly. 

" The Eussian bear is no longer a figure of 
speech,' he said. " Forgive me. I forgot that 
you are as tender as you are strong.'' 

Her hands were tightly clasped against her 
breast, and the breath was short in her throat, 
but she made no protest. Her eyes were radiant, 
her mouth was the only color in that gray dawn. 
In a moment she too laughed. 

" Dios de mi alma! What will they say? A 
heretic! If Tamalpais fell into the sea it would 
not make so great a sensation in this California 
of ours where civilized man exists but to drive 
heathen souls into the one true church." 

" Will it matter to you! Are you strong 
enough? It will be only a question of time to win 
them over, if you are." 



 

She nodded emphatically. " I was born with 
strength. Now — Dios! — now I can be stronger 
than the King of Spain himself, than the Governor, my parents and all the priests — You would 
not become a Catholic! " she asked abruptly. 

He shook his head, although he still smiled at 
her. " Not even for you. ' ' 

" No," she said thoughtfully. " I will confess 
— what matters it! — I often dreamed that this 
would come just because I believed it would not. 
But why should one control the imagination when 
it alone can give us happiness for a little while! 
I gave it reign, for I thought that one-half of all 
my life was to be passed in that unreal but by no 
means niggardly world. And I thought of everything. To change your religion would mean the 
ruin of your career; moreover, it is not a possibility of your character. Were it I think I 
should not love you so much. Nor could I 
bear to think of any change in you. Only it will 
be harder — longer.'' Then she stretched out her 
hand, and closed and opened it slowly. The most 
obtuse could not have failed to read the old simile 
of the steel in the velvet. " I shall win because 
it is my nature — and my power— to hold what I 
grasp. ' ' 



 

" But if tliey persistently refuse- 



" Dios ! " she interrupted him. " Do you think 
that your love is greater than mine? I was born 
with a thousand years of love in me and had 
you not come I should have gone alone with my 
dreams to the grave. I am all women in one, 
not merely Concha Argiiello, a girl of sixteen." 
She clasped her hands high above her head, lifting her eyes to the ashen vault so soon to yield 
to the gay brush of dawn. 

" Before all that great mystery, " she said 
solemnly, " I give myself to you forever, how 
much or how little that may mean here on earth. 
Forever.'' 



iXVI 

The Comandante of the San Francisco Company sat opposite Kezanov with his mouth open, 
the lines of his strong face elongated and relaxed. 
It was the hour of siesta, and they were alone in 
the sala. 

" Mother of God! " he exclaimed. " Mother 
of God! Are you mad, Excellency? " 

" No man was ever saner, " said Rezanov cheerfully. " What better proof would you have than 
this final testimony to Doha Concha's perfections? '' 

" But it cannot be! Surely, Excellency, you 
realize that ! The priests ! Ay yi ! Ay yi ! ' ' 

" I think I understand the priests. Persuade 
the Governor to buy my cargo and they will look 
upon me as an amicus humasii generis to whom 
common rules do not apply. And I have won 
their sincere friendship.'' 

'' You have won mine, sehor. But, though I 
say it, there is no more devout Catholic in the 
Californias than Jose Argiiello. Do you know 
what they call me? El santo. God knows I am 




not, but it is not for want of the wish. Did I 
give my daughter to a heretic, not only should I 
become an outcast, a pariah, but I should imperil 
my everlasting soul and that of my best beloved 
child. It is impossible. Excellency— unless, indeed, you embrace our faith. ' ' 

" That is so impossible that the subject is not 
worth the waste of a moment. But surely, Comandante, in your excitement at this perfectly 
natural issue you are misrepresenting yourself. 
I do not believe, devout Catholic as you are, that 
your soul is steeped in fanaticism. You are known 
far and wide as the first and most intelligent of 
his Catholic Majesty's subjects in New Spain. 
When you have my word of honor that your 
daughter 's faith shall never be disturbed, it is impossible you should believe that marriage with 
me would ruin her chances of happiness in the 
next world. But I doubt if your soul and conscience will have the peace you desire if you ruin 
her happiness in this. What pleasure do you find 
in the thought of an old age companioned by a 
heart-broken daughter? '' 

Don Jose turned pale and hitched his chair. 
" Other maids have been balked when young, and 
have forgotten. Concha is but sixteen " 




" She is also unique. She will marry me or 
no one. Of that I am as certain as that she is the 
woman of women for me. ' ' 

'' How can you be so certain! " asked the Comandante sharply. " Surely you have had little 
talk alone with her? '' 

'"' The heart has a language of its own. Eecall 
your own youth, sehor." 

" It is true," said Don Jose with a heavy sigh, 
as he had a fleeting vision of Dona Ignacia, slim 
and lovely at the grating, with a rose in her hair. 
" But this tremendous passion of the heart— it 
passes, seiior, it passes. We love the good wife, 
but we sometimes realize that we could have loved 
another good wife as well." 

'' That is a bit of philosophy I should have 
uttered myself, Comandante — yesterday. But 
there are women and women, and your daughter 
is one of the chosen few who take from the years 
what the years take from others. I am not rushing 
into matrimony for the sake of a pair of black 
eyes and a fine figure. I have outlived the possibility of making a fool of myself if I would. Be- 
fore I realized how deeply I loved your daughter 
I had deliberately chosen her out of all the women 
I have known, as my friend and companion for 



 

the various and difficult ways of life which I shall 
be called upon to follow. Your daughter will have 
a high place at the Kussian Court, and she will 
occupy it as naturally as had I found her in 
Madrid and you in the great position to which 
your attainments and services entitle you." 

Don Jose, despite his consternation, titillated 
agreeably. He privately thought no one in New 
Spain good enough for his daughter, and his 
weather-beaten self was not yet insensible to the 
rare visitation of winged darts tipped with honey. 
But the situation was one of the most embarrassing he had ever been called upon to face, and perhaps for the first time in his direct and honest 
life his resolution was shaken in a crisis. 

" Believe me, your excellency, I appreciate the 
honor you have done my house, and I will add 
with all my heart that never have I liked any man 
more. But-Mother of God! Mother of God! " 

Rezanov took out his cigarette case, a superb 
bit of Eussian enamel, graven with the Imperial 
arms, and a parting gift from Alexander. He 
passed it to his host, who had developed a prefer- 
ence for Russian cigarettes. 

( i There are other things to consider besides the 
happiness of your daughter and myself," he remarked. " This alliance would mean the con- 
solidation of Spanish and Russian interests on the 
Pacific coast. It would mean the protection of 
California in the almost certain event of American ' aggression. And I hear that a courier 
brought word again yesterday that the Russian 
and the Spanish fleets had sailed for these waters. 
I do not believe a word of it ; but should it be true, 
I would remind you of two things : that I have the 
powers of the Tsar himself in this part of the 
world, and that the Russian fleet is likely to arrive 
first. " 

Again the Comandante moved uneasily. The 
news from Mexico had kept himself and the Governor awake the better part of the night. He 
fully appreciated the importance of this powerful 
Russian's friendship. Nothing would bind and 
commit him like taking a Calif ornian to wife. If 
only he had fallen in love with Carolina Ximeno or 
Delfina Rivera! Don Jose had an uneasy suspicion that his scruples as a Catholic might have 
gone down l)efore his sense of duty to this poor 
California. But a heretic in his own family! He 
was justly renowned for his piety. Aside from 
the wrath of the church, the mere thought of one 
of his offspring in matrimonial community be- 




yond its pale made him sick witli repugnance. 
And yet— California! And he would have selected 
Eezanov for his daughter out of all men had he 
been of their faith. And he was deeply conscious 
of the honor that had descended, however unfruitfully, upon his house. Madre de Dios ! How 
would it end? Suddenly he felt himself inspired. 
In blissful ignorance of her subtle feminine rule, 
he reminded himself that Concha's mind was the 
child of his own. When she saw his embarrassment, filial duty and woman's wit would extricate 
them both with grace and avert the enmity of the 
Russian even though the latter 's more personal 
interest in California must die in his disappointment. He would make her feel the weight of the 
stern paternal hand, and then indicate the part 
she had to play. 

He rang a bell and directed the servant to sum- 
mon his daughter, drew himself up to his full 
height and set his rugged face in hard lines. As 
Concha entered he looked the Comandante, the 
stern disciplinarian, every inch of him. 

There was no trace of the siesta in Concha's 
cheeks. They were very white, but her eyes were 
steady and her mouth indomitable as she walked 
down the sala and took the chair Eezanov placed 



 

for her. Except for her Castilian fairness, she 
looked very like the martinet sitting on the other 
side of the table. The Comandante regarded her 
silently with brows drawn together. Dimly, he 
felt apprehension, wondered, in a flash of insight, 
if girls held fast to the parental recipe, or recombined with tongue in the cheek. The bare possi- 
bility of resistance almost threw him into panic, 
but he controlled his features until the effort injected his eyes and drew in his nostrils. Concha 
regarded him calmly, although her heart beat 
unevenly, for she dreaded the long strain she foresaw. 

" My daughter,'' said Don Jose finally, his 
tones harsh with repressed misgiving, " do you 
suspect why I have sent for you I " 

" I think that his excellency wishes to marry 
me," replied Concha; and the Comandante was 
so staggered by the calm assurance of her tone 
and manner that his pent-up emotion exploded. 

'' Dios! " he roared. " What right have you 
to know when a man wishes to marry you? What 
manner of Spanish girl is this? Truly has his 
excellency said that you are not as other women. 
The place for you is your room, with bread and 
water for a week. Sixteen! " 



 

" Ignacio was born when my mother was six- 
teen," said Concha coolly. 

" What of that! She married whom and when 
she was told to marry.' 

" I have heard that you serenaded nightly beneath her grating " 

'' So did others." 

" I have heard that when of all her suitors her 
father chose one more highly bom, a gentleman 
of the Viceroy's court, she pined until they gave 
their consent to her marriage with you, lest she 
die." 

" But I was a Catholic ! The prejudice against 
my birth was an unworthy one. I had distinguished myself. And she had the support of the 
priests." 

" It is my misfortune that M. de Rezanov is not 
a Catholic, but it will make no difference. I shall 
not fall ill, for I am like you, not like my dear 
mother— and the education you have given me is 
very different from hers. But I shall marry his 
excellency or no one, and whether I marry him 
or live alone with the thought of him until the 
end of my mortal days, I do not believe tliat my 
soul will be imperilled in the least." 

" You do not! " shouted the irate Spaniard. 



 

" How dare you presume to decide sucli a question for yourself? WKat does a woman know of 
love until she marries! It is nothing but a sickening of the imagination before; and if the man 
goes, the doctor soon comes. " 

" You may not have intended— but you have 
taught me to think for myself. And I have seen 
others besides M. de Rezanov— the flower of California and more than one fine gentleman from 
Mexico. I will have none of them. I will marry 
the man of my choice or no one. It may be that 
I know naught of love. If you wish you may 
think that my choice of a husband is determined 
by ambition, that I am dazzled with the thought 
of court life in St. Petersburg, of being the consort of a great and wealthy noble. It matters, 
not. Love or ambition, I shall marry this Russian 
or I shall never marry at all. ' ' 

'' Mother of God! Mother of God! '' Don 
Jose's face was purple. The veins swelled in his 
neck. He was the more wroth because he recognized his own daughter and his own handiwork, 
because he saw that he confronted a Toledo 
blade, not a woman's brittle will, such as he had 
grown old in knowledge of. Concha regarded him 
calmly. 




" If you refuse your consent you will lose me 
in another way. I may not be able to marry as 
I wish, but I will have no worldly alternative. I 
shall join the Third Order of the Franciscans, and 
enter a convent as soon as one is built in California. To that you cannot withhold your consent, 
or they no longer would call you El Santo.'' 

Don Jose leapt from his chair. " Go to your 
room! " he thundered. " And do not dare to 
leave it without my permission " 

But Concha sprang forward and flung herself 
upon his neck. She rubbed her warm elastic cheek 
against his own in the manner he loved, and softened her voice. " Papacito mio, papacito mio,'' 
she pleaded. " Thou wilt not refuse thy Concha 
the only thing she has ever begged of thee. And 
I beg ! I beg ! Papa mio ! I love him ! I love him. ! ' ' 
And she broke into wild weeping and kissed him 
frantically, while Eezanov, who had followed her 
plan of attack and resistance in silent admiration, 
did not know whether he should himself be moved 
to tears or further admire. 

Don Jose pushed her from him with a heavy 
sob and hastily left the room, oblivious in the 
confusion of his faculties of the boon he conferred 
on the lovers. Concha dried her eyes, but her 



 

face was deathly pale. It had not been all acting 
by any means, and she was beginning to feal the 
tyranny of sleepless nights; and the joy and wonder of the morning had left her with bnt a rem- 
nant of endurance for the domestic battleground. 
" Go,' she whispered. " Return for the dance 
to-night as if nothing had happened— I forgot, 
there is to be a bull-bear fight in the square. So 
much the better, for it is in your honor, and you 
could not well remain away. There is much' 
trouble to come, but in the end we shall win. ' ' 



XVII 

The muscles in Dona Ignacia's cheeks fell an 
inch as she listened, dumfounded, to the tale 
her husband poured out. To her simple aristocratic soul Eezanov had loomed too great a personage to dream of mating with a Calif ornian; 
and as her sharp maternal instinct had recog- 
nized his personal probity, even his gallantries 
had seemed to her no more consequent than the 
more catholic trifling of his officers. 

' ' Holy Mary ! " she whimpered when her voice 
came back. " Holy Mary! A heretic! And he 
would take our Concha from us ! And she would 
go! To St. Petersburg! Ten thousand miles! 
To the priests with her — now — this very day! " 

Concha had thrown herself on her bed in belated hope of siesta, when Malia (Rosa had been 
sent to the house of Don Mario Sal in the valley) 
entered with the message that she was to accompany her parents to the Mission at once. She 
rose sullenly, but in the manifold essentials of a 
girl's life she had always yielded the implicit 
obedience exacted by the Californian parent. In 



 

a few moments slie was riding out of the Presidio 
beside her father. Dona Ignacia jolted behind 
in her carreta, a low and clumsy vehicle, on solid 
wheels and springless, drawn by oxen, and ariven 
by a stable-boy on a mustang. The journey was 
made in complete silence save for the maledictions addressed to the oxen by the boy, and an occasional : " Ay yi ! ' ' '' Madre de Dios ! ' "  Sainted 
Mary, but the sun bores a hole in the head,'' 
from Doha Ignacia, whose increasing discomfort 
banished wrath and apprehension for the hour. 

Don Jose did not even look at his daughter, but 
his face was ten years older than in the morning. 
He had begun dimly to appreciate that she was 
suffering, and in a manner vastly different from 
the passionate resentment he had seen her display when the contents of a box from Mexico 
disappointed her, or she was denied a visit to 
Monterey. That his best-beloved child should 
suffer tore his own heart, but he merely cursed 
Eezanov and resolved to do his best to persuade 
the Governor to yield to his other demands, that 
California might be rid of him the sooner. 

Father Abella was walking down the long outer 
corridor of the Mission reading his breviary, and 
praying he might not be diverted from righteousness by the comforting touch of his new habit, 
when he looked up and saw the party from the 
Presidio floundering over the last of the sand hills. 
He shuffled off to order refreshments, and returned 
in time to disburden the carreta of Doila Ignacia 
— no mean feat — volubly delighted in the visit and 
the gossip it portended. But as he offered his 
arm to lead her into the sala, she pushed him 
aside and pointed to Concha, who had sprung to 
the ground unassisted. 

" She has come to confess, padre! '' she excaimed, her mind under the deep tiled roof of 
the corridor readjusting itself to tragedy. " I 
beg that you will take her at once. Padre Landaeta can give us chocolate and we will tell our 
terrible news to him and receive advice and consolation. ' ' 

Father Abella, not without a glimmering of the 
truth, for better than anyone he understood the 
girl he had confessed many times, besides himself having succumbed to the Eussian, led the 
way to the confessional in some perturbation of 
spirit. He walked slowly, hoping that the long 
cool church, its narrow high windows admitting 
so scant a meed of sunlight that no one of its worshippers had ever read the painted legends on 



 

the walls, and even the stations were but deeper 
bits of shade, would attune her mind to holy- 
things, and throw a mantle of unreality over 
those of the world. 

He covered his face with his hand as she told 
her story. This she did in a few words, disjointed, for she was both tired and seething. For 
a few moments afterward there was a silence ; the 
good priest was increasingly disturbed and by no 
means certain of his course. He was astonished 
to feel a tug at his sleeve. Before he could reprove this impenitent child for audacity she had 
raised herself that she might approach her lips 
more closely to his ear. 

" Mi padre! '' she whispered hoarsely, " you 
will take my part ! You will not condemn me to 
a life of misery ! I am too proud to speak openly 
to others — but I love this man more than my soul 
— more than my immortal soul. Do you hear? I 
am in danger of mortal sin. Perhaps I am already in that state. You cannot save me if he 
goes. I will not pray. I will not come to the
