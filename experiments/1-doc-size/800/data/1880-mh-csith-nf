For the speedy issue of which, the petitioner doth humbly pray.

NOTE.

    In looking over this book the reader will notice certain
    receipts marked thus—. I do not claim for these greater
    merit than should of right be accorded to many others. I
    merely wish to call the attention of the novice to them as
    certainly safe, and for the most part simple. Every one
    thus marked has been tried by myself; most of them are in
    frequent, some in daily use, in my own family.

    My reason for thus singling out comparatively a small number
    of receipts from the rest, is the recollection of my own
    perplexities—the loss of time and patience to which I have
    been subjected in the examination of a new cookery-book,
    with an eye to immediate use of the directions laid down
    for various dishes. I have often and vainly wished for a
    finger-board to guide me in my search for those which were
    easy and sure, and which would result satisfactorily. This
    sort of directory I have endeavored to supply, taking care,
    however, to inform the reader in advance that, so far as I
    know, there is not an unsafe receipt in the whole work.

    Of course it was not necessary or expedient to append the
    above sign to plain “roast and boiled,” which are in common
    use everywhere.




SOUPS.


THE base of your soup should always be uncooked meat. To this may be
added, if you like, cracked bones of cooked game, or of underdone beef
or mutton; but for flavor and nourishment, depend upon the juices of
the meat which was put in raw. Cut this into small pieces, and beat the
bone until it is fractured at every inch of its length. Put them on in
cold water, without salt, and heat very slowly. Do not boil fast at
any stage of the operation. Keep the pot covered, and do not add the
salt until the meat is thoroughly done, as it has a tendency to harden
the fibres, and restrain the flow of the juices. Strain—always through
a cullender, after which clear soups should be filtered through a
hair-sieve or coarse bobbinet lace. The bag should not be squeezed.

It is slovenly to leave rags of meat, husks of vegetables and bits of
bone in the tureen. Do not uncover until you are ready to ladle out
the soup. Do this neatly and quickly, having your soup-plates heated
beforehand.

Most soups are better the second day than the first, unless they are
warmed over too quickly or left too long upon the fire after they are
hot. In the one case they are apt to scorch; in the other they become
insipid.



VEGETABLE SOUPS.


GREEN PEA. (No. 1.) 

    4 lbs. beef—cut into small pieces.
    ½ peck of green peas.
    1 gallon water.
    ½ cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper and chopped parsley.

Boil the empty pods of the peas in the water one hour before putting
in the beef. Strain them out, add the beef, and boil slowly for an
hour and a half longer. Half an hour before serving, add the shelled
peas; and twenty minutes later, the rice-flour, with salt, pepper and
parsley. After adding the rice-flour, stir frequently, to prevent
scorching. Strain into a hot tureen.


GREEN PEA (No. 2.)

    2 qts. of strong veal or beef broth.
    ½ teaspoonful sugar.
    1 tablespoonful butter.
    1 qt. shelled peas.

Bring the broth to a boil; put in the peas, and boil for twenty
minutes. Add the sugar, and a sprig of green mint. Boil a quarter of an
hour more, and stir in the butter, with pepper and salt, if the broth
be not sufficiently salted already. Strain before serving, and send to
table with small squares of toasted bread floating upon the top.


SPLIT PEA (dried). 

    1 gallon water.
    1 qt. split peas, which have been soaked over night.
    1 lb. salt pork, cut into bits an inch square.
    1 lb. beef, cut into bits an inch square.
    Celery and sweet herbs.
    Fried bread.

Put over the fire, and boil slowly for two hours, or until the quantity
of liquor does not exceed two quarts. Pour into a cullender, and press
the peas through it with a wooden or silver spoon. Return the soup to
the pot, adding a small head of celery, chopped up, a little parsley,
or, if preferred, summer savory or sweet marjoram. Have ready three or
four slices of bread (stale) which have been fried in butter until they
are brown; cut into slices and scatter them upon the surface of the
soup after it is poured into the tureen.


PEA AND TOMATO. 

This is made according to either of the foregoing receipts, in summer
with green—in winter with dried and split peas. Just before straining
the soup, add a quart of tomatoes, which have already been stewed soft;
let the whole come to a good boil, and strain as above directed. If
the stewed tomato be watery, strain off the superfluous liquid before
pouring into the pea soup, or it will be too thin.


BEAN (dried.) 

The beans used for this purpose may be the ordinary kidney, the rice
or field bean, or, best of all, the French mock-turtle soup bean.
Soak a quart of these over night in soft lukewarm water; put them
over the fire next morning, with one gallon of cold water and about
two pounds of salt pork. Boil slowly for three hours, keeping the pot
well covered; shred into it a head of celery, add pepper—cayenne, if
preferred—simmer half an hour longer, strain through a cullender, and
serve, with slices of lemon passed to each guest.

Mock-turtle beans, treated in this way, yield a very fair substitute
for the fine calf’s-head soup known by the same name.


BEAN AND CORN. 

This is a winter soup, and is made of white beans prepared according to
the foregoing receipt, but with the addition of a quart of dried or
canned corn. If the former is used—and the Shaker sweet corn is nearly,
salted corn quite as good for the purpose as the more expensive canned
green corn—soak it overnight in warm water—changing this early in the
morning, and pouring on more warm water, barely enough to cover the
corn, and keeping it in a close vessel until ready to put on the beans.
Let all boil together, with pork as in the bean soup proper. Strain out
as usual, rubbing hard through the cullender. Some persons have a habit
of neglecting the use of the cullender in making bean soup, and serving
it like stewed beans which have been imperfectly drained. The practice
is both slovenly and unwholesome, since the husks of the cereal are
thus imposed upon the digestive organs of the eater, with no additional
nutriment. To the beans and corn may be added a pint of stewed tomato,
if desired.


ASPARAGUS (White soup.)

    3 lbs. veal. The knuckle is best.
    3 bunches asparagus, as well bleached as you can procure.
    1 gallon water.
    1 cup milk.
    1 tablespoonful rice flour.
    Pepper and salt.

Cut off the hard green stem, and put half of the tender heads of the
asparagus into the water with the meat. Boil in closely covered pot for
three hours, until the meat is in rags and the asparagus dissolved.
Strain the liquor and return to the pot, with the remaining half of
the asparagus heads. Let this boil for twenty minutes more, and add,
before taking up, a cup of sweet milk (cream is better) in which has
been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour, arrow-root, or corn-starch.
When it has fairly boiled up, serve without further straining, with
small squares of toast in the tureen. Season with salt and pepper.


ASPARAGUS (Green soup.)

    3 lbs. veal—cut into small pieces.
    ½ lb. salt pork.
    3 bunches asparagus.
    1 gallon water.

Cut the entire stalk of the asparagus into pieces an inch long, and
when the meat has boiled one hour, add half of the vegetable to the
liquor in the pot. Boil two hours longer and strain, pressing the
asparagus pulp very hard to extract all the green coloring. Add the
other half of the asparagus—(the heads only, which should be kept in
cold water until you are ready for them), and boil twenty minutes more.
Then proceed as with the asparagus white soup, omitting the milk,
thickening, and salt. The pork will supply the latter seasoning.


TOMATO (Winter soup.) 

    3 lbs. beef.
    1 qt. canned tomatoes.
    1 gallon water.
    A little onion.
    Pepper and salt.

Let the meat and water boil for two hours, until the liquid is reduced
to little more than two quarts. Then stir in the tomatoes, and stew all
slowly for three-quarters of an hour longer. Season to taste, strain,
and serve.


TOMATO (Summer soup). 

    2½ lbs. veal, or lamb.
    1 gallon water.
    2 qts. fresh tomatoes, peeled and cut up fine.
    1 tablespoonful butter.
    1 teaspoonful white sugar.
    Pepper and salt. Chopped parsley.

Boil the meat to shreds and the water down to two quarts. Strain the
liquor, put in the tomatoes, stirring them very hard that they may
dissolve thoroughly; boil half an hour. Season with parsley or any
other green herb you may prefer, pepper, and salt. Strain again, and
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with a teaspoonful of white sugar,
before pouring into the tureen.

This soup is more palatable still if made with the broth in which
chickens were boiled for yesterday’s dinner.


TURNIP.

    Knuckle of veal, well cracked.
    5 qts. water.

Cover closely and stew gently for four hours, the day before the soup
is wanted. On the morrow, skim off the fat and warm the stock gradually
to a boil. Have ready an onion and six large winter or a dozen small
summer turnips, sweet marjoram or thyme minced very finely. Put these
into the soup and let them simmer together for an hour. Strain:
return to the fire and add a cup of milk—in which has been stirred a
tablespoonful of rice-flour or other thickening—and a tablespoonful of
butter. Season with salt and pepper, let it boil up once, stirring all
the time, as is necessary in all soups where milk is added at last, and
remove instantly, or it will scorch.


POTATO.

    A dozen large mealy potatoes.
    2 onions.
    1 lb. salt pork.
    3 qts. water.
    1 tablespoonful butter.
    1 cup milk or cream.
    1 well-beaten egg.
    Chopped onion.

Boil the pork in the clear water for an hour and a half, then take
it out. Have ready the potatoes, which, after being peeled and
sliced, should lie in cold water for half an hour. Throw them into
the pot, with the chopped onion. Cover and boil three-quarters of an
hour, stirring often. Beat in butter, milk and egg. Add the latter
ingredients carefully, a little at a time; stir while it heats to a
final boil, and then serve.

This is a cheap wholesome dish, and more palatable than one would
suppose from reading the receipt.


GRAHAM SOUP. 

    3 onions.
    3 carrots.
    4 turnips.
    1 small cabbage.
    1 bunch celery.
    1 pt. stewed tomatoes.

Chop all the vegetables, except the tomatoes and cabbage, very finely,
and set them over the fire with rather over three quarts of water. They
should simmer gently for half an hour, at the end of which time the
cabbage must be added, having previously been parboiled and chopped
up. In fifteen minutes more put in the tomatoes and a bunch of sweet
herbs, and give all a lively boil of twenty minutes. Rub through a
cullender, return the soup to the fire, stir in a good tablespoonful of
butter, pepper, and salt, half a cup of cream if you have it, thickened
with corn-starch; let it boil up, and it is ready for the table.


OCHRA, OR GUMBO.

Ochra, or okra, is a vegetable little known except in the far South,
where it is cultivated in large quantities and is very popular. A
favorite soup is prepared from it in the following manner:—

    2 qts. of ochras, sliced thin.
    1 qt. of tomatoes, also sliced.
    4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    2 lbs. of beef, cut into small pieces.
    ½ lb. corned ham or pork, also cut up.

Put the meat and ochras together in a pot with a quart of cold
water—just enough to cover them—and let them stew for an hour. Then
add the tomatoes and two quarts of boiling water—more, if the liquid
in the pot has boiled away so as to expose the meat and vegetables.
Boil three-quarters of an hour longer, skimming often with a silver
spoon. When the contents of the vessel are boiled to pieces, put in
the butter, with cayenne pepper and salt, if the ham has not seasoned
it sufficiently. Strain and send up with squares of light, crisp toast
floating upon it.


CORN. 

    1 large fowl, cut into eight pieces.
    1 doz. ears green corn—cut from the cobs.

Boil the chicken with the cobs in a gallon of water until the fowl is
tender—if tough, the boiling must be slow and long. Then, put the corn
into the pot, and stew an hour longer—still gently. Remove the chicken
with a cupful of the liquid, if you wish to make other use of the meat.
Set this aside, take out the cobs, season the corn-soup with pepper,
salt, and parsley; thicken with rice or wheat flour, boil up once, and
serve without straining, if the corn be young and tender.

A tolerable fricassee may be made of the chicken, unless it has
boiled to rags, by beating up an egg and a tablespoonful of butter,
adding this to the cupful of reserved liquor from which the corn must
be strained. Boil this for a moment, thicken with flour, throw in a
little chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; pour, while scalding, over
the chicken, which you have arranged in a dish; garnish with circular
slices of hard-boiled eggs and curled parsley.



MEAT SOUPS.


BEEF SOUP (à la Julienne). 

    6 lbs. of lean beef. The shin is a good piece for this purpose.
        Have the bones well cracked, carefully extracting the marrow,
        every bit of which should be put into the soup.
    6 qts. of water.

The stock must be prepared the day before the soup is needed. Put the
beef, bones and all, with the water in a close vessel, and set it where
it will heat gradually. Let it boil very slowly for six hours at least,
only uncovering the pot once in a great while to see if there is danger
of the water sinking too rapidly. Should this be the case, replenish
with boiling water, taking care not to put in too much. During the
seventh hour, take off the soup and set it away in a cool place, until
next morning. About an hour before dinner, take out the meat, which
you can use for mince-meat, if you wish; remove the cake of fat from
the surface of the stock, set the soup over the fire, and throw in a
little salt to bring up the scum. When this has been skimmed carefully
off, put in your vegetables. These should be:—

    2 carrots.
    3 turnips.
    Half a head of white cabbage.
    1 pt. green corn—or dried Shaker corn, soaked over night.
    1 head celery.
    1 qt. tomatoes.

These should be prepared for the soup by slicing them very small, and
stewing them in barely enough water to cover them, until they break to
pieces. Cook the cabbage by itself in two waters—throwing the first
away. The only exception to the general dissolution, is in the case
of a single carrot, which should likewise be cooked alone and whole,
until thoroughly done, and set aside to cool, when the rest of the
vegetables, with the water in which they were boiled, are added to the
soup. Return the pot to the fire with the vegetables and stock, and
boil slowly for half an hour from the time ebullition actually begins.
Strain without pressing, only shaking and lightly stirring the contents
of the cullender. The vegetables having been added with all their
juices already cooked, much boiling and squeezing are not needed, and
only make the soup cloudy. Cut the reserved carrot into dice and drop
into the clear liquor after it is in the tureen,—also, if you like,
a handful of vermicelli, or macaroni which has been boiled tender in
clear water.

The seasoning of this excellent soup is a matter of taste. Some use
only salt and white pepper. Others like with this a few blades of mace,
and boil in the stock a handful of sweet herbs. And others fancy that,
in addition to these, a glass of brown sherry imparts a flavor that
renders it peculiarly acceptable to most palates. Send to table very
hot, and have the soup-plates likewise heated.


VEAL SOUP WITH MACARONI. 

    3 lbs. of veal knuckle or scrag, with the bones broken and meat
        cut up.
    3 qts. water.
    ¼ lb. Italian macaroni.

Boil the meat alone in the water for nearly three hours until it is
reduced to shreds; and the macaroni until tender, in enough water to
cover it, in a vessel by itself. The pieces should not be more than an
inch in length. Add a little butter to the macaroni when nearly done.
Strain the meat out of the soup, season to your taste, put in the
macaroni, and the water in which it was boiled; let it boil up, and
serve.

You can make macaroni soup of this by boiling a pound, instead of a
quarter of a pound, in the second vessel, and adding the above quantity
of veal broth. In this case, send on with it a plate of grated cheese,
that those who cannot relish macaroni without this accompaniment may
put it into their soup. Take care that the macaroni is of uniform
length, not too long, and that it does not break while stewing. Add
butter in proportion to the increased quantity of macaroni.


BEEF SOUP (brown).

    3 lbs. beef cut into strips.
    3 onions.
    3 qts. water.

Put beef and water into the saucepan and boil for one hour. Meanwhile,
slice the onions and fry them in butter to a light brown. Drop into the
pot with a teaspoonful of cloves, half as much pepper, same quantity
of mace as pepper, a pinch of allspice, and a teaspoonful of essence
of celery, if you cannot get a head of fresh celery; also half a
teaspoonful of powdered savory or sweet marjoram, and a teaspoonful of
Worcestershire sauce. Stew all for two hours more, or until the beef
has boiled to pieces. Strain the soup and return to the fire. Salt to
taste, and just before taking it off, pour in a glass of brown sherry
or Madeira wine.


MUTTON OR LAMB BROTH. 

    4 lbs. mutton or lamb—lean—cut into small pieces.
    1 gallon water.
    ½ teacupful rice.

Boil the unsalted meat for two hours, slowly, in a covered vessel.
Soak the rice in enough warm water to cover it, and at the end of this
time add it, water and all, to the boiling soup. Cook an hour longer,
stirring watchfully from time to time, lest the rice should settle and
adhere to the bottom of the pot. Beat an egg to a froth and stir into a
cup of cold milk, into which has been rubbed smoothly a tablespoonful
rice or wheat flour. Mix with this, a little at a time, some of the
scalding liquor, until the egg is so far cooked that there is no danger
of curdling in the soup. Pour into the pot, when you have taken out the
meat, season with parsley, thyme, pepper, and salt. Boil up fairly, and
serve. If allowed to stand on the fire, it is apt to burn.

This soup may be made from the liquor in which a leg of mutton has been
boiled, provided too much salt was not put in with it. It is especially
good when the stock is chicken broth. For the sick it is palatable and
nutritious with the rice left in. When strained it makes a nice white
table soup, and is usually relished by all.


VERMICELLI SOUP. 

    4 lbs. lamb, from which every particle of fat has been removed.
    1 lb. veal.
    A slice of corned ham.
    5 qts. water.

Cut up the meat, cover it with a quart of water, and set it back on the
range to heat very gradually, keeping it covered closely. At the end
of an hour, add four quarts of boiling water, and cook until the meat
is in shreds. Season with salt, sweet herbs, a chopped shallot, two
teaspoonfuls Worcestershire sauce, and when these have boiled in the
soup for ten minutes, strain and return to the fire. Have ready about
a third of a pound of vermicelli (or macaroni), which has been boiled
tender in clear water. Add this; boil up once, and pour out.


MOCK-TURTLE OR CALF’S HEAD SOUP. 

    1 large calf’s head, well cleaned and washed.
    4 pig’s feet, well cleaned and washed.

This soup should always be prepared the day before it is to be served
up. Lay the head and feet in the bottom of a large pot, and cover with
a gallon of water. Let it boil three hours, or until the flesh will
slip easily from the bones. Take out the head, leaving in the feet,
and allow these to boil steadily while you cut the meat from the head.
Select with care enough of the fatty portions which lie on the top of
the head and the cheeks to fill a teacup, and set them aside to cool.
Remove the brains to a saucer and also set aside. Chop the rest of the
meat with the tongue very fine, season with salt, pepper, powdered
marjoram and thyme, a teaspoonful of cloves, the same of mace, half
as much allspice, and a grated nutmeg, and return to the pot. When the
flesh falls from the bones of the pig’s feet, take out the latter,
leaving in the gelatinous meat. Let all boil together slowly, without
removing the cover, for two hours more; take the soup from the fire
and set it away until the next day. An hour before dinner, set on the
stock to warm. When it boils strain carefully, and drop in the meat you
have reserved, which, when cold, should be cut into small squares. Have
these all ready as well as the force-meat balls. To prepare these, rub
the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs to a paste in a Wedgewood mortar,
or in a bowl, with the back of a silver tablespoon, adding gradually
the brains to moisten them, also a little butter and salt. Mix with
these two eggs beaten very light, flour your hands, and make this paste
into balls about the size of a pigeon’s egg. Throw them into the soup
five minutes before you take it from the fire; stir in three large
tablespoonfuls of browned flour rubbed smooth in three great spoonfuls
of melted butter, let it boil up well, and finish the seasoning by the
addition of a glass and a half of good wine—Sherry or Madeira—and
the juice of a lemon. It should not boil more than half an hour on the
second day. Serve with sliced lemon. Some lay the slices upon the top
of the soup, but the better plan is to pass to the guests a small dish
containing these.

If the directions be closely followed, the result is sure to be
satisfactory, and the task is really much less troublesome than it
appears to be.


GIBLET SOUP.

    Feet, neck, pinions, and giblets of three chickens, or of two
        ducks or two geese.
    1½ lb. veal.
    ½ lb. ham.
    3 qts. water.

Crack the bones into small pieces, and cut the meat into strips. Put
all together with the giblets over the fire, with a bunch of sweet
herbs and a pinch of allspice. Stew slowly for two hours. Take out the
giblets and set them aside in a pan where they will keep warm. Take up
a teacupful of the hot soup and stir into this a large tablespoonful of
flour which has been wet with cold water and rubbed to a smooth paste;
then, two tablespoonfuls of butter. Return to the pot and boil for
fifteen minutes; season at the last with a glass of brown sherry and a
tablespoonful of tomato or walnut catsup. A little Worcestershire sauce
is an improvement. Finally, chop and add the giblets, and boil up once.


BROWN GRAVY SOUP.

    3 lbs. beef.
    1 carrot.
    1 turnip.
    1 head of celery.
    6 onions, if small button onions—one, if large.
    3½ qts. water.

Have ready some nice dripping in a frying-pan. Slice the onions and
fry them brown. Take them out and set them by in a covered pan to keep
warm. Cut the beef into bits an inch long and half an inch thick, and
fry them brown also, turning frequently lest they should burn. Chop the
vegetables and put them with the meat and onions into a covered pot.
Pour on the water and let all stew together for two hours. Then throw
in salt and pepper and boil one hour longer, skimming very carefully.
Strain; put back over the fire; boil up once more to make the liquid
perfectly clear, skim, and add a handful of vermicelli that has been
boiled separately and drained dry. The safest plan is to put in the
vermicelli after the soup is poured into the tureen. Do not stir
before it goes to table. The contents of the tureen should be clear
as amber. Some add half a glass of pale Sherry. This is a fine show
soup, and very popular.


VEAL AND SAGO SOUP.

    2½ lbs. veal chopped fine.
    ¼ lb. pearl sago.
    1 pt. milk.
    4 eggs.
    3 qts. water.

Put on the veal and water, and boil slowly until the liquid is reduced
to about one-half the original quantity. Strain out the shreds of meat,
and put the soup again over the fire. Meanwhile the sago should be
washed in several waters, and soaked half an hour in warm water enough
to cover it. Stir it into the strained broth and boil—stirring very
often to prevent lumping or scorching—half an hour more. Heat the milk
almost to boiling; beat the yolks of the eggs very light; mix with the
milk gradually, as in making boiled custard, and pour—stirring all
the while—into the soup. Season with pepper and salt; boil up once to
cook the eggs, and serve. Should the liquid be too thick after putting
in the eggs, replenish with boiling water. It should be about the
consistency of hot custard.

This soup is very good, if chicken broth be substituted for the veal.
It is very strengthening to invalids, and especially beneficial to
those suffering from colds and pulmonary affections.


CHICKEN SOUP. 

    2 young fowls, or one full-grown.
    ½ lb. corned ham.
    1 gallon of water.

Cut the fowls into pieces as for fricassee. Put these with the ham into
the pot with a quart of water, or enough to cover them fairly. Stew for
an hour, if the fowls are tender; if tough, until you can cut easily
into the breast. Take out the breasts, leaving the rest of the meat
in the pot, and add the remainder of the water—boiling hot. Keep the
soup stewing slowly while you chop up the white meat you have selected.
Rub the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs smooth in a mortar or bowl,
moistening to a paste with a few spoonfuls of the soup. Mix with these
a handful of fine bread-crumbs and the chopped meat, and make it into
small balls. When the soup has boiled in all, two hours and a half, if
the chicken be reduced to shreds, strain out the meat and bones. Season
with salt and white pepper, with a bunch of chopped parsley. Drop in
the prepared force-meat, and after boiling ten minutes to incorporate
the ingredients well, add, a little at a time, a pint of rich milk
thickened with flour. Boil up once and serve.

A chicken at least a year old would make better soup than a younger
fowl.


VENISON SOUP. 

    3 lbs. of venison. What are considered the inferior pieces will do.
    1 lb. corned ham or salt pork.
    1 onion.
    1 head of celery.

Cut up the meat; chop the vegetables, and put on with just enough water
to cover them, keeping on the lid of the pot all the while, and stew
slowly for one hour. Then add two quarts of boiling water, with a few
blades of mace and a dozen whole peppers. Or, should you prefer, a
little cayenne. Boil two hours longer, salt, and strain. Return the
liquor to the pot; stir in a tablespoonful of butter, thicken with a
tablespoonful of browned flour wet into a smooth thin paste with cold
water; add a tablespoonful of walnut or mushroom catsup, a teaspoonful
of Worcestershire or other pungent sauce, and a generous glass of
Madeira or brown Sherry.


HARE OR RABBIT SOUP.

Dissect the rabbit, crack the bones, and prepare precisely as you would
the venison soup, only putting in three small onions instead of one,
and a bunch of sweet herbs. Hares which are too tough to be cooked in
any other way, make excellent game soup. Also, the large gray squirrel
of the Middle and Southern States.


OX-TAIL SOUP.

    1 ox-tail.
    2 lbs. lean beef.
    4 carrots.
    3 onions.
    Thyme.

Cut the tail into several pieces and fry brown in butter. Slice the
onions and two carrots, and when you remove the ox-tail from the
frying-pan, put in these and brown them also. When done, tie them in a
bag with a bunch of thyme and drop into the soup-pot. Lay the pieces of
ox-tail in the same; then the meat cut into small slices. Grate over
them the two whole carrots, and add four quarts of cold water, with
pepper and salt. Boil from four to six hours, in proportion to the size
of the tail. Strain fifteen minutes before serving it, and thicken with
two tablespoonfuls of browned flour. Boil ten minutes longer.


FISH SOUPS.


OYSTER SOUP (No. 1). 

    2 qts. of oysters.
    1 qt. of milk.
    2 tablespoonfuls butter.
    1 teacupful water.

Strain the liquor from the oysters, add to it the water, and set it
over the fire to heat slowly in a covered vessel. When it is near
boiling, season with pepper and salt; add the oysters, and let them
stew until they “ruffle” on the edge. This will be in about five
minutes. Then put in the butter with the milk which has been heated in
a separate vessel, and stir well for two minutes.

Serve with sliced lemon and oyster or cream crackers. Some use mace
and nutmeg in seasoning. The crowning excellence in oyster soup is to
have it cooked just enough. Too much stewing ruins the bivalves, while
an underdone oyster is a flabby abomination. The plumpness of the main
body and ruffled edge are good indices of their right condition.


OYSTER SOUP (No. 2).

    2 qts. of oysters.
    2 eggs.
    1 qt. of milk.
    1 teacupful of water.

Strain the liquor from the oysters into a saucepan, pour in with it
the water. Season with cayenne pepper and a little salt, a teaspoonful
of mingled nutmeg, mace, and cloves. When the liquor is almost
boiling, add half the oysters chopped finely and boil five minutes
quite briskly. Strain the soup and return to saucepan. Have ready some
force-meat balls, not larger than marbles, made of the yolks of the
eggs boiled hard and rubbed to a smooth paste with a little butter,
then mix with six raw oysters chopped very finely, a little salt, and
a raw egg well beaten, to bind the ingredients together. Flour your
hands well and roll the force-meat into pellets, laying them upon a
cold plate, so as not to touch one another until needed. Then put the
reserved whole oysters into the hot soup, and when it begins to boil
again, drop in the force-meat marbles. Boil until the oysters “ruffle,”
by which time the balls will also be done. Add the hot milk.

Serve with sliced lemon and crackers. A liberal tablespoonful of butter
stirred in gently at the last is an improvement.


CLAM SOUP.

    50 clams.
    1 qt. milk.
    1 pint water.
    2 tablespoonfuls butter.

Drain off the liquor from the clams and put it over the fire with a
dozen whole peppers, a few bits of cayenne pods, half a dozen blades
of mace, and salt to taste. Let it boil for ten minutes, then put in
the clams and boil half an hour quite fast, keeping the pot closely
covered. If you dislike to see the whole spices in the tureen, strain
them out before the clams are added. At the end of the half hour add
the milk, which has been heated to scalding, not boiling, in another
vessel. Boil up again, taking care the soup does not burn, and put in
the butter. Then serve without delay. If you desire a thicker soup stir
a heaping tablespoonful of rice-flour into a little cold milk, and put
in with the quart of hot.


CAT-FISH SOUP. 

Those who have only seen the bloated, unsightly “hornpouts” that play
the scavengers about city wharves, are excusable for entertaining a
prejudice against them as an article of food. But the small cat-fish
of our inland lakes and streams are altogether respectable, except in
their unfortunate name.

    6 cat-fish, in average weight half a pound apiece.
    ½ lb. salt pork.
    1 pint milk.
    2 eggs.
    1 head of celery, or a small bag of celery seed.

Skin and clean the fish and cut them up. Chop the pork into small
pieces. Put these together into the pot, with two quarts of water,
chopped sweet herbs, and the celery seasoning. Boil for an hour, or
until fish and pork are in rags, and strain, if you desire a regular
soup for a first course. Return to the saucepan and add the milk, which
should be already hot. Next the eggs, beaten to a froth, and a lump
of butter the size of a walnut. Boil up once, and serve with dice of
toasted bread on the top. Pass sliced lemon, or walnut or butternut
pickles with it.


EEL SOUP.

Eel soup is made in precisely the same manner as cat-fish, only boiled
longer. A chopped onion is no detriment to the flavor of either, and
will remove the muddy taste which these fish sometimes acquire from
turbid streams.


LOBSTER SOUP.

    2 qts. veal or chicken broth, well strained.
    1 large lobster.
    2 eggs—boiled hard.

Boil the lobster and extract the meat, setting aside the coral in a
cool place. Cut or chop up the meat found in the claws. Rub the yolks
of the eggs to a paste with a teaspoonful of butter. Pound and rub the
claw-meat in the same manner, and mix with the yolks. Beat up a raw
egg, and stir into the paste; season with pepper, salt, and, if you
like, mace; make into force-meat balls, and set away with the coral to
cool and harden. By this time the stock should be well heated, when,
put in the rest of the lobster-meat cut into square bits. Boil fifteen
minutes, which time employ in pounding the coral in a Wedgewood mortar,
or earthenware bowl, rubbing it into a fine, even paste, with the
addition of a few spoonfuls of the broth, gradually worked in until it
is about the consistency of boiled starch. Stir very carefully into
the hot soup, which should, in the process, blush into a roseate hue.
Lastly, drop in the force-meat balls, after which do not stir, lest
they should break. Simmer a few minutes to cook the raw egg; but, if
allowed to boil, the soup will darken.

Crab soup may be made in the same way, excepting the coralline process,
crabs being destitute of that dainty.


GREEN TURTLE SOUP.

    A glass of Madeira.
    2 onions.
    Bunch of sweet herbs.
    Juice of one lemon.
    5 qts of water.

Chop up the coarser parts of the turtle-meat, with the entrails and
bones. Add to them four quarts of water, and stew four hours with the
herbs, onions, pepper, and salt. Stew very slowly, but do not let it
cease to boil during this time. At the end of four hours strain the
