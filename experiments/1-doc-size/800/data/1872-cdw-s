and miles in the most enchanting scenery. Art has not 
been allowed here to spoil nature. The trees, which 
are of magnificent size, are left to grow naturally ; the 
Isar, which is turned into it, flows in more than one 
stream with its mountain impetuosity ; the lake is grace- 
fully indented and overhung with trees, and presents 
ever-changing aspects of loveliness as you walk along its 





banks ; there are open, sunny meadows, in whicli single 
giant trees or splendid groups of them stand, and walks 
without end winding under leafy Gothic arches. You 
know already that Munich owes this fine park to the 
foresight and liberality of an American Tory, Benjamin 
Thompson (Count Rumford), born in E,umford, Vt., who 
also relieved Munich of beo-gars. 

I have spoken of the number of soldiers in Munich. 
For six weeks the Landwehr, or militia, has been in 
camp in various parts of Bavaria. There was a grand 
review of them the other day on the Field of Mars, by 
the king, and many of them have now gone home. They 
strike an unmilitary man as a very efficient body of troops. 
So far as I could see, they were armed with breech-load- 
ing rifles. There is a treaty by which Bavaria agreed 
to assimilate her military organization to that of Prussia. 
It is thus that Bismarck is continually getting ready. 
But if the Landwehr is gone, there are yet remaining 
troops enough of the line. Their chief use, so far as it 
concerns me, is to make pageants in the streets, and to 
send their bands to play at noon in the public squares. 
Every day, when the sun shines down upon the mounted 
statue of Ludwig I., in front of the Odeon, a band plays 
in an open Loggia, and there is always a crowd of idlers 
in the square to hear it. Everybody has leisure for that 
sort of thing here in Europe ; and one can easily learn 
how to be idle and let the world wag. They have found 
out here what is disbelieved in America, â€” that the world 
will continue to turn over once in about twenty-four 
hours (they are not accurate as to the time) without 
their aid. To return to our soldiers. The cavalry most 
impresses me ; the men are so finely mounted, and they 
ride royally. In these sparkling mornings, when the 
regiments clatter past, with swelling music and shining 
armor, riding away to I know not what adventure and 
glory, I confess that I long to follow them. I have long had 
this desire ; and the other morning, determining to satisfy 
it, I seized my hat and went after the prancing proces- 




sion. I am sorry I did. For, after trudging after it 
through street after street, the fine horsemen all rode 
through an arched gateway, and disappeared in barracks, 
to my great disgust ; and the troopers dismounted, and 
led their steeds into stables. 

And yet one never loses a walk here in Munich. I 
found myself that morning by the Isar Thor, a restored 
mediaeval city-gate. The gate is double, with flanking 
octagonal towers, enclosing a quadrangle. Upon the 
inner wall is a fresco of '' The Crucifixion." Over the 
outer front is a representation, in fresco painting, of the 
triumphal entry into the city of the Emperor Louis of 
Bavaria after the battle of Ampfing. On one side of the 
gate is a portrait of the Virgin, on gold ground, and on 
the other a very passable one of the late Dr. Hawes of 
Hartford, with a Pope's hat on. Walking on, I came to 
another arched gateway and clock-tower ; near it an old 
church, with a high wall adjoining, whereon is a fresco 
of cattle led to slaughter, showing that I am in the vicin- 
ity of the Victual Market; and I enter it through a 
narrow, crooked alley. There is nothing there but an 
assemblage of shabby booths and fruit-stands, and au 
ancient stone tower in ruins and overgrown with ivy. 

Leaving this, I came out to the Marian Platz, where 
stands the column, with the statue of the Virgin and 
Child, set up by Maximilian I. in 1638 to celebrate the 
victory in the battle which established the Catholic 
supremacy in Bavaria. It is a favorite praying-place 
for the lower classes. Yesterday was a fete day, and 
the base of the column and half its height are lost in a 
mass of flowers and evergreens. Li front is erected an 
altar with a broad, carpeted platform ; and a strip of the 
platz before it is enclosed with a railing, within which 
are praying-benches. The sun shines down hot ; but 
there are several poor women kneeling there, with their 
baskets beside them. I happen along there at sundown ; 
and there are a score of women kneeling on the hard 
stoneSj outside the railing saying their prayers in loud 


voices. The mass of flowers is still sweet and gay and 
fresh ; a fountain with fantastic figures is flashing near 
by ; the crowd, going home to supper and beer, gives no 
heed to the praying; the stolid drosche-drivers stand 
listlessly by. At the head of the square is an artillery 
station, and a row of cannon frowns on it. On one side 
is a house with a tablet in the wall, recording the fact 
that Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden once lived in it. 

When we came to Munich, the great annual fair was 
in progress ; and the large Maximilian Platz (not to be 
confounded with the street of that name) was filled with 
booths of cheap merchandise, puppet-shows, lottery 
shanties, and all sorts of popular amusements. It was 
a fine time to study peasant costumes. The city was 
crowded with them on Sunday; and let us not forget 
that the first visit of the peasants was to the churches : 
they invariably attended early mass before they set out 
upon the day's pleasure. Most of the churches have 
services at all hours till noon, some of them with fine 
classical and military music. One could not but be 
struck with the devotional manner of the simple women, 
in their queer costumes, who walked into the gaudy edi- 
fices, were absorbed in their prayers for an hour, and 
then went away. I suppose they did not know how odd 
they looked in their high, round fur hats, or their fan- 
tastic old ornaments, nor that there was any thing amiss 
in bringing their big baskets into church with them. 
At least, their simple, unconscious manner was better 
than that of many of the city people, some of whom 
stare about a good deal, while going through the service, 
and stop in the midst of crossings and genuflections to 
take snuff" and pass it to their neighbors. But there are 
always present simple and homelike sort of people, who 
neither follow the fashions nor look round on them ; 
respectable, neat old ladies, in the faded and carefully- 
preserved silk gowns, such as the New-England women 
wear to " meeting." 

No one can help admiring the simplicity, kindliness, 





and honesty of the Germans. The universal courtesy 
and friendliness of manner have a very different seeming 
from the politeness of the French. At the hotels in the 
country, the landlord and his wife and the servant join 
in hoping you will sleep well when you go to bed. The 
little maid at Heidelberg who served our meals always 
went to the extent of wishing us a good appetite when 
she had brought in the dinner. Here in Munich the 
people we have occasion to address in the street are uni- 
formly courteous. The shop-keepers are obliging, and 
rarely servile, like the English. You are thanked, and 
punctiliously wished the good day, whether you purchase 
any thing or not. In shops tended by women, gentlemen 
invariably remove their hats. If you buy only a kreu- 
zer's worth of fruit of an old woman, she says words that 
would be, literally translated, " I thank you beautifully.'* 
With all this, one looks kindly on the childish love the 
Germans have for titles. It is, I believe, difficult for the 
German mind to comprehend that we can be in good 
standing at home, unless we have some title prefixed to 
our names, or some descriptive phrase added. Our good 
landlord, who waits at the table and answers our bell, 
one of whose tenants is a living baron, having no title 
to put on his door-plate under that of the baron, must 
needs dub himself " privatier ; " and he insists upon 
prefixing the name of this unambitious writer with the 
ennobling von; and at the least he insists, in common 
with the tradespeople, that I am a "Herr Doctor." 
The bills of purchases by madame come made out to 

"Frau , well-born." At a hotel in Heidelberg, 

where I had registered my name with that distinctness 
of penmanship for which newspaper men are justly con- 
spicuous, and had added to my own name " & wife," I 
was not a little flattered to appear in the reckoning aa 
" Herr Doctor Mamesweise." 



THE GOTTESACKER AND BAVARIAN 
FUNERALS. 

TO change the subject from gay to grave. The 
Gottesacker of Munich is called the finest cemetery 
in Germany ; at least, it surpasses them in the artistic 
taste of its monuments. Natural beauty it has none : it is 
simply a long, narrow strip of ground enclosed in walls, 
with straight, parallel walks running the whole length, 
and narrow cross-walks; and yet it is a lovely burial- 
ground. There are but few trees ; but the whole enclosure 
is a conservatory of beautiful flowers. Every grave is cov- 
ered with them, every monument is surrounded with 
them. The monuments are unpretending in size, but 
there are many fine designs, and many finely-executed 
busts and statues and allegorical figures, in both marble 
and bronze. The place is full of sunlight and color. I 
noticed that it was much frequented. In front of every 
place of sepulchre stands a small urn for water, with a 
brush hanging by, with which to sprinkle the flowers. I 
saw, also, many women and children coming and going 
with watering-pots, so that the flowers never droop for 
want of care. At the lower end of the old ground is an 
open arcade, wherein are some effigies and busts, and 
many ancient tablets set into the wall. Beyond this is 
the new cemetery, an enclosure surrounded by a high 
wall of. brick, and on the inside by an arcade. The 
space within is planted with flowers, and laid out for the 
burial of the people; the arcades are devoted to the 
occupation of those who can afford costly tombs. Only 


a small number of them are yet occupied ; there are some 
good busts and monuments, and some frescos on the 
panels rather more striking for size and color than for 
beauty. 

Between the two cemeteries is the house for the dead. 
When I walked down the long central allee of the old 
ground, I saw at the farther end, beyond a fountain, 
twinkling lights. Coming nearer, I found that they pro- 
ceeded from the large windows of a building, which was 
a part of the arcade. People were looking in at the win- 
dows, going and coming to and from them continually ; 
and I was prompted by otiriosity to look within. A most 
unexpected sight met my eye. In a long room, upon ele- 
vated biers, lay people dead: they were so disposed 
that the faces could be seen ; and there they rested in a 
solemn repose. Officers in uniform, citizens in plain 
dress, matrons and maids in the habits that they wore 
when living, or in the white robes of the grave. About 
most of them were lighted candles. About all of them 
were flowers : some were almost covered with bouquets. 
There were rows of children, â€” little ones scarce a span 
long, â€” in the white caps and garments of innocence, as 
if asleep in beds of bowers. How naturally they all were 
lying, as if only waiting to be called ! Upon the thumb 
of every adult was a ring in which a string was tied that 
went through a pulley above and communicated with a 
bell in the attendant's room. How frightened he would 
be if the bell should ever sound, and he should go into 
that hall of the dead to see who rang ! And yet it is a 
most wise and humane provision ; and many years ago, 
there is a tradition, an entombment alive was prevented 
by it. There are three rooms in all ; and all those who 
die in Munich must be brought and laid in one of them, 
to be seen of all who care to look therein. I suppose 
that wealth and rank have some privileges ; but it is the 
law that a person having been pronounced dead by the 

Ehysician shall be the same day brought to the dead- 
ouse, and lie there three whole days before interment. 





There is something peculiar in the obsequies of Mu- 
nich, especially in the Catholic portion of the population. 
Shortly after the death, there is a short service in the 
courtyard of the house, which, with the entrance, is liung 
in costly mourning, if the deceased was rich. The body 
is then carried in the car to the dead-house, attended by 
the priests, the male members of the family, and a pro- 
cession of torch-bearers, if that can be afforded. Tliree 
days after, the bui-ial takes place from the dead-house, 
only males attending. The women never go to the fune- 
ral ; but some days after, of which public notice is given 
by advertisement, a public service is held in church, at 
which all the family are present, and to which the friends 
are publicly invited. Funeral obsequies are as costly 
here as in America ; but every thing is here regulated 
and fixed by custom. There are as many as five or six 
classes of funerals recognized. Those of the first class, 
as to rank and expense, cost about a thousand guldens. 
The second class is divided into six sub-classes. The 
third is divided into two. The cost of the first of the 
third class is about four hundred guldens. The low- 
est class of those able to have a funeral costs twenty-five 
guldens. A gulden is about two francs. There are no 
carriages used at the funerals of Catholics, only at those 
of Protestants and Jews. 

I spoke of the custom of advertising the deaths. A 
considerable portion of the daily newspapers is devoted 
to these announcements, which are printed in display 
type, like the advertisements of dry-goods sellers with 
you. I will roughly translate one which I happen to see 
just now. It reads, " Death advertisement. It has 
pleased God the Almighty, in his inscrutable providence, 
to take away our innermost loved, best husband, father, 

grandfather, uncle, brother-in-law, and cousin, Herr 

, dyer of cloth and silk, yesterday night, at eleven 

o'clock, after three weeks of severe suffering, having par- 
taken of the holy sacrament, in his sixty-sixth year, out 
of this earthly abode of calamity into the better Beyond, 





Those who knew his good heart, his great honesty, as 
well as his patience in suffering, will know how justly to 
estimate our grief." This is signed by the " deep-griev- 
ing survivors," â€” the widow, son, daughter, and daughter- 
in-law, in the name of the absent relatives. After the 
name of the son is written, " Dyer in cloth and silk." 
The notice closes with an announcement of the funeral 
at the cemetery, and a service at the church the day 
after. The advertisement I have given is not uncommon 
either for quaintness or simplicity. It is common to 
engrave upon the monument the business as well as the 
title of the departed. 



THE OCTOBER FEST. â€”THE PEASANTS 
AND THE KING. 

ON the 11th of October the sun came out, after a 
retirement of nearly two weeks. The cause of the 
appearance was the close of the October Fest. This 
great popular carnival has the same effect upon the 
weather in Bavaria that the Yearly Meeting of Friends 
is known to produce in Philadelphia, and the Great Na- 
tional Horse Fair in New England. It always rains 
during; the October Fest. Havinsj found this out, I do 
not know why they do not change the time of it ; but I ' 
presume they are wise enough to feel that it would be 
useless. A similar attempt on the part of the Pennsyl- 
vania Quakers merely disturbed the operations of nature, 
but did not save the drab bonnets from the annual wet- 
ting. There is a subtle connection between such gather- 
ings and the gathering of what are called the elements, 
â€” a sympathetic connection, which we shall, no doubt, 
one day understand, when we have collected facts enough 
on the subject to make a comprehensive generalization, 
after Mr. Buckle's method. 

This fair, which is just concluded, is a true Folks- 
Fest, a season especially for the Bavarian people, an 
agricultural fair and cattle show, but a time of gene- 
ral jollity and amusement as well. Indeed, the main 
object of a German fair seems to be to have a good time ; 
and in this it is in marked contrast with American fairs. 
The October Fest was instituted for the people by the 
old Ludwig I. on the occasion of his marriage ; and it 


has ever since retained its position as the great festival 
of the Bavarian people, and particularly of the peasants. 
It offers a rare opportunity to the stranger to study the 
costumes of th-e peasants, and to see how they amuse 
themselves. One can judge a good deal of the progress 
of a people by the sort of amusements that satisfy them. 
I am not about to draw any philosophical interferences, â€” 
I am a mere looker-on in Munich ; but I have never 
anywhere else seen puppet-shows afford so much delight, 
nor have I ever seen anybody get more satisfaction out 
of a sausage and a mug of beer, with the tum-tum of a 
band near by, than a Bavarian peasant. 

The Fest was held on the Theresien Wiese, a vast 
meadow on the outskirts of the city. The ground rises 
on one side of this by an abrupt step, some thirty or 
forty feet high, like the "bench" of a Western river. 
This bank is terraced for seats the whole length, or as 
far down as the statue of Bavaria ; so that there are turf 
seats, I should judge, for three-quarters of a mile, for a 
great many thousands of people, who can look down 
upon the race-course, the tents, houses, and booths of the 
fair ground, and upon the roof and spires of the city 
beyond. The statue is, as you know, the famous bronze 
Bavaria of Schwanthaler, a colossal female figure, fifty 
feet high, and, with its pedestal, a hundred feet high, 
which stands in front of the Hall of Fame, a Doric edi- 
fice, in the open colonnades of which are displayed the 
busts of the most celebrated Bavarians, together with 
those of a few poets and scholars who were so unfortu- 
nate as not to be born here. The Bavaria stands with 
the right hand upon the sheathed sword, and the left 
raised in the act of bestowing a wreath of victory ; and 
the Ron of the kingdom is beside her. This representa- 
tive being is, of course, hollow. There is room for eight 
people in her head, which I can testify is a warm place 
on a sunny day ; and one can peep out through loop- 
holes and get a good view of the Alps of the Tyrol. To 
say that this statue is graceful or altogether successful, 
 

would be an error ; but it is rather impressive, from its 
size, if for- no other reason. In the cast of the hand 
exhibited at the bronze foundery, the forefinger meas- 
ures over three feet long. 

Akhough the Fest did not officially begin until Fri- 
day, Oct. 2, yet the essential part of it, the amusements, 
"was well under way on the Sunday before. The town 
began to be filled with country people, and the holiday 
might be said to have commenced ; for the city gives 
itself up to the occasion. The new art galleries are 
closed for some days ; but the collections and museums 
of various sorts are daily open, gratis ; the theatres 
redouble their efforts ; the concert-halls are in full blast ; 
there are dances nightly, and masked balls in the Folks' 
Theatre ; country relatives are entertained ; the peasants 
go about the streets in droves, in a simple and happy 
frame of mind, wholly unconscious that they are the 
oddest-looking guys that have come down from the Mid- 
dle Ages ; there is music in all the gardens, singing in 
the cq/es, beer flowing in rivers, and a mighty smell of . 
cheese, that goes up to heaven. If the eating of cheese 
were a religious act, and its odor an incense, I could not 
say enough of the devoutness of the Bavarians. 

Of the picturesqueness and oddity of the Bavarian 
peasants' costumes, nothing but a picture can give you 
any idea. You can imagine the men in tight breeches, 
buttoned below the knee, jackets of the jockey cut, and 
both jacket and waistcoat covered with big metal but- 
tons, sometimes coins, as thickly as can be sewed on : 
hut the women defy the pen; a Bavarian peasant-woman, 
in holiday dress, is the most fearfully and wonderfully 
made object in the universe. She displays a good length 
of striped stockings, and wears thin slippers, or sandals ; 
her skirts are like a hogshead, in size and shape, and 
reach so near her shoulders as to make her appear hump- 
backed ; the sleeves are hugely swelled out at the shoul- 
der, and taper to the wrist ; the bodice is a stifi" and most 
elaborately-ornamented piece of armor ; and there is a 





kind of breastplate, or centre-piece, of gold, silver, and 
precious stones, or what passes for them ; and the head 
is adorned with some monstrous heirloom, of finely- 
worked gold or silver, or a tower, gilded and shining 
with long streamers, or bound in a simple black turban, 
with flowing ends. Little old girls, dressed like their 
mothers, have the air of creations of the fancy, who have 
walked out of a fairy-book. There is an endless variety 
in these old costumes ; and one sees, every moment, one 
more preposterous than the preceding. The girls from 
the Tyrol, with their bright neckerchiefs and pointed 
black felt hats, with gold cord and tassels, are some of 
them very pretty : but one looks a long time for a bright 
face among the other class ; and, when it is discovered, 
the owner appears like a maiden who was enchanted a 
hundred years ago, and has not been released irom the 
spell, but is still doomed to wear the garments and the 
ornaments that should long ago have mouldered away 
with her ancestors. 

The Theresien Wiese was a city of Vanity Fair for 
two weeks, every day crowded with a motley throng. 
Booths, and even structures of some solidity, rose on it 
as if by magic. The lottery-houses were set up early, 
and, to the last, attracted crowds, who could not resist 
the tempting display of goods and trinkets, which might 
be won by investing six kreuzers in a bit of paper, which 
might, when unrolled, contain a number. These lotter- 
ies are all authorized : some of them were for the bene- 
fit of the agricultural society ; some were for the poor, 
and others on individual account : and they always 
thrive ; for the German, above all others, loves to try his 
luck. There were streets of shanties, where various 
things were offered for sale besides cheese and sausages. 
There was a long line of booths, where images could be 
shot at with bird-guns ; and, when the shots were success- 
ful, the images went through astonishing revolutions. 
There was a circus, in front of which some of the span- 
gled performers always stood beating drums and postur- 





ing, in order to entice in spectators. Tliere were the 
pnppet-booths, before which all day stood gaping, de- 
lighted crowds, who roared with laughter whenever the 
little frau beat her loutish husband about the head, and 
set him to tend the baby, who continued to wail, not- 
withstanding the man knocked its head against the door- 
post. There were the great beer-restaurants, with tem- 
porary benches and tables, planted about with evergreens, 
always thronged witji a noisy, jolly crowd. There were 
the fires, over which fresh fish were broiling on sticks ; 
and, if you lingered, you saw the fish taken alive from 
tubs of water standing by, dressed and e pitted and broil- 
ing before the wiggle was out of their tails. There were 
the old women who mixed the flour and fried the brown 
cakes before your eyes, or cooked the fragrant sausage, 
and offered it piping hot. 

And every restaurant and show had its band, brass or 
string, â€” a full array of red-faced fellows tooting through 
horns, or a sorry quartet, â€” the fat woman with the 
harp, the lean man blowing himself out through the clari- 
net, the long-haired fellow with the flute, and the robust 
and thick-necked fiddler. Everywhere there was music ; 
the air was full of the odor of cheese and cooking sau- 
sage ; so that there was nothing wanting to the most com- 
plete enjoyment. The crowd surged round, jammed to- 
gether, in the best possible humor. Those who could 
not sit at tables sat on the ground, with a link of an 
eatable I have already named in one hand, and a mug 
of beer beside them. Toward evening, the ground was 
strewn with these gray quart mugs, which gave as per- 
fect evidence of the battle of the day as the cannon-balls 
on the sand before Fort Fisher did of the contest there. 
Besides this, for the amusement of the crowd, there is, 
every day, a wheelbarrow race, a sack race, a blindfold 
contest, or something of the sort, which turns out to be 
a very flat performance. But, all the time, the eatino; and 
the drinking go on, and the clatter and clink of it fill the 
air ; so that the great object of the fair is not lost sight of. 





Meantime, where is the agricultural fair and cattle- 
show ? You must know that we do these things differ- 
ently in Bavaria. On the fair-ground, there is very lit- 
tle to be seen of the fair. There is an enclosure where 
steam-engines are smoking and puffing, and threshing- 
machines are making a clamor ; where some big church- 
bells hang, and where there are a few stalls for horses 
and cattle. But the competing horses and cattle are 
led before the judges elsewhere ; the horses, for instance, 
by the royal stables in the city. I saw no such general 
exhibition of domestic animals as you have at your fairs. 
The horses that took the prizes were of native stock, a 
very serviceable breed, excellent for carriage-horses, and 
admirable in the cavalry service. The bulls and cows 
seemed also native and to the manor born, and were 
worthy of little remark. The mechanical, vegetable, 
and fruit exhibition was in the great glass palace, in the 
city, and was very creditable in the fruit department, â€” in 
the show of grapes and pears especially. The products 
of the dairy were less, though I saw one that I do not 
recollect ever to have seen in America, â€” a landscape in 
butter. Enclosed in a case, it looked very much like a 
wood-carving. There was a Swiss cottage, a milkmaid, 
with cows in the foreground ; there were trees, and in 
the rear rose rocky precipices, with chamois in the act 
of skipping thereon. I should think something might be 
done in our country in this line of the fine arts ; cer- 
tainly, some of the butter that is always being sold so 
cheap at St. Albans, when it is high everywhere else, 
must be strong enough to warrant the attempt. As to 
the other departments of the fine arts in the glass palace, 
I cannot give you a better idea of them than by saying 
that they were as well filled as the like ones in the 
American county fairs. There were machines for 
threshing, for straw-cutting, for apple-paring, and gene- 
rally such a display of implements as would give one a 
favorable idea of Bavarian agriculture. There was an 
interesting exhibition of live fish, great and small, of 

nearly every sort, I should think, in Bavarian waters. 
The show in the fire-department was so antiquated, that 
I was convinced that the people of Munich never intend 
to have any fires. 

The great day of the fete was Sunday, Oct. 5 ; for on 
that day the king went out to the fair-ground, and dis- 
tributed the prizes to the owners of the best horses, and, 
as they appeared to me, of the most ugly-colored bulls. 
The city was literally crowded with peasants and coun- 
try people ; the churches were full all the morning with 
devout -masses, which poured into the waiting beer- 
houses afterward with equal zeal. By twelve o'clock, 
the city began to empty itself upon the Theresien 
meadow ; and long before the time for the king to arrive 
â€” two o'clock â€” there were acres of people waiting for 
the performance to begin. The terraced bank, of which 
I have spoken, was taken possession of early, and held 
by a solid mass of people ; while the fair-ground proper 
was packed with a swaying concourse, densest near the 
royal pavilion, which was erected immediately on the 
race-course, and opposite the bank. 

At one o'clock the grand stand opposite to the royal 
one is taken possession of by a regiment band and by 
invited guests. All the space, except the race-course, 
is, by this time, packed with people, who watch the red 
and white gate at the head of the course with growing 
impatience. It opens to let in a regiment of infantry, 
which marches in and takes position. It swings, every 
now and then, for a solitary horseman, who gallops down 
the line in all the pride of mounted civic dignity, to the 
disgust of the crowd ; or to let in a carriage, with some 
over-dressed officer or splendid minister, who is entitled 
to a place in the royal pavilion. It is a people's fete 
and the civic officers enjoy one day of conspicuous 
glory. Now a majestic person in gold lace is set down; 
and now one in a scarlet coat, as beautiful as a flamingo. 
These driblets of splendor only feed the popular impa- 
tience. Music is heard in the distance, and a procession 







with colored banners is seen approaclimg from the city. 
That, like every thing else that is to come, stops beyond 
the c osed gate; and there it halts, ready to stream down 
before our lyes in a variegated pageant. The tmie goes 
on: the crowd gets denser, for there have been steady 
rivers of people pouring into the grounds for m?re than 
an hour. "The military bands pay m the lonn 
the peasants jabber in unmtelligible dialects the high 
functionaries in the royal stand are good enough to move 
around, and let us see how brave and majestic they aie. 
At last the firing of cannon announces the coming ot 
royalty. There is a commotion in the vast crowd yonder, 
the ea-erly-watched gates swing wide, and a well-mounted 
company of cavalry dashes down the turf, m unifor of 
liaht blue and gold. It is a citizen s company of bu ch- 
ers and bakers and candlestick-makers, which would do 
no discredit to the regular army. Driving close alter is 
a four-horse carriagewith two of the king's ministers; 
Ld then, at a rapid pace, six coal-black horses in sier 
harness, with mounted postilions, drawing  long, slen 
der, open carriage with one seat, m which ride the km- 
and his brotherr Prince Otto, come down the way, and 
are pulenp in front of the pavilion; while the cannon 
oarrlhe b S bells ring, all the flags of Bavaria, Prussia 
and Aus?riaron innum;rable polel, are blowing straight 
out tte band plays " God save the King," tl-P-P break 
into enthusiastic shouting, and the young king, thiowmg 
off his cloak, rises and stands m his carnage foi a 
moment bowino- right and left before he descends. He 
we"rrto-day the simple uniform of the citi-ns' com 
which has escorted him, and is consequently more plamly 
and neatly dressed than any one else on the Pattorm, â€” a 
Ull (say L feet), slender, gallant-looking young tellow 
of three and twenty, with an open face and a graceful 

manner. , . . ,  â€ž cfonrl  

But, when he has arrived, things again come to a stand , 

and we wait for an hour, and watch the thickening of 

the clouds, while the king goes from this to that delighted 





dignitary on the stand and converses. At the end of 
this time, there is a movement. A white dog has got 
into the course, and runs up and down between the 
 walls of people in terror, headed off by soldiers at 
either side of the grand stand, and finally, becoming 
desperate, he makes a dive for the royal pavilion. The 
consternation is extreme. The people cheer the dog and 
laugh : a white-handed official, in gold lace, and without 
his hat, rushes out to " shoo " the dog away, but is unsuc- 
cessful ; for the animal dashes between his legs, and 
approaches the royal and carpeted steps. More men of 
rank run at him, and he is finally captured and borne 
away ; and we all breathe freer that the danger to royalty 
is averted. At one o'clock six youths in white jackets, 
with clubs and coils of rope, had stationed themselves by 
the pavilion, but they did not go into action at this 
juncture ; and I thought they rather enjoyed the activity 
of the great men who kept off the dog. 

At lensth there was another stir : and the king de- 
scended from the rear of his pavilion, attended by his 
ministers, and moved about among the people, who made 
way for him, and uncovered at his approach. He spoke 
with one and another, and strolled about as his fancy 
took him. I suppose this is called mingling with the 
common people. After he had mingled about fifteen 
minutes, he returned, and took his place on the steps in 
front of the pavilion ; and the distribution of prizes 
began. First the horses were led out ; and their owners, 
approaching the king, received from his hands the diplo- 
mas, and a flag from an attendant. Most of them were 
peasants ; and they exhibited no servility in receiving 
their marks of distinction, but bowed to the king as 
they would to any other man, and his majesty touched 
his cocked hat in return. Then came the prize-cattle, 
many of them led by women, who are as interested as 
their husbands in all farm matters. Every thing goes 
off smoothly, except there is a momentary panic over a 
fractious bull, who plunges into the crowd ; but the six 








white jackets are about liim in an instant, and entangle 
liiai with their ropes. 

This over, the gates again open, and the gaj caval- 
cade that has been so long in sight approaches. First 
a band of musicians in costumes of the Middle Ages ; 
and then a band of pages in ih.Q gayest apparel, bearing 
pictured banners and flags of all colors, whose silken 
lustre would have been gorgeous in sunshine ; these 
were followed by mounted heralds with trumpets, and 
after them were led the running horses entered for the 
race. The banners go upon the royal stand, and group 
themselves picturesquely ; the heralds disappear at the 
other end of the list ; and almost immediately the horses, 
ridden by young jockeys in stunning colors, come flying 
past in a general scramble. There are a dozen or more 
horses ; but, after the first round, the race lies between 
two. The course is considerably over an English mile, 
and they make four circuits ; so that the race is fully six 
miles, â€” a very hard one. It was a run in a rain, how- 
ever, which began wheii it did, and soon forced up the 
umbrellas. The vast crowd disappeared under a shed of 
umbrellas, of all colors, â€” black, green, red, blue ; and 
the effect Vas very singular, especially when it moved from 
the field : there was then a Niagara of umbrellas. The 
race was soon over : it is only a peasants' race, after all ; 
the aristocratic races of the best horses take place in 
May. It was over. The king's carriage was brought 
round, the people again shouted, the cannon roared, the 
six black horses reared and plunged, and away he 
went. 

" After all," says the artist, " the King of Bavaria has 
not much power." 

" You can see," returns a gentleman who speaks Eng- 
lish, "just how much he has : it is a six-horse power." 

On other days there was horse-trotting, music produc- 
tion, and for several days prize-shooting. The latter was 
admirably conducted : the targets were placed at the 
foot of the bank ; and opposite, I should think not more 



than two hundred yards off, were shooting-houses, each 
with a room for the register of the shots, and on each side 
of him closets where the shooters stand. Signal-wires run 
from these houses to the targets, where there are attend- 
ants who telegraph the effect of every shot. Each com- 
petitor has a little book ; and he shoots at any booth he 
pleases, or at all, and has his shots registered. There 
was a continual fusillade for a couple of days ; but what 
it all came to, I cannot tell. I can only say, that, if they 
shoot as steadily as they drink beer, there is no other 
corps of shooters that can stand before them. 



INDIAN SUMMER. 

WE are all quiet along the Isar since the October 
Fest ; since the young king has come back from 
his summer castle on the Starnberg See to live in his 
dingy palace ; since the opera has got into good work- 
ing order, and the regular indoor concerts at the cafes have 
begun. There is no lack of amusements, with balls, 
theatres, and the cheap concerts, vocal and instrumental. 
I stepped into the West Ende Halle the other night, 
having first surrendered twelve kreuzers to the money- 
changer at the entrance, â€” double the usual fee, by the 
way. It was large and' well lighted, with a gallery all 
round it and an orchestral platform at one end. The 
floor and gallery were filled with people of the most 
respectable class, who sat about little round tables, and 
drank beer. Every man was smoking a cigar ; and the 
atmosphere was of that degree of haziness that we asso- 
ciate with Indian summer at home ; so that through it 
the people in the gallery appeared like glorified objects 
in a heathen Pantheon, and the orchestra like men play- 
ing in a dream. Yet nobody seemed to mind it ; and 
there was, indeed, a general air of social enjoyment and 
good feeling. Whether this good feeling was in process 
of being produced by the twelve or twenty glasses of 
beer which it is not unusual for a German to drink 
of an evening, I do not know. " I do not drink much 
beer now," said a German acquaintance, â€” " not more 
than four or five glasses in an evening." This is indeed 
moderation, when we remember that sixteen glasses of
