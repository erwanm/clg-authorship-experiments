come back to the fold again. How goes the good work of the Lord?"

"Well, everywhere," said Father Antonio, and then, recollecting his
young friend, he suddenly turned and said,--

"Let me present to you one son who comes to seek your
instructions,--the young Signor Agostino, of the noble house of
Sarelli."

The Superior turned to Agostino with a movement full of a generous
frankness, and warmly extended his hand, at the same time fixing upon
him the mesmeric glance of a pair of large, deep blue eyes, which
might, on slight observation, have been mistaken for black, so great
was their depth and brilliancy.

Agostino surveyed his new acquaintance with that mingling of ingenuous
respect and curiosity with which an ardent young man would regard
the most distinguished leader of his age, and felt drawn to him by a
certain atmosphere of vital cordiality such as one can feel better than
describe.

"You have ridden far to-day, my son,--you must be weary," said the
Superior, affably; "but here you must feel yourself at home; command
us in anything we can do for you. The brothers will attend to those
refreshments which are needed after so long a journey; and when you
have rested and supped, we shall hope to see you a little more quietly."

So saying, he signed to one or two brothers who stood by, and,
commending the travelers to their care, left the apartment.

In a few moments a table was spread with a plain and wholesome repast,
to which the two travelers sat down with appetites sharpened by their
long journey.

During the supper, the brothers of the convent, among whom Father
Antonio had always been a favorite, crowded around him in a state of
eager excitement.

"You should have been here the last week," said one; "such a turmoil as
we have been in!"

"Yes," said another, "the Pope hath set on the Franciscans, who, you
know, are always ready enough to take up with anything against our
order, and they have been pursuing our father like so many hounds."

"There hath been a whirlwind of preaching here and there," said a
third, "in the Duomo, and Santa Croce, and San Lorenzo; and they have
battled to and fro, and all the city is full of it."

"Tell him about yesterday, about the ordeal," shouted an eager voice.

Two or three voices took up the story at once, and began to tell it,
all the others correcting, contradicting, or adding incidents. From
the confused fragments here and there Agostino gathered that there
had been on the day before a popular spectacle in the grand piazza,
in which, according to an old superstition of the Middle Ages, Fra
Girolamo Savonarola and his opponents were expected to prove the truth
of their words by passing unhurt through the fire; that two immense
piles of combustibles had been constructed with a narrow passage
between, and the whole magistracy of the city convened, with a throng
of the populace, eager for the excitement of the spectacle; that the
day had been spent in discussions, and scruples, and preliminaries; and
that, finally, in the afternoon, a violent storm of rain arising had
dispersed the multitude and put a stop to the whole exhibition.

"But the people are not satisfied," said Father Angelo; "and there are
enough mischief-makers among them to throw all the blame on our father."

"Yes," said one, "they say he wanted to burn the Holy Sacrament,
because he was going to take it with him into the fire."

"As if it could burn!" said another voice.

"It would to all human appearance, I suppose," said a third.

"Any way," said a fourth, "there is some mischief brewing; for here is
our friend Prospero Rondinelli just come in, who says, when he came
past the Duomo, he saw people gathering, and heard them threatening us:
there were as many as two hundred, he thought."

"We ought to tell Father Girolamo," exclaimed several voices.

"Oh, he will not be disturbed!" said Father Angelo. Since these
affairs, he hath been in prayer in the chapter-room before the blessed
Angelico's picture of the Cross. When we would talk with him of these
things, he waves us away, and says only, 'I am weary; go and tell
Jesus.'"

"He bade me come to him after supper," said Father Antonio. "I will
talk with him."

"Do so,--that is right," said two or three eager voices as the monk and
Agostino, having finished their repast, arose to be conducted to the
presence of the father.




CHAPTER XXI

THE ATTACK ON SAN MARCO


They found him in a large and dimly lighted apartment, sitting absorbed
in pensive contemplation before a picture of the Crucifixion by Fra
Angelico, which, whatever might be its naïve faults of drawing and
perspective, had an intense earnestness of feeling, and, though faded
and dimmed by the lapse of centuries, still stirs in some faint wise
even the practiced dilettanti of our day.

The face upon the cross, with its majestic patience, seemed to shed a
blessing down on the company of saints of all ages who were grouped by
their representative men at the foot. Saint Dominic, Saint Ambrose,
Saint Augustin, Saint Jerome, Saint Francis, and Saint Benedict were
depicted as standing before the Great Sacrifice in company with
the Twelve Apostles, the two Maries, and the fainting mother of
Jesus,--thus expressing the unity of the Church Universal in that
great victory of sorrow and glory. The painting was enclosed above by
a semicircular bordering composed of medallion heads of the Prophets,
and below was a similar medallion border of the principal saints and
worthies of the Dominican order. In our day such pictures are visited
by tourists with red guide-books in their hands, who survey them in the
intervals of careless conversation; but they were painted by the simple
artist on his knees, weeping and praying as he worked, and the sight
of them was accepted by like simple-hearted Christians as a perpetual
sacrament of the eye, by which they received Christ into their souls.

So absorbed was the father in the contemplation of this picture, that
he did not hear the approaching footsteps of the knight and monk. When
at last they came so near as almost to touch him, he suddenly looked
up, and it became apparent that his eyes were full of tears.

He rose, and, pointing with a mute gesture toward the painting, said,--

"There is more in that than in all Michel Angelo Buonarotti hath done
yet, though he be a God-fearing youth,--more than in all the heathen
marbles in Lorenzo's gardens. But sit down with me here. I have to come
here often, where I can refresh my courage."

The monk and knight seated themselves, the latter with his attention
riveted on the remarkable man before him. The head and face of
Savonarola are familiar to us by many paintings and medallions, which,
however, fail to impart what must have been that effect of his personal
presence which so drew all hearts to him in his day. The knight saw
a man of middle age, of elastic, well-knit figure, and a flexibility
and grace of motion which seemed to make every nerve, even to his
finger-ends, vital with the expression of his soul. The close-shaven
crown and the plain white Dominican robe gave a severe and statuesque
simplicity to the lines of his figure. His head and face, like those
of most of the men of genius whom modern Italy has produced, were so
strongly cast in the antique mould as to leave no doubt of the identity
of modern Italian blood with that of the great men of ancient Italy.
His low, broad forehead, prominent Roman nose, well-cut, yet fully
outlined lips, and strong, finely moulded jaw and chin, all spoke the
old Roman vigor and energy, while the flexible delicacy of all the
muscles of his face and figure gave an inexpressible fascination to
his appearance. Every emotion and changing thought seemed to flutter
and tremble over his countenance as the shadow of leaves over sunny
water. His eye had a wonderful dilating power, and when he was excited
seemed to shower sparks; and his voice possessed a surprising scale of
delicate and melodious inflections, which could take him in a moment
through the whole range of human feeling, whether playful and tender or
denunciatory and terrible. Yet, when in repose among his friends, there
was an almost childlike simplicity and artlessness of manner which drew
the heart by an irresistible attraction. At this moment it was easy to
see by his pale cheek and the furrowed lines of his face that he had
been passing through severe struggles; but his mind seemed stayed on
some invisible centre, in a solemn and mournful calm.

"Come, tell me something of the good works of the Lord in our Italy,
brother," he said, with a smile which was almost playful in its
brightness. "You have been through all the lowly places of the land,
carrying our Lord's bread to the poor, and repairing and beautifying
shrines and altars by the noble gift that is in you."

"Yes, father," said the monk; "and I have found that there are many
sheep of the Lord that feed quietly among the mountains of Italy, and
love nothing so much as to hear of the dear Shepherd who laid down His
life for them."

"Even so, even so," said the Superior, with animation; "and it is the
thought of these sweet hearts that comforts me when my soul is among
lions. The foundation standeth sure,--the Lord knoweth them that are
his."

"And it is good and encouraging," said Father Antonio, "to see the
zeal of the poor, who will give their last penny for the altar of the
Lord, and who flock so to hear the word and take the sacraments. I have
had precious seasons of preaching and confessing, and have worked in
blessedness many days restoring and beautifying the holy pictures and
statues whereby these little ones have been comforted. What with the
wranglings of princes and the factions and disturbances in our poor
Italy, there be many who suffer in want and loss of all things, so that
no refuge remains to them but the altars of our Jesus, and none cares
for them but He."

"Brother," said the Superior, "there be thousands of flowers fairer
than man ever saw that grow up in waste places and in deep dells
and shades of mountains; but God bears each one in his heart, and
delighteth Himself in silence with them: and so doth He with these
poor, simple, unknown souls. The True Church is not a flaunting queen
who goes boldly forth among men displaying her beauties, but a veiled
bride, a dove that is in the cleft of the rocks, whose voice is known
only to the Beloved. Ah! when shall the great marriage-feast come, when
all shall behold her glorified? I had hoped to see the day here in
Italy: but now"--

The father stopped, and seemed to lapse into unconscious musing,--his
large eye growing fixed and mysterious in its expression.

"The brothers have been telling me somewhat of the tribulations you
have been through," said Father Antonio, who thought he saw a good
opening to introduce the subject nearest his heart.

"No more of that!--no more!" said the Superior, turning away his head
with an expression of pain and weariness, "rather let us look up. What
think you, brother, are all these doing now?" he said, pointing
to the saints in the picture. "They are all alive and well, and see
clearly through our darkness." Then, rising up, he added, solemnly,
"Whatever man may say or do, it is enough for me to feel that my
dearest Lord and his blessed Mother and all the holy archangels, the
martyrs and prophets and apostles, are with me. The end is coming."

"But, dearest father," said Antonio, "think you the Lord will suffer
the wicked to prevail?"

"It may be for a time," said Savonarola. "As for me, I am in His hands
only as an instrument. He is master of the forge and handles the
hammer, and when He has done using it He casts it from Him. Thus He
did with Jeremiah, whom He permitted to be stoned to death when his
preaching mission was accomplished; and thus He may do with this
hammer when He has done using it."

At this moment a monk rushed into the room with a face expressive of
the utmost terror, and called out,--

"Father, what shall we do? The mob are surrounding the convent! Hark!
hear them at the doors!"

In truth, a wild, confused roar of mingled shrieks, cries, and blows
came in through the open door of the apartment; and the pattering sound
of approaching footsteps was heard like showering rain-drops along the
cloisters.

"Here come Messer Nicolo de' Lapi, and Francesco Valori!" called out a
voice.

The room was soon filled with a confused crowd, consisting of
distinguished Florentine citizens, who had gained admittance through a
secret passage, and the excited novices and monks.

"The streets outside the convent are packed close with men," cried one
of the citizens; "they have stationed guards everywhere to cut off our
friends who might come to help us."

"I saw them seize a young man who was quietly walking, singing psalms,
and slay him on the steps of the Church of the Innocents," said
another; "they cried and hooted, 'No more psalm-singing!'"

"And there's Arnolfo Battista," said a third;--"he went out to try
to speak to them, and they have killed him,--cut him down with their
sabres."

"Hurry! hurry! barricade the door! arm yourselves!" was the cry from
other voices.

"Shall we fight, father? Shall we defend ourselves?" cried others, as
the monks pressed around their Superior.

When the crowd first burst into the room, the face of the Superior
flushed, and there was a slight movement of surprise; then he seemed to
recollect himself, and murmuring, "I expected this, but not so soon,"
appeared lost in mental prayer. To the agitated inquiries of his flock,
he answered, "No, brothers; the weapons of monks must be spiritual, not
carnal." Then lifting on high a crucifix, he said, "Come with me, and
let us walk in solemn procession to the altar, singing the praises of
our God."

The monks, with the instinctive habit of obedience, fell into
procession behind their leader, whose voice, clear and strong, was
heard raising the Psalm, "Quare fremunt gentes:"--

"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying,--

"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them
in derision."

As one voice after another took up the chant, the solemn enthusiasm
rose and deepened, and all present, whether ecclesiastics or
laymen, fell into the procession and joined in the anthem. Amid the
wild uproar, the din and clatter of axes, the thunders of heavy
battering-implements on the stone walls and portals, came this
long-drawn solemn wave of sound, rising and falling,--now drowned in
the savage clamors of the mob, and now bursting out clear and full like
the voices of God's chosen amid the confusion and struggles of all the
generations of this mortal life.

White-robed and grand the procession moved on, while the pictured
saints and angels on the walls seemed to smile calmly down upon them
from a golden twilight. They passed thus into the sacristy, where with
all solemnity and composure they arrayed their Father and Superior
for the last time in his sacramental robes, and then, still chanting,
followed him to the high altar, where all bowed in prayer. And still,
whenever there was a pause in the stormy uproar and fiendish clamor,
might be heard the clear, plaintive uprising of that strange singing,
"O Lord, save thy people, and bless thine heritage!"

It needs not to tell in detail what history has told of that tragic
night: how the doors at last were forced, and the mob rushed in; how
citizens and friends, and many of the monks themselves, their instinct
of combativeness overcoming their spiritual beliefs, fought valiantly,
and used torches and crucifixes for purposes little contemplated when
they were made.

Fiercest among the combatants was Agostino, who three times drove
back the crowd as they were approaching the choir, where Savonarola
and his immediate friends were still praying. Father Antonio, too,
seized a sword from the hand of a fallen man and laid about him with
an impetuosity which would be inexplicable to any who do not know what
force there is in gentle natures when the objects of their affections
are assailed. The artist monk fought for his master with the blind
desperation with which a woman fights over the cradle of her child.

All in vain! Past midnight, and the news comes that artillery is
planted to blow down the walls of the convent, and the magistracy, who
up to this time have lifted not a finger to repress the tumult, send
word to Savonarola to surrender himself to them, together with the two
most active of his companions, Fra Domenico da Pescia and Fra Silvestro
Maruffi, as the only means of averting the destruction of the whole
order. They offer him assurances of protection and safe return, which
he does not in the least believe: nevertheless, he feels that his hour
is come, and gives himself up.

His preparations were all made with a solemn method which showed that
he felt he was approaching the last act in the drama of life. He called
together his flock, scattered and forlorn, and gave them his last
words of fatherly advice, encouragement, and comfort,--ending with the
remarkable declaration, "A Christian's life consists in doing good and
suffering evil." "I go with joy to this marriage-supper," he said, as
he left the church for the last sad preparations. He and his doomed
friends then confessed and received the sacrament, and after that
he surrendered himself into the hands of the men who he felt in his
prophetic soul had come to take him to torture and to death.

As he gave himself into their hands, he said, "I commend to your care
this flock of mine, and these good citizens of Florence who have been
with us;" and then once more turning to his brethren, said, "Doubt not,
my brethren. God will not fail to perfect His work. Whether I live or
die, He will aid and console you."

At this moment there was a struggle with the attendants in the outer
circle of the crowd, and the voice of Father Antonio was heard crying
out earnestly, "Do not hold me! I will go with him! I must go with him!"

"Son," said Savonarola, "I charge you on your obedience not to come. It
is I and Fra Domenico who are to die for the love of Christ." And thus,
at the ninth hour of the night, he passed the threshold of San Marco.

As he was leaving, a plaintive voice of distress was heard from a young
novice who had been peculiarly dear to him, who stretched his hands
after him, crying, "Father! father! why do you leave us desolate?"
Whereupon he turned back a moment, and said, "God will be your help.
If we do not see each other again in this world, we surely shall in
heaven."

When the party had gone forth, the monks and citizens stood looking
into each other's faces, listening with dismay to the howl of wild
ferocity that was rising around the departing prisoner.

"What shall we do?" was the outcry from many voices.

"I know what I shall do," said Agostino. "If any man here will find me
a fleet horse, I will start for Milan this very hour; for my uncle is
now there on a visit, and he is a counselor of weight with the King of
France: we must get the King to interfere."

"Good! good! good!" rose from a hundred voices.

"I will go with you," said Father Antonio. "I shall have no rest till I
do something."

"And I," quoth Jacopo Niccolini, "will saddle for you, without delay,
two horses of part Arabian blood, swift of foot, and easy, and which
will travel day and night without sinking."




CHAPTER XXII

THE CATHEDRAL


The rays of the setting sun were imparting even more than their wonted
cheerfulness to the airy and bustling streets of Milan. There was the
usual rush and roar of busy life which mark the great city, and the
display of gay costumes and brilliant trappings proper to a ducal
capital which at that time gave the law to Europe in all matters of
taste and elegance, even as Paris does now. It was, in fact, from the
reputation of this city in matters of external show that our English
term Milliner was probably derived; and one might well have believed
this, who saw the sweep of the ducal cortege at this moment returning
in pomp from the afternoon airing. Such glittering of gold-embroidered
mantles, such bewildering confusion of colors, such flashing of jewelry
from cap and dagger-hilt and finger-ring, and even from bridle and
stirrup, testified that the male sex at this period in Italy were no
whit behind the daughters of Eve in that passion for personal adornment
which our age is wont to consider exclusively feminine. Indeed,
all that was visible to the vulgar eye of this pageant was wholly
masculine; though no one doubted that behind the gold-embroidered
curtains of the litters which contained the female notabilities of the
court still more dazzling wonders might be concealed. Occasionally
a white jeweled hand would draw aside one of these screens, and a
pair of eyes brighter than any gems would peer forth; and then there
would be tokens of a visible commotion among the plumed and gemmed
cavaliers around, and one young head would nod to another with jests
and quips, and there would be bowing and curveting and all the antics
and caracolings supposable among gay young people on whom the sun shone
brightly, and who felt the world going well around them, and deemed
themselves the observed of all observers.

Meanwhile, the mute, subservient common people looked on all this as
a part of their daily amusement. Meek dwellers in those dank, noisome
caverns, without any opening but a street-door, which are called
dwelling-places in Italy, they lived in uninquiring good-nature,
contentedly bringing up children on coarse bread, dirty cabbage-stumps,
and other garbage, while all that they could earn was sucked upward by
capillary attraction to nourish the extravagance of those upper classes
on which they stared with such blind and ignorant admiration.

This was the lot they believed themselves born for, and which every
exhortation of their priests taught them to regard as the appointed
ordinance of God. The women, to be sure, as women always will be,
were true to the instinct of their sex, and crawled out of the damp
and vile-smelling recesses of their homes with solid gold ear-rings
shaking in their ears, and their blue-black lustrous hair ornamented
with a glittering circle of steel pins or other quaint coiffure.
There was sense in all this: for had not even Dukes of Milan been
found so condescending and affable as to admire the charms of the
fair in the lower orders, whence had come sons and daughters who took
rank among princes and princesses? What father, or what husband,
would be insensible to prospects of such honor? What priest would
not readily absolve such sin? Therefore one might have observed more
than one comely dark-eyed woman, brilliant as some tropical bird in
the colors of her peasant dress, who cast coquettish glances toward
high places, not unacknowledged by patronizing nods in return, while
mothers and fathers looked on in triumph. These were the days for
the upper classes; the Church bore them all in her bosom as a tender
nursing-mother, and provided for all their little peccadilloes with
even grandmotherly indulgence, and in return the world was immensely
deferential towards the Church; and it was only now and then some
rugged John Baptist, in raiment of camel's hair, like Savonarola,
who dared to speak an indecorous word of God's truth in the ear of
power, and Herod and Herodias had ever at hand the good old recipe for
quieting such disturbances. John Baptist was beheaded in prison, and
then all the world and all the Scribes and Pharisees applauded; and
only a few poor disciples were found to take up the body and go and
tell Jesus.

The whole piazza around the great Cathedral is at this moment full of
the dashing cavalcade of the ducal court, looking as brilliant in the
evening light as a field of poppy, corn-flower, and scarlet clover
at Sorrento; and there, amid the flutter and rush, the amours and
intrigues, the court scandal, the laughing, the gibing, the glitter,
and dazzle, stands that wonderful Cathedral, that silent witness, that
strange, pure, immaculate mountain of airy, unearthly loveliness,--the
most striking emblem of God's mingled vastness and sweetness that
ever it was given to human heart to devise or hands to execute. If
there be among the many mansions of our Father above, among the houses
not made with hands, aught purer and fairer, it must be the work of
those grand spirits who inspired and presided over the erection of
this celestial miracle of beauty. In the great, vain, wicked city,
all alive with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
pride of life, it seemed to stand as much apart and alone as if it
were in the solemn desolation of the Campagna, or in one of the wide
deserts of Africa,--so little part or lot did it appear to have in
anything earthly, so little to belong to the struggling, bustling
crowd who beneath its white dazzling pinnacles seemed dwarfed into
crawling insects. They who could look up from the dizzy, frivolous
life below saw far, far above them, in the blue Italian air, thousands
of glorified saints standing on a thousand airy points of brilliant
whiteness, ever solemnly adoring. The marble which below was somewhat
touched and soiled with the dust of the street seemed gradually to
refine and brighten as it rose into the pure regions of the air,
till at last in those thousand distant pinnacles it had the ethereal
translucence of wintry frost-work, and now began to glow with the
violet and rose hues of evening, in solemn splendor.

The ducal cortege sweeps by; but we have mounted the dizzy, dark
staircase that leads to the roof, where, amid the bustling life of the
city there is a promenade of still and wondrous solitude. One seems
to have ascended in those few moments far beyond the tumult and dust
of earthly things, to the silence, the clearness, the tranquillity of
ethereal regions. The noise of the rushing tides of life below rises
only in a soft and distant murmur; while around, in the wide, clear
distance, is spread a prospect which has not on earth its like or its
equal. The beautiful plains of Lombardy lie beneath like a map, and the
northern horizon-line is glittering with the entire sweep of the Alps,
like a solemn senate of archangels with diamond mail and glittering
crowns. Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa with its countenance of light, the
Jungfrau and all the weird brothers of the Oberland, rise one after
another to the delighted gaze, and the range of the Tyrol melts far off
into the blue of the sky. On another side, the Apennines, with their
picturesque outlines and cloud-spotted sides, complete the enclosure.
All around, wherever the eye turns, is the unbroken phalanx of
mountains; and this temple, with its thousand saintly statues standing
in attitudes of ecstasy and prayer, seems like a worthy altar and
shrine for the beautiful plain which the mountains enclose: it seems to
give all Northern Italy to God.

The effect of the statues in this high, pure air, in this solemn,
glorious scenery, is peculiar. They seem a meet companionship for
these exalted regions. They seem to stand exultant on their spires,
poised lightly as ethereal creatures, the fit inhabitants of the pure
blue sky. One feels that they have done with earth; one can fancy
them a band of white-robed kings and priests forever ministering in
that great temple of which the Alps and the Apennines are the walls
and the Cathedral the heart and centre. Never were Art and Nature so
majestically married by Religion in so worthy a temple.

One form could be discerned standing in rapt attention, gazing from a
platform on the roof upon the far-distant scene. He was enveloped in
the white coarse woolen gown of the Dominican monks, and seemed wholly
absorbed in meditating on the scene before him, which appeared to move
him deeply; for, raising his hands, he repeated aloud from the Latin
Vulgate the words of an Apostle:--

"Accessistis ad Sion montem et civitatem Dei viventis, Jerusalem
cælestem, et multorum millium angelorum frequentiam, ecclesiam
primitivorum, qui inscripti sunt in cælis."[11]

    [11] "Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the
         living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
         company of angels, to the general assembly and church of
         the first-born, which are written in heaven."

At this moment the evening worship commenced within the Cathedral, and
the whole building seemed to vibrate with the rising swell of the great
organ, while the grave, long-drawn tones of the Ambrosian Liturgy rose
surging in waves and dying away in distant murmurs, like the rolling
of the tide on some ocean-shore. The monk turned and drew near to the
central part of the roof to listen, and as he turned he disclosed the
well-known features of Father Antonio.

Haggard, weary, and travel-worn, his first impulse, on entering the
city, was to fly to this holy solitude, as the wandering sparrow of
sacred song sought her nest amid the altars of God's temple. Artist no
less than monk, he found in this wondrous shrine of beauty a repose
both for his artistic and his religious nature; and while waiting for
Agostino Sarelli to find his uncle's residence, he had determined to
pass the interval in this holy solitude. Many hours had he paced alone
up and down the long promenades of white marble which run everywhere
between forests of dazzling pinnacles and flying buttresses of airy
lightness. Now he rested in fixed attention against the wall above the
choir, which he could feel pulsating with throbs of sacred sound, as if
a great warm heart were beating within the fair marble miracle, warming
it into mysterious life and sympathy.

"I would now that boy were here to worship with me," he said. "No
wonder the child's faith fainteth: it takes such monuments as these of
the Church's former days to strengthen one's hopes. Ah, woe unto those
by whom such offense cometh!"

At this moment the form of Agostino was seen ascending the marble
staircase.

The eye of the monk brightened as he came towards him. He put out
one hand eagerly to take his, and raised the other with a gesture of
silence.

"Look," he said, "and listen! Is it not the sound of many waters and
mighty thunderings?"

Agostino stood subdued for the moment by the magnificent sights
and sounds; for, as the sun went down, the distant mountains grew
every moment more unearthly in their brilliancy; and as they lay in
a long line, jeweled brightness mingling with the cloud-wreaths of
the far horizon, one might have imagined that he in truth beheld the
foundations of that celestial city of jasper, pearl, and translucent
gold which the Apostle saw, and that the risings and fallings of
choral sound which seemed to thrill and pulsate through the marble
battlements were indeed that song like many waters sung by the Church
Triumphant above.

For a few moments the monk and the young man stood in silence, till at
length the monk spoke.

"You have told me, my son, that your heart often troubles you in being
more Roman than Christian; that you sometimes doubt whether the Church
on earth be other than a fiction or a fable. But look around us. Who
are these, this great multitude who praise and pray continually in this
temple of the upper air? These are they who have come out of great
tribulation, having washed their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb. These are not the men that have sacked cities, and made
deserts, and written their triumphs in blood and carnage. These be men
that have sheltered the poor, and built houses for orphans, and sold
themselves into slavery to redeem their brothers in Christ. These be
pure women who have lodged saints, brought up children, lived holy and
prayerful lives. These be martyrs who have laid down their lives for
the testimony of Jesus. There were no such churches in old Rome,--no
such saints."

"Well," said Agostino, "one thing is certain. If such be the True
Church, the Pope and the Cardinals of our day have no part in it; for
they are the men who sack cities and make desolations, who devour
widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. Let us see one of
them selling himself into slavery for the love of anybody, while they
seek to keep all the world in slavery to themselves!"

"That is the grievous declension our master weeps over," said the
monk. "Ah, if the Bishops of the Church now were like brave old Saint
Ambrose, strong alone by faith and prayer, showing no more favor to an
unrepentant Emperor than to the meanest slave, then would the Church
be a reality and a glory! Such is my master. Never is he afraid
of the face of king or lord, when he has God's truth to speak. You
should have heard how plainly he dealt with our Lorenzo de' Medici on
his death-bed,--how he refused him absolution, unless he would make
restitution to the poor and restore the liberties of Florence."

"I should have thought," said the young man, sarcastically, "that
Lorenzo the Magnificent might have got absolution cheaper than that.
Where were all the bishops in his dominion, that he must needs send for
Jerome Savonarola?"

"Son, it is ever so," replied the monk. "If there be a man that cares
neither for Duke nor Emperor, but for God alone, then Dukes and
Emperors would give more for his good word than for a whole dozen of
common priests."

"I suppose it is something like a rare manuscript or a singular gem:
these virtuosi have no rest till they have clutched it. The thing
they cannot get is always the thing they want."

"Lorenzo was always seeking our master," said the monk. "Often would
he come walking in our gardens, expecting surely he would hasten down
to meet him; and the brothers would run all out of breath to his cell
to say, 'Father, Lorenzo is in the garden.' 'He is welcome,' would he
answer, with his pleasant smile. 'But, father, will you not descend
to meet him?' 'Hath he asked for me?' 'No.' 'Well, then, let us not
interrupt his meditations,' he would answer, and remain still at his
reading, so jealous was he lest he should seek the favor of princes and
forget God, as does all the world in our day."

"And because he does not seek the favor of the men of this world he
will be trampled down and slain. Will the God in whom he trusts defend
him?"

The monk pointed expressively upward to the statues that stood
glorified above them, still wearing a rosy radiance, though the
shadows of twilight had fallen on all the city below.

"My son," he said, "the victories of the True Church are not in time,
but in eternity. How many around us were conquered on earth that
they might triumph in heaven! What saith the Apostle? 'They were
tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better
resurrection.'"

"But, alas!" said Agostino, "are we never to see the right triumph
here? I fear that this noble name is written in blood, like so many of
whom the world is not worthy. Can one do nothing to help it?"

"How is that? What have you heard?" said the monk, eagerly. "Have you
seen your uncle?"

"Not yet; he is gone into the country for a day,--so say his servants.
I saw, when the Duke's court passed, my cousin, who is in his train,
and got a moment's speech with him; and he promised, that, if I would
wait for him here, he would come to me as soon as he could be let off
from his attendance. When he comes, it were best that we confer alone."

"I will retire to the southern side," said the monk, "and await the end
of your conference;" and with that he crossed the platform on which
they were standing, and, going down a flight of white marble steps, was
soon lost to view amid the wilderness of frost-like carved work.

He had scarcely vanished, before footsteps were heard ascending the
marble staircase on the other side, and the sound of a voice humming a
popular air of the court.

The stranger was a young man of about five-and-twenty, habited with all
that richness and brilliancy of coloring which the fashion of the day
permitted to a young exquisite. His mantle of purple velvet falling
jauntily off from one shoulder disclosed a doublet of amber satin
richly embroidered with gold and seed-pearl. The long white plume
which drooped from his cap was held in its place by a large diamond
which sparkled like a star in the evening twilight. His finely moulded
hands were loaded with rings, and ruffles of the richest Venetian
lace encircled his wrists. He had worn over all a dark cloak with a
peaked hood, the usual evening disguise in Italy; but as he gained
the top-stair of the platform, he threw it carelessly down and gayly
offered his hand.

"Good even to you, cousin mine! So you see I am as true to my
appointment as if your name were Leonora or Camilla instead of
Agostino. How goes it with you? I wanted to talk with you below, but I
saw we must have a place without listeners. Our friends the saints are
too high in heavenly things to make mischief by eavesdropping."

"Thank you, Cousin Carlos, for your promptness. And now to the point.
Did your father, my uncle, get the letter I wrote him about a month
since?"

"He did; and he bade me treat with you about it. It's an abominable
snarl, this, they have got you into. My father says, your best way
is to come straight to him in France, and abide till things take a
better turn: he is high in favor with the King and can find you a very
pretty place at court, and he takes it upon him in time to reconcile
the Pope. Between you and me, the old Pope has no special spite in
the world against you: he merely wants your lands for his son, and
as long as you prowl round and lay claim to them, why, you must stay
excommunicated; but just clear the coast and leave them peaceably and
he will put you back into the True Church, and my father will charge
himself with your success. Popes don't last forever, or there may come
another falling out with the King of France, and either way there will
be a chance of your being one day put back into your rights; meanwhile,
a young fellow might do worse than have a good place in our court."

During this long monologue, which the young speaker uttered with all
the flippant self-sufficiency of worldly people with whom the world is
going well, the face of the young nobleman who listened presented a
picture of many strong contending emotions.

"You speak," he said, "as if man had nothing to do in this world but
seek his own ease and pleasure. What lies nearest my heart is not that
I am plundered of my estates, and my house uprooted, but it is that my
beautiful Rome, the city of my fathers, is a prisoner under the heel
of the tyrant. It is that the glorious religion of Christ, the holy
faith in which my mother died, the faith made venerable by all these
saints around us, is made the tool and instrument of such vileness and
cruelty that one is tempted to doubt whether it were not better to have
been born of heathen in the good old times of the Roman Republic,--God
forgive me for saying so! Does the most Christian King of France know
that the man who pretends to rule in the name of Christ is not a
believer in the Christian religion,--that he does not believe even in a
God,--that he obtained the holy seat by simony,--that he uses all its
power to enrich a brood of children whose lives are so indecent that it
is a shame to modest lips even to say what they do?"

"Why, of course," said the other, "the King of France is pretty well
informed about all these things. You know old King Charles, when he
marched through Italy, had more than half a mind, they say, to pull the
old Pope out of his place; and he might have done it easily. My father
was in his train at that time, and he says the Pope was frightened
enough. Somehow they made it all up among them, and settled about their
territories, which is the main thing, after all; and now our new King,
I fancy, does not like to meddle with him: between you and me, he
has his eye in another direction here. This gay city would suit him
admirably, and he fancies he can govern it as well as it is governed
now. My father does not visit here with his eyes shut, I can tell you.
But as to the Pope--Well, you see such things are delicate to handle.
After all, my dear Agostino, we are not priests,--our business is with
this world; and, no matter how they came by them, these fellows have
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and one cannot afford to quarrel
with them,--we must have the ordinances, you know, or what becomes of
our souls? Do you suppose, now, that I should live as gay and easy a
life as I do, if I thought there were any doubt of my salvation? It's a
mercy to us sinners that the ordinances are not vitiated by the sins of
the priests; it would go hard with us, if they were: as it is, if they
will live scandalous lives, it is their affair, not ours."

"And is it nothing," replied the other, "to a true man who has taken
the holy vows of knighthood on him, whether his Lord's religion be
defamed and dishonored and made a scandal and a scoffing? Did not all
Europe go out to save Christ's holy sepulchre from being dishonored
by the feet of the Infidel? and shall we let infidels have the very
house of the Lord, and reign supreme in his holy dwelling-place? There
has risen a holy prophet in Italy, the greatest since the time of
Saint Francis, and his preaching hath stirred all hearts to live more
conformably with our holy faith; and now for his pure life and good
works he is under excommunication of the Pope, and they have seized and
imprisoned him, and threaten his life."

"Oh, you mean Savonarola," said the other. "Yes, we have heard of
him,--a most imprudent, impracticable fellow, who will not take advice
nor be guided. My father, I believe, thought well of him once, and
deemed that in the distracted state of Italy he might prove serviceable
in forwarding some of his plans: but he is wholly wrapt up in his own
notions; he heeds no will but his own."

"Have you heard anything," said Agostino, "of a letter which he wrote
to the King of France lately, stirring him up to call a General Council
of the Christian Church to consider what is to be done about the
scandals at Rome?"

"Then he has written one, has he?" replied the young man; "then the
story that I have heard whispered about here must be true. A man who
certainly is in a condition to know told me day before yesterday that
the Duke had arrested a courier with some such letter, and sent it on
to the Pope: it is likely, for the Duke hates Savonarola. If that be
true, it will go hard with him yet; for the Pope has a long arm for an
enemy."

"And so," said Agostino, with an expression of deep concern, "that
letter, from which the good man hoped so much, and which was so
powerful, will only go to increase his danger!"
