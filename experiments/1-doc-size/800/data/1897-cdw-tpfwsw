peared in 1 641. It was brought down 
to the death of James in 1625, when, he 
having written the introduction to the 
life of Charles I., the storm of the season caused him to " break off in amazement," for he had thought the race of 
"Stewards" likely to continue to the 
" world's end " ; and he never resumed 
his pen. In the reign of James two 
things lost their lustre — the exercise of 
tilting, which Elizabeth made a special 
solemnity, and the band of Yeomen of 
the Guard, choicest persons both for stature and other good parts, who graced 
the court of Elizabeth; James " was so 
intentive to Realities that he little regarded shows," and in his time these 
came utterly to be neglected. The virgin 
queen was the last ruler who seriously 
regarded the pomps and splendors of 
feudalism. 

It was characteristic of the age that 
the death of James, which occurred in 
his fifty-ninth year, should have been 
by rumor attributed to "poyson"; but 
" being dead, and his body opened, there 
was no sign at all of poyson, his inward 
parts being all sound, but that his Spleen 
was a little faulty, which might be cause 
enough to cast him into an Ague : the 
ordinary high - way, especially in old 
bodies, to a natural death." 

The chronicler records among the 
men of note of James's time Sir Francis 
Vere, " who as another Hannibal, with 
his one eye, could see more in the Martial Discipline than common men can do 
with two "; Sir Edward Coke ; Sir Francis Bacon, " who besides his profounder 
book, of Novum Organum, hath written 
the reign of King Henry the Seventh, 
in so sweet a style, that like Manna, it 
pleaseth the tast of all palats "; Will- 
iam Camden, whose Description of Brit- 
ain " seems to keep Queen Elizabeth 
alive after death"; " and to speak it in 
a word, the Trojan Horse was not fuller 
of Heroick Grecians, than King James 
his Reign was full of men excellent in 
all kindes of Learning." Among these 
was an old university acquaintance of 
Baker's, " Mr. John Dunne, who leav- 
ing Oxford, lived at the Innes of Court, 
not dissolute, but very neat ; a great 
Visitor of Ladies, a great frequenter 
of Playes, a great writer of conceited 
Verses ; until such times as King James 
taking notice of the pregnancy of his 
Wit, was a means that he betook him 
to the study of Divinity, and thereupon 
proceeding Doctor, was made Dean of 
Pauls ; and became so rare a Preacher, 
that he was not only commended, but 
even admired by all who heard him." 

The times of Elizabeth and James 
were visited by some awful casualties 
and portents. From December, 1602, to 
the December following, the plague de- 
stroyed 30,518 persons in London; the 
same disease that in the sixth year of 
Elizabeth killed 20,500, and in the 
thirty-sixth year 17,890, besides the lord 
mayor and three aldermen. In Jan- 
uary, 1606, a mighty whale came up the 
Thames within eight miles of London, 
whose body, seen divers times above 
water, was judged to be longer than the 
largest ship on the river ; " but when she 
tasted the fresh water and scented the 
Land, she returned into the sea." Not 
so fortunate was a vast whale cast upon 
the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, in 1575, 
which was " twenty Ells long, and thirteen foot broad from the belly to the 
backbone, and eleven foot between the 
eyes. One of his eyes being taken out 
of his head was more than a cart with 
six horses could draw; the Oyl being 
boyled out of his head was Parmacittee." Nor the monstrous fish cast ashore 
in Lincolnshire in 1564, which measured 
six yards between the eyes and had a tail 
fifteen feet broad ; " twelve men stood 
upright in his mouth to get the Oyl." 
In 1612 a comet appeared, which in the 
opinion of Dr. Bainbridge, the great 
mathematician of Oxford, was as far 
above the moon as the moon is above 
the earth, and the sequel of it was that 





 

infinite slaughters and devastations followed it both in Germany and other coun- 
tries. In 1613, in Standish, in Lanca- 
shire, a maiden child was born having 
four legs, four arms, and one head with 
two faces — the one before, the other be- 
hind, like the picture of Janus. (One 
thinks of the prodigies that presaged 
the birth of Glendower.) Also, the same 
year, in Hampshire, a carpenter, lying 
in bed with his wife and a young child, 
" was himself and the childe both burned 
to death with a sudden lightning, no 
fire appearing outwardly upon him, and 
yet lay burning for the space of almost 
three days till he was quite consumed to 
ashes." This year the Globe playhouse, 
on the Bankside, was burned, and the 
year following the new playhouse, the 
Fortune, in Golding Lane, " was by negligence of a candle, clean burned down 
to the ground." In this year also, 1614, 





 

the town of Stratford -on -Avon was 
burned. One of the strangest events, 
however, happened in the first year 
of Elizabeth (1558), when " dyed Sir 
Thomas Cheney, Lord Warden of the 
Cinque Ports, of whom it is reported for 
a certain, that his pulse did beat more 
than three quarters of an hour after he 
was dead, as strongly as if he had been 
still alive." In 1580 a strange apparition happened in Somersetshire — three 
score personages all clothed in black, a 
furlong in distance from those that be- 
held them ; " and after their appearing, 
and a little while tarrying, they van- 
ished away, but immediately another 
strange company, in like manner, color, 
and number appeared in the same place, 
and they encountered one another and 
so vanished away. And the third time 
appeared that number again, all in bright 
armour, and encountered one another, 





 

and so vanished away. This was ex- 
amined before Sir George Norton, and 
sworn by four honest men that saw it, 
to be true." Equally well substantiated, 
probably, was what happened in Here- 
fordshire in 1 571 : "A field of three 
acres, in Blackmore, with the Trees 
and Fences, moved from its place and 
passed over another field, travelling in 
the highway that goeth to Heme, and 
there stayed." Herefordshire was a fa- 
vorite place for this sort of exercise of 
nature. In 1575 the little town of Kin- 
naston was visited by an earthquake : 
" On the seventeenth of February at six 
o'clock of the evening, the earth began 
to open and a Hill with a Rock under it 
(making at first a great bellowing noise, 
which was heard a great way off) lifted 
itself up a great height, and began to 
travel, bearing along with it the Trees 
that grew upon it, the Sheep-folds, and 





 

Flocks of Sheep abiding there at the 
same time. In the place from whence 
it was first moved, it left a gaping distance forty foot broad, and forescore Ells 
long ; the whole Field was about twenty Acres. Passing along, it overthrew a 
Chappell standing in the way, removed 
an Ewe-Tree planted in the Churchyard, 
from the West into the East ; with the 
like force it thrust before it High-wayes, 
Sheep-folds, Hedges, and Trees, made 
Tilled ground Pasture, and again turned 
Pasture into Tillage. Having walked 
in this sort from Saturday in the evening, till Monday noon, it then stood 
still." It seems not improbable that 
Birnam wood should come to Dunsinane. 

It was for an age of faith, for a people 
whose credulity was fed on such prodigies and whose imagination glowed at 
such wonderful portents, that Shakespeare wrote, weaving into the realities 
of sense those awful mysteries of the 
supernatural which hovered not far away 
from every Englishman of his time. 

Shakespeare was born in 1564, when 
Elizabeth had been six years on the 
throne, and he died in 1616, nine years 
before James I., of the faulty spleen, 
was carried to the royal chapel in West- 
minster, " with great solemnity, but with 
greater lamentation." Old Baker, who 
says of himself that he was the unwor- 
thiest of the knights made at Theobald's, 
condescends to mention William Shake- 
speare at the tail end of the men of note 
of Elizabeth's time. The ocean is not 
more boundless, he affirms, than the 
number of men of note of her time ; and 
after he has finished with the statesmen 
(" an exquisite statesman for his own 
ends was Robert Earl of Leicester, and 
for his Countries good, Sir William Ce- 





 

till, Lord Burleigh"), the seamen, the 
great commanders, the learned gentle- 
men and writers (among them Roger 
Askam, who had sometime been school- 
master to Queen Elizabeth, but, taking 
too great delight in gaming and cock- 
fighting, lived and died in mean estate), 
the learned divines and preachers, he 
concludes: " After such men, it might 
be thought ridiculous to speak of Stage- 
players ; but seeing excellency in the 
meanest things deserve remembring, 
and Roscius the Comedian is recorded in 
History with such commendation, it may 
be allowed us to do the like with some 
of our Nation. Richard Bourbidge and 
Edward Allen, two such actors as no 
age must ever look to see the like ; and 
to make their Comedies compleat, Rich- 
ard Tarleton, who for the Part called 
the Clowns Part, never had his match, 
never will have. For Writers of Playes, 





 

and such as have been players them- 
selves, William Shakespeare and Ben- 
jamin Johnson have especially left their 
Names recommended to posterity." 

Richard Bourbidge (or Burbadge) was 
the first of the great English tragic ac- 
tors, and was the original of the great- 
er number of Shakespeare's heroes — 
Hamlet, Othello, Lear, Shylock, Mac- 
beth, Richard III., Romeo, Brutus, etc. 
Dick Tarleton, one of the privileged 
scapegraces of social life, was regarded 
by his contemporaries as the most witty 
of clowns and comedians. The clown 
was a permitted character in the old 
theatres, and intruded not only between 
the acts, but even into the play itself, 
with his quips and antics. It is prob- 
able that he played the part of clown, 
grave-digger, etc., in Shakespeare's comedies, and no doubt took liberties with 
his parts. It is thought that part of 





 

Hamlet's advice to the players — " and 
let those that play your clowns speak no 
more than is set down for them," etc. — 
was levelled at Tarleton. 

The question is often asked, but I 
consider it an idle one, whether Shakespeare was appreciated in his own day 
as he is now. That the age was unable 
to separate him from itself, and see his 
great stature, is probable ; that it enjoyed him with a sympathy to which we 
are strangers there is no doubt. To us 
he is inexhaustible. The more we study 
him, the more are we astonished at his 
multiform genius. In our complex civilization, there is no development of passion, or character, or trait of human nat- 
ure, no social evolution, that does not 
find expression somewhere in those marvellous plays ; and yet it is impossible 
for us to enter into a full, sympathetic 
enjoyment of those plays unless we can 




 

in some measure recreate for ourselves 
the atmosphere in which they were writ- 
ten. To superficial observation great 
geniuses come into the world at rare 
intervals in history, in a manner inde- 
pendent of what we call the progress of 
the race. It may be so ; but the form 
the genius shall take is always deter- 
mined by the age in which it appears, 
and its expression is shaped by the en- 
vironments. Acquaintance with the 
Bedouin desert life of to-day, which 
has changed little for three thousand 
years, illumines the book of Job like an 
electric light. Modern research into 
Hellenic and Asiatic life has given a 
new meaning to the Iliad and the Odys- 
sey, and greatly enhanced our enjoy- 
ment of them. A fair comprehension of 
the Divina Commedia is impossible with- 
out some knowledge of the factions that 
rent Florence ; of the wars of Guelf and 





 

Ghibelline; of the spirit that banished 
Dante, and gave him an humble tomb 
in Ravenna instead of a sepulchre in the 
pantheon of Santa Croce. Shakespeare 
was a child of his age ; it had long been 
preparing for him ; its expression culmi- 
nated in him. It was essentially a dra- 
matic age. He used the accumulated 
materials of centuries. He was play- 
wright as well as poet. His variety and 
multiform genius cannot otherwise be 
accounted for. He called in the coin- 
age of many generations, and reissued it 
purified and unalloyed, stamped in his 
own mint. There was a Hamlet prob- 
ably, there were certainly Romeos and 
Juliets, on the stage before Shakespeare. 
In him were received the imaginations, 
the inventions, the aspirations, the su- 
perstitions, the humors, the supernat- 
ural intimations ; in him met the con- 
verging rays of the genius of his age, as 




 

in a lens, to be sent onward thenceforth 
in an ever-broadening stream of light. 

It was his fortune to live not only in 
a dramatic age, but in a transition age, 
when feudalism was passing away, but 
while its shows and splendors could still 
be seriously comprehended. The dignity 
that doth hedge a king was so far abat- 
ed that royalty could be put upon the 
stage as a player's spectacle ; but the 
reality of kings and queens and court 
pageantry was not so far past that it 
did not appeal powerfully to the imag- 
inations of the frequenters of the Globe, 
the Rose, and the Fortune. They had 
no such feeling as we have in regard to 
the pasteboard kings and queens who 
strut their brief hour before us in ana- 
chronic absurdity. 

But, besides that he wrote in the 

spirit of his age, Shakespeare wrote in 

the language and the literary methods  



 

of his time. This is not more evident 
in the contemporary poets than in the 
chroniclers of that day. They all delighted in ingenuities of phrase, in neat 
turns and conceits; it was a compliment 
then to be called a " conceited" writer. 

Of all the guides to Shakespeare's 
time, there is none more profitable or 
entertaining than William Harrison, 
who wrote for Holinshed's chronicle 
" The Description of England," as it 
fell under his eyes from 1577 to 1587. 
Harrison's England is an unfailing mine 
of information for all the historians of 
the sixteenth century ; and in the edition published by the New Shakespeare 
Society, and edited, with a wealth of 
notes and contemporary references, by 
Mr. Frederick J. Furnivall, it is a new 
revelation of Shakespeare's England to 
the general reader. 

Harrison himself is an interesting 
character, and trustworthy above the 
general race' of chroniclers. He was 
born in 1534, or, to use his exactness 
of statement, "upon the 18th of April, 
hora 11, minut 4, Secunde 56, at Lon- 
don, in Cordwainer streete, otherwise 
called bowe-lane." This year was also 
remarkable as that in which " King 
Henry 8 polleth his head ; after whom 
his household and nobility, with the rest 
of his subjects do the like." It was the 
year before Anne Boleyn, haled away 
to the Tower, accused, condemned, and 
executed in the space of fourteen days, 
" with sigheingteares" said to the rough 
Duke of Norfolk, " Hither I came once 
my lord, to fetch a crown imperial; but 
now to receive, I hope, a crown immortal." In 1544, the boy was at St. 
Paul's school ; the litany in the English 
tongue, by the king's command, was 
that year sung openly in St. Paul's, and 
we have a glimpse of Harrison with the 
other children, enforced to buy those 
books, walking in general procession, as 
was appointed, before the king went to 
Boulogne. Harrison was a student at 
both Oxford and Cambridge, taking the 
degree of bachelor of divinity at the 
latter in 1569, when he had been an 
Oxford M.A. of seven years' standing. 
Before this he was household chaplain 
to Sir William Brooke, Lord Cobham, 
who gave him, in 1588-89, the rectory 
of Radwinter, in Essex, which he held 
till his death, in 1593. In 1586 he was 
installed canon of Windsor. Between 
1559 and 1 571 he married Marion Isebrande, of whom he said in his will, 
referring to the sometime supposed unlawfulness of priests' marriages, " by the 
laws of God I take and repute in all 
respects for my true and lawful wife." 
At Radwinter, the old parson, working 
in his garden, collected Roman coins, 
wrote his chronicles, and expressed his 
mind about the rascally lawyers of Es- 
sex, to whom flowed all the wealth of 
the land. The lawyers in those days ; 
stirred up contentions, and then reaped 
the profits. " Of all that ever I knew 
in Essex," says Harrison, " Denis and 
Mainford excelled, till John of Ludlow, 
alias Mason, came in place, unto whom 
in comparison these two were but children." This last did so harry a client 
for four years that the latter, still called 
upon for new fees, " went to bed, and 
within four days made an end of his 
woeful life, even with care and pensiveness." And after his death the lawyer 
so handled his son " that there was 
never sheep shorn in May, so near 
clipped of his fleece present, as he was 
of many to come." The Welsh were 
the most litigious people. A Welsh- 
man would walk up to London bare- 
legged, carrying his hose on his neck, 
to save wear and because he had no 
change, importune his countrymen till 
he got half a dozen writs, with which he 
would return to molest his neighbors, 
though no one of his quarrels was worth 
the money he paid for a single writ. 

The humblest mechanic of England 
to-day has comforts and conveniences 
which the richest nobles lacked in Har- 
rison's day, but it was nevertheless an 
age of great luxury and extravagance ; 
of brave apparel, costly and showy be- 
yond that of any Continental people, 
though wanting in refined taste ; and of 
mighty banquets, with service of massive plate, troops of attendants, and a 
surfeit of rich food and strong drink. 

In this luxury the clergy of Harrison's 
rank did not share. Harrison was poor 
on forty pounds a year. He complains 
that the clergy were taxed more than 
ever, the church having become "an 
ass whereon every man is to ride to mar- 
ket and cast his wallet." They paid 
tenths and first-fruits and subsidies, so 
that out of twenty pounds of a bene- 
fice the incumbent did not reserve more 
than £13 6s. Sd. for himself and his fam- 
ily. They had to pay for both prince 
and laity, and both grumbled at and 
slandered them. Harrison gives a good 
account of the higher clergy; he says 
the bishops were loved for their pain- 
ful diligence in their calling, and that 
the clergy of England were reputed on 
the Continent as learned divines, skil- 
ful in Greek and Hebrew and in the 
Latin tongue. There was, however, a 
scarcity of preachers and ministers in 
Elizabeth's time, and their character 
was not generally high. What could be 
expected when covetous patrons can- 
celled their debts to their servants by 
bestowing advowsons of benefices upon 
their bakers, butlers, cooks, grooms, 
pages, and lackeys — when even in the 
universities there was cheating at elec- 
tions for scholarships and fellowships, 
and gifts were for sale ! The morals of 
the clergy were, however, improved by 
frequent conferences, at which the good 
were praised and the bad reproved ; and 
these conferences were " a notable spur 
unto all the ministers, whereby to ap- 
ply their books, which otherwise (as in 
times past) would give themselves to 
hawking, hunting, tables, cards, dice, 
tipling at the ale house, shooting, and 
other like vanities." The clergy held 
a social rank with tradespeople ; their 
sons learned trades, and their daughters 
might go out to service. Jewell says 
many of them were the " basest sort 
of people " — unlearned, fiddlers, pipers, 
and what not. " Not a few," says Har- 
rison, " find fault with our thread-bare 
gowns, as if not our patrons but our 
wives were the causes of our woe." He 
thinks the ministers will be better when 
the patrons are better, and he defends 
the right of the clergy to marry and to 
leave their goods, if they have any, to 
their widows and children instead of to 
the church, or to some school or alms- 
house. What if their wives are fond, 
after the decease of their husbands, to 
bestow themselves not so advisedly as 
their calling requireth ; do not duch- 
esses, countesses, and knights' wives 
offend in the like fully so often as they ? 
And Eve, remarks the old philosopher 
of Radwinter — " Eve will be Eve, 
though Adam would say nay." 

The apparel of the clergy, at any rate, 
was more comely and decent than it 
ever was in the popish church, when 
the priests " went either in divers colors 
like players, or in garments of light hue, 
as yellow, red, green, etc. ; with their 
shoes piked, their hair crisped, their 
girdles armed with silver ; their shoes, 
spurs, bridles, etc., buckled with like 
metal ; their apparel (for the most part) 
of silk, and richly furred; their caps 
laced and buttoned with gold; so that 
to meet a priest, in those days, was to 
behold a peacock that spreadeth his tail 
when he danceth before the hen." 

Hospitality among the clergy was 
never better used, and it was increased 
by their marriage; for the meat and 
drink were prepared more orderly and 
frugally, the household was better looked 
to, and the poor oftener fed. There 
was perhaps less feasting of the rich 
in bishops' houses, and " it is thought 
much peradventure, that some bishops 
in our time do come short of the ancient 




 

gluttony and prodigality of their prede- 
cessors"; but this is owing to the cur- 
tailing of their livings, and the excessive 
prices whereunto things are grown. 

Harrison spoke his mind about digni- 
taries. He makes a passing reference 
to Thomas a Becket as " the old Cocke 
of Canturburie," who did crow in be- 
half of the see of Rome, and the " young 
cockerels of other sees did imitate his 
demeanour." He is glad that images, 
shrines, and tabernacles are removed 
out of churches. The stories in glass 
windows remain only because of the cost 
of replacing them with white panes. He 
would lft£ to stop the wakes, guilds, 
paternities, church-ales, and brides-ales, 
with all their rioting, and he thinks 
they could get on very well without the 
feasts of apostles, evangelists, martyrs, 
the holy-days after Christmas, Easter, 
and Whitsuntide, and those of the Vir- 





 

gin Mary, with the rest. " It is a world 
to see," he wrote of 1552, "how ready 
the Catholicks are to cast the commun- 
ion tables out of their churches, which 
in derision they call Oysterboards, and 
to set up altars whereon to say mass." 
And he tells with sinful gravity this tale 
of a sacrilegious sow : " Upon the 23d 
of August, the high altar of Christ 
Church in Oxford was trimly decked up 
after the popish manner; and about the 
middest of evensong, a sow cometh into 
the quire, and pulled all to the ground ; 
for which heinous fact, it is said she 
was afterwards beheaded ; but to that I 
am not privy." Think of the condition 
of Oxford when pigs went to mass ! 
Four years after this there was a sick- 
ness in England, of which a third part 
of the people did taste, and many clergy- 
men, who had prayed not to live after 
the death of Queen Mary, had their de- 




 

sire, the Lord hearing their prayer, says 
Harrison, " and intending thereby to 
give his church a breathing time." 

There were four classes in England 
— gentlemen, citizens, yeomen, and ar- 
tificers or laborers. Besides the nobles, 
any one can call himself a gentleman 
who can live without work and buy a 
coat of arms — though some of them 
" bear a bigger sail than his boat is 
able to sustain." The complaint of 
sending abroad youth to be educated is 
an old one ; Harrison says the sons of 
gentlemen went into Italy, and brought 
nothing home but mere atheism, infidel- 
ity, vicious conversation, and ambitious, 
proud behavior, and retained neither 
religion nor patriotism. Among citizens 
were the merchants, of whom Harrison 
thought there were too many ; for, like 
the lawyers, they were no furtherance to 
the commonwealth, but, raised the price 





 

of all commodities. In former, free- 
trade times, sugar was sixpence a pound, 
now it is two shillings sixpence ; rai- 
sins were one penny, and now sixpence. 
Not content with the old European 
trade, they have sought out the East 
and West Indies, and likewise Cathay 
and Tartary, whence they pretend, from 
their now and then suspicious voyages, 
they bring home great commodities. 
But Harrison cannot see that prices are 
one whit abated by this enormity, and 
certainly they carry out of England the 
best of its wares. 

The yeomen are the stable, free men, 
who for the most part stay in one place, 
working the farms of gentlemen, are 
diligent, sometimes buy the land of un- 
thrifty gentlemen, educate their sons to 
the schools and the law courts, and leave 
them money to live without labor. These 
are the men that made France afraid. 





 

Below these are the laborers and men 
who work at trades, who have no voice 
in the commonwealth, and crowds of 
young serving-men who become old beg- 
gars, highway-robbers, idle fellows, and 
spreaders of all vices. There was a 
complaint then, as now, that in many 
trades men scamped their work, but, on 
the whole, husbandmen and artificers 
had never been so good ; only there were 
too many of them, too many handicrafts 
of which the country had no need. It 
appears to be a fault all along in history 
that there are too many of almost every 
sort of people. 

In Harrison's time the greater part of 
the building in cities and towns was of 
timber, only a few of the houses of the 
commonalty being of stone. In an old 
plate giving a view of the north side 
of Cheapside, London, in 1638, we see 
little but quaint gable ends and rows of 





 

small windows set close together. The 
houses are of wood and plaster, each 
story overhanging the other, terminat- 
ing in sharp pediments ; the roofs pro- 
jecting on cantilevers, and the windows 
occupying the whole front of each of the 
lower stories. They presented a lively 
and gay appearance on holidays, when 
the pentices of the shop fronts were 
hung with colored draperies, and the 
balconies were crowded with spectators, 
and every pane of glass showed a face. 
In the open country, where timber was 
scarce, the houses were, between studs, 
impanelled with clay — red, white, or blue. 
One of the Spaniards who came over in 
the suite of Philip remarked the large 
diet in these homely cottages : " These 
English," quoth he, " have their houses 
made of sticks and dirt, but they 
fare commonly so well as the king." 
" Whereby it appeareth," comments 





 

Harrison, " that he liked better of our 
good fare in such coarse cabins, than of 
their own thin diet in their prince-like 
habitations and palaces." The timber 
houses were covered with tiles ; the other 
sort with straw or reeds. The fairest 
houses were ceiled within with mortar 
and covered with plaster, the whiteness 
and evenness of which excited Harrison's 
admiration. The walls were hung with 
tapestry, arras-work, or painted cloth, 
whereon were divers histories, or herbs, 
or birds, or else ceiled with oak. Stoves 
had just begun to be used, and only in 
some houses of the gentry, " who build 
them not to work and feed in, as in 
Germany and elsewhere, but now and 
then to sweat in, as occasion and need 
shall require." Glass in windows, which
