 

the great concourse he put off after them, picking 
his way. But presently his forefeet went down 
pretty deep and he plunged around, and when he 
got them out he gave a big leap where the quag- 
mire was awfully soft and down he went with all 
four feet. Then he couldn’t get out, and it began 
to rain and the great marsh filled up, but he kept 
sinking deeper and deeper. When it cleared up 
the other things came back, and the great hornets 
stung him and the eagles and condors clawed him, 
the foxes and the wolves tore great pieces out of 
him and had a fine feast, and so the poor fellow 
soon died. Well, after that there was a great 
landslide that covered him up, and the earth and 
the rocks buried him, and that was thousands of 
years ago. Then there came people on the earth, 
and they cleared it up and leveled it and began to 
make houses and farms. And one day a lot of 
workmen got down to him and they threw out 
heaps of bones. And then a man with a notebook 
and a pair of spectacles came along and looked 
them over and said they were great curiosities and 
wanted them, and an Italian who was working 
on a railroad came and said, ' Me gather um, me 
gather um,’ and so he did, and put them in a great 
bag to be taken to a museum, and they strung them 
on wires and the man thought that a good name; 





but he wanted to be polite and he called it Meg-a- 
thei-um, and that’s the way it is in the dic- 
tionary.” 

“ Primrose, you have the genius of a discov- 
erer,” and Mr. Mann laughed again heartily. “ I’ll 
get the dictionary for you and you shall pay me by 
degrees.” 

“ They’re not real stories and we only tell them 
for fun, but teacher sometimes reads stories aloud 
that aren’t a bit better.” 

“ You’ll do for Scheherazade.” 

‘‘ Oh, Mr. Mann, it’s just the children’s foolish- 
ness — you know they have to amuse each other. 
We haven’t any neighbors. And we have had such 
a lovely day ! It’s just a Thanksgiving. We never 
had one like it. But we must go. There’ll be the 
fire to make up ” 

She partly rose with Laurel in her arms, and 
then leaned back again. How sort of pretty and 
girlish she looked, her cheeks flushed with the 
warmth, and that deprecating expression in her 
eyes. For a moment he stared. The children were 
expressing their joy and made quite a hub- 
bub. 

“ Oh, children ! ” she exclaimed helplessly. 
‘‘ And the twins are fast asleep.” 

Rhoda lay with her head in the lap of Amaryl- 


 

lis, and they made a pretty group on the floor. A 
curious longing pervaded the man’s heart. 

“ Mrs. Firth, please let some of them stay; the 

twins and ” he looked eagerly. Should he 

choose Prim or Marigold, so he compromised on 
Amaryllis. “ And my boy Chan here, and Tip, if 
he will ” 

Oh, yes,” interrupted Mrs. Alden. We can 
make them comfortable.” 

“ It’s too much trouble. I can’t impose on you 
so. And they haven’t any nighties,” she said, in 
a flurried tone. 

“ We can find something.” 

“ Why, you can put them in a pillowcase and 
pin it up about the neck. The Esquimau children 
are put in a fur bag with a cap over their heads 
and just a little breathing hole,” announced Mari- 
gold. 

Mrs. Firth stood Laurel on the floor and Rilla 
woke up her mate. No, she couldn’t consent to 
their staying. They would be bundled up warm 
and a good fire would soon be blazing in the stove. 
Oh, they must go, and she really appealed to Mr. 
Mann with such beseeching eyes that he gave in. 

Dan brought the sleigh around. The babies were 
bundled up head and ears, one in the mother’s 
arms, the other in the eldest sister’s. The fur robes 





were packed around tightly, and Tip and Chan ran 
back into the warm house. 

“ It seems cruel to take those little ones out,” 
said Mrs. Alden. 

“ And now, children, you must go to bed,” said 
their host. “ Tip, the bears have all hidden in 
their holes and they wouldn’t come out for ten little 
boys. Chan, my little lad, good-night.” 


CHAPTER XVI 


MAKING A DREAM COME TRUE 

Adonijah Mann came back to the room where 
the echo of children’s voices seemed to linger. 
How merry they had been ! That was what houses 
were for, to be made into delightful homes with 
children growing up in them, loving, enjoying, 
having good times that would shed a radiance all 
along manhood and womanhood. 

He took out his cigar, bit off the end, but did 
not light it. If they were here he should give up 
smoking; he had never cared much for it. With 
him it had been a lonely man’s comfort. He 
moved his chair a little so he could see the willow 
rocker where she had been sitting with the sleep- 
ing child in her arms when the thought had startled 
him. Well, why not.? It would come hard to 
have her household depleted. It would perhaps 
cause heart burnings to have two or three of them 
on the fortunate and indulged side of life and the 
others struggling with poverty. Oh, it would 
never do! 





 

What did he want with all this prosperity ? He 
was not a millionaire, but business was going on 
well with him and Mr. Ross. There would be 
enough. And why not spend it on these children 
instead of leaving it to an orphan home when he 
was dead? 

Besides, he was learning that he had a large 
social side to his nature, also a longing for affec- 
tion. He had been shut out of that, starved in 
the earlier years. He was five-and-forty now; 
there might be a quarter of a century added to his 
years — some men live to fourscore. Time enough 
to see them all grown up, the girls to have lovers 
and husbands, the boys to make their way in the 
world and have homes. Then there would be 
grandchildren. Twenty lovely, heartsome years. 
And she — he could count up her years. Married 
at twenty-three, only a little over fifteen years 
ago. Their ages would be suitable, certainly. And 
if they stayed in the little old red house the hard- 
est pull was yet to come. And the children might 
never reach the standing for which nature had 
really given them the ability. Poverty was a hard 
master and made many slaves. 

Was that Dan coming back so soon? How long 
he had sat here dreaming. He rose and went to 
the door. 


 

You left them all right? ” 

“Oh, yes. Well, it's been a great day! And 
they sang all the way home. They’re the jolliest 
crew you’d meet in a month of Mondays. They 
did have a grand good time.” 

“ Thank you.” 

“ Why, I think I’ve had a wonderful Thanks- 
giving, too,” rejoined Dan. 

Why shouldn’t they have a grand good time all 
the rest of their lives? 

The little old house was dark and cold, but they 
soon had lights and a fire and the pleasures were 
sandwiched between the discomforts, for they kept 
up a stream of gay laughter. The twins were laid 
in a bundle on the trundle-bed, while their nighties 
were brought out to warm. There were two pieces 
of soapstone on the stove heating, for the garret 
was cold. 

“ See here,” exclaimed Linn; “ I’ll bring Chan’s 
cot out here and the girls can sleep in my bed. 
With the doors open it will soon be warm all 
through.” 

“ That’s ever so good of you, Linn,” and Rilla 
kissed him. 

“After having had such a splendid day one 
ought to ” 

“ And the dinner I And that elegant fire ! And 


 


then sitting on the floor. It gave you such a good, 
homey feeling.’’ 

But you were foolish, Prim. The stories do 
here at home, but when you are out ” 

“ Momsey, we don’t often go out. No one ever 
asked us all at once except on the Sunday-school 
picnic, and then you have to take your own pro- 
visions, and they made Rilla run about and wait 
on folks. And, oh my! To have some one come 
in and take away the dinner and bring in lovely 
plates and dessert and all ! I don’t think Mr. Mann 
minded very much.” 

He enjoyed every bit of it,” declared Linn 
stoutly. “ He’s of the merry sort.” 

“ And that dimple in his cheek I Oh, I wish I 
had it ! ” confessed Marigold for about the hun- 
dredth time. 

“ And here’s a lovely big basket of things ” 

“ I’m hungry. Why, we could almost eat our 
breakfast. Oh, yes, let’s have some of these nice 
biscuits and just a bite of the ham,” begged Linn. 
“ I don’t believe we’ll ever have another such a 
feast in all our lives.” 

Mrs. Firth protested and they gave in. It was 
midnight before they were all in bed, and it was 
hard for Linn to get up by lamplight and turn 
out in the frosty morning for his more than a 


 

mile walk. But he laughed and whistled on the 
way and tried to get in every syllable of the Kron. 

Mrs. Firth did not have to go out to work, 
and there was no school until Monday. How for- 
tunate that Linn was earning a little, for her sew- 
ing was dropping off. It was quite dull last winter, 
she remembered. Most people were sewing up new 
frocks and aprons for Christmas gifts and hoard- 
ing the money to buy them. But there was work 
enough to be done at home. 

And let us cut up the rest of the rubbish into 
carpet rags,” said housewifely Amaryllis. “ If we 
could have two new breadths in the spring! I 
mean to fix up the west end of the garret real nice 
so it will look almost like a room. If we could 
only have some kind of a bureau to put our nicest 
things in, Goldie and I.” 

“ When old Mrs. Preston dies, and it can’t be 
long now, Eliza Ann is going to sell out all the 
things and go to her brother’s. It’s all hundred- 
year-old truck, like Aunt Kitty’s, but sometimes a 
piece or two comes in handy. Maybe we might 
buy something.” 

Prim told the twins Mother Goose and all the 
rhyming stories she could remember and sewed 
carpet rags almost as fast as she talked. They 
had a dinner feast from the basket. 


 


I suppose Tip and Chan are having nice things, 
and at the Beers’ there’ll be the Thanksgiving frag- 
ments for Linn, so we can eat up the good things 
without any misgivings of conscience, as Granny 
Keen calls it. I hope some one gave her a nice 
dinner. We haven’t seen her in a long while.” 

“ Poor old soul,” commented Mrs. Firth sym- 
pathetically. 

Now, Mis’ Firth,” began Marigold, in a mum- 
bling way, as if her teeth were out, would you 
druther be lost at sea er in a railroad smosh? 
’Cause if you’re wracked on the land, there you 
stand, an’ if you’re lost in the sea, there you be. 
I hain’t never been able to make up my mind.” 

It was an excellent imitation of Granny Keen, 
and one of her never-solved puzzles, rather funny, 
seeing she was not likely to journey either way. 

“ Oh, Marigold ! ” her mother protested, yet she 
laughed. 

It was almost night when Dan brought the two 
boys home. They had been taken over to Ridge- 
wood and went to some lovely stores. In one 
there was a band and the funniest little play in 
which the actors never spoke but made signs, only 
you could tell what they meant just as plain as 
day. And at another place there was a Punch 
and Judy show the like of which they had never 


 

seen before, and which Tip never tired of exploit- 
ing afterward for the benefit of the twins, but 
Rilla had to rig him up another doll. 

And he was just as good as he could be,” said 
Chan, “ and never cried a word.” 

“ Why, there wasn’t nothing to cry about,” said 
Tip, in a sort of grandiose manner. 

Chan sat down beside his mother when it was 
too dark to do anything. The others were around 
by the stove engrossed with Punch and Judy. 

“ Chan dear,” his mother began, in a low tone, 
“ did Mr. Mann say anything about — about your 
coming 

“ No, mother; but I guess it was because I said 
Fd have to stay home and help you now that 
Linn was away. But he’s awful good and sweet 
to me, and calls me his little boy, and he’s going 
to get a pretty bookcase over there for me to keep 
all those nice books in, and I can make believe 
borrow them and bring home one at a time to 
read. I know he loves me very mluch; you can 
always tell when it is real, true love, can’t you? ” 

“ Yes, dear, you surely can.” 

Wasn’t it splendid yesterday ! Oh, it makes 
such a nice thing to talk about. And the house 
is so grand and pretty. And in the summer he 
said I could learn to ride on Lady Betty, but I 


 

think I like Bonnie best. She rubs her nose in 
your hand in such a cunning way. I'm not a bit 
afraid of her, but Lady Betty looks at you and 
snaps her eyes as if she said : ' Oh, you don’t know 
the pranks I am up to ! ’ ” 

His mother laughed softly. 

“ So maybe I won’t go until next summer. We’ll 
get used to it by that time, and Tip will be bigger. 
But when I think of it I feel as if I would like 
to be two boys — twins,” with a ripple of mirth, 
so if one went there, the other could stay 
here.” 

“ That would be nice.” His mother kissed him. 

Sunday it snowed again, just a little to help up 
the roads. It didn’t matter in the country, where 
there was plenty of room and you did not have to 
hire it carted away. It was not so snapping cold 
and the sun shone like a jolly fellow, so on Mon- 
day there was almost a frolic at school, snowballing 
and building a fort. They built one every winter 
and a snow man just as big as patience and courage 
could construct. And the children were very much 
interested in the Firths’ Thanksgiving and could 
hardly understand it when this Mr. Mann wasn’t 
any real relation. 

Prim had asked Chan confidentially if Mr. Mann 
thought her very silly. 


 

** Why, no. That means foolish. He thinks 
you are smart, and he don’t see how you can think 
up such funny things. He has a big dictionary, 
and we looked up that ' meg ’ thing, and there it 
was, sure enough, only he didn’t see how you could 
put it together in such a funny fashion. Oh, a 
dictionary is splendid, but his cost eighteen dollars, 
and that’s a sight of money. I don’t think we’ve 
ever had eighteen dollars at once.” 

Well,” with a reflective sigh, “ we’ve had lots 
of fun.” 

No one wanted Mrs. Firth that week. She had 
been so busy all the fall that she quite missed it. 
There was nothing she actually needed to buy — for 
a wonder. No one wanted shoes, though she felt 
that Tip ought to have new rubber boots soon. It 
was Thursday afternoon, and she sat by the win- 
dow sewing when the sleigh drove up and Mr. 
Mann sprang out. 

She opened the door, and he stepped in, bright 
and rosy. 

“ Will you bundle up the twins and let Amaryl- 
lis take them out. Rilla, I think you do not get 
quite your share of the good things going round, 
you are such a stay-at-home, mother-like body, yet 
you are the first one I invited to ride with me — 
that day I brought you up from the store.” 


 

“ Oh, yes, I remember,” and the brown eyes 
lighted up with pleasure. 

“ Well, get ready now. It’s almost like a spring 
day, and I’m afraid it will take the snow off too 
fast. I’ve grown very fond of sleighing. That’s 
one of the enjoyable country habits. Come, get 
ready.” 

No one thought to demur. The twins were 
bundled up and had extra stockings pulled over 
their little feet and legs. Mr. Mann carried them 
out. Rilla had Lai on the seat with her and they 
were swathed like mummies, while Dan hugged 
up Rhoda with his strong arm. Bonnie was alone 
to-day. 

Then Mr. Mann led Mrs. Firth back into the 
house, and for a moment something new in his 
demeanor made her feel a little strange. 

“Won’t you sit down?” she said. Of course 
he would have to stay until Dan came back. 

“ I’ll take off my coat.” He hung it over the 
back of the chair and placed his hat on the seat. 
“ I’ve come over to talk of several matters, and 
that was why I didn’t want any audience pr any 
interruption.” 

Oh, it was about Chan. She smiled vaguely, 
but she stood still with a sort of feeling that her 
guest must be seated first. And as he studied her 


 

a flush of something akin to bashfulness stole 
over her. 

‘‘ Yes,” hardly realizing what she was saying, 
Chan ” 

“ It isn’t about Chan now. It’s about myself. 
These matters come easy enough to young people, 
I suppose, but plain old fellows like me have to go 
straight to the point. I’ve come over to ask you 
to marry me.” 

'' To — to ” She was so surprised that she 

wavered a little, and he caught her with one arm. 

Yes, to marry me.” There was almost a 
mirthful sound in his voice. 

Oh, I couldn’t,” tremulously. 

‘‘Couldn’t.? And why?” 

“ Oh, there are all the children. Eight of them. 
Any one would think you were crazy.” 

“ And the children are what I want. Why, I’ve 
wanted them all my life. She was not fond of 
children, she thought them a great bother and 
expense. And when I came to Grafton I fancied 
I would take one or two out of an institution, but 
I felt I would like to know about their mothers, 
which I couldn’t. And then I found yours in 
that funny fashion ; ” laughing from a satisfied 
heart. 

“ I had resolved to give you Chan ” 




“ And that Thanksgiving night I felt they ought 
not be separated. Then I saw you with the little 
girl in your arms and knew you were the wife I 
wanted, though I had not thought much of marry- 
ing before. Then the children would have their 
own mother.” 

“ But you can’t understand,” she pleaded. 

You have never really known about children. 
No matter how well you love them, they are a 
great care and trouble. They do so many little 
things you don’t want them to do, things that are 
not vicious, either. They dispute, too; they are not 
always kind to one another. They make a sight of 
work, and there is the great question of what you 
will do with them as they grow older, what is 
best for them. But when they are yours you love 
them and they love you, and every little life is a 
part of your own, and it would be a hard wrench to 

give any of them up ” 

And if one small woman can care for them 
as you have done, can’t a strong man with plenty 
of means come in and help carry the burden? 
Yes, let me. And let me care for you and give 
me a little love in return. That is all I ask. The 
children and some love from you.” 

“ People would think you were crazy. And 
there is that nice Mrs. Alden. She would be 


 

good to Chan, I know. She is so sweet and re- 
fined and ’’ 

“ She couldn't be quite an own mother. She 
might do for an institution child, but Chan would 
know the difference. And it would be a sin to 
part them. Then I haven’t a relative that I know 
of who could feel aggrieved, and as for outsiders, 
I don’t care a button for their opinion so long 
as I keep honest and upright myself. And I want 
you” 

She was as bad as Tip. She leaned her face 
down on his broad breast and cried softly. It 
didn’t seem as if she had any right to take so 
much. 

After some moments he raised the face and 
kissed it. She had been so much with children 
that she was simple as a child herself. Then he 
took a seat and drew her down on his knee. 

‘‘ That is all settled,” he began, in a joyous tone 
that thrilled her. “ I’ve thought it over and over 
and planned it all out. Christmas falls on Thurs- 
day. You will all come over on Wednesday morn- 
ing. I want a pretty wedding that will be some- 
thing for the children to remember. It will be 
along in the afternoon, and then there’ll be a sort 
of little feast with wedding-cake and all that. I 
shall ask only the Rosses, and your guests may be 


 

the minister and his wife. Then we’ll begin our 
lives on Christmas morning. There may be years 
of delight for us if it please God, and we shall 
see the children growing up into nice men and 
women and having a fair chance with life and 
education and all that. I don’t mean that you shall 
ever be sorry that you gave them to me, and I want 
to make you very happy. I want you to love me, 
for I’ve never had much love. I was reading 
some verses the other evening where the man 
wanted to live until he had found what ‘ some have 
found so sweet,’ and that was love.” 

She drew a long breath. What wonderful thing 
had come to her! But presently she said, with a 
scarlet face and downcast eyes : “ You are so good, 
but you don’t know — what real poverty is and the 
straits it puts you in. You see, we have the house 
and the big garden and enough to eat, and my 
pension. The neighbors have been very good. 
They see that I have all the fuel I need, and in 
killing-time they send in meats and sausage and 
all that. And I’ve earned a little money sewing 
for them. But — I couldn’t get ready, and I 
wouldn’t want to shame you. Oh, perhaps it 
wouldn’t be best ” 

“ It is all right and planned out in the best way. 
I studied it all over before I spoke. For the 


 

children’s sake you will let me have my way. 
What does it matter ? I and my money will belong 
to you and we will both enjoy it.” 

The bells gave warning. 

‘‘ This is our secret for the present ; we will not 

take any one into our counsel,” and he rose to 
open the door. 

Amaryllis laughed, with shining eyes and rosy 
cheeks. Ah! she didn’t know how soon she was 
to be his daughter and bring gladness into his life. 
They trooped in. 

“ I’ve had the loveliest ride I ” she exclaimed 
joyously. 

‘‘ I had ’ovely yide,” said Laurel, holding out 
both hands. 

Laurel Firth, if I was a big girl, going to be 
six years old next June, I would try to talk plain,” 
declared Rhoda, with a great accession of dignity. 

Mr. Mann caught her up in his arms and kissed 
her. She could afford to be the baby a while 
longer. 

She has until next June, anyhow. Miss Con- 
sequence,” he returned laughingly. 

“ And I am a thousand times obliged,” continued 
Amaryllis. “ We’ve been all over, and Linn came 
out and waved his hand to us.” 

Mr. Mann put on his fur coat. He would have 




liked to clasp Bessy Firth inside of it, and he said 
in a low tone, “ Sunday afternoon.” 

“Why, mother, you look almost as if you had 
been crying,” said Rilla. “ Is he going to take 
Chan soon.? ” 

“ Well — not very,” she replied unsteadily, and 
went to mend the fire that had dropped down. 

“ O dear ! How splendid it will be for Chan. 
And — don’t you think we can go over and visit 
him? I do like Mr. Mann so very much.” 

The mother’s face was scarlet again. She al- 
most kissed her secret into her daughter’s surprised 
look. Oh, was it really true? 


CHAPTER XVII 


A FAIRY GODFATHER 

Mrs. Ross, ma’am, I’ve taken your advice 
and am going to marry.” 

Mr. Mann had entered the cozy sitting-room 
where he was always a welcome guest. 

Oh, I am so glad,” and she gave a quick smile. 
“ Mrs. Alden, of course.” 

No, it isn’t Mrs. Alden ” 

Oh, not some foolish young thing, I hope?” 
with an expression of genuine distress. 

No, of very suitable age. It’s — it’s that little 
Chan’s mother.” 

Mr. Mann ! ” in a horrified tone. And 

aren’t there eight children? Why, you are ” 

No, in my senses. I wanted the children.” 
He laughed joyously and with a spice of mischief 
as well. “ If Mrs. Alden had had some little ones 
she would have captured me in the summer. But 
it would have been the old story. Then I thought 
I’d adopt Chan, but the loyal little fellow hated 

to give up his mother. They’re a nice, healthy lot 




 

and any man may be proud of them, and I love 
the mother. Then I’ve money enough to care for 
them all. It will be the making of eight nice 
men and women I hope. It will be as good as 
leaving some money to an orphan asylum.” 

‘‘ Well — if you are suited.” But it was only 
half-heartedly. She was so surprised. 

“ Yes, and you are about the only real woman 
friend I have. I want you to stand by me and 
help me out a little, and to come up. I’ve planned 
to be married Wednesday afternoon so the chil- 
dren can have a real Christmas. It will be at my 
house where there is plenty of room. And I 
don’t want her bothered with anything — besides I 
don’t believe she’d really know. I’m going to do 
the shopping, wedding gown and all, and I want 
your help.” 

Mrs. Ross did not like it at all, and she was 
disappointed for her friend. But on the other 
hand he had been such a good friend to them, and 
truly the author of their prosperity. Then he did 
need some woman’s counsel. How could he get 
along alone? Then, too, she, like most women, 
was interested in wedding gear. 

“ At your house,” she said, with cool delibera- 
tion, in the evening?” 

No, about four, I think, and then a little wed- 


 

ding feast. We’ll give the men a half-holiday, and 
you and Mr. Ross will come up ” 

“ We are going to mother’s,” hesitatingly. 
“ She is to come in and take the children with 
her on Tuesday, and they are to spend the whole 
vacation. We were to go Wednesday evening.” 

Wait until Thursday morning. Mr. Ross is 
willing. Then you can come up at noon, or you 
might come in the morning and he at noon.” 

The face and voice were alike persuasive. 

And the shopping, what about that?” she 
asked. 

“ Oh, when you can spare the time. Some 
things for the little girls, and — a pretty, soft 
wedding gown.” 

“ Silk? ” at a venture. 

No, I think I do not care for that. I saw 
some a few days ago. You know, if I gave her 
two or three diamonds and a handsome necklace 
and so on, that would be all right. We’ll save the 
diamonds until some other occasion,” and he gave 
a short laugh. ‘‘ Something soft and white and 
clinging ”
