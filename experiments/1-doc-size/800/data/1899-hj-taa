  

lip his mind how to meet her. "What will you have — 
when he loved my mother ?" 

Nothing conld have been droller than the gloom of her 
surprise. "Yours too ?" 

"I didn't tell you the other day — out of delicacy." 

Mrs. Brookenham darkly thought. ''He didn't tell 
me either." 

" The same consideration deterred him. But if I didn't 
speak of it/' Vanderbank continued, " when I arranged 
with you, after meeting him here at dinner, that you 
should come to tea with him at my rooms — if I didn't 
mention it then it wasn't because I hadn't learnt it 
early." 

Mrs. Brook more deeply sounded this affair, but she 
spoke with the exaggerated mildness which was the form 
her gaiety mostly took. " It was because, of course, it 
makes him out such a wretch ! What becomes in that 
case of his loyalty — ?" 

 ' To your mother's memory ? Oh, it's all right — he 
has it quite clear. She came later — mine, after my fa- 
ther's death, had refused him. But, you see, he might 
have been my step-father." 

Mrs. Brookenham took it in, but she had suddenly a 
brighter light. "He might have been my own father ! 
Besides," she went on, " if his line is to love the mothers, 
why on earth doesn't he love me? I'm in all conscience 
enough of one." 

"Ah, but isn't there in your case the fact of a daugh- 
ter ?" Vanderbank asked with a slight embarrassment. 

Mrs. Brookenham stared. "What good does that do 
me ?" 

"Why, didn't she tell you ?" 

"Nanda ? She told me he doesn't like her any better 
than he likes me." 

Vanderbank, in his turn, showed surprise. "That's 
really what she said ?" 





 

" She had on her return from your rooms a most un- 
usual fit of frankness, for she generally tells me nothing/  

''Well," said Vanderbank, "how did she put it ?" 

Mrs. Brook reflected — recovered it. "'I like him 
awfully, but Tm not in the least Ids idea.'" 

" His idea of what ?" 

''That's just what I asked her. Of the proper grand- 
child for mamma." 

Vanderbank hesitated. "Well, she isn't." Then after 
another pause: "But she ll do." 

His companion gave him a deep look. " You'll make 
her ?" 

He got up, and on seeing him move Mr. Longdon also 
rose, so that, facing each other across the room, they ex- 
changed a friendly signal or two. "I'll make her." 



XV 

Their hostess's account of Mr. Cashmere's motive for 
not staying on was so far justified as that Vanderbank, 
while Mr. Longdon came over to Mrs. Brook, appeared 
without difficulty to engage him further. The lady in 
question, meanwhile, had drawn her old friend down, and 
her present method of approach would have interested an 
observer aware of the unhappy conviction that she had 
just privately expressed. Some trace indeed of the 
glimpse of it enjoyed by Mr. Cashmere's present inter- 
locutor might have been detected in the restlessness that 
Vanderbank's desire to keep the other pair uninterrupted 
was still not able to banish from his attitude. N'ot, how- 
ever, that Mrs. Brook took the smallest account of it as 
she quickly broke out : " How can we thank you enough, 
my dear man, for your extraordinary kindness ?" The 
reference was vivid, yet Mr. Longdon looked so blank 
about it that she had immediately to explain. "I mean 





  

to dear Van, who has told us of your giving him the 
great happiness — unless he's too dreadfully mistaken — of 
letting him really know you. He's such a tremendous 
friend of ours that nothing so delightful can befall him 
without its affecting us in the same way." She had pro- 
ceeded with confidence, but suddenly she pulled up. 
   Don't tell me he is mistaken — I shouldn't be able 
to bear it." She challenged the pale old man with a 
loveliness that was for the moment absolutely juvenile. 
"Aren't you letting him — really ?" 

Mr. Longdon's smile was queer. " I can't prevent him. 
I'm not a great house — to give orders to go over me. 
The kindness is Mr. Vanderbank's own, and I've taken 
up, I'm afraid, a great deal of his time." 

"You have indeed." Mrs. Brook was undiscouraged. 
"He has been talking with me just now of nothing else. 
You may say," she went on, " that it's I who have kept 
him at it. So I have, for his pleasure's a joy to us. If 
you can't prevent what he feels, you know, you can't 
prevent, either, what you feel." 

Mr. Longdon's face reflected for a minute something 
he could scarcely have supposed her acute enough to 
make out, the struggle between his real mistrust of her, 
founded on the unconscious violence offered by her nat- 
ure to his every memory of her mother, and his sense, 
on the other hand, of the high propriety of his liking 
her ; to which latter force his interest in Vanderbank 
was a contribution, inasmuch as he was obliged to recog- 
nize on the part of the pair an alliance it would have 
been difficult to explain at Beccles. "Perhaps I don't 
quite see the value of what your husband and you and I 
are in a position to do for him." 

" Do you mean because he's himself so clever ?" 

"Well," said Mr. Longdon, "I dare say that's at the 
bottom of my feeling so proud to be taken up by him. I 
think of the young men of my time, and I see that he 





 

takes in more. But that's what you all do/' he rather 
helplessly sighed. " YouVe very, very wonderful V' 

She met him with an almost extravagant eagerness 
that the meeting should be just where he wished. " I 
don't take in everything, but I take in all I can. 
That's a great affair in London to-day, and I often feel 
as if I were a circus-woman, in pink tights and no par- 
ticular skirts, riding half a dozen horses at once. We're 
all in the troupe now, I suppose," she smiled,  ' and we 
must travel with the show. But when you say we're 
different," she added,  '' think, after all, of mamma." 

Mr. Longdon stared. " It's from her you are differ- 
ent." 

''Ah, but she had an awfully fine mind. We're not 
cleverer than she." 

His conscious, honest eyes looked aAvay an instant. 
'' It's perhaps enough, for the present, that you're cleverer than I. I was very glad, the other day," he contin- 
ued, "to make the acquaintance of your daughter. I 
hoped I should find her with you." 

If Mrs. Brook cast about, it was but for a few seconds. 
'' If she had known you were coming, she would certainly 
have been here. She wanted so to please you." Then, 
as her visitor took no further notice of this speech than 
to ask if ISTanda were out of the house, she had to admit 
it as an aggravation of failure ; but she pursued in the 
next breath : ''Of coarse you won't care, but she raves 
about you." 

He appeared indeed at first not to care. "Isn't she 
eighteen ?" — it was oddly abrupt. 

"I have to think. Wouldn't it be nearer twenty?" 
Mrs. Brook audaciously returned. Then she tried again. 
"She told me all about your interview. I staid away 
on purpose — I had my idea." 

" And what was your idea ?" 

"I thought she would remind you more of mamma if 





  

I wasn't there. But she's a little person who sees. Per- 
haps you didn't think it, but she kneAv." 

''And what did she know T' asked Mr. Longdon, who 
was unable, however, to keep from his tone a certain 
coldness which really deprived the question of its proper 
curiosity. 

Mrs. Brook just showed the chill of it, but she had al- 
ways her courage. '' Why, that you don't like her." She 
had the courage of carrying off as well as of backing out. 
''She too has her little place with the circus — it's the 
way we earn our living." 

Mr. Longdon said nothing for a moment, and when he 
at last spoke it was almost with an air of contradiction. 
 '' She's your mother to the life." 

His hostess, for three seconds, looked at him hard. 
''Ah, but with such differences! You'll lose it," she 
added with a head-shake of pity. 

He had his eyes only on Vanderbank. ''Well, my 
losses are my own affair." Then his eyes came back. 
"Did she tell you I didn't like her ?" 

The indulgence in Mrs. Brook's view of his simplicity 
was marked. " You thought you succeeded so in hiding 
it ? No matter — she bears up. I think she really feels 
a great deal as I do — that it's no matter how many of us 
you hate if you'll only go on feeling as you do about 
mamma. To show us that — that's what we want." 

Nothing could have expressed more the balm of reas- 
surance, but the mild drops fell short of the spot to 
which they were directed. " ' Show ' you ?" 

Oh, how he had sounded the word! "I see — you 
don't show. That's just what Nanda saw you thought ! 
But you can't keep us from knowing it — can't keep it in 
fact, I think, from affecting your own behavior. You'd 
be much worse to us if it wasn't for the still warm ashes 
of your old passion." It was an immense pity that Van- 
derbank was at this moment too far off to fit, for his 





 

amusement, to the expression of his old friend's face so 
much of the cause of it as had sprung from the deeply 
informed tone of Mrs. Brook's allusion. To what degree 
the speaker herself made the connection will never be 
known to history, nor whether, as she went on, she 
thought she bettered her case or simply lost her head. 
'  The great thing for us is that we can never be for you 
quite like other ordinary people." 

'' And what's the great thing for mef 

 '' Oh, for you, there is nothing, I'm afraid, but small 
things — so small that they can scarcely be worth the 
trouble of your making them out. Our being so happy 
that you've come back to us — if only just for a glimpse 
and to leave us again, in no matter what horror, forever ; 
our positive delight in your being exactly so different; 
the pleasure we have in talking about you, and shall still 
have — or indeed all the more — even if we've seen you 
only to lose you : whatever all this represents for our- 
selves, it's for none of us to pretend to say how much or 
how little you may pick out of it. And yet," Mrs. Brook 
wandered on,   ' however much we may disappoint you, 
some little spark of the past can't help being in us — for 
the past is the one thing beyond all spoiling : there it is, 
don't you think ? — to speak for itself and, if need be, 
only of itself." She stopped a moment, but she appeared 
to have destroyed all power of speech in him, so that 
while she waited she had time for a fresh inspiration. 
It might perhaps frankly have been mentioned as on 
the whole her finest.  '' Don't you think it possible 
that if you once get the point of view of realizing that I 
know — ?" 

She held the note so long that he at last supplied a 
sound. '  That you know what ?" 

"Why, that, compared with her, I'm a poor creeping 
thing. I mean " — she hastened to forestall any protest of 
mere decency that would spoil her idea — ''that of course 





  

I ache in every limb with tlie certainty of my dreadful 
difference. It isn't as if I didnH know it, don't you see ? 
There it is, as a matter of course : Tve helplessly, but 
finally and completely, accepted it. Won't that help 
you T' she so ingeniously pleaded.  ' It isn't as if I tor- 
mented you with any recall of her whatever. I can 
quite see how awful it would be for you if, with the 
effect I produce on you, I did have her lovely eyes or her 
distinguished nose or the shape of her forehead or the 
color of her hair. Strange as it is in a daughter, I'm dis- 
connected altogether, and don't you think I may be a lit- 
tle saved for you by becoming thus simply out of the 
question ? Of course," she continued, ' your real trial is 
poor Nanda — she's likewise so fearfully out of it, and yet 
she's so fearfully in it. And she," said Mrs. Brook won- 
derfully — "she doesn't know !" 

A strange faint flush, while she talked, had come into 
Mr. Longdon's face, and, whatever effect, as she put it, 
she produced on him, it was clearly not that of causing 
his attention to wander. She held him at least, for weal 
or woe ; his bright eyes grew brighter and opened into a 
stare that finally seemed to offer him as submerged in 
mere wonder. At last, however, he rose to the surface, 
and he appeared to have lighted, at the bottom of the 
sea, on the pearl of the particular wisdom he needed. 
" I dare say there may be something in what you so ex- 
traordinarily suggest." 

She jumped at it as if in pleasant pain. "In just let- 
ting me go — ?" 

But at this he dropped. "I shall never let you go." 
It renewed her fear. ''Not just for what I am?" 
He rose from his place beside her, but looking away 
from her and with his color marked. "I shall never let 
you go," he repeated. 

'' Oh, you angel !" She sprang up more quickly, and 
the others were by this time on their feet. "I've done 





 

it, I've done it V she joyously cried to Vanderbank ; ''he 
likes me, or at least he can bear me — I've found him the 
way ; and now I don't care even if he says I haven't." 
Then she turned again to her old friend. '' We can man- 
age about Nanda — you needn't ever see her. She's 'down  ' 
now, but she can go up again. We can arrange it at any 
rate — c'est la moindre des choses.'' 

"Upon my honor I protest," Mr. Cashmore exclaimed, 
"against anything of the sort ! I defy you to 'arrange' 
that young lady in any such manner without also arrang- 
ing ?)ie. I'm one of her greatest admirers," he gaily 
announced to Mr. Longdon. 

Vanderbank said nothing, and Mr. Longdon seemed to 
show that he would have preferred to do the same : the 
old man's eyes might have represented an appeal to him 
somehow to intervene, to show the due acquaintance, 
springing from practice and wanting in himself, with the 
art of conversation developed to the point at which it 
could thus sustain a lady in the upper air. Vanderbank's 
silence might, without his mere kind, amused look, have 
seemed almost inhuman. Poor Mr. Longdon had finally 
to do his own simple best. " Will you bring your daugh- 
ter to see me ?" he asked of Mrs. Brookenham. 

" Oh, oh — that's an idea : will you bring her to see 
me f Mr. Cashmore again broke out. 

Mrs. Brook had only fixed Mr. Longdon with the air 
of unutterable things. '' You angel, you angel !"— they 
found expression but in that. 

" / don't need to ask you to bring her, do I ?" Vander- 
bank now said to his hostess. " I hope you don't mind 
my bragging all over the place of the great honor she did 
me the other day in appearing quite by herself." 

" Quite by herself ? I say, Mrs. Brook !" Mr. Cashmore 
stupidly went on. 

It was only now that she noticed him ; which she did 
indeed but by answering Vanderbank. " She didn't go 





  

for you, I'm afraid — though of course she might : she 
went because you had promised her Mr. Longdon. But 
I should have no more feeling about her going to you — 
and should expect her to have no more — than about her 
taking a pound of tea, as she sometimes does, to her old 
nurse, or her going to read to the old women at the work- 
house. May you never have less to brag of !" 

''I wish she'd bring me a pound of tea!" Mr. Cash- 
more resumed. " Or ain't I enough of an old woman for 
her to come and read to me at home ?" 

" Does she habitually visit the workhouse ?" Mr. Long- 
don inquired of Mrs. Brook. 

This lady kept him in a moment's suspense, which an- 
other pair of eyes might moreover have detected that 
Vanderbank in some degree shared. '  Every Eriday at 
three." 

Vanderbank, with a sudden turn, moved slowly to one 
of the windows, and Mr. Cashmore had a happy remem- 
brance. " Why, this is Friday — she must have gone to- 
day. But does she stay so late ?" 

 '  She was to go afterwards to little Aggie : I'm trying 
so, in spite of difficulties," Mrs. Brook explained, 'Ho 
keep them on together." She addressed herself with a 
new thought to Mr. Longdon. ''You must know little 
Aggie — the niece of the Duchess : I forget if you've met 
the Duchess, but you must know her too — there are so 
many things on which, I'm sure, she'll feel with you. 
Little Aggie's the one," she continued; "you'll delight 
in her ; she ought to have been mamma's grandchild." 

"Dearest lady, how can you pretend, or for a moment 
compare her — ?" Mr. Cashmore broke in. "She says 
nothing to me at all." 

"She says nothing to any one," Mrs. Brook serenely 
replied; "that's just her type and her charm — just, 
above all, her education." Then she appealed to Van- 
derbank. "Won't Mr. Longdon be struck with little 





 

Aggie, and won't he find it interesting to talk about all 
that sort of thing with the Duchess ?" 

Vanderbank came back laughing, but Mr. Longdon 
anticipated his reply. 'MVhat sort of thing do you 
mean ?" 



Oh," said Mrs. Brook,    the whole question, don t you 
know ? of bringing girls forward or not. The question 
of — well, what do you call it ? — their exposure. It's tJie 
question, it appears — the question of the future ; it's aw- 
fully interesting, and the Duchess, at any rate, is great 
on it. Nanda, of course, is exposed,'" Mrs. Brook pur- 
sued — '  fearfully." 

 ''And what on earth is she exposed to?" Mr. Cash- 
more gaily demanded. 

" She's exposed to you, it would seem, my dear fel- 
low !" Vanderbank spoke with a certain discernible im- 
patience not so much of the fact he mentioned as of the 
turn of their talk. 

It might have been in almost compassionate depreca- 
tion of this weak note that Mrs. Brookenham looked at 
him. Her reply to Mr. Cashmere's question, however, 
was uttered at Mr. Longdon. ''She's exposed — it's 
much worse — to me. But Aggie isn't exposed to any- 
thing — never has been and never is to be ; and we're 
watching to see if the Duchess can carry it through." 

"Why not," asked Mr. Cashmore, "if there's nothing 
she can be exposed to but the Duchess herself ?" 

He had appealed to his companions impartially, but 
Mr. Longdon, whose attention was now all for his host- 
ess, appeared unconscious. " If you're all watching, is 
it your idea that I should watch ivifh you ?" 

The inquiry, on his lips, was a waft of cold air, the 
sense of which clearly led Mrs. Brook to put her invita- 
tion on the right ground. " Not, of course, on the chance 
of anything's happening to the dear child — to whom noth- 
ing, obviously, can happen but that her aunt will mar- 


  

ry her oS in the shortest possible time and in the best 
possible conditions. 'No, the interest is, much more, in 
the way the Duchess herself steers." 

   Ah, she's in a boat," Mr. Oashmore fully concurred, 
 '' that will take a good bit of that !" 

It is not for Mr. Longdon's historian to overlook that 
if he was not unnaturally mystified, he was yet also visi- 
bly interested. " What boat is she in ?"  

He had addressed his curiosity, with politeness, to Mr. 
Oashmore, but they were all arrested by the wonderful 
way in which Mrs. Brook managed to smile at once very 
dimly, very darkly, and yet make it take them all in. 
 ' I think you must tell him, Van." 

"Heaven forbid !" — and Vanderbank turned away. 

 '' I'll tell him like a shot — if you really give me leave," 
said Mr. Oashmore, for whom any scruple referred itself 
manifestly not to the subject of the information, but to 
the presence of a lady. 

" I don't give you leave, and I beg you U hold your 
tongue," Mrs. Brookenham replied. " You handle such 
matters with a minuteness — ! In short," she broke off 
to Mr. Longdon,  '' he would tell you a good deal more 
than you'll care to know. She is in a boat — but she's an 
experienced mariner. Basta, as she would say. Do you 
know Mitchy ?" Mrs. Brook suddenly asked. 

" Oh yes, he knows Mitchy " — Vanderbank had ap- 
proached again. 

"Then make din tell him" — she put it before the 
young man as a charming turn for them all. " Mitchy 
can be refined when he tries." 

"Oh dear — when Mitchy dries' !" Vanderbank laugh- 
ed. "I think I should rather, for the job, offer him 
to Mr. Longdon as abandoned to his native wild im- 
pulse." 

"I like Mr. Mitchett," the old man said, endeavoring 
to look his hostess straight in the eye, and speaking as if 





 

somewhat to defy her to convict him, even from the 
point of view of Beccles, of a mistake. 

Mrs. Brookcnham took it with a wonderful bright emo- 
tion. "My dear friend, vous me rendez la vie! If you 
can stand Mitchy you can stand any of us !" 

"Upon my honor, I should think so !" Mr. Cashmore 
was eager to remark. "What on earth do you mean," 
he demanded of Mrs. Brook, "by saying that I'm more 
  minute   than he ?" 

She turned her beauty an instant on this visitor. "I 
don t say you're more minute — I say he's more brilliant. 
Besides, as Fve told you before, you're not one of us." 
With which, as a check to further discussion, she went 
straight on to Mr. Longdon : " The point about Aggie's 
conservative education is the wonderful sincerity Avith 
which the Duchess feels that one's girl may so perfectly 
and consistently be hedged in without one's really ever 
(for it comes to that,) depriving one's own self — " 

"Well, of what ?" Mr. Longdon boldly demanded while 
his hostess appeared thoughtfully to falter. 

She addressed herself mutely to Vanderbank, in whom 
the movement produced a laugh. " I defy you," he ex- 
claimed, "to say !" 

"Well, you don't defy me/" Mr. Cashmore cried as 
Mrs. Brook failed to take up the challenge. "If you 
know Mitchy," he went on to Mr. Longdon, " you must 
know Petherton." 

The old man remained vague and not imperceptibly 
cold. " Petherton ?" 

" My brother-in-law — whom, God knows why, Mitchy 
runs." 

"Runs ?" Mr. Longdon again echoed. 

Mrs. Brook appealed afresh to Vanderbank. " I think 
we ought to spare him. I may not remind you of mam- 
ma," she continued to their companion, " but I hope you 
don't mind my saying how much you remind me. Ex- 





  

planations, after all, spoil things, and if you can make 
anything of ns, and will sometimes come back, you'll find 
everything in its native freshness. You'll see, you'll feel 
for yourself." 

Mr. Longdon stood before her and raised to Vander- 
bank, when she had ceased, the eyes he had attached to 
the carpet while she talked. '' And must I go now ?" 
Explanations, she had said, spoiled things, but he might 
have been a stranger at an Eastern court, comically help- 
less without his interpreter. 

 '' If Mrs. Bi\)ok desires to ' spare ' you," Vanderbank 
kindly replied, "the best way to make sure of it would 
perhaps indeed be to remove you. But hadn't we a hope 
of Nanda ?" 

''It might be of use for us to wait for her ?" — it was 
still to his young friend that Mr. Longdon put it. 

''Ah, when she's once on the loose — !" Mrs. Brook- 
enham sighed. "Unless la voild/' she said the next 
moment, as a hand was heard at the door-latch. It was 
only, however, a footman who entered with a little tray 
that, on his approaching his mistress, offered to sight the 
brown envelope of a telegram. She immediately took 
leave to open this missive, after the quick perusal of 
which she had another vision of them all. " It is she — 
the modern daughter. ' Tishy keeps me dinner and 
opera ; clothes all right ; return uncertain, but if before 
morning have latch-key.' She won't come home till morn- 
ing !" said Mrs. Brook. 

" But think of the comfort of the latch-key !" Vander- 
bank laughed. " You might go to the opera," he said to 
Mr. Longdon. 

" Hanged if I don't !" Mr. Cashmore exclaimed. 

Mr. Longdon appeared to have caught from Nanda's 
message an obscure agitation ; he met his young friend's 
suggestion, at all events, with visible intensity. " Will 
you go with me ?" 





 

Vanderbank had jnst hesitated, recalling engagements ; 
which gave Mrs. Brook time to intervene. '' Can't you 
live without him T' she asked of her elder friend. 

Vanderbank had looked at her an instant. " I think I 
can get there late," he then replied to Mr. Longdon. 

 ' I think / can get there early/' Mr. Cashmore de- 
clared. " Mrs. Grendon must have a box ; in fact I 
know which, and they don't," he jocosely continued to 
his hostess. 

Mrs. Brook, meanwhile, had given Mr. Longdon her 
hand. " Well, at any rate, the child shall soon come to 
you. And oh, alone," she insisted ; "you needn't make 
phrases — I know too well what I'm about." 

" One hopes really you do," pursued the unquenched 
Mr. Cashmore. "If that's what one gets by having 
known your mother !" 

" It wouldn't have helped you," Mrs. Brook retorted. 
" And won't you have to say it's all you Avere to get ?" 
she pityingly murmured to her other visitor. 

He turned to Vanderbank with a strange gasp, and 
Vanderbank said " Come !" 





XVI 

The lower windows of the great white house, which 
stood high and square, opened to a wide flagged terrace, 
the parapet of which, an old balustrade of stone, was 
broken in the middle of its course by a flight of stone 
steps that descended to a wonderful garden. The ter- 
race had the afternoon shade and fairly hung over the 
prospect that dropped away and circled it — the prospect, 
beyond the series of gardens, of scattered, splendid trees 
and green glades, an horizon mainly of woods. Nanda 
Brookenham, one day at the end of July, coming out to 
find the place unoccupied as yet by other visitors, stood 
there awhile with an air of happy possession. She moved 
from end to end of the terrace, pausing, gazing about her, 
taking in with a face that showed the pleasure of a brief 
independence the combination of delightful things — of 
old rooms, with old decorations that gleamed and gloomed 
through the high windows, of old gardens that squared 
themselves in the wide angles of old walls, of wood-walks 
rustling in the afternoon breeze and stretching away to 
further reaches of solitude and summer. The scene had 
an expectant stillness that she was too charmed to desire 
to break ; she watched it, listened to it, followed with her 
eyes the white butterflies among the flowers below her, 
then gave a start as the cry of a peacock came to her 





  

from an unseen alley. It set her, after a minute, into 
less difficult motion ; she passed slowly down the steps, 
wandering further, looking back at the big bright house, 
but pleased again to see no one else appear. If the sun 
was still high enough she had a pink parasol. She went 
through the gardens one by one, skirting the high walls 
that were so like '  collections '' and thinking how, later 
on, the nectarines and plums would flush there. She ex- 
changed a friendly greeting with a man at work, passed 
through an open door and, turning this way and that, 
finally found herself, in the park, at some distance from 
the house. It was a point she had had to take another 
rise to reach, a place marked by an old green bench for 
a larger sweep of the view, which, in the distance, where 
the woods stopped, showed, in the most English way in 
the world, the color-spot of an old red village and the 
tower of an old gray church. She had sunk down upon 
the bench almost with a sense of adventure, yet not too 
fluttered to wonder if it wouldn't have been happy to 
bring a book ; the charm of which, precisely, would have 
been in feeling everything about her too beautiful to let 
her read. 

The sense of adventure grew in her, presently becom- 
ing aware of a stir in the thicket below, followed by the 
coming into sight, on a path that, mounting, passed near 
her seat, of a wanderer whom, had his particular, his ex- 
ceptional identity not quickly appeared, it might have 
disappointed her a trifle to have to recognize as a friend. 
He saw her immediately, stopped, laughed, waved his 
hat, then bounded up the slope and, brushing his fore- 
head with his handkerchief, confessing to being hot, was 
rejoicingly there before her. Her own ejaculation on 
first seeing him —    Why, Mr. Van !" — had had an ambig-

Vanderbank wondered and laughed.  ' It will come to 
me. But it's a charming sign of London relations, isn't 
it? — that one can come down to people this way, and 
be awfully well ' done for' and all that, and then go away 
and lose the whole thing, quite forget to whom one has 
been beholden. It's a queer life." 

Nanda seemed for an instant to wish to say that one 
might deny the queerness, but she said something else in- 
stead. " I suppose a man like you doesn't quite feel that 
he is beholden : it's awfully good of him — it's doing a 
great deal for anybody — that he should come down at 
all ; so that it would add immensely to his burden if any- 
body had to be remembered for it."
