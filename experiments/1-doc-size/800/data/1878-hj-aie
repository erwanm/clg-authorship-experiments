asked his lordship. " You don 't believe I'm a 
humbug, eh ?" 

"No," said Bessie, "I don 't." 

" You are too tall to stand up, Lord Lambeth," 
Mrs. Westgate observed. " You are only tolerable 
when you sit down. Be so good as to get a chair." 

He found a chair and placed it sidewise, close 
to the two ladies. "If I hadn 't met Woodley I 
should never have found you," he went on. 
"Should I, Woodley?" 

" Well, I guess not," said the young American. 

" Not even with my letter ?" asked Mrs. West- 
gate. 

" Ah, well, I haven 't got your letter yet ; I suppose I shall get it this evening. It was awfully 
kind of you to write." 

" So I said to Bessie," observed Mrs. Westgate. 

" Did she say so, Miss Alden ?" Lord Lambeth 
inquired. "I dare say you have been here a 
month." 

" We have been here three," said Mrs. West- 
gate. 





" Have you been here three months ?" the young 
man asked again of Bessie. 

" It seems a long time," Bessie answered. 

" I say, after that you had better not call me a 
humbug!" cried Lord Lambeth. "I have only 
been in town three weeks ; but you must have 
been hiding away ; I haven 't seen you any where." 

" Where should you have seen us where should 
we have gone ?" asked Mrs. Westgate. 

"You should have gone to Hurlingham," said 
Willie Woodley. 

" No ; let Lord Lambeth tell us," Mrs. Westgate 
insisted. 

" There are plenty of places to go to," said Lord 
Lambeth ; " each one stupider than the other. I 
mean people 's houses ; they send you cards." 

" No one has sent us cards," said Bessie. 

" We are very quiet," her sister declared. " We 
are here as travellers." 

" We have been to Madame Tussaud s," Bessio 
pursued. 

" Oh, I say !" cried Lord Lambeth. 

" We thought we should find your image there," 
said Mrs. Westgate " yours and Mr. Beaumont's." 

" In the Chamber of Horrors ?" laughed tho 
young man. 

" It did duty very well for a party," said Mrs. 
Westgate. " All the women were decolletecs, and 



  

many of the figures looked as if they could speak 
if they tried." 

" Upon my word," Lord Lambeth rejoined, " you 
see people at London parties that look as if they 
couldn 't speak if they tried." 

" Do you think Mr. Woodley could find us Mr. 
Beaumont ?" asked Mrs. Westgate. 

Lord Lambeth stared and looked round him. 
" I dare say he could. Beaumont often comes here. 
Don 't you think you could find him, Woodley ? 
Make a dive into the crowd." 

" Thank you ; I have had enough diving," said 
Willie Woodley. " I will wait till Mr. Beaumont 
comes to the surface." 

" I will bring him to see you," said Lord Lam 
beth ; " where are you staying ?" 

" You will find the address in my letter Jones 's 
Hotel." 

"Oh, one of those places just out of Picca 
dilly ? Beastly hole, isn't it ?" Lord Lambeth in 
quired. 

"I believe it 's the best hotel in London," said 
Mrs. Westgate. 

"But they give you awful rubbish to eat, don 't 
they ?" his lordship went on. 

" Yes," said Mrs. Westgate. 

" I always feel so sorry for the people that come 
up to town and go to live in those places," continned the young man. " They eat nothing but 
filth." 

" Oh, I say !" cried Willie Woodley. 
" Well, how do you like London, Miss Alden ?" 
Lord Lambeth asked, unperturbed by this ejaculation. 

" I think it 's grand," said Bessie Alden. 
"My sister likes it, in spite of the filth ! " Mrs. 
Westgate exclaimed. 

" I hope you are going to stay a long time." 
"As long as I can," said Bessie. 
"And where is Mr. Westgate ?" asked Lord 
Lambeth of this gentleman 's wife. 

" He 's where he always is in that tiresome Xew 
York." 

"He must be tremendously clever," said the 
young man. 

" I suppose he is," said Mrs. Westgate. 
Lord Lambeth sat for nearly an hour with his 
American friends ; but it is not our purpose to relate their conversation in full. He addressed a 
great many remarks to Bessie Alden, and finally 
turned toward her altogether, while Willie Woodley entertained Mrs. Westgate. Bessie herself said - 
very little ; she was on her guard, thinking of what 
her sister had said to her at lunch. Little by little, 
however, she interested herself in Lord Lambeth 
again, as she had done at Newport ; only it seem- 



  

ed to her that here he might become more interesting. He would be an unconscious part of the 
antiquity, the impressiveness, the picturesqueness, 
of England ; and poor Bessie Alden, like many 
a Yankee maiden, was terribly at the mercy of 
picturesqueness. 

" I have often wished I were at Newport again," 
said the young man. "Those days I spent at 
your sister 's were awfully jolly." 

" We enjoyed them very much ; I hope your 
father is better." 

" Oh dear, yes. When I got to England, he 
was out grouse-shooting. It was what you call in 
America a gigantic fraud. My mother had got 
nervous. My three weeks at Newport seemed like 
a happy dream." 

" America certainly is very different from England," said Bessie. 

"I hope you like England better, eh?" Lord 
Lambeth rejoined, almost persuasively. 

"No Englishman can ask that seriously of a 
person of another country." 

Her companion looked at her for a moment. 
" You mean it 's a matter of course ?" 

" If I were English," said Bessie, " it would cer 
tainly seem to me a matter of course that every 
one should be a good patriot." 

" Oh dear, yes, patriotism is every thing," said 





Lord Lambeth, not quite following, but very contented. " Now, what are you going to do here ?" 

" On Thursday I am going to the Tower." 

"The Tower?" 

" The Tower of London. Did you never hear 
of it?" 

" Oh yes, I have been there," said Lord Lam 
beth. "I was taken there by my governess when 
I was six years old. It 's a rum idea, your going 
there." 

" Do give me a few more rum ideas," said Bessie. " I want to see every thing of that sort. I 
am going to Hampton Court, and to Windsor, and 
to the Dulwich Gallery." 

Lord Lambeth seemed greatly amused. "I 
wonder you don 't go to the Rosherville Gardens." 

" Are they interesting ?" asked Bessie. 

" Oh, wonderful." 

"Are they very old? That 's all I care for," 
said Bessie. 

" They are tremendously old ; they are all falling 
to ruins." 

" I think there is nothing so charming as an old 
ruinous garden," said the young girl. " We must 
certainly go there." 

Lord Lambeth broke out into merriment. " I 
say, Woodley," he cried, " here 's Miss Alden wants 
to go to the Rosherville Gardens !" 



  

Willie Woodley looked a little blank ; he was 
caught in the fact of ignorance of an apparently 
conspicuous feature of London life. But in a 
moment he turned it off. " Very well," he said, 
" I'll write for a permit." 

Lord Lambeth 's exhilaration increased. " Gad, 
I believe you Americans would go any where !" ho 
cned. 

" We wish to go to Parliament," said Bessie. 
" That 's one of the first things." 

u Oh, it would bore you to death !" cried the 
young man. 

"We wish to hear you speak." 

"I never speak except to young ladies," said 
Lord Lambeth, smiling. 

Bessie Alden looked at him a while, smiling, too, 
in the shadow of her parasol. "You are very 
strange," she murmured. " I don 't think I ap 
prove of you." 

"Ah, now, don 't be severe, Miss Alden," said 
Lord Lambeth, smiling still more. " Please don 't 
be severe. I want you to like me awfully." 

" To like you awfully ? You must not laugh 
at me, then, when I make mistakes. I consider 
it my right as a free-born American to make 
as many mistakes as I choose." 

 Upon my word, I didn 't laugh at you," said 
Lord Lambeth. 





" And not only that," Bessie went on ; "but I 
hold that all my mistakes shall be set down to my 
credit. You must think the better of me for them." 

"I can 't think better of you than I do," the 
young man declared. 

Bessie Alden looked at him a moment again. 
" You certainly speak very well to young ladies. 
But why don 't you address the House ? isn't that 
what they call it ?" 

"Because I have nothing to say," said Lord Lambeth. 

" Haven't you a great position ?" asked Bessie 
Alden. 

He looked a moment at the back of his glove. 
" I'll set that down," he said, " as one of your mistakes to your credit." And as if he disliked 
talking about his position, he changed the subject. 
" I wish you would let me go with you to the Tower, and to Hampton Court, and to all those other 
places." 

" We shall be most happy," said Bessie. 

" And of course I shall be delighted to show 
you the House of Lords some day that suits you. 
There are a lot of things I want to do for you. I 
want to make you have a good time. And I should 
like very much to present some of my friends to 
you, if it wouldn 't bore you. Then it would be 
awfully kind of you to come down to Branches." 



  

" We are much obliged to you, Lord Lambeth," 
said Bessie. " What is Branches ?" 

" It 's a house in the country. I think you might 
like it." 

Willie Woodley and Mrs. Westgate at this mo 
ment were sitting in silence, and the young man 's 
ear caught these last words of Lord Lambeth's. 
"He 's inviting Miss Bessie to one of his castles," 
he murmured to his companion. 

Mrs. Westgate, foreseeing what she mentally 
called " complications," immediately got up ; and 
the two ladies, taking leave of Lord Lambeth, returned, under Mr. Woodley 's conduct, to Jones 's 
Hotel. 

Lord Lambeth came to see them on the morrow, 
bringing Percy Beaumont with him the latter 
having instantly declared his intention of neglecting none of the usual offices of civility. This declaration, however, when his kinsman informed him 
of the advent of their American friends, had been 
preceded by another remark. 

" Here they are, then, and you are in for it." 

" What am I in for ?" demanded Lord Lambeth. 

" I will let your mother give it a name. With 
all respect to whom," added Percy Beaumont, " I 
must decline on this occasion to do any more police duty. Her Grace must look after you her 
self." 



" I will give her a chance," said her Grace 
a trifle grimly. " I shall make her go and see 
them." 

" She won 't do it, my boy." 

" We'll see if she doesn 't," said Lord Lambeth. 

But if Percy Beaumont took a sombre view of 
the arrival of the two ladies at Jones 's Hotel, he 
was sufficiently a man of the world to offer them 
a smiling countenance. He fell into animated 
conversation conversation, at least, that was an 
imated on her side with Mrs. Westgate, while 
his companion made himself agreeable to the 
younger lady . Mrs. Westgate began confessing 
and protesting, declaring and expounding. 

"I must say London is a great deal brighter 
and prettier just now than it was when I was here 
last in the month of November. There is evidently a great deal going on, and you seem to have 
a good many flowers. I have no doubt it is very 
charming for all you people, and that you amuse 
yourselves immensely. It is very good of you to 
let Bessie and me come and sit and look at you. 
I suppose you will think I am very satirical, but 
I must confess that that 's the feeling I have in 
London." 

" I am afraid I don 't quite understand to what 
feeling you allude," said Percy Beaumont. 

" The feeling that it 's all very well for you English people. Every thing is beautifully arranged 
for you." 

" It seems to me it is very well for some Americans, sometimes," rejoined Beaumont. 

"For some of them, yes if they like to be patronized. But I must say I don 't like to be patronized. I may be very eccentric, and undisci 
plined, and outrageous, but I confess I never was 
fond of patronage. I like to associate with people on the same terms as I do in my own country ; 
that 's a peculiar taste that I have. But here people seem to expect something else Heaven knows 
what ! I am afraid you will think I am very un 
grateful, for I certainly have received a great deal 
of attention. The last time I was here, a lady 
sent me a message that I was at liberty to come 
and see her." 

" Dear me ! I hope you didn 't go," observed Percy Beaumont. 

" You are deliciously naif, I must say that for 
you !" Mrs. Westgate exclaimed. " It must be a 
great advantage to you here in London. I suppose 
that if I myself had a little more naivete, I should 
enjoy it more. I should be content to sit on a 
chair in the park, and see the people pass, and be 
told that this is the Duchess of Suffolk, and that 
is the Lord Chamberlain, and that I must be thankful for the privilege of beholding them. I dare 





say it is very wicked and critical of me to ask for 
any thing else. But I was always critical, and I 
freely confess to the sin of being fastidious. I am 
told there is some remarkably superior second-rate 
society provided here for strangers. Herd! I don 't want any superior second-rate society. I 
want the society that I have been accustomed to." 

" I hope you don 't call Lambeth and me secondrate," Beaumont interposed. 

" Oh, I am accustomed to you," said Mrs. Westgate. " Do you know that you English sometimes 
make the most wonderful speeches? The first 
time I came to London I went out to dine as I 
told you, I have received a great deal of attention. 
After dinner, in the drawing-room, I had some 
conversation with an old lady : I assure you I had. 
I forget what we talked about, but she presently 
said, in allusion to something we were discussing 
Oh, you know, the aristocracy do so-and-so ; but 
in one 's own class of life it is very different. In 
one 's own class of life ! What is a poor unpro 
tected American woman to do in a country where 
she is liable to have that sort of thing said to 
her?" 

" You seem to get hold of some very queer old 
ladies ; I compliment you on your acquaintance !" 
Percy Beaumont exclaimed. " If you are trying 
to bring me to admit that London is an odious 



place, you'll not succeed." 

" Pour vous aidres. I never satirical contrary," 
Mrs. Westgate retorted. I make use of this expression, because both interlocutors had begun to 
raise their voices. Percy Beaumont naturally did 
not like to hear his country abused, and Mrs. Westgate, no less naturally, did not like a stubborn debater. 

" Hallo !" said Lord Lambeth ; lt what are they 
up to now ?" And he came away from the window, 
where he had been standing with Bessie Alden. 

" I quite agree with a very clever country-woman 
of mine," Mrs. Westgate continued, with charming ardor, though with imperfect relevancy. She 
smiled at the two gentlemen for a moment with 
terrible brightness, as if to toss at their feet 
upon their native heath the gauntlet of defiance. 
" For me, there are only two social positions worth 
speaking of that of an American lady, and that 
of the Emperor of Russia." 

"And what do you do with the American gen 
tlemen ?" asked Lord Lambeth. 

" She leaves them in America !" said Percy 
Beaumont. 

On the departure of their visitors, Bessie Alden 
told her sister that Lord Lambeth would come the 
next day, to go with them to the Tower, and that 



he had got; kindly offered to bring bis "trap," and 
 Mrs. Vestgate listened in 
silence to lria pdmmimicafcidn, and for some time 
afterward she said nothing. But at last, " If you 
had not requested me the other day not to mention 
it," she began, " there is something I should venture to ask you." Bessie frowned a little ; her 
dark blue eyes were more dark than blue. But 
her sister went on. " As it is, I will take the risk. 
You are not in love with Lord Lambeth : I believe 
it, perfectly. Very good. But is there, by chance, 
any danger of your becoming so ? It 's a very simple question ; don 't take offense. I have a particular reason," said Mrs. Westgate, " for wanting 
to know." 

Bessie Alden for some moments said nothing ; 
she only looked displeased. " IS T o ; there is no 
danger," she answered at last, curtly. 

"Then I should like to frighten them," declared Mrs. Westgate, clasping her jewelled hands. 

" To frighten whom ?" 

"All these people; Lord Lambeth 's family 
and friends." 

" How should you frighten them ?" asked the 
young girl. 

" It wouldn 't be I it would be you. It would 
frighten them to think that you should absorb 
his lordship 's young affections." 



  

Bessie Alden, with her clear eyes still over 
shadowed by her dark brows, continued to interrogate. " Why should that frighten them ?" 

Mrs. West-gate poised her answer with a smile 
before delivering it. "Because they think you 
are not good enough. You are a charming girl, 
beautiful and amiable, intelligent and clever, and 
as bien-elevee as it is possible to be; but you are 
not a fit match for Lord Lambeth." 

Bessie Alden was decidedly disgusted. " Where 
do you get such extraordinary ideas ?" she asked. 
" You have said some such strange things lately. 
My dear Kitty, where do you collect them ?" 

Kitty was evidently enamored of her idea. 
"Yes, it would put them on pins and needles, 
and it wouldn 't hurt you. Mr. Beaumont is already most uneasy ; I could soon see that." 

The young girl meditated a moment. "Do 
you mean that they spy upon him that they in 
terfere with him ?" 

" I don 't know what power they have to interfere, but I know that a British mamma may worry her son 's life out." 

It has been intimated that, as regards certain 
disagreeable things, Bessie Alden had a fund of 
skepticism. She abstained on the present occasion from expressing disbelief, for she wished 
not to irritate her sister. But she said to herself that Kitty had been misinformed that this 
was a traveller 's tale. Though she was a girl of 
a lively imagination, there could in the nature of 
things be, to her sense, no reality in the idea of 
her belonging to a vulgar category. What she 
said aloud was, " I must say that in that case I 
am very sorry for Lord Lambeth." 

Mrs. Westgate, more and more exhilarated by 
her scheme, was smiling at her again. "If I 
could only believe it was safe !" she exclaimed. 
"When you begin to pity him, I, on my side, am 
afraid." 

" Afraid of what ?" 

" Of your pitying him too much." 

Bessie Alden turned away impatiently; but at 
the end of a minute she turned back. " What if 
I should pity him too much ?" she asked. 

Mrs. Westgate hereupon turned away, but after a moment 's reflection she also faced her sister 
again. " It would come, after all, to the same 
thing," she said. 

Lord Lambeth came the next day with his 
trap, and the two ladies, attended by Willie 
Woodley, placed themselves under his guidance, 
and were conveyed eastward, through some of 
the duskier portions of the metropolis, to the 
great turreted donjon which overlooks the London shipping. They all descended from their 



  

vehicle and entered the famous inclosure; and 
they secured the services of a venerable beef-eat 
er, who, though there were many other claimants 
for legendary information, made a fine exclusive 
party of them and marched them through courts 
and corridors, through armories and prisons. He 
delivered his usual peripatetic discourse, and they 
stopped and stared, and peeped and stooped, according to the official admonitions. Bessie Alden 
asked the old man in the crimson doublet a great 
many questions ; she thought it a most fascina 
ting place. Lord Lambeth was in high good 
humor ; he was constantly laughing ; he enjoyed 
what he would have called the lark. Willie 
Woodley kept looking at the ceilings and tapping the walls with the knuckle of a pearl-gray 
glove ; and Mrs. Westgate, asking at frequent in 
tervals to be allowed to sit down and wait till 
they came back, was as frequently informed that 
they would never come back. To a great many 
of Bessie 's questions chiefly on collateral points 
of English history the ancient warder was naturally unable to reply; whereupon she always 
appealed to Lord Lambeth. But his lordship 
was very ignorant. He declared that he knew 
nothing about that sort of thing, and he seemed 
greatly diverted at being treated as an authority. 





" You can 't expect every one to know as much 
as you," he said. 

"I should expect you to know a great deal 
more," declared Bessie Alden. 

" Women always know more than men about 
names and dates, and that sort of thing," Lord 
Lambeth rejoined. " There was Lady Jane Grey 
we have just been hearing about, who went in 
for Latin and Greek, and all the learning of her 
age." 

" You have no right to be ignorant, at all 
events," said Bessie. 

" Why haven 't I as good a right as any one 
else?" 

"Because you have lived in the midst of all 
these things." 

"What things do you mean? Axes, and 
blocks, and thumb-screws ?" 

" All these historical things. You belong to 
a historical family." 

"Bessie is really too historical," said Mrs. 
Westgate, catching a word of this dialogue. 

"Yes, you are too historical," said Lord Lambeth, laughing, but thankful for a formula. 
"Upon my honor, you are too historical !" 

He went with the ladies a couple of days later 
to Hampton Court, Willie Woodley being also of 
the party. The afternoon was charming, the famous horse-chestnuts were in blossom, and Lord 
Lambeth, who quite entered into the spirit of the 
cockney excursionist, declared that it was a jolly 
old place. Bessie Alden was in ecstasies ; she 
went about murmuring and exclaiming. 

" It 's too lovely," said the young girl ; " it 's too 
enchanting ; it 's too exactly what it ought to be !" 

At Hampton Court the little flocks of visitors 
are not provided with an official bell-wether, but 
are left to browse at discretion upon the local 
antiquities. It happened in this manner that, in 
default of another informant, Bessie Alden, who 
on doubtful questions was able to suggest a great 
many alternatives, found herself again applying 
for intellectual assistance to Lord Lambeth. But 
he again assured her that he was utterly help 
less in such matters that his education had been 
sadly neglected. 

"And I am sorry it makes you unhappy," he 
added, in a moment. 

" You are very disappointing, Lord Lambeth," 
she said. 

" Ah, now, don 't say that," he cried. " That 's 
the worst thing you could possibly say." 

" No," she rejoined, u it is not so bad as to say 
that I had expected nothing of you." 

" I don 't know. Give me a notion of the sort 
of thing you expected." 





" Well," said Bessie Alden, " that you would be 
more what I should like to be what I should 
try to be in your place." 

" Ah, my place !" exclaimed Lord Lambeth. 
" You are always talking about my place !" 

The young girl looked at him ; he thought she 
colored a little ; and for a moment she made no 
rejoinder. 

"Does it strike you that I am always talking 
about your place ?" she asked. 

" I am sure you do it a great honor," he said, 
fearing he had been uncivil. 

" I have often thought about it," she went on, 
after a moment. " I have often thought about 
your being a hereditary legislator. A hereditary legislator ought to know a great many 
things." 

" Xot if he doesn 't legislate." 

" But you do legislate ; it 's absurd your saying 
you don 't. You are very much looked up to here 
I am assured of that." 

" I don 't know that I ever noticed it." 

" It is because you are used to it, then. You 
ought to fill the place." 

"How do you mean to fill it?" asked Lord 
Lambeth. 

" You ought to be very clever and brilliant, and 
to know almost every thing." 



  

Lord Lambeth looked at her a moment. 
"Shall I tell you something?" he asked. "A 
young man in my position, as you call it " 

"I didn 't invent the term," interposed Bessie 
Alden. " I have seen it in a great many books." 

" Hang it ! you are always at your books. A 
fellow in my position, then, does very well what 
ever he does. That 's about what I mean to say." 

" Well, if your own people are content with 
you," said Bessie Alden, laughing, " it is not for 
me to complain. But I shall always think that, 
properly, you should have been a great mind a 
great character." 

" Ah, that 's very theoretic," Lord Lambeth declared. " Depend upon it, that 's a Yankee prejudice." 

" Happy the country," said Bessie Alden, 
" where even people 's prejudices are so elevated !" 

" Well, after all," observed Lord Lambeth, " I 
don 't know that I am such a fool as you are trying to make me out." 

" I said nothing so rude as that ; but I must 
repeat that you are disappointing." 

" My dear Miss Alden," exclaimed the young 
man, " I am the best fellow in the world !" 

" Ah, if it were not for that !" said Bessie 
Alden, with a smile. 

Mrs. Westgate had a good many more friends 





in London 'than she pretended, and before long 
she had renewed acquaintance with most of them. 
Their hospitality was extreme, so that, one thing 
leading to another, she began, as the phrase is, to 
go out. Bessie Alden, in this way, saw some 
thing of what she found it a great satisfaction to 
call to herself English society. She went to balls 
and danced, she went to dinners and talked, she 
went to concerts and listened (at concerts Bessie 
always listened), she went to exhibitions and 
wondered. Her enjoyment was keen and her curiosity insatiable, and, grateful in general for all her 
opportunities, she especially prized the privilege 
of meeting certain celebrated persons authors 
and artists, philosophers and statesmen of 
whose renown she had been a humble and distant 
beholder, and who now, as a part of the habitual 
furniture of London drawing-rooms, struck her 
as stars fallen from the firmament and become 
palpable revealing also sometimes, on contact, 
qualities not to have been predicted of sidereal 
bodies. Bessie, who knew so many of her con 
temporaries by reputation, had a good many per 
sonal disappointments ; but, on the other hand, 
she had innumerable satisfactions and enthusiasms, and she communicated the emotions of 
either class to a dear friend, of her own sex, in 
Boston, with whom she was in voluminous correspondence. Some of her reflections, indeed, she 
attempted to impart to Lord Lambeth, who came 
almost every day to Jones 's Hotel, and whom Mrs. 
Westgate admitted to be really devoted. Captain 
Littledale, it appeared, had gone to India ; and of 
several others of Mrs. Westgate 's ex-pensioners 
gentlemen who, as she said, had made, in New 
York, a club-house of her drawing-room no tid 
ings were to be obtained ; but Lord Lambeth was 
certainly attentive enough to make up for the accidental absences, the short memories, all the other 
irregularities, of every one else. He drove them in
