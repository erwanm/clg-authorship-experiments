that night in the fog, when the Paladin took his horse's 
ears for hostile lances and got off and climbed a tree — ' 

' It's a lie ! a lie without shadow of foundation, and I 
call upon you all to beware how you give credence to the 
malicious inventions of this ramshackle slander-mill that 
has been doing its best to destroy my character for years, 
and will grind up your own reputations for you, next. I 
got off to tighten my saddle-girth — I wish I may die in my 
tracks if it isn't so — and whoever wants to believe it can, 
and whoever don't, can let it alone.' 

' There, that is the way with him, you see ; he never can 
discuss a theme temperately, but always flies off the handle 
and becomes disagreeable. And you notice his defect of 
memory. He remembers getting off his horse, but forgets 
all the rest, even the tree. But that is natural ; he would 
remember getting off the horse because he was so used to 
doing it. He always did it when there was an alarm and 
the clash of arms at the front.' 

' Why did he choose that time for it ? ' asked Jean. 

' I don't know. To tighten up his girth, he thinks ; to 
climb a tree, I think ; I saw him climb nine trees in a single 
night.' 

' You saw nothing of the kind ! A person that can lie 

like that deserves no one's respect. I ask you all to answer 
me. Do you believe what this reptile has said ? ' 

All seemed embarrassed, and only Pierre replied. He 
said, hesitatingly — 

' I — well, I hardly know what to say. It is a delicate 
situation. It seems offensive to refuse to believe a person 
when he makes so direct a statement, and yet I am obliged 
to say, rude as it may appear, that I am not able to believe 
the whole of it — no, I am not able to believe that you climbed 
nine trees.' 

' There ! ' cried the Paladin ; ' now what do you think 
of yourself, Noel Rainguesson ? How many do you believe 
I climbed, Pierre ? ' 

' Only eight.' 

The laughter that followed inflamed the Paladin's anger 
to white heat, and he said — 

' I bide my time — I bide my time. I will reckon with 
you all, I promise you that ! ' 

' Don't get him started,' Noel pleaded ; ' he is a perfect 
lion when he gets started. I saw enough to teach me that, 
after the third skirmish. After it was over I saw him come 
out of the bushes and attack a dead man single-handed.' 

' It is another lie ; and I give you fair warning that you 
are going too far. You will see me attack a live one if 
you are not careful.' 

' Meaning me, of course. This wounds me more than 
any number of injurious and unkind speeches could do. 
Ingratitude to one's benefactor — ' 

' Benefactor ? What do I owe you, I should like to 
know ? ' 

' You owe me your life. I stood between the trees and 
the foe, and kept hundreds and thousands of the enemy 
at bay when they were thirsting for your blood. And I did 
not do it to display my daring, I did it because I loved you 
and could not live without you.' 

' There — you have said enough ! I will not stay here 
to listen to these infamies. I can endure your lies, but not 


your love. Keep that corruption for somebody with a 
stronger stomach than mine. And I want to say this, 
before I go. That you people's small performances might 
appear the better and win you the more glory, I hid my own 
deeds through all the march. I went always to the front, 
where the fighting was thickest, to be remote from you, in 
order that you might not see and be discouraged by the 
things I did to the enemy. It was my purpose to keep this 
a secret in my own breast, but you force me to reveal it. 
If you ask for my witnesses, yonder they lie, on the road 
we have come. I found that road mud, I paved it with 
corpses. I found that country sterile, I fertilised it with 
blood. Time and again I was urged to go to the rear 
because the command could not proceed on account of my 
dead. And yet you, you miscreant, accuse me of climbing 
trees ! Pah ! ' 

And he strode out, with a lofty air, for the recital of his 
imaginary deeds had already set him up again and made 
him feel good. 

Next day we mounted and faced toward Chinon. 
Orleans was at our back, now, and close by, lying in the 
strangling grip of the English ; soon, please God, we 
would face about and go to their relief. From Gien the news 
had spread to Orleans that the peasant Maid of Vaucouleurs 
was on her way, divinely commissioned to raise the siege. 
The news made a great excitement and raised a great hope 
— the first breath of hope those poor souls had breathed in 
five months. They sent commissioners at once to the 
King to beg him to consider this matter, and not throw this 
help lightly away. These commissioners were already at 
Chinon by this time. 

When we were half-way to Chinon we happened upon 
yet one more squad of enemies. They burst suddenly out 
of the woods, and in considerable force, too ; but we were 
not the apprentices we were ten or twelve days before ; no, 
we were seasoned to this kind of adventure now ; our 
hearts did not jump into our throats and our weapons 

tremble in our hands. We had learned to be always in 
battle array, always alert, and always ready to deal with 
any emergency that might turn up. We were no more 
dismayed by the sight of those people than our commander 
was. Before they could form, Joan had delivered the order, 
' Forward ! ' and we were down upon them with a rush. 
They stood no chance ; they turned tail and scattered, we 
ploughing through them as if they had been men of straw. 
That was our last ambuscade, and it was probably laid for 
us by that treacherous rascal the King's own minister and 
favourite, De la Tremouille. 

We housed ourselves in an inn, and soon the town 
came flocking to get a glimpse of the Maid. 

Ah, the tedious King and his tedious people ! Our 
two good knights came presently, their patience well 
wearied, and reported. They and we reverently stood — 
as becomes persons who are in the presence of Kings and 
the superiors of Kings — until Joan, troubled by this mark 
of homage and respect, and not content with it nor yet 
used to it, although we had not permitted ourselves to do 
otherwise since the day she prophesied that wretched 
traitor's death and he was straightway drowned, thus 
confirming many previous signs that she was indeed an 
ambassador commissioned of God, commanded us to sit ; 
then the Sieur de Metz said to Joan : 

' The King has got the letter, but they will not let us 
have speech with him.' 

' Who is it that forbids ? ' 

' None forbids, but there be three or four that are 
nearest his person — schemers and traitors every one — that 
put obstructions in the way, and seek all ways, by lies and 
pretexts, to make delay. Chiefest of these are Georges 
de la Tremouille and that plotting fox the Archbishop of 
Rheims. While they keep the King idle and in bondage 
to his sports and follies, they are great and their importance 
grows ; whereas if ever he assert himself and rise and 
strike for crown and country like a man, their reign is 


done. So they but thrive, they care not if the crown go to 
destruction and the King with it.' 

' You have spoken with others besides these ? ' 
' Not of the Court, no— the Court are the meek slaves 
of those reptiles, and watch their mouths and their actions, 
acting as they act, thinking as they think, saying as they 
say : wherefore they are cold to us, and turn aside and go 
another way when we appear. But we have spoken with 
the commissioners from Orleans. They said with heat : 
'' It is a marvel that any man in such desperate case as is 
the King can moon around in his torpid way, and see his 
all go to ruin without lifting a finger to stay the disaster. 
What a most strange spectacle it is ! Here he is, shut up 
in this wee corner of the realm like a rat in a trap ; his 
royal shelter this huge gloomy tomb of a castle, with 
wormy rags for upholstery and crippled furniture for use, 
a very house of desolation ; in his treasury forty francs' 
and not a farthing more, God be witness ! no army, nor 
any shadow of one; and by contrast with this hungry 
poverty you behold this crownless pauper and his shoals of 
fools and favourites tricked out in the gaudiest silks and 
velvets you shall find in any Court in Christendom. And 
look you, he knows that when our city falls— as fall it 
surely will except succour come swiftly-France falls ; he 
knows that when that day comes he will be an outlaw and 
a fugitive, and that behind him the English flag will float 
unchallenged over every acre of his great heritage ; he 
knows these things, he knows that our faithful city is 
fighting all solitary and alone against disease, starvation 
and the sword to stay this awful calamity, yet he will not 
strike one blow to save her, he will not hear our prayers, 
he will not even look upon our faces." That is what the 
commissioners said, and they are in despair.' 
Joan said, gently — 

' It is a pity, but they must not despair. The Dauphin 
will hear them presently. Tell them so.' 


She almost always called the King the Dauphin. To 
her mind he was not King yet, not being crowned. 

' We will tell them so, and it will content them, for 
they believe you come from God. The Archbishop and his 
confederate have for backer that veteran soldier Raoul de 
Gaucourt, Grand Master of the Palace, a worthy man but 
simply a soldier, with no head for any greater matter. He 
cannot make out to see how a country girl, ignorant of war, 
can take a sword in her small hand and win victories where 
the trained generals of France have looked for defeats 
only, for fifty years — and always found them. And so he 
lifts his frosty moustache and scoffs.' 

' When God fights it is but small matter whether the 
hand that bears His sword is big or little. He will per- 
ceive this in time. Is there none in that Castle of Chinon 
who favours us ? ' 

' Yes, the King's mother-in-law, Yolande, Queen of 
Sicily, who is wise and good. She spoke with the Sieur 
Bertrand.' 

' She favours us, and she hates those others, the King's 
beguilers,' said Bertrand. ' She was full of interest, and 
asked a thousand questions, all of which I answered 
according to my ability. Then she sat thinking over these 
replies until I thought she was lost in a dream and would 
wake no more. But it was not so. At last she said, slowly, 
and as if she were talking to herself: ' A child of seven- 
teen — a girl — country bred — untaught —ignorant of war, 
the use of arms, and the conduct of battles — modest, gentle, 
shrinking — yet throws away her shepherd's crook and 
clothes herself in steel, and fights her way through a 
hundred and fifty leagues of hostile territory, never losing 
heart or hope and never showing fear, and comes — she to 
whom a king must be a dread and awful presence — and 
will stand up before such a one and say. Be not afraid, 
God has sent me to save you ! Ah, whence could come 
a courage and conviction so sublime as this but from 
very God Himself ! ' She was silent again awhile, thinking, 

and making up her mind; then she said, ''And whether 
she comes of God or no, there is that in her heart that 
raises her above men-high above all men that breathe in 
France to-day~for in her is that mysterious something- 
that puts heart into soldiers, and turns mobs of cowards 
mto armies of fighters that forget what fear is when they 
are in that presence-fighters who go into battle with jov 
in their eyes and songs on their lips, and sweep over the 
field like a storm-that is the spirit that can save France 
and that alone, come It whence it may ! It is in her I do 
truly believe, for what else could have borne up that' child 
on that great march, and made her despise Its dangers and 
fatigues ? The King must see her face to face-and shall ' - 
She dismissed me with those good words, and I know her 
promise will be kept. They will delay her all they can- 
those animals— but she will not fail, in the end ' 

' Would she were King ! ' said the other knlg-ht, fer- 
vently. ' For there is little hope that the King himself can 
be stirred out of his lethargy. He is wholly without hope, 
and IS only thinking of throwing away everything and fly- 
ing to some foreign land. The commissioners say there 
IS a spell upon him that makes him hopeless-yes, and that 
it IS shut up in a mystery which they cannot fathom ' 

' I know the mystery,' said Joan, with quiet confidence : 
I know It, and he knows it, but no other but God. When 

I see him I will tell him a secret that will drive away his 
trouble, then he will hold up his head again ' 

I was miserable with curiosity to know what it was 
that she would tell him, but she did not say, and I did not 
expect she would. She was but a child, it is true ; but she 
was not a chatterer to tell great matters and make herself 
important to little people ; no, she was reserved, and kept 
things to herself, as the truly great always do. 

The next day Queen Yolande got one victory over the 
King s keepers, for in spite of their protestations and ob- 
structions she procured an audience for our two knlg-hts 
and they made the most they could out of their opportunity' 

They told the King what a spotless and beautiful character 
Joan was, and how great and noble a spirit animated her, 
and they implored him to trust in her, believe in her, and 
have faith that she was sent to save France. They begged 
him to consent to see her. He was strongly moved to do 
this, and promised that he would not drop the matter out 
of his mind, but would consult with his council about it. 
This began to look encouraging. Two hours later there 
was a great stir below, and the innkeeper came flying up 
to say a commission of illustrious ecclesiastics was come 
from the King — from the King his very self, understand ! 

think of this vast honour to his humble little hostelry ! — 

and he was so overcome with the glory of it that he could 
hardly find breath enough in his excited body to put the 
facts into words. They were come from the King to speak 
with the Maid of Vaucouleurs. Then he flew downstairs, 
and presently appeared again, backing into the room and 
bowing to the ground with every step, in front of four 
imposing and austere bishops and their train of servants. 

Joan rose, and we all stood. The bishops took seats, 
and for a while no word was said, for it was their preroga- 
tive to speak first, and they were so astonished to see 
what a child it was that was making such a noise in the 
world and degrading personages of their dignity to the 
base function of ambassadors to her in her plebeian tavern, 
that they could not find any words to say, at first. Then 
presently their spokesman told Joan they were aware that 
she had a message for the King, wherefore she was now 
commanded to put it into words, briefly and without waste 
of time or embroideries of speech. 

As for me, I could hardly contain my joy — our message 
was to reach the King at last ! And there was the same 
joy and pride and exultation in the faces of our knights, 
too, and in those of Joan's brothers. And I knew that they 
were all praying — as I was — that the awe which we felt in 
the presence of these great dignitaries, and which would 
have tied our tongues and locked our jaws, would not 

affect her in the Hke degree, but that she would be enabled 
to word her message well, and with little stumbling, and 
so make a favourable impression here, where it would be 
so valuable and so important. 

Ah dear, how little we were expecting what happened 
then ! We were aghast to hear her say what she said. 
She was standing in a reverent attitude, with her head 
down and her hands clasped in front of her ; for she was 
always reverent toward the consecrated servants of God 
When the spokesman had finished, she raised her head and 
set her calm eye on those faces, not any more disturbed 
by their state and grandeur than a princess would have 
been, and said, with all her ordinary simplicity and modesty 
of voice and manner : 

' Ye will forgive me, reverend sirs, but I have no mes- 
sage save for the King's ear alone.' 

Those surprised men were dumb for a moment, and 
their faces flushed darkly ; then the spokesman said : 

' Harkye, do you fling the King's command in his face 
and refuse to deliver this message of yours to his servants 
appomted to receive it ? ' 

' God has appointed one to receive it, and another's 
commandment may not take precedence of that. I pray 
you let me have speech of his grace the Dauphin.' 

' Forbear this folly, and come at your message ! De- 
liver It, and waste no more time about it.' 

' You err indeed, most reverend fathers in God, and it 
is not well. I am not come hither to talk, but to deliver 
Orleans, and lead the Dauphin to his good city of Rheims 
and set the crown upon his head.' ' 

' Is that the message you send to the King ? ' 

But Joan only said, in the simple fashion which was 
her wont : 

' Ye will pardon me for reminding you again— but I 
have no message to send to any one.' 

The King's messengers rose in deep anger and swept 

out of the place without further words, we and Joan 
kneeling as they passed. 

Our countenances were vacant, our hearts full of a 
sense of disaster. Our precious opportunity was thrown 
away ; we could not understand Joan's conduct, she who 
had been so wise until this fatal hour. At last the Sieur 
Bertrand found courage to ask her why she had let this 
great chance to get her message to the King go by. 

' Who sent them here ? ' she asked. 
'The King.' 

' Who moved the King to send them ? ' She waited 
for an answer ; none came, for we began to see what was 
in her mind — so she answered herself : ' The Dauphin's 
council moved him to it. Are they enemies to me and to 
the Dauphin's weal, or are they friends ? ' 

' Enemies,' answered the Sieur Bertrand. 

' If one would have a message go sound and ungarbled, 
does one choose traitors and tricksters to send it by ? ' 

I saw that we had been fools, and she wise. They 
saw it too, so none found anything to say. Then she 
went on : 

' They had but small wit that contrived this trap. 
They thought to get my message and seem to deliver it 
straight, yet deftly twist it from its purpose. You know 
that one part of my message is but this — to move the 
Dauphin by argument and reasonings to give me men-at- 
arms and send me to the siege. If an enemy carried these 
in the right words, the exact words, and no word missing, 
yet left out the persuasions of gesture and supplicating 
tone and beseeching looks that inform the words and 
make them live, where were the value of that argument — 
whom could it convince ? Be patient, the Dauphin will 
hear me presently ; have no fear.' 

The Sieur de Metz nodded his head several times, and 
muttered as to himself : 

' She was right and wise, and we are but dull fools, 
when all is said.' 

It was just my thought : I could have said it myself; 
and indeed it was the thought of all there present. A sort 
of awe crept over us, to think how that untaught girl, 
taken suddenly and unprepared, was yet able to penetrate 
the cunning devices of a King's trained advisers and defeat 
them. Marvelling over this, and astonished at it, we fell 
silent and spoke no more. We had come to know that 
she was great in courage, fortitude, endurance, patience 
conviction, fidelity to all duties— in all things, indeed, that 
make a good and trusty soldier and perfect him for his 
post ; now we were beginning to feel that maybe there 
were greatnesses in her brain that were even greater than 
these great qualities of the heart. It set us thinking. 

What Joan did that day bore fruit the very day after 
The King was obliged to respect the spirit of a young girl 
who could hold her own and stand her ground like that 
and he asserted himself sufficiently to put his respect into 
an act mstead of into polite and empty words. He moved 
Joan out of that poor inn, and housed her, with us her 
servants, in the Castle of Coudray, personally confiding 
her to the care of Madame de Bellier, wife of old Raoul 
de Gaucourt, Master of the Palace. Of course this royal 
attention had an immediate result : all the great lords and 
ladies of the Court began to flock there to see and listen 
to the wonderful girl-soldier that all the world was talkin- 
about, and who had answered the King's mandate with a 
bland refusal to obey. Joan charmed them every one with 
her sweetness and simplicity and unconscious eloquence 
and all the best and capablest among them recognised that 
there was an indefinable something about her that testified 
that she was not made of common clay, that she was built 
on a grander plan than the mass of mankind, and moved 
on a loftier plane. These spread her fame. She always 
made friends and advocates that way ; neither the high 
nor the low could come within the sound of her voice 
and the sight of her face and go out from her presence 
indifferent. 

CHAPTER VI 

Well, anything to make delay. The King's council 
advised him against arriving at a decision in our matter 
too precipitately. He arrive at a decision too precipitately ! 
So they sent a committee of priests — always priests — into 
Lorraine to inquire into Joan's character and history — a 
matter which would consume several weeks, of course. 
You see how fastidious they were. It was as if people 
should come to put out the fire when a man's house was 
burning down, and they waited till they could send into 
another country to find out if he had always kept the 
Sabbath or not, before letting him try. 

So the days poked along, dreary for us young people 
in some ways, but not in all, for we had one great antici- 
pation in front of us — we had never seen a king, and now 
some day we should have that prodigious spectacle to see 
and to treasure in our memories all our lives ; so we were 
on the look-out, and always eager and watching for the 
chance. The others were doomed to wait longer than I, 
as it turned out. One day great news came — the Orleans 
commissioners, with Yolande and our knights, had at last 
turned the council's position and persuaded the King to 
see Joan. 

Joan received the immense news gratefully but without 
losing her head, but with us others it was otherwise ; we 
could not eat or sleep or do any rational thing for the 
excitement and the glory of it. During two days our pair 
of noble knights were in distress and trepidation on Joan's 
account, for the audience was to be at night, and they were 
afraid that Joan would be so paralysed by the glare of 
light from the long files of torches, the solemn pomps and 
ceremonies, the great concourse of renowned personages, 
the brilliant costumes, and the other splendours of the 
Court that she, a simple country maid, and all unused to 

such things, would be overcome by these terrors and make 
a piteous failure. 

No doubt I could have comforted them, but I was not 
free to speak. Would Joan be disturbed by this cheap 
spectacle, this tinsel show, with its small King and his 
butterfly dukelets ? — she who had spoken face to face with 
the princes of heaven, the familiars of God, and seen their 
retinue of angels stretching back into the remoteness of 
the sky, myriads upon myriads, like a measureless fan of 
light, a glory like the glory of the sun streaming from 
each of those innumerable heads, the massed radiance 
filling the deeps of space with a blinding splendour ? I 
thought not. 

Queen Yolande wanted Joan to make the best possible 
impression upon the King and the Court, so she was 
strenuous to have her clothed in the richest stuffs, wrought 
upon the princeliest pattern, and set off with jewels ; but 
in that she had to be disappointed, of course, Joan not 
being persuadable to it, but begging to be simply and 
sincerely dressed, as became a servant of God, and one 
sent upon a mission of a serious sort and grave political 
import. So then the gracious Queen imagined and con- 
trived that simple and witching costume which I have 
described to you so many times, and which I cannot think 
of even now in my dull age without being moved just as 
rhythmical and exquisite music moves one ; for that was 
music, that dress — that is what it was— music that one 
saw with the eyes and felt in the heart. Yes, she was a 
poem, she was a dream, she was a spirit when she was 
clothed in that. 

She kept that raiment always, and wore it several 
times upon occasions of state, and it is preserved to this 
day in the Treasury of Orleans, with two of her swords, 
and her banner, and other things now sacred because they 
had belonged to her. 

At the appointed time the Count of Vendome, a great 
lord of the Court, came richly clothed, with his train of 
servants and assistants, to conduct Joan to the King, 
and the two knights and I went with her, being entitled 
to this privilege by reason of our official positions near her 
person. 

When we entered the great audience hall, there it all 
was, just as I have already painted it. Here were ranks of 
guards in shining armour and with polished halberds ; 
two sides of the hall were like flower-gardens for variety of 
colour and the magnificence of the costumes ; light streamed 
upon these masses of colour from two hundred and fifty 
flambeaux. There was a wide free space down the middle 
of the hall, and at the end of it was a throne royally cano- 
pied, and upon it sat a crowned and sceptred figure nobly 
clothed and blazing with jewels. 

It is true that Joan had been hindered and put off a good 
while, but now that she was admitted to an audience at 
last, she was received with honours granted to only the 
greatest personages. At the entrance door stood four 
heralds in a row, in splendid tabards, with long slender 
silver trumpets at their mouths, with square silken banners 
depending from them embroidered with the arms of France. 
As Joan and the Count passed by, these trumpets gave 
forth in unison one long rich note, and as we moved down 
the hall under the pictured and gilded vaulting, this was 
repeated at every fifty feet of our progress — six times 
in all. It made our good knights proud and happy, and 
they held themselves erect, and stiffened their stride, and 
looked fine and soldierly. They were not expecting this 
beautiful and honourable tribute to our little country maid. 

Joan walked two yards behind the Count, we three 
walked two yards behind Joan. Our solemn march ended 
when we were as yet some eight or ten steps from the throne. 
The Count made a deep obeisance, pronounced Joan's name, 
then bowed again and moved to his place among a group 
of officials near the throne. I was devouring the crowned 
personage with all my eyes, and my heart almost stood 
still with awe. 



The eyes of all others were fixed upon Joan in a gaze of 
wonder which was half worship, and which seemed to say, 
' How sweet — how lovely — how divine ! ' All lips were 
parted and motionless, which was a sure sign that those 
people, who seldom forget themselves, had forgotten them- 
selves now, and were not conscious of anything but the one 
object they were gazing upon. They had the look of people 
who are under the enchantment of a vision. 

Then they presently began to come to life again, rousing 
themselves out of the spell and shaking it off as one drives 
away little by little a clinging drowsiness or intoxication. 
Now they fixed their attention upon Joan with a strong 
new interest of another sort ; they were full of curiosity to 
see what she would do — they having a secret and particular 
reason for this curiosity. So they watched. This is what 
they saw : 

She made no obeisance, nor even any slight inclination 
of her head, but stood looking toward the throne in silence. 
That was all there was to see, at present. 

I glanced up at De Metz, and was shocked at the pale- 
ness of his face. I whispered and said : 
' What is it, man ; what is it ? ' 

His answering whisper was so weak I could hardly catch 
it : 

' They have taken advantage of the hint in her letter to 
play a trick upon her ! She will err, and they will laugh at 
her. That is not the King that sits there.' 

Then I glanced at Joan. She was still gazing stead- 
fastly toward the throne, and I had the curious fancy that 
even her shoulders and the back of her head expressed 
bewilderment. Now she turned her head slowly, and her 
eye wandered along the lines of standing courtiers till it 
fell upon a young man who was very quietly dressed ; then 
her face lighted joyously, and she ran and threw herself at 
his feet, and clasped his knees, exclaiming in that soft 
melodious voice which was her birthright and was now 
charged with deep and tender feeling : 

' God of His grace give you long life, O dear and gentle 
Dauphin ! ' 

In his astonishment and exultation De Metz cried 
out : 

' By the shadow of God, it is an amazing thing ! ' Then 
he mashed all the bones of my hand in his grateful grip, 
and added, with a proud shake of his mane, ' NoWy what 
have these painted infidels to say ! ' 

Meantime the young person in the plain clothes was 
saying to Joan : 

' Ah, you mistake, my child, I am not the King. There 
he is,' and he pointed to the throne. 

The knight's face clouded, and he muttered in grief and 
indignation,: 

' Ah, it is a shame to use her so. But for this lie she 
had gone through safe. I will go and proclaim to all the 
house what — ' 

' Stay where you are ! ' whispered I and the Sieur Ber- 
trand in a breath, and made him stop in his place. 

Joan did not stir from her knees, but still lifted her happy 
face toward the King, and said : 

' No, gracious liege, you are he, and none other.' 
De Metz's troubles vanished away, and he said : 

' Verily, she was not guessing, she knew. Now, how 
could she know? It is a miracle. I am content, and will 
meddle no more, for I perceive that she is equal to her 
occasions, having that in her head that cannot profitabty be 
helped by the vacancy that is in mine.' 

This interruption of his lost me a remark or two of the 
other talk ; however, I caught the King's next question : 

' But tell me who you are, and what would you ? ' 

' I am called Joan the Maid, and am sent to say that the 
King of Heaven wills that you be crowned and consecrated 
in your good city of Rheims, and be thereafter Lieutenant 
of the Lord of Heaven, who is King of France. And He 
willeth also that you set me at my appointed work and give 
me men-at-arms.' After a slight pause she added, her eye 

lighting at the sound of her words, ' For then will I raise 
the siege of Orleans and break the English power ! ' 

The young monarch's amused face sobered a little when 
this martial speech fell upon that sick air like a breath blown 
from embattled camps and fields of war, and his trifling 
smile presently faded wholly away and disappeared. He 
was grave now, and thoughtful. After a little he waved 
his hand lightly, and all the people fell away and left those 
two by themselves in a vacant space. The knights and 
I moved to the opposite side of the hall and stood there. 
We saw Joan rise at a sign, then she and the King talked 
privately together. 

All that host had been consumed with curiosity to see 
what Joan would do. Well, they had seen, and now they 
were full of astonishment to see that she had really per- 
formed that strange miracle according to the promise in 
her letter ; and they were fully as much astonished to find 
that she was not overcome by the pomps and splendours 
about her, but was even more tranquil and at her ease in 
holding speech with a monarch than ever they themselves 
had been, with all their practice and experience. 

As for our two knights, they were inflated beyond 
measure with pride in Joan, but nearly dumb, as to speech, 
they not being able to think out any way to account for her 
managing to carry herself through this imposing ordeal 
without ever a mistake or an awkwardness of any kind to 
mar the grace and credit of her great performance. 

The talk between Joan and the King- was long and 
earnest, and held in low voices. We could not hear, but 
we had our eyes and could note effects ; and presently we 
and all the house noted one eff"ect which was memorable 
and striking, and has been set down in memoirs and his- 
tories and in testimony at the Process of Rehabilitation by 
some who witnessed it ; for all knew it was big' with mean- 
ing, though none knew what that meaning was at that 
time, of course. For suddenly we saw the King shake off 
his indolent attitude and straighten up like a man, and at 



the same time look immeasurably astonished. It was as 
if Joan had told him something almost too wonderful for 
belief, and yet of a most uplifting and welcome nature. 

It was long before we found out the secret of this con- 
versation, but we know it now, and all the world knows it. 
That part of the talk was like this — as one may read in all 
histories. The perplexed King asked Joan for a sign. He 
wanted to believe in her and her mission, and that her 
Voices were supernatural and endowed with knowledge 
hidden from mortals ; but how could he do this unless these 
Voices could prove their claim in some absolutely unassail- 
able way ? It was then that Joan said : 

' I will give you a sign, and you shall no more doubt. 
There is a secret trouble in your heart which you speak of 
to none — a doubt which wastes away your courage, and 
makes you dream of throwing all away and fleeing from 
your realm. Within this little while you have been pray- 
ing, in your own breast, that God of His grace would re- 
solve that doubt, even if the doing of it must show you 
that no kingly right is lodged in you.' 

It was that that amazed the King, for it was as she had 
said : his prayer was the secret of his own breast, and none 
but God could know about it. So he said : 

' The sign is sufficient. I know, now, that these Voices 
are of God. They have said true in this matter ; if they 
have said more, tell it me — I will believe.' 

' They have resolved that doubt, and I bring their very 
words, which are these : Thou art lawful heir to the King 
thy father, and true heir of France. God has spoken it. 
Now lift up thy head, and doubt no more, but give me 
men-at-arms and let me get about my work.' 

Telling him he was of lawful birth was what straight- 
ened him up and made a man of him for a moment, remov- 
ing his doubts upon that head, and convincing him of his 
royal right ; and if any could have hanged his hin- 
dering and pestiferous council and set him free, he would 
have answered Joan's prayer and set her in the field. But 
no, those creatures were only checked, not checkmated ; 
they could invent some more delays. 

We had been made proud by the honours which had so 
distinguished Joan's entrance into that place — honours re- 
stricted to personages of very high rank and worth— but 
that pride was as nothing compared with the pride we had 
in the honour done her upon leaving it. For whereas those 
first honours were shown only to the great, these last, up 
to this time, had been shown only to the royal. The King 
himself led Joan by the hand down the great hall to the 
door, the glittering multitude standing and making rever- 
ence as they passed, and the silver trumpets sounding those 
rich notes of theirs. Then he dismissed her with gracious 
words, bending low over her hand and kissing it. Always 
— from all companies, high or low — she went forth richer 
in honour and esteem than when she came. 

And the King did another handsome thing by Joan, for 
he sent us back to Coudray Castle torch-lighted and in 
state, under escort of his own troop — his guard of honour 
— the only soldiers he had ; and finely equipped and be- 
dizened they were, too, though they hadn't seen the colour 
of their wages since they were children, as a body might 
say. The wonders which Joan had been performing before 
the King had been carried all around by this time, so the 
road was so packed with people who wanted to get a sight 
of her that we could hardly dig through ; and as for talking 
together, we couldn't, all attempts at talk being drowned 
in the storm of shoutings and huzzas that broke out all
