till she should come back there, seemed to 
Maisie a long way round. It reminded her 
of all the things she had been told, first and 
last, that she should have if she would be 
good and that in spite of her goodness she 
had never had at all. " Then who will take 
care of me at papa's ? " 

" Heaven only knows, my own precious ! " 
Miss Overmore replied, tenderly embracing 
her. There was indeed no doubt that she 
was dear to this beautiful friend. What 
could have proved it better than the fact that 
before a week was out, notwithstanding their 
sharp separation and her mother's prohi- 
bition and Miss Overmore's scruples and 
Miss Overmore's promise, the beautiful 
friend had turned up at her father's? The 
little lady already engaged to come there by 
the hour, a fat, dark little lady with a 
foreign name and dirty fingers, who wore, 
throughout, a bonnet that had at first given 
her a deceptive air of not staying long, besides 
asking her pupil questions that had nothing 
to do with lessons, questions that Beale 
Farange himself, when two or three were 
repeated to him, admitted to be awfully 
vulgar this strange apparition faded before 
the bright creature who had braved every- 
thing for Maisie's sake. The bright creature 
told her little charge frankly what had hap- 
pened that she had really been unable to 
hold out. She had broken her vow to Mrs. 
Farange. She had struggled for three days, 
then she had come straight to Maisie's papa 
and told him the simple truth. She adored 
his daughter; she couldn't give her up; she 
would make any sacrifice for her. On this 
basis it had been arranged that she should 
stay; her courage had been rewarded; she 
left Maisie in no doubt as to the amount of 
courage she had required. Some of the 
things she said made a particular impression 
on the child her declaration, for instance, 
that when her pupil should get older she 
would understand better just how "dread- 
fully bold " a young lady, to do exactly what 
she had done, had to be. 

"Fortunately your papa appreciates it; 
he appreciates it immensely " that was one 
of the things Miss Overmore also said, with 
a striking insistence on the adverb. Maisie 
herself was no less impressed with what her 
friend had gone through, especially after 
hearing of the terrible letter that had come 
from Mrs. Farange. Mamma had been so 
angry that, in Miss Overmore' s own words, 
she had loaded her with insult proof 
enough indeed that they must never look 
forward to being together again under 
mamma's roof. Mamma's roof, however, 
had its turn, this time, for the child, of 
appearing but remotely contingent ; so that, 
to reassure her, there was scarce a need of 
her companion's secret, solemnly confided 
the idea that there should be no going 
back to mamma at all. It was Miss Over- 
more' s private conviction, and apart of the 
same communication, that if Mr. Farange's 
daughter would only show a really marked 
preference she would be backed up by 
"public opinion" in holding on to him. 
Poor Maisie could scarcely grasp that incen- 
tive, but she could surrender herself to the 
day. She had conceived her first passion, 
and the object of it was her governess. It 
had not been put to her, and she could n't 
or at any rate she didn't put it to herself, 
that she liked Miss Overmore better than 
she liked papa; but it would have sustained 
her under such an imputation to feel herself 
able to reply that papa too liked Miss Over- 
more exactly as much. He had particularly 
told her so. Besides she could easily see it. 


IV 



ALL this led her on ; but it brought on her 
fate as well, the day when her mother would 
be at the door in the carriage in which 
Maisie now rode on no occasions but these. 
There was no question at present of Miss 
Overmore's going back with her; it was 
universally recognized that the quarrel with 
Mrs. Farange was much too acute. The 
child felt it from the first. There was no 
hugging or exclaiming as that lady drove 
her away; there was only a frightening 
silence, unenlivened even by the invidious 
inquiries of former years, which culminated, 
according to its stern nature, in a still more 
frightening old woman, a figure awaiting her 
on the very doorstep. " You 're to be under 
this lady's care," said her mother. "Take 
her, Mrs. Wix!" she added, addressing the 
figure impatiently and giving the child a 
push in which Maisie felt that she wished 
to set Mrs. Wix an example of energy. 
Mrs. Wix took her, and Maisie felt the next 
day that she would never let her go. She 
had struck her at first, just after Miss Over- 
more, as terrible; but something in her 





voice, at the end of an hour, touched the 
little girl in a spot that had never even been 
reached. Maisie knew later what it was, 
though doubtless she could n't have made a 
statement of it. These were things that a 
few days' conversation with Mrs. Wix lighted 
up. The principal one was a matter that 
Mrs. Wix herself always immediately men- 
tioned; she had had a little girl quite of 
her own, and the little girl had been killed 
on the spot. She had had absolutely nothing 
else in all the world, and her affliction had 
broken her heart. It was comfortably estab- 
lished between them that Mrs. Wix's heart 
was broken. What Maisie felt was that she 
had been, with passion and anguish, a 
mother; and that this was something Miss 
Overmore was n't ; something strangely, con- 
fusingly, that mamma was even less. 

So it was that, in the course of an extra- 
ordinarily short time, she found herself more 
deeply absorbed in the image of the little 
dead Clara Matilda, who, on a crossing in 
the Harrow Road, had been knocked down 
and crushed by the cruellest of hansoms, 
than she had ever found herself in the family 
group made vivid by one of seven. "She 's 
your little dead sister," Mrs. Wix ended by 
saying, and Maisie, all in a tremor of curios- 
ity and compassion, addressed from that 
moment a particular piety to the small in- 
fectious sentiment. Somehow she wasn't a 
real sister, but that only made her the more 
romantic It contributed to this view of her 
that she was never to be spoken of in that 
character to any one else least of all to 
Mrs. Farange, who wouldn't care for her 
nor recognize the relationship. It was to 
be just an unutterable and inexhaustible 
little secret with Mrs. Wix. Maisie knew 
everything about her that could be known, 
everything she had said or done in her little 
mutilated life, exactly how lovely she was, 
exactly how her hair was curled and her 
frocks were trimmed. Her hair came down 
far below her waist; it was of the most won- 
derful gold brightness, just as Mrs. Wix's 
own had been a long time before. Mrs. 
Wix's own was indeed very remarkable still, 
and Maisie had felt at first that she should 
never get on with it. It played a large part 
in the sad and strange appearance, the air 
as of a greasy grayness, which Mrs. Wix 
had presented on the child's arrival. It had 
originally been yellow, but time had turned 
its glow to ashes, to a turbid, sallow, 
unvenerable white. Still excessively abundant, 
it was dressed in a manner of which the 
poor lady appeared not yet to have recognized 
the supersession, with a glossy braid, like a 
large diadem, on the top of her head, and 
behind, at the nape of the neck, a dingy 
rosette like a large button. She wore 
glasses which, in humble reference to a 
divergent obliquity of vision, she called her 
straighteners, and a little ugly snuff-colored 
dress, trimmed with satin bands in the form 
of scallops and glazed with antiquity. The 
straighteners, she explained to Maisie, were 
put on for the sake of others, whom, as she 
believed, they helped to recognize the direc- 
tion, otherwise misleading, of her glance. 
The rest of the melancholy attire could only 
have been put on for herself. With the 
added suggestion of her goggles it reminded 
her pupil of the polished shell or corselet of 
a horrid beetle. At first she had looked 
cross and almost cruel ; but this impression 
passed away with the child's increased per- 
ception of her being, in the eyes of the 
world, a figure mainly for laughter. She 
was passively comical a person whom 
people, to make talk lively, described to 
each other and imitated. Every one knew 
the straighteners ; every one knew the dia- 
dem and the button, the scallops and satin 
bands; everyone, though Maisie had never 
betrayed her, knew even Clara Matilda. 

It was on account of these things that 
mamma got her for so little money, really 
for nothing. So much, one day when Mrs. 
Wix had accompanied her into the drawing- 
room and left her, the child heard one of the 
ladies she found there a lady with eye- 
brows arched like skipping-ropes and thick 
black stitching, like ruled "lines," on beau- 
tiful white gloves announce to another. 
She knew governesses were poor; Miss Over- 
more was unmentionably and Mrs. Wix fa- 
miliarly so. Neither this, however, nor the 
old brown frock, nor the diadem, nor the 
button, made a difference for Maisie in 
the charm put forth through everything, the 
charm of Mrs. Wix's conveying that some- 
how, in her ugliness and her poverty, she was 
peculiarly and soothingly safe, safer than 
any one in the world than papa, than 
mamma, than the lady with the arched 
eyebrows, safer even, though much less 
beautiful, than Miss Overmore, on whose 
loveliness, as she supposed it, the little girl 
was faintly conscious that one could n't rest 
with quite the same tucked-in and kissed- 
for-good-night feeling. Mrs. Wix was as 
safe as Clara Matilda, who was in heaven, 
and yet, embarrassingly, also in Kensal 
Green, where they had been together to see 
her little huddled grave. It was from some- 
thing in Mrs. Wix's tone, which, in spite of 
caricature, remained indescribable and inimi- 
table, that Maisie, before her term with her 
mother was over, drew this sense of a tender- 
ness that would never fail her. If she knew 
her instructress was poor and queer she also 
knew that she was not nearly so "qualified" 
as Miss Overmore, who could say lots of 
dates straight off (letting you hold the book 
yourself), state the position of Malabar, play 
six pieces without notes, and, in a sketch, 
put in beautifully the trees and houses and 
difficult parts. Maisie herself could play 
more pieces than Mrs. Wix, who was more- 
over visibly ashamed of her houses and trees 
and could only, with the help of a smutty 
forefinger, of doubtful legitimacy in the 
field of art, do the smoke coming out of the 
chimneys. 

They dealt, the governess and her pupil, 
in "subjects;" but there were many the 
governess put off from week to week and 
that they never got to at all ; she only used 
to say "We 'll take that in its proper order." 
Her order was a circle as vast as the untrav- 
elled globe. She had not the spirit of 
adventure, and the child could perfectly see 
how many subjects she was afraid of. She 
took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, 
through which, indeed, there flowed the blue 
river of truth. She knew swarms of stories, 
mostly those of the novels she had read, 
relating them with a memory that never 
faltered and a wealth of detail that was 
Maisie's delight. They were all about love 
and beauty and countesses and wickedness. 
Her conversation was practically an end- 
less narrative, a great garden of romance, 
with sudden vistas into her own life and 
gushing fountains of fact. These were the 
parts where they most lingered. She made 
the child take with her again every step of 
her long, lame course and think it a journey 
in an enchanted land. Her pupil acquired 
a vivid vision of every one who had ever, in 
her phrase, knocked against her some of 
them oh so hard! every one literally but 
Mr. Wix, her husband, as to whom nothing 
was mentioned save that he had been dead 
for ages. He had been rather remarkably 
absent from his wife's existence, and Maisie 
was never taken to see his grave. 



THE second parting from Miss Overmore 
had been bad enough, but this first parting 
from Mrs. Wix was much worse. The child 
had lately been to the dentist's; she had a 
term of comparison for the screwed-up 
intensity of the scene. It was dreadfully 
silent, as it had been when her tooth was 
taken out. Mrs. Wix had on that occasion 
grabbed her hand, and they had clung to 
each other with the frenzy of their determi- 
nation not to scream. Maisie, at the 
dentist's, had been heroically still, but just 
when she felt most anguish had become 
aware, on the part of her companion, of an 
audible shriek, a spasm of stifled sympathy. 
This was reproduced by the only sound that 
broke their supreme embrace when, a month 
later, the "arrangement," as her periodical 
up-rootings were called, played the part of 
the horrible forceps. Embedded in Mrs. 
Wix's clasp as her tooth had been sunk in 
her gum, the operation of extracting her 
would really have been a case for chloroform. 
It was a hug that fortunately left nothing to 
say, for the poor woman's want of words, at 
such an hour, seemed to fall in with her 
want of everything. Maisie's alternate 
parent, in the outermost vestibule he liked 
the impertinence of crossing as much as that 
of his late wife's threshold stood over 
them with his open watch and his still more 
open grin, while from the only corner of an 
eye on which something of Mrs. Wix's did n't 
impinge the child saw at the door a brougham 
in which Miss Overmore also waited. She 
remembered the difference when, six months 
before, she had been torn from the breast of 
that more spirited protectress. Miss Over- 
more, then also in the vestibule, but of 
course in the other one, had been thoroughly 
audible and voluble. Her protest had rung 
out bravely, and she had declared that some- 
thing her pupil didn't know exactly what 

was a regular wicked shame. That had 
at the time dimly recalled to Maisie the 
far-away moment of Moddle's great outbreak 

there seemed always to be "shame " con- 
nected in one way or another with her migra- 
tions. At present, while Mrs. Wix's arms 
tightened and the smell of her hair was 





strong, she further remembered how, in 
pacifying Miss Overmore, papa had made 
use of the words, "you dear old duck" an 
expression which, by its oddity, had stuck 
fast in her young mind, having moreover a 
place well prepared for it there by what she 
knew of the governess whom she now always 
mentally characterized as the pretty one. 
She wondered whether this affection would 
be as great as before; that would at all 
events be the case with the prettiness. 
Maisie could see it in the face which showed 
brightly at the window of the brougham. 

The brougham was a token of harmony, 
of the fine conditions papa this time would 
offer. He had usually come for her in a 
hansom with a four-wheeler behind for the 
boxes. The four-wheeler with the boxes on 
it was actually there; but mamma was the 
only lady with whom she had ever been in a 
conveyance of the kind always, of old, 
spoken of by Moddle as a private carriage. 
Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, 
still more private somehow than mamma's; 
and when at last she found herself quite on 
top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously 
rolling away she put to Miss Overmore, 
after another immense and more talkative 





squeeze, a question of which the motive was 
a desire for information as to the continuity 
of a certain sentiment. " Did papa like you 
just the same while I was gone ? " she 
inquired, full of the sense of how markedly 
his favor had been established in her pres- 
ence. She had bethought herself that this 
favor might, like her presence, and as if 
depending on it, be only intermittent and 
for the season. Papa, on whose knee she 
sat, burst into one of those loud laughs of 
his that, however prepared she was, seemed 
always, like some trick in a frightening 
game, to leap forth to make her jump; 
then, before Miss Overmore could speak, he 
replied: "Why, you little donkey, when 
you 're away what have I left to do but just 
to love her?" Miss Overmore hereupon 
immediately took her from him, and they 
had, over her, an hilarious little scrimmage 
of which Maisie caught the surprised obser- 
vation in the white stare of an old lady who 
passed in a victoria. Then her beautiful 
friend remarked to her very gravely : " I 
shall make him understand that if he ever 
again says anything as horrid as that to you 
I shall carry you straight off and we'll go 
and live somewhere together and be good 



 







quiet little girls. " The child could n't quite 
make out why her father's speech had been 
horrid, since it only expressed that apprecia- 
tion which their companion herself, of old, 
described as "immense." To enter more 
into the truth of the matter she appealed to 
him again directly, asked if in all these 
months Miss Overmore had n't been with 
him just as she had been before and just as 
she would be now. " Of course she has, old 
girl, where else could the poor dear be ? " 
cried Beale Farange, to the still greater 
scandal of their companion, who protested 
that unless he straightway "took back" his 
nasty, wicked fib, it would be, this time, not 
only him she would leave, but his child, too, 
and his house and his tiresome troubles 
all the impossible things he had succeeded 
in putting on her. Beale, under this frolic 
menace, took nothing back at all. He was 
indeed apparently on the point of repeating 
his assertion, but Miss Overmore instructed 
her little charge that she was not to listen 
to his bad jokes. She was to understand 
that a lady could n't stay with a gentleman 
that way without some awfully proper reason. 
Maisie looked from one of her companions 
to the other; this was the freshest, mer- 





riest start she had yet enjoyed, but she had 
a shy fear of not exactly believing them. 
" Well, what reason is proper ? " she thought- 
fully demanded. 

"Oh, a long-legged stick of a tomboy; 
there 's none so good as that ! " Her father 
enjoyed both her drollery and his own, and 
tried again to get possession of her an 
effort resisted by the third person and lead- 
ing again to something of a public scuffle. 
Miss Overmore declared to the child that 
she had been all the while with good friends, 
on which Beale Farange went on : " She 
means good friends of mine, you know 
tremendous friends of mine. There has been 
no end of them about that I will say for 
her ! " The child felt bewildered and was 
afterwards for some time conscious of a 
vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to 
the subject of so much amusement and as 
to where her governess had really been. She 
did n't feel at all as if she had been seriously 
told, and no such feeling was supplied by 
anything that occurred later. Her embar- 
rassment, of a precocious, instinctive order, 
attached itself to the idea that this was 
another of the matters that it was not for 
her, as her mother used to say, to go into. 





Therefore, under her father's roof, during 
the time that followed, she made no attempt 
to clear up her ambiguity by a sociable inter- 
rogation of housemaids ; and it was an odd 
truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing 
from the fresh pleasure promised her by 
renewed contact with Miss Overmore. The 
confidence looked for by that young lady was 
of the fine sort that explanation cannot 
improve, and she herself, at any rate, was 
a person superior to all confusion. For 
Maisie, moreover, concealment had never 
necessarily seemed deception, and she had 
grown up among things as to which her 
former knowledge was that she was not to 
ask about them. It was far from new to her 
that the questions of the small are the pecu- 
liar diversion of the great. Except the affairs 
of her doll Lisette, there had scarcely ever 
been anything at her mother's that was 
explicable with a grave face. Nothing was 
so easy to her as to send the ladies who 
gathered there off into shrieks, and she 
might have practised upon them largely if 
she had been of a more calculating turn. 
Everything had something behind it. Life 
was like a long, long corridor with rows of 
closed doors. She had learned that at these 





doors it was wise not to knock that seemed 
to produce, from within, such sounds of 
derision. Little by little, however, she 
understood more, for it befell that she was 
enlightened by Lisette's questions, which 
reproduced the effect of her own upon those 
for whom she sat in the very darkness of 
Lisette. Was she not herself convulsed by 
such innocence ? In the presence of it she 
often imitated the shrieking ladies. There 
were at any rate things she really could n't 
tell even a French doll. She could only 
pass on her lessons and study to produce on 
Lisette the impression of having mysteries 
in her life, wondering the while whether she 
succeeded in the air of shading off, like her 
mother, into the unknowable. When the 
reign of Miss Overmore followed that of 
Mrs. Wix she took a fresh cue, emulating 
her governess and bridging over the interval 
with the simple expectation of trust. Yes, 
there were matters one couldn't go into with 
a pupil. There were, for instance, days 
when, after prolonged absence, Lisette, 
while she took off her things, tried hard to 
discover where she had been. Well, she 
discovered a little, but she never discovered 
all. There was an occasion when, on her 





being particularly indiscreet, Maisie replied 
to her and precisely about the motive of a 
disappearance as she, Maisie, had once 
been replied to by Mrs. Farange, " Find out 
for yourself!" She mimicked her mother's 
sharpness, but she was rather ashamed after- 
wards, though as to whether of the sharpness 
or of the mimicry was not quite clear. 



VI 



SHE became aware in time that this would 
be a period not remarkable for lessons, 
the care of her education being now only 
one of the many duties devolving on Miss 
Overmore; a circumstance as to which she 
was present at various passages between that 
lady and her father passages significant, 
on either side, of dissent and even of dis- 
pleasure. It was gathered by the child on 
these occasions that there was something in 
the situation for which her mother might 
" come down " on them all, though indeed 
the suggestion, always thrown out by her 
father, was greeted on his companion's part 
with particular derision. Such scenes were 
usually brought to a climax by Miss Over- 





more's demanding, in a harsher manner than 
she applied to any other subject, in what 
position under the sun such a person as Mrs. 
Farange would find herself for coming down. 
As the months went on the little girl's 
interpretations thickened, and the more 
effectually that this period was the longest 
she had yet known without a break. She 
became familiar with the idea that her 
mother, for some reason, was in no hurry to 
reinstate her. That idea was forcibly ex- 
pressed by her father whenever Miss Over- 
more, differing and decided, took him up on 
the question, which he was always putting 
forward, of the urgency of sending her to 
school. For a governess Miss Overmore 
differed surprisingly ; far more, for instance, 
than would ever have entered into the head 
of poor Mrs. Wix. She remarked to Maisie 
many times that she was quite conscious of 
not doing her justice and that Mr. Farange 
equally measured and equally lamented this 
deficiency. The reason of it was that she 
had mysterious responsibilities that inter- 
fered responsibilities, Miss Overmore in- 
timated, to Mr. Farange himself and to 
the friendly, noisy little house and those 
who came there. Mr. Farange' s remedy for 



 







every inconvenience was that the child 
should be put to school there were such 
lots of splendid schools, as everybody knew, 
at Brighton and all over the place. That, 
however, Maisie learned, was just what would 
bring her mother down; from the moment 
he should delegate to others the housing of 
his little charge he had n't a leg to stand on 
before the law. Did n't he keep her away 
from her mother precisely because Mrs. 
Farange was one of those others? 

There was also the solution of a second 
governess, a young person to come in by 
the day and really do the work ; but to this 
Miss Overmore would n't for a moment lis- 
ten, arguing against it with great public rel- 
ish and wanting to know from all comers 
she put it to Maisie herself if they 
didn't see how frightfully it would give her 
away. " What am I supposed to be at all, 
don't you see, if I 'm not here to look after 
her?" She was in a false position, and so 
freely and loudly called attention to it that 
it seemed to become almost a source of 
glory. The way out of it, of course, was 
just to do her plain duty; but that was un- 
fortunately what, with his excessive, his 
exorbitant demands on her, which every one 





indeed appeared quite to understand, he 
practically, he selfishly prevented. Beale 
Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never 
anything but " he ; " and the house was as 
full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom, 
under that designation, she chaffingly talked 
about him. Maisie meanwhile, as a subject 
of familiar gossip on what was to be done 
with her, was left so much to herself that 
she had hours of wistful thought of the large, 
loose discipline of Mrs. Wix. Yet she none 
the less held it, under her father's roof, a 
point of superiority that none of his visitors 
were ladies. It added to this odd security 
that she had once heard a gentleman say to 
him as if it were a great joke, and in obvious 
reference to Miss Overmore: "Hanged if 
she 'll let another woman come near you 
hanged if she ever will. She 'd let fly a 
stick at her as they do at a strange cat ! " 
Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inti- 
mates in spite of their also having their way 
louder, but sooner over of laughing out 
at her. They pulled and pinched, they 
teased and tickled her; some of them even, 
as they termed it, shied things at her, and 
all of them thought it funny to call her 
by names having no resemblance to her 





own. The ladies, on the other hand, ad- 
dressed her as " You poor pet " and scarcely 
touched her even to kiss her; but it was of 
the ladies she was most afraid. 

She was old enough now to understand 
how disproportionate a stay she had already 
made with her father; and also old enough 
to enter a little into the ambiguity that sur- 
rounded this circumstance and that oppressed 
her particularly whenever the question had 
been touched upon in talk with her gover- 
ness. " Oh, you need n't worry ; she does n't 
care!" Miss Overmore had often said to her 
in reference to any fear that her mother 
might resent her prolonged detention. " She 
has other people than poor little you to think 
about, and she has gone abroad with them, 
and you needn't be in the least afraid that 
she'll stickle this time for her rights." 
Maisie knew Mrs. Farange had gone abroad, 
for she had had, many weeks before, a letter 
from her, that began "My precious pet" 
and that took leave for an indeterminate 
time ; but she had not seen in it a renuncia- 
tion of hatred or of the writer's policy of 
asserting herself, for the sharpest of all her 
impressions had been that there was nothing 
her mother would ever care so much about 





as to torment Mr. Farange. What at last, 
however, in this connection, was bewilder- 
ing and a little frightening was the dawn of 
a suspicion that a better way had been found 
to torment Mr. Farange than to deprive him 
of his periodical burden. This was the 
question that worried our young lady and 
that Miss Overmore's confidences and the 
frequent observations of her employer only 
rendered more mystifying. It was a contra- 
diction that if Ida had now a fancy for shirk- 
ing the devotion she had originally been so 
hot about her late husband should n't jump 
at the monopoly for which he had also in the 
first instance so fiercely fought; but when 
Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, 
sounded this new ground her main success 
was in hearing her mother more freshly 
abused. Miss Overmore, up to now, had 
rarely deviated from a decent reserve; but 
the day came when she expressed herself 
with a vividness not inferior to Beale's own 
on the subject of the lady who had fled to 
the continent to wriggle out of her job. It 
would serve this lady right, Maisie gathered, 
if that contract, in the shape of an over- 
grown and underdressed daughter, should
