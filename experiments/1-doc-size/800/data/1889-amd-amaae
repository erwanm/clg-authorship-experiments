a much larger place, putting in a broad, easy stair 
case, and connecting it with the room over the office. 
While we were discussing this matter, I asked for an 
increase of salary, and represented that I had done 
something toward working up extra business, and 
that the duties of the place were much more exten 
sive than when I had first taken it, and that no 
doubt the hotel, as well as the natural increase of 
business, would add to the number of passengers. I 
also gently insinuated that I would not be at loss in 
obtaining a much better position. 

When my month's pay reached me, I found my 
talking had been to some purpose/ Five dollars a 
month was not very much, to be sure, but I took 
it with thankfulness. 

By the last of October we made quite a show in 
our greenhouses. For our twenty-five dollars we 
had one hundred and thirty-five roses, some of them 
extremely beautiful ; and we had made a very good 



 

friend of the Messrs. S. & Co. I had sixty of my 
own, besides a number of hardy plants in the ground. 
One of our cold-frames I had filled with some late 
chrysanthemums that I found were going to blossom 
finely. We had many choice geraniums, one very 
handsome white, that looked not unlike a small rose. 
Eve's passion had been bourvardias : we had them in 
all colors, and the dear old-time clove-pinks. Indeed, 
we had a very handsome show of carnations, and 
some splendid young heliotrope. We were to plant 
beds of mignonette and sweet alyssum, and also to 
do what we could in spring-violets. These things 
we thought would be as much as we ought to ven 
ture upon, for we had much still to learn. 

We went in and took possession of our new home. 
The parlor was very large and on the north side. 
No provision had been made for heating this, but on 
the other side one Baltimore heater had been set. 
There was a sitting-room, dining-room, and com 
modious kitchen. Up-stairs on the south side were 
three spacious chambers, two on the north. Three 
were all we should want to use ordinarily. We 
might not be quite so cosey, but it would answer very 
well ; and in case of need we could put up a stove or 
two. At present we could keep warm enough with 
a very moderate fire. 

Walter Benson had spoken for my poultry. I had 



 

thirty-five ordinary hens, mixed considerably with 
Brahma and a Houdan strain, eighteen elegant Leg 
horns with a really superb cock. I had kept these 
apart, and culled out every thing with the slightest 
off feathering or mark. Then I had about sixty 
pullets and cockerels, though we had been using up 
the latter sex. He took the hens of both kinds, and 
forty of the finest pullets, and paid me sixty-five 
dollars. I certainly had made on my poultry, 
though I had done it more to convince myself than 
for actual profit. Eve was quite jubilant, but we 
both decided that we did love the flowers rather 
more. In fact, Eve was a most enthusiastic green 
house girl. I think the hotel project rather trembled 
in the balance, though the building itself was mak 
ing rapid strides. 

I insisted upon dividing my hen-fortune with Eve ; 
and about this time she gave up her last music- 
scholar, although the fair ladies of Athens now 
formed a musical union, and expected to give several 
entertainments through the winter. They had a 
very delightful leader, an enthusiastic, pleasant- 
tempered German. 

My twenty remaining chickens I devoted to the 
family store. I was deeply interested in Walter's suc 
cess, and promised to give him the benefit of my expe 
rience. Besides Mrs. Benson, there was Mrs. Oilman 



 

and her two children ; and they did seem much 
pleased with their new home. The second week in 
October was cold, rainy, and unpleasant, but after 
that it was delightful weather. There was an abun 
dance of grapes for them, some pears and a few 
apples. They bought a horse, and enjoyed the lovely 
drives, and we made them acquainted with several 
of the most agreeable of their neighbors. 

I must not omit to state that our new business had 
already begun. Soon after Mrs. Harwood's return 
to the city, she had sent me an order for every chrys 
anthemum that I could cut. A young friend of hers 
desired to be surrounded by her favorite flower 
at her wedding. I had white, yellow, and four 
shades of pink, one very deep red, a beautiful feath 
ery flower, very large and very delicate-looking. 
From an old root on the place I had raised eight 
elegant plants. I sent them without knowing their 
value, leaving it to her to arrange, and received in 
return a check for seven dollars, with word that 
some of mine were the finest in the display. I think 
we both felt wonderfully elated. We had hardly 
thought to sell them, or indeed any thing, so soon. 
And a few days later we had an order from Mrs. 
Palmer for our choice roses and all the bourvardia 
we had. 

I was so near that I could spend a good deal of my 



 

time at this new and fascinating employment ; and, 
as soon as she had a little leisure, Eve must needs 
stray down, at which Mrs. Pryor complained loudly, 
until I suggested they might both come and live in a 
garden. Jane, our handmaiden, seemed left much to 
her own devices ; but she was a good cook, and, the 
girls said, not extravagant. 

Lawrence Hildreth certainly throve upon his new 
occupation. His angular frame began to fill out, and 
a healthy color came in the place of the pallor that I 
had concluded must be natural. He worked in a 
sensible fashion, leaving off as soon as he felt 
fatigued. 

" I have too much at stake to overdo now," he 
would say with a smile. " My lessons have been suf 
ficiently costly to make me heed them." 

But we walked round about our plantation with 
high hearts. I had an enthusiasm here, that I had 
not experienced about our home : indeed, there had 
always been some presentiment of loss, some vague 
fear, that I could laugh at now. And I was very 
happy. I should have been an ingrate had it proved 
otherwise. 

" But we shall never have this great place full," I 
said one day to Larry. " Every week it seems to grow 
larger to my eyes." 

" I don't know as we shall turn it all into a gar- 



 

den," he replied. " On the avenue next to Mr. Teall's 
we may some day build a house, or houses, unless we 
get so used to living together that we shall never 
want to live alone ; " and he gave a humorous smile. 
There was a row of fine old maples along Ruther 
ford Avenue ; and we set out some trees on Linden 
Street, not enough to shade us in time to come. Mr. 
Riker had built his first greenhouse a little distance 
from the corner. We had a plan of some day adding 
to this by a pretty two-story structure, mostly of 
glass. We had seen one in Northwood that had 
captured our fancy. The greenhouse was eighty- 
seven feet long on Linden Street. The stone foun 
dation was about two feet high, then glass for about 
thirty inches. The building was twenty feet wide : 
the peak of the roof was about eight feet, the path 
down the centre being sunk eighteen inches. On 
each side of the edge of the roof was fastened a 
leader that caught the rain from the roof, and at the 
end they both ran into a cistern. Here were situated 
the boiler-house and a coal-bin, a force-pump, and a 
closet for various useful articles ; and from here ran 
the iron pipes used for heating in winter. . Nearest 
the outside edge along both sides was a wide border 
for plants, while underneath various ferns and plants 
needing shade could be stowed. On iron braces was 
another wide row of shelving just high enough to 



 

clear one's head. In this we had placed our roses. 
The methods of ventilation were excellent, and on 
the Linden-street side the sashes were protected from 
an accidental stone by coarse wire netting that did 
not interfere with the light. 

The other was far enough back of this to escape 
being shaded ; the side toward the north being 
boarded, and the glass roof being pitched all one 
way, with shelves rising step-like for plants. This 
house was seventy-five feet long, and twenty feet 
wide, the heat and water arranged the same as in the 
other. We put our promiscuous plants in here, and 
the borders we prepared for our violets and seedlings. 
I had been gathering fine compost, and had brought 
from the woods several loads of rich soil, and piled 
up some good loam. We had altered this border, 
shoring it up with timber by the path. It was about 
forty inches wide. We made a foundation of rubble, 
sand, and earth, then mixed our soils for the top 
layer. We had now the whole thirty-five feet like a 
large garden-bed. We had ordered one thousand 
violets ; and the day they came, Eve insisted upon 
helping us to plant them out. By this device we 
were spared any trouble of potting ; though we left a 
space between, and kept each kind by itself. In this 
border we also set out fifty heliotrope plants, sowed 
our mignonette, alyssum, and at the end Eve began 



 

a bed of nasturtiums, one of her favorites. We had 
a number of boxes in which we placed three or four 
plants of heliotrope, and the rest of our hundred we 
kept potted. 

Every spare moment through October we worked 
like beavers, doing some things in the evening. At 
the end of the month we were in tolerable order, 
and had bought most of our plants for the present. 
Twice we had gone to auction where private green 
houses were selling out. Our bills stood thus : 

135 roses $25 

15 roses 7 

2 camellias 9 

100 heliotrope 14 

1,000 violets 95 

30 azaleas 25 

100 bourvardia 20 

5 daphne 5 

20 fuchsias 5 

50 heaths 20 

A job lot . 7 

$232 
Fertilizers 15 



Flower-pots 24 

$271 

We had both greenhouses well stocked with these 
and the plants we had. We planted seeds of several 
other things, choice petunias, snow-queen candy- 



 

tuft, and pansies, the last two in a cold-frame. Our 
two houses had looked large, but we began to under 
stand that more would be needed another year, 
though we did not mean to have them so expensive. 
We saw now that Riker's ideas had not been quite 
so wild. Cold-frames I could manage tolerably well 
myself. I had become almost a mason as well as a 
carpenter. 

The last week in October, Eve went to the city. 
Celia was to make her aunt a brief visit. I went 
down twice, and took them to see a play that was 
fascinating everybody, and to hear the "divine 
Patti." That we were enchanted, I hardly need 
state. 

But, oh, how dreary the meals proved ! We were 
not at home the alternate evenings, being so much 
engrossed ; and Mrs. Pryor complained loudly. 

"Really," said Lawrence in a dry tone, "every 
body seems to have a claim upon Eve. What will 

there be left for a husband ? " 



" Take warning," I replied. 

"But, you see, even a piece of cake might be 
better than none, on the half-loaf principle." 

Lawrence had given me a most cordial and 
brotherly welcome when he knew of the bond 
between myself and Celia. 

" Though I half suspected it when we were at the 



 

West," he confessed. "She was always rehearsing 
the superior points of Athens, and thought it quite 
good enough to live in or die in." 

But now that they had Eve in New York, they 
were not going to let her slip so easily. Mrs. Palmer 
and Mrs. Wilbur made so many engagements for her, 
that Mrs. Harwood could sympathize with Helen. 
There were theatre-parties, receptions, teas, and 
dances. She came home now and then quite as a 
visitor. Celia returned after a fortnight, so that I 
had her. Larry could take his turn going to the 
city, which he did quite often. 

We had some cards and circulars printed, and we 
advertised in a paper at Northwood ; for we were 
quite in earnest about making ourselves known. 
Orders from New York came to us, through our 
good friends, I suppose. Now that outdoor flowers 
were gone, and hot-house blossoms rather scarce, new 
people might stand a chance. I found two places in 
the city where I could be sure of disposing of cut- 
flowers. 

I had not expected a profit so soon, but by the 
last of November we had taken in thirty-five dollars. 
But now we were expending our ingenuity in heating 
and ventilation, which had to be narrowly watched. 
Our heater for the rose-house was too large, and 
we did have trouble in tempering it at first. 



 

We found, too, that we had not planned judiciously. 
The heliotrope required more heat than the violets. 
We had " cut-offs " in the pipes, and thermometers at 
different places. On cloudy days we needed greater 
heat. The night temperature bothered us the most. 
Indeed, I slung a hammock, and spent two nights 
studying the alternations. There would be less 
trouble when the weather became colder : we really 
had to guard now against too high a range. The 
watering was more easily managed. An experienced 
florist told us not to water until a plant required 
it, - was, indeed, dry on the surface, and then fill 
the pots to the brim. Twice a week, plants were to 
be showered. Heliotrope and roses required extra 
fertilizing. We kept guano-water in a cask, and 
applied it to some of the plants twice a week, to the 
others but once. 

Among the things I characterized as a job lot 
were numerous bulbs, hyacinth, amaryllis, and lilies 
of various kinds. We resolved to bring our hyacinths 
into the market early, and. covered them up in the 
mould a short distance from the pipes, potting them 
as soon as they budded. 



 



CHAPTER XX 

NABOBS IN A SMALL WAY 

WE all kept the feast of Thanksgiving with Mrs. 
Wilbur. I petitioned for the " extra man ; " and as 
I was in good repute with the company, he was sent 
without demur, though he did not come until noon. 
Lawrence and the Pryors had gone down in the 
morning. Jane must have thought her numerous 
mistresses sad gad-abouts ; but she was given a day 
out as well. Joe promised to see that all went well 
with the greenhouses, which were like a first baby, 

we hardly dared take our eyes off of them. But 
he was quite as much infatuated as we : indeed, I 
think only the aim of being a partner in a good busi 
ness kept him from taking service with us. 

The hotel was enclosed, and looked quite preten 
tious ; though the prettiest part of the roof a tower 

was to be in the wing. Still, there were some or 
namental peaks and windows. A wide piazza was 
to run across the front, and two bow-windows were 
to be set on the roof of this, with balconies for the 



 

windows above. We had decided that it must hold 
all of us the next year; for Lawrence and I could not 
be so far away, and Pryor was resolved to have Eve. 

The day was splendid ; rather crisp and cold, but 
with a magnificent sun. I took with me a box of 
beautiful roses, and had sent some to Ruth and Joe, 
who were to have the Montgomery household to 
dine. 

How proud and exultant I felt as I stepped on the 
train ! I believe I did not even envy our president, 
who considered himself one of the coming great 
railroad-men. I found them all assembled, waiting 
to welcome me. Mrs. Harwood was there, looking 
prettier than ever, and keeping Eve under her wing, 
like a hen with one chick ; Mrs. Brooke ; Mr. and 
Mrs. Palmer ; Miss Laverne, the Southern cousin ; 
Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth, ne Bertha Brooke; and 
our own six. 

I am afraid we talked "shop." It was green 
house and hotel, and yet we found time for no end 
of chaffing. They admired the roses enthusiastically: 
there were three of a new kind, that had made their 
first essay at blooming. We had some music, and 
I found we were all to go to the opera. Dinner was 
at four. It was a dinner of the season, of course, 
and we enjoyed it heartily. I took out Mrs. 
Harwood. Two friends of Mr. Wilbur's came in, a 



 

Mr. Woolfe, and Mr. Bernard, who, by the way, was 
well acquainted with Celia. She looked so bright 
and winsome, that more than once I almost won 
dered how she had come to accept me, after all. 

The evening was most delightful. We had a 
dainty supper afterward, then Lawrence and I 
wended our way homeward. Luckily for us, there 
was a midnight train. We cast a lingering look at 
the gleaming roofs that protected our heart's treas 
ures, then trudged on up the hill. 

"I declare," said Hildreth, "I feel as if I had 
taken a new lease of life, and might live to be a 
hundred. I grow stronger every day. Think of me 
last year at this time." 

Somehow after that every thing went on with a 
rush. The freight-house was finished, and business 
seemed on the increase. Joe was here and there, 
his bright, manly face clear and smiling. Pryor 
almost flew about, as there was a prospect of con 
siderable building. The " scratch-coat " was put on 
the hotel : the Musical Union gave a concert, which 
was splendidly attended at fifty cents a ticket, and 
passed off finely, leading to a talk of building a real 
hall, as the only one Athens could boast of was a 
rather poor affair over some stores. Then there 
were Christmas preparations. Celia was very busy; 
and I thought it too hard for her to come home 



 

every night, since Eve was away so much. She, 
radiant girl, was as gay as a butterfly, like the Eve 
I had known at aunt Carry's. 

As for us, we made some mistakes, but, in the 
main, were successful. Our violets began to bloom, 
and the mignonette showed buds. Of course, there 
was a demand for every thing at Christmas-tide. I 
had brought down a tub of callas in the fall, intend 
ing to pot them, but had been too busy, until I 
found, with the warmth and watering, they were in 
bud. I had five out by Christmas. We had some 
calls from the little towns around, two large orders 
from New York, and numerous private orders. On 
making up our books the 1st of January, I found 
we had sold to the amount of sixty-five dollars, and 
could have done better if we had had the flowers 
desired. But we counted on quite a harvest during 
the month to come. 

Our Christmas was not spent together, and I 
seemed to be the one counted out of most things. 
Eve went to Baltimore with Mrs. Harwood for a 
fortnight. Evidently she meant to hold my sister 
with a close hand ; but she was so sweet and gener 
ous, no one could say her nay. The Hildreths had 
been hunted up by some Philadelphia cousins in a 
very cordial manner, and invited for holiday week. 
Christmas fell on Sunday. On Friday, Eve started. 





At the last moment she had half a mind to 
decline. 

" If Celia wasn't going ! And you to be left 
alone ! " she exclaimed pathetically. 

" Some one must stay with the greenhouse, and 
the station refuses to carry on its business without 
a clerk. Besides, I am to take Christmas dinner 
with Joe." 

Eve kissed me with a fond, lingering good-by. 
Then, on Saturday, Lawrence and Celia went. I think 
she, dear girl, would easily have declined the invita 
tion ; but Lawrence was very urgent, thinking to 

visit the Messrs. S again, and see their beautiful 

greenhouses in winter. The Pryors were to be in 
New York : indeed, we decided to shut up the house, 
and give Jane a holiday. 

Sunday morning I went to church with Joe. I 
did miss Eve's voice in the singing. I must say 
I had never liked Mr. Bradford better. I certainly 
was coming to pay him a much higher regard, and 
he had quite won Joe's heart. 

The week passed without any special incident. 
Letters came from all the travellers, who were en 
joying themselves immensely : indeed, the Hildreths 
were to be kept captive until the second day of the 
New Year. 

The first of January was simply magnificent. It 



 

seemed like an April day. In the brightness of the 
morning sunshine was born Joe Crawford's baby, 
a boy, and both parents were wild with delight. 
I had brought up some lovely flowers for Ruth. 

"And he is to be named for you, my best, my 
dearest friend," declared Joe, wringing my hand; 
" and if he will only be as good and noble and gen 
erous " 

" O Joe, hush ! " I cried earnestly : " you must 
begin to see that you have used some strength of 
your own ; that others have befriended you to more 
purpose than my few efforts " 

" But you were the first. You made it possible 
for me to accept the rest, for it to be offered to me. 
No, in my heart you will always be first, best ; and 
though my boy will never understand it, he, too, will 
owe you a debt of gratitude." 

" Not if he is saddled with such a queer old-time 
name. It was my father's fancy to call us after the 
first two, and Eve does very well ; but Adam ! " and 
I laughed with a little contempt. " Anyhow, wait 
until Eve returns home. She ought to have a voice 
in the name." 

Mrs. Pryor came down, and insisted upon taking 
the first hug out of the baby. Indeed, Joe's baby 
created quite a sensation, in spite of there being so 
many babies in the world. 



 

Celia and her brother returned delighted with their 
visit. These Philadelphia people were Hildreth 
relatives, and for a number of years had dropped 
out of sight, more by accident than design. They 
were loth to let Celia return, and wished both were 
to be settled in the Quaker City. Lawrence had 
enjoyed himself wonderfully, and came home full of 
plans and projects, and, if it had not been winter, 
would at once have plunged into building green 
houses. 

" But we do look splendid," he commented enthu 
siastically. " I can't help thinking that I have struck 
just the right thing. Why, it fairly bewitches me ; 
and I've caught up to you in love if I have not in 
knowledge. I've studied every spare moment, and 
asked enough questions to vex any one who was not a 

born florist. I told the Messrs. S about you too, 

and promised to send you next time. Ad, you must 
take a vacation. It is selfish for me to have all the 
good times." 

I laughed at that. I was glad enough to see him 
looking so well and in such bright spirits. 

We went back to our usual living. Celia staid 
home the remainder of the week. On Thursday it 
blew off very cold, and Friday morning it began to 
snow. All day the storm increased. Trains were 
delayed, roads blocked, and though about nightfall 



 

the snow ceased, it seemed more bitterly cold than 
before. 

" I shall stay down all night," I said to Larry. 

He insisted that he should, also, but I overruled 
him. I was a little afraid of some cold or trouble ; 
and finally he gave in, for his greatest desire now 
was to be strong and well. About nine I took a 
blanket and hammock, and after looking at the fires 
and the dampers, and seeing the temperatures were 
right, I rolled myself in the blanket, and settled for a 
nap among my fragrant roses. It was a rather warm 
and sweet atmosphere, but I could sleep anywhere. 
I left my lamp burning. How the wind did roar and 
tear about in great gusts ! I felt almost as if the 
houses might be moved off their foundation. 

But presently I slept soundly, three solid hours. 
It was two when I looked at rny watch. I roused 
myself from my rather cramped position, sprang 
out, and glanced at the thermometer. It was. fifty 
degrees, hardly up to the mark for roses and helio 
trope. I had brought all my largest plants in here, 
and they were showing bud. So I stirred up my 
fire. I wondered with a little shiver how the other 
house was doing, and dreaded to plough through the 
snow. However, there was a good deal at stake, and 
it was eternal vigilance here as well as elsewhere. 
So, wrapped in my blanket, lantern in hand, I sallied 



 

out, going up to my knees in snow. We had 
resolved, before another winter, to connect the 
houses. The biting wind shaved my face. I un 
locked the door and entered. 

I had not come a moment too soon. The highest 
temperature was forty-six degrees, the lowest forty 
degrees. I put on the draughts immediately. If- I
had waited until morning, my plants would have 
been ruined. For the next hour I watched and 
tramped around until it came up to fifty-two degrees. 
I knew it would rise a little higher, and that outside 
it could not well be colder ; so I returned, and, find 
ing matters right here, again settled myself to my 
hammock. Hard work, do you say? Well, as a 
lad in a Western station, I used to go out at one 
o'clock, and switch off one cattle-train that a freight 
and express might pass, there being but one track. 
If I had overslept, or been taken suddenly ill, a 
smash-up would have been the result. I have some 
times run up and down the track fifteen minutes on 
the coldest of nights, lest drowsiness should over 
come me. Ah ! this was heaven itself compared to 
that dreariness. 

I slept until morning in my Eden. All things 
were right, when a far-off whistle roused me. I ran 
up to the station. The few who took this train had 
commutation tickets; but I always preferred being 



 

on hand, though it was now behind time. Then 
I began to shovel snow : I do not think there had 
ever been such a storm at Athens. The roads were 
impassable until the snow-plough came out. The 
trains wheezed and groaned along ; but, oh, how 
lovely the world looked ! The gray sky turned to 
blue : there were bars of faint yellow in the east, and 
presently a pale sun struggled through. We had 
been to zero in the night, and now were slowly 
crawling up, but the wind had ceased blowing. 

Lawrence came down with my breakfast and some 
coffee, which we heated anew on the stove, and 
I toasted my piece of steak. We impressed one of 
the indolent Athenians into shovelling snow, had 
our station-platform cleared, and some paths made 
about our greenhouses. Every thing was all right. 
Larry insisted upon being very grateful, but I would 
have it that the business risk was fully as much 
mine as his. 

"And when we come to real living, it must be 
nearer by," said he. " I feel rather sorry that we are 
up there on the hill, but for Pryor's sake I wouldn't 
make any change. He is such a capital good fellow. 
But, Ad, I am thankful you did sell your house to so 
good an advantage." 

Certainly, it was a piece of rare good fortune. 

Pryor grumbled a little as well. He had never 



 

lived so far away. He brought Mrs. Pryor and 
Celia down in his sleigh. They could not spend a 
long, dreary day alone in the house. 

" If Eve does not come home, we will have to move 
down in town. What did possess us to take a house 
so far from the station ! " 

I laughed at this. " Why, it has never seemed 
any great distance to you all," I said. 

"Well, we are lonesome without Eve, that is 
the truth ; and we have come to spend the day in the 
greenhouses," was the reply. 

Down we went. We had the hammock and some 
stools. We envied no one Florida or Bermuda. 
The girls strolled around in the warm, fragrant 
atmosphere, did a little work, then rested, reading 
novels. It was a kind of fairy-land. They had 
brought some lunch, and Pryor came up from Joe's 
with some steaming coffee and cups. We had a 
regular picnic. 

" What a silly thing to leave this space between 
the houses ! " said Lawrence ; " and how delightful 
it will be to glass it all over, and wander about at 
one's will ! " 

Celia considered this quite a brilliant scheme. 
They were about twenty feet apart now. We could 
put two rows in between, with a- width of ten feet 
apiece, which would give us a fine lot of room. 



 

We wandered about : we made love, let me be 
honest ; how could one help it amid roses and violets, 
and all sweet things ? The sun sparkled over the 
snow outside, but the keen air nipped your cheeks 
the instant you stirred out. Well, we were in 
Arcadie. 

The roads were quite broken and cleared up that 
day, and the weather some ten degrees warmer. I 
ventured to go home and go to bed, like a reasonable 
human being ; and the next day the world was jolly 
with sleigh-riding. Lawrence went to New York 
with boxes of flowers, and brought home orders for 
the first heliotrope we could rush into market. It 
seemed to me that people were crazy about flowers. 
How could they be willing to spend so much money 
for such fragile, perishable things? Had I really 
touched the secret spring of a successful business ?
