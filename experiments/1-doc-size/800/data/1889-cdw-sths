The schools of Cincinnati have not adopted manual training, but a
Technical School has been in existence about a year, with promise of
success. The Cincinnati University under the presidency of Governor Cox
shows new vitality. It is supported in part by taxation, and is open
free to all resident youth, so that while it is not a part of the
public-school system, it supplements it.

Cincinnati has had a great many discouragements of late, turbulent
politics and dishonorable financial failures. But, for all that, it
impresses one as a solid city, with remarkable development in the higher
civilization.

In its physical aspect Louisville is in every respect a contrast to
Cincinnati. Lying on a plain, sloping gently up from the river, it
spreads widely in rectangular uniformity of streets—a city of broad
avenues, getting to be well paved and well shaded, with ample spaces in
lawns, houses detached, somewhat uniform in style, but with an air of
comfort, occasionally of elegance and solid good taste. The city has
an exceedingly open, friendly, cheerful appearance. In May, with its
abundant foliage and flowery lawns, it is a beautiful city: a beautiful,
healthful city in a temperate climate, surrounded by a fertile country,
is Louisville. Beyond the city the land rises into a rolling country of
Blue-Grass farms, and eastward along the river are fine bluffs broken
into most advantageous sites for suburban residences. Looking northward
across the Ohio are seen the Indiana “Knobs.” In high-water the river
is a majestic stream, covering almost entirely the rocks which form the
“Falls,” and the beds of “cement” which are so profitably worked.
The canal, which makes navigation round the rapids, has its mouth at
Shipping-port Island. About this spot clusters much of the early romance
of Louisville. Here are some of the old houses and the old mill built
by the Frenchman Tarascon in the early part of the century. Here in a
weather-beaten wooden tenement, still standing, Taras-con offered border
hospitality to many distinguished guests; Aaron Burr and Blennerhasset
were among his visitors, and General Wilkinson, the projector of the
canal, then in command of the armies of the United States; and it was
probably here that the famous “Spanish conspiracy” was concocted. Corn
Island, below the rapids, upon which the first settlement of Louisville
was made in 1778, disappeared some years ago, gradually washed away by
the swift river.

Opposite this point, in Indiana, is the village of Clarksville, which
has a unique history. About 1785 Virginia granted to Gen. George Rogers
Clark, the most considerable historic figure of this region, a large
tract of land in recognition of his services in the war. When Virginia
ceded this territory to Indiana the township of Clarksville was
excepted from the grant. It had been organized with a governing board
of trustees, self-perpetuating, and this organization still continues.
Clarksville has therefore never been ceded to the United States, and if
it is not an independent community, the eminent domain must still rest
in the State of Virginia.

Some philosophers say that the character of a people is determined by
climate and soil. There is a notion in this region that the underlying
limestone and the consequent succulent Blue-Grass produce a race of
large men, frank in manner, brave in war, inclined to oratory and
ornamental conversation, women of uncommon beauty, and the finest horses
in the Union. Of course a fertile soil and good living conduce to beauty
of form and in a way to the free graces of life. But the contrast of
Cincinnati and Louisville in social life and in the manner of doing
business cannot all be accounted for by Blue-Grass. It would be very
interesting, if one had the knowledge, to study the causes of this
contrast in two cities not very far apart. In late years Louisville has
awakened to a new commercial life, as one finds in it a strong infusion
of Western business energy and ambition. It is jubilant in its growth
and prosperity. It was always a commercial town, but with a dash of
Blue-Grass leisure and hospitality, and a hereditary flavor of manners
and fine living. Family and pedigree have always been held in as high
esteem as beauty. The Kentuckian of society is a great contrast to
the Virginian, but it may be only the development of the tide-water
gentleman in the freer, wider opportunities of the Blue-Grass region.
The pioneers of Kentucky were backwoodsmen, but many of the early
settlers, whose descendants are now leaders in society and in the
professions, came with the full-blown tastes and habits of Virginia
civilization, as their spacious colonial houses, erected in the latter
part of the last century and the early part of this, still attest. They
brought and planted in the wilderness a highly developed social state,
which was modified into a certain freedom by circumstances. One can
fancy in the abundance of a temperate latitude a certain gayety and
joyousness in material existence, which is contented with that, and
has not sought the art and musical development which one finds in
Cincinnati. All over the South, Louisville is noted for the beauty of
its women, but the other ladies of the South say that they can always
tell one from Louisville by her dress, something in it quite aware of
the advanced fashion, something in the “cut”—a mystery known only to the
feminine eye.

I did not intend, however, to enter upon a disquisition of the different
types of civilization in Cincinnati and in Louisville. One observes them
as evidences of what has heretofore been mentioned, the great variety
in American life, when one looks below the surface. The traveller enjoys
both types, and is rejoiced to find such variety, culture, taking in one
city the form of the worship of beauty and the enjoyment of life, and
in the other greater tendency to the fine arts. Louisville is a city of
churches, of very considerable religious activity, and of pretty stanch
orthodoxy. I do not mean to say that what are called modern ideas do
not leaven its society. In one of its best literary clubs I heard the
Spencerian philosophy expounded and advocated with the enthusiasm and
keenness of an emancipated Eastern town. But it is as true of Louisville
as it is of other Southern cities that traditional faith is less
disturbed by doubts and isms than in many Eastern towns. One notes
here also, as all over the South, the marked growth of the temperance
movement. The Kentuckians believe that they produce the best fluid from
rye and corn in the Union, and that they are the best judges of it.
Neither proposition will be disputed, nor will one trifle with a
legitimate pride in a home production; but there is a new spirit abroad,
and both Bourbon and the game that depends quite as much upon the
knowledge of human nature as upon the turn of the cards are silently
going to the rear. Always Kentuckians have been distinguished in
politics, in oratory, in the professions of law and of medicine; nor has
the city ever wanted scholars in historical lore, men who have not only
kept alive the traditions of learning and local research, like Col. John
Mason Brown, but have exhibited the true antiquarian spirit of Col.
H. T. Durrett, whose historical library is worth going far to see and
study. It will be a great pity if his exceedingly valuable collection is
not preserved to the State to become the nucleus of a Historical Society
worthy of the State’s history. When I spoke of art it was in a public
sense; there are many individuals who have good pictures and especially
interesting portraits, and in the early days Kentucky produced at least
one artist, wholly self-taught, who was a rare genius. Matthew H. Jouett
was born in Mercer County in 1780, and died in Louisville in 1820. In
the course of his life he painted as many as three hundred and fifty
portraits, which are scattered all over the Union. In his mature years
he was for a time with Stuart in Boston. Some specimens of his work in
Louisville are wonderfully fine, recalling the style and traditions
of the best masters, some of them equal if not superior to the best
by Stuart, and suggesting in color and solidity the vigor and grace of
Vandyck. He was the product of no school but nature and his own genius.
Louisville has always had a scholarly and aggressive press, and its
traditions are not weakened in Mr. Henry Watterson. On the social side
the good-fellowship of the city is well represented in the Pendennis
Club, which is thoroughly home-like and agreeable. The town has at
least one book-store of the first class, but it sells very few American
copyright books. The city has no free or considerable public library.
The Polytechnic Society, which has a room for lectures, keeps for
circulation among subscribers about 38,000 books. It has also a
geological and mineral collection, and a room devoted to pictures, which
contains an allegorical statue by Canova.

In its public schools and institutions of charity the city has a great
deal to show that is interesting. In medicine it has always been famous.
It has four medical colleges, a college of dentistry, a college of
pharmacy, and a school of pharmacy for women. In nothing, however,
is the spirit of the town better exhibited than in its public-school
system. With a population of less than 180,000, the school enrolment,
which has advanced year by year, was in 1887, 21,601, with an aggregate
belonging of 17,392. The amount expended on schools, which was in 1880
$197,699, had increased to $323,943 in 1887—a cost of $18.62 per pupil.
Equal provision is made for colored schools as for white, but the number
of colored pupils is less than 3000, and the colored high-school is
small, as only a few are yet fitted to go so far in education. The
negroes all prefer colored teachers, and so far as I could learn, they
are quite content with the present management of the School Board.
Co-education is not in the Kentucky idea, nor in its social scheme.
There are therefore two high-schools—one for girls and one for boys—both
of the highest class and efficiency, in excellent buildings, and under
most intelligent management. Among the teachers in the schools are
ladies of position, and the schools doubtless owe their good character
largely to the fact that they are in the fashion: as a rule, all the
children of the city are educated in them. Manual training is not
introduced, but all the advanced methods in the best modern schools,
object-lessons, word-building, moulding, and drawing, are practised.
During the fall and winter months there are night schools, which are
very well attended. In one of the intermediate schools I saw an exercise
which illustrates the intelligent spirit of the schools. This was an
account of the early settlement, growth, and prosperity of Louisville,
told in a series of very short papers—so many that a large number of
the pupils had a share in constructing the history. Each one took up
connectively a brief period or the chief events in chronological order,
with illustrations of manners and customs, fashions of dress and mode
of life. Of course this mosaic was not original, but made up of extracts
from various local histories and statistical reports. This had the merit
of being a good exercise as well as inculcating an intelligent pride in
the city.

Nearly every religious denomination is represented in the 142 churches
of Louisville. Of these 9 are Northern Presbyterian and 7 Southern
Presbyterian, 11 of the M.E. Church South and 6 of the M.E. Church
North, 18 Catholic, 7 Christian, 1 Unitarian, and 31 colored. There are
seven convents and monasteries, and a Young Men’s Christian Association.
In proportion to its population, the city is pre-eminent for public
and private charities: there are no less than thirty-eight of these
institutions, providing for the infirm and unfortunate of all ages
and conditions. Unique among these in the United States is a very fine
building for the maintenance of the widows and orphans of deceased
Freemasons of the State of Kentucky, supported mainly by contributions
of the Masonic lodges. One of the best equipped and managed industrial
schools of reform for boys and girls is on the outskirts of the city.
Mr. P. Caldwell is its superintendent, and it owes its success, as all
similar schools do, to the peculiar fitness of the manager for this sort
of work. The institution has three departments. There were 125 white
boys and 79 colored boys, occupying separate buildings in the same
enclosure, and 41 white girls in their own house in another enclosure.

The establishment has a farm, a garden, a greenhouse, a library
building, a little chapel, ample and pleasant play-yards. There is as
little as possible the air of a prison about the place, and as much as
possible that of a home and school. The boys have organized a very fair
brass band. The girls make all the clothes for the establishment; the
boys make shoes, and last year earned $8000 in bottoming chairs. The
school is mainly sustained by taxation and city appropriations; the
yearly cost is about $26,000. Children are indentured out when good
homes can be found for them.

The School for the Education of the Blind is a State institution,
and admits none from outside the State. The fine building occupies a
commanding situation on hills not far from the river, and is admirably
built, the rooms spacious and airy, and the whole establishment is
well ordered. There are only 79 scholars, and the few colored are
accommodated by themselves in a separate building, in accordance with
an Act of the Legislature in 1884 for the education of colored blind
children. The distinction of this institution is that it has on its
premises the United States printing-office for furnishing publications
for the blind asylums of the country. Printing is done here both in
letters and in points, by very ingenious processes, and the library is
already considerable. The space required to store a library of books
for the blind may be reckoned from the statement that the novel of
“Ivan-hoe” occupies three volumes, each larger than Webster’s Unabridged
Dictionary. The weekly Sunday-school Times is printed here. The point
writing consists entirely of dots in certain combinations to represent
letters, and it is noticed that about half the children prefer this
to the alphabet. The preference is not explained by saying that it is
merely a matter of feeling.

The city has as yet no public parks, but the very broad streets—from
sixty to one hundred and twenty feet in width—the wide spacing of the
houses in the residence parts, and the abundant shade make them less a
necessity than elsewhere. The city spreads very freely and openly over
the plain, and short drives take one into lovely Blue-Grass country.
A few miles out on Churchill Downs is the famous Jockey Club Park, a
perfect racing track and establishment, where worldwide reputations are
made at the semi-annual meetings. The limestone region, a beautifully
rolling country, almost rivals the Lexington plantations in the raising
of fine horses. Driving out to one of these farms one day, we passed,
not far from the river, the old Taylor mansion and the tomb of Zachary
Taylor. It is in the reserved family burying-ground, where lie also the
remains of Richard Taylor, of Revolutionary memory. The great tomb and
the graves are overrun thickly with myrtle, and the secluded irregular
ground is shaded by forest-trees. The soft wind of spring was blowing
sweetly over the fresh green fields, and there was about the place an
air of repose and dignity most refreshing to the spirit. Near the
tomb stands the fine commemorative shaft bearing on its summit a good
portrait statue of the hero of Buena Vista. I liked to linger there, the
country was so sweet; the great river flowing in sight lent a certain
grandeur to the resting-place, and I thought how dignified and fit it
was for a President to be buried at his home.

The city of Louisville in 1888 has the unmistakable air of confidence
and buoyant prosperity. This feeling of confidence is strengthened
by the general awakening of Kentucky in increased immigration of
agriculturists, and in the development of extraordinary mines of coal
and iron, and in the railway extension. But locally the Board of
Trade (an active body of 700 members) has in its latest report most
encouraging figures to present. In almost every branch of business there
was an increase in 1887 over 1886; in both manufactures and trade
the volume of business increased from twenty to fifty per cent. For
instance, stoves and castings increased from 16,574,547 pounds to
19,386,808; manufactured tobacco, from 12,729,421 pounds to 17,059,006;
gas and water pipes, from 56,083,380 pounds to 63,745,216; grass and
clover seed, from 4,240,908 bushels to 6,601,451. A conclusive item
as to manufactures is that there were received in 1887 951,767 tons
of bituminous coal, against 204,221 tons in 1886. Louisville makes
the claim of being the largest tobacco market in the world in bulk and
variety. It leads largely the nine principal leaf-tobacco markets in
the West. The figures for 1887 are—receipts, 123,569 hogsheads;
sales, 135,192 hogsheads; stock in hand, 36,431 hogsheads, against the
corresponding figures of 62,074, 65,924, 13,972 of its great rival,
Cincinnati. These large figures are a great increase over 1886, when
the value of tobacco handled here was estimated at nearly $20,000,000.
Another great interest always associated with Louisville, whiskey, shows
a like increase, there being shipped in 1887 119,637 barrels, against
101,943 barrels in 1886. In the Louisville collection district there
were registered one hundred grain distilleries, with a capacity of
80,000 gallons a day. For the five years ending June 30, 1887, the
revenue taxes on this product amounted to nearly $30,000,000. I am not
attempting a conspectus of the business of Louisville, only selecting
some figures illustrating its growth. Its manufacture of agricultural
implements has attained great proportions. The reputation of Louisville
for tobacco and whiskey is widely advertised, but it is not generally
known that it has the largest plough factory in the world. This is one
of four which altogether employ about 2000 hands, and make a product
valued at $2,275,000. In 1880 Louisville made 80,000 ploughs; in 1886,
190,000. The capacity of manufacture in 1887 was increased by the
enlargement of the chief factory to a number not given, but there were
shipped that year 11,005,151 pounds of ploughs. There is a steadily
increasing manufacture of woollen goods, and the production of the mixed
fabric known as Kentucky jeans is another industry in which Louisville
leads the world, making annually 7,500,000 yards of cloth, and its four
mills increased their capacity twenty per cent, in 1887. The opening of
the hard-wood lumber districts in eastern Kentucky has made Louisville
one of the important lumber markets: about 125,000,000 feet of
lumber, logs, etc., were sold here in 1887. But it is unnecessary
to particularize. The Board of Trade think that the advantages of
Louisville as a manufacturing centre are sufficiently emphasized from
the fact that during the year 1887 seventy-three new manufacturing
establishments, mainly from the North and East, were set up, using
a capital of $1,290,500, and employing 1621 laborers. The city has
twenty-two banks, which had, July 1, 1887, $8,200,200 capital, and
$19,927,138 deposits. The clearings for 1887 were $281,110,402—an
increase of nearly $50,000,000 over 1886.

Another item which helps to explain the buoyant feeling of Louisville is
that its population increased over 10,000 from 1886 to 1887, reaching,
according to the best estimate, 177,000 people. I should have said also
that no city in the Union is better served by street railways, which
are so multiplied and arranged as to “correspondences” that for one
fare nearly every inhabitant can ride within at least two blocks of his
residence. In these cars, as in the railway cars of the State, there
is the same absence of discrimination against color that prevails in
Louisiana and in Arkansas. And it is an observation hopeful, at least to
the writer, of the good time at hand when all party lines shall be drawn
upon the broadest national issues, that there seems to be in Kentucky no
social distinction between Democrats and Republicans.




XIII.—MEMPHIS AND LITTLE ROCK.

The State of Tennessee gets its diversity of climate and productions
from the irregularity of its surface, not from its range over degrees
of latitude, like Illinois; for it is a narrow State, with an average
breadth of only a hundred and ten miles, while it is about four hundred
miles in length, from the mountains in the east—the highest land east
of the Rocky Mountains—to the alluvial bottom of the Mississippi in the
west. In this range is every variety of mineral and agricultural wealth,
with some of the noblest scenery and the fairest farming-land in the
Union, and all the good varieties of a temperate climate.

In the extreme south-west corner lies Memphis, differing as entirely
in character from Knoxville and Nashville as the bottom-lands of the
Mississippi differ from the valleys of the Great Smoky Mountains. It is
the natural centre of the finest cotton-producing district in the
world, the county of Shelby, of which it is legally known as the Taxing
District, yielding more cotton than any other county in the Union
except that of Washington in Mississippi. It is almost as much aloof
politically from east and middle Tennessee as it is geographically. A
homogeneous State might be constructed by taking west Tennessee, all of
Mississippi above Vicksburg and Jackson, and a slice off Arkansas, with
Memphis for its capital. But the redistricting would be a good thing
neither for the States named nor for Memphis, for the more variety
within convenient limits a State can have, the better, and Memphis
could not wish a better or more distinguished destiny than to become the
commercial metropolis of a State of such great possibilities and varied
industries as Tennessee. Her political influence might be more decisive
in the homogeneous State outlined, but it will be abundant for all
reasonable ambition in its inevitable commercial importance. And
besides, the western part of the State needs the moral tonic of the more
elevated regions.

The city has a frontage of about four miles on the Mississippi River,
but is high above it on the Chickasaw Bluffs, with an uneven surface and
a rolling country back of it, the whole capable of perfect drainage.
Its site is the best on the river for a great city from St. Louis to the
Gulf; this advantage is emphasized by the concentration of railways
at this point, and the great bridge, which is now on the eve of
construction, to the Arkansas shore, no doubt fixes its destiny as
the inland metropolis of the South-west. Memphis was the child of the
Mississippi, and this powerful, wayward stream is still its fostering
mother, notwithstanding the decay of river commerce brought about by the
railways; for the river still asserts its power as a regulator of rates
of transportation. I do not mean to say that the freighting on it in
towed barges is not still enormous, but if it did not carry a pound
to the markets of the world it is still the friend of all the inner
continental regions, which says to the railroads, beyond a certain
rate of charges you shall not go. With this advantage of situation, the
natural receiver of the products of an inexhaustible agricultural region
(one has only to take a trip by rail through the Yazoo Valley to be
convinced of that), and an equally good point for distribution of
supplies, it is inevitable that Memphis should grow with an accelerating
impulse.

The city has had a singular and instructive history, and that she
has survived so many vicissitudes and calamities, and entered upon
an extraordinary career of prosperity, is sufficient evidence of the
territorial necessity of a large city just at this point on the river.
The student of social science will find in its history a striking
illustration of the relation of sound sanitary and business conditions
to order and morality. Before the war, and for some time after it,
Memphis was a place for trade in one staple, where fortunes were quickly
made and lost, where no attention was paid to sanitary laws. The cloud
of impending pestilence always hung over it, the yellow-fever was always
a possibility, and a devastating epidemic of it must inevitably be
reckoned with every few years. It seems to be a law of social life that
an epidemic, or the probability of it, engenders a recklessness of life
and a low condition of morals and public order. Memphis existed, so to
speak, on the edge of a volcano, and it cannot be denied that it had a
reputation for violence and disorder. While little or nothing was done
to make the city clean and habitable, or to beautify it, law was weak
in its mobile, excitable population, and differences of opinion were
settled by the revolver. In spite of these disadvantages, the profits of
trade were so great there that its population of twenty thousand at the
close of the war had doubled by 1878. In that year the yellow-fever came
as an epidemic, and so increased in 1879 as nearly to depopulate the
city; its population was reduced from nearly forty thousand to about
fourteen thousand, two-thirds of which were negroes; its commerce was
absolutely cut off, its manufactures were suspended, it was bankrupt.
There is nothing more unfortunate for a State or a city than loss of
financial credit. Memphis struggled in vain with its enormous debt,
unable to pay it, unable to compromise it.

Under these circumstances the city resorted to a novel expedient.
It surrendered its charter to the State, and ceased to exist as a
municipality. The leaders of this movement gave two reasons for it, the
wish not to repudiate the city debt, but to gain breathing-time, and
that municipal government in this country is a failure. The Legislature
erected the former Memphis into The Taxing District of Shelby County,
and provided a government for it. This government consists of a
Legislative Council of eight members, made up of the Board of Fire
and Police Commissioners, consisting of three, and the Board of Public
Works, consisting of five. These are all elected by popular vote to
serve a term of four years, but the elections are held every two years,
so that the council always contains members who have had experience. The
Board of Fire and Police Commissioners elects a President, who is the
executive officer of the Taxing District, and has the power and duties
of a mayor; he has a salary of $2000, inclusive of his fees as police
magistrate, and the other members of his board have salaries of $500.
The members of the Board of Public Works serve without compensation. No
man can be eligible to either board who has not been a resident of
the district for five years. In addition there is a Board of Health,
appointed by the council. This government has the ordinary powers of
a city government, defined carefully in the Act, but it cannot run the
city in debt, and it cannot appropriate the taxes collected except for
the specific purpose named by the State Legislature, which specific
appropriations are voted annually by the Legislature on the
recommendation of the council. Thus the government of the city is
committed to eight men, and the execution of its laws to one man, the
President of the Taxing District, who has extraordinary power. The final
success of this scheme will be watched with a great deal of interest
by other cities. On the surface it can be seen that it depends upon
securing a non-partisan council, and an honest, conscientious President
of the Taxing District—that is to say, upon the choice by popular vote
of the best eight men to rule the city. Up to this time, with only
slight hitches, it has worked exceedingly well, as will appear in a
consideration of the condition of the city. The slight hitch mentioned
was that the President was accused of using temporarily the sum
appropriated for one city purpose for another.

The Supreme Court of the United States decided that Memphis had not
evaded its obligations by a change of name and form of government. The
result was a settlement with the creditors at fifty cents on the dollar;
and then the city gathered itself together for a courageous effort and a
new era of prosperity. The turning-point in its career was the adoption
of a system of drainage and sewerage which transformed it immediately
into a fairly healthful city. With its uneven surface and abundance of
water at hand, it was well adapted to the Waring system, which works
to the satisfaction of all concerned, and since its introduction
the inhabitants are relieved from apprehension of the return of a
yellow-fever epidemic. Population and business returned with this sense
of security, and there has been a change in the social atmosphere
as well. In 1880 it had a population of less than 34,000; it can now
truthfully claim between 75,000 and 80,000; and the business activity,
the building both of fine business blocks and handsome private
residences, are proportioned to the increase in inhabitants. In 1879-80
the receipt of cotton was 409,809 bales, valued at $23,752,529; in
1886-87, 603,277 bales, valued at $30,099,510. The estimate of the Board
of Trade for 1888, judging from the first months of the year, is 700,000
bales. I notice in the comparative statement of leading articles of
commerce and consumption an exceedingly large increase in 1887 over
1886. The banking capital in 1887 was $3,300,000—an increase of
$1,560,000 over 1886. The clearings were $101,177,377 in 1877, against
$82,642,192 in 1880.

The traveller, however, does not need figures to convince him of the
business activity of the town; the piles of cotton beyond the capacity
of storage, the street traffic, the extension of streets and residences
far beyond the city limits, all speak of growth. There is in process of
construction a union station to accommodate the six railways now meeting
there and others projected. On the west of the river it has lines to
Kansas City and Little Rock and to St. Louis; on the east, to Louisville
and to the Atlantic seaboard direct, and two to New Orleans. With the
building of the bridge, which is expected to be constructed in a
couple of years, Memphis will be admirably supplied with transportation
facilities.

As to its external appearance, it must be said that the city has grown
so fast that city improvements do not keep pace with its assessable
value. The inability of the city to go into debt is a wholesome
provision, but under this limitation the city offices are shabby,
the city police quarters and court would disgrace an indigent country
village, and most of the streets are in bad condition for want of
pavement. There are fine streets, many attractive new residences, and
some fine old places, with great trees, and the gravelled pikes running
into the country are in fine condition, and are favorite drives. There
is a beautiful country round about, with some hills and pleasant
woods. Looked at from an elevation, the town is seen to cover a
large territory, and presents in the early green of spring a charming
appearance. Some five miles out is the Montgomery race-track, park,
and club-house—a handsome establishment, prettily laid out and planted,
already attractive, and sure to be notable when the trees are grown.

The city has a public-school system, a Board of Education elected by
popular vote, and divides its fund fairly between schools for white and
colored children. But it needs good school-houses as much as it needs
good pavements. In 1887 the tax of one and a half mills produced $54,000
for carrying on the schools, and $19,000 for the building fund. It was
not enough—at least $75,000 were needed. The schools were in debt. There
is a plan adopted for a fine High-school building, but the city needs
altogether more money and more energy for the public schools. According
to some reports the public schools have suffered from politics, and are
not as good as they were years ago, but they are undoubtedly gaining in
public favor, notwithstanding some remaining Bourbon prejudice against
them. The citizens are making money fast enough to begin to be liberal
in matters educational, which are only second to sanitary measures in
the well-being of the city. The new free Public Library, which will be
built and opened in a couple of years, will do much for the city in this
direction. It is the noble gift of the late F. H. Cossitt, of New York,
formerly a citizen of Memphis, who left $75,000 for that purpose.

Perhaps the public schools of Memphis would be better (though not so
without liberal endowment) if the city had not two exceptionally good
private schools for young ladies. These are the Clara Conway Institute
and the Higby School for Young Ladies, taking their names from their
principals and founders. Each of these schools has about 350 pupils,
from the age of six to the mature age of graduation, boys being admitted
until they are twelve years old. Each has pleasant grounds and fine
buildings, large, airy, well planned, with ample room for all the
departments—literature, science, art, music—of the most advanced
education. One finds in them the best methods of the best schools, and a
most admirable spirit. It is not too much to say that these schools
give distinction to Memphis, and that the discipline and intellectual
training the young ladies receive there will have a marked effect upon
the social life of the city. If one who spent some delightful hours in
the company of these graceful and enthusiastic scholars, and who would
like heartily to acknowledge their cordiality, and his appreciation of
their admirable progress in general study, might make a suggestion, it
would be that what the frank, impulsive Southern girl, with her inborn
talent for being agreeable and her vivid apprehension of life, needs
least of all is the cultivation of the emotional, the rhetorical, the
sentimental side. However cleverly they are done, the recitation of
poems of sentiment, of passion, of lovemaking and marriage, above all,
of those doubtful dialect verses in which a touch of pseudo-feeling
is supposed to excuse the slang of the street and the vulgarity of the
farm, is not an exercise elevating to the taste. I happen to speak of
it here, but I confess that it is only a text from which a little sermon
might be preached about “recitations” and declamations generally, in
these days of overdone dialect and innuendoes about the hypocrisy of
old-fashioned morality.

The city has a prosperous college of the Christian Brothers, another
excellent school for girls in the St. Agnes Academy, and a colored
industrial school, the Lemoyne, where the girls are taught cooking and
the art of house-keeping, and the boys learn carpentering. This does not
belong to the public-school system.

Whatever may be the opinion about the propriety of attaching industrial
training to public schools generally, there is no doubt that this sort
of training is indispensable to the colored people of the South, whose
children do not at present receive the needed domestic training at
borne, and whose education must contribute to their ability to earn
a living. Those educated in the schools, high and low, cannot all be
teachers or preachers, and they are not in the way of either social
elevation or thrifty lives if they have neither a trade nor the taste to
make neat and agreeable homes. The colored race cannot have it too often
impressed upon them that their way to all the rights and privileges
under a free government lies in industry, thrift, and morality. Whatever
reason they have to complain of remaining discrimination and prejudice,
there is only one way to overcome both, and that is by the acquisition
of property and intelligence. In the history of the world a people
were never elevated otherwise. No amount of legislation can do it. In
Memphis—in Southern cities generally—the public schools are impartially
administered as to the use of money for both races. In the country
districts they are as generally inadequate, both in quality and in the
length of the school year. In the country, where farming and domestic
service must be the occupations of the mass of the people, industrial
schools are certainly not called for; but in the cities they are a
necessity of the present development.

Ever since Memphis took itself in hand with a new kind of municipal
government, and made itself a healthful city, good-fortune of one kind
and another seems to have attended it. Abundant water it could get from
the river for sewerage purposes, but for other uses either extensive
filters were needed or cisterns were resorted to. The city was supplied
with water, which the stranger would hesitate to drink or bathe in, from
Wolf River, a small stream emptying into the Mississippi above the city.
But within the year a most important discovery has been made for
the health and prosperity of the town. This was the striking, in the
depression of the Gayoso Bayou, at a depth of 450 feet, perfectly
pure water, at a temperature of about 62°, in abundance, with a head
sufficient to bring it in fountains some feet about the level of the
ground. Ten wells had been sunk, and the water flowing was estimated at
ten millions of gallons daily, or half enough to supply the city. It
was expected that with more wells the supply would be sufficient for
all purposes, and then Memphis will have drinking water not excelled in
purity by that of any city in the land. It is not to be wondered at that
this incalculable good-fortune should add buoyancy to the business, and
even to the advance in the price, of real estate. The city has widely
outgrown its corporate limits, there is activity in building and
improvements in all the pleasant suburbs, and with the new pavements
which are in progress, the city will be as attractive as it is
prosperous.

Climate is much a matter of taste. The whole area of the alluvial land
of the Mississippi has the three requisites for malaria—heat, moisture,
and vegetable decomposition. The tendency to this is overcome, in a
measure, as the land is thoroughly drained and cultivated. Memphis has
a mild winter, long summer, and a considerable portion of the year
when the temperature is just about right for enjoyment. In the table
of temperature for 1887 I find that the mean was 61.9°, the mean of the
highest by months was 84.9°, and the mean lowest was 37.4°. The coldest
month was January, when the range of the thermometer was from 72.2° to
4.3°, and the hottest was July, when the range was from 99° to 67.30.
There is a preponderance of fair, sunny weather. The record for 1887
was: 157 days of clear, 132 fair, 65 cloudy, 91 days of frost. From this
it appears that Memphis has a pretty agreeable climate for those who do
not insist upon a good deal of “bracing,” and it has a most genial and
hospitable society.

Early on the morning of the 12th of April we crossed the river to the
lower landing of the Memphis and Little Rock Railway, the upper landing
being inaccessible on account of the high water. It was a delicious
spring morning, the foliage, half unfolded, was in its first flush of
green, and as we steamed down the stream the town, on bluffs forty feet
high, was seen to have a noble situation. All the opposite country for
forty miles from the river was afloat, and presented the appearance of
a vast swamp, not altogether unpleasing in its fresh dress of green. For
forty miles, to Madison, the road ran upon an embankment just above the
flood; at intervals were poor shanties and little cultivated patches,
but shanties, corn patches, and trees all stood in the water. The
inhabitants, the majority colored, seemed of the sort to be content with
half-amphibious lives. Before we reached Madison and crossed St. Francis
River we ran through a streak of gravel. Forest City, at the crossing of
the Iron Mountain Railway, turned out to be not exactly a city, in the
Eastern meaning of the word, but a considerable collection of
houses, with a large hotel. It seemed, so far in the wilderness, an
irresponsible sort of place, and the crowd at the station were in
a festive, hilarious mood. This was heightened by the playing of a
travelling band which we carried with us in the second-class car, and
which good-naturedly unlimbered at the stations. It consisted of a
colored bass-viol, violin, and guitar, and a white cornet. On the way
the negro population were in the majority, all the residences were
shabby shanties, and the moving public on the trains and about the
stations had not profited by the example of the commercial travellers,
who are the only smartly dressed people one sees in these regions.
A young girl who got into the car here told me that she came from
Marianna, a town to the south, on the Languille River, and she seemed
to regard it as a central place. At Brinkley we crossed the St. Louis,
Arkansas, and Texas road, ran through more swamps to the Cache River,
after which there was prairie and bottom-land, and at De Valle’s Bluff
we came to the White River. There is no doubt that this country is
well watered. After White River fine reaches of prairie-land were
encountered—in fact, a good deal of prairie and oak timber. Much of
this prairie had once been cultivated to cotton, but was now turned to
grazing, and dotted with cattle. A place named Prairie Centre had been
abandoned; indeed, we passed a good many abandoned houses before we
reached Carlisle and the Galloway. Lonoke is one of the villages of
rather mean appearance, but important enough to be talked about and
visited by the five aspirants for the gubernatorial nomination, who were
travelling about together, each one trying to convince the people that
the other four were unworthy the office. This is lowland Arkansas,
supporting a few rude villages, inhabited by negroes and unambitious
whites, and not a fairly representative portion of a great State.

At Argenta, a sort of railway and factory suburb of the city, we crossed
the muddy, strong-flowing Arkansas River on a fine bridge, elevated so
as to strike high up on the bluff on which Little Rock is built. The
rock of the bluff, which the railway pierces, is a very shaly slate. The
town lying along the bluff has a very picturesque appearance, in spite
of its newness and the poor color of its brick. The situation is a noble
one, commanding a fine prospect of river and plain, and mountains to the
west rising from the bluff on a series of gentle hills, with conspicuous
heights farther out for public institutions and country houses. The
eity, which has nearly thirty thousand inhabitants, can boast a number
of handsome business streets with good shops and an air of prosperous
trade, with well-shaded residence streets of comfortable houses; but
all the thoroughfares are bad for want of paving, Little Rock being
forbidden by the organic law ( as Memphis is ) to run in debt for city
improvements. A city which has doubled its population within eight
years, and been restrained from using its credit, must expect to suffer
from bad streets, but its caution about debt is reassuring to intending
settlers. The needed street improvements, it is understood, however,
will soon be under way, and the citizens have the satisfaction of
knowing that when they are made, Little Rock will be a beautiful city.

Below the second of the iron bridges which span the river is a bowlder
which gave the name of Little Rock to the town. The general impression
is that it is the first rock on the river above its confluence with
the Mississippi; this is not literally true, but this rock is the first
conspicuous one, and has become historic. On the opposite side of the
river, a mile above, is a bluff several hundred feet high, called Big
Rock. On the summit is a beautiful park, a vineyard, a summer hotel, and
pleasure-grounds—a delightful resort in the hot weather. From the top
one gains a fair idea of Arkansas—the rich delta of the river, the
mighty stream itself, the fertile rolling land and forests, the
mountains on the border of the Indian Territory, the fair city,
the sightly prominences about it dotted with buildings—altogether a
magnificent and most charming view.

There is a United States arsenal at Little Rock; the Government
Post-office is a handsome building, and among the twenty-seven churches
there are some of pleasing architecture. The State-house, which
stands upon the bluff overlooking the river, is a relic of old times,
suggesting the easy-going plantation style. It is an indescribable
building, or group of buildings, with classic pillars of course, and
rambling galleries that lead to old-fashioned, domestic-looking State
offices. It is shabby in appearance, but has a certain interior air of
comfort. The room of the Assembly—plain, with windows on three sides,
open to the sun and air, and not so large that conversational speaking
cannot be heard in it—is not at all the modern notion of a legislative
chamber, which ought to be lofty, magnificently decorated, lighted from
above, and shut in as much as possible from the air and the outside
world. Arkansas, which is rapidly growing in population and wealth, will
no doubt very soon want a new State-house. Heaven send it an architect
who will think first of the comfortable, cheerful rooms, and second
of imposing outside display! He might spend a couple of millions on
a building which would astonish the natives, and not give them as
agreeable a working room for the Legislature as this old chamber. The
fashion is to put up an edifice whose dimensions shall somehow represent
the dignity of the State, a vast structure of hall-ways and staircases,
with half-lighted and ill-ventilated rooms. It seems to me that the
American genius ought to be able to devise a capitol of a different
sort, certainly one better adapted to the Southern climate. A group of
connected buildings for the various departments might be better than
one solid parallelogram, and I have a fancy that legislators would be
clearer-headed, and would profit more by discussion, if they sat in a
cheerful chamber, not too large to be easily heard in, and open as much
as possible to the sun and air and the sight of tranquil nature. The
present Capitol has an air of lazy neglect, and the law library which
is stored in it could not well be in a worse condition; but there is
something rather pleasing about the old, easy-going establishment that
one would pretty certainly miss in a smart new building. Arkansas has an
opportunity to distinguish itself by a new departure in State-houses.

In the city are several of the State institutions, most of them
occupying ample grounds with fine sites in the suburbs. Conspicuous
on high ground in the city is the Blind Asylum, a very commodious,
and well-conducted institution, with about 80 inmates. The School
for Deaf-mutes, with 125 pupils, is under very able management. But I
confess that the State Lunatic Asylum gave me a genuine surprise, and if
the civilization of Arkansas were to be judged by it, it would take high
rank among the States. It is a very fine building, well constructed and
admirably planned, on a site commanding a noble view, with eighty
acres of forest and garden. More land is needed to carry out the
superintendent’s idea of labor, and to furnish supplies for the
patients, of whom there are 450, the men and women, colored and white,
in separate wings. The builders seem to have taken advantage of all the
Eastern experience and shunned the Eastern mistakes, and the result
is an establishment with all the modern improvements and conveniences,
conducted in the most enlightened spirit. I do not know a better large
State asylum in the United States. Of the State penitentiary nothing
good can be said. Arkansas is still struggling with the wretched lease
system, the frightful abuses of which she is beginning to appreciate.
The penitentiary is a sort of depot for convicts, who are distributed
about the State by the contractors. At the time of my visit a
considerable number were there, more or less crippled and sick, who had
been rescued from barbarous treatment in one of the mines. A gang were
breaking stones in the yard, a few were making cigars, and the dozen
women in the women’s ward were doing laundry-work. But nothing appeared
to be done to improve the condition of the inmates. In Southern prisons
I notice comparatively few of the “professional” class which so largely
make the population of Northern penitentiaries, and I always fancy that
in the rather easy-going management, wanting the cast-iron discipline,
the lot of the prisoners is not so hard. Thus far among the colored
people not much odium attaches to one of their race who has been in
prison.

The public-school system of the State is slowly improving, hampered
by want of Constitutional power to raise money for the schools. By the
Constitution, State taxes are limited to one per cent.; county taxes to
one-half of one per cent., with an addition of one-half of one per cent,
to pay debts existing when the Constitution was adopted in 1874;
city taxes the same as county; in addition, for the support of common
schools, the Assembly may lay a tax not to exceed two mills on the
dollar on the taxable property of the State, and an annual per capita
tax of one dollar on every male inhabitant over the age of twenty-one
years; and it may also authorize each school district to raise for
itself, by vote of its electors, a tax for school purposes not to exceed
five mills on the dollar. The towns generally vote this additional tax,
but in most of the country districts schools are not maintained for
more than three months in the year. The population of the State is about
1,000,000, in an area of 53,045 square miles. The scholastic population
enrolled has increased steadily for several years, and in 1886 was
164,757, of which 122,296 were white and 42,461 were colored. The total
population of school age (including the enrolled) was 358,006, of which
266,188 were white and 91,818 colored. The school fund available for
that year was $1,327,710. The increased revenue and enrolment are
encouraging, but it is admitted that the schools of the State (sparsely
settled as it is) cannot be what they should be without more money to
build decent school-houses, employ competent teachers, and have longer
sessions.

Little Rock has fourteen school-houses, only one or two of which are
commendable-The High-school, with 50 pupils and 2 teachers, is held in
a district building. The colored people have their fair proportion of
schools, with teachers of their own race. Little Rock is abundantly able
to tax itself for better schools, as it is for better pavements. In all
the schools most attention seems to be paid to mathematics, and it is
noticeable how proficient colored children under twelve are in figures.

The most important school in the State, which I did not see, is the
Industrial University at Fayetteville, which received the Congressional
land grant and is a State beneficiary; its property, including
endowments and the University farm, is reckoned at $300,000. The general
intention is to give a practical industrial education. The collegiate
department, a course of three years, has 77 pupils; in the preparatory
department are about 200; but the catalogue, including special students
in art and music, the medical department at Little Rock of 60, and the
Normal School at Pine Bluff of 215, foots up about 600 students. The
University is situated in a part of the State most attractive in its
scenery and most healthful, and offers a chance for every sort of mental
