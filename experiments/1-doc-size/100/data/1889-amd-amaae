Her efforts, I resolved, should not shame mine. 
And, as spring advanced, I came to the conclusion 
that there were few places more beautiful than 
Athens. The long, gradual swell of land up to the 
highest point, broken here and there abruptly, as 
well as in a picturesque manner, clothed with 
verdure in the innumerable shades of tender green. 
The river winding along, a blue ribbon under the 
skies of faultless blue. The ascent on the other side 
dotted with little hamlets, for they could hardly 
be called towns, and here and there a handsome 
residence perched on some eminence like a castle. 
The fresh, balmy air, the grassy fragrance, the twit 
ter of birds, the long, tender notes of the wood-robin, 
filled my soul with a peaceful exaltation. It was as if 
I had come out of a confused, hurrying struggle, and 
just begun to live. Indeed, I had secured time to live. 
It might be dull if one had no resource but a small rail 
road station, and no companion : I had both. What 
wonderful pictures Eve and I studied in our walks, 
what tones of color, what tenderness and breadth ! 

"It makes me wild to paint something higher than 
flowers," said Eve longingly. "I wish I had some 
friend who was a true artist, who could feel and see 
and worship ; and I should ask her to come and stay 
weeks with me." 



 



CHAPTER VII 

JOE'S FALL FKOM GRACE 

EVE went to New York for the day. Joe and 
I worked steadily all the morning ; and after lunch, I 
sent him down-town, as the business part of Athens 
was called. He was to leave a message with Pryor 
also. 

After an hour or so I began to wonder why he did 
not return. I went up to the house, but he was not 
there ; busied myself a while, then came down at four, 
as an up and a down train passed about that time. 
No Joe yet. It seemed odd: then I bethought 
myself that he might have gone riding with Pryor. 

At five he came sauntering up on the platform. I 
knew in a moment what had happened. I was hurt 
and mortified. I had made no comments on Joe's 
unfortunate weakness; and it seemed unpardonable 
in him, under the circumstances, to drink at some 
other person's expense, to bruit abroad the secret I 
had kept. 

He delivered his message in a voice that was a 
little thick, and his eyes avoided mine. 



 

"Joe," I said, "you have been drinking. How 
could you?" 

He turned and straightened himself, as if to brave 
it out, then suddenly collapsed. 

" O Thurston ! " he cried, " I'm a fool, a beast ! 
And when you've been so kind, and I resolved I'd 
never touch another drop ! Shake me off, and let 
me go to ruin ! I'm not worth saving." 

Those few words, "let me go to ruin," pierced 
me to the quick, though he had not uttered them 
upbraidingly. In that great bond of human brother 
hood I was in some degree answerable for him. I 
went and put my arm over his shoulder, and drew 
him into the office. Then he broke down and cried, 
as a half-drunken man is very apt to do. 

"I shall not shake you off without another 
chance," I said quietly. " But I am so hurt ! You 
might have cared more for me and my sister." 

He started up. " Let me go somewhere and hide. 
I'm not fit to meet her sweet eyes. O Thurston ! 
what devil did possess me ? I'm fated. There's no 
use trying. I've signed the pledge three times, and 
that doesn't help."
