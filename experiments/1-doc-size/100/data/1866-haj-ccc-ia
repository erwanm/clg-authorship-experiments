" I do not." 

" And the reason ? " 

" Is simply this. The boy's mother jilted me, or 



 



 

rather refhsed me outright when I offered my hand ia 
marriage." 

'' Ha, that's where the shoe pinches.'' 

"You are right.'' 

" Well, I don't care to interfere with any little private 
revenge you may desire to take, as long as it chimes in 
with my own purposes. The boy shall be flogged if you 
wish it." 

"I do." 

" Find some pretext then, as long as the charge of 
robJ)ery won't serve." 

"Then," said Randall, "you might announce that, 
although the charge of thefb had not been sustained, he 
had been guilty of an offence that called for punishment 
— insolence to his officers." 

" That is a good idea. And in regard to Antonio——'' 

"I have no doubt the rascal stole' the ring, and de' 
jserves punishment, but I don't want him flogged, as it 
would gratify Sturdy too much."  

" My own feeling." 

" Tou can say that you have been unable to determine 
who is guilty in the matter, and shall wait for fbrtheir 
evidence." 

" Very well conceived, Mr. Randall. I shall follow 
your advice, and thank you for it' 

" I am glad to have been of service to you, Captain 
Brace." 

" And now, Mr. Randall, if you will go on deck, I 
will be up presently."'' 

The mate reappeared on deck with a satisfied afr, occasionally looking with a glance of triumphant spite at 



 

Charlie, who was standing beside his tried and trusty 
friend, Bill Sturdy. 

" You don't know what's in store for you, my lad," be 
muttered. " Pity his mother could not be here to see 
his fair flesh quivering under the keen lash. Her heart 
would feel every stroke. She might repent, then, the 
scorn with which she repelled the suit of John Randall. 
How I hate that boy ! He brings up his father before 
me. So much the better. When he shrinks beneath the 
lash, I shall think it is my old rival upon whom it is 
falling." 

Bill Sturdy, meanwhile, said in a low voice to Charlie, 
" I don't like the looks of the mate this morning. He's 
batching mischief of some, kind, if I'm not greatly 
mistaken." 

"Against us?" 

" Tiiat's what I'mistrust, my lad ; against one or both 
of us. He hates us both, and I ain't quite sure which 
he hates 4ihe most." 

" And yet I never did him any injury." 

"Then he's done you some harm, depend upon it. 
People hate worst those they have injured most, and he's 
done you a great wrong in stealing you from home." 

" What do you suppose made him do that. Bill ? " 

" He had some private reason ; there ain't a question 
about that. It wasn't because we were in want of a boy. 
We might haVfe picked up plenty that would have been 
glad to come."
