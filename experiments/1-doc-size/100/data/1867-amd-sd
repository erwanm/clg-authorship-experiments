" Company, I b'lieve. Jake Fawcett's wife told me. 
They want Mr. Vennard to go look at it first. Cu'ris 
that nothin' can't be done a'thout he has a finger in 
the pie." 

Stephen was too much excited to notice Joe's elisions. 
He choked down a mouthful of the johnny-cake. For 
all taste it had to him, it might as well have been 



 

compounded of chaff. This errand was what had called 
Mr. Vennard to that fatal spot. But his father 
How solve the mystery? 

"You're stupid to-night, Stephen," Joe said, angrily. 
" One might as well talk to a stick." 

" Am I ? " His voice had a dreary patience in it, as 
if he had begun to wait for something that would never 
come. He sipped his tea with long breaths between. 
When Joe was not looking he flung portions of his 
supper to the wistful-eyed dog. Presently he rose. 

" I do wish father 'd come. Goin' out again ? " 

"No." 

Then Joe, having failed in all her efforts at conversa- 
tion, lapsed into sullen silence. Stephen seated himself 
on the window-ledge, and looked down the lane. 

Nothing came of his watching. Gray night closed 
them in. One by one the stars were set in pale, 
penetrable wreaths of fleecy clouds. The surge of the 
river floated upon the night air, bringing wafts of dewy 
fragrance. Joe went out to gossip with a neighbor. 
In that strange, still night, Stephen's thoughts whirled 
in wildest chaos. It was his misery that nothing could 
be done. No plans laid. No precautions taken. Some 
times he resolved to go away without any explanation, 
but he shivered at the suspicion it might arouse. Had 
any one heard the words that had passed between him 
and Mr. Vennard? There was a long afternoon 
to account for. And here in his pocket was the 





memorandum-book. What must he do with that ? If 
found in this house, father or son must answer for the 
deed. 

He lighted a candle, and went up to his room, fas- 
tening the door behind him. Then he drew forth the 
book and opened it. Full of daily jottings in pencil, 
one or two receipts, a plan for boiler and steam-chest, 
and some bank bills, laid out straight, with a crisp, 
fresh look, although not new. Six fifties and ten 
twenties five hundred dollars ! 

This was what had tempted his old father. This 
was what he had gone back to search for. A few 
hours agone Stephen had been wishing for just this. 
It would give him the means to perfect his engine, start 
him on the road to fortune. Ah, if it were only his, 
with no stain of blood upon it !

He put the money back, and shut the book. What 
should he do with it? hold it there in the flame until 
it was all consumed? Or, better still, take it down 
stairs and lay it upon the coals ? Destroy this sure and 
fatal evidence. 

But the money ? 

He had not robbed; he had not but a shiver 
choked off the words. Still, why should the money be 
wasted ? More than this had Thomas Vennard wrung 
out of his workmen. Mrs. Vennard and the child 
would have an' abundance. Little sunny-haired Hope ! 

Yes, it would do so much for him ; give him the 



 

knowledge for which he was madly thirsting ; save them 
all, perhaps ; take them out of this homblc, grovelling 
life. It had come to him by one of those blind chances 
of fate. Was it best to destroy it ? 

He stood there a long while, with a devil at his el- 
bow. To send it back in any manner would be certain 
detection. Was he not answerable for his father's life? 
No, it could not be returned.
