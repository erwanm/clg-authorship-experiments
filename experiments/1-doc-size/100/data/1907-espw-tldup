But the dog was not there. Slightly startled, 
Carolyn ran out into the storm, and down the 
terrace, against which the horse had driven one 
wheel of the buggy. This, obstructed by a bush, 
had stuck in the soaked grass. The buggy, which 
a less conscientious horse would have overturned, 
was empty. 

Mrs. Dane clambered over the wheel and drove 
on to the stable. Her first impulse to drive in 
search of her husband had given place to a cold 
and sickening prudence. Without exactly knowing 
why, she thought she had better not assume that 
there had been an accident — not yet ; not too 
soon. 

She ran into the house for her raincoat, came 
out again, went a little way down the sidewalk, and 
scrutinized the storm-beaten road. It was quite de- 
serted. She walked on hurriedly, going faster and 
further than she knew, until she came to the choco- 
late eclair house, where Nannie was lighting the 
gas and drawing the shades. At this point Mrs. 
Dane turned about and came back. She now re- 
membered that Solomon Hops had one of his per- 
sonally conducted rheumatic attacks. These were 
more strenuous than dangerous, and she felt sure 
that the doctor had made this call the last on his 
rounds on his way home. Whatever had happened, 
horse and driver had separated somewhere be- 

 



tween the two houses. Now, she reasoned (more 
calmly than most young wives would), the chances 
were that her husband would be at home before 
her. Her steps quickened to a run. When she 
came opposite the Sterling place, her old home, 
her dog leaped out upon her ; whining and bark- 
ing, he urged her across the street. Against one 
of the great stone pillars which guarded the en- 
trance to the avenue, the figure of a man leaned 
heavily; his crushed felt hat slouched over his face, 
and his head fell forward upon his breast. Clyde 
put his fore paws dutifully, rather than 
affectionately, about the man's waist, and seemed to make 
something like an effort to support him, until Mrs. 
Dane had reached the spot. 

" Oh, are you hurt ? " she cried. Her wet hand 
slid into her husband's. He pushed it off. 

"Where is that horse?" he snarled. "He dragged 
his weight and came home without me. My foot 
caught in the reins somehow, and I had a nasty 
tumble. Solomon will talk about his symptoms all 
night. Only way I can stop him is to put a 
thermometer in his mouth. What are you here for, 
anyhow ? Pity there wasn't an accident. It would 
have given you something to fuss about." 

Carolyn made no answer. She helped him up the 
steps and into the cottage hall, where he stood with 
sodden and evading eyes. She took off his wet coat 



and led him into his office. Neither spoke, and he 
sank down heavily into the office chair. 

" I will bring you a cup of coffee," she said, strug- 
gling for composure ; but her voice shook. It took 
a little time to make the coffee, and the Irish maid 
of all work fretted about it all the while. When 
Mrs. Dane came back to the office she found the 
doctor stretched on the lounge, past speech or 
motion, as unconscious of her presence as he was 
of his disgrace. In all her sheltered life Carolyn 
had never been so near a drunken man. She bent 
over him and touched his reddened cheek with her 
light, white fingers. 

" Dear," she said, " are you sick ? Oh, what can 
I do for you ? Chanceford ! Chanceford ! " 

At this moment the child across the hall waked 
and began to laugh, and then to call : " Mum — 
mumma ? Pup — puppa ? Puppa ? " 

Carolyn stood for a moment irresolute, and then 
she turned away and shut the office door. She 
took the baby, and sat down with him beside the 
cheerless register, and stared at the window where 
the storm was raging. Beyond the anger of the rain 
and wind she could hear the sea upon the cliff — 
the old familiar, mighty roar, mastering every lesser
