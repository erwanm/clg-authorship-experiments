had set our faces against that. Some one must yield, 
and the Welsh Power could not; it was not in her 
nature. We were therefore in a manner expelled from 
Aberystwyth, but our banishment was not from all 
Wales, and this was how we went next to Llandudno. 





FROISSART'S saying, if it was Froissart's, that the 
English amuse themselves sadly antedates that notion 
of Merry England which is now generally rejected by 
serious observers. I should myself prefer the agnostic 
position, and say that I did not know whether the Eng- 
lish were glad or not when they looked gay. What I 
seem to be certain of, but I do not say that I am cer- 
tain, is that they look gayer in their places of amuse- 
ment than we do. I do not mean theatres, or parlia- 
ments, or music-halls, or lecture-rooms, by places of 
amusement, but what we call summer resorts a little 
more largely than those resorts which the English call 
watering-places. Of these I should like to take as a 
type the charming summer resort on the coast of North 
Wales which is called Llandudno in print, and in speech 
several different ways. 



The English simply and frankly, after their blunt 
nature, call the place Landudno, but the Welsh call it, 
according to one superstition of their double I and their 
French u, Thlandidno. According to another, we cannot 
spell it in English at all ; but it does not much matter, 
for the last superstition is the ever-delightful but ever- 
doubtful George Sorrow's, who says that the Welsh 

II is tlie same as the Spanish II, but who is probably 
mistaken, most other authorities agreeing that if you 
pronounce it thl you will come as near it as any Sae- 
seneg need. It is a constantly besetting question in 
Wales, where the prefix Llan speckles the map all 
over, owing to that multitude of Saints who peopled 
the country in the times when a Saint's sons were every 
one saints, and none was of particularly holy, or even 
good life, because he was known for a saint. Like a 
continental noble, he inherited his title equally with all 
his brothers. 

But through whatever orthoepic mazes you search it, 
Llandudno has every claim on your regard and admira- 
tion. Like Aberystwyth, its sea front is a shallow 
crescent, but vaster, with a larger town expanding 
back of it, and with loftier and sublimer headlands, 
at either end, closing it in a more symmetrical frame. 
But I should say that its sea was not so blue, or its sky 
either, and its air was not so soft or dry. Morally it 
is more constantly lively, with a greater and more in- 
sistent variety of entertainments. For the American 
its appeal might well have begun with the sight of his 
country's flag floating over a tennis - ground at the 
neighboring watering-place and purer Welsh town of 
Rhyl. The approach to his affections was confirmed 
by another American flag displayed before one of the- 
chief hotels in Llandudno itself. I learned afterward 
of the landlord that this was because there were sev- 
eral Chicago families in his house, and fifteen Amer- 
icans in all ; but why the tennis-ground of Rhyl flew 
our national banner, I do not know to this day. It was 
indeed that gentle moment when our innocent people 
believed themselves peculiarly dear to the English, and 
might naturally suppose, if from Chicago, or Boston, 
or Denver, that the English would wish to see as often 

 

as possible the symbol of our successful revolt from the 
princes and principles to which they have religiously 
adhered. 

Both that home of the patriotic Chicago families, 
and the other best hotel were too full for us, and after 
a round of the second-best we decided for lodgings, 
hoping as usual that they would bring us nearer the 
native life. The best we could get, facing the sea mid- 
way of the crescent, were not exactly Welsh in their 
keeping. The landladies were, in fact, two elderly 
Church - of - England sisters from Dublin, who had 
named their house out of a novel they had read. 
They said they believed the name was Italian, and 
the reader shall judge if it were so from its analogue 
of Osier Wood. The maids in the house, however, were 
very truly and very wickedly Welsh: two tough little 
ponies of girls, who tied their hair up with shoe-strings, 
and were forbidden, when about their work, to talk 
Welsh together, lest they should speak lezing of those 
Irish ladies. The rogues were half English, but the 
gentle creature who served our table was wholly Welsh ; 
small, sweet-voiced, dark-eyed, intelligent, who suffered 
from the universal rheumatism of the British Isles, but
