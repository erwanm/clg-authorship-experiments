distance silent and with his eyes upon the ground. 

" By George, Hiram !" he exclaimed, at last, lifting 
his eyes and looking at me with a new and excited 
expression on his face ; " that fellow has put a new 
idea into my head. He isn 't the poor tool we all 
thought him." 

" A penny for your thoughts," said I, laughing. 

" A gold eagle wouldn 't buy them, if that were to 
lose them," he answered,with a strange earnestness of 
manner that surprised me. Then the new idea dawned 
upon my own mind. I understood what he meant 

" It 's a blamed sight easier than work, Hiram." 

" Drawing beer and mixing punches and cock 
tails ?" I queried. 

" Yes, and pays better," he said, with emphasis. I 
could feel in his voice the thrill of an unusual excite- 





ment. The blood was warming up his cold face. 
Light glittered in his eyes. 

" Not a very reputable sort of business," I rejoined. 

" Reputable ! Faugh ! It pays, and if you have 
money, you re reputable enough. A fig for all that !" 
and he snapped his fingers sharply. " Who cares 
for me now? Is Tom Lloyd anybody? Nothing 
but a poor miserable hack trying to keep soul and 
body together. If I were to fall sick to-morrow, 
who would look after me and the children? No 
body ! We 'd be packed off to the almshouse. Rep 
utable !" 

As he said this a handsome phaeton with two fine 
horses went dashing by. 

" Do you know that party ?" he asked, flinging out 
his arm in an elated manner. 

" No," I replied. 

" Billy Logan and his two daughters. Billy keeps 
the Logan House in Briar street. Six years ago 
he peddled stationery, but that sort of thing was too 
slow for him, so he set up a bar in a small way. I 
don 't  believe he had ten dollars worth of liquor in 
his shop when he opened. You see what he is now." 

I was beginning to feel interested. A poor ped 
dler transformed in six years to a gentleman sitting 
in his elegant phaeton behind a span of spanking 
black horses! 

There was no such luck for a poor journeyman 
bookbinder. A feeling of envy and dissatisfaction 
crept into my soul. 



 

" That 's respectability, you see," Lloyd went on. 
" Money 's the go ; people don 't  ask how you make 
it. All right if you have it, and the more you get 
to spend and splurge on, the more respectable you 
are. It 's the way of things in this world. Do you 
see that elegant house over yonder? Splendid 
enough for a prince." 

" Yes." 

" Well, do you know who lives there ? I can tell 
you : that house belongs to Hart Hartley, Esq. He 
made all his money by liquor not by selling it glass 
by ,glass over a counter to Tom, Dick and Harry. 
He isn 't one of your John Glums and Billy Logans, 
but a manufacturer and wholesale dealer. Why, it 
is said that he furnishes liquor to half the saloons in 
our city, and piles up his hundred thousand dollars 
every year. Now, figure me out this, Hiram Jones : 
what makes Hart Hartley 's business more respect 
able than John Glum 's ? If there is anything dis 
reputable in selling a glass of beer or whisky for 
one man to drink, is it any the less disreputable to 
sell a keg or barrel for a hundred or a thousand men 
to drink ? Maybe you can see the difference, but 
my head isn 't clear enough." 

I was a great deal more interested in what Lloyd 
was saying than I affected to be. A new line of 
thought had been opened, and my mind was busy
