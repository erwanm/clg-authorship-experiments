and he gave a short laugh. "And we can never 
set the world straight. But these Homes and 
Republics are doing a good work in training 
children to self reliance.” 

Jane wrapped the little girl in the kimona and 
lifted her up in the reclining chair. 



"Oh, that's so nice. How good you are! 
And everything is so lovely. Oh, I'll soon be 
well." 

Then the little face clouded over. Oh, she 
truly would not mind being ill if she could 
stay in this beautiful house where everything 
was so quiet. Jane went in and out, and pres- 
ently she brought a cup of broth. How good 
it tasted! 

'Would you mind if I went back to bed? 
I'm so sleepy." 

"Oh, no," returned Jane, and she put her 
gently back on the cot where she soon fell 
asleep. 

There was slight rise of fever and restless- 
ness about noon. She talked in broken 
snatches imploring Jack not to do this or that 
and not to pinch the babies. Then she was 
so tired, so tired! But about midafternoon, 
she seemed to rouse and come to herself and 
said she was hungry. There was broth and 
hot milk and some stewed fruit, and Jane 
brushed her hair that fell in a bed of rings 
and asked if she didn't want to sit up. She 
brought her over by the window so she could 





look out, but the back yard was very pretty 
for it was gay with blooming flowers. 

Miss Armitage had been to church, and at 
two she had a class of young girls who were 
clerks in stores. Half of them were going away 
on Monday to the Rest House for a week, and 
they were full of that. Two of them had never 
been before. Was it like Coney Island? 

'It is not far from the shore, the broad Sound 
that leads out to the ocean. But there are 
not side shows. Just rowing and bathing, and 
a ride every day in a big omnibus. And plenty 
of girls. Oh, you won't be lonseome;’ and 
Miss Armitage smiled. 

"Another girl and I went away last sum- 
mer to a house that wasn’t country but a 
beautiful street with lawns in front. There 
were three ladies, and oh, they were so par- 
ticular. They did not have any story papers 
and the books were all dull and religious and 
if you took up one you must put it back in 
the same place. They didn’t like us to talk 
store’ nor sing any street songs and one lady 
only played hymns on the piano. Oh, we were 
so homesick.” 

The Rest House has a big farm and chick- 



ens and two cows, and a tennis court and cro- 
quet. And there are lovely walks. And 
hammocks and swings. 

"That's the ticket!’ said one of the girls. 
‘You want some fun.’ 

Miss Armitage did not check her. She 
thought of the amusements and pleasures of 
her youth. Then she came home to her 
little girl whose face lighted up with gladness, 
and who put out her thin hand. 

"You look lovely," Marilla said. "And 
I'm getting almost well." 

"That is good news,'’ and the lady smiled. 
"Only it seems so queer when I try to think. 
It is such a long while. I seem to have been 
lost and couldn't find my way out. Do you 
know where the babies are?" 

"They all went down to Long Island. I
