" Why we have been to the Sunday school 
meeting, mamma." 

" I know that ; and it was not a night fit 
for you to go. What ever possessed you and 
Maria ? " remarked one of the sisters. 

" Why, Mr. Richmond wanted to see all the 
Sunday School," said Matilda thoughtfully. 
"He wanted you too, I suppose; and you 
were not there." 

" There is no use in having a meeting such a 
night. Of course, a great many people could 
not be there. It ought to have been put off." 

" Well, it was not put off," said Matilda. 

"What did he want? What was Maria 
talking about?" 

" She is the best one to ask," said the child. 
At the same moment Maria came in from 



 

getting rid of the snow, and enquired if Tilly 
had told them everything ? Finding all was 
right, she sat down contentedly before the fire 
and stretched out her feet towards it 

" We've had a splendid time, I can tell you," 
she began. 

" What was done in particular ? " asked one 
of the older girls, who was making a bonnet. 
"More than usual?" 

A great many things in particular, and one 
in general. We've made a Band." 

" I have made several since you have been 
away," the other sister remarked. 

" You know we cannot understand that 
unless you explain," said the bonnet-maker. 

" You must let Maria take her own man- 
ner," said their mother. 

WeU now I'll tell you all about it," said 
Maria. " There weren't a great many people 
there, to begin with." 

" Of course not ! such a night." 

" So there were plenty of empty benches, 
and it didn't look like a meeting at all, at first ; 




and I wondered if it would come to anything ; 
but then Mr. Richmond came in, and I saw 
Tie meant something." 

" Mr. Richmond always does mean some- 
thing," interrupted Matilda. 

" You hush, Tilly. Well, there were prayers 
first, of course ; and then Mr. Richmond stood 
up in the aisle and said he wanted to know 
how many of us all there were willing to be 
really good." 

The servants of Christ, he said," Matilda 
explained. 

" Yes, the servants of Christ, of course ; and 
he said he didn't know any better way to get 
at it than that we should all stand up." 

A burst of laughter from all Maria's audience a little confused her. Only Matilda 
looked gravely at her sister, as if she were 
making bad work of it. Maria coloured, 
stammered, and began again. 

" You all know what I mean ! You know 
what I mean, mamma. Mr. Richmond did 
not say that we should all stand up." 




" Then why did you say it ? " 

" I thought you would understand. He said 
that all those should stand up, so that he might
