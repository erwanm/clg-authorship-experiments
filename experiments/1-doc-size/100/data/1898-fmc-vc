to the ring in the wall by one of those rude iron pad- 
locks which had been used in Asia since the times of 
Alexander. Gilbert had heard wonderful tales of the 





gardens at Constantinople, and he resented the idea of 
being so near them and yet so effectually excluded. 
He tried to wrench the boat's chain from the bows, 
and, failing, he tried to force the lock, but the iron was 
solid and the lock was good; moreover, the chain was 
too short to allow the skiff to float to the end of the 
wall, if he had launched it. The idea of seeing into 
the garden became a determination as soon as he 
found that there were serious obstacles in the way, 
and by the time he had persuaded himself that the 
boat could not help him he would have readily risked 
life and limb for his fancy. A few moments' reflec- 
tion showed him, however, that there need be no great 
danger in the undertaking, for the defence had a weak 
point. The foundations on' which the walls stood 
were above water by several inches and were wide 
enough to give him a foothold if he could only keep 
himself upright against the flat surface. The latter 
difficulty could easily be overcome by using one of 
the oars from the boat, and he began to attempt the 
passage at once, cautiously putting one foot before 
the other and steadying himself with the oar against 
the opposite wall. It did not occur to him that to 
get into the Emperor's gardens by stealth might be 
looked upon as a serious matter. In a few moments 
he had reached the end and was getting back to the 
land on the other side. 

From the water's edge three little terraces led up 
like steps to the level of the garden, where the trees 
grew thick and dark ; and, although it was early 
autumn, each terrace was covered with flowers of a 
differeut hue â€” pink and soft yellow and pale blue. 



 

Gilbert had never seen anything made to grow in 
such orderly profusion, and when he reached the top 
by narrow steps built against the wall, he found him- 
self treading on a fine white gravel surface on which 
not even a single dead leaf had been allowed to lie, 
and which extended some thirty yards inwards under 
the trees to a straight bank of moss that had a sheen 
like green velvet where the sun fell upon it through 
the parted leaves overhead. Very far away between 
the trunks of the trees there was the gleam of white 
marble walls. 

Gilbert hesitated a little, and then walked slowly 
forward toward the bank. As yet he had seen no 
trace of any living thing in the garden, but as he 
advanced and changed his position he noticed a small 
dash of colour, like the corner of a dark blue cloak, 
beside the trunk of one of the larger trees. Some one 
was sitting on the other side, and he moved cau- 
tiously and almost noiselessly till he saw that the 
person was a lady, seated on the ground and absorbed 
in a book. He did not remember to have seen more 
than two or three women reading in all his life, 
and one of them was Queen Eleanor; another was 
Beatrix, who, as a lonely child in the solitude 
of her father's castle, had acquired some learning 
from the chaplain, and delighted in spelling out the 
few manuscripts in her father's possession. 

Gilbert Warde was as much a born sportsman as 
he was a fighter, and he had stalked the fallow-deer 
in Stortford woods since he had been old enough to 
draw an arrow's head to his finger. 

Step by step, from tree to tree, with cat-like tread, 





he came nearer, amused by an almost boyish pleasure 
in his own skill. Once the lady moved, but she 
looked in the opposite direction, and then at last, 
when he was within a dozen yards of her, half- 
sheltered by a slender stem, she looked straight across 
toward him, and the light fell upon her face. He 
knew that she saw him, but he could not have moved 
from the spot if it had been to save his life, for the 
lady was Beatrix herself. In spite of a separation 
that had lasted two years, in spite of her final growth 
out of early girlhood, he knew that he was not mis- 
taken, and her dark eyes were looking straight into 
his, telling him that she knew him, too. There was 
no fear in them, and she showed no surprise, but as
