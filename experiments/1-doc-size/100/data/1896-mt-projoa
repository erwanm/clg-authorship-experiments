terrors. I believed she so feared that one that with her 
strong will she would shut the thought of it wholly out 
of her mind, and hope and believe that God would take 
pity on her and grant her an easier one ; and so it might 
chance that the awful news which we were bringing might 
come as a surprise to her at last. 

We stood silent awhile, but she was still unconscious 
of us, still deep in her sad musings and far away. Then 
Martin Ladvenu said, softly — 

'Joan.' 

She looked up then, with a little start and a wan smile, 
and said — - 

' Speak. Have you a message for me ? ' tP 



' Yes, my poor child. Try to bear it. Do you think 
you can bear it ? ' 

' Yes ' — very softly, and her head drooped again. 

' I am come to prepare you for death.' 

A faint shiver trembled through her wasted body. 
There was a pause. In the stillness we could hear oui 
breathings. Then she said, still in that low voice — 

' When will it be ? ' 

The muffled notes of a tolling bell floated to our ears 
out of the distance. 

' Now. The time is at hand.' 

That slight shiver passed again. 

' It is so soon — ah, it is so soon ! ' 

There was a long silence. The distant throbbings of 
the bell pulsed through it, and we stood motionless and 
listening. But it was broken at last — 

' What death is it ? ' 

' By fire ! ' 

' Oh, I knew it, I knew it ! ' She sprang wildly to her 
feet, and wound her hands in her hair, and began to 
writhe and sob, oh, so piteously, and mourn and grieve 
and lament, and turn to first one and then another of us, 
and search our faces beseechingly, as hoping she might 
find help and friendliness there, poor thing — she that had 
never denied these to any creature, even her wounded 
enemy on the battle-field. 

' Oh, cruel, cruel, to treat me so ! And must my body, 
that has never been defiled, be consumed to-day and 
turned to ashes ? Ah, sooner would I that my head were 
cut off seven times than suffer this woeful death. I had 
the promise of the Church's prison when I submitted, and 
if I had but been there, and not left here in the hands of 
my enemies, this miserable fate had not befallen me. Oh, 
I appeal to God the Great Judge, against the injustice 
which has been done me.' 

There was none there that could endure it. They 
turned away, with the tears running down their faces. In 



a moment I was on my knees at her feet. At once she 
thought only of my danger, and bent and whispered in my 
ear : ' Up ! — do not peril yourself, good heart. There — 
God bless you always ! ' and I felt the quick clasp of her 
hand. Mine was the last hand she touched with hers in 
life. None saw it ; history does not know of it or tell of it, 
yet it is true, just as I have told it. The next moment she 
saw Cauchon coming, and she went and stood before him 
and reproached him, saying — 

' Bishop, it is by you that I die ! ' 

He was not shamed, not touched, but said, smoothly — 

' Ah, be patient, Joan. You die because you have not 
kept your promise, but have returned to your sins.' 

' Alas,' she said, ' if you had put me in the Church's 
prison, and given me right and proper keepers, as you 
promised, this would not have happened. And for this I 
summon you to answer before God ! ' 

Then Cauchon winced, and looked less placidly content 
than before, and he turned him about and went away. 

Joan stood awhile musing. She grew calmer, but
