— all those faces became as wax, and I seemed sitting with 
a congress of the dead. 

At last, faint and far and weird and slow, came a 
' boom ! — boom ! — boom ! ' — a distant bell tolling midnight. 
When the last stroke died, that depressing stillness fol- 
lowed again, and as before I was staring at those waxen 
faces and feeling those airy touches on my hair and my 
shoulders once more. 

One minute — two minutes — three minutes of this, then 
we heard a long deep groan, and everybody sprang up and 
stood, with his legs quaking. It came from that little 
dungeon. There was a pause, then we heard muffled sob- 
bings, mixed with pitiful ejaculations. Then there was a 
second voice, low and not distinct, and the one seemed 
trying to comfort the other ; and so the two voices went 
on, with moanings, and soft sobbings, and, ah, the tones 
were so full of compassion and sorrow and despair ! 
Indeed, it made one's heart sore to hear it. 

But those sounds were so real and so human and so 
moving that the idea of ghosts passed straight out of our 
minds, and Sir Jean de Metz spoke out and said — 

' Come ! we will smash that wall and set those poor 
captives free. Here, with your axe ! ' 

The Dwarf jumped forward, swinging his great axe 
with both hands, and others sprang for the torches and 
brought them ! Bang ! — whang ! — slam ! — smash went 
the ancient bricks, and there was a hole an ox could pass 
through. We plunged within and held up the torches. 

Nothing there but vacancy ! On the floor lay a rusty 
sword and a rotten fan. 

Now you know all that I know. Take the pathetic 
relics, and weave about them the romance of the dung-eon's 
long-vanished inmates as best you can. 

CHAPTER XX 

The next day Joan wanted to go against the enemy again, 
but it was the feast of the Ascension, and the holy council 
of bandit generals were too pious to be willing to profane 
it with bloodshed. But privately they profaned it with 
plottings, a sort of industry just in their line. They 
decided to do the only thing proper to do now in the new 
circumstances of the case — feign an attack on the most 
important bastille on the Orleans side, and then, if the 
English weakened the far more important fortresses on the 
other side of the river to come to its help, cross in force 
and capture those works. This would give them the 
bridge and free communication with the Sologne, which 
was French territory. They decided to keep this latter 
part of the programme secret from Joan. 

Joan intruded and took them by surprise. She asked 
them what they were about and what they had resolved 
upon. They said they had resolved to attack the most 
important of the English bastilles on the Orleans side next 
morning- — and there the spokesman stopped. Joan said — 

' Well, goon.' 

' There is nothing more. That is all.' 

' Am I to believe this ? That is to say, am I to believe 
that you have lost your wits ? ' She turned to Dunois, 
and said, ' Bastard, you have sense, answer me this : if 
this attack is made and the bastille taken, how much 
better off would we be than we are now ? ' 

The Bastard hesitated, and then began some rambling 
talk not quite germane to the question. Joan interrupted 
him and said — 

' That will do, good Bastard, you have answered. 
Since the Bastard is not able to mention any advantage to 
be gained by taking that bastille and stopping there, it is 
not likely that any of you could better the matter. You 
waste much time here in inventing plans that lead to 
nothing, and making delays that are a damage. Are you 
concealing something from me ? Bastard, this council has 
a general plan, I take it ; without going into details, what 
is it ? ' 

' It is the same it was in the beginning, seven months 
ago — to get provisions in for a long siege, and then sit 
down and tire the English out.' 

' In the name of God ! As if seven months was not 
enough, you want to provide for a year of it. Now ye shall 
drop these pusillanimous dreams — the English shall go in 
three days ! ' 

Several exclaimed — 

' Ah, General, General, be prudent ! '
