man. "I wouldn't have them drowned for the 
world !" 

Her brother puffed his cigar a few moments in 
silence. "Your sympathy with kittens, Lavinia," 
he presently resumed, " arises from a feline element 
in your own character.'" 

" Cats are very graceful, and very clean," said Mrs. 
Penniman, smiling. 

"And very stealthy. You are the embodiment 
both of grace and of neatness ; but you are wanting 
in frankness." 

" You certainly are not, dear brother." 

" I don't pretend to be graceful, though I try to 
be neat. Why haven't you let me know that Mr. 
Morris Townsend is coming to the house four times 
a week ?" 

Mrs. Penniman lifted her eyebrows. " Four times 
a week !" 

" Three times, then, or five times, if you prefer it. 
I am away all day, and I see nothing. But when 
such things happen, you should let me know." 

Mrs. Penniman, with her eyebrows still raised, re- 
flected intently. "Dear Austin," she said at last, 
" I am incapable of betraying a confidence. I would 
rather suffer anything." 

" Never fear ; you shall not suffer. To whose con- 
fidence is it you allude ? Has Catherine made you 
take a vow of eternal secrecy ?" 





"By no means. Catherine has not told me as 
much as she might. She has not been very trust- 
ful." 

" It is the young man, then, who has made you his 
confidante ? Allow me to say that it is extremely in- 
discreet of you to form secret alliances with young 
men ; you don't know where they may lead you." 

"I don't know what you mean by an alliance," 
said Mrs. Penniman. "I take a great interest in 
Mr. Townsend ; I won't conceal that. But that's 
all." 

" Under the circumstances, that is quite enough. 
What is the source of your interest in Mr. Towns- 
end ?" 

"Why," said Mrs. Penniman, musing, and then 
breaking into her smile, " that he is so interesting !" 

The Doctor felt that he had need of his patience. 
" And what makes him interesting ? his good 
looks?" 

" His misfortunes, Austin." 

"Ah, he has had misfortunes? That, of course, 
is always interesting. Are you at liberty to men- 
tion a few of Mr. Townsend's ?" 

" I don't know that he would like it," said Mrs. 
Penniman. "He has told me a great deal about 
himself he has told me, in fact, his whole history. 
But I don't think I ought to repeat those things. 
He would tell them to you, I am sure, if he thought 
you would listen to him kindly. With kindness you 
may do anything with him." 

The Doctor gave a laugh. " I shall request him 
very kindly, then, to leave Catherine alone." 

" Ah !" said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her forefin- 





ger at her brother, with her little finger turned out, 
" Catherine has probably said something to him kind- 
er than that !" 

" Said that she loved him ? do you mean that ?" 

Mrs. Penniinan fixed her eyes on the floor. " As 
I tell you, Austin, she doesn't confide in me." 

"You have an opinion, I suppose, all the same.
