where two wide-branching oaks mingle their leaves, mak- 
ing a sombre shade over a moss-grown rock. Rustic seats 
have been arranged in this tempting nook. She takes one, 
and motions him to the other. 

"When I first saw you," she begins with averted eyes, 



 



 



 

" there was something mysteriously suggestive, and I hare 
been trying to solve it. I am certain I have reached the 
truthâ€” " How hard it is to utter it I " You are Wilfred 
Carew. This was for a while yours and your mother's 
home." 

The man's self-possession is simply magnificent. The 
long black lashes do not quiver on his cheek, there is no 
betraying flush, no mad desperation or impatience, but a 
cool, fascinating, incredulous smile. Yet he would give 
worlds to know what card among those he holds he had 
better play out. * He has never been wildly, desperately in 
love, but he feels that all the better worshipping part of 
his nature could flow tumultuously towards this woman. 
Shall he confess and try to win her? She has no lover to 
set up as a barrier against him. 

" You think so? " he says, in a weary but most melliflu- 
ous tone. 

She turns then, and his face baffles her scrutiny. For 
an instant the very ground seems slipping from under her 
feet, yet that positive inner sense deepens, crystallizes in 
her very face, and he, quick to read, to detect meanings, 
understands and takes his decision from it. 

There is a soft, sweet, winsome laugh, such as a child 
gives when one has made several pretences at guessing a 
secret and at last hits upon it.

charmed. 

" I was hardly likely to forget that part of my life," 
she says coldly. 

The die is cast and he must make the best of it, yet he

him thither. 

" Kismet,' he answers, in a soft, foreign-sounding pro- 
nunciation, lifting his delicately arched brows with the 
touch of audacity that appeals rather than offends. '' A 
chain of incidents opened the way, and I wanted to see 
you. Christmas, I was your friend in that solitary, re- 
pressed, misunderstood girlhood. There are many things 
that you cannot have forgotten." 

There is something inexpressibly sincere in his tone, 
and it does move her. 

" There are many things I never could forget." And she 
makes a gesture of bitter disdain. 

"Yet they were not my fault That a yiUain should 
have been the ruin of us all, I as a young lad could not 
help. My mother suffered intensely, bitterly, knew want 
and sorrow and regret. She often spoke of you. We 
never could hear aught concerning you, though we made 
some efforts. Then she died."
