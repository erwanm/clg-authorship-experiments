Every word was a stab in March's heart, so weakly 
tender to his own; his wife's tears, after so much 
experience of the comparative lightness of the griefs 
that weep themselves out in women, always seemed 
wrung from his own soul ; if his children suffered in 
the least through him, he felt like a murderer. It 
was far worse than he could have imagined, the way 
his wife took the affair, though he had imagined 
certain words, or perhaps only looks, from her that 
were bad enough. He had allowed for trouble, 
but trouble on his account : a sympathy that might 



  

burden and embarrass him ; but he had not dreamt 
of this merely domestic, this petty, this sordid view 
of their potential calamity, which left him wholly 
out of the question, and embraced only what was 
most crushing and desolating in the prospect. He 
could not bear it. He caught up his hat againgst and 
with some hope that his wife would try to keep him, 
rushed out of the house. He wandered aimlessly 
about, thinking the same exhausting thoughts over 
and over, till he found himself horribly hungry; 
then he went into a restaurant for his lunch, and 
when he paid, he tried to imagine how he should 
feel if that were really his last dollar. 

He went home toward the middle of the afternoon, 
b-Wsely hoping that Fulkerson had sent him some 
cunciliatory message, or perhaps was waiting there 
for him to talk it over ; March was quite willing to 
talk it over now. But it was his wife who again met 
him at the door, though it seemed another woman 
than the one he had left weeping in the morning. 

" I told the children," she said, in smiling ex- 
planation of his absence from lunch, " that perhaps 
you were detained by business. I didn't know but 
you had gone back to the office." 

" Did you think I would go back there, Isabel ? " 
asked March, with a haggard look. " Well, if you 
say so, I will go back, and do what Dryfoos ordered 
me to do. I 'm sufficiently cowed between him and 
you, I can assure you." 

" Nonsense," she said. " I approve of everything 
you did. But sit down, now, and don't keep walk- 



  

ing that way, and let me see if I understand it per- 
fectly. Of course I had to have my say out." 

She made him go all over his talk with Dryfoos 
again, and report his own language })reciscly. From 
time to time, as she got his points, she said, " That 
was splendid," " Good enough for him ! " And " Oh, 
I 'm so glad you said that to him ! " At the end she 
said, " Well, now, let 's look at it from his point of 
view. Let 's be perfectly just to him before we take 
another step forward." 

" Or backward," March suggested ruefully. " The 
case is simply this : he owns the magazine." 

" Of course." 

"And he has a right to expect that I will con- 
sider his pecuniary interests " 

" Oh, those detestable pecuniary interests ! Don't 
you wish there wasn't any money in the world ? " 

" Yes ; or else that there was a great deal more 
of it. â€” And I was perfectly willing to do that. I 
have always kept that in mind as one of my duties 
to him, ever since I understood what his relation to 
the magazine was." 

" Yes, I can bear witness to that in any court of 
justice. You've done it a great deal more than I 
could, Basil. And it was just the same way with 
tliose horrible insurance people." 

"I know," March went on, trying to be proof 
against her flatteries, or at least to look as if he did 
not deserve praise ; " I know that what Lindau said 
was offensive to him, and I can understand how he 
felt that he had a right to punish it. All I say is 
that he had no right to punish it through me."
