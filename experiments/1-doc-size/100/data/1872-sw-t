and was waiting for it. Matilda could think of nothing else; her talk
all came to an end.

"Norton hasn't much to say to-night," Mrs. Bartholomew remarked. "No
more than if he were my boy."

"I haven't anything to talk about," said Norton, looking at nothing but
his book.

"Matilda has lost her tongue too," said Judy.

"She never had such a one as yours," replied her grandmother; "you must
remember that. It isn't such a loss in the house."

Judy seemed inclined to pout at this; but then her attention was turned
to her brother, who began rather suddenly.

"May I speak, grandmamma?"

"I shall be very happy to hear," said Mrs. Lloyd smiling.

"I am not so sure of that," said David; "at least, not of you all;
though I really have something to say."

All eyes turned to David. Norton looked up at him from under his brows,
with a strange expression of curiosity and displeasure. Matilda only
looked away. David hesitated, then went on very calmly and gently.

"You know, mother and grandmother, that I have been very strong in my
love for my own people, and very strong in my sympathies with them."

"Is it in the past tense?" asked Mrs. Lloyd.

"And very fixed in my prejudices against what was not Jewish; against
what in your beliefs was contrary to mine."

"We all know that," said his mother a little bitterly.

"Is that in the past tense?" demanded Judy.

"I joined with my people in expecting the Messiah and hoping for him."

"Did you?" said his mother.

"I have changed," said David slowly. "I have been studying these things
for some time past; I have studied and studied; and now I know. Our
Messiah has come; our people did not know him, and--they lost him. I
know now that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah."

A scream of startled rage from Judy broke in upon the closing
utterances of this speech. She prevented everybody else.

"You do not mean to say that, David Bartholomew!" she exclaimed,
jumping out of her chair and standing before him. "You don't mean it."

"Do I ever say what I do not mean, Judy?" he answered gravely.

"Say it again. Say you have left us and gone over to the Christians."

"Judy! are you not ashamed!" cried Mrs. Bartholomew. "What do you think
of your mother?"

"Nothing," said Judy. "I'm not talking of you, mamma. You are neither
one thing nor the other. You are nothing. Have you gone over, David?"

"You know what I said," her brother answered. "I believe that Jesus of
Nazareth is the Messiah."

"The Christians' Messiah," said Judy scornfully.

"Theirs and ours," said David sorrowfully. "Messiah ben David, the King
of Israel."

"Take that!" said Judy, administering a slap on the cheek which was
heartily delivered. "You are a mean good-for-nothing, David
Bartholomew! and I wish your name was something else."

All the voices in the room cried out upon Judy except her brother's.
His colour changed, back and forth, but he was silent She stood in the
centre of the room like a little fury.

"Judy, Judy! Sit down!" said Mrs. Bartholomew. But it was doubtful if
Judy heard.

"What do you think your uncle Solomon and Rabbi Nathan will say to you,
you mean boy!" she cried. "I am going straight to tell them."

"I will tell them myself, Judy," said David.

"And what do you think they will say to you, hey? You deserve all
you'll get. Ugh! What is a Jew who isn't a Jew any longer?"

"I was going to tell you what I am," said David. "Grandmamma, I had not
finished what I had to say to you."

"Let him speak, Judy," said Mrs. Lloyd.

"If the rest is like the beginning, I don't want to hear it," said Judy.

"You need not hear it," said her mother. "Leave the room, then."
