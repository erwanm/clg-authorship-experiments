death? How long did it take a man to look round quickly? Much less than
a second, surely! Without effort or hurry a man could turn his head all
the way from left to right, so as to look over each shoulder
alternately, while a second pendulum swung once. A second was a much
longer time than most people realised. Instruments made for scientific
photography could be made to expose the plate not more than
one-thousandth of a second. Corbario knew that, and wondered whether a
man's eye could receive any impression in so short a time. He shuddered
when he thought that it might be possible.
The question was to be answered sooner than he expected. The doctors had
reported that a week must pass before Marcello would be strong enough to
undergo the operation, but he improved so quickly after he reached the
hospital that it seemed useless to wait. It was not considered to be a
very dangerous operation, nor one which weakened the patient much.
Regina was not allowed to be present, and when Marcello had been wheeled
out of his room, already under ether, she went and stood before the
window, pressing down her clasped hands upon the marble sill with all
her might, and resting her forehead against the green slats of the
blind. She did not move from this position while the nurse made
Marcello's bed ready to receive him on his return. It was long to wait.
The great clock in the square struck eleven some time after he had been
taken away, then the quarter, then half-past.
Regina felt the blood slowly sinking to her heart. She would have given
anything to move now, but she could not stir hand or foot; she was cold,
yet somehow she could not even shiver; that would have been a relief;
any motion, any shock, any violent pain would have been a thousand times
better than the marble stillness that was like a spell.
Far away on the Janiculum Folco Corbario sat in his splendid library
alone, with strained eyes, waiting for the call of the telephone that
stood on the polished table at his elbow. He, too, was motionless, and
longed for release as he had never thought he could long for anything. A
still unlighted cigar was almost bitten through by his sharp front
teeth; every faculty was tense; and yet it was as if his brain had
stopped thinking at the point where expectation had begun. He could not
think now, he could only suffer. If the operation were successful there
would be more suffering, doubt still more torturing, suspense more
agonising still.
The great clock over the stables struck eleven, then the quarter, then
half-past. The familiar chimes floated in through the open windows.
A wild hope came with the sound. Marcello, weak as he was, had died
under ether, and that was the end. Corbario trembled from head to foot.
The clock struck the third quarter, but no other sound broke the
stillness of the near noon-tide. Yes, Marcello must be dead.
Suddenly, in the silence, came the sharp buzz of the instrument. He
leapt in his seat as if something had struck him unawares, and then,
instantly controlling himself, he grasped the receiver and held it to
his ear.
"Signor Corbario?" came the question.
"Yes, himself."
"The hospital. The operation has been successful. Do you hear?"
"Yes. Go on."
"The patient has come to himself. He remembers everything."
"Everything!" Corbario's voice shook.
"He is Marcello Consalvi. He asks for his mother, and for you."
"How--in what way does he ask for me? Will my presence do him good--or
excite him?"
The moment had come, and Folco's nerve was restored with the sense of
danger. His face grew cold and expressionless as he waited for the
answer.
"He speaks most affectionately of you. But you had better not come until
this afternoon, and then you must not stay long. The doctors say he must
rest quietly."
"I will come at four o'clock. Thank you. Good-bye."
"Good-bye."
The click of the instrument, as Folco hung the receiver on the hook, and
it was over. He shut his eyes and leaned back in his chair, his arms
hanging by his sides as if there were no strength in them, and his head
falling forward till his chin rested on his chest. He remained so for a
long time without moving.
But in the room at the hospital Marcello lay in bed with his head bound
up, his cheek on the pillow, and his eyes fixed on Regina's face, as she
knelt beside him and fanned him slowly, for it was hot.
"Sleep, heart of my heart," she said softly. "Sleep and rest!"
There was a sort of peaceful wonder in his look now. Nothing vacant,
nothing that lacked meaning or understanding. But he did not answer her,
he only gazed into her face, and gazed and gazed till his eyelids
drooped and he fell asleep with a smile on his lips.
CHAPTER IX
Two years had passed since Marcello had been brought home from the
hospital, very feeble still, but himself again and master of his memory
and thoughts.
In his recollection, however, there was a blank. He had left Aurora
standing in the gap, where the storm swept inland from the sea; then the
light had gone out suddenly, in something violent which he could not
understand, and after that he could remember nothing except that he had
wandered in lonely places, trying to find out which way he was going,
and terrified by the certainty that he had lost all sense of direction;
so he had wandered on by day and night, as in a dark dream, and had at
last fallen asleep, to wake in the wretched garret of the inn on the
Frascati road, with Regina kneeling beside him and moistening his lips
from a glass of water.
He remembered that and other things, which came back to him uncertainly,
like the little incidents of his early childhood, like the first words
he could remember hearing and answering, like the sensation of being on
his mother's knee and resting his head upon her shoulder, like the smell
of the roses and the bitter-orange blossoms in the villa, like the first
sensation of being set upon a pony's back in San Domenico, while
Corbario held him up in the saddle, and tried to make his little hands
hold the bridle. The inn was quite as far away as all that, and but for
Regina he might have forgotten it altogether.
