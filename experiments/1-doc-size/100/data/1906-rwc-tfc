There was a silence ; he bent forward a trifle, gravely 
scrutinising a " hand-painted " name card, though it 
might not have astonished him to learn that somebody's 
foot had held the brush. Somewhere in the vicinity 
Grace Ferrall had discovered a woman who supported 
dozens of relatives by painting that sort of thing for 
the summer residents at Vermillion Point down the coast. 
So being charitable she left an order, and being thrifty, 
insisted on using the cards, spite of her husband's gibes. 

People were now inspecting them with more or less 
curiosity ; Siward found his " hand-painting " so unat- 
tractive that he had just tipped it over to avoid seeing 
it, when a burst of laughter from Lord Alderdene made 
everybody turn. Mrs. Vendenning was laughing ; so was 
Rena Bonnesdel looking over Quarrier's shoulder at a 
card he was holding — not one of the " hand "-decorated, 
but a sheet of note-paper containing a drawing of a 
man rushing after a gun-shy dog. 





 



The extraordinary cackling laughter of his lord- 
ship obliterated other sounds for a while ; Rena Bonnesdel possessed herself of the drawing and held it up amid 
a shout of laughter. And, to his excessive annoyance, 
Siward saw that, unconsciously, he had caricatured Quar- 
ter — Ferrall's malicious request for a Vandyke beard 
making the caricature dreadfully apparent. 

Quarrier had at first flushed up; then he forced a 
smile; but his symmetrical features were never cordial 
when he smiled. 

" Who on earth did that? " whispered Sylvia Landis 
apprehensively. " Mr. Quarrier dislikes that sort of 
thing — but of course he'll take it well." 

" Did he ever chase his own dog.'' " asked Siward, 
biting his lip. 

" Yes — so Blinky says — in the Carolinas last season. 
It's Blinky ! — that's his notion of humour. Did you 
ever hear such a laugh.? No wonder Mr. Quarrier is 
annoyed." 

The gay uproar had partly subsided, renewed here 
and there as the sketch was passed along, and finally, 
making the circle, returned like a bad penny to Quarrier. 
He smiled again, symmetrically, as he received it, nodding his compliments to Alderdene. 

" Oh, no," cackled his lordship ; " I didn't draw it, 
old chap ! " 

" Nor I ! I only wish I could," added Captain 
Voucher. 

" Nor I — nor I — who did it.? " ran the chorus along
the table. 

"  didn't do it ! " said Sylvia gravely, looking across 
at Quarrier. And suddenly Quarrier's large, handsome 
eyes met Siward's for the briefest fraction of a second, 
then were averted. But into his face there crept an 









expressionless pallor that did not escape Siward — no, 
nor Sylvia Landis. 

Presently under cover of a rapid fire of chatter she 
said: " Did you draw that? " 

" Yes ; I had no idea it was meant for him. You 
may imagine how likely I'd be to take any liberty with 
a man who already dislikes me." 

" But it resembles him — in a very dreadful way." 

" I know it. You must take my word for what I 
have told you." 

She looked up at him : " I do." Then : " It's a pity ; 
Mr. Quarrier does not consider such things humourous. 
He — he is very sensitive. . . . Oh, I wish that fool Englishman had been in Ballyhoo ! " 

" But he didn't do it ! " 

" No, but he put you up to it — or Grace Ferrall did.
