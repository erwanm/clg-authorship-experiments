“Get some water,” said Wentworth—”bathe his face.”

This seemed good advice, and Gerald followed it. In a short time his
father opened his eyes and looked about him in a dazed fashion.

“How do you feel, father? What made you faint?” asked Gerald.

“I dreamed that Bradley Wentworth was here, and that we had a
discussion. He—he would not agree to my terms.”

“He is here,” said Gerald, and Wentworth came forward.

“Then—it is all real.”

“Yes,” said Wentworth, “but you are in no condition to talk. Let us
defer our conversation.”

“Alas! I do not know how much time I have left——”

“You can rely upon me to be a friend to your son, Lane.”

“And yet——”

“Don’t let us go into details. You are not strong enough to talk at
present. I am sure Gerald will agree with me.”

“Yes, father,” said Gerald. “Mr. Wentworth is right. Wait till this
afternoon. I want to come in and cook the trout. It is high time for
dinner.”

“You say well, Gerald,” put in Wentworth. “I don’t mind confessing that
I am almost famished. If there were a hotel near I wouldn’t encroach
upon your hospitality. As it is, I admit that a dinner of trout would
be most appetizing. And now, if you don’t mind, I will go outside and
smoke a cigar while your son is preparing it.”

“That will be best, Mr. Wentworth,” said Gerald approvingly. “If you
remain here father will be talking, and he has already exhausted his
strength.”

“I will take a little walk,” said Wentworth, as he stepped out of the
cabin, “but I won’t be away more than half an hour.”

“Very well, sir.”

When Wentworth was at a safe distance Gerald advanced to his father’s
chair, and said in a low voice: “Father, I distrust that man. When I
came into the room he was searching the bureau drawer.”

Warren Lane nodded.

“He was after the papers,” he said. “He offered me a thousand dollars
for them.”

“And you declined?”

“Yes: I will not barter my son’s inheritance for a mess of pottage.”

“I would rather have you do that, father, than have your last moments
disturbed.”

“I will not permit myself to be disturbed. But, Gerald, I have one
warning to give you. When I am gone this man will leave no stone
unturned to get possession of those papers. Don’t let him have them!”

“I won’t, father. You had better not let him know that I have them.”

“I shall not, but he will guess it. You will need all your shrewdness
to defeat him.”

“I will bear that in mind, father. Now dismiss the matter from your
thoughts. I know your wishes, and I understand the character of the man
who is your enemy and mine.”

Warren Lane breathed a sigh of relief.

“That lifts a burden from my mind,” he said. “I am glad I took you
into my confidence this morning. It was high time. I have done all I
could, and must leave the rest to Providence and your own judgment and
discretion.”

“That’s right, father. You have taught me to rely upon myself. I am
ready and willing to paddle my own canoe.”

“I hope you won’t make such a failure of life as I have, Gerald.”

“Don’t say that, father. Rather let me hope that when I die I shall
leave behind me one who will love me as much as I love you.”

Warren Lane regarded his son with affection.

“You have my blessing, Gerald. May God bless you as you have blessed
me.”

An hour later Bradley Wentworth re-entered the cabin. A table was
spread, and the appetizing odors of the trout were grateful to the
nostrils of the hungry man. With boiled potatoes, cornbread and coffee,
the meal was by no means to be despised. Seldom in his own luxurious
house had Bradley Wentworth so enjoyed a dinner.
