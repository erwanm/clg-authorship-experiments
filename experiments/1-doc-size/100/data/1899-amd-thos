evening and older people looked on and wondered if they 
had ever had such a good time in their youth. 

Sherburne Beaumanoir was a trifle annoyed by Miss 
Maurice's answer to his note. It was not curt, rather too 
business-like and evasive. After that he dared not take 
in the little town, for he was a gentleman. 

He was lounging on the sands one afternoon beside 
Princess, to whom he had just brought a handful of 
letters. 

"This is from Ruth," she said. "And O, this is 
from Kitty Saxon." 

"And is there one from the other girl â€” that came to 
your luncheon in New York?" asked the deceitful young 
man, in his most indifferent tone. 

" Miss Maurice? No. She is a queer correspondent. 
She did write me one letter a day or two after she went 
home. O, I believe I have not answered it." 

" You naughty girl ! What is her home like ? " 

"They live in an old, old house that belonged to her 
mother's father " 

" Then she had a grandfather ? " 

" O yes. They are old Delaware people. You know 
there are a great many nice, comparatively poor people 
scattered about the world," 





" Yes, my dear young mentor. But her folks were 
able to send her to school with the aristocracy, it seems." 

" The way it came was this. I suppose I may tell over 
the story, since she did not make any secret of it. I think 
she is very honest. And it was delightful that she should 
meet Mrs. Townsend." 

Sherburne was much interested in the school episode 
and the marriage of her sister. 

" I suppose the home isn't " 

" Things go at very loose ends, I fancy." 

Princess colored a little, thinking of Uncle Con. That 
was his secret, and she had no right to even suggest there 
was a secret. 

Sherburne comforted himself with the thought that 
Miss Maurice had a good deal of pride and her home 
was not quite what she would like to invite curious eyes 
to inspect. But she need not have minded him. 

" O, look at this," exclaimed Princess, a few days 
later, holding a paper in her hand. "Mrs. Townsend 
has gone to Chautauqua. She is to speak in two of the 
courses. And I suppose Miss Maurice went with her." 

Sherburne was devoted in an amusing fashion to Pearl 
Amory, who was proud of her good-looking cousin. 

Princess found Ned Beaumanoir very entertaining. 
He could talk to one girl very well, and he knew so 
many curious things, even if he did not shine in general 
society. But Sherburne soon became a prime favorite, 
and was in great demand among the girls outside of 
cousinly lines. Bertram was hardly old enough to enjoy 
the badinage, but he did like the sails and the rowing, 
and the walks along the beach. He often coaxed Prin- 
cess to accompany him. And he let her read the pro- 
fessor's letters, which were full of entertainment. 





" He seems just like another boy with you," said Prin- 
cess, with a soft smile in her eyes. 

" He is. A splendid, wise big boy that you can never 
bother with questions. If he can't talk about the subject 
just then, he gets you a book to read about it. I don't 
see how he can remember so many things. And if I 
wasn't myself and going up to Columbia College, and 
had to be a girl, I'd just like to be Ruth Ensign." 

Princess felt a sudden heat in her cheeks. 

" Wasn't it queer that we should think him old up 
there on Melchias island?" Then Bertram laughed. 
"But I am glad I don't have to be a girl, though you
