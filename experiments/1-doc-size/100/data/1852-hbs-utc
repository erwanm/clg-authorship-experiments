looked in vain among the gang, as they poured along, for 
companionable faces. He saw only sullen, scowling, embruted men, and feeble, discouraged women, or women that 
were not women the strong pushing away the weak the 
gross, unrestricted animal selfishness of human beings, of 
whom nothing good was expected and desired ; and who, 
treated in every way like brutes, had sunk as nearly to 
their level as it was possible for human beings to do. To a 
late hour in the night the sound of the grinding was protracted ; for the mills were few in number compared with the 
grinders, and the weary and feeble ones were driven back 
by the strong, and came on last in their turn. 

" Ho yo ! " said Sambo, coming to the mulatto woman, 
and throwing down a bag of corn before her, " what a cuss 
yo name ? " 

" Lucy," said the woman. 

" Wai, Lucy, yo my woman now. To grind dis yer corn, 
and get my supper baked, ye har P " 

" I an't your woman, and I won't be ! " said the woman, 
with the sharp sudden courage of despair ; " you go 'long !" 

" I'll kick yo, then ! " said Sambo, raising his foot 
threateningly. 

" Te may kill me, if ye choose the sooner the better 
"Wish't I was dead ! " said she. 

" I say, Sambo, you go to spilin' the hands, I'll tell mas'r 
o' you," said Quimbo, who was busy at the mill, from which 
he had viciously driven two or three tired women, who were 
waiting to grind their corn. 

" And I'll tell him ye won't let the women come to the 
mills, yo old nigger ! " said Sambo. " Yo jes keep to yo own 
row." 

Tom was hungry with his day's journey, and almost faint 
for want of food. 

" Thar, yo ! " said Quimbo, throwing down a coarse bag, 
which contained a peck of corn ; " thar, nigger, grab take 
car on't, yo won't get no more dis yer week." 

Tom waited till a late hour to get a place at the mills ; 
and then, moved by the utter weariness of two women, 
whom he saw trying to grind their corn there, he ground 
for them, put together the decaying brands of the fire, 
where many had baked cakes before them, and then went 




about getting his own supper. It was a new kind of work 
there a deed of charity, small as it was ; but it woke an 
answering touch in their hearts an expression of womanly 
kindness came over their hard faces. They mixed his cake 
for him, and tended its baking ; and Tom sat down by the 
light of the fire, and drew out his Bible for he had need of 
comfort. 

" What's that ? " said one of the women. 

"A Bible," said Tom. 

" Good Lord ! han't seen un since I was in Kentuck." 

" Was you raised in Kentuck ? " said Tom, with 
interest. 

" Yes, and well raised, too ; never 'spected to come to dis 
yer! " said the woman, sighing. 

" What's dat ar book, any way ? " said the other woman. 

"Why, the Bible." 

" Laws a me, what's dat ? " said the woman. 

" Do tell ! you never heam on't ? " said the other woman. 
" I used to har missis a readin' on't, sometimes, in Kentuck; 
but, laws o' me ! we don't har nothin' here but crackin' and 
swarin'." 

" Read apiece, anyways!" said the first woman, curiously, 
seeing Tom attentively poring over it. 

Tom read, " Come unto ME, all ye that labour and are 
heavy laden, and I will give you rest." 

"Them's good words enough," said the woman; "who 
says 'em?" 

The Lord," said Tom. 

"I jest wish I know'd whar to find Him," said the 
woman ; " I would go. 'Pears like I never should get 
rested agin. My flesh is fairly sore, and I tremble all over, 
every day, and Sambo's allers a jawin' at me, 'cause I doesn't
