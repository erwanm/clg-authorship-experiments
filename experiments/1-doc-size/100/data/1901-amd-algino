“It is quite impossible,” began Barbe, almost 
brusquely. “You are a Catholic and Mademoiselle is 
a Protestant.” 

“But a wife would follow her husband in this matter, 
Madame,” he returned, with the most exquisitely polite 
certainty. 

“She — she does not love you. Monsieur. She is too 
young and inexperienced.” 

“She has reached that most adorable age when the girl 
is blossoming into the woman. And, Madame, no 
well-bred, refined young girl would love, before a man had 
spoken. Is it not so with your countrywomen? I beg 
for the delightful privilege of teaching her this sweet 
lesson. I ask your approval and consent. I shall not 
hurry the Senorita, but I know I can persuade her to 
regard me with favor. The rest will come.” 

Barbe shook her head decisively, and stood up her very 
tallest. 

“It is useless. Monsieur. And we must wait until we 
hear from the young Marquis. I would have no 
right ” 

“You have all the rights, Madame. The Marquis may 
be dead. And if he returns and finds his cousin happy 
in being betrothed to the man of her choice, who occupies 
a good position, could he have the heart to make her un- 
happy ?” 

“She does not wish to accept you. Monsieur.” 

Torres raised his eyebrows in surprise. His look 
almost extinguished poor Barbe, whose courage was 
rapidly giving way. 

“I must hear that from the Senorita herself,” he began. 




“Will you allow me to see her — in your presence of 
course,” bowing deferentially. 

“I will call her.” And Barbe withdrew with a formal 
courtesy, quite dismayed by the lover’s pertinacity. 

“You will have to come, Angel,” and she was almost 
on the point of tears. “I can see now why it is the 
proper thing to apply to the father. He is, in a sense, 
the owner of his daughter. But when a poor girl has 
neither father nor mother — and the lover is so resolved ! 
You see, he doesn’t expect you to love him now — well, 
that is right enough, too.” 

“Come,” said Angelique, with sudden bravery. 

“Sehor” — as she entered the court with a proud 
courtesy, — “Madame Champe is right in what she has 
said. I do not desire a lover. I have no wish to be 
married.” 

“But if you are the sole object of a man’s heart? 
Sehorita, I swear that I love you from the crown of your 
beautiful head to your dainty feet ; that it will be the one 
endeavor of my life to surround you with every delight 
and luxury — to adore you — to make your days visions of 
radiance! You will be happier than any woman ever 
was.” 

“I am sorry you should be so in earnest. I cannot 
divide my interest from our unfortunate little home 
circle. I have no wish at present to be loved. I do not 
want to marry. Senor, be kind enough to respect my 
wishes.” 

“The Senorita will never find me ungentlemanly. Yet 
my regret is deep and sincere. I should have devoted 
my whole life to making you happy. Even now, I must 
love you ” 

“Try to forget me in some other charming girl. There 




are so many of them,” and she endeavored to smile, but 
it was a faint semblance. 

*T shall be blind to their charms after having met the 
Sehorita. It was the best Christmas gift I had to prof- 
fer ” 

He looked so handsome and melancholy that Angehs 
heart was moved to pity, and yet she knew she must 
not express it, or her painful work would be all undone.
