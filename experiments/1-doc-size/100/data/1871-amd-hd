under her eyes, and a wan, feverish look in them. 

" Why, this is a surprise," she said, kissing Kathie 
with affection. " But I don't see how you came to 
stray in town when everybody else is straying out. 
You are not tired of green fields, surely ? ' 

Kathie explained. 

" Now," exclaimed the Doctor, looking at his watch, 
" I am going to leave you two girls for an hour or so, 
when I shall come back after Kathie, as I left Mrs. 
Jessie broken-hearted. So talk fast." 

Kathie was really shocked with the change in Ada, 



WHICH, - - HERSELF, OK HER NEIGHBOR V 

and the kind of wistful expression went to her heart 
at once. She did indeed look very delicate. Her 
fingers were slender enough for the most rigid re- 
quirements of fashion, and white enough, too, for that 
matter. 

The room was quite tidy and pleasant. Instead 
of the careless girl they had a very efficient woman, 
who rather admired Miss Ada, but considered her 
"not long for this world." 

" How glad I am to see you ! " Ada said, with much 
interest. " And so Bruce Mackenzie has gone off to 
have a visit with his new mother. How odd it seems 
that the General's wife should be your Aunt Ruth ! 
And you know you met him that night when you 
were at the opera with me. It is like a story-book, 
isn't it ? " 

" A good deal better," returned Kathie. " It is all 
real, and they are very happy." 

Ada sighed. " Everything has changed terribly 
since then. I only went to two operas last winter." 

" And I didn't go to any," said Kathie, cheerily. 

" But you were in Washington. Where will your 
uncle take you this summer ? ' : 

" Perhaps we shall not go anywhere." 
 



 

" Tell me about the Brookside girls and boys. It 
is so seldom that any one comes in to talk to me." 

Kathie described their graduating class and its 
success and Sue Coleman's little party. " They have 
planned a trip to the White Mountains,' she added. 

" I don't envy them. It seems such an undertak- 
ing to go climbing about ; though if one were well it 
would make a difference. I don't even want to go to 
the seaside." 

" Why ? " 

" I believe I begin to hate strange faces and all 
that. I would like to hide away where it was beau- 
tiful and quiet, and no one stared at me when I went 
to the table, and there was some one to talk with. I 
never feel well any more, you know, and I cannot 
stand the slightest exertion." 

" But if you could make a little " Kathie said, 
hesitatingly. 

" I can't. The least thing tires me to death. The 
only pleasure I should enjoy would be carriage rid- 
ing. I suppose you have your ponies yet ? ' 

" yes, and ever so much enjoyment with them." 

" You are a fortunate girl, Kathie Alston. I wish 
I had such health and spirits, yes, all, for it seems 




to me you cannot have a bit of pleasure if you are 
poor." 

" But a great many do," was the rather timid re- 
sponse. " And we were quite happy while we were 
poor."
