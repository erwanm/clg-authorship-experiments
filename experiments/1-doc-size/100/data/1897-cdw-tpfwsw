flected in the pages of Jonson, Shake- 
speare, and other writers. 

The town was full of coffee-houses 
and pleasure -gardens, but, curiously 
enough, the favorite place of public 
parading was the middle aisle of St. 
Paul's Cathedral— " Paul's Walk," as it 
was called — which was daily frequented 
by nobles, gentry, perfumed gallants, 




 

and ladies, from ten to twelve and three 
to six o'clock, to talk on business, pol- 
itics, or pleasure. Hither came, to ac- 
quire the fashions, make assignations, 
arrange for the night's gaming, or shun 
the bailiff, the gallant, the gamester, the 
ladies whose dresses were better than 
their manners, the stale knight, the 
captain out of service. Here Falstaff 
purchased Bardolph. " I bought him," 
says the knight, " at Paul's." The tai- 
lors went there to get the fashions of 
dress, as the gallants did to display 
them, one suit before dinner and an- 
other after. What a study was this 
varied, mixed, flaunting life, this dance 
of pleasure and license before the very 
altar of the church, for the writers of 
satire, comedy, and tragedy ! 

But it is not alone town life and court 
life and the society of the fine folk that 
is reflected in the English drama and 




 

literature of the seventeenth century, 
and here is another wide difference be- 
tween it and the French literature of 
the same period ; rural England and the 
popular life of the country had quite as 
much to do in giving tone and color to 
the writings of the time. It is necessary 
to know rural England to enter into the 
spirit of this literature, and to appreciate 
how thoroughly it took hold of life in 
every phase. Shakespeare knew it well. 
He drew from life the country gentle- 
man, the squire, the parson, the pedantic 
school-master who was regarded as half 
conjurer, the yeoman or farmer, the 
dairy maids, the sweet English girls, the 
country louts, shepherds, boors, and 
fools. How he loved a fool ! He had 
talked with all these persons, and knew 
their speech and humors. He had tak- 
en part in the country festivals — May 
Day, Plough Monday, the Sheep Shear- 




 

ing, the Morris Dances and Maud Ma- 
rian/ the Harvest Home and Twelfth 
Night. The rustic merry-makings, the 
feasts in great halls, the games on the 
greensward, the love of wonders and of 
marvellous tales, the regard for portents, 
the naive superstitions of the time pass 
before us in his pages. Drake, in his 
" Shakespeare and his Times," gives a 
graphic and indeed charming picture of 
the rural life of this century, drawn 
from Harrison and other sources. 

In his spacious hall, floored with 
stones and lighted by large transom 
windows, hung with coats of mail and 
helmets, and all military accoutrements, 
long a prey to rust, the country squire, 
seated at a raised table at one end, held 
a baronial state and dispensed prodigal 
hospitality. The long table was divided 
into upper and lower messes by a huge 
salt-cellar, and the consequence of the
