despair. The night dropped down, and still he peered out 
in the darkness with hot eyes and throbbing brow. Of 
what avail had been all the struggle, all the resolving? He 
might as well have stayed in Chicago. There he would not 
have seen Fay. She would be at Brookside, in the city. 
She knew all the friends in the little circle and would meet 
them. He should see her another's man's wife. That 
woke all the passion of jealousy within him. 

The tumult went on, fierce, eager, sullen, and despairing 
by turns. They ran into the station. How strange it 
looked in the yellow-red glare, and the voices seemed like 
something heard in another world ! Yonder was a train 
steaming up. If he were to take it, to-morrow morning he 
would be far away. Would it not be better ? Away from 
temptation ! He laughed bitterly. 

Should he go home to the Merediths' ? They would be 
sitting up for him, Fred and Mr. Meredith. To go in 
there, serene and pleasant, and answer questions, ah, it 
would madden him ! Better roam the streets all night. 

Something came to him suddenly, and he stood quite 
still, as if stopped in the way. 





"When you come to love a woman placed out of your 
reach you will go to God, for nothing else will be strong 
enough to save you ! " 

Bruce had said that to him. He, too, had seen a love 
placed out of his way. 

At first Robert Alston had a dim, awful impression that 
he did not want to be saved, that he was in some uncom- 
prehended way quite strong enough for himself, or that no 
salvation could comfort him for the tremendous sacrifice 
wrenched up out of his life. Not made freely, not given. 

Where should he go ? The night was growing chilly and 
the streets beginning to look deserted. 

He had tramped around unthinkingly until he found him- 
self in Charlie DarrelFs vicinity. Another who had sacri- 
ficed all. What a mocking, illusive thing love was, a 
sweet madness ! 

He glanced up. There was a light in the window. 
Was this hero calm and tranquil after his fight? Ah, he 
fancied lie had fought it all out, but he did not think then 
this might come. Had not some one said in a sermon 
that it was a life warfare ? Was Charlie Darrell fighting 
always? What if lie knew Kathie was about to marry 
another, could he still wear his high, heavenly smile ? Or 
was there a strength he, Rob, knew nothing about? Life 
had been so pleasant since that terrible time, and he had 
gone bravely onward, believing the great storms over-past. 
Why should this have come? 

He paced up and down the street. Curious bits floated 
through his mind in a sharp, electric fashion ; texts heard 
long ago, it seemed, almost in another life : " God is faith- 
ful, who will with the temptation also make a way to 
escape, that ye may be able to bear it." How many had 
escaped ? how many wanted to escape ? 

The window above him was raised and a figure leaned 
out a little. Rob dropped his head and drew up his 
shoulders. He could not make up his mind whether he 





desired to see Charlie or not, but the light from the oppo- 
site lamp betrayed him. 

" Rob, wait until I come down," said an entreating 
voice. 

The young man strode fiercely away, then paused. The 
door opened and a light step came flying after him. 

" Rob, are they all well at home ? What has happened ? " 

" Nothing," pulling half away . 

"Come back with me; I am all alone. Let us talk it 
over, for something has happened to you ? " 

" You cannot help me." 

Charlie was leading him back. The hall lamp was out, 
but they groped up-stairs, guided by the long ray of light 
from the open door. Entering, Charlie pushed a chair 
forward with a cordial invitation, but Rob stood stupidly. 
His hair was blown about, his face set and pale, and his
