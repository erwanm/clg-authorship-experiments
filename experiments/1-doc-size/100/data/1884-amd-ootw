hand. She was seventeen now, not as tall as her mother, 
in fact she looked smaller by the contrast. The prond 
poise of the head here seemed to carry with it the exalted 
Greek unconsciousness rather than the fine, fearless dignity 
of her mother; but she had the steadfast persistence, the 
innate purity. The fine dividing line was the greater 
intellectual force, the spiritual loveliness, the fervor of an 
inward sight richly endowed. In society's world the 
mother would still "shine the daughter down," but 
Thierry understood the subtile charm she possessed. 
Yet, given them all as free agents, on an equality, and he 
would have loved the mother first. 

"Yes, home again, and delighted to be here, though 
work has piled up mountains high in my absence. It 
would be a positive insult to ask if you are well. Mrs. 
Marshall, how comes it that you never seem worked out 
or fagged out? You always bring to mind an old poem 
that was in one of my early reading-books, which had no 
real merit that I remember, — only an exceeding freshness 
in the first line, — 

• The rose had been washed, lately washed in a shower,' 

and when I read it, I could always smell the freshness of 
the rose." 

" I have been enjoying a rather lazy time these two 
dull months," and she smiled. " It will doubtless surprise 
you that I have found time to pick up some of my old 
music, and actually paint a handful of flowers, to Celia's 
great amusement." 

"And what has Celia been doing? " 

" I am so glad you have come," she began eagerly, "I 
have painted a picture — you told me I might exercise 
myself in composition, and now that I have done it, I am 
afraid the subject is too hackneyed." 

" But the treatment is not," interposed Mrs. Marshall. 



 

" Fair penitent, I wonder if I shall be able to shrive you," 
and he laughed. " Is it roses, or lilacs, or a ruined mill ? " 

" Neither." There was such a demure prettiness in her 
eyes that for an instant she seemed almost coquettish. 

" It must be quite original if I have not guessed it in 
three guesses. Tou have roused my curiosity. Is it 
presentable?" 

" Let us go up stairs, mamma," Celia proposed ; and 
they wended their way thither. 

" I have been pleasing myself," commenced Celia. " It 
has been a kind of rest from the harder duties and realis- 
tic views. I have not decided whether to offer it for 
criticism, any more than one would bring out a dream to 
be shorn of all its fanciful concomitants." 

A panel of medium size stood on the easel. Thierry 
placed the lamp on a little side table where the light 
would fall properly upon it. A winding bit of stream 
leading to a background of meadow-land in a roseate haze 
that appeared at the first glance as sunrise, but on second 
view you discerned a shape, a faint yet perfect figure of a 
young girl, whose golden tresses fell far below her waist 
and were filleted with some dainty woodland blooms 
gathered from their mossy beds. One arm held clustering 
grasses and growths of earliest spring ; with the other she 
was scattering trailing arbutus. The glimpse of meadow 
lay in the suggestive tints that indicated rather than 
declared the advent of the season. At her feet the rill 
sparkled over a few pebbly stones; but at every half inch 
of space it grew colder, and out in the foreground beside 
the leafless shrubbery in brown and gray stems, the stones 
with their dried moss, there were fragments of thin, shelly 
ice. In a wavering diagonal across the corner on the 
brownish turf she had written, in fine antique lettering, 
the legend, — 

"The spring comes slowly up this way. " 

Thierry studied it in amaze. The delicate coloring, the 




soft, suggestive, tender, yet positive life she had managed 
to throw into it, the perfect perspective, the distance from 
the gleam of ice to the coining greenness of the meadow, 
with its slow, lovely gradations, was wonderful. You 
waited for spring to come, in a kind of hushed, breathless 
way ; you could feel the tender promise, the richness of 
the scattered arbutus blooms.
