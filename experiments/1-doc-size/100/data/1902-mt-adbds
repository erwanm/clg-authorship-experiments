Fairfax stop a mob! Well, I should 
smile ! Ex-desperado — nineteen scalps 
on his string. Can he I Oh, I say " 
As we tore up the gulch, distant 
cries and shouts and yells rose faintly 
on the still air, and grew steadily in 
strength as we raced along. Roar 
after roar burst out, stronger and 
stronger, nearer and nearer; and at 
last, when we closed up upon the mul- 
titude massed in the open area in 
front of the tavern, the crash of sound 
was deafening. Some brutal roughs 
from Daly's Gorge had Holmes in 
their grip, and he was the calmest 
man there; a contemptuous smile 
played about his lips, and if any fear 
of death was in his British heart, his 
iron personality was master of it, and 
no sign of it was allowed to appear. 
" Come to a vote, men!" This from 
one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly 
Higgins. "Quick I is it hang, or 
shoot?" 
"Neither I'' shouted one of his com- 
rades. "He'd be aHve again in a 
 week; burning's the only permanency 
for him." 
The gangs from all the outlying 
camps burst out in a thunder-crash of 
approval, and went struggling and 
surging toward the prisoner, and 
closed around him, shouting, "Firel 
fire's the ticket !" They dragged him 
to the horse-post, backed him against 
it, chained him to it, and piled wood 
and pine cones around him waist-deep. 
Still the strong face did not blench, 
and still the scornful smile played 
about the thin lips. 
"A match I fetch a match!" 
Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with 
his hand, stooped, and held it under 
a pine cone. A deep silence fell upon FunerMi 
the mob. The cone caught, a tiny p 
flame flickered about it a moment or 
two. I seemed to catch the soimd 
of distant hoofs — it grew more dis- 
tinct — still more and more distinct, 
more and more definite, but the ab- 
sorbed crowd did not appear to no- 
tice it. The match went out. The 
man struck another, stooped, and 
again the flame rose; this time it 
took hold and began to spread— here 
and there men turned away their 
faces. The executioner stood with 
the charred match in his fingers, 
watching his work. The hoof-beats 
turned a projecting crag, and now 
they came thundering down upon 
us. Almost the next moment there 
was a shout — 
"The sheriff !" 
And straightway he came tearing 
into the midst, stood his horse ahnost 
on his hind feet, and said, 
"Fall back, you gutter-snipes !'' 
He was obeyed. By all but their 
leader. He stood his ground, and his 
hand went to his revolver. The sher- 
iff covered him promptly, and said : 
"Drop your hand, you parlor-des- 
perado. Kick the fire away. Now 
unchain the stranger.'' 
The parlor-desperado obeyed. Then 
the sheriff made a speech; sitting 
his horse at martial ease, and not 
warming his words with any touch 
of fire, but delivering them in a meas- 
ured and deliberate way, and in a 
tone which harmonized with their 
character and made them impressive- 
ly disrespectful. 
" You're a nice lot — now ain't you? 
Just about eligible to travel with this 
bilk here — Shadbelly Higgins — this 
loud-mouthed sneak that shoots peo- 
ple in the back and calls himself a des- 
perado. If there's anything I do par- 
ticularly despise, it's a lynching mob; the mob 
I've never seen one that had a man 
in it. It has to tally up a hundred 
against one before it can pump up 
pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. 
It's made up of cowards, and so is 
the community that breeds it; and 
ninety-nine times out of a hundred 
the sheriff's another one' He paused 
— apparently to turn that last idea
