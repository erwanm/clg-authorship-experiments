my poor boy. You had better go home." 

" Well," said Clifford, " good night ! " 

" Have n't you a word to throw to a man when 
he has safely returned from a dangerous journey ? " 
Acton asked. 

" How do you do ? " said Clifford. " I thought 
I thought you were " and he paused, looking 
at the Baroness again. 



 

" You thought I was at Newport, eh ? So I was 

this morning." 

" Good night, clever child ! " said Madame Miin- 
ster, over her shoulder. 

Clifford stared at her not at all like a clever 
child ; and then, with one of his little facetious 
growls, took his departure. 

" What is the matter with him ? " asked Acton, 
when he was gone. " He seemed rather in a mud- 
dle." 

Eugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, 
listening a moment. " The matter the matter " 

she answered. " But you don't say such, things 
here." 

" If you mean that he had been drinking a lit- 
tle, you can say that." 

" He does n't drink any more. I have cured 
him. And in return he 's in love with me." 

It was Acton's turn to stare. He instantly 
thought of his sister ; but he said nothing about 
her. He began to laugh. " I don't wonder at his 
passion ! But I wonder at his forsaking your so- 
ciety for that of your brother's paint-brushes." 

Eugenia was silent a little. " He had not been 
in the studio. I invented that at the moment." 

" Invented it ? For what purpose ? " 

" He has an idea of being romantic. He has 
adopted the habit of coming to see me at midnight 



   

passing only through the orchard and through 
Felix's painting-room, which has a door opening 
that way. It seems to amuse him," added Eu- 
genia, with a little laugh. 

Acton felt more surprise than he confessed to, 
for this was a new view of Clifford, whose irregu- 
larities had hitherto been quite without the ro- 
mantic element. He tried to laugh again, but he 
felt rather too serious, and after a moment's hes- 
itation his seriousness explained itself. " I hope 
you don't encourage him," he said. " He must 
not be inconstant to poor Lizzie." 

" To your sister ? " 

"You know they are decidedly intimate," said 
Acton. 

"Ah," cried Eugenia, smiling, "has she has 
she " 

" I don't know," Acton interrupted, " what she 
has. But I always supposed that Clifford had a 
desire to make himself agreeable to her." 

" Ah, par exemple ! " the Baroness went on. 
" The little monster ! The next time he becomes 
sentimental I will him tell that he ought to be 
ashamed of himself." 

Acton was silent a moment. " You had better 
say nothing about it." 

" I had told him as much already, on general 
grounds," said the Baroness. " But in this coun-
