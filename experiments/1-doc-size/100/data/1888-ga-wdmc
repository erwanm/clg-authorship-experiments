a fame not altogether political. And now there 
was nothing left, and he felt that fate had used 
him scurrilously. He was twenty-eight, and had 
exhausted life. He had nothing left but to 




  

" The one in the next carriage, with Lady 
Langdon, talking to Bolton." 

The carriage passed them, and Harold's eyes 
met for a moment those of a girl who was lying 
back chatting idly with a man who rode on 
horseback beside her. She was a beautiful 
creature, truly, with a rich, dark skin, and eyes like a 
tropical animal's. A youthful face, striking and 
unconventional. 

"Well?" queried Hollington. 

"Yes, a very handsome girl," said Dartmouth. 
" I have seen her before, somewhere." 

"What! you have seen that woman before and 
not remembered her? Impossible! And then 
you have not been in England for a year." 

"I am sure I have seen her before," said 
Dartmouth. "Where could it have been?" 

"Her father is a Welsh baronet, and your 
estates are in the North, so you could hardly 
have known her as a child. She was educated 
in the utmost seclusion at home; no one ever 
saw her or heard of her until the fag end of the 
last London season, and she only arrived in 
Paris two days ago, and made her first 
appearance in public last night at the opera, where you 
were not. So where could you have seen 
her?" 

" I cannot imagine," said Dartmouth, 
meditatively. " But her face is dimly familiar, and it is 
a most unusual one. Tell me something about 
her; " and he resumed his seat. 



 

" She is the daughter of Sir Iltyd-ap-Penrhyn," 
said Hollington, craning his neck to catch a last 
glimpse of the disappearing beauty. " Awfully 
poor, but dates back to before Chaos. Looks 
down with scorn upon Sir Watkin Wynn, who 
hangs up the flood on the middle branch of his 
family tree. They live in a dilapitated old castle 
on the coast, and there Sir Iltyd brought up this 
tropical bird — she is an only child — and 
educated her himself. Her mother died when she 
was very young, and her father, with the 
proverbial constancy of mankind, has never been 
known to smile since. Lively for the tropical 
bird, was it not ? Lady Langdon, who was in 
Wales last year, and who was an old friend of 
the girl's mother, called on her and saw the 
professional possibilities, so to speak. She gave the 
old gentleman no peace until he told her she 
could take the girl to London, which she did 
forthwith, before he had time to change his 
mind. She has made a rousing sensation, but 
she is a downright beauty and no mistake. Lady 
Langdon evidently intends to hold on to her, for 
I see she has her still." 

" I could not have known her, of course; I 
have never put my foot in Wales. But I 
suppose I shall meet her now. Is she to be at the 
Russian Legation to-night?" 

"Yes; I have it from the best authority — 
herself. You had better go. She is worth knowing, 
I can tell you." 



 

"Well, I'll think of it," said Dartmouth. " I 
must be off now; I have no end of letters to 
write. I'll rely upon you to do the honors if I 
go! " and he took up his hat and sauntered out. 

He went directly to his apartments on the 
Avenue Champs Elys^es, and wrote a few epistles
to his impatient and much-enduring relatives 
in Britain; then, lighting a cigar, he flung
