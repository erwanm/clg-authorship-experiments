" I will, to please you ; but I don't feel right 
about it." 

" You must not be too proud, Robert," said Mr. 
Bayard, as he put the gold pieces into his hand. 

" I am not proud, sir; only I don't like to be paid 
for doing my duty." 

" Not paid, my young friend. Consider that you 
have placed me under an obligation to you for life. 
This money is only an expression of my own and my 
daughter's feelings. It is but a small sum, but I 
hope you will permit me to do something more for 
you, when you need it. Yo:i will regard me as your 
friend as long as you live." 

"Thank you, sir." 

" When you want any assistance of any kind, came 
to me. I live in Boston ; here is my business card." 

Mr. Bayajd handed him a card, on which Bobby 
read, " F. Bayard & Co., Booksellers and Publishers, No. : Washington Street, Boston," 
"You are very land, sir.'' 


" I want you should come to Boston and see us 
too," interposed Ellen. " I should be delighted to 
show you the city, to take you to the Athenaeum and 
the Museum." 

" Thank you." 

Mr. Bayard inquired of Bobby about his parents, 
where he lived, and about the circumstances of his 
family. He then took out his memorandum book, in 
which he wrote the boy's name and residence. 

" I am sorry to leave you now, Robert, but J. have 
over twenty miles to ride to-day. I should be glad 
to visit your mother, and next time I come to Riverdale, I shall certainly do so." 

'' Thank you, sir ; my mother is a very poor woman, 
but she will be glad to see you." 

" Now, good by, Robert." 

" Good by," repeated Ellen. 

" Good by." 

Mr. Bayard drove off, leaving Bobby standing on 
the bridge with the gold pieces in his hand. 

" Here's luck ! ' said Bobby, shaking the coin. 
" Won't mother's eyes stick out when she sees these 
shiners ? There are no such shiners in the river as 
these.' 




Bobby was astonished, and the more he gazed at 
the gold pieces, the more bewildered he became. He 
had never held so much money in his hand before. 
There were three large coins and one smaller one. 
He turned them over and over, and finally ascertained 
that the large coins were ten dollar pieces, and the 
smaller one a five dollar piece. Bobby was not a 
great scholar, but he knew enough of arithmetic to 
calculate the value of his treasure. He was so excited, 
however, that he did not arrive at the conclusion half 
so quick as most of my young readers would have 
done. 

" Thirty-five dollars ! " exclaimed Bobby, whei> the 
problem was solved. " Gracious I ' ! 

" Hallo, Bob ! ' shouted Tom Spicer, who had 
got tired of fishing ; besides, the village clock was 
just striking twelve, and it was time for him to go 
home. 

Bobby made no answer, but hastily tying the gold 
pieces up in the corner of his handkerchief, he threw 
the broken rail he had used in stopping the horse 
where it belonged, and started for the place where he 
had left his fishing apparatus. 



 

"Hallo, Bob!" 

"Well, Tom?" 

" Stopped him didn't you ? ' :
