Jim had nothing to say.

"Now you can go. Sam, you can stay."

"I suppose he's goin' to send me off," thought Sam.

"You may stay till to-morrow night, Sam," said the doctor, "and I will
pay you what balance I owe you. After that, I think we had better part
company. You are a little too enterprising for me."

Sam made no objection. In fact, he had got tired of the confinement,
and thought it would be an agreeable variety to return to his old life
again. The next evening, therefore, he retired from professional life,
and, with a balance of fifty cents in his possession, set up once more
as a street vagabond. When Jim Nolan paid up his indebtedness, he
would be entitled to two dollars more. Until then he was held for the
debt of his confederate.




CHAPTER XXVI.

PIPKIN'S DINING-ROOMS.

Sunday is a dull day with the street-boys, whatever their business may
be. The boot-blacks lose least, but if the day be unpropitious their
earnings are small. On such a day the Newsboys Lodge is a great
resource. It supplies all that a boy actually needs--lodging and two
meals--for the small sum of eighteen cents, and in cases of need will
trust boys to that amount.

Sam naturally had recourse to this hold on finding himself out of a
situation. He had enough to pay his expenses, and did not feel
compelled to go to work till Monday. Monday morning, however, the
reduced state of his finances compelled him to look for employment. If
he had had a little capital he might have set up as a newsboy or
boot-black, but five cents can hardly be considered sufficient capital
for either of these lines of business. Credit is the next best thing
to capital, but Sam had no credit. He found that out, after an
ineffectual attempt to borrow money of a boot-black, who, having ten
dollars in a savings-bank, was regarded in his own class with high
respect as a wealthy capitalist. The name of this exceptional young
man was William Clark, better known among the boys as Ready Money
Bill.

When twelve o'clock came, and Sam had earned nothing, he bethought
himself of Bill, the capitalist.

"Bill," he said, "I want to borrer a dollar."

"You do!" said Bill, sharply. "What for?"

"To set me up in business."

"What business?"

"Evenin' papers."

"Haven't you got no stamps?"

"No."

"What have you been doin'?"

"I've been in an office."

"Why didn't you stay?"

"The boss thought he wouldn't need me no longer."

"I see," said Bill, nodding. "You got sacked."

"Not exactly."

"Same thing."

"Will you lend me the money?"

"I'd never get it back ag'in."

"Yes, you would."

"I dunno about that. Where'd you get money to pay me back?"

"The boss owes me two dollars."

"Why don't he pay you?"

"One of my friends cheated him out of it, and he won't pay me till
it's paid back."

"May be he won't pay it back."

"Yes, he will. Will you lend me the money?"

"No, I won't. You'd ought to have saved money like I have."

"I'd have had two dollars, if Jim hadn't stolen money."
