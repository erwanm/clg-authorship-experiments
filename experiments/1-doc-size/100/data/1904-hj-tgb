It was only at a word that Charlotte had a demur. “‘Naturally’--?”

“Why, our marriage puts him for you, you see--or puts you for him--into
a new relation, whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged. It
therefore gives him more to say to you about it.”

“About its making me his stepmother-in-law--or whatever I SHOULD
become?” Over which, for a little, she not undivertedly mused. “Yes,
there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about
that.”

“Well, Amerigo can always be, according to the case, either as funny or
as serious as you like; and whichever he may be for you, in sending you
a message, he’ll be it ALL.” And then as the girl, with one of her so
deeply and oddly, yet so tenderly, critical looks at him, failed to take
up the remark, he found himself moved, as by a vague anxiety, to add a
question. “Don’t you think he’s charming?”

“Oh, charming,” said Charlotte Stant. “If he weren’t I shouldn’t mind.”

“No more should I!” her friend harmoniously returned.

“Ah, but you DON’T mind. You don’t have to. You don’t have to, I mean,
as I have. It’s the last folly ever to care, in an anxious way, the
least particle more than one is absolutely forced. If I were you,” she
went on--“if I had in my life, for happiness and power and peace, even
a small fraction of what you have, it would take a great deal to make me
waste my worry. I don’t know,” she said, “what in the world--that didn’t
touch my luck--I should trouble my head about.”

“I quite understand you--yet doesn’t it just depend,” Mr. Verver asked,
“on what you call one’s luck? It’s exactly my luck that I’m talking
about. I shall be as sublime as you like when you’ve made me all right.
It’s only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of.
It isn’t they,” he explained, “that make one so: it’s the something else
I want that makes THEM right. If you’ll give me what I ask, you’ll see.”

She had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders, and her eyes,
while she still delayed, had turned from him, engaged by another
interest, though the court was by this time, the hour of dispersal for
luncheon, so forsaken that they would have had it, for free talk, should
they have been moved to loudness, quite to themselves. She was ready
for their adjournment, but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth,
in uniform, a visible emissary of the Postes et Telegraphes, who had
approached, from the street, the small stronghold of the concierge and
who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridge-box slung
over his shoulder. The portress, meeting him on the threshold, met
equally, across the court, Charlotte’s marked attention to his visit,
so that, within the minute, she had advanced to our friends with her
cap-streamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her
broad white apron. She raised aloft a telegraphic message and, as she
delivered it, sociably discriminated. “Cette fois-ci pour madame!”--with
which she as genially retreated, leaving Charlotte in possession.
Charlotte, taking it, held it at first unopened. Her eyes had come back
to her companion, who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it. “Ah,
there you are!”

She broke the envelope then in silence, and for a minute, as with the
message he himself had put before her, studied its contents without
a sign. He watched her without a question, and at last she looked up.
“I’ll give you,” she simply said, “what you ask.”

The expression of her face was strange--but since when had a woman’s at
moments of supreme surrender not a right to be? He took it in with his
own long look and his grateful silence--so that nothing more, for some
instants, passed between them. Their understanding sealed itself--he
already felt that she had made him right. But he was in presence too
of the fact that Maggie had made HER so; and always, therefore, without
Maggie, where, in fine, would he be? She united them, brought them
together as with the click of a silver spring, and, on the spot, with
the vision of it, his eyes filled, Charlotte facing him meanwhile with
her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude. Through
it all, however, he smiled. “What my child does for me--!”

Through it all as well, that is still through the blur, he saw
Charlotte, rather than heard her, reply. She held her paper wide open,
but her eyes were all for his. “It isn’t Maggie. It’s the Prince.”

“I SAY!”--he gaily rang out. “Then it’s best of all.”

“It’s enough.”

“Thank you for thinking so!” To which he added “It’s enough for
our question, but it isn’t--is it? quite enough for our breakfast?
Dejeunons.”

She stood there, however, in spite of this appeal, her document always
before them. “Don’t you want to read it?”

He thought. “Not if it satisfies you. I don’t require it.”

But she gave him, as for her conscience, another chance. “You can if you
like.”

He hesitated afresh, but as for amiability, not for curiosity. “Is it
funny?”

Thus, finally, she again dropped her eyes on it, drawing in her lips a
little. “No--I call it grave.”
