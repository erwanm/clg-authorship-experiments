flowers, the pink moss growing in profusion amongst the 
rocks of the Gorner-Grat, and close to the snow-drifts. 

The inn on the Eiffelberg is nearly eight thousand 
feet high, â€” almost two thousand feet above the hut on 
Mount Washington ; yet it is not so cold and desolate as 
the latter. Grass grows and flowers bloom on its smooth 
upland, and behind it and in front of it are the snow- 
peaks. That evening we essayed the Gorner-Grat, a 
rocky ledge nearly ten thousand feet above the level of 
the sea ; but after a climb of an hour and a half, and a 
good view of Monte Rosa and the glaciers and peaks of 
that range, we were prevented from reaching the sum- 
mit, and driven back by a sharp storm of hail and rain. 
Tlie next morning I started for the Gorner-Grat again, 
at four o'clock. The Matterhorn lifted its huge bulk 
sharply against the sky, except where fleecy clouds 
lightly draped it and fantastically blew about it. As I 
ascended, and turned to look at it, its beautifully-cut 
peak had caught the first ray of the sun, and burned 
with a rosy glow. Some great clouds drifted high in 


the air : the summits of the Breithorn, the Lyscamm, 
and their companions, lay cold and white ; but the snow 
down their sides had a tinge of pink. When I stood 
upon the summit of the Gorner-Grat, the two prominent 
silver peaks of Monte Rosa were just touched with the 
sun, and its great snow-fields were visible to the glacier 
at its base. The Gorner-Grat is a rounded ridge of 
rock, entirely encircled by glaciers and snow-peaks. 
The panorama from it is unexcelled in Switzerland. 

Returning down the rocky steep, I descried, solitary 
in that great waste of rock and snow, the form of a lady 
whom I supposed I had left sleeping at the inn, over- 
come with the fatigue of yesterday's tramp. Lured on 
by the apparently short distance to the back-bone of the 
ridge, she had climbed the rocks a mile or more above 
the hotel, and come to meet me. She also had seen the 
great peaks lift themselves out of the gray dawn, and 
Monte Rosa catch the first rays. We stood a while 
together to see how jocund day ran hither and thither 
along the mountain-tops, until the light was all abroad, 
and then silently turned downward, as one goes from a 
mount of devotion. 



THE BATHS OF LEUK. 

IN order to make the pass of the Gemmi, it is necessary 
to go through the Baths of Leuk. The ascent from 
the Rhone bridge at Susten is full of interest, affording 
fine views of the valley, which is better to look at than 
to travel through, and bringing you almost immediately 
to the old town of Leuk, a queer, old, towered place, 
perched on a precipice, with the oddest inn, and a notice 
posted up to the effect, that any one who drives through 
its steep streets faster than a walk will be fined five 
francs. I paid nothing extra for a fast walk. The road, 
which is one of the best in the country, is a wonderful 
piece of engineering, spanning streams, cut in rock, 
rounding precipices, following the wild valley of the 
Dala by many a winding and zigzag. 

The Baths of Leuk, or Loeche-les-Bains, or Leuker- 
bad, is a little village at the very head of the valley, 
over four thousand feet above the sea, and overhung by 
the perpendicular walls of the Gemmi which rise on all 
sides, except the south, on an average of two thousand 
feet above it. There is a nest of brown houses, clus- 
tered together like bee-hives, into which the few inhabit- 
ants creep to hibernate in the long winters, and several 
shops, grand hotels, and bathing-houses open for the 
season. Innumerable springs issue out of this green, 
sloping meadow among the mountains, some of them 
icy cold, but over twenty of them hot, and seasoned 
with a great many disagreeable sulphates, carbonates, 
and oxides, and varying in temperature from ninety-five 
 





to one hundred and twenty-three degrees Fahrenheit. 
Italians, French, and Swiss resort here in great numbers 
to take the baths, which are supposed to be very effica- 
cious for rheumatism and cutaneous affections. Doubt- 
less many of them do up their bathing for the year while 
here ; and they may need no more after scalding and 
soaking in this water for a couple of months. 

Before we reached the hotel, we turned aside into one 
of the ba,th-houses. We stood inhaling a sickly steam 
in a large, close hall, which was wholly occupied by a 
huge vat, across which low partitions, with bridges, ran, 
dividing it into four compartments. When we entered, 
we were assailed with yells, in many languages, and
