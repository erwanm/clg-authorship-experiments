his hand for good-night, and this returned grasp 
held them together in silence a minute. Some- 
thing then in his sense of the situation determined 
his breaking out with an intensity not yet pro- 
duced in him. "Yes — you're really prodigious. 
I mean for trust in a fellow. For upon my hon- 
our you know nothing whatever about me." 

"That's quite what I mean," said Gray — "that 
I suffer from my ignorance of so much that's im- 
portant, and want naturally to correct it." 

"'Naturally'?" his visitor gloomed. 

"Why, I do know this about you, that when 
we were together with old Roulet at Neuchatel 
and, off on our cours that summer, had strayed 
into a high place, in the Oberland, where I was 
ass enough to have slid down to a scrap of a dizzy 
ledge, and so hung helpless over the void, unable 
to get back, in horror of staying and in greater 
horror of not, you got near enough to me, at the 
risk of your life, to lower to me the rope we so 
luckily had with us and that made an effort of 
my own possible by my managing to pass it under 
my arms. You helped that effort from a place 
of vantage above that nobody but you, in your 
capacity for playing up, would for a moment have 
taken for one, and you so hauled and steadied 
and supported me, in spite of your almost equal 
exposure, that little by little I climbed, I scram- 





 

bled, my absolute confidence in you helping, for 
it amounted to inspiration, and got near to where 
you were." 

"From which point," said Horton, whom this 
reminiscence had kept gravely attentive, "you 
in your turn rendered me such assistance, I re- 
member, though I can't for the life of me imagine 
how you contrived, that the tables were quite 
turned and I shouldn't in the least have got out 
of my fix without you." He now pulled up short 
however; he stood a moment looking down. "It 
isn't pleasant to remember." 

"It wouldn't," Gray judged, "be pleasant to 
forget. You gave proof of extraordinary cool- 
ness." 

Horton still had his eyes on the ground. "We 
both kept our heads. I grant it's a decent note 
for us." 

"If you mean we were associated in keeping 
our heads, you kept mine," Gray remarked, 
"much more than I kept yours. I should be 
without a head to-day if you hadn't seen so to 
my future, just as I should be without a heart, 
you must really let me remark, if I didn't look 
now to your past. I consider that to know that 
fact in it takes me of itself well-nigh far enough 
in appreciation of you for my curiosity, even at 
its most exasperated, to rest on a bed of roses. 
However, my imagination itself," Gray still more 
beautifully went on, "insists on making additions

— since how can't it, for that matter, picture again 
the rate at which it made them then ? I hadn't 
even at the time waited for you to save my life 
in order to think you a swell. If I thought you 
the biggest kind of one, and if in your presence 
now I see just as much as ever why I did, what 
does that amount to but that my mind isn't a 
blank about you ?" 

"Well, if mine had ever been one about you," 
said Horton, once more facing it, "our so inter- 
esting conversation here would have sufficed to 
cram it full. The least I can make of you, 
whether for your protection or my profit, is just 
that you're insanely romantic." 

"Romantic — yes," Gray smiled; "but oh, but 
oh, so systematically!" 

"It's your system that's exactly your madness. 
How can you take me, without a stroke of suc-
