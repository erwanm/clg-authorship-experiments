than it was time to turn about and go back 
again. 

Jane Bruce had spent her vacation in having 
a severe influenza, and was not strong enough 
to come back at the beginning of the term. 

Maude Clare 's sister was going to be married, 
and Maude was to stay over the wedding. 

Gypsy, left alone, invited Josephine Courtis 
to share her room with her till Jane or Maude 
came back. 

" Oh, my good gracious ! " cried Miss 
Delancey. "Why, she sha n t! Why, I wouldn't 



be hired to sleep alone one night, for any 
money you could give me. My sister Belle 
always has to sleep with me at home ; and if 
she is away visitiag, I make mother come ; or 
else I have one of the servants sleep on the 
couch. Why, I should die of fright before 
morning ! " 

"Fright! What can you find to be afraid 
of, I should like to know? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; robbers, and ghosts, 
and spiritual rappings, and fifty things. I have 
an aunt who saw her candlestick walk right 
out into the air off the mantelpiece, one night, 
and how do I know but that I should see mine 
walking, if I slept alone ! I always cover my 
head up in the clothes, anyway, and I always 
make Josephine sleep the front side; don't I, 
Jo?" 

"Were?" said contemptuous Gypsy, slowly. 
" If I enjoyed being an infant, I 'd be an infant, 
but it would be a good while before I would 
boast of it." 

" It is very nice to talk," said Jacqueline, 






colouring, " but I should like to know what 
you want of my room-mate if you re not afraid 
just as much as I am." 

" I want her because she is funny, and good 
company to have round, and I never was afraid 
to sleep alone, since I dispensed with nurses ! 
If you won't believe me, I 'll go and spend a 
night up garret, for I should be ashamed to 
have anybody think I was afraid." 

Now, the garret at the Golden Crescent was 
a dismal place; dark with cobwebs, frowning 
with shadows, ghostly with old quilts and cast- 
off garments ; moreover, the wind shrieked, 
with an extremely unpleasant sound, down the 
huge old-fashioned chimneys. Therefore, in 
credulous Jacqueline screamed at Gypsy 's pro 
posal, and said that it made her cold so much 
as to think of it. 

Gypsy made herself up a bed under the 
eaves, and at nine o'clock that night, went up, 
a stout-faced, white-robed little figure, dragging 
a pillow, and slept there, true to her word, till 
morning. 


Jacqueline went up herself at six o'clock 
to wake her, and be sure that there was no 
hoax about it. 

The girls rushed to Gypsy 's room while she 
was dressing, to hear about it. 

" How did you ever dare to? " 

" Weren't you awfully scared? " 

" Didn't you lie awake all night?" 

"And didn't you once think you saw a 
ghost?" 

" Or a candlestick walking? " 

" Oh, I wouldn't have done it for anything ! **
