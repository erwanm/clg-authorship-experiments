in the world, because you 're so unlike myself." 

Betty went with her to the door. " Go to sleep," 
she said. " Don't lie awake and think." 

"Oh, I'll sleep," she said. "Don't worry about 
that."

BETTY slept late on the following morning, but arose as 
soon as she awoke and dressed herself hurriedly. 
Senator North was an early visitor. Doubtless he was 
waiting for her on the verandah. 

She ran downstairs, feeling that she could hum a 
tune. The morning was radiant, and for the last five 
days it had seemed to her that the atmosphere was as 
black as Harriet's veil. She wanted the fresh air and 
the sunshine, the lake and the forest again . She wanted 
to talk for long hours with the one man who she was 
sure could never do a weak or cowardly act. She 
wanted to feel that her heavy responsibilities were 
pushed out of sight, and that she could live her own 
life for a little. 

She almost had reached the front door when a 
man sprang up the steps and through it, closing it 
behind him. It was John, the butler, and his face 
was white. 

" What is it ? " she managed to ask him. " What on 
earth has happened now?" 



 

"It's Miss Walker, Miss. They found her three 
hours ago on the lake. The coroner 's been here. 
They 're bringing her in. I told them to take her in 
the side door. I hoped we'd get her to her room 
before you come down. I'll attend to everything, 
Miss." 

Betty heard the slow tramp of feet on the side ve- 
randah. It was the most horrid sound she ever had 
heard, and she wondered if she should cease to hear it 
as long as she lived. She went into the living-room 
and covered her face with her hands. She had not 
cried for Jack Emory, but she cried passionately now. 
She felt utterly miserable, and crushed with a sense of 
failure ; as if all the wretchedness and tragedy of the past 
fortnight were her own making. Two lives had almost 
been given into her keeping, and in spite of her daring 
and will the unseen forces had conquered. And then 
she wondered if the water had been very cold, and 
shivered and drew herself together. And it must have 
been horribly dark. Harriet was afraid of the dark, 
and always had burned a taper at night. 

She heard Senator North come up the front steps 
and knock. As no one responded, he opened the door 
and came into the living-room. 

" I have just heard that she has drowned herself," 
he said ; and if there was a note of relief in his voice, 
Betty did not hear it. She ran to him and threw herself into his arms and clung to him. 

"You said you would," she sobbed. "And I never 
shall be in greater grief than this. I feel as if it were 
all my fault, as if I were a terrible failure, as if I had 
let two lives slip through my hands. Oh, poor poor 
Harriet ! Why are some women ever bom ? What 



 

terrible purpose was she made to live twenty-four 
wretched years for? You wanted me to become 
serious. I feel as if I never could smile again." 

He held her closely, and in that strong warm embrace she was comforted long before she would admit ; 
but he soothed her as if she were a child, and he did 
not kiss her. 






BETTY MADISON arrived in Washington two days before 
Christmas, with the sensation of having lived through 
several life-times since Lady Mary's car had left the 
Pennsylvania station on the fourteenth of March ; she 
half expected to see several new public buildings, and 
she found herself wondering if her old friends were
