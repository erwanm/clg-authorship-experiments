"And I can’t come. It is too bad. 
Oh, dear!” and she had half a mind to 
send for Cousin Jane, cross old thing 
that she was. And maybe she wouldn’t 
let her go. Cousin Jane thought so 
much liberty was the ruin of children 
nowadays. No, she could not go— that 
was all about it. 

Addie was very sorry, and Bessie could 
have cried, but there was no help for it. 
She walked a short distance down the 


 


street with her, and paused at the gate 
to speak to Sophie Lewis. Could they 
not come over a little while to-morrow 
afternoon? 

Of course they would. And if Mrs. 
Collins was away, they would have such 
fun. 

"What is it? Can’t I come, too? 
Don’t shut me out of fun,” said Carrie 
Lanliam’s gay voice. 

'If you like,” said Bessie, thinking 
that she really could not help asking 
her, and rather glad that it had so 
happened. 

‘‘We’ll have a regular frolic in the 
barn. Your barn is such a nice, clean

your blocks!’' 

She gave him a hard slap in her vexa- 
tion. 

Idl tell mother — you see!'’ and 
Freddy cried more with anger than pain. 

won’t pick up a single block, you 
ugly old thing!” 

‘‘You deserve a good whipping, that’s 
what you do!” and for a moment Bessie 
would have been delighted to administer 
it. But Mrs. Collins had forbidden the 
elder children to strike the younger ones, 
no matter what the provocation might he. 


 


So Bessie swept the porch and then 
wiped it over with the mop. It was time 
to make np the fire again. She was cross 
to Freddy, ont of temper, and as a nat- 
ural result everything went wrong. 
Supper was a little late, but so was her 
father, and Dick never reached home 
until seven. 

She went to bed shortly after her work 
was done, for she was tired and out of 
spirits. Housekeeping had not been the 
brilliant success she imagined it. But 
Freddy was so much trouble. Never 
mind, to-morrow afternoon he would he 
gone, and she and the girls could have a 
good time. 

Her father had the kettle boiling in 
the morning before he called her. The
