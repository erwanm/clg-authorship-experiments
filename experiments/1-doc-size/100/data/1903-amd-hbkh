lins! I would not be hired to step in 
your house again, and I won’t speak to- 
you this whole term ; you see if I do. ’ ’ 
Bessie went to her seat and dropped a 
few quiet tears over her book. Her 
mother knew best, of course. She 

 


thought her so strict, so almost queer at 

times, and yet it was wisest, no doubt. 

Her judgment had not brought about 

very good results, she had to confess. If 

she only could have found her mother’s 

beautiful lace ; but it never came to light. 

" Have you read the book I gave you ! ’ ’ 
Dick asked one evening when they were 
in the kitchen making candy. "But of 
course you have, and it’s just splendid, 
isn’t it?” 

Bessie’s eyes dropped and her brow 
flushed, for her cheeks were red as roses 
before. 

I— no, I haven’t,” she answered, 
with much confusion. 

"Why?” and Dick’s bright face was 
full of disappointment. ‘‘Didn’t you 
like to have it, or had you read it 
before?” 




Neither — and I was glad — only I 
did not deserve it, and I am wait- 
ing— ’ ' 

There Bessie broke down into a good 
cry. 

‘ ‘ Yon foolish little girl ! It is all about 
that broken bottle. I was cross at first 
with yon, but I felt sorry, and yon were 
so good—’’ 

‘'No, I wasn’t,” Bessie interrupted, 
wish you would let me tell you all, 
Dick; and maybe you had better take 
the book until some time when I am bet- 
ter. ’ ’ 

Dick looked up in astonishment. Was 
Bessie the author of the mischief, and 
had she told a falsehood? 

‘'Well?” Dick answered. 

So Bessie related her first morning’s 
temptation, and how she had taken out 

 


the bureau drawers to get the hidden 
story. 

‘ ‘ Mother told me to lock up any books 
I might have lying around. I would not 
have thought it of you, Bess, but, oh! 
don’t cry, it wasn’t so very bad, and you 
did not tell any story. ’ ’ 

'‘Yes, I told one to Freddy to account 
for having the drawer out, and acted one 
when you found your clothes so differ- 
ent, for somehow, when you begin—” 
Ah, Bessie, it is well to learn about the 
' Wangled web” early in life, if so be that 
it brings wisdom. 

' ‘ Oh, Bess, how lucky the bottle did not 
break— the one in the drawer, I mean. 
It had nitric acid in it. I was taking out 
a wart with it, and it would have eaten 
everything to pieces wherever it dropped. 
It wasn’t a nice thing to do, to be sure,
