with the stately blessing, " Iddio vi benedica, padre 
mio ! " 

So we left the hermitage, left Fozza, and started 
down the mountain on foot, for no one may ride 
down those steeps. Long before we reached the bot- 
tom, we had learned to loathe mountains and to long 
for dead levels during the rest of life. Yet the de- 
scent was picturesque, and in some things even more 
interesting than the ascent had been. We met more 



 

people : now melancholy shepherds with their flocks ; 
now swine-herds and swine-herdesses with herds of 
wild black pigs of the Italian breed ; now men driv- 
ing asses that brayed and woke long, loud, and most 
musical echoes in the hills ; now whole peasant fam- 
ilies driving cows, horses, and mules to the plains 
below. On the way down, fragments of autobiog- 
raphy began, with the opportunities of conversation, 
to come from the Count Giovanni, and we learned 
that he was a private soldier at home on that permesso 
which the Austrian Government frequently gives its 
less able-bodied men in times of peace. He had 
been at home some years, and did not expect to be 
again called into the service. He liked much better 
to be in charge of the cave at Oliero than to carry 
the musket, though he confessed that he liked to see 
the world, and that soldiering brought one acquainted 
with many places. He had not many ideas, and the 
philosophy of his life chiefly regarded deportment to- 
ward strangers who visited the cave. He held it an 
error in most custodians to show discontent when 
travelers gave them little ; and he said that if he re- 
ceived never so much, he believed it wise not to be- 
tray exultation. " Always be contented, and nothing 
more," said Count Giovanni. 

" It is what you people always promise beforehand," 
I said, " when you bargain with strangers, to do them 
a certain service for what they please ; but after- 
ward they must pay what you please or have trouble. 
I know you will not be content with what I give 
you." 



 

" If I am not content," cried Count Giovanni, 
" call me the greatest ass in the world ! " 

And I am bound to say that, for all I could see 
through the mask of his face, he was satisfied with 
what I gave him, though it was not much. 

He had told us casually that he was nephew of a 
nobleman of a certain rich and ancient family in Ven- 
ice, who sent him money while in the army, but this 
made no great impression on me ; and though I 
knew there was enough noble poverty in Italy to 
have given rise to the proverb, Un conte che non con- 
ta, non conta niente, yet I confess that it was with a 
shock of surprise I heard our guide and servant sa- 
luted by a lounger in Valstagna with " Sior conte, 
servitor suo ! " I looked narrowly at him, but there 
was no ray of feeling or pride visible in his pale, lan- 
guid visage as he responded, " Buona sera, caro" 

Still, after that revelation we simple plebeians, who 
had been all day heaping shawls and guide-books upon 
Count Giovanni, demanding menial offices from him, 
and treating him with good-natured slight, felt un- 
comfortable in his presence, and welcomed the ap- 
pearance of our carriage with our driver, who, hav- 
ing started drunk from Bassano in the morning, had 
kept drunk all day at Valstagna, and who now drove 
us back wildly over the road, and almost made us 
sigh for the security of mules ambitious of the brinks 
of precipices. 




I AM afraid that the talk of the modern railway 
traveler, if he is honest, must be a great deal of the 
custodians, the vetturini, and the facchini, whose agree- 
able acquaintance constitutes his chief knowledge of 
the population among which he journeys. We do not 
nowadays carry letters recommending us to citizens 
of the different places. If we did, consider the 
calamity we should be to the be-traveled Italian com 
munities we now bless ! No, we buy our through- 
tickets, and we put up at the hotels praised in the 
hand-book, and are very glad of a little conversation 
with any native, however adulterated he be by con- 
tact with the world to which we belong. I do not
