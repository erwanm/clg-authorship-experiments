"No; I must get a room outside. However, my predecessor has recommended
his--in a private house about a quarter of a mile from the shore--at
only four dollars a week."

"Then I suppose we must part," said Jed with a tinge of sadness.

"No, Jed. You shall room with me, and your room will cost you nothing.
As to meals, I can see you through till you secure some work."

"But I don't want to be a burden upon you, Mr. Bertram."

"I don't mean that you shall be, any longer than is necessary. It will
go hard if a boy like you can't find something to do that will buy his
meals at a crowded watering-place."

"Thank you, Mr. Bertram. I have money enough left to buy my meals for
two weeks at least."

"If we were at a regular office I could employ you as messenger, but
most of the messages will come to guests in the hotel."

"I don't know exactly what I can do, but I am ready to do anything."

"Except black boots," said Bertram with a smile.

"I don't think I should like to do that if there is anything else to be
found."

"I couldn't think of allowing a member of our honorable profession to
undertake such menial employment."

Harry Bertram went to work that evening. Jed kept him company in the
office a part of the time, and during the three succeeding days went
from one hotel to another to see if he could obtain anything to do.

But every position had been filled for the season. Jed began to fear
that there was no work for him at Sea Spray.

On the fourth morning, as he was sitting with Bertram, a gentleman whom
he had several times seen--a guest of the house--approached them.

"Is this boy your brother?" he asked of Bertram.

"No, but he is my valued friend. In fact, I may call myself his guardian
for the time being."

"Yes," assented Jed with a smile.

"He does not assist you?"

"No, he knows nothing of telegraphy."

"Would you like employment?" asked the gentleman, turning to Jed.

"I am very anxious to get work," said Jed quickly.

"Then I think I may be able to meet your wishes. How old are you?"

"Sixteen."

"You may have seen a boy of ten walking about with me?"

"Yes, sir."

"He is my son. He and I are here alone, but until yesterday I had a
nurse in my employ whose sole business was to look after Chester. I
felt entire confidence in her, but discovered last evening that she had
purloined some jewelry belonging to me. Of course I discharged her
instantly, and in consequence am obliged to find some one in her place.

"Chester objects to another nurse. It hurts his boyish pride to have a
woman accompanying him everywhere. It appears to me that a boy old
enough to look after him will suit him much better. But perhaps you
would not like being encumbered with a small boy?"

"I should like it very much, sir," said Jed. "I like young boys, and I
am sure I should like your son."

"Come up stairs, then. I will see how he likes you."

Jed followed his new acquaintance up to a suite of two rooms on the
second floor. A young boy was at the window. He looked inquiringly at
his father and Jed.

"Come here, Chester," said the former. "Are you quite sure you don't
want another nurse?"

"Yes," answered the boy. "Some of the boys in the hotel call me 'sissy'
because I have a girl always with me."

"Would you prefer this boy?"

Chester took a long, close look at Jed, who met his glance with a smile.

"Yes," said the little boy confidently. "I shall like him much better
than a girl."

"That settles it," said Mr. Holbrook in a tone of satisfaction. "What is
your name?"
