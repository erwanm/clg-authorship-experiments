me, sat through the twilight evenings with me, and, some- 





how, I came to be strangely comforted. I gave up my 
project for him and Daisy. She was too practical : she 
was a curious mixture of frankness and indifference ; 
sunny, but not enkindling. He needed a different nature ; 
and I doubted much whether she would be strongly 
attracted towards him. 

" So we drifted on very pleasantly. They all returned 
home at length, with Queenie's brave lover. "We had con 
sidered Fan a most fortunate girl ; but this would distance 
her complete]y. The Mallorys were old friends of the 
Duncan family : Stephen and I had met them incidentally. 
Mrs. Mallory was 'such a charming old lady ! I always 
thought she was like the solitaire diamonds she wore, 
bright, sparkling, the very finest of their kind, but not too 
much in any way. She never tired you. When she was 
going out of the room, yon wished she could stay ten min 
utes longer : when she ceased talking, you wanted to ask 
her two or three more questions. She appeared fond of 
marnma ; but she perfectly adored papa and Bessie. 

' ' I moved about them quietly. They had all distanced 
me. I was not jealous. Nelly was so happy, so handsome 
too. Fan always had her cup running over. No sorrow 
for any of them. I was glad with a pure, unalloyed glad 
ness ; but I hugged my own sorrow to my heart. 

" ' You are still fretting, Rose,' Stephen said, his brows 
drawn a little, as if somehow it displeased him. 

" ' No, I am not fretting,' I made answer almost cold 
ly. ' I have been quite quite happy.' I had meant to 
say content ; but I altered it to please him. 

" ' You don't look bright : yon are thin and pale.' 

" ' As if I could ever be bright again ! ' 

" I was sorry the moment I had uttered it. Stephen 
turned and walked away. What had come to him of late? 

" Louis found me afterward, crying, and comforted me. 

"I did not realize any of these things then. I was self 
ishly wrapped in my own grief. So long as I was not 



 

obtrusive, I thought I had a right to it. And the almost 
womanly Sympathy of Louis confirmed, instead of rous 
ing, me. Stephen appeared a good deal pro-occupied. 

" Then we made ready, and went back to the city. Bus 
iness seemed urgent and perplexing. Some evenings, 
Stephen did not get home until late ; and then he was 
tired. We had so few of those sweet little matrimonial 
privacies, that, though foolish, are very endearing between 
husband and wife, and, after all, are never meant for the 
world. I did not bother him about any thing, because I 
wanted him to rest while he was in the house ; and then 
I always had Louis. He had taken an assistantship in 
a church not far distant. I used to go to morning and 
evening praj-ers ; and yet it was not like the religion of 
my girlhood. 

" But I had not come to troubles then. 

" Was I growing any better or happier? Life seemed so 
dreary, I wanted to be away and at rest. I only thought 
of heaven, in those days, as a place of brooding bliss, 
where one might wander dreamily by the river-side, and 
pluck healing fruits to strengthen and refresh their souls 
as nothing on this earth could help them to do. I was 
calm and placid : it was not my nature to be fretful. 

" One night after we had gone to our room, Stephen sat 
down on the edge of the bed. He had been home all the 
evening, and very quiet. Louis had been explaining to 
me a guild association, that was to be in working-order 
another summer to look after sick children and weary 
mothers, and take them out of the city now and then. 
My heart had melted over the thought of the poor, wan, 
poverty-stricken babies. I was planning what I would do 
to help as I brushed out my hair. I never wore any curls 
now : they seemed sacred to baby-fingers, laid away as 
his little clothes were. 

" ' Rose,' Stephen said, ' will you come here a few 
moments? '
