of the way that the gas was burning. 

" He is in here engaged," and her guide looked rather 
disconcerted. " Mr. Graham, a lady wishes to see you." 

Mr. Graham gave a glance to the passage-way without. 

" In a moment," be responded, briefly. 

It was five, rather than one. To Madge it appeared 
almost interminable. She began to wonder whether the 
message was of so much importance, after all. 

Then Mr. Graham stepped out with his visitor, still 
talking. 

" Perhaps you had better drop in to-morrow morning 
and have a talk with father, before the business is really 
taken in hand. I start at noon, you know, and shall be 
gone six months." 

"Very well." 

The man made a slight inclination of the head, and gave 
Madge a sharp look, that startled her, bringing the color to 
her face. 

" You wished to see me ? " 

The voice had a peculiar gentlemanliness in it, that re- 
stored Madge to self-possession. Obeying the gesture of 
his hand, she followed him into the small but cheerful- 
looking office. There was a fire burning in the grate, and 
the gas was lighted. The glow and warmth were so pleasant 
that Madge involuntarily threw aside her veil. 

" I come to bring a message from my brother, Mr. Philip 
Ashburton," she said. 

A change passed over Mr. Graham's face. Indeed, it 
seemed to Madge that he was hardly pleased ; so she hur- 
riedly continued, 

" He is very ill." 

" Ill ! He was not well when he left on Tuesday, I be- 
lieve. Is it anything serious ? " 

"A fever. We are afraid " and her lip quivered. 





She sat in range of the double light, her eyes downcast, 
and their long bronze lashes drooping over her cheeks, 
that flushed and paled alternately. Not handsome, per- 
haps, to a man accustomed to seeing queens of beauty, 
but there was a delicacy and nobility about the fair young 
face which attracted his attention. 

" And the message was " 

If Madge had only glanced up to the questioning face, 
whose eyes were studying every line of hers, the result 
might have been different. But she was pre-occupied with 
her own anxieties, and doubtful of the actual necessity of 
this Htep. 

" A little trouble about some accounts, I think ; " and her 
look wandered towards the fire. " He was slightly delirious 
at least not quite coherent, and he begged me to come 
to say, that as soon as he was able, he would attend to the 
books he fancied that it might be soon. And he spoke 
of a person by the name of Howard." 

" What did he say ? " in an eager tone. 

" That he was sorry for him, and had offered to explain 
some matter. There isn't anything wrong?" and she 
glanced at him apprehensively. 

" When will your brother be able to come down, do you 
think ? " he asked. 

" Perhaps not for weeks. We are afraid he will be very, 
very ill. O, there is nothing wrong, I know ! Philip would 
cut off his right hand sooner than do anything dishonor- 
able. What is it ? " 

She came and stood by Mr. Graham, her eyes full of tears, 
and her whole frame trembling with excitement. 

" A little difficulty yes, I suppose he could explain it, 
or, if he had staid nay, do not distress yourself; it will 
all come right, I know." 

Her agitation moved him curiously. 

" What wrong is there about it ? For Philip is strictly,
