choly, and Verena was relieved when her companion 
remarked, in a moment, 'You must think me strangely 
inconsequent;' for this gave her a chance to reply, 
soothingly : 

'  Why, you don't suppose I expect you to keep always 
screwed up ! I will stay a week with Mrs. Burrage, or a 
fortnight, or a month, or anything you like,' she pursued ; 
' anything it may seem to you best to tell her after you have 
seen her.' 

' Do you leave it all to me ? You don't give me much 
help,' Olive said. 

'I Help to what ? ' 
'Help to help you? 

'I  don't want any help ; I am quite strong enough ! ' 
Verena cried, gaily. The next moment she inquired, in 
an appeal half comical, half touching, ' My dear colleague, 
why do you make me say such conceited things ? ' 

' And if you do stay just even to-morrow shall you be 
very much of the time with Mr. Ransom ? ' 

As Verena for the moment appeared ironically-minded, 
she might have found a fresh subject for hilarity in the 
tremulous, tentative tone in which Olive made this inquiry. 
But it had not that effect ; it produced the first manifesta- 
tion of impatience the first, literally, and the first note of 
reproach that had occurred in the course of their remark- 
able intimacy. The colour rose to Verena's cheek, and 
her eye for an instant looked moist. 

' I don't know what you always think, Olive, nor why 
you don't seem able to trust me. You didn't, from the first, 
with gentlemen. Perhaps you were right then I don't say ; 
but surely it is very different now. I don't think I ought 
to be suspected so much. Why have you a manner as if I 
had to be watched, as if I wanted to run away with every 
man that speaks to me ? I should think I had proved how 
little I care. I thought you had discovered by this time 
that I am serious ; that I have dedicated my life ; that there 



 

is something unspeakably dear to me. But you begin again, 
every time you don't do me justice. I must take every- 
thing that comes. I mustn't be afraid. I thought we had 
agreed that we were to do our work in the midst of the world, 
facing everything, keeping straight on, always taking hold. 
And now that it all opens out so magnificently, and victory 
is really sitting on our banners, it is strange of you to doubt 
of me, to suppose I am not more wedded to all our old 
dreams than ever. I told you the first time I saw you that 
I could renounce, and knowing better to-day, perhaps, what 
that means, I am ready to say it again. That I can, that I 
will ! Why, Olive Chancellor,' Verena cried, panting, a 
moment, with her eloquence, and with the rush of a 
culminating idea, ' haven't you discovered by this time that 
I have renounced ? ' 

The habit of public speaking, the training, the practice, 
in which she had been immersed, enabled Verena to unroll 
a coil of propositions dedicated even to a private interest 
with the most touching, most cumulative effect. Olive 
was completely aware of this, and she stilled herself, while 
the girl uttered one soft, pleading sentence after another, 
into the same rapt attention she was in the habit of sending 
up from the benches of an auditorium. She looked at 
Verena fixedly, felt that she was stirred to her depths, that 
she was exquisitely passionate and sincere, that she was a 
quivering, spotless, consecrated maiden, that she really had 
renounced, that they were both safe, and that her own in- 
justice and indelicacy had been great. She came to her 
slowly, took her in her arms and held her long giving her 
a silent kiss. From which Verena knew that she believed 
her. 



XXXII. 

THE hour that Olive proposed to Mrs. Burrage, in a note 
sent early the next morning, for the interview to which she 
consented to lend herself, was the stroke of noon; this 
period of the day being chosen in consequence of a 
prevision of many subsequent calls upon her time. She 
remarked in her note that she did not wish any carriage to 
be sent for her, and she surged and swayed up the Fifth 
Avenue on one of the convulsive, clattering omnibuses 
which circulate in that thoroughfare. One of her reasons 
for mentioning twelve o'clock had been that she knew Basil 
Ransom was to call at Tenth Street at eleven, and (as she 
supposed he didn't intend to stay all day) this would give 
her time to see him come and go. It had been tacitly 
agreed between them, the night before, that Verena was 
quite firm enough in her faith to submit to his visit, and that
