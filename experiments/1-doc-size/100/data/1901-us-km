Occasionally she raised her voice and shouted David’s name, but
still she got no reply, and her anxiety soon changed into alarm, and
she was hurrying along, almost in a run. In this way she climbed the
long ascent which the road made from the lake shore; and when she
had reached the top of it she gathered her breath and shouted once
more, louder and more excitedly than ever.

This time she heard the expected reply, and found that David was
only a few rods ahead of her. “What is the matter?” she called to
him, and as he answered that it was nothing, but to come to him, she
ran on more alarmed than ever.

There was just light enough for her to see that David was bending
down; and then as she got very near she saw that on the ground in
front of him was lying a dark, shadowy form. As Helen cried out
again to know what was the matter, her husband said, “Do not be
frightened, dear; it is only some poor woman that I have found here
by the roadside.”

“A woman!” the girl echoed in wonder, at the same time giving a gasp
of relief at the discovery that her husband was not in trouble.
“Where in the world can she have come from, David?”

“I do not know,” he answered, “but she probably wandered off the
main road. It is some poor, wretched creature, Helen; she has been
drinking, and is quite helpless.”

And Helen stood still in horror, while David arose and came to her.
“You are out of breath, dear,” he exclaimed, “why did you come so
fast?”

“Oh, I was so frightened!” the girl panted. “I cannot tell you,
David, what happens in my heart whenever I think of your coming to
any harm. It was dreadful, for I knew something serious must be the
matter.”

David put his arm about her and kissed her to quiet her fears; then
he said, “You ought not to have come out, dear; but be calm now, for
there is nothing to worry you, only we must take care of this poor
woman. It is such a sad sight, Helen; I wish that you had not come
here.”

“What were you going to do?” asked the girl, forgetting herself
quickly in her sympathy.

“I meant to come down and tell you,” was David’s reply; “and then go
back to town and get someone to come and take her away.”

“But, David, you can never get back over that rough road in the
darkness!” exclaimed Helen in alarm; “it is too far for you to walk,
even in the daytime--I will not let you do it, you must not!”

“But dear, this poor creature cannot be left here; it will be a
bitter cold night, and she might die.”

Helen was silent for a moment in thought, and then she said in a
low, trembling voice: “David, there is only one thing to do.”

“What is that, dear?” asked the other.

“We will have to take her home with us.”

“Do you know what you are saying?” asked the other with a start;
“that would be a fearful thing to do, Helen.”

“I cannot help it,” she replied, “it is the only thing. And it would
be wicked not to be willing to do that, because she is a woman.”

“She is in a fearful way, dear,” said the other, hesitatingly; “and
to ask you to take care of her--”

“I would do anything sooner than let you take that walk in such
darkness as this!” was the girl’s reply; and with that statement she
silenced all of his objections.

And so at last David pressed her hand, and whispered, “Very well,
dear, God will bless you for it.” Then for a while the two stood in
silence, until Helen asked, “Do you think that we can carry her,
poor creature?”

“We may try it,” the other replied; and Helen went and knelt by the
prostrate figure. The woman was muttering to herself, but she seemed
to be quite dazed, and not to know what was going on about her.
Helen did not hesitate any longer, but bent over and strove to lift
her; the woman was fortunately of a slight build, and seemed to be
very thin, so that with David’s help it was easy to raise her to her
feet. It was a fearful task none the less, for the poor wretch was
foul with the mud in which she had been lying, and her wet hair was
streaming over her shoulders; as Helen strove to lift her up the
head sunk over upon her, but the girl bit her lips together grimly.
She put her arm about the woman’s waist, and David did the same on
the other side, and so the three started, stumbling slowly along in
the darkness.

“Are you sure that it is not too much for you?” David asked; “we can
stop whenever you like, Helen.”

“No, let us go on,” the girl said; “she has almost no weight, and we
must not leave her out here in the cold. Her hands are almost frozen
now.”
