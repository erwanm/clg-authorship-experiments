for supper. 

I could feel that father was hurt and amazed by his 
indifference at the table, which went almost to the 
verge of rudeness. Afterward he took his hat and 
marched out. I tried to make amends. I felt fie would 
not have acted so if he had been perfectly sober. 



CHAPTER XVI 

HER RIVALS 

OF course we kept our guest all night. It was mid 
night when Dan came home, and I pretended to be 
asleep. But he was quite cheerful the next morning. 
Chicago people were generally hospitable. There were 
new families coming in almost penniless, one may 
say, and they were helped upon their feet in the friend 
liest manner. It had seemed to me that Dan had a 
large and generous soul, but he did not show it now. I 
felt heartbroken. 

We were to go down to the newspaper office. John 
thought he should like that above all things. 

"I've never had half a chance at books," John said 
laughingly. "I had about made up my mind to study 
and get a district school. In a certain way I like farm 
ing, but it's not so easy in our old State. Here it must 
be splendid, inspiring ! But a newspaper ! That looks 
like fairyland to me. Cousin Ruth, I'm like a girl about 
fairy stories and King Arthur and Odin and all those 
old heroes." 

That sounded like Norman, and warmed my inmost 
heart. 





Fortunately we found Mr. Bayne and Mr. Wight 
both in. I think they were quite taken with young 
John. I wondered at his sort of aplomb for a country 
lad. He was no braggart, but he did seem to have a 
clear estimate of himself, and to most questions he said 
so cheerfully "I'd like to learn." 

The upshot of it was that he was to come for a week 
and try. Then Mr. Wight talked about Chris. Being 
a clergyman himself, he was taking a fervent interest 
in the lad. 

We let father go home, and we took a walk about 
old Fort Dearborn, and talked western history, which 
interested him very much, as he had only the vaguest 
idea about the West. In spite of last evening, I had a 
light-hearted feeling, as if I was the Little Girl of the 
past going about with Norman. 

On our homeward way, just as I attempted to cross 
the street, a carriage halted. There were two women 
in it, and one leaned out calling to me laughingly 
"Ruth Gaynor Ruth Hayne!" 

I drew a long breath of utter amazement, and simply 
stared. But for thin, pale Mrs. Morrison I certainly 
should not have recognized Polly. She was a hand 
some woman and dressed in the richest manner. She 
seemed all of a glitter from her shining, rippling hair, 
the bronze feathers blowing about her hat, the cloud of 
lace around her neck with gold threads in it, and the 
glistening silk gown. On her one bare hand shone a 
circlet of diamonds, on her wrist a bracelet. 

"Oh," I ejaculated, drawing in a long breath of 
surprise. 



 

"If you had met me in a pudding pot you wouldn't 
have known me," and she laughed with an amused 
gayety. "You might get stirred up in the mush, but I 
wouldn't, I'm too large." 

"Polly Morrison," was all I could say. 

"I came yesterday afternoon. This is my first visit 
home, though I've trotted up and down the Missis 
sippi until I know every turn and every town. I have 
a husband who hardly lets me out of his sight and he 
has never found it convenient to come to Chicago. 
Perhaps he is afraid he might see some other woman 
he would like for a wife, he had such astonishing luck 
before. And how Chicago has changed! All the old 
houses have been built on to, and the stores and ware
