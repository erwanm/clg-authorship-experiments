again. He rested in her dainty vicinity, the quiet 
things she said, the sound of her voice, the delicacy 
of her dress, in herself. He forgot for one de 
licious hour the real and rugged world in which 
she lived. Or rather, perhaps, if he analyzed his 
feeling, he had a vague sense of mastery, as 
stimulating as it was unprecedented, as if he himself 
were the agent, not the subject, of a new experience, 
in which he drew her from a consecration to 
a dream. 



 

He asked her to play to him. 

" No," she said, " you are a Bostonian." 

" But not a critic." 

" Impossible ! You approve the Handel and 
Haydn, and patronize the Symphony. You do 
your duty by the prevailing artists ; hold them at 
arm 's length as I do my last new babies, with 
about the same complacency in their existence, as 
if the Creator had an obligation to you for the 
fact. You are like the man who declined to be a 
vegetarian on the ground that pdte defoie gras 
was good enough for him. I had a patient once 
who abandoned smoking because his taste had de 
veloped so fastidious a quality that he could find 
no tobacco fine enough for him." 

"I am still a crude smoker. Play to me; 
please ! " 

"I know two tunes: one is China, and the 
other isn't . Which will you have ? " 

" The other one. Play to me ! " 

" It is a Scotch song. Do you like Scotch 



" Do you sing ? " 

" Not in the least. I can play you the accom 
paniment." 

He made a little movement of impatience. He 
was by nature of a restless, not to say an imperious 
temper which his illness (or perhaps it would 
be more precise to say, his physician) had subdued 
rather than excited. 

Her ready merriment came to her eyes. 
 "You cannot make me believe," he insisted, 
" that you are not musical. Physicians are." 

" That is true enough," she answered, quickly 
warming to the subject. " Science is harmony. 
Music ancl science are twins. Music is the femi 
nine, though, I think." 

" It is a fine marriage. Oh, you call them 
twins, though." 

" You are not so far out of the way. There is 
nn element of twinship in all absolute marriage." 
This was said with her scientific expression, as if 
she were dissecting a radial artery. 

" How many absolute marriages have you 
known ? " asked Yorke, as nearly as possible in 
the same tone. 

" Just three," said Dr. Doctor Zay. 

" In all your experience ? Only three that 
would that you would have been satisfied 
with ? " 

" It is not a question of what would satisfy one 's 
self," she said, freezing swiftly and slightly, like 
thin November ice. "It is a matter of psychological 
investigation." 



 

" What a horrible advantage over mankind 


your -profession gives ! " said Yorke, between his 
teeth. She nodded gravely. 

" It is unmatched, I believe. Even the clergy :
