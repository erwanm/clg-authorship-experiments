When are you coming up again ? " 

" I don't know. Next week, some time." 

" Come in and see me — and Alan, if he should be 
at home. He likes you, and he will be so glad." 

Mary kissed Bessie for consent. " You know how 
much I admire Alan. He could be anything." 

" Yes, he could. If he could ! " 

Bessie seldom put so much earnest in anything, and 
Mary loved (as she would have said) the sad sincerity, 
the honest hopelessness of her tone. " We must help 
him. I know we can." 

"We must try. But people who could — " they 
could — " Bessie stopped. 

Her friend divined that she was no longer speaking 
wholly of her brother, but she said : " There isn't any 
if about it; and there are no ifs about anything if we 
only think so. It's a sin not to think so." 

The mixture of severity and of optimism in the 
nature of her friend had often amused Bessie, and it 
did not escape her tacit notice in even so serious a 
moment as this. Her theory was that she was shocked 
to recognize it now, because of its relation to her 
brother, but her theories did not always agree with 
the facts. 

That evening, however, she was truly surprised 
when, after a rather belated ring at the door, the card 
of Mr. Thomas JefEerson Durgin came up to her from 
the reception-room. Her aunt had gone to bed, and 
she had a luxurious moment in which she reaped all 



 

the reward of self-denial by supposing herself to have 
foregone the pleasure of seeing him, and sending 
down word that she was not at home. She did not 
wish, indeed, to see him, bat she wished to know how 
he felt warranted in calling in the evening, and it was 
this unworthy curiosity which she stifled for that lux- 
urious moment. The next, with undiminished dignity, 
she said, " Ask him to come up, Andrew," and she 
waited in the library for him to offer a justification 
of the liberty he had taken. 

He offered none whatever, but behaved at once as 
if he had always had the habit of calling in the even- 
ing, or as if it was a general custom which he need 
not account for in his own case. He brought her a 
book which they had talked of at their last meeting, 
but he made no excuse or pretext of it. 

He said it was a beautiful night, and that he had 
found it rather warm walking in from Cambridge. 
The exercise had moistened his whole rich, red color, 
and fine drops of perspiration stood on his clean-shav- 
en upper-lip and in the hollow between his under-lip 
and his bold chin ; he pushed back the coarse, dark- 
yellow hair from his forehead with his handkerchief, 
and let his eyes mock her from under his thick, straw- 
colored eyebrows. She knew that he was enjoying 
his own impudence, and he was so handsome that she 
could not refuse to enjoy it with him. She asked him 
if he would not have a fan, and he allowed her to get 
it for him from the mantel. " Will you have some 
tea?" 

" No ; but a glass of water, if you please," he said. 



 

and Bessie rang and sent for some Apollinaris, which 
JeS drank a great goblet of when it came. Then he 
lay back in the deep chair he had taken, with the air 
of being ready for any little amusing thing she had 
to say. 

" Are you still a pessimist, Mr. Durgin ? " she asked, 
tentatively, with the effect of innocence that he knew 
meant mischief. 

" No," he said. " I'm a reformed optimist." 

" What is that ? " 

" It's a man who can't believe all the good he would 
like, but likes to believe all the good he can." 

Bessie said it over, with burlesque thoughtfulness
