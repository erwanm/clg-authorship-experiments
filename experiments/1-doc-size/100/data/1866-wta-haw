" I saw you were going on the rocks, and I 
shouted and made signs for you to keep off." 

" You certainly did all you could for us, both 
before and after the accident," added Mr. Sherwood, 
"When did you get home, Lawry ? " 

" To-day noon, just after you went to the house 
for me. I came right up to see you ; but I found 
you had gone." 

" Yes ; I was so impatient to get that little 
steamer up here, that I couldn't wait any longer." 

" And what a waste your haste has made ! " laughed 
Mrs. Sherwood. " There is our fine little steamer 
at the bottom of the lake." 

" She may lie there, for all me," added Mr. Sher- 
wood, impatiently. 

"I should not dire to put my foot on board of 
her again," said Miss Fanny. 

" Nor I," chimed in Fanny Jane. 



 



" She isn't to blame, Mr. Sherwood," interposed 
Ethan French. " She worked as well as though 
she had been alive." 

" No steamer could stand such a thump on the 
Goblins," added Lawry. 

" I don't blame the boat, of course," replied Mr. 
Sherwood ; " but this adventure has cured me of my 
love for steamboating. I don't want to see another 
one." 

" Shall you let the Woodville lie there ? " asked 
Lawry. 

■ "She's a week now, stove in and ruined." 

" But she can be raised and repaired, and be as 
good as ever, or nearly so," continued Lawry, who 
could not bear to lose the bright anticipations held 
out to him by the advent of the fairy craft. 

" She is good for nothing to me now. I will 
give her to any one who wants her." 

" There are plenty who will want her," said 
Lawry. 

" It will cost them a fortune to raise and repair 
her — almost as much as she is worth, if she is to 
be used as a plaything. But I have come to the 







conclusion that she is a dangerous machine for me, 
and I don't want anything more to do with her. 
I came very near drowning my wife and my friends 
with her ; and this fills me with disgust for the boat 
and for myself." 

" Just now you spoke of a reward for what I had 
the good luck to do for you, Mr. Sherwood," con- 
tinued Lawry, timidly. 

" I did ; and you may be assured I shall nevei 
forget your noble conduct," replied Mr. Sherwood, 
warmly. 

" If you are going to give the Woodville away, 
sir, " 

" Well, what ? " asked Mr. Sherwood, as the 
young pilot paused. 

" I don't know as I ought to say what I was 
going to say." 

" Say it, Lawry, say it," added Mr. Sherwood, 
kindly. 

" You said you would give the steamer to any one 
who wanted her," continued Lawry, hesitating. 

" And you want her ? " laughed the wealthy gen-
