'I am quite ready to believe it. The transaction has 
been as providential for me as for the Signor Marchese.' 

' Yes,' answered the prince rather drily. ' And now, 
my dear Meschini, will you leave me for a time ? I have 
appointed this hour to see my last remaining daughter con 
cerning her marriage. She is the last of those fair flowers ! 
Ah me ! How sad a thing it is to part with those we love 



 

so well ! But we have the consolation of knowing that it is 
for their good, that consolation, that satisfaction which only 
come to us when we have faithfully done our duty. Return 
to your library, therefore, Meschini, for the present. The 
consciousness of good well done is yours also to-day, and will 
soothe the hours of solitude and make your new labours 
sweet. The reward of righteousness is. in itself and of itself. 

Good-bye, my friend, good-bye ! Thank you, thank you ' 

' Would it be agreeable to your Excellency to let me have 
the money now ? ' asked the librarian. There was a firmness 
in the tone that startled Montevarchi. 

' What money ? ' he inquired with a well- feigned surprise. 
' I do not understand.' 

' Twenty thousand scudi, the price of the work,' replied 
Meschini with alarming bluntness. 

' Twenty thousand scudi ! ' cried the prince. ' I remem 
ber that there was some mention of a sum two thousand, I 
think, I said. Even that is enormous, but I was carried 
away in the excitement of the moment. We are all liable 
to such weakness ' 

' You agreed to pay me twenty thousand scudi in cash on 
the day that the verdict was given in favour of your son-in- 
law.' 

' I never agreed to anything of the kind. My dear friend, 
success has quite turned your head ! I have not so much 
money at my disposal in the whole world.' 

' You cannot afford to make a fool of me,' cried Meschini, 
making a step forward. His face was red with anger, and 
his long arms made odd gestures. ' Will you pay me the 
money or not ? ' 

' If you take this tone with me I will pay you nothing 
whatever. I shall even cease to feel any sense of grati 
tude ' 

' To hell with your gratitude ! ' exclaimed the other 
fiercely. ' Either you pay me the money now, or I go at 
once to the authorities and denounce the whole treachery.' 

' You will only go to the galleys if you do.' 

' You will go with me.' 

' Not at all. Have you any proof that I have had any-

thing to do with the matter ? I tell you that you are quite 
mad. If you wanted to play this trick on me you should 
have made me sign an agreement. Even then I would have 
argued that since you had forged the documents you had, of 
course, forged the agreement also. But you have nothing, 
not so much as a scrap of paper to show against me. Be 
reasonable and I will be magnanimous. I will give you the 
two thousand I spoke of in the heat of anticipation ' 

'You will give me the twenty thousand you solemnly 
promised me,' said Meschini, with concentrated anger. 

Montevarchi rose slowly from his chair and rang the bell. 
He knew that Meschini would not be so foolish as to expose 
himself, and would continue to hope that he might ultimately 
get what he asked. 

' I cannot argue with a madman,' he said calmly. 

He was not in the least afraid of the librarian. The idea 
never entered his mind that the middle-aged, round-shouldered 
scholar could be dangerous. A single word from Gouache, 
a glance of the artist's eye had cowed him less than an hour
