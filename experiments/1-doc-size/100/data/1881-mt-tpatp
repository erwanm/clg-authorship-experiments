all that troubles thee. For Miles Hendon is master 
of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. He will 
remain — doubt it not.” 


CHAPTER XXVI 


DISOWNED 

The king sat musing a few moments, then looked 
up and said: 

“’Tis strange — most strange. I cannot account 
for it.” 

“No, it is not strange, my liege. I know him, 
and this conduct is but natural. He was a rascal 
from his birth.” 

“Oh, I spake not of him. Sir Miles.” 

“Not of him? Then of what? What is it that 
is strange?” 

“That the king is not missed.” 

“How? Which? I doubt I do not understand.” 
“Indeed! Doth it not strike you as being passing 
strange that the land is not filled with couriers 
and proclamations describing my person and making 
.search for me? Is it no matter for commotion and 
distress that the head of the state is gone? — that I 
am vanished away and lost?” 

“Most true, my king, I had forgot.” Then 
Hendon sighed, and muttered to himself, “Poor 
ruined mind — still busy with its pathetic dream.” 

“But I have a plan that shall right us both. I 
will write a paper, in three tongues — Latin, Greek, 
and English — and thou shalt haste away with it to 
London in the morning. Give it to none but my 
uncle, the Lord Hertford; when he shall see it, he 
will know and say I wrote it. Then he will send 
for me.” 

“Might it not be best, my prince, that we wait 
here until I prove myself and make my rights secure 
to my domains? I should be so much the better 
able then to — ” 

The king interrupted him imperiously; 

“Peace! "What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial 
interests, contrasted with matters which concern 
the weal of a nation and the integrity of a 
throne!” Then he added, in a gentle voice, as if 
he were sorry for his severity, “Obey and have no 
fear; I will right thee, I will make thee whole — yes, 
more than whole. I shall remember, and requite.” 

So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to 
work. Hendon contemplated him lovingly awhile, 
then said to himself: 

“An it were dark, I should think it was a king 
that spoke; there’s no denjdng it, when the humor’s 
upon him he doth thimder and lighten like your 
true king — now where got he that trick? See him 
scribble and scratch away contentedly at his 
meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to be Latin and 
Greek — and except my wit shall serve me with a 
lucky device for diverting him from his purpose, I 
shall be forced to pretend to post away to-morroW 
on this wild errand he hath invented for me.” 

The next moment Sir Miles’s thoughts had gone 
back to the recent episode. So absorbed was he in 
his muans, that when the king presently handed 
him the paper which he had been writing, he received 
it and pocketed it without being conscious of the 
act. “How marvelous strange she acted,” he mut- 
tered. “I think she knew me — and I think she did 
not know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive 
it plainly; I cannot reconcile them, neither can I, 
by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even 
persuade one to outweigh the other. The matter 
standeth simply thus; she must have known my face, 
my figure, my voice, for how could it be otherwise? 
yet she said she knew me not, and that is proof 
perfect, for she cannot lie. But stop — I think I 
begin to see. Peradventure he hath influenced her 
— commanded her — compelled her to lie. That is 
the solution ! The riddle is unriddled. She seemed 
dead with fear — yes, she was under his compulsion. 
I will seek her; I will find her; now that he is away, 
she will speak her true mind. She will remember 
the old times when we were little playfellows together,
and this will soften her heart, and she will
