responding with his paper, and, in the eyes of 
many, eclipsing Blowitz.'' 

" Who is Blowitz?'' 

"Mon dieu! Mon dieu! But after all 
London is farther off than New York, and I 
don't fancy you read the Times when you are 
there — which is briefly and seldom. Paris is 
our Mecca. Well, Blowitz — " 

"But Madeleine? Madeleine? It is about 
her we want to hear. What do we care about 
tiresome political letters in solemn old news- 
papers? How did she look? How dressed? 
Was she ahead of the mode as ever? Does she 
look much older? Does she show what she 
has been through . , . Oh, Antoinette — 
Mrs. McLane — Mamma — how tiresome you 
are!" 

Mrs. Abbott had not joined in this chorus. 
She had emitted a series of grunts — no less 
primitive word expressing her vocal emissions 
when disgusted. She now had four chins, her 



 

eyes were alarmingly protuberant, and her face, 
what with the tight lacing in vogue, much good 
food and wine, and a pious disapproval of 
powder or any care of a complexion which 
should remain as God made it, was of a deep 
mahogany tintj but her hiand still held the iron 
rod, and if its veins had risen its muscles had 
never grown flaccid. 

"Abominable!" she ejaculated when she 
could make herself heard. " To think that a 
man and a woman like that should be rewarded 
by fame and prosperity. They were thoroughly 
bad and should have been pxmished accord- 
ingly." 

" Oh, no, they were not bad, ma chere," said 
Mrs. McLane lightly. " They were much too 
good. That was the whole trouble. And you 
must admit that for their temporary fall from 
grace they were sufficiently pimished, poor 
things." 

"Antoinette, I am surprised." Mrs. Ballinger spoke as severely as Mrs. Abbott. She 
looked less the Southerner for the moment than 
the Puritan. " They disgraced both themselves 
and Society. I was glad to hear of their reform, but they should have continued to live 



 

in sadcdoth for the rest of their lives. For 
such to enjoy happiness and success is to shake 
the whole social structure, and it is a blow to 
the fundamental laws of religion and morality." 

" But perhaps they are not happy, mamma,'' 
Maria spdce hopefully, although the fates 
seemed to have nothing in pickle for her erratic 
mate. " Mrs. McLane has not yet told us — " 

"Oh, but they are! Quite the happiest 
couple I have ever seen, and likely to remain 
so. That's a case of true love if ever there 
was one. I mislaid my skepticism all the time 
I was in Berlin — a whole month!" 

"Abominable!'' nunbled Mrs. Abbott. 
"And when I think of poor Howard — dead of 
apoplexy — " 

"Howard ate too much, was too fond of 
Burgundy, and grew fatter every year. Made- 
leine could reclaim Masters, but she never had 
any influence over Howard." 

" Well, she could have waited — " 

" Masters was pulled up in the nick of time. 
A year more of that horrible life he was leading 
and he would have been either unreclaimable 
or dead. It makes me believe in Fate — and 
I am a good Churchwoman." 



 

" It's a sad world," commented Mrs. Ballinger with a sigh. " I confess I don't understand it. When I think of Sally — ''
