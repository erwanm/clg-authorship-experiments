but an uneasy night. 

" I had supposed the old man had principles 
about Sunday travel," he said to his wife, " but it 
seems he is coming in the morning, after all. He 
might at least have sent me word." 

" Telegraphing in the country is difficult, 
sometimes, I have heard," replied the lady, vaguely. 
She was a handsome, childless woman, with the 
haughty under lip of her class. Her husband spoke 
cheerily, but he was not at ease, and she did not 
know how to make him so. 




The Sunday morning train came in from the 
country station forty miles back, but the old clergy 
man was not among its passengers. Now thoroughly 
alarmed, the vestryman had started for his hat and 
coat, when his parlor-maid brought him a message. 
It had been left at the door, she said, by a 
messenger who brooked neither delay nor question, but 
ordered her to tell the master of the house that the 
supply for Saint Agatha's was in the city, and would 
meet the engagement at the proper time and place. 
The old clergyman, the messenger added, had been 
suddenly stricken with a dangerous illness, and 
could not be expected; but his substitute would 
fill the pulpit for the day. The vestryman was 
requested to feel no concern in the matter. The 
preacher preferred retirement until the hour of the 
service, and would fulfil his duties at the church at 
the appointed hour. 

But when the vestryman, feeling flurried despite 
himself, tapped at the door of the luxurious vestry- 
room, gracefully refurnished that winter for the 
rector with the sore throat who was in the south of 
France, he found it locked ; and to his unobtrusive 
knock no answer came. At this uncomfortable moment 
the sexton tiptoed up to say that the supply 




had requested not to be disturbed until the service 
should begin. The sexton supposed that the clergy 
man needed extra preparation ; thought that perhaps 
the gentleman was from the country, and ah 
unused to the audience. 

" What is his name ? What does he look like ? " 
asked the chairman, with knotted brows. 

" I have not seen him sir,' replied the sexton, 
with a puzzled expression. 

" How did you receive the message ? " 

" By a messenger who would not be delayed or 
questioned." 

Struck by the repetition of this phrase, the chair 
man asked again : 

" But what did the messenger look like ? " The 
sexton shook his head. 

" I cannot tell you, sir. He was a mere messen 
ger. I paid no attention to him." 

" Very well," said the church officer, turning 
away discontentedly. " It must be all right. I have 
implicit confidence in the man whose chosen substitute
this is." 

With this he ceased to try to intrude himself 
upon the stranger, but went down to his pew, and 
sat beside his wife in uneasy silence. 



The chimes sang and sank, and sang again : 

Holy, holy, holy 

The air was so clear that the sound rang twice 
the usual distance through the snowlit, sunlit air ; 
and the sick and the old at home listened to the 
bells with a sudden stirring at their feeble hearts, 
and wished again that they could have gone to 
church. One bed-ridden woman, whose telephone 
connected her with Saint Agatha's, held the receiver 
to her sensitive ear, and smiled with the quick 
gratitude for trifling pleasures of the long sick, as 
she recognized the notes of the chime. With a leap 
and a thrill as if they cast their metal souls out in 
the act, the voices of the bells rose and swelled, and
