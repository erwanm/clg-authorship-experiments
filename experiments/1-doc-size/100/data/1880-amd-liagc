stolen goods, or rather who passed on valuables and made 





bargains. And when any one wanted a child for any spe- 
cial purpose, this man, it seems, managed to get possession 
of the required article." 

"And this in our own city! You amaze me." 

" Mell said that children were sometimes taken there 
and kept for big rewards, sometimes sold to street musi- 
cians, and for various purposes." 

" But we offered a reward," said Mr. Byington. 

" Yes. Mell had no idea the child was valuable. She 
had no rich clothes or jewelry about her. But after she 
heard, she tried to get her back, and this man, Retzer, had 
sold her again." 

"That sounds incredible, Tim." 

" But this is the cruellest part. She would not tell Ret- 
zer, lest he might claim the reward, and he would give her 
no information as to where the child had really gone. To 
think that she might have been found ! And oh, sir, not 
to know anything about her ! Why, she would be a young 
lady by this time I counted it up. She was such a 
beautiful little thing! I can see her now, just like a pic- 
ture. Mell thinks she was taken out of the city." 

"But this man, Retzer, did you call him, can we 
not find him, Tim ? Money would be no object. There 
is her father." 

"Oh, sir, isn't it hard?" and Tim winked away some 
tears. "Mell told me where he was, and I went to the 
place. It had been a regular hole, a resort for thieves and 
desperadoes. In April the property was sold, and the 
houses torn down. They are going to build a row of brick 
tenements. And Retzer went to Germany sailed the 
twentieth of April." 

" There certainly is a fatality attending the child. We 
seem to come upon the traces always too late. You are 
sure this Mell told the truth ?" 

" Oh, yes. She seemed sorry and penitent like, and 
when I told her Nora's father had come back, and was a 





great gentleman, the tears just rolled out of her eyes, for 
she was too weak to cry. The doctor said she had been 
dying for hours. She couldn't have told such a lie with 
her last breath, when she could barely speak." 

" No, Tim, that would be too terrible. But if she had 
spoken sooner ! " 

" I found a friend of Retzer's they're all mighty sus- 
picious, sir, unless it is of people like themselves. I 
learned that he had a brother at Hamburg, and have the 
address. I made this man believe it would be greatly to 
Retzer's advantage, and I hardly think he would deceive 
so grossly." 

"You have a long head, Tim," and Mr. Byington 
smiled. "I know a mercantile house at Hamburg, and 
they can do the business through some attorney. We 
will offer a liberal reward for the information." 

" Couldn't her father do something ? " asked the young 
man, eagerly. 

"Why, yes. How stupid not to think of it. And yet 
it seems such a painful story to tell him. But we had bet- 
ter. Will you give me the address?" 

Tim produced it, and also the confession, to which 
Mother Mell had appended her scrawl, in the presence of 
the physician. 

" I shall spare no pains, and yet I have very little hope. 
If we should find her, with the changes and chances of 
years between " 

" Oh, sir, she couldn't be anything but what she was 
then. I can't fancy her growing loud and coarse and 
common. I am only afraid that she has been hardly used ; 
and she was such a sweet little angel. Maybe I'd better 
not have taken her in when she clung to me so that day." 

"Oh, Tim, don't reproach yourself. But for you we 
might not even have known these few facts."
