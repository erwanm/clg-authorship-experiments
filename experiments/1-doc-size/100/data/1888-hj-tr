tion. Without Mr. Flack, at the cafes, he felt too 
much like a non-consumer. But he was patient 
and ruminant ; Gaston Probert grew to like him 
and tried to invent amusements for him ; took him 
to see the great markets, the sewers and the Bank 
of France, and put him in the way of acquiring 
a beautiful pair of horses (it is perhaps not superfluous to say that tins was a perfectly straight 
proceeding on the young man s part), which Mr. 
Dosson, little as he resembled a sporting character, 
found it a welcome pastime on fine afternoons to 
drive, with a highly scientific hand, from a smart 
Americaine, in the Bois de Boulogne. There was 
a reading-room at the banker s, where he spent 
hours engaged in a manner best known to himself, 
and he shared the great interest, the constant topic 
of his daughters the portrait that was going 
forward in the Avenue de Villiers. This was the 
subject round which the thoughts of these young 
ladies clustered and their activity revolved ; it 
gave a large scope to their faculty for endless repetition, for monotonous insistence, for vague and 
aimless discussion. On leaving Mme. de Brecourt 
Francie s lover had written to Delia that he de 
sired half an hour s private conversation with her 
father on the morrow at half-past eleven ; his im 
patience forbade him to wait for a more canonical 
hour. He asked her to be so good as to arrange 
that Mr. Dosson should be there to receive him 
and to keep Francie out of the way. Delia ac 
quitted herself to the letter. 

" Well, sir, what have you got to show ? " asked 
Francie s father, leaning far back on the sofa and 
moving nothing but his head, and that very little, 
toward his interlocutor. Probert was placed side- 
wise, a hand on each knee, almost facing him, 
on the edge of the seat. 







" To show, sir what do you mean ? " 

" What do you do for a living ? How do you 
subsist ? " 

" Oh, comfortably enough. Of course it would 
be criminal in you not to satisfy yourself on that 
point. My income is derived from three sources. 
First, some property left me by my dear mother. 
Second, a legacy from my poor brother, who had 
inherited a small fortune from an old relation of 
ours who took a great fancy to him (he went to 
America to see her), and which he divided among 
the four of us in the will he made at the time of 
the war." 

" The war what war ? " asked Mr. Dosson. 

" Why the Franco-German " 

" Oh, that old war ! " And Mr. Dosson almost 
laughed. " Well ? " he softly continued. 

" Then my father is so good as to make me a 
little allowance ; and some day I shall have more 
from him." 

Mr. Dosson was silent a moment ; then he 
observed, " Why, you seem to have fixed it so you 
live mostly on other folks." 

" I shall never attempt to live on you, sir ! " 
This was spoken with some vivacity by our young 
man ; he felt the next moment that he had said 
something that might provoke a retort. But his 
companion only rejoined, mildly, impersonally : 

"Well, I guess there won 't be any trouble about 
that. And what does my daughter say ? " 





" I haven 't spoken to her yet." 

" Haven 't spoken to her ? " 

"I thought it more orthodox to break ground 
with you first." 

" Well, when I was after Mrs. Dosson I guess I 
spoke to her quick enough," Francie s father said, 
humorously. There was an element of reproach 
in this and Gaston Probert was mystified, for the 
inquiry about his means a moment before had 
been in the nature of a challenge. " How will you
