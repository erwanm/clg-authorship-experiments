Miss Evers for herself, the young lady might certainly 
have discovered the intrinsic value of so disinterested 
a suitor. Her mother had the credit of having made 
the match. Gordon was known to be looking for a 
wife ; Mrs. Evers had put her little feather-head of 
a daughter very much forward, and Gordon was as 
easily captivated as a child by the sound of a rattle. 





Blanche had an affection for him now, however ; Ber- 
nard saw no reason to doubt that, and certainly she 
would have been a very flimsy creature indeed if she 
had not been touched by liis inexhaustible kindness. 
She had every conceivable indulgence, and if she 
married him for his money, at least she had got what 
she wanted. She led the most agreeable life conceiv- 
able, and she ought to be in high good-humor. It 
was impossible to have a prettier house, a prettier 
carriage, more jewels and laces for the adornment of 
a plump little person. It was impossible to go to 
more parties, to give better dinners, to have fewer 
privations or annoyances. Bernard was so much 
struck with all this that, advancing rapidly in the 
intimacy of his gracious hostess, he ventured to call 
her attention to her blessings. She answered that 
she was perfectly aware of them, and there was no 
pretty speech she was not prepared to make about 
Gordon. 

" I know what yon want to say," she went on ; 
" you want to say that he spoils me, and I don't see 
why you should hesitate. You generally say every- 
thing you want, and you needn 't be afraid of me. 
He doesn 't spoil me, simply because I am so .bad 
I can't be spoiled ; but that 's of no consequence. I 
was spoiled ages ago ; every one spoiled me — every 
one except Mrs. Vivian. I was always fond of having 
everything I want, and I generally managed to get it, 





I always had lovely clothes; mamma thought that 
was a kind of a duty. If it was a duty, I don't sup- 
pose it counts as a part of the spoiling. But I was 
very much indulged, and I know I have everything 
now. Gordon is a perfect husband ; I believe if I 
were to ask him for a present of his nose, he would 
cut it off and give it to me. I think I will ask him 
for a small piece of it some day ; it will rather im- 
prove him to have an inch or two less. I don't say 
he 's handsome ; but he 's just as good as he can be. 
Some people say that if you are very fond of a person 
you always think them handsome ; but I don't agree 
with that at all. I am very fond of Gordon, and yet 
I am not blinded by affection, as regards his personal 
appearance. He 's too light for my taste, and too red. 
And because you think people handsome, it doesn 't 
follow that you are fond of them. I used to have a 
friend who was awfully handsome — the handsomest 
man I ever saw — and I was perfectly conscious of 
his defects. But I 'm not conscious of Gordon's, and 
I don't believe he has got any. He 's so intensely 
kind ; it 's quite pathetic. One would think he had 
done me an injury in marrying me, and that he 
wanted to make up for it. If he has done me an 
injury I haven 't discovered it yet, and I don't believe 
I ever shall. I certainly shall not as long as he lets 
me order all the clothes I want. I have ordered five 
dresses this week, and I mean to order two more. 





When I told Gordon, what do you think he did ? He 
simply kissed me. Well, if that 's not expressive, I 
don't know what he could have done. He kisses me 
about seventeen times a day. I suppose it's very 
improper for a woman to tell any one how often her 
husband kisses Jier ; but, as you happen to have seen 
him do it, I don't suppose you will be scandalized. 
I know you are not easily scandalized; I am not 
afraid of you. You are scandalized at my getting so 
many dresses ? Well, I told you I was spoiled — I 
freely acknowledge it. That 's why I was afraid to 
tell Gordon — because when I was married I had such 
a lot of things ; I was supposed to have dresses enough 
to last for a year. But Gordon hadn 't to pay for them, 
so there was no harm in my letting him feel that he 
has a wife. If he thinks I am extravagant, he can 
easily stop kissing me. You don't think it would be 
easy to stop ? It 's very well, then, for those that have 
never begun ! " 

Bernard had a good deal of conversation with
