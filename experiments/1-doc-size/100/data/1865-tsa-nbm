he said, in his thought. " The woman is losing her 
senses." 

In the evening, Guy endeavored to approach his wife 
with remonstrance on the money question, but she 



 

pushed him aside with a cold dignity that chafed him 
into passion. 

" Madam ! " he exclaimed, " I will not have my 
goods wasted my hard accumulations scattered to the 
wind ! " 

Lydia made no response ; not even so much as lift 
ing her eyes from the book she was reading. 

" Where are the fifty dollars I placed in your hands, 
day hefore yesterday ? " 

No answer no sign. 

Lydia ! " 

Mrs. Guy looked up. 

" Did you hear my question ? " 

She bowed, indifferently. 

" Then why don't you speak ? " 

" You have got to learn another way with me, 
Adam." Lydia's strangely altered eyes dwelt on her 
husband's face with so fixed a stare, that he felt the low 
shudder which had once before crept along his nerves. 

"I shall, in all probability, take another way," he 
answered, a threat half revealing itself in his tones. 
" As just said, I will not have my hard accumulations 
scattered to the wind. Justice to myself and children 
demand restriction. It seems that you are bent on car 
rying things with a high hand. Nearly a hundred dol 
lars spent in three days, and not a word of explanation. 
No wonder even your children say, that you waste and 
scatter faster than ten men can earn." 

Mrs. Guy started as if stung by a serpent, a sudden 
paleness overspreading her face. 

" My children, Adam ? " she said, huskily, and in a 
voice painful with surprise. 



 

" Yes, your children," returned her husband, with 
an air of cruel triumph. 

"Who said it? What child? When?" There 
was a trembling earnestness about Mrs. Guy, now. 

" I heard it with my own ears ; that is sufficient. 
And when things come to the pass that a woman's 
children remark upon her wasteful use of money, it is 
about time for the husband to interfere and save him 
self from ruin as I shall do." 

This was too hard a blow for Mrs. Guy. She arose, 
without answering, and left the room. In a few min 
utes she returned, and handing her husband a small 
pocket-book, said, in a mild, yet firm voice 

" You will find twenty dollars in that pocket-book, 
Adam, the remainder of what you gave me day before 
yesterday. The due bills were in settlement of stand 
ing accounts. In the future, you must do all the buy 
ing. I shall waste no more of your hard accumulations. 
What you bring into the house, I will dispense ; but 
not a dollar shall again pass through my fingers. There 
is such a thing as going too far ; and you have stepped 
over the line." 

" Don't play the fool, Lydia," said Guy, impatiently, 
tossing back the pocket-book, which fell upon the floor. 
" I've had enough of your silly airs. You're trifling 
with the wrong man." 

" There's no trifling, Adam, as you will find." Ly 
dia was calm, but resolute of manner. " When my 
children are brought up as false witnesses against me, 
it is time that I withdraw from a position that has never 
been satisfactorily administered and I do now with 
draw."
