" My indictment of the Queensland-Kanaka Labor Traffic is this : 



"1. It generally demoralizes and always impoverishes the Kanaka, de- 
prives him of his citizenship, and depopulates the islands fitted to his home. 

"2. It is felt to lower the dignity of the white agricultural laborer in 
Queensland, and beyond a doubt it lowers his wages there. 

" 3. The whole system is fraught with danger to Australia and the islands 
on the score of health. 

"4. On social and political grounds the continuance of the Queensland 
Kanaka Labor Traffic must be a barrier to the true federation of the Aus- 
tralian colonies. 

"5. The Regulations under which the Traffic exists in Queensland are 
inadequate to prevent abuses, and in the nature of things they must re- 
main so. 

" 6. The whole system is contrary to the spirit and doctrine of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. The Gospel requires us to help the weak, but the Kanaka is 
fleeced and trodden down. 

"7. The bed-rock of this Traffic is that the life and liberty of a black 
man are of less value than those of a white man. And a Traffic that has 
grown out of ' slave-hunting ' will certainly remain to the end not unlike its 
origin." 




Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it.

FROM Diary : — For a day or two we have been plow- 
ing among an invisible vast wilderness of islands, 
catching now and then a shadowy glimpse of a mem- 
ber of it. There does seem to be a prodigious lot of islands 
this year ; the map of this region is freckled and fly -specked 
all over with them. Their number would seem to be un- 
countable. We are moving among the Fijis now — 224 islands 
and islets in the group. In front of us, to the west, the wilder- 
ness stretches toward Australia, then curves upward to Kew 
Guinea, and still up and up to Japan ; behind us, to the east, 
the wilderness stretches sixty degrees across the wastes of the 
Pacific; south of us is New Zealand. Somewhere or other 
among these myriads Samoa is concealed, and not discoverable 
on the map. Still, if you wish to go there, you will have no 
trouble about finding it if you follow the directions given by 
Robert Louis Stevenson to Dr. Conan Doyle and to Mr. J. M. 
Barrie. " You go to America, cross the continent to San 
Francisco, and then it's the second turning to the left." To 
get the full flavor of the joke one must take a glance at 
the map. 

Wednesday, September 11. — Yesterday we passed close to 
an island or so, and recognized the published Fiji character- 
istics: a broad belt of clean white coral sand around the 
island; back of it a graceful fringe of leaning palms, with 
native huts nestling cosily among the shrubbery at their 



bases ; back of these a stretch of level land clothed in tropic 
vegetation; back of that, rugged and picturesque mountains. 
A detail of the immediate foreground : a mouldering ship 
perched high up on a reef -bench. This completes the com- 
position, and makes the picture artistically perfect. 

In the afternoon we sighted Suva, the capital of the group, 
and threaded our way into the secluded little harbor — a placid 
basin of brilliant blue and green water tucked snugly in 
among the sheltering hills, A few ships rode at anchor in 
it — one of them a sailing vessel flying the American flag; 




and they said she came from Duluth! There's a journey! 
Duluth is several thousand miles from the sea, and yet she 
is entitled to the proud name of Mistress of the Commercial 
Marine of the United States of America. There is only one 
free, independent, unsubsidized American ship sailing the for- 
eign seas, and Duluth owns it. All by itself that ship is 
the American fleet. All by itself it causes the American name 
and power to be respected in the far regions of the globe. All 
by itself it certifies to the world that the most populous civil- 
ized nation in the earth has a just pride in her stupendous 
stretch of sea-front, and is determined to assert and maintain 
her rightful place as one of the Great Maritime Powers of the 
Planet. All by itself it is making foreign eyes familiar with a 
Flag which they have not seen before for forty years, outside 
of the museum. For what Duluth has done, in building, 
equipping, and maintaining at her sole expense the American 
Foreign Commercial Fleet, and in thus rescuing the American 
name from shame and lifting it high for the homage of the
