while, with two fingers softly playing upon her 
lower lip, she sat estimating the possibility she 
had named "I don't mind telling you frankly 
that I asked Mrs. Beever if you were still in love 
with him." 

She clasped her hands so eagerly that she almost 
clapped them. " Then you do care ? " 





He was looking beyond her now at something 
at the other end of the garden ; and he made no 
other reply than to say: "She didn't give you 
away." 

" It was very good of her ; but I would tell you 
myself, you know, perfectly, if I were." 

" You didn't tell me perfectly four years ago," 
Dennis returned. 

Rose hesitated a minute; but this didn't pre 
vent her speaking with an effect of great prompti 
tude. " Oh, four years ago I was the biggest fool 
in England ! " 

Dennis, at this, met her eyes again. "Then

" Can you ask after what I've done ? " 

" Well, then ; Tie no longer cares ? "

" Upon my honour." 

" But you had an idea ? " Dennis bravely 

pursued. 

Rose as dauntlessly met him. " I had an idea." 

" And you've had to give it up ? " 

" I've had to give it up." 

Dennis was silent ; he slowly got upon his feet. 

" Well that does something." 

"For your revenge?" She sounded a bitter 
laugh. " I should think it might ! What it does 
is magnificent ! " 

He stood looking over her head till at last he 
exclaimed: "So, apparently, is the child !" 

" She has come ? " Rose sprang up to find that 
Effie had been borne toward them, across the 
grass, in the arms of the muscular Manning, who,
