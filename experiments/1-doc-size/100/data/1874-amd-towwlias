Outside he transplanted his heads of lettuce, sowed fresh seeds
of various kinds, and began to set slips of geranium. On cold or
stormy days they kept the glass covered, and always at night. It was
marvellous, the way every thing throve and grew. It seemed to Hal that
there was nothing else in the world so interesting.

Kit had begun to take lessons on his violin; but he soon found there
was a wide difference between the absolute drudgery of rudiments,
and the delicious dreams of melody that floated through his brain.
Sometimes he cried over the difficulties, and felt tempted to throw
away his violin; then he and Hal would have a good time with their
beloved Charles Auchester, when he would go on with renewed courage.

After Easter the flowers looked like mere wrecks. Hal cut most of the
roses down, trimmed the heliotrope and fuchsias, and planted verbenas.
His pansies, which had come from seed, looked very fine and thrifty,
and were in bud. So he mentioned that he would have quite a number of
bedding-plants for sale.

Indeed, the fame of Hal's green-house spread through Madison. It was a
marvel to everybody, how he could make plants grow in such a remarkable
fashion, and under not a few disadvantages. But he studied the soil
and habits minutely; and then he had a "gift,"--as much of a genius for
this, as Kit's for music, or Charlie's for drawing.

But with these warm spring days Hal grew very pale and thin. It
seemed to him sometimes as if he could not endure the peculiar wear
and anxiety of the school. There were thirty-five scholars now; and,
although he tried to keep respectable order, he found it very hard
work. He had such a tender, indulgent heart, that he oftener excused
than punished.

His head used to ache dreadfully in the afternoon, and every pulse in
his body would throb until it seemed to make him absolutely sore. The
gardening and the school were quite too much.

"Granny," said Charlie one evening, "I am not going to school any more."

Granny opened her eyes in surprise.

"I am going to work."

"To work?"

It was astonishing to hear Charlie declare such sentiments.

"Yes,--in the mill."

"What will you do?"

"Sarah Marshall began last fall: it's cleaning specks and imperfections
out of the cloth; not very hard, either, and they give her four and a
half a week."

"That's pretty good," said Granny.

"Yes. I shall have to do something. I hate housework and sewing, and--I
want some money."

"I'm sure Hal's as good as an angel."

"I don't want Hal's. Goodness knows! he has enough to do, and it's high
time I began to think about myself."

Granny was overwhelmed with admiration at Charlie's spirit and
resolution, yet she was not quite certain of its being proper until she
had asked Hal.

"I wish she wanted to learn dressmaking instead, or to teach school;
but she isn't proud, like Flossy. And now she is growing so large that
she wants nice clothes, and all that."

Yet Hal sighed a little. Charlie somehow appeared to be lacking in
refinement. She had a great deal of energy and persistence, and was not
easily daunted or laughed out of any idea.

"Though I think she will make a nice girl," said Hal, as if he had been
indulging in a little treason. "We have a good deal to be thankful for,
Granny."

"Yes, indeed! And dear, brave Joe such a nice boy!"

Hal made a few inquiries at the mill. They would take Charlie, and pay
her two dollars a week for the first month, after that by the piece;
and, if she was smart, she could earn three or four dollars.

So Charlie went to work with her usual sturdiness. If they could have
looked in her heart, and beheld all her plans, and known that she
hated this as bitterly as washing dishes or mending old clothes!

On the first of June, Hal took an account of stock. They had been quite
fortunate in the sale of early vegetables. The lettuce, radishes, and
tomato-plants had done beautifully. For cut-flowers he had received
fifty-two dollars; for bedding-plants,--scarlet and other geraniums,
and pansies,--the sum had amounted to over nine dollars; for vegetables
and garden-plants, eleven. They had not incurred any extra expense,
save the labor.

"To think of that, Granny! Almost seventy-five dollars! And on such a
small scale too! I think I could make gardening pay, if I had a fair
