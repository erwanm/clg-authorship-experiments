you if you had said, 'How charming!' or 'How frantically interesting ! ' " 

"Well, it's the last if not the first. Aileen will say 
that and mean it. I'll telephone to the bookstore the 
first thing Monday morning and get a copy. Now I must 
go. It's late."

"Let me telephone for a taxi." 

Alexina laughed merrily. "You'll never believe it, 
but I've just thirty cents in my purse. I forgot to ask 
Morty for something before he left. . . . You see, I 
happened to find quite a bit in mother's desk and so 
I've never thought to ask him for an allowance. But 
I shall at once." 

' ' An allowance ? But you have your own money ? Or 
is it because the estate isn't settled? What has Morty 
to do with that?" 

"I believe we get the income from the estate until it 
is settled. But I gave my power of attorney to Morty. ' ' 

"Oh! But if there is money on deposit in the bank 
you can draw on it." 



 

' ' Could I ? Well ! I'll just draw a round hundred on 
Monday at ten a. m." 

"Why did you give your power of attorney to 
Morty?" 

"Oh . . . why ... he asked me to ... I know 
nothing about business, and he naturally would attend 
to my affairs." 

"But you are not going away. No one needs your 
power of attorney. And the executors are Judge Lawton and Mr. Abbott. You are here to sign such papers 
as they advise. . . . Don't be angry, please. I am not 
insinuating anything agaiast Morty. He's never had a 
dishonest thought in his life . . . has always been the 
squarest . . . but ..." 

"Well?" 

Alexina 's head was very high. It was quite bad enough 
for Tom Abbott and Judge Lawton . . . but for his 
sister . . . 

"It's this way, Alexina. People in this world, more 
particularly men, are just about as honest as circumstances will permit them to be. Some are stronger than 
Life in one way or another, no doubt of it; but they 
make up for it by being weaker in others. ... I am 
talking particularly of the money question, the struggle 
for existence, which the vast majority of men are forced 
to make. . . . 

' ' Men fight Life from the hour they leave their homes, 
when they have any, to force success — in one way or 
another — out of her until the hour they are able to lay 
down the burden. . . . Some are too strong and too firm 
in their ideals ever to do wrong ; they would prefer failure, and generally they are strong enough to avoid it, 
even to succeed in their way against the most overwhelming odds. . . . Many are too clever not to find some way 
of compromising and circumventing. . . . Others just 
peg along and barely make both ends meet. . . . Others 
go under and down and out. 

"Morty, like millions of other young Americans, had 
good principles and high ideals inculcated from his 
earliest boyhood and took to them as a duck takes to 
water. Nor is he weak. But although he is a hard and 



 

steady worker he is also visionary. He speculated on 
the stock market before he was married. Probably not 
now as the market is moribund. He is frantic to get 
rich ... for more reasons than one." 

"But he never would do anything dishonorable." 

''No. Nothing he couldn't square with his conscience 
if it turned out all right. But the most honest man, 
when in a hole, finds little difficulty in arriving at the 
conclusion that what is, illogieally, the possession of the 
women of his family, is his if he needs it. 

"Moreover, no doubt you have discovered that Morty 
is the sort of man who looks upon women as man's natural inferiors, that if there is any question of sacrifice 
the woman is not to be considered for a moment . . . 
especially where no public risk is involved. That sort 
of man only thinks he is too honest to refrain from
