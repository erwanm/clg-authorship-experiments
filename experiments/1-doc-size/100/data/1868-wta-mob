Leo conducted his team to Pemberton Square, and knocked at the back
door of the rich man's house. One of the kitchen girls answered the
summons, and great was her surprise when she saw the palace of the
mice. It was taken into the kitchen, and Mrs. Checkynshaw was called.
She came down, accompanied by Miss Elinora. Leo explained that the
banker had purchased the establishment, and that he had been directed
to deliver it.

Elinora, though she had sat up late the night before at the party, and
had been very ill-natured all day, was surprised into a smile of
pleasure when she saw the cunning little creatures in their curious
house. Leo gave them some canary seed, of which he carried a supply in
his pocket, in order to induce the pets to exhibit themselves when
desired. They had behaved very well thus far, and had produced a
favorable impression upon all who had seen them.

Elinora was pleased with the mice because they promised to afford her a
new sensation.

"I think I'll have them in my chamber, mother, where I can see them,"
said she, after she had looked at them a while.

"I wouldn't have them in my chamber, miss," replied Leo.

"Why, not?"

"They sleep in the daytime, and train in the night. They would rattle
about the house so that you could not sleep."

"I will have them in my dressing-room, then," added she.

"That's not exactly the place for them," continued Leo, who had not a
very clear idea of what the dressing-room was.

"Where would you keep them, then?" asked Elinora, petulantly.

"In the kitchen, or the back room."

"What, keep such a pretty cage as that in the kitchen?" exclaimed the
rich man's daughter.

"You can see it just as well in the kitchen as in the parlor, and it is
just as handsome in one place as another, miss. White mice are pretty
little creatures, miss; but, like rabbits, squirrels, and other
animals, they have an odor of their own which isn't pleasant,
especially when they are shut up in a warm room," Leo explained, with a
smile to soften the disparaging remark, for he didn't like to say
anything against the pets.

"I don't want them, then," said Elinora, turning up her delicate nose.

"They won't trouble you if you have them well cared for, and keep them
in a proper place. A horse is a very fine animal; but you would not
find him agreeable in the parlor," added Leo. "There's a nice place for
them;" and he pointed to the washroom, through which he had entered the
kitchen. "You can come down and see them when you wish, and they won't
trouble any one out there."

Mrs. Checkynshaw decided to have the house put up in the wash-room, as
Leo suggested, and the young mechanic volunteered to do the work. He
had brought with him a couple of wooden brackets and some screws, and,
with the assistance of Tom Casey, he put them up, and placed the palace
upon them. Mrs. Checkynshaw and her daughter watched the operation with
interest, and asked a great many questions about the mice and their
habits. Leo talked and worked, and by the time he had finished the job,
he had explained all he knew of the little animals. He told the kitchen
girl, who was to take care of them, how to feed them, and how to clean
out the cage, admonishing her to do the latter every day.

The lady of the house was so well pleased with the zeal and pains
displayed by the young mechanic, that she gave him half a dollar for
the extra labor he had performed; and Leo and Tom left the house.

"It's a good job you've done the day," said Tom, as they walked down
the square.

"I've done first rate, Tom. I've sold my work for a fair price, and got
two more jobs. I'm lucky, and I'm very grateful, too, for my good
fortune. Tom, I'll give you the half dollar the lady handed to me for
your share of the work."

"Go way wid you! I won't take it!" protested the Irish boy.

"Yes, you must, Tom. You have helped me. I don't know how I should have
got along without you."

"Niver you mind that. Your ould man is sick, and it's great need you'll
have of all the money you can lay your hands on."

"But I have made six dollars besides this, and I'm not going to pocket
all the plunder. Take this, and buy some book you need."

Tom was finally prevailed upon to accept the half dollar, though he did
so under protest. Leo was happy--never so happy before in his life.
Success had crowned his darling scheme, and he entered the house with a
radiant smile upon his face. But, in the midst of his exultant joy, he
did not forget that his father, for whose sake he had been stimulated
to make this mighty effort, was very sick. As softly as a cat he opened
