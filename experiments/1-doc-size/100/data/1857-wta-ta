" That is the fashion ; you must talk right up ta 
them. It' they swear at you, swear at them back 
again — that is, at the clerks and salesmen, ll tuey 
give you any ' lip,' let 'em have as good as they 
send." 

" I don't want to do that." 

" Must do it, Harry. ' Live and learn ' is my 
motto. "When you go among the Romans, do as tne 
Romans do." 

Harry did not like this advice ; for he who, among 
the Romans, would do as the Romans do, among 
hog.* would do as the hogv io. 

" If I only suit them, I don't care." 

" You do , I heard Wake tell Wade that you wer« 
a tirst rate boy.'" 

" Did you ? " And Harry's heart swelled with 
joy to think that, in spite of his trials, he had actually 
triumphed in the midst of them. 

So he dropped the subject, with the resolution to 
redouble his exertions to please his employers the 
next day, and turned his thoughts to Julia Bryant, to 
wonder if she won still living, or bad become an 
tngel *p<ta«d. 





CHAPTER XVII. 

rs WHICH HAEBY BEVISITS BOCKVILLE, AND 
MEETS WITH A SEBIOUS LOSS. 

The next evening, Harry was conscious of having 
gained a little in the ability to discharge his nove* 
duties. Either the partners and the clerks had be- 
come tired of swearing and laughing at him, or he 
had made a decided improvement ; for less fault was 
found with him, and his position was much more sat- 
isfactory. With a light heart he put up the shutters ; 
for though he was very much fatigued, the prestige 
of future success was so cheering, that he scarcely 
heeded his weary, aching limbs. 

Every day was an improvement on the preceding 
day , and before the week was out, Harry fcund him- 
eelf quite at home in his new occupation. He was 
never a moment behind the time at which he was re- 
quired to be at the store in tte morning. This 




promptness was specially noted by the partners; for  
when they came to their business in the morning; 
they found the store well warmed, the floor nicely 
swept, and every thing put in order. 

When he was sent out with bundles, he did not 
stop to look at the pictures in the shop windows, to 
play marbles, or tell long stories to other boys in the 
streets. If his employers had even been very unrea- 
sonable, they could not have helped being pleased 
with the new boy, and Wake confidentially assured 
Wade that they had got a treasure. 

Our hero was wholly devoted to his business. He 
intended to make a man of himself, and he could 
anly accomplish his purpose by constant exertion, by 
constant study, and constant " trying again." He 
was obliged to keep a close watch over himself, fot 
often ne was tempted to be idle and negligent, to be 
careless and indifferent. 

After supper, on Thursday evening of his second 
week at Wake and Wade's, he hastened to Majoi 
Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the 
cews from Rockville. His heart beat violently when 
be saw John's great wagon, forhedreaded some fear- 





ful announcement from his sick friend. He had nn t 
before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness 
to the little angel, as now, when she lay upon the 
bed of pain, perhaps of death. She had kindled in 
his soul a love for the good and the beautiful. She 
had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference 
between tne right and the wrong. In a word, she 
was the guiding star of his existence. Her approba- 
tion was to be the bright guerdon of fidelity to truth
