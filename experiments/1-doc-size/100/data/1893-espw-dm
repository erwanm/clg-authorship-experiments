And, indeed, that night, at half-past 
eleven, Trouncey tumbled into Donald 's 
room, and flinging himself into Fleet 's empty 
revolving study-chair (Jamie had gone to 
bed), put his feet on the table, wheeled 
around slowly, and heavily said : 

" It 's all up, Marey. I'm expelled from 
Harle College." 

" What for ? " asked Don sharply, wheel 
ing too. 

" Oh, for the graveyard business." 

" Nothing else ? " 

" They didn't mention anything else. 
That was the point. Buried alive ; brutal 
ity, and that sort of thing." 

"Did you deny it?" 

" Oh, yes, yes. I said I never hit foul. 
I said I wasn't there. Middleton said I 
was. Prexy advised me to own up. Said 
it would be better for me. I said I'd be 
blanked first, for I wasn't there. So I was 
expelled. That 's all." 

" Anything said about me ? " asked Don 
ald thoughtfully ; his handsome face, refined 
by the suffering of the last few weeks, 
showed sensitive agitation while Trouncey 
spoke. 

" Not a word. Didn't seem to spot you. 



 

Impression out that you were cramming for 
Peeker Prizes that night. Friends of yours 
circulated it. I'm glad of it," added Trouncey 
generously. " I don't want you floored." 

There was a silence between the two boys, 
which neither seemed inclined to break. 
Don did not even offer Trouncey a cigar, 
the occasion seemed above smoking, some 
how. Donald looked haggardly at Troun- 
cey 's big, good-natured, lumbering face. Its 
distress was the more striking because he 
could not remember ever to have seen 
Trouncey look sad before. 

" My father," added the prize-fighter 's 
son stoutly, " will knock me down. I ex 
pect he 'll kill me, he 'll be so mad. He 
thought I'd make a scholar, turn out a're 
spectable fellow, and that sort of thing ; he 
said he didn't want a son of his in the ring. 
He promised my mother he'd make a su 
perior citizen of me, he did really. She 
died five years ago. My father liked my 
mother. She was a good woman. Hard 
hit to father that I'm such a dunce, any 
how. T is, really. He thought I'd win for 
a purse of a thousand on rank, and that. I 
can't, you know, Marcy. T isn't in me. I 
expect to come out as I sailed in, last 
division, and a good way down, too. But I 
never thought I'd be expelled from Harle," 
said Trouncey, with a broken voice. " My 
mother would have been disappointed, 
wouldn't she ? Well, I can stand the lick 
ing, I guess. He can pommel me, if he 
wants to. But I'm sort o glad she ain't 
around." 

" Trouncey," said Donald, in a firm voice, 
"you just wait here a few minutes, will 
you ? I've got a little errand to attend to. 
I 'll be back directly, and we 'll get up some 
thing hot, and talk it over. I 'll run over 
and get a few lemons ; and I believe I'm 
out of sugar." 

Donald Marcy did not go for lemons and 
sugar ; at least not just then. On the con 
trary, he went to the President 's house ; he 
went as straight as he could go ; he ran all 
the way, and came panting up to the door 
of the official mansion, a very short-winded 
and heavy-hearted young man. 

Yet there was a curious, delicate lightness 
in his soul, too, as if rudiments of wings 
were there, ready to fly, if they had a
