dered about it. He no longer wondered, he knew. Could 
a man be brave enough to protest to a pit-boss when his 
body was numb with weariness? Could he think out a 
definite conclusion as to his rights and wrongs, and back 



 

his conclusion with effective action, when his mental facul- 
ties were paralysed by such weariness of body ? 

Hal had come here, as one goes upon the deck of a ship 
in mid-ocean, to see the storm. In this ocean of social 
misery, of ignorance and despair, one saw upturned, tor- 
tured faces, writhing limbs and clutching hands ; in one's 
ears was a storm of lamentation, upon one's cheek a spray 
of blood and tears. Hal found himself so deep in this 
ocean that he could no longer find consolation in the 
thought that he could escape whenever he wanted to : that 
he could say to himself, It is sad, it is terrible — but thank 
God, I can get out of it when I choose! I can go back 
into the warm and well-lighted saloon and tell the other 
passengers how picturesque it is, what an interesting ex- 
perience they are missing ! 



 During these days of torment, Hal did not go 
to see " Red Mary " ; but then, one evening, the Minettis' 
baby having been sick, she came in to ask about it, bring- 
ing what she called " a bit of a custard " in a bowl. Hal 
was suspicious enough of the ways of men, especially of 
business-men ; but when it came to women he was without 
insight — it did not occur to him as singular that an Irish 
girl with many troubles at home should come out to nurse 
a Dago woman's baby. He did not reflect that there were 
plenty of sick Irish babies in the camp, to whom Mary 
might have taken her " bit of a custard." And when he 
saw the surprise of Rosa, who had never met Mary before, 
he took it to be the touching gratitude of the poor ! 

There are, in truth, many kinds of women, with many 
arts, and no man has time to learn them all. Hal had ob- 
served the shop-girl type, who dress themselves with many 
frills, and cast side-long glances, and indulge in fits of 
giggles to attract the attention of the male ; he was familiar 
with the society-girl type, who achieve the same end with 



 

« 

more subtle and alluring means. But could there be a 
type who hold little Dago babies in their laps, and call 
them pretty Irish names, and feed them custard out of a 
spoon ? Hal had never heard of that kind, and he thought 
that "Red Mary" made a charming picture — a Celtic 
madonna with a Sicilian infant in her arms. 

He noticed that she was wearing the same faded blue 
calico-dress with a patch on the shoulder. Man though he 
was, he realised that dress is an important consideration 
in the lives of women. He was tempted to suspect that 
this blue calico might be the only dress that Mary owned ; 
but seeing it newly laundered every time, he concluded 
that she must have at least one other. At any rate, here 
she was, crisp and fresh-looking ; and with the new shining 
costume, she had put on the long promised "company 
manner": high spirits and badinage, precisely like any 
belle of the world of luxury, who powders and bedecks 
herself for a ball. She had been grim and complaining in 
former meetings with this interesting young man ; she had 
frightened him away, apparently; perhaps she could win 
him back by womanliness and good humour. 

She rallied him upon his battered scalp and his creaking 
back, telling him he looked ten years older — which he was 
fully prepared to believe. Also she had fun with him for 
working under a Slovak — another loss of caste, it ap- 
peared ! This was a joke the Minettis could share in — 
especially Little Jerry, who liked jokes. He told Mary 
how^ Joe Smith had had to pay fifteen dollars for his new 
job, besides several drinks at O'Callahan's. Also he told 
how Mike Sikoria had called Joe his " green mule." Lit- 
tle Jerry complained about the turn of events, for in the 
old days Joe had taught him a lot of fine new games — 
and now he was sore, and would not play them. Also, in 
the old days he had sung a lot of jolly songs, full of the 
most fascinating rhymes. There was a song about a 
" monkey puzzle tree " ! Had Mary ever seen that kind of 



 

tree? Little Jerry never got tired of trying to imagine 
what it might look like.
