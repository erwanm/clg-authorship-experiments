found some one he knew, and Mr. Whitney had 
gone to talk to General Morris. A tall young 
lady came over and began complimenting Miss 
Whitney on her story in Godey's, and Delia flushed 
up with pleasure. Then she begged to introduce 
her to a friend. She wrote verses only, and her 
friend had composed music for them. 

Hanny kept watching her hostess. She knew 
some of the guests, from having had them pointed 
out to her in the street. There was Mr. Greeley, 
thin of face and careless of attire in those early 
days. In the street he could always be told by a 
shaggy light coat that he wore. 



A very sweet-looking elderly lady came up 
presently and spoke to Delia, who was in full flow 
of eager talk with the young musical composer. 

" Isn't that your sister, or your niece, the one 
who sang here some time ago? I saw her come 
in with Mr. Whitney." 

" Oh, no," returned Delia. " But she is a very 
dear friend, Mr. Underbill's sister." 

"Mr. Stephen Underbill ?" 

" Yes, she is his sister; but it is Mr. Ben Under- 
bill who is here." 

" I know Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Underbill very 
well. She was a Beekman. And Dr. Hoffman's 
wife belongs to the family." 

Delia turned and introduced Mrs. Kirtland. 

She had such an attractive face, framed in with 
rows of snowy puffs, quite gone out of date, but 
becoming to her nevertheless.

" I feel that I almost know you," she said sweetly, 
"though I half mistook you for Miss Whitney ; but 
she is dark, and you are fair, so I ought not to have 
made the blunder. I know your brother Stephen 
and his wife." 

" Oh ! ' Hanny gave it a glad little sound, and 
smiled, as she put out her small hand. 

Mrs. Kirtland took the unoccupied seat. 

" I suppose you have hardly begun life, you 
look so young. But no doubt you are a genius of 
some sort. Mrs. Osgood is so extraordinarily good 
to young geniuses." 

" No, I haven't any genius," and Hanny flushed, 
as she gave a beguiling smile that lighted up her 

 

face. " And though there are a good many of us, 
we have not even a family genius." 

" That depends upon whether you restrict 
the word to painting a picture or writing a 
poem or a story. Mr. Stephen Underhill is 
very highly spoken of as one of the promising 
young business-men. And is it your brother 
who was in the office of old Dr. Fitch, and in 
the hospital?" 

" Yes, ma'am," returned Hanny, with a glow of 
pleasure. Young people were still expected to say 
"Yes, sir," and "Yes, ma'am," to their elders, out 
of respect. 

"That does very well for one family, though the 
Whitneys seem to have a good share. Miss Delia 
is quite a success, I hear. And we always find Mr. 
Whitney very entertaining. Have you known them 
long?" 

" Oh, for years, seven almost. And we used to 
be neighbours." 

"A friendship is said to be certain when you 
have held it seven years. Have you met Mrs. 
Osgood before? ' 

" No, ma 'am ; but I saw her quite a long while 
ago at Fordham." 

" At Fordham ! Then you must have known 
the poet Edgar Allan Poe."
