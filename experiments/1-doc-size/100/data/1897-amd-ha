The little girl had so many things to distract 
her attention that she wondered how grown-up 
people could be so tranquil with all their knowl- 
edges and their cares. She began to realise the 
great difference in tastes and characteristics, 
though she would not have quite comprehended 
that long word. Perhaps Ben, being in the midst 
of stories and books, and hearing so much talk 
about the great men of the day, roused the same 
train of thought in her, though I think hero-wor- 
ship came natural to her. The Dean girls read 
the sweet pretty domestic stories with great relish. 
Miss Macintosh, Mary Howitt, and even Jane 



Austin were their delight. Hanny and Daisy 
were deeply interested in history. And during 
the last year some very spirited stories had been 
written on the Mexican war, and all the struggles 
of a few years before. The wealth and splendour 
of Montezuma and his sad ending, the wonders of 
that land of ancient romance, were rendered 
more real on account of the present struggle that 
Hanny and her father had followed closely. She 
kept in touch with all the generals. The hero of 
Monterey, General Worth, General Scott's entry 
into the city of Montezuma, General Watts 
Kearny, who led his men a thousand miles 
through the desert to seize Santa Fe, and hold 
New Mexico, and his brilliant young nephew, 
Philip, who was the first man to enter the gate 
of San Antonio, and who lost his left arm at the 
battle of Churubusco. Little did she dream, 
indeed, who could have dreamed then, that he was 
to be one of the heroes of another war, nearer and 
more dreadful to us! 

Then there was a great celebration over the 
final victory. City Hall was crowded. There 
were some magnificent fireworks and much rejoic- 
ing. And though there were questions for diplo- 
macy to adjust, we had gained California and New 
Mexico; and both were destined to have a great 
bearing on the future of the country. 

When Hanny could spare time from this excit 
ing topic and her lessons, there was little Stevie, 
who was the sweetest and most cunning baby 
alive, she was quite sure. He could run all over, 

 

and say ever so many words. The hard ones he 
had to shorten, so he called the little girl Nan, 
and Dolly and Stephen caught it up as well. 
When they came over to First Street, the neigh- 
bourhood paid him the highest honours. All the 
children wanted to see him, and walk up and 
down with him. He was so merry, laughing at 
the least little thing, and chattering away in his 
baby language, with a few words now and then in 
good English. And, oh, delight! his hair curled 
all over his head, and had a golden gleam to it. 
Certainly, as a baby, he was a tremendous success. 

But the crowning point of this May was 
Hanny's birthday party. She was twelve years 
old. Dolly and Margaret came clown to spend 
the day and help. Oddly enough, Hanny knew 
very few boys. First, she thought she would only 
have a girls' party. But there was Charlie, and 
some of her schoolmates had brothers; and Jim 
said he knew two splendid boys in school that he 
would like to ask; and when they counted them 
up, they found there were plenty enough. 

They played games, of course, pretty laugh- 
able things that had not gone out of fashion. And 
the supper-table was a feast to the eye as well as 
to the appetite. Toward the last, there were mot- 
toes, and they had a good deal of fun in exchang- 
ing. Doctor Joe was as merry as any boy, in fact, 
he laid himself out, as people say, to make the 
party a success, for Hanny would have been a 
timid little hostess. Dolly and Margaret were 
not much behind. 



After they went upstairs some one proposed the 
Virginia Reel. The older ones were not long in 
taking their places. 

"Come," said Doctor Joe to Daisy Jasper. 
"It's very easy. You will have to learn some 
time." 

" Will I surely have to ? ' and she gave an arch
