They went to the parlor presently, and he sat 
down to the piano, though he winced a little at 
first with a comical sense of disapproval. 

You will spoil your singer’s ear with this 
piano, which could never have been first-class,” he 
said. 

Yes, I’ve wondered if we ought not have a 
new one. I took it with the house.” 

“ I’d like to choose one for my singing-bird,” 
with a fond look at Chan. 

They thought Miss Raynor evoked wonderful 
sounds, but they were spellbound at Mr. Gwynne’s 
music, even if the piano had passed its prime. And 
the eager faces were an inspiration. 

'' Now, I want you to do something for me,” he 



began. Chan — may I call you that ? — I want 
to hear again what you were singing to that little 
Arthur. It struck me as being strangely beautiful, 
and has haunted me.” 

“ Oh, it’s so much prettier when Goldie sings. 
You see — we caught it from the birds, there were 
so many over at the old house, and down in the 
woods.” 

Goldie was a bit bashful. We haven’t any 
words to it,” she said. 

I don’t want any words, only just the melody.” 

“ Oh, come, Goldie ; Mr. Gwynne’s so nice, you 
needn’t feel afraid.” 

Mr. Gwynne colored and smiled at the compli- 
ment. 

You begin,” said Goldie. 

It was a little bird in some far-off thicket just at 
daybreak, when hardly a leaf stirred, growing 
clearer with a longing note, then another an- 
swered, then they blended, there was a newer one, 
then there seemed half a dozen, until it was the 
poet’s “ sweet jargoning.” A clear high sound — 
a bird flying upward, growing fainter and fainter, 
broken up by a nearer, merry whistle, soft low 
notes again — the thrush, the lilt of the robin, the 
gayety of the mocking-bird, then something plain- 
tively sweet. 




Mr. Gwynne was noting it down with his pen- 
cil on a pad, raising his eyes now and then to look 
at the two children. Chan’s face was rapt with 
the melody. They both paused and drew a long 
breath. 

“ That is remarkable,” he said. “ It would set 
some audiences wild. I have part of a cornet solo, 
and this is just what I wanted. Next winter, chil- 
dren, you shall hear it played. I have a young 
pupil who will some day be a celebrated player. I 
wonder if you have ever heard a cornet? ” 

I don’t think we know just what it is,” said 
Linn. 

Well, a fine player makes it an inspiration. I 
have been saving up bits for it, and that was what 
caught my attention at the hospital, only I thought 
first it was a bird. Chan, you ought to be a com- 
poser — you may be some day. Do all of you sing? 
Where did you get such remarkable talent ? ” 

We sing at things,” said Primrose dryly. 

I believe I could give a concert with you alone. 
What are you smiling at ? ” 

Prim was rosy red. 

Prim can’t carry a tune,” said Linn. “ She 
wanders off in the funniest way.” 

“ I can sing with the others in Sunday-school 
because I follow the sound, but when I’m alone I
