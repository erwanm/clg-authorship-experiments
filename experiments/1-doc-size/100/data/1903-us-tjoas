standpoint I believe there are things in The Cap- 
tive that would meet with a reception not satis- 
factory to either of us, Mr. Stirling." 

(Perplexity on my part.) " You'll have to 
explain that to me, I fear." 

" Why — but the explaining of that would be 
to offer you my opinion about the book " 

" I should be very pleased to hear it. Your 






reason for declining it, then, is not altogether that 
it is a blank-verse drama? " 

" Not altogether, Mr. Stirling. It's a little 
difficult for me to tell you about these things, you 
know. I understand that the book must have 
meant a great deal to you, and so I am naturally 
diffident. But if you will pardon my saying so, 
it seems to me that the book — it is obviously, of 
course, the work of a young man — it is very 
emotional, it strives to very high altitudes. I 
will not say that it is exaggerated, but — the last 
part particularly — it seems to me that you are 
writing in too high a key, that your voice is 
strained." (An uncomfortable pause.) " Of 
course, now, that is but my opinion. It will not 
seem of any value to you, perhaps, but while I 
read it I could not get away from the fact that it 
was not altogether natural. It seemed hysterical 
and overwrought in places — it gives the effect of 
crudeness. It is rather hard, you know, to ex- 
pect a man who sits at a desk all day to follow you 
in such very strenuous flights." (A slight laugh.) 

" Mind you it is not that I do not appreciate 
high qualities, Mr. Stirling, it is merely that it 
seemed to me that if it were toned down some- 
what it would be better — you know such things 


strike different people in different ways; you do 
not find it easy to believe that it would affect 
men so — but I am pretty sure that the impulse 
of the average critic would be to go still further — 
to make fun of it. Here, for instance — let me 
read you the opinion upon the book that was 
handed in by one of our most experienced readers 
— etc., etc. — " 

I have told enough of that story, giving the 
conversation as literally as I can recall it. I am 
always a fool, the presence of other men over- 
awes me; I sit meek and take all that comes, and 
then make my escape. The great publishers' 
manager still thinks he impressed me with his 
wisdom — he has half an idea I'm going to " tone 
down " The Captive! 

— He read me that criticism — great God, it 
makes me writhe! It was like a review of the 
Book of Revelations by Bill Nye. 

That my work should be judged by such men! 

—"Exaggerated!" "Hysterical!" And is 
there nothing hysterical in life, then? And 
would you go through battle and pestilence with 
the same serenity that you sit there at your desk 
all day, you publisher? 



As if a man who was being torn to pieces 
would converse after the manner of Mr. Howells 
and Jane Austen! 

— " Tone it down! " That bit of inanity has 
been haunting my ears. Tone down The Cap- 
tive! Tone down the faith and rapture of my 
whole life, until it is what the reading public will 
find natural! — And tone down the Liebes-Tod 
— and tone down the Choral Symphony — and 
Epipsychidion — and King Lear! 

Swounds, show me what thou'lt do : 

Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't 

tear thyself ? 
Woo't drink up eisel ? Eat a crocodile ? 
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine ? 
To outface me with leaping in her grave ? 
Be buried quick with her, and so will I :
