" Well, now, he doesn't seem to have made much use of his 
early years," returned Dale thoughtfully. "Some pedple 





are born to luck, and when the time comes, there it is. One 
of the poorest and most shiftless men I ever knew — hung 
around after my wife's sister five or six year, then went off 
to Michigan, and, gad ! if he didn't get rich — found a 
copper mine good as gold. I guess Liz was sorry then she 
hadn't waited." 

The two men, who had been business partners for the last 
seven years often indulged in a little retrospection when 
they were not too much engrossed, and it generally began 
with their young comrade Winterburne. They give him 
his own head, sure of his not getting far out of the way. 

" 'Twould be queer now if he just lighted on something 
else," said Graniss musingly. " Then we shall be sure the 
luck is with him." 

The luck, if that is it, is with him. Under his directions 
the men have broken the ground. He takes a hand with 
the pick, and studies the debris that is thrown up. Down 
about four feet, one of the men comes upon a solid layer 
with unmistakable indications. The opening has to be 
widened. An irregularly shaped seam of sienite, mingled 
with grains of magnetic ore and various other minerals, 
meets their expectant eyes. 

" You're in luck, master ! " exclaims the brawny Lanca- 
shire man. "How's happen theer's bin no eyes sharp 
enow to cast up that, an' tha a-traipsen back an' furth aii' 
rattlin' 'er magnet, as it were ghaist shaken ? Kim an' 
look at thet now ! " 

Winterburne recognizes the find. "Go on," he says a 
little huskily. * 

They uncover the vein for several feet, but they go 
beyond the Bradley boundaries before its width is reached. 
The debris is removed with fresh ejaculations. Winter- 
burne comes forward with his rule. 

" Na, ua, master, we're na gotten to tha end ; " and the 
workmen grin at each other. " Tha's fund the best one 
yet, an' surfis workin's cheap." 

Well, he has defrauded no one. It has been a luoky 
hazard, a rather unusual combination of circumstances. 



 

He wanted Bradley's to come up to the old price ; he Would 
have laid it all at Mrs. Halford's feet if he could. And he 
regrets a little that he cannot share his good fortune with 
them. 

They do presently arrive at a bed of gneiss rock. The 
measurement is eleven feet. What the length may be is 
beyond any present calculation. 

" Now," says Winterburne, " let us take out some ore at 
once, and fill the wagon. There will be time between this 
and night. Braxton, you go and order the car to remain, 
or to return if it has gone in." 

For the tracks have been repaired, and the hand-cars 
take in the iron. 

When they reach home the last man has gone from the 
furnace. The great space is full of pigs of the latest 
casting. Dale is puttering about in the fashion considered 
as belonging chiefly to women. 

" You've struck it ! " he says to Winterburne. 

The man addressed laughs genially. 

"I've not made a bad bargain, I think. A few days ago 
I bought Finter's bit of laud on the mountain-side. Half 
the vein at least is there." 

" Dang it, man ! you were born for luck ! " and Dale 
stabs the ground with an iron bar near by. 

" Wait until the furnace gives a verdict," he replies with 
a sort of boyish carelessness, yet the under strata in his 
tone is hope. i'. 

That is done the next day. The analysis surprises Dale, 
who has seen so many specimens tried in the fiery furnace. 
There is no sulphur, very slight traces of phosphoric acid, 
little insoluble matter, and assays over eighty per cent of 
pure metal. It is certainly a most fortunate find, unless
