“I see, it is all my fault,” said Mr. Query. “And I will do anything
to remedy it. I never could believe you drank--and now I’ll go and tell
everybody that the report was false.”

“Oh! bless you,” cried the doctor, “I wouldn’t have you do so for the
world. All I ask of you, is to say nothing whatever on the subject, and
if you ever again hear a report of the kind, don’t make it a subject of
friendly investigation.”

Mr. Query promised; and, after the truth was known, and, Dr. Harvey
had regained the good-will of the community, together with his share of
medical practice, he never had reason again to exclaim--“Save me from
my friends!” And Mr. Query was in future exceedingly careful how he
attempted to make friendly investigations.




ROOM IN THE WORLD.



     THERE is room in the world for the wealthy and great,
     For princes to reign in magnificent state;
     For the courtier to bend, for the noble to sue,
     If the hearts of all these are but honest and true.

     And there’s room in the world for the lowly and meek,
     For the hard horny hand, and the toil-furrow’d cheek;
     For the scholar to think, for the merchant to trade,
     So these are found upright and just in their grade.

     But room there is none for the wicked; and nought
     For the souls that with teeming corruption are fraught.
     The world would be small, were its oceans all land,
     To harbour and feed such a pestilent band.

     Root out from among ye, by teaching the mind,
     By training the heart, this chief curse of mankind!
     ‘Tis a duty you owe to the forthcoming race--
     Confess it in time, and discharge it with grace!




WORDS.



“THE foolish thing!” said my Aunt Rachel, speaking warmly, “to get hurt
at a mere word. It’s a little hard that people can’t open their lips but
somebody is offended.”

“Words are things!” said I, smiling.

“Very light things! A person must be tender indeed, that is hurt by a
word.”

“The very lightest thing may hurt, if it falls on a tender place.”

“I don’t like people who have these tender places,” said Aunt Rachel. “I
never get hurt at what is said to me. No--never! To be ever picking
and mincing, and chopping off your words--to be afraid to say this or
that--for fear somebody will be offended! I can’t abide it.”

“People who have these tender places can’t help it, I suppose. This
being so, ought we not to regard their weakness?” said I. “Pain,
either of body or mind, is hard to bear, and we should not inflict it
causelessly.”

“People who are so wonderfully sensitive,” replied Aunt Rachel, growing
warmer, “ought to shut themselves up at home, and not come among
sensible, good-tempered persons. As far as I am concerned, I can tell
them, one and all, that I am not going to pick out every hard word from
a sentence as carefully as I would seeds from a raisin. Let them crack
them with their teeth, if they are afraid to swallow them whole.”

Now, for all that Aunt Rachel went on after this strain, she was a kind,
good soul, in the main, and, I could see, was sorry for having hurt the
feelings of Mary Lane. But she didn’t like to acknowledge that she was
in the wrong; that would detract too much from the self-complacency with
which she regarded herself. Knowing her character very well, I thought
it best not to continue the little argument about the importance of
words, and so changed the subject. But, every now and then, Aunt Rachel
would return to it, each time softening a little towards Mary. At last
she said,

“I’m sure it was a little thing. A very little thing. She might have
known that nothing unkind was intended on my part.”

“There are some subjects, aunt,” I replied, “to which we cannot bear the
slightest allusion. And a sudden reference to them is very apt to throw
us off of our guard. What you said to Mary has, in all probability
touched some weakness of character, or probed some wound that time
has not been able to heal. I have always thought her a sensible,
good-natured girl.”

“And so have I. But I really cannot think that she has showed her good
sense or good nature in the present case. It is a very bad failing this,
