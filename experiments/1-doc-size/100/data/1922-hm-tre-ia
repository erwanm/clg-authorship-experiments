him, and his head would cease to roll from side to 
side. He hung precariously on the ragged edge, 
but he hung there. Three times he uttered a phrase: 

"A djinn m a blue-serge coat!" 

And each time he would follow it with a chuckle—' 
the chuckle of a soul in danmation. 

Neither the American Express nor Cook's had re- 
ceived mail for Howard Taber; he was not on either 
list. This was irregular. A man might be without 





relatives, but certainly he would not be without 
friends, that is to say, without letters. The a£Fair was 
thick with sinister suggestions. And yet, the doctor 
recalled an expression of the girl's: that it was not a 
dissipated face, only troubled. 

The whole affair interested him deeply. That was 
one of the compensations for having consigned him- 
self to this part of the world. Over here, there was 
generally some unusual twist to a case. He would 
pull this young fellow back; but later he knew that 
he would have to fight the boy's lack of will to live. 
When he recovered his mental faculties, he would lie 
there, neutral; they could save him or let him die, as 
they pleased; and the doctor knew that he would 
wear himself out forcing his own will to live into this 
neutrality. And probably the girl would wear her- 
self out, too. 

To fight inertia on the one hand and to study this 
queer girl on the other. Any financial return was 
inconsiderable against the promise of this psychologi- 
cal treat. The girl was like some north-country 
woodland pool, penetrated by a single shaft of sun- 
light —  beautifully clear in one spot and mysteriously 
obscured elsewhere. She would be elemental; there 
would be in her somewhere the sleeping tigress. The 
elemental woman was always close to the cat: as the 
elemental man was always but a point removed from 
the wolf. 

It was so arranged that Ruth went on duty after 



 

breakfast and remained until noon. The afternoon 
was her own; but from eight until midnight she sat 
beside the patient. At no time did she feel bodily 
or mental fatigue. Frequently she would doze in her 
chair; but the slightest movement on the bed aroused 
her. 

At luncheon, on the third day, a thick-set man 
with a blue jaw smiled across his table at her. She 
recogm'zed him as the man who had blundered into 
the wrong room. 

How is the patient?" he asked. 
He will live ' answered Ruth. 
That's fine ' said O'Higgins. "I suppose he'll 
be on his feet any day now." 

"No. It will take at least three weeks." 

"Well, so long as he gets on his feet in the end. 
You're a friend of the young man? " 

"K you mean did I know him before he became 

ill> no."   

"Ah." O'Higgins revolved this information 
about, but no angle emitted light. Basically a kindly 
man but made cynical and derisive by sordid con' 
tacts, O'Higgins had almost forgotten that there 
was such a thing as unselfishness. The man or 
woman who did something for nothing always ex- 
cited his suspicions; they were playing some kind of 
a game. "You mean you were just sorry for him?" 
"As I would be for any human being in pain." 
"Uh-huh." For the life of him, O'Higgins could 








not think of anything else to say. Just because she 
was sorry for that young fool! "Uh-huh ' he re-
