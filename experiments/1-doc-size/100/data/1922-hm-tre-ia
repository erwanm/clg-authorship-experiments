words, sounds; she could not construct these words
and sounds into objects; or» if she did, invariably 
missed the mark. Her education was remarkable 
in that it was overdeveloped here and underdeveloped 
there: the woman of thirty and the child of ten were 
always getting in each other's way. Until she had 
left her island, what she heard and what she saw 
were truths. And now she was discovering that eva 
Nature was something of a har, with her mirages and 
her horizons. 

At the present moment she was living in a world 
of her own creation, a carnival of brave men and 
fair women, characters out of the tales she had so 
newly read for the first time. She could not resist 
enduing persons she met with the noble attributes of 
the fictional characters. We all did that in our youth, 
when first we came upon a fine story; else we were 
worthless metal indeed. So, step by step, and hurt 
by hurt, Ruth was learning that John Smith was 
John Smith and nobody else. 

Presently she was again in that dreadful tavern of 
the Th6nardiers. That was the wonder of these 
stories; one Hved in them. Cosette sat under the 
table, still as a mouse, fondling her pitiful doll. Dolls. 
Ruth's gaze wandered from the printed page. She 
had never had a real doll. Instinct had forced her to 
create something out of rags to satisfy a mysterious 



 

ci-Aving. But a doll that rolled its eyes and had 
Q.a en hair! Except for the manual labour —  there 
h.£ul been natives to fetch and carry — she and Cosette 
Tv ere sisters in loneliness. 

Perhaps an hoiu' passed before she laid aside the 
book. A bobbing lantern, crossing the bridge —  for 
slie had not drawn the curtain —  attracted her attention. She turned oflf the Kght and approached the 
i?vindow. She saw a pole-chair; that would be this 
IMx. Taber returning. Evidently Ah Cum's luck had 
held good. 

As she stared her eyes grew accustomed to the 
rdght; and she discovered five persons instead of four. 
She remembered Taber's hat. (What was the name 
he had given her that day?) He was walking beside 
the chair upon which appeared to be a bundle of 
colours. She could not see clearly. All at once her 
heart began to patter queerly. He was bringing the 
sing-song girl to the hotel ! 

The strange cort e presently vanished below the 
window-sill. Curiosity to see what a sing-song girl 
was like took possession of Ruth's thoughts. She 
fought the incHnation for a while, then surrendered. 
She was still fully dressed; so all she had to do was to 
pause before the mirror and give her hair a few pats. 
Mirrors. Prior to the great adventure, her mirrors had been the still pools in the rocks after the ebb. 
She had never been able to discover where her father 
had hidden his shaving mirror. 








When she entered the office a strange scene was 
presented to her startled gaze. The sing-song girl, 
her fiddle broken, was beating her forehead upon the 
floor and wailing: Ai  ail Aiy ail Spurlock — or 
Taber, as he called himself — sat slumped in a chair, 
staring with glazed eyes at nothing, absolutely un- 
interested in the confusion for which he was primar- 
ily accountable. The hotel manager was expostulat- 
ing and Ah Cum was replying by a series of 
expressive shrugs. 

What has happened? " Ruth asked. 
A drunken idea," said Ah Cum, taking his hands 
out of his sleeves. "I could not make him under- 
stand." 

"She cannot stay here," the manager de- 
clared. 

"Why does she weep? " Ruth wanted to know. 

Ah Cum explained. "She considers her future 
blasted beyond hope. Mr. Taber did not leave all his 
money in the office. He insisted on buying this girl 
for two hundred mex. He now tells her that she is 
free, no longer a slave. She doesn't understand; she 
believes he has taken a sudden dislike to her. Free, 
there is nothing left to her but the canal. Until two
