Across the hall were two rooms again, but one 
had the old-fashioned high -post bedstead just as 
it had been left at Grandmother Palmer's death, 
and was used as a guest chamber, though Roy 
kept his desk and his business papers there, and 
last winter had added a bookcase. 

" What do you suppose keeps that girl ? " she 
exclaimed impatiently, glancing up at the young 
man. 

" Perhaps she is making herself pretty to dis 
arm you," with a mischievous glint in his eye. 

"Well she needn't. Handsome is as hand 
some does to my mind. And I shall try and 
make her useful though she doesn't look good 
for much." 

" Don't be too hard on her, Aunt Hannah," 
said Roy, with a kind of tender good humor that 
was part of his nature. Everything needing pro 
tection seemed to gravitate to him naturally. 

" I don't want to be hard, Royal Palmer. I 
never was hard to her" that meant Bessie's 



 

mother; "but I can't afford to keep her a lady, 
and I've no fortune to give her. And if she 
shouldn't like housework modern girls despise 
it," and there was a fling in Aunt Hannah's voice, 
" I'll see if Miss Cummings won't take her at dress 
making. She must have some way of getting her 
living. Helpless, wishy-washy women on the look 
out for husbands are my abomination ! I pity the 
men who get them ! " 

" But you don't pity the men who want capable 
women." 

Aunt Hannah really colored up. Westhorpe 
was not in ignorance of that episode, happening 
only a few years ago, when Aunt Hannah was 
sorely wanted. 

" I always took it as a compliment that Rachel 
Marks wanted me to be stepmother to her chil 
dren. Rachel was a nice, sensible body, but I 
never could see how she made up her mind to 
Silas. I'd have done it for her sake and the chil 
dren's if I could." 

Aunt Hannah was growing impatient now. She 
opened the stair door and called in a quick tone : 

" Bessie Deane, will you come to supper ! " 

Bessie Deane, to show her independent spirit, 
still lingered. 

"Sit down," said Aunt Hannah, peremptorily. 
" We shall not wait for a slip of a girl." 




She had poured the tea and passed the bread 
when Bessie entered. 

" I am glad I did not keep you waiting," in a 
soft, winsome voice, with a deprecating glance at 
Roy. 

" No," answered Aunt Hannah, in a brief, deci 
sive tone. " We were ready and sat down. Do 
you take cream and sugar in your tea ? " 

Bessie answered in a rather ignoble affirmative. 
Then she tried to make some conversation with 
Roy, but he did not seem in the mood. Or was 
he afraid of this tall, stern-looking ogre ; a very 
masculine sort of woman, Bessie decided. He 
had been chatty enough on the homeward drive. 

Afterward he walked down to the post-office 
for the mail, and for the talk he would have with 
Bernard Ward. Aunt Hannah took Tim's supper 
out in the shed kitchen. Part of this was floored, 
and all but one end lathed and plastered. That 
side was piled almost up to the ceiling the roof 
slanted considerably with wood, split and sawed 
in even lengths. There were various barrels and 
one closet for storing away things. A long wash 
bench, and a pine table with two wooden chairs 
comprised the furniture. Then she brought in a 
small cedar tub and washed her tea things.
