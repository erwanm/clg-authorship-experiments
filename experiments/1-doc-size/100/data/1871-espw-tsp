man must appear, from force of circumstances, to 
pass the — the wounded part of the world by 
upon the other side. And I believe, before God, 
that I would begin over again in East Street
tomorrow, if I could help to bind it up, and set it 
healthily upon its way ! " 

Perley believes he would, and says so, solemnly. 





She says too, very earnestly, that she cannot 
think it to be true that a man who holds to such 
a purpose, and who holds it with — she falters — 
with such a smile, can permanently and inevitably 
be misunderstood and pained. She cannot 
think it. 

Stephen Garrick shakes his head. 

" I suspect there always are and always will 
be a few rich men, Miss Kelso, who just because 
they are rich men will be forever mistranslated 
by the suffering poor, and I suspect that I am 
one of them. I do not know that it matters. 
Let us talk of something else." 

" Of something else than suffering and poverty .? 
Mr. Garrick," — Perley turns her young face 
against the west, where the sultry storm is 
crouching and springing, — "why, Mr. Garrick! 
sometimes I do not see — in God's name I do not 
see — what else there can be to talk about in 
such a world as this ! I 've stepped into it, as we 
have stepped out into this storm. It has wrapped 
me in, — it has wrapped me in ! " 

The sultry rain wraps them in, as they beat 
against it, heavily. It is not until a little lurid 
tongue of light eats its way through and over the 





hill, and strikes low and sidewise against the wet 
clovers that brush against their feet, that Perley 
breaks a silence into which they fall, to say, in a 
changed tone, " It is not an uncommon case, this 
old man's?" and that Mr. Garrick tells her, "Not 
an uncommon case " ; and that she leaves him, 
nodding, at the corner of the road, and climbs the 
hill alone ; and that he stands in the breaking 
storm for a moment there to watch her, brushing 
gilded wet clovers down about her as she climbs. 







CHAPTER IX. 

A FANCY CASE. 

' THE oculist shut the door. For a popular 

 oculist, with a specialty for fancy cases, 

he looked disturbed. 

A patient in waiting — a mild, near-sighted 

« 
case — asked what was the matter with the 

girl. 

" Why, the creature 's deaf and dumb ! " 

" Not growing blind, I hope ? " 

" Incurably blind. A factory-girl, a charity 
case of Miss Kelso's. You know of Miss Kel- 
so, Mr. Blodgett .' " 

Mr. Blodgett knew, he thought. The young 
lady from whom Wiggins bought that new house 
on the Mill-Dam. An eccentric young lady, 
buried herself in Five Falls ever since the old 
gentleman's death, broke an engagement, and 
was interested in labor reform, or something 
of that description.
