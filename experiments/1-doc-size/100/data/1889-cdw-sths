Illinois has the reputation of being slow in matters of education and
reform. A day in the State offices, however, will give the visitor an
impression of intelligence and vigor in these directions. The office of
the State Board of Pharmacy in the Capitol shows a strict enforcement of
the law in the supervision of drugs and druggists. Prison management has
also most intelligent consideration. The two great penitentiaries, the
Southern, at Chester (with about 800 convicts), and the Northern, at
Joliet (with about 1600 convicts), call for no special comment. The
one at Joliet is a model of its kind, with a large library, and such
schooling as is practicable in the system, and is well administered;
and I am glad to see that Mr. McClaughry, the warden, believes that
incorrigibles should be permanently held, and that grading, the
discipline of labor and education, with a parole system, can make
law-abiding citizens of many convicts.

In school education the State is certainly not supine in efforts. Out
of a State population of about 8,500,000, there were, in 1887, 1,627,841
under twenty-one years, and 1,096,464 between the ages of six
and twenty-one. The school age for free attendance is from six to
twenty-one; for compulsory attendance, from eight to fourteen. There
were 749,994 children enrolled, and 500,197 in daily attendance. Those
enrolled in private schools numbered 87,725. There were 2258 teachers in
private schools, and 22,925 in public schools; of this latter, 7402 were
men and 15,403 women. The average monthly salary of men was $51.48,
and of women $42.17. The sum available for school purposes in 1887 was
$12,890,515, in an assessed value of taxable property of $797,752,888.
These figures are from Dr. X. W. Edwards, Superintendent of Public
Instruction, whose energy is felt In every part of the State.

The State prides itself on its institutions of charity. I saw some of
them at Jacksonville, an hour’s ride west of Springfield. Jacksonville
is a very pretty city of some 15,000, with elm-shaded avenues that crest
but do not rival New Haven—one of those intellectual centres that are
a continual surprise to our English friends in their bewildered
exploration of our monotonous land. In being the Western centre of
Platonic philosophy, it is more like Concord than like New Haven. It
is the home of a large number of people who have travelled, who give
intelligent attention to art, to literary study in small societies and
clubs—its Monday Evening Club of men long antedated most of the similar
institutions at the East—and to social problems. I certainly did not
expect to find, as I did, water-colors by Turner in Jacksonville,
besides many other evidences of a culture that must modify many Eastern
ideas of what the West is and is getting to be.

The Illinois College is at Jacksonville. It is one of twenty-five small
colleges in the State, and I believe the only one that adheres to the
old curriculum, and does not adopt co-education. It has about sixty
students in the college proper, and about one hundred and thirty in
the preparatory academy. Most of the Illinois colleges have preparatory
departments, and so long as they do, and the various sects scatter their
energies among so many institutions, the youth of the State who wish a
higher education will be obliged to go East. The school perhaps the most
vigorous just now is the University of Illinois, at Urbana, a school
of agriculture and applied science mainly. The Central Hospital for the
Insane (one of three in the State), under the superintendence of Dr.
Henry F. Carriel, is a fine establishment, a model of neatness and good
management, with over nine hundred patients, about a third of whom do
some light work on the farm or in the house. A large conservatory of
plants and flowers is rightly regarded as a remedial agency in the
treatment of the patients. Here also is a fine school for the education
of the blind.

The Institution for the Education of Deaf-Mutes, Dr. Philip H. Gillette,
superintendent, is, I believe, the largest in the world, and certainly
one of the most thoroughly equipped and successful in its purposes. It
has between five hundred and six hundred pupils. All the departments
found in many other institutions are united here. The school has a
manual training department; articulation is taught; the art school
exhibits surprising results in aptitude for both drawing and painting;
and industries are taught to the extent of giving every pupil a trade
or some means of support—shoemaking, cabinet-making, printing, sewing,
gardening, and baking.

Such an institution as this raises many interesting questions. It is
at once evident that the loss of the sense of hearing has an effect on
character, moral and intellectual. Whatever may be the education of
the deaf-mute, he will remain, in some essential and not easily to be
characterized respects, different from other people. It is exceedingly
hard to cultivate in them a spirit of self-dependence, or eradicate the
notion that society owes them perpetual care and support. The education
of deaf-mutes, and the teaching them trades, so that they become
intelligent and productive members of society, of course induce
marriages among them. Is not this calculated to increase the number
of deaf-mutes? Dr. Gillette thinks not. The vital statistics show that
consanguineous marriages are a large factor in deaf-muteism; about
ten per cent., it is estimated, of the deaf-mutes are the offspring of
parents related by blood. Ancestral defects are not always perpetuated
in kind; they may descend in physical deformity, in deafness, in
imbecility. Deafness is more apt to descend in collateral branches than
in a straight line. It is a striking fact in a table of relationships
prepared by Dr. Gillette that, while the 450 deaf-mutes enumerated had
770 relationships to other deaf-mutes, making a total of 1220, only
twelve of them had deaf-mute parents, and only two of them one deaf-mute
parent, the mother of these having been able to hear, and that in no
case was the mother alone a deaf-mute. Of the pupils who have left this
institution, 251 have married deaf-mutes, and 19 hearing persons. These
marriages have been as fruitful as the average, and among them all only
sixteen have deaf-mute children; in some of the families having a deaf
child there are other children who hear. These facts, says the report,
clearly indicate that the probability of deaf offspring from deaf
