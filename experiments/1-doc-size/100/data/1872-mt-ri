sheep and cow. In the wofully dusty horseman in charge of 
the expedition I recognized John . Of all persons in the 
world to meet on top of the 
Rocky Mountains thousands 
of miles from home,he was the 
last one I should have looked 
for. We were school-boys together and wann friends 
for years. But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this 
friendship and it had never been renewed. 
The act of which I speak was this. I had been ac- 
customed to visit occasionally an editor whose room 
was in the third story of a building and overlooked the 
street. One day this editor gave me a watermelon 
li von.Eo THE MELON. M'hkh I uiadc preparations 
to devour on the spot, but chancing to look out of the 
window, I saw John standing directly under it and an 
irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his 
head, which I immediately did. I was the losei*, for it spoiled 
the melon, and John never forgave me and we dropped 
all intercourse and parted, but now met again mider these 
circumstances. 
We recognized each other simultaneously, and hands 
were grasped as warmly as if no coldness had ever existed 
between us, and no allusion was made to any. All animosities 
were bm*ied and the simple fact of meeting a familiar face in 
that isolated spot so far from home, was sufficient to make us 
forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted again with 
sincere " good-byes " and " God bless you " from both. 
We had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Kocky 
Mountains for many tedious hours — we started down them, 
now. And we went spinning away at a round rate too. 
We left the snowy Wind Eiver Mountains and Uinta 
Mountains behind, and sped away, always through splendid 
scenery but occasionally through long ranks of white skele- 
tons of mules and oxen monuments of the huge 
emigration of other days — and here and there 
were up-ended boards or small piles of stones 
which the driver said marked the 
resting-place Ot given over to the cayote and the ra-t:n. 
more precious remains. It was the loneliest land for a grave ! 
A land given over to the cayote and the raven — which is
but another name for desolation and utter solitude. On damp, 
murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a soft, hideous glow, like 
very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague desert. It 
was because of the pliospliorus in the bones. But no scientific 
explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted 
by one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it. 
At midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything 
like it — indeed, I did not even see this, for it was too dark. 
"We fastened down the curtains and even caulked them with 
clothing, but the rain streamed in in twenty places, notwith- 
standing. There was no escape. If one moved his feet out 
of a stream, he brought his body under one ; and if he moved 
his body he caught one somewhere else. If he struggled out 
of the drenched blankets and sat up, he was bound to get one 
down the back of his neck. Meantime the stage was wander- 
ing about a plain with gaping gullies in it, for the driver could 
not see an inch before his face nor keep the road , and the 
storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses 
still, "With the first abatement the conductor turned out with 
lanterns to look for the road, and the first dash he made was 
into a chasm about fourteen feet deep, his lantern following 
like a meteor. As soon as  he touched bottom he sang 
'don't come here." M'e had wandered and out frantically : 
" Don't come here ! " 
To which the driver, who was looking over the precipice
where he had disappeared, replied, with an injured air : 
" Think I'm a dam fool?" 
The conductor was more than an hour finding the road 
— a matter which showed us what chances we had been 
He traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of 
how far taking danger, in two places. I have always 
been glad that we were not killed that night. I do 
not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad. 
In the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green 
River, a fine, large, limpid stream — stuck in it, with the water 
just up to the top of our mail-bed, and waited till extra teams- 
were put on to haul us up the steep bank. But it was nice 
cool water, and besides it could not find any fresh place on us 
to wet. 
At the Green River station we had breakfast — hot biscuits,, 
fresh antelope steaks, and cofi'ee — the only decent meal we 
tasted between the United States and Great Salt Lake City, 
and the only one we were 
ever really thankful for. 
Think of the monotonous 
execrableness of the thirty 
that went before it, to leave 
this one simple breakfast 
looming up in my memory 
like a shot-tower after all 
these years have gone by ! 
At five P.M. we reached 
Fort Bridger, one hundred 
and seventeen miles from 
the South Pass, and one 
thousand and twenty-five miles from St. Joseph. Fifty-twon 
miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met sixty 
United States soldiers from Camp Floyd. The day before, they 
had fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom
