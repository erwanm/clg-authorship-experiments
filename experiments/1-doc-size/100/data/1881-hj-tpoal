" It was riot to honour you I did it ; I have called on you 
before, and I know you don't like it. It was to talk to you a 
little about something." 

He looked for a moment at the buckle in her hat. " I shall 
be very glad to hear what you wish to say." 

"You don't like to talk with me," said Henrietta. "But I 
don't care for that ; I don't talk for your amusement. I wrote 
a word to ask you to come and see me ; but since I have met 
you here this will do as well." 

" I was just going away," Goodwood said ; " but of course I 
will stop." He was civil, but he was not enthusiastic. 

Henrietta, however, never looked for great professions, and 
she was so much in earnest that she was thankful he would listen 
to her on any terms. She asked him first, however, if he had 
seen all the pictures. 

" All I want to. I have been here an hour." 

" I wonder if you have seen my Correggio," said Henrietta. 



 

" I came up on purpose to have a look at it." She went into 
the Tribune, and he slowly accompanied her. 

" I suppose I have seen it, but I didn't know it was yours. 
I don't remember pictures especially that sort." She had 
pointed out her favourite work ; and he asked her if it was 
about Correggio that she wished to talk with him. 

"  "o," said Henrietta, "it's about something less harmonious !" 
They had the small, brilliant room, a splendid cabinet of trea- 
sures, to themselves ; there was only a custode hovering about, 
the Medicean Venus. " I want you to do me a favour," Miss 
Stackpole went on. 

Caspar Goodwood frowned a little, but he expressed no em- 
barrassment at the sense of not looking eager. His face was 
that of a much older man than our earlier friend. " I'm sure 
it's something I shan't like," he said, rather loud. 

" No, I don't think you will like it. If you did, it would be 
no favour." 

"Well, let us hear it," he said, in the tone of a man quite 
conscious of his own reasonableness. 

"You may say there is no particular reason why you should 
do me a favour. Indeed, I only know of one : the fact that if 
you would let me I would gladly do you one." Her soft, exact 
tone, in which there was no attempt at effect, had an extreme 
sincerity ; and her companion, though he presented rather a 
hard surface, could not help being touched by it. When he 
was touched he rarely showed it, however, by the usual signs ; 
he neither blushed, nor looked away, nor looked conscious. He 
only fixed his attention more directly ; he seemed to consider 
with added firmness. Henrietta went on therefore disinterest- 
edly, without the sense of an advantage. " I may say now, 
indeed it seems a good time that if I have ever annoyed you 
(and I think sometimes that I have), it is because I knew that 
I was willing to suffer annoyance for you. I have troubled you 
doubtless. But I would take trouble for you." 

Goodwood hesitated. " You are taking trouble now." 

" Yes, I am, some. I want you to consider whether it is 
better on the whole that you should go to Rome." 

" I thought you were going to say that ! " Goodwood ex- 
claimed, rather artlessly. 

" You have considered it, then ? " 

" Of course I have, very carefully. I have looked all round 
it. Otherwise I shouldn't have come as far as this. That's 
what I stayed in Pa'ris two months for; I was thinking it 
over." 



" I am afraid you decided as you liked. You decided it was 
"best, because you were so much attracted." 

" Best for whom, do you mean?" Goodwood inquired. 

" Well, for yourself first. For Mrs. Osmond next." 

" Oh, it won't do her any good ! I don't flatter myself that." 

" Won't it do her harm ? that's the question." 

" I don't see what it will matter to her. I am nothing to 
Mrs. Osmond. But if you want to know, I do want to see her
