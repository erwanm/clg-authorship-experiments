Whites of two eggs, beaten to a froth.

1 cup of powdered sugar.

¼ pound grated chocolate, wet in 1 table-spoonful cream.

1 teaspoonful vanilla.

Beat the sugar into the whipped whites; then the chocolate. Whisk all
together hard for three minutes before adding the vanilla. Let the cake
get quite cold before you spread it. Reserve a little of the mixture
for the top, and beat more sugar into this to form a firm icing.


APPLE CAKE. +

2 cups powdered sugar.

3 cups of flour.

½ cup corn-starch, wet up with a little milk.

½ cup of butter, rubbed to light cream with sugar.

½ cup sweet milk.

1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted with flour.

½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.

6 eggs, the whites only, whipped very stiff.

Add the milk to the creamed butter and sugar; the soda-water,
corn-starch, then the flour and whites alternately. Bake in jelly cake
tins.

Filling.

3 tart, well-flavored apples, grated.

1 egg, beaten light.

1 cup of sugar.

1 lemon, grated peel and juice.

Beat sugar and egg up with the lemon. Pare the apples and grate
them directly into this mixture, letting an assistant stir it the
while. The color will be better preserved by this method. Put into a
farina-kettle, with boiling water in the outer vessel, and stir until
it comes to a boil. Let it cool before putting it between the cakes.

It is best eaten fresh.


ORANGE CAKE.

3 table-spoonfuls butter.

2 cups of sugar.

Yolks of 5 eggs, whites of three, beaten separately—the yolks strained
through a sieve after they are whipped.

1 cup of cold water.

3 full cups of flour—enough for good batter.

1 large orange, the juice, and half the grated peel.

½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.

1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted in flour.

Cream the butter and sugar; add the eggs; heat in the orange, the
water, soda, and stir in the flour quickly.

Bake in jelly cake tins.

Filling.

Whites of two eggs, whisked stiff.

1 cup powdered sugar.

Juice, and half the peel of an orange.

Whip very light, and spread between the cakes when cold.

Reserve a little, and whip more sugar into it for frosting on top layer.


CHARLOTTE POLONAISE CAKE. (Very fine.) +
