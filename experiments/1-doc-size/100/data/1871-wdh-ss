home must have caused in him, and the benumbing 
shock of finding it blind and deaf to all his appeals ; 
he saw him sitting down upon what had been his 
own threshold, and waiting in a sort of bewildered 
patience till the neighbors should be awake, while 
the noises of the streets gradually arose, and the 
wheels began to rattle over the stones, and the milk- 
man and the ice-man came and went, and the wait- 
ing figure began to be stared at, and to challenge the 



 

curiosity of the passing policeman ; he fancied the 
opening of the neighbor's door, and the slow, cold 
understanding of the case ; the manner, whatever it 
was, in which the sailor was told that one year be- 
fore his wife had died, with her babe, and that his 
children were scattered, none knew where. As the 
contributor dwelt pityingly upon these things, but at 
the same time estimated their aesthetic value one by 
one, he drew near the head of his street, and found 
himself a few paces behind a boy slouching onward 
through the night, to whom he called out, adventur- 
ously, and with no real hope of information, — 

" Do you happen to know anybody on this street 
by the name of Hapford?" 

" Why no, not in this town," said the boy; but 
he added that there was a street of the same name 
in a neighboring suburb, and that there was a" Hap- 
ford living on it. 

" By Jove I " thought the contributor, " this is 
more like literature than ever ; " and he hardly 
knew whether to be more provoked at his own stu- 
pidity in not thinking of a street of the same name in 
the next village, or delighted at the element of fatal- 
ity which the fact introduced into the story ; for 
Tinker, according to his own account, must have 
landed from the cars a few rods from the very door 
he was -seeking, and so walked fai'ther and farther 
from it every moment. He thought the case so 
curious, that he laid it briefly before the boy, who, 
however he might have been inwardly affected, was 
sufficiently true to the national traditions not tc 




make the smallest conceivable outward sign of con- 
cern in it. 

At home, however, the contributor related his 
adventures and the story of Tinker's life, adding the 
fact that he had just found out where Mr. Hapford 
lived. " It was the only touch wanting," said he ; 
" the whole thing is now perfect." 

" It's too perfect," was answered from a sad enthu- 
siasm. " Don't speak of it ! I can't take it in." 

" But the question is," said the contributor, peni- 
tently taking himself to task for forgetting the hero 
of these excellent misfortunes in his delight at their 
perfection, " how am I to sleep to-night, thinking of 
that poor soul's suspense and uncertainty ? Never 
mind, — I'll be up early, and run over and make 
sure that it is Tinker's Hapford, before he gets out 
here," and have a pleasant surprise for him. Would 
it not be a justifiable coup de thSdtre to fetch his 
daughter here, and let her answer his ring at the 
door when he comes in the morning ? " 

This plan was discouraged. " No, no ; let them 
meet in their own way. Just take him to Hapford's 
house and leave him." 

" Very well. But he's too good a character to 
lose sight of. He's got to come back here and tell 
us what he intends to do." 

The birds, next morning, not having had the sec- 
ond mate on their minds either as an unhappy man 
or a most fortunate episode, but having slept long 
and soundly, were singing in a very sprightly way 
in the way-side trees; and the sweetness of thefa 



 

notes made the contributor's heart light as he 
climbed the hill and rang at Mr. Hapford's door. 

The door was opened by a young girl of fifteen or 
sixteen, whom lie knew at a glance for the second 
mate's daughter, but of whom, for form's sake, he
