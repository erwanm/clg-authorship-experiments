missed me if I had been there." 

" Oh yes, we should," said Corey, " I assure you." 

They looked at each other. 

" I really think I believed I was saying some 
thing," said the girl 

" And so did I," replied the young man. They 
laughed rather wildly, and then they both became 
rather grave. 

He took the chair she gave him, and looked across 
at her, where she sat on the other side of the hearth, 
in a chair lower than his, with her hands dropped in 
her lap, and the back of her head on her shoulders 
as she looked up at him. The soft-coal fire in the 
grate purred and flickered; the drop-light cast a 
mellow radiance on her face. She let her eyes fall, 
and then lifted them for an irrelevant glance at the 
clock on the mantel. 

"Mother and Irene have gone to the Spanish 
Students' concert." 

" Oh, have they ? " asked Corey ; and he put his 
hat, which he had been holding in his hand, on the 
floor beside his chair. 



 

She looked down at it for no reason, and then 
looked up at his face for no other, and turned a 
little red. Corey turned a little red himself. She 
who had always been so easy with him now became 
a little constrained. 

" Do you know how warm it is eut-of -doors ? " he 
asked. 

" No ; is it warm ? I haven't been out all day." 

" It 's like a summer night." 

She turned her face towards the fire, and then 
started abruptly. " Perhaps it 's too warm for you 
here ? " 

" Oh no, it's very comfortable." 

" I suppose it 's the cold of the last few days 
that's still in the house. I was reading with a 
shawl on when you came." 

" I interrupted you." 

" Oh no. I had finished the book. I was just 
looking over it again." 

" Do you like to read books over ? " 

" Yes ; books that I like at all." 

" What was it ? " asked Corey. 

The girl hesitated. " It has rather a senti 
mental name. Did you ever read it ? Tears, Idle 
Tears." 

" Oh yes ; they were talking of that last night ; 
it 's a famous book with ladies. They break their 
hearts over it. Did it make you cry ?" 

" Oh, it 's pretty easy to cry over a book," said 
Penelope, laughing ; " and that one is very natural 
till you come to the main point. Then the natural- 

ness of all the rest makes that seem natural too ; 
but I guess it 's rather forced." 

" Her giving him up to the other one ? " 

" Yes ; simply because she happened to know that 
the other one had cared for him first. Why should 
she have done it$ What right had she ?" 

" I don't know. I suppose that the self-sacri 
fice " 

" But it wasn't self-sacrifice or not self-sacrifice 
alone. She was sacrificing him too ; and for some 
one who couldn't appreciate him half as much as 
she could. I 'm provoked with myself when I think 
how I cried over that book for I did cry. It's 
silly it 's wicked for any one to do what that girl 
did. Why can't they let people have a chance to 
behave reasonably in stories ? "
