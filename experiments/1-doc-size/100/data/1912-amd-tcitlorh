strange to have a little child in his arms — a baby 
girl that he used to long for years ago. 

They all scrambled out. Chan felt rather stiff, 
and rubbed his leg. Mr. Mann tied Bonnie, though 
she was hardly likely to run away, and then lifted 
out the basket of good things. 


 

‘‘Now, you girls must set the table; Tip, can 
you go over yonder and get a pail of water?” 
handing out a small tin pail. 

“ Oh, isn’t it splendid ! ” Prim danced around. 
“ And such lots of good things ! ” 

“ Prim, do behave. You act as if you had 
never seen anything before. Chan, are you 
tired?” and Marigold’s voice was full of solici- 
tude. 

“ I’ll walk around a bit and get rested. It’s 
just — just ” 

“ Supersplacious,” said Prim, laughing, “ and 
salubrious and salutiferous and salutary. I’ve been 
studying the back part of the speller. I mean to 
train for a spelling match.” 

“ I think you’ll do,” laughed Mr. Mann in re- 
turn. “ And an inventor of new words.” 

What an array of tempting things ! Cakes with 
white icing and red icing, cakes with jelly in the 
middle, nuts in a square of something that looked 
like white cream, and as for candies, they had 
never seen the like of half of them. Nuts shelled 
out, except the paper almonds, dainties enough to 
upset the ordinary stomach, a man’s way of pro- 
viding a feast. How they laughed and made 
queer comments and suggestions, and how the 
goodies disappeared! 


 

“ Now you must run around awhile to shake 
down all this stuff. Fll keep the twins, and I 
want Chan. And the rest of the dainties you may 
take home. Or would you rather go with them, 
Chan?’' 

- Well— I think ril stay with you.’’ 

The others started off. They whooped to make 
echoes, they found some swings, and some grapes, 
but they were not enjoyable after the sweet 
things. 

“ And they’re likely to make your tongue sore 
unless they are dead ripe,” Marigold announced. 
“ Oh, we might take some home. They make 
splendid sauce.” 

“ What are you thinking about, Chan? ” 

The boy’s face was grave, rather sad. 

That it was splendid to have plenty of money. 
You can make so many people happy,” the boy 
said simply. 

And happiness was such a great thing! 

‘‘ You can do other things as well.” 

‘‘ But you have to use money for them. Why, 
if you didn’t have money you couldn’t buy seeds, 
and then you wouldn’t have any garden, and if 
you hadn’t any money to buy flour with, you 
couldn’t have any bread, nor clothes, and I want 
to be big and well so I can earn some.” 




I wish you’d tell me about your hip. What 
does the doctor say ? ” 

“ Well — he didn’t know, he told mother. He 
said it wasn’t broken. There’s a doctor over to 
Ridgewood who knows all about such things, but 
he charges twenty-five dollars to talk to you. 
Mother thinks she can save it up by and by. But 
I’m afraid. I don’t want to be cut up,” and he 
shivered. 

“ Perhaps you wouldn’t need to be cut up. You
