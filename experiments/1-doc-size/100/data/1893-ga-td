caressing her. "My sister ! My sister ! Thou 
wilt ! Say that thou wilt ! " But she flung him 
off as if he were a snake. 

" Wilt thou go ? " she asked. 

"Ay ! I go. But he shall suffer. I swear it ! 
I swear it ! " And he rushed from the room. 

Chonita sat there, staring more fixedly at the 
floor than when Estenega had left her.

Reinaldo did not go to his Prudencia. He 
went down to the booths in the town and joined 
the late revelers. Don Guillermo, rising before 
dawn, and walking up and down the corridor 
to conquer the pangs of Dona Trinidad's dulces, 
noticed that the door of his son's room was ajar. 
He paused before it and heard slow, regular, 
patient sobs. He opened the door and went 
in. Prudencia, alone, curled up in a far corner 
of her bed, the clothes over her head, was 
bemoaning many things incidental to matrimony. 
As she heard the sound of heavy steps she gave 
a little shriek. 

" It is I, Prudencia, " said her un cle. ' ' Where 
is Reinaldo? " 

'* I — do — not — know." 

" Did he not come from the ball-room with 
thee ? " 

"N-o-o-o-o." 

" Dost thou know where he has gone ? " 

'*N-o-o-o, sefior." 

"Art thou afraid?" 


 

''Ky I God— of— my— life ! " 

" Never mind, " said the old gentleman. " Go 
to sleep. Thy uncle will protect thee, and 
this will not happen again." 

He seated himself by the bedside. Pruden- 
cia's sobs ceased gradually, and she fell asleep. 
An hour later the door opened softly, andRein- 
aldo entered. In spite of the mescal in him, his 
knees shook as he saw the indulgent but stern 
arbiter of the Iturbi y Moncada destinies sitting 
in judgment at the bedside of his wife. 

" Where have you been, sir ? " 

" To take a walk, — to see to 

" No lying! It makes no difference where 
you have been. What I want to know is this : 
Is it your duty to gallivant about town ? or is 
your place at this hour beside your wife ? " 

" Here, senor." 

The old man rose, and, seizing the bride- 
groom by the shoulders, shook him until his 
teeth clattered together. "Then see that you 
stay here with her hereafter, or you shall no 
longer be a married man." And he stamped 
out and slammed the door behind him.

We spent the next day at the race-field. Many 
of the caballeros had brought their finest horses, 
and Reinaldo's were famous. The vaqueros 
threw off their black glazed sombreros and 
black velvet jackets, wearing only the short 
black trousers laced with silver, a shirt of 
dazzling whiteness, a silk handkerchief twisted 
about the head, and huge spurs on their bare 
brown heels. Some of us stood on a platform, 
others remained on their horses ; all were wild 
with excitement and screamed themselves 
hoarse. The great dark eyes of the girls flashed, 
their red mouths trembled with the flood of eager
