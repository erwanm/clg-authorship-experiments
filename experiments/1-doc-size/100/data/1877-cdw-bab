cultivating rheumatism and acquiring invaluable knowledge of the most
fickle weather known in a region which has all the fascination and all
the power of being disagreeable belonging to the most accomplished
coquette in the world.

The rural life described is that of New England between 1830 and 1850,
in a period of darkness, before the use of lucifer matches; but when,
although religion had a touch of gloom and all pleasure was heightened
by a timorous apprehension that it was sin, the sun shone, the woods
were full of pungent scents, nature was strong in its invitations to
cheerfulness, and girls were as sweet and winsome as they are in the
old ballads.

The object of the papers composing the volume—hough "object" is a
strong word to use about their waywardness—twas to recall scenes in
the boy-life of New England, or the impressions that a boy had of that
life. There was no attempt at the biography of any particular boy; the
experiences given were common to the boyhood of the time and place.
While the book, therefore, was not consciously biographical, it was of
necessity written out of a personal knowledge. And I may be permitted
to say that, as soon as I became conscious that I was dealing with a
young life of the past, I tried to be faithful to it, strictly so, and
to import into it nothing of later experience, either in feeling or
performance. I invented nothing,—not an adventure, not a scene, not
an emotion. I know from observation how difficult it is for an adult
to write about childhood. Invention is apt to supply details that
memory does not carry. The knowledge of the man insensibly inflates the
boyhood limitations. The temptation is to make a psychological analysis
of the boy's life and aspirations, and to interpret them according to
the man's view of life. It seems comparatively easy to write stories
about boys, and even biographies; but it is not easy to resist the
temptation of inventing scenes to make them interesting, indulging in
exaggerations both of adventure and of feeling which are not true to
experience, inventing details impossible to be recalled by the best
memory, and states of mind which are psychologically untrue to the
boy's consciousness.

How far I succeeded in keeping the man out of the boy's life, my
readers can judge better than the writer. The volume originally made
no sensation—how could it, pitched in such a key?—but it has gone
on peacefully, and, I am glad to acknowledge, has made many valuable
friends. It started a brook, and a brook it has continued. In sending
out this new edition with Mr. Clifton Johnson's pictures, lovingly
taken from the real life and heart of New England, I may express the
hope that the boy of the remote generation will lose no friends.

BEING A BOY


One of the best things in the world to be is a boy; it requires no
experience, though it needs some practice to be a good one. The
disadvantage of the position is that it does not last long enough;
it is soon over; just as you get used to being a boy, you have to be
something else, with a good deal more work to do and not half so much
fun. And yet every boy is anxious to be a man, and is very uneasy with
the restrictions that are put upon him as a boy. Good fun as it is to
yoke up the calves and play work, there is not a boy on a farm but
would rather drive a yoke of oxen at real work. What a glorious feeling
it is, indeed, when a boy is for the first time given the long whip and
permitted to drive the oxen, walking by their side, swinging the long
lash, and shouting "Gee, Buck!" "Haw, Golden!" "Whoa, Bright!" and all
the rest of that remarkable language, until he is red in the face, and
all the neighbors for half a mile are aware that something unusual is
going on. If I were a boy, I am not sure but I would rather drive the
oxen than have a birthday.



The proudest day of my life was one day when I rode on the neap of
the cart, and drove the oxen, all alone, with a load of apples to the
cider-mill. I was so little, that it was a wonder that I didn't fall
off, and get under the broad wheels. Nothing could make a boy, who
cared anything for his appearance, feel flatter than to be run over
by the broad tire of a cart-wheel. But I never heard of one who was,
and I don't believe one ever will be. As I said, it was a great day
for me, but I don't remember that the oxen cared much about it. They
sagged along in their great clumsy way, switching their tails in my
face occasionally, and now and then giving a lurch to this or that
side of the road, attracted by a choice tuft of grass. And then I
"came the Julius Cæsar" over them, if you will allow me to use such a
slang expression, a liberty I never should permit you. I don't know
that Julius Cæsar ever drove cattle, though he must often have seen the
peasants from the Campagna "haw" and "gee" them round the Forum (of
course in Latin, a language that those cattle understood as well as
ours do English); but what I mean is, that I stood up and "hollered"
with all my might, as everybody does with oxen, as if they were born
deaf, and whacked them with the long lash over the head, just as the
big folks did when they drove. I think now that it was a cowardly thing
to crack the patient old fellows over the face and eyes, and make them
wink in their meek manner. If I am ever a boy again on a farm, I shall
speak gently to the oxen, and not go screaming round the farm like a
crazy man; and I shall not hit them a cruel cut with the lash every few
minutes, because it looks big to do so and I cannot think of anything
else to do. I never liked lickings myself, and I don't know why an
ox should like them, especially as he cannot reason about the moral
