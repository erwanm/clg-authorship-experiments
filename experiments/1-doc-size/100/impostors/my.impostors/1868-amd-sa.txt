genial mood ; anc though the subjects might not have been 
wise or profound, we went over them very agreeably. 

Later in the evening he asked me for some music. Mrs. 
Lawrence had listened to my playing and singing with due 
regard for what it would do for me in society. But it was 
a passion with me, and when I found that I could kindle 
another soul, it gave me a sudden inspiration. I saw his 
eyes dilate with pleasure, and a fitful color wandered over 
his face. How strangely those pathetic old ballads stir 
one's heart I love, sweet for all its pain, tempting in 
spite of thorny ways ; men and women content at having 
drained the cup of Miss, and asking no more of life. Had 
we fallen upon more material days and desires? 

I felt glad and happy that night why, I could not tell. 
When Mr. Graham )cft us the next morning, it seemed as 
if some brightness had gone out of the place. 

I stood on the balcony, gathering up stray threads of 
memory, when Mr. St. John approached, having been to 
the gates with his guest. 

"Yon deserve to be congratulated," he said; and 
although I understood the tone, I returned, simply, 

"For what?" 

" Upon your conquest. But to save a broken heart, I 
will tell yon that Mr. Graham is engaged to his cousin a 
kind of convenient family arrangement, I believe, she being 
an heiress." 

" I do not think that fact would weigh a particle with 
Mr. Graham," I said as earnestly as I felt. 
" O, yon have unlimited faith." 

"And yonrwarning was altogether unnecessary," I re- 
torted, scornfully. 

"It was merely pastime upon both sides, then ! "Well, 
yon acquitted yourself admirably. You will not have much 
to learn at Newport." 



 

tt I believe I did only what common courtesy required," 
I said, haughtily. 

"A woman's excuse for trifling." 

" It is well there are some whose fine perception enables 
them to distinguish between ordinary politeness and the 
gratification of a foolish vanity. While there are such 
cool, clear-eyed people in the world, we need not fear for 
society." 

"Undoubtedly;" and his voice was irritatingly sweet. 
" Neither may we apprehend any Quixotic reform when 
the prophets of the new faith are diverted by a word or a 
look from some fanciful sentimentalist." 

If I could have annihilated him with a glance, I should 
have done so : and he looking calm and handsome, w r ith 
that bafHing smile playing about his face. 

"You ridicule my high aims, and if I find any satis- 
faction in ordinary pleasures, you sneer. What is your 
ideal?" 

"And you are a fiery radical," he said, ignoring my 
question. " I wonder " a little lower, as if he was think- 
ing to himself "if you mean to play with hearts in that 
fashion ? " 

" Will it do any harm ? Are men so sensitive and deli- 
cate?" 

" O, no," he said, dryly. " It may go hard with some 
of them at first, but they soon get used to the wjyrfare. It 
does damage faith a little, but those old-fashiolrcd virtues 
are at a discount in modern life." 

" I think you wrong us all," I said, more hurt than I 
cared to show. " If we wound any one, it is because we 
have first been pained ourselves." 

Mrs. Lawrence crossed the hall, and I took shelter under 
her kindly wing. She put her slender white hand over 
my shoulder, and presently we walked away together. 


" "Whnt was Stuart saying? " she asked ; but I could see
