a romp with Robin and Marjorie. During the most trying 
hours General Mackenzie remained with his son, who 
bore his suffering with much patience and fortitude, and a 
courage that fascinated Kathie. It did seem at times as 
if he could easily let himself drop out of life. 

Kathie spoke of this one day to the doctor. " Well, 
why should he want to die ? " asked the doctor a little 
gruffly. u Seems to me you young peopl nowadays 
make a great mistake about this dying business. God 
puts you into the world to live, and to make a fight for it. 
It is the survival of the fittest, after all ; but your work is 
to make yourself fit to survive, fit, even, for some other 
life, some other world. It looks cowardly to me to give 
up at the first hard blow, to want to get out of the puin 
and suffering to ease, and call that resignation. What 
does your old apostle say? 'Having done all things, to 
stand.' Not to cry to be taken out of the world when 
you haven't done more than half the things. There 's 
too much weakness, too much irresponsibility, too much 
fear about using one's will. They talk a lot of stuff down 
there at Ada's ; but there is strength and substance in it, 
after all. They go back to the seekers in the dark, igno- 
rant ages, when the little knots of philosophy lighted a few 
feet from the centre, when the strong, earnest, pure-minded 
men interpreted the secrets of nature, and came so near 
to the other grand secret. We have been losing them 
both, throwing out the ballast and calling on a curious, 
soft, sweet mysticism to save us, and when the mysticism 
has failed, cry out that there is no salvation. It is a grand 
old fight, and it is sheer indolence to be swept out of it. 
So my hero," with a little twinkle in his eye, " is making 
the fight for life, quite confident God wants him to live 
until he sends the other message. He has his father and 





your sweet aunt, and a work to do when he gets about it 
again ; and he is going to get about it, though it may not 
be soldiering in the future. But," and Dr. Markham's 
voice fell to a reverent tone, "if he was called, I think we 
should all see how a hero could die." 

The tears stood in Kathie's eyes. 

"You know, my child," he continued, " it is not always 
the great deeds that make a hero. The fine, pure, whole- 
some, every-day living has something in it as well. We 
can squander that, but extravagance of vital or spiritual 
forces is not courage, but waste. I go over these things a 
good deal now, and wonder why we are so willing to throw 
away the best of our lives instead of living them out in a 
true and honest fashion, or moaning that the days have 
no pleasure in them. It is our rightful business to find 
the pleasure." 

Dr. Markham was correct about his patient. There 
were several days when the balance almost trembled, when 
there were fears of various kinds, but they proved fears only. 
The abscess had not touched a vital part, and it was 
nature's way of casting out useless matter. Hy Christmas 
the young hero was out of danger and on the high road to 
recovery. He would be weak and perhaps a little lame at 
first, but there was no permanent injury to the joint. 

It would be a glad, joyful Christmas. Where to keep 
the feast was the next consideration 

Mrs. Mackenzie wanted them all to come to the city, 
and not be divided, since Cedarwood must be shorn of 
some of its members. Mr. and Mrs. Langdon were down 
for a month or two, so the holiday in the city was most 
promising. 

Rob had kept his word to his mother steadfastly. The 
alternate Sundays had been hers alone. No restless roam- 
ing around for companionship, no outward show, at least, 
of the days being long. They were, sometimes, in spite of 
his best efforts. He missed the stir and interest of the 





every-day life. He went to church with his mother and 
his uncle, he played with or oftener teased the baby, who 
was a source of amusement. Mrs. Alston had come to 
love it devotedly. For a long while Bertha had been rather 
shy of her grandmother, as if in some way she understood 
the want of perfect accord, but both had outgrown that. 
Mr. Conover had made known to her his intention of ulti- 
mately adopting the child. 

"We shall need something when Kathie goes," he said 
gravely. " Bertha will keep us from growing old too fast." 

Kathie was a most important personage in the Macken- 
zie household during this time. She lifted half the burden
