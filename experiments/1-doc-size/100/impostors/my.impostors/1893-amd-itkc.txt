that some one might pick out the clean and decent 
people, and give them a chance. It is just what 
you are doing, I know ; but there are so many 
of them ! And somehow, thinking it all over, I 
seemed to go wrong myself, as if I couldn't stay 
and enjoy the love and delight and happiness 
when I had no real share in it." 

She broke down then in passionate sobbing. 
Pearl Disbrowe soothed, comforted, brought the 
starved, longing, fettered soul out to the highway 
of hope and trust, paths in which it had never 
walked before. But not all at once would the 
grim phantoms of the past be banished. 

When she came down among them again, shyly 
and with great humility, they all strove to add to 



k 





her comfort with the sweet grace of a higher 
understanding of her needs. Not with any offi- 
cious patronizing; that was not Pearl's way. Miss 
Eastwood was curiously interested. Something 
in the fine, passionate responsiveness of the girl, 
when she really allowed any influence to sway her, 
moved the elder profoundly. Suggestions of pos- 
sibilities flashing out that one could not help 
wondering at. 

She could understand that a girl like Stacy 
Delamater might be worth helping to something 
higher. Was there anything Stacy really desired.? 
She had never thought of that before. But this 
waif of a region so near the slums, with no parents 
one could respect, even if poverty was not taken 
into account, would she be worth raising to those 
heights outlined by education, and would she step 
upward to a finer atmosphere ? Her training had 
been to let these people alone, except as you 
placed money in the hands of committees and 
associations who could sift and winnow rigorously. 

To be sure, there was the whole summer before 
them, and one could tell better presently what 
efforts the girl would be worth. That Pearl meant 
to do something for her advancement she under- 
stood, — Pearl, with her small income and wisely 
generous heart. Why should not she ? Yet she 
could not take her into her own life. There were 
schools and other methods. 





Her talk with Mr. Olmstead had nearly decided 
her. She watched Rhea narrowly. Yes, there 
was an innate grace about the girl, a certain adap- 
tiveness, a quick brain that caught at usages, that 
kept her from awkwardness even when she was 
abrupt. She would always be lame; but there 
was a touch of the unusual in her face that lifted 
her above any common prettiness. The large, 
dark eyes that could meet you with wistfulness, 
and yet turn cold and irresponsive ; the small, 
fine features that might be haughty under society 
training ; the olive skin that might be made to 
bloom with a touch of roses. Yes, she would be 
piquant. And if she evinced some genius ! Now- 
adays, to have some peculiar gift above mediocrity 
was a passport to the world's approbation. She, 
Sabrina, cared little for it. It had been offered 
to her so readily. It was a tribute generally paid 
to wealth, and beauty sufficient to distinguish one. 

Yes, she could supplement Pearl's endeavor. 
She put it that way, but she intended the real ex- 
pense should be hers. They would take counsel 
together. Whatever was best for Rhea Vasilis — 

Pearl had to go in to Brentford. Sabrina played 
a while, soft, low chords, improvising, as she often 
did when she was moved by any new or strange 
feeling. Then some visitors came — the agent of 
the syndicate, to bespeak an option on Chester 





Farm, if Miss Eastwood felt disposed to sell. 
And Aunt Vantine had written " to her ungrate- 
ful girl " that her guardian had disposed of some
