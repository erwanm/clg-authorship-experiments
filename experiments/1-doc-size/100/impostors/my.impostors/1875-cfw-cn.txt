of old associations whose sadness time had mercifully 
softened. The summer was over; September had be- 
gun, but there came to me a great wish to see Mack- 
inac once more; to look again upon the little white 
fort where I had lived with Archie, my soldier nephew, 
killed at Shiloh. The steamer took me safely across 
Erie, up the brimming Detroit Kiver, through the en- 
chanted region of the St. Glair flats, and out into broad 
Lake Huron ; there, off Thunder Bay, a gale met us, 
and for hours we swayed between life and death. The 
season for pleasure travelling was over; my fellow- 
passengers, with one exception, were of that class of 
Americans who, dressed in cheap imitations of fine 
clothes, are forever travelling, travelling, taking the 
steamers not from preference, but because they are less 
costly than an all-rail route. The thin, listless men, in 
ill-fitting black clothes and shining tall hats, sat on the 
deck in tilted chairs, hour after hour, silent and dreary ; 
the thin, listless women, clad in raiment of many col- 
ors, remained upon the fixed sofas in the cabin hour 
after hour, silent and weary. At meals they ate indis- 
criminately everything within range, but continued the 
same, a weary, dreary, silent band. The one exception 
was an old man, tall and majestic, with silvery hair 
and bright, dark eyes, dressed in the garb of a Eoman 
Catholic priest, albeit slightly tinged with frontier 
innovations. He came on board at Detroit, and as 



 

soon as we were under way he exchanged his hat for 
a cloth cap embroidered with Indian bead- work; and 
when the cold air, precursor of the gale, struck us on 
Huron, he wrapped himself in a large capote made of 
skins, with the fur inward. 

In times of danger formality drops from us. During 
those long hours, when the next moment might have 
brought death, this old man and I were together ; and 
when at last the cold dawn came, and the disabled 
steamer slowly ploughed through the angry water 
around the point, and showed us Mackinac in the 
distance, we discovered that the island was a mutual 
friend, and that we knew each other, at least by name ; 
for the silver-haired priest was Father Piret, the hermit 
of the Chenaux. In the old days, when I was living 
at the little white fort, I had known Father Piret by 
reputation, and he had heard of me from the French 
half-breeds around the point. We landed. The sum- 
mer hotels were closed, and I was directed to the old 
Agency, where occasionally a boarder was received by 
x the family then in possession. The air was chilly, and 
a fine rain was falling, the afterpiece of the equinoctial ; 
the wet storm-flag hung heavily down over the fort on 
the height, and the waves came in sullenly. All was 
in sad accordance with my feelings as I thought of the 
past and its dead, while the slow tears of age moistened 
my eyes. But the next morning Mackinac awoke, 
robed in autumn splendor ; the sunshine poured down, 



 

the straits sparkled back, the forest glowed in scarlet, 
the larches waved their wild, green hands, the fair- 
weather flag floated over the little fort, and all was as 
joyous as though no one had ever died ; and indeed it 
is in glorious days like these that we best realize 
immortality. 

I wandered abroad through the gay forest to the 
Arch, the Lovers' Leap, and old Fort Holmes, whose 
British walls had been battered down for pastime, 
so that only a caved-in British cellar remained to 
mark the spot, Eeturning to the Agency, I learned 
that Father Piret had called to see me. 

" I am soiTy that I missed him," I said j " he is a 
remarkable old man." 

The circle at the dinner-table glanced up with one 
accord. The little Methodist minister with the sur- 
prised eyes looked at me more surprised than ever; 
his large wife groaned audibly. The Baptist colporteur 
peppered his potatoes until they and the plate were 
black ; the Presbyterian doctor, who was the champion 
of the Protestant party on the island, wished to know 
if I was acquainted with the latest devices of the Scar- 
let Woman in relation to the county school-fund. 

" But, my friends," I replied, " Father Piret and I
