 



CHAPTER XV. 

The interior of the temple was lighted with innum- 
erable lamps, suspended from the ceiling, of bronze 
and of the simplest workmanship, like everything 
which pertained to the worship of Auramazda. In 
the midst, upon a small altar of black stone, stood a 
bronze brazier, shaped like a goblet, wherein a small 
fire of wood burned quietly, sending up little wreaths 
of smoke, which spread over the flat ceiling and hung 
like a mist about the lamps ; before the altar lay a 
supply of fuel â€” fine, evenly-cut sticks of white pine- 
wood, piled in regular order in a symmetrical heap. 
At one extremity of the oblong hall stood a huge 
mortar of black marble, having a heavy wooden pestle, 
and standing upon a circular base, in which was cut 
a channel all around, with an opening in the front from 
which the Haoma juice poured out abundantly when 
the fresh milkweed was moistened and pounded to- 
gether in the mortar. A square receptacle of marble 
received the fluid, which remained until it had fer- 
mented during several days, and had acquired the 
intoxicating strength for which it was prized, and to 
which it owed its sacred character. By the side of 
this vessel, upon a low marble table, lay a huge 
wooden ladle ; and two golden cups, short and wide, 
but made smaller in the middle like a sand-glass, stood 
there also. 



 

At the opposite end of the temple, before a marble 
screen which shielded the doorway, was placed a great 
carved chair of ebony and gold and silver, raised upon 
a step above the level of the floor. 

It was already dark when the king entered the 
temple, dressed in his robes of state, with his sword 
by his side, his long sceptre tipped with the royal 
sphere in his right hand, and the many-pointed crown 
upon his head. His heavy black beard had grown 
longer in the three years that had passed, and flowed 
down over his vest of purple and white halfway to 
his belt. His face was stern, and the deep lines of 
his strong features had grown more massive in out- 
line. With the pride of every successive triumph 
had come also something more of repose and con- 
scious power. His step was slower, and his broad 
brown hand grasped the golden sceptre with less of 
nervous energy and more unrelenting force. But his 
brows were bent, and his expression, as he took his 
seat before the screen, over against the altar of the 
fire, was that of a man who was prepared to be dis- 
contented and cared little to conceal what he felt. 

After him came the chief priest, completely robed 
in white, with a thick, white linen sash rolled for a 
girdle about his waist, the fringed ends hanging stiffly 
down upon one side. Upon his head he wore a great 
mitre, also of white linen, and a broad fringed stole 
of the same material fell in two wide bands from each 
side of his neck to his feet. His beard was black and 
glossy, fine as silk, and reached almost to his waist. 
He came and stood with his back to the king and his 
face to the altar, ten paces from the second fire. 



 

Then, from behind the screen and from each side of 
it, the other priests filed out, two and two, all clad in 
white like the chief priest, save that their mitres were 
smaller and they wore no stole. They came out and 
ranged themselves around the walls of the temple, 
threescore and nine men, of holy order, trained in 
the ancient chanting of the Mazdayashnian hymns; 
men in the prime and strength of life, black-bearded 
and broad-shouldered, whose massive brows and 
straight features indicated noble powers of mind 
and body. 

The two who stood nearest to the chief priest came 
forward, and taking from his hands a square linen 
cloth he bore, bound it across his mouth and tied it 
behind his neck in a firm knot by means of strings. 
Then, one of them put into his left hand a fan of 
eagles' feathers, and the other gave him a pair of 
wrought-iron pincers. Then they left him to advance 
alone to the altar. 

He went forward till he was close to the bronze 
brazier, and stooping down, he took from the heap of 
fuel a clean white stick, with the pincers, which he
