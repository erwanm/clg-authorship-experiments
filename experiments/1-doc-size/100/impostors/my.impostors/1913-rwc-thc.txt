over all bounds to the barriers of impertinence.

There was, as usual, a respectable company gathered at Croghan's that
afternoon; and a floating-island and tea and a punch. Lois, in her
usual corner by the northern window, was so beset and surrounded by
officers of ours, and Schott's, Franklin's, and Spalding's, and
staff-officers halted for the day, that I had quite despaired of a word
with her for the present; and had somewhat sulkily seated myself on the
stairs to bide my time. What between love, jealousy, and hurt pride
that she had not instantly left her irksome poppinjays at the mere
sight of me, and flown to me under the noses of them all, I was in two
minds whether I would remain in the house or no--so absurd and horridly
unbalanced is a young man's mind when love begins meddling with and
readjusting its accustomed mechanism. Long, long were my ears in those
first days of my heart's undoing!

Solemnly brooding on woman's coldness, fickleness, and general
ingratitude, and silently hating every gallant who crowded about her to
hold her cup, her fan, her plate, pick up her handkerchief or a bud
fallen from her corsage, I could not, however, for the life of me keep
my eyes from the cold-blooded little jilt.

She had evidently been out walking before I arrived, for she still wore
her coquette garden-hat--the chipstraw affair, with the lilac ribbons
tied in a bow under her rounded chin; and a white, thin gown, most
ravishing, and all bestrewn with sprigs and posies, which displayed her
smooth and delicately moulded throat above the low-pinned kerchief, and
her lovely arms from the creamy elbow lace down to her finger tips.

The French hair-powder she wore was not sprinkled in any vulgar
profusion; it merely frosted the rich curls, making her pink checks
pinker and her grey eyes a darker and purpler grey, and rendering her
lips fresh and dewy in vivid contrast. And she wore a patch on her
smooth left cheek-bone. And it was a most deadly thing to do, causing
me a sentimental anguish unspeakable.

As I sat there worshipping, enchanted, resentful, martyred, alternately
aching with loneliness and devotion, and at the same time heartily
detesting every man on whom she chanced to smile, comes a sly and
fragrant breath in my ear. And, turning, I discover Lana perched on a
step of the stairs above me, her mocking eyes brilliant with unkind
delight.

"Poor swain a-sighing!" said she. "Love is sure a thorny way, Euan."

"Have a care for your own skirts then," said I ungraciously.

"My skirts!"

"Yours, Lanette. Your petticoat needs mending now."

"If love no more than rend my petticoat I ought to be content," she
said coolly.

Silenced by her effrontery, which truly passed all bounds, I merely
glared at her, and presently she laughed outright.

"Broad-brim," said she, "I was not born yesterday. Have no worries
concerning me, but look to yourself, for I think you have been sorely
hit at last. And God knows such wounds go hard with a truly worthy and
good young man."

"I make nothing of your nonsense," said I coldly.

"What? Nothing? And yonder sits its pretty and romantic inspiration? I
am glad I have lived to see the maid who dealt you your first wound!"

"Do you fancy that I am in love?" said I defiantly.

"Why not admit what your lop-ears and moony mien yell aloud to the
world entire?"

"Have you no common sense, Lana? Do you imagine a man can fall in love
in a brief week?"

"I have been wondering," said she coolly, "whether you have ever before
seen her."

"Continue to wonder," said I bluntly.

"I do.... Because you call her 'Lois' so readily--and you came near it
the first day you had apparently set eyes on her. Also, she calls you
'Euan' with a tripping lack of hesitation--even with a certain natural
tenderness--"

I turned on her, exasperated:

"Come," said I, controlling my temper with difficulty, "I am tired of
playing butt to your silly arrows."

"Oh, how you squirm, Euan! Cupid and I are shooting you full as a
porcupine!"

"If Cupid is truly shooting," said I with malice, "you had best hunt
cover, Lana. For I think already a spent shaft or two has bruised you,
flying at hazard from his bow."

She smilingly ignored what I had said.

"Tell me," she persisted, "are you not at her pretty feet already? Is
