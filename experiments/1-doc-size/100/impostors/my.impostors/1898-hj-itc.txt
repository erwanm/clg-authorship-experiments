She felt she scarce knew what as if she 
might soon be pounced upon for some lurid 
connection with a scandal. It was the 
queerest of all sensations, for she had heard, 
she had read, of these things and the wealth 
of her intimacy with them at Cocker 's might 
be supposed to have schooled and seasoned 
her. This particular one that she had really 
quite lived with was, after all, an old story ; 
yet what it had been before was dim and 
distant beside the touch under which she 
now winced. Scandal? it had never been 
but a silly word. Now it was a great palpa 
ble surface, and the surface was somehow, 
Captain Everhard 's wonderful face. Deep 
down in his eyes was a picture, the vision of 
a great place like a chamber of justice, 
where, before a watching crowd, a poor girl, 
exposed but heroic, swore with a quavering 





voice to a document, proved an alibi, sup 
plied a link. In this picture she bravely 
took her place. It was the 23rd. 

Then can't you get it this morning or 
some time to-day? 

She considered, still holding him with her 
look, which she then turned on her two 
companions, who were by this time unre 
servedly enlisted. She didn' t care not a 
scrap, and she glanced about for a piece of 
paper. With this she had to recognize the 
rigour of official thrift a morsel of black 
ened blotter was the only loose paper to be 
seen. Have you got a card? she said to 
her visitor. He was quite away from Pad- 
dington now, and the next instant, with a 
pocket-pook in his hand, he had whipped a 
card out. She gave no glance at the name 
on it only turned it to the other side. She 
continued to hold him, she felt at present, as 
she had never held him ; and her command 
of her colleagues was, for the moment, not 
less marked. She wrote something on the 
back of the card and pushed it across to him.

He fairly glared at it. Seven, nine, 
four 

Nine, six, one she obligingly completed 
the number. Is it right? she smiled. 

He took the whole thing in with a flushed 
intensity; then there broke out in him a 
visibility of relief that was simply a tremen 
dous exposure. He shone at them all like 
a tall lighthouse, embracing even, for sym 
pathy, the blinking young man. By all the 
powers it 's wrong! And without another 
look, without a word of thanks, without 
time for anything or anybody, he turned on 
them the broad back of his great stature, 
straightened his triumphant shoulders and 
strode out of the place. 

She was left confronted with her habitual 
critics. "If it 's wrong it 's all right!" she 
extravagantly quoted to them. 

The counter-clerk was really awe-stricken. 
But how did you know, dear? 

I remembered, love! 

Mr. Buckton, on the contrary, was rude. 
And what game is that, Miss? 





No happiness she had ever known came 
within miles of it, and some minutes elapsed 
before she could recall herself sufficiently 
to reply that it was none of his business.

If life at Cocker 's with the dreadful drop
