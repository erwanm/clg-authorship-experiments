when the pretorians called upon him 
to rule the world; and at the time an 
ingenuous Ind, one who blushed like 
Lalage, very readily, particularly at 
the title of Father of the Country, 
which the senate was anxious to give 
him ; endowed with excellent instincts, 
which he had got no one knew whence; 
a trifle petit titattre, perhaps, perfuming the soles of his feet, and careful 
about the arrangement of his yellow 
curls, but withal generous, modest, 
sympathetic — in short, a flower in a 
cesspool, a youth not over well-fitted 
to reign. But his mother was there; 
as he developed so did his fear of her, 
to such proportions even that he gave 
certain orders, and his mother was 
killed. That duel between mother 
and son, terrible in its intensity and 
unnameable horror, even the Borgias 
could not surpass. Tacitus has told 
it, dramatically, as was his wont. 


 



he told it in Latin, in which tongue 
it had best remain. 

At that time the ingenuous lad had 
disappeared. The cub was full-grown. 
Besides, he had tasted blood. Octa- 
via, the slender maiden, who with her 
brother, Britannicus, and her sister, 
Antonia, had been his playmates; who 
was almost his own sister; whose earliest memories interhnked with his, 
and who had become his wife, had 
been put to death; not that she had 
failed to please, but because a lady, 
Sabina Poppcea, who, Tacitus says, 
lacked nothing except virtue, had declined to be his mistress. At the 
time Sabina was married. But 
divorce was easy. Sabina got one at 
the bar; Nero with the axe. The 
twain were then united. Nero seems 
to have loved her greatlj-, a fact, as 
Suetonius puts it, which did not pre- 
vent him from kicking her to death. 



 



Already he had poisoned Britannicus, 
and with Octavia decapitated and 
Agrippina gone, of the imperial house 
there remained but Antonia and him- 
self. The latter he invited to marry 
him; she declined. He invited her to 
die. He was then alone, the last of 
his race. Monsters never engender. 
A thinker who passed that way 
thought him right to have killed his 
mother; her crime was in giving him 
birth. 

Therewith he was popular; more 
so even than Caligula, who was a poet, 
and as such apart from the crowd, 
while Nero was frankly canaille —  well- 
meaning at that — which Caligula 
never was. During .the early years 
of his reign he could not do good 
enough. The gladiators were not 
permitted to die; he would have no , 
shedding of blood; the smell of it was  
distasteful. He would listen to no 



 

denunciations ; when a decree of death 
was brought to him to sign, he re- 
gretted that he knew how to write. 
Rome had never seen a gentler prince, 
nor yet one more splendidly lavish. 
The people had not only the necessities 
of life, but the luxuries, the superfluities, too. For days and days in the 
Forum there was an incessant shower 
of tickets that were exchangeable, not 
for bread or trivial sums, but for gems, 
pictures, slaves, fortunes, ships, villas
