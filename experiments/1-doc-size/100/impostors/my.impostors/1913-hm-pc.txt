to go down to his room.  With the dull obstinacy of a drunken man, he
refused to stir; he was perfectly satisfied to stay where he was.  The
three brown men stood irresolutely and helplessly around the man.
Every one had gone below.  The hose was ready to flush the deck.  It
did not matter; he, Craig, would not budge.

"Leave me alone, you black beggars!"

"But, Sahib," began one of the Lascars, who spoke English.

"Don't talk to me.  I tell you, get out!" striking at their feet with
his swollen hands.

Warrington, who had not lain down at all, but who had wandered about
the free decks like some lost soul from The Flying Dutchman,
Warrington, hearing voices, came out of the smoke-room.  A glance was
sufficient.  A devil's humor took possession of him.  He walked over.

"Get up," he said quietly.

Craig blinked up at him from out of puffed eyes.  "Go to the devil!
Fine specimen to order me about."

"Will you get up peacefully?  These men have work to do."

Craig was blind to his danger.  "What's that to me?  Go away, all of
you, to the devil, for all I care.  I'll get up when I get damn good
and ready.  Not before."

Warrington picked up the hose.

"Sahib!" cried the Lascar in protest.

"Be still!" ordered Warrington.  "Craig, for the last time, will you
get up?"

"No!"

Warrington turned the key, and a deluge of cold salt-water struck Craig
full in the chest.  He tried to sit up, but was knocked flat.  Then he
rolled over on the deck, choking and sputtering.  He crawled on his
hands and knees until he reached the chair-rail, which he clutched
desperately, drawing himself up.  The pitiless stream never swerved.
It smacked against the flat of his back like the impact of a hand.

"For God's sake stop it!" cried Craig, half strangled.

"Will you go below?"

"Yes, yes!  Turn it away!" sober enough by now.

Warrington switched off the key, his face humorless, though there was a
sparkle of grim humor in his sleep-hungry eyes.  Craig leaned against
the deck-house, shaking and panting.

"I would I could get at your soul as easily."  Warrington threw aside
the hose, and the Lascars sprang upon it, not knowing what the big
blond Sahib might do next.

Craig turned, venom on his tongue.  He spoke a phrase.  In an instant,
cold with fury, Warrington had him by the throat.

"You low base cur!" he said, shaking the man until he resembled a
manikin on wires.  "Had you been sober last night, I'd have thrown you
into the sea.  Honorless dog!  You wrote to Miss Chetwood.  You
insulted her, too.  If you wish to die, speak to her again."

Craig struggled fiercely to free himself.  He wasn't sure, by the look
of the other man's eyes, that he wasn't going to be killed then and
there.  There was something cave-mannish and cruel in the way
Warrington worried the man, shaking him from side to side and forcing
him along the deck.  Suddenly he released his hold, adding a buffet on
the side of the head that sent Craig reeling and sobbing into the
companionway.

"Here, I say, what's the row?"

Warrington looked over his shoulder.  The call had come from the first
officer.

"A case of drunkenness," coolly.

"But I say, we can't have brawling on deck, sir.  You ought to know
that.  If the man's conduct was out of order, you should have brought
your complaint before the captain or me.  We really can't have any
rowing, sir."

Warrington replied gravely: "Expediency was quite necessary."

"What's this?"  The officer espied the soaked bedding.  "Who turned the
hose here?"

"I did," answered Warrington.

"I shall have to report that to the captain, sir.  It's against the
rules aboard this steamship for passengers to touch anything of that
sort."  The officer turned and began violently to abuse the bewildered
Lascars.

"I shouldn't bullyrag them, sir," interposed Warrington.  "They
