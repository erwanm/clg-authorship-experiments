self-scorn. For there are three tidal waves on the 
ocean of widowhood. If the first is loneliness and 
the second despairing doubt, the third is disloyalty 
to the dead. 

Carolyn felt that she was in the breakers of her 
 

own being. She called upon her husband's name 
and memory as she would have called upon the 
power of God if she had been a drowning woman. 

"Chanceford! Chanceford! Can't you help 
me?" 

The click of the front-door latch interrupted 
this prayer of the wife. When she looked, the 
office was empty. Clyde was fumbling in her neck 
with his cold nose, and her little boy — less keen 
of divination than the dog — stood calling for her 
in the hall. She heard the tired step of the lame 
doctor limping down the path. 

Sterling Hart was uneasy. Himself he would 
have flung to any fate for Cara's sake. He would 
have effaced himself from her life if that could 
have purchased her happiness. To give her joy he 
would have paid any price in personal suffering. 
His feeling was as simple as Christianity, whose 
other name is sacrifice. It could hardly be said 
that personal hope entered very much into his 
consciousness at this or any other time; although, 
perhaps, more at this than any other. But that he 
was distinctly uneasy he did not deny to himself. 
His cousin's acquaintance with the physician, her 
tenant, troubled him. 

Any persistent idea is a stream which 
everything tends to increase. Rivulets of impressions 

 

from one source or another ran into the preacher's 
prevailing anxiety for Carolyn. One September 
day he saw Mrs. Marriot driving a Salvation Army 
lassie to the train, and on the way home she over- 
took him, beckoning. 

" Is Mrs. Dane going to marry the new doctor?" 
she asked point-blank. "He is a brilliant 
fellow, and he saved my life. I am under 
obligations to him that one can never overlook ; and it 
is plainly not my business, Mr. Hart. But — " 

" But what ? " demanded the preacher. 

" I don't know," replied Douce Marriot. " That 's 
just it — I dorit know but what." 

In October Nannie Hops came on some trifling 
pretext to the preacher's house. The girl seemed 
troubled, and there was a tangle in her pretty 
brows. 

" Father returns the magazines," she began. 
" He thanks you, Mr. Hart. Mrs. Dane and I car- 
ried some to the Art School to show the pictures. 
Mr. Hart, there 's something I want to say to you. 
It is about Mrs. Dane." 

" Go on," said the preacher, for Nannie stopped. 

"If she should marry Dr. Royal — "faltered 
Nannie. "You know how much we think of Dr. 
Royal, don't you ? You won't take me the wrong 
way, will you ? I — why, I admire Dr. Royal ! " cried 
Nannie, vehemently. "But — " 

 

"But what?" asked Sterling Hart, as he had 
asked before. And, as before, the answer came : " I 
don't know — Mr. Hart, I don t know. There are 
things — " 

" What things ? " 

" I don't know how to explain myself. There 
seem to be reasons — " 

" What reasons ? " persisted the preacher. 

"That's just it," said Nannie. " If I could put 
my reasons so you could understand them, — but 
I can't do it. I don't know how to tell you why I 
feel the way I do." 

" I think you ought to be explicit," replied Cara's 
kinsman, frowning.
