expressionless.

"Where will you sit?" he asked. "It will take some time to tell you all
that he wishes me to say."

Cecilia led the way to the little sofa in the corner farthest from the
boudoir. It was there that Guido had asked her to be his wife, and it
was there that she had waited for him a few hours ago to tell him that
she could not marry him. She took her accustomed place, but Lamberti
drew forward a light chair and sat down facing her. He felt that he got
an advantage by the position, and that to a small extent it placed him
outside of her personal atmosphere. At such a moment he could not afford
to neglect the least circumstance which might help him. As for what he
should say, he had thought of many speeches while he was in the street,
but he did not remember any of them now, nor even that he had seemed to
hear himself speaking them.

"Why did you write that letter?" he asked, after a moment's pause.

Cecilia looked up quickly, surprised by the direct question, and then
gazed into his face in silence. She had confessed to herself that she
loved him, but she had not known how much, nor what it would mean to sit
so near him and hear him asking the question that had only one answer.
His eyes were steady and brave, when she looked at them, but not so hard
as she had expected. In earlier days she had always felt that they could
command her and even send her to sleep if he chose, but she did not feel
that now. The question had been asked suddenly and directly, but not
harshly. She did not answer it.

"Did Guido show you my letter?" she asked in a low voice.

But she was sure of the reply before it came.

"No. He told me that you broke off your engagement with him very
suddenly. I suppose you have done so because you think you do not care
for him enough to marry him, but he did not tell me so. Is that it?"

Cecilia nodded quickly, folded her hands nervously upon her knees, and
looked across the room.

"Yes," she said. "That is it. I do not love him."

"Yet you like him very much," Lamberti answered. "I have often seen you
together, and I am sure you do."

"I am very fond of him. If I had not been foolish, he might always have
been my best friend."

"I do not think you were foolish. You could hardly do better than marry
your best friend, I think. He is mine, and I know what his friendship is
worth. You will find out, as I have, that if he is sometimes indolent
and slow to make up his mind, he never changes afterwards. You may be
separated from him for a year or two, but you will find him always the
same when you meet him again, always gentle, always true, always the
most honourable of men."

"He is that, and more," Cecilia said softly. "I like everything about
him."

"And he loves you," Lamberti continued. "He loves you as men do not
often love the women they marry, and as you, with your fortune, may
never be loved again."

"I know it. I feel it. It makes it all the harder."

"But you thought you loved him, I am sure. You would not have accepted
him otherwise."

"Yes. Thank you for believing that much of me," Cecilia answered humbly.
"I thought I loved him."

"You sent for him this morning, because you had suddenly persuaded
yourself that you had made a great mistake. When you heard that he could
not come, you wrote the letter, and when it was written you sent it off
as fast as you could, for fear that you would not send it at all. Is
that true?"

"Yes. That is just what happened. How did you know?"

"Listen to me, please, for d'Este's sake. If you had not felt that you
were perhaps making another mistake, should you have been in such a
hurry to send the letter?"

Cecilia hesitated an instant.

"It was a hard thing to do. That is why I made haste to get it over. I
knew it would hurt him, but I thought it was wrong to deceive him for
even a few hours, after I had understood myself."

"It would have been kinder to wait until you could see him, and break it
gently to him. He was ill when he got your letter, and it made him
worse."

"How is he?" Cecilia asked quietly, a little ashamed of not having
enquired already. "It is nothing very serious, is it? Only a little
influenza, he said."

"He is not dangerously ill, but he had a good deal of fever this
afternoon. You will not see him for a week, I fancy. That is the reason
why I am here. I want you to postpone your decision, at least until he
