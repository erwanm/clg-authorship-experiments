the vestry room, there appeared a sex- 
ton, penetrated to the soul with the im- 
portance of every detail connected with 
the Establishment; and in his hands 
he bore two boxes, one of wood, and 
the other the identical tobacco-box of 
Irving's quest, — the same, yet different 


in the fresh glory of paint probably 
applied in 1861, for, as the inscription 
relates, it was then repaired anew. Now 
be it understood that there had been 
throughout little talk of the goblet, but 
much of this box from which the church- 
wardens once filled their innocent pipes. 
It was impossible to refer honestly to 
the former treasure in any way except 
as a memento of Mrs. Quicldy ; and 
would even the daring scion of an ag- 
gressive land approach a reverend in- 
cumbent of the English Church with a 
mention of that amiable but never con- 
ventional woman, painful antithesis to the 
British matron.? Perish the thought! 
Rather wait, hoping that box and goblet 
had drifted down the stream of years 
still together, and that the same incom- 
ing wave would sweep them to the trav- 
elers' feet. With a slow seriousness 
befitting the occasion the wooden box 
was opened, and there, in a green baize 
seclusion, lay the goblet of our dreams. 
The moment had come, and triumph- 
antly it crowned endeavor. No one who 
has seen that cup can doubt for a mo- 
ment that it certainly is the one illu- 
minated by the sea-coal fire that day 
 

when Falstaf swore his perishable oath. 
It is of a goodly shape, with a standard 
and a generous bowl. It is lined with 
gold, "parcel-gilt," and the silver exte- 
rior is decorated with fanciful little fig- 
ures in outline, shaped somewhat like 
Prince Rupert drops. About the foot 
runs the inscription, Ex dono Francisci 
Wythers Artnigeri, 

There is an actual possibility con- 
nected with this relic which is hardly to 
be considered without excitement. The 
cup, we are told, was in the first part of 
this century "very ' antyke.' " What is 
more probable than that William Shake- 
speare, in his social evenings at the tav- 
ern where it was kept, was a welcome 
guest of Saint Michael's vestry, what 
time the cup went round and beards 
wagged all } The parcel-gilt goblet was 
ever held in high esteem, whenever it 
was first received, and it is easy to be- 
lieve it formed a part of the church 
property before 1597, the earliest date 
to be assigned King Henry IV. That 
possibility once assumed, the mind runs 
riot in conjecture, and almost loses its 
balance in a mad chase after the thistle- 
down of circumstantial proof. Who was 
 

Sir Francis Wythers? When was he 
christened, married, or where did he die ? 
A list of tombstones and tablets from 
Saint Michael's contains not his name. 
Its register of christenings, marriages, 
and burials, beginning in 1538, holds no 
reference to him. Did he belong to 
some other parish, which keeps in hid- 
ing the record of his life, waiting for a 
lucky finder, that prince whose lot it is 
to succeed after the many fail, or did he 
go to the wars with FalstaflF, to receive 
burial "unhousel'd, disappointed, un- 
anel'd".? — for it is difficult to avoid a 
strange mingling of the poetical and 
real in such a quest. Was he one of the 
Lancashire Withers, a family adorned 
by George Wither, the poet, and of 
whose founder mention is made in the 
reign of Edward II. ? " What 's become 
of Waring.?" is no more crucial prob- 
lem, no blinder scent, than that con- 
nected with this elusive donor of a cup. 
The ingenious mind will suggest that 
there may be some mention of goblet 
or giver in Saint Michael's audit books. 
Even so small a matter as paying for 
the inscription, if that were not done
