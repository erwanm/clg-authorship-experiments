less face with pinched and sunken eyes under a worn- 
looking forehead, and a withered mouth whose lips 
parted feebly. 

On her part, Miss Macroyd had doubtless already 
noted that the girl was, with no show of expensiveness, 
authoritatively well gowned and personally hatted. She 
stared at her, and said, " What a very hunted and es- 
caping effect." 

" She does look rather — fugitive," Verrian agreed, 
staring too. 

" One might almost fancy — an asylum." 

" Yes, or a hospital." 

They continued both to stare at her, helpless for what- 
ever different reasons to take their eyes away, and they 
were still interested in her when they heard her asking 
the conductor, " Must I change and take another train 
before we get to Belf ord ? My friends thought — " 

" No, this train stops at Southfield," the conductor 
answered, absently biting several holes into her draw- 
ing-room ticket. 

" Can she be one of us ?" Miss Macroyd demanded, in 
a dramatic whisper. 

" She might be anything," Verrian returned, try- 
ing instantly, with a whir of his inventive machinery, to 
phrase her. He made a sort of luxurious failure of it, 
and rested content with her face, which showed itself 
now in profile and now fronted him in full, and now 
was restless and now subsided in a look of delicate 
exhaustion. He would have said, if he would have said 
anything absolute, that she was a person who had some- 

 

thing on her mind; at instants she had that hunted 
air, passing at other instants into that air of escape. 
He discussed these appearances with Miss Macroyd, but 
found her too frankly disputatious; and she laughed 
too much and too loud.

At Southfield, where they all descended, Miss Mac- 
royd promptly possessed herself of a groom, who came 
forward tentatively, touching his hat. " Miss Mac- 
royd ?" she suggested. 

" Yes, miss," the man said, and led the way round 
the station to the victoria which, when Miss Macroyd's 
maid had mounted to the place beside her, had no room' 
for any one else. 

Verrian accounted for her activity upon the theory 
of her quite justifiable wish not to arrive at Seasands 
with a young man whom she might then have the effect 
of having voluntarily come all the way with ; and after 
one or two circuits of the station it was apparent to him 
that he was not to have been sent for from Mrs. West- 
angle's, but to have been left to the chances of the 
local drivers and their vehicles. These were reduced 
to a single carryall and a frowsy horse whose rough 
winter coat recalled the aspect of his species in the 
period following the glacial epoch. The mud, as of a 
world-thaw, encrusted the wheels and curtains of the 
carryall. 

Verrian seized upon it and then went into the wait- 
ing-room, where he had left his suit-case. He found 
the stranger there in parley with the young woman in 
the ticket-office about a conveyance to Mrs. Westangle's. 
It proved that he had secured not only the only thing 
of the sort, but the only present hope of any other, and 
in the hard case he could not hesitate with distress so 

 

interesting. It would have been brutal to drive off and 
leave that girl there, and it would have been a vulgar 
flourish to put the entire vehicle at her service. Be- 
sides, and perhaps above all, Verrian had no idea of 
depriving himself of such a chance as heaven seemed to 
offer him. 

He advanced with the delicacy of the highest-bred 
hero he could imagine, and said, " I am going to Mrs. 
Westangle's, and I'm afraid I've got the only con- 
veyance — such as it is. If you would let me offer you 
half of it? Mr. Verrian," he added, at the light of 
acceptance instantly kindling in her face, which flushed 
thinly, as with an afterglow of invalidism.
