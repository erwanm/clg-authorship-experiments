"Hush," he said. "Do not speak of that. You have done far more for me 
than I ever can do for you?" 

"I? No. I have done nothing." 

"You saved my father's life." 

"Your father's life? You are under some mistake. I never knew a Mr. Digby 
till I knew you I never even heard the name." 

"You knew a Mr. Southwode," said he smiling.

"Southwode? Southwode! The English gentleman! But you are not his son?" 

"I am his son. I am Digby-Southwode. I took my mother's name for certain 
business reasons." 

"And you are his son! How wonderful! That strange gentleman's son!--But I 
did not do so much for your father, Mr. Southwode. You have done 
everything for me." 

"I wish I could do more," said he shortly. 

"I am ashamed to ask,--and yet, I was going to ask you to do something 
more--a last service--for me. It is too much to ask." 

"I am sure it is not that," he said with great gentleness. "Let me know 
what you wish." 

Mrs. Carpenter hesitated. "Rotha does not know,"--she said then. "She has 
no idea--" 

"Of what?" 

"She has no idea that I am going to leave her." 

"I am afraid that is true." 

"And it will be soon Mr. Digby." 

"Perhaps not; but what is it you wish of me?" 

"Tell her--" whispered Mrs. Carpenter. 

The young man might feel startled, or possibly an inevitable strong 
objection to the service demanded of him. He made no answer; and Mrs. 
Carpenter soon went on. 

"It is wrong to ask it, and yet whom shall I ask? I would not have her 
learn it from any of the people in the house; though they are kind, they 
are not discreet; and Rotha would in any case come straight to me; and 
I--cannot bear it. She is a passionate child; violent in her feelings 
and in the expression of them. I have been thinking about it day and 
night lately, and I cannot get my courage up to face the first storm of 
her distress. My poor child! she is not very fitted to go through the 
world alone." 

"What are your plans for her?" 

"I am unable to form any." 

"But you must tell me what steps you wish me to take in her behalf--if 
there is no one whom you could better trust." 

"There is no one whom I can trust at all. Except only my Father in 
heaven. I trust him, or I should die before my time. I thought my heart 
would break, a while ago; now I have got over that. Do you know He has 
said, 'Leave thy fatherless children to me'?" 

Yet now the mother's tears were falling like rain. 

"I will do the very best I can," said the young man at her side; "but I 
wish you would give me some hints, or directions, at least." 

"How can I? There lie but two things before me;--that Mrs. Cord should 
bring her up and make a sempstress of her; or that Mrs. Marble should 
teach her to be a mantua-maker; and I am so foolish, I cannot bear the 
thought of either thing; even if they would do it, which I do not know." 

"Make your mind easy. She shall be neither the one thing nor the other. 
Rotha has far too good abilities for that. I will not give her to Mrs. 
Cord's or Mrs. Marble's oversight. But what would you wish?" 

"I do not know. I must leave you to judge. You can judge much better than 
I. I have no knowledge of the world, or of what is possible. Mrs. Marble 
tells me there are free schools here--" 

"Of course she shall go to school. I will see that she does. And I will 
see that she is under some woman's care who can take proper care of her. 
Do not let yourself be troubled on that score. I promise you, you need 
not. I will take as good care of her as if she were a little sister of my 
own." 

There was silence at first, the silence of a heart too full to find 
words. Mrs. Carpenter sat with her head a little bowed. 

"You will lose nothing by it," she said huskily after a few minutes. 
"There is a promise somewhere--"
