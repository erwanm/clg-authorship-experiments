Better promise at once." 

" Wouldn 't that be too much like marrying a man 
to et rid of him ? " 



 

"I don 't think that 's always such a bad plan 
for tin; man." He waited for her to speak ; but she 
had gone the length of her tether in this direction. 
" JJyron says, 

Man 's love is of man 's life a thing apart, 
It is woman 's whole, existence. 

Do you believe that? " He dwelt upon her witli his 
free look, in the happy embarrassment with which she 
let her head droop. 

"I don 't know," she murmured. "I don 't know 
anything about a man 's life." 

"It was the woman 's I was asking about." 

" I don 't think I in competent to answer." 

" Well, I 'll  tell you, then. I think Byron was 
mistaken. My experience is, that, when a man is in 
love, there 's nothing else of him. That 's the reason 
I 've kept out of it altogether of late years. My ad 
vice is, don 't fall in love : it takes too much time." 
They both laughed at this. " But about correspond 
ing, now ; you haven 't said whether you would write 
to mo, or not. Will you ? " 

" Can 't you wait and see ? " she asked, slanting a 
look at him, which she could not keep from being fond. 

"No, no. Unless you wrote to me I couldn 't go 
to Chicago." 

Perhaps I ought to promise, then, at cmce." 

"You mean that you wish me to go." 

" You said that you were going. You oughtn 't to 
let anything stand in the way of your doing the best 
you can for yourself." 

" But you would miss me a little, wouldn 't you ? 
You would try to miss me, now and then ? " 

"Oli, you are here pretty often. I don 't think I 
should have much difficulty in missing you." 

"Thanks, thanks! I can go with a light heart, 
now. Good by." He made a pretence of rising 



 

" What ! Are you going at once ? " 

" Yes, this very night, or to-morrow. Or no, I 
can 't go to-morrow. "There 's something I was going 
to do to-morrow." 

" Perhaps go to church." 

" Oh, that of course. But it was in the afternoon. 
Stop ! I have it ! I want you to go sleigh -riding 
with me in the afternoon." 

" I don 't know about that," Marcia began. 

" But I do," said the young man. " Hold on : I ll 
put my request in writing." He opened her port 
folio, which lay on the table. "What elegant sta 
tionery ! May I use some of this elegant stationery ? 
The letter is to a lady, to open a correspondence. 
May I ?" She laughed her assent. "How ought I to 
begin? Dearest Miss Marcia, or just Dear Marcia: 
which is better ?" 

" You had better not put either 

" But I must. You 're one or the other, you know. 
You re. dear to your family, and you 're Marcia : 
you can 't deny it. The only question is whether 
you 're the dearest of all the Miss Marrias. I may 
he mistaken, you know. We 'll  err on the sale side : 
Dear Marcia,:" He wrote it down. "That looks 
well, and it reads well. It looks very natural, and it 
reads like poetry, blank verse ; there 's no rhyme. 
for it that I can remember. Dear Marcia : Will you 
go sleigh-riding with me id-morrow afternoon, at two 
o clock sharp ? Yours yours ? sincerely, or cor
