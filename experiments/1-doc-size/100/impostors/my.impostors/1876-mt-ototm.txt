Of course, on the great rise, down came a swarm 
of prodigious timber-ral'Ls from the head waters of 
the Mississippi, coal barges from Pittsburgh, little 
trading scows from eveiywliere, and broad-horns 
from " Posey County," Indiana, freighted with 
" fruit and furniture " — the usual term for describ- 
ing it, though in plain English the freight thus 
aggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots 
bore a mortal hatred to these craft ; and it was 
returned with usury. The law required all such 
helpless traders to keep a light burning, but it was 
a law that was often broken. All of a sadden on 
a murky night a light would hop up, right under 
our bowSj almost, and au agonized voice, with the 
backwoods " whang " to it, would wail out : 

" What 'n the you goin' to ! Cain't you see 

nothin', you dash-dashed aig-suckin', sheep-stealin', 
one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey !" 

Then for an instant, as we whistled by, the red 
glare from our furnaces would reveal the scow and 
the form of the gesticulating orator as if under a 
lightning flash, and in that inst?ini our firemen and 
deck-hands would penJ and receive a tempest of 
missiles ad profanity, one of our wheels would 
wj'lk off with the crashing fragments of a steering- 
oar, and down the dead blackness would shut again. 
And that flatboatman would be sure to go into New 
Orleans and sue our boat, swearing stoutly that he 
had a light burning all the time, when in truth his 
gang had the lantern down below to sing and lie 
and drink and gamble by, and no watch on deck. 
Once, at night, in one oi' those forest-bordered 
crevices (behind an island) which stoaniboatiucn 
intensely describe with the phrase "a:; (hxrk as the 
inside of a cow," we should have eaten up a Posey 
County family, fruit, furniture, and all, but that 
they happened to be tiddliug down below and we 
just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer 
off, doing no serious damage, unfortunately, but 
coming so near it that we had good hopes for a 
moment. These people brought up their lantern, 
then, of course ; and as we backed and filled to get 
away, the precious family stood in the light of it — 
both sexes and various ages — and cursed us till 
everything turned blue. Once a coal-boatman sent 
a bullet through our pilot-house, when we borrowed 
a steering-oar of him, in a very narrow place. 
During this big rise these small-fry craft were 

, an intolerable nuisance. We were running chute 
after chute, — a new world to me, — and if there was 
a particularly cramped place in a chute, we were 

. pretty sure to meet a broad-horn there ; and if he 
failed to be there, we would find him in a still 
worse locality, namely, the head of the chute, on the 
shoal water. And then there would be no end of 
profane cordialities exchanged. 

Sometimes, in the big river, when we would be 
feeling our way cautiously along through a fog, the 

deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells and 
a clamor of tin pans, and all in an instant a log 
raft would appear vaguely through the webby veil, 
close upon as ; and then we did not wait 'to swap 
knives, but snatched our engine bells out by the 
roots and piled on all the steam we had, to scramble 
out of the way ! One doesn't hit a rock or a solid 
log raft with a steamboat when he can get excused. 
You will hardly believe it, but many steamboat 
clerks always carried a large assortment of religious 
tracts with them in those old departed steamboat- 
ing days. Indeed they did. Twenty times a day 
we would be cramping up around a bar, while a 
string of these small-fry rascals were drifting down 
into the head of the bend away above and beyond 
us a couple of miles. Now a skiff would dart away 
from one of them and come lighting its laborious 
way across the desert of water. It would " ease 
all," in the shadow of our forecastle, and the pant- 
ing oarsman would shout, " Gimme a pa-a-per !'* 
as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The clerk would 
throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If 
these were picked up without comment, you might 
notice that now a dozen other skiffs had been drift- 
ing down upon us without saying anything. You 
understand, they had been waiting to see how No. 
I was going to fare. No. 1 making no comment, 
all the rest would bend to their oars and come on, 
and as fast as they came the clerk would now 
heave over neat bundles of religious tracts tied to 
shingles. The amount of hard swearing which 
twelve packages of religious literature will com- 
mand when impartially divided up among twelve 
raftsmen's crews, who have pulled a heavy skiff
