The action of that day was the initial conflict of the 
Seven-days' Battles. General McClellan actually com- 
menced his long-deferred operations against the city of 
Richmond- But the favorable moment had passed by, 



 

and even then the battalions of the rebels were gathering 
in readiness to be hurled upon our devoted army. While 
the regiment, whose fortunes having been more intimately 
connected with our story, was retiring from the pestiferous 
swamp, the commanding general received information 
of the approach of Stonewall Jackson. These proved to 
be sad tidings ; for the anticipated triumphal march into 
the rebel capital was changed into a bloody but glorious 
retreat. The battles which were to be fought for a victo- 
rious advance were made to cover a disastrous defeat, 
disastrous to the campaign, though not to the arncry. 

Fatigued, hungry, and chilled by the night damps of 
the swamp, the regiment threaded its way through the 
intricacies of the woods towards the breastworks in the 
rear. It was a dark and gloomy hour, though the pres- 
tige of victory dwelt in the souls of the gallant soldiers. 
The officers were not familiar with the ground ; and with 
difficulty they found their way back to the old line. 

" Well, Somers, how do you feel?" asked Captain de 
Banyan when the regiment was dismissed. 

" I'm all worn out. I haven't got toughened to this 
kind of work yet," replied Somers. 

" Don't give it up yet, my boy. "We shall be in Rich- 
mond in less than a week, and then we will take rooms 
at the Spottswood House, and have a good time." 

" Do you believe we shall ever get into Richmond, 
captain ? " 



 

" Certainly I do. Every thing is working to my entire 
satisfaction. You feel a little blue, my boy ; but it is only 
because you are tired. You will feel better in the morning." 

" I am tired, but I am not blue. I am ready to do my 
duty, in victory or defeat. There has been an awful roar 
of guns all day, and no one can tell what the result of a 
battle will be." 

" ' An awful roar of guns ' ! 'Pon my word, I like that," 
laughed the captain. " Why, at Magenta" 

" Magenta again ! " sneered Somers, who w r as heartily 
sick of that word. 

" Yes, at Magenta ! If you could only have heard the 
guns there ! Why, there were seven thousand two hun- 
dred and forty-six pieces rattling away like mad on our 
side alone ; and I believe the Russians " 

" Russians at Magenta again ! I don't believe you 
were at the battle of Magenta any more than I was ! " 
exclaimed Somers desperately. 

" Do you mean to tell me that I lie?" asked the cap- 
tain gravely. 

"Go on with your story," said the lieutenant, fearing 
that he had said too much. 

" Answer my question, if you please. You gave me 
the lie ; did you not ? " 

" No : I didn't use that word." 

" You said you didn't believe I was at the battle of 
Magenta." 



 

"To be perfectly candid with you, I don't believe it; 
but I am tired, and want my supper," answered Somers, 
wishing to escape the issue which he had provoked. 

" Fair play, my boy. You charged me with lying, 
indirectly, but not the less offensively on that account. 
Don't dodge the question." 

" I haven't dodged it. I gave you my candid opinion 
that you were not present at Magenta ; and I don't think 
there is an officer in the regiment who believes you were 
there."
