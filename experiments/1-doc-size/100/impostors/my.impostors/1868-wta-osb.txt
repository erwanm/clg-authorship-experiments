was on his way to Vicksburg.

On board of the headquarters boat at Milliken's Bend, Grant was
studying his maps and plans in the ladies' cabin, wholly absorbed in
the mighty thought of planning a campaign. He heeded nothing that
transpired around him, and no one ventured to interrupt him. For hours
he sat in this thoughtful mood, and his friends feared that his mental
labors would overwhelm his physical frame. McPherson at last had the
temerity to speak to him, and presenting a glass of whiskey, invited
him to join the party in a few toasts, to shake off the burden upon his
mind.

"Mac, you know that your whiskey will not help me to think," he
replied, looking up with a smile. "Give me half a dozen of the best
cigars you can find, and if the ladies will excuse me for smoking, I
think by the time I have finished them, I shall have this job pretty
nearly planned."

He continued his labor; the lines on his face deepened again; the
company left him smoking and brooding over his maps and plans; but not
a drop of liquor passed his lips.

"I have some fine brandy on the boat," said a gentleman to him during
the operations at Vicksburg, when Grant seemed to be exhausted by his
cares and his labors; "I will send you a case or two of it."

"I am greatly obliged to you," replied the general; "but I do not use
the article. I have a big job on hand, and though I know I shall win, I
know I must do it with a cool head. Send the liquor you intend for me
to my hospital in the rear. I don't think a little will hurt the poor
fellows down there."

None for himself, strained in mind and muscle by cares and toils that
would have overcome any other man; but a blessed thought for the poor
wounded ones whom he had led to victory over the couch of pain and
death!

At a celebration of Washington's birthday before Vicksburg, the
company, of whom Grant was one, indulged freely in champagne, drinking
patriotic toasts, suggested by the day. The general pushed aside a
glass of the sparkling beverage intended for his use, and took up a
glass of Mississippi water.

"This suits the matter in hand," said he, glancing at the opaque fluid
in the glass. "Drink this toast: God gave us Lincoln and Liberty: let
us fight for both."

President Lincoln quaintly hinted his disbelief in the popular rumors
of Grant's intemperance, when, after the battle of Shiloh, he said, "I
wish all our generals would drink Grant's whiskey."

Before Vicksburg Grant stood alone. The government and the people
were more than doubtful of the result. McClernand, Hunter, Fremont,
and McClellan were mentioned as his successors. Senators and
representatives urged Grant's removal, and one of his corps commanders
was plotting for his place. Still he was struggling for success, while
friends wavered, and enemies cried out against him. To his heavy load
of cares and trials was added this heaviest burden of all--the dread
of being removed before he could carry out the great design which had
been born in his busy brain.

This great design set at nought all the formul√¶ of the military
schools, and was in violation of all the known laws of strategy;
but it was not a new idea. Long before canals and operations, in
accordance with the recognized rules of warfare, had been discarded
as impracticable, he had cherished it as a last resort. The military
engineers of the Confederacy were at least the equals, as scientific
men, of those of the Union. With every means and material in abundance,
they had fortified Vicksburg on the most approved plans, and, aided
by the immense natural advantages of the position, had succeeded in
building up a "Gibraltar" which could not be captured. To them the
issue was no less than the very existence of the Confederacy; for, cut
off from its supplies in Texas, its conquest was only a question of
time. These engineers made sure that they had not deceived themselves.
They piled up defences, and extended their batteries, until Gibraltar
and Sevastopol were beggared in their strength in comparison with
Vicksburg.

Doubtless, measured by the ordinary rules of military security, and by
the ability of any force governed by the recognized canons of warfare,
the Confederate engineers were fully justified in their perfect
confidence. All the communications behind Vicksburg were in their
hands. No base of supplies could be established below or in the rear
of the stronghold. Impenetrable swamps and morasses defended it above,
for they afforded no resting place whereon an army could stand. The
fortified heights of Walnut Hills frowned for miles above the submerged
lands on the Yazoo. The whole strength of the Rebellion was in the
rear of the city, and armies could be rushed in upon a hostile force
gathered there, by the railroads. To any other man than Grant it would
have been a hopeless task; but he set at nought the rules of war under
which Vicksburg was safe.

He announced his plan to his generals. They were startled. All opposed
it. He intended to march through a portion of Louisiana to a point
on the Mississippi, below Vicksburg, cross the river, and strike the
Gibraltar in the rear. The gunboats were to run by the batteries,
and assist in the operations below. The scheme was full of peril. To
transport the army below Vicksburg was to separate it from any base of
supplies; in short, to cut his own communications, to place himself in
just the situation which the rebels would have selected for him. He did
