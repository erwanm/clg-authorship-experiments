Her maid heard the rattle of her night-key and came to relieve her of
her wet things, and to say that Miss Westgard had telephoned and had
left a number to be called as soon as Miss Dumont returned.

The slip of paper bore John Estridge's telephone number and Palla
seated herself at her desk and called it.

Almost immediately she heard Ilse's voice on the wire.

"What is the matter, dear?" inquired Palla with the slightest shiver
of that premonition which had haunted her all day.

But Ilse's voice was cheerful: "We were so sorry not to go with you
this evening, darling, but Jack is feeling so queer that he's turned
in and I've sent for a physician."

"Shall I come around?" asked Palla.

"Oh, no," replied Ilse calmly, "but I've an idea Jack may need a
nurse--perhaps two."

"What is it?" faltered Palla.

"I don't know. But he is running a high temperature and he says that
it feels as though something were wrong with his appendix.

"You see Jack is almost a physician himself, so if it really is acute
appendicitis we must know as soon as possible."

"Is there anything I could do?" pleaded Palla. "Darling, I do so
want to be of use if----"

"I'll let you know, dear. There isn't anything so far."

"Are you going to stay there to-night?"

"Of course," replied Ilse calmly. "Tell me, Palla, how did the
soap-box arguments go?"

"Not very well. I was heckled. I'm such a wretched public speaker,
Ilse;--I can never remember what rejoinders to make until it's too
late."

She did not mention her encounter with the unknown man; Ilse had
enough to occupy her.

They chatted a few moments longer, then Ilse promised to call her if
necessary, and said good-night.

A little after midnight Palla's telephone rang beside her bed and she
started upright with a pang of fear and groped for the instrument.

"Jack is seriously ill," came the level voice of Ilse. "We have taken
him to the Memorial Hospital in one of their ambulances."

"W--what is it?" asked Palla.

"They say it is pneumonia."

"Oh, Ilse!----"

"I'm not afraid. Jack is in magnificent physical condition. He is too
splendid not to win the fight.... And I shall be with him.... I shall
not let him lose."

"Tell me what I can do, darling!"

"Nothing--except love us both."

"I do--I do indeed----"

"Both, Palla!"

"Y--yes."

"Do you understand?"

"Oh, I--I think I do. And I do love you--love you both--devotedly----"

"You must, now.... I am going home to get some things. Then I shall
go to the hospital. You can call me there until he is convalescent."

"Will they let you stay there?"

"I have volunteered for general work. They are terribly short-handed
and they are glad to have me."

"I'll come to-morrow," said Palla.

"No. Wait.... Good-night, my darling."
