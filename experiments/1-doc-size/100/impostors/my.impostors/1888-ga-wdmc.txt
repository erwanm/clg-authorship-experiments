" Quite sure. I have often heard him say he 
had no memory whatever of his mother. And 
grandpapa would never talk with him about her. 
He was a terribly severe old man, they say — he 
died long years before I was born — but he must 
have loved my grandmother very much, for he 
could not bear to hear her name, and he never 
came to the castle after her death." 

"It is strange," said Harold, musingly, "but I 
have surely seen that face before." 

He looked long at the beautiful, life-like picture 
before him. It was marvellously like Weir 




in form and feature and coloring. But the expression
was sad, the eyes were wistful, and the 
whole face was that, not of a woman who had 
lived, but of a woman who knew that out of her 
life had passed the power to live did she bow her 
knee to the Social Decalogue. As Weir stood, 
with her bright, eager, girlish face upheld to the 
woman out of whose face the girlish light had 
forever gone, the resemblance and the contrast 
were painfully striking. 

" I love her! " exclaimed Weir, " and whenever 
I come in here I always kiss her hand." She 
went forward and pressed her lips lightly to the 
canvas, while Dartmouth stood with his eyes 
fastened upon the face whose gaze seemed to 
meet his own and — soften — and invite — 

He stepped forward suddenly as Weir drew 
back. " She fascinates me, also," he said, with a 
half laugh. 'I, too, will kiss her hand." 

III. 

With the exception of the time spent in the 
dining-room, the young people saw little of Sir 
Iltyd. That he liked Dartmouth and enjoyed 
his society were facts he did not pretend to
disguise. But the habits of years were too strong, 
and he always wandered back to his books. He 
did not trouble himself about proprieties. Weir 
had grown up and ruled the castle all these years 



 

without a chaperon, and he had Hved out of the 
world too long to suggest the advisability of one 
now. His daughter and her lover experienced 
no yearning for supervision, and the free, 
untrammelled life was a very pleasant one, 
particularly to Dartmouth, who always gave to novelty 
its just meed of appreciation. At this period, 
in fact, Dartmouth's frame of mind left nothing 
to be desired. In the first place, it was a de- 
lightful experience to find himself able to stand 
the uninterrupted society of one woman from 
morning till night, day after day, without a 
suggestion of fatigue. And in the second, he 
found her a charming study. It is true that he 
was very much in love, very sincerely and pas- 
sionately in love; but at the same time, his brain 
had been trained through too many years to 
the habit of analysis; he could no more help 
studying Weir and drawing her on to reveal 
herself than he could help loving her. She was 
not a difficult problem to solve, individual as she 
was, because she was so natural. Her experi- 
ence with the world had been too brief to give 
her an opportunity to encase herself in any shell 
which would not fall from her at the first reaction 
to primitive conditions; and above all, she was 
in love. 

In the love of a woman there is always a certain 
element of childishness, which has a reflex, 
if but temporary action upon her whole nature. 



 

The phenomenon is due partly to the fact that 
she is under the dominant influence of a wholly 
natural instinct, partly to the fact that the 
object of her love is of stronger make than herself, 
mentally, spiritually, and physically. This sense 
of dependence and weakness, and, consequently, 
of extreme youth, remains until she has children. 
Then, under the influence of peculiarly strong 
responsibilities, she gives her youth to them,
