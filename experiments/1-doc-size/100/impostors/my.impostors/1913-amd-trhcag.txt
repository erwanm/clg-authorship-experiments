Then they were at the station, which was quite a 
pretty little place. The train slowed up, and they 
stepped into it, but it was strange to a little girl 
who had never been in a steam-car to go flying 
along, halting at some stations, and passing others. 
Then a long tunnel that made her shiver and cling 
to the back of the seat in front of her. And then 
the great station with its hurrying throngs of peo- 
ple, the beautiful ferryboat, and there they were 
in the great city. 

For Denby was a very common little farming 
town, with the kind of self-satisfied people who 
considered themselves quite as good as the rest of 
the world, and here were beautifully attired women 
and such lovely children, that she had to give them 
a surprised stare unconsciously. 

Oh, what a day it was ! They went to the fac- 
tory. Mr. Ross had just come in and greeted them 
warmly, and two of the workmen brought the re- 
port of the Newsboys’ Dinner, and the messages 
they had sent. 

There was a queer journey in an elevator up to 
the seventh story, where Mr. Mann had some busi- 




ness, and the ladies sat in what seemed a dainty 
little parlor. Then a ride in the elevated train, 
and how queer it was to go over people’s heads 
and fairly sail through the air ! 

And the splendid stores, and the shopping ! She 
couldn’t recall all of it, but she knew there was a 
pretty new suit in a soft deep red, with a hat to 
match, and a gray fur tippet that seemed to have 
frosted edges. There were so many lovely things 
that were quite beyond her comprehension. 

The luncheon was another surprise. Little 
tables with people eating and chatting, and servants 
flying to and fro. She could hardly eat for the ex- 
citement. 

They had time for a matinee. A glowing, 
dazzling theater that suggested scenes from the 
“ Arabian Nights,” the old tattered book that had 
been such a delight to them. The music was en- 
chanting, the play pretty, though she didn’t half 
understand it. Mr. Mann kept watching the sur- 
prise and delight in her face. Was this the little 
frank, chatty girl he had driven up from Mr. 
Beers’s store that hot summer day? 

When they came out it was snowing, and would 
have been dark but for the countless lamps. Mr. 
Mann kept tight hold of her hand, but oh, how the 
crowd jostled her about! She was tired enough 





when she dropped into her cushioned seat in the 
train. 

At Grafton it had begun to snow at noon. The 
boys went to Dan’s room in the carriage-house, 
while Prim built houses for the twins and told them 
stories. Chan and Marigold were deep in books. 

Tip begged to go down to the station, but they 
were not on that train, and he had half a mind to 
cry. 

“ There are two more trains,” comforted Dan. 

But supposin’ they get snowed up ? ” moaned 
the boy. 

“ Good deal more supposin’ they won’t in a little 
flurry like this,” laughed Dan. “ Why, we haven’t 
had a good downright snowstorm yet. Last win- 
ter it snowed two days.” 

Oh, that was a peeler ! ” cried Linn. I had 
to dig out the hen-house, and our cistern froze up. 
We couldn’t go to school for days.” 

No one begged to go down the second time. The 
twins fell asleep on the soft rug. Marigold was 
haunted by a fear that something had happened. 
But there was the sleigh stopping at the door, and 
five of them rushed out, nearly upsetting their 
mother in the hall.
