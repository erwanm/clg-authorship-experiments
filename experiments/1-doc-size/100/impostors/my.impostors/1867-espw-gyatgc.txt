As ever, lovingly, 

MOTHER. 

When Gypsy had read this for the third 
time, she threw her Virgil and Lexicon with 
such a bang upon the floor that quiet Jane 
jumped half-way across the room. 

"Why, Gypsy! What on earth is the 
matter?" 

" Nothing," said Gypsy, with flushed cheek, 
"only I have something to say to mother; 
that 's all" 



She sat straight down and wrote : 

"Why, mother! Why, I never! Why, 
how could you? You just went and hinted 
that Maude Clare isn't a perfect lady you 
know you did ! Why, she 's so par&Vular, and 
so proud, you ve no idea; and last summer 
one day a gentleman kissed her and she fired 
up and told him he didn't dare to do that 
again, and he did it again, and by-and-by she 
got up and walked right out of the room. She 
never lets people take liberties with her, and 
she 's so polite, too, and I think you re very 
much mistaken, and I don't see what made you 
say such a thing, for you see you don't know 
hardly anything about her; only what I 've 
told you; and I don't see how I can help 
knowing best, mother, I 'm sure." 

Had Gypsy seen the smile with which her 
mother read this, she would have been more 
perplexed than ever. 

One afternoon when study-hours were over, 
Maude Clare came upstairs to ask Gypsy to 
go to walk with her. 



" Why you see," said Gypsy, hesitating, 
with a glance at the window, where her room 
mate was finishing her French exercise, " I 
promised Jane I 'd go with her. I don't go 
with her very often, you know. It 's too 
bad, though; I 'd a great deal rather go with 
you." 

This was in a whisper, but whispers are al 
ways more easily audible than people suppose; 
Jane may have heard it, for she turned over the 
leaves of her Fasquelle quickly, with a sudden 
flush upon her cheek. 

"Oh, Jane doesn't care; do you, Jane?" 
said Maude, aloud. 

" Care about what? " 

" Let Gypsy go to walk with me, there 's 
a good girl. I have a particular reason for 
wanting her to-day." 

"A particular reason?" questioned Gypsy, 
curious and undecided. 

" Oh, don't mind me," spoke up Jane, hur 
riedly. " I don't care that is, I mean I 
would rather have you do as you feel about it 



I can go with Phoebe Hand just as well, you 
know." 

" It 's a very particular reason," urged Maude. 

Gypsy, still looking undecided, began to put 
on her things, saying something to Jane mean 
while about being sorry, and hating to break 
an engagement, and she didn't know 
but 

Jane put an end to the matter by running 
down to find Phoebe ; and Gypsy and Maude 
Clare went slowly down after her, and out of 
the house. Maude was chattering about the 
fit of her gloves. Gypsy did not listen. 

" It is good," she interrupted suddenly. 

"What the colour?"
