the yacht close-hauled, she had brought up on the 
Isles of Shoals. Tom helped him solve this diffi- 
culty by declaring that he had not been very par- 
ticular in keeping her close up to the wind. 

Having satisfied himself on this point, the youth- 



 

ful skipper proceeded to decide upon his future 
course. If he continued to sail towards the north, 
he was in danger of running upon Boon Island. 
The night was coming on, and it promised to be 
a night of peril. what 

There were only two methods open to the young 
navigator. He must either attempt to make Ports- 
mouth harbor again, or stand out to sea. In the 
dense fog, it would be extremely perilous for hinr 
to try to find the port from which they had sailed ; 
and on the other hand, it seemed scarcely less 
perilous to go to sea with the prospect of a gale 
before him. It was an anxious moment for poor 
Paul, for he felt that the safety of the yacht and 
of his misguided companions were in his keeping, 
and before God he felt responsible for them. He 
tried to hold a consultation with Tom and some 
of the larger boys, but they were utterly incapable 
of giving him any advice. They were completely 
bewildered, and looked up to Paul as children to 
a father, in the midst of the dangers into which 
they had so recklessly and criminally plunged. 

 

The heart of the young captain was full, as he 
thought of his mother and his friends at home. 
He felt his own weakness, his own ignorance, and 
stealing away from his companions, he went below, 
and, on his bended knee, looked to Heaven for that 
strength and that knowledge which Heaven alone 
can give in the hour of peril. He prayed for him- 
self, for his brother, and for all his companiona; 
but especially did he ask God to give him wisdom 
to guide the frail bark through the perils that 
environed her. 

The prayer gave him resolution, and, as though 
his earnest supplication had been heard, he felt 
competent to decide between the two courses which 
alone were left open to him. The shore was stud- 
ded with dangers ; and the broad ocean, though 
lashed into fury by the increasing tempest, was 
preferable to a lee shore. The Flyaway was a 
stiff sea-boat, and if well-managed, would ride out 
any gale that would be likely to come upon them 
at this season of the year. 

On his return to the deck, therefore, he ordered 



 

all hands to stand by the jib sheet while he took 
thQ helm himself. His directions were so skil- 
fully given, and so well obeyed, that the Flyaway 
came about as handsomely as though Captain Gor- 
don himself had controlled the manoeuvre. Her 
course was laid exactly east, and the compass was 
placed in a convenient position for use. 

Dick now summoned the crew to supper. Sev- 
eral of them looked at Paul, but no one ventured 
to leave the post of duty till explicit orders had 
been given to that effect. Half the boys were 
permitted to "pipe to supper," while the other 
half were to remain on duty. 

After the meal was disposed of, Paul gave the 
helm to Tom, and went forward to make his ar- 
rangement for the night. The foresail was reefed 
in readiness for use in case it should blow too 
hard for the vessel to carry the jib and mainsail ; 
the fore hatch was carefully secured to guard 
against the peril of "shipping a sea;" and such 
other preparations were made as the occasion 
required. 



 

On his return to the standing room, Paul ft)und 
that Tom could not steer by compass, and he was 
obliged to take the helm himself. Among the 
appointments of the Fawn, there was a compass ; 
and Paul, more for the purpose of familiarizing
