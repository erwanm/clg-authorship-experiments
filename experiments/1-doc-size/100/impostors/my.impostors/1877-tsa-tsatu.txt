" My son." The father spoke in tenderness, 
yet firmly. There came no answer. 



 

" Come to me, Alfred." 

The boy came, slowly, great drops glistening 
on his eyelashes, and wetting his cheeks. 

" That was a fine castle, my son." 

The child answered with a sob. He saw, yet, 
only the ruins. 

"A beautiful castle," added the father, "and 
you builded it." 

Out of the ruins began to arise, in the child 's 
mind, the fair creation which he had wrought 
only a little while before. His quivering lip 
grew firmer, a glimmer of light shone through 
his tears. 

"And you can build it again. Be a brave, 
strong boy. Clear away the ruins, as we do after 
a fire, and set the foundations once more." 

Only a word or two beyond these were needed. 
The child was soon at his castle-building again, 
all absorbed in the work; and soon the low music 
of his happy heart came murmuring through his 
lips. 

"There was a sweet nut within that bitter 



 

husk, Mr. Fanshaw," said the friend; "and if 
you will take a lesson from a child, and go to 
building again, you will find a sweet nut in your 
misfortune also." 

And doubtless he found the rich and juicy ker 
nel, for in a little while afterwards, under the 
spur of necessity, he was out in the busy world, 
and at work, trying to build once more. 




 



XVII. 

AN HOUR WITH MYSELF. 

" I DON 'Tthink you know yourself, Mr. Self- 

complacency." 

I had been speaking, a little boastfully, of my 
good qualities ; particularly of my disinterested 
ness and integrity, when the individual with 
whom I was conversing, threw that wet blanket 
over me. 

"Not know myself?" so I said to myself, 
after parting, a little coldly, with my plain-spoken 
friend, "that 's a good joke! If I, Mr. Self-com 
placency, don 't know myself, pray who does know 
me ? Certainly, not you, Mr. Freespeech !" 

I was piqued at Mr. Freespeech, and could not 
get over his remark, which involved a great deal 
that was not very flattering to my self-esteem. It 
annoyed me like a mote in the eye. 



 

"Not know myself?" I kept repeating the 
words, every now and then, all day ; and when I 
sat down alone in my room at night, they came in 
to disturb the hours that usually passed with me 
in calm self-satisfaction. 

"Not know myself?" What did he mean by 
that? I saw by his eye and voice, that he was 
in earnest. Somebody has been talking about 
me, and putting wrong constructions on my acts, 
and Mr. Freespeech has been more ready to be
