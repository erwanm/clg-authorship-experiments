lives, King over all. He was God as well as man, 
so the grave could not hold him. But he paid 
our debt, darling." 

" You said, death was everlasting separation from 
God and good," said Dolly very solemnly. 

" For us, it would have been." 

" But he did not die that way ? " 

" He could not, for he is the glorious Son of God. 
He only tasted death for us; that we might not 
drink the bitter cup to eternity." 

" Aunt Harry," said Dolly, " is all that trite ? " 

" Certainly." 

"When did he do that?" 

" It is almost nineteen hundred years ago. And 
since then, if any one trusts his word and is willing to be his servant, Jesus loves him, and keeps 
him, and saves him, and makes him blessed for 
ever." 

" But why did he do that ? what made him ? " 

" His great love for us." 

" Us?" Dolly repeated. 

"Yes. You and me, and everybody. He just 
came to save that which was lost." 

" I don't see how he can love me," said Dolly

too, Aunt Harry." 

" Will you, my darling ? " 

" But I do not know how to be his servant." 

"Jesus will teach you himself, if you ask him." 

" How will he teach me ? " 

"He will make you understand his word, and 
let you know what pleases him. He says, * If ye 
love me, keep my commandments.' " 

"His commandments are in the Bible, aren't 



'Certainly. You say you have not got a Bible?" 

"No." 

"Then we will see about that to-morrow, the 
first thing we do. You shall have a Bible, and 
that will tell you about his commandments." 

"Aunt Harry, I would like him to know to- 
night that I love him." 

"Then tell him so, dear." 

" Can I ? " 

" To be sure you can. Why not ? " 

" I do not know how." 

" Tell him, Dolly, just as if the Lord Jesus were 
here present and you could see him. He is here, 
only you do not see him ; that is all the difference 
Tell him, Dolly, just as you would tell me; only
