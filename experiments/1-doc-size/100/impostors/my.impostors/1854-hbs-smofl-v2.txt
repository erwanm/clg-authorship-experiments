gifted uncle as you might have done had he been yours. 

Macaulay is celebrated as a conversationalist ; and, like Coleridge, Carlyle, and almost every one who enjoys this reputation, he has sometimes been accused of not allowing people 
their fair share in conversation. This might prove an objection, possibly, to those who wish to talk; but as I greatly 
prefer to hear, it would prove none to. me. I must say, however, that on this occasion the matter was quite equitably 
managed. There were, I should think, some twenty or thirty 
at the breakfast table, and the conversation formed itself 
into little eddies of two or three around the table, now and 
then welling out into a great bay of general discourse. I was 
seated between Macaulay and Milman, and must confess I 
was a little embarrassed at times, because I wanted to hear 
what they were both saying at the same time. However, by 
the use of the faculty by which you play a piano with both 
hands, I got on very comfortably. 

Milman's appearance is quite striking ; tall, stooping, with 
a keen black eye and perfectly white hair — a singular and 




 

poetic contrast, , He began upon architecture and Westminster Abbey — a subject to which I am always awake. I 
told him I had not yet seen Westminster ; for I was now 
busy in seeing life and the present, and by and by I meant 
to go there and see death and the past. 

Milman was for many years dean of Westminster, and 
kindly offered me his services, to indoctrinate me into its 
antiquities. 

Macaulay made some suggestive remarks on cathedrals 
generally. I said that I thought it singular that we so seldom 
knew who were the architects that designed these great buildings; that they appeared to me the most sublime efforts of 
human genius. 

He said that all the cathedrals of Europe were undoubtedly 
the result of one or two minds ; that they rose into existence 
very nearly contemporaneously, and were built by travelling 
companies of masons, under the direction of some systematic 
organization. Perhaps you knew all this before, but I did 
not ; and so it struck me as a glorious idea. And if it is 
not the true account of the origin of cathedrals, it certainly 
ought to be ; and, as our old grandmother used to say, " I'm 
going to believe it." 

Looking around the table, and seeing how every body 
seemed to be enjoying themselves, I said to Macaulay, that 
these breakfast parties were a novelty to me; that we never
had them in America, but that I thought them the most delightful form of social life. 

He Beized upon the idea, as he often does, and turned 
it playfully inside out, and shook it on all sides, just as 
one might play with the lustres of a chandelier — to see them 
glitter, lie expatiated on the merits of breakfast parties as 


compared with all other parties. He said dinner parties are 
mere formalities. You invite a man to dinner because you 
must invite him ; because you are acquainted with his grand- 
father, or it is proper you should ; but you invite a man to 
breakfast because you want to see him. You may be sure, 
if you are invited to breakfast, there is something agreeable 
about you. This idea struck me as very sensible ; and we 
all, generally having the fact before our eyes that we were 
invited to breakfast, approved the sentiment. 

" Yes," said Macaulay, " depend upon it; if a man is a bore 
he never gets an invitation to breakfast." 

" Rather hard on the poor bores," said a lady. 

" Particularly," said Macaulay, laughing, " as bores are 
usually the most irreproachable of human beings. Did you 
ever hear a bore complained of when they did not say that he 
was the best fellow in the world ? For my part, if I wanted 
to get a guardian for a family of defenceless orphans, I should 
inquire for the greatest bore in the vicinity. I should know 
that he would be a man of unblemished honor and integrity." 

The conversation now went on to Milton and Shakspeare. 
Macaulay made one remark that gentlemen are always making, and that is, that there is very little characteristic differ- 
ence between Shakspeare's women. Well, there is no hope 
for that matter ; so long as men are not women they will think 
so. In general they lump together Miranda, Juliet, Desdemona, and Viola, 

" As matter too soft a lasting mark to bear, 
And best distinguished as black, brown, or fair." 

It took Mrs. Jameson to set this matter forth in her Characteristics of Women; a book for which Shakspeare, if he 
could get up, ought to make her his best bow, especially as 
there are fine things ascribed to him there, which, I dare say, 
he never thought of, careless fellow that he was ! But, I take 
it, every true painter, poet, and artist is in some sense so far 
a prophet that his utterances convey more to other minds than 
he himself knows ; so that, doubtless, should all the old mas- 
ters rise from the dead, they might be edified by what poster- 
ity has found in their works.
