along the curving shore. The Santa Barbara Channel, which may be called
an arm of the Pacific, flows by many a bold point and lovely bay, like
those of San Pedro, Redondo, and Santa Monica; but it has no secure
harbor, except the magnificent and unique bay of San Diego.



The southern and western boundary of Southern California is this mild
Pacific sea, studded with rocky and picturesque islands. The northern
boundary of this region is ranges of lofty mountains, from five thousand
to eleven thousand feet in height, some of them always snow-clad, which
run eastward from Point Conception nearly to the Colorado Desert. They
are parts of the Sierra Nevada range, but they take various names,
Santa Ynes, San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and they are spoken of all
together as the Sierra Madre. In the San Gabriel group, "Old Baldy"
lifts its snow-peak over nine thousand feet, while the San Bernardino
"Grayback" rises over eleven thousand feet above the sea. Southward of
this, running down into San Diego County, is the San Jacinto range, also
snow-clad; and eastward the land falls rapidly away into the Salt Desert
of the Colorado, in which is a depression about three hundred feet below
the Pacific.


The Point Arguilles, which is above Point Conception, by the aid of the
outlying islands, deflects the cold current from the north off the coast
of Southern California, and the mountain ranges from Point Conception
east divide the State of California into two climatic regions, the
southern having more warmth, less rain and fog, milder winds, and less
variation of daily temperature than the climate of Central California to
the north.[A] Other striking climatic conditions are produced by the
daily interaction of the Pacific Ocean and the Colorado Desert,
infinitely diversified in minor particulars by the exceedingly broken
character of the region--a jumble of bare mountains, fruitful
foot-hills, and rich valleys. It would be only from a balloon that one
could get an adequate idea of this strange land.

conditions I am wholly indebted to Dr. P. C. Remondino and Mr. T. S. Van
Dyke, of San Diego, both scientific and competent authorities.]

The United States has here, then, a unique corner of the earth, without
its like in its own vast territory, and unparalleled, so far as I know,
in the world. Shut off from sympathy with external conditions by the
giant mountain ranges and the desert wastes, it has its own climate
unaffected by cosmic changes. Except a tidal wave from Japan, nothing
would seem to be able to affect or disturb it. The whole of Italy feels
more or less the climatic variations of the rest of Europe. All our
Atlantic coast, all our interior basin from Texas to Manitoba, is in
climatic sympathy. Here is a region larger than New England which
manufactures its own weather and refuses to import any other.



With considerable varieties of temperature according to elevation or
protection from the ocean breeze, its climate is nearly, on the whole,
as agreeable as that of the Hawaiian Islands, though pitched in a lower
key, and with greater variations between day and night. The key to its
peculiarity, aside from its southern exposure, is the Colorado Desert.
That desert, waterless and treeless, is cool at night and intolerably
hot in the daytime, sending up a vast column of hot air, which cannot
escape eastward, for Arizona manufactures a like column. It flows high
above the mountains westward till it strikes the Pacific and parts with
its heat, creating an immense vacuum which is filled by the air from
the coast flowing up the slope and over the range, and plunging down
6000 feet into the desert. "It is easy to understand," says Mr. Van
Dyke, making his observations from the summit of the Cuyamaca, in San
Diego County, 6500 feet above the sea-level, "how land thus rising a
mile or more in fifty or sixty miles, rising away from the coast, and
falling off abruptly a mile deep into the driest and hottest of American
deserts, could have a great variety of climates.... Only ten miles away
on the east the summers are the hottest, and only sixty miles on the
west the coolest known in the United States (except on this coast), and
between them is every combination that mountains and valleys can
produce. And it is easy to see whence comes the sea-breeze, the glory of
the California summer. It is passing us here, a gentle breeze of six or
eight miles an hour. It is flowing over this great ridge directly into
the basin of the Colorado Desert, 6000 feet deep, where the temperature
is probably 120°, and perhaps higher. For many leagues each side of us
this current is thus flowing at the same speed, and is probably half a
mile or more in depth. About sundown, when the air on the desert cools
and descends, the current will change and come the other way, and flood
these western slopes with an air as pure as that of the Sahara and
nearly as dry.



"The air, heated on the western slopes by the sea, would by rising
produce considerable suction, which could be filled only from the sea,
but that alone would not make the sea-breeze as dry as it is. The
principal suction is caused by the rising of heated air from the great
desert.... On the top of old Grayback (in San Bernardino) one can feel
it [this breeze] setting westward, while in the cañons, 6000 feet below,
it is blowing eastward.... All over Southern California the conditions
of this breeze are about the same, the great Mojave Desert and the
valley of the San Joaquin above operating in the same way, assisted by
interior plains and slopes. Hence these deserts, that at first seem to
be a disadvantage to the land, are the great conditions of its climate,
and are of far more value than if they were like the prairies of
Illinois. Fortunately they will remain deserts forever. Some parts will
in time be reclaimed by the waters of the Colorado River, but wet spots
