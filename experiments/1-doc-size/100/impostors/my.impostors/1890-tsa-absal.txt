ness, for I knew their dread of fire. At last the dawn 
appeared, and fresh and hopeful we re-commenced our ad- 
venturous journey. 

We soon discovered on the other side of what seemed 
an interminable forest, the peaks of the wished for moun- 
tains, and with a joyful shout my companion pointed to 
the goal of our exertions which we hoped to reach in two 
or three days. "Courage!" he cried to me, "let us dare 
anything and everything! I do not require thanks, my 
friend, but you will bless the hour that brought us together." 

VI. 

On the third day we left the river bank and took our 
way across an immense sandy plain only relieved by a few 
straggling bushes here and there : and in the evening we 
reached the borders of the forest which we entered the 
next morning. 




Our path became more and more intricate ; we made 
our way with difficulty through the briars and heaps of 
dried leaves, but too often the abode of deadly reptiles ; 
at every rustling we -stopped and looked carefully around, 
our cocked rifles ready in our hands, in dread lest we 
should encounter some savage animal. 

At noon we came upon two bears, one of whom was 
endeavoring to climb a tree, while the other walked around 
him as if keeping watch. The first quickly accomplished 
his object and hid himself in the boughs, but the other, 
evidently more courageous, looked fixedly at us and showed 
his teeth. 

" Hold !" I cried, " he is aiming for us ; let's try the 
temper of our weapons, or better still, let us take a small 
circuit here and save our strength for him." 

" Nonsense !" replied Manuel, " an elephant or a buffalo 
might make such precaution necessary. But that fellow 
there â€” let us see how he can show his heels." 

And he rashly advanced, applying the most abusive 
terms to the monster, but quickly slackened sail, tor the 
beast, instead of running away, turned round and trotted 
briskly towards us. 

" Jesu Maria, here he comes !" he cried, and we threw 
off our packs, seized our guns and placed ourselves, ready 
for filing, behind two thick trees. It was high time, for 
the beast, growling fearfully, was already only a stone's 
throw distant from us ; I fired, and had the good fortune 
to shatter his right fore paw ; he fell, but recovering him- 
self immediately upon his hind legs, rushed upon the Por- 
tuguese, behind whom I had placed myself, in order to 



 

 load my piece, and who immediately fired, but mfssed, 
and then, instead of presenting his bayonet, ran to conceal 
himself behind another'tree. The furious bear had almost 
reached him when another of my balls pierced his side; 
he tottered, and proped upon his uninjured paw, leaned 
agaanst a tree, and with foaming jaws, began to roar most 
horribly. We expected to see him fall to the ground, but 
with a loud yell, he suddenly raised himself, and ran at 
me so quickly that I had but just time to draw my sabre 
and plunge it up to the hilt in his body. I then sprang 
back, leaving him the weapon, which he tore out of the 
wovmd, and endeavored, in the death-struggle, to tear it 
to pieces with his teeth. 

I cut off one of his ears as a trophy and we went our 
way; but the further we penetrated into the wood, the 
more diflBcult became our progress. We were often forced, 
in order to gain five steps forward, to take twenty in a zig- 
zag direction ; sometimes we came upon old decayed trees, 
into which, if we attempted to climb over, instead of going 
round them, we sunk up to our waists ; sometimes, immense 
quantities of ant hills impeded our progress, or we encoun- 
tered morasses from which issued swarms of musquitoes 
that attacked us with unexampled fury ; sometimes the 
trees rained red ants, who also assailed us unmercifully in 
spite of the most careful covering of our faces and hands, 
and whose bite left a most painful inflammation. But 
worst of all was a kind of reed which grew everywhere, 
and in which our feet were continually entangled as in a 
net. To cap the climax of our misery, these reeds were 



filled with sharp thorns which penetrated our stockingB 
and scratched our legs, most cruelly. 

Half dead with fatigue, our faces and hands covered
