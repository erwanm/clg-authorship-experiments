and attended to them well. 

"But I will keep you, Perkins." 

"Thank you, mem." 

The brushing continued. Presently Perkins said: "If you please, mem, I m to be 
married too." 

In the mirror before her Sally looked at 
the woman in whose face there was not a 
vestige of expression. 

"His name is Arris, mem. He's butler 
and valet, mem, and been only in the best 



houses." 



"Harris!" Sally repeated. "Well, per 
haps, I may take him when I have a house 
of my own, but you will be Perkins just the 



same." 



"Thank you, mem." 

Such was Sally's wooing. The marriage 
was equally enchanting. 

Before it occurred, Malakoff, apprised by 
his avoue of the terms of Sam Kandy's will, 





laughed. It was not a pleasant laugh. Had 
Mrs. Kandy seen him at that moment, she 
would have been alarmed. Could she have 
read his thoughts, she would have known 
that her alarm was justified. 

There was the Due de Chose, who had 
bagged the booty of despoiled Venezuela; 
de la Deche, who had got the loot of the 
wreckage of the railways of the United 
States; Prince Eugene, the most obscure of 
the obscurest Napoleonides, who had gob 
bled the heiress of Monte Carlo's perfumed 
hell; Solferino, who had pocketed the prize 
American dot; d Ostende, who had received 
with his bride a ton of brewery guineas ; and 
he, Malakoff, who was as good as any of 
them, was done, done again, and out a beggarly million at that! 

He could still desist, and would have, but 
an idea occurred to him. It was then that he 
laughed. 

In accordance with local usage, the civil 



 

ceremony, which precedes the religious rites, 
took place at the Mairie of the precinct in 
which Malakoff resided. The formalities, 
brief in themselves, became exasperating by 
reason of a long delay which intervened. 

Afterward, at the Elysee Hotel, Malakoff 
requested a word with Mrs. Kandy. 

"Madam," he began, when Sally had 
gone, "in asking the hand of your daughter, 
I said it was not merely that I might have her 
for wife, but in order, also, that I might have 
you for mother-in-law. Do you recall it?" 

Mrs. Kandy, laced to the point of suf 
focation, wished that he would hurry and 
go. But, manfully, from a red and gilt 
armchair in which she squirmed, she 
smiled.
