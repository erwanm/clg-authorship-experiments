Sir Claude appeared indifferent to that. 
"Did Mrs. Wix go down with you?" he 
only asked. 

" Not she ; she never budged ! " and Mrs. 
Beale's flush, to Maisie's vision, deepened. 
" She moped there she did n't so much as 
come out to me; and when I sent to invite 
her she simply declined to appear. She 
said she wanted nothing, and I went down 
alone. But when I came up, fortunately a 
little primed," and Mrs. Beale smiled 
a fine smile of battle " she was in the 
field!" 

" And you had a big row ? " 

" We had a big row. " She assented with 
a nod of the same size. "And while you left 
me to that sort of thing I should like to 





know where you were ! " She paused for a 
reply, but Sir Claude merely looked at 
Maisie; a movement that promptly quick- 
ened her challenge. "Where the mischief 
have you been ? " 

" You seem to take it as hard as Mrs. 
Wix," Sir Claude returned. 

" I take it as I choose to take it, and you 
don't answer my question." 

He looked again at Maisie, and as if for 
an aid to this effort; whereupon she smiled 
at her stepmother and offered : " We 've 
been everywhere." 

Mrs. Beale, however, made her no re- 
sponse, thereby adding to a surprise of which 
our young lady had already felt the light 
brush. She had received neither a greeting 
nor a glance; but perhaps this was not 
more remarkable than the omission, in re- 
spect to Sir Claude, parted with in London 
two days before, of any sign of a sense of 
their reunion. Most remarkable of all was 
Mrs. Beale' s announcement of the pledge 
given by Mrs. Wix and not hitherto revealed 
to her pupil. Instead of heeding this wit- 
ness she went on with acerbity : " It might 
surely have occurred to you that something 
would come up." 





Sir Claude looked at his watch. " I had 
no idea it was so late, nor that we had been 
out so long. We were n't hungry. It 
passed like a flash. What has come up? " 

"Oh, that she's disgusted," said Mrs. 
Beale. 

" Disgusted ? With whom ? " 

"With Maisie." Even now she never 
looked at the child, who stood there equally 
associated and disconnected. " For having 
no moral sense." 

"How should she have?" Sir Claude 
tried again to shine a little at the companion 
of his walk. " How, at any rate, is it proved 
by her going out with me? " 

"Don't ask me; ask that woman. She 
drivels when she doesn't rage," Mrs. Beale, 
declared. 

"And she leaves the child? " 

"She leaves the child," said Mrs. Beale 
with great emphasis, looking more than ever 
over Maisie' s head. 

In this position suddenly a change came 
into her face, caused, as the others could, 
the next thing, see, by the reappearance of 
Mrs. Wix in the doorway which, on coming 
in at Sir Claude's heels, Maisie had left 
gaping. "I don't leave the child I don't,
