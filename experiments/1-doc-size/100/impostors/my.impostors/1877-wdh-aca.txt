Cummings : " I am sorry to have been obliged to 
tell you this." 

General Wyatt : " I obliged you, sir ; I obliged 
you. Give me your advice, sir; you know your 
friend. What shall I do ? I am not rich. I don't 
belong to a branch of the government service in 



 

which people enrich themselves. But I have my 
pay ; and if your friend could sell me the pictures 
he 's been painting here " 

Gummings : " That 's quite impossible. There 
is no form in which I could propose such a thing to 
a man of his generous pride." 

General Wyatt : " Well, then, sir, I must satisfy 
myself as I can to remain his debtor. Will you 
kindly undertake to tell him ? " 

An Elderly Serving- Woman, who appears timidly 
and anxiously at the right-hand door : " General 
Wyatt." 

General Wyatt, with a start: "Yes, Mary! 
Well?" 

Mary, in vanishing: "Mrs. Wyatt wishes to 
speak with you." 

General Wyatt, going up to Cummings : " I 
must go, sir. I leave unsaid what I cannot even 
try to say." He offers his hand. 

Cummings, grasping the proffered hand: "Every- 
thing is understood." But as Mr. Cummings re- 
turns from following General Wyatt to the door, 
his face does not confirm the entire security of his 



 

words. He looks anxious and perturbed, and 
when he has taken up his hat and stick, he stands 
pondering absent-mindedly. At last he puts on his 
hat and starts briskly toward the door. Before 
he reaches it, he encounters Bartlett, who advances 
abruptly into the room. "Oh! I was going to 
look for you." 



VI. 

CUMMINGS and BARTLETT. 

Bartlett, sulkily: "Were you?" He walks, 
without looking at Cummings, to where his paint- 
er's paraphernalia are lying, and begins to pick 
them up. 

Cummings: "Yes." In great embarrassment: 
" Bartlett, General Wyatt has been here." 

Bartlett, without looking round : " Who is Gen- 
eral Wyatt?" 

Cummings: "I mean the gentleman who 
whom you wouldn't wait to see." 

Bartlett: "Urn!" He has gathered the things 
into his arms, and is about to leave the room. 

Cummings, in great distress: "Bartlett, Bart- 
lett! Don't go! I implore you, if you have any 
regard for me whatever, to hear what I have to 
say. It's boyish, it's cruel, it's cowardly to be- 
have as you 're doing ! " 



 

Bartktt : "Anything more, Mr. Cummings? I 
give you benefit of clergy." 

Cummings: "I take it to denounce your pro- 
ceeding as something that you 'll always be sorry 
for and ashamed of." 

Bartlett: "Oh! Then, if you have quite freed 
your mind, I think I may go." 

Cummings : " No, no ! You mustn't go. Don't 
go, my dear fellow. Forgive me ! I know how in-
