handsome! You don't know Ellen." Larry thought he 
did know her. He had one of the ironical moments of the 
old when they want to tell you they understand what they 
have lost far better than the young who inherit it. 
" Ellen Brock is a kind of girl — a kind of woman — 
like my mother," said Hugh. His words choked him, and 



 

he shook himself impatiently at the weakness of them. 
" She'll wake up sometime and realize what she's done. 
Did they go away? " 

"No. They're at your house. Ben wanted to go 
away, but she wouldn't." 

" Well," said Hugh. He rose, and stood a moment, 
immovable, looking out of the window at the waving 
I: green. " I'll go over there." 

" Your mother — " said Larry, and then stopped. He 

oi: wanted to say Hugh's mother would be glad to see him, 
and so get her gracious image into the boy's mind, effac- 

S: ing the confusion of its trouble. 

rm " Oh, yes," said Hugh, absently, " I shall see mother. 
Of course." 

He walked out of the door, and Smilie, after curving 

JE about him down the path, returned in great excitement 

 to ask Larry if this wasn't a wonderful day and if they 
mightn't go with him. But Larry pulled her ears ab- 
sently and didn't answer. He thought it was grief he 

had for Hugh. But he had seen into the lad's soul, and 
what he found there woke in him something besides grief. 
It was fear. 

Hugh marched fast across the woods, and when he came 
to the spot where the path turned to the violet bank, 
he remembered, but only for an instant's clutch of his 
hands upon themselves. It was too slight a misery to 
weigh in the scale of his present loss. When he went up 
the lane, he gave one glance at the little house, fearing 
to find it closed and so a hurt the more to Ellen, as to 
his own old sense of childish values. But the blinds were 
open and the vines waving. The beauty of spring was 
there. He went along the road to his father's house, his 
eyes scanning every aspect of the scene. And across the 
road he saw Ben, in shirt and trousers, planting corn. 



 

Ben was working, not after his custom now that his fa- 
ther's eyes were no longer urging him, slowly, and with 
a lazy ease, but furiously. Hugh leaped the wall and 
went to him, walking, though he was climbing the rise, 
faster and faster, tmtil when Ben saw him, he had begun 
to run* Ben stood for a moment incredulous, and then 
threw down his hoe. He gave a shout and ran forward. 
He was shocked into gladness and then, at the same in- 
stant, cooled to apprehension. But from that he recov- 
ered at once. If he had muddled away Hugh's money, it 
was, after all. Aunt Tab's, and Hugh had no exclusive 
business with it. And if Ellen had been the loser, every- 
thing that concerned Ellen touched him only now, for she 
was his. Ben had time to see how Hugh had changed, 
how much the man he was, how charged with fiery 
strength. But he was not prepared for the storm in his 
face, the curt, determined voice: 

" I want to know it all before I see her." 

"Mother?" 

" Ellen. How did you get her? What has she done it 
for? Quick!" 

Ben swaggered a little, not that he underrated the seri- 
ousness of the minute, but because he had to choose a 
defensive attitude. 

" Oh, come," he said. " What's any girl marry for? " 
Then he saw some one nearing, and the sight tied his 
tongue and blanched his face. Hugh, his back to the 
road, noted the change in him and despised him because 
he looked afraid. But Ben was not cowed by him. He 
was dismayed at Grissie, coming up the slope, not now in 
the green of spring but a soft hue that clarified her to a 
wistful beauty. Hugh heard her step and turned. 

" I saw you," she said to him, " when you came across
