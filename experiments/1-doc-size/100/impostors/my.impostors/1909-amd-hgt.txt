“ You will make a good mathematician.” 

“ I don’t see any good in trigonometry, 
and logic. Then the history of those dead 
and gone people that we don’t care anything 
about. Of course we want to know about our 
own country.” 

“ And many people want to know about the 


 

others. Think of China, thousands of years 
old, and the great Tamerlane who swept across 
Asia and meant to conquer it all! No one 
really knows when its curious civilization be- 
gan. And its great philosopher Confucius, 
who iterated a part of the Golden Rule. And 
Egypt's culture and advance long before 
Abraham’s time. Why, I think it very faci- 
nating to go back to the beginning of things if 
we can find them.” 

Helen paused suddenly. There was a time 
when she rebelled against them she remem- 
berd. But if they had been made interesting! 

“ Those old people have been dead and gone 
these many hundred years,” in a tone of dis- 
content. “ I like my own life better, but I 
don't know how to make it suit me. I wish I 
did.” 

Helen wished that she had wisdom enough 
to inspire such girls as these. Teachers must 
get discouraged with the slow progress, and 
just keep to their plain duty like Miss Parker. 
So many of the college teachers were enthu- 
siasts. 

The log broke in two and scattered a shower 




of beautiful sparks. Lilian brought the ends 
together and put on another. That darkened 
the room. How the wind racketed outside and 
occasionally flung itself against the house as 
if it meant to demolish it. But the builder's 
art was stronger than nature in this case. 
How secure one felt! This was among the 
things men had learned, to conquer nature. 
There were ships on the great ocean that were 
“ carried up to heaven and down again to the 
great deep,” yet they came safely through the 
storm. 

“ Miss Grant,” said the rather perturbed 

voice, “ don’t you ever mean to marry? ” 



Helen could have laughed at the incongruous 
change of thought demanded by the question. 

“ I don’t know what I mean to do in that 
respect. There are so many things I want to 
do first.” 

“ But do you not think women are better off, 
happier? ” 

So this was what the poor girl’s mind was 
running on. She recalled an incident at col- 
lege, a girl whose lover had proved recreant 
and who went down to the depths of despair, 


 

and for a while was the dread and vexation of 
teachers. Lilian did not unload her dis- 
appointment on any one, but it was sapping 
away her mental strength nevertheless. What 
could be done for the girl? Was the high 
school the best place for her? Was teaching 
in a half-hearted manner a real benefit to the 
pupil, a fair thing all around ? 

“ You see teachers do not marry as a general 
thing. That Miss Jaynes is very nice but she 
hasn’t any company. And Miss Parker is 
old ” 

“ No, I think we ought not call a woman of 
that age old. If she should live to be seventy 
she would only be in the middle part of her
