old portress who conducts you over the place is to call 
your attention to the indented table of Jean Guiton; 
but she shows you other objects of interest besides. 
The interior is absolutely new and extremely sump 
tuous, abounding in tapestries, upholstery, morocco, 
velvet, satin. This is especially the case with a really 
beautiful grande salle, where, surrounded with the 
most expensive upholstery, the mayor holds his official 
receptions. (So at least, said my worthy portress.) 
The mayors of La Rochelle appear to have changed a 
good deal since the days of the grim Guiton; but 
these evidences of municipal splendor are interesting 
for the light they throw on French manners. Imagine 
the mayor of an English or an American town of 
twenty thousand inhabitants holding magisterial soirees 
in the town-hall! The said grande salle, w r hich is un 
changed in form and its larger features, is, I believe, 
the room in which the Rochelais debated as to whether 
they should shut themselves up, and decided in the 
affirmative. The table and chair of Jean Guiton have 
been restored, like everything else, and are very 
elegant and coquettish pieces of furniture, incongruous 
relics of a season of starvation and blood. I believe 
that Protestantism is somewhat shrunken to-day at La 
Rochelle, and has taken refuge mainly in the haute 
societe and in a single place of worship. There was 
nothing particular to remind me of its supposed austerity 
as, after leaving the hotel de ville, I walked along the 



empty porticos and out of the Tour de PHorloge, 
which I have already mentioned. If I stopped and 
looked up at this venerable monument, it was not to 
ascertain the hour, for I foresaw that I should have 
more time at La Rochelle than I knew what to do 
with; but because its high, gray, weather-beaten face 
\vas an obvious subject for a sketch. 

The little port, which has two basins, and is ac 
cessible only to vessels of light tonnage, had a certain 
gayety and as much local color as you please. Fisher 
folk of picturesque type were strolling about, most 
of them Bretons; several of the men with handsome, 
simple faces, not at all brutal, and with a splendid 
brownness, the golden-brown color, on cheek and 
beard, that you see on an old Venetian sail. It was 
a squally, showery day, with sudden drizzles of sun 
shine; rows of rich-toned fishing-smacks were drawn 
up along the quays. The harbor is effective to the 
eye by reason of three battered old towers which, at 
different points, overhang it and look infinitely weather- 
vrashed and sea-silvered. The most striking of these, 
the Tour de la Lanterne, is a big gray mass, of the 
fifteenth century, flanked with turrets and crowned 
with a Gothic steeple. I found it was called by the 
people of the place the Tour des Quatre Sergents, 
though I know not what connection it has with the 
touching history of the four young sergeants of the 
garrison of La Rochelle, who were arrested in 1821 
as conspirators against the Government of the Bour 
bons, and executed, amid general indignation, in Paris 





in the following year. The quaint little walk, with 
its label of Rue sur les Murs, to which one ascends 
from beside the Grosse Horloge, leads to this curious 
Tour de la Lanterne and passes under it. This walk 
has the top of the old town-wall, toward the sea, for 
a parapet on one side, and is bordered on the other 
with decent but irregular little tenements of fishermen, 
where brown old women, whose caps are as white as 
if they were painted, seem chiefly in possession. In 
this direction there is a very pretty stretch of shore, 
out of- the town, through the fortifications (which are 
Vauban s, by the way); through, also, a diminutive 
public garden or straggling shrubbery, which edges 
the water and carries its stunted verdure as far as a 
big Etablissement des Bains. It was too late in the 
year to bathe, and the Etablissement had the bank 
rupt aspect which belongs to such places out of the 
season; so I turned my back upon it, and gained, by 
a circuit in the course of which there were sundry 
water-side items to observe, the other side of the 
cheery little port, where there is a long breakwater 
and a still longer sea-wall, on which I walked awhile, 
to inhale the strong, salt breath of the Bay of Biscay. 
La Rochelle serves, in the months of July and August, 
as a station de bains for a modest provincial society; 
and, putting aside the question of inns, it must be 
charming on summer afternoons.
