    to the Hall, and I went, too, being anxious, now that you are out
    there alone somewhere in the darkness.

    "Oh, Carus, the sky was all red and fiery behind Tribes Hill; and
    women were crying and children sobbing all around me. I asked the
    Ranger, Mount, if he had news of you, and he was gentle and kind,
    and strove to comfort me, but he went away with his company on a
    run, and I saw the militia assembling where the drummers stood
    beating their drums in the torchlight.

    "Somebody--a woman--said: 'It's hatchet and scalping again, and we
    women will catch it now.'

    "And then a child screamed, and its mother was too weak to carry
    it, so I took it back for her to the jail.

    "I sat in the jailer's room, thinking and thinking. Outside the
    barred window I heard a woman telling how Butler's men had already
    slain a whole family at Caughnawaga--an express having arrived with
    news of horrors unspeakable.

    "Dearest, it came to me like a flash of light what I must do--what
    God meant me to do. Can you not understand, my darling? We are
    utterly helpless here. I must go back to this man--to this man who
    is riding hither with death on his right hand, and on his left
    hand, death!

    "Oh, Carus! Carus! my sin has found me out! It is written that man
    should not put asunder those joined together. I have defied Him!
    Yet He repays, mercifully, offering me my last chance.

    "Sweetheart, I must take it. Can you not understand? This man is my
    lawful husband; and as his wife, I dare resist him; I have the
    right to demand that his Indians and soldiers spare the aged and
    helpless. I must go to him, meet him, and confront him, and insist
    that mercy be shown to these poor, terrified people. And I must
    pay the price!

    "Oh, Carus! Carus! I love you so! Pray for me. God keep you! I must
    go ere it is too late. My horse is at Burke's. I leave this for
    you. Dear, I am striving to mend a shattered life with sacrifice of
    self--the sacrifice you taught me. I can not help loving you as I
    do; but I can strive to be worthy of the man I love. This is the
    only way!

    "ELSIN GREY."

The woman had begun to speak again. I raised my eyes.

"Your sweet lady gave me the letter--I waited while she wrote it in the
warden's room--and she was crying, sir. God knows what she has written
you!--but she kissed me and my little one, and went out into the yard.
I have not seen her since, Mr. Renault."

Would the din of that hellish bell never cease its torture? Would sound
never again give my aching brain a moment's respite? The tumult, men's
sharp voices, the coughing of the sick woman, the dull, stupid blows of
sound were driving me mad! And now more noises broke out--the measured
crash of volleys; cheers from the militia on the parapet; an uproar
swelling all around me. I heard some one shout, "Willett has entered
the town!" and the next instant the smashing roll of drums broke out in
the street, echoing back from fa√ßade and palisade, and I heard the
fifes and hunting-horns playing "Soldiers' Joy!" and the long
double-shuffling of infantry on the run.

The icy current of desperation flowed back into every vein. My mind
cleared; I passed a steady hand over my eyes, looked around me, and,
drawing the ranger's whistle from my belt, set it to my lips.

The clear, mellow call dominated the tumult. A man in deerskin dropped
from the rifle-platform, another descended the ladder, others came
running from the log bastions, all flocking around me like brown deer
herding to the leader's call.

"Fall in!" I scarce knew my own voice.

The eager throng of riflemen fell away into a long rank, stringing out
across the jail yard.

"Shoulder arms! Right dress! Right face! Call off!"

The quick responses ran along the ranks: "Right! left! right!
left!----"

"Right double!" I called. Then, as order followed order, the left
platoon stepped forward, halted, and dressed.

"Take care to form column by platoons right, right front. To the
right--face! March!"

The gates were flung wide as we passed through, and, wheeling, swung
straight into the streets of Johnstown with a solid hurrah!

A battalion of Massachusetts infantry was passing St. John's Church,
filling William Street with the racket of their drums. White
cross-belts and rifles shining, the black-gaitered column plodded past,
mounted officers leading. Then a field-piece, harness and chains
clanking, came by, breasting the hill at a gallop, amid a tempest of
cheers from my riflemen. And now the Tryon County men were passing in
dusty ranks, and more riflemen came running up, falling in behind my
