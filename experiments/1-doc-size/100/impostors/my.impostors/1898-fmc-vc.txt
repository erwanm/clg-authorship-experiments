came and knelt on one knee beside her, resting his 
hand upon the carved arm of her chair. 

"I cannot love you, but in so far as I may be 
faithful to another I give you my whole life," he 
said very gently. 

As he spoke the last words, the curtain of the 
inner apartments was softly raised, and Beatrix 
stood there ; for she had thought that the Queen 
was alone. But she heard not the beginning of the 
speech, and she grew quite cold, and could not speak 
nor go away. 

Eleanor's hands left her face and fell together upon 
Gilbert's right. 

" I have not mine to give," she answered in a low 



 

voice. " It is yours already — and I would that you 
were not English, that I might be your sovereign 
and make you great among men — or that I were 
England's Queen — and that may come to pass, and 
you shall see what I will do for love of you — I 
would marry that boy of the Plantagenets, if it 
could serve you ! " 

"Madam," said Gilbert, "think of your own 
present safety — the King is very angry — " 

" Did I think of your safety when I sent you out 
to lead us? Now if you are here, am I not safe? 
Gilbert — " 

She let her voice caress his name, and her lips 
lingered with it, and she laid her hands upon his 
shoulders. As he knelt beside her — she bent to his 
face. 

" Best and bravest living man " — it was a whisper 
now — " love of my life — heart of my heart — this 
last time — this only once — and then good-by." 

She kissed him on the forehead, and leapt from 
her seat in horror, for there was another voice in the 
room, with a hurt cry. 

"Oh, Gilbert! Gilbert!" 

Beatrix was reeling on her feet, and caught the 
curtain, lest she fall, and her face of agony was still 
turned toward the two, as they stood together. Gil- 
bert sprang forward, when he understood, and caught 
the girl in his arms and brought her to the light, 
trembling like a falling leaf. Then she started in 
his arms and struggled wildly to be free, and twisted 
her neck lest he should kiss her; but he held her 
fast. 





" Beatrix ! You do not understand — you did not 
hear ! " He tried to make her listen to Mm. 

"I heard ! " she cried, still struggling. "I saw ! I 
know ! Let me go — oh, for God's sake, let me go ! " 

Gilbert's arms relaxed, and she sprang back from 
him two paces, and faced the Queen. 

" You have won ! " she cried, in a breaking Toice. 
" You have him body and soul, as you swore you 
would ! But do not say that I have not understood ! " 

" I have given him to you, soul and body," answered 
Eleanor, sadly. " Might I not even bid him good-by, 
as a friend might? " 

"You are false — falser each than the other," 
answered Beatrix, in white anger. " You have played 
with me, tricked me, made me your toy — " 

" Did you hear this man say that he did not love 
me, before I bade him good-by?" asked Eleanor, 
gravely, almost sternly. 

" He has said it to me, but not to you, never to you 
— never to the woman he loves ! " 

"I never loved the Queen," said Gilbert. "On 
my soul — on the Holy Cross — " 

" Never loved her ? And you saved her life before 
mine — "
