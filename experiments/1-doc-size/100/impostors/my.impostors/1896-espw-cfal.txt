than theology. It is more solemn than the 
professor's system. Insistent, urging every 
thing before it, the toil of strenuous study, 
the fret of little trouble, and the dreams of 
dawning love, the call stirs on. It is the 
beat of a drum. 

The boys of old Phillips, with the down on 
their faces, and that eternal fire in their hearts 
which has burned upon the youth of all the 
ages when their country has commanded : " Die 
for me ! " are drilling by moonlight. 

The Academy Company is out in force, passing 
up and down the quiet, studious streets. 
The marching of their feet beats solemnly at 
the meeting of the paths where (like the 
gardens of the professors) the long walks of the 

1 " A sin once committed, always deserves punishment ; and, as 
long as strict Justice is administered, the sin must be punished. 
Unless there be an Atonement, strict Justice must be administered ; 
that is, Sin must be punished forever ; but, on the ground of the 
Atonement, Grace may be administered instead of Justice, and 
then the sinner may be pardoned." 

 

Seminary lawns form the shape of a mighty 
cross. 

" An infinite wrong deserves an infinite 
punishment " The theologian's voice falls 
solemnly. The girls turn their grave faces to 
the open windows. Silence helps the drum 
beat, which lifts its cry to Heaven unimpeded ; 
and the awful questions which it asks, what 
system of theology can answer ? 

Andover was no more loyal, probably, than 
other New England villages ; but perhaps the 
presence of so many young men helped to 
make her seem so to those who passed the 
years from 1861 to 1865 upon the Hill. 

Theology and church history and exegesis 
and sacred rhetoric retreated from the fore 
ground of that scholastic drama. The great 
Presence that is called War swept up and filled 
the scene. 

Gray-haired men went to their lecture-rooms 
with bowed heads, the morning papers shaking 
in their hands. The accuracy of the Hebrew 
verb did not matter so much as it did last term. 
The homiletic uses or abuses of an applied text, 
the soundness of the new-school doctrine of 
free will, seemed less important to the universe 
than they were before the Flag went down on 
Sumter. Young eyes looked up at their 
instructors mistily, for the dawn of utter sacri 
fice was in them. He was only an Academy 
boy yesterday, or a theologue ; unknown, un 
noticed, saying his lesson in Xenophon, taking 
his notes on the Nicene Creed ; blamed a little, 
possibly, by his teacher or by his professor, for 
inattention. 

To-day he comes proudly to the desk. His 
step rings on the old, bare floors that he will 
never tread again. " Sir, my father gives his 
permission. I enlist at once." 

To-day he is a hero, and the hero's light is 
glorious on his face. To-day he is the teacher, 
and the professor learns lessons in his turn 
now. The boy whom he has lectured and 
scolded towers above him suddenly, a sacred 
thing to see. The old man stands uncovered 
before his pupil as they clasp hands and part. 

The drum calls on, and the boys drill bravely 
no boys parade this, but awful earnest now. 
The ladies of Andover sew red braid upon blue 
flannel shirts, with which the Academy Com 
pany make simple uniform. 

Then comes a morning when the professors 
cannot read the papers for the news they bring ; 
but cover streaming eyes with trembling hands, 
and turn their faces. For the black day of the 
defeat at Bull Run has darkened the summer 
sky. 

 

Andover does not sew for the missionaries 
now. Her poor married theologues must wait 
a little for their babies dresses. Even the blue 
flannel shirts for the drill are forgotten. The
