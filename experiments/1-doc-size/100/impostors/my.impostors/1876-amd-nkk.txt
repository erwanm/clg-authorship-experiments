 

This was cold and wearisome. Nelly was glad to rise, 
and followed the doctor's mother into the parlor. It had 
been furnished by the first Mrs. Kinnard, and was a rather 
strange medley. The carpet was dulled by the furniture 
(faded scarlet satin) ; and it seemed to have been some 
one's stud} r to crowd in it every thing ornamental that 
could be had. The walls were adorned with pictures in 
worsted-work, which had been Mrs. Kinnard's girlish 
passion. But "Rebecca at the Well" looked dingy in 
her faded attire, and little Moses was very red in the face, 
while the princess was brown. " Pocahontas rescuing 
Capt. John Smith " puzzled Nelly for a long while. 

Conversation languished. Dr. Kinnard plainly fidg 
eted. "When Nelly could endure the restraint no longer, 
she suddenly exclaimed, 

' ' Can we not go out and walk among the flowers ? It 
looks so tempting ! and the air is delightful." 

" Why, yes ; " and Dr. Kinnard rose with alacrity. 

"Will you not come?" said Nelly, holding out her 
hand to Maud in friendly overture. 

"No, I thank you," answered the precise little voice ; 
and she spread her ruffled skirts farther over the ottoman. 

Nelly took her husband's arm, and sprang lightly down 
the steps. 

Aunt Adelaide turned to Mrs. Kinnard as if she said, 
" There, I told you how it would be ! " 

" Can I go? " asked Bertie timidly. 

" Indeed you cannot. Do you suppose they would be 
bothered with you? I was glad to see you decline, Maud : 
she only asked you out of compliment. You must re 
member this, my dear, and not put yourself forward. 
Poor children ! You have lost your father as surely as if 
he were dead." 



CHAPTER IV. 

" We have a vision of our own, 
Ah, why should we undo it? " WOKDSWOKTH. 

THE house stood a hundred feet or so from the street. 
On one side was a chestnut-grove ; on the other flower, 
fruit, and vegetable gardens. It was on high ground, 
and at the back sloped quite precipitately, with an air of 
wildness. .A small stream ran through this, which was a 
favorite resort with the doctor, who wended his way to the 
brow of it with a familiar unconsciousness. 

' ' What an enchanting nook ! " and Nellie paused 
suddenly. 

" Do you like it? I am so glad! " with a sense of 
relief. " I am an old fogy, I suspect, although I have 
been so uncommonly frisky for a month ; and I was just 
wondering, Nelly ah, you are going to laugh at me." 

"And, like the children, ' you won't tell me just for 
that. ' But I am not going to laugh at you ; and I do want 
your confidence." 

She glanced up with a sweet frankness that won him to 
proceed. 

"I was just wondering whether I had any right to 
covet your youth and brightness, when I could give you 
so little in return." 

"Little! Do you call your love a small thing? Is it 
to be that tell me? " in her pretty, imperious manner. 

"God forbid ! " he answered solemnly. " It is the pas 
sion of my life." Then with a sudden change of color 

 

and tone, "But the house seems a dull cage to put you 
in, my darling. Will you show me how to make it 
brighter, like the home I took you from? " 

" Gladly, if I may. I shall want to spend half the 
summer in these enchanting woods. I have no sewing to 
do, and no parish-visiting : so I shall be as idle as a 
butterfly." 

" I shall take you out to drive with me. There are 
many pretty little villages around. Then there is a very 
passable library in town, to which I always subscribe, as a 
public-spirited citizen should. And there are some pleas
