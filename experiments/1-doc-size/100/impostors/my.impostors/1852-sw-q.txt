spoken.

"How does your uncle like farming?" said aunt Syra.

A home thrust, which Fleda parried by saying he had hardly got
accustomed to it yet.

"What's been his business? what has he been doing all his life
till now?" said the sewing-woman.

Fleda replied that he had had no business; and after the minds
of the company had had time to entertain this statement, she
was startled by Miss Lucy's voice at her elbow.

"It seems kind o' curious, don't it, that a man should live to
be forty or fifty years old, and not know anything of the
earth he gets his bread from?"

"What makes you think he don't?" said Miss Thornton, rather
tartly.

"She wa'n't speaking o' nobody," said aunt Syra.

"I was  I was speaking of man  I was speaking abstractly,"
said Fleda's right-hand neighbour.

"What's abstractly?" said Miss Anastasia, scornfully.

"Where do you get hold of such hard words, Lucy?" said Mrs.
Douglass.

"I don't know, Mis' Douglass, they come to me; it's practice,
I suppose. I had no intention of being obscure."

"One kind o' word 's as easy as another, I suppose, when
you're used to it, aint it?" said the sewing-woman.

"What's abstractly?" said the mistress of the house, again.

"Look in the dictionary, if you want to know," said her
sister.

"I don't want to know  I only want you to tell."

"When do you get time for it, Lucy? ha'n't you nothing else to
practise?" pursued Mrs. Douglass.

"Yes, Mis' Douglass; but then there are times for exertion,
and other times less disposable; and when I feel thoughtful or
low, I commonly retire to my room, and contemplate the stars,
or write a composition."

The sewing-woman greeted this speech with an unqualified ha!
ha! and Fleda involuntarily raised her head to look at the
last speaker; but there was nothing to be noticed about her,
except that she was in rather nicer order than the rest of the
Finn family.

"Did you get home safe last night?" inquired Miss Quackenboss,
bending forward over the quilt to look down to Fleda.

Fleda thanked her, and replied that they had been overturned,
and had several ribs broken.

"And where have you been, Fleda, all this while?" said Mrs.
Douglass.

Fleda told, upon which all the quilting party raised their
heads simultaneously, to take another review of her.

"Your uncle's wife aint a Frenchwoman, be she?" asked the
sewing-woman.

Fleda said, "Oh, no!" and Miss Quackenboss remarked, that "she
thought she wa'n't;" whereby Fleda perceived it had been a
subject of discussion.

"She lives like one, don't she?" said aunt Syra.

Which imputation Fleda also refuted to the best of her power.

"Well, don't she have dinner in the middle of the afternoon?"
pursued aunt Syra.

Fleda was obliged to admit that.

"And she can't eat without she has a fresh piece of roast meat
on table every day, can she?"

"It is not always roast," said Fleda, half vexed and half
laughing.

"I'd rather have a good dish o' bread and 'lasses, than the
hull on't," observed old Mrs. Finn, from the corner where she
sat, manifestly turning up her nose at the far-off joints on
Mrs. Rossitur's dinner-table.

The girls on the other side of the quilt again held counsel
together, deep and low.
