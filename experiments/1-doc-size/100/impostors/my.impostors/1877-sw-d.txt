don't want him nor nobody hangin' round all the time, 
Diana. There ain't nothin' to do ; only he forgot the 
winders, and I want to look out and see all my riches.' 

'Your riches, Mother Bartlett? ' And she was not going to live but a few days more. Diana wondered if her 
senses were wandering. But the old lady smiled ; the wise, 
sweet smile that Diana knew of old. 

' Whose be they, then ? ' she asked. 

' You mean, all this pretty summer day ? ' 

' Ain't it pretty ! And ain't the sunshine clear gold ? 
And ain't the sky a kind of an elegant canopy ? And it's 




all mine, and all it covers, and He that made it too ; and 
seein' what he makes, puts me in mind of how rich he is 
and what more he kin do. How's the baby ? ' 

For some little time the baby was talked of, in both 
present and future relations. 

' And you're very happy, Diana ? ' the old woman asked. 
' I hain't seen you now for quite a spell 'most all winter.' 

' I ought to be ' Diana answered, hesitating. 

' Some things folks does because they had ought to,' 
remarked the old lady, 'but bein' happy ain't one of 'em. 
The whole world had ought to be happy, if you put it so. 
The Lord wants 'em to be.' 

' Not happy ' said Diana hastily. 

' Yes. 'Tain't his fault if they ain't.' 

' How can he want everybody to be happy, when he 
makes them so unhappy ? ' 

' He ? the Lord ? He don't make nobody unhappy, 
child. How did that git in your head ? ' 

' Well it comes to the same thing, Mother Bartlett. He 
lets things happen.' 

' He hain't chained up Satan yet, if that's what you 
mean. But Satan can't do no harm to the Lord's children. 
He's tried, often enough, but the Lord wont let him.' 

' But Mother Bartlett, that's only a way of talking. I 
don't know if it is Satan does it, but every sort of terrible 
thing comes to them. How can you say it's not evil ? ' 

'Cause the good Lord turns it to blessing, dear. Or 
if he don't, it's 'cause they wont let him. O' course it is 
Satan does it Satan and his ministers. " Every good gift 
and every perfect gift cometh down from the Father of 
lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of 
turning." How should he be kind to-day and unkind to- 
morrow ? ' 



 

Diana could not trust her voice and was silent. The 
old woman looked at her, and said in a changed tone presently, 

' What's come to you, Diana Masters ? You had ought 
to be the happiest woman there is livin'.' 

Diana could not answer. 

' Ain't you, dear ? ' Mrs. Bartlett added tenderly. 

' I didn't mean to speak of myself,' Diana said, making 
a tremendous effort to bring out her words unconcernedly ; 
'but I get utterly puzzled sometimes, Mother Bartlett, 
when I see such things happen such things as do happen, 
and to good people too.' 

'You ain't the fust one that's been puzzled that way,' 
returned the old woman. ' Job was all out in his reckoning 
once, and David was as stupid as a beast, he says. But 
when chillen gets into the dark, they're apt to run agin 
sun'thin' and hurt theirselves. Stay in the light, dear.' 

' How can one, always ? ' 

' O child, jes' believe the Lord's word. That'll keep 
you near him ; and there is no darkness where he is.' 

' What is his word, that I must believe ? about this, I 
mean.' 

' That he loves us, dear ; loves us tender and true ; 
like you love your little baby, only a deal more ; and truer,
