The other Americans exchanged looks, and 
Elliott tried to check Clifford's folly before it 
was too late. 

"Espion!" muttered the Frenchman, adding, 
a little louder, "Sale Allemand!" 

Gethryn looked up startled. 

"Keep cool," whispered Thaxton; "if they 
think we are Germans we're done for." 

Carleton glanced nervously about. "How 
they stare, "he whispered. "Their eyes pop out 
of their heads as if they saw Bismarck." 

There was an ominous movement among the 
throng. 

"Vive T Anarchic! A bas les Prussiens!" yelled 
a beetle-browed Italian. A bas les etrangers!" 



 

"My friend," said Clifford, pleasantly,"you've  
got a very vile accent yourself." 

"You're a Prussian!" screamed the man., 

Every one was now looking at them. Geth- 
'gan to fume. 

Til thrash that cur if he says Prussian 
again," said he. 

"You'll keep quiet, that's what you'll do," 
growled Thaxton, looking anxiously at Rhodes. 

"Yes, you will!" said the Colossus, very pale. 

"Pig of a Prussian" shouted a fearful-looking 
hag, planting herself in front of Clifford, with 
arms akimbo, and head thrust forward. "Pig 
of a Prussian spy!" 

She glanced at her supporters, who promptly 
applauded. 

"Ah h h," she screamed, her little green 
eyes shining like a tiger's "Spy! German spy!" 

"Madam, "said Clifford, politely, "go and wash 
yourself." 

"Hold your cursed tongue, Clifford!" whis 
pered Thaxton. "Do you want to be torn to 
pieces?" 

Suddenly a man behind Gethryn sprang at 
his back, and then, amazed and terrified at hb 





own daring, yelled lustily for help. Gethryn 
shook him off as he would a fly, but the last 
remnant of self-control went at the same time, 
and, wheeling, he planted a blow square in the 
fellow's neck. The man fell like an ox. In an 
instant the mob was upon them. Thaxton received a heavy kick in the ribs, which sent him- 
reeling against Carleton. Clifford knocked 
two men down in as many blows, and, springing 
back, stood guard over Thaxton, until he could 
struggle to his feet again. Elliott got a sounding thwack on the nose, which he neatly returned, adding one on the eye for interest. 
Gethryn and Carleton fought back to back. 
Rhodes began by half strangling a son of the 
Commune and then flung him bodily among his 
howling compatriots. 

"Good Heavens," gasped Rhodes, "we can't 
keep this up!" And raising his voice, he cried 
with all the force of his lungs, "Help! This 
way, police!" A shot answered him, and 
a man, clapping his hands to his face, tilted 
heavily forward, the blood spurting between his 
fingers. 

Then a terrible cry arose, a din in which 



 

the Americans caught the clanging of steel and 
the neighing of horses. A man was hurled vio 
lently against Gethryn, who, losing in turn his 
balance, staggered and fell. Rising to his knees,
