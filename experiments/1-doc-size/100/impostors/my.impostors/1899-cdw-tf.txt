he said that you were the master boy to dream 
and moon around he ever saw." And she added, 
with a confidential and mischievous smile : " I 
think you'd better brought a switch along; it 
would save time." 

Phil had a great respect for his uncle Mait- 
land, but he feared him almost more than he 
feared the remote God of Abraham and Isaac. 
Mr. Maitland was not only the most prosperous 
man in all that region, but the man of the finest 
appearance, and a bearing that was equity itself. 
He was the first select-man of the town, and a 
deacon in the church, and however much he 
prized mercy in the next world he did not intend 
to have that quality interfere with justice in this 
world. Phil knew indeed that he was a man of 
God, that fact was impressed upon him at least 
twice a day, but he sometimes used to think it 
must be a severe God to have that sort of man. 
And he didn't like the curt way he pronounced 
the holy name â€” he might as well have called 
Job " job." 

Alice was as unlike her father, except in cer- 
tain race qualities of integrity and common-sense, 
as if she were of different blood. She was the 
youngest of five maiden sisters, and had arrived 
at the mature age of eighteen. Slender in figure, 





 

with a grace that was half shyness, soft brown 
hair, gray eyes that changed color and could as 
easily be sad as merry, a face marked with a 
moving dimple that every one said was lovely, 
retiring in manner and yet not lacking spirit 
nor a sly wit of her own. Now and then, yes, 
very often, out of some paradise, no doubt, strays 
into New England conditions of reticence and 
self-denial such a sweet spirit, to diffuse a breath 
of heaven in its atmosphere, and to wither like a 
rose ungathered. These are the New England 
nuns, not taking any vows, not self-consciously 
virtuous, apparently untouched by the vanities 
of the world. Marriage ? It is not in any girl's 
nature not to think of that, not to be in a flutter 
of pleasure or apprehension at the attentions of 
the other sex. Who has been able truly to read 
the thoughts of a shrinking maiden in the pass- 
ing days of her youth and beauty ? In this har- 
monious and unselfish household, each with de- 
cided individual character, no one ever intruded 
upon the inner life of the other. No confidences 
were given in the deep matters of the heart, no 
sign except a blush over a sly allusion to some 
one who had been "attentive." If you had 
stolen a look into the work-basket or the secret 
bureau - drawer, you might have found a treas- 
ured note, a bit of ribbon, a rose-bud, some token 
of tenderness or of friendship that was growing 




 

old with, the priestess who cherished it. Did 
they not love flowers, and pets, and had they 
not a passion for children ? Were there not 
moonlight evenings when they sat silent and 
musing on the stone steps, watching the shadows 
and the dancing gleams on the swift river, when 
the air was fragrant with the pink and the lilac ? 
Not melancholy this, nor poignantly sad, but 
having in it nevertheless something of the pathos 
of life unfulfilled. And was there not some- 
times, not yet habitually, coming upon these 
faces, faces plain and faces attractive, the shade 
of renunciation ? 

Phil loved Alice devotedly. She was his con- 
fidante, his defender, but he feared more the dis- 
approval of her sweet eyes when he had done 
wrong than the threatened punishment of his 
uncle. 

" I only meant to be gone just a little while," 
Phil went on to say. 

" And you were away the whole afternoon. 
It is a pity the days are so short. And you 
don't know what you lost." 

" No great, I guess."
