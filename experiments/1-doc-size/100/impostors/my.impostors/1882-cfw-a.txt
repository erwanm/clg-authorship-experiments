"I can not."

He pressed her hand in silence, opened the door, and led the way down to
the hall-room. They had been absent one hour.

Blum, who was standing disconsolately near the entrance, watching Helen,
came up and asked Anne to dance. Reluctant to go to her grandaunt before
it was necessary, she consented. She glanced nervously up and down the
long room as they took their places, but Heathcote was not present. Her
gaze then rested upon another figure moving through the dance at some
distance down the hall. Mrs. Lorrington in her costume that evening
challenged criticism. She did this occasionally--it was one of her
amusements. Her dress was of almost the same shade of color as her hair,
the hue unbroken from head to foot, the few ornaments being little stars
of topaz. Her shoulders and arms were uncovered; and here also she
challenged criticism, since she was so slight that in profile view she
looked like a swaying reed. But as there was not an angle visible
anywhere, her fair slenderness seemed a new kind of beauty, which all,
in spite of sculptor's rules, must now admire. Rachel called her,
smilingly, "the amber witch." But Isabel said, "No; witch-hazel; because
it is so beautiful, and yellow, and sweet." Rachel, Isabel, and Helen
always said charming things about each other in public: they had done
this unflinchingly for years.

Miss Vanhorn was watching her niece from her comfortable seat on the
other side of the room, and watching with some impatience. But the
Haunted Man was now asking Anne to dance, and Anne was accepting. After
that dance she went out on the piazza for a few moments; when she
returned, Heathcote was in the room, and waltzing with Helen.

All her courage left her before she could grasp it, and hardly knowing
what she was doing, she went directly across the floor to Miss Vanhorn,
and asked if she might go to her room.

Miss Vanhorn formed one of a majestic phalanx of old ladies. "Are you
tired?" she asked.

"Very tired," said Anne, not raising her eyes higher than the stout
waist before her, clad in shining black satin.

"She does look pale," remarked old Mrs. Bannert, sympathizingly.

"Anne is always sleepy at eight or nine, like a baby," replied Miss
Vanhorn, well aware that the dark-eyed Rachel was decidedly a
night-bird, and seldom appeared at breakfast at all; "and she has also a
barbarous way of getting up at dawn. Go to bed, child, if you wish; your
bowl of bread and milk will be ready in the morning." Then, as Anne
turned, she added: "You will be asleep when I come up; I will not
disturb you. Take a good rest." Which Anne interpreted, "I give you that
amount of time: think well before you act." The last respite was
accorded.

But even a minute is precious to the man doomed to death. Anne left the
ball-room almost with a light heart: she had the night. She shut herself
in her room, took off the lace dress, loosened her hair, and sat down by
the window to think. The late moon was rising; a white fog filled the
valley and lay thickly over the river; but she left the sash open--the
cool damp air seemed to soothe her troubled thoughts. For she knew--and
despised herself in the knowledge--that the strongest feeling in her
heart now was jealousy, jealousy of Helen dancing with Heathcote below.
Time passed unheeded; she had not stirred hand or foot when, two hours
later, there was a tap on her door. It was Helen.

"Do not speak," she whispered, entering swiftly and softly, and closing
the door; "the Grand Llama is coming up the stairs. I wanted to see you,
and I knew that if I did not slip in before she passed, I could not get
in without disturbing her. Do not stir; she will stop at your door and
listen."

They stood motionless; Miss Vanhorn's step came along the hall, and, as
Helen had predicted, paused at Anne's door. There was no light within,
and no sound; after a moment it passed on, entered the parlor, and then
the bedroom beyond.

"If Bessmer would only close the bedroom door," whispered Helen, "we
should be quite safe." At this moment the maid did close the door; Helen
gave a sigh of relief. "I never could whisper well," she said. "Only
cat-women whisper nicely. Isabel is a cat-woman. Now when it comes to a
murmur--a faint, clear, sweet murmur, I am an adept. I wonder if Isabel
will subdue her widower? You have been here long enough to have an
opinion. Will she?"

"I do not know," said Anne, wondering at her own ability to speak the
words.

"And I--do not care! I am tired, Crystal: may I lie on your bed? Do
close that deathly window, and come over here, so that we can talk
comfortably," said Helen, throwing herself down on the white coverlet--a
long slender shape, with its white arms clasped under its head. The
small room was in shadow. Anne drew a chair to the bedside and sat down,
with her back to the moonlight.

"This is a miserable world," began Mrs. Lorrington. Her companion,
sitting with folded arms and downcast eyes, mentally agreed with her.

"Of course you do not think so," continued Helen, "and perhaps, being
such a crystal-innocent, you will never find it out. There are such
souls. There are also others; and it is quite decided that I
hate--Rachel Bannert, who is one of them."
