"Then I guess I won't open the door," laughed Pearl. "Perhaps you won't
object to telling me what your business is in these parts."

"I can't do any thing till you let me out."

"Then you can't do any thing at all. You had better turn in, and take a
nap for the rest of the day."

"Do you mean to keep us in here all day, Hawlinshed?"

"Yes: and all night if you don't behave yourself."

Another silence followed, in which the caged officer was probably
considering what he should do next. It was broken by a sudden crash,
which startled Dory. He found that something besides the silence was
broken. All the blinds in one of the doors were smashed out at a single
stroke from the shoulder of the detective. It hurt Dory's feelings to
see the beautiful work of the boat reduced to splinters in an instant;
but he realized that he was in the midst of a stirring adventure, and
the blinds could be easily restored.

"Good!" exclaimed Pearl, as the opening appeared in the door. "You did
that very well, Peppers. I was wishing I could leave the helm long
enough to do it myself, for I wanted to see who the other fellow was
that had taken passage with me. Besides, I think it is a good deal more
sociable to see a man's face when you are talking to him."

"Of course you know, Hawlinshed, that you are resisting an officer, and
obstructing him in the discharge of his duty?" demanded Peppers,
beginning to be a little more demonstrative as he failed to appreciate
the humor of the new skipper.

"Of course I understand that I am obstructing an officer,--a New-York
officer over here in Vermont," chuckled Pearl. "By the way, Peppers,
have you such a thing about you as a pistol of any kind,--a revolver, a
seven-shooter, or any toy of this sort?"

"I haven't any such thing about me. If I had, I should shoot you the
next thing I did," answered Peppers petulantly.

"Oh, no! You wouldn't do such a thing as that. It might hurt me," said
Pearl with a laugh.

"That is to say"--continued Peppers; and it was plain to Dory that Moody
had indicated to him that he had made a blunder in telling the rascal
that he had no dangerous weapon.

"That is to say that you haven't any pistol, but the other fellow has
one," added Pearl. "By the way, who is the other fellow? It would be a
good deal more sociable if you would introduce him."

"His name is Moody, and he will be very glad to make your acquaintance,
Hawlinshed."

"If he has got a pistol, it might go off, and hurt one of you in that
narrow place; and I think you had better hand it out, and have it
properly taken care of," continued Pearl.

"Moody has four pistols, all of them seven-shooters," said the
detective, who seemed to be determined effectually to counteract the
influence of the blunder he had made.

"Four seven-shooters!" exclaimed Pearl. "He is a walking arsenal. He
would sink if he should fall overboard with such a weight of arms upon
him; and I think he had better pass them out through the hole you have
been so kind as to make."

"He concludes that he may want them, and he don't mean to fall
overboard," replied Peppers.

"All right! but let him be very careful with them; for pistols are
dangerous things in such a little hole as you now occupy," answered
Pearl, who was no simpleton, and was confident that Moody had no pistol,
to say nothing of four of them.

A silence of a full hour followed, for neither party seemed to have any
plan to act upon. It was plain enough to Dory that the new skipper had
discovered the presence of the detective on board of the boat, either
before or soon after he went into her himself. A little later he saw a
plaid overcoat lying on the forward deck. It was odd enough to betray
the identity of its owner, who had forgotten to take it into the cabin
with him.

It afterwards appeared that Moody had sneezed twice. This was the sound
the skipper heard; and it informed the later passenger that the cabin
was occupied, as the coat explained by whom. Two hours had elapsed since
the capture of the boat; and the Goldwing was off Cumberland Head,
hugging the Grand Isle shore.




CHAPTER XXI.

ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE CONTEST.


"Where are we now, Dory?" asked Peppers, appearing at the aperture in
the door, at which he had not been seen for the last half hour, though
