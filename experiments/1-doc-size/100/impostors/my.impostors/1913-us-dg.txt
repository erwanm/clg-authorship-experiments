"No," admitted Madame Dupont. 

"But then," whispered the nurse, haK 
to herself, "that's not natural." 

"Yes," the other hurried on, "it is be- 
cause the baby will have need of extra 
care. You will have to take more trouble; 
you will have to give it medicines; your 
task will be a little more delicate, a Httle 
more difficult." 

"Oh, yes; then it's so that I will be sure 
to take good care of her? I understand." 

"Then it's agreed?" exclaimed Madame 
Dupont, wdth rehef. 

"Yes, ma'am," said the nurse. 

"And you won't come later on to make 
reproaches to us? We understand one 
another clearly? We have warned you 
that the child is sick, and that you could 
catch the disease. Because of that, because 
of the special need of care which she has. 



 

we promise you five hundred francs at the 
end of the nursing. That's all right, is it?'' 

''But; my lady," cried the nurse, all her 
cupidity awakened, ''you spoke just now 
of a thousand francs." 

"Very well, then, a thousand francs." 

George passed behind the nurse and got 
his mother by the arm, drawing her to 
one side. "It would be a mistake," he 
whispered, "if we did not make her sign 
an agreement to all that." 

His mother turned to the nurse. "In 
order that there may be no misunder- 
standing about the sum — you see how it is, 
I had forgotten already that I had spoken 
of a thousand francs — 'we will draw up a 
Httle paper, and you, on your part, will 
write one for us." 

"Very good, ma'am," said the nurse, 
delighted with the idea of so important a 
transaction. "Why, it's just as you do 
when you rent a house!" 

"Here comes the doctor," said the other. 
"Come, nurse, it is agreed?" 

"Yes, ma'am," was the answer. But 
all the same, as she went out she hesitated 



 

and looked sharply first at the doctor, and 
then at George and his mother. She 
suspected that something was wrong, and 
she meant to find out if she could. 

The doctor seated himself in George's 
office chair, as if to write a prescription. 
''The child's condition remains the same," 
he said; ''nothing disturbing." 

''Doctor," said Madame Dupont, gravely, 
''from now on, you will be able to devote 
your attention to the baby and the nurse 
without any scruple. During your absence 
we have arranged matters nicely. The 
nurse has been informed about the situation, 
and she does not mind. She has agreed 
to accept an indemnity, and the amount 
has been stated." 

But the doctor did not take these tidings 
as the other had hoped he might. He 
replied: ''The malady which the nurse 
will almost inevitably contract in feeding 
the child is too grave in its consequences. 
Such consequences might go as far as 
complete helplessness, even as far as death. 
So I say that the indemnity, whatever it 
might be, would not pay the damage."
