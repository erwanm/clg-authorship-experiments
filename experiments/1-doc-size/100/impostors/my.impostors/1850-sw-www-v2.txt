" do you ? let's hear it, George," cried the girls. 

" I don't believe it is good for anything if it is out of the 
Bible," said Margaret. " Now stare, Ellen Chauncey, do !" 

"I aint staring," said Ellen indignantly, — "but I don't believe it is right to play it, if it is out of the Bible." 

" Well it is though," said George. " Now listen ; — I'll 
think of somebody in the Bible, — some man or woman, you 
know ; and you all may ask me twenty questions about him 
to see if you can find out who it is." 

" What kind of questions ?" 

" Any kind of questions — whatever you like." 

" That will improve your knowledge of scripture history," 
said Gilbert. 

" To be sure ; and exercise oui* memory,'' said Isabel 
Hawthorn. 

" Yes, and then we are thinking of good people and what 
they did, all the time," said little Ellen. 

" Or bad people and what they did," said William. 

" But I don't know enough about people and things in the 
Bible," said Margaret ; " I couldn't guess." 

" never mind — it will be all the more fun," said George. 
" Come ! let's begin. Who'll take somebody ?" 







"I think this will be fine !" said little Chauncey but 
Ellen — where's Ellen? — we want her." 

" No we don't want her ! — we've enough without her — 
she won't play !" shouted William, as the little girl ran up 
stairs. She persevered however. Ellen had left her sofa before this, and was found seated on the foot of her bed. As 
far and as long as she could she withstood her little friend's 
entreaties, and very unwilhngly at last yielded and went with 
her down stairs. 

" Now we are ready," said little Ellen Chauncey ; " I have 
told Ellen what the game is ; who's going to begin ?" 

" We have begun," said William. " Gilbert has thought 
of somebody. Man or woman ?" 

-Man." 

" Young or old ?" 

" Why — he was young first and old afterwards." 

" Pshaw, William ! what a ridiculous question," said his 
sister. " Besides you mustn't ask m,ore than one at a time. 
Rich or poor, Gilbert ?" 

" Humph ! — why I suppose he was moderately well off. I 
dare say I should think myself a lucky fellow if I had as 
much." 

" Are you answering truly, Gilbert ?" 
" Upon my honor !" 

" Was he in a high or low station of life," asked Miss Hawthorn ?" 

" Neither at the top nor the bottom of the ladder — a very 
respectable person indeed.'' 

" But we are not getting on," said Margaret ; " according 
to you he wasn't anything in particular ; what kind of a 
person was he, Gilbert ?" 

" A very good man." 

" Handsome or ugly ?" 

" History don't say." 

" Well, what does it say ?" said George — " what did ho 
do ?" 

" He took a journey once upon a time." 
"What for'?" 

"Do you mean why he went, or what was the object of 
his going ?" 

" Why the one's the same as the other, aint it ?"
