face prepared not to give way. His first look had like to 
overset it all. 

" Ellie !" said he ; — I thought everybody was gone. My 
dear Ellie ! 

Ellen could hardly stand the tone of these three words, and 
she bore with the greatest difficulty the kiss that followed 
them ; it took but a word or two more, and a glance at the 
old look and smile, to break down entirely all her guard. 
According to her usual fashion she was rushing away ; but 
John held her fast, and though gently drew her close to him. 

" I will not let you forget that I am your brother, Ellie," 
said he. 

Ellen hid her face on his shoulder and cried as if she had 
never cried before. 

" Ellie," said he after a while, speaking low and tenderly, 
" the Bible says, * We have known and believed the love that 
God hath toward us — have you remembered and believed 
this lately ?" 

Ellen did not answer. 

" Have you remembered that God loves every sinner that 
has believed in his dear Son ? — and loves them so well that 
he will let nothing come near them to harm them ? — and 
loves them never better than when he sends bitter trouble on 
them ? It is wonderful ! but it is true. Have you thought 
of this, Ellie ?" 

She shook her head. 

" It is not in anger he does it ; — it is not that he has forgotten you ; — it is not that he is careless of your trembling 
little heart, — never, never ! If you are his child, all is done 
in love and shall work good for you ; and if we often cannot 
see how, it is because we are weak and foolish, and can see 
but a very little way." 

Ellen listened, with her face hid on his shoulder. 

" Do you love Christ, Ellen ?" 

She nodded, weeping afresh. 

" Do you love him less since he has brought you into this 
great sorrow ?" 

" No," sobbed Ellen ; — " more.'" 

He drew her closer to his breast, and was silent a little 
while. 







" I am very glad to hear you say that ! — then all wili be 
well. And haven't you the best reason to think that all is 
well with your dear mother ?" 

Ellen almost shrieked. Her mother's name had not been 
spoken before her in a great while, and she could hardly 
bear to hear it now. Her whole frame quivered with hysterical sobs. 

Hush, Ellie !" said John, in a tone that, low as it was, 
somehow found its way through all her agitation, and calmed 
her like a spell ; — " have you not good reason to beheve that 
all is well with her ?" 

" yes ! — oh yes !" 
She loved and trusted him too ; and now she is with him —
she has reached that bright home where there is no more sin, 
nor sorrow, nor death." 

" Nor parting either," sobbed Ellen, whose agitation was 
excessive. 

" ISTor parting ! — and though we are parted from them, it 
is but for a little ; let us watch and keep our garments clean, 
and soon we shall be all together, and have done with tears 
for ever. She has done with them now. — Did you hear from 
her again ?" 

Oh no ! — not a word !" 

" That is a hard trial. — But in it all, believe, dear 'Ellie, 
the love that God hath toward us ; — remember that our dear 
Saviour is near us, and feels for us, and is the same at all 
times. — And don't cry so, Ellie." 

He kissed her once or twice, and begged her to calm herself. For it seemed as if Ellen's very heart was flowing away 
in her tears ; yet they were gentler and softer far than at the 
beginning. The conversation had been a great relief. The 
silence between her and Alice on the thing always in her 
mind, a silence neither of them dared to break, had grown
