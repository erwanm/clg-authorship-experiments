" I never saw her," he said, " so cheerful. The 
more sickness there is, the more radiant she is. I 
don't mean," he added, laughing, " in apparel. 
Apparently she never thinks of herself, and posi- 
tively she seems to take no time to eat or sleep. I 
encounter her everywhere. I doubt if she ever 
sits down, except when she drops in at the mission 





chapel now and then, and sits quite unmoved on a 
bench by the door during vespers." 

" Then she does go there ?" said Edith. 

"That is a queer thing. She would promptly 
repudiate any religious interest. But I tell her 
she is a bit of a humbug. When I speak about 
her philanthropic zeal, she says her interest is 
purely scientific." 

" Anyway, I believe," Jack put in, " that women 
doctors are less mercenary than men. I dare say 
they will get over that when the novelty of com- 
ing into the profession has worn off." 

" That is possible," said Father Damon ; " but 
that which drives women into professions now is 
the desire to do something rather than the desire 
to make something. Besides, it is seldom, in their 
minds, a finality ; marriage is always a possibility." 

" Yes," replied Edith, " and the probability of 
having to support a husband and family ; then 
they may be as mercenary as men are." 

" Still, the enthusiasm of women," Father Da- 
mon insisted, " in hospital and out - door practice, 
the singleness of their devotion to it, is in contrast 
to that of the young men -doctors. And I notice 
another thing in the city : they take more interest 
in philanthropic movements, in the condition of 
the poor, in the labor questions ; they dive eager- 
ly into philosophic speculations, and they are more 
aggressively agnostics. And they are not afraid 





of any social theories. I have one friend, a skilful 
practitioner they tell me, a linguist, and a metaphy- 
sician, a most agreeable and accomplished woman, 
who is in theory an extreme nihilist, and looks to 
see the present social and political order upset." 

" I don't see," Jack remarked, " what women es- 
pecially are to gain by such a revolution." 

"Perhaps independence, Jack," replied Edith. 
" You should hear my club of working-girls, who 
read and think much on these topics, talk of these 
things." 

" Yes," said Father Damon, " you toss these top- 
ics about, and discuss them in the magazines, and 
fancy you are interested in socialistic movements. 
But you have no idea how real and vital they are, 
and how the dumb discontent of the working classes 
is being formulated into ideas. It is time we tried 
to understand each other." 

Not all the talk was of this sort at the Golden 
House. There were three worlds here that of 
Jack, to which Edith belonged by birth and tradi- 
tion and habit ; that of which we have spoken, to 
which she belonged by profound sympathy ; and 
that of Father Damon, to which she belonged by 
undefined aspiration. In him was the spiritual 
element asserting itself in a mediaeval form, in a 
struggle to mortify and deny the flesh and yet 
take part in modern life. Imagine a celibate and 
ascetic of the fifteenth century, who knew that 







Paradise must be gained through poverty and pri- 
vation and suffering, interesting himself in the 
tenement-house question, in labor leagues, and the 
single tax ! 

Yet, hour after hour, in those idle summer days, 
when nature was in a mood that suggested grace
