occupation and swinging the old door slowly between her two 
hands. 

' If I will let you ! ' repeated Greif. ' Do you think I would 
try to prevent you from saying what you please, darling ' 

' You ought to, if you think it would be a mistake at least, 
after we are married.' 

' I am not sure that I could,' he answered with a laugh. 

' No one else could,' said Hilda, looking up at him with flashing 



 

eyes. ' If I meant to do a thing, I would do it, of course. Did I 
not say that I would not let you go ? ' 

' Indeed you did. And you kept your word.' 

' And I love you you know it ? ' 

' It is all I know, or care to know.' 

' Well, I will tell you something more. Because I love you, I 
want to do what you like, and not what I like, and I always will, 
so long as you love me.' 

Greif drew her to him and held her close, and whispered a 
tender word into her ear. 

' But you must understand,' she said. ' It is not because you are 
to be my husband, that I mean to submit to you. I do not submit 
at all, and never shall. I am just as strong as you are, and you 
could not make me yield a hair's-breadth. But I will always do 
everything you wish me to do, because I love you, and because you 
love me, not for any other reason. Do you understand ? ' 

' I would not have it otherwise, my darling and I will do the 
same 

' You cannot quite you cannot feel as I do, Greif. Perhaps, 
some day when you and I are old, Greif then you will love me 
as I love you now, but then, you see, I shall have learnt how to 
love you more, and you will still be hindmost in love's race -for 
women are made to love and men to fight, in this world, and 
though I could fight not badly, if need were, for you, yet I know 
better how to do the sweeter thing, than you can ever know. Do 
you not believe me ? ' 

' Since you would have me 

'You do not but you will, some day,' she answered, shaking 
her beautiful head a little, and tapping the door with her fingers. 
' And now, dear,' she added, laying her hand in his and beginning 
to walk up and down the old battlement, 'and now, shall I 
tell Rex, or will you ? ' 

I will tell him,' said Greif firmly. 

' Then promise me not to be angry, Greif. I could do it so 
well but it is better so. Promise me that you will say it in such 
a way as shall make you feel afterwards that you have done the 
best even long afterwards ; in such a way as to show him how 
you value his friendship. He saved your life, by his care 

' And you called me back from death with your eyes 

'Do not think of my eyes, when you are talking to him,' 
interrupted Hilda gravely. ' Think of all he has done for you, and 
of what such a noble friendship deserves in return. Think that 
he is a lonely man, and not so young as you, and that he needs a 





little affection very much. Think that all I want is that we may 
be able to live happily together, you and I, and he, when he cares 
to be with us. But do not think of me or if you do, think that 
if you and Rex were parted I should not forgive myself. Do I 
not owe him your life, as you do ? If you had died, because he 
was not there to tend you - I cannot speak of it but you owe 
him much, for it is your life, and I more, for I owe him our two 
lives together. Will you tell him that ? ' 

' I will try he will not understand it all.' 

' Then, if he has not understood, if you cannot make him see it, 
then it will be my turn. But you can, Greif dear, I know you can. 
And it is not a small matter either, though it may seem so now. 
It is not a small matter to part with such a man as that, nor is it 
an insignificant evil, that I should have his dislike at the very 
beginning, before we are married. You must do your best, you 
must do all you can, and you will succeed and by and by we will 
work together. Greif -' she stopped suddenly and looked at him. 

' What is it, dear ? ' he asked.
