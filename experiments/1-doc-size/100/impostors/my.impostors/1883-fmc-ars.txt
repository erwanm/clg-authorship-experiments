on goats milk in the mountains and that if he has 
brains enough, or talent enough, he may marry any 
woman he likes without ever thinking whether she 
is noble or not. De Pretis must be old-fashioned, 
for I am sure I do not think in that way, and I know 
a hundred times as much as he a hundred times. 

I suppose it must have been the very day when 
Nino had been to De Pretis in the morning, that he 
had instructions to go to the house of Count von Lira 
on the morrow; for I remember very well that Nino 
acted strangely in the evening, singing and making 



 

a noise for a few minutes, and then burying himself 
in a book. However that may be, it was very soon 
afterwards that he went to the Palazzo Carmandola, 
dressed in his best clothes, he tells me, in order to 
make a favourable impression on the count. The 
latter had spoken to De Pretis about the lessons in 
literature, to which he attached great importance, 
and the maestro had turned the idea to account for 
his pupil. But Nino did not expect to see the young 
contessa on this first day, or at least he did not hope 
he should be able to speak to her. And so it turned 
out. 

The footman, who had a red waistcoat and opened 
the door with authority, as if ready to close it again 
on the smallest provocation, did not frighten Nino 
at all, though he eyed him suspiciously enough, and 
after ascertaining his business departed to announce 
him to the count. Meanwhile Nino, who was very 
much excited at the idea of being under the same 
roof with the object of his adoration, sat himself 
down on one of the carved chests ranged round the 
hall. The green baize door at the other end swung 
noiselessly on its hinges, closing itself behind the 
servant, and the boy was left alone. He might well 
be frightened, if not at the imposing appearance of 
the footman, at least at the task he had undertaken. 
But a boy like Nino is afraid of nothing, when he is 
in love, and he simply looked about him, realising 
that he was without doubt in the house of a gran
signore, and from time to time brushing a particle of 
dust from his clothes, or trying to smooth his 
black hair, which he had caused to be clipped a littJe 



 

for the occasion; a very needless expense, for he 
looks better with his hair long. 

Before many moments the servant returned, and 
with some condescension said that the count awaited 
him. Nino would rather have faced the mayor, or 
the king himself, than Graf von Lira, though he 
was not at all frightened he was only very much 
excited, and he strove to calm himself, as he was 
ushered through the apartments to the small sitting- 
room, where he was expected. 

Graf von Lira, as I have already told you, is a 
foreigner of rank, who had been a Prussian colonel, 
and was wounded in the war of  He is very 
tall, very thin, and very grey, with wooden features 
and a huge moustache which stands out like the beaks 
on the colonna rostrata. His eyes are small and very 
far apart, and fix themselves with terrible severity 
when he speaks, even if he is only saying "good- 
morning." His nails are very long and most care 
fully kept, and though he is so lame that he could 
not move a step without the help of his stick, he is 
still an upright and military figure. I remember 
well how he looked, for he came to see me under 
peculiar circumstances, many months after the time 
of which I am now speaking; and besides, I had 
stood next to him for an hour in the chapel of the 
choir in St. Peter's. 

He speaks Italian intelligibly, but with the stran 
gest German constructions, and he rolls the letter 
curiously in his throat. But he is an intelligent 
 man for a soldier, though he thinks talent is a matter 
o education, and education a matter of drill. He is 



 

the most ceremonious man I ever saw ; and Nino says 
he rose from his chair to meet him, and would not sit 
down again until Nino was seated.
