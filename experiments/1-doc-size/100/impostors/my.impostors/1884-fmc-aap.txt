"On the contrary," said John, "I am very enthusiastic. It is the best
thing that could possibly have happened."

"Then go and do likewise," returned Mrs. Sam, laughing. Then she changed
her tone. "There is a young lady here who will be very glad to see you. Go
and try and cheer her up a little, can't you?"

"Who is that?"

"A young lady over there--close to Sybil-dressed in white with roses.
Don't you see? How stupid you are! There--the second on the left."

"Do you mean to say that is Miss Thorn?" exclaimed John in much surprise,
and looking where Mrs. Sam directed him. "Good Heavens! How she has
changed!"

"Yes, she has changed a good deal," said Mrs. Wyndham, looking at John's
face.

"I hardly think I should have known her," said John. "She must have been
very ill; what has been the matter?"

"The matter? Well, perhaps if you will go and speak to her, you will see
what the matter is," answered Mrs. Sam, enigmatically.

"What do you mean?" John looked at his companion in astonishment.

"I mean just exactly what I say. Go and talk to her, and cheer her up a
little." She dropped her voice, and spoke close to Harrington's ear--"No
one else in the world can," she added.

John's impulse was to answer Mrs. Wyndham sharply. What possible right
could she have to say such things? It was extremely bad taste, if it was
nothing worse, even with an old friend like John. But he checked the words
on his lips and spoke coldly.

"It is not fair to say things like that about any girl," he answered. "I
will certainly go and speak to her at once, and if you will be good enough
to watch, you will see that I am the most indifferent of persons in her
eyes."

"Very well, I will watch," said Mrs. Wyndham, not in the least
disconcerted. "Only take care."

John smiled quietly, and made his way through the crowd of gaily-dressed,
laughing people to here Joe was standing. She had not yet caught sight of
him, but she knew he was in the room, and she felt very nervous. She
intended to treat him with friendly coolness, as a protest against her
conduct in former days.

Poor Joe! she was very miserable, but she had made a brave effort. Her
pale cheeks and darkened eyes contrasted painfully with the roses she
wore, and her short nervous remarks to those who spoke to her sounded very
unlike her former self.

"How do you do, Miss Thorn?" John said, very quietly. "It is a long time
since we met."

Joe put her small cold hand in his, and it trembled so much that John
noticed it. She turned her head a little away from him, frightened now
that he was at last come.

"Yes," she said in a low voice, "it is a long time." She felt herself turn
red and then pale, and as she looked away from John she met Mrs. Wyndham's
black eyes turned full upon her in an inquiring way. She started as though
she had been caught in some wrong thing; but she was naturally brave, and
after the first shock she spoke to John more naturally.

"We seem destined for festivities, Mr. Harrington," she said, trying to
laugh. "We parted at a ball, and we meet again at a wedding."

"It is always more gay to meet than to part," answered John. "I think this
is altogether one of the gayest things I ever saw. What a splendid fellow
your cousin is. It does one good to see men like that."

"Yes, Ronald is very good-looking," said Joe. "I am so very glad, you do
not know; and he is so happy."

"Any man ought to be who marries such a woman," said John. "By the bye,"
he added with a smile, "Vancouver takes it all very comfortably, does he
not? I would like to know what he really feels."

"I am sure that whatever it is, it is something bad," said Joe.

"How you hate him!" exclaimed John with a laugh.

"I--I do not hate him. But you ought to, Mr. Harrington. I simply despise
him, that is all."

"No, I do not hate him either," answered John. "I would not disturb my
peace of mind for the sake of hating any one. It is not worth while."

Some one came and spoke to Joe, and John moved away in the crowd, more
disturbed in mind than he cared to acknowledge. He had gone to Joe's side
in the firm conviction that Mrs. Wyndham was only making an untimely jest,
and that Joe would greet him indifferently. Instead she had blushed,
turned paler, hesitated in her speech, and had shown every sign of
confusion and embarrassment. He knew that Mrs. Wyndham was right, after
all, and he avoided her, not wishing to give a fresh opportunity for
making remarks upon Joe's manner.
