"Why?" Fleda said, with a look up at him, at once a little
startled and a little curious  "what makes you say so?"

"Because  pardon me  you did not read it."

"Oh," said Fleda, laughing, but colouring at the same time
very frankly, "I can tell how I like some things without
reading them very carefully."

Mr. Carleton looked at her, and then took the magazine again.

"What have you there, Mr. Carleton?" said Florence.

"A piece of English, on which I was asking this lady's
opinion, Miss Evelyn."

"Now, Mr. Carleton," exclaimed Constance, jumping up  "I am
going to ask you to decide a quarrel between Fleda and me
about a point of English "

"Hush, Constance!" said her mother  "I want to speak to Mr.
Carleton. Mr. Carleton, how do you like it?"

"Like what, Mamma?" said Florence.

"A piece I gave Mr. Carleton to read. Mr. Carleton, tell me
how you like it, Sir."

"But what is it, Mamma!"

"A piece of poetry in an old Excelsior  'The Spirit of the
Fireside.' Mr. Carleton, wont you read it aloud, and let us
all hear? but tell me, first, what you think of it."

"It has pleased me particularly, Mrs. Evelyn."

"Mr. Stackpole says he does not understand it, Sir."

"Fanciful," said Mr. Stackpole; "it's a little fanciful  and
I can't quite make out what the fancy is."

"It has been the misfortune of many good things before, not to
be prized, Mr. Stackpole," said the lady, funnily.

"True, Ma'am," said that gentleman, rubbing his chin, "and the
converse is also true, unfortunately, and with a much wider
application."

"There is a peculiarity of mental development or training,"
said Mr. Carleton, "which must fail of pleasing many minds,
because of their wanting the corresponding key of nature or
experience. Some literature has a hidden free-masonry of its
own."

"Very hidden, indeed!" said Mr. Stackpole; "the cloud is so
thick that I can't see the electricity."

"Mr. Carleton," said Mrs. Evelyn, laughing, "I take that
remark as a compliment, Sir; I have always appreciated that
writer's pieces; I enjoy them very much."

"Well, wont you, please, read it, Mr. Carleton?" said
Florence, "and let us know what we are talking about."

Mr. Carleton obeyed, standing where he was, by the centre-
table.


"By the old hearthstone a Spirit dwells,
The child of bygone years 
He lieth hid the stones amid,
And liveth on smiles and tears.


"But when the night is drawing on,
And the fire burns clear and bright,
He cometh out and walketh about
In the pleasant grave twilight.


"He goeth round on tiptoe soft,
And scanneth close each face;
If one in the room be sunk in gloom,
By him he taketh his place.


"And then with fingers cool and soft
(Their touch who does not know?)
With water brought from the well of thought,
That was dug long years ago,


"He layeth his hand on the weary eyes 
They are closed and quiet now; 
And he wipeth away the dust of the day
Which had settled on the brow.


"And gently then he walketh away
