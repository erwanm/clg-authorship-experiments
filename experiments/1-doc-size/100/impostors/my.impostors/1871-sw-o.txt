" Yes, there is. People ought to hear the 
truth." 



 

" But if you know what is right, why don't 
you do it, Maria ? " 

I do as well as I can." 

" But Maria ! I mean, about what you 
were saying ; giving up whatever is not right." 

" Things are right for other people, that 
are not right for members of the church. 
That's why I want to wait awhile. I am 
not ready." 

" But Maria what makes them right for 
other people ? " 

" They have not promised anything about 
them. Clarissa has ytromised, and she don't 
do." 

" You have not promised." 

" No, of course I haven't." 

" But if they are right things, Maria, why 
should you, or anybody, promise not to have 
anything to do with them ? " 

" O you are too wise, Matilda ! " her 
sister answered impatiently. " There is no 
need for you to go to read with aunt Candy ; 
you know everything already." 



 

The rest of the morning was very silent 
between the sisters, till it came to the time 
for Matilda to present herself in her aunt's 
room. There meanwhile a consultation had 
been held. 

"Mamma, that girl is getting unendurable." 

" Must wait a little while, my dear." 

" What will you do with her then ? " 

" Something. I can send her to school, at 
any rate." 

" But the expense, mamma ? " 

" It is not much, at the district school. 
That is where she has been going 

Matilda too ?" 

" I suppose that will be the best place. I 
am not sure about sending Matilda. She's 
a fine child." 

" She will be handsome, mamma." 

" She is very graceful now. She has a 
singular manner." 

" But she is spoiled, mamma!" 

" I shall un-spoil her. Tilly is very young 
yet, and she has not had enough to do. I 



 

shall give her something else to think of, and 
get these absurdities out of her head. She 
just wants something to do." 

" Mamma, she is not an easy child to in 
fluence. She says so little and keeps her 
own counsel. I think you don't know her." 

" I never saw the child yet that was a 
match for me," said Mrs. Candy complacently. 
" I like best one that has some stuff in her. 
Maria is a wet sponge ; you can squeeze her 
dry in a minute  no character, no substance. 
Matilda is different. I should like to keep 
Tilly."
