such books nor write them. I was bom with a passion 
for English and the subtler psychology. I should be 
hopeless from any editor's or publisher's standpoint if 
I didn't happen to have been fitted out with a strong 
sense of drama. If I could only set my stage with commonplace people no doubt I'd make a roaring hit. But 
I can't and I won't. Who has such a chance as an 
author to get away from commonplace people? Fancy 
deliberately concocting new ones!" 



 

"Not you! But you'll have some sort of success, all 
the same." 

"Yes, there are publics. Perhaps I'll hypnotize one 
of them. As for the financial end, what I hope is that 
the book will give me a position that will raise my prices 
in the magazines." 

"You could live abroad very cheaply." Alexina 
raised her eyes a trifle and looked as guileless as her 
words. 

"Oh, be sure I'll go to Europe and stay there for 
years as soon as I see my way ahead. I should find 
color in the very stones of the vUlage streets." 

"I am told that you can find most comfortable quar- 
ters in some of those English village inns, and for next 
to nothing. By the way, do you still correspond with 
that Englishman who was here during the fire?" 

' ' Gathbroke ? Off and on. I send him my stories and 
he writes a humorous sort of criticism of each ; says that 
as I have no humor he feels a sort of urge to apply a 
little somewhere." 

"How interesting. He didn't strike me as humorous." 

"I fancy he wasn't more than about one-fifth developed when he was here. Men like that, with his advantages, go ahead very rapidly when they get into their 
stride. He has already developed from business into 
politics — he is in Parliament — and that is the second 
long stride he has taken in the past seven years." 

"How interesting it will be for you two to meet 
again." Alexina spoke with languid politeness. 

Gora shrugged her shoulders. "If we do." She 
might not be able to show the under-white of her eyes 
and look like a seraph, but she had her voice, her features, under perfect control, and she had never been 
quick to blush. She did not suspect that Alexina was 
angling, but the very sound of Gathbroke 's name was 
enough to put up her guard. 

"You must have had several proposals, Gora dear. 
Your profession is almost as good as a matrimonial 
bureau. And you look too fetching for words in that 
uniform and cap." 

"I've had just two proposals. One was from an old 



 

rancher who liked the way I turned him over in bed and 
rubbed his back. The other was — well, a nice fellow, 
and quite well off. But I'm not keen on marrying any 
one." 

"Still, if it gave you that much more independence 
and leisure . . . travel ... a wider life. ..." 

"I'd only consider marrying for two reasons: If I 
met a man who had the power to make me quite mad 
about him, or one who could give me a great position in 
the world and was not wholly obnoxious. Otherwise, 
I prefer to trot alone. Why not? At least I escape 
monotony; I have what after all is the most precious 
thing in life, complete personal freedom; and if I succeed with my writing I can see the world and attain to 
position without the aid of any man. If I don't, I don't, 
and that is the end of it. I 'm a bit of a fatalist, I think, 
although to be sure when I want a thing badly enough 
I forget all about that aud fight like the devil. ' ' 

Alexina looked at the square face of her strange sister- 
in-law, so unlike her brother; at the high cheek bones, 
the heavy low brows over the cold light eyes, the powerful jaw, the wide firm but mobile mouth. 

"Have you any Eussian blood?" she asked. " 'Way 
back?" 

"Not that I know of. But after all I know little 
about my family, outside of the one ancestor that anchors 
us in the Revolutionary era. He or his son or his son's 
son may have married a Eussian or a Mongolian for all 
I know. Perhaps some one of my old aunts may have 
worked out a family tree in cross-stitch, but if so I never
