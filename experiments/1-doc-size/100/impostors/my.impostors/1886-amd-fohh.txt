She has never remarked it before, but there certainly is a 
curious suggestion of Lloyd in the baby's face to-day, just 
as she catches glimpses of Basil's imperious dignity in her 
own boy's countenance. If there were more children, — 
a merry houseful ; and she almost utters aloud the cov- 
eting cry that is in her soul. Lloyd belongs so exclu- 
sively to the Elms, and little girls would be so pretty to 
dress and to train, to grow up to girlhood, womanhood, 
to flit about like happy birds, to dance and sing, to have 
lovers — and oh ! she knows she should never hurry them 
in their soul's election. 

A tear falls on the baby's hand. Is she actually crying 
over a day dream ? 

" I think Mrs. Wentworth is making ready for a jour- 
ney," Rose says, rather hesitatingly, as they are nearing 
home. 

"Is she?" Doris is so preoccupied with her own 
thoughts that Mrs. Basil's journey cannot be of the 
slightest moment to her. The tone does not encourage 
any further confidence. 

It occurs to Doris when evening comes that it has been 
the longest day she has ever known. A vague depression 
has hung about her, a secret weariness and dissatisfaction, 
a something that if she was happy might be impending 
evil, but she has nothing to lose save her boy, and oh ! 
cruel compensation, that would be Basil Wentworth's 
gain. Judge Minturn scolds him roundly for working so 
hard, — he will make an old man of himself before middle 
life. Curiously enough, he will not touch a penny gained 
by his care of the estate, honorably earned, set aside by 
Lloyd's will for him. How keen a stab this has been to 
Doris, since by a kind of accident she learned it, not even 
Judge Mintm-n can understand. 

Just in the edge of the evening Doris bethinks herself 
of a neighborly errand, and throwing a delicate scarf 



 



 



 

about her, she runs out. She has grown so fearless that 
it seems puerile to call the maid to attend her. When 
she starts homeward again, she refuses the proffered 
escort, and daintily threads her way along. The voices 
of the night fill all the air with sound in every imaginable 
key. The falling dews make the night ten times sweeter 
than the day. Great golden stars shine through the 
interstices of the trees, but there is no moon. Oh, soft, 
fragrant night! A '' Jessica" night, as Lloyd used to 
say, but for the absence of the silver radiance, and a 
sudden rush of tears blinds her eyes. 

Some one comes softly huiTying along, — a tall figure 
with a familiar motion, — and she glances up as she turns 
the corner, under a large tree. 

In one of those swift, overwhelming presentiments she 
stretches out both hands as if she could snatch him from 
impending evil. While she has seemed to live over her 
whole life with every one else to-day, she has scarcely 
thought of Graham. 

"Doris! what are you doing here?" Graham Went- 
worth demands, in a strained, husky voice, as he takes 
both of the small, soft hands. How curiously cool and 
restful they are in this mad, hurrying whirl ! 

" And you — why have you returned? " she asks. 

Back of her question a formless something eludes her. 
Somewhere she has missed the clew to it ; she is certain 
she has once held it in her hands. 

"A forgotten errand." He laughs with a kind of
