the things she felt as if they were snatches of old play-books, 
and really felt them the more because they sounded so well. 
This however didn't prevent them from being as good feelings 
as those of anybody else, and at the moment Sherringham, to 
still a rising emotion which he knew he shouldn't still 
articulated the challenge I have just recorded, she seemed 
to him to have at any rate the truth of gentleness and 
generosity. 

"There's something the matter with you you're jealous," 
said Miriam. " You're jealous of Mr. Dormer. That's an 
example of the way you tangle everything up. Lord, he 
won't hurt you, nor me either ! " 

" He can't hurt me, my dear, and neither can you ; for I 
have a nice little heart of stone and a smart new breast- 
plate of iron. The interest I take in you is something 
quite extraordinary ; but the most extraordinary thing in 
it is that it's perfectly prepared to tolerate the interest of 
others." 

" The interest of others needn't trouble it much ! " Miriam 
declared. " If Mr. Dormer had broken off his marriage to 
such an awfully fine woman (for she is that, your swell of a 
sister), it isn't for a loud wretch like me. He's kind to me 
because that's his nature, and he notices me because that's his 
business ; but he's away up in the clouds a thousand miles 





over my head. He has got something ' on,' as they say ; he's 
in love with an idea. I think it's a shocking bad one, but 
that's his own affair. He's quite exalte; living on nectar 
and ambrosia what he has to spare for us poor crawling 
things on earth is only a few dry crumbs. I didn't even ask 
him to come to rehearsal. Besides, he thinks you're in love 
with me and that it wouldn't be honourable to cut in. He's 
capable of that isn't it charming?" 

"If he were to relent and give up his scruples, would you 
marry him?" asked Sherringham. 

"Mercy, how you chatter about marrying!" the girl 
laughed. "You've all got it on the brain." 

"Why, I put it that way to please you, because you 
complained to me last year precisely that this was not what 
seemed generally to be wanted." 

"Oh, last year!" Miriam murmured. Then, differently: 
" Yes, it's very tiresome ! " she exclaimed. 

"You told me moreover in Paris, more than once, that 
you wouldn't listen to anything but that." 

"Well, I won't, but I shall wait till I find a husband 
who's bad enough. One who'll beat me and swindle me and 
spend my money on other women that's the sort of man 
for me. Mr. Dormer, delightful as he is, doesn't come up to 
that." 

" You'll marry Basil Dashwood," Sherringham replied. 

" Oh, marry ? call it marry, if you like. That's what poor 
mother says she lives in dread of it." 

" To this hour," said Sherringham, " I haven't managed to 
make out what your mother wants. She has so many ideas, 
as Madame Carre said." 

" She wants me to be a tremendous sort of creature all her 
ideas are reducible to that. What makes the muddle is that 
she isn't clear about the kind of creature she wants most. A 
great actress or a great lady sometimes she inclines for one 
and sometimes for the other ; but on the whole she persuades 
herself that a great actress, if she'll cultivate the right people, 
may be a great lady. When I tell her that won't do and 
that a great actress can never be anything but a great vaga- 
bond, then the dear old thing has tantrums and we have 
scenes the most grotesque : they'd make the fortune, for a 
subject, of some play- writ ing fellow, if he had the wit to 
guess them ; which, luckily for us perhaps, he never will. 
She usually winds up by protesting devinez un pen quoi ! " 
Miriam added. And as her companion professed his complete 





inability to divine : " By declaring that rather than take it 
that way I must marry you." 

" She's shrewder than I thought. It's the last of vanities to 
talk about it, but I may mention in passing that if you would 
marry me you should be the greatest of all possible ladies." 

" Heavens, my dear fellow, what natural capacity have I 
for that?"
