covered her head with her hands, as if trying to shield herself 
from the terrible light of day. But the veil had gone down 
into the thicket, whither she dared not follow. She stood ir 
resolute. 

" I will get it for you before the others come back," said 
Keith. " It is gone now, however, and, what is more, you 
could not help it ; so sit down, like a sensible creature, and 
enjoy the breeze." 

The little nun sat down, and confusedly tried to be a sen 
sible creature. Her head, with its short rings of dark hair, 
rose childlike from the black gown she wore, and the breeze 
swept freshly over her ; but her eyes were full of tears, and 
her face so pleading in its pale, silent distress, that at length 
Keith went down and brought back the veil. 

" See the cranes flying home," he said, as the long line 
clotted the red of the west. " They always seem to be flying 
right into the sunset, sensible birds ! " 



The little Sister had heard that word twice now ; evidently 
the cranes were more sensible than she. She sighed as she 
fastened on the veil ; there were a great many hard things 
out in the world, then, she thought. At the dear convent it 
was not expected that one should be as a crane. 

The other two came back at length, wet and triumphant, 
with their prize. They had stopped to bail it out, plug its 
cracks, mend the old sail after a fashion, and nothing would 
do but that the three should sail home in it, Pedro, for whom 
there was no room, returning by the way they had come. 
Carrington, having worked hard, was determined to cany out 
his plan ; and said so. 

" A fine plan to give us all a wetting," remarked Keith. 

" You go down there and work an hour or two yourself, 
and see howjw/ like it," answered the other, with the irrele 
vance produced by aching muscles and perspiration dripping 
from every pore. 

This conversation had taken place at the edge of the 
marsh where they had brought the boat up through one of 
the numerous channels. 

" Very well," said Keith. " But mind you, not a word 
.about danger before the Sister. I shall have hard enough 
work to persuade her to come with us as it is." 

He went back to the ridge, and carelessly suggested returning home by water. 

" You will not have to go through the thicket then," he 
said. 

Somewhat to his surprise, Sister St. Luke consented im 
mediately, and followed without a word as he led the way. 
She was mortally afraid of the water, but, during his absence, 
she had been telling her beads, and thinking with contrition 
of two obstinacies in one day that of the thicket and that of 
the veil she could not, she would not have three. So, com 
mending herself to all the saints, she embarked. 

" Look here, Carrington, if ever you inveigle me into such 
danger again for a mere fool's fancy, I will show you what I 



 

think of it. You knew the condition of that boat, and I did 
not," said Keith, sternly, as the two men stood at last on the 
beach in front of the lighthouse. The Sister had gone 
within, glad to feel land underfoot once more. She had sat 
quietly in her place all the way, afraid of the water, of the 
wind, of everything, but entirely unconscious of the real dan 
ger that menaced them. For the little craft would not mind 
her helm ; her mast slipped about erratically ; the planking at 
the bow seemed about to give way altogether ; and they were 
on a lee shore, with the tide coming in, and the surf beating 
roughly on the beach. They were both good sailors, but it 
had taken all they knew to bring the boat safely to the light 
house. 

" To tell the truth, I did not think she was so crippled," 
said Carrington. "She really is a good boat for her size." 

" Very," said Keith sarcastically. 

But the younger man clung to his opinion ; and, in order to 
verify it, he set himself to work repairing the little craft. You 
would have supposed his daily bread depended upon her be 
ing made seaworthy, by the way he labored. She was made 
over from stem to stern : a new mast, a new sail ; and, finally, 
scarlet and green paint were brought over from the village, 
and out she came as brilliant as a young paroquet. Then 
Carrington took to sailing in her. Proud of his handy work, 
he sailed up and down, over to the reef, and up the inlet, and
