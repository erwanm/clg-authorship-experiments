the girls, and before they have a taste of real 
womanhood they have lovers and marry. We 
rush into everything nowadays. But you haven't 
changed very much. And though you will have 
to be satisfied with two elderly people for a few 
days, I want to ask you to be a real girl and en- 
thuse over poetry, and insist on all manner of 
young beliefs, and consider life truly worth liv- 
ing for all the pleasures it will bring. 

"It brings a good many, and some of the per- 
plexities turn into them if you give them time." 

"There is philosophy in that, too," and he 
smiled. "You have had some of them. And they 
brightened as they took their flight. I think 
troubles ought to do this as well as blessings." 

"I'll try to remember that." 

Yes, her voice had the old girlish ring. 




"And what were you doing all summer?" he 
asked, studying her attentively. 

"We — myself and my chum, I suppose girls as 
well as boys can have chums — went to the seaside 
with an invalid friend. The sea was glorious, 
the little village, old and queer, with bits of new- 
ness set here and there on the outskirts. One bit 
of the newness was a charming New York family 
with seven children in all stages, the eldest girl en- 
gaged. They made me think of an English novel. 
And we had a play for a charity, and musicale 
for a little chapel. The sails were splendid, the 
walks were — well queer, among the remnants of 
pine barrens and stretches of sand. But it had 
picturesque aspects, and now I know what the 
ocean is like." 

"We tried it up to Nova Scotia, and that was 
picturesque." 

"And you had all the romantic St. Lawrence 
and the historic cities and places." 

Her eyes were alight with interest; in their 
alertness they questioned him and Mr. Bell was 
delighted to talk to so attentive a listener. And 
she knew almost as much about each place as if 
she had been there, and they branched off into the 
great struggle between the French and English 
and the heroes of that period. It pleased him 



 

very much that she should seem as happy with 
them as if the younger people were about. For 
he had been having a little experience during the 
summer of being pushed aside. 

They sat around the fire afterward, it seemed 
so cosy to watch the flames playing hide and 
seek as if they had some mysterious life. 

"I wonder if you are as fond of verses as you 
used to be? Our modern writers have been 
criticised so much for lack of true poetic strength 
that I have compromised and simply call them 
verses now-a-days. I have some new volumes. 
I like the sweet tender touches in their simplicity, 
and I want to hear you read some of them." 

"Oh, with pleasure. I think I know your little 
gift-book all by heart," and she raised apprecia- 
tive eyes. She never knew how near she had 
come to losing it. 



CHAPTER XI 

A GIRL IN LOVE 

She found in the guest chamber a box of 
pansies in bloom. There was Daisy's room much 
more ornate than when she had last seen it, full 
of all manner of keepsakes and souvenirs. How 
strange it was to be here and not see Daisy. 
She would marry presently and go away, and 
Willard also. They would be left here alone, — 
oh, no, there would be grandchildren. If she 
had been horn in just such a home and with just 
such a mother! This mother would understand 
the many wants and mysteries that often crowded
