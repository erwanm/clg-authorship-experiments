One lovely moonlight evening Mr. Sargent called in. 
Theo had gone to bed with a headache. When these 
severe ones came on, there was nothing for hei but a dark, 
quiet room, and entire rest. Mother was busy in the 
kitchen, and Dell and Dick were studying lessons. 

“ You are looking pale and weary,” Mr. Sargent said 
kindly. “ Suppose we go out for a walk? These spring 
days are very trying. It is too cool without a fire, and 
too warm with one. Out of doors it is delightful.” 

I put on my hat and sack. He drew my arm gently 
through his, and we walked up the street, toward the 
country part of the town. Somewhere in the distance 
beyond, there was a frog-pond ; and to-night the echoes 
seemed to have a hopeful, spring-like sound. 

“ How quiet you are ! ” he began presently. “ There 
is no new trouble, surely? ” 

“ There is no need of new troubles. We are not done 
with the old ones,” I answered. 

“ My poor little girl, I think you have had your full 
share. I wish I could do or say something to comfort.” 





He drew me closer, with an indescribably tender motion. 
I felt so weak, depressed, and his sympathy touched the 
tenderest chord of my being, moved me to tears. I gave 
a little, half-strangled sob in my breath, before I was 
aware. 

‘ ‘ O my love ! my tired little darling ! ’ ’ 

We both stopped. There was a great open space, and 
just beyond a straggling grove of trees that had thus far 
defied the march of improvement. The city had not gone 
out so rapidly this way. 

His arms fell : nay, the hands closed in a quick, tense 
grip ; and through my tears I knew it was. not the clasp 
of happy love, or any delicious vision seen in the dis- 
tance. It struck a chill to my soul, prepared me instantly 
for what was coming. 

“ Christabel,” why is it that people always give you 
j"Our full name in the instant of trouble, anger, or pain? — 
“ Christabel, I was a coward, and worse, to utter those 
endearing words, and yet I love you, love you as I 
have no right to love any woman, save the one to whom 
my word is plighted. Yet what makes the right and 
wrong, the honor and the dishonor? I have tried not 
only to guard myself, but to guard you, as any tender 
brother might have done. I have lingered within sight of 
you, watched you when others were around, and said, 
‘ Thus far, and no farther ; ’ and now all my mortal weak- 
ness has found a voice. O Christabel ! can it ever be for- 
given, this sin against you? ’’ 

I put out my hand blindly. Since he had not deceived 
me wilfully, since he must suffer, might we not as well 
have the fellowship in our anguish ? 

“ My little darling ! A man ought to take you to his 
heart, and make paths for your poor tired feet, carry you 
over rough ways. Shall I do it? ” 

He seemed to ask the question as much of himself as 
of me. Should I, could I, go to happiness treading over 
another woman’s heart? 


 


“ No, no ! I cried, with a pang that seemed to wrench 
my very soul apart. 

“You despise me ! any good woman would.” 

“ I am not a good woman, then. I do not despise, nor 
hate, hardly blame. I see now how you have tried ; but 
it is hard — to give up all in a moment.” 

“ Let me tell you my story, and you shall be the judge. 
If you think honor binds me, and must be obeyed at any 
cost, I will bow my head humbly, and take up the frag- 
ments. If not, nothing shall induce me to sacrifice two 
souls.” 

He was deathly pale ; but his firm lips and resolute eyes 
indicated much mental strength. 

“ Tell me,” I said huskily. “ I must hear all now.”
