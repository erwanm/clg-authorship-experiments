fires where I live," said her nephew, as if with the 
wish to be a little more accurate. 

Jerry asked Lemuel to watch Mrs. Harmon 's goods 
while he went for a carriage, and said sir to him. 
It seemed to Lemuel that this respect, and Mrs. 
Harmon 's unmerited praises, together with the doom 
that was secretly upon him, would drive him wild. 



XXIV. 

THE evening after the fire Mrs. Sewell sat talking 
it over with her husband, in the light of the news 
paper reports, which made very much more of 
Lemuel 's part in it than she liked. The reporters had 
flattered the popular love of the heroic in using Mrs. 
Harmon 's version of his exploits, and represented 
him as having been most efficient and daring 
throughout, and especially so in regard to the 
Evanses. 

" Well, that doesn't differ materially from what 
they told us themselves," said Sewell. 

"You know very well, David," retorted his wife, 
" that there couldn't have been, the least danger at 
any time ; and when he helped her to get Mr. Evans 
downstairs, the fire was nearly all out." 

" Very well, then ; he would have saved their lives 
if it had been necessary. It was a case of potential 
heroism, that contained all the elements of self- 
sacrifice." 

Mrs. Sewell could not deny this, but she was not 
satisfied. She was silent a moment before she 
asked, "What do you suppose that wretched 
creature will do now ? " 

 

"I think very likely he will come to me," 
answered Sewell. 

"I dare say." The bell rang. "And I suppose 
that 's he now ! " 

They listened and heard Miss Vane 's voice at the 
door, asking for them. 

Mrs. Sewell ran down the stairs and kissed her. 
" Oh, I' m so glad you came. Isn't it wonderful ? 
I've  just come from them, and she 's taking the 
whole care of him, as if he had always been the sick 
one, and she strong and well." 

" What do you mean, Lucy ? He isn't ill ! " 

" Who isn't ? " 

" What are you talking about ? " 

" About Mr. Evans " 

" Oh ! " said Miss Vane, with cold toleration. 
She arrived at the study door and gave Sewell her 
hand. "I scarcely knew him, you know; I only 
met him casually here. I've  come to see," she added 
nervously, "if you know where Lemuel is, Mr. 
Sewell. Have you seen anything of him since the 
fire ? How nobly he behaved ! But I never saw 
anything he wasn't equal to ! " 

" Mrs. Sewell objects to his saving human life," 
said Sewell, not able to deny himself. 

" I don't see how you can take the slightest 
interest in him," began Mrs. Sewell, saying a little 
more than she meant. 

" You would, my dear," returned Miss Vane, " if 
you had wronged him as I have." 

" Or as I," said Sewell. 



 

I' m thankful I haven t, then," said his wife. 
" It seems to me that there 's nothing else of him. 
As to his noble behaviour, it isn't possible you be 
lieve those newspaper accounts ? He didn't save 
any one 's life ; there was no danger ! " 

Miss Vane, preoccupied with her own ideal of the 
facts, stared at her without replying, and then turned 
to Sewell.
