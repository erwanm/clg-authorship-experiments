floor ; it was the same set which Miss Graham wad 
in ; she smiled and beckoned derisively. A vain 
and foolish ambition fired him. " Oh yes, I can 
dance a little," he said. 

A little was quite enough for the eager ofl&cer. 
He had Colville a partner in an instant, and the 
next he was on the floor. 

" Oh, what fun ! " cried Miss. Graham ; but the 
fun had not really begun yet. 

Colville had forgotten everything about the 
Lancers. He walked round like a bear in a pen : 
he capered to and fro with a futile absurdity ; 
people poked him hither and thithet' ; his progress 
was attended by rending noises from the trains 
over which he found his path. He smiled and 
cringed, and apologised to the hardening faces of 
the dancers : even Miss Graham's face had become 
very grave. 

" This won't do," said the Englishman at last, 
with cold insolence. He did not address himself to 
any one ; he merely stopped ; they all stopped, and 
Colville was effectively expelled the setj? another 
partner was found for his lady, and he wandered 
giddily away. He did not know where to turn ; the 
whole room must have seen what an incredible ass 
he had made of himself, but Mrs. Bowen looked as 
if she had not seen. 



 

He went up to her, resolved to make fun of him- 
self at the first sign she gave of being privy to his 
disgrace. But she only said, " Have you found 
your way to the supper-room yet ? " 

" Oh yes ; twice," he answered, and kept on 
talking with her and Madame Uccelli. After 
five minutes or so something occurred to Colville. 
" Have you found the way to the supper-room yet, 
Mrs. Bowen ? " 

" No ! " she owned, with a small, pathetic laugh, 
which expressed a certain physical famtness, and 
reproached him with insupportable gentleness for 
his selfish obtuseness. 

" Let me show you the way," he cried. 

" Why, I am rather hungry," said Mrs. Bowen, 
taking his arm, with a patient arrangement first Of 
her fan, her bouquet, and her train, and then mov- 
ing along by his side with a delicate-footed pace, 
which insinuated and deprecated her dependence 
upon him. 

There were only a few people in the supper-room, 
and they had it practically to themselves. She took 
a cup of tea and a slice of buttered bread, with a 
little salad, which she excused herself from eating 
because it was the day after her headache. " I 
shouldn't have thought you wBre hungry, Mrs. 
Bowen," he said, " if you hadn't told me so," and 
he recalled that, as a young girl, her fiiend used to 
laugh at her for having such a butterfly appetite ; 
she was in fact one of those women who go through 
hfe the marvels of such of our brutal sex as observe 



 

the ethereal nature of their diet But in an illogical 
revulsion of feeling, Colville, who was again cram- 
ming himself with all the solids and fluids in reach, 
and storing up a vain regret against the morrow, 
preferred her delicacy to the magnificent rapacity 
of Miss Graham : Imogene had passed from salad 
to ice, and at his suggestion had frankly reverted to 
salad again and then taken- a second ice, with the 
robust appetite of perfect health and perfect youth. 
He felt a desire to speak against her to Mrs. Bowen, 
he did not know why and he did not know how ; 
he veiled his feeling in an open attack. "Miss 
Graham has just been the cause of my playing 
the fool, with her dancing. She dances so superbly 
that she makes you want to dance too â€” she made 
me feel as if I could dance." 

" Yes," said Mrs. Bowen ; " it was very kind of 
you to complete the set. I saw you dancing," she 
added, without a glimmer of guilty consciousness in 
her eyes. 

It was very sweet, but Colville had to protest.
