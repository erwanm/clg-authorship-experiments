gone with us. It must be for the best. I'm sure 
it was ordered so. But all that doesn 't relieve 
Don Ippolito from the charge of black ingratitude, 
and want of consideration for us. He's quite made 
fools of us." 

"He was not to blame. It was a very great step 
for him. And if " .... 

" I know that. But he ought not to have talked 
of it. He ought to have known his own mind fully 
before speaking ; that's the only safe way. Well, 
then, there is nothing to prevent our going to-mor 
row." 

Florida drew a long breath, and rose to go on 
with the work of packing. 

" Have you been crying, Florida ? Well, of 
course, you can 't help feeling sorry for such a man. 
There's a great deal of good in Don Ippolito, a 



 

great deal. But when you come to my age you 
won 't cry so easily, my dear. It's very trying," 
said Mrs. Vervain. She sat awhile in silence be 
fore she asked : " Will he come here to-morrow 
morning ? " 

Her daughter looked at her with a glance of ter 
rified inquiry. 

"Do have your wits about you, my dear ! We 
can 't go away without saying good-by to him, and 
we can 't go away without paying him." 

" Paying him ? " 

" Yes, paying him paying him for your les 
sons. It's always been very awkward. He hasn t 
been like other teachers, you know : more like a 
guest, or friend of the family. He never seemed 
to want to take the money, and of late, I Ve been 
letting it run along, because I hated so to offer ic, 
till now, it's quite a sum. I suppose he needs it, 
poor fellow. And how to get it to him is the ques 
tion. He may not come to-morrow, as usual, and 
I could n t trust it to the padrone. We might 
send it to him in a draft from Paris, but I d rather 
pay him before we go. Besides, it would be rather 
rude, going away without seeing him again." Mrs. 
Vervain thought a moment ; then, " I'll tell you," 
she resumed. " If he doesn 't happen to come here 
to-morrow morning, we can stop on our way to the 
station and give him the money." 

Florida did not answer. 

"don 't you think that would be a good plan ? " 



 

" I don 't know," replied the girl in a dull way 

" Why, Florida, if you think from anything Don 
Ippolito said that he would rather not see us again 
that it would be painful to him why, we could 
ask Mr. Ferris to hand him the money." 

" Oh no, no, no, mother! " cried Florida, hiding 
her face, " that would be too horribly indelicate ! " 

" Well, perhaps it would n t be quite good taste," 
said Mrs. Vervain perturbedly, "but you needn t 
express yourself so violently, my dear. It's not a 
matter of life and death. I'm sure I don 't know 
what to do. We must stop at Don Ippolito's 
house, I suppose. don 't you think so ? " 

" Yes," faintly assented the daughter. 

Mrs. Vervain yawned. "Well I can 't think 
anything more about it to-night ; I'm too stupid. 
But that's the way we shall do. Will you help me 
to bed, my dear ? I shall be good for nothing to 
morrow." 

She went on talking of Don Ippolito's change of 
purpose till her head touched the pillow, from 
which she suddenly lifted it again, and called out to 
her daughter, who had passed into the next room : 
" But Mr. Ferris why didn t he come back with 
you?" 

" Come back with me ? "
