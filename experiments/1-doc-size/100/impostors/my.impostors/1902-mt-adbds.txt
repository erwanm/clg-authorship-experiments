There was no noisy demonstration
but all about the house one voice 
after another muttered: 
"That settles it He's Archy's Arch's 
meat." 

What to do now? Nobody seemed 
to know. It was an embarrassing 
situation for the moment — merely, of 
course, because matters had taken 
such a sudden and unexpected turn 
that these unpractised minds were 
not prepared for it, and had come to a 
standstill, like a stopped clock, under 
the shock. But after a little the ma- 
chinery began to work again, tenta- 
tively, and by twos and threes the 
men put their heads together and 
privately buzzed over this and that 
and the other proposition. One of 
these propositions met with much fa- 
ingthe '» it was, to conf er upon the assassin 
assassin   q£ thanks for removing Flint 
Buclmer, and let him go. Butthe 
cooler heads opposed it, pointing out 
that addled brains in tHeEastern 
States would pronounce it a scandal, 
and make no end of foolish noise 
about it. In the end the cool heads 
got the upper hand, and obtained 
general consent to a proposition of 
their own, and their leader then called 
the house to order and stated it — to 
this effect: that Fetlock Jones be 
jailed and put upon his trial. 

The motion was carried. Appar- 
ently there was nothing further to do 
now, and the people were glad, for, 
privately, they were impatient to get 
out and rush to the scene of the trag- 
edy, and see whether that barrel and 
the other things were really there or 
not. 

But no— the break-up got a check. 
The surprises were not over yet. For 
a while Fetlock Jones had been silent- 
ly sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- 
ing excitements which had been fol- 
lowing one another so persistently 
for some time; but when his arrest 
and trial were decreed, he broke out 
despairingly, and said : 

"No! it's no use. I don't want 
any jail, I don't want any trial; I've 
had all the hard luck I want, and all 
the miseries. Hang me now, and let 
me out! It would all come out, any- 
way — there couldn't anjhing save 
me. He bas told it all, just as if he'd 
been with me and seen it — I don't

know how he found out; and you 
find the barrel and things, and then I 
The wouldn't have any chance any more. 

sl' I killed him; and you'd have done 
it too, if he'd treated you like a dog, 
and you only a boy, and weak and 
poor, and not a friend to help you." 

"And served him damned well 
right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. 
"Looky here, boys—" 

From the constable: "Order! Or- 
der, gentlemen!" 

A voice: "Did your uncle know 
what you was up to?" 

"No, he didn't." 

"Did he give you the matches, 
sure enough?" 



"Yes, he did; but he didn't know 
what I wanted them for' 

" When you was out on such a busi- 
ness as that, how did you venture to 
risk having him along — and him a 
detective? How's that?" 

The boy hesitated, fumbled with 
his buttons in an embarrassed way,
