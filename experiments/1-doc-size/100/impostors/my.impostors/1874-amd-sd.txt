"And she has the cunningest winter fern- 
eries that you ever saw, Mr. Ogden," declared 
Fan. 

" I like them too. They always give me a 
peculiar sensation of the quiet and shade in 
which they grew. They are like the Quakers,

never surprising you by any gaudy freaks of blos- 
soming. Oh, were any of you here a month ago? ' 

"I came for rhododendrons one day;' Jennie; 
answered. 

" That was what entered my mind. What 
crowds and crowds of trees ! I am generally here 
in August, so I miss that. How perfectly glori- 
ous they must be. What colors? 

Pure white and pale, blossomy pink.' 
Those are my favorites. I sometimes think 
I was meant for a country life. I like the grow- 
ing and blossoming, the ripening and the fruit. 
Autumn rounds everything so perfectly." 

"Yes,' said Dick, "there is always a great 
richness in Autumn. The smells of the drying 
fields, of the stacked corn, the apples and pears 
and grapes. And the leaves all aglow, the chest- 
nuts full of yellow burrs. You ought to come 
then, Mr. Ogden!" 

"I believe I will. Can we all go nutting? 
That is after the frosts, though." 

"Yes, late in October." 

"Oh, look!" 

We had been going on for a few moments, 
now we paused again. It was so all the way 
up. Something to see and to feel, to pause and 



 

drink in with all one's soul. Here a rock sculp- 
tured and set as if by an artist hand. Richest 
moss, great, feathery fronds, pellucid waters, 
breaks of sunshine, and haunts of deep gloom. 
Now we were serious, then we laughed gaily at 
some quick jest. It takes so little to amuse 
when one is young and happy. 

We passed the stream at length and went on 
to the mountain-top. What a fair outlying 
prospect ! There was the village below, the 
church spires, some tall factory chimneys, and 
beyond it all mountains again. I thought of 
the hills standing about Jerusalem, and the Lord 
everywhere, standing about his people. 

" O," exclaimed Fan at length, "we must go 
back, who will get our dinner ? ' 

" Who will eat it ? is a subject for our more 
serious consideration ; ' said Winthrop. 

"And if 

' When we get there 
The cupboard is bare ? ' 

"That would be a dire misfortune. By the 
time we reach the bottom again, we shall be as 
hungry as bears." 

"You might comfort yourself like the old man 
of Kilkenny." 



 

"How was that?' inquired Winthrop. 
Stuart's eyes twinkled with their fun-loving 

light as he began : 

" There was an old man of Kilkenny. 
Who never had more than a penny. 
He spent all that money in onions and honey, 
This wayward old man of Kilkenny." 

They all laughed heartily. We began our 
descent but were changed about somehow. Every 
body helped the one who came to hand. Now 
it was Dick, then Mr. Ogden or Stuart. We 
slipped and scrambled and uttered small shrieks,
