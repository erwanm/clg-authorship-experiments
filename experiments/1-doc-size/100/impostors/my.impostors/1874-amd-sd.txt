He pretended to be much aggrieved, but in 

reality lie was very gay. I had never seen him 
so amusing and entertaining. 



 

"I don't see how you get acquainted with 
such loads of nice people ; ' said Allie West. 
"And you always have such good times here." 

The good times came without any trying 
There are numberless gates called Beautiful all 
along life, at which you give such as you have, 
and find it more precious than silver or gold. 

It was a lovely moon-light night, so after sup- 
per we walked part of the way with the merry 
crowd. It did not seem to me that I had ever 
been so happy in my life. I could not tell why but 
I felt as if I must have wings somewhere that 
were lifting me off the ground at every step. 

We rambled around under the trees and by 
the way side. Louis came back to my vicinity 
and we fell into a rather grave talk about the 
future. 

"I never thought I should want to stay here 
so much," he said. "I was glad enough to get 
away last summer. I cannot forgive myself for 
being such a boor ! Now I shall want to come 
again and again." 

"Well why not?" I returned. 
"I am afraid you will become tired of me." 
" Try us and see. We are not easily wearied.'' 
"You are all so generous with yourselves." 
I smiled a little. "Why not jnve of your 


best?" 

" True." Then there was a silence. We 
reached the gate presently. " Do not go in just 
yet ; ' he pleaded, so we remained in the silvery 
light that was flooding the whole earth. Moon- 
light always stirs the tender and thoughtful side- 
. of one's soul. 

" I am glad that to-morrow will be Sunday. I 
can just think how I shall enjoy going to church 
and hearing your father preach." 

This from him who had despised religion and 
sneered at sermons. It did startle me. 

" And to have Stephen here." 

I am rejoiced that you feel so kindly toward 
one another," I replied. " You are getting to be 
brothers indeed." 

" And then will come weeks and weeks of 
study," he went on in a musing tone. " I like 
it. Books seem to me well, better than some 
people. Only if you could all come down in 
the winter. Stephen and Mrs. Whitcomb were 
planning for it, but there ! it was a secret and 
I have betrayed it." 

"I can keep secrets;' and I smiled up into 
his remorseful face. 

 

"Yes; I have proved that. Rose" after a 
pause- -"I have half a mind to tell you another, 
to ask some - - advice ; at least, I would like to 
know how it appears to you." 

" Will it be of any real avail ? ' I asked, 
noting the perplexed lines on his countenance. 
" I am not as wise as you think. Because I 
just happened to stumble into one matter with- 
out making a mess of it 

" This is only an idea. I cannot ask Stephen. 
I think it would please him and he might judge 
wrongfully." 

" If I can help you ; ' I replied encouragingly. 

"It is about the future. It may never come 
to anything to be sure, and perhaps I never can 
be good enough. Stuart will go into business. 
He does not love study and he needs an active 
life. He wanted Stephen to put him in a store
