because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing 
on a fact is to go and examine for yourself and not 
take it on anybody's say-so. But I had to give in, 
now, that the widder was right. That is, she was 
right as to the rest of the world, but she warn't 
right about the part our village is in : that part is 
the shape of a plate, and flat, I take my oath. 

The professor was standing still all this time 
like he was asleep, but he broke loose, now, and 
he was mighty bitter. He says something like 
this : 

'Idiots ! they said it wouldn't go. And they 
wanted to examine it and spy around and get the 
secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody 
knows the secret but me ! Nobody knows what 
makes it move but me ; and it's a new power ! A 
new power, and a thousand times the strongest in 
the earth. Steam's foolishness to it. They said 
I couldn't go to Europe. To Europe ! why there's 
power aboard to last five years, and food for three 
months. They are fools — what do they know about 
it ? Yes, and they said my air-ship was flimsy ; 
why, she's good for fifty years. I can sail the skies 
all my life if I want to, and steer where I please, 
though they laughed at that, and said I couldn't. 
Couldn't steer ! Come here, boy ; we'll see. You 
press these buttons as I tell you.' 

He made Tom steer the ship all about and every 
which way, and learnt him the whole thing in 
nearly no time, and Tom said it was perfectly easy. 
He made him fetch the ship down 'most to the 
earth, and had him spin her along so close to the 

Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the 
farmers and hear everything they said, perfectly 
plain ; and he flung out printed bills to them that 
told about the balloon and said it was going to 
Europe. Tom got so he could steer straight for a 
tree till he got nearly to it and then dart up and 
skin right along over the top of it. Yes, and he 
learnt Tom how to land her ; and he done it first 
rate, too, and set her down in the prairie as soft as 
wool ; but the minute we started to skip out the 
professor says, ' No you don't ! ' and shot her up 
into the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, 
and so did Jim ; but it only give his temper a rise, 
and be begun to rage around and look wild out of 
his eyes, and I was scared of him. 

Well, then he got on to his troubles again, and 
mourned and grumbled about the way he was 
treated, and couldn't seem to git over it, and espe- 
cially people's saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed 
at that, and at their saying she warn't simple and 
would be always getting out of order. Get out of 
order— that gravelled him ; he said she couldn't any 
more get out of order than the solar sister. He got 
worse and worse, and I never see a person take on 
so. It give me the cold shivers to see him, and 
so it did Jim. By-and-by he got to yelling and 
screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn't 
ever have his secret at all now, it had treated him 
so mean. He said he would sail his balloon around 
the globe just to show what he could do, and then he 
would sink it in the sea, and sink us all along with 
it, too. Well, it was the awfullest fix to be in ; and 
here was night coming on. 

He give us something to eat, and made us go 
to the other end of the boat, and laid down on a 
locker where he could boss all the works, and put 
his old pepper-box revolver under his head, and said 
anybody that come fooling around there trying to 
land her he would kill him. 

We set scrunched up together, and thought 
considerable, but didn't say nothing, only just a 
word once in a while when a body had to say some- 
thing or bust, we was so scared and worried. The 
night dragged along slow and lonesome. We was 
pretty low down, and the moonshine made every- 
thing soft and pretty, and the farm-houses looked 
snug and homeful, and we could hear the farm 
sounds, and wished we could be down there ; but 
laws ! we just slipped along over them like a ghost, 
and never left a track. 
Away in the night, when all the sounds was late 
sounds, and the air had a late feel, and a late smell, 
too — about a two o'clock feel, as near as I could 
make out— Tom said the professor was so quiet 
this long time he must be asleep, and we better 

' Better what ? ' I says in a whisper, and feel- 
ing sick all over, because I knowed what he was 
thinking about. 

 Better slip back there and tie him and land the
