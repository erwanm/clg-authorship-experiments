I’ve lost you, Papa! (The child runs
down the path. Closely following
him, fair and gentle, brightly smiling,)

Enter MRS. FAYTH. (She draws back
quickly; utters an inarticulate exclamation;
extends her hands in an impulsive
gesture of delight. But she
withdraws and puts her finger on her
lips. She retreats without speaking.)

(MRS. FAYTH, hidden for a moment behind the thicket of roses, reappears
beyond with the other spirits. The group of spirits stirs upward in the
bright scenery.)

(DR. THORNE and his Wife, having seen or heard nothing, still stand
rapt, embracing solemnly.)

LADDIE (stops on the path, irresolute. Frowns a little in pretty,
childish perplexity; makes as if he would go back; looks at the two
again. Then suddenly darts forward; cries). Why, that’s my Mamma!
(Springs to her; clutches at her white robe, pulls at her hand.)

HELEN THORNE (recognizes the child instantly, despite his larger
stature; she cries out). Why, my little boy! Mother’s baby boy! Oh!
you again, ... you, too! My little, little boy. (Catches him to her;
kisses him wildly; holds him, and releases him, and holds him again.
Murmurs half-intelligible words brokenly.) Mother’s baby!... Mother’s
beauty!... Oh, mamma missed you, sonny-boy--

(DR. THORNE does not speak. His face is shining. He holds his wife
within his arms as if he feared to lose her if he loosened them.)

(THE CHILD, laughing softly, fondles his mother. The three stand
clinging together rapturously.)

VOICES (from beyond the rose thicket chant).

    “As it was in the beginning, is now,
     And ever shall be,
     World without end. Amen.”

(Chorus of spirits from the region of the Temple on the Heavenly Hill
very softly sing.)

    “O Paradise! O Paradise!
       The world is growing old.
     Who would not see that heavenly land,
       Where love is never cold?” ...

(As they sing, the fair country brightens subtly, and all the heavenly
scene is radiant. The moving groups of spirits seem to be joining in the
song.)

(DR. THORNE and his Wife, turning, look into one another’s faces.
They do not speak.)

(Now, delicately, it shall be seen to darken on the bright land, and a
holy half-light touches every outline.)

(The Child leaves his parents. He walks a few steps away, shading his
eyes with one hand, as if he saw invisible glory; in the other hand he
carries the annunciation lily.)

(Vaguely at first, then more definitely; slowly and solemnly,)

       Enter JESUS THE CHRIST.

(The Sacred Figure advances towards the Man and Woman, who are
unconscious of the approach. Its hands are stretched in benediction. It
stands for a moment, mutely, and unseen by them.)

(The Boy runs towards it fearlessly; seats himself upon the
meadow-grass at the feet of the Figure.)

(The Sacred Figure stirs towards the child. All the light in the
scene now falls from the Figure.)

(The Man, the Woman, and the Child receive its full effulgence.)

VOICES FROM BEYOND (sing).

    “Where loyal hearts and true
       Stand ever in the light,
     Enraptured through and through”--

(The Man and the Woman now perceive the Sacred Figure. They fall
to their knees. The man’s arm still encircles his wife. They bow their
heads before the Divine Presence.)

(The Child, with the lifted lily, remains at the feet of the
CHRIST.)

VOICES FROM BEYOND (repeat).

    “Enraptured through and through,
      In God’s most holy sight.”

(The Sacred Figure dims and slowly fades. With it disappears the
stalk of annunciation lilies. The light returns softly upon the
