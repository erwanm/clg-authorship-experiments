rather favored than arrested by the arrival of her brother 
Harold, who came in at the moment both his relatives 
had turned a back to the door, and who gave his sister, 
as she faced him, a greeting that made their mother look 
round.  '' Hallo, Nan — you are lovely ! Ain't she lovely, 
mother ?" 

" No V Mrs. Brook answered, not, however, otherwise 
noticing him. Her domestic despair centred at this in- 
stant all in her daughter. '  Well then, we shall con- 
sider — your father and I — that he must take the conse- 
quence.'' 

Nanda had now her hand on the door, while Harold 
had dropped on the sofa. " ' He ' ?" she just sounded. 

''I mean Mr.Longdon." 

'  And what do you mean by the consequence ?" 

"Well, it will do for the beginning of it that you'll 
please go down tuith him." 

" On Saturday then ? Thanks, mamma," the girl re- 
turned. 

She was instantly gone, on which Mrs. Brook had 
more attention for her son. This, after an instant, as 
she approached the sofa and raised her eyes from the lit- 
tle table beside it, came straight out.  ' Where in the 
world is that five-pound note ?" 

Harold looked vacantly about him. "What five-pound 
note ?"

Mr. Longdon 's garden took in three acres and, full 
of cliarming features, had for its greatest wonder the ex- 
tent and color of its old brick wall, of which the pink 
and purple surface was the fruit of the mild ages, and the 
protective function, for a visitor strolling, sitting, talk- 
ing, reading, that of a sort of nurse of reverie. The air 
of the place, in the August time, thrilled all the while 
with the bliss of birds, the hum of little lives unseen and 
the flicker of white butterflies. It was on the large, flat 
enclosed lawn that Nanda spoke to Vanderbank of the 
three weeks that she would have completed there on the 
morrow and that had been — she made no secret of it — 
the happiest she had yet spent anywhere. The grayish 
day was soft and still and the sky faintly marbled, while 
the more newly arrived of the visitors from London, who 
had come late on the Friday afternoon, lounged away the 
morning in an attitude of which every relaxed line re- 
ferred to the holiday he had, as it were — at first merely 
looking about and victualling — sat down in front of as a 
captain before a city. There were sitting-places, just 
there, out of the full light, cushioned benches in the 
thick wide spread of old mulberry boughs. A large book 
of facts lay in the young mane's lap, and Nanda had come 
out to him, half an hour before luncheon, somewhat as 





  

Beatrice came out to Benedick : not to call him immedi- 
ately, indeed, to the meal, but mentioning promptly that 
she had come at a bidding. Mr. Longdon had rebuked 
her, it appeared, for her want of attention to their guest, 
showing her in this way, to her pleasure, how far he had 
gone toward taking her, as he called it, into the house. 

' You've been thinking of yourself," Vanderbank 
asked,   ' as a mere clerk at a salary, and you now find 
that you're a partner and have a share in the concern ?" 

'•'It seems to be something like that. But doesn't a 
partner put in something ? What have I put in ?" 

" Well — me, for one thing. Isn't it your being here 
that has brought me down ?" 

 ' Do you mean you wouldn't have come for him alone ?
