" Come in ! " she answered boldly ; and her father, 
moving mechanically, with his stick in his hand, 
entered the room. He came as he had dismounted 
from his horse, in his riding boots, and his broad felt 
hat caught by the same fingers that held the stick. 

" You wished to see me, Hedwig," he said coldly, 
depositing his hat upon the table. Then, when he 
had slowly sat himself down in an armchair, he 
added, " Here I am." Hedwig had risen respectfully, and stood before him in the twilight. " What 
do you wish to say?" he asked in German. "You 
do not often honour your father by requesting his 
society." 

Hedwig stood one moment in silence. Her first 
impulse was to throw herself at his feet, and implore 
him to let her marry Nino. The thought swept away 
for the time the remembrance of Benoni and of what 
she had to tell. But a second sufficed to give her the 
mastery of her tongue and memory, which women 
seldom lose completely, even at the most desperate 
moments. 



 

" I desired to tell you," she said, " that Baron 
Benoni took advantage of your absence to-day to 
insult me beyond my endurance." She looked boldly 
into her father's eyes as she spoke. 

" Ah ! " said he, with great coolness. " Will you 
be good enough to light one of those candles on the 
table, and to close the window ? " 

Hedwig obeyed in silence, and once more planted 
herself before him, her slim figure looking ghostly 
between the fading light of the departing day and 
the yellow flame of the candle. 

"You need not assume this theatrical air," said 
Lira calmly. "I presume you mean that Baron 
Benoni asked you to marry him? " 

" Yes, that is one thing, and is an insult in itself," 
replied Hedwig, without changing her position. 

" I suspect that it is the principal thing," remarked 
the count. " Very good ; he asked you to marry 
him. He has my full authority to do so. What 
then?" 

" You are my father," answered Hedwig, standing 
like a statue before him, " and you have the right to 
offer me whom you please for a husband. But you 
have no authority to allow me to be wantonly 
insulted." 

"I think that you are out of your mind," said 
the count, with imperturbable equanimity. " You 
grant that I may propose a suitor to you, and you 
call it a wanton insult when that suitor respectfully 
asks the honour of your hand, merely because he is 
not young enough to suit your romantic tastes, which 
have been fostered by this wretched southern air. 



 

It is unfortunate that my health requires me to re 
side in Italy. Had you enjoyed an orderly Prussian 
education, you would have held different views in 
regard to filial duty. Refuse Baron Benoiii as often 
as you like. I will stay here, and so will he, I fancy, 
until you change your mind. I am not tired of this 
lordly mountain scenery, and my health improves 
daily. We can pass the summer and winter, and 
more summers and winters, very comfortably here. 
If there is anything you would like to have brought 
from Rome, inform me, and I will satisfy any reasonable request." 

" The baron has already had the audacity to inform 
me that you would keep me a prisoner until I should 
marry him," said Hedwig; &lt;*nd her voice trembled 
as she remembered how Benoni had told her so. 

" I doubt not that Benoni, who is a man of consummate tact, hinted delicately that he would not 
desist from pressing his suit. You, well knowing 
my determination, and carried away by your evil 
temper, have magnified into a threat what he never 
intended as such. Pray let me hear no more about 
these fancied insults." The old man smiled grimly 
at his keen perception. 

" You shall hear me, nevertheless," said Hedwig in 
a low voice, coming close to the table, and resting 
one hand upon it as though for support. 

" My daughter," said the count, " I desire you to 
abandon this highly theatrical and melodramatic tone. 
I am not to be imposed upon." 

"Baron Benoni did not confine himself to the 
course you describe. He said many things to me 



 

which I did not understand, but I comprehended 
their import. He began by making absurd speeches, 
at which I laughed. Then he asked me to marry 
him, as I had long known he would do as soon as 
you gave him the opportunity. I refused his offer. 
Then he insisted, saying that you, sir, had determined 
on this marriage, and would keep me a close prisoner 
here until the torture of the situation broke down my 
strength. I assured him that I would never yield to 
force. Then he broke out angrily, telling me to my 
face that I had lost everything, name, fame, and 
honour, how, I cannot tell ; but he said those words, 
adding that I could regain my reputation only by 
consenting to marry him." 

The old count had listened at first with a sarcastic 
smile, then with increased attention. Finally, as 
Hedwig repeated the shameful insult, his brave old 
blood boiled up in his breast, and he sat gripping the 
two arms of his chair fiercely, while his grey eyes 
shot fire from beneath the shaggy brows. 

"Hedwig," he cried hoarsely, are you speaking 
the truth ? Did he say those words ? " 

"Yes, my father, and more like them. Are you 
surprised? she asked bitterly. "You have said 
them yourself to me." 

The old man's rage rose furiously, and he struggled 
to his feet. He was stiff with riding and rheumatism, but he was too angry to sit still. 

" I ? Yes, I have tried to show you what might 
have happened, and to warn you and frighten you, 
as you should be frightened. Yes, and I was right, 
for you shall not drag my name in the dirt. But 
another man, Benoni ! " 



 

He could not speak, for his wrath, and his tall 
figure moved rapidly about the room, his heart seeking expression in action. He looked like some for 
gotten creature of harm, suddenly galvanised into 
destructive life. It was well that Benoni was not 
within reach. 

Hedwig stood calmly by the table, proud in her 
soul that her father should be roused to such fury. 
The old man paused in his walk, came to her, and 
with his hand turned her face to the light, gazing 
savagely into her eyes. 

" You never told me a lie," he growled out. 

" Never," she said boldly, as she faced him scornfully. 

He knew his own temper in his child, and was sat 
isfied. The soldier's habit of self-control was strong 
in him, and the sardonic humour of his nature served 
as a garment to the thoughts he harboured. 

" It appears," he said, " that I am to spend the 
remainder of an honourable life in fighting with a 
pack of hounds. I nearly killed your old acquaintance, the Signor Professore Cardegna, this afternoon." Hedwig staggered back, and turned pale. 

" What ! Is he wounded ? " she gasped out, pressing her hand to her side.
