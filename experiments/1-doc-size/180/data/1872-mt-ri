I resume my journal at the point where the procession arrived at the royal 
3 royal mausoleum : 



As the procession filed through the gate, the mihtary deployed handsomely to 
the right and left and formed an avenue through which the long column of 
mourners passed to the tomb. The coffin was borne through the door of the mau- 
soleum followed by the King and his chiefs, the great ofGcers of the kingdom, 
foreio'n Consuls, Embassadors and distinguished guests (Burlingame and General 
Van Valkenburgh). Several of the kahilis were then fastened to a frame-work in 
front of the tomb, there to renuiiu until they decay and fall to pieces, or, forestalling
this, until another scion of royalty dies. At this point of the proceedings the 
multitude set up such a heart-broken wailing as I hope never to hear again. The 
soldiers fired three volleys of musketry — the wailing being previously silenced to 
permit of the guns being heard. Eis Highness Prince William, in a showy mili- 
tary uniform (the " true prince," this — scion of the house over-thrown by the pres- 
ent dynasty — he was formerly betrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to 
marry her), stood guard and paced back and forth within the door. The privileged 
few who followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime, but the King 
soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it. A stranger could 
have guessed his rank (although he was so simply and unpretentiously dressed) 
by the profound deference paid him by all persons in his vicinity ; by seeing his 
high officers receive his quiet orders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered 
heads ; and by observing how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum 
were to aroid " crowding " him (although there was room enough in the door, 
way for a wagon to pass, for that niatter) ; how respectfully they edged out side- 
ways, scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view of 
their persons to his Majesty, and never putting their hats on until they were well 
out of the royal presence. 

He was dressed entirely in black — dress-coat and silk hat — and looked rather 
democratic in the midst of the showy uniibrms about him. On his breast he wore 
a large gold star, which was half hidden by the lappel of his coat. He remained 
at the door a half houi , and occasionally gave an order to the men who were erect- 
ing the kahilis before the tomb. He had the good taste to make one of them sub- 
stitute black crape for the ordinary hempen rope he was aboMt to tie one of them 
to the frame-work with. Finally he entered his carriage and drove away, and the 
populace shortly began to drop into his wake. While he was in view there was 
but one man who attracted more attention than himself, and that was Harris (the 
Yankee Prime Minister). This feeble personage had crape enough around his hat 
to express the grief of an entire nation, and as usual he neglected no opportunity 
of making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of the simple Kanakas. 
Oh ! noble ambition of this modern Richelieu ! 

It is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the 
Princess Victoria with those of her noted ancestor Kameha- 
meha the Conqueror, who died fifty years ago — in 1819, the 
year before the first missionaries came. 

"On the 8th of May, 1819, at the age of sixty-six, he died, as he had lived, in 
the faith of his country. It was his misfortune not to have come in contact 
with men who could have rightly influenced his religious aspirations. Judged by 
his advantages and compared with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be 
justly styled not only great, but good. To this day his memory warms the heart and 
elevates the national feelings of Hawaiians. They are proud of their old warrior 
King ; they love his name ; his deeds form then- historical age ; and an enthusiasm 
everywhere prevails, shared even by foreigner! who knew his worth, that consti- 
tutes the firmest pillar of the throne of his dynasty. 

" In lieu of human victims (the custom of that age), a sacrifice of three hundred 
dogs attended his obsequies — no mean holocaust when their national value and 
the estimation in which they were held are considered. The bones of Kameha- 
meha, after being kept for a while, were so carefully concealed that all knowledge 
of their final resting place is now lost. There was a proverb current among the 
common people that the bones of a cruel King could not be hid ; they made fish- 
hooks and arrows of them, upon which, in using them, they vented their abhor, 
rence of his memory in bitter execrations." 

The account of the circumstances of his death, as written 
by the native historians, is full of minute detail, but there is 
scarcely a line of it which does not mention or illustrate some 
by-gone custom of the country. In this respect it is the most 
comprehensive document I have yet met with. I will quote 
it entire : 

" When Kamehameha was dangerously sick, and the priests were unable to cure 
him, they said : 'Be of good courage and build a house for the god' (his own private god or idol), 
that thou mayest recover.' The chiefs corroborated this advice 
of the priests, and a place of worship was prepared for Kukailimoku, and conse- 
crated in the evening. They proposed also to the King, with a view to prolong 
his life, that human victims should be sacrificed to his deity ; upon which the 
greater part of the people absconded through fear of death, and concealed them- 
selves in hidiug places till the tabtt* in which destruction impended, was past. 
It is doubtful whether Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests 
to sacrifice men, as he was known to say, ' The men are sacred for the King ; ' 
meaning that they were for the service of his successor. This information was 
derived from Lihohho, his son. 

"After this, his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not strength to 
turn himself in his bed. When another season, consecrated for worship at the 
new temple {heian) arrived, he said to his son, Liholiho, ' Go thou and make sup- 
plication to thy god ; I am not able to go, and will offer my prayers at home.* 
When his devotions to his feathered god, Kukailimoku, were concluded, a certain 
religiously disposed individual, who had a bird god, suggested to the King that 
through its influence his sickness might be removed. The name of this god was 
Pua ; its body was made of a bird, now eaten by the Hawaiians, and called in 
their language aloe. Kamehameha was willing that a trial should be made, and 
two houses were constructed to facilitate the experiment ; but while dwelling in 
them he became so very weak as not to receive food. After lying there three 
days, his wives, children and chiefs, perceiving that he was very low, returned 
him to his own house. In the evening he was carried to the eating house,
