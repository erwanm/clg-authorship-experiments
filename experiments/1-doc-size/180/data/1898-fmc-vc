Gilbert lodged at tlie sign of the Lion, over 
against the tower of Nona, by the bridge of Sant' 
Angelo. The inn was as old as the times of Charle- 
magne, when it had been named in honour of Pope 
Leo, who had crowned him emperor. But the quarter 
was at that time in the hands of the great Jewish 
race of Pierleoni, whose first antipope, Anacletus, 
had not been dead many years, and who, though they 
still held the castle and many towers and fortresses 
in Rome, had not succeeded in imposing the antipope 
Victor upon the Roman people, against the will of 
Bernard of Clairvaux. 

Rome lay along the river, in those days, like 
wreckage and scum thrown up on the shore of a 
wintry sea. Some twenty thousand human beings 
were huddled together in smoky huts, most of which 
were built against the outer walls and towers of the 
nobles' strongholds — a miserable population, living 
squalidly in terrible times, starving while the nobles 
fought with one another, rising now and then like a 
vision of famine and sword to take back by force the 
right of life which force had almost taken from them. 
Gilbert wandered through the crooked, unpaved 
streets, in and out of gloomy courts and over deso- 
late wastes and open places, the haunts of ravenous 
dogs and homeless cats that kept themselves alive 
on the choice pickings of the city's garbage. He 







went armed and followed by his men, as he saw that 
other gentlemen of his condition did, and when ha 
knelt in a church to hear mass or to say a prayer, he 
was careful to kneel with his back to the wall or to 
a pillar, lest some light-handed worshipper should 
set a razor to his wallet strings or his sword-belt. 

At his inn, too, he lived in a state of armed defence 
against every one, including the host and the other 
guests; and the weekly settlement was a weekly 
battle between Dunstan, who paid his master's scores, 
the little Tuscan interpreter, and Ser Clemente, the 
innkeeper, in which the Tuscan had the most un- 
comfortable position, j&nding himself placed buffer- 
like between the honest man and the thief, and 
exposed to equally hard hitting from both. Rome 
was poor and dirty and a den of thieves, murderers, 
and all malefactors, dominated alternately by a family 
of half-converted Jews, who terrorized the city from 
strong points of vantage, and then, on other days, by 
the mob that followed Arnold of Brescia when he 
appeared in the city, and who would have torn down 
stone walls with their bare hands at his merest 
words, as they would have faced the barons' steel 
with naked breast. At such times men left their 
tasks — the shoemaker his last, the smith his anvil, 
the crooked tailor his bench — to follow the northern 
monk to the Capitol, or to some church where he was 
to speak to them ; and after the men came the women, 
and after the women the children, all drawn along 
by the mysterious attraction which they could 
neither understand nor resist. The tramping of 
many feet made a dull bass to the sound of many 




human voices, high and low, crying out lustily for 
'Arnold, a Senate, and the Roman Republic ' ; and 
then taking up the song of the day, which was a 
ballad of liberty, in a long minor chant that broke 
into a jubilant major in the burden — the sort of 
song the Romans have always made in time of change, 
the kind of ballad that goes before the end of a king- 
dom, like a warning voice of fate. 

On such days, when the mob went howling and 
singing after its idol, southwards to the Capitol 
or even to the far Lateran where Marcus Aurelius 
sat upon his bronze horse watching the ages go by, 
then Gilbert loved to wander in the opposite direc- 
tion, across the castle bridge and under the haunted 
battlements of Sant' Angelo, where evil Theodora's 
ghost walked on autumn nights when the south wind 
blew, and through the long wreck of the fair portico 
that had once extended from the bridge to the basilica, 
till he came to the broad flight of steps leading to the 
walled garden-court of old Saint Peter's. There he 
loved to sit musing among the cypresses, wondering 
at the vast bronze pine-cone and the great brass pea- 
cocks which Symmachus had brought thither from 
the ruins of Agrippa's baths, wherein the terrible 
Crescenzi had fortified themselves during more than 
a hundred years. Sitting there alone, while Dun- 
stan puzzled his uncertain learning over deep-cut 
inscriptions of long ago, and Alric, the groom, threw 
his dagger at a mark on one of the cj^ress trees, hun- 
dreds of times in succession, and rarely missing his 
aim, Gilbert felt, in the silence he loved, that the soul 
of Rome had taken hold of his soul, and that in Rom« 





it was good to live for the sake of dreaming, and that 
dreaming itself was life. The past, with his mother's 
sins, his own sorrows, the friendship of the boy 
Henry, the love of Queen Eleanor, were all infinitely 
far removed and dim. The future, once the magic 
mirror in which he had seen displayed the glory of 
knightly deeds which he was to do, was taken up 
like a departing vision into the blue Roman sky. 
Only the present remained, the idle, thoughtful, 
half-narcotic present, with a mazy charm no man 
could explain, since so far as any bodily good was 
concerned there was less comfort to be got for 
money, more fever to be taken for nothing, and a 
larger element of danger in everyday life in Rome 
than in any city Gilbert had traversed in his wander- 
ings. Yet he lingered and loved it rather for what 
it denied him than for what it gave him, for the 
thoughts it called up rather than for the sights it 
offered, for that in it which was unknown, and there- 
fore dear to dwell upon, rather than for the sadness 
and the darkness and the evil that all men might 
feel. 

But through all he felt, and in all he saw, welding 
and joining the whole together, there was the still 
fervour of that something which he had at first known 
in Sheering Abbey — something to which every fibre 
of his nature responded, and which, indeed, was 
the mainspring of the world in that age. For devo- 
tion was then more needful than bread, and it profited 
a man more to fight against unbelievers for his 
soul's sake than to wear hollows in altar-steps with 
his knees, or to forget his own name and put off 
his own proper character and being, as a nameless 
unit in a great religious order. 

At first the enormous disappointment of Rome had 
saddened and hurt him. He had fancied that where 
there was no head there could be no house, that 
where the leader was gone the army must scatter 
and be hewn in pieces. But as he stayed on, from 
week to week and from month to month, he learned 
to understand that the Church had never been more 
alive, more growing, and more militant than at that 
very time when the true and rightful pontiffs were 
made outcasts one after the other, while their places, 
earthly and spiritual, were given to instruments of 
feud and party. For the Church was the world, 
while Rome meant seven or eight thousand half- 
starved and turbulent ruffians, with their wives and 
children, eager always for change, because it seemed 
that no change could be for the worse. 

But in the ancient basilica of Saint Peter there was 
peace ; there the white-haired priests solemnly offici- 
ated in the morning and at noon, and toward evening 
more than a hundred rich voices of boys and men 
sang the vesper psalms in the Gregorian tones; 
there slim youths in violet and white swung silver 
censers before the high altar, and the incense floated 
in rich clouds upon the sunbeams that fell slanting 
to the ancient floor ; there, as in many a minster 
and cloister of the world, the Church was still her- 
self, as she was, and is, and always will be; there 
words were spoken and solemn prayers intoned which 
had been familiar to the lips of the Apostles, which 
are familiar to our lips and ears to-day, and of
