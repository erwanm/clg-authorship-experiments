the strength we shall need hereafter for a great 
victory." 

"The Emperor will surely be here to-morrow, 
without our help," said the King, in manifest dis- 
content. " It is of no use to go and meet him. " 

"If he is so near, let us mount to-night, this 





very hour, rather than have on us the shame of lying 
idly here while men who wear the cross are in need 
of us." 

The King said nothing, but at Eleanor's words a 
low murmur of assent ran through the assembly 
of brave men, from those at her feet to those 
farthest from her; and the impatient touch of each 
hand on sword or dagger, at the thought of fight, 
made a sound of softly moving steel and leather 
and buckle, which one may only hear among soldiers. 

Eleanor stood up, untired by her terrible ride, 
unshaken by her fall, her eyes full of the bright- 
ness of pride. It was her daily food and her 
perpetual necessity to have the better of the King 
in the eyes of men, whether the matter were great or 
small. She stood up to her height, as if to show all 
her beauty and strength to the world, and the low 
sun streamed through the wide entrance to the tent 
and fell full upon her face and her unblinking 
eyes. 

"My lords and barons, gentlemen of Guienne and 
France, our journey is over to-day, our battles begin 
to-morrow ! Our brothers are in danger, the enemy 
is in sight ! Men of the Cross, to arms ! " 

" To arms ! " rang the reply in many voices, both 
high and deep, like a major chord sounding from 
the heart. 

As she rose, the nobles had risen, too, and only 
the King kept his seat, his pale face bent, his hands 
folded upon the hilt of the sword that stood between 
his knees. The Queen said no more, and, without 
glancing at her husband, as if she alone were sover- 



eign, she descended the two steps from the throne 
to the floor of the tent. Three knights, one of Gas- 
cony, one of Poitou, and one of her own Guienne, 
who were her guard of honour, followed her as she 
passed out, smiling to the great nobles on her right 
and left. And many showed that they desired to 
speak with her — first among them the Count of 
Montferrat. 

"Madam," he said, when he had bowed low before 
her, "I praise God and the Holy Trinity that your 
Grace is alive to-day. I pray that you will deign 
to accept the homage and felicitations of Mont- 
ferrat ! " 

"Of Bourbon, Madam! " cried a voice beside her. 

" Of Savoy, your Grace ! " said another. 

" Of Coucy, of Courtenay, of Metz — " the voices 
all rang at once, as the lords pressed round her, for 
she had not been seen since she had left the field 
after her fall. 

" I thank you," she answered, with a careless smile. 
" But you should ihank also the man who saved my 
life, if you love me." 

"Madam, we have," replied Montferrat. "And if 
youx Grace will but let me have the man, I will 
do him much honour for your Highness's sake." 

"He is no vassal of mine," Eleanor said. "He 
is a poor English gentleman, cheated of his lands, 
a friend of young Henry Plantagenet. " 

"The friend of a boy!" The Count laughed' 
lightly. 

But Eleanor grew thoughtful on a sudden, for 
beyond her rare beauty and her splendid youth, and 





within her world of impatient passion, there were 
wisdom and knowledge of men. 

"A boy? Yes, he may be fourteen years old, 
not more. But there are boys who are not children, 
even in their cradles, and there are men who are 
nothing else — their swaddling-clothes outgrown, 
and their milk teeth cast, but not their whimpering 
and fretting." 

The nobles were silent, for she spoke over-boldly 
and meant the King, as they knew. 

"As for this Englishman," she continued after 
an instant's pause, " he is not mine to give you, my 
lord Count. And as for doing him honour for his 
brave deed, though I would gladly please you, I 
should be loth to let you do my duty for your 
pleasure. " 

She smiled again very graciously, for she waa 
glad that men should praise Gilbert Warde to her ; 
and it was strangely pleasant to think that no one 
guessed half of what she would give him if he 
would take it. For among the nobles there were 
great lords, goodly men and young, who dreamed of 
her fair face, but would not have dared to lift up 
their eyes to her. 

So she passed out, with her knights behind her, 
and most of the lords and barons followed her at 
a -distance, leaving the King within. 

When she was gone he rose slowly, and giving 
his sword to the chamberlain who stood waiting, he 
went to his chapel tent, with downcast eyes and 
clasped hands, as if walking in a solemn procession. 
A little bell rang, the sun was low, and it was the 



 

hour of the Benediction. The King knelt down 
before the rich altar, and when he had prayed ear- 
nestly for strength and courage, and for wisdom to 
win the war of the Cross, he prayed from the bottom 
of his unhappy heart that, if it were the will of 
Heaven, he might by some means be delivered from 
the woman of Belial who marred his life and bur- 
dened his soul. 



CHAPTER XVI 

To the south side of the camp the Germans came 
by thousands, all that day and far into the night, 
weary, half starved, on jaded beasts that could hardly 
set one foot before the other, or on foot themselves, 
reeling like men drunk, and almost blind with ex- 
haustion. But the panic had not lasted long, for 
the few score of Seljuk riders who had fallen upon 
the van of the retreating column for the last time had 
been finally scattered by the Duke of Suabia, so that 
the remainder of the army came in with a show of 
order, bringing the greater part of the baggage. 
The Seljuks had not attempted to carry away plun- 
der, which would have hampered them in their 
dashing charges and instant retreats. 

Last of all, before daybreak, came the Emperor 
himself, covering the rear of his army with chosen 
men, untired, though his great horse was staggering 
under him, alert and strong as if he had not been 
in the saddle the better part of four days and nights. 
He seemed a man of iron ; and few could ride with 
him, or watch with him, or fight with him. 

When the sun rose, the great standard of the Holy 
Roman Empire waved before the imperial tent, and
