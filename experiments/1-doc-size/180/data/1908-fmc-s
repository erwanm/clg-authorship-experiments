life, only because he had spoken two or three times to me on the voyage.
The ship was not going on fast, but though one of the sailors threw him
a rope he could not catch it, for he was holding up my head and telling
me not to be frightened, as well as he could amongst the waves, and not
to catch hold of him, for he would save me. Then the passengers and
sailors took a great board ten ells long that was on the deck, and
served for landing, and they threw it over; and somehow the Maestro got
me to it and we climbed upon it, while the ship was getting farther and
farther away, and the black squall was coming nearer and nearer.'
'The master swims like a water-rat,' said Pina. 'I remember that night
in Venice, when the Signors of the Night were after him!'
'Ah, you should have seen him in the sea, God bless him!' answered
Cucurullo. 'He had the strength and the long wind of a dolphin. When the
squall came upon us we held each other fast, sitting astride of the
plank, for it was a very heavy one, and did not sink with us. Then came
the rain. Lord, how it rained, Donna Pina! You have never seen rain like
that!'
'I remember how it rained that night when the master climbed into our
balcony! That was enough for me!'
'Imagine ten times that, Donna Pina. The wind had blown the plank round,
so that we got the rain in our backs, but even then I had to keep my
mouth shut to hinder the water from running down my throat! And it must
have lasted two hours, but the sea went down like magic in that time,
and there was only a long, smooth, swelling motion, and the wind came
from another quarter and carried us with it. That was how we were
saved.'
'The ship came back and picked you up, I suppose?'
'After the squall we did not see the ship again, though the clouds
rolled away and the sun shone brightly. She went to the bottom of the
sea, Donna Pina, and was never heard of again, but we drifted for many
hours, half dead with cold, and were washed upon the Roman shore.'
'And what was fated, happened,' said Pina with a smile. 'For if you had
not been thrown overboard you would have been drowned with the rest, Sor
Antonino!'
Cucurullo smiled too, very quietly, and helped Pina to the last
drumstick left over from a cold chicken.
'Well, well, Donna Pina,' he said, 'that is your way of believing, I
dare say, but I have told you what happened to me; and now you will
understand better why I should be glad to serve the master with my life,
if I might.'
'You are a good man,' said Pina in a thoughtful tone. 'If there were
more like you, this would not be such a bad world as it is. What you say
about Don Alberto is true, and if I could see any way of being useful in
watching him I would do all I could. Are the two Venetian gentlemen who
helped us in Ferrara still in Rome? I do not know what they are, and
sometimes I was afraid of them, but they would be strong allies if they
knew that our lady was in danger and if they were willing to help us.'
'They are still in Rome, for I saw them only to-day, going into the
Ges√π. They must be very devout gentlemen, for I often see them in
churches, and their servant has been valet to a bishop, and understands
the ceremonials perfectly. It is a pleasure to talk with him. He can
tell the meaning of every vestment and of every change in a pontifical
high mass, and I think he knows half the Roman Breviary by heart, and
all the Psalms!'
Pina was not so sure about the piety of the Bravi and their servant, and
as she nibbled her last bit of bread, she looked thoughtfully across the
clothless deal table at the hunchback's trusting and spiritual face. In
the dramatic vicissitudes of her own youth she had not learned to put
her faith in men, nor in women either; and if there had ever been a
gentle and affectionate side to her strong nature, it had been trodden
and tormented till it had died, leaving scarcely a memory of itself
behind.
As he sat on the kitchen chair, Cucurullo's head was not much above the
edge of the table, and she looked down at him, meeting his sad eyes as
they gazed up to hers. She liked him, and was glad that he did not know
what was passing through her mind; for she foresaw trouble in the near
future, and was afraid for herself. In some way she might yet be made to
pay for what she had done in wreaking her vengeance on Pignaver.
Cardinal Altieri might protect Stradella and Ortensia if the Senator
tried to have them murdered, but if he demanded that Pina, his household
servant, should be arrested and sent back to Venice to be punished for
helping the runaways, who would protect her? At the mere thought she
often turned very pale and bent nearly double, as if she felt bodily
pain. For of all things, she feared that most. Sooner than suffer it
again she would betray Ortensia into Alberto Altieri's hands, as she had
almost forced her into Stradella's arms in order to be revenged on
Pignaver himself.
'I have been thinking,' she said after a long pause. 'It would be well
for you to go to those Venetian gentlemen and beg them to help us, if
they will. You need not say that I suggested it, Sor Antonino.'
'Why should I speak of you at all, Donna Pina?' asked the hunchback, a
little surprised.
'Exactly! There is no need of it, and you are very tactful. You will
find out if they suspect anything, for after the affair of the serenade
I am sure that they must have watched Don Alberto anxiously, to be sure
that he had not found out who wounded him.'
'Perhaps I had better talk to Tommaso first. We are on very good terms,
you know.'
'By all means, talk with him first.'
A distant handbell tinkled, and as Pina heard it through the open door
she rose to her feet, for it was Ortensia's means of calling her.
Cucurullo thought over the conversation and reasoned about it with
himself most of the night, and, so far as Pina was concerned, the more
he reflected the farther he got from the truth. For he was grateful
because she was kind to him in their daily life, and he could not
possibly have believed that she was no more really attached to Ortensia
than she was to the Queen of Sweden, and was even now meditating a
sudden flight from Rome, which should put her beyond the reach of
justice, if the law ever made search for her. In his heart he was sure
that she must be as devoted to her mistress as he was to Stradella,
though it was true that Ortensia had never saved her life. But Cucurullo
saw good in every one, and thought it the most natural thing in the
world that a faithful servant should be ready to die for his master.
On the following day he lay in wait for Tommaso near the main entrance
of the inn, where the Via dell' Orso meets the Via di Monte Brianzo,
which then bore the name of Santa Lucia.
It was long before the man appeared, and then he seemed to be in a great
hurry, and did not see Cucurullo till the latter overtook him and spoke
to him, for the hunchback had long legs and could walk quite as fast as
any able-bodied young man.
'I have been waiting a long time in the hope of seeing you this
morning,' he said.
'And now I am in such haste that I have no time to talk with you,'
replied the other, going on.
'We can talk while we are walking,' suggested Cucurullo, keeping pace
with him easily. 'How are the masters, Tommaso? Quite well, I hope?'
'Oh, perfectly well, thank you,' answered Tommaso, increasing his speed.
'I am sorry that I am in such a hurry, my friend, but it cannot be
helped.'
'Do not mention it,' said Cucurullo, breathing quietly. 'I generally
walk briskly myself.' Thereupon he quickened his stride a little.
'You certainly walk surprisingly fast,' said the ex-highwayman, who now
had to make an effort himself in order to keep up with his companion.
The people in the street stared at the two in surprise, for they seemed
to be walking for a match, and it looked as if the hunchback were
getting the better of it.
'I trust,' he said in a quiet undertone, 'that Count Trombin is in no
apprehension owing to his having wounded the Pope's nephew under our
windows the other night?'
'Not at all,' answered the other. 'So you saw it, did you?'
'I saw it with satisfaction, for I was at the window, and I recognised
the Count's voice at once. What do you think, my friend? Will that young
gentleman come serenading again?'
'How can I tell?' Tommaso was by this time a little short of breath.
'You might have heard your two gentlemen say something about it,'
Cucurullo said. 'Am I walking too fast for you? You said you were in a
hurry, you know.'
'Yes,' Tommaso said, rather breathlessly. 'I was--that is--I am in--in a
moderate hurry!'
'My reason for going with you is that I want your valuable advice,'
Cucurullo went on, still keeping up the tremendous pace without the
least apparent difficulty.
'About what?' gasped the highwayman, ashamed to be beaten by a
hunchback.
'Your gentlemen have already helped my master and mistress so much, that
even without the Maestro's knowledge I should like to ask their
protection for his wife. That is, if you approve, my friend. I want your
advice, you see.'
'You will have to--to walk slower--if you--want to get it!'
Tommaso was by this time puffing like a porpoise, for he was not as
young as when he had been the terror of the Bologna road, and he had
been living on the fat of his masters' plentiful leavings for weeks,
with a very liberal allowance of the white wine of Marino. Moreover,
knowing what he did of the Bravi's intentions, Cucurullo's suggestion
seemed at once highly comic and extremely valuable. But Cucurullo
himself, good soul, was pleased at having forced Tommaso to slacken his
pace and listen to him.
'I come of my own intention, dear friend,' he said, 'because I am in
constant anxiety about the Lady Ortensia. For Don Alberto is nephew to
both the Popes, as they say here, and it would be an easy matter for
him to carry her off into the country; the more so as she and my master
are living in his own palace, and it sometimes happens that the Maestro
goes out alone to a rehearsal of music, leaving only me and Pina to
protect his lady, and what could we do if Don Alberto came at such a
time with a band of men and simply carried the lady downstairs to his
own coach and drove away with her?'
'My dear friend,' answered the other, who had now recovered his breath,
'I do not know what you could do. Am I a prophet, that you ask me
riddles? The book of wisdom is buried under the statue of Pasquin, as
these Romans say! If such a thing happened to me, I should consider the
safety of my own skin, which is worth more to me than many other skins,
even than the skins of lions for which His Holiness pays a great price,
they tell me, when travellers bring them from Africa! For you might as
well resist the Tiber in a flood, as try to hinder the Pope's favourite
nephew from doing what he likes! Not that the Pope, or even the
Cardinal, knows what he does; but he has a golden key to every door in
Rome, a papal pass for every gate of the city, and a roll of blank
pardons, duly signed and sealed, for any misdeed his servants may
commit! What could you or I do against such a man?'
Having had his haste fairly run out of his legs, Tommaso was now
