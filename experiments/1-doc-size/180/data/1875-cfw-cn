" In the kingdom down by the sea 
Lived the beautiful Annabel Lee," 

I quoted, sotto voce. 

" And what very remarkable feet had she ! " added 
Raymond, improvising under the inspiration of cer- 
tain shoes, scow-like in shape, gigantic in length and 
breadth, which had made themselves visible at the 
top round of the ladder. 

At length the shabby old boat got under way, and 
we followed in its path, turning off to the right 
through a network of channels, now pulling our- 
selves along by the reeds, now paddling over a raft 

 



 

of lily-pads, now poling through a winding labyrinth, 
and now rowing with broad sweeps across the little 
lake. The sun was sinking, and the western sky 
grew bright at his coming ; there was not a cloud 
to make mountain-peaks on the horizon, nothing but 
the level earth below meeting the curved sky above, 
so evenly and clearly that it seemed as though we 
could go out there and touch it with our hands. 
Soon we lost sight of the little lighthouse ; then 
one by one the distant sails sank down and disap- 
peared, and we were left alone on the grassy sea, 
rowing toward the sunset. 

"We must have come a mile or two, and there is 
no sign of a house," I called out to our guide. 

"Well, I don't pretend to know how far it is, 
exactly," replied Liakim; "we don't know how far 
anything is here in the Flats, we don't." 

" But are you sure you know the way ? " 

"O my, yes! We've got most to the boy. There 
it is!" 

The " boy " was a buoy, a fragment of plank painted 
white, part of the cabin- work of some wrecked steamer. 

"Now, then," said Liakim, pausing, "you jest go 
straight on in this here channel till you come to the 
ninth run from this boy, on the right ; take that, and 
it will lead you right up to Waiting Samuel's door." 

" Aren't you coming with us ? " 

"Well, no. In the first place, Eosabel Lee will be 




waiting supper for me, and she don't like to wait ; and, 
besides, Samuel can't abide to see none of us round his 
part of the Flats." 

"But " I began. 

"Let him go," interposed Kaymond; "we can find 
the house without trouble." And he tossed a silver dol- 
lar to the little man, who was already turning his boat. 

" Thank you," said Liakim. " Be sure you take the 
ninth run and no other, the ninth run from this boy. 
If you make any mistake, you 'll find yourselves miles 
away." 

With this cheerful statement, he began to row back. 
I did not altogether fancy being left on the watery 
waste without a guide ; the name, too, of our mythic 
host did not bring up a certainty of supper and beds. 
" Waiting Samuel," I repeated, doubtfully. " What is 
he waiting for?" I called back over my shoulder; 
for Raymond was rowing. 

" The judgment-day ! " answered Liakim, in a shrill 
key. The boats were now far apart ; another turn, and 
we were alone. 

We glided on, counting the runs on the right : some 
were wide, promising rivers ; others wee little rivulets ; 
the eighth was far away ; and, when we had passed it, 
we could hardly decide whether we had reached the 
ninth or not, so small was the opening, so choked with 
weeds, showing scarcely a gleam of water beyond when 
we stood up to inspect it. 




" It is certainly the ninth, and I vote that we try it. 
It will do as well as another, and I, for one, am in no 
hurry to arrive anywhere," said Eaymond, pushing the 
boat in among the reeds. 

" Do you want to lose yourself in this wilderness ? " 
I asked, making a flag of my handkerchief to mark the 
spot where we had left the main stream. 

" I think we are lost already," was the calm reply. 
I began to fear we were. 

For some distance the "run," as Liakim called it, 
continued choked with aquatic vegetation, which acted 
like so many devil-fish catching our oars ; at length it 
widened and gradually gave us a clear channel, albeit 
so winding and erratic that the glow of the sunset, our 
only beacon, seemed to be executing a waltz all round 
the horizon. At length we saw a dark spot on the left, 
and distinguished the outline of a low house. " There 
it is," I said, plying my oars with renewed strength. 
But the run turned short off in the opposite direction, 
and the house disappeared. After some time it rose 
again, this time on our right, but once more the run 
turned its back and shot off on a tangent. The sun 
had gone, and the rapid twilight of September was falling 
around us ; the air, however, -was singularly clear, 
and, as there was absolutely nothing to make a shadow, 
the darkness came on evenly over the level green. I 
was growing anxious, when a third time the house ap- 
peared, but the wilful run passed by it, although so near 



 

that we could distinguish its open windows and door. 
" Why not get out and wade across ? " I suggested. 

" According to Liakim, it is the duty of this run to 
take us to the very door of Waiting Samuel's mansion, 
and it shall take us," said Raymond, rowing on. It did. 

Doubling upon itself in the most unexpected man- 
ner, it brought us back to a little island, where the tall 
grass had given way to a vegetable-garden. We landed, 
secured our boat, and walked up the pathway toward 
the house. In the dusk it seemed to be a low, square 
structure, built of planks covered with plaster; the 
roof was flat, the windows unusually broad, the door 
stood open, but no one appeared. We knocked. A 
voice from within called out, " Who are you, and what 
do you want with Waiting Samuel ? " 

" Pilgrims, asking for food and shelter," replied Ray- 
mond. 

" Do you know the ways of righteousness ? " 

" We can learn them." 

" Will you conform to the rules of this household 
without murmuring ? " 

"We will." 

" Enter then, and peace be with you ! " said the 
voice, drawing nearer. We stepped cautiously through 
the dark passage into a room, whose open windows let 
in sufficient twilight to show us a shadowy figure. 
" Seat yourselves," it said. We found a bench, and sat 
down. 



 

" What seek ye here ? " continued the shadow.
