" No ; we have left Chicago. Mrs. Rogers has 
merely remained to finish up a little packing." 

" Oh, indeed ! Are you coming back to Boston ?" 

" I cannot say as yet. We some think of so 
doing." 

Lapham turned away and looked up at the build 
ing. His wife pulled a little at her glove, as if 
embarrassed, or even pained. She tried to make a 
diversion. 

" We are building a house," she said, with a 
meaningless laugh. 

" Oh, indeed," said Mr. Rogers, looking up at it. 

Then no one spoke again, and she said helplessly 

" If you come to Boston, I hope I shall see Mrs. 
Rogers." 

" She will be happy to have you call," said Mr. 
Rogers. 

He touched his hat-brim, and made a bow forward 
rather than in Mrs. Lapham's direction. 

She mounted the planking that led into the shelter 
of the bare brick walls, and her husband slowly 



 

followed. When she turned her face toward him 
her cheeks were burning, and tears that looked hot 
stood in her eyes. 

" You left it all to me ! " she cried. " Why couldn't 
you speak a word ?" 

"I hadn't anything to say to him," replied Lapham 
sullenly. 

They stood a while, without looking at the work 
which they had come to enjoy, and without speaking 
to each other. 

" I suppose we might as well go on," said Mrs. 
Lapham at last, as they returned to the buggy. The 
Colonel drove recklessly toward the Milldam. His 
wife kept her veil down and her face turned from 
him. After a time she put her handkerchief up 
under her veil and wiped her eyes, and he set his 
teeth and squared his jaw. 

" I don't see how he always manages to appear 
just at the moment when he seems to have gone 
fairly out of our lives, and blight everything," she 
whimpered. 

" I supposed he was dead," said Lapham. 

" Oh, don't say such a thing ! It sounds as if you 
wished it." 

" Why do you mind it ? What do you let him 
blight everything for ? " 

" I can't help it, and I don't believe I ever shall. 
I don't know as his being dead would help it any. 
I can't ever see him without feeling just as I did at 
first." 

" I tell you," said Lapham, " it was a perfectly 



 

square thing. And I wish, once for all, you would 
quit bothering about it. My conscience is easy as 
far as he 's concerned, and it always was." 

" And I can't look at him without feeling as if 
you 'd ruined him, Silas." 

" Don't look at him, then," said her husband, with 
a scowl. " I want you should recollect in the first 
place, Persis, that I never wanted a partner." 

" If he hadn't put his money in when he did, 
ou'd 'a' broken down." 

" Well, he got his money out again, and more, 
too," said the Colonel, with a sulky weariness. 

" He didn't want to take it out." 

" I gave him his choice : buy out or go out." 

" You know he couldn't buy out then. It was no 
choice at all." 

" It was a business chance." 

"No; you had better face the truth, Silas. It 
was no chance at all. You crowded him out. A 
man that had saved you ! No, you had got greedy, 
Silas. You had made your paint your god, and you 
couldn't bear to let anybody else share in its bless 
ings." 

" I tell you he was a drag and a brake on me 
from the word go. You say he saved me. Well, if 
I hadn't got him out he 'd 'a' ruined me sooner or 
later. So it's an even thing, as far forth as that 
goes." 

" No, it ain't an even thing, and you know it, 
Silas. Oh, if I could only get you once to acknow 
ledge that you did wrong about it, then I should 



 

have some hope. I don't say you meant wrong , 
exactly, but you took an advantage. Yes, you took 
an advantage ! You had him where he couldn't help 
himself, and then you wouldn't show him any 
mercy." 

" I 'm sick of this,'' said Lapham. " If you 'll 
'tend to the house, I 'll manage my business without 
your help." 

" You were very glad of my help once." 
" Well, I 'm tired of it now. Don't meddle." 
" I will meddle. When I see you hardening 
yourself in a wrong thing, it 's time for me to 
meddle, as you call it, and I will. I can't ever get 
you to own up the least bit about Rogers, and I feel 
as if it was hurting you all the while." 

" What do you want I should own up about a 
thing for when I don't feel wrong ? I tell you 
Rogers hain't got anything to complain of, and that 's 
what I told you from the start. It 's a thing that 's 
done every day. I was loaded up with a partner 
that didn't know anything, and couldn't do anything, 
and I unloaded; that's all." 

" You unloaded just at the time when you knew 
that your paint was going to be worth about twice 
what it ever had been ; and you wanted all the 
advantage for yourself." 

" I had a right to it. I made the success." 
"Yes, you made it with Rogers's money; and 
when you'd made it you took his share of it. I 
guess you thought of that when you saw him, and 
that's why you couldn't look him in the face." 



 

At these words Lapham lost his temper. 

" I guess you don't want to ride with me any 
more to-day," he said, turning the mare abruptly 
round. 

" I 'm as ready to go back as what you are," re 
plied his wife. " And don't you ask me to go to 
that house with you any more. You can sell it, for
