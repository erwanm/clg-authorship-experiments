‘‘ You see I’ve brought her home safe. Now 
what are you going to pay me? ” 

The small faces were aghast. 

You didn’t say anything about pay,” declared 
Chan, with sudden courage. ‘‘ You just said 
you’d surely bring her home.” 

“ I wasn’t a bit sharp about bargain-making, 
was I ? ” and he laughed. 

“ I’ll div’ you my dolly,” proffered Laurel, who 
looked at least a year or two younger than her 
twin, and was backward about talking plainly; 
but her mother liked the baby words. 

“Oh, Laurel, for shame! That dirty thing!” 
and Prim snatched it away and threw it toward 
the house. Then it was Laurel’s turn to cry. Tip 
looked at her in disdain. 

“ Never mind, dear, the gentleman will know 
it came from your heart, and that it was some- 
thing you cherished. Everybody wouldn’t want 
to give away what they loved best. You’re not 
used to children,” turning to him, “ so you must 
excuse them. And I am a thousand times 
obliged to you. Marigold, you might get him a 
posy.” 

“ And if you don’t object I’ll come over some 
day and take the younger ones out for a drive. 
Occasionally I get a sort of lonesome feeling.” 


 

“Oh, you are very good!’’ and Mrs. Firth 
raised her soft, sweet eyes. 

Marigold handed up the posy. Some roses and 
very beautiful china pinks. 

“ Though I suppose you have plenty of 
flowers ” 

“But these are wonderful La France roses! 
Why, they are really finer than mine.” 

“ Father used to take such pains with them. 
You see, Fve only such a little time, and then I 
don’t know about them as he did,” Mrs. Firth 
said deprecatingly. 

“ I must come over and look at the garden. 
Thank you. And now — be good children.” 

He was going to add “ and love your mother,’' 
but he knew there was no need, and he had a 
strangely awkward feeling as he drove away. 
He would like to know them real well, but he 
didn’t just understand how to get about it. They 
would go out in the kitchen and have some dinner, 
never dreaming that for years he had eaten in the 
kitchen off cheap, common ware, hurrying through 
his meals. 

Then he wondered about the little lame boy. 
He looked more delicate than the others. Couldn’t 
something be done for him? 

Eight children for one little mother! And so 


 

many houses where there were no children ! And 
so many children in the asylums ! So many little 
waifs never knowing what love meant. Why, he 
had not really known how much it was to them 
until he had come to know the Rosses intimately. 

Not that these children had any lack. But what 
would the little mother do when they began to 
grow up? They would have few chances for edu- 
cation, few opportunities for advancement. They 
all seemed so bright, too. But often it was the 
helping hand that assisted one in finding his place. 
A helping hand had been held out to him. He had 
seen the possibilities in John Ross. And now — 
why, there were hundreds of people in the world 
who needed this kindly assistance, who might be 
useful and honored instead of dropping down in 
discouragement. The children were to be the 
next generation of men and women. 

The little group left behind watched the wagon 
out of sight in spite of the old adage of bad luck. 

“ Isn’t he just splendid ! ” exclaimed Amaryllis. 
‘‘But such a funny name! Mr. Mann! Of 
course he’s a man.” 

“ Oh, Tip, do let go ! You’ll drag the clothes off 
me and tear my veil, like as not ! ” said his mother, 
unclasping the small hands that seemed to have 
so much strength. 


 

‘‘ Me, too, mommy ! Me ’ants a hug,” and 
Laurel caught her skirt. 

“ Children, let me go and change my dress. It’s 
my best one, and goodness only knows when I’ll 
get another. And then I’ll tell you everything. * 
I’m glad enough to get back, just as glad as you 
are.” 

She made her way through the group, but Rilla 
ran in to look after the dinner, as there was a 
suspicious smell of beans burning. On one side 
of the hall were two rooms, both used for sleep- 
ing apartments. The front one was the larger, 
and had an old-fashioned, much-carved, high-post 
bedstead and a trundle bed that was pushed about 
halfway under in the daytime. A bureau, an old 
cedar chest, and two chairs completed the fur- 
niture. The floor was painted and some rag rugs 
laid down beside the beds. 

She took off her hat and brushed the dust out 
of that, shook her veil and folded it carefully, 
laying both in the chest. Then from the closet 
she took her everyday calico gown and hung her 
black one out of the window, meaning to look 
after it presently. 

“ Dinner’s ready,” announced Marigold. “ Oh, 
mommy, you can’t think how lonesome it was last 
night. And that owl came and hollered.” 


 

“Well, you weren’t afraid of the old owl!” 

“ Not afraid, of course ” 

Linn came in breathless. “ Oh, I hoped you 
wouldn’t have eaten your dinner I Mis’ Briggs had 
a b’iled dinner with everything in it, and it was 
lickin’ good, I tell you ! And she said, ‘ Linn, you 
just run over home with this chunk of pork. — It’ll 
go good.’ ” 

This room was quite long, and was sitting-room 
and dining-room, with the lower end devoted to 
kitchen purposes, though in the summer they 
cooked out in a sort of shed kitchen. The table 
was covered with an enameled cloth, the dishes 
were a rather motley array, but the children were 
all clean now. 

As Linn was talking, he uncovered the kettle 
at Rilla’s elbow and she took out a tempting piece 
of pork, at which the children set up a shriek of 
delight. They were never quite as badly off as 
the old woman’s children, for they always had 
bread if they did not have broth. But meat was 
more of a rarity. It looked appetizing enough 
set in the great platter of green beans and corn. 

“ And how about the fortune, mother ! They 
were all crazy to know over to the store.” 

“ I don’t think there’ll be much fortune. One
