failure to catch Del Ferice when the latter had escaped from 
Rome in the disguise of a mendicant friar. Anastase had 
never been able to understand how he had missed the 
fugitive. It had soon become known that Del Ferice had 
escaped by the very pass which Gouache was patrolling, and 
the young Zouave had. felt the bitterest mortification in 
losing so valuable and so easy a prey. He often thought of 
it and promised himself that he would visit his anger on Del 
Ferice if he ever got a chance ; but Del Ferice was out of 
reach of his vengeance, and Donna Tullia Mayer had not 
returned to Koine since the previous year. It had been 
rumoured of late that she had at last fulfilled the engagement 
contracted some time earlier, and had consented to be called 
the Contessa Del Ferice ; this piece of news, however, was 
not yet fully confirmed. Gouache had heard the gossip, and 
had immediately made a lively sketch on the back of a half- 
finished picture, representing Donna Tullia, in her bridal 
dress, leaning upon the arm of Del Ferice, who was arrayed 
in a capuchin's cowl, and underneath, with his brush, he 
scrawled a legend, ' Finis coronat opus.' 

It was nearly six o'clock in the afternoon of the 23d of 
September. The day had been rainy, but the sky had 
cleared an hour before sunset, and there was a sweet damp 
freshness in the air, very grateful after the long weeks of 
late summer. Anastase Gouache had been on duty at the 
Serristori barracks in the Borgo Santo Spirito and walked 
briskly up to the bridge of Sant' Angelo. There was not 
much movement in the streets, and the carriages were few. 
A couple of officers were lounging at the gate of the castle 
and returned Gouache's salute as he passed. In the middle 
of the bridge he stopped and looked westward, down the 
short reach of the river which caught a lurid reflection of 
the sunset on its eddying yellow surface. He mused a 
moment, thinking more of the details of his duty at the 
barracks than of the scene before him. Then he thought of 
the first time he had crossed the bridge in his Zouave 
uniform, and a faint smile flickered on his brown features. 
It happened almost every day that he stopped at the same 
place, and as particular spots often become associated with 
ideas that seem to belong to them, the same thought almost 
always recurred to his mind as he stood there. Then fol 
lowed the same daily wondering as to how all these things 
were to end ; whether he should for years to come wear 
the red sash and the yellow gwters, a corporal of Zouaves, 




and whether for years he should ask himself every day 
the same question. Presently, as the light faded from the 
houses of the Borgo, he turned away with an imperceptible 
shrug of the shoulders and continued his walk upon the 
narrow pavement at the side of the bridge. As he descended 
the step at the end, to the level of the square, a small bright 
object in a crevice of the stones attracted his attention. He 
stooped and picked it up. 

It was a little gold pin, some two inches long, the head 
beaten out and twisted into the shape of the letter C. 
Gouache examined it attentively, and saw that it must have 
been long used, for it was slightly bent in more than one 
place as though it had often been thrust through some thick 
material. It told no other tale of its possessor, however, 
and the young man slipped it into his pocket and went on 
his way, idly wondering to whom the thing belonged. He 
reflected that if he had been bent on any important matter he 
would probably have considered the finding of a bit of gold 
as a favourable omen ; but he was merely returning to his 
lodging as usual, and had no engagement for the evening. 
Indeed, he expected no event in his life at that time, and 
following the train of his meditation he smiled a little when 
he thought that he was not even in love. For a Frenchman, 
nearly thirty years of age, the position was an unusual one 
enough. In Gouache's case it was especially remarkable. 
Women liked him, he liked them, and he was constantly in 
the society of some of the most beautiful in the world. 
Nevertheless, he turned from one to another and found a 
like pleasure in the conversation of them all. What 
delighted him in the one was not what charmed him most 
in the next, but the equilibrium of satisfaction was well 
maintained between the dark and the fair, the silent beauty 
and the pretty woman of intelligence. There was indeed one 
whom he thought more noble in heart and grander in 
symmetry of form and feature, and stronger in mind than 
the rest ; but she was immeasurably removed from the 
sphere of his possible devotion by her devoted love of her 
husband, and he admired her from a distance, even while 
speaking with her. 



As he passed the Apollo theatre and ascended the Via 
di Tordinona the lights were beginning to twinkle in the low 
doorways, and the gas-lamps, then a very recent innovation 
in Rome, shone out one by one in the distance. The street 
is narrow, and was full of traffic, even in the evening. Pedes 
trians elbowed their way along in the dusk, every now and 
then flattening themselves against the dingy walls to let a 
cab or a carriage rush past them, not without real risk of 
accident. Before the deep, arched gateway of the Orso, one 
of the most ancient inns in the world, the empty wine-carts 
were getting ready for the return journey by night across the 
Campagna, the great bunches of little bells jingling loudly in 
the dark as the carters buckled the harness on their horses' 
backs. 

Just as Gouache reached this place, the darkest and most 
crowded through which he had to pass, a tremendous clatter 
and rattle from the Via dell' Orso made the hurrying people 
draw back to the shelter of the doorsteps and arches. It 
was clear that a runaway horse was not far off. One of the 
carters, the back of whose waggon was half-way across the 
opening of the street, made desperate efforts to make his 
beast advance and clear the way ; but the frightened animal 
only backed farther up. A moment later the runaway 
charged down past the tail of the lumbering vehicle. The 
horse himself just cleared the projecting timbers of the cart, 
but the cab he was furiously dragging caught upon them 
while going at full speed and was shivered to pieces, 
throwing the horse heavily upon the stones, so that he slid 
along several feet on his head and knees with the fragments 
of the broken shafts and the wreck of the harness about him. 
The first man to spring from the crowd and seize the beast's 
head was Anastase. He did not see that the same instant a 
large private carriage, drawn by a pair of powerful horses, 
emerged quickly from the Vicolo dei Soldati, the third of 
the streets which meet the Via di Tordinona at the Orso. 
The driver, who owing to the darkness had not seen the 
disaster which had just taken place, did his best to stop in 
time ; but before the heavy equipage could be brought to a 
stand Anastase had been thrown to the ground, between the 





hoofs of the struggling cab-horse and the feet of the startled 
pair of bays. The crowd closed in as near as was safe, while 
the confusion and the shouts of the people and the carters 
increased every minute. 

The coachman of the private carriage threw the reins 
to the footman and sprang down to go to the horses' 
heads. 

' You have run over a Zouave ! ' some one shouted from 
the crowd. 

" Meno male ! Thank goodness it was not one of UB ! ' 
exclaimed another voice. 

'Where is he? Get him out, some of you!' cried the 
coachman as he seized the reins close to the bit. 

By this time a couple of stout gendarmes and two or 
three soldiers of the Antibes legion had made their way to 
the front and were dragging away the fallen cab-horse. A 
tall, thin, elderly gentleman, of a somewhat sour countenance, 
descended from the carriage and stooped over the injured 
soldier. 

' It is only a Zouave, Excellency,' said the coachman, 
with a sort of sigh of relief. 

The tall gentleman lifted Gouache's head a little so that 
the light from the carriage-lamp fell upon his face. He was 
quite insensible, and there was blood upon his pale forehead 
and white cheeks. One of the gendarmes came forward. 

' We will take care of him, Signore,' he said, touching his 
three-cornered hat. ' But I must beg to know your revered 
name,' he added, in the stock Italian phrase. ' Capira 
I am very sorry but they say your horses ' 

' Put him into my carriage,' answered the elderly gentle 
man shortly. ' I am the Principe Monte varchi.' 

'But, Excellency the Signorina ' protested the
