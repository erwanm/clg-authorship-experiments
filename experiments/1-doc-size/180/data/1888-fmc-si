' To-day,' answered the latter, without a smile, and em 
phasising the word as though it denned an exception, ' to 
day, I have nothing to do. Besides, it is early.' 

' We can play a hand and then we can dine at Cicco's.' 

' Being Friday in Advent, I had intended to fast,' replied 
the apothecary, who had not a penny in his pocket. ' But 
since you are so good as to invite me, I do not say no.' 

Meschini said nothing, for he understood the situation, 
which was by no means a novel one. His friend produced 
a pack of Italian cards, almost black with age. He gave 
Meschini the only chair, and seated himself upon a three- 
legged stool. 

It was a dismal scene. The shop was like many of its 
kind in the poorer quarters of old Rome. There was room 
for the counter and for three people to stand before it when 
the door was shut. The floor was covered with a broken 
pavement of dingy bricks. As the two men began to play 
a fine, drizzling rain wet the silent street outside, and the 
bricks within at once exhibited an unctuous moisture. The 
sky had become cloudy after the fine morning, and there was 
little light in the shop. Three of the walls were hidden by 
cases with glass doors, containing an assortment of majolica 
jars which would delight a modern amateur, but which looked 
dingy and mean in the poor shop. Here and there, between 
them, stood bottles large and small, some broken and dusty, 
others filled with liquids and bearing paper labels, brown 
with age, the ink inscriptions fading into the dirty surface 
that surrounded them. The only things in the place which

looked tolerably clean were the little brass scales and the 
white marble tablet for compounding solid medicines. 

The two men looked as though they belonged to the little 
room. Meschini's yellow complexion was as much in keep 
ing with the surroundings as the chemist's gray, colourless 
face. His bloodshot eyes wandered from the half-defaced 
cards to the objects in the shop, and he was uncertain in his 
play. His companion looked at him as though he were try 
ing to solve some intricate problem that gave him trouble. 
He himself was a man who, like the librarian, had begun 
life under favourable circumstances, had studied medicine 
and had practised it. But he had been unfortunate, and, 
though talented, did not possess the qualifications most neces 
sary for his profession. He had busied himself with chemistry 
and had invented a universal panacea which had failed, and 
in which he had sunk most of his small capital. Disgusted 
with his reverses he had gravitated slowly to his present 
position. Finding him careless and indifferent to their 
wants, his customers had dropped away, one by one, until he 
earned barely enough to keep body and soul together. Only 
the poorest class of people, emboldened by the mean aspect 
of his shop, came in to get a plaster, an ointment or a black 
draught, at the lowest possible prices. And yet, in certain 
branches, Tiberio Colaisso was a learned man. At all events 
he had proved himself able to do all that Meschini asked of 
him. He was keen, too in an indolent way, and a single 
glance had satisfied him that something very unusual had 
happened to the librarian. He watched him patiently, hoping 
to find out the truth without questions. At the same 
time, the hope of winning a few coppers made him keep an 
eye on the game. To his surprise he won easily, and he was 
further astonished when he saw that the miserly Meschini 
was not inclined to complain of his losses nor to accuse him 
of cheating. 

' You are not lucky to-day,' he remarked at last, when his 
winnings amounted to a couple of pauls a modern franc 
in all. 

Meschini looked at him uneasily and wiped his brow, 
leaning back in the rickety chair. His hands were trembling, 




' No,' he answered. ' I am not quite myself to-day. The 
fact is that a most dreadful tragedy occurred in our house 
last night, the mere thought of which gives me the fever. I 
am even obliged to take a little stimulant from time to 'time.' 

So saying, he drew the bottle from his pocket and applied 
it to his lips. He had hoped that it would not be necessary, 
but he was unable to do without it very long, his nerves 
being broken down by the quantity he had taken on the 
previous night. Colaisso looked on in silence, more puzzled 
than ever. The librarian seemed to be revived by the dose, 
and spoke more cheerfully after it. 

'A most terrible tragedy,' he said. 'The prince was 
murdered yesterday afternoon. I could not speak of it to 
you at once.' 

'Murdered?' exclaimed the apothecary in amazement. 
' And by whom ? ' 

i That is the mystery. He was found dead in his study. 
I will tell you all I know.' 

Meschini communicated the story to his friend in a disjointed fashion, interspersing his narrative with many com 
ments intended to give himself courage to proceed. He told 
the tale with evident reluctance, but he could not avoid the 
necessity. If Tiberio Colaisso read the account in the paper 
that evening, as he undoubtedly would, he would wonder 
why his companion had not been the first to relate the 
catastrophe ; and his wonder might turn into a suspicion. 
It would have been better not to come to the apothecary's, 
but since he found himself there he could not escape from 
informing him of what had happened. 

' It is very strange,' said the chemist, when he had heard 
all Meschini thought he detected a disagreeable look in his 
eyes. 

' It is, indeed,' he answered. ' I am made ill by it See 
how my hand trembles. I am cold and hot.' 

'You have been drinking too much,' said Colaisso suddenly, and with a certain brutality that startled his friend. 
' You are not sober. You must have taken a great deal last 
night. A libation to the dead, I suppose, in the manner of 
the ancients.' 



 

Meschini winced visibly and began to shuffle the cards, 
while he attempted to smile to hide his embarrassment. 

' I was not well yesterday at least I do not know what 
was the matter a headache, I think, nothing more. And 
then, this awful catastrophe horrible ! My nerves are un 
strung. I can scarcely speak.' 

' You need sleep first, and then a tonic,' said the apothe 
cary in a business-like tone. 

' I slept until late this morning. It did me no good. I 
am half dead myself. Yes, if I could sleep again it might 
do me good.' 

' Go home and go to bed. If I were in your place I 
would not drink any more of that liquor. It will only make 
you worse.' 

' Give me something to make me sleep. I will take it.' 

The apothecary looked long at him and seemed to be 
weighing something in his judgment. An evil thought 
crossed his mind. He was very poor. He knew well 
enough, in spite of Meschini's protestations, that he was not 
so poor as he pretended to be. If he were he could not have 
paid so regularly for the chemicals and for the experiments 
necessary to the preparation of his inks. More than once 
the operations had proved to be expensive, but the librarian 
had never complained, though he haggled for a baiocco over 
his dinner at Cicco's wine shop, and was generally angry 
when he lost a paul at cards. He had money somewhere. 
It was evident that he was in a highly nervous state. If he 
could be induced to take opium once or twice it might be 
come a habit To sell opium was very profitable, and Colaisso 
knew well enough the power of the vice and the proportions 
it would soon assume, especially if Meschini thought the 
medicine contained only some harmless drug. 

' Very well,' said the apothecary. 'I will make you a 
draught. But you must be sure that you are ready to sleep 
when you take it. It acts very quickly.' 

The draught which Meschini carried home with him was 
nothing but weak laudanum and water. It looked innocent
