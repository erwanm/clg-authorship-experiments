receipt. Beat hard, and set to rise over night. In the morning work in
the butter and soda, beat up for one whole minute until the mixture is
light throughout, and half-fill greased patty-pans with it. Set these
in a baking-pan, cover with a cloth, and let them stand in a warm place
fifteen minutes before putting them into a steady oven. They should be
done in from twelve to fifteen minutes if the oven is right. If they
brown too fast, cover them with paper.


Quick Muffins.

    One quart of sifted flour.

    One tablespoonful of salt.

    Three cups lukewarm milk.

    Two eggs.

    One tablespoonful of melted butter.

    Two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.

Sift flour, baking-powder and salt twice through the sieve, to make
sure these are well mixed together. Beat the eggs very light. (By
all means have a Dover Egg-Beater for this purpose. It whips eggs to
a lovely froth with less labor and in less time than any other yet
invented.)

Stir melted butter, eggs and milk together in a large bowl, and to this
add the flour, a cupful at a time, stirring very quickly and lightly
down toward the middle of the bowl. Beat hard up one minute at the
last, to break flour-lumps; half-fill greased patty-pans with the
batter, and then bake in a quick oven.

Turn out and eat while puffy and hot.


Sally Lunn. (The “Genuine Article.”)

    One quart of sifted flour.

    One cup of warm milk.

    One of warm water.

    Four large tablespoonfuls of yeast.

    Two tablespoonfuls of melted butter.

    Four eggs.

    One tablespoonful of salt sifted with the flour.

    Soda the size of a pea, dissolved in a teaspoonful of
      boiling water.

Beat the eggs steadily four minutes. Have ready in a bowl the warmed
milk, water, melted butter and soda. Into this stir the salted flour,
cupful by cupful, until all is in. Beat smooth from lumps and add the
yeast. The eggs should now be whipped three minutes with the “Dover,”
in a cool bowl. They will not froth in a hot or warm one. When light,
beat well into the batter, and then beat up hard for a full minute.
A wooden spoon is best for this purpose. Butter a tin cake-mould well
in every part, and put in the batter. If there is more than enough
to half-fill the mould have two prepared, that the contents may not
overflow in rising.

Set in a moderately warm place for six hours at least, and then bake in
the mould for three quarters of an hour if there is but one loaf, half
an hour if there are two.

The oven must be steady and not very hot at first. Turn the mould twice
in this time keeping the oven door open as short a time as possible.
When you think the loaf is done, thrust a clean straw down into the
thickest part.

If it comes up as clean as when it went in, take out the bread. Slip a
knife around the edge to loosen it, and turn out upside down on a warm
plate.

Cut in triangular slices at table, holding the knife upright to avoid
crushing and making it heavy.


Quick Biscuits.

    One quart of sifted flour.

    Two heaping tablespoonfuls of sweet, firm lard.

    Two cups of new milk (warm from the cow if you can get
      it.)

    Two tablespoonfuls of baking powder.

    One teaspoonful of salt.

Sift salt, flour, and baking-powder twice into a bowl or tray. With
a clean sharp chopping-knife work the lard into this, turning and
chopping until no lumps are left. Into a hollow in the middle pour
the milk, working the flour downward until you have a soft, wet mass,
using the chopper for this purpose. Flour your pastry-board and your
hands, make the dough into a ball, handling it as little as possible,
and lay on the board. Roll out with a floured rolling-pin into a sheet
half an inch in thickness, and with very few strokes. Cut into round
cakes, sift flour lightly over the bottom of a baking-pan, and set your
biscuits—just not touching one another—in even rows within it.

Bake about twelve minutes in a quick oven. The dough should have a
rough appearance before it is baked, like what is known as “pebbled
morocco.” Too much handling will make it sleek without and tough within.

You can make excellent quick biscuits by the above receipt, by
substituting Hecker’s Prepared Flour for the barreled family flour,
and omitting the baking-powder. You will, however, probably be obliged
to add a little more milk, as prepared flour “thickens up” rather more
than other brands.

OTHER BREAKFAST BREADS.


Griddle Cakes.

IN making these, let quickness be the first, second and third rules.
Beat briskly and thoroughly; mix just as you are ready to send the
cakes to the table (except when yeast is used), bake, turn, and serve
promptly. Have all your materials on the table, measured and ready to
your hand. The griddle must be perfectly clean and wiped off with a dry
cloth just before you lay it on the stove. Heat it gradually at one
side of the stove or range, and when it is warm grease with a bit of
fat salt pork stuck firmly on a fork. The fat should be hissing hot,
but not scorching, when the batter is poured on. Before putting the
cakes on to fry, slip the griddle to the hottest part of the stove.
Drop the batter in great, even spoonfuls, and be careful not to spill
or spatter it.

M. H. PHILLIPS AND CO., of Troy, N. Y., manufacture a griddle with
three shallow cups sunken in an iron plate which moves on a hinge. When
the cakes are done on the lower side the turn of a handle reverses
the plate upon a heated surface. This makes the cakes of equal size
and thickness and saves the trouble of watching, spatula in hand, to
turn each one. It greatly simplifies the process of baking cakes, and,
lessens the heating labor of attending to them.

Be sure that each cake is done before you turn it. A twice-turned
“griddle” is spoiled.


Sour-milk Cakes.

    One quart of “loppered,” or of buttermilk.

    Three cups of sifted flour.

    One cup of Indian meal.

    One “rounded” teaspoonful of soda free from lumps.

    One teaspoonful of salt.

    Two tablespoonfuls of molasses.

Sift flour, salt and meal into a bowl. In another mix the milk,
molasses and soda. Stir these last to a foam, and pour into the hollow
in the middle of the flour. Work down the flour into the liquid with
a wooden spoon until you have a batter, and beat hard with upward
strokes, two minutes. Bake at once. These are cheap, easy and good
cakes.


Hominy Cakes.

    Two cups of fine hominy boiled and cold. (Take the
      tough skin from the top before mixing in the batter.)
