of present luxury was once engaged in some inferior em- 
ployment." 

" But — allow me to offset this with one question — are 
your people of inferior employment always cultured and 
refined ? That they often do succeed to wealth I admit." 

"We will premise that they had all at first, as the 
mother of my little artist unquestionably did. Then 
comes bravely borne misfortune. Instead of sinking down 
and drifting about in search of the proper vantage ground, 
she took hold with a firm grasp of the work that came in 
her way, and succeeded." 

" And that was ? — " 

" Millinery ! " 

Mrs. Howarth's level brows rose the least trifle un- 
consciously. 

" She had the taste, the genius for that. She has made 
a home and is educating her children. But I am well 
aware that as a prima donna, a literary woman, or even an 
artist, it would have enhanced her social value. This is 
what I complain of, and it seems to be the weak point of 
the woman and the industrial questions." 

" How does Mrs. Thierry take it? " 

" Ah, you know that Mrs. Thierry is a born aristocrat, 
and that I pay my price for superior civilization" — he 
gave the merest elevation to his shoulders, and a light, 
humorous smile crossed his face. " Mrs. Marshall makes 
Mrs. Thierry look so transcendently lovely in new bon- 
nets that I go near to ruining myself in order to be the 
more deeply captivated. But to Mrs. Thierry the stain 
of labor on white hands is the unpardonable sin — as bad 
as Lady Macbeth's ; and the perfumes of the whole Orient 
cannot wash it out." 

" I wonder you and Marguerite never quarrel," she said, 
with a peculiar smile. 

" Does a man go out and hale his heliotrope bed that it 
has not borne him Jacqueminot roses ? I have a fondness 




for Aeliotrope, and it looks natural growing on its own 
slender green stem. Fancy it on the stalk of a sunflower." 

" So you want me to take up this pretty young artist 
and place her on a higher round than she can reach her- 
self?" 

" She can reach it alone, in the course of time. Still, life 
is too short to waste years in climbing the steep hill of suc- 
cess and resting between every step, as one must, if there 
are no other ways. I am heterodox enough to believe 
that one enjoys many things with the fresh zest of newly 
awakened appetite, but after hunger has ceased, and weari- 
ness taken its place, the keen relish has gone. There is a 
little scorn in the tone, that says, " You might have saved 
me yesterday; to-day I scarcely care for the saltation, — 
I have pitted myself against fate.' I would place her at 
once in art circles and let her fight her way — " 

Mrs. Howarth's face asked a question. 

" Because," he went on, " it would be too cruel to make 
her fight. Ten years from this it would not matter so 
much. And — I do not want her to wait. If I were not 
sure of her success I should hesitate ; or if I were a woman," 
and he laughed, " I could do it myself, but my pearl among 
girls must not have the bloom rubbed rudely away by a 
tint of scandal. See her, my dear friend. You and Stacy 
Van Cleve can surely manage it, and then, if you like her 
not, I shall say no more, but turn her over to fate and her 
own pure courage." 

At this point the conversation was interrupted, and 
Paul Thierry's duties did not allow him to return, though 
occasionally she caught his eye. She knew what her in- 
fluence would be for this young artist. She had taken 
up more than one just at the auspicious moment and floated 
them on to success, but her efforts were not indiscrimi- 
nately used. Indeed there were few who would have 
dared ask such a favor of Mrs. Howarth. 

One and another paused in her vicinity. She was a 





charming talker, fluent, choice, well read without any 
pedantry, and fresh without any strenuous efforts after 
the bizarre or unusual. Her husband came now and then 
and exchanged a few words with her, but he had other 
duties as well. 

" Leonard," she said, in one of the pauses, " I wish you 
would call the carriage and send me home. I am quite 
weary, and my head is aching a little ; but do not disturb 
yourself. I shall feel fresh and rested by the time you are 
at liberty," and she gave him an appreciative little smile. 

" I could go now — " 

" No ; if you begin to fancy me ill, I shall remain to dis- 
prove it." 

" As you choose," he answered, sending out to summon 
the carriage. 

The cool air quite revived her, for it had grown ex- 
tremely warm in the Club parlors. It was but a short 
distance home, and once there her maid assisted her to 
disrobe and don a white cashmere wrapper, soft and 
wraith-like in its delicacy. She seated herself at the 
lower end of the apartment, which overlooked a small 
garden instead of the street, and enjoyed not only the 
faint breeze but the quiet. There was no moon, but a 
throbbing glory of stars seemed crossing the faultless blue 
of the sky. 

Helen Howarth would have finished the trio begun 
with Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Van Cleve. She had not 
the delicate finished loveliness of the latter, nor the af- 
fluent health and buoyancy of the former ; yet there was 
a sufficient similarity of strong and tender characteristics 
to make them all friends. As Miss Lennox she had never 
been considered really beautiful ; but her fine and noble 
face, her suave and elegant breeding, her position and 
fortune, would have won her the front rank anywhere. 
It was a face harmonized more by expression, though the 
features were not wanting in regularity. They had been 



 

trained to the large, pure, noble view of the great truths 
of life. Evidently she was not a woman given to tem- 
porizing. Right was right, truth was truth ; her clear, keen 
eye penetrated subterfuges and weakness, and disdained 
paltry excuses of irresolution. Poverty would have made 
a hard woman of her, and in a small round she would 
have grown narrow ; but the larger sphere had been hers, 
with abundant means. Two or three fortunes had centered 
in her hands as the last of her branch of the family. But 
with this there had also come a kind of hereditary weak- 
ness; she seldom knew what it was to abound in the 
perfect health that seemed at times to mock her in other 
faces. 

She had gone one day to Mr. Howarth's office on an 
errand in which her sympathies had been strongly en- 
listed, though her whole soul had shrunk in abhorrence. 
A young brother of her seamstress, the idol of his 
widowed mother and sister, had been caught in the toils 
of one of those unscrupulous women who continually 
prey upon society from a vantage ground where they 
demand sympathy for misfortune. Wedded to a man 
much beneath her, who neglected her for haunts of intem- 
perance, she solaced herself with evil admiration, and 
drew from her lovers gifts that ministered to a passionate 
fondness for adornment quite beyond her reach in an hon- 
orable manner ; and they, poor, blind moths, fancied it 
was from their overwhelming sympathy and appreciation, 
rather than a cruel, soulless vanity on her part. She had 
cunningly suggested temptation to Walter Thoresby, and 
to gratify her insatiable desires he had taken an evil step, 
to learn that he was only one of many lured in the same
