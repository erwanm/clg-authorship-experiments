life run smoothly. It is not all romance and a tender 
voice or delightful honeyed words and smiles. And a 
man knows men better than women can.” 

Angelique made no further comment. Madame Henri- 
ade was still very kind to her and showed her many 
favors. 

“But I meet so few desirable people of your religion,” 
she said, “if you are going to let that stand in the way. 
They do not seem to be drawn into my circle, that is the 
trouble.” 

“Oh, do not think of me in that way, Madame. If I 
have your charming friendship, that is all I ask. And 
now I must devote myself to Sylvie.” 

“You are very sweet, ma fille, too sweet to be left to 
fade alone to old age.” 

“Old age is a long way off,” gayly. 

“Sylvie had better go to school and be* with other girls,” 
Barbe said one morning. “One knows not what to do 
with her. Only yesterday she was half captivated by 
the life of the Indian girls when that pretty one was in, 
trying to sell her goods. Living in a wigwam and work- 
ing beads into all sorts of things, and rambling through 
forests and canoeing — and I would not trust myself in a 
canoe for a pile of gold.” 

“I must take up Spanish again with her.” 

“And at home girls learned to sew and knit and make 
bread and puddings and preserves, and all sorts of things 
needed in housekeeping. Here the slaves do it for you. 
But among the Acadians there were little girls knitting, 
there were mothers sewing and tending babies. Slaves 
make one idle and helpless.” 

The betrothal was a very delightful and friendly 
occasion. The young couple did not hesitate to show a 
decided preference for each other afterward. The elder 





Monsieur Fleurien was rather small, a pleasant, white- 
haired man with round cheeks full of the bloom of the 
autumn of life rather than its winter. He was de- 
lighted with his son’s choice, and inclined to hurry the 
marriage forward that they might the sooner have her in 
their home. 

Long engagements were not much in favor. The mat- 
ter was well considered beforehand. Where and how the 
young people would live, and what their income would 
be, was all settled. If it was little, they made themselves 
content and dreamed of better times; if it was liberal, 
they might be gay enough between whiles when no babies 
claimed the first share of love and attention. For mother- 
hood was one of the great factors in that old life. 

Father Charlier and Father Moras of the convent were 
both present, and their blessing was almost as solemn as 
a marriage benediction. Everybody rejoiced, and there 
was much cordial good feeling and pleasantry. And 
though in the cafes and cabarets and at some of the 
officers’ houses there might be drunkenness and carous- 
ing, disputes ending in duels, one found little of it in 
private families. There was much merry-making with- 
out any excess. 

“Thou wilt soon have another daughter to husband,” 
said Pere Fleurien, with a smile, as he watched Zenobie. 
“She is of high mettle. Madame, I think my son has the 
choice, but I wish as good a husband for her as Mam’selle 
Claire will get. And we shall both give thanks many a 
time for your wise up-bringing.” 

“Yes. Zenobie will soon leave the convent now. She 
is, as you say, of high spirit, but a good girl, full of affec- 
tion and respect.” 

Zenobie was growng tall rapidly, and piquant rather 
than really handsome, but vivacious and capable of doing 




much execution with her eyes, which had not the demure 
sweetness of Claire’s, but would, no doubt, be as danger- 
ous. Sylvie looked pale and thin, but her golden hair 
was like a cloud about her. And though many at that 
age wore it in a high knot with a comb or a great cluster 
of bows, Sylvie’s flowed free in a mass of shining waves, 
the ends breaking into curls. Girls were very simply 
dressed in those days. A white gown, scant and ankle 
length, with perhaps a ruffle around the bottom ; a short 
waist, square in the neck, with a little lace edging, and 
perhaps a string of beads. Sylvie wore her pretty corals. 

Laure Gorgas was outside of all this. For that matter, 
she had no real standing, belonged to no particular class. 
At the convent there was small distinction made, but 
outside it was quite different, for a girl who knew nothing 
about her parents. 

So Sylvie was almost adored when she went down to 
Mere Milhet’s. Dolamine and Lucie were delighted with 
a bit of gossip, and Laure listened wide-eyed. 

“Zenobie will sit on the topmost round of the ladder 
now, and step on the fingers of those who venture to 
climb,” Laure declared, sharply. “It is a very fine mar- 
riage, everybody says. And Zenobie will soon leave the 
convent and be a young lady having lovers. See what it 
is to have a father with money !” 

“I have no father and no money,” said the little one, 
soberly. 

“Then you’ll have hard work getting a husband, 
Mam’selle, unless you grow very handsome.” 

Sylvie smiled with inward comfort. She had a husband 
already. When she was twelve she might announce it. 
And now Claire would not want him. 

“What are you smiling about?” queried Laure. 




''Angelique could have had a nice husband and she had 
no money,” replied the child, with quick wit. 

'‘Mam’selle Angelique is handsome.” Then, soften- 
ing a little, ‘Tt is very good of you, Sylvie, to come and 
tell us all about it. And the old gra’mere has taken a 
fancy to you, I hear ; but she is so old I should not think 
she could tell one girl from another. Did they bring her 
down ?” 

*‘Oh, no. A procession went up. The priests first, 
then M. and Madame Lavalette and the young people. 
All the guests did not go. It was very pretty. I shall 
go to see her married.” 

‘‘Ah, Mam’selle Sylvie, if you could but find your way 
to the true Church. I pray for you.” 

Pointe Coupee was considerably more than a hundred 
miles above the old city, but, though given mostly to large 
plantations, was the centre for trade with the posts of 
Natchez, with Baton Rouge, Natchitoches, and also the 
Southern ports as well as the city. One of the most 
prominent planters of the province was M. Poydras, who 
had taken such a warm interest in the young Princes. 
His was a rather romantic story. Roger Norton had told 
it over to them one afternoon, sitting in the old garden. 
While in the French navy he had been taken prisoner 
and sent to England, where he spent his time wisely in 
acquiring the language. He managed to escape and 
made his way to Louisiana just in time to see it become 
a Spanish possession. The river filled him with dreams 
of commerce, and he travelled from plantation to planta- 
tion, supplying families with needful wares until he had 
accumulated sufficient to purchase this point and enlarge 
his business. Gentle in disposition, honest to the most 
scrupulous degree, he presently had the trade from 




St. Louis to Florida, Now he had built a cotton gin in 
two places, and his plantation had been added to as far as 
False River. Other planters had settled there, Fleurien 
being among the earlier ones.
