was only her archness, and he knew what to make of that 
now ; she was dressed in yellow and looked very plump and 
gay. He wondered at the unerring instinct by which she 
had discovered his exposed quarter. The outer room was 
completely empty; she had come in at the further door 
and found the field free for her operations. He offered to 
find her a place where she could see and hear Miss Tarrant, 
to get her a chair to stand on, even, if she wished to look 
over the heads of the gentlemen in the doorway; a proposal 
which she greeted with the inquiry '  Do you suppose I 
came here for the sake of that chatterbox ? haven't I told 
you what I think of her?' 

'Well, you certainly did not come here for my sake,' 
said Ransom, anticipating this insinuation ; ' for you 
couldn't possibly have known I was coming.' 

'I guessed it a presentiment told me!' Mrs. Luna 
declared; and she looked up at him with searching, 
accusing eyes. 'I know what you have come for,' she 
cried in a moment. ' You never mentioned to me that you 
knew Mrs. Burrage !' 

' I don't I never had heard of her till she asked me.' 
' Then why in the world did she ask you ?' 
Ransom had spoken a trifle rashly ; it came over him, 
quickly, that there were reasons why he had better not have 
said that. But almost as quickly he covered up his 
mistake. ' I suppose your sister was so good as to ask for 
a card for me.' 

' My sister ? My grandmother ! I know how Olive 



 

loves you. Mr. Ransom, you are very deep.' She had 
drawn him well into the room, out of earshot of the group 
in the doorway, and he felt that if she should be able to 
compass her wish she would organise a little entertainment 
for herself, in the outer drawing-room, in opposition to Miss 
Tarrant's address. 'Please come and sit down here a 
moment; we shall be quite undisturbed. I have some- 
thing very particular to say to you/ She led the way to 
the little sofa in the corner, where he had been talking with 
Olive a few minutes before, and he accompanied her, with 
extreme reluctance, grudging the moments that he should 
be obliged to give to her. He had quite forgotten that he 
once had a vision of spending his life in her society, and 
he looked at his watch as he made the observation : 

' I haven't the least idea of losing any of the sport in 
there, you know.' 

He felt, the next instant, that he oughtn't to have said 
that either; but he was irritated, disconcerted, and he 
couldn't help it. It was in the nature of a gallant Missis- 
sippian to do everything a lady asked him, and he had never, 
remarkable as it may appear, been in the position of finding 
such a request so incompatible with his own desires as now. 
It was a new predicament, for Mrs. Luna evidently meant 
to keep him if she could. She looked round the room, 
more and more pleased at their having it to themselves, and 
for the moment said nothing more about the singularity of 
his being there. On the contrary, she became freshly 
jocular, remarked that now they had got hold of him they 
wouldn't easily let him go, they would make him entertain 
them, induce him to give a lecture on the ' Lights and 
Shadows of Southern Life,'- or the ' Social Peculiarities of 
Mississippi ' before the Wednesday Club. 

' And what in the world is the Wednesday Club ? I sup- 
pose it's what those ladies were talking about,' Ransom said. 

' I  don't know your ladies, but the Wednesday Club is 
this thing. I don't mean you and me here together, but 
all those deluded beings in the other room. It is New 
York trying to be like Boston. It is the culture, the good 
form, of the metropolis. You might not think it, but it is. 
It's the ' quiet set ' ; they are quiet enough ; you might 



 

hear a pin drop, in there. Is some one going to offer up a 
prayer? How happy Olive must be, to be taken so seri- 
ously ! They form an association for meeting at each 
other's houses, every week, and having some performance, 
or some paper read, or some subject explained. The more 
dreary it is and the more fearful the subject, the more they 
think it is what it ought to be. They have an idea this is 
the way to make New York society intellectual. There's a 
sumptuary law isn't that what you call it? about suppers, 
and they restrict themselves to a kind of Spartan broth. 
When it's made by their French cooks it isn't bad. Mrs. 
Burrage is one of the principal members one of the 
founders, I believe ; and when her turn has come round, 
formerly it comes only once in the winter for each I am 
told she has usually had very good music. But that is 
thought rather a base evasion, a begging of the question ; 
the vulgar set can easily keep up with them on music. So 
Mrs. Burrage conceived the extraordinary idea' and it was 
wonderful to hear how Mrs. Luna pronounced that adjective 
' of sending on to Boston for that girl. It was her son, 
of course, who put it into her head ; he has been at Cam- 
bridge for some years that's where Verena lived, you know 
and he was as thick with her as you please out there. 
Now that he is no longer there it suits him very well to 
have her here. She is coming on a visit to his mother 
when Olive goes. I asked them to stay with me, but Olive 
declined, majestically ; she said they wished to be in some 
place where they would be free to receive 'sympathising 
friends.' So they are staying at some extraordinary kind of 
New Jerusalem boarding-house, in Tenth Street; Olive 
thinks it's her duty to go to such places. I was greatly 
surprised that she should let Verena be drawn into such a 
worldly crowd as this ; but she told me they had made up 
their minds not to let any occasion slip, that they could sow 
the seed of truth in drawing-rooms as well as in workshops, 
and that if a single person was brought round to their ideas 
they should have been justified in coming on. That's what 
they are doing in there sowing the seed; but you shall 
not be the one that's brought round, I shall take care of 
that. Have you seen my delightful sister yet ? The way 



she does arrange herself when she wants to protest against 
frills ! She looks as if she thought it pretty barren ground 
round here, now she has come to see it. I don't think she 
thinks you can be saved in a French dress, anyhow. I must 
say I call it a very base evasion of Mrs. Burrage's, producing 
Verena Tarrant ; it's worse than the meretricious music. 
Why didn't she honestly send for a ballerina from Niblo's 
if she wanted a young woman capering about on a plat- 
form ? They don't care a fig about poor Olive's ideas ; it's 
only because Verena has strange hair, and shiny eyes, and 
gets herself up like a prestidigitator's assistant. I have 
never understood how Olive can reconcile herself to 
Verena's really low style of dress. I suppose it's only 
because her clothes are so fearfully made. You look as if 
you didn't believe me but I assure you that the cut is 
revolutionary ; and that's a salve to Olive's conscience/ 

Ransom was surprised to hear that he looked as if he 
didn't believe her, for he had found himself, after his first 
uneasiness, listening with considerable interest to her 
account of the circumstances under which Miss Tarrant was 
visiting New York. After a moment, as the result of some 
private reflection, he propounded this question : ' Is the 
son of the lady of the house a handsome young man, very 
polite, in a white vest?' 

' I don't know the colour of his vest but he has a 
kind of fawning manner. Verena judges from that that he 
is in love with her.' 

' Perhaps he is,' said Ransom. '  You say it was his 
idea to get her to come oa' 

' Oh, he likes to flirt ; that is highly probable.' 

'  Perhaps she has brought him round.' 

'Not to where she wants, I think. The property is 
very large ; he will have it all one of these days.' 

' Do you mean she wishes to impose on him the yoke 
of matrimony ?' Ransom asked, with Southern languor. 

' I believe she thinks matrimony an exploded super- 
stition ; but there is here and there a case in which it is 
still the best thing ; when the gentleman's name happens 
to be Burrage and the young lady's Tarrant I don't 
admire ' Burrage ' so much myself. But I think she would
