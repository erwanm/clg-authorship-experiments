Mrs. Howard took a trip around Madison one morning, and held sundry
mysterious conferences with some of her neighbors, returning home quite
well pleased.

"I am so glad I thought of it!" she said to her husband; and he
answered, "So am I, my dear."

One afternoon early in December she went over to Mrs. Kenneth's. Dot
had been clearing up under Hal's instructions, and they looked neat
as a pin. After she found that her visitor intended to remain, Granny
put on a fresh calico dress and a clean cap; and they had a nice
old-fashioned time talking, which Hal enjoyed exceedingly.

Mrs. Howard had brought a basket full of various luxuries,--some nice
cold tongue, and part of a turkey, besides jellies and cake. Quite a
little feast, indeed.

Hal begged them to have tea in the best room, where he lay; and he
enjoyed it almost as much as if he could have sat up to the table. Kit
and Charlie were delighted with the feast.

Then they settled every thing again, and Granny stirred the fire. The
wind whistled without, but within it was bright and cheerful. Hal felt
very happy indeed. It seemed as if God's strong arms were about him,
helping him to bear the weariness, as he had been strengthened to bear
pain.

Presently there was a tramping up the path, and a confusion of voices.

"Some one is coming;" and Hal raised himself. "I am almost sorry--we
were having such a nice, quiet time."

A knock at the door, which Granny opened. Kit, in the glowing
chimney-corner, rubbed his eyes; and it would have been hard to tell
which was the sleepiest, he or the old gray cat.

"O-o-h!" exclaimed Charlie; and then she darted to Hal. "A whole crowd
of 'em!"

A crowd, sure enough. It was something of a mystery to know how they
were going to get in that small place. There was Dr. and Mrs. Meade,
Mr. Howard, Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and the boys, all the Terrys,--indeed,
half Madison, Hal thought.

Mrs. Howard laughed a little at Hal's puzzled face.

"Oh!--I guess"--

Granny in the other room was quite overcome. Parcels and bags and
boxes, shaking of hands, and clattering of tongues.

"It isn't exactly Christmas, Hal," began Mr. Morris; "but Santa Claus
does sometimes lose his reckoning. So we thought we'd all drop in."

"And give me a surprise-party," said Hal.

"Exactly. Why, you look quite bright, my boy!"

Hal was bright enough then, with cheeks like roses, and lustrous eyes.

Dr. Meade sat him up in the bed. One and another came to shake hands,
and say a pleasant word; and in a few moments the whole group were
laughing and talking. There was skating already over on the pond, the
boys told him; they were going to have a Christmas exhibition; Jim
Terry had received a letter from Joe; and all the small gossip that
sounds so pleasant when one is shut within doors.

Then Mrs. Howard brought out the bedspread. None of the boys laughed at
Hal, you may be sure; and the older people thought it quite wonderful.
Mrs. Morris declared that she'd really like to have it.

"It is for sale," said Hal with a little flush.

"Let's take shares!" exclaimed Sam. "Now's your chance, mother: how
much will you give?"

"A right good plan," returned Mrs. Meade.

After a little discussion they adopted it. There were twenty-six people
who subscribed a dollar; and then the slips of paper were arranged for
drawing. The younger portion were considerably excited; and Hal's face
was in a glow of interest.

So they began. One after another took his or her chance; and, when it
was through, they all opened their slips of paper, looking eagerly at
each other.

Clara Terry blushed scarlet; and Sam's quick eyes caught the unusual
brilliancy. For the cream of the affair was, that Clara expected to be
married in a few weeks.

Dr. Meade guessed also, and then they had a good laugh. Hal was
delighted.

"It went to the right one," said Mr. Morris. "So much towards
housekeeping, Clara."

"I shall always think of Joe as well as you," she said in a soft
whisper to Hal, holding the thin fingers a moment.

After that they had a pleasant time singing. Hal was very fond of vocal
music. It seemed to him about the happiest night of his life. Then the
crowd began to disperse.

"I have thought of something new, Hal," said Dr. Meade. "I sent to New
York this morning for a small galvanic battery, to try if electricity
will not help you. We shall have you around yet: do not be discouraged."

"Everybody is so kind"--and Hal's voice quivered. "This has been a
lovely surprise party."

After they were gone Charlie began to count up the spoils; and every
exclamation grew longer and louder. There was a large ham, a fine
turkey, tea and coffee and butter, flour, rice, farina, cake and
biscuit, a bag of apples, and some cans of fruit.

"We shall live like kings," said Granny, with a little sound in her
voice that might have been a sob or a laugh. "And only this morning I
was a wondering how we should get along."

"And twenty-six dollars. Why, it is almost as good as being a minister,
and having a donation-party."

"God doesn't forget us, you see," said Hal with great thankfulness.

He finished the spread a few days afterward, and sent it to Miss Clara;
and then Mrs. Meade brought him the materials to make her one.

The fracture had united; but there seemed such a terrible weakness
of the muscles in Hal's back, that Dr. Meade had become rather
apprehensive. But, after using electricity a few weeks, there was an
improvement. And one day Hal balanced himself upon two crutches.

"That's red hot!" ejaculated Charlie.

"O Charlie! worthy follower of Joe, what will you do when you get to be
a young lady?"

"Oh, dear! I wish I didn't have to be one;" and Charlie began to cry.
"I'll wear a big stone on top of my head."

"I am afraid it is too late. You are as tall as Granny now."

Hal gained slowly. All this time he was thinking what he should do?
for he had a presentiment that he might never be very strong again.
No more working around on farms; and, though there were some sedentary
trades in cities, he would meet with no chance to attain to them. So he
must have the green-house.

By spring he was able to go about pretty well. But he looked white as a
ghost, quite unlike the round rosy Hal of other days.

"Kit," said he, "you'll have to be my right-hand man this summer. Maybe
by another Christmas we might have the violin."

"O Hal! I'd work from morning till night," and the eager eyes were
luminous.

"Well, we'll see."

Charlie was seized with a helpful fit also. After the garden was
ploughed, they all planted and hoed and weeded; and, as it was an early
season, they had some quite forward vegetables.

One day Hal went over to Salem, and invested a few dollars in
tuberoses, besides purchasing some choice flower-seeds. Then he stopped
into a small place where he had noticed cut-flowers, and began to
inquire whether they ever bought any.

"All I can get," said the man. "Flowers are coming to be the rage.
People think they can't have weddings or funerals without them."

"But you want white ones mostly?"

"White ones for funerals and brides. There are other occasions, though,
when colored ones are worth twice as much, and as much needed."

"You raise some?" said Hal.
