"No, madame, it is true. He wears a smug mask here; he has deceived
you all."

She stood there, breathing rapidly, her head high.

"John Buckhurst will answer for himself," she said, steadily.

"When, madame?"

For answer she stepped across the hall and laid one hand against the
blank stone wall. Then, reaching upward, she drew from between the
ponderous blocks little strips of steel, colored like mortar, dropping
them to the stone floor, where they rang out. When she had flung away
the last one, she stepped back and set her frail shoulder to the wall;
instantly a mass of stone swung silently on an unseen pivot, a yellow
light streamed out, and there was a tiny chamber, illuminated by a
lamp, and a man just rising from his chair.

PRISONERS


Instantly I recognized in him the insolent priest who had confronted
me on my way to La Trappe that morning. I knew him, although now he
was wearing neither robe nor shovel-hat, nor those square shoes too
large to buckle closely over his flat insteps.

And he knew me.

He appeared admirably cool and composed, glancing at the Countess for
an instant with an interrogative expression; then he acknowledged my
presence by bowing almost humorously.

"This is Monsieur Scarlett, of the Imperial Military Police," said
the Countess, in a clear voice, ending with that slightly rising
inflection which demands an answer.

"Mr. Buckhurst," I said, "I am an Inspector of Military Police, and
I cannot begin to tell you what a pleasure this meeting is to me."

"I have no doubt of that, monsieur," said Buckhurst, in his smooth,
almost caressing tones. "It, however, inconveniences me a great deal
to cross the frontier to-day, even in your company, otherwise I should
have surrendered with my confrères."

"But there is no question of your crossing the frontier, Mr.
Buckhurst," I said.

His colorless eyes sought mine, then dropped. They were almost stone
white in the lamp-light--white as his delicately chiselled face and
hands.

"Are we not to be exiled?" he asked.

"You are not," I said.

"Am I not under arrest?"

I stepped forward and placed him formally under arrest, touching him
slightly on the shoulder. He did not move a muscle, yet, beneath the
thin cloth of his coat I could divine a frame of iron.

"Your creed is one of non-resistance to violence," I said--"is it
not?"

"Yes," he replied. I saw that gray ring around the pale pupil of his
eyes contracting, little by little.

"You have not asked me why I arrest you," I suggested, "and,
monsieur, I must ask you to step back from that table--quick!--don't
move!--not one finger!"

For a second he looked into the barrel of my pistol with concentrated
composure, then glanced at the table-drawer which he had jerked open.
A revolver lay shining among the litter of glass tubes and papers in
the drawer.

The Countess, too, saw the revolver and turned an astonished face to
my prisoner.

"Who brought you here?" asked Buckhurst, quietly of me.

"I did," said the Countess, her voice almost breaking. "Tell this
man and his government that you are ready to face every charge against
your honor! There is a dreadful mistake; they--they think you are--"

"A thief," I interposed, with a smile. "The government only asks you
to prove that you are not."

Slowly Buckhurst turned his eyes on the Countess; the faintest glimmer
of white teeth showed for an instant between the gray lines that were
his lips.

"So you brought this man here?" he said. "Oh, I am glad to know
it."

"Then you cannot be that same John Buckhurst who stands in the
tribune of the Château Rouge and promises all Paris to his chosen
people," I remarked, smiling.

"No," he said, slowly, "I cannot be that man, nor can I--"

"Stop! Stand back from that table!" I cried.

"I beg your pardon," he said, coolly.

"Madame," said I, without taking my eyes from him, "in a community
dedicated to peace, a revolver is an anachronism. So I think--if you
move I will shoot you, Mr. Buckhurst!--so I think I had better take
it, table-drawer and all--"

"Stop!" said Buckhurst.

"Oh no, I can't stop now," said I, cheerfully, "and if you attempt
to upset that lamp you will make a sad mistake. Now walk to the door!
Turn your back! Go slowly!--halt!"

With the table-drawer under one arm and my pistol-hand swinging, I
followed Buckhurst out into the hall.

Daylight dazzled me; it must have affected Buckhurst, too, for he
reached out to the stone balustrade and guided himself down the steps,
five paces in front of me.

Under the trees on the lawn, beside the driveway, I saw Dr. Delmont
standing, big, bushy head bent thoughtfully, hands clasped behind his
back.

Near him, Tavernier and Bazard were lifting a few boxes into a
farm-wagon. The carriage from Trois-Feuilles was also there, a stumpy
Alsatian peasant on the box. But there were yet no signs of the escort
of gendarmes which had been promised me.

As Buckhurst appeared, walking all alone ahead of me, Dr. Delmont
looked up with a bitter laugh. "So they found you, too? Well,
Buckhurst, this is too bad. They might have given you one more day on
your experiments."

"What experiments?" I asked, glancing at the bottles and retorts in
the table-drawer.

"Nitrogen for exhausted soil," said the Countess, quietly.

I set the table-drawer on the grass, rested my pistol on my hip, and
looked around at my prisoners, who now were looking intently at me.

"Gentlemen," said I, "let me warn you not to claim comradeship with
Mr. Buckhurst. And I will show you one reason why."

I picked up from the table-drawer a little stick about five inches
long and held it up.

"What is that, doctor? You don't know? Oh, you think it might be some
sample of fertilizer containing concentrated nitrogen? You are
mistaken, it is not nitrogen, but nitro-glycerine."

Buckhurst's face changed slightly.

"Is it not, Mr. Buckhurst?" I asked.

He was silent.

"Would you permit me to throw this bit of stuff at your feet?" And I
made a gesture.

The superb nerve of the man was something to remember. He did not
move, but over his face there crept a dreadful pallor, which even the
others noticed, and they shrank away from him, shocked and amazed.

"Here, gentlemen," I continued, "is a box with a German
label--'Oberlohe, Hanover.' The silicious earth with which
nitro-glycerine is mixed to make dynamite comes from Oberlohe, in
Hanover."

I laid my pistol on the table, struck a match, and deliberately
lighted my stick of dynamite. It burned quietly with a brilliant
