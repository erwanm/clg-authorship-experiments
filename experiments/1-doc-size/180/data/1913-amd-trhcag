Will they do to fill up, Mr. Evans? ” inquired 
his host humorously. “ Can you find places for 
them?” 

‘‘ I shall be only too glad to have them.” 

‘‘ Is it Sunday-school ? ” asked Prim. Are 
there many classes ? ” • 

Well, not many in some of the classes. How 
was the school at Denby ? Did you like it ? ” 

“ I liked it about Christmas time very much on 
account of the carols.” 

“ Oh, then you sing? ” 

“ I can sing with the others. Pm apt to get off 
the track when I go it alone. Goldie and Chan 
are the songsters of this family.” 




“ So you like the carols ? ” The question 
seemed for all of them. 

‘‘ I brought them home. We don’t know all the 
tunes,” said Chan. “ Maybe you could play them 
for us. But I suppose you had some fine ones. 
We have only a squeaky melodeon in the Sunday- 
school room. I’d rather sing without.” 

We have a very nice parlor organ, and in 
the church an excellent one. I’m glad you like 
music.” 

I want some of them to learn to play. I am 
very fond of singing as well. Is there any teacher 
about? ” asked Mr. Mann. 

‘‘Yes; we have a lady organist at church, and 
she gives music lessons; is, indeed, a fine hand to 
train children. Her sister keeps the only school 
in the place, and she assists when she can.” 

“ And a day school is another thing I must con- 
sider. Where do the larger children go ? ” 

“ There is a fine public school just in the edge 
of Ridgewood. Some day I suppose we shall all 
be the town of Ridgewood. You see, a sort of 
syndicate planned this suburb, and there would not 
be enough children for a school. Miss Raynor is 
well liked.” 

“ The other is — how far? ” 

“ I think most of the children ride in and walk 




home. Nearly a mile — we passed it this 
morning.” 

Mr. Mann considered. The four older ones 
could go,” he said tentatively. 

“ I want to,” began Tip. Why couldn’t we 
go in the sleigh? ” 

There mightn’t always be snow,” remarked 
Mr. Mann sagely. 

‘‘ Then Dan could take the wagon.” 

I think you would like the school here better,” 
suggested Mr. Evans. “ The Raynors have a 
pretty old house, with quite large grounds. For- 
tunately, Elm Street did not disturb them. The 
north and south streets are named from trees, the 
cross streets from Presidents, as you may have ob- 
served,” to Mr. Mann. 

“ The street just below us is Maple,” said Prim- 
rose. Then it must be the second street.” 

Yes. It is several blocks below, near Monroe 
Street.” 

Do they begin with Washington?” asked 
Chan. 

Yes. That is one side of the park, and the 
chapel is on it.” 

We must go and spy out the land,” said Mari- 
gold, and know where the streets are.” 




There’s a beautiful big house on Maple Street, 
but it looks shut up.” 

Yes, it is,” returned Mr. Evans. The Field- 
ings come out in May and go back to the city in 
October, and then to Florida. Some of the other 
lovely houses are shut up in the winter. It takes 
some time for a place like this to be interesting 
all the year round.” 

The gardens were beautiful, I noticed last 
summer,” said Mr. Mann. And it was such a 
great and delightful change to me after a life in 
the crowded part of the city. I’m afraid I didn’t 
show much neighborliness. I spent most of my 
leisure driving about. I am but an indifferent card 
player, so I would be no attraction to that kind of 
society. And then I found Chan,” smiling. 

The boy and the man exchanged tender glances. 

And you found all of us,” interposed Tip. 

And Chan and I came over here and stayed all 
night, and I was sure there was a big bear in the 
room, and I cried. I wanted mother.” 

And what was it? ” asked Mr. Evans. 

Chan explained, with sundry additions from 
Tip. 

Oh, I don’t wonder you were a little fright- 
ened. I’ve known grown folks to be in the same 
plight,” laughing a little. 




And our snow man looks like a big ghost in 
the moonlight,” said Marigold. “ Every night 
Dan drenches him with water, and in the morning 
he looks as if he was covered with thousands of 
jewels.” 

‘‘ I must go out and see him.” And then they 
talked about snow forts and mimic battles. For 
two years, as a growing boy, Mr. Evans had lived 
in the country. Presently, at a signal from Mrs. 
Alden, Rilla rose from her place, and, with a 
basket, gathered up the knives and forks and 
spoons with no clatter, while Mrs. Alden removed 
the heavier dishes, and the dessert came on. 

Rilla was very ambitious to have things nice and 
pretty. She questioned Mrs. Alden, and in re- 
turn tried to train the younger ones. 

“ You see,” she would say in her lecture, ‘‘ this 
is such a pretty house and all the things are so 
nice, that we mustn’t act like rough country chil- 
dren and make father ashamed of us.” 

Afterward they all retired to the parlor, and 
Chan begged Mr. Evans to play. Oh, what a de- 
light it was ! 

“ I am more used to the organ,” he said. ‘‘We 
have a very fine parlor organ in the house, but no 
piano. Don’t some of you sing?” 




They stared a moment at each other in bashful 
silence, then Prim answered with a laugh :
