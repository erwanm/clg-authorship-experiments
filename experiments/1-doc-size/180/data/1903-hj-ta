But, as we were saying just now, what did I come out for 
but to save him ? " 

" Yes — to remove him." 

" To save him by removal ; to win him over to himself 
thinking it best he shall take up business — thinking he 
must immediately do, therefore, what is necessary to that 
end." 

" Well," said little Bilham after a moment, " you have 
won him over. He does think it best. He has within a 
day or two again said to me as much." 

"And that," Strether asked, " is why you consider that 
he cares less than she ? " 

" Cares less for her than she for him ? Yes, that's one 
of the reasons. But other things too have given me the 
impression. A man, don't you think ? " little Bilham 
presently pursued, "can't, in such conditions, care so much 
as a woman. It takes different conditions to make him, 
and then perhaps he cares more. Chad," he wound up, 
" has his possible future before him." 

" Are you speaking of his business future ? " 








" No — on the contrary ; of the other, the future of what 
you so justly call their situation. M. de Vionnet may live 
forever." 

" So that they can't marry ? " 

The young man just hesitated. "Not being able to 
marry is all they've with any confidence to look forward 
to. A woman— a particular woman — may stand that 
strain ; but can a man ? " 

Strether's answer was as prompt as if he had already, 
for himself, worked it out.  ' Not without a very high 
ideal of conduct. But that's just what we're attributing 
to Chad. And how, for that matter," he mused, " does his 
going to America diminish the particular strain ? Wouldn't 
it seem rather to add to it ? " 

" Out of sight, out of mind ! " his companion laughed. 
Then more bravely : " Wouldn't distance lessen the 
torment   " But before Strether could reply, " The thing 
is, you see, Chad ought to marry ! " he exclaimed. 

Strether, for a little, appeared to think of it. "If you 
talk of torments, you don't diminish mine ! " he then broke 
out. The next moment he was on his feet with a question. 
" He ought to marry whom ? " 

Little Bilham rose more slowly. " Well, someone he 
can— some thoroughly nice girl." 

Strether's eyes, as they stood together, turned again to 
Jeanne. " Do you mean her ? " 

His friend made a sudden strange face. "After being in 
love with her mother ? No." 

" But isn't it exactly your idea that he isn't in love with 
her mother ? " 

His friend once more had a pause. " Well, he isn't, at 
any rate, with Jeanne." 

" I dare say not. How can he be with any other 
woman ? " 

"Oh, that I admit. But being in love isn't, you know, 
here" — little Bilham spoke in friendly reminder — " thought 
necessary, in strictness, for marriage." 

" And what torment — to call a torment— can there ever 
possibly be with a woman like that?" As if from the 
interest of his own question, Strether had gone on with- 
out hearing. " Is it for her to have turned a man out so 





wonderfully, too, only for somebody else ? " He appeared 
to make a point of this, and little Bilham looked at him 
now. " When it's for each other that people give things 
up they don't miss them." Then he threw off as with an 
extravagance of which he was conscious : " Let them face 
the future together ! " 

" You mean that, after all, he shouldn't go back ? " 

" I mean that if he gives her up ! " 

" Yes ? " 

"Well, he ought to be ashamed of himself." But Strether 
spoke with a sound that might have passed for a laugh. 



PART SEVENTH 



XVI 

It was not the first time he had sat solitary in the 
 great dim church — still less was it the first of his giving 
himself up, so far as conditions permitted, to its beneficent 
action on his nerves. He had been to Notre Dame with 
VVaymarsh, he had been there with Miss Gostrey, he had 
been there with Chad Newsome, and had found the place, 
even in company, such a refuge from the obsession of his 
problem that, with renewed pressure from that source, he 
had not unnaturally recurred to a remedy that seemed so, 
for the moment, to meet the case. He was conscious 
enough that it was only for the moment, but good moments 
— if he could call them good — still had their value for a man 
who, by this time, struck himself as living almost disgrace- 
fully from hand to mouth. Having so well learnt the way, 
he had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by 
himself — had quite stolen off, taking an unnoticed chance 
and feeling no need of speaking of the adventure when 
restored to his friends. 

His great friend, for that matter, was still absent, as well 
as remarkably silent ; even at the end of three weeks Miss 
Gostrey had not come back. She wrote to him from 
Mentone, admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequent — perhaps, in fact, for the time, odiously faithless ; 
but asking for patience, for a deferred sentence, throwing 
herself, in short, on his generosity. For her too, she could 
assure him, life was complicated — more complicated than 
he could have guessed ; she had moreover made certain of 
him — certain of not wholly missing him on her return — 
before her disappearance. If furthermore she didn't 
burden him with letters it was frankly because of her 
sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on. 
He himself, at the end of a fortnight, had written twice, 
to show how his generosity could be trusted ; but he 


reminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome's 
epistolary manner at the times when Mrs. Newsome kept 
off delicate ground. He sank his problem, he talked of 
Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and the set 
over the river, with whom he had again had tea, and he 
was easy, for convenience, about Chad and Mme. de 
Vionnet and Jeanne. He admitted that he continued to 
see them, he was, decidedly, so confirmed a haunter of 
Chad's premises, and that young man's practical intimacy 
with them was so undeniably great ; but he had his 
reason for not attempting to render for Miss Gostrey's 
benefit the impression of these last days. That would be 
to tell her too much about himself — it being at present just 
from himself that he was trying to escape. 

This small struggle sprang not a little, in its way, from 
the same impulse that had now carried him across to Notre 
Dame ; the impulse to let things be, to give them time to 
justify themselves, or at least to pass. He was aware of 
having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be, 
for the hour, in certain other places ; a sense of safety, of 
simplification, which, each time he yielded to it, he amused 
himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice. 
The great church had no altar for his worship, no direct 
voice for his soul ; but it was none the less soothing even 
to sanctity ; for he could feel while there what he couldn't 
elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday 
he had earned. He was tired, but he wasn't plain — that
