peace. Ruth " 

" She does not know." 

" Let us hurry home. Of course I must start at once. 
Every moment seems an age to me." 

As they reached the gate they saw the phaeton winding 
up the drive. 

" I am afraid we have grown cowards," General Macken- 
zie said, with a sad, absent smile. ' How will she bear it ? " 

It was a high tribute paid to her motherhood, real only 
in the diviner part, love. 

She saw at once that something had occurred. After 
her tender greeting, they went up to the chamber of con- 
fidences, Aunt Ruth's room. 

" What has happened? Oh, you do know, Uncle Rob- 
ert? " And Kathie studied him with painful interest. 

" Bruce has been wounded in an Indian skirmish, very 
badly, they fear." 

Kathie turned and went quietly up-stairs. Some time 
after it seemed an hour, but it was not more than ten 
minutes she heard Aunt Ruth's voice and went to her, 
to them, standing tenderly in the midst of their sorrow, yet 
oh, sad irony of fate, quite outside, sheltered in another 
love ! 

They were going West immediately. The one comfort 
in his cup was the exquisite wifely sympathy. 

By noon they were gone. How sudden and strange it 
seemed ! Kathie read the papers and then wandered about 
in a lonely mood, until she bethought herself that she owed 
Rob a letter. 





In the evening's mail came one for Uncle Robert, that 
caused him anxious study. 

"I wish I could see you," the young man wrote. "I feel 
sometimes as if I should go out of my senses in this blank, 
('vary loneliness. I have given up fighting, everything! 
Let fate take its course. For the child's sake it is best to 
keep the wretched secret. Have I shut myself out of 
home, all love, all sympathy, all trust? When I think of 
mother and her bitter disappointment in me, harder to bear 
than any that have gone before, I feel as if I ought to stay 
quite away from you all. What shall I do ? I am so tired 
of thinking. Decide for me. Whatever way, I shall be 
quite content. I am not sure but that I can bear the bur- 
den better when I know exactly what it is to be." 

It was not the yielding Robert Conover had wished for 
him. Perhaps that was asking too much. It was not pen- 
itence in the greater sense, only sorrow and weariness. He 
must go to him at once, for hours like this were subtly 
alive to temptation. It was not full salvation, but it 
is a long way from the city of destruction to the heavenly 
city. 

It would be better to tell his mother now, and let her have 
the intervening time to get over the shock, yet that would 
commit Robert to a course without his own volition. He 
wanted him to choose for the sake of after years. It was a 
sad puzzle, and he could not sleep, thinking it over, so 
when morning dawned he rose unrefreshed. 

The papers came with fuller details of the massacre, a 
cruel, cowardly, planned affair, in which several brave lives 
had been sacrificed. Lieutenant Mackenzie was reported 
dangerously wounded. 

" I am going out to Chicago," Uncle Robert announced. 
" I think our boy is homesick, and may bring him back." 
" Let me go with you," cried Fred eagerly. 
" But we cannot leave the house alone." 
" Why not take us all, then ? " inquired Kathie. " Some- 
how we should be nearer Aunt Ruth." 





" I don't know that I could just now," pausing as if to 
consider. 

In old times Mrs. Alston would have been quick to take 
alarm. Now, she seemed to turn the matter over in her 
mind leisurely. 

" I couldn't go on so short a notice," she said. 

"And I shall travel rapidly. We may go somewhere 
else, Fred, before the summer is over. Cities are not 
always at their best in heat and dust." 

Kathie alone appeared to have a misgiving. 

"I hope nothing will happen to Rob," she said. "It 
seems to me the world has turned gray with trouble." 



CHAPTER XIX. 

CERTAINLY these few weeks had wrought a great change 
in Robert Alston. The bright complexion had grown pal- 
lid, the eyes were heavy with purple shadows underneath, 
and the eager, joyous vigor changed to a kind of stolid 
apathy. 

" O my boy ! " Mr. Conover exclaimed in genuine dis- 
tress, " have you been ill?" 

" No." But the grasp of the hand was lifeless. "That 
is, I don't sleep much and have wretched headaches. I 
haven't given up business, though I have been offered a 
month's vacation." 

The tone indicated an impending change, even if he had 
no distinct plan in view. 

" You have never been out of my mind for a moment," 
said the elder in a tone of warmest sympathy. " I have 
wanted to come, but I did not know whether I should help 
or hinder. Robert, you must know by this time that noth- 
ing can change our love for you. It may be wounded by 
coldness, it may stand silently aside when thrust out of 
confidence, but it is always waiting for you. We can give, 
but we cannot force you to take. That is your own part, 
your own work." 

He gave his head a little impatient toss and frowned. 
" Shall we go to a hotel?" he asked. " I have changed 
my boarding place and have only a little box of a room." 

" Yes, that will be better. I am afraid you have not 
been taking very good care of yourself." 

" What does it matter," wearily, ' when everything has 
gone out of life ? " 




"Robert, you are making a fatal mistake," began his 
uncle in a decisive tone. " Life is just opening before you. 
You are too young to give up in this hopeless way, to 
wreck yourself for one sad misstep. You made such a 
good, brave fight at first ; you kept in the right path so 
steadfastly that I can hardly understand how you have let 
yourself drop down to this level. It is unlike you." 

" I had not come to the dregs then," bitterly. 

" I do not think you have now, or, if you have, remem- 
ber there is, or should be, a wholesome tonic in the bitter. 
If you had loved her I could see how horribly dark and 
dreary all the years to come might look, unless you turned 
to God's light and strength for grace. But here we are. 
Let us take a room, and while I am freshening up a bit 
you may order supper." 

Robert Conover felt that human wisdom and strength 
were vain, and he cried to the Lord for that diviner grace 
to guide this young soul aright, to save him from immi- 
nent wreck and perishing. For he must come out of it 
rightly, or all the after life would be weak and flawed, ren- 
dered dangerously susceptible to other temptations. 

The young man ordered the supper and glanced over
