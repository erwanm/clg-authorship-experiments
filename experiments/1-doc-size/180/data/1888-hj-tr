" You draw me out and then you jibe at me," 
Mr. Flack remarked. 

" I didn 't draw you out. Couldn 't you see me 
just straining to get away ? " 

" Don 't you sympathise with rny ideas ? " 

" Of course I do, Mr. Flack ; I think they're 
splendid," said Francie, who did not in the least 
understand them. 

" Well, then, why won 't you work with me ? 
Your affection, your brightness, your faith would 
be everything to me." 

" I'm very sorry but I can 't I can t," the girl 
declared. 

" You could if you would, quick enough." 

" Well, then, I won 't ! " And as soon as 
these words were spoken, as if to mitigate some 
thing of their asperity, Francie paused a 
moment and said : " You must remember that 
T never said I would nor anything like it. I 



 



thought you just wanted me to speak to my 
father." 

" Of course I supposed you would do that." 

" I mean about your paper." 

" About my paper ? " 

"So as he could give you the money to do 
what you want." 

"Lord, you're too sweet!" George Flack ex 
claimed, staring. "Do you suppose I would ever 
touch a cent of your father s money ? " a speech 
not so hypocritical as it may sound, inasmuch as 
the young man, who had his own refinements, had 
never been guilty, and proposed to himself never 
to be, of the plainness of twitching the purse- 
strings of his potential father-in-law with his own 
hand. He had talked to Mr. Dosson by the hour 
about the interviewing business, but he had never 
dreamed that this amiable man would give him 
money as an interesting straggler. The only 
character in which he could expect it would be 
that of Francie s husband, and then it would come 
to Francie not to him. This reasoning did not 
diminish his desire to assume such a character, and 
his love of his profession and his appreciation of 
the girl at his side ached together in his breast 
with the same disappointment. She saw that her 
words had touched him like a lash; they made 
him blush red for a moment. This caused her 
own colour to rise she could scarcely have said 
w hy and she hurried along again. He kept close 







to her ; he argued with her ; he besought her to 
think it over, assured her he was the best fellow 
in the world. To this she replied that if he didn 't 
leave her alone she would cry and how would he 
like that, to bring her back in such a state to the 
others ? He said, " Damn the others ! " but that 
did not help his case, and at last he broke out : 
" Will you just tell me this, then is it because 
you've  promised Miss Delia ? " Francie answered 
that she had not promised Miss Delia anything, 
and her companion went on : "Of course I know 
what she has got in her head : she wants to get 
you into the high set the grand monde, as they 
call it here ; but I didn 't suppose you'd let her fix 
your life for you. You were very different before 
he turned up. " 

" She never fixed anything for me. I haven 't 
got any life and I don 't want to have," said 
Francie. " And I don 't know who you are talking 
about, either ! " 

" The man without a country. He 'll pass you 
in that s what your sister wants." 

" You oughtn 't to abuse him, because it was you 
that presented him," the girl rejoined. 

" I never presented him ! I'd like to kick him." 

" We should never have seen him if it hadn 't 
been for you." 

" That s a fact, but it doesn 't make me love 
him any the better. He s the poorest kind 
there is." 







"I don 't care anything about his kind." 

" That s a pity, if you're going to marry him. 
How could I know that when I took you up 
there ? " 

" Good-bye, Mr. Flack," said Francie, trying to 
gain ground from him. 

This attempt was of course vain, and after a 
moment he resumed : " Will you keep me as a 
friend ? " 

" Why, Mr. Flack, of course I will ! " cried 
Francie. 

"All right," he replied; and they presently 
rejoined their companions.

GASTON PROBERT made his plan, imparting it to 
no one but his friend Waterlow, whose help in 
deed he needed to carry it out. These confidences 
cost him something, for the clever young painter 
found his predicament amusing and made no 
scruple of showing it. Probert was too much in 
love, however, to be discountenanced by sarcasm. 
This fact is the more noteworthy as he knew 
that Waterlow scoffed at him for a purpose 
had a theory that that kind of treatment would 
be salutary. The French taste was in Waterlow s 
" manner," but it had not yet coloured his view 
of the relations of a young man of spirit with 
parents and pastors. He was Gallic to the tip 
of his finest brush, but the humour of his early 
American education could not fail to obtrude itself 
in discussion with a friend in whose life the 
principle of authority played so large a part. He 
accused Probert of being afraid of his sisters, 
which was a crude way (and he knew it) of allud - 





ing to the rigidity of the conception of the family 
among people who had adopted and had even to 
Waterlow s sense, as the phrase is, improved upon 
the usages of France. That did injustice (and 
this the artist also knew), to the delicate nature 
of the bond which united the different members 
of the house of Probert, who were each for all 
and all for each. Family feeling among them was 
not a tyranny but a religion, and in regard to 
Mesdames de Brecourt, de Cliche and de Douves 
what Gaston was most afraid of was seeming to 
them not to love them. None the less Charles
