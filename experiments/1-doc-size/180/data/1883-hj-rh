She was afraid of an "accident," though unless Miss 



 

Striker (who indeed was a little of a romp) should push 
Roderick into the lake, it was hard to see what accident 
could occur. Mrs. Hudson was as neat and crisp and 
uncrumpled at the end of the festival as at the beginning. 
Mr. Whitefoot, who but a twelvemonth later became a 
convert to Episcopacy and was already cultivating a cer 
tain conversational sonority, devoted himself to Cecilia. 
He had a little book in his pocket, out of which he read 
to her at intervals, lying stretched at her feet ; and it 
was a lasting joke with Cecilia afterwards that she would 
never tell what Mr. Whitefoot 's little book had been. 
Rowland had placed himself near Miss Garland while 
the feasting went forward on the grass. She wore a so- 
called gipsy hat a little straw hat, tied down over her 
ears, so as to cast her eyes into shadow, by a ribbon 
passing outside of it. When the company dispersed 
after lunch, he proposed to her to take a stroll in the 
wood. She hesitated a moment, and looked towards 
Mrs. Hudson as if for permission to leave her. But 
Mrs. Hudson was listening to Mr. Striker, who sat 
gossiping to her with relaxed consistency, his waistcoat 
unbuttoned and his hat on his nose. 

"You can give your cousin your society at any time," 
said Rowland. "But me perhaps you will never see 
again. " 

"Why, then, should we wish to be friends, if nothing 
is to come of it?" she asked with homely logic. But 
by this time she had consented, and they were treading 
the fallen pine-needles. 

" Oh, one must take all one can get," said Rowland. 
"If we can be friends for half an hour it 's so much 
gained." 

" Do you expect never to come back to Northampton 
again?" 

" Never is a good deal to say. But I go to Europe 
for a long stay." 

Do you prefer it so much to your own country ? " 



 

" I will not say that. But I have the misfortune to 
be a rather idle man, and in Europe the burden of idle 
ness is less heavy than here." 

She was silent for a few minutes; then at last, "In 
that, then, we are better than Europe, " she said. To a 
certain point Rowland agreed with her, but he demurred, 
to make her say more. 

"Wouldn't it be better," she asked, "to work to get 
reconciled to America than to go to Europe to get recon 
ciled to idleness?" 

" Doubtless, but you know work is hard to find." 

" I come from a little place where every one has 
plenty," said Mary Garland. "We all work; every 
one I know works. And really," she added presently, 
" I look at you with curiosity ; you are the first unoccu 
pied man I ever saw." 

" Don't look at me too hard," said Rowland, smiling. 
" I shall sink into the earth. What is the name of your 
little place?" 

"West Nazareth," said Mary Garland with her usual 
directness. "It is not so very little, though it 's smaller 
than Northampton." 

" I wonder whether I could find any work at West 
Nazareth," Rowland said. 

"You would not like it," Miss Garland declared re 
flectively. "Though there are far finer woods there 
than this. We have miles and miles of woods." 

"I might chop down trees," said Rowland. "That 
is, if you allow it." - 

"Allow it? Why, where should we get our fire- wood?" 
Then noticing that he had spoken jestingly she glanced 
at him askance, though with no visible diminution of 
her gravity. Don't you know how to do anything ? 
Have you no profession ?" 

Rowland shook his head. Absolutely none. " 

" What do you do all day ?" 

" Nothing worth relating. That 's why I am going to 



 

Europe. There at least if I do nothing I shall see a 
great deal ; and if I am not a producer I shall at any 
rate be an observer." 

"Can't we observe everywhere?" 

"Certainly; and I really think that in that way I 
make the most of my opportunities. Though I confess," 
he continued, that I often remember there are things to 
be seen here to which I probably have not done justice. 
I should like, for instance, to see West Nazareth. " 

She looked round at him, open-eyed ; not apparently 
that she exactly supposed he was jesting, for the expres 
sion of such a desire was not necessarily facetious ; but 
as if he must have spoken with an ulterior motive. In 
fact, he had spoken from the simplest of motives. The 
girl beside him pleased him immensely, and suspecting 
that her charm was essentially her own and not reflected 
from social circumstance, he wished to give himself the 
satisfaction of contrasting her with the meagre influences 
of her education. Miss Garland 's second movement was 
to take him at his word. " Since you are free to do as 
you please, why don't you go there?" 

" I am not free to do as I please now. I have offered 
your cousin to bear him company to Europe, he has 
accepted with enthusiasm, and I can't back out." 

" Are you going to Europe simply for his sake ?" 

Rowland hesitated for a moment. I think I may 
almost say so." 

Mary Garland walked along in silence. "Do you 
mean to do a great deal for him?" she asked at last. 

" What I can. But my power of helping him is very 
small beside his power of helping himself." 

For a moment she was silent again. " You are very 
generous," she said, almost solemnly. 

" No, I am simply very shrewd. Roderick will repay 
me. It 's a speculation. At first, I think," he added 
shortly afterwards, "you would not have paid me that 
little compliment. You didn't believe in me." 



 

She made no attempt to deny it. "I didn't see why 
you should wish to make Roderick discontented. I 
thought you were rather frivolous." 

" You did me injustice. I don't think I am that." 

" It was because you are unlike other men those at 
least whom I have seen." 

"In what way?" 

" Why, as you describe yourself. You have no duties, 
no profession, no home. You live for your pleasure." 

"That 's all very true. And yet I maintain I am not 
frivolous." 

" I hope not," said Maiy Garland, simply. They had 
reached a point where the wood -path forked and put
