freshness and brightness of life. She touches 
everything so daintily, she hits off a character in 
a sentence, she gives the pith of a dialogue with 
out tediousness, she mimics without vulgarity ; 
her narration sparkles, but it doesn't sting. The 
picture of her day is full of vivacity, and it gives 
new value and freshness to common things. If 



 

we could only have on the stage such actresses 
as we have in the drawing-room ! 

THE FIRE-TENDER. We want something more 
of this grace, sprightliness, and harmless play of 
the finer life of society in the newspaper. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. I wonder Mandeville 
doesn't marry, and become a permanent sub 
scriber to his embodied idea of a newspaper. 

THE YOUNG LADY. Perhaps he does not rel 
ish the idea of being unable to stop his subscrip 
tion. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. Parson, won't you please 
punch that fire, and give us more blaze ? we are 
getting into the darkness of socialism. 



III. 

HERBERT returned to us in March. The Young 
Lady was spending the winter with us, and March, 
in spite of the calendar, turned out to be a winter 
month. It usually is in New England, and April 
too, for that matter. And I cannot say it is 
unfortunate for us. There are so many topics to 
be turned over and settled at our fireside that a 



 

winter of ordinary length would make little 
impression on the list. The fireside is, after all, 
a sort of private court of chancery, where noth 
ing ever does come to a final decision. The 
chief effect of talk on any subject is to strengthen 
one's own opinions, and, in fact, one never knows 
exactly what he does believe until he is warmed 
into conviction by the heat of attack and defence. 
A man left to himself drifts about like a boat on 
a calm lake ; it is only when the wind blows that 
the boat goes anywhere. 

Herbert said he had been dipping into the 
recent novels written by women, here and there, 
with a view to noting the effect upon literature 
of this sudden and rather overwhelming acces 
sion to it. There was a good deal of talk about 
it evening after evening, off and on, and I can 
only undertake to set down fragments of it. 

HERBERT. I should say that the distinguish 
ing feature of the literature of this day is the 
prominence women have in its production. They 
figure in most of the magazines, though very 
rarely in the scholarly and critical reviews, and 
in thousands of newspapers ; to them we are 



 

indebted for the oceans of Sunday-school books, 
and they write the majority of the novels, the 
serial stories, and they mainly pour out the 
watery flood of tales in the weekly papers. 
Whether this is to result in more good than evil 
it is impossible yet to say, and perhaps it would 
be unjust to say, until this generation has worked 
off its froth, and women settle down to artistic, 
conscientious labor in literature. 

THE MISTRESS. You don't mean to say that 
George Eliot, and Mrs. Gaskell, and George 
Sand, and Mrs. Browning, before her marriage 
and severe attack of spiritism, are less true to art 
than contemporary men novelists and poets. 

HERBRET. You name some exceptions that 
show the bright side of the picture, not only for 
the present, but for the future. Perhaps genius has 
no sex ; but ordinary talent has. I refer to the 
great body of novels, which you would know by 
internal evidence were written by women. They 
are of two sorts : the domestic story, entirely un- 
idealized, and as flavorless as water-gruel ; and the 
spiced novel, generally immoral in tendency, in 
which the social problems are handled, unhappy 



 

marriages, affinity and passional attraction, bigamy, 
and the violation of the seventh commandment. 
These subjects are treated in the rawest manner, 
without any settled ethics, with little discrimina 
tion of eternal right and wrong, and with very 
little sense of responsibility for what is set forth. 
Many of these novels are merely the blind out 
bursts of a nature impatient of restraint and the 
conventionalities of society, and are as chaotic as 
the untrained minds that produce them. 

MANDEVILLE. Don't you think these novels 
fairly represent a social condition of unrest and 
upheaval ? 

HERBERT. Very likely ; and they help to cre 
ate and spread abroad the discontent they de 
scribe. Stories of bigamy (sometimes disguised 
by divorce), of unhappy marriages, where the 
injured wife, through an entire volume, is on the 
brink of falling into the arms of a sneaking lover, 
until death kindly removes the obstacle, and the 
two souls, who were born for each other, but got 
separated in the cradle, melt and mingle into one 
in the last chapter, are not healthful reading for 
maids or mothers. 



 

THE MISTRESS. Or men. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. The most disagreeable 
object to me in modern literature is the man 
the women novelists have introduced as the lead 
ing character; the women who come in contact 
with him seem to be fascinated by his disdainful 
mien, his giant strength, and his brutal manner. 
He is broad across the shoulders, heavily moulded, 
yet as lithe as a cat ; has an ugly scar across his 
right cheek ; has been in the four quarters of the 
globe ; knows seventeen languages ; had a harem 
in Turkey and a Fayaway in the Marquesas ; can 
be as polished as Bayard in the drawing-room, 
but is as gloomy as Conrad in the library ; has a 
terrible eye and a withering glance, but can be 
instantly subdued by a woman's hand, if it is 
not his wife's ; and through all his morose and 
vicious career has carried a heart as purt as 
a violet. 

THE MISTRESS. Don't you think the Count 
of Monte Cristo is the elder brother of Ro 
chester ? 

THE FIRE-TENDER. One is a mere hero of 
romance ; the other is meant for a real man. 



 

MANDEVILLE. I don't see that the men novel- 
writers are better than the women. 

HERBERT. That 's not the question ; but what 
are women who write so large a proportion of the 
current stories bringing into literature ? Aside 
from the question of morals, and the absolutely 
demoralizing manner of treating social questions,
