Tom if countries always apologised when they had 
done wrong, and he says : 

' Yes ; the little ones does.' 

We was sailing around examining the Pyramids, 
you know, and now ^e soared up and roosted on 
the flat top of the biggest one, and found it was 
just like what the man said in the Sunday school. 
It was like four pairs of stairs that starts broad at 
the bottom and slants up and comes together in a 
point at the top, only these stair-steps couldn't be 
dumb the way you climb other stairs ; no, for each 
step was as high as your chin, and you have to be 
boosted up from behind. The two other Pyramids 
warn't far away, and the people moving about on 
the sand between looked like bugs crawling, we was 
so high above them. 

Tom he couldn't hold himself, he was so worked 
up with gladness and astonishment to be in such a 
celebrated place, and he just dripped history from 
every pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn't 
scarcely believe he was standing on the very iden- 
tical spot the prince fltw from on the bionze horse. 
It was in the ' Arabian Night ' times, he said. Some- 
body give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in 
its shoulder, and he cOuld git on him and fly 
through the air like a bird, and go all over the world, 
and steer it by turning the peg, and fly high or low 
and land wherever he wanted to. 


When he got done telling it there was one of 
them uncomfortable silences that comes, you know, 
when a person has been telling a whopper and you 
feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some 
way to change the subject and let him down easy, 
but git stuck and don't see no way, and before you 
can pull your mind together and do something, that 
silence has got in and spread itself and done the 
business. I was embarrassed, Jim he was embar- 
rassed, and neither of us couldn't say a word. Well, 
Tom he glowered at me a minute, and says : 

' Come, out with it. What do you think ? ' 

I says : 

' Tom Sawyer, you don't believe that yourself.' 

' What's the reason I don't ? What's to hender 
me?' 

' There's one thing to hender you : it couldn't 
happen, that's all.' 

' What's the reason it couldn't happen ? ' 

' You tell me the reason it could happen.' 

' This balloon is a good enough reason it could 
happen, I should reckon.' 

' Why is it ? ' 

' Why is it ? I never saw such an idiot. Ain't 
this balloon and the bronze horse the same thing 
under different names ? ' 

' No, they're not. One is a balloon and the 
other's a horse. It's very different. Next you'll 
be saying a house and a cow is the same thing.' 

' By Jackson, Huck's got him ag'in ! Dey ain't 
no wigglin' outer dat ! ' 

' Shut your head, Jim ; you don't know what 
you're talking about. And Huck don't. Look here, 
Huck, I'll make it plain to you, so you can under- 
stand. You see, it ain't the mere form that's got 
anything to do with their being similar or unsimilar, 
it's the principle involved ; and the principle is the 
same in both. Don't you see now ? ' 

I turned it over in my mind, and says : 

' Tom, it ain't no use. Principles is all very 
well, but they don't git around that one big fact, 
that the thing that a balloon can do ain't no sort of 
proof of what a horse can do.' 

' Shucks, Huck ! you don't get the idea at all. 
Now, look here a minute — it's perfectly plain. Don't 
we fly through the air ? ' 

' Yes.' 

 Very well. Don't we fly high or fly low, just 
as we please ? ' 

'Yes.' 

' Don't we steer whichever way we want to ? ' 

' Yes.' 

' And don't we land when and where we please '? ' 

' Yes.' 

' How do we move the balloon and steer it ? ' 
' By touching the buttons.' 

' Now I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. 
In the other case the moving and steering was 
done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the 
prince turned a peg. There ain't an atom of dif- 
ference, you see. I knowed I could git it through 
your head if I stuck to it long enough.' 

He felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me 
and Jim was silent, so he broke off surprised, and 
says: 

' Looky here, Huck Finn, don't you see it yet ? ' 

I says : 

' Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some 
questions.' 

' Go ahead,' he says, and I see Jim chirk up to 
listen. 

' As I understand it, the whole thing is in the 
buttons and the peg— the rest ain't of no conse- 
quence. A button is one shape, a peg is another 
shape, but that ain't any matter.' 

' No, that ain't any matter as long as they've 
both got the same power.' 

' All right, then. What is the power that's in 
a candle and in a match ? ' 
' It's the fire.' 

' It's the same in both, then ? ' 
' Yes, just the same in both.' 
' All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter 
shop with a match, what will happen to that car- 
penter shop ? ' 

' She'll burn up.' 

' And suppose I set fire to this Pyramid with a 
candle — will she burn up ? ' 
' Of course she won't.' 

 All right. Now, the fire's the same, both times. 
Why does the shop burn, and the Pyramid don't ? ' 

 Because the Pyramid can't burn.' 
 

' Aha ! and a horse can't fly ! ' 

' My Ian', ef Huck ain't got him ag'in ! Huck's 
landed him high en dry dis time, I tell you ! Hit's 
de smartes' trap I ever see a body walk inter — en 
efl ' 

But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling 
and couldn't go on, and Tom was that mad to see 
how neat I had floored him, and turned his own 
argument ag'in him and knocked him all to rags 
and flinders with it, that all he could manage to say 
was that whenever he heard me and Jim try to 
argue it made him ashamed of the human race. I 
never said nothing — I was feeling pretty well satis-
