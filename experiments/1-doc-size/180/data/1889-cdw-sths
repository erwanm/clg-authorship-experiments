1886. I shall speak of its extension in 1887, which was intrusted to Mr.
D. C. Shepard, a veteran engineer and railway builder of St. Paul, and
his firm, Messrs. Shepard, Winston & Co. Credit should be given by name
to the men who conducted this Napoleonic enterprise; for it required
not only the advance of millions of money, but the foresight, energy,
vigilance, and capacity that insure success in a distant military
campaign.

It needs to be noted that the continuation of the St. Paul, Minneapolis,
and Manitoba road from Great Falls to Helena, 98 miles, is called the
Montana Central. The work to be accomplished in 1887 was to grade 500
miles of railroad to reach Great Falls, to put in the bridging and
mechanical structures (by hauling all material brought up by rail ahead
of the track by teams, so as not to delay the progress of the track)
on 530 miles of continuous railway, and to lay and put in good running
condition 643 miles of rails continuously and from one end only.

In the winter of 1886-87 the road was completed to a point five miles
west of Minot, and work was done beyond which if consolidated would
amount to about fifty miles of completed grading, and the mechanical
structures were done for twenty miles west from Minot. On the Montana
Central the grading and mechanical structures were made from Helena as
a base, and completed before the track reached Great Falls. St. Paul,
Minneapolis, and Duluth were the primary bases of operations, and
generally speaking all materials, labor, fuel, and supplies originated
at these three points; Minot was the secondary base, and here in
the winter of 1886-87 large depots of supplies and materials for
construction were formed.

Track-laying began April 2,1887, but was greatly retarded by snow and
ice in the completed cuts, and by the grading, which was heavy. The
cuts were frozen more or less up to May 15th. The forwarding of grading
forces to Minot began April 6th, but it was a labor of considerable
magnitude to outfit them at Minot and get them forward to the work;
so that it was as late as May 10th before the entire force was under
employment.

The average force on the grading was 3300 teams and about 8000 men.
Upon the track-laving, surfacing, piling, and timber-work there were
225 teams and about 650 men. The heaviest work was encountered on the
eastern end, so that the track was close upon the grading up to the 10th
of June. Some of the cuttings and embankments were heavy. After the 10th
of June progress upon the grading was very rapid. From the mouth of Milk
River to Great Falls (a distance of 200 miles) grading was done at an
average rate of seven miles a day. Those who saw this army of men
and teams stretching over the prairie and casting up this continental
highway think they beheld one of the most striking achievements of
civilization.

I may mention that the track is all cast up (even where the grading is
easy) to such a height as to relieve it of drifting snow; and to give
some idea of the character of the work, it is noted that in preparing it
there were moved 9,700,000 cubic yards of earth, 15,000 cubic yards of
loose rock, and 17,500 cubic yards of solid rock, and that there were
hauled ahead of the track and put in the work to such distance as would
not obstruct the track-laying (in some instances 30 miles), 9,000,000
feet (board measure) of timber and 390,000 lineal feet of piling.

On the 5th of August the grading of the entire line to Great Falls was
either finished or properly manned for its completion the first day
of September, and on the 10th of August it became necessary to remove
outfits to the east as they completed their work, and about 2500 teams
and their quota of men were withdrawn between the 10th and 20th of
August, and placed upon work elsewhere.

The record of track laid is as follows: April 2d to 30th, 30 miles;
May, 82 miles; June, 79.8 miles; July, 100.8 miles; August, 115.4 miles;
September, 102.4 miles; up to October 15th to Great Falls, 34.0 miles—a
total to Great Falls of 545 miles. October 10th being Sunday, no track
was laid. The track started from Great Falls Monday, October 17th, and
reached Helena on Friday, November 18th, a distance of 98 miles, making
a grand total of 043 miles, and an average rate for every working-day
of three and one-quarter miles. It will thus be seen that laying a good
road was a much more expeditious method of reaching the Great Falls of
the Missouri than that adopted by Lewis and Clarke.

Some of the details of this construction and tracklaying will interest
railroad men. On the 16th of July 7 miles and 1040 feet of track were
laid, and on the 8th of August 8 miles and 60 feet were laid, in each
instance by daylight, and by the regular gang of track-layers, without
any increase of their numbers whatever. The entire work was done by
handling the iron on low iron cars, and depositing it on the track from
the car at the front end. The method pursued was the same as when one
mile of track is laid per day in the ordinary manner. The force of
track-layers was maintained at the proper number for the ordinary daily
work, and was never increased to obtain any special result. The result
on the 11th of August was probably decreased by a quarter to a half mile
by the breaking of an axle of an iron car while going to the front with
its load at about 4 p.m. From six to eight iron cars were employed in
doing this day’s work. The number ordinarily used was four to five.

Sidings were graded at intervals of seven to eight miles, and spur
tracks, laid on the natural surface, put in at convenient points,
sixteen miles apart, for storage of materials and supplies at or near
the front. As the work went on, the spur tracks in the rear were taken
up. The construction train contained box cars two and three stories
high, in which workmen were boarded and lodged. Supplies, as a rule,
were taken by wagon-trains from the spur tracks near the front to their
destination, an average distance of one hundred miles and an extreme one
of two hundred miles. Steamboats were employed to a limited extent on
the Missouri River in supplying such remote points as Fort Benton
and the Coal Banks, but not more than fifteen per cent, of the
transportation was done by steamers. A single item illustrating the
magnitude of the supply transportation is that there were shipped to
Minot and forwarded and consumed on the work 590,000 bushels of oats.

It is believed that the work of grading 500 miles of railroad in five
months, and the transportation into the country of everything consumed,
grass and water excepted, and of every rail, tie, bit of timber, pile,
tool, machine, man, or team employed, and laying 643 miles of track
in seven and a half months, from one end, far exceeds in magnitude
and rapidity of execution any similar undertaking in this or any other
country. It reflects also the greatest credit on the managers of the
railway transportation (it is not invidious to mention the names of Mr.
A. Manvel, general manager, and Mr. J. M. Egan, general superintendent,
upon whom the working details devolved) when it is stated that the
delays for material or supplies on the entire work did not retard it
in the aggregate one hour. And every hour counted in this masterly
campaign.

The Western people apparently think no more of throwing down a railroad,
if they want to go anywhere, than a conservative Easterner does of
taking an unaccustomed walk across country; and the railway constructors
and managers are a little amused at the Eastern slowness and want of
facility in construction and management. One hears that the East is
antiquated, and does not know anything about railroad building. Shovels,
carts, and wheelbarrows are of a past age; the big wheel-scraper does
the business. It is a common remark that a contractor accustomed to
Eastern work is not desired on a Western job.

On Friday afternoon, November 18th, the news was flashed that the last
rail was laid, and at 6 p.m. a special train was on the way from St.
Paul with a double complement of engineers and train-men. For the first
500 miles there was more or less delay in avoiding the long and frequent
freight trains, but after that not much except the necessary stops for
cleaning the engine. Great Falls, about 1100 miles, was reached Sunday
noon, in thirty-six hours, an average of over thirty miles an hour. A
part of the time the speed was as much as fifty miles an hour. The track
was solid, evenly graded, heavily tied, well aligned, and the cars ran
over it with no more swing and bounce than on an old road. The only
exception to this is the piece from Great Falls to Helena, which had not
been surfaced all the way. It is excellent railway construction, and it
is necessary to emphasize this when we consider the rapidity with which
it was built.

The company has built this road without land grant or subsidy of any
kind. The Montana extension, from Minot, Dakota, to Great Falls, runs
mostly through Indian and military reservations, permission to pass
through being given by special Act of Congress, and the company buying
200 feet road-way. Little of it, therefore, is open to settlement.

These reservations, naming them in order westward, are as follows: The
Fort Berthold Indian reservation, Dakota, the eastern boundary of which
is twenty-seven miles west of Minot, has an area of 4550 square miles
(about as large as Connecticut), or 2,912,000 acres. The Fort Buford
military reservation, lying in Dakota and Montana, has an area of 900
square miles, or 576,000 acres. The Blackfeet Indian reserve has an area
of 34,000 square miles (the State of New York has 46,000), or 21,760,000
acres. The Fort Assiniboin military reserve has an area of 869.82 square
miles, or 556,684 acres.

It is a liberal estimate that there are 6000 Indians on the Blackfeet
and Fort Berth old reservations. As nearly as I could ascertain, there
are not over 3500 Indians (some of those I saw were Créés on a long
visit from Canada) on the Blackfeet reservation of about 22,000,000
acres. Some judges put the number as low as 2500 to all this territory,
and estimate that there was about one Indian to ten square miles, or one
Indian family to fifty square miles. We rode through 300 miles of this
territory along the Milk River, nearly every acre of it good soil, with
thick, abundant grass, splendid wheat land.

I have no space to take up the Indian problem. But the present condition
of affairs is neither fair to white settlers nor just or humane to the
Indians. These big reservations are of no use to them, nor they to
the reservations. The buffaloes have disappeared; they do not live by
hunting; they cultivate very little ground; they use little even to
pasture their ponies. They are fed and clothed by the Government,
and they camp about the agencies in idleness, under conditions that
pauperize them, destroy their manhood, degrade them into dependent,
vicious lives. The reservations ought to be sold, and the
