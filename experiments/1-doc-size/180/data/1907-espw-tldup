experimented on one of the students ! " 

" When I found the dog," continued Sterling 
Hart, " he had recognized you. Before you made 
your first incision, he was trying to kiss your hand 
— I see it in my dreams, yet ; I shall, I think, for 
a while; the worst of it was that poor Clyde thought 
he had found a friend." 

The preacher's two hands, which had fallen before 
him, were clenched together ; his large fingers 

 

showed in the moonlight purple from the knuckles 
to the tips. 

" Do you suppose if she knew," he demanded, 
" if she knew — " 

" A mistake ! A misfortune ! A wretched acci- 
dent ! " cried the vivisector. " Why need she ever 
know? " 

" Why ? " replied the preacher, in a low, vibrant 
tone. " To spare her from the same fate, — from 
the most distant possibility of it, I mean." 

The physiologist sprang, and for the instant it 
seemed as if he would have struck his pastor — 
man to man. But he controlled and recovered 
himself. 

" You take advantage of your cloth," he mut- 
tered. " What do you expect me to do ? " 

" I expected you to answer just as you have," 
replied Mr. Hart, quite undisturbed. " It is 
unavoidable, perhaps. So is the cause of offense 
which I have felt compelled to give you. You do 
not know my cousin," the clergyman hurried on 
with evidences of deep emotion. " It is not in your 
nature to understand her. She is not like other 
women — not like most of them. She is — she has 
a sensitiveness, a capacity for suffering that I — 
that you — There are so many ways of doing it ! 
It is true that I am, as I am likely to remain, a 
lonely man. You need not remind me of that. 

 

But you may not understand what confidences 
men and women give their pastors. I know something 
what the risks of marriage are. A man may 
vivisect a woman nerve by nerve, anguish by
anguish, as truly as if he put the scalpel to the tissue. 
And nobody knows it. She never cries out — " 

" Nobody knows it except her clergyman," shot 
back Frost, with a vitriolic glance. 

" Or her physician," responded Mr. Hart, 
pleasantly. "We strike the confessional out of the 
account." 

" Go on," came grimly from the physiologist. 

" I am going on," firmly said the clergyman. " I 
am going on to tell you, Thomas Frost, that he 
must be a tenderer man than you are who shall 
win a heart like hers and take her life into his 
keeping." 

Dr. Frost looked out to sea with dark, averted 
face ; his lips twitched. 

" I take it for granted that you would rather 
give up — whatever chance you suppose yourself 
to have with her — than to have her know ? " said 
Cara's cousin, quietly. 

" Rather than to have her know — yes. I would 
give her up." 

" I need no other justification of what I have 
done than that reply," said the preacher, distinctly. 
" Forgive me or not, as you choose. I can hardly 

 

expect that you ever will ; but that is a secondary- 
matter. My impressions are, however, that you will 
see that I had no escape from this ; and that you, 
in my place, would have done the same." 

" Perhaps I should," said Frost, with a forced, 
nervous smile. " Mr. Hart," he added, " you strike 
the villain out of the play in the first act. It doesn't 
seem to me good art." 

" It 's good conscience, at all events. And good 
art and good conscience are one, to my thinking," 
replied the preacher, more softly. " I could see no 
other way. I have thought it all through, as I told 
you." 

He spoke sadly, and seemed suddenly very tired. 
The overwrought, overwearied modern look on his 
sturdy, antique features seemed curiously out of 
place. He had the physiognomy of a man for whom 
Nature meant life to be " a Roman holiday " ; one 
who should have drawn his breath in joy, and 
raised his prayers to beauty, and worn the civic 
laurels of a happy state in ease of heart. 

" And yet," pleaded the experimenter, with an 
obvious effort to turn the interview from the 
painful personal form which it had taken, "we are con- 
scientious, too. We do not act from brutal motives. 
As a university man you must know us well enough 
to know that the development of Science — " He 
paused; 

 

" Yes," said Sterling Hart, " I used to feel just 
so. I know the point of view. There are others, 
that's air 

" You are not going against us ! " exclaimed 
Frost, quickly. " You ? " 

" I have not mastered the question," replied the 
preacher, thoughtfully. " I am a pretty busy man. 
But I mean to, as soon as I can. It may be as 
important as the church calendar — who knows?" 

" You trip at the personal equation," said Dr. 
Frost, bitterly. 

" There are subjects which it takes the personal 
equation to manage. Nothing else can," answered 
Sterling Hart. " Good-night, Frost," he said gently, 
as he went up the steps. 

" Be careful in case Clyde is about anywhere," 
he added, with genuine concern. " Sometimes he 
gets out these bright nights. I should be sorry to 
have you hurt. Better go home by the road." 

The physiologist ground his teeth, but took the 
advice. He pulled his hat over his eyes, and got 
savagely away. 

He paced the road aimlessly for a time, unable 
to collect himself. The vortex into which his calm, 
cold nature was plunged astonished him. He found 
himself in a condition which he did not know how 
to demonstrate and could not classify. In the course 
of an equable and healthy life he had experienced 

 

so little discomfort of mind or body that he was 
puzzled by it. Pain was a blatant stranger, forcing 
itself upon him without an apology. Instinctively 
he had turned in the opposite direction from the 
preachers house, and this led him past the wooded 
avenue of the Sterling place. It was a large estate, 
of which the Reverend Mr. Hart's had originally 
been a portion, and it extended across the road 
among some soft meadow land and pretty woodlots 
of a mythical value. A small cottage, white, like the 
Sterling mansion, and half on fire with climbing 
nasturtiums, leaned back a little from the road ; it 
had a homelike, cosy air, attractive to a quiet taste, 
beside the stately places among which it stood 
almost alone. This cottage, sometimes held open 
for the convenience of relatives or friends, 
sometimes rented to an irreproachable summer tenant,
