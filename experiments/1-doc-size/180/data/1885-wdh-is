Colville laughed at this too, and soon after the 
clergyman appeared. Imogene met him so coldly 
that Colville felt obliged to make him some amends 
by a greater show of cordiality than he felt. But 
he was glad of the effort, for he began to like him 



 

as he talked to him ; it was easy for him. to like 
people ; the young man showed sense and judg- 
ment, and if he was a little academic in his mind 
and manners, Colville tolerantly reflected that some 
people seemed to be born so, and that he was pro- 
bably not artiiicial, as he had once imagined from 
the ecclesiastical scrupulosity of his dress. 

Imogene ebbed away to the piano in the corner of 
the room, and struck some chords on it. At each 
stroke the young clergyman, whose eyes had. wan- 
dered a little toward her from the first, seemed to 
vibrate in response. The conversation became in- 
coherent before Mrs. Bowen joined them. Then, by 
a series of illogical processes, the clergyman was 
standing beside Imogene at the piano, and Mrs. 
Bowen was sitting beside Colville on the sofa. 

" Isn't there to be any Effie, to-night ? " he asked. 

" No. She has been up too much of late. And 
I wished to speak with you — about Imogene." 

" Yes," said Colville, not very eagerly. At that 
moment he could have chosen another topic. 

" It is time that her mother should have got my 
letter. In less than a fortnight we ought to have 
an answer." 

" Well ? " said Colville, with a strange constric- 
tion of the heart. 

"Her mother is a person of very strong char- 
acter ; her husband is absorbed in business, and 
defers to her in everything." 

" It isn't an uncommon American situation," said 
Colville, relieving his tension by this excursion. 



 

Mrs. Bowen ignored it. " I don't know how she 
may look at the affair. She may give her assent at 
once, or she may decide that nothing has taken place 
till — she sees you." 

" I could hardly blame her for that," he answered 
submissively. 

" It isn't a question of that," said Mrs. Bowen. 
" It 's a question of — others. Mr. Morton was here 
before you came, and I know he was interested in 
Imogene — I am certain of it. He has come back, 
and he sees no reason why he should not renew his 
attentions." 

" No— O—O," faltered Colville. 

" I wish you to realise the fact." 

" But what would you " 

" I told you," said Mrs. Bowen, with a full return 
of that severity whose recent absence Colville had 
found so comfortable, " that I can't advise or sug- 
gest anything at all." 

He was long and miserably silent. At last, " Did 
you ever think," he asked, " did you ever suppose- 
that is to say, did you ever suspect that — she — that 
Imogene was — at all interested in him ? " 

"I think she was — at one time," said Mrs. Bowen 
promptly. 

Colville sighed, with a wandering disposition to 
whistle. 

" But that is nothing," she went on. " People 
have many passing fancies. The question is, what 
are you going to do now ? I want to know, as Mr. 
Morton's friend." 



 

" Ah, I wish you wanted to know as my friend, 
Mrs. Bowen ! " A sudden thought flashed upon , 
him. " Why shouldn't I go away from Florence 
till Imogene hears from her mother ? That seemed 
to me right in the first place. There is no tie that 
binds her to me. I hold her to nothing. If she 
finds in my absence that she likes this young man 

better " An expression of Mrs. Bowen's face 

stopped him. He perceived that he had said some- 
thing very shocking to her ; he perceived that the 
thing was shocking in itself, but it was not that 
which he cared for. " I don't mean that I won't 
hold myself true to her as long as she will. I re- 
cognise my responsibility fully. I know that I am 
answerable for all this, and that no one else is ; and 
I am ready to bear any penalty. But what I can't 
bear is that you should misunderstand me, that you 

should I have been so wretched ever since 

you first began to blame me for my part in this, and 
so happy this past fortnight that I can't — I won't — 
go back to that state of things. No ; you have no 
right to relent toward me, and then fling me off as 
you have tried to do to-night ! I have some feeling 
too — some rights. You shall receive me as a friend, 
or not at all ! How can I live if you " 

She had been making little efforts as if to rise ; 
now she forced herself to her feet, and ran jrom 
the room. 

The young people looked up from their music ; 
some wave of the sensation had spread to them, but 
seeing Colville remain seated, they went on with 



 

their playing till he rose. Then Imogene called out, 
" Isn't Mrs. Bowen coming back ? " 

" I don't know ; I think not," answered Colville 
stupidly, standing where he had risen. 

She hastened questioning toward him. "What 
is -the matter ? Isn't she well ? " 

Mr. Morton's face expressed a polite share in 
her anxiety. 

" Oh yes ; quite, I believe," Colville replied. 

" She heard Effie call, I suppose," suggested the 
girl. 

" Yes, yes ; I think so ; that is — yes. I must 
be going. Good night." 

He took her hand and went away, leaving the 
clergyman still there ; but he lingered only for a re- 
port from Mrs. Bowen, which Imogene hurried to get. 
She sent word that she would join them presently. 
But Mr. Morton said that it was late already, and he 
would beg Miss Graham to say good-night for him. 
When Mrs. Bowen returned Imogene was alone. 

She did not seem surprised or concerned at that. 
" Imogene, I have been talldng to Mr. Colville 
about you and Mr. Morton." 

The girl started and turned pale. 

"It is almost time to hear from your mother, and 
she may consent to your engagement. Then you 
must be prepared to act."
