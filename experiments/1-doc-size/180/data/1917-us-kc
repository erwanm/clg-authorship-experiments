workers out of a few tons of coal ! And so on, for several 
minutes. 

" Mr. Cartwright," said Edstrom, when the other had 
finished, " you know I've worked all my life in mines, and 
most of it in this district. I am telling you something I 
know when I say there is general dissatisfaction through- 
out these camps because the men feel they are not getting 
their weight. You say there has been no public com- 
plaint ; you understand the reason for this — " 

" What is the reason ? " 

" Well," said Edstrom, gently, " maybe you don't know 
the reason^ — but anyway we've decided that we want a 
check-weighman." 

It was evident that the superintendent had been taken 
by surprise, and was uncertain how to meet the issue. 
" You can imagine," he said, at last, " the company 
doesn't relish hearing that its men believe it's cheating 
them — " 

"We don't say the company knows anything about it, 
Mr. Cartwright. It's possible that some people may be 
taking advantage of us, without either the company or 
yourself having anything to do with it. It's for your 
protection as well as ours that a check-weighman is 
needed." 

" Thank you," said the other, drily. His tone revealed 
that he was holding himself in by an effort. " Very well," 
he added, at last. " That's enough about the matter, if 
your minds are made up. I'll give you my decision later." 

This was a dismissal, and Mike Sikoria turned humbly, 
and started to the door. But Edstrom was one of the 
ants that did not readily " step one side " ; and Mike took 
a glance at him, and then stepped back into line in a 
hurry ^ as if hoping his delinquency had not been noted. 

" If you please, Mr. Cartwright," said Edstrom, " we'd 
like your decision, so as to have the check-weighman start 
in the morning." 



 

" What ? You're in such a hurry ? " 

" There's no reason for delay, sir. We've selected our 
man, and we're ready to pay him." 

" Who are the men who are ready to pay him ? Just 
you two ? " 

" I am not at liberty to name the other men, sir." 

" Oh ! So it's a secret movement ! " 

" In a way — yes, sir." 

" Indeed ! " said the superintendent, ominously. " And 
you don't care what the company thinks about it ! " 

" It's not that, Mr. Cartwright, but we don't see any- 
thing for the company to object to. It's a simple business 
arrangement — " 

"Well, if it seems simple to you, it doesn't to me," 
snapped the other. And then, getting himself in hand, 
" Understand me, the company would not have the least 
objection to the men making sure of their weights, if they 
really think it's necessary. The company has always been 
willing to do the right tiling. But it's not a matter that 
can be settled off hand. I will let you know later." 

Again they were dismissed, and again Old Mike turned, 
and Edstrom also. But now another ant sprang into the 
ditch. " Just when will you be prepared to let the check- 
weighman begin work, Mr. Cartwright ? " asked Hal. 

The superintendent gave him a sharp look, and again 
it could be seen that he made a strong effort to keep his 
temper. "I'm not prepared to say," he replied. "I 
will let you know, as soon as convenient to me. That's 
all now." And as he spoke he opened the door, putting 
something into the action that was a command. 

"Mr. Cartwright," said Hal, "there's no law against 
our having a check-weighman, is there ? " 

The look which these words drew from the superin- 
tendent showed that he knew full well what the law was. 
Hal accepted this look as an answer, and continued, "I 
have been selected by a committee of the men to act as 




their check-weighman, and this committee has duly noti- 
fied the company. That makes me a check-weighman, I 
believe, Mr. Cartwright, and so all I have to do is to as- 
sume my duties." Without waiting for the superintend- 
ent's answer, he walked to the door, followed by his some- 
what shocked companions. 



 At the meeting on the night before it had been 
agreed to spread the news of the check-weighman move- 
ment, for the sake of its propaganda value. So now when 
the three men came out from the office, there was a crowd 
waiting to know what had happened ; men clamoured ques- 
tions, and each one who got the story would be surrounded 
by others eager to hear. Hal made his way to the board- 
ing-house, and when he had finished his supper, he set out 
from place to place in the camp, telling the men about the 
check-weighman plan and explaining that it was a legal 
right they were demanding. All this while Old Mike 
stayed on one side of him, and Edstrom on the other ; for 
Tom Olson had insisted strenuously that Hal should not 
be left alone for a moment. Evidently the bosses had 
given the same order ; for when Hal came out from Eemi- 
nitsky's, there was " Jake " Predovich, the store-clerk, on 
the fringe of the crowd, and he followed wherever Hal 
went, doubtless making note of every one he spoke to. 

They consulted as to where they were to spend the night 
Old Mike was nervous, taking the activities of the spy to 
mean that they were to be thugged in the darkness. He 
told horrible stories of that sort of thing. What could be 
an easier way for the company to settle the matter ? They 
would fix up some story ; the world outside would believe 
they had been killed in a drunken row, perhaps over some 
woman. This last suggestion especially troubled Hal ; he 
thought of the people at home. No, he must not sleep in 
the village ! And on the other hand he could not go down 



 

the canyon, for if he once passed the gate, he might not 
be allowed to repass it. * 

An idea occurred to him. Why not go up the canyon ? 
There was no stockade at the upper end of the village — 
nothing but wilderness and rocks, without even a road. 

" But where we sleep ? " demanded Old Mike, aghast. 

" Outdoors," said Hal. 

" Pluha, biedna! And get the night air into my 
bones ? " 

" You think you keep the day air in your bones when 
you sleep inside ? " laughed Hal. 

" Why don't I, when I shut them windows tight, and 
cover up my bones ? " 

" Well, risk the night air once," said Hal. " It's bet- 
ter than having somebody let it into you with a knife." 

" But that fellow Predovich — he follow us up canyon 
too!" 

" Yes, but he's only one man, and we don't have to fear 
him. If he went back for others, he'd never be able to 
find us in the darkness." 

Edstrom, whose notions of anatomy were not so crude 
as Mike's, gave his support to this suggestion ; so they got 
their blankets and stumbled up the canyon in the still, 
star-lit night. For a while they heard the spy behind 
them, but finally his footsteps died away, and after they 
had moved on for some distance, they believed they were
