would be forced to give way, and the tactics of solidarity 
would triumph. 

So Hal went on, recalling the things Olson had told him, 
and putting them into practice. He saw hope in their 
faces again, dispelling the mood of resentment and rage. 

" Now, boys," said he, " I'm going in to see the super- 
intendent for you. I'll be your committee, since they've 
shipped out the rest." 

The steam-siren of Ferris bellowed again: "You're 
the boy ! Joe Smith ! " 

" All right, men — now mind what I say ! I'll see the 
super, and then I'll go down to Pedro, where there'll be 
some officers of the United Mine-workers this morning. 
I'll tell them the situation, and ask them to back you. 
That's what you want, is it ? " 

That was what they wanted. " Big union ! " 



( 



 

" All right. I'll do the best I can for you, and I'll find 
some way to get word to you. And meantime you stand 
firm. The bosses will tell you lies, they'll try to deceive 
you, they'll send spies and trouble-makers among you — 
but you hold fast, and wait for the big union." 

Hal stood looking at the cheering crowd. He had time 
to note some of the faces upturned to him. Pitiful, toil- 
worn faces they were, each making its separate appeal, 
telling its individual story of deprivation and defeat 
Once more they were transfigured, shining with that 
wonderful new light which he had seen for the first time 
the previous evening. It had been crushed for a moment, 
but it flamed up again; it would never die in the hearts 
of men — once they had learned the power it gave. Noth- 
ing Hal had yet seen moved him so much as this new birth 
of enthusiasm. A beautiful, a terrible thing it was ! 

Hal looked at his brother, to see how he had been moved. 
What he saw on his brother's face was satisfaction, bound- 
less relief. The matter had turned out all right! Hal 
was coming away!

Hal turned again to the men ; somehow, after his glance 
at Edward, they seemed more pitiful than ever. For Ed- 
ward typified the power they were facing — the unseeing, 
uncomprehending power that meant to crush them. The 
possibility of failure was revealed to Hal in a flash of emo- 
tion, overwhelming him. He saw them as they would be, 
when no leader was at hand to make speeches to them. 
He saw them waiting, their life-long habit of obedience 
striving to reassert itself ; a thousand fears besetting them, 
a thousand rumours preying upon them — wild beasts set 
on them by their cunning enemies. They would suffer, 
not merely for themselves, but for their wives and chil- 
dren — the very same pangs of dread that Hal suffered 
when he thought of one old man up in Western City, whose 
doctors had warned him to avoid excitement. 

If they stood firm, if they kept their bargain with 



 

their leader, they would be evicted from their homes, they 
would face the cold of the coming winter, they would face 
hunger and the black-list. And he, meantime — what 
would he be doing? What was his part of the bargain? 
He would interview the superintendent for them, he would 
turn them over to the " big union " — and then he would 
go off to his own life of ease and pleasure. To eat grilled 
steaks and hot rolls in a perfectly appointed club, with 
suave and softly-moving servitors at his beck! To dance 
at the country club with exquisite creatures of chiffon and 
satin, of perfume and sweet smiles and careless, happy 
charms! No, it was too easy! He might call that his 
duty to his father and brother, but he would know in his 
heart that it was treason to life ; it was the devil, taking 
him onto a high mountain and showing him all the king- 
doms of the earth ! 

Moved by a sudden impulse, Hal raised his hands once 
more. " Boys," he said, " we understand each other now. 
You'll not go back to work till the big union tells you. 
And I, for my part, will stand by you. Your cause is my 
cause, I'll go on fighting for you till you have your rights, 
till you can live and work as men ! Is that right ? " 

"' That's right ! That's right ! " 

" Very good, then — we'll swear to it ! " And Hal 
raised his hands, and the men raised theirs, and amid a 
storm of shouts, and a frantic waving of caps, he made 
them the pledge which he knew would bind his own con- 
science. He made it deliberately, there in his brother's 
presence. This was no mere charge on a trench, it was en- 
listing for a war ! But even in that moment of fervour, 
Hal would have been frightened had he realised the pe- 
riod of that enlistment, the years of weary and desperate 
conflict to which he was pledging his life. 



Hal descended from his rostrum, and the crowds 



 

made way for him, and with his brother at his side he went 
down the street to the office building, upon the porch of 
which the guards were standing. His progress was a tri- 
umphal one ; rough voices shouted words of encouragement 
in his ears, men jostled and fought to shake his hand or to 
pat him on the back ; they even patted Edward and tried to 
shake his hand, because he was with Hal, and seemed to 
have his confidence. Afterwards Hal thought it over and 
was merry. Such an adventure for Edward ! 

The younger man went up the steps of the building and 
spoke to the guards. " I want to see Mr. Cartwright." 

" He's inside," answered one, not cordially. With Ed- 
ward following, Hal entered, and was ushered into the pri- 
vate office of the superintendent. 

Having been a working-man, and class-conscious, Hal 
was observant of the manners of mine-superintendents; 
he noted that Cartwright bowed politely to Edward, but 
did not include Edward's brother. "Mr. Cartwright," 
he said, " I have come to you as a deputation from the 
workers of this camp." 

The superintendent did not appear impressed by the 
announcement. 

" I am instructed to say that the men demand the re- 
dress of four grievances before they return to work. 
First — " 

Here Cartwright spoke, in his quick, sharp way. 
" There's no use going on, sir. This company will deal 
only with its men as individuals. It will recognise no 
deputations." 

Hal's answer was equally quick. "Very well, Mr. 
Cartwright. In that case, I come to you as an individual." 

For a moment the superintendent seemed nonplussed. 

" I wish to ask four rights which are granted to me by 
the laws of this state. First, the right to belong to a 
union, without being discharged for it." 

The other had recovered his manner of quiet mastery. 



 

"You have that right, sir ; you have always had it. You 
know perfectly well that the company has never discharged 
any one for belonging to a union," 

The man was looking at Hal, and there was a duel of 
the eyes between them. A cold anger moved Hal. His 
ability to endure this sort of thing was at an end. " Mr. 
Cartwright," he said, " you are the servant of one of the 
world's greatest actors; and you support him ably."
