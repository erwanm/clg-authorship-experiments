J think it is to oneself." 

"What?" 

" O, one's life, you know." 

" But ten years is not a life," said Norton. 

" It is, if one hasn't lived any longer." 

" I would like my life to be history to other 
people," said Norton. " Something worth 
while." 

" I wouldn't like other people to know my 
life, though," said Matilda. 

" Then could not help it, if it was something worth while," said Norton. 



 

" Why yes, Norton ; one's life is what one 
thinks and feels ; what nobody knows. Not 
the things that everybody knows." 

" It is what one does" said Norton ; " and 
if you do anything worth while, people will 
know it. I wonder what there will be to tell 
of you and me fifty years from now ? " 

" Fifty years ! Why, then I should be 
sixty-one," said Matilda ; " and you would 
be a good deal more than that. But perhaps 
we shall not live to be so old." 

" Yes we shall," said Norton. " J shall ; 
and you must, too." 

" Why, Norton, we can't make ourselves 
live," said Matilda, in great astonishment at
this language. 

"We shall live to be old, though," said 
Norton. " I know it. And I wish there may 
be something to be said of me. I don't think 
women ought to be talked of." 

" I do not see what good it would do anybody to be talked of, after he has gone away 
out of the world," said Matilda. " Except to 




be talked of in heaven. That would be 
good." 

In heaven ! " said Norton. Talked of in 
heaven ! Where did you get that ? " 

" I don't mean that exactly," said Matilda. 
" But some people will." 
. Who ? " 

" Why, a great many people, Norton. 
Abraham, and Noah, and David, and Daniel, 
and the woman that put all she had into the 
Lord's treasury, and the woman that anointed 
the head of Jesus the woman who, he said, 
had done what she could. I would like to 
have that said of me, if it was Jesus that 
said it." 

Norton took hold of Matilda and gave her 
a little good-humoured shake. " Stop that!" 
he said ; " and tell me is that why you are 
carrying a Bible out here in the streets ? " 

" O I haven't any use for it here, Nor- 
ton." 

" Then what have you got it here for ? " 

" Norton, there are some people in the vil- 




lage who are sick, or cannot read ; and I was 
going to read to them." 

" Where are they ? " 

" In Lilac lane." 

" Where is that ? " 

" You go up past the corner a good way, 
and just by Mr. Earth's foundry you turn 
down a few steps, and turn again at the 
baker's. Then, a little way further on, you 
strike into the lane." 

"That's it, is it? I know. But do you 
know what sort of people live up that 
way ? " 

" Yes." 

" Well, there's another thing you don't 
know, and that's the mud. You'd never 
have got out again, if you had gone to Lilac 
lane to-day. It is three feet deep; and it 
weighs twenty pounds a foot. After you set 
your shoe in it you want a windlass to get it 
out again." 

" What is a windlass ? " Matilda asked. 

" Don't you know ? Well, you are a girl ; 




but you are a brick. I'll teach you about a 
windlass, and lots of things." 

" I shouldn't think you would want to teach 
me, because I am a girl," said Matilda. 

They had reached the iron gate of Mrs. 
Laval's domain, walking fast as they had 
talked ; and in answer to Matilda's last remark, Norton opened the gate for her, and 
took off his cap with an air as he held it for 
her to pass in. Matilda looked, smiled, and 
stepped past him. 

" You are not like any boy I ever saw," 
she remarked, when he had recovered his cap 
and his place beside her. 

" I hope you like me better than any one 
you ever saw ? " 

Yes," said Matilda, " I do." 

The boy's answer, was to do what most 
boys are too shy or too proud for. He put 
his arms round Matilda and gave her a hearty 
kiss. Matilda was greatly surprised, and 
bridled a little, as if she thought Norton had 
taken a liberty ; but on the whole seemed to 




recognize the fact that they were very gooiV 
friends, and took this as a seal of it. Norton 
led her into the house, got his croquet box, 
and brought her and it out again to the little lawn before the door. Nobody else was 
visible. The day was still, dry, and sunny, 
and though the grass was hardly green yet 
and not shaven nor rolled nor anything that a 
croquet lawn ought to be, still it would do, 
as Norton said, to look at. Matilda stood by 
and listened intently, while he planted his 
hoops and shewed his mallets and explained 
to her the initial mysteries of the game. They 
even tried how it would go ; and there was 
no doubt of one thing, the time went almost 
as fast as the croquet balls. 

" I must run home, Norton," Matilda said 
at last. 

" Why ? I don't think so." 

" I know I must."
