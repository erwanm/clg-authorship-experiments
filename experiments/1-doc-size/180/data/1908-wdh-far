Miss Shirley was feeling it a slight, she was too secret 
or too sweet to let it be known, and he thought that was 
nice of her. Still, he believed he might recognize the 
fact without deepening a possible hurt of hers, and he 
added, with no apparent relevance, " If Mrs. Westangle 
was not looking for us on this train, she will find that 
it is the unexpected which happens." 

" We are certainly going to happen," the girl said, 
with an acceptance of the plural which deepened the 
intimacy of the situation, and which was not displeasing 
to Verrian when she added, " If our friend's vehicle 
holds out." Then she turned her face full upon him, 
with what affected him as austere resolution, in con- 
tinuing, " But I can't let you suppose that you're con- 
veying a society person, or something of that sort, to 
Mrs. Westangle's." His own face expressed his mystifi- 

 

cation, and she concluded, " I'm simply going there to 
begin my work." 

He smiled provisionally in temporizing with the rid- 
dle. " You women are wonderful, nowadays, for the 
work you do." 

" Oh, but," she protested, nervously, anxiously, " it 
isn't good work that I'm going to do — I understand 
what you mean — it's work for a living. I've no busi- 
ness to be arriving with an invited guest, but it seemed 
to be a question of arriving or not at the time when I 
was due."

Verbian stared at her now from a visage that was an 
entire blank, though behind it conjecture was busy, and 
he was asking himself whether his companion was some 
new kind of hair - dresser, or uncommonly cultivated 
manicure, or a nursery governess obeying a hurry call to 
take a place in Mrs. Westangle's household, or some sort 
of amateur housekeeper arriving to supplant a profes- 
sional. But he said nothing. 

Miss Shirley said, with a distress which was genuine, 
though he perceived a trace of amusement in it, too, 
" I see that I will have to go on." 

" Oh, do !" he made out to utter. 

" I am going to Mrs. Westangle's as a sort of mistress 
of the revels. The business is so new that it hasn't 
got its name yet, but if I fail it won't need any. I 
invented it on a hint I got from a girl who undertakes 
the floral decorations for parties. I didn't see why 
some one shouldn't furnish suggestions for amusements, 
as well as flowers. I was always rather lucky at that 
in my own f am — at my father's — " She pulled herself 
sharply up, as if danger lay that way. " I got an 
introduction to Mrs. Westangle, and she's to let me try. 
I am going to her simply as part of the catering, and 
I'm not to have any recognition in the hospitalities. So 
it wasn't necessary for her to send for me at the station, 
except as a means of having me on the ground in good 
season. I have to thank you for that, and — I thank 
you." She ended in a sigh. 

 

" It's very interesting," Verrian said, and he hoped 
he was not saying it in any ignoble way. 

He was very presently to learn. Bound a turn of the 
road there came a lively clacking of horses' shoes on 
the hard track, with the muted rumble of rubber-tired 
wheels, and Mrs. Westangle's victoria dashed into view. 
The coachman had made a signal to Verrian's driver, 
and the vehicles stopped side by side. The footman 
instantly came to the door of the carryall, touching his 
hat to Verrian. 

" Going to Mrs. Westangle's, sir ?" 

" Yes." 

" Mrs. Westangle's carriage. Going to the station 
for you, sir." 

" Miss Shirley," Verrian said, " will you change ?" 

" Oh no," she answered, quickly, " it's better for me 
to go on as I am. But the carriage was sent for you. 
You must — " 

Verrian interrupted to ask the footman, " How far 
is it yet to Mrs. Westangle's ?" 

" About a mile, sir." 

" I think I won't change for such a short distance. 
I'll keep on as I am," Verrian said, and he let the goat- 
skin, which he had half lifted to free Miss Shirley for 
dismounting, fall back again. " Go ahead, driver." 

She had been making several gasping efforts at 
speech, accompanied with entreating and protesting 
glances at Verrian in the course of his brief colloquy 
with the footman. Now, as the carryall lurched for- 
ward again, and the victoria wheeled and passed them 
on its way back, she caught her handkerchief to her 
face, and to Verrian's dismay sobbed into it. He let 
her cry, as he must, in the distressful silence which he 
could not be the first to break. Besides, he did not 
know how she was taking it all till she suddenly with- 

 

drew her handkerchief and pulled down her veil. Then 
she spoke three heart-broken words, " How could you !" 
and he divined that he must have done wrong. 

" What ought I to have done ?" he asked, with sullen 
humility. 

" You ought to have taken the victoria." 

"How could I?" 

" You ought to have done it." 

" I think you ought to have done it yourself, Miss 
Shirley," Verrian said, feeling like the worm that 
turns. He added, less resentfully, " We ought both to 
have taken it." 

" No, Mrs. Westangle might have felt, very properly, 
that it was presumptuous in me, whether I came alone 
in it or with you. Now we shall arrive together in 
this thing, and she will be mortified for you and vexed 
with me. She will blame me for it, and she will be 
right, for it would have been very well for me to 
drive up in a shabby station carryall; but an invited 
guest — " 

" No, indeed, she shall not blame you, Miss Shirley. 
I will make a point of taking the whole responsibility. 
I will tell her—" 

" Mr. Merriam !" she cried, in anguish. " Will you 
please do nothing of the kind ? Do you want to make 
bad worse? Leave the explaining altogether to me, 
please. Will you promise that V 

" I will promise that — or anything — if you insist," 
Verrian sulked. 

She instantly relented a little. " You mustn't think 
me unreasonable. But I was determined to carry my 
undertaking through on business principles, and you 
have spoiled my chance — I know you meant it kindly — 
or, if not spoiled, made it more difficult. Don't think 
me ungrateful. Mr. Merriam — " 



" My name isn't Merriam," lie resented, at last, a 
misnomer which had annoyed him from the first. 

" Oh, I am so glad ! Don't tell me what it is !" she 
said, giving a laugh which had to go on a little before 
he recognized the hysterical quality in it. When she 
could check it she explained : " Now we are not even 
acquainted, and I can thank a stranger for the kindness 
you have shown me. I am truly grateful. Will you do 
me another favor ?" 

"Yes," Verrian assented; hut he thought he had a
