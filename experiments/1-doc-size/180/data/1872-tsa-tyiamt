over. " It can t be possible !" I answered back, and 
lifting the paper, read again. I did not speak of it 
to any one, and tried to banish it from my mind, but 
that was not to be done. 

I missed from the bar-room, after this trouble with 
Ned Allen, several familiar faces. Among them was 
that of John Ashley. Most of the boys had kept 
away, at which -I was better pleased than otherwise. 
We got considerable out of them one week with an 
other, but there was a law against selling to minors, 
and here was about our only danger of getting trip 
ped. Besides, Ned Allen 's fall had caused a great 
deal of talking among the men, and one or two of 



 

them more than hinted that if we did not stop sell 
ing liquor to the lads complaint would be made. 

On the evening after a notice of the death of Mr. 
Allen and his wife appeared in the newspapers, we 
had in an unusual number of workmen from the 
bindery and printing-office. They came to talk 
about the matter, and to learn what they could 
about it from each other. It had caused, I found, a 
good deal of stir. Putting this and that together as 
it came out, I learned that when Mr. Allen got home 
with his son, and the mother came to know of their 
sorrow and disgrace, the poor old lady was stricken 
down as if dead, and did not come to for a long time. 
Adding the shock and alarm of this to the crushing 
weight under which he was trying to hold himself 
up was too much for the heart-broken father to bear, 
and nature kindly gave him ease in unconscious 
ness. 

Out of this he came at length, but in mind and 
body so weak that he seemed almost gone. He ral 
lied but little never sufficient to leave his bed. So 
he lingered on for a week. His wife came up better. 
Anxiety for her husband caused her strength to re 
turn, and she kept about him night and day, doing 
all in her power to save him. But in vain. Body, 
heart and brain had all been overworked too long, 
and there was not enough vitality left to meet the 
sudden and large demand this terrible shock had 
occasioned. And so he passed to his rest. It was 
said that up to the moment of his death his wife 



 

showed no signs of breaking down, but that when 
all was over, and friends tried to lift her face away 
from the dead face of her husband, her life seemed 
to be going out with his. She never spoke to any 
one afterward, nor seemed to hear any voice that 
called to her, but was like one heavy with sleep. In 
a few hours her pulses too were still and her heart 
cold. 

My thoughts troubled me that night. A heavy 
weight lay on my feelings which I tried vainly to 
shake off. Was I not guilty of the death of this good 
old man ? The anguish of spirit, too bitter for human 
strength to bear, that had occasioned it, I helped to 
lay on his stooping and overburdened shoulders. 
And the unhappy boy I had assisted to snare and 
ruin, what was to become of him ? what was to be 
his fate ? 

I tossed through the night, haunted by thoughts 
like these, unable to sleep and longing for the day 
to come. But with the day I went back to my 
work, and pushed them all aside. What had I to 
do with consequences? If men or boys chose to 
drink, steal, rob or commit murder, that was their 
own affair, not mine, and they must reap as they 
sowed. I was sorry if any one suffered, but the 
blame was with him alone. 

For a while after this things went on in the usual 
way, and the death of Mr. Allen became an incident 
of the past, and was rarely mentioned. No one 
seemed to know anything about Ned Allen, but it 



 

was a common impression that he would come to no 
good. John Ashley and other minors from the 
establishment next door drifted back among us and 
enjoyed themselves as before. 

But in the nature of things, we could not be long 
at peace. Affairs would not run smoothly. An 
element of discord was continually showing itself, 
fretting and disturbing us. We were making money, 
but not really enjoying our gains. It was a rare 
thing for me to lie down at night with a tranquil 
mind and peaceful thoughts. Scarcely a day went 
by without some unpleasant incident. Now it would 
be an angry dispute among two half-tipsy custom 
ers ; now a bar-room row, with a show of knives or 
pistols, and sometimes their use ; now the appear 
ance of a father in search of his son, or of a poor 
forlorn-looking mother after her wandering boy ; and 
now the irritating ordeal of being compelled to listen 
to a general discussion about the character of our 
business and the evil we were doing. Hundreds of 
times have I wished myself well out of it. 

Several months had passed since our last visit 
from the strange woman closely veiled who had 
come in with the silent step and movement of a 
ghost, and then, after glancing through the bar 
room, as silently retired, and we did not expect to 
see her again. But one night it was nearly eleven 

o clock as a gentleman named L , well known 

in the city and eminent in his profession, stood at 
the bar drinking, I saw her enter. The gentleman 's 



 

back was turned toward the door, and he did not 
notice her. She was closely veiled, as before. Her 
dress was of some dark but fine material, and fell in 
graceful folds about her tall figure. A rich, dark 
shawl was drawn closely around her shoulders, and 
I saw the sparkle of a brilliant solitaire on one of 
her ungloved hands. Her other was thrust into the 
pocket of her dress. She stood for a moment or 
two in that statue-like way before mentioned, and 
then came swiftly but silently across the room, and 
laid a hand on the gentleman 's arm, at the same time 
drawing back a portion of her veil, so that on turn 
ing, as he did quickly, he could see her face. 

I saw it first, of course. It was the face of a wo 
man past thirty a face strongly marked, but beau 
tiful, the complexion a light brunette and the eyes 
large, black and brilliant. Every look and flash of 
her great eyes showed intense but repressed passion. 

Mr. L , on feeling the touch on his arm, turned 

with a start. As he did so, I saw the hand of the 
woman that still rested in the pocket of her dress 
move as if about to be withdrawn. For an instant 
they looked at each other, while I stood scared and 
breathless, for I had seen murder in the woman 's eyes. 

But only for an instant did she look at Mr. L . 

I saw her catch her breath, while a baffled and dis 
appointed expression swept over her face. Then 
with a swift movement her veil was drawn, and be 
fore the astonished Mr. L could utter a word 

she had vanished from the room. 



 

" Do you know that woman ?" he asked, in un 
feigned astonishment, and with considerable excite 
ment of manner. 

" I do not," I replied.
