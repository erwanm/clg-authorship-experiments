in the family background and as to whom, by the 
same magic of wanting to enough which had con 
stantly served him, he could be sure he was pas 
sably provided. The possibility of sickness was 
in the fall from such a proved independence of 
the baseness, as who should say, of pretending. 





  

Two or three times, yes, it might have appeared 
he should have to pretend, some gap in his inspi 
ration remaining too distinctly unbridged; but 
with that villainy always averted since positively 
it wore the villain's face by its having become 
in the very nick the mere mistake of his fear. He 
had thus again and again escaped being too super 
ficial, and with this gain of certitude of how little 
he was there to be so at all had come each time 
the sense of luxury in his renewals of recognition. 
That there would be no luxury in not recognising, 
his failure of vision in respect to a second daugh 
ter of the house instantly taught him, but even 
while it did so no repair of the lapse arrived. 

What Molly saw, and what in ten seconds more 
she would make the others see, was the fact of 
the lapse unrelieved the queerness of which for 
her was indeed already out with her asking him 
what was the matter and why in the world he 
looked at the mention of the dear thing at Dry- 
down as if he were going to be ill. The extraordi 
nary point of which withal was that she was her 
self ready the instant after to jump into detection 
verily, but detection of what wasn't not at all 
of what was. His so helplessly hanging fire rep 
resented clearly, to her freshened perception, and 
thereby his own still sharper embarrassment, that 
he had been thinking more of poor Nan than of 
the rest of them put together; though of course 
when she brought her large irony to bear on this 





  

he could luckily snatch at his obvious retort and 
make his flushed laugh invite their companions 
to see how it righted him. "Did it strike you, 
my dear, that when I asked you a while since to 
take up with me for life I was really but express 
ing my interest in another person ? If that was 
the case," he said to Mrs. Midmore and Perry, 
"I mean if I wasn't addressing her as an honest 
man which she accuses me of how could she 
guess it and yet at the same time make me such 
a blissfully happy one?" The question wasn't 
indeed in strictness for them to answer, and Molly, 
whatever they might have said, met it to her own 
sufficiency by another of her wondrous freedoms. 
"I could love you for a wretch, cousin, I think, 
as well as I could love you for a saint !" she cried; 
and it gave him at once, he seemed to feel, the 
luckiest chance for putting in his most vital plea. 

"I don't care what you love me for if it's only 
as your very truest and don't you see that when 
you doubt of my being so you deny by the same 
stroke that I'm the honest man I pretend ?" 

"Just listen to him, mother was there ever 
anything grander than such a speech and such an 
air?" Her appeal was of the promptest, and if 
she addressed her parent her eyes took note but 
of her lover, whom, with her head inclined to one 
side, she might almost have been regarding in the 
light of a splendid picture. "I don't care, I don't 
care it sets you off so to let me torment you. 





  

It's when I doubt of you," she said, "that you'll 
find me most adoring; and if you should ever 
dream I'm cold just draw me on to abuse you." 
She gave him at this moment and for the first 
time the oddest impression of studying him she 
had only hugged him before, with sentiment and 
sense there had been no pondering; and he could 
have wished now she would straighten her head, 
her carriage of which had an effect on his nerves. 
It didn't matter that he believed her not really 
to intend this when she wound up with a repeti 
tion of her idea that they must have his portrait, 
that they must make sure of it before that first 
bloom of his expression, as she curiously called it, 
should have died down; a particular need of his 
own came to a head under her scrutiny quite as 
much as if he feared probing. "I'm an honest 
man, I'm an honest man !" he said it twice over, 
strongly and simply, conscious of a sudden that 
he enormously wanted to, wanted to with an 
inward sharpness of which he had not yet felt 
the touch. It was a pressure from within that 
thus spoke, a pressure quite other than the driv 
ing force that had carried him so far and that he 
had known but by its effects, so rapidly multi 
plied, and somehow as dissociated from their 
starting-point or first producing cause as if that 
origin had been a spring pressed in somebody else. 
It was in himself, deep down somewhere, that his 
motion of protest had begun, and it really eased 





  

him to give it repeated voice even if when he 
had made the point, that of his honesty, four 
times over, he had come rather to resemble the 
lady in the play of whom it was remarked there 
that she protested too much. He felt himself 
verily colour with his emphasis, and that was not 
at once corrected by his having to face the ques 
tion straightway put by Perry, who on his side 
repeated the word once more. " ' Honest ' ? Pray 
who in the world, here, cousin, has rudely said 
you're not?" that was what he should have had 
in consequence decently to answer weren't it that 
his wish to clear himself to himself helped him to 
laugh, with whatever small flurry, at the challenge. 
"It isn't your rudeness, it's your extravagant 
flattery, you dear people, that makes me want to 
warn you that you may find me, on seeing more 
of me, less possessed of every virtue than you're 
so good as to insist." He looked with his becom 
ing blush from one of them to the other becom 
ing we call it because his act of difficulty and 
thereby of caution appeared to provoke in each 
of the women after all but a new, quite a brighter 
and fresher shade of interest. Were they going to 
like him uncertain better still than they had liked 
him certain, and if so to what should he look, 
besmothered as that must surely make him feel, 
for the comfort of knowing where he was for him 
self? Where he was for Molly, and by the same 
token for her mother, was told him by this pleasure 





  

they took in seeing how he had found, to his 
slight embarrassment, that there was something 
to explain. That it was that seemed to set him 
off in their eyes, which were so agreeably, if so 
oddly, affected by almost any trustful touch of 
nature or unexpectedness of truth in him. If he 
had hoped to please by intention, so he might 
perhaps have liked even better to please in spite 
of himself; notwithstanding which this last lia 
bility did to a degree contribute ease, or even, it 
might be, rather compromise dignity. He might 
for all the world have been growing, growing 
hard, growing fast; it had begun with the minute 
of his entering the house, and especially that room 
so that without knowing what at such a rate 
one might really grow to, one should not yield to
