"I guess not," I added. "That would be horrible."

"Why does she treat me so then--not even let me look out the window?"
sobbed she. "I think she wants my money. I have tried to think it was
not so, but I can't, ever since Ellen Windleton told me that."

"Why don't you tell Mr. Windleton how your step-mother treats you?"
asked Bob.

"He and his whole family are in Europe. They have been there more than a
year. I shall tell him when he comes back; but Mrs. Loraine is my
guardian."

"Ernest, we are almost over to Parkville, and it is time to know what we
are to do with Miss Loraine. It won't do to take her to Parkville," said
Bob.

"I will stay in the boat all night. That's a nice little place in
there," interposed Kate, pointing to the cuddy.

"You may go in there now, if you please," I added. "I will land you,
Bob, and take care of Kate myself. It is quite dark now, and I can take
her up to the cottage. No one will find her there."

"What will your uncle say?"

"He will not see her; if he does, he won't say anything; he never says
anything."

My friend was entirely willing to take his share of the responsibility,
but I was satisfied that I could dispose of my fair passenger without
any assistance. I landed him at the steamboat pier, and then stood over
towards the cottage.




CHAPTER V.

IN WHICH ERNEST IS AWAKENED BY A LOUD KNOCKING.


THE Splash continued on her course up the lake, after I had landed Bob
Hale. It was quite dark, and I told Kate she need not stay in the cuddy
any longer. She came out, and sat down near me. I was still in doubt as
to what I should do with her; and now that Bob had left me, the problem
seemed more difficult than before. Mrs. Loraine was not a woman to let
the matter rest where it was. She was full of spirit and vindictiveness,
and as she was the legal guardian of Kate, she would not let her escape
pass unnoticed.

In the morning, if not before, it would be discovered that the bird had
flown. After the interest Bob and I had manifested in the welfare of the
young lady, her guardian would know where to apply for information, and
I might expect to hear from her in the course of twenty-four hours, and
it was not improbable that the search would be commenced that very
evening. I told Kate, as we sailed along, that her absence would create
a tempest in the household of her step-mother, and that we must be
prepared for vigorous proceedings on her part.

"I hope I haven't got you into trouble, Ernest Thornton," said she, her
tones indicating much anxiety.

"Never mind me, Kate. I am used to trouble, and I can stand anything. I
only hope I shall be able to keep you safe from your enemies."

"Can't I stay in this boat? That cabin is a nice place; I am sure it
seems like a fairy palace to me, compared with my prison house in the
attic chamber."

"You might stay in the cabin a day or two; but of course you can't live
there for any great length of time. You say you have an uncle in New
York city."

"I have. If I could only find him I should be safe. I never saw him, at
least not since I can remember; but as he is my father's brother, he
must be something like my father, and he will take care of me."

"How can we get you to New York? That's the question."

"If I could only reach the railroad, I should not be afraid to go
alone," she added, earnestly. "I am sure I could find my uncle, for his
name is not a very common one."

"But I don't think it would be safe for you to go alone. We must manage
that some way or other, though I hardly know how. It will need some
money to pay your fare."

"Dear me! so it will!" exclaimed she, blankly. "And I haven't a single
cent!"

"Never mind, Kate; we will manage that. I can raise the money for you,
and see that you get to New York."

"You are very kind, Ernest Thornton," replied she, warmly. "I shall have
plenty of money some time, and will pay you back every cent."

"There will be no trouble about that," I added. "I am only thinking how
I shall get you safely to your destination; but I am going to do it
somehow or other. Are you not afraid to stay in the boat all night?"

"O, no! I'm not afraid of anything but my attic chamber."

"My cabin isn't a bad place to stay in. I have slept there a great many
nights, in all parts of the lake, sometimes miles from any house."

"I'm not a bit afraid, Ernest Thornton. Why, the cabin is a splendid
place, and there are two nice beds there. I'm sure I don't want any
better room than that. I could live there a whole year."

"You will not have to stay there long. Just as soon as I can get the
money, and find some one to go with you to New York, I shall sail up the
creek, where there is a railroad station, and you shall start for New
York. Now we are almost to the cottage of my uncle, and you had better
keep out of sight, for I don't want any one to see you."

She crawled into the cuddy, and sat down on one of the berths. I always
moored the Splash about ten rods from the shore, so that she could lie
in the deep water. The row-boat in which I came off to her was fastened
to the buoy, so that I easily found the place in the darkness, and made
fast to the moorings. I lowered my sails, and put every thing in order
as usual.

"Now, Kate, I think you will be perfectly safe here. I will bring you
off some supper very soon."

"I don't need any supper. Mrs. Loraine sent me some before she went out
to ride; but I could not eat a mouthful."

"No matter; I will bring off something, and see you again to-night."

I went ashore in the row-boat. My supper was waiting for me in the
dining-room. After I had finished the meal, I buttered several slices of
bread, and wrapped them in a napkin, with some cheese and some cake.
Probably old Betsey, the housekeeper, thought I had a ravenous appetite
that night; but she never asked any questions, or expressed any surprise
at anything which occurred at the cottage. I pulled off to the boat
again, and gave the contents of the napkin to Kate.

"I am sorry I can't light the lantern, Kate," I added, as I handed her
the provisions; "but I'm afraid it would betray you, if Mrs. Loraine
should happen to come here in search of you to-night."

"I don't care to have a light. I am so rejoiced to get away from my
prison that I don't care for anything," said she, with enthusiasm. "You
don't know how much I have suffered over there, Ernest Thornton."

"I hope you have seen the last of it; but we must be very careful. In
the morning you must stay in your cabin, for my uncle gets up very
early, and walks all about the place. You must not let him see you on
any account."

"I will not. I will be as careful as you can desire."

"In the morning I hope I shall be able to do something with you."

"I shall trust myself wholly to you, Ernest Thornton, and one of these
days I hope to be able to repay you for your goodness to me."

"Never mind that, Kate; I am going to do what I think is right because
it is right. I suppose you thought it was rather hard in me to take you
ashore at the pier over there, this afternoon; but I'm sure I shouldn't
have dared to do what I have done if I hadn't seen Mrs. Loraine, and
satisfied myself that she ill-treated you."

"I think you did just right, Ernest Thornton; but I was willing to
suffer rather than get you into trouble."

"I don't care for myself; it don't make much difference what happens to
me. If I can only enable you to reach your uncle in New York city, that
is all I want. But it is getting late now, and I think you had better go
to sleep. You can do as I do, Kate, when I sleep on board. I always lock
myself in."

I explained to her how this was done. There were two doors opening into
the cuddy, one on each side of the mainmast, with a slide over each.
Outside of these doors were two round holes, which I had sawed in the
bulkhead for ventilation. By reaching the arm through one of these
apertures the slide could be locked. I fastened Kate into the cuddy, and
then gave her the key, with which she opened the door without difficulty
