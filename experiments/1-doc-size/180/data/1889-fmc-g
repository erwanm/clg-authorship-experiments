hesitating whether to light a fresh cigar or not. 

' We might adjourn to your room,' suggested Rex. ' We can 
finish the night there/ 

There was a stir near the door, and Greif looked round, idly at 
first, to see what was the matter, then with an expression of 
dismay. A man had entered the hall, a man with a ghastly face, 
who seemed to be making inquiries of the knot of Korps servants 
who waited for their tardy masters. Greif's eyes fixed themselves 
in the anticipation of evil, when he saw that the fellow wore the 
Greifenstein livery and was one of his father's grooms. What was 
most strange was that he wore boots and spurs, as if he had ridden 
hard, though he could only have reached Schwarzburg by the rail way. 

' Karl ! ' cried Greif in a tone that made the man start. * What 
are you doing here ? ' 

Karl crossed the hall, his face growing paler than ever, and his 
teeth chattering. He had not had time to recover from the thought 
of what he had left behind him. His hands trembled violently as 
they grasped the military cap he held. 

' Herr Baron ' he stammered, staring at Greif with wide and 

frightened eyes. * Herr Baron -' he began again, trying to frame 
the words. 

' Speak, Karl ! ' exclaimed Greif making a desperate effort to 
seem calm, though he instinctively dreaded the words which must 
fall from the man's lips. 

The groom turned appealingly to Rex, who sat motionless in his 
place, scrutinising the messenger with his stony glance. 

'My God!' cried he. 'I cannot tell him! Sir, are you a 
friend of the Herr Baron ? ' 

Rex nodded, and laying one hand upon Greif's shoulder as 
though to make him keep his seat, rose and made a sign to the 
groom to follow him. But Greif would not submit to be treated 
like a child, and sprang up, seizing the man's arm and drawing 
him nearer. 

' I will hear it myself,' he said firmly. ' Is it my father ? ' he 
asked in uncertain tones. 



 

Karl nodded gravely. 

I caught the train as I jumped from the saddle,' he answered. 

' My mother sent you ? ' asked Greif anxiously. 

The groom shook his head, and his tremor increased, while he 
stared wildly about as though in search of some escape from his 
awful mission. 

' Speak, man ! ' cried Greif, mad with anxiety. ' My father is 
ill and you are here though my mother did not send you speak, 
I say.' 

' They are dead,' answered Karl in a low voice. 

Greif sank into his seat and covered his face. Suddenly Rex's 
impenetrable eyes flashed, and he, last of the three, turned white 
to the lips. 

' Is there another gentleman at Greifenstein ? ' he asked quickly. 

' He is also with them, sir.' 

'Dead?' 

' He shot himself.' 

Rex closed his eyes and held the table with his two hands, for 
he knew who the stranger had been. Seeing that Greif did not 
move, and supposing that Rex was a mere acquaintance, the man 
took courage to tell the story, speaking in a low voice to Rex. 

' The gentleman arrived before dinner,' he said. ' Their 
merciful lordships dined together, but the butler said they left the 
table before it was time. Then they heard firing in the house. 
We broke the doors and found the Lady Baroness dead, in the, 
room beyond the Herr Baron's study, and in the study the Herr 
Baron dead with a pistol in his hand, and the other gentleman 
dead with another pistol in his hand. I saw them. They had 
shot themselves as they sat in their chairs before the fire, but 
the fire was nearly gone out, though the lamp was burning. And 
then we saddled and rode, we four, one for the police, one for the 
doctor, one for Sigmundskron, and I for the railway, and here I 
am. You are a good friend of the young Herr, sir ? ' 

'Yes, that I am,' answered Rex, starting as though from sleep. 

' Then it would be best, sir, that you should tell me whither I 
should go, for the young Herr will be worse if he sees me.' 

'Ask your way to the Red Eagle Inn/ said Rex, 'and stay 
there till we send for you.' 

He gave the man a handful of loose coin, thoughtful of all 
contingencies, as he ever was. 

' You need not talk about this horrible catastrophe,' he said, as 
he dismissed the frightened groom. 

The latter disappeared as fast as he could, glad to get away 





 

from the sight of Greif's misery, and glad to have found some one 
to help him in telling his fearful tale. When he was gone Rex 
laid his hand upon Greif's shoulder, and spoke in a tone of quiet 
authority. 

' Come with me,' he said. Greif rose to his feet like a man in 
a dream, and allowed Rex to put on his topcoat for him, and to 
lead him out of the almost deserted hall, through the group of 
servants who loitered at the door and made way respectfully for 
the pair to pass. 

' Whither ? ' asked Greif as they stood in the cold street. 

' To your room,' answered Rex, quietly passing his arm through 
his friend's and gently urging him to move forward. 

Greif did not remember afterwards how he had found his way 
from the hall to his lodging. Neither he nor Rex spoke during 
the quarter of an hour they employed in reaching the street door, 
but Rex's arm was aching with the effort of sustaining and 
directing his companion. He lit a taper arid prepared to help him 
up the stairs. But the sight of the familiar entrance recalled 
Greif to himself and dissipated the first stupor of his grief. He 
ascended the steps firmly, though he went like a man overcome 
with fatigue, to whom every movement is difficult. Still silent, 
Rex lit the lamp in the small room, and began to help Greif to 
take off his mantle. But Greif pushed him aside gently and sat 
down as he was upon the well-worn chair. Rex went and sat 
.himself down in a corner at some distance and waited. His 
instinct told him that his friend must have time to recover from 
the first shock before anything could be done. He shaded his eyes 
from the light with one hand, and thought of his own sorrow. 

The silence was intense. It was as though the spirits of the 
dead, of the mother of both and of the father of each, were 
present in the commonplace chamber where sat their two sons, not 
knowing each other for brothers, though overwhelmed by the 
same calamity. It seemed as if the murdered woman and her 
dead murderers were standing silently in the midst of the small 
room, watching to see what should happen to those they had left 
behind. 

At last Greif raised his white face and looked towards Rex. 

' I must go,' he said simply. 

'Yes,' answered Rex. 'We must bury our dead.' 

Greif looked at him as though asking for an explanation of the 
words. He had not heard all the groom's story. 

' My father is also with them,' said Rex, answering the unspoken 
question. 



 

Greif grasped the table and stared at his companion stupidly 
for a moment. Then all at once his pale face grew luminous and 
his eyes glittered.
