'Then you are not going to scold me?' he asked at length, without 
releasing her.

'For what?'

'Bringing you into such perverse circumstances.'

Hazel looked at him wistfully. 'I knew how it would be,' she said. 'I 
knew myself. That was why I said no. At least, partly why.'

'Do you regret my action?'

'I was naughty enough yesterday morning to hope you would,' said 
Hazel with a confessing laugh.

'I told Prim just now, privately, that if we ever went that journey I 
spoke of, she should go too.'

The colour flushed up into Hazel's face, and went away again, but 
she gave neither word nor look.

'You are sorry?'

'Never ask such questions afterwards!' said Hazel. And she would 
have disengaged herself, but he would not let her. 'Do you not 
know better than that?'

'Hazel,' he said, gravely though full of tenderness,'you and I are 
not going to live to ourselves?'

Like a statue, so the girl stood; but with a rush of thoughts that for 
a minute she could not head off.

'He might live to mejust a little bit,' so they ran. 'That is what 
I shall do to him,under God,always!'Then tramp, tramp, 
came the words:

"The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the 
man,"and if ever in her life Wych Hazel felt rebellious, she did 
so then. The old grievance of man's right of way,the fact that it 
was a right,but with it a softer feeling, hurt and sore, that he 
could even wish for anybody else but her on such a journey; that 
her right should not have come in there.


"The moon looks down on many brooks,

"The brook can see no moon but one!"


He might at least have consulted her. Suppose she had asked 
somebody?Wych Hazel drew half of a very long sigh, choked 
the rest back, then raised her grave brown eyes, and answered,

'No.'

Did he see what was beneath them? For a peculiar fire leapt into 
the grey eyes. He spoke in the same tone he had used before.

'Suppose, Hazel, we lose twenty-five per cent. of our pleasure? 
And suppose Primrose gains a hundred?' He was holding her 
close and tenderly, looking down into her eyes with all the power 
of his.

'Well,' said Hazel,'I suppose she would.'

'And I suppose we should. I ask nobody for my pleasure to be a 
third with us. I suppose it will be a trial to me when we go home, 
to have Heinert at the dinner table and talking to me in the 
evening. And yet, Hazel, just because you are so much to me, I 
dare not but pour pleasure into every cup I see standing empty; 
even though I let a few drops of my own go.'

She answered softly 'Yes,'yet was very near adding, 'But you are 
spilling mine!'It was rather hard. Would he be always doing 
such things, over the head of her pleasure? But in the new life and 
purpose awake in her, Wych Hazel had found a new set of answers 
to trouble some questions. If the answers were also sometimes 
difficult, they were at least conclusive. And now, as she stood 
there, these words came: 

"For even Christ pleased not himself."

"Even,"what was she, to set up her pleasure against anybody's 
good? A quiver crept round her lips for a minutebut then she 
looked up and laughed.

'I am just as perverse as I can be, to-night,' she said. 'Stroked all 
the wrong way. That disposes of everything.'

Rollo bent and pressed his lips to those soft trembling ones, and 
still holding her fast, caressed face and hair with the free hand; his 
face shewing more delight in her than Hazel was in a condition to 
observe; though the tenderness of tone and touch spoke their own 
language.

'Hazel' he said softly.

She looked up, listening.

'I am curious about something.'

'I cannot say I shall be happy to gratify your curiosity, until I know 
what it is about.'

'It concerns the question, how you are going to ask my pardon for 
the thought that has been in your head?'

'I am not going to do it.'

'You ought. And you know that what you ought, you always, 
sooner or later,do.'

'Ought I?' said Wych Hazel. 'Is it one of your prerogatives to have 
your pardon asked without cause?' But then she laid her face 
against his, in a way that was extremely womanish and not a bit 
self-asserting.

Rollo stood still and added no more. He had read what was going 
on in her thoughts, and he knew that she was mistaken; but he also 
knew that words prove nothing, and as before, he waited. Only as 
at last he let her out of his arms, he said lightly,

'You will not lose anything in the long run, Hazel. People never 
do, by doing right.'


CHAPTER XXXI.

NOVICE WORK.


Mrs. Coles did not improve her position next day. 'What nights 
does Sacchi-s√ºssi sing?' she asked, when Rollo had left the three 
ladies alone. Hazel answered that she had not noticed.

'They say she is wonderful, and beautiful, and everything. Do you 
suppose Dane will take us, if we ask him nicely?'

'I do not go.'

'To the opera? My dear! Not at all?'

'Not at all.'

'But why?'

Wych Hazel stood thinking. She was very shy of declaring 
herselfyet sometimes it must be done.

'A few years ago,' she said slowly, 'when the war was going on, 
two gentlemen came one night to see Mr. Falkirk. They told war 
stories; and I with my book of some study in my hand, sat still and 
listened. One story was this. A mutual friend of all the parties had 
laid the United States flag down in her drawing room as a floor-
cloth, to be trodden under foot. Then the other gentleman spoke 
out and said his wife would not enter that house again while the 
war lasted! Mrs. Colesat the opera and the theatre my flag is 
under foot.'

'Your flag!' said the lady in amazement.

'Yes,' Hazel answered with her colour stirring. 'You know what 
service I have sworn into.'

'I don't see where the flags come in,' said Mrs. Coles.

Hazel answered softly, gazing into the fire,"Thou hast given a 
banner to thy chosen, that it may be displayed because of the 
truth."

'Then you mean to say,' broke out Mrs. Coles with a rising colour 
of her own tinging the pale face, 'that no Christians ever go to the 
theatre!'

'Do they carry their flag aloft there?' said Wych Hazel. 'Are they 
marching to victory under its folds? I could not carry mine. It 
would be trailing, drooping, union-down!'

'Prue, Prue,' said Primrose, 'you know what papa always says.'
