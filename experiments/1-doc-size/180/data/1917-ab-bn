in a brief surprise. " I don't want to run away." 

How could he run away and leave the question of his 
life unanswered, leave a silent Ellen too angry even to say 
good-by? 

" Well ! " said Larry. That was evidently not the way 
out. What other way was there? " I wish you'd go into 
Ardelia's," he said, at random, " and ask Ellen to fetch 
my bread." 

Hugh had risen to go. He stood there holding the top 
rail of a straight-backed chair and Larry saw his knuc- 
kles whiten and, needing to know the whole, ruthlessly 
lifted his gaze to the boy's face. It was as pale as if 
all the blood in him had been summoned to keep up his 
sick heart. Yet Hugh answered without emotion. 


" I can " said he. 

Then Larry knew, and answered cheerfully : 

" All right. I'll go up myself, this evening." 

Larry did go up, and, entering the yard softly, looked 
in at the window. Often, he knew, Ardelia left Ellen at 
her books and went neighboring at the Gleasons'. If 
Ardelia were here, he could not ask his question. Ellen 
was alone, sitting at the table, a pile of books before her 
and her pretty forehead tied into a studious frown. 
Larry called to her and then walked in, and she took his 
coming as a delightful happening and drew up another 
chair and told him to begin at once to scan her Latin. 
So he did, and they fell together into the rhythm, and 
sang it together and were most particularly happy, and 
Ellen's cheeks grew red with the fun of it and, for the min- 
ute, she forgot her father was not there. David hadn't 
known how to scan, but she always felt everything used 
to be easy when he was in the room, and this night, what 
with the snags she tripped over in her task, she had been 
minding his loss overwhelmingly. Larry raced through 
their pretty game in a scamper, for fear Ardelia would 
come before he did the deed he came for, and when they 
ended, he shut the book and asked : 

" Ellen, don't you speak to Hugh? " 

All the enchanting shine and life faded out of her face, 
and she answered with dignity, yet, Larry saw, sul- 
lenly : 

" No." 

" Why not? " asked Larry. 

And Ellen was as silent as she had been to Hugh. 
Larry leaned back in his chair and, while he looked at her, 
he drummed on the table with his hand, a distinctively 
handsome hand that played the violin. 

" Now," said he, " my lady, you needn't get sulky with 



 

me, because if you do, I'll take you up in my two hands 
and throw you over the moon." 

Ellen didn't look at him ; but he saw a little quirk of a 
smile trying to untie the muscles about her mouth, and 
he felt he had her. Besides, Ellen knew she was quite 
safe with him. He wouldn't touch her high mightiness 
with his two beautiful violin-playing hands. 

" Ellen," said Larry, drumming on the table, " you are 
a little prig." 

" What's a prig? " asked Ellen. 

" It's something with two feet and two hands and nice 
brown hair tied with a red ribbon." (Ellen had stopped 
doing up her hair when school began, because the girls 
laughed at her.) " It's something that gets mad and 
self-righteous if a boy wants to kiss 'em — " 

" I hate such things," flashed Ellen. 

" Well, but, my child," said Larry, gently, just as her 
father would have spoken, and Ellen thought of that, 
and choked, "if it's a decent chap like Hugh it only 
means your hair is so pretty and your eyes are so bright 
and you're such a dear — like a kitten, you know, or one 
of Smilie's puppies — he can't help it." 

Ellen did, in spite of her anchorite heart, like to be 
thought pretty, and was sure she never could be because 
her clothes were so plain. 

" You'd like to kiss Smilie's puppies. I've seen you do 
it. How would you like if it Smilie and I wouldn't speak 
to you? " 

"I suppose you want me to act like — " Here she 
stopped, not intending to be hateful about another girl. 
But he knew. 

" Like Grissie Gleason? " he asked. " No, I don't want 
you to be like her. Though there's no harm in Grissie. 
She's a butterfly in the sun. She'd go fluttering round 



 

with any kind of a butterfly, if his wings were pretty. 
But that wouldn't mean she was a bad Grissie. Don't 
you get to despising people, Ellen, because they're not so 
good as you." 

Ellen was looking at him woefully, and startled in a 
way that made him ask her: 

"What is it now?" 

" If it's all — like that," faltered Ellen, " it's dread- 
ful." 

He saw what he had done. He had opened to her a 
way of the world. Why hadn't she the kind of mother, 
his mind despairingly lamented, that would take her hand 
firmly and lead her out of this ambuscade of ignorance? 
He went at it with a run. " Ellen," he said, " first and 
last there's no such glorious ajid dreadful thing as falling 
in love, and wanting to marry, or diaybe not marrying 
because sometimes you don't love the right one. But 
there's a side of us that makes us go uneasily seeking 
about after our mate, if we haven't got one, and we make 
awful fools of ourselves. Boys and girls don't know they 
want a mate — mostly — but they do silly things. Like 
Grissie. And mostly the things aren't big enough to de- 
spise bhem for and stop speaking. Sometimes, I know, 
they are and then you have to knock 'em down with a 
cordwood stick and never, never speak to 'em till they're 
well punished. But Hugh, Ellen! Hugh's only a big, 
blundering boy, and you're behaving like the deuce." 

Ellen wasn't thinking of Hugh. Her brows were heavy 
with an unhappy fear. It looked to him like jealousy. 

" You said everybody goes round hunting after his 
mate," she said. " I suppose you mean men. You 
haven't any mate." 

" Good God, no ! " said Larry. He would lay that 
jealous imp to rest. " I don't want any mate. I just 



 

want your mother to make my bread and you to fetch it 
to me. But I did want a mate, Ellen, once, and if I told 
you how old and fat she is now and how I love one of 
Smilie's wags better than the lost dream of her, you'd be 
terribly shocked at the whole business. But you speak to 
Hugh. He's worked out his sentence, don't you see? 
Tell him he's discharged." 

He got up and took his cap, but Ellen did not stir. 
Her eyes followed him to the door. 

" I suppose he's been tattling to you," she said, but not 
until his hand was on the latch. 

" No, you don't suppose any such thing," said Larry. 
"You know he hasn't. I saw him that day in the 
woods, and he didn't even want to kiss you, poor devil! 
and he wasn't fighting you. He was fighting himself and
