dripping roses overhead, the balmy humidity of every breath she drew?
What in her present companion that reminded her of the loving clasp that
had thrilled her heart into palpitation? the earnest depth of the eyes
that held hers during the one sharp, yet sweet moment of parting--eyes
that pledged the fealty of her lover’s soul, and demanded hers then and
forever? His conscience might have been sullied by crimes more heinous
than those charged upon him by her brother and his friends; he might--he
HAD--let her go easily, as one resigns his careless hold upon a
paltry, unprized toy; but when her hand had rested thus in his, and
his passionate regards penetrated her soul, he loved her, alone and
entirely! She would fold this conviction to her torpid heart for a
little while before she turned herself away finally from the memories
of that love-summer and battle-autumn of her existence. If it aroused
in the chilled thing some slight pangs of sentiency, it would do her no
hurt to realize through these that it had once been alive.

She saw a shadow approaching to join itself to hers upon the whitened
floor without, before Mr. Dorrance interrupted her reverie by words.

“The fury of the tempest you admire proves its paternity,” he said, with
a manifest effort at lightness. “It emanates from the vast magazines of
frost, snow, and wintry wind that lie far to the north-east even of my
home, and THAT is in a region you would think drear and inhospitable
after the more clement airs of of your native State.”

“We have very cold weather in Virginia sometimes,” returned Mabel, still
scanning the sentinel gate-posts, and the pyramidal arbor-vitae trees
flanking them.

Her gaze was a mournful farewell, but she neglected none of the
amenities of hospitality. She was used to talking commonplaces.

“We feel it all the more, too, on account of the mildness of the greater
part of the winter,” she subjoined.

“Allow me!” said the other, looping back the curtain she had until now
held in her hand. “Whereas our systems are braced by a more uniform
temperature to endure the severity of our frosts, and high, keen
blasts.”

“I suppose so,” assented Mabel, mechanically, and unconscious as himself
that meaning glances were stolen at them from the fireside circle, while
the hum and conversation was continuous and louder, for the good-natured
intent on the speakers’ part to afford the supposed lovers the chance of
carrying on their dialogue unheard.

“But our houses are very comfortable--often very beautiful,” Mr.
Dorrance persevered, keeping to the scent of his game, as a trained
pointer scours a stubble-field, narrowing his beat at every circuit;
“and the hearts of those who live in them are warm and constant. It is
not always true that

    “‘The cold in clime are cold in blood;
     Their love can scarce deserve the name.

“I have thought sometimes that that feeling is strongest and most
enduring, the demonstration of which is guarded and infrequent, as the
deepest portion of the channel is the most quiet.”

If his philosophical and scientific talk were heavy and solid, his
poetry and metaphors were ponderous and labored. Yet Mabel listened to
him now, neither facing nor avoiding him, looking down at her hands,
laid, one above the other, upon the window-sill, the image of maidenly
and courteous attention.

Why should she affect diffidence, or seek to escape what she had
foreseen for weeks, and made no effort to ward off? She had come to the
conclusion in October that Herbert Dorrance would, when the forms he
considered indispensable to regular courtship had been gone through
with, ask her to marry him, and coolly taken her resolution to accept
him. This morning, on the reception of a handsome Christmas gift from
him, and discovering in his actions something more pointed than his
customary punctilious devoirs, and in his didacticism the outermost of
the closing circle of pursuit she had furthermore concluded that his
happy thought was to celebrate the festal season by his betrothment. She
was quite ready for the declaration, which, she anticipated, would be
pompous and formal. She would have excused him from “doing” the poetical
part of it; but, since it was on the programme, it was not her province
to interfere.

“I am no enthusiast,” he next averred,--Rosa would have said, very
unnecessarily--“the tricks of sighing lovers are beyond--or beneath--my
imitation. I could not ‘write a sonnet to my mistress’ eyebrow,’ or
move her to tearful pity by sounding declarations of my adoration of
her peerless charms, and my anguish at the bare imagination of the
possibility that these would ever be another’s. But, so far as the
earnest affection and sincere esteem of an honest man can satisfy the
requirements of a good woman’s heart, yours shall be filled, Mabel,
if you will be my wife. I have admired you from the first day of our
meeting. For six months I have been truly attached to you, and seriously
meditated this declaration. Your brother is satisfied with the exhibit I
have made of my affairs and my prospects, and sanctions my addresses.
I can maintain you more than comfortably, and it shall be one of the
principal aims of my life to consult your welfare in all my plans for my
own advancement. I have been settled in the large and flourishing
city of Albany about seven years, and--ignoring the trammels of mock
humility, let me say to you--have, within that period, gained to a
flattering extent the confidence of the most respectable portion of the
community; have built up an excellent and growing business connection,
and secured the entree of the best society there. These are the
pecuniary and social aspects of the alliance I propose for your
consideration. Through my sister, and by means of the intimate
association into which her marriage with your brother has drawn you and
myself, you have been enabled, within the twelvemonth that has elapsed
since our introduction, one to the other, to learn whatever you wished
to know with respect to my personal character, my tastes, temper, and
habits. It has given me heartfelt pleasure to discover that these
are, in the main, analogous to your own. I have built upon this
similarity--or harmony would be the better word--sanguine hopes of our
future happiness, should you see your way clear to accept my proffered
hand, consent to link your future with mine.”

“I beg to lay the ‘ouse in Walcot Square, the business and myself,
before Miss Summerson, for her acceptance,” said magnanimous Mr. Guppy,
thus clinching his declaration that “the image he had supposed was
eradicated from his ‘art was NOT eradicated.”

It was more in keeping with Rosa’s character than Mabel’s to recollect
the comic scene in the book they had read together lately, but the
latter did remember it at this instant, and despite the momentous issues
involved in her immediate action, was strongly tempted to laugh in her
wooer’s solemn face.

Then--so abrupt and fearful are the transitions from the extremes of one
emotion to another--arose before her another picture. As in a
dissolving view, she beheld herself walking with Frederic Chilton in
the moonlighted alleys of the garden; midsummer flowers blooming to the
right and left, her head drooping, in shy happiness, as the lily-bell
bows to shed its freight of dew; his face glowing with the ardor
of verbal confession of that he had already sought to express by
letter--heard his fervent, pleading murmur, “Mabel! look up, my darling!
and tell me again that you will not send me away beggared and starving.
I cannot yet believe in the reality of my bliss!”

These were the love-words of an “enthusiast”--these---

The vision vanished at the short, hard breath, she drew in unclasping
her locked hands, and lifting her grave, tranquil eyes to the level of
her suitor’s.

“I will follow your example in repudiating spurious sentiment, Mr.
Dorrance. I believe you to be a good, true man and that the attachment
you profess for me is sincere. I believe, moreover, that my chances of
securing real peace of mind will be fairer, should I commit myself to
your guardianship, than if I were to surrender my affections to the
keeping of one whose vows were more impassioned, who, professing to
adore me as a divinity, should yet be destitute of your high moral
principle and stainless honor. When I was younger and more rash in
judgment and feeling, I was led into a sad mistake by the evidence of
eye, ear, and a girl’s imagination. I ought to tell you this, if you
have not already heard the story. I will not deceive you into the
persuasion that I can ever feel for you, or any other man, the love,
or what I thought was love, I knew in the few brief weeks of my early
betrothal. But you must know how that ended, and I have no desire to
repeat the mad experiment of risking my earthly all upon one throw of
fate. If friendship--if esteem, and the resolve to show myself a worthy
recipient of your generous confidence--will content you, all else shall
be as you wish.”

In her determination to be candid, to leave him in no uncertainty as to
her actual sentiments, she had concerted a response but a degree less
stilted than his proposal. She would have been ashamed of it had he
appeared less gratified.

His dull eyes brightened; his face flushed and beamed with unfeigned
delight, and in his transport he said the most natural and graceful
thing that ever escaped him during his wooing.

“I am content! The second love of Mabel Aylett must ever be more to me
than the first of any other woman!”

True, he nearly spoiled all the next minute, by producing from his
pocket a wee velvet case, from which he extracted a valuable diamond
ring, and proceeded, then and there, in the shadow of the accommodating
curtain, to fit it upon her finger. He had foreseen that she would not
be hardly won, and with characteristic providence had prepared himself
for the event.

The blood leaped to Mabel’s temples and the fire to her eye, at the
prompt seal set by the practical non-enthusiast upon the contract, but
