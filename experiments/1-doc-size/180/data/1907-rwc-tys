art-nouveau rocking-chair."

"A perfect sample of man's gratitude," said Nina, exasperated; "for I've
ordered two beautiful art-nouveau rocking-chairs, one for you and one
for Mr. Lansing. Now you can go and humiliate poor little Eileen, who
took so much pleasure in planning with me for your comfort. As for your
friend Boots, he's unspeakable--with my compliments."

Selwyn stayed until he made peace with his sister, then he mounted to
the nursery to "lean over" the younger children and preside at prayers.
This being accomplished, he descended to the library, where Eileen
Erroll in a filmy, lace-clouded gown, full of turquoise tints, reclined
with her arm around Drina amid heaps of cushions, watching the waitress
prepare a table for two.

He took the fresh, cool hand she extended and sat down on the edge of
her couch.

"All O.K. again?" he inquired, retaining Eileen's hand in his.

"Thank you--quite. Are you really going to dine with us? Are you sure
you want to? Oh, I know you've given up some very gay dinner
somewhere--"

"I was going to dine with Boots when Nina rescued me. Poor Boots!--I
think I'll telephone--"

"Telephone him to come here!" begged Drina. "Would he come? Oh,
please--I'd love to have him."

"I wish you would ask him," said Eileen; "it's been so lonely and stupid
to lie in bed with a red nose and fishy eyes and pains in one's back and
limbs. Please do let us have a party."



So Selwyn went to the telephone, and presently returned, saying that
Boots was overwhelmed and would be present at the festivities; and
Drina, enraptured, ordered flowers to be brought from the dining-room
and a large table set for four, with particular pomp and circumstance.

Mr. Archibald Lansing arrived very promptly--a short, stocky young man
of clean and powerful build, with dark, keen eyes always alert, and
humorous lips ever on the edge of laughter under his dark moustache.

His manner with Drina was always delightful--a mixture of self-repressed
idolatry and busily na√Øve belief in a thorough understanding between
them to exclude Selwyn from their company.

"This Selwyn fellow here!" he exclaimed. "I warned him over the 'phone
we'd not tolerate him, Drina. I explained to him very carefully that you
and I were dining together in strictest privacy--"

"He begged so hard," said Eileen. "Will somebody place an extra pillow
for Drina?"

They seized the same pillow fiercely, confronting each other; massacre
appeared imminent.

"Two pillows," said Drina sweetly; and extermination was averted. The
child laughed happily, covering one of Boots's hands with both of hers.

"So you've left the service, Mr. Lansing?" began Eileen, lying back and
looking smilingly at Boots.

"Had to, Miss Erroll. Seven millionaires ran into my quarters and chased
me out and down Broadway into the offices of the Westchester Air Line
Company. Then these seven merciless multi-millionaires in buckram bound
and gagged me, stuffed my pockets full of salary, and forced me to
typewrite a fearful and secret oath to serve them for five long, weary
years. That's a sample of how the wealthy grind the noses of the poor,
isn't it, Drina?"

The child slipped her hand from his, smiling uncertainly.

"You don't mean all that, do you?"

"Indeed I do, sweetheart."

"Are you not a soldier lieutenant any more, then?" she inquired,
horribly disappointed.

"Only a private in the workman's battalion, Drina."

"I don't care," retorted the child obstinately; "I like you just as
much."

"Have you really done it?" asked Selwyn as the first course was served.

"I? No. They? Yes. We'll probably lose the Philippines now," he
added gloomily; "but it's my thankless country's fault; you all had a
chance to make me dictator, you know. Miss Erroll, do you want a
second-hand sword? Of course there are great dents in it--"

"I'd rather have those celebrated boots," she replied demurely; and Mr.
Lansing groaned.

"How tall you're growing, Drina," remarked Selwyn.

"Probably the early spring weather," added Boots. "You're twelve, aren't
you?"

"Thirteen," said Drina gravely.

"Almost time to elope with me," nodded Boots.

"I'll do it now," she said--"as soon as my new gowns are made--if you'll
take me to Manila. Will you? I believe my Aunt Alixe is there--"

She caught Eileen's eye and stopped short. "I forgot," she murmured; "I
beg your pardon, Uncle Philip--"

Boots was talking very fast and laughing a great deal; Eileen's plate
claimed her undivided attention; Selwyn quietly finished his claret; the
child looked at them all.

"By the way," said Boots abruptly, "what's the matter with Gerald? He
came in before noon looking very seedy--" Selwyn glanced up quietly.

"Wasn't he at the office?" asked Eileen anxiously.

"Oh, yes," replied Selwyn; "he felt a trifle under the weather, so I
sent him home."

"Is it the grippe?"

"N-no, I believe not--"

"Do you think he had better have a doctor? Where is he?"

"He was here," observed Drina composedly, "and father was angry with
him."

"What?" exclaimed Eileen. "When?"

"This morning, before father went downtown."

Both Selwyn and Lansing cut in coolly, dismissing the matter with a
careless word or two; and coffee was served--cambric tea in Drina's
case.

"Come on," said Boots, slipping a bride-rose into Drina's curls; "I'm
ready for confidences."

"Confidences" had become an established custom with Drina and Boots; it
meant that every time they saw one another they were pledged to tell
each other everything that had occurred in their lives since their last
meeting.

So Drina, excitedly requesting to be excused, jumped up and, taking
Lansing's hand in hers, led him to a sofa in a distant corner, where
they immediately installed themselves and began an earnest and whispered
exchange of confidences, punctuated by little whirlwinds of laughter
from the child.

Eileen settled deeper among her pillows as the table was removed, and
Selwyn drew his chair forward.

"Suppose," she said, looking thoughtfully at him, "that you and I make a
vow to exchange confidences? Shall we, Captain Selwyn?"

"Good heavens," he protested; "I--confess to you! You'd faint dead
away, Eileen."

"Perhaps. . . . But will you?"

He gaily evaded an answer, and after a while he fancied she had
forgotten. They spoke of other things, of her convalescence, of the
engagements she had been obliged to cancel, of the stupid hours in her
room--doubly stupid, as the doctor had not permitted her to read or sew.

"And every day violets from you," she said; "it was certainly nice of
you. And--do you know that somehow--just because you have never yet
failed me--I thought perhaps--when I asked your confidence a moment
ago--"

He looked up quickly.

"What is the matter with Gerald?" she asked. "Could you tell me?"
