stuck out of you!”

“You mean I floundered like a drowning man----?”

Well, she consented to have meant that. “Till I plunged in!”

He appeared there for a few seconds, to see her again take the jump
and to listen again to the splash; then, with an odd, sharp impulse,
he turned his back. “You saved me.”

She wouldn’t deny it--on the contrary. “What a pity, now, I
haven’t a daughter!”

On this he slowly came round again. “What should I do with her?”

“You’d treat her, I hope, better than you’ve treated Miss
Prodmore.”

The young man positively coloured. “But I haven’t been bad----?”

The sight of this effect of her small joke produced on Mrs.
Gracedew’s part an emotion less controllable than any she had
yet felt. “Oh, you delightful goose!” she irrepressibly dropped.

She made his blush deepen, but the aggravation was a relief. “Of
course--I’m all right, and there’s only one pity in the
matter. I’ve nothing--nothing whatever, not a scrap of service nor a
thing you’d care for--to offer you in compensation.”

She looked at him ever so kindly. “I’m not, as they say, ‘on
the make.’” Never had he been put right with a lighter hand. “I
didn’t do it for payment.”

“Then what did you do it for?”

For something, it might have seemed, as her eyes dropped and strayed,
that had got brushed into a crevice of the old pavement. “Because I
hated Mr. Prodmore.”

He conscientiously demurred. “So much as all that?”

“Oh, well,” she replied impatiently, “of course you also know how
much I like the house. My hates and my likes,” she subtly explained,
“can never live together. I get one of them out. The one this time
was that man.”

He showed a candour of interest. “Yes--you got him out. Yes--I saw
him go.” And his inner vision appeared to attend for some moments
Mr. Prodmore’s departure. “But how did you do it?”

“Oh, I don’t know. Women----!” Mrs. Gracedew but vaguely sketched
it.

A touch or two, however, for that subject, could of course almost
always suffice. “Precisely--women. May I smoke again?” Clement Yule
abruptly asked.

“Certainly. But I managed Mr. Prodmore,” she laughed as he
re-lighted, “without cigarettes.”

Her companion puffed. “I couldn’t manage him.”

“So I saw!”

“I couldn’t get him out.”

“So he saw!”

Captain Yule, for a little, lost himself in his smoke. “Where is he
gone?”

“I haven’t the least idea. But I meet him again,” she hastened to
add--“very soon.”

“And when do you meet me?”

“Why, whenever you’ll come to see me.” For the twentieth time
she gathered herself as if the words she had just spoken were quite her
last hand. “At present, you see, I have a train to catch.”

Absorbed in the trivial act that engaged him, he gave her no help. “A
train?”

“Surely. I didn’t walk.”

“No; but even trains----!” His eyes clung to her now. “You
fly?”

“I try to. Good-bye.”

He had got between her and the door of departure quite as, on her
attempt to quit him half an hour before, he had anticipated her
approach to the stairs; and in this position he took no notice of her
farewell. “I said just now that I had nothing to offer you. But of
course I’ve the house itself.”

“The house?” She stared. “Why, I’ve got it?”

“Got it?”

“All in my head, I mean. That’s all I want.” She had not yet,
save to Mr. Prodmore, made quite so light of it.

This had its action in his markedly longer face. “Why, I thought you
loved it so!”

Ah, she was perfectly consistent. “I love it far too much to deprive
you of it.”

Yet Clement Yule could in a fashion meet her. “Oh, it wouldn’t be
depriving----!”

She altogether protested. “Not to turn you out----?”

“Dear lady, I’ve never been in!”

Oh, she was none the less downright. “You’re in now--I’ve put
you, and you must stay.” He looked round so woefully, however, that
she presently attenuated. “I don’t mean all the while, but long
enough----!”

“Long enough for what?”

“For me to feel you’re here.”

“And how long will that take?”

“Well, you think me very fast--but sometimes I’m slow. I told
you just now, at any rate,” she went on, “that I had arranged you
should lose nothing. Is the very next thing I do, then, to make you
lose everything?”

“It isn’t a question of what I lose,” the young man anxiously
cried; “it’s a question of what I do! What have I done to
find it all so plain?” Fate was really--fate reversed, improved, and
unnatural--too much for him, and his heated young face showed honest
stupefaction. “I haven’t lifted a finger. It’s you who have done
all.”

“Yes, but if you’re just where you were before, how in the world
are you saved?” She put it to him with still superior lucidity.

“By my life’s being my own again--to do what I want.”

“What you ‘want’”--Mrs. Gracedew’s handsome uplifted head had
it all there, every inch of it--“is to keep your house.”

“Ah, but only,” he perfectly assented, “if, as you said, you find
a way!”

“I have found a way--and there the way is: for me just simply not
to touch the place. What you ‘want,’” she argued more closely,
“is what made you give in to Prodmore. What you ‘want’ is these
walls and these acres. What you ‘want’ is to take the way I first
showed you.”

Her companion’s eyes, quitting for the purpose her face, looked
to the quarter marked by her last words as at an horizon now
remote. “Why, the way you first showed me was to marry Cora!”

She had to admit it, but as little as possible. “Practically--yes.”

“Well, it’s just ‘practically’ that I can’t!”

“I didn’t know that then,” said Mrs. Gracedew. “You didn’t
tell me.”

He passed, with an approach to a grimace, his hand over the back of his
head. “I felt a delicacy!”

“I didn’t even know that.” She spoke it almost sadly.

“It didn’t strike you that I might?”

She thought a moment. “No.” She thought again. “No. But don’t
quarrel with me about it now!”

“Quarrel with you?” he looked amazement.

She laughed, but she had changed colour. “Cora, at any rate, felt no
