" I will not," said Lawry, firmly, as he dried his 
tears, " The boat is engaged to Mr. Sherwood, and 
he has invited a party to go with him. They were 
to start at nine o'clock, and they will be down here 
soon," 

" Can't help it. I promised to take Taylor and 
his friends out, and they are all here now. There 
are the stores for his party," replied Ben, as a 
couple of mea brought a large basket on board, from 
the top of which protruded the necks of a demijohn 
and several bottles. 

" I shall not go with that party," added Lawry, 
decidedly; and the "stores" which came on board 
assured him what kind of a time the passengers 
would have. 

" But I want a pilot," said Ben, whose plans were 
entirely defeated by the refusal of Lawry, for there 



 

was not another person, within ten miles of the spot, 
who was competent to navigate the Woodville. 

"What's the trouble, Wilf or d ? " demanded Tay- 
lor, approaching the spot. 

" Let me tell him you will go, Lawry ? " whispered 
Ben. " He may be hard on you if you don't." 

" I will not go. I must see Mr. Sherwood at 
once ; " and the pilot hastened down from the wheel- 
house. 

" What's the matter ? " asked Ethan, to whom a 
rumor of what had happened had come. 

Lawry was explaining what had occurred, when 
Ben came down with Taylor. 

" I shall not go in her till I have seen Mr. Sher- 
wood," added Lawry, as he finished his brief state- 
ment. 

" Then I shall not," replied Ethan. 

" I can steer her myself," said Ben to Taylor. 

" Certainly you can." 

" Mr. Sherwood will be down soon, and we must 
be off before he gets here." 

" Go up, arid start her then," added Taylor. 
Without noticing Lawry and Ethan, Ben rushed 




 

up to the wheel-house, and ordered the deck hands 
to cast off the fasts, which was done. He knew how 
to steer a boat, and understood the bells, having had 
considerable experience on board the large steamers. 
He rang to back her, supposing Ethan was at his 
post in the engine-room. 

She did not back, and he rang again, but with no 
better success than before. 

" Back her ! " shouted he, through the speaking- 
tube. 

There was no answer; and, filled with anger, the 
new captain rushed down to the engine-room to 
" blow up " the engineer. He found Ethan on the 
main deck. 

" What are you doing there ? " demanded Ben- 
" Don't you hear the bells ? " 

" I heard them," replied Ethan, quietly. 
" Why don't you start her, then ? " 
" I've nothing to do with her." 
"Don't you run that engine ? " 
"I don't." 

" What do you mean ? " 

" I mean that I will have nothing to do with the 
engine as things are now." 



 

Ben raved and stormed at Ethan ; then he tried 
to coax him to take his place ; but the engineer was 
as firm as the pilot had been. Taylor offered him 
ten dollars if he would run the engine that day ; 
but he positively refused. The new captain then 
went down to the fire-room, where the man in charge 
of the furnaces was promoted to the position of 
engineer. 

" Now we can go it," said Ben, as he hurried back 
to the wheel-house. 

" No ; don't start her," said the sherifi*, who was 
one of the party. 

" Why not ? " 

"I am responsible for the safety of this boat, 
and she shall not go with neither pilot nor engineer." 

Taylor and the new captain swore terribly ; but the 
sheriff was immovable. 



 



CHAPTER XVI. 

THE EXCTJRSION TO WHITEHALL. 

Lawey was no lawyer, and was therefore unable 
to form an opinion in regard to the legality of the 
steps by which the Woodville had been taken from 
him. It was an accomplished fact, and he was as 
disconsolate as though he had lost his best friend. 
He went on shore, and until the peremptory order 
of the sheriff was given, he expected to see the 
steamer shoot out from the wharf, and disappear 
beyond the point, in charge of another person than 
himself. 

He had refused to pilot the steamer under the 
new order of things, not becaiise he wished to be 
spiteful to his brother, but because he was smarting 
under a sense of injustice, which unfitted him for 
the duty. Though he did not comprehend the legal 
measures which had been taken, he felt that there 



 

was something wrong. The Woodville belonged to 
him, not to bis father ; and though he was willing to 
give all his earnings for the support of the family, 
and even to pay off the mortgage on the place, he 
felt that it was not right to take the steamer from 
him. 

He stood on the wharf, paralyzed by the calamity 
which had overtaken him. He wanted to do some- 
thing, but he did not know what to do. The sheriff, 
by his caution, had defeated the plans of the new 
captain, and Lawry was waiting to see what would 
happen next. He wished to see Mr. Sherwood, and 
he would have hastened up to his house if he could 
have endured the thought of losing sight of the 
steamer even for a moment. Ethan was still on 
deck, for though he refused to run the engine, he 
felt it to be his duty to stand by and see that no 
accident happened, for the steam was up, and the 
fireman was an unskilful person. 

Ben Wilford and Taylor were disappointed and 
chagrined at their failure to get off. They stormed 
and swore, till it was apparent that storming and
