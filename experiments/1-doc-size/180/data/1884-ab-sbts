CHAPTER XXVII. 

THE early train to Stratford took Elizabeth with 
it, flying to cover where she could at least hide 
her wounds. Oswald had gone out early, without see- 
ing her. She heard his step pass the library where she 
had lain all night, too negligent of herself to change 
her position, and where the morning light found her 
stiff and cramped. As soon as the door closed behind 
him, she ran up to her dressing-room, made her toilet 
and went down to breakfast. It was unnecessary to 
interest the servants in the fact that something unusual 
had happened. So she gave an order for Oswald's 
lunch, and told Ward she might be away some little time. 
Writing on a sheet of paper, " I have gone to Strat- 
ford," she left it in a sealed envelope on her husband's 
table. There was no need of reproaches or tragic 
farewells. Besides, she did not even know whether her 
present step was a final one or not, her only clear de- 
cision being that she must have rest and quiet, away 
from him. Her preparations made, she hurried away, 
with a feverish joy in action. How could she breathe, 
even, until miles lay between her and the place where 
she had been so wronged ! Pride had no part in her 
great suffering. Gossip and prying eyes in Stratford 
seemed far less to bear than this mockery of attempting 
a duty where none existed. As she stepped from the 
car at Sto\ve, Si's face was the first to greet her. 



 

" Lord ! do they do it as quick as this ! ' was his 
awe-struck exclamation. ' I ain't spoke to the girl 
even ! ' 

Elizabeth bowed and smiled, and was about passing 
him, when Si placed himself in her way and went on, 
'Your mother sent me up here to telegraft." 

" What ? ' :l said Elizabeth, a quick fear shooting into 
life. " What has happened ? " 

" Philip. He ain't very well. They thought you'd 
better come," answered Si, with the brevity that comes 
of evasion. ;< I've got the Sea View buggy. Climb 
right in." 

So Elizabeth, alive with the instinct of haste, entered 
the demoralized vehicle. 

'You must tell me just what it is," she said, when 
they were fairly on their rattling way. ' Don't try to 
make me more comfortable by deceiving me." 

'The doctor says it's only pneumony," said Si, 
soothingly, using the whip with emphasis. ' You see, 
Philip's acted like a crazed one, lately. He got a 
master cold coughin' and barkin' round for a week, he 
was and then he took to staying out doors and hanging
round the shore till he got powerful bad. An' I guess 
he had a hard row to fetch his breath last night." 

Elizabeth's came in one quick sob ; all other sorrow 
was effaced, and nothing seemed real and vital but her 
old devotion to Philip, as it had been when there was no 
paramount affection to overshadow it. Her life re- 
bounded a year, to the absorption of old ties. 

Mrs. Nye, like most women who endure and are 
patient, was a marvel of self-possession in illness. The 
habit of silence helped her there. But the unexpected 





sight of Elizabeth broke up her calmness ; her face 
changed, convulsively. 

" How is he, mother ? ' whispered Elizabeth, when 
they could both speak. 

;< Bad, very bad. You mustn't expect any thing." 
The girl felt her heart die within her at the hopeless 
tone. Taking off her hat, she went in to see him, and 
Philip, painfully struggling for breath, was at once 
radiant. A slight quiver passed over Grandmother's 
face. Older, her countenance more deeply lined, she 
sat by the bedside, slowly waving a large palm-leaf 
fan. She gave her place to Elizabeth, and the day's 
watching went on. Philip was not quite himself. The 
suffocation of the disease so oppressed him that he 
could not waste effort in speech or looks. Once he 
whispered, painfully, ( Betty, my play is almost ready. 
Could you finish copying it ?" 

'Yes, dear," said Elizabeth, feeling her own throat 
aching with the tears that must not come. 

The story of a sickness to death is always the same 
in substance, and need never be told. Philip died 
that night in an agony of struggle. 

When it was over, and they looked into one another's 
eyes across the bed, the supreme cup of solemn grief 
seemed to have touched their lips. Elizabeth had 
suffered keenly, but how was that rage of jealous 
anger to affect her life like this sweet and solemn 
mystery ? We step out of our earthly garments in the 
presence of death, and make holy resolves to live hence- 
forth in the shadow of its wonder. 

In her first calm moment, she repented that she had 
not meant to stay with her husband and be at her best, 



 

in spite of the worst circumstances. How, she did not 
know, but great things seem easy at great moments. 
That lesson of tenderness taught always by the dead 
prompted her to telegraph Oswald at once. 

" Philip is dead. Will you come ? ' 

Perhaps he would think she had been called home 
by the event ; it might be better so. She was sorcy 
for even the just resentment of her life. 

There were neighbors in the kitchen when Philip 
died, sitting like mute statues of country life, now 
and then exchanging a subdued whisper. That was a 
custom in Stratford. . It was the custom, too, at such 
times, to throng the room of the dying, watching the 
failing breath with mournful interest. But Elizabeth 
had steadily kept them out. Nobody should enter 
that inner circle who had not the right of love. 

It was Mrs. Nye who first remembered to rise from 
the watch no longer needed. 

' Grandmother," Elizabeth said in a whisper, touch- 
ing her shoulder. :< Come." 

The old lady looked up with a face carrying dread 
to the two who had never before seen it moved, except 
by anger. 

: Thirty years ago," she said, in a moaning voice, 
" Jeremiah died, and it's all brought back again." 

Elizabeth led her away with a tenderness she did not 
resent, perhaps because she saw nothing but shadows 
from the past and heard only the echoes of their 
voices. 


Sha'n't we send for Mr. Kewe ? ' asked Mrs. Nye, 
when preparations were being made for the funeral. 
;< I think not, mother. He is very busy." 




Oswald neither came nor wrote. There was much 
" thinking strange " of it in Stratford. People augured 
ill for Elizabeth's happiness. Grandmother asked no 
questions, and Mrs. Nye was roused to interest by no 
earthly circumstance. She seemed stricken, and lean- 
ed heavily on Elizabeth, who, it mercifully happened, 
had to think constantly of others.
