hand upon squares of gray and green. In self- 
defence he said so. 




" Whatever responsibilities," said Perley, with 
a slight twitch of annoyance between her eyes, 
and speaking still to the elder gentleman, — 
"whatever responsibilities rest upon me, as sole heir to 
my father's property, I am anxious to fulfil in 
person. Whatever connection I have with the 
Hayle and Kelso Mills, I am anxious, I am exceed- 
ingly anxious, to meet in person. And I thought," 
added the young lady;-, innocently, " that the
simplest way would be for me to become a part- 
ner." 

" Now I don't know another woman," said 
Maverick, rousing, with an indulgent smile, " who 
could have originated that, father, if she had tried. 
Let us take her in. By all means take her in. 
As she says, what could be simpler.' " 

" Miss Perley will of course understand what 
would be in due time legally and suitably
explained to her," observed Mr. Hayle, " that she 
has, and need have, no responsibilities as heir to 
her father's property ; that she has, and can have, 
no such connection with the Hayle and Kelso 
Mills as requires the least exertion or anxiety 
upon her part." 

" But I don't understand at all," said Perley. 





" I thought I fell heir to all that, with the money. 
At least I thought I could if I wished to." 

" But we 're private, not corporate, don't you 
see ." explained Maverick, carelessly. " You 
don't fall heir to a partnership in a company as 
you would to stock in a corporation, Perley. 
You must see that." 

Probably Perley did not see that in the least. 
The little gold pencil traced a row of greens and 
skipped a row of grays in a sadly puzzled,
unbusiness-like way. 

" You could not fall heir to the partnership 
even if you were a man," continued Maverick, in 
his patronizing fashion. " The choice of a new 
partner, or whether, indeed, there shall be a new 
partner, is a matter resting wholly with the Senior 
and myself to settle. Do I make it clear .? " 

" Quite clear," said Perley, brightening ; " so 
clear, that I do not see anything in the world to 
prevent your choosing me." 

Both gentlemen laughed ; about as much as 
they seemed to think was expected of them. 
Maverick took up the pencil which Perley had 
laid down, and jotted green squares at his end of 
the table. Perley, at hers, slipped her empty 



fingers musingly along a soft gray vein. She 
was half vexed, and a little mortified. For the 
first time in her life, she was inclined to feel 
ashamed of being a woman. She was seriously 
interested, — perhaps, again, for the first time in 
her life, seriously interested — in this matter. A 
faint sense of degradation at being so ignorant 
that she could not command the respect of two 
men sufficiently to the bare discussion of it 
possessed her. 

" One need not be a child because one is a 
woman ! " she said, hotly. 

" The case is just this, my dear," said the 
Senior, kindly observant of her face and tone. 
"Your father dies" — this with a slight, decorous 
sadness in his voice, but mathematically withal, as 
he would propound a sum for Perley's solution : 
A man buys a bushel ; or, A boy sold a yard — 
"your father dies. Maverick and I reorganize 
the firm in our own way : that is our affair. You 
fall heir to a certain share of interest in the 
business : that is your affair. It is for you to say 
what shall be done with your own property. You 
are even quite at liberty to withdraw it entire 
from the concern, or you can leave it in our 





hands, which, I am free to say, we should, in the 
existing state of affairs, prefer — " 

" And expect," interrupted Maverick, pleas- 
antly, making little faces on Perley's pink, shell- 
like nails with the pencil. 

" Which we prefer, and very naturally, under 
the circumstances, expect," continued the Senior. 
" You then receive certain dividends, which will 
be duly agreed upon, and have thus the advan- 
tage of at once investing your property in a safe, 
profitable, and familiar quarter, and of feeling no 
possible obligation or responsibility — business 
obligation and responsibility are always so trying 
to a lady — about it. You thus become, in fact 
and in form, if you prefer, a silent partner. 
Indeed, my dear," finished the Senior, cheerfully, 
" I do not see but this would meet your fancy 
perfectly." 

" Especially as you are going to marry into 
the firm," observed Maverick. 

" Has a silent partner a voice and vote in — 
questions that come up .? " asked Perley, 
hesitating, and rubbing off the little faces from her nails 
with a corner of her soft handkerchief 

" No," said Maverick ; '• none at all. An ordi- 




nary, unprivileged dummy, I mean. If you have 
your .husband's, that 's another matter. A 
woman's influence, you know ; you 've heard of it. 
What could be more suitable .' " 

" Then, if I understand," said Perley, " I invest 
my property in your mills. You call me a silent 
partner, to please me and to stop my asking 
questions. I have nothing to do with the mills 
or the people. I have nothing to do but to spend 
the money and let you manage it. That 's all it 
amounts to." 

" That 's all," said Maverick. 

Perley's light finger and the Junior's pencil 
skirmished across the chess-table for a few 
moments in silence ; the finger from gray to gray ; 
the pencil on green and green ; the finger, by 
chance, it seemed, pursuing; the pencil,
unconsciously, it seemed, retreating, as if pencil-mark 
and finger-touch had been in the first idle stages 
of a long game. 

" Who will go into the firm if I can't t " asked 
Perley, suddenly. 

" Father talks of our confidential clerk," said 
Maverick, languidly, " a fellow we 've promoted 
from East Street, but smart. Smart as a trap. 





Garrick by name. You 've seen him, perhaps, — 
Stephen Garrick. But nothing is settled ; and 
this is submitted," bowing, "to the close
confidence of our silent partner." 

Perley did not seem to be in a mood for gallan- 
try ; did not smile, but only knitted her soft brows.
