with Genevieve ; and I think that is quite excuse 
enough. M. V." 

From time to time during the winter Westover 
wrote to Cynthia, and had letters from her in which 
he pleased himself fancying almost a personal effect 
of that shyness which he thought a charming thing in 
her. But no doubt this was something he read into 
them ; on their face they were plain, straightforward 
accounts of the life she led in the little old house at 
Lion's Head, under the shadow of the black ruin on 
the hill. Westover had taken to sending her books 
and magazines, and in thanking him for these she 
would sometimes speak of things she had read in them. 
Her criticism related to the spirit rather than the 
manner of the things she spoke of, and it pleased him 
that she seemed, with all her insight, to have very 
little artistic sense of any kind; in the world where 
he lived there were so many women with an artistic 
sense in every kind that he was rather weary of it. 



THE LANDLORD AT LION'S HEAD. 

There never was anything about Durgin in the let- 
ters, and Westover was both troubled and consoled by 
this silence. It might be from consciousness, and it 
probably was ; it might be from indifference. In the 
worst event, it hid any pain she might have felt with 
a dignity from which no intimation of his moved her. 
The nearest she came to speaking of JeS was when 
she said that Jombateeste was going to work at the 
Brick-yards in Cambridge as soon as the spring 
opened, and was not going to stay any longer at Lion's 
Head. Her brother Frank, she reported, had got a 
place with part work in the drug-and-book store at 
Lovewell, where he could keep on more easily with his 
studies ; he had now fully decided to study for the 
ministry ; he had always wanted to be an Episcopalian. 

One day towards the end of April, when several 
weeks had passed without bringing Westover any word 
from Cynthia, her father presented himself, and en- 
joyed in the painter's surprise the sensation of having 
dropped upon him from the clouds. He gave due 
accounts of the health of each of his household, end- 
ing with Jombateeste. " You know he's out at the 
Brick, as he calls it, in Cambridge." 

" Cynthia said he was coming. I didn't know he 
had come yet," said Westover. " I must go out and 
look him up, if you think I could find him among all 
those Canucks." 

" Well, I don't know but you'd better look us up at 
the same time," said Whitwell, with additional pleas- 
ure in the painter's additional surprise. " I guess 
we're out in Cambridge, too," he added, at Westover's 



 

start of question. " We're out there, visitin' one of 
our summer folks, as you might say. Remember Mis' 
Fredericks ? " 

" Why, what the deuce kept you from telling me so 
at once ? " Westover demanded, indignantly. 

" Guess I hadn't got round to it," said Whitwell, 
with dry relish. 

"Do you mean that Cynthia's there?" 

" Well, I guess they wouldn't cared much for a visit 
from Â»ie." 

Whitwell took advantage of Westover's moment of 
mystification to explain that Jefif had written over to 
him from Italy, offering him a pretty good rent for 
his house, which he wanted to occupy while he was 
rebuilding Lion's Head. He was going to push the 
work right through in the summer, and be ready for 
the season the year after. That was v,'hat Whitwell 
understood, and he understood that JefE's family was 
going to stay in Lovewell, but Jeff himself wanted to 
be on the ground day and night. 

" So that's kind of turned us out of doors, as you 
may say, and Cynthia's always had this idee of comin' 
down Boston way ; and she didn't know anybody that 
could advise with her as well as Mis' Fredericks, and 
she wrote to her, and Mis' Fredericks answered her to 
come right down and talk it over." Westover felt a 
pang of resentment that Cynthia had not turned to 
him for counsel, but he said nothing, and Whitwell 
went on : " She said she was ashamed to bother you, 
you'd had the whole neighborhood on your hands so 
much, and so she wrote to Mis' Fredericks." 




Westover had a vague discomfort in it all, which 
ultimately defined itself as a discontent with the will- 
ingness of the Whitwells to let Durgin occupy their 
house upon any terms, for any purpose, and a linger- 
ing grudge that Cynthia should have asked help of 
any one but himself, even from a motive of delicacy. 

In the evening he went out to see the girl at the 
house of Mrs. Fredericks, whom he found living in the 
Port. They had a iirst moment of intolerable shyness 
on her part. He had been afraid to see her, with the 
jealousy for her dignity he always felt, lest she should 
look as if she had been unhappy about Durgin. But 
he found her looking, not only very well, but very 
happy and full of peace, as soon as that moment of 
shyness passed. It seemed to Westover as if she had 
begun to live on new terms, and that a harassing ele- 
ment, which had always been in it, had gone out of 
her life, and in its absence she was beginning to re- 
joice in a lasting repose. He found himself rejoicing 
with her, and he found himself on simpler and franker 
terms with her than ever before. Neither of them 
spoke of Jeff, or made any approach to niention him, 
and Westover believed that this was not from a mor- 
bid feeling in her, but from a final and enduring 
indifference. 

He saw her alone, for Mrs. Fredericks and her 
daughter had gone into town to a concert, which he 
made her confess she would have gone to herself if it 
had not been that her father said he was coming out 
to see her. She would not let him joke about the 
sacrifice he pretended she had made ; he had a certain 



 

pain in fancying that his visit was the highest and 
finest favor that life could do her. She told him of 
the ambition she had that she might get a school 
somewhere in the neighborhood of Boston, and then 
find something for her brother to do, while he began 
his studies in the Theological school at Harvard. 
Frant was still at Lovewell, it seemed. 

At the end of the long call he made, he said, 
abruptly, when he had risen to go, " I should like to 
paint you." 

" Who ? Me ? " she cried, as if it were the most in- 
credible thing, while a glad color rushed over her face. 

" Yes. While you're waiting to get your school, 
couldn't you come in with your father, now and then, 
and sit for me ? " 

" What's he want me to come fer ? " Whitwell de- 
manded, when the plan was laid before him. He was 
giving his unlimited leisure to the exploration of Bos- 
ton, and his tone expressed something of the injury 
which he also put into words, as a sole objection to the 
proposed interruption. " Can't you go alone, Cynthy ? " 

Cynthia said she did not know, but when the point 
was referred to Mrs. Fredericis, she was sure Cynthia 
could not go alone, and she acquainted them both, as 
far as she could, with that mystery of chaperonage 
which had never touched their lives before. Whitwell 
seemed to think that his daughter would give the mat- 
ter up ; and perhaps she might have done so, though 
she seemed reluctant, if Mrs. Fredericks had not far- 
ther instructed them that it was the highest possible 
honor Mr. Westover was offering them, and that if he
