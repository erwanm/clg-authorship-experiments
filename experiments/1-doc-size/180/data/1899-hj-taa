was in the air an instant. "That, no doubt, is the best 
way. I thank her very much. I called, after having had 
the honor of dining — I called, I think, three times," he 
went on, with a sudden displacement of the question ; 
''but I had the misfortune each time to miss her." 

She kept looking at him with her crude young clear- 
ness. " I didn't know about that. Mother thinks she's 
more at home than almost any one. She does it on pur- 
pose : she knows what it is,'' Nanda pursued, with her 
perfect gravity, ''for people to be disappointed of find- 
ing her." 

" Oh, I shall find her yet," said Mr. Longdon. " And 
then I hope I shall also find you." 

She appeared simply to consider the possibility and, 
after an instant, to think well of it. "I dare say you 
will now, for now I shall be down." 

Her companion just blinked. "In the drawing-room, 
you mean — always ?" 

It was quite what she meant. " Always. I shall see 
ail the people who come. It will be a great thing for me. 
I want to hear all the talk. Mr. Mitchett says I ought to 
— that it helps to form the young mind. I hoped, for 
that reason," she went on, with the directness that made 
her honesty almost violent — "I hoped there would be 
more people here to-day." 

"I'm very glad there are not!" — the old man rang 
equally clear. "Mr. Vanderbank kindly arranged the 
matter for me just this way. I met him at dinner, at 
your mother's, three weeks ago, and he brought me home 
here that night, when, as knowing you so differently, we 
took the liberty of talking you all over. It had the 
effect, naturally, of making me want to begin with you 
afresh — only that seemed difficult too without further 
help. This he good-naturedly offered me ; he said " — 
and Mr. Longdon recovered his spirits to repeat it — 
" ' Hang it, I'll have them here for you !' " 




I see — lie knew we would come/' Then she caught ' 
herself up. '' But we haven't come, have we ?" i 

'' Oh, it's all right — it's all right. To me the occasion's 
brilliant and the affluence great. I've had such talk 
with those young men — " 

 'I see" — she was again prompt, but beyond any young 
person he had ever met she might have struck him as 
literal. " You're not used to such talk. Neither am I. 
It's rather wonderful, isn't it ? They're thought awfully 
clever, Mr. Van and Mr. Mitchy. Do you like them ?" 
she pushed on. 

Mr. Longdon, who, as compared with her, might have 
struck a spectator as infernally subtle, took an instant to 
think. " I've never met Mr. Mitchett before." 

'•Well, he always thinks one doesn't like liim," Nanda 
explained. ''But one does. One ought to," she added. 

Her companion had another pause. "He likes yoic.'  

Oh, Mr. Longdon needn't have hesitated ! "I know 
he does. He has told mother. He has told lots of peo- 
ple." 

" He has told even you," Mr. Longdon smiled. 

" Yes — but that isn't the same. I don't think he's a 
bit dreadful," she pursued. Still, there was a greater in- 
terest. " Do you like Mr. Van ?" 

This time her interlocutor indeed hung fire. "How 
can I tell ? He dazzles me." 

" But don't you like that ?" Then before he could 
really say : " You're afraid he may be false ?" 

At this he fairly laughed. "You go to the point !" 
She Just colored, to have amused him so, but he quickly 
went on : "I think one has a little natural nervousness 
at being carried off one's feet. I'm afraid I've always 
liked too much to see where I'm going." 

" And you don't, with him ?" She spoke with her 
curious hard interest. " I understand. But I think I 
like to be dazzled." 





 

" Oh, you've got time — you can come round again ; 
you've a margin for accidents, for disappointments and 
recoveries ; you can take one thing with another. But 
Fve only my last little scrap." 

 '' And you want to make no mistakes — I see." 

" Well — I'm too easily upset." 

''Ah, so am I," said Nanda.   I assure you that, in 
spite of what you say, I want to make no mistakes either. 
Fve seen a great many — though you mightn't think it," 
she persisted; "I really know what they may be. Do 
you like me?" she brought forth. But even on this she 
spared him too ; a look appeared to have been enough 
for her.  '  How can you say, of course, already ? — if you 
can't say for Mr. Van. I mean as you've seen him so 
much. When he asked me just now if I liked yoic, I 
told him it was too soon. But it isn't, now ; you see it 
goes fast. I do like you." She gave him no time to ac- 
knowledge this tribute, but, as if it were a matter of 
course, tried him quickly with something else. " Can 
you say if you like mother ?" 

He could meet it pretty well now.  '' There are im- 
mense reasons why I should." 

"Yes — I know about them, as I mentioned: mother 
has told me. ' But what she had to put to him kept up 
his surprise.  '' Have reasons anything to do with it ? I 
don't believe you like her !" she exclaimed.  'She doesn't 
think so," she added. 

The old man's face, at last, partly bewildered, partly 
reassured, showed even more something finer still in the 
effect she produced. " Into what mysteries you plunge !" 

" Oh, we do ; that's what every one says of us. We 
discuss everything and every one — we're always discuss- 
ing each other. I think we must be rather celebrated for 
it, and it's a kind of trick — isn't it? — that's catching. 
But don't you think it's the most interesting sort of 
talk ? Mother says we haven't any prejudices. Yoii 





  

have, probably, quantities — and beantiful ones : so per- 
haps I oughtn't to tell you. But you'll find out for your- 
self." 

 ' Yes — I'm rather slow ; but I generally end by finding 
out. And I've got, thank Heaven," said Mr. Longdon, 
"quite prejudices enough." 

" Then I hope you'll tell me some of them," Nanda re- 
plied in a tone evidently marking how much he pleased 
her. 

"Ah, you must do as / do — you must find out for 
yourself. Your resemblance to your grandmother is 
quite prodigious," he immediately added. 

" That's what I wish you'd tell me about — your recol- 
lection of her and your wonderful feeling about her. 
Mother has told me things, but that I should have some- 
thing straight from you is exactly what she also wants. 
My grandmother must have been awfully nice," the girl 
rambled on, " and I somehow don't see myself at all as 
the same sort of person." 

" Oh, I don't say you're in the least the same sort : all 
I allude to," Mr. Longdon returned, " is the miracle of 
the physical heredity. Nothing could be less like her 
than your manner and your talk."
