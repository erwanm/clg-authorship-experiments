She set her teeth and stared at her glass of water.

"What about my coming-out gown?" she asked.

"I have written him about your début," said Kathleen soothingly.

"Oh! What did the old beast say?"

"He writes," began Kathleen pleasantly, "that he considers eighteen an
unsuitable age for a young girl to make her bow to New York society."

"Did he say that?" exclaimed Geraldine, furious. "Very well; I shall
write to Colonel Mallett and tell him I simply will not endure it any
longer. I've had enough education; I'm suffocated with it! Besides, I
dislike it. I want a dinner-gown and a ball-gown and my hair waved and
dressed on top of my head instead of bunched half way! I want to have an
engagement pad--I want to have places to go to--people expecting me; I
want silk stockings and pretty underclothes! Doesn't that old fool
understand what a girl wants and needs?"

She half rose from her seat at the table, pushing away the fruit which a
servant offered; and, laying her hands flat on the cloth, leaned
forward, eyes flashing ominously.

"I'm getting tired of this," she said. "If it goes on, I'll probably run
away."

"So will I," said Scott, "but I've good reasons. They haven't done
anything to you. You're making a terrible row about nothing."

"Yes, they have! They've suppressed me, stifled me, bottled me up,
tinkered at me, overgroomed me, dressed me ridiculously, and stuffed my
mind. And I'm starved all the time! O Kathleen, I'm hungry! hungry!
Can't you understand?

"They've made me into something I was not. I've never yet had a chance
to be myself. Why couldn't they let me be it? I know--I know that when
at last they set me free because they have to--I--I'll act like a fool;
I'll not know what to do with my liberty--I'll not know how to use
it--how to understand or be understood.... Tell Mr. Tappan that! Tell
him that it is all silly and wrong! Tell him that a young girl never
forgets when other girls laugh at her because she never had any money,
and dresses like a frump, and wears her hair like a baby!... And if he
doesn't listen to us, some day Scott and I will show him and the others
how we feel about it! I can make as much trouble as Scott can; I'll do
it, too----"

"Geraldine!"

"Very well. I'm boiling inside when I think of--some things. The
injustice of a lot of hateful, snuffy old men deciding on what sort of
underclothes a young girl shall wear!... And I will make my début! I
will! I will!"

"Dearest----"

"Yes, I will! I'll write to them and complain of Mr. Tappan's stingy,
unjust treatment of us both----"

"Let me do the writing, dear," said Kathleen quietly. And she rose from
the table and left the dining-room, both arms around the necks of the
Seagrave twins, drawing them close to her sides--closer when her
sidelong glance caught the sullen bitterness on the darkening features
of the boy, and when on the girl's fair face she saw the flushed,
wide-eyed, questioning stare.

When the young, seeking reasons, gaze questioningly at nothing, it is
well to divine and find the truthful answer, lest their other selves,
evoked, stir in darkness, counselling folly.

The answer to such questions Kathleen knew; who should know better than
she? But it was not for her to reply. All she could do was to summon out
of the vasty deep the powers that ruled her wards and herself; and
these, convoked in solemn assembly because of conflict with their Trust
Officer, might decide in becoming gravity such questions as what shall
be the proper quality and cost of a young girl's corsets; and whether or
not real lace and silk are necessary for attire more intimate still.

During the next two years the steadily increasing friction between
Remsen Tappan and his wards began seriously to disturb the directors of
the Half Moon Trust. That worthy old line company viewed with uneasiness
the revolutionary tendencies of the Seagrave twins as expressed in
periodical and passionate letters to Colonel Mallett. The increasing
frequency of these appeals for justice and for intervention
fore-shadowed the desirability of a conference. Besides, there was a
graver matter to consider, which implicated Scott.

When Kathleen wrote, suggesting a down-town conference to decide
delicate questions concerning Geraldine's undergarments and Scott's new
gun, Colonel Mallett found it more convenient to appoint the Seagrave
house as rendezvous.

And so it came to pass one pleasant Saturday afternoon in late October
that, in twos and threes, a number of solemn old gentlemen, faultlessly
attired, entered the red drawing-room of the Seagrave house and seated
themselves in an impressive semicircle upon the damask chairs.

They were Colonel Stuart Mallett, president of the institution, just
returned from Paris with his entire family; Calvin McDermott, Joshua
Hogg, Carl Gumble, Friedrich Gumble; the two vice-presidents, James Cray
and Daniel Montross; Myndert Beekman, treasurer; Augustus Varick,
secretary; the Hon. John D. Ellis; Magnelius Grandcourt 2d, and Remsen
Tappan, Trust Officer.

If the pillars of the house of Seagrave had been founded upon millions,
the damask and rosewood chairs in the red drawing-room now groaned under
the weight of millions. Power, authority, respectability, and legitimate
affluence sat there majestically enthroned in the mansion of the late
Anthony Seagrave, awaiting in serious tribunal the appearance of the
last of that old New York family.

Mrs. Severn came in first; the directors rose as one man, urbane,
sprightly, and gallant. She was exceedingly pretty; they recognised it.
They could afford to.

Compositely they were a smooth, soft-stepping, soft-voiced, company. An
exception or two, like Mr. Tappan, merely accented the composite
impression of rosy-cheeked, neatly shaven, carefully dressed prosperity.
They all were cautious of voice, moderate of speech, chary of gesture.
There was always an impressive pause before a director of the Half Moon
Trust answered even the most harmless question addressed to him. Some
among them made it a conservative rule to swallow nothing several times
before speaking at all. It was a safe habit to acquire. Aut prudens aut
nullus.

Geraldine's starched skirts rustled on the stairway. When she came into
the room the directors of the Half Moon Trust were slightly astonished.
During the youth of the twins, the wives of several gentlemen present
had called at intervals to inspect the growth of Anthony Seagrave's
grandchildren, particularly those worthy and acquisitive ladies who had
children themselves. The far-sighted reap rewards. Some day these baby
twins would be old enough to marry. It was prudent to remember such
details. A position as an old family friend might one day prove of
thrifty advantage in this miserably mercenary world where dog eats dog,
and dividends are sometimes passed. God knows and pities the sorrows of
the rich.

Geraldine, her slim hand in Colonel Mallett's, courtesied with old-time
quaintness, then her lifted eyes swept the rosy, rotund countenances
before her. To each she courtesied and spoke, offering the questioning
hand of amity.

The thing that seemed to surprise them was that she had grown since they
had seen her. Time flies when hunting safe investments. The manners she
retained, like her fashion of wearing her hair, and the cut and length
of her apparel were clearly too childish to suit the tall, slender,
prettily rounded figure--the mature oval of the face, the delicately
firm modelling of the features.

This was no child before them; here stood adorable adolescence, a hint
of the awakening in the velvet-brown eyes which were long and slightly
slanting at the corners; hints, too, in the vivid lips, in the finer
outline of the profile, in faint bluish shadows under the eyes, edging
the curved cheeks' bloom.

They had not seen her in two years or more, and she had grown up. They
had merely stepped down-town for a hasty two years' glance at the
market, and, behind their backs, the child had turned into a woman.

Hitherto they had addressed her as "Geraldine" and "child," when a rare
interview had been considered necessary. Now, two years later,
unconsciously, it was "Miss Seagrave," and considerable embarrassment
when the subject of intimate attire could no longer be avoided.

But Geraldine, unconscious of such things, broached the question with
all the directness characteristic of her.

"I am sorry I was rude in my last letter," she said gravely, turning to
Mr. Tappan. "Will you please forgive me?... I am glad you came. I do not
think you understand that I am no longer a little girl, and that things
necessary for a woman are necessary for me. I want a quarterly
allowance. I need what a young woman needs. Will you give these things
to me, Mr. Tappan?"

Mr. Tappan's dry lips cracked apart; he swallowed grimly several times,
then his long bony fingers sought the meagre ends of his black string
tie:
