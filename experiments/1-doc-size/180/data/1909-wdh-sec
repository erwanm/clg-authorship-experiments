almost the measure of such a walk as one should take 
after supper for one's health, and it had such incidents 
as many pauses for staring up at the many restorations 
going on. From point to point the incomparable Per- 
pendicular Gothic carried the eye to the old gargoyles 
of the eaves and towers waiting to be replaced by the 
new gargoyles, which lay in open-mouthed grimacing 
in the grass at the bases of the church. While I stood 
noting both, and thinking the chances were that I 
should never look on York Minster again, and feel- 
ing the luxurious pang of it, a verger in a skull-cap 
was so good as to come to a side door and parley long 

and pleasantly with a policeman. The simple local life 

 

went on around ; people going to or from supper passed 
me; kind, vulgar noises came from the little houses 
bulging over the narrow, neighboring streets; there 
seemed to be the stamping of horses in a stable, and 
there was certainly the misaspirated talk about them. 
I could not have asked better material for the humble 
emotions I love; and I was more than content on my 
way home to find myself one of the congregation at the 
loud devotions of a detachment of the Salvation Army. 
After a battering of drums and a clashing of cymbals 
and a shouting of hymns, the worship settled to the 
prayer of a weak brother, who was so long in suppli- 
cation that the head exhorter covered a yawn with his 
hand, and at the first sign of relenting in the supplicant 
bade the drums and cymbals strike up. Then, after a 
hymn, a sister, such a very plain, elderly sister, with 
hardly a tooth or an aitch in her head, began to relate 
her religious history. It appeared that she had been a 
much greater sinner than she looked, and that the mercy 
shown her had been proportionate. She was vain both 
of her sins and mercies, poor soul, and in her scrimp 
figure, with its ill-fitting uniform, Heaven knows how 
long she went on. I was distracted by a clergyman 
passing on the outside of the ring of listening women 
and children, and looking, I chose to think, somewhat 
sourly askance at the distasteful ceremonial. I wished 
to stop him, on his way to the Minster, if that was his 
way, and tell him that so Christianity must have be- 
gun, and so the latest form of it must always begin 
and work round after ages and ages to the beauty and 
respectability his own ritual has. But I now believe 
this would have been the greatest impertinence and 
hypocrisy, for I myself found the performance before 
us as tasteless and tawdry as he could possibly have 
done. He was going toward the Minster, and it would 

 

make him forget it; but I was going away from it, 
perhaps, for the last time, and this loud side-show of 
religion would make me forget the Minster. 



Our railway hotel lay a little way out of the town, 
and after a day's sight-seeing we were to meet or min- 
gle with troops of wholesome-looking workmen whose 
sturdiness and brightness were a consolation after the 
pale debility of labor's looks in Sheffield. From the 
chocolate-factories or the railroad-shops, which are the 
chief industries of York, they would be crossing the 
bridge of the Ouse, the famous stream on which the 
Romans had their town, and which suggested to the 
Anglicans to call their Eboracum Eurewic a town on 
a river. In due time the Danes modified this name 
to Yerik, and so we came honestly by the name of our 
own New York, called after the old York, as soon as 
the English had robbed the Dutch of it, and the King 
of England had given the province to his brother the 
Duke of York. Both cities are still towns on rivers, 
but the Ouse is no more an image or forecast of the 
Hudson than Old York is of New York. For that 
reason, the bridge over it is not to be compared to our 
Brooklyn Bridge, or even to any bridge which is yet 
to span the Hudson. The difference is so greatly in 
our favor that we may well yield our city's mother the 
primacy in her city wall. We have ourselves as yet 
no Plantagenet wall, and we have not yet got a medi- 
aeval gate through which the traveller passes in return- 
ing from the Elatiron Building to his hotel in the 
Grand Central Station. 

We do not begin to have such a hoar antiquity as 



is articulate in the mother city, speaking with muted 
voices from the innumerable monuments which the 
earth has yielded from the site of our hotel and its 
adjacent railway station. All underground York is 
doubtless fuller of Rome than even Bath is ; and it has 
happened that her civilization was much more largely 
dug up here than elsewhere when the foundations of 
the spreading edifices were laid. The relics are mainly 
the witnesses of pagan Rome, but Christianity polit- 
ically began in York, as it has politically ended in 
New York, and doubtless some soldiers of the Sixth 
Legion and many of the British slaves were religiously 
Christians in the ancient metropolis before Constantino 
was elected emperor there. 

I have been in many places where history is hos- 
pitably at home and is not merely an unwilling guest, 
as in our unmemoried land. Florence is very well, 
Venice is not so bad, Naples has her long thoughts, and 
Milan is mediaeval-minded, not to speak of Genoa, or 
Marseilles, or Paris, or those romantic German towns 
where the legends, if not the facts, abound ; but, after 
all, for my pleasure in the past, I could not choose any 
place before York. You need not be so very definite 
in your knowledge. The event of Constantine's pres- 
ence and election is so spacious as to leave no room 
for particulars in the imagination ; and you are so rich 
in it that you will even reject them from your thoughts, 
as you sit in the close-cropped flowery lawn of your 
hotel garden (try to imagine a railroad hotel garden 
in New York!) on the sunniest of the afternoons be- 
fore you are turned out for Doncaster Week, and, while 
you watch a little adventurous American boy climbing 
over a pile of rock-work, realize the most august, the 
most important fact in the story of the race as native 
to the very air you are breathing! Where you sit you 

 

are in full view of the Minster, which is to say in 
view of something like the towers and battlements of 
the celestial city. Or if you wake very early on a 
morning still nearer the fatal Doncaster Week of your 
impending banishment, and look out of your lofty win- 
dows at the sunrise reddening the level bars of cloud 
behind the Minster, you shall find it bulked up against 
the pearl-gray masses of the sunny mist which hangs 
in all the intervening trees, and solidifies them in un- 
broken masses of foliage. All round your hotel spreads 
a gridiron of railroad, yet such is the force of the Eng- 
lish genius for quiet that you hear no clatter of trains ; 
the expresses whir in and out of the station with not 
more noise than humming-birds; and amid this peace 
the past has some chance with modernity. The Britons 
dwell, unmolested by our latter - day clamor, in their 
wattled huts and dugouts ; the Romans come and make 
them slaves and then Christians, and after three or 
four hundred years send word from the Tiber to the 
Ouse that they can stay no longer, and so leave them 
naked to their enemies, the Picts and Scots and Saxons 
and Angles; and in due course come the ravaging and 
burning Danes ; and in due course still, the murdering 
and plundering and scorning Normans. But all so 
quietly, like the humming-bird-like expresses, with a 
kind of railway celerity in the foreshortened retro- 
spect ; and after the Normans have crushed themselves 
down into the mass of the vanquished, and formed the 
English out of the blend, there follow the many wars 
of the successions, of the Roses, of the Stuarts, with 
all the intermediate insurrections and rebellions. In 
the splendid Histories of Shakespeare, which are full 
of Yorh, the imagination visits and revisits the place, 
and you are entreated by mouth of one of his princely 

personages, 



" I pray you let us satisfy our eyes 
With the memorials and things of fame, 
That do renown this city," 

where his Henrys and Eichards and Margarets and 
Edwards and Eleanors abide still and shall forever 
abide while the English speech lasts.
