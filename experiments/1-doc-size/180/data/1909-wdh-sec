that I was seeking invited the foot by its level stretch, 
sometimes under wayside trees, but mostly between 
open fields, newly reaped and still yellow with their 
stubble, or green with the rowen clover. Sometimes 
it ran straight and sometimes it curved, but it led so 
rarely near any human habitation that one would rather 
not have met any tramps beside one's self on it. Pres- 
ently I overtook one, a gentle old farm-wife, a withered 

blonde, whom I helped with the bundles she bore in 

 

either hand, in the hope that she could tell me whether 
I was near Marston Moor or not. But she could tell 
me only, what may have been of higher human inter- 
est, that her husband had the grass farm of a hundred 
and fifty acres, which we were coming to, for seventy- 
five pounds a year; and they had their own cattle, 
sheep, and horses, and were well content with them- 
selves. She excused herself for not knowing more than 
vaguely of the battle - field, as not having been many 
years in the neighborhood; and being now come to a 
gate in the fields, she thanked me and took her way 
up a grassy path to the pleasant farmhouse I saw in 
the distance. 

It must have been about this time that it rained, 
having shone long enough for English weather, and 
it hardly held up before I was overtaken by a friend- 
ly youth on a bicycle, whom I stayed with the question 
uppermost in my mind. He promptly got off his wheel 
to grapple with the problem. He was a comely young 
fellow, an artisan of some sort from a neighboring 
town, and he knew the country well, but he did not 
know where my lost battle - field was. He was sure 
that it was near by: but he was sure there was no 
monument to mark the spot. Then we parted friends, 
with many polite expressions, and he rode on and I 
walked on. 

For a mile and more I met no other wayfarer, and 
as I felt that it was time to ask for Marston Moor 
again, I was very glad to be overtaken by a gentleman 
driving in a dog-cart, with his pretty young daughter 
on the wide seat with him. He halted at sight of the 
elderly pilgrim, and hospitably asked if he could not 
give him a lift, alleging that there was plenty of room. 
He was interested in my search, which he was not able 

definitely to promote, but he believed that if I would 

 

drive with him to his place I could find the battle-field, 
and, anyhow, I could get a trap hack from the The 
Sun. I pleaded the heat I was in from walking, and 
the danger for an old fellow of taking cold in a drive 
through the cool air; and then, as old fellows do, we 
hantered each other about our ages, each claiming to be 
older than the other, and the kind, sweet young girl 
sat listening with that tolerance of youth for the trivi- 
ality of age which is so charming. When he could do 
no more, he said he was sorry, and wished me luck, 
and drove on ; and I being by this time tired with my 
three miles' tramp, took advantage of a wayside farm- 
house, the first in all the distance, and went in and 
asked for a cup of tea. 

The farm-wife, who came in out of her back gar- 
den to answer my knock, pleaded regretfully that 
her fire was down; but she thought I could get tea 
at the next house ; and she was very conversable about 
the battle - field. She did not know just where it was, 
but she was sure it was quite a mile farther on; and 
at that I gave up the hope of it along with the tea. 
This is partly the reader's loss, for I have no doubt 
I could have been very graphic about it if I had 
found it; but as for Marston Moor, I feel pretty 
certain that if it ever existed it does not now. A 
moor, as I understand, implies a sort of wildness, 
but nothing could be more domestic than the peaceful 
fields between which I had come so far, and now easily 
found my way back to the station. Easily, I say, but 
there was one point where the road forked, though I 
was sure it had not forked before, and I felt myself 
confronted with some sort, any sort, of exciting ad- 
venture. By taking myself firmly in hand, and say- 
ing, " It was yonder to the left where I met my kind 
bicycler, and we vainly communed of my evanescent 

 

battle-field," and so keeping on, I got safely to the sta- 
tion with nothing more romantic in my experience than 
a thrilling apprehension. 




I quite forgot Marston Moor in my self-gratulation 
and my recognition of the civility from every one which 
had so ineffectively ahetted my search. Simple and 
gentle, how hospitable they had all been to my vain in- 
quiry, and how delicately they had forborne to visit 
the stranger with the irony of the average American 
who is asked anything, especially anything he does not 
know! I went thinking that the difference was a dif- 
ference between human nature long mellowed to its 
conditions, and human nature rasped on its edges and 
fretted by novel circumstances to a provisional harsh- 
ness. I chose to fancy that unhuman nature sym- 
pathized with the English mood; in the sheep bleat- 
ing from the pastures I heard the note of Words- 
worth's verse; and by the sky, hung in its low blue 
with rough, dusky clouds, I was canopied as with a 
canvas of Constable's. 

It was the more pity, then, that at the station a 
shooting party, approaching from the other quarter with 
their servants and guns and dogs, and their bags of 
hares and partridges, should have given English life 
another complexion to the wanderer so willing to see 
it always rose color. The gunners gained the station 
platform first, and at once occupied the benches, strew- 
ing all the vacant places with their still bleeding prey. 
I did not fail of the opportunity to see in them the 
arrogance of class, which I had hitherto so vainly ex- 
pected, and I disabled their looks by finding them as 

 




rude as their behavior. How different they were from 
the kind bicycler, or the gentleman in the dog-cart, or 
either one of the farm-wives who sorrowed so civilly 
not to know where my lost battle-field was ! 

In England, it is always open to the passenger to 
enforce a claim to his share of the public facilities, but 
I chose to go into the licensed victualler's next the 
station and sit down to a peaceable cup of tea rather 
than contest a place on that bloody benching; and so 
I made the acquaintance of an interior out of litera- 
ture, such as my beloved Thomas Hardy likes to paint. 
On a high-backed rectangular settle rising against the 
wall, and almost meeting in front of the comfortable 
range, sat a company of rustics, stuffing themselves 
with cold meat, washed down with mugs of ale, and 
cozily talking. They gained indefinitely in my inter- 
est from being served by a lame woman, with a rhyth- 
mical limp, and I hope it was not for my demerit that 
I was served apart in the chillier parlor, when I should 
have liked so much to stay and listen to the rustic tale 
or talk. The parlor was very depressingly papered, but 
on its walls I had the exalted company of his Majesty 
the King, their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Prin- 
cess of Wales, the late Premier, the Marquis of Salis- 
bury, and, for no assignable reason except a general 
fitness for high society, the twelve Apostles in Da 
Vinci's Last Supper, together with an appropriate view 
of York Minster. 

 

I do not pretend this search for the battle-field of 
Marston Moor was the most exciting episode of my stay 
in York. In fact, I think it was much surpassed in a 

climax of dramatic poignancy incident to our excur- 

 

sion to Bishopsthorpe, down the Ouse, on one of the 
cosey little steamers which ply the stream without un- 
reasonably crowding it against its banks. It was a 
most silvery September afternoon when we started from 
the quay at York, and after escaping from embarkment
