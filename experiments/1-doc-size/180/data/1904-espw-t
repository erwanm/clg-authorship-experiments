hotly. " I know every family in the building. 
I keep them very clean. The sanitary conditions 
are excellent. It is impossible. I 've got 
to see one of my tenants immediately. My 
agent was going to evict him — Please stand 
aside, sir. I am going in." 

" The Board of Health has taken posses- 
sion of your tenement, madam, and I am very 
sorry, but I must insist." 

" So must I," she retorted. " The house is 
mine." 

" But the responsibility is mine," he 
flashed, reddening. " You cannot come in." 

It was now a duel between the citizen and 
the state, and the girl yielded perforce. 

" I am sorry to have to use my authority," 



 

continued the physician in a different tone. 
" The laws, you know, are strict ; and life," 
he hesitated, " is precious." 

" Oh, I suppose you can't help yourself," 
replied Miss Lauriat, not very graciously. 
She took a sudden step or two backwards and 
lifted her face towards the windows, most of 
which were crowded with weeping women and 
angry men. 

" You poor people ! " she cried, " I can't 
help it, and you know I can't. I would if I 
could. I would do anything. Who is it that 's 
sick ? Where is Dan Badger ? I must speak 
with Dan." 

Her upturned throat, showing white 
through the hurrying twilight, rose from her 
furs like a carving by Canova set upon velvet. 
Her impassioned face, fired by the beauty of 
selflessness and pity, swam before the doc- 
tor's eyes. It puzzled him as much as it 
thrilled him. 

A woman's voice, shrill and sobbing, came 
down from above. " It 's Cady's Molly — 
Dan 's right behind you, Miss. lie 's lucky. 
He 's outside. I wish 't we was ! " 

" I won't forget you," Miss Lauriat called 



 

up in her rich, generous voice. " I 'll see the 
doctors. I 'll send a nurse. I 'll do all I can. 
Perhaps there isn't anything in it after all. 
It may not he diphtheria at all ! Perhaps it 's 
only a sore throat." 

The doctor smiled at this unconscious insult 
to his profession and his office ; but the 
tenants were comforted. 

" Here I be, Miss," said a plaintive voice 
behind her. 

" Oh, Dan ! " The young lady turned 
quickly. An undersized, crippled lad, leaning 
on one crutch, stood in the muddy snow, 
watching her like a dog. " So Mr. Smithers 
was going to turn you out, was he ? Why 
didn't you pay your rent?" 

" Couldn't," said Dan patiently. " Trixy 's 
been sick with a cough." 

"Where is Trixy now?" 

" Gone to market for supper — acrosst the 
alley. I 'm a watchin'." 

Still with his back to the door, the doctor 
silently observed the scene. He was waiting 
for his assistant to come back with an officer. 

" You can't go back there, Dan," said the 
lady ruefully. " This gentleman won't let 



 

you. Somebody's sick inside. What will you 
do?" 

"We'll get in somewheres," said Dan 
sweetly ; " there 's places. Don't you fret, 
Miss Laurie." 

" Oh, I can't have that sort of thing," said 
Miss Lauriat decidedly. " You and Trixy 
come to the coach house this evening. We 'll 
put you up, somehow." 

The officer arrived at this moment, and the 
physician gave way, escaping from his uncom- 
fortable position with evident embarrassment. 
As Miss Lauriat turned to go back through 
the darkening alley, he joined her timidly. 
She noticed that he kept as wide a space between 
them as the narrow and now freezing" 
sidewalk permitted. 

" I am really very sorry," he observed with 
a touch of something like humility which sat 
awkwardly upon his dogmatic manner, " that 
I was forced to annoy you so." 

" It does not signify," answered Miss Lau- 
riat, without cordiality. He did not reply, and 
they had walked in silence and constraint for 
some twenty paces, when something whirred 
through the air, and the young lady stopped 



 

and staggered. A big chunk of half-frozen 
slush, shot from an angry hand in the quarantined 
building, and aimed at the retreating 
Board of Health, had missed, and hit the 
girl. A tiny trickle of blood stirred over her 
soft cheek. 

" Oh, damn them ! " cried the doctor be- 
tween his ground teeth, — "I beg your par- 
don ! — Where are you hurt ? " 

" Nowhere, I think," replied Miss Lauriat 
quickly. " Really, it is nothing — just a 
scratch. It's only my ear — a little. They 
didn't mean to. You know they didn't. Oh, 
how sorry they will be ! " 

She put up her soft handkerchief, and 
brushed away the warm stain on her face. 

" Get out of this as fast as you can ! " 
commanded the doctor savagely. He hurried 
her along. " It 's no place for you, anyhow," 
he persisted. " Why do you come here ? what 
do you do it for ? " 

They had now come in sight of the car- 
riage, where Matthew, in his robes, cape, and 
cap, sat like an Esquimau in a fur bag. 
Something in this little touch of ease and 
luxury caused the doctor to draw his breath 



 

with quick relief. At least she was now quite 
safe, — and really not hurt ; no, plainly not 
hurt, as she said. Meant to hurl an ugly 
blow upon the Board of Health, the missile 
had cost the lady but a scratch. 

"What do I do it for?" repeated Miss
