"No woman can be happy who has lost the 
respect of Society." 

" I thought you were bored with Society."

" Yes, but it is mine to have. Being bored 
is quite different from being cast out like a 
pariah." 

" Oh! And you think love a poor substitute ? " 

"Love, of course, is the most wonderful 
thing in the world. (She might be talking of 
maternal or filial love, thought Masters.) 
But it must have the sanction of one's principles, 
one's creed and one's traditions. Otherwise, 
it weighs nothing in the balance." 

" You are a delectable little Puritan," said 
Masters with a laugh that was not wholly 
mirthful. " I shall now read you Tennyson's 



 

* Maud,' as you approve of sentiment, at 
least. Tennyson will never cause the downfall 
of any woman, but if you ever see lightning on 
the horizon don't read 'The Statue and the 
Bust ' with the battery therof ."

WHEN people returned to town they 
were astonished at the change in 
Madeleine Talbot, especially after a summer in 
the duty that would have "torn their own 
nerves out by the roots.'' More than one had 
wondered anxiously if she were going into the 
decline so common in those days. They had 
known the cause of the broken spring, but none 
save the incurably sanguine opined that Howard Talbot had mended it. But mended it was 
and her eyes had never sparkled so gaily, nor 
her laugh rung so lightly since her first winter 
among them. Mrs. McLane suggested charitably that her tedium vitae had run its course 
and she was become a philosopher. 

But Madeleine reviva did not suggest the 
philosopher to the most charitable eye (not 
even to Mrs. McLane's), particularly as there 
was a "something'' about her — was it repressed excitement ? — which had been quite 
absent from her old self, however vivacious 




 

It was Mrs. Abbott, a lady of unquenchable 
virtue, whose tongue was more feared than that 
of any woman in San Francisco, who first verbalized what every friend of Madeleine's secretly wondered: Was there a man in the case ? 
Many loyally cried. Impossible. Madeleine 
was above suspicion. Above suspicion, yes. 
No one would accuse her of a liaison. But who 
was she or any other neglected young wife to 
be above falling in love if some fascinating 
creature laid siege? Love dammed up was 
apt to spring a leak in time, even if it did not 
overflow, and — well, it was known that water 
sought its level, even if it could not run uphill. 
Mrs. Abbott had lived for twenty years in San 
Francisco, and in New Orleans for thirty years 
before that, and she had seen a good many women in love in her time. This climate made 
a plaything of virtue. "Virtue — you said? 
— Precisely. She's not there or we'd see the 
signs of moral struggle, horror, in fact for 
she's not one to succumb easily. But mark my 
words, sh's on the way? 

That point settled, and it was Vastly interesting to believe it (Madeleine Talbot, of all 
people!), who was the man ? Duty to mundane affairs had kept many of the liveliest 
blades and prowling husbands in town all summer but Madeleine had known them all for 
three years or more. Besides, So and So was 
engaged to So and So, and So and So quite 
reprehensibly interested in Mrs. So and So. 

The young gentlemen were discreetly 
sounded, but their lack of anything deeper 
than friendly interest in the " loveliest of her 
sex'' was manifest. Husbands were ordered 
to retail the gossip of the Club, but exploded 
with fury when tactful pumping forced up the 
name of Madeleine Talbot. They were harridans, harpies, old-wives, infernal scandalmongers. If there was one completely blameless woman in San Francisco it was Howard 
Talbot's wife. 

No one thought of Langdon Masters. 

He appeared more rarely at dinners, and 
had never ventured in public with Madeleine 
even during the summer. When his acute 
news sense divined they were gossiping and 
speculating about her he took alarm and considered the wisdom of discontinuing his afternoon visits. But they had become as much a 
part of his life as his daily bread. Moreover, he 



 

could not withdraw without giving the reason 
and it was a more intimate subject than he cared 
to discuss with her. Whether he was in love 
with her or not was a question he deliberately 
refused to face. If the present were destroyed 
there was no future to take its place, and he 
purposed to live in his Fool's Paradise as long 
as he could. It was an excellent substitute for 
tragedy. 

But Society soon began to notice that she no 
longer honored kettledrums or the more 
formal afternoon receptions with her presence, 
and her calls were few and late. When atten- 
tive friends called on her she was "out.'' 
The clerk at the desk had been asked to protect her, as she "must rest in the afternoon." 
He suspected nothing and her word was his 
law. 

When quizzed, Madeleine replied laughingly that she could keep her restored health 
only by curtailing her social activities; but she 
blushed, for lying came hardly. As calling was 
a serious business in San Francisco, she compromised by the ancient clearing-house device 
of an occasional large " At Home," besides her 
usual dinners and luncheons. When Masters 



 

was a dinner guest he paid her only the polite 
attentions due a hostess and flirted elaborately 
with the prettiest of the women. Madeleine, 
who was unconscious of the gossip, was sometimes a Ihtle hurt, and when he avoided her at 
other functions and was far too attentive to 
Sally Ballinger, or Annette McLane, a beautiful girl just out, she had an odd palpitation and 
wondered what ailed her. Jealous ? Well, 
perhaps. Friends of the same sex were often 
jealous. Had not Sally been jealous at one 
time of poor Sibyl Geary ? And Masters was 
the most complete friend a woman ever had. 
She thought sadly that perhaps he had enough 
of her in the afternoon and welcomed a change. 
Well, that was natural enough. She found 
herself enjoying the society of other bright 
men at dinners, now that life was fair again. 

Nevertheless, she experienced a sensation of 
fright now and again, and not because she 
feared to lose him.

THERE is nothing so carking as the pangs 
of unsatisfied curiosity. They may not 
cause the acute distress of love and hate, but 
no tooth ever ached more incessantly nor more 
insistently demanded relief. That doughty 
warrior, Mrs. Abbott, in her own homely language determined to take the bull by the horns. 
She sailed into the Occidental Hotel one afternoon and up the stairs without pausing at the 
desk. The clerk gave her a cursory glance. 
Mrs. Abbott went where she listed, and, moreover, was obviously expected. 

When she reached the Talbot parlor she
