December 17th. 

To-day I happened to read in one of the mag- 
azines an article on a Hterary subject by a college 
professor of some reputation. It was a fine piece 
of work, I thought, very true ; and I got to think- 
ing of him, wondering if he might not be the man. 

I have no hope that these last publishers will 
take the book, and so I made up my mind to 
write to him. 

I wrote what I had written to all the others; 
I told him how I had struggled, and how I was 
living. Perhaps he is less busy than the rest. 

December 19th. 
The manuscript came back to-day. The let- 
ter was simple — the old, meaningless form. I 
am waiting to hear from the professor. 

December 20th. 
" I reply to your letter somewhat against my 
rule — chiefly because of what you tell me about 

your circumstances. I will read your manuscript 
if you still think it worth while to send it to me; 
but I must tell you at the outset that I consider 
the chances very unfavorable, as regards my find- 
ing the work what you believe it. I assure you 
that the literary situation is not in the least 
what you picture it; the book-market was never 
more wide-awake than it is now, the publishers 
are all as eager as possible for the least sign of 
new power; and besides that, the magazines af- 
ford outlet — not only for talent, but for medi- 
ocrity as well. You are entirely mistaken in 
your idea that literary excellence is not equiva- 
lent to commercial availability. If you could 
write one paragraph as noble as the average of 
Dr. , or one stanza as excellent as the aver- 
age of Professor , you would find an instant 

and hearty welcome. 

" Moreover, I believe that you are entirely 
wrong in your ideas of what you need. You will 
not make yourself a great artist by secluding 
yourself from men — go out into the world, young 
man, go out into the world and see what men 
are! 

" As I say, it is not my rule to answer letters 
such as yours. The cry of the suffering is in the 


air every instant, if we heeded it we should 
never get our work done. But I am willing to 
read your poem, if this letter has not chilled your 
ardor." 

— Last night I read The Captive again, and 
it brought the tears into my eyes; and so my ar- 
dor is not chilled, good professor — and I will 
send you the poem. 

— But as for going out into the world — I 
think I am learning what men are pretty fast! 

December 23d. 

My poem stirs me, but it does not last. My 
whole habit of mind seems to me to be changed 
— a deep, settled melancholy has come over me; 
I go about mournful, haunted. I read — but all 
the time I am as if I had forgotten something, 
and as if half my mind were on that. I have lost 
all my ardor — I look back at what I was, and it 
brings the tears into my eyes. It is gone! It is 
gone! It will not ever come back! 

And each day I am drawing nearer to the 
rapids — to the ghastly prospect of having to 
drag myself back to work! 


Oh my God, what shall I do? — tell me any- 
thing, and I will do it! Give me a hope — any 
hope — even a little one! 

The last day I can stretch my miserable pit- 
tance to is the first of February. 

December 25th. 
Christmas Day — and I have no news, ex- 
cept that I am hungry, and that I am sitting in 
my room with a blanket around me, and with a 
miserable cold in my head. 

It is the agony of an unheated room, an old 
acquaintance of mine, that comes with each bit- 
ter winter. I live in a house full of noisy people 
and foul odors; and so I keep my door shut 
while I try to read, and so my room is like a barn. 

I could not accomplish an)rthing to-day — I 
could not read. I felt like a little child. I wanted 
nothing but to hide my head on some one's 
shoulder and sob out all my misery. 

I am nothing but a forlorn child, anyway, lost 
in this great, cruel city. 

— I am not much at pathos; but it was 
Christmas night, and I had one kind of cold in my 
head, and another kind in my feet. 


December 27th. 

I tell you that my salvation was my impa- 
tience! My salvation was that I wasted not an 
instant, that I fought — that I fought ! And each 
hour that I am forced to submit — that I am 
forced to endure and be still — that is an hour of 
ruin! It was those fearful seven weeks that be- 
gan it — and now I shall have to go back to that 
again! Oh my God, how can I bear it? What 
can I do? The pain of it heaps itself up in my 
soul — I am desperate — I will go mad! Tell me 
what to do! Tell me what to do ! 

December 28th. 

I had a strange adventure to-night, a long, 
long adventure. I was free for once in my life! 
Free and glorious — and delivered from earth! 
It happened all in a dream; I sat crouching in the 
corner, thinking. 

I had been walking down the street during 
the day and had seen a flower in a window, and 
had been made happy for a minute, thinking of 
last spring. My step had grown light, and I had
