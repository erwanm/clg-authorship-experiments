profound thought, after his manner.

"I daresay you are right," he said at last. "Will you do it? Or shall I?"

"I would rather not," said the squire, thoughtfully. "You know her
better, you have known her much longer than I."

"But she will ask me where I heard of it," objected the vicar. "I shall
be obliged to say that you told me. That will be as bad as though you
told her yourself."

"You need not say you heard it from me. You can say that Gall has
received instructions to look out for Goddard. She will not question you
any further, I am sure."

"I would much rather that you told her, Mr. Juxon," said the vicar.

"I would much rather that you told her, Mr. Ambrose," said the squire,
almost in the same breath. Both laughed a little.

"Not that I would not do it at once, if necessary," added Mr. Juxon.

"Or I, in a moment," said Mr. Ambrose.

"Of course," returned Mr. Juxon. "Only it is such a very delicate matter,
you see."

"Dear me, yes," murmured the vicar, "a most delicate matter. Poor lady!"

"Poor lady!" echoed the squire. "But I suppose it must be done."

"Oh yes--we cannot do otherwise," answered Mr. Ambrose, still hoping that
his companion would volunteer to perform the disagreeable office.

"Well then, will you--will you do it?" asked Mr. Juxon, anxious to have
the matter decided.

"Why not go together?" suggested the vicar.

"No," said Mr. Juxon firmly. "It would be an intolerable ordeal for the
poor woman. I think I see your objection. Perhaps you think that Mrs.
Ambrose--"

"Exactly, Mrs. Ambrose," echoed the vicar with a grim smile.

"Oh precisely--then I will do it," said the squire. And he forthwith did,
and was very much surprised at the result.




CHAPTER XV.


It was late in the afternoon when Mr. Juxon walked down towards the
cottage, accompanied by the vicar. In spite of their mutual anxiety to be
of service to Mrs. Goddard, when they had once decided how to act they
had easily fallen into conversation about other matters, the black letter
Paracelsus had received its full share of attention and many another rare
volume had been brought out and examined. Neither the vicar nor his host
believed that there was any hurry; if Goddard ever succeeded in getting
to Billingsfield it would not be to-day, nor to-morrow either.

The weather had suddenly changed; the east was already clear and over the
west, where the sun was setting in a fiery mist, the huge clouds were
banked up against the bright sky, fringed with red and purple, but no
longer threatening rain or snow. The air was sharp and the plentiful mud
in the roads was already crusted with a brittle casing of ice.

The squire took leave of Mr. Ambrose at the turning where the road led
into the village and then walked back to the cottage. Even his solid
nerves were a little unsettled at the prospect of the interview
before him; but he kept a stout heart and asked for Mrs. Goddard in his
usual quiet voice. Martha told him that Mrs. Goddard had a bad headache,
but on inquiry found that she would see the squire. He entered the
drawing-room softly and went forward to greet her; she was sitting in a
deep chair propped by cushions.

Mary Goddard had spent a miserable day. The grey morning light seemed to
reveal her troubles and fears in a new and more terrible aspect. During
the long hours of darkness it seemed as though those things were
mercifully hidden which the strong glare of day must inevitably reveal,
and when the night was fairly past she thought all the world must surely
know that Walter Goddard had escaped and that his wife had seen him.
Hourly she expected a ringing at the bell, announcing the visit of a
party of detectives on his track; every sound startled her and her nerves
were strung to such a pitch that she heard with supernatural acuteness.
She had indeed two separate causes for fear. The one was due to her
anxiety for Goddard's safety; the other to her apprehensions for Nellie.
She had long determined that at all hazards the child must be kept from
the knowledge of her father's disgrace, by being made to believe in his
death. It was a falsehood indeed, but such a falsehood as may surely be
forgiven to a woman as unhappy as Mary Goddard. It seemed monstrous that
the innocent child, who seemed not even to have inherited her father's
looks or temper, should be brought up with the perpetual sense of her
disgrace before her, should be forced to listen to explanations of her
father's crimes and tutored to the comprehension of an inherited shame.
From the first Mary Goddard had concealed the whole matter from the
little girl, and when Walter was at last convicted, she had told her that
her father was dead. Dead he might be, she thought, before twelve years
were out, and Nellie would be none the wiser. In twelve years from the
time of his conviction Nellie would be in her twenty-first year; if it
were ever necessary to tell her, it would be time enough then, for the
girl would have at least enjoyed her youth, free of care and of the
horrible consciousness of a great crime hanging over her head. No child
could grow up in such a state as that implied. No mind could develop
healthily under the perpetual pressure of so hideous a secret; from her
earliest childhood her impressions would be warped, her imagination
darkened and her mental growth stunted. It would be a great cruelty to
tell her the truth; it was a great mercy to tell her the falsehood. It
was no selfish timidity which had prompted Mary Goddard, but a carefully
weighed consideration for the welfare of her child.

If now, within these twenty-four hours, Nellie should discover who the
poor tramp was, who had frightened her so much on the previous evening,
all this would be at an end. The child's life would be made desolate for
ever. She would never recover from the shock, and to injure lovely Nellie
so bitterly would be worse to Mary Goddard than to be obliged to bear the
sharpest suffering herself. For, from the day when she had waked to a
comprehension of her husband's baseness, the love for her child had taken
in her breast the place of the love for Walter.

She did not think connectedly; she did not realise her fears; she was
almost wholly unstrung. But she had procured the fifty pounds her husband
required and she waited for the night with a dull hope that all might yet
be well--as well as anything so horrible could be. If only her husband
were not caught in Billingsfield it would not be so bad, perhaps. And yet
it may be that her wisest course would have been to betray him that very
night. Many just men would have said so; but there are few women who
would do it. There are few indeed, so stonyhearted as to betray a man
once loved in such a case; and Mary Goddard in her wildest fear never
dreamed of giving up the fugitive. She sat all day in her chair, wishing
that the day were over, praying that she might be spared any further
suffering or that at least it might be spared to her child whom she so
loved. She had sent Nellie down to the vicarage with Martha. Mrs. Ambrose
loved Nellie better than she loved Nellie's mother, and there was a
standing invitation for her to spend the afternoons at the vicarage.
Nellie said her mother had a terrible headache and wanted to be alone.

But when the squire came Mrs. Goddard thought it wiser to see him. She
had, of course, no intention of confiding to him an account of the events
of the previous night, but she felt that if she could talk to him for
half an hour she would be stronger. He was himself so strong and honest
that he inspired her with courage. She knew, also, that if she were
driven to the extremity of confiding in any one she would choose Mr.
Juxon rather than Mr. Ambrose. The vicar had been her first friend and
she owed him much; but the squire had won her confidence by his noble
generosity after she had told him her story. She said to herself that he
was more of a man than the vicar. And now he had come to her at the time
of her greatest distress, and she was glad to see him.

Mr. Juxon entered the room softly, feeling that he was in the presence of
a sick person. Mrs. Goddard turned her pathetic face towards him and held
out her hand.

"I am so glad to see you," she said, trying to seem cheerful.

"I fear you are ill, Mrs. Goddard," answered the squire, looking at her
anxiously and then seating himself by her side. "Martha told me you had a
headache--I hope it is not serious."

"Oh no--not serious. Only a headache," she said with a smile so unlike
her own that Mr. Juxon began to feel nervous. His resolution to tell her
his errand began to waver; it seemed cruel, he thought, to disturb a
person who was evidently so ill with a matter so serious. He remembered
that she had almost fainted on a previous occasion when she had spoken to
him of her husband. She had not been ill then; there was no knowing what
the effect of a shock to her nerves might be at present. He sat still in
silence for some moments, twisting his hat upon his knee.

"Do not be disturbed about me," said Mrs. Goddard presently. "It will
pass very quickly. I shall be quite well to-morrow--I hope," she added
with a shudder.

"I am very much disturbed about you," returned Mr. Juxon in an unusually
grave tone. Mrs. Goddard looked at him quickly, and was surprised when
she saw the expression on his face. He looked sad, and at the same time
perplexed.

"Oh, pray don't be!" she exclaimed as though deprecating further remark
