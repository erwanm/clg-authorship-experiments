Baffled, blinded, and howling with mingled rage and 
vexation, the Spaniard continued the unequal fight. As 
for Bill Sturdy, he was cool and collected, apparently 
neither angry nor excited, but wary and on the alert. 

At length Antonio, perceiving a marline spike at a 
little distance, sprang towards it. It was a critical 
moment for Bill Sturdy, for a marline spike, m the 
hands of a furious and determined man, is a formidable 
weapon. 

His movement did not escape the notice of Sturdy. 

He had acted principally on the defensive thus far, 
but he now saw that something decisive must be done. 

Springing forward, he closed with his assailant,' lifted 

 



 

him from the deck, and, carrying him to the companionway, hurled him down stairs. 

Then, turning to the crew, he exclaimed, " Shipmates, 
I call you to witness that this quarrel was forced upon 
me. Have I done right or wrong? " 

" Right ! '' exclaimed all, in concert. 

At this moment the mate, attracted by the noise, 
came on deck. 





" What has been going on? " asked Randall, perceiving, from the position of the sailors and their looks-, 
that something had happened. What it was, he surmised, having heard something of the noise of the 
conflict. 

No one of the sailors spoke, but all looked at each 
other in hesitating silence. 

" What was it? Are you all deaf?" demanded the 
mate, impatiently. 

" A little fight, that is all, lilr. Bandall," answered 
Bill Sturdy, coolly hitching up his pants. 

'' And you were one of the parties? '' 

" I believe I was." 

" And who was the other? " 

" Antonio." 

" And where is he now? " 

" He has gone below," said Bill, in a significant tone. 

" What was the fight about?" inquired Bandall, who, 
in ordinary cases, would not have cared to pursue the 
subject farther, but had an undefined idea that it was in 
some way connected with our hero, for whom he felt no 
peculiar affection. 

." The fact is," said Bill Sturdy, " Antonio undertook 




 



 

to abuse that lad there," pointing to Charlie ; " and I 
ain't one to stand'by and see a boy abused. Besides," 
he added, with a latent humor which all understood, 
though he did not allow it to alter the gravity of his 
countenance, " I knew he was your nephew, and that 
made me the more anxious to defend him." 

Randall was placed in an awkward predicament. He 
could not deny that Charlie was his nephew after his 
express declaration to that effect, while at the same time 
the relationship which he claimed was far from exciting, 
in his own mind, any attachment for the boy. Still it 
closed his mouth for the time. He only muttered, in an 
undertone, that the boy must fight his own battles, and 
disappeared from the deck. 

"Fight his own battles!" repeated Sturdy, indig- 
nantly. "A pretty sort of an uncle he is, to match a 
boy of fourteen against a grown man, and a strong one 
at that. However," added Sturdy, complacently, " the 
lad's got a friend that is a match for Antonio at any 
time." 

" That he has," answered a comrade ; " but I say. 
Bill, I couldn't help laughing to see how you made that 
old shark shut up his mouth by telling him it was his 
nephew you were, fighting for. It made him mad, but 
he didn't know what to say against it." 

" His nephew I No, Jack, it's well the lad isn't any 
kith or kin of his. A drop of his blood would be 
enough to -spile a decent lad." 

" Ay, that it would." 

Presently Antonio came on deck with a sullen air, 
half of defiance, half of humiliation, at his recent 
defeat. He smarted under the conviction, that hence- 



 




forth bis authority among the crew would be small. 
Hitherto he had been the champion and bully of the 
quarter-deck, and although the crew had no liking for 
him, but rather a decided feeling of an opposite nature, 
yet strength and prowess always command a certain rude 
respect among sailors, and that respect he enjoyed. But 
now all was changed. He had been beaten, and that in 
a fair fight, where all could see that no underhand means 
had been employed. Strength had been matched against 
strength, and he had come off second best. That had 
been a Waterloo day to him, and he knew that he returned to the deck no longer the same man so far as 
consideration went. 

Bill Sturdy was a generous antagonist. He had no 
idea of indulging in exultation over his vanquished foe, 
but treated him as if nothing had happened. 

But Antonio's resentment was deep and implacable. 
He thirsted for revenge, and determined to lull to sleep 
the suspicions of his late opponent, until some opportunity should present itself for an effectual and safe 
revenge. 

Accordingly he suddenly recovered from his sullenness, and made some half advances towards Sturdy, 
which the latter met, but not without reserve. 

"I can't kind o' feel as if the feller was to be 
trusted," said Bill to Charlie, one evening, as they 
were alone together. "There's something in his eye 
that I don't like ; a sort of deceitful gleam, as if there 
was something covered up that he didn't like to show. 
For my part, I like to be fair and above board, and 
show just what I am." 







 

" I'm soiTy you have made an enemy of this man on 
my account," said Charlie. 

" Avast, my  lad, do you think I was going to stand 
still and let him abuse you? Thank heaven, old Bill 
Sturdy isn't such a lubber as that." 

" But he may do you a mischief yet, Bill." 

"Let him come within the reach of my arm," said 
BO, swinging his brawny, right axm as he would a flail, 
'' I guess he wouldn't want to try it again."
