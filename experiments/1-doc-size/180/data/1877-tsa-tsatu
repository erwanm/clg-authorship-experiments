to desire the riches of Divine love, more than 
gold and silver that perish ; for, just in the de 
gree that God enters into our hearts, does he 
bring in with him aifections opposite to those 
through the resistance of which the door was 
opened. But if there be none of this love and 
delight, it is not well with you, my brother." 

" It is not well with me, I fear," was answered 
in all sadness of spirit; "but, God helping me, I 
will open the door at which I hear him knocking, 
and may he give me delight in his law." 

On the morning of the third day, the white- 
haired preacher left his benediction, and passed 
onward. Many days afterwards, as his enter 
tainer stood at the door of the empty guest-cham 
ber and looked in, these few words fell softly 
from his lips, "An angel unawares." A short 
space he lingered with clasped hands, and eyes 
most earnestly glancing upwards. There had 
come, even as he stood there, an evil allurement, 
and with prayer to God for strength, he had resisted its power. Then flowed in through the 



open door of his heart a love of good, before 
which that evil enticement disappeared, as night 
when the day advances, and his soul was filled 
with blessedness and peace. 




 



XIII. 



" IF I were only in heaven !" 

 There are few mortal lips from which these 
words, or something equivalent to them, have not 
fallen in hours of pain, sorrow, or disappointment, 
when hope in the world grew faint, and the old 
foundations of happiness seemed crumbling into 
ruin. 

" If I were only in heaven !" 

The words came sighing through pale lips. 

"And you expect to go there?" 

The tone in which this was said expressed a 
doubt. 

" We all expect to reach heaven at last. God 
is merciful." 

" He is good to all, and kind even to the un 
thankful and evil. But what is heaven ? Three 




times, within a few days, I have heard you wish 
yourself there." 

" Heaven is a place of happiness ; there are no 
tears there ; no sorrow ; no pain ; no cruel disap 
pointments, nor heart-rending separations. Hea 
ven is heaven. The very word is full of signifi 
cation." 

" And you expect to go there ?" 

A second time was this uttered, and now the 
doubt it expressed quickened in the mind of the 
complainer a feeling that was rather more of earth 
than heaven. 

" You seem to question my fitness," she said, 
with just a shadow of indignation in her voice. 

" Far be it from me to judge the state of any one. 
God alone knoweth the hearts of his children." 

"And still, you ask, in a doubting way, if I 
expect to go to heaven when I die." 

" To a place of happiness, which lies in the far 
distance, and towards which we sail through life 
as mariners on a perilous voyage ?" 

" Yes ; the haven of felicity." 



 

"Where you trust to moor your time-worn 
bark when the stormy ocean is crossed ?" 

" Yes ; trusting in God 's mercy." 

" I'm  afraid you will be disappointed," said 
she who had assumed the office of monitor. 

The pale cheek of the complainer flushed, and 
her sad eyes threw out some rays of light that 
gleamed from an earth-enkindled fire. 

" Heaven is not in the far distance," continued 
her friend. " We do not reach it at the end of 
our earthly journey. We must enter long, long 
before that time, or its sweet rest and peace can 
never be ours. And we are in heaven when our 
souls are filled with heavenly affections. This 
infilling of the soul alone takes place on earth ; 
and thus we enter. We must have some of the 
joys of heaven here, or we cannot receive its 
fuller delights when mortal puts on immortality. 
The life of heaven must be born in us in time, or 
it cannot be developed in eternity. Your present 
state, my dear friend, is not one of preparation 
for that paradise towards which your eyes stretch 



 

so longingly, but one of self-affliction and vain re- 
pinings. You are closing your heart to heavenly 
influences, instead of opening it to their reception. 
I speak plainly, for you have all at stake." 

The flush faded from the complainer 's cheeks ; 
her eyes lost the sudden brightness which had 
gleamed out upon her friend ; and she sat silently 
pondering this strange language strange to her 
while a shade of fear crept into her heart. Were 
her hopes of heaven resting, indeed, on so sandy 
a foundation? Was she vainly looking beyond 
the darkness in which she sat to a world of 
brightness and beauty ? Would there be no hea 
ven for her to enter when the weary burden of 
life was laid down? The questions crowded 
upon her. 

"Come out from beneath the shadows with 
which you have surrounded yourself," said the 
friend, "and enjoy the cheerful sunlight. In 
stead of idly longing for a heaven that lies afar 
off, receive heaven in your heart, in the delight 
that flows in with all good deeds. Be a worker 



 

in the vineyard of your Lord, not a weak repiner j 
a faithful servant, not a talent-hider. They who 
are entering heaven grow more and more peaceful 
in spirit; more and more resigned to the Father 's 
will ; more and more willing to work and wait 
in patient hope. Instead of wishing themselves 
in heaven, as a place of rest afar off, they are 
daily tasting of its sweet felicity." 

" You take away the foundations on which my 
feet have rested. You scatter my hopes to the 
wind. I have looked to you for consolation, but 
you have none to offer." 

" If I have broken the foundations on which 
your feet rested, it is that you may plant them
