mollify her father, he drew back skilfully enough, 
as I have said, and kept the wedding-day still an 
open question. Her faith in his sincerity was so 
complete that she was incapable of suspecting that 
he was playing with her ; her trouble just now was 
of another kind. The poor girl had an admirable 
sense of honor, and from the moment she had 
brought herself to the point of violating her father's 
wish, it seemed to her that she had no right to enjoy 
his protection. It was on her conscience that she 
ought to live under his roof only so long as she 
conformed to his wisdom. There was a great deal 
of glory in such a position, but poor Catherine felt 
that she had forfeited her claim to it. She had cast 
her lot with a young man against whom he had sol- 
emnly warned her, and broken the contract under 
which he provided her with a happy home. She 
could not give up the young man, so she must leave 
the home ; and the sooner the object of her prefer- 
ence offered her another, the sooner her situation 
would lose its awkward twist. This was close rea- 
soning; but it was commingled with an infinite 
amount of merely instinctive penitence. Cathe- 
rine's days, at this time, were dismal, and the weight 
of some of her hours was almost more than she could 
bear. Her father never looked at her, never spoke 
to her. He knew perfectly what he was about, and 
this was part of a plan. She looked at him as much 
as she dared (for she was afraid of seeming to offer 





herself to his observation), and she pitied him for 
the sorrow she had brought upon him. She held up 
her head and busied her hands, and went about her 
daily occupations ; and when the state of things in 
Washington Square seemed intolerable, she closed 
her eyes and indulged herself with an intellectual 
vision of the man for whose sake she had broken a 
sacred law. 

Mrs. Penniman, of the three persons in Washing- 
ton Square, had much the most of the manner that 
belongs to a great crisis. If Catherine was quiet, 
she was quietly quiet, as I may say, and her pathetic 
effects, which there was no one to notice, were en- 
tirely unstudied and unintended. If the Doctor was 
stiff and dry, and absolutely indifferent to the pres- 
ence of his companions, it was so lightly, neatly, easi- 
ly done, that you would have had to know him well 
to discover that, on the whole, he rather enjoyed 
having to be so disagreeable. But Mrs. Penniman 
was elaborately reserved and significantly silent; 
there was a richer rustle in the very deliberate 
movements to which she confined herself, and when 
she occasionally spoke, in connection with some very 
trivial event, she had the air of meaning something 
deeper than what she said. Between Catherine and 
her father nothing had passed since the evening she 
went to speak to him in his study. She had some- 
thing to say to him it seemed to her she ought to 
say it but she kept it back for fear of irritating 
him. He also had something to say to her ; but he 
was determined not to speak first. He was inter- 
ested, as we know, in seeing how, if she were left to 
herself, she would " stick." At last she told him 





she had seen Morris Townsend again, and that their 
relations remained quite the same. 

" I think we shall marry before very long. And 
probably, meanwhile, I shall see him rather often ; 
about once a week not more." 

The Doctor looked at her coldly from head to 
foot, as if she had been a stranger. It was the first 
time his eyes had rested on her for a week, which 
was fortunate, if that was to be their expression. 
" Why not three times a day ?" he asked. " What 
prevents your meeting as often as you choose ?" 

She turned away a moment ; there were tears in 
her eyes. Then she said, " It is better once a week." 

"I don't see how it is better. It is as bad as it 
can be. If you flatter yourself that I care for little 
modifications of that sort, you are very much mis- 
taken. It is as wrong of you to see him once a week 
as it would be to see him all day long. Not that it 
matters to me, however." 

Catherine tried to follow these words, but they 
seemed to lead toward a vague horror from which 
she recoiled. " I think we shall marry pretty soon," 
she repeated, at last. 

Her father gave her his dreadful look again, as if 
she were some one else. "Why do you tell me that ? 
It's no concern of mine." 

" Oh, father," she broke out, " don't you care, even 
if you do feel so ?" 

" Not a button. Once you marry, it's quite the 
same to me when, or where, or why you do it ; and 
if you think to compound for your folly by hoisting 
your fly in this way, you may spare yourself the 
trouble." 





With this he turned away. But the next day he 
spoke to her of his own accord, and his manner was 
somewhat changed. " Shall you be married within 
the next four or five months ?" he asked. 

" I don't know, father," said Catherine. " It is 
not very easy for us to make up our minds." 

" Put it off, then, for six months, and in the mean 
time I will take you to Europe. I should like you 
very much to go." 

It gave her such delight, after his words of the 
day before, to hear that he should " like " her to do 
something, and that he still had in his heart any of 
the tenderness of preference, that she gave a little 
exclamation of joy. But then she became conscious 
that Morris was not included in this proposal, and 
that as regards really going she would greatly 
prefer to remain at home with him. But she blush- 
ed none the less more comfortably than she had 
done of late. "It would be delightful to go to 
Europe," she remarked, with a sense that the idea 
was not original, and that her tone was not all it 
might be. 

" Very well, then, we will go. Pack up your 
clothes." 

" I had better tell Mr. Townsend," said Catherine. 

Her father fixed his cold eyes upon her. " If you 
mean that you had better ask his leave, all that re- 
mains to me is to hope he will give it." 

The girl was sharply touched by the pathetic ring 
of the words ; it was the most calculated, the most 
dramatic little speech the Doctor had ever uttered. 
She felt that it was a great thing for her, under the 
circumstances, to have this fine opportunity of show- 





ing him her respect ; and jet there was something 
else that she felt as well, and that she presently ex- 
pressed. " I sometimes think that if I do what you 
dislike so much, I ought not to stay with you." 

" To stay with me ?" 

" If I live with you, I ought to obey you." 

" If that's your theory, it's certainly mine," said 
the Doctor, with a dry laugh. 

" But if I don't obey you, I ought not to live with 
you to enjoy your kindness and protection." 

This striking argument gave the Doctor a sud-
