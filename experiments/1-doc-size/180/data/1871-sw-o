I believe he thought one way, and I thought 
another." 

" What was the question ? " said Mr. Rich 
mond ; while Norton's face looked up from 
his book, bright with the same query. 

" We were talking it was about opportunities, you know, Mr. Richmond; the 
opportunities that having money gives people; 
and we couldn't tell, Norton and I, how far 
one ought to go. Norton said people must 
stop somewhere ; and I suppose they must. 
Where ought they to stop ? " 

Matilda's face looked very earnest. Norton's, comical. 

" Where ought they to stop in giving money, 
you mean ? " 

" Yes, sir. For doing good, you know, 
and making other people comfortable." 

" It is rather a large question. Were you 




afraid of giving too much, or of giving too 
little?" 

" I think one of us was afraid of giving too 
much, and the other of giving too little." 

" The best way is to go to the Bible and 
see what that says. May I trouble one of 
you to open it at the second epistle to the 
Corinthians, and read what you find in the 
seventh verse of the ninth chapter ? " 

Norton dropped his book and sprang to 
do the service asked for. He read the 
words, 

'" Every man according as he purposeth in 
his heart, so let him give ; not grudgingly, or 
of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful 
giver.' " 

Norton read, and looked up, as much as to 
say, What now ? how does this help ? 

" I don't see how that tells, Mr. Richmond," 
said Matilda. 

" It tells one or two things. You are to 
give out of your heart ; not because somebody 
else asks you, or some other body says you 



 

ought. That would not please God. You 
are to do what you like to do ; much or little, 
as you feel." 

" But ought it to be much or little ? " 
" As you feel. As your heart says." 
" Bat then, Mr. Richmond, will the Lord be 
just as well pleased whether it is much or 
little ? " 

" Norton will please read the sixth verse." 
" ' But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which 
soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.' " 

" But that don't tell either," said Norton, 
when he had read. 

" I think it does," said Matilda slowly. " It 
tells one thing. Mr. Richmond, it doesn't tell 
how much one ought to like to give. That 
was the very question between Norton and 
me ; and we could not settle it." 

" Don't you see, Matilda, that everybody's 
heart would give its own answer to that 
question ? " 



 

" But Mr. Richmond, surely there is a right 
and a wrong answer ? " 

" I am afraid, a good many wrong answers," said Mr. Richmond. 

Norton looked as if he would like to say 
something, but modestly kept back before the 
minister. Mr. Richmond caught the look. 

"Speak out, Norton," said he smiling. 
" Truth will always bear to be looked at." 

" I don't know much about it, sir," said 
Norton. " Only it seems to rne, that if one 
begins to help other people all one can, one 
will soon want helping himself." 

"Ah!" said Mr. Richmond. "Read the 
next verse now." 

" The next to the seventh, sir ? ' And 
God is able to make all grace abound toward 
you; that ye, always having all sufficiency 
in all things, may abound to every good 
work.'" 

" That does not sound as if Matilda were 
in any danger of growing poor through helping Mrs. Eldridge, does it ? " 



 

" But sir ! " said Norton, " the more one 
gives away, the less one has for oneself? " 

" It does not always work so," said Mr. 
Richmond. " The Bible says, ' There is that 
scattereth, and yet increaseth.' ' 

Norton did not know exactly how to fight 
for his opinions, and so was silent, like a well- 
bred boy as he was ; but Matilda's feeling 
was different. 

" I understand," she said ; " at least I think 
I do ; but Mr. Richmond, this does not get 
Norton and me out of our puzzle. You don't 
mean, that people ought to keep nothing for 
themselves ? " 

" ' Every man according as he purposeth in 
his heart,' " Mr. Richmond repeated. " That 
is the order. There have been people, Ma 
tilda, who have given their all for the sake of 
the Lord Jesus, and kept, as you say, nothing 
for themselves. It was in their heart. I can 
not blame them, for one. He did not." 

" But ought every one to do so ? " 

" Matilda, I dare not set any rule but the 



 

rule my Master has set. Tie said, ' He that 
forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be 
my disciple.' " 

" People don't do that, sir," said Norton 
eagerly. 

" Ought they to do it, sir?" said Matilda 
timidly. " To give away all they have got ? " 

" He did not say, ' give away,' but ' forsake.' 
The word means literally ' to take leave of.' 
They give up thinking that what they have is 
their own ; and from that time stand ready to 
give it away entirely, if the Master says so." 

" Is that religion, sir ? " Norton asked. 

" But, Mr. Richmond," Matilda said in 
another tone, " that is the very thing. How
