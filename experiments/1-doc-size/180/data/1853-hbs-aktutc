The Rev. Alex. Glennie, rector of Allsaints parish, Waccamaw, South
Carolina, has for several years been in the habit of preaching with
express reference to slaves. In 1844 he published in Charleston a
selection of these sermons, under the title of “Sermons preached on
Plantations to Congregations of Negroes.” This book contains twenty-six
sermons, and in twenty-two of them there is either a more or less
extended account, or a reference to eternal misery in hell as a motive
to duty. He thus describes the day of judgment (Sermon 15, p. 90):

  When all people shall be gathered before him, “he shall separate
  them, one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
  goats; and he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats
  on the left.” That, my brethren, will be an awful time, when this
  separation shall be going on; when the holy angels, at the command
  of the great Judge, shall be gathering together all the obedient
  followers of Christ, and be setting them on the right hand of the
  Judgment-seat, and shall place all the remainder on the left.
  Remember that each of you must be present; remember that the Great
  Judge can make no mistake; and that you shall be placed on one side
  or on the other, according as in this world you have believed in and
  obeyed him or not. How full of joy and thanksgiving will you be, if
  you shall find yourself placed on the right hand! but how full of
  misery and despair, if the left shall be appointed as your portion!
  * * * *

  But what shall he say to the wicked on the left hand? To them he
  shall say, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
  prepared for the devil and his angels.” He will tell them to depart;
  they did not, while here, seek him by repentance and faith; they did
  not obey him, and now he will drive them from him. He will call them
  cursed.

  (Sermon 1, p. 42.) The death which is the wages of sin is this
  everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. It is a fire
  which shall last forever; and the devil and his angels, and all
  people who will not love and serve God, shall there be punished
  forever. The Bible says, “The smoke of their torment ascendeth up
  for ever and ever.” The fire is not quenched, it never goes out,
  “their worm dieth not;” their punishment is spoken of as a worm
  always feeding upon but never consuming them; it never can stop.

Concerning the absolute authority of the master, take the following
extract from Bishop Mead’s sermon. (Brooke’s Slavery, pp. 30, 31, 32.)

  Having thus shown you the chief duties you owe to your great Master
  in heaven, I now come to lay before you the duties you owe to your
  masters and mistresses here upon earth; and for this you have one
  general rule that you ought always to carry in your minds, and that
  is, to do all service for them as if you did it for God himself.
  Poor creatures! you little consider, when you are idle and
  neglectful of your masters’ business, when you steal and waste and
  hurt any of their substance, when you are saucy and impudent, when
  you are telling them lies and deceiving them; or when you prove
  stubborn and sullen, and will not do the work you are set about
  without stripes and vexation; you do not consider, I say, that what
  faults you are guilty of towards your masters and mistresses are
  faults done against God himself, who hath set your masters and
  mistresses over you in his own stead, and expects that you will do
  for them just as you would do for Him. And, pray, do not think that
  I want to deceive you when I tell you that your masters and
  mistresses are God’s overseers; and that, if you are faulty towards
  them, God himself will punish you severely for it in the next world,
  unless you repent of it, and strive to make amends by your
  faithfulness and diligence for the time to come; for God himself
  hath declared the same.

  Now, from this general rule,—namely, that you are to do all service
  for your masters and mistresses as if you did it for God
  himself,—there arise several other rules of duty towards your
  masters and mistresses, which I shall endeavor to lay out in order
  before you.

  And, in the first place, you are to be obedient and subject to your
  masters in all things.... And Christian ministers are commanded to
  “exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
  please them well in all things, not answering them again, or
  gainsaying.” You see how strictly God requires this of you, that
  whatever your masters and mistresses order you to do, you must set
  about it immediately, and faithfully perform it, without any
  disputing or grumbling, and take care to please them well in all
  things. And for your encouragement he tells you that he will reward
  you for it in heaven; because, while you are honestly and faithfully
  doing your master’s business here, you are serving your Lord and
  Master in heaven. You see also that you are not to take any
  exceptions to the behavior of your masters and mistresses; and that
  you are to be subject and obedient, not only to such as are good,
  and gentle, and mild, towards you, but also to such as may be
  froward, peevish, and hard. For you are not at liberty to choose
  your own masters; but into whatever hands God hath been pleased to
  put you, you must do your duty, and God will reward you for it.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  You are to be faithful and honest to your masters and mistresses,
  not purloining or wasting their goods or substance, but showing all
  good fidelity in all things.... Do not your masters, under God,
  provide for you? And how shall they be able to do this, to feed and
  to clothe you, unless you take honest care of everything that
  belongs to them? Remember that God requires this of you; and, if
  you are not afraid of suffering for it here, you cannot escape the
  vengeance of Almighty God, who will judge between you and your
  masters, and make you pay severely in the next world for all the
  injustice you do them here. And though you could manage so
  cunningly as to escape the eyes and hands of man, yet think what a
  dreadful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, who
  is able to cast both soul and body into hell!

  You are to serve your masters with cheerfulness, reverence, and
  humility. You are to do your masters’ service with good will, doing
  it as the will of God from the heart, without any sauciness or
  answering again. How many of you do things quite otherwise, and,
  instead of going about your work with a good will and a good heart,
  dispute and grumble, give saucy answers, and behave in a surly
  manner! There is something so becoming and engaging in a modest,
  cheerful, good-natured behavior, that a little work done in that
  manner seems better done, and gives far more satisfaction, than a
  great deal more, that must be done with fretting, vexation, and the
  lash always held over you. It also gains the good will and love of
  those you belong to, and makes your own life pass with more ease and
  pleasure. Besides, you are to consider that this grumbling and
  ill-will do not affect your masters and mistresses only. They have
  ways and means in their hands of forcing you to do your work,
  whether you are willing or not. But your murmuring and grumbling is
  against God, who hath placed you in that service, who will punish
  you severely in the next world for despising his commands.

A very awful query here occurs to the mind. If the poor, ignorant slave,
who wastes his master’s temporal goods to answer some of his own present
purposes, be exposed to this heavy retribution, what will become of
those educated men, who, for their temporal convenience, make and hold
in force laws which rob generation after generation of men, not only of
their daily earnings, but of all their rights and privileges as immortal
beings?

The Rev. Mr. Glennie, in one of his sermons, as quoted by Mr. Bowditch,
p. 137, assures his hearers that none of them will be able to say, in
the day of judgment, “I had no way of hearing about my God and Saviour.”

Bishop Meade, as quoted by Brooke, pp. 34, 35, thus expatiates to slaves
on the advantages of their condition. One would really think, from
reading this account, that every one ought to make haste and get himself
sold into slavery, as the nearest road to heaven.

  Take care that you do not fret or murmur, grumble or repine at your
  condition; for this will not only make your life uneasy, but will
  greatly offend Almighty God. Consider that it is not yourselves, it
  is not the people that you belong to, it is not the men that have
  brought you to it, but it is the will of God, who hath by his
  providence made you servants, because, no doubt, he knew that
  condition would be best for you in this world, and help you the
  better towards heaven, if you would but do your duty in it. So that
  any discontent at your not being free, or rich, or great, as you see
  some others, is quarrelling with your heavenly Master, and finding
  fault with God himself, who hath made you what you are, and hath
  promised you as large a share in the kingdom of heaven as the
  greatest man alive, if you will but behave yourself aright, and do
