of laughing, childishly-mocking indifference to the 
results of comparison. Mrs. Acton was an emaci- 
ated, sweet-faced woman of five and fifty, sitting 
with pillows behind her, and looking out on a 
clump of hemlocks. She was very modest, very 
timid, and very ill ; she made Eugenia feel grate- 
ful that she herself was not like that neither 
so ill, nor, possibly, so modest. On a chair, be- 
side her, lay a volume of Emerson's Essays. It 
was a great occasion for poor Mrs. Acton, in her 
helpless condition, to be confronted with a clever 
foreign lady, who had more manner than any 
lady any dozen ladies that she had ever seen. 

" I have heard a great deal about you," she said, 
softly, to the Baroness. 

" From your son, eh ? " Eugenia asked. " He 
has talked to me immensely of you. Oh, he talks 
of you as you would like," the Baroness de- 
clared ; "as such a son must talk of such a 
mother ! " 

Mrs. Acton sat gazing ; this was part of Mad- 
ame Minister's " manner." But Robert Acton 
was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that he had 
barely mentioned his mother to their brilliant 
guest. He never talked of this still maternal 
presence, a presence refined to such delicacy 
that it had almost resolved itself, with him, 



 

simply into the subjective emotion of gratitude. 
And Acton rarely talked of his emotions. The 
Baroness turned her smile toward him, and she 
instantly felt that she had been observed to be 
fibbing. She had struck a false note. But who 
were these people to whom such fibbing was not 
pleasing ? If they were annoyed, the Baroness 
was equally so ; and after the exchange of a few 
civil inquiries and low-voiced responses she took 
leave of Mrs. Acton. She begged Robert not to 
come home with her ; she would get into the car- 
riage alone ; she preferred that. This was impe- 
rious, and she thought he looked disappointed. 
While she stood before the door with him the 
carriage was turning in the gravel-walk this 
thought restored her serenity. 

When she had given him her hand in farewell 
she looked at him a moment. " I have almost de- 
cided to dispatch that paper," she said. 

He knew that she alluded to the document that 
she had called her renunciation ; and he assisted 
her into the carriage without saying anything. 
But just before the vehicle began to move he said, 
" Well, when you have in fact dispatched it, I 
hope you will let me know ! " 



VII. 

FELIX YOUNG finished Gertrude's portrait, 
and he afterwards transferred to canvas the feat- 
ures of many members of that circle of which it 
may be said that he had become for the time the 
pivot and the centre. I am afraid it must be con- 
fessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter, 
and that he imparted to his models a romantic 
grace which seemed easily and cheaply acquired 
by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young 
man who made " sitting " so entertaining. For 
Felix was paid for his pictures, making, as he did, 
no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to 
the Western world affectionate curiosity had gone 
hand in hand with a desire to better his condition. 
He took his uncle's portrait quite as if Mr. Went- 
worth had never averted himself from the experi- 
ment ; and as he compassed his end only by the 
exercise of gentle violence, it is but fair to add 
that he allowed the old man to give him nothing 
but his time. He passed his arm into Mr. Went- 
worth's one summer morning very few arms in- 
deed had ever passed into Mr. Wentworth's 



 

and led him across the garden and along the road 
into the studio which he had extemporized in the 
little house among the apple-trees. The grave 
gentleman felt himself more and more fascinated 
by his clever nephew, whose fresh, demonstrative 
youth seemed a compendium of experiences so 
strangely numerous. It appeared to him that 
Felix must know a great deal ; he would like to 
learn what he thought about some of those things 
as regards which his own conversation had always 
been formal, but his knowledge vague. Felix had 
a confident, gayly trenchant way of judging hu- 
man actions which Mr. Wentworth grew little by 
little to envy ; it seemed like criticism made easy. 
Forming an opinion say on a person's conduct 
was, with Mr. Wentworth, a good deal like 
fumbling in a lock with a key chosen at hazard. 
He seemed to himself to go about the world with 
a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at 
his girdle. His nephew, on the other hand, with 
a single turn of the wrist, opened any door as 
adroitly as a horse-thief. He felt obliged to keep 
up the convention that an uncle is always wiser 
than a nephew, even if he could keep it up no 
otherwise than by listening in serious silence to 
Felix's quick, light, constant discourse. But there 
came a day when he lapsed from consistency and 
almost asked his nephew's advice. 



   

" Have you ever entertained the idea of settling 
in the United States?" he asked one morning, 
while Felix brilliantly plied his brush. 

"My dear uncle," said Felix "excuse me if 
your question makes me smile a little. To begin 
with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas 
often entertain me ; but I am afraid I have never 
seriously made a plan. I know what you are 
going to say ; or rather, I know what you think, 
for I don't think you will say it that this is 
very frivolous and loose-minded on my part. So 
it is ; but I am made like that ; I take things as 
they come, and somehow there is always some new 
thing to follow the last. In the second place, I 
should never propose to settle. I can't settle, my 
dear uncle ; I 'm not a settler. I know that is 
what strangers are supposed to do here ; they al- 
ways settle. But I haven't to answer your 
question entertained that idea." 

" You intend to return to Europe and resume 
your irregular manner of life?" Mr. Wentworth 
inquired. 

" I can't say I intend. But it 's very likely I 
shall go back to Europe. After all, I am a Eu- 
ropean. I feel that, you know. It will depend a 
good deal upon my sister. She 's even more of a 
European than I ; here, you know, she 's a picture 
out of her setting. And as for ' resuming,' dear 



 

uncle, I really have never given up my irregular 
manner of life. What, for me, could be more ir- 
regular than this ? " 

"Than what?" asked Mr. Wentworth, with 
his pale gravity. 

" Well, than everything ! Living in the midst 
of you, this way ; this charming, quiet, serious 
family life ; fraternizing with Charlotte and Ger- 
trude ; calling upon twenty young ladies and go- 
ing out to walk with them ; sitting with you in the
