Soak the crumbs in the milk; rub the butter and sugar to a cream, and
put with the beaten yolks. Beat up this mixture with the soaked crumbs;
stir in the corn-starch; then the whisked whites, flavoring, and,
at the last, the grated cocoanut. Beat hard one minute; pour into a
buttered pudding-dish—the same in which it is to be served—and bake in
a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.

Eat very cold, with powdered sugar on top.


IMPROMPTU CHRISTMAS PUDDING. (Very fine.)

2 cups of best mince meat made for Christmas pies. Drain off all
superfluous moisture. If the meat be rather too dry for pies, it will
make the better pudding.

1½ cups prepared flour.

6 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.

Whip the eggs and stir the yolks into the mince-meat. Beat them in hard
for two or three minutes until thoroughly incorporated. Put in the
whites and the flour, alternately beating in each instalment before
adding the next. Butter a large mould very well; put in the mixture,
leaving room for the swelling of the pudding, and boil five hours
steadily. If the boiling should intermit one minute, there will be a
heavy streak in the pudding. Six hours’ boiling will do no harm.

Turn out upon a hot dish; pour brandy over it and light just as it goes
into the dining-room. Eat with rich sauce. I know of no other pudding
of equal excellence that can be made with so little trouble as this,
and is as apt to “turn out well.”

If you have no mince-meat in the house, you can buy an admirable
article, ready made, at any first-class grocery store. It is put up in
neat wooden cans (which are stanch and useful for holding eggs, starch,
etc., after the mince-meat is used up) and bears the stamp, “ATMORE’S
CELEBRATED MINCE MEAT.”

And what is noteworthy, it deserves to be “celebrated.” It has never
been my good fortune to meet with any other made mince-meat that
could compare with it.


LEMON SOUFFLÉ PUDDING.

1 heaping cup of prepared flour.

2 cups of rich milk.

½ cup of butter.

Juice of 1 lemon and half the grated peel.

4 table-spoonfuls of sugar.

5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately and very light.

Chop the butter into the flour. Scald the milk and stir into it while
still over the fire, the flour and butter. When it begins to thicken,
add it, gradually, to the beaten yolks and sugar. Beat all up well
and turn out to cool in a broad dish. It should be cold when you whip
in the stiffened whites. Butter a mould; pour in the mixture, leaving
abundance of room for the soufflé to earn its name—and steam one hour
and a half, keeping the water under the steamer at a fast, hard boil.

When done, dip it into cold water for an instant, let it stand one
minute, after you take it out of this, and turn out upon a hot dish.

Eat with brandy sauce.


LÉCHE CRÉMA SOUFFLÉ. +

1 quart of milk.

3 table-spoonfuls corn-starch, wet with cold milk.

1 cup powdered sugar.

½ cup strawberry jam, or sweet fruit jelly.

6 eggs—beaten very light.

Flavoring to taste.

Boil the milk, and stir in the corn-starch. Stir one minute and pour
into a bowl containing the yolks, the whites of two eggs and half
the sugar. Whip up for two or three minutes and put into a nice
baking-dish, buttered. Set in a pan of boiling water and bake half an
hour, or until firm. Just before withdrawing it from the oven, cover
with jelly or jam, put on dexterously and quickly, and this, with a
méringue made of the reserved whites and sugar. Shut the oven until
the méringue is set and slightly colored.

Eat cold, with cream.


CHERRY SOUFFLÉ PUDDING.

1 cup prepared flour.

2 cups of milk.

5 eggs.

3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.

Bitter almond flavoring.

½ pound crystallized or glacé cherries.

A pinch of salt.

Scald the milk, and stir into it the flour, wet up with a cup of
the milk. Boil one minute, stirring well up from the bottom of the
farina-kettle; mix in the yolks beaten light with the sugar, flavor,
and let it get perfectly cold. Then whip the whites until you can cut
them with a knife, and beat, fast and hard, into the custard. Butter a
mould thickly; strew with the cherries until the inside is pretty well
covered; put in the mixture—leaving room for puffing—and boil for an
hour and a half.

Dip into cold water; take it out and let it stand, after the lid is
removed, a full minute, before turning it out.

Eat warm with wine, or lemon sauce.


SPONGE-CAKE SOUFFLÉ PUDDING. +

12 square (penny) sponge-cakes—stale.

5 eggs.

1 cup milk.

2 glasses sherry.

½ cup of powdered sugar.

Put the cakes in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish; pour the wine
over them, and cover while you make the custard. Heat the milk and pour
over the yolks of the eggs, beaten and strained, and half the sugar.
Return to the fire, and stir until quite thick. Pour this upon the
soaked cakes, slowly, that they may not rise to the top; put in the
oven, and when it is again very hot, spread above it the whites whisked
stiff with the rest of the sugar.

Bake ten minutes, or until the méringue is lightly browned and firm.
Serve in the baking-dish.

Eat cold. It will be found very nice.


APPLE SOUFFLÉ PUDDING. +

6 or 7 fine juicy apples.

1 cup fine bread-crumbs.

4 eggs.

1 cup of sugar.

2 table-spoonfuls butter.

Nutmeg and a little grated lemon-peel.

Pare, core and slice the apples, and stew in a covered farina-kettle,
without a drop of water, until they are tender. Mash to a smooth pulp,
and, while hot, stir in butter and sugar. Let it get quite cold, and
whip in, first the yolks of the eggs, then the whites—beaten very
stiff—alternately with the bread-crumbs. Flavor, beat hard three
minutes, until all the ingredients are reduced to a creamy batter, and
bake in a buttered dish, in a moderate oven. It will take about an
hour to cook it properly. Keep it covered until ten minutes before you
take it out. This will retain the juices and prevent the formation of a
crust on the top.
