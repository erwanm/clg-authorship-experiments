besides had pictures well hung in Munich, and 
in more than one gallery at home. 

At last, after ten years of hard work, struggles, 
and disappointments, he began to enjoy a meas 
ure of success. He and Gethryn saw little of 
each other this winter, excepting at Julien s. 
That last visit to the Rue Monsieur le Prince 
was never mentioned between them. They were 
as cordial when they met as ever, but Braith 
did not visit his young friend any more, and 
Gethryn never spoke to him of Yvonne. 

"Good-bye, old chap!" Braith would say, 
when they parted, gripping Rex's hand and 





smiling at him. But Rex did not see Braith's 
face as he walked away. 

Braith felt helpless. The thing he most 
dreaded for Rex had happened; he believed he 
could see the end of it all, and yet he could 
prevent nothing. If he should tell Rex that 
he was being ruined, Rex would not listen, and 
who was he that he should preach to another 
man for the same fault by which he had wasted 
his own life? No, Rex would never listen to 
him, and he dreaded a rupture of their friend 
ship. 

Gethryn had made his debut in the Salon 
with a certain amount of eclat. True, he had 
been disappointed in his expectations of a med 
al, but a first mention had soothed him a little, 
and, what was more important, it proved to be 
the needed sop to his discontented aunt. But 
somehow or other his new picture did not pro 
gress rapidly, or in a thoroughly satisfactory 
manner. In bits and spots it showed a certain amount of feverish brilliancy, yes, even 
mature solidity; in fact, it was nowhere bad, 
but still it was not Gethryn and he knew that. 

"Confound it!" he would mutter, standing 



back from his canvas; but even at such times, 
he could hardly help wondering at his own 
marvelous technique. 

"Technique be'd ned! Give me stupidity 
in a pupil every time, rather than cleverness," 
Harrington had said to one of his pupils, and the 
remark often rang in Gethryn's ears even when 
his eyes were most blinded by his own wonder 
ful facility. 

"Some fools would medal this," he thought; 
"but what pleasure could a medal bring me 
when I know how little I deserve it?" 

Perhaps he was his own hardest critic, but it 
was certain that the old, simple honesty, the 
subtle purity, the almost pathetic effort to tell 
the truth with paint and brush, had nearly dis 
appeared from Gethryn's canvases during the last 
eight months, and had given place to a fierce 
and almost startling brilliancy, never, perhaps, 
hitting, but always threatening some brutal note 
of discord. 

Even Elise looked vaguely troubled, though 
she always smiled brightly at Gethryn's criticism of his own work. 

"It is so very wonderful and dazzling, but - 
but the color seems to me unkind." 





And he would groan and answer, "Yes v yes, 
Elise, you're right; oh, I can never paint anoth 
er like the one of last June !" 

"Ah, that!" she would cry, "that was delicious "but checking herself, she would add, 
"Courage, let us try again; I am not tired, 
indeed I am not" 

Yvonne never came into the studio when Gethryn had models, but often, after the light was 
dim, and the models had taken their leave, she 
would slip in, and, hanging lightly over his 
shoulder, her cheek against his, would stand 
watching the touches and retouches with which 
the young artist always eked out the last rays 
of daylight. And when his hand drooped, and 
she could hardly distinguish his face in the 
gathering gloom, he would sigh and turn to her, 
smoothing the soft hair from her forehead, say 
ing: "Are you happy, Yvonne?" And Yvonne 
always answered, "Yes, Rex, when you are." 

Then he would laugh, and kiss her and tell 
her he was always happy with La Belle He"lene, 
and they would stand in the gathering twilight 
until a gurgle from the now well-grown pups 
would warn them that the hour of hunger had 
arrived, 



 

The triumvirate, with Thaxton, Rhodes, 
Carleton, and the rest, had been frequent visitors all winter at the "Menagerie," as Clifford's 
bad pun had named Gethryn's apartment; but, 
of late, other social engagements and, possibly, 
a small amount of work, had kept them away. 
Clifford was a great favorite with Yvonne. . 
Thaxton and Elliott she liked. Rowden she 
tormented, and Carleton she endured. She 
captured Clifford by suffering him to play his 
banjo to her piano. Rowden liked her because 
she was pretty and witty, though he never got 
used to her quiet little digs at his own respected 
and dignified person. Clifford openly avowed 
his attachment, and spent many golden hours 
away from work, listening to her singing. She 
had been taught by a good master, and her 
voice was pure and pliant, although as yet only 
half developed. The little concerts they gave 
their friends were really charming, with 
Clifford's banjo, Gethryn's guitar, Thaxton's 
violin, Yvonne's voice and piano. Clifford made 
the programmes. They were profusely illustrated, and he spent a great deal of time rehearsing, writing verses, and re-hashing familiar airs 





(he called it "composing"), which would have 
been as well devoted to his easel. 

In Rowden, Yvonne was delighted to find 
a cultivated musician. Clifford listened to their 
talk of chords and keys, went and bought a 
"Musical Primer" on the Quai'd Orsay, spent 
a wretched hour groping over it, swore softly, 
and closed the book forever. 

But neither the triumvirate nor the others had 
been to the "Menagerie" for over a fortnight, 
when Rowden, feeling it incumbent upon him 
to return some of Gethryn's hospitality, issued 
very proper cards, indeed they were very swell 
cards for the Latin Quarter, for a "dinner," 
to be followed by a "quiet evening" at the Bal 
Masqud at the Opera. 

The triumvirate had accordingly tied up their 
brindled bull-dogs, "Spit," "Snap" and "Tug;" 
had donned their white ties and collars of awful 
altitude, and were fully prepared to please and 
to be pleased. Although it was nominally a 
"stag" party, the triumvirate would as soon have 
cut off their tender mustaches as have failed to 
invite Yvonne. But she had replied to Row- 
den's invitation by a dainty little note, ending: 



 

"and I am sure that you will understand when I 
say that this time I will leave you gentlemen in 
undisturbed possession of the evening, for I
