that the life of a man, or a race, may dive for 
and not exhaust. 

Bearing this clearly in mind, the first thing 
which we observe about the Bible is that it 
is a human history, written by men, and for 
men, and to be judged by human standards. 





Whatever God has to do with it is for us a 
matter of inference, not of assumption. What- 
ever be the supernatural element in it, we are 
to decide as a result, not as a condition, of 
our study of the book. We are not to bring 
to this study an a priori conviction that the 
whale did, any more than that he did not, 
swallow Jonah. 

All that any believer in the Bible has a 
right to ask, or needs to ask, is that it should 
be subjected to the same historical laws 
which govern other books. If historical science 
should do away with the personality of 
Adam, — what then ? The believer should 
be the last to insist upon it for the truth's 
sake ; the reality of Revelation is not affected 
by the surrender of this or that trifling detail 
or theory ; it would be ruined by an evasion 
of truth. If the Bible cannot stand the same 
tests with other histories, we want to know 
it, and we want to be the first to know it. 

It is the belief of careful Christian scholar- 
ship, as it is the concession of the fairest skep- 
tical learning, that the book stands the test. 
Kenan says of the Gospels : " All, in my 
judgment, date back to the first century, and 

they are substantially by the authors to whom 
they are attributed." 

We have a human history of at least equal 
claims with others ; with, at all events, no 
more than their share of errors, inconsisten- 
cies, and difficulties ; to be handled with the 
same critical skill and honor as Josephus and 
Xenophon and Grote ; and was it not Les- 
sing who said, " If Livy and Dionysius and 
Polybius and Tacitus are so candidly and 
liberally treated that we do not stretch them 
on the rack for a syllable, why should not 
Matthew and Mark and Luke and John be 
treated as well " ? 

We shall not, however, quarrel with him 
who demands that the Scriptures be handled 
with greater critical skill than other histories ; 
their claims are greater, and may require it ; 
but we insist that, for the same reason, the 
intellectual and moral candor of the critic shall 
be guarded in proportion to the size of the 
subject and the cause at stake. No human 
history has received and endured the critical 
strain which has been brought to bear upon 
the Christian Scriptures. A German scholar 
once wrote a keen little book, in which he 
applied to the personality of Martin Luther the 
same kinds of historical methods which have 
been exercised upon that of Christ, thereby 
proving the general untrustworthiness of the 
fact of Luther. Another skillful writer has, by 
a similar treatment, shown, with marked effect, 
that Caesar was never assassinated. Whateley's 
application of this principle to Napoleon 
is a familiar instance in the same direction. 

Whatever Revelation reveals, then, it cannot 
be too clearly emphasized that it reveals 
by sifting through the hard, fine sieve of 
human history. The natural way God chose, and 
chose it in this most natural form. We have 
to deal with the records of an ancient people ; 
with their remoteness and barbarism, their 
politics, progress, and decline ; with their 
superstitions and faith, their virtues and vices, 
their pretensions and claims ; and, further, 
with whatever moral or spiritual objects the 
internal evidence of the Book may offer as 
sufficient reasons for the selection of  this 
particular people for the position of extraordinary 
importance which their Scriptures have given 
them in the world's thought. 

The Bible reveals once more, in a degree 
unequaled by any human production, a power 
of adaptation to human consciousness. " The 
Bible finds me," said Coleridge, " as nothing 
else does." Assuming that God had preferred 
the literary method and had chosen a collection 
of Hebrew chronicles, poems, and letters as 
the medium of communicating to men some- 
thing of value which Nature had not expressed, 
it would be expected that he would appeal, so 
far as his media permitted, to that which un- 
derlies all philosophy and defies all dogma- 
tism. " There is a point of view beyond the 
sphere of philosophy," says Goethe, " namely, 
that of common sense." There are a few 
things about ourselves which we know ; to 
these the Bible addresses itself with a subtlety 
and a force which, to be sure, taken by them- 
selves, it is not necessary to call supernatural, 
but which certainly transcend anything which 
we have yet experienced in other literary in- 
fluences. 

Men have misery, an uneasy conscience, 
disenchantment with life, reluctance to death, 
desire for eternal existence, and isolation of 
the soul. We do not turn to our Dante for 
such a plain, old-fashioned thing as comfort ; 


Goethe has no forgiveness to offer a stained 
nature shuddering and cowering before itself ; 
Homer lends few illusions to the unconfessed 
emptiness of our days ; Virgil does not draw 
the sting from the fang of our last hours ; 
Shakespeare cannot promise us immortality, 
nor draw near to the inner solitude in which 
all men walk, but the sensitive perish. 

Great grief and great guilt drive mankind 
where they can get something greater. Strong 
fear and strong hope hold us where we can 
find something stronger. Sin and suffering 
are the deepest facts of life. Real emotions 
are a keen touchstone to the real. The common 
crises, the plebeian forces, the plain, 
universal fates and chances, test our prophets and 
ourselves. 

" Though I am a Hellene at heart," confessed 
the invalid Heine, " the book has not 
only well entertained me, but also deeply 
edified me. What a book ! . . . The whole 
drama of humanity (is) in this book. It is 
the book of books — Biblia." 

" Need you ask ? " said the dying Scott, 
when requested to name the book which he 
would have read. " Need you ask ? There is 
but one." 



Quarrel with it as we may, doubt it as we 
often must, perplexed by it as we shall always 
be, criticise it as we dare, neglect it as we 
do, the fact remains, and remains one of august 
significance, that, in those emergencies 
of life which are fathoms deep below all intellectual
querulousness or self-delusion, the 
Bible grasps us as the very hand of God 
might do, if we could find in this fact alone 
sufficient proof that the hand of God is in it. 

We have our infectious as well as our 
incommunicable doubts. Unbelief is subject 
to fashions. The scientific pose is so clearly 
a la mode, it would seem strange that it has 
overlooked in the Bible by far the most important
support which can be found for the 
theories which teach us to believe in the 
evolution of the race. 

Revelation reveals the only clear basis of
