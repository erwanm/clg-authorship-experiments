"That girl in Paris, whom we heard at the old actress's 
and whom we afterwards met at the charming entertainment 
given by your cousin (isn't he?) the secretary of embassy." 

" Oh, Peter's girl : of course I remember her." 

" Don't call her Peter's ; call her rather mine," Nash said, 
with good-humoured dissuasiveness. "I invented her, I 
introduced her, I revealed her." 

" I thought on the contrary you ridiculed and repudiated 
her." 

" As an individual, surely not ; I seem to myself to have 
been all the while rendering her services. I said I disliked 
tea-party ranters, and so I do ; but if my estimate of her 
powers was below the mark she has more than punished me." 
" What has she done ? " asked Nick. 
" She has become interesting, as I suppose you know." 





" How should I know ? " 

" You must see her, you must paint her," said Nash. 
" She tells me that something was said about it that day at 
Madame Carre's." 

" Oh, I remember said by Peter." 

" Then it will please Mr. Sherringham you'll be glad to 
do that. I suppose you know all he has done for Miriam ? " 

" Not a bit. I know nothing about Peter's affairs, unless 
it be in general that he goes in for mountebanks and mimes 
and that it occurs to me I have heard one of my sisters 
mention the rumour had come to her that he has been 
backing Miss Kooth." 

" Miss Rooth delights to talk of his kindness : she's charm- 
ing when she speaks of it. It's to his good offices that she 
owes her appearance here." 

"Here? Is she in London ?" Nick inquired. 

" D'ou tombez-vous ? I thought you people read the papers." 

" What should I read, when I sit (sometimes !) through the 
stuff they put into them ? " 

" Of course I see that that your engagement at your own 
theatre keeps you from going to others. Learn then," said 
Gabriel Nash, " that you have a great competitor and that 
you are distinctly not, much as you may suppose it, the rising 
comedian. The Tragic Muse is the great modern personage. 
Haven't you heard people speak of her, haven't you been taken 
to see her?" 

"I dare say I've heard of her; but with a good many 
other things on my mind I had forgotten it." 

" Certainly I can imagine what has been on your mind. 
She remembers you at any rate ; she repays neglect with 
sympathy. She wants to come and see you." 

"To see me?" 

"To be seen by you it comes to the same thing. She's 
worth seeing : you must let me bring her ; you'll find her very 
suggestive. That idea that you should paint her she appears 
to consider it a sort of bargain." 

" A bargain ? What will she give me ? " Nick asked. 

" A splendid model. She is splendid." 

" Oh, then bring her," said Nick. 



XXV. 

NASH brought her, the great modern personage as ne had 
described her, the very next day, and it took Nick Dormer 
but a short time to appreciate his declaration that Miriam 
Rooth was splendid. She had made an impression upon him 
ten months before, but it had haunted him only for a day, 
immediately overlaid with other images. Yet after Nash had 
spoken of her a few moments he evoked her again ; some of 
her attitudes, some of her tones began to hover before- him. 
He was pleased in advance with the idea of painting her. 
When she stood there in fact however it seemed to him that 
lie had remembered her wrong : the brilliant young lady who 
instantly filled his studio with a presence that it had never 
known was exempt from the curious clumsiness which had 
interfused his former admiration of her with a certain pity. 
Miriam Rooth was light and bright and straight to-day 
straight without being stiff and bright without being garish. 
To Nick's perhaps inadequately sophisticated mind the model, 
the actress were figures with a vulgar setting ; but it would 
have been impossible to show that taint less than his present 
extremely natural yet extremely distinguished visitor. She 
was more natural even than Gabriel Nash ("nature" was 
still Nick's formula for his old friend), and beside her he 
appeared almost commonplace. i 

Nash recognized her superiority with a frankness that was 
honourable to both of them, testifying in this manner to his 
sense that they were all three serious beings, worthy to deal 
with realities. She attracted crowds to her theatre, but to 
his appreciation of such a fact as that, important doubtless in 
its way, there were limits which he had already expressed. 
What he now felt bound in all integrity to express was his 
perception that she had, in general and quite apart from the 
question of the box-office, a remarkable, a very remarkable 
artistic nature. He confessed that she had surprised him 
there ; knowing of her in other days mainly that she was 
hungry to adopt an overrated profession, he had not imputed 
to her the normal measure of intelligence. Now he saw he 
had had some talks with her that she was intelligent ; so 
much so that he was sorry for the embarrassment it would be 
to her. Nick could imagine the discomfort of having that 





sort of commodity to dispose of in such conditions. " She's a 
distinguished woman really a distinguished woman," Nash 
explained, kindly and lucidly, almost paternally ; " and the 
head you can see for yourself." 

Miriam, smiling, as she sat on an old Venetian chair, held 
aloft, with the noblest effect, that portion of her person to 
which this patronage was extended, and remarked to Nick 
that, strange as it might appear, she had got quite to like poor 
Mr. Nash : she could make him go about with her ; it was a 
relief to her mother. 

" When I take him she has perfect peace," the girl said ; 
" then she can stay at home and see the interviewers. She 
delights in that and I hate it, so our friend here is a great 
comfort. Of course & fernme de theatre is supposed to be able 
to go out alone, but there's a kind of appearance, an added 
chic, in having some one. People think he's my companion ; 
J'm sure they fancy I pay him. I would pay him rather than 
give him up, for it doesn't matter that he's not a lady. He is 
one in tact and sympathy, as you see. And base as he thinks 
the sort of thing I do, he can't keep away from the theatre. 
When you're celebrated, people will look at you who before 
could never find out for themselves why they should." 

" When you're celebrated you become handsomer ; at least 
that's what has happened to you, though you were pretty 
too of old," Gabriel argued. " I go to the theatre to look 
at your head ; it gives me the greatest pleasure. I take up 
anything of that sort as soon as I find it ; one never knows 
how long it may last." 

" Are you speaking of my appearance  ? " Miriam asked. 

"Dear no, of my own pleasure, the first freshness," Nash 
went on. " Dormer at least, let me tell you in justice to 
him, hasn't waited till you were celebrated to want to see 
you again (he stands there open-eyed) ; for the simple reason 
that he hadn't the least idea of your renown. I had to 
announce it to him." 

"Haven't you seen me act  ?" Miriam asked, without 
reproach, of her host. 

"I'll go to-night," said Nick. 

" You have your Parliament, haven't you ? What do they 
call it the demands of public life ? '' Miriam continued : to 
which Gabriel Nash rejoined that he had the demands of 
private as well, inasmuch as he was in love he was on the 
point of being married. Miriam listened to this with par-
