do you do?'' 

George had to face her. ''How do you 
do?" he responded, weakly. 

She held out her hand and he had to take 
it, but there was not much welcome in his 
clasp. ''Where have you been keeping 
yourself?" she asked. Then, as he hesi- 
tated, she laughed good-naturedly, "What's 
the matter? You don't seem glad to see 
me." 

The girl — 'TherSse was her name — 'had a 
Httle package under her arm, as if she had 
been shopping. She was not well dressed, 
as when George had met her before, and 
doubtless she thought that was the reason 
for his lack of cordiahty. This made him 
rather ashamed, and so, only half reahzing 
what he was doing, he began to stroll along 
with her. 

"Why did you never come to see me 
again?" she asked. 



 

George hesitated. ''I — 'I — " he stam- 
mered — ''I've been married since then." 

She laughed. "Oh! So that's it!" 
And then, as they came to a bench under 
some trees, "Won't you sit down a while?" 
There was allurement in her glance, but it 
made George shudder. It was incredible 
to him that he had ever been attracted 
by this crude girl. The spell was now 
broken completely. 

She quickly saw that something was 
wrong. "You don't seem very cheerful," 
she said. "What's the matter?" 

And the man, staring at her, suddenly 
blurted out, "Don't you know what you 
did to me?" 

"What I did to you?" Ther'se repeated 
wonderingly. 

"You must know!" he insisted. 

And then she tried to meet his gaze and 
could not. "Why — " she stammered. 

There was silence between them. When 
George spoke again his voice was low and 
trembling. "You ruined my whole life," 
he said — "not only mine, but my family's. 
How could you do it?" 



 

She strove to laugh it off. ''A cheerful 
topic for an afternoon stroll!" 

For a long while George did not answer. 
Then, almost in a whisper, he repeated, 
''How could you do it?" 

''Some one did it to me first," was the 
response. "A man!" 

"Yes," said George, "but he didn't 
know." 

"How can you tell whether he knew or 
not?" 

"You knew?" he inquired, wonderingly. 

Th'rese hesitated. "Yes, I knew," she 
said at last, defiantly. "I have known for 
years." 

"And I'm not the only man." 

She laughed. "I guess not!" 

There followed a long pause. At last 
he resumed, "I don't want to blame you; 
there's nothing to be gained by that; it's 
done, and can't be undone. But sometimes 
I wonder about it. I should like to under- 
stand — 'why did you do it?" 

"Why? That's easy enough. I did it 
because I have to live." 

"You five that way?" he exclaimed. 



 

''Why of course. What did you think?" 

''I thought you were a — a. — " He 
hesitated. 

''You thought I was respectable' laughed 
Therese. "Well, that's just a little game 
I was playing on you." 

"But I didn't give you any money!" 
he argued. 

"Not that time," she said, "but I thought 
you would come back." 

He sat gazing at her. "And you earn 
your living that way still?" he asked. 
"When you know what's the matter with 
you! When you know — " 

"What can I do? I have to Hve, don't 
I?" 

"But don't you even take care of your- 
self? Surely there must be some way, 
some place — " 

"The reformatory, perhaps," she sneered. 
"No, thanks! I'll go there when the police 
catch me, not before. I know some girls 
that have tried that." 

"But aren't you afraid?" cried the man. 
''And the things that will happen to you! 
Have you ever talked to a doctor — or 
read a book?" 



 

''I know," she said. ''IVe seen it all. 
If it comes to me, I'll go over the side of 
one of the bridges some dark night." 

George sat lost in thought. A strange 
adventure it seemed to him — to meet this 
girl under such different circumstances! 
It was as if he were watching a play from 
behind the scenes instead of in front. If 
only he had had this new view in time — 'how 
different would have been his life! And 
how terrible it was to think of the others 
who didn't know — 'the audience who were 
still sitting out jn front, watching the 
spectacle, interested in it! 

His thoughts came back to Therese. He 
was curious about her and the life she lived. 
''Tell me a little about it," he said. ''How 
you came to be doing this." And he 
added, '' Don't think I want to preach; 
I'd really like to understand." 

''Oh, it's a common story," she said — 
'' nothing especially romantic. I came to 
Paris when I was a girl. My parents had 
died, and I had no friends, and I didn't 
know what to do. I got a place as a nurse- 
maid. I was seventeen years old then.
