with him--expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time.”

The brougham was nearing home, and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing
opportunity that caused the Colonel’s next meditation to flower in a
fashion almost surprising to his wife. They were united, for the most
part, but by his exhausted patience; so that indulgent despair was
generally, at the best, his note. He at present, however, actually
compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that
he had followed her steps. He literally asked, in short, an intelligent,
well nigh a sympathising, question. “Gratitude to the Prince for not
having put a spoke in her wheel--that, you mean, should, taking it in
the right way, be precisely the ballast of her boat?”

“Taking it in the right way.” Fanny, catching at this gleam, emphasised
the proviso.

“But doesn’t it rather depend on what she may most feel to BE the right
way?”

“No--it depends on nothing. Because there’s only one way--for duty or
delicacy.”

“Oh--delicacy!” Bob Assingham rather crudely murmured.

“I mean the highest kind--moral. Charlotte’s perfectly capable of
appreciating that. By every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him
alone.”

“Then you’ve made up your mind it’s all poor Charlotte?” he asked with
an effect of abruptness.

The effect, whether intended or not, reached her--brought her face short
round. It was a touch at which she again lost her balance, at which,
somehow, the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort. “Then
you’ve made up yours differently? It really struck you that there IS
something?”

The movement itself, apparently, made him once more stand off. He
had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question.
“Perhaps that’s just what she’s doing: showing him how much she’s
letting him alone--pointing it out to him from day to day.”

“Did she point it out by waiting for him to-night on the stair-case in
the manner you described to me?”

“I really, my dear, described to you a manner?” the Colonel, clearly,
from want of habit, scarce recognised himself in the imputation.

“Yes--for once in a way; in those few words we had after you had watched
them come up you told me something of what you had seen. You didn’t
tell me very much--THAT you couldn’t for your life; but I saw for myself
that, strange to say, you had received your impression, and I felt
therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for
you so to betray it.” She was fully upon him now, and she confronted him
with his proved sensibility to the occasion--confronted him because of
her own uneasy need to profit by it. It came over her still more than at
the time, it came over her that he had been struck with something, even
HE, poor dear man; and that for this to have occurred there must have
been much to be struck with. She tried in fact to corner him, to
pack him insistently down, in the truth of his plain vision, the very
plainness of which was its value; for so recorded, she felt, none of
it would escape--she should have it at hand for reference. “Come, my
dear--you thought what you thought: in the presence of what you saw you
couldn’t resist thinking. I don’t ask more of it than that. And your
idea is worth, this time, quite as much as any of mine--so that you
can’t pretend, as usual, that mine has run away with me. I haven’t
caught up with you. I stay where I am. But I see,” she concluded, “where
you are, and I’m much obliged to you for letting me. You give me a point
de repere outside myself--which is where I like it. Now I can work round
you.”

Their conveyance, as she spoke, stopped at their door, and it was, on
the spot, another fact of value for her that her husband, though seated
on the side by which they must alight, made no movement. They were in a
high degree votaries of the latch-key, so that their household had gone
to bed; and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman
waited in peace. It was so indeed that for a minute Bob Assingham
waited--conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise
than by the so obvious method of turning his back. He didn’t turn
his face, but he stared straight before him, and his wife had already
perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire--
proof, that is, of her own contention. She knew he never cared what
she said, and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more
eloquent. “Leave it,” he at last remarked, “to THEM.”

“‘Leave’ it--?” She wondered.

“Let them alone. They’ll manage.”

“They’ll manage, you mean, to do everything they want? Ah, there then
you are!”

“They’ll manage in their own way,” the Colonel almost cryptically
repeated.

It had its effect for her: quite apart from its light on the familiar
phenomenon of her husband’s indurated conscience, it gave her, full in
her face, the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty.
It was wonderful truly, then, the evocation. “So cleverly--THAT’S your
idea?--that no one will be the wiser? It’s your idea that we shall have
done all that’s required of us if we simply protect them?”

The Colonel, still in his place, declined, however, to be drawn into a
statement of his idea. Statements were too much like theories, in
which one lost one’s way; he only knew what he said, and what he said
represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness
had been capable. Still, none the less, he had his point to make--for
which he took another instant. But he made it, for the third time, in
the same fashion. “They’ll manage in their own way.” With which he got
out.

Oh yes, at this, for his companion, it had indeed its effect, and while
he mounted their steps she but stared, without following him, at his
opening of their door. Their hall was lighted, and as he stood in the
aperture looking back at her, his tall lean figure outlined in darkness
and with his crush-hat, according to his wont, worn cavalierly, rather
diabolically, askew, he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his
meaning. In general, on these returns, he came back for her when he had
prepared their entrance; so that it was now as if he were ashamed to
face her in closer quarters. He looked at her across the interval,
and, still in her seat, weighing his charge, she felt her whole view
of everything flare up. Wasn’t it simply what had been written in the
Prince’s own face BENEATH what he was saying?--didn’t it correspond with
the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of?
Wasn’t, in fine, the pledge that they would “manage in their own way”
 the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from
him? Her husband’s tone somehow fitted Amerigo’s look--the one that had,
for her, so strangely, peeped, from behind, over the shoulder of the one
in front. She had not then read it--but wasn’t she reading it when she
now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared? She wasn’t
to be squared, and while she heard her companion call across to her
“Well, what’s the matter?” she also took time to remind herself that
she had decided she couldn’t be frightened. The “matter”?--why, it was
sufficiently the matter, with all this, that she felt a little sick. For
it was not the Prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily
the shaky one. Shakiness in Charlotte she had, at the most, perhaps
postulated--it would be, she somehow felt, more easy to deal with.
Therefore if HE had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves.
There was nothing to choose between them. It made her so helpless that,
as the time passed without her alighting, the Colonel came back
and fairly drew her forth; after which, on the pavement, under the
street-lamp, their very silence might have been the mark of something
grave--their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and
their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together,
like some old Darby and Joan who have had a disappointment. It almost
resembled a return from a funeral--unless indeed it resembled more the
hushed approach to a house of mourning. What indeed had she come home
for but to bury, as decently as possible, her mistake?



                             XVII

It appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom,
the two friends, from the moment they should understand their position
aright. With the Prince himself, from an early stage, not unnaturally,
Charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it; she had
found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity, and, her
resignation tempered, or her intelligence at least quickened, by
irrepressible irony, she applied at different times different names to
the propriety of their case. The wonderful thing was that her sense of
propriety had been, from the first, especially alive about it. There
were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the
commonest tact--as if this principle alone would suffice to light their
way; there were others when it might have seemed, to listen to her, that
their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most
independent, not to say original, interpretation of signs. She talked
now as if it were indicated, at every turn, by finger-posts of almost
ridiculous prominence; she talked again as if it lurked in devious
ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar; and she even, on
occasion, delivered herself in the sense that, as their situation was
unprecedented, so their heaven was without stars. “‘Do’?” she once
had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly, though briefly,
occurring between them on her return from the visit to America that had
immediately succeeded her marriage, determined for her by this event as
promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed
in his own case. “Isn’t the immense, the really quite matchless beauty
of our position that we have to ‘do’ nothing in life at all?--nothing
except the usual, necessary, everyday thing which consists in one’s not
being more of a fool than one can help. That’s all--but that’s as true
