stranger who had come down from the house. 
"A gentleman, Ma'am," she announced; and, 
retiring while Mrs. Beever rose to meet the vis- 





itor, she drew, with the noise of a lawn-mower, a 
starched tail along the grass. 

Dennis Vidal, with his hat off, showed his 
hostess a head over which not a year seemed to 
have passed. He had still his young, sharp, 
meagre look, and it came to her that the other 
time as well he had been dressed in double- 
breasted blue of a cut that made him sailorly. 
It was only on a longer view that she saw his 
special signs to be each a trifle intensified. He 
was browner, leaner, harder, finer ; he even struck 
her as more wanting in height. These facts, how 
ever, didn't prevent another fact from striking 
her still more: what was most distinct in his 
face was that he was really glad to take her by 
the hand. That had an instant effect on her : 
she could glow with pleasure, modest matron as 
she was, at such an intimation of her having, so 
many years before, in a few hours, made on a 
clever young man she liked an impression that 
could thus abide with him. In the quick light 
of it she liked him afresh ; it was as if their friend 
ship put down on the spot a firm foot that was 
the result of a single stride across the chasm of 
time. In this indeed, to her clear sense there 
was even something more to pity him for : it was 



 

such a dreary little picture of his interval, such 
an implication of what it had lacked, that there 
had been so much room in it for an ugly old 
woman at Wilverley. She motioned him to sit 
down with her, but she immediately remarked 
that before she asked him a question she had an 
important fact to make known. She had delayed 
too long, while he waited there, to let him under 
stand that Rose Armiger was at Eastmead. She 
instantly saw, at this, that he had come in com 
plete ignorance. The range of alarm, in his face, 
was narrow ; but he coloured, looking grave ; 
and after a brief debate with himself he inquired 
as to Miss Armiger's actual whereabouts. 

"She has gone out, but she may reappear at 
any moment," said Mrs. Beever. 

" And if she does will she come out here ? " 

"I've an impression she'll change her dress 
first. That may take her a little time." 

" Then I'm free to sit with you ten minutes ? " 

" As long as you like, dear Mr. Vidal. It's for 
you to choose whether you'll avoid her." 

"I dislike dodging I dislike hiding," Dennis 
returned; "but I daresay that if I had known 
where she was I wouldn't have come." 

"I feel hatefully rude but you took a leap 





in the dark. The absurd part of it," Mrs. Beever 
went on, "is that you've stumbled on her very 
first visit to me." 

The young man showed a surprise which gave 
her the measure of his need of illumination. 
"For these four years?" 

" For these four years. It's the only time she 
has been at Eastmead." 

Dennis hesitated. "And how often has she 
been at the other house?" 

Mrs. Beever smiled. " Not even once." Then 
as her smile broadened to a small, dry laugh, " I 
can quite say that for her ! " she declared. 

Dennis looked at her hard. " To your certain 
knowledge ? " 

"To my certain and absolute knowledge." 
This mutual candour continued, and presently 
she said: "But you where do you come from?" 

"From far away 'I've been out of England. 
After my visit here I went back to my post." 

" And now you've returned with your fortune ? " 

He gave her a smile from which the friendliness 
took something of the bitter quality. "Call it 
my misfortune ! " There was nothing in this to 
deprive Mrs. Beever of the pleasant play of a 
professional sense that he had probably gathered 



 

an independence that would have made him wel 
come at the Bank. On the other hand she caught 
the note of a tired grimness in the way he added: 
"I've come back with that. It sticks to me!" 

She spared him a minute. " You want her as 
much as ever?" 

His eyes confessed to a full and indeed to a 
sore acceptance of that expression of the degree. 
" I want her as much as ever. It's my constitu 
tional obstinacy ! " 

" Which her treatment of you has done nothing 
to break down?" 

"To break down? It has done everything in 
life to build it up." 

"In spite of the particular circumstance ?" 

At this point even Mrs. Beever's directness failed. 

That of her visitor, however, was equal to the 
occasion. " The particular circumstance of her 
chucking me because of the sudden glimpse given 
her by Mrs. Bream's danger of the possibility of a 
far better match ? " He gave a laugh drier than 
her own had just been, the ring of an irony from 
which long, hard thought had pressed all the 
savour. " That ' particular circumstance,' dear 
Madam, is every bit that's the matter with 
me!" 





"You regard it with extraordinary coolness, 
but I presumed to allude to it " 

"Because," Dennis broke in with lucidity, "I 
myself made no bones of doing so on the only 
other occasion on which we've met." 

" The fact that we both equally saw, that we 
both equally judged," said Mrs. Beever, " was on 
that occasion really the only thing that had time 
to pass between us. It's a tie, but it's a slender 
one, and I'm all the more flattered that it should 
have had any force to make you care to see me 
again." 

" It never ceased to be my purpose to see you, 
if you would permit it, on the first opportunity. 
My opportunity," the young man continued, " has 
been precipitated by an accident. I returned to 
England only last week, and was obliged two days 
ago to come on business to Southampton. There 
I found I should have to go, on the same matter, 
to Marrington. It then appeared that to get to 
Marrington I must change at Plumbury "
