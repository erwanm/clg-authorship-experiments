else, much more of a little person to reckon 
with. Yes, that was a part of the positive 
awkwardness that he carried off by being 
almost foolishly tender. There was a passage 
during which, on a yellow silk sofa, under 





one of the palms, he had her on his knee, 
stroking her hair, playfully holding her off 
while he showed his shining fangs and let 
her, with a vague, affectionate, helpless, 
pointless "Dear old girl, dear little daugh- 
ter!" inhale the fragrance of his cherished 
beard. She must have been sorry for him, 
she afterwards knew ; so well could she pri- 
vately follow his difficulty in being specific 
to her about anything. She had such pos- 
sibilities of vibration, of response, that it 
needed nothing more than this to make up 
to her in fact for omissions. The tears came 
into her eyes again as they had come when, 
in the Park that day, the Captain told her so 
excitingly that her mother was good. What 
was this but exciting too, this still directer 
goodness of her father and this unexampled 
shining solitude with him, out of which 
everything had dropped but that he was papa 
and that he was magnificent? It didn't 
spoil it that she finally felt he must have, as 
he became restless, some purpose he did n't 
quite see his way to bring out ; for in the 
freshness of their recovered fellowship she 
would have lent herself gleefully to his sug- 
gesting, or even to his pretending, that their 
relations were easy and graceful. There was 





something in him that seemed and quite 
touchingly -to ask her to help him to pre- 
tend, pretend he knew enough about her life 
and her education, her means of subsistence 
and her view of himself, to give the ques- 
tions he couldn't put her a natural domestic 
tone. She would have pretended with ecstasy 
if he could only have given her the cue. She 
waited for it while, between his big teeth, 
he breathed the sighs she did n't know to be 
stupid; and as if he had drawn rather red 
with the confusion of it the pledge of her 
preparation from her tears, he floundered 
about, wondering what the devil he could lay 
hold of.

WHEN he had lighted a cigarette and begun 
to smoke in her face it was as if he had 
struck with the match the note of some queer, 
clumsy ferment of old professions, old scan- 
dals, old duties, a dim perception of what he 
possessed in her and what, if everything had 
only, damn it, been totally different, she 
might still be able to give him. What she 
was able to give him, however, as his blink- 





ing eyes seemed to make out through the 
smoke, would be simply what he should be 
able to get from her. To give something, to 
give here on the spot, was all her own desire. 
Among the old things that came back was 
her little instinct of keeping the peace; it 
made her wonder more sharply what particu- 
lar thing she could do or not do, what partic- 
ular word she could speak or not speak, what 
particular line she could take or not take that 
might, for every one, even for the Countess, 
give a better turn to the crisis. She was 
ready, in this interest, for an immense sur- 
render, a surrender of everything but Sir 
Claude, of everything but Mrs. Beale. The 
immensity didn't include them; but if he 
had an idea at the back of his head she had 
also one in a recess as deep, and for a time, 
while they sat together, there was an extraor- 
dinary mute passage between her vision of 
this vision of his, his vision of her vision and 
her vision of his vision of her vision. What 
there was no effective record of indeed was 
the small strange pathos on the child's part 
of an innocence so saturated with knowledge 
and so directed to diplomacy. What, fur- 
ther, Beale finally laid hold of while he 
masked again with his fine presence half the 





flounces of the fireplace was : " Do you know, 
my dear, I shall soon be off to America? " 

It struck his daughter both as a short cut 
and as the way he would n't have said it to 
his wife. But his wife figured with a bright 
superficial assurance in her response. " Do 
you mean with Mrs. Beale ? " 

Her father looked at her hard. "Don't 
be a little ass!" 

Her silence appeared to represent a con- 
centrated effort not to be. " Then with the 
Countess?" 

"With her or without her, my dear that 
concerns only your poor daddy. She has big 
interests over there, and she wants me to 
take a look at them." 

Maisie threw herself into them. "Will 
that take very long ? " 

" Yes ; they 're in such a muddle it may 
take months. Now what I want to hear, you 
know, is whether you would like to come 
along." 

Planted once more before him in the 
middle of the room, she felt herself turning 
white. " I ? " she gasped, yet feeling as 
soon as she had spoken that such a note of 
dismay was not altogether pretty. She felt 
it still more while her father replied, with a 





shake of his legs, a toss of his cigarette-ash 
and a fidgety look he was forever taking 
one all the length of his waistcoat and 
trousers, that she need n't be quite so dis- 
gusted. It helped her in a few seconds to 
appear more as he would like her that she 
saw, in the lovely light of the Countess's 
splendor, exactly, however she appeared, the 
right answer to make. " Dear papa, I 'll go 
with you anywhere." 

He turned his back to her and stood with 
his nose at the glass of the chimneypiece while 
he brushed specks of ash out of his beard. 
Then he abruptly said : " Do you know any- 
thing about your brute of a mother? " 

It was just of her brute of a mother that 
the manner of the question in a remarkable 
degree reminded her: it had the free flight 
of one of Ida's fine bridgings of space. With 
the sense of this was kindled for Maisie at 
the same time an inspiration. " Oh, yes, I 
know everything ! " and she became so 
radiant that her father, seeing it in the 
mirror, turned back to her and presently, on 
the sofa, had her on his knee again and was 
again particularly stirring. Maisie' s inspi- 
ration was to the effect that the more she 
should be able to say about mamma the less
