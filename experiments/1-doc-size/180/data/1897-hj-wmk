He whacked his hand again with his papers. 
" I had really much better take you." 

"And leave Maisie here alone?" 

Mamma so clearly didn't want it that 
Maisie leaped at the vision of a Captain who 
had seen her on from Dover and who, while 
he waited to take her back, would be hover- 
ing just at the same distance at which, in 
Kensington Gardens, the companion of his 
walk had herself hovered. Of course, how- 





ever, instead of breathing any such guess she 
let Sir Claude reply ; all the more that his 
reply could contribute so much to her own 
present grandeur. " She won't be alone 
when she has a maid in attendance." 

Maisie had never before had so much of a 
retinue and she waited also to enjoy the ef- 
fect of it on her ladyship. " You mean the 
woman you brought from town? " Ida con- 
sidered. " The person at the house spoke of 
her in a way that scarcely made her out com- 
pany for my child." She spoke as if her 
child had never wanted, in her hands, for pro- 
digious company. But she as distinctly con- 
tinued to decline Sir Claude's. " Don't be an 
old goose," she said charmingly. " Let us 
alone." 

Before them, on the grass, he looked 
graver than Maisie at all now thought the 
occasion warranted. " I don't see why you 
can't say it before me." 

His wife smoothed one of her daughter's 
curls. "Say what, dear?" 

" Why, what you came to say." 

At this Maisie at last interposed ; sh ap- 
pealed to Sir Claude. " Do let her say it to 
me." 

He looked hard for a moment at his little 





friend. " How do you know what she may 
say?" 

" She must risk it," Ida remarked. 

" I only want to protect you," he continued 
to the child. 

" You want to protect yourself that 's 
what you mean," his wife replied. " Don't 
be afraid. I won't touch you." 

" She won't touch you she won't ! " 
Maisie declared. She felt by this time that 
she could really answer for it, and something 
of the emotion with which she had listened 
to the Captain came back to her. It made 
her so happy and so secure that she could 
positively patronize mamma. She did so in 
the Captain's very language. " She 's good, 
she 's good ! " she proclaimed. 

" Oh, Lord ! " Sir Claude, at this, ejacu- 
lated. He appeared to have emitted some 
sound of derision that was smothered, to 
Maisie's ears, by her being again embraced 
by his wife. Ida released her and held her 
off a little, looking at her with a very queer 
face. Then the child became aware that 
their companion had left them and that, from 
the face in question, a confirmatory remark 
had proceeded. 

" I am good, love," said her ladyship. 







XXI 

A GOOD deal of the rest of Ida's visit was 
devoted to explaining, as it were, so extra- 
ordinary a statement. This explanation was 
more copious than any she had yet indulged 
in, and as the summer twilight gathered and 
she kept her child in the garden she was con- 
ciliatory to a degree that let her need to 
arrange things a little perceptibly peep out. 
It was not merely that she explained; she 
almost conversed : all that was wanting to 
that was that she should have positively 
chattered a little less. It was really the oc- 
casion of Maisie's life on which her mother 
was to have had most to say to her. That 
alone was an implication of generosity and 
virtue, and no great stretch was required to 
make our young lady feel that she should 
best meet her and soonest have it over by 
simply seeming struck with the propriety of 
her contention. They sat together while the 
parent's gloved hand sometimes rested 
sociably on the child's and sometimes gave a 
corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a 
tress too thick ; and Maisie was conscious of 



the effort to keep out of her eyes the wonder 
with which they were occasionally moved to 
blink. Oh, there would have been things to 
blink at if one had let one's self go ; and it 
was lucky they were alone together, without 
Sir Claude or Mrs. Wix or even Mrs. Beale 
to catch an imprudent glance. Though pro- 
fuse and prolonged, her ladyship was not 
exhaustively lucid, and her account of her 
situation, so far as it could be called 
descriptive, was a muddle of inconsequent 
things, bruised fruit of an occasion she had 
rather too lightly affronted. None of them 
were really thought out, and some were even 
not wholly insincere. It was as if she had 
asked outright what better proof could have 
been wanted of her goodness and her great- 
ness than just this marvellous consent to give 
up what she had so cherished. It was as if 
she had said in so many words : " There 
have been things between us between Sir 
Claude and me which I needn't go into, 
you little nuisance, because you would n't 
understand them." It suited her to convey 
that Maisie had been kept, so far as she was 
concerned or could imagine, in a holy igno- 
rance and that she must take for granted a 
supreme simplicity. She turned this way 





and that in the predicament she had sought 
and from which she could neither retreat with 
grace nor emerge with credit; she draped 
herself in the tatters of her impudence, pos- 
tured to her utmost before the last little tri- 
angle of cracked glass to which so many 
fractures had reduced the polished plate of 
filial superstition. If neither Sir Claude nor 
Mrs. Wix was there this was perhaps all the 
more a pity : the scene had a style of its own 
that would have qualified it for presentation, 
especially at such a moment as that of her 
letting it betray that she quite did think her 
wretched offspring better placed with Sir 
Claude than in her own soiled hands. There 
was at any rate nothing scant either in her 
admissions or her perversions, the mixture of 
her fear of what Maisie might undiscoverably 
think and of the support she at the same time 
gathered from a necessity of selfishness and 
a habit of brutality. This habit flushed
