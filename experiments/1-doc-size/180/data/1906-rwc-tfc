knew what I was going to do. Only, I did think him 
personally possible — which made the expediency, the 
mercenary view of it easier to contemplate." 

She was becoming as frankly binital as she knew how 
to be, which made the revolt the more ominous. 

" You don't think you could endure him for an hour 
or two a day, Sylvia.'' " 

" It is not that," said the girl almost sullenly. 

" But " 

" I'm afraid of myself — call it inherited mischief if 
you like ! If I let a man do to me what Mr. Siward did 
when I was only engaged to Howard, what might I 
do " 

" You are not that sort ! " said Mrs. Ferrall bluntly. 
" Don't be exotic, Sylvia." 

" How do you know — if  don't know? Most girls 
are kissed; I — well I didn't expect to be. But I was! 
I tell you, Grace, I don't know what I am or shall be. 
I'm unsafe; I know that much." 

" It's moral and honest to realize it," said Mrs. Ferrall suavely ; " and in doing so you insure your own 
safety. Sylvia dear, I wish I hadn't meddled; I'm 
meddling some more I suppose when I say to you, don't 
give Howard his conge for the present. It is a horridly 
common thing to dwell upon, but Howard is too materially important to be cut adrift on the impulse of the 
moment." 

" I know it." 

" You are too clever not to. Consider the matter 
wisely, dispassionately, intelligently, dear; then if by 
April you simply can't stand it — talk the thing over 
with me again," she ended rather vaguely and wist- 
fully ; for it had been her heart's desire to wed Sylvia's 
beauty and Quarrier's fortune, and the suitability of the 





 

one for the other was apparent enough to make even 
sterner morahsts wobbly in their creed. Quarrier, as a 
detail of modern human architecture, she supposed might 
fit in somewhere, and took that for granted in laying the 
corner stone for her fairy palace which Sylvia was to 
inhabit. And now ! — oh, vexation ! — the neglected but 
essentially constructive detail of human architecture had 
buckled, knocking the dream palace and its princess and 
its splendour about her ears. 

" Things never happen in real life," she observed 
plaintively ; " only romances have plots where things 
work out. But we people in real life, we just go on and 
on in a badly constructed, plotless sort of way with no 
villains, no interesting situations, no climaxes, no ensemble. No, we grow old and irritable and meaner and 
meaner; we lose out good looks and digestions, and we 
die in hopeless discord with the unity required in a dollar 
and a half novel by a master of modern fiction." 

" But some among us amass fortunes," suggested 
Sylvia, laughing. 

" But we don't live happy ever after. Nobody ever 
had enough money in real life." 

" Some fall in love," observed Sylvia, musing. 

" And they are not content, silly ! " 

" Why ? Because nobody ever had enough love in 
real life," mocked Sylvia. 

" You have said it, child. That is the malady of the 
world, and nobody knows it until some pretty ninny 
like you babbles the truth. And that is why we care for 
those immortals in romance, those fortunate lovers who, 
in fable, are given and give enough of love; those 
magic shapes in verse and tale whose hearts are satisfied 
when the mad author of their being inks his last period 
and goes to dinner." 








Sylvia laughed awhile, then, chin on wrist, sat mus- 
ing there, muffled in her furs. 

" As for love, I think I should be moderate in the 
asking, in the giving. A little- — to flavour routine — 
would be sufficient for me I fancy." 

" You know so much about it," observed Mrs. Fcrrall 
ironically. 

" I am permitted to speculate, am I not ? " 

" Certainly. Only speculate in sound investments, 
dear." 

" How can you make a sound investment in love.'' 
Isn't it always sheerest speculation.'' " 

" Yes, that is why simple matrimony is usually a 
safer speculation than love." 

" Yes, but — love isn't matrimony." 

" Match that with its complementary platitude and 
you have the essence of modern fiction," observed Mrs. 
•Ferrall. " Love is a subject talked to death, which ex- 
plains the present shortage in the market I suppose. 
You're not in love and you don't miss it. Why culti- 
vate an artificial taste for it.'' If it ever comes natu- 
rally, you'll be astonished at your capacity for it, and 
the constant deterioration in quantity and quality of 
the visible supply. Goodness ! my epigrams make me 
yawn — or is it age and the ill humour of the aged when 
the porridge spills over on the family cat? " 

" I am the cat, I suppose," asked Sylvia, laughing. 

" Yes you are — and you go tearing away, back up, 
fur on end, leaving me by the fire with no porridge and 
only the aroma of the singeing fur to comfort me. 
. , . Still there's one thing to comfort me." 

"What.?" 

" Kitty-cats come back, dear." 

" Oh, I suppose so. . . . Do you believe I could in- 




 

duce him to wear his hair any way except pompadour? 
. . . and, dear, his beard is so dreadfully silky. Isn't 
there anything he could take for it ? " 

" Only a razor I'm afraid. Those long, thick, soft, 
eyelashes of his are ominous. Eyes of that sort ruin 
a man for my taste. He might just as reasonably wear 
my hat." 

" But he can't follow the fashions in eyes," laughed 
Sylvia. " Oh, this is atrocious of us — it is simply hor- 
rible to sit here and saj' such things. I am cold-blooded 
enough as it is — material enough, mean, covetous, con- 
temptible " 

" Dear ! " said Grace Ferrall mildly, " you are not 
choosing a husband ; you are choosing a career. To 
criticise his investments might be bad taste; to be able 
to extract what amusement you can out of Howard is 
a direct mercy from Heaven. Otherwise you'd go mad, 
you know." 

" Grace ! Do you wish me to marry him ? " 

" What is the alternative, dear.'' "
