Is it true that, when we look so anxiously for help 
from others, the virtue has gone out of ourselves ? 
I should hope not. 

As I leave Dublin, the houses grow larger and 
handsomer; and as I draw near the Avenue, the 
Mansard-roofs look down upon me with their dor- 
mer-windows, and welcome me back to the Ameri- 
can community. There are fences about all the 
houses, inclosing ampler and ampler dooryards ; the 
children, which had swarmed in the thriftless and 
unenlightened purlieus of Dublin, diminish in number 
and finally disappear ; the chickens have vanished ; 
and I hear — I hear the pensive music of the horse- 
car bells, which in some alien land, I am sure, would 
be as pathetic to me as the Ranz des Vaches to the 
Swiss or the bagpipes to the Highlander : in the 
desert, where the traveller seems to hear the famil- 
iar bells of his far-off church, this tinkle would haunt 
the absolute silence, and recall the exile's fancy to 

Charlesbridge ; and perhaps in the mocking mirage 
he would behold an airy horse-car track, and a 
phantasmagoric horse-car moving slowly along the 
edge of the horizon, with spectral passengers closely 
packed inside and oyerflowing either platform. 

But before I reach the Avenue, Dublin calls to 
me yet again, in the figure of an old, old man, wear- 
ing the clothes of other times, and a sort of ancestral 
roimd hat. In the act of striking a match he asks 
me the time of day, and, applying the fire to his 
pipe, he returns me his thanks in a volume of words 
and smoke. What a wrinkled and unshorn old man ! 
Can age and neglect do so much for any of us ? This 
ruinous person was associated with a hand-cart as 
decrepit as himself, but not nearly so cheerful ; for 
though he spoke up briskly with a spirit uttered firom 
far within the wrinkles and the stubble, the cart had 
preceded him with a very lugubrious creak. It 
groaned, in fact, under a load of tin cans, and I was 
to learn from the old man that there was, and had 
been, in his person, for thirteen years, such a thing 
in the. world as a peddler of buttermilk, and that 
these cans were now filled with that pleasant drink. 
They did not invite me to prove their contents, being 
cans that apparently passed their vacant moments in 
stables and even manure-heaps, and that looked 
somehow emulous of that old man's stubble and 
wrinkles. I bought nothing, but I left the old ped- 
dler .well content, seated upon a thill of his cart, 
smoking tranquilly, and filling the keen spring even- 
ing air with fumes which it dispersed abroad, and 
made to itself a pleasant incense of. 



 

I left him a whole epoch behind, as I entered the 
Avenue and lounged hpmeward along the stately 
street. Above the station it is far more picturesque 
than it is below, and the magnificent elms that 
shadow it might well have looked, in their sapling- 
hood, upon the British straggling down the country- 
road from the Concord fight; and there are some 
ancient houses yet standing that must have been 
filled with exultation at the same spectacle. Poor 
old revolutionaries I they would never have believed 
that their descendants would come to love the Eng- 
lish as we do. 

The season has advanced rapidly during my prog- 
ress irom Dublin to the Avenue ; and by the time I 
reach the famous old tavern, not far from the station, 
it is a Sunday morning of early summer, and the 
yellow sunlight falls upon a body of good comrades 
who are grooming a marvelous number of piebald 
steeds about the stable-doors. By token of these 
beasts — which always look so much more like works 
of art than of nature — I know that there is to be a 
circus somewhere very soon ; and the gay bills pasted 
all over the stable-front tell me that there are to be 
two performances at the Port on the morrow. The 
grooms talk nothing and joke nothing but horse at 
their labor ; and their life seems such a low, igno- 
rant, happy life, that the secret nomad lurking in 
every respectable and stationary personality stirs 
within me and struggles to strike hands of fellowship 
with them. They lead a sort of pastoral existence 
in our age of railroads ; they wander over the con- 



 

tinent with their great caravan, and everywhere 
pursue the summer from south to North and from 
North to South again ; in the mild forenoons they 
groom their herds, and in the afternoons they doze 
under their wagons, indifferent to the tumult of the 
crowd within and without the mighty canvas near 
them, — doze face downwards on the bruised, sweet- 
smelling grass ; and in the starry midnight rise and 
strike their tents, and set forth again over the still 
country roads, to take the next village on the mor- 
row with the blaze and splendor of their " Grand 
Entree." The triumphal chariot in which the musi- 
cians are borne at the head of the procession is com- 
posed, as I perceive by the bills, of four colossal gilt 
swans, set tail to tail, with lifted wings and curving 
necks j but the chariot, as I behold it beside the sta- 
ble, is mysteriously draped in white canvas, through 
which its gilding glitters only here and there. And 
does it inove thus shrouded in the company's wander- 
ings from place to place, and is the precious spottiness 
of the piebalds then hidden under envious drapery ? 
O happy grooms, — not clean as to shirts, nor espe- 
cially neat in your conversation, but displaying a 
Wealth of art in India-ink upon your manly chests 
and the swelling muscles of your arms, and speaking 
in every movement your freedom from all conven- 
tional gyves and shackles, " seid UTmchlungen ! " — 
in spirit ; for the rest, you are rather too damp, and 
seem to have applied your sudsy sponges too impar- 
tially to your own trousers and the horses' legs to 
receive an actual embrace from a dilettante vaga- 
bond. 



 

The old tavern is old only comparatively ; but in 
our new and change&l life it is already quaint. It 
is very long, and low-studded in either story, with a 
row of windows in the roof, and a great porch, fiir- 
nished with benches, running the whole length of 
the ground-floor. Perhaps because they take the 
dust of the street too freely, or because the guests 
find it more social and comfortable to gather in-doors 
in the wide, low-ceiled office, the benches are not 
worn, nor particularly whittled. The room has the 
desolate air characteristic of offices which have once 
been bar-rooms ; but no doubt, on a winter's night, 
there is talk worth listening to there, of flocks and 
herds and horse-trades, from the drovers and cattle- 
market men who patronize the tavern; and the 
artistic temperament, at least, could feel no regret if 
that sepulchrally penitent bar-room then developed 
a secret capacity for the wickedness that once boldly 
glittered behind the counter in rows of decanters. 

The house was formerly renowned for its suppers, 
of which all that was learned or gifted in the old 
college town of Charlesbridge used to partake ; and 
I have heard lips which breathe the loftiest song and 
the sweetest humor — let alone being "dewy with 
the Greek of Plato " — smacked regretfully over 
the memory of those suppers' roast and broiled. No 
such suppers, they say, are cooked in the world any 
more ; and I am somehow made to feel that their 
passing away is connected with the decay of good 
literature. 

I hope it may be very long before the predestined 

French-roof villa occupies the tavern's site, and turns 
into lawns and gardens its wide-spreading cattle-pens, 
and removes the great bam that now shows its broad, 
low gable to the street. This is yet older and 
quainter-looking than the tavern itself ; it is mighty 
capacious, and gives a still profounder impression of 
vastness with its shed, of which the roof slopes 
southward down almost to a man's height from the 
ground, and shelters a row of mangers, running 
back half the length of the stable, and serving in 
former times for the baiting of such beasts as could 
not be provided for within. But the halcyon days 
of the cattle-market are past (though you may still
