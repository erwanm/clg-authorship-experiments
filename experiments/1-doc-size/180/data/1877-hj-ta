should not enjoy Paris.”

“Oh, I do enjoy it!” said Newman, good-naturedly. “I’m much obliged to
you.”

“Honestly speaking,” M. de Bellegarde went on, “there is something
absurd to me in hearing myself make you these offers. They represent
a great deal of goodwill, but they represent little else. You are a
successful man and I am a failure, and it’s a turning of the tables to
talk as if I could lend you a hand.”

“In what way are you a failure?” asked Newman.

“Oh, I’m not a tragical failure!” cried the young man with a laugh.
“I have fallen from a height, and my fiasco has made no noise. You,
evidently, are a success. You have made a fortune, you have built up an
edifice, you are a financial, commercial power, you can travel about
the world until you have found a soft spot, and lie down in it with
the consciousness of having earned your rest. Is not that true? Well,
imagine the exact reverse of all that, and you have me. I have done
nothing--I can do nothing!”

“Why not?”

“It’s a long story. Some day I will tell you. Meanwhile, I’m right, eh?
You are a success? You have made a fortune? It’s none of my business,
but, in short, you are rich?”

“That’s another thing that it sounds foolish to say,” said Newman. “Hang
it, no man is rich!”

“I have heard philosophers affirm,” laughed M. de Bellegarde, “that
no man was poor; but your formula strikes me as an improvement. As a
general thing, I confess, I don’t like successful people, and I find
clever men who have made great fortunes very offensive. They tread on
my toes; they make me uncomfortable. But as soon as I saw you, I said
to myself. ‘Ah, there is a man with whom I shall get on. He has
the good-nature of success and none of the morgue; he has not our
confoundedly irritable French vanity.’ In short, I took a fancy to you.
We are very different, I’m sure; I don’t believe there is a subject on
which we think or feel alike. But I rather think we shall get on, for
there is such a thing, you know, as being too different to quarrel.”

“Oh, I never quarrel,” said Newman.

“Never! Sometimes it’s a duty--or at least it’s a pleasure. Oh, I have
had two or three delicious quarrels in my day!” and M. de Bellegarde’s
handsome smile assumed, at the memory of these incidents, an almost
voluptuous intensity.

With the preamble embodied in his share of the foregoing fragment of
dialogue, he paid our hero a long visit; as the two men sat with their
heels on Newman’s glowing hearth, they heard the small hours of the
morning striking larger from a far-off belfry. Valentin de Bellegarde
was, by his own confession, at all times a great chatterer, and on this
occasion he was evidently in a particularly loquacious mood. It was a
tradition of his race that people of its blood always conferred a favor
by their smiles, and as his enthusiasms were as rare as his civility was
constant, he had a double reason for not suspecting that his friendship
could ever be importunate. Moreover, the flower of an ancient stem as
he was, tradition (since I have used the word) had in his temperament
nothing of disagreeable rigidity. It was muffled in sociability and
urbanity, as an old dowager in her laces and strings of pearls. Valentin
was what is called in France a gentilhomme, of the purest source, and
his rule of life, so far as it was definite, was to play the part of a
gentilhomme. This, it seemed to him, was enough to occupy comfortably
a young man of ordinary good parts. But all that he was he was by
instinct and not by theory, and the amiability of his character was so
great that certain of the aristocratic virtues, which in some aspects
seem rather brittle and trenchant, acquired in his application of them
an extreme geniality. In his younger years he had been suspected of low
tastes, and his mother had greatly feared he would make a slip in the
mud of the highway and bespatter the family shield. He had been treated,
therefore, to more than his share of schooling and drilling, but his
instructors had not succeeded in mounting him upon stilts. They could
not spoil his safe spontaneity, and he remained the least cautious and
the most lucky of young nobles. He had been tied with so short a rope in
his youth that he had now a mortal grudge against family discipline.
He had been known to say, within the limits of the family, that,
light-headed as he was, the honor of the name was safer in his hands
than in those of some of its other members, and that if a day ever came
to try it, they should see. His talk was an odd mixture of almost boyish
garrulity and of the reserve and discretion of the man of the world,
and he seemed to Newman, as afterwards young members of the Latin races
often seemed to him, now amusingly juvenile and now appallingly mature.
In America, Newman reflected, lads of twenty-five and thirty have old
heads and young hearts, or at least young morals; here they have young
heads and very aged hearts, morals the most grizzled and wrinkled.

“What I envy you is your liberty,” observed M. de Bellegarde, “your wide
range, your freedom to come and go, your not having a lot of people, who
take themselves awfully seriously, expecting something of you. I live,”
 he added with a sigh, “beneath the eyes of my admirable mother.”

“It is your own fault; what is to hinder your ranging?” said Newman.

“There is a delightful simplicity in that remark! Everything is to
hinder me. To begin with, I have not a penny.”

“I had not a penny when I began to range.”

“Ah, but your poverty was your capital. Being an American, it was
impossible you should remain what you were born, and being born poor--do
I understand it?--it was therefore inevitable that you should become
rich. You were in a position that makes one’s mouth water; you looked
round you and saw a world full of things you had only to step up to and
take hold of. When I was twenty, I looked around me and saw a world with
everything ticketed ‘Hands off!’ and the deuce of it was that the ticket
seemed meant only for me. I couldn’t go into business, I couldn’t make
money, because I was a Bellegarde. I couldn’t go into politics, because
I was a Bellegarde--the Bellegardes don’t recognize the Bonapartes. I
couldn’t go into literature, because I was a dunce. I couldn’t marry a
rich girl, because no Bellegarde had ever married a roturière, and it
was not proper that I should begin. We shall have to come to it, yet.
Marriageable heiresses, de notre bord, are not to be had for nothing;
it must be name for name, and fortune for fortune. The only thing I
could do was to go and fight for the Pope. That I did, punctiliously,
and received an apostolic flesh-wound at Castlefidardo. It did neither
the Holy Father nor me any good, that I could see. Rome was doubtless a
very amusing place in the days of Caligula, but it has sadly fallen off
since. I passed three years in the Castle of St. Angelo, and then came
back to secular life.”

“So you have no profession--you do nothing,” said Newman.

“I do nothing! I am supposed to amuse myself, and, to tell the truth, I
have amused myself. One can, if one knows how. But you can’t keep it up
forever. I am good for another five years, perhaps, but I foresee that
after that I shall lose my appetite. Then what shall I do? I think I
shall turn monk. Seriously, I think I shall tie a rope round my waist
and go into a monastery. It was an old custom, and the old customs were
very good. People understood life quite as well as we do. They kept
the pot boiling till it cracked, and then they put it on the shelf
altogether.”

“Are you very religious?” asked Newman, in a tone which gave the inquiry
a grotesque effect.

M. de Bellegarde evidently appreciated the comical element in the
question, but he looked at Newman a moment with extreme soberness. “I am
a very good Catholic. I respect the Church. I adore the blessed Virgin.
I fear the Devil.”

“Well, then,” said Newman, “you are very well fixed. You have got
pleasure in the present and religion in the future; what do you complain
of?”

“It’s a part of one’s pleasure to complain. There is something in your
own circumstances that irritates me. You are the first man I have ever
envied. It’s singular, but so it is. I have known many men who, besides
any factitious advantages that I may possess, had money and brains into
the bargain; but somehow they have never disturbed my good-humor. But
you have got something that I should have liked to have. It is not
money, it is not even brains--though no doubt yours are excellent. It is
not your six feet of height, though I should have rather liked to be a
couple of inches taller. It’s a sort of air you have of being thoroughly
at home in the world. When I was a boy, my father told me that it was
by such an air as that that people recognized a Bellegarde. He called my
attention to it. He didn’t advise me to cultivate it; he said that as we
grew up it always came of itself. I supposed it had come to me, because
I think I have always had the feeling. My place in life was made for me,
and it seemed easy to occupy it. But you who, as I understand it,
have made your own place, you who, as you told us the other day, have
manufactured wash-tubs--you strike me, somehow, as a man who stands at
his ease, who looks at things from a height. I fancy you going about the
world like a man traveling on a railroad in which he owns a large amount
of stock. You make me feel as if I had missed something. What is it?”

“It is the proud consciousness of honest toil--of having manufactured a
few wash-tubs,” said Newman, at once jocose and serious.

“Oh no; I have seen men who had done even more, men who had made not
only wash-tubs, but soap--strong-smelling yellow soap, in great bars;
and they never made me the least uncomfortable.”

“Then it’s the privilege of being an American citizen,” said Newman.
“That sets a man up.”

“Possibly,” rejoined M. de Bellegarde. “But I am forced to say that I
have seen a great many American citizens who didn’t seem at all set up
