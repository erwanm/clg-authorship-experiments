"Perhaps he might have been troubled in his last 
moments ; but if he repented he should not have been 
ashamed to confess his sin. It is either a wrong on his 
part or a charity on hers." 

" Papa," Baid Madge, " we have had many troubles and 



 

misfortunes, but it seems as if the worst might be past. I 
may be hai'd in my judgment, but I do not want to accept 
one penny from her. I feel like Philip if it came to us 
as a just due, I should receive it thankfully, but otherwise 
I would rather teach school all the days of my life than 
rest under an obligation." 

" Eleanor," said her father, " what do you think of the 
matter?" 

Eleanor flushed warmly. 

" I am not so ashamed of poverty," she replied, in a 
clear, proud voice, "that I would willingly accept such a 
favor. It would be only a partial restitution, after all 
the money without any cause or explanation." 

" Did you promise anything, papa ? " asked Jessie. 

' No. Indeed, she wished me to consult some of you, 
though she was very urgent that it should be accepted in 
the end." 

" It is such an odd, quixotic idea ; and I do not like it, 
altogether." 

" She gave me a week in which to consider the matter." 

" Then we shall have plenty of time to resolve," said 
Madge, with a half smile. 

" What is she like ?" was Jessie's next question. " Did 
you ever meet her, mamma ? " 

"I used to see her occasionally, though Clement was 
better acquainted with her than any of the rest." 

"Mr. Stanhope never appeared particularly fond of her," 
said Mr. Ashburton, " but I think she must have been 
devoted to him." 

It was a subject which occupied them all the evening, 
both in thought and word. After Mr. and Mrs. Ashbur- 
ton had retired, the younger ones still kept engrossed. 
Various motives swayed them, it is true, and perhaps they 
all fought harder against the proposal because it was some- 
thing of a secret temptation. They could see what a 
tomfort even ten thousand dollars would be to them just 
now. 





' Yet we have to come back to the old idea," said Philip. 
"Mr. Stanhope is the only one who knows whether he 
wronged father or not. I must confess that I incline to 
the belief that he did ; but if he never admitted this, the 
money is simply a gift from Miss Stnnhope, and we are 
not poor enough to take that." 

"No," they all answered, with quivering breath. For 
to Madge it seemed to come too late. A year or two ago 
it might have given her happiness ; now it would be mere 
physical comfort ; and indolence or cessation from work 
was what she felt she could hardly endure, until after she 
had fought her way out to peace. 

Eleanor shrank from it as a snare. This time her eyes 
should not be blinded nor her judgment warped by the 
glitter of gold. No word of hers should sway the others 
against their will, or humble her father into any con- 
cession. 

To Philip it was a matter of pride. They had gone 
through the worst of their misfortunes, he fully believed, 
and he would not accept this aid from a stranger unless it 
could be made to appear that it was their right. 

Before the week ended they received a note from Misa 
Stanhope asking them to appoint an interview whenever 
it would be most convenient to see them all together. 
This could only be in the evening. 

She came in a carriage, and unattended. The Ashbur- 
tons had discussed the subject until they were all of one 
mind, and perhaps, in their desire to be perfectly just, their 
"judgment leaned towards severity rather than mercy. 

Mrs. Ashburton met the young girl, who faltered a little 
on the threshold, and held out her hand in token of amity. 
But they could never guess the pang that went to the 
heart of this stranger as she gave a quick glance at the 
unsympathetic faces. 

She took the proffered seat, and threw aside her heavy 
veil. Young and lovely, with no trace of care nothing 



 

but refinement, cultivation, and ease. She might have 
" lain in the roses and lilies of life," for any mark her 
anguish had left upon her. 

There was an awkward silence. Rose Stanhope wished 
that she had trusted herself, first of all, to Mrs. Ashbur- 
ton's motherly kindness. 

" When I called before, I left a proposal with you, Mr. 
Ashburton," she began, slowly. " I wished you to consider 
it with your family " and the soft voice came to an 
embarrassed pause. 

" I shall depute my son Philip to answer for me. He 
represents the opinion of all, I believe." 

She turned with a quick, deprecating glance, while 
Philip Ashburton responded with a bow. 

" We have discussed it with all necessary deliberation 
and patience," he answered in a rather hesitating tone ; 
not because he wavered in his decision, but talking among 
themselves was quite different from talking with her. 

" I hope you have that you do agree with me," she 
responded in tremulous earnestness. 

"Miss Stanhope," and Philip's tone fell to its softest 
key, " your generous offer surprised us greatly. I think 
you have hardly given the matter due consideration." 

"Yes, I have," she interrupted. "It is no sudden whim, 
but rather a settled purpose." 

" With us the question resolves itself into two points : 
it is either a gift or a fancied restitution. We are not 
sufficiently needy to be willing to accept such a costly gift 
from a stranger. The story of our poverty and misfor- 
tune may have awakened your romantic interest ; but if it 
is charity merely, there are hundreds of others more neces- 
sitated. We have youth, health, and employment, and 
pardon me if I add too much true pride to become the 
pensioners of any person." 

"It is not that;" and she gave an appealing glance 
around. 





" It can only be a point of duty if it was left in yoai 
charge as some sacred behest." 

She flushed deeply, and began to remove her glove with 
nervous fingers. 

" Papa spoke of you all in his last days. If he had 
known that he was so near to death, I think he would 
have left some charges. But it was quite sudden at the 
last." 

They all felt that the subject was a very delicate one. 
Only Philip's straightforward honesty could have carried 
him through. 

" If there had been any mistake," he shrank from
