judicious system of suggestion and inquiry, might be led 
perhaps to reveal something without knowing that she revealed anything ; but the minister disliked that way of 
getting information when it could be dispensed with. He 
had enough knowledge to act upon ; for the rest he was 
patient and could wait. 

That night he knew Diana did not sleep. He himself 
passed the night again in his study, though not in the 




struggles of the night before. He was very calm, steadfast, 
diligent ; that is, his usual self entirely. And, watching 
her without her knowing he watched, he knew by her 
breathing and her changes of position that it was a night 
of no rest on her part. Once he saw she was sitting up in 
the bed ; once he saw that she had left it and was sitting 
by the window. 

The next day the minister did not leave home. He had 
no more urgent business anywhere, he thought, than there. 
And he found Diana did not make up by day what she 
had lost by night ; she was always staring wide awake 
whenever he went into the room ; and he went whenever 
there was a cup of tea or a cup of broth to be taken to 
her, for he prepared it and carried it to her himself. 

It happened in the course ot the afternoon that Prince 
and the old little green wagon came jogging along and 
landed Mrs. Starling at the minister's door. This was a 
very rare event ; Mrs. Starling came at long intervals to see 
her daughter, and made then a call which nobody enjoyed. 
To-day Miss Collins hailed the sight of her. Indeed if the 
distance had not been too much, Miss Collins would have 
walked down to carry the tidings of Diana's indisposition ; 
for like a true gossip she scented mischief where she could 
see none. The minister would let her have nothing to do 
with his wife ; and, if he were out of the house and she 
got a chance, she could make nothing of Diana. Nothing certain ; but nothing either that lulled her suspicions. 
Now, with Mrs. Starling, there was no telling what she 
might get at. The lady dismounted and came into the 
kitchen, looking about her, as always, with sharp eyes. 

' How d'ye do,' said she. ' Where is Diana ? ' 

' I'm glad to see ye, Mis' Starling, and that's a fact,' 
said the handmaid. ' I was 'most a mind to walk down to 
your place to-day.' 



' What's the matter ? Where's Diana ? ' 

' Wall, she's up stairs. She hain't been down now for 
two days.' 

' What's the reason ? ' 

' Wall sun 'thin' ain't right ; and I don't think the minister's clear what it is; and ain't. She was took as sud- 
den you never see nothin' suddener she come in here to 
fix a dish o' eggs for supper that she's mighty particler 
about, and don't think no one can cook eggs but herself ; 
and I was talkin' and tellin' her about my old experiences 
in the post office and she went up stairs and took to her 
bed ; and she hain't left it sen. Now ain't that queer ? 
'Cause she didn't say nothin' ailed her ; not a word ; only 
she went up and took to her bed ; and she doos look queer 
at you, that I will say. Mebbe it's fever a comin' on.' 

There was a minute or two's silence. Mrs. Starling did 
not immediately find her tongue. 

' What have the post office and your stories got to do 
with it ? ' she asked harshly. ' I should like to know.' 

' Yes ' said Miss Collins, drawing out the word with 
affable intonation, ' that's what beats me. What should 
they ? But la ! the post office is queer ; that's what I always 
said. Everybody gits into it ; and ef you're there, o' course 
you can't help knowin' things.' 

' You weren't in the post office ! ' said Mrs. Starling. 
'It was none oiyour business.' 

' Warn't I ? ' said Miss Collins. ' Don't you mind better'n that, Mis' Starling ? I mind you comin', and I mind 
givin' you your letters too ; I mind some 'ticlar big ones, 
that had stamps enough on to set up a shop. La, 'tain't no 
harm. Miss Gunn, she used to feel a sort o' sameness 
about allays takin' in and givin' out, and then she'd come 
into the kitchen and make cake mebbe, and send me to 



 

tend the letters and the folks. And then it was as good as 
a play to me. Don't you never git tired o' trottin' a mile 
in a bushel, Mis' Starlin' ? So I was jest a tellin' Diany ' 

' Where's the minister ? ' 

' Most likely he's where she is up stairs. He won't 
let nobody else do a hand's turn for her. He takes up 
every cup of tea, and he spreads every bit of bread and butter ; and he tastes the broths ; you'd think he was anythin' 
in the world but a minister ; he tastes the broth, and he 
calls for the salt and pepper, and he stirs and he tastes ; 
and then you never see a man make such a fuss, leastways 
I never did he'll have a white napkin and spread over a 
tray, and the cup on it, and saucer too, for he won't have 
the cup 'thout the saucer, and then carry it off. Was your 
husband like that, Mis' Starling ? he was a minister, I've 
heerd tell.' 

Mrs. Starling turned short about without answering and 
went up stairs. 

She found the minister there, as Miss Collins had 
opined she would ; but she paid little attention to him. He 
was just drawing the curtains over a window where the sun- 
light came in too glaringly. As he had done this, and 
turned, he was a spectator of the meeting between mother 
and child. It was peculiar. Mrs. Starling advanced to 
the foot of the bed, carr.e no nearer, but stood there looking down at her daughter. And Diana's eyes fastened on 
hers with a look of calm, cold intelligence. It was intense 
enough, yet there was no passion in it ; I suppose there 
was too much despair ; however, it was as I said, keen and 
intent, and it held Mrs. Starling's eyes, like a vice. Those 
Mr. Masters could not see ; the lady's back was towards 
him ; but he saw how Diana's eyes pinioned her and how 
strangely still Mrs. Starling stood. 



 

' What's the matter with you ? ' she said harshly at last. 

' You ought to know,' said Diana, not moving her eyes. 

' I ain't a conjuror,' Mrs. Starling returned with a sort 
of snort. ' What makes you look at me like that ? ' 

Diana gave a short sharp laugh. ' How can you look 
at me ? ' she said. ' I know all about it, mother. 

Mrs. Starling with a sudden determination went round 
to the head of the bed and put out her hand to feel Diana's pulse. Dian-a shrank away from her. 

' Keep off ! ' she cried. ' Basil, Basil, don't let her 
touch me.' 

' She is out of her head,' said Mrs. Starling, turning to 
her son-in-Law, and speaking half loud. ' I had better stay 
and sit up with her.' 

' No,' cried Diana. ' I don't want you. Basil, don't 
let her stay. Basil, Basil ! ' 

The cry was urgent and pitiful. Her husband came 
near, arranged the pillows, for she had started half up ; and 
putting her gently back upon them, said in his calm tones, 
' Be quiet, Di ; you command here. Mrs. Starling, shall 
we go down stairs ? ' 

Mrs. Starling this time complied without making any 
objection ; but as she reached the bottom she gave vent to 
her opinion. 

' You are spoiling her ! ' 

' Really I should like to have the chance.' 

' What do you mean by that ? ' 

' Just the words. I should like to spoil Di. She has 
never had much of that sort of bad influence.' 

' That sounds very weak, to me,' said Mrs. Starling.
