with some cooling ointment, brushed her 
hair, and changed her dress, when Addie 
Strong came in. 

‘ ' I want you to come over to our house 
to tea to-morrow,’’ she said. '‘My two 
cousins from Newton are to spend the 
day. Gracie plays so beautifully, you 
know, and you are so fond of music. I 
shall not ask anyone else.” 

"And I can’t come. It is too bad. 
Oh, dear!” and she had half a mind to 
send for Cousin Jane, cross old thing 
that she was. And maybe she wouldn’t 
let her go. Cousin Jane thought so 
much liberty was the ruin of children 
nowadays. No, she could not go— that 
was all about it. 

Addie was very sorry, and Bessie could 
have cried, but there was no help for it. 
She walked a short distance down the 


 


street with her, and paused at the gate 
to speak to Sophie Lewis. Could they 
not come over a little while to-morrow 
afternoon? 

Of course they would. And if Mrs. 
Collins was away, they would have such 
fun. 

"What is it? Can’t I come, too? 
Don’t shut me out of fun,” said Carrie 
Lanliam’s gay voice. 

'If you like,” said Bessie, thinking 
that she really could not help asking 
her, and rather glad that it had so 
happened. 

‘‘We’ll have a regular frolic in the 
barn. Your barn is such a nice, clean 
place. ’ ’ 

Mdien she reached home she found that 
Freddy had been digging dirt out of the 
path and carrying it up on the porch, 


wliere with a cup of water he was making 
pies. 

‘'Oh, Freddy, jon had boy! Mother 
has forbidden you to bring sand up on 
this iDorch. And look at your clean 
apron! Oh, you disobedient, aggravat- 
ing— there, take that, and clear out with 
your blocks!’' 

She gave him a hard slap in her vexa- 
tion. 

Idl tell mother — you see!'’ and 
Freddy cried more with anger than pain. 

won’t pick up a single block, you 
ugly old thing!” 

‘‘You deserve a good whipping, that’s 
what you do!” and for a moment Bessie 
would have been delighted to administer 
it. But Mrs. Collins had forbidden the 
elder children to strike the younger ones, 
no matter what the provocation might he. 


 


So Bessie swept the porch and then 
wiped it over with the mop. It was time 
to make np the fire again. She was cross 
to Freddy, ont of temper, and as a nat- 
ural result everything went wrong. 
Supper was a little late, but so was her 
father, and Dick never reached home 
until seven. 

She went to bed shortly after her work 
was done, for she was tired and out of 
spirits. Housekeeping had not been the 
brilliant success she imagined it. But 
Freddy was so much trouble. Never 
mind, to-morrow afternoon he would he 
gone, and she and the girls could have a 
good time. 

Her father had the kettle boiling in 
the morning before he called her. The 
smart and ache was out of her fin- 
gers, and she felt rested. Everything 

 


went smoothly at breakfast, only Dick 
said— 

"You need not have taken so much 
pains setting my drawer aside, Bessie. 
I had to laugh this morning when I could 
not find a single thing where I had put it. 
But I suppose housekeeping was a great 
treat to you, ’ ’ and he laughed. 

Bessie flushed. He would never know 
the rest, but if she could only have the 
book to read. 

'If that’s a specimen, you’ll be splen- 
did, Bessie, neat enough for an old 
maid.” 

Bessie turned away to listen to her 
father. Could she not boil some beets? 
and he would send in a steak for dinner, 
and— was there anything else? 

Jamie stayed at home all the morning 
and helped to amuse Freddy. Bessie at- 

 


tended to her sleeping rooms, and then 
went to the kitchen. After washing the 
dishes she concluded to try making some 
cookies. They would he so good to eat 
this afternoon when the girls came. 

She had often helped her mother on 
baking days, but it was somewhat differ- 
ent to plan everything for herself. Bes- 
sie was not quite as wise as she fancied, 
though she often imagined that she could 
improve upon her mother’s ways. She 
poured in her milk without any measure- 
ment, and then had to use more flour, 
making twice the quantity of dough that 
she meant to. She could not remember 
whether she had put in salt or not, and, 
without thinking to taste, ran for some 
more. They were rolled out, cut, and 
placed in the pans. 

‘‘ I ’ll make a cake of the rest, ’’she said 


 


to herself. ‘‘I can’t bother cutting out 
so much. ’ ’ 

She put them in the oven and began to 
tidy up her kitchen. What a sight of 
work there was to do, after all! Beans 
to shell and Dick had asked for mashed 
potatoes. Oh, her cookies must be 
done ! 

They were hard and dried, but not the
