SO many nice things ! And you may count on one friend 
who will be glad to get you back. Good-by till then.” 

He stooped suddenly, and, before I could prevent, had 
kissed me. I bit my lip with pain and anger. I did not 
like being taken possession of, whether I would or not. 
Unless he was to be my lover, he had no right, and none 
anyhow, until I gave it. Yet I could not quite decide the 
matter. Perhaps no young girl can at once dismiss a 
man’s regard from her mind, unless there is something 
positively distasteful in it. This only had the crime of 
being intensely common-place. 

Archie and I reached New Haven safely ; and Miss 
Georgie came to escort us home, — a pretty bowery nest 
a little in the suburbs, with a great roomy porch, and 
lovely flower-garden. Mrs. Curtis was sweet and cordial. 
She had been a widow ; and her daughter by her first 
marriage, Mrs. Danforth, was Imng at home, with her 
two babies, perfect cherubs. Mr. Danforth was a profess- 
or of chemistry, a fine-looking, scholarly man, of whom I 
felt a little afraid at first. Georgie had two younger 
brothers. 

Archie said good-by, and was off. We settled ourselves 
to a most dehghtful course of visiting. There were rides 
and walks, and going to the salt water, beside a three- 
days’ excursion in a yacht. Then there was a visit to 
be made in the country at grandmother’s ; and altogether 
I spent three charming weeks. 

I came to hke Mr. Danforth so much ! He was the 
embodiment of refinement and manliness, the most de- 
voted of husbands, the tenderest of fathers, with a large, 
generous mind, and the charm of being very entertaining. 
He did not unbend simply because you were a young girl ; 
rather he seemed to reach out his hand and draw you up 
to his level. I think now that it unwittingly tinctured all 
my life to meet this man, who gave me a larger insight 
into what men might be. If Heaven had in store for me 
any such, how patient! v T would wait ! 


 


But, as an offset, here was Georgie with a lover, — a 
pretty pink-and-white young man, good-humored, common- 
place, with a certain society polish, a nice tenor voice, 
and a bright way that affected wit. How could she com- 
pare the two, and be content? 

There was about her the sweet shjmess, the delicate 
delight of love, that attested its sincerity and truth, and 
gave promise of a delicious blossoming. Mr. and Mrs. 
Danforth seemed to accept the young man cordially. 

It appeared to me that Georgie really was much my 
superior, — a fine musician, a decided genius for sketching, 
and a gift for poetry that I really envied. Some very 
pretty verses had found their way into print, and been 
actually remunerated, though I think she wrote them 
because she liked it, not for either fame or money. So 
her ideal of life would end in this ! Was I too exigeantf 

I came home much refreshed to take up my small 
burthen of life. But a surprise and sorrow met me on 
the very threshold. 

The war was now assuming a serious aspect. Our 
reverses had fired the national heart, and given us an 
insight into the temper of our adversaries. Our brave 
boy Archie felt called to go. I cannot repeat our argu- 
ments, for my heart is still sore : yet some one’s sons and 
brothers had to go ; and why not ours ? 

Martha and her husband had returned. He had sold 
his farm, and made a little money, and, after some consid- 
eration, resolved to go into business with uncle Frank. 
He purchased a house, and aunt Hetty took the second 
floor ; both parties keeping house separately. Martha had 
so little work to do, that she took in some dress-making. 
The Millers were wonderfully pleased with Stephen’s 
smart wife. Martha said, with an emphatic toss of the 
head, “ that they meant to be rich folks before theydied.” 
How odd it was, that she never seemed to think sickness 
or misfortune might overtake them ! 





James- Miller called a few days before I came home, 
and seemed quite disappointed, Theo thought. Martha 
gave a tea-party, but I did not go : we were too full 
of sorrow for Archie. He did not come again, and I 
wondered a little. Was I glad, or sorry? 

Well, perhaps no woman likes to feel that a man’s 
preference for her is so short-lived. Still I felt that it 
was best. I could not marry him, surely. 

Archie was not killed in his first battle, and we took 
heart. I had been promoted, too, and received fifty dol- 
lars more salary. Business was dreadfully dull, except in 
army equipments. Papa was very much worried, as he 
had some heavy notes to pay. 

“We must manage just as closely as we can,” said 
mamma. “ There used to be a little coming from Arcliie ; 
but we must do without that now, and send him a few 
comforts, the pay of a private is such a very little ! ” 

One night late in October I went to Martha’s to meet 
a few friends, her sister being one. James came in to 
tea. He was quite distant at first. Was there a spice of 
latent coquetry in me ? I wondered if I could bring him 
back. 

However, aunt Hetty seemed determined to make us 
cordial. There was no Archie to escort me ; so, when I 
rose to go, Mr. Miller proflered his services. 

“ If you will just put me in the car,” I said, “ I shah 
be obhged. I could not think of taking you on such a 
long, needless journey.” 

“ I suppose you had a very nice time last summer,” he 
said quite coldly as we walked along, “you staid such 
a while.” 

“ It was delightful.” 

There was an awkward pause, and then my car came 
along : so I expressed my obhgation politely. 

“ I hope I shall see you some time again,” he ventured 
to say. 


 


“ I am not going to run away,” I retoned laughingly. 
“ I don’t have any more holidays until Christmas.” 

I had salved my conscience. I had not asked him to visit 
me ; and, if he did come, it would be at his own peril. I 
think I liked him the better for not being too obtusely blind. 

A week later I received a note from him. There was 
to be a concert at Trevor Hall with a celebrated singer, 
and he had two tickets with reserved seats. If I could 
not go, would I reply accordingly? but, if I could, he 
would call for me without further trouble. 

I wanted to hear Madame L so much ! Could I 

say no ? Other girls went out with gentlemen whom they 
did not marry. How could I be sm’e that he meant sucJi 
a conclusion? Was it not rather bold in me to imagine it ? 

I did not answer. Mr. Miller called quite early, and we 
went to the concert. It was enchanting. The next week 
Wendell Phillips was to lecture. Would I not like to hear 
him? 

That tempted me, and I jdelded again. Coming homo, 
he spoke of a time I had passed him in the street and cut 
him, shortly after my return from New Haven. Did I 
really mean — 

“ I did not see you, I am sure,” I cried quickly. “ I 
would not have been so rude. But we were all wild about 
my brother Archie just then.” 

“ Well, I’m glad it wasn’t meant. I don’t see why ” —
