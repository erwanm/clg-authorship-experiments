young sailor is almost as much afraid of taking in sail too soon as of
being too tardy in doing so. There is as much vanity in carrying sail as
in wearing fine clothes. The captain did not wish to be too cautious,
for that would cause a smile upon the faces of the ship's crew.

He looked at Mr. Lowington, who seemed to be perfectly satisfied, or
rather his attention was directed entirely to the Josephine, which had
not yet taken in her huge fore square-sail. Then he studied the
threatening pile of black clouds, which had now nearly reached the
zenith; while the thunder rattled, and the lightnings flashed with
blinding glare.

"Take in topgallant-sails and royals," said Captain Haven to the officer
of the deck, now satisfied that his reputation for carrying sail could
not suffer in the face of such admonitory indications.

Mr. Ellis called on the entire starboard watch to obey his orders; for
only a quarter watch was required to handle the ship under ordinary
circumstances, the other portion of the watch being idlers on deck. The
light sails were taken in; and Mr. Lowington made no comment, as he
sometimes did, after an evolution had been performed, in order to
express his approval or otherwise of the action of the captain.

The Josephine was most strangely deficient in caution on the present
occasion, and the principal was evidently much disturbed by the conduct
of her captain, who was usually very prudent, without being timid. There
she was, with all her extra sail set and flapping in the calm, while a
tempest was brewing before her.

"Captain Kendall must be asleep," said Mr. Lowington, nervously, to
Peaks, the adult boatswain of the ship.

"And the officers too," replied the old salt, hitching up his trousers.
"We ought to fire a gun to wake them up."

"It is not like Captain Kendall to be caught napping when a squall is
gathering," added the principal.

"I should think the thunder would wake them up. It's heavy for these
parts. That squall will come all at once when it does come. It will take
their sails right out of the bolt-ropes."

Mr. Lowington walked aft again, and on the quarter-deck met Flag-officer
Gordon, who had also been observing the Josephine, and wondering at her
continued neglect of the most ordinary precautions.

"Mr. Lavender," said the commander of the squadron.

The midshipman, ever ready to do the meagre duties assigned to him,
touched his cap to Captain Gordon.

"Pass the word for the signal-officer," added the flag-officer.

"That's right, Captain Gordon!" exclaimed the principal. "If the
officers of the Josephine don't do better than this, they must be
broken. I am astonished."

"So am I, sir. Captain Kendall is usually very careful, and what he
don't see isn't worth seeing."

"Be as expeditious as possible, for the squall will soon be upon us."

The signal-officer appeared with the midshipman and quartermaster in
charge of the signals. Captain Gordon ordered the number, "Take in
sail," to be set.

Paul Kendall was severely criticised on board of the ship; but, before
he has suffered too much in the estimation of his sympathizing friends,
let our readers be transferred to the steerage of the Josephine, in
which, as the consort of the Academy Ship, the same rules and
regulations prevailed. The port watch were at their studies, while the
starboard watch had the deck, in charge of Mr. Terrill, the first
lieutenant. This was the captain's study time, for he was a member of
the several classes, and in school hours was subject to the discipline
of the professors, the same as other students.

When the squall began to gather, Professor Hamblin was hearing the
recitation in Greek. The learned gentleman did not think a scholar knew
anything unless he possessed a considerable knowledge of Greek. It was
his favorite branch, and the class in this language was his pet. He was
a strict disciplinarian, and never allowed anything to interrupt the
recitation in Greek if he could possibly avoid it. No scholar, not even
the captain, as the regulations then were, could leave the class without
his permission. It is true, the rule had not been made, or even been
considered, with special reference to the commander of the vessel; but
Paul had always quietly submitted to it, even at some inconvenience and
sacrifice to himself. No emergency had arisen, since the Josephine went
into commission, which required the setting aside of the rule, and it
was supposed the professors would have judgment enough to use it with
proper discretion.

Professor Hamblin, so far as Greek roots were concerned, was not lacking
in judgment; but he knew no more about a ship than Cleats, the
boatswain, did about Greek. He was a very learned man, and lived in a
Greek and Latin atmosphere. The dead languages were the chief end of man
to him. He was cold, stern, and precise, except that, when hearing a
class in Greek, he warmed up a little, and became more human, especially
if the students manifested a becoming interest in his favorite branch.

Unfortunately for Paul Kendall, he was not an enthusiastic devotee of
the Greek language and literature. He lived too much in the present to
be enamoured of anything so old, and, as it seemed to him, so
comparatively useless. But he was faithful in the discharge of all the
academic requirements of the institution, not excepting even those
branches which he disliked. Though he was always very respectful to
Professor Hamblin, he was candid enough to say that he did not like
Greek. He was, therefore, no favorite of the learned gentleman, who
thought his abilities and his scholarship were over-estimated--because
he did not like the dead languages.

"Mr. Terrill directs me to inform you that a squall is coming up," said
Ritchie, the third master, as he touched his cap to Captain Kendall.

"No interruption! No interruption!" interposed Professor Hamblin, very
ill-naturedly.

The third master touched his cap, as the captain bowed to him in
acknowledgment that he had heard the message, and then retired. The
professor was vexed: perhaps he was a little more ill-natured than
usual, on account of being slightly seasick--an effect produced by the
uneasy roll of the vessel in the calm.

"Now, Mr. Kendall, go on with the dual of [Greek: admÃªv]," added he, as
Ritchie retired.

"I must beg you will excuse me, Professor Hamblin," said Paul, with the
utmost deference, as he rose from the bench on which he was seated.

"Go on with the dual!" replied the professor, sternly.

Paul looked at the snapping gray eye of the learned gentleman, and was
assured that he had a will of his own. As the captain of the Josephine,
he did not wish to set an example of insubordination, which others might
adopt before they were certain that the emergency required it. He had
not seen the gathering clouds, and he had full confidence in the
judgment and skill of Terrill, who was in charge of the deck. The rule
was that the professors should be obeyed in study hours. This had always
been the regulation on board the ship; but, then, the principal, who was
a sailor himself, was always present to prevent any abuse of power.

Paul decided to yield the point for a time, at least, and he recited his
lesson as directed by the professor. Half an hour later, Ritchie
appeared again, with another message from the first lieutenant, to the
effect that the squall was almost upon them. This was about the time
that Flag-officer Gordon had sent for the signal-officer, on board of
the ship.

"You must excuse me now, Professor Hamblin, for I must go on deck," said
Paul, as respectfully as he could speak.

"I can't spare you; I haven't finished the exercise yet," replied Mr.
Hamblin, sourly. "This is a plan to break up the lesson in Greek,
because some of the young gentlemen don't like to study it."

"I beg your pardon, sir; but the officer of the deck sends me word that
the squall is upon us. You can hear the thunder and see the lightning,"
added Paul.

"I am not afraid of thunder and lightning," growled the professor. "My
classes are not to be broken up on any frivolous pretences. Mr.
Lowington assured me I had full powers over all during study hours; and
I tell you to be seated, and go on with your recitation."

"But the vessel is in danger, sir," protested Paul.

"I'm not afraid, and you need not be. Take your seat, sir, or I will
report you to the principal."

Paul's face flushed. No officer or professor had before ever threatened
to report him to Mr. Lowington. Mr. Hamblin was as ignorant as a baby
upon nautical matters, and while the Josephine rolled easily on the
waves, and the sails flapped idly against the masts, he could imagine no
peril.

"I am sorry to disobey your order, sir; but in this instance I must,"
said Paul, firmly, though his voice trembled with emotion.

"Very well, sir," replied the professor, angrily, "I shall report you to
the principal, and if I have any influence with him, you will be removed
from your present position."
