POSSAGNO, CANOVA'S BIRTHPLACE. 

IT did not take a long time to exhaust the interest 
of Bassano, but we were sorry to leave the place 
because of the excellence of the inn at which we 
tarried. It was called "II Mondo," and it had 
every thing in it that heart could wish. Our rooms 
were miracles of neatness and comfort ; they had the 
freshness, not the rawness, of recent repair, and they 
opened into the dining-hall, where we were served 
with indescribable salads and risotti. During our 
sojourn we simply enjoyed the house ; when we were 
come away we wondered that so much perfection of 
hotel could exist in so small a town as Bassano. It 
is one of the pleasures of by-way travel in Italy, that 
you are everywhere introduced in character, that 
you become fictitious and play a part as in a novel. 
To this inn of The World, our driver had brought us 
with a clamor and rattle proportioned to the fee re- 
ceived from us, and when, in response to his haughty 
summons, the cameriere, who had been gossiping 
with the cook, threw open the kitchen door, and 
stood out to welcome us in a broad square of forth- 
streaming rud(Jy light, amid the lovely odors of broil- 
ing and roasting, our driver saluted him with, " Re- 



 

ceive these gentle folks, and treat them to your very 
best. They are worthy of any thing." This at once 
put us back several centuries, and we never ceased 
to be lords and ladies of the period of Don Quixote 
as long as we rested in that inn. 

It was a bright and breezy Sunday when we left 
" II Mondo," and gayly journeyed toward Treviso, 
intending to visit Possagno, the birthplace of Canova, 
on our way. The road to the latter place passes 
through a beautiful country, that gently undulates 
on either hand till in the distance it rises into pleasant 
hills and green mountain heights. Possagno itself 
lies upon the brink of a declivity, down the side of 
which drops terrace after terrace, all planted with 
vines and figs and peaches, to a watercourse below. 
The ground on which the village is built, with its 
quaint and antiquated stone cottages, slopes gently 
northward, and on a little rise upon the left hand 
of us coming from Bassano, we saw that stately edi- 
fice with which Canova has honored his humble 
birthplace. It is a copy of the Pantheon, and it 
cannot help being beautiful and imposing, but it 
would be utterly out of place in any other than an 
Italian village. Here, however, it consorted well 
enough with the lingering qualities of the old pagan 
civilization still perceptible in Italy. A sense of 
that past was so strong with us as we ascended 
the broad stairway leading up the slope from the 
village to the level on which the temple stands at 
the foot of a mountain, that we might well have 
believed we approached an altar devoted to the elder 



 

worship : through the open doorway and between 
the columns of the portico we could see the priests 
moving to and fro, and the voice of their chant- 
ing came out to us like the sound of hymns to some 
of the deities long disowned; and I remembered 

how Padre L had said to me in Venice, " Our 

blessed saints are only the old gods baptized and 
christened anew." Within as without, the temple 
resembled the Pantheon, but it had little to show us. 
The niches designed by Canova for statues of the 
saints are empty yet ; but there are busts by his own 
hand of himself and his brother, the Bishop Canova. 
Among the people was the sculptor's niece, whom 
our guide pointed out to us, and who was evidently 
used to being looked at. She seemed not to dislike 
it, and stared back at us amiably enough, being 
a good-natured, plump, comely dark-faced lady of 
perhaps fifty years. 

Possagno is nothing if not Canova, and our guide, 
a boy, knew all about him, how, more especially, 
he had first manifested his wonderful genius by 
modeling a group of sheep out of the dust of the 
highway, and how an Inglese happening along in his 
carriage, saw the boy's work and gave him a plate- 
ful of gold napoleons. I dare say this is as near the 
truth as most facts. And is it not better for the his- 
toric Canova to have begun in this way than to have 
poorly picked up the rudiments of his art in the 
workshop of his father, a maker of altar-pieces and 
the like for country churches ? The Canova family 
has intermarried with the Venetian nobility, and will 





not credit those stories of Canova's beginnings which 
his townsmen so fondly cherish. I believe they would 
even distrust the butter-lion with which the boy- 
sculptor is said to have adorned the table of the noble 
Falier, and first won his notice. 

Besides the temple at Possagno, there is a very 
pretty gallery containing casts of all Canova's works. 
It is an interesting place, where Psyches and Cupids 
flutter, where Venuses present themselves in every 
variety of attitude, where Sorrows sit upon hard, 
straight-backed classic chairs, and mourn in the 
society of faithful Storks ; where the Bereft of this 
century surround death-beds in Greek costume appro- 
priate to the scene ; where Muses and Graces sweetly 
pose themselves and insipidly srnile, and where the 
Dancers and Passions, though nakeder, are no wick- 
eder than the Saints and Virtues. In all, there are 
a hundred and ninety-five pieces in the gallery, and 
among the rest the statue named George Washing- 
ton, which was sent to America in 1820, and after- 
wards destroyed by fire in the Capitol. The figure 
is in a sitting posture ; naturally, it is in the dress of 
a Roman general ; and if it does not look much like 
George Washington, it does resemble Julius Caesar. 

The custodian of the gallery had been Canova's 
body-servant, and he loved to talk of his master. 
He had so far imbibed the family spirit that he did 
not like to allow that Canova had ever been other 
than rich and grand, and he begged us not to believe 
the idle stories of his first essays in art. He was 
delighted with our interest in the imperial Washing- 



 

ton, and our pleasure in the whole gallery, which we 
viewed with the homage due to the man who had 
rescued the world from Swaggering in sculpture. 
When we were satisfied, he invited us, with his 
mistress's permission, into the house of the Canovas 
adjoining the gallery ; and there we saw many paint- 
ings by the sculptor, pausing longest in a lovely 
little room decorated after the Pompeian manner with 
scherzi in miniature panels representing the jocose 
classic usualities : Cupids escaping from cages, and 
being sold from them, and playing many pranks and 
games with Nymphs and Graces. 

Then Canova was done, and Possagno was fin- 
ished ; and we resumed our way to Treviso, a town 
nearly as much porticoed as Padua, and having a 
memory and hardly any other consciousness. The 
Duomo, which is perhaps the ugliest duomo in the 
world, contains an " Annunciation," by Titian, one 
of his best paintings ; and in the Monte di Pietd is 
the grand and beautiful " Entombment," by which 
Giorgione is perhaps most worthily remembered. 
The church of San Nicolo is interesting from its 
quaint and pleasing frescos by the school of Giotto. 
At the railway station an admirable old man sells the 
most delicious white and purple grapes. 



VI. 
COMO. 

MY visit to Lake Como has become to me a dream 
of summer, a vision that remains faded the whole 
year round, till the blazing heats of July bring out 
the sympathetic tints in which it was vividly painted.
