accent. Perhaps, even, you have married a lord ; I almost hope 
you have, for I want some introductions to the first people, and 
shall count on you for a few. The Interviewer wants some light 
on the nobility. My first impressions (of the people at large) 
are not rose-coloured ; but I wish to talk them over with you, 
and you know that whatever I am, at least I am not superficial. 
I have also something very particular to tell you. Do appoint a 
meeting as quickly as you can ; come to London (I should like 
so much to visit the sights with you), or else let me come to you, 
wherever you are. I will do so with pleasure ; for you know 
everything interests me, and I wish to see as much as possible of 
the inner life." 

Isabel did not show this letter to her uncle ; but she acquainted 
him with its purport, and, as she expected, he begged her 
instantly to assure Miss Stackpole, in his name, that he should 



 

be delighted to receive her at Gardencourt. " Though she is a 
literary lady," he said, " I suppose that, being an American, she 
won't reproduce me, as that other one did. She has seen others 
like me." 

" She has seen no other so delightful ! " Isabel answered ; but 
she was not altogether at ease about Henrietta's reproductive 
instincts, which belonged to that side of her friend's character 
which she regarded with least complacency. She wrote to Miss 
Stackpole, however, that she would be very welcome under Mr. 
Touchett's roof; and this enterprising young woman lost no time 
in signifying her intention of arriving. She had gone up to 
London, and it was from the metropolis that she took the train 
for the station nearest to Gardencourt, where Isabel and Ralph 
were in waiting to receive the visitor. 

"Shall I love her, or shall I hate her?" asked Ealph, while 
they stood on the platform, before the advent of the train. 

"Whichever you do will matter very little to her," said 
Isabel. " She doesn't care a straw what men think of her." 

"As a man I am bound to dislike her, then. She must be a 
kind of monster. Is she very ugly 1 " 

" No, she is decidedly pretty." 

" A female interviewer, a reporter in petticoats 1 I am very 
curious to see her," Ealph declared. 

"It is very easy to laugh at her, but it is not easy to be as 
brave as she." 

" I should think not ; interviewing requires bravery.  )o you 
suppose she will interview me?" 

"Never in the world. She will not think you of enough 
importance." 

" You will see," said Ralph. " She will send a description of 
us all, including Bunchie, to her newspaper." 

" I shall ask her not to," Isabel answered. 

" You think she is capable of it, then." 

" Perfectly." 

"And yet you have made her your bosom-friend?" 

" I have not made her my bosom-friend ; but I like her, in 
spite of her faults." 

"Ah, well," said Ralph, "I am afraid I shall dislike her, in 
spite of her merits." 

" You will probably fall in love with her at the end of three 
days." 

"And have my love-letters published in the Interviewer 9 
Never ! " cried the young man. 

The train presently arrived, and Miss Stackpole, promptly 



 

descending, proved to be, as Isabel had said, decidedly pretty. 
She was a fair, plump person, of medium stature, with a round 
face, a small mouth, a delicate complexion, a bunch of light 
brown ringlets at the back of her head, and a peculiarly open, 
surprised-looking eye. The most striking point in her appear- 
ance was the remarkable fixedness of this organ, which rested 
without impudence or defiance, but as if in conscientious exercise 
of a natural right, upon every object it happened to encounter. 
It rested in this manner upon Ralph himself, who was somewhat 
disconcerted by Miss Stackpole's gracious and comfortable aspect, 
which seemed to indicate that it would not be so easy as he had 
assumed to disapprove of her. She was very well dressed, in 
fresh, dove-coloured draperies, and Ralph saw at a glance that 
she was scrupulously, fastidiously neat. From top to toe she 
carried not an ink-stain. She spoke in a clear, high voice a 
voice not rich, but loud, though after she had taken her place, 
with her companions, in Mr. Touchett's carriage, she struck him, 
rather to his surprise, as not an abundant talker. She answered 
the inquiries made of her by Isabel, however, and in which the 
young man ventured to join, with a great deal of precision and 
distinctness ; and later, in the library at Gardencourt, when she 
had made the acquaintance of Mr. Touchett (his wife not having 
thought it necessary to appear), did more to give the measure of 
her conversational powers. 

" Well, I should like to know whether you consider yourselves 
American or English," she said. " If once I knew, I could talk 
to you accordingly." 

"Talk to us anyhow, and we shall be thankful," Ralph 
answered, liberally. 

She fixed her eyes upon him, and there was something in 
their character that reminded him of large, polished buttons ; he 
seemed to see the reflection of surrounding objects upon the 
pupil. The expression of a button is not usually deemed human, 
but there was something in Miss Stackpole's gaze that made him, 
as he was a very modest man, feel vaguely embarrassed and 
uncomfortable. This sensation, it must be added, after he had 
spent a day or two in her company, sensibly diminished, though 
it never wholly disappeared. ' I don't suppose that you are 
going to undertake to persuade me that you are an American," 
she said. 

"To please you, I will be an Englishman, I will be a 
Turk ! " 

"Well, if you can change about that way, you are very 
welcome," Miss Stackpole rejoined. 



 

" I am sure you understand everything, and that differences 
of nationality are no barrier to you," Ralph went on. 

Miss Stackpole gazed at him still. " Do you mean the foreign 
languages 1 " 

" The languages are nothing. I mean the spirit the 
genius." 

" I am not sure that I understand you," said the correspondent 
of the Interviewer; " but I expect I shall before I leave." 

" He is what is called a cosmopolitan," Isabel suggested. 

" That means he's a little of everything and not much of any. 
I must say I think patriotism is like charity it begins at 
home." 

" Ah, but where does home begin, Miss Stackpole 1 " Ralph 
inquired. 

" I don't know where it begins, but I know where it ends. 
It ended a long time before I got here." 

" Don't you like it over here 1 " asked Mr. Touchett, with his 
mild, wise, aged, innocent voice. 

" Well, sir, I haven't quite made up my mind what ground E 
shall take. I feel a good deal cramped. I felt it on the journey 
from Liverpool to London." 

" Perhaps you were in a crowded carriage," Ralph suggested. 

" Yes, but it was crowded with friends a party of Americans 
whose acquaintance I had made upon the steamer ; a most lovely 
group, from Little Rock, Arkansas. In spite of that I felt 
cramped I felt something pressing upon me; I couldn't tell
