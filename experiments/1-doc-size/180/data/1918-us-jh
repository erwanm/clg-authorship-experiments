 

some power cruel and implacable, which plots against domestic 
tranquillity; perhaps it was some hireling of capitalism, which 
will not permit a propagandist of social justice to do his work 
in peace of soul ! 

Jimmie tried to hide what was going on; and of course 
poor, naive soul he had never learned to hide anything in his 
life, and now was too late to begin. The next time the local 
met, the women were saying that they were disappointed in 
Comrade Higgins; they had thought he was really devoted to 
the cause, but they saw now he was like all the rest of the men 
his head had been turned by one smile on a pretty face. Instead 
of attending to his work, he was following that Baskerville 
creature about, gazing at her yearningly, like a moon-calf, mak- 
ing a ninny of himself before the whole room. And he with a 
wife and three babies at home, waiting for him and thinking he 
was hustling for the cause. When the meeting adjourned, and 
the Baskerville creature accepted the invitation of Comrade 
Gerrity to escort her home, the dismay of Comrade Higgins 
was so evident as to be ludicrous to the whole room. 



In the interest of common decency it was necessary for the 
women of the local to take action on this matter. At least, a 
couple of them thought so, and quite independently and without 
prearrangement they called on Lizzie next day and told her that 
she should come more frequently to meetings, and keep herself 
acquainted with the new ideas of advanced feminism. And so 
when Jimmie came home that night, he found his wife dissolved 
in tears, and there was a most harrowing scene. 

For poor Elizabeth Huszar, pronounced Eleeza Betooser, had 
had no chance whatever to familiarise herself with the new ideas 
of advanced feminism. Her notions of "free unions" had been 
derived from a quite different world, whose ideas were not new, 
but on the contrary very, very old, and were "advanced" only 
on the road to perdition. She judged Jimmie's behaviour ac- 
cording to thoroughly old standards, and she was broken-hearted, 
overwhelmed with grief and shame. He was like all the rest 
of men and when she had fondly thought he was different! 
He despised her and spit upon her a woman he had picked up in 
a brothel. 





Poor Jimmie was stunned. He was conscious of no disre- 
spect for Lizzie, it had not occurred to him to think that she 
might take the matter that way. But so she had taken it, 
beyond doubt, and with intensity that frightened him. He 
would not have believed that so many tears could stream from 
one woman's eyes nor that his good, broad-faced, honest wife 
could be so abject in her misery. "Oh, I knowed it, I knowed 
it all along it would be that way! I hadn't never ought to 
married you you know I told you so !" 

"But, Lizzie!" pleaded the husband. "You're mistaken. 
That hadn't nothin' to do with it." 

She turned upon him wildly, her fingers stuck out as if she 
would claw him. "You mean to tell me if you hadn't 'a married 
a woman off the street, you'd 'a gone chasin' a fluffy-haired girl ? 
If you'd 'a, had a decent wife, that you knowed had some 
rights " 

"Lizzie !" he protested, in consternation. "'Listen here " 

But she was not to be stopped. "Everybody said I was a 
fool; but I went an' done it, 'cause you swore you'd never hold 
it up to me ! An' I went an' had them children" Lizzie swept 
her arm at the children, as if to wipe them off the earth, to which 
they had come by a cruel mistake. Jimmie Junior, who was 
old enough to know that something serious was happening, and 
whose instinct was all against being wiped off the earth, began 
to howl wildly; and that set off the little ones soon they were 
all three of them going at the top of their lungs. "Boo-hoo- 
hoo !" 

It was truly a terrible climax to a romance. Jimmie, 
almost distracted, seized the hand of his injured spouse. "It'b 
all nonsense!" he cried. "What they been tellin' you? I ain't 
done a thing, Lizzie ! I only walked home with her one night.' 

But Lizzie answered that one night was plenty enough v 
she knew that from intimate and hateful experience. "And I 
know them fluffy-headed kind that frizzes their hair. What doea 
she want to walk home at night with married men fer? And 
talkin' about the things she does " 

"She don't mean no harm, Lizzie she's tryin' to help 
workin' women. It's what's called birth control she wants 
to teach women " 

"If she wants to teach women, why don't she talk to the 
women? What's she all the time talkin' to men fer? You 



 

think you can tell me tales like that me, that's been what I 
have?" And Lizzie went off into another fit, worse than ever. 



VI 

Jimmie found that it was with romance as with martyrdom 
there was a lot of trouble about it which the romancers did 
not mention. He really felt quite dreadful, for he had a deep 
regard for this mother of his little ones, and he would not 
have made her suffer for anything. And she was right, too, 
he had to admit her shots went deep home. "How'd you feel, 
if you was to find out I'd been walkin' home with some man ?" 
When it was put to him that way, he realised that he would 
have felt very badly indeed. 

A flood of old emotions came back to him. He went in 
memory with his group of roystering friends to the house of 
evil where he had first met Elizabeth Huszar, pronounced 
Eleeza Betooser. She had taken him to her room, and instead 
of making herself agreeable in the usual way, had burst into 
tears. She had been ill-treated, and was wretchedly lonely 
and unhappy. Jimmie asked why she did not quit the life, 
and she answered that she had tried more than once, but she 
could not earn a living wage; and anyhow, because she was 
big and handsome, the bosses would never let her alone, and 
what was the difference, if you couldn't keep away from the 
men? 

They sat on the bed and talked, and Jimmie told her a 
little about his life, and she tolcf about hers a pitiful and 
moving story. She had been brought to America as an infant; 
her father had been killed in an accident, and her mother 
had supported several children by scrub-work. Lizzie had 
grown up in a slum of the far east side of New York, and she 
could not remember a time when she had not been sexually 
preyed upon; lewd little boys had taught her tricks, and men 
would buy her with candy or food. And yet there had been 
something in her struggling for decency; of her own volition 
she had tried to go to school, in spite of her rags; and then, 
when she was thirteen, she had answered an advertisement for 
work as a nurse-maid. That story had made an especial im- 
pression upon Jimmie it was truly a most pitiful episode. 

Her place of employment had been a "swell" apartment, 





with a hall-boy and an elevator the most wonderful place 
that Lizzie had ever beheld; it was like living in heaven, and 
she had tried so hard to do what she was told, and be worthy 
of her beautiful mistress and the lovely baby. But she had 
been there only two days when the mistress had discovered 
vermin on the baby, and had come to Lizzie and insisted 
on examining her head. And of course she had found some- 
thing. "Them's only nits " Lizzie had said ; she had never 
heard of anybody who did not have "nits" in their hair. But 
the beautiful lady had called her a vile creature, and ordered 
her to pack up her things and get out of the house at once. 
And so Lizzie had had to wait until she became an inmate of a 
brothel before anybody took the trouble to teach her how to get 
the "nits" out of her hair, and how to bathe, and to clean her 
finger-nails and otherwise be physically decent. 

Jimmie recalled all that, and he fell on his knees before 
his wife, and caught her two hands by main force, and swore 
to her that he had not done any wrong; he went on to tell 
her exactly what wrong he had done, which was the best way to 
convince her that he had not done any worse. He vowed again 
and again that he would never, never dally with Cupid again 
he would see Comrade Baskerville at once and tell her it was 
"all off."
