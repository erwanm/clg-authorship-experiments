the farm. He was sent with half a dozen others to 
pick up stones in a neighboring field. No officer was 
with them, and Bobby was struck with the apparent 
freedom of the institution, and he so expressed him- 
self to his companions. 



" Not so much freedom as you think for," said one, 
in reply. 

"I should think the fellows would clear out." 

" Not so easy a matter. There is a standing re- 
ward of five dollars to any one who brings back a 
runaway." 

" They must catch him first." 

" No fellow ever got away yet. They always 
caught him before he got ten miles from the place." 

This was an important suggestion to Bobby, who 
already had a definite purpose in his mind. Like a 
skilful general, he had surveyed the ground on his 
arrival, and was at once prepared to execute his de- 
sign. 

In his conversation with the boys, he obtained the 
history of several who had attempted to escape, and 
found that even those who got a fair start were taken 
on some public road. He perceived that they were 
not good generals, and he determined to profit by 
their mistake. 

A short distance from the institution was what ap- 
peared to be a very extensive wood. Beyond this, 
many miles distant, he could see the ocean glittering 
like a sheet of ice under the setting sun. 



He carefully observed the hills, and obtained the 
bearings of various prominent objects in the vicinity, 
which would aid him in his flight. The boys gave 
him all the information in their power about the 
localities of the country. They seemed to feel that 
he was possessed of a superior spirit, and that he 
would not long remain among them ; but, whatever 
they thought, they kept their own counsel. 

Bobby behaved well, and was so intelligent and 
prompt that he obtained the confidence of the super- 
intendent, who began to employ him about the house, 
and in his own family. He was sent of errands in 
the neighborhood, and conducted himself so much to 
the satisfaction of his guardians that he was not re- 
quired to work in the field after the second day of his 
residence on the farm. 



One afternoon he was told that his clothes were 
ready, and that he might put them on the next morn- 
ing. This was a disagreeable announcement ; for 
Bobby saw that, with the uniform of the institution 
upon his back, his chance of escape would be very 
slight. But about sunset, he was sent by the super- 
intendent's lady to deliver a note at a house in the 
vicinity. 



 

"Now or never ! " said Bobby to himself, after he 
had left the house. " Now's my time." 

As he passed the gate, he secured his money, and 
placed it in the secret receptacle of his jacket. After 
he had delivered the letter, he took the road and 
hastened off in the direction of the wood. His heart 
beat wildly at the prospect of once more meeting his 
mother, after nearly four weeks' absence. Annie Lee 
would welcome him ; she would not believe that he 
was a thief. 

He had been four days an inmate of the Reform 
School, and nothing but the hope of soon attaining 
his liberty had kept his spirits from drooping. He 
had not for a moment despaired of getting away. 

He reached the entrance to the wood, and taking a 
cart path, began to penetrate its hidden depths. The 
night darkened upon him ; he heard the owl screech 
his dismal note, and the whip-poor-will chant his 
cheery song. A certain sense of security now per- 
vaded his mind, for the darkness concealed him from 
the world, and he had placed six good miles between 
him and the prison, as he considered it. 

He walked on, however, till he came to what 

seemed to be the end of the wood, and he hoped to 
reach the blue ocean he had seen in the distance be- 
fore morning. Leaving the forest, he emerged into 
the open country. There was here and there a house 
before him ; but the aspect of the country seemed 
strangely familiar to him. He could not understand 
it. He had never been in this part of the country 
before ; yet there was a great house with two barns 
by the side of it, which he was positive he had seen 
before. 

He walked across the field a little farther, when, to 
his astonishment and dismay, he beheld the lofty tur- 
rets of the State Reform School. He had been walk- 
ing in a circle, and had come out of the forest near 
the place where he had entered it. 

Bobby, as the reader has found out by this time, 
was a philosopher as well as a hero ; and instead of 
despairing or wasting his precious time in vain re- 
grets at his mistake, he laughed a little to himself at 
the blunder, and turned back into the woods again. 

"Now or never!" muttered he. "It will never 
do to give it up so." 

For an hour he walked on, with his eyes fixed on 



 

a great bright star in the sky. Then he found that 
the cart path crooked round, and he discovered where 
he had made his blunder. Leaving the road, he 
made his way in a straight line, still guided by the 
star, till he came to a large sheet of water. 

The sheet of water was an effectual barrier to his 
farther progress ; indeed, he was so tired he did not 
feel able to walk any more. He deemed himself 
safe from immediate pursuit in this secluded place. 
He needed rest, and he foresaw that the next few 
days would be burdened with fatigue and hardship 
which he must be prepared to meet. 

Bobby was not nice about trifles, and his habits 
were such that he had no fear of taking cold. His 
comfortable bed in the little black house was prefer- 
able to the cold ground, even with the primeval forest 
for a chamber ; but circumstances alter cases, and he 
did not waste any vain regrets about the necessity of 
his position. After finding a secluded spot in the 
wood, he raked the dry leaves together for a bed, 
and offering his simple but fervent prayer to the 
Great Guardian above, he lav clown to rest. The 
owl screamed his dismal note, and the whip-poor-will 




still repeated his monotonous song ; but they were 
good company in the solitude of the dark forest. 

He could not go to sleep for a time, so strange and 
exciting were the circumstances of his position. He 
thought of a thousand things, but he could not think 
himself to sleep, as he was wont to do. At last 
nature, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, conquered 
the circumstances, and he slept.
