she, 'What will all the poor do when he is gone?' So your Reverence
must pardon us. We mean it all for the best."

So saying, the man turned and began sliding and slipping down the steep
ashy sides of the mountain cone with a dexterity which carried him to
the bottom in a few moments; and on he went, sending back after him a
cheerful little air, the refrain of which is still to be heard in our
days in that neighborhood. A word or two of the gay song fluttered back
on the ear of the monk,--

        "Tutta gioja, tutta festa."

So gay and airy it was in its ringing cadence that it seemed a musical
laugh springing from sunny skies, and came fluttering into the dismal
smoke and gloom of the mountaintop like a very butterfly of sound.
It struck on the sad, leaden ear of the monk much as we might fancy
the carol of a robin over a grave might seem, could the cold sleeper
below wake one moment to its perception. If it woke one regretful sigh
and drew one wandering look downward to the elysian paradise that
lay smiling at the foot of the mountain, he instantly suppressed the
feeling and set his face in its old deathly stillness.




CHAPTER XIX

CLOUDS DEEPENING


After the departure of her uncle to Florence, the life of Agnes was
troubled and harassed from a variety of causes.

First, her grandmother was sulky and moody, and though saying nothing
directly on the topic nearest her heart, yet intimating by every
look and action that she considered Agnes as a most ungrateful and
contumacious child. Then there was a constant internal perplexity,--a
constant wearying course of self-interrogation and self-distrust, the
pain of a sensitive spirit which doubts at every moment whether it may
not be falling into sin. The absence of her kind uncle at this time
took from her the strongest support on which she had leaned in her
perplexities. Cheerful, airy, and elastic in his temperament, always
full of fresh-springing and beautiful thoughts, as an Italian dell is
of flowers, the charming old man seemed, while he stayed with Agnes, to
be the door of a new and fairer world, where she could walk in air and
sunshine, and find utterance for a thousand thoughts and feelings which
at all other times lay in cold repression in her heart. His counsels
were always so wholesome, his sympathies so quick, his devotion so
fervent and cheerful, that while with him Agnes felt the burden of her
life insensibly lifted and carried for her as by some angel guide.

Now they had all come back upon her, heavier a thousand-fold than
ever they had been before. Never did she so much need counsel and
guidance,--never had she so much within herself to be solved and made
plain to her own comprehension; yet she thought with a strange shiver
of her next visit to her confessor. That austere man, so chilling, so
awful, so far above all conception of human weaknesses, how should she
dare to lay before him all the secrets of her breast, especially when
she must confess to having disobeyed his most stringent commands? She
had had another interview with this forbidden son of perdition, but
how it was she knew not. How could such things have happened? Instead
of shutting her eyes and turning her head and saying prayers, she had
listened to a passionate declaration of love, and his last word had
called her his wife. Her heart thrilled every time she thought of it;
and somehow she could not feel sure that it was exactly a thrill of
penitence. It was all like a strange dream to her; and sometimes she
looked at her little brown hands and wondered if he really had kissed
them,--he, the splendid strange vision of a man, the prince from
fairy-land! Agnes had never read romances, it is true, but she had been
brought up on the legends of the saints, and there never was a marvel
possible to human conception that had not been told there. Princes
had come from China and Barbary and Abyssinia and every other strange
out-of-the-way place, to kneel at the feet of fair, obdurate saints who
would not even turn the head to look at them; but she had acted, she
was conscious, after a much more mortal fashion, and so made herself
work for confession and penance. Yet certainly she had not meant to do
so; the interview came on her so suddenly, so unexpectedly; and somehow
he would speak, and he would not go when she asked him to; and she
remembered how he looked when he stood right before her in the door-way
and told her she should hear him,--how the color flushed up in his
cheeks, what a fire there was in his great dark eyes; he looked as if
he were going to do something desperate then; it made her hold her
breath even now to think of it.

"These princes and nobles," she thought, "are so used to command, it
is no wonder they make us feel as if they must have their will. I have
heard grandmother call them wolves and vultures, that are ready to
tear us poor folk to pieces; but I am sure he seems gentle. I'm sure
it isn't wicked or cruel for him to want to make me his wife; and he
couldn't know, of course, why it wasn't right he should; and it really
is beautiful of him to love me so. Oh, if I were only a princess, and
he loved me that way, how glad I should be to give up everything and go
to him alone! And then we would pray together; and I really think that
would be much better than praying all alone. He said men had so much
more to tempt them. Ah, that is true! How can little moles that grub in
the ground know of the dangers of eagles that fly to the very sun? Holy
Mother, look mercifully upon him and save his soul!"

Such were the thoughts of Agnes the day when she was preparing for
her confession; and all the way to church she found them floating and
dissolving and reappearing in new forms in her mind, like the silvery
smoke-clouds which were constantly veering and sailing over Vesuvius.

Only one thing was firm and never changing, and that was the purpose to
reveal everything to her spiritual director. When she kneeled at the
confessional with closed eyes, and began her whispered acknowledgments,
she tried to feel as if she were speaking in the ear of God
alone,--that God whose spirit she was taught to believe, for the time
being, was present in His minister before whom her inmost heart was to
be unveiled.

He who sat within had just returned from his lonely retreat with his
mind and nerves in a state of unnatural tension,--a sort of ecstatic
clearness and calmness, which he mistook for victory and peace. During
those lonely days when he had wandered afar from human converse, and
was surrounded only by objects of desolation and gloom, he had passed
through as many phases of strange, unnatural experience as there were
flitting smoke-wreaths eddying about him.

There are depths in man's nature and his possibilities which no plummet
has ever sounded,--the wild, lonely joys of fanatical excitement, the
perfectly ravenous appetite for self-torture, which seems able, in
time, to reverse the whole human system, and make a heaven of hell.
How else can we understand the facts related both in Hindoo and in
Christian story, of those men and women who have found such strange
raptures in slow tortures, prolonged from year to year, till pain
became a habit of body and mind? It is said that after the tortures of
the rack, the reaction of the overstrained nerves produces a sense of
the most exquisite relief and repose; and so when mind and body are
harrowed, harassed to the very outer verge of endurance, come wild
throbbings and transports, and strange celestial clairvoyance, which
the mystic hails as the descent of the New Jerusalem into his soul.

It had seemed to Father Francesco, when he came down from the mountain,
that he had left his body behind him,--that he had left earth and
earthly things; his very feet touching the ground seemed to tread not
on rough, resisting soil, but on an elastic cloud. He saw a strange
excess of beauty in every flower, in every leaf, in the wavering blue
of the sea, in the red grottoed rocks that overhung the shore, with
their purple, green, orange, and yellow hangings of flower-and-leaf
tapestry. The songs of the fishermen on the beach, the peasant-girls
cutting flowery fodder for the cattle, all seemed to him to have an
unnatural charm. As one looking through a prism sees a fine bordering
of rainbow on every object, so he beheld a glorified world. His
former self seemed to him something forever past and gone. He looked
at himself as at another person, who had sinned and suffered, and
was now resting in beatified repose; and he fondly thought all this
was firm reality, and believed that he was now proof against all
earthly impressions, able to hear and to judge with the dispassionate
calmness of a disembodied spirit. He did not know that this high-strung
calmness, this fine clearness, were only the most intense forms of
nervous sensibility, and as vividly susceptible to every mortal
impression as is the vitalized chemical plate to the least action of
the sun's rays.

When Agnes began her confession, her voice seemed to him to pass
through every nerve; it seemed as if he could feel her presence
thrilling through the very wood of the confessional. He was astonished
and dismayed at his own emotion. But when she began to speak of
the interview with the cavalier, he trembled from head to foot
with uncontrollable passion. Nature long repressed came back in a
tempestuous reaction. He crossed himself again and again, he tried to
pray, and blessed those protecting shadows which concealed his emotion
from the unconscious one by his side. But he set his teeth in deadly
resolve, and his voice, as he questioned her, came forth cutting and
cold as ice crystals.

"Why did you listen to a word?"

"My father, it was so sudden. He wakened me from sleep. I answered him
before I thought."

"You should not have been sleeping. It was a sinful indolence."

"Yes, my father."

"See now to what it led. The enemy of your soul, ever watching, seized
this moment to tempt you."

"Yes, my father."
