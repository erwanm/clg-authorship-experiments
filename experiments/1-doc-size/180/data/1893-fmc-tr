“Doctor Routh came to tell me,” she answered. “He’s been there all the
morning--and as there was time before luncheon, I thought I’d come--”

“But what’s the matter with the old gentleman? This is very surprising
news--very sad news, Emma.”

A rather spasmodic, electric smile had momentarily appeared on Alexander
Lauderdale’s face, disappearing again instantly, as he uttered the last
words.

“I’m very much overcome by this news,” he added, after a short
hesitation.

He did not appear to be so deeply grieved as he said that he was, but
the words were appropriate, and Mrs. Lauderdale recognized the fact at
once.

“It will make a great difference,” she said.

“Yes, I should say so. I should say so,” repeated Alexander Junior, not
with emphasis, but slowly and thoughtfully. “However,” he continued,
suddenly, “we mustn’t count--I mean--yes--we--we mustn’t altogether
place our confidence in man--though Doctor Routh certainly stands at the
head of his profession. It’s our duty to see that other physicians are
called in consultation. We must do our utmost to help. Indeed--it might
have been wiser if you had gone there at once and had sent a messenger
for me, instead of coming here. But--yes--you haven’t told me what the
matter is, my dear. Is it--anything in the nature of apoplexy--or the
heart--you know? At his age, people rarely--but, of course, while
there’s life, there’s hope. We mustn’t forget that.”

He seemed unable to wait for his wife’s answer to his questions.

“Why, no, my dear,” she replied. “You know he’s not been very well for
some days. He’s worse--that’s all. It was nothing but a cold at first,
but it’s turned into pneumonia.”

“Pneumonia? Dear me! At his age, people rarely live through it--however,
he’s very strong, of course. Difference!” he exclaimed, softly. “Yes--a
great difference. It--it will make a great gap in the family, Emma.
We’re all so fond of him, and I’m deeply attached to him, for my part.
As for my poor father, he will be quite overcome. I hope he has not been
told yet.”

“No--I thought I’d wait and see you first.”

“Quite right, my dear--quite right--very wise. In the meantime, I think
we should be going. Yes--it’s just as well that you didn’t take off your
hat.”

He rose as he spoke, and touched one of the row of electric buttons on
his desk. A man in the livery of the Company appeared at the door, just
as Alexander was taking up his overcoat.

“I’m going up town a little earlier than usual, Donald,” he said.
“Inform Mr. Arbuckle. If anything unusual should occur, send to Mr.
Harrison Beman.”

“Yes, sir.”

“That’s all, Donald.”

The man faced about and left the office, having stood still for several
seconds, staring at Alexander. Donald had been twenty years in the
Company’s service, and did not remember that Mr. Lauderdale had ever
left the office before hours in all the ten years since he had been
chief, nor in the preceding ten during which he had occupied more or
less subordinate positions.

Mrs. Lauderdale daintily pulled down her veil and pulled up her gloves,
shook out her frock a little and looked at the points of her shoes, then
straightened her tall figure and stood ready. Alexander had slipped on
his coat, and was smoothing his hat with a silk handkerchief which he
always carried about him for that purpose. He had discovered that it
made the hat last longer. Both he and his wife had unconsciously assumed
that indescribable air which people put on when they are about to go to
church.

“We’ll take the Third Avenue Elevated,” said Mr. Lauderdale. “It’s
shorter for us.”

Robert Lauderdale’s house was close to the Park. The pair went out
together into Broad Street, and the people stared at them as they
threaded their way through the crowd. They were a handsome and striking
couple, well contrasted, the dark man, just turning grey, and the fair
woman, still as fair as ever. It might even be said that there was
something imposing in their appearance. They had that look of
unaffectedly conscious superiority which those who most dislike it most
strenuously endeavour to imitate. Moreover, when a lady, of even
passably good looks, appears down town between eleven and twelve o’clock
in the morning, she is certain to be stared at. Very soon, however, the
Lauderdales had left the busiest part of the multitude behind them. They
walked quickly, with a preoccupied manner, exchanging a few words from
time to time. Lauderdale was gradually recovering from his first
surprise.

“Did Routh say that there was no hope?” he asked, as they paused at a
crossing.

“No,” answered Mrs. Lauderdale. “He didn’t say that. He said that uncle
Robert’s condition caused him grave anxiety. Those were his very words.
You know how he speaks when a thing is serious. He said he thought that
we all ought to know it.”

“Of course--of course. Very proper. We should be the first, I’m sure.”

It would not be fair, perhaps, to say that Alexander’s voice expressed
disappointment. But he spoke very coldly and his lips closed
mechanically, like a trap, after his words. They went on a little
further. Then Mrs. Lauderdale spoke, with some hesitation.

“Alexander--I suppose you don’t know exactly--do you?” She turned and
looked at his face as she walked.

“About what?” he asked, glancing at her and then looking on before him
again.

“Well--you know--about the will--”

“My dear, what a very foolish question!” answered Alexander, with some
emphasis. “We have often talked about it. How in the world should I know
any better than any one else? Uncle Robert is a secretive man. He never
told me anything.”

“Because there are the Ralstons, you know,” pursued Mrs. Lauderdale.
“After all, they’re just as near as you are, in the way of
relationship.”

“My father is the elder--older than uncle Robert,” said Alexander.
“Katharine Ralston’s father was the youngest of the three.”

“Does that make a difference?” asked Mrs. Lauderdale.

“It ought to!” Alexander answered, energetically.




CHAPTER II.


“I’m not dying, I tell you! Don’t bother me, Routh!”

Robert Lauderdale turned impatiently on his side as he spoke, and
pointed to a chair with one of his big, old hands. Doctor Routh, an
immensely tall, elderly man, with a long grey beard and violet blue
eyes, laughed a little under his breath, and sat down.

“I’m not at all sure that you are going to die,” he said, pleasantly.

“That’s a comfort, at all events,” answered the sick man, in a husky
voice, but quite distinctly. “What the deuce made you say I was going to
die, if I wasn’t?”

“Some people are stronger than others,” answered the doctor.

“I used to be, when I was a boy.”

“It won’t do you any good to talk. If you can’t keep quiet, I shall have
to go away.”

“All right. I say--mayn’t I smoke?”

“No. Positively not.”

Doctor Routh smiled again; for he considered it a hopeful sign that the
old man should have a distinct taste for anything, considering how ill
he had been. A long silence followed, during which the two looked at one
another occasionally. Lauderdale was twenty years older than the doctor,
who was the friend, as well as the physician, of all the Lauderdale
tribe--with one or two exceptions.

The room was larger and higher than most bedrooms in New York, but it
was simply furnished, and there was very little which could be properly
considered as ornamental. Everything which was of wood was of white
pear, and the curtains were of plain white velvet, without trimmings.
Such metal work as was visible was of steel. There was a large white
Persian carpet in the middle of the room, and two or three skins of
Persian sheep served for rugs. Robert Lauderdale loved light and
whiteness, a strange fancy for so old a man; but the room was in harmony
