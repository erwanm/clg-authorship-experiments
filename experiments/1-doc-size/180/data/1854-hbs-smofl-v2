Horn. The Silver Horn is a peak, dazzlingly bright, of snow ; 
and its crest is now seen in relief against a sky of the deepest 
blue. See, also, how those dark pines of the foreground contrast with it, like the stern, mournful realities of life seen 
against the dazzling hopes of heaven. 

There is something celestial in these mountains. You 
might think such a vision as that to be a bright footstool 
of Heaven, from which the next step would be into an unknown world. The pines here begin to show that long 
white beard of moss which I admire so much in Maine. 
Now, we go right up over their heads. There, the tall 
pines are under our feet. A little more — and now above us 
rise the stern, naked rocks, where only the chamois and the 
wild goat live. But still, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, 
looks forth the Jungfrau. 

We turn to look down. That Staubbach, which in the 
valley seemed to fall from an immense precipice, "higher 
than we could gaze, is now a silver thread, far below our 
feet ; and the valley of Lauterbrunn seems as nothing. Only 
bleak, purplish crags, rising all around us, and silent, silver 
mountains looking over them. 

" That one directly before you is the Monk," says C, 
calling to me from behind, and pointing to a great snow 
peak. 

Our guide, with animation, introduced us by name to 
every one of these snow-white genii — the Falhorn, the 
Schreckhorn, the Wetterhorn, the great Eiger, and I cannot 
remember what besides. The guides seem to consider them 
all as old friends. 

Certainly nothing could be so singular, so peculiar as this 



 



ascension. We have now passed the limit of all but grass 
and Alpine flowers, which still, with their infinite variety, embroider the way ; and now the auberge is gained. Good night, 
now, and farewell. 

That is to say, there we stopped — on the summit, in fair 
view of the Jungfrau, a wall of rock crowned with fields of 
eternal snow, whose dazzling brightness almost put my eyes 
out. My head ached, too, with the thin air of these mountains. I thought I should like to stay one night just to hear 
avalanches fall ; but I cannot breathe well here, and there is a 
secret sense of horror about these sterile rocks and eternal 
snows. So, after dinner, I gladly consent to go down to Grindelwald. 

Off we start — I walking — for, to tell the truth, I have no 
fondness for riding down a path as steep in some places as a 
wall ; I leave that to C, who never fears any thing. So I 
walked all the way to Grindelwald, nine miles of a very rough 
road. There was a lady with her husband walking the same 
pass, who had come on foot the whole way from Lauterbrunn, 
and did not seem in the least fatigued. My guide exhausted 
all his eloquence to persuade me that it was better to ride ; at 
last I settled him by saying, " Why, here is a lady who has 
walked the whole route." So he confined himself after that 
to helping me find flowers, and carrying the handkerchief in 
which I stowed them. Alas ! what herbarium of hapless 
flowers, laid out stark, stiff, and motionless, like beauty on its 
bier, and with horrible long names written under them, can 
ever give an idea of the infinite variety and beauty of the 
floral crown of these mountains ! 

The herbarium resembles the bright, living reality no more 
than the morgue at St. Bernard's is a specimen of mountain 
 







travellers. Yet one thing an herbarium is good for : in looking 
at it you can recall how they looked, and glowed, and waved 
in life, with all their silver-crowned mountains around them. 

After we arrived at Grindelwald, tired as I was, I made 
sketches of nine varieties, which I intend to color as soon as 
we rest long enough. So much I did for love of the dear 
little souls. 

One noticeable feature is the predominance of yellow flowers. These, of various kinds, so abound 
as to make a distinct item of coloring in a 
distant view. One of the most common 
is this — of a vivid chrome yellow, sometimes brilliantly striped with orange. 

One thing more as to botanical names. 
What does possess botanists to afflict the 
most fragile and delicate of earth's children with such mountainous and unpronounceable names ? Now there was a dear 
little flower that I first met at St. Ber" 
nard — a little purple bell, with a fringe ; 
it is more particularly beautiful from it's growing just on the 




 

verge of avalanches, coming up and blossoming through the 
snow. I send you one in this letter, which I dug out of a 
snow bank this morning. And this fair creation — this hope 
upon a death bed — this image of love unchilled and immortal — how I wanted to know it by name ! " 

To-day, at the summit house of the mountain, I opened an 
herbarium, and there were three inches of name as hopeless 
and unpronounceable as the German »f our guides, piled upon 
my little flower. I shut the herbarium. 

This morning we started early from Grindelwald — that is, 
by eight o'clock. An unclouded, clear, breezy morning, the 
air full of the sounds of cascades, and of the little bells of the 
herds. As we began to wind upward into that delectable re- 
gion which forms the first stage of ascent, I said to C, " The 
more of beautiful scenery I see, the more I. appreciate the 
wonderful poetry of the Pilgrim's Progress." The meadows 
by the River of Life, the Delectable Mountains, the land of Beu- 
lah, how often have I thought of them ! From this we went 
off upon painting, and then upon music, the freshness of the 
mountain air inspiring our way. At last, while we were riding 
in the very lap of a rolling field full of grass and flowers, the 
sharp blue and white crystals of the glacier rose at once before us. 

" O, I want to get down," said I, " and go near them." 

Down I did get, and taking what seemed to be the straight- 
est course, began running down the hill side towards them. 

" No, no ! Back, back ! " shouted the guide, in unimaginable French and German. " Ici, ici I " 

I came back ; and taking my hand, he led me along a path 
where travellers generally go. I went closer, and sat down 
on a rock under them, and looked up. The clear sun was 



 

shining through them ; clear and blue looked the rifts and 
arches, all dripping and beautiful. We went down upon them 
by steps which a man had cut in the ice. There was one rift 
of ice we looked into, which was about fifty feet high, going 
up into a sharp arch. The inside of this arch was clear blue 
ice, of the color of crystal of blue vitriol. 

Here, immediately under, I took a rude sketch just to show 
you how a glacier looks close at hand. 




C. wanted, as usual, to do all sorts of improper things. He 
wanted to stone down blocks of ice, and to go inside the cave, 







and to go down into holes, and insisted on standing particular- 
ly long on a spot which the guide told him was all undermined, 
in order that he might pelt a cliff of ice that seemed inclined 
to fall, and hear it smash. 

The poor guide was as distressed as a hen when her ducks 
take to the water ; he ran, and called, and shouted, in Ger- 
man, French, and English, and it was not till C. had contrived 
to throw the head of the little boy's hatchet down into a cre- 
vasse, that he gave up. There were two francs to pay for this 
experiment ; but never mind ! Our guide book says that a 
clergyman of Vevay, on this glacier, fell into a crevasse sev- 
eral hundred feet deep, and was killed ; so I was glad enough 
when C. came off safe.
