a crowd round. They must have missed the
trail when Donna bolted. She’ll be at the
stable by this time.--She won’t go home.
Helen won’t know.... I shouldn’t like to
be the man that had to tell Helen!... I
must get to her--I must get home as soon
as I’ve been to the Hospital. I’m afraid I
was a little short with Helen. I wish-- (Presses
both hands to his temples as if to
command himself; looks more and more
bewildered.) I must have been pretty well
stunned--seems to me there was a collision.
I ran down somebody. It was a landau--we
crashed--I saw it overturn--there
were people in it I knew--patients....
Who?... Who? (Stamps the pavement
peremptorily, and impatiently strikes his
own head.) Who was it?--Horrible! The
brain cells do not obey me--me! (Walks
about frenziedly.) ... Ach--ch! It is
worse to remember than to forget. I have
it now--the sweetest woman of them all--Helen’s
friend--the gentlest, the most obedient,
most trustful, the bravest patient I ever
had--Mrs. Fayth. I saw her face as the carriage
went over.... She stretched out her
hands, and said: “Doctor!” It was Mary
Fayth. (His face falls into his hands.
For a moment he sinks down on the wreck of
the buggy; but springs up.) Now that accounts
for it.--The crowd are all there. The
accident was so bad nobody has thought of
me. She is the victim. I have escaped.
Dead or alive, she is done for. She never
could recover from a shock like that. I
must go and find her. I must find Mrs.
Fayth. (Starts and hurriedly walks down
the street, peering everywhere.)

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

(In his absence no person passes the street.)

       Re-enter DR. THORNE.

Strange! How strange! I cannot find her. I cannot find anything--nor
anybody that a man would naturally meet under such circumstances. Not a
trace of the accident--yet I’m as sure of it as I am that I’m alive.
(Pronounces these words slowly, and paces the sidewalk, irresolute.)
It all came from my being overdue at the Hospital. I suppose I did drive
Donna pretty fast. I wonder if I struck her? I am always in such an
infernal hurry--I never have had time to live. I am driven to death.
(He says the last five words, not impatiently, but with a certain
solemn deliberation.) I must go at once to Mrs. Fayth’s house. They
must have carried Mary there--I wish I could spare time to see
Helen!--I’ll go right home as soon as I’ve been to Fayth’s. Odd! How
these brain symptoms last. I must have had quite a blow. I don’t--I
can’t--it is mortifying to feel so confused.

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

(In his absence the street remains deserted.)

Re-enter DR. THORNE.

Enter behind him a tall Woman. (She is
wrapped in a long ash-colored veil, or
mantle, beneath which shows a gleaming
gown of flame-color. She follows
DR. THORNE silently. She keeps at a
distance from him. Her step is a gliding,
stealthy one. The Woman does
not speak.)

DR. THORNE. There must be serious cerebral congestion. I cannot find the
street. I cannot find Fayth’s house. What part of this bewitched town am
I in? I have lost my way--I, Esmerald Thorne, with a clientele of twenty
years from end to end of the city--I cannot find my way.

Enter a Suburban, a Loafer, and a
Priest. (The Woman draws her veil,
and looks solemnly at DR. THORNE
as she passes. Her face is pale and
wretched, but possesses singular
beauty.)

       [Exit the Woman.

(DR. THORNE does not notice the Woman.)

(The Loafer leans against a post. He stares stupidly at the wreck.)

(The Priest walks slowly, reciting an Ave.)

(The Suburban hurries on, making a wide circle to avoid the ruins of
the carriage.)

DR. THORNE (addressing the Suburban). Can you tell me?--Here! Hold on
a minute! Man, can’t you answer a civil question? Will you tell me--

THE SUBURBAN (pays no attention to DR. THORNE, but hurries on.
Consults his watch; speaks.) I shall lose my train!

       [Exit Suburban, running.

DR. THORNE (with puzzled impatience, addressing the Loafer).
Here!--You! Why, it’s Jerry! Just tell me, will you, Jerry, where the
accident was, and how much was the lady hurt?

(The Loafer stares stupidly at DR. THORNE, but makes no answer.)

       [Exit Loafer.

DR. THORNE (with trouble on his face, more gently addresses the
Priest, whom he slightly touches on the arm). Sir!--Oh, Father
Sullivan! Look here, Father! I’m ashamed to confess, I have lost my way.
Would you direct me to the house of the well-known merchant, Frederick
Fayth? I am due there on an urgent professional errand, and--I cannot
explain the phenomenon--but I have lost my way!

(The Priest repeats an Ave under his breath. He looks DR. THORNE
full in the face, but does not reply.)

DR. THORNE. And will you be so kind as to tell me whether you have heard
of a carriage accident down-town--and how much was the lady hurt? Did
you--

PRIEST(looks blindly over DR. THORNE’S head; mutters). Nay--Nay. I
see nothing. (He crosses himself). Ave Sanctissima! Ora pro nobis!
(He lifts his arms and, with a troubled and confused expression, makes
the sign of the cross in the air over DR. THORNE. Priest passes on.)

DR. THORNE (gently). Thank you, Father.

       [Exit Priest.

DR. THORNE (stands sunken in thought for a few moments; suddenly starts
and knots his hands together, then separates them with the motion of one
blind or of one feeling his way in the dark). I must see Helen! I must
go to Helen!--Helen! Helen!

(Sudden darkness settles. When it passes, the wreck of the buggy is
removed.)

Enter DR. THORNE. (Walks rapidly and
perplexedly, still with the manner of a
man who has lost his way.)

       [Exit.


Re-enter.

       [Exit.

Re-enter (speaks).

I must get home. I will get home. I will see Helen! (Stops
sharply, as if smitten by an unseen force; cannot take another step;
contends, as if with an invisible power; droops, as if vanquished;
turns, and retraces his way; his head hangs to his breast. He speaks.)
What thwarts me from my home? Who constrains me from my wife?
(Lifts his face angrily to the sky.) Is this hypnotism? (Laughs
sarcastically.) Am I an infant--or a maniac? It must be anæsthesia
passing off. Perhaps I was etherized by some blank fool after that
shock.--The accident! That is it, of course, of course! It is the
cerebral concussion--a simple case.... I shouldn’t like this to get out.
I believe I’ll go into my office--if I can find my office--and wait till
this passes off. It is a perfectly simple case. (Walks feverishly up
and down the street, searching for his own office; mutters.) Ever since
I yielded to that demand for a noon office hour downtown for business
men--it has crowded me without mercy. If they hadn’t been my old
patients, I wouldn’t have succumbed to it. It’s just another strand in
the whiplash that has driven me to death. Well (draws a long
breath)--I seem to be out of sorts to-night. I shall get over all this
nonsense when I see Helen. Helen will set me right. Helen will make a
live man of me again.
