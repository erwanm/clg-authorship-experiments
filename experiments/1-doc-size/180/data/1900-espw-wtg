man. Who and what are you? Show me what I have to fight, and let me
wrestle for my liberty! Though I am a ghost, let me wrestle like a man!
Let me to my wife! Give way and let me seek her! (Slowly recedes, as if
beaten back; bows his head. The man sobs.)
CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH (chant).
    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     And they that worship Him”--
(Choir breaks off. The organ sounds on.)
(DR. THORNE seems to listen, but with a kind of anger. He slowly
recedes, as if pushed back.)
       [Exit DR. THORNE.
Enter the Veiled Woman. (She stands
mutely and wretchedly. Watches the
house. Wrings her hands, but makes
no sound.)
Enter MRS. THORNE. (Within the house;
can be seen plainly from the street
through the window. She advances
and draws the shade still higher;
stands close to the window, pressing
her hands against the sides of her
eyes; looks out.)
(The Veiled Woman shrinks at the sight of MRS. THORNE.)
       [Exit the Woman.
Reënter DR. THORNE at the other end of the street. (He speaks
shrewdly.) It is nearer at this end. And perhaps, if I didn’t have to
get by that church-- (Hurries up opposite the house. Suddenly he sees
her.) Oh, there’s Helen! God! It is my wife. I--see--my--wife.
(Brokenly.) Dear Helen! (Pushes toward the house. At the foot of his
own steps he falters and falls, still as if beaten back. He struggles as
a man would struggle for his life. The veins stand out on his face and
on his clinched hands. He cries out.) I’m coming, Helen! It is only I,
my girl. Don’t be frightened, dear! I wonder would she be afraid of me?
Perhaps it would shock her. Live people and dead people don’t seem to
understand each other. But I’ll risk it. Helen would go alone and lie
down alive in a grave at midnight, and never look over her shoulder--if
she thought she could see me. I know Helen. I’ll try again. (He
pushes and urges his way onward. But the invisible Power restrains him,
as before. He stretches his arms towards the lighted window.) Here I
am, Helen! I can’t get any farther, somehow.... Come and open the door
for me, my girl,--the way you used to do. Won’t you, Helen? With the boy
in your arms? Perhaps if you opened the door,--I could get in. I ...
(After a silence.) I won’t stay very long. I won’t trouble you any,
Helen. I know I don’t belong there any more. I won’t intrude.
(Wistfully.) Helen! I was cruel to you. I have been ashamed of myself.
I thought if I could get in long enough to say-- (Reflects.) Mary
Fayth went back to see Fred. Nothing prevented her--
(MRS. THORNE throws open the window. Leans out and looks about.)
(MAGGIE is seen moving about the lighted room.)
(People in the street pass.)
(MRS. THORNE hastily shuts the window.)
DR. THORNE (piteously). Helen!
(The organ sounds from the church.)
DR. THORNE (turns suddenly, as if turning on an antagonist). What art
Thou that dost withstand me? I am a dead and helpless man. What
wouldst Thou with me? Where gainest Thou thy force upon me? Art Thou
verily that ancient Myth that men were wont to call Almighty God? (He
lifts his face to the sky; holds up his hands as if he held up a
question or an argument.)
CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH:--
    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     They that worship Him
     Must worship Him in Spirit”--
MAGGIE (opens the door. The lighted hall is seen behind). There’s
nobody here, Mrs. Thorne.
(MRS. THORNE, wearing a slight, white shawl which falls from her as she
moves, comes to the open door; motions MAGGIE away.)
       [Exit MAGGIE.
MRS. THORNE (softly). Esmerald? He might be out there in the dark. Who
knows what spirits do? Esmerald? Would God that I had died for you! Oh,
my dear!
DR. THORNE. Helen!
MRS. THORNE. If he were there he would answer me if it cost him his
living soul.
DR. THORNE. Helen, I answer you, for I am a living soul. Helen! (He
struggles mightily; crawls up the steps, reaches with the tips of his
fingers the fringe of her white shawl, which has fallen down the steps,
and lies there unnoticed.) Helen, look down! Down. (He clutches the
white fringe to his lips. He kisses it wildly.)
(MRS. THORNE lifts her face to the sky.)
DR. THORNE. I can’t get any higher,--not any nearer, dear.
MRS. THORNE. There is no one here. (Weeping.) There is nothing here.
(She shuts the door slowly and reluctantly; remembers the shawl, which
she draws in with her.)
(DR. THORNE clings to the shawl in vain. Moaning, he kisses the
doorsteps of his own home where the garment had touched them.)
END OF SCENE II.
SCENE III.
A narrow defile or pass between high mountains.
The light is dim. The pass winds irregularly, and is
often rough, but is always upwards. The scenery is
unearthly. No sign of life is to be seen. A distant
storm can be heard.
Enter DR. THORNE (slowly, holding a
staff; he is robed in purple, a flowing
garment, not unlike a talith or a toga.
His face, still pale, is heavily lined;
but more with anxiety than with resentment;
its expression is somewhat
softer. He speaks).
DR. THORNE. I wonder what is to be done with me next? I see no
particular reason for climbing these mountains. There seems to be
nothing for a dead man to do but to obey orders. Well (candidly), I’ve
given my share of them in my time. I suppose it’s fair enough to turn
about and take a few--now. (He smiles. After a pause, climbing
slowly.) I must say I can’t call this an attractive country--so far.
Its main features are not genial.
(The storm increases; there is thunder and cloud.)
DR. THORNE (looking about). It seems to be in the cyclonic belt.
There’s a storm of some sort,--I should say two of them fighting up in
these hills. Hear them close and clinch! Like a man’s two natures;
civil war all the time. And no truce! (Muses.) It’s not a social
region, certainly. I don’t know that I recall, really, ever being in a
place that was so desolate. There isn’t so much as a wild animal, nor a
bird flying over. It reminds me of--what was it? I can’t recall the
words. It seems to me my mother taught them to me when I was a little
lad. But they have quite gone. Beautiful literature in that old Book!
It’s a good while since I’ve dipped into it. I’ve had too much to do.
What was it?
    “Though I walk--When I walk”--
(He breaks off; climbs stoutly. The storm darkens down. For the first
time DR. THORNE’S face expresses something like alarm. He looks about
like a man who would call for help, but is too proud to do so. He
speaks.)
This is really growing serious. I wish I could remember those words. Now
I think of it, we were on our knees. A most unnatural posture! My
mother was a sweet saint,--rest her pure spirit! (It lightens as he
says this.)
VOICES FROM BEYOND (softly chanting).
    “And when I’m lost in deep despair
       Be thou with me....
     Until life’s daylight ended be,
     Be thou with me, with me.”
DR. THORNE (lifts his head to listen). There’s a good musical taste in
this country, at all events. That’s something. What were those words?
Ah, I have it.
    “Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow
              Thou shalt be with me.”
It went in some such way. (Repeats perplexedly.)
    “Thou shalt be with me?”
(Sadly.) A beautiful superstition.
(The storm comes on heavily, with darkness and lightning. Through the
gloom his solitary form can be seen manfully climbing. He exhibits no
panic, but his evident bewilderment grows upon him. He mutters.)
The desolation of desolations! I shall be glad when I get out of it.
What solitude! Of all the people I have known--dead or living--there is
not one to stay by me.
VOICES FROM BEYOND.
    “Be Thou near him!”
Enter, on the pass above him, a young
girl repeating prayers on a rosary.
She is a plain, unattractive girl, folded
in a dull gray gown that wraps her
loosely. Her face is earnest and devout.
DR. THORNE. Why, Norah!
NORAH (looking back). Oh, it is the Doctor.
DR. THORNE. I can’t overtake you, Norah.
NORAH. And I’ve only died the day.
DR. THORNE. But you’ve got the start of me, Norah. You are higher up. I
am glad to see you, Norah (eagerly). But I can’t reach you.
NORAH (holds down her hand). Come up, Doctor! Come up! I’ll help you,
Doctor.
DR. THORNE (gratefully). Thank you, Norah.
NORAH. It’s to Purrgatory I’d be goin’. But you’re the herretic, Doctor.
Which way do you be goin’?
DR. THORNE (shakes his head). I don’t know, Norah. You are wiser than
I am--in this foreign place.
NORAH (holds down her hand). The dear Doctor! Ye were that kind to me,
Doctor,--at the hospital, and forninst the house where I was worrkin’.
It’s niver a cint I had to pay yez for yer thruble. If I’d been a pretty
lady with a purrse of gold, ye never could have put yerself about more
than ye did for the likes of me. It’s not meself that would have died
the day if you’d been there. Doctor? Would yez mind, if I
should--bless you, Doctor? There’s kindness onto kindness, and mercy
goin’ after mercy that ye did me, all hidin’ in a poor girrl’s heart to
rise and meet you here. I was sick an’ ye did visit me.
DR. THORNE (melting). When did I ever show you all that kindness,
Norah? I don’t remember--
