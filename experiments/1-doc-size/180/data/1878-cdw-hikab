ing and lolling out their tongues, came swinging along, 
keeping the trail, like stupids, and consequently los- 
ing ground when the deer doubled. But, when the 





doe had got into the timber, she heard the savage 
brutes howling across the meadow. (It is well 
enough, perhaps, to say that nobody offered to shoot 
the dogs.) 

The courage of the panting fugitive was not gone : 
she was game to the tip of her high-bred ears. But 
the fearful pace at which she had just been going told 
on her. Her legs trembled, and her heart beat like a 
trip-hammer. She slowed her speed perforce, but still 
fled industriously up the right bank of the stream. 
When she had gone a couple of miles, and the dogs 
were evidently gaining again, she crossed the broad, 
deep brook, climbed the steep, left bank, and fled on 
in the direction of the Mount Marcy trail. The ford- 
ing of the river threw the hounds off for a time. She 
knew, by their uncertain yelping up and down the op- 
posite bank, that she had a little respite : she used it, 
however, to push on until the baying was faint in her 
ears ; and then she dropped, exhausted, upon the 
ground. 

This rest, brief as it was, saved her life. Roused 
again by the baying pack, she leaped forward with 
better speed, though without that keen feeling of ex- 
hilarating flight that she had in the morning. It was 
still a race for life ; but the odds were in her favor, 
she thought. She did not appreciate the dogged 
persistence of the hounds, nor had any inspiration 
told her that the race is not to the swift. She was a 
little confused in her mind where to go ; but an in- 
stinct kept her course to the left, and consequently far- 
ther away from her fawn. Going now slower, and now 
faster, as the pursuit seemed more distant or nearer, 
she kept to the south-west, crossed the stream again, 
left Panther Gorge on her right, and ran on by Hay- 





stack and Skylight in the direction of the Upper 
Ausable Pond. I do not know her exact course 
through this maze of mountains, swamps, ravines, and 
frightful wildernesses. I only know that the poor 
thing woi^ked her way along painfully, with sinking 
heart and unsteady limbs, lying down " dead-beat " at 
intervals, and then spurred on by the cry of the re- 
morseless dogs, until, late in the afternoon she stag- 
gered down the shoulder of Bartlett, and stood upon 
the shore of the lake. If she could put that piece of 
water between her and her pursuers, she would be 
safe. Had she strength to swim it ? 

At her first step into the water she saw a sight that 
send her back with a bound. There was a boat mid- 
lake ; two men were in it. One was rowing : the other 
had a gun in his hand. They were looking towards 
her : they had seen her. (She did not know that they 
had heard the baying of hounds on the mountains, 
and had been lying in wait for her an hour.) What 
should she do ? The hounds were drawing near. 
No escape that way, even if she could still run. 
With only a moment's hesitation she plunged into the 
lake, and struck obliquely across. Her tired legs 
could not propel the tired body rapidly. She saw the 
boat headed for her. She turned towards the centre 
of the lake. The boat turned. She could hear the 
rattle of the oar-locks. It was gaining on her. Then 
there was a silence. Then there was a splash of the 
water just ahead of her, followed by a roar round the 
lake, the words " Confound it all ! " and a rattle of 
the oars again. The doe saw the boat nearing her. 
She turned irresolutely to the shore whence she came: 
the dogs were lapping the water, and howling there. 
She turned again to the centre of the lake. 



The brave, pretty creature was quite exhausted now. 
In a moment more, with a rush of water, the boat was 
on her, and the man at the oars had leaned over and 
caught her by the tail. 

'^ Knock her on the head with that paddle!" he 
shouted to the gentleman in the stern. 

The gentleman was a gentleman, with a kind, 
smooth-shaven face, and might have been a minister 
of some sort of everlasting gospel. He took the pad- 
dle in his hand. Just then the doe turned her head, 
and looked at him with her great, appealing eyes. 

" I can't do it ! my soul, I can't do it ! " and he 
dropped the paddle. '' Oh, let her go ! " 

" Let thunder go ! " was the only response of the 
guide as he slung the deer round, whipped out his 
hunting-knife, and made a pass that severed her jug- 
ular. 

And the gentleman ate that night of the venison. 

The buck returned about the middle of the after- 
noon. The fawn was bleating piteously, hungry and 
lonesome. The buck was surprised. He looked about 
in the forest. He took a circuit and came back. His 
doe was nowhere to be seen. He looked down at the 
fawn in a helpless sort of way. The fawn appealed 
for his supper. The buck had nothing whatever to 
give his child, — nothing but his sympathy. If he 
said anything, this is what he said : " I 'm the head of 
this family ; but, really, this is a novel case. I 've 
nothing whatever for you. I don't know what to do. 
I Ve the feelings of a father ; but you can't live on 
them. Let us travel." 

The buck walked away : the little one toddled after 
him. They disappeared in the forest. , 



There has been a lively inquiry after the primeval 
man. Wanted, a man who would satisfy the conditions 
of the miocene environment, and yet would be good 
enough for an ancestor. We are not particular about 
our ancestors, if they are sufficiently remote ; but we 
must have something. Failing to apprehend the pri- 
meval man, science has sought the primitive man where 
he exists as a survival in present savage races. He is, 
at best, only a mushroom growth of the recent period 
(came in, probably, with the general raft of mamma- 
lian fauna) ; but he possesses yet some rudimentary 
traits that may be studied. 

It is a good mental exercise to try to fix the mind 
on the primitive man divested of all the attributes he 
has acquired in his struggles with the other mammalian 
fauna. Fix the mind on an orange, the ordinary occu- 
pation of the metaphysician : take from it. without eat- 
ing it, odor, color, weight, form, substance, and peel ; 
then let the mind still dwell on it as an orange. The 
experiment is perfectly successful; only, at the end 
of it, you haven't any mind. Better still, consider the 
telephone : take away from it the metallic disk, and 
the magnetized iron, and the connecting wire, and then 
let the mind run abroad on the telephone. The mind 
won't come back. I have tried by this sort of process 
to get a conception of the primitive man. I let the 



mind roam away back over the vast geologic spaces, 
and sometimes fancy I see a dim image of him stalking 
across the terrace epoch of the quaternary period. 

But this is an unsatisfying pleasure. The best results 
are obtained by studying the primitive man as he is 
left here and there in our era, a witness of what has 
been ; and I find him most to my mind in the Adiron- 
dack system of what geologists call the Champlain 
epoch. I suppose the primitive man is one who owes 
more to nature than to the forces of civilization. 
What we seek in him are the primal and original 
traits, unmixed with the sophistications of society, and 
unimpaired by the refinements of an artificial culture. 
He would retain the primitive instincts, which are 
cultivated out of the ordinary, commonplace man. I 
should expect to find him, by reason of an unrelin- 
quished kinship, enjoying a special communion with 
nature, — admitted to its mysteries, understanding its 
moods, and able to predict its vagaries. He would be
