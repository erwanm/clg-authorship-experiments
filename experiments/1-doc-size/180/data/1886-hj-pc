had never before had a visitor who practised so racy a 
frankness, or who, indeed, had so curious a story to tell. 
She had never before so completely failed, and her failure 
greatly interested her, especially as it seemed now to be 
turning a little to success. She had succeeded promptly 
with every one, and the sign of it was that every one had 
rendered her a monotony of homage. Even poor little 
Hyacinth had tried, in the beginning, to say sweet things 
to her. This very different type of man appeared to have 
his thoughts fixed on anything but sweetness ; she felt the 
liveliest hope that he would move further and further away 
from it. ' I remember what you asked me what good it 
would do you. I couldn't tell you then ; and though I now 
have had a long time to turn it over, I haven't thought of 
it yet.' 

'Oh, but I hope it will do me some,' said Paul. 'A 
fellow wants a reward, when he has made a great effort.' 

' It does me some,' the Princess remarked, gaily. 

' Naturally, the awkward things I say amuse you. But 
I don't say them for that, but just to give you an 
idea. 3 

' You give me a great many ideas. Besides, I know you 
already a good deal.' 

' From little Robinson, I suppose,' said Muniment. 

The Princess hesitated. ' More particularly from Lady 
Aurora.' 

' Oh, she doesn't know much about me ! ' the young man 
exclaimed. 

' It's a pity you say that, because she likes you.' 

( Yes, she likes me,' Muniment replied, serenely. 

Again the Princess hesitated. ' And I hope you like her.'

' Ay, she's a dear old girl ! ' 

The Princess reflected that her visitor was not a gentle- 
man, like Hyacinth ; but this made no difference in her 
present attitude. The expectation that he would be a 
gentleman had had nothing to do with her interest in 
him ; that, in fact, had rested largely on the supposition 
that he had a rich plebeian strain. 'I don't know that 
there is any one in the world I envy so much,' she 
remarked; an observation which her visitor received in 
silence. ' Better than any one I have ever met she has 
solved the problem which, if we are wise, we all try 
to solve, don't we? of getting out of herself. She has 
got out of herself more perfectly than any one I have 
ever known. She has merged herself in the passion of 
doing something for others. That's why I envy her,' 
said the Princess, with an explanatory smile, as if per- 
haps he didn't understand her. ' 

'It's an amusement, like any other,' said Paul Muni- 
ment. 

' Ah, not like any other ! It carries light into dark 
places ; it makes a great many wretched people con- 
siderably less wretched.' 

'How many, eh?' asked the young man, not exactly 
as if he wished to dispute, but as if it were always in 
him to enjoy an argument. 

The Princess wondered why he should desire to argue 
at Lady Aurora's expense. ' Well, one who is very near 
to you, to begin with.' 

' Oh, she's kind, most kind ; it's altogether wonderful. 
But Rosy makes her considerably less wretched,' Paul 
Muniment rejoined. 





' Very likely, of course ; and so she does me.' 
' May I inquire what you are wretched about ? ' Muni- 
ment went on. 

'About nothing at all. That's the worst of it. But 
I am much happier now than I have ever been.' 
' Is that also about nothing ?' 

' No, about a sort of change that has taken place in 
my life. I have been able to do some little things.' 

' For the poor, I suppose you mean. Do you refer 
to the presents you have made to Rosy ? ' the young man 
inquired. 

' The presents ? ' The Princess appeared not to re- 
member. ' Oh, those are trifles. It isn't anything one 
has been able to give ; it's some talks one has had, some 
convictions one has arrived at.' 

'Convictions are a source of very innocent pleasure,' 
said the young man, smiling at his interlocutress with his 
bold, pleasant eyes, which seemed to project their glance 
further than any she had seen. 

'Having them is nothing. It's the acting on them,' 
the Princess replied. 

' Yes ; that doubtless, too, is good.' He continued to 
look at her peacefully, as if he liked to consider that this 
might be what she had asked him to come for. He said 
nothing more, and she went on : 

' It's far better, of course, when one is a man.' 
' I don't know. Women do pretty well what they like. 
My sister and you have managed, between you, to bring me 
to this.' 

'It's more your sister, I suspect, than I. But why, 
after all, should you have disliked so much to come ? ' 






 

' Well, since you ask me,' said Paul Muniment, ' I will 
tell you frankly, though I don't mean it uncivilly, that 
I don't know what to make of you.' 

' Most people don't,' returned the Princess. ' But they 
usually take the risk.' 

' Ah, well, I'm the most prudent of men.' 

' I was sure of it ; that is one of the reasons why I 
wanted to know you. I know what some of your ideas are 
Hyacinth Robinson has told me ; and the source of my 
interest in them is partly the fact that you consider very 
carefully what you attempt.' 

' That I do I do,' said Muniment, simply. 

The tone in which he said this would have been almost 
ignoble, as regards a kind of northern canniness which it 
expressed, had it not been corrected by the character of his 
face, his youth and strength, and his military eye. The 
Princess recognised both the shrewdness and the latent 
audacity as she rejoined, ' To do anything with you would 
be very safe. It would be sure to succeed.' 

' That's what poor Hyacinth thinks,' said Paul Muni- 
ment. 

The Princess wondered a little that he could allude in 
that light tone to the faith their young friend had placed in 
him, considering the consequences such a trustfulness 
might yet have ; but this curious mixture of qualities could 
only make her visitor, as a tribune of the people, more 
interesting to her. She abstained for the moment from 
touching on the subject of Hyacinth's peculiar position, and 
only said, 'Hasn't he told you about me? Hasn't he 
explained me a little ? ' 

' Oh, his explanations are grand ! ' Muniment ex-
