other. Unless, where both are alike uninteresting; which I cannot suppose is my case." 

" No," said Dolly laughing a little, " but I suppose you will tell me things by degrees, without 
my asking." 

" What makes you suppose that ? " 

" It would be natural, wouldn't it ? " 

" Would it be natural, without your shewing any 
interest ? " 

"Ah, but now you are supposing. Perhaps I 
should shew interest." 

Sandie laughed now heartily. 

" I will try you," said he. " I will begin and tell 
you something without questions asked. Dolly, I 
have a house." 

" Have you ? " 

" You do not care to hear about it ? " 

" I am glad that you have a house," said Dolly 
demurely. Sandie was lying on the turfy bank, in 
a convenient position for looking up into her eyes; 
and she found it not precisely an easy position 
for her. 

" You do not take it as a matter of personal 
concern ? " 

" It is a house a long way off," said Dolly. " Just 
now we are here.'' 

" How much longer do you expect to be here ? " 

" That I do not know at all. Mother and I have 
tried and tried to get father to go home again, 
and we cannot move him." 

" I must try," said Mr. Shubrick. 



 

" if you could! " said Dolly clasping her hands 
unconsciously. " I don't know what I would give. 
He seems to mind you more than anybody." 

" What keeps him here ? Business ? " 

"I suppose it is partly business," said Dolly 
slowly, not knowing quite how to answer. And 
then darted into her heart with a pang of doubt 
and pain, the question: was not Mr. Shubrick 
entitled to know what kept her father in England, 
and the whole miserable truth of it ? She had 
been so occupied and so happy these last days, she 
had never fairly faced the question before. It 
almost caught her breath away. 

" Dolly, when we all go back to America, the 
house I speak of will not be ' far off.' " 

" No " said Dolly faintly. 

" Look here," said he taking one of her hands. 
"It is a house I hope you will like. I like it, 
though it has no pretension whatever. It is an 
old house; and the ground belonging to it has 
been in the possession of my family for a hundred 
years; the house itself is not quite so old. But 
the trees about it are. The old house stands shut 
up and empty. I told you, 'I have no one very 
near of kin left to me; so even when I am at home 
I do not go there. I have never lived there since 
my mother left it." 

Dolly was silent. 

" Now, how soon do you think I may have the 
house opened and put in order, for living in ? " 

There came up a lovely rose colour in the cheeks 



 

he was looking at ; however Dolly answered with 
praiseworthy steadiness 

"That is a matter for you to consider." 

"Is it?" 

" Certainly." 

" But you know it would be no use to open it, 
until somebody is ready to live there." 

" No," said Dolly. " Of course I suppose not." 

"So you see, after all I have to come to you 
with questions, seeing you will ask me none." 

" 0," said Dolly, " I will ask you questions, if 
you will let me. I would rather ask than answer." 

"Very well," said he laughing. "I give place 
to you. Ask what you like." 

Then followed silence. The young officer lay 
easily on the bank at her feet, holding Dolly's hand ; 
sometimes bringing his eyes to bear upon her face, 
sometimes letting them rove elsewhere; amused, 
but waiting. 

" I shall have to begin again," said he. 

" No, don't," said Dolly. " Mr. Shubrick, where 
is your house ? " 

"About fifty miles from Boston, in one of the 
prettiest New England villages on the coast." 

" And how much ground is there round it ? " 

"About a hundred acres." 

" Doesn't it spoil a house to be shut up so ? " 

"It is not good for it. But there is nobody belonging to me that I would like to see in it ; and 
I could never rent the old place. I am very fond 
of it, Dolly. It is full of associations to me." 



 

It swept through Dolly, how she would like 
to put it in order and keep it open for him ; and 
again she was silent, till admonished by a laughing " Go on." 

But Dolly did not know what further to say, 
and was still silent. 

"There is one question you have not asked me," 
Mr. Shubrick said, " which would be a very pertinent one just now. You have never asked me how 
long I was going to stay in England." 

" No," said Dolly starting. " How soon must 
you How long can you stay ? " 

"My leave expires in two weeks." 

" Two weeks ! And can you not get it extended ? " 

" I don't know. Perhaps, for a little. But Dolly, there is a prospect of the 'Red Chief being 
ordered home; and there is a further possibility 
that I may have to take her home; for Captain 
Busby is very much out of health and wants to 
stay the winter over in Naples." 

"You may have to take her home. Will that 
give you the ship, do you mean ? " 

"No," said he smiling; "ships are not had at 
such an easy rate as that. But Dolly, you perceive 
that there are several questions we must ask and 
answer; and the sooner the better." 

"Then," said Dolly a little hurriedly, she was 
afraid of the questions that might be coming, " if 
you go away in two or three weeks, when shall I
