to the gate, early in a September afternoon. Ida smiled faintly. The
parting of the morrow, was, to her, the death of a summer's day, to
be succeeded by wintry darkness. Not even Carry knew how the prospect
oppressed her.

Lynn saw that his remark was injudicious, and endeavoured to atone
for it, by the most delicate assiduity of attention. Their liking had
matured into an attachment, which might have been predicated upon their
consonance of feeling and sentiment. Her calmer judgment gave her the
ascendancy, which belonged of right, to the masculine mind; he did not
look up--she could not have respected him if he had; but he consulted
and appealed to her, as a brother would ask counsel of an elder sister.
She learned to imitate Charley, in curbing his impetuosity; and he
chafed less at her soft touch upon the rein. No bantering checked the
growth of their friendship; they were, for the time, members of one
family; Lynn and Charley were no more to the disengaged young lady than
Arthur.

Their excursion was to a splendid mansion, fifteen miles from
Poplar-grove, lately completed, and not yet occupied by a wealthy
landed proprietor, the Croesus of the county. Arthur had seen it, and
carried home such a report of its stately grandeur, that a visit was
forthwith projected. Nature was in one of her richest autumnal moods.

"She dies, as a queen should--in royal robes,"--said Lynn. "Note the
purple haze upon those hills, and the yellow glory that bathes the
foreground! I would sacrifice this right arm, could I first transfer
that light to canvass. Loveliness like this maddens me with a Tantalus
frenzy. To think that it must fade, when it should be immortal! I would
have it ever before me."

"It lives in your memory. That is a pleasure, time nor distance
diminishes."

"I am not satisfied with this selfish hoarding. A voice is ever urging
me on,--'Create! create!' it cries; and while my pencil moves, I am a
creator; exulting in the pictures graven upon my soul, as no parent
ever joyed over a beloved child. 'They are mine--mine!' I repeat in
an ecstacy. I have wept above--almost worshipped them! Then comes the
chill, grey light of critical reason, as when you awake at morning, and
see things as they are: the soul-pictures are beauteous still:--my
copy the veriest daub!"

"The keenness of your disappointment is an augury of success. The
lithography is perfect--you must not despond at the failure of one
proof-impression. Your mortification is a greater triumph than the
complacency with which a mediocre genius surveys his work."

"You remember Sheridan's maiden speech," said Charley.

"I have read of Demosthenes'," replied Lynn.

"Sheridan's was a similar case. He was hooted at for his presumption;
his first and second attempts were wretched: and his friends advised
him to retire from the rostrum forever. 'Never!' said he, striking his
breast. 'It is here, and shall come out!'"

"A glorious 'coming out' it was!" responded Ida. "What do you say
now?"--to Lynn.

"That it is here!" returning her bright look. "Was ever man more
blessed in his friends? More fortunate than Adam, I take my guardian
angels with me, from the Paradise I leave to-morrow."

"You must array one in a less questionable shape, if you would have men
admit his angelic relationship," said Charley, with a grimace. "What
are you looking at?"

Lynn did not reply. They were upon a hill; and some object in the
valley beneath fastened his gaze. The pensive cast of his features
bordered upon gloom, as they neared it. Ida saw only a graceful
knoll, bounded, except towards the west, by a chain of more imposing
eminences. A monarch oak stood in isolated sovereignty upon its
summit; it had shaded a dwelling, for one chimney yet remained; and
the sickly herbage of the slope was not the produce of a virgin soil.
Lynn stopped. Not a word was spoken, his eyes were too full of tender
sadness; the man--not the artist, looked from them.

"A lonely tree, and a desolate hearth-stone!" muttered he. "It is
prophetic!"

"Is the spot known to you?" asked Ida, gently, as they rode on.

"It was my birth-place."

"I had forgotten;" said Charley. "You were very young when you left it."

"But I remember it. I could point out to you the very place where my
mother taught me to walk;--a grass-plat before the door:--she upon
the step, my father kneeling at a short distance, and each tempting
me to undertake the journey from one to the other. They are gone!
parents, brother, sisters! there is but one puny scion of a noble line
remaining!"

Ida turned her face away. The sad story everywhere! Was there
justice--there was not mercy--in thus rending away the sweetest
comforts man can know,--while avarice, and pride and malevolence rioted
in unharmed luxuriance. Earth was a cheat, and happiness a lie!

"This is a fine piece of road," said Charley, "and we are jogging over
it, like Quakers going to market. I say! Art.!"

"Well!" answered his brother, who was some yards in advance.

"Don't you think your Rosinante would be benefitted by a taste of the
spur?"

Oh! the delight of a sweeping gallop in the open country! the elate
consciousness of strength and liberty, as the magnificent animal
beneath you exerts every thew and sinew in obedience to your voice and
hand; you and he together forming one resistless power, free as the
rushing air--able to overleap or bear down any obstacle! The jocund
tones wafted back by the breeze attested the efficacy of Charley's
prescription.

"That bend hides 'the Castle;'" called out Arthur.

"I will be the first to see it!" exclaimed Carry, and as the turning
was gained, she raised herself from the saddle. It was an unguarded
moment;--the horse circled the bend in a run; and she was thrown
directly in the road of the trampling hoofs behind. Charley's horse
fell back upon his haunches;--there was giant might in the hand that
reined him;--an inch nearer, and she was lost! for his fore-feet grazed
her shoulder.

"My dearest love!" cried the agitated Arthur, raising her in his arms.
"Thank God! you are not killed!"

"I am not hurt, dear Arthur! you are all so frightened! it was very
careless in me. Indeed I do not require support--I am not injured in
the least!"

"Are you sure?" questioned Ida, anxiously: "or do you say it for our
sakes?"

"I was never more free from pain. And I am able and ready to go on!"

"You were her saviour!" Arthur griped his brother's hand, with a
trembling lip.

"No thanks! I would not run down a cow or sheep if I could help it."

Arthur's even temper was tried by this speech, and the more, that it
wounded Carry.

"Coarse! unfeeling!" thought Ida. She grudged him the eloquent
affection of Lynn's glance. "I do not care to go further;" said she,
when Carry was reseated.

"What! turn back within sight of the Promised Land?" said Carry. "Do
not cause me to feel that I have spoiled your afternoon's pleasure!
Oscar and I will not part company again so unceremoniously,--will we,
old fellow? Allons!" and she shook the reins gaily. The rest followed
with reluctance, and for awhile, very soberly. The thought of what
might have been the result of the accident, she treated so lightly,
precluded jest, and they would not speak of it seriously. By tacit
consent, it was not referred to again. Lynn recovered himself first;
he forgot everything but the fair domain they were entering; and his
raptures awakened the others to its attractions. The house was a
princely pile, rearing its towers from the midst of a finely-wooded
park. The architecture was Gothic, and perfect in all its parts, even
to the stained windows, imported, at an immense expense, from abroad.
A village at the base of the hill, was peopled by the negroes, of
whom there were more than an hundred connected with the plantation.
The equestrians rode up the single street. Good humour and neatness
characterised the simple inhabitants; children drew to one side of the
road, with smiles and courtesies; the aged raised their bleared eyes,
to reply to the respectful salutations of the young riders; through
the open doors were seen clean, comfortably-furnished rooms;--in most,
the tables were spread for the evening meal, and the busy housewives
preparing for their husband's return from field or forest.

"These are thy down-trodden children, O Africa!" said Ida,
sarcastically.

Lynn fired up. "They are the happiest beings upon the globe."

"So far as animal wants are concerned," subjoined Arthur.

"I do not accept of that clause. They are happy! They have a kind and
