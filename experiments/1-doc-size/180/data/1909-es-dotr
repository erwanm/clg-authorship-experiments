The man bowed Welden out, after which 
he put the letter on the hall table where, later 
that afternoon, Maud letting herself in with 
a latch-key as was her custom, found and 
read it. 
Welden then was on his way to Chicago. 
The press there supplied him with fresh 
news from Santa Barbara, at Omaha there 
was more. But thereon, over the plains and 
through the hamlets which in a sort of horrible coquetry vie in hideousness with each 
other, there was a silence that continued 
until Ogden was reached. 
Ogden too has its coquetries. But the 
news of the day may be had there. There 
is also a stop. 
The stop is brief, yet it sufficed for Wel 
den. He wired to Maud, got his trunks from 
the baggage car, his bags from the Pullman 
and boarded a returning train. 
In a Salt Lake sheet he had read that, the 
 
prosecution collapsing, Perkins had been released. It was then that he wired. The wire 
was a request that his letter should not be 
opened. Four days later he was in New 
York. 
On the evening of that fourth day, a bit 
fatigued, the motion of the train actively 
continuing in his head, but in a white tie, a 
white waistcoat between which two small 
black studs served to indicate his recent 
mourning he was again in Madison ave 
nue, this time in the parlour, as the local 
drawing-room is sometimes called and on 
this occasion very properly, for a parlour or 
parloir is a talking place and Welden found 
himself called upon to say more than he had 
expected, and on a subject at that concerning 
which he had not intended to talk at all. 
Maud was not present when he entered 
and he looked at the faded frescoes with a 
yawn. In a moment however, from the din 
ing-room beyond, the girl appeared. 
Her neck and arms were bare. Her gown 
was white, striated with violet. As she entered she stooped to arrange or to release afold. The attitude, but momentarily maintained, was so graceful that Welden forgot 
his fatigue. Then, as she straightened and 
approached, one hand just upholding a hem, 
the picture she presented indemnified him 
for the little horrors of the trip. 
The week previous he saw that she had 
altered. Now he realised that she had 
changed again. It was as though when 
bending at the door, her whole manner had 
unbent. 
She took his hand. "Dearest, another 
would say that what you went from here to 
do was noble. I do not. It was You." 
Passably perplexed, Welden stared. In 
the stare the perplexity was reflected. 
The girl smiled. Her hand still in his, 
she led him to the S in upholstery, in one of 
the curves of which she seated herself while 
 
he, guided by her, seated himself in the 
other. 
"Dearest, will you promise me some 
thing?" 
Welden nodded. 
"Will you promise not to he annoyed?" 
Welden nodded again. 
"I must tell you, then, that I have read 
your letter." 
Vexation lifted Welden visibly like a 
lash. He dropped the hand he held, sprang 
from the seat and went to the window. 
On reaching it he turned. Maud was look 
ing at him. 
"Your promise!" 
Welden ran his long, thin fingers through 
his bright thick hair. 
"Your promise!" 
"But, Maud, I am not annoyed. Annoy 
ance is not the term. If anything, I am 
alarmed." 
At that the girl also left her seat. Advancing to where he stood she said in his 
face: "It is the first time then in all your 
life." 
Welden, moving uneasily, turned away. 
"Dearest, can you not trust me? Even if 
I had not read the letter, sooner or later I 
would have known." 
With the goaded action of a bull before 
the matador, Welden tossed his head. 
"No, never, unless " He stopped, 
looked at her, weighed her. "Unless matters 
had gone the other way. It was only in 
provision of the contingency that I wrote 
you and when I did, I expressly instructed 
William that you were not to read the letter 
until you heard from me again." 
"Yes, so he told me after I had read it. 
I am not sorry, nor should you be. No 
earthly thing could have brought us nearer. 
Dearest, do you not see that between us now 
it is for always?" 
"You mean that?" 
 
"Mean it ! If you wish, I will go with you 
to-night. The world will say that I am your 
mistress, but I would rather be that than 
empress to an emperor." 
"Dona Sol!" Welden, with assumed light 
ness, threw out. 
"Dona Sol, yes, if you like, and Heloise 
also, for both said it. With them, though, it 
was heroics; with me it is the truth." 
Welden took her hands in his. "Suppos 
ing I put you to the test?" 
"Give me only time to get a cloak, and 
for William to call a cab." 
"I don't mean that. I mean a greater 
test." 
"Is there any?" 
Welden nodded. "Will you marry me?" 
Maud laughed in his face. "Do you call 
that a test? Do you?" 
Welden, a bit relieved, laughed also. 
"Well, you see," he said, "heretofore it 
has rather seemed one. I give you my word 
I had no idea but that you would refuse me." 
Maud turned, surveying the room. Then, 
assured that they were quite alone, she dis 
engaged her hands, put them on his shoul 
ders and raising herself, whispered: 
"What girl would refuse a man who loved 
her enough to kill another woman for her? 
Dearest, I adore you." 
Welden drew her to him. Presently, as 
he held her in his arms, he said: "I hope 
you destroyed that agreeable information?" 
With a smile the girl freed herself. 
"Completely," she answered. 
Then taking him again by the hand she 
led him back to where they had been seated. 
There, after a moment, she added: "Dearest, tell me about it. Did Sally know before 
hand?" 
"Now, Maud," he protested, "don't be 
morbid." 
But naively this girl in whom there was 
so little naivete persisted. 
 
"Dearest, tell me this; was it because of 
the letter you killed her?" 
"I killed her for what she killed in me, 
for her assassination of my belief in you. 
That was more to me than life, and for it I 
took hers." 
Maud thought it over. But still the epi 
sode of the letter rankled. 
"What did she do when she found you 
had my note?" 
"What did she do?" Welden repeated, 
"Personally she did nothing. But the most 
curious of all physical phenomena manifested itself in her. The red phantom of the 
human conscience appeared in her face. 
She flushed with a flame that came to her 
from hell." 
Maud contemplated the picture. It 
seemed to her over coloured. With a ques 
tion she toned it. 
"Don't you suppose that she was merely 
angry at herself for having kept the note? 
I cannot conceive what folly prompted her 
to do so." 
"A folly that is common enough," Weiden answered. "Almost all criminals leave 
or preserve some evidence of their guilt. 
There is an uncontrollable impulse which 
compels them." 
Maud smiled. "Thank fortune, that impulse did not actuate my criminal. Did it, 
dearest?" 
"Oh, but it did though. You read about
