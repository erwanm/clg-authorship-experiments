"Are you trying a charm? " he inquired. 

"Yes. Telling my fortune." Another drop went 
down very softly and the bowl of the spoon trembled 
slightly. 





"That is two years," she said, recklessly, "and that 
three." 

Down went the spoon. 

"I cannot marry under three years," with confident 
emphasis. "I am glad women have outgrown the no- 
tion that they must be married at twenty. I think thirty 
would be better." 

" Try it for me." 

" O, you must try for yourself. It would not be your 
fortune." 

Sherburne's attempts were ludicrously futile. 

"Well, it doesn't matter," he said, in a tone of dis- 
gust. " The great thing is your fortune. And in three 
years " 

Mr. Murray's mellow laugh floated across to them, 
and there was a sudden disintegration of the group. 
Several were coming over for a farewell cup of tea. 

"Uncle Con has won his point whatever it is," said 
Sherburne. " Did you ever remark how often he does 
it? And he isn't real aggressive, either." 

' ' Another cup of your nice tea, if you please, Miss 
Maurice. And Miss Gaines will you indulge — " said 
one of the guests, pausing at the table. 

" If you won't quote the old adage, for / think tea 
does inebriate if you drink enough. And brandy might 
not if you put a teaspoonful in a glass of water," re- 
turned the lady. 

"Which side won?" asked Miss Maurice, with a 
smile that looked like fervent interest. 

" O, it was a sort of draw game, as arguments usually 
are," returned Mr. Deane. "The ardent believers in 
inspiration are sure an artist must be born, like a poet, 
the steady going plodding people with an immense 





amount of ambition believe all things possible, and often 
do surprise their friends by their achievements. As for 
me, I consider both necessary. Nothing can be done in 
the long run without labor and perseverance. Does 
making a good cup of tea come from repeated trials of 
how much tea to so much boiling water, Miss Maurice ? " 

"No," answered Gertrude. "It depends largely on 
the quality of the tea, and the taste of the drinker." 

"Then I shall consider my taste a valuable accessory 
to the enjoyment. And the pourer of the tea — doesn't 
she come in for some share ? ' ' 

" If a young man is very much in love with her he be- 
lieves he is drinking nectar. Then one can use poor 
and cheap teas. The trouble is there are so few young 
men in love with one woman, that, as an economic prob- 
lem, it is not a success." 

"Sherburne," said Uncle Con, "have you a real de- 
light and fervent interest in the study of medicine ? If 
not, it will be tough work." 

" Do you think I have no perseverance? " 

"Perseverance and some knowledge might build a 
house. Still I have hopes of you. You do not write 



"But I have translated from Latin and Greek, and 
used my own ingenuity, talent you might call it," said 
the young man, a little nettled. 

The guests were beginning to disperse. Those who 
had talked the most were declaring they had had a de- 
lightful evening and saying, "Dear Mrs. Townsend." 
Others waited until they were on the sidewalk to an- 
nounce that they liked general topics better, there were 
so many opinionated people among artists. 

"Come, Sherburne," said Uncle Con. 





The young man rose reluctantly. Gertrude had 
drained her urn and declared herself bankrupt. She said 
good-night to some of the guests who thought her worth 
that honor. 

Sherburne leaned a little over her shoulder. "Three 
years," he whispered. " I shall carry away that comfort 
with me." 

A quick rift of color went up her face. She put out 
her hand to Mr. Murray without looking at him, and 
said good-night in a more effusive manner than she had 
meant to. 

Mrs. Townsend still looked fresh and spirited. The 
maid came in to clear away the things. 

" Why didn't you send young Beaumanoir to join the 
discussion?" the elder lady asked. 

" I do not think he cared for it." 

" But he may have some second-hand knowledge 
gleaned from his uncle. Young people amuse me, they 
consider their thoughts new discoveries. Well, perhaps 
we all do. I suppose in working over the century old 
ideas our circumstances and surroundings do give us new 
points of view, and that is where talking does one good 
— if you can dispossess your mind of the belief that our 
elders did not know it quite all. The arguments amused 
me. But I kept one eye on you, Gertrude, and Mr. 
Murray kept one on his nephew. Do not get sentimen- 
tal over the young man." 

"I am not likely to," returned Gertrude, with a short 
laugh. 

"And now let us run off to bed, or else we shall get 
no beauty sleep." 

Gertrude did not get any. She was thinking foolishly 
enough of Sherburne Beaumanoir. Not in any sense of 





special attraction so far as she was concerned. She had 
been amused all along by his sudden fancy. That it 
would die out she felt assured. And yet it had not. 
There had been other young men who enjoyed chatting 
with her. And by this time she had learned that with- 
out special beauty, without either wealth or position she 
could marry very well. But she did enjoy her present 
life and her liberty. 

For a month back Sherburne's attentions had been 
rather pronounced. Ten days before this he had brought 
tickets for her and Mrs. Townsend to see a new star in a 
play that was to be on only for a week. The very next 
morning tickets for the next evening had come from Mr. 
Murray, who would meet them at the theatre later on in 
the evening. 

" I do suppose the young fellow will feel awfully dis- 
appointed, and we have accepted. And Mr. Murray is 
an old friend and a good standby. But we must not 
really encourage the youth in this extravagance, since his 
father has to pay for it. Can we stand both nights ? " 

The play was very well acted. Sherburne was proud
