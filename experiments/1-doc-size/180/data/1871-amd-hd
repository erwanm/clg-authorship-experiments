Ada glanced around with a kind of tacit reproach 
in her face. 

" Yes, I know what you are thinking of, Miss Mer- 
edith, that, without the aid of wealth, this scene 
would lose half its brightness. Much would be taken 
away, I grant, yet I have a fancy that Miss Kathie 
learned the true secret of life and happiness in pov- 



 

erty. I like to watch her now, and I do not know 
two women whom I admire as much as her mother 
and her aunt. But their chief pleasure appears to be 
in distributing, not hoarding." 

Ada looked a little perplexed, as if she did not 
clearly understand. 

' There is that which withholdeth, and yet maketh 
poor," he continued, with a smile. " Many of the 
good things of this world increase with the using. 
All that we give out of our own heart enriches, and 
if we treat it like a miser's treasure, it seems to de- 
crease daily. I think this house ought to be called 
the Palace Bountiful, for every one is taken in and 
treated to the best, not mere odds and ends. And 
that is the charm of the hospitality. Look at Kathie 
now. Who shall say that she is not twice blest in 
giving." 

She did certainly look very radiant, making a 
laughing reply after the song was done. 

" I believe we all like to come here, old and young, 
and we go away satisfied. Yet many people in the 
world offer grander feasts. I think it is the sweet, 
ungrudging cordiality, the desire that every one, no 
matter how humble, shall share the best." 



 

Was that the secret of it, and Kathie's success as 
well ? For every one was attracted toward her. 
Uncle Edward had been won instantly, and there were 
General Mackenzie and queer old Dr. Markham, who 
thought there never could be another Kathie while 
the world stood. These praises had often given Ada 
a jealous pang. Yet no one in their whole circle 
" sought her own ' less than Kathie, and to no one 
was so much freely given. 

" Now we will leave Kathie and come back to 
you," he began again, with an odd smile. " Are you 
going to give up the charms and graces that add so 
much to women's lives ? ' 

" What charms ? " Ada asked, her vanity a little 
wounded. 

" Well, music for one. So many girls let it drop 
with their school-days. The world, or society rather, 
makes so many demands upon them that something 
must get crowded out or thrust aside. And it is sad 
to see those gifts and graces relinquished which would 
render home the happiest for fathers and brothers. 
Be honest, Miss Meredith, and confess that you think 
a prosy chap like me would make an excellent father 
for a great house full of girls." 



 

Ada laughed at the ridiculous idea. A year ago 
she might have considered him prosy, contrasting 
him with Saratoga exquisites ; but he appeared ex- 
ceedingly entertaining now. 

" I have no one to practise with," she said, in
answer. 

" But some one to sing to, I dare say. It is a pity 
to give up the pleasure of so fine a voice." 

" yes, a quadrille, by all means. Uncle Robert 
and Mr. Langdon will dance, I know. There will be 
just enough for two," exclaimed Kathie, in the gayest 
of tones. 

Uncle Robert counted noses. 

" Some one must play, unless we depute that to 
the music-box." 

Mrs. Alston offered herself as a substitute. She 
had helped Hannah take the tea-dishes out to the 
kitchen, and, instead of grumbling, the willing 
domestic had insisted upon doing all the rest. 

Fred Lauriston insisted that he could not dance, 
and Harry Cox made them laugh by declaring that 
he went through the figures with the grace of an 
elephant and the agility of a two-story Shanghai. How- 
ever, Uncle Robert promised to call off, and nearly 
everybody knew the Lancers liy heart. 



 

Mr. Langdon led out Ada, and Uncle Robert took 
Annie Gardiner in charge, who was quite elated. 
They all danced in such earnest that Ada absolutely 
caught the infection. Now and then some one 
blundered and laughed over it, or gave the wrong hand, 
but they were all merry enough. 

Afterward Dick asked Ada to dance with him, and 
then Edmund Gardiner begged the favor. And though 
there was little complimenting, there were a good 
many pleasant and honest things said, which was 
much better. 

So they danced till they were warm and tired. Mr. 
Langdon had a talk with Emma Lauristori, and Ada 
was quite sure he had forgotten all about the song. 
Then the Gardiners thought they must go home, and 
Mary said it was time for them to start, as well. 

" We have had the very loveliest time there could 
possibly be ! We always do have such a good time 
when we come here ! " declared enthusiastic Mary. 

Kathie was very glad. She kissed them a cordial 
good-night down on the lawn path, and when she 
went back Ada was singing for Mr. Langdon, while 
Dick and Fred were a most attentive audience. In- 
deed, they aat up much later than usual. 



 

" I did not suppose it would be half so pleasant," 
Ada said afterward, " for, as a general thing, such 
children are unendurable." 

" There were only two younger than I am," Kathie 
answered, with a smile. 

" O, you know what I mean. Country children do 
not seem to grow up so soon. How nice Fred Lau- 
riston is, and Dick Grayson always was a gentleman. 
But Mr. Langdon is charming. And how lovely you 
did get along with the supper and the serving. I am 
ifraid mamma would have thought my having such a 
jompany an awful bother and nuisance." 

" But we did not go much out of the ordinary 
course, you see, and that made it less trouble. Then 
I helped with the baking this morning, so that 
Hannah should not be all tired out before supper- 
time." 

" You ! " Ada exclaimed, in astonishment. 

" It was my company, you know, and Jane had to 
be away." 

" But I should have thought you would have 
wanted to be fresh for to-night," was the slow reply. 

" And wasn't I fresh ? "
