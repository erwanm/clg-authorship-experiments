"When you have found him and 
acquainted yourself with his scent, 
you will go in the night and placard 
one of these upon the building he 
occupies, and another one upon the 
post-office or in some other prominent 
place. It will be the talk of the region. 
At first you must give him several 
days in which to force a sale of his 
belongings at something approach- 
Careful jjjg their value. We will ruin him 
cruely  
by-and-by, but gradually; we must 
not impoverish him at once, for that 
could bring him to despair and injure 
his health, possibly kill him.''

To Jacob Puller: 
You have days in which 
to settle your affairs. You 
will not he disturbed during 
that limit, which will expire 
at M. , on the of 
You must then MOVE ON. 
If you are still in the place 
after the named hour, I will 
placard you on all the dead 
walls, detailing your crime 
once more, and adding the date, 
also the scene of it, with all 
names concerned, including 
your own. Have no fear of 
bodily injury — it will in no 
circumstances ever be in- 
flicted upon you. You brought 
misery upon an old man, and 
ruined his life and broke his 
heart. What he suffered, you 
are to suffer. 
"You will add no signature. He 
must receive this before he learns of 
the reward - placard — before he rises 
in the morning — lest he lose his head 
and fly the place penniless' 
"I shall not forget." 
"You will need to use these forms 
only in the beginning — once may 
be enough. Afterward, when you are 
ready for him to vanish out of a 
place, see that he gets a copy of this 
form, which merely says : 
MOVE ON. You have days 
"He will obey. That is sure." 
Extracts from Letters to the Mother, 
Denver, April 3, 1897. 
HAVE now been living 
several days in the same 
hotel with Jacob Fuller. 
I have his scent; I could 
track him through ten divisions of in- 
fantry and find him. I have often been 
near him and heard him talk. He owns 
a good mine, and has a fair income 
from it ; but he is not rich. He learned 
mining in a good way — by working 
at it for wages. He is a cheerful 
creature, and his forty -three years 
sit Hghtly upon him; he could pass 
for a younger man — say thirty -six 
or thirty-seven. He has never mar- 
ried again — passes himself off for a 
widower. He stands well, is liked, 
is popular, and has many friends. 
Even I feel a drawing toward him — 
the paternal blood in me making its 
claim. How blind and unreasoning 
and arbitrary are some of the laws 
of nature — the most of them, in fact! 
My task is become hard now — you 
realize it? you comprehend, and make 
allowances? — and the fire of it has 
oled, more than I like to confess to 
myself. But I will carry it out. Even 
with the pleasure paled, the duty re- 
mains, and I will not spare him. 
And for my help, a sharp resent- 
ment rises in me when I reflect that 
he who committed that odious crime 
is the only one who has not suffered 
by it. The lesson of it has mani- 
festly reformed his character, and in 
the change he is happy. He, the 
guilty party, is absolved from all suf- 
fering; you, the innocent, are borne 
down with it. But be comforted — he 
shall harvest his share. 
Silver Gulch, May 19. 
I placarded Form No. i at midnight 
of April 3; an hour later I slipped 
Form No. 2 under his chamber door, 
notifying him to leave Denver at or 
before 11.50 the night of the 14th. 
Some late bird of a reporter stole 
one of my placards, then hunted the 
town over and found the other one, 
and stole that. In this manner he 
accomplished what the profession call 
a " scoop " — that is, he got a valuable 
item, and saw to it that no other pa- 
per got it. And so his paper — the 
principal one in the town — had it in 
glaring type on the editorial page in 
the morning, followed by a Vesuvian 
opinion of our wretch a colunm long, 
which wound up by adding a thou- 
sand dollars to our reward on the 
paper s account! The journals out 
here know how to do the noble thing 
— when there's business in it. 
At breakfast I occupied my usual 
seat — selected because it afforded a 
view of papa Fuller's face, and was 
near enough for me to hear the talk 
that went on at his table. Seventy-  
five or a hundred people were in the  
  or 
room, and all discussing that item,  
and saying they hoped the seeker 
would find that rascal and remove 
the pollution of his presence from 
the town — with a rail, or a bullet, or 
something. 
When Fuller came in he had the 
Notice to Leave — folded up — in one 
hand, and the newspaper in the other ; 
and it gave me more than half a pang 
to see him. His cheerfulness was all 
gone, and he looked old and pinched 
and ashy. And then — only think of 
the things he had to listen to! Mam- 
ma, he heard his own unsuspecting 
friends describe him with epithets 
and characterizations drawn from the 
himself  dictionaries and phrase-books 
of Satan's own authorized editions 
down below. And more than that, 
he had to aee with the verdicts and 
applaud them. His applause tasted 
bitter in his mouth, though; he could 
not disguise that from me; and it was 
observable that his appetite was gone ; 
he only nibbled ; he couldn't eat. Fi- 
nally a man said : 
"It is quite likely that that rela- 
tive is in the room and hearing what 
this town thinks of that imspeak- 
able scoundrel. I hope so." 
Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way 
Fuller winced, and glanced around 
scared! He couldn't endure any 
more, and got up and left.
