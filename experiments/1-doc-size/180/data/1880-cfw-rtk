gotten : she improvised a sort of dance around my room, fol 
lowed by Drollo dragging his twisted chain, stepping on it 
with his big feet, and finally winding himself up into a knot 
around the chair-legs. 

" Couldn't we make Drollo something too ? dear old Drol 
lo ! " said Felipa, going to him and squeezing him in an en 
thusiastic embrace. I used to wonder how his poor ribs 
stood it : Felipa used him as a safety-valve for her impetuous 
feelings. 

She kissed me good night, and then asked for " the other 
lady." 

" Go to bed, child," I said ; " I will give her your good 
night." 

" But I want to kiss her too," said Felipa. 

She lingered at the door and would not go ; she played 
with the latch, and made me nervous with its clicking ; at last 
I ordered her out. But on opening my door half an hour 
afterward there she was sitting on the floor outside in the 
darkness, she and Drollo, patiently waiting. Annoyed, but 
unable to reprove her, I wrapped the child in my shawl 
and carried her out into the moonlight, where Christine 
and Edward were strolling to and fro under the pines. 
" She will not go to bed, Christine, without kissing you," I 
explained. 



 

" Funny little monkey !" said my friend, passively allow 
ing the embrace. 

" Me too," said Edward, bending down. Then I carried 
my bundle back satisfied. 

The next day Felipa and I in secret began our labors ; 
hers consisted in worrying me out of my life and spoiling 
material mine in keeping my temper and trying to sew. 
The result, however, was satisfactory, never mind how we 
got there. I led Christine out one afternoon : Edward fol 
lowed. " Do you like tableaux ?" I said. " There is one I 
have arranged for you." 

Felipa sat on the edge of the low, square-curbed Spanish 
well, and Drollo stood behind her, his great yellow body and 
solemn head serving as a background. She wore a brown 
petticoat barred with bright colors, and a little scarlet bodice 
fitting her slender waist closely ; a chemisette of soft cream- 
color with loose sleeves covered her neck and arms, and set 
off the dark hues of her cheeks and eyes ; and around her 
curly hair a red scarf was twisted, its fringed edges forming 
a drapery at the back of the head, which, more than anything 
else, seemed to bring out the latent character of her face. 
Brown moccasins, red stockings, and a quantity of bright 
beads completed her costume. 

" By Jove ! " cried Edward, " the little thing is almost 
pretty." 

Felipa understood this, and a great light came into her 
face : forgetting her pose, she bounded forward to Christine's 
side. " I am pretty, then ? " she said with exultation ; " I 
am pretty, then, after all ? For now you yourself have said 
it have said it." 

" No, Felipa," I interposed, " the gentleman said it." For 
the child had a curious habit of confounding the two iden 
tities which puzzled me then as now. But this afternoon, 
this happy afternoon, she was content, for she was allowed to 
sit at Christine's feet and look up into her fair face unmolest 
ed. I was forgotten, as usual. 




" It is always so," I said to myself. But cynicism, as Mr. 
Aldrich says, is a small brass field-piece that eventually bursts 
arid kills the artilleryman. I knew this, having been blown 
up myself more than once ; so I went back to my painting 
and forgot the world. Our world down there on the edge of 
the salt-marsh, however, was a small one : when two persons 
went out of it there was a vacuum. 

One morning Felipa came sadly to my side. " They have 
gone away," she said. 

" Yes, child." 

" Down to the beach to spend all the day." 

" Yes, I know it." 

" And without me ! " 

This was the climax. I looked up. Her eyes were dry, 
but there was a hollow look of disappointment in her face 
that made her seem old ; it was as though for an instant you 
caught what her old-woman face would be half a century on. 

" Why did they not take me ? " she said. " I am pretty 
now : she herself said it." 

" They can not always take you, Felipa," I replied, giving 
up the point as to who had said it. 

" Why not ? I am pretty now : she herself said it," per 
sisted the child. " In these clothes, you know : she herself 
said it. The clothes of the son of Pedro you will never see 
more : they are burned." 

" Burned ? " 

" Yes, burned," replied Felipa composedly. " I carried 
them out on the barren and burned them. Drollo singed his 
paw. They burned quite nicely. But they are gone, and I 
am pretty now, and yet they did not take me ! What shall I 
do?" 

" Take these colors and make me a picture," I suggested. 
Generally, this was a prized privilege, but to-day it did not 
attract ; she turned away, and a few moments after I saw her 
going down to the end of the plank-walk, where she stood 
gazing wistfully toward the ocean. There she staid all day, 



going into camp with Drollo, and refusing to come to dinner 
in spite of old Dominga's calls and beckonings. At last the 
patient old grandmother went down herself to the end of the 
long walk where they were, with some bread and venison on 
a plate. Felipa ate but little, but Drollo, after waiting politely 
until she had finished, devoured everything that was left in 
his calmly hungry way, and then sat back on his haunches 
with one paw on the plate, as though for the sake of memory. 
Drollo's hunger was of the chronic kind ; it seemed impos 
sible either to assuage it or to fill him. There was a gaunt 
leanness about him which I am satisfied no amount of food 
could ever fatten. I think he knew it too, and that accounted 
for his resignation. At length, just before sunset, the boat 
returned, floating up the marsh with the tide, old Bartolo 
steering and managing the brown sails. Felipa sprang up 
joyfully ; I thought she would spring into the boat in her 
eagerness. What did she receive for her long vigil ? A short 
word or two ; that was all. Christine and Edward had quar 
reled. 

How do lovers quarrel ordinarily ? But I should not ask 
that, for these were no ordinary lovers : they were extraor 
dinary. 

" You should not submit to her caprices so readily," I said 
the next day while strolling on the barren with Edward. (He 
was not so much cast down, however, as he might have 
been.) 

" I adore the very ground her foot touches, Kitty." 

" I know it. But how will it end ? " 

" I will tell you : some of these days I shall win her, and 
then she will adore me." 

Here Felipa came running after us, and Edward immedi 
ately challenged her to a race: a game of romps began. If 
Christine had been looking from her window she might have 
thought he was not especially disconsolate over her absence ; 
but she was not looking. She was never looking out of any 
thing or for anybody. She was always serenely content where 



she was. Edward and Felipa strayed off among the pine- 
trees, and gradually I lost sight of them. But as I sat sketch 
ing an hour afterward Edward came into view, carrying the 
child in his arms. I hurried to meet them.
