corners by yourself and mope and be disagreeable. But you do not, you
see. You are always 'on hand' as they call it, always ready to make
things pleasant for everybody."
"That is because I am so good-natured."
"What is good nature?"
"A combination of laziness and vulgarity," Vanbrugh answered promptly.
"Oh!"
"Yes," said Vanbrugh. "The vulgarity that wishes to please everybody,
and the laziness that cannot say no."
"You are not a lawyer for nothing. But you are not lazy and you are not
vulgar. If you were I should not like you."
"Do you like me?" asked Vanbrugh quickly.
"Very much," she answered with a little laugh.
"You just made me define good nature, Miss Maylands. How do you define
liking?"
"Oh, it is very vague," said Dolly in an airy tone. "It is a sort of
uncly, auntly thing."
"Oh. I see."
"Do you?"
"Uncles and aunts sometimes marry, do they not?"
"What an idea? They are always brothers and sisters."
"Unless they are uncles and aunts of different people," suggested
Vanbrugh.
At this point they were interrupted by the entrance of Stubbs. That
dignified functionary had suffered intensely during the last few days,
but his tortures were not yet over. So far as lay in his power he still
maintained that absolute correctness of appearance which distinguished
him from the common, or hirsute "head man"; but he could not control
the colour of his face nor the expression of his eyes. He had been a
footman in the house of Marion's father, in that very house in fact,
and had completely identified himself with the family. Had he
considered that he was in the employment of Simon and John Darche, he
would have long since given notice and sought a place better suited to
his eminent respectability. But having always waited upon Marion since
she had been a little girl, he felt bound by all the tenets of
inherited butlerdom--and by a sort of devotion not by any means to be
laughed at--to stand by his young mistress through all her troubles. By
this time his eyes had a permanently unsettled look in them as though
he never knew what fearful sight he might next gaze upon, and the ruddy
colour was slowly but certainly sinking to the collar line. It had
already descended to the lower tips of his ears.
"Beg pardon, Miss Maylands," he said in a subdued tone, "beg pardon,
sir. Mr. John has come with those gentlemen."
Both Dolly and Vanbrugh started slightly and looked up at him. Vanbrugh
was the first to speak.
"Do you not think you had better go away--to Mrs. Darche?" he asked.
"She may want to see you for a minute."
Dolly rose and left the room.
"I suppose they will come in here," said Vanbrugh, addressing Stubbs.
"Yes, sir," answered the butler nervously, "they are coming."
"Well--let us make the best of it."
A moment later John Darche entered the room, followed closely by three
men, evidently dressed for the occasion, according to superior orders,
in what, at police head-quarters, was believed to be the height of the
fashion, for they all wore light snuff-coloured overcoats, white ties,
dark trousers and heavily-varnished shoes, and each had a perfectly
new high hat in his hand. They looked about the room with evident
curiosity.
Darche himself was deathly pale and had grown thinner. Otherwise he was
little changed. As soon as he caught sight of Vanbrugh, he came
forward, extending his hand.
"I have not had a chance to thank you for your able defence," he said
calmly.
"It is not necessary," answered Vanbrugh coldly, and putting his hands
behind him as he leaned against the mantelpiece. "It was a matter of
duty."
"Very well," said John Darche stiffly, and drawing back a step. "If you
do not want to shake hands we will treat it as a matter of business."
"He is pretty fresh, ain't he?" remarked one of the officers in an
undertone to his neighbour.
"You bet he is," answered the other.
"Now I have got to see the old gentleman," said Darche, speaking to
Vanbrugh. "Before I go, I would like to have a word with you. There is
no objection to my speaking privately to Mr. Vanbrugh, I suppose?" he
inquired, turning to the officer.
"Not if you stay in the room," answered the one who took the lead.
Darche nodded to Vanbrugh, who somewhat reluctantly followed him to the
other end of the room.
"I say," he began in a tone not to be overheard by the detectives. "Can
you not give me another chance?"
"What sort of chance?" replied Vanbrugh, raising his eyebrows.
"If I could get through that door," said John looking over Vanbrugh's
shoulder, "I could get away. I know the house and they do not.
Presently, when my father comes, if you could create some sort of
confusion for a moment, I could slip out. They will never catch me.
There is an Italian sailing vessel just clearing. I have had exact
information. If I can get through that door I can be in the Sixth
Avenue Elevated in three minutes and out of New York Harbour in an
hour."
Vanbrugh had no intention of being a party to the escape. He met
Darche's eyes coldly as he answered.
"No, I will not do it. I have defended you in open court, but I am not
going to help you evade the law."
"Do not be too hard, Vanbrugh," said Darche, in a tone of entreaty.
"Things are not half so bad as they are made out."
"If that is true, I am sorry. But you have had a perfectly fair trial."
"Will you not help me get away?" Darche urged knowing that this was his
last chance.
"No."
"Vanbrugh," said John in an insinuating tone, "you used to be fond of
my wife. You wanted to marry her."
"What has that to do with it?" asked Vanbrugh turning sharply upon him.
"You may marry her and welcome, if you let me get through that door. I
shall never be heard of again."
"You infernal scoundrel!" Vanbrugh was thoroughly disgusted. "Now
gentlemen," he said, turning to the officer in charge, "I will bring
Mr. Darche here to see his son. I am sure that for the old gentleman's
sake, out of mere humanity, you will do the best you can to keep up
the illusion we have arranged. He is old and his mind wanders. He will
scarcely notice your presence."
"Yes, sir," the man answered. "You may trust us to do that, sir. Now
then, boys," he said, addressing his two companions, "straighten up,
best company manners, stiff upper lip--keep your eye on the young man.
He is rather too near that door for my taste."
John Darche's face expressed humiliation and something almost
approaching to despair. He was about to make another attempt, and had
moved a step towards Vanbrugh, when he suddenly started a little and
stood still. Marion stood in the open door beyond three detectives. She
touched one of them on the shoulder as a sign that she wished to pass.
"Pardon me, lady," said the man, drawing back. "Anything that we can do
for you?"
"I am Mrs. Darche. I wish to speak to my husband."
"Certainly, madam," and all three made way for her.
She went straight to her husband, and stood before him at the other end
of the room, speaking in a low voice.
"Is there anything I can do for you, John?" she asked so that he could
barely hear her.
"You can help me to get away--if you will." John Darche's eyes fell
before hers.
She gazed at him during several seconds, hesitating, perhaps, between
her sense of justice and her desire to be faithful to her husband to
the very end.
"Yes, I will," she said briefly.
Before she spoke again she turned quite naturally, as though in
hesitation, and satisfied herself that the three men were out of
hearing. Vanbrugh, perhaps suspecting what was taking place, had
engaged them in conversation near the door.
"How?" she asked, looking at John again. "Tell me quickly."
"Presently, when my father comes, get as many people as you can. Let me
be alone for a moment. Make some confusion, upset something, anything
will do. Give me a chance to get through the door into the library."
"I will try. Is that all?"
"Thank you," said John Darche, and for one moment a look of something
like genuine gratitude passed over his hard face. "Yes, that is all.
You will be glad to get rid of me."
Marion looked one moment longer, hesitated, said nothing and turned
away.
"If you have no objections," said Vanbrugh addressing the officer in
charge, "we will take Mr. Darche to his father's room instead of asking
him to come here."
"Yes, sir," answered the detective. "We can do that."
As they were about to leave the room, Brett met them at the door. He
paused a moment and looked about. Then he went straight to Vanbrugh.
"Has he seen him yet?" he asked.
"No, we are just going," answered Vanbrugh.
"Can I be of any use?"
"Stay with Mrs. Darche."
"Shall we go?" he asked, turning to John.
"How brave you are!" exclaimed Brett when they were alone.
"Does it need much courage?" asked Marion, sinking into a chair. "I do
not know. Perhaps."
"I know that there are not many men who could bear all this as well as
you do," Brett answered, and there was a little emotion in his face.
"Men are different. Mr. Brett--" she began after a short pause.
"Yes, do you want to ask me something?"
"Yes, something that is very hard to ask. Something that you will
refuse."
"That would be hard indeed."
"Will you promise not to be angry?" asked Marion faintly.
"Of course I will," Brett answered.
"Do not be so sure. Men's honour is such a strange thing. You may think
what I am going to ask touches it."
"What is it?"
He sat down beside her and prepared to listen.
"Will you help my husband to escape?" asked Marion in a whisper.
"No--do not say it. Wait until I tell you first how it can be done.
Presently I will get them all into this room. Old Mr. Darche is too
ill to come, I am afraid. You have not spoken alone to John yet. Take
him aside and bring him close to this door on pretence of exchanging a
few words. I will make a diversion of some sort at the other end of the
