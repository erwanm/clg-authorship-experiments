Time will not serve us to follow old 
Stubbes into his particular inquisition of 
every article of woman's attire, and his 
hearty damnation of them all and several. 





 

He cannot even abide their carrying of 
nosegays and posies of flowers to smell 
at, since the palpable odors and fumesof 
these do enter the brain to degenerate 
the spirit and allure to vice. They must 
needs carry looking-glasses with them; 
" and good reason," says Stubbes, sav- 
agely, " for else how could they see the 
devil in them ? for no doubt they are the 
devil's spectacles [these women] to al- 
lure us to pride and consequently to de- 
struction forever." And, as if it were 
not enough to be women, and the devil's 
aids, they do also have doublets and 
jerkins, buttoned up the breast, and made 
with wings, welts, and pinions on the 
shoulder points, as man's apparel is, for 
all the world. We take reluctant leave 
of this entertaining woman-hater, and 
only stay to quote from him a " fearful 
Judgment of God, shewed upon a gen- 
tlewoman of Antwerp of late, even the 




 

27th of May, 1582," which may be as 
profitable to read now as it was then : 
" This gentlewoman being a very rich 
Merchant man's daughter: upon a time 
was invited to a bridal, or wedding, which 
was solemnized in that Toune, against 
which day she made great preparation, 
for the pluming herself in gorgeous ar- 
ray, that as her body was most beauti- 
ful, fair, and proper, so her attire in ev- 
ery respect might be correspondent to 
the same. For the accomplishment 
whereof she curled her hair, she dyed 
her locks, and laid them out after the 
best manner, she colored her face with 
waters and Ointments : But in no case 
could she get any (so curious and dainty 
she was) that could starch, and set her 
Ruffs and Neckerchers to her mind : 
wherefore she sent for a couple of Laun- 
dresses, who did the best they could to 
please her humors, but in any wise they 
could not. Then fell she to swear and 
tear, to curse and damn, casting the Ruffs 
under feet, and wishing that the Devil 
might take her when she wear any of 
those Neckerchers again. In the mean- 
time (through the sufference of God) 
the Devil transforming himself into the 
form of a young man, as brave and 
proper as she in every point of outward 
appearance, came in, feigning himself 
to be a wooer or suitor unto her. And 
seeing her thus agonized, and in such a 
pelting chase, he demanded of her the 
cause thereof, who straightway told him 
(as women can conceal nothing that lieth 
upon their stomachs) howshe was abused 
in the setting of her Ruffs, which thing 
being heard of him, he promised to 
please her mind, and thereto took in 
hand the setting of her Ruffs, which he 
performed to her great contentation and 
liking, in so much as she looking herself 




 

in a glass (as the Devil bade her) became 
greatly enamoured of him. This done, 
the young man kissed her, in the doing 
whereof she writhe her neck in sunder, 
so she died miserably, her body being 
metamorphosed into black and blue col- 
ors, most ugglesome to behold, and her 
face (which before was so amorous) be- 
came most deformed, and fearful to look 
upon. This being known, preparaunce 
was made for her burial, a rich coffin 
was provided, and her fearful body was 
laid therein, and it covered very sumpt- 
uously. Four men immediately assay- 
ed to lift up the corpse, but could not 
move it ; then six attempted the like, but 
could not once stir it from the place 
where it stood. Whereat the standers- 
by marveling, caused the coffin to be 
opened to see the cause thereof. Where 
they found the body to be taken away, 
and a black Cat very lean and deformed 





 

sitting in the coffin, setting of great 
Ruffs, and frizzling of hair, to the great 
fear and wonder of all beholders." 

Better than this pride which fore- 
runneth destruction, in the opinion of 
Stubbes, is the habit of the Brazilian 
women, who " esteem so little of appar- 
el" that they rather choose to go naked 
than be thought to be proud. 

As I read the times of Elizabeth, there 
was then greater prosperity and enjoy- 
ment of life among the common people 
than fifty or a hundred years later. Into 
the question of the prices of labor and 
of food, which Mr. Froude considers so 
fully in the first chapter of his history, 
I shall not enter any further than to re- 
mark that the hardness of the laborer's 
lot, who got, mayhap, only twopence a 
day, is mitigated by the fact that for a 
penny he could buy a pound of meat 
which now costs a shilling. In two re- 




 

spects England has greatly changed for 
the traveller, from the sixteenth to the 
eighteenth century — in its inns and its 
roads. 

In the beginning of Elizabeth's reign 
travellers had no choice but to ride on 
horseback or to walk. Goods were trans- 
ported on strings of pack-horses. When 
Elizabeth rode into the city from her 
residence at Greenwich, she placed her- 
self behind her lord chancellor, on a 
pillion. The first improvement made 
was in the construction of a rude wagon — 
a cart without springs, the body resting 
solidly on the axles. In such a vehicle 
Elizabeth rode to the opening of her 
fifth Parliament. In 1583, on a certain 
day, Sir Harry Sydney entered Shrews- 
bury in his wagon, " with his trompeter 
blowynge, verey joyfull to behold and 
see." Even such conveyances fared hard 
on the execrable roads of the period. 





 

Down to the end of the seventeenth 
century most of the country roads were
