stump, or any unclean thing is permitted to remain in the walks, for
the veterans capture it as an invader, and put it out of sight. The
front of the palace is seven hundred and eighty feet long. Peter
the Great erected a building here, but the present edifice was built
during the reign of Elizabeth, and was embellished by Catharine II.
Originally, every statue, pedestal, capital of a column, and all
the ornaments, were gilded, the gold for which was worth over two
millions of dollars. In a short time the gilding was badly injured
by the weather. The contractors employed in repairing the building
offered Catharine half a million silver rubles for the gold leaf which
remained on the ornaments, to whom she replied, "I am not accustomed to
sell my old clothes." The front of the palace is now gaudily painted
with white, green, and yellow, the only gilding being on the dome
and cupolas of the church. Parts of the interior, however, are very
lavishly gilded, as the chapel, the ceiling of which is one sheet of
gold. One small apartment has strips of lapis lazuli inlaid upon the
walls, and the floor is of ebony, ornamented with mother-of-pearl.
In another room the walls are panelled with amber, wrought into a
variety of designs. The amber was presented to Catharine by Frederick
the Great, and their initials and arms are blended in the panels;
that of the Czarina being an E, for her Russian name was Ekaterina.
There seems to be enough of this costly material to make mouth-pieces
for all the pipes in Christendom. Catharine's sleeping apartment has
pillars of purple glass, and the walls are decorated with porcelain.
The bed-clothes are those under which she slept the last time she
dwelt in the palace. The banqueting-rooms and the ball-rooms are
profusely gilded, and, as may be seen in several of the palaces of
Europe, especially those of Poland, Russia, and Sweden, there is a
Chinese room, in which everything is fitted up in "Celestial" style.
The rooms of Alexander I. are kept just as he left them when he started
for Taganrog, where he died. In his cabinet is his writing-desk, all
in confusion, with blotted paper, and quill pens, stained with ink, as
though he had but just used them. Next to this is his bed-room, which
is plain enough for an ordinary farmer. In an alcove is a camp bedstead
on which the Czar slept. His toilet articles are on the table, and on a
chair is his well-worn overcoat under which are his boots.

The party walked through the Alexander Palace built by Catharine for
her grandson, and occupied by Nicholas, whose military tastes are
apparent in the pictures, models, and other ornaments. From this
they went to the Arsenal, in which there is a vast collection of
ancient armor, arms, and Oriental trappings. In a glass case are a
miniature drum and trumpet of silver, given by Catharine to Paul in
his childhood. The grounds were very attractive to the students, for
they are filled with towers, kiosks, Chinese pagodas and other odd
structures. The mast of a frigate, full rigged, afforded the present
High Admiral, the Grand Duke Constantine, the means of obtaining some
experience aloft without going to sea. On one of the ponds there is a
fleet of miniature vessels, which was used for the amusement of the
same young gentleman. A Chinese village, an aerial flower garden,
supported on an Ionic pillar, a marble bridge, columns erected by
Catharine to her favorites, hermitages, ruins, Roman tombs, grottoes,
and waterfalls add to the wonders of the place. On a small lake is a
pavilion, in which the daughter of Nicholas, who died in 1844, used
to feed her swims. Since her death, black swans have been kept in the
pond. In the pavilion are a picture and a marble statue of the youthful
Grand Duchess.

"I think I could pass a summer here very comfortably," said Lincoln,
as he gazed with admiration upon the beautiful grounds and the many
curious structures it contains.

"Perhaps you would alter your mind before the season closed," replied
the doctor. "I was in Russia one year in August, and I think I wore
an overcoat every day for a fortnight, not at night merely, but in
the middle of the day. Still the weather is sometimes very warm here.
On the whole, I think I should prefer to be here in the winter. St.
Petersburg is very lively then, the court is in town, and there is a
variety of amusements."

"I should like to see the fun for a while, and the strange sights which
are to be seen only in winter, such as the sleigh-riding, skating, and
frolics on the ice," added Lincoln.

"I think the want of ventilation in the houses must be one of the
greatest evils of a residence here," continued Dr. Winstock, as the
party left the palace gardens.

The company returned to St. Petersburg, and spent the rest of the day
in visiting palaces and other places of interest. At the usual hour
they embarked on the steamer, and returned to the squadron.




CHAPTER XII.

THE JOURNEY TO MOSCOW.


"I think it is absolutely villanous to let that little pauper go down
the Volga, when there are so many of us who pay our bills, that wish
to go," said De Forrest, angrily, when it was rumored that the first
division of the students, with the Volga party would start that day for
Moscow.

"Well, he was fairly elected, I suppose," replied Beckwith.

"Elected!" sneered De Forrest. "Scott elected him. When he takes snuff,
all the fellows in the steerage sneeze."

"I thought you were going to get up a petition to the principal to have
the old method of giving out the offices restored, and have this voting
business done with."

"I talked with some of the fellows about it, but most of them said they
wouldn't sign."

"Why not?"

"Some of them said they rather liked the fun and excitement of the
election; others said they had gone in for the thing, and didn't like
to take the back track. I shouldn't wonder if they had joined the
Bangwhangers. Between you and me, Beckwith, I am getting a little
tired of the ship."

"Tired of it? I thought you considered it the biggest thing in the
world."

"Well, I did; but it is about played out. I worked hard to be captain,
but never got higher than third lieutenant; now I'm only a purser."

"You didn't work very hard last month," suggested Beckwith.

"I didn't think it was any use when I saw such fellows as Cantwell,
Sheridan, and Murray getting in ahead of me, in spite of all I could
do. No matter for that; Russia is a big country."

"That's so."

"A fellow could easily get lost in it, for none of us speak a word of
Russian, and most of us not much French or German," added De Forrest,
dropping his voice down to a whisper.

Beckwith looked at him, and tried to comprehend his meaning.

"Those fellows that ran away in Sweden, pretending they couldn't find
the ship, got off easy," added the purser.

"Not one of them has been punished, except Stockwell, who was only
deprived of his position as coxswain of the second cutter," replied
Beckwith, beginning to understand his friend. "All of them have been
allowed to go on shore with the rest."

"I should like to take just such an excursion on the same terms,"
continued De Forrest.

"But those fellows owned up, made a clean breast of it, and promised to
be good boys. The penalty hung over them for a week, and only their
good behavior saved them."

"Do you want to go down the Volga, Beck?"

"Of course I do. I would buy out any fellow's chance if I could."

"Perhaps we may go yet," replied De Forrest, with a wink.

"How?"

"Never mind it now. We are both in the first division, and shall go
to Moscow with the others. We will talk about it when we get there.
I expect to drop into the steerage next month, and I had as lief be
hanged for an old sheep as a lamb. Don't say anything."

"Of course not; but you don't mean to run away--do you?"

"Dry up!"

"Nobody is near us."

"I never was so disgusted with anything in my life as I am with this
election business. If I say anything, the fellows tell me it is a
chicken of my own hatching. Now, Cantwell pretends to be one of the
chaplain's lambs, affects a gentlemanly bearing, and studies seamanship
when all of us are on shore. Then he gave that Billy Bobstay a hundred
rubles, and the fellows all cheered him for it. I am so mad, I can
hardly hold in. I would rather be in a slave ship than here. I'm nobody
now."

De Forrest's schemes for his personal advancement had been utterly
