begging, as we sat upon the walls of the terrace, — the 
terrace which overhangs the busy plain below, and which 
commands the entire, varied, nooky promontory, and the 
two bays. And these children, insensible to beauty, want 
centesimi ! 

In the rear of the church are some splendid specimens 
of the umbrella-like Italian pine. Here we found, also, 
a pretty little ruin, — it might be Greek and it might be 
Druid for any thing that appeared, — ivy-clad, and sug- 
gesting a religion older than that of the convent. To 
the east we look into a fertile, terraced ravine ; and 
beyond to a precipitous brown mountain, which shows 
a sharp outline against the sky ; half-way up are nests 
of towns, white houses, churches, and above, creeping 
along the slope, the thread of an ancient road, with 
stone arches at intervals, as old as Cassar. 

We descend, skirting for some distance the monastery 
walls, over which patches of ivy hang like green shawls. 
There are flowers in profusion, — scented violets, daisies, 
dandelions, and crocuses, large and of the richest vari- 
ety, with orange pistils, and stamens purple and violet, - 
the back of every alternate leaf exquisitely pencilled. 

We descend into a continuous settlement, past shrines, 
past brown, sturdy men and handsome girls working in 
the vineyards ; we descend — but words express noth- 
ing — into a wonderful ravine, a sort of refined Swiss 
scene, — high, bare steps of rock butting over a chasm, 
ruins, old walls, vines, flowers. The very spirit of peace 
is here, and it is not disturbed by the sweet sound of 
bells echoed in the passes. On narrow ledges of pre- 
cipices, aloft in the air where it would seem that a bird 
could scarcely light, we distinguish the forms of men 
and women ; and their voices come down to us. They 
are peasants cutting grass, every spire of which is too 
precious to waste. 

We descend, and pass by a house on a knoll, and a 
terrace of olives extending along the road in front. Half 
a dozen children come to the road to look at us as we 



  

approach, and then scamper back to the house in fear," 
tumbling over each other and shouting, the eldest girl 
making good her escape with the baby. My companion 
swings his hat, and cries, " Hullo, baby ! " And when we 
have passed the gate, and are under the wall, the whole 
ragged, brown-skinned troop scurry out upon the terrace, 
and run along, calling after us, in perfect English, as 
long as we keep in sight, " Hullo, baby ! " " Hullo, baby ! " 
The next traveller who goes that way will no doubt be 
hailed by the quick-witted natives with this salutation ; 
and, if he is of a philological turn, he will probably ben- 
efit his mind by running the phrase back to its ultimate 
Greek roots. 



 

FOR three years, once upon a time, it did not rain in- 
Sorrento. Not a drop out of the clouds for three 
years, an Italian lady here, born in Ireland, assures me. 
If there was an occasional shower on the Piano during 
all that drought, I have the confidence in her to think 
that she would not spoil the story by noticing it. 

The conformation of the hills encircling the plain 
would be likely to lead any shower astray, and discharge 
it into the sea, with whatever good intentions it may 
have started down the promontory for Sorrento. I can 
see how these sharp hills would tear the clouds asunder, 
and let out all their water, while the people in the plain 
below watched them with longing eyes. But it can rain 
in Sorrento. Occasionally the north-east wind comes 
down with whirling, howling fury, as if it would scoop 
villao;es and orchards out of the little nook ; and the 
rain, riding on the v/hirlwind, pours in drenching floods. 
At such times I hear the beat of the waves at the foot 
of the rock, and feel like a prisoner on an island. Eden 
would not be Eden in a rain-storm. 

The drought occurred just after the expulsion of the 
Bourbons from Naples, and many think on account of it. 
There is this to be said in favor of the Bourbons : that a 
dry time never had occurred while they reigned, — a 
statement in which all good Catholics in Sorrento will 
concur. As the drought went on, almost all the wells in 
the place dried up, except that of the Tramontane and 
 



  

the one in the suppressed convent of the Sacred Heart, — 
I think that is its name. 

It is a rambling pile of old buildings, in the centre of 
the town, with a court-yard in the middle, and in it a 
deep well, boring down I know not how far into the rock, 
and always full of cold, sweet water. The nuns have all 
gone now ; and I look in vain up at the narrow slits in 
the masonry, which served them for windows, for the 
glance of a worldly or a pious eye. The poor people of 
Sorrento, when the public wells and fountains had gone 
dry, used to come and draw at the Tramontano ; but they 
were not allowed to go to the well of the convent, — the 
gates were closed. Why the Government shut them I 
cannot see : perhaps it knew nothing of it, and some 
stupid official took the pompous responsibility. The peo- 
ple grumbled, and cursed the Government ; and, in their 
simplicity, probably never took any steps to revoke the 
prohibitory law. No doubt, as the Government had 
caused the drought, it was all of a piece, the good rustics 
thought. 

For the Government did indirectly occasion the dry 
spell. I have the information from the Italian lady of 
whom I have spoken. Among the first steps of the new 
Government of Italy was the suppression of the useless 
convents and nunneries. This one at Sorrento early 
came under the ban. It always seemed to me almost 
a pity to rout out this asylum of praying and charitable 
women, whose occupation was the encouragement of 
beggary and idleness in others, but whose prayers were 
constant, and whose charities to the sick of the little 
city were many. If they never were of much good to 
the community, it was a pleasure to have such a sweet 
little hive in the centre of it ; and I doubt not that the 
simple people felt a genuine satisfaction, as they walked 
around the high walls, in believing that pure prayers 
within were put up for them night and day ; and espe- 
cially when they waked at night, and heard the bell of 
the convent, and knew that at that moment some faith- 



  

ful soul kept her vigils, and chanted prayers for them 
and all the world besides ; and they slept the sounder for 
it thereafter. I confess, that, if one is helped by vicari- 
ous prayer, I would rather trust a convent of devoted 
women (though many of them are ignorant, and some 
of them are worldly, and none are fair to see) to pray 
for me, than some of the houses of coarse monks which I 
have seen. 

But the order came down from Naples to pack off all 
the nuns of the Sacred Heart on a day named, to close 
up the gates of the nunnery, and hang a flaming sword 
outside. The nuns were to be pulled up by the roots, so 
to say, on the day specified, and without postponement, 
and to be transferred to a house prepared for them at 
Massa, a few miles down the promontory, and several 
hundred feet nearer heaven. Sorrento was really in 
momming : it went about in grief. It seemed as if some- 
thing sacrilegious were about to be done. It was the 
intention of the whole town to show its sense of it in 
some way. 

The day of removal came, and it rained ! It poured : 
the water came down in sheets, in torrents, in deluges ; 
it came down with the wildest tempest of many a year. 
I think, from accurate reports of those who witnessed it, 
that the beginning of the. great Deluge was only a moist- 
ure compared to this. To turn the poor women out of 
doors such a day as this, was unchristian, barbarous, 
impossible. Everybody who had a shelter was shivering 
in-doors. But the officials were inexorable. In the 
order for removal, nothing was said about postponement 
on account of- weather ; and go the nuns must. 

And go they did ; the whole town shuddering at the
