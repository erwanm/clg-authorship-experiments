 

his room. He sat in the big rocker, in the dark, 
without moving, till ten. No sound had come 
from the doctor 's side of the house. Acting upon 
a sudden impulse, of which he was half ashamed, 
half defensive, and which he owned himself wholly 
disinclined to resist, he groped for his crutches and 
got out upon the piazza, where he could see the 
light from her windows making a great radiance 
upon the acacia-tree, and showing the outlines of 
the short, wet grass. A honeysuckle clambered 
over the nearest window. When the curtain drifted 
in the warm wind, the long-necked flowers seemed 
to look in. The subdued sound of voices came to 
his ear. He went back, and got upon the lounge. 
As he lay there, the lumbermen returned, singing.



" Thus with the man, thus with the tree, 
Sharp at the root the axe must be." 

Mrs. Butterwell came in to say good-night. She 
held a candle, which made fickle revelations of her 
black silk dress and sallow cheeks. She expressed 
surprise at finding her lodger in the dark, and 
lighted his Japanese lantern assiduously. She 
thought Mr. Yorke had been calling on the doctor. 

" She sent me to bed," said Yorke. " She has 
another fellow there." 

"They will come at all hours," replied Mrs. 
Butterwell, serenely. " More blame to em ! " 



 

" Who will come at all hours? " gasped Yorke. 

"Why, patients, of course. Who else? " 

" This isn't  a patient. This is a gentleman." 

" I want to know ! " said Mrs. Butterwell, put 
ting down the light. 

"And so do I," said Yorke, grimly. 

" A tall, dark-complected gentleman ? Wears 
a crush felt hat and gray gloves, a beautiful 
fit?" 

" I didn't  notice his gloves, savagely. 

" A handsome man, wasn't  he ? " pursued Mrs. 
Butterwell, cruelly. "Splendid figure and great 
blue eyes " 

" How should I know about his eyes ? " groaned 
Yorke. 

" Oh, it must be he," returned Mrs. Butterwell, 
placidly. " I wonder I didn't  see him in the stage. 
I always mean to look in the stage. May be he 
drove, he 's apt to." 

Yorke made no answer. Every word of Mrs. 
Butterwell 's caused an acute pain in his left tem 
ple, like the nail in the brain of Sisera ; he put up 
his hand to his head. 

" His name is Penhallow," hammered Mrs. But 
terwell, " Doctor Penhallow, of Bangor. He is 
a famous surgeon, very famous. He sets the 
world by her." 



 

" It can't be it isn't  the fellow she telegraphed 
to about my case, at the beginning ? " cried Yorke. 

" Oh, I dare say. Doctor didn't  mention it to 
me. Doctor never talks about her cases. She ad 
mires Doctor Penhallow above all. He was her 
preceptor. He 's old enough to be well, it 
would be a young sort of father ; but he 's well 
along ; he couldn't  be so famous if he wasn't  ; 
nor she wouldn't  feel that kind of feeling for 
him, that looking up. He 's the only man I 
ever saw Doctor look up to. She ain't like the 
rest of us ; we wear our upper lids short with it. 
I declare ! It seems to me in course of genera 
tions women wouldn't  have had any eyelids ; 
they 'd be what you call nowadays selected away, 
by worshipin men-folks, if Providence hadn't  
thrown in such lots of little men, mites and dots 
of souls, too short for the biggest fool alive to call 
the tallest. Then, half the time, she gets on her 
knees to him to make out the difference. Oh, I 've 
seen em ! Down on their knees, and stay there 
to make him think he 's as big as he wants to be, 
and pacify him. Then another thing," added Mrs. 
Butterwell, gently, "is babies. You 've got to 
look down to your babies, and that keeps the bal 
ance something like even. Providence knew what 
he was up to when he made women, though I 




 

must say it looks sometimes as if he 'd made an 
awful botch of it." 

" Is he married ? " asked Yorke. 

" Who? Oh, Doctor Penhallow ? (I was think 
ing about Providence.) No. He 's an old bach," 
said Mrs. Butterwell in a mysterious manner, " and 
only one sister, and she just married and gone 
to Surinam to live. It seems to make it such a 
useful place ; I never felt as if anybody lived there 
before. He used to have to have her home in 
Bangor till a gracious mercy removed her, for she 
was squint-eyed and had spells. He was a friend 
of her father's, too." 

" Whose father 's ? " cried Yorke, desperately. 

" Why, Doctor 's father's, Doctor Zay 's
father 's. Old Doctor Lloyd and Doctor Penhallow 
were friends, the dearest kind ; he was his pre 
ceptor, too, and Doctor " 

" We are getting our pronouns, not to say our 
physicians, dreadfully mixed," interrupted the 
young man wearily. " And I suppose the lady 
has a right to her admirers, whether they meet 
our views or not. There really is nothing extraor 
dinary about it, except the fact that it should 
never have occurred to me that she could have 
them, in this wilderness." 

"Well, there ! I should like to know why not I " 



 

Mrs. Buttervvell fired at once. " You don't sup 
pose a woman ain't a woman because she 's a doctor, 
do you ? There was a fellow here last summer, 
a family of summer folks at the Sherman 
Hotel, three brothers : one was a minister, and one 
was an editor of something, I forget what, but 
he wasn't  a widower, that I'm sure of, and one 
had a patent on mouse-traps. I can't say much for 
the minister, for he preached on woman 's sphere 
in the Baptist church, may the Lord forgive 
him, if he ever heard the sermon, which*. I don't 
believe He did, and the mouse-trap was en 
gaged, besides having his froHt teeth out, and com 
ing down here to wait till he shrank for a new set. 
But that poor little editor, Mr. Yorke, I wish you 
could have made his acquaintance. The table-girl 
at the Sherman House told my girl he 'd lost his 
appetite to that pass he wouldn't  eat a thing but 
shoo-fly potatoes. Think," added Mrs. Butter- 
well, with a gravity which deepened to solemnity, 
" of supporting an honorable and unrequited affec 
tion on shoo-fly potatoes ! " 

"I did not know," observed Yorke, acutely con 
scious of the indiscretion of his remark, " that
