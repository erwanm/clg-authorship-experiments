He clasped the hand in his, and bowing reverently, kissed it. 

" I owe you a debt that can never be repaid," he returned 
brokenly. 

' ' No, no ;" turning her head away and speaking loudly. 

Then the mother and son were left alone. He placed his 
arm around her neck and drew the weary head to his broad 
shoulder. 

"It is God's hand. I have been a blind, insensate stone; 
nay worse, a doubter, a mocker. But last night I was alone 
with Him ! And when a man comes face to face with this 
strong arm he calls fate " 

"There is no such thing. It is God working in all and 
through all, resolving the tangles we make of our lives in our 
blind way. Our human wisdom is foolishness." 

He knew it then. He had cried out and kicked against 
the rough stones in his way, but not one had been placed there 
without a purpose, since through it all he had been led to see 
more clearly. Not that the old shame would be lifted, but 
made to serve a wise purpose in some way yet to be revealed. 
For humanity itself was growing to be a so much larger thing 
in his mind. When he saw how every simple act affected 
some other being for weal or woe, he understood how neces 
sary it was to keep the springs of the soul pure and true, to 
save one man from the mire and foulness all around, if he 



 

could do no more. It was not wealth or culture or ease 
and leisure that redeemed souls, although these helped, and 
his eyes were too clear now to rush to the other extreme and 
undervalue them; but they were not all. Back in the shop the 
men's coarseness and vile breath had annoyed him, yet he 
doubted if their sins were worse in God's sight than that of 
the refined and fastidious Kirke Gilliat. 

You will see that the old spirit of self-aggrandizement was 
falling off, like the dry, useless leaves that enclose the fruit- 
bud. They were needed once, for there is no purely useless 
thing in. the economy of nature ; and as a man's soul must 
be brave and earnest and helpful within before it can work 
profitably without, when it comes to blossom the unsightly 
husk may wither and drop it is not needed. He felt now that 
there was a wider work in the world than that for one's 
own self. 

' ' Yes, " glancing out to the barred sky of sapphire where 
the coming night brooded with infinite tenderness. "He" 
nodding to the adjoining room, "held the key to the mystery. 
I don't know whether God called him to give up his life and 
all, but to-night I would rather have his work, even to the 
poor, feeble souls which he has helped redeem, than anything 
Kirke Gilliat has done." 

She came and looked into his eyes, kissed him on the lips 
with speechless love, like a blessing after long waiting. 

"Not that I have come to that height where I can forgive 
him. We make our greatest mistakes in fancying that we can 
change the current of our natures in a few hours, when instead, 
it is a lifelong work." 

"And we find the old evils that we have imagined conquered 
coming back from the graves where we laid them. It is a war 
fare all along the way. The promise is 'to him that over- 
cometh.' " 

To him that overcometh evil. Not to him who wins the 
glories of this world fame, wealth, position, and honor alone. 



 

There was a better, broader sphere, the deep mystery of things 
unseen, that might gain neither reward nor simple justice in' 
this life ; but they were God's immutable laws, nevertheless, and 
on the other side of the sapphire sky He took these things into 
His own hands. 

Trewartha worked indefatigably. In less than a fortnight 
Jarvis had been found, concealed in a low den. When the 
braggadocio of liquor had been strong upon him, he had 
weakly made some damaging boasts. One circumstance after 
another, trivial in itself, came to light, and began to form a 
conclusive chain of evidence. Public opinion swayed at once, 
and Victor became a sort of hero, partly on account of his re 
markable escape from a doom planned for him. 

Another peculiar circumstance occurred, which brought with 
it a keen surprise and pleasure the sudden reappearance of 
Paul Latour, who had been searching vainly for his friend, 
and on the first tidings of his danger had found his way to 
Cragness. From him Trewartha and Milnor heard the episode 
at Bohmerwald, which exonerated Victor completely. 

With this array of evidence before the grand jury, the indict 
ment was changed, and Victor Hurst honorably cleared from 
the slightest suspicion. 

Milnor hastened to Rothermel with the tidings ; his sympa 
thies warmly enlisted in the young man's behalf. 

" I regret nothing so much as that I did not make a stronger 
effort to see him when Miss Lowndes wished me to. With all 
her shallow assumption she was right enough here." 

"You think him talented, then ?" 

The voice had a curiously hollow sound, and the hand on 
which Kirke Giiliat rested his face trembled visibly. 

" They are peculiar people all these Hursts. The mother 
has a quiet strength in her soft, sad eyes, and she worships her 
son passionately. I don't know what the father has been, for 
he is a paralytic now, and his brain has not escaped ; but the 
son's devotion to him, to them both, is remarkable. A strong, 




handsome youth, with a fine, rare soul, hitherto little under 
stood ; but he is in the right place now. My lifelong regret 
will be that I did not give him a helping hand in his hour of 
need." 

' ' He has genius, then ?" 

"That was where I stumbled. I was right in saying that he 
would never make a painter, but he has been exercising his 
talent in marble-cutting, and produced a bust of Sylvia Red 
mond which is really wonderful. I think with ten years of study 
and practice he might immortalize himself." 

Would it be too late to claim him, presently, to lavish upon 
him the gifts of Rothermel ? Rather it would be the proper 
atonement for all this early neglect and wrong. 

" You have not described him, yet you rouse me to a strange 
interest, " 

Milnor v/as softly pacing the antique room, with its painted 
panels and dark wainscoting, its diamonded windows with the 
light flickering quaintly through the small panes, the tall library 
across one end, and the family portraits ranged at even spaces 
down the sides. 

"There is something odd about the face that haunts me, 
as if I must have seen it before. Strong, resolute, handsome, 
with a blending of Greek and Saxon and a peculiar tawny tint 
of hair. Fiery, forceful, yet tempered with an inward grace." 

"Well," impatiently, when the pause had been very long, 
and the measured steps ceased. 

" He looks as if he might have kinship with your mother, 
Gilliat Yes, that must be it. What a strange resemblance !" 
glancing at the portrait. 

Kirke Gilliat said no more. His mother had been a queen 
among women, too early lost for him. If this Victor Hurst 
possessed half her nobleness ! 

He rose and tottered to the door. If, when the choice had 
been his to have a son who would love and honor him in 
his old age, a son of whom he could be proud . The old 



 

curse coming home. The mill grinding slowly but " exceed 
ing small."
