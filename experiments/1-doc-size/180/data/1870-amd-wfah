He faced Ruth for a moment, took her hand, and compelled 
her to look up, by his own strong personal magnetism. The 
fingers fairly trembled in his clasp. 

"Good-night." 

She heard Black Dick utter his fiery snort as his feet roused 
clattering echoes from the frozen ground. But there was no 
change in her face as she took up her neglected tatting. 

Only low in her heart there swept a sudden flood-tide of 
mysterious life which threatened to break down the barriers that 
had hitherto confined her soul a half-spiritual, half-physical 
power of resistance to a vague something that she could not 
understand, and with it all a sense of powerlessness. 

"She is jealous of Sylvia," mused Trewartha. "Sylvia, 
whom she loved like a kitten a month ago. And why ? Sylvia 
and Hurst were rather briery, I thought. What a plan that 
of Madame Janet's ! Ice and snow ! Yet if she falls into it 
readily !" 

He began to whistle a gay French chanson heard in a salon 
years ago, where soft voices and bright faces made a beguiling 
atmosphere. He was young in those days and had some 
hot blood in his veins. 

He lingered awhile over the lilies that night. 

"I used to think them like her. Well, they have a rare 
golden centre, a heart, but how about the soul of both ?" 

Victor and Trewartha set out for Taunton the next morn 
ing. Mrs. McRae, having her in-door business arranged to her 
satisfaction, went down to the mill ; while Ruth, being lady of 
the house, was courteous and attentive to Mrs. Hurst, and 
ordered the dinner. 

It was dusk of the crisp March day when the travellers 
returned. Miss Gamier was not called from her work this 



 

evening. Instead of the red and white chess-men there were 
slips of paper full of figures, estimates, much adding and 
discussion. 

"It is a solid bed of rock for miles and miles," said Mrs. 
McRae. "An excellent quality of stone, too; and the carting 
a mere nothing." 

"Cragness is famous for luck. There was an old copper- 
mine once somewhere about, and I dare say we shall discover 
gold at last." 

"Gold is a poor thing for the land in which it is found ;" 
with a disdainful jerk of her grand head. " We have developed 
industry, which is far better. The absence of any well- 
regulated system of labor affords loop-holes for every evil 
under the sun to creep in and flourish. An indolent com 
munity will be a miserable one." 

Victor smiled inwardly. He was growing too wise to rush 
out to battle for any small theory ; and he felt that Mrs. 
McRae was admirable in many ways. A little narrow, he 
sometimes fancied, and often dogmatic ; but her labors had 
certainly borne good fruit. 

" So, I shall turn the quarry over into your hands, young 
sir, making only one stipulation. There shall be no drunken 
ness, that curse of the cities." 

" But Hurst's workmen must of necessity be different from 
yours," explained Trewartha. "They will be rough men 
from the town, with no families and no flower-gardens to 
occupy their leisure moments." 

"There's not a pint of liquor to be bought in the village," 
she returned, testily. " If they bring their rum with them 
and drink it out of hours, I hardly know how it can be 
prevented ; but he shall make this rule the first man he 
finds under the influence of liquor shall be discharged. Tell 
them that in the beginning." 

"I will," he said, heartily, remembering how his father 
had fought against the demon of intemperance.

Janet McRae looked up at Doctor Trewartha in the most 
beatific triumph. 

"You are rabid Father Matthew crusaders," he said, with a 
short laugh. "I wish you would come over to the Cedars 
and take a bottle of wine with me. I have some choice, I 
assure you." 

"I have undertaken no crusade against you strong-brained 
people, who have plenty of money to spend, purchase the best 
always, and can afford to sleep all the morning when you have 
held an orgie over-night. It is for the poor wretches who 
starve their wives and children that they may buy vile, poison 
ous stuff that transforms them into something worse than brute 
beasts. If I cannot have the Cragness community sober, I'll 
close the workshops and nail up the cottage-doors. " 

It was her hobby to map out the duties and privileges of 
those who were in any manner subordinate, and Doctor Tre 
wartha confessed inwardly that the plan had not worked ill. 
There were a great many people in the world incapable of 
leading even themselves. 

In the course of a few days the matter was arranged satis 
factorily. Victor felt quite elated. 

" I am glad we came," he said to his mother. "There will 
be an opportunity to make something above our bare living. 
Mrs. McRae was very generous ; for after I had accepted it 
for half the profit, she was afraid that would not be enough ; 
but I am not willing to subject myself to any obligation that 
may gall me by-and-by. I want to remain quite unfettered." 

"Yes ;" with a little sigh. If it had been different. 

"We are to take the cottage. I thought you would like 
better to have a home of your own again. It is a pretty, quiet 
little place ; and here there will be guests coming and going 
continually." 

"It is much better." 

She spoke the simple truth. Indeed, there had been times 
when she felt almost stifled with the luxury for which she 



 

could make no return ; and the sense of supervision that clung 
about her like a shadow. 

As for Victor, he threw himself, heart and soul, into the 
new life. He was not likely to stint ambition or energy in an 
interest which promised as much as this. 

He found in Doctor Trewartha a staunch and peculiar 
friend. His experience in this respect had been rather limited ; 
and the secret in the depths of his soul disposed him to the 
cautiousness one hardly expects of youth. But this man was 
wonderfully fascinating, with his rich, varying moods, his vigor, 
when he chose to call it to the surface, his brilliancy; and the 
half-cynical, half-tender vein perplexed and pleased, lured 
onward, and yet never satisfied. 

By the middle of May they were settled in their new home. 
Ruth had supervised it with her housewifely instincts. Mrs. 
Hurst had drawn quite near to the girl during the past month. 
There was a restful quality in her grave nature, very grateful 
indeed to the woman who had been so long tried with sharp, 
irritable nerves and restless brains, and haunted by a tragic 
under-current. For Ruth had a broad, calm surface, like a 
fair lake, with no hint of storms. It is true that many of these 
women go through life without ever having been roused to one 
magnificent emotion. 

She took a warm interest in the Hursts, partly, perhaps, 
because she had been bidden so to do ; but there was some 
thing in the sad matron's gentleness, the hopeless invalidism 
of the husband, and the energy of the son, that attracted her 
more strongly than anything hitherto in her uneventful life : 
quite a new element at Cragness. Somehow she began to 
feel the burden of the swathing-bands wrapped around her by 
kind hands of friendship, and there were moments when she 
longed to tear them off if she but knew where to begin. A
