the estimable character of what you call your dilemma 
Now this fresh impression of mine — what do you pro- 
pose to do with it when you get it ? " 

" Such things are always useful. It will be a good 
thing to have." 

"I am much obliged to you ; but do you propose to 
let anything depend upon it ? Do you propose to take 
or to leave Miss Vivian — that is, to return to the 
charge or to give up trying — in consequence of my 
fresh impression ? " 

Gordon seemed perfectly unembarrassed by this 
question, in spite of the ironical light which it pro- 
jected upon his sentimental perplexity. 

" I propose to do what I choose ! " he said. 

" That 's a relief to me," Bernard rejoined. " This 
idea of yours is, after all, only the play of the scien- 
tific mind." 

"I shall contradict you flat if I choose," Gordon 
went on. 

" Ah, it 's well to warn me of that," said Bernard, 
laughing. " Even the most sincere judgment in the 
world likes to be notified a little of the danger of 
being contradicted." 

" Is yours the most sincere judgment in the world ?" 
Gordon demanded. 

" That 's a very pertinent question. Doesn 't it occur 
to you that you may have reason to be jealous — leav- 
ing me alone, with an open field, with the woman of 
youi choice ? " 





" I wish to heaven I could be jealous ! " Gordon 
exclaimed. "That would simplify the thing — that 
would give me a lift." 

And the next day, after some more talk, it seemed 
really with a hope of this contingency — though, 
indeed, he laughed abou*'- it — that he started for 
England. 



For the three or four days that followed Gordon 
Wright's departure, Bernard saw nothing of the 
ladies who had been committed to his charge. They 
chose to remain in seclusion, and he was at liberty to 
interpret this fact as an expression of regret at the 
loss of Gordon's good offices. He knew other people 
at Baden, and he went to see them and endeavored, 
by cultivating their society, to await in patience the 
re-appearance of Mrs. Vivian and her companions. 
But on the fourth day he became conscious that other 
people were much less interesting than the trio of 
American ladies who had lodgings above the confec- 
tioner's, and he made bold to go and knock at their 
door. He had been asked to take care of them, and 
this function presupposed contact. He had met Cap- 
tain Lovelock the day before, wandering about with 
a rather crest-fallen aspect, and the young English- 
man had questioned him eagerly as to the where- 
abouts of Mrs. Vivian. 

" Gad, I believe they 've left the place — left the 
place without giving a fellow warning ! " cried Love- 
lock. 





" Oh no, I think they are here still," said Bernard 
"My friend Wright has gone away for a week or 
two, but I suspect the ladies are simply staying at 
home." 

" Gad, I was afraid your friend Wright had taken 
them away with him ; he seems to keep them all in 
his pocket. I was afraid he had given them marching 
orders ; they 'd have been sure to go — they 're so 
awfully fond of his pocket ! I went to look them up 
yesterday — upon my word I did. They live at a 
baker's in a little back-street ; people do live in rum 
places when they come abroad ! But I assure you, 
when I got there, I 'm damned if I could make out 
whether they were there or not. I don't speak a 
word of German, and there was no one there but the 
baker's wife. She was a low brute of a woman — 
she couldn 't understand a word I said, though she 
gave me plenty of her own tongue. I had to give it 
up. They were not at home, but whether they had 
left Baden or not — that was beyond my finding out. 
If they are here, why the deuce don't they show ? 
Fancy coming to Baden-Baden to sit moping at a 
pastry-cook's ! " 

Captain Lovelock was evidently irritated, and it 
was Bernard's impression that the t,urn of luck over 
yonder where the gold-pieces were chinking had some- 
thing to do with the state of his temper. But more 
fortunate himself, he ascertained from the baker's 





 wife that though Mrs. Vivian and her daughter had 
gone out, their companion, " the youngest lady — the 
little young lady " — was above in the sitting-room. 

Blanche Evers was sitting at the window with a 
book, but she relinquished the volume with an alacrity 
that showed it had not been absorbing, and began to 
chatter with her customary frankness. 

" Well, I must say I am glad to see some one ! " 
cried the young girl, passing before the mirror and 
giving a touch to her charming tresses. 

" Even if it 's only me," Bernard exclaimed, laugh- 
ing. 

" I didn' t mean that. I am sure I am very glad to 
see you — I should think you would have found out 
that by this time. I mean I 'm glad to see any one 
— especially a man. I suppose it 's improper for me 
to say that — especially to you ! There — you see I 
do think more of you than of some gentlemen. Why 
especially to you ? Well, because you always seem 
to me to want to take advantage. I didn' t say a base 
advantage ; I didn' t accuse you of anything dreadful. 
I 'm sure I want to take advantage, too — I take it 
whenever I can. You see I take advantage of your 
being here — I 've got so many things to say. I 
haven 't spoken a word in three days, and I 'm sure it 
is a pleasant change — a gentleman's visit. All of a 
sudden we have gone into mourning ; I 'm sure I 
don't know who 's dead. Is it Mr. Gordbn Wright ? 





It 's some idea of Mrs. Vivian's — I 'm sure it isn 't 
mine. She thinks we have been often enough to the 
Kursaal. I don't know whether she thinks it 's 
wicked, or what. If it 's wicked the harm 's already 
done ; I can't be any worse than I am now. I have 
seen all the improper people and I have learnt all 
their names: Captain Lovelock has told me their 
names, plenty of times. I don't see what good it 
does me to be shut up here with all those names 
running in my ears. I must say I do prefer society. 
We haven 't been to the Kursaal for four days — we 
have only gone out for a drive. We have taken the 
most interminable drives. I do believe we have seen 
every old ruin in the whole country. Mrs. Vivian and 
Angela are so awfully fond of scenery — they talk 
about it by the half-hour. They talk about the moun- 
tains and trees as if they were people they knew — as 
if they were gentlemen ! I mean as if the mountains 
and trees were gentlemen. Of course scenery 's lovely, 
but you can't walk about with a tree. At any rate, 
that has been all our society — foliage ! Foliage and 
women ; but I suppose women are a sort of foliage. 
They are always rustling about and dropping off.
