store, that Tom might take his choice ; changing 
any and every arrangement at Tom’s suggestion, 
a dozen times a day; spoiling him by indulgence 
one minute, and worrying him by anxiety the 
next; behaving, generally, very much like 




Mr. Breynton. Tom was used to his father, 
and, though often worried out of good temper 
by his nervous peculiarities and particularities, 
yet he undoubtedly loved him, and loved him 
more than ever in these last days of home-life. 
He would have been a very ungrateful boy if he 
had not. 

As for his mother, who could tell what there 
was that she did not do? For weeks she had 
scarcely been seen without her thimble. No 
one but herself knew exactly how much sewing 
she had done. So many shirts to be cut, 
button-holes to make, wrist-bands to stitch ; so 
much mending and making over ; so much 
planning and contriving to make a little go a 
great way ; so much care to sponge up old coats 
and re-bind old vests, that might save the new a 
little, and yet never make the boy ashamed of 
them. Such pies and doughnuts, such cookies 
and stray bunches of grapes, and mellow, golden 
pears, as she had collected on the pantry shelf, 
to adorn the table during Tom’s “ last days,” or 
to tuck into corners of his trunk. Such scraps 

 


of gentle lessons about this strange life into 
which he was going, as she gave him sometimes 
when they sat together in the twilight; such 
soft kisses as fell on his forehead when she said 
good-night at last, — these were best of all ; 
and so Tom thought, though he never said so. 
Was there ever a boy of seventeen who did? 

Neither was Winnie by any means inactive. 
For ten days before Tom went, had he not 
spasmodic attacks of “ popping corn for Tom, 
sir, and you might just let him alone, sir?” 
And did he not collect just twenty-five corns, of 
which twenty were burnt, and three had never 
“ popped ” at all, tie them up in an old lace 
bag, and carry them in his pocket morning, 
noon, and night, to say nothing of sleeping 
with them under his pillow? And is it not 
recorded that the bag burst, and the contents 
one by one grew small by degrees and beautifully 
less, but that Winnie didn’t mind that in 
the least ; how he finally pinned it with a rusty 
pin on the cleanest collar he could find in the 
trunk, and how he believes to this day that Tom 

ate every one of those corns, with a faith that 
amounts to sublimity? 

Even Patty must contribute her mite, and, 
having a vague idea that a collegian was always 
glad of an addition to his library, what should 
she do but purchase a Biography of the Blessed 
Mary, profusely illustrated in gamboge and 
vermilion, and hope “ Misther Tom would 
take it kindly, and be a good boy, poor fellow ! ” 

But to no one in the family was Tom’s going 
away just what it was to Gypsy. Even his 
mother could not miss him as she should. 
Tom was very much to her. Since they were 
little children it had been just so. They had 
rolled hoop, and played marbles, and played 
horse, and baked mud-pies together; as they 
grew older, no boating, riding, skating, and 
base-ball were quite complete unless they could 
share them together. Tom was very proud of 
Gypsy, — “she didn’t scream or faint; and if 
he had any particular abhorrence it was a 
screaming, fainting girl. She could handle her 
oar very well, really very well, — under his 
teaching. She was always on hand for any 
fun, and never spoiled things by ‘ being nervous.’ 
Besides, she mended a fellow’s gloves 
without scolding, and if you put her in a parlour 
she was as much of a lady as anybody.” 

Gypsy was very proud of Tom. “ Tom was 
so tall. Tom was handsome. All the girls 
liked Tom. Tom was so generous, too, and 
good, and let her go about with him. Tom 
never scolded. Make fun of her? Oh, yes, 
he did that, but she didn’t care ; she should 
miss that as much as anything. To have Tom 
gone, — gone hour after hour, day in and day 
out, week upon week, — why, it seemed like 
cutting a piece of her life right out.” 

Some such thought as this was in her mind as 
she sat alone in the twilight which had gathered 
and deepened, her work lying idly in her lap, — 
it was quite too dark to sew now, — and her 
eyes looking sadly off into the dying west. In 
the midst of the thought there came a great 
noise, — a banging and pounding and scraping 
on the garret floor ; then a banging and pounding 
and scraping and jouncing and bouncing 
down the stairs. Gypsy jumped up, wonder- 
ing what had happened, and opened the door to 
see. A huge brown trunk, and Tom behind it. 

“ Oh, Tom ; ” 

“ Oh, Gypsy ! ” 

“ Not the trunk, so soon?” 

“ Yes, the trunk, so soon. Going to begin 
to pack to-morrow morning; so I thought I’d 
have her on hand, as I hadn’t anything else to 
do this particular minute.” 

“ Pack to-morrow ! ” 

“ Couldn’t pack Sunday very well. Don’t 
you remember what the catechism says about 
it?” 

“ But it seems so — so — ” 

“ So what? ” 

“So — why, so exactly as if you were 
going off.” 

Tom sat down on the trunk to fan himself 
with his hat and laugh. Gypsy did not join in 
the laugh; she slipped away, and when Tom 
had carried the trunk down, and dusted it out 




(with a clean handkerchief), and put in his 
blacking-box on top of his shirt, “just to see 
how things were going to look,” he missed 
her. After a long and fruitless hunt, he went 
up garret, 

“ Gypsy, are you here? ” 

Something stirred faintly in an old trunk that 
stood under the eaves, and there sat Gypsy all 
in a heap, with something very suspiciously 
bright in both eyes. Tom stared. 

“ If you could inform the inquiring mind 
what you are supposed to be doing?” 

“ I believe — I came up to — cry,” said 
Gypsy. 

“ My dear, I would not be such a goose.” 

“ On the whole, I don’t think I will,” said 
Gypsy, and jumped out of the trunk, rubbing 
both fists into her eyes. 

As they went past her room — 

“ What were you locked up so long for to 
night?” asked Tom. 

“ Oh, something. I ’ll let you know — let me
