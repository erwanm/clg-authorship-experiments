and I want your advice ; but I don't know 
what you will think of me after you have read 
this letter." 

" Never mind ; give it to me, Brownie. You 
have always been my dear, little cousin, and it 
will take more than a letter to separate us,' said 
Hugh, opening the envelope. The letter was as 
follows ; " Miss B. Daril : I don't want to 
trouble you, but I must have that money. Bills 
is coming in every day. It belongs to me, as you 
know yourself, Miss, very well, and I've a right 
to every cent. If it don't come soon I shall 
have to send a lawyer for it, which I hate to do, 
Miss ; and am yours respectful, J. Evins." 

" What can this mean, Bessie? " asked Hugh, 
in astonishment. 

" It means, last winter, at Feather ton Hall, 



 

Hugh, I got into a wild set of girls there, and 
one of our amusements was sending out for sup- 
pers late in the evening ; the servants would do 
anything for money, and they were always will- 
ing to go over to Evins, and get what we wanted 
for a small bribe. The bill was allowed to run 
on in my name, for, although it was understood 
that all the dormitory girls should share in the ex- 
pense, it was more convenient to order in one 
name. Then the end of the term came, .and 
there was so much confusion and hurry, that most 
of the girls forgot all about the bill, and went 
home without paying anything towards the sup- 
pers. I fully intended to give my share to Evins 
before I left, but the amount was so large I 
could not come near it," concluded Bessie, with 
two tears rolling down her cheeks. 

' ; You have not told Aunt Faith, then," asked 
Hugh. 

" No ; I do not want to tell her, for it would 
make her feel badly, and besides, she would pay 
it herself, and I don't want her to do that, for 

she has already taken ever so much of her own 
little income to buy me new summer dresses in 
place of those I have torn and stained." 

" How much do you owe this man ? " said Hugh 
gravely. 

" Two hundred and fifty dollars," said Bessie 
desperately. 

" How could you contrive to run up such a 
bill in one winter ? " exclaimed Huo-h in astonishment. 

" Why, you see there were a good many girls 
in the dormitory, and we always had plum-cake, 
eclairs, and French candy ; and then I have no 
doubt but that the servants took their share," 
said Bessie, with a half sob. 

"And why was your name selected for the 
bills ? " 

" I don't know, unless because I was, — the, — 
the,—" 

" The ringleader ? " suggested Hugh. 

" I am afraid so," murmured Bessie, hiding 
her face. 


" Have you got this man's bill ? " said Hugh, 
afte" a pause. 

" Ah ! yes. He sent it to me weeks ago." 

" Let me have it," please." 

" Oh, Hugh ! what are you going to do with 
it?" 

" Pay it, of course." 

"Pay it! How can you?" 

" So long as it is paid, what do you care about 
it, Brownie ? " 

" But I do care, Hugh ; and I shall not give it 
to you unless you tell me." 

" Well then, listen, Miss Obstinate. You 
may not know that Sibyl and I have some money 
coming to us this month. We shall be quite 
rich. I shouldn't wonder if there were five hun- 
dred dollars in all. Quite a fortune, you see ! 
And I shall take mine to pay the debts of my 
foolish little cousin, who must be a real sugar- 
dolly to have eaten so much candy," said Hugh, 
laughing. 

" Oh, Hugh ! you splendid, generous fellow !



 

said Bessie, with the tears still shining in her 
eyes ; " but I shall not let you do it." 

" Yes you will, Bessie ; you would do the 
same for me." 

" That is true enough : but I hate to take your 
money, Hugh." 

" You don't take it ; * J. Evins ' takes it," said 
Hugh merrily. " Come, give me the bill, and 
say no more about it, or we shall quarrel." So 
it was settled, and there were two light hearts 
in the studio that bright June morning. 

While Aunt Faith was busy with her house- 
keeping duties, she heard Sibyl's touch on the 
piano, — giving full value to every note, and 
exact iime to every measure. Sibyl was an ac- 
curate musician, and several hours of each day 
were invariably devoted to piano practice. She 
never turned over a pile of sheet-music, trying 
now a little of this, and now a little of that ; but, 
having made her selections, she played the piece 
entirely through, note for note, exactly as it was 
written. Most people liked to hear Miss War- 



 

rington play, for the performance was very complete. 
She sat gracefully at the piano, showed 
no nervous anxiety, interpreted the notes 
conscientiously, and finished the music to the very last- 
octave. But Aunt Faith detected a want of ex- 
pression in this studied mechanism ; it seemed to 
her that Sibyl did not, in her heart, feel the spirit 
of the music which her fingers played. Coming 
in from the kitchen, this morning, after setting in 
motion the household wheels for the day, she 
again noticed this automatic execution in the 
strains of Mendelssohn's " Spring-Song," and it 
grated on her ear as she tended the hanging bas- 
kets on the piazza. Continuing her round from 
her plants to her birds and gold-fish, Aunt Faith 
kept listening to the monotonous sound of the 
piano. " I wonder if Sibyl has a heart ? " she 
thought ; " sometimes I am tempted to think she 
has none. How can she practise so steadily 
when she has so much to decide ? This visit to 
Saratoga will mean more than it looks. The decision
will be between religion and the world 

If she deliberately makes up her mind to go, it 
will show me that Mr. Leslie's influence has not 
been strong enough to subdue her worldliness 
and secret ambition. Poor child ! she is like her 
mother. And yet, Mabel Fitzhugh became an 
earnest Christian before she died. God grant 
that her daughter may grow in grace also. Hugh, 
now, is all Warrington ; he is like his father, 
with all his father's faults and all his father's
