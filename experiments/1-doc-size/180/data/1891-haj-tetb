night."

"No. Good morning."

The stranger went out, directing his steps toward the Falls.

An hour later a quiet-looking man entered the office.

"Good morning, Mr. Ferguson," said the clerk. "What brings you here so
early?"

"Business," answered the other briefly. "Did you have any late arrivals
last evening?"

"Yes; two."

"Who were they?"

"A man and boy."

"Are they here still?"

"The boy is up-stairs. The man left at six o'clock. He wanted to see
the Falls before taking an early train. He said the boy seemed very
nervous, and had a troubled sleep."

The detective nodded. "I think he must be the party I want."

"Why, what has happened?"

"The house of a wealthy old gentleman in Elmira was entered yesterday
afternoon, and articles of value taken. I received a telegram this
morning which should have reached me last night, asking me to be on the
watch for any suspicious parties."

"And you think the boy committed the burglary?" asked the clerk in
excitement.

"It looks like it. With your permission I will go up-stairs and take a
look at him."




CHAPTER XI.

FRED FALLS UNDER A TERRIBLE SUSPICION.

About ten minutes before the arrival of the detective Fred woke up. He
generally awoke earlier, but his long ride of the day before had
fatigued him more than usual. It was natural for him to glance over to
the opposite bed, occupied by his traveling companion. He was surprised
to find it empty.

"He must have got up early," thought Fred. "I wonder if he has gone for
good."

This seemed likely, for the stranger's valise had disappeared also.

"I wonder he didn't wake me up and bid me good-by," thought the train
boy.

Then a momentary suspicion led him to search for the hundred dollars in
gold which he had carefully concealed in his inside vest pocket. If
that were taken, he would be in a quandary, for there would be little
chance of his being able to make up the loss to his friend, the Western
miner.

He found, to his relief, that the gold had not been touched, and he
reproached himself for the injustice he had in his thoughts, done his
late room-mate.

"Well," soliloquized Fred, as he lazily got out of bed and drew on his
clothes, "I am not sorry to have the room alone. If I could have a
friend from home with me I should like it, but I don't care for the
company of a stranger."

Fred reflected that he had all the day to himself. He could hear the
roar of the famous cataract, which he had not yet seen on account of
his late arrival the night before, and he determined to go there
immediately after breakfast, or even before breakfast if he found that
it was quite near. He went to the window and looked out, but it was not
in sight.

"I may as well put on a clean shirt," thought Fred, and he went to the
table to open the bundle which he had brought from Jersey City. He had
just unfastened the string when a quick, imperative knock was heard at
the door of his room.

"Come in!" said Fred, with some surprise.

He turned his face to the door, and his wonder increased as it opened
and he saw the clerk and a stranger standing on the threshold. They
entered the room and closed the door behind them.

"What is the matter?" asked the train boy. "Has anything happened?"

"When did your room-mate leave?" asked the detective, not answering his
question.

"I don't know; I only just woke up."

"Did you rest well?"

"That's a very queer question to ask me," thought Fred. "Yes," he
answered, "I rested very well."

The detective and the clerk exchanged glances. This statement did not
accord with what Fred's room-mate had said down-stairs.

"The bed was very comfortable," added Fred by way of compliment to the
house.

"I am glad you found it so," said the detective dryly.

"Did you come upstairs to ask how I rested?' asked Fred, with a smile.

"You are sharp, my young friend," said the detective, "and I think I
may say wonderfully cool under the circumstances."

"Under what circumstances?" asked Fred, his attention drawn to the last
part of the detective's speech.

"There was a burglary committed yesterday afternoon in Elmira," said
the detective, fastening his eyes keenly on the face of the train boy.

"Was there?" asked Fred, not seeing in what way this information was
likely to affect him. "I thought most burglaries were committed in the
night."

"They are, generally, but this was an exception. There was no one in
the house except old Mr. Carver, who is quite hard of hearing. The
burglary probably took place about five o'clock, and the burglar is
supposed to have taken the 5:51 train from Elmira."

"Why, that is the train I was on," said Fred in surprise.

"By a curious coincidence," said the detective with a queer smile, "it
was by your train that the burglar probably traveled."

His tone was so significant that Fred asked quickly, "What do you
mean?"

"I mean, my young friend," said the detective, "that you are suspected
to know something of this affair."

"If you are a detective," retorted Fred, "I don think much of your
sharpness. I have never been in Elmira in my life."

"Probably not," said Ferguson, the detective, with a provoking smile.

"I passed through there yesterday on my way from New York. With that
exception, I never saw the place."

"That may be true," said the detective cautiously, "or it may not. I
will take the liberty of examining your luggage to see if I can find
any of the stolen articles."

"You are welcome to do it," said Fred.

"Bring it out then. Where have you put it--under the bed?"

"All the luggage I have is in this bundle," said the train boy. "You
can open that if you think it will do you any good."

"You are sure you have no valise?"

Ferguson, who, like most of his class, was suspicious, peeped under
each bed, but found nothing to reward his search. Somewhat
disappointed, he went to the table and opened the newspaper bundle. He
did so listlessly, not really expecting to find anything, but as he
unrolled Fred's shirt there was a triumphant look in his eyes when he
uncovered the gold watch and chain.

"Just as I thought," he said, with a nod to the clerk.

"What is that?' gasped Fred.

"It appears to be a watch and chain," answered Ferguson coolly.
"Possibly you can tell me how it came there."
