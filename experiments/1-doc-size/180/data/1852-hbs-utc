was baking. He put a few bits of brushwood on the fire, 
and strove to raise the light, and then drew his worn Bible 
from his pocket. There were all the marked passages which 
had thrilled his soul so often words of patriarchs and seers, 
poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to 
man voices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever 
surround us in the race of life. Had the word lost its 
power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer 
answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration ? Heavily 
sighing, he put it in his pocket. A coarse laugh roused 
him ; he looked up Legree was standing opposite to him. 

"Well, old boy," he said, "you find your religion don't 
work, it seems ! I thought I should get that through your 
wool at last ! " 

The cruel taunt was more than hunger, and cold, and 
nakedness. Tom was silent. 

" You were a fool," said Legree ; " for I meant to do well 
by you when I bought you. You might have been better 
off than Sambo, or Quimbo either, and had easy times ; and, 
instead of getting cut up and thrashed every day or two, ye 
might have had liberty to lord it round, and cut up the 
other niggers ; and ye might have had, now and then, a good 
warming of whiskey-punch. Come, Tom, don't you think 
you'd better be reasonable ? Heave that ar' old pack of 
trash in the fire and join my church ! " 

" The Lord forbid'! " said Tom, fervently. 

" You see the Lord an't going to help you ; if he had 
been, he wouldn't have let me get you ! This yer religion is 
all a mess of lying trumpery, Tom. I know all about it. 
Te'd better hold to me ; I'm somebody, and can do 
something ! " 

" No, mas'r," said Tom, " I'll hold on. The Lord may 
help me, or not help ; but I'll hold to Him, and believe Him 
to the last ! " 

" The more fool you ! " said Legree, spitting scornfully at 
him, and spurning him with his foot. " Never mind, I'll 
chase you down yet, and bring you under, you'll see ! " and 
Legree turned away. 

"When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level 
at which endurance is possible, there is an instant and des- 
perate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off 





the weight ; and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes 
'a return tide of joy and courage. So was it now with Tom. 
The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before dejected soul to the lowest ebb ; and though the hand of faith 
still held to the eternal Rock, it was with a numb, despairing 
grasp. Tom sat like one stunned at the fire. Suddenly 
everything around him seemed to fade, and a vision rose 
before him of One crowned with thorns, buffeted and 
bleeding. Tom gazed in awe and wonder at the majestic 
patience of the face ; the deep pathetic eyes thrilled him to 
his inmost heart ; his soul woke, as, with floods of emotion, 
he stretched out his hands and fell upon his knees ; when 
gradually the vision changed, the sharp thorns became rays 
of glory, and in splendour inconceivable he saw that same 
face bending compassionately towards him, and a voice said, 
" He that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, 
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father 
on his throne." 

How long Tom lay there he knew not. "When he came 
to himself, the fire was gone out, his clothes were wet with 
the chill and drenching dews ; but the dread soul-crisis was 
past, and, in the joy that filled him, he no longer felt hunger, 
cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness. From his 
deepest soul, he that hour loosed and parted from every hope 
in the life that now is, and offered his own will an unques- 
tioning sacrifice to the Infinite. Tom looked up to the 
silent, ever-living stars, types of the angelic hosts who ever 
look down on man ; and the solitude of the night rung with 
the triumphant words of a hymn, which he had sung often 
in happier days, but never with such feeling as now : 

" The earth shall be dissolved like snow, 

The sun shall cease to shine ; 
But God, who called me here below, 
Shall be for ever mine. 

" And when this mortal life shall fail, 

And flesh and sense shall cease, 
I shall possess within the veil 
A life of joy and peace. 

" When we've been there ten thousand years 

Bright shining like the sun, 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun." 




Those who have been familiar with the religious histories 
of the slave-population, know that relations like what we 
have narrated are very common among them. We have 
heard some from their own lips of a very touching and 
affecting character. The psychologist tells us of a state in 
which the affections and images of the mind become so 
dominant and overpowering, that they press into their 
service the outward senses, and make them give tangible 
shape to the inward imagining. Who shall measure what 
an all-pervading Spirit may do with these capabilities of our 
mortality, or the ways in which He may encourage the 
desponding souls of the desolate ? If the poor forgotten 
slave believes that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him, 
who shall contradict him ? Did He not say that His mission 
in all ages was to bind up the broken-hearted, and set at 
liberty them that are bruised ? 

When the dim grey of dawn woke the slumberers to go 
forth to the field, there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread ; for 
firmer than the ground he trod on was his strong faith in 
almighty, eternal Love. Ah, Legree! try all your forces 
now ! Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of 
all things, shall only hasten on the process by which he shall 
be made a king and a priest unto God ! 

From this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed 
the lowly heart of the oppressed one an ever-present 
Saviour hallowed it as a temple. Past now the bleeding of 
earthly regrets past its fluctuations of hope, and fear, and 
desire the human will, bent and bleeding, and struggling 
long, was now entirely merged in the divine. So short now 
seemed the remaining voyage of life so near, so vivid, 
seemed eternal blessedness that life's uttermost woes fell 
from him unharming. 

All noticed the change in his appearance. Cheerfulness 
and alertness seemed to return to him, and a quietness 
which no insult or injury could ruffle seemed to possess 
him. 

" What the devil's got into Tom ?" Legree said to Sambo. 
" A while ago he was all down in the mouth, and now he's 
peart as a cricket." 

" Dunno, mas'r ! gwine to run off, mebbe." 





" Like to see him try that," said Legree, with a savage 
grin ; " wouldn't we, Sambo ?" 

" Gruess we would ! haw ! haw ! ho !" said the sooty gnome, 
laughing obsequiously. " Lord, de fun ! To see him stickin' 
in the mud, chasin' and tearin' through de bushes, dogs 
a-holdin' on to him ! Lord, I laughed fit to split, dat ar' 
time we cotched Molly. I thought they'd had her all stripped 
up afore I could get 'em off. She car's de marks o' dat ar' 
spree yet." 

"I reckon she will to her grave," said Legree. "But 
now, Sambo, you look sharp ! If the nigger's got anything 
of this sort going, trip him up." 

" Mas'r, let me 'lone for dat !" said Sambo. " I'll tree de 
coon! Ho! ho! ho!" 

This was spoken as Legree was getting on to his horse to go 
to the neighbouring town. That night, as he was returning, 
he thought he would turn his horse and ride round the 
quarters, and see if all was safe.
