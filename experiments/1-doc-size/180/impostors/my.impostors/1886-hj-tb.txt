might learn through Mrs. Luna ; that would almost reconcile 
him to going to see her again. Olive would mention it in 
writing to her sister, and Adeline would repeat the complaint. 
Perhaps she herself would even make him a scene about it ; 
that would be, for him, part of the unhappiness he had 
foretold to Verena Tarrant. 



XXVI. 

'MRS. HENRY BURRAGE, at home Wednesday evening, 
March 26th, at half-past nine o'clock.' It was in con- 
sequence of having received a card with these words 
inscribed upon it that Basil Ransom presented himself, on 
the evening she had designated, at the house of a lady he 
had never heard of before. The account of the relation of 
effect to cause is not complete, however, unless I mention 
that the card bore, furthermore, in the left-hand lower 
corner, the words : 'An Address from Miss Verena Tarrant.' 
He had an idea (it came mainly from the look and even the 
odour of the engraved pasteboard), that Mrs. Burrage was a 
member of the fashionable world, and it was with consider- 
able surprise that he found himself in such an element. 
He wondered what had induced a denizen of that fine air 
to send him an invitation ; then he said to himself that, 
obviously, Verena Tarrant had simply requested that this 
should be done. Mrs. Henry Burrage, whoever she might 
be, had asked her if she shouldn't like some of her own 
friends to be present, and she had said, Oh yes, and 
mentioned him in the happy group. She had been able to 
give Mrs. Burrage his address, for had it not been contained 
in the short letter he despatched to Monadnoc Place soon 
after his return from Boston, in which he thanked Miss 
Tarrant afresh for the charming hour she had enabled him 
to spend at Cambridge ? She had not answered his letter at 
the time, but Mrs. Burrage's card was a very good answer. 
Such a missive deserved a rejoinder, and it was by way of 
rejoinder that he entered the street car which, on the 
evening of March 26th, was to deposit him at a corner 
adjacent to Mrs. Burrage's dwelling. He almost never 
went to evening parties (he knew scarcely any one who 



 

gave them, though Mrs. Luna had broken him in a little), 
and he was sure this occasion was of festive intention, would 
have nothing in common with the nocturnal ' exercises ' at 
Miss Birdseye's; but he would have exposed himself to 
almost any social discomfort in order to see Verena Tarrant 
on the platform. The platform it evidently was to be 
private if not public since one was admitted by a ticket 
given away if not sold. He took his in his pocket, quite 
ready to present it at the door. It would take some time 
for me to explain the contradiction to the reader ; but Basil 
Ransom's desire to be present at one of Verena's regular 
performances was not diminished by the fact that he 
detested her views and thought the whole business a poor 
perversity. He understood her now very well (since his visit 
to Cambridge) ; he saw she was honest and natural ; she 
had queer, bad lecture-blood in her veins, and a comically 
false idea of the aptitude of little girls for conducting 
movements ; but her enthusiasm was of the purest, her 
illusions had a fragrance, and so far as the mania for pro- 
ducing herself personally was concerned, it had been 
distilled into her by people who worked her for ends which 
to Basil Ransom could only appear insane. She was a 
touching, ingenuous victim, unconscious of the pernicious 
forces which were hurrying her to her ruin. With this idea 
of ruin there had already associated itself in the young 
man's mind, the idea a good deal more dim and incom- 
plete of rescue; and it was the disposition to confirm 
himself in the view that her charm was her own, and 
her fallacies, her absurdity, a mere reflection of unlucky 
circumstance, that led him to make an effort to behold her 
in the position in which he could least bear to think of her. 
Such a glimpse was all that was wanted to prove to him 
that she was a person for whom he might open an unlimited 
credit of tender compassion. He expected to suffer to 
suffer deliciously. 

By the time he had crossed Mrs. Burrage's threshold 
there was no doubt whatever in his mind that he was in the 
fashionable world. It was embodied strikingly in the stout, 
elderly, ugly lady, dressed in a brilliant colour, with a 
twinkle of jewels and a bosom much uncovered, who stood 



 

near the door of the first room, and with whom the people 
passing in before him were shaking hands. Ransom made 
her a Mississippian bow, and she said she was delighted to 
see him, while people behind him pressed him forward. 
He yielded to the impulsion, and found himself in a great 
saloon, amid lights and flowers, where the company was 
dense, and there were more twinkling, smiling ladies, with 
uncovered bosoms. It was certainly the fashionable world, 
for there was no one there whom he had ever seen before. 
The walls of the room were covered with pictures the very 
ceiling was painted and framed. The people pushed each 
other a little, edged about, advanced and retreated, looking 
at each other with differing faces sometimes blandly, 
unperceivingly, sometimes with a harshness of contempla- 
tion, a kind of cruelty, Ransom thought ; sometimes with 
sudden nods and grimaces, inarticulate murmurs, followed 
by a quick reaction, a sort of gloom. He was now 
absolutely certain that he was in the best society. He was 
carried further and further forward, and saw that another 
room stretched beyond the one he had entered, in which 
there was a sort of little stage, covered with a red cloth, 
and an immense collection of chairs, arranged in rows. He 
became aware that people looked at him, as well as at each 
other, rather more, indeed, than at each other, and he 
wondered whether it were very visible in his appearance that 
his being there was a kind of exception. He didn't know how 
much his head looked over the heads of others, or that his 
brown complexion, fuliginous eye, and straight black hair, 
the leonine fall of which I mentioned in the first pages of 
this .narrative, gave him that relief which, in the best society, 
has the great advantage of suggesting a topic. But there 
were other topics besides, as was proved by a fragment of 
conversation, between two ladies, which reached his ear 
while he stood rather wistfully wondering where Verena 
Tarrant might be. 

'Are you a member?' one of the ladies said to the 
other. ' I didn't know you had joined.' 

' Oh, I haven't ; nothing would induce me.' 
'  That's not fair ; you have all the fun and none of the 
responsibility.' 



 

'  Oh, the fun the fun !' exclaimed the second lady. 

'You needn't abuse us, or I will never invite you,' said 
the first. 

' Well, I thought it was meant to be improving ; that's 
all I mean ; very good for the mind. Now, this woman 
to-night ; isn't she from Boston ? ' 

'Yes, I believe they have brought her on, just for this.' 

' Well, you must be pretty desperate when you have got 
to go to Boston for your entertainment.' 

' Well, there's a similar society there, and I never heard 
of their sending to New York.' 

' Of course not, they think they have got everything. 
But doesn't it make your life a burden, thinking what you 
can possibly have?' 

' Oh dear, no. I am going to have Professor Gougen- 
heim all about the Talmud. You must come.' 

'  Well, I'll come,' said the second lady ; ' but nothing 
would induce me to be a regular member.' 

Whatever the mystic circle might be, Ransom agreed 
with the second lady that regular membership must have 
terrors, and he admired her independence in such an 
artificial world. A considerable part of the company had 
now directed itself to the further apartment people had 
begun to occupy the chairs, to confront the empty platform. 
He reached the wide doors, and saw that the place was a 
spacious music-room, decorated in white and gold, with a 
polished floor and marble busts of composers, on brackets 
attached to the delicate panels. He forbore to enter, how- 
ever, being shy about taking a seat, and seeing that the 
ladies were arranging themselves first. He turned back 
into the first room, to wait till the audience had massed
