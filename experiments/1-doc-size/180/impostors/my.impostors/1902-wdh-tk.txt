to keep away from her, but as she appeared anxious 
to escape him, and had to be entreated, as it were, 
to suffer his society, something better than his curi 
osity was piqued, though that was piqued, too. He 
believed that he saw her lapsing again into that 
morbid state from which he had seemed once able 
to save her, and he could not help trying again. 
He was the more bound to do so by the ironical 
observance of Miss Easmith, who had to be defied 
at first, and then propitiated; certainly, when she 
saw him apparently breaking faith with her, she 
had a right to some sort of explanation, but certain 
ly also she had no right to a blind and unreasoning 
submission from him. His embarrassment was 
heightened by her interest in Miss Kenton, whom, 
with an admirable show of now finding her safe 
from Breckon 's attractions, she was always wishing 
to study from his observation. What was she really 
like? The girl had a perfect fascination for her; 
she envied him his opportunities of knowing her, 
and his privileges of making that melancholy face 
light up with that heart-breaking smile, and of 
banishing that delicious shyness with which she 



 

always seemed to meet him. Miss Rasmith had 
noticed it; how could she help noticing it? 

Breckon wished to himself that she had been 
able to help noticing it, or were more capable of 
minding her own business than she showed herself, 
and his heart closed about Ellen with a tenderness 
that was dangerously indignant. At the same time 
he felt himself withheld by Miss Rasmith 's witness 
from being all to the girl that he wished to be, 
and that he now seemed to have been in those first 
days of storm, while Miss Rasmith and her mother 
were still keeping their cabin. He foresaw that it 
would end in Miss Rasmith 's sympathetic nature 
not being able to withhold itself from Ellen 's need 
of cheerful companionship, and he was surprised 
as little as he was pleased, one morning, when he 
came to take the chair beside her to find Miss Ras 
mith in it, talking and laughing to the girl, who 
perversely showed herself amused. Miss Rasmith 
made as if to offer him the seat, but he had to 
go away disappointed, after standing long enough 
before them to be aware that they were suspending 
some topic while he stayed. 

He naturally supposed the topic to be himself, 
but it was not so, or at least not directly so. It 
was only himself as related to the scolding he had 
given Miss Rasmith for trifling with the innocence 
of Boyne, which she wished Miss Kenton to under 
stand as the effect of a real affection for her brother. 
She loved all boys, and Boyne was simply the most 
delightful creature in the world. She went on to 



 

explain how delightful he was, and she showed such 
an appreciation of the infantile sweetness mingled 
with the mature severity of Boyne 's character that 
Ellen could not help being pleased and won. She 
told some little stories of Boyne that threw a light 
also on their home life in Tuskingum, and Miss 
Easmith declared herself perfectly fascinated, and 
wished that she could go and live in Tuskingum. 
She protested that she should not find it dull ; Boyne 
alone would be entertainment enough; and she fig 
ured a circumstance so idyllic from the hints she 
had gathered, that Ellen 's brow darkened in silent 
denial, and Miss Kasmith felt herself, as the chil 
dren say in the game, very hot in her proximity 
to the girl 's secret. She would have liked to know 
it, but whether she felt that she could know it when 
she liked enough, or whether she should not be 
so safe with Breckon in knowing it, she veered sud 
denly away, and said that she was so glad to have 
Boyne 's family know the peculiar nature of her de 
votion, which did not necessarily mean running 
away with him, though it might come to that. She 
supposed she was a little morbid about it from what 
Mr. Breckon had been saying; he had a conscience 
that would break the peace of a whole community, 
though he was the greatest possible favorite, not 
only with his own congregation, which simply wor 
shipped him, but with the best society, where he 
was in constant request. 

It was not her fault if she did not overdo these 
phases of his contemporary history, but perhaps it 



 

was all true about the number of girls who were 
ready and willing to marry him. It might even 
be true, though she had no direct authority for 
saying it, that he had made up his mind never to 
marry, and that was the reason why he felt himself 
so safe in being the nicest sort of friend. He was 
safe, Miss Rasmith philosophized, but whether other 
people were so safe was a different question. There 
were girls who were said to be dying for him; but 
of course those things were always said about a 
handsome young minister. She had frankly taken 
him on his own ground, from the beginning, and 
she believed that this was what he liked. At any 
rate, they had agreed that they were never to be 
anything but the best of friends, and they always 
had been. 

Mrs. Kenton came and shyly took the chair on 
Miss Rasmith 's other side, and Miss Rasmith said 
they had been talking about Mr. Breckon, and she 
repeated what she had been saying to Ellen. Mrs. 
Kenton assented more openly than Ellen could to 
her praises, but when she went away, and her daugh 
ter sat passive, without comment or apparent in 
terest, the mother drew a long, involuntary sigh. 

"Do you like her, Ellen?" 

" She tries to be pleasant, I think." 

" Do you think she really knows much about Mr. 
Breckon?" 

"Oh yes. Why not? She belongs to his church." 

" He doesn 't seem to me like a person who would 
have a parcel of girls tagging after him." 



 

" That is what they do in the East, Boyne says." 
" I wish she would let Boyne alone. She is mak 
ing a fool of the child. He 's round with her every 
moment. I think she ought to be ashamed, such an 
old thing!" 

Ellen chose to protest, or thought it fair to do 
so. " I don 't believe she is doing him any harm. 
She just lets him talk out, and everybody else 
checks him up so. It was nice of her to come 
and talk with me, when we had all been keeping 
away from her. Perhaps he sent her, though. She 
says they have always been such good friends be 
cause she wouldn 't be anything else from the be 
ginning." 

" I don 't see why she need have told you that." 
" Oh, it was just to show he was run after. I 
wonder if he thinks we are running after him? 
Momma, I am tired of him! I wish he wouldn 't 
speak to me any more." 

"Why! do you really dislike him, Ellen?" 
"No, not dislike him. But it tires me to have 
him trying to amuse me. Don 't you understand ?" 

Mrs. Kenton said yes, she understood, but she 
was clear only of the fact that Ellen seemed flushed 
and weak at that moment. She believed that it was 
Miss Kasmith and not Mr. Breckon who was to 
blame, but she said : " Well, you needn 't worry about 
it long. It will only be a day or two now till we 
get to Boulogne, and then he will leave us. Hadn 't 
you better go down now, and rest awhile in your 
berth? I will bring your things."
