"Did you miss me so much? I am afraid of being 
a trouble sometimes," she returned with a delicate eva 
sion that I noticed. 

"Well, you needn't be; that's some of your father's 
notions. An' a girl without a mother needs a lot of 
training, though I must say you do pick up things 
mighty easy. Oh, boys, don't eat her up jes' if you 
hadn't had a dinner." 

"If you poured some milk over her you could eat 
her up," said Chris, laughing, "an' some sugar on top 
of her head." 

"Think of the sticky mess in my hair!" 

"Oh, but you'd jes' dissolve an' be like " rolling his 
eyes about to assist his brain in capturing a compari 
son "like a lovely pudding." 

"What an idea !" and Ben made a wry face. 

"Bring out a stool," said mother. "So M'liss Hatch 
comes now. Is she good for anything?" 

"Yes, I like her ever so much. Aunt Becky grew 
very cross and she and father had some words, and 
M'liss likes to show me about things. We have real 
good times when I'm home from school." 

Mother nodded. "She goes home at night?" 

"Yes." 

"She's got a beau. Pa'son Walker's Visin' young 



 

people to marry, an' it does smart up the young fel 
lows and keep them out of taverns. An' then they get 
thinking 'bout a house. Well, you jes' make the most 
out of M'liss. Is your father's garden turning out 
much? We've had quite a dry spell." 

"Father had it all wet one day. Yes, it is in good 
order. I hope next year we'll have ever so many 
berries." 

"Chicago won't ever be the garden of the Lord, but 
Adam an' Eve were turned out of that. Even a 
thistle wouldn't grow here unless you planted and 
watered it. What people ever see in this place to come 
an' settle passes me ; an' ther's so many splendid places 
in the world where things grow fairly wild. I don't 
wonder people sell out an' go away." 

"We're going to be a big port sometime," I an 
nounced. 

"Sho, that's the men's talk. I've heard men talk 
before. Where's all the people comin' from, I'd like 
to know? To hear em brag sometimes you'd think 
they'd be crossin' the Rocky Mountains 'cause there 
wasn't any room on this side!" 

Mother threw back her head and laughed. 

Father was walking up the path and then she de 
clared she must get supper. 

"Oh, let me put on the dishes," and Ruth rose, hang 
ing her bonnet carefully on a wooden peg. 

Father greeted her cordially and said it had been a 
full month since he set eyes on her. We all filed in 
doors, even to the big tiger cat, who kept following 
Ruth about wistfully. The boys never tormented him 





when Ruth was around. They came to the table with 
cleaner hands, and were much more mannerly, I 
noticed. 

We had a rather jolly meal even if it was Sunday. 
Afterward we sung some hymns. Mother was very 
fond of them. Then I walked home with Ruth, 
though Ben glanced at us large-eyed and wistful. 

"Were you very very much affronted?" I asked, 
as we were nearing her house. 

She seemed considering. 

"Because," in a hurried voice, as if I wasn't quite 
sure I was right "I've thought it over. I'd just as 
leave be a Whig as not." 

"I shouldn't like you to quarrel with father." 

"I'm not going to," I protested earnestly. "And I 
want to be good friends." 

"Oh, I want us always to be good friends," and the 
strong sweetness of her tone enraptured me. 

She held out her hand, and so we renewed our 
friendship. 



CHAPTER V 

OF COMMON DAILY THINGS 

THE picnic was a grand event, a new sort of entertain 
ment. Some distance to the southeast was the nearest 
real woods about us. Here and there would be a belt 
of scrubby pines, good for little besides firewood, or 
a group of cottonwood trees. But this might justly 
be called a forest. 

Tree planting had aroused no especial interest ex 
cept the fruit and shade trees in some of the newer 
residences. A wide clearing was considered a greater 
protection in the earlier days, as one could sight roving 
bands of Indians when there was nothing to shelter 
them. 

One would have thought from the discussions that 
the question of salvation was imperilled by this new 
form of dissipation. Still the day was carried for it, 
and some of the old people and most of the provision 
went out in great ox carts. But the children and 
young people did not mind walking and were full of 
spirit and eagerness. 

I managed to get off for half a day. Fortunately, 
the sun went under a cloud now and then, for which 
I was thankful as I hurried along. And when I came 



in sight I stood still a moment with a strange awe, 
touched by the beauty of the scene. The trees had 
grown up tall and straight, with no troublesome under 
brush. The branches made arches overhead and 
waved to and fro against the sky, that in most places 
had a background of faint gray, where darker clouds 
went drifting over it, or here and there parted to show 
a rift of blue. I did not know about dryads or wood 
nymphs in those days, but the figures flitting about 
gave me a curious unreal sense, as if they could 
scarcely be human beings. As I came nearer the 
hum of the voices and the swish of the two swings 
through a clear path, barely escaping the rugged tree 
boles or a drooping branch, mingled with the shout of 
some daring boy who twisted a little and escaped 
damage. 

There had been a fire built, and the uprights with 
the crotch were standing but the crosspiece had 
caught the blaze at last and fallen except at one end. 
A heap of ashes, and charred sticks lying about the 
edge looked rather melancholy, yet I had seen the like 
many a time when a band of roving Indians, tired with 
a long journey, had stopped to cook a meal. There 
were groups of women together, some of them with 
babies, and others with their knitting, while they sang 
the hymns most in vogue at that day. One haunts me 
through all this lapse of time: 

"Am I a soldier of the Cross, 

A follower of the Lamb, 
And shall I blush to own His cause
