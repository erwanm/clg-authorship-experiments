the gracious and deceitful earth only 
smiles the more, and makes his home an 
outer paradise, so that the thoughtless 
onlooker is glad for him, and fancies 
the poetic content of days spent in his 
picturesque (and mildewed) thatched cot- 
tage. But here the harder phases of 
living make themselves rudely apparent, 
and who can doubt that George Eliot 
read from them her first gospel of the 
trouble of life ? 

Now, John, our driver that day, a 
most serious man who talked as if he 
might have been an intimate acquaint- 
 

ance of the Great Lexicographer, was 
impressed with a wholesome fear of Mr. 
Isaac Evans, George Eliot's brother. 
According to him, this gentleman had 
suffered much from the settling of 
tourists upon his roof-tree, very like 
the plagues of ancient Egypt ; and we 
could imagine that he had threatened 
our conscientious John with dire ven- 
geance, should he ever bring such har- 
pies that way again. "All hail to thee 
for a sensible man, O brother of the 
great ! " we ejaculated mentally. " Not 
for worlds would we invade thy peace ! " 

"You can walk inside the grounds," 
said John, drawing up before Griff 
House. "He won't mind that. But 
please, miss, don't go into the house ! " 

Go into the house, like a monster 
made out of Paul Pry and Peeping Tom ! 
Though American, we were not of that 
mould, and it was only after repeated 
urgings from the box that we alighted, 
and like cats in a cream-rich pantry, 
took a few cautious steps into the trim 
door-yard in front of the comfortable 
brick house. And there temptation laid 
for our feet its first cobweb snare. A 
woman, a very decent serving-woman, 
 

came walking down the path, and to 
her we weakly apologized for our pres- 
ence, adding that we were from over-sea, 
and that we could not resist looking upon 
the spot where George Eliot was bom. 

"She wasn't bom here," said this 
sympathetic and kindly soul, "she was 
bom at Arbury Farm, though she did 
live here for many years." 

This was a blow. We had wasted our 
emotions, we had wept and applauded 
in the wrong place, and after a further 
exchange of civilities we returned to the 
carriage and taxed John with having 
made a mistake. (For, to our shame 
be it confessed, Baedeker had that day 
been left behind, and memory proved 
but a yielding staff.) And thereupon 
he waxed so emphatic, declaring that 
everybody knew Griff House to be the 
birthplace of Mary Ann Evans, and. 
moreover, he looked so like a local 
oracle, destined to develop into an Old- 
est Inhabitant, that we knew not what 
to think, and, perplexed and depressed, 
drove on to Chilvers Coton, the Shep- 
perton of the " Scenes from Clerical 
Life." 

Chilvers Coton, a suburb of dull, 
 

workaday Nuneaton, is not a place to 
invite the eye. It is, indeed, "a flat, 
ugly district . . . depressing enough to 
look at even on the brightest days," 
and the little commonplace church is 
close neighbor to a crowded yard of 
" the happy dead people." The building 
was locked, and thereupon we besieged 
the comfortable, old-fashioned vicarage, 
to ask for the key. A trim, rosy maid 
appeared at the door, and took the 
words from our mouths. "The key, 
miss.? Yes, miss. And perhaps you 
wish to see Milly's grave!" So in a 
half-dream we entered the little homely 
structure, and walked into the very pew 
where Mary Ann Evans used to sit, in 
those years when, as she confesses, 
" my nurse found it necessary to provide 
for the reenforcement of my devotional 
patience, by smuggling bread and butter 
into the sacred edifice." The improve- 
ments she once deplored as having 
marred the picture retained by her 
childish memory have yet left the 
church very quaint and characteristic ; 
the pews are old-fashioned, the gal- 
leries delightful. It is easy to feel in 
that atmosphere as if one were within 
 

a very few layers of the heart of 
country life. Then out into the church- 
yard again, where, surrounded by a 
high railing and weighted with a heavy 
tombstone, lies the grave of Emma 
Gwyther, who died at thirty-four, and 
whose sad fortunes were mirrored in 
those of Milly Barton. We left the spot, 
touched and saddened, as one who has 
looked on some most sacred relic of the 
past; wherever Mary Ann Evans was 
bom, we had at least read here one 
chapter of her thoughtful, image-storing 
childhood. Thereupon, like a persistent 
insect, came buzzing back the forgotten 
question, "Marry, where vfdiS she born?" 
Not that it made any difference, since 
she once walked among us, but that the 
spirit of investigation forbade inglori- 
ous defeat. And then it was that a 
new version of Launcelot Gobbo's im- 
mortal dialogue between conscience and 
the fiend was again enacted, and with 
the world-old result. " Run ! '' cried the 
fiend in conclusion, and we said to our 
driver, " Back to Griff House ! " set 
our lips and abided the event. I think 
John must have suspected us of contem- 
plating some deed of darkness, for he 


was in his turn resolute of countenance, 
as if, should Mr. Evans charge upon the 
besiegers, he had made up his mind to 
fly, hot-foot, to Coventry, leaving us in 
the lurch. But prudence had been quite 
abandoned with decorum, and walking 
up to the teeth of the enemy, we 
knocked for admittance at the door of 
GrifE House. Then appeared again the 
decent serving - woman, and we threw 
ourselves on her mercy. We were tossed 
about by winds of doctrine; would she 
tell us her grounds for saying that Mary 
Ann Evans was not born here ? She 
smiled, as if it made very little differ- 
ence, and yet indulgently, as one might 
over the vagaries of uneasy Americans, 
inclined to spend their nervous energy 
in fighting windmills and hunting lions, 
and repeated her tale. But in the midst 
of it she stopped to listen, evidently to 
a call from within, and, after a word of 
apology, hastened up the stairs. She 
was soon back again, this time bearing 
a message. " Miss Evans says you may 
walk in the garden, miss, if you like." 
(Poor Miss Evans ! should we take this 
as the spontaneous impulse of a kindly 
heart, or was it a sop thrown to im- 


known barbarians, whom she expected 
presently in her bed-chamber?) At 
all events, we stayed not to question
