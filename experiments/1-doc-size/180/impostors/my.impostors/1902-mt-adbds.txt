intelligence — shall we say light-witted, 
or perhaps approaching that? How 
do we know this? Because a person 
of sound intelligence would not have 
proposed to rob the man Buckner, 
who never had much money with him. 
But the assassin might have been a 
stranger? Let the bag speak again. 
I take from it this article. It is a bit 
of silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. 
Examine it, please — you — and 
you — and you. Now pass it back, 
please. There is but one lode on this 
coast which produces just that char- 
acter and color of quartz; and that is 
a lode which crops out for nearly two 
miles on a stretch, and in my opinion 
is destined, at no distant day, to con- 
fer upon its locality a globe-girdling 
celebrity, and upon its two hundred 
owners riches beyond the dreams of 
avarice. Name that lode, please.'' 

"The Consolidated Christian Sci- 
ence and Mary AnnT' was the prompt 
response. 

A wild crash of hurrahs followed, 
and every man reached for his neigh- 
bor's hand and wrung it, with tears 
in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Fergu- 
son shouted, "The Straight Flush is 
on the lode, and up she goes to a hun- 
dred and fifty a foot — you hear me I" 

When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed : 

'' We perceive, then, that three facts 
are established, to wit: the assassin 
was approximately light - witted ; he 
was not a stranger; his motive was 
robbery, not revenge. Let us pro- 
ceed. I hold in my hand a small frag- 
ment of fuse, with the recent smell of 
fire upon it. What is its testimony? 
Taken with the corroborative evidence 
of the quartz, it reveals to us that the 
assassin was a miner. What does it 
tell us further? This, gentlemen : that 
the assassination was consummated 
by means of an explosive. What 
else does it say? This: that the explosive
was located against the side 
of the cabin nearest the road — the 
front side — for within six feet of that 
spot I found it. 

" I hold in my fingers a burnt Swed- 
ish match — the kind one rubs on a 
safety-box. I found it in the road, 
622 feet from the abolished cabin. 
What does it say? This: that the 
train was fired from that point. What 
further does it tell us? This: that 
the assassin was left-handed. How 
do I know this? I should not be able 
to explain to you, gentlemen, how I 
know it, the signs being so subtle "uferte 

signs 

that only long experience and deep 
study can enable one to detect them. 
But the signs are here, and they are 
re-enforced by a fact which you must 
have often noticed in the great detec- 
tive narratives — that all assassins are 
left-handed." 

"By Jackson, that's so!'' said Ham 
Sandwich, bringing his great hand 
down with a resounding slap upon 
his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought 
of it before." 

"Nor II" "Nor I!" cried several. 
" Oh, there can't anything escape him 
— look at his eye!" 

"Gentlemen, distant as the mur- 
derer was from his doomed victim, he 
did not wholly escape injury. This 
fragment of wood which I now ex- 
hibit to you struck him. It drew 
blood. Wherever he is, he bears the 
telltale mark. I picked it up where 
he stood when he fired the fatal train." 

He looked out over the house from 
his high perch, and his countenance 
began to darken; he slowly raised 
his hand, and pointed — 
"There stands the assassin !"

For a moment the house was para- criminal 
lyzed with amazement ; then twenty 
voices burst out with: 

"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, Ml, not
Him? It's pure foolishness !" 

" Take care, gentlemen — be not 
hasty. Observe — he has the blood- 
mark on his brow' 

Hillyer turned white with fright. 
He was near to crying. He turned 
this way and that, appealing to every 
face for help and sympathy ; and held 
out his supplicating hands toward 
Holmes and began to plead: 



"Don oh, don't! I never did it; 
I give my word I never did it. The 
way I got this hurt on my forehead 
was — " 

"Arrest him, constable I" cried 
Holmes. "I will swear out the war- 
rant." 

The constable moved reluctantly for- 
ward — hesitated — stopped. 

Hillyer broke out with another ap- 
peal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do 
it; it would kill mother! You know 
how I got the hurt. Tell them, and 
to the rescue save me, Archy; save me!'' 

Stillman worked his way to the 
front, and said : 

"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be 
afraid." Then he said to the house, 
" Never mind how he got the hurt ; it 
hasn't anything to do with this case, 
and isn't of any consequence' 

"God bless you, Archy, for a true 
friend!" 

"HuiTah for Archyl Go in, boy, 
and play 'em a knock-down flush to 
their two pair 'n' a jack!" shouted 
the house, pride in their home talent 
and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty 
to it rising suddenly in the public 
heart and changing the whole atti- 
tude of the situation. 

Young Stillman waited for the noise 
to cease ; then he said, 

"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand 
by that door yonder, and Constable 
Harris to stand by the other one here, 
and not let anybody leave the room." 

" Said and done. Go on, old man!" 

"The criminal is present, I believe. 
I will show him to you before long, 
in case I am right in my guess. Now 
I will tell you all about the tragedy, 
from start to finish. The motive 
wasn't robbery ; it was revenge. The 
murderer wasn't light - witted. He
