" Veil, it be so tired, and goed up by de Park 
with Dick Loosing and dem oder girls." 

" Don't you think it better, Father Damon," Dr. 
Leigh interposed, "that Gretchen should have fresh 
air and some recreation on Sunday ?" 

" Und such bootiful tings by de Museum," added 
the mother. 

" Perhaps," said he, with something like a frown 
on his face, and then changed the subject to the 







sick child He did not care to argue the matter 
when Dr. Leigh was present, but he resolved to 
come again and explain to the mother that her 
daughter needed some restraining power other than 
her own impulse, and that without religious guid- 
ance she was pretty certain to drift into frivolous 
and vulgar if not positively bad ways. The father 
was a free-thinker ; but Father Damon thought he 
had some hold on the mother, who was of the 
Lutheran communion, but had followed her hus- 
band so far as to become indifferent to anything 
but their daily struggle for life. Yet she had a 
mother's instinct about the danger to her daughter, 
and had been pleased to have her go to Father 
Damon's chapel. 

And, besides, he could not bring himself in that 
presence to seem to rebuke Ruth Leigh. Was she 
not practically doing what his Lord did going 
about healing the sick, sympathizing with the poor 
and the discouraged, taking upon herself the bur- 
den of the disconsolate, literally, without thought 
of self, sharing, as it were, the misery and sin of 
this awful city ? And to-day, for the first time, he 
seemed to have seen the woman in her or was it 
the saint ? and he recalled that wonderful illumi- 
nation of her plain face that made her actually 
beautiful as she looked up from the little waif of 
humanity she held in her arms. It had startled 
him, and struck a new chord in his heart, and 





planted a new pang there that she had no belief 
in a future life. 

It did not occur to him that the sudden joy in 
her face might have been evoked by seeing him, 
for it was a long time since she had seen him. 
Nor did he think that the pang at his heart had 
another cause than religious anxiety. Ah, priest 
and worldly saint, how subtle and enduring are 
the primal instincts of human nature ! 

" Yes," he said, as they walked away, in reply to 
her inquiry as to his absence, " I have been in re- 
treat a couple of weeks." 

" I suppose," she said, softly, " you needed the 
rest, though," and she looked at him professionally; 
" if you will allow me to say it, it seems to me that 
you have not rested enough." 

" I needed strength " and it was the priest that 
spoke " in meditation and prayer to draw upon 
resources not my own." 

"And in fasting, too, I dare say," she added, with 
a little smile. 

" And why not ?" he asked. 

" Pardon me," she said ; " I don't pretend to know 
what you need. I need to eat, though Heaven 
knows it's hard enough to keep up an appetite 
down here. But it is physical endurance you need 
for the work here. Do you think fasting strength- 
ens you to go through your work night and day ?" 

" I know I couldn't do it on my own strength." 







And Dr. Leigh recalled times when she had seen 
him officiating in the chapel apparently sustained 
by nothing but zeal and pure spirit, and wondered 
that he did not faint and fall. And faint and fall 
he did, she was sure, when the service was over. 

" Well, it may be necessary to you, but not as an 
example to these people. I see enough involuntary 
fasting." 

" We look at these people from different points 
of view, I fear." And after a moment he said : 
" But, doctor, I wanted to ask you about Gretchen. 
You see her ?" 

" Occasionally. She works too many hours, but 
she seems to be getting on very well, and brings 
her mother all she earns." 

"Do you think she is able to stand alone?" 

Dr. Leigh winced a little at this searching ques- 
tion, for no one knew better than she the vulgariz- 
ing influence of street life and chance associations 
upon a young girl, and the temptations. She was 
even forced to admit the value in the way of re- 
straint, as a sort of police force, of the church and 
priestly influence, especially upon girls at the sus- 
ceptible age. But she knew that Father Damon 
meant something more than this, and so she an- 
swered : 

" But people have got to stand alone. She might 
as well begin." 

" But she is so young." 





" Yes, I know. She is in the way of temptation, 
but so long as she works industriously, and loves 
her mother, and feels the obligation, which the 
poor very easily feel, of doing her share for the 
family, she is not in so much moral danger as other 
girls of her age who lead idle and self-indulgent 
lives. The working-girls of the city learn to pro- 
tect themselves." 

" And you think this is enough, without any sort 
of religion that this East Side can go on without 
any spiritual life ?" 

Ruth Leigh made a gesture of impatience. In 
view of the actual struggle for existence she saw 
around her. this talk seemed like cant. And she 
said : " I don't know that anything can go on. 
Let me ask you a question, Father Damon. Do 
you think there is any more spirituality, any more 
of the essentials of what you call Christianity, in 
the society of the other side than there is on the 
East Side ?" 

" It is a deep question, this of spirituality," re- 
plied Father Damon, who was in the depths of his 
proselyting action a democrat and in sympathy 
with the people, and rated quite at its full value 
the conventional fashion in religion. " I shouldn't 
like to judge, but there is a great body of Christian 
men and women in this city who are doing noble 
work." 

" Yes," replied the little doctor, bitterly, "trying to 





save themselves. How many are trying to save others 
others except the distant and foreign sinners?"
