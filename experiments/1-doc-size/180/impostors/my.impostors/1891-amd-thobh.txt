this feeling of supervision. Was it something Miss Hil- 
liard suggested, something she divined herself, or one of 
those intangible presentiments ? 

" If you really consider it worth while, come then," 
Jasper says, veiling his annoyance by a gay indifference. 
" We have been going over an exercise for two violins ; per- 
haps that will not be so bad. We will have some respect 
for your nerves as well; but," pointedly, "a real lesson 
is best given alone — especially if I want to scold my 
pupil." 

Then he takes Perdita's arm caressingly just for a mo- 
ment, and stretches out his hand for her case. She walks 
on in silence, he and Cynthia keeping up a fragmentary 
conversation that really dies out before they reach their 
destination, a small, level space, shaded by an encircling 
group of trees. Jasper finds a seat for Cynthia, a little 
out of range. 

The elder is not especially entertained by the tuning and 
scraping which is prolonged needlessly, until Perdita's 
eyes .are alight with amusement. Cynthia's thoughts go 
off presently to the grim, unlovely town, to the three who 
have opened a new world to her by their pregnant, stirring 
topics. That the duet is not a success, she hardly notes ; 
her mind seems stirred by vjigue struggles, the intention 
of which eludes her, as if she were not at all sure of her 
own wants. Influences that she cannot understand toss 
her about like a restless sea. She seems such a poor, use- 
less thing to herself, with no strong characteristics. Per- 
dita may become a musician, Regina rule, a society queen 
in some small, select kingdom. When she is tired of this 
lounging, butterfly life, these odds and ends one picks 
up on the social shore, what then ? No wonder Miss 
llilliard is so busy and happy : there are demands and 
purposes to her life. 



 

The soft snmmer wind mingles its melody with the 
violins at their sweetest ; the birds warble accompani- 
ments. Filmy blue-green shadows dance about as if roused 
and stirred to intenser motion. The dusky hollows have 
t'Hiches of weird suggestiveness, the air is sweet with pun- 
gent, woody odors. They pass her unheeded, but they stir 
every pulse in Perdita's small body. She and Jasper smile 
across the bars of music. It is not so bad after all, only 
it establishes an uncomfortable precedent ; she suggests 
this to Jasper. 

" As if we could not find ways to outwit her." Jasper 
laughs softly. " Come," he says after a moment, " let us 
run away." 

A dancing light floods Perdita's brown eyes ; she softly 
puts up her violin. They take one of the narrow paths 
and hurry along. It is almost as if they were entering an 
unknown world ; the very trees have a weird look, the 
shade grows more dense, the cedars give out a damp fragrance. 
So they go rambling on and on. 

Cynthia starts suddenly from her unprofitable day-dream, 
find is vexed at the defection of the others. She walks 
slowly back to the house. Martha, the reigning spirit of 
the kitchen, is singing a doleful tune, as she prepares the 
vegetables for dinner ; her mother and Mr. Bradley are at 
one of their interminable discussions ; so she goes up-stairs. 
Kegina has risen and is sitting by the open window, lan- 
guidly brushing out her soft, dark hair, that falls over her 
white dressing-sack like a cloud tossed about by the wind. 

" Is your head better ? " asks Cynthia. 

" Oh, yes ; I did get very tired yesterday, and we were 
so late coming home : but the row in the moonlight was 
worth it all. Where is Perdita? I have not seen her 
this morning, nor heard her either." 

" She and Jasper have gone off with their violins. I 
went up the hill with them but presently they disappeared. 
Are they out much together ? " 

" I don'f know," uncertainly : "no, I think not. I sup- 
posed Perdita's craze would die out, and that Jasper would 





lose patience. Whatever else nature may have designed 
him for, his forte is not music-teaohing ; the whim answers 
for an entertainment through vacation." 

" But — do you suppose " — and Cynthia halts lamely. 

" Do I suppose what ? " with a little sharpness. Eegina 
is not fond of ambiguities. 

" Is it best that they should be so much together ? Per- 
dita has some queer strands in her nature. And, Regina ! 
don't you remember her old fancy of being a singer or 
going on the stage ? " 

Cynthia glances up rather startled at her own chimera. 

" Hosts of school-girls have dreamed that, and ended by 
going to a theatre two or three times a year," Eegina says 
with a touch of contempt. " If you think it possible, don't 
suggest it to her excitable brain." 

" I didn't really mean that ; but suppose she should get 
fond of — Jasper ? " Cynthia asks with trepidation. 

Regina is startled, then considers as she brushes the 
abundant lengths of hair. 

" It wouldn't be a bad match," she responds with delicate 
deliberation. " Only — Jasper is extremely fond of beauty, 
and poor Perdita doesn't make any great showing in that 
line at present. She is dainty, wilful, and piquant, and 
would entertain certain kinds of men continually. She 
pleases Jasper, but whether " — 

" Whether Jasper would make a good husband ? I have 
my doubts," says Cynthia, with assurance of youth, largely 
intuitive. 

" Husbands are a good deal what their wives make them," 
returns this fair philosopher. " Jasper has many pleasing 
qualities." 

" Whether they are fine and noble and honorable is of 
the greater import." 

Regina studies her sister a moment. "That sounds a 
little pedantic, like Miss Hilliard," she says with an irri- 
tating half-smile. "We have-not found anything ignoble 
in him yet, so far as I am aware, or dishonorable," with a 
curious emphasis that calls the color to Cynthia's cheek as 



 

she remembers some talks about Winterburne. "And if 
he really loved Perdita, I can't see any special objection 
to it ; but I should not want the poor child entangled in 
any such discomfort as a one-sided fancy. Cynthia, you 
have a little common-sense." 

" Really ? " Cynthia gives an amusingly significant 
smile. 

" Yes, we must consider." An inscrutable gravity set- 
tles over her face. Is she quite certain of her own con- 
clusions ? It would be monstrous to put Perdita between 
herself and some fine annoyances. But if Jasper really 
came to love her ! There is the bond of music between 
them. She has a curiously dissatisfied feeling concerning 
Jasper, as if she might have idealized the possible noble- 
ness in him : his devotion to his father, his graceful 
tenderness to her mother, so free from effusiveness, the 
bright, cheerful, dazzling atmosphere he made in the old 
house. Every way she has contrasted him with Winter- 
burne to the latter's disfavor. But she has to admit that 
Winterburne has a steady motive to life which he means to 
pursue unflinchingly ; not even love will turn him aside. 
Jasper has no motive save personal enjoyment. The thing 
that pleases him is right, the others are matters of indiffer- 
ence : he can argue them into positive wrongs and injuries. 
At first she fancied him largely dominated by frankness 
and simplicity ; she has a vague suspicion now that the 
admirable points in his character are a mere simulation of 
these. Is she so sure of her own penetration and judg- 
ment ? And if she cannot quite approve, will it be right 
to thrust Perdita into danger ? She is too naturally sin- 
cere to blind herself by any specious arguments. The
