both agreed about his virtues, and how benevolent 
he was. Mrs. Firth was glad to hear how gener- 
ous he had been to the Rosses. Then it wasn’t 
such a wonderful thing that he should befriend 
them. 

“ I suspect he wasn’t very happy in his married 
life. From what I can gather I think his wife 
was one of the driving, saving folks, and lived 
in a kind of penurious manner. And now he has 
such a splendid home, and Mrs. Alden, have you 
seen her? ” 

Oh, no, I haven’t been over to the house. 
Some of the children have. Marigold thinks it 
even ahead of the parsonage, and it’s ever so much 
larger.” 

And now he ought to -have a nice wife who 
would study his happiness and who would pull 
the way he wants to and let him be generous 
when he feels so inclined. It’s such a pleasure 
to him. And I can’t help thinking, even hoping — 

it would be just the thing ” 

She looked intently at Mrs. Firth. The face 
had the sweet innocence of a child. 

What would ? ” she asked almost eagerly. 

If he would marry Mrs. Alden. She is a 
perfect housekeeper and she has such a sympa- 





thetic sort of nature and such a sweet temper. 
I’ve known her for years.” 

“ Oh, that would be splendid ! Why, little 
Tip cried in the night — he often wakes up fright- 
ened, and she came in and cuddled him up so, 
‘ just like you, mommy,’ Chan said, and soon 
hushed him to sleep. All of ’em liked her so much. 
And if he should take any poor, little orphan 
child out of an asylum as he once spoke of, she’d 
be as good as an own mother to him.” 

She wasn’t even thinking of saddling one of 
her own children upon him, Mrs. Ross could see 
that. However did the absurd idea come into 
her head that he might be attracted to Mrs. Firth? 

When he came in he was surprised to see how 
much she was improved by her new coat and hat. 
And she had a very curious and lovely feeling 
toward him, as if she had in some way surprised 
the secret of his life, something that was to make 
him very happy, and surely he deserved it. 

Then they went to the hospital, and he presented 
her to two of the doctors and the nurses, and 
heard such good accounts of Chandler. And 
Nurse Jane convoyed her to the ward and left her 
kneeling there by the cot with her boy’s arms 
about her neck. 

Of course they cried a little, but it was for 


 

pure joy, and then she took the chair by the cot, 
and laid aside her hat, and they began to talk. 
He wanted to know all that had happened, and 
laughed at some of the lugubrious predictions. 

“ Oh, won’t I surprise them all when I come 
home straight and don’t have to wabble! Of 
course I’ll have to be careful for a while, and I 
can’t skate any this winter, but then, I couldn’t 
last winter, and it wasn’t so awful hard. Why, 
you can do without a good many things if you 
put something else in their places.” 

Then she had to tell what Linn was studying, 
and about all she could remember was the geog- 
raphy of Japan and China. And Marigold looked 
after the chickens a good deal, and they had sold 
a barrel of winter pears and two barrels of apples, 
and had orders for all their quinces. Prim was 
finding big words and putting ridiculous stories to 
them, and Laurel still talked crooked words, and 
how she had started for Mr. Mann’s house to 
bring Chan back, and about the neighbors, even 
to Granny Keen, who was quite sure Chan would 
never come back alive. 

“ And I’ve never been sick nor had a bit of 
fever. Dr. Richards says I am the very best 
patient he ever had,” laughed Chan. 

And Jim Briggs is going to be married at 


 

Thanksgiving. Mrs. Briggs is always cleaning 
house, I do believe, and now she’s making her 
new rag carpet. Goldie and Prim are going to 
sew rags for her. She’s got two breadths yet to 
make. And they have a new baby at the War- 
ners’, and Katy Burnham’s been sick again, and 
old Mr. Cross is dead.” 

Dear, how many changes I’ll find when I get 
back. But it’ll be just grand to see me go walk- 
ing round on two good legs ! And did you make 
Rilla’s pretty new dress? ” 

Yes, and she had made Linn such a nice coat 
out of Aunt Kitty’s cloak, and Goldie had a new 
dress out of a plaid skirt that the girls at school 
thought was splendid. 

“ And you’ve got a nice new bonnet, mother. 
Oh, and a new coat ! ” 

She blushed. Yes, Mr. Mann insisted that I 
should have them. I s’pose he wanted the folks 
here to think your mother was some great things. 

And, Chan ” She blushed still deeper. “ I 

didn’t have the money, but he said when you were 
big enough to work you’d pay it back. And oh, 
Chan, I hope you will and all the cost here. You 
can’t pay back the pure goodness part, but the 
money ” 

'' Oh, yes. You’ll see. Linn and I will 


 

straighten up things. Why, mother, presently 
we’ll be grown-up men, and Linn is bound to make 
money some way. I wish he could be a doctor 
in a big city. And Rilla would make such a 
splendid nurse. Think of eight big sons and 
daughters ! But we’d like the twins to stay little.” 

'' Oh, Chan, I was so afraid something would 
happen to you.” 

She had her arms about his neck, and was 
kissing him fondly. 

Why, it wasn’t bad at all, momsey. They 
didn’t have to cut a bit. And the other day they 
brought in a little boy run over, with his leg all 
smashed, and they did have to cut it off. And 
another one caught in a machine, with his scalp 
partly torn off, and nurse said they fixed him up 
as good as new. It’s just wonderful! But they 
only had to screw me up in a vise,” and he laughed. 

I was a good deal afraid when Mr. Mann first 
talked about it. Don’t you know they always tell 
you it doesn’t hurt to have a tooth pulled and 
it just does. But now they put you in a lovely 
sleep and you don’t know anything about it.” 

“ I’m so glad,” she returned, “ and that you can 
get quite well. Oh, are you — is everybody sure? ” 
Yes. Why, I can feel it even if I am bound 
up tight and my leg stretched out. But you’re
