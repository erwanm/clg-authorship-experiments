house, divided, as the custom is, into suites of three rooms, or
rather two, one being a common room, and the other being subdivided
into two small, narrow chambers, lived Rose and Adeline Beaufort,
respectively nineteen and seventeen years of age, and their young
brother Harry, a boy of thirteen.

It is five o'clock in the afternoon when we look in upon them.

"Rose," said her sister, "you look very tired. Can't you leave off
for an hour and rest?"

Rose was bending over a vest which she was making. Her drooping
figure and the lines on her face bespoke fatigue, yet her fingers
swiftly plied the needle, and she seemed anxiously intent upon her
task.

She shook her head in answer to her sister's words.

"No, Addie," she said; "it won't do for me to stop. You know how
little I earn at the most. I can't make more than one vest in a day,
and I get but thirty-five cents apiece."

"I know it, Rose," replied Adeline, with a sigh; "it is a great deal
of work to do for that paltry sum. If I were able to help you we
might get along better, even at such wages. I feel that I am very
useless, and a burden on you and Harry."

"You mustn't think anything of the kind, Addie," said Rose, quickly,
looking affectionately at her sister. "You know you are not strong
enough to work."

"And so you have to work the harder, Rose."

"Never mind, Addie; I am strong, and I enjoy working for you."

"But still I am so useless."

"You chase us up, and we can work all the better."

"I earn nothing. I wonder if I shall always be so weak and useless?"

"No. Don't you remember the doctor said you would in all probability
outgrow your weakness and be as strong as I am? All that is needed
is patience."

"Ah, it is not so easy to be always patient--when I think, too, of
how differently we should have been situated if grandfather had
treated us justly."

A shadow came over the face of Rose.

"Yes; I don't like to think of that. Why should he have left all his
property to our cousin Philip and none to us?"

"But if Philip should die it would all be ours, so Mr. Codicil says."

"I don't want anything to happen to the poor boy."

"Nor I, Rose. But don't you think he might do something for us?"

"So he would, very probably, if he were left to himself; but
you know he is under the guardianship of that uncle of his,
Richard Grafton, who is said to be intensely selfish and wholly
unprincipled. He means to live as handsomely as he can at Philip's
expense."

"Did grandfather appoint him guardian?"

"I believe so. Richard Grafton is very artful, and he led
grandfather to believe him fitted to be an excellent guardian for
the boy."

"I suppose he is in Europe?"

"No; I heard from Mr. Codicil, yesterday, that he was in New York."

"Is Philip with him?"

"Yes. He was to take the boy to Mr. Codicil's office to-day. There
was a report some time since--I did not mention it to you for
fear of exciting you--that Philip was dead. Mr. Codicil wrote to
Mr. Grafton to make inquiry. In answer, he has come to New York,
bringing Philip with him. While the boy lives, he receives an
annual income of six thousand dollars for the boy's expenses, and
to compensate him for his guardianship. You see, therefore, that
Philip's death would make a great difference to him."

"And to us," sighed Adeline.

"Addie," said Rose, gravely, "don't allow yourself to wish for the
death of our young cousin. It would be wicked."

"I know it, Rose; but when I consider how hard you work, and how
confined Harry is as a cash-boy, I am strongly tempted."

"Then put away the temptation, and trust to a good Providence to
take good care of us. God will not fail us."

"I wish I had your faith, Rose," said her younger sister.

"So you would, Addie, if you had my strength," said Rose, in an
affectionate tone. "It is harder for you to be idle than for me to
work."

"You are right there, Rose. I only wish I could work. Do you know
where Philip and his guardian are staying?"

"Yes; Mr. Codicil told me they were staying at the Metropolitan
Hotel."

"Did you ever see Philip?"

"Not since he was a little boy. I would not know him."

"Do you suppose he knows anything about us?"

"Probably Mr. Grafton never mentions us. Yet he must know that he
has cousins living, but he may not know how hard we have to struggle
for a livelihood."

"I wish we could get a chance to speak to him. He might feel
disposed to help us."

"Probably his power is not great. He is only sixteen, and I presume
has little command of money."

"How do you think it would do for Harry to carry him a letter,
asking him to call upon us?"

"His guardian would intercept it."

"It might be delivered to him privately."

"There is something in what you say," returned Rose, thoughtfully.
"He is our cousin, and we are his only living relatives. It would
only be proper for him to call upon us."

"The sooner we communicate with him the better, then," said Adeline,
whose temperament was quick and impulsive. "Suppose I write a letter
and get Harry to carry it to the hotel when he comes home."

"As you please, Addie. I would write it, but I want to finish this
vest to-night."

"I will write it. I want to be of some little use."

She rose, and with languid step drew near the table. Procuring
writing materials, she penned a brief note, which she handed to
Rose, when completed, with the inquiry, "How will that do?"

Rose cast her eyes rapidly over the brief note, which read as
follows:

    "DEAR COUSIN PHILIP:--No doubt you are aware that you have
    three cousins in this city--my sister Rose, my brother
    Harry, who will hand you this note, and myself. We have not
    seen you for many years. Will it be too much to ask you to
    call on us? We are in humble quarters, but shall be glad to
    welcome you to our poor home.

    "Your cousin,

    "ADELINE BEAUFORT."

In a line below, the address was given.

"That will do very nicely, Addie," said Rose. "I am glad you did not
hint at our need of assistance."

"If he comes to see us, he can see that for himself. I hope
something may come of it," continued the younger sister.

"Don't count too much on it, or your disappointment will be the more
keen."

"Harry can carry it around after supper."

"Philip may be at supper."

"Then he can wait. I wish he would come home."
