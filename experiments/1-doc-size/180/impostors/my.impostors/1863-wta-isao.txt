doors, some to the barracks, some to the school rooms. It was
"off-time," and without much assistance from Mr. Gault, who attempted
to introduce him, he made the acquaintance of half the students in the
Institute. At nine o'clock the sound of the drum rolled through the
halls, and the boys all retired.




CHAPTER XI.

RICHARD GOES THROUGH THE DRILL, AND HAS A SET-TO IN THE GROVE.


Richard slept very well, and was attending to the business of sleeping
with great pertinacity, when the reveille sounded at six o'clock in the
morning. He did not feel much like getting up, and though the other
boys in Barrack B instantly jumped out of bed, he did not heed the
summons. It went against his grain to get up at the sound of a drum, or
of a bell; not that he cared to lie in bed any longer, but the
principle of the thing was utterly objectionable.

"Come, Grant," said the boy who occupied one of the beds next to him,
in a kind and friendly tone, "it's time to turn out."

"I suppose it is," yawned Richard, "but I'm not quite ready to get up
yet."

"Better get up at once. They call the roll to half past six. You are in
our company, you know."

"Suppose I don't get up--what then?"

"It will be all the worse for you."

"What will they do?"

"I don't know; but fellows don't like to be late at roll-call."

Richard concluded to get up, for he preferred to see a punishment
inflicted upon some one besides himself before he got into trouble.
Bailey--for this was the name of the boy next to him--told him what to
do, and where to go, till they made their appearance at the armory of
Company D, to which the recruit had been assigned. They were then sent
to the school room for an hour's study. Richard was examined to
ascertain his attainments, and placed in a class, and he was told to
prepare himself for the lessons of the day. There was no great hardship
in this, and as Richard's talents were of a high order, he had no
difficulty in performing the work assigned to him.

The breakfast call scattered the boys again, and they were soon
reassembled in the dining room. When they were seated, profound silence
reigned throughout the apartment. The principal, all the assistant
teachers, and every one else belonging to the establishment, were
present. The chaplain then read a short passage from the Scriptures,
which was followed by a prayer, the whole service occupying not more
than three or four minutes.

The breakfast consisted of coffee, beefsteak, potatoes, with cold bread
and butter. The new comer was perfectly satisfied with this fare, and
taking it as a sample of his living, he did not believe he should
starve.

"What next, Nevers?" asked Richard of the boy who sat next to him, and
who wore the designation of an orderly sergeant.

"Squad drill, my boy. We shall give you some now," replied Nevers. "We
begin to find out what a fellow is made of on drill."

There was a little spare time before the drill came on, and the new
student improved it by inquiring particularly into the nature of his
duties. Bailey was patient and communicative, and he obtained from him
all the information he wanted.

Again the drum rattled, and the boys made their way to the several
armories. The doors and windows were thrown open, and the drill
commenced. It was conducted by Mr. Gault, who was assisted by various
officers of the company.

"Nevers," said the assistant, "you may take Grant and instruct him in
the positions."

Richard glanced at the orderly sergeant to whom this command had been
given, and the look of satisfaction which Nevers put on did not please
him.

"This way, if you please, Grant," said the young orderly sergeant, as
he led the way to one corner of the armory.

"What are you going to do?" demanded the recruit.

"Give you the positions."

"Are you my teacher?"

"I am ordered to give you the positions," replied Nevers, chuckling
with a delight which the new comer could not understand.

"You want to find out what I am made of--don't you?" said Richard,
remembering what the other had said to him at breakfast.

"I always obey orders."

"Well, I think I should rather be instructed by the regular teachers."

"Very well; I will report to Mr. Gault."

"You needn't trouble yourself. If this is the custom, go ahead. I am
ready."

"Stand as I do, if you please--heels on the same line, feet turned out
equally, knees straight."

Richard observed all these instructions, and being a very tractable
scholar, he was soon master of the positions.

"Eyes--right!" continued Nevers, explaining the meaning of the order.
"Front."

There were three other boys, who had not yet been supplied with
uniforms, having come to the Institute a few days before. These also
were placed in Nevers's care, and he began to drill them in the
facings.

"Attention--squad," said the drill master, explaining what he meant,
and going through with the next movement. "Right--face."

Richard did not come to time, and the sergeant repeated his
instructions, and gave the order again; but it was done no better than
the first time.

"Move quicker, Grant. How long will it take you to turn on your left
heel? Now, try again. Right--face!"

The young gentleman from Woodville did not like the style of the drill
master's remarks. Though he had been scrupulously polite in all he had
said, up to the point of Richard's failure to obey the order with
promptness, there was something in his tone and manner that was very
offensive to him. Nevers seemed to feel that he was armed with
authority, and he intended to make the new comer feel it; but Richard
took his own time, and after they had tried half a dozen times, he
could not "right face" till after the others had completed the
movement.

"How long will it take you to turn on your heel, Grant?" said Nevers,
sharply, when his patience had been sorely tried.

"Till you speak a little more civilly," replied Richard, quietly.
"Perhaps not till you have found out what I am made of."

Nevers bit his lip at this reply. Perhaps he was conscious that he
ought not to have used the remark, or he might have reported the
contumacy of the recruit to the assistant in charge of the room.

"We will try again," continued Nevers. "Right--face."

The result was no better than before; for Richard was so offended at
the manner of the instructor that he determined not to obey.

"Well, Grant, you won't get round till the first day of January. You
are a perfect dough-head," said Nevers, the last remark being in a low
tone, though it was distinctly heard by the subject of it.

"All right," muttered Richard. "If you have found out what my head is
made of, I will show you, by and by, what my fist is made of."

"Ready when you are," replied Nevers, dropping his voice so that the
assistant teacher could not hear him. "Now, about--face;" and he
explained the movement, and went through with it himself.

Richard, having made up his mind what to do when the occasion offered,
did not deem it necessary to carry his resistance any farther at
present. Besides, he was very desirous of learning the drill, that he
might join the company. His "about face," therefore, was
unexceptionable.

"Very well, Grant," said the drill master, in a satirical tone, and
with a patronizing air.

"Your praise and your censure are all the same to me. Spare me both, if
