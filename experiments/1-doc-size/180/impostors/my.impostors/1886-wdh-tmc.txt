XIY. 

SEWELL chanced to open his door to go out just as 
Miss Vane put her hand on the bell-pull, the morning 
after she had dismissed Lemuel. The cheer of his 
Monday face died out at the unsmiling severity of 
hers ; but he contrived to ask her in, and said he 
would call Mrs. Sewell, if she would sit down in the 
reception-room a moment. 

"I don't know," she said, with a certain look of 
inquiry, not unmixed with compassion. "It 's about 
Lemuel." 

The minister fetched a deep sigh. " Yes, I know 
it. But she will have to know it sooner or later." 
He went to the stairway and called her name, and 
then returned to Miss Yane in the reception-room. 

" Has Lemuel been here ? " she asked. 

"No." 
 " You said you knew it was about him " 

" It was my bad conscience, I suppose, and your 
face that told me." 

Miss Yane waited for Mrs. Sewell 's presence before 
she unpacked her heart. Then she left nothing in it. 
She ended by saying, " I have examined and cross- 

 

examined Sibyl, but it 's like cross-questioning a 
chameleon ; she changed colour with every new light 
she was put into." Here Miss Yane had got sorrow 
fully back to something more of her wonted humour, 
and laughed. 

"Poor Sibyl I" said Mrs. Sewell. 

" Poor ? " retorted Miss Vane. " Not at all ! I 
could get nothing out of either of them ; but I feel 
perfectly sure that Lemuel was not to blame." 

" It 's very possible," suggested Mrs. Sewell, " that 
he did say something in his awkward way that she 
misconstrued into impertinence." 

Miss Vane did not seem to believe this. "If- 
Lemuel had given me the slightest satisfaction," she 
began in self-exculpation. " But no," she broke off. 
"It had to be!" She rose. "I thought I had 
better come and tell you at once, Mr. Sewell. I 
suppose you will want to look him up, and do some 
thing more for him. I wish if you find him you 
would make him take this note." She gave the 
minister a ten-dollar bill. " I tried to do so, but he 
would not have it. I don't know what I shall do 
without him ! He is the best and most faithful 
creature in the world. Even in this little time I had 
got to relying implicitly upon his sense, his judgment, 
his goodness, his Well ! good morning ! " 

She ran out of the door, and left Sewell confronted 
with his wife. 

He did not know whether she had left him to 
hope or to despair, and he waited for his wife to 
interpret his emotion, but Mrs. Sewell tacitly refused 



 

to do this. After a dreary interval he plucked a 
random cheerfulness out of space, and said : " Well, 
if Miss Vane feels in that way about it, I don't see 
why the whole affair can't be arranged and Barker 
reinstated." 

"David," returned his wife, not vehemently at all, 
"when you come out with those mannish ideas I 
don't know what to do." 

" Well, my dear," said the minister, " I should be 
glad to come out with some womanish ideas if I had 
them. I dare say they would be better. But I do 
my poor best, under the circumstances. What is 
the trouble with my ideas, except that the sex is 
wrong ? " 

" You think, you men," replied Mrs. Sewell, " that 
a thing like that can, be mended up and smoothed 
over, and made just the same as ever. You think 
that because Miss Vane is sorry she sent Barker 
away and wants him back, she can take him back." 

" I don't see why she can t. I've  sometimes 
supposed that the very highest purpose of Chris 
tianity was mutual forgiveness forbearance with 
one another 's errors/ 

" That 's all very well," said Mrs. Sewell. " But 
you know that whenever I have taken a cook back, 
after she had shown temper, it 's been an entire 
failure ; and this is a far worse case, because there is 
disappointed good- will mixed up with it. I don't 
suppose Barker is at all to blame. Whatever has 
happened, you may be perfectly sure that it has been 
partly a bit of stage-play in Sibyl and partly a 



 

mischievous desire to use her power over him. I fore 
saw that she would soon be tired of reforming him. 
But whatever it is, it 's something that you can't 
repair. Suppose Barker went back to them ; could 
they ignore what 's happened I " 

" Of course not," Sewell admitted. , 

" Well, and should he ask her pardon, or she his ?" 

" The Socratic method is irresistible," said the 
minister sadly. "You have proved that nothing 
can be done for Barker with the Yanes. And now 
the question is, what can be done for him ? " 

" That 's something I' must leave to you, David," 
said his wife dispiritedly. She arose, and as she 
passed out of the room she added, " You will have to 
find him, in the first place, and you had better go 
round to the police stations and the tramps lodging- 
houses and begin looking." 

Sewell sighed heavily under the sarcastic advice, 
but acted upon it, and set forth upon the useless 
quest, because he did not know in the least what else 
to do. 

All that week Barker lay, a lurking discomfort, in 
his soul, though as the days passed the burden grew 
undeniably lighter ; Sewell had a great many things 
besides Barker to think of. But when Sunday came, 
and he rose in his pulpit, he could not help casting a 
glance of guilty fear toward Miss Yane 's pew and 
drawing a long breath of guilty relief not to see 
Lemuel in it. We are so made, that in the reaction 
the minister was able to throw himself into the 
matter of his discourse with uncommon fervour. 



 OR, 

It was really very good matter, and he felt tho 
literary joy in it which flatters the author even of a 
happily worded supplication to the Deity. He let 
his eyes, freed from their bondage to Lemuel 's 
attentive face, roam at large in liberal ease over his 
whole congregation ; and when, toward the close of 
his sermon, one visage began to grow out upon 
him from the two or three hundred others, and 
to concentrate in itself the facial expression of all the 
rest, and become the only countenance there, it was 
a perceptible moment before he identified it as that 
of his inalienable charge. Then he began to preach 
at it as usual, but defiantly, and with yet a haste to 
be through and to get speech with it that he felt 
was ludicrous, and must appear unaccountable to his 
hearers. It seemed to him that he could not bring 
his sermon to a close ; he ended it in a cloudy burst 
of rhetoric which he feared would please the nervous, 
elderly ladies who sometimes blamed him for a 
want of emotionality and knew must grieve the 
judicious. While the choir was singing the closing 
hymn, he contrived to beckon the sexton to the pulpit,
