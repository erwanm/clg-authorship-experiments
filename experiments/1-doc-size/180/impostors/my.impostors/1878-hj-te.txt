" Oh sister, sister! " murmured Charlotte. 

" You have always needed advice," Mr. Went- 
worth declared. " You have had a difficult tem- 
perament." 



   

" Why do you call it difficult ? It might have 
been easy, if you had allowed it. You would n't 
let me be natural. I don't know what you wanted 
to make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst." 

Charlotte at last took hold of her sister. She 
laid her two hands upon Gertrude's arm. "He 
cares so much for you," she almost whispered. 

Gertrude looked at her intently an instant ; then 
kissed her. " No, he does not," she said. 

" I have never seen you so passionate," observed 
Mr. Wentworth, with an air of indignation miti- 
gated by high principles. 

" I am sorry if I offend you," said Gertrude. 

"You offend me, but I don't think you are 
sorry." 

" Yes, father, she is sorry," said Charlotte. 

"I would even go further, dear uncle," Felix 
interposed. " I would question whether she really 
offends you. How can she offend you ? " 

To this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate 
answer. Then, in a moment, " She has not 
profited as we hoped." 

" Profited ? Ah voild ! " Felix exclaimed. 

Gertrude was very pale; she stood looking 
down. " I have told Felix I would go away with 
him," she presently said. 

" Ah, you have said some admirable things ! " 
cried the young man. 



 

" Go away, sister ? " asked Charlotte. 

" Away away ; to some strange country." 

" That is to frighten you," said Felix, smiling 
at Charlotte. 

"To what do you call it?" asked Gertrude, 
turning an instant to Felix. " To Bohemia." 

" Do you propose to dispense with prelimina- 
ries ? " asked Mr. Went worth, getting up. 

" Dear uncle, vous plaisantez ! " cried Felix. 
" It seems to me that these are preliminaries." 

Gertrude turned to her father. "I have prof- 
ited," she said. " You wanted to form my char- 
acter. Well, my character is formed for my 
age. I know what I want; I have chosen. I 
am determined to marry this gentleman." 

" You had better consent, sir," said Felix very 
gently. 

" Yes, sir, you had better consent," added a 
very different voice. 

Charlotte gave a little jump, and the others 
turned to the direction from which it had come. 
It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped 
through the long window which stood open to the 
piazza. He stood patting his forehead with his 
pocket-handkerchief ; he was very much flushed ; 
his face wore a singular expression. 

" Yes, sir, you had better consent," Mr. Brand 
repeated, coming forward. " I know what Miss 
Gertrude means." 



   

" My dear friend ! " murmured Felix, laying his 
hand caressingly on the young minister's arm. 

Mr. Brand looked at him ; then at Mr. Went- 
worth ; lastly at Gertrude. He did not look at 
Charlotte. But Charlotte's earnest eyes were fast- 
ened to his own countenance ; they were asking 
an immense question of it. The answer to this 
question could not come all at once ; but some 
of the elements of it were there. It was one of 
the elements of it that Mr. Brand was very red, 
that he held his head very high, that he had a 
bright, excited eye and an air of embarrassed 
boldness the air of a man who has taken a re- 
solve, in the execution of which he apprehends the 
failure, not of his moral, but of his personal, re- 
sources. Charlotte thought he looked very grand ; 
and it is incontestable that Mr. Brand felt very 
grand. This, in fact, was the grandest moment 
of his life ; and it was natural that such a moment 
should contain opportunities of awkwardness for 
a large, stout, modest young man. 

" Come in, sir," said Mr. Went worth, with an 
angular wave of his hand. " It is very proper 
that you should be present." 

"I know what you are talking about," Mr, 
Brand rejoined. " I heard what your nephew 
said." 

" And he heard what you said I " exclaimed 
Felix, patting him again on the arm. 



 

"I am not sure that I understood," said Mr. 
Wentworth, who had angularity in his voice as 
well as in his gestures. 

Gertrude had been looking hard at her former 
suitor. She had been puzzled, like her sister ; but 
her imagination moved more quickly than Char- 
lotte's. " Mr. Brand asked you to let Felix take 
me away," she said to her father. 

The young minister gave her a strange look. 
" It is not because I don't want to see you any 
more," he declared, in a tone intended as it were 
for publicity. 

" I should n't think you would want to see me 
any more," Gertrude answered, gently. 

Mr. Wentworth stood staring. " Is n't this 
rather a change, sir ? " he inquired. 

" Yes, sir." And Mr. Brand looked anywhere ; 
only still not at Charlotte. " Yes, sir," he re- 
peated. And he held his handkerchief a few mo- 
ments to his lips. 

" Where are our moral grounds ? " demanded 
Mr. Wentworth, who had always thought Mr. 
Brand would be just the thing for a younger 
daughter with a peculiar temperament. 

" It is sometimes very moral to change, you 
know," suggested Felix. 

Charlotte had softly left her sister's side. She 
had edged gently toward her father, and now her 



   

hand found its way into his arm. Mr. Wentworth 
had folded up the "Advertiser" into a surpris- 
ingly small compass, and, holding the roll with one
