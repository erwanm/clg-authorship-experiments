COUNTRY IN THE YEARS l86l TO 1865 ” 

The grounds are nobly situated; being very high 
and commanding a wide prospect of land and river. 
They are tastefully laid out in broad terraces, with 
winding roads and paths ; and there is profuse adorn- 
ment in the way of semi-tropical shrubs and flowers ; 
and in one part is a piece of native wild-wood, left just 
as it grew, and, therefore, perfect in its charm. 
Everything about this cemetery suggests the hand of 
the national Government. The Government's work is 
always conspicuous for excellence, solidity, 
thoroughness, neatness. The Government does its work well in 
the first place, and then takes care of it. 

By winding roads — which were often cut to so great 
a depth between perpendicular walls that they were 
mere roofless tunnels — we drove out a mile or two and 
visited the monument which stands upon the scene of 
the surrender of Vicksburg to General Grant by 
General Pemberton. Its metal will preserve it from the 
hackings and drippings which so defaced its 
predecessor, which was of marble ; but the brick foundations 
are crumbling, and it will tumble down by and by. It 
overlooks a picturesque region of wooded hills and 
ravines; and is not unpicturesque itself, being well 
smothered in flowering weeds. The battered remnant 
of the marble monument has been removed to the 
National Cemetery. 

On the road, a quarter of a mile townward, an aged 
colored man showed us, with pride, an unexploded 
bombshell which had lain in his yard since the day it 
fell there during the siege. 

“I was a-stannin* heah, an* de dog was a-stannin* 
heah; de dog he went for de shell, gwine to pick a fuss 
wid it; but I didn’t; I says, 4 Jes’ make youseff at 
home heah; lay still whah you is, or bust up de place, 
jes’ as you’s a mind to, but Ts got business out in de 
woods,

Vicksburg is a town of substantial business streets 
and pleasant residences ; it commands the commerce of 
the Yazoo and Sunflower rivers; is pushing railways in 
several directions, through rich agricultural regions, and 
has a promising future of prosperity and importance. 

Apparently, nearly all the river towns, big and little, 
have made up their minds that they must look mainly 
to railroads for wealth and upbuilding, henceforth. 
They are acting upon this idea. The signs are that 
the next twenty years will bring about some noteworthy 
changes in the Valley, in the direction of increased 
population and wealth, and in the intellectual advance- 
ment and the liberalizing of opinion which go naturally 
with these. And yet, if one may judge by the past, 
the river towns will manage to find and use a chance, 
here and there, to cripple and retard their progress. 
They kept themselves back in the days of steamboating 
supremacy, by a system of wharfage dues so stupidly 
graded as to prohibit what may be called small retail 
traffic in freights and passengers. Boats were charged 
such heavy wharfage that they could not afford to land 
for one or two passengers or ,a light lot of freight. 
Instead of encouraging the bringing of trade to their 
doors, the towns diligently and effectively discouraged 
it. They could have had many boats and low rates ; 
but their policy rendered few boats and high rates 
compulsory. It was a policy which extended — and 
extends — from New Orleans to St. Paul. 

We had a strong desire to make a trip up the Yazoo 
and the Sunflower — an interesting region at any time, 
but additionally interesting at this time, because up 
there the great inundation was still to be seen in force 
— but we were nearly sure to have to wait a day or 
more for a New Orleans boat on return; so we were 
obliged to give up the project. 

Here is a story which I picked up on board the boat 
that night. I insert it in this place merely because it 
is a good story, not because it belongs here — for it 
doesn't. It was told by a passenger, — a college 
professor,— and was called to the surface in the course of 
a general conversation which began with talk about 
horses, drifted into talk about astronomy, then into 
talk about the lynching of the gamblers in Vicksburg 
half a century ago, then into talk about dreams and 
superstitions; and ended, after midnight, in a dispute 
over free trade and protection. . 



CHAPTER XXXVI. 

THE PROFESSOR’S YARN 

I T was 5n the early days. I was not a college pro- 
fessor then. I was a humble-minded young land- 
surveyor, with the world before me — to survey, in 
case anybody wanted it done. I had a contract to 
survey a route for a great mining ditch in California, 
and I was on my way thither, by sea — a three or four 
weeks’ voyage. There were a good many passengers, 
but I had very little to say to them; reading and 
dreaming were my passions, and I avoided conversa- 
tion in order to indulge these appetites. There were 
three professional gamblers on board — rough, repul- 
sive fellows. I never had any talk with them, yet I 
could not help seeing them with some frequency, foi 
they gambled in an upper-deck state-room every day 
and night, and in my promenades I often had glimpses 
of them through their door, which stood a little ajar to 
let out the surplus tobacco smoke and profanity. They 
were an evil and hateful presence, but I had to put up 
with it, of course. 

There was one other passenger who fell under my 
eye a good deal, for he seemed determined to be 
friendly with me, and I could not have gotten rid of 
him without running some chance of hurting his feel- 
ings, and I was far from wishing to do that. Besides, 
there was something engaging in his countrified 
simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first time I 
saw this Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes 
and his looks, that he was a grazier or farmer from the 
backwoods of some Western State, — doubtless Ohio, — 
and afterward, when he dropped into his personal 
history, and I discovered that he was a cattle-raiser 
from interior Ohio, I was so pleased with my own 
penetration that I warmed toward him for verifying my 
instinct. 

He got to dropping alongside me every day, after 
breakfast, to help me make my promenade; and so, in 
the course of time, his easy-working jaw had told me 
everything about his business, his prospects, his family, 
his relatives, his politics — in fact, everything that 
concerned a Backus, living or dead. And meantime I 
think he had managed to get out of me everything I 
knew about my trade, my tribe, my purposes, my 
prospects, and myself. He was a gentle and 
persuasive genius, and this thing showed it; for I was not 
given to talking about my matters. I said something 
about triangulation, once; the stately word pleased his 
ear; he inquired what it meant; I explained. After 
that he quietly and inoffensively ignored my name, and 
always called me Triangle. 

What an enthusiast he was in cattle ! At the bare 
name of a bull or a cow, his eye would light and his 
eloquent tongue would turn itself loose. As long as I 
would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he 
knew all breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them 
all with his affectionate tongue. I tramped along in 
voiceless misery while the cattle question was up. 
When I could endure it no longer, I used to deftly 
insert a scientific topic into the conversation ; then my 
eye fired and his faded ; my tongue fluttered, his 
stopped; life was a joy to me, and a sadness to him. 

One day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat 
of diffidence : 



“Triangle, would you mind coming down to my 
state-room a minute and have a little talk on a certain 
matter?” 

I went with him at once. Arrived there, he put his 
head out, glanced up and down the saloon warily, then 
closed the door and locked it. We sat down on the 
sofa and he said : 

“I’m a-going to make a little proposition to you, 
and if it strikes you favorable, it’ll be a middling good 
thing for both of us. You ain’t a-going out to Cali- 
forny for fun, nuther am I — it’s business , ain’t that
