Perhaps I'm one of them. And where am I ? 
Don't interrupt. I tell you it is a relief to come 
across a sweet, womanly ignoramus. "What 
church does she go to?" 

" Who ?" 

" That Mavick girl." 

" St. Thomas's, I believe." 

"That's good — that's devotional. I suppose 
you go there too, being brought up a Congrega- 
tionalist ?" 

" At vespers, sometimes. But, Celia, what is 
the matter with you ? I thought you didn't care 
— didn't care to belong to anything ?" 

" I ? I belong to everything. Didn't I write 
you reams about my studies in psychology ? I've 
come to one conclusion. There are only two per- 
sons in the world who stand on a solid founda- 
tion, the Roman Catholic and the Agnostic. The 
Roman Catholic knows everything, the Agnostic 
doesn't know anything." 

Philip was never certain when the girl was 
bantering him ; nor, when she was in earnest, 
how long she would remain in that mind and 
mood. So he ventured, humorously : 

" The truth is, Celia, that you know too much 
to be either. Tou are what they call emanci- 
pated." 

" Emancipated !" And Celia sat up energeti- 
cally, as if she were now really interested in 





r 
 

the conversation. " Become the slave of myself 
instead of the slave of somebody else ! That's 
the most hateful thing to be, emancipated. I 
never knew a woman who said she was emanci- 
pated who wasn't in some ridiculous folly or an- 
other. Now, Phil, I'm going to tell you some- 
thing. I can tell you. You know I've been 
striving to have a career, to get out of myself 
somehow, and have a career for myself. "Well, 
to-day — mind, I don't say to-morrow" — (and 
there was a queer little smile on her lips) — "I 
think I will just try to be good to people and 
things in general, in a human way." 

" And give up education ?" 

" No, no. I get my living by education, just 
as you do, or hope to do, by law or by letters ; 
it's all the same. But wait. I haven't finished 
what I was going to say. The more I go into 
psychology, trying to find out about my mind 
and mind generally, the more mysterious every- 
thing is. Do you know, Phil, that I am getting 
into the supernatural? You can't help running 
into it. For me, I am not side-tracked by any 
of the nonsense about magnetism and telepathy 
and mind-reading and other psychic impondera- 
bilities. Isn't it queer that the further we go 
into science the deeper we go into mystery ? 
Now, don't be shocked, I mean it reverently, just 
as an illustration. Do you think any one knows 




 

really anything more about the operation in the 
world of electricity than he does about the oper- 
ation of the Holy Ghost ? And yet people talk 
about science as if it were something they had 
made themselves." 

" But, Celia— " 

" ISTo, I've talked enough. We are in this world 
and not in some other, and I have to make my 
living. Let's go into the other room and see the 
old masters. They, at least, knew how to paint 
— to paint passion and character ; some of them 
could paint soul. And then, Phil, I shall be 
hungry. Talking about the mind always makes 
me hungry." 



CHAPTER XI 

Philip was always welcome at his uncle's house 
in Eivervale. It was, of course, his home during 
his college life, and since then he was always ex- 
pected for his yearly holiday. The women of the 
house made much of him, waited on him, deferred 
to him, petted him, with a flattering mingling of 
tenderness to a little boy and the respect due to 
a man who had gone into the world. Even Mr. 
Maitland condescended to a sort of equality in 
engaging Philip in conversation about the state 
of the country and the prospects of business in 
New York. 

It was July. When Philip went to sleep at 
night — he was in the front chamber reserved for 
guests — the loud murmur of the Deerfield was in 
his ears, like a current bearing him away into 
sweet sleep and dreams in a land of pleasant ad- 
ventures. Only in youth come such dreams. 
Later on the sophisticated mind, left to its own 
guidance in the night, wanders amid the com- 
plexities of life, calling up in confusion scenes 
long forgotten or repented of, images only regis- 




 

tered by a sub-conscious process, dreams to per- 
plex, irritate, and excite. 

In the morning the same continuous murmur 
seemed to awake him into a peaceful world. 
Through the open window came in the scents 
of summer, the freshness of a new day. How 
sweet and light was the air ! It was indeed the 
height of summer. The coi'n, not yet tasselled, 
stood in green flexible ranks, moved by the early 
breeze. In the river-meadows haying had just 
begun. Fields of timothy and clover, yellowing 
to ripeness, took on a fresh bloom from the dew, 
and there was an odor of new-mown grass from 
the sections where the scythes had been. He 
heard the call of the crow from the hill, the mel- 
ody of the bobolink along the meadow-brook ; 
indeed, the birds of all sorts were astir, skimming 
along the ground or rising to the sky, keeping 
watch especially over the garden and the fruit- 
trees, carrying food to their nests, or teaching 
their young broods to fly and to chirp the songs 
of summer. And from the wood-shed the shrill 
note of the scythe under the action of the grind- 
stone. No such vivid realization of summer as 
that. 

Philip stole out the unused front door without 

disturbing the family. Whither? Where would 

a boy be likely to go the first thing? To the 

barn, the great cavernous barn, its huge doors 





 

now wide open, the stalls vacant, the mows 
empty, the sunlight sifting in through the high 
shadowy spaces. How much his life had been 
in that barn ! How he had stifled and scrambled 
mowing hay in those lofts ! On the floor he had 
hulled heaps of corn, thrashed oats with a flail —
