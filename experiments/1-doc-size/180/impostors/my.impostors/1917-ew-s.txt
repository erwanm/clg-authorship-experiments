day. But you don’t live here, and you don’t know anything about any of
us, so what did you have to meddle for? Do you suppose the other girls’d
have kept the books any better’n I did? Why, Orma Fry don’t hardly know
a book from a flat-iron! And what if I don’t always sit round here
doing nothing till it strikes five up at the church? Who cares if the
library’s open or shut? Do you suppose anybody ever comes here for
books? What they’d like to come for is to meet the fellows they’re going
with if I’d let ‘em. But I wouldn’t let Bill Sollas from over the hill
hang round here waiting for the youngest Targatt girl, because I know
him... that’s all... even if I don’t know about books all I ought to....”

She stopped with a choking in her throat. Tremors of rage were running
through her, and she steadied herself against the edge of the desk lest
he should see her weakness.

What he saw seemed to affect him deeply, for he grew red under his
sunburn, and stammered out: “But, Miss Royall, I assure you... I assure
you....”

His distress inflamed her anger, and she regained her voice to fling
back: “If I was you I’d have the nerve to stick to what I said!”

The taunt seemed to restore his presence of mind. “I hope I should if I
knew; but I don’t. Apparently something disagreeable has happened, for
which you think I’m to blame. But I don’t know what it is, because I’ve
been up on Eagle Ridge ever since the early morning.”

“I don’t know where you’ve been this morning, but I know you were here
in this library yesterday; and it was you that went home and told your
cousin the books were in bad shape, and brought her round to see how I’d
neglected them.”

Young Harney looked sincerely concerned. “Was that what you were told?
I don’t wonder you’re angry. The books are in bad shape, and as some are
interesting it’s a pity. I told Miss Hatchard they were suffering from
dampness and lack of air; and I brought her here to show her how easily
the place could be ventilated. I also told her you ought to have some
one to help you do the dusting and airing. If you were given a wrong
version of what I said I’m sorry; but I’m so fond of old books that
I’d rather see them made into a bonfire than left to moulder away like
these.”

Charity felt her sobs rising and tried to stifle them in words. “I don’t
care what you say you told her. All I know is she thinks it’s all my
fault, and I’m going to lose my job, and I wanted it more’n anyone in
the village, because I haven’t got anybody belonging to me, the way
other folks have. All I wanted was to put aside money enough to get away
from here sometime. D’you suppose if it hadn’t been for that I’d have
kept on sitting day after day in this old vault?”

Of this appeal her hearer took up only the last question. “It is an
old vault; but need it be? That’s the point. And it’s my putting the
question to my cousin that seems to have been the cause of the trouble.”
 His glance explored the melancholy penumbra of the long narrow room,
resting on the blotched walls, the discoloured rows of books, and the
stern rosewood desk surmounted by the portrait of the young Honorius.
“Of course it’s a bad job to do anything with a building jammed against
a hill like this ridiculous mausoleum: you couldn’t get a good draught
through it without blowing a hole in the mountain. But it can be
ventilated after a fashion, and the sun can be let in: I’ll show you
how if you like....” The architect’s passion for improvement had
already made him lose sight of her grievance, and he lifted his stick
instructively toward the cornice. But her silence seemed to tell him
that she took no interest in the ventilation of the library, and turning
back to her abruptly he held out both hands. “Look here--you don’t mean
what you said? You don’t really think I’d do anything to hurt you?”

A new note in his voice disarmed her: no one had ever spoken to her in
that tone.

“Oh, what DID you do it for then?” she wailed. He had her hands in
his, and she was feeling the smooth touch that she had imagined the day
before on the hillside.

He pressed her hands lightly and let them go. “Why, to make things
pleasanter for you here; and better for the books. I’m sorry if my
cousin twisted around what I said. She’s excitable, and she lives on
trifles: I ought to have remembered that. Don’t punish me by letting her
think you take her seriously.”

It was wonderful to hear him speak of Miss Hatchard as if she were a
querulous baby: in spite of his shyness he had the air of power that the
experience of cities probably gave. It was the fact of having lived
in Nettleton that made lawyer Royall, in spite of his infirmities, the
strongest man in North Dormer; and Charity was sure that this young man
had lived in bigger places than Nettleton.

She felt that if she kept up her denunciatory tone he would secretly
class her with Miss Hatchard; and the thought made her suddenly simple.

“It don’t matter to Miss Hatchard how I take her. Mr. Royall says she’s
going to get a trained librarian; and I’d sooner resign than have the
village say she sent me away.”

“Naturally you would. But I’m sure she doesn’t mean to send you away.
At any rate, won’t you give me the chance to find out first and let you
know? It will be time enough to resign if I’m mistaken.”

Her pride flamed into her cheeks at the suggestion of his intervening.
“I don’t want anybody should coax her to keep me if I don’t suit.”

He coloured too. “I give you my word I won’t do that. Only wait till
tomorrow, will you?” He looked straight into her eyes with his shy grey
glance. “You can trust me, you know--you really can.”

All the old frozen woes seemed to melt in her, and she murmured
awkwardly, looking away from him: “Oh, I’ll wait.”




V


There had never been such a June in Eagle County. Usually it was a month
of moods, with abrupt alternations of belated frost and mid-summer heat;
this year, day followed day in a sequence of temperate beauty. Every
morning a breeze blew steadily from the hills. Toward noon it built up
great canopies of white cloud that threw a cool shadow over fields and
woods; then before sunset the clouds dissolved again, and the western
light rained its unobstructed brightness on the valley.

On such an afternoon Charity Royall lay on a ridge above a sunlit
hollow, her face pressed to the earth and the warm currents of the grass
running through her. Directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch
laid its frail white flowers and blue-green leaves against the sky. Just
beyond, a tuft of sweet-fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the
grass, and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of
sunshine. This was all she saw; but she felt, above her and about her,
the strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge, the rounding of
pale green cones on countless spruce-branches, the push of myriads of
sweet-fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood,
and the crowding shoots of meadowsweet and yellow flags in the pasture
beyond. All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of
calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance. Every leaf
and bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading
sweetness in which the pungency of pine-sap prevailed over the spice
of thyme and the subtle perfume of fern, and all were merged in a moist
earth-smell that was like the breath of some huge sun-warmed animal.

Charity had lain there a long time, passive and sun-warmed as the slope
on which she lay, when there came between her eyes and the dancing
butterfly the sight of a man’s foot in a large worn boot covered with
red mud.

“Oh, don’t!” she exclaimed, raising herself on her elbow and stretching
out a warning hand.

“Don’t what?” a hoarse voice asked above her head.

“Don’t stamp on those bramble flowers, you dolt!” she retorted,
springing to her knees. The foot paused and then descended clumsily on
the frail branch, and raising her eyes she saw above her the bewildered
face of a slouching man with a thin sunburnt beard, and white arms
showing through his ragged shirt.

“Don’t you ever SEE anything, Liff Hyatt?” she assailed him, as he stood
before her with the look of a man who has stirred up a wasp’s nest.

He grinned. “I seen you! That’s what I come down for.”

“Down from where?” she questioned, stooping to gather up the petals his
foot had scattered.

He jerked his thumb toward the heights. “Been cutting down trees for Dan
Targatt.”

Charity sank back on her heels and looked at him musingly. She was
not in the least afraid of poor Liff Hyatt, though he “came from the
Mountain,” and some of the girls ran when they saw him. Among the more
reasonable he passed for a harmless creature, a sort of link between the
mountain and civilized folk, who occasionally came down and did a little
wood cutting for a farmer when hands were short. Besides, she knew the
Mountain people would never hurt her: Liff himself had told her so
once when she was a little girl, and had met him one day at the edge
of lawyer Royall’s pasture. “They won’t any of ‘em touch you up there,
f’ever you was to come up.... But I don’t s’pose you will,” he had added
philosophically, looking at her new shoes, and at the red ribbon that
Mrs. Royall had tied in her hair.
