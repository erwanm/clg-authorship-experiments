he is a fool. Only man can be a fool. It distin 
guishes him from the higher animals." 

I cannot describe the unutterable scorn that blazed 
in his eyes as Benoni poured out the vials of his 
wrath on the unlucky human race. With my views, 
we were not likely to agree in this matter. 

" Who are you ? " I asked. " What right can you 
possibly have to abuse us all in such particularly 
strong terms ? Do you ever make proselytes to your 
philosophy ? " 



 

" No," said he, answering my last question, and recovering his serenity with that strange quickness of 
transition I had remarked when he had made music 
during his previous visit. " No, they all die before I 
have taught them anything." 

" That does not surprise me, baron," said I. He 
laughed a little. 

" Well, perhaps it would surprise you even less if 
you knew me better," he replied. "But really, I 
came here to talk about Cardegna, and not to chatter 
about that contemptible creature, man, who is not 
worth a moment's notice, I assure you. I believe I 
can find these people, and I confess it would amuse 
me to see the old man's face when we walk in upon 
him. I must be absent for a few days on business in 
Austria, and shall return immediately, for I have not 
taken my bath yet, of which I spoke. Now, if it is 
agreeable to you, I would propose that we go to the 
hills, on my return, and prosecute our search together, 
writing to Nino in the mean time to come here as soon 
as he has finished his engagement in Paris. If he 
comes quickly, he may go with us ; if not, he can join 
us. At all events, we can have a very enjoyable tour 
among the natives, who are charming people, quite 
like animals, as you ought to know." 

I think I must be a very suspicious person. Circumstances have made me so, and perhaps my sus 
picions are very generally wrong. It may be. At 
all events, I did suspect the rich and dandified old 
baron of desiring to have a laugh by putting Nino 
into some absurd situation. He had such strange 
views, or, at least, he talked so oddly, that I did not 



 

believe half he said. It is not possible that anybody 
should seriously hold the opinions he professed. 

When he was gone I sat alone, pondering on the 
situation, which was like a very difficult problem in 
a nightmare, which could not or would not look sensible, do what I would. It chanced that I got a letter 
from Nino that evening, and I confess I was reluctant 
to open it, fearing that he would reproach me with 
not having taken more pains to help him. Before 
opening the envelope, I felt as though I should like 
to go back a fortnight and put forth all my strength 
to find the contessina, and gain a comforting sense of 
duty performed. If I had only done my best, how 
easy it would have been to face a whole sheet of complaints ! Meanwhile the letter was come, and I had 
done nothing worth mentioning. I looked at the 
back of it, and my conscience smote me ; but it had 
to be accomplished, and at last I tore the cover off 
and read. 

Poor Nino ! He said he was ill with anxiety, and 
feared it would injure his voice. He said that to 
break his engagement and come back to Rome would 
be ruin to him. He must face it out, or take the legal 
consequences of a breach of contract, which are over 
whelming to a young artist. He detailed all the 
efforts he had made to find Hedwig, pursuing every 
little sign and clue that seemed to present itself; all 
to no purpose. The longer he thought of it, the more 
certain he was that Hedwig was not in Paris or London. She might be anywhere else in the whole world, 
but she was certainly not in either of those cities. 
Of that he was convinced. He felt like a man who 



 

had pursued a beautiful image to the foot of a precipitous cliff ; the rock had opened and swallowed up his 
dream, leaving him standing alone in hopeless despair; 
and a great deal more poetic nonsense of that kind. 

I do not believe I had ever realised what he so 
truly felt for Hedwig, until I sat at my table with 
his letter before me, overcome with the sense of my 
own weakness in not having effectually checked 
this mad passion at its rise ; or, since it had grown 
so masterfully, of my wretched procrastination in not 
having taken my staff in my hand and gone out into 
the world to find the woman my boy loved and bring 
her to him. By this time, I thought, I should have found 
her. I could not bear to think of his being ill, suffering, heart-broken, ruined, if he lost his voice by an 
illness, merely because I had not had the strength 
to do the best thing for him. Poor Nino, I thought, 
you shall never say again that Cornelio Grandi has 
not done what was in his power to make you happy. 

" That baron ! an apoplexy on him ! has deluded me 
with his promises of help," I said to myself. "He 
has no more intention of helping me or Nino than he 
has of carrying off the basilica of St. Peter. Courage, 
Cornelio ! thou must gird up thy loins, and take a 
little money in thy scrip, and find Hedwig von 
Lira." 

All that night I lay awake, trying to think how 
I might accomplish this end; wondering to which 
point of the compass I should turn, and above all 
reflecting that I must make great sacrifices. But my 
boy must have what he wanted, since he was consuming himself, as we say, in longing for it. It seemed 



 

to me no time for counting the cost, when every day 
might bring upon him a serious illness. If he could 
only know that I was acting, he would allow his 
spirits to revive and take courage. 

In the watches of the night I thought over my 
resources, which, indeed, were meagre enough; for 
I am a very poor man. It was necessary to take a 
great deal of money, for once away from Rome no 
one could tell when I might return. My salary as 
professor is paid to me quarterly, and it was yet some 
weeks to the time when it was due. I had only a 
few francs remaining, not more than enough to pay 
my rent and to feed Mariuccia and me. I had paid 
at Christmas the last installment due on my vineyard 
out of Porta Salara, and though I owed no man anything I had no money, and no prospect of any for 
some time. And yet I could not leave home on a 
long journey without at least two hundred scudi in my 
pocket. A scudo is a dollar, and a dollar has five 
francs, so that I wanted a thousand francs. You see, 
in spite of the baron's hint about the mountains, I 
thought I might have to travel all over Italy before I 
satisfied Nino. 

A thousand francs is a great deal of money, it is 
a Peru, as we say. I had not the first sou toward it. 
I thought a long time. I wondered if the old piano 
were worth anything ; whether anybody would give 
me money for my manuscripts, the results of patient 
years of labour and study ; my old gold scarf-pin, my 
seal ring, and even my silver watch, which really 
keeps very good time, what were they worth ? But 
it would not be much, not the tenth part of what I 



 

wanted. I was in despair, and I tried to sleep. Then 
a thought came to me. 

"I am a donkey," I said. "There is the vine 
yard itself, my little vineyard beyond Porta Sa- 
lara. It is mine, and is worth half as much again 
as I need." And I slept quietly till morning. 

It is true, and I am sure it is natural, that in the 
daylight my resolution looked a little more heroic to 
me than it did in the quiet night. I had toiled and 
scraped a great deal more than you know to buy that 
small piece of land, and it seemed much more my 
own than all Serveti had ever been in my better days.
