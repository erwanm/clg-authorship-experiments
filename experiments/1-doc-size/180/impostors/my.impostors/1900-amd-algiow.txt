speedily arranged. There were friends ready enough to be bridesmaids;
indeed, the subject was taken up in such earnest that Jaqueline was
likely to be married out of hand. All that was really needed was a
wedding gown and an appearing-out dress; all the rest could be done
afterward, and there was her mother's bridal gown waiting for her.

When it came to the point, instead of a simple wedding it was a very
grand one. One of the Cabinet ladies sent her a veil to wear because
it was luck to be married in something borrowed, and the veil had been
worn at the coronation of King George. Mrs. Sweeny worked night and
day altering over the wedding gown, which was a mass of satin, sheer
gauze, and lace, with a train carried by a daintily attired page.
Annis held her prayer book and her glove when the ring was put on her
finger. Christ Church was crowded with the Ã©lite of Washington, said
a journal of the day. Mrs. Madison graced the scene, and Mrs. Cutts,
with whom Jaqueline was a great favorite, while Judge and Mrs. Todd
were warm in congratulations. It was really quite an event, and Roger
felt almost as if he had married a princess of the blood royal. Such
parties and dinners as were showered upon the young couple, and such
compliments as the handsome bride received, were almost enough to turn
one's head.

Annis was kept busy writing journal-like letters to mamma and Charles.
And what treasures the old journals and letters are to-day! How Mrs.
Carrington went to Christ Church Sunday morning in "a violet satin
gown trimmed with fine silk ruffles edged with lace, and a white
satin petticoat with embroideries in violet silk and gold thread. A
fine-wrought lace scarf that her own mother had brought from Paris,
white satin boots with gold lacings, long white silk gloves embroidered
in lavender, and a white Neapolitan hat with a wide fluted rim, trimmed
with a drawn silk lining and rows of piping, and a great cluster of
lilies and violets and ostrich plumes."

The wedding veil was returned. Annis was to wear the wedding gown
later on, and at a very modern entertainment quite late in the century
Jaqueline's grand-daughter won no end of admiration in it.

So when Randolph Mason had given his eldest daughter away, and kissed
her good-by with a thousand tender wishes, he went back to the pale
little son and his dear nurse, as if he had had some sort of a gala
dream mixed up with a whirlwind.

"I wish Jacky had waited," said Charles with a sigh. "I should like to
have seen it."

"It wouldn't have been half so grand at home. Washington is a fine
place for such a thing."

"Finer than Philadelphia?"

"Oh, no!" Mr. Mason smiled, remembering the simple church. There were
grander ones here. And, except the Capitol, the White House, and parts
of several public buildings, there was nothing so very grand. But the
concourse of people could hardly have been matched.

"Didn't Annis want to come with you?"

"She did at first. Then the wedding drove all other desires out of her
mind. I was afraid she would make a time when I started. But everything
was in such a bustle!"

"Couldn't she have come here for a week or two, before we start?"

"How would we have sent her back?"

"We wouldn't have sent her back then," said the boy triumphantly.

His father smiled. "She has grown so, and changed some way. Her hair is
not quite so light. And she can chatter in French like a native. Patty
thinks her very smart."

"And I have not grown any!" he subjoined in a disconsolate tone. "I
am not allowed to study. She will get way ahead of me. But she doesn't
know Latin, and she can't go to college."

And perhaps he could marry her. He was not so sure of that now. Perhaps
he would never marry anyone. But he was glad Roger Carrington had
Jaqueline.

Annis tried very hard to be sorry at not seeing her mother. She was
frightened because she did not want to cry over it as she had at
first. She had given up mamma to Charles, and to be sorry and want her
back was selfish. Then there were so many things to do, and so many
pleasures. There was not time enough to run over to Aunt Jane's every
day, yet the children were so fond of her. She knew some girls, too,
who were asking her to supper every few days, or to join some party
to the woods, or to sail up or down the river. It was such a lovely
thing to be alive and well! When that came into her mind her very heart
melted in pity for Charles.

Then, it was queer, but Louis had taken to calling her his little girl.
He teased her sometimes, but he came to take her riding when she had
any spare hours. She could hardly decide which was the handsomer, Louis
or Mr. Carrington, and she thought it rather disloyal. Jaqueline said
Roger was, by far.

And then came the plans for housekeeping. Roger and she inspected some
houses. It would be more convenient in Washington, but Georgetown was
much prettier. And there were suburban districts.

"But think of the winter nights in the rain and the mud, and sometimes
sleet, and the time wasted going back and forth. Isn't it a bit of
patriotism to want to build up one's own city? We are a small people as
yet, compared to some other places. If we don't increase and multiply
and spread out, and fill up our vacant squares, our honor may be taken
from us."

"After so noble an argument I shall have to agree with you that it is
our bounden duty to remain," replied Jaqueline with an arch smile.

"Mother would like us at Georgetown, but she has Ralph and his wife."

"Oh, do stay!" cried Annis. "I like Washington so much!"

"The casting vote. We remain. Annis, you are to come with us. We
couldn't give you up now."

"Until mamma comes home. Of course I belong to her."

They went down to the old plantation, and the house slaves made a big
feast; the field hands had an illumination of lanterns and big pine
knots. But Annis thought the great house lonely. Then she recalled what
her father once said--when all the children were married she would
stay there with her mother and him. Jaqueline and Patty and Varina
would have husbands and children, and Annis shivered at a strange
consciousness of solitude.

Jaqueline had been instructed to take her outfit, and anything she
wanted, her father said. Chloe knew all about the bed and table linen:
didn't she bleach it up every spring in May dew? Such a packing, such a
rejoicing time over missy's husband "that she got at last," which meant
nothing derogatory nor that she had made a great effort; only most of
the slaves had great faith in first loves for white folks, and a happy
ending to an engagement.

There was the house to put in order and the "house-warming" to give, a
grand dinner for married friends and a dance for the young people, when
Louis was master of ceremonies, and bright eyes grew still brighter
with pleasure at his notice.

Almost before one had noted, there were cool nights and ripening
foliage, house-cleaning, and preparation for winter. Ah, how lovely
the banks of the Potomac were, and Rock Creek! Jaqueline begged that
they should take their first ride over again. There were various first
things to do. The mother over at Georgetown claimed them frequently.
Ralph's wife was very nice and sweet, but Jaqueline brought a curious
stir and dazzle in the house, and an atmosphere as of a spring morning.

Charles had improved wonderfully. There were some remarkable springs
up the Hudson that had wonderful health-giving properties. And when
they came back to New York he was so taken with the advantages that
he begged to remain. The doctor in whose charge he had been, promised
to watch over him and not allow him to study too severely, and a nice
boarding place had been found for him with a charming motherly woman.

"Oh, Annis!" cried her mother, holding her off after the first fond
embrace, "let me look at you. I have lost my little girl!"

"Mamma, I couldn't stay little always. But the part that loves and
thinks doesn't change, and I have tried very hard sometimes not to want
you when I knew Charles needed you. I am so glad to get you back! Oh,
you do believe that? But there is a queer thing I don't understand.
When we first came to Virginia it was very hard to try to love the
others when they took so much attention."

She was studying her mother with large, earnest, lustrous eyes.

"Yes," said Mrs. Mason, with a fond embrace.

"And now I love them all so much. I'm not quite sure about Varina--I
have not seen her in so long. But I love you the best."

The mother kissed her fondly. No one, not even her husband, who was so
grateful for the sacrifice she had made, knew how hard a trial it had
been to her.

Just as they were considering whether they could leave Annis at school
and do without her, word came from the Pineries. Mrs. Floyd had a
sudden stroke, not so very severe, but at her time of life a serious
matter.
