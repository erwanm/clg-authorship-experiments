She is on her way now. She will be here very soon." 

" Colville did not know exactly what to say to 
these passionately consecutive statements. "Well ?" 
he said at last. 

"Well" — she repeated his word — "what do you 
intend to do ? " 

" Intend to do in what event ? " he asked, lifting 
his eyes for the first time to the eyes which he felt 
burning down upon him. 

" If she should refuse ? " 

Again he could not command an instant answer, 
but when it came it was a fair one. " It isn't for 
me to say what I shall do," he replied gravely. 
" Or, if it is, I can only say that I will do whatever 
you wish." 

" Do you wish nothing ? " 

" Nothing but your happiness." 

" Nothing but my happiness ! " she retorted. 
" What is my happiness to me ? Have I ever sought 
it?" 

"I can't say," he answered; "but if I did not 
think you would find it '' 

" I shall find it, if ever I find it, in yours," she 
interrupted. " And what shall you do if my mother 
will not consent to our engagement ? " 

The experienced and sophisticated man — for that 



 

"in no ill way was what Colville was — felt himself 
on trial for his honour and his manhood by this 
simple girl, this child. He could not endure to fall 
short of her ideal of him at that moment, no matter 
"what error or calamity the fulfilment involved. 
"If you feel sure that you love me, Imogene, it will 
make no difference to me what your mother says. 
I would he glad of her consent ; I should hate to go 
counter to her will ; hut I know that I am good 
enough man to be true and keep you all my life the 
first in all my thoughts, and that 's enough for me. 
But if you have any fear, any doubt of yourself, now 
is the time " 

Imogene rose to her feet as in some turmoil of 
thought or emotion that would not suffer her to re- 
main quiet. 

" Oh, keep still ! " " Don't get up yet ! " " Hold 
on a minute, please ! " came from the artists in dif- 
ferent parts of the theatre, and half a dozen implor- 
ing pencils were waved in the air. 

" They are sketching you," said Colville, and she 
sank compliantly into her seat again. 

" I have no doubt for myself — no," she said, as if 
there had been no interruption. 

" Then we need have no anxiety in meeting your 
mother," said Colville, with a light sigh, after a 
moment's pause. " What makes you think she will 
be unfavourable ? " 

"I don't think that; but I thought— I didn't 
know but " 

"What?" 



 

"Notliiiig, now." Her lips were quivering; he 
could see her struggle for self-control, but he could 
not see it unmoved. 

" Poor child ! " he said, putting out his hand to- 
ward her. 

" Don't take my hand ; they 're all looking," she 
begged. 

He forbore, and they remained silent and motion- 
less a little while, before she had recovered herself 
sufficiently to speak again. 

" Then we are promised to each other, whatever 
happens," she said. 

" Yes." 

" And we will never speak of this again. But 
there is one thing. Did Mrs. Bowen ask you to 
tell Mr. Morton of our engagement ? " 

" She said that I ought to do so." 

" And did you say you would ? " 

" I don't know. But I suppose I ought to tell 
him." 

" I don't wish you to ! " cried the girl. 

" You don't wish me to tell him ? " 

" No ; I will not have it ! " 

"Oh, very well; it's much easier not. But it 
seems to me that it 's only fair to him.'' 

"Did you think of that yourself?" she demanded 
fiercely. 

"No," returned Colville, with sad self-recognition. 
" I 'm afraid I 'm not apt to think of the comforts 
and rights of other people. It was Mrs. Bowen 
who thought of it."

" I knew it ! " 

"But I must confess that I agreed with her, 
though I would have preferred to postpone it till we 
heard from your family." He was thoughtfully 
silent a momjnt; then he said, "But if their deci- 
sion is to have no weight with us, I think he ought 
to be told at once." 

"Do you think that I am flirting with him? " 

" Imogene ! " exclaimed Colville reproachfully. 

" That 's what you imply; that 's what she implies." 

" You 're very unjust to Mrs. Bowen, Imogene." 

" Oh, you always defend her ! It isn't the first 
time you 've told me I was unjust to her." 

" I don't mean that you are willingly unjust, or 
could be so, to any living creature, least of all to her. 
But I — we — owe her so much ; she has been so 
patient." 

"What do we owe her? How has she been 
patient ? " 

"She has overcome her dislike to me.'' 

" Oh, indeed ! " 

" And — and I feel under obligation to her for — in 
a thousand little ways ; and I should be glad to feel 
that we were acting with her approval ; I should like 
to please her." 

" You wish to tell Mr. Morton ? " 

" I think I ought." 

" To please Mrs. Bowen ! Tell him, then ! You
