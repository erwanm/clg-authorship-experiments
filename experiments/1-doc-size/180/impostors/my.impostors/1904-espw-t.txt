ennui, as one who regarded the occasion 
small and irritating, and his case, in the 
nature of things, assured. Physicians and 
medical students of such types as the modern 
schools turn out jammed every permissible 
space. Lawyers were present in considerable 
numbers. 

Uncomfortably aware that they were but 



 

coldly welcomed by " the other half of the 
world " in this extraordinary scene, yet stol- 
idly defiant of the fact, sat the uninfluential, 
the obscure, the children of the poor — whom 
we are accustomed to forget until we need 
them — the plain and powerful people whose 
voice is apt to be clearer, and sure to be 
stronger in the moral note than our own. 

These had come up to champion one of them- 
selves — an orphan lad, at whose instance the 
great medical school was placed in a position 
hitherto unimagined, and embarrassing to an 
obvious decree. 

The day was cold (it was January) and a 
threatened storm was frowning. The court- 
room was not quite dark enough to light arti- 
ficially, but so dull of tint that, when an arrow 
of sun ran through the army of clouds charg- 
ing across the sky, and stabbed a window, 
the effect was followed by every eye in the 
room. It so chanced that the poignant ray 
struck the lame lad's attorney, who had at that 
moment risen, and stood preeminent in the 
brilliance — his tall height, his strong head, 
his direct features expressing a certain straight- 
forwardness and manly sincerity, a certain fear- 



 

lessness in moral matters united to a marked 
intellectual force, which commanded instinc- 
tive respect. 

His little client, who sat silent and pale be- 
low him, stirred sensitively as the sunlight faded 
slowly from Surbridge's face and figure, and 
the boy glanced towards the rear of the room 
where his neighbors and friends from Blind 
Alley were crowded together. Among them, 
yet clearly to the most careless eye not of 
them, a lady, closely veiled, sheltered a small 
object behind her muff. A tiny white ear, 
cocked alertly above the dark fur, was fol- 
lowed by a little struggling white face, rebel- 
lious and determined. The lame boy held up 
one finger, and the little face disappeared from 
sight as the proceedings of the day began. 

The preliminaries were disposed of rather 
quickly, and with that indifference to social 
claims or intellectual position characteristic of 
abstract justice, and of the concrete judge pre- 
siding — an eccentric man, with an irritable 
mouth, a kind eye, and an imperious manner. 
The distinguished scientists (from whose num- 
ber Professor Steele was conspicuously absent) 
involved in this extraordinary complication 



 

were conscious of a vexed surprise at their 
position. The academic world is not a wide 
one, the scientific portion of it least endowed 
with imagination, and neither experience nor 
fancy had prepared these gentlemen for a se- 
rious legal situation ; where the latest bacillus 
or the new serum was without palpable sig- 
nificance, where the standards of the lecture- 
room, the achievements of the laboratory, or 
the reputation of a coterie went for nothing. 
The fact that they might go for less than 
nothing occurred slowly to Dr. Bernard (all 
his mental processes were leisurely) when he 
found himself, like any common, uninstructed 
fellow, summoned to the bar. 

The complaint was read rather impressively. 
It was an incredibly vulgar charge — that of 
receiving stolen property. To this Charles 
Claudius Bernard, Instructor, and Thomas 
Sleigh, Janitor of Galen Medical School, sev- 
erally pleaded not guilty : and the trial pro- 
gressed as briskly as possible. 

Surbridge, who handled the case from the 
outset in a manner as unconventional as the 
most conventional of professions allowed him, 
made a brief and blazing opening of the sort 



 

which led lawyers who did not know him to 
whisper : " Effective. But theatricals won't 
carry this case. It needs a stone-crusher." 

" Wait," answered an elderly member of 
the bar, "you 'll have both before he gets 
through. I knew his father." 

The witnesses for the prosecution were put 
forward rapidly — it seemed to be Surbridge's 
purpose to avoid tiring the court — and, de- 
layed only by the inevitable cross-examination, 
these presented their testimony, on the whole, 
with a clearness which indicated rather an 
unusual drill, or unusual harmony between 
counsel and witness. 

Daniel Badger took his oath solemnly, as 
if he had been undergoing- initiation vows at 
the Lodge of the Grand Mooses. He testified 
distinctly in his plaintive voice. Now and then 
he gestured a little with his crutch ; he had a 
pleasing expression of confidence in the judge, 
not entirely lost upon his Honor, whose sharp 
lips curved into a withered smile when the lad, 
suddenly overborne by the pathos of his story, 
forgetting that he had been directed only to 
answer questions, leaned heavily upon his 
crutch, lifted one thin hand high in the air 



 

(apparently under the impression that he was 
taking another oath), and, before Surbridge 
could stop him, thus personally addressed the 
Bench : 

" Ye see, Judge, Trixy she 's all I got. 
Me V Trixy haven't anybody but her 'n' me. 
It was tumble to steal Trixy. It ain't so much 
them shows and her bein' edoocated — you 
never see a dog know so much as Trixy does — 
an' folks have to make a livin' — me 'n' Trixy 
used to make ourn before she was took away 
from me that time. But that ain't it. I 'd 'a' 
starved, Judge, and welcome, any day, an' I 
wouldn't 'a' minded much — I druther most 
anything than have anything happen to Trixy." 

Here Surbridge, inwardly delighted, felt 
bound to interpose. 

"You may go on, my lad," said the judge 
indulgently. " It may be of help in getting 
at the facts," he added, leveling a straight 
glance at the respectful protest in the face 
of the colWe counsel. " Let us hear what 
the boy has to say." 

" She played so pretty, too," proceeded 
Dan with quavering voice. " Didn't ye never 
see her play, Judge? It warn't only ten
