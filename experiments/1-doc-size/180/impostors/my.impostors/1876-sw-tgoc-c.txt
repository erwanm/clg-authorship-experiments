seemed so much alone.'

'That was a mistake, Hazel.'

'I only said it seemed so. But there was a certain truth in it, too; 
because happy people never do guess exactly what goes on in the 
rest of the world.'

'Pray, do the unhappy people?'

But Hazel caught the sound of steps, and started away from her 
foot-cushion time enough to meet Dr. Arthur midway in the room.

'Rested, Dane?' said the doctor, standing before his late patient.

'That does not sound like a complicated question,' said Dane; 'but it 
means a good deal. I am ready.'

'What he wants,' said Dr. Arthur, turning gravely to Wych Hazel, 
'is a change. If your grace could persuade him to go off for a while, 
in the right company, he would come back a new man.'

'I shall have a change this week,' said Dane rising. 'Come along, 
old fellow, or I shall prescribe for you.I shall be here as early as 
I can, Hazel; before dinner.'


CHAPTER XXI.

THE LOSS OF POWER.


Wych Hazel ordered an early lunch for herself, and a fire in the red 
room, and fresh flowers for its adornment; and with these last she 
was busyhumming over them the spell of an old German 
choralwhen Rollo came in. The air was dainty with fragrance 
and sweet sounds. He smiled at it, and at Hazel; but after the first 
greeting was grave again.

'I have got news for you to-day,' he said.

'Have you?' said Hazel, intent on placing a Safrano rose. Then the 
tone caught her attention and she looked up hastily.

'Not more sickness?'

He shook his head. 'Paul Charteris has stopped work.'

'Is that all?' said Wych Hazel. 'The wonder to me is that such men 
ever go on.'

'He has not failed. He has stopped work. That is enough, of you 
knew what it means.'

'Not that all his men are turned adrift?'

'Just that. Three or four hundred families.'

'But they cannot move off and find work in the dead of winter!
What is the man thinking of?'

'Only, I suppose, of what are called the exigencies of business. 
There is not a good market, just now, for his cloths; he would be 
largely out of pocket presently if he went on paying out, with 
nothing coming in.'

'Could he do it?'

'I cannot tell.'

She bent thoughtfully over her flowers for a minute, touching them 
here and there; then looked up again.

'Have the same exigencies come near you?'

He smiled. 'No. I am sound yet.'

'ButI have heard business enough talked, if I could only 
remember it!does not such a state of things by and by touch all 
goods and mills and mill-owners?'

'Sometimes. But nothing threatens me at present. Perhaps Charteris 
is less strong than he has been supposed. Perhaps he has been 
speculating.'

Hazel finished her flowers with another touch or two, and 
gathering up the scattered rose leavescrimson and white and 
buffshowered them gently down upon the hand that rested near 
her on the table. Then she glanced up with a laugh.

'You know,' she said, 'the Charteris mills are my department.'

'Indeed! How am I to understand that statement?'

'Oyou thought Christmas was not susceptible of extensions. 
Gentlemen's ideas, being so strong, sometimes move slowly.'

'Ladies' thoughts, being so subtle, are sometimes difficult to 
pursue,' said Dane; but his brow was grave.

'I am talking nonsense,' said the girl, 'but I mean sense. There is 
money enough,and those people cannot starve, either with 
hunger or cold. And you have all your own men on your own 
hands,andI begin to understand what Dr. Arthur meant by 
"possible corners." Don't you see that the other part of the Hollow 
falls naturally to me? What is the matter? Are you afraid I will 
support them on pound-cake and sugarplums?'

Dane's eyes leapt, and darkened, and lightened; but after all, his 
answer was sober.

'That will do; but you cannot permanently support Mr. Charteris's 
mill hands on charity. The only sure method of relief would be to 
buy up the mills.'

'Then we can run them against each other!' said Wych Hazel. 
'What a splendid thought! I shall be a better neighbour that Mr. 
Charteris. I will only undersell you just a little.'

Dane smiled, but this time he said nothing. Only watched her 
continually.

'Then as Mr. Falkirk's consent might be difficult to get,he is a 
little insane upon mills just now,perhaps the purchase had better 
be made with the remains of my last winter's legacy. Over which, 
you know, nobody has any control but my own wise self.'

'How much do you suppose the purchase of those mills might 
require?'

'I have no idea. The legacy was largeand there is a good deal 
left.'

'A few hundred thousands?'

No, not so much as that. Well,then I must have another ugly talk 
with Mr. Falkirk. He would not listen to you, one minute.'

'I should not listen to you, either, Wych; and I should have to be 
taken into consultation, you know.'

'Is not your consent enough, without consultation?'

'I could not properly give it.'

'Dear me,' said the girl, 'what a word 'properly' is! I think I never 
wanted to do anything, or go anywhere, that it did not rise up 
before me like a five-barred gate. What can I 'properly' do, sir, if 
you please, in the premises?'

Looking with his mighty gray eyes into her face,soft they were 
too, and persuading, as well as mighty,he said in a sort of 
whisper,

'Go with me to New York, Wych! Then we can make it all right.'

Her face grew suddenly grave with a frightened look, as if she had 
stepped into a net, or caught herself in a trap.

'We were not talking of that,' she said hurriedly,'and there is no 
need to talk of that. And you promised.'

'There is no need to talk about it, if it is ever to be done,' said Dane 
smiling. 'If you will think about itwhich I believe you never do, 
you will perceive that unless we are to be separated all our lives, 
we must some time or other be married. And the best way with 
anything you are afraid of, is to do it, and have it over!'

He had smiled, and his accent was very winning; but he grew 
grave again, and stood with folded arms looking at Wych Hazel. 
Even then he would not use persuasions; he would not have her 
against her will; but he watched her anxiously. If she refused him 
now, it might be long before he brought up the subject again. He 
would not tell her that, either; he left her free; and waited to see 
how the delicate balances of her mind would turn. But he sighed a 
little as she hesitated, and then smiled again as he spoke; a smile 
very frank and sweet.

'Be brave, Hazel! If you are ever going to trust me, you may as 
well do it at once.'
