When we came to the base of the rock, we found a way 
cut, a narrow path, most of the distance hewn out of the 
rock, winding upward along the face of the precipice. 
The view, as one rises, is of the break-neck description. 
The way is really safe enough, even on mule-back, as- 
cending ; but one would be foolhardy to ride down. We 
met a lady on the summit who was about to be carried 
down on a chair ; and she seemed quite to like the mode 
of conveyance : she had harnessed her husband in tem- 
porarily for one of the bearers, which made it still more 
jolly for her. When we started, a cloud of mist hung 
over the edge of the rocks. As we rose, it descended 
to meet us, and sunk below, hiding the valley and its 
houses, which had looked like Swiss toys from our height. 
When we reached the summit, the mist came boiling up 
after us, rising like a thick wall to the sky, and hiding 
all that great mountain range, the Vallais Alps, from 
which we had come, and which we hoped to see from 
this point. Fortunately, there were no clouds on the 
other side, and we looked down into a magnificent rocky 
basin, encircled by broken and over-topping crags and 
snow-fields, at the bottom of which was a green lake. 
It is one of the wildest of scenes. 

An hour from the summit, we came to a green Alp, 
where a herd of cows were feeding ; and in the midst of 


it were three or four dirty chalets, where pigs, chickens, 
cattle, and animals constructed very much like human 
beings, lived ; yet I have nothing to say against these 
chalets, for we had excellent cream there. We had, on 
the way down, fine views of the snowy Altels, the Rinder- 
horn, the Finster-Aarhorn, — a deep valley which enor- 
mous precipices guard, but which avalanches nevertheless 
invade, — and, farther on, of the Bllimlisalp, with its sum- 
mit of crystalline whiteness. The descent to Kandersteg 
is very rapid, and in a rain slippery. This village is a 
resort for artists for its splendid views of the range we 
had crossed: it stands at the gate of the mountains. 
From there to the Lake of Thun is a delightful drive, — 
a rich country, with handsome cottages and a charming 
landscape, even if the pyramidal Niesen did not lift up 
its seven thousand feet on the edge of the lake. So, 
through a smiling land, and in the sunshine after the 
rain, we come to Spiez, and find ourselves at a little 
hotel on the slope, overlooking town and lake and moun- 
tains. 

 Spiez is not large : indeed, its few houses are nearly all 
picturesquely grouped upon a narrow rib of land which 
is thrust into the lake on purpose to make the loveliest 
picture in the world. There is the old castle, with its 
many slim spires and its square-peaked roofed tower ; 
the slender-steepled church; a fringe of old houses below 
on the lake, one overhanging towards the point ; and the 
promontory, finished by a willow drooping to the water. 
Beyond, in hazy light, over the lucid green of the lake, 
are mountains whose masses of rock seem soft and sculp- 
tured. To the right, at the foot of the lake, tower the 
great snow mountains, — the cone of the Schreckhorn, 
the square top of the Eiger, the Jungfrau, just shoving 
over the hills, and the Blumlisalp rising into heaven clear 
and silvery. 

What can one do in such a spot, but swim in the lake, 
lie on the shore, and watch the passing steamers and the 
changing light on the mountains ? Down at the wharf, 





when the small boats put off for the steamer, one can 
well entertain himself. The small boat is an enormous 
thing, after all, and propelled by two long, heavy sweeps, 
one of which is pulled, and the other pushed. The labor- 
ing oar is, of course, pulled by a woman ; while her hus- 
band stands up in the stern of the boat, and gently dips 
the other in a gallant fashion. There is a boy there, 
whom I cannot make out, — a short, square boy, with tas- 
selled skull-cap, and a face that never changes its expres- 
sion, and never has any expression to change ; he may 
be older than these hills ; he looks old enough to be his 
own father : and there is a girl, his counterpart, who 
might be, judging her age by her face, the mother of 
both of them. These solemn old-young people are quite 
busy doing nothing about the wharf, and appear to be 
afflicted with an undue sense of the responsibility of 
life. There is a beer-garden here, where several sober 
couples sit seriously drinking their beer. There are 
some horrid old women, with the parchment skin and 
the disagreeable necks. Alone, in a window of the cas- 
tle, sits a lady at her work, who might be the countess ; 
only, I am sorry, there is no countess, nothing but a 
frau, in that old feudal dwelling. And there is a for- 
eigner, thinking how queer it all is. And, while he sits 
there, the melodious bell in the church-tower rings its 
evening sons;. 



BAVARIA. 



AMERICAN IMPATIENCE. 

"TTTE left Switzerland, as we entered it, in a rain, — 
VV a kind of double baptism that may have been 
necessary, and was certainly not too heavy a price to 
pay for the privileges of the wonderful country. The 
wind blew freshly, and swept a shower over the deck of 
the little steamboat, on board of which we stepped from 
the shabby little pier and town of Romanshorn. After 
the other Swiss lakes, Constance is tame, except at the 
southern end, beyond which rise the Appenzell range 
and the wooded peaks of the Bavarian hills. Through 
the dash of rain, and under the promise of a magnificent 
rainbow, — rainbows don't mean any thing in Switzer- 
land, and have no office as weather-prophets, except to 
assure you, that, as it rains to-day, so it will rain to-mor- 
row, — we skirted the lower bend of the lake, and at twi- 
light sailed into the little harbor of Lindau, through the 
narrow entrance between the piers, on one of which is a 
small lighthouse, and on the other sits upright a gigantic 
stone lion, — a fine enough figure of a Bavarian lion, but 
with a comical, wide-awake, and expectant expression of 
countenance, as if he might bark right out at any minute, 
and become a dog. Yet in the moonlight, shortly after- 
ward, the lion looked very grand and stately, as he sat 
regarding the softly-plashing waves, and the high, drift- 
ing clouds, and the old Roman tower by the bridge, 
which connects the Island of Lindau with the mainland, 
and thinking perhaps, if stone lions ever do think, of 
the time when Roman galleys sailed on Lake Constance 

 

and when Lindau was an imperial town with a thriying 
trade. 

On board the little steamer was an American, accom- 
panied by two ladies, and travelling, I thought, for their 
gratification, who was very anxious to get on faster than 
he was able to do, — though why any one should desire to 
go fast in Europe I do not know. One easily falls into 
the habit of the country, — to take things easily, to go 
wlien the slow German fates will, and not to worry one's 
self beforehand about times and connections. But the 
American was in a fever of impatience, desirous, if possi- 
ble, to get on that night. I knew he was from the Land 
of the Free by a phrase I heard him use in the cars : he 
said, " I'll bet a dollar." Yet I must flatter myself that 
Americans do not always thus betray themselves. I 
happened, on the Isle of Wight, to hear a bland land- 
lord " blow up " his glib-tongued son because the latter 
had not driven a stiffer bargain with us for the hire of a 
carriage round the island. 

" Didn't you know they were Americans ? " asks the 
irate father. " I knew it at once." 

" No," replies young hopeful : " they didn't say guess 
once." 

And straightway the fawning innkeeper returns to 
us, professing, with his butter-lips, the greatest admira- 
tion of all Americans, and the intensest anxiety to serve 
them, and all for pure good-will. The English are even 
more bloodthirsty at sight of a traveller than the Swiss, 
and twice as obsequious. But to return to our Ameri- 
can. He had all the railway-time tables that he could 
procure ; and he was busily studying them, with the de- 
sign of " getting on." I heard him say to his compan- 
ions, as he ransacked his pockets, that he was a mass of 
hotel- bills and time-tables. He confided to me after- 
ward, that his wife and her friend had got it into their 
heads that they must go both to Vienna and Berlin. 
Was Berlin much out of the way in going from Vienna
