" Don't kiss me," she exclaimed sharply, 
trying to free herself. 

" Why not ? " he demanded, in surprise. " Why 
should I not kiss you ? " 

She let her head drop again to his shoulder. 
"True," she said; "why should you not? It is 
only that I forget that I am not the woman I 
dreamed I was; and for her — it was wrong to 
kiss you." 



 

" Weir, tell me your dream at once. It is for 
your good as well as mine that I insist. You 
will be miserable and terrified until you take 
someone into your confidence. I believe I can 
explain your dream, as well as give you the 
comfort of talking it over with you." 

She slipped suddenly out of his arms and 
walked quickly to the end of the room and 
back, pausing within a few feet of him. The 
room was growing dark, and he could distinguish 
little of her beyond the tall outline of her form 
and the unnatural brilliancy of her eyes, but he 
respected her wish and remained where he was. 

"Very well," she said, rapidly. "I will tell 
you. I went to sleep without much terror, for I 
had told my maid to sleep in my dressing-room. 
But I suppose the storm and the story I had told 
you had unsettled my nerves, for I soon began 
to dream a horrid dream. I thought I was dead 
once more. I could feel the horrible chill and 
pain, the close-packed ice about me. I was 
dead, but yet there was a spirit within me. I 
could feel it whispering to itself, although it had 
not as yet spread its fire through me and 
awakened me into life. It whispered that it was tired, 
and disheartened, and disappointed, and wanted 
rest; that it had been on a long, fruitless journey, 
and was so weary that it would not take up the 
burden of life again just yet. But its rest could 
not be long; there was someone it must find, 



 

and before he had gone again to that boundless 
land, whose haunting spirits were impalpable as 
flecks of mist. And then it moaned and wept, 
and seemed to live over its past, and I went back 
with it, or I was one with it — I cannot define. It 
recalled many scenes, but only one made an 
impression on my memory; I can recall no other." 
She paused abruptly, but Dartmouth made no 
comment; he stood motionless in breathless 
expectancy. She put her hand to her head, and 
after a moment continued haltingly: 

"I — oh — I hardly know how to tell it. I 
seemed to be standing with you in a room more 
familiar to me than any room in this castle; a 
room full of tapestries and skins and cushions 
and couches; a room which if I had seen it in a 
picture I should have recognized as Oriental, 
although I have never seen an Oriental room. I 
have always had an indescribable longing to see 
Constantinople, and it seemed to me in that 
dream as if I had but to walk to the window and 
look down upon it — as if I had looked down upon 
it many times and loved its beauty. But although 
I was with you, and your arms were about me, we 
were not as we are now — as we were before the 
dream: we had suffered all that a man and a 
woman can suffer who love and are held apart. 
And you looked as you do now, yet utterly 
different. You looked years older, and you were 
dressed so strangely. I do not know how I 



 

looked, but I know how I felt. I felt that I had 
made up my mind to commit a deadly sin, and 
that I gloried in it. I had suffered because to 
love you was a sin; but I only loved you the more 
for that reason. Then you slowly drew me 
further into the room and pressed me more 
closely in your arms and kissed me again, and 
then — I — oh — I do not know — it is all so vague 
I don't know what it meant — but it seemed as if 
the very foundations of my life were being swept 
away. And yet — oh, I cannot explain ! I do 
not know, myself." And she would have thrown 
herself headlong on the sofa had not Dartmouth 
sprang forward and caught her. 

"There, never mind," he said, quickly. " Let 
that go. It is of no consequence. A dream like 
that must necessarily end in a climax of 
incoherence and excitement." 

He drew her down on the sofa, and for a 
moment said nothing further. He had to 
acknowledge that she had deepened the mystery, and 
given no key. A silence fell, and neither 
moved. Suddenly she raised her head. " What 
was your dream ? " she demanded. 

" The same. I don't pretend to explain it. 
And I shall not insult your understanding by 
inventing weak excuses. If it means anything 
we will give the problem no rest until we have 
solved it. If we cannot solve it, then we are 
justified in coming to the conclusion that there 



 

is nothing in it. But I believe we shall get to 
the bottom of it yet." 

" Perhaps," she said, wearily; " I do not know. 
I only feel that I shall never be myself again, 
but must go through life with that woman's 
burden of sin and suffering weighing me down." 
She paused a moment, and then continued: " In 
that dream I wore a dress like this, and that is 
the reason I put it on to-night. I was getting 
some things in Paris before I left, and [ bought 
it thinking you would like it; I had heard you 
say that yellow was your favorite color. When 
my maid opened the door of my wardrobe to-night 
to take out a dress, and I saw this hanging there, it 
gave me such a shock that I caught at a chair to 
keep from falling. And then I felt irresistibly 
. impelled to put it on. I felt as if it were a shroud, 
vivid in color as it is; but it had an uncanny 
fascination for me, and I experienced a morbid de- 
light in feeling both spirit and flesh revolt, and 
yet compelling them to do my will. I never 
knew that it was in me to feel so, but I suppose I 
am utterly demoralized by so realistically living 
over again that awful experience of my 
childhood. If it happened again I should either be 
carried back to the vault for good and all, or end 
my days in the topmost tower of the castle, with 
a keeper, and the storms and sea-gulls for sole 
companions." 

She sat up in a moment, and putting her 



 

hand on his shoulder, looked him full in the 
face for the first time. " It seems to me that I 
know you now," she said, "and that I never knew 
you before. When I first saw you to-night I 
shrank from you: why, I hardly know, except 
that the personality of that woman had woven 
itself so strongly into mine that for the moment 
I felt I had no right to love you. But I have 
never loved you as I do to-night, because that 
dream, however little else I may have to thank it 
for, did for me this at least: it seemed to give me 
a glimpse into every nook and corner of your 
character; I feel now that my understanding of 
your strange nature is absolute. I had seen 
only one side of it before, and had made but
