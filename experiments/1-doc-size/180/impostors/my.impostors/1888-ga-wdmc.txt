about something else. Those eyes — gods ! 
And what a figure ! What — " 

With a nervous, precipitate motion, he rose to 
his feet and drew in his breath, as if to throw a 
sudden load from his chest. He stood irresolute 
for a moment, then revolving slowly on his heel, 
walked, as if independently of his own volition, 
over to his desk. He felt very strangely; he 
did not remember to have ever felt so strangely 
before. His head had become suddenly confused, 
but at the same time he was aware that 
his brain had thrown open its doors to a new 
arrival, and that the visitor was trying to make 
itself heard. It appeared to be a visitor of 
great importance, and Dartmouth was con- 



 

scious that it had presented itself to his
perceptions in the form of an extraordinarily strong 
impulse; a great and clamorous Desire. He had 
been aware of the same desire before, but only 
in an abstract way, a general purposeless long- 
ing; but now this peremptory, loudly-knocking 
consciousness was vaguely suggesting another — 
just behind. It would almost seem, if it were 
not too preposterous a supposition, as if that 
second struggling consciousness were trying to 
announce itself under the high-sounding title of 
— what ? He could not formulate it. If his 
brain wiere only not so confused ! What could 
so suddenly have affected him ? He was always 
so clear-headed and logical. Was he going to 
be ill ? When he reached his desk he sat down 
before it and mechanically took up his pen. He 
leaned his head on his hand, like a man in a state 
of mental exhaustion, and closed his eyes for a 
moment. Then he opened them wide, with an 
exclamation which was almost a cry; and of his 
usual calm repose there was not a trace remaining. 
He leaned forward breathlessly and put his 
pen to the paper. " Her eyes! Her skin! Her 
form! " he muttered uncertainly. " Her — her — 
her — Oh! what is \tl Why cannot I say it ? It 
has come at last — she was right after all — but the 
words — the words — why will not they come? 
The music is there — a great rhythm and harmony 
— but the words are floating about like 



 

wraiths of mist. If I could only grasp and 
crystallize them, and set them to that wonderful 
music, the world — the world would rise at last 
and call me great! Her eyes — her hair — oh, my 
God, what is it?" He threw down his pen and 
staggered to his feet. His face was blanched 
and drawn, and his eyes had lost their steady 
light. He grasped the chair to save himself 
from falling; he had lost over himself both phys- 
ical and mental control. It seemed to him that 
two beings, two distinct entities, were at war 
within his brain — that new, glorious consciousness, 
and a tangible power above, which forced it down 
with an iron hand — down — down — into the depths 
of his mind, where its cries for speech came up 
in faint, inarticulate murmurs. And it tried and 
tried, that strange new thing, to struggle from 
its dungeon and reach the wide, free halls of his 
thought, but it could not; it beat against that 
unrelaxing iron hand only to fall back again and 
again. And it sang and sang and sang, in spite 
of its struggles and captivity. The faint, sweet 
echo came up — if he could but catch the words! 
If he could but dash aside that iron hand, and 
let his brain absorb them ! Surely a word or two 
must force their way — yes! yes! they had come ! 
"Her face! her form!" — He tore open his waist- 
coat; his lungs felt as if they had been ex- 
hausted. Then, how he never knew, he man- 
aged to reach his sofa, and fell face downward 

upon it; and the next morning, when his valet 
came in and drew aside the curtains and let in 
the light of mid-day, he found him there as he 
had fallen. 

III. 

Harold Dartmouth came of a family cele- 
brated throughout its history for producing men 
of marked literary and political ability. Few 
generations had passed without a Dartmouth
distinguishing himself, and those members of the 
family less gifted were not in the habit of having 
their fine intellectual qualities called to account. 
The consequence was that their young descendant, 
who inherited all the family cleverness, although 
as yet he had betrayed the possession of none of 
its higher gifts, paid the penalty of his mental 
patrimony. His brain was abnormally active, 
both through conditions of heredity and personal 
incitement; and the cerebral excitation neces- 
sarily produced^ resulted not infrequently in 
violent reaction, which took the form of protracted 
periods of melancholy. These attacks of 
melancholy had begun during his early school-days, 
when, a remarkably bright but extremely wild boy, 
he had been invariably fired with ambition as
examinations approached, and obliged to cram to 
make up for lost time. As years went by they 
grew with his growth, and few months passed 
without an attack of the blues more or less 
violent, no matter how brief. They came after 
hours of brooding over his desire to distinguish 
himself, and his fatal want of ability; they came 
during his intervals of purely intellectual disgust 
with himself and with life; but more frequently 
still they came upon him from no apparent cause 
whatever. They were a part of his personality, 
just as humor, or light, unthinking gaiety, or a 
constantly bubbling wit may form the predominating 
characteristic of another man. 

For a week after the night of his futile impulse 
to put into shape the nebulous verse which had 
tormented his brain, no one saw Harold Dart- 
mouth. The violent shock and strain had
induced an attack of mental and spiritual depression 
which amounted to prostration, and he lay 
on his sofa taking no notice of the days as they 
slipped by, eating little and speaking to no one. 
At first Jones, his man-servant, was not
particularly disturbed. He had brought Dartmouth up, 
and had come to look upon his moods as a matter 
of course. He therefore confined himself to 
forcing his master to take his food and to parrying 
the curiosity of the French servants; he knew 
Dartmouth's temper too well to venture to call a 
doctor, and he hoped that in a few days the 
mood would wear itself out. But at the end of a 
week he became seriously alarmed. He had 
spent the last day but one in a desperate and 
fruitless attempt to rouse Dartmouth, and had 



 

used every expedient his ingenuity could suggest. 
Finally, at his wits' end, he determined to 
call in the help of Lord Bective Hollington, who 
was Dartmouth's most intimate friend, and had 
lived with him and his moods for months to- 
gether. He came to this decision late on the 
night of the seventh day, and at eleven the next 
morning he presented himself at Hollington's 
apartments in the Rue Lincoln. Hollington was 
still in bed and reading the morning paper, but 
he put it down at once. 

" Send him in," he said. " Something is the 
matter with Harold," he continued to himself. 
" Something unusual has been the matter with 
him all the week, when he wouldn't even see me. 
Well, Jones, what is it ? " as that perturbed 
worthy entered. " You are an early visitor." 

" Oh ! my Lord !" exclaimed Jones, tearfully; 
" something dreadful hails Master 'Arold." 

" What is it ? " demanded Hollington, quickly. 
"Is he ill?" 

Jones shook his head. " No, my Lord; I
