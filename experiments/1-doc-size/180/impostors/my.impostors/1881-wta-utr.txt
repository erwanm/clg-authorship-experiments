misunderstanding about the matter."

"You saw me write the card at the post-office last night, Captain
Alick: and I sent it off by the young man who was with you."

"Yes, sir; Nick Boomsby took the card; and I have no doubt he delivered
it, for he came on board of the Sylvania towards night.

"I think Captain Blastblow intends to return soon," I added, for I
could not think of any explanation of his singular conduct. I certainly
could not reason out any plausible occasion for such a violation of his
orders as that in which he seemed to be engaged.

"Perhaps he has run off with the yacht, and intends to become a pirate,
or something of that sort," suggested Gus Shepard.

"Nonsense, my son! The Islander is not an armed vessel, and Captain
Blastblow is not a pirate," replied Colonel Shepard. "Do you suppose
anything was out of order on board of the steamer, Captain Alick?"

"It is possible; but if such was the case, the captain would hardly
have gone so far down the river," I replied. "If the Islander had
needed any more repairs, Captain Blastblow would have remained in
Jacksonville and attended to them."

"Perhaps he wishes to become better acquainted with the vessel before
he takes her to sea," added the colonel.

"He might have done that yesterday. He would not have waited until you
were ready to sail, and then gone off on an experimental cruise," I
answered.

"An experimental cruise!" exclaimed Owen. "What a terrible expression.
I hope Captain Blastblow don't use such expressions. If he does, he has
gone out to sea where he can have room enough to unsnarl his tongue."

"Captain Blastblow is an American, and he is used to such little
trials," I replied.

"What shall be done?" asked Colonel Shepard.

"I think you had better go on board of the Sylvania, with your baggage,
and we will stand down the river," I replied, promptly, for I had kept
this idea in my mind for some time. "We can at least follow the
Islander, and when we come up with her you can go on board of her."

"Are you sure you can overtake her, Captain Alick?" asked Colonel
Shepard, with a smile, as though he had some doubts in regard to the
relative speed of the two steam-yachts. "Captain Blastblow is confident
that he can outsail the Sylvania."

"I don't say that he cannot; but if he does, he has learned a new trick
in handling her," I answered, with energy. "I have sailed the Sylvania
against the Islander on the Great Lakes more than once, and have not
found the time when I could not beat her."

"Her new captain claims to be a very skilful man in handling steamers,"
added the colonel.

"If you and your family will come on board, sir, I will do the best I
can to overtake the Islander, and ascertain what the conduct of her
captain means. If we have anything like fair play, we shall overhaul
the Islander sometime to-day," I continued, confidently. "We are both
well down in the water, with our coal-bunkers and water-tanks full. She
is nearly an hour ahead of us now, and her captain was hurrying her all
he could."

Owen was delighted with the decision of Colonel Shepard when he
accepted my invitation. He had regained his divinity, and he conducted
her on board of the Sylvania, while the colonel assisted Mrs. Shepard.
Owen escorted Miss Edith to the pilot-house, and her mother went down
into the cabin, for the morning was rather raw and chilly. Margie took
her dear friend to her heart, and hoped the Sylvania would never
overtake the Islander.

"You must let the other steamer keep ahead, Captain Alick," said
Margie, as I took my place at the wheel, when the baggage had been put
on board.

"That would be treason to the Sylvania and treason to Colonel Shepard,"
I replied, as I rang the bell to start the steamer.

I knew the river well enough to go ahead confidently, and I had given
the chief-engineer a hint as to what I expected of him. In a few
minutes, the little steamer was buzzing along at the rate of eleven
miles an hour. The only thing I feared was fog, and there seemed to be
great banks of it off in the direction of the mouth of the river.

"Mr. Washburn," I called through the windows in front of me.

"On deck, sir," replied the mate.

"Call all hands, and set the fore-topsail."

"Ay, ay, sir," responded Washburn; and I knew there would be no lack of
zeal on his part when we came to an out-and-out race.

All hands usually consisted of the two deck hands; but Ben Bowman, the
second fireman, and the cabin-waiter were available when there was any
extra work to be done. Buck Lingley and Hop Tossford, the deck hands,
were sent aloft by the mate to loose sails, while the others manned the
halyard and the braces. In a very short time the topsail was drawing
full, and the speed of the vessel was sensibly increased.

"Mr. Washburn!" I called again.

"On deck, sir," responded the mate.

"Set the foresail."

The crew made quick work of it.

"Now the mainsail, Mr. Washburn," I continued.

The wind was quite fresh, and the fore and aft sails caused the steamer
to heel over considerably when the puffs came, as they generally do in
a south-westerly breeze.

"You will tip us over, Captain Alick!" cried Miss Margie, who had not
been at sea in the Sylvania.

"I won't do anything of the kind, Miss Tiffany," I replied, with a
laugh. "I shall not drown myself for the sake of drowning you, I am
very sure. Mr. Washburn!"

"On deck, sir."

"Set the fore to'gallant sail."

"Ay, ay, sir," chuckled the mate, who understood that I meant business
by this time.

"Pray, which is the fore top-gallant sail, Captain Alick?" asked Miss
Margie.

"It is the highest sail we set on the foremast, though larger vessels
have a royal above that, then a skysail," I replied. "Mr. Washburn!"

"On deck, sir."

"Now give us the fore squaresail, and run up the jib."

The last order was to set the main gaff-topsail; and then we had all
sail on. We turned the bend of the river just after the last sail had
been set, which gave us the wind over the starboard quarter. I was
confident we were making twelve knots an hour, and the skilful firing
of Philander Perkins soon made her do even better than this. The water
fairly roared at the bow as the vessel cut through it. The young ladies
in the pilot-house ceased to talk, and Miss Margie held on at the wheel
with both hands. It was lively sailing, but there was no danger, and I
told the fair maiden so many times.



We all kept a sharp lookout for the Islander, but as yet we saw nothing
of her. She had, at least, ten miles the start of us, and it was likely
to be a long chase, if she continued on her course. I wanted very much
to get a sight of her when we reached the bar at the mouth of the St.
Johns, so as to determine what course she took.

No progress whatever had been made in solving the problem of the
Islander's sudden departure without her owner and passengers. We could
not imagine any motive on the part of her captain for his singular
conduct. My father and Colonel Shepard talked about the matter all the
time; but in the absence of any data they could not get ahead a
particle.

In an hour and a half by the watch we were in sight of the bar. The
weather looked thick and nasty outside, and there was not the slightest
sign of the Islander. But we were still in the river, and our view to
the north and south was obstructed by the trees and shrubs on the
shores. It was plain enough to me by this time that Captain Blastblow
had no intention of returning to Jacksonville for his passengers.

I kept the Sylvania on her course over the bar, and, as it was full
tide, I had no fear of taking the bottom. We kept on our course till we
had made a good offing. Though the fog had not settled down near the
bar, vast piles of it were floating in the air. The question now was
whether the Islander had gone to the north or the south. I had given
the wheel to Hop Tossford, and I was using the glass very industriously
