"Well, I never!" cried Mrs. Balberry. "Did you ever hear of such a
swindle!"

"They play all sorts of games in a big city like this. You've got to
keep your eyes open."

"I know it," groaned Abner Balberry. "Yesterday, a cabman cheated me out
o' fifty cents, an' a boy got a quarter from me by a bogus telegram. I
thought something had happened to hum, and when I opened the telegram it
had nuthin but a sheet o' blank paper inside!"

"That was too bad."

There was an awkward pause. Now that the farmer had found Nat he hardly
knew what to say. He had expected to upbraid his nephew for running
away, but the pocketbook episode rather flustered him.

"So you come to New York, didn't you?" he said, slowly.

"Yes."

"Are you working?"

"Yes, and I've got a pretty good job, too."

"What at?"

"I'm in an office downtown."

"How much do you git?"

"What do you think, Uncle Abner?"

"About two or three dollars a week."

"I get seven dollars a week."

"Seven dollars a week--fer a boy!"

"You have been very lucky," put in Mrs. Balberry. "I wish Fred could
strike a job like that."

"I'm to have a raise later on," added Nat.

"It wasn't right fer you to run away, Nat," continued his uncle.

"There are two ways of looking at it."

"An' you had no right to set fire to the barn."

"I never did that, Uncle Abner. I wouldn't be so mean."

"And you sold thet cow."

"She was my cow."

"No, she wasn't!"

"I say she was, and I can prove it!"

"Well, we won't quarrel about the cow. What I want to know is, are you
behavin' yourself here in the city?"

"I am. I work every day, and I board with some very nice people."

"Ain't squanderin' your earnin's on theaters an' sech?"

"No, I have never seen the inside of a theater."

"Maybe you ain't seen the inside of a church either," came from Mrs.
Balberry.

"Yes, I go to church every Sunday."

"Then you don't want to go back to the farm?" came from Abner Balberry.

"No, I am never going back there."

"Don't you know that I am your guardeen?"

"That may be so, Uncle Abner, but I am not going back to the farm."

"You'll go if I say so!"

"No, I won't!" and Nat's eyes flashed fire. "I'm going to support
myself, and all I ask is to be let alone."

"Oh, leave him stay, Abner," broke in Mrs. Balberry. "You don't want
him, now you have Fred."

The farmer was on the point of saying that Nat as a worker was worth two
Freds, but he thought it best to keep silent on that point.

"I'd like to make certain you are stopping with decent folks," said he,
after another pause.

"And you won't bother me if I can prove that?" cried our hero, eagerly.

"I guess so, Nat. But you mustn't come down on me fer board an' clothes,
later on."

"I won't."

The matter was talked over for a few minutes longer, and in the end Nat
led the way to his boarding house and introduced his uncle and Mrs.
Balberry to Mrs. Talcott. The surroundings rather pleased Abner
Balberry, and he ended by arranging to stay with Mrs. Talcott for
several days.

"It's better'n them hotels," said the farmer. "It's more like hum, ain't
it, Lucy?"

"Yes, but it ain't quite so high-toned," said the bride, who was
inclined to cut a dash whenever the opportunity afforded.




CHAPTER XIX

NAT BECOMES A PRIVATE CLERK


Abner Balberry and his bride remained in New York four days longer, and
during that time Nat did all in his power to make their visit a pleasant
one. He received Mr. Garwell's permission to remain away from work one
day, and took his uncle and aunt to Central Park, and to the Brooklyn
Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty. They were greatly pleased, and were
frank enough to tell Nat so.

"I guess you are more cut out for the city than for the farm," said
Abner to his nephew. "I hope you do well. You must write to us often,
an' some day you must pay us a visit."

"I certainly will do that, Uncle Abner," said Nat, and then, to please
the bride, he purchased for her a souvenir book, containing many
illustrations of the metropolis. This book Mrs. Balberry prized highly,
and from that moment she began to like Nat.

"He ain't half so bad as I was led to expect," she said, on the way
home. "He seems to know what he is doing."

"He certainly is gettin' along," responded Abner. "Shouldn't wonder but
what he'll be a regular business man some day."

"Do you think it would pay to send Fred down to the city?"

"No, he better stay on the farm. Fred ain't got the way about him thet
Nat's got."

"He's just as smart," said the youth's mother, quickly.

"Maybe, but he ain't got the knack o' it."

"He would do just as well if he had the chance," continued Mrs.
Balberry. As was perhaps natural she thought her own son as good as any
boy.

On the day after Nat's uncle left New York John Garwell called the boy
into his private office.

"Did you arrange matters with Mr. Balberry?" he asked, pleasantly.

"Yes, sir. He is going to leave me alone after this," and our hero
smiled.

"I am glad to hear it, Nat. Then there is nothing in the way of your
continuing here."

"No, sir."

"In that case I want to ask you a question. How would you like to take
up stenography and typewriting?"

"I'd like it first-rate, if I thought I could do anything with them
after I had learned them."

"I would like to have a private secretary who understood stenography,
and the use of the typewriter."
