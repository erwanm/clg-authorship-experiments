just speaking of the great victory which the Lutherans under General Torstensohn had fought for 
and gained at Leipzig; and the house-father was 
giving his opinion that soon now surely enough 
blood would have flowed, and that peace must be 
near. Upon that came his neighbour hastily in 
and said, " Neighbour, hurry and loose your cattle, and let us flee to the wood; the emperor's 
forces are only half an hour off." Quick everybody sprang up ; the cattle were muzzled to prevent their bellowing; the few bits of clothing and 
some victuals were caught up ; and away they went 
plunging into the thickest part of the forest, as fast 
and as noiselessly as they could. Hinz closed the 
procession, and when the cattle were got out of 
sight he took post behind a tree, that he might see 



 

what the soldiers would do. He had not long to 
watch; for it was scarcely a quarter of an hour 
later that bright flames went crackling up into the 
sky; both houses together with the outbuildings 
were in a blaze. The soldiers were enraged that 
they had found no booty, and had set fire to everything. Hinz hastened now into the thick of the 
wood after the others, and when he caught up with 
them he told them of their misfortune. With that, 
they all fell upon their knees and thanked God that 
he had saved their lives and their cattle; and it 
never came into any one's head to weep so much 
as a single tear; they could build huts for them 
selves in the wood; and their hearts did not hang 
upon things of this world. But what is this? what 
could all of a sudden force such a deep sigh from 
Father Drewes that it absolutely startled them all? 
what could bring great tears into the eyes of that 
strong man, whom nobody had ever seen weep before? "Godfather Hinz," he said with his voice 
half stifled with pain, "our books! our books! 
Ah, they are burnt up by now! our own and 
our children's only treasure and comfort ! " And 
behold, they all then fell to weeping, men and 
women and children, men and maids, as if their 
hearts would break. At last spoke out the old 
Father Hinz, an eighty-years-old grey-headed man, 
" Hush, children ! if our books are burned, our 
God and Saviour is not gone with them; we have 
him in our hearts ; and his word we have too, not 
only in the Bible but in our memories. I will say 



 

out a chapter for you every morning and very 
evening, out of my heart." Then they grew quiet, 
and he folded his hands and began at once, and 
prayed first the twenty-third psalm, and then the 
seventy-third psalm, and finally the eighth chapter 
of the epistle to the Romans; all verse for verse from 
the beginning to the end.'" 

" The twenty-third and the seventy-third ? " said 
Maggie interrupting. " Which are they ? " 

"Don't you know? The twenty -third begins, 
'The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.'" 

" And it goes on, " said Mr. Murray, " ' He 
prepareth a table before me in the presence of mine 
enemies; he anointeth my head with oil; my cup 
runneth over.' " 

" Not very appropriate," said Flora. 

" I thought, very appropriate." 

"Why they were just in great want, sir; even 
of the most ordinary comforts." 

" A good time to remind themselves of their extraordinary comforts." 

" What had they, to justify them in talking of 
their 4 cup running over ' ? " 

"Something which they know who know, Miss 
Flora, and other people would try in vain to com 
prehend." 

"Well, the other word, 'I shall not want;' they 
were in want already." 

"No," said Meredith, "excuse me. I have read 
what comes after." 

" They were in want, Ditto, certainly." 



 

" Only such want Never mind, I will not forestall my story." 

" What is the other psalm ? " Flora asked. 

"Very beautiful in this connection," said Mr. 
Murray, who had got out his Bible. " It begins, 
 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are 
of a clean heart.'" 

" There again ! " said Flora, " What reason had 
they just then to think that he was good?" 

"That is faith, Miss Flora." 

" Faith ? " the young lady repeated. 

"Yes. Faith takes on trust, when it cannot see." 

Flora looked at the speaker. 

" The psalm goes on to describe the temptations 
to doubt which had beset the psalmist on observing the prosperity of wicked people and the hard times the Lord's people often had ; and then how he 
saw his mistake ; and then he breaks out, Whom 
have I in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon 
earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my 
heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, 
and my portion forever.' " 

"That is beautiful, and appropriate," said Flora. 

"As soon as a man gets where he can say 'Thou 
shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory,' he can stand a few ups and 
downs in this life. The choice of passages made 
by that old man was beautiful in the extreme ; and 
proved not only that he knew the Bible, but that 
it was part of his life." 

"And the chapter of Romans?" 



 

" A worthy third in the trio. That is a chapter 
of triumph in the Christian's privilege and hopes, 
ending 'Who shall separate us from the love of 
Christ ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, 
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . v . 
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquer 
ors, through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor 
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor 
things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any 
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the 
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' " 

Flora's eyes filled, and she said nothing; and 
Meredith took up his book again. 

" There is another word in that chapter that fits, 
sir;  All things shall work together for good to 
them that love God.'" 

 ' It would certainly take faith to believe that" 
said Flora. " I can imagine a little that other things 
and hopes might console people suffering trouble 
in their persons and goods; but now, for instance, 
what possible benefit could it be to those people 
to have their houses burned, and to be driven 
into the wild wood with no shelter and nothing 
or very little to eat, and likewise very little to 
put on?" 

" Well, T had better read," said Meredith. ' Pastor Harms stops there, after telling how old Drewes 
recited Scripture, and asks, 4 Could my dear readers 
all of them have done as much ? just ask yourselves 
once quietly ; and whoever is forced to say, " I could 



 

not do it," let him be ashamed from the bottom of
