Yet Mrs. Varick's dinner-party was a success. Under 
other circumstances I should have enjoyed it wonderfully. 
I could not help being pleased as it was. To be appre- 
ciated in such a genial, delicate fashion, to know that I 
could still attract and interest, was indeed gratifying. And 
there was just the company to be mutually entertaining. 
Art and literature were discussed without pedantry. Most 
of those assembled had travelled, and visited the rich gal- 
leries of the old world. In spite of the dull pain at my 
heart, my spirits rose. I knew that my cheeks warmed 
and my eyes grew luminous. 

Some time after we had returned to the drawing-room, 
Mrs. Lawrence and I floated together again. She was all 
ease and grace, as usual. 

" How very little you have changed ! " she said. " I have 
so often wondered if I should ever see you again, and I feel 
now as if I could scold you heartily for keeping away from 
Laurelwood. Do you not know that we should have been 
most glad to see you ? " 



 

She might, but Mr. St. John ? 

" Stuart will be so surprised ! We came to New York 
without him, AS he had some pressing business on hand. 
Elsie is so extravagantly fond of operas, and he didn't 
want her to miss one of the season." 

" Your niece ? " I said, inquiringly. 

"Yes. Mr. Lawrence's sister married a Spaniard, you 
know. Elsie was her only child, and after her death, Mr. 
Carme married a second time. Stuart grew wonderfully 
interested in this child when he was in Cuba, and upon a 
second visit, some eighteen months ago, brought her home. 
She is the most charming little being you can imagine. 
I love her as if she were my own." 

A sharp pang went to my heart. After all, why should 
it matter to me what course Mr. St. John's interest took? 
And yet all the old days rushed back, times when his 
approval and smile had been so much to me. 

She chatted on. I had become a successful authoress, 
which did not at all surprise her ; she had always fancied 
me peculiar. And I had really found some relatives 
Mrs. Varick had been relating the singular circumstances. 
Some friends of Laura's were boarding at the same hotel 
with them, and the meeting of a few days before had been 
purely accidental. Mrs. Lawrence had asked if there were 
any tidings of me, and Laura had mentioned the fact of 
her call, and the intended dinner-party. 

I felt easier when I heard this, though I found it would 
be impossible to avoid them now. I must summon all 
my courage. And I confess that after I had talked with 
Miss Carme, a strange desire took possession of me to 
know more of her. How extraordinarily lovely and fasci- 
nating she was! Gerald was as deeply interested in her as 
I ; his face beamed with intense satisfaction. 

The evening passed rapidly and pleasantly. Mr. St. 





John's arrival had been given up by his sister, and my 
nervous apprehension was over. In a room at the end of 
the hall some of the younger members of the party had 
been waltzing. I watched Gerald and Miss Carme until 
my brain was in a maze. Indeed they attracted nearly 
every one's attention by the bewildering grace of their 
movements. Was Gerald absolutely fascinated ? I had 
never seen such a light in his eyes. 

Some impulse drew me away. It was too fateful to 
linger over. I turned and walked through the cool hall, 
and had just reached the staircase, when I paused, spell- 
bound. Mr. St. John stood before me I 

"Does the feud last a lifetime?" he said, with his 
peculiar smile. "Have I offended you so deeply that you 
will not even speak or shake hands?" 

I reached mine towards him ; but it was cold and 
trembling. 

" I confess this meeting is altogether unexpected," he 
continued, with a touch of embarrassment. "You have 
seen my sister?" 

She came at that moment, and then the hall seemed 
suddenly to fill. Mrs. Varick pressed forward, and there 
was a sound of welcome. I mingled with the throng ; 
but I heard no voice save his. He was explaining the 
detention of a train ; then he and Mrs. Varick had a little 
badinage. 

Here is an old friend by a new name," she said, as soon 
as she reached my vicinity. "Miss Clifford." 

He looked sharply at me. " I don't know that I ever 
remember a name changed in that manner," he said, 
pointedly. 

" Changed for a fortune instead of love," Mrs. Varick 
answered, gayly. 

Had he heard the absurd rurnor, too ? "Well, he would 



 

soon know, for I had told Mrs. Lawrence the particulars 
of the strange story. 

"O, you have come?" Miss Carme exclaimed, her eyes 
absolutely bewildering in their radiant light, and her face 
flushed with warmth and excitement. 

" Yes, at the eleventh hour. Have you enjoyed your- 
self?" 

" O, so much ! And I've been waltzing while the rest 
talked." 

Such a light, musical laugh! I thought I had never 
heard anything so tenderly beguiling in all my life. 

He gave her a fond glance, so quick that none besides 
us saw it. But her eyes replied, and perhaps my heart. 

I looked around for 'Gerald, and proposed returning 
home. I fancied he would rather have staid, but he 
assented. Then I was besieged for calls and promises of 
various kinds ; and the regrets expressed were extremely 
flattering, to say the least. 

I remember finding my way up the stairs to the dress- 
ing-room in a strange, absent manner, as if my soul had 
gone out of me. Then adieus were said, and Gerald 
handed me into the carriage. We scarcely spoke during 
our homeward drive; and if I had not been so absorbed 
in my own reflections, I must have noticed his reticence. 

At last I laid my throbbing head on my pillow. All 
my hardest lessons to learn over again. O God, would I, 
could I, ever forget ? 



 



CHAPTER xxiv. 

" Therefore disturbing dreams 

Trouble the secret streams 
And founts of music that o'erflow my breast; 

Something far more divine, 

Than may on enrlh be mine, 
Haunts my worn heart, und will not let me rest." 

AFTER that night I was in a whirl of society. I had 
preserved a tolerable seclusion before ; but now I found 
myself invaded at every point. It was gratifying to be 
thus sought by people whose regard was worth cultivat- 
ing ; indeed, whose attention was the finest compliment
