Mr. St. John wrote that the business was much more 
complicated than he supposed, and that he was unable to 
fix upon any period of return, but that it would be as 
speedy as circumstances would permit. We were rather 
quiet, for Mrs. Lawrence left me much to my own devices. 
In this mood of brooding repose a tiny flame of ambition 
sprang up. Mr. St. John had satirically said write a 
book. Have we not all a thread of romance within us? 
And so I began. 

How the days passed I scarcely remember. They were 
like dreams perfected by sweetest music. I neither looked 
forward nor backward, but simply waited. 



 

Suddenly the music censed ; the spell was broken, 

My eyes were wandering carelessly over the paper one 
morning as we still lingered in the breakfast-room, when 
my attention was suddenly arrested by the announcement 
of the failure of a large New York and Baltimore house, 
and the suicide of one of the partners. My fortune was 
swept away at a single blow ! 

I sat there in silence. When the fire has burned to 
ashes, one does not look for a torch to rekindle it. There 
must be wood to sustain a new flame. The old has per- 
ished beyond recall. 

"What is the matter, Sydnie ?" and I saw Mrs. Law- 
rence making a siufden movement towards me. "You are 
as pale as a ghost." 

" A poor way to bear misfortune; " and my lip quivered, 
failing miserably in an attempt at a smile. 

"Misfortune?" Her tone was incredulous. 

I handed her the paper. 

" An utter failure J O, it cannot be quite true. These 
things are always abominably exaggerated. How unfor- 
tunate that Stuart is away! I will send for Mr. Northrnp 
he may know how to advise;" and she did despatch 
a servant immediately for the county lawyer. 

We walked slowly through the hall. It was a warm, 
morning; but the fragrant air revived me. 

" My poor child, I cannot express my sorrow nor my 
sympathy. I only hope we shall not find it as bad as we 
expect." 

What did I expect ? Literally nothing. I felt crushed 
and overwhelmed. I cannot say that I had ever experi- 
enced any strong love for poverty, and now I shrank from 
the crisis with a trembling in every nerve. Very weak 
and ignoble perhaps, but I could not help it. 

Mr. Northrup was not at home ; and two days elapsed 



 

before he made his appearance. By this time the first 
accounts had become well authenticated. The old story 
of extravagant living, speculation, inevitable disgrace, and 
death. My sympathies were strangely interested in behalf 
of the family so suddenly plunged into deepest gloom. 

" My dear," Mrs. Lawrence said, in her sweetest tone, 
"if you only had married Aylmer. He would never have 
thought twice of the loss." 

My lip curled involuntarily. 

"I think it would be best to take a little trip north. 
Your outfit of last winter can be made beautifully availa- 
ble with very little expense ; and few will know of the 
misfortune. You still have your beauty." 

"No," I said, decisively, "I cannot take part in such a 
farce." 

" What will you do then ? " 

" Give music lessons or teach school," I answered, reck- 
lessly. 

" Sydnie, I beg you will not do anything rash nor fool- 
ish. You have many friends, and sufiicient attraction yet 
to make a good marriage. Look at the matter sensibly, 
now, I implore you. I have decided to go to Washington 
next winter, and I want you to feel that you would be 
most welcome to my care. I am sure that you can not 
only retrieve your fortune, but make yourself happy. You 
will marry sometime." 

She did not in the least suspect Mr. St. John of caring 
for me. But in her opinion poverty was a kind of pesti- 
lence that it was proper to take any method to be rid of. 
I felt proud and defiant. Would Mr. St. John deem me 
capable of mercenary motives ? 

Mr. Northrup found affairs in the wildest confusion. 
The first reports were but too true. 

" It is not worth while to wony Stuart with it," Mrs. 



 

Lawrence said. " He will be home soon, and then his 
hearing cannot mend matters. He will regret the unfor- 
tunate occurrence deeply." 

I hardly knew how I felt about Mr. St. John. Pride 
and delicacy revolted from making the slightest appeal to 
him. All the little tendernesses- I had planned, and the 
ready compliance I was to show, looked too much like 
interest. He could make my path very smooth in the 
manner pointed out by Mrs. Lawrence, The thought 
gave me an uncomfortable shiver. 

To please her I had gone on as usual. We had received 
an invitation to a birthnight party of a young lady, one 
of our neighbors, and a person I really admired. When I 
found that she expected me to accompany her, I made no 
demur; indeed, I anticipated much pleasure. Mrs. Darrell, 
the girl's mother, had been extremely sympathetic and 
cordial to me ; and I felt that no loss of fortune would 
ever change her regard for one she liked. 

The preparations roused me a little, brought me back 
to a more human state, I resolved to enjoy the gayeties 
with as much of the old zest as possible. 

"How bright and lovely you look!" Mrs. Lawrence 
said ; and I felt pleased with her commendation. 

It was indeed a gala scene; the lawn hung with.colored 
lanterns, and everywhere a profusion of fragrant flowers. 
Great wreaths of roses swaying in the soft June air> and 
the walks lined with blossoming shrubs of every variety, 
the porches covered, and the rooms decorated. How 
lovely it appeared ! and to make the enchantment more 
complete, musicians had been stationed in different parts 
of the ground, and sweet melodies went wandering through 
many a woodland path.. 

I felt my spirits rising. I knew I looked well. Why 
should I be shut out of enjoyment through a loss brought 
 



 

about by no fault of my own ? Was I not the same ? and 
did I not possess capabilities that had been mine a month 
ago ? My fortune had taken away no integral part of 
myself. 

They danced, chatted, laughed, and made themselves 
merry. The evening was half spent, perhaps, when I 
sauntered down a path, attracted by a strain of sweet 
melody the flutes and French horns were blowing out in 
tremulous summer gales. Then a voice near me said, 

" So Miss Adriance has lost her fortune. What will she do?" 

" Mrs. Lawrence is very fond of her. I suppose she will 
remain at Laurelwood, as she has no relatives," a voice that 
I recognized made answer.
