rides.  Wasn't it a fine world?  It was, indeed.

Once they stopped at a farm.  The girl refused to dismount, bidding Max
go in and ask for a drink of milk.  Max obeyed with alacrity, returning
with two foaming goblets of warm milk.

From time to time the princess stifled the "small voice."  It was
wrong, and yet it wasn't.  What worried her was the thought that Betty
might take it into her head to follow, and then everything would be
spoiled.  Every now and then she turned her head and sighed
contentedly; the road to rearward was always clear.

"Follow me!" she cried suddenly, even daringly.

A stone wall, three feet high, ran along at their right.  The
foreground was hard and firm.  Pressing the reins on the filly's
withers, she made straight for the wall, cleared it, and drew up on the
other side.  Now, Max hadn't the least idea that the horse under him
was a hunter, so I might very well say that he took his life in his
hands as he followed her.  But Dandy knew his business.  He took the
wall without effort.  A warm glow went over Max when he found that he
hadn't broken his neck.  Together they galloped down the field and came
back for the return jump.  This, too, was made easily.  Max's
admiration knew no bounds.  It was a dangerous pastime in more ways
than one.

At eight o'clock they turned toward home, talking about another
thousand and one things.

"It has been a delightful ride," suggested Max, with an eye to the
future.

"I take this road nearly every morning," said she, looking out upon the
water, which was ruffling itself and quarreling along the sandy shores.

Max said nothing, but he at once made up his mind that he would take
the same road, provided he could in any reasonable manner get rid of me.


"Did you enjoy the ride?" asked the Honorable Betty, as her Highness
came in to breakfast.  There were no formalities in the princess'
apartments.

"Beautifully!"  Her Highness guiltily wondered if there was any logical
way to keep Betty in the house for the next few mornings.  She sat down
and sipped her tea.  "The duke talked to me last night.  Steinbock
played double."

"What!"

"Yes.  He sold us to the duke, who patiently waited for me to speak.
Betty, I am a fool.  But I shall never marry Doppelkinn.  That is
settled."

"I suppose he will be inviting me to return to England," said Betty
shrewdly.

"Not for the present."

"And I have just grown to love the place,"--pathetically.  "Mr.
Warrington has asked me to ride with him afternoons.  His ankle
prevents him from taking the long morning jaunts.  If it will not
interfere with your plans, dear--"

"Accept, by all means," interrupted her Highness.  "He is a capital
horseman."  She smiled mysteriously.  Happily her companion was
absorbed in thought and did not see this smile.


Max came in at quarter of ten, went to tub, and came down in time for
the eggs.

"Have a good ride?" I asked.

"Bully!  Beautiful country!"  He was enthusiastic.

"How these healthy animals eat!" I thought as I observed him
occasionally.

"Wish I could go with you," I said, but half-heartedly.

"I'll get the lay of the land quick enough," he replied.

The rascal!  Not a word about the girl that morning, or the next, or
until Thursday morning.  If only I had known!  But Fate knows her
business better than I do, and she was handling the affair.  But long
rides of a morning with a pretty girl are not safe for any bachelor.

Thursday morning he came in late.  He dropped something on the table.
On inspection I found it to be a woman's handkerchief purse.

"Where the deuce did you get that?" I asked, mighty curious.

"By George!  but I've been enjoying the most enchanting adventure; such
as you read out of a book.  I'm inclined to believe that I shall enjoy
my studies in old Barscheit."

"But where did you get this?"  If there was a girl around, I wanted to
know all about it.

"She dropped it."

"She dropped it!" I repeated.  "What she?  Why, you old tow-head,
have you been flirting at this hour of the morning?"

"Handsome as a picture!"

"Ha! the ideal at last,"--ironically.  "Blonde, of course."

"Dark as a Spaniard, and rides like Diana."  His enthusiasm was not to
be lightly passed over.

"Never heard of Diana riding," said I; "always saw her pictured as
going afoot."

"Don't be an ass!  You know very well what I mean."

"I've no argument to offer, nor any picture to prove my case.  You've
had an adventure; give it up, every bit of it."

"One of the finest horsewomen I ever saw.  Took a wall three feet high
the other morning, just to see if I dared follow.  Lucky Dandy is a
hunter, or I'd have broken my neck."

"Very interesting."  Then of a sudden a thought flashed through my head
and out again.  "Anybody with her?"

"Only myself these three mornings."

"H'm!  Did you get as far as names?"

"Yes; I told her mine.  Who is Hildegarde von Heideloff?"

"Heideloff?"  I was puzzled.  My suspicions evaporated.  "I can't say
that I know any one by that name.  Sure it was Heideloff?"

"Do you mean to tell me," with blank astonishment, "that there is a
petticoat on horseback in this duchy that you do not know?"

"I don't know any woman by the name of Hildegarde von Heideloff; on my
word of honor, Max, I don't."

"Old Bauer, the blacksmith, knew her."

Bauer?  All my suspicions returned.  "Describe the girl to me."

"Handsome figure, masses of black hair, great black eyes that are full
of good fun, a delicate nose, and I might add, a very kissable mouth."

"What! have you kissed her?" I exclaimed.

"No, no!  Only, I'd like to."

"H'm!  You've made quite a study.  She must be visiting some one
near-by.  There is an old castle three miles west of the smithy.  Did
she speak English?"

"Yes,"--excitedly.

"That accounts for it.  An old English nobleman lives over there during
the summer months, and it is not improbable that she is one of his
guests."  In my heart I knew that her Highness was up to some of her
tricks again, but there was no need of her shattering good old Max's
heart.  Yet I felt bound to say: "Why not look into the purse?  There
might be something there to prove her identity."

"Look into her purse?"--horrified.  "You wouldn't have me peeping into
a woman's purse, would you?  Suppose there should be a box of rouge?
Her cheeks were red."

"Quite likely."

"Or a powder-puff."

"Even more likely."

"Or--"

"Go on."
