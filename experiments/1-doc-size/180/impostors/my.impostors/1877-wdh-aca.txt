man, the love she shows to me because I 'in like 
somebody else, I must play the brute. But have a 
little mercy on me. At least, I 'm a baited brute. 
I don't know which way to turn, I don't know 
what to do. She 's so dear to me, so dear in 
every tone of her voice, every look of her eyes, 
every aspiration or desire of her transparent soul, 
that it seems to me my whole being is nothing but 
a thought of her. I loved her helplessness, her 
pallor, her sorrow ; judge how I adore her return 
to something like life ! Oh, you blame me ! You 
simplify this infernal perplexity of mine and label 
it brutality, and scold me for it. Great heaven ! 
And yet you saw, you heard how she entered this 
room. In that instant the old illusion was back 
on her, and I was nothing. All that I had been 
striving and longing to be to her, and hoping and 
despairing to seem, was swept out of existence ; I 
was reduced to a body without a soul, to a shadow, 
a counterfeit! You think I resented it? Poor 
girl, I pitied her so ; and my own heart all the 



 

time like lead in my breast, a dull lump of ache! 
I swear, I wonder I don't go mad. I suppose 
why, I suppose I am insane. No man in his senses 
was ever bedeviled by such a maniacal hallucina- 
tion. Look here, Cummings: tell me that this 
damnable coil isn't simply a matter of my own 
fancy. It'll be some little relief to know that it's 
real. 

Cummings: "It's real enough, my dear fellow. 
And it is a trial, more than I could have be- 
lieved such a fantastic thing could be." 

Bartlett: " Trial? Ordeal by fire! Torment! I 
can't stand it any longer." 

Cumminys, musingly : " She is beautiful, isn't 
she, with that faint dawn of red in her cheeks, 
not a color, but a colored light like the light that 
hangs round a rose-tree's boughs in the early 
spring! And what a magnificent movement, what 
a stately grace ! The girl must have been a god- 
dess!" 

Bartlett: "And now she's a saint for sweet- 
ness and patience! You think she 's had nothing 
to suffer before from me ? You know me better ! 
Well, I 'm going away." 



 

Cummings: Perhaps it will be the best. You 
can go back with me to-morrow." 

Bartlett: "To morrow? Go back with you to- 
morrow? What are you talking about, man?" 
Cummings smiles. "I can't go to-morrow. I 
can't leave her hating me." --. 

Cummin gs: " I knew you never meant to go. 
Well, what will you do ? " 

Bartlett: "Don't be so cold-blooded! What 
would you do ? " 

Cummings: "I would have it out, somehow." 

Bartlett : " Oh, you talk ! How ? " 

Cummings: "I am not in love with Miss 
Wyatt." 

Bartlett : " Oh, don't try to play the cynic with 
me ! It doesn't become you. I know I Ve used 
you badly at times, Cummings. I behaved abomi- 
nably in leaving you to take the brunt of meeting 
General Wyatt that first day ; I said so then, and 
f shall always say it. But I thought you had for- 
given that." 

Cummings, with a laugh : " You make it hard to 
treat you seriously, Bartlett. What do you want 



 

me to do ? Do you want me to go to Miss Wyatt, 
and explain your case to her?" 

Bartlett, angrily: "No!" 

Gumming s : "Perhaps to Mrs. Wyatt?" 

Bartlett, infuriate : " No ! " 
, Cummings : " To the General ? " 

Bartlett, with sudden quiet: "You had better 
go away from here, Cummings while you can." 

Cummings : " I see you don't wish me to do 
anything, and you 're quite right. Nobody can do 
anything but yourself." 

Bartlett : " And what would you advise me to 
do?" 

Cummings: "I've told you that I would have 
it out. You can't make matters worse. You can't 
go on in this way indefinitely. It's just possible 
that you might find yourself mistaken, that Miss 
Wyatt cares for you in your own proper identity." 

Bartlett: "For shame!" 

Cummings: "Oh, if you like!" 

Bartlett, after a pause: "Would you would 
you see the General?" 

Cummings: "If I wanted to marry the General. 



 

Come, Bartlett; don't be ridiculous. You know 
you don't want my advice, and I haven't any to 
give. I must go to my room a moment." 

Bartlett: "Well, go! You're of no advantage 
here. You 'd have it out, would you ? Well, then, 
I wouldn't. I 'm a brute, I know, and a fool, but 
I 'm not such a brute and fool as that ! " Cum- 
mings listens with smiling patience, and then goes 
without reply, while Bartlett drops into the chair 
near the easel, and sulkily glares at the picture. 
Through the window at his back shows the mel- 
low Indian summer landscape. The trees have all 
dropped their leaves, save the oaks which show 
their dark crimson banners among the deep green 
of the pines and hemlocks on the hills; the mead- 
ows, verdant as in June, slope away toward the 
fringe of birches and young maples along the 
borders of the pond ; the low-blackberry trails like 
a running fire over the long grass limp from the 
first frosts, which have silenced all the insect voices. 
No sound of sylvan life is heard but the harsh 
challenge of a jay, answered from many trees of the 
nearest wood-lot. The far-off hill-tops are molten 
 



 

in the soft azure haze of the season ; the nearer 
slopes and crests sleep under a grayer and thinner 
veil. It is to this scene that the painter turns 
from the easel, with the sullen unconsciousness in 
which he has dwelt upon the picture. Its beauty 
seems at last to penetrate his mood ; he rises and 
looks upon it ; then he goes out on the gallery, and, 
hidden by the fall of one of the curtains, stands 
leaning upon the rail and rapt in the common 
revery of the dreaming world. While he lingers 
there, Cummings appears at the door, and looks 
in ; then with an air of some surprise, as if wonder- 
ing not to see Bartlett, vanishes again, to give 
place to General Wyatt, who after a like research 
retires silently and apparently disconcerted. A 
few moments later Mrs. Wyatt comes to the thresh-
