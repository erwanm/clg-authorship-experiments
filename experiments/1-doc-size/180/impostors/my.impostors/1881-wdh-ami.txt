" Paralysis ? " 

"Yes." 

" I have spent the day in the tall timber, as our 
friends out here say, communing with nature ; and 
I Ye only just come into town since dark, so I hadn 't 
any particulars." He paused, as if expecting that 
Halleck might give them, but upon Jiis remaining 
silent, he resumed. " Of course, as the case now stands, 
I know very well that the law can 't touch me. But 
I didn 't know what the popular feeling might be. 
The Squire laid it on pretty hot, and he might have 
made it livelier for me than he intended: he isn 't 
aware of the inflammable nature of the material out 
here." He gave a nervous chuckle. "I wanted to 
see you, Halleck, to tell you that I haven 't forgotten 
that money I owe you, and that I mean to pay it all 
up, some time, yet. If it hadn 't been for some ex 
penses I Ye had lately, doctor 's bills, and so forth, 
I haven 't been very well, myself," he made a sort 
of involuntary appeal for Halleck 's sympathy, " and 
I Ye had to pay out a good deal of money, I should 
be able to pay most of it now. As it is, I can only 
give you five hundred of it." He tugged his porte- 
monnaie with difficulty up the slope of his panta 
loons. " That will leave me just three hundred to 
begin the world with ; for of course I Ye got to clear 
out of here. And I d got very comfortably settled 
after two years of pretty hard work at the printing 
business, and hard reading at the law. Well, it 's all 
right. And I want to pay you this money, now, and 
I 'll  pay you the rest whenever I can. And I want 
you to tell Marcia that I did it. I always meant to 
do it." 

"Hubbard," interrupted Halleck, "you don 't owe me 
any money. Your father-in-law paid that debt two 
years ago. But you owe some one else a debt that no 
one can pay for you. We needn 't waste words : 



 

what are you going to do to repair the wrong you 
have done the woman and the child " He stopped ; 
the effort had perhaps been too much. 

Bartley saw his emotion, and in his benighted way 
he honored it. " Halleck, you are a good fellow. 
You are such a good fellow that you can 't understand 
this thing. But it 's played out. I felt badly about 
it myself, at one time ; and if I hadn 't been robbed of 
that money you lent me on my way here, I d have 
gone back inside of forty-eight hours. I was sorry 
for Marcia ; it almost broke my heart to think of the 
little one ; but I knew they were in the hands of 
friends ; and the more time I had to think it over, the 
more I was reconciled to what I had done. That was 
the only way out, for either of us. We had tried it 
for three years, and we couldn 't make it go ; we never 
could have made it go ; we were incompatible. Don 't 
you suppose I knew Marcia 's good qualities ? No 
one knows them better, or appreciates them more. 
You might think that I applied for this divorce because 
I had some one else in view. Not any more in mine 
at present ! But I thought we ought to be free, both 
of us ; and if our marriage had become a chain, that 
we ought to break it." Bartley paused, apparently to 
give these facts and reasons time to sink into Halleck 's 
mind. " But there 's one thing I should like to have 
you tell her, Halleck : she was wrong about that girl ; 
I never had anything to do with her. Marcia will 
understand." Halleck made no reply, and Bartley 
resumed, in a burst of generosity, which marked his 
fall into the abyss as nothing else could have done. 
" Look here, Halleck ! I  can 't marry again for two 
years. But as I understand the law, Marcia isn 't 
bound in any way. I know that she always had 
a very high opinion of you, and that she thinks you 
are the best man in the world : why don 't you fix it 
up with Marcia ? " 



Hartley was in effect driven into exile by the ac 
cidents of his suit for divorce which have been de 
scribed. He was not in bodily danger after the first 
excitement passed off, if he was ever in bodily danger 
at all; bnt he could not reasonably hope to estab 
lish himself in a community which had witnessed 
such disagreeable facts concerning him ; before which 
indeed he stood attainted of perjury, and only saved 
from the penalty of his crime by the refusal of his 
wife to press her case. 

As soon as her father was strong enough to be 're 
moved, Marcia returned to the East with him, in the 
care of the friends who continued with them. They 
did not go back to Boston, but went directly to Equity, 
where in the first Hush of the young and jubilant sum 
mer they opened the dim old house at the end of the 
village street, and resumed their broken lives. Her 
father, with one side palsy-stricken, wavered out every 
morning to his office, and sat there all day, the tremu 
lous shadow of his former will. Sometimes his old 
friends came in to see him ; but no one expected now 
to hear the Squire " get going." He no longer got going 
on any topic; he had become as a little child, as 
the little child that played about him there in the 
still, warm summer days and built houses with his law- 
books on the floor. He laughed feebly at her pranks, 
and submitted to her rule with pathetic meekness in 
everything where Marcia had not charged them both 
to the contrary. He was very obedient to Marcia, 
who looked vigilantly after his welfare, and knew all 
his goings and comings, as she knew those of his little 
comrade. Two or three times a day she ran out to see 
that they were safe ; but for the rest she kept herself 
closely housed, and saw no one whom she was not 
forced to see ; only the meat-man and the fish-man 
could speak authoritatively concerning her appear 
ance and behavior before folks. They reported the 



 

latter as dry, cold, and uncommunicative. Doubtless 
the bitter experiences of her life had wrought their 
due effect in that passionate heart; but probably it 
was as much a morbid sensitiveness as a hardened in 
difference that turned her from her kind. The village 
inquisitiveness that invades, also suffers much eccen 
tricity ; and after it had been well ascertained that 
Marcia was as queer as her mother, she was allowed 
to lead her mother 's unmolested life in the old house, 
which had always turned so cold a shoulder to the 
world. Toward the end of the summer the lame 
young man and his sister, who had been several times 
in Equity before, paid her a visit ; but stayed only 
a day or two, as was accurately known by persons 
who had noted the opening and closing of the spare- 
chamber blinds. In the winter he came again, but 
this time he carne alone, and stayed at the hotel. 
He remained over a Sunday, and sat in the pulpit of 
the Orthodox church, where the minister extended to 
him the right hand of fellowship, and invited him 
to make the opening prayer. It was considered a 
good prayer, generally speaking, but it was criticised 
as not containing anything attractive to young peo 
ple. He was understood to be on his way to take 
charge of a backwoods church down in Aroostook 
County, where probably his prayers would be more 
acceptable to the popular taste. 

That winter Squire Gay lord had another stroke of 
paralysis, and late in the following spring he suc 
cumbed to a third. The old minister who had once 
been Mrs. Gaylord 's pastor was now dead : and the 
Squire was buried by the lame man, who came up to 
Equity for that purpose, at the wish, often expressed, 
of the deceased. This at least was the common 're 
port, and it is certain that Halleck officiated. 

In entering the ministry he had returned to the 
faith which had been taught him almost before he 



 

could speak. He did not defend or justify this course 
on the part of a man who had once thrown off all. 
allegiance to creeds ; he said simply that for him there 
was no other course. He freely granted that he 
had not reasoned hack to his old faith ; he had fled 
to it as to a city of refuge. His unbelief had been 
helped, and he no longer suffered himself to doubt ;
