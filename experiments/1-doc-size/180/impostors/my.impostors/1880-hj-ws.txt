" It doesn't seem to me that you are treating me 
just now with all the consideration I deserve," he 
said in a moment. 

" I don't know what I have done," Catherine an- 
swered, with her eyes on her work. 

"You have apparently quite banished from your 
mind the request I made you at Liverpool before we 
sailed the request that you would notify me in ad- 
vance before leaving my house." 

" I have not left your house," said Catherine. 

" But you intend to leave it, and, by what you gave 
me to understand, your departure must be impend- 
ing. In fact, though you are still here in body, you 
are already absent in spirit. Your mind has taken 
up its residence with your prospective husband, and 
you might quite as well be lodged under the conju- 
gal roof for all the benefit we get from your so- 
ciety." 





" I will try and be more cheerful," said Catherine. 

" You certainly ought to be cheerful ; you ask a 
great deal if you are not. To the pleasure of mar- 
rying a charming young man you add that of hav- 
ing your own way; you strike me as a very lucky 
young lady !" 

Catherine got up ; she was suffocating. But she 
folded her work deliberately and correctly, bending 
her burning face upon it. Her father stood where 
he had planted himself ; she hoped he would go, but 
he smoothed and buttoned his gloves, and then he 
rested his hands upon his hips. 

" It would be a convenience to me to know when 
I may expect to have an empty house," he went on. 
" When you go, your aunt marches." 

She looked at him at last, with a long, silent gaze, 
which, in spite of her pride and her resolution, ut- 
tered part of the appeal she had tried not to make. 
Her father's cold gray eye sounded her own, and he 
insisted on his point. 

" Is it to-morrow ? Is it next week, or the week 
after?" 

" I shall not go away !" said Catherine. 

The Doctor raised his eyebrows. " Has he backed 
out?" 

" I have broken off my engagement." 

"Broken it off?" 

" I have asked him to leave New York, and he 
has gone away for a long time." 

The Doctor was both puzzled and disappointed, 
but he solved his perplexity by saying to himself 
that his daughter simply misrepresented justifia- 
bly, if one would, but nevertheless, misrepresented 





the facts ; and he eased off his disappointment, which 
was that of a man losing a chance for a little tri- 
umph that he had rather counted on, by a few words 
that he uttered aloud. 

" How does he take his dismissal ?" 

" I don't know !" said Catherine, less ingeniously 
than she had hitherto spoken. 

" You mean you don't care ? You are rather 
cruel, after encouraging him and playing with him 
for so long !" 

The Doctor had his revenge, after all. 



XXXII. 

OUR story has hitherto moved with very short 
steps, but as it approaches its termination it must 
take a long stride. As time went on, it might have 
appeared to the Doctor that his daughter's account 
of her rupture with Morris Townsend, mere bravado 
as he had deemed it, was in some degree justified by 
the sequel. Morris remained as rigidly and unre- 
mittingly absent as if he had died of a broken heart, 
and Catherine had apparently buried the memory 
of this fruitless episode as deep as if it had ter- 
minated by her own choice. We know that she 
had been deeply and incurably wounded, but the 
Doctor had no means of knowing it. He was cer- 
tainly curious about it, and would have given a good 
deal to discover the exact truth ; but it was his pun- 
ishment that he never knew his punishment, I 
mean, for the abuse of sarcasm in his relations with 
his daughter. There was a good deal of effective 





sarcasm in her keeping him in the dark, and the rest 
of the world conspired with her, in this sense, to be 
sarcastic. Mrs. Penniman told him nothing, partly 
because he never questioned her he made too light 
of Mrs. Penniman for that and partly because she 
flattered herself that a tormenting reserve, and a 
serene profession of ignorance, would avenge her 
for his theory that she had meddled in the matter. 
He went two or three times to see Mrs. Montgom- 
ery, but Mrs. Montgomery had nothing to impart. 
She simply knew that her brother's engagement was 
broken off; and now that Miss Sloper was out of 
danger, she preferred not to bear witness in any 
way against Morris. She had done so before how- 
ever unwillingly because she was sorry for Miss 
Sloper ; but she was not sorry for Miss Sloper now 
not at all sorry. Morris had told her nothing 
about his relations with Miss Sloper at the time, 
and he had told her nothing since. He was always 
away, and he very seldom wrote to her ; she believed 
he had gone to California. Mrs. Almond had, in 
her sister's phrase, " taken up " Catherine violently 
since the recent catastrophe ; but, though the girl 
was very grateful to her for her kindness, she revealed no secrets, and the good lady could give the 
Doctor no satisfaction. Even, however, had she 
been able to narrate to him the private history of 
his daughter's unhappy love affair, it would have 
given her a certain comfort to leave him in ignorance ; for Mrs. Almond was at this time not alto- 
gether in sympathy with her brother. She had 
guessed for herself that Catherine had been cruelly 
jilted she knew nothing from Mrs. Penniman, for 





Mrs. Penniman had not ventured to lay the famous 
explanation of Morris's motives before Mrs. Almond, 
though she had thought it good enough for Catherine and she pronounced her brother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must have 
suffered and must still be suffering. Doctor Sloper 
had his theory, and he rarely altered his theories. 
The marriage would have been an abominable one, 
and the girl had had a blessed escape. She was not 
to be pitied for that, and to pretend to condole with 
her would have been to make concessions to the 
idea that she had ever had a right to think of 
Morris. 

" I put my foot on this idea from the first, and I 
keep it there now," said the Doctor. "I don't see 
anything cruel in that ; one can't keep it there too 
long." To this Mrs. Almond more than once replied that, if Catherine had got rid of her incongruous lover, she deserved the credit of it, and that to bring herself to her father's enlightened view of the 
matter must have cost her an effort that he was 
bound to appreciate. 

" I am by no means sure she has got rid of him," 
the Doctor said. " There is not the smallest proba- 
bility that, after having been as obstinate as a mule 
for two years, she suddenly became amenable to rea- 
son. It is infinitely more probable that he got rid
