beautiful poem to his wife all by heart, and often 
sang " From Greenland's icy mountains." So she 
had a feeling that she did know something about 
India. 

But Mrs. French had really been there, and spent 
two months at Bombay, and almost six months at 
Calcutta. There were so many gorgeous things, 
silks, and bright stuffs with threads of gold, jack- 
ets all embroidery, and queer Eastern dresses, two 
made of pineapple cloth, a sheer, beautiful fabric, 
and one had delicate flowers embroidered in silk. 

But the oddest of all, Hanny thought, was burn- 
ing incense. Mrs. French had several curious 

o 

incense bowls and jars. She lighted one, and in a 
little while the room was filled with an indescrib- 
able fragrance and a hazy purplish air. 

" They burn incense in the Roman Catholic 
churches. Joe took us one Easter Sunday. It 
was very strange, I thought. And a little boy 
swung the- - something - 

" Censer." 

" Oh, yes, censer. And the singing was beautiful. 
But we couldn't understand the prayers ; Joe said 
they were Latin. I suppose he could follow 
them." 

" No doubt ; I have attended some very grand 
services in churches abroad and in England." 

The incense burned out presently, and they went 
downstairs to dinner. Afterward, a niece and 
nephew, her brother's children, came. The girl 
was not quite twelve, but most a head taller than 
Hanny, who felt rather shy with her. The boy 

in 





was older still, and his name was Harold, which 
suggested to Hanny the last of the Saxon kings. 
But he was very dark, and didn't look like a 
Saxon, she thought. 

Mrs. French sent to the livery and ordered a 
carriage, and they all went to drive. Hanny was 
quite conversant with upper New York and West- 
chester County ; but she had only been once to 
Brooklyn. It had quite a country aspect then ; 
but there were beautiful drives, and Greenwood 
Cemetery had already some extremely handsome 
monuments. 

There was something about Eva Bounett that 
suggested Lily Ludlow, and kept Hanny from liking 
her cordially. She laughed at so many things, 
made fun of them ; and Hanny wondered if she 
was criticising her, and would laugh at her when 
she returned home. 

Now and then, Mrs. French would remark, 
" Don't, Eva, that is not a nice thing to say." 
Still she was bright, and at times Hanny had to 
laugh. She found so many Dickens' people along 
the streets ; and really they did look like the pic- 
tures by Cruikshank. And one tall fierce old 
woman, with wisps of hair hanging about her 
neck, and an old torn shawl, who was brandishing 
her arms and talking wildly, she said was Meg 
Merrilies. 

The children remained to tea, and Harold played 
and sang some very pretty songs afterward. 

" But you ought to hear our sister Helen," 
declared Eva. " She sings in church, and sorne- 



times at concerts ; she 's just magnificent. She 's 
nineteen now. And Mary has a good voice; while 
I sing like a crow ! Do you do any of the fine 
things, - - draw or paint? I take music lessons ; but 
I make my teacher's hour vexation of spirit, not 
vanity," and she gave a satisfied kind of laugh. 

" I study music and French. I embroider and 
crochet ' 

" I hate sewing ; I 'd like to be a man and a 
sea-captain. Uncle French is just magnificent; I 
hope he will take me to sea sometime ; I 'm not 
a bit sick; are you? ' 

" I have never been to sea," replied Hanny. 

" Well, just a little ways ; I 've been down to the 
Fishing Banks ; and it 's awful rough. And last 
summer we were at Great South Bay, and went 
out in a yacht; and I learned to row. At all 
events, I mean to marry a sea-captain ; and I 'll just 
go with him every time." 

One of the older brothers dropped in for the 
children. Eva was very effusive in her good-bye, 
and kissed Hanny, and said she must surely come 
to see her. 

Hanny felt quite relieved when she was alone 
again with Mrs. French, who talked of Helen and 
Mary, and seemed to admire them very much. 
" But I don't know what they will do with Eva 
My half-sister, Luella, was just such a noisy harum- 
scarum ; but she had only boys to play with. 
Now, she is getting to be a nice lady-like 
girl." 

Hanny recalled two visits in Hammersley Street, 
8 T T  

when Luella had kept her in a fright all the 
time. 

They went to church Sunday morning, and 
heard Helen Bounett sing. It was very fine and 
moving. Hanny wished Charles could hear her. 

About mid-afternoon, as they were sitting on the 
front piazza, which was shady now, Hanny espied 
her two brothers. Why, Ben was quite as tall as 
Joe ! He looked more like Stephen ; but Joe was 
very good-looking. 

She flew down to meet them, and gave one hand 
to each brother. 

" Oh," she cried joyfully, " I 've had a lovely 
time ! I 've been to India and China ; and I 've had 
incense and ginger preserve, and some beautiful 
silks to take home, and a pineapple handkerchief, 
and a ginger-jar; and I haven't been a bit home- 
sick." 

Mrs. French was watching the eager little face 
that looked so pretty in its enthusiasm of love. 
Doctor Joe stooped and kissed her; Ben waited 
until he was up on the porch. 

They were very cordially welcomed. Mrs. 
French said she was afraid a patient would come 
to hand at an inopportune moment. 

" The city is desperately healthy," returned Joe, 
laughingly. " That 's a young doctor's experience. 
When I am wrinkled and grey-haired, I shall prob- 
ably tell a different story." 

" What do you think I have ? ' turning to Hanny. 
" A letter from Mr. Jasper. A steamer was just 
going out, so he sent a few lines." 



He handed it to her while he resumed his con- 
versation with Mrs. French. 

Hanny devoured it with a thrill. A letter from 
across the ocean ! 

They had a very pleasant journey, with only one
