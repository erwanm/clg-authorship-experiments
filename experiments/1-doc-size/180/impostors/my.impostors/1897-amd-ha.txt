Grandmother Van Kortlandt and Aunt Katrina 
had a fine time visiting Stephen. They were 
quite stylish, old-fashioned style, that wore fine 
English thread-laces with the scent of lavender, 
and had their silvery hair done up in puffs with 
side-combs. They were a little precise and for- 
mal, and would have been horrified if the children 
had not said "Yes, ma'am," and "No, ma'am." 
No free and easy manners for them ! 

The little girl was quite sure she loved Grand- 
mother Underhill the best. Both called her 
Haneran, as if they were a little jealous of a full 
share in her name. Grandmother made quite a 
long visit, for she said, " She might never come 
again, she was getting rather feeble. She didn't 
expect to live to see the little girl married." 

Hanny's father declared, "She couldn't be 
married until she was twenty-five, just in time to 
save her from being an old maid.' 

"But I won't be very old at twenty-five," she 
replied, smiling out of her big innocent eyes. 
"And I thought I wouldn't get married at 
all." 

They did miss Margaret. But the little girl 
had to study hard, and wait on her mother, and 

 

practise her music, and visit. There were so 
many places clamouring for her. 

The boys at Houston Street missed Jim Under - 
hill also, though he often came up that way when 
he could get off, which meant when he did not 
have to stay for a recitation. Though they were 
up to pranks, they were not cruel or malicious. 
If they could "make fun," and rhyme a fellow's 
name ridiculously, and ring door-bells now and 
then, or leave a nicely done-up parcel on some 
one's stoop, wrapped and tied and directed, con- 
taining a box of ashes, or a brick, they were sat- 
isfied. They still considered it fun to have Biddy 
Brady dance, and Limpy Dick, as they called the 
lame girl, run a race. She hopped along with 
her hand on her lame knee with surprising 
rapidity. 


CHAPTER V 

WINTER HAPPENINGS 

MARGARET came home and had a party at her 
house, " Infair " the older people called it. Then 
a family tea at home, and another at Stephen's. 
Mrs. Verplank, the Doctor's half-sister, gave her a 
very elegant reception. 

She was oddly changed, somehow, just as sweet, 
but with more dignity and composure ; and Jim 
couldn't make her turn red by teasing her. The 
little girl noticed that her mother treated Mar- 
garet with a peculiar deference and never scolded 
her; and she said Philip to Dr. Hoffman. 

He had some serious talks with the little girl, 
for he pretended to be afraid she would love 
Dolly and Stephen the best. Everybody had a 
desire to hold her, because she was so little and 
light. She was not to make the baby an excuse 
to go the oftenest to Dolly's. 

" Oh, dear," she rejoined, with a sigh, " and if John 
should get married, and the rest of them, as they 
grow up, I wouldn't have any time left for myself. 
But Joe isn't going to be married." 

Dr. Hoffman laughed at that. 



John had a sweetheart. He always dressed up 
in his best on Wednesday night. Young men in 
those days thought of homes and families of their 
own. There were no clubs to take them in. 

An odd little incident happened to Margaret's 
menage. Stephen had one of Aunt Mary's grand- 
sons as porter in the store. Another, who had 
been brought up as a sort of house-servant to 
some elderly people that death had visited, came 
to the city, and Stephen sent him to Dr. Hoffman, 
who was inquiring about a factotum. He was a 
very well-looking and well-mannered young 
coloured lad, and knew how to drive and care for 
a horse. He was quite a cook also, and soon 
learned to do the marketing. 

Margaret kept house for herself, and enjoyed her 
pretty new china and beautiful cut-glass. And 
after a month or two Dolly persuaded her to rent 
two rooms to two ladies, the back room on the 
second floor, and one on the third. She was glad 
to have some company when the Doctor had to be 
out. One of the ladies coloured plates for maga- 
zines and illustrated books. This was done by 
hand then, and w r as considered quite artistic work. 
We had not printed in colours yet. The ladies 
were very refined, and had a small income beside 
the work. 

The Doctor took Margaret out every pleasant 
afternoon. His practice was not large enough to 
work him very severely. In the evening they read 
or sang, as she played very nicely now. But she 
missed the breezy boys and their doings, and her 

 

mother's cheery voice ordering every one about, 
and, oh, she missed the little girl who didn't come 
half often enough. 

She began a choice piece of work for her, a 
silk quilt. No one had gone insane over crazy 
work then. This was shapely, decorous diamonds, 
with the name of the wearer, or a date, embroid- 
ered on each block. The Morgans had given her 
pieces from Paris and Venice and Holland, and 
even Hong Kong. Some were a hundred and 
more years old, and were gowns of quite famous 
people. 

This fall the American Institute Fair was held 
at Niblo's Garden. There were many curious 
things. Both telegraphs had been put up, 
House's with its letter printing, Morse's with its 
cabalistic signs. How words could travel through 
a bit of wire puzzled most people. Uncle Paid 
went with them one afternoon. 

" No use to tell me," he declared. " The fellow 
at one end knows just what the fellow at the other 
end is going to say. Now if they sent it in a box, 
or a letter, it would look reasonable." 

"I'll send you a message," said Ben; " you 
go down at the end, and see if this doesn't come 
to you." 

He wrote on a slip of paper, and gave it to Uncle 
Paid, who went to the other end with a disbelieving 
shake of the head. And when the receiver wrote 
it out, and Uncle Paid compared it, the astonish- 
ment was indescribable. 

" There 's some jugglery about it," he still in- 

 

sisted. " Stands to reason a bit of wire can't really 
know what you say." 

Hanny brought home her telegraph message ; 
and when she showed it to Nora Whitney, the 
child declared it was like the queer things in some 
books her papa had, called hieroglyphics. But 
Doctor Joe told her a stranger thing than that. He 
found the verses in the Psalms that were supposed 
to prefigure the telegraph : 

" There is no speech nor language, where their voice is 
not heard. 

" Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their
