girls. 


“ I shall count on it all the vacation.” 


Was there not a duty here? Was not hap- 
piness a charm to be diffused about, rather 
than gathered in little circles? She slipped 
Shirley's arm through hers and began leading 
her about, introducing her to several. Miss 
Van Blascom passed. 

“Here is an ardent admirer!” exclaimed 
Helen, “ who deeply and entirely appreciated 
the setting you gave that beautiful song,” and 
she introduced Shirley, who glanced up with 
shy hesitation that made her more charming. 

“ Miss Chardavoyne — let me see — ” and 
the tall girl knit her brow in thought. 
“Wasn’t there — oh! I have it, a poem in 
February’s Miscellany. It was brimming over 
with music. Why, you could write songs. It 
is a fine gift to be able to get the lilt, the swing, 
the tenderness, the melody that can be wedded 
to notes. Some day, I may be singing one of 
your songs.” 

“ Then I must write one just for you,” 
Shirley returned simply with charming candor 

Then Lorraine found them. Her eyes were 
shining with delight. 


 


“ Father is coming for commencement,” 
and there was a joyous ring in her tone. 
“ The letter was in the last mail. I'm just 
wild with delight. I want him to see you. 
Well, little one, have you had a good time? ” 

“ The concert was just lovely, and the girls 
were all so beautiful. I could have looked 
and listened all night.” 

“ There is worship for you and adoration 
in the face!” declared Lorraine. “Did you 
like the violins? I thought them fascinating. 
And here are some of the performers.” 

The girls were in a gay humor. Shirley 
was simply enchanted. 

“ I ought to have tried a little of this be- 
fore,'’ Helen thought, rather conscience- 
smitten. 

There was no ten o’clock to summon them 
in. They were not students now, but simply 
a throng of merry girls who were tempted to 
make a night of it. But there was to-morrow 
to be thought of. 

The juniors were summoned to one of the 
recitation-rooms in the morning. This cere- 
mony was kept a secret from year to year. 



The platform was filled with seniors in trail- 
ing black gowns, and caps, and a great severity 
of manner. An usher seated the new girls, 
who glanced about rather wildly. Were these 
stern professors? 

The tallest one stepped to the front and re- 
quested that through the address there should 
be no shuffling of feet, clapping of hands, 
whistling, cracking of peanuts, whispering, or 
anything that might divert the close attention 
of the speaker from her duties, which con- 
sisted of an address and advice to the young 
and unsophistocated juniors who had suddenly 
been tossed into the wide and dangerous field 
of seniordom, a wilderness of ideas struggling 
toward the light of maturity, with a feeble 
tallow dip in the lantern lighting them over 
bogs and quagmires, with will-o’-wisps of 
every description leading them astray, with 
false prophets crying, “ Lo here ” and “ Lo 
there,” with burial-places by the way haunted 
by ghosts of written quizzes, marked papers, 
exercises returned with politest of messages 
and excellent worldly-wise wisdom, such as 
falls naturally from the lips of experience, and 


 

calculated to make the youthful dismayed and 
their elders serene in their conviction of supe- 
riority. And so she went on with a laughable 
conglomeraton of possibilities and facts, inter- 
spersed with quotations from Plato, from the 
satires of Horace, the comedies of Terence, 
and when there was a giggle the gavel de- 
scended forcibly upon the desk. Another girl 
rambled off in German philosophy, quoting 
Kant and Schopenhauer, and no end of learned 
names; a third took up Italian and Ariosto. 
Then there was a pause. What was coming 
next? There was an attentive hush, but mirth- 
ful eyes twinkled at each other. 

The next was a most cordial welcome to 
the seats of the seniors, the rooms redolent 
with the flavor of teas and spreads, fudge and 
caramels, fun and wisdom, fixed opinions and 
compact prejudices, personally decorative 
labors, undeviating observance of the rules 
and customs of years’ standing. Then the 
speaker's voice dropped to a more serious and 
heartfelt key. There was something nobler, 
sweeter, finer than the mere self-aggrandize- 
ment of study. There were many splendid 


truths in the world, but nothing diffused more 
happiness or raised a higher standard in one’s 
own soul, than love and charity, helpfulness 
to one’s neighbor, the grand golden rule of 
loving as one would be loved, of giving as 
one would be glad to receive. 

Then the seniors stepped down and there 
was a general clasping of hands, the light easy 
chaff, the good wishes, and the tumult of every 
variety of feeling that might have brought the 
tears so near the surface if they had not mar- 
shalled laughter instead. 

Miss Brooks gathered Helen under her 
arm. 

“ I have positively decided to stay,” she be- 
gan, her eyes aglow with a new radiance. “ It 
will be the first year of complete enjoyment, 
and I am afraid something will happen. Is 
it wicked, I wonder, to let one’s self loose with 
a delicious sense of freedom? There was the 
burden of the three years, the shock that shad- 
owed this, but we are to cast our burdens on 
the promise of the great Bearer, and why 
should we not leave them with Him? And 
here is my plan. There is a corner room with 


 

four windows in the Seniors’ Hall, that has 
a magnificent outlook. There is an extra 
charge, for it is admirably fitted up for two, 
a roomy closet for each. I want you. I won- 
der if you feel — ” she hesitated and flushed. 
“ Well, why shouldn’t one be frank and 
honest? The question is whether you can 
afford a little added expense. Perhaps I had 
better save my money, but years of labor 
stretch out before me and I would like to have 
this smiling oasis to look back at when the 
waves of this troublesome world rise high. 
Don’t answer me just now. If you are not in 
a hurry to get away, we will inspect it as soon 
as it is emptied. Miss Cushing is packed up 
and goes just after the seniors’ banquet to 
catch a steamer.”
