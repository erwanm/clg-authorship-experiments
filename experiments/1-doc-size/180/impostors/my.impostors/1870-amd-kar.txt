" Well, what then ? " 

" I cried because Kathie went without me.' 

" But you said you did not want to go, Freddy." 

" I didn't just then, but I did afterwards." 

" Everybody cannot wait for little boys, you know," 
said his uncle. " It was right for Kathie to go if you 
told her that, and losing the ride was sufficient 
punishment." 



 

Eob thought of his discredit and the missed lesson. 
It was an ugly fact against him that would come out 
presently. 

But they had a very pleasant time at the table, and 
then they took a walk through the grounds to see 
what Hugh had been doing. Everything had been 
neglected for so long, that although there was a 
gardener beside Hugh, still the work did not make 
very rapid progress. It would take another season 
to bring the place to perfect order. 

Then Kathie showed him her drawing, which she 
had finished, and the lessons she had learned. 

" I said them all to Hannah, to be sure that I 
knew them. But it wasn't half as nice as having 
you at home. Miss Jessie came over every day, and 
I went out a little." 

" You have done very well indeed. I am pleased 
with your perseverance, for I know it must have 
been rather dull work." 

By this time they had strayed round to Aunt 
Euth's room. " Now I want you to tell me all about 
mamma," she said. " I 'd like to hear what they did 
every day. After you reached New York you took 
a carriage and went to Dr. Markham's, and 
have you seen Mr. Meredith ? ' 





"Yes, lie came that evening. You want it all in 
the fashion of The House that Jack built ? " 

"I am not particular about every repetition/' she 
returned, amused at the idea. 

So Uncle Eobert related the main incidents. One 
had been very pleasant, and that was a call from 
Mrs. Havens. She had met Mrs. Alston several 
times during her early married life, and was very 
well acquainted with her husband's family. 

"And she is so very sweet and friendly. Of 
course mamma liked her. Well, what did they do 
on Friday morning ? ' 

" There was a consultation between Dr. Markham 
and another physician," said Uncle Eobert, slowly. 
" Aunt Euth had recovered from the fatigue of her 
journey, so they decided that it would be well to 
have the operation very soon." 

" Not then ? ' exclaimed Kathie, turning white, 
and grasping Uncle Eobert's hand. 

"My dear child, it was then, and it is all over. 
Aunt Euth is comfortable, though the case was 
worse, or rather more difficult, than they expected. 
Don't look so frightened. They gave her some ether, 
and she went to sleep like a baby. It affected hei 



 

beautifully, they said. Once she roused a little and 
they gave her more, and when she came back to 
consciousness she was bandaged and lying on the 
bed, and had experienced scarcely a pain." 

" O, how good it was that she did not feel it at 
all ! ' : and Kathie drew a long, relieved breath. 
" When does the doctor think she will get well ? " 

"Not in a long while. The most tiresome part 
is yet to come ; but we will all keep of good courage. 
Dr. Markham thinks that she will only be a very 
little lame." 

" Oh," exclaimed Kathie, " won't it be royal to have 
her walking about like other people ? And how did 
mamma feel after it was through ? " 

" Quite rejoiced, you may be sure. We were in 
the next room, waiting very anxiously, and were 
most thankful when the verdict proved so favorable. 
That part is all through, and we need not think of it 
any more. On Monday we shall have a telegram. 
Now, my little girl, don't conjure up any dreadful 
things." 

" Oh, indeed, I shall not, Uncle Eobert. I am so 
very, very thankful and glad that I did not know 
anything about it until it was all through." 





Uncle Eobert amused them in the evening with 
some old Australian stories that the boys were 
always delighted with. It was so nice to have 
him home once more. 

" I wonder how we ever did without you," she 
exclaimed, laughingly, tangling his curly hair with 
her fingers ; " it seems to me that we couldn't live 
at all now." 

" Not with your experience of housekeeping, my 
wise little woman ? ' 

" Oh, I 've done more than that sometimes," said 
Kathie ; " I 've made cake and biscuits, and I used to 
sweep the house for mamma ; but Hannah would not 
let me sweep yesterday for fear that it might make 
my hands hard," - and she laughed gayly. 

" We 'll have biscuits for breakfast on Monday 
morning of your own make, Miss Kathie," Uncle 
Eobert returned ; " and now you must all go to bed, 
for to-morrow will be Sunday, and we must go to 
church and give thanks." 

Kathie kissed him many, many times. 



CHAPTER V. 

GOING TO A PARTY. 

THEIR telegram on Monday contained no bad news. 
Uncle Robert decided that he would not go to the 
city that week unless the accounts were worse. 
Kathie was very glad, but Rob felt that he must 
be a trifle more circumspect. Of course, the dis- 
credit mark came out ; but as Kathie had said 
nothing about his long stay in the woods he con- 
cluded that it would be very childish to go into 
all the details ; he was too large a boy to be called 
to an account for everything. 

" I am sorry that it should happen so soon," said 
his uncle ; " I wanted you to have as clean a record 
as Charlie Barrel!." 

" Oh, I can't be as good as that," declared Rob, 
rather disdainfully. 

" I neveR heard of any boys that were too good/' 
returned his uncle, with a queer little smile. 

The event of the week to Kathie was Lucy Gar- 


diner's birthday party. Mr. Morrison, who was very 
ingenious, had made a pretty black walnut frame for
