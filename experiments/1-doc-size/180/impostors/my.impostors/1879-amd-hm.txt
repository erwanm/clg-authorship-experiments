his particular branch. It paid in the long-run to be honest; and, though
there might be a higher principle than remuneration, that was not a bad
test, after all.

So the third summer opened brilliantly. Yardley, Gilman, and four others
drew up an agreement for a co-operative store. They hired one man who
had been a very successful buyer for a large grocery-firm, which had
failed, and took with it his small invested capital. He was to keep the
books, take orders, and do the buying, subject to the advisement of the
managers. A certain low per cent of profits was agreed upon, just
enough, they calculated, to pay expenses; and the goods were to be
offered as low as possible for cash. The superior quality and reduced
price, they decided, would be more agreeable to most of the men than a
small balance at the end of the year. An account was to be kept with
every member, and the agreement to remain in force one year from date.

And yet there are shoals and quicksands for prosperity, as well as
yawning abysses for adversity. There were people in Yerbury--not bad
souls either--who were not content to allow the world to revolve on any
axis but their own. They could see their neighbors' planets go to
destruction with equanimity--following some law of nature or ethics that
regulated supply and demand of any force, in their estimation; but when
some bright particular star flashed out of the orbit they had set for
it, of course it was beyond the pale of safety. There has always been a
great deal of just such obstinacy in the world, just such narrow
prescribing, and yet--"it does move."

One of the favorite objections of these wiseacres was, that Hope Mills
was founded on a wrong basis. Who knew just exactly what amount of
goods Winston sold? Well, there was the amount manufactured,--the amount
on hand every six months. True,--with a disbelieving shake of the
head,--but he was up in the ways of the world; and what would hinder
him, Ananias-like, from keeping back part of the price? When this was
shown to be an utter impossibility, they still were quite sure Winston
harbored in his secret soul some plan for cheating the workmen at the
last. Here would be all this accumulation of capital, and by some
successful coup-d'Ã©tat Winston and Darcy would swoop down upon it, and
take the lion's share. They were very much afraid that the workmen were
going to be wronged in some underhand way. A defaulting cashier,
unprincipled managers, thieves and forgers, committed their crimes in an
out-and-out way; but there was going to be a profound mystery about
this--the most simple and above-board management, when every man knew,
every six months, the best and the worst of the details.

Employment was becoming more general all through the country. Everybody
drew a long breath, and decided that the grinding times of depression
had passed. We would soon be back to the brilliant era of past
prosperity.

And then there arose a new light in the labor horizon, a prophet who had
discovered the magic key to the workingmen's paradise, and it had only
to be turned by themselves, to gain entrance. Wherever he went, he was
hailed with acclamation.

It was the old, old war upon capital, the old seductive science of
equalizing things, values, money. Every poor man in the country had a
better right to a cottage and garden and a few hours of leisure, than
these few magnates to grasp every thing in their own hands, to roll in
luxury, to feast in magnificence, to clothe their daughters in silks,
velvets, and diamonds--it was to be noted that Mr. McPherson wore an
immense diamond, but it was to be presumed that his wife or daughter did
not. Everywhere one could see the rich growing richer, the poor
poorer, the workman trodden down, brought to the level of slavery with
his long hours and scanty wages. Where was it to end but in a nation of
paupers, of thieves, of criminals of every grade? for, when you made a
brute of a man, there came a time when he turned a brute's hand against
you. This had been the underlying cause of all the world's great
struggles: it had uncrowned kings, it had razed thrones, it had swept
states. There were bits of distorted historical facts, fallacious but
brilliant reasoning, and much bombast.

They heard of him in this city and that, and there was a great deal said
about the cordiality with which he greeted "the horny-handed son of
toil." No town was so small that he disdained it, no city so great that
he feared it. There had been "demonstrations," but he seemed proud of
his defiance of danger.

Men who could not altogether approve of him admitted that he was
"smart," that he uttered a good many truths, half-truths they were,
dressed up in specious falsehoods, all the more dangerous, since the
world does pay homage to virtue and truth. They were troublesome
questions: the great difficulty was the haste made in settling them. A
balance will finally adjust itself, though there may be many vibrations
at first.

It was a fact much to be regretted, that with returning prosperity the
gin-mills and beer-shops of Yerbury had, as a general thing, increased
in their business. A notable instance to the contrary, however, was
Keppler's saloon. It had depended a good deal on the men from Hope Mills
and the iron-works. The latter had been closed so long; and, although
the coffee-house did not seem much of a rival at first, it had gone on
steadily, and given the men time to think. It was not simply the one
glass of beer they took to wash down their midday lunch, but the
treating when a crowd gathered, the many drinks during a heated
discussion of an evening. Not half a dozen of the mill-hands went there
now, so occupied had their minds become with other matters. Keppler's
lease was not out, and his rent was high for the times; he had lost
money and customers, and felt sore over it; he had a grudge against
Jack Darcy as the exponent of a system that interfered with his profits.

McPherson was discussed over pipes and ale one warm June evening, with
brains cleared, of course, by frequent potations and stifling smoke. It
was proposed that he should be invited to lecture at Yerbury.

"I like to see fair play!" cried Keppler. "These fellows over
here"--nodding toward the mill--"have had it all their own way because
they took up a lot of starving men in dull times. That was all well
enough,--praise-worthy--praise-w-o-r-thy," with a long accent. "But
things have changed now,--changed!" with a confident nod. "I'd like to
hear what the man has to say. You see, he has come up from the ranks, he
has been poor himself!"

So the ball was put in motion. McPherson's speech at Millville, a great
laboring-centre, was read aloud with frequent cheering. And the
laboring-men at Yerbury began to wonder why wages were not higher, when
so many shops were running on full time! Somebody was making a great
deal of money: they could barely live. Bread and meat had not fallen
in the ratio of wages. It was still next door to starvation.

Finally some self-constituted labor-committee sent the letter of
invitation, and received a cordial and flattering reply. Mr. McPherson
had heard of Yerbury. He would be only too glad to come among them in
his humble capacity, and shed what light he could upon the side of right
and truth; raise his voice for the oppressed against the oppressor. And
he mentioned that open-air meetings were generally more successful.

They put up a platform on the Common, the largest park in Yerbury. The
day was very fine, not too hot, and a shower the evening before had laid
the dust. At precisely four, a deputation awaited Mr. McPherson and his
party at the station, escorted them to the Bedell House to refresh, and
then to the grand hall of nature, with its waving arches of glistening
green overhead.

Already a great concourse had assembled. Mr. McPherson mounted his
rostrum, and, after a few preliminary flourishes, began in a clear,
strong tone, that had the power of concentrating the attention of his
audience. He went back centuries, and proved that from the very
beginning of all industries there had been the desire to oppress, that
the working-classes had to combine and fight for every advantage gained,
to wrest from kings, peers, masters, even equals, the privileges they
held to-day. Plainly, capital was a tyrant fattening on unpaid toil.
"Were not the rich always in the ranks of capital, always against the
poor man? They squeezed him to the utmost when they had need, then they
flung him away. Did it matter to them if his wife and children starved?
If he stole a loaf of bread to appease the pangs of hunger, he was sent
to prison; but if a bank president stole half a million, he went
to--Europe! [Laughter and applause.] Does the capitalist employ the
laborer in order that there shall be fewer starving men in the country?
It comes in the market, and buys at the lowest price, solely for its own
benefit. It does not concern capital, whether this man can support wife
and children on such a pittance: what business has he with wife and
children! If the man drops at the work-bench, the victim of long hours,
exhaustive toil, insufficient food, the town will thrust him into a
pauper's grave, and another will fill his place. Even negro-slavery was
more noble than this: it was to the master's interest that the slave
should be well fed. Capital was shrewd, selfish, experienced, astute,
strong: labor was kept in ignorance lest it might learn its worth, its
rights; it was half-starved that it might be weak; it was driven from
pillar to post with a more cruel than slave-driver's whip, that it might
never be able to perfect a successful organization."

And so on and on. The crowd increased. The six-o'clock bells rang, and
the procession from shops wended their way thither, many from curiosity,
some from a hope of a new truth, and not a few filled with a secret
sense of wrong and dissatisfaction. Mr. McPherson was still belaboring
capital. Now he had declared it "a stupendous fraud, a hollow bubble, a
reputation for wealth where no wealth existed, a fictitious claim for
what was not, but which still managed to hold the workman in its iron
grasp; the concentrated labor of the men, not the lawful working
interest of money. Some way this system of evil was going to be uprooted
by men standing firm, refusing the wages of sweat and blood; and in the
general overturn by legislation of state and country, every man was to
have a farm or a factory, to quit work in the middle of the afternoon,
and sit with folded hands on his own door-step, his own master, a free
man!" [Great shouting and applause.]

He talked until seven, and wound up at last with a desperate but covert
onslaught on Hope Mills. "No two men or six men, or company of any kind,
had a right to band together to starve not only the men in their own
town, but the laborers throughout the world, by so reducing wages for
