was bitter; if you knew nothing about the man or his cause, 
you would find this repellent and shocking. You had to know 
what his life had been an unceasing conflict with oppression; 
he had got his Socialist education in jail, where he had been 
sent for trying to organise the wage-slaves of a gigantic corpora- 
tion. His rage was the rage of a tender-hearted poet, a lover 




of children and of Nature, driven mad by the sight of torment 
wantonly inflicted. And if ever he had seemed to you an ex- 
tremist, too angry to be excused, here to-night he had his 
vindication, here to-night you saw him as a prophet. For 
now the master-class had torn the mask from its face, and 
revealed to the whole world what were its moral standards ! At 
last men saw their rulers face to face ! 

They had plunged mankind into a pit of lunacy. "They 
call it war" cried the speaker; "but I call it murder." And 
he went on to picture to them what was happening in Europe 
at that hour he brought the awful nightmare before their eyes, 
he showed them homes blown to pieces, cities given to the flames, 
the bodies of men pierced by bullets or torn to fragments by 
shells. He pictured a bayonet plunged into the abdomen of a 
man ; he made you see the ghastly deed, and feel its shuddering 
wickedness. Men and women and children sat spell-bound; and 
for once no man could say aloud or feel in his heart that the 
pictures of a Socialist agitator were overdrawn no, not even 
Ashton Chalmers, president of the First National Bank of Lees- 
ville, or old Abel Granitch, proprietor of the Empire Machine 
Shops! 



And what was the cause of this blackest of calamities ? The 
speaker went on to show that the determining motive was not 
racial jealousy, but commercial greed. The fountain-head of 
the war was world-capitalism, clamouring for markets, seeking 
to get rid of its surplus products, to keep busy its hordes of 
wage-slaves at home. He analysed the various factors; and 
now, with the shadow of the European storm over their heads 
now at last men and women would listen, they would realise that 
the matter concerned them. He warned them let them not 
think that they were safe from the hoofs of this war-monster, 
just because they were three thousand miles away ! Capitalism 
was a world phenomenon, and all the forces of parasitism and 
exploitation which had swept Europe into this tragedy were 
active here in America. The money-masters, the profit-seekers, 
would leap to take advantage of the collapse over the seas ; there 
would be jealousies, disputes let the audience understand, once 
for all, that if world-capitalism did not make this a world-war, 





it would be only because the workers of America took warning, 
and made their preparations to frustrate the conspiracy. 

This was what he had come for, this was the heart of his 
message. Many of those who listened were refugees from the 
old world, having fled its oppressions and enslavements. He 
pleaded with them now, as a man whose heart was torn by more 
suffering than he could bear let there be one part of the fair 
garden of earth into which the demons of destruction might not 
break their way ! Let them take warning in time, let them or- 
ganise and establish their own machinery of information and 
propaganda so that when the crisis came, when the money- 
masters of America sounded the war-drums, there might be 
not the destruction and desolation which these masters willed, 
but the joy and freedom of the Co-operative Commonwealth ! 

"How many years we Socialists have warned you !" he cried. 
"But you have doubted us, you have believed what your ex- 
ploiters have told you! And now, in this hour of crisis, you 
look at Europe and discover who are the real friends of human- 
ity, of civilisation. What voice comes over the seas, protest- 
ing against war? The Socialist voice, and the Socialist voice 
alone ! And to-night, once more, you hear it in this hall ! You 
men and women of America, and you exiles from all corners 
of the world make this pledge with me make it now, before 
it is too late, and stand by it when the hour of crisis comes! 
Swear it by the blood of our martyred heroes, those slaughtered 
German Socialists swear that come what will, and when and 
how it will, that no power on earth or in hell beneath the earth 
shall draw you into this fratricidal war ! Make this resolution, 
send this message to all the nations of the earth that the men 
of all nations and all races are your brothers, and that never 
will you consent to shed their blood. If the money-masters and 
the exploiters want war, let them have it, but let it be among 
themselves! Let them take the bombs and shells they have 
made and go out against one another ! Let them blow their own 
class to pieces but let them not seek to lure the working-people 
into their quarrels " 

Again and again, in answer to such exhortations, the audi- 
ence broke out into shouts of applause. Men raised their hands 
in solemn pledge; and the Socialists among them went home 
from the meeting with a new gravity in their faces, a new con- 
secration in their hearts. They had made a vow, and they 



 

would keep it yes, even though it meant sharing the fate of 
their heroic German comrades ! 

And then in the morning they opened their papers, looking 
eagerly for more details about the fate of the heroic German 
comrades, and they found none. Day after day, morning and 
afternoon, they looked for more details, and found none. On 
the contrary, to their unutterable bewilderment, they learned 
that the leaders of the German Social-democracy had voted for 
the war-budgets, and that the rank and file of the movement 
were hammering out the goose-step on the roads of Belgium and 
France! They could not bring themselves to believe it; even 
yet they have not brought themselves to realise that the story 
which thrilled them so on that fatal Sunday afternoon was 
only a cunning lie sent out by the German war-lords, in the 
hope of causing the Socialists of Belgium and France and Eng- 
land to revolt, and so give the victory to Germany ! 




THE grey flood of frightfulness rolled over Belgium; and 
 every morning, and again in the afternoon, the front page 
of the Leesville newspaper was like the explosion of a bomb. 
Twenty-five thousand Germans killed in one assault on Liege; 
a quarter of a million Russians massacred or drowned in the 
swamps of the Masurian lakes; so it went, until the minds of 
men reeled. They saw empires and civilisations crumbling be- 
fore their eyes, all those certainties upon which their lives had 
been built vanishing as a mist at sunrise. 

Hitherto, Jimmie Higgins had always refused to take a 
daily paper. No capitalist lies for him; he would save his 
pennies for the Socialist weeklies! But now he had to have 
the news, and tired as he was after the day's work, he would 
sit on his front porch with his ragged feet against a post, spell- 
ing out the despatches. Then he would stroll down to the 
cigar-stand of Comrade Stankewitz, a wizened-up little Rou- 
manian Jew who had lived in Europe and had a map, and 
would show Jimmie which was Russia, and why Germany 
marched across Belgium, and why England had to interfere. It 
was good to have a friend who was a man of travel and a 
linguist especially when the fighting became centred about 
places such as Przemysl and Przasnyaz! 

Then every Friday night would be the meeting of the local. 
Jimmie would be the first to arrive, eager to hear every word 
the better informed comrades had to say, and thus to complete 
the education which society had so cruelly neglected. 

Before the war was many weeks old, Jimmie's head was in 
a state of utter bewilderment; never would he have thought it 
possible for men to hold so many conflicting opinions, and to 


 

hold them with such passionate intensity ! It seemed as if the 
world-conflict were being fought out in miniature in Leesville. 

At the third meeting after the war began, the prosperous Dr. 
Service arose, and in his impressive oratorical voice moved that 
the local should send a telegram to the National Executive Com- 
mittee of the party, requesting it to protest against the invasion 
of Belgium; also a telegram to the President of the United 
States, requesting him to take the same action. And then 
what pandemonium broke loose! Comrade Schneider, the 
brewery-worker, demanded to know whether Local Leesville had 
ever requested the National Executive Committee to protest 
against the invasion of Ireland. Had the Socialist party ever 
requested the President of the United States to protect Egypt 
and India from oppression? 

Comrade Dr. Service, who had remained on his feet, began
