Sire. And I want to bring to it the people I 
love, and the people who need love and pleasure 
and happiness. I want to make it a little oasis in 
the lives of some tired souls, so they can go on 
their way refreshed, and as I do not need a col- 
lege degree for this, I am anxious to begin. We 
will have our summer together and I shall want 
to keep watch of every step of your way and be 
proud of your successes. You make an abso- 
lute joy of study. Mrs. Aldred said in the winter 
when we had so many talks, that a school of 
girls like you, who were as honest, as ambitious 
and thorough, would be the most delightful work 
in life that she could think of." 

"Did she say that?" Helen's face glowed with 
pleasure. "Then I must be careful and live up 
to my reputation." 

"And now is it all explained? You see there 
were matters of which I could not tell the end 
from the beginning. And they might not have 
ended this way. But it was from no lack of 
love—" 

"And I really Tacked the trust. I am ashamed 
of the doubts that crept in. And in a way I 
certainly was jealous, and I just hate jealousy, 
too, it is such a mean, grudging vice. I think 



 

you have the most to forgive, I am sorry not to 
have you for my college chum — " 

"And keep prodding me up continually, lest I 
should fall behind," laughed Juliet interrupting 
her friend. 

"I can see that your choice is better for your- 
self and I will not be so narrow and self-con- 
ceited as not to admit it. But I shall miss you. 
I am finding out every moment how much you 
have been to me this last year." 

"I am glad if I have made any return for what 
you were to me at first. Oh, you with your hope- 
ful nature can hardly realize the dreariness and 
the longings of those first few months, unless 
it was that time you thought you would have to 
go away from all your friends to England." 

The tears glistened in Helen's eyes, remember- 
ing that time little more than a year ago. Out 
of that dismal time had blossomed this rich and 
happy year. Had she not something beside the 
cup of cold water to give? 

Yet after the lights were out and all was still, 
Helen thought of the change and wondered if she 
would make new friends as easily as she had 
heretofore. The four years of study did not 
look so glowing and enticing as they had. She 
wondered if she would consider it a necessity if 





she had Juliet's fortune. How little her friend 
had ever plumed herself upon itl 

"I do not believe I could have been so modest 
and unconcerned. Most girls were proud enough 
of rich fathers, even when there were more chil- 
dren to provide for, and hers was all her own." 

A day or two after in a leisure hour they looked 
over Mrs. Gartney's poems. They were of the 
intense school with perfect rhythm and most 
musical ; choice in their selection of words and es- 
caping the tendency to hopelessness that seemed 
to shadow so many of the younger poets. Through 
the most sombre rift came a gleam of light cheer- 
ing in its very unexpectedness. 

In the second volume were some Christmas 
poems of the Virgin and her babe that breathed 
the most exquisite mother love and watchful 
solicitude, and prefiguring the sorrow of the days 
to come. There was "Good night to a Child" 
that touched one with its tender pathos, and other 
little gems that went to one's heart. 

Helen had been reading them aloud. Some- 
times there were little breaks and halts in her 
voice for they did appeal strongly to her emo- 
tional nature. 

There was a silence of some moments, then 
Helen exclaimed indignantly — 



 

"She could have so much imaginary tenderness 
for dream children, and none for these to whom 
she was to fulfill the duties of real motherhood !" 

"Perhaps she did fulfill the outward duties." 

"But the inward grace surely was lacking. 
And it looks like a direct punishment. She 
crowded them out of their father's love and now 
God has taken him from her. I dare say she will 
write some most pathetic poems of sorrow and 
loss, and the world will say — 'How she loved 
him.' " 

"Which will be the truth. I suppose there are 
exclusive natures that can love only one person." 

"One person at a time," subjoined Helen with 
a touch of scorn. "And if we should keep up 
our knowledge of her we shall hear in the course 
of a few years that she is married again." 

Juliet felt it was not wise to gainsay this. 

After a week the children were returned to 
school robed in deepest mourning, and with a 
trunk full of new garments. Mrs. Gartney's 
letter was almost tragic. She thought it strange 
the children did not feel their loss more, she was 
simply overwhelmed, and she had only had Mr. 
Gartney barely three years. But she possessed 
a nature that suffered intensely, and her love had 
a depth that few could ever know. She had or- 





dered the children's wardrobe, the other gar- 
ments could be given to the poor. Mr. Gartney's 
business was in a sad state of confusion and he 
had died too young to amass much of a fortune. 
Whether there would be anything beside their 
mother's estate for them she could not tell at 
present. She would have no charge of the busi- 
ness. 

"She had better not have bought such expen- 
sive outfits for the children," Grace Aldred said 
to her mother. "It seems cruel to load them with 
it. Summer is coming and by next fall the frocks 
will be outgrown. I cannot bear to see children 
shrouded in such deep mourning." 

"They will wear white most of the time. Yes, 
it is really a waste," was the sensible reply. 

Wilma expressed her opinions with girlish 
vehemence. 

"I hate black frocks ! What makes you have 
to wear them? All my sorrow and pain is in- 
 side, in my heart, and just makes it harder to 

look at the black things. I told mamma I didn't 
want them and she said I was a heartless little 
girl. I'm so glad we shall not have to live with 
her, and I am sure papa must be happier in
