Mr. Seton gave a chuckle. "Well, it's for our- 
selves, you see, or rather for Widow Kean. Pity 
if we couldn't take trouble for some one we've 
known from a little gal. And Joe Kean was a 
first-rate fellow. 'Twas an awful shame he should 
die so young. And the goodness seems mostly on 
your part. My I how everybody will enjoy it, be- 
side the money. You see folks about here, the 
real old settlers I mean, don't often get to the 
big towns and see plays. You won't mind if we 
have a crowd?" 

"Oh, no. It would be rather mortifying to play 
to empty seats," returned Miss Travis. 

Mr. Seton laughed and gave a confident nod, 
wrinkling up his nose and half shutting his eyes. 
They had a little walk along the shore afterward. 
The air was crystal clear this morning and the 
sands seemed alight with gold. 

"Now you young men must look up your own 



I 

amusement I must have Miss Grant the rest 
of the morning, and Annie, there are several 
things mother wishes you to do, so you had bet- 
ter come with us," said Miss Travis. 

Annie turned reluctantly. She was to have a 
minor part in the play but knew her lines. 

There were two girl guests beside, who were 
much interested. It was a bright little society 
play with a misunderstanding between the lovers, 
and the friend's efforts to explain led to some 
rather laughable complications. Helen had the 
part of the friend. 

"It is rather hard to ask you to do so much," 
said Miss Travis. "But you have such a quick 
memory." 

"Oh, I am truly glad to help you in any way," 
Helen returned in her heartsome manner. 

They read it over and Miss Travis made sev- 
eral explanations. Then luncheon was an- 
nounced. The guests and the children were all at 
the table and Helen enjoyed it extremely. But she 
insisted afterward that she must return home and 
devote herself to business. 

"We will come down in the evening to see how 
you get along and to hear your friend, Miss Cra- 
ven, play. IVe been telling Mr. Danforth about 
her." 





Mrs. Gilbert brought some embroidery down 
to the cottage to spend the afternoon. The ladies 
sat on the porch enjoying the sea breezes and hav- 
ing a pleasant chat while Helen applied herself 
to her task. With her vivid insight she caught 
the spirit of the play and was full of interest. 

She almost hoped the young men would find 
some other diversion for the evening, but they 
did not. Mr. Danforth was very much delighted 
in Miss Craven's music, but if he had not been 
he would hardly have found a chance with Helen, 
for young Travis seemed to think he had a right 
to monopolize her as they were to be in the 
play together. 

There was much going back and forth and 
some pleasure trips so that they should not take 
the matter too seriously. Mr. Wilmarth joined 
his household and was at once interested in the 
young people. The prospect of the play seemed 
to stir up a great excitement. When Mr. Osborne 
came down they began with rehearsals, and for 
a wonder everything went smoothly. Helen 
liked him very much. There was another influx 
of guests, indeed the Travis house seemed quite 
like a hotel, and the spirit of welcome was de- 
lightful. 

At length the eventful evening arrived. They 




had inspected their improvised theatre and found 
everything in admirable order. Scenery and para- 
phernalia had been taken over. A small room had 
been cleared of various matters to be used as a 
kind of ante-room, and dressing-room for the 
girls. 

James went out to reconnoitre as the band be- 
gan tuning up, and came back large-eyed. 

"Why, the place is packed already," he cried. 
"They haven't even left an aisle. Come, you 
must be on the mark." 

Mr. Osborne looked at his watch and laughed. 
"We are not due until eight. Now above all 
things, don't a soul of you get a stage fright 
when you face this immense audience, though I 
have a feeling they will not be over critical." 

The band played an overture. The curtain 
went up without a hitch. The place was packed, 
and all around the wall men were standing who 
could find no seats. The first act was a de- 
cided success and the applause was generous. 
The players were in fine spirits. Helen enjoyed 
her part immensely, and it seemed to her as 
if the play was very much shorter in the acting. 

"There wasn't a break anywhere," said Mr. 
Osborne delightedly. "Miss Travis and I were 
old hands at it, but the rest of you deserve a 




great deal of credit. And they ought to have 
made considerable money." 

Mr. Seton came up before they had all their 
goods put in proper order. 

"Well, we had them from everywhere," he 
said with a triumphant ring in his voice. "Tell 
you what, all them there carriages and wagons 
looked like a Fourth of July procession, and the 
store is full of men now talking it over. 'Twas 
first rate ! And now you folks must come down 
in the dining room where Mrs. Seton has a little 
spread for you." 

"I hope you have realized your expectations." 

"We've had some promises and some donations 
and a crowded house and there will be three hun- 
dred dollars to pay on the mortgage. We never 
can thank you young people enough, for, besides 
the money, it was just splendid! I don't know 
when I've had such a good time, and every one 
feels just about the same." 

The Travis carriage took the younger members 
of the family and the Wilmarths. Juliet and Mrs. 
Gilbert went in another. The "company" pleased 
Mrs. Seton by accepting her little supper, for 
truth to tell their work had given them a good 
appetite. 

"Your people are always so good. Miss Tra- 



 

VIS," Mrs. Seton declared. "It's a great pleasure 
to have you come down in the summer. Of 
course we know you are some of the city style 
and we are plain country folks, but we are not 
quite boors and occasionally do resent the airs 
some of the new-comers put on. .We're not look- 
ing to company with them nor to be invited to
