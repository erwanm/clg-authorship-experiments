" Yes. The reasons for spending money are, to 
do good or to get good. I think the present case 
falls under the first head." 

" It would give a great deal of pleasure " I said 
doubtfully. 

" That is one of the ways of doing good," said 
Mr. Iredell smiling. "Don't you see, it will be useful that your friends at Chesterfield should know 
you have not forgotten them ? and they must have 
tangible proof of it. It is right to comfort them up 
a bit, too, for the loss of you; and I think all the influence of your past life among them will be height 
ened and established by this remembrance of them 
now. So go on, and let us have the names. It is 
no virtue in me to give money, Desire ; all my life it 
has been, that where I laid down one dollar for the 
Lord's service, he gave me two. Ask yourself only 




the question, what in each case would give the 
most lasting benefit and pleasure. Now let us 
see." 

What an evening's work that was ! what a time 
of delight unmixed and unalloyed! I knew, taking 
the names one by one, I knew what would just 
meet a long -felt want here, or supply an un 
dreamed-of delectation there. Mr. Iredell took 
every scruple from me at last, and we made up 
our list royally. Mrs. Macartney's black silk led 
off; and there was a large Bagster's Bible, with ref 
erences, for Deacon Parsons; and Hugh Miller's 
writings for Mr. Chandler; and Taylor Lewis's 
works for Mr. Binnacle; while to their wives went 
dress patterns and caps and shawls. .Here a work- 
box, fitted up ; there a writing-desk ditto. To all 
the Teachers meeting people, Bagster's Bibles of 
the octavo edition. . An edition I knew only by 
Mr. Iredell's own, which I had seen long ago in 
the library in Poulteney Place once or twice; indeed it w r as there also, in Olive's room, that I had 
seen and studied the larger edition, which I des 
tined for Deacon Parsons. Then there were poorer 
houses, where the gifts were a little different. A 
carpet in one; a tea-service in another; and for one 
poor man who had lost his horse, and could not, I 
knew, afford to replace the loss, I laughingly confessed that I wanted some old Dobbin or other. Mr. 
Iredell's lips took a certain set at that, and the entry went down in his note-book, I thought, with 
significant energy. Ah what an evening we had! 



 

For indeed it took the evening; there was so much 
to discuss. 

" When are we going to do all this ? " I asked 
with a sudden wondering scruple, after we had got 
through. 

"To-morrow." - 

" Can we do it in one day ? " 

"I think so. If you know what you want, and 
know where to get it, there is no need to be long 
about such business unless you are an undecided 
character. What do you think you want for your 
self, Desire ? " 

"For myself?" I looked down at my white 
dress, almost the only thing I had which could 
pass muster anywhere but at Chesterfield; and yet 
the sense of want could not get any prominence 
in my mind. " I suppose I ought to have a few things," I went on. "My old straw bonnet is hardly fit to go about with you." 

"You will learn some day that the wearer makes 
the bonnet," Mr. Iredell said with a contented ex 
pression. 

That satisfied me. If he did not care, I did not 
care certainly; and I remembered Olive's words 
once spoken, that Mr. Iredell did not notice how 
people dressed. I had not believed them at the 
time; and I found now, the next day, that I had 
boeri quite right in not believing them. I found an 
other thing; that I was myself the centre of the day's 
business. The Chesterfield things were attended 
to, well and duly, no doubt; yet that was done as



 

it were by the way ; and Mr. Iredell's special pleasure and care were expended in supplying me with 
every imaginable thing which I could be even supposed to want. He knew, doubtless, that my little 
old trunk did not hold much. That trunk was 
destined now to go back to Chesterfield with stores 
for Arethusa and Mrs. Quick; and not one but two 
magnificent leather packing cases were provided 
for the accommodation of my belongings. We did 
an enormous amount of business that day. I 
found we were served with a quick readiness and 
submissiveness which ensured us against unnecessary loss of time; Mr. Iredell had a quiet way 
of doubling my orders, which was impressive; and 
at any rate, without that, it was enough for him to 
shew himself anywhere to gain immediate and obsequious attention. My old bonnet, in such com 
pany, fared as well as if it had been a coronet. But 
Mr. Iredell's attention came round to that too, in 
due course, and he took me where it was to be exchanged for another; or rather, for others. And I 
found he was not easily suited. I would have 
made a short business of it, to spare his time; 
but that would not do. I was getting nothing 
splendid or showy; it made no difference; I was 
made to try on one bonnet after another, till those 
were found which perfectly suited his taste and 
which perfectly fitted me. I learned a lesson, 
quietly, in that milliner's shop. Indeed I never 
thought otherwise, but that a person so fond of all 
the refinements of beauty and propriety would care 



 

for them also in his wife and in all that concerned 
her. 

Do what we could, however, we were not able to 
accomplish all our business in one day. We must 
take part of another; and so came a queer rencounter. 

The evening of this day was spent in writing 
notes to go to Chesterfield, whither the various 
packages had been despatched by express. Happy writing ! I ought to have been very tired ; but 
pleasure I think prevents that sometimes. I wrote 
notes busily, and Mr IredelL directed them; distracting me a little, I confess, by talking the while. 
In the midst of this, came one of the waiters of the 
hotel with a card on a salver which he brought to 
me. I read, bewildered, the name of "Mrs. St. 
Ives " and handed the card to Mr. Iredell. He 
studied it a minute. . 

" Is the lady here ? " he asked. 

" Yes, sir. In the parlour, sir." 

" Will you see her, Desire ? It is a very unwar 
rantable intrusion!" Mr. Iredell said in a low voice. 
" Will you receive her?" 

"If you please," I said. "Yes. I do not care. 
It is only her way." 

" I will go to her," said Mr. Iredell. " Perhaps 
there is some mistake. Sit still; I will bring her 
to you, if necessary." 

I guessed there was no mistake. Ernestine was 
following her old rule, of doing what she had a 
mind to do, irrespective of the rights of the case or 
the rights of other people. I was more amused than 



 

anything else. Presently I heard voices, the door 
opened, and in she came, Mr. Iredell following her. 

It is impossible to describe, the air of mingled 
LiTuce, graciousness, and spitefulness, with which 
she came towards me. On her good behaviour, as 
she was, and afraid of betraying herself, yes, and 
wishing to practise ingratiation ; but clever as she 
is, she could not manage everything at once. Her 
black eyes snapped, while her mouth smiled.
