“Oh yes.”

“How is all Boston?” asked Dan boldly.

“I don’t know; I’m just going down to Old Point Comfort to ask. Every
other house on the Back Bay has been abandoned for the Hygeia.” Mrs.
Brinkley stopped, and then she asked. “Are you just up from there?”

“No; but I don’t know but I shall go.”

“Hello, Mavering!” said Mr. Brinkley, coming up and taking his hand into
his fat grasp. “On your way to Fortress Monroe? Better come with us.
Why; Munt!”

He turned to greet this other Bostonian, who had hardly expressed his
joy at meeting with his fellow-townsmen when the hostess rustled softly
up, and said, with the irony more or less friendly, which everybody uses
in speaking of Boston, or recognising the intellectual pre-eminence of
its people, “I’m not going to let you keep this feast of reason all
to your selves. I want you to leaven the whole lump,” and she began to
disperse them, and to introduce them about right and left.

Dan tried to find his Virginian again, but she was gone. He found Miss
Anderson; she was with her aunt. “Shall we be tearing you away?” she
asked.

“Oh no. I’m quite ready to go.”

His nerves were in a tremble. Those Boston faces and voices had brought
it all back again; it seemed as if he had met Alice. He was silent and
incoherent as they drove home, but Miss Anderson apparently did not want
to talk much, and apparently did not notice his reticence.

He fell asleep with the pang in his heart which had been there so often.

When Dan came down to breakfast he found the Brinkleys at a pleasant
place by one of the windows, and after they had exchanged a pleased
surprise with him that they should all happen to be in the same hotel,
they asked him to sit at their table.

There was a bright sun shining, and the ache was gone out of Dan’s
heart. He began to chatter gaily with Mrs. Brinkley about Washington.

“Oh, better come on to Fortress Monroe,” said her husband. “Better come
on with us.”

“No, I can’t just yet,” said Dan. “I’ve got some business here that will
keep me for awhile. Perhaps I may run down there a little later.”

“Miss Anderson seems to have a good deal of business in Washington too,”
 observed Brinkley, with some hazy notion of saying a pleasant rallying
thing to the young man. He wondered at the glare his wife gave him. With
those panned oysters before him he had forgotten all about Dan’s love
affair with Miss Pasmer.

Mrs. Brinkley hastened to make the mention of Miss Anderson as
impersonal as possible.

“It was so nice to meet her again. She is such an honest, wholesome
creature, and so bright and full of sense. She always made me think of
the broad daylight. I always liked that girl.”

“Yes; isn’t she jolly?” said Dan joyously. “She seems to know everybody
here. It’s a great piece of luck for me. They’re going to take a house
in Washington next winter.”

“Yes; I know that stage,” said Mrs. Brinkley. “Her aunt’s an amusingly
New-York respectability. I don’t think you’d find just such Miss Mitford
curls as hers in all Boston.”

“Yes, they are like the portraits, aren’t they?” said Dan; delighted.
“She’s very nice, don’t you think?”

“Very. But Miss Anderson is more than that. I was disposed to be
critical of her at Campobello for a while, but she wore extremely well.
All at once you found yourself admiring her uncommon common-sense.

“Yes. That’s just it,” cried Dan. “She is so sensible!”

“I think she’s very pretty,” said Mrs. Brinkley.

“Well, her nose,” suggested Dan. “It seems a little capricious.”

“It’s a trifle bizarre, I suppose. But what beautiful eyes! And her
figure! I declare that girl’s carriage is something superb.”

“Yes, she has a magnificent walk.”

“Walks with her carriage,” mused Brinkley aloud.

His wife did not regard him. “I don’t know what Miss Anderson’s
principles are, but her practices are perfect. I never knew her do an
unkind or shabby thing. She seems very good and very wise. And that
deep voice of hers has such a charm. It’s so restful. You feel as if
you could repose upon it for a thousand years. Well! You will get down
before we leave?”

“Yes, I will,” said Dan. “I’m here after a man who’s after a patent,
and as soon as I can finish up my business with him I believe I will run
down to Fortress Monroe.”

“This eleven-o’clock train will get you there at six,” said Brinkley.
“Better telegraph for your rooms.”

“Or, let us know,” said Mrs. Brinkley, “and we’ll secure them for you.”

“Oh, thank you,” said Dan.

He went away, feeling that Mrs. Brinkley was the pleasantest woman he
ever met. He knew that she had talked Miss Anderson so fully in order
to take away the implication of her husband’s joke, and he admired her
tact. He thought of this as he loitered along the street from Wormley’s
to the Arlington, where he was going to find Miss Anderson, by an
appointment of the night before, and take a walk with her; and thinking
of tact made him think of Mrs. Pasmer. Mrs. Pasmer was full of tact; and
how kind she had always been to him! She had really been like a mother
to him; he was sure she had understood him; he believed she had defended
him; with a futility of which he felt the pathos, he made her defend him
now to Alice. Alice was very hard and cold, as when he saw her last; her
mother’s words fell upon her as upon a stone; even Mrs. Pasmer’s tears,
which Dan made her shed, had no effect upon the haughty girl. Not that
he cared now.

The blizzard of the previous days had whirled away; the sunshine lay
still, with a warm glisten and sparkle, on the asphalt which seemed to
bask in it, and which it softened to the foot. He loitered by the gate
of the little park or plantation where the statue of General Jackson
is riding a cock-horse to Banbury Cross, and looked over at the
French-Italian classicism of the White House architecture with a pensive
joy at finding pleasure in it, and then he went on to the Arlington.

Miss Anderson was waiting for him in the parlour, and they went a long
walk up the avenues and across half the alphabet in the streets, and
through the pretty squares and circles, where the statues were sometimes
beautiful and always picturesque; and the sparrows made a vernal
chirping in the naked trees and on the green grass. In two or three they
sat down on the iron benches and rested.

They talked and talked--about the people they knew, and of whom they
found that they thought surprisingly alike, and about themselves,
whom they found surprisingly alike in a great many things, and then
surprisingly unlike. Dan brought forward some points of identity which
he, and Alice had found in themselves; it was just the same with Miss
Anderson. She found herself rather warm with the seal-skin sacque she
had put on; she let him carry it on his arm while they walked, and
then lay it over her shoulders when they sat down. He felt a pang of
self-reproach, as if he had been inconstant to Alice. This was an old
habit of feeling, formed during the months of their engagement, when, at
her inspiration, he was always bringing himself to book about something.
He replied to her bitterly, in the colloquy which began to hold itself
in his mind, and told her that she had no claim upon him now; that
if his thoughts wandered from her it was her fault, not his; that she
herself had set them free. But in fact he was like all young men, with
a thousand, potentialities of loving. There was no aspect of beauty that
did not tenderly move him; he could not help a soft thrill at the sight
of any pretty shape, the sound of any piquant voice; and Alice had
merely been the synthesis of all that was most charming to this
fancy. This is a truth which it is the convention of the poets and the
novelists to deny; but it is also true that she might have remained the
sum of all that was loveliest if she would; or if she could.

It was chiefly because she would not or could not that his glance
recognised the charm of Miss Anderson’s back hair, both in its straying
gossamer and in the loose mass in which it was caught up under her hat,
when he laid her sacque on her shoulders. They met that afternoon at a
Senator’s, and in the house of a distinguished citizen, to whose wife
Dan had been presented at Mrs. Whittington’s, and who had somehow got
his address, and sent him a card for her evening. They encountered
here with a jocose old friendliness, and a profession of being tired of
always meeting Miss Anderson and Mr. Mavering. He brought her salad and
ice, and they made an appointment for another walk in the morning, if it
was fine.

He carried her some flowers. A succession of fine days followed, and
they walked every morning. Sometimes Dan was late, and explained that
it was his patent-right man had kept him. She was interested in the
patent-right man, whom Dan began to find not quite so simple as at
first, but she was not exacting with him about his want of punctuality;
she was very easy-going; she was not always ready herself. When he began
to beat about the bush, to talk insincerities, and to lose himself in
