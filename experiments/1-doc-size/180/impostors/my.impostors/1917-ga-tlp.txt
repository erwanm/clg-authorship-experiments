Sorcy, in process of organizing, the grand hospital 
of Toul which was shelled by taubes. I was able to 
see the enormous hole dug by the bomb which fell 
very near the building that sheltered our nurses, who 
had but one idea, to run to their wounded and re- 
assure therh. 

"I visited at Nancy a very beautiful hospital, the 
Malgrange, which is almost unique ; it is the Red Cross 
which houses the military hospital. At the instant of 
bombardment, most of the hospitals were vacated;, 
ours, situated outside of the city, gathered in the 
wounded and all the personnel of the military hospital, and it goes very well. 

"I finished my journey with the Vosges, fipinal, 
Belfort, Gerardmer, Bussang, Morvillars; all these 
hospitals which were filled for a long time with the 
wounded from the battles of the Vosges (especially 
our brave Alpines) are quiet now. 

"If I congratulated the nurses of the region of 



 

Verdun upon their endurance, I do not congratulate 
less those of the Vosges upon their constancy; Gerardmer has had very full days — days when one could 
not take a thought to one's self. There is something 
painful, in a way, -in seeing great happenings receding 
from you. We do not hear the cannon any longer, 
the wounded arrive more rarely, we have no longer 
enough to do, we are easily discouraged, we should 
like to be elsewhere and yet one must remain there 
at his post ready in case of need, which may come 
perhaps when it is least expected. 

"I shall have many things still to tell you, but I am 
going to resume my impressions of this little trip in 
a few words. 

"I have been filled with admiration. The word has, 
I believe, fallen many times from my pen, and it will 
fall again and again. I have admired our dear 
wounded, so courageous in their suffering, so gracious 
to all those who visit them ; I have admired the doctors who are making and have made every day, such 
great efforts to organize and to better conditions ; and 
our nurses I have never ceased to admire. When I 
see them I find them just as I hoped, very courageous 
and also very simple. They speak very little of themselves, and a great deal of their wounded; they complain very little of their fatigue, sometimes of not 
having enough to do. They always meet cheerfully 
the material difficulties of their existence as they do 
almost always the moral difficulties which are even 
more difficult. Self-abnegation, attention to their 



 

duty, seem to them so natural that one scarcely dares 
to praise them. 

"There is one thing that I must praise them for 
particularly — that they always seem to keep the beautiful charming coquetry that belongs to every woman. 
I often arrived without warning. I never saw hair 
disarranged or dress neglected. This exterior perfection is, I may say, a distinctive mark of our nurses. 

"And then I like the care with which they decorate 
and beautify their hospital. Everywhere flowers, pic- 
tures, bits of stuff to drape their rooms. At Revigny 
in one of the baraques I saw flowers, simple flowers 
gathered in the neighboring field, so prettily arranged, 
portraits of our generals framed in green. When I 
complimented a nurse, she answered : 'Ah, no ; it is 
not well done; but I hadn't the time to do better.' 

"At Vadelaincourt, a little room was set aside for 
dressings, all done in white with curtains of white 
and two little vases of flowers. What a smiling welcome for the poor wounded who come there! 'The 
arrangement of a room has a great deal of influence 
on the morale of the wounded,' a doctor said to me. 
All this delights me ! 

"I have finished, but I shall think for a long time of 
this journey which has left in my memory unforgettable sights and in my heart very tender impressions. 

"In the Somme, also, our nurses have worked with 
indefatigable ardor, and they go on without relaxation. The poor refugees, which the Germans return 



 

to us often sick and destitute of everything, are received and comforted by our women of the Red Cross. 

"The three societies of the Red Cross — our Society 
for the Relief of the Military Wounded, the Union of 
the Women of France, and the Association of the 
Ladies of France — work side by side under the direction of the Service de Sante. 

"Our Society for the Relief of the Military 
Wounded has actually about seven hundred hospitals, 
which represent sixty thousand beds, where many 
nurses are occupied from morning until night, and 
many of them serve also at the military hospital at the 
Front, and in the Orient (three to four thousand 
nurses). 

"Every day new needs make us create new ceuvres, 
which we organize quickly. 

"The making of bandages and compresses has always been an important work with us. Yards of 
underclothing and linen are continually asked of us 
by our nurses for their sick. The workshops which 
we have opened since the beginning of the war assist 
with work a great number of women who have been 
left by the mobilization of their men without resources. 

"The clubs for soldiers, in Paris especially, give to 
the convalescents and to the men on leave wholesome 
amusement and compensate somewhat for their absent 
families. 

"Just now we are trying to establish an anti-tuberculosis organization to save those of our soldiers who 
have been infected or are menaced. Many hospitals 



 

are already opened for them. At Mentom, on the 
Mediterranean, for the blind tubercular; at Haute- 
ville, in the Department of the Aisne, for the officers 
and soldiers; at La Rochelle, for bone-tuberculosis; 
but the task is enormous. 

"We seek also, and the work is under way, to edu- 
cate intelligently the mutilated, so that they may work 
and have an occupation in the sad life which remains 
to them, and I assure you, chere madame, that so many 
useful things to be done leave very few leisure hours. 
If a little weariness has in spite of everything slipped 
into our hearts, a visit to the hospitals, to the ambulances at the Front, the sight of suffering so bravely, 
I will even say so cheerfully, supported by our soldiers, 
very quickly revives our courage, and brings us back 
our strength and enthusiasm. . . ." 

The Countess de Roussy de Sales (an American 
brought up in Paris) was one of the first of the in- 
firmieres to be mobilized by Madame d'Haussonville 
on the declaration of war. She went to Rheims with 
the troops, standing most of the time, but too much 
enthralled by the spirit of the men to notice fatigue. 
She told me that although they were very sober, even 
grim, she heard not a word of complaint, but constantly the ejaculation: "It is for France and our 
children. What if we die, so long as our children 
may live in peace?" 

At Rheims, so impossible had it been to make adequate preparations with the Socialists holding up every 




projected budget, there were no installations in the 
hospitals but beds. The nurses and doctors were 
obliged to forage in the town for operating tables and 
the hundred and one other furnishings without which 
no hospital can be conducted. And they had little 
time. The wounded came pouring in at once. 
Madame de Roussy de Sales said they were so busy 
it was some time before it dawned on them, in spite of 
the guns, that the enemy was approaching. But 
when women and children and old people began to 
hurry through the streets in a constant procession they 
knew it was only a matter of time before they were 
ordered out. They had no time to think, however; 
much less to fear. 

Finally the order came to evacuate the hospitals and 
leave the town, which at that time was in imminent
