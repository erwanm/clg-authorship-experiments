^' True ; I had forgotten. But whither is all 

this tending", Diego ? She neither will nor can 
marry you. " 

" She both can and will. Will you help me, 
or not ? Because if not I shall proceed without 
you. Only you can make it easier." 

I always gave way to him ; everybody did. 

He was as good as his word. How he man- 
aged, Chonita never knew, but not a half-hour 
after dinner she found herself alone in the canon 
with him, seated among the huge stones cata- 
clysms had hurled there. 

''Why have you brought me here?" she 
asked. 

"To talk with you." 

"But this would be severely censured. 

"Do you care? " 
"'No." 

She looked at him with a curious feeling she 
had had before ; there was something inside of 
his head that she wanted to get at, — something 
that baffled and teased and allured her. She 
wanted to understand him, and she was op- 
pressed by the weight of her ignorance ; she 
had no key to unlock a man like that. With 
one of her swift impulses she told him of what 
she was thinking. 

He smiled, his eyes lighting. " I am more 
than willing you should know all that you 

would be curious about," he said. ''Ask me 
a hundred questions ; I will answer them. " 

She meditated a moment. She never had 
taken sufficient interest in a man before to 
desire to fathom him, and the arts of the Califor- 
nian belle were not those of the tactfully and 
impartially interested woman of to-day. She 
did not know how to begin. 

'*What have you read ?" she asked, at 
length. 

He gave her some account of his library, — a 
large one, — and mentioned many books of 
many nations, of which she had never heard. 

''You have read all those books ? '* 

''There are many long winter nights and 
days in the redwood forests of the northern 
coast." 

"That does not tell me much, — what you 
have read. I feel that it is but one of the many 
items which went to the making up of you. 
You have traveled everywhere, no ? Was it 
like living over again the books of travel ? " 

"Not in the least. Each man travels for 
himself " 

' ' Madame de Sta^l said that traveling was 
sad. Is it so ? " 

' ' To the lover of history it is like food with- 
out salt : imagination has painted an historical 

City with the panorama of a great time ; it 
has been to us a stage for great events. We 
find it a stage with familiar paraphernalia, and 
actors as commonplace as ourselves." 

" It is more satisfactory to stay at home and 
read about it ? " 

''Infinitely, though less expanding.' 

"Then is anything worth while except read- 
ing?" 

' ' Several things ; the pursuit of glory, for one 
thing, and the active occupied life necessary 
for its achievement." 

She leaned forward a little ; she felt that she 
had stumbled nearer to him. "Are you am- 
bitious ? '' she asked. 

' ' For what it compels life to yield ; abstractly, 
not. Ambition is the looting of hell in chase 
of biting flames swirling above a desert of ashes. 
As for posthumous fame, it must be about as 
satisfactory as a draught of ice-water poured 
down the throat of a man who has died on Sa- 
hara. And yet, even if in the end it all means 
nothing, if  from hour to hour we ripe and ripe 
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
still for a quarter-century or so the nettle of 
ambition flagellating our brain may serve to 
make life less uninteresting and more 
satisfactory. The abstraction and absorption of the 

fight, the stinging fear of rivals, the murmur 
of acknowledgment, the shout of compelled 
applause, — they fill the blanks.' 

'' Tell me," she said, imperiously, " what do 
you want ? " 

" Shall I tell you? I never have spoken of 
it to a living soul but Alvarado. Shall I tell it 
to a woman, — and an Iturbi y Moncada? 
Could the folly of man further go ? " 

"If I am a woman I am an Iturbi y Mon- 
cada, and if I am an Iturbi y Moncada I have 
the honor of its generations in my veins." 

''Very good. I believe you would not be- 
tray me, even in the interest of your house. 
Would you ? " 

-No." 

''And I love to talk to you, to tell you what 
I would tell no other. Listen, then. An 
envoy goes to Mexico next week with letters from 
Alvarado, desiring that I be the next governor 
of the Californias, and containing the assurance 
that the Departmental Junta will endorse me. 
I shall follow next month to see Santa Ana 
personally ; I know him well, and he was a friend 
of my father's. I wish to be invested with pe- 
culiar powers ; that is to say, I wish California 
to be practically overlooked while I am governor
and I wish it understood that I shall be 

governor as long as I please. Alvarado will 
hold no office under the Americans, and is as 
ready to retire now as a few years later. Of 
course my predilection for the Americans must 
be carefully concealed both from the Mexican 
government and the mass of the people here : 
Santa Ana and Alvarado know what is bound 
to come ; the Mexicans, generally, retain 
enough interest in the Californias to wish to 
keep them. I shall be the last governor of the 
Department, and I shall employ that period to 
amalgamate the native population so closely 
that they will make a strong contingent in the 
new order of things and be completely under 
my domination. I shall establish a college 
with American professors, so that our youth 
will be taught to think, and to think in English. 
Alvarado has done something for education, 
but not enough ; he has not enforced it, and 
the methods are very primitive. I intend to 
be virtually dictator. With as little delay as 
possible I shall establish a newspaper, — a 
powerful weapon in the hands of a ruler, as 
well as a factor of development. Then I shall 
organize a superior court for the punishment of 
capital crimes. Not that I do not recognize 
the right of a man to kill if his reasons satisfy 
himself, but there can be no subservience to 


authority in a country where murder is 
practically licensed. American immigration will be
