but draw the threads for deshalados, and so 
elaborate was the open-work that the wonder was 
the bride did not have bands and stripes of 
rheumatism. Others fashioned crepes and 
flowered silks and heavy satins into gowns 
with long pointed waists and full flowing skirts, 
some with sleeves of lace and high to the base 
of the throat, others cut to display the plump 
whiteness of the owner. Twelve rebosos were 
made for her ; Dona Trinidad gave her one of 
her finest mantillas ; Chonita, the white satin 
embroidered with poppies, for which she had 
conceived a capricious dislike. She also 
invited Prudencia to take what she pleased from 

her wardrobe ; and Prudencia, who was noth- 
ing if not practical, helped herself to three 
gowns which had been made for Chonita at 
great expense in the city of Mexico, four shawls 
of Chinese crepe, a roll of pineapple silk, and an 
American hat. 

The house until within two weeks of the wed- 
ding was full of visitors, — neighbors whose ran- 
chos lay ten leagues away or nearer, and the 
people of the town ; all of them come to offer 
congratulations, chatter on the corridor by day 
and dance in the sala by night. The court 
was never free of prancing horses pawing the 
ground for eighteen hours at a time under their 
heavy saddles. Dona Trinidad's cooking-girls 
were as thick in the kitchen as ants on an ant- 
hill, for the good things of Casa Grande were 
as famous as its hospitality, and not the least 
of the attractions to the merry visitors. When 
we did not dance at home we danced at the 
neighbors' or at the Presidio. During the last 
two weeks, however, every one went home to 
rest and prepare for the festivities to succeed 
the wedding ; and the old house was as quiet 
as a canon in the mountains. 

Chonita took a lively concern in the prep- 
arations at first, but her interest soon
evaporated, and she spent more and more time in

the little library adjoining her bedroom. She did 
less reading than thinking, however. Once 
she came to me and tried for fifteen minutes to 
draw from me something in Estenega's dis- 
praise ; and when I finally admitted that he had 
a fault or two I thought she would scalp me. 
Still, at this time she was hardly more than fas- 
cinated, interested, tantalized by a mind she 
could appreciate but not understand. If they 
had never met again he would gradually have 
moved backward to the horizon of her memory, 
growing dim and more dim, hovered in a 
cloud-bank for a while, then disappeared into 
that limbo which must exist somewhere for 
discarded impressions, and all would have been 
well.


XVI. 

The evening before the wedding Prudencia 
covered her demure self with black gown and 
reboso, and, accompanied by Chonita, went 
up to the Mission to make her last maiden
confession. Chonita did not go with her into the 
church, but paced up and down the long
corridor of the wing, gazing absently upon the deep 
wild valley and peaceful ocean, seeing little 
beyond the images in her own mind. 

That morning Alvarado and several mem- 
bers of the Junta had arrived, but not Estenega. 
He had come as far as the Rancho Temblor, 
Alvarado explained, and there, meeting some 
old friends, had decided to remain over night 
and accompany them the next day to the 
ceremony. As Chonita had stood on the corridor 
and watched the approach of the Governor's 
cavalcade her heart had beaten violently, and 
she had angrily acknowledged that her 
nervousness was due to the fact that she was about to 
meet Diego Estenega again. When she discovered 
that he was not of the party, she 

turned to me with pique, resentment, and dis- 
appointment in her face. 

" Even if I cannot ever like him," she said, 
'* at least I might have the pleasure of hearing 
him talk. There is no harm in that, even if he 
is an Estenega, a renegade, and the enemy of 
my brother. I can hate him with my heart and 
like him with my mind. And he must have 
cared little to see us again, that he could linger 
for another day." 

'*Iam mad to see Don Diego Estenega," 
said Valencia, her red lips pouting. " Why 
did he, of all others, tarry ? " 

" He is fickle and perverse," I said, — "the 
most uncertain man I know." 

" Perhaps he thought to make us wish to see 
him the more," suggested Valencia. 

"No," I said: "he has no ridiculous van- 
ities. " 

Chonita wandered back and forth behind the 
arches, waiting for Prudencia's long confession 
of sinless errors to conclude. 

''What has a baby like that to confess?" 
she thought, impatiently. "She could ndt sin 
if she tried. She knows nothing of the dark 
storms of rage and hatred and revenge which 
can gather in the breeists of stronger and 
weaker beings. I never knew, either, until

lately ; but the storm is so black I dare not 
face it and carry it to the priest. I am a sort 
of human chaos, and I wish I were dead. I 
thought to forget him, and I see him as plainly 
as on that morning when he told me that it was 
he who would send my brother to prison " 

She stopped short with a little cry. Diego 
Estenega stood before the Mission in the broad 
swath of moonlight. She had heard a horse 
gallop up the valley, but had paid no attention 
to the familiar sound. Estenega had appeared 
as suddenly as if he had arisen from the 
earth. 

"It is I, senorita." He ascended the 
Mission steps. "Do not fear. May I kiss your 
hand ? " 

She gave him her hand, but withdrew it 
hurriedly. Of the tremendous mystery of 
sex she knew almost nothing. Girls were 
brought up in such ignorance in those days 
that many a bride ran home to her mother on 
her wedding night ; and books teach Innocence 
little. But she was fully conscious that there 
was something in the touch of Estenega's lips 
and hand that startled while it thrilled and 
enthralled. 

" I thought you stayed with the Ortegas 
tonight," she said. Oh, blessed conventions I 



 

"I did, — for a few hours. Then I wanted 
to see you, and I left them and came on. At 
Casa Grande I found no one but Eustaquia ; 
every one else had gone to the gardens ; and 
she told me that you were here." 

Chonita's heart was beating as fast as it had 
beaten that morning ; even her hands shook 
a little. A glad wave of warmth rushed over 
her. She turned to him impetuously. "Tell 
me? "she exclaimed. "Why do I feel like 
this for you ? I hate you : you know that. 
There are many reasons, — five ; you counted 
them. And yet I feel excited, almost glad, at 
your coming. This morning I was disap- 
pointed when you did not. Tell me, — you 
know everything, and I so little, — why is it ? "
