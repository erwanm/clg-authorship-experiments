always be before you exactly as I should be by myself. 
And I shall write you now exactly what I have been 
thinking, what is hard and unkind in it, as well as the 
rest. You will learn to know me as a man far from 
perfect, often going astray himself, often feeling wrong 
things, often leading you astray and making you 
wretched. But behind all this there is the thing often 
lost sight of, but always present the iron duty that I 
have, and the force in me which drives me to it. 

All this morning I have been thinking of my book, 
losing myself in it and filling myself with its glory. 
This afternoon I fell to thinking about us ; and thoughts 
which have been lurking in my mind for a long time got 
the upper hand for the first time. They were that I 
did not love you as I ought to, that I could not ; that 
the love which I felt was a thing from my own 
heart, and that it had carried me away because I was 
anxious to persuade myself I had found my ideal upon 
earth ; that you could not satisfy the demands upon 
life that I made, and that if I married you it would 
be to make you wretched, and myself as well ; that you 
had absolutely nothing of the things that I needed, and 
that the life which your nature required was entirely 
different from mine ; that you had no realization of the 
madness that was driving me, could find and give me 
none of the power I needed; and that I ought to write 
and tell you this, no matter what it cost that I owed 
it to the sacr-ed possibility of my own soul, to live alone 
if I could live better alone. And when I had said these 
words, I felt a sense of relief, because they were haunt- 
ing me, and had been for a long time. 

How they will affect you I cannot tell, it depends upon 



 

how deep your love for me is ; certainly they mean for 
me that my love is not deep, that you have not made 
yourself necessary to me. I think that in that last 
phrase I put the whole matter in its essence you have 
not bound yourself to me ; I am always struggling 
to keep my love firm and right, to hold myself to you. 
The result is that there is no food for my soul in the 
thought of our love, in my thought of you ; and there- 
fore, I am continually dissatisfied and doubting, con- 
tinually feeling the difference between the love I have 
dreamed and our love. 

I tried to think the matter out, and get to the very 
bottom of it. The first thing that came to me on the 
other side was your absolute truth; your absolute de- 
votion to what was right and noble in our ideal. So 
that, as I was thinking, I suddenly stopped short with 
this statement "If you cannot find right love with that 
girl, it must be because you do not honor love, or care 
for it." And then I thought of your helplessness, of 
your lack of training and opportunity for growth; 
and I told myself how absurd it was of me to expect 
satisfying love from you when all that I knew about 
in life, and thought of, was entirely unknown to you. 
I realized that I was a man who had tasted more or 
less of all knowledge, and had an infinite vision of 
knowledge yet before him, and an infinite hunger for 
it; and that you were a school-girl, with all of a 
school-girl's tasks on your hands. So I said to myself 
that the reason for the dissatisfaction was a fault of 
my own, that it had come from my own blindness. I 
had gone wrong in my attitude to you ; I had failed in 
my sternness and my high devotion to perfection ; I had 
contented myself with lesser things, had come down from 
my best self, and had failed to make you see what a 



 

task was before you, if you ever meant to know my best 
self. You perceive that this is a return to my old-time 
attitude; I am sorry if it makes you wretched, but I 
cannot help it. It is a surgical operation that must 
be borne. I shall not make it necessary again, I hope. 

Now, dear Corydon, I am not trying to choose 
pleasant words in this letter, this is the way I talk 
to myself. And if anything good comes from our love, 
it will be because of this letter. I challenge what is 
noblest in you to rise to meet the truth of it. I should 
not care to write to you if I did not feel that it would. 

You have had a possibility offered to you, and because 
you are very hungry for life you have clasped it to 
you, placed all your happiness in it. The possibility is 
the love of a man whose heart has been filled with the 
fire of genius. There are few men whom life takes 
hold of as it does me, who sacrifice themselves for their 
duty as I do, who demand experience knowledge, 
power, beauty as I do. There are very few men who 
will wrest out of existence as much as I will, or know 
and have as much of life. I am a boy just now, and 
only beginning to live ; but I have my purpose in hand, 
and I know that if I am given health and life, there 
is nothing that men have known that I shall not know, 
nothing that is done in the world that I shall not do, 
or try to. I have a strong physique, and I labor day 
and night, and always shall. I shall always be hungry 
and restless, always dissatisfied with myself, and with 
everything about me, and acting and feeling most of 
the time like a person haunted by a devil. I make no 
apologies to you for the conceit of what I am saying ; 
it is what I think of myself, without caring what other 
people think. I know that I have a tremendous tempera- 
ment, tremendous powers hidden within me, and they 



 

have got to come out. When they do, the world will 
know what I know now. 

Now Corydon, as you understand, I dream love ab- 
solute, and would scorn any other kind. I can master 
my passion, if it be that upon earth there is no woman 
willing or able to go with me to the last inch of my 
journey. I dream a life-companion to follow wherever 
my duty drives me; to feel all the desperateness of de- 
sire that I feel, to be stern and remorseless as I must 
be, wild and savage as I must be ; to race through 
knowledge with me and to share my passion for truth 
with me ; a woman with whom I need have no shame in 
the duty of my genius ! As I tell you, if I marry you, 
I expect to give myself to you as your own heart; and 
then I think of the gentle and mild existence you have 
led! 

It is very hard for me even to tell about my life, or 
to explain this thing that drives me mad. But I am 
writing this letter to you for the purpose of making 
clear to you that there are two alternatives before you, 
and that you must choose one or the other and stick 
by it, and bear the consequences. It is painful to me 
to think that I have fascinated you by what oppor- 
tunities I have, even by what power and passion and 
talents I have, and filled you with a hunger for me- 
when really you do not realize at all what I am, or 
what I must be, and when what I have to do will terrify 
you. I write in the thought of terrifying you now, 
and making you give up this red-hot iron that you are 
trying to hold on to; or else to show you my life so 
plainly that never afterwards can you blame me, or 
shrink back except by your own fault. 

You must not blame me for writing these words, 
for wondering if a woman, if any woman has power 



 

to stand what I need to do. And when I talk to you 
about giving me up, you must not think that is cold, 
but know that it is my faithfulness to my vision, which 
is the one thing to which I owe any duty in the world. 
Nor is it right that you should expect to be essential 
to me, when I have labored to be all to myself. You 
could become necessary to me in the years to come ; if 
I marry you to-day I shall marry you for what you 
are to become, and for that alone at any rate if I 
am true to myself. 

If you are to be my wife you are to be my soul 
to live my soul's life and bear its pain. You are to 
understand that I talk to you as I talk to myself, call 
you the names I call myself, and if you cry, give you 
up in disgust ; that I am to deny you all pleasure as I
do myself, and what God knows will be ten thousand
