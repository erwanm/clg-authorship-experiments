ask you something." 

" Well, why don't you ? " 

" I want to know if you won't do some 
thing for me." 

" Talk away," said the housekeeper. " I 




 

hear." She went meanwhile getting out the 
flour and things wanted for the shortcake. 

" There's a poor old woman that lives in 
Lilac lane ; Mrs. Eldridge, her name is." 

" Sally Eldridge," said Miss Redwood. 
" La ! I know her. She's poor, as you say." 

" You know where she lives ? " 

" Course I do, child. I know where everybody lives." 

" You know she is very poor ; and her 
house wants cleaning; and she hasn't a great 
many things to be comfortable." 

" How come you to know it ? " asked the 
housekeeper. 

" I have been there. I have seen her. I 
know her very well." 

" Who took you there ? " 

" Nobody took me there. I heard about 
her, and I went to see her." 

" You didn't learn that of the French 
minister." 

" But he is not French, Miss Redwood." 

" I wisht he was," said the housekeeper. 



 

" I say nothin' agin other country people, 
only to be sorry for 'em ; but I get put out o' 
my patience when I see one of the right stock 
makin' a fool of himself. Well honey, what 
about Mis' Eldridge ? " 

" I've got some money, Miss Redwood, 
somebody gave me some money, to get 
things for her and do what I like ; and Norton Laval and I were going to have her made 
nice and comfortable. But now aunt Candy 
will not let me go there any more, and I can't 
do what I wanted to do ; and I thought 
Mr. Richmond thought maybe you would 
see to it for me." 

" What's to be done ? " said the house 
keeper. 

" Why, first of all, Miss Redwood, her 
house wants cleaning. It is not fit to put 
anything nice into it." 

" All Lilac lane wouldn't be the worse of 
a cleanin'," said the housekeeper ; " men and 
women and all; but I don't know who's to do 
the cleanin'." 




" I thought, maybe Sabrina "Rogers would 
do it, if she Was paid, you know. She 
lives just over the way, and she is pretty 
clean." 

" Kin try," said the housekeeper. " No harm 
in tryin'. I guess a dollar would fetch her 
round. Supposin' it was cleaned ; what's to 
do next ? " 

" Get things, Miss Redwood," said Matilda 
looking up at her eagerly. " You know she 
wants so much. I want to get a bedstead 
for her, and a decent bed ; her bed isn't a bed, 
and it lies on the floor. And she has no way 
to wash herself; I want to send her a little 
washstand, and basin and pitcher, and towels ; 
and a table for the other room ; and a saucepan to cook things in ; and some bread and 
meat and sugar and other things; for she 
hasn't comfortable things to eat. And one 
or two calico dresses, you know; she wants 
them so much." 

The child's face grew excitedly eager. 
There came a glitter in the housekeeper's 




faded blue eye as it looked down upon 
her. 

" But honey, all these things'll cost a sight 
o' money." 

" I've got money." 

" It'll take all you've got." 

" But I want to do what I can, Miss Red 
wood." 

" I kind o' don't think it's right," said the 
housekeeper. " Why should you go a spend- 
in' all your little savin's upon Sally Eldridge ? 
And it's only one old woman helped, when 
all's done ; there's lots more. It's somebody 
else that ought to do it; 'tain't your work, 
child." 

" But I want to do it, Miss Redwood. And 
I've got the money." 

" I wonder how much better she'll be at 
the end of six months," said the housekeeper. 
" Well, you want me to take this job in hand, 
do you?" 

" If you can, if you would be so very 
good." 



 

" You make me feel as mean as water," 
said the housekeeper. " It'll take me a little 
while to get up any notion o' my goodness 
again. I suppose it'll come, with the old 
pride o' me. I know what the Bible says, 
but I kind o' didn't think it meant it ; and 
I've been a makin' myself comfortable all my 
days, or workin' for it; and consolin' my 
conscience with thinkin' it was no use to help 
one; but now yours and mine would make 
two ; and somebody else's would ha' been 
three. La ! child, you make me ashamed o' 
myself." 

" But Miss Redwood," said Matilda in 
much surprise, " you are always doing something for somebody ; I don't know what you 
mean." 

" Not this way, child," said the house 
keeper. " I kind o' thought my money was 
my own, after I had worked for it." 

" Well so it is." 

" And so is your'n your'n ; but it looks 
like as if what was your'n was the Lord's. 



 

And to be sure, that's what the minister is
