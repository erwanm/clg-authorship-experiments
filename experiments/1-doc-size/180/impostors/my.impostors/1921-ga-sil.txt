open. 

The breakfast was smoked but not uneatable and the 
strong coffee raised even Mrs. Groome 's wavering spirits. 
They were all talking gayly when James entered ab- 
ruptly. He was very pale. 

"City's doomed, ma'am. Thirty fires broke out simultaneous, and the wind blowing from the southeast. A 
chimney fell on the fire-chief's bed and he can't live. 
People runnin' round like their heads was cut off and 
thousands pouring out of the city — over to Oakland and 
Berkeley. Lootin' was awful and General Funston has 
ordered out the troops. Pipes broken and not a drop of 
water. They're goin' to dynamite, but only the 
fire-chief knew how. Everybody says the whole city'll go. 
Doomed, that's what it is. Better let me tell Mike to 
harness up and drive you down to San Mateo. ' ' 

Mrs. Groome had also turned pale, but she cut a piece 
of bacon with resolution in every finger of her large-veined hands. 

"I do not believe it, and I shall not run— like those 
people south of Market Street. I shall stay until the last 
minute at all events. The roads at least cannot bum." 

"This house ought to be safe enough, ma'am, standin' 
quite alone on this hill as it does; but it's a question of 
food. We never keep much of anything in the house, 
beyond what's needed for the week, and the California 
Market's right in the fire zone. And the smoke will be 
something terrible when the fire gets closer. ' ' 

"I shall stay in my own house. There are grocery 
stores and butcher shops in Fillmore Street. Go and 



 

buy all you can." She handed him a buneh of keys. 
"You will find money in my escritoire. Tell the maids 
to fill the bathtubs while there is any water left in the 
mains. You may go if you are frightened, but I stay 
here." 

"Very well, and you needn't have said that, ma'am. 
I've been in this family, man and boy, Ballinger and 
Groome, for fifty -two years, and you know I'd never 
desert you. But no doubt those hussies in the kitchen 
will, with a lot of others. A lot of stoves have already 
been set up in the streets out here and ladies are cookin' 
their own breakfasts. ' ' 

' ' Forgive me, James. I know you will never leave me. 
And if the others do we shall get along. Miss Alexina 
is not a bad cook." And she heroically swallowed the 
bacon. 

IV 

James departed and she turned to Dwight, who was on 
his feet. 

"You are not going?" 

"I think I must, Mrs. Groome. There may be something I can do down there. AU able-bodied men will be 
needed, I fancy." 

"But you'll come back and see us?" cried Alexina. 

"Indeed I will. I'll report regularly." 

He thanked Mrs. Groome for her hospitality and she 
invited him to take pot luck with her at dinner time. 
After he had gone Alexina exclaimed rapturously : 

"Oh, you do like him, don't you, mommy dear?" 

And Mrs. Groome was pleased to reply, "He has perfect manners and certainly has the right ideas about 
things. I could do no less than ask him to dinner if he 
is going to take the trouble to bring us the news." 



 



THAT was a uniqae and vivid day for young Alexina 
Groome, whose disposition was to look upon life as 
drama and asked only that it shift its scenes often and 
be consistently entertaining and picturesque. 

Never, so James told her, since her Grandmother Ballinger's reign, had there been such life and movement in 
the old house. AU Mrs. Groome 's intimate friends and 
many of Alexina 's came to it, some to make kindly inquiries, others to beg them to leave the city, many to 
gossip and exchange experiences of that fateful morning; 
a few from Rincon Hill and the old ladies' fashionable 
boarding-house district to claim shelter until they could 
make their way to relatives out of town. 

Mrs. Groome welcomed her friends not only with the 
more spontaneous hospitality of an older time but in that 
spirit of brotherhood that every disaster seems to release, however temporarily. Brotherhood is unquestion- 
ably an instinct of the soul, an inheritance from that 
sunrise era when mutual interdependence was as imperative as it was automatic. The complexities of civilization have overlaid it, and almost but not wholly replaced 
it by national and individual selfishness. But the world 
as yet is only about one-third civilized. Centuries hence 
a unified civilization may complete the circle, but human nature and progress must act and react a thousand 
times before the earthly millenium ; and it cannot be hastened by dreamers and fanatics. 

All Mrs. Groome 's spare rooms were placed at the 
service of her friends, and cots were bought in the humble 
Fillmore Street shops and put up iu the billiard room, 
the double parlors, the library and the upper hall. Some 
forty people would sleep under the old Ballinger roof 
that night — dynamite permitting. Mrs. Groome was 
firm in her determination not to flee, and as James and 
Mike were there to watch, she had graciously given a 



 

number of the gloomy refugees from the lower regions 
permission to camp in the outhouses and grounds. 



Alexina spent the greater part of the day with Aileen 
Lawton, Olive Baseom, and Sibyl Thomdyke, out of 
doors, fascinated by the spectacle of the burning city. 

The valley beyond Market Street, and the lower business district, were a rolling mass of smoke parting about 
pillars of fire, shot with a million glittering sparks when 
a great building was dynamited. All the windows in 
those sections of the city as yet beyond the path of the 
fire were open, for although closed windows might have 
shut out the torrid atmosphere, the explosions would have 
shattered them. 

"Oh, dear," sighed Olive Baseom, "there goes my 
building. The smoke lifted for a moment and I saw the 
flames spouting out of the windows. A cool million and 
uninsured. We thought Class A buildings were safe 
from any sort of fire. " 

' ' Heavens ! ' ' exclaimed Alexina naively, ' ' I wish I had 
a million-dollar building down in that furnace. It must 
be a great sensation to watch a million dollars go up in 
sparks." 

"I hope your mother hasn't any buildings down in 
the business district," said Aileen anxiously. "I've 
heard dad talk about her ground rents. She'll get those 
agaiii soon enough. I fancy the old tradition survives 
in this town and they'll begin to draw the plans for 
the new city before the fire is out. It used to bum down 
regularly in the fifties, dad says. ' ' 

"I don't fancy we have much of anything," said 
Alexina cheerfully. ' ' I think mother has only a life interest in a part of father's estate, and I heard her tell 
Maria once that she intended to leave me all she had of 
her own, this place and a few thousand a year in bonds 
and some flats that are probably burning up right now. 
I gathered from the conversation that father didn't have 
much left when he died and that it was understood 



 

mother was to look out for me. I believe he gave a look 
to the others when he was wealthy. ' ' 

"Good Lord!" Aileen sighed heavily. "It won't pa: 
your dressmakers' bills, what with taxes and all. I won' 
be much better off. We'll have to marry Eex Roberts or
Bob Cheever or Frank Bascom — unless he's going up 
smoke too, Olive dear. But there are a few others."
