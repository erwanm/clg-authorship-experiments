Peel the onions, boil tender, press the water from them, and mince
fine. Have ready the hot milk in a saucepan; stir in the onions, then
the butter, salt, and pepper. Boil up once.

If you want to have it particularly good, make nice melted or drawn
butter (No. 3); beat the mashed onion into it; add a teacupful of
cream or new milk, season, boil up, and serve.


MAÎTRE D’HÔTEL SAUCE. 

    1 teacupful drawn butter.
    1 teaspoonful minced parsley.
    1 lemon.
    Cayenne and salt to taste.

Draw the butter (No. 2); boil the parsley three minutes; take it out
and lay in cold water five minutes, to cool; chop and stir into the
butter; squeeze in the lemon-juice, the pepper and salt; beat hard with
an egg-whip, return to the fire, and boil up once.

This is a “stock” sauce, being suitable for so many dishes, roast or
boiled.


MINT SAUCE FOR ROAST LAMB.

    2 tablespoonfuls green mint, chopped fine.
    1 tablespoonful powdered sugar.
    Half a teacupful cider vinegar.

Chop the mint, put the sugar and vinegar in a sauce boat, and stir in
the mint. Let it stand in a cool place fifteen minutes before sending
to table.


MUSHROOM SAUCE.

    1 teacupful young mushrooms.
    4 tablespoonfuls butter.
    1 teacupful cream or milk.
    1 teaspoonful flour.
    Nutmeg, mace, and salt to taste.

Stew the mushrooms in barely enough water to cover them until tender.
Drain, but do not press them, and add the cream, butter, and seasoning.
Stew over a bright fire, stirring all the while until it begins to
thicken. Add the flour wet in cold milk, boil up and serve in a boat,
or pour over boiled chickens, rabbits, etc.


CAULIFLOWER SAUCE.

    1 small cauliflower.
    3 tablespoonfuls butter, cut in bits, and rolled in flour.
    1 onion.
    1 small head of celery.
    Mace, pepper, and salt.
    1 teacupful water.
    1 teacupful milk or cream.

Boil the cauliflower in two waters, changing when about half done, and
throwing away the first, reserve a teacupful of the last. Take out the
cauliflower, drain and mince. Cook in another saucepan the onion and
celery, mincing them when tender. Heat the reserved cupful of water
again in a saucepan, add the milk; when warm put in the cauliflower and
onion, the butter and seasoning—coating the butter thickly with flour;
boil until it thickens.

This is a delicious sauce for boiled corned beef and mutton.


ASPARAGUS SAUCE.

    A dozen heads of asparagus.
    2 teacupfuls drawn butter.
    2 eggs.
    The juice of half a lemon.
    Salt and white pepper.

Boil the tender heads in a very little salted water. Drain and chop
them. Have ready a pint of drawn butter, with two raw eggs beaten into
it; add the asparagus, and season, squeezing in the lemon-juice last.
The butter must be hot, but do not cook after putting in the asparagus
heads. This accompanies boiled fowls, stewed fillet of veal, or boiled
mutton.


APPLE SAUCE.

Pare, core, and slice some ripe tart apples, stew in water enough to
cover them until they break to pieces. Beat up to a smooth pulp, stir
in a good lump of butter, and sugar to taste.

Apple sauce is the invariable accompaniment of roast pork—or fresh pork
cooked in any way. If you wish, you can add a little nutmeg.


PEACH SAUCE.

Soak a quart of dried peaches in water four hours. Wash them, rubbing
them against one another by stirring around with a wooden spoon. Drain,
and put into a saucepan with just enough water to cover them. Stew
until they break to pieces. Rub to a soft smooth pulp, sweeten to taste
with white sugar. Send to table cold, with roast game or other meats.


CRANBERRY SAUCE.

Wash and pick a quart of ripe cranberries, and put into a saucepan with
a teacupful of water. Stew slowly, stirring often until they are thick
as marmalade. They require at least an hour and a half to cook. When
you take them from the fire, sweeten abundantly with white sugar. If
sweetened while cooking, the color will be bad. Put them into a mould
and set aside to get cold.


Or, 

And this is a nicer plan—strain the pulp through a cullender or sieve,
or coarse mosquito-net, into a mould wet with cold water. When firm,
turn into a glass dish or salver. Be sure that it is sweet enough.

Eat with roast turkey, game, and roast ducks.


TO BROWN FLOUR.

Spread upon a tin plate, set upon the stove, or in a very hot oven,
and stir continually after it begins to color, until it is brown all
through.

Keep it always on hand. Make it at odd minutes, and put away in a glass
jar, covered closely. Shake up every few days to keep it light and
prevent lumping.


TO BROWN BUTTER.

Put a lump of butter into a hot frying-pan, and toss it around over a
clear fire until it browns. Dredge browned flour over it, and stir to
a smooth batter until it begins to boil. Use it for coloring gravies,
such as brown fricassees, etc.; or make into sauce for baked fish and
fish-steaks, by beating in celery or onion vinegar, a very little
brown sugar and some cayenne.



CATSUPS AND FLAVORED VINEGARS.


MADE MUSTARD. 

    4 tablespoonfuls best English mustard.
    2 teaspoonfuls salt.
    2 teaspoonfuls white sugar.
    1 teaspoonful white pepper.
    2 teaspoonfuls salad oil.
    Vinegar to mix to a smooth paste—celery or Tarragon vinegar if you
        have it.
    1 small garlic, minced very small.

Put the mustard in a bowl and wet with the oil, rubbing it in with a
silver or wooden spoon until it is absorbed. Wet with vinegar to a
stiff paste; add salt, pepper, sugar, and garlic, and work all together
thoroughly, wetting little by little with the vinegar until you
can beat it as you do cake-batter. Beat five minutes very hard; put
into wide-mouthed bottles—empty French mustard bottles, if you have
them—pour a little oil on top, cork tightly, and set away in a cool
place. It will be mellow enough for use in a couple of days.

Having used this mustard for years in my own family, I can safely
advise my friends to undertake the trifling labor of preparing it in
consideration of the satisfaction to be derived from the condiment.
I mix in a Wedgewood mortar, with pestle of the same; but a bowl is
nearly as good. It will keep for weeks.
