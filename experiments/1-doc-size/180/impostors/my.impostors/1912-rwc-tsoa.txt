"I'm afraid not, Dankmere."

"Very well," said the Earl, airily. "I'm not worrying now, you know.
Good-bye, old sport!"

And he rang off.

Quarren meeting Molly in the hall said:

"I think I'd better leave this afternoon. Dankmere is messing matters."

"Are you going to run away?" she said in a low voice, glancing sideways
at Strelsa who had just passed them wearing her riding habit.

"Run away," he repeated, also lowering his voice. "From whom?"

"From Langly Sprowl."

He shrugged and looked out of the window.

"It is running away," insisted his pretty hostess. "You have a chance
I think."

"Not the slightest."

"You are wrong. Strelsa wept in her sleep all night. How does that
strike you?"

"Not over me," he said grimly; but added: "How do you know she did?"

"Her maid told mine," admitted Molly shamelessly. "Now if you are going
to criticise my channels of information I'll remind you that Richelieu
himself----"

"Oh, Molly! Molly! What a funny girl you are!" he said, laughing.
"You're a sweet, loyal little thing, too--but there's no use--" His face
became expressionless, almost haggard--"there's no use," he repeated
under his breath.

Slowly, side by side, they walked out to the veranda, her hand resting
lightly just within the crook of his arm, he, absent-mindedly filling
his pipe.

"Strelsa likes you," she said.

"With all the ardour and devotion of a fish," he returned, coolly.

"Rix?"

"What?"

"Do you know," said Molly, thoughtfully, "she is a sort of a fish. She
has the emotions of a mollusc as far as your sex is concerned. Some
women are that way--more women than men would care to believe.... Do
you know, Ricky, if you'll let us alone, it is quite natural for us to
remain indifferent to considerations of that sort?"

She stood watching the young fellow busy with his pipe.

"It's only when you keep at us long enough that we respond," she said.
"Some of us are quickly responsive; it takes many of us a long while to
catch fire. Threatened emotion instinctively repels many of us--the more
fastidious among us, the finer grained and more delicately nerved, are
essentially reserved. Modesty, pride, a natural aloofness, are as much a
part of many women as their noses and fingers----"

"What becomes of modesty and pride when a girl marries for money?" he
asked coolly.

"Some women can give and accept in cold blood what it would be
impossible for them to accord to a more intimate and emotional demand."

"No doubt an ethical distinction," he said, "but not very clear to me."

"I did not argue that such women are admirable or excusable.... But how
many modern marriages in our particular vicinity are marriages of
inclination, Ricky?"

"You're a washed-out lot," he said--"you're satiated as schoolgirls. If
you have any emotions left they're twisted ones by the time you are
introduced. Most d√©butantes of your sort make their bow equipped for
business, and with the experience of what, practically, has amounted to
several seasons.

"If any old-fashioned young girls remain in your orbit I don't know
where to find them. Why, do you suppose any young girl, not yet out,
would bother to go to a party of any sort where there was not champagne
and a theatre-box and a supper in prospect? That's a fine comment on
your children, Molly, but you know it's true and so does everybody who
pretends to know anything about it."

"You talk like Karl Westguard," she said, laughing. "Anyway, what has
all this to do with you and Strelsa Leeds?"

"Nothing." He shrugged. "She is part of your last word in social
civilisation----"

"She is a very normal, sensitive, proud girl, who has known little
except unhappiness all her life, Rix--including two years of marital
misery--two years of horror.--And you forget that those two years were
the result of a demand purely and brutally emotional--to which, a
novice, utterly ignorant, she yielded--pushed on by her mother....
Please be fair to her; remember that her childhood was pinched with
poverty, that her girlhood in school was a lonely one, embarrassed by
lack of everything which her fashionable schoolmates had as matters of
course.

"She could not go to the homes of her schoolmates in vacation times,
because she could not ask them, in turn, to her own. She was still in
school when Reggie Leeds saw her--and misbehaved--and the poor little
thing was sent home, guiltless but already half-damned. No wonder her
mother chased Reggie Leeds half around the world dragging her daughter
by the wrist!"

"Did it make matters any better to force that drunken cad into a
marriage?" asked Quarren coldly.

"It makes another marriage possible for Strelsa."

Quarren gazed out across the country where a fine misty rain was still
falling. Acres of clover stretched away silvered with powdery moisture;
robins and bluebirds covered the soaked lawns, and their excited
call-notes prophesied blue skies.

"It doesn't make any difference one way or the other," said Quarren,
half to himself. "She will go on in the predestined orbit----"

"Not if a stronger body pulls her out of it."

"There is nothing to which she responds--except what I have not."

"Make what you do possess more powerful, then."

"What do I possess?"

"Kindness. And also manhood, Ricky. Don't you?"

"Perhaps so--now--after a fashion.... But I am not the man who could
ever attract her----"

"Wake her, and find out."

"Wake her?"

"Didn't I tell you that many of us are asleep, and that few of us awake
easily? Didn't I tell you that nobody likes to be awakened from the warm
comfort and idle security of emotionless slumber?--that it is the
instinct of many of us to resist--just as I hear my maid speak to me in
the morning and then turn over for another forty winks, hating her!"

They both laughed.

"My maid has instructions to persist until I respond," said Molly.
"Those are my instructions to you, also."

"Suppose, after all, I were knocking at the door of an empty room?"

"You must take your chances of course."

There was a noise of horses on the gravel: Langly cantered up on a
handsome hunter followed by a mounted groom leading Strelsa's mare.

Sprowl dismounted and came up to pay his respects to Molly, scarcely
troubling himself to recognise Quarren's presence, and turning his back
to him immediately, although Molly twice attempted to include him in the
conversation.

Strelsa in the library, pulling on her gloves, was silent witness to a
pantomime unmistakable; but her pretty lips merely pressed each other
tighter, and she sauntered out, crop under one arm, with a careless
greeting to Langly.

He came up offering his hand and she took it, then stood a moment in
desultory conversation, facing the others so as to include Quarren.
