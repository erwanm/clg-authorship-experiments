wait on every turn, as she had been in Miss Madeira's sim- 
ple cottage. All refined and cultured ways came to her 
instinctively. 

" She might have lived in a palace all her life," said 
Roger admiringly to his aunt. " Isn't it astonishing ? And 
though she thinks she's fearfully ignorant, I wonder where 
she picked up so much knowledge ! Why, we could take 
her anywhere without a bit of polishing. And then her 
lovely voice ! " 

She amazed Roger still more, one morning, by running 
over a rather difficult exercise very correctly. 

Well, you are a marvel ! " he exclaimed. " Did you 
learn piano-playing in that fairy-ring, with the small people? 
I begin to think you a trifle uncanny." 





" Oh, don't laugh at me," and she raised her lovely eyes 
with that shy, deprecating look so absolutely bewitching ; 
"I did have a teacher. And we had a piano." 

" We ? Who, pray tell ! You have been in so many 
phases of existence." 

" At Miss Madeira's." And then came out the story of 
the ill-fated piano. 

"See here ! " exclaimed Roger. M You don't mean that 
you are to lose all that money unless you redeem it by 
July ? The fellow is a mean old hunks, anyhow. Now 
I'll tell you what we will do. You just put on a hat, and 
I'll order the carriage, and we will go and pay this bill, 
and have the piano sent back in a jiffy." 

"You " with startled surprise in every line of her 
sweet face. 

" Yes. I have a Fortunatus purse maybe you didn't 
know it ? My dear, generous Fortunatus is in California, 
the best and loveliest prince in the wide world. I mean 
you to see him some day. And he thinks, funniest of all, 
that I am only a little boy yet, and can hardly be trusted 
away from aunt Alice's motherly wing, though I have 
been all over Europe. And so we will go out and try our 
enchantment on this piano." 

It was the first time she had been out alone with him. 
He was so gay and fascinating that she listened to his 
bright sallies, and laughed, her own low, musical ripple. 

When that business was satisfactorily adjusted they went 
to call on Miss Madeira, dear old Miss Madeira, who had 
cried more longing tears for Queenie than she would have 
liked to admit, though she gave thanks every hour for the 
good fortune. And then Roger declared he would bring 
the great family carriage around the next morning, and 
take out the whole host for a frolic. 

What a grand, rare frolic it was ! The children, Miss 
Madeira declared, were "let loose." Moppet did put on a 
few " big girl " airs, but Pug was too riotous, and the twins 





so solemnly funny. They went rcund and round the drives, 
viewed the animals; they had a grand feast of refresh- 
ments ; and it was two o'clock before Roger set them down 
at their own door. 

" How very, very good you are to take so much trouble 
for " and Queenie blushed enchantingly. 

" A noisy crew of youngsters ! And yet they are very 
'likable.' How they all adore you. And that quaint Miss 
Madeira ! Do you know I feel like screaming with laugh- 
ter when she claps her decapitated sentences together, like 
the man did his dog, with two legs up and two legs down." 

Queenie laughed, too. 

" There, what are you thinking of now ? You have the 
most wonderful face. Did you ever see a great field of 
waving grass or grain on a summer day, when some tiny 
cloud drifted over the sun ? Here there will be a dimple 
of shade, there a bit of sun, and both rippling over it as if 
they were playing hide-and-seek. And that's just the way 
the beautiful changes go over your face," and Roger's 
glance seemed to devour it. 

She was quite grave then. 

" I was thinking," she said, "of the time when we first 
came to New York. I used to take the twins up to the 
Park in a baby-carriage, and watch the great people who 
went riding by, in their beautiful attire. And I used to 
plan that if I ever did get rich I'd stop by the wayside 
and take in some stray, forlorn child, and give it such a 
long, lovely ride. And now you have done it, oh, Mr. 
Lasselle, I can never, never tell you how I appreciate your 
kindness," and the tears made limpid lakes of her tender 
eyes. 

" See here," he said, much moved by the strand of pathos 
in her voice, " you have been adopted in the bosom of the 
family, and we can't help calling you Queenie; so you 
must say Roger, and Lai, and aunt Alice, and uncle Ed- 
ward. Begin with Roger, won't you?" , 





A scarlet light flashed up in her face, and her eyes were 
shyly downcast. She said it softly, under her breath, and 
he almost guessed that she did by the quiver of the lips. 

Aunt Alice scolded a little at Roger's keeping her out 
so long. Maggie wanted to alter a white dress, and there 
was to be company to dinner. 

"Lai's betrothed," explained Roger; "so you see, Miss 
Queenie, you have a powerful rival in that young man's 
affections. He will have no eyes nor ears for any one but 
her, and I must take you in to dinner. Maggie, make her 
outshine everybody." 

Queenie did not ask any questions. The sudden remem- 
brance flashed over her that a week ago she too had a 
lover. Did she regret him ? 

Her heart was in a complex state. How much duty she 
owed Harry Grenville, now that she had the birth and 
wealth of his station, she could not decide. There was 
the taint of the stage still, and that his grandmother had 
so bitterly denounced. If she could only summon the 
requisite courage to confess to Mrs. Byington, and let her 
decide what would be right. Madame Denzil had gone to 
Chicago, Miss Madeira had been purposely left in igno- 
rance of her abode. And every one was so completely 
engrossed with Queenie's affairs that Miss Grenville had 
not been discussed. On the other hand, Lawrence had 
been occupied with his fair betrothed, and her speedy de- 
parture, and their own interests were sufficient for them. 
Thus it happened that the name of Grenville had not been 
mentioned. 

Queenie stood in the doorway, radiantly beautiful in her 
fine white organdie, with a pale-green sash and her loose- 
flowing curls fastened at the back with a knot of the same 
color, while at her throat was a cluster of pale pink rose- 
buds. 

" Come," Roger said, quite entranced with her love- 
liness. "They are all here, and aunt Alice bade m 





bring you down," slipping her unresisting hand through 
his arm. 

She entered the spacious drawing-room unabashed. Here 
sat a pale, thin, aristocratic-looking old gentleman, a very 
picture, in a crimson velvet chair ; a middle-aged, rather 
faded woman beside him, two tall, blooming girls and 
then Queenie's breath came in a great frightened bound, 
and the room seemed full of glittering stars. 

"Miss Waldeburgh," Mrs. Byington had announced. 
"Mr. Grenville, my dear," to Queenie, "Mrs. Grenville, 
Miss Grenville, and Miss Blanche, and" turning her quite 
around " Madame Grenville."
