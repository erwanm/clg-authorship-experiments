culty as the case might require. He started to carry 
out his purpose, when he happened to look through 
one of the saloon windows, and discovered Ethan, 



 



with the handkerchief in his mouth, tied to the 
stanchion. Deeply as he sympathized with his friend 
in his unpleasant position, he was still cheered by 
the sight, for it assured him that the engineer had 
been faithful to his duties, and was not a party to 
the conspiracy. 

The little captain went round and entered the 
saloon by the door, without being seen by either 
of the conspirators. He removed the gag from 
Ethan's mouth, and proceeded to unfasten the cords 
with which he was bound. 

" What does all this mean, Ethan ? " demanded 
Lawry, in excited tones, and almost crying with 
vexation. 

" Hush ! Do they know you are here ? " asked 
the engineer. 

" I think not ; I don't know." 

" Keep still, then. They are after the gold." 

" Who are they ? " 

" Ben and two other fellows. I don't know 
them." 

" We'll stop this thing very quick," said Lawry, 
in hurried tones. 



 

" They are armed with pistols, and threatened to 
shoot all hands. Be careful, Lawry, or you will 
get a bullet through your head." 

" What shall we do ? " demanded the young pilot, 
who had no desire to be shot. 

Ethan was an accomplished strategist ; he had 
fought the Indians both with his wits and his weap- 
ons, and he promptly undertook the management 
of the affair. He led the way to the lower cabin, 
where the terrified women had been driven by 
the ruffians. Mrs. Light declared she was fright- 
ened out of her senses, and she " never did hear 
of such goings on." 

" If any of those men ask for me, tell them I 
got loose, jumped overboard, and swam ashore," 
said Ethan. 

" Law sake ! " exclaimed the cook. 

" Don't tell them I am here, at any rate." 

" I won't. Massy sake ! What on airth are we 
comin' to ? " 

" Don't be alarmed ; we will take care of these 
villains before we have done with them," added 
Ethan. 

 



 



" Hush ! There's some one coming," said one of 
the girls ; and the heavy tread of a man was heard 
on the deck above them. 

Ethan and Lawry had only time to crawl into 
one of the berths, where Mrs. Light covered them 
with bed-clothes, before Flint came down into the 
cabin. 

" See here ; we haven't been to supper, and we 
want some," said the ruffian, as he descended the 
steps. 

" What are you goin' to do with us ? " demanded 
Mrs. Light. 

" Don't be scart ; we won't hurt you," replied 
Flint. 

" But where you goin' ? " 

" Up to Whitehall. When we get there, you can 
go where you please. Now, get us some supper ; 
the best there is on board â€” beefsteak and coffee." 

" Well, I suppose I can get you some supper ; 
but I don't like such carryin's on," replied Mrs. 
Light. 

Flint left the cabin, after he had given his order. 
On his way forward he looked into the saloon, and 



 

discovered that their prisoner was missing. Search 
was immediately instituted ; but Mrs. Light, as in- 
structed by Ethan, declared that he had got loose, 
and swam ashore ; she had seen him through the 
stern lights. The rascals finally accepted this ex- 
planation, after searching on deck for him. 

Mrs. Light went to the kitchen to get supper for 
the rogues, while the girls set the table. The cook 
presently returned to the cabin, and told Ethan 
where each of the robbers was stationed ; but being 
unarmed, there seemed to be no way of making an 
attack upon them where the ruffians could not rally 
to the support of each other. 

" We must settle this business down here, Lawry," 
said Ethan, when they had come out of their hiding- 
places. 

" They will have to come to supper one at a 
time," added the little captain. 

" Exactly so ; and this will be the safest place 
to do the job. We want a rope," added the en- 
gineer, with a business-like air. 

" I'll fetch you a rope," said Mrs. Light. 

" Do ; bring me the small heave-line, on the 
guard by the saloon doors." 







The cook went on deck, and after a visit to the 
kitchen, returned to the cabin with the line indi- 
cated under her apron. In about half an hour sup- 
per was ready for the villains, and one of the girls 
informed Baker, who was still on duty in the engine- 
room, that it was waiting for them. The engineer 
called Flint, and told him, as the boat was out in 
the middle of the lake, the engine would need noth- 
ing done to it, and directed him to stand at the 
door, so that the fireman below should not attempt 
to defeat their plans. He then went to the cabin 
for his supper. 

Ethan and Lawry had concealed themselves be- 
hind the curtains of a tier of berths, directly in the 
rear of the chair where Baker was to sit at the 
table. In his hand Ethan held the heave-line, at 
one end of which Lawry had made a hangman's 
noose. Mrs. Light and the girls had been instructed 
to rattle the chairs, make as much noise as they 
could, and otherwise engage the attention of the 
robber, as soon as he sat down to the table.
