begin with them. The Leightons didn't come ? " 

" I sent them cards. I couldn't call again." 

Mrs. Horn sighed a little. "I suppose Mr. 
Dryfoos is one of your fellow-philanthropists ? " 

" He 's one of the workers," said Margaret. " I 


met him several times at the Hall, but I only knew 
his first name. I think he 's a great friend of Father 
Benedict ; he seems devoted to the -work. Don't 
you think he looks rjood ? " 

"Very," said Mrs, Horn,  with a colour of censure 
in her assent. "The younger girl seemed more 
amiable than her sister. But what manners ! " 

"Dreadful !" said Margaret, witli knit brows, and 
a pursed mouth of humorous suffering. "But she 
appeared to feel very much at home." 

"Oh, as to that, neither of them was much 
abashed. Do you suppose Mr. Beaton gave the 
other one some hints for that quaint dress of hers ? 
I don't imagine that black and lace is her own 
invention. She seems to have some sort of strange 
fascination for him. ' 

"She's very picturesque," Margaret explained. 
" And artists see points in people that the rest of 
las don't." 

"Could it be her money ?" Mrs. Horn insinuated. 
" He must be very poor." 

"But he isn't base," retorted the girl with a 
generous indignation that made her aunt smile. 

" Oh no ; but if he fancies her so picturesque, it 
doesn't follow that he would object to her being rich." 

" It would with a man like Mr. Beaton ! " 

" You are an idealist, Margaret. I suppose your 
Mr. March has some disinterested motive in paying 
court to Miss Mela — Pamela, I suppose, is her name. 
He talked to her longer than her literature would 
have lasted." 



  

"He seems a very kind person," said Margaret. 

" And Mr. Dryfoos pays his salary ? " 

"I don't know anything about that. But that 
wouldn't make any difference with him." 

Mrs, Horn laughed out at this security ; but she 
was not displeased by the nobleness which it came 
from. She liked Margaret to be high-minded, and 
was really not distressed by any good that was in 
her. 

The Marches walked home, both because it was 
not far, and because they must spare in carriage hire 
at any rate. As soon as they were out of the house, 
she applied a point of conscience to him. 

"I don't see how you could talk to that girl so 
long, Basil, and make her laugh so." 

" Why, there seemed no one else to do it, till I 
thought of Kendricks." 

" Yes, but I kept thinking, Now he 's pleasant to 
her because he thinks it 's to his interest. If she 
had no relation to Every Other Week, he wouldn't 
waste his time on her." 

" Isabel," March complained, " I wish you wouldn't 
think of me in he, hini, and his : I never personalise 
you in my thoughts : you remain always a vague 
unindividualised essence, not quite without form and 
void, but nounloss and pronounless. I call that a 
much more beautiful mental attitude toward the 
object of one's affections. But if you must he and 
him and his me in your thoughts, I wish you 'd have 
more kindly thoughts of me." 



  

" Do you deny that it 's true, Basil ? " 

" Do you believe that it 's true, Isabel ? " 

" No matter. But could you excuse it if it were ? " 

" Ah, I see you 'd have been capable of it in my 
place, and you're ashamed." 

" Yes," sighed the wife, " I 'm afraid that I should. 
But tell me that yoii, wouldn't, Basil ! " 

" I can tell you that I wasn't. But I suppose that 
in a real exigency, I could truckle to the proprietary 
Dryfooses as well as you." 

" Oh no ; you mustn't, dear ! I 'm a woman, and 
I 'm dreadfully afraid. But you must always be a 
man, especially with that horrid old Mr. Dryfoos. 
Promise me that you 'll never yield the least point 
to him in a matter of right and wrong ! " 

" Not, if he 's right and I 'm wrong ? " 

" Don't trifle, dear ! You know what I mean. 
AYill you promise ? " 

" I 'll promise to submit the point to you, and let 
you do the yielding. As for me, I shall be adamant. 
Nothing I like better." 

"They're dreadful, even that poor, good young 
fellow, who 's so different from all the rest ; he 's 
awfid, too, because you feel that he 's a martyr to 
them." 

"And I never did like martyrs a great deal," 
March interposed. 

"I wonder how they came to be there," Mrs. 
March pursued, unmindful of his joke. 

"That is exactly what seemed to be puzzling 
Miss Mela about us. She asked, and I explained 



  

as well as I could ; and then she told me that 
Miss Vance had come to call on them and invited 
them ; and first they didn't know how they could 
come till they thought of making Conrad bring 
them. But she didn't say why Miss Vance called 
on them. Mr. Dryfoos doesn't employ her on Every 
Other JFcck. But I suppose she has her own A'ile 
little motive." 

" It can't be their money ; it canH be ! " sighed 
Mrs. March. 

"Well, I don't know. We all respect money." 

" Yes, but Miss Vance's position is so secure. She 
needn't pay court to those stupid, vulgar people." 

" Well, let 's console ourselves with the belief that 
she would, if she needed. Such people as the 
Dryfooses are the raw material of good society. It 
isn't made up of refined or meritorious people — 
professors and litterateurs, ministers and musicians, 
and their families. All the fashionable people there 
to-night were like the Dryfooses a generation or 
two ago. I dare say the material works up faster 
now, and in a season or two you won't know the 
Dryfooses from the other plutocrats. They will — 
a little better than they do now ; they 'll see a 
difference, but nothing radical, nothing painful. 
People who get up in the world by service to others 
— through letters, or art, or science — may have 
their modest little misgivings as to their social value, 
but people that rise by money — especially if their
