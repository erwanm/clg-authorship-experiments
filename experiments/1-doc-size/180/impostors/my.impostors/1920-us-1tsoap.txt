a manicure parlor. Her idea of fun corresponded to Peter’s, and
Peter spent all the money he had that Saturday evening, and made up
his mind that if he could get something new on the Reds in the
course of the week, he would strike McGivney for forty dollars.

Next morning was Easter Sunday, and Peter met his manicurist by
appointment, and they went for a stroll on Park Avenue, which was
the aristocratic street of American City and the scene of the
“Easter parade.” It was war time, and many of the houses had flags
out, and many of the men were in uniform, and all of the sermons
dealt with martial themes. Christ, it appeared, was risen
again to make the world safe for democracy, and to establish
self-determination for all people; and Peter and Miss Frisbie both
had on their best clothes, and watched the crowds in the “Easter
parade,” and Miss Frisbie studied the costumes and make-up of the
ladies, and picked up scraps of their conversation and whispered
them to Peter, and made Peter feel that he was back on Mount Olympus
again.

They turned into one of the swell Park Avenue churches; the Church
of the Divine Compassion it was called, and it was very “high,” with
candles and incense--althogh you could hardly smell the incense on
this occasion for the scent of the Easter lilies and the ladies.
Peter and his friend were escorted to one of the leather covered
pews, and they heard the Rev. de Willoughby Stotterbridge, a famous
pulpit orator, deliver one of those patriotic sermons which were
quoted in the “Times” almost every Monday morning. The Rev. de
Willoughby Stotterbridge quoted some Old Testament text about
exterminating the enemies of the Lord, and he sang the triumph of
American arms, and the overwhelming superiority of American
munitions. He denounced the Bolsheviks and all other traitors, and
called for their instant suppression; he didn’t say that he had
actually been among the crowd which had horse-whipped the I. W. Ws.
and smashed the printing presses and typewriters of the Socialists,
but he made it unmistakably clear that that was what he wanted, and
Peter’s bosom swelled with happy pride. It was something to a man to
know that he was serving his country and keeping the old flag
waving; but it was still more to know that he was enlisted in the
service of the Almighty, that Heaven and all its hosts were on his
side, and that everything he had done had the sanction of the
Almighty’s divinely ordained minister, speaking in the Almighty’s
holy temple, in the midst of stained-glass windows and brightly
burning candles and the ravishing odor of incense, and of Easter
lilies and of mignonette and lavender in the handkerchiefs of
delicately gowned and exquisite ladies from Mount Olympus. This, to
be sure, was mixing mythologies, but Peter’s education had been
neglected in his youth, and Peter could not be blamed for taking the
great ones of the earth as they were, and believing what they taught
him.

The white robed choir marched out, and the music of “Onward
Christian Soldiers” faded away, and Peter and his lady went out from
the Church of the Divine Compassion, and strolled on the avenue
again, and when they had sufficiently filled their nostrils with the
sweet odors of snobbery, they turned into the park, where there were
places of seclusion for young couples interested in each other. But
alas, the fates which dogged Peter in his love-making had prepared
an especially cruel prank that morning. At the entrance to the park,
whom should Peter meet but Comrade Schnitzelmann, a fat little
butcher who belonged to the “Bolshevik local” of American City.
Peter tried to look the other way and hurry by, but Comrade
Schnitzelmann would not have it so. He came rushing up with one
pudgy hand stretched out, and a beaming smile on his rosy Teutonic
countenance. “Ach, Comrade Gudge!” cried he. “Wie geht’s mit you dis
morning?”

“Very well, thank you,” said Peter, coldly, and tried to hurry on.

But Comrade Schnitzelmann held onto his hand. “So! You been seeing
dot Easter barade!” said he. “Vot you tink, hey? If we could get all
de wage slaves to come und see dot barade, we make dem all
Bolsheviks pretty quick! Hey, Comrade Gudge?”

“Yes, I guess so,” said Peter, still more coldly.

“We show dem vot de money goes for--hey, Comrade Gudge!” And Comrade
Schnitzelmann chuckled, and Peter said, quickly, “Well, good-bye,”
 and without introducing his lady-love took her by the arm and
hurried away.

But alas, the damage had been done! They walked for a minute or two
amid ominous silence. Then suddenly the manicurist stood still and
confronted Peter. “Mr. Gudge,” she demanded, “what does that mean?”

And Peter of course could not answer. He did not dare to meet her
flashing eyes, but stood digging the toe of his shoe into the path.
“I want to know what it means,” persisted the girl. “Are you one of
those Reds?”

And what could poor Peter say? How could he explain his acquaintance
with that Teutonic face and that Teutonic accent?

The girl stamped her foot with impatient anger. “So you’re one of
those Reds! You’re one of those pro-German traitors! You’re an
imposter, a spy!”

Peter was helpless with embarrassment and dismay. “Miss Frisbie,” he
began, “I can’t explain--”

“Why can’t you explain? Why can’t any honest man explain?”

“But--but--I’m not what you think--it isn’t true! I--I--” It was on
the tip of Peter’s tongue to say, “I’m a patriot! I’m a 100%
American, protecting my country against these traitors!” But
professional honor sealed his tongue, and the little manicurist
stamped her foot again, and her eyes flashed with indignation.

“You dare to seek my acquaintance! You dare to take me to church!
Why--if there was a policeman in sight, I’d report you, I’d send you
to jail!” And actually she looked around for a policeman! But it is
well known that there never is a policeman in sight when you look
for one; so Miss Frisbie stamped her foot again and snorted in
Peter’s face. “Goodbye, Comrade Gudge!” The emphasis she put upon
that word “comrade” would have frozen the fieriest Red soul; and she
turned with a swish of her skirts and strode off, and Peter stood
looking mournfully at her little French heels going crunch, crunch,
crunch on the gravel path. When the heels were clean gone out of
sight, Peter sought out the nearest bench and sat down and buried
his face in his hands, a picture of woe. Was there ever in the world
a man who had such persistent ill luck with women?




Section 71


These were days of world-agony, when people bought the newspapers
several times every day, and when crowds gathered in front of
bulletin boards, looking at the big maps with little flags, and
speculating, were the Germans going to get to Paris, were they going
to get to the Channel and put France out of the war? And then
suddenly the Americans struck their first blow, and hurled the
Germans back at Chateau-Thierry, and all America rose up with one
shout of triumph!

You would think that was a poor time for pacifist agitation; but the
members of the Anti-conscription League had so little discretion
that they chose this precise moment to publish a pamphlet,
describing the torturing of conscientious objectors in military
prisons and training camps! Peter had been active in this
organization from the beginning, and he had helped to write into the
pamphlet a certain crucial phrase which McGivney had suggested. So
now here were the pamphlets seized by the Federal government, and
all the members of the Anti-conscription League under arrest,
including Sadie Todd and little Ada Ruth and Donald Gordon! Peter
was sorry about Sadie Todd, in spite of the fact that she had called
him names. He couldn’t be very sorry about Ada Ruth, because she was
obviously a fanatic, bent on getting herself into trouble. As for
Donald Gordon, if he hadn’t learned his lesson from that whipping,
he surely had nobody to blame but himself.

Peter was a member of this Anti-conscription League, so he pretended
to be in hiding, and carried on a little comedy with Ada Ruth’s
cousin, an Englishwoman, who hid him out in her place in the
country. Peter had an uncomfortable quarter of an hour when Donald
Gordon was released on bail, because the Quaker boy insisted that
the crucial phrase which had got them all into trouble had been
stricken out of the manuscript before he handed it to Peter Gudge to
take to the printer. But Peter insisted that Donald was mistaken,
and apparently he succeeded in satisfying the others, and after they
were all out on bail, he made bold to come out of his hiding place
and to attend one or two protest meetings in private homes.

Then began a new adventure, in some ways the most startling of all.
It had to do with another girl, and the beginning was in the home of
Ada Ruth, where a few of the most uncompromising of the pacifists
gathered to discuss the question of raising money to pay for their
legal defense. To this meeting came Miriam Yankovich, pale from an
operation for cancer of the breast, but with a heart and mind as Red
as ever. Miriam had brought along a friend to help her, because she
wasn’t strong enough to walk; and it was this friend who started
Peter on his new adventure.

Rosie Stern was her name, and she was a solid little Jewish working
girl, with bold black eyes, and a mass of shining black hair, and
flaming cheeks and a flashing smile. She was dressed as if she knew
about her beauty, and really appreciated it; so Peter wasn’t
surprised when Miriam, introducing her, remarked that Rosie wasn’t a
Red and didn’t like the Reds, but had just come to help her, and to
