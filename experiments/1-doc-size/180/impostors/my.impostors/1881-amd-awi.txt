 



CHAPTEB XIX. 

nr DIM BBMBMBRAHCB. 

DoLLT has several letters the next momiiig ; one from 
St. Greorge, one from Helen, who asks her to go over to 
the cottage snd attend to several trifling commissions for 
Mr. Stannard's comfort, and one that she saves for the 
privacy of her own room. Miss Ormiston offers to drive 
her over ; but she hesitates oddly, and promises an answer 
by and by. The result is that she would, prefer going in 
the afternoon. She will devote the morning to rest. 
. Christmas has several engagements on her hands, and 
her stay at the mill is brief. There are two committees 
for the consideration of those incapables that abound in 
every town and society. At one of them she meets Mrs. 
Donaldson. 

That lady has never cordially forgiven Christmas for 
being instrumental in the success of Ormiston Mills. She 
had felt so certain of the contrary, and had besought her 
cousin to keep his proffered position ready for an emer- 
gency, but it did not occur. She, was not tired of Carn- 
ley ; indeed, she had attained to an enviable position 
socially. Still, Miss Ormiston had become a sort of thorn 
to her, in that she found her changing the beliefs of the 
two men whom she had largely idealized. She could not 
endure that her husband should admire a woman who set 
at naught some of the conventionalities that were not only 
social laws to her, but the very foundation-stones of the 
well-being of society. And that Christmas should have it 
in her power to soften Leighton St. George's prejudices, 
was extremely annoying. The fact, too, that it was not 
her convincing arguments that held St. George from a 



 



 



warmer regard, but an entanglement almoBt as reprehen- 
sible as that with a business woman. 

Even here they are unconscious rivals. Miss Ormiston 
goes frankly to a point, without any of those delicate side- 
approaches most women are so fond of, the small argu- 
ments that seem to air one's knowledge of a subject. She 
is not bold or agressive, but she does sway people by 
her irresistible truth and sense of power. Fortunately, 
Philip's partial verdict cannot influence a wide circle, since 
he never praises Miss Ormiston in public, but it vexes 
her that other people yield, without having his excuse. 
Even to the Cliff House denizens. Miss Ormiston is quite 
an object of human interest and perhaps envy. 

It seems to Christmas that she has been rather remiss 
in social duty here. It might be interesting for Mrs. 
Donaldson to meet Miss Allaire; as soon as Mr. St. 
Greorge returns she will give a little dinner and some 
sort of evening entertainment for them. She and Dolly 
have been going a good deal, and it is time there was 
some return of hospitality. 

So she broaches it to Dolly at luncheon. The girl 
looks pallid and depressed, but she brightens up wonder- 
fully and enters into the plan with a zest that surprises 
her friend. 

" Give a party for me," cries Dolly, " a lovely evening 
lawn party. Let me see â€” there is a new moon, I saw it 
through glass and over my left shoulder, and of course I 
am prepared for all kinds of bad luck: that's why I 
have been so down-hearted " ; and she laughs childishly. 
" In about ten days more it will be full, and Helen will be 
settled. Yes, let us have one grand time ! " 

Dolly's spirits seem to rise unwontedly. She gets 
ready for her drive, and they are soon bowling along the 
smooth road, while she chatters nonsense and laughs in a 
thin, strained tone, in which there is no Joyousness. 
Christmas cannot understand it. 



 



 



 

The maid at the cottage receives her orders with quiet 
acceptance. They call upon Mrs. Brundage, and Dolly 
apologizes profusely for the wretched headache of the 
other day, when she missed her and Mr. Jeffries. 

" I warned him that there was a possibility of trespass- 
ing,' says Mrs. Brundage laughingly, " and he wondered 
how any man could charm you so deeply as to induce you 
to give up your freedom. And I had no idea Mr. St. 
George was so great a genius ! It seems this Mr. Val- 
iiant has been buying some of the finest pictures of great 
artists abroad, and itia & high compliment to be placed 
with them." 

" I don't know," says Dolly with a sort of childish con- 
trariness. " There is no need of his selling pictures, and 
so I wrote to him." 

Mrs. Brundage stares a little, and then the quick flush 
in Miss Ormiston's face attracts her. Here is apprecia- 
tion, surely. 

'' But think of the fame ! " 

Dolly shrugs her shoulders. 

Two or three ladies come in, but Mr. Jefflies does not 
make his appearance. They have missed the two from 
their evening festivities ; has Miss Allaire been ill? Was 
the evening of the play too great a tax? 

Mrs. Brundage smiles odcQy. Is Dolly Allaire really in 
love with St. George? How will she take it if her 
olden knight transfers his fancy to Miss Ormiston? 
As she remembers, Dolly had a perfect passion for 
jealousy, and allowed her admirers very little latitude. 
It is quite evident Mr. Jeffries has outgrown his pen- 
chant. 

The next incident is the return of the Stannards and 
St. G-eorge, who has been persuaded to transfer his room 
to tlieir cottage, where indeed there is a pleasant apart- 
ment quite at his service, since for all culinary purposes 
they depend upon the services of Cliff House, and can go 



 



 





to tiieir meals or have them sent. Christmas is shocked 
at the change in Mr. Stannard. He does look ill and 
wasted, and so nearly resembles his mother that she can 
quite see in his, the old fastidious face foreshadowed. 
They were all delicate looking, she remembers, and yet 
Mrs. Stannard lived to reasonable old age. 

Mrs. Stannard has sent from the city some of her lux- 
urious adornments, and the cottage becomes the centre of 
attraction and approval. It is an admirable and suggest- 
ive background for herself, it has the rarefied atmosphere 
of elegance and cultivation, and she adorns it as a queen 
playing at simplicity. Thither some of the choicest find 
their way. It is too small for dancing or crowds of any 
kind, and the three fill it with the personality of a group 
of fine statuary. Like a revelation it comes to Christmas 
Ormiston that such surroundings are Leighton St. George's 
true portion, that art and culture are his birthright ; not 
the superficial vanities of society, perhaps not that 
plainer gift of sympathy, with a lower round of humanity.
