much to the cheerful temper and hopeful spirit of 
his wite. So far from murmuring at the change in 
their prospects, or permitting her husband to mur- 
mur, every allusion to this change was accompa- 
nied by Mrs. Hartley with expressions of thankful- 
ness that all the real blessings the world had to 
give were left them. 

'' We have more than enough for all our wants," 
she would say — " And besides, we have each other, 
and our dear little Marien. Do you think we have 
reason to complain ? No — you cannot. Our cup 
is not empty — it is full to the brim." 

As was ever the case, a smile of welcome greeted 
Hartley on entering his pleasant home. But it 
seemed to him, after the smile had died away, that 
there was a thoughtful expression upon Anna's brow. 
This grew distinct to his eye, as he observed her 
face more carefully. 

" Is Marien asleep ?" he asked, soon after he 
came in. 

'' Yes. She was tired, and went to sleep early. 
I tried to keep her awake until you came home, 
but she was so drowsy and fretful, that I thought 
it best to put her to bed." 

"Dear little creature!" 

"She is a sweet child." 


" A sweeter one cannot be found. As she grows 
older, how much delight we shall take in seeing 
her mind expand, and become filled with images 
of all that is lovely and innocent. As the twig is 
bent, so is the tree inclined. Anna, all we have to 
do is to bend this twig aright. Heaven's rain and 
sunshine will do the rest." 

" To bend it aright may not be so easy a task as 
you suppose, James," 

" Perhaps not. And yet it seems to me, that a 
wise course of government, carefully pursued, must 
produce the desired result." 

" To determine wisely is not always in our 
power. Ah, James ' It is that thing of determining 
wisely that gives me the greatest concern. I be- 
lieve that I could faithfully carry out any system 
of government, were I only well satisfied of its 
being the true one. But, so conscious am I, that, 
if in the system I adopt there be a vital error, the 
effect will be lastingly injurious to our child, that 
I hesitate and tremble at every step. The twig 
that shoots forth, unwarped by nature, pliant and 
graceful, may be trained to grow in almost any 
direction. But our child is born with an evil and 
perverse will — a will thoroughly depraved." 

" That Ido not like to admit ; and yet I believe 
it to be too true." 



 

" Alas ! it is but too true, James. It needs not 
Revelation to tell us this. Already the moral de- 
formity we have entailed upon our child, is show- 
ing itself every day. — How shall we correct it.' — 
How shall we change it into beauty ? I think of this 
almost every hour, and sometimes it makes me feA 
sad. It is easy to say — ' Just as the twig is bent the 
tree's inclined' — but it is not so easy a thing to bend 
the human twig as you will. There is great danger 
of creaiing one deformity in the effort to correct 
another; or of checking, in its flow, the healthy 
sap by undue pressure. And still further; our 
own states of m.ind, from various causes, are ever 
changing, and from these changes result obscurity, 
or a new direction of our thoughts. What seems 
of the first moment to-day, is not so considered to- 
morrow, because other ideas are more distinctly 
before our minds and throw things of equal im- 
portance into obscurity. Our own uncorrected 
hereditary evils are also in our way, and hinder us 
from either seeing aright or doing aright." 

''You are disposed to look at the gloomy side 
of the picture, Anna," replied her husband, smilincr. 
'' Suppose you take a more encouraging view." 

" Show me the bright side, James. I will look 
at it with pleasure." 

'' There is a bright side, Anna — every thing has 



 

a sunny side ; but I do not know that it is in my 
power to show you the sunny side of this picture. 
I will, however, present to your mind a truth that 
may suggest many others of an encouraging nature. 
Into right ends there flows a perception of true 
means. Do you not believe this ?" 

" I have the best of reasons for believing it to be 
true." 

"Can there be a higher or holier end than a 
mother's, when she proposes to herself the good 
of her child ?" 

" J believe not." 

" Into that end will there most assuredly be an 
influx of wisdom to discover the true means. Do 
not despond, then. As your day is, so will your 
strength be." 

Anna sighed heavily, but made no reply for some 
moments. She was too deeply conscious of her 
ignorance of the true means, to feel a profound 
confidence in the practical bearing of the principles 
that her husband had declared, and which reason 
told her were true. 

" It is easy to theorize," she at length said. " It 
is pleasant to the mind to dwell upon true princi- 
ples, and see how they apply in real life. But, it 
is a different matter when we come to bring down 
these theories ourselves. There is in us so much 
that hinders. — Self love, indolence, pride, and a 
thousand other things, come between our good 
purposes and their accomplishment." 

'' True. But, on the side of good resolutions, is 
One who is all " 

"Right, ray dear husband! — Right!" exclaimed 
Anna, interrupting him. " He that is for us is 
more than all who are against us. If I can only 
fix my confidence, like an anchor to the soul, upon 
Him, all the rough places of peevish nature will be 
made even — light will break in from a dark sky 
—I shall see clearly to walk in right paths." 

" Ever let us both strive to fix our confidence 
upon God," responded Hartley in a low but ear- 
nest voice. " If we do so, we shall not find our 
duty so hard to perform as at first sight it may ap- 
pear to us. Angels love infants and children most 
tenderly, and they will be our teachers if we keep 
our minds elevated above all mere worldly and 
selfish ends, and seek only the highest good for 
our offspring." 

"The highest good, — Yes, that must be our aim. 
But do we agree as to what is the highest good ?" 

" An important question, Anna. If we do not 
agree, our task will be a difficult one. What do 
you call the highest good ." 

Anna mused for some time. 





"The highest good — the highest good — " she \ 
murmured abstractedly. " Is it wealth ? — Honour ? 
The love and praise of men ? — The attainment of 
all earthly blessings ? — No — no. — Tliese can only
