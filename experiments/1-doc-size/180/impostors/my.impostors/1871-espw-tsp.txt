created her a bluefisher ; in Paris she would make 
muslin flowers, and learn the mMer to-morrow. 

This was piquant in her; her plighted hus- 
band found himself entertained by it always ; 
he folded her two hands like sheets of rice- 
paper over his own, with an easy smile. 

The weather occurred to the young lady 
about six o'clock in the form of a query : Was 
it worth while to go out to-night .' She cultivated 
an objection to Don Giovanni in the rain, 
— and it always rained on Giovanni; Maverick 
could talk Brignoli to Mrs. Silver, and hold a 
fan for Fly, as well without her ; she happened 
to find herself more interested in an arm-chair 
than in anything else in the world, and slippers 
were the solution of the problem of life. Was 
it worth while .' 

This was one of those vital questions which 
require immediate motives for a settlement, and 
of immediate motives Miss Kelso possessed very 
few. Indeed, it was as yet unanswered in her 
own mind, when the silver handle of her carriage- 
door had shut with a little shine like a smile 

upon her, and Fly's voice, like boiling candy, 
bubbled at her from the front seat. 

Maverick had called ; there had been a whiff 
of pleasant viet air in her face ; and, after all, life 
and patent springs are much alike in doors or out. 

Miss Kelso sank languidly back into the 
perfumed cushions ; the close doors and windows 
shut in their thick sweetness ; the broken lights 
of the street dropped in, and Maverick sat 
beside her. 

" You have had your carriage re-scented, 
Perley, I 'm sure," said Fly, who was just 
enough at home with Perley to say it. 

" From Harris's, — yes.'' 

" Santalina, unless I am quite mistaken ? " 

This, softly, from Mrs. Silver ; Mrs. Silver 
was apt to speak very' softly. 

" I was tired to death of heliotrope," said 
Perley, with a weary motion of her well-shaped 
head ; " it clings so. There was some trouble, 
I believe, to take it out ; new stuffing and 
covering. But I think it pays." 

" Indeed, yes, richly." 

" It always pays to take trouble for sachet, I 
think," said Fly, sententiously. 


" Perley never makes a mistake in a perfume," 
— that came, of course, from Maverick. 

"Perley never did make a mistake in a 
perfume," observed Mrs. Silver, in the mild mother- 
ly manner which she had acquired from 
frequently matronizing Perley. " Never from the 
day Burt made the blunder of tuberoses for 
her poor mother. The child flung them out 
of the casket herself. She was six years old 
the day before. It was a gratification to me 
when Burt went out of fashion." 

Perley, it may be presumed, feeling always 
some awkwardness at the mention of a dead 
parent for whom propriety required her to 
mourn, and in connection with whose faint 
memory she could not, do the best she might, acquire 
an unhappiness, made no reply, and sachet and 
Mrs. Silver dropped into silence together. Fly 
broke it, in her ready way : " So kind in you 
to send for us, Perley ! " 

"It was quite proper," said Perley. 

She did not think of anything else to say, 
and fell, as her santalina and her chaperone 
had fallen, a little noticeably out of the 
conversation. 

Fly and Maverick Hayle did the talking. Mrs. 
Silver dropped in now and then properly. 

Perley listened lazily to the three voices ; one 
sometimes hears very noticeable voices from very 
unnoticeable people ; these were distinct of note 
as a triplet ; idle, soft, and sweet — sweetly, softly 
idle. She played accompaniments with them to 
her amused fancy. 

The triplet rounded into a chord presently, and 
made her a little sleepy. Sensitive only to an 
occasional flat or sharp of Brignoli or Kellogg, 
she fell with half-closed eyes into the luxury of 
her own thoughts. 

What were they .' What does any young lady 
think about on her way to the opera ? One 
would like to know. A young lady, for instance, 
who is used to her gloves, and indifferent to her 
stone cameos ; who has the score by heart, and 
is tired of the prima donna; who has had a 
season ticket every winter since she can 
remember, and will have one every winter till 
she dies ? 

The ride to the theatre was not a short one, 
and slow that night on account of the storm, 
which was thickening a little, half snow. 


Perley, through the white curtains of her falling 
eyelids, looked out at it ; she was fond of 
watching the streets when no one was watching 
her, especially on stormy nights, for no 
reason in particular that she knew of, except that 
she felt so dry and comfortable. So clean too ! 
There were a great many muddy people out that 
night ; the sleet did not wash them as fast as the 
mud spattered them ; and the wind at the corners 
sprang on them sharply. From her carriage 
window she could look on and see it lying in 
wait for them, and see it crouch and bound and 
set teeth on them. She really followed with 
some interest, having nothing better to do, the 
manful struggles of a girl in a plaid dress, who 
battled with the gusts about a carriage-length 
ahead of her, for perhaps half a dozen blocks. 
This girl struck out with her hands as a boxer 
would ; sometimes she pommelled with her 
elbows and knees like a desperate prize-fighter ; 
she was rather small, but she kept her balance ; 
when her straw hat blew off, she chased head- 
long after it, and Perley languidly smiled. She 
was apt to be amused by the world outside of 
her carriage. It conceived such original ways 


of holding its hands, and wearing its hats, and 
carrying its bundles. It had such a taste in 
colors, such disregard of clean linen, and was 
always in such a hurry. This last especially 
interested her; Miss Kelso had never been in 
a hurry in her life. 

"There!" said Fly. 

" Where ? " said Perley, starting. 

" I 've broken my fan ; made a perfect wreck 
of it ! What shall I do ? No, thank you. 
Mr. Hayle, I am in blue to-night. You know 
you couldn't fail to get me a green one if you 
tried. You must bring me out — but it 's too 
wet to bring fans out. Mother, we must go in 
ourselves." 

So it came about that in the land of fans, or in 
the region roundabout, Maverick and the Silvers 
disappeared in the flash of a fancy-store, and 
Perley, in the carriage, was left alone. 

" Dear me ! " said Mrs. Silver, placidly, as the 
umbrella extinguished her, " we are making our 
friends a great deal of trouble. Fly, for a little 
thing.''
