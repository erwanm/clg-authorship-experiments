The driver of the last ambulance seemed 
to be ill; his head lay on the shoulder of a 
Sister of Charity who had taken the steering 
wheel. . 

The gendarme beside Maryette signalled 
her to stop; then he got out of the market 
cart and, lifting the body of the American 
muleteer in his powerful arms, strode across 
the road. The airman leaped from the mar 
ket cart and followed him. 

Between them they drew out a stretcher, 
laid the muleteer on it, and shoved it back 
into the vehicle. 

There was a brief consultation, then they 
both came back to Maryette, who, rigid in her 
seat and very pale, sat watching the pro 
cedure in silence. 

The gendarme said: 

"I go to Fontanes. There's a dressing sta 
tion on the road. It appears that your young 
man's heart hasn't quite stopped yet 

The girl rose excitedly to her feet, but the 
gendarme gently forced her back into her seat 
and laid the reins in her hands. To the air 
man he growled: 





 



"I did not tell this poor child to hope; I 
merely informed her that her friend yonder 
is still breathing. But he's as full of holes 
as a pepper pot!" He frowned at Maryette: 
" Allans! My comrade here goes to Sainte 
Lesse. Drive him there now, in God's name, 
before the Uhlans come clattering on your 
heels !" 

He turned, strode away to the ambulance 
once more, climbed in, and placed one big arm 
around the sick driver's shoulder, drawing the 
man's head down against his breast. 

"Bonne chance!" he called back to the air 
man, who had now seated himself beside 
Maryette. "Explain to our little bell-mistress 
that we're taking her friend to a place where 
they fool Death every day where to cheat 
the grave is a flourishing business! Good 
bye! Courage! En route, brave Sister of the 
World !" 

The Sister of Charity turned and smiled at 
Maryette, made her a friendly gesture, threw 
in the clutch, and, twisting the steering wheel 
with both sun-browned hands, guided the machine out onto the road and sped away swiftly 
after the cloud of receding dust. 

"Drive on, mademoiselle," said the airman 
quietly. 

In his accent there was something poign 
antly familiar to Maryette, and she turned 
with a start and looked at him out of her 
dark blue, tear-marred eyes. 

"Are you also American?" she asked. 

"Gunner observer, American air squadron, 
mademoiselle." 

"An airman?" 

"Yes. My machine was shot down in Ni- 
velle woods an hour ago." 

After a silence, as they jogged along be 
tween the hazel thickets in the warm after 
noon sunshine: 

"Were you acquainted with my friend?" 
she asked wistfully. 

"With Jack Burley? A little. I knew him 
in Calais." 

The tears welled up into her eyes: 

"Could you tell me about him? . . . He was 
my first friend. ... I did not understand him 
in the beginning, monsieur. Among children 





 



it is different; I had known boys as one 
knows them at school. But a man, never 
and, indeed, I had not thought I had grown 
up until he came Djack to live at our inn. 
. . . The White Doe at Sainte Lesse, mon 
sieur. My father keeps it." 

"I see," nodded the airman gravely. 

"Yes that is the way. He came my first 
friend, Djack with mules from America, mon 
sieur one thousand mules. And God knows 
Sainte Lesse had never seen the like! As for 
me I thought I was a child still until do 
you understand, monsieur?" 

"Yes, Maryette." 

"Yes, that is how I found I was grown up. 
He was a man, not a boy that is how I found 
out. So he became my first friend. He was 
quite droll, and very big and kind and timid 
following me about oh, it was quite droll 
for both of us, because at first I was afraid, 
but pretended not to be." 

She smiled, then suddenly her eyes filled 
with the tragedy again, and she began to 
whimper softly to herself, with a faint sound 
like a hovering pigeon. 









"Tell me about him," said the airman. 

She staunched her tears with the edge of 
her apron. 

"It was that way with us," she managed to 
say. "I was enchanted and a little frightened 
it being my first friendship. He was so big, 
so droll, so kind. . . . We were on our way 
to Nivelle this morning. I was to play the 
carillon being mistress of the bells at Sainte 
Lesse and there was nobody else to play the 
bells at Nivelle; and the wounded desired to 
hear the carillon." 

"Yes." 

"So Djack came after me hearing rumours 
of Prussians in that direction. They were 
true oh, God! and the Prussians caught us 
there where you found us." 

She bowed her supple figure double on the 
seat, covering her face with her sun-browned
