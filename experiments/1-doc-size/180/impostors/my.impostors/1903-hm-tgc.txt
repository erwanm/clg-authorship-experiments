pommel of his sword.

"Monsieur le Marquis has wronged you?" asked the priest, a fire leaping
into his eyes.

"It is a private affair, Monsieur," coldly.

"Pardon me!"  Brother Jacques made a gesture of humility.  He rolled
the bread crumbs into a ball which he dropped into the bowl.  Presently
he pushed aside the bowl and rose, his long black cassock falling to
his ankles.  He drew his rosary through his belt and put on his
shovel-shaped hat.

Again the Chevalier's attention was drawn toward the mutilated hand.

"The pastimes of savages, Monsieur," Brother Jacques said grimly,
holding out his hand for inspection: "the torture of the pipe, which I
stood but poorly.  Well, my brother, I am outward bound, and Rouen is
far away.  The night is beautiful, for the wind will drive away the
snow-clouds and the stars will shine brightly.  Peace be with you."

"I wish you well, Monsieur," returned the Chevalier politely.

Then Brother Jacques left the Candlestick, mounted his mule, and rode
away, caring as little as the Chevalier whether or not their paths
should cross again.

"Monsieur le Marquis!" murmured the Chevalier, staring at the empty
bowl.  "So the marquis, my father, gives to the Church?  That is droll.
Now, why does the marquis give to the Church?  He has me there.  Bah!
and this priest's eyes.  Ah!" as he saw Madame Boisjoli returning,
followed by Charlot who carried the smoking supper; "here is something
that promises well."

"Brother Jacques is gone?" said madame, her eyes roving.

"Yes."  The Chevalier sat down at a table.

"Monsieur Paul?" timidly.

"Well, Mignon?" smiling.  Mignon was certainly good to look at.

"Did you notice Brother Jacques's eyes?"

"Do you mean to say that you, too, observed them?" with a shade of
annoyance.  Vanity compelled him to resent this absurd likeness.

"Immediately.  It was so strange.  And what a handsome priest!" slyly.

"Shall I call him back, Mignon?" laughing.

Madame exhibited a rounded shoulder.

"Bah with them all, Mignon, priests, cardinals, and journeys."  And
half an hour later, having demolished all madame had set before him,
besides sharing the excellent chambertin, the Chevalier felt the man
made whole again.  The warmth of the wine turned the edge of his
sterner thoughts; and at ten minutes to eight he went forth, a brave
and gallant man, handsome and gaily attired, his eyes glowing with
anticipating love, blissfully unconscious of the extraordinary things
which were to fall to his lot from this night onward.

The distance from the Candlestick was too short for the need of a
horse, so the Chevalier walked, lightly humming an old chanson of the
reign of Louis XIII, among whose royal pastimes was that of shaving his
courtiers:

  "Alas, my poor barber,
  What is it makes you sad?"
  "It is the grand king Louis,
  Thirteenth of that name."

He swung into the Rue Dauphin and mounted the Pont Neuf, glancing idly
below at the ferrymen whose torches threw on the black bosom of the
Seine long wavering threads of phantom fire.  The snow-clouds had
passed over, and the stars were shining; the wind was falling.  The
quays were white; the Louvre seemed but a vast pile of ghostly stones.
The hands of the clock in the quaint water-tower La Samaritaine pointed
at five to eight.  Oddly enough there came to the Chevalier a
transitory picture of a young Jesuit priest, winding through the bleak
hills on the way to Rouen.  The glories of the world, the love of
women?  What romance lay smoldering beneath that black cassock?  What
secret grief?  What sin?  Brother Jacques?  The name signified nothing.
Like all courtiers of his time, the Chevalier entertained the belief
that when a handsome youth took the orders it was in the effort to bury
some grief rather than to assist in the alleviation of the sorrows of
mankind.

He walked on, skirting the Louvre and presently entering the courtyard
of the Palais Royal.  The number of flambeaux, carriages and calèches
indicated to him that Mazarin was giving a party.  He lifted his cloak
from his shoulders, shook it, and threw it over his arm, and ascended
the broad staircase, his heart beating swiftly.  Would he see her?
Would she be in the gallery?  Would this night dispel the mystery?  At
the first landing he ran almost into Captain de Guitaut, who was
descending.

"Cévennes?" cried the captain, frankly astounded.

"And freshly from Rome, my Captain.  His Eminence is giving a party?"

"Are you weary of life, Monsieur?" asked the captain.  "What are you
doing here?  I had supposed you to be a man of sense, and on the way to
Spain.  And my word of honor, you stick your head down the lion's
mouth!  Follow your nose, follow your nose; it is none of my affair."
And the gruff old captain passed on down the stairs.

The Chevalier stared after him in bewilderment.  Spain? . . .  Weary of
life?  What had happened?

"Monsieur du Cévennes?" cried a thin voice at his elbow.

The Chevalier turned and beheld Bernouin, the cardinal's valet.

"Ah!" said the Chevalier.  Here was a man to explain the captain's
riddle.  "Will you announce to his Eminence that I have returned from
Rome, and also explain why you are looking at me with such bulging
eyes?  Am I a ghost?"  The Chevalier, being rich, was one of the few
who were never overawed by the grandeur of Mazarin's valet.  "What is
the matter?"

"Matter?" repeated the valet.  "Matter?  Nothing, Monsieur, nothing!"
quickly.  "I will this instant announce your return to monseigneur."

"One would think that I had been trying to run away," mused the
Chevalier, following the valet.


Meanwhile a lackey dressed in no particular livery entered the Hôtel of
the Silver Candlestick and inquired for Monsieur Breton, lackey to
Monsieur le Chevalier du Cévennes.  He was directed to the floor above.
On hearing a knock, Breton hastily closed the book he was reading and
went to the door.  The hallway was so dark that he could distinguish no
feature of his caller.

"Monsieur Breton?" the strange lackey inquired,

"Are you seeking me?" Breton asked diplomatically.

"I was directed to deliver this to you.  It is for your master," and
the stranger placed a bundle in Breton's hands.  Immediately he turned
and disappeared down the stairs.  Evidently he desired not to be
questioned.

Breton surveyed the bundle doubtfully, turned it this way and that.  On
opening it he was greatly surprised to find his master's celebrated
grey cloak.  He examined it.  It was soiled and rent in several places.
Breton hung it up in the closet, shaking his head.

"This is very irregular," he muttered.  "Monsieur de Saumaise would
never have returned it in this condition; besides, Hector would have
been the messenger.  What will Monsieur Paul say when he sees it?"

And, knowing that he had no cause to worry, and having not the
slightest warning that his master's liberty was in danger, Breton
reseated himself by the candles and continued his indulgence in stolen
sweets; that is to say, he renewed the adventures of that remarkable
offspring of Gargantua.




CHAPTER IV

AN AENEAS FOR AN ACHATES

In the grand gallery of the Palais Royal stood a mahogany table, the
bellying legs of which, decorated with Venetian-wrought gold, sparkled
and glittered in the light of the flames that rose and fell in the
gaping chimney-place.  Around this table were seated four persons of
note: the aging Maréchal de Villeroi, Madame de Motteville of
imperishable memoirs, Anne of Austria, and Cardinal Mazarin.  The
Italian, having won a pile of golden louis from the soldier, was
smiling amiably and building yellow pyramids, forgetful for the time
being of his gouty foot which dozed on a cushion under the table.  This
astute politician was still a handsome man, but the Fronde and the
turbulent nobility had left their imprint.  There were many lines
wrinkling the circle of his eyes, and the brilliant color on his cheeks
was the effect of rouge and fever.
