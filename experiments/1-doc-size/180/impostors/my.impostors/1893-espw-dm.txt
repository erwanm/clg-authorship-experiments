" There ! " said Trouncey O Grian to the 
reviving negro, whom the boys were fanning 
and unfastening and helping to his feet. 
" He won't sarse you again to-night. This 
is a free college and a free country. Come 
and look at him, if you want to. He 'll have 
a headache for a week or two, I take it. 
Don't be scared, boys. He isn't hurt. You 
don't suppose I'd be such a flat as that." 

But the rush broke up now in confusion. 
Calhoun was insensible ; the colored student 
bleeding ; the tutors on the spot ; the police 
coming ; Trouncey O Grian suspended ; 
Calhoun marked ; and generally there was the 
mischief to pay. 

Don Marcy went to his room that night a 
little gloomily. Jamie Fleet was there, hard 
at his Antigone for to-morrow. 

" Hi, Don ! " he said cordially. " How'd 
the rush go off ? I didn't stay. I've got an 
extra job on to-night. And it took you so 
long to get at it. Have a good time ? " 

" Got forty marks," answered Don so 
berly. " Ten more will expel me. I shall 
have to get up to prayers all the rest of the 
term. Counted on those forty to sleep over. 



 

It was no kind of a rush, anyhow. Didn't 
get the cane. Nobody got the cane. Tutor 
got the cane. Jerry McCarty arrested the 
cane. Two fellows busted. Faculty there. I 
lost my smoking-cap, too. Got my clothes 
torn off of me see ! clear down to the 
waist. I came home in a coat of Trouncey s. 
I sprained my shoulder somehow. Somebody 
squashed my toes. It was the greatest tom 
fool of a rush, anyhow." 

" Didn't pay, did it ? " asked Jamie sym 
pathetically. 

" Where 's the Greek lesson ? " growled 
Don. He sat down very hard and looked it 
over. He presented anything but a scholarly 
appearance ; his handsome face was pounded 
and bleeding, his flannel shirt in strips, and 
Trouncey 's big coat fastened across his
shoulders by the sleeves. " They 'll flunk me, sure 
pop," he said disconsolately. " I haven't 
learned a Greek for two weeks, I've been so 
busy. Well, anyway, I've got to go and get 
a bath, now" 

Lee Calhoun, while he was recovering 
from the effects of Trouncey O Grian 's blow, 
employed his time in writing home the most 
dismal letters that had visited his ancestral 
halls since Lee came to college. The result 



 

of the most explicit was a communication 
from his father to the President of Harle, 
which ran as follows : 

PRESIDENT OF HARLE UNIVERSITY Sir : 
My son complains to me that he is required to sit 
by the side of a negro student. I am compelled 
to make it a personal request that his seat be 
changed. Respectfully, 

C. C. CALHOUN. 

To this letter the President sent, by return 
mail, the following reply : 

C. C. CALHOUN, ESQ. Dear Sir : I am 
happy to be able to inform you that your cause of 
complaint in the case of your son will be entirely 
removed at the close of this term. Hitherto, we 
have seated the students alphabetically in the 
recitation-room ; hereafter, they will be seated 
according to scholarship. 

I am, sir, respectfully, 

A. B. BAXTER, 
President of Harle University. 



CHAPTER III. 

HAZING. 

WHEN Don Marcy was* a Freshman at 
Harle, he took his turn at a slight acquaint 
ance with the ancient and fortunately now 
unfashionable practice of hazing which had 
such a mysterious relation to the culture of 
a liberal education, as imbibed by the mas 
culine race. Marcy 's experience was in this 
wise : 

Nobody had handled him, or threatened to, 
till the first term was nearly over. He was 
such a good-natured, sensible lad, mannered 
with the modesty of real good breeding, and 
he had the lack of ostentation which accom 
panies plenty of money when one is born to 
it, or, at least, well-born to it, he had 
such merry eyes, and treated everybody so 
decently ; and was clever at recitation when 
he chose to trouble himself, and never swag 
gered or swelled, and was such a plucky fel 
low in particular, that it had been hard to 
make out a case against him. At last, however, 
a Sophomore raised the objection that 
he was too well dressed, and took a Professor 's 
daughter to drive. This accusation carried 
the class, and a delegation of a dozen Sopho 
mores waited upon Marcy one pleasant even 
ing with vengeance in their eyes. 

Donald was alone ; he had no chum just 
then ; he was studying in his comfortable 
room, the most tastefully fitted of any in 
the college. It was not a showy room, but 
refinedly elegant, from the damask drapery 
curtains on his study windows and the brass 
fender and fire-set at the fireplace, to the 
little Persian rug that lay before the toilet- 
table in his chamber. Don was a fellow of 
delicate personal habits, and kept that room 
as neat as any lady might have done. He 
enjoyed it amazingly, and it had never 
occurred to him, by the way, that two views 
could be taken of the subject, till Jamie 
Fleet 's father came in one day with Don 's 
own parental visitor they had been class 
mates, and had forgotten each other, and 
met again and remembered at Harle, where 
their two sons entered college together to 
see the boy 's room. 

Dr. Fleet was a poor man, a country minister.
He had the same gentle, attractive 



 

eyes that Jamie had: he wrote for the 
reviews from his rural parish, and was not 
unknown in the great world where the elder 
Mr. Marcy lived upon his income, and 
frequented what is called " society." 

" There, Fleet, what do you think of it ? " 
asked the other father fondly. " Isn't this 
a pretty good thing in the way of a boy 's 
room ? I've tried to make Don comfortable. 
He 's used to it, you know." 

" Sir," answered his old classmate, smil 
ing, and rubbing the toe of his patched boot 
over the pattern of the heavy Axminster on 
which they stood, " if you really want to 
know what I think of it, I 'll tell you. You'll 
never raise a scholar on that carpet"
