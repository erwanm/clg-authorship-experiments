ready, with indisputable proof. 

" Mother," said he, "wears a bonnet — and gloves." 

Mrs. Ramsay seemed to collapse visibly in the bed, and 
stared at her little boy, not to put him out of countenance, 
but with a sincere desire to comprehend him. She had begun 



 





to wonder about her children, how they were doing without 
the wise brooding she made no doubt she gave them. Hav- 
ing summoned them, she had seen them, in candid anticipa- 
tion, flocking to her breast. But here was a set-faced little 
boy, hands clenched across his rotundity under the dirty 
tier, and he abjured her. Mrs. Ramsay had never felt so 
small, not when a statesman, in open meeting, challenged 
her statistics. 

Tonty was mortified. She felt partly the hostess of the 
meeting and partly the mother of the three piebald waifs, 
half-clean half-dirty, like illustrations of the origin of evil. 
It was her part to offer some gracious consolation to the 
repulsed lady, the while her good little right hand itched to 
lay upon Tony the smacking he deserved. 

" Shall you come home soon, mother? " she inquired, with 
a sweet precision, and Mrs. Ramsay replied that she should 
come as soon as she stopped remembering her cerebellum. 
And here Bess, judging the interval by the amount of work 
she had done in absence, considered it time to remove the 
guests, and swept them all downstairs before her, almost 
tumbling over one another now in their eagerness to escape, 
and out to their arboreal banquet, where even Tonty, released 
from the spell of the attractive but exacting lady called 
mother, chorussed with the rest. 

While they ate and choked ecstatically, Winterbourne on 
his own mission, self-appointed, the child of last night's rev- 
erie, appeared at his wife's bedside. She was quite placid. 
The time for her mid-forenoon drive was not yet ; she had 
had breakfast, and to lie unnoted, by the world forgot, was as 
near release from her haunting nervous miseries as she could 
now attain. But here was her husband, something that 
looked like eagerness shining in his eyes; really it was only 
the determination to be a good boy. 



 





" I want you to dress, Catherine,' said he, ''and come out 
for a walk." 

She looked up at him in a terrified amaze. The time was 
not many weeks ago when she would have hailed the invi- 
tation as the paean to the bride, and gone with him light- 
footed. Now she had passed into that no man's land where 
bed is the house of refuge, and its laws concern risings and 
sleepings and the administering of food. In so far as he 
would drag her forth, he was an invader, her enemy. 

"Where's Bess?" she helplessly besought him. Bess
being omniscient, would know whether this thing had to be. 

"You needn't put on all your things," he encouraged 
her. " We 're going down the back path to the Valley of 
Birds. Nobody'll see you. In ten minutes I'll knock." 

He left her, and when the door closed behind him, she 
could feel no relief. She knew he was on the other side of 
it, inexorable, and that here was the chance she had come 
back to seize — of being a wife after his own indifferent 
heart, now mysteriously requiring her. She did get up, and 
she did dress, the outer covering only her pretty niglige; 
and with a shawl over that and her braids down her back she 
looked like a frightened creature reft unprepared from home. 
She opened the door uncertainly, hoping he was gone ; but 
he was there in the plenitude of his strength and mastery. 

" That 's a good girl," said he. " Now take my arm. 
We'll slip out at the side door, and nobody'll be the wiser." 

Bess, she prayed, would be the wiser. All her hope lay 
in championship, at some random point, when they went 
through the house. But the sitting-room, the blinds closed 
toward the full sun, lay in a clouded peace. Children's voices 
came from the back, but that was not the way they were 
going. Through the door he drew her, in a haste she found 
it hard to follow, and down the path between the carrots. 



 





through the gate and into a green lane. Midway in the car- 
rots she had a recurrence of her sense that it was absurd to 
have them there, encroaching toward the house, but it was 
only a comment of the mind now. Her feelings were en- 
gaged far otherwise. Since she was going to die before they 
reached home, what matter whether carrots had been sown 
or asphodel? The lane led to a miraculous pasture here in 
the outskirts of the town, pine woods, a violet bank in the 
early days of the year, and a spring. But in the midst was a 
circular knoll, and this was where they were wont to come 
to sit, and here nested the birds who had found out that in 
Winterbourne's woods they were never shot. There was a 
peculiar orchestral effect of them here, as if the way the val- 
ley lay drew in sounds from all woodland quarters, and in 
the evening it was brave to hear the " kling " of the thrush, 
and fancy you were in deeper coverts. 

Catherine knew its beauties and repute, and that the way 
to it even, the winding lane with roses and tangled black- 
berry, was like a road to summer; but to-day the forms of 
things rose darkly before her eyes, and the smoke of glory, 
as from an altar where beauty burns before high God, was 
absent. But still he bore her along, talking a little, in his 
big voice that sounded louder than it need, and she could 
not answer. Winterbournc never heeded that from anybody. 
He was of the race of the born soliloquist. What he said 
was the innocently egotistic expression of his own mind, like 
savage man roaring in the wilderness because something in 
him demands release. After a long time, it seemed to her, 
they were in the Valley of Birds, and Winterbourne released 
her arm with a breath of content over his clever purpose. 

" Sit down on the bank, Catherine,'' he bade her. " Lie 
down. Lie on your back and look up. Don't you call this 
better than the ceiling of a room f " 



 





She did He down, but on her side, and put an arm over 
her eyes to shut out the hateful trees. 

" We must come by dawn some day," he said, disposing 
himself on the grass with satisfaction. " That 's when the 
birds get in their work. Little devils ! to say all they 've got 
to say while they 're alone ; they know we 're tied to our 
beds by sloth and civilization, because we use up every- 
thing we 've got in the course of twenty-four hours and can't 
renew ourselves in time to be up at the morning chorus. 
If we held service in the woods, we should know a few 
things we don't now." 

So he rolled on, forgetting Catherine, forgetting every pre- 
conceived determination, and conscious of what he some- 
times called, in moments of formulating, the Pan feeling, 
the sense that he was at one with his habitation, the earth. 
The earth currents ran without let through his veins, and he 
was not too old to feel his heart beat with a serene ecstasy. 
He murmured to himself now stanzas of poetry, the mean- 
ing of it, the English or the Greek of it not mattering, so 
that the sound seemed to his ears to fit the diapason of the 
time. Winterbourne felt blest, as he lay and looked up into 
his own trees. Here he was in a seclusion he could govern, 
as deep, so far as the ear and eye went, at this point, as if 
forests encompassed him. He had the robust health that 
lets a man still answer the call of beauty and of life, and dis-
