a very benign one, of curiosity. "I should say, your eye was a
lawyer and your mouth a clergyman."

"You can't tell what a man is when he is as wet as I am," said
Winthrop.

"Can't tell what he's goin' to be, nother. Well, if the rain
don't stop, we will, that's one thing."

The rain did not stop; and though the coach did, it was not
till evening had set in. And that was too late. The wet and
cold had wrought for more days than one; they brought on
disease from which even Winthrop's strong frame and spirit
could not immediately free him. He lay miserably ill all the
next day and the next night, and yet another twelve hours; and
then finding that his dues paid would leave him but one dollar
unbroken, Winthrop dragged himself as he might out of bed and
got into the stage-coach for Mannahatta which set off that
same evening.


CHAPTER XVI.


I reckon this always -- that a man is never undone till he be
hanged; nor never welcome to a place, till some certain shot
be paid, and the hostess say, welcome.
TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.


What a journey that was, of weariness and pain and strong
will. Unfit, and almost unable to travel, empty of means and
resources almost alike, he would go, -- and he was going; and
sheer determination stood in the place and filled the want of
all things beside. It was means and resources both; for both
are at the command of him who knows how to command them. But
though the will stand firm, it may stand very bare of cheering
or helping thoughts; and so did Winthrop's that live-long
night. There was no wavering, but there was some sadness that
kept him company.

The morning broke as cheerless as his mood. It had rained
during the night and was still raining, or sleeting, and
freezing as fast as it fell. The sky was a leaden grey; the
drops that came down only went to thicken the sheet of ice
that lay upon everything. No face of the outer world could be
more unpromising than that which slowly greeted him, as the
night withdrew her veil and the stealthy steps of the dawn
said that no bright day was chasing her forward. Fast enough
it lighted up the slippery way, the glistening fences, the
falling sleet which sheathed fields and houses with glare ice.
And the city, when they came to it, was no better. It was
worse; for the dolefulness was positive here, which before in
the broad open country was only negative. The icy sheath was
now upon things less pure than itself. The sleet fell where
cold and cheerlessness seemed to be the natural state of
things. Few people ventured into the streets, and those few
looked and moved as if they felt it a sad morning, which
probably they did. The very horses stumbled along their way,
and here and there a poor creature had lost footing entirely
and gone down on the ice. Slowly and carefully picking its way
along, the stage-coach drew up at last at its pace in Court
St.

The disease had spent itself, or Winthrop's excellent
constitution had made good its rights; for he got out of the
coach feeling free from pain, though weak and unsteady as if
he had been much longer ill. It would have been pleasant to
take the refreshment of brushes and cold water, for his first
step; but it must have been a pleasure paid for; so he did not
go into the house. For the same reason he did not agree to the
offer of the stage-driver to carry him and his baggage to the
end of his journey. He looked about for some more humble way
of getting his trunk thither, meaning to take the humblest of
all for himself. But porters seemed all to have gone off to
breakfast or to have despaired of a job. None were in sight.
Only a man was shuffling along on the other side of the way,
looking over at the stage-coach.

"Here, Jem -- Tom -- Patrick!" -- cried the stage-driver, --
"can't you take the gentleman's trunk for him?"

"Michael, at your service, and if it's all one t' ye," said
the person called, coming over. "I'm the boy! Will this be the
box?"

"That is it; but how will you take it?" said Winthrop.

"Sure I'll carry it -- asy -- some kind of a way," said Michael,
handling the trunk about in an unsettled fashion and seeming
to meditate a hoist of it to his shoulders. "Where will it go,
sir-r?"

"Stop, -- that won't do -- that handle won't hold," said the
trunk's master. "Haven't you a wheelbarrow here?"

"Well that's a fact," said Michael, letting the end of the
trunk down into the street with a force that threatened its
frail constitution; -- "if the handle wouldn't hould, there'd
be no hoult onto it, at all. Here! -- can't you let us have a
barrow, some one amongst ye? -- I'll be back with it afore
you'll be wanting it, I'll engage."

Winthrop seconded the application; and the wheelbarrow after a
little delay came forth. The trunk was bestowed on it by the
united efforts of the Irishman and the ostler.

"Now, don't let it run away from you, Pat," said the latter.

"It'll not run away from Michael, I'll engage," said that
personage with a capable air, pulling up first his trowsers
band and then the wheelbarrow handles, to be ready for a
start. "Which way, then, sir, will I turn?"

Winthrop silently motioned him on, for in spite of weakness of
body and weariness of spirit he felt too nervously inclined to
laugh, to trust his mouth with any demonstrations. Michael and
the wheelbarrow went on ahead and he followed, both taking the
middle of the street where the ice was somewhat broken up, for
on the sidewalk there was no safety for anybody. Indeed safety
anywhere needed to be cared for. And every now and then some
involuntary movement of Michael and the barrow, together with
some equally unlooked-for exclamation of the former, by way of
comment or explanation, startled Winthrop's eye and ear, and
kept up the odd contrast of the light with the heavy in his
mind's musings. It had ceased to rain, but the sky was as
leaden grey as ever, and still left its own dull look on all
below it. Winthrop's walk along the streets was a poor emblem
of his mind's travelling at the time; -- a painful picking the
way among difficulties, a struggle to secure a footing where
foothold there was not; the uncertain touch and feeling of a
cold and slippery world. All true, -- not more literally than
figuratively. And upon this would come, with a momentary stop
and push forward of the wheelbarrow, --

"'Faith, it's asier going backwards nor for'ards! -- Which way
will I turn, yer honour? is it up or down?"

"Straight ahead."

"Och, but I'd rather the heaviest wheeling that ever was
invinted, sooner nor this little slide of a place. -- Here we
go! -- Och, stop us! -- Och, but the little carriage has taken
me to itself intirely. It was all I could do to run ahint and
keep up wid the same. Would there be much more of the hills to
go down, yer honour, the way we're going?"

"I don't know. Keep in the middle of the street."

"Sure I'm blessed if I can keep any place!" said Michael,
whose movements were truly so erratic and uncertain that
Winthrop's mood of thoughtfulness was more than once run down
by them. -- "The trunk's too weighty for me, yer honour, -- it
will have its own way and me after it -- here we go! -- Och, it
wouldn't turn out if it was for an angel itself. Maybe yer
honour wouldn't go ahead and stop it?"

"No chance, I'm afraid," said Winthrop, whose mouth was
twitching at the trot of the Irishman's feet after the
wheelbarrow.

"Och, but we'll never get down there!" he said as he paused at
the top of a long slope. "Then I never knew before what a hard
time the carriage has to go after the horses! We'll never get
down there, yer honour?"

"Never's a great word, Michael."

"It is, sir!"

"I think you can get down there if you try."

"Very well, sir! -- I suppose I will."

But he muttered Irish blessings or cursings to himself as he
took up his trowsers and wheelbarrow handles again.

"Yer honour, do ye think we'll ever keep on our feet till the
bottom?"
