by another, in a false light in his mentor's eyes. Unwilling 
to make a serious affair of an occurrence so trivial, or to 
impute forwardness and levity of deportment to Lily, he 
was nearly as reluctant to sustain in his own proper person 
the weight of the blame Aleck ascribed to one or both of 
them. That he did blame somebody for what he had seen, 
Robert did not need his present behavior to convince him. 
He knew his ideas of a lover's honor his delicate fastidious 
ness upon some points relative to this scruples for which 
none save those who were most intimately acquainted with 
him ever gave him credit. Gay rattle and reckless flirt as 
he was generally esteemed, his chivalrous respect for true
womanhood amounted to reverence ; his recognition of innate purity was instinctive. Had he been betrothed, he
would have expected not exacted a whole-hearted de 
votion, not of the affections merely, but of the mind. If 
he scorned to exercise the slightest espionage upon the! 
movements of his fiancee or wife, left her, as free as air, to 
obey the bent of her inclinations, it would be because he 
believed, with a faith more powerful than the convictions 
produced by sight, that she was as pure as the freshest air 
ever breathed from Heaven ; that she was his heart, body, 
and imagination, incapable of cherishing a thought she 
would not impart to him ; and he would have given as 
much as he asked. His teasing talk with his aunt about 
the fabulous Gretchen, and his fine compliments to heedless 
butterflies like Virginia Shore, were the veriest lip-play, 
and every one who knew him understood the badinage and 
flattery. No girl could accuse him of more culpable trifling, 
of the most distant approach to unwarrantable familiarity 
in language or touch. 

Robert was conscious that he was sinless in respect to 
that whereof he feared his brother held him to be guilty ; 
yet, he said to himself, that he wished, since Lily's un- 







guarded, because artless action, was destined to have 
another spectator besides himself, that it had been Helen, 
and not Aleck. She would have judged of the case more 
charitably, approximated the truth more nearly. But some 
thing must be said to undeceive the real judge, and there 
was no time to be lost. 

" Aleck old boy !" He passed his arm over his brother's 
shoulder, who stood like a statue of ice under the embrace. 
" Are you thinking hardly of me ? blaming me for the 
little scene you happened to behold just now ?" 

" You are master of your own conscience and actions," 
rejoined the other, freezingly. " I do not presume to sit in 
condemnation upon either." 

" I require no stronger evidence that you have arraigned 
me already condemned me unheard," Robert said, in a 
hurt tone. " You should know me better, Aleck ! If you 
had heard the rest of the conversation you would be more 
lenient. I wish you had !" 

He waited for a response, but none came. 

"It was the simplest, most innocent of gallant farces, 
Al !" Robert resumed, in a lighter tone. 

" When a pretty woman shows her rings, 
What can a fellow do ? 

" That is an analogous quandary to the one in which you 
saw me for which you are inclined to have me hanged, 
drawn, and quartered." 

" The question is," said Aleck, turning to face his brother, 
land speaking slowly, with no softening of his severity, " the 
question is, whether a man, situated as you are, has a right, 
pr ought to have the disposition, to think of the beauty of 
any other woman ?" 

" Pshaw !" replied the other, still determined to turn the 
affair into a jest, " that dogma belongs to a former generation ; the Grandisonian race of swains and shepherdesses ; 
the age that painted Cupid blind." 

" That is very possible. My ideas upon this subject are 
decidedly antiquated, I admit ; somewhat deficient, more 
over, in tolerance of this dear passion for many that mod 
ern lovers find so delightful !" answered Aleck, crossing to 
the fireplace, and throwing himself upon the sofa. 

Nothing further passed between them for that time. I 
Even Robert's sweet temper was ruffled by the unmerited 
sneer. Their disputes were of such rare occurrence that 
reconciliation was an awkward undertaking, if either were 
disposed to attempt it. 

" Excuse me for leaving you !" cried Lily, floating into 
the room her airy motion could hardly be called walking 
" but Nelly and I have been arranging a frolic for this 
evening. Won't you, gentlemen, aid and abet us ?" 

" The better the day the better the deed ?" said Robert, 
playfully interrogative. 

He would not allow Aleck's unjust imaginings to influ 
ence his demeanor to this unsophisticated, warm-hearted 
child. 

" Yes but this is really and truly a Sunday frolic. Mr. 
Sheppard, the new circuit-rider, is to preach to the servants 
at Mr. Shore's to-night, and Ginnie has written to say that 
we must all come. She knows you came home with us to 
dinner, so she will expect both of you, certainly. I dearly 
enjoy these colored meetings don't you, Mr. Robert ?" 

" That depends upon their hue. I have found them very 
blue, and a dingy indigo at that, sometimes taking blue- 
ness and dulness as synonyms." 

" Oh ! you know what I meant ! Why will you be provoking ? Mr. Lay, I wish you would take him in hand, 
and teach him how to behave as you do." 

Aleck did not raise his eyes from his book. He would 





not be a party to this deceitful trifling. Lily gave him a 
stare of inquiry, and returned to the more complaisant 
Robert. 

"They say this Mr. Sheppard is a stirring speaker, a 
thorough-going revivalist; and the ride home by moon 
light will be splendid " 


CHAPTER VI. 

SEVEN o'clock found the quartette from Belleview in the 
revivalist's audience, at one end of Mr. Shore's long dining- 
hall. 

The white population of the neighborhood was principally 
made up of Episcopalians, with a slight sprinkling of Roman 
Catholics ; but Mr. Shore wedded for his second wife a devout Methodist, whose example and precept had wrought 
great, and, it was hoped by the reformer, radical changes in 
the religious habits of the slaves upon her own and certain 
of the surrounding plantations. The clergymen of her de 
nomination, whose itinerant habits brought them within 
range of communication with her, were urgently invited to 
visit at, and most hospitably entertained in, her house ; encouraged to establish meetings for public and social worship 
among the negroes, innovations which were not opposed, 
but rather forwarded, by her indulgent, irreligious husband. 
The gathering on this occasion was made up, for the most 
part, of colored people, a goodly assembly in number, seated 
in close rows upon benches manufactured for such purposes by 
Mrs. Shore's orders. The room was narrow in proportion 
to its length, and had a fireplace at each end. Around the 
upper one of these were ranged chairs, for the accommodation of the family and neighbors. There were about thirty 
in all ; and while the younger portion of the company had 
undoubtedly been attracted thither by the consideration that 
had moved Lily's inclination to attend, namely, the love of 






a frolic, let the day be what it might, they behaved with 
due decorum, preserved the semblance of respectful attention. It would not have been safe to act otherwise under 
Mrs. Shore's watchful eyes. 

Mr. Sheppard was suffering from hoarseness, having already delivered two sermons and conducted a class-meeting 
that day, besides riding twenty miles on horseback. He 
therefore the more gladly committed the preliminary and 
closing exercises of singing and prayer to those of the congregation who were able and willing to lighten his labors by 
taking their part in the same. Mrs. Shore joined in the
