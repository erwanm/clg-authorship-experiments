It was quickly known that Pilate, clinging to his 
reluctance to condemn the JSTazarene, had fallen back 
upon the politic Konian custom which pardoned one 
Hebrew criminal on Passover week. There lay in 
the dungeon of Herod a troublesome fellow, a noted 
revolutionist, under sentence for murder ; and pass- 
ing, strangely enough, by an ingenious alias, as Bar- 
Abbas, the son of the father. The procurator was 
bewildered when, having, in accordance with the 
traditions of the great anniversary, recommended 
the release of Jesus, there came back to him the de- 
mand that he should pardon the murderer instead. 

Pilate was plainly at his wits' end; these had 
drawn him into a difficulty from which, they proved 
unable to free him. It was said that he made 
earnest, even eager efforts to save the Naaarene 
from the fate that was upon him. It was noted that 
the governor vacillated over the case, and indeed, 
pleaded for the prisoner. It was known that but 
for the officers of the national church the Roman 
might have saved the life of the great Hebrew,

to what a consequence, who can say ? The story of 
the world's future depended on the decision of this 
one man. But Rome was passing her day of de- 
cided wills. Firmness was going out of fashion in 
the enervated national character. Pilate was a pol- 
itician, harried between a turbulent, coerced peo- 
ple and an unreasonable and exacting government. 
Annoyed and unhappy, he threw up the game at 
last, and yielded to the clamor of the Jewish nation. 

He yielded to the people ; but the people yielded 
to the priests. These pious incendiaries fired the 
popular feeling, steadily and stolidly. They would 
take no alternative ; they would listen to no compro- 
mise. They wrought the mob to a religious frenzy, 
and the Nazarene went down before it. 

The nearest friends of Jesus closed together. 
They made a little band and kept as near him as 
they dared, watching the prsetorium for sight or 
news of him. The streets were now full to bursting, 
and movement became more and more difficult. It 
was still early, with such monstrous rapidity had 
the sham trial of the Nazarene proceeded. As the 
morning advanced, the clamor in front of the palace 
grew to alarming proportions. Suddenly the yells 
and shouts of the mob became articulate. Two ter- 
rible words formed themselves out of the general 
roar. Which among those who loved the Eabbi 
best was the first to understand what those words 
meant ? They turned, each man and woman of them, 
instinctively, to spare his mother. It was too late 
for that. Were her ears a little dulled by time and 
trouble? Who can tell? Mary of Nazareth said no

word, while the air of Jerusalem quivered to the 
laceration of the outcry : 

" Crucify ! CRUCITY him ! " 



Pilate came to the balcony of the great palace of 
Herod. The superb building blazed in the strength- 
ening sunlight. The court room lay mistily within. 
Guardsmen covered every exposed spot, porticoes, 
steps, avenues ; even the roof was armed. No one 
knew how the day's riot would result. 

The Roman governor had a worried look. The 
people saw that he was agitated. A liveried slave 
brought him a basin and ewer, and began to pour 
water on his unsteady hands. Pilate held them up, 
dripping in the morning light. They were white, 
delicate hands ; the jewels on his fingers answered 
gayly to the sun. 

," I wash my hands ! I have washed them of this 
innocent blood ! " said Pilate. He spoke theatri- 
cally. But he was in earnest, as the theatrical may be. 

Then there rose from the throat of the Hebrew 
people, on their holy week, one long, sinister cry. 
Baser was never uttered by any nation. 

u His blood be upon us, and upon cm* children ! " 
*. 

A centurion came tip at this moment and roughly 
ordered back a little group of Hebrews wlio had at- 
tracted his attention by their agitated appearance, 
and their restraint of manner. A chance word of a 
bystander caused the officer to follow them with dark 
curiosity, but the person whom he sought was not 
among them. For their Lord's own sake, hia friendfi

at Bethany had not shown themselves. The pre- 
sence of Lazarus in the capital would have infuri- 
ated the Sanhedrin, and would have hastened the 
end, or deepened the sufferings, of the gentle life 
with which his own was so marvelously in. wound. 
Lazarus accepted the look of being neglectful and 
ungrateful, that he might offer the fact of loyalty* 

But where was Mary? Bearing her part in this 
cruel dilemma, with strength, with sweetness, in 
silence, hidden somewhere, invisible to Jesus, 
watching, listening, with eyes to which the mercy of 
tears was denied. No woman in Palestine hav- 
ing set apart the mother of Jesus in her solitary 
sacredness endured what the sister of Lazarus 
did that day, and lived to know that she had en- 
dured it, and yet that she could not die. 

Again on the portico of the palace appeared the 
irresolute figure of the procurator. But this time 
he was pitiably accompanied. When the mob be- 
gan to divine how, and by whom, the terrible cry 
arose once more : 

" Crucify I CRUCIFY ! " 

Pilate drew back with a gesture half dramatic, 
half sincere. At a sign from him, one in the back- 
ground was thrust forward by military hands. 

" Ecce Homo ! " cried the Roman loudly. 

There fell upon all the people a sudden and solemn 
hush. For the sight that they saw moved the basest 
soul in. the multitude, and the witnesses of it who 
were the least unworthy painfully carried its repro- 
duction to their last dream. 



THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

Jesus stood patiently, plainly to be seen, a tall 
man, symmetrically formed, in the rigor of his 
youth* A robe of crimson purple dashed royal 
color upon him. There was blood upon his brow, 
and drops which his chained hands, hanging heav- 
ily, could not wipe away, thickened upon his cheeks, 
A mutter rustled through the crowd when it was 
seen that a chaplet of thorns, woven in semblance of 
a crown, had been violently pressed, by rude hands, 
into his temples. It was soon perceived, from his 
evident physical suffering, that worse had been done 
to the man. He had passed through what was 
called the " intermediate death." The penal scourge 
of the times was often a severe weapon, a leathern 
strap, studded with spikes of iron or of bone ; nor 
was it wielded with a merciful hand. 

The sensitive flesh of the Nazarene quivered yet. 
. . His body was slightly bowed as if it still bent 
forward in the instinctive attitude of one who would, 
but cannot, avert blows. This detracted somewhat 
from his height, but nothing from his kingly de- 
meanor. His head rose nobly from his delicate, 
bared throat. His dark, brown hair and beard, 
curling and soft, finely framed a face that Palestine 
had loved before she hated, and which Rome re- 
spected while she feared. His features were strong,
