whose welcome had been too chilly at the time of 
the registration, to admit the travelers ? 

Then, remember, had come the sacred shepherds 
of the Temple, talking everywhere, telling a wonder- 
ful tale. Then, the strange birth of the steingo 
child became the topic of the town. Them, the out- 
cast family became respectable, interesting. Thou, 
the love of the dramatic, which is strong in the Jow- 
ish nature, took hold of this vivid situation. Did 
some of Mary's relations, moved by the Hiiddoii 
publicity given to family affairs, perhaps Hihrod by 
some higher feeling of regret, or shame for nogloetod 
hospitality, persuade her to accept, a tardy welcome 
under their roof ? 

At all events, the Eastern travelers found tlw 
family readily . All Bothlehcm was talking of them, 
and their affairs. The temporary tar looked down 
on the village gossip coldly. Its light and its life 
were beginning to wastes 

Were the travelers Persians? Arabians? Princcm 
Or astrologers, or both? How many were there? 
What tongue did they speak ? Greek, perlwpH,

PRESAGE 33 

The grave group in their foreign garments, these 
serious men, travel-worn, and travel-wise, regarded 
the girl mother for an instant critically. Then 
their glance fell and rested upon the baby. Their 
eyes questioned and answered each other as they 
consulted together in their own tongue, probably 
never heard before by the Galilean girl. The study 
of a scroll, the inarch of a star, the dreaming- of 
dreams, the daring to come out and be different 
from other men, the energy of ideas that could not 
bo proved until 0110 had trusted them- all this, al? 
those*, wore justified lit last. 

[fore was the Star Child. 

Moved by a nmto and common impulse, the Magi 
foil upon their foreheads. Startled, the young ino- 
thor turned her sweet face and mildly looked at them. 

Thus and then, wo have the first worshipers 
(many centuries have given its many millions) 
bowed before the Madonna and the Child. But the 
KaHtoru wages did not kneel to the woman. It was 
the nature of the men and of the times to forgot the 
woman. They had not traveled all that distance, 
all that time, to see a Jewish mother. 

The Magi bent thoir mitred heads, and kiiolt 
before the child. Deeper titan the impulsive curi- 
OHity or oven the deference of the Toinplo Shepherds 
wan the profound, intelligent reverence of those 
learned foreigners, 

Mary, looking on, povploxod and gontlo, saw sud- 
denly that the viBitorH, still upon thoir rug before 
the baby, wore opening and offering to tlie child 
strange things products of the far East. 



34 THE STOKY OF JESUS CHRIST 

Joseph, coming in, and being wiser than Mary 
about such matters, perceived at once the meaning 
of what he saw. 

For the gifts in the hands, on the laps, of the 
Magi were the typical offerings of subjects to a 
King, and in no other wise to 1>6 interpreted. 
There could be no doubt about it. Hero was the 
child to whom Joseph and Mary were becoming 
quite accustomed, already wondering i the baby 
were so Tery different from others after all ; a litllo, 
helpless, human, nestling being, to be warmed and 
cherished on a mother's heart. 

And there were the sages worshiping a monarch. 
The glitter of gold shone out of dunky ba#s ; it <li<l 
not attract the baby's eyes. Spicy, Oriumtal odoru 
filled the air. Frankincense sent up its pnngonl; 
perfume, strong as the heart of lovo. And thorn, 
ah, there was myrrh, bittor as life, and UH ol<l to 
the fancy of the East as the coromonutls of doui.li. 

Only the wise recognize power in the woak. Th<*. 
Eastern scholars knolt humbly and "happily boforo 
4;he babe of Bethlehem. It would luivo boon diffi- 
cult for the learned to follow thoir thoughta. Mary 
could not. But she clasped the* child, anil won*

Their faces wore a rapt and rovwait look. Tlwy

the most practical effects on human affairs, they 
struck Jerusalem from their homeward route, and 
omitted the courtesies of the palace on their return. 
A royal murderer, scowling from his windows, 
watched in vain for his Eastern guests. He had 
miscalculated their shrewd simplicity.

Dreadful rumors of more dreadful facts ran whis-

Jerusalem, liome was represented by a monster. 
Cruelty was his pastime, and murder his passion. 
One of hit* worst manias was a senseless jealousy

In the homes of the oppressed people, ghastly

It was said that something had befallen the High-
