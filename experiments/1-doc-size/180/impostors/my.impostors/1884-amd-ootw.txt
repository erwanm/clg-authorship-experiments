at the complication ; for she was suffering on every side, 
while the Wilders seemed scarcely touched, for the Cav- 
endish Moreton visit had swallowed up smaller matters. 
To be left out of all those gatherings was a positive 
insult. 

About a fortnight later Mrs. Marshall received a note 
from her son begging for a little money. Business was 



OR, WAS IT A VICTORY? Ill 

dull, and he had found nothing to do ; but he meant to go 
to work. He must have some clothes, and he had not a 
cent with which to get a meal. The mother's heart soft- 
ened toward him; it had never been hard for any one 
save Eleanor. 

She had to ask her daughter to get her some money, 
as she was not able to go out. 

" This will be intolerable ! " said Mrs. Vanduyne angrily. 
" Why doesn't he go to Eleanor ? She is so much the 
style in her new business that she could afford to throw 
him a bone. It is very nice to take all one's years of 
prosperity and turn one out in adversity ! " 

This time Mrs. Marshall sent her son twenty-five dol- 
lars. Kate added a few stinging words of advice. She 
had not inquired very deeply into the matter, but from 
what she had gathered she knew Tom's haunts were 
most disreputable. What was to be done ? 

There was one course. She would shut up the house 
and go to some fashionable seaside. The Mountjoys and 
Wilders would be at Newport; she could try Long 
Branch, and when she tired of that there was Lake 
George and Saratoga. The rest was Eleanor's business — 
let her fight it out. 

So the house was put in order for a flitting. Valuables 
were sent away, closets double locked, windows nailed 
down and doors bolted, and one trusty servant left to 
mount guard. Mrs. Marshall's health was made the 
excuse for so early a departure. And as Mrs. Vanduyne 
shook the dust of the city from her silken garments, her 
whole heart rose in bitter judgment against her sister-in- 
law. It did not occur to her that Eleanor's burden of 
the last five or six years had been heavy, although she 
found the merest tithe of it so intolerable. 

Thomas Marshall, gentleman and college graduate, with 
tli at certain fine intangibleness of pure old blood that 
had filtered through a refined and honored race, went to 





a second-hand clothing store and shed his rags, now that 
the needle of his industrious wife could no longer be 
used in his behalf. Then he paid a two weeks' score at a 
cheap lodging-house ; he would make sure of that shelter. 
Afterward came a sickening debauch, from which he 
roused to find himself again destitute. He hunted up 
odd jobs, he lived as such people do, — going hungry, 
crawling into any kind of shelter for the night, and 
grudging the very clothes he wore that he could not sell 
them for rum. 

Now and then, when his brain was not altogether stupe- 
fied, he bethought himself of what his mother and sister 
had said of Eleanor. What right had she to go off and 
leave him to struggle alone ? If he was weak and easily 
tempted, so much the more need of his clinging to some 
one. If anything would induce a man to reform, it would 
be the tender association of wife and children. What if 
he had cast Eleanor off in the day of his misfortune and 
failure ? He strengthened himself in virtuous indignation 
with this thought. He had a right to go to her and 
demand another chance. There was no opportunity of 
getting at his mother, and as for Kate — yes, he would go 
to Eleanor, not as any humble suppliant, but as her mas- 
ter, armed with the rights the law had bestowed upon 
him at the marriage altar. 

Much as Mrs. Marshall pondered over the fate of her 
husband, she was unfeignedly thankful that he had not 
molested her. She even began to suspect that she had 
been over hasty in invoking the law for her protection. 
So far she had prospered beyond her wildest expectations. 
True, her own relatives, true to class instincts, had let 
her severely alone ; but many old friends had been really 
cordial. Perhaps it was her own fine adaptiveness that 
had won them. As Mrs. Waterman said, she neither 
reached up to the forbidden fruit, nor railed at the grapes 
for not turning their royal purple bloom to her. She was 



 

a business woman, a milliner who understood the rare ait 
of making other women quite as beautiful as circum- 
stances would permit. She even suggested different 
styles of hair-dressing to enable a customer to wear some 
coveted shape or desired trimming; and when women 
glanced at themselves, and saw their best points brought 
out, they took her to their hearts of vanity and self love, 
In such a world there were no social calls, dainty lun- 
cheons, and exquisite garden parties. 

On the other hand, she held herself regally above any- 
thing but business. She had dwelt so long on the golden 
side that she understood class feeling and prejudice thor- 
oughly, and avoided all chance for slights or wounds, with 
the fine breeding of higher knowledge than mere rules. 
True, now and then, some overbearing customer had at- 
tempted insolence ; but it was checked by her brave and 
steady eye. Once the wife of a contractor who in a few 
years had amassed a fortune sent for her to consult about 
some orders she wished to give ; but Mrs. Marshall's an- 
swer was so to the point that, after fuming awhile over the 
extreme ignorance of business people, she descended upon 
her in all her state and majesty, and began with insuffer- 
able insolence. Mrs. Marshall listened to her harangue. 

" I think, Mrs. Chedister," she said in her clear, incisive 
voice, that seemed to cut as it went, " that I hardly care 
to number you among my customers. I shall probably 
not be able to suit you, and in a large city like New York 
there is a greater variety to choose from than it would pay 
me to keep. I am extremely busy, and have the honor of 
wishing you good-morning." 

Mrs. Marshall turned with the dignity of an empress, 
and left her lofty customer standing at the counter. 

" O Mrs. Marshall," cried one of the girls, " that was 
too good ! To think of Mrs. Chedister putting on so 
much magnificence, when she worked in a factory before 
die was married, and Mr. Chedister kept an oyster saloon. 





It is even said that she used to bake for the saloon lunches. 
Not that it hurt her, but she of all others has no right to 
despise labor." 

The story did get whispered about, much to Mrs. Ched- 
ister's discomfiture. 

On the other hand, Mrs. Marshall found herself making 
some really delightful friends, that she could not have met 
with in her old life. Mr. and Mrs. Bradford came fre- 
quently. They were plain, well-to-do people, with much 
general information, and that clean, strong, wholesome air 
so inspiriting. Mrs. Bradford was extremely fond of chil- 
dren, and took a great fancy to the two younger ones, 
Celia being much engrossed with her studies, and her own 
fairy dreams. 

There was one other person who had touched Eleanor 
with that intuitive nearness born only in people capable 
of some of the highest strains of friendship; this was 
Mrs. Van Cleve. About her there was no question in 
Westwater. It was not merely wealth and honorable 
records ; there had been statesmen, a bishop or two, pro- 
fessors of note, savants who added some brilliant discov- 
eries and stamped solid truths into the literature of their 
own times. Its ladies, too, had been the peerless kind of 
women who are acknowledged queens without much heart- 
burning, their lovely and gracious superiority being a kind 
of birthmark. 

As Miss Parker predicted, she had been caught by the 
bonnet, which proved charmingly becoming ; she had also
