notion of what lies before her, brother Rhys."
"When did you make your observations?"
"She was with me, you know--you left her with me this morning. We were
alone, and we had a little conversation."
"Mrs. Balliol, do you think a just notion of anything call be formed
in half an hour?"
His question was rather grave, and the lady's eyes wavered from meeting
his. She fidgeted a little.
"O you know best, of course," she said; "I have had very little
opportunity--I only judged from the want of seriousness; but that might
have been from some other cause. You must excuse me, if I spoke too
frankly."
"You can never do that to me," he said. "Thank you, sister Balliol. I
will take care of her."
Mrs. Balliol was reassured. But neither during their walk home nor ever
after, did Mr. Rhys tell Eleanor of this little bit of talk that had
concerned her.
CHAPTER XX.
AT WORK.
  "My Lady comes; my Lady goes; he can see her day by day,
  And bless his eyes with her beauty, and with blessings strew her way."
The breakfast-table was as much of a mystery to Eleanor as the dinner
had been. Not because it looked so homelike; though in the early
morning the doors and windows were all open and the sunlight streaming
through on Mrs. Caxton's china cups and silver spoons. It all looked
foreign enough yet, among those palm-fern pillars, and on the Fijian
mat with its border made of red worsted ends and little white feathers.
The basket of fruit, too, on the table, did not look like England. But
the tea was unexceptionable, and there was a piece of fresh fish as
perfectly broiled as if it had been brought over by some genius or
fairy, smoking hot, from an English gridiron. And in the order and
arrangements of the table, there had been something more than native
skill and taste, Eleanor was sure.
"It seems to me, Mr. Rhys," she said, "that the Fijians are remarkably
good cooks!"
"Uncommon, for savages," said Mr. Rhys with perfect gravity.
"This fish is excellent."
"There is no better fish-market in the world, for variety and
abundance, than we have here."
"But I mean, it is broiled just like an English fish. Isaac Walton
himself would be satisfied with it."
"Isaac Walton never saw such fishing as is carried on here. The natives
are at home in the water from their childhood--men and women both;--and
the women do a good deal of the fishing. But the serious business is
the turtle fishing. It is a hand to hand conflict. The men plunge into
the water and grapple bodily with the turtle, after they have brought
them into an enclosure with their nets. Four or five men lay hold of
one, if it is a large fellow, and they struggle together under water
till the turtle thinks he has the worst of the bargain, and concludes
to come to the surface."
"Does not the turtle sometimes get the better?"
"Sometimes."
"Mr. Rhys, have you any particular duty to-day?"
"I don't see how you can keep up that form of expression!" said he,
with a comic gravity of dislike.
"Why not?"
"It is not treating me with proper confidence."
Her look in reply was so very pretty, both blushing and winsome, that
the corners of his mouth were obliged to give way.
"You know what my first name is, do not you?"
"Yes," said Eleanor.
"The people about call me 'Misi Risi'--I am not going to have my wife a
Fijian to me."
The lights on Eleanor's face were very pretty. With the same contained
smile he went on.
"I gave you my name yesterday. It is yours to do what you like with;
but the greatest dishonour you can shew to a gift, is not to use it at
all."
"That is the most comical putting of the case that ever I heard," said
Eleanor, quite unable to retain her own gravity.
"Very good sense," said Mr. Rhys, with a dry preservation of his.
"But after all," said Eleanor, "you gave me your second name, if you
please--I do not know what I have to do with the first."
"You do not? Is it possible you think your name is Henry or James, or
something else? You are Rowland Rhys as truly as I am--only you are the
mistress, and I am the master."
Eleanor's look went over the table with something besides laughter in
the brown eyes, which made them a gentle thing to see.
"Mr. Rhys, I am thinking, what you will do to this part of you to make
it like the other?"
He gave her a glance, at which her eyes went down instantly.
"I do not know," he said with infinite gravity. "I will think about it.
Preaching does not seem to do you any good."
Eleanor bent her attention upon her bread and fruit. He spoke next with
a change of tone, giving up his gravity.
"Do you know your particular duty to-day?"
"I thought," said Eleanor,--"that as yesterday you shewed me the
head-carpenter, perhaps this morning you would let me see the chief
cook."
"That is not the first thing. You must have a lesson in Fijian; now
that I hope you are instructed in English."
He carried her off to his study to get it. The lesson was a matter of
amusement to Mr. Rhys, but Eleanor set herself earnestly to learn. Then
he said he supposed she might as well see her establishment at once,
and took her out to the side of the house where she had not been.
It was a plantation wilderness here too, though particularly devoted to
all that in Fiji could belong to a kitchen garden. English beans and
peas had been sown, and were flourishing; most of the luxuriance that
met the eye had a foreign character. Beautiful order was noticeable
everywhere. Mr. Rhys seemed to have forgotten all about the servants;
he pleased himself with leading Eleanor through the walks and shewing
her which were the plants of the yam and the kumera and other native
fruits and vegetables. Bananas were here too, and the graceful stems of
the sugar cane; and overhead the cocoa-nut trees waved their feathery
plumes in the air.
"Who did all this?" Eleanor asked admiringly.
"Solomon--with a head gardener over him."
"Solomon is--I saw him yesterday?"
"Yes. He came with me from Vulanga. He is a nice fellow. He is a
Christian, as I told you; and a true labourer in the great vineyard. I
believe he never misses an opportunity to speak to his countrymen in a
quiet way and tell them the truth. He has brought a great many to know
it. In my service he is very faithful."
"No wonder this garden looks nice," said Eleanor.
"I asked Solomon one day about his religious experience. He said he was
very happy; he had enjoyed religion all the day. He said he rose early
in the morning and prayed that the Lord would greatly bless him and
keep him; and that it had been so, and generally was so when he
attended to religious duties early in the morning. 'But if I neglect
and rush into the world,' he said, 'without properly attending to my
religious duties, nothing goes right. I am wrong in my own heart, and
no one round me is right.'"
"Good testimony," said Eleanor. "Is he your cook as well as your
gardener?"
"I had forgotten all about the cook," said Mr. Rhys. "Come and see the
kitchen."
Near the main dwelling house, in this planted enclosure, were several
smaller houses. Mr. Rhys at last took Eleanor that way, and permitted
her to inspect them. The one nearest the main building was fitted for a
laundry. The furthest was a sleeping house for the servants. The middle
one was the kitchen. It was a Fijian kitchen. Here was a large
fireplace, of the original fashion which had moved Eleanor's wonder in
the dining-room; with a Fijian framework of wood at one side of it,
holding native vessels of pottery, larger and smaller, and variously
shaped, for cooking purposes. Some more homelike iron utensils were to
be seen also; with other kitchen appurtenances, water jars and so
forth. A fire had been in the fireplace, and the signs of cookery were
remaining; but in all the houses, nobody was anywhere visible.
"Solomon is gone to collect your servants," said Mr. Rhys. "That
explains the present solitude."
"Did he cook that fish?"
"I have not tried him in cooking," said Mr. Rhys with a gravity that
was perfect. "I do not know what he could do if he was tried."
"Who did it then?"
His smile was wonderfully pleasant--now that it could be no longer kept
back--as he answered, "Your servant."
"You, Rowland! And the dinner yesterday?"
"Do not praise me," he said with the same look, "lest I should spoil
the dinner to-day. I do not expect there will be anybody here till
afternoon."
"Then you shall see what I can do!"
"I do not believe you know how. I have been long enough in the
wilderness to learn all trades. You never learned how to cook at
Wiglands."
"But at Plassy I did."
"Did aunt Caxton let you into her kitchen?"
"Yes."
"I shall not let you into mine."
"She went with me there. I have not come out here to be useless. I will
take care of the dinner to-day."
"No, you shall not," said Mr. Rhys, drawing her away from the kitchen.
"You have got enough to do to-day in unpacking boxes. There will be
servants this evening to attend to all you want; and for the present
you are my care."
"Rowland, I should like it."
Which view of the case did not seem to be material. At least it was
answered in a silencing kind of way, as with his arm about her he led
her in through the bananas to the house. It silenced Eleanor
effectually, in spite of being very serious in her wish. She put it
away to bide another opportunity.
Mr. Rhys gave her something else to do, as he had said. The boxes had
in part been brought from the schooner, and there was employment for
both of them. He drew out nails, and took off covers, and did the rough
unpacking; while the arranging and bestowing of the goods thus put
under her disposal kept Eleanor very busy. His part of the work was
finished long before hers, and Mr. Rhys withdrew to his study for some
other work. Eleanor, happy and busy, with touched thoughts of Mrs.
Caxton, put away blankets and clothes and linen and calicos, and
unpacked glass, and stowed on her shelves a whole store of home
comforts and necessaries; marvelling between whiles at Mr. Rhys's
