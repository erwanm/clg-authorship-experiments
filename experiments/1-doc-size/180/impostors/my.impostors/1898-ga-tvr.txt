to Don Tiburcio, but of many of his neigh 
bours, which would be driven over to his 
rancho for the operation. This was one 
of the great occasions of the year. Im 
mediately after breakfast the neighbours 
began to arrive, magnificently mounted, 
sparkling with gold and silver lace, their 
wives and daughters each surrounded by 
her cavalcade. About ten the gorgeous 
company, led by the host, started for an 
immense corral about three miles from 
the house. The boys were well to the 
front, and established themselves on the 
wall of the corral. The rest of the party 
remained on their horses, but mounted the 
little slopes. The green winter landscape 



 

had suddenly become a blaze of colour, 
and never was there a more animated 
scene. Over all hung a light haze. The 
distant mountains, which could be seen 
from the outer valley, were almost invisible.
The priest, a huge brown figure, on 
his big brown horse, stood on the very 
apex of the highest knoll. 

Presently, from various directions rose 
a low deep murmur, then a rumble of 
growing volume as of an approaching 
earthquake. Men and women grasped 
their bridles with firmer fingers, and 
pressed still nearer to the crests of the 
many mounds. Then over the hills on 
every side came a mass of tossing horns 
and sleek shining bodies, separated here 
and there by a shouting vaquero, whose 
black and silver seemed pierced at every 
point by those white curving horns. The 
cattle, several thousand in number, trotted 
over the hills and toward the corral swiftly, 
but in good order, held well in check by 
the careful vaqueros. There was no cheer 
ing, for excitement was to be avoided. 
The cattle would stand any amount of the 



 

shouting they were used to, but little from 
unaccustomed throats. 

In the corral, at its farther end, stood, 
by an oven, a tall muscular Indian, the 
most famous brander in that part of the 
country. He was stripped to the waist, 
and as the first steer was driven through 
the narrow gate, he plucked a red-hot 
iron from the coals. The beast, kicking 
and bellowing, was flung to the ground 
by a dexterous twist of his tail, two more 
Indians held him in position, and the 
branding was accomplished. 

Almost before he was up another was 
prostrate ; and they followed each other in 
such rapid succession that the wonder 
was some were not branded twice. As 
fast as each brute received his mark he 
was driven out of another gate and over 
the hills, lest his ill-nature should be the 
cause of wild disorder. 

The vaqueros handled their dangerous 
charges with admirable skill, keeping those 
to be branded in groups of a hundred or 
more at some distance from the corral, 
riding round them constantly with peremptory 
shouts. Other vaqueros, belong 
ing to the same herd, segregated the 
animals immediately required and drove 
them in a straight line for the corral. 
There was not a moment of pause. The 
vaqueros, the brander, and his assistants 
seemed impervious to fatigue ; the cattle, 
shifting uneasily in their bands, leaped 
eagerly from the lines at the first signal 
from the vaquero bearing down on them 
like a fury from the corral. On the far 
side, otherwise deserted, the sore indig 
nant beasts scampered as fast as their legs 
could carry them whithersoever their 
vaquero chose to drive. 

After two hours or more, the atmos 
phere was charged with a certain breath 
less excitement, as was natural enough. 
The constant cyclonic rush of vaqueros 
and cattle, the angry bellowings, the in 
creasing masses of animals, the furious 
shouts of the men, had changed a peace 
able landscape into a vast theatre full of 
tragic possibilities. The waiting cattle 
were growing more and more restless, and 
there was a low rumble among them. 



 

Don Tiburcio motioned to his guests that 
it was time to leave ; moreover, it was nearly
the dinner hour. 



" Rafael ! " he called. His son turned 
his head impatiently, but prepared to 
obey ; the California!! youth was brought 
up on rigid lines. 

" Ay, must we go ? " cried Adan. " I 
could stand here till night, even without 
dinner, my friends." 

" I, too, am sorry," began Roldan. " But 
what is the matter ? " 

The great masses of cattle had begun 
to heave suddenly. They were uttering 
hoarse growls of terror. The mustangs 
of the vaqueros stood suddenly still, quiv 
ering. Then, abruptly, a horrible stillness 
fell. All things breathing seemed to pet 
rify. But only for numbered seconds. 
From beneath came a low roar, gather 
ing in volume like the progression of a 
tidal wave; then the world heaved and 
rocked. 

" Temblor ! temblor ! " went up as from 
one mighty horrified throat. The priest 
shouted to the boys : " Stay where you 


are;" to Don Tiburcio and his guests: 
" With all your speed after me." 

They understood his meaning. The 
cattle were leaping over one another, 
bellowing madly, giving no heed to the 
hoarse cries of the terrified vaqueros. In 
a moment a blaze of colour was flying 
down the valley, a long brown arm lifted 
high above it. In twenty seconds five 
thousand tossing horns and blazing eyes 
and heaving flanks were in pursuit. 

The vaqueros did their best, although 
their faces were white and their lips
shaking. Three that were between the unit 
ing herds, had their legs crushed into their 
mustangs sides, and were borne along and 
aloft, shrieking horribly, adding to the fury 
of the stampede. Another, trying to head 
the cattle off, rode into a sudden split in 
the hard adobe soil and went down beneath 
those iron feet. 

The boys clung together. The wall 
was broad, but it rocked continuously, 
whether from other shocks or from the 
hoof-assaulted earth it would have been 
impossible to say. A curving outer flank
