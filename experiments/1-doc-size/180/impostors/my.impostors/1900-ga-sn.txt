Her mind being at rest, she arose at four on the 
morning of Saturday. 

She rowed across the lake this time and picked up 
Senator North about a half-mile from the hotel. His 
hands were full of fishing-tackle. 

"Will you take me fishing?" he said. "Can you 
give me the whole morning? I hear there is better 
fishing in the lake above, and a farmhouse where we 
can get breakfast. Do you know the way?" 

She nodded, and he took the oars from her and 
rowed up the lake. 

" My wife always sleeps until noon," he said. " We 
can have seven hours if you will give them to me." 

" Of course I'll give them to you. I may as well 
admit that I intended to have them. I made an elab- 
orate disposition of my household to that end." 

They were smiling at each other, and both looked 
happy and free of desire for anything but seven long 
hours of pleasant companionship. The morning, 
bright and full of sound, mated itself with the superficial moods of man, and was not cast for love-making. 

" Well, what have you been doing? " he asked. " I 
have had you in a permanent and most refreshing 
vision, floating up and down this lake, or flitting through 




the forest, in that white frock. I know that Burleigh 
was here " 

" I did not wear white for him." 

" Ah ! He has looked very vague, not to say mooning, since his return. I am thankful he is not seeing 
you exactly as I do. How is the lady of the 
shadows ? " 

" Sally's Southern gorge rose so high, after she discovered the taint, that she left precipitately. She 
couldn't.sit at the table with even a hidden drop of 
negro blood." 

" You Southerners will solve the negro problem by 
inspiring the entire race with an irresistible desire to 
cut its throat. If a tidal wave would wash Ireland out 
of existence and the blacks in this country would dispose of themselves, how happy we all should be ! What 
else have you been doing? " 

" I have read the Congressional Record every day, 
and the Federalist and State papers of Hamilton ; to 
say nothing of the monographs in the American 
Statesmen Series. Mr. Burleigh insisted that I must 
acquire the national sense, and I have acquired it to 
such an extent that half the time I don't know whether 
I am living in history or out of it. Even the Record 
makes me feel impersonal, and as ' national ' as Mr. 
Burleigh could wish." 

" Burleigh intends that his State shall be proud of 
you." 

Betty flushed. " Don't prophesy, even in fun. I 
believe I am superstitious. His idea is that politics are 
to become a sort of second nature with me before I 
start my salon Why do you smile cynically? Don't 
you think I can have a salon ? " 



 

" You might build up one in the course of ten years if 
you devoted your whole mind to it and made no mistakes; nothing is impossible. But for a long while 
you merely will find yourself entertaining a lot of men 
who want to talk on any subject but politics after they 
have turned their backs on Capitol Hill. They will be 
extremely grateful if you will provide them with some 
lively music, a reasonable amount of punch, and an un- 
limited number of pretty and entertaining women. But 
don't expect them to invite you down the winding ways 
of their brains to the cupboards where they have hung 
up their great thoughts for the night. I do not even 
see them standing in groups of three, their right hands 
thrust under their coat fronts, gravely muttering at each 
other. I see them invariably doing their poor best to 
make some pretty woman forget they could be bores if 
they were not vigilant." 

" The pretty women I shall ask will not think them 
bores. The thing to do at first, of course, is to get 
them there." 

" Oh, there will be no difficulty about that. Why do 
you want a salon ? Are you ambitious ? " 

Betty nodded. "Yes, I think I am. At first I 
only wanted a new experience. Now that I have 
met so many men with careers, I want one too. If 
I succeed, I shall be the most famous woman in 
America." 

" You certainly would be. Very well, I will do all 
I can to help you. It is possible, as I said. And you 
have many qualifications " 

"Ah ! " Betty's face lit up. " If there is war with 
Spain, they will talk of nothing else Don't frown so 
at me. I 'm sure I don't want a war if you don't. 



 

Those are my politics. Here is the water lane between 
the two lakes. I almost had forgotten it. I hope it 
isn't overgrown." 

She spoke lightly, but more truly than she was wholly 
willing to admit. Women see political questions, as 
they see all life, through the eyes of some man. If he 
is not their lover, he is a public character for whom they 
have a pleasing sentiment. 

Senator North pulled into the long winding lane of 
water in a cleft of the mountains. It was dark and 
chill here ; they were in the heart of the forest ; they 
had but to turn their heads to look straight into the 
long vistas, heavy with silence and shadows. 

He rowed for some moments without speaking. He 
felt their profound and picturesque isolation, and had 
no desire to break the spell of it. She recalled her 
wish that the Adirondacks would swing off into space, 
but smiled : she was too happy in the mere presence of 
the man to wish for anything more. He let his eyes 
meet hers and linger in their depths, and when he 
smiled at the end of that long communion it was with 
tenderness. But when he spoke he addressed himself 
to her mind alone. 

" No, you must not wish for war with Spain. If we 
ever are placed in a position where patriotism commands war, I shall be the last to oppose it. If Eng- 
land had not behaved with her calm good sense at the 
time of the Venezuela difficulty, but had taken our 
jingoes seriously and returned their insults, we should 
have had no alternative but war, the serious and conservative of the country would have had to suffer from 
the errors of its fools, as is often the case. But for this 
war there would be no possible excuse. Spain at one 



 

time owned nearly two-thirds of the earth's surface. 
She has lost every inch of it, except the Peninsula and 
a few islands, by her cruelty and stupidity. Her manifest destiny is to lose these islands in the same manner 
and for the same reasons. And brutal and stupid as she 
is, we have no more right to interfere in her domestic 
affairs than had Europe to interfere in ours when we 
were torn by a struggle that had a far greater effect on 
the progress of civilization than the trouble between 
dissatisfied colonists and decadent Spaniards in this 
petty island. God only knows how many intellects 
went out on those battlefields in the four years of the 
Civil War, which, had they persisted and developed, 
would have added to the legislative wisdom of this 
country. We knew what we were losing, knew that 
the longer the struggle lasted the longer would our 
growth as a nation be retarded, and the horrors of 
our battlefields were quite as ghastly as anything set 
forth in the reports from Cuba. And yet every think- 
ing man among us, young and old, turned cold with 
apprehension when we were threatened with a European 
interference which would have dishonored us. That
