and partly because I really thought I could help 
her. But I soon came to realize that influencing 
Claire was like moulding water; it flowed back 
round your hands, even while you worked. I 
would argue with her about the physiological 



 

effects of alcohol, and when I had convinced her, 
she would promise caution; but soon I would 
discover that my arguments had gone over her 
head. I was at this time feeling my way towards 
my work in the East. I tried to interest her 
in such things as social reform, but realized that 
they had no meaning for her. She was living 
the life of the pleasure-seeking idlers of the 
great metropolis, and every time I met her it 
seemed to me that her character and her appear- 
ance had deteriorated. 

Meantime I picked up scraps of information 
concerning the van Tuivers. There were 
occasional items in the papers: their yacht, the 
"Triton", had reached the Azores; it had run 
into a tender in the harbor of Gibraltar; Mr. 
and Mrs. van Tuiver had received the honor 
of presentation at the Vatican; they were spend- 
ing the season in London, and had been presented 
at court; they had been royal guests at the 
German army-maneuvers. The million wage- 
slaves of the metropolis, packed morning and 
night into the roaring subways and whirled to 
and from their tasks, read items such as these 
and were thrilled by the triumphs of their fellow- 
coimtrymen. 

At Claire's house I learned to be interested in 
"society" news. From a weekly pap>er of gossip 
about the rich and great she would read para- 
graphs, explaining subtle allusions and laying 
bare veiled scandals. Some of the men she 
knew well, referring to them for my benefit as 



 

Bertie and Reggie and Vivie and Algie. She 
also knew not a little about the women of that 
super-world — information sometimes of an inti- 
mate nature, which these ladies would have 
been startled to hear was "going the rounds." 

This insight I got into Claire's world I found 
useful, needless to say, in my occasional forays 
as a soap-box orator of Socialism. I would go 
from the super-heated luxury of her home to 
visit tenement-dens where little children made 
paper-flowers twelve and fourteen hom-s a day 
for a trifle over one cent an hoiu-. I would 
spend the afternoon floating about in the park 
in the automobile of one of her expensive friends, 
and then take the subway and visit one of the 
settlements, to hear a discussion of conditions 
which doomed a certain number of working- 
girls to be burned ahve every year in factory- 
fires. 

As time went on, I became savage concerning 
such contrasts, and the speeches I was making 
for the party began to attract attention. Dur- 
ing the siunmer, I recollect, I had begun to feel 
hostile even towards the lovely image of Sylvia, 
which I had framed in my room. While she 
was being presented at St. James's, I was study- 
ing the glass-factories in South Jersey, where 
I foxmd little boys of ten working in front of 
glowing furnaces until they dropped of exhaus- 
tion, and sometimes had their eyes burned out. 
While she and her husband were guests of the 
German Emperor, I was playing the part of a Polish 
working-woman, penetrating the carefully guarded 
secrets of the sugar-trust's domain in Brooklyn, 
where human lives are snuffed out almost every 
day in noxious fumes. 

And then in the early fall Sylvia came home, 
her honeymoon over. She came in one of the 
costly suites in the newest of the de luxe steam- 
ers; and the next morning I saw a pictiire of 
her, and read a few words her husband had 
condescended to say to a fellow-traveler about 
the courtesy of Europe to visiting Americans. 
Then for several months I heard no more of 
them. I was busy with my child-labor work, 
and I doubt if a thought of Sylvia crossed my 
mind, until that never-to-be-forgotten afternoon 
at Mrs. Allison's when she came up to me and 
took my hand in hers. 



 

Mks. Roland Allison was one of the com- 
fortable in body who had begun to feel uncom- 
fortable in mind. I had happened to meet her 
at the settlement, and tell her what I had seen 
in the glass-factories; whereupon she made up 
her mind that everybody she knew must hear 
me talk, and to that end gave a reception at her 
Madison Avenue home. 

I don't remember much of what I said, but 
if I may take the evidence of Sylvia, who remem- 
bered everything, I spoke effectively. I told 
them, for one thing, the story of little Angelo 
Patri. Little Angelo was of that indeterminate 
Italian age where he helped to support a dnmken 
father without regard to the child-labor laws of 
the State of New Jersey. His people were ten- 
ants upon a fruit-farm a couple of miles from 
the glass-factory, and httle Angelo walked to 
and from his work along the railroad-track. It 
is a peculiarity of the glass-factory that it has 
to eat its children both by day and by night; 
and after working six hoiu-s before midnight and 
six more after midnight, httle Angelo was tired. 
He had no eye for the birds and flowers on a 
beautiful spring morning, but as he was walking 
home, he dropped in his tracks and fell asleep. 
The driver of the first morning train on that 
branch-line saw what he took to be an old coat 

lying on the track ahead, and did not stop to 
investigate. 

All this had been narrated to me by the child's 
mother, who had worked as a packer of "beers", 
and who had loved little Angelo. As I repeated 
her broken words about the poor mangled body, 
I saw some of my auditors wipe away a sur- 
reptitious tear. 

After I had stopped, several women came up 
to talk with me; at the last, when most of the 
company was departing, there came one more, 
who had waited her turn. The first thing I saw 
was her loveliness, the thing about her that 
dazzled and stunned people; and then came the 
strange sense of familiarity. Where had I met 
this girl before? 

She said what everybody always says; she 
had been so much interested, she had never 
dreamed that such conditions existed in the 
world. I, applying the acid test, responded, 
"So many people have said that to me that 
I have begun to believe it." 

"It is so in my case," she replied, quickly. 
"You see, I have lived all my life in the South, 
and we have no such conditions there." 

"Are you sure?" I asked. 

"Our negroes at least can steal enough to 
eat," she said. 

I smiled. Then — since one has but a moment 
or two to get in one's work in these social affairs, 
and so has to learn to thrust quickly: "You 
have timber-workers in Louisiana, steel-workers 



in Alabama. You have tobacco-factories, can- 
ning-factories, cotton-mills — have you been to
