along o' goin' to the tavern and seein' that John Gil- 
bert. O my ! I forgot all about them g's. I can't be 
a lady, it wasn't born in me, and that's why you 
look down on me despise me ! " 

"No. Heaven knows I don't despise you, Joe. And 
I'd like to bring you up out of this swamp of vilenesa 
and darkness that we've ploughed along in all our lives. 
I loathe the very sight of it. I am changed. Maybe 
John Gilbert's had a hand in it, maybe not. I did 
take his rigmarole for gospel truth first ; but if it's so 
grand and fine, why doesn't he make his own life 
better? Why doesn't he go somewhere, if there is any 
such place, and be free and happy, following out the 
laws of truth and harmony ? What's the theory worth 
if there's to be no practice ? Better let men go on eat- 
ing and drinking, and grovelling like brutes, than stir 
them up to fierce tumults, and leave them there, chafing 
like angry tigers. So I'm about done with the non- 
sense. But there is something, Joe. Call it God, or 
Fate, or the Devil. And I shall never rest until I 
have a 'good hand-to-hand fight." 




"I wish you'd go to church, Stephen," Joe said. 
"Ministers know better than other folks." 

"Do they? I'm not so sure of that. They preach 
about content, and patience, and resignation ; but when 
a man begins to learn his own strength, when he feels 
his own wants and needs, what good will a crust of 
bread do? Can you feed a starving soul on it? 
There's an ache and an agony way down deep ; there's 
a capacity for something that struggles in bonds, and 
will be free ; and, when a man comes to this, he must 
fight it out. So, if I'm cross to you, Joe, blame it to 
the devil, that possesses me ! " 

His tone was deep and passionate, and Joe stared 
in affright. He was beyond her reach. His head was 
full of these new-fangled notions. Her narrow mind, 
bounded only by yesterday and to-morrow, could not 
comprehend the mighty conflict the man was going 
through. A little fondling and foolish caresses would 
have been more to her than his victory or defeat. And 
because she could not argue, she relapsed into sullen- 
ness the unfailing refuge of weak natures. Sally 
Fawcett, fat and rosy at forty, with her six unruly 
children, and Jake, " who never gave her a word when 
he was in liquor," was as high a type of happiness as 
Joe aspired to. For Jake was fond of his wife, a good- 
natured, rollicking fellow, who joked with every one. 
Don't blame Joe too severely. Her soul, restricted by 
its own nature and stinted experience, had only the 



 

wants its limited range allowed. Her fancies were 
neither broad nor varied. Yet she could have enjoyed 
happiness keenly if it had come to her. O, let us hope 
that God has some great joy in store for all the poor 
souls who have missed it here ! 

So Joe crept away to bed and cried a little. And 
Stephen stood under the silent stars, thinking, revolv- 
ing the tangled web that appeared to grow more intri- 
cate at every turn. 

The socialistic theories of Gilbert had not gained 
much ground with him. He was too clear-eyed. Men 
blinded by some passion or interest are more likely to 
take them up. Perhaps, too, he was gradually finding 
his way into the niche he fitted. Since his permanent 
change to the forge he had been happier. His mind 
seemed to assimilate with these mighty engines that 
grew beneath ponderous hammers and blazing fires. It 
was almost like creating a sentient being, when you put 
these rods, and pistons, and valves together, and inflated 
a steam chest from the huge boiler. That gave it life. 
Then it flew up and down, wheels revolved ; the force 
of a giant was in it. And Stephen smiled, seeing this. 
The Phalanstery, with its special affinities, its harmo- 
nies of beauty and nature, faded from his brain. His 
work was here. Men had spent their whole lives study- 
ing some trick of a machine or engine. And when Ad- 
ams, the foreman of this department, said, one day, 

"Dane, you have the head and the eye for an in- 




ventor. Some time I expect we shall hear from you. 
You see more in these things than a bit of hot or cold 
iron." A flush overspread Stephen Dane's swarthy face. 

So much was needed. How was he ever to accom- 
plish it ? Education first. And then he realized how 
ignorant he was. 

I think Adams understood the hunger of his soul. 
Occasionally they walked up the street together, talk- 
ing. And presently books were lent, a sort of free- 
masonry among certain men. Vennard, seeing the 
intimacy with his lynx-eye, took the foreman to task. 

"It won't do, Adams. I've seen it tried. These 
men must be made to know their places, and kept in 
them. Their business is to work. The less book- 
knowleflge and science such folks have, the better for 
them. They get above their station. Many a poor 
wretch has ruined himself by .thinking he had genius 
enough for some invention, when he might have lived 
a contented and comfortable life. Plenty of work and 
steady wages are all they need. I have them in pretty 
good order now, and they shall not be tampered with." 

Adams gave in, and was a little more cautious. He 
was no coward, but he knew he could not serve Dane 
by braving Mr. Vennard, and the man interested him 
singularly. 

June made Tregony a garden of fragrance and beauty. 
Roses everywhere. New life in tree and shrub, bird 
and bee. Wayside paths starred with daisies and but- 



 

terctips ; cool nooks entangled with clustering foliage 
and carpeted with rank mosses. The river with its 
murmurous rustle, the sky with its fleecy drifts every- 
where a profusion of summer richness and warmth. 
Stephen Dane felt it as he never had before. Emerging 
from the shadow of a gross, material life, he drank in 
these varied sensations with an almost childish delight. 
It was a new growing up to manhood. 

Now and then he caught a glimpse of Hope Vennard. 
The child looked bright and happy. Once she had 
nodded to him in her free, eager way, and been checked 
by her elegant mamma. He saw that, and bit his lip. 
And once she had been in the foundery. 

They had been trying some experiments with an 
engine. An improvement had been Attempted in the 
saving of steam, and several scientific men had come 
down from the city to witness the trial. All the morn- 
ing they had been deeply engrossed with it ; but alter 
a good dinner and rich wines they felt less energetic. 
So they had invited the ladies over, for Mrs. Ven- 
nard nearly always had a friend or two staying with 
her. Hope accompanied them. 

Stephen always remembered her as she looked on 
this day. Dressed purely in white, her curls fluttering 
like a changeful sea. So winsome, so radiant. And 
while the others talked, she stole to the open door 
through which she had caught a glimpse of Stephen. 

" May I come in ? " 




Stephen stood by a vice, filing some article that re- 
quired careful manipulations. 

" Yes," he answered, with a smile. 

She came and stood by him, plied him with a child's 
numerous and inconsequent questions, all of which he 
was delighted to answer, watching the lids droop over 
the eyes, the color come and go in her sweet face, and 
the curves of the small, scarlet mouth like a cleft
