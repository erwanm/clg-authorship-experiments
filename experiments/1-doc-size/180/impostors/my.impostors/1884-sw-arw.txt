" No," she said. " But I thought perhaps you 
had forgotten me." 

" What made you think that? " 

"You were gone away," she said hesitating, 
" you were busy ; papa said " 

" What did he say ? " 

" He said, probably I would never see you much 
more." 

But here the tears came to view undeniably; 
welled up and filled the eyes and rolled over. Esther brushed them hastily away. 

" And I hadn't the decency to write to you ? Had 
that something to do with it ? " 

" I thought if you had remembered me, you 
would perhaps have written, just a little word," 
Esther confessed with some hesitation and difficulty. Pitt was more touched and sorry than he 
would have supposed before that such a matter 
could make him. 

" Look here, Esther," he said. " There are two 
or three things I want you to take note of. The 
first is, that you must never judge by appearances." 

" Why not ? " asked Esther, considering him and 
this statement together. 

" Because they are deceptive. They mislead." 

" Do they ? " 



 

"Very frequently." 

" What is one to judge by, then ? " 

" Depends. In this case, by your knowledge of 
the person concerned." 

Esther looked at him, and a warmer shine came 
into her eye. 

" Yes," she said, u I thought it was not like you 
to forget. But then, papa said I would not be likely 
to see much more of you ever " (Esther got the 
words out with some difficulty, without however 
breaking down) "and I thought, I had to get 
accustomed to doing without you and I had 
better do it." 

" Why should you not see much more of me ? " 
Pitt demanded energetically. 

" You would be going away " 

" And coming back again ! " 

"But going to England, perhaps." 

"Who said that?" 

" I don't know. I think Mrs. Dallas told papa." 

" Well, now look here, Queen Esther," Pitt said 
more moderately. " I told you, in the first place 
you are not to judge by appearances. Do you see 
that you have been mistaken in judging me ? " 

She looked at him, a look that moved him a good 
deal, there was so much wistfulness in it; so much 
desire revealed to find him what she had found 
him in times past, along with the dawning hope 
that she might. 

" Yes," said he nodding, " you have been mistaken, 
and I did not, expect it of you, Queen Esther. I 





don't think I am changeable, but anyhow, I haven't 
changed towards you. I have but just got home 
this evening; and I ran away from home and my 
mother as soon as we had done supper, that I 
might come and see you." 

Esther smiled : she was pleased, he saw. 

" And in the next place, as to that crotchet of 
your not seeing much more of me, I can't imagine 
how it ever got up ; but it isn't true, anyhow. I 
expect you'll see an immense deal of me. I may 
go sometime to England; about that I can't tell; 
but if I go, I shall come back again, supposing I 
am alive. And now do you see that it would be 
very foolish of you to try to get accustomed to 
doing without me ? for I shall not let you do it." 

" I don't want to do it," said Esther confidingly ; 
" for you know I have nobody else except you and 
papa." 

" What put such an absurd notion in your head? 
You a Stoic, Queen Esther ! You look like it ! " 

"What is a Stoic?" 

" The sort of people that bite a nail in two, and 
smile as if it were a stick of peppermint candy." 

" I didn't know there were any such people." 

"No, naturally. So it won't do for you to try 
to imitate them." 

" But I was not trying anything like that." 

" What were you trying to do, then ? " 

Esther hesitated. 

" I thought I must do without you ; and so I 
thought I had better not think about you." 



 

" Did you succeed ? " 

" Not very well. But I suppose I could, in time." 

" See you don't ! What do you think in that 
case I should do ? " 

"0 you" said Esther, " that is different. I 
thought you would not care." 

" Did you ! You did me honour. Now Queen 
Esther, let us understand this matter. I do care, 
and I am going to care, and I shall always care. 
Do you believe it ? " 

" I always believe what you say," said the girl, 
with a happy change in her face, which touched 
Pitt again curiously. Somehow, the contrast be 
tween his own strong, varied, rich and active life, 
with its abundance of resources and enjoyments, 
careless and satisfied, and this little girl alone at 
home with her cranky father, and no variety or 
change or outlook or help, struck him painfully. 
It would hardly have struck most young men ; but 
Pitt, with all his rollicking waywardness and self- 
pleasing, had a fine fibre in him which could feel 
things. Then Esther's nature, he knew, was one 
rich in possibilities ; to which life was likely to bring 
great joy or great sorrow; more probably both. 

"What book have you got there?" he asked 
suddenly. 

"Book? 0, the Bible." 

" The Bible ! That's something beyond your 
comprehension, isn't it?" 

" No," said Esther. " What made you think it 
was ? "
