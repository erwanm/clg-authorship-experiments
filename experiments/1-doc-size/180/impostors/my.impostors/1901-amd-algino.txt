She blushed, and hung her head. 

“Well, we must see. There are plenty of chances for 
a young man of energy. And it is best for young people 
to marry before they are given over to other things. It 
is 'a great thing for people to be happy like your sister.” 

The others were coming up. Zenobie’s heart was all 
in a flutter. How had she dared be so frank? And she 
wondered more than ever why she should have cared 
for Gervaise Aubreton. There was something about him 
so different from most of the young men she met, the 
new, enthusiastic life. But, oh, how angry little Sylvie 
would be ! 

Sylvie said one Sunday morning, “I don’t see why you 
go to the cathedral, now that we have a chapel of our 
own.” 

There had been a small Protestant chapel built, now 
that Spain’s hand had been removed. 

“I like Pere Antoine. And the music. Henri and I 
walk down together,” returned Gervaise. 

She did not suspect Zenobie Lavalette any more. 

Hortense was delighted with her own wedding. Her 
gowns were the prettiest that could be had; Aunt Mela- 
nie looked after that. And there were some jewels that 
had been her mother’s, some handsome gifts from her 




father. And it did her foolish little heart a great deal 
of good to think she should be married before Zenobie. 

“Zenobie is kind of stiff and grand, and some day she 
will have the gift of a comb and St. Catharine’s hair will 
be ready for her.” 

“But why?” queried Sylvie. 

“Oh, that is what unmarried women do,” and Hortense 
laughed. “Little one, it will soon be time for you to 
think of lovers.” 

“I am not going to have any.” 

“But you cannot make love to a crane all your life! 
And presently one begins to grow old.” 

It was a grand wedding, and Gervaise was one of the 
attendants. Just then some wonderful good fortune 
happened to Gervaise. Monsieur Poydras discussed his 
capabilities with Monsieur Norton, and proffered him 
a fine position. 

“I don’t know how to thank you,” he said, gratefully, 
to Norton. “Of course, it was your influence.” 

“Why, not altogether. He had his eye on you. It is 
a chance out of a thousand. Before you are gray-haired 
you will be one of the solid men of the town, unless there 
come a fire or a pestilence or a deluge from the mighty 
river, or a general ruin.” 

Gervaise laughed gayly. Then he laid his case before 
M. Lavalette, who had always taken a very kindly interest 
in the young fellow. 

Madame Lavalette was not quite so buoyant. To be 
sure, he was cousin to a marquis, but even the Marquis 
de Marigny, elegant, aristocratic, witty, and charming, 
not infrequently laid aside his title. And as a part of 
this new United States, which she really did not admire, 
there would soon be no distinctions. 

Zenobie came down one day bent on charming everybody. 
She paid a pretty deference to Madame Champe, 
she had a dainty respect, like that of a younger sister, for 
Mam’selle Saucier, and to Sylvie she was irresistible. 
She petted the crane, who really was very amiable; she 
read Laure Gorgas’s letter, and was glad she was so 
happy. She was doing some beautiful needlework which 
she brought along, and she praised Sylvie’s English read- 
ing, though she could not understand half of it. The 
French verses delighted her. 

“Oh, what a wise little body you are!” she said, with 
a soft ripple of merriment. “You will soon be as learned 
as M. Poydras, and you are so young too.” 

“Now you are laughing at me.” 

“No. You are a charming little thing. And at first 
I had made up my mind not to like you at all. Laure 
Gorgas said so much about you. And Hortense was so 
extravagant.” 

“And I said I never would like you.” Sylvie looked 
up out of clear, laughing eyes. 

“I want you to like me very much,” and Zenobie’s tone 
had a sweet seriousness in it. “I want to be like an older 
sister to you. And when I have a home of my own you 
must come and spend days and days, just as you do with 
Claire.” 

“Oh, that will be delightful,” the child said, innocently. 

“And if I should marry and have a little girl, I should 
call her Sylvie. And if there were two, the next one 
should be Angelique.” 

“I wish I wasn’t too old to have dolls,” said Sylvie, 
irrelevantly. 

The next time she went up to Lavalette she found 
Felice had improved very much. Only there was no one 
just her age, and somehow she felt a lonely little girl 
with all the pleasures and all the beauty there was in the 




world. Every one had some person to love her supremely. 
Monsieur Norton adored Angel, and Angel loved him. 
He was to be her husband. The thought brought back 
Sylvie’s bitter grief when she had first learned that Ger- 
vaise could be only her friend; alas, that he cared to be 
nothing more ! Of course, it would have been very un- 
fortunate if he had — only — she was to be quite free from 
the dreadful complication. 

But down in the bottom of her heart she knew she did 
not love Gervaise as Angel loved M’sieu Norton. Why, 
sometimes she thought she liked him quite as well as 
Gervaise, who seemed to consider her still a little girl, 
and not capable of understanding reasons for incidents 
or actions. M’sieu Norton always explained things so 
beautifully. She used to lie in the hammock, and listen 
as he read aloud to Angel. One story interested her so 
much — it was about the wanderings of a man called 
Ulysses and all his curious adventures. Gervaise did not 
care much for poetry nowadays. Then there was “Tele- 
maque,” that she was reading in the French. 

And now Gervaise was going up to Lavalette continu- 
ally. 

“Oh, Angel, suppose Gervaise should want to marry 
Zenobie some day ?” she cried, suddenly, as she sat sewing 
one morning. 

“Well?” returned Angelique, softly. 

“I could not bear that; indeed, I could not.” 

“But if he loved her?” 

“He would have to be a Catholic.” 

“I suppose your friend, Laure’s husband, was not a 
Catholic ?” 

Sylvie wondered about that. 

“Think how many of your splendid heroes were Catho- 
lics. De Tonti and La Salle and De Bienville and Galvez 





and many another. To be good and true and noble and 
self-sacrificing and loving belong to all religions. And 
if a hundred or so years ago we had remained Catholics,
