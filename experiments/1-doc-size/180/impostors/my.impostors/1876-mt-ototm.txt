of the boys had long been persons of consideration 
among us, because they had been to St. Louis once 
and had a vague general knowledge of its wonders, 
but the day of their glory was over now. Thev 
lapsed into a humble silence, and learned to disap- 
pear when the ruthless " cub"-engineer approached. 
This fellow had money, too, and hair oil. Also an 
ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watcli 
chain He wore a leather belt and used no sus- 
penders. If ever a youth was cordially admired 
and hated by his comrades, this one was. No girl 
could withstand his charms. He "cutout" every 
boy in the village. When his boat blew up at last, 
it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such 
as we had not known for months. But when he 
came home the next week, alive, renowned, and 
appeared in church all battered up and bandaged, 
a shining hero, stared at and wondered over by 
everybody, it seemed to us that the partiality of 
Providence for an undeserving reptile had reached 
a point where it was open to criticism. 

This creature's career could produce but one 
result, and it speedily followed. Boy after boy 
managed to get on the river. The minister's sou 
became an engineer. The doctor's and the post- 
master's sons became " mud clerks ;" the wholesal*' 
liquor dealer's son became a bar-keeper on a boat ; 
four sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of 
the county judge, became pilots. Pilot was the 
grandest position of all. The pilot, even in those 
days of trivial wages, had a princely salary — from 
a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dol- 
lars a month, and no board to pay. Two months 
of his wages would pay a preacher's salary for a 
var. Now some of us were left disconsolate. We 
could not get on the river — at least our parents 
would not let us. 

So, by-andby, I ran away. I said I never would 
come home again till T was a pilot and could come 
in glory. But somehow I could not manage it. I 
went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay 
packed together like sardines at the hmg St. Louis 
wharf, and very humbly inquired for the pilots, but 
got only a cold shoulder and short words from 
mates and clerks. I had to make the best of this 
sort of treatment for the time being, but I had 
comforting day-dreams of a future when I should 
be a great and honored pilot, with plenty of money, 
and could kill some of these mates and clerks and 
pay for them. 

Months afterward the hope within me struggled 
to a reluctant death, and I found myself without 
an ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. I 
was in Ciuciimfiti, and I set to work to map out a 
new career. I had been reading about the recent 
exploration of the river Amazon by an expedition 
sent out by our government. Tt was said that the 
expedition, owing to difficulties, had not thoroughly 
ex})lored a part of the country lying about the 
head-waters, some four thousand miles from the 
mouth of the river. It was only al)out fifteen hun- 
dred miles from Cincinnati to New Orleans, where 
I could doubtless get a ship. I had thii-ty dollars 
left ; I would go a,nd complete the exploration of 
the Amazon. This was all the thought I gave to 
the subject. I never was great in matters of detail. 
I packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient 
tub called the Paul Jones, for New Orleans. Foi- 
the sum of sixteen dollars I had the scarred and 
tarnished splendors of " her" main saloon princi- 
pa.ly to myself, for she was not a creature to attract 
the eye of wiser travelers. 

When we presently got under weigh and went 
poking down the broad Ohio, I became a new being, 
and the subject of my own admii'ation. I was a 
traveler ! A word never had tasted so good in my 
mouth before. I had an exultant sense of being 
bound for mysterious lands and distant climes 
which I never have felt in so uplifting a degree 
since. IT was in such a glorified condition that all 
ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I was able 
to look down and pity the untraveled with a com- 
passion that had hardly a trace of contempt in it. 
Still, Avhen we stopped at villages and wood-yards, 
I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings 
of the boiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country 
boys on the bank If they did not seem to dis- 
cover me, I presently sneezed to attract their atten- 
tion, or moved to a position where they could not 
help seeing me. And as soon as I knew they saw 
me I gaped and stretched, and gave other signs of 
being mightily bored with traveling. 

[ kept my hat off all the time, and stayed where 
tho wind aiul tlio sun could strike nie, ]>ecaus(' I 
wantod to get the bronzed and weather-beaten look 
of an old traveler. Before the second day was half 
gone, I experienced a joy which filled me with the 
purest gratitude; for I saw that the skin had l)egun 
to blister and peel off my face and neck. I wished 
that the boys and girls at home could see me now. 

We reached Louisville in time — at last the 
neiirhborhood of it. We stuck hard and fast on 
the rocks in the middle of the river and lay there 
four days. I was now beginning to feel a strong 
sense of being a part of the Ijoat's famil}', a sort of 
infant scm to the captain and younger brother to 
the officers. There is no estimating the pride I 
took in this grandeur, or the affection that began 
to swell and grow in me for those people. I could 
not know how the lordly steamboatman .scorns that 
sort of presumption in a mere landsman. I par- 
ticularly longed to acquire the least trifle of notice 
from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert 
for an oppoi'tunity to do him a service to that end. 
It came at last. The riotous powwow of setting a 
spar was going on down on the forecastle, and I 
went down there and stood around in the way — or 
mostly skipping out of it — till the mate suddenly 
roared a general order for somebody to biing him 
a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said : 
" Tell me where it is— I'll fetch it ! " 

If a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic 
service for the Emperor of Russia, the monarch 
could not have been more astounded than theniate 
was. He even stopped swearing. He stood and 
stared down at me. It took him t seconds to 
scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then 
he said impressively : " Well, if this don't beat 
hell ! " and turned to his work with the air of a 
man who had beeu confronted with a problem too 
abstruse for solution. 

I crept away, and courted solitude for the rest 
of the day. I did not go to dinner ; I stayed away 
from supper until everybody else had finished. I 
did not feel so much like a member of the boat's 
family now as before. However, my spirits re- 
turned, in installments, as we pursued our way 
down the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, 
because it was not in (young) human nature not to 
admire him. He was huge and muscular, his face 
was bearded and whiskered all over ; he had a red 
woman and a blue woman tattooed on his right 
arm, — one on each side of a blue anchor witk a red 
rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was 
perfect. When he was getting out cargo at a land- 
ing, I was always where I could see and hear. He 
felt all the sublimity of his great position, and 
made the world feel it, too. When he gave even 
the simplest order, he discharged it like a blast of 
lightning, and sent a long, reverberating peal of 
profanity thundering after it. I could not help 
contrasting the way in which the average lands- 
man would give an order, with the mate's way of 
doing it. If the landsman should wish the gang- 
plank moved a foot further forward, he would pro- 
bably say : " James, or William, one of you push 
that plank forward, please ; " but put the mate in 
his place, and he would roar out : " Here, now, 
start that gang-plank for'ard ! Lively, now! What're 
you about ! Snatch it ! snatch it ! There ! there ! 
Aft again ! aft again ! Don't you hear me ? Dash it 
to dash! are you going to sleej) over it! 'Vast 
heaving. 'Vast heaving, T tell you ! Going to 
heave it clear astern ? WHERE're you going 
with that barrel I forard with it 'fore I make you 
swallow it, you dash-dash-dash-cise( split be- 
tween a tired mud-turtle and a crippled hearse- 
horse !" 

I wished I could talk like that. 

When the soreness of my adventure with the
