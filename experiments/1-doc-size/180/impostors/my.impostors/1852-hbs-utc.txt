he could bear torture and fire, bear anything, with the vision 
of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond ; but when he was 
gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back the 
pain of his bruised and weary limbs, came back the sense of 
his utterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate : and the day 
passed wearily enough. 

Long before his wounds were healed, Legree insisted that 
he should be put to the regular field-work ; and then came 



day after day of pain and weariness, aggravated by every 
kind of injustice and indignity that the ill-will of a mean 
and malicious mind could devise. Whoever, in our circumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations 
which for us usually attend it, must know the irritation 
that comes with it. Tom no longer wondered at the 
habitual surliness of his associates ; nay, he found the 
placid, sunny temper which had been the habitude of his 
life broken in on and sorely strained by the inroads of the 
same thing. He had nattered himself on leisure to read his 
Bible, but there was no such thing as leisure there. In the 
height of the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all 
his hands through Sundays and week-days alike. "Why 
shouldn't he? He made more cotton by it, and gained 
his wager ; and if it wore out a few more hands, he could 
buy better ones. At first Tom used to read a verse or 
two of his Bible, by the nicker of the fire, after he had 
returned from his daily toil ; but, after the cruel treatment 
he received, he used to come home so exhausted that his 
head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to read, and he 
was fain to stretch himself down with the others in utter 
exhaustion. 

Is it strange that the religious peace and trust which had 
upborne him hitherto should give way to tossings of soul 
and despondent darkness. The gloomiest problem of this 
mysterious life was constantly before his eyes : souls crushed 
and ruined, evil triumphant, and God silent. It was weeks 
and months that Tom wrestled, in his own soul, in darkness 
and sorrow. He thought of Miss Ophelia's letter to his 
Kentucky friends and would pray earnestly that God would 
send him deliverance ; and then he would watch, day after 
day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent to redeem 
him ; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his 
soul bitter thoughts that it was vain to serve God, that 
God had forgotten him. He sometimes saw Gassy; and 
sometimes, when summoned to the house, caught a glimpse 
of the dejected form of Emmeline, but held very little communion with either ; in fact, there was no time for him to 
commune with anybody. 

One evening he was sitting in utter dejection and pros- 
tration by a few decayed brands, where his coarse supper 







was baking. He put a few bits of brushwood on the fire, 
and strove to raise the light, and then drew his worn Bible 
from his pocket. There were all the marked passages which 
had thrilled his soul so often words of patriarchs and seers, 
poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to 
man voices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever 
surround us in the race of life. Had the word lost its 
power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer 
answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration ? Heavily 
sighing, he put it in his pocket. A coarse laugh roused 
him ; he looked up Legree was standing opposite to him. 

"Well, old boy," he said, "you find your religion don't 
work, it seems ! I thought I should get that through your 
wool at last ! " 

The cruel taunt was more than hunger, and cold, and 
nakedness. Tom was silent. 

" You were a fool," said Legree ; " for I meant to do well 
by you when I bought you. You might have been better 
off than Sambo, or Quimbo either, and had easy times ; and, 
instead of getting cut up and thrashed every day or two, ye 
might have had liberty to lord it round, and cut up the 
other niggers ; and ye might have had, now and then, a good 
warming of whiskey-punch. Come, Tom, don't you think 
you'd better be reasonable ? Heave that ar' old pack of 
trash in the fire and join my church ! " 

" The Lord forbid'! " said Tom, fervently. 

" You see the Lord an't going to help you ; if he had 
been, he wouldn't have let me get you ! This yer religion is 
all a mess of lying trumpery, Tom. I know all about it. 
Te'd better hold to me ; I'm somebody, and can do 
something ! " 

" No, mas'r," said Tom, " I'll hold on. The Lord may 
help me, or not help ; but I'll hold to Him, and believe Him 
to the last ! " 

" The more fool you ! " said Legree, spitting scornfully at 
him, and spurning him with his foot. " Never mind, I'll 
chase you down yet, and bring you under, you'll see ! " and 
Legree turned away. 

"When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level 
at which endurance is possible, there is an instant and des- 
perate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off 





the weight ; and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes 
'a return tide of joy and courage. So was it now with Tom. 
The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before dejected soul to the lowest ebb ; and though the hand of faith 
still held to the eternal Rock, it was with a numb, despairing 
grasp. Tom sat like one stunned at the fire. Suddenly 
everything around him seemed to fade, and a vision rose 
before him of One crowned with thorns, buffeted and 
bleeding. Tom gazed in awe and wonder at the majestic 
patience of the face ; the deep pathetic eyes thrilled him to 
his inmost heart ; his soul woke, as, with floods of emotion, 
he stretched out his hands and fell upon his knees ; when 
gradually the vision changed, the sharp thorns became rays 
of glory, and in splendour inconceivable he saw that same 
face bending compassionately towards him, and a voice said, 
" He that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, 
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father 
on his throne." 

How long Tom lay there he knew not. "When he came 
to himself, the fire was gone out, his clothes were wet with 
the chill and drenching dews ; but the dread soul-crisis was 
past, and, in the joy that filled him, he no longer felt hunger, 
cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness. From his 
deepest soul, he that hour loosed and parted from every hope 
in the life that now is, and offered his own will an unques- 
tioning sacrifice to the Infinite. Tom looked up to the 
silent, ever-living stars, types of the angelic hosts who ever 
look down on man ; and the solitude of the night rung with 
the triumphant words of a hymn, which he had sung often 
in happier days, but never with such feeling as now : 

" The earth shall be dissolved like snow, 

The sun shall cease to shine ; 
But God, who called me here below, 
Shall be for ever mine. 

" And when this mortal life shall fail, 

And flesh and sense shall cease, 
I shall possess within the veil 
A life of joy and peace. 

" When we've been there ten thousand years 

Bright shining like the sun, 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun." 




Those who have been familiar with the religious histories 
of the slave-population, know that relations like what we 
have narrated are very common among them. We have 
heard some from their own lips of a very touching and 
affecting character. The psychologist tells us of a state in 
which the affections and images of the mind become so 
dominant and overpowering, that they press into their 
service the outward senses, and make them give tangible 
shape to the inward imagining. Who shall measure what 
an all-pervading Spirit may do with these capabilities of our 
mortality, or the ways in which He may encourage the 
desponding souls of the desolate ? If the poor forgotten 
slave believes that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him, 
who shall contradict him ? Did He not say that His mission
