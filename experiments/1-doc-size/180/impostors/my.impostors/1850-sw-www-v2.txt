He was silent for a little, and disturbed Ellen thought. 

" Well !" said he at leno-th, — " 'taint the folks that thinks 
themselves the best that is the best always ; — if you aint 
good I should like to know what goodness is. There's 
somebody that thinks you be," said he a minute or two afterwards, as the horses were heard coming to the gate. 

" No, she knows me better than that," said Ellen. 

" It isn't any she that I mean," said ISlr. Van Brunt. — 
" There's somebody else out there, aint there ?" 

" Who ?" said Ellen, — " Mr. John ? — O no indeed he 
don't. It was only this morning he was telling me of something I did that was wrong. — Her eyes watered as she spoke. 

" He must have miglity sharp eyes, then," said Mr. Van 
Brunt, — " for it beats all my powers of seeing things." 
" And so he has," said Ellen, putting on her bonnet, — " he 
always knows what I am thinking of just as well as if I told 
him. Good bye !" 

" Good bye," said he ; — " I ha'n't forgotten what you've 
been saying, and I don't mean to." 

How full of sweet pleasure was the ride home ! 

The " something wrong," of which Ellen had spoken, was 
this. The day before, it happened that Mr. John had broken 
her off from a very engaging book to take her drawing-lesson ; 
and as he stooped down to give a touch or two to the piece 
she was to copy, he said, I don't want you to read any 
more of that Ellie ; it is not a good book for you." Ellen did 
not for a moment question that he was right, nor wish to disobey ; but she had become very much interested, and was a 
good deal annoyed at having such a sudden stop put to her 
pleasure. She said nothing, and went on with her work. In 
a little while Alice asked her to hold a skein of cotton for her 
while she wound it. Ellen was annoyed again at the interruption ; the. harpstrings were jarring yet, and gave fresh 
discord at every touch. She had, however, no mind to let 
her vexation be seen ; she went immediately and held the 
botton, and as soon as it was done sat down again to her 







drawing. Before ten minutes had passed Margery came to 
set the table for dinner; Ellen's papers and desk must 
move. 

" Why it is not dinner-time yet tliis great while, Margery," 
said she ; — " it isn't much after twelve." 

" No, Miss Ellen," said Margery under her breath, for John 
was in one corner of the room reading, — " but by-and-by I'll 
be busy with the chops and frying the salsify, and I couldn't 
leave the kitchen ; — if you'll let me have the table now." 

Ellen said no more, and moved her things to a stand before 
the window ; where she went on with her copying till dinner 
was ready. Whatever the reason was, however, her pencil 
did not work smoothly ; her eye did not see true ; and she 
lacked her usual steady patience. The next morning, after 
an hour and more's work and much painstaking, the drawing 
was finished. Ellen had quite forgotten her yesterday's trouble. But when John came to review her drawing, he found 
several faults with it ; pointed out two or three places in 
which it had suffered from haste and want of care ; and asked 
her how it had happened. Ellen knew it happened yesterday. 
She was vexed ao:ain, thouoh she did her best not to show it ; 
she stood quietly and heard what he had to say. He then 
told her to get ready for her riding lesson. 

" Mayn't I just make this right first?" said Ellen; — "it 
won't take me long." 

" No," said he, — " you have been sitting long enough ; I 
must break you off. The Brownie will be here in ten 
minutes." 

Ellen was impatiently eager to mend the bad places in her 
drawing, and impatiently displeased at being obliged to ride 
first. Slowly and reluctantly she went to get ready ; John 
was already gone ; she would not have moved so leisurely if 
he had been anywhere within seeing distance. As it was, 
she found it convenient to quicken her movements ; and was 
at the door ready as soon as he and the Brownie. She was 
soon thoroughly engaged in the management of herself and 
her horse ; a little smart riding shook all the ill-humor out of 
her, and she was entirely herself again. Atthe.end of fifteen 
or twenty minutes they drew up under the shade of a tree to 
lot the Brownie rest a little. It was a warm day and John 
had taken off his hat and stood resting too, with his arm 





leaning on the neck of the horse. Presently he looked round 
to Ellen, and asked her, with a smile, if she felt right 
again ? 

" Why ?" said Ellen, the crimson of her cheeks mounting 
to her forehead. But her eye sunk immediately at the an- 
swering glance of his. He then in very few words set the 
matter before her, with such a happy mixture of pointedness 
and kindness, that while the reproof, coming from him, went 
to the quick, Ellen yet joined with it no thought of harshness 
or severity. She was completely subdued however ; the rest 
of the riding-lesson had to be given up ; and for an hour 
Ellen's tears could not be stayed. But it was, and John had 
meant it should be, a strong check given to her besetting sin. 
It had a long and lasting effect. 



 



CHAPTER XL, 



Speed, But tell me true, will 't b.e a match ? 

Laun. Ask my dog ; if he say, ay, it will ; if he say, no, it will ; if he shake his tail 
and say nothing, it will. — Two Gentlemen of Verona. 

In due time Mr. Van Brunt was on his legs again, much 
to everybody's joy, and much to the advantage of fields, 
fences, and grain. Sam and Johnny found they must " spring 
to," as their leader said ; and Miss Fortune declared she was 
thankful she could draw a long breath again, for do what she 
would she couldn't be everywhere. Before this John and the 
Black Prince had departed, and Alice and Ellen were left alone 
again. 

" How long will it be, dear Alice," said Ellen, as they stood 
sorrowfully looking down the road by which he had gone, — 
" before he will be through that — before he will be able to 
leave Doncaster ?" 

" Next summer." 
And what will he do then ?" 

" Then he ^vill be ordained." 

" Ordained ? — what is that ?" 

" He will be solemnly set apart for the work of the ministry, and appointed to it by a number of clergymen." 
. " And then will he come and stay at home, Alice ?" 

" I don't know what then, dear Ellen," said Alice, sighing ; — " he may for a little ; but papa wishes very much that 
before he is settled anywhere he should visit England and 
Scotland and see our friends there. Though I hardly think 
John will do it unless he sees some further reason for going. 
If he do not, he will probably soon be called somewhere — 
Mr. Marshman wants him to come to Randolph. I don't 
know how it will be." 

" Well !" said Ellen, with a kind of acquiescing sigh, — " at 
any rate now we must wait until next Christmas." 







The winter passed with little to mark it except the usual 
visits to Ventnor ; which, however, by common consent AHco 
and Ellen had agreed should not be when John was at home. 
At all other times they were much prized and enjoyed. Every 
two or three months Mr. Marshman was sure to come for 
them, or Mr. Howard, or perhaps the carriage only with a 
letter ; and it was bargained for that Mr. Humphreys should 
follow to see them home. It was not always that Ellen 
could go, but the disappointments were seldom ; she too had 
become quite domesticated at Ventnor, and was sincerely
