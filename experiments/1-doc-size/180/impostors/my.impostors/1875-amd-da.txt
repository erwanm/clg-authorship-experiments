yours. Those were his instructions, he says." 



"Oh!" 

Then Mrs. Tremaine ran down, while pompous Mrs. 
Maybin was nursing a sense* of affront. 

A young man of eighteen or twenty handed her the 
missive in question. He was a stranger, and the hand- 
writing on the envelope quite unknown to her. Its 
contents were simply these : — 

"If Mrs. Tremaine will come immediately to No.—, 
Wall street, she will hear something of the utmost im- 
portance." 

There was also a card enclosed, containing the name 
of "Leonard Colby," and the number of the room. 

"Who sent you?" she asked, abruptly. 

"Mr. Colby. I was to deliver the note to Mrs. Tre- 
maine:" 

He had evidently received no further instructions, 
for he turned away. 

"Is there to be no answer?" 

He stared blankly at the Virginia creeper against the 
column of the portico, 

"He didn't say," 

"Very well." 

She went to her rQom thinking it over. What could 
the mysterious summons be? "Of the utmost impor- 
tance." She did not remember of ever hearing ]Mr, 
Colby's name before — and the whole thing savored of 
mystery. 

Then she turned suddenly and deathly white. What 



if it were something connected with that old, old story ? 
The man she feared and hated, now, was dead, surely. 
For seven years she had not heard a whisper concerning 
him, save the tale of the shipwreck. And yet she 
knew that people did return after years and years of 
absence. There was a horrible constriction in her throat ; 
her parched tongue refused to make the faintest motion, 
although she wanted to cry out with terror. She 
clasped her hands over her throbbing eyes for many 
moments. When, at length, she roused herself, she 
seemed weak, as if after a month's illness. 

"I will go to Ralph, at once," she thought, " I will 
not have any secret from him. He shall hear and 
judge — and if he loves me still " 

Acting upon this impulse, she began to change her 
dress immediately. A dainty gray walking suit, and 
straw hat to match, with a cluster of green leaves and 
scarlet berries. As she put on her gloves, she remarked 
how icy cold her hands were. 

She walked slowly enough now. In the hall she 
paused, and called to Mrs. Maybin. 

" I am going into town a little while." 

She had quite forgotten about her dressmaker, and 
left no orders. 


CHAPTER II. 

AT HOME, ALONE. 

[HE day had been a busy one to Ralph Tremaine, 
and yet, he had hardly thought of the comers 
and goers. His rose had stood in a little vase 
on his desk, all day, and the words — " The wife who 
loves you," had floated through his brain like a chord 
of suggestive music. At the earliest possible moment, 
he turned the business over to the book-keeper, put on 
his hat and coat, and reached out for his rose. He 
felt a little warmth steal into his cheeks as he bungled 
over the pinning. Indeed he had an idea that Lindsay 
was watching him with an amused smile. 

Then he went for the strawberries. They would 
have them in the garden at home,in a week's time, but 
Dora waft extravagantly fond of them, and they looked 
so luscious, so tempting ! There was a little girl selling 
violets. Theirs were out of bloom, and violets were 
another penchant of Dora's, so he must have a bunch. 

With it all, he was ready for the train at four. He 
would surprise her, to-day, by an early return. What 
had she been doing ! Bothering over old dresses — what 
a fuss women always made when there was nothing 
half so pretty as white, and flounces and flirbelows and 



laces were not of much account. But, then,he supposed 
there was no appeal from a dress-maker's fiat. 

To-morrow he would go shopping with Dora. It 
never was any bore, for she did not dawdle over goods, 
and have everything pulled about to gratify her curiosity. 
Then he would buy her something pretty, by way of 
surprise — she had spoken of a coral set — perhaps it 
might be that. 

. He was relieved at the sight of familiar Woodlea, for 
the strawberries had stained the paper through. It was 
but a short walk to the house. The air was so delight- 
fully fragrant, the lawn so smooth and velvety, with 
clumps of blossoming shrubbery,here and there, wigelia, 
lilacs, snowball, rhododendron, and hosts of snowy 
spireas. Dora's window overlooked the avenue, and 
not infrequently, when she heard the sharp click of the 
gate latch, she glanced out. She did not now. He 
hoped Miss Ayers was not still pottering about. 

Somehow the house seemed very, very still. He had 
thought, more than once, of the homes where gtoups of 
children frolicked about, and he had a longing for their 
arch, merry faces and gay voices. Nearly all the houses 
in the row held out such tantalizing pictures. And if a 
small, silvery treble were to say "papa" on this porch— 

"There are some berries, Mrs. Maybin," he said, 
going straight through to the kitchen. "Have you a 
napkin handy, with which I can wipe my hands?" 



She glanced through the door into the spacious hall, 
and then at her master) rather questioning! j. 

"The dinner, will not be ready until six — as you 
gave orders a few days ago. If I had known " 

"Never mind, Mrs. Maybin, it is all right. I do not 
care for dinner any earlier in the summer." 

Then he was off again with his violets. She gave an 
Injured sniff. Hie had never been the same man since 
his marriage. Before that, everything went on like 
clock work. If he was put out five minutes he showed 
it, though never unpleasantly. That was what she 
liked to see — some authority from the head of the 
house. Now the madame twisted him around her fin- 
gers, and everything went at sixes and sevens. If it 
were not that Mr. Tremaine would actually be neglected, 
she should feel tempted to throw up her commission. 
And strawberries bought, when loads of their own were 
ripening in the garden ! 

Ralph Tremaine went up the steps two at a time, and 
entered his wife's sitting-room, smiling at the expecta- 
tion of finding her asleep on the lounge. There was no 
Dora, no dresses strewn about, the willow workstand b}- 
the window covered, and the low sewing chair standing 
in the corner. The blinds all clfosed, the room filled 
with a shady green gloom, and strangely silent. 

"The wife who loves you." Dora's bright, warm 
lips had uttered the words this morning. He wanted 
to hear her say them over dozens of times. Where 

could she be hiding? Oh, Mrs. Maybin could you im- 
agine such an undignified thought finding a resting
