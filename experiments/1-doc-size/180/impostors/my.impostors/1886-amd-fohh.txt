part of the ill luck that had more than once confronted 
her. She was a little cross to Doris, but the young girl 
took it very sweetly. '' She never will have any spirit," 
reflected her aunt. 

But when Doris accepted her aunt and the change to 
her life, the future was such an unknown quantity that 
she was still puzzling over it. Two or three brief and 
pithy sentences madame had let fall in her foreign frank- 
ness. 

" It is such a pity you have no dowry," she had said 
one day. "When you are tired of drifting about, there 
will be no convent to receive you ; you Protestants do not 
believe in them. My dear child, if a good man asks you 
in marriage, do not mind if he is a little older, or perhaps 
plain ; you cannot have your choice, and a great pity it 
is, too." 

Doris had studied her with wide eyes. 

" But do women — all women marry ? " 

''Those who are fortunate enough to have chances." 
And madame made a decisive gesture. 

The girls had talked of it at school, but even now 
marriage seems so far removed from her life ; and when 
her aunt is captious, a vague uneasiness pervades her 
soul. She begins to understand that she has no real 
right to her aunt's bounty ; perhaps, indeed, she is impov- 
erishing her. A certain dismay strikes hard into the 
young soul. She seems balancing herself upon some 
slender staff that bridges the past and the future, and 
sees no secure place on either side. 

Lloyd Wentworth is very careful of himself all the 
afternoon, but he comes down again in the evening ; and 
when the conversation flags, — that is, Doris has not 
talked at all, — he says something about the piano. 

''It pleases madame," she returns, simply. "I sup- 
pose it has the memory and the love of years ago, and 



 



 



 

she does not mind the thin quavering sound, — does not even 
hear it. But I should not want to play for any one else." 

"And you sing?" 

"Yes. Of course, there are much finer voices than 
mine," she replies, with gentle quietude. 

"I used to sing. They sing a great deal at home. I 
wish you could touch the grand piano there. My cousin 
Basil plays magnificently. I should like you to hear 
him. I know that Ave Maria you were singing the other 
evening. Let us try it." 

He hummed a line ; then began in a low tenor voice of 
great sweetness. Doris listens, entranced for the moment ; 
then conscience rouses her to her duty, and she joins him 
simply as a child might. Unworldly, that is the adjective 
which completely describes her. Some grace of nature 
or training will always keep the fine line of propriety 
present in her soul ; but she is just a little different, and 
always will be, from other girls and women. She is so 
utterly unlike Mrs. Gilbert. Wentworth is glad that she 
is, though he can give no good reason for it. 

How soft the voices rise and fall in the beautiful Italian 
tongue, that is melody itself ! That sweet, divine plaint 
to the mother of the Saviour touches them both, and the 
voices falter a little. There are some tears in her eyes, 
but in the odorous dusk they are hidden from sight. 

" You sing with a great deal of feeling," he says, when 
he can command his voice, for he, too, has been deeply 
moved. "It is just the voice for a home fireside." 

Doris is silent. 

" You read to me once ; I should like to hear you read 
again. Then you were charming an evil spirit that has 
left me now. Was I very bad ? " And there is a sound 
like a smile in his tone. 

"You were restless, — yes, it was quite dreadful, be- 
cause you must have suffered severely, and the doctor 
said if you did not sleep, you could not live." 



 



 



 

'' I shall know what to do in the next strait." 

Then he reflects a little. If he goes to Milan — if they 
go elsewhere — never until this moment has he felt utterly 
cut off from the hopes that render youth and life so blest. 
To know his days numbered! A year ago — two weeka 
ago — it had not cost him a pang. But the dread fact is 
there, and he must be brave to face it. Why should he 
want to live simply because he has seen Doris Hawthorne ? 

'' I heard you singing." For once Mrs. Gilbert's mellow 
voice falls discordantly on his soul. '' It sounded de- 
lightfully, for your voices blended so well. Sing some- 
thing for me. Doris knows no end of songs." 

" I believe I have done all I dare do to-night," he makes 
answer, in a quiet tone of authority. '' I was tempted to 
try with Miss Hawthorne, but it is one of the pleasures 
forbidden me." 

Mrs. Gilbert has been answering a letter received but 
not read before dinner. It has tried her sorely. Mr. Gil- 
bert proposes that she shall sell her diamonds to tide her 
over this emergency. '' Luck must change," he says. 
'' If she is living cheaply, she had better stay the remain- 
der of summer, but he advises her to hunt up a husband 
for her niece, or get rid of her in some fashion." 

She faces the fact, or rather the question, will Lloyd 
Wentworth do for a husband? Even a year would be 
something. He is lavish with his money ; he wastes 
enough probably to take care of a wife. She is in a des- 
perate strait, and she resolves to throw these young peo- 
ple together, knowing well that youth and kindred tastes 
are points of danger. 



 



 



CHAPTER ni. 

IN ARCADIB. 

Lloyd Wentworth is amused by, as well as interested in 
this simple, honest Doris Hawthorne. She has not learned 
any lessons of the great world. Her native delicacy is 
finer and more exquisite than any training of studied pro- 
priety. She is retiring, shy at times, but not bashful. 
She can defend herself, and the beliefs she holds sacred, 
in a quiet, heroic way, but she is never aggressive. Her 
aunt puzzles her, that he plainly sees ; for Mrs. Gilbert is 
a very worldly woman, whose great good, and also god I 
may add, is her present enjoyment and advancement. If 
she was in the position she would like, and had money 
enough not to be compelled to resort to all kinds of sub- 
terfuges, she would make a large circle happy. Happi- 
ness is indeed her sun, her light of life, and a very little 
exalts her. Her nature being diffusive, she would fain 
have all others happy as well. Anson Gilbert is a su-
