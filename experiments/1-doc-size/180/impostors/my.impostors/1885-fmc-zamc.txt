figure of the Median. 

" Thou art a faithful servant, Zoroaster," he an- 
b"vered, " and thou ridest as the furies that pursue the 
fc"uls of the wicked — as the devils of the mountains 



 

after a liar. He would not have lasted much farther, 
this bundle of sweating dust. Get up, fellow ! " he 
said, touching Phraortes's head with his toe. " Thou 
liest grovelling there like a swine in a ditch." 

The soldiers raised the exhausted man to his feet. 
The king turned to Zoroaster. 

" Tell me, thou rider of whirlwinds," he said, laughing, " will a man more readily tell the truth, or speak 
lies, when he is tired ? " 

"A man who is tired will do whichever will procure 
him rest," returned Zoroaster, with a smile. 

"Then I will tell this fellow that the sooner he 
speaks the truth the sooner he may sleep," said the 
king. Going near to Zoroaster, he added in an under- 
tone: "Before thou thyself restest, go' and tell the 
queen privately that she send away her slaves, and 
await me and him thou hast brought in a few min- 
utes. This fellow must have a little refreshment, or 
he will die upon the steps." 

Zoroaster turned and went up the broad stairs, and 
threaded the courts and passages, and mounted to the 
terrace where he had first met Atossa before the king's 
apartments. There was no one there, and he was 
about to enter under the great curtain, when the 
queen herself came out and met him face to face. 
Though it was yet very early, she was attired with 
more than usual care, and the faint colours of her 
dress and the few ornaments she wore, shone and 
gleamed brightly in the level beams of the morning 
sun. She had guessed that Zoroaster would return 
that day, and she was prepared for him. 

As she came suddenly upon him, she gave a little 
cry, that mig,'ht well have been feigned. 



 

"What! Are you already returned ? " she asked, 
and the joy her voice expressed was genume. He 
looked so godlike as he stood there in the sunlight — 
her heart leaped for joy of only seeing him. 

" Yes — I bear this message from the Great King to 
the queen. The Great King commands that the 
queen send away her slaves, and await the king and 
him I have brought with me, in the space of a few 
minutes." 

"It is well," answered Atossa. "There are no 
slaves here and I await the king." She was silent a 
moment. " Are you not glad to have come back ? " 
she asked, presently. 

" Yes," said Zoroaster, whose face brightened 
quickly as he spoke. " I am indeed glad to be here 
again. Would not any one be glad to have finished 
such a journey ? " 

The queen stood with her back to the curtained 
doorway and could see down the whole length of the 
balcony to the head of the staircase. Zoroaster faced 
her and the door. As he spoke, Atossa's quick eyes 
caught sight of a figure coming quickly up the last 
steps of the stairway. She recognised Nehushta instantly, but no trembling of her lids or colouring of 
her cheek, betrayed that she had seen the approach 
of her enemy. She fixed her deep-blue eyes upon 
Zoroaster's, and gazing somewhat sadly, she spoke in 
low and gentle tones : 

" The time has seemed long to me since you rode 
away, Zoroaster," she said. 

Zoroaster, astonished at the manner in which she 
spoke, turned pale, and looked down coldly at her 



 

beautiful face. At that moment Nehushta stepped 
upon the smooth marble pavement of the balcony. 

Still Atossa kept her e3xs fixed on Zoroaster's. 

" You answer me nothing ? " she said in broken 
tones. Then suddenly, as though acting under an 
irresistible impulse, she threw her arms wildly about 
his neck and kissed him passionately again and again. 

" Oh Zoroaster, Zoroaster, my beloved I" she cried, 
" you must never, never leave me again ! " And 
again she kissed him, and fell forward upon his 
breast, holding him so tightly that, for a moment, he 
did not know which way to move. He put his hands 
upon her shoulders, to her waist — to try to push her 
from him. But it was in vain ; she clung to him 
desperately and sobbed upon his breast. 

In the sudden and fearful embarrassment in which 
he was placed, he did not hear a short, low groan far 
off behind him, nor the sound of quickly retreating 
steps upon the stairs. But Atossa heard and rejoiced 
fiercely; and when she looked up, Nehushta was 
gone, with the incurable wound in her breast. 

Atossa suddenly let her arms fall from the war- 
rior's neck, looked into his eyes once, and then, with 
a short, sharp cry, she buried her face in her hands 
and leaned back against the door-post by the heavy 
striped curtain. 

" Oh, my God ! What have I done ? " she moaned. 

Zoroaster stood for one moment in hesitation and 
doubt. It seemed as though he had received a sudden revelation of numberless things he had never 
understood. He spoke quietly, at last, with a great 
effort, and his voice sounded kindly. 



 

" I thank the good powers that I do not love thee 
— and I would that thou didst not love me. For I 
am the Great King's servant, faithful to death — and 
if I loved thee I should be a liar, and a coward, and 
the basest of all mankind. Forget, I pray thee, that 
thou hast spoken, and let me depart in peace. For 
the Great King is at hand, and thou must not suffer 
that he find thee weeping, lest he think thou fearest 
to meet Phraortes the Median face to face. Forget, 
I pray thee — and forgive thy servant if he have 
done anything amiss." 

Atossa looked up suddenly. Her eyes were bright 
and clear, and there was not a trace of tears in them. 
She laughed harshly. 

"I — weep before the king ! You do not know 
me. Go, if thou wilt. Farewell, Zoroaster," — her 
voice softened a little, — " farewell. It may be that 
you shall live, but it may be that you shall die, 
because I love you." 

Zoroaster bent his head in respectful homage, and 
turned and went his way. The queen looked after 
him, and as he disappeared upon the staircase, she 
began to smooth her head-dress and the locks of her 
golden hair, and for a moment, she smiled sweetly to 
herself. 

" That was a mortal wound, well dealt," she said 
aloud. But as she gazed out over the city, her face 
grew grave and thoughtful. " But I do love him," 
she added softly, "I do — I do— I loved him long 
ago." She turned quickly, as though fearing some 
one had overheard her. " How foolish I am ! " she 
exclaimed impatiently; and she turned and passed 



 

away under the heavy curtain, leaving the long
