'But,' said he, defending himself, 'any of the previous suitors might
have said the same.'

'Undoubtedly,' replied Khaled, unabashed. 'But they did not say it. Your
majesty will certainly now consider the matter.'

'In the meanwhile,' the Sultan answered, very graciously, 'you are my
guest, and you have come in time to take part in the third day of the
feast, to which you are welcome in the name of Allah, the merciful.'

Thereupon the Sultan rose and Khaled was conducted to the apartments set
apart for the guests. But the Sultan returned to the harem in a very
thoughtful mood, and before long he found Zehowah who had returned to
her seat in the balcony.

'This is a very strange suitor,' he said, shaking his head and looking
into his daughter's face.

'He is at least bold and outspoken,' she answered. 'He makes no secret
of his poverty nor of his wishes. Whatever he be, he is in earnest and
speaks truth. I would like well to know the only secret which he wishes
to keep--who he really is.'

'It may be,' said the Sultan thoughtfully, 'that if I threaten to cut
off his head he will tell us. But on the other hand, he is a guest.'

'He is not of those who are easily terrified, I think. Tell me, my
father, do you wish me to marry him?'

'How could you marry a man who has no family and no inheritance? Would
such a marriage befit the daughter of kings?'

'Why not?' asked Zehowah with much calmness.

The Sultan stared at her in astonishment.

'Has this stranger enchanted your imagination?' he inquired by way of
answer.

'No,' replied Zehowah scornfully. 'I have seen the noblest, the most
beautiful and the richest of the earth, ready to take me to wife, and I
have not loved. Shall I love an outcast?'

'Then how can you ask my wishes?'

'Because there are good reasons why I should marry this man.'

'Good reasons? In the name of Allah let me hear them, if there are any.'

'You are old, my father,' said Zehowah, 'and it has not pleased heaven
to send you a son, nor to leave you any living relation to sit upon the
throne when your years are accomplished. You must needs think of your
successor.'

'The better reason for choosing some powerful prince, whose territory
shall increase the kingdom he inherits from me, and whose alliance shall
strengthen the empire I leave behind me.'

'Istaghfir Allah! The worse reason. For such a prince would be attached
to his own country, and would take me thither with him and would neglect
the kingdom of Nejed, regarding it as a land of strangers whom he may
oppress with taxes to increase his own splendour. And this is not
unreasonable, since no king can wisely govern two kingdoms separated
from each other by more than three days' journey. No man can have other
than the one of two reasons for asking me in marriage. Either he has
heard of me and desires to possess me, or he wishes to increase his
dominions by the inheritance which will be mine.'

'Doubtless, this is the truth,' said the Sultan. 'But so much the more
does this stranger in all probability covet my kingdom, since he has
nothing of his own.'

'This is what I mean. For, having no other possessions to distract his
attention, he will remain always here, and will govern your kingdom for
its own advantage in order that it may profit himself.'

'This is a subtle argument, my daughter, and one requiring
consideration.'

'The more so because the man seems otherwise well fitted to be my
husband, since he is a true believer, and young, and fearless and
outspoken.'

'But if this is all,' objected the Sultan, 'there are in Nejed several
young men, sons of my chief courtiers, who possess the same
qualifications. Choose one of them.'

'On the contrary, to choose one of them would arouse the jealousy of all
the rest, with their families and slaves and freedmen, whereby the
kingdom would easily be exposed to civil war. But if I take a stranger
it is more probable that all will be for him, since you are beloved, and
there is no reason why one party should oppose him and another support
him, since none of them know anything of him.'

'But he will not be beloved by the people unless he is liberal, and he
has nothing wherewith to be generous.'

'And where are the treasures of Riad?' laughed Zehowah. 'Is it not easy
for you to go secretly to his chamber and to give him as much gold as he
needs?'

'That is also true. I see that you have set your heart upon him.'

'Not my heart, my father, but my head. For I have infinitely more head
than heart, and I see that the welfare of the kingdom will be better
secured with such a ruler, than it would have been under a foreign
prince whose right hand would be perpetually thrust out to take in Nejed
that which his left hand would throw to courtiers in his own country. Do
I speak wisdom or folly?'

'It is neither all folly nor all wisdom.'

'I have seen this man, I have heard him speak,' said Zehowah. 'He is as
well as another since I must marry sooner or later. Moreover I have
another argument.'

'What is that?'

'Either he is a man strong enough to rule me, or he is not,' Zehowah
answered with a laugh. 'If he can govern me, he can govern the kingdom
of Nejed. But if not I will govern it for him, and rule him also.'

The Sultan looked up to heaven and slightly raised his hands from his
knees.

'Allah is merciful and forgiving!' he exclaimed. 'Is this the spirit
befitting a wife?'

'Is it charity to cause happiness?'

'Undoubtedly it is charity.'

'And which is greater, the happiness of many or the happiness of one?'

'The happiness of many is greater,' answered the Sultan. 'What then?' he
asked after a time, seeing that she said nothing more.

'I have spoken,' she replied. 'It is best that I should marry him.'

Then there was silence for a long time, during which the Sultan sat
quite motionless in his place, watching his daughter, while she looked
idly through the lattice at the people who came and went in the court
below. She seemed to feel no emotion.

The Sultan did not know how to oppose Zehowah's will any more than he
could answer her arguments, although his worldly wisdom was altogether
at variance with her decision. For she was the beloved child of his old
age and he could refuse her nothing. Moreover, in what she had said,
there was much which recommended itself to his judgment, though by no
means enough to persuade him. At last he rose from the carpet and
embraced her.

'If it is your will, let it be so,' he said.

'It is the will of Allah,' answered Zehowah. 'Let it be accomplished
immediately.'

With a sigh the Sultan withdrew and sent a messenger to Khaled
requesting him to come to another and more secluded chamber, where they
could be alone and talk freely.

Khaled showed no surprise on hearing that his suit was accepted, but he
thought it fitting to express much gratitude for the favourable
decision. Then the Sultan, who did not wish to seem too readily
yielding, began to explain to Khaled Zehowah's reasons for accepting a
poor stranger, presenting them as though they were his own.

'For,' he said, 'whatever you may in reality be, you have chosen to
present yourself to us in such a manner as would not have failed to
bring about a refusal under any other circumstances. But I have
considered that as it will be your destiny, if heaven grants you life,
to rule my kingdom after me, you will in all likelihood rule it more
wisely and carefully, for having no other cares in a distant country to
distract your attention; and because you have no relations you are the
less liable to the attacks of open or secret jealousy.'

The Sultan then gave him a large sum of money in gold pieces, which
Khaled gladly accepted, since he had not even wherewithal to buy himself
a garment for the wedding feast, still less to distribute gifts to the
